I can't! My circuits are fried! They're fried I tell you!!
Good!
Hey!
Oh my God! I love things. What happened?
Hey. So, what did he say?
Well, we just decided that Rachel is gonna be your maid of honor.
Everbody this is Frank! This is my half-brother Frank.
Just one last time erm... the marriage thing... there's no wiggle room? None at all?
I was in charge of cups.
It's a Ms. Pac-Man machine!!
You won't let go?
Oh, Ja! Ja!
Yeah. I really like his glasses.
Oh. Okay, well I-I was kinda hoping that I would just...be alone y'know to think about my mom and her suicide.
There you go, that's the spirit! Okay! Now, if you need money, I will lend you money, but just get moving!
Hey!-Hey! What's going on?
Yeah, I agree. Ya know, I think fancy parties are only fun if you're fancy on the inside and I'm just not sure we are.
Oh, he has a gig. I kinda like being married to a rock star, you know. My husband has a gig.
I'm talking about massages.
Oh no no.
Just, you know, to see... um.
I thought I was going home to go to bed, but I'm sensing there's something less fun for me to do here.
Because you would rather live here with Joey.
Ooh, this is it! Oh, that's him! That's him!
Well, y'know we don't call it that, but yeah!
What?
Do you like car games?
I can't believe it! I did it! I rode a bike! I never thought I'd be able to do that! Thank you Ross.
Now do me, do my back. Oh come on, harder.
Tails!
I hope you were using protection.
What?
Okay, it's okay.
Yeah, my mom sent me a family heirloom that once belonged to my grandmother. Can you believe it?! A year ago I didn't even have a family, and now I have heirlooms for crying out loud.
Mike, let me ask you something. How many sisters does Joey have?
Yeah! Or too, you could be two stockbrokers and you're-you're-you're rolling around naked on the trading floor and everybody's watching! It never happened.
I'm sorry.
YOU'RE SO GENEROUS AND KIND AND YOU'RE AMAZING IN BED IT'S OUR ANNIVERSARY!
This is how I look when I'm turned on!
Really?! How come?
How do you know about this?
Oh, this is fun.
Oh, okay. Feel better, Rachel, 'kay?
I'm kind, caring, and sweet. What's Monica like?
All right. All right! If he wants a date? He's gonna get a date. All right, I'm gonna go in.
Oh, this is it. This what's gonna kill me.
Great, all right, okay, and Monica ask me to make the drumming stop.
No, no, it's not that. Uhm... Remember when you asked me if I was seeing someone and I said no? Well, uhm... I am. His ... his name is Mike.
Mike Hannigan... will you marry me?
You don't have to lie anymore, Ross, I know that it was a fourteen year-old girl.
I have new respect for Chandler. All right everybody! It's time to open the presents!
Hey! Ooh, how was your first day working at the restaurant?
Oh!
I found you in my bed! How'd you whined up there? You are a mystery! Little black curly hair! Little black curly hair! Little black, little black, little black, little black, little black curly hair............
Oof...
That wouldn't stand in the way of a true pianist.
So, now, Rach, this is a traditional English trifle, isn't it?
Y'know Rach, I think that, I think you should be Monica's made of honor.
Oh. Okay. Oo, sorry I acted like a bank.
It's not a blue screen... it's just, maybe it was just really clear that day. OK, I have to talk to my grandmother.
Y'know she might not even notice he's gone.
Umm, Chandler, Monica, this is Don.
Oh, I know! "Oh...I slept with Billy Joel". All right, who hasn't?
Wait a second, or maybe you can go in first.
Okay, but.
Oh no! No-no! I understand the pain! Don't-don't hurt the puppy.
Well, if you really wanna know, I'm-Oh! I can't tell you this.
Well, can you dance at all?
Yeah, I should have told you.
Do you think they have yesterday's daily news?
Hey Mikey.
Who's Barney.
So what?! That doesn't give you the right to ditch me!
Uhuh. Because I'm a single mother, supporting my two children.
I-I-I like, I like parties.
Oh, hi Ross!
Look, I don't wanna talk about it. Okay?
Huh. Okay, Mr. Perkazet.
Oh my God! You're right! Go! Go tell Chandler! Hurry before it's too late! Wait no! Does this also mean putting out doesn't get you love?
OK honey, you're dating Ross.
Wow, a year and a half ago I didn't even know I had a brother, and now I have a sister too. Okay. Okay. Stop it, don't. So, I gotta get you a gift now. Is there anything you need?
Okay, whatever. Y'know what? I don't have time have time to convince you because he's only here for four hours, and I'm gonna go see him!
Really?
Umm, I lost one of your earrings. I'm sorry! I am so, so sorry!
This is fashion?! Okay, so to you, death is fashion?! That's really funny. Here's Phoebe umm, sporting uh, y'know, cutting edge hairy carcass from y'know, the steal traps of wintry Russia. I mean, you really thing this looks good? 'Cause I do.
Oh okay, well I'm sorry to bother you. Bye-bye. Yeah you're right, this is easy.
Oh, no-no, this place is totally healthy! That-this milk is mine. I bought this today, 'cause I was thirsty for milk, y'know. Okay, let's go!
Yeah, I think we are.
Ok, ok, she's taking the trash out so I can get you out of here but it has to be now, she'll be back any minute.
Well, I'm not sure. I mean, I guess until she y'know, gets used to the fact that there's y'know, a new mom. Y'know, I think she's worried that y'know, she's gonna, she's gonna be replaced. Well, that's not gonna happen is it? Noo. Okay, I have to return a call in the other room.
They're gonna get through this, aren't they?
Here he is.
Um, that's it. No. Hey! You! J. Crew guy. Yeah. Why have you been following me? I mean, all week long everywhere I look there's you.
Because this one is now! And-and it's two of our best friends! Who knows what you're gonna marry!
Joey!
Oh, it's so great to see you feeling like this!
Well, no no, you have to stay back. I, I have the pox.
Yes.
Ah-ha! A classic sign of love, the hug!
I sang. Hah!
Oh you are so lucky.
Oh no! That really is nothing, she is very sexually aggressive.
See? This is exactly why you shouldn't lie!
Ohh, I think she knows where my Dad is.
So you guys, I'm doing all new material tonight. I have twelve new songs about my mother's suicide, and one about a snowman.
It's not that bad.
Yeah?
You're just so mean to each other! And I don't want to end up like that with Rachel. I still like you!
David, I'm so sorry, I'm sorry.
Janice.
Hey, does Monica know about her broken plates yet?
Yeah?
Shhhhhh! I'm swamped right now.
Ahh, toilet seat covers! Is that what you were doing while I was getting gas?
Good! Good! I was just testing you.
No it isn't, this is my dad, alright, I'll show you.
I have quarters!
Yeah. Not looking for dates.
Ohh, they're having a great time with their Aunt Phoebe! Aunt Rachel hasn't been helpful at all. So, do you miss me?
Well, I'm watching it for some friends who went out of town. Wait. Hello, my name is Clunkers. May I please stay with you nice people?
Yeah that was lucrative! Smart like your brother!
Why don't you hire him as an actor? You could have him dress up and put on little skits. Whatever you want.
It's not cooler.
Yeah!
So is it like art?
I'm sooo sorry!! I just... I keep thinking about Mike! I'm crazy about David, and we're having so much fun together. Why-Why do I miss Mike? That's-that's gonna go away, right?
Yeah, I just don't buy it.
Well, I told you I had to spend all the day clearing out stuff, so Mike could move in.
Guys, I'm happy too.
Well, I don't care, so you pick!
I'm going to let him.
Oh.Okay, then it gets worse, 'cause then I told him that I would see him tomorrow night.
But they shouldn't happen, you know what, you're, you're in a terrible, terrible business. Oh God, I don't wanna be the person who makes your face look like that.
Joey, I just think you're getting worked up over nothing. This is probably just a crush.
But somehow you came off as the bad guy.
I'm sorry too...
Why??
Okay! Okay! Okay!
Ewww!
Hey.
Whoa-whoa-whoa, you guys, do you know anything about chicks?
Yeah!
Well, then you should come tonight. You know, just hang out with them. Let them see what a great guy you still are.
Fun Bobby is so great.
For how long?
You smoked!
...like a...
Hey, have you seen Frank Jr., 'cause he's meeting me here with the triplets.
Wooo!! Hoo!!
Alright, so, what, he's not a famous tree surgeon? And then, I guess, OK, he doesn't live in a hut in Burma where there's no phones?
Yeah.
Relax, it's not like we're forking.
That's true. Well, is anything you told me about yourself true?
So? Did you get the annulment?
Ooh, three points. Both fine answers, but we were looking for leafy, leafy.
Oh, God!
Um, yeah sure. Why you wanna call your Mom?
So you're gonna move?
Jason?
Well I'm sorry, I thought you said it was okay.
Okay. I have just a few questions to ask so I'm going to get out my official forms. Okay, so, question 1) You and uh, you were married to Francis' daughter Lilly, is that correct?
But I don't. Me, Phoebe.
Oh.
Oh, how does it work?
Oh Chandler!
That's easy! You just have to think of him as a-as a jar of pickles that won't open.
Ok, then maybe it'll be, uhm...
Oh no, Bonnie's the best!
Your knuckles are kinda hairy too...
Oh, we're just... we're sad to go so we're just saying goodbye to the hotel. I love you... Paradise Hotel, Golf resort and Spa...
Hey.
Uhm, actually no. No, you've... You have to get off the plane.
Maybe on some level.
"No time for losers, 'cause we are the champions of the world...!" Thank you!
Oh that tart... floozy... giant...
Come on. It doesn't taste bad.
No, y'know what don't close it 'cause the... keys...are in there.
Stay.
No! Why?
Oh.
But why does it even matter?!
Yeah! So you're gonna call this one back?
So do you want to hang out or something?
I won! I won! I finally won!
No, wait, oh, what are we sorry about?
Oh hi Ben-No!! Don't look at the machine!
Hey, Joey. What's going on?
Come on Ross. We're sorry. Please tell us what it is.
Wow! You really go all out when you're expecting company.
About 20 minutes. CLOSING CREDITS
There he goes, your fiance.
Chandler sucks! He couldn't have gotten this good!
Yes!! Ohh.
That's it. Just relax.
Hey, buddy. How's my favorite dog, huh? How's my favorite dog? You're subdued. Did you give him a beer?
Eww, look. Ugly Naked Guy lit a bunch of candles.
Oh please, you are not gonna ditch again like you did with London.
Okay then.
What does the sign say?
Hi! And you're going into what grade?
