Yeah, it is.
Wow! Umm, y'know, I-I would really love to, but I-I shouldn't.
Oh, really, really? Well, it wasn't very good for me either.
Well yeah, but I mean, it was good scared though, you know? Like when I-moved-to-New-York scared. Or uhm, when I-found-out-I-was-gonna-have-Emma scared... But this is... fine. This is gonna be good.
What? Wh-hey!
I'm fourth! Look at you with your little maple syrup award!
Oh, come on! You think that's gonna work on me?! I invented that!
Chandler, what did she say?
Just tell Joey that you watched the tape and you liked it, but your bosses didn't. Then that way, you're the good guy and they're the bad guys.
Hey! Hey, you guys, I finished the crossword all by myself! Hug me!
Okay, I thought it was about your neighbors liking you.
Ross, I swear, I don't know.
Ohh.
Well, my eye is a little itchy.
That's weird.
I wouldn't know what I'm gonna do without you...
They sent me home from work. They were like, "Start your maternity leave now! Just rest, get ready for the baby." Well y'know what? Screw 'em! If they don't want me there, I'll just hang out with you guys.
Oh I know, my God, this is so-this rice is so-I am so good.
Yeah...
Oh, ah nothin'. I just felt like hangin' out here and reading.
Thank you! And now if you'll excuse me, I have to go to the rest room.
Umm, well let's see uh, this one is Tom Brokaw.
Oh, god.
Well, what'm I gonna do? What'm I gonna do?
Ooy.
Okay so listen I'm gonna go lay down.
Oh, God! Please, somebody say something.
Look Ross, if you're so freaked out, just get in the car!
Oh, it's a Macy's bag!
Oh! Emma, that's right! You're that many!
Get down?
No!
Yeah, sure. Umm...here.
Oh! Did you hear that?! My dad's proud of me! My dad's proud of me.
Yep. Oh, yeah, look you great. Oh yeah. Yeah, this looks great. Umm, so you like it?
Op.
Let's roll!
So umm, what time are you supposed to leave?
How are you?
Oh dear God.
Why would you even want to come Ross? You're a horrible skier.
Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, this is so stupid! I mean, I gave Barry up, right? I should be happy for them! I am, I'm happy for them.
No, no, trust, me, it's, it's, it's much better that I know. Uh, I just liked it better before it was better...
Okay. Just give us a second. Ross!
Hi.
Nice to meet you.
But you said that you liked him! I mean what happened?! Did ya just change your mind?!
Umm, can I use your bathroom?
Hi. Ohhh, you got my message.
Oh, Joey, it's so great to be back here. I gotta tell you, you're making it so easy on me and Emma.
You know what? There is a little part of me that really thought we were gonna win.
Wow, so why don't you go talk to him?
Hi!
I'll take all of your photos and put them into photo albums!
No. She's going to live with us for eight weeks.
You would do that? I never get picked!
Wow!
So are things with you and Joey any better?
Phoebe, your in pain, would you just go to the dentist, just go.
No need!! Problem solved, we are powering through .
Hey!
No Joe, no miracle.
I knew it! I knew it, ahh....
I-I-I of course, I have more responsibilities than that.
Phoebe, you were right. I should've never gone to London, and from now on you make all of my decisions for me.
Oh, yeah, sure. I mean, like in the case of this young woman, she has lost her clothes, so she rides naked on the horse, she's crying out, 'Where are they, where are they?'
Oh, no no no no no.
Petty...
Well that was umm...Okay.
Well, so, now, do you guys have a lot of big plans?
Oh my God! Was she old? Does she have a view?
You know what?
Oh, big glamour night. Me and Monica at Laundorama.
What the hell is that?
Okay.
Well of those things that you said in the interview, I mean if you believe any of them, I must not be a very good assistant. Y'know what? I am just gonna pack up my desk, and I will be gone by the end of the day! Well, I guess there's no use to me sticking around 'til the end of the day!
Oh tomorrow, oh I don't know. Um...
Noooooo!!
What? Wait a minute, I didn't pay, I thought you paid!
Ah, hah-hah-hah-ho, yeah, he wishes. Oh, I'm sorry, look at me. OK, Michael, let's talk about you.
I would-Sequoia?
Thank God. Food.
Oh. Oh, right.
Why? Who's not having. . . Are you and Julie not, are, are you and, are you and Julie not having sex?
Rachel...
Well now it's an empty bar.
Oh, well thank you for taking your tongue out of my sister's mouth long enough to tell me that.
What rumor?
No. No, you can't.
man sharks. I always knew there was something weird about that dude. But you promised to love him no matter what.
Yeah right.
It's impossible to find a good doctor. I mean, how do you know the good ones from the ones who are gonna push their penis against your knee?
Oh my God! You are giving this a lot of thought.
Oh my god, this is the worst date ever!
Hi!
Amy, that's what I was supposed to wear today, that's why I hung it on the door.
Okay, hold on real quick, hold on a second let me just uh, get a little more comfortable here. Wait, now wait a second, this isn't too revealing is it?
I will. Ross, come here.
Well, it would be easier to move just right across the hall. Wait a minute, unless you're thinking about Naked Wednesday's.
No! Not at all!
