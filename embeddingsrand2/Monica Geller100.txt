Okay, now we just need something borrowed!
How dirty do you think I am? I'm telling you, if you had some candles and some bubbles and some music, you would love it! It would take all of your stress away.
Wow, that's a big cable bill! Huh, you don't have a job, but you have no problem ordering porn... on a Saturday afternoon?! I was in the house!
I don't know, my hand feels weird. I guess it's because, I'm engaged! How long before it starts getting annoying?
They won't be ready for weeks.
Nah, while you're at Ross's if you see any lying around...
Okay.
What are you doing?! Chandler! You can't just go back a phase!
Hey, the man's dog just died.
That was me.
Yes it has! I made cookies!
Ohh, I'm such an idiot. I can't believe I actually thought she could change.
Oh my God, he's gonna do it now. Please, I cannot watch this, let's go.
Well, what happened?
Mmh... this cake is amazing!
Hey, check me out, I'm a slut!
Tea gives Phoebe the trots.
Hello? Hold on. It's your boss.
No.
Y'know what, I've got to walk out of here right now, 'cause getting over you is the hardest thing that I have ever had to do. I don't think I could do it again.
Anybody tell you?
Alright. Just keep him away from me.
Oh, god... She's told you that already, didn't she?!
Uh!
Yes, we are.
Hi!
: do you know how many times I've seen him jump up like that, believe me I know what he was doing.
Ok, it's 2100 hours. Time for your toast.
No, give me the...
Oh, really? So why was I busting my ass to make this delicious Thanksgiving dinner?
If you're not going then I don't want to go either.
Why not?
Yeah!
You were just being so nice to him!
Ohh, I'm sorry I couldn't think of anymore for Ross!
They're all Chandler.
What kind of karate is that?
Are you nuts?! We've got George Stephanopoulos' pizza!
Am I on fire today or what?! Those birds are browned, basted, and ready to be carved!
Okay, well, stop staring at them.
Ross!!!
I need a few more things to make the margaritas. Uhh, I need some salt, some margarita mix, and tequila.
What was that bam?
Yeah, but I'm the only one related by blood.
What do you mean?
I don't think so.
Isn't this great?
There's nothing to tell! He's just some guy I work with!
Okay! Okay! Okay! We'll see you in about 3 to 4 hours.
Yes you did! You did like a little hop.
Oh my God!
Our guy's a great dancer!
What if I have babies, okay? I mean I'm gonna look different. I'm okay with that, but I'm not sure that you are!
Ow!!
Damn it!
What?!
No! Umm well, some people say that Oysters are an aphrodisiac.
What are you doing?!
Would you look at her? She is so peaceful.
And it could be soon. I mean, think about it: right now, somewhere out there our baby could be being conceived.
You're jealous of Princess Caroline?
She did WHAT?
No, you cannot.
Well, maybe you should send him something. So that when he gets to Las Vegas he'll know that you're sorry.
Of course we will, come on we gotta make dinner.
When did I sign for it?
Maybe, do you need a tissue?
Maybe we should just tell your parents first.
I'm sorry, I'll give it back to you.
You've got to be smooth about it.
Oh.
Hi!
Yeah! Roses or Lilies?
Just...please tell him.
Oh, I fell asleep.
You what?
Because Armadillos also wandered in the desert?
She's a hooker! She's a hooker! She's a... Hi! Uh, we spoke on the phone.
Only if you say his full name.
You don't need a shower.
What!?
In one year?! My God what did she eat? Her-her family! That's not the point.
You better believe he's tired, after the day we had! If you know what I mean. You know what I mean?
No, here's your mail.
How about if I dance around all covered in sauce? Huh? You think it's funny now?
Now, most guys will hit uh, 1-2-3 and then go to 7 and set up camp.
Ross you know that tonight is your date with Hillary?
Are you sure you wanna do this?
No, although now that's what I'm thinking.
Hi! Umm, I'm Monica Geller, I'm the chef at Alessandro's.
Alright.
Thunder being stolen!!
Oh my God! What were you doing in a library?
Oh. So nice of her to pull my hair, 'till I dropped the key!
It's.. It's just so pretty and white.
Well, Rachel wants to take swing dance lessons. Which I think is a really stupid idea! It's dangerous, she's never gonna get what she wants, and who knows who she might end up hurting.
Oh my God. Phoebe. Don't look now, but behind us is a guy who has the potential to break our hearts and plunge us into a pit of depression.
Like I remember his office number! Speed dial 7.
Okay, forget the specials for a minute. Umm, all right here's the thing, for the last two weeks I have umm, tried really hard to create a positive atmosphere...
Oh, then bring it on! Oh, unless of course your afraid you might lose to a bunch of girls.
