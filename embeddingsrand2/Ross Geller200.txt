Oh, no! No!
Yeah, I mean, if you moved there, you have to leave here. I mean, how can you leave this place?
Hey!
Oh, I don't know, they seem to have a shared interest in each other's tonsils...
Yes, that's what I have. It's not on the board.
Oh, I'm sorry, no. He did ask me one. Uhm... How do you spell Mboscodictiosaur?
That's impossible, he's got a twinkie in the city.
Wow, it really is!
I want you to tell her everything. About the deal you tried to make with me, about the crazy questions you... Wally Cox! That's the voice of Underdog!
We were drunk! I would've married uh, Joey with that amount of alcohol!
So what're you saying here? I should shave again, pick up some wine, what?
Okay, is everybody clear? We're gonna pick it up...and move it. Now all we need is teamwork, okay? We're gonna lift the car...and slide it out. Lift and slide!
Oh yeah!
Then I'm happy too.
Oh, Pheebs, I'm sorry, Ive got to go. Ive got Lamaze class.
Joey, some people don't like that.
Y'know if we ever go to war and you're captured, you're in for a big surprise.
Oh, really!
Y'know I would it's just painful.
Look sweetie, I could be the bigger man, I could be the biggest man, I could be a big, huge, giant man, and it still wouldn't make any difference, except that I could pick your Father up and say 'Like me! Like me tiny doctor!'
It's still a gift! I got it from the gift shop!
Mi-mi-mii.
What's-what's going on?
That uh, that was pretty funny. Wasn't it?
No! No! No! The "Come here to me" is y'know for the ladies.
You're excited, right?
Okay, there's this guy, Warren, from the museum and he's going on a dig for like two years and he's got this great place he needs to sublet. So uh, you interested?
I tired attacking two women, did not work.
Well, if Phoebe's choosing, then say hello to Mike's next groomsman.
Mmm-Hmm.
Okay! All clear!
What. Oh no, you just rolled over the juice box.
Well that I can believe.
Well, I called over there and it turns out Ugly Naked Guy is subletting it himself and he's already had like a hundred applicants.
Oh! Y'know, I've got an extra futon.
Uh-huh.
Right!
How'd the callback go?
Well, Kathy gets half-naked and simulates sex with a real good lookin' guy.
Well you're gonna be a wonderful grandma.
That's a different issue. Uh, the point is, when the baby comes I will be there to...to feed her and bathe her and change her. And more than that I want to do all those things.
Monica's pregnant!
Yeah, well, m-maybe you're right.
You know, Barracuda was the first song I learned to play on the keyboard.
That ring? When my grandmother first came to this country, that ring and the clothes on her back were all she had with her.
I-I heard about Mrs. Verhoeven passing away and I'm so sorry for your loss.
WHAT THAT'S A REAL NAME!
What should I wear, now I'm all nervous.
Fascinating.
Yeah?
Fine. You'll-you'll watch it on video when we get back.
Not like this!
E-except, except that what?
Oh, wake up!
So what, we just sit?
Sure. I'll help you.
So this is your office?
Apparently she fell in the shower and hit her head.
And on your anniversary, for shame!
All the time?
Well, the doctor says he's gonna be fine, he's just sleeping now.
What?
What-what-what the-how da-how did-what the-how did-what?!
Yeah, okay, hold on! They're not coming on man.
Hey, Missy...
Y'know of-officer I uh...I had the weirdest dream last night...
Hello.
I'm-I'm Ross by the way.
Great! Uh, let me take this up for you.
So, you gettin' tired?
Come on!
It is. Eventually, it kind of... burns out. But hopefully, what you're left with is trust, and security, and... well, in the case of my ex-wife, lesbianism. So, you know, for all of those people who miss out on that passion... thing, there's all that other good stuff.
All right, I'll see you tonight.
Could ya just, could ya just lay off, please? All right? My life is an embarrassment! I should go live under somebody's stairs!
Ezel? Ezel? Ezel?
Chandler, what kind of an idiot do you take me for?
Oh. This was amazing.
Do you remember the Ludwins? The big one had a thing for you, didn't she?
Ooh. What is the name of Chandler's father's Las Vegas all-male burlesque?
Oh that's nice.
Well hey! What's going on? Ooh, cool boat--Oh, no. Hey, did you, did you tell them?
Mom, y'know what? I-I can't deal with this right now. I'm sorry...
I'm here. How's my little boy? Want Daddy to change your diaper? So, did you have fun with Uncle Joey and Uncle Chandler today?
Nice to see you again Dr. Green.
Married couples send out cards, families send out cards, people who have been dating for a couple of months do not send out cards! What-what is she crazy?!
No, no, no, I'm sure you have a great excuse, wh-was it a hair appointment, a mani-pedi or was there a sale at Barney's?
Your what?
No-o-o! No way!
So umm, any word from Susan?
I guess when you don't have so many distractions, it's easier for you to focus. Huh?
Uh...Mona just dumped me.
Well, OK, I uh, I have to. I can't deal with this right now. I mean, I've uh, y'know, I've got a cab, I've got a girlfriend, I'm... I'm gonna go get a cat.
No. You're just gonna have to accept the fact that you're just friends now, OK, you're not... rommmates anymore.
But, you, you don't want to seem too pushy.
We know!
Yeah, not as much as you used to love to play uncooked batter eater.
Hey, I might!
Wait-wait, so, you get to be my best man twice and I never get to be yours at all?
...is for me not to see you anymore.
You got me.
All right, try pedaling.
She hates Pottery Barn?!!
I Know!
That's right! He was hitting on her, and I got her. I guess the better man won. Please don't take her from me.
Excellent!
Hmm.
I just can't see Chandler cheating!
Ugh.
What?
What are you guys doing?
Will the owner of a 1995 Buick LeSabre please see the front desk? Your car is about to be towed.
Well hello! I'm Ross!
Great. Great.
Don't say that.
Well, hello, Mrs. Ross!
Try sixty-five million years ago, and then try sssshhhhhh.... My tenure review board met today and I hear it's looking really good.
Hey.
What? What?
No.
My friend Bethel rescued him from some lab.
Yeah... I guess. I don'tI don't know. Alright, just... just give her this for me, OK?
Well, oh just ah, I was just wondering, when you and I split up, did you get the tape that was half the last episode of M*A*S*H and half the hostages coming home?
Oh, thanks Gunther. STUPID BRITISH SNACK FOOD!!!!!!!
Joey, what did you think a nubbin was?
It tastes like feet!
Hey! Everyone.
I'm an eight!
All right.
C'mon, what's his name?
Free cats do that too, y'know. {Which reminds me, if I might get a little political here, support your local animal shelter. Pet shops are not the place to buy dogs and cats from, you get a much better deal from the shelter, plus they probably won't die on you in a week and a half. If you want a leash, go to the pet shop. If you want the dog for that leash, go to the shelter and save it's life. Now back to regularly scheduled programming.}
Hi, we're visitiing. It's Ben and his da-da. Da-da. Can you say da-da? Look, I'm gonna tell your momies you said it anyway so you might as well try.
Joey, the guy's your best friend.
Oh my God!
I think it means he freaked out and left!
Nothing! What do you say to that?
What, the word hi?
Yeah, uh... and then I figured after you win, we could all go out to the balcony and see a night rainbow with gremlins dancing on top of it!
No they don't!!! Well they should put it in huge black letters!!!!
The actress!
Oh yeah! So ah, kinda pretty, pretty good. He sounds like a nice, good guy.
We had such a great time! She's-she's incredible! I thought the-the age difference might be a problem, but it wasn't. It wasn't at all. Elizabeth is very mature for her age. A concept lost on some people!
Oh man.
No.
Hey umm, was-was Monica here?
Oh. Thanks. Uh, has anyone seen Rach?
.....Hi.
Yes, it was horrible. She cried. I cried. She threw things, they hit me. Anyway, I did the right thing.
So, uh, why did you have to turn it down?
Muriel. Wh-why would he call you Muriel? Oh my God! Chandler M Bing? It's not just an M, your middle name is Muriel!!
Oh, I know. Y'know what, I never would've gotten this if it weren't for you. No really, when I'm with you I'm-I'm like this whole other guy, I love that guy! I mean, I love you too, a lot, but that guy! I-I love that guy!
You know, if I didn't already have a job, I think, I would have been really good in advertising.
Over my dead body!
Really? That okay, that's great.
Alright, now, you sure? Phoebe just threw away two jacks because they didn't look happy...
Here we come, walkin' down thethis doesn't smell like Mom's.
You were incredible! Brand new woman, ladies and gentlemen.
Ohh! Thank you! I like mail.
That's okay, I mean it was just two-week thing anyway, I just didn't want it to end this way, y'know?
Well then we'd be in a lot of trouble, you don't know where any countries are. Okay. Uh, say would you umm... Would you mind checking again to see if any umm, private rooms may have opened up?
Eh-wh-Excuse me?
Hey listen I uh, talked to Chandler, sorry about the movie.
Well, ??? think that's us?
Oh, I wish I knew, but the evaluations are all anonymous.
Yeah. Look if-if she's gonna end up with somebody else, the truth is she couldn't find a better guy. So...
So that's two of my wives.
No.
Look, I'm sorry but you-you-you better go Pheebs.
Oh! I thought you guys got married in uh, January?
Just, just say what you feel.
What guys? Oh, yeah.
You did! Oh.... I always figured you just thought I was Monica's geeky older brother.
I don't know. Soap?
I just wanted to thank you again for last night, what a great party! And the guys from work had a blast. Y'know, one of them had never been to a bachelor party before. Yeah! And-and another one had never been to a party before, so...
Same difference.
Hey, where's uh, where's mom?
Okay umm, why don't we all take a seat, y'know? And uh, and I'll get us all some uh some coffees--Yeah, why don't you. Uh and you guys can talk about whatever, whatever you want. Y'know? Whatever pops into your head.
Uh... Oh hey, do you, uh ...do you have any, um, Cinnamon Fruit Toasties?
Uh, do you wanna go change first? The doctor's keeping the office open late for us, but if you hurry...
Good-good, I'm-I'm married.
What do I know? I just sell Middle Eastern food from a cart!
I'm dead?
Oh, it looks like mom and dad's house. Oh, it even has a tree with a broken limb out front and the uh, the window in the attic is...Oh my God!!
Yay!
Excuse me, I'm seizing. Mr. Treeger, here's another 50, happy Hanukkah. Will uh, will this help with the knob getting?
Yeah.
Okay, so I'm gonna be the only one standing there alone when the ball drops?
'Kay, wait a minute, are you sure she didn't say "When are you gonna grow up and realise I am your mom?"
No, you didn't!
Well, I don't know, it's-it's kinda in a place that's not... It's not visually accessible to me, and I was hoping maybe you guys could-could help me out.
well he seemed to bum hard that you'd never been in a serious relationship.
I'm having a boy! I-I'm having a boy!
Hey, you'll never guess what just happened... Phoebe and I got mugged!
My baby sister, ladies and gentlemen.
Yep!
Fine, y'know what, that's it. From now on, Joey, I want you to be my best man.
DANGER!!! DANGER!!!!!
What?
I know! I know! Why do you guys need to have this conversation?! Huh? I mean no self-respecting man would ask a woman, "So, where is this going?"
Will you hold Ben for a sec? Come here. Come here.
Chandler!!! Chandler!!! Chandler, I saw what you were doing through the window! Chandler, I saw what you were doing to my sister! Now get out here!
