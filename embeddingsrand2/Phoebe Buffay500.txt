I hate this. 'Cause I tell you, I had the most amazing two weeks planned for us, and almost everything I had in mind, we had to be a lot closer than this.
Jason?
Ooh! We have a problem.
Not yet. Umm, I heard they really hurt, do they hurt?
Yeah?
What about this?
Duh, I think I know how to heat breast milk. Ok.
Good for you!
Oh! Oop!
Half full of looooovvvvve.
Okay.
No, no, because, you know, he's been in Minsk for 8 years and if he gets too much direct sunlight, he'll die.
Yeah?
No.
Oh, that's fine, no.
Ok well, before you do, I know we weren't supposed to get you going away presents, but I do have something for you.
I don't know. I don't know. I can't lie to him again. Oh no I-no! I'm just gonna press my breasts up against him.
Hi!
But you were going to propose?
Yeah, I feel great. 'Cause we're moving in together.
Okay.
Oh, interesting you should call me that! Now that I may never have one!
Theodore... Bitsy... What a delight!
Joey, I just think you're getting worked up over nothing. This is probably just a crush.
Okay. Hey, can you send somebody up and down 76 and check every rest stop, and, and also 93? Okay! Yeah, no they don't do that.
Okay. So, this wire is connected to this wire which plugs into here. Okay so, to get the beeping to stop all I have to do... Well done, Pheebs. What do you want from me?!!!!!!!
Hey!
For 99 cents, I'd eat you. Okay, I can totally settle down here. It's got everything I could ever want, including Joey! Look! Oh! Look! Hi!
Greg and Jenny?
Oh, yeah try that. So, is that better?
That would be great. Thank you.
And you know, I have a massage client soon.
He was a lawyer!
Right.
God, what a mess.
Ok, all right.
My God! What did you order?!
Wow, Mike Hannigan...You sure know how to make a girl say "Hell yeah!"
No I-I meant your costume.
What?
I don't know.
Hey, you guys! Look what I found! Look at this! That's my Mom's writing! Look.
No, you are not, you are very attractive. You know what, I go through the exact same thing. Every time I put on a little weight, I start questioning everyting.
Nothing, I'm sorry, I'm just, I'm out of sorts.
Look kibbles, bits. Oh God, alright, get the hell off my leg you yippity piece of crap. Ok, alright, we have a problem.
Okay, well I think that they're in my purse. Why don't you go get dressed and I'll look for them.
Ah-ha! A classic sign of love, the hug!
All right, there are no questions in the happy place. Okay, just, the warm breeze, and the moonlight flowing through the trees....
Wait! Oh wait! Oh no!
Marcia and Chester are mad at Phyllis.
Well, I don't care, so you pick!
No, but you can't.
I know. But don't you think that it should be called Order and Law?
Anything I can do to help?
Yeah. Ok, you don't have to believe me but um, can you think of any unfinished business she might have had, like any reason she'd be hanging around?
Mmmm hmmm.

Yeah I know, it was my candle. My candle!
Woo-Hoo! The curse is broken! I called everybody I know, and everyone is alive.
Oh no, let her stay out there. It's sweet.
Yeah that's great! Next to that, Chandler won't look so stupid.
Somebody went to college. Wow. What is it? I'm sorry.
Hey!
Rachel Karen Green, where's the other earring?!
Bye Chandler! I miss you already.
Hey!
That is so you!
Oh my God, are you guys okay?
It's so weird seeing Ross and Rachel with a baby. It's just so grown up.
Okay, ask her 'What is her current method of birth control?'
Besides, it might be kinda fun to form the new A-Team.
Why don't you play with your roommate?
17 years ago.
But they shouldn't happen, you know what, you're, you're in a terrible, terrible business. Oh God, I don't wanna be the person who makes your face look like that.
Monica, do you want us to take you home?
Oh my God! Oh my God, we are 31.
Huh. So now, the real question is, who put those fossils there, and why?
Well did she know you two weren't married?
Really?
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
Well, then tell him to stop staring!
Vince is a fireman.
Ross, Rachel doesn't know that you wanna get back together. If she did, she might feel differently. She might not even go.
Will he know what this is in reference to? And he has your number? All right, I'll see that he gets the message. Bye bye.
Save it Red! Unless you wanna spend the night in the slammer, you apologize to the tree.
How about we talk about this over dinner?
Hi Ginger.
Oh, I'm sorry. But I really like this guy. And I think he really happens to like me.
I think on my shoulder.
What's up? Tell Monica I'm sorry. Tell her yourself!
Okay. 'Jingle bitch screwed me over! Go to hell jingle whore! Go to hell Go to hell. Go to hell-hell-hell.' That's all I have so far.
Yeah!
Hey Joey.
Where'd you get too? We lost you after you opened up all the presents.
Kyle's ex-wife? You were supposed to divert her not date her!
No!!
About what?
You know what Amanda said to me when she got me on the phone? "Oh, so sorry to catch you on your Mo-Bile!" If-if you don't wanna get me on my mo-Bile, don't call me on my mo-Bile!"
Absolutely! Y'know, you get this rush of feelings, but then it goes away.
So what were you doing out there, do you not like Charlie?
OK Joey, your bet.
I just, I just have this really strong feeling that this cat is my Mother.
Grandma's gonna have to get in line.
Ursula's fiance?
Are you kidding. He is so considerate of my feelings and... you know I think... you'd also like to know that he is a very gentle lover.
Well then I think that's it.
That's right, there you go! Crushes happen all the time! I know I've had them for all you guys. Well, except for Ross and Chandler. And I'm sure you've had them for us.
Oh! I'm a masseuse. I give people massages and stuff.
And-and a power tie?
Oh.
Hey Mike, what's the capital of Peru?
You tired Chandler?
I'll give you $1 for them.
But, it's not like we're losing anything. Y'know?
Ross, you're being ridiculous! Okay? You are cute and smart and sweet and that is much more important than three stupid divorces!
Oh, he-he can't talk right now.
Ohh!! Ohh!! And I love you!
Hey!
Ooh, is it someone in this building? Is it that tall guy from the first floor?
You know, it's so surprising that you and Joey have known each other for so long and I've never heard about you.
Okay. All right, this is my favourite part of the weekend, right now, this.
These old things.
Oh my God Monica!
Huh?
Um, the matador. Ole, ha ha ha.
Yeah.
Sooo, what's goin' on, huh?
Sorry Jill.
Hi.
We just have to really, really, really, not let stuff like money get--is that a hickey?
So now what do we do?
"Pick up grandma at the airport"?
You mean whenever Monica and Chandler where like y'know doing laundry or going grocery shopping or-Oh! All that time Monica spent on the phone with sad Linda from camp!
I can't believe you tried to move the green ottoman.
Oh, we were just trying to make Joey feel better.
No, it's not! We were just goofing around and I dared him to try them on.
Well then, what about you?! Huh?!
Ewwww!!
Yes.
Okay.
Rachel, didn't have anything that I liked, so, but she had this Christmas ribbon, and I thought, 'All right, fine I'll be political.'
Hey!
Fine, all right, mine had a dwarf that got broke in half, but y'know whatever.
Right.
Ok, it's very faint, but I can still sense him in the building. Go into the light, Mr. Heckles!
OK, now I'm gonna kick some ass.
Yeah?
Why are you being weird?
Okay, I know. Hold on. Hey Ross?
Calm down. Maybe you're not pregnant.
C'mon Mike, you can beat her! Knock that dog off her head!
We didn't fool around with any of them. Dwha! Dwha!
Ok, ok, she's taking the trash out so I can get you out of here but it has to be now, she'll be back any minute.
Oh no, Rach, no no, you know you're never supposed to wake a sleeping baby.
Shut it down.
What?!
OK. Ooh, OK, you gotta give me a second, I wanna get this just right. Dude, 11 o'clock, totally hot babe checkin' you out. That was really good, I think I'm ready for my penis now.
Don't make me do this again, I don't like my voice like this.
Oh! What what what! ...Hi.
Hey!
Oh thank you.
Oh.
He is! But he's getting divorced-Ross! Maybe you know him.
No no no, I'll be nice, I swear!!! Could you just give me the number for where they are?
That is so great! Oh, I... Oh my God!
Hey!
You heard her too?! You have the gift!
Ow!!!
Monica, I really appreciate you checking in on me, but I'm actually feeling a lot better. Yeah, I just kinda want to be alone right now.
No! Barry and Mindy.
Yes.
I am extremely talented!
Uma Thurman.
That's what you think.
I'm not gonna right to you! That's not real!
She was a drug dealer!
Okay, okay, okay, okay... Still sure about me being myself?
Thanks!
Yeah!
Ooh.
I can see that, 'cause they both have those big brown eyes and, ya know, the little pouty chin.
All right, all right, so up until '92-93 he was very trusting, then '94 hit, Carol left him and bamn! Paranoid city!
Well, so, umm, anyway umm, I've been, I've been looking for my Father, and umm, have you heard from him, or seen him?
So okay what? You're gonna be married to a girl who doesn't even know about it?!-Op, woman! Sorry.
I'm kind, caring, and sweet. What's Monica like?
Well, y'know I'm wearing layers and it's warm.
Hi!
Oh my god, I'm gonna be on TV!
Me too! Monica, do you think we could do it?
I'm sorry.
Y'know what? We thought you were different. But I guess it was just the coma.
I know where Minsk is.
Yay!! Oh so, you're not, you're not mad at us anymore?
What's the matter? Why so scrunchy?
Y'know, you are 12 years older than her.
Yeah, okay, listen, umm, Mom, I hope you know you still mean a lot to me. And you're welcome to come back anytime.
What do you mean, comforted her?
I just wish they'd realise they should be together.
Huh. Okay, Mr. Perkazet.
Hey!
Oh really?
'Cause my, my grandmother's never had chicken pox. Please, please tell me you have, 'cause oh my God, I forgot how cute you are.
Hey!
Hey...
Yeah, did she sound happy about it? 'Cause my friend Ethel's baby was born with a teeny, tiny beard.
I can't! My circuits are fried! They're fried I tell you!!
Please!
Come on. It doesn't taste bad.
Rachel said that!
Wow! Hello, Mr. Chandler.
Hi!
Have umm, have you thought anymore about you and Rachel?
It's too soon to tell. She's resting, which is a good sign.
Oh good, oh Joey and Chandler are back.
How are you? Good. Hi, thanks for coming.
Hey. Ooh, look at you, dressy-dress.
It's not all mine. We all get 50 cents.
Oh yeah, like there are police for that!
Good.
None the less.
Hey Rach, what time do you get off? We're all gonna do something tonight.
I, I don't know what to say. I mean, you know, you're married to someone for six years and you think you know him and then one day says, 'Oh, I'm not gay.'
I know, I know, we can drive, we can vote, we can work, what more do these broads want?
Okay. Bye!
You're the best. Thanks. Oh!
Who dies?
You're gonna be okay?
Ah!
Come on, do it.
Who the hell are all these people?
Yes, we should. I think we should.
Yeah? And, he's-he's so centered and mature and confident.
That's fair! Thank you so much. Thanks. Oops, it looks like when he got the pastry chef he got you a little bit too.
Get your garlic-peelers off me!
Fun Bobby is so great.
Ooh, this is it! Oh, that's him! That's him!
No wonder your pregnant.
Well, that could've been really awkward.
Yeah, okay, I've-I've been dating both of you, and it's been really horrible. 'Cause y'know it's been a lot of fun, for me. Umm, but I-I like you both, and I, and I didn't know how to chose, so... I'm sorry, I'm just, I'm terrible, I'm a terrible person. I'm terrible.
Oh, you guys! We've got to keep all the tickets together.
Hang in there, Man With Eye Patch, your tray is coming!
Hi.
Umm, I'm a masseuse...by day.
Maybe we have the flight-number wrong. God.
I don't know what to do with that.
No, okay, you're right. You're easy-going. You're just not as easy-going as Rachel. She's just more flexible and-and mellow. That's all.
Ohh! Oh my. Oh, that reminds me, I have to see my OB-GYN today.
Well okay but I have two tickets to the ballroom dance finals.
Well, he wants to do some ecclectic, so he's looking for someone who can, you know, create the entire menu.
Well I guess it's okay to open one more if it's part of a set. Y'know, it's probably this one.
That's great. Good for you guys.
I know, I want that too, but IS that going to make it too hard?
Yes that's right. But still, I-, look at your purse, look at your sweater, look at yourselves.
Alright, wait, so what you're saying is that the chef is at the Hamilton Club, but the food is not and the drinks are there, but the bartender is not? Are you, are you FREAKING KIDDING ME!?
Uh-huh!
Does a dog's lips move when he reads? Okay, no they don't.
Ewwww!!
You're pregnant!
What?
Well, who cares what your Mom thinks? So you pulled a Monica.
No, no, no, I actually it's any baby animals: kittens, fish babies... You know... especially veal... and this, this nice vein of fat running through it... Hmmm... yummy Hmmm...
Well, no no, you have to stay back. I, I have the pox.
Yeah, I locked him years ago!
Yeah, he's gotta go.
Hey.
Rachel?
Who's Barney.
Well, he made a move on me.
What?!
Hello. My name is Regina Phalange. I'm a businesswoman in town on business. Would you like to see my card? Ooh, what did I do with my file-a-facts? I must've left it in conference room B.
But Monica, he loves his job so much! Can you just give him another chance? Please?
Yeah, it's beautiful.
Oh yeah, oh and I know, but this isn't what it looks like, 'cause Rick is my ahh, husband.
Would you relax? I know what I am doing. This is how he wears it.
Oh, hi.
He said, "Nice to meet you Glenda." Well, obviously I couldn't give him my real name?
Oooh! You are a very bad man!
Oh, I knew something had to be wrong, because my fingernails did not grow at all yesterday.
Hi!
Yeah, you're right. This is none of our business.
And... moment's over! So, ok, uh, I can forget that. I can forget that and uhm... Oh this is funny! Oh, but you need to know that to... that, to... Oh, ok, well, uhm, I . Ok, ok, I, ok, I.... MONICA I CAN'T DO IT LIKE THIS! THIS IS MY WEDDING! OKAY, I DON'T WANT THIS OR THIS OR THIS OK? I JUST WANTED A SIMPLE WEDDING! WHERE MY FIANCEE CAN GO TO THE BATHROOM ANYTIME HE WANTS! You know what? You're done.
Um, the off-Broadway play people said 'You were pretty but dumb.'
When I was you! Y'know what, it's all Joey's fault, 'cause he left his nose open!
Oh, thank you! Oh... Oh my God, you're RICH!
Remembered what?
I don't have to tell you everything!
I know, they're gonna be so happy together.
Now, we can kick anybody's ass!
Okay. Would you rather live in the shirt pocket of a sweaty giant, or inside his shower drain?
What's going on?
Oh, no! I- I can't drink this now!
Ok, um, hi, hello, hi, ok, so, um, this is a song about a love triangle between three people that I made up. Um, it's called, um, "Two of Them Kissed Last Night".
Nothing, I really wanna know.
Yes, 'cause now I have to go down there, and deal with them.
Yeah, I think I told it wrong. Y'know, we should talk about that because I don't totally understand what happened there.
What about her whining and her constant need for attention?!
It's okay. How's the soup?
Oh, good, good, you guys are here! Listen, how would like to spend tomorrow taking care of three incredibly cute little puppies?!
Yeah, is there a hair on it?
Yeah! But I'm a little shaky and nervous.
I do! I do! I do! I do! Ugh, like I can really chase you. I'm carrying a litter.
Well look, if I wanted to see a fireman, I would date one. Okay?
All right, me too. Should we wake her up?
And! She uses sex as a weapon!
I would love it. Consider it forgotten... But just so you know... however and whenever you decide to propose, I promise I'll say yes. Whether... whether, you know, it is in a basketball game, or in sky writing, or you know, like some lame guy in a cheesy movie who hides it in the cake.
A-Allright, well... I'll call the cab company.
You guuuyys.
But, but this is my gig. This is where I play. My, my name is written out there in chalk. You know, you can't just erase chalk.
Hey!
We know about your party Joey.
Rach, you're in my seat.
Do you wanna get to Rachel in time?
Okay! I just-I didn't know that you are a lesbian.
So... now... What about with Mike's mom?
Yeah, um, which ones in particular were great for you?
Oh, there they are!
What?
Monica.
Yes! You know, in six months the Statute of Limitations runs out and I can travel internationally again!
Hey!
Okay. And, my, dead, mother, says, you, are, it. I'm with Rachel.
Oh yeah, that's right, the keyboards, huh?
Ok. What are you gonna be doing today?
Now wasn't Joey hitting on her at the wedding too?
I'm sorry, I broke down... I wanted to see him.
Okay, then what happened?
Are you asking me to have a frenaissance?
Um, yeah sure. Why you wanna call your Mom?
HEY! Mike called were going out again! YAY! YAY!
Gauze! Gauze! I need to get some gauze in here! Can I please get some gauze in here! Whew! This is getting ridiculous uh!
Uh-huh. Good luck.
Well isn't he your friend? Don't you want him to be happy?
I hate my regular clothes now! Y'know? I look down and-and I know that this isn't gonna be the most special day of my life.
No.
Oh!
And, and!
Earl, you're not hearing me! All I'm saying is that you're not alone all right? Everybody hates the people they work with!
No that made me feel precious.
Yeah.
You guys!
Or you could stick a fork in an apple!
Okay, it's okay.
Ohhh, wow.
Okay, stop tormenting me! This mink! Okay, they're mean! And they hate squirrels! And y'know, okay, most of these probably wanted to be coats! All right, fine, now I get it. Here. You take it. Are you happy now? I'm cold!
Uh-huh, and a little seed money for the party.
Oh no, yeah.
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. If you... If you want your key back, I totally understand.
I-I-I like, I like parties.
And Tim I just wanna say, good luck here.
Can you believe this? We were waiting for a hot guy and then an even hotter one shows up!
Don't be so corny Ross, it's not an after-school special.
Why?
We won!
Maybe they don't trust us.
You'd already broken up.
All right, let's see, call me mrs Hannigan.
Yeah. Oh, can I come?
How about just the bridemaids?
I've never been more convinced of your love for her.
He says, that he would cremate my fur coat for free if I umm, y'know, bring in the next person I know who dies.
Well then get your money back and return them!
Oh, my.
Ohh! I have! I have! I started making these little sock bunnies! Oh for crying out loud!
Huh?
Oh that'd be me. Sir. After you.
'Cause it's good money! But that doesn't change the fact that this is an evil blood sucking corporate machine!
Hi.
No, it's just that he got this new like home theater dealie, and he wants y'know, us to check it out.
Yeah.
But really, it does seem like this money could be put to better use?
Well, okay, I made a touchdown. It was my first touchdown. So?
To Ross.
Still, he had to find out sometime.
Joey, you can't make someone do something they don't want to do. Believe me, there's something I've been trying to get Mike to do in bed and there's... he's just...
Better.
Umm, not without you, lover. So, this is my bra.
You keep the old ones in the back, that is so ageist.
Just kidding!
Hey Rach, you wanna get some coffee?
Ah! Oh my God! You r-r-rotten boys!
God, I hope they kick his ass!
And that horrible museum tour!
But, let's play this one first. And remember whoever talks first loses!
Oh, I wish I could, but I don't want to.
Mon... Marcia and Chester are planning on seeing a movie on Sunday night. Marcia thinks they're supposed to meet at six, Chester thinks it's at seven.
Oooh! I have something you can do! I have this new massage client... Steve? Anyway, he's opening up a restaurant and he's looking for a head chef.
Who are you kidding? You just find some guy off the street for me? Oh God! This is humiliating!
Oh no no.
Oh God, I'm so glad you guys are happy, I was so afraid you were going to be all freaked.
Look, I'm talking right now! You're-you mean her.
No, no, it's not that. Uhm... Remember when you asked me if I was seeing someone and I said no? Well, uhm... I am. His ... his name is Mike.
Ok. Um, so does your guitar have a strap?
Okay. It's exactly how I'd imagined it would be.
Sorry, mix up. Hey, how was the movie?
Umm, it's negative.
Oh no wait, oh no, the elastic on my underwear busted.
Hi. I just had the worst anniversary ever.
Ahh.
I can do that.
I'm gonna find a selfless good dead. I'm gonna beat you, you evil genius.
No. I'm-I'm to depressed to talk.
Well, if you don't know I can't help you.
Excuse me. Umm, is Vince here?
Allison's birthday party.
Wow!
Oh some guy from my gym. A little annoying.
Why is Ross doing that?
No, it's fate!
Alright, I can get you out.
Oh...Joey, you bummed him out! This was the happiest dog in the world, and he spends half a day with you, and look at him!
If!
I thought you said you read it in high school.
Maybe your resolution is to not make fun of your friends, especially the ones who may soon be flying you to Europe for free on their own plane.
Good!
Yeah!
Oh, but I can't do that-
All right, you know Paolo?
Like what?
I'm done now.
Yeah, say my name. Say it! And now I'm going to cover you back up, and umm we're never doing this again.
Rachel? Oh, good. Hey, by the way, did you just get on the plane?
He's holding us back.
Ooh, God it looks bad.
Oh good, I didn't miss the party.
I'm sorry, for the last time, why aren't you two together again? No, I know. I know, because you're not in that place. Which would be fine, except you totally are.
Yeah. But Sergei said it took the Germans six weeks to get all the way across it.
Taffy, really? I've never had any.
I've found....
Another lie. You have a sickness!
Get over here!
Thanks.
Well, I said, I told him y'know, that I was the executor person of Francis' will and that I needed to talk to him so I'm gonna meet him at the coffee house later.
So, what are we gonna do? Are we just gonna go ahead and set them up with people?
No!
Oh yeah?
Y'know! You don't make a very good first impression.
I never had a bike of my own.
That is so sweet. But don't you think it's a little too soon? I mean there's so much we don't know about each other.
Well, I'm watching it for some friends who went out of town. Wait. Hello, my name is Clunkers. May I please stay with you nice people?
Hey, are Ross and Rachel back?
No Chandler, they can swallow one of those little parts! And also, look at his smooth area, that's just gonna mess them up.
Ah, Catwoman. So we meet again.
A little. Now you're talking.
Alright, could I just ask you one question?
You see? Nothing is good enough for her!
I have liver damage. Ow! Oh!
She died.
I cannot believe I can't find a selfless good deed! Y'know that old guy that lives next to me? Well, I snuck over there and-and raked up all the leaves on his front stoop. But he caught me and force-fed me cider and cookies. Then I felt wonderful. That old jackass!
Anyway, I should go. Okay, bye.
Ooh, if you take the northern route there's a man in Illinois with a beard of bees. {Okay, I must protest this, I've lived in Illinois all my life and know of no man with a beard of bees! Wisconsin, on the other hand, might be a different story.}
No I didn't!
Oh my God, they took my idea!
That is funny.
Insane.
Sure! Yeah! Las Vegas, number one!
Ooooh, nice.
Listen if you wanna go, just go.
Give it!
Look Eric, turn around. Look, I like you, but it shouldn't be this hard. Y'know? This is our first date y'know? First dates are supposed to be about excitement and electricity and 'Ooh, he just touched my hand, did he mean to touch my hand?' and y'know first kisses and......second kisses.
But what about all the "finding-his-flaws" stuff we've been doing?
Phoe-Be.
Chandler.
Monica, you might want to remember that you are married. Where is Chandler anyway?
Um, oh, I've got a birthday party, with some work people.
Well I'm sorry, I thought you said it was okay.
WHO DID YOU SEE HIM WITH?
Monica, I'm sorry I didn't come by last night. I was out with Gary; he let me ride around with him in his cop car. We saw and prevented crimes.
So Ross, how umm, how did it go with Bonnie?
Hey.
so you don't think I'm a total freak.
Oh my god, Rachel asked me if I knew anyone for her too.
It's just y'know, been a couple of hours, and she hasn't called. Not that I even care, y'know.
Hey, y'know what might cheer you up?
Hi Gram. Whatcha doin'?
Yeah I guess, a little.
Sure! What?
No look, we've apologized twice! I can't do anymore than that. I know you hate it when people are mad at you but you just have to be okay with it.
Well, umm, not much. But, I was just thinking that since those guys just got engaged that maybe it would be nice if they had some privacy, y'know? So, could I just move in with you for a couple days?
Okay, listen Robert...
I guess so, can I. can I think it's cool that you kiss me and also wanna kiss you again and umm, be a little concerned about the magic markers.
Hey, how was class?
Oh I know.
I feel like my face is swelling. Is my face swelling?
Still going through that dry spell with Carol?
m'ap.
Oh! No, I-I think I just had a contraction.
Umm, is-is that because you're out of toner?
Didn't you sleep together?
Oh, I'm sorry. Is that annoying? And speaking about being selfish in bed, how's Whitney?
Uh-huh! I'm so...happy.
God, I woke the beast. Sorry. I was wrong obviously, I just-I misspoke. It's okay.
I'm in vice. Yeah, in fact I'm undercover right now. I'm a whore.
