Eww!
All right! Let's get this over with! Ugh! Ohhh! No! Look what I did! Oh, I mean, look at this mess! I mean, we're probably gonna have to clean this up! Y'know? We're gonna have to reschedule!
I am so sick of guys. I don't want to look at another guy, I don't want to think about another guy, I don't even want to be near another guy.
Oh honey, I'm so proud of you, Min.
Yeah. Oh! Was how you invented the cotton gin?!
What, so you go over there, you tell him you think he's cute, what's the worst that could happen?
Phoebe, come on can we finish this later? Cause I wanna go running before it gets dark. Oh! Why don't you come with me?!
What?
What?
No honey, it's okay! Listen, I'll got to Ross's and get the blender, you get all the margarita stuff ready.
That's right, still no baby! Come on people! Please make some room!
I'll say.
Well that was umm...Okay.
Yeah?
Oh, you are the lesser of two evils!
Oh my God you're amazing! Did you just pull that out of her purse?
Okay, but Ross, eventually you and I are gonna be dating.
Ross, honey, is there anything we can do?
I know. Days of Our Lives, thank you very much.
Oh God Monica hi! Thank God! I just went to your building and you weren't there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are, you are!
But I haven't used my card in weeks!
Well, well um, you know, these movies are offensive and uh, degrading to women and females. And uh, and the lighting's always unflattering. And, Monica help me out here.
Oh oh no just stopped to throw up a little bit. Oh come on, what am I gonna do, its been hours and it won't stop crying.
You have a son!
Oh! Tommy, this is Ross. Ross, Tommy.
Ben, its Rachel! But whatever.
What did you just say?
Basically, there's the thing, and then there's the stuff after the thing.
Ross!
Shh.. Go back to sleep. I have to go home.
All right, okay. Alright, let's give to these babies something to cry about!
Monica!
No, I mean with us, you know. I mean, is it supposed to be this... difficult?
Hi! Emma will be up in a minute!
No no no no.
This is just occurring to you?
Oh, I think I saw some in here.
Hi.
Or...I could call in sick and not deal with it at all...
No.
I loved the moment when you first saw the giant dog shadow all over the park.
Remember when we were in high school together?
Okay. Honey, I would love for you to go with me. What?
Okay. Hi Emma. Well, your first birthday is over, and it was really...
Well, okay, look. I don't know, listen, I don't know what's going on here but let's...
Okay. Hey. Umm. Does everybody hate these shoes?
"...marenge, thank you honey, and do the cha-cha. And while she like to be a star, Tony always tended bar. At the, wait, wait, everybody.."
Oh, God, oh, God, I mean it's just so.
Nothing! Oh God, we're just so excited that you want to get this apartment!
Ooh, the gift shop!
Alright, I don't wanna alarm anybody, but Monica's hair is twice as big as it was when we landed!
What a jerk! You want me to kick his ass?
Get out!
My drinking?
Even so, I think I'm gonna pick Ross.
It's worse than the thumb!
Oh god. Oh, am I being like a total laundry spaz? I mean, am I supposed to use like one machine for shirts and another machine for pants?
Oh, c'mon, Luisa!
I can't go to my own prom without a date, I can't, it's too late.
Well, h-how is this like that?
Virgo?
Really?
Ohh, I love Joey! Joey lives with a duck!
That's fine. So Monica, you are now in control of my love life.
Hey!
Oh, I'm sorry, were you speaking to me or sleeping with someone else?
What's up?
Oh, hi!
Joey, you can't let him get away with that. Ya know what, I'm not going to let him get away with that. I'm going to say something to him-No, I really shouldn't say anything-No, I should say something to him. Gunther, I want you to give Joey his job back. That is really not fair that you have to fire him...
And you are so in style right now. Y'know, I work at Ralph Lauren and the whole fall line has got this like equestrian theme going on. I don't suppose you saw the cover of British Vogue, but...
Hey, don't listen to them. I think it's sexy.
Oh. Oh my God, is that Phoebe?
Whoa-whoa, there's two living rooms? God, growing up here, this place must've been a real babe magnet.
Look Joey, I'm sorry if-if you thought that was mean, but I gotta tell ya something. That was not mean. Okay, my father is mean. He used to yell at me all the time on the boat, I mean it was horrible. I was just being a good teacher.
What?
I meant, me plus one!
Phoebe no!
Oh yeah, she can't be herself.
I'm really, really not.
I'm not jealous. All right this is about, umm, people feeling certain things y'know about strippers. And y'know, and um, I...
Oh, okay, we're going. Yeah.
Well, we're not seeing each other, so....
Okay, don't listen to him. Please?
Say more things like that.
Look, y'know I know my life's going pretty well, but I look around and I just see so many people who've accomplished so many other goals by the time they're thirty.
Yeah, sure...
C'mon touch it.
Tell him.
So, how are you?
Alright, c'mon! Let's play Twister!
Did uh, Ross call?
Uh well, uh this is a silent auction. They lay out all the stuff here and then you write down your offer and then the highest bid gets it.
Yeah.
Hey!
Oh no, I know I couldn't see it either at first, but it's right umm... Ross, I lost it again.
Oh, ooh, everything looks delicious. What should I ha-ave? What should I have?
They had to reduce it because of, of my deviated septum.
Really?
Thank you.
Well, you know, honey, I don't think everybody gets Smelly Cat. You know, I mean, if all you've ever actually had are healthy pets, then, whoosh!
No.
Because it's Richard's son! It's like inviting Greek tragedy over for dinner!
No....
Hey Mon!
Okay, okay, okay, I got one! Anyway- The valentine Tommy Rollerson left in your locker was really from me.
What if she jumped out the bassinet?
Yeah.
There's more alcohol, right?
Okay, uh...
Oh yeah. Right. So now, are-do you, do you still do music?
Oh, well, you know, they're just separated so, you know, never know, we'll see.
Nothing.
Do you even know what a vicar is?
Okay.
No, we never do that
I just don't want him to meet anybody until I am over my crush-And I will get over it. It's-it's not like I love him, it's just physical! But-I mean I get crushes like this all the time! I mean hell, I had a crush on you when I first met ya!
Hey, I was doin' great before I found out about you. You think it's easy for me to see you with Julie?
Oh, I probably shouldn't-so I will! Oh! Wow! It's like it's raining!
Oh, I'm sorry, I guess I just bring it out in him.
High-five, the babies are coming!
Oh they are nice. We-we custom-make tuxedos for celebrities and then when they're done with them they just send 'em back.
I'm just kidding too. I'm getting married in December.
Joey! Come on! I don't wanna make any mistakes, alright? This is the only dessert and if I screw it up everybody's gonna be like "Oh, remember that Thanksgiving when Rachel screwed up the trifle?"
What? I-I don't.
Well neither do I!
I'm sorry. Oh God, I'm sorry, it's just that when you moved your hands down to my butt, it was like woah, Ross's hands are on my butt. Sorry.
Yeah. Uh-huh, I guess it is pretty big news.
Oh Daddy, no he didn't mean anything by that, he really didn't.
There you go!
What did, what did he say?
What? They were like this!
Yes, I'll meet 'em.
Y'know...
Yes, you did-Oh my God you didn't! Well then why didn't you tell me that before?!
Oh!!
That's right. You're very cheeky for a temp.
And while I'm gone don't you boys sneak a taste.
Okay! Y'know what? I realized it was stupid to get upset about not having a husband and kids. All I really needed was a plan. See I wanna have three kids...
Yeah, you know, was I looking forward to going to Paris? Sure. You know, was I excited about working in the fashion capital of the world? Ooh, absolutely... Oh...! Yeah, but you know, this is... it's fine. I'm fine going back to a job where I've pretty much gotten everything out of that I possibly can...
Oh what do you know? Virgin!
Yeah but y'know what they say Mon, "There's no such thing as bad press."
Oh Mon, listen I have to ask! Okay, Joey Tribbiani invited me back to his apartment, now does he do this with a lot of girls?
What-what?! You're gonna leave this person with me?!
Okay. Wow! So I get to see what Joey Tribbiani is like on a date. So do you have any moves?
And I-I am just trying to figure out why.
You seem to really like her.
I'm so sorry.
Hey!
You're out of Diet Coke.
Oh wait, Ross, would you just stay and help me get dressed?
