Hey!
Y'know, if you listen closely, you can hear a thousand retailers scream.
Y'know when I said that because we're getting married that we should share everything and not have any secrets?
Excuse me? You don't think I could get a Brian? Because I could get a Brian. Believe you me. ...I'm really not.
Okay. Good one.
Okay, look, I'm gonna have to ask you all to leave.
Oh no-no-no, you-yeah, of course you get to be my best man.
Don't worry.
You know, I - I think you're set with the poultry.
Don't think of it as a cigarette. Think of it as the thing that's been missing from your hand. When you're holding it, you feel right. You feel complete.
I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name. Paul, was it?
Monica, could you excuse us for a second? I need to talk to the girl with the flowers.
Hey! I will have you know that... aah, who am I kidding. Let's call the kid Geller and let Bing die with me.
To the left, to the left- aww!
Hey.
Ross came in forth and cried!
That's ok.
I'm not even getting married! Okay, this is a question for science fiction writers!
Its not just that shes cute, okay. Its just that... shes really really cute.
What about all that "friends forever" stuff?
Hey, whoa-whoa! What's she like?
Dog grooming huh? Okay, just don't make my tail too poofy.
Let me ask you, do you have to be Carol's lesbian life partner?
Off?!!
No, the thing was, we were gonna go see Hootie and the Blowfish.
Hey, I'm going for sushi does anybody want.. Whoa-whoa, somebody missed the off ramp.
Here!
Okay, okay-okay, ah, Chloe works with that guy Issac. Issac's sister is Jasmine. And Jasmine works at that message place with Phoebe. And Phoebe's friends with Rachel. And that's the trail, I did it!
Yes, and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a child's pillow.
Yeah, Jell-o just like Mom used to make.
What 'not work out'? I'm seeing her again on Thursday. Didn't you listen to the story?
I Understand who would cancel an actual date to go to a fake bachelor party?
I'm going crazy! Okay? Do you have any thing around here that looks homemade?
You mean like, music?
Question. If I don't care about my watch, can I use it as a weapon?
I'm sorry, I got a little occupied.
You don't think I get up when you get up?
I understand.
Hey!
Why!?
H-He's in China!
No-no-no-no-no!
Yeah! You wanna come?
Your computer, I don't know wha... everything's gone!
One of life's great, unanswerable questions. I mean, who knows? Maybe there's something even more painful than those things? Like this.
How do you know?
Not yet.
Hey, gorgeous.
Plus I thought the baby would be in good hands with a doctor!
I know..
Yeah, why not. So I told her.
Okay!
Takin' that with you, huh?
Yeah that was great. That was really great! But to tell you the truth, I'm more excited about where we are right now.
I'm full, and yet I know if I stop eating this, I'll regret it.
So, are you really gonna go out with that nurse man?
What...? That's not you! Life is good again! Ride 'em cowgirl!
So I got ya something.
Oh hey Rachel, sweetheart? You have got to tell the post office that you have moved. Okay? We are still getting all your bills and stuff.
Oh no, you'll have to come.
Yeah, Karen. I'm thinking about having an affair with her. Oh, you know what? I just did.
Let's.
Hey!
Oh!
Oh, the duck seems to think that Monica got me garbage! Hmm, I wonder what I could get Monica that's as good as garbage?
Look, she's not backing down! She went like this!
Okay, but this is the last time. With a chick-chick here, and a chick-chick there. Here a chick, there a chick, everywhere a chick-chick--chickeeeen.
I see.
That's true!
Oh, is that against the rules?
What does a guy have to do to be taken seriously around here?!
Ah, Sliced Bread, a wonderful Lady MacBeth.
Y'know sometimes the good ideas are just right in front of you, aren't they?
Hey, that monkey's got a Ross on its ass!
Hey!
Helen drinks. Will you marry me?
Yeah.
Is that Joey? Is that Joey? Let me talk to him! I wanna talk to him!
Oh come on! Are you listening to this?
No-no-no! I am the king of bad Thanksgivings. You can't just swoop in here with your bad marriage and take that away from me.
7:15. Watch doesn't work.
What?
Yeah, he's really excited about it too, he even recorded show times on his answering machine.
I'm sorry, we're just kinda excited because we finally have a couple to hang out with.
Oh my God!
Eh, they're both good. I generally just go with, Monica's drunk again.
Yeah.
I cannot believe you didn't pick me.
Well see now that I can see crying over, but Bambi is a cartoon!
And you left the toilet seat up, you bastard.
Hey, how was your breakfast with Hillary?
I know. You're right. What's it gonna take for you to forgive me?
Really?!
You got it! Here we go! Come on! This is great! Ahhh!
This coming from the man who couldn't split our 80 dollar phone bill in half.
Go change! She doesn't want her parents to know she's drunk.
Oh, come on Monica, reliving past pain and getting depressed is what Thanksgiving is all about. Y'know, for me anyway. And of course, the Indians.
Well it wouldn't kill you to say it once in a while.
Okay, absolutely!
Nope, hymn 253, His Eyes Are On The Sparrow! When my parents got divorced is when I started using humour as a defence mechanism.
Where I don't want to have a relationship ever! I just want to have sex with strippers and my friends!!
Condoms, dude!
Good luck.
And you... Ross, I believe, if you check Rachel's bag you will find a half-eaten box of cookies in there.
I can't believe you came back.
Those are book ends! That's a great gift!
Why did I get married?!
Boy did we make friends with the wrong sister!
Oh I'm so sorry man! Is there anything I can do?
Yeah, we're gonna go.
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm trppd in an ATM vstbl wth Jll Gdcr.
Thanks!
Okay.
'Cause he was just so darn cute.
Oh yeah!
So, what are you doing here? I thought tonight was your big anniversary dinner.
I think it's best sir.
No way! If anything you've gotta let me win! My wife thinks I'm a wimp!
What're you kidding? I broke up with her. She actually thought that Sean Penn was the capital of Cambodia.
By then, the cheesecake may have gone bad. We don't want her to come back to bad cheesecake.
Hey, how'd it go? How'd she like the gift?
Well, you couldn't get them anyway. Ian doesn't plan anymore and Derrick... And Derrick is a name I shouldn't know.
Here.
Oh, I don't know.
Oh, well then, if anybody should have a party it should be him.
Yeah, we played, we watched TV.. that juggling thing is amazing.
I'm not macho.
Okay, here's the situation. The keys to the cuffs are on the back of the door. Could you be a doll and grab them and scoot on over and unlock me? And on a totally different subject, that is a lovely pantsuit.
Yes, it is.
Why not?
There's a Mr. Bing!
Ah, the "I'm sorry I rejected you" phone call. I'm not used to getting it from guys. Hey, Steve.
What a sweet story.
So Rachel's all moved out huh? How are you taking it?
Do not speak ill of the dead.
No, no. But let me show you what I can do. "Bagels and donuts. Round food for every mood."
Hey!
Yeah?
Well, it's a training program, but at the end, they hire the people they like.
Well, what if all my stuff was here?
That's patio furniture!
Yeah me too.
Yeah, so, what's that supposed to mean?!
No, no, no.
Hello, Janice.
No!
everything's great, just watching some regular television there, what a pleasant surprise.
Okay to come in?
That was amazing.
Uhh, you've had a lot of sex right?
Well, Kathy's last boyfriend was Joey.
Well, I think, I think, Ross already has one. Now, this one's free, right? Because you paid for the first two, so the third one's free.
I don't, and I'm offended by the insinuation!
Dude, don't rub my face in your crazy single life!
Honey, she keeps canceling on us, take the hint.
Hey!
Hey Caitlin! Somebody got a haircut.
Wow, in 45 minutes you can find her twice.
So ah, Joey tells me you two met in acting class.
Hi!
Okay I promise. I'll-I'll hate it. Wow! You-you look...hideous.
Oh, oh, a quality, good, because I was worried you guys were gonna be vague about this.
In the game room!
Yeah.
Let me ask you, why is everybody using these tiny lights nowadays? I remember when people used to use big lights.
Joe, I told you, you're just not right for the part.
Ahhhh-I'm not going to call you.
Oh, tell her good luck with that.
I don't know. That's the thing. I don't know what I want to do. I just know I'm not going to figure it out working there.
I shouldn't even bother coming up with a line, right?
Hi Ross.
What's wrong? What's wrong? You're married that's what's wrong.
You or me?
No, no, no-no-no. I smoked for years, then I quit. Right now, I can't remember why. You're not allowed to smoke in this office. Not right?
no I'm not quite sure you got the right movie that's all.
Well, I've got a girl in here.
Hey! Which one's my turkey burger?
No! You're the sweetest!
More importantly, was I any good?
No, it wasn't you.
But if we win, we get your apartment.
Hey, y'know, I have had it with you guys and your cancer and your emphysema and your heart disease. The bottom line is, smoking is cool, and you know it.
Maybe that's because she's a minion of the anti-Christ.
No, you're the best.
I'm sor... Just go. Just go. I can't, I can't.
You know what's weird. Donald Duck never wore pants. But whenever he's getting out of the shower, he always put a towel around his waist. I mean, what is that about?
Joey, if I go first, I wanna be looking for my keys.
Remember that big party? Freshman year? A week before Christmas vacation? I do. You had some visitors.
You totally screwed him over.
When you go lunching with hunky moustache men and don't tell me about it!
No way!
Oh, great. We have to watch him do yoga in his underwear, but for this he closes the drapes!
I think it's the dying cat parade.
Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas!
Hey!
I'm sorry, I won't be here.
It could've been worse, he could've shot her.
You don't, like go into the back of my closet, and look under my gym bag or anything?
Well, y'know, you and me, it had to end sometime.
No. Not anymore.
Some girl...!?
Oh! Look at that, time's up! My turn!
Yeah.
You went home with the waitress.
Yeah, come on, it's Ross and Rachel, they've got too.
Still terrified, I'll take care of it. No problem.
I invented the game of Cups as a way to give Joey money.
Janice was my safety net, ok? And now I have to get a snake.
Hey!
Yeah, I've been to these places before, but I've never really seen them, you know.
Monica's wasted.
Hey, y'know what? I was wrong.
We were playing Gin? Y'know if we were a couple, we could play this game naked.
What?
Okay.
Well, that can't be good!
Well, stuff like where we'd live, y'know? Like a small place outside the city, where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff. Y'know, we could have a cat that had a bell on its collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door. Of course, we'd have an apartment over the garage where Joey could grow old.
That's a good call. Right.
Yeah. We're doing the right thing, right?
I'll do it!
Ohh that's the worse thing that can happen on an anniversary ever!
What, what's what you mean?
Oh!
Hey!
Yes! I've-I've never seen a roll like this in my life!
Oh, by the way, that is her full name.
It is a crime that you and I don't spend more time together.
Okay, okay, here she comes! How do I look? Do I look like a guy who doesn't want to get married?
Okay, I have news. You don't have to move to Tulsa. You can stay here and keep your job.
I don't know. It's a bracelet.
I am totally picturing you with all those women!
Before!!
Okay, a quick one. Come on hug it out. Oh hey! There you go. Okay.
Are we in London?
Hi, I'm Chandler. Your live-in boy
Listen, I have to, uh, um, I have to, I have to confess something.
...and then it got canceled.
Be right there sweetums. A totally different situation.
Is it just me, or can you actually see his abs through his overcoat?!
Wow, in 45 minutes you can find her twice.
Can I finish my story?!
So where are you applying to?
Well yeah, but then...
Hi! How are you?
I don't see him. Do you see him?
No it's not. It's small. It's tiny. It's petite. It's wee.
Just tell her the truth! Tell her you're not ready.
You mean the spitter?
25J and K, any chance those aren't together?
Hey!
Hi honey I'm home.
Where you going, Joe?
Whoa-whoa-whoa!
Because the kids need new shoes.
Why would Monica be keeping Richard in here?
And if not, we got to do it on a bucket.
Oh, that's not true. You had an impact on me, I mean, it's 15 years later and we're still best friends. Doesn't that count for something?
Two.
Hey!
Shhh, busy beaming with pride.
Bad news. I watched the tape and passed it along to my bosses and they weren't interested.
Hey Pheebs, what's up?
I do NOT want this unit!!
Yeah, that's the same as "it has something to do with wind".
You're not actually supposed to stop on the bridge.
Okay, okay, a little announcement, I just want everyone to know that the position of my best man is still open! And uh, so is the position of the bride.
Listen er..I need to ask you a favor but you can't tell Monica anything about it.
Well, uh, Dr. Greene, where are you going?
What are you doing?
We're notwe're not saying anything.
Bad London!
Let me get this straight. I called yesterday trying to cancel my reservation and I was told it was not refundable, then we drove six hours all the way up here and now you tell me that we don't have a reservation?
I'll look forward to your call.
Hey!
Because I'm in love with Monica!!
No.
No!
You know what I just realized? We have no idea what we're doing in the wedding tomorrow.
Okay y'know what, because you said that, I'm not putting out tonight.
Ginger. I'm talking to Ginger, so....
Well where... Where did she go?
You know, I don't get this. A month ago, these people were my friends. You know, just because I'm in charge doesn't mean I'm a different person.
Well, how you died was funny.
So explain something to me here, uh, what kind of a relationship do you imagine us having if you already have a husband and a boyfriend?
Wait a minute! I have a date tomorrow night.
...And boogie!
Ross is smart and funny, d'you ever think that about him?
Hey babe.
Okay, now let's decide who has the nicest ass.
Call me!
So Dan, nurse not a doctor huh? Kinda girlie isn't it?
Ok. Ok. Having a phone has finally paid off.
Wait a minute, I can't give this to her.
Why can't I tell them that we live together?
Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no!!
All right. Very good.
Oh good, when he comes back for his keys, I'll be sure to give him your shoe.
You do?
Oh, And We Should Warn You, Before You Watch It don't watch it.
I'm never gonna find a roommate, ever.
Nope... Hey... so I'm gonna... put the plates back. You know, I think you were right, I don't think we should use these plates again for a looong time.
He thought you said gonad.
Who?
I'm not gonna watch it... I don't NEED to watch it... I mean, what good could possibly come from watching? Well, we know I'm gonna watch it.
Okay, here you go. I have two queens, what do you have?
I know. He has your eyes.
Yes, the doctors say if they remove it, he'll die.
I KNOW!!!
Oh my God, introduce us!
.
It is not okay that I'm aroused by this now.
See you later.
Yeah! Why don't you stick around. You can sit right there.
Hey!
Yes, I know, but her friend sounds like such a...
I got good. I played this game all day and now I rule at it! They should change the name of it to Ms. Chandler. Although I-I hope they don't.
It's seven years ago. My time machine works!
We're growing up.
You don't trust him?
Seriously sir, my brains? All over the wall.
You mean that Portuguese couple? Yeah, like you wouldn't have done it.
That was weird.
Yeah, we're gonna need to see that tape.
That's right! It was the wrong kind of eight, no wedding! Damnit!
Well why didn't you stop her?! Why didn't you just tell her it was a plan?!
Maybe I could give thanks by taking my Playstation over to my new apartment.
Much sense?!
Peter Parker.
Don't play with his things.
Oh, is it on the computer, cuz I'd love to give it a read...?
Did she look 16?
Hey, you said that without gagging!
Ready!
Oh-oi-ho, yeah!
Yeah, that's like the most ugliest dress I've ever seen. Wh-why do you to return it?
How... exactly are you pursuing that? Y'know other than sending out resumes like what, two years ago?
Well, you still havent taken down the Christmas lights.
Y'know Pheebs, it's kinda our anniversary.
Ye-e-es!!
Maybe, isn't she the woman who lives below you and has sex really loud?
Oh, I would never bet this apartment. It's too nice.
I think we may have really done it this time.
'So Cheesy' also has an opening.
Hey, you guys! Hey, Ross, quick question for ya. Are you ready to party?
And?
No-no-no-no, this is bad! It's bad! This is bad!
That's great.
Okay, good luck with that.
A freakish thin date with a hanger for her head?
You sure you don't wanna stick around a little longer?
Okay, one...two...
No-no, he's not back yet, but he'll be here any minute. So uh, come on in. Have a seat. Bow or stern?
Really?
Yeah?
Monica, there are no words... There are no words! This should not be this hard!
This is..shhh!
I don't think so.
Yeah, I think we should see other people.
I'm goin' home.
...He's in.
Can you believe how lame this is?
Yeah! It's a stupid job, and I could not stand leaving you. And why should I be the only one who doesn't get to do what he *really* wants to do?
Well, why don't we move this into the bedroom?
You know you don't want me to help. You can't have it both ways!
Kids, new dream... I'm in Las Vegas.
Not a lot of closet space, but he can just hang his stuff out the window in a bag!
Thank you Rachel.
You know, it haunts me? Up 'til now, the worst thing I ever saw, was my father doing tequila shots off the naked houseboy. After this, I would gladly make that my screensaver!
Y'know, I don't know why you're so embarrassed, they were very nice boobies.
No I didn't!
Yeah! yeah... The hard part is over!
Okay.
And I think Ross is generous too.
You can always spot someone who's never seen one of his plays before. Notice, no fear, no sense of impending doom...
...Quality, right, great.
Aww.
Wow! Just like in the pros.
Alright, OK, alright. But if we put on spandex and my boobs are bigger than yours, I'm goin' home.
Wait. Advertising! That's a great idea!
Oh-no, y'know with Gandolf we'd be out all night!
You know, once youre inside, you dont have to knock any more.
Oh. Oh right! Right! Because you're still seeing him and uh, he's a good guy. I mean, I remember a time when...
I'll tell you what, I will go get them developed and you can go home.
Nothing happened? Nothing? So you didn't tell my girlfriend that you love her?
Come on! Gary's such a great guy! Whatever the problem is, you can work it out!
We don't need to remedy that.
Hop on.
Okay. Okay. What are you gonna do to me if you get the part?
8. 8!
Robert's coming out.
What is the matter with you ?!?
Well now-now you're just talking crazy.
Hi.
You did look like an idiot.
Well, I have kissed over four women. Do you wanna get under the covers?
Oh, uh, that would be mine. See, I wrote a note to myself, and then I realised I didn't need it, so I balled it up and... ...now I wish I was dead.
Humiliating and noble!
Wait, if we're lucky, and we're really really really quiet, we may be able to hear the sound of a condom breaking!
What?! It's not right! We're not ready to have a kid now!!
Okay!
What are you doing?!
All right, look, look. What did... what did you get for Angela Delveccio for her birthday?
Look, maybe I got carried away before. But there's something you gotta know. If I'm the best, it's only because you've made me the best.
Hey, look at this! They're lighting the big Christmas tree tonight.
No. We were in the middle of sex...and you fell asleep.
Your Veal Chop is $34,95!
Ahh, come on! Y'know what-y'know what, I think I'm just gonna go home and call Kathy.
Bad dream?
But uh Ross, Ross is a great guy! I was roommates with him in college. Uh, funny story... You're roommate in college died didn't he?
That's correct.
The cameras? Remember last night I told you to take them?
Screw the Knicks!
I got nothing.
Okay, I don't think we can turn anymore!
David is going to propose to Phoebe tonight!
Those are all really old!
Well, we're really not that close. Okay, so I guess this is uh, good-bye then.
Okay, then get the lobster!
No-no
Poor Ross.
Yeah, I'm kinda wishing everyone wasn't here right now.
Happy plane-aversary.
Aww, man!
Okay, but now see you're crying!
Oh, that's Ross's.
No ah, hold on a second Joe, where do Dutch people come from?
Oh that's too bad.
Wow!
And what does she have to think about? I love her!
I don't know. But I-I-I know I love you!
Ya know, the man's got a point.
Great job with the cups, Pheebs!
Oh. Nope, that patch is no good.
As bad as that went I actually enjoyed myself. I think that I'm going to apologize for all of the stupid things I do.
Nice try.
Oh, Come on!
Mhum.
You got your passport?
Okay man.
Oh, yeah?
Well I think it's safe to say that our friendship is effectively ruined.
Our minister...
Okay, I thought of the joke two months ago at lunch with Steve.
No, I think we're just blurry shapes to him now.
I mean, You wouldn't want any part of me to get any bigger would you? Don't answer that.
It's a hand. It's a thing you use as a Jack and Coke holder.
Yes. Right where?
Uhl..ell. By the way, in case you missed that, that sound was, "Uhl, ell."
I think this is probably why Damone smokes in his cell alone.
Yeah, all right.
And we're changing.
No, if crazy plate lad.. If Monica dies then I would get Emma, Right?
Well, I see you've had a very productive day. Don't you think the cowboy hat is a little much?
Seriously dude, 3 years ago.
Seven times!
I broke up with her.
Why is Phoebe singing to Carl Mulden?
Again, what?!
So?!
Why?
No!
I don't know. I can't tell, what ever it was went back in too quickly.
Who are you going out with?
Oh, hey, when she gets here, is it ok if I introduce you two as "my wife" and "the woman who's carrying my child"? No? Divorce?
Yeah, fine. Fine. Not perfect!! But good enough.
Eh, yeah, well ah, waitress at a coffee shop and cheer squad co-captain only took up so much room.
No-no-no-no, I've supported you one hundred percent and I want to prove that to you in person!
Look, I thought about it too, and I'm sorry. I think we should spend all of the money on the wedding.
Double it!
You tricked me to get me into bed?
Oh-oh.
You still want that baby?
How was your date with Joey?
Is there a puppy here?
Oh, come on. What was with that whole Black Bart speech? : "When I play poker, I'm not a nice guy!"
No-no-no-no-no! You can't!
Ooh! Yes! Okay! Here's what we do, we-we forget it happened.
What's wrong with sun-dried tomatoes? On a barbecue chicken pizza? No?
Listen, I've got a secret for ya. I let him win.
I'm a little bit uncomfortable with the that way you express yourself.
The one that doesn't.
Uh, HELLO!!
Hey listen, come on, Joey is having a problem! A little girl is beating him up.
How long it took to go back in the water?
Hmm mmmhm..
All right, let me in.
Hey.
Shall I carve?
This is probably the wrong thing to be worrying about, but... you're getting ham on my only tie.
Hi.
Hey.
Well, actually just one birthday flan.
Well you did pull his hair.
Hey! Hold on a minute, hold on a second. Do you think these pearls are nice?
So, are we going in there?
Does that mean I get the good loving tonight?
You mean the guy who kept staring at your chest?
Shut-out!!
It's yelling...bleeding...dilating. Oh, the dilating...
Sounds like two people are really enjoying the Dewey decimal system.
You are so great! I love you!
Okay, well I won't uh, worry about this anymore then.
Oh uh, as it turns out, we can't do it. Monica has to work.
Oooh, Rich is goin' to the party too, huh?
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
No.
Ye-ye-yeah, yes I do!
Nina? Nina. Nina. Nina.
This is okay. We're all adults here; there's nothing to be ashamed of. Now, let's put our underwear in our pockets and walk out the door.
Oh Jeez honey, I thought, I thought you were asleep.
Because I'm very happy for him! And you, you lucky dog!
NO!!!
Yeah, I can be a hero, I could do that. I could, I could do... I, w-w-what if, what if it attacks me?
Yeah, yeah, she works over at that place, uh...
No!
I don't get it, I mean, you just got him. How can he be an adult already?
Well, couldn't we just lose our virginities again? Ya know, because I think actually mine's growing back.
Oh, no, no, no, don't go! I've scared ya'! I've said too much! I'm hopeless, and awkward, and desperate for love!! Hey, Janice! It's me. Um, yeah, I-I-I just wanna apologize in advance for having chased you down the street.
What? That's terrible!
You guys ready fore the movies?
I know you probably don't want to go out with me, y'know because I make too many jokes and I've never been in a serious relationship and I guess I'm not technically a "doctor..."
Woah, hey, yo.
I said it first, bro.
Yo!! Spackel boy! Get up!
Well, it's just the reason that I'm asking is because I kind of eh, uh, I was unable to-I mean I really wanted too, but I couldn't.... There huh-hmm, there-there was an incident.
Well, invisible kids can be that way sometimes.
Hey!
What equity investments?
That was a celebration of life. Alright, look, I'm not gonna do this. Alright, is this really the way you want a baby to be conceived?
Oh, I'm sorry, so 'we' is?
That's a good thing actually, because ah, he used to have me rehearse with him.
Erica wait!
On every word?
We already knew that!
Why must everybody watch me sleep? There'll be no more watching me sleep, no more watching.
Yeah, and someday when you're ready, you'll make it past the hedges.
That was an obvious joke, and I didn't think of it. Why didn't I think of it? The source of all my powers. Oh dear God, what have I done!
Happy New Year!
Hey!!
No! No-no-no-no-no-no. It sounds like they really need you down there.
It's not all juice!
Where did you, when did you, how did you... How did you get a girl like that?
You just said... Of course you're my best friend. Would you please tell Rachel though?
No-no! This is my fiancee and her heart was set on that ring. You don't want to break her heart now do you?
Ohh.
Hey, there he is! There he is!
How is that worse?!
Well, maybe you can get in on a beauty scholarship.
Pierce Brosnan?
What does yours say Pheebs?
Yes I'm gonna put it back exactly where I found it.
Okay, what do you saw I go over there and say how much I like her? No-no it'll be good, I can tell her much I've been thinking about her. That I haven't stopped thinking about her since the moment I met her. That I'm so fantastically, over-the-top, wanna-slit-my-own-throat in love with her, that for every minute of every hour of every day I can't believe my own damn bad luck that you met her first!!
Oh, just a bit of shopping. How've you been?
You can't wear that! I'm wearing the famous tux! James Bond's tux!
All right ladies, here's what we're gonna do. You are gonna take off my clothes. You two, go get the oils. And you just constantly scream at the top of your voice, "Chandler's the king! Chandler's the king!"
Oh, this is soo bad.
Oh that's not bad, Pheebs?
Yep...
You called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a Santa costume, so I borrowed one from a guy at work!
All right, that's it, give me your underwear.
Yeah, you almost overreacted to something.
...Hm.
This guy invented Moss 865! Every office in the world uses that program!
Would you please get some rest!
The cold weather hurts my hip!
There are snow cones! Snow cones! Yuck!
Again I must go back to, how?
You're messy.
Why not?
Okay.
When have I ever done that?!
Well I think it's safe to say that our friendship is effectively ruined.
Is that a real thing?
Um, is it sugarless?
Okay. Okay, now wait a minute that was totally different.
All right, if I do this, can we at least discuss sex on the balcony?
Oh, good job Joe.
Why not?
Because that's where Joey gave me some stuff to store that I've never seen before in my life! Okay, that did not just happen!
What's wrong with you?
You mean they like you.
Ladies, ladies, let's just compromise okay? Phoebe, Rachel take off Monica's bra.
Yeah, Monica doesn't like that either, Maybe I should stop doing that.
Actuary... no. Book-keeper... no. Topless dancer... Hey, d'you know what I just realized? You are the sole wage earner. *You* are the head of the household. I don't do anything - I'm a kept man!
No stupid jokes. I thought that was for the actual wedding.
Well I didn't think that was serious. Ya know I thought that was just a fight.
How about the closet by the bathroom?
Phoebe, I asked you to guard the ring!
At a fake game!!
Can you believe it? I mean, don't I seem like somebody who should be doing something really cool? You know, I just always pictured myself doing something...something.
Hey!
Okay, well tonight's the big night.
BE-LOW me!
Well, at least we got these little guys out.
I totally understand. Can I just see your bra?
Let's just say if I can't find the right CD case I just put it in the nearest one.
I can see why that's hard to resist.
Hey, you guys in the living room all know what you want to do. You know, you have goals. You have dreams. I don't have a dream.
What is the matter with you?
Nobody is opening anything ok? Look, I don't know about you guys, but I wanna see the look on Monica's face when I give her my present, and I'm sure she wants to see the look on my face when I get mine. So please, please, can we just, can we put them back?
Oh yeah, I totally agree.
No, no, you got zero points for 'IDNEY'.
Y'know what? I can't believe this! Do you know what you did? My girlfriend is out there thinking things over! You made my girlfriend think!!
I don't know. I can't--I just, I can't get her out of my head. Y'know? I mean, I'm a very bad person. I'm a very, very bad person. I'm a horrible person. No you're not Chandler! We still love you Chandler!
You're definitely scaring here.
Because, I-I should've called! Y'know if I had just called her after our big, stupid fight, she never would've gone out with Nick, and they would've ended up in bed together. I threw her at his man nipples!
Alright I'll tell you what, I'll play you for it.
Honey, I'm gonna save you some time, 200 CDs, not one of them in the right case.
Oh, he works in the Fine Foods division.
Y'know I had a big meal on Monday, y'know. So that's just gonna get me straight through the week.
Yeah, you don't want to be stuck with us for the next five weeks.
It can't happen like this. Okay? I'll meet you back at the hotel.
Yes, but I-I uh, don't have too.
Yes, every single one of them.
Yeah. Hey, here's an idea, why don't we use our wedding china today?
The wife says "Hi!".
Okay, if you see a little version of me in there? Kill it!
All right...
Alright you guys are off to party number one and you, you are off to party number two Alright fellas, let's keep it movin', let' keep it movin.
Really?
Guys, guys, guess who I am?!
The big deal is I was sitting there last, so, that's my seat.
I was surprised to see a kangaroo in a World War I epic.
No reason, except...she...told...me.
Well that would help the pride thing.
Well, I... I've got a pop-up book that told me everything I need to know.
Really?
A dinosaur died a million years ago?
I can't believe I did this! What an idiot!
Oh, that's ok.I'll just try and reschedule. "Hi, this is Chandler Bing. I made a reservation there and I need to change it Oh, what do you mean it's not refundable? Can I just come some other time? Oh, can't you make an exception?"
Oh honey, leave them alone, they're in love.
The reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make a big deal out of it.
Hey Ross.... bahhhh!
Hey! Phoebe! We can talk to Phoebe!!
I am mad! But you know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna forgive you! Because that's what friends do! They forgive their friends when they do everything you just said, all on the list there. Well, but I want you to remember that I forgave you.
All right. I'll tell you what. When we're 40, if neither one of us are married, what do you say you and I get together and have one?
So, you gotta play the odds, pick somebody who's gonna be in the country like all the time.
So, thanks for having me over! Rach. Pheebs.
That would be impossible to resist if you weren't all drippy here.
Hey-hey, is Monica here?
I don't have a *job*! *Closing Credits*
Shocking! Since you still have the keys.
So, let's go.
You know, I always feel that way after an interview. I'll bet it went better than you think.
It's your timer.
Yeah I even got a ring. Did you get a ring?
Oh yeah, I should probably call them.
Yeah, like there's any way I could ever do that.
What rule? There's no rule, if anything, you owe me a table!
I'm so glad we've got adjoining rooms!
I have a weird feeling about this place. How do I know that they are not gonna secretly videotape me and put it all over the internet.
I'm not seeing Monica.
We're not gonna talk about girth are we?
I'm only going to pretend I'm moving to Yemen, it's the only way I can get rid off her.
When did that happen to you?!
Some guy, Tom Gordon.
Are you judging them by their covers? Because you're really not supposed to do that.
Rachel, what is the deal with you and doctors, anyway? Was, like, your father a doctor?
Oh, man. In my next life, I'm coming back as a toilet brush.
Yes he did.
Hi, my name's Chandler. I just moved in next door and I was wondering if you would be interested in battling me in a post-apoplectic world for control of the galaxies last remaining energy source?
Well, y'know I'm 29. I mean who needs a savings account.
You got it.
I've had a very long, hard day.
Clunkers?! Oh my god!
Ah. Your own brand of vigilante justice.
I'm just saying that sometimes we like to do stuff that costs a little more.
Arghhhhhh!!
Sure!
Hey, y'know what we can do? Y'know, now that we are up? We can just like talk to each other all night long, y'know like we did when we were first going out. It'd be fun!
You know what, okay, fine. Don't get up, you just sit right there. I just hope, you don't mind, you know, my hand right here. Op, not touching, can't get mad! Not touching can't get mad! Not touching can't get mad!
Bye.
Ha-ha-ha--enh-enh. I'm so glad you guys are all here! My office finally got wrinkle free fax paper!
Look, I just wanted to apologize for last night. I got the feeling we made you a little uncomfortable.
What must it be like not to be crippled by fear and self-loathing.
Well, that's what we said about Joey...
Hit yourself in the tooth?
That's good! I liked it, they didn't. Joey, for God's sake, go to work! .
That's really not the kind of thing we are looking for Zack.
Hey!
I didn't get to the bathroom. I bumped into Owen on the way, and he didn't know he was adopted. And there's a slight chance I may have told him.
To my best bud. Thanks best bud.
Yeah!
Okay, look, Joey! Come on, think about it, first of all, he'll never be President. There's never gonna be a President Joey.
Y'know what, he's right. There's something like uh, ammonia in that, that like kills the pain.
And those guys were this close to lettin' us play this time too.
All right, buddy!
Oh yeah.
Hey, come on, give me a break, I'm out on a limb here.
Oh what's the matter? Are you scared?
'Cause I was sitting there.
Right. So, it'll be the same except... less sex with you.
Are you serious?
Mom. Thanks for wearing something.
I don't know... um, Grease?
Hi, Just Janice.
We think he was trying to spell out 'MONKEY.'
Oh, ok.
Joey's tailor...took advantage of me.
Yeah, I can say that I have a conference and you can say you have a chef thing.
Great novels?
Yes, if the foxhole was lined with sandwiches.
Hey! I'm sorry! That- where are you going?
Hey.
Why can't we talk in here? With, with, witnesses.
I just walked in the bathroom and saw Kathy naked! It was like torture!
Well I was... I was exactly expecting company after... 9:15.
I was not flirting.
What?
Freedom!
That is lucky.
Hey, come on, it's not your fault.
She's shhing me! It's my phone and she's shhing me!
No, you keep the pack. I'm all cried out today.
Oh, y'know what, that might be okay even if it was just kind of a fling, that might be all right with Rachel.
How long have we been home?
Oh, then no thanks. What the hell was that? Mental note: If Jill Goodacre offers you gum, you take it. If she offers you mangled animal carcass, you take it.
Well let's see, there was the guy with the ferrets, that's plural. The spitter. Oh-ho, and yes, the guy that enjoyed my name so much he felt the need to make a little noise every time he said it. Nice to meet you, Chandler Bing Bing! Great apartment Chandler Bing, Bing!
Hey, that's not good. Can I get an espresso and a latte over here, please?
Just out of curiosity did she tell you how you're gonna go?
I am sorry I am late. You'll understand when you'll see Joey.
Yes, and I get my ya-yas from Ikea. You have to put them together yourself, but they cost a little less.
Nope.
So, uh... what do you think it is about me?
Made a few calls, pulled some strings, and they agreed to seat us at 11:30 if we both had the chicken and didn't get desert.
Wait! You look? You-you massaged me.
Yes, if the presents are hidden south for the winter.
First of the month.
Hey, so can you make it on Friday?
We can? All right, I'm tryin' that.
He took my essence!
No, it can mean anything. Like uh, all of the sudden you're jealous because I've become the apartment stud.
Um, ok... the... the fifth dentist caved and now they're all recommending Trident?
What if they're not? What if it's adopted by a king?
Nice shooting!
Well, why can't you do them tomorrow?
I do! Want a hint? huh? "I do" "I do".
What?
Bye! Thank God
I mean, what am I supposed to do with myself?
I know!
I... I don't know... you seem lovely.
I don't have travel insurance.
Okay, well I'm gonna get Ross, get the cameras, and get them developed. 32 Joe. You're 32!
Wow! Really?! We get all this rusty crap for free?!
There's nobody here Joe.
This reminds me of a very specific part of the tape. Okay, here we go.
It bodes well for me that speed impresses you.
So they're going on dates? When?
Honestly? Me too.
No, no, this is the first time.
I-I can't believe Jill's gone. I can't help it, I opened a gate.
Hey!
Hi sweetie. So, what was with all the whispering?
So, what're you gonna do?
Nothin! This is the nine millionth ring store we've been too and I can't find the perfect ring! Ugly ring! Ugly ring! Ugly ring! It's a beautiful selection.
Yes! Yes, but I can only pay $8,000.
All right look, I'm changing it to 50 bucks, or your best offer.
No-no-no-no. Hey!
Hey.
Oh No, It's Terrific, It'S- It'S- Y'Know, You Deserve This, After All Your Years Of Struggling, You'Ve Finally Been Able To Crack Your Way Into Show Business.
It's Clint. It's Clint!
Well... there's surrogacy, but Monica has dreamt her whole life of carrying a child, she has felt that watching a surrogate would be... too hard for her.
I'm sorry. I'm-I'm-I'm sorry that I said I was going to when I'm not. Look, this has nothing to do with you, y'know? And this isn't Rachel's fault. It's me. I have serious, serious problems when it comes to women. I have issues with commitment, intimacy, mascara goop. And I'm really sorry, it's just that this is not, this isn't going to work out.
The meaning of the box is three fold. One , it gives me the time to think about what I did. Two , it proves how much I care about my friendship with Joey. And three , it hurts!
Okay, let's play! The big game, Italy vs. China, apparently.
You think?
I don't see any uh, cabs. Maybe we should just walk?
So you might say, it's a magic ring.
Ooh, yum!
Prague?
'Cause, I wanted to uh, give you this.
Not once did we do that.
Okay, she is the star of the play. And she is my girlfriend! I get to have sex with the star of the play!
Hey.
Bing doesn't seem so weird now, does it?
Yes, money well spent!
....with??
Okay, what do you guys think?
She had a point.
Uh-huh.
If we keep talking this way, aren't we gonna freak her out soon?
You know, I'd love to, but I'm a little tired.
I have no idea.
No, sir.
Okay.
Do you want a calculator?
Janice?
Mrs. Tedlock. You're looking lovely today. And may I say, that is a very flattering sleeve length on you.
Excuse, I seem to have dropped my ball.
Hey!
ah-ha!
Stunning entertainment center. Fine, fine Italian craftsmanship.
No, I mean, come on, seriously think about it, we get married, we're up at the altar and I'm like this.
What?
Hey Joe! We've got a couple of things we've got to check out at the new house. You want to come with us?
I know about Monica.
Eh...
Do you remember talking to me yesterday?
Yeah alright. What're these, raisins?
Y'know I think we should invite them.
I didn't know Ross and you were so close.
What are you doing tonight?
Me.
That's not true. I came with Monica and I'm leaving with Weird Al.
Okay, that's enough honey!
You said no right?
Deposit my specimen? You know, usually I have to call a 900 number for that kind of talk. Thanks, got it.
Hi. Anybody know a good tailor?
Hey! How come I'm stuck dicing, when he gets to ball the melon.
Well I like both eggs equally.
Well, it makes me feel sad, but...
Joey, there was a little girl who lived here, but she died like 30 years ago.
Joey... Switzerland?
I am strong! I'll show you!
Oh, thanks! I'm... actually thinking about becoming a motivational speaker.
Yeah, I know, but all of those little annoying things she did before we fell in love? Like her voice, her laugh, her personality-Well, they're all back! Y'know? And she's picked up like nine new ones!
Is that why you became a chef? So that people would like you?
Her name is Erica.
Yeah, that's when if you get the babies out by the end of the month, they give you 2% financing.
In London?
Oh my God this doesn't count! Okay? The interview was over, that was the real Chandler Bing in there, this is just some crazy guy out in the hall! Call security! There's a crazy guy out in the hall!
She picked those out too.
I know.
What?
I think she looks cute. ... but I am wrong!
Really? You got us a chick and a duck?
Well, Chandler will be there for you too. I mean, well, he might be a little late, but-but, he'll be there. And he'll bring you some cold soda, if want you need him for is that you're really hot.
Okay, so he's out of here.
No! That would be so awkward! Look-Besides, we work in different departments. He's on the sixth floor y'know? So he calls me Toby once in a while. What's the big deal? It could be worse, it's not like he's calling me Muriel.
There you go! There you are!
I know.
Yeah, we really missed you guys.
We're the Bings.
I'm sorry, it was a one-time-thing. I was very drunk and i was somebody else's subconscious.
"Big guy?"
Whoa-whoa-whoa, what are we going to do about my job?
I think so. Yeah, get off me.
Did you not hear me say, "Du-ude?!"
Can we read it? Can you print out another copy?
Ah, let's see. What next? Blow a bubble. A bubble's good. It's got a... boyish charm, it's impish. Here we go.
Cheese you say? That's some pretty smelly work, huh Don?
Me too.
What if Joey were president?
All right, kids, I gotta get to work. If I don't input those numbers,... it doesn't make much of a difference...
Oh my God that's it, that's the ring! How much is it?
Yeah, I don't you should say that even when you're healthy.
What are you talking about?
Okay, so when do you want to go?
Ah. Chandler Bing.
Skidmark's still got a way with the ladies.
Software that facilitates inter-business networking e-solutions?
You know what? I'm not gonna end up like this. I'll see you man.
Life-sized Imperial Storm Troopers from Sharper Image?
No-no-no, if you unplug it, I'll have nothing to show for my day! It would be like I was at work. No! Hey look at that! Look at that, it's still there! This thing must have some kind of primitive ROM Chip in it or something!
I know, me too. Hey! Y'know what if we went away for a whole weekend? Y'know we'd have no interruptions and we could be naked the entire time.
Good, good. Listen, heh, I dunno what Shelley told you about me, but, uh... I'm not.
It's not a big deal. It's, just it's right here, and it's all the time.
You kissed my best Ross! ...Or something to that effect.
And I'm the happiest guy in the world! Oh honey, come on don't be upset. We still have so much to look forward to!
No!
I'll do it.
Hey, Joe, I gotta ask. The girl from the Xerox place buck naked , or, or a big tub of jam.
If she asks, I protested a little, but ok!
No. No, I won't. Do you know why I took all those lessons? See, for the first time I didn't want you to be embarrassed to be seen on the dance floor with some clumsy idiot.
Well I, I think we'd remember something like that.
Yeah, well, I miss the tip! It's the best part. It has the nail.
Can you figure out what I'm doing?
Really?
It's up to you.
What?!
Why her mom?
Sorry, we're on a major flan high.
What?
Well, remember the first time we saw Jaws?
I have my reasons.
No! Danielle, hi! It's, uh, it's Chandler! I'm fine. Uh, listen, I don't know if you tried to call me, because, uh, idiot that I am, I accidentally shut off my phone. Oh, uh, okay, that's fine, that's great. Okay. She's on the other line, she's gonna call me back. She's on the other line, she's gonna call me back, she's on the other line, gonna call me back...
All right look, if you're not gonna stay for me, then at least stay for them! Okay, they have had a very difficult year! What with the robbery and all!
Okay, there's something different though--Oh my God! You smoked!
Look out kids, he's coming!
Step away from the duck.
Hey! How'd the audition go?
With the balled-up socks? I figured you taught him that.
That's what you say at the end of a date.
Yeah, and not that you would, but I wouldn't hang out with...all the guys in my office.
Mint!
Oh uh, o, OK.
Chicks don't swim.
Cry?! I just found a talking puppy, I'm rich!
I have no idea what's going on, but I am excited!
Eh. I thought that was an alp.
Y'know what? We're not sad, we're not sad, we're just not 21 anymore. Y'know? I'm 29 years old, damnit! And I want to sit in a comfortable chair, and watch television and go to bed at a reasonable hour!
Oh, is this about you-you dating the nurse? Yeah, Joey already told me, and I am so-so fine. I mean, you and I we're just, y'know, we're nothing, we're goofin' around.
Oh come on, by age seven kids have already seen orgies. Was it just me?!
So did Monica tell you about this great band called the Swing Kings that we're trying to get to play at the wedding?
Okay, I gotta ask, who calls us that?!
Well, your kind of sitting in my seat.
Oh really? Uh, Monica said she had a date at 9:00.
Y'know, when you say partner it doesn't sound cop. It, it sounds gay.
Ok!
More coffee over here, please!
And the inventor of the door rests happily in his grave.
Du-ude!
Noo.
Bob!
No, no, no, actually losers rhyme.
Actually, we already found a house we love.
Yes! Yes! A thousand times, yes!
How is that ever going to happen?!
Well?
Hey listen, for the first four years of my work everybody called me Sha-la-lap. Seriously.
Please God don't let it be Kung Pow Chicken.
I so am.
We are supposed to make these decisions together! Did you not watch the Doctor Phil I taped for you?
Hey.
You do know, I can just turn them the other way around, right?
Okay, but let's do it now though, because Chopper 5 just lost it's feed!
Oh, uh, yeah... I just knew that sometimes when you're writing, you... you don't always know the exact time.
Hey, woah, hey, woah.
Hey!!
All right, Janice, likes him. In fact she likes him so much she put him on her freebie list.
That was in the fourth grade. How could you still be upset about that?
You're obviously not their favorite pet.
Okay, excuse me for a minute.
Okay, so Rachel's got 48 and Phoebe has the lead in...vegetables, Joey?
Yeah, but Sebastian? What is that? A cat's name?
Might wanna try Joseph.
Yeah, I wanna go to babe.
OK well here, we'll just move the coffee table closer to the couch.
No Rach, it's not just you. My thirtieth birthday certainly wasn't that much fun.
What?!
Yes, but...
Okay, ten bucks says that we can name every item in that bag.
Doug!!
You know, guys I got to say. This means so much to me. That you would trust me with your child. I mean, we all know that Monica and I have been trying to have a baby of our own. You know I've had my doubts about my skills as a father, but that you two.. that you two....
Hello? Hello?
Hey, you know what? Maybe we should keep them here with you.
Well, it's official there are no good movies.
Y'know, it's been a while since we've screamed something. Maybe we should.
Okay, yeah, I think it's really stuck now.
Hardest thing I've ever done in my life.
Yes, I realise that.
Monica's a little drunk.
Really? What do you do? You just sit in there stewing in your own filth.
You have every reason to be upset. We did lie. But only because we've been waiting and trying to have a baby for so long. Now we don't know how long it's gonna be before we can get another chance again.
Hey.
I couldn't find anything at Joey--Hey-hey, oh hey!
Oh come on!
I'll go.
Huh.
Nice!
What's going on?
I have no idea.
What?
Forget it! Okay, I'm not giving up the apartment.
Hike!
Well it couldn't have been worse. A woman literally passed through me. OK, so what is it, am I hideously unattractive?
Phoebe found your pregnancy test in the trash.
Y'know I rued the day once...didn't get a whole lot else done.
Yep!
Sure, then you should get a mini skirt so you can really show it off.
Well now you have two. Hey, I am good at math.
Great, because my shoes are giving me a little problem on the dance floor, can I borrow the boots from your costume?
Hey, you just wanna forget about raquetball and hang out here?
Uhh, no-no thanks.
We have to leave for New York in an hour.
Well, I was trying to prove that I was right. Y'know? And it turns out I was wrong. And now it's lodged in my throat.
Why?
In my defense, it was dark and he was a very pretty guy.
Uhh, no.
You had a dream about a girl that I am seeing?! Oh, that is so cool! I can't tell you how many times I've dreamt about a girl that he was seeing. Anyway we're talking about your dream. I love you. Your dream?
Uhh... Yeah sure. Click!
Are you kidding? Okay, I'll give you a hint; I'll give you a hint.
What?
I'm not worried, I'm uh, I'm fascinated. Y'know it's like uh, Biology! Which is funny because in high school I uh, I-I failed Biology and tonight Biology failed me.
Ground control to Major Tom! Commencing countdown...engines...on!
You couldn't be cool.
You-you do?
She was working on Valentine's Day so we're celebrating it tonight.
I've met the perfect woman. OK, we're sitting on her couch, we're fooling around, and then suddenly she turns to me and says, 'Do you ever want to do it in an elevator?'
Am not!
Oh, uh, listen, about tonight...
She said she'd call me.
Okay, what is in here? Rocks?
Okay, I went over to Ross' apartment to bring back Clunkers. Y'know, for you, and... I left the door open and she must have gotten out and I looked everywhere, all over the apartment, including the roof, which FYI Ross, one of your neighbors, growing weed. I couldn't find him, and I am so, so, so, sorry. But I do know where we could all go ease the pain.
I'd just like to say that I'm totally behind this experiment. In fact, I'd very much like to butter your head.
Yeah, actually. So, you read a file that you liked and you gave the agency the serial number and they contacted us?
Hey! Babe! Aren't you excited we're going on our honeymoon?
If you win, we give up the birds.
Yeah, I know, I-I wish I had too, but y'know I-I think this is a good thing. Y'know? 'Cause we've had our first fight, and now we can move on. Y'know, I know for me- Nick's pants?
Oh, okay!
Oh, yeah, that hug looked pretty brutal.
Yeah, I think I do! Y'know what? You move in with her! You move in with her right now! Maybe I should in with Monica!
You know me sir. Oh ah, I do have a question for ya. Do you know how I get around the office computer network so I can access the really good Internet porn?
Daddy. All right look, here's the story. Well, we had just finished playing racquetball and we were gonna take a steam. I walk into the steam room and it was really steamy. So I take off my glasses and that's when in happened.
Oh, you dont know. Helen, could you make sure we put through the paperwork on Miss Bookbinders raise?
Actually, I don't like martinis.
Oh, that's cool. Then I'll just bring them both over.
Oh yeah, totally!
I am so much older than these other interns. I can't compete with them.
No, actually Laurie's a boy.
Congratulations!/Good for you!/Great!
Okay, I'll give them back. Look! What is so great about that sandwich?
Oh well, this was a really important experience for me, and I wanted to share it with you.
I see, I see, y-y-you're trying to freak me out.
I'm sorry man.
Okay and he hasn't proposed yet because she has no ring on her finger.
What are we gonna do?
Wow!
I'm sorry. If you ask me, I'd move in with him.
Hey, no way! Come on, this is you guys, call her and work it out.
Okay.
And they don't like it when you explain why your jokes are funny.
Who did you originally want to hook up with?
Out of my league. I could get a Brian. If I wanted to get a Brian, I could get a Brian. Hey, Brian.
WENUS. Weekly Estimated Net...
You tell me! Maybe, it's because I was just fooling with my ex! Oh no-no-no-no, no-no-no-no, that was you!!
Hey!
I'm sorry, he's a little bit wound up, we had to stop at every maple candy stand on the way here.
Nice camoflauge man, for a minute there I almost didn't see ya.
Just so I know, how many more of those can I expect?
Now that I untangled you, how 'bout you doing a little something for me?
It means we're holding hands.
Thank you.
Oh my God, it's that Victoria's Secret model. Something... something Goodacre.
Could be Casey.
Okay, so I guess that's about ah, two weeks before the topless thing kicks in.
I quit and you learn what I do?
Yes! Chandler Bing, 7! Chandler Bing, 0.
Aww, I love you so...
An invitation for the At First Sight premiere? Oh my God! Val Kilmer didn't wear this in Batman! He wore it to the premiere of some tooty-fruity love story where he played a blind guy!
So um, Mary-Angela, what's your second favorite?
So you don't have the cameras?!
Alright, you did it! Do we have any fruit?
Hey!
Yes, this, this was pleasant.
Yes it was very sad when the guy stopped drawing the deer!
Hey!
Dangerous Liaisons.
Okay, listen this really hurts. Let's go.
I want to say you but, that seems like such an easy answer.
Good morning, everybody.
No, actually I meant my fingers. Look at 'em, look at how happy they are.
Hey so, did uh, did she move out?
If only there was something in your head to control the things you say.
Oh, come on! I don't care! Come on! Whose is it?
That all the pieces of my life are falling right into place!
I'm going to need a bigger boat.
Uh-oh.
Yeah.
Word!
I wasn't staring. I was leering.
Okay, bye, champ. Now, I know there's gonna be a lot of babes in San Diego, but remember, there's also a lot to learn.
No. No I'm just tired. Y'know, from-from the walk.
Thanks man.
This is not going to work.
Oh that's not true.
Uh, are you crazy? Are you insane? If you live with Phoebe, you two are gonna be y'know, live-living together!
Okay, okay, I tell you what. You roll another hard eight; and we get married here tonight.
Again?!
Uh, Rach... I think I have something that belongs to you.
Because I'm gonna play for ya.
What d'ya know... It's a treat for the eyes and the ears.
Well, y'know two regulars. And ah one that barely qualifies as... Ahh, what?
So- you can tell?
The only reason you're doing this to Joey is because you're bored. Okay, it's not his fault that you're unemployed.
Hey, is Rachel here?
Hey!
Just coffee! Where are we gonna hang out now?
No, she's still upset because I saw her boobies.
No, no, no, no! No, no, no, no! It's okay, it's okay. I didn't go. Don't cry, it's just a bit! I'm your uncle Chandler; funny is all I have!
Well, this is much better.
Hey! This is where your hyper-organized-pain-in-the-ass stuff pays off!
Are you actually saying these words?
Okay.
Here you go. Now stop bringing us pizzas you.
Apology accepted. Excuse us.
I'm not in a meeting. I'm right... Whoops.
All right, so you're telling me that I have to tell racist jokes now?!
Well, at least the perfume is not mine, be thankful for that!
Ok.
Had it.
Almost over man.
Okay. Okay. All right. Help! Am I a Mark, or a John?
Oh, I can't believe my sperm have low motility because, let me tell you, when I was growing up they sure seem to be in a hurry to get places!!
Boys? We're going in.
yeah just some good old fashion girl on girl American action.
It's Paris, who knows we're here!
You built a fort didn't ya?
Our new fridge? I don't live here anymore.
It must be a virus. I think it erased your hard drive.
Yeah?
It was the ring!
Oh all right.
What's going on?
A pharmacist.
All right. Now go see Miss Kitty and she'll fix you up with a nice hooker.
Oh my God!
Is this a service you're providing me?
Does South Oregon have a sports-team? There you go.
Unfortunately that is correct.
Consider Casey.
Give me it!
Y'know what, I'm gonna uh, play the field just a little more.
Uh, Julie.
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!!
Well, that's the best kiss I've had with anyone I've ever met in a men's room.
Oh well, that, that makes it not terrible.
Did you make it, or are you just serving it?
So if Monica's not around, then I'm not good enough to raise Emma?
Fine!
Well let's....let's see what everybody thinks of that?
Where are they? Where are they?
Joey, what-wh-wh-wha-wh-wha-wh-wha-wh-wha-what are you doing here?
All right, ready?
Yeah, not bad right? You know what, Monica's gonna be working late, so I'm gonna make this place spotless. You know what else I'm gonna do, know what else I'm gonna do? I'm gonna go downstairs, I'm gonna get her some flowers. Now who wouldn't wanna live with me?
Ah-ha, you're not the boss of me. Yeah, you are! Ooh, saucy.
So Ross, how was your date the other night? Did you tell her about the magical ride that starts with the flush of every toilet?
I'm not sure what they did, but I'm inclined to blame Enron.
Whoa-ho, back off, Missy!
Oh hey, it's, it's terriffic. I mean it's a regular space... fest.
Look, we're not just messing around! I love her. Okay, I'm in love with her.
You are, you're gonna leave me like this?
Y'know I am the groom right? I was told it was kinda big deal.
Oh yeah? Well, how'd she take it?
Okay.
We're doomed. Okay, they're gonna take 50 bucks out of our accounts for the rest of our lives. What are we gonna do?
All right, all right, I'll go sleep with my girlfriend. But I'm just doing it for you guys.
Uh, Ross?
He said...he said, he said that they're having a great time. I'm sorry. But, the silver lining, if you wanna see it, is that he made the decision all by himself! Without any outside help whatsoever.
You.
We are gonna be great parents.
Nope! Every once and a while I just scream stuff at the TV.
Ooh, I don't know if we're there yet.
Phebes, it was your birthday, like, months ago.
Oh.
See, maybe that's the one we should've actually hidden.
Well, before we answer that, I think we should address the more important question. How dumb are you?
But I didn't get to shake my belly like a bowl full of jelly.
Luckily, the guy she settled for can't hear what you're talking about.
So you came to the room looking for Joey? Did you ever in-intend on telling me about this?
Oh My God! You can do a duet of Ebony and Ivory all by yourself!
It's weird! In a doctor's office?
Hey.
You slept with somebody three hours after you thought you broke up. I mean bullets have left guns slower!
At least as long as I have the pants.
Wait. Before we go in, I just want you to know I love you. I had a great time on our honeymoon, and I can't wait to go in there and spend the rest of our life together.
What's with the word y'all? You know, just... two words just... pushed together... Are we all allowed to do that, because if so, I say why stop there? You know, your new poodle could be your noodle. And fried chicken? Could be fricken.Waiter, waiter excuse me, I'll have the fricken? See, that's... that's funny with the fricken, right?
Uh, yeah, I just got my pick-up sticks back from the shop. Bring your nerves of steel.
All right, ready?
Hey look, are we gonna have to bring this out every time Ross comes over?
Monica said wedding.
I'll bet his dad doesn't think so.
Well, she probably wasn't familiar with the process having spent most of her life sitting for oil paintings!
Monica got ice in her eye, and it hurts.
Okay.
That.
No! I just happened t'do a lot trivias about smoking in different states. For example, in Hawaii cigarettes are called Leyhallalookoos.
That's not what I had in mind! See, people like Ross don't generally wear these types of pants. You see, they're very tight. Maybe there's something in that area.
All right, I suppose I can wait a day. Hey, what are you doing Friday?
No, see, I'm trying this new screening thing. You know, I figure if I'm always answering the phone, people'll think I don't have a life. My god, Rodrigo never gets pinned.
Do you think that there's a town in Missouri or some place called Sample? And ah, as you're driving into town there's-there's like a sign, and it says "You're in Sample."
Yes! Good thing we have that, 'Not in New York' rule.
No I didn't!
Here, here!
We will take a moonlit walk on the Rue de la .
Hey!
Me too!!
What, what are you laughing at?
Hey!
What if I had had the guts to quit my job? I'd probably be writing for the New Yorker, getting paid to be funny. But my job's fun too! I mean tomorrow, I-I don't have to wear a tie.
You did.
What happened?!!
Oh that's great! Great! Thanks! But that dress I mean it's like yuck! It's terrible! It makes me wanna just rip it right off of you!
Y'know what else I can't believe? I had to kiss Phoebe and Rachel every time I left a room, I mean it's too bad they didn't see us having sex.
Yeah, well, don't expect that to happen anytime soon!
Oh, hurry up. I want to sign that.
I don't think the contestants are supposed to speak to each other.
Oh, it would be you! You! Monica! And you'd get all the votes!
Hey, check out that girl! She is really hot!
No reason.
'Kay!
Well, I'm, I'm sorry... Ahhh. Have we met?
By the way, this didn't seem so dorky in the hall.
Ah! The high road...
Hey, look, what do you want me to say? Do you want me to say that I'll stop seeing her?
Oh it's been going on way to long now. Y'know, I mean the first time he said it we were just passing each other in the hallway, so I didn't say anything. And then the next time he said, "Hey Toby, do you want a donut?" And I-I wanted a donut. And now it's five years later, the donut's gone and I'm still Toby.
Actually Monica and I are engaged.
I'll make something up! I'm good at lying, I actually did borrow your Walkman!
This is so bad. If-if you're not Mary-Angela, then-then who is?
I always knew you were gonna make it. I'm so proud of you.
Hey, you know who used to have nails like that?
Oh, it's just some crazy guy who roams the halls here. He's great with kids though.
Well, somebody should.
Why?! Why do I have to tell him?!
Yeah, wow.
Pheebs! We have to take you to the hospital now!
Tough crib.
Great! Now, the score is 7 to almost 7.
Oh, I got some thoughts on that.
We can talk about that.
This is not out of the blue, this is smack dab in the middle of the blue.
Forget it, that's off.
How do you feel about the, "I really did forgot the present, please forgive me" not fake out?
Don't try to sway her. I'm your only chance to have a baby. Okay, let's go.
Do either of you have the keys?
I can't take the big white dog! You love it!
Okay, Pheebs, we decided the picnic idea was a little... Y'know, it didn't have any... It-it, well it blew. So, we thought, that this afternoon that we would all go away for the whole weekend to, Atlantic City!
Well, it'll probably slow it down at first but, once I get used to the extra weight, I'll be back on track.
By me?
I'm telling you, he's great! I mean, even if my sperm worked fine, I'd think he'd be the way to go!
No, Beth doesn't die, she doesn't die. Does she Rachel?
Can we start over?
Eeeshk.
I'll give you a thousand dollars to talk to us.
Oh yeah. I'll take, I'll take your picture.
If that doesn't keep kids in school, what will?
I'd carry you around in my pocket.
You know, I think I might just.
Well that's the brilliance of it. The pretty people... and the running.
Excuse me little one, I have a very solid backhand.
Okay, easy Martina. I think we should let them win the next game.
Honey I... I love your breasts the way they are!
Hey!
What a wank!
Someone I don't know sent me an e-mail and I opened it.
Yeah, y'know what I got a better idea. How-how 'bout it blocks none of mine door and a lot of yours?
Of course it was!
But only because I was up all night worried about this meeting, ain't that funny? Irony? Not a fan, alright . See, here's the thing. I went home and told my wife about Tulsa and she won't go. See, me, I love Tulsa! Tulsa is heaven! Tulsa is Italy-Please don't make me go there!
Let me think. Let me think-Oh! I don't care.
Yeah, because if I was at my old job we'd say 300 million? No thank you!
What, like a number?
There I am!
I can't believe you did this.
I got a good one, I got a good one! I once walked in on both my parents making love to the same guy.
Yeah, that's her.
90 seconds.
Well, look it's been a really emotional time y'know, and you've had a lot to drink. And you've just got to let that go okay? I mean you were the most beautiful in the room tonight!
Batman has a utility belt!
No sir.
Oh, aaaah!
Our adoption social worker is coming by today so we are cleaning the apartment.
But I'll tell you something. One of these days we're get off of our buts and rent Die Hard again!
Where have you been?! I tried to call you! I want to talk to you! I still feel so bad!
Shh! Nice to see you again.
No! No! No! No--one can beat me.
Great! Now, we can go to the Ranger game! Last night!
Sure, nice.
No you don't-get it in black, not brown.
A woman's
Yeah. Just let me grab my jacket and tell you I had sex today.
Okay, look, I'm gonna pull on the door and you guys push as hard as you can. Maybe we can get enough room to wiggle him out, okay? Okay, so PUSH!
Hello...? Have you seen Joey's bat?
Oh, she's sorry! I feel better!
Oh nope, I-I have plans with Joey.
Y'know I was thinking, what if I uh, unpack here?
The reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make a big deal out of it.
That thing that I have to do to make a baby. I faked it.
oh, honey..
What are you doing here?
Oh, ahh, no thanks, I just had an M&M.
Ok, ok, here we go.
Oh my God!
Yeah, I'm gonna stick with the ring. Oh, this one's nice! I like this one! Sir? Uh, kind sir? Can I see this one?
You bet I did, Ben, put it there! Well, it would have worked this time, if his hands weren't so damn small! Ho, ho, ho!
Why not? We could give each of them half a medallion, and then years later, they'll find each other and be reunited. I mean, that's a great day for everybody.
It was at the front door. When I got home. Somebody sent it to us.
Alright, so what's it about?
But if we win, we get your apartment.
Hey!
Jill says vestibule... I'm going with vestibule.
Your little men are gonna get scored on more times than your sister.
That was... Impressive.
There are seven?!
So, you and Rachel tonight, huh?
I know that too.
Yeah, and there's a bowl of cranberry sauce that... what happens to cranberry sauce?
Okay, our news. My company has asked me to head up our office in Tulsa , so as of Monday I'm being officially relocated.
I have *not* thought this through!
Oh, so you're already doing your part for the kids.
Oh, DAMN IT!
Art lover!
Hey, come on, we got the gift, the concert, and the cake.
I don't have your boots.
Oh, you're definately not. I haven't cried like that in years.
Where's Mary-Angela?
Eh!
No thanks, Mom!
Long!
Listen Phoebe, he's right. People are not supposed to have heart attacks at 31.
Happy birthday! I'm sorry.
Who walks into a room and asks to see a person's hands?!
You know, I mean, you can't tell your parents you were fired because they'd be disappointed.
Pheebs, can you help me pick out an engagement ring for Monica? I can't figure this out! It's so hard! Should I get her a Tiffany cut or a Princess cut or a-ah-ah! Paper cut!
Alright alright, we still have three hours till escrow closes on our house. We can still get out.
Alright, that's it. Look Joey, I'm sorry, I realize this is the role of a lifetime for ya, and if I could just fire Joseph, I would, but unfortunately that's not possible so I'm gonna have to let both of you go.
Yeah. Solid effort. Solid effort.
Monica.
Somewhere there is someone with a tranquilizer gun and a huge butterfly net looking for that man.
Why not?
Thank you.
Nothing! I said, I said "You're so great" and then I just, I just stopped talking!
Look, I figured I would try to convince him not to tell the story anymore, and I figure the best way to do that is face to face-And by face I don't mean his lap. And by face, I don't mean my ass.
No, no, no.
Look around, you guys. This was your first home. And it was a happy place, filled with love and laughter. But more important, because of rent control, it was a friggin' steal!
So uhh, how's the palace?
No! No! I don't want him to know we're yet! I'm not sure I'm ready for that. And besides he's not gonna be too happy to see me either.
I sure did.
That would be no. Look, just because you played tonsil tennis with my mom doesn't mean you know her. Alright? Trust me, you can't talk to her.
So tell me something, is leaving the Christmas lights up part of your plan to keep us merry all year long?
No.
You're right, it has been you dream for over 15 seconds.
And thank you for explaining to us what escrow means... I've already forgotten what you said, but thank you.
So you kissed her, so what happened after that?
The door hasn't been locked in five years, but okay! Ready?!
This is terrible. What am I going to do?
I personally could have a gallon of Alan.
All right look, forget it, forget it. You told her you love her, it's over.
I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done.
So, uh, you met someone, huh?
Y'know what Gunther, go ah, go ahead, I'm-I'm talking to ah, . This is the part where you say your name.
Where did you hear it from before?
I don't know, it's these new shoes, they're all slippery.
No, I prefer to keep a safe distance from all this merriment.
Oh yeah, that was great. Thanks to you, the hottest cocktail waitress there is quitting to teach the third grade!
No, I hope not! I tried to offer him some money, but he wouldn't take it.
That's totally understandable.
No,... no... NO! Look, I'm, I'm married!
It's nice.
If you need money, will you please-please just let me loan you some money?
What? Oh, yeah, I'm gonna be a junior copywriter.
That's what we were gonna name the baby.
And people say you don't pay attention. No, this is a much better job. It's vice-president of a company that does data reconfiguration and statistical factoring for other companies.
Yeah, I did.
It's like a giant hug.
Nothing, just your overcoat sounds remarkably like Brent Mussberger.
Hey, y'know what, maybe we should get going. I mean what time did Chloe say we should be there?
Nothing, nothing.
Why don't you open with a joke?
Because I'm in love with Monica!!
You're a genius!
Yeah, we are so sorry.
Laundry. Huh. Is that my new nickname?
Ok, while Ross is on the phone, everybody owes me 62 bucks for his birthday.
I sent them home.
We're taking a break!
For an emergency just like this.
Me! On my computer.
Now, Monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne...
That's right. You're husband's home. So, now the sex can stop.
Hey!... aaaaaahhhh!
Hey!
You need new clothes.
Yes please.
Can you ever feel your ears?
I know, this is a great apartment.
Y'know what? It's gonna be okay. Y'know what? She's probably not gonna even want to come.
Okay before we start the celebration, Monica has to go put on her party dress.
Ohhhhh!
It still wouldn't be clean. All I want is my freedom.
I figured I'd buy those. Pat, I'd like to buy a vow.
Her ass print is still on your grandmother's quilt, do you really want to talk about smoking?
I messed up, it was a meeting, everybody was smoking.
You dove in front of Ross! Ross!
Now you do that, you're on TV.
Well, it does not ring a bell with me...
Well, I see you've had a very productive day. Don't you think the cowboy hat is a little much?
Do you think I work at some kind of boot pricing company?
All right, I have to get that, but no-no. Hello? Hi! Yeah listen, I'm, I'm in need of a stripper and I was told that you do that. Let me ask you this, what, what do you do for the extra hundred? So would I, would I have to provide the grapes?
Y'know Richard...you are a good guy.
She's okay with Rachel and the baby?
We are NOT signing those papers.
Really?
Hello? Hello?
Well, it's a pretty big commitment, I mean, what if one of us wants to move out?
Well, ye, yes, actually, but, uh, they were my Aunt Edna's, and there were three of us in there.
Hey, listen. I'm never going to lie to you again, okay? And I want you to know that nobody thinks you're stupid.
Monica, we are not ready to have two babies!
It's okay, it's just an egg roll.
Oh dear God!
For camp!
As crazy as soccer?
Cookie?
Ok well, thanks, you won't regret it. I'll see you tomorrow .
What?
If this is the way all the Gellers flirt, we don't have a problem.
Okay.
Richard!
Well, maybe he had some kind of uh, new, cool style, that you're not familiar with. And uh maybe you have to get used to it.
We are bad people.
I'm watching the game, but I'm not deaf!
Are you telling me that you bought the chair that is making all other lounge systems obsolete? The chair that Sit magazine called the Chair of the Year?
I think I know what you mean though...the lamp is the hotel's, but the bulbs ...oh, you already got that.
Don't do anything. Keep it inside. Learn how to hide your feelings! Don't cry outloud.
All right.
Really stupid.
Bye-bye.
Sounds great.
Y'know, it'll be okay. It'll be okay. Because when they come over, I will be all charming, I will make them fall in love with me, and then we'll tell 'em.
F-hah.... flennin....
All right.
Those were like the best seats ever.
I don't know. I just had this weird sense. You know, but that's me. I'm weird and sensitive. Tissue?
I love you so much.
Run! Run you crazy, rich freak!
Actually, can I get some hot water with a little lemon? I think I strained my voice screaming in there. Does it have to be so loud?
Hello Rachel.
Well, why don't you check in one of my saddlebags while I chew on a bale of hay!
Mr. D, hows it going, sir?
I don't know! He went crazy! Y'know, we were playing that game where you-you ask a question and you answer it really fast.
Just give us the cheapest room you have.
Hello Phoebe, I've been thinking about you all day.
Did you do it on our invitations?!
Hey. Soaps? Shampoos? Are you really taking all this stuff?
Eh!
Okay, but don't you think this is a little extreme?
I thought we weren't gonna have bachelor/bachelorette parties! Y'know, we agreed that it was a silly tradition.
Lovely!
Why am I hearing cheering?
I don't know what that's like?! Up until I was 25 I thought the only response to, "I love you," was, "Oh crap!"
Almost as good as that play with the two naked girls on the see-saw.
Phoebe if it helps Alexandra has only been massaging Monica for like three years. If! I said, "If it helps!"
I don't know! What could she possibly be hiding in here that I can't see?!
Okay.
Why? What happened to him?
Oh I just got another rejection letter. They said my writing was funny, just not "Archie Comic funny."
But then later that night...
No! Ok, this is not good. You are a guy. Ok? This is a guys place. If you let this go, you're going to be sitting around with your fingers soaking in stuff.
Hi!
Math!! You're giving me math! All right, look y'know what, forget about it, you go for the girl, we'll see who gets her.
Monica says that her Maitre D. is the funniest guy she's ever met.
I mean, I was sitting there.
Yeah, I miss that too. I tell you what; from now on we'll make time to hang out with each other.
Hi there.
Well, my secretary is gonna be out for a couple of weeks. She is having one of her boobs redused. It's a whole big boob story.
I don't think we've actually done this before!
I can't believe we're doing this.
Say goodbye elves, I'm off to Tulsa.
You already know.
Really...? See... that's the thing: you gotta keep it smart, people!
Woah, woah, I've put on a little weight?
She was a welder.
Oh, I know. This must be so hard. Oh, no. Two women love me. They're both gorgeous and sexy. My wallet's too small for my fifties, and my diamond shoes are too tight.
She's really going to love this, you know? The bottom line is I want her to have it, even if I don't get to be the one who gives it to her.
Woah, woah, that's not pretty!
We really need to take those tests?
Well I do, but uh, Eddie makes them this way and, well they're pretty darn good.
Well, I tried Billy Jean King, but... you know, you and Monica have the same "I'm gonna kill you" look...? I can usually make it go away by kissing her...
What did you do?
Hey.
I like it in the stern. ...of the boat. Hello.
So this is nice! I wish I didn't have to go, believe me! But unfortunately I have to. Oh uh, by the way, what's the name the girl you're dating?
Uh, Yes. Yes. Ive just been going over your data here, and little thing, youve been post-dating your Friday numbers.
I am here, on my knees, holding up these couch cushions as a symbol of my sorrow and regret, much like they did in biblical times. Though you may haveth anger now. . .
You're kidding! Did you tell her I wasn't?
I can save you time ladies, I'm right here.
Oh my God, introduce us!
Hey ladies! What are you in here for?
You too.
I am your friend, and I am not gonna let you do this!! You are surprisingly strong!
Are you sure he's gonna be able to crack that code?
No I didn't!
Oh, I have to get married in James Bond's tux!
Well, no, although I did have an imaginary friend, who... my parents actually preferred.
Oh yes!
Look, we're not just messing around! I love her. Okay, I'm in love with her.
Wait a minute, wait. You're telling me this actress person is the only woman you ever wanted who didn't want you back?!
See ya. Goodbuy you fruit drying psychopath. So you want me to help you unpack your stuff?
Jeannie, the head of east coast operations Jeannie?
Does this mean we're gonna have to start paying for coffee?
No, he's right, I'm totally lying.
What've you been up to?
Yes! Ross, you have to stay!
Oh.
You don't want to be guys, you'd be all hairy and wouldn't live as long.
Nude... ... pictures of Anna Kournikova. I'm so sorry.
Y'know what, pretty good.
Well, not me. But that's what's happened, and, ah, and, and there's more. We should take a trip.
Okay. How about in that cabinet?
Two hours, that lasted!
See Joe, we want you to tell stories but y'know, romantic stories. Nice stories.
I wouldn't read too much into it.
Uh-huh.
Ahh, Merry Christmas; I miss you guys!
All right, let's break this down. What exactly did he say to you?
Right. You know what? Actually I just get off the plane, so I'm feeling kinda gross. Maybe I should just take a shower.
Okay. I can't believe tomorrow's the big day.
oh, oh, yeah, ok, thanks. I can't believe I didn't even think of that. I guess I was just so worried about having to... come here and do... 'that'...
There has got to be a way!
Did you have a crush on me, when you first met me?
Stretchy pants! Why, those are the greatest things in the world! If I were you I would wear them every day, every day!
Yes, yes eight.
They have that on the napkins at the club.
Honey, it's gonna be okay.
Well the vet seems to think that's she's becoming a rooster. We're getting a second opinion.
Where the hell is everybody? Bitter lady: Why don't you like me?! Chapter One: My first period.
All right, I will help you out but you have to promise me you will not tell anyone what I am about to tell you.
Oh yeah!
You didn't like that?
Come on! I was there! I know he's the love of your life.
Okay. What if we lived together and you understand what I'm saying?
Our kids are gonna be fat aren't they.
Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas!
It was fine, y'know? But she didn't agree with me as strongly as she agreed with Joey. She was more like, "I see you point, I'm all right with it."
Man, I am so beat.
That was amazing.
I love you so much.
Yay!
Maybe it's the sound of Ross climbing into my brain and stealing my thoughts.
Forget it, that's off.
Okay, could you just stop talking for a second? Yemen. That's right, yes, I'm being transferred to Yemen!
Ah, you obviously saw my personal ad.
...And what did you bring?
If you clear things up with Rachel then Ross never needs to find out, but you have to do it now before he hears about it and kicks your ass!
Okay, well. Janice said 'Hi, do I look fat today?' And I, I looked at her....
See buddy, that's all you need, a bunch of toothless guys hitting each other with sticks.
Hello!
Sorry.
What?!
Hey Joey, do you wanna play football or you wanna.. Hi, I'm Chandler.
Nope, not under here!
Look forget it okay? I don't want to go. I don't want to see him. I don't wanna.
Hey, Ben, remember us? Ok, the mole came off.
Oh no, you see, actually it is.
That was you?! I thought it was Jack!
Detroit.
Yeah, I think it is!
But I do know that it's some time tomorrow.
Hey, I can be smooth. Listen, we're a little bit in a hurry, so, if you can get us a table a little quicker, I'd appreciate it.
You be cool.
Hey!
What?
So how's Mindy?
Does anyone else think David Copperfield is cute?
Yeah, I mean, it would be rude to them for us to leave now.
Yeah.
Well, let's just say that Krog will be fully equipped to destroy the universe again in twelve to fourteen hours.
Oh good. Good, because I'm sure this interview is gonna last a couple of weeks.
Yeah! You?
Should we call the spitter?
Did she go out with him?
See, I told you they don't swim.
Seriously?
And the world will never know.
They got a breakfast buffet.
Well y'know a lot of those Muppets don't have thumbs.
Do you have any beers? We're out of beers.
I don't think of her that way, you know, she's a, she's a colleague.
Why?
Okay. So uh, Ross is kinda bummed huh?
Joey!
Uh, yes, yes it is.
No you can't.
USA Today.
Oh come on! He said he was going to do my inseam, and he ran his hand up my leg, and then, there was definite...
Well, I'm crazy about her now. I think this could be the real thing. Capital 'R'! Capital 'T'! Don't worry, those are the right letters.
Hey.
Yeah, here, somewhere else, y'know where-where ever.
I wanna quit the gym.
Oooo-ooh!
That's where people make number two!!
Hey-hey!
Jeez, man did you fall.. Hi! So ah, did ya, did-did-did ya fall high?
I know.
So-You got in voluntarily?!
Ohh. Mmm.
Hey!
Wh-wh-why, wh-why, why, why was there kissing!? There should be no kissing!!
But I don't wanna do it in a cup!
But I think we should tell her.
What's it about?
I have no name.
I don't know.
OK, so at this point, the dealer...
Hey!
Y'know what you should do, just toss 'em in the shedder and claim you never got 'em.
What do we use to split it?
Hey, look, this name has been holding me back my entire life. Okay, it's probably why kids picked on me in school, and why I never do well with women... So, as of 4 o'clock tomorrow, I'm either gonna be Mark Johnson or John Markson.
Hi there!
I'll take a card.
Oh my God.
But honey you don't have to.
...betrothed couple.
No-no, why don't you hang on to that one.
Air hole! Air hole!!
Honey, you're screaming.
Don't worry, I'm brave! I am brave! I...I am brave! No-no-no-no!! Can you tell me who is there please?
Oh hey! There's some kids playing in the street, you wanna go down there and give them a project, ruin their day?
Doesn't know, "Hello." But she knows Capricorn One.
You told her?!
Joey and I can finish up in the guest room.
The reason we haven't told them we're together is because they hate me, okay? So will you fix this?
I'm in the bathroom, can you come in here? I think there's something wrong.
Tomorrow night is good. Tomorrow night is good, but uh, y'know what? Why put off something till tomorrow that you can do right now? Eldad come here!
What would she get for herself for two thousand dollars that she wouldn't tell me about?
My chair. Now, if anybody asks, your name is Rosita!
Paid your phone bill?
Say, Joe, I had a strange idea of what we could do for our last night. What do you say we play a little uh, foosball for money?
Merry Christmas, you guys!
Yeah, listen, Joey isn't gonna be here tonight so why don't you come over and I'll let you uh, feel my bicep. Or maybe more.
He's the headliner of a gay burlesque show.
Good idea. Where do you want to go to lunch?
Okay.
Oh, that's mature.
This sounds like a hernia. You have to-you-you go to the doctor!
Fear of Triscuts?
I wanna quit the gym.
Oh my God! Those are my bedroom eyes?! Why did you ever sleep with me?
Okay.
You don't owe me anything, I don't want you money...
Oh no..don't thank me. Thank you. You know there's not one thing I would change about you? Not one single thing! And definitely not... two... single things.
Well, we have to do something. We can't have her living next door. Oh, that does it too.
That would be a lot more convincing if you weren't drooling.
Come on! Joe!
The nerve huh?
They got a phone in there, right?
Fine!
Why are you wearing my apron?
Why?! What happened?!
Crazy bitch.
I wasn't sure which one Mary-Angela was. Look, I'm sorry okay, I was really drunk, and you all look really similar.
Ehh, you're just liquored up.
Really.
You can't make this stuff up!
Really?
No, I have a great idea for a present for her.
He really is a chameleon.
It happened in London.
No I'm serious, we should tell each other everything. I do not have any secrets from you.
I didn't know you read tea leaves.
No problem.
So?
Well, so why not go knock?
Ah that's a cantelope.
99...100! Ready or not, here I come! All right, let's go over the concept one more time.
Of course, of course not. I just have to uh, go over to the place where I-I made it and pick-pick it up.
You wanna hug it out?
Yeah?
No I don't! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
Okay.
Hey.
Okay, hear me out. Okay? You give the best bad massages. If anybody was looking for the best bad massage and they were thinking to themselves, "Who's the best of that?" They'd have to go to you.
It's a traditional Mexican custard dessert...Look talk to Monica, she's on the food committee.
So you don't get paid unless the movie makes money?
Uh Joe, when it's one o'clock in the morning and you don't come by? That's okay!
Well she's, she's the kinda girl-Joey was unconscious.
It's not charity, Joe...
What?
Ooh, I do! I do! I do!
Yeah!
Y'know, I would be offended, but Monica is freakishly strong, so...
Joey?
Ohh, so?
Oh, do you not want to?
Yeah. Oh it's not warm yet, we still have time.
Nope! Because I'm not your boyfriend. Hey Pheebs, how did it go?
...Poulet passes it up to Leetch!
Yes, how 'bout a verse of Killing Me Softly. You're gonna sneeze on my fish, aren't you?
She is now.
Could I play?
Are you serious?!
AND TO ALL A GOOD NIGHT! *Opening Credits*
Oh, oh, c'mon in.
That's great.
Well, thank you for lunch.
Uh, Joey is gonna be right back. Right back! Meanwhile, let's-let's-let's talk about you. So, you're old and small.
Hey!
Thanks. What, let me have her?! What do mean? Like if you didn't I wouldn't have a shot?
Oh, what a crappy night!
They do?
No. I'm not letting you or anybody else see, ever.
So, shouldn't we go give her the benefit of the doubt before we go...snooping around her crotch?
Okay.
Eddie, do you remember yesterday?
That's a good plan, Joe. Next time we wanna pick up women, we should just go to the park and make out. Taxi, taxi!
Okay! Okay! Let me try it again, you're gonna wanna date this next guy, I swear!
No-no-no-no! That was the joke!
I confronted her, and she didn't deny it! I don't live here!
We close escrow tomorrow, so seeing another house can only confuse us, and we're easily confused. We're not very bright.
Becasue it reminded you of the way our forefathers used to bitch at each other?
I, I know.
People do stupid things when they're upset.
Well, yeah, but y'know, what-what if I was wrong?
Coffee house?
Let her know I like her? What are you, insane? It's the next day! How needy do I want to seem? I'm right, right?
Hey hey! Where's the birthday girl?
No, no, I keep trying, y'know? I can get out, "Joey, I have too..." but then I lose my nerve and I always finish with, "...go to the bathroom." He may think I'm sick.
That sounds more fun than the thing we were going to do in Vermont!
That sounds like my first bike. My dad gave me his old one.
Uh, four, a boy, twin girls and another boy.
Well, she seems very nice and everything, but that whole thing about her coming all the way down here, just to see if I was okay? I mean,... how needy is that?
Hey, no, I've never been lower or wetter. I'll be fine. I'll just turn your, uh, bedroom into a game room or somethin', you know, put the foosball table in there.
Here, pass these, will ya..
I-never borrowed your Walkman.
One. . . two. . . two and a half. OK, just show me one of them.
Okay, I will do it. But I have to warn you; this may make me a better person and that is not the man you feel in love with!
Well I've forgotten what it tastes like okay?!
Yeah.
Y'know I think you can take her.
Damn those robots, they're supposed to be our faithful servants!
I'm sorry!
Hey, Lowell.
Yeah, come with us. You'll see how close it is to the city.
The tall girl who wouldn't sleep with you?
Hey! How'd the interview go?
Yeah.
A-huh. So he's rolling down the street and he starts to lose control, you know... maybe he falls... maybe hurts himself. Just then, a kid comes flying by wearing the shoes. He jumps over the old guy and laughs, and the line reads: "Not suitable for adults!"
Okay, I get it. So, I get nothing! Nothing here is mine! Everything here is yours! I'll get up in the morning put on your clothes, and head off to work!
'Cause it's gross.
Don't say that. Don't tangle the dream and take it away.
God, it's great to catch up! I can't believe how long it's been!
Huh-huh! You can't give her that.
Thanks man.
Now-now, why would you say that Joseph?
Well, you're gonna.
Ahh, just like the apothecary tables of yore...
Oh, that was my work laugh.
You're naked in this picture!
Noo!
Thanks.
Mm! Night Gar'!
No! We're not borrowing money.
You-you-you don't wanna give into the fear.
G'night.
Well, in spite of the yummy bagels and palpable tension, I've got pants that need to be altered.
Y'know, you'd think I would've.
Thanks Joey, that's a good idea.
Okay, you know how that people say that Tulsa is the Paris of Oklahoma?
Joey kicked me out of the car on the George Washington bridge!
Umm, not feeling better 'bout Malcom.
It's ok, it's ok. You know what? I'll just call the agency and tell them to throw out the letter.
The spoon. You licked and-and you put. You licked and you put.
What?
Joey kept screaming at me, "Do it now! Do it!! Do it! Do it now!!" Sometimes late at night I can still here the screaming.
No-no, I don't think you heard me. Are you ready to party?!
So you might say, the ring is irreplaceable?
Was his question what's more boring than him?
Oh that's all right fellas, I saw a kitchen this morning - on TV. Stop talking. OK.
Ooh, I hate when my father calls me that.
Oh-oh, yeah, and did he also say that ah, some of the dialogue was corny and that he actually found it was funny and not sexy?
I said art lover.
Well this one's for you.
Let's call 'em.
Okay, on three. One....Two....
I used to undress my cousin Glenn.
Of course it is. Wow-whoa!
Hey.
Yes.
Wouldn't that be Frank the III?
What? What? What?
Look, we can't stay in here forever.
Look, we have no time okay? We must focus. We gotta get everything back into its original place.
Do you even remember which part of the wall is not spackle?
Hey.
Did your Dad ever dress up like Santa?
I know.
Yep, I'm in a tree.
No.
Richard was there so I couldn't do it!
No, we'd just like to close them.
Does anybody know me?!
Why would she use them with Richard and not me? I can be kinky! I once did a naked dance for her... with scarves!
Obviously.
I married Fred Sanford!
Yes that would have made more sense.
We share a wall! So either he's great in bed, or she just likes to agree with him a lot.
I didn't realize that.
Wow, Heckles was voted class clown, and so was I. He was right. Would you listen to that?
Oh my God!
What are you looking at me for? I didn't know that.
Yeah, this more than anything else, is the staging area.
Buh-bye. I just got us reservations at Michelle's and tickets to the Musicman to celebrate our first holiday season as a betroughed couple.
I'm not Jewish, so...
Hey! What are you guys doing?
BEND OVER?!!!
Okay, the old hug and roll.
Are you serious?
Uh, Joey's having an embolism, but I'd go for a Nip, y'know?
You're right, I know.
Y'know what? You can say goodbye to the tan ones.
Listen, if you want to borrow money, its kind of a bad time. I'm buying dinner for 128 people tomorrow night.
Oh. You mind if I join you?
Oh. Y'know, that night meant a lot to me too, and it wasn't because I was in a bad place or anything, it just meant a lot to me 'cause, you're really hot! Is that okay?
BEND OVER?!!!
Hey Bobby.
I have the lung capacity of a two year old.
I know, but just let me say it.
Well, maybe it's a contest, y'know? Like, collect all five?
Oh no-no-no!
I can't believe it. Paolo kissed my mom?
What is it?
Hey.
What's going on?
Didn't you used to call it the Little Major?
My wife and I have some boundary issues, you know, sometimes we ask inappropriate questions. We're working on it.
So, the fact that I am a doctor, and my wife's a reverend, that's important to you?
Oh yeah.
Oh no nonononononnononono, don't go..
Oh, he's in the back. The duck pissed him off, said that eggs came first.
Okay.
Oh, my, god!
I think it's great. Y'know, it's sweet, it's romantic...
Yeah! All right! You go first.
Well, I could make it seem like he's here. "Here's some little known facts about cous-cous. They didn't add the second cous until 1979."
Rhythm?
It's my game. You want the job or not?
Well y'know, they only give you three letters, so after A-S-S it is a bit of a challenge.
I know. *He* always wanted to be the first black man to cross the Atlantic.
I thought...maybe...you got me porn for Valentine's Day.
Is that a hint? Because we love you Doctor Connelly but we don't think we'd want you to be our child! Wow, talking about an inhospitable environment!
There just don't happen to be any women in our games.
Maybe. Unless they're like two people who have lived in apartments next to each other for years, and then one day they're pushed through a vagina and they meet.
Is there any chance you didn't see that?
You're gonna put on sweats and clean, aren't you?
Yes, and I have to say, I am not just hurt. I am insulted. When I tell somebody I did something...
Listen Eddie, um, I've been thinking about our current living situation and uh, why are you smiling?
Hey!
Listen to me!!
Oh that's great! Right there! Can we get some of that over here please? There we go.
There you go.
Here just...take this.
No?
Okay! This is it! We're gonna get married!
Sounds good to me... but what would a guy think?
Well get rid of her, obsessive and shrill.
No. This is just part of a dare devil game that I play called 'wait until the last moment before I burst and die.'
Hey, does anybody need anything copied? I'm going down to the Xerox place.
I think.... I think I can see your scalp.
Okay, great.
What?
Mine was a humdinger.
No, no no no. You'll be fine. Hillary's bind, right?
How come?
Oh! It's on! It's on!
Big dog?
Maybe not even then.
I'm gonna hold him a different way. Look I don't understand, if you hated it so much, why did you buy it in the first place?
Sure. Ummm. What's up?
That means nothing to me. Come on!
Okay.
Knock, knock.
I'm sorry! Hey-hey Joe, why don't you uh, lift up your shirt? Take a look at this kiddo. We have a crying child! Roll the damn cameras!
Oh, no, no, no dear God, no!
You're welcome, sweetheart.
Hi, oh hi.
You should be. You're really on top of stuff..
Hey it's Joey!
Well, of course I do! My good friend Joey over here.
Here in Chelsea.
Hi.
You don't say anything.
Please, just do it!
Pheebs!!
Okay!!!!!
Hey!!!
Nice going, imp. OK, it's OK. All I need to do is reach over and put it in my mouth.
I don't know, but Donald Trump wants his blue blazer black.
Uh, yeah.
I can't help it!
Oh my God! Who's gonna watch that?!
We're going to Everest! Okay, it would be nice to leave an ass print on Everest!
Yeah, I've been there my friend.
Well, we could count again.
Yeeeeahhhh.
Okay, I accept that. When Janice asked me and I said no, she took that to mean that I was calling her a cow.
Are you trying to get everybody divorced?
One more game?
I get pedicures!
No-no, I mean what, what's this about your new place?
And last but not least.
I have no idea.
That's great.
Hey Phoebe! Fatty!
How do ya do.
Oh, so that's this is gonna work now? You're just gonna order me around all the time?
I don't think that's exactly...
What gay thing?
It's like a baby caterpillar chasing its mama!
Hey, look Joey, I'm just saying if you need something to hold you over, I can get you a job right here as an entry level processor.
What are you talking about? The couch is perfectly in line with the carpet. And then I can just walk over here and casually just put my feet right up on the... OK, OK, here's what we do, we just uh, move the couch closer to the coffee table.
Well it's very unsettling.
I can't belive it.
I can't remember which sister.
But the Kit-Kats are all right?!
During this time...are you, are you still my best man?
That's... That's was...
My God! He wants to do it with Phoebe in London!
Fine! Maybe I will too!
Y'know what maybe it's gonna be okay, I mean it's been a week.
I'm not crazy about babies. I'm crazy about us.
I told you I should not wear this color.
Yeah, I just got uh, got plans.
No, no, no, no, no!
That's just a lot of big talk, y'know.
Okay, for the last time. It's not named for each individual man.
Well this is great. Y'know, those cameras were the only thing that was gonna cheer Monica up today, she's really depressed.
Bye.
Yeah! Okay, go, go, go get him.
'kay, look: Can we just drop this? I'm not gonna smoke again.
I mean I was nothing before you. Call the other girls and ask. Which wouldn't take long. But when I'm with you, and we're together, OH...MY...GOD.
Alright, so I'm back in high school, I'm standing in the middle of the cafeteria, and I realize I am totally naked.
I was not ready for this today!
You really think that is what he meant?
That's me.
Would you get that please? People have been calling to congratulate me all day.
No! In his office! How many kisses were there?
Y'know when we move in together, can I get a gumball machine?
OK, well that's the part where I'm a wank. But I was hoping we wouldn't focus on that. Hey, c'mon man, I said I was sorry like a hundred times, I promise I will never take it off my. . . wrist. But if, if you want to stay in there and be mad, you know, you just uh, you stay in there.
Y'know what? There's some nice guys at my office, do you want me to set you up?
Whoa-whoa-whoa! You broke Joey's chair?
What picture?
Because you know how competitive you get and well, I say it's cute, others disagree, and I'm lying!
God, I'm exhausted.
Okay, how'd it go at the doctor's?
Uh, credit card. Oh no! No-no, but I left my credit card with Joey. Okay, I'll go get it. You guard the ring.
Of course I'm awake. Assume from now on that I'm always awake!
Okay. Here's a question you never have to ask. My dad just called and wanted to know if he could borrow one of your pearl necklaces.
Well what did it do?
Well, there are other ways of winning back your money, how about a little uh, a little Blackjack?
No. I mean I believe that uh, certain people are more suited for each other and I believe in falling in love, but soul mates, I don't think they exist.
What?
Stop talking, stop talking now. Let me just get this straight. You're actually stealing my hat?
Is this the best way to use one of your three magic wishes?
Hey.
Fine!
Well, you're not suggesting that we spend all of the money on the wedding?
Uhm, thank you, but we're really trying not to get our hopes up.
Sir, can I ask you to umm, could you...hold out that ring and ask me to marry you?
Okay.
Love your condoms my man.
Hey.
...also I was the point person on my company's transition from the KL-5 to GR-6 system.
I'll take this one too Uh ... Mommy?
Are you really that busy?
Alright look, let's think about this, ok, do you really think that people are gonna stir up your family at this tragic time? That people are gonna post condolences on a website? This is not about people not caring that you're dead .This is about people not having a decent outlet for their grief.
Yeah, we talked and Monica made me see that I over reacted a little bit and some things in life are more important.
One more score to go! You can do it!
Mike didn't tell you? You have to chose one of us to be in your wedding. One of his groomsmen fell out.
I see you later! end.
Well it's just my entire family was run out of Scotland by...Vikings. Anyway, lots of bad memories.
Ahh, so how many cameras are actually on you?
And you're okay with that?
I got that!
No, we only went out once.
Thank you, Ross.
Ooh, she's asleep, that means we can...
No, Stephen Hurs was the kid who would eat anything for money, David Stein was the guy who had no elbows.
So, Spock actually hugs his father?
With extra pulp?
At least he died doing what he loved... watching blimps.
It kills over one americans every year.
Nooo!! She's really dull! And she gets this gross mascara goop thing in the corner of her eye!
Okay. Well, I think the centerpieces are too big
That's me! Come on!
Honey, you remember my boss Doug right?
Y'know, I don't know if you've ever looked up the term goofing around in the dictionary... Well, I have, and the technical definition is, two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just wanna spend more time together. But if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me, then we have to, y'know, get you my original dictionary. I am so bad at this.
I'll tell you at the wedding.
Hey, listen, why don't we go change in my room?
You're damn right I'm right. I say you show this guy what you're made of. I say you stand your ground. I say you show him that you are the baddest hombre west of the lingerie.
I'm so tired. Yeah okay, but no foreplay.
It's just that we bought a hibachi together, and then he ran off and got married, and things got pretty ugly.
Yeah. We don't feel like we can host Thanksgiving this year.
You have gotta stop!
Why?
I turned it off. Mother of God, I turned it off!
You're not gonna need my help?
Really!
Were you there?
Work people? Nobody told me.
