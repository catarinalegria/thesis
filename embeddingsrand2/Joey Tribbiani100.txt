Relax okay, I-I-I can get this open. Anybody have a coat hanger?
Yeah, just a crush! That's all this is! It's a crush! I'm Joey; I don't get deep feelings.
Well, okay, I'll - I'll just call her and tell her the date's cancelled, and find him somebody else.
Yeah. Yeah, so what? Look, I live across the street, and I know all about you and your little telescope, and I don't appreciate it, okay? Yeah, I can see you right now! Hello! If I wanna walk around my apartment in my underwear, I shouldn't have to feel like Thank you, but... that's not really the point... The point is that... Mostly free weights, but occasionally..
I'll take it back tomorrow.
A dreamless sleep.
And?
Hey! So?
Finally!
Chandler, I didn't kiss her, he did! See what happens when you break the code?
Yeah, unless you hook up with a bunch of pigeons.
Yeah, yeah, and the Indians taught the Pilgrims what it meant to be hot in the new world!
It's my house-warming present for Monica and Chandler.
What kind of profit is that?! And you call yourself an accountant.
You're mean!
Yeah, what are ya gonna do?
You fell asleep!! There was no kangaroo! They didn't take any of my suggestions! That's for coming buddy. I'll see you later.
Chandler! I don't need luck. I have thought this through!
Likewise. Uh, I'll take that. It's what I came for. So, this is new. Where'd you two meet?
I'm the lead in Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.!!
No, no!
Done.
So that's why I feed my dog Purina One! Pick up a bag today!
Oh, hey, you guys are finally gonna get to meet Kate!
Oh, here's where I win all my money back!
All right, all we need is a little lighter fluid.
What!? But I already bought my ticket to Bermuda!
G-sharp.
Hi!
I do! So much! I can't stop thinking about her! I can't sleep, I-
What? Mine aren't tinted.
Luck!
Because... look, no one wants this to happen more than me, ok? I have gone over this moment in my head a hundred times and not once did I ever say no! I couldn't do it to Ross!
Are you kidding me? I'm great! Yeah, I'm uh; I'm better than great. I am good. And now that she's gone, I can uh, I can do all this stuff around here that I couldn't do before. Y'know? Like umm, I can walk around naked again. Y'know? I can uh, I can watch porn in the living room. Right? This is uh, this is good for me. Y'know? I like being on my own, I'm uh, better off this way. I'm uh, a lone wolf. Y'know? A loner. Alone. All alone. Forever. What's a wolf got to do to get a huh around here?!
So you uh, nervous about getting married?
Get out.
Did I get it?
No, never done that either.
Thanks, you are such a good friend. And this is so weird.
Uhhh, Phoebe and Joey.
I don't know. You uh, you got something for me?
Okay, I guess it doesn't seem that weird.
Now that you're a couple, we don't get two presents from you guys?
So, Ross and Rachel got married, Monica and Chandler almost got married, do you think you and I should hook up?
Okay, but I don't see you asking any other paying customers to put on aprons.
Hey!
How is it you?
You may be a sissy but I'll still . All right, it hurts so bad, I could only let her do oneeyebrow and now... they don't match!
Yeah.
But Phoebe, wait! Wait! Phoebe. Phoebe!
Yeah.
Great, I'm finished! In fact, I just dropped it off at the agency.
Oooh, what you got there?
Not following you.
Right!"Oh my God, is this the men's room? Oh, I feel so foolish, have you always known you wanted to be an actor?"
Oh, women can. You can't.
There you go! That's the spirit I'm looking for! What can we do? Huh? All right who's first? Huh? Ross?
Occupation? Dinosaurs.
Wait a second, I see what you're trying to do here! You-you're trying to give me money again!
Alright, so...so tell me one of your moves.
Okay. Sorry about that... Uh, so where's C.H.E.E.S.E.?
Pheebs come on! Bunny vs. Doody! We're waiting! Okay. Okay guys, one match, winner take all. Oh wait-wait! What does the winner get?
You got it! And the rabbi's beard, 100% horsehair. Nice catch C.H.E.E.S.E.! It's your line C.H.E.E.S.E.! Wayne! Wayne!!
Jan-ice. 'Cause I, just, I feel bad for Ross, you know, we-we always go together, we're like the three hocke-teers.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. You just want to put it on your hand!
Fine.
Will you wear a thong?
See ya! All right Pheebs, I am ready for my first lesson.
You don't say.
Yeah-yeah right. That's okay. That's fine. That's uh, pretty much what I was expecting. So uh, it's no big deal. All right? I think I'm gonna go.
Hey, I was pretty close. Uhh, so bad news. Umm, I can't buy the boat, I don't have any money.
Wow! Maybe uh, maybe you and I ought to get to know each other a little better.
Look, we were way out of line, we totally support you.
... It's a fertility study.
Hmm. Do you sleep with women and never call them again?
I said I think you're hot and now I'm embarrassed.
Hey, how much did you guys tip the super this year?
Because, Monica, the guy's so good, and I really, really want this part.
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Slow down, you go way too fast. Ok? Just go back to the MET, ok?
Huh.
Yeah, she's been in there all day , uh high fever, a nose problem... Phlegm! Phlegm! Phlegm-phlegm-phlegm!
Hey Mr. and Mrs. Geller! Let me help you with that.
That just cost me four bucks. But uh listen, I just called to see how the chick and the duck are doing?
Consider it done.
Ohh, I know one thing!
Oh that's on the house courtesy of Joey Tribbiani.
No. It just seems like Ross is the kind of a guy that would marry a woman on the verge of being a lesbian and then push her over the edge.
I need something sweet.
Nothing!
But this is a two line part, it's like takin' a step backwards. I'm not gonna do this.
I would say, "Woman, please!"
It's a rented tux. Okay. I'm not gonna go commando in another man's fatigues.
I'm sure he's not more bummed out than I am.
Thanks.
Girls say it to me all the time! And believe me, if she's anything like me, she's just gonna be relieved.
Wow! This girl is good.
Oh yeah. Well you can't fire Joseph. You know why, 'cause he's not in your department.
Hey!
Well I tried, but people kept coming in and then you took your breast out!
Who's that dirty old lady?
