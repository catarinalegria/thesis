What?
No, my parents are rich.
Uh-huh.
Huh.
Hey, it's everybody.
Oh honey, I think I'm having one too!
You think you can knock up my daughter and then not marry her?! I'm gonna kill you!!
I'm gonna be really late for dance class!
Isn't this great?!
Oh, shoot, we gotta go, got a reservation in 30 minutes.
It was nice to meet you Rachel.
Well, I believe that the answers lie in the osteological evidence. I plan to begin there.
Oh, that's better then.
Namaste.
Aaaahhhhhhh.
Yeah, sure. Good luck!
And I'm his friend, Dr.Rosen.
Hi! Hi sweetheart! This is my husband Sid, I don't think you've met him. Ross, Rachel, this is Sid. I nabbed him a year ago at the dermatologist's office. Thank God for adult acne huh?
Nice shot.
Ah, just one other thing.
It's just her water breaking. Calm down, will you?
Ooohhh.
Alll right, we'll call you in a few minutes.
I'd love an ice water.
Yeah!
Five dollars a box.
I wish I could.
Oh my God!
I can't believe you married him.
There's no way he smells, he's the only one around here with a shower in his dressing room.
Why don't we do a trial run.
And wait, I've got something for you.
Here are the boards for Friday's pitch .
It's not a game Ross, a woman died on my table today.
Hi!
No, you've got to whip it.
Why don't I remember this dog?
No, that's not it. So, you're a soap actor? Well this must be pretty exciting for you to be in a real play, hmm?
We can have any future you want.
Oh my God! Someone cut Howard's cake! Who would do a think like that?
Are you talking about me?
Is that an expensive blouse?
Can't you see what's going on here, this man is dead.
Joey...
Ross? That opens my cervix.
Okay. I-But I think we should still have this conversation.
Actually, me too.
I can hear you through the ceiling. My cats cant sleep.
Well that wasn't easy.
Oh, thanks for the tip.
And then we've gotta get some sleep.
Well, you don't have that much time to relax. The other one will be along in a minute.
...but when all is said and done, he still drinks out of the mugs.
That's so great for you guys!
But, he told me over the phone.
Nothin' roomie, just watchin' you sleep.
Ready?
Ross, are you okay?
Excuse me?
But Rachel I thought she just had a baby with Ross.
Maybe.
That's just halftime, there's more of this.
No I distinctly remember you were dodging her calls and trying to avoid seeing her.
A real doctor?
Oh-ho, I think it's nice.
I haven't slept in four years!
Oh please, a relationship.
Hey! You're in a play! I didn't know you could dance! You had a beard!
Push, push!
I brought something that I want to give you, assuming of course that you want it.
Cut! That was great everybody! Thank you!
I'm also allergic to peanuts, and cashews, and almonds, and filberts...
Actually, he is getting closer on the talking thing. He can't quite say mama yet, but once he said yumen.
Waitwait.. we talking about the coyotes here? All right, a cow got through!
Rachel... I heard you guys whispering.
OK. You better. Oh God, here we go. Hey wanna see 'em go nuts? Watch this. Who needs glasses?
Okay, I'll see you at the station later.
All right, I'm leaving! Because I'm not going to spend one more day with someone whose out to sabotage my every move. That's you Rachel!
Do you?
Oh, yeah! Let's do it!
I want one.
I don't know. Maybe maybe low self-esteem, maybe maybe to compensate for overshadowing a sibling, maybe you...
Well um, why don't you call me in 20 years and tell me if you're still upset about this.
Right. He's not angry at the room either. Try it again, he owns it! He owns the room. It is his. He owns, owns, owns, owns the room! He owns it!! All right, it's a little weird, but it's getting better. Oh well, I'm gonna miss this woman so much. I don't know what I'm going to do! I mean, it's been 20 years of my life.
Which bedroom do ya want it in Miss Geller?
I don't want to talk about it.
Do you?
I'm sorry.
Hey! I got a kid starting college. I've to get surgery on my knee, you just lost me ten grand!
Bye!
I didn't realize that she was so close.
Each.
Two pounds of Moca Java please.
The sexy blonde behind the counter.
Oh, hi, darling!
Oh, I'll be right back. And, uh, I know it's really not my place, but please don't name your child Phoebo.
Please, can't you help me out?
Plate?
Hey, what are you doing here?
I'm really fine, don't worry, I'm great with children. Gavin Mitchell. Pleased to meet you.
