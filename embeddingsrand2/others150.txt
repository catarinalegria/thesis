We took a road trip to Las Vegas man.
Well, I bet you are all thinkin' "Now would be a really great time for an intermission", huh?
Now if you just pay me my three hundred dollars, I'll be on my way!
Obviously.
Well, I've... I've been blessed with a... a lot of great roles.
See, about a month ago, I wanted to hurt you. More than I've ever wanted to hurt anyone in my life. And I'm an orthodontist.
Well I guess on some level I always knew I was straight. I though I was supposed to be something else, you know, I'm an ice dancer, all my friends are gay, I was just tryin' to fit in.
So, I think you're boxes are over here.
No, it really should be burgundy.
Now it also says here that you lied about your sexual preference before marriage?
I love the way you look every night Chandler! That's why I made you this tape! Happy Birthday! Love Janice!
And he was my best student.
Oh, excellent.
Ross, there is absolutely no way this is going to come off unless you start to...
Wh...
Hey you know what, this kid needs me, okay? She needs to have a cool fun aunt!
Five dollars a box.
What? Oh my God, there's really money in here.
So what. I say, punch him.
Could you also tell them I'm skinny now?
Oh my god, there's an unattractive nude man playing the cello.
When I'm in a relationship, I love having a girlfriend.
Sorry I'm late, what's up?
Sorry. But just one last thing. Y'know you came looking for family. I'm family, I'm it. Now, now I'm done.
On the date, I will be able to talk to her directly? See ya Friday.
No. You?
Can we talk to you for just a y'know... It's just a little thing. Well we think it's absolutely marvelous that you're having this baby out of wedlock, some of our friends are less open-minded. Which is why we've told them all that you're married.
We got the grant. Three years, all expenses paid.
Oh my God, you're the sister!
The Waltham Residence.
So you look like you're doing really well! I guess you're mugging days are behind you?
Well, I'm still sorry. Is he here?
Whaddyou mean?
'Cause every time I see your face, I can't help but fall from grace. I know.....
You too, you let uh, your hair grow long.
No, no, no, she's nice but, y'know, it just it made me realize that I'm just not, I'm just not ready to be dating, y'know?
So ah, there was this thing I wanted to talk to you about.
Yay!!
Not so fast Wesley!
Wow! That's ah, that's pretty nice!
The wedding! There's going to be a wedding. Young lady, don't you sit there and tell me my first grandchild is going to be a bastard! Rachel Karen Green, tell me there is gonna be a wedding!!
Yeah. Y'know we-we talked about just living together, but um, we want to have kids right away.
Happy?! Is that what I'm supposed to be Vic? Happy?
Um, leave.
Not on purpose, he ricocheted of you and got me.
No.
Hi sweetie!
I can't believe you really walk alone here! I mean, you hear such stories about New York.
So, the Etch-a-Sketch is from you guys?
So, you wanna get a hamburger or something?
Umm, yeah, actually, Susan's gonna be home any minute, it's kinda an anniversary.
Oh Ross...
Excuse me. Doesn't this come with a side salad?
Oh no. I thought you said they could shoot the spot without you.
Uh, like, could these margaritas be any stronger? Hey, Chandler.
Well, welcome to the Winner Circle. Joey and Gene, you guys ready?
All you need is a woman who likes men and you'll be set.
Some guys are just lucky I guess.
Ross and Emily have made their declarations and it gives me great pleasure to declare them husband and wife.
Yeah, we are.
Oh, wow. I can't believe you're throwing that in my face.
Oh, my.
It's probably because not mature enough. Or smart enough. Maybe he doesn't like the way I dress-No that can't be it. It's really gotta be the smart thing. Oh I'm so stupid! I'm just like this incredibly pretty stupid girl!
Hi.
Ohh!
That's tough. Tough stuff. C'mon, Pheebs, we're gonna catch that movie, we gotta get going.
When I was six years old.
Come on!
Hang on a second. I'll-I'll talk to you in the morning. I'm sorry what?
So? What do you think?
So beautiful.
Good bye Ross.
Hello? It's not gonna be Helen Geller.
Good morning Rachel.
Thank you.
No, of course we're not.
Well, it's getting late, I've got to get to the game, so I'm gonna... head.
Oh yeah, yeah uh, it's down the hall and uh, second door to your left.
It's a bathing suit?
Mr. Geller.
Wow!
My friend Manny. I asked him to keep me away from you.
Yeah? Well you still shoulda told me.
Oh!
Hi!
Well hi, I'm Jenny Boone. I'm the new teacher here.
I can write an epic poem about this lip.
I never should have broken up with you. I think about you all the time. I mean, do you ever still think about me?
Hi sweetie. Hi, can I talk to you for a second?
I gotta tell you, you look great now.
Hey, anybody want to meet a hero?
I wonder if its time for you to rejoin our team at the museum?
Or so I would have you believe.
Hi honey.
Umm, Ginger's gonna take over this corner.
Oh I-I remember you.
That's the one.
Okay, I'll see you at the station later.
Okay, we'll give a call if anything comes up.
Yeah, and I have a time share in the Pocanos with Flipper.
I think you should give him your star.
Well that's not a third nipple.
Sorry, there's just more room out here.
What?! Why?!
Really?! Well see? I never knew about her.
May I help you?
All right. Well, there you go. Stop it, stop it, stop it.
... and then, at the end of the commercial, the girls get out of the hut tub and start making out with each other!
Only if you'll be Phoebe Buffay.
Well, it was nice meeting you.
Hello Tilly.
Champagne?
Eric!! Let's go!!
I don't know anything about music, but I think you're really, really great.
So, why did you break up?
Or I'll hear you.
Oh, it's nothing. I went on a date with a guy who lived in this building and it didn't end very well.
A doctor at this hospital?
Oh no.
Tell me.
Very busy.
Hey Monica, it's Chip.
By the way, do you know who's moving back into town? Tom and Sue's daughter Jen.
You never told me about that guy on your sweet sixteen. Oh, ugh. I'm sorry about that.
Well that sounds simple enough, let's just do that.
Yeah.
Yeah. I can just go home and get back at him by myself.
No, I'm getting three separate heartbeats.
Why? Where are you going?
Goodbye.
You're married more than once?
Well, the guy's worked here for 25 years.
Sabrina. I know about you two. I saw you today kissing in the doctor's lounge.
There's something I never told you Amber. I'm actually your half- brother.
Yeah, get out! Now!
Yeah, you can melt art. Hey, can I use your phone?
Hi!
Hey!
I almost forget the tickets, didn't I?
Oh my God! I'm your groupie!
Well, if we learned one thing today C.H.E.E.S.E. is that cheerleaders and high explosives don't mix.
Phoebe's right Frank. I know it's hard to hear, but it would've been wrong to go through with it. I-I-I was being selfish, even though we, we want the same things now, in the future we may not. Is that it, is that what it is?
Yeah, it was my first date since the uh, since the divorce.
Bing! Read your Computech proposal, a real homerun. Ooh. Barely got ya that time, get over here. Come on. Wham! Good one. That was a good one. Keep at it team.
You two were married?!
What?
Oh yeah yeah, thank God you were here to oversee all the kissing!
What?!
A couple of hours, I feel awful.
By the way, Chandler. I cut you out of all my pictures. So if you want, I have a bag with just your heads.
