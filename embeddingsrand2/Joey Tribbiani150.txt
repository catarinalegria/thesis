Uh-uh, excuse me, I do have to interrupt on Ross's behalf. I-I think the rule applies here y'know, since she has a chance to get on broad back...
Aw, I know all about Kip!
Oooh.
Now it just hit her that she's leaving and she's kind of emotional so no one say anything to set her off, ok?
Uh, actually, that's..
You guys kissed! Oh my-this is huge!
Look, which one of us is gonna be having sex in there, me or you?
And Chandler I can't believe I let you pay for this one. Thanks man.
Hey, if she were marrying a guy, she'd be like the worst lesbian ever.
Hey-hey.
Yeah, like you could find something as sophisticated as this.
Of course I did.
Arg... Alright, I'll take care of it. Monica and Chandler come through the front door.
That-that is a good trick.
Okay that's the green stuff talkin'.
What?
Well yeah, don't-don't you think it's a she?
Yeah, yeah, they must have jumped off the table, 'cause now they're gone!
Yeah! And hey, thanks for coming with me. And thanks again for helping me take a shower.
Yeah! Okay.
Uh no Rach, he's gone. But listen, he told us what happened and it does, it sounds like an honest mistake.
Yeah right after we stole his lunch money and gave him a wedgie. What's the matter with you, he's parking the car.
Yeah, I just... I just feel bad about firing Estelle. This is got to be killing her.
Joseph Stalin. I think you'd remember that!
We're gonna climb Mt. Everest!
I'd be lying if I said I haven't thought about it myself. Chandler is my best friend, it would be wrong. Good......But wrong.
Definitely!
Didn't I tell ya? Always showin' off.
Really? It sounds exactly the same to me.
That's fire. Beats everything.
Bye.
You sure? Some extra crispy? Dirty rice? Beans?
PUSH! PUSH! PUSH!
Okay.
Sa-sa-saw!
I don't know. It's-it's just...lately, I've been feeling... Okay, here's what it is... You know what? I feel a lot better, thanks!
Hey, cut him some slack. It was Chandler's idea.
Well Ross was hangin' out over at our place, Rachel comes over to borrow some moisturiser from Chandler....
All right, so. How did it go at the fertility clinic?
I've got Ben.
Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman.
Feminist issue. That's where I went!
Monica, have you ever been with him when he wasn't drinking?
Seriously, Ross, you don't want in on this?
This is unbelievable Phoebs, how can you be married?
Hey!!
Dude-dude, who would you rather have kiss your sister, me or Chandler?
Y'know what I mean, about how I'm always going out with all these women. And I always figured, when the right one comes along, I'd be able to be a stand-up guy and go the distance, y'know? Now I'm looking at my dad, thinking...
Anyway, it uh...look it'll just...take me a while to get over her, that's all. I'm not even sure how to do that, I mean I've never been in love before so...
Well, this is awkward.
What are you ah, what are you gonna do?
Okay.
No, only for sex.
Hey listen guys, we feel really terrible.
Oh, hey, how about this? Wanna be an extra on my show?
Maybe he's. . . gay.
No, but I'm gonna!
I'll take it!
You got it!
Are you strippers?
All right, watch me! Okay, you time me. Ready?
Nothing, he's just really believes in that.
Yeah, the Knicks rule all!
Hey!
Sure, no problem. Ooh-Hey, donuts!
I'm sorry! This never happened to me before! I'm an expert at taking off bras! I can do it with one hand! I can do it with my eyes closed! One time I just looked at one, and it popped open! I blame your bra!
So ah, Phoebe tells us you write jingles.
Well, I'm just-if the paste matches the pants, you can make yourself a pair of paste pants and she won't know the difference!
Thank you!
Hey, excuse me, would you mind switching with me?
Food? Uh-huh gimme!
Yeah, o-o-o-o-okay anyway, I just wanted to say I'm sorry. Here.
How many times do I have to tell you! Ya, turn and sliiiide! Y'know, turn and slide.
Hey!
Yeah. All right, now give me your best shot.
Wow, it's really long.
Oh, you know what you should do? You should walk all the way at the top of Statue of Liberty.
I'm sorry! Okay? I went down to the gift shop and it's either this or a bathrobe! Look, what's more important, the way I'm dressed or me being with you on your special day?
Hi I'm Joey. This is Chandler.
Hey!
Yep! There's always room for Jell-O...
Really. And what do you mean you never have fun anymore? You have fun with me, remember that time we saw those strippers and you paid me 50 bucks to eat that book?
Which goes where?
Oh sure, right back there.
But it happens? I'm gotta go to the bathroom.
Hey.
Hey everybody, look who's here! You remember my grandmother!
Will you let the lady talk?!
Say it... say it!
Ugh! I don't know what I'm going to do! I called the company that sent and th-they don't care! Then I called 9-1-1 and they laughed at me, if this isn't an emergency, then what is?
Hey.
Nice!
All right, I guess this will be fine.
Im sayin I see a difference.
Shhhh!
Ross..
What? My hands are totally clean, I just gave the duck a bath.
Actually, I really need.
I really made you think about that thing uh?
Why don't I take you out?
Pretty good. It's like you said. It's mostly just putting numbers from one column into another column.
Hey. Man, it is so hard to shop for girls.
Whoa.
How ya doin'?
Oh-whoa-hey, dude, what are you doing?!
I love living with you so much. I just wish things didn't have to change.
What's up buddy?
We good? Yeah? Good? Once again, I pronounce you husband and wife. Now kiss her again.
Your eyebrows look weird.
Is that college talk for horny?
Don't interrupt me when I'm talkin' to God! Now where were we? Oh right, okay. Do you Dina, take this man...
Hello.
Am I in it?
You know what it is? It's a nice place but I gotta see I don't know if I see myself living here. Oh, oh, oh, let me see... Yeah, I could see it.
Oh we flipped for it. I got the cigar, he got the moustache. Figured if we both grew it, we'd look like dorks.
Felicity and I, we're watching My Giant, and I was thinking, "I'm never gonna be as good an actor as that giant." Do you think I'm just wasting my life with this acting thing?
You'll tell me later?
Okay.
Thank you. Wait-wait-wait-wait, you see me again. Hang on, the guy's butt's blockin' me. There I am, there I am, there I am, there I am, there I am...
You can come over and watch the Super Bowl. Every year, all right?
Yeah, you do!
Erectus?
IN LONDON!!!
Well, not that its any of your business, but, no, we havent, okay?
Have you heard about a little something called, Not Making Girls Cry.
All right I'll talk in code. Remember when the kid sees those two blanks in the hallway?
All right Chandler, you're up.
What?!!
All right, let's go Pheebs.
So are you gonna start taking this thing seriously?
Wow! I'm so sorry; I had no idea it would bother you this much.
By someone besides Monica?
Me pooh pooh!
Hey! What's up?
Yeah, in a poem maybe.
No, no, my mouth says the words, my brain is thinking monster trucks!
Soon, soon, I'm gonna be on soon. There I am!
No-no-no, please-please Chandler I-I-I would owe you so much!
Uhm... Aren't you a little overdressed?
No! No! No! For my new fridge-our new fridge!
Rachel... let's be clear on this, ok? I do not love Hugsy. I like him a normal amount...
Yeah?
Uh, uh, we'll flip for it. Ducks or clowns.
That's great. Thanks Rach.
Oh, now I have to go!!
Glove salesman!
Oh, Chandler.
Just... seeing what it'd be like to be a paleontologist... it's fun, yeah!
Your sister stood me up the other night.
Oh my God! Those are almost right on the floor!
