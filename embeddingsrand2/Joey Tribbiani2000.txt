Oh, yeah. Yeah. Let her dangle.
No! It's not okay! It's not okay at all!! You're dead inside!!
Yeah! I'm fine! Thanks! Hey Rach, how you doin'?
All right! Thanks! You're the best! Now listen, the last day of auditions is Thursday. Okay? So I gotta get in there by Thursday. Okay? Just remember Thursday. Thursday. Can you remember Thursday?
Cage closed?
Pheebs, you can't do that. The casting director doesn't talk to friends, she only talks to agents.
All right. Let's get the contestants out of their isolation booths. And they're off!
What?! That's not fair! It's not my fault! I was off with my bride's maid! And who's to say I would've even said yes?! I mean I would've said yes. Chandler look y-y-you are making way to big a deal out of this, all right? Look, everything worked out okay!
Hit me.
Ow!
Hello.
What happened? What happened?
Ooh! Ah! Okay!
Nope. Op, wait! There he goes.
Pretty nice?
Rach?
No, no, no, don't get up, I got a cooler right here.
Me too. Alright, whattaya got.
All right.
Hey, listen you ah....
Phoebe, could you do me a favour? Could you try this on? I just wanna make sure it fits.
Look, does someone mind switching to sit with Charlie?
Man With Eye Patch! You get in there and you do your job.
No, eh, oh-oi, easy, it's not a hot dog!
Yep, that's my audition.
Nah, it's okay. Right, Gunther?
Yeah you see umm, well, I'm an actor. Right? So I gotta keep my emotions right at the surface y'know? See what I'm saying? I gotta lot of balls in the air. Y'know what I mean? It's tough! Guys like me, y'know, you wander around, you're alone...
What, what are you doing? What are you doing?
Bye-bye!
Look at you, all sweet and innocent, sleeping like an angel... with Emma's chubby little hands wrapped around ya. It's okay, Emma, you stay asleep.
Yeah, I can dance, y'know.
I think were not wearing the same shirt anymore!!
Okay, is there anything else?
Well, it's always nice to meet the fans.
Great. Then you'll be able to spend more quality time with your real friends, the spoons.
You are dogged man! I totally fit!
We're now in the ceremony, Monica is about to say, "I do" when her drunk uncle starts yelling. What do you do? Go!
I gotta go check something over here.
That's it! Thanks Pheebs!
That's not food...No, I don't, no... Everything's different here...I want to go home. I...I miss my family. I miss the coffee house. I can't even remember what Phoebe looks like.
So let me get this straight. If you go with Bonnie tonight, you're doing the smart, healthy thing and moving on.
Yeah, that guy really hurt us.
We broke down on the Parkway, so I have to walk back and get some transmission fluid. And hey, listen could you please tell Kathy that I'll be there as soon as I can.
Yeah, here we are. Uhh... I... I think I'm...falling in love with you.
Hey!!
Hey, I gotta! Unless...
Oh, you have no idea. And-and when we're on stage I get to-to kiss her and-and touch her, but then she goes home with the director, and it's like somebody's ripping out my heart!
I just want you to say it once in a while.
You want to see her again, right?
Hey, you know, some of those are pretty hard! Like why would there be a ghost in my fridge? . Yeah!
Well, I've been thinking about this whole commercial thing, y'know me going up against Ben, the two of us competing, and that can't lead to anything good. So, I think I'm just gonna step aside. I'm gonna tell them that I won't audition.
I'm on top of the world, looking down on creation and the only explanation I can find...
Err... Kind of.
Fake? Excuse me? Hello?
You stepped on my egg roll?
Hey! What are you guys doing here? I thought you'd be out partying with Gandel-worf.
Hey you too!
Cool.
Wow! Yeah I ah, I gave up a job too.
Forget about it.
Whew! Stood up to fast, got a little head rush.
Wait, wait, wait. You want him, I want her. He likes you.
Guess what? I finally got that seed out of my teeth.
Geez, sounds like you should be going on this date!
Pheebs, run!
Probably kill myself!
Well, I said that I...
Yeah, you do!
Saw the Porsche out there Mon, lookin' good. When do I get to take that baby out again?
Yeah, it is. It's really tough. Y'know sometimes I think-Wow!! Nice move!
No way! It's mine!!
Chandler, look they're actors. They're there to do a job, just 'cause they work together, doesn't mean they're gonna get together. I mean just 'cause it happened with Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins, it doesn't mean it's gonna happen with them.
Listen, I ah, I know it's a longshot. But, by any chance did she find that funny?
I saw you.
You're fake laughing too, right?
Hey Rach.
Yeah.
This is what I've got going for the party so far, liquor wise. Get a lot of liquor.
Hey-hey!
Chandler Bing.
No, thank you.
Anyone mind if I save this?
I do not.
Can I come?! I won't even talk! You'll just hear the noise from my video camera.
Yeah, or-or to get a hooker.
She told us.
You're not gonna let me buy the Knicks?? I can't believe you're taking this away from me!
Seriously, who is this guy?
I'm Joey.
Aaaah...
Thank you! Well, I guess now I know who I'm taking to the awards.
Uh-huh!
Oh well, okay, good luck.
Y'know, I'm beginning to see what Jake was talking about.
Take it easy. If it means that much to you, I'll uh, I'll go find something else.
Ohh. Hey, remember when I ran into this thing and it kinda knocked me out a little?
Ah, look who's back! Why do you have bags? RACH, WHY DOES SHE HAVE BAGS?
So did you guys make it in time?
Hey!
Yeah.
Pssst...
Yeah I knew what you were talkin' about.
If you want I could loan you some money?
Uhhh, I was an impulse buyer, near the register.
What do you got there?
No way! Look, Halloween is so stupid! Dressing up, pretending to be someone you're not...
So what? I drove down, sold T-shirts, had a blast. And y'know who knows how to party? Drunk college chicks.
Monica, look... I don't think you and I have any secrets anymore... Not ready to joke about it yet, okay, I see you later.
You don't keep it over here on this table any more?
Nana?
What-what are you guys doing here? I thought I told you not to come.
How could you do this to me Chandler?! This part could've turned my whole career around!
Well, I don't know!!
Why?
What?
Hey! You wanna go?
Really? Do you not know Chandler?
I'm just so nervous! Y'know? The callback isn't until tomorrow at five. I feel like my head is going to explode!
Hey listen guys, we feel really terrible.
It's really starting to hurt.
You know, uh... Chandler got you a gift, too.
Why not?
Oh! Ohh! Oh!!
Yeah, okay.
What?
But don't you need experience for a job like that?
Somebody help me out here!
Hey Monica! People came to see a fight, let's give 'em what they came for!
Well, they go into the chipper.
Hey, are you cool with this. I mean, I don't want to leave you high and dry.
You and Milton have to join us on the boat. Karen'll pack a lunch, you'll bring the kids, we'll make a day of it.
Come on man, you know I'd do it for you! Because, you're my best friend.
Yeah, I got too excited!
Because, I know what I like and what I don't like! It's not the same thing!
Are you serious?!
Well, you lied again!
Yeah, well you didn't call and leave your grip size.
Right.
No, no... how come you are working here?
Uhhh, Phoebe and Joey.
Yeah?
Oh, that sounds like fun, but we've got a ring to find!!
God, it's gonna so weird like when I come home and you're not here. Y'know? No more Joey and Chan's. No more J and C's. "You wanna go over to Joey and Chandler's?" "Can't, its not there."
Wouldn't she?
Just being friendly.
All right, all right. "Damnit Braverman, it's right there on the chart!"
Girls Chandler could never get?
Okay, uhh, would you rather be too wet or too dry?
I'll take it!
Then you're not invited.
Alright, come on you guys, it's not that big a deal. Really... I mean, I just go down there every other day and... make my contribution to the project. Hey, hey, but at the end of two weeks, I get seven hundred dollars.
Yeah, yeah, I guess.
No! I'm putting that in my room.
Really, a shower huh? And uh, which-which room might that be?
I want you to like her! But if that's too damned difficult for you, then the least you can do is pretend.
Oh, and plus I'm 1/16th Portuguese.
Ah-ah-ah! We're doing this! Okay, now you got me my first set of head shots. Right, how much were those?
Mom, so what did you think?
"I am what you made me. You know what? I could go right now."
How could someone get a hold of your credit card number?
Ross-Ross-Ross-Ross! Stay away from that guy , and that guy . And that one-Dude! They're all huge!
Fungus! Yeah. Place is full of it.
Hello? What are you talking about? The audition's not 'til 5:00! Well, nobody told me! Who'd you talk to? Nevermind!
Here's a little tip, she really likes it when you rub her neck in the same spot over and over and over again until it starts to get a little red.
Get him a bone, get a bone. You gotta bone?
Yes! Excellent! Perfect score!
Yeah, for sure. Okay. Probably want the first thing to be, never open your eyes. Y'know, because you don't want to be doing something and then look up and see something you don't want to be seeing.
WELL, I DIDN'T MEAN IT!
Hey! What's going on?
Yeah, yeah. The pay is pretty good and you could do it for as long as you need.
But this is a two line part, it's like takin' a step backwards. I'm not gonna do this.
Yeah, I know what you mean. I mean, sometimes...
Why?
Damn it!
Check this out? Huh? Yeah. That's the stuff. What do you think?
Oh, I do. How you doin?
So, you and Angela, huh?
Yeah.
Oh my God!
Really?
So, between her and me being friends, and her history with Ross, it just isn't going to happen. It would be like you falling in love with a cat.
Well Ahh, yeah! Yeah, sure, a drink sounds great.
I just had a glass.
..Naughty!
No! No! I can't! You gotta get me out of it! I've got plans! Important plans!
Ross has some big thing to tell everyone.
Would she? You ate my candy bar!
Y'know what? This is not fair to her. Let's just forget the tape!
Hey!
Well hey-hey if she needs any idea for costumes, she could be a bikini model, or a slutty nurse, or a sexy cheerleader huh-Ooh-ooh, Leatherface from The Texas Chainsaw Massacre-No-no-no! Slutty Leatherface.
Man, I remember the first time I saw that girl Katherine, after we broke up. She was just walking with her friend Donna, just laughing and talking. God, it killed me.
And?
Well, you seem pretty insulted by that. What? I'm not good enough for you?
Those two only had each other!
Hey, how do you spell suspicious?
Wait a second, wait a second, where have I seen that cowgirl outfit before...
What're you gettin' so bent out of shape for, huh? It's not like we agreed to live together forever. We're not Bert and Ernie.
Hey.
You know, ah, I've been thinking about this and I gotta tell ya, it's not my fault. It's a natural instinct.
Who was that?
I want to go on a ride along!
Oh umm, my big scene is coming up. Big scene coming up.
Yeah, I'm... I'm kind of having a little problem.
You're not gonna like it.
Sorry! Sorry.
Uh Rach, if you're gonna start another story, at least let me finish mine.
Okay, the last thing...
Welcome to America.
Ahh!
Yeah, I-I think that women just have a lower threshold of pain than men, that's all. I mean, come on, it's just a little wax.
Merry Christmas!!
Come on Ross, be a good guy. Step up and do it!
What?!
Oh God, yeah.
Oh my god Ross! You don't have Emma! And Rachel you don't have Emma! Where's Emma? Who has Emma!?
Which helps him get to Phase Three, picturing yourself with other women.
No thanks.
Look-look-look you guys, I need some help! Okay? Someone is going to have to convince my hand twin to cooperate!
Dude, I'm telling ya! I'm fine!
You partied with Hootie and the Blowfish?
Wow Pheebs, you speak Italian?
No way are you cool enough to pull of Clint.
Tampa Bay's got a terrible team.
I was going for quiet desperation. But if you have to ask...
And I think he would tell you it was a mistake.
Come on look guys, don't fight.
No! Not unless! Look this must end now!
She was all crying. She-she said you guys want different things, and that and that she needed time to think.
I was kinda hoping you'd stay.
Too long! Oh my God, Rach, I've been dying to talk to someone about this for so long! Listen, listen, we can't say anything about this to anybody, they're so weird about that! Listen...
Sure! Why not?!
That's ridiculous! I'm not a "Star," just a regular famous actor.
Oh, that's cool. We have interns at 'Days Of Our Lives'.
Hey! How you doin'?
What's up?
Ye-ye, we go to yours!
You know, I think I was sixteen.
Yes! Didn't you ever read Sports Illustrated?! No! I didn't read yours! But come on, we can go to the game tonight!
Well then help me get it off! Plus, it smells really bad in here.
Right!
Wanna play strip poker for practice?
Ohh, I love birds.
Get outta here. This is our stop too.
I don't know, it looks the same.
Oh No-no-no-no-no-no-no! He went over to Ross' to bring the dog back here!
Multi-colored robes! Ooh, and maybe a hat.
"Warden, in five minutes my pain will be over. But you'll have to live with the knowledge that you sent an honest man to die."
No-no-no-no, he's not! No! Why are you trying to ruin the game? Come on!
Almost cried huh? Hear that Chandler? Almost cried!
Man, we gotta do something about that guy. This morning, I caught him looking into our apartment. It creeps me out! I feel like I can't do stuff!
It's not a cat!
Well, that went well. Yeah.
Hey, I washed those!
Ok, um, uh, we three feel like, that uh, sometimes you guys don't get that uh, we don't have as much money as you.
I took a shot.
Hey.
Excellent.
Ross! Get a shot of this. Hey babies! These are the headlines on the day you were born! Okay, now girl baby turn away and boy babies... Check it out, huh?! This is what naked women looked like the month you were born. All right, now let's dive right into the good stuff.
Hi!
Is that your card?
Well why don't you just reach out and take his trampoline.
Hey, are you unsupporting me again?
Get your non-believer ass outta my chair!
So did that do anything for ya?
Mine's is to Lilian Myers.
That was good beer.
Yeah.
He's doin' some thinkin'!
I don't know. But I can see through your sheet. Yeah, yeah, that's her. But y'know what? Doesn't matter, I'm never gonna get to meet her anyway.
Maybe we should just eat now.
All right! Man, this is unbelievable!
Hey, Chandler, that table place closes at 7, come on.
They're so small!
That's right! 'Cause I'm a Tribbiani! And this is what we do! I mean we may not be great thinkers or world leaders, we don't read a lot or run very fast, but damnit! We can eat!
Hey.
Oh right great! Welcome aboard!
I can see why, nice shirt!
Hey, Ross! What are you doin'?
It's Rachel.
Hey-hey-hey you made it!
Okay, you hide my clothes. I'm gonna do the exact opposite to you.
I say, 'I am there!' Cool! Aw, is Ross going to?
Yeah, there's just one thing that might be kind've a problem. See, I, uh, had to kiss this guy.
Exactly.
This is how much we pay for electric?!!!
Some guy!!
Things that go "tssst" when you put them out.
Why? Is it because I'm friends with Phoebe?
Yeah! You three have a nice Thanksgiving.
Hey dude, what's up?
Oh, ahh, go to the window. I'm wanna run down to the truck and show you something.
So, so is she still going to Paris?
Excuse me, Aaron? Hi! Umm, I have a little problem with the schedules. Originally, I wasn't supposed to work today, and I have this wedding that I really have to be at. It's my best friend's, and I'm officiating so I really can't work past four.
All right! I'll try! But if I can't, you can stay with Chandler and I until you get settled.
Look, my best friends are getting married in like an hour. Okay? And I'm the minister. Please! Please! Can you pull it together?
Orrr, you could follow him and see where he goes.
I can't take any...
I would say, "Woman, please!"
Come on Rach! No one saw me take it! There was a whole table full of 'em.
If you get a second, find out where she got that cheeseburger.
Urse...
What are you talking about? It was a big deal. I mean, come on you can't tell me last night didn't mean something to you. I-I was there, you're not that good an actress.
Phoebe's a porn star!
You spent a hundred dollars. That's the limit. You're screwed!
In a minute!!
Then I blame you! Yeah! That's right! You threw me off with all your slapping!
But what about back home, anything going on there? Anybody you like?
I thought you already have a job.
Do we need a cake?
Why would I want another apartment, huh? I've already got an apartment that I love.
So you need someone who knows fashion, to tell you what looks good.
Why not?
Yeah you got 5 years left!
Okay that's fair.
No! No, I quit a long time ago. Did I forget to you that one? I'm sorry.
Think it'll work?
Ooh... I can't believe I'm kissing you. I'm kissing Rachel!
Hey! How is New England not a state? Huh? They have a sports-team!
Yeah, and there won't be a relationship left to rebuild.
OW, why, why, why?
They were in his office.
Pretty much, yeah.
What?
Uh me? Gay? No! No. No, but I have a number of close friends who are.
I know. I know. And she's not only my friend; she's my pregnant friend! She's my pregnant friend who's Ross' ex!
What, are you crazy? When a blind man gets his sight back, does he walk around like this?
Celebrity.
But you're spittin' all over me man!
What?
Oh, I'd love too, but I got acting class. But y'know what? I guess I can blow that off, for you.
All right, give it back to me. 5 of hearts.
But between you and Phoebe, I'd have to give the edge to Phoebe.
No, it's not, we have nothing in common!
Okay.
I know! It's stuck!!!
Oh what then? Kick me?
Chandler, she doesn't understand a word of English.
Sorry!
Oh-whoa-hey, dude, what are you doing?!
Oh come on! Just pick one! Between Monica, Phoebe, Chandler, and Ross if you had to, if you had to, who would you punch?
Because you two were having sex!
Ahh, forget about it, I'm havin' a ball. How's the apartment doin'
I got it from Monica. She sold it to me for a very reasonable price.
You know there already is a Joseph Stalin?
Art.
No, was my best friend. Anyway, I don't know why you're pushing for him so hard. With him out of the way as my best friend, there's a spot open.
See you in 2003.
Definitely!
Because Vincent, we were lovers. For two years!
Uh, don't you mean "for whom?"
Ooh! So close.
So, does that mean the audition is off?
Noooo, that's what I was wearing when I donated. I'm kinda surprised there's any of my boys left.
So, there was no miracle?!
Yeah, I figure they'll love it at the new house, you know? It has that big backyard. And then, when they get old, they can go to that special farm that Chandler took the other chick and duck to.
How are you doing?
Don't worry about that man, that happens.
Good luck. And I'm still right!
Where?
Really?
Had the beef-tips, huh?
Ten. Okay. Now Tag there's such a thing as to many women.
Yeah.
Well, what did you say to her?
Where are you gettin' this?
No! Because he didn't believe in my movie! Which is a big mistake because it is real! Real!
Oh, it was a lot of fun right up until Chandler got a finger in the eye!
Like you wouldn't believe. Wow! This is a great place.
And I ate the food, I had the fish, it was good, yeah. It was good, yeah...
Uh, I don't know. Ya see, it's just, see I was a regular on a soap opera y'know? And to go from that to this, I just... Plus, I'd have to wait on all my friends.
See, there was kind of a mix up in my agent's office, but I'm still on TV and that's good exposure.
"When can you move in?"
But, hey, look, you know the good thing is, is that we spent the whole day together and I survived, and what's even more amazing, so did she. It was bat day at Shea Stadium.
Who?
Okay, look, I think we have to tell Rachel she messed up her dessert.
I need to say goodbye to the table first.
Oh that's amazing.
Yeah!!
Ross?
Yeah, so we just keep trying and trying until we... do it.
Hello? Yeah, this is Joey Tribbiani... Oh, hi! Well, I'm glad you liked my letter... No my mommy and daddy aren't home right now... Okay, bye bye. She was nice!
Or an uncle...
Yeah-yeah right. That's okay. That's fine. That's uh, pretty much what I was expecting. So uh, it's no big deal. All right? I think I'm gonna go.
do you have any cake? >>> Joey's Subconscious So this is going pretty good. dinner was nice, got a lot in common. Victoria's secret huh we even like the same books. Oh now there's a scary painting. wait a minute I think I've been scared by that painting before. You know what this whole place look familiar I have definitely been in this apartment I know I've seen this weird plant before AWCH! It did that the last time. Oh my god, I've gone out with this girl before yeah we had sex on this couch and then on that chair and no. no we didn't do it hear which is weird because it seems like a perfectly good place.
What was it?
Oh, that's what she meant! You know, if they're gonna shorten it, they should call it the MUSE! You know, short for museum, and avoid all the confusion!
Hey, you're back!
Is that true? If I keep reading is Beth gonna die?
Come on man, you drove all the way up here.
Oh, "you do, do you"?
That's right baby.
Oh! Well that's it! He's the last one to go. I'm locking you guys in.
Yeah, she's been out there for twenty minutes, I'm surprised you didn't hear her on the way over.
Yeah, but, hey look, don't go through her stuff. She gets really mad.
Also so gay!
Of course he's gonna have his Uncle Joey!
Transplant.
Strike three! You only get one more, Mike!
Oh, hey let me.
Well, I've never been through the tunnel myself, 'cause as I understand it, you're not allowed to go through with more than one girl in the car, right. But, it seems to me it's pretty much like anything else, you know, face your fear. It have a fear of heights, you go to the top of the building! If you're afraid of bugs.....get a bug. Right. In this case, you have a fear of commitment, so I say you go in there and be the most committed guy there ever was.
Hey!
Is there anything we should know about the apartment?
Yeah, you've been avoiding her ever since we started going out. Look, I made an effort to like Janice, now I think it's your turn to make an effort to like Kathy by going out to dinner with us. Right?
Oh, I chose not to hear that.
Soldier down!
Good night!
No it is awesome!
Yeah, and when you do, he'll be lucky to have you.
It's the big night! We wanted to wish you good luck!
see ordinarily I would talk to her, but my confidence is shaken did I sleep with her? Did I not sleep with her?
Yeah, okay but look, buy uh-Hey-hey, y'know, y'know who else I like? You! And it-it doesn't get said enough. I like you Ross.
Or! You can just, y'know...
That's not funny at all!
All right. I can't see.
Okay, this is it. It's my big fight scene coming up.
Oh! I forgot you used to live here!
But I counted, you're not supposed to live here! Oh man!
Ahh, alright, alright, alright, I was young and I just wanted a job, OK. But at the last minute I couldn't go through with it so they let me be the guy who comes in to fix the copier but can't 'cause there's people havin' sex on it.
Sure.
Okay.
Hey!
No! No... and, for the record, I've also never given her a frosting from a can!
Come on Rach, not again. I got it! Okay? Let's start sailing, and I want to go over there where that boatload of girls is! Yo-ho-ho!
Whoa! Okay. Yeah well, who-who was in World War I?
Hey! Did Chandler show up yet?
Ok, ok! Fine! You can come, but don't tell anybody else. It's up on the roof at 8.
Days Of Our Lives. Anyway, you're not gonna believe it! My character is coming out of his coma!!
Oh, it is.
Well who is this guy?! Huh? Who is he? 'Cause I will track him down and kick his ass!
No, no!
Good, otherwise my watch would fall off.
All right, but in the future...
Monica-Monica-Monica-Monica, listen-listen, listen, listen, would-would it make you feel better if we all stop talking about Ross and Rachel.
Uhh, cause, uhh, I'm a neurosurgeon and that was clearly a case of, uh, uh, foodal chokage. Alright, look, I got to tell you something.
You got a little bored?
Shh, OK, here I come, here I come. See I'm comin' to fix the copier, I can't get to the copier, I'm thinkin' what do I do, what do I do...so I just watch 'em have sex. And then I say, wait, here's my line, you know that's bad for the paper tray.
Dude, tell me she actually told you this.
Hey, that woman's got an ass like Carol's! What? Thought we were trying to find stuff.
Oh yeah? Well, you don't know about Hugsy, my bedtime penguin pal.
Well, I guess we'll never know whose it is!
The Empty Vase. Translucent beauty...
That's good, just keep rubbing your head. That'll turn back time.
The hell with hockey, let's all do that!
Pheebs, who's Evelyn Dermer?
I'll be fun.
Twice?
I give you $ 500 for them!
Whaddya think? Today's the big day!
All right they got water, orange juice, and what looks like cider.
But it really...
Say hello to Reverend Joey Tribbiani!
Hello?
So, are you ready to go?
Yeah, you don't want that.
Woo-hoo!!
Dude!
Yeah I'll take that.
didn't till just now.
Son of a bitch!
You were supposed to duck!!! Why didn't you duck?
Well, this has been great!
I don't know.
I was tryin' to make a sale!! Oh, man, if I ever run into that guy again, do you know what I'm gonna do?
Really?
Have you seen Monica?
Hey Chandler, while you were sleeping that guy from your old job called again.
Oh, you want something serious. Y'know what you should do, you should get her one of those um, barium enemas. Those are dead serious.
Well, I... I know exactly what I'm gonna do!
I agree. I'm, like, in disbelief.
So? What-what-what happened?
Me neither, y'know what-
Whoa-whoa, what's the matter?! Talk to the captain!
Oh, that's, uh, that's Phoebe's friend's dog. I don't know what his real name is, but I call him Mozzarella.
Night.
Marcel, I'm hungry.
This is great, this is great, what else, what else?
Yeah. Yeah, that...that's exactly it. You're right. Yeah.
But equally real!
OK, alright, the people who threw the water.
I'm a doctor Cliff, not a mathematician.
Hey, hey, hey no.
Here you go. Let me ask you a question.
Hey, hey.
All right, well, we felt really bad about that so we decided we should all take a little trip together!
It may not be a bed of roses.
We're 29, we're not women.
Sure. Here. I'll uh, save your parking spot.
I'm, I'm okay. See.
The guy still won't put out, huh?
Hey, what have you guys been up too?
All right! Man, this is unbelievable! I mean, it's great, but...
What?!! That's even worse!!
She keeps punching me.
Because it kinda looked like I did.
Because I think this character is going to be suspicious about stuff.
I don't know. You dumped her on New Year's.
Shoot! Shoot! Shoot! Shoot, or just fall down. That's good too.
Oh you'll take 'em!
You just give him a spoon baby!
Yeah, you hang in there Teddy!
Chandler, you have to start getting over her. All right, if you play, you get some fresh air, maybe it'll take your mind off Janice, and if you don't play, everyone will be mad at you 'cause the teams won't be even. Come on.
Thank you Phoebe, that is very, very generous.
Uh, hang out?! How long?
Y'know what? I don't need this! Okay? I don't know why you're dumping all over my big break.
Thank you so much.
Look Chandler, it was instinct! Okay? I just went for it!
Dude, if you think Fireball's relaxing, you've obviously have never played.
A monologue? I don't have.. I got it. Aah! so... I'm gonna take off!
Yeah, the ah, trees that don't fulfil their Christmas destiny are thrown in the chipper.
Yeah. You know why? 'Cause you came to me first.
Hi!
Yeah bye-bye! Hey! So just a light layer?
What?
Then you do. Heh, heh.
Dude, stop talking crazy and make us some tea!
Say hello to the new champ of Chandler's dumb states game.
Hey Rach listen, did you know that during pregnancy your fingers swell up to twice their size and never go back.
No, I don't. It's like, ya know, you work your whole life for somethin' and you think that when you get it it's never gonna be as good as you thought it would be. But this so was. Ya know, it changed everything. Like the other day, I got this credit card application, and I was pre- approved. Huh? I've never been pre-approved for anything in my life.
Hey, is uh the rest of my candy bar around here?
Oh, he was this cab driver we had in London.
Hey!
Hey I-
Oh.
Hey.
Oh hey, don't worry. I'm still ordained from your wedding.
That's 'cause sometimes I just do it through my wall to freak you out.
Well, maybe a little. I wish you hadn't seen me throw up.
You should both know, that he's a dead man. Oh, Chandler?
Maybe I could give thanks for you shuttin' up, eh?
You ah, you forgot your shoes.
You could say that.
Hey, is that when you wrote salt water taffy man?
Takes it out of you?
What's wrong?
I think face to face.
Okay. "Hey, Timmy, I've got a surprise for you."
All right, that's it! He cannot do this to Phoebe. This guy is going to get the butt kicking of a lifetime! But, is he a big guy?
IN LONDON!!!
Yeah! Okay.
Get back in there!
Yeah, what's that about?
Hey. Hey look I am still Joey, okay. Flowers they're just, you know, they're nice to look at. And that happens to be a picture by a famous artist. Of a famous baby.
Hello.
Ohhh.
Why don't we just go on two.
Okay well, I was down on one knee with the ring in my hand.
Okay. Uhh, tortilla chips, yogurt.
I call it!!
I don't know whether it's just 'cause we're breakin' up or... what, but you have never looked so beautiful.
You want his yearbook?
Hey, Pheebs! It's Joey!
And what is his name?
I thought you paid. Ha, guess we won't be going back there!
Oh okay, okay! One more push! One more push! Come on honey, we're almost there! We're almost there!
Dude, I'm just trying to speak your language.
No-no-no, I think I'm gonna see how things go with Kathy. She's pretty cool.
Nice.
Look, come on you guys, you said you were gonna try! All right look, I came over here to invite you guys to a movie with me and Janine.
Later!
Yeah, whatever you need. Hey, you wanna go home?
Hey, y'know what a really good rainy day game is?
Well, maybe we can just tip the table a little.
Oh sure, right back there.
Oh, women can. You can't.
Oh, I don't know.... Yeah, can't do it.
Okay, what have we always wanted to do together?
Yeah! Yeah. I'll be all right.
Oh yeah. If you ah, move your hamper, you see what color the tile used to be. Yeah.
I don't wanna give up the bag. I don't have to give up the bag! Do I Rach? Oh, you think I should give up the bag!
What happens if you flick it?
Then you gotta come clean with Ma! This is not right!
Err, "I think you know".
About a month ago this guy spent the night with Rachel, I didn't see who it was but...
No. No way, I'm not signing that.
Is that why you bought all this stuff?! Well, y'know what I will not watch your TV, I will not listen to your stereo, and there's a cinnamon raisin loaf in the new bread maker that I'm not gonna eat! You know why?!
Oh my god, I got my very own stalker.
I know, she may be the hottest girl I've ever hated.
Wow, Pheebs! That sounds great!
Oh, they're so cute! Now, what, what kinds are they?
Well Ross, it seems pretty clear. I mean what's more important? What people think or how you feel, huh? Ross, you gotta follow your heart.
Well, I'm doing this telethon thing on TV and my agent got me a job as co-host!
That's a uh, that's a tough combination.
Look I'm sorry you guys, I-I just don't think so.
Uh, ah, Monica's pregnant?!
Hey, what's up?
No!
Right! And when is that due?
Cookie, now you can punch him!
I know! Neither did I!
46. Wow! Who's well educated now, Mr. I-forgot-ten-states?
Monica what're you doin'? You can't go shopping with her? What about Rachel?
I just have one question!
No, can we get back to me?
Hey!
But you're still moving in together, right? Because my ad came out today.
If you go to a hotel you'll be...doing stuff. I want you right here where I can keep an eye on you.
Yeah! I don't want you on the trip!
That I can do.
Thanks man.
Yep.
There's my scene, there's my scene. "Mrs. Wallace, I'm Dr. Drake Ramoray, your sister's neurosurgeon.
That's right! By his uncle too!
And that'll get rid of my wisdom?
I guess I didn't really think about it.
You know what it is? It's a nice place but I gotta see I don't know if I see myself living here. Oh, oh, oh, let me see... Yeah, I could see it.
You're fine, ok? But everyone else acts like an idiot around famous people!
Hey-hey listen...
I can fix it. Hold on. Look out. Look out.
Saw a girl with that vest.
Oooh.
Yeah?
Hey! What's up?
Uh, Pheebs, about your mom...
All right I'll talk in code. Remember when the kid sees those two blanks in the hallway?
We dare.
Oh, Monica and Chandler's recommendation. I want it to sound smart but.. I don't know any big words or anything, so...
Just pickle.
Is everything okay?
You may be a sissy but I'll still . All right, it hurts so bad, I could only let her do oneeyebrow and now... they don't match!
Okay, it all comes down to this. Whatever happens, happens. Destiny.
Look I don't know this baby. I don't know if she's a famous artist or not. You know, and I don't want to be a jerk but you're changing too much around here.
What if I smack my head on the concrete?
Why not?! I'm hungry.
Well, she and I said from the beginning that we weren't gonna do anything unless you were okay with it. And clearly..
Well, there is one way. His window's open, I say, we poke him.
Hey, how much will you give me to eat this whole jar of olives?
Yeah, where were you!
That's way uptown! That's like three trains away! Which is great! I love to ride that rail!
I know, yeah!
I have to pee. And Rachel's in the bathroom!
Where are you going?
I did not know that! Thank you Monica. I can't believe I almost lost another girl because of counting.
ALL FOOD!
Oh! Sure! How much? Two thousand dollars?
Eh! There you go.
I figured, take a guess, help a charity, free boat!
Hey Mon!
Yeah, and I met this really hot single mom at the store. What's an elf to do?
No, I didn't!
And you'll be nice?
All right! Here we go! 1999! The year of Joey!
Hey!
Yeah? Really? No one's home?
Actually, I really need.
Oh what, did someone outbid you for the teapot? Oh! Secret teapot?
And you don't a little good about donating the money?
Chandler, wait, wait, wait...
Yeah?
All right, it won't go down any further. It's stuck.
Wait a minute, you can't go to Tulsa. Maybe you forgot, but we've got tickets to the Jets game next week.
Look! Oh! Is that the Pope?!
Hey Rach, so can I sing happy birthday to you now?
Oh-ho-ho, yeah! Hey! Y'know what goes good with that?
Thank you. Wait-wait-wait-wait, you see me again. Hang on, the guy's butt's blockin' me. There I am, there I am, there I am, there I am, there I am...
You're kidding!
Oh my God! You did too? It totally freaked me out, what was that?!
Okay, first-first of all, you want to make it look spontaneous. I look down , look down, keep looking down; then I look up. See? All right, now you try. Look down , you're looking down, keep looking down...
No.
Oh, okay.
So he can't come?
But it is a big deal!! I have to tell someone!
I can do that! "Hello, I'm your professor. When I'm not busy thinking of important things or... professing. I like to use..." Oh, what's the product?
Obviously! So, how do we decide?
No, no, Emma has one Hugsy, the new Hugsy, huh? The other Hugsy, I don't know, I guess I'll just take it back.
Come on man, you're not a potato.
Right. Ok, ok, uh, ducks is heads, because ducks have heads.
Yeah, you could go to the game with me, ah, even though I know you said you couldn't. But then you lied to me and tricked me and gave me a bump on the head.
Oh, and how is Allison?
Wow, it is easy. Now, I can have milk everyday.
Hey.
Yeah.
Got ya.
Okay, bye.
Hey.
Hey.
Oh there is! If you want something enough and your heart is pure, wondrous things can happen!
I didn't get it?
So, so how did it happen?
Monica and Rachel made out.
Oh, God!
Finally you guys made it. Pheebs, who the hell-uhuhh!
Her name is Dutch, and also Marklan.
Thanks. That means a lot to me.
Okay. Table, you have given us so many great times. And you guys, Jordan, Victor, Joel... All of you guys. What can I say? You guys make us look good. You wanna say anything?
Ok.
Wow, that was kinda brutal.
How bad do you want to stick your tongue on that?
Okay.
Feminist issue. That's where I went!
Hey!
Whoa, ah!! We're you just gonna give me some lemonade?
Oh, we're having a big party tomorrow night. Later!
Over there! Before, with the bills! You tried to give some charity, I said "No," you dropped it. Okay? Then we had a nice last night together, we had some fun, we gambled, nobody tried to give anybody any money! Now out of the blue, you start with the charity thing again!
What?! He got me! Owwwwww!!!
Two thousand dollars!? What do you think I am? I soap opera star!?
Right... ok, so just from the top of the page, right here.
Yeah! Look!
So uh, what's your name?
Loud and clear!
Look, I don't know why the kids need a youth center anyway! Y'know? They should just watch TV after school like I did and I turned out fine!
Man, I didn't think we were gonna make it!
Yeah-yeah, it's down to me and two other guys.
All right let's just do this.
Stop staring at me!
Come on in, how are ya?
Thanks man.
Yeah! I totally forgot I'm supposed to be there. I can't believe I forgot. I usually write stuff like this on my arm. Oh! Stupid long sleeves.
I do it every year.
That's right I stepped up! She's my friend and she needed help! And if I had too, I'd pee on anyone of you!
No, no, no!
Wow! You guys seem to be having a good time.
Relax. You're only at nine centimeters. And the baby's at zero station.
hot not hot Hot!
Hi Ben! So you wanna be an actor huh? I gotta tell ya, it's no picnic. There's tons of rejection. No stability. One day you're Dr. Drake Remoray, the next day you're eating ketchup right out of the bottle.
Ross?
Are you going to do it?
Hey!
All right, look I'm sorry you guys, but it's just that I gotta get these new head shots made. And they're really expensive, y'know? I'm down to like three! Well, actually two 'cause one of 'em I kinda blackened in some teeth-Why did I do that?!
The trail from the woman you did it with to the woman you hope never finds out who did it! You always have to think about the trail!
Uh, de-clawing cats. Hey, tell ya what. Let me walk you home. We'll stop by every news stand and burn every copy of their Times and the Post.
Okay, it's a typical New York City apartment. Two girls are just hanging out.
So, you're just Bing?
Hey, how you doin'?
Uhm... oh! Okay. You come with me, and you tell them that the house is haunted!
Hey, here you go.
Yes, but y'know what? It doesn't matter who knows what. Now, enough of us know that we can just tell them that we know! Then all the lying and the secrets would finally be over!
"I can't. Oh, I want to, long pause, but I can't."
Oooh, what you got there?
Well how about this one? Testing the effects of Joey Tribbiani on attractive nurse receptionists.
Pheebs, I still need some help here.
O K.
Let me know about that coconut phone, it might great for the boat.
Yeah, but it's not gonna last. She's too much for me in bed. Sexually.
Well, no, not exactly! All right, look, I, I wasn't trying to save Ross. Okay? My sandwich was next to Ross. All right? I was, I was trying to save my sandwich.
Bye bye Mike!/Cya mike!/Bye mike!/Bye bye now!
What'd I tell you? What'd I tell you?
Oh yeah, it must be tough to keep your hands of him, huh?
It's not what you think, that was...
Sure, what do you want to see?
Thursday? But that's Halloween.
It was amazing! And not just for her... uh-uh. For me, too. It's like, all of a sudden, I'm blind. But all my other senses are heightened, y'know? It's like... I was able to appreciate it on another level.
Ha!
Whoa-whoa, Treeger made you cry?
It's still a tiny bit on fire there.
Wow! Maybe uh, maybe you and I ought to get to know each other a little better.
No, it's just ah, I care so damn much about little Ben that uh, it was more important to see him succeed.
I got that! I forgive ya! Don't come out here!
Oh, well. Just ask her how long she's gonna live. Women live longer than men.
What a bad idea!
I can't decide which route to take to Vegas. Hey, you've traveled a lot right?
How come you don't live with Mommy? How come Mommy lives with that other lady? What's a lesbian?
Well he actually saw you a little bit too.
look I don't usually ask out women that I meet in coffeehouses.
Six years? Wow... It's almost as long as highschool...
Hey!
Then why do you throw like one?
What?! All right-Hey! Don't look at me! You're the one who wanted to come up and look for some stupid Burger King comet!
Yeah.
You're right, you're right, I'll get back to work.
Okay, it's an audio question, name this television theme song.
Yes. It's just that she's so much smarter than all the girls I've ever dated! Combined! I don't want her to think I'm stupid!
Hey, Gunther. Can you uh, can you cover for me? I just got an audition.
Umm?
Come on! Admit it! That was the best nap you ever had!
I don't think so.
He's got the body for it.
Hey, maybe that's for the best.
No-no-no! No-no wait Rach, you know what would even be more fun? Telling them.
Ahh, you drive safe.
So are you gonna start taking this thing seriously?
Oh great! Great! Thank you.
Yeah. It's a shame people can't visit there.
Yeah! No?
Hey!!! Oww!! And I'm bleeding.
Well, at the Christmas party him and Santa did some definitely gay stuff!
That's right, mister, and I don't care how old you are, as long as you're under my roof you're gonna live by my rules. And that means no sleeping with your girlfriend.
Well, she graduated from high school!
I figure my character has kids.
Well, I'm totally over it Chandler. Friends forever! Don't come out here!

Oooooh!
Six months? Whoa that's rough.
I know I'm having the worst time. There was a 15-minute line for the buffet, and when I finally got up to the plates, I slipped on a giant booger!
Look it's not that bad. So what, it blocks a little of your door, a little of my door.
The Mr. Bowmont's here!!!
I mean seriously, she's like the perfect woman. I mean I know she turned me down, but if she hadn't and wanted to be with me, I would take her in my arms and... I haven't bummed you guys out like this in a while have I?
All right, I'm gonna go say hi the chick and the duck.
Uh, I scratched it on the ATM machine down on the corner.
Well, maybe I can help.
Um, sure! Did you, uh, did you try turning the knob back the other way?
Yeah. I realized it about a half-hour ago but I didn't want to say anything 'cause I didn't want to jinx it.
Mar-klan.
Well uh, I don't know about who's here, but I can tell you for damn sure who's not here and that's Rachel!!
Thank you! So, did-did he get it?
You were right. He is funny.
All right Ross you're in the lead, would you like to take another question or spin the Wheel of Mayhem?
Pickle? Pickles make her sick. Giving her pickles is like giving me salad.
Okay, for next time, what do you say?
No-no-no, no it's uh, it's okay.
Hey, I think Emma might like it!
Yeah! Yeah, I've been trying to find ya to tell to stop messing with her and maybe I would have if these damn boat shoes wouldn't keep flying off!
Yeah, they're not coming.
Oh come on man, you can dance with my partner, she's real, uh, mellow!
My folks.
Hey.
I got a big date coming up, do you know a good restaurant?
Thank you. Yeah, I appreciate that.
Really?
Oh, not at all. Happy to do it.
Oh, very funny. I don't know if you remember, but my audition was supposed to be Thursday. You got me the audition?! Let's hug it up!
Oh yeah. I rubbed a magazine on myself earlier.
So Pheebs, do they know about each other?
You said number two.
Hey, Chandler, when you see Frankie, tell him Joey Tribbiani says hello. He'll know what it means.
Yeah.
Ah, are you okay?
Sorry. Wrong boobies.
Yesterday's pages did not reflect my best work.
Ah, let me see! Damn, that's a lot of guys! Are you a little slutty?
Yeah! If you wanna sing at their wedding, well you sing at their wedding!
I love that movie.
Wait a second, I see what you're trying to do here! You-you're trying to give me money again!
And, a brownie! Well, half a brownie. Actually, it's just bag. It's been a long walk from the flower shop and I was startin' to feel faint so...
Can I use your phone? Yeah, the number for a Sidney Marks, please.
No I'm not. Why would you say that? That's just mean.
Maybe she never got your message.
No, still too ethnic. My agent thinks I should have a name that's more neutral.
Hey-hey dude, why are you changing the subject? Why? Will you make the call or what?
Yeah. And look, I just want you to know that with Rachel staying here and everything, all my feelings from before are totally over, okay? And even if they weren't, when you accidentally walk in on a woman using a breast pump...
Alright thanks, Oh hey have you talked to Chandler?
You son of a bitch!
Hey!
Hey-hey.
All right. But, you're gonna have to tell them.
Hey!
He doesn't do much, does he?
All right! You can have the chair.
Cute! This is Janice! You remember Janice?
What?!?!
Yeah. I'll see you in the morning.
Pretty good. It's like you said. It's mostly just putting numbers from one column into another column.
Oh uh, ordinarily I would love too, but I am just swamped right now.
Oh man! Now she's gonna start all over! We're never gonna get to introduce the hot girls to the new world!
Right.
I'm not finished.
This conversation never happened!
Hello?
Well, maybe he's, maybe he's this really cool pharmacist guy.
Hi, here's the deal. We lost a carseat on a bus today. It's white plastic, with a handle, and it fits onto a stroller. Oh, and there was a baby in it. He wants to talk to you again.
Yeah I did!
Yeah, just a crush! That's all this is! It's a crush! I'm Joey; I don't get deep feelings.
Just what needs to be done! Dearly beloved, we are gathered here to join this man and this woman...
Hey, how you doin'?
Well, I'm pretty tired from lugging the trees around all day. Hey, Phoebe listen, you got this all wrong. Those trees were born to be Christmas trees, their fulfilling their life purpose, by, by making people happy.
Phoebs look, if you want to know what the deal is, you're just gonna have to ask him.
Listen, drama critics they're nothing but, but people who couldn't make it as actors. You know what you should do?
Okay.
You are beautiful, you know that?
Are they? I didn't know I cared that much.
So what are you gonna do?
It's a pleasure to meet you Ray.
Yeah, you're roommate is a soap opera star.
Oh, yeah, yeah, listen for it.
Yeah.
A meatball Sub? Thanks!
I know, but, I was the best, you know? I liked being the best. I don't know. Maybe I should just get outta the game. They need guys up in housewares to serve cheese.
Fine! Let's just go. I don't need your stupid dinner.
No! No. Don't do that, just next time make sure she really likes me.
Well, how long do you think it'll be?
Oh, OK.
Okay!
Of course!!
Okay...
Okay, Ross, look-look-look-look, look right here. That's called a scrum, okay? It's kinda like a huddle.
Oh.
I can do an English accent?! That baby's going on my resume!
That's true. But you know what, it doesn't matter because I already know who you're gonna go home with tonight.
Does it really matter?
C'mon, she's your mom!
Uh, well he's 33.
You know it's funny you should mention that 'cause I was thinkin'... what's with the boxes?
Hey, I only got one good arm, you know. You should be doing stuff for me. Go get me a sweater.
I'm not talking to you! You broke my fridge!
Ross, did you really read all these baby books?
Oh.
You got all that from the back of her head?
"Take good care of your Momma son."
All right, don't waste it, I mean its still food.
Yeah, you too.
Can I ask you something?
So what're you going to do?
Just when I thought we could be friends.
I uh, I just came by because I-I want to talk to you about something.
Yeah, three days on the lake without a shower. Plus! I fell in that big tub of worms at the bait stand! Hey, how-how's he doing?
What are you talking about alone? What about Ross?
All right! But, you do it with me once.
Oh, well great.

OK.
I can't find the remote. Thank you.
Plus, y'know, I think it should be Joe. Y'know, Joey makes me sound like I'm, I dunno, this big. Which I'm not.
You shut up! I love arguing with her. I'll be right back.
Monica? What time is it?
Oh I am!
Yeaah.
Man, hell of a two weeks, huh? Y'know what, though? I really feel like I learned something.
Oh my God!
How does it feel knowing you're never gonna be with another woman again huh? Knowing you're gonna have to wake up to the same face everyday until you finally have the sweet release of death.
What-But you saw the show!
Hi!
Is to have a long, long talk. Y'know? Get Joey out on the open road and really open him up.
Absolutely! He's not thinking about you.
Yes.
All right, and over there is Brady's Pub where I like to unwind after a long day of surgeoning.
Get out of here, really?!
This is my friend Rachel. Rachel, Kash, Kash, Rachel.
The blizzard. I just saw on the news, it's like the worst snow storm in 20 years! They already closed all the bridges and tunnels.
Yeah! And-and things aren't as...smashed down as I thought they were gonna be.
But, he loves Emily?
Me?
MIKE!!!
There's this woman, that I like. A lot. Well, it's complicated. She's with this other guy. For a long time. And I could never do that to the guy, y'know? 'Ccause we're really good friends.
Won't-won't that take longer?
Looks like that no date pact thing worked out.
'Kay!
Y'know what else makes you wonder?
Okay umm, I just came by to tell you that I...want to have dinner with you tonight. That's all.
Thank you all for coming. We're here today to pay respects to a wonderful agent and a beautiful woman... ..inside. As Estelle's only two clients we would like to say a few words. Dude, where's my speech? That is entertaining. Al Zebooker everybody.
All right. Don't look at my list, Ross, 'cause there's a lot on there that you don't have.
What is he doing? What, Emily, thinks Ross's furniture has got Rachel coodies?
No.
The balloon?
Come, come here.
Maybe, maybe we did a good thing, helping Ross get back on his feet!
Pheebs! You're blocking the porn! Look out!
Uh-huh.
Well, I'm sorry. I thought parents were coming! Y'know? Your parents are comin'! Chandler's parents are comin'! Ross's parents are comin'!
Y'know, about what happened with us.
Joey! Joey.
Yes, it's in my... In...in my pocket. My back pocket! My back pocket!
What... for how long?
Uh, Pheebs, you're leaking?
Hey!
Hey.
I can hear that!
Why would he turn off the TV?
What? What's going on?
So that's why I feed my dog Purina One! Pick up a bag today!
All right Carl, we're next. Now remember, what is not gonna be?
Don't interrupt me when I'm talkin' to God! Now where were we? Oh right, okay. Do you Dina, take this man...
Yeah! I made it of this fruit bowl I found in the garbage.
I mean, the giant is like five years younger than me, y'know, you think I'll ever get there?
Hi.
Hey Phoebe.
Oh-whoa, what party?
Hey!
Uh-huh.
Oh well I think I am, yeah and I think I'm definitely gonna get the part.
Sure.
Yes.
You do attract some stinkers.
Oh, tell me about it. And she's been on the show forever, it's gonna be really hard to fill her shoes.
Where's all the tissues?!
Good for you!!
No-no, stay right there. Gettin' closer.
They're gonna do it together.
Now? You want me to go over there now?
Wow.
You got a better idea?
You know what? This is a bad idea. Forget it. Forget it, and listen, do me a favor, this conversation was between you and me.
Hey, can you close that window Chandler? My nipples can cut glass over here!
No, I don't think so, see Ross, because I think you love her.
You guys got anything to eat? I just went down to Johnos for some chicken and it was closed!
Me! I'm up for puppets!
Toutes la smore! Bu blu-ay bloo blah ooh! Pfoof!
Well, stuffed clams.
What?
But you said one.
Yeah, I don't think that's what it is.
"You know!"
Hey man, you feeling any better?
Okay, so that's another five hundred. Five hundred and five hundred, that's...
Hey.
Not likely. 'Cause you see that body bag right there
Sir.
Enough said, I'm there for you man. Where is she, upstairs?
Aww, you guys are so cute!
Well, y'know those special skills I have listed on my resume? I would love it would be great if one of those was true.
No! No-no. Look, there's a bug stuck in tar right here.
How you got three women to marry you, I'll never know.
I'm not going anywhere, sweetheart.
Sure.
Well, it comes and goes. I wouldn't trust it.
Porsche.
Dude, dude! I think you're losing it.
You serious?
Yeah, well, I still got a week left to go in the program, and according to the rules, if I want to get the money I'm not allowed to conduct any... ersonal experiments, if you know what I mean.
Oh, hey Katie! Everyone, this is Katie.
Ahh, to be 13 again.
David Lynn! David Lynn! David Lynn!!
Yeah, toast, oatmeal... nothing that spatters.
Maybe she wants you to learn something. Huh? Now is there anything you're really bad at y'know, sexually?
Uh, really good. Really good. Yeah, I should be ready to kill myself any day now. Wow, you sure found that quick. I just-I wish I didn't feel this way about Rachel anymore, y'know? I wish things could go back to normal. I mean, I love living with her and God, helping out with the baby is just amazing, but now I think...I think Ross feels left out. Y'know? When I had to take Rachel to the hospital, the doctor thought I was the father. God... You should've seen the look on Ross's face. By the way, I have no idea what I'm doing here. For all I know I'm just locking it more. Oh hey, did you try opening it with a credit card?
No. No.
Wow, I've admired your work for years. You-you've done some really amazing stuff.
Why-why would she go in the bedroom?
Hey, it's me. Listen Casey and I were on our way back and had a little car trouble.
It's uh, right through there.
Hey, you can't say you're breezy, that, that totally negates the breezy.
London baby!!
It's okay, Ross, alright? I totally understand. Of course you're not fine. You're.. You're Ross and Rachel.
Hang up, hang up.
People, people, people.
Somebody was using his head. Hey, let's check out the rest of the place.
Yeah. All right, I'll talk to you later.
What?
The allergy guy got the part! Thanks!
Well, I'm starting to make good money on the show and I'm thinking... I should probably do something with it.
All right. It's a new day, and it's just a crush, that's all! Just a little crush! All that worrying I was doing, that was crazy. Crazy! Like my friend here the bird would say, "it was cuckoo!" Everything's going to be fine. It's just a crush.
Fine.
And you couldn't think of anything else?!
All right, I'm going. I'm going.
Fumble!
Hi!
Hey-hey! Stanley! Hey-hey! You're leading man is here! Let's get to work.
Ross, Ross, Ross... It's okay.
All right look, y'know how-y'know how when you're dating someone and you don't want to cheat on them, unless it's with someone really hot?
Hey! Don't you hang up on me! I'll marry you and me right now! I have the power!
Oh God! So what do we do?
Welcome to New York City! Or should I say "ghe deu flooff New York City"?
Oh, have either one of you guys ever been to the Rainbow Room? Is it real expensive?
Yeah really, Ross, have you ever been beaten up before?
Uh-huh.
Better?
Ooh, that bad, huh?
And that's how I know you didn't watch the tape! .
Yes you are!
You want my advice?
I was tryin' to make a sale!! Oh, man, if I ever run into that guy again, do you know what I'm gonna do?
You can totally tell! Here look, watch me. Smile! Frown. Smile! Frown. Smile!
You're kidding right?
Would you let it go Ross. It was just a dream. It doesn't mean...
Hey, what's up?
Sounds nice.
Okay, buddy-boy. Here it is. You hide my clothes, I'm wearing everything you own.
Oh, yeah, that. All right, means that much to ya, I'll let you have her.
And I got custody of the kid, right? Now suppose the kid dies and-and I gotta buy a new kid.
Gotcha.
Sometimes I think maybe she could. But it doesn't matter, because I can't do anything about it.
I know! I mean it's not like we weren't cool about it.
Let's go watch it at your place.
See? That's a great smile! Easy. Natural. Now, pretend I have a camera. You're changing it!
All that stuff you just said? I want that!
Yeah! I was thinking about maybe going upstairs and taking a little nap on my couch.
Who's that dirty old lady?
What do you like better action or comedy?
Yeah, I just got off the Internet! Man, there is a lot of porn out there!
Definitely not invisible.
Wow, you are a good friend, 'course the audition was this morning, and I didn't get it. But that was a hell of a kiss. Rachel is a very lucky girl.
Ugh, I cannot wait to ask her out!
Yeah, but, Ross, I mean, you're not okay with it.
Uhm... A penis model. Anyway, hey... Did you tell Chandler that some guy from work is the funniest guy you've ever met?
No way! Mr.Salty is a sailor, all right, he's got to be, like, thetoughest snack there is.
Yeah, you shoulda been there last night.
What are you in love with her or something?
Anybody want a croan.
Well if he's not gonna eat it, I will.
And a 50. Huh, these must be Chandler's pants.
How about 'cause if you don't, his mother might.
Yeah-yeah, yeah, with that-that uh, plumber girl...
Feminine.
Come on! Look just-just tell-let her know that you really want them to be there. Let's not forget, this is a woman that has sent you many lasagnas over the years.
They loved me!
No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no... It's okay, I mean I-look Rach, I know I scared you off with that whole Naked Thursday's thing, but we don't have to do that!
Done! I did it! Heh, who's stupid now?
So, you saw me on Days Of Our Lives huh? Want me to, want me to do a little Dr. Drake Remoray for ya?
Really?
No, I do six things! First, I look deep in her eyes. Then, I kiss her. Next I take my hand and I softly graze her thigh.
Why not?
I can't look at you right now!
What's the matter with Rog?
I'm gonna go down there and teach that guy a lesson.
Well, I know what I'm giving you for Christmas.
Do you want any help?
So Pheebs, where are you doing all, your bell ringing?
Nothing! It was something.
Yeah, I know.
Hey Pheebs, guess who we saw today.
Hey Ross! The baby's kicking!
Probably not. Nah. I don't know how much I'm gonna wanna play after you go.
Hey!
Dude, you should've gone out once and a while.
Yeah-yeah. And the craziest thing is that I just ate a whole pizza by myself!
How's that going?
Oh yeah, sure. Ehhh.
Yep. Hey, what do you say we make it a double feature?
Okay, I wanted to surprise you, but for your house-warming gift, I got you a baby-chick and a baby-duck!
Oh my God!
Not knowing when to shut up...
Ah, can I just say I know we're doing this for Ross, and that's cool, but if it was up to me, this is not what we'd be doing on our first date.
Well then let me do it!
I'm the lead in Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.!!
Nooo. No, no, ah, are you sure it wasn't something that sounded like Ginger, like ah, Gingeer?
My friend Rachel has a kid. I totally know nursery rhymes!
I gotta get one, too.
Road trip! Yeah, we can rent a car! I just have to be there by Tuesday!
Good luck, good luck!
My god, Angela.
Hey, if she were marrying a guy, she'd be like the worst lesbian ever.
Oh, you didn't see the Post?
I love ya.
What is the big deal?
Oh! Tell her she's not marriage material.
I'll show you how.
Hey Pheebs!
My identical hand twin! The person whose hands are exactly like mine! This thing is a gold mine!
Really? Who-who have you taught?
Umm, y'know how the other day you were talking about how you didn't get to go to London and how you were kinda feeling left out?
All right, all right.
And it's not fake, it's totally brutal.
And I gotta pay rent! Look, how-how about this? You don't fire me, instead I stay here, I gain their trust, and they'll start listening to all the nice things I've been saying about you.
Where's my underwear?!
Yes sir! Yes sir, I'm-I'm-
Oh hey, do you still have their final exams?
I don't know! Yeah, I do.
How late are we?
Shhhh!
Oh, yeah, yeah, good idea.
No-hey-no! If you don't want me to do it, I except that. I don't care about that. I just...I don't want you to be upset.
I'm really sorry you guys.
Yeah, all right.
All right, uh, we've got a little bit of a problem here. These people are my friends; you can't treat them that way.
Yes it is perfectly good, and it is not one of the places the duck got sick!
You know, I could like maybe... I could do a dramatic reading of one of her books!
Hey, everybody lies on their resume, okay. I wasn't one of the Zoom Kids either.
Well, I'm- I'm showering.
All righty, what do you say we head back to my place?
It is me! It's a musical version of Tale of Two Cities. So I think I'm gonna sing New York, New York, and ah, oh I left My Heart in San Francisco.
No.
Nice!
How do you think I got him in the first place?
That's not gonna happen. No. Because we have a new deal!
All right, you're right. I'll talk to her.
Pheebs, he seems to enjoy it.
Yeah, she broke up with me.
No idea! But the guy I said it to dies in the next scene so I guess it means "you're gonna get eaten by a bear".
Rach, it's, it's ah, it's not that we don't want to, really. Are we talking models in their underwear?
So, did you err... did you tell Ross?
He's back! The peeper's back!
Oh my God! Is that why you guys had to get married?!
Dude! I am trying to sleep!
Hey-hey come on you guys, give him a break. Ross, seriously, how's it going with her?
Why?
Yeah!
Oh, yeah, he rode the bus today.
Uh, they're like my best friends. Are you saying we can't hang out with them? 'Cause that would kinda be a problem.
Umm, well, what else could it be?
Oh. Okay. Ooh! Ooh! Okay, maybe I'll talk about London! Y'know when you two hooked up! Only, only I won't say hooked up. I'll say, "Began their beautiful journey..."
That's right.
Uhh, 11!
Sure is.
Oh!
Ah, hi, ah. Thank you so much for whispering for my benefit, but, ah, look, if you just tell me what I did wrong, I'd just love to work on it and come back and try it again for you. And, and also: 'How you doing?' You should, please, just gimme another chance. I really wanna get better, please.
Yeah, I think we said good-bye to that when we invented hammer darts.
Oh, I'm so sorry. I don't know any Spanish words.
Well, I sorta am. I mean yeah, I'm dating this girl who's also seeing another guy. But, I don't know, I'm not to worried about it.
No-no, not for like another two weeks.
Oh? Oh! Okay! Okay! Let's hear their plan! Now, what's the future look like for Dina and Bobby?
Ahhh!
Ah whatever!
Oh, hey, Chandler, we, ah, we stopped by the coffee shop and ran into Ross.
Well, that went well. Yeah.
Hey Gunther, have you uh, have you seen Chandler?
Can I tell you something? Me too.
Oh, I embarrass you?
Wow! Well, my folks really liked it! So what-what did you guys think? It wasn't that good.
Wow, that's, uh, dirty.
Don't stop! Move the bowl further away! Ross could make that shot!
And I'll have all the muffins.
Hmm. Do you sleep with women and never call them again?
Ooh, great! Thanks!
Oh man!
Oh my God. You do?
Oh, yeah. He's got that great baby smell. Get a whiff of his head.
But I-I-I can't stay too long, I gotta get up early for a commercial audition tomorrow and I gotta look good. I'm supposed to be playing a 19-year-old. What?
Hey.
Sorry Phoebe.
Not as upset as he's gonna be when he finds out what I did with his sweater vests!
I've got cold feet.
Bye-bye.
Y'know what I think? I think somebody's got a little crush on Casey. How 'bout I fix you two up? What do you think?
Nice going. You just saved yourself a couple months of sex.
This is so unfair! The one thing I wanted to do was throw my best friend a bachelor party, but no, I wasn't allowed to. All I got was a stupid steak dinner!
Ahh, the babies miss me?
Oh, man. What're the odds of that happening?
Yeah, the stripper stole it.
Hey and everbody is so nice. I just had a good talk with that lady with the red hair, Jeannie.
Hey!
Oh, uh, okay, how, how about now?
Well that thing is clearing in the way! All right. Ah-ha! Ah-ah!! Damn fridge!
So? Who would you rather have kiss you, me or Chandler?
No, no, no more! I cannot lose another dime! I'm serious this time! In-in fact, look, there's a-I wanna give you something. And let me give it too you know before I pawn it for Cups money. Now, I want you to have the big white dog as a kinda of a, y'know, thank you for being such a great roommate.
So I guess you all saw it.
Hey!
Yeah, I'm an actor.
Ok. He kept my dollar.
Oh you know uh Kash, really liked you the other day. He said he thought you were charming.
Yeah!
London baby!!
Ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah! Enh? All right, what do you think?
Really? Thanks.
Hey uh, can I, can I talk to you guys for a second?
Yes!
What?!
Joe Stalin. Y'know, that's pretty good.
Fine!
Okay, what else?
I just wanna say that I'm sorry I referred to the vein as a seperate person...
We don't need that wizard guy. We hit a couple of clubs, talked to some strangers, and uh, after this, we'll head down to the docks and see about that boat thing.
Yeah, but I don't wanna die!
Or maybe, it's because you're hanging around here at 11:30 on a Wednesday.
Oh, what's wrong?
Oh yeah.
No, no, look. All I'm saying is that you're my agent, ok? And you're not getting me into any auditions and I'm tired of it.
Ohh!
You got porn!
Good luck, and uh, take care, huh?
Well I didn't tell them!
I don't get it, Chandler loved it!
Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman.
'Cause he has a strong suspicion that you dropped the ball on the Lender project.
Sure! But hey, you know this way sounds good too.
I wanna be mr. Wigglemunch.
No. No. No.
Noooo. No-no-no, these babies sell themselves.
So you're ruling out surrogacy?
Fine, make fun. I think it's jaunty.
Hola, amigos!
It'll be great for next weekend.
Yeah, Monica made us!
Oh, I-I, I think that's the first time I ever missed a meal! Yeah, my pants are a little loose!
Like this. Pictures of cute babies we don't know. We..we can't have that.
YEAH!!! YES!!!
No, it's too wrinkly to be a mole.
A four and a nine.
Come on you guys, come on please-please just give her another chance, huh? She'll come around I promise.
She's probably exhausted from all that adorable screaming she did last night.
Hey!
No! No! No, not after seeing that.
Why not?
Ew! What is that? Something exploded!
I never know how long you're supposed to wait in this type of a situation before you can talk again, you know? Maybe a little longer.
It's just I can't because my manager said I... "Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you. Happy birthday dear Annie...
No-no-no-no-no! It's a surprise, but it's gonna be tricky thought because she said she was gonna be pretty busy at work for a while.
Pheebs! There you are!
C'mon show us what you bought. . . You know you want to.
Over the line?! You-you're-you're so far past the line, that you-you can't even see the line! The line is a dot to you!
Yeah! Okay! Hey! Hi!
One pregnant woman at a time, please! I just want you to be okay.
Good.
Okay now, before I make my final decision I uh, I just want to make sure our personalities match. Okay, so I made up a little test. Now, I'm gonna say a word and then you say the first thing that comes to mind.
Okay, uh...sit down. Um... there's this woman that I like. A lot. But, uh...it can't happen.
No more jam?!
Yeah, at Macy's. You were the Obsession girl, right? I was the Aramis guy. Aramis? Aramis?
Aww, man. That's the girl I was hiding from. When she finds out he's my roommate, she's gonna tell him what I did.
Hey, what happened to your fancy chef's jacket?
Two brothers, one died!
Ok. Why?
I can't tell you what I'm wishing for! Else...you know...won't come true!
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Slow down, you go way too fast. Ok? Just go back to the MET, ok?
Huh. Huh.
They go on one date and you're worried about them getting married?! He's not you!
Hey. I just got off the phone with Estelle and guess what. I GOT THE LEAD IN A MOVIE!!!!!!
What?!
Dude! He's right there!
What about me?! You-you just said I could!
Pizza, heh, its not like I never had that before...ba dum bum cheshhh.
Hey!
It's Monica, ok?
Yes!
Paper, snow, a ghost!
Whoa-whoa, but her birthday isn't like for another month.
Really?
Look, it's okay, no, no, no, really, look um, I really appreciate this Pheebs, but I think I'm gonna have to go back to Estelle.
All-all right! Start it up! Let's go!
I'm gonna go shave.
We're geniuses! Yeah, look at them, look at them, they're really bonding.
Okay. Okay, okay, hey. There we go, let's get your feet up there. Good night, Kate. Sweet dreams. I'm gonna put this can right here in case you have to hurl.
You can't go out there.
Like what?
Oh! Any word on casting yet?
I'll take it back tomorrow.
I don't get it. I mean, I was so sure this was what I wanted.
Hey Mon! Want some pancakes?
Well I had a great time! Learned how to bake, ate great food, that's the first A I've gotten since seventh grade, and I didn't have to sleep with the teacher this time.
Yes!
You?! And-and you?!
Look, I'll come to the party but I'm not dressing up.
How could you lose him?
Oh, wow! I'm so sorry, ok? I promise, we'll do better next time!
Uhm... Yeah... this uhm... raccoon came in...
Oh, yeah?! Then how come I keep thinking about her in all these sexual scenarios and stuff huh?!
Hey! Get into gear!
Good. Hey.
We already knew that!
Who did?
Everybody's doing stuff!
Okay.
Hey come on now, this is a real date. Uh, so...nice place you got here. Foosball, huh? Pizza box. Oh, a subscription to Playboy, my kind of woman.
So Ross?
Hey, how much did you guys tip the super this year?
Yeah, yeah. He's got a, he's got a really bad cough, and our vet, he can't do anything about it. Is there something you can do?
Excellent! Excellent! And uh, finally, are you into any weird stuff y'know, sexually?
HEY! I never have an off night ok although sometimes when I'm a little bloated I don't feel very sexy BUT EVEN THEN I'M BETTER THEN MOST!
Well if it's free food, how come you're charging me for it?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, whoa. Do you ah, want to get her something speacial, get her flowers, get her candy, get her gum, girls love gum.
Which part exactly?
Oh... oh, but that's ok, I'll find someone else to do it... I'll do it alone, but... I don't know what happens if the sea turtle catches you...
Chandler is a complex fellow, one who is unlikely to take a wife.
Oh.. I don't know why this is so hard for me. you know.. I mean lying is basically just acting and I am a terrfic actor.
All right, who got Chandler? 'Cause I uh, need to trade.
Wooooooooow It's like they're on fire!
All right, what are we havin'?
Oh my God! I overslept! I was supposed to be on the set a half an hour ago! I gotta get out of here!
Great, I'm finished! In fact, I just dropped it off at the agency.
Here we go! Here we go!
All right, I guess this will be fine.
It's never gonna happen.
Rachel's right. This is where you guys belong.
I will be okay! Look Chandler, you gotta get it out of your head that I can't take care of myself. Okay? Look, I'm not gonna miss you helping me out with money. The only thing that I'm gonna miss...is you. And now the dog.
Hey.
What-what is it, what is it?
That kinda sounds like your dream dude.
Hey, it's great having you back. You know, stay as long as you want, and when does she stop crying all night?
That's okay. Chandler's the one I'm mad at.
What do you mean?
Hey.
Whaaat?
Oh, man, she loved it! She's over there showing Monica and Rachel right now.
I know, I know..., but that's okay. I mean, we can control ourselves, we're not animals.
Well anyway, the guy they wanted backed out and now they want me! I start shooting today!
You're ready?
No! I want an award I did win! But nobody's giving me any of those! Plus-Hey Rach, if-if I put it up there right? When people come over they'll see it and they'll think I won it.
No-ohoh.
I'm afraid the situation is much worse than we expected. Your sister is suffering from a..subcranial hematoma. Perhaps we can discuss this over coffee.
Take it back?
I did?
Okay, but I don't see you asking any other paying customers to put on aprons.
Alright open your eyes.
WHAT?!!
We'll be there.
but, but..
Yeah, they're great seats too!
Yeah, well don't get me wrong, you're a better agent than she is, but at least with her I don't want to blow my pretty dumb brains out.
Okay, some tricks of the trade. Now, I've never been able to cry as an actor, so if I'm in a scene where I have to cry, I cut a hole in my pocket, take a pair of tweezers, and just start pulling. Or ah, or, let's say I wanna convey that I've just done something evil. That would be the basic 'I have a fishhook in my eyebrow and I like it' Okay, let's say I've just gotten bad news, well all I do there is try and divide 232 by 13. And that's how it's done. Great soap opera acting tonight everybody, class dismissed.
Yeah, hey hey, Happy Thanksgiving everybody!
Okay.
Oh, it was amazing. You know how you always think you're great in bed?
I got you something! Open it! Open it!
You do have a choice!! Ross, why are you listening to her?! Are you, are you crazy?!
Uh, sit down. I wanna talk about our situation.
Let's just say there's a well-dressed pack of dogs in Ohio. Hey Monica listen is-is Phoebe there? I gotta ask her something about the car.
Yes! I will have the lobster ravioli.
No! No! No! No! No! How you doin'?! How you doin'-Damnit Carl! Go wait in the hall!
Stupid Gap on every corner!
All right. Let's get the contestants out of their isolation booths. And they're off!
That's my line! I can take it from here, thanks. Dearly beloved, I'm sorry I'm a little late. You may be confused by this now, but you won't be Memorial Day weekend 2002. Well, let's get started before the groom takes off again. Huh? We are gathered here today, to join this man and this woman in the bonds of holy matrimony. I've known Monica and Chandler for a long time, and I can not imagine two people more perfect for each other. And now, as I've left my notes in my dressing room. We shall proceed to the vows. Monica?
Kathy was being really nice and you just walked away. I thought we had a deal.
You're driving me crazy with that!
No-no-no-no-no.
Check out the rack on this chick!
And starting to think about settling down!
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa-whoa! We could have our own show! Y'know we could clap our hands together people will love it! Huh? And-and-and I wrote a song for us! This hand is your hand! This hand is my hand! Oh wait, that's your hand! No wait, it's my hand!
Have you ever tried to sit through Citizen Kane?
Hey, Paul!
Oh no-no Rach, please, don't be sorry. Okay? Don't be sorry. Y'know I was only kidding you.
I guess.
It will be when you look like that in a tight skirt! This is great! I'm getting more dates than ever!
So, you were both dorks. Big deal.
No-no, no! We have to move the table into my room, yeah! 'Cause of all the boxes. Come on!
Oh really! Where? Somewhere funny I'd bet!
They're takin all my stuff back. I guess you were right.
What? Me having a job?
So you like the nachos uh? Myself I'm partial to...
Come on! It'll be fun! Me, you, and Ross, and... Paul probably...
So what.
She's comin'.
Why God?! Why are you doing this to us?!
Can I offer you a drink?
that would've been better, I'll try that Hi I'm Joey.
They do!
Oh, hey, Lauren. Uh, you guys this is, this is Kate's understudy, Lauren.
Don't worry, it's out there! I think I just need lunch.
It'll be great for next weekend. I mean, it'll be grrreat.
Well to tell you the truth, they uh, they had a problem with the bag!
Ugh!!
Umm, hi.
Look, Rach, Rach! I've been with my share of women. In fact, I've been with like a lot of people's share of women. The point is, I've never felt about anyone the way Ross felt about you.
All right, I'm here, let's ahh, get this over with.
What you-don't hold it like that! You're lettin' all the good stuff fall out.
Oh. Well good! For me. What is this? Did you give yourself a facial?
Yes! Guess who's in an audition for a Broadway musical?
Please!
Ross! Can I talk to you for a second?
There you go!
No. Y'know how we're always saying we need a place for the mail.
That's your move? Boy Rach, you're lucky you're hot.
Who's seven?
I do! So much! I can't stop thinking about her! I can't sleep, I-
What are we supposed to be seeing here?
Yeah. What are we getting?
Hey, look who's here! It's Joey, and he brought home a friend.
No plans, huh?
A little uh, good deed for PBS and a little TV exposure, now that's the kind of math Joey likes to do!
I can't believe she would say that too you.
I had to get out of the apartment. Janine is like stretching all over the place. Y'know, everywhere I look she's like...
No, no, that's not what I meant. Let's get you a cocktail.
Hey, don't get mad at us! No one forced you to raise the stakes!
Ooh, hey, I know how we can decide! All right, uh, I'm gonna ask you a bunch of questions and then you have to answer real fast. Okay? So uh, clear your mind Clear it right out! Clear it out! Clear!
You do?
What?!
I'm sorry, it just felt nice.
All right! There is something. I kinda had a dream, but I don't want to talk about it.
Hey, if anybody gets extra tickets, it should be me! This all thing was my idea!
Dude! What the hell are you doing?! God!
Err... I just figured it out! You know, I mean you're not working and the economy is bad.
Hey, this is a little extra somethin' for uh, ya know, always bein' there for me.
Okay. Okay. Ace!
Okay.
Yep.
Oh yeah! I got in there myself once. My roommate bet me five bucks that I couldn't, and then he stuck a board through the handles that locked me in. Yeah. It was funny 'til I started feeling like I was in a coffin.
Cat.
That's how they do pants! First they go up one side, they move it over, then they go up the other side, they move it back, and then they do the rear. What? Ross, Ross, would you tell him? Isn't that how they measure pants?
Hey Chandler can I talk to you for a second .
Yeah-yeah, he was playing blackjack for like an hour and he won $5,000. Can you believe that? $5,000!
Oh, it's a new TV show. Yeah. I'm up for the part of Mac Macaveli or "Mac." Yeah, I'm a detective and I solve crimes with the help of my robot partner. He's a, he's a Computerized Humanoid Electronically Enhanced Secret Enforcer or-or "C.H.E.E.S.E."
I could get a goose!
I'm Joey! I'm an actor! I don't know squat about dinosaurs!
It's OK!
Yeah-yeah I like that but just to go in another direction...
Y'know, if they knew what they were doing they probably didn't give you real names either.
All right. Hey Rach, while you're in there, throw something on Alicia Mae.
Yeah, me too.
It's Joey.
Yeah, the Knicks rule all!
Damnit!! Did you move?!
Never had that dream.
Hey Ross. This probably isn't the best time to bring it up, but you have to throw a party for Monica.
Hey you guys.
Oh okay, how about this one. I was gonna wait until the end of the night to kiss you, but you're so beautiful...I don't think I can.
Maybe he's. . . gay.
Come on Treeger, don't say that. You just ahh, you just need more practice. Here, come on, let's ahh, let's try it again. Come on. Plus, it was, it was probably mostly my fault, anyway. I mean, y'know, I'm not really that comfortable dancing with a- We-he!! Hey!
What?! I didn't touch a guitar!
Couldn't have this conversation down at the truck huh?
Aaahh... How much do I owe you?
Ah, well, if I want the girl to kiss me, first thing I do is make my lips look irresistible.
Ok.
Hey! How's it going?
And Chandler I can't believe I let you pay for this one. Thanks man.
What's wrong with the twentieth?
We can't do that.
Oh mama! Uh when-when is the baby due?
Oh, wish me luck!
Hey now!
Hi. We're the guys who called about the baby. We left the baby on ths bus. Is he here? Is he here?
No! No! No! For my new fridge-our new fridge!
All right, watch me! Okay, you time me. Ready?
Hey Pheebs!
I'm in it.
Hey, finished my recommendation. Here. And I think you'll be very, very happy. It's the longest I ever spent on a computer without looking at porn.
Ohh.
So?
And while we're down at the video store, you know what else we could rent? Die Hard! Oh, y'know what? I just remembered, that Everest thing is only available through mail order.
You hug me!
So what, like people are gonna come in and think, "Uh-oh, I'm outside again?" Of course!
No, but I'm gonna!
Whoa!! Now look, don't be just blurtin' stuff out. I want you to really think about your answers. Okay?
Okay.
Sorry.
Okay. I will. Ohh! Check out what they got me to wear for the ceremony! Huh? I wear it like this when I marry you guys, and then this is for party time.
Yeah! But if would've know what kind of friend you were gonna turn out to be, I wouldn't have worried about it so much! See you around!
No, couldn't care less.
Ascot!
Okay, how did this even happen?
Oh my God! That's great! Congratulations! What's the story?!
Dahhhhh!! No! Noooo!!
Yeah, maybe.
Well then, do it better!
You went through my personal property?
Really?
I don't feel like talkin.
But he's the same.
And-and-and-and-and the toothpicks?
Wow, is this friendship? I think so. Check it out, we're bracelet buddies.
Ok. Well, how, how can we make it easier?
Oh, oh! Maybe we can lure them out. You know any birdcalls?
I can't! Y'know? You guys don't know what it's like to put yourself out there like that and just get shot down.
It'll kill him. I mean it'll, it'll just kill him.
Yeah. I understand. I understand. Man, I wish I saw Phoebe first!
Yeah-eah! 200 dollar reward, split five ways!!
So, did you bring a little something for Ross?
So...I've never played that!
Look, Ross, I feel really bad. I mean, you're going through all this stuff and I just acted like a jerk.
And-and-and not only that, I'm gettin' a new brain!!
Yeah, he's the best.
No! No, I-I just wanna thank you guys for what you did for my parents, that was really sweet. They're so happy they get to be a part of your special day.
It is so amazing to meet you. I'm such a big fan of your work.
Awww, man! He promised he wouldn't take the chairs!!
So you've just married the one time then?
Oh, I-I, I think that's the first time I ever missed a meal! Yeah, my pants are a little loose!
Hey, don't get mad at us! No one forced you to raise the stakes!
How little are they? I mean, are they like scary little?
I can't write! Y'know I mean I-I-I'm an actor, I don't have the discipline that takes, y'know? I can't do it.
Okay, great.
Wow! I'm so sorry; I had no idea it would bother you this much.
Uh, I get Leslie out of the coma and then we make out.
Can't really say!
Oh. Ohh. Ohh, you're out of your mind.
Yeah! You did! And that's why I'm leaving.
Uhhhh.... he's not even wearing a jockstrap!
Thank you. Wait wait wait wait, you see me again. Hang on, the guy's butt's blockin' me. There I am, there I am, there I am, there I am, there I am. . .
You think?
WATER BALLOON!
Hey, you're Mike's parents, right?
...I'm his
Uh yeah, where-where's the guy who decides who's pictures go up on the wall?
Hey, Felicity.
Hey, Pheebs!
Oh, Chandler.
Hey, Rach, how you doing with The Shining?
Je te flouppe Fli.
Home is Home Star stew.
In my spare time I uh, read to the blind. And I'm also a mento for the kids. Y'know a mento, a role model.
I'm thinking we've got a bookcase here.
That's some gentle comedy, dude.
Monica. Oh... huh, I always thought it would be Rachel.
Hey! Here's the birthday boy! Ross, check it out: hockey tickets, Rangers-Penguins, tonight at the Garden, and we're taking you.
You can come in, but your filter-tipped little buddy has to stay outside!
Well, then it wouldn't be a secret. So yeah, that would be okay. Yeah. Yeah!
Well, Estelle tried, you know. The casting director told her that I missed my chance.
Sure, I know lots of girls.
Oh well, you're timing couldn't be better. I am putting out fires all over the place.
Okay, fine, I will bring you a tape, huh?
Judge rules, no violation.
Na-uh! Hey did anybody lose their keys?
Ok!
Oh this is great! I might actually get to play Ben's dad!
And what?! Did you sleep with her?!
He hooked up! He hooked up with someone.
What you do mean?
Let me explain to you how the human body works. I have to warm my stomach first. Eatin' chips is like stretching.
No, Rach, I should've told you sooner. It's just that...Man! That kid is going to town!
So uh listen, I think I'm gonna take off now.
What else?
Yeah, I want my tickets too ! And I'm buying the Knicks! And Steffi Graff, ah ah!
Right, right, right, well, she wants to go to all this cultural places and I don't know how to talk about that stuff. You gotta help me out!
Seriously?
Yeah, this slow roasted salmon, just how slow are we talkin' here?
That's great. But uh, I'm not really expecting a lot of calls.
....Are we still talking about sex?
It's the Knicks!
Yeah well next thing you know, he'll be telling you that your high heels are good for his posture!
Nice. Oh hey, what about Ross?
Well, okay, I'll - I'll just call her and tell her the date's cancelled, and find him somebody else.
I need to talk to you about Charlie.
Half the taste is in the smell! You-you're sucking up all the tastiness!
That's right I am!
Great! Thanks! You're gonna love her so much. And-Oh, she's the smartest of all the Tribbiani children. Hey, y'know the S.A.T's?
Ahoy!
Well, I couldn't do it. I told her I didn't want to get the part that way.
Anybody want to say good-bye to me at the car?
There will come a time in each of your careers when you'll have a chance to screw over another soap opera actor. I had such an opportunity in the recent, present. And I'm ashamed to say that I took it, I advised a fellow actor to play a role, homosexually. Yeah, we both auditioned for the part, and uh, as it turned out, they ah, they liked the stupid gay thing and cast him. And now, he's got a two year contract opposite Susan Luchhi, the first lady of daytime television, and me, me I'm stuck here teaching a bunch of people, most of whom are too ugly to even be on TV. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Thank you.
Yeah! We are!
All right look, let me show you the catalog! See? Huh? It's the latest thing! Everyone's got one! Men! Women! Children! Everyone's carrying them!
Doesn't seem like it's going to work, I mean...
Morning. Here you go.
Hey! Where have you been?
Oh, she's putting Emma down, she'll be over in a second.
I won, hey!
Yeah.
Put it on.
What?!
Alright, well the rest of you get comfortable, ok, because we're gonna be here for a li... Wait a minute, there is a window in there!
So...What?
I'll be playing Drake Remoray's twin brother, Stryker!
Well, this-this-this was great. Didn't everybody have a great time?
Catwoman, hands down.
Hey, Phoebe, I asked you, and you said it was okay.
No, no. Nurse With Tray doesn't know Joey, she doesn't have time for friends. She gets in that operating room and she carries that tray to the doctor, because if she doesn't, people die!
Thank you!
Hey, what if I said, I could even things out for ya, meatwise.
Ah-ah-ah Mr. Smartie Pants, it's just not my character that's not brain dead. Hey, so Pheebs, we still on for tonight?
Tribbiani.
No one.
What? Are you referring to my man's bag? At first, I thought it just looked good, but it's practical too. Check it out! It's got compartments for all your stuff! Your wallet! Your keys! Your address book!
Now, here's a picture of my mother and father on their wedding day. Now you tell me she's not a knockout.
Yeah, but for a one-year-old. What's the point... the other day she laughed for like an hour at a cup. Just a cup with a picture of Elmo on it dressed as a farmer. And he's standing next to this cow and the cow says "El-moo"! Yeah... that's a funny cup!
Hey, I'm with you. He even asked me if I thought you'd go out with him.
Uh-huh! I know. I'm coming soon to a theater near you! I'm in THX! I'm unsuitable for children!
Okay.
Look, I'm sorry I didn't tell ya. I'm sorry man.
Y'know, I can see why you think that, but ah, actually, you know who I think it is?
Come on baby, don't go. Please? What do you say?
Uh, Pheebs we kinda need you to drive us all up there in your grandmother's cab, but y'know what, I'll stay.
Well, you suck! But at least you suck at a man's game now.
Check.
What are you talking about? Keep it!
Oh yeah, yeah.
Yeah.
Listen, uh, I don't know when I'm gonna see you again.
Dude, stop talking crazy and make us some tea!
I know, I know! What am I going to do? Ooh!
I don't need that anymore.
Uh...Cookie?
So then how could you I mean, how could you?!
Goo, goo, goo, waaah!
Actually, technically, I didn't.
Chandler?
I want you to take this seriously! Phoebe is very very important to me, ok? And I wanna make sure that you are gonna take care of her.
Hey.
You don't kiss your friend's mom! Sisters are okay, maybe a hot-lookin' aunt... but not a mom, never a mom!
Yeah, we set up a court in your room. Uh, you didn't really like that grey lamp, did you?
That's the best birthday ever.
Are you kidding me?! She's gonna this boat!
You don't drink.
But I made cards!!
That guy's like a cartoon. What do you see in him anyway?
Hey I was crying because, because nobody believed Quincy's theory. Okay?
So spooky, that's all.
Ugh. Now if a cow should die of natural causes, I can have one of those right?
Yeah, I called the lady about that. I told her I was just joking. She was pretty nice about that.
Y'know I blame Ross for this.
What they're not invited?! Oh no, that's terrible! They're gonna be crushed!
I know, and only one layer of jam?! What is up with that?
Not in my head.
All right, relax. It's just a shoe.
I put it on to scare Chandler!
What? You never said anything about an audition!
Well sure, you name a kid that, what do you expect them to grow up to be?
Hey you guys, this is my agent, Estelle.
Aww. Ohh!
Heh, heh. It was nothin'.
I don't think so.
Good-good, okay, sprinkle some of that on your legs, it'll absorb some of the moisture and then you can get your pants back up.
You are not at Thanksgiving?
Chandler, come on, you're gonna find somebody.
And for Ross, Mr. Sweet-tooth.
Uh, she's with me. Dr. Drake Remoray.
Hey.
I know, it was the best I could get out of them.
Oh, you will when I pick you as starting forward.
It's kind of embarrassing, y'know. I mean, I was an actor and now I'm a waiter. It's supposed to go in the other direction.
Why do I smell men's cologne?
That's her! Okay, come on!
I don't want to. You do it!
It's not what you said. It's the way you said it... Oh My God, I'm a woman!!!
Oh. How-how big is that?
Yeah okay. Even though my tax dollars paid for this car.
Are you thinking about Monica?
Go get 'em Treeger.
Well you-you-you-you might say congratulations! I saw the board! I went to the audition! I got the part!!
She's this really boring woman. She's a teacher!
I did. I thought it'd be great. I figured I'd have like, time alone with my thoughts but, ya know, it turns out I don't have as many thoughts as you'd think.
Goodnight.
What's going on?
Well, I can't do everything! Look back over your time together.
I-I wasn't in that.
Yeah?
No, it's just my luggage.
All right, I'm sorry. Rach I-Rach I'm sorry. Okay? I'm sorry! Maybe I can make up for it by, taking you roughly in the barn.
That's what this is about! Oh my God, you hate Ross!
I wish I could but I just found out that I have to be at work really early the next day, so I can't go, but, you know, take the extra ticket and invite whoever you want.
Hey!
Well, with Dr. Drake they always tell me what to say. And with Joey, I pretty much have to make it up on my own.
Yes you are. I think it may be time for my sponge bath. Sorry, I'm just so used to hitting on the extras. So, are you excited about your scene?
Hey listen, so when's-when's my audition? I mean I know it's Thursday, but what time?
Good, and hey! My treat. But that's only because you're not eating anything, right?
Oh, I love you too.
Well y'know, I've been walking the same way since high school. Y'know, y'know how some guys they walk into a room and everybody takes notice. I think I need a 'take notice' walk.
Hey. I was just gonna get something to eat. You want something?
Maybe you'll order a little sangria?
Who do you think its from?
All right. But if you weren't my best friend.
Hey, you guys! Take a look at this! Check this baby out, dug me a hole!
Listen I uh... It's a scary world out there especially if you're a single mom. Y'know, I always felt like you and I have this-this special bond. Y'know? So, Rachel Green will you marry me?
Ohhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!
Hey, I don't need violence to enjoy a movie. Just so long as there's a little nudity.
Hey!
...Ninety-five, ninety-six, ninety-seven. See, I told you! Less than a hundred steps from our place to here.
Well, it looks like it wasn't heeled after all! Yeah! So, I guess this chair is mine now!
Yeah.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no... I think it's better if you tell him, you know. It's easier for a woman. That way, you know, if he gets mad, all you have to do is go... I didn't mean it. I'm so so--ooory.
Ok, ok, How about if we split it?

Hey.
Uh! That's a tough one. Oh! Wait a minute, this happened to me before! Yeah, I was auditioning for a play and the producer fell asleep and... no wait a minute... it was me who fell asleep... Yeah I mean hey, Shakespeare, how about a chase scene once in a while!?
Yeah, then-then who's the guy that painted the faces on the mountain?
Well, this guy came by to look at the unit and-and he said he didn't think big enough to fit a grown man!
Fan out! Fan out!
Wow Dennis Phillips! That's great! How did you guys meet?
You don't own a TV? What's all your furniture pointed at??
I said I think you're hot and now I'm embarrassed.
NO! No-no-no-no-no-no! Hey! Hey, we'll be fine! Li... hey, like you said: no big deal!
Okay, Ross, I realise that you didn't expect to walk in and see that, but.. Let me explain, okay?
I, I don't get you. I mean first, you hate me. Then you sleep with me. Then you want nothing to do with me, now you want me again.
Hey Monica, what's on this video tape?
You cooked him?
Damnit!
Right. Goodbye Erica, good luck in Salem. Take care
Joey's your best friEnd. You want to make him a cheese sandwich everyday. And you also want to buy him hundreds of dollars worth of pants.
I don't know. You uh, you got something for me?
Hey! Don't do the crime if you can't do the time.
I got a gig!
Doctor? Wow! I didn't know he had a nickname.
no... hmmmmm... it's not... hmmmmmmmmmm.
Oh, they cut me out of the show.
Ohh yeah, that's the stuff.
Monkey lover!
Hey!
Okay fine! I'm a seven! All right, I have surprisingly small feet. But the rest of me is good, I'll show ya!
Yeah.
Uh, listen I gotta double check for tickets tonight. Who-who got what?
Whoa.
Uh, well, kinda yeah. Like, remember last week when Alex was in the accident? Well the line in the script was, 'If we don't get this woman to a hospital, she's going to die.' But I made it, ' If this woman doesn't get to a hospital, she's not gonna live.'
Hey.
There's gravy?
Joey.
Yeah! A little bit, yeah...
And remember whatever comes up first. Okay? And hurry, because ...
In Bizarro World!! You broke the code!
Hey, it's me! I'm comin' in!
Hey!! We are so in luck! Treeger said that we could have all this cool stuff from the basement. Wait right there.
But it's dark out.
Yeah, I know exactly what she's goin' through.
CURIOUS GEORGE ! You know, the monkey, and the guy with the yellow hat!
Actually, tomorrow night kinda depends on how tonight goes.
Get out!!
Ah.
Two days ago.
No, I-I miss hanging out with you.
Yeah?
Well, there were a couple of calls last night, but ah, I don't think any of them are gonna work out.
Yeah!
Cool.
This thing welded shut?!
Hey! It's my fashion girls! What's wrong?
I, um, can't tell you.
What did you say to him?
Oh, I will.
Marcel?
So whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! What are you gonna do? You're gonna have the baby and-and raise it by yourself...without a husband?! You can't be a single mother alone! You're gonna ruin your life!
Wow! You realize that we've been throwing this ball, without dropping it, for like an hour?
So you uh, still wondering?
Hey! Tag's still talking to the police.
Dude relax! It could happen to anyone.
Why is 10 the highest?
Thanks, Rach. Look, you guys are just terrific. Y'know? Now, how about clearing out of here so I can get some new customers. It's all about turnover.
Thanks for stopping by. See ya! I-I am so sorry. I...
Hey, Monica, who would yours be?
Uh yeah-ye-ye-ye-ye-ye-l-l-l-l-l-look the-the-the only reason that I, that I came up to you before was because well, I'm really nervous about-about being you. Y'know if you can help me capture the essence of the character. Y'know? Help me keep Jessica alive. Please?
Hi, Rach.
Really? That's great! You and my sister, sittin' in a tree.
For Ross.
Hey!
aaw-ahhh-aaahhh STOP! STOP! I'm worried about damaging my head.
Yeah, she is. Wow! How you doin'?
Hey, yo.
Okay, now. I gotta tell you, being on TV isn't as glamorous and exciting as you think.
You know, the baby can't read, Mike!
Yes, it's a highly controversial procedure.
Yeah?! So's yours!
See, this is why I don't date women who read. Uh-oh.
Oh, great, pretty soon they'll be back together.
Yeah, I thought I was pretty good too.
Oh, here's where I win all my money back!
That's not a bad idea. Yeah. Okay, but if I got to turn on the charm tomorrow I'm not wasting anymore of it over here with you guys. Well, actually I got a little bit saved for you Pheebs.
Big day.
No-no-no, no, no, wait. You see, I'm an actor, Joey Tribbiani, I'm doing a scene with you today, and well, I stink.
Oh, oh, oh... What a dog says.
Whoa! What are you doing here? How did your date go?
Of course! Only an idiot would wear this stuff if you didn't have the car! Right?
I got it! Here we go.
.....Well, this is still ruined, right?
Hey Erica, c'mon in.
Hey.
Yeah.
I don't know, but it sounds great.
So uh, hey, that uh, that wedding ring, huh? Man, that's nice!
I didn't know that! Well, what a pretty last name!
Yeah, sure. Well, you must be new here. Maybe we should-I'm sorry, can I ask you something?
Have a seat. Last night, I tried to welcome you into my family... and instead, you disrespect me... I cannot allow this.
Okay, this is gonna be tough. Hold your breath.
Hey!
Because you waited too long to make your move, and now you're in the friend zone.
Okay!
I don't know! Maybe she's crazy!
Yeah. All right, now give me your best shot.
Hey, it's gonna be all right.
I didn't tell him. I didn't know if you were telling people. This is back when I thought Kash was still people.
Oh! I see what happened. It's because I was trying to repel you. Right? Believe me, you'd feel a lot different if I turned it on.
Yeah...
Fortune! This guy is so stupid. It's Count Rushmore!!
All right, I guess I can hold out a little longer. Let's have a game.
Okay. And uh, are you married.
Exactly.
That's right, yeah.
All right, well first of all I would like to say that you both performed very well. Okay? You should be proud of yourselves. And-and I would also like to say that in this competition there are no losers. Well, except for Rachel-Damnit!
Oh. What?
Rachel stuff.
But plus, it would be wrong and weird and-and-and bad.
I'm sorry. I'm 28 years old, I've never lived alone, and I'm finally at a place where I've got enough money that I don't need a roommate anymore.
What the hell is that?!!
And the winner is...Joey Tribbiani! Oh... Wow! I honestly never expected this. I uh, I didn't prepare a speech. But umm, I'd like to thank my parents, who've always been there for me. I'd also like to thank my friends, Chandler, Monica, Phoebe, Rachel...
Huh. So then I can heat this up?
Yeah? That's so nice!
Oh, it was so amazing. After the love making...
Back when you and Rachel were together, if Chandler had kissed her, would you hear him out?
All right! So that's it! It's over! Everybody knows!
Yes!!! Ha-ha-ha!
Uh, y'know what, we're having second thoughts about our copying needs. And we'll need a little more time to think about it.
So, so, what'd ya think?
Oh it was great. Yeah, you get to say stuff like, 'Hey, the bell doesn't dismiss you, I dismiss you.'
Sure, no problem. Ooh-Hey, donuts!
Is that a sandwich?!
Oh, I didn't go to college.
I wanted to go to the strip club!
I gotta say, I never knew I could enjoy the non-sex part of the date so much.
You got it. Thanks man. Thanks for doing this, I owe you one. Oh, hey! There wasn't any change from that twenty, was there?
Sure. So how long you been...
I can't! It-it's stuck!
Yeah, so it turns out that it wasn't the hair straightener that started the fire. No-no, it was the candles. It's very not good leaving candles unattended. In fact, one of the first things they teach you in fire school is... Uhh... Uhh... Okay. Well, I have to go now.
Everybody smile! Okay, thanks a lot! Enjoy your stay at Caesar's! We hope it's toga-rrific! Kill me. Kill me now.
Would you guys want to come down tomorrow and watch me tape the show?
Real estate, huh? Hmmm...
Hey! We were just sayin', great apartment man.
Dude, you see right thru me!!
Oh, come on Rach! My turn just started!
I'm 30!
Look, you wanna use our place?
Hey, I'm not interested in her sweater! It's what's underneath her sweater that counts. And besides, since ah, since when do you care who I'm going out with?
Uhhh, I don't think you're gonna like this.
I had a dream once about a fax machine that did that.
Oh, Richard's here. I should run down say bye to him
Well, I was trying to figure out how to get to Buckingham Palace, right? So, I'm in my map and-and... Hey!
No seriously... I'm really wedged in here.
She is so hot!
No, we're alright.
Yes! Yes, you're back in the lead!
Oh, oh, oh, sorry.
That's better, now just bend your arms a little more. There you go. Okay, look straight ahead. Now this time I want you to really put your ass into it.
Hey, you know about that?!
I mean naked game. Strip poker, we should totally play strip poker.
The fruit roll up.
Look, we are not gonna...
Sure, now I'm scared.
Oh yeah, yeah, she's great, but... I kinda got the feeling that she was sort of... coming on to me. And I definitely would get the part if I would've... you know... if I would have sent the Little General in.
So, what, you think I'm just gonna sleep with her and never call her again and things are gonna get uncomfortable? Yeah, sounds about right.
Right. Dja bu bu Claude. Uh, c'est la pu les la lu blah bloo.
Way to go robot!
How is it you?
Well, it's complicated. She's with this other guy. For a long time. Someone from work, too. And I could never do that to the guy, because we're really good friends.
Chandler gave me word of the day toilet paper. I'm gonna get some coffee.
Pheebs, if this guy keeps closing down all of our favorite places, where are we gonna eat?!
Y'know, I'd walk back to London for another frosty one of those bad boys.
We have a half hour.
Ross, you need some help?
Yeah, try sticking it in the freezer for 20 minutes. I'm tellin' ya!
Ross. I was thinking we could just go down the fire escape.
Hey.
All right! I'll have a sandwich!
I want to do it again.
Okay, really good. Anyway I gotta go; I'm late for work.
Uh, Rachel's here, so good luck man, let me know how it works out.
Hey-hey, what's going on?
Hi!
Hey uh, what's a matter?
That's fire. Beats everything.
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Look. I take a girl out, she can order whatever she wants! The more, the better! All right? Just don't order a Garden salad and then eat my food! That's a good way to lose some fingers!
I've got Ben.
I don't know how to lead.
Uh, you gotta press the button.
Yeah.
Uh, yeah but uh, I may have said those things before but, I never truly meant them. Until now.
That'll be $3.85.
Alright, so...so tell me one of your moves.
I guess so. I'm just... really nervous.
Hey.
Huh?
No, I gotta wear this thing for a couple weeks.
No.
Rach?! Rachel!!!!? So I can't do anything I like????
Oh yeah, that's just a little something for my huge gay fan base.
I don't know! But it's the same!
And you're Okay with that?
The Red Ross! Okay.
Of course!
Okay.
That's a huge thing!
Hey! Tall guy! Hey, listen, I wanted to talk to you about that girl that you're dancing with.
I can't. It's like this chemical thing, you know. Every time she starts laughing, I just wanna pull my arm off just so that I can have something to throw at her.
You do?
Come on, please, it'll be just this one more, well actually it's two.
Keep going Pinocchio!
Yes, I'm afraid it is. You deserve much better than me Erica. You deserve to be with the real Drake, he's the one you fell in love with. Go to Salem, find him, he's the guy for you.
No, no, it's not, don't listen to him! I'm gonna thump you!
At least I care about his feelings!
Yeah well that's because uh...I stayed in my room. Yeah, you don't want to look in my hamper.
Yeah, right!.......Y'serious?
Yeah. Listen to the slutty nurse.
What?
A spoon. Your hands. Your face!
Bijan for men? Bijan for men? Bijan for... Hey, Annabelle, Uh, listen, I was wondering if maybe after work you and I could go maybe grab a cup of coffee.
Hey no, seriously, I don't need you to pick me... Alright! It still works.
It's not on my head.
Well Ross, what did you think she was gonna do?
But it is a big deal!! I have to tell someone!
Yeah, why don't you move in with me? It'll be great! We could stay up late, watch movies, and you know about Naked Thursday's right?
Oh yeah? And who do you like?
In a carriage!
This is embarrassing.
Oh my God, quick turn off the TV.
Did you get it?
Uhh do you happen to have a hot girl in there?
Wait-wait-wait-wait! Come on! Come on, let's trade! The timing's perfect, I just clogged the toilet!
Alright... I've got to go shower.
What?
Hey, I see you guys already met, huh?
Nope.
Hey, this is ridiculous. I'll tell you what. After I get back from my neice's christening, I'll go down to the coffee house with you and we'll all have a nice cup of coffee alright. No problem, Joey's there.
You're kiddin'.
Yeah!
Yeah, sure. Go ahead. Oh, me, right!
Okay, so-so which route should I take the northern route or the southern route?
Hey, who wants to ah, throw the ball around a little, maybe get a little three on three going?
Err...Well I...Know how much you used to make and I know how much your rent is.
Yeah, sorry, the swallowing slowed me down.
Hey Terry!
Oh my God!
Oh-ooh-ooh! Y'know what's a good visual aide?
Get out of the corner. Pass it, pass it.
Hey.
I dunno!
Both of us?
No, no. He said "When are you gonna grow up and start being a mom?"
Yes! And the table is mine.
All right.
Hey. So where's Mon?
It's like, you got so many lines to learn so fast, that sometimes you need a minute to remember your next one. So while you're thinkin' of it, you take this big pause where you look all intense, you know, like this.
Come on you guys, we want you to know we're very very sorry. Right guys?
If anything should happen to him...
I'm up all night!
Yeah.
Hey!
How?! When?!
No. no... eh... she went shopping with Rachel. Why? What's up?
What?
Oh-no, don't try and talk all normal with that thing in your ear.
Yep.
Ohh, you know what it is? It's smudgy 'cause they're fax pages. Now when I was on Days of Our Lives as Dr. Drake Remoray, they'd send over the whole script on real paper and everything.
That's right! And what are you not gonna do?
Oh! It all looks so beautiful: the turkey, the stuffing...
Hey! Who was up from 2 o'clock this morning until 5 o'clock this morning trying to get her back to sleep?
I don't know.
Hey guys!
Naa, they said that when they found my body, my brain was so smashed in that the only doctor that could have saved me was me. Supposed to be some kind of irony or somethin.
How come you have two?
I know, I know, but look at the knobs on her.
No.
What the hell am I supposed to do!
Dude, I'm sorry. But hey, there's one spot left, right?
It's stuck!!!
I was tired!
Big fat goalie.
All right, all right, all right, all right, you wanna know what I do when I take resume shots?
Okay! Here we go. Pillow.
No.
Ma?
But it is our apartment!
Hey-hey-hey, if my friend says it's time to go, it's time to go.
Hey, you guys are still gonna come visit me, right?
Well I uh, got what I came for. I'll uh, I'll see you guys.
Ah, anything we might of heard of?
Come on Ross! Look, I-I don't have any brothers; I'll never get to be a best man!
Leetch spots Messier in the crease- there's the pass!
Where do you think, Zelda?
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!! None of that, not while you're living under my roof!
Ok, you're gonna come back with some very classy clothes... ... and some slutty lingerie, SLUTTY!
Yes!
They want me to be totally naked in the movie!
What?!
Yeah, but after Denise DeMarco, I had to promote it.
How is "Monica, I love your sweet ass," inappropriate?
Well I guess I should've thought about my wife and kids before I talked back to chef Geller!
Oh, come on! Have you seen what my kid can do?! Huh?! I mean he dials phones! He-he-he eats tortilla chips! He-he plays soccer with the cartoon tiger!
Well uh...I think I want to take Chandler.
No, I'm not sleeping with your friend Jane again.
What!? But I already bought my ticket to Bermuda!
And before you know it, she's with him. And you'll be all, 'Ohh, man!' And he'll be all, 'Yes!' And us, we'll be like, 'Wh-whoa, dude.' And pretty soon you'll be like, 'Hhiii,' and, and, and, 'I can't go, Rachel and Mark might be there.' And we'll be like, 'Man get over it, it's been four years!!'
All right, all right, all right. I mean I'll have to check with him first, but I'll think he'll be cool with it.
Come in. Thanks for comin' back, umm, okay there have been a lot of people interested in the room, but I have narrowed it down and you are one of the finalists!
