Hello to the rest.
She may have died.
Okay, okay take a guess.
Chandler's gonna ask Monica to marry him!
But-but, Liam's on my team.
That's not a thing!
....right? Right? I mean it's pretty unbelievable y'know, I mean they just took off, took off without even looking back. Y'know I don't, I don't need them, huh, I've got you guys now as friends, you and Susan.
Hi.
Hey-hey Pheebs!
The physical act of love.
No! And I'm not gonna be, so you can save you little speech.
WHAT THAT'S A REAL NAME!
Most of you don't know me, I'm Rachel's boyfriend.
Okay, but do you really need another friend? I mean...
Ok.
Hey! Hey! If he's moving, maybe I should try to get his place!
Okay, I'm gonna play my sperm card one more time.
You, you sure you need shoes? Okay.
Oh. Hel-lo!
What?! Why?!
You were in a porno?
I swear!
No, no, I mean, ya know, I, I read a book and there was a girl named Emily and I thought, I thought that might be good.
Dude, what am I gonna...
Hey!
Ahem... I want.... OK, I want to... feel your... hot, soft skin with my lips.
Oh, see from where I was sitting I uh. . .
Mon?
Okay.
Excellent! How do you put a baby down for a nap?
Know what-If somebody doesn't tell me what's going on right now...
Oh, no, it's no big deal, I mean, if I weren't doing this I'd just, you know, be at the gym working out.
'Cause Carol's a lesbian. And, and I'm not one. And apparently it's not a mix and match situation.
What-why?
Hey!
I'm sorry, I don't believe contestants are allowed to talk to each other.
Wha... what you really think we can do that?
Ah, it's good. It's going good. I mean, we get along great. She's, she's so...
Look Rach if-if you want to go for a ride in the Porsche I'll be glad to take you for a quick spin around the block.
Oh, is that funny?! Oh, you-you find that funny?! Well maybe Chandler should know some of your secrets too!
Hey. Rachel, I-I-I've been wanting to tell you something for a while now and I really, I just have to get it out.
It's alright, it's no big deal.
Well hey! What's going on? Ooh, cool boat--Oh, no. Hey, did you, did you tell them?
Pheebs, we had the most incredible night! Okay, so, we're in the car...
Why... I... I don't know. Uhm... errrr... maybe... maybe because of my father?
Hey!
Ugh.
Fine.
Aw, he's gonna be so happy.
Wow. Umm... Huh... I'm-I'm not sure what to do with that right now.
That's great! Are you happy now? Look what you did with your funny, funny form!
Rach we have a code brown situation.
Blah blah blah, blah blah blah... blah blaaaaaah....
Hey.
Come on! All the cool kids are eating 'em!
Joshua...guy at that club, dancing and having a good time, the thought of it kinda...y'know.
Whoa-whoa-whoa!
Can I come over tomorrow and pick up Fluffy Meowington's cat toy.
Oh! Got 'em right here, check!
I have to talk to her about this groomsman situation, ok? I'm not gonna watch Chandler up there while I'm sitting in the seats like some chump! . Oh! My God! You're breathtaking!
Chandler-
That's okay.
Bye Janine!
Yeah-yeah you guys. Get out of here!
I guess so.
You may want to lose the foam finger!
It's a big deal to me. This is great, Monica. I really appreciate this.
Oh, great. Great. There was a projectile, uh, throwing up incident, but he started it.
Hey!
Hey, hey, woah, you want some of this, huh? You want a piece of this, huh? I'm standin here, huh.
No.
Actually, do you guys mind staying here for a while?
Anyway it-it kinda-it all boils down to this, the last time I talked to Emily...
Yeah, the phone was facing the other way. And that goes back up there.
Need some help?
Of... of what?
Oh sure.
Yeah.
Why?! Why on the lips?!
So suck it up man, it's a job, it's money.
She's having lunch with him. She's having lunch with him. And you should of seen the hug she gave him when she got the job. And, and, and, he's really good looking. What am I gonna do?
Well why not?! She'll-she'll love it! It's the real thing! I got it at Pottery Barn.
But, um... I don't think that's going to be you.
So, uh, he's back.
I talked to Monica, look, I'm the one who made the choice. I'm the one who's making things change, so I should be the one to y'know, step back.
Uh, Pheebs, some people call that breaking and entering.
Yeah, I really do. Yeah, but what am I gonna do, I mean we-we both agreed that it was gonna be a two-week thing, y'know no commitment.
It doesn't matter! It's my principles! We're talking about my principles!
Okay-okay! Two very good points, look I've known you both a long time, and I've never seen either of you one/millionth as happy as you've been since you've got together. Do you really want to throw that all away over a room? That is so silly. Now wh-what is more important, love or silliness?
Oh, be-because of the leather pants.
What?
Oh man.
Of course I am! Okay, let's go godfather.
What. Oh no, you just rolled over the juice box.
Tony?
Oh, and also, he's, he's walkin' kind of funny, his left leg is moving a lot faster than his right leg, and he's in there just sort of y'know...
That's, that's pretty. Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What are you doing there Gert?
Because, it's weird!
She says Marcel's humping thing's not a phase. Apparently he's reached sexual maturity.
Well, I came with Rachel, who should be back any second! So what's new?
Rachel! What are you doing here?
Phoebe, what happened?
Alright. : Your money's mine, Green.
Ok, bye. Well, Monica's not coming, it's just gonna be me and Rachel.
What is it?
Do you have a point?
I had no idea. And that-that pillowcase thing, I thought you guys were just doing the flying nun.
Oh, right!
Waitohheyhuh, oh great now he knows, and I don't know!
Oh yeah! So ah, kinda pretty, pretty good. He sounds like a nice, good guy.
Y'know what? Maybe, Mrs. Green, it's not absolutely vital that you live with us.
Joey! Hey, I need to talk to Charlie. Is she there?
We have to stop them before something happens!
We have 8:00 reservations at Grammercy Bistero.
Oh mom! Okay, umm, her name is Carol. And she's really pretty. And smart. And uh, she's-she's on the lacrosse team and the golf team. Can you believe it? She plays for both teams!
Oh, 's'funny, really? Um, I don't remember you making any sperm.
Chandler, can I just say something? I-I know you're still mad at me, I just wanna say that there were two people there that night. Okay? Two sets of lips.
Somewhere maybe along the equator?
Yeah. Anyway umm, it probably worked out for the best.
Ok, Phoebe, this is it. In this briefcase I carry actual scientific facts. A briefcase of facts, if you will. Some of these fossils are over 200 million years old.
Shut up! It was nice. I just... I don't think I'm the dirty-talking kind of guy, you know?
Here it comes.
Rachel won't talk to me! She won't even open the door!
Come on.
Ah. Joey you're-you're having lunch with my mom?
And hey, here's to a lousy Christmas.
What?
Oh, yeah, no problems. It's all taken care of.
It is time for you to give your maid of honor speech.
Hey, you gotta get Mom on the phone. Call Mom! Call Mom!
Calm down. There's no reason to get testy.
MY SANDWICH?!!!
Hey. We-we look...we look pretty good.
Okay! Ho-ho! We did not steal your thunder because we are not getting back together!
C'mon, you'll make a day of it! You'll rent a boat, pack a lunch...
We got a head, we got shoulders, we got arms, we got, oh, look at the little fingers, oh, and a chest, and a stomach. It's a boy, definitely a boy! All right! Ok, legs, knees, and feet. Oh, oh. He's here. He's a person.
No... No... No. I think I should stay, I think we should both know whats going on.
Okay, okay, okay. I'll get the bagels.
I don't know, are we just kissing guys on balconies?
Isn't Rachel supposed to be back by now?
This feels perfectly normal. Ok, get on the swing!
So, Rach, y'know-y'know how Emily's coming right?
of course she has. if she'd never had a serious relationship I'd go round broadcasting it like some unstoppable moron.
Look, this is just a little too familiar, okay? For like, for Like six months before Carol and I spilt up, all I heard was "My friend Susan is so smart. My friend Susan is so funny. My friend Susan is so great."
It uhh, it won't go back.
What? Hey, hey, listen..
Let me ask you something, at your school was there a like uh a place on campus where students went to uh, fool around.
I Know!
Oh, I thought it was just a kid yelling, "I'm gay! I'm gay!" Can I bring her in?
No! That would be stupid! You're having it for me!
Does that mean the same thing in England as it does in America?
That's okay. She's still in there enjoying her fake party and uh, it's too late to do any of the things I had planned, so...
Okay, it's not, it's not.
Oh, you've tasted it.
Yeah!
Emma.
What?
I don't think that your monologue from Star Wars is gonna help me right now, Joe!
Apparently, he told Johnny Shapiro that she's quite a girl. In fact, he told Johnny that he thinks he's falling in love with her.
People can hear you.
Is this?!
Yeah.
Ok, I gotta say. I mean, it means so much to me that you guys are coming all the way over there to hear me do my speech! UH! And I've a surprise, uh... I had to pull some strings but I was able to get everyone passes to the entire conference! That's right! This babies will get you into all the paleontology lectures and seminars.
No.
Yeah, um, okay see, you were, you were on the list but my friend, Chandler brought up the very good point that you are international, so I bumped you for Wynona Rider, local.
Anyway, so, uh, so what is it?
Get out.
Oh, come on, you know it's a girl!
Wow! You look nice. What's the occasion?
Yeah!!
Really? Did you count Mississipily?
How do you count to five?
Ooh. What is the name of Chandler's father's Las Vegas all-male burlesque?
Yeah!
Hey, if there is ever, anything I can do for you...
Look let's not make a big deal out of this! It was a one time thing. It doesn't even matter!
Better not be doin' these in order.
Well that I can believe.
I don't think so. Hello? When you get in there...
I- I think they're great! I, I really do.
Oh hey! Hey uh, you remember the necklace I gave you last year? Can I see it?
What, do you, well umm, oh how about I come up there?
Y'know, we work in a museum of natural history, and yet there is something unnatural about the way we eat lunch. Now, I look around this cafeteria, and y'know what I see, I see-I see division. Division, between people in white coats and people in blue blazers, and I ask myself, "My God why?!" Now, I say we shed these-these coats that separate us, and we get to know the people underneath. I'm Ross! I'm divorced, and I have a kid!
You gotta be at least bi...
Do them!!
Good night.
Good, so do I
Hey!
He said he liked that!! Oh you're right, you're right. I'm sorry.
Oh, it's not over!
That's right, Ben. I'm Santa's representative for all the southern states. And Mexico! But, Santa sent me here to give you these presents, Ben. Maybe the Lady will help me with these presents.
The judge wouldn't let us get an annulment! Now we gotta get a divorce!! Did a Porsch throw up on you?
I'm gonna get a new band-aid. Hey, how 'bout the time I cut the legs off your Malibu Ken?
Please take your time, it's an important decision. Not like, say, I know! deciding to marry someone, this is about a muffin.
Look, I didn't want to rush into anything. And it seemed like she didn't want to either. But I don't, I don't understand how any of this happened! What? Did she find the ring in my jacket, assume that I was going to propose, throw it on, and-and just start telling people?
Oh, why don't you make her one of your little jokes.
Monica? You're Mom.
What?! What does he want?! I wasn't doing anything!
Why, does it look like I'm having trouble with my misshapen claw?
The uh, the baby that hasn't been born yet? Wouldn't that mean you're... crazy?
No, why?
My uncle Marcel.
I don't, I don't think we've meet. I-I'm Ross.
Phoebe, you can't get out of this! Okay? You have to learn how to ride a bike!
Oh really? What uh, what does he want with her?
What?
Well, ya know, someone should have called me.
Yeah, yeah, oh!
I uh, I don't know, I guess I'm just gonna see, see what happens.
OK, here goes.
That's funny, that, no, because, uh, our parents actually did, uh, send our dog off to live on a farm.
150 dollars.
Look, I know what you're going through. When I turned 50 I got the Porsche. You... you got your own little speedster.
That's right. The student has become the master.
Ooh... so sad... Still, it can't be easy for you to leave Harvard? Especially after working alongside a Nobel Prize winner like Albert Wintermeyer?
Thanks.
I'm fine! Hey, I'm great! I'm just.. I'm just proud of us. There's no weirdness, no tension.
No, not a problem.
I uh... I don't know. I mean I...I honestly didn't watch it.
So what're you saying here? I should shave again, pick up some wine, what?
Hi!
I don't think so.
Well I checked in the uh, lost and found, I talked to the manager, no-one's turned them.
And officiating at tonight's blackout, is Rabbi Tribbiani.
What, the word hi?
No, actually I was just saying it looks like we're not sitting together. But now you mention it, there was ice there that night... It was the first frost...
Oh, nothing, it's just, it's close to Ron. Does he.. Does little Ross like dinosaurs by any chance?
OK. OK, this is a picture frame from Ben to my parents, huh.
"...and I'm a little bit rock 'n' roll"!
I'm sorry... we... we can't.
A no sex pact huh? I actually have one of those going on with every woman in America.
Yeah.
So uh, Emily just went to the airport.
Oh. Uhh...
Yeah, well what about you? You weren't you know, so hot in college either. After everything he said, he'd go "ba dum bum chessh"
Uhh, it was fun. We, we just had coffee.
Why- why are you here, Carol?
Then I'm happy too.
Ranion's theory of species variegation?
Hey.
That's impossible, he's got a twinkie in the city.
Remember the Russian satellite, Sputnik? Well, I'm a potato or a...spud. And these are my antennae. So Sputnik, becomes... Spud-nik. Spudnik!
Hey, I helped you find Waldo!
Uh, you know, you can't always get a seat on the subway, so...
Well? Isn't that amazing?
Look, I didn't recognize it without that inflatable sheep.
Still... this is amazing... Oh my god, thank you, Phoebe.
He won't? He won't! Because, isn't that, isn't that the, the short story you were writing?
Do they wait for me to do this?
I just wanted to tell you something before you heard it from someone else and I hope this isn't too weird, but uh, I had uh, a thing with Janice. What you're-you're not mad?
How do you know? You don't have a watch.
Oh, I will.
It's a little early to be drinkin'.
He's right, even if it's to say something complementary.
Rach?
Yep, can you believe it?
We, we just decided to uh, to go for it.
Good! A verbal contract is binding in the state of New York!
This is a girl that I really like and had too swoop in there!
I'll get it.
Yeah.
Seven.
It is. Eventually, it kind of... burns out. But hopefully, what you're left with is trust, and security, and... well, in the case of my ex-wife, lesbianism. So, you know, for all of those people who miss out on that passion... thing, there's all that other good stuff.
I told you there was going to be sub-titles.
Why don't you come, I mean, I-I have two tickets, why not?
No, God no! That is no place for a woman. Those guys will grab anything.
Sure, what do you got?
Come here, come here. Uh, ow! Emily, will you marry me?
No, no, no. That's impossible. It doesn't leave for another 20 minutes.
I chose those, I'm a paleontologist.
Well, Ben would be there.
Well, but, but. . .
Well, do you wanna marry him?
Uh yeah! Let me, let me get that for you.
Hello. Oh hi, are you on your way ove-. Oh. No, no, I, I understand, I mean a monkey's gotta work. No it, it's no big deal, it' not like I uh, had anything special planned. Yeah OK, OK. OK, OK, bye.
You know the song! Sing along!
Unbelievable! I mean you really kept Joey's underwear?! Why? Why would you do that?!
Take thee, Rachel... Emily. Emily.
Rachel! I'll just call her back.
Nice!
Hey!
Really? That's great!
Oh, hey, hey Rach, do you notice anything..ahh...
Yeah, but-but he didn't know that!
What's wrong with being the Bings?
Yeah.
Well, eww. What? Is it a pimple?
Good night.
All right, let's not jump to any conclusions. All right? There was some sexual chemistry between them.
Really? Well then tell it to me.
All right. Okay, here we go!
Ok, ok look, see, the thing is we're, we're not gonna fight you guys.
Aw, y'know...Y'know, maybe we're-we're just approaching this all wrong. If you're Chandler and-and you wanna hide, where is the last place on Earth people would think you'd go?
You like it?
I know.
Looks to me like he's the one getting the job.
Hi!
Which one was that?
You're just jealous because you couldn't pull this off. Yeah, now if you'll excuse me I have a date. See? ALL eyes on ME!
Oh I, I don't-I don't think that would be the best idea.
What? What? What?
Get away from me I said no!
Umm, candles, champagne, yeah anniversaries are great. 'Cause you know love lasts forever, y'know. Nothing like it in this lifetime, money in the bank, so Rachel and I broke up.
Okay, that's it. I cannot make this decision! It is too difficult, so I'm just gonna leave it entirely to the gods of fate.
Hey!
Everyone gets a goodbye but me? What have I got to do to get a goodbye, huh? Be best friends with you? Uh, go out with you? Have a baby with you? Oh wait a minute, wait a minute, I did all those things.
I'm familiar with his work, yes...
...desperate, needy, pathetic?
Come on! Like I wanted him to tell you, I ran all over the place trying to make sure that didn't happen!
Because I folded it up and put in my pants pocket. Do you...do you not look there?
Yeah.
No... I already e-mailed her.
Pretty soon I guess.
Hey, tell me again, what do I do when Mr. Roper calls?
Rachel, please...
Like 'em, like 'em? Or, I'd like to get store credit for that amount like 'em?
'The hills were alive with the sound of music.'
Well, I'm so excited about this.
Actually, nectarines, but basically...
What a weird way to kick me when I'm down.
I'm telling you, just a little bit at a time.
That's okay Rach, we're not liking Ross right now.
Look, if I can just do what Emily wants and get her to New York, I'm sure everything will be fine.
Who is he?
You know what the scariest part is? What if there's only one woman for everybody, y'know? I mean what if you get one woman- and that's it? Unfortunately in my case, there was only one woman- for her...
My mommies love me. That's clever.
What?
Wait! It was my plan.
Uh, yeah, yeah I'll, I'm right behind you.
Bye.
And his first name.
Here we go!
So, so, is Mike coming to dinner?
You don't have a valid driver's license-Okay that is it! Pull over right now!
Oh, fire! There, there's a fire! Fire!!
Rachel one brunch is not gonna solve anything. You gotta face it, okay we're never gonna get along.
What's that supposed to mean?
Sorry.
I'm getting married today!! Ahh, whoo-hoo!!
Well, I think it's perfect. Y'know, it's just gonna be the two of us, she spent all day taking care of my monkey...
Okay.
Great! Because people kept showing up, I think it's like uh-a thing!
Come on, seriously.
No-no.
The one with the cat. I gotta go, I've got another date.
Hello? Hey Mon, how's the packing going? Ben? He's fine. Yeah, he's right-Oh my God! Get your head of your shirt there son! What? Yeah, it's a pumpkin. I'll come pack.
WE WERE ON A BREAK!!!!!!!
It's okay man, be strong.
Oh, that's great, that is great!
Ah. Oh.
That's my favorite shirt! Okay? I love that shirt!
Well...
And thank you, for that.
You're excited, right?
Argh!
How could you tell her?!
Just then or-or all the time, 'cause we-we have jobs y'know.
Yeah?
The guy on the cover with his nipples showing?
Hey Pheebs! How's that uh, vegetarian pizza working out for ya? You and those vegetables have a real thing going on, huh?
No no, you're uh, you're my lobster. See um, lobsters, uhh, in the tank when, when they're old, uhh, they get with, uhh, they walk around holding the claws. In the tank, ya know, with, with the holding and. . . Uhh, Phoebs you wanna help me out with the, the whole lobster thing?
Yeah, that's it?
How could you not tell us?
What was with the dishes?
Wow, this is really soft . Three hundred and fifty dollars?
If only he were a woman.
...will be two months...
Yeah, I recognize the ankles!
Everything? Even the TV?
I didn't get a cat.
No, I've looked everywhere!
What. Oh no, you just rolled over the juice box.
No, no way. You've got it totally the other way around my friend. John Voit was...
No. Now maybe.
So uh... I guess I wanna take off.
Right! So when Rigby got his samples back from the laboratory he made a startling discovery! What he believed to be igneous, was in fact sedimentary. Imagine his consternation when- Oh bloody hell.
You want me to call her right now?
'That thing'? This is how you greet guests at a party? Let me ask you something, if I showed up here with my new girlfriend, she wouldn't be welcome in your home?
Oh, I'm just over here with Ben. I thought we'd say hi.
Yeah but, you know, now that I think about it, I don't think I've ever seen Fun Bobby without a... a drink in his hand.
What's up?
Noo!
Okay, you wanna play rough, we can play rough.
Y'know, she tried to undress me too.
Okay Pheebs, I know how we're going to figure this out. Okay, clear your mind and answer the first thing that comes into your head. Okay?
Y'know what? Uh, Rachel is here!
I got tenure. I didn't win the lottery... Hey Rach, so uh... how did your thing go?
What?! While she's been going through this hell, you've been making money?! You're betting on your friend staying in this misery?!
Ooooohh!
Yeah, not as much as you used to love to play uncooked batter eater.
My-my ring? My-my wedding ring? The-the stripper stole my wedding ring?! H-how?! How could this all happen?!
Pheebs, what about you?
Oh, please...
Oh, just planning my bachelor party with my best man.
Okay, Joey, you know what? You have to go for it. How often does this happen to you, huh? You owe it to yourself.
Hi! Sorry I'm late. Were you sleeping?
HEY, SHE'S FAST!! OKAY?!! Oh! You-you think you can be beat me? Let's go! Outside!!
Yes, yes I am. Are you a, uh, a friend of Rachel's?
It's my joke.
Was there...uh, huh, huh, huh... andybody, anybody else there.
Well, I'm sorry, but ah, look if you're not working with him anymore, why do you have to still do stuff with him?
Who-who wants fair? Y'know, I just want things back. Y'know, the way they were.
Okay, this is getting a little crazy. I mean, I'm-I'm sure it would be amazing but I...gotta say I really-really don't think it would be a good idea. Y'know? I really, really...don't.
I think on some level, you-you sabotaged your own audition so that Ben would get the part.
"... Sarah. I dig you", Uh? "Doctor Ross Geller".
Or! Or, we could go to the bank, close our accounts and cut them off at the source.
I don't see why not.
Yeah, yes it is, I was just moistening the tip.
Thanks for being born.
I got it.
Phoebe!
So you said yes to him, and you just had our baby?
Well, everyone's gotta kiss someone. You can't kiss Ross you got the history.
No! Okay! Okay! Okay, look, can I, can I just-just talk to you for a second?
Look Carol umm, I was, I was thinking maybe uh, maybe we can spice things up a little.
Are you serious?!
Oh, I'm sorry you've been Bamboozled! You're gonna be a terrible mother! I've lost sight of why we're doing this!
This is unbelievable. I - I have never been so insulted in my life. Now, if you'll wrap up my free crab cakes, I'll be on my way.
Okay, relax, relax. We are gonna be here for a while, it looks like, and we still have boyfriends and your career to cover.
That's correct! This is an audio question, what do you do when the baby makes this sound?
Uh actually, sorry I can't even make it. I'm seeing Mona again tonight.
Of course not, I'm... suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch.
You talked to her?
No, no you don't understand the animal hospital is way across town he's choking I don't know what else to do.
Your joke? Well, I think 'the Hef' would disagree, which is why he sent me a check for one hundred ah-dollars.
Hey!
Ah, he didn't uh, take it so well?
Woooo!!!
My baby sister, ladies and gentlemen.
Would you all relax? It's not that big a deal.
Wait, wait, You're mad at me about last night? I was just trying to do the right thing.
Yeah.
Look, you guys, you guys should go. No, I'm, you, you planned this all out, and I don't want to ruin it, so you guys should just go.
The head, the head. You gotta...
Wait a minute, look.
What the hell was that?!
Oh yeah, we're uh, yeah we're not together.
All right, show's over. Nothing to see here. Ok, let's do laundry.
Ok... now... now we're just holding hands!
Hi, did you order some bananas?
Easy.
Yeah well, if I know Mark, and I think I do, I'd expect nothing less.
Wo-wo-whoa. What about Phoebe's birthday?
I'm not getting you a muffin!
C'mon, you get the idea, ow-ow-ow we'll make our money back in no time!
Oh, you have some studying to do?
Look, I gotta go pick up Ben. Everything so far sounds great Joey, just remember to keep it on the mellow side, okay? Just a couple of guys hanging out playing poker, no-no strippers or anything okay?
Oh my God! That's Rachel naked! I can't look at that! I am looking at this. Okay, vivid colors, expressive brush strokes-Unless she wants me to be looking at that. She knows I'm home. She knows I can see her. What kind of game is she playing? I think maybe someone's lonely tonight. Oh-ho, Dr. Geller! Stop it! You're being silly! Or, am I?
Yeah, yeah. I got a lemon schmush.
Nope! Something else.
Marcel! What've you done to him?
God, you're amazing... I didn't even have to ask you to call me that.
Uhh, yeah. I mean, actually I kinda think that we'll have, we'll have two babies.
Hey, at least you have a wife! I-I keep getting divorces and knockin' people up! And I'm dressed as doody.
Aw come on, Mona Lisa?
Sure, what's up?
Well, okay, what-what did she say?
Well maybe, you know, maybe we should stay for one song.
Yeah, that's our baby.
I think just the annulment for today.
Y'know what...
Hey!
Oh my God!
A basket of mini-muffins.
Look, I-I drew a sketch about how we're gonna do it. Okay Rach, that's you. That's the couch.
Yeah! Let's go out.
Well I'm, I'm a little slow. Just as our children would be.
It's not that. Okay? Annulments are more complicated than I...
Rachel?
Those are the pacts!
Yeah, yeah, I was watching. Umm, hey, a couple of questions though. Umm, about that-that-that last move where the woman tripped you and then pinned you to the floor, what-what-what-what would you do next?
My apothecary table!!!
Hi, we have a little bathroom emergency.
You know what? This calls for a bottle of Israels finest.
It's right there!
You know what, if you wanna look for a house, that's okay.
Hey!
Okay, okay, okay.
Oh no, maybe it's me, I'm just not giving you enough credit. Uh, I mean it is difficult to say goodbye to five people. Uh, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, good... IT'S PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE. You know what? After all we've been through, I can't believe this is how you want to leave things between us. Have a, have a good time in Paris.
Yeah!
Hello! Can I get you anything? Huh? Lens cleaner? Your battery okay? Rachel!
Why don't we talk about this on the way to the hospital?
No.
Was I talking to her about gas?
No, that's all right.
Thank you, but, but you gotta leave.
Yeah?
Give me the bag.
Well remember that paper I had published last year on sediment flow rate, huh? They loved it.
You gotta hear this story.
Yeah.
So, how was the honeymoon?
Maybe I'll take her to that new French restaurant down the street...
Hey, there's uh, some people outside, askin' about candy.
Yes, but I've lived here for 25 minutes.
I dropped him off at Carol's. Anyway, it turns out that I'm not going to be able to get those tickets though.
No. You're just gonna have to accept the fact that you're just friends now, OK, you're not... rommmates anymore.
Hey! So ah, what did the insurance company say?
Oh, on a date. Yeah, I met this girl on the train going to a museum upstate.
No problem.
We?! We angered it?!
Yeah?
I'm sorry I'm late, did I miss anything?
That must be our alcohol and beers!
Really? You're not gonna return it?
I don't know, you don't wanna mess with corn nuts. They're craaazy.
Excuse me?
Hey, both you guys should be up there with me. I mean, you two are-are my... I mean, I'm lucky to have just one good...
I think I have an old band uniform from high school.
Hey!
Hey, y'know what? This is your fault! You're the one that didn't move his-his appointment.
No, I'm genuinely sorry the Mark thing didn't work out. Look, Rach, I want only good things for you.
What? What?!
OK. I'm in my apartment...
Yeah!
Well, unless you make some kind of big gesture.
Ah no. I don't, but it could not have been more than sixty.
And, I love you!!
I was thinking more like a hundred.
Here she is!
Good for you.
I don't know, but I ah, I have the feeling that my being there will do it. I'll go over and I will borrow something. Juice!! I need juice!!
Wow, Monica's letting other people help decorate her tree! Did someone get her drunk again or?
Oh thank you.
Of course, what happened?
People ask me why we're not together, I just don't know what to tell them.
Or you can sit with him on the front porch and make sure no one steals the trash cans. He does that every week too.
No. No, y'know you don't, you don't wear enough of this. What?
Yeah. Yeah, it really was. But we...we gotta be careful. We...we can't let that happen again, y'know?
Yeah, It's just... I don't think I can do this...
Is there somebody else?
Eh-wh-Excuse me?
You had a rough day, huh.. c'mere.
Oh man.
Hi.
Oh oh, we think Emma is about to start talking so we're trying to be careful about what words we use in front of her.
The lie you just told.
I know.
I just found out that Elizabeth's dad wants to meet me.
yeah I really, really need to talk to you about something.
For your information, it's a card sharp, not a card shark.
You know my birthday.
You got it.
What?! That-that's all the way cross town, I'm supposed to teach a graduate seminar there in ten minutes.
Don't yell at me okay, this is the most I've seen you all week.
Sorry.
Y'know I have dinner plans!!
Yeah, I ate all my gifts for everybody.
I wasn't talking to you.
Try sixty-five million years ago, and then try sssshhhhhh.... My tenure review board met today and I hear it's looking really good.
You don't know?! Rach, you balded my girlfriend!
Anyway, she thought the very idea of me playing rugby with him was like hilarious. So I'm gonna show her how tough I really am!
Hello.
What?
Yeah, sure, why not? In fact, if you know anyone that would be good for me...
C'mon, this was a pact! This was your pact!
Everybody!
No why?
No, it's ok! Made me feel like a rock star!
Oh no, she took down Monica... And I'm the crier in the family. Oh God! I could be next. Maybe she won't talk with me if it looks like we're deep in converstation. Oh, so that thing you said about the thing. It really made me think about that other thing.
How come it's always us left in the field holding the ball?
Hi. She said yes.
Boy, we uhm... hadn't really thought of that.
This is Rachel.
Joey, you owe $1100 at I Love Lucite.
You know, I hate to lecture you guys, but it's kinda disgraceful, that a group of well-educated adults and Joey can't name all the states. Did you ever see a map, or one of those round, colorful things called "a globe?" Hmm?
Um-hmm. I have a condition, apparently, that I require two different sets of focals.
No, no. The vet says unless he's in a place where he has regular access to some... monkey lovin,' he's just gonna get vicious. I've just gotta get him into a zoo.
Umm, no.
There we go. All better.
Uh, you weighted 200 pounds.
Hey you know what? You know what? To avoid this little thing in the future, let's just say, you and me, never having sex again.
Okay, y'know how you told me I should do whatever it takes to fix my marriage?
Oh, come on, every first time mother feels that way. You'll-you're gonna pick it up. Hey! You will! Uh look, y'know when you first came to the city? You were this spoiled helpless little girl who-who still used daddy's credit card. Do you remember?
Are you gay?
Yep, we got it, we got it. Thank you so much.
All right, it's cool you can stay here. My parents won't mind.
Yeah! Right!
Does it always, uh--?
Professor Neuman, the head of the department, so....
What's going on?
I'm an eight!
I-I uh, I got tricked into all those things!
Would it matter?
W-What was the one right before bananas?
Really? I mean, I, I had a whole speach prepared.
Hi!
What? Ow!
You made out with Missy Goldberg. How could you do that, after you promised me?
I guess so.
Hi there!
No, it's for when Carol goes into labor. She can get me wherever I am. I mean, all she has to do is to dial 55-JIMBO.
What?
That's right! That's right! Saran Wrap on the toilet seat so the pee goes everywhere!
Can I get some of that action?
I don't know Rachel, why?
Good luck!
Hey! I just got uh, my teacher evaluations! Check out what this one student wrote, "I loved Dr. Geller's class. Mind blowing lectures! Dr. Geller, you are definitely the hottie of the paleontology department!"
Okay. Well, you be careful.
Chandler was hitting on the hot delivery girl!
Well I told you it was Chandler who was smoking the pot but it was me. I'm sorry.
Great. Thanks!
Oh no, you-you don't understand. Ugh, this is so silly. Umm, this is all because of a sandwich.
Well, I don't know.
All right, there you go!
What? No! No! I am not gonna hide it from Phoebe-Ooh, although I did get some great Pottery Barn sheets!
Come on, two on one.
You are? Me, too!
Hey!
Yes. Yes. Just here and there .
What the? What...
Happy Thanksgiving!
What can I say, you missed your chance. From now on the only person who's going to enjoy these bad boys is me.
My best friend and my sister! I cannot believe this.
I'd bet I'd still be doing my kara-tay. Towards the end of our marriage I was doing a lot of kara-tay as a way of releasing the tension from y'know, not doing anything else physical.
Yeah, it was pretty traumatic. I was outside St. Marc's Comics... you know, I-I-I was just there minding my own business, you know, seeing what kinda trouble spiderman got into that week-
You don't-you don't want to hear about my dream Officer...Pretty?
No-no, we talked about it. We don't want to know. All we care about is that it's happy and healthy.
Okay. Okay, I'll talk to him.
Okay, the thing is..
Okay, look, he's not gonna hurt them, right?
What? No, that's illegal. I'm gonna have the labor department down her so fast they won't even...
Hey, you'll never guess what just happened... Phoebe and I got mugged!
Oh, hi! Hi! Thanks for showing you up thirty minutes late!
Ohio!! Thank you!
Ross.
Come on, I think this is a good thing. I don't think Mom would've hired you if she didn't think you were good at what you do.
Oh, veto. How about-Ooh, I like Ruth! What about Ruth?
It was a dry day.
I'm good, I have dinner plans .
So, um, what do you do for a living?
Yeah, I mean... I think when it's your shot, y'know, you-you know it's your shot. Did it... feel like your shot..?
...and it was Ernst Muhlbrat who first hypothesized that the Velociraptor would expand it's collar and emit a high pitched noise to frighten it's predator. Yes Mr. Lewis?
Hey! You wanna live to see your baby?!
Alright, alright, maybe it'll take my mind off it. Do you promise to buy me a big thumb finger?
Is there blood coming out of my ears?
Tonight.
How 'bout from now on we just call it the 'unfortunate incident'? Hey Gunther, you got stairs in your place?
I'm gonna tell Mom.
You okay?
She's doing her laundry.
Well hello! I'm Ross!
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Huh, I'm just saying...
Well, whatever it is I'm-I'm very, very sorry. Okay?
Mmm hmmm.
I was having a little chat with ah, Bonnie, and ah, guess what, she-she happened to bring up y'know, who was behind the um, whole head shaving idea, and now, who was it? Oh, that's right, that's right, it was you!
Ugh, easy for you to say, you already know what your kids names are going to be.
No.
Wow Monica! Hey, just so you know I had my uh, older brother chat with Chandler.
Mike "Gandolf" Ganderson, only like the funest guy in the world.
Yep! I'd like to thank you guys for coming down here to complain about the rain and ruin my career!
Nope, just the one. RACH!
Yeah, we want everyone to be there. As much as I hate to delay your doing weird sex stuff to my little sister.
What's up with the greed Joe?
Uh... Oh hey, do you, uh ...do you have any, um, Cinnamon Fruit Toasties?
One.
What?
Hey, thanks Rach.
No, 10 is the highest.
No-no. We...
Shhhh!
You keep, you keep... You can't...
Sorry I ah, I scared you in there.
Yeah?
No, no I don't want to do anything to you. All right? I just want to tell you that I'm not mad at you and...and that I certainly do not hate you. I just, I just came here to say that.
No, hey, I get that, okay, I get that big time. And I'm happy for ya, but I'm tired of having a relationship with your answering machine! Okay, I don't know what to do anymore.
Yeah.
Chandler, what kind of an idiot do you take me for?
Excuse me.
This was just a drunken mistake and I need to get it annulled.
Wow! We are pretty good at this! Hey! We totally forgot about lunch!
What? Why? What's wrong?
Five.
Listen, I gotta tell ya, I-I'm having a great time! Y'know how before you said it might be weird, the whole student teacher thing, and to be frank I thought it would be too, but it's not. I mean it's not at all.
I'm serious. I just don't trust that guy, okay?
Okay, I...
Two! I've been engaged twice!
Nope.
I want my turkey now!
Yeah. And did you, did you pack that bathing suit?
Okay, listen I am not a pervert!
All right, did you just say all right?
Hi!
Yeah! We'd meet, we'd meet total strangers, and hang out with them!
Hey you.
Yeah, but you're making me look bad!
I do have a newfound respect for life.
OH MY GOD!
I know.
That's okay, Joe.
Hey, you guys won't believe what I have to do for work today.
If you wanna call that a reason.
Look at that, they won't even turn their heads.
Monica. Whaddya think?
Oh, well this morning he got a call from who I think was our cousin Nathan, and frankly, it was a little more than I needed to know.
Just a second!
Yeah, listen...
Now I'm so happy.
Lo que sucedio es que no le gusta la tele!
Dude, you're not tanned.
Oh hey, Gary, want me to grab the berry for ya?
I know. A double blind date, and we both get stood up. What are the chances?
What?
Think he washed his hands?
Hey!
Enough with geography for the insane, okay? Let's play some ball, guys.
Sweetie, now I pick you.
Well what is it? Is it a mole?
It's been an hour and not one of my classmates has shown up! I tell you, when I actually die some people are gonna get seriously haunted!
So, what are you guys doing four weeks from today?
Why does everyone keep saying that?
You ever figure out what that thing's for?
Phoebe, there is no secret. Okay? I didn't propose.
Hey!
And that's bad because..., you hate chicken piccata?
Ooh, hey Ben, what if the Holiday Armadillo told you all about the Festival of Lights?
Yeah.
Ohh, it's Joey! I love Joey!
Okay.
Rach? Hi!
Should I leave this open for you too?
Fine, she can stay at my place. By the way, what-what does Cassie even look like now.
Yeah, it's the Ultimate Fighting Combo. Yeah, I saved thirty cents, plus I get to keep the cup. Yay!!
First of all, I'm not losing...
Oh God you're right.
Excuse me, is there a woman waiting at the bar? Someone average height, dark hair, perhaps doing a puzzle?
No, no, no, no, no, I don't want to know, absolutely not. I think, you know, I think you should know until you look down there, and say, oop, there it is! Or isn't...
I have shown you everything we have. Unless you want your mother to spend eternity in a lemon yellow pant-suit, go with the burgundy.
Look, I-I know how miserable you are, I wish there was something I can do. I mean I wish I were a seahorse. Because with seahorses it's the male, they carry the babies. And then also umm, I'd be far away in the sea.
Don't you realise none of this would've ever happened if I didn't think at that same moment you weren't having sex with Mark?
Listen. Um, listen. Something you should... know... um, Rachel and I... we're kind of a thing.
And that wasn't fun for you?
That's true, thanks dad. People should be dancing! Huh? Hey, this is a party! Come on! Joey, dance!!
Hey, say something to Emma on her 18th birthday!
Then what am I supposed to do?
What happened?
Come on! The time we were all waiting in line for Dances With Wolves and that one guy cut in line in front of us and I just lost it?! Screamed at him! Turned all red! Red Ross!!
You're welcome.
Whoa! Hey! Whoa-whoa-whoa, you saw her breast?!
Is uh, is Monica here?
Unbelievable, my classmates are gonna think I'm dead, my professors, my... my parents are gonna get phone calls. You're messing with people's feelings here.
Well, then who was on my bed?
'Cause otherwise they'd have to call it the room room.
Yeah. No. No you're right.
Uh Joey, can you give us just a minute?
Divorced men's club.
Shame on you! Ugly baby judges you!
Kinda... spooky without any lights.
Well, I don't know, it's-it's kinda in a place that's not... It's not visually accessible to me, and I was hoping maybe you guys could-could help me out.
Yeah, it does sound interesting, I mean, to listen to a woman complain for two hours, I don't think it gets bett...
Uh sweetie, maybe you'd be more comfortable here?
Uh, well, don't worry, I'll use the gentle cycle. Ok, um, basically you wanna use one machine for all your whites, a whole nother machine for colors, and a third for your uh, your uh, delicates, and that would be your bras and your under-panty things.
Aww, is it broken?
No-no, I got the edge. I know it's not exactly ethical but I sent him a little bribe to
That's what?!
Okay. Um, how about these?
Ya.
I'm sorry man. Here's a thought. This is the same ballroom. There's a band. There's gonna be plenty of dressed up people.
Wow, I haven't seen her for like forever. I wonder if she still carries that Barbie everywhere she goes.
Oh cool!
I think it's insane.
Okay.
Pretty cool, huh?
Y'know, it's interesting! Most people think that's made with seawater, when in fact-
Wha... what do you mean?
We know!
This is it. Unless we're on a break.
Actually umm...
One Mississipi, two Mississipi, Three Mis... WAIT! WAIT! I'm not-I've not finished counting!!
Ok, got the vent open.
yes, yes I did. and I will also say what I'm about to say Vis-a-vis the following Phoebe has never had a serious relationship since her. super-serious relationship with. Vicrum.
No, I mean tonight, in the building. Suddenly. Into our lives.
Oh.
I'll get it! I will get that!
Challenge excepted.
Yeah, I mean, if you moved there, you have to leave here. I mean, how can you leave this place?
Yes. Yes. Don't worry. Everything's fine. We'll uh, we'll see you tomorrow at the wedding.
Oh. Oh! Oh my God! Okay, I know this, give me-give me a second!
Nuh-uh.
Actually, it looks really good.
Yay!!
Oh!
Thank God.
Oh, just hold on a second. I'm watching this rugby thing on ESPN. I don't know what the big deal is. I'm man enough to play this sport.
Hello.
Oh, by the way, great service tonight.
What? Okay, okay, okay, okay.
Damn!
You're alone.
I know. My arm is killing me.
Well, Rachel's having drinks with him tonight.
No, no, she's great and it's not like we haven't done anything. I mean, uh, uh, we, we do plenty of other stuff, lot's of other stuff, like uhh. . .
No! No I can't. I mean Rachel's out with some guy. My baby went with her. If anything that picture keeps moving further away.
Uh...yeah sure.
I'm sorry. Ugh, Pheebs, you were, you were right about her. Y'know, she did try to use sex as a weapon! Yeah, I hurt my back a little.
No but...but still you can't possibly do this alone.
Look at me!
Okay, that's it. WE ARE SEEING OTHER PEOPLE!
Nothing. But the complaint department at the condom company got an earful. And then when I turned around she was gone.
Are you wearing two belts?
Oh Joey, Joey! But still, I mean, it seems like you guys are having a great time together.
Sweetie, calm down, it's gonna be okay.
Okay, come on! All right, I gotta go! So good luck at the party. Okay?
And so now you guys are gonna be married?
Ok, ok. I'm gonna come out to Long Island with you, I mean, you can't be alone right now.
No-no-no, I'm saying we-we buy more of this at the gift shop, throw our tuxes back on, and take a few pictures. All we have to do is make sure not to get anybody else's faces.
That's 'cause-'cause you're mom's dog kept-kept looking at me.
Hey, I thought I'd end up kissing Charlie too ok? But SURPRISE!
You know what? That is a very good idea. I'm gonna go make a pitcher of Margaritas.
Man! Did you see the kid on that nose?
Okay. You know that I-I have to go.
Oh, Rach...oh..."gleba" is not a word.
Seriously you guys, what's going on? What are these for?
Yeah, cheerie-o!
Hi.
So apparently I'm available for lunch.
I- I- I ca- I can't believe this. I mean, all I asked you to do was keep him in the apartment.
No, she likes that. Yeah. Faking sleep doesn't work either, I can't tell you how many mornings I woke up with her...
It was totally flirting. "Somebody got a haircut "
Correct! What is Chandler Bing's job?
What thing?
Uh, yeah! I still can't believe she hates Pottery Barn!
In the hospital.
What?
Hey.
Okay. Thanks you guys. Pheebs are you wearing fur?
Yeah. He wouldn't give me the grant, because I wouldn't give you up.
Julie. Julie. That. Oh God. Julie, right. OK, I need to lie down. No, ya know, I'm gonna stand. I'm gonna stand, I'm gonna walk, I'm walkin' and I am standing. OK so you uh, and now wha... and now, now, now you're over me?
Are you kidding?
Namaste.
No one, I'm just saying if...
Hey.
Oh, hey y'know, they-they really overcharge you for that stuff. But who cares?! Because it's all on me! That is, one big drink!
That's right!
No! No! Of course it didn't mean anything! I mean, uh well, I can understand why Emily would think it meant something, y'know, because-because it was you...
Shh. Do you want cran-apple or cran-grape?
...is for me not to see you anymore.
Yeah see? And you are so excited about moving in together before, and you know what? You should be. It's a big deal!
Thanks!
Okay, you don't have to stop, I'm invisible, I'm not here.
What? What? What? What is it?
Hey, here's a thought.
Yeah!
Hi.
Emily, hi! Uh, how-how was you flight?
No-no, it's not that, it's just... I-I just moved in.
Maybe you should look up "fascinating."
Oh my God, he just said your name, that's great! Good job Ben.
Bye.
Grab a spoon. Do you know how long it's been since I've grabbed a spoon? Do the words 'Billy, don't be a hero' mean anything to you?
Uh, you're not gonna win.
What?!
Yes, we did, everything's A-OK!
Oh hey, hey, huh, how about this weekend we have a laser disc marathon okay, and maybe a tournament on my new dart board? Huh, huh, what do you think? Two days of darts, it'll be great!
Well yeah!
All right, maybe it means that too...
Yeah!!
Naa.
Yeah. So um, I-I heard about this ah, Mark guy that ah, Rachel met today.
Oh.
Well I'm thinking that Chandler's our friend and Janice makes him happy, so I say we just all be adult about it and accept her.
Yeah, maybe not. So what you wanna do?
Oh. Oh, that's right. So-so you did see me that day because it seemed like you didn't.
Linen closet.
Maybe that will liven up this party.
Love you guys.
Oh yeah, about telling Mom and Dad, I was thinking about maybe writing a letter.
Y'know how-how the nurse said that-that Nana had passed? Well, she's not, quite..
Correct. Rachel claims this is her favorite movie...
Yeah. Listen, can you keep this information to yourself?
You look great. I, uh... I hate that.
We're not gonna do that.
Hey! Sorry I kept you waiting so long.
A date?! She's-she's got a date?! With who?
I'm-I'm Ross by the way.
Yeah.
Huh? So? We have a deal?
What?
God no!
Hey!
No, no. She's way to emotional. And by emotional I mean crazy.
Okay I-I just have to stop by my place first.
What? What's wrong?
Well, if I'm still here in an hour, buy him a drink on me.
What?! The guys against the girls? See, that's ridiculous Monica, because I'm only down by three touchdowns.
Ohh, this cake is really good!
Yeah?
Hey!
Mma, Mma, Mmaah
I bet if I talk to Carol and Susan I can convince them to move to London with Ben.
Well, I guess I can check out those apartment listings, even though there's never anything in here.
Oh really? Well I-I guess Monica should know about Atlantic City.
Yeah.
What? Oh! I gotta tell you, I-I wasn't expecting to like her at all, I mean I actually wasn't expecting to like anyone right now, but she's really terrific.
I can't believe in four weeks they're gonna be married!
Wait-wait. I, I got it. I was there.
Uh, uh... Sure! Uhm... "Dear..."
Oh, I don't know, they seem to have a shared interest in each other's tonsils...
And hey, here's to a lousy Christmas.
Oh my God! I love this apartment! Isn't it perfect?! I can't believe I never realized how great it is!
Okay, so what's the matter?
Hey!
No, Susans gonna be there too. Weve got dads, weve got lesbians, the whole parenting team.
Oh my God.
Turn.
Yeah, just a little in high school, but then I really got into it in college. I mean that's-that's when I really found my sound.
That's not true!
Looking up?
Ask them if it would be faster if we cut the baby's face off the penis, so we can put it on the bunny. . That is a weird sentence!
Well, that's what I'm here for. Want me to get that?
Oh...my...God! I-I see what this is! You are in love with Rachel!
Same difference.
Joey, Homo Sapiens are people.
Oh that's nice.
Yeah that's what she said.
There was one! She's it! All the rest look like they should live under a bridge!
No Rach! Come on! No-no! Yeah, I'm sure we won't get arrested for this.
I think it means he freaked out and left!
Well, then, I think, I think the guy is scum. I hate him. I mean I actuallyI-I physically hate him. I always have. You are way too good to be with a guy like that.
Oh, and she's pregnant with my baby. I always forget that part. Helloo!
Oh, guys, this is fun, isn't it? You know? Just the four of us. Just hangin'.
My Thanksgiving leftover sandwich. I can't believe someone ate it!
Oh my God, you guys!!
I've got to say you guys, that's an incredible gesture!
I always knew I was havin a baby, I just never realised the baby was having me.
There's other stuff too.
Sure! Here.
Yeah.
Wow, Rhonda.
Hey, does anybody want to get some lunch? All those in favor say I?
Can't hold her own head up, but yeah jumped.
What's she look like?
Mmm-Hmm.
No! No! I want to talk now! Okay? I-In fact, I am going to talk to the president of the condom company!
Well, it's not for sure but umm, we met this guy in the park who thought Ben was really cute--y'know, which he is--so umm anyhoo, he uh, he gave us his card and told us to bring him down for this commercial he's auditioning.
Yeah, but we-we have to be at the Four Seasons for drinks in 15 minutes and then y'know, then The Plaza for dinner.
Yeah.
Hey, here's a theme: Come on in, live like bacon.
Hi!
Hold on a second, alright? Just think about what you went through the last time you quit.
Well uh...
Okay, guys.
What?! No! No! Wait! You're right, this is stupid. Who cares what people think? I mean, I mean we like each other right? There's nothing wrong with that. Come on. Burt? Lydia? Mel? This is Elizabeth.
Look...
Look, don't worry about me. Okay? I'll just stay real energetic and stay away from the ball. I'll uh, I'll be that guy right out of the circle.
Yeah I'll press 1!
Yes! Ben learned a little trick.
That's great! So you're staying in New York!
Well yes, yes I have. In fact umm, just the other day Kristen and I were talking about how I've been married and how I have a son.
Good.
Uh fellas,
...Yeah?
No, no, I mean, I mean a thing on my body.
I talked to Rachel's sisters, neither of them can come.
Well, it was loong. I didn't even realise how late it was, until I noticed the 5 o'clock shadow on her head. Anyway, she didn't want to stay. I called a cab; she just left.
Hey, where's Rach?
It was my first time.
Marcel. Bring me the rice, c'mon. Bring me the rice, c'mon. Good boy. Good boy. C'mere, gimme the rice. Thank you, good boy. Well, I see he's finally mastered the difference between 'bring me the' and 'pee in the'. 'Bring me the' and- Rach?
Glad I could help man.
Look, I was nervous! You guys had me all worried I was going to be boring! I got up there and they were all like staring at me. I opened my mouth and this British accent just came out.
I'm here. How's my little boy? Want Daddy to change your diaper? So, did you have fun with Uncle Joey and Uncle Chandler today?
No no, you're fine, you're fine.
Okay! Okay! That's it!! Parents!! Parents!! Back away!! All right, this is our wedding day! From now on everyone gets along, and if I hear one more word. NO GRANDCHILDREN! That's right!!
Susan is Carols, Carols, Carols, friend...
Tell me about it.
Yeah, we kissed, but... nothing else... nothing else happened, okay.
Ahh, what's a little mid-life crisis between friends?
Now, do you have any idea what you just said?
No! No! I...didn't do that. It's just... Okay, honestly no. I don't, I don't see a big future with her.
I can't believe they-they didn't even tell us!
I have an oily T-zone!
Hey!
I dunno, it's weird. I mean, I know she's gone, but I just don't feel, uh...
Because it's soft... Hey, so how was your date?
Hey, when-when was it kicking? What happened?
You're livin' the dream.
No, no, no, no! Don't tell me! I don't want to know!
Elizabeth! Okay. Okay. I'm gonna go out this window. I'll meet you at the front door. Just tell them you're going home, okay?
What?! Chandler she's our cousin!
Yeah? Wow! It looks really violent!
Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine.
I'll make some calls.
Yeah?
What?!
Yeah! Good for you Joe!
Oooohhh, I'll bet she's one of those people.
Ok, cut! Great. That was... that was just... yeah!
Hey, how can it not be me?!HeyHey!
Two? Wha...? Don't tell me you dated Benjamin Hobart.
Monica? Monica, Monica, Monica, Monica..?
Every week, the TV Guide comes to Chandler and Joey's apartment. What name appears on the address label?
Yeah!
Hey look, Phoebe. I, uh, I laid out the states geographically...
Na-huh.
Wha-What?
We can still catch that Ukrainian film.
Well, there is an Arby's in the shape of a tee-pee.
Well, we-we said we'd just do it that one time but, but now I think she may wanna start things up again.
O is for "oh, wow!" The V is for this very surprising turn of events, which I'm still fine with by the way. E is for how extremely normal I find it. That you two are together. And now one day you might get married and have children of your own.
It really was!
Okay, Pheebs: Right hand blue. Good.
This room! This night! That waiter! His shoes! I must take a mental picture! Ooh sorry...
Doctor Burke is sexy?
You do?
It didn't.
I can't believe they gave you a ticket. You're such a good driver.
Sorry.
Well then a small one!! Listen, let's, we kinda have to get going!
Well, that's cool. So did...
There's no seatbelt!
He finally asked you out?
I'm just so happy you guys are finally getting a kid.
Sweetie, it's be gonna okay, all right. It's a wedding, generally people focus on the bride.
In this life, Phoebe.
Oh good, you scared me for a minute.
No tongue.
Oh dude, don't worry about it, I found an unattended maid's car. We're way ahead of the game. Ross: Oh my god.
Eh, you got a spray-on tan?
You've been quiet all morning. Is everything okay?
Oh but I-I-I haven't paid you yet!
Department of Sanitation?
What's going on?
Great!
Sure.
No, I tried that. She says it has a weird smell.
I can't believe Rachel just moved on and didn't say anything to me.
And while that was good advice, you should know that what-what she wants...
You guys know where Rachel is?
You're moving?
Seriously?
Yeah. Right. Save it. I can do that.
What do you mean "no"? I knew you'd be my death, Phoebe Buffay.
Got it!
JFK.
Seriously that's a lot of cups.
No more falafel for you!
Yeah.
I am not doing this over the phone.
Yeah, a real pleasure.
Oh... Ohh... I'd love to but I really have to grade these papers.
This year was supposed to be great! But, it's only the second day and I'm a loser with stupid leather pants that don't even fit!
How about you?
Is everything ok?
OH MY GOD!! I didn't really believe it until you just said it!!
No you didn't. You said you would, but you never did!
Ok, use it in a sentence.
No I don't want to play video games, Joey!
That that's ridiculous! I don't feel guilty for her failures!
Okay, I think I got it.
Wow! Kind of uh, kind of a full house here. I'll guess just...I'll come back.
Okay, good-good for you.
Mmm-Hmm.
Okay! Okay! Okay! It's okay. It's okay. Hey, it's too weird for you, I won't see her again.
I dont know whether hes testing me, or just acting out, but my monkey is out of control. But, he keeps erasing the messages on my machine, "supposedly" by accident.
Oh come on, we just had this huge fight, all right, don't I have to wait a while?
Well, I kinda half to. I mean, because the thing is...
Dude, I wanted him to guess.
Rach, Rach, we'll be fine, all right? You go have fun.
My wife's a lesbian.
Not at the concert.
Okay, I'll see you soon buddy. Be back in an hour.
Thanks, man, big help.
Yes.
Goodnight sweetheart! I love you. And remember, you're daddy's little girl... Phoebe's totally ruined that for me...
Good.
Yeah, she's got to go back to London. But you know what? I've been prepared for this from the start. We both knew we had two weeks together, and that's it. Y'know.
Ohh.
Well, of course you can defend yourself from an attack you know is coming, that's not enough. Look, I studying kara-tay for a long time, and there's a concept you should really be familiar with. It's what the Japanese call unagi.
Fine, two tickets, I need two tickets.
What you got over there? Tacos?
Hey, I'm more cop than you two!
The gas is odorless, but they add the smell so you know when there's a leak.
I could ask her to live with me!
You had fantasies about Emily?
Phoebe? Phoebe?
Hi.
All right! All right! It was the best nap ever!
What? What?
Yeah, none of us have to deal with pressure at our jobs.
You know what? I know Chandler longer, so I always think of him as my best friend, but now... I may have to rethink some stuff...
I know, it's the first time, we're leaving the baby and ... hey, I know how hard it is for you, but ... but Emma is gonna be fine. My mom is gonna be with her. She's great with kids.
Okay. So, um, Phoebe tells me you, ah, you play piano.
It's-it's hot...
Joey!
Hey, y'know if you want to pick up some extra cash? Some friends of mine made good money doing telemarketing.
I don't know.
Hey, there.
But if I hadn't walked in here, would you..?
Where exactly is your zoo?
No, you, ya know there's no need to make it u. . . how?
We'll each tell you how we came up with the joke and then you decide which one of us is telling the truth-me.
Thank you.
Is it? Feels like two.
Uh, lunch chef, purchasing, own little desk when Roland's not there. Here's to my little sister--
Okay! Okay! Okay. I'm sorry. Please, please, you were in Western Europe and?
About what?
No. No. No, I'm-I'm glad you did. Look, if nothing else, it's-it's always great when someone tells you they love you.
Yeah, I was going for the metaphor.
Please start drinking!
So, I'll umm...
I don't know what to do. What am I gonna do? I mean, this, this is like a complete nightmare.
Hi!
Oh fine.
Just you keep it, listen did you, did you tell anyone about us?
Wait! Wait! Wait! Y'know what? Just stay. Please? It uh... It would really mean a lot to me if you stayed.
Oh yeah, it's a good idea!
Wait a minute, you guys. Oh, I wanna ask you something. I-I I may get to speak at this paleontology convention and if I do, I'd love for you guys to come and hear me.
Really?
Yeah that's the same.
Uh-uh-Wow! Uh, I thought you guys were just like making jokes, I had no idea. What you know what? You guys are wrong. Uh yes, there is a chronological age difference but I never notice it. You know why? Because she is very mature. Besides, it doesn't really matter to me what you guys think. I mean, I'm the one dating Elizabeth, not you!
Well, I guess we could tape Entertainment Tonight.
Split it?
Go!
Even if the sidecar had a windscreen so your hair wouldn't get messed up?
Yeah, no problem.
I don't know. It's just not the same without Mom in the kitchen.
Flip me for it? No, no, no... heads, heads, heads!
Yes, professor Feesen-sen-stenlger... I'll be with you in one moment. So, I will take one box of the Thin Mints.
Rach! Rach!
yes, yeah I said something stupid about her never having had a serious relationship, but you should know she is so much fun, a wonderful person please don't blow her off.
So that's the only reason she could be here huh? It couldn't have anything to do with the fact that-that maybe I'm a good listener and I uh I put on a great slide show!
MY SANDWICH!!!!!!
And you didn't marry him because...?
What kind of problem?
No-o-o! No way!
Look, would you guys grow up? That is the most natural beautiful thing in the world.
He's right, man.
Okay, I think we're getting into a weird area here...
That's cool.
I can do that. Oh-oh, what if she gets upset?
So? Sure! But it-it wouldn't be anything romantic. And I'm-I'm dating Mona-Damnit Mona! I was supposed to meet her like an hour ago! What is wrong with me?!
Shhh! We're not talking.
Oh, thank you. Hey, hey. Rachel!!!!
I do too! I do too!
Ok, um, uh, more clothes in the dryer? I'm fine, I'm fine.
Hello.
Yeah, right.
Good-good-good.
Four letters: "Circle or hoop".
Look, even if I were gonna tell her, I don't have to do it now. Okay? I'll be seeing her again. We've got time.
Four.
Ok. Here's his diaper bag, and his uh, Mr. Winky, and uh...oh, him. Hi!
well then I didn't need to bother you or the four other Mike Hanagens I bothered.
And! Break!!
Ah, I'm sorry.
Lady, he is people. He has a name, okay? He watches Jeopardy! He he touches himself when nobody's watching. Please, please have a heart!
Yeah!!!
I'll help you. Yeah, I'll make up a schedule and make sure you stick to it. And plus, it'll give me something to do.
Well, I tell you what. Why don't we uh, why don't we just stay here? Let's not see a movie, we'll just hang.
Y'know, y'know I'm lookin' and I don't think anyone's home here. I say we just break the window, crawl through, and-and y'know explain later.
Look, were down to just one point. Could we please, maybe just settle it after the wedding.
Look. Look, I wasn't going to say anything to you, but... All right, I don't think you should be seeing Tommy anymore.
Oh God. Y'know, botanists are such geeks.
Green. To the green.
Yeah, I think she looks good.
Uhm, well... I'm here to see if you'll give Rachel her job back.
Look, I... Look, I'm having a great time with you and I just don't want us to move to fast or put to much pressure on us. So, I'm sorry I just don't think we should go away together yet. It's-it's too soon.
Y'know what? I can easily get out of this, but there is a chance you can get very, very hurt!
I'm trying.
And that is why we cannot see each other anymore.
Now that is funny. Hey, do you think...would it be too weird if I invited Carol over to join us? 'Cause she's, she's alone now, and pregnant, and, and sad.
Bunny!
Joey! This is like the last commercial. You've got like ten minutes left!
Dad?
Come on, Rachel, come on! Talk to me! Please!!
Did you know Chandler kissed Rachel?
Oh, what were the other two?
How great is this? You are already comfortable enough to look through my stuff. Oh, I am sorry Michelle, that'smy roommate, Rachel.
10 seconds, you need this or you lose the game.
What was Monica's nickname when she was a field hockey goalie?
Okay! Fine! Fine! If-if this is what you think, forget about the whole three divorce thing! Okay, I-I'll go to my lawyer's office right now and get this marriage annulled! Okay?! Because she means nothing to me! Noth--Nothing!!
The first date we've had in months, and they were both such disasters.
Don't say that.
It really was.
Oh, you're right, I'm sorry.
No, no, let me finish.
You're right, you're right, it is...So you gonna invite us all to the big opening?
And it can't be Joey.
Well, that's because you're such a sweet, gentle, uh...Do you, uh, do you...Oh, hey, uh you must need detergent.
Don't toy with me.
It's not the best!
Hey! Uh, I thought, I thought you were at table six.
I don't know, I don't get, I don't get it, I mean, wh, wh, two months ago Rachel and I were like, this close. Right now, what, I'm takin messages from guys she, she meets at the movies? I mean this, this Casey should be takin' down my messages, ya know, or, or, Rachel and I should be together and, and we should get some kind of me, message service.
They make you take an oath?
Uh-huh, I see that.
Eww! No!! Her ear! All right, Monica categorizes her towels. How many categories are there?
Well, why don't you correct him?
Wait a minute! No! I'm the nice one! I'm the one who danced with the kids all night! How...How small are your feet?!
It's my joke.
Okay, you go grab it!
You uh, you may have been right about Jill.
Pheebs, what, is it the age thing?
Oh-oh yeah, you-you came up to me and asked if I could do you a favor, and my Uncle Murray came up to you and handed you a check. And then you said, "Why do they call it a check? Why not a Yugoslavian?" Yeah, then you did that.
Phoebe!
It'll be okay Joe.
This is crazy! I mean, yes-yes Rachel is my good friend and I-I have loved her in the past, but now, she is just my wife! Phoebe, will you-will you help me out here?
Nooo!
Here's an idea. You walk into a room...take a quick scan!
Rachel says sharing's great and supposedly, you know, we outta be doing it. Do you wanna?
But we haven't seen each other since then. Well I land in China, guess who's in charge of the dig.
That's right, I love you! And-and I'm gonna play with you all the time.
No, Rachel got pulled over for speeding. She forgot her licence so now I have to bring it to her.
You're good. These are not.
Hello.
Where's Ben?
Alright, let's go!
Ahh. Ooh, is this a ah, is this a bad time?
So you're just like a... guy who's a nanny?
Yeah.
College?
I'm sorry the answer there would be...none of us.
Oh my God.
I was really upset about Rachel and Paolo, and I think I had too much tequila, and Nora- um, Mrs. Mom- your Bing- was just being nice, y'know, and- But nothing happened, nothing- Ask Joey, Joey, uh, came in-
Um . . . ah . . . you know, I'm divorced. Um, Phoebe, ah . . . Phoebe said you . . . You've been divorced?
No look I wasn''t right, that's what I came here to tell you. I was totally hung up on, on my own stuff. Listen, I'm someone who needs the whole security thing, ya know. To know exactly where my next paycheck is coming from buy you, you don't need that and that's amazing to me. I could never do what you do Joey.
Marcel?
What kind of job is that for a man? A nanny? I-It's like if a woman wanted to be...
You uh, you don't believe in gravity?
Yeah.
Well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title?
Yeah, you really sidestepped that land mine.
Show me where?
Why are you laughing?
Yep, and you know what other holiday is coming up?
Uhh, those are tacos.
Besides, I-I think I figured out a much faster route, I'm sure I can make it this time. I just...I just can't be afraid to get a little bit...hit by cars.
Yeah? Yeah, where is it?
Are you kidding? Okay, look. I-I studied evolution. Remember, evolution? Monkey into man? Plus, I'm a doctor, and I had a monkey. I'm Doctor Monkey!
Oh yeah, no no no...that's great!
I am this close to tugging on my testicles again.
Y'know, okay. You're right. It is huge. So why don't we take it just a little bit at a time? Okay? Umm, forget getting married for a sec; just forget about it. Can you just come home and take a shower?
Well...
Wait, how do you zoom out? There she is.
Yes. I find it to be something of a conversation piece.
Hey!
Yep.
Y'know what? I-I-I... I-I have had enough of this! Y'know, I-I-I care a great deal about your daughter and I have treated her with nothing but respect! So if-if you've got a problem with me, frankly...
That guy Lipson?
That's ok. Uh, anyway, well he and I both really liked you a lot, uhm, but we didn't want anything to jeopardize our friendship, so we kinda made a pact, that neither of us could ask you out!
Yes!
I know.
Okay, go left. Left! Left!
Marc- oh, this is ridiculous! We've been all over the neighbourhood. He's gone, he's-he's just gone.
Nothing I do means anything, really.
Huh... huh... what a loser! Some more wine?
Well, pretty incredible according to the message she left you on my machine. Hey, Chandler, why is this woman leaving a message for you on my machine?
...can't, can't a guy send a barbershop quartet to his girlfriend's office anymorrrrre!!
...now remember you have to imagine me in a kilt.
It was ok...
I would say that.
Oh-oh really? Did you confuse it with your own turkey sandwich with a Moist Maker?
You know what I don't care. The only person I cared about getting dressed, is the one person that says she's not even gonna go. Look Rach, I'm sorry. Okay. Look, I-I wa, I was a jerk. I'm sorry I yelled. I want you there, I need you there. Look, what, what can I do that can show you how much, how much I want you to be there.
Juice, I need...
...But a man can change.
What's wrong?
Honey. Honey, have you seen my Harmon Kilerbrew bat? Bob doesn't believe I have one.
O-okay, Rach calm-calm down, okay? She-she's really upset we're just talking.
All right.
Y'know, hey! You're the one who ended it, remember?
I know what you mean, I've always wondered how different my life would be if-if I'd never gotten divorced.
Hi.
Uh, yeah, you sure you want to after what happened at their 20th?
Well, I don't know.... huh-huh.... but I'm hoping huh-huh.
I'm sorry.
Th-th-that's all it is, a third nipple. Y'know? Just your run-of-the-mill third nipple. Y'know? You can take it off. Just slice that baby right off!
Uh, I actually haven't even met him.
Right, will you excuse us for one moment? What are you doing?
What? So what are you going to do? I mean how, how are you going to tell Chandler?
What?!
This screen is amazing, I mean Dick Van Dyke is practically life-size.
How come? Everybody else does.
Yeah, yeah. You should come check us out. We're called "Way! No Way!".
Yeah, see Mon, listen, listen. When Carol and I broke up, I went through the same thing. And you know what I did?
Well, you know, I'd feel a whole lot better if you got dressed now.
Yeah.
Uh, no... no. I couldn't find him. I'm just gonna talk to him on the plane.
We think Chandler might be having an affair.
My best friend and my sister! I cannot believe this. You guys probably wanna get some hugs in too, huh? Big news!
Oh my God!
Guess who's up for keynote speaker at the National Paleontology Conference?
Check this out. Five hundred and seventeen boxes!
Hey! So, how was Atlantic City?
Shielding your face and shrieking like a girl... is not a backhand.
But you already told me everything.
So, you gettin' tired?
Well, he said there's definitely nothing to worry about, it's totally benign.
Yeah, most of it it's a place packed with confused angry baseball fans!
Okay, are you mad at me because my hair gel smells?
Hhhiiii.
Ow, ow, OK. Alright, alright, Mon, Mon, you've gone ultrasonic again, alright.
Good luck.
Oh! Wow! Uh, yeah! That sounds great. I'm just gonna put this back in my pocket, pretend that didn't happen. Uh yeah, actually I'm free now. Do you wanna grab some coffee or...
Oh my God!
No touch! No touch!
Look, I am a reasonable man. I will accept store credit.
Catch any big fish?
Im gonna be a father.
Ok, Mom never hit.
If it does? Then you're an amazing friend of mine.
I can't get *enough* dinosaurs!
Cousin Frannie's wedding, its tomorrow night.
You know, Barracuda was the first song I learned to play on the keyboard.
Rachel, this is your apartment.
Hi. Mom. Dad.
Oo-oo!
FOR THE LOVE OF GOD TAKE IT OFF!!
Gunther! Gunther. Gunther, please tell me you didn't say anything to Rachel about me and the girl from the Xerox place.
How are we gonna decide who gets this?
Please, he refers to me as 'wethead'.
Yeah!! Yeah!
Y'know I remember when uh, when I was in college, we used to...
How does this look?
Well that's fine with me. Could use the money.
Why? What-what else could it be?
Hi.
Thank you, Dr. Phillips, but I'm having my lunch at this table, here in the middle. I'm having lunch right here, with my good friend Joey, if he'll sit with me.
Hey! How long until Pete's fight?
Yeah, I was but uh, she was a little busy with a water balloon fight.
Oh! No-n-
That is a great idea! And! I know Ugly Naked Guy because we've been watching him for like five years so that gives me back my edge! Oh, let's see now he had the trampoline.
Well I guess you can start by drivin a cab on Another World.
Well I am that. And that whole rage thing is definitely behind me.
Oh, thank you, thanks. So uh, how was your night last night?
Ohhhh
Wait a minute, does-does everyone feel this way?
My God! These pants are burning up! Oh come on, she wants to snuggle now! What is she trying to kill me? It's like a volcano in here! Are you hot?
You're crazy.
I'm sorry. It's just that this is the worse Thanksgiving ever.
Veto.
Hey, you guys! Guess what?
Well, we're all here! I guess we should get going!
Oh, I've got to go pick up Ben, we've got a play date this afternoon.
I can't believe this, I thought we were all in this together!
You had a rough day, uh?
All right, bad ankle, got it!
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm really sorry. Sorry. Sorry! Hey! Hey! I got my s's back! Which we can celebrate later. Celebrate.
Yeah, well...nah.
Look, this is hard enough! I really need you guys right now.
No, a car backfired, but I thought somebody was taking a shot at me. And Rach, I...I survived! And I was filled with this-this great respect for life. Y'know? I-I want to experience every moment. I want to seize every opportunity. I-I am seeing everything so-so clearly now.
All right, I'll see you tonight.
Oh My God, she-she made half a English Trifle, and half a...Sheperd's Pie!
Now, if you wanna try to make some of it back, I'd be glad to play you for it. But I should warn you, I am very good at Cups.
Oh, we have to get you an engagement present?
Okay. You uh, you wanna hear something weird?
It's in Barbados.
Come on, they're gonna love you.
Ohh! That would be great.
Yeah?
Close. Ron.
No! For all I know, she's trying to find me but couldn't because I kept moving around. No, from now on, I'm staying in one place. Right here.
It's worth the pain. Y'know what, you know what? It's not.
Do not rush me!!
What, we-uh- we don't have shoes here, or...?
You got ink on your lip.
Just a sandwich. Turkey, a little mustard...
Y'know what? She'd-she'd love this. Uh, it's an exact replica of Apollo 8. I made it in the sixth grade.
But wait, there's more. Hey, Chandler, what is in the envelope?
I went thru this with Ben and Carol. One cup of coffee won't affect your milk.
What about Emma? We don't have a nanny.
I uh can't believe I'm gonna say this, but I think Susan's right.
There's an image.
Animal sex, animal sex? So what're you saying, I mean, you're saying that like, there's nothing between us animal at all. I mean there's not even like, uhm, a little animal, not even, not even like, like chipmunk sex?
Oh! Well then this is awkward. So what do you uh...
Oh. Can I... can I ask who?
Hey!
It's breast milk.
Oh hi! Ross Geller. And this is my friend Phoebe.
Yeah, it's-it's tough being single. That's why I'm so glad I found Amanda.
Wrong! Now you're single. It's actually secret option number three, you meet her at the gate. That way she knows you love her.
Nothing! There's nothing to do! I mean, she lives there, I live here. I mean, she-she'd have to uh, move here. She should move here!
Oh, but it's a kind game! So we're a little late, you know, the girls will be there, let's stay just for one more goal.
No. When he called, I...I threw the message away.
Where is she?
Is that what they say on the Figure Skating Team?
It's still a gift! I got it from the gift shop!
Look both, Joey and Monica feel the same way that I do. No-no-no-no.
Wow.
They, uh, were infected. He wouldn't have made it.
Wow! This is so amazing. I uh, I really thought I'd have to talk you into this more.
And sexy.
What? Oh my God! She-she thinks we're engaged! Why? Why? Why would she think we're engaged?!
Hey! That was a practical purchase! I needed that car for transportation! Okay? I-I have a child!
I'm never gonna find love again.
That's funny...Do you think you'll ever work again?
It's also a sign of friendship.
I don't know, probably just invest it.
It was you, pal.
Hm-mmm.
Will, high school was-was a long time ago.
I don't want to be single, okay? I just... I just- I just wanna be married again!
Right. Good night.
Yeah.
So, uh, how's she doing?
All right, that's it! Come-you-no! You are in big trouble young man!
Look at you two, bonding, making us late for the airport so...
Pretty soon I guess.
I don't even wanna hear it, you're just...
Look. Look, my mom gave me that ring because she wanted me to propose to Rachel, but all I wanted to do is if she maybe...kinda...wanted ah...start...things up again.
No!!
Four hundred, huh? Well, that sounds do-able. How much are the boxes?
I love you too! I'm, I'm gonna call you right now from the phone booth! You can't hear me.
No-no, I-I have to see if this apartment became available.
Oh what are you kidding? She's gorgeous, it's all Rachel.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
So we're a little late.
Really. It's always been you, Rach.
You've really crossed the line here, but that's okay, it's ok 'cause I'm on my way to buy some Photoshop software and a stack of gay porn. That's right! Your coming out is about to get real graphic.
Par-tay!
Hi.
It's your turn.
Well, so, you-you'll get a job here! I mean, I'm always hearing about uh, them foreigners coming in here and stealing American jobs; that could be you!
Oh. Oh. Thank God, most women don't even feel them.
What? Where?
It's the only possibility, Phoebe.
I'm sorry you lost your money, but I won it fair and square.
Okay. You can feel all the bones in your skull.
No I-I-I would love to be around for you and the baby. And we-we can just try it like on a temporary basis.
Hey. So I uh, I didn't get that apartment. Some problem with my application.
That is an old, Chinese woman!
Your make-up!
What's going on?
Kind of inappropriate, don't you think?
Ok. Let's see. Oh, you should take her to the MET!
No, I mean, look I don't know if anything is going to happen with us, again. Ever. But I don't want to know that it-it never could. So I stopped it and she got mad and broke my projector.
Yes. Yes. Yes! Yes, I really do! In fact, it's funny, very often, someone who you wouldn't think could-could curl your toes, might just be the one who...
No, no. I mean, it mighta been at first, but by now I, I think I'm pretty comfortable with the whole situation.
Is-isn't it the best?
We got honourable mention in the brother/sister dance category! Look, it's almost fake midnight, do we really have any other choice?
I know! It's like, if you knew, why didn't you tell me, you know? I mean, call, or leave a note: "Hi, I just dropped by to say your wife's gay"
All right, here's the ring.
Oh, sure! I'm sure.
Oh OK. Well then why don't you, uhh, why don't you borrow it from mom and dad? You feel guilty and tense around them already. You might as well make some money off of them.
'Why don't you call him?!' Well, thank you very much! Y'know now he is going to prep her, y'know prep her, as in what you do when you surgically remove the boyfriend!
Hey!
You're welcome, Ben. Merry Christmas, ooh, and Happy Hanukkah!
Uh Joey, that's just the minumum amount due, that's your total due.
200 at least.
Neither will I.
No Phoebe, don't look! You don't want to see what's under there!!
Uh-huh.
Really?
Oh ah, I think you know where I want to go.
Ok, ok, here is to my sister, the newly-appointed head lunch chef--
Let me see! Show them!
Oh, Pheebs, I'm sorry, Ive got to go. Ive got Lamaze class.
Rach!
Ouchy.
No! No, I won't! I'll be at the bottom of the dating barrel now. The only guys below me will be Four Divorce Guy uh, Murderer Guy, and-and, Geologists.
I am good. Okay! Okay! Uh, I got the pillow! I got the bag! You got the keys?
Yeah, I'm sure.
There was never a good time.
She brought them up! I didn't realize you were coming back so soon!
Yeah?
No. No-no uh, he just, he just really freaked me out before.
But, okay.
And as my wife I think you should grant me this favor.
No, no I don't, because it's being restrung, somebody was supposed to bring me one.
I don't want to be single, okay? I just... I just- I just wanna be married again!
Yeah... Oh, great. More party boys for Chandler!
How's it going?
Okay, I'll be up in, 18 pages. Front and back. Very exciting.
He is my girlfriend's father, okay? It's-it's, it's weird!
No, I fold.
What is that?
Oh... ok, fine. But... ehm... I just have one question for you, ehm... When we exit should we walk, or run, or prance, or stroll...
I just...I have to find out how it went.
Okay, okay, so we're in the car. Right? And bang! A shot was fired. And Joey with no regard for his own safety throws himself on me!
Wha-, you have a phone in here?
Hmm?
Ah....
Yeah.
I'm Ross Geller. Wha, I'm, God in your add you said you were pretty but wow.
Hi Whitney.
Peach pit. That night we, uh- we had-
No, no, Carol. There's nothing wrong with it. I just, I just don't think breast milk is for adults.
Dude. Well done. You know what? If I die, and Rachel dies and Monica dies then you can totally take care of Emma.
What are you talking about? You get sixty responses just for coming out of the closet! I didn't get one response! And I'm dead!
The chocolates aren't here yet.
Tag? Y-You're going? Uh we didn't, uh we didn't get the chance to talk. Uh, so, where did you say you're from again?
Awww.
Why, why, why can't you stand me being here? I don't, I, we're just, ya know, we're just havin' fun.
Hey, hey buddy, Marcel. Marcel. In the jungle, the mighty jungle the lion sleeps tonight. In the jungle, the mighty jungle the lion sleeps tonight. a-weema-way, a-weema-way.....
His daughter was hot.
And that's what's gonna kill me. I'm allergic to kiwi.
Umm, jealous!
Come on. I got it.
No!
I have no idea. I mean... But-but I assure you I will figure it out.
Um, I do not want her baby-sitting our child.
Hey, what you do on your own time...
Then don't. Stay here. Just don't go so soon to London, just one more day.
Finally, factoring the profusion of new species recently discovered: Gigantosaurus, Argentinasaurus...
What?!
Yes I am.
And you had no idea they weren't getting along?
This was Carol's favorite beer. She always drank it out of the can, I should have known.
I don't want to do that.
Huh.
Here, go nuts.
Ohh, okay.
The point is I... I don't need this right now, OK. It, it's too late, I'm with somebody else, I'm happy. This ship has sailed.
There's my boy! Here's my boy! And here's his Barbi What's ah, what's my boy doing with a Barbi?
I know, why not?
Oh, yumm!
This is fun. Hey Rach, remember that whole "We were on a break thing?" Well, I'm sorry, will you marry me?
Hey. Oh, I'm sorry, this is Cailin.
It's just a fur ball.
And um...You look nice today.
Yeah... I guess. I don'tI don't know. Alright, just... just give her this for me, OK?
Ok well, I would like to do a dig in the painted desert.
Uh-huh, that's why they call it Staten Island.
Just, y'know out.
Umm, no.
Are you kidding?!
Who is Maria?
I've gotta go, there's a deer just outside eating fruit from the orchard!
Well I uh, I skipped forth grade.
What?! What?!
Oh! Y'know, I've got an extra futon.
I heard it. I heard it.
Okay, gimme my monkey back.
C'mon! This looks good!
Hey!
I wanted this to work so much. I mean I'm still in there, changing his diapers, pickin' his fleas... but he's just phoning it in. Just so hard to accept the fact that something you love so much doesn't love you back.
No I don't, to hell with her, she left me!
Ohh! Okay! Okay. "There are three primary theories concerning sediment flow rate. Each of these theories can be further subcategorized into..."
My marriage is over.
Look at it this way: you dumped her. Right? I mean, this woman was unbelievably sexy, and beautiful, intelligent, unattainable... Tell me why you did this again?
Well, she wore it all Christmas day, and then uh...
Well, I'm going to take off. Congratulations man.
He is so weird.
Look, I uh, I tried not to kiss her, okay?
The guy you gave your number to.
Well yeah-yeah the Scottish history is so much more...
Y'know what? I think we've seen enough, let's turn it off.
Well, I was just playing with him, and y'know we were doing the alphabet song, which he used to be really good at, but suddenly he's leaving out 'e' and 'f.' It's like they just ah, I don't know, fell out of his head.
C'mon, just tell me, please, please.
Ben Franklin.
Yeah I know; he's in Ben's class.
Well obviously only one of us can keep dating her.
Hey Pheebs, what are you doing?
Am I?!
Female body inspector? What size is that?
I'm not a nice guy.
The test is ready.
I can't believe you put that on my alumni page!
Yeah.
I uhm... Well, I sang... well actually I rapped... Baby Got Back...
All right.
Much better.
Hi.
I'm sorry your husband cheated on you.
Ok.
A-A day.
Umm, Jo's a girl, it's short for Josephine.
Phoebe, I told her you already knew.
Even if we want it really bad.
Really?
Rach, come on, look, I know how you must feel.
Well, if he's angry, he really shouldn't just cover it up. I-I wish he would just tell me the truth.
I know.
Phoebe he's right, that is the rule.
Ok, well, if you do take him out for his walk, you might wanna bring his hat, and there's extra milk in the fridge, and there's extra diapers in the bag.
That's all right, Rach, we got the bags. Hi, hello. Julie, this is my sister Monica. This is Chandler. Phoebe. Joey, what up?
What?
Yeah.
Yes there will. Oh guess what, Molly Gilbert you've just been bumped up to table one. And if it's all right with you I'm gonna take your place at table six-Martin Clickclocken.
What about the guy from the bar?
No.
No. no.
Anyway.. um.. So, you- uh- you nervous about Barry tomorrow?
Yes, I suppose I am a dog. But Issac, see I-I happen to have a girlfriend.
You were the 200-pound 11-year-old who rode her!
Hey!
Hi.
Evidently they do.
Wow, it really is!
Marcel, Marcel, give Rossie the remote. Marcel. Marcel, you give Rossie the remote right now... Marce... you give Rossie the remote...
What are you doing? We're going to a hospital.
THE HELL I DO!
Oh, Monica, I figured I'd come by tomorrow morning and pick up Fluffy's old cat toy, OK?
The only thing I understand is; postponing it is not an option. This is when we're getting married.
Don't listen to your mother. You're independent, and you always have been! Even when you were a kid... and you were chubby, and you had no friends, you were just fine! And you would read alone in your room, and your puzzles...
Ah, no Mon, Dad had to buy everyone of your boxes because you ate them all. But ah, y'know I'm sure that's not gonna happen this time, why don't I put you down for three of the mint treasures and just a couple of the Rudolph's.
All right, we'll start off slow. The only thing you have to do tonight is come up with the name of your main character.
Man! They cannot get enough!
Cheers!
Oh. How do you uh, ya know, keep it so neat?
I just wanna thank you for being there for me today. And I'm sorry I,I almost broke your hand.
Did Rachel tell you we hired a male nanny?
Six months Rachel, six months.
Uh. Would you guys mind giving us a minute?
Okay, okay, I'm sorry, it will never happen... Uh-oh! Wait a minute! Wait-wait, now there are a hundred of you and I'm the king.
Jasmine?
Mr. Morse I need to talk to you about your mid-term exam, I'm afraid I-I had to fail you.
Monica and I have a grandmother who died, you both went to her funeral, name that grandmother!
Okay, Joey, you know what? You have to go for it. How often does this happen to you, huh? You owe it to yourself.
Okay, if you'll excuse me, I-I'm gonna go hang out with some people who don't know the Space Mountain story.
Okay. Wow! This is going so well. Did you see us? Did you see?
Not broad backed!
Ohh!
So, do you get colours or just French tips?
Yes, and that's why we're here.
No! No!! No! Can I speak to someone in charge please?!
Come on, I'm your older brother, ask me!
Please don't take her away from me!
What?!
You want me to take some girl I've never met to the opera so you can go to a club and flirt with some guy, hmm, that-that is a toughie.
Ohh, I-I see lotion, I have lotion! Will that work?
That's right good things, that-that is what I said.
Just ignore them.
You couldn't let me have her, could ya?!
Hey, what's this?!
Whew! That was a brisk ride!
You are way off, pal.
Well, I was thinking of taking Emma to the playground!
What?!
Ooh, I wanna switch to Rachel too!
Why are we in bed together?
Yeah.
Oh, you like it? You wanna know where I got it?
I saw you!
You know what, I think we've had all the bad luck we're going to have.
I, I don't know, it's got all this stuff about wind and trees and there's some kind of sacred pool in it. I mean, I don't really get it but she's, she's pretty upset about it.
Question. Why do we always have to have parties where you poach things?
DANGER!!! DANGER!!!!!
Hi Julie.
Okay.
What?
Man... I... I'm sorry.
Ok. I'll see ya later. Just think about it, ok.
Hi.
No.
What, Rach?
No, not you.
Wow! What a pleasure.
Hey, I hear she's single again, d'you think I should ask her out?
I'm sorry, it's just one of my last nights together before she leaves for camp-to be a counselor!
Uh-huh.
That's the day you're gonna die? See-darnit, I've got shuffleboard that day.
What? No! Of course, of course I do! Are-are they gone?
Rach, I got a message from you. Who's Michael?
Well, ??? think that's us?
Ohhh.
Oh...
Sure!
We are having a baby together, but we're not involved. I mean, uh we-we were seeing each other a while ago, but then we were just friends. And then there was one drunken night. Or, yes stranger, we'd like this delivered please.
The doctor says it's completely normal with all the hormones. Plus, you-you're sleep deprived.
Thank you. C'mon, Marcel, whaddya say you and I do a little mingling? Alright, I'll, uh... catch up with you later.
I've no idea, could be. Listen, I'm sorry I had to work tonight.
Oh yeah? What are you gonna do?
Hello!
Well, now I do!!
Hello? Hi.
I don't know what to say, I'm sorry. Though, you're not supposed to take these. It's like a million years old, we, we actually, we had people looking for that.
Show them to me!
I want to go to the bathroom.
Ah, that's okay, thanks.
Hey! Hey Adrienne.
Ahhhh!!
I have to break up with Charlie?
No! I made it seem like I was just calling to chat. Pretty sure, they both think I'm interested in them.
30 seconds on the clock. 5 questions wins the game. The lightning round begins...now! What is Joey's favorite food?
Oh no, I have plans with Elizabeth.
What? Whoa, whoa whoa whoa, what do you mean, back to Jordie? We never landed on Jordie. We just passed by it during the whole Jessy, Cody, Dylan fiasco.
What?!
Well, what about me?! I'm a medical marvel!!
Well, the stuff I just mentioned.
I go back there with lawn ornaments, he's going to laugh in my face.
No, no, that's funny. But maybe it's time to move on, let it go, y'know? Stop it! Besides, Rachel is going out with Elizabeth's father, so ah, he's much older than she is. Looks like I'm not the only one interested in fossils, huh?
Yeah. Hey, remember the time I jammed that pencil into your hand?
Dad, we-we can't believe you're selling the house.
Oh I-, Oh wait, Tony can you hang on? That's the other line. Hello. Oh yeah she's here but uh, can she call you back? OK thanks. Call Joanna. Hi.
Just three?! I'm dilated three!
I know. I feel horrible. Okay.
Well, we should probably get going.
oh no yeah, no Phoebe is great, but umm I'm an idiot look right before you guys went out I accidentally got her all upset.
Yeah, that way I figure, ya know, we'll be far enough away from our parents that we don't have to see them all the time but close enough that they can come over and babysit whenever we want. And yes, I know, the taxes are a little higher than, let's say, Nassau county but the school system's supposedly great.
Thank you!
Well, it turns out that she is going to Daytona for spring break woo-hoo. That means, that means wet T-shirt contests, guys doing shots off of girl's bodies, waking up next to people you don't even know...
Atta boy.
Here!
Hi.
Oh no! That-that'll just bring me down! This was great! I mean I-I-I was great! This is a great day! Y'know what? I'm buying everyone coffee. All right? If someone would just grab my wallet, it's in my pocket.
Yeah, ooh yeah, I think there is one from batch 17 left, uh... It's batch 16! 16 people! Get out of the way!
Well, not really. I mean technically it's-it's not against the rules or anything, but it is frowned upon. Especially by that professor we ran into last night, Judgey von Holierthanthou.
I get it! Well, that's that.
You're wrong.
I would never do that!
I would, but I bruise like a peach. Besides, y...you know, everything is gonna be fine. The baby's sleeping.
So, this must be kinda neat for ya, huh? I mean, your Dad tells me that you get a couple of days off school, and you, you ah, don't have to sell those cookies anymore.
Ok, ok, now what is wrong with my Snuggles? What, it says I'm a sensitive, warm kinda guy, you know, like a warm, fuzzy bear. Ok, I can pick something else up on the way.
Nobody likes change.
You did it, man.
Oh, yeah, no problems. It's all taken care of.
Remember? You-you were eating pizza.
I... I do, I do not love Rachel. I'm gonna tell her right now about the whole thing so we can get this marriage annulled as fast as possible. Okay? Would I do that if I loved her?
Yes, of course they like you!
Wh... wh...what?
Who gets whom. I don't know why I do that.
Hi.
Hey!
Yeah, well.
Um... uh.... vulva.
Well, I was with Carol for like eight years and I lost her. And now if it's possible I think I love you even more. So, it's hard for me to believe that I'm not gonna, well that someone else is not going to take you away.
No, I-I got really hot in my leather pants so I took them off but they must have shrunk from the-the sweat or-or-or my legs expanded from the heat. Look, I-I can't put them back on. I can't!
Yeah!
I don't know. A month?
None.
What happened?
Oh, but-but it is, uh, it's just like the first Thanksgiving, when the Indians and the Pilgrims uh, sat down to dinner.
It's been sixteen years but the air quotes still hurt.
Oh yeah it's fine. I guess the more muscles you have the more they can spasim out of control.
Well uh, I-I'm a paleontologist. Umm, I-I live in New York. I have a son Ben. Uh, hi Ben! And uh...
Okay, come on! Daddy needs a new pair of electromagnetic microscopes for the Prehistoric Forensics Department! Okay. Take Pinky Tuscadero up to Inspiration Point, collect three cool points!! Yeah! Which gives me five, and let's see who is gonna lose their clothes. Ummmm, I think I pick our strip poker sponsor Mr. Joey Tribianni.
What?! What do you mean? You-you-you're not pregnant?
Oh-ooh!
What?
What is ah, Rach in her room?
Why-why can't you take a couple of days off?
Rach!
Maybe this would've happened if I'd been more nurturing, or I'd paid more attention, or I... had a uterus. I can't believe this!
Oh well, it sounds to me like your family is ready to uh, rediscover its Scottish roots.
Yeah I am! Yeah, Ben got a second audition!
That's okay, I'm cool over here. I'll catch up with you later, Joey.
Hi! It's me.
Ross, wants a pajmena?
You know what, you guys, we don't have to watch this.
Ezels!!
Yeah... what am I going to say to Kenneth Schwartz?
I have sex with dinosaurs??
Tell me about it. So what, what's your magic number?
When I got married you slept with my sister.
Right? And this! She-she could've won this!
Then how did you get caught in the barbed wire?
Woah. Woah... Woah.
I am, uh, I am...
Ah? Well, he and I would probably have a lot to talk about.
That is what the thing is.
No anchovies.
Ok, and then you take the poopie diaper and you put it in the poopie diaper pail.
Yeah.
Rach, y'know I can see you naked any time I want.
Good morning. Hey pal, look who I brought. It's your old friend Harry Elefante.
Because... the night you kissed Rachel was the night I kissed Rachel for the very first time.
Thank you.
We're rehearsing a Greek play.
Hello, it's us, all right? It'll be fine.
Yeah! I opened up to her about all the terrible stuff that's been happening to me. I mean I talked for hours. It is amazing to have someone give you such-such focused attention.
Y'know actually it does have a very interesting history. Uh, this street is the first street in the city to have an underground sewer system. Before that sewage and waste would just flow right down the street. Yeah, sometimes ankle deep!
Press the button.
So were you in Nam?
Okay. Well, apparently Chandler's angry at us for not getting him a ticket to that Knicks game a couple of weeks ago.
Uh.... bean! Bean!
Em-Emily? Em-Emily? Emily!
No!
You called Animal Control?
Okay.
Guess who's a finalist for a huge research grant! I'll give you a hint, he's looking right at you.
My foot is stuck in the pocket.
Oh, shhh, shh. Magic is about to happen.
And confused. Rach, sweetie, I-I um...I didn't propose to you.
Burt!
Ok, well, uh, I can maybe grab a sleeping bag, or... Oh, oh. . No, Rach! I'm sorry, I just don't think this, this, this is a good idea.
Great. Great.
Really? I've been thinking, this is crazy, I mean don't, don't you think we can work on this?
And yet somehow it's true!
I made fun of his accent.
Yeah, why would it be weird? Hey, Joey, can I get some coffee?
Look, Mon, do you want us to uh, come back later?
Please, you're going down!
What?
Yeah.
Just, just, just pick one!
Hey Chandler! Saw the new furniture. Very nice.
No see now, now I can't because uh, I'm feeling too self conscious.
Same difference.
Hey! I just spoke to your dad, and you know what? He seems to think we'll be able to find a new place for the wedding.
I am, yes.
Yes. Yes, yes I did. But-but it was, it was just a one night thing. It meant nothing.
Oh, who cares?
I can't believe he didn't come!
Well ah, actually...
That's, that's Julie. Ju... Julie, Julie. Hi Julie.
Cigarettes?!!
Hey does anyone have any gum?
Are you kidding?
It's a great class.
Fine, I'm mentally unstable.
Y'know I don't understand why they didn't cry. It was a beautiful speech.
Sorry.
That was different!
I love you.
No, hey-hey, come on, Ben, Santa is not mad at you, okay? Hey, you're-you're his favorite little guy!
No! No! Wh... What are you doing?!! GET OFF MY SISTER!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Thanks. I know you guys like to give me a hard time and all, but it really means a lot to me that you like her. Just knowing that you guys are...
Who?
Okay. Sure.
Joey!
Joey, I figured you'd understand. I mean, I-I've known him a lot longer.
No, no, no, I'm sure you have a great excuse, wh-was it a hair appointment, a mani-pedi or was there a sale at Barney's?
Well hello! She's cute! Should we uh, go try to talk to her?
It isn't ridiculous, look around! No one's here!
I Ross...
Yeah! Yeah! OK! Sure! Look! Can we...can we talk about what happened here last night?
Okay, that's it, I can't take it anymore.
Emily?!
Hey, what's wrong?
Oh! Oh! She's upside down but she's coming! She's coming!
It was ridiculous. Ya know, these guys, they were bullies, actual bullies, ya know. We're grown ups, this kinda stuff isn't supposed to happen anymore.
Oh my God, you've got a crush on your sister's stalker.
Wait! Whoa-whoa, you...you gave her the ring?
Hey!
Nope, nope, that's it.
No.
Actually, it wasn't that close.
He looks so tiny.
High collar and baggy pants say I'm a pro.
Okay.
No, no, no... why, because it might get weird for everyone else? Who cares about them. This is about us. Look, I-I've been in love with you since, like, the ninth grade.
Hey-hey, or I could bring my keyboard over here sometime!
Listen, Joey, I know what he did was wrong but don't you think you could at least hear the guy out?
I mean, I don't feel like I even have a girlfriend anymore.
Well, uh, for your information, there's a woman at the museum, who's curator of moths and other... uh... winged things... who's, uh, let it be known that she is drawn to me much like a... well, you know. But so far I've been keeping her at bay, but, uh, if this is the deal...
Well, as much as I'd like to meet Josh and warn him, Emily and I aren't going to be here. All right? I mean, she's going to come by first to say good-bye, and then I've got a whole special evening planned. So I'm sorry, no party.
If you wanna put a label on it.
No. No-no. No. What would you do next?
The Geller Cup.
Okay.
Hey there you go!
I am like Indiana Jones.
No!
So uh, Emily called last night...
Okay. So uh, well, this-this is uh, this is awkward.
Alright. The, uh, the neighbours must be vacuuming. Well, so long as we're here and, uh, not on the subject, I was thinking about, uh, how mad we got at each other before, and, um, I was thinking maybe it was partially because of how we, um...
Come on, you-you can't tell me you actually believe that-that there's a woman inside that cat!
All right.
Okay look, do-do, you have anything Christmassy? I promised my son, and I really don't want to disappoint him, um, come on, I...uh, you gotta have something.
Right. So is it gonna be like 'I'm abandoning you while your upset.'
Oh I'm, I'm making this too hard. Okay, what do you want me to do.
I mean, you just went out with my best friend, and I just think it'd be a really really bad idea. Or-or not!
Why? Did you write it?
Thank you!
Nooo, but it, but it's great.
No, I-I-I'm serious, okay? I mean, think about it. You move in, you start fighting over stupid game rooms, next thing y'know you break up!
Don't blame the questions!
Ohh, I don't think so.
Wait a minute, the house was built on radioactive waste, and an ancient Indian burial ground? That would never happen.
Oh you do, do you?
Good for you.
Hey Pheebs, what 'cha reading? Pheebs? Hello? Phoebe? Phoe-Phoebe! Come on!
Well we...we don't have a garage.
Hi.
I never gave it to you.
Sure what kind?
Uh, okay, yeah, we could do that, but before we head off to the murder capital of the North-East, I was, uh, kinda wanting to run something by you. Y'know how we were, uh, y'know, talking before about, uh, relationships and stuff? Well-
Queen Victoria.
But it absolutely didn't. It didn't!! It didn't!!
You go get 'em. What did I do to you? Did I hurt you in some way?
Yeah.
You got me.
Not even if Carol's breast had a picture of a missing child on it.
Kristen, hi. Are you uh, new to the area, 'cause if you are...I'd love to show you around sometime.
What am I supposed to do? He's out cold! In fact he was just talking in his sleep before and evidently he wants someone named Fran to spank him harder.
Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs!
Wait a minute, is it because Joey and I didn't invite him to that Knicks game a couple of weeks ago?
Oh, eh, just thinking about Emily getting married tomorrow.
You're over me?
Hey.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I got to get to the museum. So um, I'll see you tonight.
Yeah.
Huh.
Oh! like what?! Oh I'm sorry, I don't mean to pry... it's just that this must be what regular people experience when they watch "Access Hollywood".
Listen, I know you wanted to talk to me, but I have an idea that may make you want to stay married. We register, and you get to keep all the presents!
Y'know, the kind of fun, you and Susan had when we were married.
Not touching myself if that makes anyone less uncomfortable.
You ate my sandwich?
It's possible, they have really sharp edges.
So I told Carl, 'Nobody, no matter how famous their parents are, nobody is allowed to climb on the dinosaur.' But of course this went in one ear and out.....
Well that stinks. I was looking forward to us wearing our celebrity tuxes together.
Oh great!
Uh...Mona just dumped me.
2:17.
And that's funny, why?
Joey, you are gonna love this guy. Gandolf is like the party wizard!
Hey! I offered to marry her!
Well let there-what if a man comes along and puts a gun to your head and says, "You ride this bike or I'll sh...I'll shoot you."
What?! Look, we're trying to rebuild a relationship here, right. How am I supposed to do that here, without being totally honest with each other?
Yeah, take your time.
I don't know what I'm going to do. That date starts in like an hour.
He's unconscious, I think we'll be just fine!
Hey guys!
Well, I mean it's not all bad. I'm learning to appreciate the uh, smaller things in life. Like the sound of a bird and the color of the sky.
Rachel, I can see you dialing! I don't understand why...
Will you make the mashed potatoes with the lumps?
I don't know. I mean I have plenty of opportunity. Just just now there were some women at the coffee house smiled at me.And then the other day on the subway a woman "accidentally" sat on my hand.
Look, I do not re-love her.
Smaller than that.
Uh, huh. Yeah, right after I thank everyone for giving money to the museum, I sing a song about the wonder that is Joey.
I like it. I do, I think it's a Ten.
Basically he told me to get over myself and just do it, ya know. So I though about what you said and I though about what he said and, well, his way I get to have sex tonight so. . .
...And I read about these women trying to have it all, and I thank God 'Our Little Harmonica' doesn't seem to have that problem.
Rach? You wanna come?
Okay. Uh, huh. Excuse me, I'm sorry, I-I think you may be in our seats.
Hey, wanna...wanna a little cheering up?
Sometimes I wonder if I did the right thing, ya know, giving him away.
No, that's, no, as long as you're okay. So I'll ah, I'll see you tomorrow.
Hey!
It's the museum again, can I, oh.
Okay, okay... How exactly is a two month old supposed to appreciate puppets?
Come here, here, come here, come here, Mrs. Buffay. Sorry, about what I said, umm, it was, it was insensitive of me to say that you were just a cat. When clearly you are also the reincarnated spirit, of my friend's mother.
Who the hell is Jordie?
Oh-oh, wait, my mother is gonna be here any minute. And she has the keys.
Her name is Celia. She's not a bug lady. She's curator of insects at the museum.
Huh!
One more fight!
Well I-I-I, that kind of thing requires some serious thought. First, I'll divide my perspective canidates into catergories....
Phoebe.
Oh good, you haven't left yet.
May 12th?
Joey, please.
What?!
Uh, what?
Yeah? How'd it go?
We said it was only going to be two weeks, y'know?
Grazie.
Ah, we're out. I sold them all.
Ah, somebody's at the door on the ceiling.
And you know I wanted to ask Charlie out since the day I met her.
I don't know! I guess I just can't believe any of this is happening.
Yeah, well, Hurricane Gloria didn't break the porch swing, Monica did!
So really, what'd ya have?
No, it's really not that bad. I mean, I-I for one, feel perfectly safe.
What a great idea! That will get Rachel to forgive me!
Hey.
Thanks again, Dr. Green.
Great! I'm across the street having sex with her right now. Your story sucks!
All right. All right, I'll do it.
Huh?
Uhm no! Think less of you! No, I don't think less of you. I mean, you saw someone you liked and you kissed them. I mean, those people who like someone and don't kiss them... those-those people are stupid, I hate those people.
I know.
Open up. We want to talk to you.
What?
Oh no, yeah no, that part's great!
Not just a key, I gave her the only key! I am now a homeless person in a very serious relationship.
I can't believe Chandler is missing this!
Oh my God..
No. I think you misunderstood what I was saying. What I meant was...
Phoebe, are you, are you mad at me, or something? 'Cause if are please, tell me what it is I did!
What? Rach! Come on, that's terrible! They're...uh...they're babies. They're-they're all beautiful.
Hey, would you ah, would you like some juice?
but you, your so much better off you just go from guy to guy having fun and never worrying that it terns into anything serious.
Buddy, my monkey?
Wh-wh-what line? The line that prompted a student in my last class of the day to say uh, "Dude, don't you ever was your face?"
Wow, couples who live together do start to look alike. So, Mondler...uh, what uh, what 'cha doin?
That's the hope! So, is Emma awake yet?
Hey. Uh, Chan, can I uh, can I talk to you for a second?
Do you have a minute? I'd like to talk to you about something I'm, I'm really uncomfortable talking about.
Are you all right?
I'm feeling better.
I don't think so.
You tell them to wait!
Who?
Sid you lucky deaf bastard.
Focus.
Of course I was mad! I told you I-I hate this stuff! Okay? It-it's not funny!
Okay, it's not, it's not.
Guess who?
Chandler, have you ever put on a black cocktail dress and asked me up to your hotel room?
Oh hi! Hello! Uh, have you come to ask me some more paleontology related questions? Uhm... your grandmother's nickname, perhaps? Aunt Margaret's pants size?
All right here. Watch me execute the three 'P's of championship play. Power. Precision. and penache.
Thanks, I put a lot of extra thoughts on your gift.
Oh come on! Here we go! Stand by for mission countdown!
Oh, it was good! It was good. Actually, the baby started kicking!
Congratu!! -lations-lations.
Well, c'mon. Don't ya want to find out?
No, hi, I'm, I'm an honorary Brown Bird
Ok. Well, before I say anything, I just need to know, is this one of those things where you break up with a guy, and then I tell you what I think, and then the next day you get back together with the guy, and I look like a complete idiot?
Yeah-uh!
Hey, they're going to the gym together! Two women! Stretching! Y'know they-they take a steam together! Things get a little playful-didn't you see Personal Best?
Neither will I.
You didn't tell her?! Okay, fine! Pheebs?
Bec-Did you not hear me?! She's an assistant professor in the Linguistics department, okay? They're wild! Why do you want to come anyway?
Oh my God, Phoebe, slow down!
You too! What are the odds?
Oh yeah!
No thank you for... Thank you.
Oh...
Rach, I'm so sorry.
Yeah, save it for the cab, okay.
Look, I'm sure it would be great, but I-I think one of us has to be thinking clearly, so, I'm gonna go!
It's a blanket Joe, not a cloak of invisibility!
Oh my God!
Ahh.
One more time, "Hey, don't you want a washboard stomach and rock hard pecs?"
I can't believe you'd rather go out with him than me.
Yeah well, he's not gonna get this one. Ben is way cuter than that kid. I mean look at him, look at you,
Hey!
Ohh, I gotta go to the flower store! Check it out, no one will tell me where Emily is, so I'm gonna send 72 long-stem, red roses to Emily's parent's house, one for each day that I've known and loved her. That oughta get her talking to me again.
