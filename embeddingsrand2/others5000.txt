Melinda!
Can I please see your face?
Well, if you don't, I will.
And we kinda figured about the porch swing.
Oh thank you.
I gather by that oh that he told you about me.
Yeah.
I don't speak English.
Wha, you know, maybe we can do something else!
Uh, public display of affection coming up. You can avert your eyes.
That's it? That's the giant number you were afraid to tell me?
You two were married?!
Night Mon. Night Julio.
Sure!
Are you sure?
Yeah.
Hi honey.
Okay!
So I'll see you at the party? Beer's beer man, 24, 7!!
I don't know, they're just a little blah!
Ahh, are you hadsome.
I'm sorry it didn't work out between you and me, or you and me. Drew was very disappointed.
Yes!
Alright, it's true. I behaved horribly. But it's only because I still love you. And I would do anything to have you back in my life.
Okay uh, we have narrowed it down to Raymond, Ben, Kyle, and Joey. The rest of you, thank you very much.
Let's go!!
I... I don't know if that changes your plans at all, but I thought you should know.
Well yeah! ...Oh God. I- just- I thought- Good, Shelley. I'm just gonna go flush myself down the toilet now... Okay, goodbye...
Good luck, with your girlfriend.
You found that handle, did ya?
It's out there man! I've seen it! I got it!!
Pass!
What?
Are they still looking for us?
Can I help you?
Oh umm, actually I umm...
Yeah.
Now, y'see, most people, when their pets pass on, they want 'em sorta laid out like they're sleeping. But occasionally you get your person who wants them in a pose. Like, chasing their tail, or, uh, jumping to catch a frisbee.
Very much.
Hey!
Mom, dad, thanks for dinner.
Sorry.
Great. That would be fine.
Well, what do you want me to say?
OK, I'll just sit here and... uh... chat with your, uh.... friend-type....people.
Hello, Rachel.
We're, we're just gonna get a little sip of water.
Umm, slight change of plans. We've shut down.
Yes and you talked to her...
Can-can we take a look at your ticket?
What's the matter with you? Get out of here!
What?
Ohhhh. Relax, take it easy buddy. Tell me twice, you want me to go? Alright, alright, guess I'll be back for my stuff. But if you think for one second I'm leaving you alone with my fish, you're insane Jack!
Ooh, actually I've been making a list of all the women I know who might be into doing this!
So thanks for the warm welcome. It's good to have you guys on my team, and I come to play. I hope you do too. Now, let's go out there and get 'em! Huh? And remember, there is no 'I' in team.
I'll tell you what, Chandler, why don't you call me when you grow up!
I don't know. I think maybe one of them is dying. I kinda hope it's the girl. The guy is really cute!
I mean, we know it's a bit hasty but, uh, it just feels so right, so...
Hi! Hi sweetheart! This is my husband Sid, I don't think you've met him. Ross, Rachel, this is Sid. I nabbed him a year ago at the dermatologist's office. Thank God for adult acne huh?
Well yeah, I'm sorry. I know this is the wrong time and the wrong place but I had to tell ya! I wanna spend my life with you. I wanna marry you. I wanna have kids with you.
And tell him what?
They musta read the sonogram wrong. 'Cause they, 'cause they thought it was a boy, but Chandler's a girl! Chandler's a girl!
Yeah. That didn't work out.
Oh, good. Thisll be fun.
Start pushing. Here we go. Here come the shoulders...
You never told me about that guy on your sweet sixteen. Oh, ugh. I'm sorry about that.
Yeah! Welcome, it is Soap Opera week here on Pyramid, let's meet our contestants. First, Gene Lester is a database specialist, he's gonna be playing with "Days of Our Life's" star Joey Tribbiani!
Chandler! Come on, I'm gonna show how to roll up your underwear and stuff it in your shoes. It's a real space saver.
It was dreadful. I felt terrible about how I acted when you said those wonderful things.
He is? Why?
Sweetheart, we love you just as much as Ross! Now, I'm sorry about everything that happened and I'd probably never be able to make it up to you, but here's a start.
Chandler, one of us has got to be strong.
Why not?!
But you're not.
Yes?
Hello everybody!
Hey-whoa-hey-hey, what was that?
Hi!
Well, okay, so what's now-go get, go get the eggs, put 'em in there.
Well, it turns out that Erica didn't pay much attention in Sex Ed class, because the thing she did with that prison guy... it'd be pretty hard to make a baby that way.
She took all my stuff.
no, no, then I would get the baby. I mean you know it would be just like a movie. Like at first I wouldn't know what to do with her, then I would rise to the occasion and and then I would get a makeover and then I'd get married.
Okay, we're not.
Hey Joey!
You're a grand ol' flag, you're a high-flying flag, and forever in peace may you wave....
Humm, really?
Sweethart, but none of that matters if it's too soon for you. It's fine! We don't have to move in together. I just-I want you to be happy
Ohh, well. Y'know we were always together, in fact the had a nickname for the three of us.
Can I get you anything?
Oh no. I thought you said they could shoot the spot without you.
He's just jealous. You'll fit right in; all Londoners wear them!
Wow! Wow, thanks a lot! I just wanna say, I think you're really talented.
Oh, well, is it what we thought it would be?
I don't know.
Is it ok if I hug you now?
Yay!!
Oh! Something smells good over at Monica's station! Oh my God! This is absolutely amazing! You've never made this before?
Hi, I'm Maria.
I don't have any great ideas. I am eight.
Yeah, I filled them out last night?
What-what are you doing?
Oh, you kids Well, this is the best party I've been to in years.
Do you have the, the Ralph Lauren file?
This is the housekeeper speaking. And by the way, young lady, that is not how one addresses a person on the telephone. First one identifies oneself and then asks for the person with whom one wishes to speak.
I-I was wondering, my niece you see is in from London-well Shropshire really but y'know-well she's about your age I say. Anyway I have tickets for the opera, Die Fledermaus, and I was wondering if you'd like to keep her company this evening?
But, he told me over the phone.
Rachel?!!
Is this Emmett?
98 hot saves, highest in the force.
I'll come back for her later.
Oh, but the party's only just getting started!
If you say yes then I'm serious, if you say no then I'm joking!
Oh my god! Those guys are stealing my car!
No, actually, see I had to pee, 'cause I can't use public bathrooms because the doodie parasites.
Ok, that's ok. I'm fine. I'm... oh!
Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife?
I'm not your brother.
And in the meantime you better let him drive. Does he have a license?
Oh y'know, I didn't think of it that way. You're right. You're right. So, can I ask you a question?
Awwwwwwww.
Yeah, but it-it-it's my whole life-you come to England.
Oh umm, y'know I think it would be better if we just save it.
Yes.
Yes!!
Yeah but it wasn't for me, it was for a friend.
Hello darlings.
And that's not all I'm allergic to.
Stupid Jack, the word is stupid.
You can forget about Emily, she's not with us.
Well, I was probably going to do it at some point.
Certainly. Dr. Geller, which 1965 Shirelles hit was later covered by a popular British invasion band?
No. Nothing. Imagine, if she had just stepped off that curb a few seconds later.
Nice to meet you. I wish you'd told me we were having company, I'd fix myself up!
Hey!
It was great.
I thought it went very well.
Oh, I was going to offer you my apartment.
Hey!
That's my wife!!! Get out!
Uh, yeah I think I did.
What're we looking at? That blue freckle?
I mean hey! I just met you, I don't know you from Adam. ...Only child, right? Parents divorced before you hit puberty.
I love both of you!
I'd love some juice. Thanks.
Hey!
Who?!
It's just so weird, two people look so much alike, and so different.
Thanks. You're, uh, you're a good kid.
Ah! I missed you.
Ah well, I-I'm seeing someone.
I will flip you for it.
Well, now we've gotta find something fun for you!
Incidentally, when are you coming back?
Oh, I couldn't eat now.
We really do feel bad about this though.
Oh. Well, so we have to hide our relationship from one more person. Big deal. Besides, it's kinda fun hiding.
Sorry David, but she really has to know this.

Great!
Oh, wow. I can't believe you're throwing that in my face.
So what? I mean if even I can get past that, it shouldn't bother you. And you don't have to like her. You just have to accept the fact that I do. I mean, if you even can't be civil to the woman I love...
Sorry, it's not.
Hey, how's my favorite parenting team doing?
I can't!!
And who may I say is calling?
Elizabeth!
Yeah, that's my job. Alright, look up. . . look down, now open your eyes, now look down. That's right, look into the light. Now look at me. . . OK. Your eyes look good. Those are good eyes.
No.
That's so sweet. Would you like to come in and say good-bye? I'm sure it would mean a lot to her.
I just had the hardest day. Those bags are so heavy.
Hey.
I was thinking about taking my lunch break.
Oh?
You are!
Hey Ross!
No, I don't know him.
Excuse me.
Why?
Let me tell you what I think might be going on. No-no-no, don't look at the table. Look at me. Okay, I think somebody asked someone to move in with them. And I think someone said, "Yes" but now she's having doubts because things are moving to fast for someone. Does that sound at all possible to you?
Could you also tell them I'm skinny now?
Hi-hi Joey.
That's not true. If you don't wanna smoke ...
There is a man behind your curtain. I have a mace in my purse.
Yeah... I'm pretty sure I'm still gonna marry him.
No.
Y'know what, I want to talk to you about this so much, but we should probably do it when we could really get into it, are you free for dinner tomorrow night?
Good one. Actually, ah, Terry wants you to take the training again, whenever.
Hi darling.
Get a shot of Monica. Where's Monica.
Oh, where'm I gonna stay, here?
Oh no, no, right I shouldn't have said married. Uh, please don't go freaky on me. I didn't mean it. Well, I didn't say it; I take it back!
"Hi Joey, it's Jane Rogers can't wait for your party tonight"
Honey.. you should always feel the thing. Listen, if that's how you feel about the guy, Monica, dump him!
Madame, if you don't have your boarding pass...
Rachel?
Oh, I hate this but I-I-I have to go. I-I can't miss my flight.
Oh, yeah, um, alright, I kinda need a divorce.
Phoebe writes lots of great songs. Wha... What was that one you sang the other night that everybody just loved?
Yeah, can you guys just throw him in the pool later?
What contracts?
Bye.
All right, I got to run. Tell Monica I say goodbye. And... I'll see you later, neighbor.
Phoebe, it's okay that you feel this way. I mean it is soon. And there's a lot of things we don't know about each other, and I just figure that everything I really like. And the things I don't know, I get to learn about at someplace with both our names on the mailbox.
What?
Diary.
Yeah, all the time. I want the baby to know my voice.
No, of course we're not.
Of course!
Oh, you're going to Minsk?
So Chandler, you're parents must've been thrilled when you told them you were engaged.
Yeah! I mean you're-you're beautiful and smart and sophisticated-a lot of this isn't based on tonight.
Ross, let me show you where the guest room is.
Not really. You...you're blurry, but you still look like Ursula. You're Blursula. Okay wait. Maybe...If I-if I just don't look at you for a while. See? It...it works. I'm not, I'm not angry at all anymore! This is a great date!
Yeah-yeah, it's this huge place, and-and it's got this gorgeous view of the park, and very, very romantic. What do you say?
So, can I get some candy?
I can show you an ID if you want?
but you did say it.
Yeah, I'm serious. It's fun, it's different and no-one else has a name like that!
You never know.
Sure.
Joey, sweetheart, you were fabulous!
Okay.
We're waiting for the candy. Bring out the candy!
Sorry about that. So. What have you been up to?
Right. He's not angry at the room either. Try it again, he owns it! He owns the room. It is his. He owns, owns, owns, owns the room! He owns it!! All right, it's a little weird, but it's getting better. Oh well, I'm gonna miss this woman so much. I don't know what I'm going to do! I mean, it's been 20 years of my life.
Phoebe, you don't have to say that.
Really?! You?
That's me.
Okay, everything looks good. Here it is on the screen. Here is your uterus. And right here is your baby.
I'll never remember all of that. So uh, what's the deal? Rachel comes home, people pop out and yell stuff, is that it?
Can't you see what's going on here, this man is dying.
Woah, woah, woah, what're, what're you talkin' about man.
She may have died?
Sophie, get in here!
Oh my God! What's wrong with your baby?!
Are... are you kidding? You know, when you don't see someone for a long time, a-a-and you kind of build them up in your head and you start thinking about: Come on, don't be crazy. Nobody is that beautiful, but... well, you are. Well, so, uhm... are you seeing... anyone?
Don't worry about it. It's not a problem.
Sure, he was in your "band"?
Absolutely! Is Friday okay?
All right, kids. Here's the deal. According to my client's will, he wants to leave all his earthly possessions to "the noisy girls in the apartment above mine".
Well then I guess then I-I would I would have to say C.
The library board has had a lot of complaints from parents about some of the stuff in your songs.
Okay, well, my cell phone number is right here on the counter, please help yourself to anything in the fridge.
Zelner.
Just so I know, if I had asked first...
It's gonna be an open casket, y'know, so at least I'll- I get to see him again.
We will.
Okay. Chandler, did your dad ever hug you?
Oh, crap!
Oh... I'm back!
...taking a long walk, and then there's the one that's proved most effective: sex.
Its such a slap in the face. I'm your sister and you would give your baby to these strangers over me.
Wine?
"Hey Chandler, it's Charlie"
Hi. I'm Rob Dohnen.
Ameri-ccan.
And Rog.
Hey, hey. Good to meet you, Roger.
Hey Rach, I just heard. I'm so sorry.
Oh that's great! You are the best!
Whoa! Big octopus.
Monica... Hey Mon, I have a question. Is Leroy the baddest man in the whole damn town or the fattest man in the whole damn town?
It says to call this number if you're not completely satisfied with this candy bar. Well, I'm not completely satisfied.
Yes?
You okay, kiddo?
Hi!
You spend half your life in the bathroom, why don't you ever go out the bloody window!
Um... Charlie, this is Rachel's sister Amy. Amy, this is Charlie.
I dropped a cup.
That might be fun.
Well, what was supposed to happen?
Are you serious?
Umm, this is great wine.
I'm adopted?!
Ohhhh!
Well...I Only Have One Thing To Do Today. I guess I could push it back.
Sure, I'd like that.
Also, I've just been working on this big presentation for tomorrow.
Mmmm... Ethan is my... boyfriend.
Well sweetie, we have a surprise for you. We're turning your room into a gym.
Okay, and listen don't forget to bring your jazz shoes for the dance audition.
Yeah!
I know. With Gukki.
If you leave now, I will chop off my hand and give it too you!
No, not getting my bra!
Hey! Smile!
Yes! Yeah! Joey has great hair! Umm, I'm basically done here. Just let me get this off your neck.
You have three new messages.
You wear bi-focals?
Why don't you like me! Chapter one: my first period.
No, Gary Collins is the host. You'll be answering the phones.
Sure you did! You came in, you got all awkward, and you ran into the bedroom. You were shouting, "Joey! Joey!" Bye Rach.
Okay then, would you like to lie down on the table?
Oh, OK. Oh, sorry.
Actually, giving birth to three babies isn't that different from giving birth to one.
Question. You're not dating anybody, are you, because I met somebody who would be perfect for you.
I know! And I'm just getting out of a marriage, I mean talk about meant to be!
I know. I know, and when he proposed to me, everyone said "Don't do it, he's just gonna do to you what he did to Rachel," and now I feel so stupid.
Oh it's nothing, it just says that you can't sue the city if you scrap your knee or y'know, get your head blown off.
I didn't need to know that. I guess 21 years is a lot. I mean, hell, I'm a whole person who can drink older than you.
What?!
Daddy!!
What is taking so long?! I mean whatever!
That's right.
With a K.
Ooh, steer clear of you.
Hey, Knick fan, am I interested in your views on fatherhood? Uh, no.
Well, Jamie was the name of Susan's first girlfriend, so we went back to Jordie.
I guess we just keep dancing.
You don't think this is too fast.
I love you!
I'm sorry guys, closed set.
I'll help you dial.
I'm sorry that's who I am. I'm a positive person.
You are so precious, I could just take you home.
No! No dessert, just a check, please.
Oh, who's this little guy?!
What is going on?
Ross and Emily have made their declarations and it gives me great pleasure to declare them husband and wife.
Car's waiting downstairs, I just wanted to drop off these copies of my book for your friends. Anything you want from Lisbon?
It is the right time.
Knick fan?
Anyway, she burned all of my clothes. I got away with two things. This suit and what turned out to be a skirt.
Mr. Geller.
Uh, absolutely, yeah, sEnd her in. Hi.
I'm in my boss's car!
I'm sorry there wasn't better news from your test last week but I wanted to talk to you about your options.
Hi. Well, look, I was just gonna leave a message, isn't tonight your, your big anniversary dinner?
I won't! Until I have my next cigarette.
Yeah, sure.
And then, and then you said that thing about, about bringing the Mesozoic era in the 21st century.
Oh man!!
Ow!!
Well then, uh, I uhh, guess that's me. Anyone else need to go on the elevator? Dr. Horton, Dr. Wong?
'Cause the sweat's getting in my eyes and its burning.
I know! Why don't you get drunk! That worked for a lot of girls in my high school.
Right, yeah, cause its close to where I live, and the aprons are really cute.
You got a problem with that?
Good-bye and God speed, Hope Brady.
Still rolling, annnnd action!
Uh, ow.
I must say it's nice to see you back on your feet.
I know, I probably shouldn't even tell you this, but I'm pretty much totally intimidated by you.
A couple of hours, I feel awful.
So, what do you think of my daughter in the apron with the big job?
Umm, it's a lollipop and a uh, a home pregnancy test.
That's very interesting, ya know, 'cause that's exactly what someone who slept with her would say.
Hey, everybody!
My cousin's a paleontologist.
You know what? When I moved in here I thought: This is gonna be so great. Just us sisters, back together again like when we were kids, except without that stupid Jill... Oh! Who has gotten fat by the way...
Oh yes! You're an excellent chef! As a person you're a little...
O-kay... Henrietta, you didn't get all the points you needed, so that means Gene, you are going to the winners circle to try for ten thousand dollars! And you're gonna be going there with Joey Tribbiani.
Guess what? Ben is going to be in a TV commercial!
Okay, I should, I should probably be getting back to my thing now. See ya.
Son, I had to shave my ears for tonight. You can do this.
I'm sorry, what's going on?
I'll see you tomorrow.
But why? He loves this...this Emily person. No good can come of this.
Well why not? So you can spend your time with this tramp?!
No, no, no, she's nice but, y'know, it just it made me realize that I'm just not, I'm just not ready to be dating, y'know?
What was that?
No. But, Monica and I were talking, and-and I was so upset about the hall being knocked down, and she suggested that we put the wedding off for a bit.
Phoebe, your next client's in the waiting room.
Wow! I had no idea! But you know, I could always find another masseuse.
Oh, really.
Knock knock!How are we today? Any nausea?
I'm in the middle...
A lesbian?
No-ho-ho! Yeah. I mean, no-no-no-no-no, don't you worry, I'm sure with your qualifications you won't need to sleep with some guy to get that job. Although, I might need some convincing.
You're doing great, you're doing fine.
Youre doing it again.
Come on, lady!
May I help you?
No.
Right. Are you looking for Jack's parents to discuss the problems he's having with Ben? Yeah. Because I really do think the parents should sit down and have a conversation.
Thanks Phoebe!
Hey, you.
Would you like to see a semi-private room?
Hello Tilly.
Drake!
So anyway we really... Honey, we're just smoking all over you.
No, we are. I'm sad.
Is it a good sign that they asked us to hang around after the audition?
Good one.
Oh... oh...
Ross, I'm only ringing to say stop harassing my relatives. Good-bye!
This will be your phone.
I got a little drunk...and naked.
Y'know what, don't be. This is not, don't be, 'cause it's not so bad.
Well ah, the short version is, I ah pursued her for a couple of months, then I gave her a check for 20,000 dollars, and she was mine.
Anyway uh, I'll get moving on that new door.
I er... I hope you don't mind. I used some of my home-made lotion on Emma. It's a mixture of calendula and honey cream. It'll dry that rash right up. Plus... It keeps the hands young...
Hey, Weird Girl.
Hey!
What, you can do it in the parking lot of a Taco Bell, but you can't do it at a doctor's office?
It's never gonna happen again right?
I brought you something.
I had a great time.
Am I too late?!
Hallelujah!
Jack?
Mmm-hmm. Because I know that this isn't the end.
Joey describe these things associated with the United States congress. Give me 20 seconds on the clock please. Ready? Go!
Thanks. Great so we can all go together! I gotta run. Catch you later!
Yes, but uhm... You should know... she really likes you. I-In fact I-I-I don't think you realise j-just how lucky you are fella.
Yeah, well, anyhoo, here is your check. Thank you for all the trouble you went through. Um, listen, you didn't eat a lot of it while you were cooking, did you?
What are you going to do? Kill him? Like you did with Charles?!
No, I think it's cute.
I always wanted to play piano professionally, and I figured if I don't do this now, I never will.
Oh my god, Todd! What the hell did you do?
But... I-I-It's nice... A-a-and... nice is good. A-a-and good is not bad, ergo, w-w-we should keep kissing.
Right. Right. Ross. So what's the deal with you guys? I don't want to get in the middle of anything.
Why? What you'd do?
Because that would be fantastic. What? You wanna kiss me?
Yeah! Oh my God!
It's not looking good.
Well then you can't have any. Bear overboard! I think he's drowning. Hey fellows! Grab on a Sugar-O... save yourself! "Help! I'm drowning! Help!"
Yeah, me too.
I didn't do that.
I'll call you later. Bye Ross.
Sweetie, you think you can get in there?
Wooooo!!!!
I'm fine! I'd fight tonight, if they'd let me. See this circle I'm marking off here? This is my zone of terror.
I'm good!
Are you kidding? I take credit for Paul. Y'know before me, there was no snap in his turtle for two years.
That's... my boy.
Wow, my flat is twice this size!
You OK?
I always thought that too. Tell me, what does your father do?
Oookay. Are you aware that possession of an illegal exotic is, uh, punishable by up to two years in prison and confiscation of the animal?
Oh, yes Elizabeth. Ah, 871.
Yes.
Really?
That sucks. I was buried in an avalanche.
No kidding.
Anyway I just, uh, I think it's for the best.
Hey, it's not my business, besides it's probably a good thing. We really would have been spoiling the children, all those food, and warm clothing...
Great!
...Yes?
This isn't your toe, this is a small, very cold piece of carrot.
Great.
Red Barbra?
Oh my gosh, that was so lame. Like a pajmena could be a rug!
You're that stupid.
What about the duck?
You do not need to smoke. Cigarettes don't control you. You are a strong, confident woman, who does not need to smoke. A strong, confident woman, who does not need to smoke.
Sir! I'm afraid I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
Well, he better not come by here. He can't see the bride in the wedding dress.
I - I can't believe I'm crying in front of you. You must think I'm so pathetic.
Why? Where are you going?
No.
You are so dead! I'm gonna get you.
I'm just going to need to see your passport.
You want me to cancel it?
Ahh, thanks but no. You see I-I think I'm ready to dance with girls.
Don't go anywhere, I'll be right back.
That's so great for you guys!
And finally that you were unable to consummate the marriage. Well, that makes sense since you're gay and addicted to heroin.
You were incredible!
Okay, now I've really have to go!
Pizza!
Phoebe and I are moving in together.
Take thee, EM-I-LY...
Blind?
Gavin Mitchelle's office.
You don't have to go home tonight, do you?
Yeah.
C'mon people, back up please, back up, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon.
Okay, fine, whatever. Welcome to the building.
I'm Scott.
Excuse me?
Hey!
Yeah, whatever. Oh no.
What happened to the library?
Well, we determined the cause of the fire.
Dear?
Oh, well I tell Issac everything.
Jack, look at this.
No...
All right, see ya Pheebs.
What?!
Oh, and he's got such a good heart! Doesn't he have a good heart?
Okay. Let's do it again.
-make the decision-
Also a good gift? Underwear.
So, all right.
Nora!
Yeah all that's gone. It's basically just a simple question and answer game now.
Well, he may be now, because I think I hit him with my car.
Well our service is not grossly incompetent.
Absolutely!
It does. It feels really good!
See ya.
Hey Joey, you wanted to talk to me?
Hi. And batting for Sarah, Ross Geller, 872. Although, it looks like you bought an awful lot of cookies yourself.
wow. They must put a lot of makeup on you.
Breathe.
Hold on! You got her pregnant?
Yeah, you can melt art. Hey, can I use your phone?
Well, don't think I haven't noticed your potential. Well, I've got a project for you that's a lot more related to fashion. How does that sound?
Wait! Where's my shoes?
No, I have some turning 21 to do.
Still?
You didn't want me to marry the old guy with the great apartment. Then, I tried to help your daughter to de-emphasize her flaws And suddenly I am the bad guy?
Here Mitzi! Here Mitzi!
Yeah! I'm just going down there to relax and hang out with my friends.
Thank you so much for letting me do this. Public bathrooms freak me out, I can't even pee, let alone doanything else.
They're wildly unpopular.
Hey, you don't have to smile. You just have to dance.
Well, it's technically not a zoo per se, it's more of an interactive wildlife experience. Let me ask you some questions about, is it, uh, Marcel?
Mrs. Altman? She also made out with Takaka Ci-Kek the night before he went back to Thailand.
Flight's in an hour. I-I gotta go.
I now find you shallow and um, a dork. All right, bye.
Yeah!
E-e-excuse me?
It's actually a bassinet.
Sure.
I'll be right back.
Well, she would take her keys and try to jam them...
And I do have one seat left.
I'll take "You crossed the line".
Okay look, Ross, just so you know that since Lizzie likes you so much, I've decided to accept the fact that you're going out with her.
That I was not expecting.
Thank you, it's my mom's. So this is the kitchen.
It's made from eggs!
Joey, right?
Hey, lovely! Come, talk to me a minute!
I know it's really lame, but I got these tickets from my boss and-Oh no! No! No! My God!
Yeah, we had a really great night and in the morning he promised he would call me and he didn't.
Hi.
WE WON!! Thank you! Yes!
Didn't you feel so stupid that you didn't see the signs? My fiance was always going away on these long weekends with his tennis partner.
Daryl Hannah.
What's the matter honey? Did you see a little mouse?
I'm sorry... Ross Geller... Benjamin Hobart.
Just do it.
Cut!
So, ehm... I'm proposing to Pheobe tonight.
Hi!
Hmm, noodle soup.
Rach, I'm sorry, but you didn't give me any contracts!
Hi!
Joey!
Frank Jr. Jr.!!
Why?
So, you know... I have a little time. If you... if you want to...
Now it also says here that you lied about your sexual preference before marriage?
What woman?!
Well...I really have high hopes for my band.
You bitch. You just think you're so perfect. With your new baby and your, your small apartment. Well let me tell you something. Your baby isn't even that cute.
...and that was all before 10 o'clock. The caterer rang and said it was going to be Chicken Kiev instead of Chicken Tarragon. And then the florist phoned to say there aren't any tulips. Oh, and the chilliest has carpel-tunel syndrome. We're not gonna be...
Thank you!
Oh my God! This is so exciting! Well, get back in there! I'll guard the door!
Um, yeah, um, twin thing.
I do love it, and I love your name. I love Princess Consuela.
So this is it? Victor?
Hi, Ross. Yes, it's me. How did you know?
So Santa's coming?
Well, then if there's nothing else, then the two of us should talk.
Yeah, I really cherish these moments, 'cause before you know it, they're gonna be awake again.
Aunt Phoebe, what are you doing here?
How long is this gonna take? 'Cause I got another critic to go yell at.
How can I help you?
Nice hair. What'd ya do? Swim here?
May I have the rings? Emily, place this ring on Ross's finger as a symbol of your bond everlasting. Ross, place this ring in Emily's hand as a symbol of the love that encircles you forever.
It's a haven. A third-floor paradise. A modern-day Eden in the midst...
In fact we're playing a game at the park tomorrow. You're welcome to play too if you want.
Mm! Seems like I would've remembered you!
The Waltham Residence.
Understood. So, what'd you say back then?
Yeah, nothing happen. You could cut the sexual tension in here with a knife.
What?
C'mere, Patti.
"I'd like to go for a walk", uhm "scratch my belly".
Oh, that's better then.
How's it gonna be all right?!
I hate you!!
Ready? "What the hell are you still doing here?"
Really?
Uh-oh...
Trick or treat!
You're a joker Bing.
So we never got to hear about your wedding!
Not that great. It's almost if people don't want to hear that their babies are ugly.
You look beautiful this evening.
Can I ask what-Come on in.
No, she was this really dorky girl in high school that used to follow Rachel around like a puppy dog.
This is the final boarding call for Flight 664 to Yemen.
Hey, y'know, Alice is gonna be here so soon, you couldn't just like do me a favor and like, like hold them in?
Okay...
Hi.
No-no-no, we'll move you just stay right there.
Oh honey, come on, have a sense of humour, you've never been able to laugh at yourself.
Im sorry, I didnt get... Susan is?
Wha-, n-, no. I mean it's just a bunch of pretty people runnin' around on the beach, ya know.
To see who goes first, you got a quarter?
We're actually at the end of one of our research cycles, so we're not looking for applicants right now.
Well... hey, the key works...!
As my lawfully wedded wife, in sickness and in health, till death parts us.
Besides, I can't leave until their Christmas party downstairs clears out; there are some *pissed off* insurance people looking for that ham.
Hey!
You know what makes the itching even worse?
Thanks a lot. Hey Christine, I got it!
Which one?
And we'll need to have witnesses who can testify that you were not of uh, sound mind.
Thank you.
Hey! Okay! Well thanks for coming out to see me. I just-I just thought it would be a very good idea to talk about this baby stuff in person. Y'know...
If you're talking about feminism, I think you're right.
Are you here for tickets?
No, pretty much just a towel.
Hi! I'm sorry, I know it's after hours but I really need candy.
Yeah?
Look, I'll just give you this and go.
Nobody sees the king!
Is this your first appology?
Sure!
I missed you at work today. How are you feeling?
No, Frank.
So good then! We'll see you at Riverside Park at 2:00! Cheers!
That is so sweet!
Wayne Gretzky.
Hello, sweetheart.
Well, it was quite large. I-I-I-I-I had to throw most of it away.
Yeah.
Oh hi Rachel.
I was just being polite, but, alright.
And this is Duncan and Erin, they're gonna help us out with the audition. So uh, let's get the camera rolling.
No.
Oh, no, honey, I mean, don't worry, I like hanging out with those guys. It's fun for me. They're different than my other friends, they don't start sentences with, 'You know who just died shoveling snow?'
Do you?
So what did you do today?
Sorry, I don't know any Earl.
Oh, thanks! That's so sweet!
I remember when we first got engaged.
Shhhh!
Oh my God, I love your shirt!
Can I do it to you?
No, I just thought it was cute.
Dr. Geller?
Its pretty ugly. We havent seen an ANUS this bad since the seventies.
Don't touch him!
Hey, what kind of puppy do you think I should get?
But there'll be perhaps 30 people under you so you can dump a certain amount on them.
I really don't think he does. And y'know what? Maybe you guys could help clue him in. Y'know, tell him I'm-I'm not interested in a serious relationship or something.
It's me!
Well, I'm not I'm not at all surprised they feel that way.
Bye Phoebe.
Wow you look so beautiful! If I knew you, I'd cry.
How do you do. Ooh, you two girls were outstanding! Did they have representation?
So we're doing it?
Hey! You're in a play! I didn't know you could dance! You had a beard!
Okayyy!
Her name's Debra.
Hmm.
Mom, Dad, what are you guys doing here?
E!
Y'know what, I gotta go. And thank you so much for coming.
Look, I am just not strong enough to be in a codependent relationship right now, OK?
Never mind, it's open.
Hi sweetie. Hi, can I talk to you for a second?
You're right.
Oh, yeahhhhh!!!
I'll go.
Susan! Hi!
Excuse me. You should check this out, tell the other tenants. Apparently he's running around looking for some kind of a hot girl.
Ohhhhhh!
Well Lilly, when you see Lilly would you give her that, that note? Because I wanted to talk to her at the memorial but, well I pictured her getting mad at me the way you got mad at me and I well, I chickened out. So, uh, I wrote her that note, would you give it to her please?
Yeah, but I didn't get to see it.
Hey Mon! Hey Chann! Just gettin' a soda!
That sounds great. My God this is the most comfortable couch I've ever sat on in my entire life.
Uh, they're not in it.
Hold on, y'know I just got a box of Cubans, maybe I bring them by your office around uh, five?
Oh, don't worry I have plenty of sun block, it's SPF-30.
Aaaahhhhhhh.
You are!
Miss? Are you boarding the plane?
Of course I do.
Oh my God! That was flirting?!
You must be Rachel, I'm Erin.
Let's get you into wardrobe for a fitting.
That saves us a conversation.
I don't know about the hands, but the guy that was here before me just went to the bathroom.
Oh great!
I just called a friend of mine.
And I'm his friend, Dr.Rosen.
Thanks. You wanna hear something funny?
I wonder if its time for you to rejoin our team at the museum?
Huh?
You are so bad!
Yeah.
Okay, now I'm really late.
Ok, you really want me out?
I bet it's fast.
Have you felt Rachel's cervix Ross?
Myron. Hmm... I told you he was old!
Hey.
Who's out there?
Anyway, hopefully, I'll see you around sometime.
Y'know, every year I say I'm gonna send out holiday cards and I never do it. Do you wanna, do you wanna send this one out together?
Hey! Hey! Hey! This is 92.3, WXRK, K-Rock for our $1,000 daily challenge.
It's Joey right?
Yeah, that's what I drive. I make four bucks an hour, I saved up for 350 years!
It looks like her.
Okay. Let's move on.
So! Me neither! God, Mary-Angela was right you do have the softest lips.
Bye.
So? Huh? What do you think?
I got it!
I'll take care of it.
Okay, let's try this one more time.
No more so than acting.
What, you don't think they can hear sounds in there?
Well hi, I'm Jenny Boone. I'm the new teacher here.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Listen, I know, I may be way out of bounds here, but is there any chance you will take me back?
No.
Okay, but it's Valentine's Day!
Anyway, I just wanna give you a heads up.
Oh, it's just... It's up to you. It's your name. You've got to live with it.
That's so great for you guys!
Every actor at one time or another-opp! Every actor thinks he stinks, even Lawrence Oliver at sometimes thought he stank, Bob Redford won't even watch himself.
So it looks like you've got some great experience here. Let's see ahh, reason for leaving last job?
No... no...
I'm Amanda.
Think she got fired at Riffs?
Well, yes, yes, the best doctor in all of Salem, Dr. Drake Remore.
You know I'm trying to think of the last time I opened a door and you weren't there, Phoebe are you ok?
I guess.
Okay, all right... Get ready ladies!
It's so cool man, it's so, it's just 'cause being with her is so much better than like not being with her.
I don't know anything about music, but I think you're really, really great.
Tag Jones.
She's probably not even very pretty, just young enough so that everything is still pointing up.
Ok, fine, these rats are our responsibility. What happens when they mate and there are hundreds of them?
Well, while you were on your baby vacation I was doing your job.
Oh, Ben! Hey, buddy!
I am?
Eh, worth a shot. Look Joey, let me know where you're staying, okay?
Hi...
Oh hi! Well, I guess that's two out of three, Joey.
...the scotch and the cigarettes...
Really! You-you sail?
Hello Skidmark.
Ok!
You may kiss the bride.
No, I mean happy.
Joey!
That's the whole part?
It's not Rick.
How exciting!
Yes, that's Raspberry coule.
Well, um, for the past few years I've been working.. ...which is funny because, that wasn't even my major.
What is the name of your roommate who is very, very sorry and would do anything...
But well, now that we're together again, I don't ever want to be apart. So, to that end...
...and this guy...
You're kidding me!
But... ergo...
Y'know uh, actually I-I-I should get going.
Oh great!
You wanna get married?
You put this in your coffee.
You can do this. Just breathe.
So anyway I sent the designs over to Ralph and he's very excited about the line.
Hey.
It's, uh, it's Paul.
Lights please? And thats having a baby. Next week is our final class.
What are you doing?
Look, the only who stands to get hurt is me. And I'm okay with that.
Ha! Ahhhhhhh!
Sorry.
I can't say.
What a relief. It has all the numbers of the people in her prayer chain.
Well ah, I've been doing a lot of thinking, and I look at my life...
Thanks Rachel. And-and don't forget you-you can come visit her anytime you want.
No, it was. It was very very good.
Yeah. Ever since you flashed my badge at me, I kinda can't stop thinking about you. You're the prettiest, fake undercover whore I've ever seen.
Do I have a minute to go to the bathroom?
Phoebe! Hi!
It's not a game Ross, a woman died on my table today.
Oh umm, I-I don't know if I want to wear a woman's shirt.
Hurry up I gotta pray!!
And if you see Rita Moreno, let her know I'm looking for her.
I just came by to give you a kiss, I have to go pick up the baby, so. I'll see you later sweetheart, you too Chandler.
The next tour of the wine cellar will plan in two in-in minutes...
You're strict.
Smelly cat, smel-ly cat...
Oh, no! This is work. I should call in. Can you excuse me?
Oh, me too...
Yes! Yes! You did!
Well, I mean... It sounds good to me. And that way we can save up, come back in a few years and make an even bigger donation.
Oh, you thought, huh? Yeah, well that didn't really work out too well for you did it you idiot!! What are you?! A moron!! Huh?! It says D-13! Okay?! Look you're surrounded by even numbers!! Did that give you some clue?!
No.
Like the candy?
Come on!
Oh Hans.
Pizza delivery!
Okay, so let me just get this straight. You're accusing me of cheating on you, and insulting my performance?
Dope!
Y'know, it's funny, but when we were studying communicable diseases...
Bite me, blondie!
I'm sorry. I am such a doofus. I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.
Alright, Monica dear, I'm gonna hit the road. Now I've left my 10 verbs on the table. And you be sure and send me that finished poem.
I was passin' by and I saw that you were playing tonight, it's kinda cool seeing you up there.
Alright, so now you're doing this whole book tour thing, how is that going?
No.
What?!
Do we have a name yet?
It seemed like such a simple idea.
Yes, the Philange is fixed. As a matter of fact, we put a whole lot of extra Philanges onboard, just in case.
Try. There's my little girl.
I left a Belgian waffle out here, did you take it?
All right, Carol, I need you to keep pushing. I need Excuse me, could I have this?
I'm pregnant.
Is your back feeling better?
We're going to take Erica to recovery now.
You know, whatever we pick, she would've told us it's the wrong one.
Yeah?
Thank you.
Oh Joey!
I'll be right back. Make yourself comfortable.
Great! How about you wanted to go the Italian place down on Bleaker Street right?
How are you? Look, you guys wanna meet the group? Come on. So, are you one of the ones who fooled around with my dad?
Yeah...
Your monkey found a new career, in the entertainment field. That's all I know.
Ohh, I love Chinese! How did you know I love Chinese?!
I live upstate.
Chandler Bing?
Oh, I know and he's soo sweet! Listen, he said he was going to call, so put him straight through.
Me too!
Excuse me, hi. I was hoping I would run into you. Can we talk?
Oh, okay.
Good God Bing I...well I can't say I'm altogether surprised, I saw the way she looked at you, and there was no love there. And the way she looked at me, pure lust.
No! Come on!
No-no it's okay. It's just that ah, I thought we had something pretty special here. And y'know I-I felt like you were someone I could finally open up to, and... That there's so much in me I have to share with you yet.
Hey Mon.
Oh, my god, I am so glad you called me. I had the most supremely awful day.
You thought I was Rachel?
Can't you figure that out based on my date of birth?
I know. That's what I told her.
Oh wow. I really wish you'd call me.
We weren't but we had one class together. He was such a great guy and he talked so passionately about science. I always remembered him.
Oh, you know, the usual, teaching aerobics, partying way too much. Oh, and in case you were wondering, those are my legs on the new James Bond poster.
Hey.
Can't have?! Excuse me, the only thing I can't have is dairy!
No, I'm bored with you now. I'm going to cut you off.
I thought I heard voices. You must be Chandler.
Whaddyou mean?
But, I was curious; do you have any plans for tonight?
Hey Pheebs! How's it going?!
It can be anything you want.
No, I'm telling you last night was like umm, all my birthdays, both graduations, plus the barn raising scene in Witness.
More turkey Mr. Chandler?
Y'know, when I saw you at the store last week, it was probably the first time I ever mentally undressed an elf.
Dysprosium.
I say, punch him Joey.
I felt it!
You by the door. In or out?
Wow!
Phoebe, I love you. I mean, I missed you so much these last few months and I thought we were apart for a good reason, but then I suddenly realized that there was no reason good enough to keep me from spending the rest of my life with you.
I silk-screen t-shirts now.
This isn't fair.
So you look like you're doing really well! I guess you're mugging days are behind you?
Ok Geller. Last day of the conference, you know what happens to the keynote speaker.
Oh, just updating the phonebook.
Susan and I live together.
Why?!
Ross is coming. Great! I love Ross!
Thank you.
I will.
I have a question about this scene.
Old? Yeah! But he travels a lot, so he's hardly ever there.
Shoot! Shoot! Shoot!
Here you go.
That's really a day shoe.
You look really beautiful.
Ah, just one other thing.
Chandler.
I miss you already!!
...just because you're not in love with the guy you can't...
Bye.
Oh, well that's not so crazy.
What are you doing? I thought you don't share food.
You still don't know my name, do you?
Hey, Rachel.
Here we go gentlemen, here we go! Are you ready? Are you ready? Let's get it on!!
I mean, come on, buddy, get a real car!
That's fine, thank you.
No problem. So who's the party for?
Ms. Green would like to establish some ground rules before she comes out. She would appreciate it if you don't use the words old or downhill or they still look pretty damn good.
I just remembered, I have to do something.
Hi, I'm Precious, who are you?
It's okay...
I don't know what to say, Benji. This is all so.... romantic.
Enter Amy!
Come on, Erica, start pushing again now.
You do?
Two pounds of Moca Java please.
Great! That's great Monica! Great! Now, Chandler, you want to give us a smile?
Also Monday.
I know I didn't do well on my midterms and stuff but, I was kinda hoping you could change my grade.
Become a drama critic!
Uh actually, I'd like to speak with both of you.
Okay, so...no toner today. Thanks anyway, bye-bye.
Yes. Are you one of the retarded cousins?
Yeah. Hate him.
I don't know. Let me see the ring.
That won't be necessary.
Buon Giorno, Bella Phoebe!
I don't know... I can make my pecs dance... I can pick up a dollar bill with my butt cheeks... I can go to that special place inside me where I feel no shame.
I don't know, I mean, y'know, this is the city y'know, I just, I mean, I don't know.
I hear you can get people out of here.
No! I mean you're a really nice guy and I'm happy to be your roommate and your friend, I'm just y'know, I just don't feel that way about you.
Where are they?
Hi.
Look at that.
That's a good one.
Ow!
Well they could be true.
Look, you don't have to talk to it. You can sing to it if you want.
I know a great little place.
Wow, excuse me, sir, do you have a boarding pass?
Wow, you catch on quick.
What?! Why?
It's ok. Ho-honest mistake.
It didn't click.
Rachel.
You can say that again Mac.
Yeah? You found them!! Y'know what? I'm not even going to gloat. I'm just really relived this whole thing is over.
Umm uh, I'll make some coffee and we can uh, chat.
Let's get started. Five, six, a-five six seven eight...
Oh, there they are! I-I dropped my keys.
I've gotta call my friend Mary and tell her how good this is, from Monica's room.
Thank you.
Well y'know about the tongue thing, y'know, and how I told you about my likes and my dislikes...
Oh, I wouldn't miss it for the world.
Phoebe's right Frank. I know it's hard to hear, but it would've been wrong to go through with it. I-I-I was being selfish, even though we, we want the same things now, in the future we may not. Is that it, is that what it is?
Working with blind kids.
Oh well, I'm divorced.
What?
I don't know, I-I guess I just had you pegged as one of those guys who're always 'me, me, me.' But you... you're a giver. You're like the most generous man I ever met. I mean... you're practically a woman.
Ok, nothing from the neck up. Or the waist down. Dana's ovulating.
Naah... I couldn't leave you alone.
Hey Joey, hi! I'm Ray; I'm the producer of the show.
Phoebe, Phoebe relax, it's okay. I mean we never said this was exclusive.
Yeah, well, being a failed scientist doesn't pay quite as well as you might think. That's uhm... one seventieth of a karat. And the clarity is uhm... is quite poor.
I didn't mean a thong... I meant thongs...
Excuse yourself, and go to the bathroom.
Five! Four! Three! Applause!
Eh, why don't we start with the beer?
Yeah. What?
Damnit. OH! Big surprise! The hunk of beef has feelings!
Oh yeah? How'd yours happen?
The doctor says it's a matter of hours.
Oh, it's you. I see you everywhere. I'm Jim, Jim Nelson.
Back on in 30 seconds people!
Yeah, what's the gala for?
I'm sorry. Look, I know this can't bring him back but here, it's just a gesture.
Ross, why don't you give us your toast now?
Hi.
I just came up to say, "Hi!" Hi! And you, sweetie, I'll see you tonight.
Bye.
Ok, ok, I'll throw away the traps.
What?
Really?
Happy birthday.
Okay. (Goes over and fluffs up the pillows on the couch.
No! You're clogging up the chute that I spent a half-hour unclogging!
Mr. Tribbiani.
I'm telling you, you never gave them to me.
Well I don't know, I-I suppose we may have favored you unconsciously, you were a medical marvel! The doctor said your mother could...
Oh, some, that's fine. Some is fine. Some is not a lot. So, it doesn't burn when you pee, does it?
It's a filthy, disgusting habit and I want you to quit now!
Oh, uh... we just uh... happen to wear the same shade.
Really? You don't know what that means to me.
Here we go.
You'd think, wouldn't you? Miss?
Hey!
Oy!
Thank you so much.
Mommy.
Who's they?
Oh, don't worry about it.
No, there was an appliance left on in the bathroom. It's looks like a curling iron.
Oh, yum-yum-yum.
Yeah...
Excuse me, sir! This lady played my quarter, this is my money.
Ough, I know, but I quit smoking!
All right.
Yes!
Aaaaahhh!!
Your food is fantastic! Wow, I really want to talk to you about your menu, once I get some coffees first. Um, anyone want any?
Good night, it was very nice to meet you all.
Oh wow, Ray-ray I have no idea what you're talking about.
I love you Phoebe.
That's the one.
Um, cheers.
I think my character's gonna need a little bit more of reason than that.
What that woman... did. I am not doin that. Its just gonna have to stay in, thats all, everything will be the same, itll just stay in.
We're seriously asking for our money back?
I know you botched that operation on purpose. I can't prove it yet, but when I do, you'll be going to jail for murder. I don't care if you are my brother.
I just left you a message! Ross and I were gonna go grab a bite, but now that you're here, maybe we can go have that dinner.
Yeah, I love you. Okay, bye! Hi!
What?
I'm really happy for you guys.
What's wrong, sweetie?
Yeah, it's my cat. Give me my cat.
Sure.
We're baack!
Really?
Uh, a little bit. She-she-she walked in and I thought she was you and I kissed her and...
What's goin' on?
Anyway, I schedule performers for the childrens libraries around the city and I was just thinking, have you ever thought about playing your songs for kids?
Hey, come dance. What? Are you married? 'Cause that's okay.
Okay.
Hey what?
Mommy is so proud of you. Hi. Hi.
Jarvis Oberblau, Cornell. I mean, the ideas you put forth and, and from someone... so... young... and... .
Previously on Friends.
There isn't a piano here.
Actually, I just gave up my practice.
No! I'm sorry, we were looking for "Baby It's You". Baby It's You.
I'm telling you, I need some smacks. I got a kid starting Dartmouth in the fall.
Nice moustache by the way. When puberty hits that thing's really gonna kick in.
Good.
All right.
No! No boom-boom before big fight!
Oh God! I am so sorry, but... I mean it's... there's so much history between us, you know...
All right.
Oh y'know, we really should quit. Okay, let's quit!
Umh... Kurts Baley?
Julie's cervix is dilated a seven centimeters, that's about four fingers. The doctor let me feel it myself.
Co-founded!
What does Rachel see in this guy? I love Rachel. I wish she was my wife.
Yeah.
Ah, sir a ticket to Yemen is $2,100 and we don't take library cards.
Monica, you asked the question.
Why? So you could hang up on me?
Please, let me do something.
What?
Oh no, it isn't! No! I think Barry is seeing someone in the city.
Please, can't you help me out?
...This is kind of embarrassing, but occasionally after I've been intimate with a man...
Ready?
Like lovers.
Uh-huh!
Where are you from?
Come on. I'll let you lead.
Thanks, any suggestions?
Here you go.
Excuse me, I'm standing right here!
I'd better go, deal...
Where is this party?
I'll see you tomorrow morning!
Cut! Alex, remember you're supposed to cry. Can you cry for us this time?
Absolutely, yeah!
I didn't think you were gay. I do now.
I can't. I can't do it, I can't marry Mindy. I think I'm still in love with you.
Sir, this is not a first class ticket. I'm sorry.
Thank you for your patience, you're the next caller.
I really like waking up with you.
Have fun.
What?
I hate actors.
Thanks daddy.
Night Richard. Good luck Mon.
This guy? Seriously? Later in the day.
And also, congratulations on your wedding.
Thank you.
You're the only one who can save her Drake.
Uh, I-I-I was hoping to run into you here. I didn't know whether I should call or not, y'know I-I was only in town for a few days. And y'know, I didn't want to intrude on your life or-or anything like that, but I-I really wanted to see you and-but I didn't know if you wanted to see me.
Mar-gha.
Night.
*Now* it feels like Christmas.
God. I love you.
Oh!
Happy birthday sweetpea.
Y'know what honey? I got to get back to the hospital.
Bye.
Oh.
My joke wasn't funny.
I know.
Hi, honey.
Hi!
You were right.
Maybe nobody won the jackpot, but there was this guy in here earlier, and he found the ticket on the street, right outside, and won $10,000 .
Yeah! Thank you so much for letting me stay here.
No, it isn't, because you won't let that happen. Don't you know it yet? You love me, Chandler Bing.
This is worse than when he married the lesbian.
I had to cut my hair to get rid of the uh, fogger smell.
Oh, the woman upstairs is very nice. She and her husband have two kids, he's on Wall Street and she...
Wait, you guys think I stole some ring?
I would really like that.
There's nothing wrong with the plane.
As in my grandmother.
Primarily in the Pierre Shale region of South Dakota.
Cut! Wonderful!
No, it's Sam Waterston! Crimes and Misdemeanors, Capricorn One.
Chandler, what-what are you doing?
I'll bet you looked beautiful...
A piece of something: boxer shorts, greeting cards, and what looks like a half-charred pictureWow, that guy's hairier than the Chief!
Listen Joey, seeing as you've got the most experience, I want you to take these dancers and show them the combination.
Well then you really don't need me to live with you.
You're kidding me. Because I'm not seeing anybody, I've just totally made that up.
Hey, what's going on?
That's because they are.
Oh you're serious. Sure!
Are you?!
And there is a collection of Walt Whitman letters on display at the public library.
Ugh, I'm sorry... Ella.
My hamster. I hope she's okay, I haven't seen her in a while. Have a seat.
Ross of.....
So, how's it going?
I'm afraid, I'm not at liberty to divulge that information.
She broke my arm.
Cafeteria.
What are you doing?
I think I accidentally used Monica's boxes to keep the water away from the Porsche.
Oh? Why not?
8,600.
Morning's here! The morning's here!
Well, call me!
Are you just repeating what I'm saying?
You really don't seem like you do. That's...
Hi!
It's me, Carl.
I've missed you so much! No, I'm not gonna ask you to get back together because I know we want different things, but just to be with you one more night.
Please, clean my beakers. I don't get out of the lab much.
Look, I uh, I shouldn'ta come. I-I'd better get going, I don't wanna miss the last train.
I heard that.
Jack.
You're both gonna have to take this up with the judge.
And based on the fact that Mr. Geller is intravenous drug user.
If... if you want to drink, it's OK with me, I've got to get used to it.
Oh, ok. Alright.
I'm not smart. I just wanted so much to...be impulsive once. To be romantic.
You can't ask us son, that's cheating.
Meet me in the nocturnal house in 15 minutes.
Take 36 is up!
Okay.
It's okay! Shh! Hey. Hey. Shhhh.
Miss? Please, sit down!
Hey! So what show are you on?
Hello, funny Valentine.
Hi!
Sure.
Are you interested in this ring?!
Why did you change it, Ella was so much prettier!
Thing?
Oh, well we cut the trip short.
Uh listen, I just-I thought you should know I broke up with Ursula.
Why, did something happen to his falafel cart?
We're just friends.
No! I mean you're a really nice guy and I'm happy to be your roommate and your friend, I'm just y'know, I just don't feel that way about you.
I gotta friend named Mark.
They are delicious.
Why don't we try massaging the breast to stimulate the flow.
I'm just saying, I have a cabin in the Adirondacks if you ever want to get away from the city, well, that'd be just nifty!
Is this your table?
Thank you.
Hi Rachel. Ohh, I've been meaning to ask you. Have you seen the new Ralph Lauren sheets? Ohh, what am I thinking. Of course you have.
Sure!
Uhh, you said there was a party.
Thanks!
Well, we were...
Who? Me the attacker?
Of course I am!
Loosening the saddle on mother's horse was brilliant Fredrick. And the electric fence, inspired.
Listen, to be honest, home deliveries are really a part of my job description.
No, no. She's fair game if you ask me, sorry buddy!
Y'know what? It doesn't matter! Because it is not true!
Good runnin' into you at the bank today, so ah, here's my number, 555-9323. Give me a call. Later.
Let us begin. Dearly beloved...
Your face could be covered with lochs, I wouldn't care.
Chloe, switch with me, there's some guys here that got a crush on you.
If I had one wish, it would be to build a time machine, go back to when I was 7, when Jimmy Hauser had the chicken pox. I would grab that kid and rub him all over my face.
You're a mean old woman.
I... I know you're leaving tonight, but I just have to tell you. I love you.
Really, y'think so? I don't..
What?
What people?
I can't believe this.
Oh please God, let there be a song.
Oh, wait, no your right, no it was perfect and I can't believe that I screwed it up so bad.
Congratulations! Congrats!
Oh, Ross? Ross! You can't put up flyers in here.
Oh, we go way back. Before Monica made an honest man out of him, Chandler used to be my little love muffin! . So? Are you guys thinking of getting this house too? Ooh! Are we gonna have a bidding war? I'd better warn you, I'm a toughie.
Whad'ya mean no?
You know! At the place I told you about last night?
No.
You wouldn't happen to have a very big fork?
Now, nooo! I'm just excited about the restaurant, that's all.
Adios.
See, about a month ago, I wanted to hurt you. More than I've ever wanted to hurt anyone in my life. And I'm an orthodontist.
Hi!
Uh, I am, uh, to say good-bye.
Yeah! Yeah, it's gonna be a small ceremony. Just family. His.
Bye-bye. Oh uh, by the way, the answer is, the Brazil nut.
This doesn't have anything to do with the fact that he is being raised by two women, does it?
Yep. I'm gonna wear these on our date tonight.
You're a genius, Ross.
All ticketed passengers for Flight 1066 to Athens should now be on board.
Yes, it has a head!
Okay!
Weird Girl, what are you doing?
Hi! I-i-is this a bad time?
That's right. Is it true, that the reason you are here in Tulsa is that you fell asleep in a meeting and took the job without realizing what you were saying yes to?
I'm with Hamilton!
Absolutely. You can relax; you did great.
And y'know what I said to him? "I'm gonna hire a lawyer and I'm gonna sue you and take all your money. Then I'm gonna cut you off!"
Well, that's sort of a given, but yes. Anyone else?
Okay. Do you think maybe sometime I could take you out?
Okay. He's cute, he's funny, he's-
Oh I know!!
No, don't say it.
It was you?
Or maybe, maybe he could grab her, and, and, and, and lift her up.
Yeah, it sure does.
Oh right, uhm, Don?
Wow! I usually get to know a girl a little better before I let her spoon me.
Well, maybe after we get reacquainted uh, you can do me.
Hey!
Thank you.
If you need an easy way to remember it, just think of a bag of crap.
So, the Etch-a-Sketch is from you guys?
Yeah, OK.
Ohh, okay. Something didn't quite add up there.
Oh, say no more!
Right.
I'll take it all.
No.
I'm Ted, and I just moved here a month ago, and New York really scares me.
Honey?
You obviously can't keep away from her.
Is that why your hand is pressed against my crotch?
All right!!
Sergei, would like to apologise for my behaviour tonight.
Mr. Simon's been waiting for- Oh my God!
She's gonna be fine. Okay, she's in a more difficult position so you're gonna have to push even harder now. Go! Push!
Yeah.
Wow, that's pretty cool.
I love you too.
Put some pants on kid so I can kick your butt.
Ah, I thought I'd find you here, Nasforatool.
Why?
But maybe we can have dinner later? On the balcony? Will be romantic.
Ahh, nooo!!
Oh, by the way... I'm awesome!!
You make me laugh.
Uh, the sex.
You're dying?!
Yeah.
Oh, come on, you're way out of my league. Everybody in here knows it. Bet that guy over there's probably saying, "ooh, why she out with him? He must be rich!" Well, I'm not!
You don't mind? Well, what do you know, it fits!
You're not dying Hope, you're gonna live a long, healthy life. With me.
How's that coffee comin,' dear?
You're disturbing my oboe practice.
I mean I love spending time with you, y'know I just-I hope we're moving forward. I mean, we should probably talk about that. Don't you think?
Okay, Chandler, come on!
Uh, I gotta apologize for Kara's coffee. Y'know, I feel sorry for it if it ever got in a fight, it's not strong enough to defend itself. Did you hear what I said Bing?
No, not my touchie.
Oops, I'm sorry. Excuse me. Is this the umm, the memorial?
Joey, Joey! We're ready for you!
You put this on a hamburger!
Bert and Ernie!
I forgot my paper.
Oh, please, we're happy to help.
You know, kinda think of it, the capital of Peru IS "vtox". Oh god! Oh!
Well it's somewhere in between. You see, in a strictly technical sense, of course, I'm not uh..., well I, I mean I haven't ever uh...
What?
Oh, we're having spaghetti! That's.... easy.
Sticky shoes, sticky shoes, always make me smile. Sticky shoes, sticky shoes, next time I'll.... avoid the..... pillleeeee.
Ohh! That's great!
I-I-I gotta go, I gotta go. Okay, not without a kiss.
I'm sorry, I do that.
OK, everyone gather up.
Oh Rachel, I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to overwhelm you. It's just that, when those gates open, you... Hard to close 'em. But they are closed now. Believe me.
I mean, thats what this is all about, right? Ross? Ross?
Okay, everybody, we'd like to get this in one take, please. Let's roll it.. water's working .. and... action.
They never did, so if ever see me giving them legal advice just nod along. Shall we?
Congratulations! You now just crossed the line into completely useless. Get out.
So, are you a member of any gym.
Joey, I'm gonna tell you the same thing I told Al Minser and his pyramid of dogs. Take any job you can get and don't make on the floor.
Well, if I had to chose right now, which by the way I find really weird, I would have to say, Chandler.
No. Sweetie, you're gonna be fine.
Yeah, y'know when we found out we were going to have a baby, y'know I figured y'know like I should y'know have like a career-and I love refrigerators!
Heh... y'know?
I'm sorry. Semi-private rooms are all we have.
Stop the bus! Wait! Wait! Wait!
So you work at Bloomingdale's, huh? My mom calls it Bloomies.
Relax. It's just Issac's D.J.-ing at the Philly. You should come.
Oh umm, I'm the solar system. Yeah, my students helped me make it-I teach the second grade.
Well, we just had a terrible lunch today at Reattica. What is with all the sun-dried tomatoes at that place?
No.
The bathroom is down the hall, to your left.
Of course I do.
Hey!
Vicrum?
Yes, it was very offensive to my people!
And then right, right when the scene ends, he could take her with this raw, animal....
Look at this, it's from the cellars of Ernest and Tova Borgnine, so how could we resist?
Oh great! I'll keep it in my butt with your nose.
I!
What?
And you know, you can just give me my stuff whenever you want.
Three for excavation and two for analysis.
hmmm...
No, I was talking about your bedding.
'Cause every time I see your face, I can't help but fall from grace. I know.....
Yay!
Yeah. It's gonna be weird.
Touchet, touchet, Miss Americccan pie. Ameri-ccan.
Oh, let me see what I can do. There are some first class seats available.
That's it. That's my whole name.
No, no, no, no, no!
Hey.
Uh, no. But I could pretend to strip, but that's gonna cost extra. Okay, here's the extras, handcuffs, spanking...
Hi!
I'll never understand you lesbians. So baby, tell me...what is new with you.
"Listen, oh... it turns I got the last spot. I'm really sorry man, it was a lot of fun working with you. Give me a call if you want."
Yeah!
Yeah! Yeah, we can!
Vic! Where have you been, baby?!
Oh, great! Me too.
Yes!
Oh, hey look nothing happened.
I-I'll call ya.
Joey is a great guy, but we're just... so different! I mean, during your speech he kept laughing at homo erectus!
Hmm, let me see. Let me see. Do you think you could get him to eat a bat?
It's good to see you.
Well, not at all...
Mom, I'll call you later. Yeah. Yes?
Wow umm, tell Sipowicz I'm real sorry for his loss.
Obviously.
Look, I've just pressed a button, triggering a silent alarm. Any minute now, the police will be here!
No way!
Wow! Are you here to make another donation the same day? I don't think that that's ever happened before.
Well, we were in the city shopping, and your mom said you work here, aaand it's true!
I guess I'm saying, I'll try and quit. I kinda like that you worry about me.
So basically this is very easy. You read from the script and try to sell as much toner as you possibly can.
We kinda broke up this morning.
Oooh!
Keep on scooching.
Hey!
Do you want me to check again?
Thanks for everything, I had such a great time.
Hey, you're gettin' better. I'm gonna keep this by the way.
Ah, just some basic dehydrating of a few fruits and vegetables. MAN ALIVE this thing's fantastic!
Okay, so wait, all right, so how does that make things better?
When is Santa coming?
I know. This has been the best year... THIS HAS BEEN THE BEST YEAR OF MY LIFE!
I assume we're talking about the baby now.
How are you?
I found it. Finders keepers, losers weepers.
I see, and Dr. Biely?
I think I might need one more cup of coffee.
There's something I never told you Amber. I'm actually your half- brother.
What's up?
Philadelphia.
Bodington's! Woohoo!
Please.
Yes, I see that here. Unfortunately we can't guarantee a private room and currently they're all unavailable.
Oh that's great!
I thought you came to say you were sick.
No. Because I know how to write men that women fall in love with. Believe me, I cannot sell a Paolo. People will not turn three hundred twenty-five pages for a Paolo. C'mon, the guy's a secondary character, a, y'know, complication you eventually kill off.
Umm, that was really great, but I-I gotta take-off actually.
So you really think those newspapers are just jealous of me?
Right, and...
Well, Telia Shire suddenly became available.
Okay, he sees us. Now don't move. Don't look at him.
Well, I think you're better off without him. Oh honey, I know he's your daddy but, but to me he's still the irresponsible creep who knocked up your mom and stole her Gremlin.
Oh, that's real pretty. Wait a minute, don't I get to see the bedroom?
You're telling me this couch was delivered to you like this?!
We were surprise that we weren't invited.
Goodbye Geller.
So, I think you're ready to sell toner, do you have any last questions?
Huh. Well, I'm supposed to be working at the restaurant tonight. I'm supposed to be working right now, so who cares.
All right, he's coming. He's coming!
Oh-no.
beside meeeee-eeee-ee. .
Any time you're ready, Joey.
Uh, I'm a little embarrassed about calling you a hottie on my evaluation...
You can forget about Emily, she's not with us.
You know, my brother and his boyfriend have been trying to adopt for three years. What agency did you two go through?
Um.. we should really be sitting for this.
I'll see you.
So do I.
Well um, I was in ah Mrs. Knight's ah, I mean Alice, sorry, Alice, I always do that. I was in her ah, Home Ec class.
Wow. Y'know we're back where we were. Honey, I would love to do all that, but nothing's changed.
Sure who are you?
You think so? I've always kinda hated it.
Hi.
Hey, Monica!
Chandler?
Uhh, yeah.
I think I need a drink.
Your loyal loving boyfriend Ross..... Ross!
Well ah, what can you swing?
I know, we did it!! Hey, that was incredible, huh?!
Oh well that's what I thought about my first husband, now I'm lucky if my kid gets to spend the weekend with her father and the twins and little Ms. New Boobs.
Yay!!
We're ok.
Excuse me... This hospital is for people!
I'll take a look at him.
Earl Grey?
My God! Aren't you freezing?
Wow! You look like... like my mom.
Sorry, there's just more room out here.
Yeah, it was my first date since the uh, since the divorce.
I was thinking of doing it a little shorter, you know, like Andie McDowell's new haircut?
One ticket to Yemen?
Well I mean, you're American to start with. You don't even have rugby here.
Why aren't you at home in bed?
The Velveteen Rabbit. I kinda have the feeling you had something to do with it.
I think you should talk to Ross about all this.
Oh, yeah!
I know! I know! And then you lose your apartment! And then you lose your job! And then your ex-wife gets married so fast! And now the coffee-ahh!! Ross, we need to talk.
No no no no, it's potpourri. You're supposed to smell it.
Bona sera.
Oh hello, Ross.
C'mon, this is us.
So, eight days late huh?
Well, sure, that too.
That's my monkey. That's Patti, Patti the monkey.
What was all that about?
Uhh...Shall I go on?
Well, I should hope not. Ross knows better than that by now.
Well, I'm still sorry. Is he here?
No but... You don't want to get married either right?
Uh-huh! I think it's time to kick you in the nuts and see which is worse!
That's right, The I Hate Rachel Green Club!
Why are you yelling?
So what about us? Everything we feel for each other.
All right, I need a clamp, sterile towel, and channel 31.
I wanted to say how much I enjoyed your class.
Actually, he is getting closer on the talking thing. He can't quite say mama yet, but once he said yumen.
Christie Turlington, Kate Moss...
No. No, haven't seen a monkey. Do you know anything about fixing radiators?
No! Why?
No-no-no, the-the puppy's yours.
This is a great place. How long have you lived here?
Hey, Rach!
It is nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Franzblau. I'm your roommate's... brother's... ex-wife's obstetrician.
Okay.
Word on the street - well, when I say street, I mean those little pretend streets they have here at the zoo.
Okay. So I'll come by in a couple hours and pick you up?
We're both teachers.
Oh yeah yeah, thank God you were here to oversee all the kissing!
Hi!
Are you looking to meet somebody?
Hi Ralph.
You wouldn't return my calls, you sent back my letters....
No I won't!
Hey!
It's a curling iron.
Ohhh, man!!
Remember the class play? You, you pulled up my skirt and the entire auditorium saw my underpants.
Alright people, now everyone grab a partner.
How do you know Frank?
Why can't you get a girlfriend your own age?
Aw, no problem dude. Y'know we got to look out for each other. We're the same, you and me.
May I have the rings? Emily, place this ring on Ross's finger as a symbol of your bond everlasting. Ross, place this ring in Emily's hand as a symbol of the love that encircles you forever.
Thanks. Hey, listen, would you like to go to a movie sometime or something?
I guess the last time we really hung out was when our parents rented that beach house together.
All right.
Stop!
How's my Bing-a-ling?
Ah Monica, my star student.
Oh my God!
"Hello. Th-this is the pigeon from the balcony calling to apologise" "I sh.. I shouldn't have knocked the tickets out of the pretty lady's hand. It-it was all my fault. Not hers. Bye. Coo."
This does.
Bing! Ho! And the Bing-ette!
Sure! Monica, I can't get over how great you look! You look stunning!
Sweetheart, just gimme- gimme another chance, okay, we'll start all over again. We'll go back to Aruba.
If this is your idea of sexy talk?
Alright, that sounds like a two person job.
Thank you very much.
We started saving again when you were dating Richard and then that went to hell, so we redid the kitchen.
What'd I get?
Looks like that might come any minute.
Why aren't you moving your feet?
You must be a little uncomfortable.
After a while it's like, shut your mouth, you know?
Hey! What the hell are you doing?!
Come on! You're just titling! Her legs are fine!
What?
Okay ahh, well, just ahh, follow my lead.
Yeah.
What is this? Who put a twenty down here? Huh?
No, actually, um, we talked about Helen Willick-Bunch.
Oh great! Is it vegetarian, 'cause Susan doesn't eat meat.
What?
Okay, but I get to hop on after her.
Now listen, not that you guys could stop me or anything cause you know you'd be dead. I was thinking about changing her name. I'm just not really a big fan of Emily.
Oh, alright.
I am?!
I thought you knew I was looking at you.
What.
Well I'm not gonna stop until I'm the Ultimate Fighting Champion.
No shouting, but we still need a name for this little guy.
Awesome!
Hey, what are you doing here?
Now Gene I must remind you, you need all six of these to stay in the game, all right? Describe for Joey things you find in your refrigerator.
How about I order everyone the Moroccan chicken?
Hi.
And we'll need you and Rachel to testify before a judge.
Come on! Speech!
-hard quality. And uh, while Daryl Hannah is beautiful in a conventional way, you are luminous with a kind of a delicate grace. Then, uh, that-that-that's when you started yelling.
Oh, no, please, I spent most of mid-morning trying to stand up. Now uh, what can I do for you, my dear?
Only if you'll be Phoebe Buffay.
Well uh if you must know I'm a widower.
What, you hired the same band I can't use the same speech. Thank you, thank you very much. Anyway, I wish you both a wonderful life together. And Rachel...
Coffee.
I'll be back in a minute.
Why don't we take it for a spin?
Aaawwwwww!!
Hey. Ursula said she left her purse.
Okay, I'll see you in our room.
No.
You're pretty much running that risk either way.
Is your finger caught in that chair?
Hey, buddy! Are you familiar with Section 11-B of the Health Code that requires all refuse material out the back exit?
Phoebe? The lady who sells toner?
Well uh, I don't have a gift because I wasn't invited until the last minute, but thank you so much for bringing that to everyone's attention.
Here we go!
Totally! Wow! Would you excuse me for a sec?
But, you got up!
What're you gonna do, suck the door open?
Yeah, well, it would've been, but uh, my parents just moved here.
Okay uh, however...
I wish I could talk to her.
I got an extra one. You want this?
Oh, sorry.
No it's not too soon, I had lunch at a eleven.
Yeah. Well maybe you have heard about the Rent Stabilization Act of 1968!
Not so good, Simmons and I gave him a wedgie.
One more thing... There... might be a picture of Precious on my coffee table.
Tartlets. Tartlets. Tartlets. The word has lost all meaning.
Of course, course one of 'em's Ma. What's the matter with you.
He... he's gonna propose?
Yeah - not such a problem with rats. No, they're more of a "love the one you're with" kind of animals.
Monica and Rachel's apartment. Err yeh, aayah, yeh, just one second... ..ah, Rachel, it's your dad.
All right, let's start with some basics. Can anybody tell me what the difference between upstage and downstage is?
Bye... Bye dear.
I'm not supposed to drink coffee, it makes me gassy.
I just wanted to come by and thank you for not laughing in my face yesterday. And I noticed there aren't any plants in your office so I wanted to bring you your first... There is a plant in your office.
I think his butt would like to get this shot before lunch. Once again, rolling... water working... and action....and cut. What was that?
Excuse me... .
Thank you.
Um-hmm.
But... Well now, now's a different time for me.
Hi! I brought you back a macaroon!
Thanks.....
Hi Rachel.
Totally, I love them! And, maybe you could finish telling me about all the different kinds of sand.
Hey Rachel!
Oh no! You get up there and do that again exactly like that!
Good for you.
What?!
I can dial 9-1-1 at the touch of a button, y'know. Now, go away!
That's great!
She-she wasn't ready for a serious commitment.
Who?
I know what you're thinking Judy, the resemblance is uncanny!
Me and Ross.
You're welcome. I'm sorry. Did I hurt you?
Joey? Do you want me to put it all in your room?
Okay.
Well, I just wanted to see where you lived. Now, give me the tour.
No.
Hey!
I just, I want you to know I didn't used to be like this. Before I meet your sister I was like this normal guy who sold beepers and cellular phones.
Oh and your agent said you were okay with the nudity.
Thanks.
I won! That was my quarter!
You're not Rachel.
Are you all right?
Things change, roll with em.
Hi!
Oh.. Never mind. Who are you?
Look, I gotta go. I'm on call tonight. See you Saturday.
No-no that's a man's shirt.
I'm ready!
Charlie! My God, you look absolutely stunning!
Well if you like, we can include your names in our newsletter.
Yeah?
Okay.
Just aim for the bump.
Ohh that's so sweet!
It's the key to my Porsche. Well, the key to your Porsche.
So how do you kids like your coffee?
Well, you kids thank Dr. Burke for the ride?
Alrighty. From the top.
Here, Ross, take our picture. Smile! You're on Janice Camera!
I have a wonderful idea. You should take Rachel to the prom.
Checking to see if it's even.
Yeah. I have to sleep, have to, on this side of the bed.
Hi!
Hi.
Ross!
Screw it! I'm having one.
I just want to say that Ross is a wonderful young man.
G'night.
It's gonna be ok, just remember, we're doing this for Jordie. Just keep focusing on Jordie.
Bye.
Oh hey! Here they are!
It really was. Oh, c'mere, sweetheart. Y'know, I think it might be time for you to start using night cream.
Yeah, I'm riding the alimony pony.
Look, if I wanna see Phoebe and she wants to see...
You think so too?
You were saying?
Oh my God!!
Hi, how's it goin?
Wow! They're both really strong.
No!
Happy birthday sweetie.
Okay, ah, see ya Pheebs.
Oh really? Well, then you'd better tell his other wife, 'cause she called three times asking where he is.
Then I made the mistake of turning off the TV, I never got it back again. And I'm sad.
Yeah!
I invested in this night-club and it's opening tonight, would you like to come?
Hey!!
Yeah, you still have feelings for me. And-and to be honest, I-I still have feelings for you. And I wish that we can work it out Ross, but we can't. It's too complicated with you and Rachel and the baby, I-I just... It just wasn't meant to be.
What are you doing here?!
You guys tell them you were married?
Yeah, ummm, I don't like the hat that much.
Knicks fans, please turn your attention to the big screen on the score board. Someone has a special question to ask.
So what do you want?
Look at this.
Oh okay. But y'know what? Be careful. Because a guy was helping me before had to leave because he hurt his back.
All right, whenever you're ready.
You guys live around here too?
Oh, they're working on this week, it's a total mess. But uh, I'm staying at my parents' house, we could go there.
I thought so many times about calling him and asking him out. I guess I really missed my chance.
1 minute 50 seconds.
How do you spell that? So we can get it right.
Now Ross, repeat after me. I Ross...
Oh, so did I.
So you're asking us to refund your donation to the children?
I'll let you two guys get acquainted, huh?
Hey! Hey!
You'll never believe what just happened, Ross just totally blew me off and he didn't even tell me why!
Hey, it's everybody.
Monica.
It's not that kind of anniversary.
You're ready to play?
So, it's great to see ya.
Hey!
Seriously, your dad doesn't like pranks.
I can't until I'm the ultimate fighter. I will do it. I'm telling you, the day will come when children will argue over who will win a fight, me or Superman. Now, I'm not saying I could beat Superman, but y'know, kids are stupid.
I'm fine. No, I'm not alone... I don't know, some guy.
Hi.
Ross umm, there's something that I've got to tell you, there's-there's someone else.
I'm not interested.
You do?
Folks, has this ever happened to you. You go to the refrigerator to get a nice glass of milk, and these darn cartons are so flingin'-flangin' hard to open.
That's cool. Cool.
Oh, hey, man I know, doesn't matter how much we love 'em, monogamy is too cruel a rule.
Y'know you could totally sell this. It'd be perfect for like umm, a kitty litter campaign.
Yeah, I'm her date.
What do you know about love?
Oh wow, you look great! Glad you could make it.
It's a Speedo.
How do I and Joey know each other? Wow, if I had a nickel for every time somebody has asked me that.
Well they said I should bring someone. Do you wanna be my dance partner?
Rachel?
Could you tell Jasmine that I won't make it to yoga class today?
Glad to be of help. Matches.
She.
You're saying, my wife is in you?
Uhm... uhm... Goodbye... Uh... Schto ya ztez vigul... ui...
Okay, uh well, let's try one. Whenever you guys are ready.
Sure.
Oh, no. But it's just a two hour ferry ride to Nova Scotia.
You have not changed!
Yeah.
Hi.
Did you bring me any presents, Santa?
Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut...
We've come for her things.
Well, the guy's worked here for 25 years.
Worth a shot, huh?
They have a game room downstairs! Ping pong and stuff.
You don't think they'll judge and ridicule me?
Come in, I'm so glad you're here.
Hey.
Hi, pig!
Yeah, that's pretty much what I had in mind.
Well, it's your mother's bridge night so I thought that I would come into the city for a little Monicuddle. Since when did you start smoking cigars?
Hey.
Mississippi? I said count to five'!
Oh, excellent.
One uh, vegetarian pizza. That's $12.15.
I've had a really good time tonight.
Well, you just asked if I wanted to go to bed with you tonight.
Cigarette's don't control you. You are a strong, confident woman, who does not need to smoke.
Dude!
Smelly Cat, Smelly Cat, what are they feeding you? Smelly Cat, Smelly Cat, it's not your fault.
No way!
Yeah, we met in college. I mean, high school.
Yeah, but y'know, I think the reason we're not getting that spin right is because my apartment's too small.
Monica! Chandler! I'm really-really sorry about tonight. I don't know if Joey told you; I just couldn't get out of going to this play. I'm sorry. Have a great time.
Hang on.
N.Y.P.D!!
No you answer it and take pledges.
This is nice.
You have a very impressive resume, Ms. Green. I especially like what I see here about implementing a new filing system.
Oh that's interesting? Because I checked and only one keycard was used to access the copy machine yesterday during lunch and that keycard belonged to you, Rachel.
Do I know you?
There is no father.
Come on!
Shut up!
Here's my binoculars.
You are an idiot. .
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Wait-wait!
I moved back here a couple of months ago.
Oh.... my.... God.
Were you following me?
Yeah, she was my best teacher.
N-no... uhm... did I buy a falafel from you yesterday?
Oh hey, Ross. Umm, see, I was thinking maybe you two could switch apartments because Phoebe's more our kind of people. Something to think about.
It's about your monkey. It's alive.
Ok, then I want to hear you say it, I, I want to hear you say you want me out.
Look, it's like I told you, there's nothing I can do. You signed for it, Monica Velula Geller.
Neither of us like Ross!
And look where they're sitting.
Honey I made a reservation at China Garden, is that okay?
Do I know why we're rushing?
Anything?
Oh, it looks great!
Okay, yeah. I mean... If that's, if that's really what you want, okay.
So, why do you let her go to a chiropractor for?
Pecan sandy, just made em.
Well yeah, it usually, it takes two people to...
It looked like we were gonna lose her this morning, but she's a tough old bird.
Ok. Very good. Have a seat right over here Mr. Bing and Sonia will be right with you.
Nancy and I were talking about the fall collection.
See, this is just the kind of thing I was talking about.
I own this store.
Alright, let me just get my coat.
Cleveland.
He would like to kiss you.
No, I didn't.
So, tell me about it.
1...2...3!
Yeah! Yeah, sort of. I'm sorry.
No.
Ooohhh.
You look very pretty today.
No, you didn't. The only thing that freaked me out was you saying that nothing could ever happen between us.
I just wish Nana were alive to hear Ross's toast.
But...
Allright!
Ohh!
Good to see you, too.
Oh, that's Frank Jr. Jr. pulling the tampons out of the lady's purse. And that's Chandler climbing on Chandler, and that's Leslie throwing bagels at him.
I understand, separation is hard. One time I was about to leave Ross to go to the beauty parlor and he got so upset, he took off all his clothes, tucked his ??? between his legs and cried out: "Mommy, I'm a girl, take me with you."
Oh, that does sound. . .Ahh.
So you guys want me to take this back?
No, that's not it. So, you're a soap actor? Well this must be pretty exciting for you to be in a real play, hmm?
No. No. No. Okay, now, see, I wanna name the girl baby Leslie, and Frank wants to name one of the boy babies Frank JR. JR.
We took a road trip to Las Vegas man.
I thought it was... quite tasty.
Well, you'll have to wait your turn.
Uh, we've just gotten a call from Rachel, and she told us what Ross did. It's pretty appalling, and Ross, if you're listening, I don't wanna play your song anymore. Why don't we devote our time to a couple that stands a chance? Avery, Michelle's sorry she hit you with her car and she hopes you two will work it out.
...I may have only been in therapy for three weeks now dear but...
Excuse me?
It ain't no thing, I'm wild too.
After what he just said, you're paying for the whole bloody lot.
Now you'll be heading a whole division, so you'll have a lot of duties.
Aaaahhhhhhh.
Monica told you I was cuter that this, didn't she?
Last I heard, he was a pharmacist somewhere upstate.
You know what else? He's unbelievable in bed.
Christmas eve.
I don't think so.
Don't you talk to my husband like that you stupid bastard!
Not to me.
What-what's going on?!
Uhh, Rachel, my parents...
Clever. So how are you?
Ross, what're you doing.
Game, point!
I'm not sure yet. Why didn't you just tell me about all this?
So what. I say, punch him.
Right, okay, the one that lives in Montuak, umm-hmm.
Oh, wait a second! I didn't say I wasn't free!
She's checking the coats. Joey, I'm gonna go wash the cab smell off my hands. Will you get me a white Zinfandel, and a glass of red for Janice.
Oh yeah? Well maybe you and I should take a walk through a bad neighborhood.
Wh-what's that?
No, it's, it's more of a fifth date kinda revelation.
Do you like to party?
Hi Ross.
Yeah, yeah. Hey, thanks for doing that.
Yay!
Nooo. And there's really no reason he should find out, so ah let's not make a big deal about it, okay?
Oh, sorry!
Well, guess who my dad's making partner in his firm?
Oh no-no, I-I had my eyes closed so I could concentrate and y'know take it all in.
Good morning. Drake, it's your brother Stryker. Can you hear me?
Shh! No! Joe Hill!
Maybe I'll sign for it. Tear it open. Pull out the packing material...
No thanks.
How did you know they were in my bottom drawer?
Okay.
Well, I will, because I won't be playing with you.
Good luck, babe.
PHD.
Take thee Ross...
What if you put them here.
Why can't you ever be supportive?
It's Erica.
Oh, thank you. You're welcome.
Wow!
Still no smile?
Oh, yeah. I love Jennifer Van Murray's work. She's so brilliantly incisive when it comes to deconstructing the psyche of the American middle class.
Hey. They're just trying to decide somehting.
Oh crap!
Yeah. Monica, I want you there in the front row when I win. I want you close enough to smell the blood. What do you think?
Did not, she did not wink at you....
So, how did you propose?
Why won't you take our picture?
Seriously?
We're back on.
Like what?
Uh, Phoebe, I don't think your mom would want you to see what's about to happen.
I'm okay. I gotta go down to the police station and look at mug shots.
No kiddin,' that's the exact same drink I made myself right after I shot my husband.
Okay, that's great, but can we make it smaller? Can we make it fit on the head of a pin? I love when we make things fit on the head of a pin.
Oy. Look, I've been through a divorce, trust me you're gonna be fine. You just can't see it now because you haven't had any closure.
Uh, may I help you?
Well, I've... I've been blessed with a... a lot of great roles.
I missed this.
The new girl's good.
Whenever you're ready.
Hi.

Then why did it have the word eternity in it?
Hey you're in our seats.
Yeah.
And, by the way, I really enjoyed your paper on the connection between geographic isolation and rapid mutagenesis.
Hi! Gavin! Please to meet you. It was my idea to stand there.
No.
Joey! It's Estelle! Great news, I was able to get you and one guest tickets to your premiere.
Hi! Hi. I think I left my keys here somewhere.
Come on!
Congratulations! Ohh, that's great!
Okay, thank you. It's the Italian Hand-Licker, isn't it.
I quit!
What's wrong?
I like your necklace.
Okay, here he comes. What is he doing? What the hell is he doing?!
Suddenly, I very aware that I'm naked.
No, we just went out.
This one time I had my knee up on the sink and your mother, she was.
What's up? You're voice sounded all squeaky on the phone.
OH...MY...GAWD!!!!
I do Raquel.
Oh no-no-no-no, being adored. I'm used to it, don't worry about it.
You remember her Michael, she's lovely and... well behaved and... single.
You wanted to see me?
Well, if you're one of Ross's best friends, why aren't you here?
You would think.
What are you talking about?
Eeeee!
How could you know. Why wouldn't you punch me in the stomach?
You did it twice?
All right Miss Green, everything looks fine... Yep, I think we're starting to see some real progress here.
Now get on out of here, you!
excuse me?
Ahh, that's what your Grandmother's hands looked like when we found her.
What did I tell you about talking to your friends while you're working?
Good morning!
No. No! You're doing great! Don't you give up! That's why we didn't tell you and we're not gonna drag you down with us.
Hi, one, uh, mushroom, green pepper and onion?
Umm, look I-I-I got a confession to make...
Oh my God!
Okay, but isn't sex better when it's with one person that you really, really care about.
Definitely.
What's it look like?
Hey, wait a second! So wait, what precinct are you with?
That's not the hard part honey! The hard part is what comes next, I mean aren't you worried about the results?
Ow!
I can't believe you really walk alone here! I mean, you hear such stories about New York.
Stop it!
So we can go out again?
Ahh, I'd throw another thousand on that.
Oh, blimey, I still can't believe you've got an earring!
I-I am Kristen.
What's the matter? You never saw a 50 year old stripper cry before?
Oh, I'm sorry.
Icky? You're actually gonna throw this away because it's icky?
Is something wrong?
Why don't you get in the hot tub and I'll meet you there.
You bet I am! And to answer your earlier question, we're straight-up gangster rap.
Oh, all right, fine, fine, fine.
Mushroom. Smile. They won't all be like this. Some women might even stay through dinner. Sorry, that's not funny
Y'know, thanks for trying to cheer me up, but I'm not gonna date some random guy from your work.
Oh, no-no-no, that's not rude! It's perfectly in keeping with a trip that I've already been run down by one of your wiener carts, and been strip-searched at John F. Kennedy Airport, apparently to you people, I look like someone who's got a balloon full of cocaine stuffed up their bum.
So why did you plan a party at the same time?
We have it. Only now, we call it the beach house.
I'm sorry... I'm sorry, God, I am so sorry, I'm an idiot, I was weak, I couldn't help myself! Whatever I did, I only did because I love you so much!
Oh! Someone's a little cranky today cuz they have to do it in a cup! Oh! They gave you the kiddy size .
Do you not want to be seen with me?
No actually umm, I think that they're umm, gas.
What?
Oh yes there is!
What? Are you married? 'Cause that's okay.
Come on, let's have some fun. Huh? What do you want to do today?
OK, look, this isn't the first time somebody's said something to me about this, but, I don't know... I always made excuses about it, like... uhhh... 'I'm just a social drinker,' or, 'C'mon, it's Flag Day.'
Oh, he's fine. He's fine. It's just that us getting along is difficult for him, because he doesn't like me.
Ohh. Hi!
Hey. Hey where's the baby?
Who are you?!
Umm, no. See I already thought she was dead so I kinda made my peace with it. Plus, I'm going to a concert tomorrow. So... I'd invite you, but umm, I only have two tickets left.
What?!
Good choice.
Give me the dice.
Here are the audition scenes.
Hey.
Please, make yourself comfortable and I will back in a moment with Erica.
Hello Rachel, you uh, got a minute?
What?!
Uh, well... Joey and I broke up.
Oh my. We're gonna need to take you straight to the delivery room.
Of course we'll help! Yeah! We'll be here!
Oh! Wow! Hey!
Uh-oh.
Hey Joe does it have meatballs on it?
All right, I'm leaving! Because I'm not going to spend one more day with someone whose out to sabotage my every move. That's you Rachel!
I love you too!
I'd love to!
I dunno, uh... you just have a-a...
That's the best one! Oh my God, thank you so much!
Hey! Hey, Bananaman!
No, the place is not open 'till Tuesday. Am I not saying it right.
You can't.
That's my job!
Ta-daaa!
Yeah. Yeah, excellent.
Really?!
Have a seat through the glass doors.
Professor Geller?
Oh, I'm gonna kick Chip's ass.
Which one? Was it bald or was it tall?
Spiteful?!
W-w-w-wait! Why?!
"I-I-I can't tell you somethin' I don't know."
Uh yes, I think I vaguely recall it.
It's white!
I wasn't ready for it.
Me go out with Ross?! No! God no! What would make you think that?
Well, her memory is pretty much gone.
Uh-huh.
Santa has reindeers that can fly!
What's going on?
You really think this man is speaking French?
Really?! Well, it's just like everyone else's apartment. It's got rooms, walls, and ceilings.
And I need to flip the light switch on and off 17 times before I leave a room or my family will die.
I want you to move in with me.
What?
Is there, anything in this record that is actually true?
I'm next!
Lima.
Wow, love your new nose!
Did you know my husband has glasses just like that?
Hockey! Hockey! Hockey.
Are you guys ready?
All right. Keep pushing! Come on!
And first, I have to see the MET!
Okay...
Oh also, you might be interested to know that I have a Ph.D.
I can hear you through the ceiling. My cats cant sleep.
Okay, I don't need any toner because I'm going to kill myself.
Yeah well, thanks for bringing back what's left of him.
Ah, good to meet you. Robert.
I like Ross.
What?
Um, excuse me.
Hi honey, I've got a cab waiting.
You used to be my babysitter.
What are these, stitches?
Ooh...
Yes, yes, do go on.
Well, apparently I'm willing to offer her things that you are not.
Monica.
Oh! That feels sooo good!
You might wanna get back in there.
Jack, give me that. Talk to your son.
Yo, Chloe, do you have a quarter for the condom machine?
Here I am!
I'll never forget you Hans.
Take thee Ross...
Really?!
Hi, welcome home!
Uh, can we have three chocolate mousses to go please?
I am Mike.
Dad!!
Did you bring the toe?
Yeah, I just gotta run to the bathroom.
You go get that animal outta here.
I believed you were saving this seat for someone.
Um-hmm.
A joke they would appreciate?
Forget it Joey. I'm with Bob now.
Hey-hey! Bing? Was that Bob from six you were just talking too?
Y!
Oh I-I remember you.
Oh, sorry, I didn't realize.
Yeah...
Yeah! Right!
Great. Great! Just give me a sec to change film.
Isn't!
It's not here.
Don't worry son, we'll just attach it and-
Yeah, so we just thought we'd stop by and let you know there's still no pressure.
Oh sure, every Sunday night I'm telling myself I'm quitting but every Monday morning it's like
Oh, isn't Lori a doll?
She was. Carbs found her... See, this is what I wanted. Two sisters, talking about real stuff.
Oh yeah, aww!
But they're not here yet!
Is it serious?
We will.
Well, Ross and I were in grad school together.
Well, say no more. Y'know it takes guts to bring this up. Bing! You're okay.
Rachel?
Here, sweetie, here. I took these when I had my golfing accident.
I have a question I was kinda gonna ask her myself.
Well, you know, there's no one way really, it's just, you know, whatever it takes so that you can finally say to him, "I'm over you."
Rachel Green's office.
You hear a key in the hole and you jump like a young bronco coming out of a chute for the first time. I used to be arodeo clown.
Yeah, thank you Rachel, you are soo cool.
So.
Omm-pah, omm-pah, omm-pah.
What's going on?
Now, let me explain how this works. You go into the booth, and...
Okay, I hear you loud and clear. Bob will stay put.
Aww!
It seems your daughter and Richard are something of an item.
Yay!
Sir? Sir? Excuse me, sir? Uh... I have a message for you.
Well, you've got a little scratch on your cornea, your gonna have to wear a patch for a couple of days.
Yeah. Oh.
I'm sorry, uh... I just wish I could make her forget about Mike already, you know... Why did Phoebe and Mike break up?
And when you have a second later, I wanna show you why we don't just trap spiders under coffee mugs and leave them there.
So, tell me a little bit about yourself.
They have parasites?
He is very sweet. Plus he's hot!
Absolutely.
Hey!
I love you sweetheart.
Well, no, maybe-maybe it wasn't perfect, but y'know it was pretty cool, y'know, 'cause we had all those great talks y'know.
Diet Coke.
Rachel, you have life growing inside you. Is there anything in this world more miraculous than-Oh a picture of a dog! Whose is this?
Sorry.
Here you go.
There she is. And over there, that's the other one. This is Mr. Buddy Boyle, Mr. Heckles' attorney. He'd like to talk to you.
Thanks... uh... I'm so sorry about Ross, it's...
Why don't you fill out this address card.
Dr. Burke will see you know.
Here we go, one Hazelnut Latte.
Okay. Have you started having contractions?
Yes it does.
Get out!
Because we can remember them.
...should be playing with the star of "General Hospital" Leslie Charleson. Welcome everybody. Good luck to all of you. Let's play Pyramid. All right? Now... we flipped a coin before the show, Gene, you won the toss, so you're gonna start. Which category would you like?
Okay!
I want to talk to you about your review.
I don't know. Are they Greek Orthodox?
Gotcha!!
The bedroom. Well it's pretty much your typical... bedroom.
No. The one in Atlantic City, Dad loves the slots. He says he's gonna double the college money my Grandma left me.
Oh well, um, your, your laundry just smelled so good, that I thought I'd curl up in it. Is that all right?
Oh believe me, I-I-I've been there. I had to sort mannequin heads at that Mannequins Plus.
Joey, bravo!
You really need the bassinet?
You're not gonna speed anymore right?
Let me tell you a story. When I set out to create Moss 865, do you think it just happened overnight? No. There was Moss 1, that burnt down my Dad's garage, there was Moss 2 that would only schedule appointments in January, and 862 others that I learned from, just like I learned from this fight, never to let a guy stand on my neck.
Are you going to eat that bread?
Uhh, yeah, I think I'm going to take-off too.
Why? Why?! What's wrong with me?!
Your thinking about my leg aren't you?
Oh, I gotta go.
Oh, it was okay. I went to a movie with my cousin and then out for dinner. We went to this place that had... Ooh... Hoo... ooh... Anyway, they had these really amazing cheeseburgers.
Hey! I missed you.
Joey...
Boutros Boutros Gali.
Oh that explains all the women's underwear.
Oooh, that sounded like a bad one.
What is it sweetie?
Well. Your mom didn't tell us about the blobbies.
Okay, thanks. I'll give you a call later tonight.
Really stupid. And I don't even know how it happened. I'm sorry, honey, I promise it will never happen again. Are we okay now?
Sure.
Hey, dinosaur guy, look at you, so sad. Come dance.
Joe, I tried to wait until I was 25 like you did!
Yo!!
Ah, Susan will be so pleased.
Can he handle the stick?
Excuse me?
Excuse me, sir, where are you going?
Show me in the table.
Sometimes I think that.. Oh, no, no, no, I can't say it, it's too horrible. No.
No! Sam Waterston!
How did you know we were here?
Eh, he said, thank you very much, he thinks you look very pretty tonight, your hair, golden like the sun. So you're a chef?
So? Come on! Explain yourself Geller! First you get my Rachel pregnant!
Thank you, I think so too.
It's the Gellers!
You have pets!
Oh, why would he do this? I mean, what's wrong with me?
Yeah, but it wasn't much fun dropping it off at the dry cleaners in the skirt. So I need everything down to underwear, so if you're willing, I'm all yours.
The one with "Heston" on it.
Sorry.
...Hey! You're in a play! I didn't know you could dance! You had a beard!
Why not? You hate park views and high ceilings? C'mon I'll show you the kitchen.
Thanks for your help.
That guy has been waiting for his coffee for ten minutes! He's complained about you three times!
Oh, Jack look, there's that house paint commercial that cracks you up.
October 25th.
It's just her water breaking. Calm down, will you?
Ross, I have been a divorce attorney for 23 years and never had I so much business from one client. Why don't you tell me what happened.
Umm, no. Thanks, but I'll give these to Betty. So I read your evaluation of Tag, or to use his full name, Tag Sweetcheeks Jones. Is something going on with you two?
Yeah.
I um, was sorta thinking about maybe...
Is this yours?
I'll see you tomorrow.
A part of him did yes.
Ohh, Joey has the nicest friends!
I hope you can find some way to be happy for me. And I hope you'll still be my maid of honor...?
Bye!
Oh, come on!
Hey!
Oh! Um... Well... I'm getting married.
I can't believe you thought that you were going to video tape us having sex on the first date!
Oh, oh, I thought we were just talking.
Oh no-no-no-no sweetheart, you stay put. I'll let myself out. It's like I'm not here, which I almost wasn't.
You feel that too? Oh, I thought that was just me!
I'm so happy that you're here.
O-Okay!
Your mom called me. So is this her?
Yeah, not really. Babies are dull.
I'm sorry, all our first class seats are taken. That couple got the last two.
And cut. Hey, Butt Guy, what the hell are you doing?
There's a third guy?
I'll be there, and who knows, if things go well, maybe this time I'll get to see your underwear.
Phoebe, come on!
Terrific! Well uh, there's one more thing. Uhh, uh it's really important to the director that everything in this movie is authentic. Yeah and so in your love scene with Sarah she talks about how she's never seen a naked man who wasn't Jewish. So...
Oh. God, crazy Chandler. He spun me...off...the...bed!
Your territory, huh?
Hi!
Actually, I don't think we have to.
Well, we did a little more than that.
Really?
Ok.
Oh.
...in love with you.
Well, I don't know. I mean it's not like we don't have anything in common. I mean I like uh, pizza.
Hi!
Colorado.
Trick or treat!
Oh yeah!
Take as long as you want. Just let me know when you're through.
Thank you.
I do like my hair.
Fabulous.
The Waltham Residence.
oh I thought you said Hi.
Oh Alessandro's! I love that place!
No-no ah, everything's okay. Everybody's healthy there's 30 fingers and 30 toes.
Ooh, boy. You should warn people there's no elevator! I should not have had that Mexican food for lunch.
No! What are you going to do? Make me?
Absolutely. Okay, first we'll start with a little club soda and salt, and then if that doesn't work we can go back to...
I love you Drake.
Makes up most of his lines. Son-of-a-. Yeah, well, write this jerkweed.
Can't wait.
Kinda stepped on the toes of what I was going to say.
I do have feelings for you.
Bob is great. He's smart, he's sophisticated, and he has a real job. You, you go on three auditions a month and you call yourself an actor, but Bob...
Yeah I.. I think so. It's nice to meet you Emma.
Well, that could take a while.
So uh, you wanna go to Marquel's?
Oh, thank god, it's not Mitzi. It's just a rat.
Oh, ow! Did Joey tell you to say that? You guys, are too much!
Ah-ah-ah, you know what that is?
Oh, I used to work with Frannie.
Do you ah, currently own a set of encyclopedias?
What, you don't think I know that?
Would you like my tin-foil hat?
Our little boy is getting married.
Is this guy, uhh, an old boyfriend?
It says here that the knife went right through your shoe.
Yeah, it's-it's my only weird thing, I swear. And I-I-I would've told you about it, but I didn't know they would be here.
Twenty-one hours, you're a hero.
Im gonna wait till after we order. Its her, right.
Yeah, it's not. But I'm rich and thin.
Oh, 'scuse me. So Ross, uh, how's the wife? Off there too, uh? Uh, Chandler, quick, say something funny!
I have to get off this plane, okay? Her friend has a feeling something's wrong with the left Philange.
Look at that face! Just like when you were in high school! If I didn't know better I'd say you were a cheerleader in trouble. Come on, let's get some tea.
Well, you know your insurance will cover that.
You bet. Maybe some other time?
Yes?
Hombre?
Oh yeah, but I can stay out as late as I want.
Thanks.
Hi, this is Heldi from the Morgan Chase museum. I'm calling for Monica Geller. I want to let her know that there was a cancellation and if she's still interested in having the Bing-Geller wedding at our facility, it is available...
Who?
Hey, so are you sure your ready to go.
Hi.
We started a rumor.
Oh sure. Vince?!
Daryl Hannah was the most beautiful woman that he'd ever seen in his life and I said yeah, I liked her in Splash, a lot, but not so much in- in Wall Street, I thought she had kind of a
What?
Well, I would like to propose a toast to the woman, who in one year from today, become Mrs. Dr. Barry Farber DDS
It's lame, I know. But I'm a goal-oriented person, very eager to learn...
Could you press up too please?
That's a good one.
You know, I... I feel like I've been here before. Are any other couples in the building adopting?
What? Oh!
Poo?
Yeah.
Eeaagh!
Mmm-mm.
Yep, sucks!
These are my night vision goggles. This is the book I pretend to read when I'm watching her in the park. And these are Mad Lips, they're just for fun.
Oh my God, that's just like my name!
Honey, you are in it.
Just keep smiling.
There's no way in hell, I'm paying for it.
Smelly cat, smell-ly cat, it's not your fault.
Who told you that?
Next up is a marching band from Muskogee, OK.
Okay, my trainer, Ho Chi, is teaching me a combination of Gee Koon Doe and Brazilian street fighting, I've even had my own octagon training ring designed.
I'm sorry?
Hey don't take it personal, he's under a lot of pressure, ya know, starring in a movie and all.
Yeah, just, I feel like I'm about a hundred. I thought I was just one of the guys.
I-I think I'm gonna look around a little bit more.
Great! Dad! Thank you so much, I'll be back to pick him up in an hour.
All right. This is the kitchen.
So ah, there was this thing I wanted to talk to you about.
Congratulations you two!
Rachel?
Oh my God!!
Why not?
No, it's only been six years. I just wanted to put a nice memory in your head so you'd know that I wasn't always such a terrible guy. ...Joe. Y'ever been in love?
So, I'm surprised you agreed to have lunch with me.
Yes.
Yeah!
Y'know, I just was finally happy y'know. For the first time in my life! After my Dad left me, and then, and then getting arrested for stealing those birds, and then, and then the whole punctured lung thing! I can, it's still really hard to take deep breaths in cold weather, but with Alice all that stuff kinda went away. And now it's, and now it's gone and I don't know why!
You look strong, why don't I take that and you grab one of the boxes.
Push, push!
Ok, listen, thanks for coming in.
So, okay! So you'll come with me on the Paris trip.
Sharing is good.
Alright. What's the message?
I thought they could...I'll try to get back as soon as I can. I'm sorry.
Why don't you tell her my name?
You expect me to believe.. Hi Ralph.
Why?! Why?! He said he'd call. Why hasn't he called?
A test?!!
They were so ornate and beautiful, I mean look at that!
Yeah, they're fine.
In fact when we were building houses in Uruguay, we were, we were just two towns apart and we never met.
No, he was this creepy guy from high school who had this huge crush on her since like the ninth grade. Ross with a look of wondering how long this is going to go on on his face: Still me.
Hey.
Wow, that's great! So, tell me about the grant!
Hi!
No, that was clenching.
I think it would make me wanna marry you even more.
I'm 33.
Hey, thanks for talking to me.
No I distinctly remember you were dodging her calls and trying to avoid seeing her.
I was not!
Actually they were Nana's.
H-Hi!! And you are...?
I've never seen it!
Boy, I'm glad I wore the big belt today.
Listen, I-I guarantee you keep your job if you can teach me how to talk to women like you do.
He says he was too.
I'll just wait to put your order in.
It went under the table.
Monica, Monica is great.
I'll be okay.
That info-mercial! For the milk carton spout thing! You're-you're-you're the guy that doesn't know how to pour milk!!
No-no, it's ooozing, oozing. Could you pass me the cream? Is there any-Oh, there's the cream.
Uhh, not that I know of.
First of all, it's on your ass.
Just those two!
Poo?!
When's your birthday?
Wait! You forgot your legs!
Way to go, Phoebe!
Kiss me!
We don't need any toner.
It's uh, $12.50.
Well, this isn't how I was hoping how this would end, but I guess I have to appreciate your honesty.
Hi.
Okay, all right. Let's do it. And...Action!
Ross!
Any progress?
So, who's the lucky guy?
Uhm... Ha ha!
Bye-bye.
And in fifth grade I got into a fight. Well, it wasn't really a fight. Richard Darinvel bit me on the nose and, and I feel down. I still have a little scare right here you can see it.
Wow! Somebody wants people to know you have a boyfriend.
Well kinda old, like 30.
You wanna touch it?
What are they like? I've never had one.
Aces!
All right, man!!
...anyway, his name is Allan and we've been going out for three years. He was my first client when I became a party planner. He was planning a party for his girlfriend at the time. Oh well. And he was Theta Beta Pi at Syracuse.
Look, you don't want to fight me.
We can't do that.
And someday soon, I hope to open my own restaurant.
Like in my last job, I met Daniel when he was three weeks old. And I got to watch him grow into this awesome person... When I Left, I Said I'll see you soon... And he said to me: Skdandy... That was his name for me... I'll see you every day... right in...
Come on in.
I've got bad news. The Chinese guy left.
Your license?
But you just said "What's mine is yours"?
Cool!
How cute was that?
Oh no, I am a fabulous mom! I bought my son his first condoms.
Can't hear you!
Look I just thought that...
Ow!-Ow!-Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Y'know, ow!
I'm sorry Chandler, y'know you are such a sweet guy and I, I don't want to hurt you. Oh, I wish there was something I can do to make you feel better.
Nothing at all?
Oh, he's unbelievable. I mean for the first time in three years somebody wants to actually want to talk to me, but do you think he would let me enjoy that, no!! You silly diplomat, why don't you learn some English, Sergei?
Is it true they have beer?
She's supposed to be with you.
That's so exciting.
Uh, I don't have a wife or girlfriend, but I do like to ski.
Chandler!
Y-, y-, you like that show?
I'm sorry Amber. It's just like Brad to have to have the last word.
Hi. Could I have a pack of Newport Lights, please?
Just the last two pages.
No.
Emma, Ross wants you.
Ah Joey. Joey Tribbiani. Listen Joey, I got a problem, I just got a call from my dance captain, he's having a relationship crisis and can't get out of Long Island.
Do you have any tissues?
Absolutely! But you-you would really feel better about me rejecting you if your actor friend can audition for my movie?
It's the basketball playoffs.
Went out with Joey.
In a minute. You-you checked today's Post?
What?!
Break up with Charlie!
Hi, but I'm not here, you haven't met me. I'll make a much better first impression tomorrow when I don't have 20 hours of cab and plane on me.
Hey Chandler, what are you doing here?
No, under these circumstances it has to be an injection, and it has to be now.
Uh, not really. But when it comes to cheese, I'm one of the people who thinks the smellier the better.
I just had the greatest idea! I'm gonna come live with you!
How are you?
I think we have an answer.
Sorry I'm late. Let's get started. So, what did everybody think about Jane Eyre?
I thought you wanted to adopt your cat.
I know! I almost called off my wedding. Oh, who's your band?!
Yeah. Yeah, I'm sorry. I don't . . . I don't really like to talk about it.
Stop saying you're not talented, you're very talented. It's just with the bird dead and all, there's very little act left. Oh, honey, give me a break, will ya? Oooh, ooh, I'll talk to you later.
Yeah, I know. Well... this is probably a stupid question, seeing that you look like that, but do you have some place that you need to be right now?
I'm, I'm still me.
Okay, you got your free food! You ruined everyone's fun! Don't you think it's time you went home?!
We've lost visual contact with the suspect.
Right, why do you keep saying that?
Yeah.
Sure, sure. Come on... ...in...
Oh, I didn't, I didn't know that.
Uh no, I have to go in a few hours. I have to be on the red-eye. Well listen, y'know, next time you're in Minsk umm...
I can't imagine why.
Got 'em.
She's here.
What?! I've never seen one before!
Really? Like how?
Happy Valentine's Day!
So... they sss-still seem normal.
Look, he's a really great guy and I know that you really want this to work out, but I just don't see this having a future.
Okay, no problem. Could you come here for a second?
OH.....MY.....GAWD!!
Three babies?
Well, up yours too!
Doesn't matter.
Or if you prefer, this table is available.
No! They did!
Yeah, I've got something you can do.
What's going on?
Either that or she's just the best, most expensive date I ever had.
May I help you?
Yeah, thanks.
Who's party is it?
Ready.
Hey.
Thank you. Uh...
Great!
So good to see you.
Wow!
Oh wow! That was amazing, was that really just an hour?!
What?
Hello. Oh! It's you. Just ah, just one-one sec. I am going to take this call. When I continue, I hope that there will appear on stage this magical thing that in the theatre we call, committing to the moment!
I won't quit until you try.
It was Jones.
No no, it, it's fine, believe me. I do it too. I always answer with the 'I'm OK' head bob. 'I'm OK.' 'You sure?' 'Yeah, I'm fine.' Hey listen, I've got to set up the music. I got a new CD changer, of course the divorce only left me with 4 CD's to change.
All right, I was 15, it was my best friend, Ruth, and we got drunk on that hard cider, and then suddenly, I don't know, we were, we were making out.
What's my last name?
Oh, hey Rach! I thought we said seven?
Sorry, I just... I wish there was something I could do, you know? Well, you know Phoebe...
I can't believe you didn't know it's twins! This has never happened before.
And now you'll see me buying it.
Oh, my major was totally useless. I mean, how often do you look in the classifieds and see "Philosopher wanted"?
Huuh.
Uh, uh, uh, I am here.
Listen Joey, we definitely want to see you for the callback on Saturday.
Well, ever-ev-... ever since she left me, um, I haven't been able to, uh, perform. ...Sexually.
Oh, it's good news. No, it's definitely good news. Hold on a second, I have another call. Hey, how's it going?
Hey, hey, hey there aren't any clothes in it.
Really?
I don't understand, do you want to go out with Ross?
Do you smell beets?
F.Y.I.. I've decided to pay a professional musician to play in here on Sunday afternoons. Her name is Stephanie... something. She's supposed to be very good.
No.
I'm sorry. I just haven't seen her for so long! All these feelings are rushing back! I'm starting to realize how much I missed her, and I'm gonna need you to break up with her.
3! 2! 1! HAPPY NEW YEAR!!
Yes, this Russell, Ross's divorce lawyer, just tell him that since I haven't heard from him, I assume he's decided to give the marriage a try.
Yeah?
I just think there's somebody better out there for you, I mean I'm not saying me but. maybe me.
Is this cool, huh?
Hey! You made it. Great! Chappy! Hi! Hi! Mom, I know getting married in the street isn't something you approve of...
Your no God's gift to women, that's all in your headdddd. You are just a buttmunch.
Oh wait! I almost forgot. We have to ask everybody this. Other than Days of Our Lives, what's your favorite soap opera?
Hey.
Eh.
Okay. I'll be right back.
Listen. As someone who's seen more than her fair share of bad beef, I'll tell you: that is not such a terrible thing. I mean, they're your friends, they're just looking out after you.
They don't?
You wanna see it?
We get off around midnight, why don't we pick you up then?
Oh, well just probably the worst one since I've been alive.
Hey, you. He's just adorable.
No dear. It's not.
And-and then I sneak out and before Monica can her parents come in.
Why?
Really?
C'mon kid, let's go.
Oh, it's nothing. I went on a date with a guy who lived in this building and it didn't end very well.
Woooo hoooo!!!
I am Father Kalebasous.
Ooh. Ooh. But ya know what would be even sexier?
Wow! Didn't she die like five years ago?
No... well, yeah.
Sure.
Yes, you said that.
Okay, so umm, what's your friend's name?
Seriously? Happily married. So that phone call before, that was ... happy?
Shut up!
Oh, fine. I'm leaving for New York tomorrow, which I hate- but I get to see my son, who I love...
Oh, wow! You remembered! Oh! It's a Judy Jetson thermos!
Bye.
But I'm sorry. There's nothing I can do... Ah, it's not true, there is... nothing I want to do.
I took your advice, I left Myron.
Oh honey, I think I'm having one too!
Y'know what?
The thing is it's kinda on the Q.T. The actor who has the part doesn't know he might be fired. It's the lead in a series, Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.
A little birdie told me something about you wanting to rip your arm off and throw it at me.
Y'know, I don't really know you well enough for you to do that.
So, what'd you tell him?
Huh. Nice to meet you. I'll get started on this.
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Is this, hot Rachel, that you took to the Christmas party, Rachel?
Ohh forget it. Too hell with tradition, we're happy to do it.
Nothing. Ok, everything. I think we're calling off the wedding.
Well I know I was an idiot! And I tried to forget you, I really did! Y'know after we had lunch last year I spent six months in Africa trying to get you out of my head!
You're so bad!
Well, you are not doing a very good job!
You've been married twice?
Hi.
Uh-huh. Is it dirty?
I can't believe this.
Uh yes, I have these two rather beautiful $5 bills.
Wow!
Me too!
Ohh!!
Well that sounds simple enough, let's just do that.
It's me.
Ross, can I talk to you for a minute?
Yeah, yeah, yeah... This is so weird. I mean, you never know when it's gonna be your last dance. And I didn't even get a chance to finish it.
There are a couple of forms to fill out.
Okay.
Uh, it's the college playoffs.
You are now.
Dr. Oberman.
So you like it?
Dr. Remore, report to first floor emergency, stat.
Excuse me. Can, can I help you with something?
Yes. Absolutely. A quality.
I'm sorry, it's just that you're so incredibly beautiful.
Bert, Bert. Bert. Hey, what happened to my friend Bert? He was here just a moment ago. Oh no, my old friend Bert is lost.
Rust, is boat cancer, Ross.
Ross play rugby? I don't think so.
No, you're my first. Put the money on the table.
....oversized bracelets, oversized earrings, oversizing of accessories in general are very popular now.
Hi.
It was, wasn't it?
You guys have such a great place here.
I just came for the red-velvet pillow.
And then after decided to forgive you, seeing you at the airport catching our plane with her.
Monica! You look gorgeous! Last time I saw you, it was eat or be eaten.
Oh my God.
Yep.
What?!
Think I better go before mommy starts weeping.
Jeepers, creepers, where'd you get those peepers? Jeepers, creepers, where'd you get those eyes?
Hey guys!
Joey!
I don't want to see you lose a chunk of that pretty blond hair!
Our FDA approval didn't come through. Something about laboratory rats.
Oh, yeah, my firm represents the band.
Well you kids talk about this place so much, we thought we'd see what all the fuss is about.
Me.
How've you been?
Whoa! This looks like an all day job, I'll have to cancel my yoga class. Hey Ross!
Well, let's go to a bad one and make out.
Come on, you got the shopping bags and the Sack's catalog.
November 16th, 1968.
What?
Not so fast Wesley!
I know. OK, I wasn't completely honest with you when I told you that, uh, I didn't know exactly where he lived.
He's kind of intense huh?
Why not? What's going on?
Joey, it's Anne Geddes. She's a famous artist.
Hey!
Ah? Do you have one here?
Cut.
Ginger.
Here's a copy of your bill.
So Jack, you ever think about trading me in for a younger model?
Ezel.
Don't do this to me, again. You'd know I'd stay here in a minute, but I'd really miss so much work, they'll fire me.
Oh my God. He just gave you the coldest look I have ever seen. It's like he hates you. Then it is true.
Yeah!
Hi!
Wow!!
Let's ditch him!
I don't think so.
Oh, you haven't picked yet. Oh good, 'cause I had an idea. I thought it would be fun if the third groomsman was my family dog. Chappy.
I guess.
It's nice to have a boyfriend.
A 98. I deducted 2 points because you are not wearing your chef's hat, and that is a Section 5 violation.
Apparently Howie's editing now. Yeah, he-he-he calls me up and asks me if he can edit my new movie. Can you believe that?! Y'know I-I-I haven't spoken to him in like ten years and he asks me for a favor!
Listen guys, it was great seeing you again. Mon, um, easy on those cookies, okay? Remember, they're just food, they're not love.
Wow, Monica, if every restaurant is as clean as yours, I'd have a tough time making a living.
All right, I'll tell her. Come on bugger face!
The wedding! There's going to be a wedding. Young lady, don't you sit there and tell me my first grandchild is going to be a bastard! Rachel Karen Green, tell me there is gonna be a wedding!!
Absolutely. Some people are just into appearances.
Well, then it's not on the wall yet.
Hey, Pheebs.
Good luck buddy.
Well, were gonna be layin off people in every department.
So, is it my turn now?
Alright, we'll share.
No, no, it's not like that. I, I work for a medical researcher.
Bing! We're all set for tonight, 8 o'clock.
Oh my goodness! You haven't heard!
I know you do but you and I can never be together that way.
Oh, yeah, I don't like you this way. All right, I'll see you guys later.
Hi.
Action!
All right, all right, there's a few too many people in this room, and there's about to be one more, so anybody who's not an ex-husband or a lesbian life partner, out you go!
"You have two new messages."
...I just get this craving for Kung Pow Chicken.
It's Pam.
Good, good, I'm a lawyer now.
Come on, he's still in the bathroom! I'm begging you!
Well, thanks again for lunch.
Well, we were very young when we had her.
You do?!
You know, I can't tell it again...
What are you doing?
No no no, I wanna hear it from your lips.
No! No!
Oh Drake.
Interesting.
Uh, Phoebe we've been getting complaints and uh, we're gonna move you to a less high-profile spot.
You wanna return this couch? It's cut in half!
Wow, you're here already.
And you promise you'll get this taken care of right away?
You know where I work!
Really?
You must be Ben's mum.
At the uh, supermarket, in the uh, ethnic food section. I helped him pick out a chorizo.
How are you Ms. Hot Shot chef with the big fancy restaurant with the best chicken ever!
Oh no-no, not at all.
But your chin here. Now, you'll feel a small puff of air in each eye.
I must tell you, you look beautiful tonight.
Okay.
Ohh! Yes of course, thank you, thank you, thank you so very much.
What?
I think he's stoned again.
Well we left ours in Monica's bedroom.
What?!!
Oh, thanks, sweetie.
All the appliances are included. There is a lot of light, a new kitchen... I think you guys would be very happy here...
I'll give you another minute.
You too.
Hi, Alan.
Look, forget the check, okay. I like you. I think you're great. Come on, what do you say?
Oh Bing, look at those twin sisters dancing together. Let me buy you a lap dance with those girls. Huh?
I'm a little embarrassed.
I don't know... You know what? I'm gonna put you on with my bear. Hold on.
Oh! Why don't you introduce me?
Ahhhh! I'm sorry!
Thomas, come back here!
Meet me in the bathroom.
Friends. Family. We are gathered to celebrate here today the joyous union of Ross and Emily. May the happiness we share with them today be with them always. Now Emily, repeat after me. I, Emily...
Are you yelling at me?!
Dude!
Don't worry, Hoshi taught me how to use an opponent's strength and weight against him.
Uh-huh, yeah.
Hey, what do you want to drink?
Ross, take me off speakerphone.
It's so nice to finally meet you!
Phoebe?
Oh! I like that. What's your name?
What?!
No, I'm picking you up.
All right, who should we call first, your folks, or Deb and Rona?
Awww.
Okay, now push! That's it push! Just concentrate on pushing! Yeah, here we go!
It's a...
So based on your petition you are seeking an annulment on the grounds that Mr. Geller is mentally unstable.
HI!
Oh look, a standing ovation already! So early in the show. Oh turn around honey; let me see your pretty face.
I made a bet with myself that you have beautiful eyes. Now that I see them, I win.
So who made her queen of the world?
Okay, my next song's called Phoebe Buffay, What Can I Say. I Really Loved When We Were Singing Partners, And I Shouldn't Have Left You That Way.
Then we went to this bar and he hooked us up with all these women!
Have the final numbers on my desk by Tuesday.
Oh well, give it time. So the divorce, the marriage, we've got a lot to celebrate. How about we all go out to dinner tomorrow night?
OK. You better. Oh God, here we go. Hey wanna see 'em go nuts? Watch this. Who needs glasses?
Oh my God, I completely forgot! Oh my God! I can't believe they let us back in this place! .
I'm Andrew, and I didn't pay for this pear.
Actually I did it Ross. You remembered shockingly little of your own speech.
Hi.
A match, a candle...
So, what did Francis leave me?
Hey, waiter.
Oh, well obviously you know Barbara and I split up, otherwise you wouldn't have done the head tilt.
To the Bings!
Oh, that's great. I'm stalking the wrong woman. I am such a dingus!
Diapers huh?
I just had a meeting, I was actually hoping to get transferred up here, but I just found out its not gonna happen. Apparently somebody thinks I'm not eleventh floor material. Say uh, who the hell is this Chandler?
Through the glass doors.
Yeah, people get pretty generous around the holidays. And it never hurts to wear tight trousers.
You mean dying man?
Such a sweet woman.
This is nice. I pay two hundred dollars for dinner, you put down twenty, and you come out looking like Mr. Big Shot. You really want to be Mr. Big Shot? Here, I'll tell you what, you pay the whole bill, Mr. Big Shot, all right.
Hi! My boss let me off early, so I took the train.
Well, there's a service in progress. Have a seat.
Ben. Ben. Ben's good. How come you never mentioned Ben before?
Awww! You know that's probably why babies learn to talk, so they can tell grown ups to cut it out.
Lipson knows. Do you have any idea who else knows?
No.
Monica, Chandler. I'd like you to meet Erica.
Okay, when I got divorced, I didn't think I'd feel this way about someone for a really long time... Then again, I didn't think I'd meet someone like you... and... this may be crazy soon, but... I want you to have this... No, not... that's gum. Ooh, five bucks... I love it when that happens, you know... Think no note's there...
I am Julio.
Well, you never told me how old you were.
Hi, Phoebe! We were just at the drugstore and we got you a little present.
And where is your hat?
It could've been a hair straightener.
So umm, now back to the show. How does it feel to have a huge gay fan base?
How can you do this too me?! I thought I'd made my feelings about Rachel perfectly clear!
Five more seconds.
Hey guy!
Rachel stop!
Okay... Good luck.
Well, when you do, just let me know. I'll be right over there on the edge of my seat.
Oh honey, I'm fine.
Alright, okay.
Very, very bad.
Excellent! What Rachel has shrewdly observed here...
Now go!
I certainly see what the girls like coming here.
I just had sex.
All right. Well, there you go. Stop it, stop it, stop it.
As much as he needs.
Do you have a hair straightener?
Very cool.
And heres the float with the stars of the popular daytime soap Days of Our Lives .
Oh, okay.
Eight o'clock is the cut-off and, aww, it's 8:02.
Nice to meet ya.
You see? That has a clear selling point. It appeals to our key demographic, it's.... You did you come up with that?
Great.
Yes we are. So, coffee?
God, you're gonna be here all night!
You're so sweet! And I'm so surprised!
Hello? Yeah, um. Hang on one sec. Can I take this upstairs?
It's not hopeless! Dr. Stryker Remoray's a miracle worker. Look, here he comes.
So I had fun last night.
Well, that doesn't mean she can't look nice!
I beg your pardon?
Oh yes, there you are.
Don't be too long.
Don't you have to use the bathroom?
I don't know. Maybe maybe low self-esteem, maybe maybe to compensate for overshadowing a sibling, maybe you...
Is Tony Randall dead?
No.
I'm sorry you had to do this by yourself.
So uh, Monica is Ross's sister.
Good. Now imagine your vagina is opening like a flower.
Yeah, and they-and they say that our-that our only chance to have a baby is that if they take my sperm, her egg and put it together in a dish and then put it into another girl. So we were wondering if you could be the girl that we could put it into.
Oh I was just thinking. You know what would be incredible? If you guys died. Ross first has a look of 'huh' then changes it to sarcastic happy: Thank you Amy.
Be right there. Be back in a sec.
I gotta go.
Oh but then, they went and dropped you down that elevator shaft.
Hold on. Fill these out, sit over there.
Y'know what? I may regret this but uh, I'm going to give you a shot.
Or your keys.
Hi.
Wait a minute, wait, this is because of you?
Yes, our system assures total anonimity. We're very proud of it.
No way!
I miss you to. Well, at least I think I do.
Good. Bye!
Look, um I really appreciate your coming down...
Pleasure.
Welcome to the building. I'm uh, Steve Sarah; I'm president of the tenants committee.
What's the matter?
Gotta go. I miss you too, I love you, but it's getting real late now
So, you're a paleontologist, right?
Oh, that's ok. I don't care which of them I beat.
Yes. Yes it is. I burned the formula and I put your diapers on backwards. I mean, I made up a song to sing you to sleep, but that made you cry even more!
Rachel, I need the Versachi invoice. Hello! You don't work for me.
Um
I don't know, I don't have my jammies.
My God, what were you thinking about?
I realise how it's... a bit unorthodox for some people, but I really believe, the most satisfying thing you can do with your life, is take care of a child.
Oh my God, Phoebe.
I think you've got concussion.
I have a question I need to ask you.
Yeah! It's fine, it's fine. Robbie's gonna be here for hours.
Hey you know what, this kid needs me, okay? She needs to have a cool fun aunt!
Oh, that's why you never see pigeons at sushi bars. See, we're having fun.
So, what's this about?
Oh, uh, well, you left your good hair at my apartment, I figured you'd need it tomorrow for your meeting.
Yeah.
Hi.
An Italian Catholic immigrant at this time would not be...
so it was kind of a shock after 25 years of marriage my parents, a perfect couple getting divorced, I kinda took it the hardest cause I was the youngest.
What's in the cup, Ross?
I'm telling you, it's a wonder your mother turned out to be the positive, life-affirming person that she is.
Joey, hang on for a second. Lennart, can we talk to you for a moment?
Jack. Could you come in here for a moment? NOW!
No, I'm sorry. It's just my foot itches like crazy.
Oh, okay. Hey, two beers.
Who drank all the Kamikazes?
Yay! My hero!
I suppose it wouldn't be the end of the world... Oh, thank you!
Y'know I have a torn rotator cuff, a hairline fracture in my right forearm, and a severely bruised Adam's Apple, but that really hurt.
No, no, we're here to give the money back.
I'm telling you! The guy from that show was here in my room, asking me all these weird questions!
...and I know I'll never miss doing it, but I gotta tell you, it's pretty cool knowing that you're making a difference in a kid's life.
Another Minute Maid fiasco.
Help me! This hurts!
Tonight, but don't say anything. Okay?
Phoebe? Mike's ex-girlfriend Phoebe, the love of his life? That Phoebe?
Hi!
Sarah.
We don't have to.
C'mon in.
You're an Aquarius, huh?
Life partner.
Actually, you know, Joey is your friend, and you don't really know me that well; it would be weird.
Hey Rach.
Wow! It looks like you were very generous with your grades this semester!
Hey.
O-kay. Look, it, it was stupid.
Okay.
Well, if I had told you, then it wouldn't have been surprise, now would it?
So you spied on me. I can't believe you don't trust me.
Really?!
Hmm?
Oh my God. That sounds amazing. I would love to see pictures.
No, no, no Ross! Ross, these are friends of mine from home. Liam, Devon, this is Ross.
Well, thank you for giving it back.
That's okay.
Y'know, it's a shame, because you and Lowell would've made a great couple.
Hey, what are you kidding me?
Three.
Car accident.
Please...
Oh no-no-no. Fonzie is the nickname of Arthur Fonzerelli. The Fonz.
So, we're decided, no on plaid, yes on pink?
Ohh, so cute.
Ross, we...we have to be strong. Okay, I-I'm gonna go. Can I? To remember you?
Hey!
Have we talked about the possibility of multiple births?
So?
Hello?
Hello.
Oh hi Phoebe.
Hi, nice to meet you. Kate Miller.
Push. Push. Come on push for five seconds. 5...4...
Hi!
No, no, I am, but only because for the last hour and a half I've been playing the movie Diner in my head.
Oh Drake.
Chandler, hi! I'm sure you've heard we filled the three positions. We just felt that with your maturity and experience, you wouldn't be happy being someone's assistant.
Did you get the grant?
Yeah.
Uh, you guys?
No.
I don't want you taking that thing.
No, no, that's just Chuck Magioni, I-I sold him a house last year! And I'm very sorry, but I don't know where your Father is, and that's the truth.
Clearly you've never been to Sandles Paradise Island.
For I'm loved by a pretty wonderful boy! Hello! And welcome to the show. I see some of our regulars in the audience. And a couple of irregulars.
Yeah, let's go.
Ahh, look at you, you look great.
There you go.
Well let me ask you a question. Am I the Ultimate Fighting Champion?
Anyway, I'm guessing you hired somebody.
Yeah, can I help you with something?
Why do all you're coffee mugs have numbers on the bottom?
You can really arrange that?
So what are you guys out doing today?
I like it.
Hi!
What?!
Ooh, I don't know. Probably the smell of freshly cut grass.
Right... Oh, I got something for you, too.
Oh, you're sweet and cute.
So Phoebe, you ah, sounded kinda serious on the phone, is ah, is anything wrong?
Yes?
He went out with my wife!
Okay, it'll take just a little while to prepare the embryos.
He's under sedation, so he's pretty much out.
Yeah!
A year. On and off. I kinda thought we'd end up together. I don't anymore.
What a small world!
Chandler is fantastic!!
Oh we blew it. I blame myself.
Okay.
Maybe people... found it weird.... So, why do you want to leave Ralph Lauren?
We have red bagels.
Oh Rachel, uhh...
Wow. Oh, I am really flattered, but I just I don't feel that way about you.
We are gathered here today to join Joanne Louise Cunningham and Charles, Chachi-Chachi-Chachi, Arcola in the bound of holy matrimony.
What'd you think I was, a hooker?
Uh, the dog.
She is good!
Oh my God! Bobby!
Well why not you changed Ned's grade!
Oh, you know, wait. I do have one question. Do you guys do random drug testing?
Which one?
And you are...
Well, I don't care about the divorces either, but I wouldn't date him. It's just that he's obviously still in love with this Rachel girl.
Aw, you're right, you're right. I'm sorry.
Nothin' roomie, just watchin' you sleep.
Okay.
Yes. We're very popular. There's a two-year waiting list. Sorry!
Scene 5, take 2.
I love your place! Where is this guy from?
Congratulations on your first week at your brand new job! It won't be long before your the boss.
You too.
Maybe it wasn't Bob, maybe it was a mouse.
A sandwich?
Give me a 'for instance'.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, that's-that's what you're worried about? If that's the problem, we've got no problem.
Bye.
That's fair... Although, can I ask... why do you think that is?
I-I gotta say, I-I-I-I'm not too sure I agree with that.
Hi there.
SOMEBODY ORDER A PIZZA?
Rudolph, the red-nosed reindeer...
All right you two, I'm gonna get going.
I'm in love with you.
We're so sorry.
Hey, Phoebe.
Who's doing shots?
You think?
Is it okay if I finish the apple juice?
Oh, I don't think that. Before today I never thought of you two having sex at all. It was a simpler time.
Thanks for having me over, you guys.
Oh, she doesn't come down here any more. You can find her up on ten.
Oh, oh oh!! I'm sorry, can I interrupt? You know I just want to say..That you are a horrible, horrible person.
Is all this true?
Are you okay? You seem kind of quiet.
It was.
Hi!
I want to become the Ultimate Fighting Champion! It's the most intense physical competition in the world, it's banned in 49 states!
Would you? Or, is it just to sad and desperate, and y'know something that Sophie would do?
Oh yeah, yeah uh, it's down the hall and uh, second door to your left.
... is it weird that it's not with each other?
You can't leave a baby alone!
I never should have broken up with you. I think about you all the time. I mean, do you ever still think about me?
Welcome to introduction to cooking. Now, before we start, can anyone tell me the difference between a hollandaise sauce and a bearnaise sauce?
Whoa, hey, that lady's all kinds of naked.
You're right, you're right. This is about your positions. Now, what I saw in the closet is not the optimum position for conceiving a child, although it might feel good.
So, why did you break up?
All right, let's try one.
Fine! Well then to quote Ross, "I'd better be going."
Monica, you go to the head of the class.
I just realized why I remember this place.
Wasn't it?
I'll tell her that it's over tonight at dinner. I promise.
But, we are.
Come in.
Yeah, sure yeah. Yeah.
I just got a call to be a dancer on a television special for New Year's Eve. It's called some sort of Dick'n Rock'n Dickie Eve.
I'm sorry?
Hey, anybody want to meet a hero?
Actually, he is buying a much bigger place. It's got a great view of Central Pa.....
Yeah.
Oh, no thanks, I'm just waiting for, uh, Joey Tribbiani.
But, you're not identical twins.
Alll right, we'll call you in a few minutes.
Oh my God, Rachel!
And here it is!
Monica.
Sorry, I just saw Ursula. I had to give the engagement ring back.
Hey Chandler, here's this morning's projections.
It's older than that. Ross was actually conceived right near this tuxedo.
I'm sorry. He'll be waiting for me.
Yeah. I mean, I coulda done it better, but these people keep staring at me.
I just sold it to that gentleman.
I'm OK
I just hope...
It's open! Come in!
She's in hiding. She's utterly humiliated. She doesn't want to see you ever again.
Looks good. I'll take it.
Yeah, it is! Naked Ross!!

You're not wearing the patch yet.
I almost forget the tickets, didn't I?
Yesss?
No! Look, I was gonna tell you this over dinner, but I met somebody else. On my trip.
You miss your girlfriend?
You sure they haven't gone bad? You're sure they're not very, very bad?
No, I ahh, had another idea.

Oh come on we went, we went to Time Square, we found ninja stars, I almost got arm broken by a hooker...
Not bad.
Oh, hello. Hello.
I used to umm, schedule my classes so I could watch Dr. Drake Remoray on Days of Our Lives.
Ross!
Baby. Ross.
Um, thank you for the gift.
Hey, Chandler!
Here she comes!
Yes. Plus... what you've got that... I don't know what you've got going... this squirmy quality that you bring into the character that I couldn't've even imagined. Wow, hey, here's what we gonna do: come back tomorrow for the final callbacks with the ***, do all of this what you've got going now, but you know what? more, more. Can you do that?
I've come here to apologize. I think I may have let my feelings for Charlie interfere with the interview process.
But, we're thinking, given the right marketing, we can make Thanksgiving the Mockolate holiday.
I'm the supply manager.
Why?!
Ok, yeah.
What?!
Stop!
Yeah look, about tomorrow, I... I've got a question for ya. I just found out that one of my groomsmen had had an emergency and can't make it.
Ahh!
Joey, you gotta stay until the end. We can't stop filming just for you. It's not like it's your wedding.
Who's up for puppets?
I don't think so. Although, they did mention something about two heartbeats. But I thought that was just mine and the baby's. They kept saying both heartbeats are really strong, and I thought well, that's good 'cause I'm having a baby.
Oh, well I thought that ah...
If anyone asks, we'll just say Ben addressed them. Oh! So you invited Rachel then?
I'll be back in ten minutes.
Is it?
Okay, that doesn't sound good.
Well, at least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar...
Oh I...I think they're funny.
Really?
What kind of surgery?!
Jij Spreekt Nederlands? Dat Is Te Gek. Heb Je Familie Daar?
Good luck.
Hey Joey. Hi. Hey, buddy.
Well, this is fun. So Ross, did you kill any of these wives?
You're not the fan who's dying are you?
Can I have the next one please? Joey and Tony Tribbiani.
How, how is this my fault?
Are you alright?
Well, I'd gotten Judy pregnant. I still don't know that happened.
All right, thank you so much for all your help.
Uh-huh.
Okay, I-I get the picture. Uh, thanks, for your time.
Geller!
Okay, you're dancing with that girl over there.
Finally, I thought we'd never be alone. Can I just tell you something, I have not stopped thinking about you since the party.
Oh, I'm not falling for that one!
Hi sweetie!
No no no!
I can't do that!
Oh thanks! I like your top.
Yes, that's right. We're excited about the level of sophistication you'll be bringing to the job.
Is it bad?
So, in conclusion, the lines all go up , so I'm happy. Great job team! Tomorrow at 8:30. Phil! Nice job. Stevens! Way to go! Joel-burg, you maniac! I love ya! Bing! Good job, couldn't have done it without ya.
Rachel... I heard you guys whispering.
Hey, can we get some cappuccino over here?
Crazy, or... romantic?
Baywatch!!
Someone was in the lady's room, I couldn't wait. I left the lid up for ya though.
Do-do you, do you have brothers?
Oh you're awesome! And, in that last speech? You soaked me.
Like an X-Ray. Bad day not to wear a bra.
Oh! God! Wow!
You ready to go?
Filing system? Oh-oh! You mean those-those little colored labels you put on all the folders? It certainly did brighten up the inside of the filing cabinets.
Yeah?
Uh, that's definitely a, uh, valid question. And, uh, the answer would be yes. Yes I was. But, see, I wanted it to be this phenomenal kiss that happened at this phenomenal moment, because, well, 'cause it's you.
Shall we? .
Bing! You got those numbers for me?
This?
This is the last call for Flight 1066 to Athens. The last call.
What?
Oh really?
Hmm, Lipson knows huh? Ahh, hello Mr. Opossum, enigma of the trees, upside-down denizen of the night, taunting gravity with...
I think it's great you guys are doing this.
You need these books.
Elizabeth, what are you doing here?!
Message erased. To record a message begin speaking at the tone.
You think about it.
Okay. And don't worry, I'm not just gonna take you out for donuts.
I am supposed to be the mommy?
Yeah.
It's so... something... You go girlfriend!
Okay. Will you marry me?
Yeah?
What?! They wanted a scary story!
No, I'm getting three separate heartbeats.
I'll get it. Hello? Ross's place. Mike speaking. It's for you.
Yeah, he took the other one off and hit me with it.
I've been thinking about getting rid of it. I was driving it the other day and saw my reflection in a store window. Your mother's right, I do look like an ass.
Good evening, Miss. Miss? Miss? Miss!
Take a seat. You okay? You feeling all right?
Why?
Yes, yes I was.
Oh.... my.... God.
Hey, Rach! How ya doin'?
Oh, wait, I remember, she also said she wanted to sleep with me one last time.
Ross, are you there? Ross, I don't know if you can hear this but... I'm gonna talk anyway, uh, I'm in the States with you sister and your friends and it's all over with Colin. I came here to tell you that, and to tell you-Yes, Joey you can have all the chocolate you want, just take it! Uh, I came here to tell you that I love you.
Right and then everybody finds out and they're like: "Oh, I knew all along"
And it is annoying when parents put their baby on the phone...

Thanks.
Do you have any question for Erica?
Aren't you with that girl over there?
No, let me explain! Fired!!
Oh, I'm sorry. I'll take this. Excuse me.
And we've tried everything, we've seen a bunch of doctors.
Ewww!!!
So, how ya doin?
No. No, you're not a loser.
Yeah, we are.
Wow! Skates!
You have?
Could you do me one favor, if it's not too much trouble?
No, it's a water balloon fight! We started it!
Gosh, you know, you're just such an amazing couple. It's... kind of intimidating.
Yeah, me too.
Well, I'm from California.
Ah yeah, sorry about that.
"I don't know!"
Oh.
Hi, Dean Lipson, zoo administrator. I was told you had a question.
No, no, no. It's that you're not connected with anything in your body. There's no urgency. The scene is a struggle, uhm, it's a race. Also, what you did was horizontal. Don't be afraid to explore the vertical. And don't learn the words. Let the words learn you.
Hey! How's my pal Toby doing today?
Whoooaa!
But you're not anymore!
Are you talking about me?
Miss?
I'm sorry.
Hi Phoebe, nice to meet you. So, how ya been?
We just know she's got the IQ of a napkin.
Hey Chandler?
YOU IDIOT!!!!!
Hi, darling. Where's my grandson, you didn't bring him?
You've spoiled everything! It's like a nightmare! My friends and family are out there! How can I face them?! How can you do this to me?!
Oh, am I! I just danced with a wonderfully large woman. And three other girls made eyes at me over the buffet. Oh, I'm not saying it's something I wanna pursue, but it's nice to know I have options.
Why, what happened?
Terribly nice of you to offer to pay for half the wedding.
Great!
Chandler? What an unusual name! You must've had terribly fascinating parents.
Of course, sir.
Let me just see if I got this straight. I tell you to stay away from my daughter or I'll have you fired. What you heard was, "Take my daughter, come up to my country house, and ruin my weekend with Rachel!"
My best shoes, so good to me. I wear them everyday. Down at the heel, holes in the toes. Don't care what people say. My feet's best friends, pals to the end. With them I'm one hot chicky. Though late one night, not much light, I....
I can't say I care too much for that smell you've brought in with you.
Where have you been?
No! I did!
What?
It's Bob actually. Hey, you work up here, can you tell me where this Chandler Bing's office is?
Yeah? Listen closely, Devon has got a weak ankle.
I know this is crazy but am I too late?
Well, people!
Are you wearing my glasses?
Hi, nice to meet you.
I said it was typical. Typical of you, Rachel Green, Queen Rachel does whatever she wants in little Rachel land.
Would you like some more coffee, baby-doll?
I don't know. They-they must be your mother's, but please, please don't ask her. I'll throw these away.
its Mike Hanagen.
...and her yoga and her Bridges of Madison County...
Good idea! Yes!
Ohhhh!
Yeah! Right!
Oh wow! I'm free for her!
Err... we know what we want.
OK, I don't want to freak you out or anything, but I think I just saw a rat in your cupboard.
Were you this cute in high school?
Well, you were fired.
I'm gonna leave the three of you alone.
What do you got down there, Vic? What do you got under that tarp?
I can't speak for Emily, but Susan is in a loving, committed relationship.
So. How'd you guys meet?
I'm gonna go talk to uh, a friend.
It's a different building.
In the park?
Op, this is saved. Gift shop.
Almost time for cake.
So what if it was? I thought there was nothing going on between you two...
Hello? Rachel?
Well I'm gonna have to put on a new lock, they'll find out anyway.
Well, I have huge news.
Why the Post?
No.
Yeah!! Little Leslie is here! We got another one! Oh my God, I can't believe I have two-two children. How scary is that?
No, but I can't-
Okay. Okay. Would, would it help if I went over and apologized?
Um-hum. Talk New York to me again.
So, you look great.
No, no, no wait! Don't tell me. Let me guess. Joey, Monica, Ross, Rachel and, I'm sorry Phoebe didn't mention you. Chandler, I'm kidding all ready you're my favorite!
Thank you! Good meeting you.
Okay, I'll see you at the station later.
Umm, anyway...Do you want to have dinner tonight?
Yes.
I'm also allergic to peanuts, and cashews, and almonds, and filberts...
Plus, what are you planning on doing with the baby while you're trotting out to the garbage ten times a day?
Keep in mind, he's never used this product before, you're gonna see how easy this is to do. Go ahead. This works with any milk carton.
Okay, I guess you can...close the door now.
This is the final boarding call for flight 67 to San Diego, boarding at gate 42A.
But Rachel I thought she just had a baby with Ross.
So ah, Monica ready yet?
Really?!
Maybe. I was thinking about getting a cat, I was just going to go to the shelter but... Okay, why not?
Hey, y'know I was thinking, what are the odds like if-if, if you stuff like 200 of them in there?
Yes! Yes! Please, just give it to me!
Threatening letters, refusal to meet deadlines, apparently people now call you mental.
Sure!
Bye.
No.
Well, I've been calling you, but it turns out I had your number wrong. And when I finally got the right one from Information, there was no answer. So I thought I'd just come down here, and make sure you were okay.
Alright, let's take this outside.
I'm really sorry but I may be a little while longer.
Oh, thanks.
Hey!
Hey!
So when do you imagine you gave them to me? In the morning or in the afternoon?
Rachel?
Oh, Bob, he was nothing compared to you. I had to bite my lip to keep from screaming your name.
Nope.
Um-hmm, and did you stay up all night in preparation for your sleep study. Uh, sir?
Well, if that's what you kids are calling it these days then, yes I am. I uh, I've kinda been waiting for the right person.
So where's the young lady who I'm supposed to take downtown!
Oh, believe me, I don't want to get hurt either. I'm being smart about this. See these guys? They're the best trainers in the world, and Hoshi here used to be a paid assassin. A house painter! He used to be a house painter.
Seriously? Its.. its just these rooms? I thought you were a doctor.
I'm all done.
Oh, okay, I get it.
Wanna peek?
Jij Hebt Seks Met Ezels.
I'm sorry Joey, as long as he's here and he's conscious we're still shooting.
Yeah, could you scooch?
We'll go to a hotel.
So you see Wigglemunch, that's why it's important to shaaaaaaare...
Y'know, I'm actually glad Phoebe called. I know we broke up because you thought I wasn't mature enough, but I've really grown up and think we should get back together.
We were just talking about you.
I still love you. And I know I probably shouldn't even be here telling you this, I mean you're with Chandler a guy I really like, and if you say he's straight I'll believe you! After seeing ya the other night I knew if I didn't tell ya I'd regret it for the rest of my life. Letting you go was the stupidest thing I ever did.
Oh, sure. I'm showing it to someone else right now, but please, look around.
Right.
Oh my God!
What?
13.
This is... great...
I know you did, cookie. Oh, I know you did. So tell me. Did you see her?
You know, we're all wondering who this Rachel is. Can you point her out to me?
Actually it's, it's quite, y'know, typical behaviour when you have this kind of dysfunctional group dynamic. Y'know, this kind of co-dependant, emotionally stunted, sitting in your stupid coffee house with your stupid big cups which, I'm sorry, might as well have nipples on them, and you're like all 'Oh, define me! Define me! Love me, I need love!'.
Well I wouldn't miss it for the world. Oh! I'm getting all misty here! You'd think I was having my legs waxed or something.
Alright, then I'm gonna change my name.
Okay.
Can't you see what's going on here, this man is dying.
I understand that would be difficult.
I mean, I can't-I can't be in the same room as her! It drives me mad just thinking of you being in the same room as her!
Oh, well, likewise. Actually, not likewise. I've never heard of you until this morning, but, it's nice to be nice!
The doctor will be here in a minute to do your sonogram.
Rachel?
Actually, I'm a... kind of a.... you know, a... date-type... thing... of Rachel's.
Nice to see you Rachel.
Hey everybody.
Can you believe how we spent our two weeks together?
One, two, three...
Yeah.
You two could really hit it off! I'm gonna go mingle.
We've gotta go, we've got that cab waiting.
Rachel?
Yeah. We have rat babies now.
Yep! I sure know how to pick 'em, huh? Y'know I gave up a part on a soap for this!
Sure. Sure. Second's up! Not...that kind of table.
It really was. There was this great little pastry shop right by my hotel. There you go, dear.
I'm going to keep dating him Mother, and there's nothing you can do about it!
And guess what? Good news! I got another job!
Move!
Richard? We're ready for you. Joey Tribbiani? This is Richard Crosby he's playing Vincent.
Comin' through. Move, move.
Monica bang!
For what?
Yes, yes, I did. In fact, I had sex with him 2 hours ago.
I'm thinking that you are looking really fine it that dress.
Yeah, if the best is like unbelievable pain!
Hello, Sir. You're here to return those pants?
I'll see you after work sweetie.
Stop!! Stop it! You must stop! You are bad actors! This is a terrible play! I'll see you in the morning.
Yeah.
Hey!
Pete?!
N-No running in the chapel!
Uh, I am, uh, being naked?
Okay, there's an herbal tea you can drink.
No! It's because that way the camera only sees her! Do you wanna try it?
There was also leaves and guk and stuff.
What's a matter with you?
Oh right, you've got a church group meeting tonight.
Where you goin'?
Well, I guess having Rachel back wouldn't be the worst thing in the world.
Oh, you're back... this is my wife, Nancy.
Okay, then.
What?
Oh, I don't know about that.
Yeah. That's okay, right?
Hey!
He's good with rear things, bring him in too.
You're right, I apologize. Scratch the last question. Spell "Boscodictiasaur".
Okay, um, don't take this the wrong way, but your place kinda has a weird smell.
That's great! That's wonderful!
Oh, I see. Well, I'm just gonna put in a call here and we'll find out what's goin' on and straighten it out. Yeah, hi, Lori please. Hi darling. So how 'bout Joey Tribbiani for the part of the cab driver, isn't he terrific? Uh-huuuuh. Uh-huuuuh. OK, doll. Talk to you later. Yeah, you're gonna have to sleep with her.
Look, I. . .
Guys. Seriously, it is not like that.
That's about 60 cents.
Hey.
Wow.
You don't secretly smoke do you?
No! No! I wanna see you take-off.
May I help you?
What are you? Eight?
Now I do.
What?
Phoebe?
You kids ready?
Really. What?
No, the line is pick a bag, so you need to pick up the bag.
Rachel was just helping me out. My head got all sunburned.
You just don't know how hard it is, Phoebe. There's just so many of them. You know, two I can handle. Two's great. You just hold one in each hand, but what do I do when the third one runs at me with his bike helmet on. I've got no more hands to protect my area! There's three of them, Phoebe, three!
Ross.
Hey Chandler, you can't keep your hands off her for one second!
Well maybe you can date him then that would save me the trouble of killing him. Are you okay?
Oh, my God, maybe you're right. Maybe I don't need him. I deserve to be treated with respect.
Right. We do have a table for two available, perhaps you would be more comfortable.
This is contestant number sixteen, Rebecca...
Yeah, they wanna see you again tomorrow.
You're table's ready sir.
Hello, Waltham Interiors.
Folks, when we come back we'll be talking about her new book, 'Euphoria Unbound': the always interesting Nora Tyler Bing. You might wanna put the kids to bed for this one.
Hi! It's Tom, I'm here to pick up the phone.
Oh hey, how are you?
That's great. What kind of music do you play?
That's great! Hey! Excellent!
What?!
It's raining men!
Look, we held the curtain for you buddy. Come on, let's go! Let's go!
Then we agree?
Yeah, drop it! Drop the towel! Please drop the wowww.
Wa-wa-wa-wait! Congratulations! You did it! You did it! You can relax now. Yeah.
Oh come on! Don't be such a baby!
Oh no-no, never say that. If we can't get it out then we can cut around the stain, add a little lace, you make a stylish throw.
What is it, Tim?
Joey, well thank you. That is so sweet. Oh, excuse me.
Hey. Look, I'm sorry about yesterday, I, um-
Sabrina. I know about you two. I saw you today kissing in the doctor's lounge.
Yeah, I've been coming here since I was a kid. This used to be my Grandma's.
I was actually relieved uh I didn't win the boat. My wife would've killed me.
Would you like to see them?
Who?
Am I interrupting?
I know! It's awful. I love you.
Ross, look, I know I've been giving you a lot of jabs and it's partly because I'm very protective of Lizzie, and partly because well, they just keep coming to me. But I have to admit that after all the wonderful things that Lizzie has told me and the many, many, many stories that Rachel has told me that, well you're not all bad.
Hey!
Yeah! Yeah, it was definitely an improvement. G'night.
You were so funny with that waiter! You're such a nut!
You got married again.
Okay!
Uh-huh.
I can't believe Emma is already one!
Well, my nose got lonely.
What?
Who in God's name are you?
Oh hi, come on in. I'm Catherine, the listing agent.
Oh!
Cool! I-I'll see you then.
You didn't marry your Barry. I did.
Thank goodness.
Are ya getting married?
Mm. Unless we go with a different dress?
Oh my God, Rachel!
Hi, I'm Joshua, I'm here to pick up Rachel.
Yeah. My Dad says if I spend as much time helping him clean apartments, as I do daydreaming about outer space, he'd be able to afford a trip to the Taj Mahal.
They still want me for General Hospital.
Okay, I'm going to need a comforter, but did you have a hypoallergenic one because otherwise I get very nasal. Do you have a cat? 'Cause it's already happening. Do you hear that?
Michael, a pimp spit in her mouth!
Chandler?
Oh my God, you are so paranoid!
Ok, unless you're not gonna try to get me to join a cult are you?
I'm Gail.
Hey Rach, hey you.
You mean like exclusive friends?
I'm sorry, it's not here.
Hey!
Rachel, don't do this. This is just because you're turning thirty.
Surprise!
You spend half your life in the bathroom, why don't you ever go out the bloody window!
I'm sorry. Does the smoke bother you?
Happy?! Is that what I'm supposed to be Vic? Happy?
I-I'm sorry. I, I-I-I believe I ate that.
Excuse me, I'm sorry, you haven't said anything for about two and a half minutes, are you at all interested?
What're you doing?
Yeah! I've been working so hard this semester. I really need to go crazy y'know, blow off some steam.
Well, little Jamie here is our third. So, if you have questions or you need anything at all, just holler.
Your eyes are very pretty.
We're gonna have a big family, I've always wanted a big family!
Oh, I don't mean to be a square, but I'd really appreciate it if you wait and drink your wine after the kids are asleep? Oh uh, thanks for this, I hope I can do the same for you sometime.
Yeah, whatever.
It's kidney stones.
This is Wayne, the man who created and operates C.H.E.E.S.E.
All right then, it's settled.
Oh.
Look, youre cold, I have to pee, and... ..theres a cup of coffee on the window. How bad could it be?
Bye.
You don't think I'm cute?
Well, if we learned one thing today C.H.E.E.S.E. is that cheerleaders and high explosives don't mix.
Ah, which ever is closest.
But, we can't go now. It looks like Rachel's gonna put on a skit.
Joe. How's it going?
Oh my God! Did you talk to him?
Ohhhhh!
Tell her, David. 'I don't wanna go to Minsk and work with Lifson and Yamaguchi and Flench, on nonononononono. I wanna stay here and make out with my girlfriend!!'
No, seriously. These hands. These miracle, magical, life-giving hands. Oh, just to be near them, touch them, maybe even lick one?
Rachel.
We kinda need to talk.
Okay, listen, I really like you. Okay? I think this can go somewhere. So what if I'm close to my family, are you gonna let that stand in the way of us?
I don't know? Do I? Do I?
It's not the pants. It's you that is backwards. And if, and if you don't understand how important this is to me, well then, perhaps we shouldn't get married at all!
Hey, she just woke up! She's hungry. Why don't we give this another try?
We might still have some money, if your father didn't think it was a good idea to sell ice over the Internet.
You blew them away!
Grazie.
Your mother just added him to her list.
L!
Ross, you didn't tell me you were a doctor!
Here, I'll get it.
Ah here, we brought wine.
Mr. Bing? Here you are! You'll go into that room and deposit your specimen into the container.
Well, that's why you wanted me to come, right?
Alrighty. Were gonna start with some basic third stage breathing exercises, so Mummies, why dont you get on your back? And... coaches, you should be supporting Mummys head.
No.
that is so wrong and on top of that his a glue sniffer.
Me too!
Well, Sid and I are trying again and we had trouble last time because apparently we...
Oh-ho, I think it's nice.
Oh god, don't tell me, I did it wrong.
Anyway, it was lovely seeing you.
Hello, there. I'm Dr. Carlin. I see someone's having an allergic reaction.
Yeah, uh, Joey said I could use your shower, since, uh, Chandler's in ours?
Dr. Farber, Bobby Rush is here for his adjustment.
Yeah! You're saying, you need to be with someone more mature. Maybe someone with, a license to practice medicine. Or a mustache.
Tribbiani! Hold on, I'll get the plunger.
Wow!
We'd better take these pants off upstairs or that stain's gonna set.
Well, not unless it's got something to do with dehydrating my man because right now I'm a dehydrating maniac!
Bye Phoebe.
Don't spoil it.
Well, I got tanked myself last night. Pretty dicey drive home, Tapanzi Bridge never looked smaller. That's okay, you're still my number one guy! Bing!
Like I tried to tell you in the interview Ross, this grant is not based on your knowledge of pretty useless trivia.
That's one way! Me, I- I went for the watch.
I knew you'd understand.
Do you want to ride around town on my little pink bicycle?
Hey!
...the lullabye of...
I'm Marjorie.
Your first marriage?
Okay, I just slapped my future sister-in-law's ass.
That was great, the kids loved you.
Almost! But first, we gotta start.
You know, I don't know what I'm looking for.
Look, I know it must be hard that your wife is a lesbian, but it's wrong. You're married.
Okay, anytime.
Yeah, isn't he?
Well, maybe I'll bring it out and have Monica stick her finger in it. That oughta sweeten it up, huh?
No, you didn't. Hi, I'm Kathy.
OK Phoebe, you ready to try one?
Well, you're just going to say no again but...gay porn.
No, go ahead.
Hey! He has a name, it's Dragon. Do you wanna know your name? Check your hat. We did the hat right?
What, is he your pet rat?
"A donation has been made in your name to the New York City Ballet".
No, that's cold, that's cold, that's...
We had a good time. By the way, I wanted to ask you something. It would really mean a lot to me, if the baby was a boy, that you name him after my father, Jiminy Billy Bob.
Uh, your door isn't sound proof.
Morning!
Huh. What's Tag's last name?
What do you, what do you think?
I'm sorry. Christmas is a very busy time, sir.
Well, I don't know what to tell ya!
Kids, I spoke to a doctor and picked up this pamphlets on how to get pregnant.
Oh, you mean it? That would be so fun!
Well, maybe you and your baby should go to another strip club.
Ooh... Is it because of what might be on the bedspread, because I saw that news report too, with the infra red and the ... I could just...
Goat cheese, water chestnuts, and panchetta.
It's been an hour. ??? be willing to reconsider switching to a smaller table.
Yeah! That's right. Yeah-yeah! Yeah!
Oh, by the way, tomorrow we're auditioning for a Broadway show.
Who are you talking too?
I have a ring.
Two days before Christmas? Sorry, man.
It can't be any harder than this... I mean, If I had known the last time I saw you would be the last time, I... I would have stopped to memorize your face, the way you move, everything about you. If I had known the last time I kissed you would have been the last time... I never would have stopped.
You can tell her I think her friend is cute.
Thank you.
Phoebe, can I talk to you for a second?
Hi guys. I haven't seen you since this morning.
Ma'am, please sit down!
There's one leaving in thirty minutes.
So it was really cool seeing you lecture today.
I should just go on to happier things, okay? Umm, why don't you tell about your lovely wedding?
Dennis is a dear old friend and a fantastic lover.
Rough numbers?
You can put the aisle over here , and put the wedding ceremony right over here.
Don't worry about it.
So, how did your audition go today?
Which guy?
Bye.
I'm Dutch.
Oh my god.
We're driving!?
Please, please take him too.
Shut the door! Shut the door!!
No. And I don't think I'm gonna want to.
Welcome back!
I just did them.
Excuse me for a moment, will you please, I want to say good night to the Levines, before we go.
No... It's lovely. The lights and the snow. I could look at them forever.
For 50 bucks, you can get one book! What will it be? A? B? C?
Really?
Ohhh.
Happy birthday sweetie.
Here you go.
Monica?
Oh! Gosh! This is brilliant. Gosh, it's just like old times. I'm so happy you two are friends again!
That's not what we talked about!!
Hi.
Pizza guy!
Why did you have to fill your father's head with all that garbage about making things right? Things were fine the way they were! There's chicken in there, put it away. For God's sake, Joey, really.
Well, I believe that the answers lie in the osteological evidence. I plan to begin there.
Well he got sick, and then he got sicker, and then he got a little better but then he died.
Guess what, I got an audition!
Just hear me out!
This is impossible. Its just impossible.
Okay.
This is a nice resume. Nice, nice, nice. Muy impressivo.
Joey!
I don't believe this, hold on a second. You guys die and I don't get your baby?
This is what my mom was talking about. Whiners are wieners. Look, you want your friends to be happy, right?
The one I told you about last week?
There's nothing to wonder about, Monica. You're gonna go back to being exactly who you were, because that's who you are.
Here's what's gonna happen. The music's gonna start, you're gonna dance, we're gonna tape, you don't look at the camera. Any questions?
I will if you will.
Benji?
Wow, you're a lot nicer on 'Days of Our Lives'.
What?
Oh, that's so... It really is...do we know...?
You made him a candle light dinner in the park?
Those earrings look really lovely on you.
Well... I just talked to Sid, we are definitely putting in an offer on the house... a-a-and I'll bet we get it.
Well, I might.
Thank you. I'm going to rejoin my dinner party.
I thought I would, but the translation's no good.
Look, I just wanted to have coffee with Rachel.
You gonna slice them up real nice?
We may not have any weapons, but we still have food. In the basement I saw potatoes and some dry pasta, and a few tins of tuna!
Yes?
Rach! Rach!
Uh well, the game was too complicated and research showed people didn't follow it.
Give us a kiss. Come on! Come on!
Come on little Chandler, it's time to be born. Come on little Chandler! Come on!
Oh, please, honey, listen, if I can do it, anybody can. You just start with half a dozen European cities, throw in thirty euphemisms for male genitalia, and bam! You have got yourself a book.
Hey guys, I just uh, wanted to invite you to the party tomorrow night.
Get a load of this... She's proposing to him. Guess we know who wears the pants in that family.
Hi, oh, I'm Lauren, Kate's understudy.
I think I will be all right! You wanna volley a bit for a serve?
1...2! Y'know what? You're young; you probably don't have glaucoma.
Okay. Understanding a little more why you're single. Ohh! Y'know, I have a friend you would like, she's really pretty. And then we could double date!
We met with him. Did he show you the photos of the nude wedding he did?
I've looked everywhere. There's no gas leak.
Mmm. Bob Buttons. Here, Bob Buttons.
Oh, that I were a glove upon that hand, that I might... touch thy cheek...
Give me twenty seconds on the clock. Ready? Go!
Oh it's great! It's great! Thank you so much for introducing us!
Which one? Which button, Jack.
Joey, all the roles got to dance a little. But believe me with your dance background it'll be a piece of cake.
No.
No nonsense! We're all in this together.
Yeah, a woman I went to college with just became the first female blacksmith down there.
It's allright! Crying is good. It lets the boo-hoos out.
Oh no, no-no-no, is he ah, married, or involved with anyone?
I was gonna have Thanksgiving at my girlfriend's.
Okay.
Sooo!! Anyway...
Umm, I-I thought we were moving forward and now you're-you're sending me all these mixed signals. What are you trying to tell me?
Well actually they're taping tomorrow. I don't really understand why.
...it's uhm... i-it's two on each cheek and uhm... and one on the lips.
Dudes.
Madame, you must have your boarding pass..
Yeah.
Bye!
Oh look, you don't have to give it too me right now! You can slip it under my door.
No. But God, a house made of cheese, wouldn't that be incredible?!
Hey.
Oh, it's... my girlfriend.
Oh, yeah!
Sir?
Yeah, well, sorry, Joe. You said let's just be friends, so guess what?
Maybe I'll just turn the lights down a little.
No no. Henry's almost two and he's talking and everyting. Here. You know, the other day he told me he liked me better than his other grandpa. Now in all fairness his other grandpa's a drunk but still. . .
I really can't slap you.
Hey!
Hi. Uh, did I accidentally drop a condom in your case? It's kind of an emergency.
Uh, that's our friend Tanya.
All right, first thing we gotta do, damage control.
I want a retraction! Our food is not inedible swill!
Joey Tribbiani, this is...
Y'know what daddy? If you don't like Ross, that's fine. It doesn't matter to me, I'm gonna go out with him anyway.
Plus hotels are fun! My room has this little fridge full of free snacks!
But I'm not gay. And I especially wouldn't want you to think I was gay.
You want me to kick you guys out instead?
Hi, can I help you?
All right, all right.
Alright. Now I would like to see you wearing nothing but them. Take your clothes off.
Oh my God! Someone, he's choking. Is anyone here a doctor?
That was an accident! And so were you.
Huuh.
Oh I feel very lucky, she's great. I think she's the most beautiful woman I've ever seen.
Dance with him.
Estrangement .
We were just chit-chatting. How's your friend?
I'm sorry, but isn't your wife back in New York?
Okay, but that would actually be a big step down for me.
Certainly. Very well. And Dr. Geller, when is my birthday?
I don't have anything.
No-no-no, that was all true. This was just in case you pulled a Monica.
I'll feel better when I'm there, and I can know where you are all the time.
I put that tube top on as a joke.
I'm pregnant.
Ice coffee? Tell me it's ice coffee!
You did a good thing today.
Ms. Waltham?
You got it.
Hey guys.
Oh my God! Ray-ray Green?!
Good job.
Plate?
Oh yeah, well who serves steak when there's no place to sit, I mean how are you supposed to eat this?
Oh! You're right. Oh God. But, before I can say 'good-bye', there's something I really need you to know, Chandler. The way I feel about you, it's like, I finally understand what Lionel Richie's been singing about. Y'know, I mean what we have, it's like movie love, you're my soulmate, and I can't believe we're not going to be spending the rest of our lives together.
We were having lunch. Yeah and then all of the sudden we were like, "Hey! Y'know, we're here, having lunch let's get married!
Oh. That's a funny noise.
Oh, ohhhhh.
Ohh... Oh! You were not meant to see me before the wedding. It's bad luck.
Thanks.
She's out, I'm gonna take her home.
That's not a good idea, that's kinda the reason the last guy got fired.
Listen, we both know you're gonna do it 'cause you're not a jerk. Okay? So you can either sulk here for a half hour and then go pick them up, or save us both time and sulk in the car.
Hey, how do you guys get anything done?
Oh, no, nonononono, you see what he's doing? He knows no-one's gonna say all those names, so they'll wind up calling her Geller, then he gets his way!
Definitely her.
Hey.
Okay. It was nice to see you.
Ass and face.
I'm sorry. Was I not supposed to?
They're every four minutes and last 55 seconds.
Well you can have the suite if you want. We don't care about where we stay. We're here to celebrate our love together. We don't have to get free stuff. We just want to be together.
...there's gonna be a wedding! That's unacceptable Rachel! What the hell does love have to do with it anyway?! There are more important things in a marriage other than love! ...constantly thinking about things! You have to think about the consequences of your decision.
Yeah.
Do you think that maybe, sometime, I could...
Dr. Wells is a woman.
I gotta tell you, I can't believe I'm doing this with you. Although I did just get out of a nine-year relationship, so I guess I should be open and taking some risks.
Well, this has been fun.
Bon giorno tutti!
I am telling you, up until I was, like nine, I thought that gunpoint was an actual place where crimes happen.
Hello
This is huge, you can buy me beer.
Last stop, Montreal. This stop is Montreal.
Thank you guys for having us over.
Well, you do realise the odds of that happening are a little slimmer if they never get to meet the guy..
Alright, here you go my friend. Eggs a-la Eddie, huh?
Marlon-
Phoebe, will you marry me?
Yeah, y'know. Happy holidays from Mona and Ross. It'll be cute, okay?
Oh yeah-yeah, we should get the... So when Jessica kisses a man, she usually puts umm, both her hands on the man's face.
Friends. Family. We are gathered to celebrate here today the joyous union of Ross and Emily. Now Ross, repeat after me. I Ross...
Uh, Phoebe, uh, I have... something I wanna say.
Now, do you think it should say, "Love Ross and Mona?"
See the thing is umm, we're not able to y'know, uh, conceive.
Oh. Look, just friends, I won't grope you. I promise.
Well, you know, you have to take a course. Otherwise, they don't let you do it.
Uhm... I can't do anything tonight.
Well, I wouldn't call her a star, but she's really good. You should check out Inspecther Gadget.
Oh, I thought there was a mirror there. Okay, bye-bye.
No, I'm okay.
Well, if you want, I'll justI'll just break it off with her.
I wanted a big wheel. And instead my parents got me this little plastic chicken that you hop around on. It was embarrassing; kids made fun of me. That was a pretty tough year.
Did you know your mother spent $1200 dollars on bansai trees. I felt like Gulliver around that place.
No suds, no save. Ok?
Here, let me. Rachel Green's line, how may I help you?
I dunno. Maybe you wanted your marriage to fail.
I wasn't invited.
Okay.
No, no, no, no!
All right, all right, I'm coming over, and I'm bringing Chinese food.
But were fine.
Sure, sure. What's with the chair.
Charlotte who?
What's green and says "hey, I'm a frog"? A talking frog! Oh, no, you can't have him, he's too funny.
Really? You two?
Oh, yeah. Had that dream.
And uh, Liam, Liam's got bad knees. You hit him right and he'll go down like a lamp.
And we were both in the Peace Corps.
Unfortunatly the only thing we have available is our deluxe suite, the rate is six hundred dollars.
Cut.
You're late!
Got it!
Anyway, that's all I know. That, and this. This is the real him.
So why can't the three of us go out together?
Sure. What?
Ah actually, that is mine.
Oh, I miss you already. Can you believe this happened?
Okay! Thank you! That was great!
I knew you'd be here!
If you have the time, I'd really appreciate the help.
Everything was delicious!
You making fun of me? Because I am not a sell-out. I didn't do that for the money, I believe in those phones. I almost lost a cousin because of bad wireless service.
No we won't.
I could be Chandler's new roommate.
Yeah!
Bye! See you later!
You are!
It's time for me to conquer the physical world.
Joey!!! Happy Birthday!!
Well, I'll see you later.
Well, I y'know, I was just, umm, I was just thinking and hoping, that umm, maybe you'd want to get back together?
It's probably because not mature enough. Or smart enough. Maybe he doesn't like the way I dress-No that can't be it. It's really gotta be the smart thing. Oh I'm so stupid! I'm just like this incredibly pretty stupid girl!
Hi!
The next tour of the wine cellar will plan in two in-in minutes...
No!
Drake, what're you getting at?
So, these are the preliminary forms for an open adoption. There's a lot to go over, but I'll explain everything as we go through it.
What?
Hi! Thank you so much for coming again. Did you like it tonight?
Why not?
Maybe in L.A?
Not so much, no. He had clearly memorized all the stuff to say, and some of it didn't even make any sense.
Have to...
You can't order until your entire party has arrived. Restaurant policy.
You don't want him, but you don't want me to have him?
Hola, Joey!
Ross!
Well, actually, you only got to sing 'Memo-'.
All right, you two, stop it!
It's a money thing, we don't have any.
Hi, I'm Karen.
Five dollars a box.
You picked a great couch.
Oh good, you're here. Yeah, and I was worried that it was going to be uncomfortable.
Hi.
It's kind of a risky joke Tag, and what is-what is this drawing I can't figure out what this is?
No, it's a wedding ring. You gotta get rid of it. We're gonna go to the East River right now and throw it in there!
Oh, I-I'm just making a list of people's birthdays.
Thank you! Enjoy your flight?
Monica, why don't you finish off these pies? I don't have any more room left in the fridge.
So Rachel, your mom tells me you changed your major again.
Alright.
This is so much fun, just the girls. You know what we should do? Does anybody have any marijuana?
Don't you want to know about the sex?
No, I'm sorry. I have to go.
Well, I can't take this plane now.
You don't say!
Oh, my baby!
Wow, you look unbelievable.
Ok, so it's a tie again, 41 to 41.
I tell ya a lot things!
That's Carol with your son!
Ooh, hey! Hey, there little fella. Mr. Fuzzy-Man, how are you doing? Aww. Eww! Oh! Eww! Gross! Idiot!! Stupid little, fuzzy, yellow creature!! Oh look at me, I'm so cute, I'm a little chick who's disgusting! God, you're so stupid, how are you not yet extinct!! Quack-quack, quack-quack!! What are you quacking about?! Dumb Donald Doo-Doo!!
Yeah?
Oh great! Thanks Ross, you're such a good friend!
May I help you?
'Cause Rachel told me uh, you were dying to have a threesome with me and uh, Drew Barrymore. By the way, Drew has some groundrules and...
That's fine, for now we'll just call her Baby Girl Green.
She went to pick up Aunt Liddy.
Half a dozen.
Uhm, did you guys know that there is a giant ice sculpture in the hall?
You really sure?
Hi. I'm Monica.
If you didn't pour the coffee, no one would have anything to drink.
Uh-huh, I don't know.
Wait!
I'm ready for more.
Where else would lame Mr. No Balls hide it?
Yeah, well your friends are in violation of it. I've been a nice guy up until now, but uh, I don't need this grief. I'm gonna call the landlord and tell him that Monica is illegally subletting here grandmother's apartment. Your friends are outta here pal.
Well, you're practically dancing already. Why don't you just do it over here?
Problem odour in the litter box? Don't change your kitty, change your kitty litter.
Wait! Wait! Listen! Listen to this! Y'know what I wanted to be when I was that age?
Hey! How's Ben?
So when are you getting married?
Hey, hi, I need a ladle. You got a ladle?
No.
I have a gun.
Noth- I was- I was just saying to my-
So, I'll call you tomorrow.
Right. But, see, the longer I waited, the more phenomenal the kiss had to be, and now we've reached a place where it's just gotta be one of those things where I just like... sweep everything off the table and throw you down on it. And, uh, I'm not really a, uh, sweeping sorta fella.
Well, you seem fine.
Huh. Yeah?
You know it's twins, right?
So it's down to these two, Nancy I know you like this one and I think I agree. Rachel, what do you think?
It's okay if it bothers you. Really. I mean the only thing I need to know is 'how much it bothers you?' because I don't like wasting my time. Am I wasting my time?
No, no-no, no-no, my point is that I kept coming back because, I wanted to see you.
Why don't we have dinner tonight and talk about it?
Yeah, I do. Of course, I learned at my aunt's dog grooming shop, but hey, what do you say?
Oh, they're both exclus...
Look Rachel, I know what you're going through. I'm totally freaked about turning 25.
No, no! What I mean is, I hate going back to my apartment now... and partly because I live above a known crack den but... mostly because when I'm there, It's just, I really miss you. So.. do you want to move in together?
Pheebs! Hey Pheebs!
You're Erwin's daughter?!
When's your birthday?
I got beer.
Oh, look who's here, it's the weenies.
I think I brought back half of the beach in my hair. It was so much easier when I used to shave my head.
Yeah, the Knicks by 10. They suck.
Yeah, OK.
In human terms, I'd say Cybill Shepard.
All right.
Well if it helps, it worked very well.
I uhm... I completely understand.
You know what. I think this audition is over.
What?
We're closing.
Are you close with them?
Excuse me, that's 50 bucks.
Right... Goodbye Phoebe.
Yes, at 4:00.
Maybe.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, the poem is not about you.
Really?
No, I was working on my pottery.
That's very good, what's your name?
Shhh.
The dark of night has disappeared!!
I don't want to talk about it.
Why would you think that?
Hey, dragon! Here's your tips from Monday and Tuesday.
Monica? My God you used to be so. . . I mean you, you, you, you must have lost like. . . You look great.
Phoebe?
Oh, hi Rachel.
It's okay, it's not as bad as it looks, it's a precaution. Ah, I'm not supposed to move my spine.
So you're not friends with him?
Maybe, before the game we could enjoy some eight year old some small batch Basel Hadens.
Okay.
Just keep smiling.
Ohh, nice choice.
By being in a box?
Naah, I crapped out, but Mr. 21 over here he cleans up, 300 bucks, check it out he buys me these new shoes, sweet huh?
I can't believe she's really gone. Look around you, all of this is ours.
Oh, there's our stop.
What?
Pleased to meet you.
Umm, actually, I'm getting married again.
It's all right. Sweetheart.
Wait! Wait! There is the train station!
Get my glasses too.
Alright, lady, now give me your purse!
Mommy, what's wrong with that man?
Hey, Bob, it's Jade. Listen, I just wanted to tell you that I was really hurt when you didn't show up the other day, and just so you know, I ended up meeting a guy.
A mento...
Excuse me.
Yes!
Yeah... anything.
Well okay, if it means that much to you, then I'll ask him out.
Oh my God! Whoah!
Okay, here are the tips for this morning. Jen gets 50, 50 for me, and Joey owes eight dollars.
The doctor will be right with you sir.
No, no "How you doing?" Man, I mean not even a cup of coffee first!
I don't care. I am trying to get a person out of my body here, and you're not making it any easier.
Whats she doing here?
Who is this?
Three.
Me neither.
You know what your problem is? You're threatened by me.
I crushed a pill and put it in her drink... Come on, sweetheart.
OK.
Oh. Yeah. Well.. You didn't come see me when I was in the hospital when I was getting my lips done.
Ready, Annabelle?
Oh, mostly fashion, so there may be models here from time to time, I hope that's cool.
Yeah, yeah, let me show you around. This is the uh, downstairs living room.
Oh, you're so funny. Listen, umm, what are you doing after rehearsals? Do you want to get a drink, or something?
But please, let's just forget the whole thing.
Is that supposed to be funny?
It looks like we have surpassed last year's pledge total! Thank you viewers! The pledge that did it was taken by one of our volunteers... Oh boy! And may I say one of our sharpest dressed volunteers, Mr. Joseph Tribbiani!
Hey! Take these cappuccinos to table 11 and that guy over there wants the biscotti.
Well don't forget that fiches over there by Rachel.
Yeah.
I feel like I owe you an explanation. I don't ordinarily go around kissing guys at parties. I'm... well, I'm kind of embarrassed. I really hope you don't think less of me.
I'm sorry, who are you?
Santa!
Oh that would be great!
Well what is it? Come on sweetie, your like, freaking me out here.
What?
Why don't we what?
Well, you're Pennsylvania Dutch, right?
I just never would have pictured Richard with a bimbo.
Ohh, it's a bit small.
Absolutely! And when you do, make sure you ask for Brian.
...and the style number, and the invoice number, and the shipping date. Good. Any questions so far?
She's not a twinkie.
I can't help it, I'm just, I'm just crazy about you.
Oh! Oh! The usher must be right! What, with all that training they go through! Get out!! Here! Hey man, you want the aisle?
Fine.
Our last ocean view room was unacceptable to you.
Oh! That was Lambchop!
Thats unbelievable.
When?
No, that's not exactly what I was..
That's right. Mr. Ford is a very good customer, he brings us a lot of clothes; you bring us nothing!
Not really.
Sure.
Ya know, she's having another baby.
This almost never happens!
Anyway, I'm gonna go and get some rest. I'm really glad I picked you guys. You're gonna make great parents. Even Chandler.
Yeah.
Really?
See, if anyone overheard that, I didn't come off well.
I told that guy who answered your phone.
What are you doing?
Phoebe, I...
Okay, what the hell, what the hell. You want me to actually throw you or you-you wanna just hop?
Hey.
Me? I'm fine, fine. I'm glad you're here. ...What's with your hair?
I didn't ask. You wanna come in?
I'll talk to her.
I'm sorry.
So you lied to me before?
Hi.
Really Mr. Geller, you don't have to do this.
I can't believe you married him.
It did at first, but not anymore.
Uh sir, may I see your tickets please?
Nina.
But you're supposed to work on Monday.
Hello?!
I don't see any reason why I would do that to myself again.

150 pounds. Yeah, I'm gonna be in one of those Subway sandwich commercials.
Oh, no no no. I'm fine. I'm fine.
This is your daughter? I can be your new mummy!
In a moment, please, I'm in the middle of a task. And you have a customer.
Look, either you leave, or we remove you.
Hey!
That's a good one! Do you hear that Ross? Three days!
Nothing! It's an expression.
Uhh, we know, he already did it last week.
No, let me finish.
No. I'm all alone.
Yeah, you know, put chips in it, we'll make like a chip chick.
Ok, just one more point.
All right girls, and man. Let's see your final tallies. Ohhhh, Debbie, 321 boxes of cookies, Very nice.
Oh, this should be easy. I have a very wide pelvis. You remember Chandler.
You did a bad thing!
Julia..
Cheers!
No, let's just leave the lights on.
And the vet said it was time. And so from half a world away, while my Mother held the phone to his ear, I said good bye to my dog,. In seven languages.
Hey Phoebe.
CUT!
Whoa-whoa-whoa! I don't think so! Aren't you ovulating?
No, she touched mine first!
What?
I've uh, I've come to talk to Ross.
Or so I would have you believe.
No, she's a hooker.
Wow!
Sorry.
I decorated Dad's office.
That was me.
Shut up! I did not sound like that at all!
OH....MY....GAWD!!!
Hey! I'm proud of that sauce, it's delicious.
I-I-I don't think so.
I'm moving in.
I can't believe that Ross is gone. It is just so sad.
Do you know where the store is?
Well, I kinda did. Me. Eight weeks of me.
I don't care. Why, do you want me to care?
It's white!
Ewww!
Oh, what are you, stupid? It's been three hours.
You're about 80 percent effaced, so you're on your way. It still could last a little while longer. If you're anxious there are a few ways to help things along.
Go ahead. Try a piece. Yeah, we think that Mockolate is even better than chocolate.
What about shut up?
This could be Gods way of telling us to eat at home.
Look umm, I, I was, I was just caught up in the moment. That's all it was. Joey, I'm-I'm sorry you feel bad, but haven't you ever sleep with a women where it meant more to her than it did to you?
Hi!
Well, we already have one offer on it, and I think the lady upstairs is goning to make another one.
Wow Bing! Burning the midnight oil.
Yes, I am.
So, how's married life treating you?
Ow, ow, ow, ow, leg cramp, leg cramp, leg cramp.
That's right. But if you don't want to know...
What is, honey?
Well she said she had to think things over.
No, I would see you looking embarrassed because they are not on my desk!
Wow!
Yeah, y'know the license plate game?
So?
Your license please.
What does he look like?
I think you just have a cold, it's definitely not Strep.
Ohh great.
Hey!
Yeah! This feels really good.
Hey, well, in a couple of weeks I won't be able to travel.
Oh Drake, you are so talented, let me see those hands. Oh these hands, these beautiful hands, oh I could just eat them. . . but I won't.
Uh, would you take one of us?
That's right! We said your parents flipped a coin, decided to raise you as a girl, but you still had a hint of a penis.
Phoebe? Oh my god!
Yes, and come see the bird show at 4. The macaws wear hats. Well it's a lot cuter if your monkey hasn't just died.
Excuse me. Excuse me. Sweetheart! Come!
Hey!
Well, excuse me for putting a good spin on a traffic jam!
Phoebs.
Thank you so much! 'Cause I-I know I can do better!
Any luck?
Lovely, just lovely.
Stay.
Good morning.
Oh well, no harm, no foul.
I should tell you that crying women make me very uncomfortable.
Yes, you do.Yes...you do. I'm the one who doesn't have a choice because I...because I can't stop loving you.
That must have been hard.
Uh, no, not really, just that I was too young, y'know, but I don't see how I could all of the sudden be too young, 'cause I'm older than I was when we first got together.
You're not good!
Both of you?
Ten bucks a game?
Impressive.
Jack, is it all our fault? Were we bad parents?
Rachel is my girlfriend.
Bye.
Yeah...
Three.
That would work.
But if you wanna get married why didn't you say something before?
You want a piece of me, sir? Is that what your saying? You want a piece of me?
Why?
Yeah, a Pretty Huge...
Are you thinking about me? Of course you're not, but if you are, call me tonight. Okay, bye.
The other us.
Really?! That is so cool!
Woah!
Okay.
Hey, you listen.
Thanks! Do you have a coaster? I don't wanna make a ring.
No, I don't mind you touching my belly, but right now your hand is kind of blocking the part where the baby is gonna come out.
Oh!
Okay, Raymond, Joey you're up.
I don't know, could be an hour, could be three, but relax, she's doing great. So, uh, tell me, are you currently involved with anyone?
I don't think so.
Let's see what we got here. Ohh, y'know, Fonzie dated triplets.
Yeah, and neither did we. Give yourself a break.
Wow! Well, welcome back!
It's yours!
"Oh, you sick bastard!"
No! I mean he's nice.
We learned how to dance.
You're our third call tonight.
Ugh, well I will just have to soak up every once of Chandler Bing until that moment comes.
Yes! Although, I think we may be seeing a little too much of some people. Aren't you a little old to be wearing a dress like that?
Ohh, God, guys, check it out, you can see that girl's underwear!
Ursula?
Well that wasn't easy.
Well you're fingerprints were all over my badge so I just ran it through the computer and this was listed as your last known address so I just checked it out.
Uh sure.
Yes I am.
This is a hospital.
C.H.E.E.S.E. is right here.
I'm gonna take her back to the appartment.
Eric.
Ross, umm, you've been in there for a long time. I'm starting to get kinda freaked out.
Hey!
OH...MY...GAWD!!
Aaaaah!
He's says, 'Walking with you makes this strange city, feel like home.'
It's a... It's good to meet you! Thank you so much for taking the time out to show me around.
Ross, I love you!
Yeah, it happened to me once. I was just flipping through the channels and bam! It was like finding money.
That's so sweet.
Totally and completely healthy!
Oh Ross...
Oh umm, uh we don't sell cigarettes, but they have them at the newsstand across the street.
Because it's in a slightly different time zone than the kitchen.
I don't know one actor worth his salt that didn't say at one time or another, "God, I stink!" Hell, I just did a scene out there, first take, I stunk the place up. But, the important thing you must remember, no matter how badly you think you might stink, you must never, ever bust into my dressing room and use my shower! Do you understand me?!
Well, he's doing terrible!
It's nice to see you're not still wearing that denim cap with all the little mirrors on it.
Ross, I'm gonna go.
So that's two boxes of the Holiday Macaroons. On behalf of the Brown Birds of America, I salute you.
Here's the Shelly Siegal stuff from December.
Ross, you're being silly. I've tried it, it's no big deal. Just taste it.
Yeah, that-that Chandler cracks me up.
Hi!
Of course it did. They're made of wicker.
Nice to meet you.
Oh, I missed you kids. Well, should I put my coat in the bedroom?
No, really, c'mon. You're smart, you're sexy...
All right.
Oh good.
I missed you. I'm gonna get changed.
He proposed to you? This is the worst birthday ever.
I think I know who you're talking about.
Come on, touch it!
Hey.
So, see ya on Saturday.
Yeah, what are they gonna say you didn't love me anymore. Come on.
Joey? Joey Tribbiani?
It was nice to meet you Rachel.
After all, my parents died very young.
My god in heaven.
Russians! It showed them as terrorists and villains!
Right. Hey, ahh, you wanna come? Marge has a girlfriend.
Rachel!! Open up!! It's your sister!! I have to talk to you!!
Are you a paleontologist?
Are you Chandler?
What's...
Well, you said that we except the Discover Card, which we do not!
Oh no, I know that wouldn't work. My husband's in concert.
Are you kidding me?! With a cute butt like this, I'd find work.
I can help with that.
And his opponent, from Hunnington Beach, California! He's a 300 pound street fighter, Tank Abbottttttt!!!!
Oh no! Where to? Too Paris?
I'm sorry.
I'm right here!!!!
Ok, given your situation, the options with the greatest chances for success would be surrogacy, or insemination using a sperm donor.
What the hell, it's for a good cause! All right!
Minsk. It's in Russia.
HA!
Well, if I ever goto Minsk, you'd better watch out.
I love that idea!
Um, maybe 15, 16 years.
Hey.
Don't take that tone with me. All-all right you can.
Is he okay?
What? Where did you hear that?
Oh, Martha Ludwin's daughter is gonna call you. Mmm! What's that curry taste?
Sorry to bother you again, but could you pass my pamphlets back? Thank you.
Hi.
But you're not. Okay, good.
All right.
Hello all!
I know. I hate that!
Ooooohhh.
That's tough. Tough stuff. C'mon, Pheebs, we're gonna catch that movie, we gotta get going.
Ok, I have to sleep on the west side because I grew up in California and otherwise the ocean would be on the wrong side.
That was Alice's mom, she said she left five hours ago. She should be here by now!
Hi Phoebe.
Yeah, well, now you're kinda not.
Oh!
Yes, I feel that you are a little annoying.
Stay calm?!! How do you expect me to stay calm?! This is unacceptable Rachel! And I wanna know why?!! Is it because that punk Ross won't marry you?! That's it! Is that it?!
Hi. Is this your first?
Sure!
You were talking about me before! Look, I don't need this! I'm outta here! Where's my hat? Look, I've been in this business for a long time!
Yeah, sure. Good luck!
Joe, mom and dad are fine...
Okay, how about this, you guys die and the crazy plate lady dies, then do I get the baby?
Min. Oh Rach, you're still here, at our wedding, they were packing up the chopped liver about now.
That's fine, actually I'm on the hiring committee, so there'll be at least one friendly face.
Oh, sure. Yeah, well, he was my high school boyfriend. Captain of the football team, really cute and he got a scholarship and went off to college.
Ding!
Well thank you, I'll give you a tour later. It's actually three floors.
Hello, is Ross there?
Yeah, I know. I hate it too. Look, maybe we should just tell them.
Honey, relationships are hard. Like with your Mom and me. You know after we graduated college we broke up for a while. It seems her Father, your Grandfather, wanted her to travel around Europe, like he did. Of course, he got to do it on Uncle Sam's nickel, because he was also strafing German troop trains at the time. However,
Oh no, don't be silly. I just bet I'd need these.
Oh. Well uh, you not being able to talk may make this easier. Listen umm... Listen I don't wanna be someone who comes between two best friends. I just, I can't stand seeing what this is doing to you guys, and I don't wanna be the cause of that. So, I don't think we can see each other anymore. I'm gonna go to my mom's in Chicago, I'm gonna stay there for awhile. I think this could've be something really amazing, but y'know this is probably for the best. Y'know? I'm gonna miss you. Good-bye, Chandler.
Hi David. Chandler. Monica... Oh!
Welcome everybody, welcome to Amazing Discoveries!
Doctor Ross Geller.
Bye.
So uh, who's your photographer?
So, I guess you and I should talk about Jack and Ben right now.
What?
What is the great tragedy here? You go get yourself another appointment.
Yep. Pretty much.
Fight.
Presenting the award for Favorite Supporting Actress is Joey Tribbiani from Days of Our Lives.
I'm just going to say hi to the lads. All right?
Dancing on your feet! Like the other girls did it.
Okay. Oh no, I have to.
You don't observe a dance class. You dance a dance class. Spare shoes are over there.
Next on the platforms are... ...you two! And... ...You two!
Ohh, it's time to go.
Awesome!
Looks good.
If it's not a right angle, it is a wrong angle.
I've been following your career for years, I-I can't wait for your keynote speech.
Yeah, sounds like a good idea... Dr. Geller!
Rachel, one of your customers seems to have left his billfold. A Joshua Bergen.
Sweetheart. Oh sorry were late, my fault, I insisted on riding the tube.
Okay.
Huh?!
Anyway, I was wondering if, you were the sort of person who...eats lunch.
Well, we better get going, it's late. Jack's not allowed to drive at night anymore. He has trouble staying in his lane.
Okay.
Phoebe, I-I-I-umm, Oops. I just, I-I-I-I don't, I don't know what to say. I just can't believe that you're my daughter, you're so pretty.
No! It don't go up on the wall!
Okay...
Y'know, there are two people who could put your picture up there.
Peeeeeooooooooch "Hang up that phone!" One take!
If that helps you.
Because you don't want me to be happy. You.. you have always been jealous of me.
Emma.
You two know each other?
Yeah, hey.
I love you!
Hey, you've been here five years, you figure it out.
So you guys want coffees?
How you doin there squirmy?
Hey, Joey.
Yes, Waltham interiors.
Here comes the bride.
No you stop!
Now maybe you just like wanna but the whole duck in there! Who cares, y'know? Now I got the legs...
Oh, oh, I can do it for her, if you want...
Sorry. We didn't hear you; we're on our honeymoon.
Oh great! Oh, you. Umm, what's up?
Can you believe it. I've never had any professional dance training.
Lebanon.
What's TiVo?
And I'll fit you for a glass eye.
Sure.
Hi, Joey. Well well, look what you brought. Very nice.
Then why you work here?
Hi.
Take thee, Emily...
Because if you're not moving forward, y'know you're just moving backwards.
Actually, I should get going.
Joey there's a girl on the phone for you.
Alright.
Now Chandler dear, just because your father and I are getting a divorce it doesn't mean we don't love you. It just means he would rather sleep with the house-boy than me.
Why are you shopping here? You don't live in this neighborhood. Were you here waiting for me?
Twenty bucks.
Well, you got uhm... good energy.
I'm sorry sir, these are for the pharmaceutical convention.
Hi!
Okay, you're at ten centimeters. Time to start having some babies. All right, I want only the father in here please.
You're absolutely right they are writing me out of the show. They don't know exactly when it's going to happen, but apparently going to be very soon and that's it.
Ella wanted to go out, so we went shopping and got some sushi.
No. You have got it completely wrong. John Savage was deerhunter, no legs, John Voit was coming home, couldn't feel his legs.
Joey, Joey, I-I-I'll g-get you your job back if you help me out.
Do you?
I know.
Uh, no! No! That's...art! If it bothers you I can put my art out.
Cut!
Just tell me the truth.
Oh my God! There's a toe in my kitchen.
Oh, you don't have to do that every time.
I-I-I'm leaving the show?
Which bedroom do ya want it in Miss Geller?
Well, I could cut it.
Here are the boards for Friday's pitch .
I'll call the university and tell them about your relationship and have you fired.
I'll just run to the store and get some.
You are falling fast asleep. Deeper. Deeper. Deeper. You are now completely asleep. You don't need to smoke. Cigarettes don't control you. You are a strong, confident woman, who does not need to smoke. A strong, confident woman.
Yeah, his name is Ross. What?
Well, I'm sorry I brought it up. So, are either one of you planning on staying at home with your child...
Thanks a million.
I hate you!!
Oh wow, I didn't get you anything. Here's five back.
The what?
Gloves. Brown, leather dress gloves.
Well, of course.
Eee!!
Yeah, is she really 20.
What do we got here?
You were gonna propose?
On the date, I will be able to talk to her directly? See ya Friday.
Hi, hi. So.. Dreading this?
Oh, right. He is so great. But that's over.
You're doing it again.
Okay.
Well I did. I really did. And you guys, I've got to say, I'm sorry if I was a little weird after the last time we went out. I guess I was just nervous or something.
COME ON!!!!
Hey, that's weird, today's my birthday too!
No. No, I haven't seen him.
All right, there was none. Let's talk signing. You be noisy girl number one, you be noisy girl number two.
Yep.
Oh, my ex-wife didn't work, unless you call turning into her mother work. Fine. Tomorrow night then.
Hey, I went by the photo shop, take a look, here is a mockup of our card. What do you think?
He's getting married tomorrow right?
Do I dare ask?
So, what is this information worth to you, my friend?
I heard ya.
Oh that was a real person?!
Hi! What-what're you doing here?
Uh, bye Monica.
Maybe because you've got the keys?
Are you looking at her?!
Okay.
Yes?
No, I'm getting it. I'll be right back.
And...Action!
So let's talk a little bit about your duties.
Boy, bad time to say the wrong name, huh Ross?
Where are you Vic?
With them, under them, what's the difference? Eh, Rach?
We've only known each other for six weeks!
And I'm with you! What a great time to be alive! Look at this plate-bouncy thing. What an inspired solution to man's plate dispensing problems.
Boy I would just uh, I would freak out.
No, you've got to whip it.
Oh, like you don't already have everything.
Yoko. I've decided to go to Minsk without you.
...and you sand it and you varnish it...
Hi, is uh Phoebe here?
Uhh-huh.
So uh well the director is insisting that whoever play that part be authentically, anatomically not Jewish. Do you know what I'm saying?
Okay.
Say Rachel, I was wondering if you'd like to go to a movie with me sometime. As my lover! Nnnsch, to out there. Maybe you'd just like to ah, get something to eat with me sometime? As my lover.
That's alot of information to get in in thirty seconds! Alright Joey, if wanna leave, just leave. Rachel, no you weren't supposed to put beef in the trifle. It did not taste good. Phoebe, I'm sorry, but I think Jacques Cousteau is dead. Monica, why you felt you had to hide the fact that you were in an important relationship is beyond me.
How does it happen?
I am so glad that you could come over tonight.
You always said I'd make it.
Why would you serve food on such a sharp stick?
We're still rolling!
I could play the oboe!
No, no, no. What was that?
No-no-no, the kiss was good.
Sure, listen I was gonna order some pizza, you wanna share one?
None the less. Umm, you're too young to, to really know what you want.
Yeah. Ooh, and I know Gail Rosten is in there twice, but she is so...
Hey, what do you want to drink?
Oh, like I'd give up that job! Free popcorn and candy, anytime I want. I can get you free posters for your room.
All right, you have yourself a deal.
Well, it's not out here. Is there any chance it could be in your office?
Hi, this is Dick Clark, live in Times Square. We're in a virtual snowstorm of confetti here in Times Square...
I wanna see everything! Times Square, Coney Island, Rockefeller Center...
Yes I did.
Well, here we sit, devil may care, just a little while ago you were reattaching someone's spinal cord.
Yeah.
So uh Chandler, you like that badge I got you?
I will go for that drink.
Okay, Dave in the membership office, handles quitters. Uh, excuse me, are you a member?
Dr. Drake who?
And your breasts! Hmm!!!
Ew, y'know what? One time I saw this guy from behind and he seemed like a totally normal guy and then he turned around and it was Stephan Baldwin!
Here's your call sheet for tomorrow.
Ah, no it's not. I've got picture-in-picture here. Yeah. Yeah, okay. I'm gonna have to call you back later. Monica? You. I'm gonna have to call you back.
I'm sorry, really, I'm so embarrassed. Really, I'm a pretty nice guy. Just ask my parole officer...Apparently I'm not a funny guy.
Take care.
Hey.
Didn't I just throw you out of here?
...and all those dinosaur nick-knacks you have Ross, I thought they might be more at home in the garage.
I notice you picked out a lot of our dinosaur items.
Yeah, I don't know why, I'm sorry, I guess I just didn't want to lose face.
Ditto.
Alright, I gotta report you. What's your medallion number?
Hi!
Chicken? Chicken boy!
What?
Hey, you keep pushing me on this, my foots going to meet the middle of your ass.
They're all tourists.
Great! But wh-wh-How do you know where I live?
Yeah, well, uh, we're kind of a thing now.
Oh, it's crazy about Rachel huh?
Yeah, he loved stilts. One time I was upstairs, I was stealing cigarettes out of my mom's purse, and uh, all of a sudden I look over and there's my dad's head bobbing past the window. He just had this big smile on his face and he was waving 'cause he was always happiest when he was on his stilts.
You guys, the water's great. You should really go in.
Okay, let me ask you something: if what you and your wife have is so great, then why are you spending Christmas with me?
I mean, there's a statue in Minsk...
No. This is my red sweater.
Yeah, the list that-of people we're allowed to sleep...
Well, we're starving, why don't we all go get something to eat?
It's so great seeing you guys again. I'd like to make a toast. Uh, as a poet once said, "In the sweetness of friendship, let there be laughter and sharing of pleasures for in the due of little things the heart finds it's morning and is refreshed."
I probably should've just left years ago when the offers were pouring in, but y'know I just got so comfy here! And... Ohh, I turned down some amazing work!
Yeah well, being that he was the victim, they're usually pretty talkative.
Great. I'll see you later!
Mom, dad, this is Phoebe. Phoebe, these are my parents: Theodore and Bitsy.
So...
Good evening.
Honey, relax. Ross is great with him. Don't look so surprised. I'm a lovely person.
I thought it was ok when you slept with your old assistant Tag.
Oh, my, god.
Yeah, come on in.
Fine, whatever.
Nope.
Hi.
Oh my God, I'm late.
Well, you kids take the train in?
Oh, sure. Now. But what happens when he meets somebody else and gets married?
Honey.
You know, I rarely connect with someone this much on the first date.
Doctor Geller, I'm such a huge fan!
Uh-huh! Let me ask you something?
Bye.
This is just so exciting. You know, I never worked. I went straight from my father's house to the sorority house to my husband's house. I am just so proud of you.
Joey, onstage!
We'll do a quick check.
I'll make it a hundred!
Well then here's the deal, you won't have to so long as never ever show your faces in this coffee house ever again.
Hey, hey!
Oh, well, I'll show you around.
Come on.
I don't think so dear.
I know! I haven't even read them the specials yet!
You've sung Happy Birthday to 20 different women today!
Oh Drake.
So once they caught on to the fact that we're, y'know, short and have breasts...
Y'know, you look nothing like I would've thought. You're...you're so young.
I think I may be able to book The Plaza on short notice.
Hola, it's me, yesterday was really fun. Call me about this weekend, okay.
Okay! See you later!
Huh. That's nice.
Can we at least try living together? I mean you might change your mind about marriage.
Yes.
Ok, all right, well aren't there times when you come home at the end of the day, and you're just like, 'if I see one more cup of coffee'...
Hi Chandler!
Hi.
Oh, well, we can go see the Chronos Quartet at the Avery Fisher Hall.
It's clean.
That's fine. Well, your other dad and I are gonna go have a romantic evening and I guess I'll just see you kids around.
You mean like watch?
Oh, shut up. You know, it's a rebuilding year. You... waah!
God, this was really fun! I've been wondering if you were going to ask me out.
Could you pull open the curtains for me? The astronauts from the space shuttle are gonna be on the news, and since we don't have a TV, the lady across the alley said she'd push hers up to a window, so I could watch it.
It's all right. It's all right. You don't have to explain. This isn't the first boyfriend bonfire that we've seen get out of control.
Rachel and I had a really big fight, can I come in? I-I mean I know we're not supposed to see each other anymore and I'm okay with that, it's just that I don't know anybody in the city and I really need somebody to talk to about it.
That's funny. Who are they?
Ohh, I'm sorry.
You are not going to regret this.
Yeah!
It's us.
Hey!
Actually yeah, that'll be great.
Yeah.
Ohhh.
Hello.
Wow. I'm sorry. Eggroll?
So um, is there a phone here, I can check my messages?
We'll get to the wax in a minute. First I want to tweeze some of the strays, ok? This may sting just a little bit...
Uhm... no. Although I did have an uncle who voted for Dukakis.
Hey! Am I late? Am I late? Nobody came out yet, right?
Except stilts.
...emblem of the land I love. The home of....
Is it really your fa--I can't... well of course it is.
Yeah, for you. Is that the list?
Take your shirt off, and let's see what we're dealing with here. What are you doing?
We'll see you, guys!
What's he talking about?
Joey says you don't really like his hat, but I think it's kinda dashing.
You tell her Jack, I can't do it.
No, I really did forget my purse.
Is he really?
Yeah, I heard it.
Uh-oh-okay. Uh-oh-okay. I know what you all are thinking. But Chandler is in Yemen! I'm a young woman! I have needs! I can't wait forever!
I'm not sure I know what you're getting at.
You said two weeks.
Ohhh, you're having a parteee.
Sorry, members only.
Oh God! You see, that's what I was afraid of!
Oh, I'm sorry. Lisa, Monica, Chandler. We used to date.
Oooh it's getting close!
Oh, I thought I heard you.
No, I can't.
Yeah, well..
It's okay, it's okay, I'm here, I'm here. Sorry I'm late, okay, here I am. Who's the new tense girl?
Yes, because that's how long it takes to love me.
Look Phoebe, It's not about you. I just never wanna get married again.
Yeah, it was.
Oh my God!
It's been so long! Last time I saw you, you were setting up your tent in line to see Return of the Jedi.
Can I get you some coffee?
You in the back, you're getting it all wrong!
I left a bra drying on the shower rod, you don't think your son will think it's yours and be horribly traumatised?
Take it easy.
Listen to me!
... all these coasts having beautiful weather. In New York, it's 72 and sunny!
Um, leave.
So you still think you, um... might want that fifth date?
Do I know why we're rushing?
I do. You didn't love Barry. And I've never seen you this happy. I look at you and I think, oh, this is what I want.
Well I actually, I-I really, I haven't seen her for years. But umm, well I-I was pretty tight with-with her and her daughter.
No, no, there's no rush or anything.
Oh, you're so lucky. My fiancee wants the heavy metal band Carcass.
Wow! This place is beautiful!
I'm a party planner. I'll see you tomorrow.
How-how I like to melt stuff, and how I dislike stuff that doesn't melt.
You did!
Yes, Waltham interiors.
Uh-oh!
So is there like a story or do they just stard doing it right. . . oh, never mind.
Well, welcome to the Winner Circle. Joey and Gene, you guys ready?
Toby!
Hey Rachel!
Breakfast is near!
Then y'haven't. You're burning your tomatoes.
I love you, love you.
You're so welcome.
I read a lot.
Wow. Well being a huge Knicks fan myself, I think you should take someone who's a huge Knicks fan.
Phoebe, I have spent the last eight months in a steel tube with men, thinking about this moment. I am not gonna let a bunch of itchy spots stand between us.
You wanna know why. You wanna know why?
I'm sorry?
Cute assistant! What's his story? Is he...
Can't complain.
He's a keeper. How are you feeling?
Why?
The baby's head is crowning.
Oh yeah we do. C'mon.
Oh God! Here we go again. Why does this keep happening to me? Is it something I'm putting out there? Is this my fault? Or am I just nuts?
This kitty is Mittens and this one is Fitzhugh, and this little guy in the cat condo is Jinkies.
O-kay!
Gotcha.
Where's the 1920s princess cut ring.
So, what's up?
I thought it was toner.
You can watch our tape if you want.
Well, yes! Just give me five minutes, I just have to find someone to cover my shift.
Mmmh, those fries look delicious.
Um, would you like to come in?
No, he's in prison.
Oh, no thanks.
Buffay, are you going to plunge your stake into my dark places?

That's interesting! Just one thought: You didn't mention the shoes. Who's next? Chander.
Would you mind doing a picture with us?
Oh, thanks.
So...? What do you think?
So... how many guys have your key?
Oh boy, I just love to sing!
Where are we?
Where's your baby?
Yeah.
Apparently your brain transplant was not entirely successful. It seems your body is rejecting Jessica's brain.
And Action!
We went through the same thing when we were adopting.
Next.
Hi, Phoe.
Of course. I'll always be your dad.
I'm sorry, I never had 'em.
Oh right. All right, it's no fat, it's no sugar, it's no dairy...it's no good. Throw it out.
Why would you say that?
When I'm in a relationship, I love having a girlfriend.
Listen, I-I-I don't come to this city much so I don't know if you're crazy or this is some kind of street theater, but could I have my keys.
hey wait wait wait wait wait! Is that true what you said Phoebe's never had a serious relationship?
Why do have a picture of Paulette in your pack?!
I believe you know my husband.
Okay.
Ew.
Oh damnit!
your welcome again, I'm gonna make some coffee can I get you anything?
Nina Bookbinder is here to see you.
Hi!
I am not going to apologize to a tree!
YESSSSS!!!!! We got a baby boy!!
My kid's in a play right now.
Hello, Joey, our little matchmaker. I could just kiss you all over, and I'm gonna!
Hey, Chandler! What are you doing here?
Okay, she was here, but she left.
You don't wanna know.
Oh, she just graduated, and she wants to be something in cooking, or food, or.... I don't know. Anyway, I told her you had a restaurant-
Each.
She's fine. She's experiencing Braxton-Hicks contractions, mild discomfort caused by contractions in the uterine wall.
We must go now, quickly, please.
Ross, we can solve this. I just heard your speech. We can recreate it! We've got all night!
My late husband gave me that lighter. I'm not kidding.
Ah, excuse me, are you Rachel Green?
I intend to marry her.
A ten speed bike. But, I'd rather have something my Dad couldn't sell.
What?
I have a family, I'm gonna be here.
Yes.
Please.
Flowers, liquor, recarpet first floor. New guest bath, landscaping. I'm paying to remodel this guys house. I'm going to give that son on a bitch, a piece of my mind.
Oh then you know each other.
Just seeing her brought it all back. All the lies, the way she used me. I just...I got so angry just looking at her......face.
Well, you might try accidentally breaking something valuable of hers, say her-
Hey Joe, you ever think about joining the force? We could use a guy like you.
Well, you don't have that much time to relax. The other one will be along in a minute.
Oh don't worry, I'm not really a party girl.
Hi!
Oh, it wasn't just me. We had a club!
Ohh!
$4.50 please.
Well you're only two centimeters dilated and we need to get to ten. It'll be a while.
Joey, look at me, look at me. Do I have lipstick on my teeth?
But, I mean, you have met... humans before, right? Look, why don't you go talk to my mom?
...has become the penicillin of the twenty-first century. And so today, this hospital is about to take major steps toward leading that revolution. It is truly ironic, on one hand consider the size...
Great!
Yeah.
Oh I think it's best that I speak first.
Hello, Mr. Bing.
Hey hey, come on in!
Hum, so, I started to say you something earlier, hum... There was another reason I realized it was time to end it with Joey. I kind of realized I... was starting to have feelings... for someone else.
Bing! Read your Computech proposal, a real homerun. Ooh. Barely got ya that time, get over here. Come on. Wham! Good one. That was a good one. Keep at it team.
Wait that's-that's, what that's not what you do?
Here's your scone.
Well, the garage flooded sweetie and it ruined everything in your boxes. I'm sorry.
Good.
Hi! Rachel Green's office.
Oh. Oh I just cannot believe Clark stood me up!
But pleasure is important, and it helps if the woman has an orgasm. You up to the task sailor?
Even if he were... cornered?
More wine, dear?
What'd you do, dip it in sugar?
Alright, but after this I want to see you outside. If the rain stops.
I think you'll like it, it has two out of the three tenors.
Good morning Rachel.
Sure.
Bye!
I'm close. I'm cheap. I'm the king.
Where's Buddy?
Huh, could you imagine. I go away for a few days, and come back, and my boyfriend is living with some woman he got pregnant!
What's going on over here?
I saw Richard.
Yeah.
Noo!!
Hey Joey.
Um-hmm.
We did?
It does sound appealing.
Maybe he's intimated by really smart, strong, successful women.
What?!
What'd he say?
The woman I love... I love you... Which is probably something I shouldn't say for the first time in front of my parents... and Tom and Sue...Who are by the way the most sinfully boring I've ever met in my life...
Phoebe, why don't you come in the living room and meet our friends?
Oh that one is available now, but only identical twins are eligible. It's a twins study.
Yes.
Oh, no. Oh, no.
We can't scratch. You know we can't, we'll scar.
No, the man is a mess.
I'm sorry Joey that's...that's the way it is.
Hi, I am Laura, I am here for your adoption interview.
It's Petty. I'll be right back with your ticket.
I think it's sweet.
Do you have a sec?
Damnit!
Hey.
Okay.
Okay.
Oh, y'know what? Forget it, you already gave me an A.
Kidding! God, I feel wild today!
18th and East End.
I packed while you were gone. I left some knickers under your pillow.
Did I, uh, did I miss something?
It's a bathing suit?
Then, can I have your number?
They say he's only got half a tank left.
Breathe, breathe, breathe.
No. But it's okay, I'll just put out pickles or something.
He's the kind of guy you're friends with, y'know? But he's not the kind of guy you date. He's the kind of guy you'd date because you did. Me, not so much.
Although, I have enjoyed the fact that, uh your shirt's been stickin' outta your zipper ever since you came back from the bathroom.
Yeah? Well you still shoulda told me.
Oh, hi. It's Mark.
They-they-they can smell fear.
Hi!
Yes! Phoebe.
I, I really have to be somewhere but it was nice meeting you.
Well, actually the last time you and I saw each other was that morning.
What's different?
What?
What? You... You... Oh! Can I ask you a personal question? Ho-how do you shave your beard so close?
There you are! Haaah, you got away from me!
Can we talk to you for just a y'know... It's just a little thing. Well we think it's absolutely marvelous that you're having this baby out of wedlock, some of our friends are less open-minded. Which is why we've told them all that you're married.
Peel the onion. First of all, he's good looking.
I - I just have to say this; you're really beautiful.
Ohh, no. Ugh. Oh, leaving London, my whole family lives there.
Absolutely! Or maybe just a little less pimp spit.
Hi. I'm here for Ross Geller's memorial service.
Oh?
Oh! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Yes! Thank you!
Actually its, Vatican City. Now ahh, what do you know about vulcanised rubber?
Oh, please darling, let's be honest. You can have all the... sailor fun you want with that one, but... let's be real...
Thank you.
I wish I could.
Oh! My number is on there. Give me a call.
Well, I gotta tell ya Bing; that partner of yours is a real tiger. Are you all right sweethart?

Rachel didn't you just light that?
Whaddyou want?
Hi Ben!
Wait a minute, you don't have renter's insurance?!
No!! Cover it up!!
Good morning!
You should be careful when checking your overhead bins, 'cause items may shift during...
Hey you guys, umm do either one of you want to get in there before I take my bath.
Oh, Ross, listen to me. I have sold a hundred million copies of my books, and y'know why?
I studied for a year in Barcelona.
Stop!
You're next!!
Hey! Hi!
Where are we?
Hey!
Don't, I like it dirty.
Well, I was thinking, why doesn't he give Monica a call?
You're good. You're good!
Excuse me.
That-that's him! You know him?
Mockolate. It's a completely synthetic chocolate substitute.
When the Cretaceous period ended, the dinosaurs were gone.
That's great!
Hey! Hey! This is ah, my fiance, Mrs. Knight.
The guy that's about to kick your ass talks like that.
Oh, isn't it exciting, I mean it's like having a boyfriend for life.
And by you.
Boy, somebody's gonna get a big fruit basket tomorrow.
Why would we be freaked?
But you know what might really cheer me up?
1...2...
Over a month.
He told me! And he paid me 50 dollars not to tell.
Hey!
Screw you, Mike. You're a coward and a bastard, and I hope you rot in hell.
Phoebe you're so beautiful. You're so kind, you're so generous. You're so wonderfully weird. Every day with you is an adventure, and I can't believe how lucky I am, and I can't wait to share my life with you forever.
Well, then who's been dead for five years?
Hi!
What kinda noise?
Acting! Chandler, this is my job! I'm-I'm playing a part in a play! How can you not trust me?!
Then you gotta let them go.
Do sit down.
Your turn.
Oh look at you! So handsome!
Yeah, and I have a time share in the Pocanos with Flipper.
OH! OWWWWW!
The guys across the hall are throwing water balloons at us.
Thanks for coming you guys.
I'm Rhonda, and these aren't real!
Yeah.
Oh right, that Rachel chick from the coffee place.
I know. I was sweepin' yesterday. It coulda been me.
So, how's everything going in here?
Hi.
So you like the short hair better.
What's the matter? Are you upset?
And you knew about this?!
Yeah, I guess. Look, what are we gonna do about this scene, huh?
Ok.
What's a nubbin?
Hey, hold on a second.
It's just that I uh, have been working for ten years now at this meaningless, dead-end job and nobody here even knows I exist!
No, none at all. You need to be happy with whoever is in your home... Although if you don't mind telling me, what was your problem? Maybe it's something I can work on in the future.
Well, we've gotta go.
Tramp?!
Yeah, we figure it'll live with Ross half the time, and with me half the time.
I can promise not to tell her again.
Thanks for dinner last night.
That would be great! Also, uh, I was hoping to catch a show so if you can make any suggestions...
Maybe.
Someone does. Me.
Well, anyway, I hope we can be friends.
You-you work at one of those massage parlors?
Goodbye.
Oh.
Any painful gas?
Really?
Oh, I'll-I'll be fine. Just God I hate her Ross! I hate her!
Oh, actually I sorta have plans.
What?
That's it.
Oh my God!
You okay there, slugger?
My God what a fantastically well lit hallway!
Oh hey! Good, you're both here.
It's awfully pink.
Cut! That was good. That was very good. You did everything I asked for.
Do you want to know?
Great! I'm looking forward to it. Rachel, any messages?
No!
We do five because that gives you a 25% chance that at least one will attach.
But you should probably talk to my roommate, because I told him and he knows Phoebe too.
Amen!
Absolutely.
What's Ross doing to you on that picture?
I think we'd better start again. Ross, repeat after me. I, Ross...
Hi!
You too.
It's a good play, isn't it?
But...
You asked him too?!
Yes he was.
Sweetheart, you obviously have a problem. You've chosen a boyfriend exactly like your father.
Who-who else is in vice up there?
Go! Come on! Roll!
Breathe, breathe, breathe...
I am Guru Saj.
I am so stupid. Of course she was lying! She's not a teacher. There's not such a thing as the top secret elementary school for the children of spies.
That's great! I'm sorry. It's just... such an emotional thing when you're welcomed into a new family...
It looks like one of her eyebrows fell down. Now unless someone convinces her to let me bleach it, Jean-Claude Van Damme is gonna be making out with Gabe Kaplan.
Wait, just a second.
All right. I'll get my bag.
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Awww!
Oh Jack stop.
What do you mean, your seat?
Uhh....
Why?
Ok.
Hi.
Hey, do you mind? We're under cover here.
Hey! Hey! No rough holding in my ER!
Rach! Come on! Rach!
Uh.. To name a few. You know.. You know.. You've just always been like this. You just have to have everything. And I couldn't have anything. Like in junior high, when you stole Timmy from me. I mean, do you even realize how much that hurt me?
I was gonna say...
You're gonna keep an eye on us?
Well all right, one thing happened?
Hey. Listen, I want you to know how sorry I am...
The one in the director's chair.
Ok Henrietta, you've picked Jack and Jill went up the hill.
I know a guy who's the 18th.
Yes, what's the name, please?
That's good, that's good. So, so, so who broke up with who?
Uh-huh.
Well, goodbye Chandler. I had a great blackout. See ya.
And anyhow, I'm sorry I was so harsh before, but you have to understand that I still look at Lizzie like she's a twelve-year-old girl.
What?!
Huh. Oh, boy! Uhh, I-I don't wear suits to work, and I bought six of them from you.
So what did he decide? Does your Uncle Nathan get an invite or not?
Is that supportive?
Wow, uh, anything else I should know?
No, please.
I don't know man, we're really not supposed to do that.
Oh. And Rachel has been really incredible in getting my morning bagel for me. It's amazing how she gets it right almost every time!
So are you his mother or his father?
Oh hey, great, you're up. Rachel, this is my sister Krista. Krista, this is Rachel.
You know, you were right? I mean, I thought we were happy. We weren't happy. But with Mindy, now I'm happy. Spit.
Actually, they're things you can do. Just some home remedies, but in my experience I've found that some of them are quite effective.
Y'know what? That's okay, you guys have ordered so many that this one is on me!
Oh God help me.
Oh yes of course, hello Chandler.
Oh John! Great!
Rachel, I made you a cocoa.
Oh, I know, I know. I've just been crazed.
Can I go next?
Fine.
No-no-no, do you uh light candles? Burn incense?
You've never turned?
Ehhhh... B-Buttons.
So I was wondering....
Well who would?
Oh my God, does she really thinks that?
You're wild, aren't ya?
There's an open call for Cats. I'm thinking we go down there, sing Memories and make complete fools of ourselves. Whaddya say?
Uhh, I won't take no for an answer.
I meant with my son.
I have no idea what you're talking about. But I, but I just got Phoebe Buffay's autograph!
Hey! Are you ready to try nursing again?
Stop it!
Yeah. I'm Stephanie.
Want us to go?
Sooo, Richard's shopping in the junior section.
You've spoiled everything! It's like a nightmare! My friends and family are out there! How can I face them?! How can you do this to me?!
Okay, good. Thank you. I'll be back shortly, all right?
Oh! Hey well listen, I play a scientist on "Days". And my character has just won the Nobel prize. Joey: Hey Ross, listen, Dirk was wondering about the woman that you brought and if you guys were together, or...
So what do you do?
Ahh, I just got out of a big relationship, I'm not looking for any thing serious.
Well if you're asking me to quit, then you're asking me to be someone I'm not. I've got to do this.
Where did they go?
Well that's ambitious.
I'm not giving concert tickets to someone who'd use their son like this!
And you're still married to him?
No!!! Ah!! Ahh!!!
I thought of a thing.
"Monica, it's Richard. Call me."
Out!
Professor Geller?
Let go!
Umm, Frank Buffay.
Excuse me, I'm standing right here!
Oh! Yeah!
Hard day huh? First the medical award, this.
Hey. Hi Phoebe.
Ok... so... Goodbye.
No, it really should be burgundy.
Good-bye.
No he's not! He's totally yanking your chain! He's done this with three other teachers!
One meal! That's all I'm asking for. Please? We go out, we eat, and if you don't have a good time, I give you ten grand, we call it even.
Yeah, Merry... Christmas.
No, but it'll be OK, they're pretty cool, my brother's straight so. . .
You know, you're a really great listener. Most guys I go out with, they just talk and talk.
Me too.
Everybody has to audition.
That's great! That's great! I-I'll propose to her!
Ah, oh, the ah, vandalism.
Wh..
So hum...Why did I have to hide?
Sorry, what?
Well, if you want, you can work here.
Yes!
Oh-no-no-no-no....
Well if you where ever enter the Loire valley let me know, I've got a great little villa you can stay at.
You know, nothing makes God happier than when two people, any two people, come together in love. Friends, family, we're gathered here today to join Carol and Susan in holy matrimony.
So last I heard you were gonna get married. Oh poor Ray-ray.
Yeah.
No, I'll be fine... I just should check the stitches...
I...I don't care about fashion! I'm pregnant! And I know you are too, so you gotta help me!
Macaroni and cheese! We gotta make this!
Rachel?
Oh, I wish. Look, honey, you have that report to finish, and I gotta go see my lawyer.
Just for a coupla days. I got a job midtown. I figure I'm better off staying with the kid than hauling my ass back and forth on the ferry. I don't know this one.
Jeez, thank you really that is so nice. But um, to be honest, I don't think I can wear these, they're so tight, I feel like I'm on display. I'm sorry.
Your not doing it.
Get out.
Jack? I hate him! He's a jerk.
Ugh! I cannot believe you did this too me! You had me doubting how smart I was! You had me doubting my fashion sense!
Uh, Phoebe, uh... you're an amazing woman, and the time we spent apart was, was unbearable. Of course the sanitation strikes in Minsk didn't help!
No I'm not.
Bing my boy, we're gonna get you over this. Now here's the plan, grab your coat, we're going to a strip club.
Well, here it is.
Yeah, sure.
No I'm here to take Emma to your mother's, remember?
The game is over, we eat now?
Rachel, I see you've met Gavin. I must say, when you left us we weren't sure what we were gonna do. But then, Gavin to the rescue. Super Gavin!
Is this true?
What?! I can't believe you're trying to stifle me! When just 14 hours ago we figured out that that is exactly what my mother was trying to do to me!
Yeah Ross it's okay, it's me, Mr. Stevens.
Done it. I'll be back in a couple of hours.
Hi Joey.
Ross, sweetheart!
So, so, did you hear?
You crossed the line. Joey, describe for Gene these things that have lines. Give me 20 seconds on the clock, please. Ready, go!
My marriage like just ended, and I'm really not ready to get into anything yet.
I'm sorry. Are you ok with that? Cause if not...maybe us moving in together isn't the best idea.
Well someone does.
C'mon. Let her. Yeah.
...of course you can kick his ass son.
How hot are we?
No, she's at a faculty meeting.
Hey, I forgot my scarf.
Oh my God, I can't believe you're here!
It's uh, 27 dollars even.
I see. I guess you never really know whats goin on inside a persons head.
Oh, yeah. Oh, you know, that's too bad that didn't work out.
They prefer it if I don't barter.
Well okay, I'll swing by later. Do you live in this building?
Listen, um about the hair straightener, honey.. I really need one. I'm going to have dinner at my boyfriend's house.
Oh, we're not together.
I really don't think it's a very good idea, Phoebe.
Okay.
Well thanks.
If you didn't have your shirt tucked into them.
That's good. Very good!
Yeah, I-I'm taking pledges here, eh?
You must really like... Joey... to go to all that trouble for him.
Okay. Bye.
I'm not a temp. I was transferred here from another department.
So you knocked her up but you're not gonna marry her. Dude! Anybody?
No, no, I don't want to forget it.
Actually, I'm here about the assistant job.
But I don't want this to end.
More of Grandma's teramisu.
Thanks for letting me stay here! I mean Monica's place was nice, but her fiancee sure stares a lot.
Hi. Okay, will that be all?
So, the essence of the character is rooted in her confidence. So, when Jessica enters a room for instance, she owns everything and every person in that room. You try.
Well y'know, he's got access.
Really?
I wasn't checking her out. I'm in fashion, I was looking at her skirt. Or was it pants? I didn't really see what happened below the ass area.
What's going on Bing? Does uh, your wife have a problem with me or something?
Hi, I'm Lisa.
Well, look - it's not my fault if you're too uptight to appreciate the male form in all it's glory.
I knew it, wow!!
Pete Becker is circling the ring now. It looks like, he's just trying to feel him out. Oh, Bruiser is just...
I am afraid you are gonna have to take a seat.
On behalf of the Children of New York, I reject your money.
Alright!
What?
I don't know. I don't know what I'm gonna do. I just- you decide.
Me too.
How are we gonna get out of that one?
Well, uh, when Joey gave it to me, he said, "This is 'cause I know ya like Rabbits, and I know ya like cheese." Thanks. I love it. And I know how hard it must have been for you to find.
Well, if you see him, tell him to pack his bags. We are going to Minsk.
Yeah, well, it scares me! I mean I not even divorced yet, Chandler. You know, you just invited me over here for pasta, and all of the sudden you're talking about moving in together. And, and I wasn't even that hungry. You know what, it's getting a little late, and I-I should just, um...
Well, it should be. I'm gonna help babies learn how to accessorize, what colors to wear, what clothes are slimming...
Now, remember, nobody else drives that cab.
Oh that'd be great. Sure!
Look come on, eh, just ah, just ah, put your arms around me, eh.
Y'know what? Strike that. My name uh, actually is-is Joe. Uh, Joe umm, Hill.
Seafood platter for the gentleman and extra fries. Enjoy!
Above all, even though your chances of conceiving through natural means aren't great, you never know! So, keep having sex on a regular basis.
That he wouldn't pay for my lawyer! Then he told me to come here and learn about the value of money from the one daughter he's actually proud off.
Hey Joey.
Rachel, this is my friend Tom. This is the girl I told you about.
Yeah. Maybe it's for the best. You smell just like her.
Me? I'm fine. Look, honey, in an ideal world, there'd be no her, and your father would look like Sting. And I'll tell you something else. Ever since that poodle-stuffer came along, he's been so ashamed of himself that he's been more attentive, he's been more loving... I mean, it's like every day's our anniversary.
Me too.
...we talked through most of the night and we realized that the reason we were so angry at each other was because there are still feelings there. So...
Yeah, yeah, maybe.
Hi!
Hi!
All right.
Oh wow, look at this nice deep hole I've been digging. Hey Bert, isn't this a nice hole here. Hey.
Oh my God. I think you're right.
Joey, I am scared to death about this. But I really think I can do it, I'm just gonna need some help. And Bobby's gonna be here the whole time.
Yes.
You know, ever since I was little, I've been able to pick up quarters with my toes.
Thank you, Max. Thank you.
Where?
Marc Coreger, this is my wife Julie.
Ross! Wait!
As I recall when we got married, I saw the groom in the wedding dress.
You're straight. I get it.
Ok listen, you guys have shown a lot of interest in me tonight and I'm flattered and... and quite frankly a little frightened. Can we just talk about something else?
Would you mind spending some time on my siadic area, it's been killing me today.
Alright, blonde girl, you're in room two, not so blonde girl, you're with me.
Dahaaa! I'm going to find the men's room, be right back.
You'd do that for us?
How did you know there was a but?
So who are you?
Hey Chandler.
Well! Well! Well! Joey Tribbiani! So you came back huh? They think they can do better but they all come crawling back to Estelle!
Marcel?
Ah, cool! Taco shells! You know, these are... they're like a little corn envelope.
Hi!
So it seems like you have a lot of friends, who would you say is your best friend?
Congratulations!
Hello?
I'm a commodities broker.
My god, what happened?
Okay. All right uh, Alex now when Joey says his line, "Take good care of your Momma son," that's your cue to cry. Got it? All right, let's do this.
I'm sorry. Ex-excuse us. I'm sorry, it's a little crowded. Do you mind if we...
Oh. They don't.
I'll check the kitchen floors.
I didn't even have a chance to act as though I'm okay with it!
Because I-I like you.
I don't like you going out with my daughter Ross.
Oh, I cannot believe he's using our divorce to sell mattresses.
I think you should give him your star.
There's no way he smells, he's the only one around here with a shower in his dressing room.
HA!
Wait a minute, his name is Dr. Bobby?
I'd love to, but my lawyer said I can't do that anymore.
That's what real actors do! Annunciation is the mark of a good actor! And when you enunciate, you spit!
What?
Hi!
Oh, wow! Yay! Wow! Hooray! Oh, man!
Look, I'm gonna get better. Okay? I promise you.
No... he killed his father with a shovel. But other than that, he's a great guy.
I may have borrowed this from my nephew, but let me assure you, what's underneath ... is all man.
Really? I'm a hero.
So how did everything go?
Can-can I get your autograph, I'm your biggest fan.
No no no.
You seek me out. Something deep in your soul calls out to me like a foghorn. Janice, Janice. You want me. You need me. You can't live without me. And you know it. You just don't know you know it. See ya.
Let me get this straight man, you attacked your ex-wife?!
Not as impressive as you. I gotta tell you, I looked at your record and you've done some pretty weird stuff.
Oh, that's great.
Y'know I really want to move this relationship forward.
Ooh, that accident must have been terrible. You look positively ghastly.
What? Oh my God, there's really money in here.
Keep the change. Sure you don't wanna pretzel?
This may surprise you, but re-hiring fired employees, is not my main job.
I'll survive.
Aww, like I could hurt you. Are you making fun of my size? Don't make fun of me because of my size!
Oh! Great! So how much does it pay?
Not on purpose, he ricocheted of you and got me.
Stopping you from marrying the wrong man and making the biggest mistake of your life.
How you doin'?
You! Chuckles! What's your name?
My name is Precious.
Oh no. I feel it isn't really anybody's business, y'know.
I'm Irish.
Now if you were two involved in a serious relationship, that really creates a problem.
I would have told him to do it too.
You've seen all the movies...
Ross!
So? I mean have you thought about it?
You told me you didn't see anything.
Thanks for going along with this.
No-no, I heard what you said, funny. I like funny. This team is about hard work, but it's also about having fun. Good to have you aboard Bing!
So beautiful.
Hey, I wonder if you can see my apartment from up here.
Pass!
Oh, somebody's been doing his buns of steel video.
What is wrong now?!
Carol, not me.
It's Eddie you freak, your roommate.
No one's ever thrown me a surprise party before!
Yeah, well, I had a great time with you.. I just can't stand your friends.
You okay? You all right?
Hey, there's Phoebe! Is that Mike she's with?
Oh my God!
Please... go! Just let me know if you need a hand!
I'm telling you Rachel, listen to Janice. They all say they're gonna be there until they start their real family.
I played Smelly Cat for the people at my old ad agency, they went nuts.
You guys make me fly! High! Okay, we're gonna pick it up here, tomorrow.
Hot coffee!!! You idiot!! You were gonna spill hot coffee all over me, huh?!! What are you just some big, dumb, stupid, doofy idiot, with a doofy idiot hairdo, huh?! Huh?!
