Yeah, I got my speech!
What?
What's wrong buddy?
Hey, don't get mad at us! No one forced you to raise the stakes!
You said you didn't want to go.
How come those?
Damnit! Is there no mystery left in romance anymore!?
Okay.
Ahhh! My ah, my agent said it wasn't a dancing part.
Goodnight.
Hey! I made that for her!
So the ah, play's pretty great, huh?
I'm not wrong! I wish I was. I'm sorry. Bet that barium enema doesn't sound so bad now, huh?
Yeah. He's gonna keep cheating on my ma like she wanted, she's gonna keep pretending she doesn't know even though she does, and my little sister Tina can't see her husband any more because he got a restraining order...which has nothing to do with anything except that I found out today.
Is he gonna be ok?
You don't kiss your friend's mom! Sisters are okay, maybe a hot-lookin' aunt... but not a mom, never a mom!
They do!
Great...Great...and thanks for being so understanding. I mean, I didn't want to make a big deal out of this, you know. You could, uh, put the picture of the famous baby in my room. I mean, if you want to.
No, no, no I need a good lie to explain why I wasn't at a work thing today.
I ran!!
Stupid Jane Rogers!!
Rachel stuff.
Woah, hey, yo.
Yeah!!
No he doesn't!
Not good, no. I didn't get the part, and I lost my job here, so ...
No, can we get back to me?
You said, you wanna come in for some lemonade?
Wow. That's almost as much as a new book.
Well Ross, what did you think she was gonna do?
Oh... you got yourself a very weird deal!
Rach?
Yeah, where the hell is he?
Rachel... let's be clear on this, ok? I do not love Hugsy. I like him a normal amount...
That one will.
Me?
Well, I like it. Here you go.
Oh no-no, no for I second there I counted six fingers, but one was from the other hand so we're good.
Hey! Don't worry about it! It was fine! I ended up having the best time with Rachel! I just felt bad for you, stuck in that room, working on Ross's speech...
What do you mean? Rach, don't I seem like a professor you'd buy some kind of e-crap from?
Yeah.
Nope, got it and I got yours too.
Okay.
Hey Pheebs!
Can you believe they're still not here?
Dude-dude-dude!
Yeah, he's just really great to hang around with.
Hey.
Well, the duck...
Well, actually it...
Really? Do you not know Chandler?
Ooh, I was gonna say bologna, but that's much better. How about a little of that smoked turkey?
Well, there was that one time that Monica and Rachel got together.
No hey Rach, it's cool okay? Y'know I'm a loner too! Right?
You said I had to give you the chair, you didn't say anything about the cushions.
What!? But I already bought my ticket to Bermuda!
All right, so we should go catch our movie.
Yeah!
Uh-huh.
Okay.
Oh, what's wrong?
Nope.
Sa-sa-saw!
Hey, hey. How was the first day?
Relax okay, I-I-I can get this open. Anybody have a coat hanger?
If I can't have it you can't have it!
Okay, you picked the Gimmie card! You get all of Ross's points!
Well, you know Chandler.
Okay.
Okay, I got it! This place makes the best sandwich in the world!
Strip joint! C'mon, you're single! Have some hormones!
See, now it's weird again.
That tone will not make me go any faster.
Here, I got five, I got five.
Oh, ah- the kid has it.
ALL FOOD!
Heeey!
Ha-ha, very funny-Look! I don't know what to do! I really want you guys to get along. Just please come to the movie with us. I mean you owe me!
Alright look, that's it. I don't think we should see each other anymore, alright. Look, I know I should have told you this a long time ago but I am not Drake Remore, OK. I'm not even a doctor, I'm an actor. I just pretend to be a doctor.
Joseph Stalin. I think you'd remember that!
Woah, woah, woah, uh, no Shannon Cooper.
I may have to, I hate to do it, but I'm the star! Y'know? There's a limit to how many sandwiches I can eat off the floor. Excuse me. Joey Tribbiani.
Look, do you want the ring or not?!
Hey.
"Where'd you grow up," it's so simple!
My mom will.
And deaf!
Hit me.
Y'know, if they knew what they were doing they probably didn't give you real names either.
Hey, uh, you can't recycle yearbooks, can you?
You don't seem to understand. See, I was Dr. Drake Remoray.
So what if he didn't come! We can still go out and party ourselves!
Home is Home Star stew.
Hey!
A two and a five.
Well, the part's mine if I want it.
"Take good care of your Momma son."
Damnit!
Hey, y'know what you guys? I think I'm gonna go walk her home.
Whaaat?
Yeah!
The Silly Putty! It's not so silly anymore!
oh and you know what you should bring the black see-through teddy with the attached garters.
All right well, I'll take you someplace nice then. Look! A guy tipped me a hundred bucks today.
Ross!! We're having a surprise party for Rachel!!
Ooh, I'll play! I'll play!
I am learning so much from you.
Yeah, I guess. It's just parents, after a certain point, you gotta let go. Even if you know better, you've gotta let them make their own mistakes.
Okay, good, good, good, 'cause, good, 'cause I was kinda having second thoughts too.
All right, we have to pick captains.
Uh...well...just once...with you...
Nooo, four.
Hey, stripper!
Because of... the reason.
Hey!
Come on man, really how old?!
No-hey-no! If you don't want me to do it, I except that. I don't care about that. I just...I don't want you to be upset.
Oh, y'know, when we did that was when that bird was flying overhead with the fish in his mouth. Did you see it? It was gross!
Like when I want a job, I go to an audition and if I'm the best of the people they see, they give me the part.
Oh, oh, I thought that was your character's name, you know, I thought you were like an Indian or something, you know with a...
Wow.
Yeah really, Ross, have you ever been beaten up before?
No I didn't.
Lucky bastard!
Her name is Dutch, and also Marklan.
Absolutely! Halloween is the worst. Except for Christmas...and their birthdays. Kinda get a little crazy during the summer too. And anytime they're hungry or sleepy. Y'know, kids are tough. Good luck with that.
Aw! Does that mean the Sam Goody's sale is over?!
Yeah, right Monica. I'm so sorry.
Well, this has been great!
Wow, you are a good friend, 'course the audition was this morning, and I didn't get it. But that was a hell of a kiss. Rachel is a very lucky girl.
Right. No big deal.
Hey, that woman's got an ass like Carol's! What? Thought we were trying to find stuff.
Well I tried, but people kept coming in and then you took your breast out!
Sure! Why not?
Uh... How long have we known each other?
Theres the waitress. Excuse me, Miss. Hello, Miss?
I bet I stopped listening before you did.
This is where I keep the pizza. And-Hey! Where did the napkin go?!
Oh come on! Just pick one! Between Monica, Phoebe, Chandler, and Ross if you had to, if you had to, who would you punch?
Oh, oh! Maybe we can lure them out. You know any birdcalls?
Hi!
I'm out.
Yep.
Hey-hey-hey-ho-ho, I got this one. Here you go. Y'know I gotta tell ya, sometimes I just-I don't get Chandler. Y'know, me and him do stuff all the time without you and you don't get all upset.
I don't know.
Okay.
If you wanna get back in the car, we need the wire, your call.
Aww crap!
Pheebs, give me the ring back!
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Look. I take a girl out, she can order whatever she wants! The more, the better! All right? Just don't order a Garden salad and then eat my food! That's a good way to lose some fingers!
I will be okay! Look Chandler, you gotta get it out of your head that I can't take care of myself. Okay? Look, I'm not gonna miss you helping me out with money. The only thing that I'm gonna miss...is you. And now the dog.
I need something sweet.
Ooh, hey, I know how we can decide! All right, uh, I'm gonna ask you a bunch of questions and then you have to answer real fast. Okay? So uh, clear your mind Clear it right out! Clear it out! Clear!
Well, I've never been through the tunnel myself, 'cause as I understand it, you're not allowed to go through with more than one girl in the car, right. But, it seems to me it's pretty much like anything else, you know, face your fear. It have a fear of heights, you go to the top of the building! If you're afraid of bugs.....get a bug. Right. In this case, you have a fear of commitment, so I say you go in there and be the most committed guy there ever was.
Hi!
Well?!
A widower.
Because they wanted me to audition!
It's not on my head.
Y'know what? Why don't you just give us our souvenirs and get the hell out of here?
So, I hear you're single now...
Huh.
I like it.
Hey.
Yeah, they said I acted too much with it. I told everybody about this! Now everybody's gonna go to the theatre, expecting to see me, and...
Yeah?
Look, which one of us is gonna be having sex in there, me or you?
I will, really. I'll pay you back this time.
Huh?
Now hold on a second, fifth floor against that back wall?
Yeah! Yeah, I've been trying to find ya to tell to stop messing with her and maybe I would have if these damn boat shoes wouldn't keep flying off!
Oh, yah, sure.
Awww! Mel Torme died.
So, why are you still wearing it?
Excellent. The shrew in particular was exclusive.
No, was my best friend. Anyway, I don't know why you're pushing for him so hard. With him out of the way as my best friend, there's a spot open.
A book? Is it like a book that's also a safe?
No no no, I am not giving you a cigarette.
Guggly worm.
Come on baby, don't go. Please? What do you say?
That makes more sense.
No way! I've been going to the guy for 12 years.
It's no Ukrainian film.
You could say: "Hey Kenny, how come you're not Britney Spears?"
No. No, I'm Joey Tribbiani; we did a scene together yesterday. I-I'm the guy in the coma!
Oh, oh, oh...
Yeah...
Interesting...
Wow Pheebs, you speak Italian?
Y'know what, I don't think we should listen to this anymore.
You guys are messin' with me, right?
What about Andre?
All right. Uhh, okay. Our first contestant is Ross Geller. Why don't you tell us a little something about you Ross?
What?! Oh my-oh my God!
Oh, dude I'm so sorry!
Re! Re! Then I can watch that! Rewind it! Rewind it!
Then I don't know what it is. What's the problem?
Oh my God! Is that why you guys had to get married?!
All right!
Look Rach, wasn't this supposed to a temporary thing? I thought you wanted to do fashion stuff?
Hey...
Are they? I didn't know I cared that much.
No! No! No! You guys were totally right! This is so much better than the first time we went out. Y'know? That was so awkward, we were really nervous.
Y'know, I've done nothing but crappy plays for six years. And I finally get my shot, and I blow it!
Say that to him and you're golden.
Thank you, but it would take me forever to pay you that money back and I don't want that hanging over my head. Okay? Besides, as soon as my insurance kicks in I can get all the free operations I want! Yeah, I'm thinking I'll probably start with that laser eye surgery too.
Hi. I'm Joey Tribbiani; I'm here to audition for man.
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! I don't want to go. I'm having fun.
Glass of fat?
Okay, let's see, we got strained peas, strained carrots... Ooh! Strained plums. We haven't tried that yet.
I doubt it. Mostly regional work.
Sure is.
Hey Phoebs.
Uh, okay I'll-I'll-I'll break it down.
Yeah, but I don't wanna die!
I know! I know it's awful.
Uhh, excuse me is there a Mr. Bowmont at this table?
Hey! Get into gear!
You knew about that?
No. They really like me over there. They want to do a big profile on me, but I said no.
Whoa-whoa, that-that was just a theory! There's a lot of theories that didn't pan out. The lone gunman. Communism. Geometry.
Okay, what if the puppy said, "Help me Chandler. All the other puppies pick on me."
It's not right what Emily wants you to do! She is totally--Owww!! Stop pinching me! Look, now you guys said I only had to keep my mouth shut as long as Ross was happy, right? Well he just told me that he's not entirely happy.
Shhhh!
Hey, look, since we're neighbors and all, what do you say we uh, get together for a drink?
I don't want to drive all the way back by myself, I get so lonely. Oh-ooh! How about you come with me?
Yeah, unless you hook up with a bunch of pigeons.
Hey! That must be why I got fired last week! Does this Orson Wells guy direct Burger King commercials?
Nice move.
What the hell is that?
Yeah-yeah right. That's okay. That's fine. That's uh, pretty much what I was expecting. So uh, it's no big deal. All right? I think I'm gonna go.
Excellent! Excellent! And uh, finally, are you into any weird stuff y'know, sexually?
Hey-hey don't look at me! I just work here!
Hey, how much cash do you got in your pocket right now?
Dude, if you go back out there, you're gonna be Dead Ross!
Yeah! She is cool, and she's so smart! Her mind is totally acrimonious . That's not how she used it...?
Thank you. Wait-wait-wait-wait, you see me again. Hang on, the guy's butt's blockin' me. There I am, there I am, there I am, there I am, there I am...
Well uh, it's just that uh, y'know if-if you're gonna be wearing someone's sweatshirt shouldn't it be your boyfriends--and I'm not him.
Congratulations.
Uhh, they're tall.
I thought you already have a job.
For Ross.
Well this is noodle soup and uh, I've been working with tomato. But that's okay, no problem. No problem. Hmm, noodle soup.
I don't know, she's, uh.... she's pretty great.
Whoa-whoa-whoa! You're not gonna use the pay phone to call work, are ya?
Hey!
Yeah, sure. Go ahead. Oh, me, right!
Really?
Right. Dja bu bu Claude. Uh, c'est la pu les la lu blah bloo.
How you doin'? Joey Tribbiani, America.
Listen, uh, you wanna go get a drink or something?
Maybe he, uhh... drives his car on the other side of the road, if ya know what I mean.
Oh, I know how we can decide. Phoebe, show him your game!
No! No! No! It's different for you. You're so strong and together. You're not some dumb kid who doesn't know what she's doing.
That's a huge thing!
Ross bruises like a peach. He bruises like a peach.
Monica, have you ever been with him when he wasn't drinking?
You like someone. Tell me who it is. Who is it?
We don't make enough fun of you already?
I guess it could've been, I didn't really look at it. Y'know, I just wiped it on Chandler's coat and got the hell out of there.
Hey, hey, check it out, guess what I got.
Hey!
Umm, no. No best friend, no. Just a lot of close friends.
Sperm or regular?
Oh, yeah, well I already did that! They said they're gonna look into it right after they solved all the murders.
Of course it does! It's smart! I used the the-saurus!
Ah, hi, ah. Thank you so much for whispering for my benefit, but, ah, look, if you just tell me what I did wrong, I'd just love to work on it and come back and try it again for you. And, and also: 'How you doing?' You should, please, just gimme another chance. I really wanna get better, please.
Hey, yeah! Then we could do that telephone thing! Y'know, you have a can, we have a can and it's connected by a string!
No.
Hey!
You don't know how long we're gonna be in here! We may have to repopulate the Earth.
Hey, listen, I gotta tell ya, I feel kinda bad taking credit for this, because man, am I gonna get a lot of credit for this!
And for Ross, Mr. Sweet-tooth.
Hello?
Oh we kissed it up real nice.
Yeah?
Oooooh!
A meatball Sub? Thanks!
WHAT?!!
your right! I love my life! I actually did sleep with her.
yeah but she should remember sleeping with me I am very memorable, you guys know.
Oh!
No!
Oh, you will when I pick you as starting forward.
Hello, I'm Joey Tribbiani! Let's play Bamboozled! Erin, you get the first question! In hockey, who is known as The Great One?
Hey and look he brought flowers. Thanks Ross, but I'm really more of a candy guy.
Whoa-ho-ho! Yeah, okay.
No.
Okay, it's an audio question, name this television theme song.
Really?
Oh.. I don't know why this is so hard for me. you know.. I mean lying is basically just acting and I am a terrfic actor.
All right, all right maybe-maybe you should just ask her to leave.
But, he loves Emily?
That thing was a hazard! I'm very safety conscious.
Yeah.
Hey!
Let's go watch it at your place.
I'm saying maybe you and I crank it up a notch.
Okay, here we go. I can't do it.
Yeah, this was a stupid idea.
Oh we flipped for it. I got the cigar, he got the moustache. Figured if we both grew it, we'd look like dorks.
Hey, don't get mad at us! No one forced you to raise the stakes!
Yeah! I'll see ya later! Yeah!
Ross?
Yeah, yeah, and then Adrian, she maybe she could wrap her legs around his waist.
And you'll be topless?
Ok, um, uh, we three feel like, that uh, sometimes you guys don't get that uh, we don't have as much money as you.
Rachel's having her baby!! Which is of no interest to me, I'm a neurologist.
Stop saying good night.
I.. I.. I need a good lie.
I dunno!
Well, hey! Well... Here's to Phoebe, who's found the greatest guy in the world! To Phoebe and... I wanna say Mike? To Phoebe and Mike!
No, come on Ross! Look, Ross, we have to get past this.
Check it out, Giants-Cowboys.
I fell down an elevator shaft.
Dude! What are yo-you trying to kill me?!
Kathy was being really nice and you just walked away. I thought we had a deal.
Yes.
Hey.
OK, you've got to promise that you'll never, ever tell Ross that I told you.
Kinda, but I've just been having way too much fun.
You got to tell me exactly what to do there.
Fine.
All right. All right.
Wh? Monday, one day. Tuesday, two day. Wednesday, when huh what? Thurs- Oh!
Hey.
Hap.. Hap.. Happy Thanksgiving.
What?
Hey. Hey look I am still Joey, okay. Flowers they're just, you know, they're nice to look at. And that happens to be a picture by a famous artist. Of a famous baby.
That's great. But uh, I'm not really expecting a lot of calls.
Chickens?
I have an audition, but I'll definitely hook up with you later. Where are you gonna be around noon?
I know. chandler: Now we can finally watch Green Acres the way it was meant to be seen.
I don't have a key, they took mine to give to you.
I might know something.
Yeah, you've been avoiding her ever since we started going out. Look, I made an effort to like Janice, now I think it's your turn to make an effort to like Kathy by going out to dinner with us. Right?
I could get a goose!
Water breaking, what do you mean? What's that, water breaking?
Oh, classy.
I was tryin' to make a sale!! Oh, man, if I ever run into that guy again, do you know what I'm gonna do?
Yeah! Wow, your like from a whole other country.
You ah, you forgot your shoes.
So what? Look, suppose we were a divorced couple.
Yeah! Help me get this mini-fridge past the security guard.
Nice going. You just saved yourself a couple months of sex.
Hey!
Hey, Phoebe, I asked you, and you said it was okay.
Little bit.
I finished my book.
Now you can't tell anyone, but uh...I put on shiny lip balm.
Hey guys.
So what's really neat. If you sear the stems of the flowers first in a frying pan, your arrangement will look fresh much longer.
Oh, yeah, yeah, good idea.
He's kinda tall, dark hair, hand looks exactly like this. See?
Hmm. Do you sleep with women and never call them again?
Uh-huh look, the only reason I can over here was to settle things between us! Okay? You've done a lot for me and my career, I wanted to pay you back so I took you to the premiere but you missed it! Okay, so how much do I owe you?
Oh! My head! Oh! Oh!
Ok, let me stop you right there. The Mets suck, ok? You wanna see the Yankees.
Come on! What are you doing?! I'm in character! Would you talk to her!
Why? Is it because I'm friends with Phoebe?
What are you talking about? Bitch.
Uhhh.. y'know what? Forget about me. Let's, uh... let's give you another turn.
They break your heart, don't they?
Well, actually the last place you were sitting was in there . Soo...
That sounds perfect!
What's a matter Ross? What you're nervous about your speech?
But uhm, we're getting rid of her, right? Rach, please tell me we're getting rid of her.
Because it kinda looked like I did.
No.
Hey!
Oh great. Hey! Go take off those pants, they look ready!
Do you think you can just buy my friends baby?!
Hey Pheebs!
Luck!
Look, does someone mind switching to sit with Charlie?
I bet you did!
Hey, does somebody wanna hand me one of those tiles.
Oh my God! That's huge! Wait a minute, why come I wasn't invited? And who was going to be your best man? Don't say, "Ross." Do not say, "Ross."
You want me to lie to Chandler?
I don't want to. You do it!
Yeah! All right-Look, I know sometimes it'll be hard, okay? But, it'll also be really...really great. Please Rachel! I-I-I really want you to stay.
Yeah.
Hey Rach.
Yeah, sure. Well y'know, earlier she was talking about geography.
I don't want to, I'm scared.
I am... free!
Hey! You guys! You're not gonna believe this! I just got off the phone with my agent...
What a tool!
What?!
Aw, I know all about Kip!
Hey!
How you got three women to marry you, I'll never know.
She is so hot!
Just because she went to Yale drama, she thinks she's like the greatest actress since, since, sliced bread!
Pheebs, if this guy keeps closing down all of our favorite places, where are we gonna eat?!
See? Eh, wasn't that fun?
Oh, so you're playing Adrienne, huh?
You don't have to worry about that okay?
Oh, man, she loved it! She's over there showing Monica and Rachel right now.
Actually, tomorrow night kinda depends on how tonight goes.
Really? Who-who have you taught?
All right.
Yeah!
Vulva?
Okay.
Yeah, we look great together.
Man With Eye Patch! You get in there and you do your job.
Well, I... I know exactly what I'm gonna do!
Well, we have to say something! We have to get it out! It's eating me alive!! Monica got stung by a jellyfish.
Well, that one did not have Emma's face on it.
Hey.
All right, you're probably not gonna want to hear this but ah, if it was me, and this is just me, I would ah, I would bow out.
I'm not quite sure.
Uh Ross! Are there uh, are there naked chicks on that piece of paper?
Um-hmm! Look, I-I-I don't know how much more of this I can take! Did you know he taped over my Baywatch tape with some show about bugs! My God! What if that had been porn?
All right! I'll have a sandwich!
Hey!
You should both know, that he's a dead man. Oh, Chandler?
You wanna smell him?
I'm cold!
Hey! You don't get a say in this!
Hey, dude, let me in. I got a girl out here!
Oh, uh, again. Can I make a special request: Can you bring everything as soon as it's ready? Appetizers, entrees, we don't care.
But he's the same.
Hey, what time is it?
I love you.
Don't you ah, don't you wanna ask me any questions?
Street noise drowned any of that out? No, all right, I see you later, okay...
What are you talking about? Lots of things rhyme with Rachel. Bagel. Mail. Jail. Bail. Able. May-pole.
Well, he can be a little rough around the edges, so I'm gonna replace a word he used a lot, with the word "puppy." Okay, So He Said "If your puppy friend doesn't get her puppy act together, I'm gonna fire her mother-puppy ass."
Oh no no no no no... It wasn't... It wasn't because of your money problems, it was for something for her.
...I'm his
Thank you.
Yeah, yeah, they must have jumped off the table, 'cause now they're gone!
Thanks Ross. I really like that bird though...I'll take the dog though.
Pheebs! There you are!
Ah, look who's back! Why do you have bags? RACH, WHY DOES SHE HAVE BAGS?
Yeah, yeah. We went to a Mets game, we got Chinese food, and you know, I love this woman. You have got competition buddy.
Oh, I'm sorry, Ross. I'll get it for you right now. And since I made you wait, I'll toss in a free muffin.
Oh! Maybe they'll name yours after you! Y'know, they'll call it, The Ross. And then people would be like, "Awww, he's got a Ross."
Yeah! Okay.
Yeah, I want my tickets too ! And I'm buying the Knicks! And Steffi Graff, ah ah!
Oh, no no no. Its for Ursula. I just figured, you know, size-wise.
No wonder Rachel had to read this so many times.
Yeah, my uncle Sal has a really big tongue.
Yeah!
It is me! It's a musical version of Tale of Two Cities. So I think I'm gonna sing New York, New York, and ah, oh I left My Heart in San Francisco.
What?
So Monica, still going out with Dr. Boring huh?
Look, what am I gonna do? I'm not flirting but still, I'm drawing her to me like - like a moth to a flame! What the hell's going on over here?!?!? Monica's gonna kill you! Look I need your help, I have to do something to-to repel this woman! Wait a minute, wait a minute, you guys repel women all the time.
Oh, I'm sorry. I meant no.
How can they do this to me?
Oh no! How can she do that when she's never shown any interest in you?!?
Oh come on. Nobody likes two different kinds of eggs equally. You like one better than the other and I wanna know which.
So it's noticeable huh?
Did-did it make you wanna walk around in your underwear?
I'm gonna get the lasagna.
Yeah, you shoulda been there last night.
Hm-mmm.
Oh we're not out. No, no. We're just uh, two heterosexual guys, hanging with the son of our other heterosexual friend, doin' the usual straight guy stuff.
Hey, you wanna do Joey a favor, maybe you go out with Joey.
No! He blew us off!
Oh my God. You do?
I gotta go check something over here.
Heard about the leg burnin' huh?
That's great! That would be great! Let's do that!
Shoot! Shoot! Shoot! Shoot, or just fall down. That's good too.
Right over there! Right there! Look-look-look!
Not me.
Chandler! You are not gonna believe this! I have found my identical hand twin!
You guys okay?
When you say used, do you mean eat as a pre-cooking snack?
Whoa!
Oh-oh-oh-oh, how I do it is, I look a woman up and down and say, "Hey, how you doin'?"
Hey you guys! What's happening?
Isn't that great?
Thanks! Yeah, there's pulp in that.
I'd really prefer a mountain bike.
Please, c'mon, you're the smartest person I know and I really like this girl, ok, I don't wanna lose her.
Not likely. 'Cause you see that body bag right there
Better?
Yeah! I was thinking about maybe going upstairs and taking a little nap on my couch.
Yeah!
We, we come back from our walk and the- the phone was ringing...
Hey!
And I like to think I had a little something to do with it.
Really?! Well, when?
What's happenin'?
Exactly.
No, still too ethnic. My agent thinks I should have a name that's more neutral.
Anything I can do? Whatever you need.
This is Vegas man! People will pay to see freaky stuff! Okay, how much would you pay to see this hand twice? Huh?
She's a woman!
No! Because he didn't believe in my movie! Which is a big mistake because it is real! Real!
You think I need a new walk?
Yeah, yeah. The pay is pretty good and you could do it for as long as you need.
Well, the tough thing is, she really wants to have sex with me.
Yeah, big stuff.
The vicar!
What are you talkin' about? I never left you! You've always been my agent!
Ok, you know what blows my mind? Women can see breasts any time they want. You just look down and there they are. How you get any work done is beyond me.
I know, I'm so bummed. Can we have our free crab cakes now?
How'd you get over that teacher?

Yeah, but what if he doesn't? He's such a good duck.
Hi, here's the deal. We lost a carseat on a bus today. It's white plastic, with a handle, and it fits onto a stroller. Oh, and there was a baby in it. He wants to talk to you again.
One-Mississippi. Two-Mississippi. Three-Mississippi.
Y'know, I'm beginning to see what Jake was talking about.
What was it?
Oh. Okay. Ooh! Ooh! Okay, maybe I'll talk about London! Y'know when you two hooked up! Only, only I won't say hooked up. I'll say, "Began their beautiful journey..."
Hey you guys I'm gonna take off. I just wanted to let you guys know, say goodbye.
Cut it out Ross! I hate to have to save your life and kick your ass in the same day!
There you go! That's the spirit I'm looking for! What can we do? Huh? All right who's first? Huh? Ross?
And I think he would tell you it was a mistake.
Well, we got plenty of space! There-there's still some over there by-by that speaker. Please, just stay!
For a walk.
Absolutely! He's not thinking about you.
Oh no! No!! My hole!!
No-no, I can't! I can't! Not after the other night, it's just it's...too weird, okay? Don't tell her I'm here! Don't eat that!
You got a little bored?
Yeah! No?
Oh, it's perfect!
Hey!
No, look, you know Charlie, right? She's cool, she's funny, her body is soo...
Do you want me to want you to care?
Oh, they're so cute! Now, what, what kinds are they?
Got it! Hey hey hey! Where do you think you're going?
Now I can't believe it! What? Rachel's pregnant? Who's the father?
Hey Rach?
Yeah I'll take that.
No-no-no-no-no.
Could you get me a muffin?
What's going on?
Uh, yeah but uh, I may have said those things before but, I never truly meant them. Until now.
No, hit me.
Y'know, you look familiar. Do I know you from somewhere?
Yeah?
Okay. Hey uh, when do I get to meet the robot?
Someone you didn't make up!
Oh no, no, no, let your dad get this.
Oh my God, that's great! I'm smart!! No, no, I'm... "brainy, bright, clever", I love this thing! Look out ladies, Joey Tribbiani's got the whole package!!
I can't find the remote. Thank you.
Yeah, you're roommate is a soap opera star.
Me too! There's a game on Tuesday do you wanna go?
Not a problem. Oh, and just so you know, that guy's not going to be bothering you about that baby thing anymore.
No man, that's huge! Now, I know I can stand to be around her, which means I get to hang out with you, which is kinda the whole point, anyway.
You don't say.
Am I in it?
Are you kidding me? I'm great! Yeah, I'm uh; I'm better than great. I am good. And now that she's gone, I can uh, I can do all this stuff around here that I couldn't do before. Y'know? Like umm, I can walk around naked again. Y'know? I can uh, I can watch porn in the living room. Right? This is uh, this is good for me. Y'know? I like being on my own, I'm uh, better off this way. I'm uh, a lone wolf. Y'know? A loner. Alone. All alone. Forever. What's a wolf got to do to get a huh around here?!
I know! It's stuck!!!
Well, they go into the chipper.
No-no-no-no-no, I saw an ad for this video, people climb that thing everyday! We could totally do that!
Hey, I'm not interested in her sweater! It's what's underneath her sweater that counts. And besides, since ah, since when do you care who I'm going out with?
And that's how I know you didn't watch the tape! .
I'd seen this thing on The Discovery Channel...
I can do that! "Hello, I'm your professor. When I'm not busy thinking of important things or... professing. I like to use..." Oh, what's the product?
Look, we are not gonna...
Hi, uh, I'll be reading for the role of Mercutio.
Please I have an extremely high threshold...Holly Mother Of God! My face! My face!! I'm all right! I'm all right!Just a little bit of shock that's all but I'll be fine you can go again. I'm OK Dammit! Woman!! How Hoooow!
Oh, y'know what? Since I'm here, I think I'm gonna have me a little beer on the port side.
Hey, you guys! Take a look at this! Check this baby out, dug me a hole!
I want you to take this seriously! Phoebe is very very important to me, ok? And I wanna make sure that you are gonna take care of her.
No! No! No! For my new fridge-our new fridge!
The Empty Vase. Translucent beauty...
With a man?
Because she is!
Yeah.
Really?!
And of course, crotchless panties.
Aw-awww!
Yeah, Big Brother.
Hi everyone.
Yep!
Did you hear that? I only get one extra ticket to my premiere. So some how I have to pick between you three and Ross.
Why God?! Why are you doing this to us?!
Oh, hey, Lauren. Uh, you guys this is, this is Kate's understudy, Lauren.
Yeah, he's done some amazing works.
No, Rach, I should've told you sooner. It's just that...Man! That kid is going to town!
Err, "I think you know".
No reason, I'm just saying that uh... That's where I'll be.
Oh, hold up, I'll walk out with you. Now, Rach, when she taught you to kiss, you were at camp, and.. were you wearing any kinda little uniform, or- That's fine, yeah...
Oh, it was so amazing. After the love making...
Thursday! Look if you need help remembering think of like this, the third day. All right? Monday, one day. Tuesday, two day. Wednesday, when? Huh? What day? Thursday! The third day! Okay?!
But I'm bursting with u-hu!
Ugh, I cannot wait to ask her out!
Uh, well yeah-yeah, I've got all of that going on. Yeah, listen uh, I want you to make sure you tell Chandler that he couldn't have been more wrong! Uh-oh! I gotta go Monica, my uh, my sushi's here!
Hit me, hit me.
Hey!
You own the room. We should probably get-get uh...
Cool!!
Hi Ben! So you wanna be an actor huh? I gotta tell ya, it's no picnic. There's tons of rejection. No stability. One day you're Dr. Drake Remoray, the next day you're eating ketchup right out of the bottle.
I'm thinking about you...
That's not the point Chandler. The point is that you lied.
No seriously... I'm really wedged in here.
So! Things can go wrong! You don't know! What if he doesn't make it?!
Oh, sometimes we use the same extras for different parts. It's okay.
Listen I uh... It's a scary world out there especially if you're a single mom. Y'know, I always felt like you and I have this-this special bond. Y'know? So, Rachel Green will you marry me?
Hey! Handcuffs! And fur line, nice! I didn't know you guys had it in ya!
You're not the same!
By someone besides Monica?
Here. I need to borrow some moisturizer.
All right.
Yes.
Thank you. Wait wait wait wait, you see me again. Hang on, the guy's butt's blockin' me. There I am, there I am, there I am, there I am, there I am. . .
What are you talking about? It was a big deal. I mean, come on you can't tell me last night didn't mean something to you. I-I was there, you're not that good an actress.
Hey, hey, I just figure Joseph's the kinda guy that likes to mix it up. Ya know, get in there, ruffle some feathers.
Good, and hey! My treat. But that's only because you're not eating anything, right?
And I gotta pay rent! Look, how-how about this? You don't fire me, instead I stay here, I gain their trust, and they'll start listening to all the nice things I've been saying about you.
Oh yeah. These are my old work pants, Sergio Valente's.
It's nothing.
I'd like to propose a toast. To Monica and Chandler, the greatest couple in the world. And my best friends. Now, my when I first found out they were getting married I was, I was a little angry. I was like, "Why God? Why? How can you take them away from me?!" But then I thought back over all our memories together, some happy memories. And-and there was some sad memories. I'm sorry. And-and some scared memories-Whoa! Eh? And then, and then I realized I'll always be their friend, their friend who can speak in many dialects and has training in stage combat and is willing to do partial nudity. Oh! To the happy couple!
I'm the lead in Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.!!
Well, maybe he's, maybe he's this really cool pharmacist guy.
You meant sex, right?
If you hated the bracelet so much, Chandler, you should have just said so.
Ah. Slow swimmers?
I know, I know! What am I going to do? Ooh!
Yes! Excellent! Perfect score!
Awww, man! He promised he wouldn't take the chairs!!
Oh, unbelievable! We had the best time!
Because you waited too long to make your move, and now you're in the friend zone.
Aaron! You gotta let me go. The guy's hammered!
You've seen my huge stack of porn right?
Okay, what else?
Uhhh, I was an impulse buyer, near the register.
You don't have to seem so happy about it.
No, no... how come you are working here?
Oh, can you believe they gave Stephanie skin cancer?
Put your hands together.
Marcel?
Well, it's not a part, no. I'm teaching acting for soap operas down at the Learning Extension.
That's what I wanted to hear! Because she's family, ok, and now you're gonna be family, and there is nothing more important in the whole world, than family.
Actually, you have a little bit of an edge.
I'm not really comfortable with these questions!
What?
I was tryin' to make a sale!! Oh, man, if I ever run into that guy again, do you know what I'm gonna do?
Set another place for Thanksgiving. My entire family thinks I have VD.
That's what it says.
I'm sorry, do I know you?
Hey! Joey Tribbiani! I'm here! I'm here!
Wow! This looks great!
Yeah.
Where's Chandler? I wanna wish him good luck on his first day. ... and I smelled bacon.
Yeah, and not put us in the middle.
Oh, not my parrot.
Oh, so we didn't win, but it's fun to play the game, right?
It's ah, step-ity, step and jazz hands.
So I just talked to one of the DOOL writers today, and...
Nothing...
This body?
wow, the parade is really good this year. Man those horses can crap.
I thought you didn't have secrets from Monica.
Ahhh!
Well he made Rachel cry!
Uh, some of her friends, yeah.
Yeah, yeah... Absolutely. I mean, just because something's difficult doesn't mean that you quit.
Are you kidding me? I never rent a movie without it! Oh. Uh, okay uh let me call you back.
Hey! I'm an actor too! I'm not sure. I think they're taking the ferry out to some Italian place on Staten Island.
I want to do it again.
Yes it is perfectly good, and it is not one of the places the duck got sick!
Oh, yeah, totally! That's such a turn-on!
Okay, so-so which route should I take the northern route or the southern route?
Huh?!
Hello.
Hi!
All-all right! Start it up! Let's go!
Oh, yeah, with the mug painting. Yeah. I was so listening to that. But ah, y'know what, I think I kinda need to work on my stuff tonight.
You fall for it every time!
Nope.
They're gonna do it together.
Excuse me, could we get an egg over here, still in the shell? Thanks.
Not from where I was standin.
Ohh yeah.
All right, all right, all right. I mean I'll have to check with him first, but I'll think he'll be cool with it.
Wow.
Ma, I'm sorry. I just did what I thought you'd want.
How do you get a monkey into a zoo?
Really? That's great! You and my sister, sittin' in a tree.
Hey you're right. Yeah, it's kinda been like us again a little bit.
Dude! He's right there!
I don't know. We're talking about whipped fish, Monica. I'm just happy I'm keeping it down, y'know?
Yeah. You know why? 'Cause you came to me first.
Okay. I'm in.
Oh, no thanks, I got it. No I don't!
Hey, it's your girlfriend, Rachel!
So, I guess this is it.
Hey! I'm meeting Kathy in ten minutes! I've been looking all over for you!
Oh wow, I don't feel well.
An-an-anyway I-I just wanted to say that since I'm getting your brain when you leave the show, I was wondering if there was any tips you can give me...
Yeah! You did! And that's why I'm leaving.
Are we watchin' the tape or not?!
Hey, what's up?
Okay. Table, you have given us so many great times. And you guys, Jordan, Victor, Joel... All of you guys. What can I say? You guys make us look good. You wanna say anything?
What's up buddy?
Ross, wait!
No, they're comin', we're waitin' right here.
Yeah, definitely, definitely. Ok, what do you wanna see first?
Come on, I'll show you guys where to check in.
Do we have to know about that?
Umm, listen, Ross do you really think this moving in with Rachel is a good idea?
Hey no-no-no-no! It's cool! It's cool! I-I'll only be a second, I'm still with my bride's maid, I just-Where are those condoms you brought?
Why not? I'll keep the tank clean.
Well what is it?!
Man. Can you believe he's only had sex with one woman?
Hang up, hang up.
Well, there's gonna be strippers there. He didn't say anything about no strippers.
Tell me about it, huh? Oh no-no-no, I'm not with her, she's just Monica! Ewwuck!
Oh no-no-no-no, I meant Chandler.
Okay.
I'm an actor, y'know? As-as a group, we tend to be over dramatic.
Hey! Now, we're not actually gonna be sleeping in her, but do you mind?
Y'know-y'know what I really want?
Was his name Angus?
What the hell!
Yeah, we just don't happen to know any women that know how to play poker.
Man, I remember the first time I saw that girl Katherine, after we broke up. She was just walking with her friend Donna, just laughing and talking. God, it killed me.
I met her at the library. I went in to pee.
Yeah! Yeah!
Yeah, that's her.
It's like me when I was born.
I can't write! Y'know I mean I-I-I'm an actor, I don't have the discipline that takes, y'know? I can't do it.
Y'know, Monica and Chandler are married. Ross and Rachel are having a baby. Maybe you and I should do something.
Little bit, yeah.
Oh, let me get this. These are for you.
Ah, y'know just in general people being gay, thing. I'm totally cool with that.
It's really starting to hurt.
Easy there Captain Kirk. Oh, do you have a bobby pin?
I can an A? In-in school? Hey, I'm a dork.
Okay, so will you meet with her?
Hey!
No. I was told the name of the movie would not appear on the bill!
No thanks.
Nicole Eggert. You'll like her.
Good for you!
Come on who? Who do you like? Tell me. You're not getting away that easy. Who do you like, who?
Hey, don't start judging me! Huh? You're the one who's in love with her assistant! Huh? And you, you're the one having the affair with the guy who keeps the pigeons on the roof!
Hey!
I'm sorry! Okay? I went down to the gift shop and it's either this or a bathrobe! Look, what's more important, the way I'm dressed or me being with you on your special day?
Yeah well we should order some food then.
Cool.
Look, you guys have been to every play I've ever been in, have I ever had chemistry on stage?
Oh I think we do.
"I am what you made me! You know what?"
Yeah. Yep. Yeah. All right, well uh, I'd better go.
Exclusively.
Damnit, I'm a doctor, I'm not God.
Alright Ross, look. You're feeling a lot of pain right now. You're angry. You're hurting. Can I tell you what the answer is?
And the duck gets the Nutter-Butter!
Oh-whoa, what party?
je.
Well, what did you say to her?
All right, well maybe I'm enjoying it a little bit. I mean I'm getting pretty good at it.
I got this pair marked excess, I gotta tell ya, there was no room for excess anything in there.
No you won't.
Yowsa!
You got porn!
Oh.
Hey. Can, uh, can we help you?
Hey, that pregnant girl's name was Erica.
Hey.
Of course we do! Mike is playing a game that we used to play in high school. Yeah, where we pretend we don't know each other. We played all kinds of games. Hey, remember the one where I punch you in the face for not being cool?!
I don't know how to lead.
'Kay!
Nooo!
Well y'know, I've been walking the same way since high school. Y'know, y'know how some guys they walk into a room and everybody takes notice. I think I need a 'take notice' walk.
Uhm... Aren't you a little overdressed?
Oh, I was reading it last night, and I got scared, so.
I'll be fun.
Phoebe!
Oh yeah, sure, that makes sense. Yeah. 'Cause you already told her you love her and she didn't say it back, then she called you and told you that there's another guy, so yeah, go to London that'll scare her!
I love ya.
Morning! Hey, how's my favorite genius and my little robot buddy?!
That's because all people are selfish.
Okay, I know it sounds crazy, but I think it might work. Y'know? The only problem is, Carl's acting is...
Chandler! He's here!
How do I look?
Name? I know Ross but what's it short for? You know like, like Rossel or Rosstepher.
Well, well that one has ducks on his t-shirt, and this one has clowns. And Ben was definitely wearing ducks.
What's the matter?
What did I just say?
There's a part in a TV movie that I would be perfect for and I didn't even be put up for it! She'd better have a good reason.
Oh yeah? If I can't, I'll knock five bucks off the price off the unit.
I don't know, it smells good.
Mike, 'attorney at law'!
No. Y'know how we're always saying we need a place for the mail.
Oh my God, quick turn off the TV.
Uhh, I don't believe in these crazy diets y'know, just everything in moderation.
That's true.
What are they doing out here? The coast's all the way over there.
What are you in love with her or something?
No! But y'know, I'm an actor, I'll act cool.
Hey that's not true! Look at uh, look at Angela Lansb-Angelina Jolie!
But he's the same.
What're you gettin' so bent out of shape for, huh? It's not like we agreed to live together forever. We're not Bert and Ernie.
Good, otherwise my watch would fall off.
Name one!
Hey! That's the day after I stop menstruating! This isn't mine.
Yeah.
Hey!
No. No. No.
Okay, everybody just keep smiling. It'll kill my grandmother if she finds out.
Oh yeah?
When is she leaving?
Yeah, you're gonna go up to her and say, "Here's your egg back, I'm returning your egg."
Does a good teacher say, "Put down the beer pinhead!?"
And about this Nancy thing... If you're not sleeping with her, should I?
Seriously?
Yeah! Right! People eat birds... Bird meat... Now do they just fly into your mouth or you go to... you go to a restaurant and you say: "Excuse me, I'll have a bucket of fried bird." Or... or maybe just a wing or...
Well it does when you combine it with, "This is so embarrassing, I just want to have a normal life!"
Well, you're timing couldn't be better. She's not my girlfriend anymore.
She didn't have a birthday while we were going out.
Then you're not invited.
Now, y'know the bee probably died after he stung ya.
So, Ross and Rachel got married, Monica and Chandler almost got married, do you think you and I should hook up?
Whoa, whoa. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. If you just got back from Tulsa, how did your suitcase beat you here?
Well, no, not exactly! All right, look, I, I wasn't trying to save Ross. Okay? My sandwich was next to Ross. All right? I was, I was trying to save my sandwich.
Yeah, this slow roasted salmon, just how slow are we talkin' here?
Yeah. No-no I-I know I might not win, but it's just...I've never even been nominated before! I want it so much.
What are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing?
You do, thanks.
Really, hey, you mind if I turn the heat down?
For the ride.
Oh no-no-no-no, she wants to talk to you!
Oh, little party favours, check it out!
Hey, I only got one good arm, you know. You should be doing stuff for me. Go get me a sweater.
But hey, thanks for teachin' us Cross-Eyed Mary. You guys, we gotta play that at our regular game.
And I'll have all the muffins.
They know you know.
Oh right great! Welcome aboard!
Hello.
I don't know.
You were right before. I mean, friends are so important.
Look, I'm telling you if I put my hand on my stomach right here it doesn't hurt that bad.
Hey.
Ross!
Good morning.
I thought you paid. Ha, guess we won't be going back there!
Oh my.
Who the hell is this guy?
Yeah. All right, I'll talk to you later.
Come on man, you're not a potato.
From now on, it's gonna be Joey and Ross, best friends. Okay! We're gonna be the new Joey and Chandler.
I'll do it!! It'll get the casserole stink off of mine.
Come on, we were great together. And not just at the fun stuff, but like, talking too.
Look, when everyone eats that...that...Banana-Meat thing, they're all gonna' make fun of her, do you want that?
Oh, it's this big budget period movie about these three Italian brothers who come to America around the turn of the century. It's really classy! Oh, and the director is supposed to be the next, next Martin Scorcese.
Stalin...Stalin...do I know that name? It sounds familiar.
Y'know what else makes you wonder?
Okay.
Ohh!!
All right, I-I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You see Rach I'm an actor...
Yeah, Chandler finds me so intimdating that it's better if we're on the same team.
Oh, yeah... of course... yeah... it's a stuffed animal... you know... it's for kids... not for adults... I know that!
That's fire. Beats everything.
Well uh, I wanted to have a few beers, but uh, I got rid of those because Rachel couldn't stand the smell of them. But I have thrown back a lot of orange juice with calcium though. And uh, it's a couple weeks past it's expiration date, so it's got a bit of a kick.
But you gotta have turkey on Thanksgiving! I mean, Thanksgiving with no turkey is like-like Fourth of July with no apple pie! Or Friday with no two pizzas!
Noo! I can't take any more secrets! I've got your secrets. I've got their secrets. I got secrets of my own y'know!
Come on you stupid machine! Come on!
Oh God. Uh, okay, here's the thing, this is the thing, okay, the thing is...
Oh, I'm sorry. You wanna bite?
Chandler, it's like a big gerbil.
Err... I just figured it out! You know, I mean you're not working and the economy is bad.
Hey, how much did you guys tip the super this year?
Wow!
Good night.
I just wanna say that I'm sorry I referred to the vein as a seperate person...
Why?
Okay you guys, I got a little more written. Are you ready?
We did it!!
Well, there were a couple of calls last night, but ah, I don't think any of them are gonna work out.
Nooo, later.
Hey-hey listen...
No, no, no, don't say "listen." I know that "listen." I've said that "listen."
I say, 'I am there!' Cool! Aw, is Ross going to?
No-no-no, please-please Chandler I-I-I would owe you so much!
Hey! How you doin'?
Likewise. Uh, I'll take that. It's what I came for. So, this is new. Where'd you two meet?
C'mon, sit. Just sit down, sit.
Hi.
No, no, no, don't you dare bail on me. The only reason she's goin' out with me is because I said I could bring a friend for her friend.
No. Nope, I uh...I th-I thought it might be kind of a cool character thing. Y'know? He's uh, he's a face toucher.
Oh this is great! I might actually get to play Ben's dad!
Hey!
Okay! When?!
Saw the Porsche out there Mon, lookin' good. When do I get to take that baby out again?
He should take the sack?
Oh, I'm sorry. Thank you Chandler.
You know more than one Fun Bobby?
Monica what're you doin'? You can't go shopping with her? What about Rachel?
It's like, you got so many lines to learn so fast, that sometimes you need a minute to remember your next one. So while you're thinkin' of it, you take this big pause where you look all intense, you know, like this.
Ooh, I like that.
Well, I can't do everything! Look back over your time together.
Wow, you are a good friend, 'course the audition was this morning, and I didn't get it. But that was a hell of a kiss. Rachel is a very lucky girl.
No, no, no! You kneed me in my misters!
All right, what are we havin'?
Im sayin I see a difference.
It is so amazing to meet you. I'm such a big fan of your work.
Nah, you're not tall enough to be a Mark, but you might make a good Barney.
Oh, you bet I am!
Ohhhh, good one! And Yemen that actually sounds like a real country.
They didn't fight a lot?
What are you doing? Get back over on your side of the... Hello!! Hi, I'm Joey, we haven't met.
Dina, if you're having a baby you should be married! Even if it is to Bobby! Dude, that's not a compliment!
Uhh, hey. Where's the other guy?
I can't believe you. You told me it was a nubbin.
Well, what did you have?
Whoa! Hey! Whoa!! Hold up! Are you serious?! So like 3% of the time they don't even work?! Huh? They should put that on the box!
Uh hey look uh Ross, look I think we need to talk about before.
Got it! So...
All right, give it back to me. 5 of hearts.
I want the drugs Ross, I want the drugs!
I can't look at you right now!
Ooh-ooh, I! I am thankful for this beautiful fall we've been having.
Why not?
Well you gotta kiss someone, you can't kiss your sister.
Who's that dirty old lady?
Really? It sounds exactly the same to me.
Uhh, well, she's...really good in bed.
Wow! You look... ... stop-eating hot! Which is like the highest level of hotness!
Atta boy!
Ahh, you drive safe.
Hey!! Hey-hey-hey!
Really?
Services? Oh, services.
So, so, what'd ya think?
Are you thinking about Monica?
Our place, the hall! I...
Y'know what I mean, about how I'm always going out with all these women. And I always figured, when the right one comes along, I'd be able to be a stand-up guy and go the distance, y'know? Now I'm looking at my dad, thinking...
Hey Terry!
Let me see if I approve any of these clowns. This guy wears a rug . This guy's Canadian . And this guy is in a cult, ok, and it costs you 5,000$ to get to level three and I don't feel any different. Joey: Pass, pass, oh, pass, double-pass, pass...
Hey, Bonnie had sex there!
Pisst, Monica. Alright, we really need to start looking out for Rachel. I'll cover the front door. You watch that big hole at the back of the building and I got Chandler covering Ross.
I'm still on the set!
Yeah right.
So, er... how did it go with Celia?
You're a dork.
I can't. It's like this chemical thing, you know. Every time she starts laughing, I just wanna pull my arm off just so that I can have something to throw at her.
Hey, best man number two, Joey Tribbiani. Now I'm not good with the jokes like Chandler here. Boy...but ahh, I just want to say congratulation to the happy couple. I first met Ross in this coffee house back home...Home...New York City...Where everybody knows my name. Well anyway, I love you guys. But not as much as I love America. Could we please..go home now?
But plus, it would be wrong and weird and-and-and bad.
Yeah, they're stuck inside the table!
What-what-what is so funny?
So we are going on two?
Good.
You know those posters for the city free clinic?
Hiya.
This is my friend Rachel. Rachel, Kash, Kash, Rachel.
Oh great! Great! Thank you.
"I can't. Oh, I want to, long pause, but I can't."
Y'know, I'd walk back to London for another frosty one of those bad boys.
Oh, good to know. So close!
Ross and Rachel left us a message saying they were getting married! Isn't that why you guys are here?
That's...kinda hot.
Gotcha. Phoebs, walk with me.
Yeah, well...
Okay, look I'm sorry, I went in there to take a nap and I know I shouldn't have, but you got porn!
Hey dude, what's up?
Yeah!!!
Yeah! I'm fine! Thanks! Hey Rach, how you doin'?
Because... look, no one wants this to happen more than me, ok? I have gone over this moment in my head a hundred times and not once did I ever say no! I couldn't do it to Ross!
Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot you had that whole Rachel thing.
And?
Hey!
What?
Look I'm sorry you guys, I-I just don't think so.
Oh, that looks great! Good ordering!
Oh, come on Rach! My turn just started!
We're not peeking?
You're gonna do it?
Hey, Charlie!
What happened? What happened?
Sandy! Hi! C'mon in! ...You brought your kids.
It is???
Wow, is this friendship? I think so. Check it out, we're bracelet buddies.
Oh yeah? Well, you don't know about Hugsy, my bedtime penguin pal.
Oh sure, yeah, why not?
I know. I know. And this is so much more complicated than it was for those guys. I mean, it's Rachel for God sakes.
Hey. It happened!
Wooooooooow It's like they're on fire!
Man, I'm starving! What the hell was I thinking at dinner?! "Do you want soup or salad?" Both! Always order both!
What kind of profit is that?! And you call yourself an accountant.
Well, I'm makin money now and this is payin' you back for head shots, electric bills, and so many slices of pizza I can't even count. I love ya man.
It's a... It's a "welcome home" sign for the baby.
I think face to face.
Oh no, I can't go. I'm practicing; I got an audition to be the host of a new game show.
He's fine!
Uh, lame cool guy handshake, yeah.
Ah, our little ones are growing up fast, uh?
Pssst...
Aww, you guys are so cute!
Oh, I do. How you doin?
What are these, like famous chickens?
Really?
No. Really?
Who says that wine has to cost more than milk!
Yeah. Yeah, that looks bad. But I didn't...I didn't propose!
A MONTH??
Come on, I mean, you know me, you know...
Yeah, I thought you knew that.
Heh... I was bluffing.
Oh! That's Alicia Mae Emory's outfit!
Yes, 'cause we live together, that's a joke!
Because, Monica, the guy's so good, and I really, really want this part.
Hey, look who's here! It's Joey, and he brought home a friend.
No, I'm not questioning it, I'm saying it's stupid! What?!
Mother-Kisser... I'll shut up.
Don't you remember when we were jogging in the park and we saw that really pretty bird and wanted to take a picture-I didn't have my camera!
Look who's coming around!
Okay!
Hey everybody! Uh, I'd like you to meet Janine. She's-she's gonna be my new roommate!
Oh my, would you look at that!
Okay, the ring fell on the floor and I went down to pick it up and you thought I was proposing.
They want me to be totally naked in the movie!
Why wouldn't she? He's a wonderful person!
Holden McGroin.
Yeah, hey hey, Happy Thanksgiving everybody!
Hey there you are!
Oh yeah, yeah, sure. Absolutely.
All right. Okay. Well this is the same kind of deal. If you're going to do something wrong, do it right!
'Cause I figured you'd hooked up with some girl and she'd left it there.
No-no-no, no, no, wait. You see, I'm an actor, Joey Tribbiani, I'm doing a scene with you today, and well, I stink.
They're brother and sister!!!
Well, I'm doing this telethon thing on TV and my agent got me a job as co-host!
Hey Chandler. Come on in. We're knitting pot holders.
Come on Rach, not again. I got it! Okay? Let's start sailing, and I want to go over there where that boatload of girls is! Yo-ho-ho!
Hey-hey come on you guys, give him a break. Ross, seriously, how's it going with her?
Oh my God!!
No! You don't want to wreck it, you don't want to go to fast!
Felicity and I, we're watching My Giant, and I was thinking, "I'm never gonna be as good an actor as that giant." Do you think I'm just wasting my life with this acting thing?
Yeah, all right.
Oh, you didn't see the Post?
Thanks sweetheart. Give me a little sugar here. Okay.
Dude!
You're really thinking about having sex with your brother?!
Are you ok, Ross?
Oh my God! You did too? It totally freaked me out, what was that?!
Terrified.
Yeah, that's the uh, game we were playing.
Who knows?
Phoebe here with the cab yet?
But my mom always makes them. It's like a tradition. You get a little piece of turkey on your fork, a little cranberry sauce, and a tot! It's bad enough I can't be with my family because of my disease.
All right Ross you're in the lead, would you like to take another question or spin the Wheel of Mayhem?
She is?
You are dogged man! I totally fit!
Hey!
And while we're down at the video store, you know what else we could rent? Die Hard! Oh, y'know what? I just remembered, that Everest thing is only available through mail order.
I know! They suck!!
Oh my God, it's Ross. What are we gonna do?
Monica, how are you gonna do that?
Fine, I'll rent a car and drive...! Ross, you have to get that job!
Well, at the Christmas party him and Santa did some definitely gay stuff!
Do you think we'll get our three bucks back?
All right I'll talk in code. Remember when the kid sees those two blanks in the hallway?
All right, I guess this will be fine.
Yeah. Listen to the slutty nurse.
Hey!
That guy's like a cartoon. What do you see in him anyway?
Well to tell you the truth, they uh, they had a problem with the bag!
They were in his office.
Uuuh.. yes, they are my stuffed clams.
How long do you have to go for?
Hey, that's never gonna make it all the way over here, buddy!
Why-why would she go in the bedroom?
Oh, 'They are warm, nice, people with big hearts'.
Uh-huh, not as high as... It worked! King!
We're now in the ceremony, Monica is about to say, "I do" when her drunk uncle starts yelling. What do you do? Go!
I do! So much! I can't stop thinking about her! I can't sleep, I-
Man, if anyone asked me to give up any of you, I couldn't do it.
Pretty good. It's like you said. It's mostly just putting numbers from one column into another column.
Ah! Okay, well then you don't judge me. I'm gonna suck on the cellophane from the brownie I had before.
Kristen Lang.
Hey.
Okay that's the green stuff talkin'.
Ah, I'm-I'm walking down the aisle...Still walking. I'm about to pass the bridesmaid I hooked up with last night. Hey! I told her "Hey." And now I'm at the front with Ross. It's Phoebe. He looks pretty mad. Uh...I'd better go.
No! No! No Ross! I'm not hot! Are you hot?
Well, before, with the wishbone... I didn't wish we would win the lottery, I wished you'd get the job.
A spoon. Your hands. Your face!
That's right, all the ladies want to stay at Joey's.
Come in. Thanks for comin' back, umm, okay there have been a lot of people interested in the room, but I have narrowed it down and you are one of the finalists!
Oh uh, okay. Yeah.
So what.
Listen, you know how uh, when you're wearing pants and you lean forward I check out your underwear?
Will you relax?! What are you taking this so seriously for? It doesn't matter.
You know, uh... Chandler got you a gift, too.
Aw crap! Okay-uh...uh let's-let's do the rings.
But don't you need experience for a job like that?
Aaahh... How much do I owe you?
Imagine a protective porn bubble if you will, okay?
Oh dear God!
Actually I rent the whole place and, I just got what you meant. Thank you.
You're mean!
Toutes la smore! Bu blu-ay bloo blah ooh! Pfoof!
Hi!
Oh, ehm...I'm...I'm rehearsing my lines.They gave me a big romantic story on Days Of Our Lives. It's the first time my character's got one. I'm so nervous, you know, I really want it to be good!
Yeah?! So's yours!
I gotta do what I gotta do, you gotta do what you gotta do, you just do it.
Yeah baby!
Not anymore.
You are not at Thanksgiving?
So what are you gonna do?
No-no-no-no, no! Who, who were you talking about?
Something called Braxton-Hicks contractions.
Okay.
She was nothing compared to you.
I wanna gooooooo!
Yeah, sorry, the swallowing slowed me down.
Hey!
EH, what do you know!
Ross, you should know that my pants are startin' to come down and I'm not wearing any underwear!
That's OK, Ross, you can ask me. What?
You know what it is? It's a nice place but I gotta see I don't know if I see myself living here. Oh, oh, oh, let me see... Yeah, I could see it.
I couldn't even if I wanted too.
Fifty-six!
I think I know that girl.
Hey, you know about that?!
Uhhhh.
Aaahhh, look at you two... holding hands... huh is this getting serious? Have you not talked about it yet? Am I making you uncomfortable? If you were bigger you'd hit me, huh...? Aaaaaahhhhhh.
I mean, there's no way I can make myself taller now, y'know? And who knows what science will come up with in the future, but Chandler, what if I die an unsuccessful, regular sized man?
What was the other one Ross?
Is that the fire alarm?
Thanks. Congratulations on your big break.
Oh my... How much do you weigh Ross?!
Well, I was Dr. Drake Remoray, Stryker's twin brother. I mean, who looks more me than me right?
Whoa!! Now look, don't be just blurtin' stuff out. I want you to really think about your answers. Okay?
Look, c'mon, please? It's not like I'm asking for some crazy favour. This is what I do for a living. I am a professional actor! Oh, man, I'm two hours late for work! . Look, here's a copy of my reels. It's got all the commercials that I've been in.
All right, and over there is Brady's Pub where I like to unwind after a long day of surgeoning.
Uh-huh. And I named them Chick Jr. and Duck Jr.
Sort of...

Did you get your money back?
Nah.
Well who is this guy?! Huh? Who is he? 'Cause I will track him down and kick his ass!
didn't till just now.
...I d'know.
You can totally tell! Here look, watch me. Smile! Frown. Smile! Frown. Smile!
All right! All right! Uh, umm, Super-Speedy Speed round!
Whoa, hey, maybe I'll go down there with ya and see if I can get an audition to play the dad. I mean who better to play Ben's father than his godfather.
Oh yeah-yeah. And I got the duck totally trained. Watch this. Stare at the wall. Hardly move. Be white.
All right, look, I'm not proud of this, ok? Well, maybe I am a little.
Welcome to America.
Hey, excuse me, would you mind switching with me?
So uh, you and Mona, been a while now. How's it going?
Hey OK great, what would you do if I did this?
Yeah and we'd go check it out, but you took away our keys.
Why not?
Ooh... I can't believe I'm kissing you. I'm kissing Rachel!
Uh-oh.
A year?!
I want this part so much! Y'know? If I don't get this part I'm never gonna eat Macaroni and Cheese again!-No, I didn't say that! That's a lie.
Hey-hey! Stanley! Hey-hey! You're leading man is here! Let's get to work.
You could?
Hey, is uhm... is Chandler here?
Ooh, ooh, I know! We should pool all own money and buy the Knicks!
What's going on?
Uhhh, Phoebe and Joey.
Okay, time to take off the bra.
Clear the tracks for the boobie payback express. Next stop: Rachel Green.
Hi. We're the guys who called about the baby. We left the baby on ths bus. Is he here? Is he here?
Ross!
Yeah, with my mom. Yeah, not so much with my dad.
Then why did I ask?
Hey Chandler, do we know that lady?
Hey! Now I'm a man of the cloth, but I still have feelings!
I guess I didn't really think about it.
Well because you didn't give me advice! No! You gave me a pickup line! As soon as I told her I wanted to y'know, build a foundation and be friends first. I suddenly, through no fault of my own, became irresistible to her! And her roommate!
Who?
Oh, I chose not to hear that.
Well, I started building one. But then I decided to take it to the next step.
Don't you put words in people's mouths, you put turkey in people's mouths!
I put it on to scare Chandler!
Yeah, well, that's fine, but the important thing is that I finished it. And uh, I think it's really good, but y'know it'd really help me is if I could hear it. So would you guys read it for me?
Why don't you like PBS, Pheebs?
That's it! Thanks Pheebs!
That's way uptown! That's like three trains away! Which is great! I love to ride that rail!
Oh, and Mississ-Pete is?
Fine, you want to get the birds, get the birds!
You got screwed.
Yeah. But I thought that was because I put the whole thing on my hand and made it walk across the table.
You spit on me man!
Something personal.
No.
Yeah, you are!
Oh, I don't watch soap operas. Excuse me, I have a life, y'know?
What are you guys woofing about?
Uhh Pheebs, I heard that. Can you put him on?
Ross! Ross! Ross, listen! Who are you kissing at midnight, huh? Rachel or Phoebe?
She said yes.
Hey!
No!
Hello.
What are you guys doing in here?
Dark red.
And-and there's no danger to her and the baby?
Oh, I don't know.... Yeah, can't do it.
Yeah, they're not coming.
Hey! Uh, Monica? Chandler? Can I talk to you guys for a second?
Seriously, Ross, you don't want in on this?
You liked it? You really liked it?
The Unbearable Likeness of Being!
I like those odds!
I'm gonna be an uncle! Come here!
What the hell are you talking about??
Alright, alright, hey y'know fair is fair, if you're right, you're right, what can I say, but hey oh no!
You really should have been more clear about that!
Yeah that'd be great! Thanks Pheebs!
Uh, well they might be a little mad at me over there.
I'm so bored! Stupid rain, we... we can't do anything.
Hey! It's Porsche!!
Just okay-Did you do it right?!
Okay!
That's right, mister, and I don't care how old you are, as long as you're under my roof you're gonna live by my rules. And that means no sleeping with your girlfriend.
Look, I got to apologize on the behalf of Carl.
Ok ok ok ok. Monica, we'll bring him, but only if he takes the Jaguar.
I look more like him than you do!
Oh my God!
Absolutely! I could be a vegetarian. There's no meat in beer, right?
Are you sure?
An annulment? Ross! I don't think surgery's the answer here.
Oh! I forgot you used to live here!
Yep, it's fat. I drank fat!
Hey-hey-hey, hey! You can't. Okay? Ever!
Hey everybody, look who's here! You remember my grandmother!
Oh, you should here me.
Without that, you just got "lame with women".
Oh, hey, Monica, we've got a question.
Yeah.
Good night!
Hey! We were just sayin', great apartment man.
Yeah, I gotta, I gotta go to my room too.
Hey!
Please don't fire my friend. Just let me talk to her.
Yes I do! And we're gonna go out, we're gonna have a good time, and take your mind off of childbirth and c-sections and-and giant baby heads stretching out...
Wow! Well, uh... Hey! I'm really happy for you guys! Congratulations! See you later.
Oh, you said it Mike. Aw! There's got to be a better way!
I am so sorry man.
Cause she uh, she steals stuff.
Hey! Did Chandler show up yet?
Hey! Y'know how we ah, save all those chopsticks for no reason we get when we get Chinese food?
Really?
Hi!
Oh, hey Katie! Everyone, this is Katie.
So then how could you I mean, how could you?!
No, it's not. I mean you-you made me your best man and I totally let you down!
Oh.
I do! So much! I can't stop thinking about her! I can't sleep, I-
Two pizzas?!
Aww, man, he took the five of spades!! Oh, no-no-no, here it is!
There was a ring, in a box, on my nightstand, after you left, it was gone!
I agree. I'm, like, in disbelief.
Okay! Okay, you're yelling again! See that?
They're ribbed for *your* pleasure.
You guys don't think I look 19?
Dude, I'm sorry. But hey, there's one spot left, right?
Uhh, my stunt double. Yeah, and y'know, he's getting a little too familiar for my tastes.
Bite me?
Well we'll see!
Now, wait a second! You make food and robots?
You sick bastards!
Everything doesn't sound fine!
No-no-no! No-no wait Rach, you know what would even be more fun? Telling them.
Oh well, she said we have nothing in common.
That's her! Okay, come on!
He hooked up!! Tell us about her!
Hey! Hey! Be careful around my Porsche!
Yeah. I'll uh, I'll call ya.
You're not gonna like it.
Hey.
Whoa! What are you doing here? How did your date go?
Hey!
All right, well I guess I'll just have to do what I do on dates.
You're not gonna let me buy the Knicks?? I can't believe you're taking this away from me!
Look.
Right, right, right, well, she wants to go to all this cultural places and I don't know how to talk about that stuff. You gotta help me out!
Thank God!
do you have any cake? >>> Joey's Subconscious So this is going pretty good. dinner was nice, got a lot in common. Victoria's secret huh we even like the same books. Oh now there's a scary painting. wait a minute I think I've been scared by that painting before. You know what this whole place look familiar I have definitely been in this apartment I know I've seen this weird plant before AWCH! It did that the last time. Oh my god, I've gone out with this girl before yeah we had sex on this couch and then on that chair and no. no we didn't do it hear which is weird because it seems like a perfectly good place.
Oh no! No-no, keep reading! The good part's coming up. Keep going.
Oh! Sorry. Uh, I've got those plans with Phoebe, why?
Yeah, I called the lady about that. I told her I was just joking. She was pretty nice about that.
No it isn't, I ate that.
Dude, stop talking crazy and make us some tea!
Pick me!!
You're blowin' me off for a monkey?
That's right, yeah.
I'm surprised you didn't go home wearing your lunch.
Ross, don't let her drink anymore!
Oh-ho-kay, I'm talking to the king.
With this ring? No contest.
You can't go out there.
I just want you to say it once in a while.
Fine! Have you ever got stuck in a pair of your own leather pants?!
Well, I'm pretty tired from lugging the trees around all day. Hey, Phoebe listen, you got this all wrong. Those trees were born to be Christmas trees, their fulfilling their life purpose, by, by making people happy.
We could climb Mt. Everest!
No! I am not a pervert! Okay? It's just... I just... Kinda...
Probably, yeah... I mean, maybe we should... hold off until we talk to Ross.
You can't have S-E-X, when you're taking care of the B-A-B-I-E!
I know, but I don't think that's what she wants.
So you've just married the one time then?
Yeah. Okay, what else? Rent!
Phoebs, that's OK. You took a big step today.
Rach, come on! They are announcing the numbers! My God, I can already feel myself changing. TV: "Here we are, the official Powerball numbers! We have 53"
Me too.
Hey, being you is finally gonna pay off!
I don't know! Maybe she's crazy!
Oh, nothing, no. It's an acting exercise, I'm practising my fake laugh.
G'night.
I guess.
How's that going?
Ohh, hey! Why don't you book a date for both of you at one of those romantic spas?
Yeah, you do!
What?!
Okay! We'll need a six-pack of Zima.
Not a problem.
Hey. I'm here for my eyebrow appointment.
It is.
Look, it's not about her. Okay? But seeing you two together just reminds me of what you did. And I don't want to live with some one who doesn't know what it is to be a friend. So, I'll see ya.
Man, this is a long drive! Are my eyes open? No!
Oh hey, here Pheebs.
That's right!
It's stuck!!!
I can't believe this Chandler!
That's right! By his uncle too!
Thanks.
Wha? Wha..aa? Let me get the father. Hey, we need a father over here! We need a father!
Audition? I thought you were gonna offer me the part.
Hey buddy, do you think I can borrow your uniform this Thursday?
Hey Chandler can I talk to you for a second .
We all hate Emily!
...Yeah?
I know, it was the best I could get out of them.
How could you do this to me Chandler?! This part could've turned my whole career around!
Oh hey! You got my parent's gift!
Yeah, and you know what? We could do a lot worse.
Hi I'm Joey. This is Chandler.
Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Or, or I'm the one who dates her.
I'll treat you real nice.
No, things are fine with Kathy. I'm having a late dinner with her tonight, right after my early dinner with Casey.
Wow! Sure! That's great!
Oh well-Hey-hey! Maybe, maybe uh, maybe this is a good thing. Y'know? It'll-it'll give you a chance to shake things up, play different characters. You're so talented.
Then I blame you! Yeah! That's right! You threw me off with all your slapping!
Hey, hey.
Okay, the last thing...
That's right, he almost could. Which is exactly how I got stuck there.
God, you're beautiful...why are we fighting this?You know you want it to happen as much as I do. Joey: I want you.I need you.Let me make love to you.
I know, I know..., but that's okay. I mean, we can control ourselves, we're not animals.
Sure.
How do you mean?
Look-look-look you guys, I need some help! Okay? Someone is going to have to convince my hand twin to cooperate!
Yeah. I guess so.
Oh hey listen I got us tickets to a Knicks game tonight.
I'm thinking we've got a bookcase here.
Oh, ain't that nice? The three of you trying on slutty lingerie together.
Yeah, I know exactly what she's goin' through.
Yep, this kiss thing is defiantly a problem, Mr. Beatty wants to see it again on Monday. Man, I gotta figure out what I'm doing wrong. Oh, okay, one of you girls come over here and kiss me.
Don't move! Don't go! I need you! My audition is tomorrow! Shah blue blah! Me lah peeh! Ombrah! . Pooh.
What?!
What?
Oh hey uh, be careful with that 3-D last supper, Judas is a little loose.
Okay, all right, this is how it's going to work. We're gonna give you hypothetical maid of honor situations and you will be scored on a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the highest.
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Let her dangle.
If he goes first he can!
Oooooh...
Hello?
All right.
Okay.
No, yeah, no, ok, but not yet. I don't wanna seem too eager. One Mississippi, two Mississippi, three Mississippi. That seems pretty cool. Hey, Angela.
As in Rosita does not move.
Okay dude! Hey you uh, you sent Kristen flowers.
Really? Me? Wow! I don't even know any huge gay people!
Yeah, she's totally good looking. I mean, if I met her in a bar, or something, I'd be buying her breakfast. You know, after having slept with her.
Yeah, but it's my wax.
What message?
Hey Rach, you uh, you want some sandwich?
Let's ride.
No, I didn't!
Yeah. And uh, I paid for the other half.
I did that too! They wouldn't give me her real name or her number. They said, "If I bothered them again they'd call the police." I said, "If you talk to the police, you tell them I'm missing a ring!"
So, you're just Bing?
Hey Rach! Hey, you mind if I read my comic books in here?
Doesn't seem like it's going to work, I mean...
Here you go!
Oh yeah, sure, no problem, I'll just-hold on one second. "Hey Timmy, I've got a surprise for you!"
No, I had sex in high school.
Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs!
Or... just get a card that has a poem already in it.
Looks like that no date pact thing worked out.
And?... AND?
Okay. Okay, okay, hey. There we go, let's get your feet up there. Good night, Kate. Sweet dreams. I'm gonna put this can right here in case you have to hurl.
Is something wrong?
Uh, uh, we'll flip for it. Ducks or clowns.
What do you mean?
And then, then he could use his teeth, his teeth to undo her dress, and, and, and bite her!
Wait a minute. That sounds a little familiar! Did they already do that one? 'Cause I think I read it!
You cuddled.
Oh, wow! I'm so sorry, ok? I promise, we'll do better next time!
Hey Pheebs, you know what? I was thinking... since you wrote a song, maybe I could do something for Emma using my talents!
Hey you too!
I really made you think about that thing uh?
Look Rach, my parents bought this fridge just after I was born, okay? Now, I have never had a problem with it. Then you show up and it breaks! What does that tell ya'?
Chandler, I didn't kiss her, he did! See what happens when you break the code?
Damnit! anybody got anything?
Yeah, my neighbor... Yeah, the brunette... She says you looked very pretty the other day in the green dress.
Yeah, I've had it.
All right, okay, this is great, uh, Chandler, you get behind the desk. And-and when she comes in hopefully, she won't recognise you because, well, why would she? Uh, okay, and then you buzz Ross and I. You be Mr. Gonzalez, and I'll be uh, Mr. Wong.
Well, it's complicated. She's with this other guy. For a long time. Someone from work, too. And I could never do that to the guy, because we're really good friends.
Yeah, you missed, 'Takes money to make money,' and uh, 'Don't make me come down there and kick your wall street butt.'
Uh-uh, excuse me, I do have to interrupt on Ross's behalf. I-I think the rule applies here y'know, since she has a chance to get on broad back...
Okay, you hide my clothes. I'm gonna do the exact opposite to you.
If you want some privacy you can use my hole.
I don't know! Yeah, I do.
Okay, five hundred dollars. What else?
Ahhhhhh, I didn't get the job.
Uh yeah-ye-ye-ye-ye-ye-l-l-l-l-l-look the-the-the only reason that I, that I came up to you before was because well, I'm really nervous about-about being you. Y'know if you can help me capture the essence of the character. Y'know? Help me keep Jessica alive. Please?
This is amazing.
I'm afraid I'm gonna need proof.
Done.
Yeah, well you didn't call and leave your grip size.
Okay, now. I gotta tell you, being on TV isn't as glamorous and exciting as you think.
Oh, man, I could totally get that part. 'I'm sorry, that seat is taken.'
Aaaah...
Hey hey! You dye your hair!
Boy, that guy's underwear sucks!
I know. And she's so sweet. I just wanna feed her grapes and brush her hair.
All right, what are we havin'?
Well, I think it's ridiculous that you haven't had sex in three and a half months.
Right-right up here.
She is?
Let's just say I took care of it.
It's not a cat!
Good luck.
Bijan for men? Bijan for men? Bijan for... Hey, Annabelle, Uh, listen, I was wondering if maybe after work you and I could go maybe grab a cup of coffee.
All right, listen, Ross... you like this girl, right?
Yeah.
What, are you crazy? When a blind man gets his sight back, does he walk around like this?
Yes you are. I think it may be time for my sponge bath. Sorry, I'm just so used to hitting on the extras. So, are you excited about your scene?
Oh sure-And hey, don't get me wrong, I am so happy for you guys. I just...I miss...hanging out...just-just us, y'know?
Don't you see what this means?! I can forget about that stupid movie. I'm gonna be a millionaire!
Oh I-I uh, found the keys and now I'm just polishing her up.
These new kids, they never last. Sooner or later, they all...stop lastin'. Listen, uh, what do you say I buy you that cup of coffee now?
Oh, I will.
I lie better then that, right?
I don't know how to play Cups.
Hey Erica, c'mon in.
Na-uh! Hey did anybody lose their keys?
So you're the gynaecologist?
Wow, really?
And she's back in the game.
That was one good minute!
I wish. No. After dinner, me, her, and Pepper all fell asleep in front of the fire. Well I woke up in the middle of the night and I saw that the fire was dying out. So, I picked up a log and threw it on. Or, at least what I thought was a log.
Yeah! Yeah! I mean I'm sorry, I wish I can take everybody, but y'know Chandler always supported my career. He's paid for acting classes and head shots and stuff and well this will be my way of paying you back.
IN LONDON!!!
This thing welded shut?!
Look, it's a nice gesture, it is. But it just feels like--
Okay. Okay. Umm...Ooh! Oh-oh, I got something. It's this story I came up with, very romantic. I swear any woman that hears it; they're like putty.
Oh uh-uh yeah, I think that.
Hey!
Yeah-yeah. And the craziest thing is that I just ate a whole pizza by myself!
I don't think so.
Hmm that's weird. I don't remember being in a move called benefits lapsed.
Wow, what-what do you think she wants?
Why not?! I'm hungry.
So I guess you all saw it.
Okay... Well maybe now I'm not okay with it not being okay.
Ascot!
What is wrong with me. It looked more delicious when it was a penis.
Yeah...
I'm Joey.
How?! When?!
Uh-uh nothing. I-I-I-I didn't want you to touch me cause I'm -I'm all sweaty from the workout. I better hit the shower. Oh my God!
Hey, this girl won't turn around and I can't tell whether she's hot or not, what do you think?
Why not?!
Yeah-yeah, yeah, with that-that uh, plumber girl...
Yeah, I thought I was pretty good too.
I still haven't gotten a check for your half yet.
Yeah well that's because uh...I stayed in my room. Yeah, you don't want to look in my hamper.
Hey, uhh, I need to talk to you.
Really? I don't...
No, I didn't!
Well, you lied again!
Good luck Phoebs.
Is this because I come over here without knocking and eat your food? Because I can stop doing that, I really, really think I can!
I know I would.
I have an audition for this play and for some of it I have to speak French. Which, according to my resume, I'm fluent in.
I don't know.
Hey Ross, listen, you know that right now, your baby's only this big? This is your baby. Hi Daddy!
Yeah! Why don't you stick around. You can sit right there.
That's 'cause sometimes I just do it through my wall to freak you out.
So what does that mean? Are you guys getting back together?
Give me $400!
No, I don't. It's like, ya know, you work your whole life for somethin' and you think that when you get it it's never gonna be as good as you thought it would be. But this so was. Ya know, it changed everything. Like the other day, I got this credit card application, and I was pre- approved. Huh? I've never been pre-approved for anything in my life.
Has it always been purple?
It's better! You can't go to a museum in your underwear!
What?
Wait a minute.
Yeah.
I just said that so you wouldn't let Ben do it! Look Ross, if anyone should step aside it should be Ben!
Come on man, you drove all the way up here.
I love living with you so much. I just wish things didn't have to change.
I did. I thought it'd be great. I figured I'd have like, time alone with my thoughts but, ya know, it turns out I don't have as many thoughts as you'd think.
That's mean! You really had me going there!
Hey. I just got off the phone with Estelle and guess what. I GOT THE LEAD IN A MOVIE!!!!!!
Thanks. But maybe later.
Ooooooh.
I never know how long you're supposed to wait in this type of a situation before you can talk again, you know? Maybe a little longer.
Ok!
Of course!
Hey!
Yeah he's lying. He looked down.
Yeah. It's a shame people can't visit there.
Yeah, look, we were just saying, this whole thing is really stupid.
Guys, do you think we should ask Ross to come along?
Yeah.
I'm takin' Ursula tonight. It's her birthday.
No kiddin', hmm.
Oh. What's, what's going on? Is it mom? Is she sick? Is it dad's heart? Is that a sandwich?
I'm telling you, Rach, Charlie is not right for me!
That noise can only me one thing.
Ahh Pheebs, you know you're still my number one girl.
What's up man?
If you go to a hotel you'll be...doing stuff. I want you right here where I can keep an eye on you.
No, I wasn't gonna ask you that, no.
She's gone.
Yeah, yeah. Hey, why don't you give a pull on that rope?
Okay, I'm all right, okay, but hey, could you just leave your lips?
That... never happens...
Hey-hey, Ross?
I can scratch that right off.
But.
Dude, I don't know.
All right, all right. "Damnit Braverman, it's right there on the chart!"
Okay, pick a card.
Ross. I was thinking we could just go down the fire escape.
Hey Pheebs! Hey!
Hey-hey.
Plastic spoons. Great.
Ma, I don't mean to be disrespectful, but... what the hell are you talking about?! I mean, what about you?
Let me explain to you how the human body works. I have to warm my stomach first. Eatin' chips is like stretching.
All right, what else?
Yeah.
And-and-and-and-and-and, and we're gonna be friends again!
I got it! Here we go.
He's got the body for it.
But I counted, you're not supposed to live here! Oh man!
Wow! Didn't know that.
Yes!
Ho-ho-ho, fried stuff with cheese!
Well no, I'm just in a coma. This must mean I have lines! Oh...
Okay.
You were right. He is funny.
He's doin' some thinkin'!
Tequila!!
Yeah.
That's fine. I'll just have a Tic-Tac to hold me over.
Hey, I didn't stalk her. I mean
Oh, now you're tellin' us how you feel.
Hey-hey dancer girl! Can I go to the bathroom? I just.. Here we go. Looking good Gellers!
What?!
Don't worry, there wasn't any sex in it or anything. I haven't dreamt about her like that since I found out about you two--ish.
Oh, I'm so sorry. I don't know any Spanish words.
What?! What's wrong with my eyes.
Why?!
Almost cried huh? Hear that Chandler? Almost cried!
What party?
No! Hey no! This is wrong you guys! Phoebe's our friend! Well, I'm not gonna watch it!
What?! I didn't touch a guitar!
Freaky.
I'm listening.
Gettin' drunk and going to a strip club.
Oh! I see what happened. It's because I was trying to repel you. Right? Believe me, you'd feel a lot different if I turned it on.
Huh.
Glove salesman!
Okay.
Have you kissed her yet? It's awesome! I could do it forever! Y'know what? She-she kisses better than my mom cooks!
Listen, I hope... that you know... I don't want you to see your father cry, GO TO YOUR ROOM!
Hey! Did you talk to Dennis about me yet?
What do you got there?
And that's Wednesday. Ohh.
Okay. Have a benefit.
The bigger half.
Hey.
Yeah, someplace nice. How much do you think I can get for my kidney?
Would you guys want to come down tomorrow and watch me tape the show?
Oh. Okay. Hey, can I ride this outside?
Hey, listen to me, listen to me...you are never ever gonna be alone. Okay? I promise that's not gonna happen.
Yeah, yeah, it's already generating Oscar buzz.
Oh yeah, dude, I totally understand. Usually after I have a baby with a woman I like to slow things down!
Hey, woah, let's go down there and get your hat back.
Yeah, I'm ready.
I went back to Riffs. I think Ursula likes me. All I ordered was coffee, she brought me a tuna meltt and four plates of curly fries.
See? That's a great smile! Easy. Natural. Now, pretend I have a camera. You're changing it!
What party?
What?
Yeah, Ross, way to ruin it. I was just going to get dressed.
Totally! I would love to spend New Year's with you.
Yeah, I'll have the Thai chicken pizza. But, hey, look, if I get it without the nuts and leeks and stuff, is it cheaper?
Who do you think its from?
Is it on me? I feel, I feel like it's on me! I got, hey!
Please, just-just, just go and talk to Rachel.
What the hell does a paleontologist need a beeper for?
Yeah, so, uh, so, uh, what's the deal with this father guy, I mean, if someone was havin' my baby somewhere, I'd wanna know about it, you know?
Ooh!
What? No, the only reason I'm going to their stupid new house, is so I can point out everything that's wrong with it, so they don't move. I'm gonna make them stay here.
Hey!
He can still catch her! Come on, get out of there! Get out of there!
All right, watch me! Okay, you time me. Ready?
So, does that mean the audition is off?
I don't know, but one of the extras sure did! Hey, listen Rach. Thanks again for coming down to watch my scenes!
Hey-hey dude, why are you changing the subject? Why? Will you make the call or what?
Definitely not invisible.
Oh no-no-no! No-no-no-no-no-no-no!
Hey you guys. Hey, you all know my dad, right?
Listen, I ah, I know it's a longshot. But, by any chance did she find that funny?
Estelle?
I mean if-if you're thinking it's a woman's bag, it's not. It's a man's bag!
Hey buddy! How's it going?
Just when I thought we could be friends.
I'll see you at 8:00.
Look Chandler, it was instinct! Okay? I just went for it!
Hey! Hiya!
Yeah? Well look Ross, you don't have to. Okay? It's not your fault I suck. I mean what kind of an actor can't even say, "Hmm, noodle soup."
Aww that's nice. Family should be there, huh? This is her wedding, happiest day of her life.
Now that's a thinker.
Hi Alex! And uh, as you can see my hands are not in my pants.
Well, I figured we're in another country, so it doesn't count.
Good luck, man.
Hey!
I don't know, you see somethin', you hear a word, I thought that's what it was. Let me see it again.
Okay, uh...sit down. Um... there's this woman that I like. A lot. But, uh...it can't happen.
I don't need to think about it. I was Dr. Drake Remoray. That was huge. Big things are gonna happen, you'll see. Ross, you still there?
Just casually slip it in, y'know lay the groundwork. Tell her uh, I'm a loner-No! An outlaw! Tell her she doesn't want to get mixed up with the likes of me.
Oh my God, you're back!
What's he doin' in my section?
Ah... Chick Jr.? Duck Jr.? Don't hide from mama!
Now, see, I don't believe any of that. I think once you're dead, you're dead! You're gone! You're worm food! ...So Chandler looks gay, huh?
I'm gonna take that book and beat you to death with it.
Maybe you need sex. I had sex a couple days ago.
Right this is staging.
Howdy partner!
Uhm... oh... I don't know, it's too hard.
But wait, wait, wait. Then, after I left her office, she caught up with me at the elevator and offered me an even bigger part.
It's him, not it!
It's my house-warming present for Monica and Chandler.
Hey!
Nice.
Or clowns. Oh, oh wait. That one's definitely Ben. Remember, he had that cute little mole by his mouth.
Yeah baby! No baby!
Maybe he found you flip-flop.
How long since you've seen a girl naked?
Hey! Who was up from 2 o'clock this morning until 5 o'clock this morning trying to get her back to sleep?
What?
I can't hear a word you're saying, my ears are ringing so bad.
Yeah. Uh, does this mean there's nothing to eat?
I Play Al Pacino's Butt. All Right? He Goes Into The Shower, And Then- I'M His Butt.
You could say that.
Oh-ho, you should get inside my head.
Oh.
I can do that, yeah. How is Friday?
Man you are incredible.
All right let's just do this.
Shhh! Not so loud, we don't wanna wake up, uh...
Well hey-hey if she needs any idea for costumes, she could be a bikini model, or a slutty nurse, or a sexy cheerleader huh-Ooh-ooh, Leatherface from The Texas Chainsaw Massacre-No-no-no! Slutty Leatherface.
We're the guys.
Hey, you know what? Don't worry, Pheebs! It usually takes me three takes too! Alright, eight.
I'm sorry! This never happened to me before! I'm an expert at taking off bras! I can do it with one hand! I can do it with my eyes closed! One time I just looked at one, and it popped open! I blame your bra!
Oh my God.
Hey.
I figure my character has kids.
Yes, but y'know what? It doesn't matter who knows what. Now, enough of us know that we can just tell them that we know! Then all the lying and the secrets would finally be over!
No no no, behind it.
Oh, you're fine, yeah, for a first job.
Oh! Well that's it! He's the last one to go. I'm locking you guys in.
That's what that was?! 'Cause that other thing? I thought you were on to something, but it did nothing for me.
Are you kidding me?! I love Archie! And the whole gang!
It's no big deal. Hey, y'know, you do what you gotta do. Right?
Ohh, a hunk of sandwich from last year.
Joey Tribbiani! From the wall! Okay, maybe this will jog your memory, huh? Huh? Okay eh-ah-anyway, I'm ready to go back up on the wall I'm the star of a new TV show.
Yeah!Hey, you just have to promise not to get yourself thrown out again.
Yeah.
Hey, you guys!
This sucks man! The last night you're here and I lose the two most important things in my life, the foosball table and $500.
Yeah, so no one touches the remote. And no one touches the TV!
Hey, how come, uhh, Chandler didn't come?
Well, I'm totally over it Chandler. Friends forever! Don't come out here!
Sure! But hey, you know this way sounds good too.
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa, I-I-Hey! I did not go out with your wife! Okay? I went out with her!
Ooh!
Okay, good to see you again.
Hey!
Sorry, I just, any excuse to tell that story y'know....
What do you need?
Yeah, she's been out there for twenty minutes, I'm surprised you didn't hear her on the way over.
Yeah. Uh, oh, OH, the best part, c'mon. Heh?
All right where's that turkey!
Oh! I got it! Ok, everyone pick a number from one to ten. Alright? Whoever gets the highest number gets to go first.
I like to see the previews. The candy.
Yeah! A little bit, yeah...
Mia Hamm?
Hey!
So uh, what are you guys doing?
I've never slept with someone for a part.
And remember whatever comes up first. Okay? And hurry, because ...
I don't get it. What happened? What about everything you said under the bridge?
All right! But uh, listen, what do you say we crank it up a notch?
Chandler, she doesn't understand a word of English.
Yeah.
Everybody's doing stuff!
Hey, I may never have kids, and somebody's gotta carry on my family name.
Do we need a cake?
What the hell are you talking about, "The south will rise again man."
So are you gonna start taking this thing seriously?
Yeah-yeah, and if I get it by day I'll Dr. Drake Remoray, but by night I'll be Joey Trrrribbiani!
Hey, you're ah, pretty good at this.
Well, she and I said from the beginning that we weren't gonna do anything unless you were okay with it. And clearly..
Okay, bye-bye.
Yeah, you can fire her, but I would call security, she won't go easy.
Hey well, you can't teach someone to be good with women. Y'know, that's why I never had any luck with Chandler.
Hey Chandler!
Hello?
Aw! Look at that, every inch of this stuff is glued down. It'd take forever to pry this up. You should ah, you should just leave it.
Hey Estelle, listen...
Y'know Terry, I-I don't really need to do this. I got my own cable TV series, with a robot.
Hey.
Ah, Kate?
Oh well, okay, good luck.
Naa, you keep it, you need the practice.
Uhm... ok. It's a store, like a supermarket. Oh! I see-I see what I did. Yeah, ok, ok, uhm... I'm writing in my...
Hey, Monica bought a bed from the Mattress King?
Hey, Ross, you're okay with that?
Who would you rather sleep with Monica or Rachel?
Miracle!
Guest.
Because you two were having sex!
I did?
There's gravy?
Man, I wish I had a nanny like you.
I just got this really weird message from Ross. He said turn on MTV.
What?
I can't watch this.
Yeah! Oh my God! Is this what it's like to be you?
I didn't tell him. I didn't know if you were telling people. This is back when I thought Kash was still people.
Yeah, I figure they'll love it at the new house, you know? It has that big backyard. And then, when they get old, they can go to that special farm that Chandler took the other chick and duck to.
Well...
Ooooooooooh, I slept with you! And you obviously remember me Hey! I still got it. so were good. I'll let myself out.
Excellent! Okay umm, doggy.
see ordinarily I would talk to her, but my confidence is shaken did I sleep with her? Did I not sleep with her?
Uh, well, kinda yeah. Like, remember last week when Alex was in the accident? Well the line in the script was, 'If we don't get this woman to a hospital, she's going to die.' But I made it, ' If this woman doesn't get to a hospital, she's not gonna live.'
I'm gonna go down there and teach that guy a lesson.
Hey! You're back!
No I'm not. Why would you say that? That's just mean.
Well, I-I might've said supergay.
Huh.
Well, y'know those special skills I have listed on my resume? I would love it would be great if one of those was true.
Well look, I'm breaking up with Katie so I had to put on some extra padding. Y'know? I mean, if she hits me when she's happy, can you imagine how hard she's gonna hit me when I tell her I'm taking away the Joey love?
Phoebe, could you do me a favour? Could you try this on? I just wanna make sure it fits.
Yeah. Hey, remember when she brought up that thing about the three of us?
Ooh! A tape with a girls name on it. It's probably a sex tape... Wait a minute... This says Monica... And this is Richard's apartment...
What?! He got me! Owwwwww!!!
And I got them a book on Karma Sutra for the elderly.
No, no. Nurse With Tray doesn't know Joey, she doesn't have time for friends. She gets in that operating room and she carries that tray to the doctor, because if she doesn't, people die!
What audition?
Oh really? So, 33 and still single, would you say you have commitment issues?
Hey, here you go.
Hey, it's great having you back. You know, stay as long as you want, and when does she stop crying all night?
Oh-ho-ho, yeah! Hey! Y'know what goes good with that?
You're kidding!
That's all right. Hey you guys, you know what's going to be great about the fishing trip this year? When my dad gets me out in the middle of the lake and gives me that, "Joey, what are you doing with your life?" stuff. I can say, "Well, I'm doing a movie with Charlton Heston dad. What are you doing with your life?"
Finally you guys made it. Pheebs, who the hell-uhuhh!
Uh, Pheebs, about your mom...
No, it's the pre-game. I'm gonna watch it at the reception.
Don't make me more nervous than I already am!
Right. Thanks. It's June. I'm outta here.
Listen also we're uh, we're watching the game here Saturday night, if people want to come over.
Uh, am I curious? I mean, I am as curious as... as... George!!
Wha-a how about this: Another table leaves, right? But there's still some food left on their place, okay, what's the restaurant's policy about people eatin' that?
Looks like someone IS the ladies!!
Yeah, but it's not gonna last. She's too much for me in bed. Sexually.
Chandler... hey... Rach... what's Hugsy doin' in the crib with Emma?
Hey!
Oh, just had a baby.
Yeah, in a poem maybe.
Yeah, calm down. You don't see Ross getting all chaotic and twirly every time they come.
Noooo. No-no-no, these babies sell themselves.
Man, we gotta do something about that guy. This morning, I caught him looking into our apartment. It creeps me out! I feel like I can't do stuff!
One pregnant woman at a time, please! I just want you to be okay.
I don't know. But hey, I know we can decide. Okay, I'm gonna ask you questions and you answer real quick. Okay?
Ohhhh! These seats are great!
Uhm... A penis model. Anyway, hey... Did you tell Chandler that some guy from work is the funniest guy you've ever met?
Yeah, like a moth to a flame, I'm telling ya. Okay all right, so now you go.
The reactor's gonna blow in three seconds, we're never gonna make it!
And for Ross, Mr. Sweet-tooth.
Well, I'm just-if the paste matches the pants, you can make yourself a pair of paste pants and she won't know the difference!
Sure.
Yeah, why don't you move in with me? It'll be great! We could stay up late, watch movies, and you know about Naked Thursday's right?
That-that is a good trick.
Ow, I'm just going over the script now! You wanna read lines with me?
We can't, alright? We're sorry. You have no idea how sorry, but... We promised we'd find this monkey. If you see him, he's about yea high and answers to the name Marcel, so if we could get some pictures of you, you'd really be helping us out.
Ooh ooh ooh ooh, there's no room for milk!
What?!!
OK, uh.... listen, there's something I want to talk to you about. The network casting lady...
Phew, close one.
It looks like a women's purse.
You know what, you guys? It's their first time, why don't we just forget about the money, alright?
Well I had a great time! Learned how to bake, ate great food, that's the first A I've gotten since seventh grade, and I didn't have to sleep with the teacher this time.
Hey you guys.
So, we're walking down the street and I turn to you and I say, "Hey, let's go hang out at Totally Nude Nudes," remember? And then, and then, you turn to me and say, "Nah, let's just hang out at your place." Well, that was a nice move dumb ass.
Waiting for my Grandma to finish my laundry. What about you?
Really?!
Do you know something?
Great, well, I'm happy for ya. Alright that's it. He just comes in here, Mr. Jonny Neweggs, with his, his, his movin' the mail and his, his 'see ya pals'. And now there's no juice. There's no juice f or the people who need the juice and want the juice. I need the juice.
No-no! No! No! You don't tell a Broadway guy that! Now he just thinks I'm a soap actor.
Six years? Wow... It's almost as long as highschool...
Okay...
Oh, and plus I'm 1/16th Portuguese.
Well, you're way sounds a lot better than mine. Yeah. Yeah! It's not that I'm a bad actor...
Well.. hey, you know what else I could use? There's a scene where Drake sneaks into Olivia's bedroom, and she doesn't know he's there - which never happened with us! And he knows he shouldn't be there, but he just wants to look at her... you know? And I remember all those mornings before you even put on your make-up, when I would think to myself, my God, she...is... beautiful... and it hurts so much, cuz I knew I could never tell you but it was worth it just to be there looking at you. Joey: Thanks dude!!!This is GREAT!! Closing credits.
What a bad idea!
Why would you ruin it, who was that hurtin'?
Ah-ha-ha, you guys owe me big time.
Oh, uh... don't forget your coupon. .
Bye-bye!
What?
Whoa-whoa, but her birthday isn't like for another month.
I got that! I forgive ya! Don't come out here!
Uhh, just a minute officer!!
Hey, I gotta! Unless...
Hey Ross, I'm aware of what I owe.
More foosball?
Yeah, it must've fallen out a few blocks back. I just figured we hit a dog.
What?!
What about the chick?
Noooo... Three Blind Mice goes like this...
Hey!
First of all, Utah? Dude, you can't just make stuff up!
Why don't we just go on two.
Who said it was for you?
Uhuh.
So I can do it?
Whoa, I'm not done.
Why don't you go see Frankie? My family's been goin' to him forever. He did my first suit when I was 15. No wait, 16. No, 'scuse me, 15. All right, when was 1990?
No.
The country.
It's like, you got so many lines to learn so fast, that sometimes you need a minute to remember your next one. So while you're thinkin' of it, you take this big pause where you look all intense, you know, like this.
Oh, oh! Any chance any of this happened in a "Galaxy far, far away"? .
Look forget it forget it... I can't do it.
Okay! How you doin'?
Okay!
I know. It was so cool when I was up there before. Me and Jim Belushi would just be crackin' up about something... Then I get fired off of Days Of Our Lives and he takes me down. Now he's just laughing at me. Look at him, that smug Belushi bastard, I'll...
Things that go "tssst" when you put them out.
Yeah, that's sad. Mashuga nut?
Really? A purse?
Ross? You okay?
You've got to pick a pocket or two. Boyyyyssss, you've got to pick a pocket or two..........
Sure, I know lots of girls.
So y'know Ross it's funny 'cause, you look familiar to me too. Have you ever been married?
And you never knew she was a lesbian...
Seriously, that's your fantasy? To invest it?
Just pull on it.
Ma?
I'm sorry, it's the pigs. they're reluctant to get in the blankets!
Dude, dude! I think you're losing it.
Great!
I now pronounce you... husband and wife.
I don't know! But it's the same!
See, didn't I tell ya these pillows would be a good idea?
Yeah good luck, good luck.
Hey.
I figured, take a guess, help a charity, free boat!
Phoebe!
He said that he wasn't gonna apologize because you guys are living here illegally, so instead what he's gonna do is have you evicted-I'll see you later.
You do?
Age?
Dude, are you okay? And when are the fajitas gonna be ready?
It's no big deal, okay? Phoebe and I talked about it. It's just a crush! It's going to go away! Dude, you gotta rearrange your bubbles! Oh!
Heads.
Yeah? Maybe we should talk about that for a little while!
Eh! There you go.
Yeah, isn't that a cool name?
Hey!
No-no-no, no it's uh, it's okay.
Yeah, I know what you mean. I mean, sometimes...
Hello.
No.
You got pregnant for funny?! Dina...if he's funny...laugh! All right, I'll be back in a little while! You stay here!
Oh, she's uh-uh really sick.
Yeah, I guess it is. And so... I'm gonna get on this spaceship, and I'm gonna go to Blargon 7 in search of alternative fuels. But when I return, 200 years from now, you'll be long gone. But I won't have aged at all. So you tell your great-great-granddaughter to look me up, because Adrienne... baby...I'm gonna want to meet her.
Yeah. Whew, it's hot with all of this stuff on. I ah, I better not do any, I don't know, lunges.
Dad, dad.
So that's why I feed my dog Purina One! Pick up a bag today!
This sucks, I was just up by that much!
Hey! Is the show still on?
You should see the treatment I get when I'm with that car! People are friendly; they-they wanna talk, and not just about the car! One guy gave me advice about my equity investments.
It'll kill him. I mean it'll, it'll just kill him.
That's a uh, that's a tough combination.
Yeah baby!
Cool.
Don't worry, you guys, we're gonna get you out of there.
Well, may I ask for one example?
Uhh, are you saying that you're not entirely happy about this?
Get him a bone, get a bone. You gotta bone?
No, I-I-I wasn't making fun of you, honestly, I-I think you were great in those commercials.
Any one of the brilliant actresses nominated for this award tonight deserves to take it home. Unfortunately only one can. The nominees for Best Supporting Actress are from Passions Erin Goff. From One Life to Live Mary Loren Bishop , from All My Children Sarah Mchann, and from Days of Our Lives Jessica Ashley. And the winner is......Jessica Ashley from Days of Our Lives. Uh, unfortunately Jessica couldn't be with us tonight so I'll be accepting this award on her behalf. And I'm sure that Jessica would like to thank my parents who always believed in me. She'd also like to thank my friends, Chandler, Monica, Ross, Phoebe, and Rachel who's sittin' right there!
Well, why do you call him Gandolf?
What... for how long?
O K.
Uhh, 11!
Hey!
Ok, ok! Fine! You can come, but don't tell anybody else. It's up on the roof at 8.
She's this really boring woman. She's a teacher!
All right, look I'm sorry you guys, but it's just that I gotta get these new head shots made. And they're really expensive, y'know? I'm down to like three! Well, actually two 'cause one of 'em I kinda blackened in some teeth-Why did I do that?!
That was a good one. For a second there, I was like, "whoa."
Check it out!! Jam crackers!
Yeah, she broke up with me.
Hey Pheebs! Listen, this wooden box keeps sliding out from under the seat. What-what is it?
"I just wanna go back to my cell. 'Cause in my cell, I can smoke."
Yeah.
Hey!
Wow, it's really long.
Heh, heh. It was nothin'.
Okay, okay, fine! Make jokes, I don't care! This is a big break for me!
Look! Oh! Is that the Pope?!
Hey-heeyyy - Look at that, it's a Christmas miracle!
No, no, no... what do... you can't do that to him!
Yeah. All right, now give me your best shot.
Hey!
The Metsss!
Chandler, come on nothing even happened!
Me too. Yeah, this place is great. I'm so happy for you guys. Although, you know, I hope you like fungus.
So, so is she still going to Paris?
No?
Have a seat. Last night, I tried to welcome you into my family... and instead, you disrespect me... I cannot allow this.
Yeah... Now I have something...
Is that a sandwich?!
It-it doesn't?
and who's fault is that.
A monkey.
Come on, they're close.
That's it? You know, it seems all you do lately is drop the ball.
I'm mad at you for leaving! You're nothing but a big leaver. Big leaver with a stupid suitcase.
If you didn't want to play, why did you come to the party?
What?
Not the other one?
How about Tony's? If you can finish a 32-ounce steak, it's free.
Somebody wanna help me out here?
So you ah, ready for our last practice?
Hey! Ah!!
Yeah...
Hey guys!
Look, maybe I need to try a real teacher! Right here! Here! Andy Cooper, he teaches guitar and look ooh, there's a nice picture of him with a little kid and THE KID'S GOT A GUITAR!!!!!!
Yes.
Yeah, in my third drawer on my dresser. You don't want to lose that.
What?! Why?!
I wanna be mr. Wigglemunch.
Okay, great.
I would say, "Woman, please!"
Yeah, whatever you need. Hey, you wanna go home?
All right, how about the ladybugs?
You got it.
Isn't there any way you can keep him?
I didn't look at it. Stupid baby's head was blocking most of it.
Well, I guess he says that because they were on a break when it happened, that she should of forgiven him by now.
Well what do I know?! I'm not a doctor!
How are ya? How are ya? Where are your babysitters, huh? Why's the bedroom door closed?
Well he actually saw you a little bit too.
Of course it's true! How else would you explain all the weird stuff that's been going on?
No! No... and, for the record, I've also never given her a frosting from a can!
What?!
So what, like people are gonna come in and think, "Uh-oh, I'm outside again?" Of course!
Date of birth?
Look, come on you guys, you said you were gonna try! All right look, I came over here to invite you guys to a movie with me and Janine.
You lied to me!
No. But I got Knicks tickets for you, me, and Chandler.
Thank you.
This one right here.
Pheebs, I am so sorry! I know I promised you a fun road trip with your friend and I didn't deliver. But-but-but now I know that you think being awake is an important part of friendship! So, so, so I will strive to-to stay awake for as long as I know you.
All right they got water, orange juice, and what looks like cider.
Yeah.
Not like him, per-se, just not un-like him.
I've got cold feet.
Thanks man.
Excuse me, Aaron? Hi! Umm, I have a little problem with the schedules. Originally, I wasn't supposed to work today, and I have this wedding that I really have to be at. It's my best friend's, and I'm officiating so I really can't work past four.
Oh-oh! So that's the way it's gonna be huh? Yeah I can break the rules too y'know!
Ross has some big thing to tell everyone.
Ok! All right, well... I'm gonna see if I can get a room for the night and I'll... I'll see you later!
Hey! What's up?
She was kidding about that right?
Oh well, hey, Joey's loveable too! But the thing about Joey is, if you need him, he'll be there.
What?! What good is that gonna do anybody?
Hey, finished my recommendation. Here. And I think you'll be very, very happy. It's the longest I ever spent on a computer without looking at porn.
Hey Gunther.
It was different for you guys! I mean, I mean, you were both in the same place, right?
What?
Uh.
Come on Rach! No one saw me take it! There was a whole table full of 'em.
Come on you guys, come on please-please just give her another chance, huh? She'll come around I promise.
And Chandler I can't believe I let you pay for this one. Thanks man.
Relax. Here hold this . This old stuff just comes right off.
They let you get married when you're drunk! Most people who get married in Vegas are drunk!
Hey! What are you guys doing here? I thought you'd be out partying with Gandel-worf.
I know.
What?
Hey.
Hey, here's a thought, Ross.
All right relax, look I'll pay you with the money from the acting job I am definitely gonna get thanks to you.
No-no.
I think I left a donut up here.
Uh, really good. Really good. Yeah, I should be ready to kill myself any day now. Wow, you sure found that quick. I just-I wish I didn't feel this way about Rachel anymore, y'know? I wish things could go back to normal. I mean, I love living with her and God, helping out with the baby is just amazing, but now I think...I think Ross feels left out. Y'know? When I had to take Rachel to the hospital, the doctor thought I was the father. God... You should've seen the look on Ross's face. By the way, I have no idea what I'm doing here. For all I know I'm just locking it more. Oh hey, did you try opening it with a credit card?
Nooo. No, no, ah, are you sure it wasn't something that sounded like Ginger, like ah, Gingeer?
Oh yeah, yeah, she's great, but... I kinda got the feeling that she was sort of... coming on to me. And I definitely would get the part if I would've... you know... if I would have sent the Little General in.
Rach! Hey! It's fine! You're at Joey's!
Okay, so that's another five hundred. Five hundred and five hundred, that's...
Hey!
That sketch you mentioned? Might it have looked a little something like this?
Bye, Pheebs!
Great! Roomie!
Uhm... Yeah... this uhm... raccoon came in...
I was?
I'm 30!
Yes! I win again! Ha-ha! That's like 500 bucks you owe me! Whoo-ho-hoo! $500 that is a loooot of electricity! Whoo-ho-ho! I gotta buy some food.
Well, I was thinking about that and I, I think the best way would be, to not.
Yeah.
Good-good, okay, sprinkle some of that on your legs, it'll absorb some of the moisture and then you can get your pants back up.
Who's seven?
Yeah-Hey, don't worry, she's a terrific girl. And hey listen, could you do me a favor? When she comes out could you just mention that I'm not looking for a serious relationship; that'd be great.
Does it have to be a whole day?
Sure! What's up?
Damnit Carl!
Hey!
Just pickle.
Oh, God!
Phoebe, that's crazy. When I first met you, you know what I said to Chandler? I said, "Excellent butt, great rack."
Sure, I can hang out 'til I have to meet ya. What uh-How come you're not going?
That's not what I said. Okay, I just meant...
Yeah, right.
Yeah, like you could find something as sophisticated as this.
I am those things, yeah.
What-But you saw the show!
He broke up with Julie. Well, go hug her, for god's sakes.
Uh-huh. This and a bunch of bubble wrap. And, some of it is not even popped!
It's never gonna happen.
Ross! Ross! If you're going to the airport, could you pick me up another one of those Toblerone bars?
Oh don't listen to him, he's just some guy who really wants the apartment, but I don't think he's gonna get it.
Good for you. Uh, quarters or rolls of quarters?
Well, that is usually what I would do. But I just never thought you'd be on the receiving end of it. How could you do this?!
Just kiddin,' I'll talk to them, you distract Rach.
Me too, but I guess I do have a couple of more-
Well, I didn't realize until I got home. I wasn't gonna walk all the way back down here with one shoe! Y'know what? I'm gonna go find that guy's car and leave a note on the windshield.
These little women. Wow!
Takes it out of you?
Y'know what? This is not fair to her. Let's just forget the tape!
Yeah, they're great seats too!
I really doubt that.
Oh that's terrible. I'm-I'm really sorry.
Well anyway, the guy they wanted backed out and now they want me! I start shooting today!
See you in 2003.
Hi!
Ah!
Actually, I didn't know the magazine was paying for it. Wouldn't have mattered, I'm doing this for the fans, not for the free food.
Oh, you wouldn't know a great butt if it came up and bit ya.
Hey!
Let me know about that coconut phone, it might great for the boat.
Growth!
Okay, uhh, would you rather be too wet or too dry?
No.
Night.
Yeah.
Can I use your phone? Yeah, the number for a Sidney Marks, please.
Hey.
Hey!
All right, I know! I know. Yeah, it'll be okay.
Comb my eyelashes.
All right, look, you got to help me out, ok? Look, I have the magic marker, I want you to fill in the skinny one soI don't look stupid for my pictures.
And that'll get rid of my wisdom?
That's right! I'm taking the essence.
Hey!
$200? Are you sure Pheebs? I mean, after what Sesame Street did to ya?
No dude, Ross tore up the tickets!
Wow, that's in like 20 minutes. You'd better get dressed.
Then why are you wearing Monica's jacket?
Yes! Yes, I did.
You could drink the fat.
Yeah.
How come Richard looks so much cooler with one of these than me?
What? Mine aren't tinted.
No-no-no, I think I'm gonna see how things go with Kathy. She's pretty cool.
Not anymore. So anyway, how do you want to pay me?
No! She had the ring on, she seemed so excited, and then she took her breast out.
Alright, alright. I'm around. Go ahead.
Well, when it's not right, you know it.
Uhh....
I can't! It-it's stuck!
If you get a second, find out where she got that cheeseburger.
I'm sending back all this stuff that Chandler bought out of guilt.
Ugh. Now if a cow should die of natural causes, I can have one of those right?
Oh, great! Can you believe I found it on the second floor?
Ohhh. I thought it was like Long Island.
Oh!
Don't worry, Chandler, it's not a globe of the United States.
Yeah!
She's mad because I know today's her laundry day and that means she's wearing her old lady underpants.
C'mon, you're going out with the guy! There's gotta be something wrong with him!
Okay, look, I think we have to tell Rachel she messed up her dessert.
Yeah, but for a one-year-old. What's the point... the other day she laughed for like an hour at a cup. Just a cup with a picture of Elmo on it dressed as a farmer. And he's standing next to this cow and the cow says "El-moo"! Yeah... that's a funny cup!
Oh well, the little girl who lives here made me feel a lot better about the whole thing.
Really? Oh uh, oh just give me five more minutes with it.
Why would I do that? It took three guys to get the thing in there!
So let me get this straight. If you go with Bonnie tonight, you're doing the smart, healthy thing and moving on.
Hey.
Uh... Charlie and I broke up.
Havin' some trouble?
Good luck.
Anyone mind if I save this?
Hey, don't get religious on me, ok. A guy in your position needs to be a little better at relaxing. You know. Why do you think we have the comfortable chairs? Huh...come here...sit down. Ready? Ahh!! Ohh, yeah!! Huh?!
What? What the hell am I doing? You just broke my fridge!
Hey look Ross, you need to understand something okay? I uh...I am never gonna act on this Rachel thing, okay? I-I would never do anything to jeopardize my friendship with you.
Hey, maybe that's for the best.
Ugh! I don't know what I'm going to do! I called the company that sent and th-they don't care! Then I called 9-1-1 and they laughed at me, if this isn't an emergency, then what is?
Ross has a boyfriend.
Excellent! Let's play Bamboozled! Chandler, you'll go first. What is the capital of Columbia?
Well, this is awkward.
So, you're not mad at me for getting fired and everything?
Wait a minute, you can't go to Tulsa. Maybe you forgot, but we've got tickets to the Jets game next week.
Done.
This is so exciting for her. Well, I'll let you two fash...ists get down to business.
Oh, OK.
I can't believe it. When you guys come back, you're gonna have a baby! That is so weird!
Oh, it's Ross's bachelor party.
I know, I know. And when they moved back in together, I figured y'know, that's where things were headed.
Me too! Me too! Me too!
Hey.
Yeah, I know.
Pantyhose! Y'know? They way they start at your toe and go all the way up to here... I should go take these off shouldn't I?
Why not?
Okay, it all comes down to this. Whatever happens, happens. Destiny.
People, people, people.
In a carriage!
Hey guys! What 'cha been doin'?
Which we're still keeping under our hats!
I'm sorry man, I tired, I really did.
I'm gonna miss you, you're the hottest roommate I ever had.
Thank you!
Oh! How's it going?
About what?
Will the stable boy never get the princess??
Well, I couldn't do it. I told her I didn't want to get the part that way.
Fire trucks!
No way! Mr.Salty is a sailor, all right, he's got to be, like, thetoughest snack there is.
Hey, imagine if I never got fired off Days Of Our Lives! Oh-hey, there's Carol again!
Hey uh, what's with the candy?
Yeah, yeah, I met this woman.
Oh uh, I don't know the boat way to say this, but uh never!
Dan just moved in downstairs. Yeah, he just got back from like this four-month trek in the Andes. Nice fella.
Really? In the moment, I really wanted to kiss you too. In the moment.
Uh, yeah... This guy at work got me excited about going in on an emu farm. That'd be kinda cool huh? Pitchin' in on the weekends, helping to plant the emus...
You're right, I'm sorry. You're right.
We gotta get more of that.
Alright!
I can see why, nice shirt!
Right, I go-, I got it.
You wanna know wh...? You wanna know why?
Look, can I just stop you right there for a second? When people do this I don't really know what that means. You were saying?
Hey, that coupon expires, you know.
Warm milk and Excedrin P.M.
Yeah, so.
You won't boss me around anymore?
Hair transplant.
R-R-Richard said he wants to marry you?! And-and Chandler's tellin' ya how much he hates marriage?!
Oh yeah. I rubbed a magazine on myself earlier.
Yeah you see umm, well, I'm an actor. Right? So I gotta keep my emotions right at the surface y'know? See what I'm saying? I gotta lot of balls in the air. Y'know what I mean? It's tough! Guys like me, y'know, you wander around, you're alone...
Well! What happened?! Did we miss it?
Great. You got anything that's not Ralph Lauren?
Monica, you have to do some damage control here, okay. 'Cause he's feeling like...
Oh, is today the day you're gonna tell them about you two?
Really?
All right! But, you do it with me once.
It's my VISA bill. Envelope one of two. That can't be good.
No, no!
Ah! I'm an actor! I can memorize anything! Last week on "Days" I had to say "Frontal temporal zygomatic craniotomy".
Yeah, it's mine.
Well, is it, like, a little annoying, or is it like when Phoebe chews her hair?
Cool.
Come on Ross! Look, I-I don't have any brothers; I'll never get to be a best man!
Chandler, if it really hurts that bad you should just tell her.
Phoebe?
And I ate the food, I had the fish, it was good, yeah. It was good, yeah...
Merry Christmas!!
I'm crazy about her.
gesundheit.
I can't take any...
Hey Kash. Uh hey-hey this is Ross. Ross, this is Kash.
How come the writing is in Spanish?
No.
Hi uh, I'm Joey Tribbiani and with all do respect I'd like to donate some fluids.
Yeah uh, Phoebe! Look umm, I want to apologize about before, okay? We were being jerks. Parker's a nice guy and I'd like to get to know him.
Come on! you...
That's nice.
Alright, alright. Woah, someone's flossing.
Queens.
Well, you must be new here. Why don't we get a table and I'll buy you a drink.
Nothing! Well, I-I got this blinding pain in my stomach when I was lifting weights before, then I uh passed out and uh, haven't been able to stand up since. But um, I don't think it's anything serious.
Great! Thanks.
This is your place?
Okay. Can I squeeze your ass?
Look, just because I know about you two, doesn't mean I like looking at it.
Oh, like you've never gotten a little rambunctious with Ross.
Sweepin'. Why? Turn you on?
Yeah.
Hands! It is absolutely essential that you tell me what room the man my assistant described is staying in. He's a patient of mine, I've been treating him for years!
Hey Rach listen, no matter what this guy says I want you to know you're not gonna be alone in this.
Thanks.
Hey! Tall guy! Hey, listen, I wanted to talk to you about that girl that you're dancing with.
Hey Ross! That art stuff worked, you hooked me up.
So, tell me. Was it like you and Chandler, and then you and me, or you and me and Chandler?
I don't know! I haven't totally decided how to talk on my boat yet.
I know what it did! Nothing.
Yeah, I know!!!!
Wait, wait. Do you hear that?
Hey. So where's Mon?
You're ready?
All right, but in the future...
Yeah-yeah, I noticed that! Is that 'cause she's so passionate?
No, no, I didn't mean you. But, you believed me, huh?
And, uhh, maybe the watering can there.
Heyyy.
No, I don't think so.
...Ninety-five, ninety-six, ninety-seven. See, I told you! Less than a hundred steps from our place to here.
Oh well, the powerball lottery is upto 300 million and they don't sell tickets here in New York, so...
Incredible! I met the director this time and you'll never believe who it was.
What's my little chef got for me tonight?
Whoah, boy, hockey was a big mistake! There was a whole bunch of stuff we could've done tonight!
All right, he likes you back! Huh? Told ya, you should go for it!
Yeah, yeah, and the Indians taught the Pilgrims what it meant to be hot in the new world!
That was good beer.
Oh, just, y'know.... science.
Interesting. all right I'll go out with her again and try to get past it OH SALT BLOATY!
Sorry, sorry.
Good, me too. Eggs and milk are in the fridge. Thanks.
Yeah, come on, think about it. You're 18, okay, she's 44, when you're 36, she's gonna be 88.
Morning, hey, you made pancakes?
I don't know, but I don't like what I'm hearing!
But I was Dr. Drake Remoray. How can I go from bein' a neurosurgeon to drivin' a cab?
Hey, Chandler, when you see Frankie, tell him Joey Tribbiani says hello. He'll know what it means.
Oh, a couple of nurses asked them out. Maybe they're with them.
No that's not what I was going to say at all. No, what I was going to say is when you're 90 you'll still have the memory of what it was like to be with a 20-year-old.
What's wrong?
Uh, Pheebs, how long do you think this lady'll be with us?
The Mr. Bowmont's here!!!
I wish. See, I guess another thing I probably should've told you about Ginger is that she kinda has a ah, artificial leg.
All that stuff you just said? I want that!
Yeah, yeah. I've got tons of stuff I could do. I'm gonna hit the beach, go swimming...
Or not. Uh, Rach, why don't you just move in with me?
Oww! Big ring!
Well, that-that-that's it? You're gonna, you're gonna put it on your self or anything?
I did?
Here, I brought you some flowers.
Beth is really, really sick.
Rach, you're killin' us here, will ya serve the dessert already? Those drunken dancers are waiting!
What is it? Hey!
Yeah, I guess, but what's like heads and what's tails?
Hey!
So what's it gonna be?
Well, I've been better. But, I'm all right. So you like her huh?
Oh thanks, thanks! Now, I really have to get.
But Rachel has an apartment.
Tribbiani.
Uh huh, sure, yeah. How can you not remember me?
What? You never said anything about an audition!
They're here already?
I got a big date coming up, do you know a good restaurant?
Well, back to square one.
Chandler, you have to start getting over her. All right, if you play, you get some fresh air, maybe it'll take your mind off Janice, and if you don't play, everyone will be mad at you 'cause the teams won't be even. Come on.
Hey, what's up?
What?! How could you do that, how could you think she was Mary-Angela?
Alright.
Don't stop! Move the bowl further away! Ross could make that shot!
Yeah, or you can teach him a lesson. Y'know? What you could do is you could rub something that really smells on your butt, all right? Then, when he goes to smack ya, his hand will smell. Now what could you rub on your butt that would smell bad?
So we'll leave before it's over, we'll be back in time.
Choose, you jackass!
Well I uh, got what I came for. I'll uh, I'll see you guys.
Yeah?
Yeah, they're mine.
You forget how many great songs Heart had.
Y'know what's more generous than that?! Fifty percent! Y'know what's even more generous than that?!!
Well, I don't know!!
Sure, it looks stupid now, there's no music playing.
After she gave me that big speech?! She goes and makes a date with a guy on the same night she has plans with me? I think she's trying to pull a fast one on Big Daddy!
Hey what do you say, we move this onto the likes of the couch?
Me too. Alright, whattaya got.
Fine. Gang up on me! I got you all right where I want you.
Really? She... she loves me?
Ok! Stop it you guys! Stop staring! You're freaking me out!
Uh.. is it ok that I still think it looks delicious?
Well it hit me anyway! And it would've hurt a lot less if I had finished that last beer.
Hey-hey, hold on, this isn't some kind of like girly dance. All right, it's like a sport, it's manly!
Did I say you could smell it?!
In a minute!!
All right.
I don't know who made you the boss? All right? We invented this game!
Not now! These are my Thanksgiving pants!
I'll have you know that Gloria Tribbiani was a handsome woman in her day, alright? You think it's easy giving birth to seven children?
Did she just ask me out on a date?
Well, since you ask. They want me back on Days of Our Lives!
Hey, listen Pheebs. I was just talking to the director, and he was thinking, maybe this time you don't hit Drake, you just wait on the tables?
AWCH! That's why.
No we weren't!
Hey! As soon as it stops raining we have got to go snorkeling! Some kid told me about the sea turtle and, if you blow bubbles in its face, it chases ya!
Oh my God. Hello?
It's the big night! We wanted to wish you good luck!
No-no-no! We gotta go! Come on! Here we go.
Sure! It flushes it.
No, no, look. All I'm saying is that you're my agent, ok? And you're not getting me into any auditions and I'm tired of it.
Hey-hey, check it out! Check it out! Ugly Naked Guy has a naked friend!
Yeah! Yeah. I'll be all right.
Oh, that poor bastard.
I've gotta see this. All right Ugly Naked Guy!
I need to talk to you about Charlie.
Ah. Hm. Wanna go to bed?
No, couldn't care less.
Hey!
And a 50. Huh, these must be Chandler's pants.
All right look, Ross, he's right. Emily's great, she's great! But this way too soon, you're only gonna scare her!
Well, thank you. So, can we play 20 Questions now? I've got a really good one! I've been thinking about it since Kansas.
Now go! 'Cause you can still catch her! And Merry Christmas from you're secret Santa!
Hey! Don't do the crime if you can't do the time.
Just now, after acting class. At first I thought she was doing some kind of scene, that's why I let people watch.
Yeah.
You're kiddin'.
Oh yeah! I got in there myself once. My roommate bet me five bucks that I couldn't, and then he stuck a board through the handles that locked me in. Yeah. It was funny 'til I started feeling like I was in a coffin.
Question. Was ah, 'Egg the Gellers!' the war cry of your neighbourhood?
Please!
Okay, what do you have a fear of if you suffer from this phobia, Tris...Holy cow, that's a big word. Trisc... Seriously look at this thing. Chandler, how do you say that?
Uh so, will-will I be reading the same scene again?
So uh, what's your name?
I did do it, I'm a professional.
Oh man! They-they just redid my make-up!
Hey!
Hey! No! Get your France-going-arms away from me.
I understand.
He said "erectus"!
No, I said fun!
Phoebs, he's just a little dog. Ahhh.
This is crazy.
Dude!
Hey, Rach? Sorry to interrupt but umm, Phoebe wanted me to talk to you about a trip or something.
All right, put your 20 bucks down. First one to find the tasty treat wins. Okay?
Of course you do! I saved him! You're mad at me! It all adds up! You want Ross out of the picture.
Know what was great? The way his smile was kinda crooked.
But this is a two line part, it's like takin' a step backwards. I'm not gonna do this.
Well, this-this-this was great. Didn't everybody have a great time?
Yeah you do!
Occupation? Dinosaurs.
I won, hey!
Is there anything we should know about the apartment?
All the way to the airport huh? You know that's over 30 miles, that's gonna cost you about so bucks.
What're you doin' here? Aren't you supposed to be out with Rachel?
That's it, just hey. Like at the end of a dance, HEY! Hey. He-hey.
All right! So that's it! It's over! Everybody knows!
Okay, first-first of all, you want to make it look spontaneous. I look down , look down, keep looking down; then I look up. See? All right, now you try. Look down , you're looking down, keep looking down...
Um, my present!
That's crazy!
Sure, no problem. Ooh-Hey, donuts!
Yeah! I totally forgot I'm supposed to be there. I can't believe I forgot. I usually write stuff like this on my arm. Oh! Stupid long sleeves.
Ahh! There's gotta be a way. I mean, you know, if Monica and Chandler move out here and now Phoebe is married to Mike. That just leaves me and Ross and Rach, you know what I mean?
Rach, there is a decent place to...
No, I'm performing the ceremony. I'm not wearing a tux.
So, you saw me on Days Of Our Lives huh? Want me to, want me to do a little Dr. Drake Remoray for ya?
Guys!?
Actually its not pies, its just pie.
Yeah!
What?
Yeah, are you just going down there to gawk at that hot girl with the belly button ring again?
I guess they weren't as good friends as we are.
How late are we?
Okay! Here we go. Pillow.
Sh-shh-shh!
I know.
aaw-ahhh-aaahhh STOP! STOP! I'm worried about damaging my head.
Oh.
My beers?! Look you guys, she's a very nice girl. Okay? We had a good time, but I just-I don't see it going anywhere.
Hey-hey, I'm not judging.
Iced tea.
But no, it's not close. You said it was in escrow? I couldn't even find it on the map.
Tell us!
Look, I can sense when women are depressed and vulnerable. It's one of my gifts.
Yes! Yeah, it's like they're always saying "let's go here, let's go there". Like we can afford to go here and there.
Thanks. Well but this one starts now.
Hey, what happened to your fancy chef's jacket?
Who's your friend? He's hot!
She's right in there.
Hey.
Oh, I got it! How about saying something like, "Monica...
Sure, May...tember.
Have you ever tried to sit through Citizen Kane?
They're ribbed for your pleasure.
CURIOUS GEORGE ! You know, the monkey, and the guy with the yellow hat!
You got it! And the rabbi's beard, 100% horsehair. Nice catch C.H.E.E.S.E.! It's your line C.H.E.E.S.E.! Wayne! Wayne!!
Joey!
Yeah. Why-Yeah, that would work for ya...
Gotcha.
Ahhh.
You okay man?
I still can't believe they took away my key. You trust me with yours.
Thank you.
Wow, talk about your bad luck, I mean, the first time you try panties and someone walks off with your clothes.
Hey Gunther, let me get a lemonade to go.
Sure, sure. Ok, "Bleu de la bleu, de la blu bla bleu" See?
Ross, did ask us first, and we set that night aside.
Well, I was hoping after tonight that maybe I could you know...
See, this is why I don't date women who read. Uh-oh.
Come on, season tickets! Season tickets, do you know what that means?
Oh, very funny. I don't know if you remember, but my audition was supposed to be Thursday. You got me the audition?! Let's hug it up!
Personal thing? What personal thing? I don't know.
Alright, so...so tell me one of your moves.
Yeah, it is! You wouldn't have lost the ring, right? Y'know what, Ross you were right from the start, he should be your best man.
Yeah, we haven't dropped it in...
Okay.
Hey, how do you spell suspicious?
Would you let it go Ross. It was just a dream. It doesn't mean...
No, he really said it.
pel.
Woah, woah, woah, you have a date?
Yeah, who is that?
That's 'help' spelled backwards so that the helicopters can read it from the air!
Hey!
You want my advice?
Take the bra off.
I can't. I keep seeing it the good way.
Ye-ye, we go to yours!
Hey!! I need to relax! Okay? I was working all day!
Why?
Yes!
Oh hey whoa-whoa, don't worry. Okay. When my sisters were pregnant they got every weird feeling in the book, it was always nothing.
Oh alright. Umm, well, okay, I usually start by having a bottle of wine sent to my table from a fan.
Sorry! Sorry.
Hey!!
So uh, hey, that uh, that wedding ring, huh? Man, that's nice!
Why would I return it? I love this bag!
Hey!
Oh that's amazing.
No! No, I'm the minister! All right, look-look, put 'em both on the phone, I'll marry them right now.
Monica and I were talking about who could kick whose ass in a fight, you or Ross?
Yeah!
Ooh, that's a great plan!
Hey, Felicity.
I don't know.
Well I didn't tell them!
Oh, thanks, thanks. Bye bye Jeannie.
Oh, don't worry, it's not a cat.
Couldn't have this conversation down at the truck huh?
Dah!!
From the land down under? I didn't know that either!
No. Here.
You talked to him. Are you crazy?
Shh. Shh. Don't try to talk, we'll get you up to your room, we'll soak your feet, you'll be okay.
Can you stop yellin'? You're makin' me nervous, and I can't go when I'm nervous.
Great! Thanks! You're gonna love her so much. And-Oh, she's the smartest of all the Tribbiani children. Hey, y'know the S.A.T's?
She looks so real! Y'know what I mean! She's this whole tiny little person. She already has eyelashes and knees and...uh-oh.
All right.
Yes, it's a highly controversial procedure.
Dude, Phoebe's mom has got a huge peni...
Kristen?
Unless you name your firstborn child Joey.
Phoebe! Don't put ideas in his head!
Damnit Phoebe!!
Hey, it's gonna be all right.
Whoa!
Art.
Well what's complicated? You spin the Wheel of Mayhem to go up the Ladder of Chance. You go past the Mud Hut through the Rainbow Ring to get to the Golden Monkey; you yank his tail and boom! You're in Paradise Pond!
Oh-oh-oh-oh, how I do it is, I look a woman up and down and say, "Hey, how you doin'?"
Ah, well, if I want the girl to kiss me, first thing I do is make my lips look irresistible.
What? Are you referring to my man's bag? At first, I thought it just looked good, but it's practical too. Check it out! It's got compartments for all your stuff! Your wallet! Your keys! Your address book!
Ah yeah-wait a second now! Look we're gonna have to set a spending limit on the date. I don't have the money to take her to a fancy place like that.
Or equally weak.
Yeeeeaaaahhh! What's messing you up? The wine? The candles? The moonlight? You've just got to go up to her and say, 'Rachel, I think that...'
Y'know what? Bring her both, and I'll have the same.
Nice!
Well, I was due.
Nice.
I'm sorry, it just-I don't know it doesn't really look like it can do anything.
All right, all we need is a little lighter fluid.
No, I don't think so, see Ross, because I think you love her.
Well, have-have you told him how you feel?
Hey! I got great news!
Uhm... oh! Okay. You come with me, and you tell them that the house is haunted!
Hey! How's it going?
Y-y-yeah! Yeah you do.
Fine! Now, where'd we land on those pancakes?
You're a dancer? She-she's a dancer!
Chandler, come on, you're gonna find somebody.
I've been trying for two days. When I called the restaurant, they said she was too busy to talk. I can't believe she's blowin' me off.
I don't know. Maybe pizza?
Okay wait-wait p-please be cool! Okay? I work with this woman.
Where do you think, Zelda?
Seriously guys, the trash talk is embarrassing.
Waiting for candy.
Yeah that didn't sound like me.
Oh my God. So that's it?! I only get to bring one guest?
Yeah! And hey, thanks for coming with me. And thanks again for helping me take a shower.
Yes.
"Oh, Chandler, now, now, that's it. There, faster!"
Hey! I'm in, they're gonna let me audition!
I'm fine with it, I mean, if you're OK watching a video filled with two nippled people.
Pheebs! You're blocking the porn! Look out!
I just had a glass.
Hey!
Oh no-no Rach, please, don't be sorry. Okay? Don't be sorry. Y'know I was only kidding you.
That's it! I'm tired of covering for you two! This has got to stop! Ahh! And tighty-whiteys! What are you, 8?
Oh well, it's not on TV yet.
Yeah, they do! Quit being a baby and leave me alone! There, you've just had your first class!
Oh, forget about it. She rocks!
I don't like this anymore.
What are you talking about alone? What about Ross?
Yeah! Yeah! That would be very helpful! Yeah.
Oh my God, is she going back to him?
Yeah!
Man, I got this close to him and Monica kneed me in the back. What's going on?
I wish I could but I just found out that I have to be at work really early the next day, so I can't go, but, you know, take the extra ticket and invite whoever you want.
Guess I don't know. My experience: if a girl says yes to being taped... She doesn't say no to much else, I tell ya...
Your folks are really that bad, huh?
Okay!
She took 'em!
Yeah, yeah, in honor of their 35th wedding anniversary, I had a star named after them.
Your other student, was you!
Then she came back with "The question is, when are you gonna grow up and realise I have a bomb?"
Dude you said, "No!"
Uh, she's with me. Dr. Drake Remoray.
That's-ah what I suspected-ah.
Yeah, you're great! Okay, let's take it from...
No way! It's mine!!
What?!
Okay, what have we always wanted to do together?
Oh, it's okay. You don't have to be so mean about it.
Boyfriend?
Pheebs, I still need some help here.
Poor thing. Cut down in her prime.
Fine, fine okay. But I gotta say technically, I didn't even do anything wrong.
Oh hi!
Oh, no, that's okay, I don't need your help. I worked on it myself and I gotta say, I am pretty good!
I will be doing a dramatic reading of one of Emma's books.
So ah, Phoebe tells us you write jingles.
Great! Hey! All right! Well-well what is it?!
Oh, women can. You can't.
I said I think you're hot and now I'm embarrassed.
And you're Okay with that?
Oh. Well, the way I see it, the guy's upset here, y'know? I mean, his wife's dead, his brother's missing... I think his butt would be angry here.
Yeah. Okay. Ross's treat! Where do you wanna eat?
Hey babies! Oh, I'm having the best morning. That uh, that Porsche I've got the keys too, still there!
Ohh.
Well then maybe I will.
Yeah! And you have so many more choices than you do with men's underwear!
Hey-hey, Pheebs, check it out, we already learned a song. Ready? One, two, three, four...
What-what are you guys doing here? I thought I told you not to come.
Stop staring at me!
Alright, well next time you take a shower, think about the last thing I wash and the first thing you wash.
I don't think so.
Are you serious?!
Yeah, there's this superintendent's dance, the Super Ball. I don't know, and he wants to impress Marge, this lady super that he's a crush on.
Hey, can I ask you something? In this, in this picture of you and your wife, is your wife Rachel?
Yeah, you fogged Danny.
Hey, do we do this too much?
Fine!
Strike two!
Oh my God! You're pregnant!
I'm a man.
Well, I'm telling everyone about you! That's the only way to explain the underwear and the video camera that doesn't make me look like a pig!
I just have one question!
Alright, have a good time.
Oh, he was this cab driver we had in London.
Yeah. We figured when we couldn't find you, you'd gone home to make up with Rachel. Which is probably what you shoulda done. Huh?
Yesterday's pages did not reflect my best work.
Fifth day's a charm.
Argh-argh!! Ooh, soft. Is this mink?
He paid a lot of money for it.
Hey-hey-hey!
Man, I didn't think we were gonna make it!
Yeah! In fact, to prove how much you mean to me, here.
Stegosaurus!
Nooooo! Being funny is your thing!
Why?
Out.
All right, turn around, I got to get a look at this thing.
Hey.
This is like the temporary robot, right?
Ten. Okay. Now Tag there's such a thing as to many women.
Hey!
Damn!
No-no-no-no-no, it's-it's uh, you just uh, uh reminded me that uh, I need to do my stretches too.
I had to get out of the apartment. Janine is like stretching all over the place. Y'know, everywhere I look she's like...
Bye.
Okay. Yeah. Yeah, I'll grab this one.
Okay, all right.
You don't wanna see what I just saw!
All right.
No! No! No! No, I'm not going to punch Chandler.
Huh. But still Ross, you're worst day with two women, pretty much better than any other day! Y'know what I mean?
That, is not a cat! {I have to agree with Joey on this one.}
Right!
Ahh, wait, is Wendy the runner-up Miss Oklahoma?
Yeah, I got too excited!
Boy, it was so hard not to laugh, I tell ya. Hey, hey, the place looks great!
je.
You don't know!
Weekend at Bernie's.
Hey, so how'd it go with Julie? Did you, did you break her heart?
Oh, here I am, here's my big scene!
All right, Rach, the big question is, does he like you? All right? Because if he doesn't like you, this is all a moo-point.
Oh, I do. How you doin?
Yeah, I... I don't want Stevie to see her like this.
I dont know. I like her, you know. Shes different. Theres uh, somethin about her.
Pheebs, run!
Okay. All right. Umm, so uh, so how did it happen? Did your eyes meet across the room? And then the next thing y'know you're in the bathtub together and she's feeding you strawberries?
That's right!
Yeah, okay.
Hey, Monica, wow you've been in the bathroom for like a half-hour.
Told ya.
Well, okay. You were my girlfriend and we were doing the crossword puzzle. Y'know like you guys were doing last night. So, that's it. I'm in love with Monica and I'll be moving out.
Eyes! No, no. Your eyes! No. Chandler's eyes!
What?
No! I want an award I did win! But nobody's giving me any of those! Plus-Hey Rach, if-if I put it up there right? When people come over they'll see it and they'll think I won it.
Umm, hi.
Okay, this is gonna be tough. Hold your breath.
How does it feel knowing you're never gonna be with another woman again huh? Knowing you're gonna have to wake up to the same face everyday until you finally have the sweet release of death.
no. No, I, I couldn't do that.
They loved me!
Yes! I will have the lobster ravioli.
Yeah! Me too.
Whoa, I didn't know we could date your sister!
Hey.
Yeah, I didn't throw any of that out..
It's two gifts in one. It's a pen that's also a clock! Huh?
What about me?! You-you just said I could!
Wait-wait-wait-wait! Come on! Come on, let's trade! The timing's perfect, I just clogged the toilet!
Ross-Ross-Ross-Ross! Stay away from that guy , and that guy . And that one-Dude! They're all huge!
Yeah I did!
All right! All right! Enough! Enough! Enough!! Enough! You two go home! I-I-I gotta talk to Janine!
I'm outta here. Here's my credit card. Dinner's on me. I'm sorry, Chandler.
What?! I don't have 20,000!
You're not stupid. You're meaner than I thought.
I need to say goodbye to the table first.
Look at this clown! Just because he's got a bigger boat he thinks he can take up the whole river. Get out of the way jackass! Who names their boat Coast Guard anyway?
Oh, what did I say?
Yeah.
Well, this guy came by to look at the unit and-and he said he didn't think big enough to fit a grown man!
No. wait a minute what was the little mermaid?
What?
Dude, are you okay?
Whoo-weh hey weh-hey whoo hey!!
No! No, you smell like a meadow. I'm sorry.
How you doin'?
I can't believe I'm hearing this!
Hey I liked her, alright. Maybe, maybe too much. I don't know I guess I just got scared.
Hey, Ross, Bodington's!
Ten years I've been waiting for a break like this Chandler, ten years! I mean, Days of Our Lives. That's actually on television.
And-and you won't blame us for any damage?
Sure I do. Coule?
It isn't working.
Ahh, the babies miss me?
I can hear you!
Pheebs, you can't do that. The casting director doesn't talk to friends, she only talks to agents.
I'd love to! Yeah!
Mar-klan.
Uh, excuse me. Jerry is the director, which one's he?
I can fix it. Hold on. Look out. Look out.
Well, when Jake did it I saw that...he was wearing women's underwear!
Oh, that smells good!
Huh.
So...What?
Definitely!
Oh well, that changes everything! Y'know what Pheebs?
Who's Elaine?
Yes I did! I'm Chandler. Dude, what happened?
MIKE!!!
Hi.
Yeah!!
How is this your seat?
Well, maybe that's because you're closer to you. So you look bigger to you from where you are.
Hey!
Okay, how long was I watching that woman?
Chandler gave me word of the day toilet paper. I'm gonna get some coffee.
No-no-no-no-no-no, not her, not her. My youngest sister, Dina, she's really interested in fashion, and she wants to talk to someone successful, y'know, to give her some advice.
Okay!
Well, I'm sorry if I'm not a middle-aged black woman! And I'm also sorry if sometimes I go to the wrong audition! Okay, look, if I have to pretend I don't know about you two, then you two are gonna have to pretend there's nothing to know about.
Marcel, I'm hungry.
I know.
Hey, this isn't about juice anymore, alright man.
Where are you going? The vicar won't be home for hours.
No you won't. Look he knows he did a terrible thing and I believe him, he's sorry. But, you've got one more apology to make, all right, you've got to apologize to Mary-Angela.
The balloon?
Okay. See?! I told ya!
No, I'm not sleeping with your friend Jane again.
I mean, the giant is like five years younger than me, y'know, you think I'll ever get there?
Okay. Uhh, tortilla chips, yogurt.
It certainly is a miracle.
Oh now-Hey Ross-Ross! Do you wanna-wanna come in for a beer or something?
Ugh!!
Yeah, try sticking it in the freezer for 20 minutes. I'm tellin' ya!
I'm gonna say someone I'm gonna have sex with. Hey!
Uh, well he did not get sick somewhere in there and it was immediately found and properly cleaned up!
She did?
Alright, just one. Wow, you're good at that.
Hey, what if I said, I could even things out for ya, meatwise.
Dude, you see right thru me!!
I feel so stupid, you know? Why... why do I keep going after the wrong girls?
Hi.
I don't believe this... Have you guys been...
Are you sure?
Uhhh, I don't think you're gonna like this.
Is this movie gonna be my big break?
It's really gone?
Yeah, she is. Wow! How you doin'?
Great, I'm finished! In fact, I just dropped it off at the agency.
Well sure, you name a kid that, what do you expect them to grow up to be?
Yeah, I gotta go! I got an acting job. Like you'd believe that. This sucks!
Did I get it?
Like what?
Pheebs! There you are! Okay, you broke my fridge; you owe me 400 bucks!
Not a dad.
Oh yeah, that's right!
Hey, I've done plays before. I'm a serious actor.
Bedroom is clear, although you might need some new pillows.
Well knock it off, you're supposed to be my friend.
C'mon, you guys, it wasn't that bad. It was better than that thing I did with the trolls, at least you got to see my head.
Phoebe. Whaddyou think a good stage name for me would be?
Hey Rach, so can I sing happy birthday to you now?
Nope.
Hi.
Look, there's nothing I can do for him right now, he's still in his sweat pants, that's still Phase One. Y'know? I'll be back for Phase Two, I would never miss Phase Two.
How do we say yes now and make it seem like we're not doin' it just to ride in the cool car?
I don't see the baby. Where is it?
Don't worry! Don't worry. I just told him, very nicely, "You don't go buying people's babies, so back off!!"
Well why don't you just reach out and take his trampoline.
Hey Ross, this is one of my co-stars, Dirk. Dirk, this is my good friend Ross.
If it's not you, this is a horrible story.
Joe Stalin. Y'know, that's pretty good.
Look at me! I'm Chandler! Could I be wearing any more clothes? Maybe if I wasn't going commando...
Yeah, there's just one thing that might be kind've a problem. See, I, uh, had to kiss this guy.
No way! 'Kay look, if I have to go to the doctor for anything it's gonna be for this thing sticking out of my stomach! Why did I have to start working out again? Damn you 15s!
What?
Well you're whippin' so slow! Can't you do it any faster?
He's breathing!
No.
Are you kidding? Phoebe, I would be honored.
Dude, I really don't think you should be wearing that.
She told us.
The same way you lost. I started out with a King and a Queen, bamn! Ross gets a 2 and a 3. Then I get a Jack and a King, boom! Ross gets a 4 and a 5! Ross was getting the Cup card, the D-Cup, the Sittin' Down Bonus! Meanwhile, I didn't even get half a cup! Nothin'!!
Shhh! Man, you made me lose it!
The airport?
She has a lot of crap!
Hey!
I know, but don't you think the sick thing is way better than the play thing?
So what? I drove down, sold T-shirts, had a blast. And y'know who knows how to party? Drunk college chicks.
And it is a love that is based on having and giving and receiv-
Yeah!
Okay, listen, hey, Ross. Why don't you try to relax, okay? Maybe have a drink.
On...?
You went through my personal property?
Hey Phoebe.
Sorry Phoebe.
Oh, yoii. What was that for?
Oh, that's what she meant! You know, if they're gonna shorten it, they should call it the MUSE! You know, short for museum, and avoid all the confusion!
Well I'd be scared of them, but all right.
Multi-colored robes! Ooh, and maybe a hat.
Okay!
Awww, one of my students got an audition. I'm so proud.
What?
I don't want to move again!
Uh, hi. We uh, we used to work together.
Chandler, Heckles was a nut case.
Sure. "Monica."
Consider it done.
Say what?
Oh good, uh you're here. Uh Pheebs? Listen uh sit down. I-I got something I want to say.
Man! When you said it was a problem about your boss and the baby I figured it was something about maternity leave.
Hey, Ross, want some cider?
Sir.
Had the beef-tips, huh?
Uhhhh.... I'll just pee in the street.
Can I offer you a drink?
Hey.
Yeah, where were you!
Mma, Mma, Mmaah
Nope.
Okay. Now this is just for tonight. Starting tomorrow, you gotta make a change. This has gone on long enough.
Yeah.
Okay! All right. Umm, all right Wayne, level with me. Okay? I-I keep hearing all these rumors that I might get fired. Okay, they even have actors coming in to read for my part! Come on man, you-you got to give me a second chance! I mean, I love-I love this little guy! Ah-ah!! Okay, that's why you didn't want me to touch him right? Here you go! Okay? Stupid! I can't believe it! God! Hey, how you doin'?
Ross! They're gonna kill you!
Uhh, this is it, this is how we're gonna die. Ready?
Where've you been?
Actually, technically, I didn't.
What's the matter, Pheebs?
Yeah. Hey, I hope Ross didn't think that we just went in there because we were uncomfortable being out here!
"I am what you made me. You know what? I could go right now."
Yes, and they should name one of their kids Joey. I may not have kids; someone's gotta carry on the family name.
I didn't know that! Well, what a pretty last name!
Wow thanks!
See ya. Well, this is just us.
Yeah, you'd think I'd give up being a minister and start paying to ride the subway? Huhuh...
What? That's the kinda thing you usually run by me.
I'm just so nervous! Y'know? The callback isn't until tomorrow at five. I feel like my head is going to explode!
Wow.
You know you've been spitting on me?!
Nothing. It's just old and dingy, that's all.
Ew! What is that? Something exploded!
Well don't just say.
I guess.
It worked! I scared ya, I knew it! Ha-ha!
Wow. Hey look, if it helps, I don't want to feel this way. Honest. I just keep thinking, "Ah, I'll get over this." Y'know? I just-It just keeps gettin' harder. I don't, I don't know what to do. Y'know? What do I do?
Uh well yeah, that was the plan, but by the time I got to it there was only a couple of pieces left!
Shh, OK, here I come, here I come. See I'm comin' to fix the copier, I can't get to the copier, I'm thinkin' what do I do, what do I do. . . so I just watch 'em have sex. And then I say, wait, here's my line, you know that's bad fo r the paper tray.
No, no, it's okay, I already told the waiter what they want.
Argh!
Thanks for telling me!
Well I tell ya, I should probably buy a place in the city first. And I just got what you meant again-That is-I tell ya, that is a tricky one!
Is everything okay?
Hi, Rach.
YES!!
Why wouldn't ya? Erin is great! Then-then there's you guys.
Take it back?
You gotta tell Ross how you feel.
What's in it?
Yeah me too, all night.
Now that you're a couple, we don't get two presents from you guys?
Hey!
Yeah! Ask them if they brought their friends any souvenirs!
Are we talking about one of those big boats that carry cars that go like five miles an hour?
Yeah, or-or to get a hooker.
Yes, now is when you swoop! You gotta make sure that when Paolo walks out of there, the first guy Rachel sees is you, She's gotta know that you're everything he's not! You're like, like the anti-Paolo!
Well I'm wanna hear it, because she keeps doing this.
I'm sorry! It was a reflex!
Face to face, yeah!
All right!
Hey, cut him some slack. It was Chandler's idea.
Rachel, would you stop saying that?! Hey-hey look, remember on the show when-when Caprice was dying and she gave me...
JOEY DOESN'T SHARE FOOD! end.
Is that your card?
And a couple of these little tiny boxes.
Listen, buddy, we're just looking out for you.
'Sup? 'Sup dude?
All right, I'm sorry. Rach I-Rach I'm sorry. Okay? I'm sorry! Maybe I can make up for it by, taking you roughly in the barn.
No, I sat in the paint.
Check this out? Huh? Yeah. That's the stuff. What do you think?
But it happens? I'm gotta go to the bathroom.
Hey, kids...
He doesn't do much, does he?
Ooh, great! Thanks!
But it is a big deal!! I have to tell someone!
Phoebs, what's goin' on?
Yeah, but it did happen, so...
Wow Dennis Phillips! That's great! How did you guys meet?
listen to this... I went out with this girl last night and half way through our date I realized I already slept with her.
Three down, Days Of Our Lives star blank Tribbiani. That's me!! I'm blank!!
Ross!
really, great, did I actually ask you?
Nothing.
No! Year! Happy No Year!
Hey, let's go look at it!
Hey, so listen, I went across the street and talked to the doorman- I got the peeper's name! Can I use the phone?
Hey.
Hey.
Well, it doesn't matter what I would do.
Come on man there's gotta be something that gets you choked up! Like uh, uh oh, what if you saw a three-legged puppy?
Hey, Pheebs?
How come you have two?
Get out! I couldn't stop if a meteor hit me.
Oh, Urse...
Look Ross, I am so-so sorry. I-I-I...
I mean, she should be with someone like... Ross! You know what I mean, he uses all those big words too! Man, smart people are dull!
Really. And what do you mean you never have fun anymore? You have fun with me, remember that time we saw those strippers and you paid me 50 bucks to eat that book?
"I thought I knew who the enemy was, but it was you all along."
What? What's going on?
That you're actually 50?
Listen uh, I'm really sorry, it looks like I'm gonna be stuck here for a while. I got the transmission fluid, but when I went to put it in the car, the transmission wasn't there!
Please, we're trying to have a conversation.
Okay! All right, I'll see ya. We got it! We got it!
Ooh. I-I don't know Chan. I'm not so good with remembering lines.
No, no, no, I'm telling ya. Imagine yourself living in a supermarket and you will understand okay? So the question is, what do we do?
What do you have against the duck?! He doesn't make any noise!
All right, well first of all I would like to say that you both performed very well. Okay? You should be proud of yourselves. And-and I would also like to say that in this competition there are no losers. Well, except for Rachel-Damnit!
You guys got anything to eat? I just went down to Johnos for some chicken and it was closed!
Hey! I am secure with my masculinity.
No, never done that either.
Uh, listen I gotta double check for tickets tonight. Who-who got what?
Okay now, before I make my final decision I uh, I just want to make sure our personalities match. Okay, so I made up a little test. Now, I'm gonna say a word and then you say the first thing that comes to mind.
Come on C.H.E.E.S.E., I'm not leaving without you! Try routing your backup source through your primary CPU.
Erectus?
Umm, now uh... It's a scary world out there, especially for a single mom. Y'know, now I always thought you and I had a special bond so... Phoebe Buffay, will you marry me?
All right!
Oh there is! If you want something enough and your heart is pure, wondrous things can happen!
Dude! I am trying to sleep!
Ha!
I don't know Ross, not if you're gonna talk about how you gave up a career in basketball to become a paleontologist.
That's right I stepped up! She's my friend and she needed help! And if I had too, I'd pee on anyone of you!
In what John Houston film would you hear this line, "Badges? We don't need no stinkin' badges!"
Well I can promise you, at least one person will be crying. I'm an actor, and any actor worth himself can cry on cue.
Okay.
Yep. Hey, what do you say we make it a double feature?
Yeah. Ross and Rachels Apartment.
Right, I guess. Alright, so see you at four.
She sure does. Why does she have a pink bow taped to her head?
London baby!!
Oh, we're supposed to just get him a ticket?! That guy is always mooching off of us!
So what are you doing bringing her here?! There's people here!
Yeah uh look Rach, there's something I gotta tell ya.
I like it.
Hey all right, Ross came as doody.
Quick volleyball question.
Ahhh...... Eh?
Excellent.
Ohh, then no. Maybe I should hear those specials again.
You got it! Oh-oh!
Seriously, you like it? This guy was sellin' them on 8th avenue and I looked at 'em and I though, you know what I don't have?
How about zero down and zero a month for a long, long time?
Sorry!
Look it's not that bad. So what, it blocks a little of your door, a little of my door.
Back when you and Rachel were together, if Chandler had kissed her, would you hear him out?
Because it's all tainted with your betrayal. From now on this apartment is empty for me! And I'm not happy about you either. Oh, and just so you know, I made that bread for you.
Ahhh, I fold like a cheap hooker who got hit in the stomach by a fat guy with sores on his face. Oh, I'm out.
Chandler?
Well uh, I had breakfast here so technically I saved $3.50.
Oh I am!
Get back in there!
Yeah, turns out our kids go to the same school. Small world huh?
Interesting.
The question should be Rach, what is not so great about the shining. Okay? And the answer would be nothing. All right? This is like the scariest book ever. I bet it's way better than that classic of yours.
Salami, anchovies, jam!
And?
And again, and again, and again... Hello? And again.
Yeah?
Thank you.
I have to pee. And Rachel's in the bathroom!
Hey! I did not cry my eyes out!! Come on! It's like the end of an era! No more J-man and Channie's!!
Hey!
Hey, I'll be alright. I mean it's not like I'm starting from sqare one. I was Dr. Drake Remoray on Days of Our Lives. Heh? I mean that's gotta have some kind of cache.
You don't keep it over here on this table any more?
You cooked him?
Yeah-yeah, absolutely.
Yes!! Ha-ha!! All right! Hey! How cool would it be if you could watch like a real life-sized version of this? Huh? I mean how crazy would that be?
Thank you! Alright, let me see how I'm gonna start... "Dear baby adoption decider people..."
No! No! I-I can do it one more time! See? Look! Hmm, noodle soup. Damnit!
No-no hey buddy, please let me dance with that girl, I really like her and I think I have a shot.
Yes we do! Now look, that was the best nap I ever had!!
Is that why you bought all this stuff?! Well, y'know what I will not watch your TV, I will not listen to your stereo, and there's a cinnamon raisin loaf in the new bread maker that I'm not gonna eat! You know why?!
What?!
You got it!
Me?! Oh come on, man! You can't do this! Come on! I'm your hand twin!!
Yeah, I'm an actor.
Not knowing when to shut up...
Oh yeah, I added three.
Things that burn.
Rach, it's, it's ah, it's not that we don't want to, really. Are we talking models in their underwear?
This is crazy! Hey look, I wanna switch to Rachel!
Hey.
Hey! You guys! Remember that audition I had a while ago and didn't get the part?
Noooo, that's what I was wearing when I donated. I'm kinda surprised there's any of my boys left.
No. No, I just uh, I just loved the way it feels when everybody thinks I own a Porsche.
Yeah... I think we do... ... about what?
Alright!
Uh huh.. uh huh... oh my God! Okay! Okay, I'll be there! That was my agent. My agent has just gotten me a job...in the new Al Pacino movie!
I got a gig!
That's right! 'Cause I'm a Tribbiani! And this is what we do! I mean we may not be great thinkers or world leaders, we don't read a lot or run very fast, but damnit! We can eat!
But you haven't even heard the chorus!
But the drawer full of take-out menus is okay, right?
Who was that?
Yep. Ice Capades.
Mike, do you take this woman to be your wife?
You, you want me to help you with that?
Ooh, Ross, look! Look!
I'm sorry Pheebs, I just, y'know, I just wanted to do a good deed. Like-like you did with the babies.
Yeah. What-what did Tag say?
Yes! Yes! Unreasonable!
Oh, Richard's here. I should run down say bye to him
'My scones.'
No, I'm on right after this guy shoots himself.
And that's every month?
Or! You can just, y'know...
Ohhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!
Soooooo... you are now looking at Dr. Drake Ramore, neurosurgeon, recurring in at least four episodes!
That's kinda nice.
Damnit!
Oh hey, don't worry about it man. Don't worry about it, no big deal.
But the audition's in a couple hours and I don't even understand the game.
Hey, the fight's starting!
Does it really matter?
Hey Chandler, while you were sleeping that guy from your old job called again.
Well, he's too shy, he doesn't thing he's good enough to dance with girls yet.
Yeah, and I met this really hot single mom at the store. What's an elf to do?
Don't you think I asked him that before he got in?!
Ok, I may not have treated your friends well in the past, but I have grown up a lot, really. Honest, Rach?
Right! And when is that due?
Ok, Rach!
Yeah! Look!
You mean how they're friends and nothing more?
Yeah, yeah. Hey, they totally match! They look great! They look great! How you doing!
Uhh, Ms. Phalange, may I ask you a question as an impartial person at-at this table?
Shh, OK, here I come, here I come. See I'm comin' to fix the copier, I can't get to the copier, I'm thinkin' what do I do, what do I do...so I just watch 'em have sex. And then I say, wait, here's my line, you know that's bad for the paper tray.
So what are we gonna do?! We have no reinforcements! No-no food!
Nice shoes, huh?
All right, fine... But if I enjoy this, you have only yourself to blame...
I hate this woman!! I hate her! She told everyone in the company about that info-mercial, and now they all keep asking me to open their drinks. Okay, and whenever I can't do it, they're all like-like laughing at me.
Yeah, Rach, I think you're handling that really well.
Aww man! I can't believe I locked myself out again!
Have you heard about a little something called, Not Making Girls Cry.
Whom. That's right.
Y'know what you guys? I'm uh, I'm gonna go too. And uh, I'm sorry about everything.
I said I didn't technically.
Which is why I waited until now to introduce you to Mike.
Wow! Well, my folks really liked it! So what-what did you guys think? It wasn't that good.
Ohh-oh, wasn't he cheating on you with her?
Unless you wanna practice the Foxtrot again? Or-or the Tango?
London baby!
You didn't watch the tape.
I'm telling ya... I can do it.
Hey Mon! Want some pancakes?
Thanks. Yeah, I figure if I wear these in my scenes at least I won't get spit in the eyes, y'know?
Oh God! That's Rachel!
Get outta here. This is our stop too.
Yeah! If you wanna sing at their wedding, well you sing at their wedding!
This right here is where I keep the pizza. And uh that's where the napkin is.
My chair heels itself.
Joseph's good, isn't he?
Dude, two times that happened!
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. You just want to put it on your hand!
All right, let's go Pheebs.
OK, listen I've been on sets before, so let me give you a little advice, alright? It's a show, but we're just dancing, OK? It's no big deal. The important thing to remember &#150; stay cool.
Uh, wow, 700.
Hey, great! All right!
Maybe you can tell me. My agent would like to know why I didn't show up at the audition I didn't know I had today. The first good thing she gets me in weeks. How could you not give me the message?!
I never laughed so hard-Did you see the wine come out of my nose?
Wow, this is wild. What're you gonna get?
Here you go. Let me ask you a question.
Hey, uh, why don't you read it to her?
So, you know I'm filling in for Phoebe's step dad, tomorrow, right?
I know.
Wow! Look at this! He wrote a check for 50,000 dollars to Hugo Ligrens Ring Design. Oh, sorry, what do you think the good news is?
Nice!! Yeah! Is that part of your resolution, your new thing for today?
You pushed him!
Oh! That's nice.
No, seriously.
Hey, Mr. Bing. That uh, hotel you stayed at called. Said someone left an eyelash curler in your room.
Forget about it.
What?
It's not a cat!
So you like the nachos uh? Myself I'm partial to...
All right, All right, let's just get this out in the open okay? You're hot. I'm lovable. Clearly there's a vibe going on between us. But, we're roommates and it's a huge mistake for us to continue down this road.
Oh yeah! For every dollar Shutter Speed makes, one penny of it goes right in Joey's pocket.
Oh, I embarrass you?
Damn! I am good at Cups!
Well I guess I should've thought about my wife and kids before I talked back to chef Geller!
We'll do it all, and better! Look, after tonight, Gandolf will want to party with us, dude! Come on!
Althea!
Yeah-hah. Toute-de-le-fruit.
Hey-hey, you're startin' to sound like the butcher's wife there in-in chapter seven.
Oh... uh... look... before you...
All right, uh... Oh hey, you've done this before Ross, well what did you say when you made up your vows?
"You knew this all along and you never told me? You never told me? I can never forgive you, I can never forgive myself, I have nothing to live for Bang End Scene!"
Hey!
Will you quit hoggin' it!
GET THAT LEGLESS WITCH OUT OF HERE!
We've got a box.
Ross?
He cut off his ear.
You kissed.
Oh no-no-no!
Hey-hey-hey, I think we might find out the answer to our question.
I know! That's why we got to find Monica!! You know where she is?
Yeah! And also, a little like a French guy. I never noticed that before.
Well maybe we just take that one away.
You're driving me crazy with that!
A place to entertain my lady friends.
That's better, now just bend your arms a little more. There you go. Okay, look straight ahead. Now this time I want you to really put your ass into it.
What?
Didn't think so.
You're fine, ok? But everyone else acts like an idiot around famous people!
Is she great or what?
Ok.
That's the title! Yeah! Y'know they really lucked out that the initials spell cheese.
A little bit more.
Okay.
There are?
I'm not Drake.
Yeah, we set up a court in your room. Uh, you didn't really like that grey lamp, did you?
Huh. Interesting. Now there are obstacles. Hot nanny and me against the world. This is the kind of stuff great novels are made of.
You're a lucky man. You know what I miss the most about her? That cute nibbly noise when she eats. Like a happy little squirrel, or a weasel.
Ooh-ooh, Pheebs, you want a strong name? How about, The Hulk?
Oh, I like that. Yeah.
Lookin' good Mr. Cotter.
And, and just so you know, if you wanted to expand this scene like, like have the cab crash or somethin', I could attend to the victims 'cause I have a background in medical acting.
Yeah, okay.
I don't know. You uh, you got something for me?
So, did you uh, find anyone to marry you guys yet?
Well that thing is clearing in the way! All right. Ah-ha! Ah-ah!! Damn fridge!
Well, I think we've all learned something about who's disgusting and who's not. Eh? All right, now, I'm going to get back to my bucket. I'm only eating the skin, so the chicken's up for grabs.
Will you wear a thong?
Joey's your best friEnd. You want to make him a cheese sandwich everyday. And you also want to buy him hundreds of dollars worth of pants.
Yeah.
I don't know! It's not like it's porn! This is a serious, legitimate movie. Y'know? And the nudity is really important to the story.
Yeah! We are!
Hi. Hi, sorry I'm late.
OK.
Who?
That's it? You're-you're gonna let me do this?! This-this is my career we're talking about here!
Yeah, and she's really nice too. She taught me all about how to work the cameras, and smell-the-fart acting.
Oh, man. What're the odds of that happening?
Oh my God!!
Fine, fine, so, why don't the four of us go out and have dinner together tonight? You know, as friends?
Yeah, I was bummed too.
That's not what she said last night.
We were supposed to bring presents?
Ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah! Enh? All right, what do you think?
No, I'm alright man. Really.
All right well, I'm outta here. Wish me luck.
I don't get it. I mean, I was so sure this was what I wanted.
Y'know, breadstick fangs are always funny.
Look, it's one thing not to cast me, but to lie to me?
I call Godfather!
Joey Tribbiani.
And he never played before either! Y'know what I think? I think beginner's luck, very important in Cups.
Hey Mon, you might wanna make some more lasagna too, because something might've happened to a huge chunk of it.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, no!
Ah, it's career stuff. I don't know if you heard but they killed off my character on the show.
Oh, want a good name, go with Joey. Joey's your pal. Joey's your buddy. "Where is everybody?" "Well, they're hanging out with Joey."
No more jam?!
What?
All right, that's it! He cannot do this to Phoebe. This guy is going to get the butt kicking of a lifetime! But, is he a big guy?
Well how about this one? Testing the effects of Joey Tribbiani on attractive nurse receptionists.
Just get in there and make a face to face apology, you know? Look them in the eye. I know I can get them to forgive us.
What?
Wow, it is easy. Now, I can have milk everyday.
And now Chandler! We're all gettin' so old! Why are you doing this to us?!
Okay. Okay, so I'm writing you a check for...So you fell asleep during my movie. Big deal right? How do you clear this thing?
Great, you can cover Chandler.
Uh, why, it's a... one of her favorites, uh, "Riding the Storm Out. Coping with post-partum depression" eesh! "Love you forever". Love you forever. By Robert Munsch. Published by Firefly books. Printed in Mexico. A mother held her new baby and very slowly rocked him back and forth, back and forth, back and forth, and while she held him she sang "I'll love you forever, I'll like you for always, as long as I'm living, my baby you'll be". . And while he rocked her, he sang "I'll love you forever, I'll like you for always, as long as I'm living, my baby you'll be".
Yeah, we'll be fine.
There you go! Keep going. Keep going!
Leetch spots Messier in the crease- there's the pass!
So he likes to break stuff.
Oh man!
Well, so, stay for the museums!
Look, I understand if you came by to hit me, I deserve it.
Why should I help you?!
It's not what you said. It's the way you said it... Oh My God, I'm a woman!!!
No, I don't think it's just about just getting a girlfriend. Y'know? I mean, yeah, I can get a girlfriend! Yeah, we could sit in the chair and do crosswords, but y'know are we ever going to have y'know the closeness like-like you guys have?
No no, seriously, Chandler and I were just talkin about this. He is so much cooler than our dads. I mean, you know, our dad's are ok, ya know, but Richard is just- ow, ow. What are you kickin me for? Huh? I'm tryin to talk here.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! So, I walk in the door and make the right.
Ooh... Not so good.
Chandler, look they're actors. They're there to do a job, just 'cause they work together, doesn't mean they're gonna get together. I mean just 'cause it happened with Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins, it doesn't mean it's gonna happen with them.
All right, my New Year's resolution is to learn how to play the guitar.
So you're gonna have to do it in the mess!
Hey!
That's ridiculous!
Whoa! Whoa! Guys! Please! Come on! Come on! This is obviously just a big misunderstanding.
Well, I guess you're right. Maybe, maybe I'll take her down to the incinerator. It's gonna be so said, and kinda cool. She's heeled!
Well that, that sounds good.
Oh you know uh Kash, really liked you the other day. He said he thought you were charming.
That's okay Ross maybe you need a new picture. Okay? It's not gonna be what you thought, but no matter what there's gonna be a brand new little baby, your baby. Who cares what the picture looks like?
Sorry. Wrong boobies.
Okay. And uh, are you married.
Man, I've got food all over me.
Oh!
Hey!
The thing is...'cause I live with Rachel I'm here for a lot of the stuff, okay? And Ross...Ross is missing everything. So...
You have Knicks tickets?
Really? 'Cause I could kinda use the money.
Nope.
Fan out! Fan out!
Come on here, have a seat.
Goo, goo, goo, waaah!
Not following you.
Alright, you want the truth? I'm thinkin' about it.
Look, I don't wanna hear this right now.
Thirty seconds left on the timer!
I'm on it!
Oh wow, what a beautiful name! What is it again?
Hey, it's not like it sounds.
So, did you bring a little something for Ross?
Oh! Sure! How much? Two thousand dollars?
Hey! So?
Oh okay, how about this one. I was gonna wait until the end of the night to kiss you, but you're so beautiful...I don't think I can.
Hey guys! I was at the library all morning and I already finished my five pages for today!
Hey! No-no-no-no, you can't take him away from me! I got a great partner to pick up girls with! Finally!!
No, Pheebs, listen, if you decide to do this, we'll be supportive like crazy.
All right, I should get going, big day a work. Y'know I'm in a coma? Today, they do this test on me and it turns out I'm not brain dead.
Uhh, cause, uhh, I'm a neurosurgeon and that was clearly a case of, uh, uh, foodal chokage. Alright, look, I got to tell you something.
Don't worry, it's out there! I think I just need lunch.
All right. Hey Rach, while you're in there, throw something on Alicia Mae.
So are guys doing okay?
What? I'm not allowed to know smart women?
Maybe. Well, I just think you guys can do better than this house, you know? Or any other house for that matter.
I don't know.
Oh come on man, you can dance with my partner, she's real, uh, mellow!
No you can't do that, where would the chick and the duck live?
One! No ten! You said ten! You can't take that back!
It really hit me last night. I'm gonna be on Days of our Lives. And then I started thinkin' about all of u, and how these are the days of our lives..
Come on Ross be realistic, y'know? If I did write something, what are the chances I could get those guys to star in it?
Okay.
Ahh. What the hell are you doing to me man.
Thanks, Rach. Look, you guys are just terrific. Y'know? Now, how about clearing out of here so I can get some new customers. It's all about turnover.
Okay, fine.
You just give him a spoon baby!
I've been here the whole time!
Yeah, I just got off the Internet! Man, there is a lot of porn out there!
Fine.
Yeah-eah! 200 dollar reward, split five ways!!
Yeah! Yeah y'know, like warm up the crowd. Ask 'em where they're from. 'Cause in Joey Tribbiani you get a minister and you get an entertainer. I'm a minis-tainer! There is no one better! There is no one greater!
Ah, yes, The Plan!
Oh right, right.
Did you not hear the plot of the movie? "She's been dead for ten years." I'm gonna be a millionaire!
You hung up on the pizza place? I don't hang up on your friends.
It's been a while, huh? Wow, it's funny these halls look smaller then they used to.
Okay look Rach, I know this is a lot. You don't have to say anything. You-you uh, you take as much time as you need. Okay, you gotta say something!
Yeah, you don't want that.
Done! I did it! Heh, who's stupid now?
It'll be great for next weekend.
Yeah, whatever.
Ah!! Okay! Eyes open at all times! Oh, hey, how do we decide where we... y'know each would, y'know be?
So you're ruling out surrogacy?
But you said he was this great guy!
Oh, oh, I got it! Pete-Chicago.
C'mon, you guys. This is a real movie, and Al Pacino's in it, and that's big!
Do you want any help?
All right, you know what? We don't have a choice. It's like I would have said in that sci-fi movie if I'd gotten the part. "Those are our men in there, we have to get them out! Even if I have to sacrifice the most important thing in my life; my time-machine."
Uhhh, Phoebe and Joey.
Kinda.
You seen Sandy?
What is it?
I guess so. I'm just... really nervous.
Yeah-yeah, I told her about the time you got drunk and fell asleep with your head in the toilet.
Hey no problem.
Okay, relationship, boy this could take a while.
Me too.
Dude, tell me she actually told you this.
Ok, ok, How about if we split it?
Hey guys. Listen uh, you wanna get some dinner with me and Kathy tonight?
Oh, that's cool. We have interns at 'Days Of Our Lives'.
Yeah, right!.......Y'serious?
It's pretty, Okay date of birth?
Oh no-no, it's uh, it's not what you think. We uh, we used it to, you know, fling water balloons off the roof. Remember that, those junior high kids couldn't even get theirs accross the street.
Huh.
Pathetic mess? I know, butcome on, man, she's needy, she's vulnerable. I'm thinkin', cha-ching! Thanks. Look, you have not been out with a woman since Janice. You're doin' this.
Let's get out of here.
: Ahhh, that's alright. Y'know, that's a tough hand to beat.
I gotta get the before shot!
Oh my God!
Hit me! Hit me!
That's right! I helped you guys out a lot in the start of your relationship. Huh? I helped you guys sneak around for like six months, and I looked like an idiot! And I was humiliated. And I only made 200 dollars!
Okay, Monica picks ten, I call nine! Anyone else?
Oh my God.
I set her up with this actor on my show.
What is it?
Sure! Why not?!
What? You think I'm too dumb to understand that a husband needs to be with his wife? Huh? Do you think I'm like, "Duh."
What picture?!
You can come in, but your filter-tipped little buddy has to stay outside!
Yeah, Monica made us!
Die Hard!!!!!!
All right.
Hey! Mine was by accident! All right, the boiler explodes and destroys the hotel, and kills the dad.
Can I change a hundred?
Oh you should, it's great.
Thank you!
I know, I know, but look at the knobs on her.
Hey! So I'm back.
How ya doin'?
"When I think of the love that these two givers and receivers share, I can not help but envy the lifetime ahead of having and loving and giving and..." And then I can't think of a good word for right here.
Oh my God! What did you say?
How about 'cause if you don't, his mother might.
WATER BALLOON!
If you want I could loan you some money?
Hey!
Dude, this isn't funny! What am I gonna do?! I go to bed last night, everything's cool! I wake up this morning, the stripper's gone and the ring is gone!
Her answer machine?
You spent a hundred dollars. That's the limit. You're screwed!
Ross, hey, the band's ready outside for your first dance with Emily, so...
Yeah you got 5 years left!
What?!
Oh my god, I got my very own stalker.
Ugh.
Cool, thanks.
Yeah, that was a tricky one. In reality, that operation takes like, over 10 hours, but they only showed it for 2 minites.
Okay, Ross, look-look-look-look, look right here. That's called a scrum, okay? It's kinda like a huddle.
IN LONDON!!!
Oh, and how is Allison?
Or, I could just point to it! Huh? Blah, blah, blah, Purina One, point to a bag today. I didn't get it, did I?
Oh, now I have to go!!
Hey.
No-no.
Okay, if Ross and Rachel ask, I've been here the whole time. THE WHOLE TIME!
Hey.
It's like the cheapest college ever.
Yeah!
All right that's it! You're yelling and I don't see you taking your top off! I quit!
Hey...
Yeah! How you doin'? Yeah alright!
Hey Rach listen, did you know that during pregnancy your fingers swell up to twice their size and never go back.
Which what?
Thank you. Thank you.
Yeah, I-I think that women just have a lower threshold of pain than men, that's all. I mean, come on, it's just a little wax.
But it's available now! Isn't it?
Uh, no, she's at dance class.
It was amazing! And not just for her... uh-uh. For me, too. It's like, all of a sudden, I'm blind. But all my other senses are heightened, y'know? It's like... I was able to appreciate it on another level.
All right, you're right. I'll talk to her.
No-no-no! Look, I've been thinking about it. I'm an actor right? So I won't get nervous talking in front of people.
Well I got stuff going on in here if you wanna feel.
Yeah, you hang in there Teddy!
Hey!
Oh! Hey Rach, listen umm...
Hey Ross, wouldn't it be great if we could go two straight hours without dropping it?!
Oh my God! How many of these things did you have? These are pure vodka.
To her parent's I think and she said you shouldn't call her. But if I were you I would.
Wow! Huh? Mac Macaveli, Private Investigator!
Oh my God, you guys have no idea.
Aww, there we go.
Oh yeah-yeah, the lobster.
Morning.
No can do amigo. No, I didn't use the computer. Felt more personal to hand-write it.
I know! That's why they trashed me!
I'm always on the swings! What am I doing wrong?!
You think?
I Gotcha!!
Oh my God.
Ah well, the ah, Pennsylvania Dutch, come from Pennsylvania.
That's always appropriate! Oh, okay. One more push! One more push!
Phoebe's a porn star!
Oh, uh, okay, how, how about now?
Sure, neighbor come on in.
816, thank you!
Yeah.
Chandler Bing.
Now let's not ruin this day. You worked so hard. Let's move past this and try to have a nice meal all together, huh?
Thanks for everything Estelle. Bye. "out of area". Boy, I'll say.
Yeah, me too.
Hey, you can't say you're breezy, that, that totally negates the breezy.
Sure.
Right.
Oh mommie, oh daddie, I am a big old baddie! Oh mommie, oh daddie, I am a big old baddie!
It's Joey.
I'm Joey! I'm an actor! I don't know squat about dinosaurs!
Oh, here's where I win all my money back!
Friends first? That's interesting.
I have to go to the bathroom too, but I don't want him complimenting my thing.
Hey guys!
Wha...? You're gonna go now? I thought we could hang out?
I don't! No, I wanna live with the super-hot Australian dancer.
Many are scheduled to appear.
Dude! What are yo-you trying to kill me?!
So...
You bet I do! I just ah, wasn't listening then, that's all.
Alright thanks, Oh hey have you talked to Chandler?
All right, I'll see you guys.
Uh, they're like my best friends. Are you saying we can't hang out with them? 'Cause that would kinda be a problem.
You couldn't do it?!
Well, I only said that because of Ross, you know. Then I saw him kissing Charlie...
I know, she may be the hottest girl I've ever hated.
Thanks Ross.
No. Why?
Hey Monica, what's on this video tape?
Uh, actually, that's..
Oh, you're switching apartments?
Yeah! Well, well really it's three. Please. You're so good at it. I love you.
Well, I was thinking that it'd probably be okay because Ross hasn't gone out with Rachel in five years!
Yeah-yeah-yeah, and they had that beer! That uh...
Why not?
Yeah, yeah, and directing.
Half the taste is in the smell! You-you're sucking up all the tastiness!
Yeah, the ah, trees that don't fulfil their Christmas destiny are thrown in the chipper.
Nothing, I'm just practicing blowing you off because I'm gonna be a big movie star!
Yeah.
Hey.
Which helps him get to Phase Three, picturing yourself with other women.
Never had that dream.
Yeah, you got a couple hours?
You can't do anything!
Hey, when the doctor does that hernia test...
This is it! This is my category.
Joey Tribbiani, a big fan.
Really? You'd-you'd do that for me?!
No. I don't think so.
Yeah.
I miss this.
I don't know, birds just don't say, "Hello, sit here, eat something."
Wow, it's big!
All right, Ross!
Right, they uh, they choppered me in. What's up?
All right! Thanks! You're the best! Now listen, the last day of auditions is Thursday. Okay? So I gotta get in there by Thursday. Okay? Just remember Thursday. Thursday. Can you remember Thursday?
Can we drop this? I am not interested in the guy's apartment.
That's the fastest I have ever thought!
No, no. See, you and Drake are having a fight.
A couple? Like two people? Like one , two people?
Hey uh, what's a matter?
She made me switch to light Mayo. That's it! That's all I got! And, you know what? It tastes the same and my pants fit better!
You sure are naming a lot of ways to postpone sex, I'll tell ya...
Hey!!
I can't believe she would say that too you.
Shouldn't we all vote on stuff like this?!
Ooh, very official.
Hey, good race you guys.
Oh, yeah, I do.
Rach, these are for you.
Oh, oh, oh, sorry.
Pretty good.
Have a nice six more months Ross!
Good for you!!
Exactly! All right, everybody, listen up. The coffeehouse is going to be closed for about an hour.
No.
Hey Ross. This probably isn't the best time to bring it up, but you have to throw a party for Monica.
Ahh, forget about it, I'm havin' a ball. How's the apartment doin'
Okay.
Wait a minute, did you just make up all that stuff just to get out of being my agent.
Oh ... Happy birth ... oh, see you later.
And I got custody of the kid, right? Now suppose the kid dies and-and I gotta buy a new kid.
I can't believe what I'm hearing here.
Aww, I don't know Monica y'know... erm... lending friends money is always a mistake.
Okay. Okay.
I'm sure it's a famous watering can, okay. But, come on...and what is with the really hot stick in the bathroom?
Who-ah-ho.
Dude I just did something terrible.
You are so the man! Now look, listen, listen, you got to be cool, 'cause my Grandma doesn't know about you two yet, and you do not want to tick her off. She was like the sixth person to spit on Mussolini's hanging body. Yeah.
Yeah! Yeah Monica! You listen to me, okay? And I'm not just saying this because I'm your friend, I'm sayin' it 'cause it's the truth. You're food is abysmal!
Wait, wait, wait!
Hey, Pheebs! Check-check this out.
Oh! Yeah, look there's this play all right? And I'm up for the part of this real cool like suave international guy. A real clothes horse. So I figure that everyone at the audition is gonna be wearing this kinda y'know, ultra-hip, high fashion stuff.
That's some gentle comedy, dude.
Not so much.
Sure! I would love to wait with you guys! Thanks!
Hey.
Hello?
I don't know.
See?
Hey, what have you guys been up too?
Thank you so much.
What?
Bye!
Hey! Let me ask you guys something. I have a new headshot taken tomorrow right and the photographer said she thinks Ishould have my eyebrows waxed. Is that weird for a guy?
Just being friendly.
If you said it like that, you probably did, yeah.
Yeah, life's pretty great isn't it?

No, we didn't even pay our cable bill-maybe this is how they punish us.
I, I don't get you. I mean first, you hate me. Then you sleep with me. Then you want nothing to do with me, now you want me again.
Hey.
Yeah, maybe he just cheated on you.
All right, it's another commercial; I still haven't told her!
Err... Kind of.
Um, this?
No.
Hey, Julie, I didn't know you wore lenses.
Bikini, French cut, thong! And-and the fabrics! You've got cotton, silk, lace! And y'know what I've always wondered about?
Yeah, here we are. Uhh... I... I think I'm...falling in love with you.
Hey!
All right!!! Okay!! All right! Okay-okay, I gotta get started on my speech! Oh, wait a minute, Internet ministers can still have sex right?
Oh, I love you too.
She's probably exhausted from all that adorable screaming she did last night.
Thanks.
Seriously?
In Bizarro World!! You broke the code!
I AM NOT GONNA HELP YOU DO THAT! Goodbye!
2,000 bucks is a lot of money. Oh, I wish I had a twin. Where could I find someone who looks exactly like me?
Sure. Here. I'll uh, save your parking spot.
Well all right then, I guess I shouldn't get to excited about the fact that I just kissed her!
All right. Let's get the contestants out of their isolation booths. And they're off!
Pheebs?
Well, so, will you help me? I really wanna be in this play.
Look, my best friends are getting married in like an hour. Okay? And I'm the minister. Please! Please! Can you pull it together?
Oh, ah, tour guide at the museum. Yeah, Ross got it for me.
I just have to call my agent and tell her I can't do the part.
Hey!
Bye, bye.
You're leaving too?
Maybe that's the problem.
Why not? You'll feel better! I'll feel better, and you know you want to. I can see it in your eyes.
pel.
No! It's not okay! It's not okay at all!! You're dead inside!!
Yeah. With a bite! Gee-e-e-eez!
The Irish gig guy?!
Angela? Joey Tribiani. Listen, what are ya doing tonight. I know your seeing that guy I was thinking maybe you could bring him.....Hello? Hello?
Yeah!
Oh, I like that, yeah. Wasn't at the parade because I had a family emergency.
Uh, hang out?! How long?
Oh! ah! eh... Britney Spears!?
Probably Monica and Chandler.
"Thanks."
I just wanted to come by and y'know, wish you good luck on your date.
but, but..
...I'm his butt double. 'Kay? I play Al Pacino's butt. Alright? He goes into the shower, and then- I'm his butt.
You want to see her again, right?
Well, safer. Y'know, I mean I never start reading The Shining, without making sure we've got plenty of room in the freezer, y'know.
I'm gonna do it.
So I uh, I just talked to the director. That's it, we're done for the day.
Now let's not get carried away.
That's my line! I can take it from here, thanks. Dearly beloved, I'm sorry I'm a little late. You may be confused by this now, but you won't be Memorial Day weekend 2002. Well, let's get started before the groom takes off again. Huh? We are gathered here today, to join this man and this woman in the bonds of holy matrimony. I've known Monica and Chandler for a long time, and I can not imagine two people more perfect for each other. And now, as I've left my notes in my dressing room. We shall proceed to the vows. Monica?
I could teach you a speech that I memorized for auditions.
Whoa. Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Hey, I do it every week with three cameras pointed at me and a whole crew waiting!
Uh, well he's 33.
I know!
No-no-no I've seen it happen, you-you get a rapport going with a woman but somehow you manage to kill it. What's your secret?
Whoo-hoo!
Oh my God. You and Rachel?
I don't need that anymore.
No, no, no. You actually did that when you were dancing to the Chicago-soundtrack. Look, Ross, about, about Rachel and I. Listen, you don't have to worry about that, okay? Because nothing is gonna happen.
What's that now? Opening credits.
I know!
Oh. Maybe. But hey I know how I can find out. We're going to a New Year's Eve party, right? So at midnight, I can kiss her. And if she kisses me back, great! Y'know? But if she says 'Dude, what the hell are you doing?' I can say 'It wasn't me, it was New Years!'
Hello Mr. Bing...I love you.
Good night.
Come on! Do something!
How do you mean?
I'll take it back tomorrow.
Hey! Wanna play some foosball? Please?
Ok, yeah, got it.
Bye-bye.
I understand...
So? What-what-what happened?
You know, I think I was sixteen.
Ah, can I just say I know we're doing this for Ross, and that's cool, but if it was up to me, this is not what we'd be doing on our first date.
Oh... food. No, sex. Food! Sex! Food! Se-I don't know! Good God, I don't know, I want girls on bread!
Hey! How you doin'?
You kissed my girlfriend!
....yeah... what else?
Ok-ay. I just, I can't believe you're calling me?
Judge rules, no violation.
Maybe I could be a waiter. Could I use the phone?
I'm loud!
Still not hot enough!
We're 29, we're not women.
There's this woman, that I like. A lot. Well, it's complicated. She's with this other guy. For a long time. And I could never do that to the guy, y'know? 'Ccause we're really good friends.
Yeah! Yeah! Right down there. Hey listen; let me give you a little tip. Do not take a nap on this stoop or you can wake up with your shoes gone.
Get your non-believer ass outta my chair!
Oh, I am going to go for a walk in the rain.
Oh my God, I'm sorry, I'm being so rude. Rachel, would like a soda or something? Because Chandler would run right out and get it.
Can you believe this place?
I'd be lying if I said I haven't thought about it myself. Chandler is my best friend, it would be wrong. Good......But wrong.
I didn't do that! Who would've done that?!
Oh uh, can I give you a hand?
Can't help you, I'm not wearing any.
Don't do it!
Thank you. Waiter! 'lright, this is gonna be fast, so try to keep up: Risotto with the shaped truffles and the roasted rip steak with the golden Chanterelles and a Bordelaise sauce and that any that stuff I just said means snails.
Well I don't know remember exactly but, it's-it's pretty much about having and giving and sharing and receiving.
But you two were supposed to be together.
Wait a second, I could star in it!
Yeah, yeah, I guess.
What happened?
Ok, you're gonna come back with some very classy clothes... ... and some slutty lingerie, SLUTTY!
So did that do anything for ya?
What?!?!
Yeah, it's for the kids. To keep the kids off drugs. It's a very important issue in this month's Playboy. I'm sure you all read about it.
What about her? They've only been going out for two weeks. Ross has been in love with you for like 10 years.
Oh! Hey, somebody left their keys. Ooohh, to a Porsche! Hey Gunther, these yours?
Hey, thank you so much.
Well, they wanna see me again this afternoon, but, err, well, Lennart Haze did not like me.
All right, I'm gonna go say hi the chick and the duck.
Just put it on a plate and leave.
Alright, come on you guys, it's not that big a deal. Really... I mean, I just go down there every other day and... make my contribution to the project. Hey, hey, but at the end of two weeks, I get seven hundred dollars.
Hey man, look sorry about that Archie thing. Do uh, do you need me to give you some money?
I left them at the park.
No one.
What?! That's not fair! It's not my fault! I was off with my bride's maid! And who's to say I would've even said yes?! I mean I would've said yes. Chandler look y-y-you are making way to big a deal out of this, all right? Look, everything worked out okay!
Yeah.
Why not?
Wow! Well then I'll just have to carry you.
Way to be strong, man!
I-I did! I told her everything, Chandler! But she wouldn't believe me.
Oh, Kath, we should get going. We're going to by hamsters.
What can I do? Look, I don't want to do anything to screw it up with Ursula.
I guess not.
Yeah, and so funny!
I know, I know! But I've thought about it a lot since, and it just wouldn't be right... I'm sorry...!
Oh-ooh, that's the turn-on.
I'm...happy...for you?
Have you seen Monica?
Chandler!
What?!?! Oh dear God!
So... who's your friend?
Well, where was I?
Also so gay!
No ma'am.
Alright alright. You're a monkey. You're loose in the city. Where do you go?
Well that's like summer in a bowl.
Well, maybe we can just tip the table a little.
Hey, hey, hey, hey! I'm not gonna mess with Jack, he's a great man, he fought for our country.
Sorry!
No, it's not, we have nothing in common!
Uhh, rub it?
What is that?
Wait a minute! Why don't I do what that guy did? I'll take this $100 and turn it into $5,000! And then I'll turn that into enough money to get my movie going again!
No. No way, I'm not signing that.
I don't know. I guess there's just always been this distance y'know-I mean we both try to pretend it's not there, but it is.
What?
You're fake laughing too, right?
David Lynn! David Lynn! David Lynn!!
I know I should've. "I'm sorry."
How could you not remember that we slept together?
You-you have to pay that! It's not just a guess.
Thank you. Yeah, I appreciate that.
Kiss her! Kiss her!
Shut-out!!
Wow. Good speech.
Uh-oh. I hade a pretty hectic day at work too, today I had to open a door and go ohhhh!
Oh my God! I overslept! I was supposed to be on the set a half an hour ago! I gotta get out of here!
Hey, see that? He just needed his pal to come home. All right, uh, I've got to go memorise my lines. Me and Charlton Heston bright and early tomorrow morning! Yeah-yeah!
No, not that one. We're trying to figure out who to bring to the Knicks game tonight, we have an extra ticket.
What's the matter with Rog?
Baywatch.
....Are we still talking about sex?
All right. Chandler, you can either spin the wheel or pick a Google card.
Hey, how you doin'?
Uh... Phoebe? Phoebe?
Where?
Well, she graduated from high school!
What?!! That's even worse!!
For just you?
Urse...
Dahhhhh!! No! Noooo!!
Uh, you gotta press the button.
Okay.
I don't know. Just uh, just tell 'em it was a mix-up with the invitations, or-No-no-no! Blame it on the post office. They hate the post office. And the Irish! But I don't think you can blame it on them so...
Keep going Pinocchio!
Wow, it is easy. Now, I can have milk everyday.
Porsche.
I didn't know it was an auction!
Hey, I need your help.
Hey!
Uh yeah, right here.
Ahhhhhhhhhhhh.... That-that-that's really just to show where the baby would go. Y'know why don't I hold on to him so that there's no confusion?
Anybody gonna eat that?
I'll take those to go. For the kids.
What?
Come on. This guy's great. His name's Bob. He's Angela's... brother. He's smart, he's sophisticated, and he has a real job. Me, I go on three auditions a month and call myself an actor, but Bob is...
Come on!
I got time.
Yeah.
Yeah, you could go to the game with me, ah, even though I know you said you couldn't. But then you lied to me and tricked me and gave me a bump on the head.
Noooo!!
What is he doing? What, Emily, thinks Ross's furniture has got Rachel coodies?
That would be Casey. We're going out tonight.
There you go!
How'd you get to that?
Because I forgot about our date, I'm so sorry.
Really? I can do it?
Monica face it, Chandler is against marriage. And-and always will be!
Hi!
Hey man, what's up?
Yesterday at my audition, I really had to pee, and apparently, having to pee makes me a really good actor. I got a call-back, so I'm drinking everything. Oh, by the way, that egg nog in our fridge was great!
Okay. Okay, I totally hear ya. Oo how about this? I vamp a little 'til they get there?
What, what!? it's for her hot friends!
Can we please turn this off?
Where you going?
Uhh, 11!
Yeah, okay but look, buy uh-Hey-hey, y'know, y'know who else I like? You! And it-it doesn't get said enough. I like you Ross.
I, ah, I never said hate, I was very careful about that.
Good luck, and uh, take care, huh?
Dude! How come you took off?
That's a nice picture. Maybe you can still have that!
Well can you at least stay to the end of the play? I mean, I'll go to the airport with ya, I-I wanna say good bye.
That's how they do pants! Ross, will you tell him? Isn't that how they measure pants?
Hey and everbody is so nice. I just had a good talk with that lady with the red hair, Jeannie.
Hey, Pheebs! It's Joey!
Huh, Rach I got to say it's gonna take a lot of money for me to go out on a date with a dude.
And I was tired from digging the huge hole!
Damnit!! Did you move?!
Hey, the ad alone cost 300 bucks!
All right, here's a list of things for you to do today. Man, this going to be so great! Thank you so much! All right, I got to go to work I'm delivering twins today, but only one of them is mine!
Relish!
How could you lose him?
Oh.
Hey, what are you guys gonna do?
Awful! Horrible!
Or ha-ha, we could go over there and pee on them.
Alright open your eyes.
How ya doin'? Welcome. Good to see ya!
46. Wow! Who's well educated now, Mr. I-forgot-ten-states?
What the hell's the matter with you?! This is my favourite jersey.
Did you get it?
I'm movin' out like we talked about.
No, an entertainment unit, with a mail cubby built right in. It's a one day job, max.
Hi.
Well, I've been thinking about this whole commercial thing, y'know me going up against Ben, the two of us competing, and that can't lead to anything good. So, I think I'm just gonna step aside. I'm gonna tell them that I won't audition.
Yeah! Look!
No! All right, who-who makes up the questions?
What are you gonna do?
Yeah. Cushions the blow.
There will come a time in each of your careers when you'll have a chance to screw over another soap opera actor. I had such an opportunity in the recent, present. And I'm ashamed to say that I took it, I advised a fellow actor to play a role, homosexually. Yeah, we both auditioned for the part, and uh, as it turned out, they ah, they liked the stupid gay thing and cast him. And now, he's got a two year contract opposite Susan Luchhi, the first lady of daytime television, and me, me I'm stuck here teaching a bunch of people, most of whom are too ugly to even be on TV. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Thank you.
What's the big deal? You just say what you want to do to her. Or what you want her to do to you. Or what you think other people might be doing to each other. I'll tell you what. Just try something on me.
No, I'm picking you up for our date. These are for you.
Whoa-whoa, don't we need to do some kinda preparation first? Like ahh, get really drunk?
You fell asleep!! There was no kangaroo! They didn't take any of my suggestions! That's for coming buddy. I'll see you later.
You look like a freak.
How're you doing?
All right, I'm gonna go!
Well, get ready to come out of the non-gay closet!
No, no, no!
What am I gonna do, I feel like I'm losing my friends.
Hi.
Yeah, the man wreaks! Smells like he went on a three day fishing trip and then ate some liquorice.
Ahhh!
Oh yeah, sure. No problem.
Yeah! And I like to hang out in a quiet place where I can talk to my friends.
What? Ace is high! Jack, queen, king, ace!
Boy I tell ya, that judging stuff took a lot out of me.
You got a better idea?
All right, hold on! Hold on. Hold on. This is Ross, okay? He's our friend. He obviously went crazy. He obviously lost his mind.
What? Me having a job?
Frankie? What're you talking about?
And you'll be nice?
Thank you.
Because I think this character is going to be suspicious about stuff.
Hey... hey listen... What do you guys know about investments?
Oh, come on! I wanna hear it! It wouldn't be Thanksgiving without Chandler bumming us out!
Hey you guys, check it out. Check it out. It's like it's coming right at me.
Ken Adams!!
Ross, you need some help?
You'd tell me if you were moving out right
Yeah!
Mom, so what did you think?
Orrr, you could follow him and see where he goes.
No.
Chandler, Chandler, y'know what we should do? You and I should go out and get some new sunglasses.
Thursday's clearly not good for ya, pick a day!
Phonetically?
Thata girl! Huh? We should get out of here; there's a new class comin' in.
Why not?!
Die Hard 2.
Hey. I was just gonna get something to eat. You want something?
This is how much we pay for electric?!!!
Kinda have a... a thing for the Days Of Our Life's people.
Yeah!
Good night!
You're a masseuse. You have a table with a hole in it.
Over the line?! You-you're-you're so far past the line, that you-you can't even see the line! The line is a dot to you!
That is so not my motto.
Sure?
Thanks for coming Mrs. Greene. Well, ok, you take care.
We dare.
Yeah. Sure.
Yeah I knew what you were talkin' about.
Yeah, I wouldn't know about that.
Yeah.
Are you strippers?
Then why would you say that?!
Why do I smell men's cologne?
Hey.
Oh well, you're timing couldn't be better. I am putting out fires all over the place.
Oh, yeah.
Well, with Dr. Drake they always tell me what to say. And with Joey, I pretty much have to make it up on my own.
But then you left.
Hey!
Sort of.
Oh, what about that thing he did when he tipped the guy who showed us to our seats. You never even saw the money, it was like this. Hey Chandler, thanks for showing us to our seats .
Oh my God!
... It's a fertility study.
Ooh! Well played, Phoebe Buffay, well played.
Nice. Oh hey, what about Ross?
Say hello to the new champ of Chandler's dumb states game.
Ooh, sorry. Sorry. You finish, go.
What are you doing?
Oh wow! He's so lifelike! Unbelievable! (He starts tugging on the guy's ears.
Awwwww!! Awwwwwww!!!
Just what needs to be done! Dearly beloved, we are gathered here to join this man and this woman...
Rach, I told you everything I knew last night! Look, it's not that big of a deal, so Monica and Chandler are doing it.
Hey, that guy's going home with more than a note!
Okay, I see what's going on here.
Oh, how bad is it?
Yeaah.
Thanks man.
Yeah, and there won't be a relationship left to rebuild.
Hey, what's up?
Hey, for what it's worth, with Rachel I don't think you'll ever be just "anybody."
Alright, well the rest of you get comfortable, ok, because we're gonna be here for a li... Wait a minute, there is a window in there!
No! I'm putting that in my room.
I got it.
Hey, hey, Chan. She could work for you.
Oh that's okay. Hey, actually in a way it's kinda nice. Me, bringing the food of my ancestors, you, the food of yours!
Uhh, I'm guessing the threshold's clear now.
No.
Sorry.
Aww, man. That's the girl I was hiding from. When she finds out he's my roommate, she's gonna tell him what I did.
Why not?
When's that?
Hey!
Nothing!
No you didn't!
What? Whoo... What?
Cheese makes me thirsty.
Oh uh, ordinarily I would love too, but I am just swamped right now.
What? You ordered pizza without me?!
Well usually...yeah! Well, not just lemonade, iced tea, sometimes juice. Well, sorry, I just, I thought you liked me. I'm such a jerk.
Ooh, look-look-look-look-look! I got Monica naked!
No.
Here. Now I only owe you $49.50.
Hey!
Okay.
Oh uh, me and Ross can be the judges.
Oh yeah, yeah! He's done tons of commercials. I've seen him in like Sugar Smacks, Playstation, and that one for the phone company. In fact he was so good in that one, he actually convinced me to switch phone companies. Chandler was mad....
A little foos?
Yeah, take a hike wetpants!
What else?
I'm on top of the world, looking down on creation and the only explanation I can find...
A little uh, good deed for PBS and a little TV exposure, now that's the kind of math Joey likes to do!
Yeah bye-bye! Hey! So just a light layer?
Hey, you guys are still gonna come visit me, right?
Hey-hey guys, hey! How about we settle this over a friendly game of Fireball? Huh? I'll go unhook the smoke detectors!
What, so I gotta shut it down now?
So, you'd hire me, right?
Yeah, and when you do, he'll be lucky to have you.
Yeah
It's not that far! Just drop!
No!
Oh yeah. If you ah, move your hamper, you see what color the tile used to be. Yeah.
"You know!"
Yeah, is Sidney there? Oh, this is? Sidney's a woman.
Yeah.
Wait a second, wait a second, where have I seen that cowgirl outfit before...
Wanna play strip poker for practice?
The hell with hockey, let's all do that!
Says who? Your mom?
Why are they doing this?
I've got Ben.
Absolutely! And if it doesn't, can I get the extra ticket?
I said no.
Saw a girl with that vest.
Look, I don't hate Janice, she's-she's just a lot to take, you know.
But it's dark out.
Oh no, can't invite her. She also steals.
Great! Thanks, Rach!
Ewwwww!
Didn't I tell ya? Always showin' off.
Yeah. Joseph and his wife, Karen, are thinking of having a third kid... Ya know what? Just did.
Chandler, I can't be playing games, Ross is gonna be home soon. And I have to write five whole pages if I'm gonna stick to his schedule.
I know, I'm sorry, but can I just have a quick second to run to the bathroom?
Maybe you are a nurse, but you moonlight as a waitress.
Setting the table.
I know! Neither did I!
Yeah, he's the best.
All right! You can have the chair.
What about me, he? Only had one lunch today.
Well, suppose until the baby's born I laid off it. No extra animals would die, you-you'd just be eating my animals.
Uh-huh!
PBS telethon.
Yeah, it's okay. I know what a mainsail is. I know, I know to duck when the boom comes across. I-I know port is right.
Haven't you ever read the same book over and over again?
Oh-ho-ho, you think I don't know what breaks my fridge? Excuse me! Well what do you know! Broken! That'll be $400!
Will you grow up? I'm not talking about sexy stuff, but, like, when I'm cooking naked.
No, only for sex.
Hey-hey-hey, hey that's your wife you're talking about!
Uhh, look, your eye's still popping out a little, I'm gonna go get some ice.
Hey!
Richard told Monica he wants to marry her!
Come on!!
I gotta a lot of nice stuff to say about you guys, ok? And I know how much you wanna have a baby, you know, and I would love to help you get one.
Hey!
Hey.
Hey! You hold on pal! Now you made my friend, Rachel, cry. So now, you're gonna go up there and apologize to her, unless you want me to call the landlord.
He's not really my type.
Okay...
Oh, I had the opposite dream.
Yeah, you can get a Volvo. If that's what you really want.
We have to find the rest of the platoon!
Fine! Do you want something to drink?
Big fat goalie.
Hi.
Yeah. Whew, it's hot with all of this stuff on. I ah, I better not do any, I don't know, lunges.
Ross, you're mayor of the zone.
Listen, uh, I don't know when I'm gonna see you again.
See after the scene, Mr. Beatty comes up to me and says 'good actor, bad kisser'. Can you believe that, me not a good kisser, that's like, like Mother Theresa, not a good mother.
Hey! Don't you hang up on me! I'll marry you and me right now! I have the power!
Hey Phoebe!
Hey!
All right, then you'd better show me some of that too then.
Okay, take it easy.
Sure! Where are the seats?
It's okay, it's okay Rach, it's me. Put down the scrunchy.
Problem solved.
Monkey lover!
No-no, stay right there. Gettin' closer.
I can't tell you what I know.
Hold it hold it. I gotta side with Chandler on this one. When I first moved to the city, I went out a couple of times with this girl, really hot, great kisser, but she had the biggest Adam's apple. It made me nuts.
Hey, y'know what a really good rainy day game is?
Bye bye Mike!/Cya mike!/Bye mike!/Bye bye now!
Oh, tell me about it. And she's been on the show forever, it's gonna be really hard to fill her shoes.
Y'know what? I don't need this! Okay? I don't know why you're dumping all over my big break.
Really?
Oh, hey let me.
Dude, I'm just trying to speak your language.
Hi!
What happens if you flick it?
What do ya say? What do ya say?
Oo...what's in the bag?
Mark's a genius!
Enough said, I'm there for you man. Where is she, upstairs?
Thank you!
Oh-hoh! Ha-hah! See!
Whoo, whoo. Wow, it's uhm... kinda weird that I'm sitting next to Charlie after we broke up.
Oh hey come on, don't-don't-don't do this! Umm, look let-let me tell you something, okay? Now when I watch you do a scene, I'm thinking, "Boy, she-she is a great actress!" Uh but-but, I am also thinking, "She is hot!"
Say it... say it!
Emma? Hey! Hi!
Somebody opened the door to the coffee house and a raccoon came running in, went straight for your muffin and I said "Hey don't eat that-that's Phoebe's" and he said.. He said.. "Joey you stink at lying." What am I going to do?
Whoa!!!
I can't tell you what I'm wishing for! Else...you know...won't come true!
No way! 'Kay look, if I have to go to the doctor for anything it's gonna be for this thing sticking out of my stomach!
Uh listen, here's your Soapie. I accepted it for ya.
Hey, that'd work on me! Why did I get to buy Mrs. Butterwords?
Hello! Oh yeah! It's the apartment manager; Ross put us down as references. Ross is the greatest guy you'll ever meet! Yeah, he's very reliable.
This is so cool!
Uh, take a look at the guy's pants! I mean, I know you told us to show excitement, but don't you think he went a little overboard?
But I-I-I can't stay too long, I gotta get up early for a commercial audition tomorrow and I gotta look good. I'm supposed to be playing a 19-year-old. What?
I don't wanna give up the bag. I don't have to give up the bag! Do I Rach? Oh, you think I should give up the bag!
Hey, this is a little extra somethin' for uh, ya know, always bein' there for me.
NO!!!
Hey!
Yeah! Good night!
Ross, Ross, Ross... It's okay.
No! No, no you can't quit! You're the best agent I ever had! Look Pheebs, rejection is part being an actor, you can't take it personally.
Oh, see that's where you're wrong. Whatever it is I can do it. And if didn't see it up there, just-just try me.
Okay. "Hey, Timmy, I've got a surprise for you."
Someone like an...angel?
Look, look let's pretend it's a real bachelor party. Okay? Y'know? Before your wedding. Come on, it'll be fun.
Sure it is! She needs a pen for work, she's writing, she turns it over.... "Whoa! It's time for my date with Joey!"
Oh! Ohh! Oh!!
Oh my god, you're right!
Hey, you know our phone's not working?
Morning!
Don't worry man, I get to bring a guest. We'll show him.
Monica, look... I don't think you and I have any secrets anymore... Not ready to joke about it yet, okay, I see you later.
It's a one-woman play called "Why don't you like me: a bitter woman's journey through life".
Ahh, I'm gonna go get some chicken. Want some?
Uh, I scratched it on the ATM machine down on the corner.
Ooh! Tough odds!
Maybe this should be more of a quiet game.
Okay, here's my big scene. My big scene's here! Oh my God.
Oh! It all looks so beautiful: the turkey, the stuffing...
About a month ago this guy spent the night with Rachel, I didn't see who it was but...
Look, my agent hooked me up with six tickets to a great play.
Sorry.
'Tonight' tonight?
Dad, Ronni's here.
Sure, what do you want to see?
That wasn't a real date?! What the hell do you do on a real date?
Dry cleaners?
Something like that?
Half hour.
I call it!!
Oh, I...I d-
Ok.
Oh hey-hey!
All right, I'll see you in the morning.
Oh, c'mon, I mean, there's you, then there's Charlie, and it's like... What the hell is my problem? OH!
Oh, yeah, sure, easy for you, you're young. Me, I'm set in my ways.
How's she doing?
I'm gonna be in the waitin' room, handing out cigars.
Would she? You ate my candy bar!
Oh, hey, how about this? Wanna be an extra on my show?
Hey! I'm getting a little tired of this okay? We said we're sorry. It's Thanksgiving for Pete's sakes! A day of forgiveness!
You know it's funny you should mention that 'cause I was thinkin'... what's with the boxes?
Ah-haah! I win!!
Right, and you go with Rachel, Bonnie's free tonight?
They gave me the shaft all right.
Mmmm. Good.
Maybe now you can actually do it. You know? You can finally get over her.
Yes sir! Yes sir, I'm-I'm-
Well, there are so many things, it's hard to pick just one.
Oh that's right. There's a lot going on here and I think I ate some bad fruit earlier.
I'm serious. You're amazing. You know when to spritz, when to lay back.
But sadly I could not be enticed.
No I won't.
You bet! What's the part?
It's like if you woke up one day and found out your dad was leading this double life. He's like actually some spy, working for the C.I.A. That'd be cool.... This blows!
Chandler? What're you still doin' here, I though you guys took off.
Yeah-yeah, it's down to me and two other guys.
Hey that's what all my relationships are like.
Hello!
Yeah!
Umm, yum!
Hey!
Then why do you throw like one?
Well, first it's not a purse.
You are my Everest.
More embarrassing than shiny raspberry lip balm?! I didn't say raspberry before did I? All right just-just tell me Rach, just tell me!
We figured we could be late because you guys were gonna be on time.
Oh...how much?
Did that guy really make that joke?
No.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, whoa. Do you ah, want to get her something speacial, get her flowers, get her candy, get her gum, girls love gum.
It just seems so futile, you know ? All these women, and nothing. I feel like Superman without my powers, you know? I have the cape, and yet I cannot fly.
When? Today? Some, not a lot.
Oh, really? You know what your great friend did? We're out to dinner, ok? We're getting along, having a really nice time. I was thinking she was really cool. And then, out of nowhere...
No, no, no, don't get up, I got a cooler right here.
Me! I'm up for puppets!
Hey, what's the horsepower on this thing?
But it is our apartment!
Oh, just er... you know, looking around. But you know what? This house... is great.
Okay, pick a card, any card. All right, now memorize it. Show to everybody. Got it?
Hey, Pheebs!
...is because they were friends first. Y'know? So I asked myself, "Who are my friends?" You and Phoebe, and I saw you first. So...
What?
All the time!
And I ah, borrowed some of your cologne. I hope she likes it.
Ohhh, here it comes.
Noo, more like a notebook... Damn it! Oh, if I'm building an house, the plan isn't called the 'shmoo-print'... Can't say that either? Woha... hey... In high school, I once had sex with a girl right in the middle of the...
Yeah! Y'know, she could use a little... Oh nice shot!!!
Hey. Man, it is so hard to shop for girls.
This is unbelievable Phoebs, how can you be married?
That's right baby.
No, inside good, outside bad.
I'm missin' picture time?!
Yeah, sure! Sure! They would uh, they would scrub the floors with it! They would use it to get the mud off their shoe. And sometimes underneath the horse would get dirty so they would stick it right...
Yes, all right? All of her hot dancer friends are gonna be there and they're gonna be, be drinkin' and dancin, and we really wanna go!
Thanks.
Yeah. So uh Ross, well now-why did that first marriage breakup? Was it because the woman was straight or she was a lesbian?
Okay! All right!
Yeah, y'know at first I thought we could talk about this y'know, work it out, but uh, seeing you two together I don't think I...
Face to face, yeah!
Yeah.
Ohh, I love birds.
Dude, chill! Okay, we also kissed in Barbados, but we didn't plan it, okay? And the only reason that that happened was because I saw you kissing Charlie.
Oh, hey, Chandler, we, ah, we stopped by the coffee shop and ran into Ross.
Look, Rachel, we don't have to do this.
Hello? What are you talking about? The audition's not 'til 5:00! Well, nobody told me! Who'd you talk to? Nevermind!
Yeah well next thing you know, he'll be telling you that your high heels are good for his posture!
G-sharp.
Okay, is there anything else?
Hey I got one! I got one!
Me too. In fact, I think I might be a little too comfortable.
Yeah. Why are you getting so upset?
Yeah! You don't like Kathy.
I know! I'm sorry! The guy's drunk, they won't let me go until we get this.
How good is that?
Hey, I was pretty close. Uhh, so bad news. Umm, I can't buy the boat, I don't have any money.
Eight hundred and twelve bucks.
Yeah, of course. I can control myself.
You guys promised you'd be more careful! I mean, come on! The good Joey name is being dragged through the mud here!
So you need someone who knows fashion, to tell you what looks good.
hot not hot Hot!
Come on! Look just-just tell-let her know that you really want them to be there. Let's not forget, this is a woman that has sent you many lasagnas over the years.
You-you must choose Mr. Bing.
Yeah, so we just keep trying and trying until we... do it.
It's not my first time.
Ok, I got one, I got one. Uh, if he blows into one, does the other one get bigger?
All you want is a dingle, What you envy's a schwang, A thing through which you can tinkle, Or play with, or simply let hang...
All right, relax. It's just a shoe.
Psss, that is whack!
My whole family's from Naples!
Put it on.
Hey, how was your chef thing?
In the woods. No wait-wait, that's the joke answer.
Man, do you know what guys want!
That's weird!
Hey, I'm not that fond of you either, ok buddy? But I'm just trying to be nice for the kids!
God, I just, I hate her! I hate her!! With her, 'Oh, I'm so talented.' and 'Oh, I'm so pretty,' and 'Ooh, I smell so good.'
That'll be $3.85.
Uh, I get Leslie out of the coma and then we make out.
Yeah, see... you were all worried for nothing.
What, like there's a rule or something?
Feel better now?
I got fired.
Chandler?
Look, the point is, there's a lot of women out there you haven't even had sex with yet!
What?!
Wow! Yeah I ah, I gave up a job too.
All right. I can't see.
It's a name, yeah. I saw you, you know, in this great house with a big pool.
Chandler? Forty-five minutes? Well, something is not right. I just can't believe he would do this to Monica!
Hey.
Hey!
I'll kick that door in if you give me a little sugar.
Hey! A dog! Hi! Who, you got to admit, looks a lot like Jane.
All right! Everybody ready to go to the movies?
Hey!
Okay, you watch too much TV.
Kinda looks like that stuff you get when you get a bad infection.
Yeah. You know? You just... Look, you gotta... You gotta think about last night the way she does, okay? Maybe, maybe sleeping together was the perfect way to say goodbye?
What?! Tonight?!
Oh, hey! Joey Tribbiani.
Man, this is gonna be kinda weird.
You sure? Some extra crispy? Dirty rice? Beans?
Look, I'm sorry I didn't tell ya. I'm sorry man.
Uh no, not really. It's an independent film y'know? So we don't have a real big budget. I figured I'd just stay in your room.
Oh, have either one of you guys ever been to the Rainbow Room? Is it real expensive?
Well, I said that I...
I like that! Oh, okay! Show him your bra! He's afraid of bras! Can't work 'em!
Nice!
Whoa.
Oh sorry, I hear divorce I immediately go to Ross. Who-who's Barry and Mindy?
Just... seeing what it'd be like to be a paleontologist... it's fun, yeah!
So Pheebs, where are you doing all, your bell ringing?
Can you believe this? Al Pacino! This guy's the reason I became an actor! "I'm out of order? Pfeeeh. You're out of order! This whole courtroom's out of order!"
I got one. Which one of us do you think will be the last to get married?
Hey, how you doin'?
Wow!
Yeah, I mean it's never taken me a week to get over a relationship.
I don't wanna.
Uh, it's 2:30 in the morning!
Oh yeah, lava spewing, hot ash, of course some are dormant.
The Ross-Is that back?!!
You usually find them on the 'heaving beasts'.
Never hit a woman. Never hit a woman.
Ahh, to be 13 again.
Hey bear, I need some career advice.
Hey, no way, that rooster's family!
Thanks man. Did you hear that, you guys? You're gonna get to stay here! And, and it's good, you know, 'cause, 'cause now you have a reason to come visit.
Yeah! You gotta tell a girl before you tape her. Such a rookie mistake.
He seemed like a stand up guy. Oh, and he's not into anything weird sexually.
Ah, are you okay?
Ooh...I hear that's bad.
I don't know why you just don't say left.
Yeah, three days on the lake without a shower. Plus! I fell in that big tub of worms at the bait stand! Hey, how-how's he doing?
Don't worry about that man, that happens.
Here's a little tip, she really likes it when you rub her neck in the same spot over and over and over again until it starts to get a little red.
Oh come on Ross! Hey Ross-Ross don't...
Why?
Hello?
I'm coming up!
Come on, I need your help here.
I am telling you Ross, she is definitely gonna fall in love with you again! Now, is that what you want?
Oh my, oh my God!
Pheebs, you gotta stop this, I working on commission here.
Great! Go get him.
I guess I'm going to have to come up with a really good reason why I wasn't there. The producers are going to be so mad at me. They sat us all down yesterday and said "Everyone has to be there at 6:00 AM sharp, that means you Tribbiani." Like.. like I was some kind of idiot.
Hey, if anybody gets extra tickets, it should be me! This all thing was my idea!
Oh what then? Kick me?
Je depli mblue.
Women are mean!!!
What?! All right-Hey! Don't look at me! You're the one who wanted to come up and look for some stupid Burger King comet!
All right now remember, something this big and long is going to be difficult to manuver, fortunately I have a lot of experience in that area.
Hey you guys, this is my agent, Estelle.
Oh, you want something serious. Y'know what you should do, you should get her one of those um, barium enemas. Those are dead serious.
Who cares? You're Rachel! Who's Kip?
That's what this is about! Oh my God, you hate Ross!
Peanut butter!
Relax. You're only at nine centimeters. And the baby's at zero station.
That's not food...No, I don't, no... Everything's different here...I want to go home. I...I miss my family. I miss the coffee house. I can't even remember what Phoebe looks like.
And you feel like we hold you back.
Thanks, yeah. I love this but ya know what, it makes me wanna pee.
I don't know Ross! I-I tell you what, let's flip to see who does it, okay? You-you call it in the air, all right?
aaand SEND! Opening credits.
What?
So...I've never played that!
What is Rock 'n' Roll about that?
Yeah, lady, I do! I got a problem with that!
The ones that got me the Porsche! Will you keep up! But I figured, if-if people keep seeing me just standing there, they're gonna start to think that I don't own it. So I figured I'll wash it. Right? Monica, you got a bucket and some soap I can borrow?
Yeah, just a crush! That's all this is! It's a crush! I'm Joey; I don't get deep feelings.
I know! I know! And I'm going to talk to them about it. They mean so much to me. They... They're like my family. If you guys are gonna be fighting all the time, I-I... I don't think we can be together. It just, it just can't work. It can't. I'm very upset.
Sure, yeah. I don't have time to say thank you because I really gotta go.
Oh, no. Ah, I playing your husband, Victor. I'm Joey Tribianni.
C'mon, Ross!
It's a pleasure to meet you Ray.
Would fall off a lot.
So uh, how you doin'?
Aww, Rach, I think you look cute And you, uh, you, you I could eat with a spoon .
What'd I tell you? What'd I tell you?
Nothing! Well, I-I got this blinding pain in my stomach when I was lifting weights before, then I uh passed out and uh, haven't been able to stand up since. But um, I don't think it's anything serious.
I know it could be intimidating for regular people to be around celebrities but... relax, I'm just like you! Only better looking and richer.
Yeah, yeah he is.
There's my scene, there's my scene. "Mrs. Wallace, I'm Dr. Drake Ramoray, your sister's neurosurgeon. I'm afraid the situation is much worse than we expected. Your sister is suffering from a..."
Hey-hey-hey you made it!
How do you know about that story?!
I think were not wearing the same shirt anymore!!
It's not that bad.
You damn right I am, I've been waiting for a cookie for 7 minutes.
I would sooner die in this hellhole then see her back with you!
Power saw kinda got away from me there.
Take it easy. If it means that much to you, I'll uh, I'll go find something else.
Yeah that really calms me down. And! We have so much in common! She loves sandwiches, sports, although she is a Met fan, not much of an issue now but if were ever to have kids, well that's a...
Why isn't that valet back with my Porsche?
This is for my boat, pretty cool huh?
Oh! Tell her she's not marriage material.
Wh-wh-what's going on? Wh-what's this about L.A.?
Bye.
Done!
Why, just a tiny little...
Okay, I'm in my sweat pants. Bring on the food! What's the matter?
Yaaaay!
Yes.
Oh man. Please tell me one of 'em is Ma.
Oh Rachel look, don't say that, I think you just need a hug from Joey. Come on. Come on. She's back! Hot girl's back!
We're geniuses! Yeah, look at them, look at them, they're really bonding.
What?! He got to do it at your first wedding!
But hey, listen just so you know, you might have you're work cut out for you. 'Cause when I talked to her, I kinda got the feeling that she's into some other guy. So...
Hi! How are the Gellers?
Oh, I know it... It is amazing these little things open doors... huh!
No, sorry haven't seen him.
I wanna rock and roll all night!
Hey-hey-hey-hey, I can help you decide who should do it! Yeah, we could have like uh, like an audition and see how you'd handle maid of honor type situations.
Probably not. Nah. I don't know how much I'm gonna wanna play after you go.
Funny one! That's good!
What?
Wow, I've admired your work for years. You-you've done some really amazing stuff.
Well, you should've told me that before, I'm not a mind reader. Hey, we're out of beer. I'm going to Monica's.
Okay listen, how are you gonna ask her?
Sorry! Sorry, I'm late; sorry, I'm late! My duck and my chick and a fight, it-it was ugly.
Oh yeah? All right, let's do it tonight.
All right Phoebs, way to go.
Well, that's gonna be tough Mon. I mean it's hard for me to be around an attractive woman and not flirt.
See ya tomorrow!
Oh. Are you sure you don't want to come? Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan, they get mail and stuff.
But I got to act with a robot Pheebs, and-and I don't know anything about technology! I can't even use Chandler's computer except to find porn! And-and that's only 'cause it's right there when you turn it on!
Uh, yeah, okay. Except I sorta felt like I needed a couple of seconds to get ready.
Like what?
I can give it a shot.
Oh? Oh! Okay! Okay! Let's hear their plan! Now, what's the future look like for Dina and Bobby?
All right. It's a new day, and it's just a crush, that's all! Just a little crush! All that worrying I was doing, that was crazy. Crazy! Like my friend here the bird would say, "it was cuckoo!" Everything's going to be fine. It's just a crush.
Yeah.
See look, women, carrying the bag. But it is odd how a women's purse looks good on me, a man.
What? No, no, no! No, no... no... no, no... No, too much is changing, okay? First, Phoebe getting married Congratulations! ... and then these two move into a stupid house in the stupid suburbs...
Terrible! I messed up every line! I shouldn't even be an actor!
Come on, Ross, that didn't mean anything! She just had the baby, she was all freaked out about doing it alone, she would have said yes to anybody.
I can't decide which route to take to Vegas. Hey, you've traveled a lot right?
U-U-Um, I think there's been an oversight.
So the Porsche guy took his car back.
Hey!
Well, he's with Charlie now.
I don't know, I just always pictured you ending up with one of those tall, smart blond guys, name like.... Hoyt.
Maybe, maybe we did a good thing, helping Ross get back on his feet!
Whoa, whoa. And the fact that you dumped him because he hit on Phoebe?
There was chocolate on the three. It looked like an eight, alright?
Oh. Why would you scare me like that? What the hell is going on? Is somebody pregnant?
Dude! Hernia operations cost like, a lot probably. Besides it's getting darker and more painful, that means it's healing.
No.
Hey! I do too think about the consequences of my decisions! What gives you the right to... Go to hell! Stupid guy on my phone.
You can't just give up! Is that what a dinosaur would do?
And I gotta go sell some Christmas trees.
Look we've got to find her. Phoebe just called!! Rachel's coming to tell Ross she loves him!!
You know what the Celtics problem is? They let the players run the team.
Well, maybe I can help.
Oh yeah, it must be tough to keep your hands of him, huh?
Hey!
When have I ever done that?!
Oh mama! Uh when-when is the baby due?
God. He's crazy! Why doesn't he want to be with Rachel?
Hey.
Hey little buddy, how are you feeling? What the hell is in that face cream? That's so soft. Pillowcases! Zelda looked at the chimney sweep. Her father, the vicar... The vicar? ...wouldn't be home for hours. Her loins were burning. She threw caution to the wind and reached out and grabbed his... Whoa! Whoa-ho-ho-ho! This is a dirty book!
We were gonna go see the Jets!
Hello?
Whoa-whoa, Treeger made you cry?
Okay uh, look I know you're a great actor, okay? And you play all those Shakespeare guys and stuff...
Hey, I think Emma might like it!
Oh yeah, sorry about that. Mob mentality or whatever, I don't know...
Actually, that will be long. You know, I really need to organize my thoughts.
Whoa-whoa-whoa. What ah, what happened to playing the field?
Right. Ok, ok, uh, ducks is heads, because ducks have heads.
Uh-huh! I know. I'm coming soon to a theater near you! I'm in THX! I'm unsuitable for children!
It's gonna be worth it. It's a known fact that women love babies, all righ? Women love guys who love babies. It's that whole sensitive thing. Quick, aim him at that pack o' babes over there. Maybe one of them will break away. No, no wait, for get them, we got one, hard left. All right, gimme the baby.
That's your move? Boy Rach, you're lucky you're hot.
I knew that! I sooo didn't know that, but you should see your faces.
Thank you.
All right. Chandler, do you remember how I told you about our fridge?
Me neither, y'know what-
That's a great story-can I eat it?
Mine!
Hey.
But what if uh-and I'm not saying she will be-But...
Well, I think we all learned something.
But that's what...
What?
Okay!
No.
You were amazing, could you just do me this huge favor, you see there's this one other audition that I really, really want, and Estelle couldn't get me in.
North route!
Come on, please, it'll be just this one more, well actually it's two.
Hey.
Yeah. And look, I just want you to know that with Rachel staying here and everything, all my feelings from before are totally over, okay? And even if they weren't, when you accidentally walk in on a woman using a breast pump...
Well my old man is doing a plumbing job down there and he heard they have an opening. So, you want me to see if I can get you an interview?
That doesn't sound like thinking to me!
Well, it comes and goes. I wouldn't trust it.
What's the matter, Pheebs?
Dude, come on! French it u-up!
Some guy!!
Hi.
Sure.
I know, right? Wh... Wh... Why are we doing this?
no... hmmmmm... it's not... hmmmmmmmmmm.
Hey.
Y'know, when we talked about face to face, I don't think we thought it all the way through.
Yeah?
Well, it's good thing you got out when you did, before she blew up like that Vesuvius.
Nope. Op, wait! There he goes.
I should know that. Let's see, just one moment please. Umm, here we are, a Wicked Wango card determines whether you go higher or lower.
Y'know I blame Ross for this.
Oh, you have no idea. And-and when we're on stage I get to-to kiss her and-and touch her, but then she goes home with the director, and it's like somebody's ripping out my heart!
Check it out, check it out. Heckles' high school yearbook.
Oh my... How much do you weigh Ross?!
Man, hell of a two weeks, huh? Y'know what, though? I really feel like I learned something.
B-bye Janice. So when ya' dumpin' her.
I couldn't. He was saying all these really nice things about me. I didn't want him to get mad and take 'em all back. I'm on a edge on Chandler.
Yeah.
Y'know, we don't have to imagine.
Y'know what? Make fun all you want. This is a great bag! Okay? And it's as handy as it is becoming. Now, just because you don't understand something, doesn't make it wrong. All right? So from now on you guys are gonna have to get used to the fact that Joey, comes with a bag!
Nothing, he's just really believes in that.
Are you kidding me?! She's gonna this boat!
Thursday? But that's Halloween.
Yeah well, I'm guessing after this she's not going to be crazy about electricity either.
Shut up!
They know you know.
Yeah, what's that about?
You think?
Chandler, will you just come in already?
Ross..
Maybe you could take Charlie shopping.
oh why don't you fly out there and surprise him.
Is he still mad at us?
That guy's still doing that?!
Uh, sit down. I wanna talk about our situation.
No they're not! They're ugly and stupid and delicious!
It's Joey.
Wow! I can't believe this! This is incredible. I mean you just won an Oscar!
Ohh, well, that's ok then. But, okay my towels for instance. I come in to the bathroom here and my towel is not on the floor where keep it. It's up here on some hook..and...smells different.
We've only been going out for a couple of weeks, do you think I gotta get her something?
I don't know. Why? Did you hear something?
Yeah...
Gladys?
Pizza, heh, its not like I never had that before...ba dum bum cheshhh.
Uh-oh.
So you're really doing this, huh?
Oh yeah, that's just a little something for my huge gay fan base.
Oh uh, hey Pheebs. Uh y'know what? I'll-I'll come back later.
Oh yeah.
Baby shower. Wow! That sounds sooo like something I don't want to do! Later!
Yes you are!
You are? Ross, I'm sorry..
Three tickets to today's Rangers game!!
I was making a peanut butter smoothy, right?
Glow-pop giggly jammer.
Try it, I can't feel a thing!
Why don't you ask Chandler, 'cause he's the one that fooled around with her. She told me you said you could really fall for her. Now is that true? Or are you just gettin' over Janice by groping my sister.
No-no, I don't really have any money. Not yet, anyway...
Chandler.
No way! Look, Halloween is so stupid! Dressing up, pretending to be someone you're not...
Hi, yeah, it's me. Oh, no no no, we're just friends. Yeah, I'm single. 25. An actor. Hello?
It's not just the stuff he paid for, I mean it's-it's everything. Y'know? He read lines with me. He-he went with me on auditions when I was really nervous, and then he consoled me after I didn't get parts that I really wanted. You always believed in me man. Even, even when I didn't believe in myself.
Tell me about it, I feel like I'm holding down the fort all by myself.
And the best part is, we're filming in the desert outside Vegas! And you know what that means buddy!
The Ice Capades?
Fungus! Yeah. Place is full of it.
Hey.
Hey Pheebs! Listen, uh can you do me a favor? I forgot the pin number to my ATM card can, can you get it for me?
Man this is weird. You ever realize Captain Crunch's eyebrows are actually on his hat?
Wouldn't she?
Oh, Monica and Chandler's recommendation. I want it to sound smart but.. I don't know any big words or anything, so...
All right.
How could this happen to me?! Yesterday I had two TV shows! Today, I got nothin'!
Morning!
How is it you?
Well okay, so then you're fine. The rule is when two actors are actually doing it off-stage all the sexual tension between them is gone. Okay? So as long as it's hot onstage you got nothing to worry about. It's when the heat goes away, that's when you're in trouble.
Yeah.
Will you let the lady talk?!
Yeah but it's too much stuff. You know like, you got the candles and the foofy schmoofer thing here and over here you got a picture of a watering can.
Mine's is to Lilian Myers.
What award are you practicing for?
Maybe we shouldn't pay our gas bill?
Hey, it's not the first time I lost a girl to a cowboy spraying cologne. Bijan for men? Bijan for men?!
Hey uh, is it okay to come in?
All right, I'm here, let's ahh, get this over with.
Yes!
Yeah.
Rach! Rachel! Okay, the next highest bidder is at table one.
Yeah, sure. Well, you must be new here. Maybe we should-I'm sorry, can I ask you something?
Okay. Phoebe Thank you. Thank you!
Mmmm hmm! For your boob job!
...Does the knuckle-cracking bother everybody?
Gimme a box a juice. Well, they switched me over to Hombre.
Way to go robot!
Well uh...I think I want to take Chandler.
Why can't I find that?
Thanks. Thanks, but uh actually it's just gonna be me again tonight.
I do it every year.
Pheebs, who's Evelyn Dermer?
Right!"Oh my God, is this the men's room? Oh, I feel so foolish, have you always known you wanted to be an actor?"
Okay, bye.

What am I going to do? You know, and I keep, I keep trying to get rid of these feelings, y'know? I stayed up all last night and made a list of everything I don't like about her. You want to hear it?
What? I have seven Catholic sisters. I've taken care of hundreds of kids. Come on, we wanna do it, don't we?
Wait, wait, we have a copy of your key.
Now-now, listen this is just a first draft so... "We are gathered here today on this joyous occasion to celebrate the special love that Monica and Chandler share." Eh? "It is a love based on giving and receiving. As well as having and sharing. And the love that they give and have is shared and received. And through this having and giving and sharing and receiving." "We too can share and love and have and receive."
Pheebs!
Probably wanna know what I'm doing...?
No! No. Don't do that, just next time make sure she really likes me.
We love you, man.
All right, I'll take care of it.
Here we go! Here we go!
Hey I was crying because, because nobody believed Quincy's theory. Okay?
Oh, well think of it like this, when you're 90...
Okay.
What a phony.
Hey!
Oh my God!
No, but I hear lyme disease is open, so...
Look, it's okay, no, no, no, really, look um, I really appreciate this Pheebs, but I think I'm gonna have to go back to Estelle.
I, um, can't tell you.
What? I...I just figured since you're pregnant you're not gonna be seeing people.
Sure. Coffee? 'Cause I'm going up there.
The fridge broke. I have to eat everything. Cold cuts, ice cream, limes-Hey, what was in that brown jar?
Well, I get the medical award for separating the siamese twins. Then Amber and I go to Venezuela to meet our other half-brother, Ramone. And that's where I find the world's biggest emerald. It's really big but it's cursed.
Come on Treeger, don't say that. You just ahh, you just need more practice. Here, come on, let's ahh, let's try it again. Come on. Plus, it was, it was probably mostly my fault, anyway. I mean, y'know, I'm not really that comfortable dancing with a- We-he!! Hey!
3, 2,
Oh my god.
For one thing, the guy on the tape said I was doing a good job!
You don't think my mom's sexy?
Her what?
Allright, fine, I only have one thought! It's about the hot nanny, I gotta see her!
Come on! You're good with kids. They're just crazy on Halloween. Y'know, they're all greedy and hopped up on sugar!
Cute! This is Janice! You remember Janice?
I know I'm having the worst time. There was a 15-minute line for the buffet, and when I finally got up to the plates, I slipped on a giant booger!
Y'know I don't think you should be talking at all in there! I think you've got to much thinking to do to be talking and making jokes!
Y'know, I can see why you think that, but ah, actually, you know who I think it is?
I'm sorry. I'm 28 years old, I've never lived alone, and I'm finally at a place where I've got enough money that I don't need a roommate anymore.
Look, Ross, I feel really bad. I mean, you're going through all this stuff and I just acted like a jerk.
No no, uh, don't thank me for comin' in. Uh, at least let me finish. Uh, we could take the expressway but uh, this time of day you're better off taking the budge. You were goin' for the word bridge there weren't ya. I'll have a good day.
Look, Pheebs, I just, I wanna apologize for, for saying that your method was stupid and-and maybe ask you to be my teacher again. And-and I promise, I won't touch a guitar until you say I'm ready. You really think I'm ready?
Yeah! That guy's all right!
Yep.
Nana?
Oh, come on! Last night I was finishing off a pizza and she said "Uoh oh oh, a moment on the lips, forever on the hips!" I don't need that kind of talk in my house!
Alright now listen, you guys, we talked about it, and if you don't want to play, we completely understand.
Oh, you guys, with this joke. I gotta say, I know I cracked up, but I'm not even sure I got it.
Oh, hey listen! The Soapie's called today and I also get to present an award.
Done!
I can't believe you guys are moving.
Well if you can't talk dirty to me, how're you going to talk dirty to her? Now tell me you want to caress my butt!
My friend Rachel has a kid. I totally know nursery rhymes!
Look, you and I have been given a gift. Okay? We have to do something with it. Like-like, hand modeling! Huh? Or-or magic! And you know NASA's gonna wanna talk to us!
Yeah right after we stole his lunch money and gave him a wedgie. What's the matter with you, he's parking the car.
Hello New York!
Check.
Yeah, it seemed pretty important.
Je de coup Clow.
What?!
Well, that was only 'cause I used the red one to unclog the drain.
Hey, Monica, wow you've been in the bathroom for like a half-hour.
Hey!
I like that! Oh, okay! Show him your bra! He's afraid of bras! Can't work 'em!
Such as?
Look, I'll get new headshot taken, all right, so I want to get my eyebrows shaped.
Uh, eleven, eleven and a half.
We did?
Oh hey Rach, listen-Hi!
He's the same! .
Ha, oh, of course.
You sure?!
Uhh, well I've got an audition down the street and I spilled sauce all over the front of my shirt. You got an extra one?
Hey, I'm with you. He even asked me if I thought you'd go out with him.
All right! Hey, who wants pizza?!
I dunno what to say, Ross. Uh, it's a monkey.
Hello? Oh hey! Can you, can you hang on a second? It's the producers over at Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E. can you excuse me for a minute? Hey, funny you should call. I was just looking over next week's script. Canceled?! Like they're taking it off the air? Ohh. All right, see you Monday. We're not even shootin' them anymore?!! All right, bye! They canceled Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E!
I kn-I know! I know! Okay? And apparently tomorrow when I go in to meet the director I have to take off my clothes so that they can see what my body looks like.
Look, Chandler, I told you, never tell anyone about this dog thing. It's like Ross not likin' ice cream.
A little salami.
Can I ask you something?
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!! None of that, not while you're living under my roof!
Oh, you're not taking her with you tonight?
Yeah, was there a part of you that... felt like it was... really wrong?
This is clearly in the wrong apartment.
Pickle? Pickles make her sick. Giving her pickles is like giving me salad.
Oh-oh, hey-hey, Kate! Listen I want you to meet everybody. Everybody, this is Kate.
Yes! Guess who's in an audition for a Broadway musical?
I didn't get it.
Hey, why can't we use the same toothbrush, but we can use the same soap?
Ah.
Come on man, just-just let the girls stay, I'll do whatever you want.

Right, of course. Hey, did you guys finish the speech?
I mean naked game. Strip poker, we should totally play strip poker.
Yeah! Allright! Hey, hey Ross. Check it out! Sandy taught me Hot-cross Buns.
I tried to call you from the coffee shop, and there was no answer.
Heh, what d'ya say?
Wow! Uh okay, well uh...
What are you doing?
Well... I'm helping out down at the N.Y.U. Med School with some... research.
Oh that's mine too! I'm Italian!
What?! Are you crazy?!
I can't believe you didn't know it was a line!
Yeah?
No! Not unless! Look this must end now!
Oh, it was a lot of fun right up until Chandler got a finger in the eye!
Uh yes, but it was, we just did it once uh, in London.
A little more.
Yeah, well, I still got a week left to go in the program, and according to the rules, if I want to get the money I'm not allowed to conduct any... ersonal experiments, if you know what I mean.
But it's an original Buffay...
Ok.
It's Rachel.
Y'know what? I think that's enough for today. Thanks for your help!
Arghhh! Double standards!
What the hell am I supposed to do!
Unless what?
You're Rachel!
Oh. Well good! For me. What is this? Did you give yourself a facial?
See, there was kind of a mix up in my agent's office, but I'm still on TV and that's good exposure.
You guys hear a ringing?
Huh? Uh...
Six months? Whoa that's rough.
I guess you wouldn't believe me if I said I was Kurt Douglas, huh?
Yeah?
One.
Hey Pheebs, I'm so sorry.
No-no, this only took five minutes. I spent the rest of the day coming up with new, Ultimate Fireball. Ha-ha!
I know. Ross is getting married.
Who cares?! I-I'll make payments, whatever it takes, I want the Mr. Bowmont!!
Here's how I know you didn't watch the tape, ok? If you had seen what was on this tape, believe me, you would have some comments. Alright, now remember, I got paid a lot of money for this and it only aired in Japan.
I know. I know. And she's not only my friend; she's my pregnant friend! She's my pregnant friend who's Ross' ex!
Yes!
No, my first fan mail.
I do not.
Like a goalie, right?
Uh, ah, Monica's pregnant?!
Nice to meet ya!
Pheebs?
Alan.
No. It just seems like Ross is the kind of a guy that would marry a woman on the verge of being a lesbian and then push her over the edge.
Hey, Rach, how you doing with The Shining?
A hamster? What, those things are like 10 bucks.
Woah. Why do you get to keep the table?
Hey Rach.
Oh whoa-whoa-whoa, no roommate stuff. Okay? We're on a date.
Yeah, well, I couldn't find any cards, so it was either this or Strip Bag Of Old Knitting Stuff.
You can pee here!
Okay well, I was down on one knee with the ring in my hand.
Hey so where's Ross?
See, this is a great apartment.
You're gonna have to pee on it.
That's a good call. Right.
Damnit woman we're losing precious time! Now do you want this man's blood on your head?
Why?
Thanks, man. And oh, while you're at it, could you get her a card?
You're in!
Well that's it. I'm done. Whew! There come the meat sweats.
Oh-oh, yeah-yeah, I bet all the sex makes it easier!
Wait up!
Hey.
What? Are you out of your mind? Lets throw some jello on them.
So? Who would you rather have kiss you, me or Chandler?
I don't know uhh... Well, I'm Joey. Yeah, I'm disgusting, I take my underwear off in other people's homes.
What the hell is in there?
You're getting a cat?
Look at that, Charlton Heston eating a liquorice whip!
You and me, next dance?
Which one, they all suck!
Wow.
Oh my.
Oh that's too bad. I've kinda been saving up. Uh, are you sure there's no studies I can participate in?
But, but wh-what about us?
Uh, don't you mean "for whom?"
Maybe I could give thanks for you shuttin' up, eh?
Oh yeah, that was a pretty good night.
You a little sad about that sweetheart?
Why?
Son of a bitch!
"I, oh, I can't. I want to, but I can't!"
Oh! yeah!
Yeah! Okay! Hey! Hi!
Where?
Wouldn't you pay good money to see these identical hands showcased in some type of a uh, entertainment venue?
I had to read the Bible pretty carefully, but... yeah we do.
What do you mean?
Oh, de fuff!
Nah, just me. All alone. Dinner for six for one, uh, you boys are about to see something really special.
You?! And-and you?!
Uh, does it hurt?
Why would I want another apartment, huh? I've already got an apartment that I love.
Hey! You made it!
And the winner is...Joey Tribbiani! Oh... Wow! I honestly never expected this. I uh, I didn't prepare a speech. But umm, I'd like to thank my parents, who've always been there for me. I'd also like to thank my friends, Chandler, Monica, Phoebe, Rachel...
Ooh, we could end up with nothing.
Not in my head.
Yeah!! I call that London style.
Yeah.
Hey Monica it's Joey. Listen uh, Phoebe and I smell gas comin' from your apartment.
Oh, hey, you guys are finally gonna get to meet Kate!
I don't know. She's got to be taking it hard, I was like her only client. Except for this guy who eats paper. And I'm guessing he eats more money than he makes. Look, I know she's not a great agent, but she did stick with me for ten years. I'm gonna call her and hire her again.
Oh that's nice. Happy birthday Rachel, here's some goo.
Yeah? That's so nice!
Oh.
Yes!!
Hey! You guys! Check it out, check it out! Guess which job I got.
Somebody was using his head. Hey, let's check out the rest of the place.
Well uh, she didn't want to hang out with you guys two nights in a row. I'm so sorry.
Uh, aren't we kind of in the middle of something here?
You got married to fast.
But Phoebe, wait! Wait! Phoebe. Phoebe!
Hey, I don't need violence to enjoy a movie. Just so long as there's a little nudity.
Yeah? Well, I don't want to talk to you Wayne! I hate you! You ruined my life! Oh, Chandler, Wayne. Wayne, Chandler.
A little tall.
What? No! No Ross! No-no! Stop! I'm not jumping! Okay, look I have an audition tomorrow and I can't go if I break my leg.
Okay look, Chandler, if this you have got to listen! You're gonna throw that juice at me, aren't ya?
Come on you guys, we want you to know we're very very sorry. Right guys?
Why would you want to do that?
Soldier down!
Hey! Are you okay?
Hey, y'know you could always visit him.
All right.
No-o-o!!
What?! Wait-wait-wait! The handsome man was about to enter!!
Dah!!
No!
Me too.
Pretty much, yeah.
Yeah.
Cat.
I know; that just pushes them further and further apart.
It does in mine!
Judge rules, Nutter-Butter.
Yes. It's just that she's so much smarter than all the girls I've ever dated! Combined! I don't want her to think I'm stupid!
Hey! Sleeping beauty!
Yeah, okay.
We just got the message.
So anyway, I'm trying to get my boss's ex-wife to sleep with me. . .
Ohh, you know what it is? It's smudgy 'cause they're fax pages. Now when I was on Days of Our Lives as Dr. Drake Remoray, they'd send over the whole script on real paper and everything.
Hey, who wants to ah, throw the ball around a little, maybe get a little three on three going?
Yeah!
Okay, if you say so. All right, ready? Set! Go!
Come on in, how are ya?
Yeah. Uh, ...a slice......six dollars?
That's great, but isn't it gonna bother that people still think you're a porn star?
Maybe we should check the trash chute.
So Pheebs, do they know about each other?
Oh my God! Oh! Hey, can I have an aquarium? And a sex swing?
Yeah!
Hey! Here's the birthday boy! Ross, check it out: hockey tickets, Rangers-Penguins, tonight at the Garden, and we're taking you.
Yeah, I know, I sleep in the next room.
All right Chandler, you're up.
Well, he's gonna. I'll see you a little later, ok? Hey, how ya doin'?
HEY! I never have an off night ok although sometimes when I'm a little bloated I don't feel very sexy BUT EVEN THEN I'M BETTER THEN MOST!
Oh anyway, I just wanted to say how wonderful I think you are.
What's up?
If you ask me, as long as you got this job, you've got nothing pushing you to get another one. You need the fear.
Hey.
Aww. Ohh!
All right. Don't look at my list, Ross, 'cause there's a lot on there that you don't have.
I'm on top of the world, looking down on creation and the only explanation I can find, is the wonders I've found ever since...
Hey. I spent the night out. I met this cute bridesmaid. She is so...
And what?! Did you sleep with her?!
Feminist issue. That's where I went!
Oh yeah.
But you said one.
Hey.
Look, I'll come to the party but I'm not dressing up.
I can't! Y'know? You guys don't know what it's like to put yourself out there like that and just get shot down.
Huh, un, blu, bla, flu, flenk!
Okay! Look-look-look, uh, if you're gonna be moving in with him I feel it's my responsibility to tell you the truth about him! Okay? He's a terrible roommate! Terrible! He uh, forgets to umm... Oh-oh he always, he always umm-Oh, who am I kidding! He's the best roommate ever!
That's great! Hey, can you cast me in it?
Uhh do you happen to have a hot girl in there?
No! No! No! No! No! How you doin'?! How you doin'-Damnit Carl! Go wait in the hall!
I hate Pottery Barn too. They kicked me out of there just because I sat on a bed!
I told ya.
Oh, now it's a spare room?
Yeah!!
Look I don't know this baby. I don't know if she's a famous artist or not. You know, and I don't want to be a jerk but you're changing too much around here.
How's that different? Oh! Yeah!
Hey!
Sure, yeah. Will you just keep an eye on the chick and the duck?
Of course it was a line!
No, no, you can't, you can't, okay, you can't, you can't buy her pearls, you just can't, you can't, you can't.
And that's just in the city. I get her up to 160 when I take her upstate.
Yeah, what are ya gonna do?
Bye-bye. I did it!
Chandler is a complex fellow, one who is unlikely to take a wife.
Monica. Oh... huh, I always thought it would be Rachel.
Oh, what are you gonna do? You're gonna fire me?
I don't know! I really want this part! And they tell you no matter what you get asked at an audition you say yes. Like if-if they want you to ride a horse, you tell 'em you can! And just figure out how to do it later.
I don't know. Who'm I'm married to?
Fuggetaboutit. How you doin?
Hey, this is ridiculous. I'll tell you what. After I get back from my neice's christening, I'll go down to the coffee house with you and we'll all have a nice cup of coffee alright. No problem, Joey's there.
Wow! That's pretty nice. I thought he cut off his ear 'cause he sucked. What else you got in there?
No.
Did I not just tell him?
Erica.
Hey!
Hey, so, uh, how's it going living over at Ross'?
Are you kiddin'? When they shoot you out of that cannon.
Hello?
Well, it looks like it wasn't heeled after all! Yeah! So, I guess this chair is mine now!
Well, who knew? Pharmacists are fun.
All right now, memorize it. You got it?
Oh, you know, the writing was good, and the director is good, and... and my co-star's good but they're not as good as me!
Yeah! Come on.
Ahh!
Hey guys!
What do you got there?
Guess what?
Pheebs come on! Bunny vs. Doody! We're waiting! Okay. Okay guys, one match, winner take all. Oh wait-wait! What does the winner get?
Yeah! Yeah, why? What's up?
Both of us?
Oh... Can you imagine if I hadn't left you that last one? You two might've never gotten together. Ooh-ooh! Could you imagine if I sent that hooker up to the room like I was gonna?! It's like it was in the stars!
Well, remember when they got in that big fight and broke up and we were all stuck in her with no food or anything? Well, when Ross said Rachel at the wedding, I figured it was gonna happen again, so I hid this in here.
Hey, is, is, is Chandler here?
All right! There is something. I kinda had a dream, but I don't want to talk about it.
Maybe we should just eat now.
You wanna see her again, right?
Eww! Look, I'm asking a favor here. If I do this for her brother, maybe Angela will come back to me.
Come on! Admit it! That was the best nap you ever had!
Hey Monica! People came to see a fight, let's give 'em what they came for!
Now he's movin'? Man, what is Emily doing to him? Ow!! He's not even here!!!
It's Ba-go-ta, but close enough. Now, you can either pass your turn to Ross or pick a Wicked Wango card.
They uh director. Uhh, her. All right, all right, it's not a gladiator movie. I work here.
No-no, things ah, finally happened with Kate.
What?
Monica just called from the cab. She said they should be here any minute. And apparently, there's some big surprise.
Well, the movie got shutdown because they ran out of money, so I'm working here 'til it starts up again, if it ever does.
Hey, y'know in Roman times this was more than just a hat.
'Cause it's always somethin', you know, like Monica's new job, or the whole Ross's birthday hoopla.
Okay, look...
Yeah! Because this commercial belongs to me and Mitch!
So I'm thinking, basically we pick it up and then we flip it.
You're kidding right?
Oh, I don't know Pheebs. It'll be okay.
All right, all right, all right, all right, all right, you really wanna know how I did it, I'll show ya. When you handed me back the card, what you didn't see was, I looked at it so fast that it was invisible to the naked eye. I just did it. I just did it, again. Here, I'll slow it down so that you guys can see it.
Give me a number, I don't want to owe you anything!
You wanna see what I got? Okay? I've got a baby Tootsie Roll, a movie stub, keys, a Kleenex, a rock, and an army man. Hey!
Ohh, I know one thing!
Hey!
I-I wasn't in that.
I was afraid of that.
Same kind of thing happened to me! Woman pizza delivery guy come over, gives me the pizza, takes the money, and leaves!
Oh uh, one of the writers.
No, no, Emma has one Hugsy, the new Hugsy, huh? The other Hugsy, I don't know, I guess I'll just take it back.
Oh I like this place. And technically, technically I'm not breaking any rules so I...
This is embarrassing.
I think I'm gonna cry!
Hey. Ross, I know you're pissed at me, but we have to talk about this.
One of the virus victims called in sick, so Cathy recommended me and boom, I'm dying on the gurney. Oh Ross, Marcel just finished his last scene if you want to go down there and say goodbye.
Yes! Didn't you ever read Sports Illustrated?! No! I didn't read yours! But come on, we can go to the game tonight!
And, a brownie! Well, half a brownie. Actually, it's just bag. It's been a long walk from the flower shop and I was startin' to feel faint so...
Hey, it hasn't come to that yet.
Where's all the tissues?!
Okay. Years ago, when I was backpacking across Western Europe...
Oh, y'know what? Maybe uh, you...you should come to me. I'm a not, I'm not wearing any bottoms.
Do you uh, do you-ready for a refill?
So but everything is normal.
OK, alright, the people who threw the water.
Yeah! All right? Let's go!
Wise choice, how many rungs?
NO! No-no-no-no-no-no! Hey! Hey, we'll be fine! Li... hey, like you said: no big deal!
I took a shot.
It's kind of embarrassing, y'know. I mean, I was an actor and now I'm a waiter. It's supposed to go in the other direction.
I could use a challenge! It's getting pretty easy.
Oh great, that'd be great. Thank you.
Judge rules, Nutter-Butter.
It's easy, you just walk in on them having sex.
I love that movie.
Come on you guys, one more time.
And what is his name?
Look, Chandler I don't think us getting our asses kicked is a solution. Okay? Just go and find Monica!
Hey, y'know what? I'll come too. I'm making money now; it's about time I give something back.
Hey, hey! You said you're gonna wear a thong, where's the thong?
Hi!
I know, it was amazing! I mean, we totally nailed it, it was beautiful.
Okay!
It's just I can't because my manager said I... "Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you. Happy birthday dear Annie...
I'm falling in love with you.
Well, there's really only one thing you can do.
It's the Knicks!
I want you to like her! But if that's too damned difficult for you, then the least you can do is pretend.
Oh man! I have to get those done too?!
Ooh, yeah, I'm not going anywhere for a while.
What?!! No I'm not!!
Okay. I got nominated for my part on Days of Our Lives!
Apparently he was this Russian dictator who slaughtered all these people. You'd think you would've known that!
Oh, Chandler.
Why, are you moving out?
Oh that's on the house courtesy of Joey Tribbiani.
What are they doing out here? The coast's all the way over there.
Oh, hey, hey, can I give you guys your house-warming present now?
Uh, four.
Yes! Whew!
The blizzard. I just saw on the news, it's like the worst snow storm in 20 years! They already closed all the bridges and tunnels.
That's great. Thanks Rach.
Oh, I didn't go to college.
Have you ever slept in the same bed as a monkey?!
There y'go, kids.
I-I-I don't know if this falls under this category, but uh, Ross is right back there.
Can't really say!
You're ready to have a baby? My boy's all grown up!
I can't believe Ross went out with Rachel's sister! When Chandler made out with my sister I was mad at him for 10 years.
Soon, soon, I'm gonna be on soon. There I am!
No. Rosita does not move.
Will you calm down, he's just a human guy.
Hey, can you close that window Chandler? My nipples can cut glass over here!
Like you wouldn't believe. Wow! This is a great place.
No, in Ross's building! She's back! She's back! Okay, wait there, I'll be over in a second. Got it!
Oh! I know how you can get him, take off your bra.
Whoa! Is this porn? What did I do? I must've hit something on the remote.
No, God, no! No! No no, I'm an actor. You'd probably recognize me from a little show called "The Days of Our Lives".
I know.
Oh! Oh-oh, you gotta pick Joey! I mean, name one famous person named Chandler.
All right, all right.
Well, I eat a lot of meat right?
Je te flouppe Fli.
I don't know, maybe I can't. I mean, maybe there's something wrong with me.
I don't know whether it's just 'cause we're breakin' up or... what, but you have never looked so beautiful.
Well, I'd like to think there was something for everyone. Look, I know you're casting for this new show...
All right, I'm gonna go say hi the chick and the duck.
No, I-I just heard lunch. But yeah, I can go. Sure!
Plus, y'know, I think it should be Joe. Y'know, Joey makes me sound like I'm, I dunno, this big. Which I'm not.
Hey, hey... I can convince people to do anything, you know. I bet I can even get Mike to do that "thing". What is it?
It's not my first time.
Yeah, yeah sure, goodnight.
Umm, y'know how the other day you were talking about how you didn't get to go to London and how you were kinda feeling left out?
Why would they take away our keys?
The stripper stole the ring!! The stripper stole the ring!! Chandler! Chandler, get up! Get up! The stripper stole the ring!
She's comin'.
Ooh! So close.
Hard to tell, I was naked.
Yeah, I saw her this morning walkin' it by the park.
Yeah?

Hey!
Oh wow! You can tell this soon.
Hmm, noodle soup.
This is what I've got going for the party so far, liquor wise. Get a lot of liquor.
I'm just mad at my agent.
Wow! Maybe uh, maybe you and I ought to get to know each other a little better.
All right, Jester man, look we wanna see the king.
Pheebs! Wait up! Listen uh, close your eyes. Maybe that's one thing you can cross off your list.
What do you mean?
Fortune! This guy is so stupid. It's Count Rushmore!!
No! No, I quit a long time ago. Did I forget to you that one? I'm sorry.
Oooooh!
What? What's wrong?
What? Why not? Rach, who can you not get?
Oh, they cut me out of the show.
I couldn't help it, there love is so pure.
Yeah. I am sorry he's not here too, but I got to say, I am really enjoying Nacho Chair.
I'm tellin' ya, he hasn't moved since this morning.
Yeah, I didn't know you guys were going to be here.
Of course!!
Oh you'll take 'em!
I thought we talked about this. I don't like pulp. No pulp. Pulp isn't juice. All juice, okay?
No-no-no-no look no! I won't spit, and I won't stare at Monica's breasts! Y'know? Everyone knows I'm an ass man!
Come on! It'll be fun! Me, you, and Ross, and... Paul probably...
They're so small!
Yeah! But if would've know what kind of friend you were gonna turn out to be, I wouldn't have worried about it so much! See you around!
Well, maybe a little. I wish you hadn't seen me throw up.
Not as upset as he's gonna be when he finds out what I did with his sweater vests!
Hey, you're back too!
Well, so anyway Beth, what I'm saying is I should've considered your feelings before I went home with you that night. I've ah, I've recently learned what's it like to be on your side of it, and I'm sorry. So, do you think you can forgive me? Great. Thanks. Okay, bye. Hello, Jennifer? Oh hi, Mrs. Loreo, is Jennifer there? Oh, she's not home huh? Well ah, actually I kinda need to talk to you too.
Well, you suck! But at least you suck at a man's game now.
Did you see the size of the closets?!
Hey, hey, look! It's not about a few fries... it's about what the fries represent.
I'm so happy!
Whoa-whoa you guys, it's not a cat!
Get out of the corner. Pass it, pass it.
Why don't I take you out?
Listen, I ah, went to that restaurant that you were talking about last week...
Two brothers, one died!
Hey guys!
Stop callin'!!
Hm-mm! Yeah nice necklace!
Ohh great!!!
Absolutely. But, we're gonna stop by the hospital just to be sure, okay? I'll page Ross on the way. Come on.
Yeah. I realized it about a half-hour ago but I didn't want to say anything 'cause I didn't want to jinx it.
Everything is upside down here! It rains all day long, nobody watches tv and Ross is famous!
Hey!
Oh what, did someone outbid you for the teapot? Oh! Secret teapot?
That's kinda nice.
Oh, yeah, yeah, listen for it.
Oh it's water under the bridge, forget it!
What's not to like? Custard? Good. Jam? Good. Meat? Gooooood.
No-no, Kathy.
Well, let me ask you something, was Kip a better roommate than me?
But over the past few weeks...
Uh Rach, if you're gonna start another story, at least let me finish mine.
Oh, yeah. He's got that great baby smell. Get a whiff of his head.
It will be when you look like that in a tight skirt! This is great! I'm getting more dates than ever!
I can't believe I'm going to lose this job!
Oh my God.
Oh well, Chandler and Monica are over there and it's kinda hard to concentrate.
They're takin all my stuff back. I guess you were right.
I wasn't gonna swim, I was gonna dig a hole!
All right, well finish your coffee; let's go.
That's not gonna happen. No. Because we have a new deal!
I know!
Because it's impossible to find her apartment! She lives in some like of hot girl parallel universe, or something.
Well all right so, it looks like we're even!
Thank you all for coming. We're here today to pay respects to a wonderful agent and a beautiful woman... ..inside. As Estelle's only two clients we would like to say a few words. Dude, where's my speech? That is entertaining. Al Zebooker everybody.
So spooky, that's all.
Yeah!
No, no, it's not a girl, it's... a brand new Hugsy!
No! No, I-I just wanna thank you guys for what you did for my parents, that was really sweet. They're so happy they get to be a part of your special day.
Night, you guys.
Paper, snow, a ghost!
You're not going to believe this!
Hey! Are those crab cakes? Did I not tell ya to come straight to me when more crab cakes were ready?
Uh, de-clawing cats. Hey, tell ya what. Let me walk you home. We'll stop by every news stand and burn every copy of their Times and the Post.
Will you pick one, just pick one! Here, how about that one?
So that if we went out on a date, shed be there.
No! No, and I did not ask her to marry me!
Note the painterly lines and subtle impasto on this canvas. Monet painted quickly and usually outdoors as his elusive subject was light itself.
uh uh!
Come on Pheebs! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!
C'mon show us what you bought. . . You know you want to.
Nooo. I had a story all worked out but then Chandler sold me out.
I don't know, it looks the same.
Well, you gotta give him something that he can't say no too. Like uh, Knicks tickets! Invite the guy to a Knicks game, you're guaranteed he'll say yes!
Yeah.
Hey Ma. Listen, I made the appointment with Dr. Bazida, and... Excuse me? Did you know this isn't Ma?
Chandler!
That he doesn't exist.
No-no-no-no-no we came together!
What's up?
Yeah-eh-eah! Oh-oh, sorry, I-I knew what he meant.
But what does that gonna do...
It's not what you said. It's the way you said it....Oh My God, I'm a woman!!!
Uh, wow, you just said a bunch of stuff I didn't know there.
Yes! Yes!! And every time you look at it, I want you to remember that you are a good person. Okay, you've had the chance to cheat, and with me, but you didn't. And that's what this ring stands for.
No-no, thank you.
Shh. He did it. He told her off, and not just about the kiss, about everything.
Good luck. And I'm still right!
That's right Ross, I can see you in your new apartment! And you can see me! Same as yesterday, same as the day before.
Uhh, the ball thing.
All right. But, you're gonna have to tell them.
Well maybe I got a little upset and maybe I told them where they could go.
Pheebs, I'm so sorry.
Yeah, the Knicks rule all!
Okay, maybe he's not his best friend, but ...
A little more, a little more. A little more... All right. Okay, all right, let's do this.
No, I didn't!
Hey!! We are so in luck! Treeger said that we could have all this cool stuff from the basement. Wait right there.
He's right, cause if you're just gonna, like, break his heart, that's the kind of thing that can wait.
Okay. Can I borrow 94 dollars?
Uh, can I talk to you for a second, over there?
Hey, Kate!
I saw you.
Eddie.
Because, I know what I like and what I don't like! It's not the same thing!
But you can't stay with Phoebe, Ross! We're-we're roomies!
This will just be my batch.
What?
All right! Man, this is unbelievable! I mean, it's great, but...
It doesn't look good, does it?
Oh man, she's so smokin, she has got the greatest set of. . . no guys around, huh.
But between you and Phoebe, I'd have to give the edge to Phoebe.
Tell me who it is.
Yeah!
And you don't a little good about donating the money?
Yeah.
Wow! You blow my mind...
Hey-hey, who's your friend? Hey!!
Hey!
Yeah. I realized it about a half-hour ago but I didn't want to say anything 'cause I didn't want to jinx it.
Okay. Okay. Ace!
No, no, no!
Hey Mon, do you have another pillow? Y'know, something a little snugglyer?
Oh. No! No wait, that's weird!
Ah-ah-ah! We're doing this! Okay, now you got me my first set of head shots. Right, how much were those?
Yeah?
Hey Phoeb's, I think you're good to go.
All right, I have one question. What is the deal with this?
No-no! I used to get paid for all kinds of medical stuff, remember? Let's see uh, well I don't want to donate sperm again. I really prefer doing that at the home office y'know? Ooh-ooh, maybe they want like some of my blood or-or spit or something, huh?
When I was little, I wanted to be a veteranarian, but then I found out you had to put your hands into cows and stuff.
I mean come on you guys! My own TV show? I just don't know if I'm good enough.
I didn't get it?
Oh, yeah, that. All right, means that much to ya, I'll let you have her.
So.... back to your place...you thinking, maybe... huh-huh?
Wow!!
No just, nobody press on my stomach.
Ahhhhhhhhhh...
She was nothing compared to you.
Okay, imagine the best sex you've ever had.
Oh, I'm sorry. Did I get 'ya?
Open the box!!
Look, it was a job all right?
Come on, Chandler, Ross is our friend. He needs us right now, so why don't you be a grown up and come and watch some TV in the fort!
Okay, Ross, I realise that you didn't expect to walk in and see that, but.. Let me explain, okay?
I'm sorry man, I didn't-I'm-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I don't care, Rach! Look, I am tired of being the guy who knows all the secrets but can't tell anyone!
So you've been sittin' around here all mornin'?
Sorry.
Oh, all right, I can ask Monica.
I'm so sorry. Look, if it was up to me you would never leave the show.
All right Pheebs, stick out your plate!
I was thinking Chinese food.
Are you all right?
Okay, get ready to owe me!
So I guess it's Joey then!
We've been stood up. And we want our free crab cakes.
Ewwwww!! Ew! Ew! Ew!
Yeah may-maybe you don't tell anyone about this.
Oh-whoa-hey, dude, what are you doing?!
Great!
Duh, where've you been?
No it isn't! No, it's not. Because you can also explain it with the truth!
All right, that's it. Y'know I was still gonna let you have her. But now, forget about it. Prepare to feel very bad about yourself.
Check out the rack on this chick!
Uh, Pheebs, you had a barrel for a dollhouse?
Dude, if you think Fireball's relaxing, you've obviously have never played.
You son of a bitch!
Oh, you're Phoebe's fan!
I don't think so.
Where's my underwear?!
He's talking to London!
...look both ways before you cross the street.
Why is 10 the highest?
Oh, yeah, good idea.
Wow! That was good. That was... Tweezers?
Ah! Huh?
So uh listen, I think I'm gonna take off now.
Not like we used to. Remember? You and me used to be inseparable. Y'know now it's like...things are different.
Ketchup!
Hey, how you doin'?
Matter of fact, I do.
Hey.
It's not what you think, that was...
Oh no, were you upset? Did you lose sleep?
Yeah. Yeah, so what? Look, I live across the street, and I know all about you and your little telescope, and I don't appreciate it, okay? Yeah, I can see you right now! Hello! If I wanna walk around my apartment in my underwear, I shouldn't have to feel like Thank you, but... that's not really the point... The point is that... Mostly free weights, but occasionally..
So, there was no miracle?!
Ben, Ben, hey Ben. Nothing. I don't think that's his name.
