Cantaloupe juice.
Ready?
... is it weird that it's not with each other?
I brought you back a present.
Twenty-one hours, you're a hero.
Joey!
Yeah! Yeah, it was definitely an improvement. G'night.
No. We had a really good talk. I don't think I'm gonna do that bar scene anymore.
Monica, why don't you finish off these pies? I don't have any more room left in the fridge.
The doctor will be here in a minute to do your sonogram.
No-no it's okay. It's just that ah, I thought we had something pretty special here. And y'know I-I felt like you were someone I could finally open up to, and... That there's so much in me I have to share with you yet.
Hey, you got one right!
Do I have a minute to go to the bathroom?
Good-bye Chandler Bing.
It's Joey right?
Well, yes, and now. Yes I did say it, and no, I didn't not say it.
Well, this is fun. So Ross, did you kill any of these wives?
What?!
Alll right, we'll call you in a few minutes.
Y'know what? I may regret this but uh, I'm going to give you a shot.
Umm, no.
Well....
Lipson knows. Do you have any idea who else knows?
That's right.
Yes, yes I was.
What?!
No.
Rachel! Rachel!
Ta-daaa!
Car's waiting downstairs, I just wanted to drop off these copies of my book for your friends. Anything you want from Lisbon?
No! No dessert, just a check, please.
Really?
Yeah, is she really 20.
God. I love you.
Can you be my dancing partner?
...I just get this craving for Kung Pow Chicken.
Yeah, not really. Babies are dull.
I uh, I gotta tell you man, I mean, that's uh, it's kinda out of the blue, I mean don't you think?
She's not much of a phone person.
Oh, thanks.
You two know each other?
I see the head.
Yeah.
Sorry.
Oh, ohhhhh.
Well, then it's not on the wall yet.
Actually, I was kinda hoping it would be the other way around.
Just the last two pages.
I love you, too.
You are!
So Monica let me ask you a question. Y'know, since we broke up do you ever, think about me?
And what's the one kind of boat that can never, ever sink?
Shut up!
So you're asking us to refund your donation to the children?
Here, let me help.
Oh cool! You made him cry!
So I guess Rachel had you baby?
Well, Chandler and I used to make out! A lot!
Well, that was ah...
I want to talk to that bastard, see what his problem is.
Yeah?
Oh, isn't it exciting, I mean it's like having a boyfriend for life.
Oh, all right, fine, fine, fine.
Wait, you're not 'G.Stephanopoulos?' Man, my dad's gonna kill me!
Howard's the handy man!
Excuse me?
She's also a scientist, so she's very smart and pretty and... well, it's actually because of you, really, that we're together, I mean, I saw what you had with that Mike guy, and I just said "Boy, I want that".
So! Me neither! God, Mary-Angela was right you do have the softest lips.
I'm not allowed to have soda.
It's the key to my Porsche. Well, the key to your Porsche.
Hi.
I'm sorry, really, I'm so embarrassed. Really, I'm a pretty nice guy. Just ask my parole officer...Apparently I'm not a funny guy.
Cut! Cut!
Yeah, we loves 'em. I've never seen him with-
So, except for the fermentation process, beer and ale are basically the same thing. Fascinating isn't it.
The woman I love is having a baby today. I've been waiting for this just as much as you have.
Not necessary.
Wait! Wait! There is the train station!
Monica, Chandler. I'd like you to meet Erica.
I'm sorry. Does the smoke bother you?
Great. Uhh, just tell her her husband stopped by.
You're dying?!
That was a great lecture today. Did you get a little hair cut?
There's nothing to wonder about, Monica. You're gonna go back to being exactly who you were, because that's who you are.
But I'm sorry. There's nothing I can do... Ah, it's not true, there is... nothing I want to do.
Please, it's because otherwise I really don't know what I might do.
I thought I heard voices. You must be Chandler.
Okay, so since umm, you're not going to jail tonight I was wondering if you would like to go to dinner with me?
Well, we better get going, it's late. Jack's not allowed to drive at night anymore. He has trouble staying in his lane.
There's one leaving in thirty minutes.
I don't think that's gonna affect the plot of the show.
Can I please see your face?
Hey Ross!
So. I guess I'll see you around.
Yeah, they still wear underwear.
It's made from eggs!
I'll be okay.
"Oh, you sick bastard!"
What's the matter?
I moved back here a couple of months ago.
Congratulations you two!
No-no it's not! I don't want to lose you! It's-it's like I was saying to Ursula when I was making love to her and I thought she was you-Yeah it is too weird.
Ahh, nooo!!
Bert, Bert. Bert. Hey, what happened to my friend Bert? He was here just a moment ago. Oh no, my old friend Bert is lost.
Just so I know, if I had asked first...
Oh, crap!
Wow. Oh, I am really flattered, but I just I don't feel that way about you.
And, by the way, I really enjoyed your paper on the connection between geographic isolation and rapid mutagenesis.
Let it be me! Let it be me!
Joey.
Yeah, hey.
We'd better take these pants off upstairs or that stain's gonna set.
Well, ever since we announced the engagement, he's been acting really weird, and then last night, he came home smelling like Chanel.
Ohh, its been better. The Annual Net Usage Statistics are in.
Do you know where the store is?
Actually I've been playing a lot of love songs lately. I've missed you.
Where you goin'?
Ding!
We got the grant. Three years, all expenses paid.
Hi sweetie!
Just your dad. Although that's actually racquetball. You know I-I do have a blind date with my sister's neighbour next Tuesday.
Think I better go before mommy starts weeping.
Sure! Why not? You could be my sister for the day.
Hey Toby, you got a sec?
As much as he needs.
Pass!
Oh, it's just... It's up to you. It's your name. You've got to live with it.
Oh, please, honey, listen, if I can do it, anybody can. You just start with half a dozen European cities, throw in thirty euphemisms for male genitalia, and bam! You have got yourself a book.
No!
A 98. I deducted 2 points because you are not wearing your chef's hat, and that is a Section 5 violation.
Do you have a moment to talk about your lecture?
Rach, I'm sorry, but you didn't give me any contracts!
Okay.
I'm Andrew, and I didn't pay for this pear.
Yeah.
Umm, no.
Yeah, you can melt art. Hey, can I use your phone?
Umm, no. See I already thought she was dead so I kinda made my peace with it. Plus, I'm going to a concert tomorrow. So... I'd invite you, but umm, I only have two tickets left.
What do you need help for?
Thank you so much!
No, there was an appliance left on in the bathroom. It's looks like a curling iron.
Sure. Sure. Second's up! Not...that kind of table.
Yeah?
Y'know, you look nothing like I would've thought. You're...you're so young.
I'm sorry Joey that's...that's the way it is.
Ditto.
Well, what do you want me to say?
Sorry David, but she really has to know this.
Hey.
Thank you so much! 'Cause I-I know I can do better!
Oh, thanks! That's so sweet!
No, unfortunately Lizzie's mom passed away shortly after she was born. I raised her by myself.
No, I'm getting it. I'll be right back.
What are you? Eight?
You're late!
Then uh, what's-what's this?
Yeah. I can just go home and get back at him by myself.
I don't know. I think maybe one of them is dying. I kinda hope it's the girl. The guy is really cute!
Mom, I thought I told you... Phoebe's a vegetarian.
Wow! That's wild! No, I had no idea.
Do I dare ask?
Really?!
You're in this picture?
I was, uh, checking out that insurance company's Christmas party on three, oh, it was really beautiful, they have all these decorations and this huge tree and I just, uh... to hell with them, we have to work. -- So I stole ther ham.
My name in Mike, and I do play piano.
Can I help you?
It's the basketball playoffs.
Oh, my baby!
What?
Sorry, members only.
Hi.
No! I did!
Oh, no, no, no... That's okay. I got a lot of offers from other families. I just picked you guys because... I liked you the best.
That is so sweet!
No, I wanna melt it.
Oh, there's tonnes of terrific stuff-I'll go with you!
Oh, well, we can go see the Chronos Quartet at the Avery Fisher Hall.
Yeah, yeah, yeah... This is so weird. I mean, you never know when it's gonna be your last dance. And I didn't even get a chance to finish it.
Take thee, Emily...
Oh, alright.
Well, I kinda did. Me. Eight weeks of me.
Oh my God!
I'm ready!
...so y'know, that's why, within a few years, that voice recognition is gonna be pretty much standard on any computer you buy. Y'know, so you could be like-like, 'Wash my car.' 'Clean my room.' It's not gonna be able to do any of those things, but it'll understand what you're saying.
An advance?
Hey! What's going on?
Hi, Alan.
That is great. Good work! Chandler. Thank you.
Seriously, your dad doesn't like pranks.
You told me you didn't see anything.
Oh, let me see what I can do. There are some first class seats available.
All right, on the table.
Six? You want me to join you?
Oh, excuse me! I think you dropped s... Wow!
13.
Yeah, a box full of your desk stuff doesn't exactly say big promotion.
Okay look, Ross, just so you know that since Lizzie likes you so much, I've decided to accept the fact that you're going out with her.
Ohhhh!
Oh, come on! Come on!
"I don't know!"
Chandler Bing!
Why'd you freak out?
H-Hi!! And you are...?
No.
Thank you.
Mark!!
Hi. So good news, the divorce is final. I signed the papers this A.M.
Uh, yes.
If you have the time, I'd really appreciate the help.
Oh, that-that would be great. So you didn't even get to Italy?
I-I am Kristen.
No, it's you!
Well, Telia Shire suddenly became available.
As my lawfully wedded wife, in sickness and in health, till death parts us.
What?
Oh please, I memorized those numbers when I was 15. But look at all the cool make-it-on-my-own stuff I got! This is my "Please, hire me" sweater. And these are my, "Don't you want to rent me this apartment?" pants.
Yeah, it's not. But I'm rich and thin.
Yeah, I'm just, I'm just in town for a conference. Umm, God you look phenomenal!
You okay?
Hi!
Please, stay on the line. Your call is important to us.
Ameri-ccan.
Sure!
No, I can't.
Remember the class play? You, you pulled up my skirt and the entire auditorium saw my underpants.
Am I interrupting?
Oh, I love your neighborhood. There's a great gym right around the corner from your building.
And it is annoying when parents put their baby on the phone...
Rachel?
Kate Miller's awkward and mannered portrayal is laughable. Badda-badda-badda. Ah-ha! Here it is! The direction by Marshal Talmant is... Thank you, boys and girls, you've ruined my life. Please, stuff your talentless faces with my Mother's crab cakes! Excuse me!!
Yeah, drop it! Drop the towel! Please drop the wowww.
Hi darling.
I'm okay.
Oh, it's good news. No, it's definitely good news. Hold on a second, I have another call. Hey, how's it going?
He proposed to you? This is the worst birthday ever.
Thank you for your patience, you're the next caller.
So you spied on me. I can't believe you don't trust me.
Hi there.
Take 36 is up!
I got you...these.
No I won't!
You're not good!
It's so cool man, it's so, it's just 'cause being with her is so much better than like not being with her.
Sweetheart. Oh sorry were late, my fault, I insisted on riding the tube.
No.
Hi Joey.
And this is Duncan and Erin, they're gonna help us out with the audition. So uh, let's get the camera rolling.
Yeah?
And, of course, if you feel that neither of those is right for you, you can always adopt.
Oh.
Oh believe me, I-I-I've been there. I had to sort mannequin heads at that Mannequins Plus.
Uh yeah, I can't believe I ever went out with somebody who would actually have an open flame in the middle of a wooden area.
Doesn't matter.
I know! I-I'm a big fan of yours.
Look umm Joey, I-I don't think you're quite right for this project.
Will you call him?
No you stop!
I'm pretty sure, professor Spafford from Cornell?
To get my coat.
Hi Rachel.
And if I want to call for a reference on your last job?
Ohh!
Oh, listen you guys. I have this friend at Bloomingdale's who's quitting tomorrow and he wants to abuse his discount. So, anyone want to come with me and take advantage of it?
Listen Joey, we definitely want to see you for the callback on Saturday.
That he wouldn't pay for my lawyer! Then he told me to come here and learn about the value of money from the one daughter he's actually proud off.
But, I was curious; do you have any plans for tonight?
The woman I love... I love you... Which is probably something I shouldn't say for the first time in front of my parents... and Tom and Sue...Who are by the way the most sinfully boring I've ever met in my life...
The three losers. Oh, poor Lily. Ohh, y'know I-I heard about what happened, that must have been just terrible for you, losing your mother that way.
Who is it?
Oh, you're so funny. Listen, umm, what are you doing after rehearsals? Do you want to get a drink, or something?
So wait, what's the deal here, I can have sex with you, but I can't touch you?
Cut.
its Mike Hanagen.
Okay, but it's Valentine's Day!
Congratulations.
Hey you guys, umm do either one of you want to get in there before I take my bath.
Ok, fine, these rats are our responsibility. What happens when they mate and there are hundreds of them?
Yeah, Merry... Christmas.
If anyone asks, we'll just say Ben addressed them. Oh! So you invited Rachel then?
Umm, yeah, actually, Susan's gonna be home any minute, it's kinda an anniversary.
Joey Tribbiani. Yes, ok. Hold on. She wants to talk to you. Take the phone.
In human terms, I'd say Cybill Shepard.
Well okay, if it means that much to you, then I'll ask him out.
I'm Gail.
We're both teachers.
I don't want to talk about it.
Are you looking at her?!
Is that what you say to Chandler?
So, see ya on Saturday.
Stop!
Caitlin!
Uh-huh, I don't know.
Are you talking about me?
You do now. You're having dinner with me.
Hey!
Dennis Phillips
Hey Joey.
Hi honey.
Actually she's my-my boss. Sous is French for under.
Oh look.
Hey! I'm proud of that sauce, it's delicious.
Ha! Ahhhhhhh!
You asked him too?!
Yeah alright, that sounds alright.
Understood. So, what'd you say back then?
And the man who made all this possible... Mr. Peter Becker.
Oh, hi. I'm professor Wealer.
Look Rachel, I know what you're going through. I'm totally freaked about turning 25.
Oh, believe me, I don't want to get hurt either. I'm being smart about this. See these guys? They're the best trainers in the world, and Hoshi here used to be a paid assassin. A house painter! He used to be a house painter.
What people?
I certainly see what the girls like coming here.
So, how come you wanted to eat in tonight?
Thanks.
Chandler, I'm gonna have you arrested.
So, are you experiencing any discomfort?
Come on.
So umm, you feel like taking a test? There's only one question.
I got it!
This where they put it? What, there no table available in the kitchen! Hello, baby.
Wanna make it more interesting?
Very cool.
Is there any entertainment there? What are people doing?
Don't you want to know about the sex?
No! No! It's just that, my dad never did. I miss my dad.
Oh, thanks for the tip.
Yeah, most of the damage is pretty mostly contained in the bedrooms.
Really? Because I think about you all the time.
Did anybody call for security?
Yes, and come see the bird show at 4. The macaws wear hats. Well it's a lot cuter if your monkey hasn't just died.
You didn't!
Nana is on the phone.
Hi.
Scotch.
Monica bang!
I'm sorry Amber. It's just like Brad to have to have the last word.
My God, what were you thinking about?
Ross. You and I are going to have to have a little talk.
Ross, sweetheart!
Christmas eve.
Oh God! You see, that's what I was afraid of!
Yeah, well you'd be better if you just loosened your hips a little.
Keep in mind, he's never used this product before, you're gonna see how easy this is to do. Go ahead. This works with any milk carton.
Uh-oh, I feel another one coming.
Are you guys ready?
I write erotic novels, for children.
No, it's a wedding ring. You gotta get rid of it. We're gonna go to the East River right now and throw it in there!
Yeah.
No.
I can show you an ID if you want?
Oh, I'll-I'll be fine. Just God I hate her Ross! I hate her!
Dr. Gettleman is finishing up with a patient, he should be out shortly.
Did you bring the toe?
Bye.
Joe, I love Phoebe. She's the single most important thing in my life. I'd die before I let anything happen to her.
Well we left ours in Monica's bedroom.
France sucks!
Hi. I'm here for Ross Geller's memorial service.
What? Do you think he likes me?
Well...I Only Have One Thing To Do Today. I guess I could push it back.
Phoebe, Phoebe relax, it's okay. I mean we never said this was exclusive.
Really?
Chandler, you were the strongest person in the program. We're offering you the position of junior copywriter.
Uhm... Ha ha!
Do you?
You're strict.
Poo?
I knew it, wow!!
I had to cut my hair to get rid of the uh, fogger smell.
Baby. Ross.
Well that's uh, that's a good point. Um ok, well, uh, I guess I got the wrong apartment then. I, I'm, look, I'm, ya know, I'm sorry, I'm terriably sorry.
Hey, it's not my business, besides it's probably a good thing. We really would have been spoiling the children, all those food, and warm clothing...
Well, her memory is pretty much gone.
Remember, Emma, heart disease kills women too!
Hey, what do you want to drink?
Hi, pig!
Of course we'll help! Yeah! We'll be here!
It's me.
Actually, that can't happen. Yeah because you all have such different looks, we're putting you with Raymond and Kyle with Ben. So it'll be either you two or you two.
Uh actually, I'd like to speak with both of you.
Yeah, Joey and Chandler sure are funny.
Jack? I hate him! He's a jerk.
Which one?
Rust, is boat cancer, Ross.
What? Dr. Wilson's an artist! He removed my mole cluster. Wanna see?
And if it were true, how dare you come to me ask me for tips about a character that I've been playing for 20 years-I'll give you a tip!
Yeah?
Can I help you?
Hey!
You're an excellent patient!
Hey you're in our seats.
You might wanna get back in there.
Why not?!
Dancing on your feet! Like the other girls did it.
...emblem of the land I love. The home of....
You making fun of me? Because I am not a sell-out. I didn't do that for the money, I believe in those phones. I almost lost a cousin because of bad wireless service.
Yes I can. Because if I go it means I have to break up with you, and I can't break up with you.
What's he talking about?
Right. Well, on behalf of the children: thank you both very much.
that's why she was weird.
Uhm, it's USA, sir.
I can tell you work out. A paleontologist who works out, you're like Indiana Jones.
Can I get you some coffee?
I hate my parents.
I intend to marry her.
Well, here's your phone doctor.
Oh my God! There's a toe in my kitchen.
Hey, listen. Call me.
Hi, I'm Lisa.
Sure, New Year's Eve is only two weeks away. Can you wait?
God, your hair sure is different!
You've sung Happy Birthday to 20 different women today!
Yeah well, that's the thing. For me it's as far as it can ever go.
No. The one in Atlantic City, Dad loves the slots. He says he's gonna double the college money my Grandma left me.
God, you're gonna be here all night!
So, all right.
Yeah.
This is from the woman at the bar.
No, she touched mine first!
Very much.
Wow, uh, anything else I should know?
Oh, yeah. Wasn't that like a year ago?
Y'know I wanted to tell you yesterday, but I just, I kinda felt all floopy, and...
That you and daddy were not on a break.
And he was my best student.
Hello. Oh! It's you. Just ah, just one-one sec. I am going to take this call. When I continue, I hope that there will appear on stage this magical thing that in the theatre we call, committing to the moment!
Well, that could take a while.
They still want me for General Hospital.
Certainly.
Ross.
Cut!
I'll tell you what, Chandler, why don't you call me when you grow up!
Yeah.
Really?!
Oh! You know what I need?
Fill this out and bring it back to me.
That would be great! Also, uh, I was hoping to catch a show so if you can make any suggestions...
Uh, no! No! That's...art! If it bothers you I can put my art out.
What was that?
I'm Dutch.
Oh, oh, I thought we were just talking.
Of course!
I wanted to say how much I enjoyed your class.
But Rachel I thought she just had a baby with Ross.
I'm sorry. Ex-excuse us. I'm sorry, it's a little crowded. Do you mind if we...
Oh my God. This plane doesn't even have a Philange!
Ohhhh. Relax, take it easy buddy. Tell me twice, you want me to go? Alright, alright, guess I'll be back for my stuff. But if you think for one second I'm leaving you alone with my fish, you're insane Jack!
Ross, I love you!
And...Action!
Oh, sure, yeah. This is the one of you father in a meadow, and, uh, helping a little boy fly a kite, and here he is at a graduation. . . another graduation. . . another graduation.
I was going to call him, but...
Yo! Can I have your attention, please, Best Man, making a toast here. Thank you. I remember when Barry got home from his first date with Rachel...
I'm just taking you outside!
Thanks for having me over, you guys.
Excuse me?
I don't think so.
Yes! I have it right here. Would you like to try it on Ms. Waltham?
So hum...Why did I have to hide?
Well they could be true.
Yeah, a Pretty Huge...
Well uh, Ross? This is Joey. Joey? Ross.
Well, i-it's okay. I-I-I understand... Well, s... well, are you happy with this guy?
He's kind of intense huh?
You don't think they'll judge and ridicule me?
Sure, sure. Come on... ...in...
Oh, isn't a shame when one girl ruins it for the whole bunch?
Who in God's name are you?
We?
Try. There's my little girl.
I'd love to, but my lawyer said I can't do that anymore.
Ezel.
Are you on board?
You're into hardcore S&M right?
I thought he was with you.
No no no, no no no, neat, as in no rocks.
Hurry up I gotta pray!!
Shut up!
Hey, you like pizza?
Oh honey, I'm fine.
Morning.
"Hi, this is Richard. Please, leave a message at the tone."
All right. Keep pushing! Come on!
This guy? Seriously? Later in the day.
I didn't need to know that. I guess 21 years is a lot. I mean, hell, I'm a whole person who can drink older than you.
Oh my God! Someone, he's choking. Is anyone here a doctor?
So this is it? Victor?
I think you should give him your star.
If that helps you.
I tell you, this wedding is not going to happen.
I think that's fair.
Really?
Hey, how, how did you do that?
That's me.
It says here that the knife went right through your shoe.
It's, uh, it's Paul.
'Cause you're a little princess! "Daddy, buy me a pizza. Daddy, buy me a candy factory. Daddy, make the cast of Cats sing Happy Birthday to me..."
So am I!
Chandler is fantastic!!
Hey!
You're so sweet!
There you go.
