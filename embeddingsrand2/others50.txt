So I got it in the junior miss department, big diff. Anyway check it out man, it's gonna make a hell of a conversation piece at out next cocktail party, huh pal?
I'm an idiot. Uh, is your mother here? Maybe I can give her a little slap on the butt.
Hi!
I've missed you so much! No, I'm not gonna ask you to get back together because I know we want different things, but just to be with you one more night.
No, just a salad will be fine.
Uh Bing, I think we're gonna make this the last game.
But then I'd have to go all the way around the dry cleaner place.
This is a nice resume. Nice, nice, nice. Muy impressivo.
Umm, no.
Yeah, yeah, all the time.
Great, I'll see you then.
Alright!
Hey, Weird Girl.
This witness won't return my calls so we're gonna see if we can surprise him coming home.
No no no, I wanna hear it from your lips.
All right, enough! I don't want to hear about it anymore! Good luck, Chandler.
I know! I haven't even read them the specials yet!
In the park?
Hey.
Ohh! We're kidding! Oh, we're kidding!
What?
Yeah.
Can I get you a cup of coffee?
It's like Mardi Gras without the paper mache heads. How 'bout you?
You must be a little uncomfortable.
Me too!
"I'd like to go for a walk", uhm "scratch my belly".
Sure. Okay.

He says he was too.
Ameri-ccan.
Oh hi Rachel.
Hi! It's Tom, I'm here to pick up the phone.
Hi!
I'll be back in ten minutes.
You're so welcome.
No dear, that's what babies do.
Trick or treat!
You look familiar, have we...
Oh that'd be great. Sure!
Ohh!

So am I!
Please.
Hangs up.
