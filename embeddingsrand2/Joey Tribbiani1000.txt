To tape the game? You do this every time Ross, you're not gonna be on TV!
We've been stood up. And we want our free crab cakes.
Look, Chandler I don't think us getting our asses kicked is a solution. Okay? Just go and find Monica!
Wow! Look at this! He wrote a check for 50,000 dollars to Hugo Ligrens Ring Design. Oh, sorry, what do you think the good news is?
Didn't I tell ya? Always showin' off.
Noooo, that's what I was wearing when I donated. I'm kinda surprised there's any of my boys left.
Then why are you wearing Monica's jacket?
But my mom always makes them. It's like a tradition. You get a little piece of turkey on your fork, a little cranberry sauce, and a tot! It's bad enough I can't be with my family because of my disease.
She took 'em!
I wanna be mr. Wigglemunch.
Wow, it is easy. Now, I can have milk everyday.
Look Rach, wasn't this supposed to a temporary thing? I thought you wanted to do fashion stuff?
What you-you don't think I'm gonna win?
Whoa!!!
Oh, like you've never gotten a little rambunctious with Ross.
No! I'm up for a Soapie!
Y'know what?
Ohh, a hunk of sandwich from last year.
I wish I could but I just found out that I have to be at work really early the next day, so I can't go, but, you know, take the extra ticket and invite whoever you want.
Hey bear, I need some career advice.
Hi!
No dude, you gotta hold your breath until you're ready to answer the question.
I didn't look at it. Stupid baby's head was blocking most of it.
Hey, whaddya wanna do for dinner?
Yeah, we'll be fine.
Alright, alright. I'm around. Go ahead.
I'M CURVY, AND I LIKE IT!
Yeah, and I met this really hot single mom at the store. What's an elf to do?
It's called Shutter Speed, it's really cool! Yeah, umm, I meet this girl in the subway and we fall in love in like a day, right? And then, she disappears... But I find out where she lives and when I get there this like old lady answers the door and I say, "Where's Betsy?" Right? And she says, "Betsy's been dead for 10 years."
Hey! Samboucha Margarita?
Hey Estelle, listen...
I got it! Here we go.
Ben, Ben, hey Ben. Nothing. I don't think that's his name.
What?
You do it!
Fan out! Fan out!
Right... ok, so just from the top of the page, right here.
All right! So that's it! It's over! Everybody knows!
Not much to tell there I'm really shy.
Hey!
Really? Do you not know Chandler?
Yeah, he's just really great to hang around with.
The bigger half.
Come on C.H.E.E.S.E., I'm not leaving without you! Try routing your backup source through your primary CPU.
Uh, why, it's a... one of her favorites, uh, "Riding the Storm Out. Coping with post-partum depression" eesh! "Love you forever". Love you forever. By Robert Munsch. Published by Firefly books. Printed in Mexico. A mother held her new baby and very slowly rocked him back and forth, back and forth, back and forth, and while she held him she sang "I'll love you forever, I'll like you for always, as long as I'm living, my baby you'll be". . And while he rocked her, he sang "I'll love you forever, I'll like you for always, as long as I'm living, my baby you'll be".
Whoa-whoa-whoa. Jokes? You guys know they have naked chicks in there, right?
You wanna know wh...? You wanna know why?
Hey! He beat ya.
Because she is!
my god woman! How many people do you have to had been with not to remember any of this?
Hey.
And I got custody of the kid, right? Now suppose the kid dies and-and I gotta buy a new kid.
je.
Yeah, I-I think that women just have a lower threshold of pain than men, that's all. I mean, come on, it's just a little wax.
What's happenin'?
Hi. I'm Joey Tribbiani; I'm here to audition for man.
That's how they do pants! First they go up one side, they move it over, then they go up the other side, they move it back, and then they do the rear. What? Ross, Ross, would you tell him? Isn't that how they measure pants?
Hey!
Really?!
She's gone. She had a bag and she left.
Oh, yeah. He's got that great baby smell. Get a whiff of his head.
I love ya.
He- he- he got in, he- he got in to San Diego.
Hey!
Come on, we were great together. And not just at the fun stuff, but like, talking too.
What is the big deal? It's not like we're exclusive.
Hey.
Oh, yeah, well I already did that! They said they're gonna look into it right after they solved all the murders.
Yeah! Ask them if they brought their friends any souvenirs!
This guy says hello, I wanna kill myself.
Oh good, uh you're here. Uh Pheebs? Listen uh sit down. I-I got something I want to say.
Pheebs, run!
She was all crying. She-she said you guys want different things, and that and that she needed time to think.
Oh, yeah, yeah, listen for it.
All right, here's a list of things for you to do today. Man, this going to be so great! Thank you so much! All right, I got to go to work I'm delivering twins today, but only one of them is mine!
Oo...what's in the bag?
Really. And what do you mean you never have fun anymore? You have fun with me, remember that time we saw those strippers and you paid me 50 bucks to eat that book?
I don't get it, Chandler loved it!
No, I do six things! First, I look deep in her eyes. Then, I kiss her. Next I take my hand and I softly graze her thigh.
Hey, hey, check it out, guess what I got.
All right that's it, school is in session!
Half the taste is in the smell! You-you're sucking up all the tastiness!
What? What?
Oh well, it's not on TV yet.
Yeah, I know.
No-no! No! No! You don't tell a Broadway guy that! Now he just thinks I'm a soap actor.
Morning, roomie!
Come on man, you drove all the way up here.
Hey Gunther, let me get a lemonade to go.
I couldn't do it.
Hey, no matter what happens with Ross and Emily, we still get cake right?
Oh yeah, yeah! He's done tons of commercials. I've seen him in like Sugar Smacks, Playstation, and that one for the phone company. In fact he was so good in that one, he actually convinced me to switch phone companies. Chandler was mad....
Ross? You okay?
This is like the temporary robot, right?
Good night.
What is it? Hey!
Yeah but, I can pronounce Jurassic.
I can give it a shot.
That's it? You're-you're gonna let me do this?! This-this is my career we're talking about here!
Actually, y'know it's kinda cold, so how about I keep my boxers on, and give you all a peek at the good stuff?
If you want some privacy you can use my hole.
Pheebs!
I'm so confused!
Thank you.
If you hated the bracelet so much, Chandler, you should have just said so.
Je te flouppe Fli.
So...What?
Your eyebrows look weird.
Oh! Hey right! Not a problem. I totally understand. You need to y'know make sure I don't have any horrible scars or tattoos. Don't you worry; I have nothing to hide. So there you go, that's me. One hundred percent natural! I tell ya, that has never happened before.
Yeah! She is cool, and she's so smart! Her mind is totally acrimonious . That's not how she used it...?
Oh, little party favours, check it out!
It's okay. You know, I totally understand, alright? You guys, make way more sense than her and I ever did, you know. And... I want you to be happy.
You partied with Hootie and the Blowfish?
Oh my God I have to tell her! I haven't even thought about what I will say. What should I say?
Oh, hey, how about this? Wanna be an extra on my show?
ALL FOOD!
Hey, is that when you wrote salt water taffy man?
Hey, woah, hey, woah.
I'm so worried about him, y'know?
Huh.
C'mon, you're going out with the guy! There's gotta be something wrong with him!
Well, that was only 'cause I used the red one to unclog the drain.
You can't just give up! Is that what a dinosaur would do?
You can't have S-E-X, when you're taking care of the B-A-B-I-E!
Hey!
Yeaah.
Well, the duck...
Oh man, pizza? I like pizza. Put olives on the pizza.
Oh, that sounds like fun, but we've got a ring to find!!
That's a huge thing!
Oh well, the powerball lottery is upto 300 million and they don't sell tickets here in New York, so...
Oh yeah-yeah, the lobster.
I went back to Riffs. I think Ursula likes me. All I ordered was coffee, she brought me a tuna meltt and four plates of curly fries.
Fumble!
Hi!
Nice!
I'd say, come again. No-no, wait I-I-I know this one, I know this one, uh...
Hey! It's your bachelor party.
I'm telling ya... I can do it.
Which what?
Does it really matter?
Hey hey! You dye your hair!
See, didn't I tell ya these pillows would be a good idea?
You think I need a new walk?
I got it.
You'd better act surprised.
Chandler Bing.
Hi!
Ok.
Okay that's the green stuff talkin'.
No! Never! Never! Bye.
See, this is why I don't date women who read. Uh-oh.
Okay.
So what's really neat. If you sear the stems of the flowers first in a frying pan, your arrangement will look fresh much longer.
They want me to be totally naked in the movie!
I got a gig!
Just pull on it.
Come on you guys, one more time.
Yeah, I uh weighted like 27 pounds when I was born so...
Oh come on. Nobody likes two different kinds of eggs equally. You like one better than the other and I wanna know which.
Man, if anyone asked me to give up any of you, I couldn't do it.
What was the other one Ross?
Some of the words are a little too sophisticated for ya?
And there you go!
And I ate the food, I had the fish, it was good, yeah. It was good, yeah...
Ah, our little ones are growing up fast, uh?
Yeah I'll take that.
Sir.
Yeah, then-then who's the guy that painted the faces on the mountain?
Yeah, I like that. But no-no, how does that explain why Rachel found my underwear at your place?
That's right, you're not. You're a nurse. You're Nurse With Tray.
...I'm his butt double. 'Kay? I play Al Pacino's butt. Alright? He goes into the shower, and then- I'm his butt.
Hey-hey, Ross?
Why not?! I'm hungry.
Give me $400!
Uh, lame cool guy handshake, yeah.
Well, I said that I...
Don't worry man, I get to bring a guest. We'll show him.
I like that! Oh, okay! Show him your bra! He's afraid of bras! Can't work 'em!
There's a part in a TV movie that I would be perfect for and I didn't even be put up for it! She'd better have a good reason.
Aww, Rach, I think you look cute And you, uh, you, you I could eat with a spoon .
Me pooh pooh!
Man, we gotta do something about that guy. This morning, I caught him looking into our apartment. It creeps me out! I feel like I can't do stuff!
I'm sorry! It was a reflex!
that would've been better, I'll try that Hi I'm Joey.
Dude, tell me she actually told you this.
No. Really?
I just want you to say it once in a while.
Great! Thanks.
Oh my God!
It's Joey.
Well I tell ya, I should probably buy a place in the city first. And I just got what you meant again-That is-I tell ya, that is a tricky one!
Hey!
Yeah! Yeah!
Rachel's having her baby!! Which is of no interest to me, I'm a neurologist.
All right, watch me! Okay, you time me. Ready?
Whoa-whoa, but her birthday isn't like for another month.
Oh, here's where I win all my money back!
Where's all the tissues?!
No.
I'm glad we had this little talk.
You think?
We did?
Yeah.
Well anyway, the guy they wanted backed out and now they want me! I start shooting today!
Yeah, yeah. He's got a, he's got a really bad cough, and our vet, he can't do anything about it. Is there something you can do?
Okay, this is it. It's my big fight scene coming up.
Hey Rach?
You fall for it every time!
Erin! Still here!
Hey guys!
Ugh!!
That's right! 'Cause I'm a Tribbiani! And this is what we do! I mean we may not be great thinkers or world leaders, we don't read a lot or run very fast, but damnit! We can eat!
The allergy guy got the part! Thanks!
No! But y'know, I'm an actor, I'll act cool.
Thirty seconds left on the timer!
Wow Dennis Phillips! That's great! How did you guys meet?
Hey!
Oh! And so the miracle of life begins, and aaiiyyyeeee!
Vulva?
Yeah, yeah sure, goodnight.
You went through my personal property?
Hey.
After!!
Oh great! Y'know I would've been perfect for this part, but whatever! Y'know, thanks for making a bad decision and ruining your movie! Good day!
Can I use your phone? Yeah, the number for a Sidney Marks, please.
I didn't tell him. I didn't know if you were telling people. This is back when I thought Kash was still people.
Look! Oh! Is that the Pope?!
No.
Hey.
Hey uh, can I, can I talk to you guys for a second?
Ross, hey, the band's ready outside for your first dance with Emily, so...
No.
What's going on?
Okay.
Exactly.
Hey, I didn't stalk her. I mean
Hey, I got one keyhole and about a zillion keys. You do the math.
Yeah, like a moth to a flame, I'm telling ya. Okay all right, so now you go.
Hey, I tell you what. Let's you and me go out and have some fun. Huh? Whatever you want. Come on!
What are they doing out here? The coast's all the way over there.
Hey, excuse me, would you mind switching with me?
Of course you do! I saved him! You're mad at me! It all adds up! You want Ross out of the picture.
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Treeger, what are you doing?
Great! Go get him.
I dunno, I loved high school. Y'know? It was just four years of parties and dating and sex.
Hey, I do it every week with three cameras pointed at me and a whole crew waiting!
Hey-hey-hey!
Wait a minute, did you just make up all that stuff just to get out of being my agent.
Oh wait, before you tell me what it is! Okay, what is it?
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no... I think it's better if you tell him, you know. It's easier for a woman. That way, you know, if he gets mad, all you have to do is go... I didn't mean it. I'm so so--ooory.
And while we're down at the video store, you know what else we could rent? Die Hard! Oh, y'know what? I just remembered, that Everest thing is only available through mail order.
No it isn't! No, it's not. Because you can also explain it with the truth!
Will you grow up? I'm not talking about sexy stuff, but, like, when I'm cooking naked.
Ah, he can't make it, he said he had to his... Whoa-oh!
Oww! Big ring!
Hey guys! I was at the library all morning and I already finished my five pages for today!
Sure.
So you uh, have a...big work problem?
That was one good minute!
Oh, what about that thing he did when he tipped the guy who showed us to our seats. You never even saw the money, it was like this. Hey Chandler, thanks for showing us to our seats .
Okay, you hide my clothes. I'm gonna do the exact opposite to you.
Yeah! No?
Well I tried, but people kept coming in and then you took your breast out!
Yeah! Y'know, she could use a little... Oh nice shot!!!
Yeah bye-bye! Hey! So just a light layer?

Growth!
And you're not helping?
Rachel, there you are! Come on, let's serve that dessert already!
Uh yes, but it was, we just did it once uh, in London.
I finished my book.
Ohhh. Ahh! What are you doing?! I thought you were gonna take her back to the store today.
Hey, hey, look! It's not about a few fries... it's about what the fries represent.
That hot girl from their wedding?
What?!! That's even worse!!
Just what needs to be done! Dearly beloved, we are gathered here to join this man and this woman...
Well, we're, we're just goin' over here so that we can get away from the horrible flesh eating virus, for the love of God woman, listen to me. Is he lookin', is he lookin'?
Listen, you know how uh, when you're wearing pants and you lean forward I check out your underwear?
Ooh, sorry. Sorry. You finish, go.
We did it!!
Hey!
What did they say?
Y'miss it?
Okay, uh...sit down. Um... there's this woman that I like. A lot. But, uh...it can't happen.
See ya! All right Pheebs, I am ready for my first lesson.
Setting the table.
A little bit more.
Uh-huh.
Right. Right. The wedding, gotcha. But I mean, it's gonna start a little late right? I mean, weddings start late. Right?
Hey you're right. Yeah, it's kinda been like us again a little bit.
I will be okay! Look Chandler, you gotta get it out of your head that I can't take care of myself. Okay? Look, I'm not gonna miss you helping me out with money. The only thing that I'm gonna miss...is you. And now the dog.
It is???
Joey! Joey.
Yeah! You...you were wonderful.
What's my little chef got for me tonight?
Hey, hey... I can convince people to do anything, you know. I bet I can even get Mike to do that "thing". What is it?
Are you sure?
Yeah, sure. Well, you must be new here. Maybe we should-I'm sorry, can I ask you something?
No-no-no, that-that's me, that's me.
I know, and only one layer of jam?! What is up with that?
Ah-ha!
Hey, y'know what? I'll come too. I'm making money now; it's about time I give something back.
Is that why you bought all this stuff?! Well, y'know what I will not watch your TV, I will not listen to your stereo, and there's a cinnamon raisin loaf in the new bread maker that I'm not gonna eat! You know why?!
No plans, huh?
I know I should've. "I'm sorry."
Hey Pheebs!
Yeah, wow, sorry Rach.
How? I guess I could break down your door.
I'm telling you, that monkey is a chick magnet! She's going to take one look at his furry, cute little face and it'll seal the deal.
Oh well then, good night!
Sure it is! She needs a pen for work, she's writing, she turns it over.... "Whoa! It's time for my date with Joey!"
How could you do this to me Chandler?! This part could've turned my whole career around!
Yeah... we really need to talk to Ross...
Well, I just tape it to the back of my toilet tank. I didn't say that! It's in a bank guarded by robots!
All right Pheebs, stick out your plate!
This is for my boat, pretty cool huh?
Dude, come on! French it u-up!
Ohh. Wow! Well how-how, how will you be gone?
Hey Phoebe!
Hi sweetie!
That's-ah what I suspected-ah.
Hey!
Wow, that was kinda brutal.
They're so small!
Double promise? Call me when you land.
All right.
pel.
Hey Mon!
I got fired.
No, was my best friend. Anyway, I don't know why you're pushing for him so hard. With him out of the way as my best friend, there's a spot open.
Okay, it all comes down to this. Whatever happens, happens. Destiny.
Hey, here she comes.
Strip joint! C'mon, you're single! Have some hormones!
Why?
Don't worry! Don't worry. I just told him, very nicely, "You don't go buying people's babies, so back off!!"
Can you tell me how this happened?
You can come over and watch the Super Bowl. Every year, all right?
One! No ten! You said ten! You can't take that back!
I didn't do that! Who would've done that?!
So that's it! It's over! Everybody knows!
Uh me? Gay? No! No. No, but I have a number of close friends who are.
Okay, see that blind guy right there? I'm gonna bash his head in later.
How about zero down and zero a month for a long, long time?
Yeah?
It doesn't look good, does it?
Ahh, I'm gonna go get some chicken. Want some?
Okay, I'm all right, okay, but hey, could you just leave your lips?
Ooh, Ross, look! Look!
Oh well, you're timing couldn't be better. I am putting out fires all over the place.
I lie better then that, right?
What's not to like? Custard? Good. Jam? Good. Meat? Gooooood.
Come on, season tickets! Season tickets, do you know what that means?
Argh!
Ooh! A tape with a girls name on it. It's probably a sex tape... Wait a minute... This says Monica... And this is Richard's apartment...
All right, so we'll get a little coffee, and get energized, and we'll head back out.
Hey, maybe that's for the best.
Okay, how long was I watching that woman?
Why would they take away our keys?
Maybe you two should live together.
Whoa! And the... huh-huh?
I don't know. Maybe pizza?
Thank you!
From the land down under? I didn't know that either!
Oh.
That would be Casey. We're going out tonight.
I wanted to go to the strip club!
Look, I can sense when women are depressed and vulnerable. It's one of my gifts.
Look, I'll come to the party but I'm not dressing up.
Yeah, life's pretty great isn't it?
Hey, I see you guys already met, huh?
Services? Oh, services.
Hey!
Oh yeah, I always picture your Mom when I'm having sex.
Well you-you-you-you might say congratulations! I saw the board! I went to the audition! I got the part!!
Good enough to get fired.
Yeah! All right? Let's go!
Hey, you don't even live here anymore! What are you doing answering my phone? I have my machine!
How could you not remember that we slept together?
Way to go robot!
No man, that's huge! Now, I know I can stand to be around her, which means I get to hang out with you, which is kinda the whole point, anyway.
I can't write! Y'know I mean I-I-I'm an actor, I don't have the discipline that takes, y'know? I can't do it.
Sorry, sorry.
Im sayin I see a difference.
Hey! I got great news!
Yeah, I mean it's never taken me a week to get over a relationship.
Mine's is to Lilian Myers.
Okay.
Yeah, I've had it.
And Rachel. I would've told you but they made me promise not to tell!
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Let her dangle.
What, what!? it's for her hot friends!
Good luck Phoebs.
I don't know how to lead.
Come on!
Get out! I couldn't stop if a meteor hit me.
Transplant.
Oh-whoa-hey, dude, what are you doing?!
Why?
You got pregnant for funny?! Dina...if he's funny...laugh! All right, I'll be back in a little while! You stay here!
Wait a minute, you can't go to Tulsa. Maybe you forgot, but we've got tickets to the Jets game next week.
You know, I'm really sorry I wasn't more supportive before.
Well Ross, what did you think she was gonna do?
Hey, listen, lady.... ...whoa.
Hey Rach.
You said you didn't want to go.
That's right I stepped up! She's my friend and she needed help! And if I had too, I'd pee on anyone of you!
Yeah right after we stole his lunch money and gave him a wedgie. What's the matter with you, he's parking the car.
We love you, man.
Oh no-no Rach, please, don't be sorry. Okay? Don't be sorry. Y'know I was only kidding you.
Oh my God.
Uhh, are you saying that you're not entirely happy about this?
Come on! Do something!
Alright, look, I'll start, OK?
I don't want them to move to a Volvo dealership!
So uh listen, I think I'm gonna take off now.
Great, I'm finished! In fact, I just dropped it off at the agency.
Come on in, how are ya?
Just okay-Did you do it right?!
Oh, I'm sorry. Thank you Chandler.
Oh, I know it... It is amazing these little things open doors... huh!
Who cares? You're Rachel! Who's Kip?
Hey-hey-hey-ho-ho, I got this one. Here you go. Y'know I gotta tell ya, sometimes I just-I don't get Chandler. Y'know, me and him do stuff all the time without you and you don't get all upset.
We're now in the ceremony, Monica is about to say, "I do" when her drunk uncle starts yelling. What do you do? Go!
Yeah!
You may be a sissy but I'll still . All right, it hurts so bad, I could only let her do oneeyebrow and now... they don't match!
Peanut butter!
What? Were you like in the movie, or... Anyway, she takes off her bra under her shirt and pulls it out the sleeve. Very sexy, and classy.
No, in Ross's building! She's back! She's back! Okay, wait there, I'll be over in a second. Got it!
HEY! I never have an off night ok although sometimes when I'm a little bloated I don't feel very sexy BUT EVEN THEN I'M BETTER THEN MOST!
That's a great story-can I eat it?
Ross bruises like a peach. He bruises like a peach.
Paper, snow, a ghost!
Well don't just say.
I, ah, I never said hate, I was very careful about that.
Bye bye Mike!/Cya mike!/Bye mike!/Bye bye now!
Oh come-look, when I was a kid my dad's company gave season tickets to the number one salesman every year, all right? My dad never won! Of course, he wasn't in the sales division, but still, I never ever, ever forgot that!
Hey, Monica, wow you've been in the bathroom for like a half-hour.
All right, uh... Oh hey, you've done this before Ross, well what did you say when you made up your vows?
Don't do it!
Why not?
yeah but she should remember sleeping with me I am very memorable, you guys know.
Oh that's on the house courtesy of Joey Tribbiani.
How little are they? I mean, are they like scary little?
Oh, no!
Sure, May...tember.
Look, it's okay, no, no, no, really, look um, I really appreciate this Pheebs, but I think I'm gonna have to go back to Estelle.
Pickle? Pickles make her sick. Giving her pickles is like giving me salad.
Here's how I know you didn't watch the tape, ok? If you had seen what was on this tape, believe me, you would have some comments. Alright, now remember, I got paid a lot of money for this and it only aired in Japan.
Oh man! They-they just redid my make-up!
Well then help me get it off! Plus, it smells really bad in here.
I had to get out of the apartment. Janine is like stretching all over the place. Y'know, everywhere I look she's like...
No-hey-no! If you don't want me to do it, I except that. I don't care about that. I just...I don't want you to be upset.
Man, this is a long drive! Are my eyes open? No!
Huh, you uh, you always wear panties?
Hey.
OK, alright, the people who threw the water.
Wait up!
It just seems so futile, you know ? All these women, and nothing. I feel like Superman without my powers, you know? I have the cape, and yet I cannot fly.
Yeah.
So, did you bring a little something for Ross?
Really?
Me?! Oh come on, man! You can't do this! Come on! I'm your hand twin!!
I look more like him than you do!
What?!
Listen uh, could you put Kathy on, I wanna apologize.
Ooooooooooh, I slept with you! And you obviously remember me Hey! I still got it. so were good. I'll let myself out.
Come on, I mean, you know me, you know...
That's what that was?! 'Cause that other thing? I thought you were on to something, but it did nothing for me.
Hey!
Woah, woah, woah, woah. Which sister?
Come on robot!
Wow!
See, now it's weird again.
Hey!
What?
I don't know. You uh, you got something for me?
Oh my God. You and Rachel?
"I thought I knew who the enemy was, but it was you all along."
I can't tell you that, no.
Chandler? Forty-five minutes? Well, something is not right. I just can't believe he would do this to Monica!
Oh, it went amazingly well!
Yeah?
I don't know. Why? Did you hear something?
Well, the part's mine if I want it.
Well, you must be new here. Why don't we get a table and I'll buy you a drink.
And-and-and not only that, I'm gettin' a new brain!!
Hard to tell, they're so tiny and upside-down. Wait, wait. They're walking away... they're walking away... No, no they're not, they're coming right at us! Run! Run!
Bye, Pheebs!
How do I look?
Ooh, I like that.
Oh, absolutely! You're talented and you're good looking.
Hey!
Well, we can talk about something else. What do you want to talk about? Vivisection? The Vasdeferens? The Vietnam War?
Hello?
Umm, hi.
Ross, how could you let this happen?
Oh my, would you look at that!
Hey, I'm with you. He even asked me if I thought you'd go out with him.
Oh.
Need a new table.
Yeah, for sure. Okay. Probably want the first thing to be, never open your eyes. Y'know, because you don't want to be doing something and then look up and see something you don't want to be seeing.
Who cares, we'll eat at the sink! Come on, let's play!
Oh, just er... you know, looking around. But you know what? This house... is great.
Hey!! I need to relax! Okay? I was working all day!
Look, come on you guys, you said you were gonna try! All right look, I came over here to invite you guys to a movie with me and Janine.
Hey, imagine if I never got fired off Days Of Our Lives! Oh-hey, there's Carol again!
And Chandler I can't believe I let you pay for this one. Thanks man.
Hey Chandler! Y'know that girl you went to college with who-who became a movie director?
Feminist issue. That's where I went!
Hey everybody, look who's here! You remember my grandmother!
What are you in love with her or something?
That guy's like a cartoon. What do you see in him anyway?
All right, come on look, Ross can take care of himself! It's not like he's...Chandler!
Hey.
It's a one-woman play called "Why don't you like me: a bitter woman's journey through life".
listen to this... I went out with this girl last night and half way through our date I realized I already slept with her.
I do! So much! I can't stop thinking about her! I can't sleep, I-
No no, uh, don't thank me for comin' in. Uh, at least let me finish. Uh, we could take the expressway but uh, this time of day you're better off taking the budge. You were goin' for the word bridge there weren't ya. I'll have a good day.
All right! Hey, who wants pizza?!
And for Ross, Mr. Sweet-tooth.
Well, you're timing couldn't be better. She's not my girlfriend anymore.
You hung up on the pizza place? I don't hang up on your friends.
What the hell am I supposed to do!
Come on Ross, be a good guy. Step up and do it!
Cool.
Hey.
What up?!
It's not that bad.
Okay, so will you meet with her?
Oh my God!
Who would you rather sleep with Monica or Rachel?
Okay!
Not a dad.
Dude, they're not objects.
Exellent dream score.
Oh! Ohh! Oh!!
Ooh... Not so good.
Oh, what are you gonna do? You're gonna fire me?
Okay.
Yeah-yeah-yeah, and they had that beer! That uh...
Hi, yeah, it's me. Oh, no no no, we're just friends. Yeah, I'm single. 25. An actor. Hello?
Oh, I got it! How about saying something like, "Monica...
Uh-huh!
You know what you should've done, you should have told yourself that little story.
Put your hands together.
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa, I-I-Hey! I did not go out with your wife! Okay? I went out with her!
Yeah, isn't that a cool name?
Come on! Admit it! That was the best nap you ever had!
So what? Being funny is Chandler's thing... You know, like Ross's thing is...
Dad, Ronni's here.
Hello.
Can we come it yet?! We're dying out here!
They were in his office.
Yep! There's always room for Jell-O...
Bye.
Hey!
No! No, you smell like a meadow. I'm sorry.
Ross!
Oh! I forgot you used to live here!
Whoa-whoa-whoa. What ah, what happened to playing the field?
Really? I can do it?
Well, actually it...
So? Did have sex, right?
Thanks sweetheart. Give me a little sugar here. Okay.
Oh! I see what happened. It's because I was trying to repel you. Right? Believe me, you'd feel a lot different if I turned it on.
see ordinarily I would talk to her, but my confidence is shaken did I sleep with her? Did I not sleep with her?
Guest.
They know you know.
Woo-hoo!!
This isn't the right room, sorry folks.
Uh huh, sure, yeah. How can you not remember me?
Oh my God! Oh! Hey, can I have an aquarium? And a sex swing?
Okay umm, I just came by to tell you that I...want to have dinner with you tonight. That's all.
She sure does. Why does she have a pink bow taped to her head?
Note the painterly lines and subtle impasto on this canvas. Monet painted quickly and usually outdoors as his elusive subject was light itself.
Yeah, you can get a Volvo. If that's what you really want.
Oh umm, my big scene is coming up. Big scene coming up.
You know you've been spitting on me?!
Oh, a wiseacre. . No, no, no, I understand you plan to support your wife by playing the piano? Isn't that kind of unstable?
Oh, no thanks, I got it. No I don't!
Foxy lady.
A little more, a little more. A little more... All right. Okay, all right, let's do this.
Oh, it was a lot of fun right up until Chandler got a finger in the eye!
Yeah I did!
Yeah, okay.
All right, but in the future...
Oh yeah. I rubbed a magazine on myself earlier.
What?
Hey!
Whoo-hoo!
All right. I'll give you one hint. Warren Beatty.
The vicar!
I don't want to drive all the way back by myself, I get so lonely. Oh-ooh! How about you come with me?
Hold on. Hold on. Rachel coming. Do...Something.
Pheebs, who's Evelyn Dermer?
Right, I guess. Alright, so see you at four.
Ya know, one of these times you're gonna really be naked and we're not gonna come over.
Okay. That's good. Okay, that give you a couple hours to prepare what you're gonna say. Good. Yeah. Don't you people ever knock?!
Those two only had each other!
Oh wow, what a beautiful name! What is it again?
Oh, a couple of nurses asked them out. Maybe they're with them.
Alright open your eyes.
I am on fire! Chandler : Listen...this is really nice. Do you... Did you write a cheque to Monica for two thousand dollars? Did Monica borrow money from you?
That's right, he almost could. Which is exactly how I got stuck there.
Hey! How you doin'?
No-no, I don't really have any money. Not yet, anyway...
Oh, ehm...I'm...I'm rehearsing my lines.They gave me a big romantic story on Days Of Our Lives. It's the first time my character's got one. I'm so nervous, you know, I really want it to be good!
No. No. No.
Noo-no-no, no, those are nicknames. I'm the chick and Chandler is the duck.
Yeah. Whew, it's hot with all of this stuff on. I ah, I better not do any, I don't know, lunges.
Ah. Slow swimmers?
No.
Better?
Okay, I'm in my sweat pants. Bring on the food! What's the matter?
'Cause I only have one quarter, and I think my time is about to-
Yeah, here we are. Uhh... I... I think I'm...falling in love with you.
Okay.
The hell with hockey, let's all do that!
Oh uh, okay. Yeah.
Sorry! Sorry, I'm late; sorry, I'm late! My duck and my chick and a fight, it-it was ugly.
Not in my head.
I was uh, I was thinking I might want to pick one of those babies up for myself, I might want to get one of those...
...No...
I'm not quite sure.
Well, y'know those special skills I have listed on my resume? I would love it would be great if one of those was true.
Look, it's too late, and I got an audition. I can't shop anymore! I...
I don't have a key, they took mine to give to you.
Okay! How you doin'?
No, hit me.
Monica, you have to do some damage control here, okay. 'Cause he's feeling like...
There you go! Keep going. Keep going!
I know! That's why they trashed me!
Why wouldn't ya? Erin is great! Then-then there's you guys.
So the ah, play's pretty great, huh?
Hey! I did not cry my eyes out!! Come on! It's like the end of an era! No more J-man and Channie's!!
It looks like a women's purse.
What?!
Hey, it's great having you back. You know, stay as long as you want, and when does she stop crying all night?
Thank you, thank you. How about I do something for you? Tomorrow, I'll bring you a hat, cover up the bald?
Oh, oh, I thought that was your character's name, you know, I thought you were like an Indian or something, you know with a...
Umm, yum!
Uhh, hey. Where's the other guy?
You got it!
Come on baby, don't go. Please? What do you say?
What?
Look forget it forget it... I can't do it.
Uhh, rub it?
So Monica, still going out with Dr. Boring huh?
Have you heard about a little something called, Not Making Girls Cry.
Yeah.
Whoa!! Now look, don't be just blurtin' stuff out. I want you to really think about your answers. Okay?
Ooooohh!
All right, what are we havin'?
Yeah.
Hey! Hey! Be careful around my Porsche!
Okay, look...
We don't need that wizard guy. We hit a couple of clubs, talked to some strangers, and uh, after this, we'll head down to the docks and see about that boat thing.
No.
Uh, I scratched it on the ATM machine down on the corner.
So, there was no miracle?!
Okay, listen, hey, Ross. Why don't you try to relax, okay? Maybe have a drink.
Come on, Chandler, I want this part soo much. Just one kiss, I won't tell anyone.
All right! All right! Enough! Enough! Enough!! Enough! You two go home! I-I-I gotta talk to Janine!
Yeah, and not put us in the middle.
Your chair?!
...Does the knuckle-cracking bother everybody?
No. Nope, I uh...I th-I thought it might be kind of a cool character thing. Y'know? He's uh, he's a face toucher.
I'm on top of the world, looking down on creation and the only explanation I can find...
It's my house-warming present for Monica and Chandler.
Yeah, she broke up with me.
Really? That's great! You and my sister, sittin' in a tree.
Hi.
No just, nobody press on my stomach.
: Ahhh, that's alright. Y'know, that's a tough hand to beat.
Yeah! Yeah sure, just long as it's handled tastefully and that barn is not too cold.
No! It's not okay! It's not okay at all!! You're dead inside!!
Yeah. But I thought that was because I put the whole thing on my hand and made it walk across the table.
They're here already?
Miracle!
Welcome to New York City! Or should I say "ghe deu flooff New York City"?
Thank you. Wait-wait-wait-wait, you see me again. Hang on, the guy's butt's blockin' me. There I am, there I am, there I am, there I am, there I am...
Good luck. And I'm still right!
I miss this.
Look, we're not throwing it out! I built this thing with my own hands!
Charity.
Oh dear God!
Really?
I'm sorry man, I tired, I really did.
That was ME!
Oh yeah, yeah, she's great, but... I kinda got the feeling that she was sort of... coming on to me. And I definitely would get the part if I would've... you know... if I would have sent the Little General in.
I can see why, nice shirt!
Anybody gonna eat that?
Oh, now it's a spare room?
Yeah-Hey, don't worry, she's a terrific girl. And hey listen, could you do me a favor? When she comes out could you just mention that I'm not looking for a serious relationship; that'd be great.
Look, Rachel, we don't have to do this.
Hey, this isn't about juice anymore, alright man.
Well why don't you just reach out and take his trampoline.
Heeeyy! Hey!
Thursday? But that's Halloween.
"I can't. Oh, I want to, long pause, but I can't."
So but everything is normal.
This is unbelievable Phoebs, how can you be married?
All right, I'll see you in the morning.
Why are they doing this?
Oh! Hey! Thank God you guys are here!
Hey! Joey Tribbiani! I'm here! I'm here!
Oh come on! Just pick one! Between Monica, Phoebe, Chandler, and Ross if you had to, if you had to, who would you punch?
No, no, no... what do... you can't do that to him!
All right well, y'know...I guess we know what we have to do to get down.
Uuuh.. yes, they are my stuffed clams.
I like although!
I will not take this abuse.
I guess I'm going to have to come up with a really good reason why I wasn't there. The producers are going to be so mad at me. They sat us all down yesterday and said "Everyone has to be there at 6:00 AM sharp, that means you Tribbiani." Like.. like I was some kind of idiot.
Angela? Joey Tribiani. Listen, what are ya doing tonight. I know your seeing that guy I was thinking maybe you could bring him.....Hello? Hello?
Nighty-night!
Yeah.
That's all right. Hey you guys, you know what's going to be great about the fishing trip this year? When my dad gets me out in the middle of the lake and gives me that, "Joey, what are you doing with your life?" stuff. I can say, "Well, I'm doing a movie with Charlton Heston dad. What are you doing with your life?"
My mom will.
Come on, I need your help here.
Huh.
46. Wow! Who's well educated now, Mr. I-forgot-ten-states?
Well, why don't you tell me what you're supposed to be! Huh? Because I sure as hell can't figure it out! I talk to you and it's nothin'. You look at me, and nothin'. Nothing.
And-and you won't blame us for any damage?
Look it's not that bad. So what, it blocks a little of your door, a little of my door.
Oh come on Ross! Hey Ross-Ross don't...
Oh man! Now she's gonna start all over! We're never gonna get to introduce the hot girls to the new world!
No.
Oh, don't worry, it's not a cat.
Hi.
I have actually not heard of that.
Rach! Hey! It's fine! You're at Joey's!
Well this is noodle soup and uh, I've been working with tomato. But that's okay, no problem. No problem. Hmm, noodle soup.
Oh! It all looks so beautiful: the turkey, the stuffing...
Well, I figured we're in another country, so it doesn't count.
Hey!
Oh uh, ordinarily I would love too, but I am just swamped right now.
Hey!
Dude! He's right there!
Done.
Nope.
No, no, no, don't you dare bail on me. The only reason she's goin' out with me is because I said I could bring a friend for her friend.
That's the title! Yeah! Y'know they really lucked out that the initials spell cheese.
AWCH! That's why.
Let's see what else he'll do!
Oh, Urse...
No, I gotta wear this thing for a couple weeks.
But I'm bursting with u-hu!
I just have one question!
Really?
Yeah, they're not coming.
Yeah.
I guess it could've been, I didn't really look at it. Y'know, I just wiped it on Chandler's coat and got the hell out of there.
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa-whoa! We could have our own show! Y'know we could clap our hands together people will love it! Huh? And-and-and I wrote a song for us! This hand is your hand! This hand is my hand! Oh wait, that's your hand! No wait, it's my hand!
Hey, Pheebs!
Yeah.
I love you too.
Well, no, not exactly! All right, look, I, I wasn't trying to save Ross. Okay? My sandwich was next to Ross. All right? I was, I was trying to save my sandwich.
Me too.
Here, I brought you some flowers.
Sure, I know lots of girls.
No-no-no I've seen it happen, you-you get a rapport going with a woman but somehow you manage to kill it. What's your secret?
Alright, now you say something.
Well, I'd like to think there was something for everyone. Look, I know you're casting for this new show...
Whoa! Is this porn? What did I do? I must've hit something on the remote.
Ahoy!
No, I-I-I wasn't making fun of you, honestly, I-I think you were great in those commercials.
What's a matter Ross? What you're nervous about your speech?
Plastic spoons. Great.
No!
All right relax, look I'll pay you with the money from the acting job I am definitely gonna get thanks to you.
The reactor's gonna blow in three seconds, we're never gonna make it!
Pheebs, you can't do that. The casting director doesn't talk to friends, she only talks to agents.
Okay.
Well look, I'm breaking up with Katie so I had to put on some extra padding. Y'know? I mean, if she hits me when she's happy, can you imagine how hard she's gonna hit me when I tell her I'm taking away the Joey love?
No, I-I just heard lunch. But yeah, I can go. Sure!
Well that's true. And I am only naked in one scene. Plus it sounds really great. My character's catholic and he falls in love with this Jewish girl. Who run away together and they get caught in this big rainstorm. So we go into this barn and undress each other and hold each other. It's really sweet and-and tender.
No! No! No! No! No! How you doin'?! How you doin'-Damnit Carl! Go wait in the hall!
Look, I'm telling you if I put my hand on my stomach right here it doesn't hurt that bad.
Hey.
Because it's impossible to find her apartment! She lives in some like of hot girl parallel universe, or something.
Well, have-have you told him how you feel?
Oh-oh, hey-hey, Kate! Listen I want you to meet everybody. Everybody, this is Kate.
We just got the message.
But only in the moment. So do ya wanna kiss again?
No more jam?!
PBS telethon.
So? Who would you rather have kiss you, me or Chandler?
Hello New York!
You won't boss me around anymore?
Right. Ok, ok, uh, ducks is heads, because ducks have heads.
Yeah, and when you do, he'll be lucky to have you.
Err...Well I...Know how much you used to make and I know how much your rent is.
Wh-what?! Why?!
18, uh?
Oh thanks. Thanks. It was great meetin' ya. And listen if any of my friends gets married, or have a birthday, or a Tuesday...
We good? Yeah? Good? Once again, I pronounce you husband and wife. Now kiss her again.
Oh my God! Congratulations Ross, because Chandler, you've been Bamboozled!
Hey!
It is me! It's a musical version of Tale of Two Cities. So I think I'm gonna sing New York, New York, and ah, oh I left My Heart in San Francisco.
Why not?!
All right look, y'know how-y'know how when you're dating someone and you don't want to cheat on them, unless it's with someone really hot?
All right, Ross!
All right! Westminster Abbey! Hands down, best Abbey I've ever seen. Hey! Okay. What do you think of the Abbey, Chandler?
So, we're having fun, right?
How about a scone on the house baby?
Probably Monica and Chandler.
Whoa, I'm not done.
I gotta go check something over here.
Okay, Ross, I realise that you didn't expect to walk in and see that, but.. Let me explain, okay?
I'll do it!! It'll get the casserole stink off of mine.
I know! I mean it's not like we weren't cool about it.
Yeah well that's because uh...I stayed in my room. Yeah, you don't want to look in my hamper.
Relax Ross, we'll be ready. It only takes us two minutes to get dressed.
Hey, cut him some slack. It was Chandler's idea.
Well I got stuff going on in here if you wanna feel.
We can't do that.
Hold on, you-you knew?
A four and a nine.
Vomiting stories are funny...
"You know!"
Well, I'm- I'm showering.
Well check it out, I was with this really hot girl who just moved in right across the street!
He's doin' some thinkin'!
Okay. "Hey, Timmy, I've got a surprise for you."
Hey! As soon as it stops raining we have got to go snorkeling! Some kid told me about the sea turtle and, if you blow bubbles in its face, it chases ya!
We could get that Everest video though.
Yeah, they said I acted too much with it. I told everybody about this! Now everybody's gonna go to the theatre, expecting to see me, and...
No, but if you're willing to cook naked, then you might be willing to dance naked. And then...
: Pheebs, have you ever been bitten by a hungry Italian?
All right, look, I'm not proud of this, ok? Well, maybe I am a little.
Yeah!! I call that London style.
Ok-ay. I just, I can't believe you're calling me?
Thanks. Do you get a lot of guys in here?
Ooh ooh ooh ooh, there's no room for milk!
Make the transfer!
Not like we used to. Remember? You and me used to be inseparable. Y'know now it's like...things are different.
No, as part of the audition. See, I'm up for this part of this guy, who the main guy kisses.
Bye!
The Unbearable Likeness of Being!
Yeah.
Come on Treeger, don't say that. You just ahh, you just need more practice. Here, come on, let's ahh, let's try it again. Come on. Plus, it was, it was probably mostly my fault, anyway. I mean, y'know, I'm not really that comfortable dancing with a- We-he!! Hey!
No. But I got Knicks tickets for you, me, and Chandler.
Hey, wouldn't be cool if our duck and chick had a little baby? We could call it Chuck.
Is something wrong?
All right!!! Okay!! All right! Okay-okay, I gotta get started on my speech! Oh, wait a minute, Internet ministers can still have sex right?
Hey, but at least you got that cool, pregnant lady glow.
Yeah.
Yeah!
Hey!
Hey.
Hey, what's up?
I can do an English accent?! That baby's going on my resume!
No, I had sex in high school.
Hey, that guy's going home with more than a note!
Dude!
Oh, ah, tour guide at the museum. Yeah, Ross got it for me.
Hey, Mr. Bing. That uh, hotel you stayed at called. Said someone left an eyelash curler in your room.
Listen, I ah, I know it's a longshot. But, by any chance did she find that funny?
No, not that one. We're trying to figure out who to bring to the Knicks game tonight, we have an extra ticket.
Ah!! Okay! Eyes open at all times! Oh, hey, how do we decide where we... y'know each would, y'know be?
Hey!
Tribbiani.
So...
Y'know, when we talked about face to face, I don't think we thought it all the way through.
Oooh, what you got there?
Check it out, Giants-Cowboys.
Oh hey whoa-whoa, don't worry. Okay. When my sisters were pregnant they got every weird feeling in the book, it was always nothing.
Oh.
Yeah, so, uh, so, uh, what's the deal with this father guy, I mean, if someone was havin' my baby somewhere, I'd wanna know about it, you know?
What is it?
Hey.
Why not? Come on! Just, just close your eyes and tell me what you'd like to be doing right now.
Yeah? Really? No one's home?
Well, then it wouldn't be a secret. So yeah, that would be okay. Yeah. Yeah!
Hey Pheebs, guess who we saw today.
Geez, sounds like you should be going on this date!
Oh, you're not taking her with you tonight?
Oh, I do. How you doin?
Argh!
Hey man, you feeling any better?
Not like him, per-se, just not un-like him.
No-no-no, please-please Chandler I-I-I would owe you so much!
Oh hey Rach!
Because! You're mean on the boat!
Hey. I'm here for my eyebrow appointment.
Re! Re! Then I can watch that! Rewind it! Rewind it!
Well, Chandler's old roomate was Jewish, and these are the only candles we have, so... Happy Chanukah, everyone.
I'm so sorry.
Yeah. Uh, oh, OH, the best part, c'mon. Heh?
Exactly.
Good morning.
Hey!!
Hey!
Oh uh, I don't know the boat way to say this, but uh never!
Oh, you are the best friends anyone has ever had.
Who's seven?
One of the virus victims called in sick, so Cathy recommended me and boom, I'm dying on the gurney. Oh Ross, Marcel just finished his last scene if you want to go down there and say goodbye.
You got to go on a ride along?!
No, no. See, you and Drake are having a fight.
Do you want me to want you to care?
Hey!
Yes!
That's a really long time.
Oh, man, she loved it! She's over there showing Monica and Rachel right now.
Yeah. With a bite! Gee-e-e-eez!
Hey, Monica, who would yours be?
I don't know. It's-it's just...lately, I've been feeling... Okay, here's what it is... You know what? I feel a lot better, thanks!
Damnit!
Let's play Bamboozled!
He hooked up!! Tell us about her!
You may not kiss the bride. So, I guess by the powers vested in my by the state of New York and the Internet guys, I now pronounce you husband and wife. Oh wait! Do you take each other?
Yeah, I thought you knew that.
Sure. I went through the exact same thing with Alicia Mae Emory... The waiting, the wandering... Then one day... I get that call from Toys "R" Us... She was in stock!
Who was that?
Yeah.
What?!
I'm not talking to you! You broke my fridge!
Yes, but y'know what? It doesn't matter who knows what. Now, enough of us know that we can just tell them that we know! Then all the lying and the secrets would finally be over!
Hey-hey-hey-hey, if you're gonna start with that stuff we're outta here.
What if I smack my head on the concrete?
I don't know! I haven't totally decided how to talk on my boat yet.
Oh, they're so cute! Now, what, what kinds are they?
Whoah, boy, hockey was a big mistake! There was a whole bunch of stuff we could've done tonight!
Can I offer you a drink?
Hola, amigos!
I can't. I keep seeing it the good way.
No you won't. Look he knows he did a terrible thing and I believe him, he's sorry. But, you've got one more apology to make, all right, you've got to apologize to Mary-Angela.
All right, all right, all right, all right, you wanna know what I do when I take resume shots?
Oh? Oh! Okay! Okay! Let's hear their plan! Now, what's the future look like for Dina and Bobby?
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What about you, having those babies for your brother? Talk about selfish!
Yeah. Sure.
So what.
Fine, I'll rent a car and drive...! Ross, you have to get that job!
Oh, and Mississ-Pete is?
No, I'm alright man. Really.
I totally don't know what you're talking about.
Here you go. Let me ask you a question.
For Ross.
We're the guys.
Hey, finished my recommendation. Here. And I think you'll be very, very happy. It's the longest I ever spent on a computer without looking at porn.
Oh hi!
No. No. No. She lives on the third floor, eighth apartment from the left.
Feminine.
Welcome to America.
All right, we'll start with...apples.
Ooh, yeah, I'm not going anywhere for a while.
So Pheebs, where are you doing all, your bell ringing?
Sort of.
Good.
Oh, see that's where you're wrong. Whatever it is I can do it. And if didn't see it up there, just-just try me.
