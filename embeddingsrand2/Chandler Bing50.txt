Well, hello!
That's a relatively open weave and I can still see your... nipular areas.
Good, good. Listen, heh, I dunno what Shelley told you about me, but, uh... I'm not.
Yeah, listen, Joey isn't gonna be here tonight so why don't you come over and I'll let you uh, feel my bicep. Or maybe more.
Where are Bill and Colleen?
It can't happen like this. Okay? I'll meet you back at the hotel.
Okay y'know what, because you said that, I'm not putting out tonight.
You slept with somebody three hours after you thought you broke up. I mean bullets have left guns slower!
Mento?
I just didn't want to tell you in front of them.
Oh, he works in the Fine Foods division.
So what'd you do?
She's really going to love this, you know? The bottom line is I want her to have it, even if I don't get to be the one who gives it to her.
Huh.
Didn't you used to call it the Little Major?
All right look, I'm changing it to 50 bucks, or your best offer.
Monica.
You're not gonna die an old maid, maybe an old spinster cook.
Mazel tov!
Yeah, it's annoying, isn't it?
Can you hear that?
Alright! Just follow my lead!
Y'know what else I can't believe? I had to kiss Phoebe and Rachel every time I left a room, I mean it's too bad they didn't see us having sex.
What?!
No, no, no, no, no, no No. Monica, it's Sunday morning. I'm not running on a Sunday.
No, I let him win-Ross!
Monica, there are no words... There are no words! This should not be this hard!
You understood that?
Yeah, I wanna go to babe.
Okay, no problem, just remember to wake us up before you go-go.
All right buddy, way to go!
Hey!
Are you, are you high?
Bye..... ridiculously dull Bobby.
What's wrong with you?
Like, when you're cooking a steak.
Y'know, it wasn't that big a deal. He just balled up socks... and a melon...
Oh, she's regional Vice President; She's... just below me.
I'm just saying that sometimes we like to do stuff that costs a little more.
Ok!
Okay, you get her in here. You bolt the door. I'll be in the closet.
Sure!
What's in the bag?
Fine. Oh no!
With extra pulp?
Yep.
Oh wow, I hope you don't take this the wrong way but, I know we had plans to meet up tonight and, ugh, I'm just kinda worried about what it might do to our friendship.
So you don't have the cameras?!
Yes, yes, we did, thanks to Vidal Buffay.
Glass, sand, whatever.
