: Oh well this is the only one they had at our video store, but they did have something called crocodile killers. Or does it always have to be sharks?
Y'know, I never saw that.
I just can't stand you being here all the time.
Look at you, you won't even look at him.
Oh my pleasure. Okay, I'm afraid I've got some bad news. Phoebe!
You're kidding! Where? Where?
Well, let's just say it's not the first time you've stolen my thunder.
Okay, hold on a sec.
Are you kidding? This is where they get out stains! Okay? This is like Disneyland for me. I'm-I'm gonna be over here watching the dance of the clean shirts.
No fair. I don't even have one. How come they get two?
All right, that I'll retract. But I stand by my review, I know food and that wasn't it. You're marinara sauce tasted like tomato juice! You should serve it with vodka and a piece of celery.
Did you just flick me?
Okay, what's going on with you?
Um, and, well there's the.. the the small matter of...
What? When was this?
Yeah, apparently, they're pretty good seats.
I know. Where do you wanna go eat?
Like a month?
Hey, aren't you up next?
Chandler.
I'm getting married next!!
Thank you. Come meet my friends. This is uh, Phoebe.
Ok, thanks for coming, I hope you guys had fun.
Well, y'know how I always wanted to go out with Chip Matthews in high school?
Phoebe moved out.
Yes. Well I got his machine and I left a message. But it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, because you know it was like a casual, breezy message. It was breezy! Oh God, what if it wasn't breezy?
Lewis Posin! He was my best friend in fifth grade, and-and then one day I asked him to be my boyfriend and he said no. Do you know why?
"Hi I'm Rachel, is my sweater too tight? No? Oh, I'd better wash it and shrink it!"
Look, Phoebe!
I can't find garbage bags!
OK. Just for a little while.
Oh, my goodness, they've all gotten so big!
Yeah, and in the long version, I dump him for telling people the short version.
5 6 7 8!
Uh well that depends, how are things with Phoebe?
Okay, we'll start with the building. You guys take the first and second floor, Phoebe and I'll take third and fourth.
Oh! Enough! A monkey could have made 'em!
What the hell happened?!
I know!
Why don't you just weigh out the good stuff about the relationship against the bad stuff. I mean that's what I did when I first weighing stuff.
Ok.
Yes! Absolutely. Okay? Look, you'll know it's mine because on the right cup, the lacey part, there's a very noticeable rip.
Honey, as we get closer to the wedding, is there anything that you would like to talk about or share?
Hey! How'd the audition go?!
Ohhh, ooohhh... you are on a roll, mister!
We're kidding!
Oh... what does that mean?
You had a bathroom break at 2030. Pee on your own time, Mike! . Now, in regard to the toast, okay, you wanna keep them short, nothing kills a rehearsal dinner like long speeches. Okay. You just get in, do your thing and get out!
Hey.
Hey Rach, come on! We're gonna be late for the eye doctor appointment!
Really well. Yeah. Surprisingly well. Yeah, she didn't cry. She wasn't angry or sad.
I'm changing out of this.
I'm making cookies for Erica. And oh, by the way, we have to leave for the airport soon, her plane comes in about an hour.
Oh my God!
Well, I thought this would be a great opportunity to use up all the food that I don't want to move to the new house with me! So, enjoy: smoke oyster casserole with a breakfast cereal crust, kidney beans in their own juices, and for dessert, a questionable orange.
I hope she's OK.
There were only twelve.
You don't want to know what tonight was.
Christmas cookie?
C'mon up.
Or "Win, Lose or Draw".
No fair. I don't even have one. How come they get two?
Hey, I could've had you if I wanted you.
Oh my God.
You made a joke right? So I laughed.
It's okay. It's okay. Just pretend that it didn't happen! Okay? No one needs to know! I mean, Phoebe's not an official ballplayer! I mean, only official ballplayers can drop the ball!
Somebody likes you!
Oh My God!
Relax! It's Phoebe! Not you!
Joey, we had a deal. That-that's why you're here! I've got to fire you!
Besides, it takes the focus off the hat.
Yes! All right, y'know what? Why don't we start with a practice run? Okay?
Y'know, no point in dragging it out. Dragging out the long process of you moving out and us not living together anymore.
Well, not anymore.
But what kind of a sick bastard wants to do it in front of a deer?
That's your call.
Would you ever be a surrogate for anyone?
Not now.
That's the surprise!
Oh my God! You are gonna love me so much! I felt really bad about the whole bachelorette party thing, so tonight you're gonna have a bachelor party.
You're right.
See? They're as different as night and... later that night.
Oh, but wait I do have a globe.
You kissed a guy?!! Oh my God.
What?
What kind of karate is that?
Bye plates!
Look , I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have.
Well, umm, Walker was looking for this big bus load of kids.... All right, I get your point.
Not a basset, a bassinet.
All right baby, come on! Yes! Yes! I am on fire!
Ohhhh!
Really?
Oh good, Lenny and Squigy are here.
I'm really gonna miss you.
Alright, let's see..
Y'know what, don't tell us. We'll just wait until Chandler gets home, because it'll be more fun that way.
All right... you're right. We're sorry. Now let's wake up Emma and get the fun time started!
I'm just so glad you got to see the babies.
Phoebe!
Isn't it.
Hey, have you guys eaten, because uh, Richard and I just finished and we've got leftovers... Chicken and potatoes... What am I wearing?...Actually, nothing but rubber gloves.
Well there's not much we can do.
Sure, I love this part!
I love you.
So what, he's a little older, big deal, I mean he's important to me. Ya know if you ask him, he might take you on his Jag.
It took me 28 years to find one man that I wanna spend my life with, if I have to wait another 28 years then, I'll be 56 before I can have a baby, and that's just stupid.
Uh, you left out the stupid part.
Okay. Umm...
And the eye!
Okay, try it.
God, look what I found in the drain.
Joey, she was listing the countries she's done it in.
Hey, stay out of this, Chandler! This is between me... and ME!
Well, I'm sorry, but Chandler and I could really use a weekend away. You know, to reconnect... emotionally.
Oh, look! Acting for Beginners! Want to feel good about yourself?
She's asleep.
That can't be your father.
Oh, then you do know it. So um what kind of things do you write about?
Oh, you can't show Phoebe this! She hates those corporate massage chains.
It was Michelle. It was definitely Michelle.
Oh really, you want to talk about quality? Have you heard of a key? It's what some people sing in.
I'm there!
No.
I'm gonna go across the hall to check on the yams.
Ross, Rachel promised it would be over by now. We seriously have to go, if we want to get to Vermont. I called them and the last train leaves in a half hour.
Oh my God, you're a freak.
I can't do it!
Not the way they're doing it. What, what happened? How did she die?
I won't know what I would do without you.
Oh my god, Joey, for all we know this guy could be horribly...
Hey!
Hey.
Okay, Okay, All right. What if we got both houses? Huh? We can turn this house into a guest house.
Hi.
We said six!
Who is it?
Say it louder, I don't think the guy all the way in the back heard you!
And! We also have speaker phone.
And his puppet too.
Alright, but I'm very excited about this OK, so you gotta promise you won't get all big-brothery and judgmental.
I don't have an atlas.
Okay!
Hey! There you are!
Cowboy boots? I've never worn cowboy boots in my whole life!
Twelve dollars an hour.
Joey, what's it like on a movie set, huh? Do you have a dressing room? Do you have a chair with your name on it?
They baked it. I can't take this anymore. I'm gonna call a meeting tonight, I'm gonna fire you tonight.
Well, not... worried, just... wondering.
What have you heard me sing?
I'm sure everything's fine. Has her water broke yet?
Six o'clock!
Well, it's getting late.
Ok, all right. It was an accident, I swear, all right. I was putting on my jacket, and the thing, and the lamp, and it broke.
Yes it's true.
Thank you. All right, now who else do you want to invite?
It's so good, isn't it?
Thank you.
Because Chandler still has feelings for you!
Oh it's not big, not at all, you know, kinda the same lines as, say, oh I don't know, having a third nipple.
Well, it's done about two minutes before it looks like that.
Wow! A star! I know you all hate me and-and I'm sorry, but I don't care.
No, I haven't seen him.
No!
Huh?
Oh my God! You don't know me at all!
Am I doing here? Why? Surprised to see me? Ross brought me. How do you like that?!
007 gets all the ladies.
Come on!
Seriously, what is this supposed to mean?
Wow! You are really fast!
We're just two people who find each other very attractive. Right?
Here you go! What do you think about centerpieces?
Yeah, but I'm the only one related by blood.
Hi.
Okay, how much?
Ross, I thought you were over this.
What's going on?
...Yeah. Yeah, I do.
He had to go, there's a deer just outside eating fruit from the orchard.
Yeah, I saw him waiting for an elevator.
One-Mississippi. Two-Mississippi. Three-Mississippi.
Oh my God, oh my God. Call me on the phone!
Rachel, you say you're sorry or your sweater gets it.
Hey Rachel!
Happy birthday dad.
Hey!
Nothing. I just think it's nice when we're all here together.
So! He'll understand!
Phoebe, good work.
Where is everybody? They're forty-five minutes late!
Oh my God, she's not gonna like the chicken that night either is she?!
Phoebe why don't you just call her? You obviously want to.
Okay, but wouldn't it be easier if you had to tell me something that you could tell me.
Well, my breasts are going to get bigger weather you like it or not! And you know what? It's not just my breasts. My ass is going to get bigger too.
Honey, I'm not returning them. Okay? I mean I-I know they cost a lot, but I'm going to wear them all the time. You'll see. Besides, I love the compliments. I mean, have you ever had something so beautiful everyone wanted it?
Phoebe, Sandra's mad at you too. It-it doesn't bother you?
I feel really sad that we're not...really there anymore.
I've still got it!
Wow, is that Michelle?
You're kidding!
Look at you with all the guys!
I'm sorry honey, but we're gonna take you shopping. It's gonna be fine.
Honey I can't even imagine how hard this must be for you. But, I don't want you to lose Joey over it. And right now he just needs to know that you're still his friend.
Ohh!
Did you not hear where my head was? Come on! Come on we're a team! We're in this together!
Oh, that's great!!
She picked Rachel. I mean, she tried to back out of it, but it was obvious. She picked Rachel.
And y'know what, I just realised, in the last year I've only gone out with two guys, Richard and Julio. You gotta help me out here, you gotta set me up, you gotta get me back in the game.
Six? I just had it for one night. It's three.
Wait, now so you joined the gym?
So what, you're not the only one. I mean, half the time we don't know where we're going. You've just gotta figure at some point it's all gonna come together, and it's just gonna be... un-floopy.
Hey.
So Don, what-what other restaurants do you like?
Okay, let's go!! Let's hit the road!!
Joey...he's not even thinking about going after Rachel!
I've gotta tell you, Bob is terrific.
My god, if I had a nickel for every guy I wish I hadn't..., but this is about your horrible mistake.
It's unbelievable! I-I can't believe that sign didn't work!
Great!
Chandler, why are you doing this?
Bye.
What?
Ross, I'm gonna use yours, okay?
What happened? You still have the Monica wedding fund don't you?
Uh-huh.
So uh, Joey and Chanlder, I, I think it's time that you take Dr. Greene over to your place.
We took a cab. Did you guys walk?
That counts!
G'bye, Nana.
Give it to me.
That was a long night.
You got it.
No-no-no, wait! We need something old!
Really?!
Y'see, this is where you'd use that 'hello' word we talked about.
Why not?
Um, I'm not actually Amish.
Let's see. Congress is debating a new deficit reduction bill... the mayor wants to raise subway fares again... the high today was forty-five... and- oh, teams played sports.
I like 'em.
No! Umm well, some people say that Oysters are an aphrodisiac.
Ooh, this always happens.
Really? I'd say 3 to 4.
Monica Gellerrr.
Uh, yeah.
Because you're on my team! And my team always wins!
Ok, I'm sensing that this is some kind of word play, because you are pink with barely controlled glee.
Nobody wants to do it? All right, I'll do it myself.
I-I'm the head chef. I-I can't get promoted.
So do you guys gonna come over tomorrow? I'll make that pasta thing I was telling you about.
I eat by myself in the alley because everybody hates me.
All right.
Oh, just do it!!
Well, bye for me too.
No! But I know exactly what I'm going to say.
I promise. Hey, speaking of together, how about we send out a holiday card this year?
You just carry that around?
That's right. You're making a commitment and that's the same, whether you do that at the Plaza or, where are you gonna do it?
Fine! If you want me to wear the boots, I'll wear the boots. In fact, I'll go into my room right now and y'know try the outfit on.
Oh no! What's the matter?
What?! I thought he'd love it! His favorite kid's book was the Velveteen Rabbit!
Congratulations, I think youve found the worlds thinnest argument.
Whoa!
Okay, good luck!
We left Joey alone with the food! Yep! Yep, I knew it! There he is... feeding stuffing to a dog!
He probably wants you back because you're right for the job.
What don't you just calm down Phoebe! All right?! Why don't you just get all your facts before you run around telling everybody that you're the only hot couple!!
Hey sweetie.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You know what, the way you did it was just fine.
Yeah. Don't do the dance.
Okay, this isn't working. I'm still awake and now I have to pee.
She and Phoebe took the stripper to the hospital.
Oh-ho! But not in here! Can't eat 'em in bed, remember? No crumbies!
This doesn't mean anything, does it?
Okay.
Does that smell bother you?
Ohh, of course we are! We left it up to fate. If we were supposed to get married there would be a clear-cut sign.
No way!
Okay.
Yes.
It's goin' great. Right on schedule. Got my little happy helpers.
Okay! The movers will be here in 11 hours. Rachel has not packed. Now, everybody has to help! Chandler, we're gonna start with...
Oh, well. Now that I'm here I might as well help you with the cleaning and organizing! Just happen to have my label maker!
That's true! I knew I married you for a reason!
Ah, yeaaah!
That's okay.
Woo-hoo, geeek!
Not that bad? Did you hear the hammer story?
Phoebe, stop writing about us!
I'm sorry. But not that sorry, 'cause you don't have to live with it. Um, we have a reservation under the name Chandler Bing.
Hey, check me out, I'm a slut!
Okay. Could the waiters gather around to hear tonight's specials? Okay, first there is a Chilean Sea Bass prepared with a Mango relish on a bag-Why is nobody writing these down?
That's right. That's right. And that is why you can't stay here tonight. And probably why you shouldn't come to the wedding.
Sure.
Oh May 15th.
This is unbelievable.
Okay. It's Emma.
Hey!
Hey!
No! That's where we keep the canned goods! Have you completely forgotten everything you learned at orientation?
Oh! Me too!
I wanna say good-bye at the car!
Well then, y'know what? I care about you to much to watch you hurt yourself like this. So if you have to do this, then you're gonna have to do it without me.
Jeez! What is with you?
I mean, was it Gina?
Oh no it's not, no it's not. It's a first date. I'm sure that nothing is gonna...
I know, I've been looking at those doors, they look pretty sound proof, don't you think?
And say what? "You owe me a goodbye", I mean, he's got more pride than that.
That's terrible!
Just breathe, breathe.. that's it. Just try to think of nice calm things...
Oh, you're right.
Thanks.
Break!
He just left.
Thank you.
Well, maybe she thought that with all of your history it could be, you know, implicit.
Hey guys!
He is the man in the black dress.
I just told my Mom I'd cater a party for her.
No I didn't!
Hi!
What if I turn out the lights?
I need to talk to you.
Ross has never checked out of a room a minute before he had to.
Joey, stop hitting on her! It's her wedding day!
All right, I'm out of oven space. I'm gonna turn on Joey's. Please, watch him! Do not let Joey eat any of the food!
Is it better than the other salmon mousse?
But I didn't.
I know. How could we have let this happen?
What? It's still going on.
Y'know what, I've got to walk out of here right now, 'cause getting over you is the hardest thing that I have ever had to do. I don't think I could do it again.
Oh, honey, can you make sure we get a King size bed!
Oh no!
Then why are you smoking?
I'm sorry, I'll give it back to you.
Oh, come on.
Joey, that paper's like a year old!
Break.
Yeah, but that's pigs not people!
I don't know what to say. We shouldn't have lied to you.
Really?!
I can't go to lunch!!
Well, I think so.
Thank you! You haven't said anything... 3rd Customer: Actually I do have one small complaint.
Hi sweetie!
Are we still on that?
Oh my God, you can't even see where the Titanic hit it.
Oh that's so great!
It's not ok to do it in a doctor's office but it is ok to do it in a parked car behind a Taco Bell?
Yes, please!
No! Everything's cold. The turkey's dried out and the... the stuffing is all soggy.
Well it wasn't that many guys. I mean, if you consider how many guys there actually are, it's a very small percentage.
This is Phoebe.
Hey.
What's wrong with PBS?
'kay.
Then why would he say it?
Fat?!
Now?
Are you sure you're okay?
Okay, now that everything's wrapped up here, I think I'm, I'm gonna go do my laundry.
Okay. Let's bring it in.
Yeah, y'know, but something like salmon which would be so much more elegant than the chicken. And, you wouldn't have to worry about the salmonella. But of course with salmon you'd have to worry about the chickenella... So, I can't wait to see this place you're getting married!
Oh, Rach! Rach! Umm hey, could you do me a favor and would talk to Chandler's dad and try to keep him away from Chandler's mom?
Not Chandler, just Joey.
Alright, I tell you what, I'll give this to you now if you can tell me where we keep the dustpan.
Oh Joey, look, we know you're having a hard time with this, but we really, we love it here.
So, how'd the lasagne go over? Really?! Good. So you owe me three pretty things. Yeah, I've been thinking a lot about you too. I know. It's hard this whole platonic thing. It's a word!
Weren't you nine?!
There are no tickets on the nightstand!
Phoebe, you were supposed to take that back!
You still have feelings for me don't you?
Pete's breaking up with me.
It's okay! It's good! It's good. It's a disease!
Hey guys! Hey!
Hey you.
I'm on top of the world, looking down on creation and the only explanation I can find, is the wonders I've found ever since...
So, do you guys wanna come and eat dinner at the restaurant sometime in the next few weeks?
Umm...
That was me and Ross.
Alright. If you guys don't want it to be special, fine. You can throw any kind of party you want.
She was like 30, dark hair, attractive.
No, no! Give it to me!
Well Ross, you be careful now. You don't want to get a reputation as y'know Professor McNailshisstudents.
Well, high school was not my favourite time.
She's bluffing!
Look at these authentic fake medals. I tell ya, mom's gonna be voted best dressed at the make-believe military academy.
Why are you reading this? You hate this kind of stuff.
From here to the airport?
There's the man I married!!
Ross, can I?
I love you.
What do you do with your money now?
Okay, Phoebe you know what you're doing right?
I can't believe this is taking so long. How are you doing?
Y'know what, that's fine, maybe you haven't grown up, but I have.
Okay, well, stop staring at them.
Dammit, dammit, dammit!
We're waiting for the adoption lady, but, hey, I'm glad you're here. I was cleaning this morning and I found this . I don't know if you wanna use it, but...
That's okay.
It meant nothing! Okay? After all this time, how can you not trust me?
They're my pants!
I love you too Chandler.
Hmm?
Newark airport. Why, where are you?
Rach, wait, I can cancel...
Oh, um, I don't know if that's a good idea.
Okay! Okay! Okay! We'll see you in about 3 to 4 hours.
Oh gosh.
Okay, this one I like!
Isn't this great?
We're with you. We got it.
Rachel, he like, totally changed time.
Oh, did you do a picture of Emma?
After the snap!
Your a poet and don't know it.
...in this day and age how dumb do you have to be to get pregnant?
How was that possible?
Wait a minute. That wasn't a hard eight! Last night I rolled a hard eight.
Oh crap!
Wait wait! I can't sing in front of all these people.
Thanks.
Oh, you look so great.
Bye! Ten bucks says, I never see that woman again in my life.
Ennnh.
You wanna what?!
Oh, put him on!
Joey! Now that you're here...
Ok, these were unbelievably expensive, and I know he's gonna grow out of them in like, 20 minutes, but I couldn't resist.
This Thanksgiving kicks last Thanksgiving's ass!
Oh that's sweet. Don't touch me.
Oh, um, around 8:02. We ah, talked for a little while, and then um, we went out for an innocent burger.
Yeah, you should.
Yes! Why, did you-you forget to make yours?
Oh yeah. Definitely.
I can't answer that! Chandler's my husband.
Oh yeah, I remember mine! Ohh, it was my sixth birthday, my dad took me to the park, I got it, and...it bent.
Oh my God, Richard.
Oh good.
Oh come on, it's only fair, you paid for the flight. Now is, is that enough lire?
And I don't know if you've noticed but she's a HOTTY!! HI!
Blow drying what, you have no hair.
Wendy? -- That sounds like a girl's name.
Hey! Continuing the countdown of your favorite meals. Tonight, No. 3, macaroni and cheese with cut up hot dogs.
Hey! How'd it go?
She sent the chicken back again?!
Chandler's making his sex face.
Uh-huh, but I'm sure you can handle this. I mean, I have won awards for my organizational skills, but, uh, I'm sure you'll do fine.
Okay, now we just need something borrowed!
It's so good, that I feel really selfish about being the only one who's eating it, that I think we should have everyone taste how good it is. Especially Ross.
I'm sorry?
Please! I made this game what it is.
Manhattan.
Anyway, Ross and I were always captains, and um, it got kind've competitive and one year, Geller Bowl VI, I accidentally broke Ross's nose.
No! I was just getting into position and then everything went dark.
Check your numbers! Make me rich!
I wanna wear this everyday.
Bye.
We were playing a game.
Ah, yeah!
Well, I guess we've established who's staying here with Monica...
Come on guys! Suck it up! We're closing in on ten hours! It's gut-check time!
I'm sorry.
I think it's romantic.
Well yeah, but, you know, uh, 27 is a dangerous eye age.
Hi.
So what's Phoebe like?
Ohh, here you are. Y'know, I'm-I'm glad you decided to hear me out.
Your favorite!
Oh, you got the whole night, huh?
Yes! Yes! And I think that the first gift that Rachel opens should be from the grandmother of the baby, because you're the most important person in this room. And in the world!
Ohhhh.
You changed?
I never stop thinking about it.
This is so bizarre. I guess it kinda makes sense though, y'know she had such a terrible childhood.
Hi!
I think so. Se, he-he's not inviting you to his party because he likes you.
Rachel, get the book! The book!
Joey... we always know what you mean.
You say 'Thank you very much,' and then you buy me something pretty. Come on, we're gonna put are hands in this bowl, and we're gonna start squishing the tomatoes.
Oh, yeah.
I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! Hi, Tim.
Uh, no!!
What?!
Hello...? Oh hi... Oh my God...! Really...? I can't wait to tell Chandler... Ok, goodbye.
He loves you.
All right, what's goin' on?
Was he wearing a stunning blue suit?
Well, the good news is, I don't think anyone's looking at us.
All right people, we're in trouble here. We've only got 12 hours and 36 minutes left. Move, move, move!
What? Are you serious?! Joey smells gas!
Hey.
Oh, great! Just what you want for a new house with infants. Bird feces.
So, how about you huh? How do you know the happy couple?
Know when to stop.
Stop!
No.
All right, I'm gonna show you something a lot of guys don't know. Rach, give me that pad, please? All right. Now...
Windows are clean, candels are lit. Uh, belt's to tight, gotta change the belt. Did I turn the fish? No, cause I made lasagne. Am I out of control?
Yeah-yeah, you remember how I call you bunny?
