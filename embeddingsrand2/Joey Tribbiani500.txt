And Rachel. I would've told you but they made me promise not to tell!
I told ya.
All right, that's it. Y'know I was still gonna let you have her. But now, forget about it. Prepare to feel very bad about yourself.
Ooh... I can't believe I'm kissing you. I'm kissing Rachel!
No hey Rach, it's cool okay? Y'know I'm a loner too! Right?
Yeah, they do! Quit being a baby and leave me alone! There, you've just had your first class!
Absolutely! And if it doesn't, can I get the extra ticket?
Yeah, y'know at first I thought we could talk about this y'know, work it out, but uh, seeing you two together I don't think I...
Oh! I forgot you used to live here!
Well, that was only 'cause I used the red one to unclog the drain.
Yeah, I want my tickets too ! And I'm buying the Knicks! And Steffi Graff, ah ah!
This sucks man! The last night you're here and I lose the two most important things in my life, the foosball table and $500.
Dah!!
Me?! Oh come on, man! You can't do this! Come on! I'm your hand twin!!
Sorry. Monica and Chandler are making love.
My scones.
For just you?
Now you're thinking you gotta sleep with him.
Son of a bitch!
Oh, come on! I wanna hear it! It wouldn't be Thanksgiving without Chandler bumming us out!
Yeah, you don't want that.
Right. Right. The wedding, gotcha. But I mean, it's gonna start a little late right? I mean, weddings start late. Right?
Maybe she never got your message.
Matter of fact, I do.
Yesterday at my audition, I really had to pee, and apparently, having to pee makes me a really good actor. I got a call-back, so I'm drinking everything. Oh, by the way, that egg nog in our fridge was great!
I wish. See, I guess another thing I probably should've told you about Ginger is that she kinda has a ah, artificial leg.
R-R-Richard said he wants to marry you?! And-and Chandler's tellin' ya how much he hates marriage?!
Now dad, you'll be in my room, Ronni uh, you can stay in Chandler's room.
What's he doin' in my section?
Cage closed?
Oh wow Wayne, it's not really something you can teach y'know? It's pretty much something you're born with if you--You-you can teach it! I'll show you right how to do it.
pel.
Hey, no way, that rooster's family!
Good call. Yeah. But, the face Ross, the face isn't Rachel.
Okay well, I was down on one knee with the ring in my hand.
Oh! Sure! How much? Two thousand dollars?
Yeah! Yeah, why? What's up?
The fridge broke. I have to eat everything. Cold cuts, ice cream, limes-Hey, what was in that brown jar?
I don't know. She's got to be taking it hard, I was like her only client. Except for this guy who eats paper. And I'm guessing he eats more money than he makes. Look, I know she's not a great agent, but she did stick with me for ten years. I'm gonna call her and hire her again.
Yeah!
Audition? I thought you were gonna offer me the part.
Well what's fun about that? You expect me to be the host of a boring game that's just people standing around answering questions?
I got a gig!
Oh my God!
And, and just so you know, if you wanted to expand this scene like, like have the cab crash or somethin', I could attend to the victims 'cause I have a background in medical acting.
Okay! We'll need a six-pack of Zima.
Whoa! And the... huh-huh?
Yeah, well, I still got a week left to go in the program, and according to the rules, if I want to get the money I'm not allowed to conduct any... ersonal experiments, if you know what I mean.
All right, give it back to me. 5 of hearts.
Marcel, I'm hungry.
Hey!
I want the drugs Ross, I want the drugs!
No, in Ross's building! She's back! She's back! Okay, wait there, I'll be over in a second. Got it!
Here's how I know you didn't watch the tape, ok? If you had seen what was on this tape, believe me, you would have some comments. Alright, now remember, I got paid a lot of money for this and it only aired in Japan.
I-I-I-I did?
No, things are fine with Kathy. I'm having a late dinner with her tonight, right after my early dinner with Casey.
Hey.
What, what is it?
No that's not what I was going to say at all. No, what I was going to say is when you're 90 you'll still have the memory of what it was like to be with a 20-year-old.
Shoot! Shoot! Shoot! Shoot, or just fall down. That's good too.
Have a nice six more months Ross!
This body?
Can you stop yellin'? You're makin' me nervous, and I can't go when I'm nervous.
You'd better act surprised.
Really?
Hey! I made that for her!
how come?
Yeah-yeah, I'm one of the cops that won't work with you 'cause you a lose cannon. Anyway, look, I'm really sorry, but I stink!
I can't believe Ross went out with Rachel's sister! When Chandler made out with my sister I was mad at him for 10 years.
Yeah! Good night!
I'm saying that... . This isn't working for me anymore, ok? Estelle, you're fired. Goodbye. .
Well, it's good thing you got out when you did, before she blew up like that Vesuvius.
Thanks.
Thanks man.
Yeah, and when you do, he'll be lucky to have you.
Wow, hey, we'd better get going. If we don't leave right now, we'll be late for dinner.
So? Bring the dog back, you're a hero.
Hey, Pheebs! Check-check this out.
Wow! That was good. That was... Tweezers?
You shut up! I love arguing with her. I'll be right back.
Yeah, but it's my wax.
I'm so confused!
Uh, does it hurt?
Yeah, he likes porn.
What? Chandler! Tell 'em!
Hey, is that when you wrote salt water taffy man?
You're welcome buddy.
Yeah according to the news, most of the city did.
Hey dude, it's me.
Oh yeah, I added three.
Hey!
... she's being unreasonable!
It's not a cat!
Chandler, control your woman!
Look, Rachel, we don't have to do this.
I can't believe you didn't know it was a line!
Hey!
Look, c'mon, please? It's not like I'm asking for some crazy favour. This is what I do for a living. I am a professional actor! Oh, man, I'm two hours late for work! . Look, here's a copy of my reels. It's got all the commercials that I've been in.
Great! All right. I'll see you later.
Hey, dude, let me in. I got a girl out here!
No! No, I quit a long time ago. Did I forget to you that one? I'm sorry.
Thanks so much, Pheebs! We are going to have so much fun, yes we are! Oh! Not that kind of fun.
Hey-ooh Pheebs, are they in there?
Well, I guess he says that because they were on a break when it happened, that she should of forgiven him by now.
Hey, this is ridiculous. I'll tell you what. After I get back from my neice's christening, I'll go down to the coffee house with you and we'll all have a nice cup of coffee alright. No problem, Joey's there.
Hey!
Oh, a wiseacre. . No, no, no, I understand you plan to support your wife by playing the piano? Isn't that kind of unstable?
Hey guys! I was at the library all morning and I already finished my five pages for today!
All right Pheebs, stick out your plate!
Whoa-whoa, what is it?
So ah, Phoebe tells us you write jingles.
This man is my God.
Hey, is uhm... is Chandler here?
What the hell!
Uh, listen, I just wanna thank you for this great opportunity.
Yeah!
Hey! Joey Tribbiani! I'm here! I'm here!
No, no, my mouth says the words, my brain is thinking monster trucks!
Oh, you're Phoebe's fan!
Yeah!
Dude, if you think Fireball's relaxing, you've obviously have never played.
Ross!
What?! What's wrong with my eyes.
Dude! What are yo-you trying to kill me?!
Done! I did it! Heh, who's stupid now?
I know, yeah. I feel like we're all growing up. Person named Wiener, God that kills me.
Well, I... I know exactly what I'm gonna do!
She was kidding about that right?
Yeah, it seemed pretty important.
Ooh! A tape with a girls name on it. It's probably a sex tape... Wait a minute... This says Monica... And this is Richard's apartment...
What's up with Gene?
C'mon, Ross!
Wow! How do you know how to do that?!
No!
Yeah, and there won't be a relationship left to rebuild.
You know what you should've done, you should have told yourself that little story.
That's like a woman wanting to be a...
These'll go great in my new place. You know, 'till I get real ones.
What?!?! Oh dear God!
Yeah, there's just one thing that might be kind've a problem. See, I, uh, had to kiss this guy.
Hey-hey, who's your friend? Hey!!
Hey! Let me ask you guys something. I have a new headshot taken tomorrow right and the photographer said she thinks Ishould have my eyebrows waxed. Is that weird for a guy?
Maybe she wants you to learn something. Huh? Now is there anything you're really bad at y'know, sexually?
She has a lot of crap!
Fungus! Yeah. Place is full of it.
Wow! Didn't know that.
I don't know. What are you wearing?
Yeah, I didn't know you guys were going to be here.
Enough said, I'm there for you man. Where is she, upstairs?
No way. I've been going to the guy for 12 years.
Great. Then you'll be able to spend more quality time with your real friends, the spoons.
Fine! Take their advice. No one ever listens to me. When the package is this pretty, no one cares what's inside.
You're kiddin'.
Hey!
Wooooooooow It's like they're on fire!
How are ya? How are ya? Where are your babysitters, huh? Why's the bedroom door closed?
Get out.
Oh yeah, yeah, she's great, but... I kinda got the feeling that she was sort of... coming on to me. And I definitely would get the part if I would've... you know... if I would have sent the Little General in.
NO!!!
Yeah, yeah. I've got tons of stuff I could do. I'm gonna hit the beach, go swimming...
All right, all right.
How little are they? I mean, are they like scary little?
Great!
Oh-ho, and mine!
Good night!
No, I'm on right after this guy shoots himself.
Yeah, whatever.
Relax okay, I-I-I can get this open. Anybody have a coat hanger?
Wha-a how about this: Another table leaves, right? But there's still some food left on their place, okay, what's the restaurant's policy about people eatin' that?
Yeah, you fogged Danny.
Hey, that'd work on me! Why did I get to buy Mrs. Butterwords?
Okay. Yeah. Listen would you uh, would you like to have dinner with me tonight?
Yes, all right? All of her hot dancer friends are gonna be there and they're gonna be, be drinkin' and dancin, and we really wanna go!
Do uh, do you got any beer? All-all I got is this melon stuff that Rachel left. I don't...
We have to find the rest of the platoon!
How come you have two?
Yeah...
Me! I'm up for puppets!
Look, Rach, Rach! I've been with my share of women. In fact, I've been with like a lot of people's share of women. The point is, I've never felt about anyone the way Ross felt about you.
Yeah, Erica went into labor last night. Monica and Chandler are at the hospital right now!
Hey Ross. This probably isn't the best time to bring it up, but you have to throw a party for Monica.
Look, I'll come to the party but I'm not dressing up.
Are we talking about one of those big boats that carry cars that go like five miles an hour?
Wow! Sure! That's great!
Ahhhhhh, I didn't get the job.
Thank you!
Let me see if I approve any of these clowns. This guy wears a rug . This guy's Canadian . And this guy is in a cult, ok, and it costs you 5,000$ to get to level three and I don't feel any different. Joey: Pass, pass, oh, pass, double-pass, pass...
Oh yeah, sorry about that. Mob mentality or whatever, I don't know...
Oh right, right.
Je de coup Clow.
And that's Wednesday. Ohh.
Hey!
Okay. And uh, are you married.
Well, I guess we'll never know whose it is!
So you're gonna have to do it in the mess!
Aww, man, he took the five of spades!! Oh, no-no-no, here it is!
Ross-Ross-Ross-Ross! Stay away from that guy , and that guy . And that one-Dude! They're all huge!
It isn't working.
Not so much.
Really?! Uhh, what color is it?
Jan-ice. 'Cause I, just, I feel bad for Ross, you know, we-we always go together, we're like the three hocke-teers.
Uh, Pheebs, you had a barrel for a dollhouse?
Okay, bye.
Yeah, okay.
Hey, there's a dog out there!
I'm sorry! This never happened to me before! I'm an expert at taking off bras! I can do it with one hand! I can do it with my eyes closed! One time I just looked at one, and it popped open! I blame your bra!
No we weren't!
Look, don't you think that will be a little weird?
Three tickets to today's Rangers game!!
Now? You want me to go over there now?
How could you lose him?
gesundheit.
No, an entertainment unit, with a mail cubby built right in. It's a one day job, max.
Twice?
Hey!
Oh? Oh! Okay! Okay! Let's hear their plan! Now, what's the future look like for Dina and Bobby?
You don't wanna see what I just saw!
Yeah-eah! 200 dollar reward, split five ways!!
This is your place?
Oh man! Aren't you guys done yet?! I wanna sit in my chair!
You?! And-and you?!
Rachel, would you stop saying that?! Hey-hey look, remember on the show when-when Caprice was dying and she gave me...
All right, all right, all right, all right, you wanna know what I do when I take resume shots?
No you can't do that, where would the chick and the duck live?
I said name one!
Nothing...
Ok.
Right. Ok, ok, uh, ducks is heads, because ducks have heads.
I can't believe you said woowoo. I don't even say woowoo.
Oh hey but, before you guys do that I need to talk to you, and Ross, I need to talk to you.
I put it on to scare Chandler!
You look like a freak.
Are you kiddin'? Phoebe lived on the street. Okay? Plus, she's got this crazy temper. She-She's not standing right behind me is she?
What was it?
What? You never said anything about an audition!
Ok. Well, how, how can we make it easier?
No. Rosita does not move.
Hey, I got one keyhole and about a zillion keys. You do the math.
All right. Let's get the contestants out of their isolation booths. And they're off!
And you never knew she was a lesbian...
Oh, I've been there. Yeah, I am gonna go drive my Porsche.
A little salami.
Maybe she meant to get you a hooker.
What did you say to him?
No he doesn't!
I'm gonna do it.
What?!
Oh come on! Just pick one! Between Monica, Phoebe, Chandler, and Ross if you had to, if you had to, who would you punch?
Really? She... she loves me?
I think so.
Hi, Rach.
It's called Shutter Speed, it's really cool! Yeah, umm, I meet this girl in the subway and we fall in love in like a day, right? And then, she disappears... But I find out where she lives and when I get there this like old lady answers the door and I say, "Where's Betsy?" Right? And she says, "Betsy's been dead for 10 years."
Uh, really good. Really good. Yeah, I should be ready to kill myself any day now. Wow, you sure found that quick. I just-I wish I didn't feel this way about Rachel anymore, y'know? I wish things could go back to normal. I mean, I love living with her and God, helping out with the baby is just amazing, but now I think...I think Ross feels left out. Y'know? When I had to take Rachel to the hospital, the doctor thought I was the father. God... You should've seen the look on Ross's face. By the way, I have no idea what I'm doing here. For all I know I'm just locking it more. Oh hey, did you try opening it with a credit card?
That's great. Thanks Rach.
Actually uh, could you give us a second?
Well, let me ask you something, was Kip a better roommate than me?
Oh man!
I don't know how to play Cups.
Yes! Shame about you man.
Y'know, breadstick fangs are always funny.
All right!
No, hit me.
The Irish gig guy?!
That's not a bad idea. Yeah. Okay, but if I got to turn on the charm tomorrow I'm not wasting anymore of it over here with you guys. Well, actually I got a little bit saved for you Pheebs.
And you'll be nice?
Right, I go-, I got it.
No! But y'know, I'm an actor, I'll act cool.
It's okay, it's okay Rach, it's me. Put down the scrunchy.
Why?
Hey, does somebody wanna hand me one of those tiles.
Hey! It's your bachelor party.
Who?
Yeah!
So uh, hey, that uh, that wedding ring, huh? Man, that's nice!
Say that to him and you're golden.
Did you see the size of the closets?!
Look, it was a job all right?
YES!!
Rach we had to get out of there because, look what I won!
Oh, I do. How you doin?
What? Whoo... What?
Oh! Ohh! Oh!!
Okay, Monica picks ten, I call nine! Anyone else?
Is everything okay?
No, no. He said "When are you gonna grow up and start being a mom?"
Listen, I know the invitation says 6:00, but does that mean that you want people to get there at six, or the show is gonna start right at six?
Well, unfortunately, I don't get many callbacks so...
Well, there were a couple of calls last night, but ah, I don't think any of them are gonna work out.
Oh.
Whoa, that doesn't necessarily mean that he's breaking up with you.
Oh, I like that, yeah. Wasn't at the parade because I had a family emergency.
Hi sweetie!
Huh. What if I was sweeping a chimney?
that would've been better, I'll try that Hi I'm Joey.
Okay.
Judge rules, no violation.
Yeah.
Hey there you are!
Feel better now?
I don't care, Rach! Look, I am tired of being the guy who knows all the secrets but can't tell anyone!
Yeah, well...
Hey you guys.
Hey! You guys! You're not gonna believe this! I just got off the phone with my agent...
Yeah. Okay, what else? Rent!
Are you really not going?
She's probably exhausted from all that adorable screaming she did last night.
I'm sorry, do I know you?
Come on! You like this woman, right?
Hey no, seriously, I don't need you to pick me... Alright! It still works.
Oh, Chandler.
No. No. No. She lives on the third floor, eighth apartment from the left.
Oh I-I uh, found the keys and now I'm just polishing her up.
It-it doesn't?
Pretty much, yeah.
Uhh, Ms. Phalange, may I ask you a question as an impartial person at-at this table?
Ooh! Ah! Okay!
So I can do it?
Who's that dirty old lady?
Okay, is there anything else?
You know what the. . .
What are you guys doing up?
Cause she uh, she steals stuff.
Hey.
Thank you all for coming. We're here today to pay respects to a wonderful agent and a beautiful woman... ..inside. As Estelle's only two clients we would like to say a few words. Dude, where's my speech? That is entertaining. Al Zebooker everybody.
Hey!
Yeah you do!
I don't know, you see somethin', you hear a word, I thought that's what it was. Let me see it again.
No seriously... I'm really wedged in here.
Hey, stripper!
What? No, no, no! No, no... no... no, no... No, too much is changing, okay? First, Phoebe getting married Congratulations! ... and then these two move into a stupid house in the stupid suburbs...
Hey, how you doin'?
Hey Phoebe.
All right, don't waste it, I mean its still food.
Oh, I'm gettin' heat from the guy in the hot pink thong.
Who did?
Yeah.
All right, car magazines, cereal boxes, but it's like enough!
Yes!
Hey!
Monica and Rachel made out.
I do not.
Yeah-yeah. And the craziest thing is that I just ate a whole pizza by myself!
Hey, hey, look! It's not about a few fries... it's about what the fries represent.
Oh my God! Is that why you guys had to get married?!
So, so how did it happen?
There's gravy?
What?!
Yeah! I made it of this fruit bowl I found in the garbage.
Oh, she's putting Emma down, she'll be over in a second.
Am I psyched? The lead in my own TV series? I've dreamed about this for years! Why have I not been preparing?!
What?
Hey.
All right, here's a list of things for you to do today. Man, this going to be so great! Thank you so much! All right, I got to go to work I'm delivering twins today, but only one of them is mine!
Ah, it's beautiful.
"Oh, Chandler, now, now, that's it. There, faster!"
What is it?
I still haven't gotten a check for your half yet.
Oh yeah, I always picture your Mom when I'm having sex.
Where's all the tissues?!
Hi.
No-no! No way! Joey Tribbiani does not take charity...anymore.
Hey Pheebs!
Do we have to know about that?
Look, what am I gonna do? I'm not flirting but still, I'm drawing her to me like - like a moth to a flame! What the hell's going on over here?!?!? Monica's gonna kill you! Look I need your help, I have to do something to-to repel this woman! Wait a minute, wait a minute, you guys repel women all the time.
We love you, man.
Fire trucks!
All right! All right! Enough! Enough! Enough!! Enough! You two go home! I-I-I gotta talk to Janine!
Yeah! Yeah. I'll be all right.
Dude! I am trying to sleep!
Pheebs, you can't do that. The casting director doesn't talk to friends, she only talks to agents.
Sure, I know lots of girls.
No, but I'm gonna!
Ohh!!
Wise choice, how many rungs?
Oh, come on! Last night I was finishing off a pizza and she said "Uoh oh oh, a moment on the lips, forever on the hips!" I don't need that kind of talk in my house!
Oh that's terrible. I'm-I'm really sorry.
No, no. See, you and Drake are having a fight.
No way are you cool enough to pull of Clint.
Morning. Here you go.
No-no, stay right there. Gettin' closer.
Did you call the cops?
Hey, don't get religious on me, ok. A guy in your position needs to be a little better at relaxing. You know. Why do you think we have the comfortable chairs? Huh...come here...sit down. Ready? Ahh!! Ohh, yeah!! Huh?!
What?
U-U-Um, I think there's been an oversight.
Whoa! What are you doing here? How did your date go?
No. No way, I'm not signing that.
Haven't you ever read the same book over and over again?
So you uh, nervous about getting married?
Thank you. Thank you.
I am those things, yeah.
Well, suppose until the baby's born I laid off it. No extra animals would die, you-you'd just be eating my animals.
Oh, hey, Chandler, we, ah, we stopped by the coffee shop and ran into Ross.
Yeah! No?
wow, the parade is really good this year. Man those horses can crap.
I have to go to the bathroom too, but I don't want him complimenting my thing.
What, you think I'm gonna tell a girl I like that I'm also seeing a cup?
Hold on. Hold on. Rachel coming. Do...Something.
Yeah... Now I have something...
No.
We can't do that.
Sure, May...tember.
And now for the great news.
Yeah, Rach, I think you're handling that really well.
But, ehm... you watched the tape?
Hey guys, so I just called the Powerball hotline, can you believe it? Nobody won.
Ohh.
No way! It's mine!!
I now pronounce you... husband and wife.
That's because all people are selfish.
Yeah?
Does that mean we have to bust it open?
I know. I know. And she's not only my friend; she's my pregnant friend! She's my pregnant friend who's Ross' ex!
Well, you gotta give him something that he can't say no too. Like uh, Knicks tickets! Invite the guy to a Knicks game, you're guaranteed he'll say yes!
Look, I got to apologize on the behalf of Carl.
Listen, I ah, went to that restaurant that you were talking about last week...
Yeah, you can fire her, but I would call security, she won't go easy.
Whoa, hey, maybe I'll go down there with ya and see if I can get an audition to play the dad. I mean who better to play Ben's father than his godfather.
But I made cards!!
Will you relax?! What are you taking this so seriously for? It doesn't matter.
Hey Rach listen, did you know that during pregnancy your fingers swell up to twice their size and never go back.
Now, over to Chandler.
Okay.
No, it's not. I mean you-you made me your best man and I totally let you down!
Nice shoes, huh?
Oh-oh! I'm stuck!
I'm not sure.
Dude, you just described seven days worth of stuff. You've got to spread it out a little, you know. Haven't you ever been unemployed?
This thing welded shut?!
Do you want me to learn?!
Yeah, I don't think that's what it is.
Here you go!
Thanks. But maybe later.
CURIOUS GEORGE ! You know, the monkey, and the guy with the yellow hat!
You've got to pick a pocket or two. Boyyyyssss, you've got to pick a pocket or two..........
Yeah.
Why don't you go see Frankie? My family's been goin' to him forever. He did my first suit when I was 15. No wait, 16. No, 'scuse me, 15. All right, when was 1990?
Hit me.
Maybe he, uhh... drives his car on the other side of the road, if ya know what I mean.
What? Ace is high! Jack, queen, king, ace!
Yeah.
Is that why you wanted to tie my tie?
Hey Rach?
Ooh!
What?
How do you think I got him in the first place?
Alright, who do you want as your emergency contact?
All right.
Why? Is it because I'm friends with Phoebe?
No way! 'Kay look, if I have to go to the doctor for anything it's gonna be for this thing sticking out of my stomach!
My God.
See look, women, carrying the bag. But it is odd how a women's purse looks good on me, a man.
Bijan for men? Bijan for men? Bijan for men? Hey Annabelle.
Y'know what? I think that's enough for now. Yeah. I don't want to be over rehearsed.
Oh, that's cool. We have interns at 'Days Of Our Lives'.
Hey! I am secure with my masculinity.
Well, she graduated from high school!
Is something wrong?
No ... the leather sticks to my ass. You know, this isn't fair. What makes you think that I'm just gonna sleep with her and then blow her off? Huh? Can't you guys open your minds to the possibility that I actally like her, and might want something real? Look, the truth is, I haven't felt this way about anyone since Rachel, ok? I didn't think I could ever love again.
Well then, do it better!
Hey I liked her, alright. Maybe, maybe too much. I don't know I guess I just got scared.
Hey!
Hey, Pheebs!
Oh!
Yeah. You know? You just... Look, you gotta... You gotta think about last night the way she does, okay? Maybe, maybe sleeping together was the perfect way to say goodbye?
Man, if anyone asked me to give up any of you, I couldn't do it.
Oh, women can. You can't.
No it's not weird, it's a miracle!
Hey! Any good mail?
The Empty Vase. Translucent beauty...
I feel so stupid, you know? Why... why do I keep going after the wrong girls?
I think I left a donut up here.
Oh uh, can I give you a hand?
Well, I'm keeping so many things to myself these days, something was bound to slip out!
Dahhhhh!! No! Noooo!!
All right, all right. "Damnit Braverman, it's right there on the chart!"
That's not, prison lingo, is it?
Aw! Does that mean the Sam Goody's sale is over?!
Sure, yeah. I don't have time to say thank you because I really gotta go.
Weekend at Bernie's.
