Don't go! I'm sorry. I'm so sorry! Look! This guy fell asleep! He fell asleep too! Be mad at him! Or, call an ambulance.
Uh, no Pheebs. What's it look like?
Okay, but impersonating a police officer is a serious thing. You could get arrested.
She was.... But y'know what, just in case, maybe we should come up with a set of ground rules.
Where did you hear it from before?
You've got it.
Look what do I do? I wanna get past this, I don't wanna be afraid of the commitment thing. I wanna go through the tunnel, to the other side!
Listen, I'm, I'm sorry I didn't make it over there today.
Seriously, we're gonna do this?
He can do more than that! He can destroy the universe!
To the left, to the left- aww!
Have you ever been with a woman?
Well, you do want all that stuff, right?
I'll bet his dad doesn't think so.
FREE PORN!!!
No! Look, I don't cry! It's not a big deal! Okay?!
Can't believe you guys bought that, enjoy your slow death .
Uh, The Wheatsheaf.
Hi.
Yeah, I know what you're thinkin'! Yes, yes, your breasts are just as firm and juicy.
Noo.
She's not gonna care if I put her stuff back in the same stupid place.
Apology accepted. Excuse us.
That's good! I liked it, they didn't. Joey, for God's sake, go to work! .
Okay! Okay! Okay! You win! You win!! I can't have sex with ya!
Hey Phoebs, can I have the milk after you?
Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas!
I'm fine.
But you said you were ready too.
What is it?
I don't have your boots.
Hey.
But we don't know the neighbors.
Well, why don't you send her a musical bug, op, no you already did that. All right look, you're going to have to go there yourself now, okay, make a few surprise visits.
Why can't we talk in here? With, with, witnesses.
And that became 'they are humid prepossessing Homo Sapiens with full sized aortic pumps...?
Yes, of course.
Did she see us yet? Did she see us?
When I was growing up I...played the one on the far left.
Yeah. Yeah, I mean what, what would we do?
Well, I can't say "hump" or "screw" in front of the B-A-B-Y.
What?
Check out the ring.
I can't believe you'd want us to raise Emma.
Oh, y'know-y'know what, I was looking at it upside down.
Too?
I asked myself that very question, sir. Uh, this is Monica. This is my boss, Doug. Doug this is Monica.
What's wrong?
And I'm sure we're all very excited that Ross and Emily are getting married at Montgomery Hall. I mean to think, my friend getting married in Monty Hall. Ohh, come on!! Monty Hall!! Lets make a Deal!! Come on, you people!! All right, forget it!! Congratulations, Ross and Emily.
I KNEW IT!!!!
All right. I'll tell you what. When we're 40, if neither one of us are married, what do you say you and I get together and have one?
This is going in your book?
Okay, I guess we can lose to junior high girls some other time.
All right. Now go see Miss Kitty and she'll fix you up with a nice hooker.
Ohh. Mmm.
Well, I am drinking lots of cups of coffee because I'm exhausted! Because Joey started snoring!
Love you.
I'm sorry, I got a little occupied.
Yes dear.
I was kidding.
Monica, you remember me telling you that joke, right?
No, just wanna make sure we're on the same page.
Alright I feel youger already!
Doesn't know, "Hello." But she knows Capricorn One.
So you must be going to somewhere fancy to celebrate?
My specimen is in the room and I just want to thank whoever knocked on the door while I was in there. Really helped speed the process along! Janice! You're not... gone?
I wanted to be with you. I missed you so much.
Y'know, I don't know if you've ever looked up the term goofing around in the dictionary... Well, I have, and the technical definition is, two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just wanna spend more time together. But if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me, then we have to, y'know, get you my original dictionary. I am so bad at this.
Yeah I gotta say thank you, I was really nervous. Y'know I've been told I come on to strong, make to many jokes, and then it was really hard to sidestep that duty thing. Duties. Duties! Poo.
No, no, the actual cartoon character. Of course the balloon. It's all over the news. Right before he reached Macy's, he broke free and was spotted flying over Washington Square Park. I'm goin' to the roof, who's with me?
All right!
No, we only went out once.
I mean, You wouldn't want any part of me to get any bigger would you? Don't answer that.
We have free porn here!!!
Okay, I'm gonna go to the bathroom. Will you watch my phone?
Yeah you can do it.
The guy was hammered, okay? There's no way, you look like Ross's mother.
Out of my league. I could get a Brian. If I wanted to get a Brian, I could get a Brian. Hey, Brian.
Joey, why is your cable out?
By the way, this didn't seem so dorky in the hall.
Oh no no no.. I'll get her. I'm super-compentent and totally responsibile and fourth in line to raise Emma. I'll be right there Emma. Just let me get my trusty diaper bag here. Well.. what do you know? I guess, I'll be the one who dies first.
Look, Monica has been working hard all day, she didn't wanna host this thing in the first place, we shouldn't go!
Look at us, we're a couple of couples!
Cups.
Hello? Hey Charlie, what do you know?
Well, it's, it's yummy. So Mary-Angela do you like it?
Pie eating contest?
Well, no, although I did have an imaginary friend, who... my parents actually preferred.
And I'm cute too.
Hey!
Yeah, in fact my father was a den-mother.
Hello Rachel.
It happened in London.
Yeah, wow.
What? Oh, yeah, I'm gonna be a junior copywriter.
Now, is that never talking about it again?!
Oh man! I am so excited-I may vomit!
Yeah or also when you don't have somebody breathing down your neck ALL THE LIVE LONG DAY!!
I bet he can.
Sure!
Hey, hey, those guys are takin our stuff!
Oh my God!
Bladder Control Problem Stop Wife Beating Hemorrhoids? Winner of 3 Tony Awards...
Okay, but that's, like, the easiest era.
We were playing Gin? Y'know if we were a couple, we could play this game naked.
Okay, I'll try. And you can't make any noise.
Ok, that's me.
No-no-no-no! That was the joke!
I am so much older than these other interns. I can't compete with them.
Glass, sand, whatever.
It's, all good! Okay bye-bye Mon! She's-she's gonna kill me.
I'm sorry, are you just used to saying that?
Are you kidding? If I wasn't married she'd be rejecting me right now.
Can I use your phone?
Of course the packaging does appeal to grown-ups and kids alike.
Monica! Wait!
It was fine, y'know? But she didn't agree with me as strongly as she agreed with Joey. She was more like, "I see you point, I'm all right with it."
Sure, why don't you set it up. I'll just be over here, browsing through the personals.
Yeah, and at the end of the play, he, he got up y'know, and he just started like, banging his hands together!
Sweet mother of all that is good and pure.
I suppose that Monica will have the ... manipulative shrew.
Are they end to end, or tall like pancakes?
Hey, by any chance did either of pick uh Rachel for your secret Santa, 'cause I wanna trade for her.
You still can't stand her can you?
Hey! So are you enjoying the bike?
Let me tell you about this chick I scored with last night! Oh no wait a minute that was you!
Okay, well, it's definite, two more weeks of winter.
She has a real name.
Hey.
She's shhing me! It's my phone and she's shhing me!
Say your son never feels connected to you, as one. Say all of his relationships are affected by this.
What?
Let me see this guy. W-H-Wow! Don't show this to Monica! And don't tell her about the W-H-Wow!
Oh, good! Good! Do you guys know how to get a chick out of a VCR?!
I had too okay?! We're getting married! Married couples can't keep secrets from one another!
Well, my apartment isn't there anymore, because I drank it.
Art lover!
Oh, you do? Because she said you guys havent talked in like years.
Yeah. Do we have any Fruit Roll-Ups?
Here!
Okay! This is it! We're gonna get married!
Yeah, I do.
But I do know that it's some time tomorrow.
I know, let's rest and drink lots of fluids.
Yeah, that'd be much worse than being 28, and still working here.
Oh yeah! With who?
Pull my finger--My hand is messed up.
I am sorry I am late. You'll understand when you'll see Joey.
Joey!
But if we win, we get your apartment.
Batman has the Batmobile!
How's your room Rach?
You got a man who's a nanny...? You got a manny...?
You didn't just break up.
You'll have to pardon my roommate, he wanted to marry this.
Oh Mon-Mon-Mon-Mon-look, this is the honeymoon suite. The room expects sex. The room would be disappointed if it didn't get sex. All of the other honeymoon suites would think it was a loser.
You know, I don't mind a... male nanny, but I do draw the line at a male wetnurse.
Ah, the "I'm sorry I rejected you" phone call. I'm not used to getting it from guys. Hey, Steve.
You do realise that's your brother?
Damn it.
What?
Uh-huh, and I got all the top ten scores, I erased Phoebe off the board! High five!
Don't take this personally okay? It's just that I just can't have sex with a sick person.
Actually he's the smallest person in the world.
Hey, y'know what? Why don't we think about changes we can make in the living room?
Yeah!
Nah, Phoebs, that's the guy that comes in the frame.
Hey, you said that without gagging!
Well, I've got a girl in here.
She guessed 8, 9, based on his drawings.
We really...didn't get a chance to...
We're just hanging out by the spoons. Ladle?
So, this isn't over?
Oh, that's not true. You had an impact on me, I mean, it's 15 years later and we're still best friends. Doesn't that count for something?
I'd like to propose a toast. Little toast here, ding ding. I know this isn't the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting. Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know? So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.
Maybe the problem was you were pronouncing it kara-tay.
Wow, it's, it's like porno for clowns.
Why would you say that?
Haha, no thanks!
I said, "Like what?"
Sydney Portier? Hehheh.
Okay, so Rachel's got 48 and Phoebe has the lead in...vegetables, Joey?
And no one touches the air around the TV!
You're on!
Yeah?
...so then the farmer says, "That's not a cow and you're not milking it."
Totally worth it!
So you know this leaves us with...
Hey.
Don't judge me, I'm only human!
Oh, he works in the Fine Foods division.
Yeah, we have all this paperwork that needs to be filed by the end of the year. If I don't get it done, I'll be fired.
Good, God's speed, good people! You're not gonna go?
Oh yes you can. You just make the faces and the noises.
Umm?
OK, what is it about me? Do I not look fun enough? Is there something. . . repellant. . . about me?
You were not supposed to hear that! I said that behind you back!
oh, honey..
Are you okay? I'm so sorry, he wouldn't leave. He kept asking me about chicken.
Yeah, it's a very large plane.
I can see it now, "Look dad, it's the Sphinx!"
Hey! Oh, good, Ross! You're parents like me, right?
All right everybody! Just be quiet! Be quiet! Be quiet!! Pipe-pipe-pipe down! What is the matter with you people?! This woman was trying to do a nice thing for you. She was making candy so she could try to get to know all of you, and I'll bet that not one of you can tell me her name! Am I right?
I say, Drew! Are you seeing anybody right now? Og-ee-op, I'm not asking for me, I'm... I mean... No, I'm-I'm not gay, I'm not asking you out. I'm not-I'm not-I'm not gay!
I-never borrowed your Walkman.
Would you please get some rest!
Oh really? Uh, Monica said she had a date at 9:00.
A-huh. So he's rolling down the street and he starts to lose control, you know... maybe he falls... maybe hurts himself. Just then, a kid comes flying by wearing the shoes. He jumps over the old guy and laughs, and the line reads: "Not suitable for adults!"
And, we're done with the yogurt.
I know it. You know, I'm totally gonna ask her out.
Joey, this is Die Hard 1 again.
Blue blazer back. He-he wants it back.
Okay!
Now that I untangled you, how 'bout you doing a little something for me?
Did I teach her that? Did I just... impart wisdom?
I know.
Nice save.
Actually, uh, we're both the father.
Ross, that was 16 years ago!
You have done enough!
Or we can do the actual telephone thing.
What!? They are totally ripping us off!
Well, you're welcome. And tell them we're really glad they're coming.
I didn't know you read tea leaves.
Ross had a ring?! And he was gonna propose?
Oh, I would never bet this apartment. It's too nice.
What?! Why did you do that?
So she was just pretending to have a good time last night? She was lying to our faces?!
I like her.
Yeah, well, don't expect that to happen anytime soon!
Hey!
You want me to wash my hands first, don't you?
Oh, okay Ross. Listen, this pen is kinda getting boring, so can you pick me up some porn?
What's wrong? What's wrong? You're married that's what's wrong.
Oh, okay.
What if they're not? What if it's adopted by a king?
What Richard thing?
Listen, I've got a secret for ya. I let him win.
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I found this great place called "Invisible things for Kathy." Can you give me a hand with all this stuff?
I used to have that bumper sticker.
Here in Chelsea.
Hi, I'm Chandler. Your live-in boy
I do! Want a hint? huh? "I do" "I do".
Hey, so can you make it on Friday?
She's right, it's Jill. Jill Goodacre. Oh my God. I am trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre! Is it a vestibule? Maybe it's an atrium. Oh, yeah, that is the part to focus on, you idiot!
Oh, believe me, to survive this party, you're gonna have to come up with one too.
I didn't mean now...
Woah, woah, that's not pretty!
You can be the best man when I get married.
Okay, you guys spend waaaay too much time together.
Ok.
You mean this.
Hey, Rach, can I get...
I swallowed the sonic blaster gun.
Oh my God, what's up?!
So where are we on the whole going back to the place where they have all the marriages thing? I love you.
No I didn't!
Look around, you guys. This was your first home. And it was a happy place, filled with love and laughter. But more important, because of rent control, it was a friggin' steal!
What's up with the simian?
What?!
Allright, fine, but don't blame me if it doesn't work. Because you know as well as I do that once Joey sets his mind on something, more often than not, he's going to have sex with it.
How can she be great if she's from Poughkeepsie? That joke would've killed in Albany.
Can I just say one thing?
Ooh, I'm alive with pleasure now.
See, it pays to know the man who wears my shoes. Me.
You know, Ross, some scientists are now saying that, that monkeys and babies are actually different.
I will tell the story! It was going great. I let him win. We were bonding. He even said I could call him dad.
If you get this one, we buy everybody here a steak dinner!
You left a shoe here?!
Hey! Hey Adrienne.
Hello? It's Nancy, they responded to our offer.
Yeah, I guess I could use that. I could say that your love sends me to the moon.
I mean, don't you think if things were gonna happen with Rachel, they would've happened already?
Well?
Yeah, it kinda makes that-that one night special. Y'know, technically we still are over international waters.
When'd you meet her?
It's a great idea.
You do know, I can just turn them the other way around, right?
You have every reason to be upset. We did lie. But only because we've been waiting and trying to have a baby for so long. Now we don't know how long it's gonna be before we can get another chance again.
I think so.
There's no-one around. Why don't we just take this one?
Everything's gonna be all right. Okay, Dick?
No.
No, that was Dana Caplin.
Okay. I've been thinking about it too, and I, I think we're ready.
That's so funny, because I think I just did!
Seven times!
You're Jewish.
Nooo.
Yeah, now how's that going though? Are you okay with the not-flirting thing?
Oh no-no-no!
Did you know this about him?
Alright, here's ten.
Yeah, I'll sit down.
Oh, I don't know man. I haven't talked to her in like ten years.
Okay! So, what do you girls have planned for tonight?
Y'know I was thinking if we had a...a big fight and uh we broke up for a few hours...
Did she go out with him?
I'm coming already!!
I'm only going to pretend I'm moving to Yemen, it's the only way I can get rid off her.
That's the stuff!
Ok, who wants light cheese, and who wants dark cheese?
Okay.
Wow! So tonight may be the night! You're nervous?
I got caught up and work, but I'm quitting tomorrow.
You need new clothes.
BEND OVER?!!!
Becasue it reminded you of the way our forefathers used to bitch at each other?
Hey, guys! Come on! You gotta see what Emma just did.
Umm, how's it going with you guys?
Hey.
So whaddya got there Monica?
I didn't know Monica had these!
OK.
Thank you Gunther, put it there. Definitely not easier with coins. Thank you.
I don't know, I don' I don' know! I was just trying to get into a young mindset, you know, and it just started to flow.
I don't know, but Donald Trump wants his blue blazer black.
But I am willing to offer her all those things. This was just a plan, y'know? A way to throw her off course so that when I offered her all these things, she'd be surprised!
Should I use my invisibility to fight crime or for evil?
Oh My God! You can do a duet of Ebony and Ivory all by yourself!
Okay, okay, but don't worry, because we also have cereals, muffins, waffles, and, jams, jellies, and marmalades. Which I'm fairly certain are the same thing.
Did somebody sign your bra?
Ok.
Sure, everybody loves a kidder.
Yep!
Is that why you became a chef? So that people would like you?
Oh, aaaah!
Okay, good-bye. Good-bye.
Yes.
Right. Right. Well ah, y'know we could flip for it.
Oh, that's Ross's.
That was you?! I thought it was Jack!
They do me?
Oh no-no-no. This is amazing.
Yes, we don't get married unless there's a sign! Okay, so say uh, say you roll another eight then there's a definite sign that we should get married.
Oh my God! That's why I got up too!
If I help, we can find 'em faster!
I can't believe I let you talk me into buying this stupid gumball machine looking ring!
Yeah. No. No...
Well now you understand how I feel every single day, ok? The world is my lesbian wedding.
Oh no..don't thank me. Thank you. You know there's not one thing I would change about you? Not one single thing! And definitely not... two... single things.
No, we're just four people with neck problems. You talk like this.
Well, we're really not that close. Okay, so I guess this is uh, good-bye then.
Well, you...don't look good Joe.
Mine was a humdinger.
Yeah, but I'm, I'm so much faster...
He's Greek Orthodox.
As crazy as soccer?
That's right.
I'm full, and yet I know if I stop eating this, I'll regret it.
I got that!
So how come Richard's selling the place? Went bankrupt? Medical malpractice? Choked on his own moustache?
You look beautiful.
Hey, don't worry. I figure it'll be 2 hours to Phoebe's dad's house, they'll meet, they'll chat, they'll swap life stories, we'll still have plenty of time.
Let me try it on!
Monica, we are not ready to have two babies!
Yeah, me either.
Oh my God, introduce us!
Picturing that tree?
Come on, Ross? Remember back in college, when he fell in love with Carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?
You don't think I've tried? You think I like having 50 dollars taken out of my bank account every month? No, they make you go all the way down there! Then they use all of these phrases and peppiness to try and confuse you! Then they bring out Maria.
They couldn't be worse. I spent eight hours calling him last night, just trying to get him to talk to me.
What?
No, I have a great idea for a present for her.
Here, here!
So, a professor, uh?
Okay, ten bucks says that we can name every item in that bag.
Something else I might have said?
M-Me-me-me!
Would you get that please? People have been calling to congratulate me all day.
Oh, yeah, he's my... he's my best friend.
Again, what?!
That was amazing!
C'mon, there's nothin' to see, it's just a tiny bump, it's totally useless.
You have to give 'em something, you know. Okay, now that was Gerston, Santos, and who's the guy with the moustache?
Y'know, I-I could see how this could happen, y'know you're up there every night, you're naked, touching, kissing.
Yeah, I'm not gonna pay for those acting classes anymore.
Oh, hey, when she gets here, is it ok if I introduce you two as "my wife" and "the woman who's carrying my child"? No? Divorce?
No. Not anymore.
You think I should?
You be cool.
Oh hey Rachel, sweetheart? You have got to tell the post office that you have moved. Okay? We are still getting all your bills and stuff.
I hate this thing!
Okay.
Okay we have to do something about your breath.
Man, if you tried something like that on my birthday, you'd be starin' at the business end of a hissy fit.
Hey! Phoebe! We can talk to Phoebe!!
Oh my God, honey we are so meant to be together. We both have copies of the Annie soundtrack.
It's perfect. It's everything we've been looking for.
Uh, could you leave me one?
It's my joke.
No.
Yeah. I feel so bad. Is there anything I can do to make it up to you?
Come on, it was like cousins having sex up there!
I-I can't believe Jill's gone. I can't help it, I opened a gate.
So you understand, I'd feel a lot more comfortable if you didn't tell people what happened. Y'know, I'm a little...I'm a little embarrassed about it.
I'm pretty sure I put her on my bed.
And I was a perfect gentleman and I walked her to her hotel room and said goodnight.
Hey, I hear what your saying, okay? And, thanks for the warning.
What are you doing?
What?
Hey.
Yeah, we're gonna have to get you out of those shoes.
Oh yea, your right. It's the second one.
All right, I suppose I can wait a day. Hey, what are you doing Friday?
I love you so much.
You know what... these aren't half-bad! You should suggest something like these to Ralph Lauren.
I'm not great at the advice, can I interest you in a sarcastic comment? Some cheese?
First of the month.
No, I know, but it's just so hard, you know? I mean, you're sitting there with her, she has no idea what's happening, and then you finally get up the courage to do it, and there's the horrible awkward moment when you've handed her the note.
What?!
Cookie?
Wait! You look? You-you massaged me.
Okay, what do you guys think?
Yeah! Totally! Totally, and you?
Well maybe you should put some ice on it.
She was working on Valentine's Day so we're celebrating it tonight.
Yeah, you're right about that.
What!?
Which is why you should do it.
Volleyball.
How do you figure that?
Oh, no no no, she took off with my clothes.
I do too.
Somebody is gonna pick us.
That's funny, this conversation's how I got the bullet hole in my head.
Let them win one.
Okay.
Hey.
Hi.
Hey!
You're right, I have no excuses! I was totally over the line.
Awesome, the name really stands out.
Okay, all right. I just spent the entire afternoon looking for a present for Kathy that would be better than the rabbit.
To the bathroom!
There you go! There you are!
Are we greeting each other this way now? 'Cause I like that.
So, we'll tell the truth and who knows, maybe she'll like us for us.
Well good, good for you. You really think that Roger is the perfect guy?
Please tell me you know which one is our baby.
So uhh, how's the palace?
What are you doin'?
Yeah, I mean, it would be rude to them for us to leave now.
Oh, what can happen? I mean, would you...
No not okay, you can't look for Monica's presents!
Yes! You mean the world the world to me. Oh...
I'm sorry too.
oh yes, God yes!!
And the Knicks rule all.
So y'know, uh, when's he getting back?
This is not going to work.
Come on, you're going to Bloomingdale's with Julie? That's like cheating on Rachel in her house of worship.
Oh no thats okay, you're totally right. I don't know anything about disciplining a child. But it did hurt my feelings and I want you to know that when I die, you don't get Joey. Ross walks away with a face of yeah ok. Amy walks over to the couch and sits down next to Rachel: Ucch. Uchh In case you hadn't noticed, I'm not talking to you.
See? Intuitive!
We're notwe're not saying anything.
Well, close to...
Well, I see you've had a very productive day. Don't you think the cowboy hat is a little much?
But you said you forgave me. It was just a couple of cigarettes-no big deal.
Awesome.
I don't know, but don't worry, don't worry, because I know how to take a picture now. Okay, see? Look down , look down, look down...
But the Kit-Kats are all right?!
Sorry, you had a paleontologist on your face. But, uh, it's gone now, you're alright.
Weekly Estimated Net Usage Systems. A processing term.
It's like 'Night of the Living Dead Christmas Trees.'
If she asks, I protested a little, but ok!
Oh yeah.
So, are you really gonna go out with that nurse man?
By then, the cheesecake may have gone bad. We don't want her to come back to bad cheesecake.
What's going on?
This is about you and Richard. He's clearly not over you. He keeps a tape so he can... look at it whenever he wants.
Uh Joe, when it's one o'clock in the morning and you don't come by? That's okay!
Yeah, Joey said I uh, I needed to relax so he gave me an antihistamine.
Ummmmmmmm, no.
How is that ever going to happen?!
Marcel?
So, let's go.
Oh! It's on! It's on!
Sure, and Joey; do not let Ross look at any of the maps or the globe in your apartment.
OK Phoebs, how many do you want?
G'night.
You know that's not the reason Joe.
Do you think he'll ever forgive me?
All right, I'll tell ya what, the next time you ask me a question like that I'll lie.
Because it's flattering! Come on Monica! Come on Monica!
Hey, come on, it's not your fault.
Don't go.
New haircut? Necklace? Dress? Boots? Boots!
You're naked in this picture!
