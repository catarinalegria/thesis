All right, half the people. I mean, just try it and see.
Phoebe.
I can't believe you let them win!
See? They're as different as night and... later that night.
Is-is-is that message old or new? Old or new?! Old or new?!
Yo, Bing. Racquetball in 15 minutes.
I can't do that either! The soles' are already a little scuffed up and the insides are filled with my blood.
You thought about that?
I think our lover's spat will start a little early this month.
Come here. Okay, be right back.
So maybe they could umm, call the award the Monica?
What do you think you're doing?
Hey Frannie, welcome back! How was Florida?
Hey! There you are!
What do you mean?
Hello.
Hey Joey!
What?!
That's true.
Alright, well, maybe I should let you and the second prettiest girl in Oklahoma get back to work.
I think it's romantic.
Oh, wait, is he the guy I met at Christmas?
Wendy? -- That sounds like a girl's name.
Okay, I umm, I ran into Richard yesterday and he asked me if I wanted to go for a bite and I did. The only reason I didn't tell you is because I knew you'd get mad and I didn't want to spoil our anniversary.
Okay, look, I-I have enough stuff for one more sandwich, I mean I was going to eat it myself, but
No no no, if I couldn't pay you back right away then I'd feel guilty and tense every time I saw you.
What about the part where he has rabies?
Why don't you just weigh out the good stuff about the relationship against the bad stuff. I mean that's what I did when I first weighing stuff.
Shut up!! It just got interesting!
It's just, I think, there's never gonna be a right time to have a baby. I mean, now you're unemployed and in a little while you'll find a new job that'll keep you really busy. There's always gonna be a reason not to do this, but I think once the baby comes, forget about all those reasons.
Look at it! Ohhh! Wallpaper's a little faded, that's okay. Carpet's a little loose. Hardwood floors!!
Hello, Joey.
Oh, I so can't believe this! My uterus is an inhospitable environment? I was trying so hard to be a good hostess!
Thank you.
Yeah, that'd be great! Thank you!
Yeah.
I know! Hey, you haven't been practising the routine, have you?
Wasn't there a little song?
Oh no! You and Phoebe are gonna help me in here.
Oh that's so sweet.
Chandler!
Wow! It took you all night to come up with that plan?!
You dropped it off?
Huh?
Oh! So you think I'm a failure!
Ross and I always wanted to be Donny and Marie.
What?
Well, you don't have to decide right now, but if you could just look at our file...
Oh!
I mean they're trying to do everything they can to make me quit, and if there were any other job, I would. But this is something I've been waiting for my whole life.
Joey, that paper's like a year old!
..I dunno, a little too Alan?
Alright, here we go. We've got salmon roulettes and assorted crudites.
Nothing, I don't know.
Hey.
How desperate am I?
Oh no!
Yes! We found you a really cute and funny guy from Chandler's work!
Yeah.
Keep talkin'.
Including me?
What am I gonna do?! That is the dress! That is the dress! Wh...Chandler wants the band. What do I do?
She's not pregnant. It's Rachel. Rachel's the one who's pregnant.
Yes... What is the end of that sentence?
Oh...Rach!
You can spill. In the sink.
I know. .
It's almost our anniversary!
De-caff. Okay, everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor. This is everybody, this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my brother Ross?
What?!
You know how much I love listening to your music, you know, but...
It is so great to meet a guy who is smart and funny, and has an emotional age beyond, like eight.
Hey. Okay, so umm, since that video camera thing didn't work out uh, I thought that I would give you just a little preview.
And Joey.
Yeah? I'm proud of me too.
I know!
Okay, can we change the topic? Because it's really doing nothing for me.
You're a pig. And you can't do this.
Yeah, like I don't know, maybe you have a work problem that you need his advice on.
How about Mockolate mousse?
That's all right.
Phoebe, don't get upset!
Run, Phoebe, run!
Okay, so Ross will be doing the reading.
Oh, no thanks.
My boots in tan! Hey! Can you get a little closer so I can see the price?
Okay, sperm donor number 03815, come on down! Okay, he's 6'2", 170 pounds, and he describes himself as a male Geena Davis.
And you're cute too.
Honey, having a heart attack is nature's way of telling you to slow it down.
What?
Hey! Don't be a baby!
I made you a surprise.
Oh...
Let me try.
Anyway um, when he left he forgot to take the poem with him. Now, I am like totally dense about poetry, but I think it's pretty good all right. Check it out.
Oh, it is sooo perfect. Thank you so much.
So we do Supergirl.
Really?! You promise?
Then I won't have to kill you.
Oh, come on.
Well, he told me he was going out with the guys, I just didn't know that you were the guys.
You had sex in his chair?!... I said that a little too loudly, didn't I?
Thanks!
That's sweet. Drink your hair.
I-I-I think you look great.
Oh that's okay. Don't worry about it, you can give it to me when we get back.
You are so cute! No. No, it was a fight. You deal with it and move on! It's nothing to freak out about.
You do?!
Why do you guys have so many keys in there anyway?
Alright, well I'm tearing the lettuce.
Hi, um, I'm gonna need a new set of these forms .
And then he told me he would run away with me, and he didn't.
Wouldn't you love to do it just once?!
Mhmm.
Sooo?
Well, that was weird. You were loud, and I was fast.
Do I go horseback riding in the park? Do I take classes at the New School?
Just a little but...it's just so scary! I don't even know what I would sing...
Ok, thanks for coming, I hope you guys had fun.
And everybody has to wear costumes. Come on! It'll be fun!
Hello?
Well, if you had kept listening, you-you would have heard me call him Mr. Big......ot.
Well, I thought that I would cut up the tomatos.
How about at a game, on the big screen?
Just...please tell him.
Phoebe, you're gonna be with your grandma?
I can't leave it! You gouged a hole in my dingy floor.
007 has a fancy car!
Aww! I love you!
Why did they get divorced?
Nestle Tollhouse?!
Oh, I'm sorry. Can I get you something?
Oh my God! Well push it in! Push it in!
Why?!
Yeah, apparently, they're pretty good seats.
Rach, you're in a great place in your life. Come on, you've got a great job! Good friends...
Oh, I wish there was a job where I could wear this all the time. Maybe someday, there will be.
Okay! It's time for dinner. Everyone we're using our fancy china.. um and its very expensive so please be careful.
I can't believe her, y'know it's just-it's so typical.
Chandler, I'm gonna die a virgin!
Bunny!
This switch thing has been driving me crazy. So I turned it off and checked every outlet. Now, four of them don't work. Which means, one of them has to be controlled by the switch. So, I plugged in things in all four of the outlets that-that make noise, so that way, when I turn it on I just follow the noise and find out which one it is.
Okay.. Well, I'm going out with a guy my friends all really like.
Great!
No it's not! You want it, you're gonna have to win it!
Chandler, look I-I know that your dad embarrassed you. I know...
What?
Come on! Chandler!
She's in the bathroom.
Chandler! He's your father; he should be at the wedding.
Hmm, bite me.
Hang on a second I just got in.
The Way You Look Tonight is on here! Dance with me?
That's right, she came back all by herself.
Hey, you touch that and you will be sorry.
I told you not to go down there!
Your favorite!
Oh..
All right, let's be practical, if Ross isn't willing to do it, he's not the only guy in the world you can have sex with. You can borrow Chandler-Chandler is good!
It's that terrible?
I can't believe this!
Oh good God! If you want a baby so bad just go steal it!
I just wanted to say that I hope you do have sex tonight and I hope that you guys get back together, but I must warn you, the night that you announce your engagement I'm going to announce that I'm pregnant!
Carol called me to thank me for the lasagna, I asked, she told me.
No, sorry.
What?
"Hi I'm Rachel, is my sweater too tight? No? Oh, I'd better wash it and shrink it!"
Okay, if it means that much to you...
Noo!! It's driving me crazy. I mean every other way he's like the perfect guy, he has everything. Plus! He actually has everything.
I love you.
I can't believe Joey's having lunch with his stalker. What i-, what is she like.
It was Laura... She gave us a great report and we are officially on the waiting list.
Okay, where is the Kat Stevens CD?
With a wok? I thought you were going to read my boring book to put you asleep.
That's Phoebe! Where did you get that?
Just come.
Y'know what? It really creeps me out choosing other people's sex clothes.
All right, check me out.
I am scrappy.
You've got to get back out there, it's your party.
What are you doing?
Well at least, I'm going to mute it.
Oh man, they think they are so slick messing with us! But see they don't know that we know that they know! So...
So Rach! You're the first guest at Hotel Monica! Umm, you'll just have to tell me how you like your eggs in the morning. And I thought I would bring them to you, y'know, in bed. Oh, you have been through so much.
That's not even a word!
Good night!
I did.
Ok everybody, it's time for flan.
Hey, we can take her back with you if you want.
Oh!
Oh.
Noooo!!!!
Come on!
Hey.
Ok. Oh boy. You are doin' so good. You wanna squeeze my hand? All right, Ross, don't squeeze it so hard. Honey, really, don't squeeze it so hard! Oh, Ross! Let go of my hand!
Well, we had a little fight.
If you're not going then I don't want to go either.
Y'know, I love doing crossword puzzles with you honey!
Like only if the queen comes?
Okay, now we just need something borrowed!
See he's nice. Right?
Keep talking.
Where's Benny? There he is! Where's Benny, there he is.
Hey, have you guys eaten, because uh, Richard and I just finished and we've got leftovers... Chicken and potatoes... What am I wearing?...Actually, nothing but rubber gloves.
Why does my cinamon stick have an eraser?
Well, you-you coulda just turned the cushion over.
That's okay.
Look!
Y'know, it is so strange seeing Ross here this time of day, 'cause usually he's got the children's hospital.
...in this day and age how dumb do you have to be to get pregnant?
Ahhh, hey honey? Don't you have to be at your interview now?
Oh no-no-no, stay, stay, stay, just keep talking. I'm always the hostess.
And that's great for you guys, but we want a lawn and a swingset...
What did they do to you?
It's Danny.
"Take me to the mansion in the sky-y". I am sorry, the song is over. Did you see me out there?
Ok worse case scenario is...we borrow some money from my parents.
Great! Umm, well what-what I was doing in Chandler's room is that umm, I was cleaning it! In fact, he pays me to clean it!
Hey, at least I knew where my guy was.
Oh my God. You're even dumber than I am!
I'd like a scotch on the rocks with a twist.
Hate that guy!
Hey sweetie!
You're gonna what?
What's the matter?
I don't care.
I wanna wear this everyday.
Okay, Ben, I won't tell your daddy that you had ice cream for dinner, if you don't tell about our little bonking incident.
Strip Happy Days Game?
Yeah, I've just been fiddling around in here making delicious treats for everyone.
No, no, no, no, no, no pressure, no pressure!
Oh no, I already packed. The only thing I couldn't find though was your Speedo.
No, I just talked to them.
Yeah?
In the bank.
Ohh, fun!
Ooh, what'cha gonna do, fat boy, huh? What?
Yeah, I changed them. I-I sent you a fax about it!
I-I-I wanna thank you all for coming. My family and my friends...
I'm sorry, why is this girl going to call me?
Oh good.
Ross, your little creatures got the remote again.
All right then, your bra would still be big.
YE-AH!
You're from Yonkers! Your last name is Buffo-Martisis!
How many perfectly fine women are you gonna reject over the most superficial insignificant things?
A hat! Yes! We need a hat.
Great, now he's waving back.
Oh, thanks! We'll try to stop by.
I would love too, but I can't! I mean I just can't, you know that I'm not good at confrontation.
So is it horrible? Is everybody working really hard?
Oh dear God!
And Mindy, your maid of...?
So I'm not supposed to share my doubts and fears with the guy I'm gonna spend the rest of my life with?
And then Chandler was, was really sweet and he consoled me. And well we drank too much...
Wow. That is not a happy hi.
Shh!! Wait, what?
Yeah-Oh that's right. You, you always wanted me too. Hey, I see you got your mustache back.
You know what? Then, Joey, we want you to do it.
How are we gonna get home? Maybe a piggy-back ride?
I'm sure they'll be here soon.
What are you doing?
A-ha!!!
Great! We're hangin' in the kitchen! Let's stay in the kitchen!
All right. Tell me if this is too cute. Lesbian wedding, chicken breasts.
Put it out!!
Actually, I'm gonna go check on the twins.
Hey.
I'm gonna go into the bathroom so I can look at it in the mirror, as I eat it.
Yeah baby!
Umm, if ah, it might be okay if Ross came skiing?
Have you lost your mind? Chandler, this isn't about me! This is about you and all your weird relationship commitment crap!
Alright, let's see..
We're sorry honey.
Ah-ah-ah, now you started this, you will finish it.
Oh it's so cute. I wonder what age it is when you stop being able to put both legs over your head.
Okay, Phoebe, y'know what? That-that's it, that's it, all right? No dinosaurs, no ghosts, no giant dogs, okay? They're not the right size, they're not Victorian, and they just don't go.
You seriously changed your name to that?
Uh, I don't know, butter, eggs, flour, lime, kiwi--
I arranged some pillows on the bed to look like a guy.
I knew it!! Y'know, you're not so quiet yourself, missy!
How could you mess this up? It's so easy? You go into the booth, you count to five and you turn around!!
Phoebe, Ross sucks!
Inside of telling us you decided to write in your stupid book!
Yes you are! That's the only way to explain all this stuff!
So far so good!
One hour? You are such a leaf blower.
Yes. Yes, I was. A guy. From work. I'm seeing a guy from work! Ha!
Come here, I want to show you something!
It's okay! It's good! It's good. It's a disease!
-but that wouldn't be fair to me, it wouldn't be fair to Alan- It wouldn't be fair to you!
I'm not gonna go out with him.
That's Paul's watch. You just put it back where you found it. Oh boy. Alright. Goodnight, everybody.
Damn it!
Hold on a second, just put a little club soda on it and it should umm, be.....
I'm fine.
Hey!
That's just good sense!
Just waiting for it to stop bubbling.
Oh my God, it was the best funeral ever! I mean, everyone loved the food, and guess what? I even got another funeral for tomorrow-the dead-guy-from-today's best friend. I mean, it is like I am the official caterer for that accident!
But Phoebe, you can go out with a creepy guy any night of the year. I know I do.
Oh, yay. Ok about that two.
Rachel, it's a world where Joey is a neuro-surgeon.
I'll pick it up for you!
What do you mean?
Hey how was dinner?!
No.
So basically, this is a getting-rid-of-everything-Rachel-ever-used sale.
Whose little ball of paper is this?!
Really?
That's a good call. Right.
Ooh! I'm sorry! I think, I THINK, that may have missed the table!
The big hat, the pearls, the little pick handbag.
Aww...
Well, didn't you?
Haha!
I can't find garbage bags!
All right, we'll call you when we get back.
Oh! They're late and they're sloppy!
Look umm, of all people, you do not want me to tell this story!
Okay, he's a senior in college.
How about if I dance around all covered in sauce? Huh? You think it's funny now?
I have some pretty exciting news!
I don't think mine likes me either.
Yeah, because I hear the king is looking to adopt.
But I insist!
All right, so what do you say?
No! No you should! A lot of major actors do nude scenes! I mean the chance to star in a movie? Come on!
No one.
Hey! How'd the audition go?!
Alright, I'll tell you what. I'll come get you in 5 minutes with some sort of um, kabob emergency.
Oh, my God.
: maybe I will go yea will have a second honeymoon at the Tulsa romana.
Are you trying to tell me that we're moving to Oklahoma, or that you're gay? All right, not that this matters, but did they at least offer you a huge raise?
I...I have to fire him.
Hey! So what do you think?
Okay, I think I get how to do this.
It's gonna be so hot!
Honey, I just don't think that you understood the joke.
It's just that he doesn't have that much free time, ya know, and I don't know, what do I do?
They're my pants!
Not any more.
Hey guys check it out! My mom sent me the paper!
Umm...
Bye.
Phoebe, they didn't make you pay for those knives, did they?
No! We only mess around at his place!
Honey. Uh, not to sound too Florence Henderson but, dinner's on the table.
'I am Bea.'
This is your current cellphone?
Well if Ted Kopel talked about his coworkers botched boob jobs, I would.
So you stole that tape from Richard's apartment?
Oh, sure it does! In high school, you weren't jealous at all even though all your girlfriends were cheating on you!
Okay, I will. Remember that thing that we just discussed that you wanted to do?
Okay, I'm gonna go check on something across the hall. You start by washing these Not with soap!!
Oh! Me too!
Well?
You really think this is okay?
How does she do that?
Why did you do that?
No, don't say it! Don't even think it!
Too strong for me?
Hey!
You just wanna stay home so you can make a move on Joey!
Okay! The movers will be here in 11 hours. Rachel has not packed. Now, everybody has to help! Chandler, we're gonna start with...
Ross, she's 25 years old.
I'll be right there!
'Cause I was going by it the other day and I saw that there was a stock with my initials, MEG, on it and, well, sometimes I have to watch for two or three hours before it comes up again but when it does, it's pretty exciting.
No. I think we learned that from the sugarlips incident. I'm gonna get some tea.
Wow!
Excuse me?
Well, do you think he was waiting 'til after you left, so he could cry?
Did you go home and change?
Well umm, Chandler and I are moving in together.
Because I need the money, and I thought that it'd be a great way to get rid of that last little schmidgen of self-respect.
That's true! I knew I married you for a reason!
Okay, look, this is probably for the best, y'know? Independence. Taking control of your life. The whole, 'hat' thing.
That was a good day!
You came?!
No. It disappears back there behind that baseboard. For a minute there, I thought it went downstairs.
Oh my god, then...
Well, her father pays you for baby-sitting right?
All right, big brother. Which of these do you think would make your little sister look hotter, so your best friend would want to do her?
How do you know a mugger?
If you want, I'll do it.
Hey!
At least you took me down with you!
I'm not a baby, you're the baby.
Yes! Carol and Susan's caterer had a mountain bike accident this weekend, and she's in a full body cast.
Okay, I'll see you tomorrow! Just so you know, we're not seeing him tomorrow. I-I cannot spend another evening with that man. Do you remember how he behaved at our wedding?
Hi honey. We just got a wedding gift from Bob and Faye Bing; they don't like us do they?
Maybe.
What?!
Did you ever feel like sometimes you are just so unbelievably uncoordinated?
Phoebe, we're getting married, married; not sixth grade married.
I really wanna have a baby.
I wish I could say the same. I'm a little shook up!
I know! I'll tell you something, we are gonna do that again!
Nice work everybody! So much for the y'know, "You can drive it, but don't tell Rachel" plan!
All right, come on guys, let's go! Tie score, and we're runnin' out of time. Forty-two!! Thirty-eight!! Hike!
Oh, I'm sorry.
Oh that's great!
Hey! Where 'ya headin' in those pants? 1982?
All right, listen up. There is usually only one dress in each size so when they open those doors, fan out. Now, this is what you're looking for! Memorize it! When you locate the dress, blow on these. All right? Three short blasts, when you hear it. Come running.
Thank you.
Okay, guys, listen, don't forget that tomorrow is the day that Emily gets married again, so whatever we do, just try to really keep Ross's mind off of it.
We'll see.
I can't believe it! I lost!
Joey, do you work here?
Um, I straightened out your shower curtain so you won't get mildew. What? To me that's nice.
Now, Mom, everything's going fine, really. Yeah, Ross is great. He's uh, he's in a whole other place. No, he's gone. No no, you don't have to fly back, really. What do you mean this might be your only chance? Would you stop? I'm only 26, I'm not even thinking about babies yet.
Yeah.
Okay, come on, I can't get married until I get something old, something new, something borrowed, and something blue.
You know, Rachel, when you ran out of your wedding, I was there for you. I put a roof over your head, and if that means nothing to you... twenty dollars an hour.
Uh, no. Loosely translated 'We should do this again' means 'You will never see me naked'.
Yeah. I hope she can kick his ass.
Rach, he's a friend of ours.
Nothing. Just something I want to get Phoebe's opinion on for Valentine's Day.
Hi.
Okay.
'Kay, here you go.
I hope by maid you mean mistress, because if some other woman was here cleaning then...
Well, unless goose is a vegetable...ha haaaah!
Ok, it is definitely less than a ballpark.
Ohh... Oh, that's okay I hate when people come back to complement the chef. Like I have nothing better to do! So what's up?
Oh, you can have an accent and I can't?! Top 'O the morning to ya laddies!
Sure! Alright...
You had a bathroom break at 2030. Pee on your own time, Mike! . Now, in regard to the toast, okay, you wanna keep them short, nothing kills a rehearsal dinner like long speeches. Okay. You just get in, do your thing and get out!
And the eye!
Hey, you better hope that we're pregnant, because one way or another, we're giving a baby back to Rachel.
Okay, I'd like to know how much the room was because I'd like to pay my half.
Why is everything different?
Sandra, I am so sorry, I thought you were Rachel and we just weren't ready for you yet.
We're-we're really sorry we fogged you.
Please, just do it!
Ross is really strong! Okay, he's the strongest out of all three of you! Except for Joey.
Yeah, is that okay?
Where you can make out with your assistant.
Oh my God Stu! I-I can't believe you did this! Now are you absolutely sure she's a hooker?
Phoebe, wait a minute!
Yeah! Roses or Lilies?
Are you sure you wanna do this?
No, just a Friday night.
Yeah. That-that was the problem.
Yeah, but Janice? That-that was like the worst breakup in history!
Well, I was going for wrong, but we can use your word.
Y'know what? I am really tired of your bellyaching! Okay, I-I worked really hard at making this a nice place for us to live!
This is so cool, maybe this is something you can do every week.
Hi.
That's okay.
Aaahhhhhhh! Aaahhhh!
Wait, what about the time I hit you in the face with the Silvian's pumpkin?
Come on, that was back in high school! How could that still bother you?
No.
So have you called her yet?
Did you like her? And I'm just asking as a friend, because I am totally fine with this.
I don't know.
Joey that is so sweet.
All right.
You're so efficient. I love you!
Ok, um, I'll go with you.
Oh, honey, can you make sure we get a King size bed!
What is the matter with you?! Do you want to fall into the trap? Do you want to fall into the trap?!
No! Phoebe!
Maurice.
Uh, listen, I need that broiling pan that Joey borrowed the other day.
Wow, really? One time he just looked at my bra and it popped open.
Once!!
That can't be your father.
Oh, that's sounds great.
Oh my God, Mike was gonna propose?
I'm Catwoman, who wants to borrow the dress when you're too big for it.
Okay, I have looked through a bunch of career guides, photocopied and highlighted key passages and put them into alphabetical folders so you can make an informed decision.
Something went wrong with Underdog, and they couldn't get his head to inflate. So anyway, um, his head is like flopping down Broadway, right, and I'm just thinking... how inappropriate this is. Um, I've got something in my eye, uh, Joey, could we check it in the light, please?
Umm, so how long have you been working with your dad? Come on, one of us had to mention him.
What's goin' on?
Which one?
Oh my God!
It's not like, I haven't any opportunities. I mean, y'know, I'm just waiting for the perfect guy. I'm seeing this guy Roger, all right? He's not perfect, but umm, I think maybe I should just get it over with. Y'know, give him my flower.
Hello. Oh, hey Ross!
An era is defined as a significant period of time. Now, it was significant to me, maybe it wasn't significant to you!
Maybe I do! I'm pretty feisty!
We're not doing anything.
You want a problem? I'll give you a problem!
Okay, I-I'm sorry. You and Joey, your both focusing on this uncomfortable thing, what you need to do is to change the subject. Next time you see him try to get him talking about something else.
Happy New Year.
It is so weird, I know what I said, but uh, this morning, I was lying in bed I was, I was imagining what it would be like to say yes. I know it's a little sudden, and it's a little rushed, and it's totally not like me to do something like this, but that doesn't mean I can't. Right? I mean I'm-I'm crazy about Pete, and I know that we want the same things, and when I thought about saying yes, it made me really happy.
Okay.
Yeah, but I'm the only one related by blood.
Hello! Organic substances recently discovered in the depths of the rain forest!
Not Chandler, just Joey.
It's work.
Hey, how long are you in the city?
It will be my pleasure. My guy has diplomatic coupons. Your guy can't even say coupons.
I guess I wanted to keep it as a souvenir.
So, Chandler, who's on your list?
Oh, it was awful. I guess some people just don't appreciate really good food.
No, it's okay, not only did I get to go out with Chip Matthews, I got to dump Chip Matthews.
Well he is! Yeah, I mean marriage is all he talks about! My goodness, in fact, I'm the one that's making him wait!
I'll be coordinator! Oh my God! I'm so sorry, I didn't get you anything! Okay, look everybody has to help! Okay? You can help, can't you Phoebe?
Oh my God, he's gonna do it now. Please, I cannot watch this, let's go.
Ross, is he gonna live with you, like, in your apartment?
Hi. About last night... I know you are under a lot of stress and even though the things you said hurt me a little bit... My point is, uh, well, I'm willing to take my job back.
Really.
Well yeah, but, you know, uh, 27 is a dangerous eye age.
You would not. I can't believe this. I hate this, you're too normal. I can't believe my boyfriend doesn't have a thing. My boyfriend doesn't have a thing.
Yess!!
Ross let me ask you a question. All jokes aside, where is this relationship going?
Really?
Is Amanda here yet?
Rachel's not here.
Who's Gladys? Oh! What a tragic loss!
I know, Amanda! Ah! She called me too! She's the worst!
Listen uh, I-I've been doing some thinking, and I don't know whether it's because we're here or Rachel's giving birth but umm, I think we should try to have a baby.
I am, aren't I?
Game!
That's probably what they'll say.
Rachel, you can go down there, you don't have to smoke. Just say you wanna get some fresh air.
Well, now's a good time. I'm on my way to have my ears cut off.
Oh, that's great!!
Hey.
Ow. Ow. Ow.
What if I have babies, okay? I mean I'm gonna look different. I'm okay with that, but I'm not sure that you are!
What?
Do not start without me. Do not start without me.
What-what was it you were gonna tell us?
Can I ask you just a little question, huh? Why tonight?
Oh good you're all here. Thanksgiving tomorrow, four o'clock. Oh, guess who I invited. Remember that guy Will Colbert from high school?
And who laminated it?
Oh my God! Have you lost your mind?
What happened to Janine?
IT'S THE HUMIDITY!
Oh, okay. No problem.
I am not!
Okay!
You're not a senior?
Let her finish, doctor.
That could be a four or a five. It's your call.
Ross, you've got to do something about the humping.
What are you doing here so early?
What, that little thing at the prom?
Oh good, I hate it when you do that.
Because Armadillos also wandered in the desert?
Is he gonna introduce us?
Dr. Burke? I don't think so. I mean, like, he's a grown up.
I can't believe that this whole time we thought he hated us. I mean, isn't it amazing how much you can touch someone's life, without even knowing it?...Would you look at this dump? He hated us. This is his final revenge!
Hi, Josh.
Okay, so from now on we have to call you Princess Consuela?
Joey, this is sick, it's disgusting, it's, it'snot really true, is it?
Alright, you know, we got it, we got it. Let's play for real. High stakes... big bucks...
Joey, we had a deal. That-that's why you're here! I've got to fire you!
Okay, please be good, please. Just remember how much you all like me.
Okay fine, now Ross...
Please... Chandler is the love of my life... ... oooh leather pants! Have Mercy! Ross: So, eh... it's probably gonna be hard for you to leave Boston, huh?
I think we found a place.
You're a really good kisser.
Are you okay? You've been acting weird all afternoon.
What is the matter with your hand?
What?! Oh.
No, not here. Maybe here.
Why don't you just be straight with her? Tell her the truth.
Hm-hmm!
Okay. Okay, I'm ready. Come on big fella!
You are just the sweetest.
Like I remember his office number! Speed dial 7.
Okay!
I can't believe she's gonna say yes to David. She's clearly in love with Mike.
You mean the guy who kept calling you Ron?
Well maybe I'm ready now. I mean, it's a little scary, but maybe it's right.
Did they just kill off Joey?
Dad, dad this is a good thing for me. Ya know, and you even said yourself, you've never seen Richard happier.
I love you.
Rachel, what're you gonna say to him?
No reason. I-I keep private things in there.
Oh. Big family dinner tonight?
Yes.
Yeah, but her plane got delayed in Athens. But actually, she should be here by now.
Come on guys! Suck it up! We're closing in on ten hours! It's gut-check time!
Hello? Hold on. It's your boss.
Come here. I can breath through my mouth.
You wanted it to be a surprise.
Who has her own little desk when Roland's not there.
Oh my God, Joey, that is such a great tip.
This is Monica! I'm Phoebe's friend. Listen, Phoebe is back with David and he's going to propose to her, and she is going to say "yes" but I know she really wants to be with you!
Sure.
My brother, the PhD would like to know if there's any way to treat this orally.
Are you insane? I mean Joey, is going to kill you, he's actually going to kill you dead.
Well it wasn't my fault, Phoebe was in charge of the invitations!
Why don't you just go out with her!
Hi!
Oh sweetie, you can never embarrass me. Okay, you can easily embarrass me. But come on, it doesn't matter. All right? I married you! So I want to dance on my wedding night with my husband. Come on. Just try not to move your feet at all. There you go.
Hugh! Hugh Grant!
Yeah!
You just put an empty carton back in the fridge!
Ross's apartment is nice! How come we don't hang out here more often?
Fat?!
You're gonna find a place. But even if - God forbid - you didn't.. So you postpone the wedding. Is that really so bad? I mean, think about it. You could take all the time you needed to get everything that you want. You could have tulips, you could have salmon.... Mmmmm... Salmon!!
Okay.
Hey, where have you been?
Good? Didn't you hear them...I was great! Thank you so much for making me do this. That's is the best gift ever.
That's right. You're making a commitment and that's the same, whether you do that at the Plaza or, where are you gonna do it?
Joey, we know that's you.
Okay.
Thank you.
All right fine, your guy may have a great body, but our guy is really funny.
The only problem!
Great!
I know! I mean it's like me and your dad, that's a totally separate thing.
Are you serious? You still see Dr. Gettleman?
Really?!
Tim wait!
You call eight hours alone with my label maker wasted time? Ooh, now I get to use my shredder!
What are you talking about? She obviously lives on the second floor, seventh apartment from the left!
Sure! It doesn't mean anything! Just like I know it doesn't mean anything with you!
But, we pick again! We pick again!
I mean I-I don't I think I have enough quarters.
Oh my God! That's my restaurant, I'm the chef there.
Okay! My turn! My turn!
I can't believe we're here.
Uch, you see, I'm ovulating.
If we wanna get on camera, I think we have to get up on one of those platforms. They've been taping those people up there all day.
OK!
I never stop thinking about it.
I am not wrong.
Now you think I wouldn't enjoy that, because it is so fake, but I still do.
If-if-if we ever did what you did a man would never call.
Yeah, but at least I'm doing it!
Look honey, I wanted you to hook up with Ross as much as you did. But he's with her now and you're just gonna have to get over it.
Y'know what? I-I don't want a big, fancy wedding.
Hey, we would still be living here if hadn't gotten the question wrong!
It was, it was really nice. We started talking and I-I ended up having lunch with him.
Let go! I'm a tiny little woman!!
No, space doody!
Well, you're not working either.
No. He's not a horrible guy.
Yeah, I saw him waiting for an elevator.
No-no-no! We need something old!
Okay, well, why don't we all meet upstairs in an hour?
It sure is nice to do this together, isn't it?
NOOOO!!!!!!!!
Oh no, wait! Joey!
Oh my God! Let me see.
There's more beer, right?
Ah, the other Jack.
That was a terrible throw!!
Don't you just love it?
Oh my God! I love that!
Like?
Really? I'm perfectly comfortable. Hey, hey, hey, get in line buddy, I was next.
Yeah you will! And, are you kiddin' me?!
Ross , foot on the floor or come over no more!
We took a cab. Did you guys walk?
Why?
Oh please, you just want more blue pins.
Why not?
I think, that if you really like this guy, you should just trust him.
Very good! What do you need it for anyway?
Well, if you don't have anything to copy, why are you going down there?
Are you okay?
What's 'pleh'?
Hey.
Wha... How the hell is that gonna help?
Well, this must've brought back some really bad memories for you, Ross.
So this is it, we're really gonna adopt?
Okay, Joey's gonna catch it, and you and I are gonna block.
You're-you're-you're gonna bring the Barca Lounger over here?
That was some hot love you gave me! I'm gonna go get ready.
Shut up, Joey!
Pizza?!
Joey! I'm so proud of you!
Okay, y'know what, I'm not fine, I'm not. I mean how can I be fine, hearing you come in with her, she wants to see your bedroom.... Y'know what, what if we're friends who don't see other people?
I gotcha. Sorry. So, did you ever make him throw up a whole anything?
I know, he's too charming, but if you two start going out, then it's just gonna make it so much harder for me to hate him.
Chandler, this is crazy! What did you even say to him! "Come up, meet my wife! Give us your sperm"!
Phoebe, tell her!
No leg-chewing for us sir.
Because we're moving in a couple of days and it just didn't make sense.
So do them for free.
Do you wanna do it at the same time?
So then you know?
'Cause I don't want to encourage this kind of behaviour.
Oh May 15th.
Rach? What are you doing?
Oh crap!
Hey, I have all the space I need. Just do what I did.
Daddy! I don't think we need to hear about the specific positions you and mom had sex.
The days and nights are hard! I get it! Okay? Look umm, Rachel I'm sorry! I have to start getting ready! I'm getting married today!
So, did you come by to watch us win the big bucks?
I clunked your heads together!
Please! I made this game what it is.
No.
Look, all we're trying to say is, don't let what happened with Carol ruin what you got with Emily.
You said the baby.
Noo!! Okay!!
And they love me!
No, I don't even know how serious he is about me. Until I do, I'm not telling them anything.
Okay. Four.
And you're not gonna do that.
Are you sure?
You see that guy? He's in classics now, but y'know as soon as we leave he's going straight to the porn.
We are not going to whistle.
Okay, great!
Plus, everyone's gonna see your thing.
Hey!
All right, look, nobody's smoking pot around all this food.
Okay, so it doesn't involve Ross or Rachel or Chandler or Joey. But, what about Pete?
Was it...?
All right, Rachel, I know-I know you think I'm crazy, please, before you tell him you love him, just-just try to find one person who thinks this is a good idea. Because I bet you, you can't.
Yes! Exactly.
Oh my God!
So the wedding caterer sent me this list of twelve appetizers and I have to narrow it down to six.
No! Rachel, you didn't find anyone so you can't tell him.
Okay great!
The second that Ross walks in that door, I want you take him back to your bedroom and do whatever it is that you do that makes him go, rweee!!
What did you do to his sweater vests?
Well, you're-you're sweating.
And I'm going to go get drunk.
Well actually, Ross doesn't.
What the hell happened?!
Phoebe, you have a, a twig in your hair.
Phoebe, relax none of that stuff ever happens! They just put it on there for legal reasons!
Here you go sweetie.
That's what it sounded like.
I'm just saying, if we put just a little bit of makeup on you.
Yeah, I do know.
Yes I do!
That's because he wasn't invited because of the way he behaved at our engagement party.
Of course we will, come on we gotta make dinner.
What are you serious? You wanna marry him? Wha... What about Mike?
Okay, I'm not getting this!
That was amazing!
You know everything!! Oh wait, double or nothing. I bet you the baby is over seven pounds. I bet you it has hair. I bet you it's a girl.
Right there! That was so fake!
What? Why?
The fake kind!
Here you go!
I know! What is this, 1985?!
It's so sweet. It really is. It has this big yard that leads down to this stream and then there's these old maple trees...
What?!
'S'going pretty good, y'know? It's nice, and, we're having fun.
Oh, he's sober alright. Just turns out that Fun Bobby was fun for a reason.
When were we not friends?
Your mother told you this?
He took off?
Really!
Thank you.
Nope.
Well, how bout just her mom?
And you're cute too.
You did? How?
Oh my God! No wonder I get such great service at Cafe Maurice.
I'm sorry, they just, they just look so good! And the saleswoman was looking at me like, "Oh, these are way too expensive for you."
They'r alright.
Hey!
Thank you.
Oh, just until the glue dries.
Come on!
You know that? You don't want to spoil your appetite.
That does not mean you know us better, I-I want a rematch.
Why? Because everything is my responsibility? Isn't it enough that I'm making Thanksgiving dinner for everyone? You know, everyone wants a different kind of potatoes, so I'm making different kinds of potatoes. Does anybody care what kind of potatoes I want? Nooooo, no, no! Just as long as Phoebe gets her peas and onions, and Mario gets his tots, and it's my first Thanksgiving, and it's all burned, and, and I... I...
It's not mayonnaise!!
Two in a row! You've got to use your tongues now!
Well yeah.
You didn't!
He cannot play at our wedding! I mean everyone will leave! I mean come on, that is just noise! It's not even a song!
Tomorrow!
What do I smell? I smell smoke. Huh-did you smoke?
Whoa-whoa-whoa, Phoebe you gotta take her! Y'know, I-I-I said some really bad stuff about her, but y'know Rachel has some good qualities that make her a good roommate. She gets tons of catalogs and umm, she'll fold down the pages of the things she thinks that I'd like.
Hi, again.
Ross!!!
Y'know what?! I gotta go! Ugh!
I've still got it!
Look what I got! Look what I got! Look what I got! Can you believe they make these for little people?
Really you can do that?
Oh! It was our pleasure. We are so much enjoying getting to know you.
Chandler, if that dog's been here that long, and you haven't had a reaction, maybe you're not allergic to this dog?
So-so you would've just lied?
He had to go, there's a deer just outside eating fruit from the orchard.
I am loud!
Wasn't it a lot more exciting when we were y'know all over each other all the time?
What for?
Well, sure, what with it being her funeral and all.
I still say that if we had called your dad we coulda gotten better seats.
D'you want to?
Who are they killing off?
Phoebe, I can explain!
Oh God! He's gonna come by and borrow some candles for his big date!
Sorry, Rach.
Phoebe, why is there a dog in our apartment?
Shut up, the camera adds ten pounds.
Oh boy me too!
Well, my breasts are going to get bigger weather you like it or not! And you know what? It's not just my breasts. My ass is going to get bigger too.
Wow! For just a week you guys are really close, huh?
Well, we certainly are alone.
Alright, we're gonna have to unscrew the chain.
I got it! How about, if we win, they have to get rid of the rooster?
Something to remember me by!
Don't come in here!
What are peanut butter fingers?!
Ross, can I?
Wait! Wait! Wait! You can't start today! Today's the rehearsal dinner!
Come on, we can't let them win!
Yeah.
I'm his sister, okay? I love him! I don't want to see him get hurt! Come on! Doesn't that give me the right to control him-help him?
Okay, I have to get that. Now when I get back, I want you and your friends to be gone. Thanksgiving is over. The Vein has spoken.
Well, you're not gonna get going are you?
Hey, look at me. I'm making jam, been at it since 4 o'clock this morning.
My surprise party!
Waaay too special.
Hey!
What are you guys doing here?
Y'know, I-I... I have to figure...some st-Y'know, some stuff before I can...
Of course.
I just thought he was nice, y'know?
Fine! Happy Anniversary!
The good stuff, huh?
Nah... not-not special enough.
I gotta go to work. Has anybody seen my left boob?
All you had to do was buy the card!
Are you crazy?! We own those two! I mean look at 'um, he can't breath and she's popping pills.
Yeah, you can hear everything through these stupid walls.
Well, don't 'cha wanna?
Okay, please be careful with that. It was my grandmother's. Be careful.
Water rules!
Because she's not gonna get to keep the babies.
No, those first two windows, that's the lobby. And y'know the other one over there, that's the stairway. You've been counting wrong.
Ahhh!!
What are you doing with those?!
Well...I'd better get going.
This is all of your things.
Not it!
Oh God!
Well so?
Y'know what? You're right Phoebe. You're right. Thank you!
I know!
Oh! Ohhhhh! Oh! Phoebe, come here. Aw, this is my new bed. You gotta feel this bad boy.
Harder than it sounds. Isn't it?
No time for that!
In case it happens.
NOOOOOOOOO!!!!!
That's Bill Clinton.
Oh, and I can also speak a little French. Voulez-vous coucher avec moi ce soir? Why? What did I say?
Do you hear something?
In like a half-hour?
Sorry. So how's it going with Joey?
Not just the phone pen. I never get my messages.
Well Joey, we're all...we're all very proud of you.
What one? You wanted him to invite you to the party and he did it!
You can't say that!! You-you don't know!! I mean I thought I was gonna pass out from the pain! Anyway I-I tried, but I-I couldn't...bend that way. So...
How do you feel?
Well, umm, Walker was looking for this big bus load of kids.... All right, I get your point.
Okay.
Well, I just think the baby would keep falling off the dog. Do you, uh, do you , do you not see kids in our future.
Phoebe, that stuff is...
Oh, we're not doing that. Okay...
The park huh? A public place.
I love how it crumbles. Now see, your chocolate doesn't do that.
Hello.
What?!
Aw, my little nephew. Come here, little one. There's my little baby Ben. Hey, my little boy. Hey, he's not crying.
He was so good in that movie of MacBeth.
I'm guessing your new girlfriend wouldn't urinate on my coffee table.
Oh, it's so beautiful. Ohh! Y'know, I-I don't know if I feel right about this.
Bye.
I thought that was a good thing.
That's true.
Then all your stuff would be here.
Okay, I'll try.
Thank you. Just make yourself comfortable.
Oh my God! Ross, you wouldn't believe the cute little noises the twins are making. Listen.
That's also like the tenth time you told us.
But I thought if you left, you get fired.
Chandler! What are you doing here?
For this weekend! Oh gosh, it would be perfect, we get to see Joey plus we get to start our anniversary celebration on the plane. We can call it out plane-aversary.
Great...
Oh my God! Chandler!
Okay, how much?
Chandler, where are your tools?
What? Are you serious?! Joey smells gas!
Did he give you that whole "You're-not-up-to-this" thing again?
It's okay. I don't care. It's uh, it's fine.
So, did I hear Poconos?
Phoebe, come on, you have to tell us.
Why, do you write him a lot?
Joey, speed it up!
You're still so funny. You're so funny. What do I do?
No, I haven't.
Okay I'll take her, here.
I won the game.
Chandler look, I don't want to be one of those wives who says, "You can't go to the game. You have to spend time with me." So, if you could just realize it on your own . . .
Ooh, chocolates on the pillows! I love that!
I love you.
Okay, just to be clear comedy with the plates will not be well recieved. Ross makes some sort of sound to let us know it hurt.
Guys, you're a few steps ahead of us.
It's so weird, how did Joey end up kissing Charlie last night? I thought you'd end up kissing Charlie.
Alright, lets say that it is him, would we not want the baby? No! Would we treat him any differently?
Wait a minute, y'know, you're bringing me!
Ohh! Did you do what I said? Did-did-did you tell her?
Give me one more.
There was just one woman, wasn't there?
They won't be ready for weeks.
How did work go?
Oh well, where is he?!
All right. Mmm-mmm.
You're not gonna be here New Year's Eve??
Burning's good.
Nothing. Nothing.
Okay. No need to panic. Deep breathes everyone. Okay umm uh, we're just gonna have to spend some time and put the CDs in the right cases.
Umm, and looking at people differently.
Oh, I was hoping you wouldn't remember.
Well I think the length of teasing is directly related to how insane you were so, a long time.
Um-hmm.
Hi. Uh, we'll be right there, we're just trying to decide something.
Perhaps, you would like me to turn like this, so that you can bunny bump against my back.
What about the second minister we meet with? I kinda liked him.
Y'know they say a watched pot never beeps.
No, honey, its. thats a special plate. See its a game, whoever gets that plate wins.
I'd rather hang out with a sniveling work weasel guy when I can be hanging out with my boyfriend who I actually respect.
Hey! My first review is out!
We'll just...we'll just let her stay.
Do you want some shortbread? Eh that's Scottish like you are.
Thank you so much Phoebe.
So? Do you think we should get it?
Yeah. Mine too.
God, you are so strong.
Ohh!
You think we're being obvious?
Oh, that's Nana, right there in the middle. 'Me and the gang at Java Joe's'.
Great.
Unless... Maybe we do it here. I mean, how much can she even be aware of at this age?
Yeah I am!
I know!
Why not?!
All right then.
Oh good. Good, look I'm so sorry, for screwing up that cutting-her-out plan. But I have a new plan. Chandler agreed to call here in a few minutes with an emergency.
Hell, yeah!
Oh! Let's see, well...if this is the wedding hall then umm you're parents will be at home in Queens.
What are you up too?
Oh, hey! Oh good, you brought food!
That's better. 90 seconds is a long time not to think about it...except all I did was think about it.
Dad! There's Ross , why don't you go talk to him?
Oh y'know what? If you're gonna be acting like this all night, I really, I don't even want to be around you.
Hey! Good luck!
Maybe this wasn't your shot.
Hi, how are you doing Kelly?
For the sixteenth time, no... I do not think you're obsessive.
Rachel's really the one who's pregnant.
Wow, what's the bad news!
Bye.
You think this is clever?
Let's get the show on it!
Four, please. I'm really nervous. Thank you.
Do you want to go to the bathroom, or do you wanna play poker?
Was it...
Okay! Okay! We can take a hint! What are you doing here?!
Oh, what about that guy over there? Remember? That is the guy you flirted with at the counter that time.
All right, biggest suite in the place. Come on!
You didn't find her?
Ahh, Phoebe, I'm gonna miss you!
Oh, honey!I can't. I was just telling these guys that things are crazy at the restaurant!
I don't know sweetie.
Yeah. We-we had sex and then we fell asleep.
Oh God! What did I just step on?
Really?!
Nah, he doesn't do anything for me.
What, forget it!
Oh, honey, the earrings...
That's not possible!
Ross? Let's go.
She's a stripper.
Okay.
Hey Joey, I don't think we can use this.
That's because their nerves are probably deadened from being so stupid. But hey, y'know if you don't believe me, please, by my guest.
What about my questions?
Joey! You didn't even know her!
There's no man in here. How dare you accuse me of that.
Oh my God! Oh my God!
Umm, can we see you ride it?
Fifteen minutes.
So, are you sorry that I told them?
Fifteen minutes.
Alright here's something, it says to try holding the baby close to your body and then swing her rapidly from side to side.
About nineteen pounds.
I was.
Wow.
Would you look at them?
We'll discuss it, in the morning!
Well, y'know it's none of my business, but aren't you married?
For what?
2 minutes, 12 pies and a part of one tin! Okay, I see you guys at 4.
Mom's here? I wanted to have lunch with her today, she told me she was out of town.
You love me!
That is not true!
What?
Yeah.
Oh my god.
Well, I think I shouldn't look directly at them.
Honey, listen... You have nothing to worry about with Geoffrey.
: really?
All right!! All right. I got stung. Stung bad. I couldn't stand. I-I couldn't walk.
