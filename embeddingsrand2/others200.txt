Well, he's doing terrible!
Some day, maybe.
Gavin Mitchelle's office.
So you see Wigglemunch, that's why it's important to shaaaaaaare...
Stop!
Oh, my major was totally useless. I mean, how often do you look in the classifieds and see "Philosopher wanted"?
Ohh, I don't think so. I mean it would be different if it was way into the future &#150;and-and-and we were getting married or something.
Fill this out and bring it back to me.
But, we're thinking, given the right marketing, we can make Thanksgiving the Mockolate holiday.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, listen, I am parked at a meter. Let's do it.
Sophie, would you please climb out of my butt. Why hasn't he called, Rachel? Why?
Well, if you stay till 9:20, I am.
Yeah! Punch him!!
Oh, ok. Alright.
So, how ya doin?
Oh, yeah you loved that glove! You took it every place you went. You never went any place without that glove.
Oh!
Y'know what, I should do it.
Alright!
I just sold it to that gentleman.
I am Father Kalebasous.
So you look like you're doing really well! I guess you're mugging days are behind you?
No.
Oh, blimey, I still can't believe you've got an earring!
Okay. Have you started having contractions?
All right, I was 15, it was my best friend, Ruth, and we got drunk on that hard cider, and then suddenly, I don't know, we were, we were making out.
Hey it's Mona! From the wedding.
Cleveland.
Excuse me. Um, these are from the two gentlemen at the end of the bar.
So it looks like you've got some great experience here. Let's see ahh, reason for leaving last job?
Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut...
Don't take that tone with me. All-all right you can.
Chandler, you were the strongest person in the program. We're offering you the position of junior copywriter.
You can't leave a baby alone!
Yes, at 4:00.
Umm, I'm still here.
Yes?
No.
Did he call?
Bye guys.
I am so sorry. The doctor insisted on closing the curtain for the exam.
Oh, I'm sorry honey, I'm so, so, haaaaa! I'm so, so sorry, I just haaaaaa! But I, oh what happened was, I-I-I can't breathe. Can you get me a bag, or something?
Careful! They haven't quite taken yet.
Hey Phoebe.
Okay, okay... when Barry was engaged to you, he and I...kind of... had a little thing on the side.
Oh my God. He just gave you the coldest look I have ever seen. It's like he hates you. Then it is true.
Someone in there?
Can you believe how we spent our two weeks together?
Oh good.
Joey! Here we go. Let's go very quickly!
Hey, listen. Call me.
Worth a shot, huh?
Um, would you like to come in?
Hi Mike!
I know, we did it!! Hey, that was incredible, huh?!
That's a good one.
Well, I'm back from Minsk... permanently.
I don't want you taking that thing.
No, he's in prison.
Hi, Alan.
Hey don't take it personal, he's under a lot of pressure, ya know, starring in a movie and all.
I think we've seen enough!
With a K.
Sergei, would like to apologise for my behaviour tonight.
Hey, where's the chicken?
Well, I don't know. I mean, it's conceivable that you wanted to sabotage your marriage so that the sibling would feel less of a failure in the eyes of the parents.
Well it's wonderful to have you up and about, again, dear.
Oh hey! Here they are!
Okay, thank you. It's the Italian Hand-Licker, isn't it.
No! That's bluffing. Lesson number one. Let me tell you something... everything you hear at a poker game is pure crap. : Nice earrings.
Listen, it was nice to see you. I gotta run backstage.
Oh, sure. Now. But what happens when he meets somebody else and gets married?
Is this the same spoon that was in my cast?
And what will that be on the side of?
Morning's here! The morning's here!
No-no it's not! I don't want to lose you! It's-it's like I was saying to Ursula when I was making love to her and I thought she was you-Yeah it is too weird.
What happened son?
Don't you point your pants at me! We have no choice! Anywhere that's half-decent would've be booked months ago, Ross don't you understand? This is our wedding I'm talking about.
Well, I wouldn't call her a star, but she's really good. You should check out Inspecther Gadget.
Or if you prefer, this table is available.
Yes, it has a head!
It's a... It's good to meet you! Thank you so much for taking the time out to show me around.
No, of course we're not.
Oh yeah! Hey, save the cork and then we can fill the bottle with water and put it back so they don't charge you.
Oh please. Every moment is precious. Y'know? Besides, somebody had to ride in that other taxi with the rest of your luggage, and your friends don't really seem to care too much that you're leaving.
Mr. Tribbiani.
Touchet, touchet, Miss Americccan pie. Ameri-ccan.
Tartlets. Tartlets. Tartlets. The word has lost all meaning.
All right.
Yeah! I'm just going down there to relax and hang out with my friends.
Well, what was supposed to happen?
Hey, I forgot my scarf.
Which one are you?
Yeah. Me. Oh hey, that's me. Hey uh, I take it you're just visiting someone.
Oh yeah? Well then how come I can't get my VCR to stop blinking 12:00?
Yeah, you can melt art. Hey, can I use your phone?
I don't think the next patient is very far along.
Okay.
Yeah, I'm her date.
Ok, you want the dirt? Alby was seriously insecure. I mean, he was really intimidated by the guy I dated before him.
Uh, uh, uh, I am here.
I think you may have a drinking problem.
Phoebe? The lady who sells toner?
All ticketed passengers for Flight 1066 to Athens should now be on board.
Uhh, I don't know, I just bring the scripts.
Three.
I didn't even have a chance to act as though I'm okay with it!
Not really.
I'm telling you, you never gave them to me.
Why did you have to fill your father's head with all that garbage about making things right? Things were fine the way they were! There's chicken in there, put it away. For God's sake, Joey, really.
Im gonna wait till after we order. Its her, right.
But you're not anymore!
Well, we were in the city shopping, and your mom said you work here, aaand it's true!
That's right Wesley! I just stopped by to say that, you're not a real doctor! And that woman's brain, is fine!
You know.. this.. this is classic Rachel.
I like it.
Smelly Cat, Smelly Cat, what are they feeding you? Smelly Cat, Smelly Cat, it's not your fault.
Cut! Alex, remember you're supposed to cry. Can you cry for us this time?
Oh, yeah!
Ok, listen, thanks for coming in.
I'm sorry, who are you?
It's just not really who I am. Y'know, I've always been happier when...Why am I telling you this? You don't care about this stuff.
I'm just saying, I have a cabin in the Adirondacks if you ever want to get away from the city, well, that'd be just nifty!
Well if it helps, it worked very well.
I promise.
I wanna see everything! Times Square, Coney Island, Rockefeller Center...
Oh, your baby's so cute. Why did you put a pink bow on a boy?
Dr. Biely, your proposal includes some field work. Where might that take place?
We don't need any toner.
Hi.
Okay.
Oh I'm sorry, Jack's father is not available.
I was her accountant four years ago.
Hi.
Me go out with Ross?! No! God no! What would make you think that?
Alright, here you go my friend. Eggs a-la Eddie, huh?
Really! You-you sail?
Oh, you're sweet and cute.
These are my night vision goggles. This is the book I pretend to read when I'm watching her in the park. And these are Mad Lips, they're just for fun.
Ms. Green would like to establish some ground rules before she comes out. She would appreciate it if you don't use the words old or downhill or they still look pretty damn good.
Poo?!
Well I actually, I-I really, I haven't seen her for years. But umm, well I-I was pretty tight with-with her and her daughter.
I can't help it, I'm just, I'm just crazy about you.
Sure.
Y!
Sorry old boy, sorry. Sorry. Sorry. I could kill you with my thumb, you know.
So where did you study?
Yeah, it is! Naked Ross!!
Hola, Joey!
You mean they're lovers.
Yeah!
Car's waiting downstairs, I just wanted to drop off these copies of my book for your friends. Anything you want from Lisbon?
Oh, we're having spaghetti! That's.... easy.
OK, look, this isn't the first time somebody's said something to me about this, but, I don't know... I always made excuses about it, like... uhhh... 'I'm just a social drinker,' or, 'C'mon, it's Flag Day.'
No. See now I don't think you're being fair. I mean one night you see me and you get scared, I mean, what about all the other nights when you don't see me, huh? What about last night when you went and got a drink of water and I was nice enough to hide behind the door, what's that about, huh?
Yeah hey, you know if you want I can take you around back and show you where he hit his head on the rain gutter.
Who's party is it?
Let's take it from there.
Uhh, I can't.
Twenty-four actually.
Can I help you?
Yeah, not really. Babies are dull.
No, actually, um, we talked about Helen Willick-Bunch.
Okay, it'll take just a little while to prepare the embryos.
You're a strange kind of grown-up.
That he wouldn't pay for my lawyer! Then he told me to come here and learn about the value of money from the one daughter he's actually proud off.
Hi.
No! They did!
Y'know what? Strike that. My name uh, actually is-is Joe. Uh, Joe umm, Hill.
That's so exciting.
I'm fine! I'd fight tonight, if they'd let me. See this circle I'm marking off here? This is my zone of terror.
Hey, buddy! Are you familiar with Section 11-B of the Health Code that requires all refuse material out the back exit?
I can't imagine why.
I'm not coming back.
No, she's at a faculty meeting.
Hey, here's an idea. Why don't uh, I put the food in the fridge and we can eat it later?
You have me!
Yeah! You're saying, you need to be with someone more mature. Maybe someone with, a license to practice medicine. Or a mustache.
It's the basketball playoffs.
Now, that can be arranged! Slippery little bugger!
So umm, you feel like taking a test? There's only one question.
Oh!
Okay!
Yay!
OH...MY...GAWD!!
We're sorry honey, but we just assumed if you got married after you turned 30 you'd pay for it yourself.
I was gonna have Thanksgiving at my girlfriend's.
Daddy!
Why don't we try massaging the breast to stimulate the flow.
You made him a candle light dinner in the park?
Oh, sweety, you can't pull this off.
So uh, Monica is Ross's sister.
Hey, Chandler!
... no... bu but there was my first boyfriend Billy.
Okay, I know that I went to that all ready.
I can't believe that Ross is gone. It is just so sad.
Yeah.
I don't care. I am trying to get a person out of my body here, and you're not making it any easier.
Well, we were...
We just know she's got the IQ of a napkin.
