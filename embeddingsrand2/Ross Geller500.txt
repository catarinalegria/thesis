There it is.
Look, I do not re-love her.
Damn!
I want to go to the bathroom.
So Rachel, what're you, uh... what're you up to tonight?
Ah y'know, this building is on my paper route so I...
Oh yeah? Have you ever dated anyone who has been divorced three times?
Yeah, you're right.
Not only did we go out, we did it 298 times!
Pheebs, you're talking about putting your body through an awful lot, I mean morning sickness, uhh, labour, and it's all for somebody else!
I don't care about your dad! I care about Mona! She was there and now she's totally freaked out!
How did you know that?!!!!
Dad, she won't want to go with me.
What happened?
Actually, no, we're not.
Yeah I just hurt it.
You're nose is bleeding!
You'll see. Okay. Oh, what's-what's her name?
Hey!
Exactly!!
Yeah.
This is my wedding.
No, no, really. You should go. Just go! Go! Go out! Really, the world is your oyster. Kick up the heels. Paint the town red.
Carol our sex life is-it's just not working...
What's wrong? Are you okay?
Kristen Lang.
I don't know, I could maybe go out for a couple of beers, but there's this thing about bumblebees on The Discovery Channel that I was planning to watch.
Yes, we did, everything's A-OK!
Hello.
No, no. The vet says unless he's in a place where he has regular access to some... monkey lovin,' he's just gonna get vicious. I've just gotta get him into a zoo.
Hey! Guess what I got for your wedding!
Okay. All right. So let's see, let's play from the trash can, to the lightpost. Right. Two hand touch, we'll kick off.
I know.
Oh yeah, yeah, sure. Absolutely.
I get it! Well, that's that.
Yeah-yeah you guys. Get out of here!
Really? Did you count Mississipily?
Hey.
Well uh, I-I'm a paleontologist. Umm, I-I live in New York. I have a son Ben. Uh, hi Ben! And uh...
Phoebe, you can't get out of this! Okay? You have to learn how to ride a bike!
Well I checked in the uh, lost and found, I talked to the manager, no-one's turned them.
What? Ow!
So Joey, you okay?
Yeah, didn't I mention that? Yeah, I mean, we haven't being going out for too long, but rather there is thisamazing connection between us. I-I mean, in fact just before you came in she called me her boyfriend. I thought it wasa little too soon, but it was also, you know, it was kinda nice.
That's it? That's all you wrote? You're the worst writer in the whole world.
Hum...So...hum...Oh hey I noticed you were reading the paper...another flood in Europe? Here's a question: "Would you...would you rather drown or be burnt alive?"
If like the four of us could all y'know, hang out together. Uh, in fact Emily's coming into town this weekend, why don't you say we all have dinner? Say, Sunday night?
Can I use.. either thumb?
Hi.
Uhhhh... Joey cried last night.
...What shoe?
Hey, is Rachel here? Um, I wanted to wish her a happy birthday before I left.
So you don't wanna go to Williamsburg?
Yes it is. See.
You were backpacking across Western Europe?
Oh, come on, Rach, he's a guy!
Oh, hey, hey, I got that.
Yeah, well excuse me for wanting to be with my girlfriend on our anniversary, boy what an ass am I.
That was going to be my next argument.
What's up with the greed Joe?
Look at him. I'm not saying he has to spend the whole evening with me, but at least check in.
No, it's not a divorce, it is not a divorce! Anyway, I think Rachel and I need to, you know, get on with our lives, maybe, maybe start seeing other people.
I got tenure. I didn't win the lottery... Hey Rach, so uh... how did your thing go?
Weh...*sigh*
Oh! Oh! She's upside down but she's coming! She's coming!
Yep, we got it, we got it. Thank you so much.
And! Break!!
Chandler was hitting on the hot delivery girl!
Really, it would be good for you and in fact, why don't you, why don't you go ahead to the restaurant and I will wait for my mom and then I'll meet you there.
Wh-what's up?
Yeah, he's head of the department.
Okay, okay, okay, I've got two cabs and no people. Go! Go! Go!
Cool!
I prefer not to answer that right now, I'm still carrying a little holiday weight.
Thank you so much for coming back over.
Okay! You take care!
For your information, it's a card sharp, not a card shark.
Good.
I'm not gonna hit you.
Uh yeah! Let me, let me get that for you.
How come it's always us left in the field holding the ball?
You know, I hate to lecture you guys, but it's kinda disgraceful, that a group of well-educated adults and Joey can't name all the states. Did you ever see a map, or one of those round, colorful things called "a globe?" Hmm?
I whitened them.
...since I stopped trying.
What big thing?
Well, how about this year, instead of Santa, we have fun celebrating Hanukkah?
Yeah, see, we-we-we have to stop across the hall, because it's my sister. But, uh, uh y'know actually, growing up with a sister was nice because it really helped me understand women. Yeah, you-you should tell your friends that.
Ok, ok, number one: The way you cry at game shows. Number two: how much you love your friends. Number three: the way you play with your hair when you're nervous. Number four: how brave you are for starting your life over. Number five: how great you are with Ben.
I'm shipping out tomorrow.
Whoa! Hey! Whoa-whoa-whoa, you saw her breast?!
That's closer.
Wait a minute! Were you on a poster for gonorrhea?
He's not?
Oh, it's not so bad. Monica's gonna make potpourri! I think I'm gonna go wander out in the rain for a while.
What was Monica's nickname when she was a field hockey goalie?
Okay, is everybody clear? We're gonna pick it up...and move it. Now all we need is teamwork, okay? We're gonna lift the car...and slide it out. Lift and slide!
Look, I uh, I tried not to kiss her, okay?
Yeah, I know, so what? I mean, who's-who's to say? Does that me we-we can't do it? Look, huh, I was with Carol for four years before we got married and I wound up divorced from a pregnant lesbian. I mean, this, this makes sense for us. Come on! I mean, on our first date we ended up spending the whole weekend in Vermont! I mean, last night I got my ear pierced! Me! This feels right. Doesn't it?
Hi.
C'mon, cut. Cut, cut, cut,...
No I don't want to play video games, Joey!
I won't date. I'll uh, I'll be here, with you, all the time.
I don't know. But, you know, we, we have a lot in common, you know. He plays piano; I played keyboards in college. He's been divorced; I have some experience in that area.
Look, I know you don't want to hear this right now but, we've seen him in his new place, alright. And he's happy, he's, he's decorated.
Ok, we gotta go, yeah? So, we'll see you guys tomorrow.
Hey, could you do me a favour? Could you just grab me a bottle of water?
Hmm?
Oh I-, Oh wait, Tony can you hang on? That's the other line. Hello. Oh yeah she's here but uh, can she call you back? OK thanks. Call Joanna. Hi.
I don't know! I guess I just can't believe any of this is happening.
Okay. You uh, you wanna hear something weird?
Why?
Good evening, sir. My name is Ross Geller. I'm one of the people who applied for the apartment. And I-I realize that the competition is fierce but-I'm sorry. I, I can't help but notice you're naked and I applaud you. Man, I wish I was naked. I mean, this-this looks so great. That is how God intended it.
Yes. I'm... I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
Oh no!
Come here.
Chandler. I sensed it was you.
Oh no, I have plans with Elizabeth.
Dude, you didn't say Die Hard. Is everything okay?
Four hundred, huh? Well, that sounds do-able. How much are the boxes?
Hey!
Ok, fine, but I don't want them bonding to much. I don't want her telling Emma she needs a nose job.
Uh, what?
Yeah.
That's all right, Rach, we got the bags. Hi, hello. Julie, this is my sister Monica. This is Chandler. Phoebe. Joey, what up?
Hey, you guys!
Hey, thanks Rach.
Why are we in bed together?
If only he were a woman.
No. No, uh, Phoebs? You can'tyou can't do...
Okay.
Hey Joe, while you're over there how about another beer for the Ross-A-Tron?
Really?! I mean, even with the card?
What?
Keep pushing!
No! That's-that's my arm!
Actually umm...
And that's just the herbivores. I'm not even gonna discuss the carnivores, their heads are already too big. Which is ironic considering their stunted cerebral development.
But it absolutely didn't. It didn't!! It didn't!!
I can't believe I'm about to meet Benjamin Hobart. I've always thought of him as one of the people I'd invite to my fantasy dinner party. Do you think there's any chance he'll bring Christie Brinkley or C3PO?
Yes, yes, that's right...
No, I mean it's okay, I mean, they're-they're my friends. In fact, I-I-I was married to one of them.
That's it. I'm in my apartment, you're not there, we're not having this conversation.
Okay! Okay! But if she doesn't call, it is definitely over! No, wait. Wait. Unless, eventually, I call her, y'know just to she what's going on, and, and she says she'll call me back, but then she doesn't. Then it's over.
We're not alone.
That is really nice...lying! No way is that the reason!
What did you get?
Ooh, I, I'm so sick of missing stuff. Ya know, I want him for more than, than a day, I want him for a whole weekend. No listen , I mean, I feel like-
Hi.
Oh! Yeah.
No but...but still you can't possibly do this alone.
Huh? Oh-oh, it was fine. Uh, it was just a misunderstanding. She didn't want me to go with her. She just wanted to let me know that she's going to Florida for spring vacation.
Well, everyone's gotta kiss someone. You can't kiss Ross you got the history.
Of Ross and Rachel.
Boss!
You're gonna be an aunt.
Ok, but you know what? I gotta say, I'm really impressed that you were able to memorize all this so quickly!
Yay! And that takes what? Just six or seven minutes.
Is this about Mark?
Erica, those things aren't free. In fact they have one of the highest mark-ups of any consumer product...
Okay.
All right. I think it was a mouse.
Anyway, if she, if she wasn't in to me, why-why would she ask me out again?
Yeah, no one talks like that!
I can't believe they gave you a ticket. You're such a good driver.
Uh, nothing, nothing's with him. Enjoy your coffee.
Yes! Wow, well, that-that was easy. Okay, you-you go.
Tag? Y-You're going? Uh we didn't, uh we didn't get the chance to talk. Uh, so, where did you say you're from again?
I got it. So hi, I'm uh, I'm Ross and this is my friend Chandler.
Shut up! It was nice. I just... I don't think I'm the dirty-talking kind of guy, you know?
No! No! Wh... What are you doing?!! GET OFF MY SISTER!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I'm having... I'm having a baby. I'm having a... Where's the phone? The phone?
No, no. I-I'm good.
Well, as much as I'd like to meet Josh and warn him, Emily and I aren't going to be here. All right? I mean, she's going to come by first to say good-bye, and then I've got a whole special evening planned. So I'm sorry, no party.
Uhh, yeah. I mean, actually I kinda think that we'll have, we'll have two babies.
Ok. Well, before I say anything, I just need to know, is this one of those things where you break up with a guy, and then I tell you what I think, and then the next day you get back together with the guy, and I look like a complete idiot?
Dear Lord!!
Right.
Postpone it? Emily, do you think Monica realises how much our parents spent on this wedding? Do you my sister's teeny-tiny little brain comprehends that people took time out of their lives to fly thousands of miles to be here, huh? This isn't right.
Why?
Rach!
I wanna say it's not looking good.
Goodnight sweetheart! I love you. And remember, you're daddy's little girl... Phoebe's totally ruined that for me...
Sorry, I'm kinda keeping this one on the Q.T.
Hey! It's starting to snow.
I could put uh-uh a basketball court in the back.
Fine.
I will give you a call.
Dr. Green. How are you?
That must be our alcohol and beers!
It's okay man, be strong.
Yeah the dad and Ben eat soup and pretend to enjoy it.
Y'know what?! It doesn't matter! It doesn't matter what you believe! What matters is what happened!
Umm, would you like to dance?
Well, this is what happens when people live on the edge!
And we didn't have sex.
Wow.
No, I'll do it.
I'm telling you. I'm telling you. That's what it is. No wonder she was looking at me all funny during the wedding. She didn't say anything to you?
No. No, y'know you don't, you don't wear enough of this. What?
Look Emily, I'm just having dinner with my friends, okay?
Seven.
Hey! What's up?
Can I talk to you for a minute?
Hi, hi, I'm Ross Geller.
Yeah.
Well, I am going to, uh... get a beverage. It was nice, nice... uh... meeting you.
Oh what?! Is she gonna cancel on me again?! How can she do this? Doesn't she know it's our anniversary?
Yes, I do have a laundry room in my building, um, but there's a.... rat problem. Apparently they're attracted to the dryer sheets, and they're goin' in fine, but they're comin' out all.... fluffy. Anyway, say, sevenish?
No! I'll be right back.
Hey! So, uhh, Amanda just-just dropped me off. Yeah, that's one of the things I love about her, she's...uh, she's old enough to drive. So uhh, I guess you're not going to mom and dad's tonight?
Are you gay?
It's a day to be thankful.
What kind of research?
Hi! What are you, what are you doing here?
Why are they here?
Dear Mary-Angela. Hi. How's it going. This is the hardest letter I've ever had to write. What the hell's a matter with you? How do you think Joey's going to react when he finds out that you blew off his sister with a letter?
Okay. Well, apparently Chandler's angry at us for not getting him a ticket to that Knicks game a couple of weeks ago.
We'll see.
I wonder how I would react under fire, y'know? And not backfire but-but heavy fire, like I was in a war or something.
Pretty soon I guess.
No, I'm genuinely sorry the Mark thing didn't work out. Look, Rach, I want only good things for you.
Yeah!
Okay, guys, wish me luck.
Hi.
Huh!
...once you know the stories, it's not that bad. First marriage, wife's hidden sexuality, not my fault. Second marriage, said the wrong name at the altar, a little my fault. Third marriage, well they really shouldn't allow you to get married when you're that drunk and have writing all over your face, Nevada's fault.
Petty...
You don't have a valid driver's license-Okay that is it! Pull over right now!
One-Mississippi, two-Mississippi, switch! Switch! Switch!!
Noooo!!! Every time!!!
He's in! Oh, did you hear that, Marcel? San Diego. San Diego!
What?
Actually it's the movie theatre that has the time schedule. So you don't miss the beginning.
Yeah, that's how I know. I'm Ross by the way.
Uh-oh...
I'm here. How's my little boy? Want Daddy to change your diaper? So, did you have fun with Uncle Joey and Uncle Chandler today?
Plus tip, divided by six. Ok, everyone owes 28 bucks.
I mean, you just went out with my best friend, and I just think it'd be a really really bad idea. Or-or not!
Not for tonight. Not for tonight! Wh-what, what, what, are you doing?
It tastes like feet!
Yes.
No.
Hey.
Hey Mike sorry to just drop by like this, can I come in?
Uhh, yes I did but there isn't. Okay, here we go.
Shut-out!!
Uh-huh.
What?
Sometimes, you should come over sometime! I'll play you one of my other...
Ooooohhhh.
Okay. Yeah, I guess, I guess I could do that too.
I'm not getting you a muffin!
No... No... No. I think I should stay, I think we should both know whats going on.
Oh. Oh! Oh my God! Okay, I know this, give me-give me a second!
Well, John McLane had plans!
The gas is odorless, but they add the smell so you know when there's a leak.
Wow, it really is!
But the good news is, no one in a two-block radius will ever know.
I can't believe it. Can I tell you something? I'm a little mad at him now.
So uh, what did you tell them about me?
Why?
What? No! No, I'm not stopping. I'm Red Ross!
No way!
You'd better hope not because I just read what you put on your page today.
What are you doing?
Ahh, whoo-hoo!!
Cigarettes?!!
I have to talk to her about this groomsman situation, ok? I'm not gonna watch Chandler up there while I'm sitting in the seats like some chump! . Oh! My God! You're breathtaking!
Wow! I could've died tonight.
Ahhhh!!
Emma's down for the night.
And while that was good advice, you should know that what-what she wants...
Oh, I uh, just came by to pick up my skull. Well, not mine, but...Susan: Come in.
I just wanted to thank you again for last night, what a great party! And the guys from work had a blast. Y'know, one of them had never been to a bachelor party before. Yeah! And-and another one had never been to a party before, so...
No, Rach!
Dude!
The bathroom?
I do.
Oh, I hope they're not ruined.
Yeah.
No no no, believe me. No one has been waiting for this as much as I have, ok? And you know what the funny thing is? When this day is over, you get to go home with the baby, ok? Where does that leave me?
Hi, this is Ross Geller in suite 206. It seems you forgot a couple of things. Could you have some complimentary toiletries sent up to my room? Thank you! Ok. Toothbrush, toothpaste, razor, mouthwash, deodorant, dental floss, band aids, shaving cream, after shave... and I feel like I am forgetting something... Is there anything else you have that I haven't asked for already? Yeah, go ahead, send up some tampons. Ross: What did you get?
What, the word hi?
This is beautiful!
Things you find in the ocean, You're gonna be on "Pyramid"!!
Well, she'll call back, don't be such a baby.
Hey, hey, I'm your daddy. I'm the one without any breasts.
Yeah.
I think this will be fine. Okay, vanilla milkshake, just a vanilla milkshake, with chicken bits floating in it. Cheers.
What, that wasn't the great news?
I'm trying.
Why? What, what are you jealous?
Hey everyone!
Phoebe? Phoebe?
So this is an annual thing?
How rude.
Hi!
Smaller than that.
Yeah, what're you guys doin' here, aren't you supposed to be Christmas shopping?
Wha... what you really think we can do that?
Bec-Did you not hear me?! She's an assistant professor in the Linguistics department, okay? They're wild! Why do you want to come anyway?
Of course he is! What, do you think I'd just use my son as-as an excuse? What kind of father do you think I am?
He's unconscious, I think we'll be just fine!
I don't know if it's true.
Yeah.
Fun? Where was the fun? Tell me specifically, which part was the fun part? Where's my puck?
Well, I still think I was right about that whole Mark thing.
How do you think it's gonna look when you get her something incredibly meaningful and expensive and her boyfriend Joey gives her an orange?
What??
You're crazy.
Oh, hey, oh... I... I was-I was going for a hand shake.
I can't ask people to do that? Would you ask people to do that?
Look, I'm sorry.
So don't, I don't see why we have to go to this thing anyway, it's your ex-fiancee's wedding.
Are you kidding? Look, we're not gonna be together just because we're having a baby. Okay?
Thank you.
Aw come on, Mona Lisa?
I'm sorry, I don't believe contestants are allowed to talk to each other.
Look, I didn't think there was a relationship to jeopardise. I thought we were broken up.
Uh Dad, Emma's in the nursery. I'll take you now. If you want, but I really want to talk to you.
Ewwww!!
Oh, uh, can it wait a second Joey? I have to tell my parents something. No it can't? Okay.
Okay. Honey?
Shielding your face and shrieking like a girl... is not a backhand.
Gunther! Gunther. Gunther, please tell me you didn't say anything to Rachel about me and the girl from the Xerox place.
I don't know! Just-just talk to him-entertain him and keep him alive.
Yeah, we want everyone to be there. As much as I hate to delay your doing weird sex stuff to my little sister.
You don't want to believe me, I'm Mr. Funny to you. Mr. Funny...
He didn't get the goggles!
Yay!!
Okay.
Chandler's gonna ask Monica to marry him!
Oh. Hey, who's Carl?
You deserve to be with someone who appreciates you, and who gets how funny and sweet and amazing, and adorable, and sexy you are, you know? Someone who wakes up every morning thinking "Oh my god, I'm with Rachel". You know, someone who makes you feel good, the way I am with Julie. Was there a second of all?
What?
Hey Rach...
Hey!
Oh really? Did she tell you he plays the recorder, recites poetry and bakes Madeleines?
Hey, I hear she's single again, d'you think I should ask her out?
Hot dog?
He looks so tiny.
Ok, well, if you do take him out for his walk, you might wanna bring his hat, and there's extra milk in the fridge, and there's extra diapers in the bag.
What?
Ah...ooh! Well, looks like, uh, we kicked your butts.
Yeah...
"...and I'm a little bit rock 'n' roll"!
Oh, that's great, that is great!
Good, good, good. So, is uh, was your moustache, did, used to be different?
I really think they're out of rooms.
Pheebs? What, why are you whispering?
Oh my God! You actually exchanged it!
I'll be right down.
Actually she's a paleontology doctoral candidate, specializing in the centazoic era.
Hey you guys.
Hey. Rachel, I-I-I've been wanting to tell you something for a while now and I really, I just have to get it out.
Oh that is so great! That's...
So when I came in here to see if you wanted to maybe start things up again, you were engaged to my best friend.
You're right. Yours is worse. You are the king of bad Thanksgivings.
What? What?
I'm sorry. See that's the good thing about my job. All the dinosaurs on my table are already dead.
C'mon! Joey! What is it?
Bye-bye!
Right! Right! I just-I want you to know that I'm going to be there through this whole thing, okay? Okay? The doctor's appointments, the uh, the Lamaze classes, uh baby-proofing the apartment-Although we could probably worry about that 'til after we get married.
That little naked guy would be me.
Happy Valentine's Day! ...Or something to remember me by.
Yeah... Oh, great. More party boys for Chandler!
Gunther! Gunther. Gunther, please tell me you didn't say anything to Rachel about me and the girl from the Xerox place.
Fine.
Oh, mom. Mom. Chandler hates Thanksgiving and doesn't eat any Thanksgiving food.
Argue with that.
I think Chandler's gone.
Well, if you see him could you please tell him I'm looking for him?
Oh, you uh, you wanna hear a freaky coincidence? Guess who's doing laundry there too?
Come on Rach, you can't even eat alone in a restaurant.
No, no, I mean, I mean a thing on my body.
I-I-am-
Hey.
Me too!
Yeah.
No. No. No, I'm-I'm glad you did. Look, if nothing else, it's-it's always great when someone tells you they love you.
Hey, if there is ever, anything I can do for you...
Say something clever! Okay, doesn't have to be clever, it just has to be words. Say some words. Any words will do. Oh my God! This is the longest that anyone has not talked ever! There is nothing you can say to make this worse!! So just say something!! I-I, I uh haven't had sex in a very long time. Yeah, you really shouldn't have said anything.
It's not the best!
Who would you rather be Simon or Garfunkle?
Ok.
Mmm.
And what are you going to do for him?
You got me a cola drink?
Why should Ben step aside? It was his audition in the first place! You-you just tagged along! You're like the uh, tag-a-long dad.
Hey I uh just picked up Ben from school...
Easy.
Uh Joey, can you give us just a minute?
All right! All right! It was the best nap ever!
Hey, what do you think they're doing in there?
Yes, yes it is. In prison!
No, no, no just do it. Go in there and pick something out so we can go.
Come on! Like I wanted him to tell you, I ran all over the place trying to make sure that didn't happen!
Yes. And another time after that. Boy I'm getting hungry! Hey Joey, have you ever been so hungry on a date that when a girl goes to the bathroom you eat some of her food?
Oh thank you.
Oh my God!
Well I guess you can start by drivin a cab on Another World.
Oh, I'm no actor, I'm a professor of palaeontology. Joey: It's a science.
I'm trying to tell you I made you a mix tape.
Well did you try calling her?
Well, Monica keeps changin' the channel.
Yeah, yeah. You should come check us out. We're called "Way! No Way!".
Hey! She didn't look 50!
Well look, I'm just trying to focus on the "I get to see my wife," part, all right? And not the part that makes me do this.
No!
I had no idea. And that-that pillowcase thing, I thought you guys were just doing the flying nun.
Chandler, I want you to run a post pattern to the left, okay. And sweetie..
No! No we don't!
Oh my god, crap from the street?
Yeah, but you were the one who got him back, y'know? You, you were great. ...Hey, we uh, we still have that, uh, that bottle of wine. You in the mood for, uh, something grape?
No, NO! Look, I need to talk to Joey. I mean, you guys just broke up. Before anything more happens between us, I need to know he's okay with it.
Nuh, uh, the moment's gone.
Ah, must've been fairly obvious since it was the only thing left in your store.
Look at you! You're up!
Noooo.
Damn! I thought that was going to be romantic as hell!
Now I'm depressed! ... Even more than I was.
It was you, pal.
Good, 'cause I love you.
I guess so.
How could I forget?
What? I'm kidding. You know I'd never let him touch the Porsche.
I'm feeling better.
Hey! So, how was Atlantic City?
Huh.
Hello.
That's alright. Listen, listen.
Yes!
I'm really glad we came. You're so pretty. I love you.
So uh, have a great time down there.
So, what are you guys doing four weeks from today?
Yeah, Susan.
All right. A room. A man enters, he looks suspicious. That's it? Joey, you're supposed to have five pages done by now! Including an exciting incident! And what is, and what is all this?! The official rulebook of Fireball.
What?
All right, maybe it means that too...
What? She's gonna eat all those cookies?
Oh.
I know and yet here you are all ready for the next date.
And you didn't marry him because...?
Yeah, i-it's for the museum. Someone found a bone, we want the bone, but they don't want us to have the bone, so I'm going over there to try to persuade them to give us the boit'sit's a whole big bone thing.
