Did he call? Did Mark call?
Oh yeah, nothing! These are happy tears! This is just what I wanted.
Well, it is, all right? When we were out there today, all I kept thinking was: I can't believe Chandler is screwing this woman, but MAN this would be a nice place to live!
Huh?
Joey!
Oh God, I really had a good time!
What are you reading?
You have a son!
Wiper blades. I don't even have a car.
Oh, him, the little guy? Oh, I love him!
My boss, Joanna? Wow, that must've been awkward.
I'm sorry?
Oh God, oh, and then she told the funniest story...
That is the Coast Guard.
That would be great!
You were gonna propose to me?
Yeah!
Oh.
What is my sister doing there?! And why are the drapes shut?!
Hi you guys.
..so, he said it was just a sprain, and that was it.
Oh, stop that! Don't kid about that! Will all the stars be there?
Yah! She's... uhm... not very good though...
You went shopping?! What, and then you just came in here and paraded it right under Jill's nose when you know she's trying to quit. Wow, you guys are terrible!
What's your problem?
Ow ow ow. Ow ow ow. Ow ow ow.
There you go!
Don't say anything. I don't wanna speak, I don't wanna think. I just want you to take me and kiss me and make love to me right here, right now.
Wow, I really get crabby when I cook.
Really?
Ethan called again.
Yes, you have to get her something, and it should be something really nice.
Okay. Oh, uh, wait a minute, y'know what? I uh, I can't decide this. Umm, okay, just hold on a second.
James Brolin?
It's just some things I've been thinking about. Some things about us, and before we can even think about the two of us getting back together, I just need to know how you feel about this stuff.
Come on you gotta have one!
Excuse me. Hi.
So, how are you?
Oh! Oh! Can I give out the candy? I really want to be with the kids right now. Y'know, ever since I got pregnant I-I have the strongest maternal instincts.
Oh honey, but you love that name.
Here you go.
Oh! Look! I have a sonogram picture!
Coffee.
Ah.
Ross?
Hi! Tag. What are you doing here?
Yeah, it's in there.
Hi!
Uh-huh. No, I hear what you're saying and-and-and that makes a lot of sense but can I just say one more thing? Look how pretty!
Yes, Joey, I remember, she's annoying, but you know what she's-she's his girlfriend now. I mean what can we do?
