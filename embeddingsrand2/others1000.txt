So what do you want me to do, you want me to be more negative, less happy?
No but he didn't really talk about anything.
So based on your petition you are seeking an annulment on the grounds that Mr. Geller is mentally unstable.
Oh yeah, but I can stay out as late as I want.
Phoebe, it's okay that you feel this way. I mean it is soon. And there's a lot of things we don't know about each other, and I just figure that everything I really like. And the things I don't know, I get to learn about at someplace with both our names on the mailbox.
All right, there was none. Let's talk signing. You be noisy girl number one, you be noisy girl number two.
I'm adopted?
It's Allesandro, from Allesandro's.
What'd you think I was, a hooker?
That's great!
You thought I was Rachel?
Oh no-no, I-I had my eyes closed so I could concentrate and y'know take it all in.
And he was my best student.
I was just being polite, but, alright.
You were amazing out there.
Oh, shut up. You know, it's a rebuilding year. You... waah!
Why?
How?
Your mother just added him to her list.
Mmmm... Ethan is my... boyfriend.
I think I accidentally used Monica's boxes to keep the water away from the Porsche.
Oh, hi.
So is that a bedroom?
Oh it's nothing, it just says that you can't sue the city if you scrap your knee or y'know, get your head blown off.
Are you all right?
Clever. So how are you?
Oh, by the way... I'm awesome!!
What? Do you think he likes me?
Okay, all right. Let's do it. And...Action!
When's your birthday?
Okay...
What?
"Bastard"!
Stop!
This is for the fourth grade.
Wait! Wait! Listen! Listen to this! Y'know what I wanted to be when I was that age?
No, it's, it's more of a fifth date kinda revelation.
The numbers we are seeing New York, Chicago, and London are consistently solid, but many of our officers have reported disappointing fields.
No, you can't use your watch.
It took you that long to figure it out, huh?
Because I was told I'd get a free dinner, which I didn't. And that I'd meet a pretty girl. Which I did.
Oh shoot! Maybe next time. Thanks for a lovely evening.
Wha-, n-, no. I mean it's just a bunch of pretty people runnin' around on the beach, ya know.
Howard's the handy man!
And finally, our biggest item of the night, the 22-foot gentleman's day sailer sailboat. The winning bid was a whooping $20,000!
I know, I probably shouldn't even tell you this, but I'm pretty much totally intimidated by you.
I want one.
Wa-wa-wa-wait! Congratulations! You did it! You did it! You can relax now. Yeah.
Hello?
All right, who should we call first, your folks, or Deb and Rona?
What do you mean?
What do you know about love?
What are you doing here, Geller?
Hi.
Hey, can we get some cappuccino over here?
Oh! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Yes! Thank you!
Thanks. Maybe I'll see in the spring, with the uh, y'know, for the uh, bathing suits.
Yeah, what's the gala for?
This is so much fun, just the girls. You know what we should do? Does anybody have any marijuana?
I used to be Bryce on All My Children.
Yeah, I'm riding the alimony pony.
I think you should talk to Ross about all this.
What do you think?
L!
Hey guys.
Have you felt Rachel's cervix Ross?
I see. Have you considered therapy?
Oh honey! This is so exciting! I thought we screwed you up so bad this day would never come. Oh and just think. Soon there'll be lots of little Bings.
I'm pregnant.
No. If I can't have your clams, you can't have my dessert. This is a two way street.
Oh my God! Someone, he's choking. Is anyone here a doctor?
Australia, I just moved here a couple of weeks ago.
That's weird.
Do you have any question for Erica?
Umm, look I-I-I got a confession to make...
Sooo, Richard's shopping in the junior section.
Oooh it's getting close!
Oh, oooh. I'm sorry. You are not allowed on the jetway unless you have a boarding pass.
Okay.
Alright.
Stop it!
She, now I knew that and...now I'm sweating. Look at me, I'm really sweating-Now I'm saying, "Look at me," I'm getting even sweatier. I think I probably should go.
What?!
Well, the biggest news is still you dumping Barry at the altar!
You can't sit here if you're not gonna play.
Hey.
Yeah.
Yeah, he's the handy man. He's gonna be retiring next week and everyone who lives here is kicking in a 100 bucks as a thank you for all the hard work type of thing.
Well uh, do either of you smoke?
...so I've been slowly phasing out the wine importing and focusing more on the cheese side of things.
I know! I almost called off my wedding. Oh, who's your band?!
That was...so good.
I got beer.
Surprise!
Yeah well, being that he was the victim, they're usually pretty talkative.
So I understand you're looking for a place.
I didn't ask. You wanna come in?
Yeah, they teamed us up as partners. Joey picked three scenes for us to do; all of them had us making out.
Yeah, really.
Well, I don't need you to help me, because I already know what I'm going to do with my life.
Excuse me?
Oh my gosh, that was so lame. Like a pajmena could be a rug!
Oh...
'Cause every time I see your face, I can't help but fall from grace. I know.....
Oh my God, does she really thinks that?
That's great! That's great! I-I'll propose to her!
Night Mon. Night Julio.
This is... great...
Yeah.
Have fun.
What a nice surprise! What are you doing here?
I'm sorry Mr. Geller. But ya know, there's an old saying, 'Sometimes monkeys die.' It's not a great saying but it certainly is fitting today.
Umm, nothing. I mean, I'm getting married next week.
So, who's the lucky guy?
Wait-wait! You're umm, you're a potato...
Comin' through. Move, move.
No. What ever happened to that little dude. So full of dreams...
It's so nice to finally meet you!
Hello.
These got left for ya.
What is this place?
What is with you tonight?
You're kidding me!
Whoa, you are very beautiful.
I'm not giving concert tickets to someone who'd use their son like this!
Yes.
Are you rehearsing for some really bad mafia movie?
No-no-no, we'll move you just stay right there.
Ah, sir a ticket to Yemen is $2,100 and we don't take library cards.
Yay!
Honey, relax. Ross is great with him. Don't look so surprised. I'm a lovely person.
Thank you.
Great! Dad! Thank you so much, I'll be back to pick him up in an hour.
I'm pregnant.
Are you being British?!
It's to my apartment.
This is a hospital.
Wow, you have really pretty feet.
How, how can you be here and there.
You're making a big mistake here. I mean, San Diego's all well and good, but if you give him to me, I'll start him off against a blind rabbit and give you twenty percent of the gains.
Rachel, ready or not, here comes your knight in shining-Oh no.
So it seems like you have a lot of friends, who would you say is your best friend?
I'm ready for more.
Oh gosh, Lily, yes. Of course I remember Lily. I... Then you must be?
Uh, we've just gotten a call from Rachel, and she told us what Ross did. It's pretty appalling, and Ross, if you're listening, I don't wanna play your song anymore. Why don't we devote our time to a couple that stands a chance? Avery, Michelle's sorry she hit you with her car and she hopes you two will work it out.
Oh I...I think they're funny.
Thank you.
How would you characterize the theme of this book, uh let's see here , Rachel Green?
Oh, that-that would be great. So you didn't even get to Italy?
Oh?
Me go out with Ross?! No! God no! What would make you think that?
Kinda.
Here let me...
So, who's the mystery man?
Hi Mom, it's Jill.
Hey. Hey where's the baby?
Oh yes! You're an excellent chef! As a person you're a little...
No. Nothing. Imagine, if she had just stepped off that curb a few seconds later.
Hey, Joey.
Hi!
Aww, like I could hurt you. Are you making fun of my size? Don't make fun of me because of my size!
Joe, I tried to wait until I was 25 like you did!
She's checking the coats. Joey, I'm gonna go wash the cab smell off my hands. Will you get me a white Zinfandel, and a glass of red for Janice.
I don't know. I don't remember a lot of things that never happened.
Thanks a lot. Hey Christine, I got it!
Okay. All right uh, Alex now when Joey says his line, "Take good care of your Momma son," that's your cue to cry. Got it? All right, let's do this.
I'm gonna go talk to uh, a friend.
Right, at the end, you choked on a cookie.
Well, any contribution, large or small, is always appreciated.
Yeah. Maybe it's for the best. You smell just like her.
Adios.
Hey! There you are!
No! No!
Really?!
I wasn't thinking. I was too busy fallin'...
Diet Coke.
Yeah.
Okay.
Ohh. Like what?
I'm sorry it didn't work out between you and me, or you and me. Drew was very disappointed.
What?
It's just hard when I know I have e-mail I can't get!
Right. Right. Ross. So what's the deal with you guys? I don't want to get in the middle of anything.
Do you?
Okay, so...no toner today. Thanks anyway, bye-bye.
I thought you wanted to adopt your cat.
Seriously, your dad doesn't like pranks.
Stuck at school. Some parent-teacher thing. You can go. I'll get the information.
Uh-oh!
I just sold it to that gentleman.
Push, push!
We love you. Buy.
Hi! What-what're you doing here?
I hate you!!
Umm, yeah, actually, Susan's gonna be home any minute, it's kinda an anniversary.
I'm moving in.
Hey, anybody want to meet a hero?
'Despair fills the mattress showroom. My kingdom is suddenly without a queen. I'm so depressed I'm going to slash... my prices!! Check it out! Four ninety-nine for a pillow top queen set! I'm going medieval on prices!
Nice party.
You crossed the line. Joey, describe for Gene these things that have lines. Give me 20 seconds on the clock, please. Ready, go!
They have a game room downstairs! Ping pong and stuff.
Oh Drake, you are so talented, let me see those hands. Oh these hands, these beautiful hands, oh I could just eat them. . . but I won't.
Hey, Pheebs.
Ross, whose glasses are those?
Oh, I was gonna talk to him about doing something tonight.
"A donation has been made in your name to the New York City Ballet".
You're dying?!
No, I don't know him.
No, I'm okay.
Cool! I-I'll see you then.
Ahh, the bat. Ambassador of darkness, flitting out of his cave like a winged messenger, sightless spectre of the macabe.
Yeah. We'd go to the science lab after hours!
Still rolling, annnnd action!
Hi, but I'm not here, you haven't met me. I'll make a much better first impression tomorrow when I don't have 20 hours of cab and plane on me.
I realise that people are going to be disappointed. But, I'm sure they'll come back when we can do it right.
Mockolate. It's a completely synthetic chocolate substitute.
How-how I like to melt stuff, and how I dislike stuff that doesn't melt.
Oh.... my.... God.
My name is Precious.
Oh believe me, I-I-I've been there. I had to sort mannequin heads at that Mannequins Plus.
What're we looking at? That blue freckle?
Joey, Ross is gonna be here any second, would you mind watching Ben for me while I use the ladies' room?
Uh actually, I'd like to speak with both of you.
Really! Now this all better be here when I come back.
Phoebe, will you marry me?
We have great news!
Thank you! . I can't believe that you chose this restaurant! Do you remember the night?
I'm pressing, a policeman is on his way.
I'm sorry Amber. It's just like Brad to have to have the last word.
Monica! Where are you from?
Oh it's great, it's a role on All My Children, Nick the boxer.
Oh, sure. Yeah, well, he was my high school boyfriend. Captain of the football team, really cute and he got a scholarship and went off to college.
What does Rachel see in this guy? I love Rachel. I wish she was my wife.
Really Mr. Geller, you don't have to do this.
What?
Uh, public display of affection coming up. You can avert your eyes.
You wanna know why. You wanna know why?
Why?
How do you spell that? So we can get it right.
So I was wondering....
But... I-I-It's nice... A-a-and... nice is good. A-a-and good is not bad, ergo, w-w-we should keep kissing.
You're kidding me. Because I'm not seeing anybody, I've just totally made that up.
Gosh, Ross, you know, you seem a little...
Oh, thanks for the tip.
Any luck?
Uh-huh. Is it dirty?
I am Julio.
Nice to see you Rachel.
Ah Monica, my star student.
Hey, what are you kidding me?
Hey you guys!
Oh, no, no. Not Leslie. No, she's, she's the only one that knows how to burp the alphabet.
Tribbiani! Hold on, I'll get the plunger.
Hey, my favorite part is coming up!
Y'know why? She's got the Christmas bonus list in there. I saw her working on it this morning.
Woah, woah, no wait a minute now. C'mon it's your turn. Oh c'mon. Ya know, I don't need the actual number, just a ballpark.
Well our service is not grossly incompetent.
All ticketed passengers for Flight 1066 to Athens should now be on board.
That's great! Hey! Excellent!
Oh, that's so great! Okay, I'm really gonna do this! I don't know how to thank you guys.
And once again she is out of here. Okay who had 9:45? Um?
I did not!
So don't do it, it's fine. You don't have to do it just because Susan does it.
Hello.
Ooh... Dr. Geller!
He'll be here OK, take a chill pill.
Oh right, that Rachel chick from the coffee place.
I got you...these.
All right, stop! You know, all Phoebe has done tonight is trying to get you to like her. And maybe that hasn't been clear all the time, but she did her best. And yeah... She's a little different than you are...
Anyway, I just wanna give you a heads up.
Oh hi. It's, it's Mark.
All right. This is the kitchen.
Oh, sorry, I didn't realize.
Mmm. Bob Buttons. Here, Bob Buttons.
Ohhhh. Relax, take it easy buddy. Tell me twice, you want me to go? Alright, alright, guess I'll be back for my stuff. But if you think for one second I'm leaving you alone with my fish, you're insane Jack!
Ew, y'know what? One time I saw this guy from behind and he seemed like a totally normal guy and then he turned around and it was Stephan Baldwin!
Is this about me taking your watch?
Phoebe's right Frank. I know it's hard to hear, but it would've been wrong to go through with it. I-I-I was being selfish, even though we, we want the same things now, in the future we may not. Is that it, is that what it is?
I wish I could talk to her.
Are you for Hanukkah, too? Because I'm part-Jewish.
Cut! Very nice people!
Hi.
That's my monkey. That's Patti, Patti the monkey.
Oh, I'm sorry. I'll take this. Excuse me.
Just a sec. Hope you find your monkey.
I mean, how hard can it be? Y'know, I mean, y'know, babies, y'know who doesn't want babies right? And besides y'know, I never had a Dad around, and ah, now-now I always will, 'cause y'know, it'll be me. Right?
Hi.
Hey, how's my favorite parenting team doing?
Well, then it's not on the wall yet.
All ticketed passengers for Flight 1066 to Athens should now be on board.
I'll take "You crossed the line".
Happy?! Is that what I'm supposed to be Vic? Happy?
July. Umm,
You stole my moves.
This is nice.
Well, it's not out here. Is there any chance it could be in your office?
You have all the answers, don't you?
Well, I went over to Kyle's last night to pick up a few things and we got to reminiscing...
Good job.
Is this cool, huh?
Oh, don't worry I have plenty of sun block, it's SPF-30.
Ah, just some basic dehydrating of a few fruits and vegetables. MAN ALIVE this thing's fantastic!
Dr. Geller, will you dance with me?
Please, can't you help me out?
Her name's Ann, she's a journalist. Ahh, we met on the plane. She asked me if she could finish off my peanuts, I thought she said something else, we had a big laugh. Yeah, I just, I mean I got, I got tired of waiting.
Yeah, a Pretty Huge...
Ross, you remember Susan.
That he wouldn't pay for my lawyer! Then he told me to come here and learn about the value of money from the one daughter he's actually proud off.
Oh. Well, I wish I could say no, but you can't stay my assistant forever. Neither can you Sophie, but for different reasons.
I'm Rhonda, and these aren't real!
You would think.
Listen, um about the hair straightener, honey.. I really need one. I'm going to have dinner at my boyfriend's house.
Ahh, I'm afraid I have some bad news. Marcel has passed on.
I'll never remember all of that. So uh, what's the deal? Rachel comes home, people pop out and yell stuff, is that it?
You got sprayed with two two' s and...
What about Benitez?
Maybe.
Good.
Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine.
It's too late, all we can do now is sow up the wound.
I'm sorry?
Oh, we're having spaghetti! That's.... easy.
Oh yeah, I'm so excited, I've never been there.
Maybe nobody won the jackpot, but there was this guy in here earlier, and he found the ticket on the street, right outside, and won $10,000 .
You okay, kiddo?
Well, that's sort of a given, but yes. Anyone else?
No! It's my fault. I keep trying to propose in these stupid ways and all I wanna do is tell you that I love you and I want to spend the rest of my life with you.
What is, honey?
Yeah, is she really 20.
Good, good, life is good...
Dear?
Phoebe, hang on a second. Here, take my car, go pick up your friends.
Uh, plate?
Phoebe's got another job, right?
Huh, I would've thought it was the other way around.
Now I do.
Interestingly... no.
We may not have any weapons, but we still have food. In the basement I saw potatoes and some dry pasta, and a few tins of tuna!
Sipowicz? No, I don't think so.
no it's not ringing any bells.
Unfortunatly the only thing we have available is our deluxe suite, the rate is six hundred dollars.
I'm telling you, you never gave them to me.
Yeah, well, he is a brilliant man.
No, no, no. We were there last night. She kept... ..bringing swordfish. are you gonna go to the, um?
I'm just taking you outside!
Yeah, I've been coming here since I was a kid. This used to be my Grandma's.
Wait, this is important! Can Ella wait?
Oh. Speaking of whom, I hear he's got some 20-year-old twinkie in the city.
Ahh, yes.
Well, I don't know what to tell you dear. The only thing I can think of is that she always used to say that before she died, she wanted to see everything.
Oh, wow. I can't believe you're throwing that in my face.
So, how's it going?
Well if you where ever enter the Loire valley let me know, I've got a great little villa you can stay at.
Hey, Phoebe.
Go! Come on! Roll!
Okay, okay.
"Oh, you sick bastard!"
That's right, The I Hate Rachel Green Club!
Oh yeah, let's do that!
... all these coasts having beautiful weather. In New York, it's 72 and sunny!
Look, I just wanted to have coffee with Rachel.
Yeah, yeah, let me show you around. This is the uh, downstairs living room.
I don't want to look at your file! This is over.
So what about us? Everything we feel for each other.
I am Mike.
Like your sweater.
So you work at Bloomingdale's, huh? My mom calls it Bloomies.
I-I can't believe this! You-you've slept with him?!
I know. OK, I wasn't completely honest with you when I told you that, uh, I didn't know exactly where he lived.
Y'know what? It doesn't matter! Because it is not true!
Oh I, I have plans tonight.
Ooh! Are you sure?
As my lawfully wedded wife, in sickness and in health, till death parts us.
Yes!!
I'm so sorry!
So, I'll call you tomorrow.
See you later Rach.
You know, I rarely connect with someone this much on the first date.
We kinda need to talk.
You miss your girlfriend?
What do you think of adding him to our team?
Hey, so what'd I miss, what'd I miss, c'mon?
When I was six years old.
Two years.
I know! I know! And then you lose your apartment! And then you lose your job! And then your ex-wife gets married so fast! And now the coffee-ahh!! Ross, we need to talk.
Good. Now imagine your vagina is opening like a flower.
Hey, no way, I'm in the shot man.
Well, I think this is a great place to work!
Oh God, we just clicked! Y'know how people just click? Like he came by to pick me up, and I opened the door, and it was just like, click! Did he tell you?
What?
I don't think so.
Pleased to meet you.
Wow, Monica, if every restaurant is as clean as yours, I'd have a tough time making a living.
Come in.
No.
Wait a minute! Take your pants.
Well, she was leaving work and she was hit by a cab.
That's true.
Hey, Chandler! What are you doing here?
Ok, you really want me out?
What's going on Bing? Does uh, your wife have a problem with me or something?
Now listen, not that you guys could stop me or anything cause you know you'd be dead. I was thinking about changing her name. I'm just not really a big fan of Emily.
Do you ah, currently own a set of encyclopedias?
Right.
Where have you been?
Yes.
Oh, that does sound. . .Ahh.
Wow. He's strict.
Well, we did a little more than that.
Ross!
Um, we should go too, I got patients at 8 in the moring.
Chandler?
Absolutely, yeah!
Hi. Hi.
So, you wanna get a hamburger or something?
So, what are you guys in the market for? We've got uh, scarves, tulip post cards...
We'd better take these pants off upstairs or that stain's gonna set.
That's one way! Me, I- I went for the watch.
Oh?
What, you hired the same band I can't use the same speech. Thank you, thank you very much. Anyway, I wish you both a wonderful life together. And Rachel...
Here, sweetie, here. I took these when I had my golfing accident.
Well, at least I'm not a murderer!
Oh, well, is it what we thought it would be?
Well, you just asked if I wanted to go to bed with you tonight.
Huh?
I don't speak English.
Hi!
The next one's dedicated to Rachel from Ross. Rachel, he wants you to know he's deeply sorry for what he did and he hopes you can find it in your heart to forgive him.
Yeah? Well, there's a lot of things Carol never did before I came along.
So you really think those newspapers are just jealous of me?
Hi. Is this your first?
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Awww!
What?!
But they're so dull, they're all opthamologists.
I can't help it, I'm just, I'm just crazy about you.
Not once.
Are you sure, because we may have something at Louis Vuitton.
Hey, what do you want to drink?
Over here Jack. OK. I see, Rachel's coming up the path. Oh doesn't she look pretty. Jack, get this.
I think I saw Rachel out in the hall.
Wow, excuse me, sir, do you have a boarding pass?
Do you?
Where?
Look, um I really appreciate your coming down...
All right, all right, if you insist on doing this, at least let me help you.
Oh, the woman upstairs is very nice. She and her husband have two kids, he's on Wall Street and she...
The bathroom is down the hall, to your left.
Uh, listen Bing, I received your memo. So, we're not gonna receive the systems report until next Friday?
You ready to go?
Hi.
Ah, no it's not. I've got picture-in-picture here. Yeah. Yeah, okay. I'm gonna have to call you back later. Monica? You. I'm gonna have to call you back.
It's the Gellers!
I...I don't care about fashion! I'm pregnant! And I know you are too, so you gotta help me!
I'm sorry, what?
Amen!
Have a seat son. Hey!!
So basically this is very easy. You read from the script and try to sell as much toner as you possibly can.
Uh, yeah. Now you guys dance over there, you guys over there, and I want you two right around here, and everyone else spread out.
What?!
Oh, me too...
Tell me.
You're welcome.
Ohh! Didn't know! Okay!
The picture of my wife! In your pack!
Hi, I'm Sally. So, no ring. Can I assume you are also a single parent?
Yeah, come on in.
I was gonna have Thanksgiving at my girlfriend's.
Oh man!!
We do five because that gives you a 25% chance that at least one will attach.
I'd be happy to. You are very sweet.
Hello, I am Guru Saj--Whoa!! That's supposed to be a duck right? 'Cause otherwise, this is waaay out of my league.
Oh well, um, your, your laundry just smelled so good, that I thought I'd curl up in it. Is that all right?
Oh god, don't tell me, I did it wrong.
It's coming! It's coming!
Ah well, I-I'm seeing someone.
Oh? Really? That's what my daughter means to you? Nothing?
Have to...
Right there! That's my car! Hey!!
So you're up for keynote speaker! Who's making the decisions?
Have we talked about the possibility of multiple births?
Why?
I'm not freaking out.
Such a sweet woman.
Uh huh.
Well, we're starving, why don't we all go get something to eat?
Sorry.
Well, goodbye Chandler. I had a great blackout. See ya.
Five more seconds.
Ow, ow, ow, ow, leg cramp, leg cramp, leg cramp.
No dear, that's what babies do.
Oh. God, crazy Chandler. He spun me...off...the...bed!
What?! They wanted a scary story!
Yeah.
No no no. Talk... dirty.
Oh, Chandler, look. You and Monica are meant to have children. I am sure it's gonna be just fine.
Oh yeah yeah, thank God you were here to oversee all the kissing!
Oh great! I'll keep it in my butt with your nose.
I believed you were saving this seat for someone.
Awesome!
You wrote that you have a cute touchie?
Oh yeah, well who serves steak when there's no place to sit, I mean how are you supposed to eat this?
Yes I do!
I just, I want you to know I didn't used to be like this. Before I meet your sister I was like this normal guy who sold beepers and cellular phones.
That's great!
Some guys are just lucky I guess.
Hey.
Ooh. Ooh. But ya know what would be even sexier?
Wow!
I would love your autograph.
Oh!
Okay. Okay.
It's this way? Sorry.
All right, I need a clamp, sterile towel, and channel 31.
I want you to move in with me.
And you tell him no one takes advantage of the Gellers.
No, no, that's just Chuck Magioni, I-I sold him a house last year! And I'm very sorry, but I don't know where your Father is, and that's the truth.
Awww.
Not so much, no. He had clearly memorized all the stuff to say, and some of it didn't even make any sense.
Monica bang!
Oh, thank god, it's not Mitzi. It's just a rat.
Then, you're redoing it because...
Three.
Wow.
So would it, would it make you feel better if I said I was very, very sorry that I left?
I just left you a message! Ross and I were gonna go grab a bite, but now that you're here, maybe we can go have that dinner.
Phoebe, you don't have to say that.
Rachel! Rachel!
excuse me?
It's a diaper genie.
Honey.. you should always feel the thing. Listen, if that's how you feel about the guy, Monica, dump him!
Hey Chandler, here's this morning's projections.
I think you'll like it, it has two out of the three tenors.
Suddenly, I very aware that I'm naked.
Okay.
Okay...
Yeah well, at least now people will know she is a girl!
Oh, fine. I'm leaving for New York tomorrow, which I hate- but I get to see my son, who I love...
And we kinda figured about the porch swing.
And...Action!!
Doesn't it make her nose look smaller?
Really?
So uh, I'm on my way back to the bathroom.
Well, I was probably going to do it at some point.
Are you all right?
That's great.
Eh, he said, thank you very much, he thinks you look very pretty tonight, your hair, golden like the sun. So you're a chef?
Oh! Oh! The usher must be right! What, with all that training they go through! Get out!! Here! Hey man, you want the aisle?
Joanna passed away last night.
No.
Well, if you're one of Ross's best friends, why aren't you here?
No, I'm getting it. I'll be right back.
3-B!
Great! I'm looking forward to it. Rachel, any messages?
Did you bring the toe?
Yeah...
We agreed on Minnie.
Oh that's all right, I'm coming back later with your father.
But there was no flash.
Hey.
No.
Yeah.
Please, stay on the line. Your call is important to us.
That's cool. But... but if you do, I'm gonna need three days notice.
Hey!
Actually, you know, uh, I gotta show this apartment tomorrow and uh, you know, this no faces thing might not be a bad idea.
A surfer.
It's hard isn't it? There's almost no time for a social life. I mean, where are you gonna meet someone?
He would like to kiss you.
Because we can remember them.
Well, remember how I was trying to achieve the positronic distillation of subatomic particles?
I-I gotta say, I-I-I-I'm not too sure I agree with that.
I!
We're still rolling!
You're stomping. It's disturbing my birds.
Oh yeah! Come on! Yeah right!
Yeah, right.
So, let's talk about women. I'm sure our female readers will be interested to know about your romantic life.
I can't do that!
Hey uh, I don't mean to be presumptuous but I have these two tickets to the ballroom dancing finals tomorrow night if you want to go?
Oh, please, we're happy to help.
Do I?
Do I know why we're rushing?
Okay... Good luck.
Knick fan?
Thanks for going along with this.
Stupid Jack, the word is stupid.
Well, um, for the past few years I've been working.. ...which is funny because, that wasn't even my major.
Hey! I got a kid starting college. I've to get surgery on my knee, you just lost me ten grand!
Hey, do you need me to pick you up?
Is that my ass?
Yes, Waltham interiors.
Not on purpose, he ricocheted of you and got me.
Oh?
No, I'm leaving to get my hair dyed.
But like how?
Oh, no! This is work. I should call in. Can you excuse me?
Oh, that was the blind date that I told you about, she called and switched it to today.
Oh, who's this little guy?!
Yeah, we loves 'em. I've never seen him with-
Yes, because that's how long it takes to love me.
What are you guys doing?!
Who's next?
I can write an epic poem about this lip.
You guys make me fly! High! Okay, we're gonna pick it up here, tomorrow.
All right, man!!
Hi Rachel!
Drake, look out.
Cool, alright. So maybe, ya know, I could give you a call sometime, we could talk or somethin'.
Hey.
Yeah, y'know I feel like I can really talk to you 'cause y'know you're my sister, y'know.
Hey, mind if I use the phone?
Joey!
Joey Tribbiani. Yes, ok. Hold on. She wants to talk to you. Take the phone.
I don't like looking foolish. Y'know what? Maybe uh, I don't arrest you today. Maybe I came by and you weren't here.
Well, I mean what can I say? I, I was married to Barbara for 30 years. She was my high school sweetheart, now you, that's two.
Hi Frank.
Hi.
Oooh, that sounded like a bad one.
You need these books.
Diary.
Thanks.
No, it's only been six years. I just wanted to put a nice memory in your head so you'd know that I wasn't always such a terrible guy. ...Joe. Y'ever been in love?
What?
So ah, there was this thing I wanted to talk to you about.
Uhm... Ha ha!
I mean, come on, buddy, get a real car!
Okay, I bought a boat.
He can have his job back.
Uh-oh-okay. Uh-oh-okay. I know what you all are thinking. But Chandler is in Yemen! I'm a young woman! I have needs! I can't wait forever!
Oh, hey, don't do that! Cut it out!
All right, I was 15, it was my best friend, Ruth, and we got drunk on that hard cider, and then suddenly, I don't know, we were, we were making out.
Now, do you think it should say, "Love Ross and Mona?"
Umm, I-I thought we were moving forward and now you're-you're sending me all these mixed signals. What are you trying to tell me?
Help!
Oh, thanks.
That is a tricky one. Well, Joey I really wanna thank you. You've, well you made a very difficult time for me a little less painful.
I'm sorry.
You guys have such a great place here.
Yeah. All right.
Wow! Well, welcome back!
Oh my God!
Mmmm!
I know, we did it!! Hey, that was incredible, huh?!
No, no, I should get home, I'm kinda tired.
You've seen all the movies...
Excuse me. Can, can I help you with something?
Could you pull open the curtains for me? The astronauts from the space shuttle are gonna be on the news, and since we don't have a TV, the lady across the alley said she'd push hers up to a window, so I could watch it.
Okay, so since umm, you're not going to jail tonight I was wondering if you would like to go to dinner with me?
And, of course, if you feel that neither of those is right for you, you can always adopt.
Uh-huh.
Cantaloupe juice.
Excuse me. You should check this out, tell the other tenants. Apparently he's running around looking for some kind of a hot girl.
No no no.
Whoa!
Oh my God, you are so paranoid!
'Cause the sweat's getting in my eyes and its burning.
I lose, now Jenga.
Hola, Joey!
Anyway, that's when me and my friends started this whole fruit basket business. We call ourselves 'The Three Basketeers.'
Good runnin' into you at the bank today, so ah, here's my number, 555-9323. Give me a call. Later.
Thank you very much.
Uhh, yeah.
This is the final boarding call for Flight 664 to Yemen.
Hey, how, how did you do that?
Uh-huh.
I'm a doctor.
Here she comes!
That's because they are.
You did a good thing today.
Ah. Fun conversation?
Is this guy great or what?
And anyhow, I'm sorry I was so harsh before, but you have to understand that I still look at Lizzie like she's a twelve-year-old girl.
All right you two, I'm gonna get going.
its Mike Hanagen.
Shoot! Shoot! Shoot!
Awwww!!
Rach! Come on! Rach!
Yeah, so we just thought we'd stop by and let you know there's still no pressure.
I have to be heading to my chateau, thank you.
My name in Mike, and I do play piano.
Last I heard, he was a pharmacist somewhere upstate.
I just came by to give you a kiss, I have to go pick up the baby, so. I'll see you later sweetheart, you too Chandler.
Which means you had seven years of beach fun and you can't put a price on that sweetie.
Whoops. Sorry. This just in. Oh, it's 9-1-1 from the restaurant, that means Monica needs me right away.
What?
Okay. And don't worry, I'm not just gonna take you out for donuts.
I've heard the speech: "if he knew it was gonna be the last time he saw her... "
Is it really your fa--I can't... well of course it is.
Oh great! Well, tell him thanks. And since uh, Joey seems like such a nice guy, maybe we could go on a date sometime?
It really was. There was this great little pastry shop right by my hotel. There you go, dear.
That's a good one!
Y'know, every year I say I'm gonna send out holiday cards and I never do it. Do you wanna, do you wanna send this one out together?
Well, what was supposed to happen?
What's going on Rach?
Are they, uh, firm?
There's a side of steamed vegetables.
Hey, that's weird, today's my birthday too!
Ah, it's not so much you, you were fat, you had your own problems. But you? What a bitch!
And it didn't feel so girlie during the Gulf War.
Ass and face.
She passed away.
You want me to cancel it?
C'mon, this is us.
I suppose mainly sexual.
In the park?
Sir! I'm afraid I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
Oh, come on, you're way out of my league. Everybody in here knows it. Bet that guy over there's probably saying, "ooh, why she out with him? He must be rich!" Well, I'm not!
Oh uh...I actually came here to ask you out.
Oh, I didn't, I didn't know that.
Aw come on Joey, it's easy. Y'know, it's hand, hand, head, head, up, pas de bouree, pas de bouree, big turn here, grand sissone, sissone, sissone, slide back, step, step, step, and jazz hands!
Oh, yeah. I know that.
Well then why don't we see the bride and the groom and the bridemaids.
Cleveland.
Hi!
Yeah, drop it! Drop the towel! Please drop the wowww.
Come on!
Hello everyone. So who am I saying hello too?
What?
Put some pants on kid so I can kick your butt.
Did you pick out the vowels?
I don't care. I am trying to get a person out of my body here, and you're not making it any easier.
"Spuds" is your grandmother?
Its Jake.
Honey I swear! I wasn't looking at her!
Okay, that's-that's not funny. Uhh.
Oh, really.
You are!
So it was really cool seeing you lecture today.
Welcome to the building. I'm uh, Steve Sarah; I'm president of the tenants committee.
I'm sorry, sorry. You're not supposed to say "long pause"
If you say yes then I'm serious, if you say no then I'm joking!
Hey!
Hi. Okay, will that be all?
No, I'm getting three separate heartbeats.
Gotcha.
Hi!
And your breasts! Hmm!!!
Remember, Emma, heart disease kills women too!
No we won't.
What?! What would make you think that?
Luisa Gianetti! Lincoln High? I sat behind you guys in home room!
Hi.
We've lost visual contact with the suspect.
I love you, love you.
Alright mister, let's see those panties.
Well, you're not gonna get one! Because in life there are no intermissions, people. Chapter 7: Divorce is a 4 letter word. How could he leave me?!?!
Yes! Yes! You did!
Doctor Ross Geller.
Uh, actually I find Marion's views far to progressionist.
No, no, I am, but only because for the last hour and a half I've been playing the movie Diner in my head.
Well, you have to understand how humiliating it was for me up on that altar in front of my entire family, all my friends.
I'm sorry, all our first class seats are taken. That couple got the last two.
Sooo!! Anyway...
It's really nice to see you again.
Hi!
Oh and your agent said you were okay with the nudity.
You are not going to regret this.
So, these will match the jacket you picked out for me last week?
Oh right, uhm, Don?
Oh no! But I just walked past three sales and I didn't go in. How strong am I?
Hey, waiter.
So we talked about the whole presentation yesterday at lunch and he wondered if one person would be enough to get a take on the trip and I said, "Yeah, absolutely!"
My boyfriend canceled on me. I mean.. I I finally find a real relationship. I mean, someone that I can spend this day with and then his wife comes back into town. I swear, its almost not worth dating married guys.
My best shoes, so good to me. I wear them everyday. Down at the heel, holes in the toes. Don't care what people say. My feet's best friends, pals to the end. With them I'm one hot chicky. Though late one night, not much light, I....
Would you like to spend the night in jail?
I've been following your career for years, I-I can't wait for your keynote speech.
Here we go!
No...
Actually yeah, that'll be great.
no that's just where you were going I just figured that I'd help you out, you don't seem like the kind of guy that does this very a lot.
Err... we know what we want.
Well of course not, but you were very good.
There are no hardware stores open past midnight in the Village.
Monica... Hey Mon, I have a question. Is Leroy the baddest man in the whole damn town or the fattest man in the whole damn town?
I'm sorry, I don't own a TV.
Oh, you're busy, that's ok, I'll get it. Anybody else want one?
I still can't believe they're tearing it down. It really is the most lovely building you'll ever see. I mean it's over... Oh my God!
When I'm in a relationship, I love having a girlfriend.
Oh no, stay here we'll keep doing this. I'll pay you.
No, that's cold, that's cold, that's...
Texas?
No.
Oh my God!!
Oh, Martha Ludwin's daughter is gonna call you. Mmm! What's that curry taste?
13.
Okay.
Nooo. Uh-huh, no way. What? No.
No.
We can't scratch. You know we can't, we'll scar.
Hang on a minute! Joey, you keep touching your face. Is something wrong?
I'm sorry, but I can't say.
Hey, pal, you have about three seconds to get away from my partner.
I think my uterus just skipped a beat.
All right, I got to run. Tell Monica I say goodbye. And... I'll see you later, neighbor.
What is it?
The Velveteen Rabbit. I kinda have the feeling you had something to do with it.
Uh sir, may I see your tickets please?
She what?!
Okay.
No-no, I heard what you said, funny. I like funny. This team is about hard work, but it's also about having fun. Good to have you aboard Bing!
Is that true miss?
I bet it's fast.
Yes?
That's it. That's my whole name.
I'm sorry, I can't tell the baby to wait for them.
Jarvis?
Well, I bet you are all thinkin' "Now would be a really great time for an intermission", huh?
But you're supposed to work on Monday.
I guess.
No me, I am so sorry...
All right.
I guess we just keep dancing.
Hey it's Mona! From the wedding.
Is he alright out there by himself?
He's getting married tomorrow right?
Ross and Emily have made their declarations and it gives me great pleasure to declare them husband and wife.
but you did say it.
Yeah, I just gotta run to the bathroom.
Right.
I am telling you, up until I was, like nine, I thought that gunpoint was an actual place where crimes happen.
May I help you?
So, she has a boyfriend. What is your situation?
Hope you had a nice flight.
Alright, Monica dear, I'm gonna hit the road. Now I've left my 10 verbs on the table. And you be sure and send me that finished poem.
It's never gonna happen again right?
The woman I love is having a baby today. I've been waiting for this just as much as you have.
You know, you read about it, you see it in the movies. Even when you practice it at home, man oh man, it is nothing like that.
So what? I mean if even I can get past that, it shouldn't bother you. And you don't have to like her. You just have to accept the fact that I do. I mean, if you even can't be civil to the woman I love...
No. No, haven't seen a monkey. Do you know anything about fixing radiators?
Well um, I was in ah Mrs. Knight's ah, I mean Alice, sorry, Alice, I always do that. I was in her ah, Home Ec class.
Oh my God. You listen to me, Chandler, you listen to me. One of these times is just gonna be your last chance with me.
Can I help you?
Uh, okay.
And then right, right when the scene ends, he could take her with this raw, animal....
I will if you will.
Yeah, he took the other one off and hit me with it.
Hello, Monica. Hello, greeter girl.
No way!
Yeah?
Oh, that is so not true.
Thanks! Enjoy your funeral.
Oh!
Oh, just years of experience.
Don't get me started. Anyway, umm, since there are three babies and umm, we both got to put our names in, we would be truly honoured if you named the other boy baby.
Well, the white seems to be untouched. Uh-oh.
Saw your head. Saw your head.
Oh, uh... we just uh... happen to wear the same shade.
Look, Rachel's told me how much easier you've made all this on her. Why can't you do that for me?
Why did you have to fill your father's head with all that garbage about making things right? Things were fine the way they were! There's chicken in there, put it away. For God's sake, Joey, really.
Bye.
C'mon people, back up please, back up, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon.
That would be great! Also, uh, I was hoping to catch a show so if you can make any suggestions...
Here Mitzi! Here Mitzi!
Y'know, they ruin it for everybody.
I, Emily...
Ohh.
Oh, I was going to offer you my apartment.
Bona sera.
And there is Kevin.
"Hi Joey, it's Jane Rogers can't wait for your party tonight"
I'm gonna take off now. You're gonna let me go home, aren't you?
God, you're gonna be here all night!
I missed you at work today. How are you feeling?
Great!
So, so, did you hear?
I uh, I got it from the gift shop. They have really lax security there. It's a joke.
Oh my God!!
Excuse me. Excuse me. Sweetheart! Come!
Seriously?
Yesss?
Now it also says here that you lied about your sexual preference before marriage?
The next baby should be along in a minute.
Meet me in the bathroom.
No don't worry, this is not some rebound thing. I am totally over Eric.
So wait, what's the deal here, I can have sex with you, but I can't touch you?
Us, what about you guys? Man you really, bing, gave it to old Mr. Clean back there. He was a big guy.
So that's your second marriage in two years.
No. But it's okay, I'll just put out pickles or something.
I-I-I gotta go, I gotta go. Okay, not without a kiss.
Ohh, well when you said all you were going to be doing between now and the time you leave is packing, you didn't really leave me much choice. Did you?
Hey.
I can promise not to tell her again.
I found the picture!
Oh my God, congratulations!
Goodbody!
No thanks.
What?
Okay, I've got some ugly friends, and they're all available too.
But you're not.
You're welcome.
I knew you'd understand.
Hey, what are you guys doing tomorrow night?
Oh my God, Phoebe.
You can forget about Emily, she's not with us.
Oh, somebody's been doing his buns of steel video.

What did I tell you about talking to your friends while you're working?
No... no...
You told on us?
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
Why don't we try massaging the breast to stimulate the flow.
And the cream?
What woman?!
So...? What do you think?
Why would we be freaked?
Ah, just one other thing.
Hey, hey Ross.
But my apartment is so...
Uhh, yeah, I think I'm going to take-off too.
Well okay!
Completely anonymous. From two kind strangers.
Oh, sure. I'm showing it to someone else right now, but please, look around.
No, it's a water balloon fight! We started it!
And when you have a second later, I wanna show you why we don't just trap spiders under coffee mugs and leave them there.
Did I, uh, did I miss something?
Oh, well we cut the trip short.
Oh yes, there you are.
Thank you.
Yeah! Welcome, it is Soap Opera week here on Pyramid, let's meet our contestants. First, Gene Lester is a database specialist, he's gonna be playing with "Days of Our Life's" star Joey Tribbiani!
Alright, let's take this outside.
Shoot! I can't go, I have to work!
Okay, what the hell, what the hell. You want me to actually throw you or you-you wanna just hop?
You're both gonna have to take this up with the judge.
Well, I'm very glad you're here.
Oh, there's our stop.
After you.
Yeah, and they-and they say that our-that our only chance to have a baby is that if they take my sperm, her egg and put it together in a dish and then put it into another girl. So we were wondering if you could be the girl that we could put it into.
She.
We're so sorry.
Now Mr. Kaplan Sr. likes his coffee strong, so your gonna use two bags instead of one, see. Now pay attention, 'cause this part's tricky, see some people use filters just once.
So Santa's coming?
Maybe I'll sign for it. Tear it open. Pull out the packing material...
Y'know I wanted to tell you yesterday, but I just, I kinda felt all floopy, and...
I took your advice, I left Myron.
Now, I want you to tell me what you're doing while you're doing it.
I love Mark. Do you know Mark?
Dr. Geller!
Hey! Me too!
What contracts?
Alright, I gotta report you. What's your medallion number?
I know.
Well, the-the three of us we were, kind of umm, a couple.
Don't worry about it, I just didn't realize you were married.
Oh, well, likewise. Actually, not likewise. I've never heard of you until this morning, but, it's nice to be nice!
There's one leaving in thirty minutes.
Not really. You...you're blurry, but you still look like Ursula. You're Blursula. Okay wait. Maybe...If I-if I just don't look at you for a while. See? It...it works. I'm not, I'm not angry at all anymore! This is a great date!
Sir, this is not a first class ticket. I'm sorry.
How exciting!
Night-night Bing-a-ling.
Game, point!
Thank you. All right.
Uh, your finger was covering the lens.
Oh, maybe that's it.
What?! I've never seen one before!
Yeah, sure.
No, I mean it. There are so few genuinely nice guys out there.
I'm in love with you.
So? Congratulations you two, I didn't even know you got married.
Yeah! Yeah, it was definitely an improvement. G'night.
You know, kinda think of it, the capital of Peru IS "vtox". Oh god! Oh!
But, we can't go now. It looks like Rachel's gonna put on a skit.
Thank you!
Is Tony Randall dead?
Oh wait! I almost forgot. We have to ask everybody this. Other than Days of Our Lives, what's your favorite soap opera?
Pass!
Oh, jeez.
You are falling fast asleep. Deeper. Deeper. Deeper. You are now completely asleep. You don't need to smoke. Cigarettes don't control you. You are a strong, confident woman, who does not need to smoke. A strong, confident woman.
All right, he's crowning. Here he comes.
Sure!
This is contestant number sixteen, Rebecca...
Oh sure. Vince?!
Do you realise that we have not seen each other since the night of that U2 concert?
I'm sorry sweetie, it's the hospital. The food looks great, maybe save me some?
And I'm with you! What a great time to be alive! Look at this plate-bouncy thing. What an inspired solution to man's plate dispensing problems.
I love you!
Hey!!
Me? I'm fine. Look, honey, in an ideal world, there'd be no her, and your father would look like Sting. And I'll tell you something else. Ever since that poodle-stuffer came along, he's been so ashamed of himself that he's been more attentive, he's been more loving... I mean, it's like every day's our anniversary.
That's not the hard part honey! The hard part is what comes next, I mean aren't you worried about the results?
Do you want to know?
Yes?
I'd rather not.
It's so nice to see you! Both of you! Look at me. Look how young I look! Oh gosh! We have so much to catch up on! But first things first: touch my abs I don't exercise at all! Oh gosh, so Monica, you're married!
Aaaahhhhhhh.
How could you know. Why wouldn't you punch me in the stomach?

Dr. Farber, Jason Greenstein's gagging.
No, I can't.
Hold on! You got her pregnant?
As my lawfully wedded wife, in sickness and in health, till death parts us.
No one's ever thrown me a surprise party before!
Yes. We're very popular. There's a two-year waiting list. Sorry!
This is a nice resume. Nice, nice, nice. Muy impressivo.
So uh, you wanna go to Marquel's?
Why don't I remember this dog?
Oh, here is your beautiful baby. Congratulations!
Sorry, I wa- I was just saying to my friend that I thought you were the most beautiful woman that I'd ever seen in my- in my life. And then he said that- you said you thought
Hey Danny.
Why not?
Hello everybody!
Phoebe what's wrong?
