Hi.
Oh that's nice.
Hi.
Yeah, yeah man don't do it. I mean if you date her, then-then-then I can't date her.
Well, if Phoebe's choosing, then say hello to Mike's next groomsman.
Yeah, I really do. Yeah, but what am I gonna do, I mean we-we both agreed that it was gonna be a two-week thing, y'know no commitment.
So...
Oh-oh, hitting me where it hurts, my ski skills.
Well, how about this year, instead of Santa, we have fun celebrating Hanukkah?
Uh-huh. Well, when the psychiatrist told me I had to take a leave of absence because I yelled at my boss I started to get worked up again, so he offered me a tranquilizer. And I thought was a good idea so, I took it.
Wait a minute, she was walking the bike? Both times?
No I left the diapers at the hospital! There's some in the bag but I'll run out and get some more.
So, uh, what kinda stuff do you think they'll have you do there?
Okay, where in the hell did you get that?!
You okay?
Well, I'm gonna go see her. I want to bring her something, what do you think she'll like?
Hey, I'm more cop than you two!
Well, well I am married. Even though I haven't spoken to my wife since the wedding.
No, Susans gonna be there too. Weve got dads, weve got lesbians, the whole parenting team.
Hi there!
I'm Ross, Phoebe's friend from the coffeehouse.
Y'know, you're right. Thank you.
It's the-Chandler!!
I saw you!
Ohh.
Yeah.
That's, that's pretty. Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What are you doing there Gert?
We know!
Yeah.
I'm sorry, I meant a blue LeSabre.
That guy, he burns me up.
Ohh.
Hey, is Rachel here? Um, I wanted to wish her a happy birthday before I left.
And you're afraid you won't be able to...fill his shoes.
Why- why- why would he need a blade?
Oh my God, he just said your name, that's great! Good job Ben.
Okay, let's go.
Oh yeah? Well, I'm rubber, you're glue, whatever can't do it. Listen, uh- gimme back my puck.
That, that is funny. That is painfully funny. No, wait. Wait, yeah, that's just painful
Look, this is a disaster! Can't I please just go?
Yes I would.
Yeah!
Well, then, I think, I think the guy is scum. I hate him. I mean I actuallyI-I physically hate him. I always have. You are way too good to be with a guy like that.
Hey, tell me again, what do I do when Mr. Roper calls?
Grab a spoon. Do you know how long it's been since I've grabbed a spoon? Do the words 'Billy, don't be a hero' mean anything to you?
Yeah. No. No you're right.
Ok, Phoebe, this is it. In this briefcase I carry actual scientific facts. A briefcase of facts, if you will. Some of these fossils are over 200 million years old.
And that's, that's funny why?
Hi Janine!
Those are the pacts!
Are you kidding? I have had some very dirty dreams about this...
Okay, quick and painful.
Yeah, it'll be like a funny Thanksgiving story!
Come here Oh! There she is! Hi!
Why don't we talk about this on the way to the hospital?
No!
Yay!
Okay, okay. If that is what it takes to show you how much you mean to me, and how much I want you there. Then that's what I'll do.
Wha... you're uh, you're, you're over me?
Oh yeah, I'd love that.
Emma left her stuffed t-rex at my house. You know she can't sleep without it.
Yeah, what, what was I thinking?
Well...
Did you just say "break up with Charlie"?
I thought, uh... it was a fifty cent limit.
Uh-huh! Uh-huh! And-and-and I'll always remember that summer because that's when I realized that we are related.
Cheers!
Hi!
or...
I guess so.
Umm say, I-I opened this earlier but let me give you guys some privacy.
Hey!
Hmm -you know, actually this'll work out well. Cause when you have to move back in with Joey, Joey's hot new roommate can come and live with me.
It's called the Bapstein-King comet, okay? Hey! Hey! Bapstein was a very well respected astronomer!
Oh yeah!
Oh oh, we think Emma is about to start talking so we're trying to be careful about what words we use in front of her.
Ahh. Ooh, is this a ah, is this a bad time?
Uh, I don't know, whatever.
Pepper?
Nobody likes change.
That's right, he's not Drake, he's Hans Remore, Drake's evil twin.
I can't get *enough* dinosaurs!
Hey?
No, you, ya know there's no need to make it u. . . how?
Pshhshhh!
Hey.
Amy, I ju... I just... I just wanna...
My fault?! You threatened the judge!
...will be two months...
Right, so that's a firm "no". I cannot believe this, I just keep striking out.
Well umm, y'know, I used to play.
Helen Geller? I don't think so.
Uh we-we need to talk.
That's a good point.
Well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title?
No!
Paolo. Hi.
Rachel, I can see you dialing! I don't understand why...
The one with the cat. I gotta go, I've got another date.
Wow, Monica's letting other people help decorate her tree! Did someone get her drunk again or?
Hmm? Oh, a student I don't know.
O-kay. Well, I'm gonna go grab us some breakfast.
Pheebs, what about you?
Chandler!
Nonono, thatthat's not what I was saying...
Oh, Liam. So uh, what, were you guys playing soccer or something-or should I call it football?
OK, fine, well I'm not gonna watch, alright.
Yeah, Joan Tedeski my date. She's an assistant professor in the Linguistics department. Tall, very beautiful, and despite what some people say, not broad backed!
Do you like it?
Yeah!! Yeah!
Rach, I told you, you can't call him every time any little thing comes up.
What? That's like insanely easy!
You've got to be kidding me!
She said you gave her the razor!
Hey.
What?
Ehh, I was just, I was just thinking about your father.
Y'know what? It sounds so weird to say this but, I just had a great day with Janice!
Rach, you can't look fat in an x-ray.
Wait a minute, I-I believe I'm entitled to use my Angel Pass for a free turn?
What?!
Well, where do I start? This is Julie. Julie, this is Rachel.
I mean-no, it's just 'cause, it's just 'cause you and I were like a nightmare. No, but there was some good times.
Oh that's not pretty.
What? You forgot fourteen states?
Okay. So uh, well, this-this is uh, this is awkward.
Dad?
Oh, is it? Is it? Look, when Monica and I were kids, we had a dog named Rover. And, uh, one day, my dad decides, he doesn't like dogs. So Monica and her friend...Phyllis...take away the dog. And that was the last time we ever saw him. Don't you see? This is just like that. Only with a few details changed.
I don't know. Phoebe, if one of us saw Mike with another woman would you want us to tell you?
Actually she's a paleontology doctoral candidate, specializing in the centazoic era.
That-that's always good news. Are you okay?
Oh, you-you sure? Okay. Okay. So what's uh, what's your name.
You okay?
You like it?
Look this is starting to look really bad for me. Okay? Mona, Mona's standing right over there. Oh God, she's talking to Joey! You gotta let me win!
Uh Joey, that's just the minumum amount due, that's your total due.
Hi.
You-you just said that you did!
Ohh, okay.
I won't date. I'll uh, I'll be here, with you, all the time.
Well we haven't offically asked them yet, but we would want Monica and Chandler.
Oh, no-no-no don't you worry about me falling asleep. I still have your letter!!!
I do not always have to be-okay, okay.
This-this is crazy! I can do this! All right, uhh, I bet I can get all 50 before dinner.
It wasn't so much a party as...a gathering of people, with food, and music, and, and the band.
We ran into him on the street today and he said he might have a job for her. But I know he just wants to get into her pants.
You were incredible! Brand new woman, ladies and gentlemen.
Okay, um... I don't want her watching our baby.
Okay, I'm scum, I'm scum.
Oh, I thought Joey was here. Five is good. Well, I'm gonna have a loogie in my coffee tomorrow.
This is fun. Hey Rach, remember that whole "We were on a break thing?" Well, I'm sorry, will you marry me?
Item J437-A, color: winterberry. Hi umm, listen come here, come in. I'm so-so sorry about yesterday. I-I'm really sorry. It's just that I...
Yeah, yes it is, I was just moistening the tip.
Shhh! We're not talking.
I know.
Hey, that guy did not hypnotise me! Okay.
I ... I was just talking about Rachel.
C'mon, you know everyone I've been with. All, both of them.
No, these are my pants.
You weren't trying to entice me with your nakedness.
Oh, okay, y'know what this is? This is a difference of opinion. And when that happens in a marriage...
What was wrong with Mona?
Okay, why are you here?
Okay, Joey, you know what? You have to go for it. How often does this happen to you, huh? You owe it to yourself.
Oh my god, crap from the street?
Monica. Whaddya think?
Can we please focus here, a naked man's life hangs in the balance!
I don't even know what that's for.
Save the breakthroughs for therapy, okay. The clock is ticking. We have no time, and we are losing, we are losing to girls.
No! No! Look-Hey, enough is enough! Look, I am sorry that you feel guilty or whatever about spending time with your new mom, but this is not your old mom. This is a cat! Okay, Julio the cat! Not mom! Cat!
I'm just so happy you guys are finally getting a kid.
Hey, it'll grow back, right? And she-she's really fun, and she's cool, and-and I'm finally moving on. Y'know? I mean getting over Rachel was so , y'know? Y'know, and I'm finally feeling sane again. And now if I go up there, and-and I kiss her, and, Gooood I wanna kiss her, and-and-and it doesn't work out, right? Do I really wanna put myself through that again?
Oh yeah, Emily convinced me to do it.
Okay! Okay! That's it!! Parents!! Parents!! Back away!! All right, this is our wedding day! From now on everyone gets along, and if I hear one more word. NO GRANDCHILDREN! That's right!!
That depends, how much did you hear?
OK, I need to lie down.
Uhh, okay, it's uh, Emily and I, we decided to uh, to get married.
You guys, you know what, you know what, it doesn't matter, because you both have to go get dressed before the big vain in my head pops. So..
Okay, we'll be right in. So ah, did your boss try to slap you again today?
Just stuff. Y'know kinda what Emily wants.
Okay, the other night I was leaving the museum just as 'Laser Floyd' was letting out of the planetarium, without even trying I sold 50 boxes! That's when it occurred to me, the key to my success, 'The Munchies.' So I ah, started hitting the new dorms around midnight. I am selling cookies by the case. They call me 'Cookie Dude!'
Oh sure.
Looks like a fun gang.
Dude, I was gonna ask her out.
Quack, quack..
Really, it would be good for you and in fact, why don't you, why don't you go ahead to the restaurant and I will wait for my mom and then I'll meet you there.
Animal sex, animal sex? So what're you saying, I mean, you're saying that like, there's nothing between us animal at all. I mean there's not even like, uhm, a little animal, not even, not even like, like chipmunk sex?
Yeah, hi, I was just beeped. No, Andr is not here. Third time today. Yes, I'm sure... No, sir. I don't perform those kind of services.
It's worth the pain. Y'know what, you know what? It's not.
Oh, well, uh, this is gonna sound kinda silly, but, do you remember my roommate Chandler Bing?
You tell them to wait!
Correct. Her actual favorite movie is...
Yeah, kinda. It's this woman from work. I hope that won't be too weird. Will it, Rach?
Huh? Ooh you mean like a... Huh?
What?! Why?
Rach!
Okay, I didn't know you would say that.
Yeah, that's okay, I mean if you guys all have to go away for the first weekend I'm alone by myself, y'know then I totally, totally understand.
15? Your personal best!
Okay.
Then, uh, then we got dressed, and I-I... I walked her to the- -the bus stop... I'm fine.
You're welcome.
Oh really, really great! Yeah! A-actually she's right down the street, umm, do-do you know what? You should stop bye and say hi.
The doctor says it's completely normal with all the hormones. Plus, you-you're sleep deprived.
Sure, one year is paper, but two months is lapdance!
Yeah, y'know the ah, the girlfriend I told you about last night? Well it turns out she ah, she wants to get back together with me. Oh, I found it!!
I know, it's the first time, we're leaving the baby and ... hey, I know how hard it is for you, but ... but Emma is gonna be fine. My mom is gonna be with her. She's great with kids.
Here goes...
Still... this is amazing... Oh my god, thank you, Phoebe.
Uh, uh, well you're, umm, you're my lobster.
She, she was different.
Alright, let's go!
Yeah? I was good at the stuff huh?
Well thanks!
He's right, even if it's to say something complementary.
Oh. What's wrong with Ross?
Halftime.
Hey Joey! Great stuff huh?
Uh...Mona just dumped me.
Rachel! Well, you-you're not at home, you're-you're-you're right here.
Okay, the thing is..
Wha, heh, how could you know, I don't even know!
What do you think you're doing?!
Ugh, she's saying good-bye to her uncle.
Hey Rach, can I talk to you outside for a second?
Oh my God!
Oh, god. You know, this is still pretty hot.
I didn't get the annulment.
I know-
Look, I'm not being any of those things, ok, I'm just being realistic.
What? What? What? What is it?
Sorry! Sorry! Oh, there! Hey Gary, who am I? Phone home!
Uh, Joe, have you looked outside?
I whitened them.
Eh? We'll show him!
It's the off light. Right Ross?
No, I-I'm not doody.
You are? Me, too!
Oh-oh really?
Well you sure used a large font.
You know what, I think we've had all the bad luck we're going to have.
I do.
Let's do the card!
Look, I didn't lose my mind! Okay, Janice and I have a lot in common! We've-we've both been divorced. We-we both have kids.
Uh-ha, what about someone who looks like Rachel? I will think about the therapy.
Well, fine. Fine! If-if I'm the only person with any appreciation of the sanctity of the written word, I'll go up there and defend it myself! And don't you follow me!
Emily?!
Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket.
Dad, before I was born, did you freak out at all?
Doesn't sound as crazy as paying a thousand dollars for a cat.
Uh Joey, can you give us just a minute?
You don't have a valid driver's license-Okay that is it! Pull over right now!
Nono, that would be me again.
Hello? No she can't come to the phone right now. Oh, right no problem. Okay, bye-bye.
Yeah! Good for you Joe!
DANGER!!!!
Okay, come on! All right, I gotta go! So good luck at the party. Okay?
Hey. We-we look...we look pretty good.
Y'know what? Maybe, Mrs. Green, it's not absolutely vital that you live with us.
Yes, of course they like you!
Professor Neuman, the head of the department, so....
Posting that I died? That really isn't funny.
We're not alone.
Look I'm sorry Pheebs, I can't do it.
So I told Carl, 'Nobody, no matter how famous their parents are, nobody is allowed to climb on the dinosaur.' But of course this went in one ear and out.....
We said it was only going to be two weeks, y'know?
Hey!
Uh.. uh.. Well, Joey and I had discussed getting in an early morning racquetball game. But, um, apparently, somebody overslept.
I've no idea, could be. Listen, I'm sorry I had to work tonight.
Yeah, they all know.
That, for all I knew would, could last forever. That to me is a break-up.
Oh-oh-ooh, hey guys, I was wondering if you guys would uh, maybe chip in on some new air filters for the air purifier? I mean after all, we all are using it.
Hey, I brought the camera for Emma's video.
Monica, if you want, I can lend you some money.
She looks so small.
No! Okay! Okay! Okay, look, can I, can I just-just talk to you for a second?
Oh, that's great, that is great!
Chandler? Chandler?
Is there blood coming out of my ears?
Ohh! That would be great.
Why should Ben step aside? It was his audition in the first place! You-you just tagged along! You're like the uh, tag-a-long dad.
What's goin' on?
It's okay, I'm ready.
Is this?!
Or you can sit with him on the front porch and make sure no one steals the trash cans. He does that every week too.
What's that supposed to mean?
No, no, let me finish.
Yeah. You, uh, you want some?
OK. OK, this is a picture frame from Ben to my parents, huh.
Oh man, I can't believe you guys are leaving this place.
Well, these. These are yours right here.
All right, you know that one was coming, but that doesn't mean you have unagi.
Sorry I ah, I scared you in there.
FOOTBALL!
You complete me kitchen, matey!
Hi.
When we first met her, she was soaking, her feet were wet! Who wouldn't be miserable? I'm telling you when I got her into a dry pair of shoes, she was a totally different person.
Oh, I've got to go pick up Ben, we've got a play date this afternoon.
30 seconds on the clock. 5 questions wins the game. The lightning round begins...now! What is Joey's favorite food?
Y'know what...
Aw-oh, that's right. Are-are you gonna be okay?
Because, I'm finally getting him excited about Hanukkah, and, and you're-you're wrecking it.
No. No. Nothing happened. I shut the drapes to uh, show her slides of my favorite fossils.
Look, you were right. She looks at me and sees a friend, that's all. But then I met Julie, and I don't know, we're havin' a great time. And I have to say, I never would've gone for it with her if it hadn't been for you.
Hey.
Ooh, I wanna switch to Rachel too!
Once Monica was sent to her room without dinner, so she ate the macaroni off a jewelry box she'd made.
Here she comes. Don't say a word, okay? Just be cool, don't be...y'know you.
It's me. Ron. Look, I um, I now Rachel turned you down but I think there is a way you might be able to get her to come back.
Yeah well, if ah, if that's the rule this weekend... No!
You know what, this is ridiculous, ok. This is your birthday, this is your party. I say we just put 'em all together and if they can't deal with it, who cares.
Look at that, look at that, see how she's pushing him away and he won't budge. Alright, I'm gonna do something. Excuse me, are you Rachel?
Yeah, I uh, totally forgot about that. You mind if I take a rain check? I'm waiting for a call from Emily.
Okay. Cool.
Over my dead body!
This is a girl that I really like and had too swoop in there!
Sure, because women never like Joey. Y'know, I think he's a virgin.
I Know!
Nothing, nothing. Lee-lo, the laundry's done.
Whazzup??
Emily, there is nothing between Rachel and me. Okay? I love you.
Hey everybody!
What dog? There-there's no dog here.
Oh, I'm sorry you've been Bamboozled! You're gonna be a terrible mother! I've lost sight of why we're doing this!
I don't know if it's true.
Oh.
I... just feel that the... the chemistry isn't right. I'm sorry. We're... we're more than happy to give you good recommendation...
Burt!
Okay. Yeah, I guess, I guess I could do that too.
Thank you.
What?
Hey! I offered to marry her!
Yeah! Right!
Thank you, but, but you, you gotta leave.
No no no, I mean, hey, why shouldn't I be happy for you? What would it say about me if I couldn't revel in your joy? I'm revelling baby, believe me!
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la! Okay, okay, yeah, I would have been devastated but, I would still want to be with you. Because it's, I mean it's you.
Ahh, whoo-hoo!!
Yeah.
Hey everybody, Pheebs is here!
Basically, Rachel and I were in Vegas and we got drunk...
Oh, I hope they're not ruined.
Cannot feel my tounge.
Oh.
Yeah.
It's...it's complicated okay?
Do you have a minute? I'd like to talk to you about something I'm, I'm really uncomfortable talking about.
Did you see me write one down?
I-I heard about Mrs. Verhoeven passing away and I'm so sorry for your loss.
I have been working out.
I think we proved our point.
Marcel is an illegal exotic animal. I'm not allowed to have him in the city. If they find him, they'll take him away from me.
Monica bang! Monica bang! Ow!
Are you sure? Because I can stay out as late as you want. I told you how I'm on sabbatical from work, right?
Well, ya know, they're a little behind the times in Colonial Williamsburg.
Look, Mon, do you want us to uh, come back later?
Hi... There she is. Hi Emma. Oh my God, I missed you. Oh Emma, I missed you so much. Hey... Did you have a good time with grandma Green? Huh? Did she give you a bottle of anti-depressants again to use as a rattle?
As my lawfully wedded wife, in sickness and in health, until death parts us. Really, I do. Emily.
Wha-What did he say that was so funny?
Yeah! Yeah! Oh, this will make a great memory.
The Geller Cup.
Or Joseph.
Wait, did you get to the part about his 'huge throbbing pens'? Tell ya, you don't wanna be around when he starts writing with those!
I'm telling you, I like the food!
Oh what's the big deal?! I wasn't even invited to the ceremony, just the reception. And-and y'know what? If it makes you feel any better, Joan and I will just make an appearance and then, and then we'll-we'll leave early as a sign of protest.
A what?
Oh, thank you so much!
Yep.
Okay. Uh, Ross and Rachel. Rachel and Ross. That's been one heck of a see-saw hasn't it?
You still on that?
Will you hold Ben for a sec? Come here. Come here.
Still-still, let me come... for me.
No really, you tell me what's up.
Peach pit.
Hey you guys I got some bad news.
Yeah see? And you are so excited about moving in together before, and you know what? You should be. It's a big deal!
You mean that?
I am so sorry.
Yeah, tell me about it.
You got the clothes clean. Now that's the important part.
What?
I'm good.
I don't even wanna hear it, you're just...
Hmm...
No! Nonono, wait a sec. I may have something in the back.
Great! Because Emily and I are getting married in a month!
Amazing!
I hope you cleaned your hair out of the drain.
Yeah, why?
Ok, ok, here we go. Ok, where am I talking to, here? I mean, uh, well, there is one way that seems to offer a certain acoustical advantage, but...
Oh. Hey, who's Carl?
Rachel, ready or not, here comes your knight in shining. . . oh no.
I'm an eight!
Okay, okay, I'm sorry, it will never happen... Uh-oh! Wait a minute! Wait-wait, now there are a hundred of you and I'm the king.
Yeah! Se vice?
What?!
Hey!
Here you go.
What's that on the bottom?
It really was.
Ranion's theory of species variegation?
Oh no-no, after you. Oh my God!
Anyone want me to appraise anything?
Rachel?
Okay.
Hey, if they have a ball maybe you can stick razor blades in it and teach them a new game, Gonna Need Stitches Ball.
Yes!
Hey, 30 is not that old! Do you know how old the Earth is?
Yeah, not since I got too strong for you.
Then be supportive like a guy.
Yeah, it's hard okay, I only have two spots left.
Because you sent away the dog!
No that's not what I want. Uh, I'm glad you guys were bonding but I...
Shhhh!
Are you serious?!
Wow! That is a good one! Wow, it looks like a, like a holiday card y'know, with the tree in the middle and the skaters and the snow.
Yep! I'd like to thank you guys for coming down here to complain about the rain and ruin my career!
Sweetie, you gotta relax. Everything's gonna be great, okay? Come on. Come on.
Ok. Let's see. Oh, you should take her to the MET!
Yeah, that'll do it.
What is Monica's biggest pet peeve?
Just go for it Chandler.
No no, this big pile of dishes in my mom's breakfront. Do you guys know who Carl is?
You're wearing the same shirt.
What, you didn't get it? The doctor is a monkey.
Who's laughing now?
Joey!
You don't-you don't want to hear about my dream Officer...Pretty?
Oh really! Why is that?
Oooohhh, I'll bet she's one of those people.
Here. At least I made ten bucks in my relationship.
Then don't. Stay here. Just don't go so soon to London, just one more day.
Hey.
That's funny, that, no, because, uh, our parents actually did, uh, send our dog off to live on a farm.
Not that big a deal? It's amazing. Ok, you just reach in there, there's one little maneuver, and bam, a bra right out the sleeve. All right, as far as I'm concerned, there is nothing a guy can do that even comes close. Am I right?
Yeah. Yeah, I think I will.
Well, that's cool. So did...
Sure, we don't live there but...
Y'know, here's the thing. Even if I could get it together enough to- to ask a woman out,... who am I gonna ask?
Playpen?! Ben's seven!
Flip me for it? No, no, no... heads, heads, heads!
All right Emily, as much as I love you, I'm sorry, I can't move to London without Ben.
I want you to tell her everything. About the deal you tried to make with me, about the crazy questions you... Wally Cox! That's the voice of Underdog!
It's not a library...
uhu uhu, check this out.
Hi!
OK, you guys, ya know, I think we've seen enough, let's turn it off.
I made fun of his accent.
That only took me an hour.
I really do.
No, no, I was turnin' the knob and, and. . . here it is.
Ezel? Ezel? Ezel?
What?
Okay, I've got three of my five.
Oh my God! Our daughter's a genius! Rach, this means...
Wow. Umm... Huh... I'm-I'm not sure what to do with that right now.
Hey, you guys.
How did you know she would buy scotch tape?
Ok.
Yeah.
Hey, you're right.
It's not something you are! It's something you have!
Let me hold him for a sec. There. Huh? There we are.
No-no-no, that's great! I'll be there Monday. And thank you again! Okay. Umm, that was the head of the Paleontology department at N uh, Y, uh U!
Yeah.
What's going on?
Pa-haa!! I would love to go with you.
Hum...So...hum...Oh hey I noticed you were reading the paper...another flood in Europe? Here's a question: "Would you...would you rather drown or be burnt alive?"
Nice to meet you.
I think Chandler's gone.
Okay. Okay. If uh, if you're gonna do this, then I'm gonna do that. So...
And his first name.
Boy, we uhm... hadn't really thought of that.
Hop in. Get ready for the smoothest ride of your life.
Hey, y'know what's weird? After you guys get married, when you introduce me to people you're gonna have to say, "This is my brother-in-law Ross." Not, "My friend Ross," "brother-in-law Ross." That's weird isn't it?
Hey!
Good luck!
Oh absolutely! It has been in my family for generations, and every bride who has worn it has had a long and happy life.
Well, you can help me!
C'mon, this was a pact! This was your pact!
Still, I can't believe that's sprayed on... I mean, it looks really good. I wonder if I should get one!
Come on. All right, here we go. All right?
Well, that just leaves the big Green poker machine, who owes fifteen...
Okay, remember, we were young. Hey, Spring break, sophomore year, I got high in my bedroom and my parents walked in and smelled it and so I told them that you had gotten stoned and jumped out the window.
Anyway it-it kinda-it all boils down to this, the last time I talked to Emily...
Hey, here's a thought.
Uhm, well... I'm here to see if you'll give Rachel her job back.
Thanks, man, big help.
Yeah! I don't know. I mean, last year Elizabeth now-now this kid. What-what-what-what is it?! Am I giving out some kind of...sexy professor vibe?
I am not doing this over the phone.
Well, uh, uh, I don't know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with the baby's name?
Nice to see you again Dr. Green.
Hmmmm....
Okay, Monica. Mon, uh what-what you just saw...
You were my first kiss with Rachel?
Maybe it's uh Sergeant Sagittarius coming back to flirt some more!
I can't believe you let George Michael slap you.
Yep, and you know what other holiday is coming up?
Well maybe, you know, maybe we should stay for one song.
Look Emily, I'm just having dinner with my friends, okay?
Well, I mean if uh, if Emily gave me a choice...
Oh, no-no-no, see, that-that clock's a little fast, uh, we have 17 minutes. Huh, what can we do in 17 minutes? Twice?
Yeah!
Professor Sherman, yeah. I've a meeting with him today.
Oh! So-so seriously, what time?
All right.
No, wait ! You guys, no, no, you can't leave! Rachel already feels bad that the cake's messed up. How do you think she's gonna feel when she comes back here and all you guys are gone?
Yeah, why would it be weird? Hey, Joey, can I get some coffee?
I'm having... I'm having a baby. I'm having a... Where's the phone? The phone?
There's my boy! Here's my boy! And here's his Barbi What's ah, what's my boy doing with a Barbi?
Hey, y'know what? This is your fault! You're the one that didn't move his-his appointment.
Chandler! Chandler!
All right, y'know what? If you are not going to learn how to ride this bike then I'm sorry, I'm just gonna have to take it back.
Ahhhh!!
People need juice!
See but, Pheebs that-that is the exact opposite intent of my music. Y'know my music is-is meant to inspire, and if it bothers you this much, then I... I won't play anymore.
I don't know. I mean I have plenty of opportunity. Just just now there were some women at the coffee house smiled at me.And then the other day on the subway a woman "accidentally" sat on my hand.
She's your cousin. She's your cousin! If she knew what was going on in your head she'd think you were sick! Or would she? Let's back up a second. She was the one who suggested opening a bottle of wine. She was the one who turned down the lights. She was the one that wanted to rent Logan's Run, the sexiest movie ever. Oh, I know that look. Forget it. I want it. She wants it. I'm going in.
Well, umm, why don't you give him a call?
Yeah, I really do. Yeah, but what am I gonna do, I mean we-we both agreed that it was gonna be a two-week thing, y'know no commitment.
No, not you.
Of course he is! What, do you think I'd just use my son as-as an excuse? What kind of father do you think I am?
What? I don't get a goodbye?
You talked to her?
You have no idea what a nightmare this has been. This is so hard.
Phoebe!
What, to blind my child?
Yeah, but-but he didn't know that!
Well, I thought so too, but then she said she'd marry you.
Hey!
Oh, I'm actually on my way to tell her right now. Yeah, she's been away all week visiting her parents, but she'll be cool. I mean, she's been so supportive. She-she even got the baby a tiny T-shirt that says, 'Fossils are my friends.'
God, do you realize in ten years we're gonna be 40?
Yeah.
Yeah? Well, I-I think Ben's asleep.
Dude, what'd you have?
Yeah.
Judy, Judy, relax, this is our little harmonica we're talking about. We taught her well. Ten percent of your paycheck, where does it go?
Oh.
Excellent!
Joey! The vet said it's a simple procedure.
Move in with me.
Seriously that's a lot of cups.
What, Rach?
I just wanna say good-bye to you guys and to see if you guys will place a little bet for me, huh? Twenty bucks on black 15.
I broke my thumb.
How do you know? You don't have a watch.
Anyway, suddenly I'm down field, and I realise that I'm the one who's supposed to catch him, right? Only I know there is no way I'm gonna get there in time, so I am running, and running, and that, that is when I woke up. See I, I am so not ready to be a father.
On account of my rage.
Okay, I...
Yes it is. See.
Challenge excepted.
I want my turkey now!
What, what do you mean, what? Is he gay?
What?!!!
I didn't get a cat.
Thanks.
No, I stayed at Julie's last night.
We are never gonna find him! He's one guy in a huge city!
Barbados.
Well, technically it seven billion years ago...
...now remember you have to imagine me in a kilt.
I think I might know what this is about.
Yep!
Woooo!!!
Well... I like how you look, what are you?
Sid you lucky deaf bastard.
Okay, and oh I'm gonna need a bunch of extra keys. Apparently I give them away for no reason at all.
Sure! Ooh-ooh, what about this?
From you? Yes, please!
Hello, it's us, all right? It'll be fine.
Oh, sure! I'm sure.
It's not like we don't know how to party!!
That said it was my sandwich?!
Fine.
Hey! Wha-hoo! What's this? Well it's a, it's a bottle of champagne. Why is this here?
My doctoral dissertation is in the library at school, I went to see it, and there were students makin' babies right in the middle of the Paleontology section!
Y'know this ??? is incredible.
Ohh, it's Joey! I love Joey!
So I finally heard back from Aunt Sheryl and apparently it wasn't a mistake. Ahh, there's-there's limited seating in the hall.
I had a problem.
Get away!
Yeah well, if I know Mark, and I think I do, I'd expect nothing less.
Hey. What was that all about?
Yep! That's my thing...
Yeah, okay you're right.
Good, good. Yeah coz the more I thought about it, the more I realised I don't think marriage is neccessarily the right path for you.
No-no it's not. What-what happened there Ned?
Actually, it wasn't that close.
Ohh, Geller's got one hooked! Ohh! Looks like a big one! Yeah, ohh! Ohh! It's the classic struggle between man and- Someone knocked over a lamp.
I Ross...
Well, I was going to, but after I talked to you, I talked to Joey.
Hey!
These aren't suede. Charlie: Excuse me, I'm looking for someone. You don't, by any chance, know a Ross Geller?
What about the time I said we were on a break?
Um.... no. See, I might've had feelings for her at one timenot any more. I justI...
Okay! Fine! Fine! If-if this is what you think, forget about the whole three divorce thing! Okay, I-I'll go to my lawyer's office right now and get this marriage annulled! Okay?! Because she means nothing to me! Noth--Nothing!!
I'll do it!
Oh, you like it? You wanna know where I got it?
What? What?!
Is everything okay?
Morning.
Bye.
Well, yeah, of-of course I'm okay! What? I'm just being supportive. Supportive of you and this whole trip, and-and what-what is uh, what's this?
Yeah, it's the Ultimate Fighting Combo. Yeah, I saved thirty cents, plus I get to keep the cup. Yay!!
Hey!
Wow!
I'll get it! I will get that!
Okay, that's a fire. Oh yeah. Oh yeah.
You do appear right on the cusp of something. Come on man, I'm sure he'll lose interest in a week or two, but for now can you please just do this for me?
Oh.
She may have died.
Well...
Okay, flight 421 to Paris. I don't see it, do you see it?
Okay! Do you wanna tell the story?!
Sure! Here.
I can't believe it! He's looking right at us!
You've got to help me my monkey swallowed a 'K'!
It's still looks pretty far!
It's an honor to meet you. I can't tell you how long I've been an admirer of your work, I mean, that Nobel prize, whoooo! I mean, I have to tell you that, you're one of the reasons I got into the field.
You do?
I think, sub-consciously...
Hmm, a lot of this stuff is from Colonial times. Hey, what are some other time periods Rachel?
I mean, I don't feel like I even have a girlfriend anymore.
Split it?
Okay, I'm the baby.
Come on, seriously.
Not only did we go out, we did it 298 times!
There you go! Good enough for your party, huh?
Are you gay?
Well, I guess I'm gonna call the beer company and try to find out where he is.
No, you let me fini...
Forget it.
You damn kids! You ring my bell one more time, I swear to... Ohh, uh Jill. Umm, that-that's just a little game I play with the kids down the hall. Umm, they've really taken a liking to me. Uhh what's-what's-what's the matter?
Okay. I think it's time to change somebody's nicotine patch.
Okay here we are Paul, Elizabeth. So I hope you guys were finding something to talk about.
No. No, y'know you don't, you don't wear enough of this. What?
I like it. I do, I think it's a Ten.
He is so weird.
So, we're off.
Look, forget it Phoebe. Okay? It's Rachel's tape and she can do whatever she wants with it. And she wants to destroy it. So, end of story.
Yeah.
You're looking!
So what're you saying here? I should shave again, pick up some wine, what?
Hey!
Do you feel better?
Umm, she kissed me.
Not just a key, I gave her the only key! I am now a homeless person in a very serious relationship.
You'd wait?
No, it turns out that the one from uptown was making a joke. But it was a different joke than I thought-it wasn't that funny. So I'm still torn.
Fascinating.
Is that funny? Am I supposed to be laughing?
Then what did happen?
Ahem... I want.... OK, I want to... feel your... hot, soft skin with my lips.
Oh, I thought it was just a kid yelling, "I'm gay! I'm gay!" Can I bring her in?
Not on you! On the stripper!
Mom no, come on! Thank you.
G'night.
Mon.
I honestly don't know if I'm hungry or horny.
C'mon! This looks good!
Listen, I'm ah, I'm sorry I've been so crazy and jealous and, it's just that I like you a lot, so...
Jasmine?
So, uh, why did you have to turn it down?
What's goin' on?
No!
Hero, I uh, I don't know-well, all right.
No way!
Y'know, we work in a museum of natural history, and yet there is something unnatural about the way we eat lunch. Now, I look around this cafeteria, and y'know what I see, I see-I see division. Division, between people in white coats and people in blue blazers, and I ask myself, "My God why?!" Now, I say we shed these-these coats that separate us, and we get to know the people underneath. I'm Ross! I'm divorced, and I have a kid!
Come on! All the cool kids are eating 'em!
Eww! No!! Her ear! All right, Monica categorizes her towels. How many categories are there?
Did the TV wake you?
Uh, Macy's, third floor, home furnishings.
What?! What do you mean? You-you-you're not pregnant?
Well, then that guy is in serious, serious trouble.
Y'know what?! It doesn't matter! It doesn't matter what you believe! What matters is what happened!
It was hard... I remember... I was in my bedroom... playing with my dinosaurs... playing and learning... and my father walks in and says... he says... "What are you doing with those things? What's wrong with you, why aren't you... why aren't you outside playing like a... like a real boy?
It gives it a nice antiquey look.
Damnit! I'll put a candle on the cake.
I knew it! I knew it! I always knew she liked him! Y'know, she'd say no, but here we are! Right? We just broke up, first thing she does!
Yeah! They're putting together this panel to talk about these fossils they just found in Peru and The Discovery Channel's gonna film it!
That is precious! Listen! I need Rachel's flight information.
Marcel, c'mere, c'mere. Well buddy, this is it. There's just a coupla things I want to say. I'm really gonna miss you, and I'm never gonna forget about you. You've been more than just a pet to me, you've been more like a be- Okay, Marcel, please, could you leave my leg alone? Could you just stop humping me for two seconds?! Marcel, would- okay, just take him away. Just take him.
What? Of course I did! You uh, you sat next to Sleepy Sleeperson.
My God!
Oh! You are gonna love it! and I'm so glad, we're finally doing this.
Hi! I'm so glad you're here, but it's gonna be a while. I-I wished you'd called first.
Yeah.
Alright you kids, bye now.
Dude, what am I gonna...
Ok.
Yeah!
Please start drinking!
You got it.
Ah, actually, I'm sorry we-we probably should get going.
Who the hell was that?!
Nothing, ah there was this thing at the museum. Come on. Easy.
Yeah.
I want to go to the bathroom.
No!
Oh, you uh, you wanna hear a freaky coincidence? Guess who's doing laundry there too?
Stop it!
Don't say that.
The point is I... I don't need this right now, OK. It, it's too late, I'm with somebody else, I'm happy. This ship has sailed.
What time?
Hey, do you have any gum?
I know, I know I really like you too. But we-we can't date. It's against the rules. It's forbidden.
That's cool.
Hey!
It was no big deal. We-we...said that the rumor was...that umm...you had both...male and female reproductive parts.
But hey, it's not just me, I mean the scientists and the tour guides never sit together.
Yeah, a real pleasure.
HEY, SHE'S FAST!! OKAY?!! Oh! You-you think you can be beat me? Let's go! Outside!!
In-in three minutes.
Okay, okay, I'll tell 'em it wasn't Chandler who got high. Now who should I say it was?
So uhh, you ready?
That was different!
Hi!
How come it's always us left in the field holding the ball?
Mmm?
Bye, Nana.
That is correct.
So how'd it go?
Nuh, uh, the moment's gone.
No.
Yeah but, you know, now that I think about it, I don't think I've ever seen Fun Bobby without a... a drink in his hand.
Okay, okay, see... that... that is the problem. He is too sensitive.
I didn't get the annulment.
You did it, man.
Me? No.
I... ahem... I really don't think so.
A loser you did it with 298 times!
Man! They cannot get enough!
I do too! I do too!
Huh, didn't see that coming.
Ok. No, hey, whoa, whoa, I'll get your coat.
Yeah-no, just that last song.
Sure.
Oh my god.
Oh! That's nice.
So, uh, how's she doing?
Hi.
That's the day you're gonna die? See-darnit, I've got shuffleboard that day.
It's a day to be thankful.
Ohh! Thank you! I like mail.
Did you get like a fresh batch of pregnancy hormones today?!
FINE BY ME!!
Wow, well uh, uh, actually, Julie's downstairs getting a cab, I just need the cat toy, did Monica say. . . What? Why, why are you looking at me like that?
A Play-Dough Barber Shop?
Yeah, that's the one. Listen, I don't want to hurt her.
No?
Come on.
I'm trying.
Oh, well, I, I guess it musta been the day after you were born. We were in the hospital room, your mother was asleep, and they brought you in and gave you to me. You were this ugly little red thing, and all of a sudden you grabbed my finger with your whole fist. And you squeezed it, so tight. And that's when I knew.
...I'm telling you it's totally unconstituional.
Hey, what are you doing shopping at eight in the morning?
Did you tell your sister to ask me out?
So, what? That's it?
What?
Well, you just...
That's, that's Julie. Ju... Julie, Julie. Hi Julie.
Whoa-whoa-whoa, Knicks season opener tonight. I thought maybe you guys would come over and watch it.
No wait, okay, okay, I have an idea. I want you to get on the swing, okay? And you'll see that there's nothing to be afraid of.
So you two are..?
Really like those Macadamia nuts, huh?
Oh, oh Chandler...
Mom, y'know what? I-I can't deal with this right now. I'm sorry...
I uhm... Well, I sang... well actually I rapped... Baby Got Back...
Well, of course you can defend yourself from an attack you know is coming, that's not enough. Look, I studying kara-tay for a long time, and there's a concept you should really be familiar with. It's what the Japanese call unagi.
Yes, it's a deadly but beautiful sport.
Hey!
I... I do, I do not love Rachel. I'm gonna tell her right now about the whole thing so we can get this marriage annulled as fast as possible. Okay? Would I do that if I loved her?
Hey, y'know what nickname never caught on? The Ross-A-Tron!
Yeah, no, you're right, I know, you're right, I'm not, I'm not gonna do it. All right, thanks guys.
Pheebs come on! I mean, consider the source! Of course her ex-husband's gonna say that stuff. Now, if you'll excuse me...
Come on, you-you can't tell me you actually believe that-that there's a woman inside that cat!
Marcel, Marcel, give Rossie the remote. Marcel. Marcel, you give Rossie the remote right now... Marce... you give Rossie the remote...
You got ink on your lip.
Whoa! You had sex today?
Oh! like what?! Oh I'm sorry, I don't mean to pry... it's just that this must be what regular people experience when they watch "Access Hollywood".
I'll help you. Yeah, I'll make up a schedule and make sure you stick to it. And plus, it'll give me something to do.
Phoebe, she doesn't know that you sneak out every night, she doesn't know that you sneak back every morning, and she doesn't know that you've been living with your Grandmother's for a week now.
I don't know what to do. What am I gonna do? I mean, this, this is like a complete nightmare.
I tell you one thing, I wouldn't mind having a piece of this sun-dried tomato business. Five years ago, if somebody had said to me, here's a tomato that looks like a prune, I'd say "get out of my office!"
Believe me, I've been dreaming about me and Rachel for ten years now. But now, I'm with Julie, so it's like me and Julie, me and Rachel, me and Julie, me and... ... Rachel. Rachel, Rachel.
Yeah!
No!! No!! I wanna stay. I wanna talk about this.
Oh, now you want a favour?
Yeah, well, Hurricane Gloria didn't break the porch swing, Monica did!
....right? Right? I mean it's pretty unbelievable y'know, I mean they just took off, took off without even looking back. Y'know I don't, I don't need them, huh, I've got you guys now as friends, you and Susan.
That's... that's classic.
Oh, you could just go uh, "greatest of ease... BAH-bah-bha-bhannn." Then go right into it.
Yeah?
I think It's the most beautiful table I've ever seen.
It's the dog.
Where ya goin'?
So? Sure! But it-it wouldn't be anything romantic. And I'm-I'm dating Mona-Damnit Mona! I was supposed to meet her like an hour ago! What is wrong with me?!
No no, you're fine, you're fine.
Like what?
Hi Aunt Lisa, Uncle Dan.
Ok, when you walk in the museum, take the right, that's the antiquities wing. Ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, up to the Byzantine Empire.
Remember the Russian satellite, Sputnik? Well, I'm a potato or a...spud. And these are my antennae. So Sputnik, becomes... Spud-nik. Spudnik!
Bye Janine!
No they don't!!! Well they should put it in huge black letters!!!!
Cat!
Ben! I mean, Ben! Ben!
Oh man.
Hey there little fella! Hey, uh-hey, why don't we get some shoes on ya, huh? Hey, why don't you show dad how you can put your shoes on, in your room! Yay!!
So tell me something. What does the phrase 'no date pact' mean to you?
No! No! I'm not! It's-it's-it's perfect! I mean it's better than you just-just moving here, 'cause it's us together forever, and that's-that's what I want.
That's ok. Uh, anyway, well he and I both really liked you a lot, uhm, but we didn't want anything to jeopardize our friendship, so we kinda made a pact, that neither of us could ask you out!
No! And somehow, we ended up with a joint checking account.
No.
Right, I'm gonna go talk to Joey. I think this is the right time. He's always in a good mood after the flight attendant says "duty free".
No, no I don't, because it's being restrung, somebody was supposed to bring me one.
I'm going to...uh...I'm going to, um, put the bourbon in it at home.
All right.
Noo, nnnnn. What does this mean? What do you, I mean do you wanna, get back together?
I never gave it to you.
All right Pheebs, your cab's ready.
Well, I'll-I'll be there. I mean I have to wear a costume to all my classes that day anyway so...
It was. It was an amazing night.
Hey listen can you do me a big favor? The dean's office just called and said there was an urgent meeting. Can you watch Ben for like an hour?
What are you guys doing?
What?!
Hiiiiii.
That-that-that's all right, no honey, you take your time sweetie. I'll be right out here. She's just fixing her makeup.
Rach?
Yeah, we're done.
Yeah, I'm gonna stay and read my book. I just wanna be alone right now.
And yet somehow it's true!
She says Marcel's humping thing's not a phase. Apparently he's reached sexual maturity.
Not there.
And then, you try to make the best of a bad situation, so you float the idea of a threesome?
Eh..actually no, I don't need to because your little "Ross is dead" joke didn't work, ok, there were no responses. Nobody posted anything on the website, nobody called my parents, so the joke my friend is on you. Nobody called, nobody wrote anything, nobody cares that I'm dead. Oh my God! Nobody cares that I'm dead!?
You mean hardball?
Oh, that's not cool.
Hi.
Oh dude, don't worry about it, I found an unattended maid's car. We're way ahead of the game. Ross: Oh my god.
Oh my god, you know what, yeah, I think you're right. I think ... listen, listen!
Well, eww. What? Is it a pimple?
The fear of Triscuts!
Hi.
Hey, I thought I cheered you up.
What?
Okay! Ho-ho! We did not steal your thunder because we are not getting back together!
So were you in Nam?
Yes, but I did make a pyramid out of the bath products. This is amazing, thank you, thank you so much. That's a pretty necklace.
Wow, it really is!
I can't believe this!!
How's the hair?
I told mom and dad last night, they seemed to take it pretty well.
We love marriage!
What, it's gonna be Helen Willick?
Come again? What's-what's this nonsense? All right, I'm-I'm not English. I'm from Long Island. I was really nervous and the accent just uh, just came out. I'm sorry. So, if we could just get back to the lecture. Umm, were there any questions? About paleontology. All right, look I was just trying to make a good first impression. Obviously, I screwed up. But what you guys think of me is really important because I'm-I'm hoping to get a permanent job here. So if you just give me another chance to make a good impression...
So they ah, they all took off, it was pretty hard watching them go, y'know?
Oh, no!
Of course! It all adds up! I mean you you're obsessed with her. It's always, "Ross, what are you gonna do about Rachel?" "Ross, why-why are you moving in with Rachel?" "When are you gonna confess your secret marriage to Rachel?" You want her!
Rach, come on, I'm not gonna wear any of this! Nothing silver. . Ok? Nothing with hair! And nothing with padlocks on it! .
I was just outside Barcelona, hiking...
Hey! Oh listen, I was just clearing some space for your stuff.
Joey, give me the bag.
Well yeah-yeah the Scottish history is so much more...
Oh, yeah, well y'know Chandler printed it up on his computer.
Okay! All right! Now, Chandler you-you wanna live with Monica, right?
He couldn't even tell me! He said it was just some sort of skin... abnormality. And the worst thing is he-he-he said, he said, without being able to identify it, he was reluctant to remove it.
I don't know, I-I was all high.
So you don't wanna go to Williamsburg?
Pheebs, you're talking about putting your body through an awful lot, I mean morning sickness, uhh, labour, and it's all for somebody else!
Not like this!
Because! Because, it-it-it's... It'd be like you having this guitar and-and never playing it. Okay, this guitar wants to be played! And-and this bike wants to be ridden and-and if you don't ride it you-you're-you're killing its spirit! The bike is dying.
Jill, how did you pay for all this? I thought your dad took away your credit card.
Look, G. I. Joe's in, Barbi's out. And if you guys can't deal with it, that's your 'too bad.'
Okay. Now-now-now should I climb down your front so we're face to face or-or should I climb down your back so we're-we're butt to face.
Guess who's a finalist for a huge research grant! I'll give you a hint, he's looking right at you.
Getting it away from me would be job one.
So, what's going on now?
He is saving your butt, ah, unless of course I'm stepping on some toes here, in which case I can just mosey on, I've got plenty of people to help on the Interstate.
Huh. Well, good luck to Dad. Say, how many more boxes would you have to sell in order to win?
It's ok, because they have to get it out of their system, okay , but you're going to realize, this is the only place, you wanna be.
Anyway... seriously, uh...just...just talk to the guy, okay? And tell me how it goes.
Yeah!
Oh no, not yet.
Oh, she isn't home.
Joey, we just saw you come in. You ran past us on the stairs.
I'm not getting you a muffin!
Just a high pitched intimidating noise.
I'm getting married, to..day!!
Yes, we did, everything's A-OK!
It's in Barbados.
Well, anyway, it was a good thing Phoebe knew the knew him, because I was about to do some serious damage!
But wait, there's more. Hey, Chandler, what is in the envelope?
Oh, I know. Y'know, just-just talking about it is getting me kinda...
Umm, candles, champagne, yeah anniversaries are great. 'Cause you know love lasts forever, y'know. Nothing like it in this lifetime, money in the bank, so Rachel and I broke up.
Okay, Phoebe, this Dr. Oberman. He has no strong feelings about Fonzie or any of the Happy Days gang.
No, that that is not what we're saying.
Yeah, yeah. I got a lemon schmush.
I do have a newfound respect for life.
Yeah, you want 55-JUMBO. Yeah, that's right. That's right, JUMBO with a U, sir. No, belive me, you don't want me. Judging by his number, I'd be a huge disappointment. All rightie, bye bye.
Okay.
Wow!
You do Pheebs?
Actually it's more like this.
Ok, we gotta go, yeah? So, we'll see you guys tomorrow.
Gentlemen, you're pick.
About yesterday, I was really wrong. I am sorry.
Shake it!
Well, because y'know there are certain rules about this kind of stuff. You don't uh, you don't fool around with your uh, friend's ex-girlfriends or possible girlfriends or girls they're related to.
Uh. Would you guys mind giving us a minute?
Y'know we should probably ask the doctor if she even knows how to deliver a baby that's half human and half pure evil!
She was...
Dude, you didn't say Die Hard. Is everything okay?
No, I've looked everywhere!
It's too cold.
It's from Ross, it's a love bug.
I know! I know! Why do you guys need to have this conversation?! Huh? I mean no self-respecting man would ask a woman, "So, where is this going?"
Okay.
Umm...
Ohhh.
I'm shipping out tomorrow.
What? No-no, a lurker.
So how long are you in town?
She sweat, wet. got it going like a turbo 'vette.
I didn't know what I was taking full responsibility for! Okay?! I didn't finish the whole letter!
Hmm-Hmm-Hmm. Okay. I, uh, am from Long Island. I-I came to the city for college. Um, I, um, have a 5 year old son and in my spare time I like to read spy novels. But, but, let's talk more about you. Hmm.
Wh-What are you talking about? It wasn't a girl. It was this huge dude.
No. Did you?
Yeah!
Oh come on! Here we go! Stand by for mission countdown!
Hey! I just heard. What's up?
I'm not going nuts. Do you see me go nuts?
Pity food? Y'know what that's okay, all right, I don't need any of you to stay, okay nobody stays.
... finally...
... in a very real way we can bring the Mesozoic era into the 21st century. Thank you!
Yeah!
Rachel won't talk to me! She won't even open the door!
Seriously?
Maybe. But it wouldn't hurt to have a backup, you know? Uh, Rach-Rach, what were you thinking?
How do you think it's gonna look when you get her something incredibly meaningful and expensive and her boyfriend Joey gives her an orange?
Hey.
Dude, what are you doing?
Okay.
But I don't know it. What I do know is that you owe $2300 at Isn't it Chromantic.
Uh, well, don't worry, I'll use the gentle cycle. Ok, um, basically you wanna use one machine for all your whites, a whole nother machine for colors, and a third for your uh, your uh, delicates, and that would be your bras and your under-panty things.
Hey man.
Hey!
So I nodded off a little.
So, I just finished this fascinating book. By the year 2030, there'll be computers that can carry out the same amount of functions as an actual human brain. So theoretically you could download your thoughts and memories into this computer and-and-and live forever as a machine.
Ahh, what's a little mid-life crisis between friends?
I meant because the monkey in it reminds me of Marcel.
Okay, relax, relax. We are gonna be here for a while, it looks like, and we still have boyfriends and your career to cover.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What, you don't, uh, you don't believe in evolution?
I've gotta go, there's a deer just outside eating fruit from the orchard!
Alright. The, uh, the neighbours must be vacuuming. Well, so long as we're here and, uh, not on the subject, I was thinking about, uh, how mad we got at each other before, and, um, I was thinking maybe it was partially because of how we, um...
No! I'll be right back.
Five to be lying, six.
I don't know you'd be so bored with marriage. I mean it's so... normal.
Man... I... I'm sorry.
Ah, so then his plane didn't explode in a big ball of fire?... Just a dream I had- but, phew.
You know how close women can get.
Yeah.
Wow!
What?
Seriously... What is it?
I like this one. It seems to say, "I love you and that's why I have to kill you."
Correct! What is Chandler Bing's job?
Oh Joey, Joey! But still, I mean, it seems like you guys are having a great time together.
See, I told you!
Answer faster, answer faster!
Okay, uhm... Hey, you guys seen Joey anywhere?
Sure, sweepin'. You never know.
Yeah.
Guess whose middle name is Muriel.
Wh-wh-what line? The line that prompted a student in my last class of the day to say uh, "Dude, don't you ever was your face?"
I can do that.
Of course not, I'm... suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch.
What? Of course you can! Hop on!
Right, will you excuse us for one moment? What are you doing?
No! No, I don't...don't want to.
Why don't you come, I mean, I-I have two tickets, why not?
It was you, pal.
You know what, it's, it's better this way anyway. I mean I don't know what I was thinking, going down that road again with us. It's just much easier if we're just friends who have a kid.
Oh!
Okay, forward. Forward-Stop! Okay, back-Stop! Okay, forward-Stop! Stop! Stop!
No, it was a mistake! I made a mistake! Okay?
So?
Well if it doesn't matter to her, it doesn't matter to me! Still not yelling!
Hey, y'know while we're on that, when are you gonna tell my sister that you don't live here anymore.
Phoebe, you can't force kids to be friends.
Yes! You're the person who checked out my book?!
Well, I'm off to Carol's.
Are we really in Montreal?!
Look both, Joey and Monica feel the same way that I do. No-no-no-no.
Good! Me neither! So it's not a problem. We're just two friends who happen to be roommates.
And you made it through that? I wonder who's gonna play you in the movie!
All right, let's uh, let's bring it back down and-and try again.
Y'know, if, if this is too weird for you, we can still back out at...
So uh, Emily called last night...
Everything okay in there?
Things you find in the ocean, You're gonna be on "Pyramid"!!
That's it. That's it.
Oh hey, hey, huh, how about this weekend we have a laser disc marathon okay, and maybe a tournament on my new dart board? Huh, huh, what do you think? Two days of darts, it'll be great!
Okay, umm...
I can't believe I'm about to meet Benjamin Hobart. I've always thought of him as one of the people I'd invite to my fantasy dinner party. Do you think there's any chance he'll bring Christie Brinkley or C3PO?
No, you stop!
I hope you're a better father than you're a friend!!
They did?
Tonight.
Can't we just use a pen?
Come here. Listen, you deserve so much better than him...you know, I mean, you, you, you should be with a guy who knows what he has when he has you.
According to Chandler, what phenomenon scares the bejeezus out of him?
Well then a small one!! Listen, let's, we kinda have to get going!
I'd like to spin the wheel!
I'm sorry, my pie was, was in your hood. Now I just have to get the coffee out of that guy's pants and I'll be back in the hospital by 7.
Oh, it's not over!
Okay.
Well, if you see him could you please tell him I'm looking for him?
A tattoo? Why, why would you want to do that? Hi.
No. So what. So what if we get beaten up, maybe that's just something every man has to go through once in his life. Ya know, like a, like a right of passage or somethin'.
Well you're gonna be a wonderful grandma.
No.
I found a note on my door, "Come to Monica's quick, bring champagne and a Three Musketeers bar."
Look at you two, bonding, making us late for the airport so...
What?!
Wow! How'd you get in there?
Look, I'm sorry, but you guys are wrong. I just don't want to be divorced three times.
Yeah, ooh yeah, I think there is one from batch 17 left, uh... It's batch 16! 16 people! Get out of the way!
Why don't you use your Thesaurus?
No, it's my joke, it's mine. You can call them, they'll tell you.
Yeah! Oh yeah, you'll be fine! It-it'll be uh, just like bungy jumping. Y'know? But instead of bouncing back up you-you won't.
I dropped him off at Carol's. Anyway, it turns out that I'm not going to be able to get those tickets though.
We're sorry, Pheebs, we're sorry.
What?
Tho?
You still love me.
Hey!
Come here, Marcel. Sit here.
Great!
So you wanna buy a house in the 50's?
Much better.
Okay. Wow! This is going so well. Did you see us? Did you see?
How are we gonna decide who gets this?
Yeah. It would've been good if we had gotten in, but still real fun.
Oh, no! No-no! No, I tired! But I couldn't. That's why I'm here. Maybe we could attack them together? That-that's a no.
Okay, what does it mean?
So, your ex-boyfriend is gonna determine if your new boyfriend gets this grant? Wow, your new boyfriend is screwed!
Yes, professor Feesen-sen-stenlger... I'll be with you in one moment. So, I will take one box of the Thin Mints.
Hey, is Chandler here?
Ok, ok, here is to my sister, the newly-appointed head lunch chef--
I was doing great with Julie before I found out about you.
Please don't say naked chicks.
Maybe I should open a divorced men's club.
What's wrong? Are you okay?
That's okay. We'll talk about something else.
That does not sound stupid to me. You know, it's like the first time I had to make dinner for myself, after Carol left me? I'm sorry, that's all the time we have. Next on Ross... Uh-oh.
I don't want to do that.
Hey, I might!
Oh, oh, ok, great. You know what, while you're at it she said another word the other day, why don't you, why don't you look up: pbbqqt....
Mm-Hmm.
Oh no! It could be better, but it's gonna be okay, right?
What're you doing?
Oh, and also, he's, he's walkin' kind of funny, his left leg is moving a lot faster than his right leg, and he's in there just sort of y'know...
You're taking the word of a guy who has night vision goggles?
No!
Oh I, I don't-I don't think that would be the best idea.
But, won't she notice I have makeup on?
...which brings us back, of course, to Greely's theory of dominance. Okay, that-that's all for today. Oh, uh does anyone know where the Freeman building is?
Chandler-
What?! It is?!
What?!
Phoebe really likes the bike huh?
Something could've happened. All right? She-she really dug my slides. And-and she was definitely giving me the vibe.
I uh... I don't know. I mean I...I honestly didn't watch it.
No way.
Well umm, oh! I might be teaching another class this semester!
On behalf of everyone, I'd just like to say behuh.
Ah... Ah...Get out of here! Uh, meeting someone? Or-or are you just here to brush up on Marion's views on evolution?
Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now.
Yeah, well missy, you better be glad that list is laminated.
And then she said it was the perfect way to say goodbye.
Huh, I don't know what to pick. Am I more thankful for my divorce or my eviction? Hmm.
I'm sorry. What was I supposed to do stand up and shout 'Hey, Rachel, your butt is showing!'
I'll see you in the morning .
Yeah he was wasn't he.
Fine, two tickets, I need two tickets.
Phoebe, why'd you do it?
Wha? No no! Ah! All gone! So good! Maybe Chandler has some left.
And I too am just a love machine.
Okay.
Look. Look, my mom gave me that ring because she wanted me to propose to Rachel, but all I wanted to do is if she maybe...kinda...wanted ah...start...things up again.
Ok, Mom never hit.
OK, now, sit. OK.
Ok.
I don't know, I don't think mom and dad would mind. Remember when you were 9 and Richard was 30, how dad used to say, 'God I hope they get together.'
Oh, but he will. He still tells the story how Monica tried to escape from fat camp.
Yeah. She's putting her down now, that's her.
What?
And he's, he's a total stranger?
You sang Baby Got Back didn't you?
I think you would have to clean a whole lot of apartments to go all the way to India.
You even have to ask?! He is alive!
Wow! It looks like we got a lot of good stuff.
Where in Cuba?
But, what's great is that you don't mind talking about it.
You know how you throw your jacket on a chair at the end of the day?
To London! Come to London. Please? It'll mean so much to me.
Six months Rachel, six months.
I don't know, I'm one sorry polentologist. All right Joey, we get it. I'm sorry.
Hi.
Yeah, I'm just gonna grab my coat. And uh, and my whip. Y'know because of the Indiana Jones? Not-not because I'm-I'm into S&M. I'm not-I'm not into anything weird. Y'know? Just-just normal sex. So, I'm gonna grab my coat.
Yeah? How'd it go?
Hey! So ah, what did the insurance company say?
We, we just decided to uh, to go for it.
That! Let's talk about that.
Yeah!
You ate my sandwich?
Okay, it's second down. Take all the second downs you need.
Hey.
What-what do you mean?
No... I already e-mailed her.
Uh, excuse me, uh, where can we find the monkey?
Oh, we went to see a collection of Victorian doorknobs and the Cupert-Hewitt museum.
Hey!
Apparently, he told Johnny Shapiro that she's quite a girl. In fact, he told Johnny that he thinks he's falling in love with her.
Well, I know the other day in the coffeehouse you were caught up in the whole soccer mom thing? but is that really you? I mean can you honestly picture yourself in a Volvo?
Uh yeah! Let me, let me get that for you.
...is for me not to see you anymore.
Where is she?
Oh yeah! So ah, kinda pretty, pretty good. He sounds like a nice, good guy.
What are you guys doing?
Uh-hmm.
No.
Right. Right, okay, okay. I'm sorry. I'm sorry I yelled.
You broke the pact!
Anyway, I figured after work I'd go pick up a bottle of wine, go over there and, uh, try to woo her.
Oh well, I guess I'll catch up with her later.
Y'know, I don't think we're going to settle this.
And what are you going to do for him?
Huh!
Rach, c'mon, Emma is fine. You're turning into an obsessive mother. Okay, you need to stop.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. You looked at her. You never look. You just answer, it's just a reflex. Do I look fat? Nooo! Is she prettier than I am? Noo! Does size matter?
Uh no-no, she-she's out for the night.
You got me.
Well, c'mon. Don't ya want to find out?
...since I stopped trying.
Ma, you're asking me to marry you?
No-no. It's-it's me, Ross!
Yeah, just a little in high school, but then I really got into it in college. I mean that's-that's when I really found my sound.
What kind of problem?
Uhh, yes I did but there isn't. Okay, here we go.
Hi!
Yeah.
What?! Hello! We didn't get married.
Thank you so much for coming back over.
Joey, had an imaginary childhood friend. His name was?
I know.
It's been sixteen years but the air quotes still hurt.
Hey, Pheebs.
I'm an idiot. I mean shoulda seen it, I mean Carol and I'd be out and she'd, she'd see some beautiful woman, and, and she'd be Ross y'know look at her, and I'd think, God, my wife is cool!
Hi roomie!
You're drunk! Mom and dad are gonna be maaaaadd! Maybe I'm a little drunk.
I like this song.
Oh. Oh. Thank God, most women don't even feel them.
You got it.
So that's the only reason she could be here huh? It couldn't have anything to do with the fact that-that maybe I'm a good listener and I uh I put on a great slide show!
Yeah, but wait...
Oo-oo!
Hey look, Phoebe. I, uh, I laid out the states geographically...
Hey, if that's what you want to do I'm not gonna say no.
I think you need to tell her how you feel.
Lighter than air... But that's not the point.
Hey, is Rachel here?
Yeah, me too.
I gotta get going. Bye Chandler.
Yeah, and she still wants to go! It's pretty clear where she is.
Ok, um, uh, more clothes in the dryer? I'm fine, I'm fine.
Good morning. Hey pal, look who I brought. It's your old friend Harry Elefante.
Huh, what's fish hooking... Thanks man, that would have been really hard to describe. What is that taste?
It felt like a 'big guy' moment.
Ya.
No, no, we want to wait, right?
Hi, Mrs. Green.
What woman?
Wha-I'm having, I'm having a boy! Huh, am I having a boy?
Hey, y'know if you want to pick up some extra cash? Some friends of mine made good money doing telemarketing.
Fine. Fine, alright, now you'll never know.
Why?
I've seen her at work, but I always figured, ah-huh? But, uh, I made her dinner. We had a great time. And we're going out again tomorrow.
You slept with my sister?
Well, I tracked down Marcel and get this, he's healthy, he's happy, and he's right here in New York filming Outbreak II - The Virus Takes Manhattan.
No-no, it's not that, it's just... I-I just moved in.
Can I see you for a second?
Umm, I'm sorry Judy, I couldn't find that bowl that you and Jack were looking for.
All right, fine! Fine! Have me fired! But uh, I want you to know that you and I are not all that different. I mean, I too am a neat guy.
Y'know I remember when uh, when I was in college, we used to...
Hey!
And that should conclusively prove that I had the idea for Jurassic Park first! Now let's take a look at...
What? Why not?
Right, no, I understand.
Thank you, but, but you gotta leave.
Mitzi is.....
You know, you are so amazing, is there anything you, you don't know?
I see. You didn't happen to tell.
Oh, hey, Gunther, check this out.
You know what, you guys, we don't have to watch this.
Hey, what's behind your back?
Exactly!!
People ask me why we're not together, I just don't know what to tell them.
Hello. Hi sweetie. Good. Look umm, yes I've been thinking about that thing that you wanted me to do and, I can do it. So will you come to New York?
Get to the problem!
Don't blame the questions!
Oh, I-I don't think there's any trail.
Hey Pheebs! How's that uh, vegetarian pizza working out for ya? You and those vegetables have a real thing going on, huh?
Look, I'm sorry, I thought it looked pretty.
There's an image.
Was there...uh, huh, huh, huh... andybody, anybody else there.
I know.
No.
Some of your old stuff.
I know, I know. I shouldn't have waited 'till now to say it, but I'm.. That was stupid, okay? I'm sorry, but I'm telling you now. I love you. Do not get on this plane.
The judge wouldn't let us get an annulment! Now we gotta get a divorce!! Did a Porsch throw up on you?
You told her before you told us?
And in about five seconds you're gonna see why.
Hey, Fun Bobby!
I play squash...! Anyway, uhm... I uhm... I always get the feeling he thought I was too sensitive.
Oh...
C'mon.
So do you have like any nuclear weapons on board?
Mon?
Must pee.
Okay, so I'm gonna be the only one standing there alone when the ball drops?
Ohhh.
Hey Amy.
Oh, that's right! Daddy and uncle Joey are going on a trip today. We're going to a conference in Barbados, right?
That is Mark?
Does she.
Sure! Uh, let me get it for ya.
What? Your-your list?
Female body inspector? What size is that?
"... Sarah. I dig you", Uh? "Doctor Ross Geller".
Thank you. C'mon, Marcel, whaddya say you and I do a little mingling? Alright, I'll, uh... catch up with you later.
Wow! Wow, You look . . . uh . . . It's just, ah . . . That dress . . . uh . . .
Sure, what's up?
Pheebs, what, is it the age thing?
Yes! My baby's finally free!
Monica's right, swing dancing can be tricky. I'm gonna use the phone. I gotta cancel those five giant teddy bears I sent to Emily. My God, think of the massacre.
Come on up. I'm gonna get the rest of his stuff together.
Yes, I suppose I am a dog. But Issac, see I-I happen to have a girlfriend.
Oh, what were the other two?
Eh, her-her uncle already had planned on doing it. And y'know, we-we said our good-byes this morning, so...
Ah! Ah! I forgot my jacket!
Oh you guys are not gonna believe what happened.
Yeah. Op! Uh-oh! I think your Dad must've added wrong. He only tipped like four percent.
I was not!
We're having a baby.
I got it. Uh, Joey, women don't have Adam's apples.
Okay, I know what I have to do. I've got to go Red Ross. Y'know, Red Ross!
Oh, shhh, shh. Magic is about to happen.
Ok well, I would like to do a dig in the painted desert.
Hey!
You're welcome.
So we're a little late.
Yeah.
Not even if Carol's breast had a picture of a missing child on it.
I can't believe this, I thought we were all in this together!
Hey!
Yeah.
Oh you guys, I-I really think just one of us should go out there so she's not overwhelmed...
Yeah, losers talk!
You were worried about me? You didn't know how I was going to react?
Oh. Oh, that's right. So-so you did see me that day because it seemed like you didn't.
Y'know I have dinner plans!!
I did not freak out.
Dude!
Just some boys gave me their phone numbers.
No, no. I-I'm good.
Hey! Oh, I'm so glad you guys are here. I've been dying to tell someone what happened in the Paleontology department today.
Oh-oh, absolutely!
And! We should keep all the stuff uh, we told each other secret from everybody else.
Okay.
Okay, I have a problem I have to go into work for a few hours, some kids messed up the Homo Sapien display.
I-I-am-
Well, he said there's definitely nothing to worry about, it's totally benign.
Well... you never know. How's, um.. how's the family?
but you, your so much better off you just go from guy to guy having fun and never worrying that it terns into anything serious.
All right, here's the ring.
Ok. Well, before I say anything, I just need to know, is this one of those things where you break up with a guy, and then I tell you what I think, and then the next day you get back together with the guy, and I look like a complete idiot?
No, 10 is the highest.
So, why is Erica coming to visit?
It's a great class.
Yeah, uhm... I mean, Rachel and I, think you are great... with Emma... uhm... We just feel...
Yeah, that way I figure, ya know, we'll be far enough away from our parents that we don't have to see them all the time but close enough that they can come over and babysit whenever we want. And yes, I know, the taxes are a little higher than, let's say, Nassau county but the school system's supposedly great.
We'll give you Janice.
Not, not, not every night. You know, and... and it's not like I didn't try, Rachel, but things got in the way, y'know? Like, like Italian guys or ex-fiances or, or, or Italian guys.
I'm telling you, this guy Rachel is with is crazy! Okay? He viscously screamed at total strangers! I think he's baaad news!
Listen, listen. Whoever you pick is gonna walk down the aisle with you! Now, I promise I won't say a word, but if you pick Chandler he's gonna be whispering stupid jokes in your ear the whole time!
Don't ask me, I had it and I blew it!
Yeah, well excuse me for wanting to be with my girlfriend on our anniversary, boy what an ass am I.
Aww. Thank you, Aunt Phoebe.
Oh. Hel-lo!
Hi!
Oh! Oh-oh, the band's ready! Well, I-I-we gotta do what the band says-I don't care about the stupid band!!
So, so, is Mike coming to dinner?
How great is this? You are already comfortable enough to look through my stuff. Oh, I am sorry Michelle, that'smy roommate, Rachel.
What was, what was that?
Oh that is quite all right ma'am.
No, no way. You've got it totally the other way around my friend. John Voit was...
Great. So let's get going?
Wow!
No, of course not! ...Yeah, yeah, it is.
How do you feel about all this?
Look, okay-okay I had food poisoning! It's not like I choose to do it! It's not like-It's not like I said, "Umm, what would make this ride more fun?!"
Because It's The Highest. Situation No.1 You're with Monica, the wedding is about to start when Monica gets cold feet. Go!
But I-I was going to see if y'know, maybe you uh, start dating again but that-I mean that-that was all, Rach.
Yeah. He could row like a viking.
Yeah? Me too. Gettin' a little tired though.
That commercial always makes me so sad.
Hey, here's a theme: Come on in, live like bacon.
Hey, Joey. You wanna open the window?
Oh, hey...
Haha! Got ya! Die, die, die!
I can't believe we're gonna be the only people that aren't in this wedding.
And I'm fine never having heard it... Rach, can I... can I see you for a sec?
Oh-oh, yeah.
Okay. But not about this!
That only is not funny, it's physically impossible! Ok? Depending on the species I'd have to have a six foot long... It's not funny!!
Oh nothing. Nothing! Just uh, you've been a little short with me lately. I'm not trying to irritate you.
Yeah.
Hi! Sorry I'm late. Were you sleeping?
Why wouldn't I want to come? I had fun at the first wedding.
I'm gonna get you to talk to Chandler.
Wha-? Oh, come on. You didn't have to-saltwater taffy?! Thanks! This is interesting. You know, most people think this is made with sea water, but it's actually made with, uh, salted fresh water. That's not interesting.
We're not gonna do that.
W-What was the one right before bananas?
Ok, I'll be home right after work. Ok, by Emma-Wemma-Demma, I love you - wovyou dovyou ...
What? Rach! Come on, that's terrible! They're...uh...they're babies. They're-they're all beautiful.
You and your ice.
Oh, well this morning he got a call from who I think was our cousin Nathan, and frankly, it was a little more than I needed to know.
Wait! Wait! Wait! Y'know what? Just stay. Please? It uh... It would really mean a lot to me if you stayed.
I am like Indiana Jones.
Probably shouldn't touch me.
Well, okay so, I don't have it all worked out quite yet. Just don't say anything to Rachel, please?
Take thee, Emily. Like there'd be anybody else.
No, no, no just do it. Go in there and pick something out so we can go.
Well, there you go.
Mine.
What the hell are you doing?
That is really nice...lying! No way is that the reason!
Oh. Okay, just breathe.
Veto.
Here we go. Y'know, I've-I've never played my stuff for anyone before, so it's important that-that you understand it's about communicating very private emotions. Y'know, umm, you should-you should think of umm, my work as wordless sound poems. That's what I'm...
Would you excuse us for a second? Umm.... what are you doing?
For what?
Oh my God! Monica!
What, I mean, a little, but no, what, go on.
It's hard to tell because I'm sweating, but I use exactly what the gel bottle says, an amount about the size of a pea. How, how can that be too much?
That'd be good...
Who gets whom. I don't know why I do that.
Sure. By the way, there's a difference between being obsessive and. . .
But is it technically a date if the other person doesn't show up?
I'm a four?
We were drunk! I would've married uh, Joey with that amount of alcohol!
Oh y'know, I still-I can't believe it. Joey and Rachel I mean it's... It's like you and me going out, only weirder!
Think he washed his hands?
Uh, double latte, extra foam.
Am I?! And was it your idea to postpone the wedding?!
You comin'?
Turn! Turn!
Wait, well wh-wh-wh-where is she?
Hey uh, this is Elizabeth.
Yeah-oh! Hey listen umm, Emily found this wedding dress in London...
Yeah?
You know what? This calls for a bottle of Israels finest.
What?
You'll see.
Who-who wants fair? Y'know, I just want things back. Y'know, the way they were.
Oh, it's not so bad. Monica's gonna make potpourri! I think I'm gonna go wander out in the rain for a while.
Oh.
I just wanna clarify this: are you outing Mr. Peanut?
Dad, I beg you not to finish that sentence.
Your Mom, your telling me, your telling me, about your Mom, what is the matter with you?
Oh, thank God!
No Phoebe, don't look! You don't want to see what's under there!!
So, Rach, y'know-y'know how Emily's coming right?
Who?
Huh.
Oh no-no-no-no!
Okay, okay, okay, I've got two cabs and no people. Go! Go! Go!
You look pretty tonight.
Right. Ohh! You-you want me to be your backup.
That's it? That's all you wrote? You're the worst writer in the whole world.
I can't believe this.
What's-what's going on?
Well, it needs to be plicit.
Hey Rach.
Well, I lost. Some little girl loaned her uniform to her nineteen year old sister, who went down to the U.S.S. Nimitz, and sold over 2,000 boxes.
Yeah! Oh, I-I love this babies!
Hey! It's starting to snow.
Ross, uh and uh, I'd just like to say that it did take a lot of courage for Rachel to come here tonight. And, uh, for the record she did not run out on Barry because she had syphilis. What are you doing I'm serious. Uh, the reason she walked out on, on Barry is simply that she didn't love him, which incidentally worked out pretty well for me Cheers.
It really was.
Ok, bye. Well, Monica's not coming, it's just gonna be me and Rachel.
Uh, I haven't.
Let's grab our stuff and get the hell out of here.
Yes, exactly!
Guess who's up for keynote speaker at the National Paleontology Conference?
I know it is pretty unbelievaaaaah.
It was 5:30 in the morning, and you had rambled on for 18 pages. Front and back!! Oh-oh-oh, and by the way, Y-O-U-apostrophe-R-E means 'you are,' Y-O-U-R means 'your!'
Wow! This is very flattering, uh...
Yeah, c'mon I mean I though, you know, I thought we're just foolin' around. Like when, uh, when we were kids.
Well, the stuff I just mentioned.
Well, oh, I'm sorry your car broke down Pheebs, but I'm a little too busy with some of my real friends right now, but please call to let me know you got home safely okay?
Yeah! I-I teach it in my class.
I don't know.
Oh my God, the wedding book?! I haven't seen that since the forth grade!
Uhh, it was okay. Yeah, it was fun.
Monica? You're Mom.

Okay.

Except we're not. I mean, we haven't been a couple in like, six years. Oh my god, is that right? Has it been that long?
No, you don't.
They kept your room for a while.
Not my first time in a hotel, my friend.
Okay sorry, whew.
There it is...
Weh...*sigh*
Okay.
Wow! I could've died tonight.
do you have a compact in your purse?
What?!
Oh yeah!
Hey Pheebs, what are you doing?
Look Rachel, I wanted to tell you, I thought I should, I-I did, and then Chandler and Joey convinced me not to.
So honey this uh, this threesome thing umm, I mean how-how are you gonna start to find...
Hey! There are some men who will do whatever it takes to make their marriage work! Okay? There are some men who will stand by and-and watch as their wives engage in-in what only can be described as a twosome with some-some woman she barely knows from the gym!
What happened you guys?
That's funny. Umm.... It's not funny.
Newly appointed head lunch chef who is also in charge of purchasing--
I think he can be.
And if you wait right here, I'll go get Ross.
I'm Ross Geller. Wha, I'm, God in your add you said you were pretty but wow.
Right.
I don't know. It's going to be weird not having a job for a while, but I, I definitely don't care about my sandwich.
All righty roo. What a great moment to say that for the first time.
Wait a minute; you don't think it was intentional? I mean, that's just stupid.
The nurse said they're bringing in another woman.
Maybe you should look up "fascinating."
Way to go guys. Y'know, you-you were really good at the stuff too.
What?!
Yeah, obvious beauty's the worst. You know, when it's right there in your face. Me, I like to have to work to find someone attractive. Makes me feel like I earned it.
Did you get Monica's authorization to move all of her stuff?
Sorry, sorry... Uh-oh.
Yes that's right.
Not all bad.
Can I talk to you for a minute?
What?! Why?!
Wow, uh, Joey that's-that's great. Thanks man.
No way!
What do you mean?
No.
Yeah right.
Thank you, thanks. Yeah, I lost it. Y'know, I'm not gonna play anymore, would you, can you finish my set?
So? What do you think?
Oh! That is so thoughtful. She's a keeper. And what did you bring me?
Evidently they do.
Yours, I just got 43 points for 'KIDNEY'.
Oh, I just thought we could go out to dinner, and then maybe bring her back to my place and I'd introduce her to my monkey.
Yeah, um, I don't know if you noticed, but he had a lot to drink, and you know how he gets when he's drun..uh... I can't do this, I did it, it was me, I'm sorry, I kissed your mom.
Sure. I'll help you.
I-I'm, I'm having a boy?
Yeah, they don't like you.
Hey!
OK. Hold my board.
We were all pretty shaken up about it.
Wait hold on Tony, hold on. Hello. Hi, yeah no, she's right here. Um hold on. Hi Tony, can I call you back? That's uh, that's my sister's boyfriend.
I'm telling you, just a little bit at a time.

I know, it's pretty great.
Ok, no, no, you hang up. You, you, y-
Stop going through my stuff ! Rachel: Hey!
Come on! That's great.
Why...Why should I? I mean if she wants to move on, that's fine!

Umm, say you're gonna be starving after all this moving. What do you say I take you to dinner tonight?
ON A CAT??!!!!
So this is an annual thing?
Do you want me too?
That-that would be incredible. Thank you so much. I-I still can't believe someone ate it!! I mean, look, I left a note and everything.
There's something new in the bowl.
This is Vicrum.
Noooo!!! Every time!!!
Okay. You know you probably didn't know this, but back in high school, I had a, um, major crush on you.
Hey.
I mean my God...
Toilet paper?
Shh! Shh! Shh!
And shame on you! You should know better, Joey needs to work. Now come on!
Wha-What?
Oh, hey, oh... I... I was-I was going for a hand shake.
Okay is there...some kind of magic tunnel to this hospital?!
Okay.
Yeah. Anyway umm, it probably worked out for the best.
So what do you want me to do?
Really? Wh-what's wrong?
He was unbelievable. He was like that-that-that Bugs Bunny cartoon where Bugs is playing all the positions, right, but instead of Bugs it was first base-Alan, second base-Alan, third base-...
It's really a uh-uh three person game, y'know?
Ah, I'm sorry.
I know.
Be-caaauuuse...
Like uh y'know like this! This! She-she could've made this!
Huh? I know, I know. Who am I? David Bowe?
Um, in Phoebe's room. You can't go in there.
Ehm... Her name is Emma.
Oh my God! I'm sorry, I was talking to this nurse, completely forgot.
What?
Ohh, it was the best!
Hey! Hey! Hey! I get to choose my best man, and I want both you guys.
Apparently, Sting's son made fun of the fact that Ben's moms are lesbinims.
Hi.
Yes! yes!
Yeah!
Whoa-whoa-whoa, hey! Now remember what we talked about, you gotta be strong.
Spiderman?
Yeah.
Ok!... Uh... excuse me? Yeah?
I know! Anyway, they asked me to be a guest lecturer! I mean it's temporary, but uh, if they like me it could lead to a full time job. How great would that look great on a mailbox, huh? "Professor Geller."
Oh, well...
Bye!
Mm-hmm..
C'mon, what's his name?
What?
No problem. I cannot wait for you to meet my friends.
What did you do to my mom?
So he's calling from Rome. I could do that. Just gotta go to Rome.
umm. that you had a six year long relationship with a guy named Vicrum.
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What's with the tackling?
No, but I wanna be. Hey, I will be. Besides, I'm with Charlie, right? Oh my god, I'm still with Charlie, aren't I? I mean, she didn't see the dance, did she?
I'd like to return this couch. I'm not satisfied with it.
One Mississipi, two Mississipi, Three Mis... WAIT! WAIT! I'm not-I've not finished counting!!
Hey! I just got uh, my teacher evaluations! Check out what this one student wrote, "I loved Dr. Geller's class. Mind blowing lectures! Dr. Geller, you are definitely the hottie of the paleontology department!"
What?
Yeah.
What?
What, uh... what juggling thing?
Yeah. Look if-if she's gonna end up with somebody else, the truth is she couldn't find a better guy. So...
DANGER!!! DANGER!!!!!
Alright, alright, maybe it'll take my mind off it. Do you promise to buy me a big thumb finger?
Hey, hi, hi!
Yeah-yeah you guys. Get out of here!
Hmm, yeah. Come on Ross jr. It's time to go in.
How could you have told her?
Wow! Sorry. So uh, how are the new people?
Phoebe! You're note, amazing! Not only did no one touch my sandwich, but people at work are actually afraid of me. Yeah, a guy called me mental! Mental Geller, yeah, I always wanted a cool nickname like that.
Fine.
Because tomorrow he's redoing yesterday's pages.
Hey, y'know, y'know what would make me really happy?
It was a dry day.
You know what? I know Chandler longer, so I always think of him as my best friend, but now... I may have to rethink some stuff...
Do you say this stuff to girls?
Is everything okay?
Chandler. I sensed it was you.
Oh no, maybe it's me, I'm just not giving you enough credit. Uh, I mean it is difficult to say goodbye to five people. Uh, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, good... IT'S PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE. You know what? After all we've been through, I can't believe this is how you want to leave things between us. Have a, have a good time in Paris.
Got me.
So?
I know, I wasn't finished. But don't worry! We're gonna go down the fire escape!!
Yes, I did.
Yes, that's what I have. It's not on the board.
OK sweetie, I'll see you later.
Call me!
Uh-huh.
No! Come on let's-One more time! One final push! Ready? 1...2...3!
Gunther have you uh, have you seen Chandler?
Yeah, if you're really hungry. It was a joke, I made a joke.
Fine! It's your life! I just don't want to see you guys break up! Which you will do if you move in together, but that's what you want, there's nothing I can do. DON'T DO IT!!!!!
Hm-mmm.
What? Fine? Because I am! Aren't you? Aren't you? Aren't you? You see? Who else is fine?
Remember when sometimes he'd borrow your hat, and, and when you got it back there'd be little monkey raisins in it.
Oh, good!
Huh.
What? NO! I am not going to give them Ben!
A green LeSabre?
I think this will be fine. Okay, vanilla milkshake, just a vanilla milkshake, with chicken bits floating in it. Cheers.
Oh my God! That's Rachel naked! I can't look at that! I am looking at this. Okay, vivid colors, expressive brush strokes-Unless she wants me to be looking at that. She knows I'm home. She knows I can see her. What kind of game is she playing? I think maybe someone's lonely tonight. Oh-ho, Dr. Geller! Stop it! You're being silly! Or, am I?
No, not a problem.
Open up. We want to talk to you.
Yeah. But, the good news is that Phoebe said that I could stay at her place for a while. So...
Why do you care so much?
That's who.
Oh, thank God!
Let-let me make sure I'm hearing this right, you're ending this with me because I'm too whiney? So you're saying, I've become so whiney that I annoy you, Janice.
Sweetie, it's be gonna okay, all right. It's a wedding, generally people focus on the bride.
Hey, hey, it's fine. It's totally fine. We've got plenty of margaritas. It's all good.
Hey, where's Chandler?
Hey!
Have you seen this? It's a new alumni website for college! It's cool! You can post messages for people, let everyone know what you're up to.
Yeah.
Y'know, it-it doesn't matter. The important thing is that you're here. You're my friend, and you're here. Oh!
Look, no-no, hey, hey, don't worry about it! In nine years, she and I will be right there.
What?
Is there somebody else?
Hi.
O-ok. Just relax, Phoene, just stay calm. . Oh my god, I can't find my wallet.
Oh yeah, why not?
Rachel one brunch is not gonna solve anything. You gotta face it, okay we're never gonna get along.
Yeah, yeah! You sure this is what you want?
And confused. Rach, sweetie, I-I um...I didn't propose to you.
I guess so.
Yes. I was just warming up the earpieces for you.
OK, here goes.
A superhuman thirst for knowledge.
Are you OK?
This is not fun!
Oh no! It could be better, but it's gonna be okay, right?
I'm sorry I didn't catch.
Hey guys!
Ezel! Hey Gunther! You're an ezel!
Well you shouldn't be. Believe me I wouldn't want to be the guy who's up against you. I mean that doofus is going to lose!
I went thru this with Ben and Carol. One cup of coffee won't affect your milk.
Look, Rachel, this is poker. I play to win, alright? In order for me to win, other people have to lose. So if you're gonna play poker with me, don't expect me to be a 'nice guy,' OK? Cause once those cards are dealt...
You... you dated Albert Wintermeyer?
Joey, you are gonna love this guy. Gandolf is like the party wizard!
That's different, okay. That's like, uh 'Who dated a stripper?' or 'Who did it on the back of the Staton Island Ferry?'.
I wasn't talking to you.
Come on, it's fun!
Okay, that's, that's enough.
OK, well, um, have a nice evening.
It's not the same.
Oh, come on Rach, we will. I promise. We have more interviews And worse comes to worse, we can always reconsider the uhm... the first one we met with.
I'm having a son. Um...
So, for the whole weekend?
Alright, you madcap gal. Try to imagine this. The phone bill arrives, but you don't pay it right away.
Okay. Well, apparently Chandler's angry at us for not getting him a ticket to that Knicks game a couple of weeks ago.
No you didn't.
I'd like that.
Good luck.
Alright, shall we?
Huh? Oh-oh, it was fine. Uh, it was just a misunderstanding. She didn't want me to go with her. She just wanted to let me know that she's going to Florida for spring vacation.
Well, I can't say any of us were surprised. Your parents have been unhappy ever since we've known them. Especially after that incident in Hawaii.
Five.
Who's your roommate?
Erica, those things aren't free. In fact they have one of the highest mark-ups of any consumer product...
Why not?
Well, I came with Rachel, who should be back any second! So what's new?
What are you doing up?
Me either...
Don't blame the questions!
Yes, but I don't wanna die in your cab!
Okay, okay. Look, you have got to go to a doctor! Okay?
Listen, I'm- I'm sorry I was so hard on you before, it's just I...
Hey!
Is that what I want?
Yes, you're right. Still somebody must have seen it... I mean, I went to that school for 4 years, I didn't have an impact on anyone?
You got it! . All right, she's right, we gotta get serious. Let's put styrofoam peanuts down his pants and kick him!
You-you had what?
Oh, I uh, hope you don't mind, I kinda uh, jazzed it up a little. Check this out. We will, we will, call you back!
No, no, no, no, no, no, not out of that, not out of clothes.
And, I love you!!
...can't, can't a guy send a barbershop quartet to his girlfriend's office anymorrrrre!!
Hi! Hi, I'm uh Ross. I'm here to ruin this magical day for you.
I'm still hungry!
No. I'm saying it's now.
Okay, Phoebe just-just get-get on the bike and-Hey! I'll hold you up and-and push you. Okay?
Look, this is just a little too familiar, okay? For like, for Like six months before Carol and I spilt up, all I heard was "My friend Susan is so smart. My friend Susan is so funny. My friend Susan is so great."
The screaming guy?
Hey. How did you sleep?
Hey!
Well..
Uhh, hey look, I don't really enjoy being with other men that way. But, um, zoo dollars?
You were under the pile of coats?
Well, we're all here! I guess we should get going!
No? What happened, big guy?
And that's not against your oath?!
Hey!
Calm down, I'm blow drying.
Yeah, can't help but.
You couldn't let me have her, could ya?!
That's right! That's right! Saran Wrap on the toilet seat so the pee goes everywhere!
Hey, come on in.
I'm the ring bearer.
Oh, I believe I had the half-drunk cappuccino with the lipstick on the rim.
Yeah I am! Yeah, Ben got a second audition!
So uh, any ideas for the bachelor party yet?
Really?! So what would you say Pheebs? Stuff like uh, "Keep your mitts off my grub?"
Wow, this is really soft . Three hundred and fifty dollars?
Now that's a little spoiled. He was supposed to type "little", the idiot.
You're welcome.
Hi Pheebs!
Hey, you know what I just realized? If you guys ever have kids...
Eh, you got a spray-on tan?
Okay, good-good for you.
All right. 'Candy and Cookie?'
Will, high school was-was a long time ago.
It's a clown kit! Clown kit!
Wow! You look nice. What's the occasion?
We'll each tell you how we came up with the joke and then you decide which one of us is telling the truth-me.
Can't wait.
No!
Okay?
What?
Oh, hello.
Hey, how's it going?
How, how, um how can you not be going?
I am a good kisser.
At the coffeehouse, right.
So this is your office?
So I asked Emily if she would come to New York, and she said yes.
Okay.
I'm gonna get a new band-aid. Hey, how 'bout the time I cut the legs off your Malibu Ken?
Yeah, Susan.
Hello.
Why?
What about the chairs?
Oh, it looks like mom and dad's house. Oh, it even has a tree with a broken limb out front and the uh, the window in the attic is...Oh my God!!
Emily.
Wait, wait, wait.
I don't know, umm...
No, no, we won't.
Hey, I've been doin' it since the ninth grade, I've gotten pretty damn good at it.
My nana used to do it. That's how she paid for all my dance-karate lessons.
Oh, wake up!
What was Monica's nickname when she was a field hockey goalie?
Sorry.
Am I supposed to stand here and listen to this on my birthday?
That's funny...Do you think you'll ever work again?
Yeah.
Well that's different! Okay? Because he, he was actually in love with me!
I was up all night writing this really nasty letter to Emily! It was perfect and now it's all covered in-in... Actually, thanks!
Okay when you're playing a machine and it hasn't paid out, a lurker waits for you to give up and then...
Well, I tried! But when I got to my lawyer's office all I could hear was, "Three divorces. Three divorces!" Look, I just don't want my tombstone to read, Ross Gellar, Three Divorces.
Well, I don't know.
All right-all right, fine! I-I'm gonna call the cops!
I'm giving this lecture on erosion theories tomorrow night, I think you should come.
Whoah, uh, what happened to, uh, 'Forget relationships! I'm done with men!' The whole, uh, penis embargo?
Yeah.
Okay-okay! Two very good points, look I've known you both a long time, and I've never seen either of you one/millionth as happy as you've been since you've got together. Do you really want to throw that all away over a room? That is so silly. Now wh-what is more important, love or silliness?
For your information, it's a card sharp, not a card shark.
I'm-I'm Ross by the way.
I have no idea!
That's okay, I'm cool over here. I'll catch up with you later, Joey.
Yes.
Yeah.
Really? Yeah that-that sounds interesting.
What?
Well, she wore it all Christmas day, and then uh...
All right.
I just, I had to see you one more time before you took-off.
That's okay Rach, we're not liking Ross right now.
All right then. Rachel Green! Let's play Bamboozled! How do you test the temperature of the baby's bath water?
'That' would be Marcel. You wanna say hi?
Hey!
That's a good point. So uh, how long are you gonna punish him?
I wanna say it's not looking good.
Yeah, pants, what, what an idea. Or better yet, um, how 'bout you go without any pants. Look, I don't know what you're trying to do to me, but just get your butt in there and pick out any shoes that fit your feet, okay. No, no I don't care if they match. I don't care if they make your ankles or your knees or your earlobes look fat. Okay.
I'm kinda beat.
What? No! No, I'm not stopping. I'm Red Ross!
Yeah!!!
Yeah, I know. I mean, no, you're right. Yeah I guess I'll let it go. But you-you understand how-how hard it is to forget about this.
No, actually I thought about it when, when we were going out. It's how I imagined I uh, I would ask you to marry me.
And smart!
Thanks. You ready to go?
Okay, you go grab it!
Hey! Guess what I got for your wedding!
Everyone? I would like to make a toast to Rachel and Joey.
Huh?
Hi.
Hi. I-I hear you're going on a ferry tonight.
Hey, how was the Met?
Uh-huh, I see that.
Oh my God, wh-what happened?
Look at you! What-You're-you're this big executive! You are much more capable than you give yourself credit for. I-I have no doubt you're gonna be an incredible mother.
God, you're amazing... I didn't even have to ask you to call me that.
Oh yeah, yeah we're moving forward. You'll be getting our card!
Im gonna be a father.
Sure.
Hey, whatever it is, I am sure it has happened to me. Y'know, actually once-once I got dumped during sex.
Maybe I should stand on your feet!
Hey, what are you guys, what are you guys talking about?
Oh my God!
Oh, really!
Oh! Wow! Uh, yeah! That sounds great. I'm just gonna put this back in my pocket, pretend that didn't happen. Uh yeah, actually I'm free now. Do you wanna grab some coffee or...
So I don't wanna be just anybody.
That guy Mark. From Bloomingdale's... She thinks he's just being nice to her. But I know he really wants to sleep with her.
Who did?!
Huh, I'm just saying...
You were the 200-pound 11-year-old who rode her!
Huh?
Okay.
What about Emma? We don't have a nanny.
You want me to take some girl I've never met to the opera so you can go to a club and flirt with some guy, hmm, that-that is a toughie.
I can't believe you hated me.
That's right!
No!
Hey!
I'm feeling better.
Oh, but-but I can't do it.
She, she was different.
No, no, uh, it's not what you think. It's um the other thing.
Yeah.
I'm good. I'm good.
What's going on?
Hey!
Hey! I did not dump Rachel! Nor are we still together. Can I just... Why don't we just let the machine get that?
No! The guy is mean. I mean really mean. I think you should stay away from him.
Yes, it was the trophy you got if you won the game. But our Dad said, 'nobody won that game, ' and he was sick of our fighting, so he took the trophy and.... threw it in the lake.
Hi. I understand you had a little talk with Emily.
Besides, there's a big age difference.
"A donation has been made in your name to the New York City Ballet." -- How did you know?
Try the bottom one.
He is my girlfriend's father, okay? It's-it's, it's weird!
All right. I think it was a mouse.
Yeah, right.
Why would I eat my own arm?
What? You have a date? Who with?
Even though you do do a good Bob impression, I'm thinkin' when she sees you tomorow, she's probably gonna realize, "hey, you're not Bob."
Wow, did not know that! May I say how lovely you look today?
It's not that. Okay? Annulments are more complicated than I...
Hi! What are you, what are you doing here?
No, come on don't start. Ouch!
WE WERE ON A BREAK!!!!!!!
Okay.
Sure! Hey, I just found out, I get Ben for the holidays this year.
I'm not proving anything. Okay, I'm done listening to you. If I hadn't let you talk me into going to the airport in the first place, I never would've put my fist through the wall!
Although if we're gonna do that, we should probably call me "Daddy" too.
I'll...
Break!!
This place is really beautiful!
I just feel like someone reached down my throat, grabbed my small intestine, pulled it out of my mouth and tied it around my neck...
This is insane, I'm not gonna make love to you just so that you'll go into labor.
May 12th?
Oh my God!
Fine, we'll call the next one Ella.
...and these come in the shapes of your favourite Christmas characters, Santa, Rudolph, and Baby Jesus.
C'mon Rachel.
It used to be. Now she doesn't really have a face. Smokin' body though.
Yeah and we'd want to make sure Emma has someone like Monica who is more uh. uh discliplinarin.. someone who can be firm and strict.
Just a sandwich. Turkey, a little mustard...
What's wrong with this year?
Emily!
There it is.
Don't yell at me okay, this is the most I've seen you all week.
Are you serious?
Will you make the mashed potatoes with the lumps?
I did give up a career in basketball to become a paleontologist!
No, not this time. So... what'd you have?
Oh well, it sounds to me like your family is ready to uh, rediscover its Scottish roots.
It's no surprise that your winning, 'cause you got to pick first, so you got the better team.
Hey.
Hey, I'm not one to kiss and tell, but I'm also not one to have sex and shut up. We totally did it!
She hates Pottery Barn?!!
Oww!
Oh, so-so you talked to her. Did she, did she sound mad?
No, it's okay. Some-some kid asked me to pick it up for him, but I don't...
Just a smidge.
What, oh my God. What did you do?
Hootie and the--oh my. I, I can catch them on the radio.
Err, right.
Maybe not.
Okay, I think I might know why my parents don't like you.
Hi.
Touched. Used. Sat on. Sleep on.
I can't believe you guys aren't going to be able to get married today.
Okay, 'you' can't, or you can't? Okay, that's my finger. That's, that's my knee. Still doing the play. Aaah!
You know what, you can go, I just have to fill out some forms.
Yeah, yeah. It wasn't every morning.
Well, looks like it's just the two of us tonight, huh old buddy?
Guys? There's a somebody I'd like you to meet.
Oh Mon, I laughed so hard...
Perfect. Perfect. So now everybody's getting kissed but me.
Well, Ben would be there.
Oh great! Hey-hey Joey, do you want to check out pictures of me and Mona ice skating?
Hey, it's my list.
I think it's insane.
Thanks!
Well, they painted over the word 'Sapien' for one thing, then they rearranged the figures, let's just leave it at that.
Hi.
Okay, you ready?
Hey uh Mon, I saw the Porsche parked out front, can I get the keys? Thought I'd take that bad boy out for a little spin.
Come on Rach, you can't even eat alone in a restaurant.
The actress!
Atta boy.
...Yeah.
I'm sorry your husband cheated on you.
It was...This disagreement over... My god. You...you look beautiful.
It'll be okay Joe.
Ohh, I don't think so.
Hi.
Well, I do! Why don't we go back to my place, light a couple of candles, break open a box of Cinnamon Fruit Toasties, uh...
Well, if what's in the bottle is actually 30. I mean sometimes you get 30, sometimes it's-it's get 4, and I swear to God more often than not it's just milk.
Hey! We totally forgot about lunch!
I'm sorry. Dr. Green, Mona. Mona, Dr. Green.
Hey, is Chandler here? We talked about catching a movie.
yes, yes I did. and I will also say what I'm about to say Vis-a-vis the following Phoebe has never had a serious relationship since her. super-serious relationship with. Vicrum.
I prefer not to answer that right now, I'm still carrying a little holiday weight.
Y'know I would it's just painful.
Uh-huh, Carol, so were we. All right, just-just imagine for a moment, Susan meets someone and-and they really hit it off. Y'know? Say-say they're coming back from the theatre, and they-they stop at a pub for a couple of drinks, they're laughing, y'know, someone innocently touches someone else... There's electricity, it's new. It's exciting. Are you telling me there isn't even the slightest possibility of something happening?
She wants me to take responsibility for everything that went wrong in our relationship. I mean she goes on for five pages about, about how I was unfaithful to her! WE WERE ON A BREAK!!!!!
Tell me about it.
If she is where you are then uh...then my feeling weird about it shouldn't stand in the way.
Ok, well, if you do take him out for his walk, you might wanna bring his hat, and there's extra milk in the fridge, and there's extra diapers in the bag.
What?
I'll tell you what Mon, I'll give you the first box for free.
My best friend and my sister! I cannot believe this. You guys probably wanna get some hugs in too, huh? Big news!
No!
What's going on?
Well, see? So, maybe it wasn't such a bad idea, y'know, me kissing your mom, uh? Huh? But.. we don't have to go down that road.
Well, how was the date?
Come on! Forty-five minutes! Forty-five minutes the man talked about strappy backed dresses.
Hey, you're a doctor of gums. That's the smallest body part you can major in. It's like day one, floss. Day two, here's your diploma.
So, eh. I made out with Adrienne and you made out with Missy. Well I guess we're even.
We have got to start locking that door!
No. We should all have dinner. Yes, we'll do it tomorrow night. I'll cook!!
MY SANDWICH!!!!!!
Is this about Mark?
A lesson in the importance of unagi.
Cat.
Well, I was with Carol for like eight years and I lost her. And now if it's possible I think I love you even more. So, it's hard for me to believe that I'm not gonna, well that someone else is not going to take you away.
Wait a minute, the house was built on radioactive waste, and an ancient Indian burial ground? That would never happen.
Uh, hello, the buzzer buzzed. It doesn't count.
Oh my God.
Well that I can believe.
No! No! No! No-no-no-no.
Y'know what I didn't wear this suit for a year because you hated it. Well, guess what? You're not my girlfriend anymore so...
That uh, that was pretty funny. Wasn't it?
Okay, okay, fine, you're right. Let's ah, let's take a break, let's cool off, okay, let's get some frozen yogart, or something..
Maybe I'll take her to that new French restaurant down the street...
Hey.
Oh my God, what happened?
What?
Wait a minute... when you guys walked into the Met, did you go to the right?
What?! I wh-, what's wrong?
Hey-Ooh! What's-what's that, dinner stuff? You making dinner?
There's nothing you can say. That was the most humiliating thing that ever happened to me.
Ok.
Woah. Huh. You know about my, I mean, you know I had... you know?
Umm, no.
Come on! The time we were all waiting in line for Dances With Wolves and that one guy cut in line in front of us and I just lost it?! Screamed at him! Turned all red! Red Ross!!
Five.
Ohh.
Oh my God! Of course, of course. Umm, would you please excuse me for a moment? Umm, do you know each other's hometowns? Why don't you... Wh-what's going on?
Okay, okay, we were on the ride along with Gary, right?
Not at all! I love this guy. Hey, I was so psyched to hear you're back with my sister!
Why? What was wrong with her?
Just showing you my run-of-the-mill-slice-it-right-off third nipple.
Thanks. And-and hey Joe?
It's been an hour and not one of my classmates has shown up! I tell you, when I actually die some people are gonna get seriously haunted!
Your joke? Well, I think 'the Hef' would disagree, which is why he sent me a check for one hundred ah-dollars.
I was gonna make us some dinner but all I found in your dad's fridge was bacon and heavy cream. I think we solved the mystery of the heart attack.
I'd love to!
To wear in front of people?
Oh! I thought you guys got married in uh, January?
No anchovies.
Phoebe, you were sure Ben was gonna be a girl.
Good.
What?
That was the only way I could get him to stop typing!
Can I ask you something? Have you ever had a guy have a crush on you?
Yeah.
Too easy? Too...The process of every living thing on this planet evolving over millions of years from single-celled organisms, too easy?
All right, bye!
Hey, you gotta get Mom on the phone. Call Mom! Call Mom!
Yeah that-that, doesn't look right.
Well I guess you can start by drivin a cab on Another World.
Okay, Pheebs: Right hand blue. Good.
Oh my God!
It doesn't matter! It's my principles! We're talking about my principles!
It was ridiculous. Ya know, these guys, they were bullies, actual bullies, ya know. We're grown ups, this kinda stuff isn't supposed to happen anymore.
What?!
Joey.
No, no, that's not where I was going. Er, if you get in the... way, of us becoming a thing, then I would be, well, very sad.
Look, you guys I just wanna say, I really, really appreciate you spending this time with me. It's been a pretty hard time right now, so I just wanna say thanks.
Joey, come on now, for me! Please, just-just try to focus your sexual energy on someone else.
Hey, hey, I'm your daddy. I'm the one without any breasts.
I have an oily T-zone!
OK, what's the longest you've been in the relationship before ha, have, having the sex?
Namaste.
Ok, sweetheart, I'll call you later tonight. Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, hey, hey, you're not really gonna go through with this, are you?
Yeah.
All right, bad ankle, got it!
Let go! Let go!
I, I don't know, it's got all this stuff about wind and trees and there's some kind of sacred pool in it. I mean, I don't really get it but she's, she's pretty upset about it.
Yes, yes of course, what-what would this be regarding?
You sure?
No. No.
The bathroom?
Alright, that's it. I've had enough of this, alright. Gunther, these guys are trying to take our seat.
Because I am bored...Out of my mind. I've already been to the bank, post office, and the dry cleaners.
Oh no, I have plans with Elizabeth.
That's easy for you to say, you found one already.
Monica? Monica, Monica, Monica, Monica..?
Hey! All that stuff you said about true love, you were right, I mean, we did learn a lot from Mom and Dad! And that picture of Chi-Chi with her mischievous grin. And what you said about Nana. Ohh, yeah she really would've wanted to be there. And you know what? I think she was.
Are you kidding? Okay, look. I-I studied evolution. Remember, evolution? Monkey into man? Plus, I'm a doctor, and I had a monkey. I'm Doctor Monkey!
Oh, it's-it's Marcel. He keeps shutting me out, y'know? He's walking around all the time dragging his hands...
Well, not playing raquetball!
Look, if you'd had two failed marriages, you'd understand!
Let's show 'em.
Yeah, not as much as you used to love to play uncooked batter eater.
I was having a little chat with ah, Bonnie, and ah, guess what, she-she happened to bring up y'know, who was behind the um, whole head shaving idea, and now, who was it? Oh, that's right, that's right, it was you!
Oh God, here we go!
Oh, no, Mom, it's just Monica this year.
You're wrong.
C'mon.
Hey! Hey! Come on! You can! I know you can do this! Let's go!
No!! No!! I wanna stay. I wanna talk about this.
Look, I didn't recognize it without that inflatable sheep.
Okay. Sometimes I feel...
Yeah, so far nothing stupid.
Forget it, she's destroying it.
That was so cool man, the way you leaned on that guy.
So, do we really have to ask who's going up on the platform next?
And; people thinking it's huge has led Monica to believe that we are stealing her thunder. Which we are not!
Yes, I do have a laundry room in my building, um, but there's a.... rat problem. Apparently they're attracted to the dryer sheets, and they're goin' in fine, but they're comin' out all.... fluffy. Anyway, say, sevenish?
Hey-hey, I thought she told you to follow the recipe exactly!
Oh God. Y'know, botanists are such geeks.
What's wrong?
Soon he'll be able to call you, that lady he knew who got fired.
I'm-I'm sure that's not true.
Okay, we could still make dinner if we skipped the appetisers and asked for our check right away.
It's awful I know, I mean, I feel terrible but I have to do this if I want my marriage to work. And I do, I have to make this marriage work. I have too. But the good thing is we can still see each other until she gets here.
I just-I-I can't believe she's-she's dating?!
Okay. So well I'll umm, I'll have her home by midnight.
Phoebe, why is your bag moving?
I know and I was going to, but I thought it was better that you heard it from Rachel's father. Look I...I made a mistake, but it's only because I really, really like you. Really!
I made her favorite, tuna salad with pickles.
No no, that's me.
You know what, if you wanna look for a house, that's okay.
What's going on?
You know, if I didn't already have a job, I think, I would have been really good in advertising.
What?
Oh my God!
Yeah. Everything but, the little blue one.
How 'bout instead you, go get changed! You, give him back his underwear! I'm gonna go get a cab, and I want everyone down stairs in two minutes! Monica!
So, what do you want to do tonight? There's a Ukrainian film at the Angelica that's supposed to be very powerful. Interested?
Hey!
That's it, your doing great.
So is everybody here? I got here a little early myself. Let us begin. Now, the hydrosaurids have been unearthed in two main locations. Here. Here. Now as for the hydrosaurs...
...and I really think it should be me.
Yes let's. Y'know what? Uh, it's-it's not important. What is important is that, is that we're having a baby. And it's not-Doesn't matter who came on to who.
God no!
Oh my God, I love you.
Damn it. It's never off the table.
Oh, that'd be great! Okay, but if you do, make sure it seems like you're there to see him, okay, and you're not like doing it as a favour to me.
But that's not enough. So... So...here's a key to my apartment.
Well, ahem... you know, by the time we'd finished with all the dirty talk, it was kinda late... and we were both kind of exhausted, so uh...
Well, I'm sorry, but ah, look if you're not working with him anymore, why do you have to still do stuff with him?
Because it's weird!
What. Oh no, you just rolled over the juice box.
Rach, we gotta go.
How could you not get it? You were Santa last year.
Ohh! Ew!
Please.
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. We're not 13 anymore.
I chose those, I'm a paleontologist.
I'm in.
Do not rush me!!
Well, excuse her for knowing what she wants to do with her life!
She's fine. She doesn't know you're gone. And she doesn't have to know, okay? Now come on, we're going home.
Yeah.
... and while there are certainly vast differences between these Mesozoic fossiles and the example of Homo erectus...
I don't know! I guess I just can't believe any of this is happening.
Okay. Okay. Umm hi, this is Rachel Green. I'm Ross Geller. We-we called from the car.
You bug me.
Goodnight.
Yeah, maybe.
Oh.. you don't get it!
Well, we should probably get going.
One more fight!
What are you saying?
Thank you!
Wh-what's up?
I really wish that you wouldn't.
Two seconds...
Yeah but Phoebs, what about the end?
I'm up for tenure.
Now, if you wanna try to make some of it back, I'd be glad to play you for it. But I should warn you, I am very good at Cups.
Ok.
Oh.
Oh, guys, this is fun, isn't it? You know? Just the four of us. Just hangin'.
What? Why? What's wrong?
Oh yeah it will! Come on, up! Up-up-up! Up! Yes! Here we go! Pivot! Pivot! Piv-ot! Piv-et!! Piv-ett!!! Piv-et!
What are you kidding? It's Batman's tux!!
I know what you mean, I've always wondered how different my life would be if-if I'd never gotten divorced.
Okay, that's it. WE ARE SEEING OTHER PEOPLE!
I- I- I ca- I can't believe this. I mean, all I asked you to do was keep him in the apartment.
Hey, we can rescedule for Saturday.
There you go. You put on a tuxedo! Now that wasn't so scary, was it?
You know, I'm just not uhm... that comfortable with a guy who's as sensitive as you.
Right. So is it gonna be like 'I'm abandoning you while your upset.'
Happy birthday!!!
Look, check this out. Is it a coffee table, is it a panther? There's no need to decide.
Yeah-yeah, except Apollo 8 didn't actually land on the moon. But you-you-you could write that umm, your love lets me orbit the moon twice and return safely.

Hey! Hi!
Y'know, the kind of fun, you and Susan had when we were married.
Take from me, as the groom all you have to do is show up and try to say the right name.
I just wanted to tell you something before you heard it from someone else and I hope this isn't too weird, but uh, I had uh, a thing with Janice. What you're-you're not mad?
Oh thank you.
Yeah, sure.
Well, uh, does she like you?
Ok.
Uh, middle balcony.
Please take your time, it's an important decision. Not like, say, I know! deciding to marry someone, this is about a muffin.
Ok... now... now we're just holding hands!
Yeah.
No no, you're uh, you're my lobster. See um, lobsters, uhh, in the tank when, when they're old, uhh, they get with, uhh, they walk around holding the claws. In the tank, ya know, with, with the holding and. . . Uhh, Phoebs you wanna help me out with the, the whole lobster thing?
Hey Pheebs, what 'cha reading? Pheebs? Hello? Phoebe? Phoe-Phoebe! Come on!
Rachel! Rachel Green!
What's uh, what's going on? Do you not, do you not like Katie?
I'm sorry, Chandler but this, this is really important to me.
Well, there's this, uh, paleontology conference in L.A. so I figured I'd go and then drive down to the zoo and surprise Marcel.
It's my joke.
Yeah, I was but uh, she was a little busy with a water balloon fight.
No!
We're just gonna be friends.
Oh my God!
Yeah? Hop on. Is the pretty lady looking?
Hey you guys!
Gunther. Hey-hey! Why don't we put them on? Y'know get a picture of Batman and James Bond together.
I know, but ahhhhhh!! I really wanna go up there and finish that kiss!
I thought you were my best friend, this is my sister! My best friend and my sister! I-I cannot believe this!
Wow! We are pretty good at this! Hey! We totally forgot about lunch!
It's alright, it's no big deal.
I just-y'know-I-I just have one-Rachel?!
Oh, I know.
Oh umm, well uh, maybe-maybe later. Right now, I'm about to dance with this lady.
They published my paper.
Noo!
It's actually kinda interesting to find out what people are doing... remember Andrea Rich?
What's the matter? You okay?
What? What?! You were begging me to kiss you! You-you-you were sending me signals all over the place!
Look Phoebe, I'm sorry it's just...
If the place you are referring too is being in love, then she is in the same place as me because I am not in that place!
Yes! Yes! Yes!!
What? Oh yeah, yeah I think so. Why am I invited to this again?
That's so Janine, you-you-you know what, do you know we're doing right now? You and I, we're interfacing.
That's all I'm askin'.
'Kay, wait a minute, are you sure she didn't say "When are you gonna grow up and realise I am your mom?"
Alright.
A little? Your place looks like page 72 of the catalogue. Oh look at that! The ornamental bird cage! Large!
Remember? You-you were eating pizza.
Yeah. Yeah. Yes, this place is beautiful. Emily's parents got married here.
Right.
Marcel? Marcel? Okay, where is he? Where is he? Marcel? Marcel?
Oh. Oh-oh.
Yeah, oh hey, you are right on time.
How does this look?
Yes!! I knew it!! Bye-bye! So long! Later!
Turn.
Why?
Actually it's the movie theatre that has the time schedule. So you don't miss the beginning.
I've never walked down the aisle knowing it can't end in divorce.
Nice shades.
You're right, you're right, it is...So you gonna invite us all to the big opening?
You made it!
...run it all over your body until you're... trembling with... with...
You promised you wouldn't say anything.
Rach? You wanna come?
Well we did it, we're here. We are standing our ground. How long does a cup of coffee take?
My apothecary table!!!
I guess if everybody else is... Closing credits.
Were you the ones called the cops?!
It was, it was okay.
Ooh... so sad... Still, it can't be easy for you to leave Harvard? Especially after working alongside a Nobel Prize winner like Albert Wintermeyer?
Really?
Look, I-I don't want to miss anymore baby stuff. So...Here. Here's my new pager number, okay? Anytime anything pregnancy related happens use it! I'll be there! Okay? I don't care if it's three in the morning and all you want is ice cream.
That's crap!! Sister Brown Bird. Good going.
Hey!
What? Where?
You bet. In the U.S., China, Africa, all over.
My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I'm not, I can't do-
I love you.
Okay, okay, awkward question. The hospital knows you took two, right?
Well, okay, what-what did she say?
Oh yeah, yeah, sure. Absolutely.
I think that would be best.
Honey, I love you too.
Yeah, but still, cheap shot!
Yeah, I know, I uh, I tried them on.
Umm. Umm, I'm-I'm just gonna-
Fine. I just need to know that you're not gonna tell your sister.
No, no I don't want to do anything to you. All right? I just want to tell you that I'm not mad at you and...and that I certainly do not hate you. I just, I just came here to say that.
You really thought "Science Boy" was worth saving!
Wait a minute! Were you on a poster for gonorrhea?
No, no don't! Stop cleansing my aura! No, just leave my aura alone, okay?
Okay. This stuff?
No wait, look. Look! I'm sorry, it's just I've never even met Howard. I-I mean I don't know Howard.
I can't believe this! I shouldn't be the one making her throw up!
You weren't there! Okay, maybe this is something that I-I'm supposed to seize! Y'know?
Just-just so you know I was a freshman and she was a senior. So it wasn't as bad as-as...
What?!
Alright, ok, let's do it. Uhm, I know we start by discussing the shortcomings of carbon dating... uhm, and then, then I move on to what is clearly the defining moment of the Mesozoic era, the breakup of Pangea, hello! And then, there's the... eh... there's the overview of the Triassic.
Hey, let's not do this!
Look who I found standing outside of the Szechwan Dragon staring at a parking meter.
What? No, that's illegal. I'm gonna have the labor department down her so fast they won't even...
Well yeah, I think we should get married.
Oh no, you-you don't understand. Ugh, this is so silly. Umm, this is all because of a sandwich.
No, Rach!
Did you say something?
Ooooohhhh.
Hey. How did, uh, how'd it go today?
I... I don't know..
May I come in?
Okay, it's not, it's not.
Okay. So we're, we're good?
No, I barely even got to three Mississippi.
Oh my God, we did it!
We had such a great time! She's-she's incredible! I thought the-the age difference might be a problem, but it wasn't. It wasn't at all. Elizabeth is very mature for her age. A concept lost on some people!
Hey, how can it not be me?!HeyHey!
Hey, what's wrong?
Stupid balls are in the way.
Ah-ha, nowhere to run!
Uh, everyone, this is Chandler! My roommate and lead singer of our band!
Not so good.
Hey, how'd the date go with Mr. Millionaire?
No, no-no, Ross Geller.
And so now you guys are gonna be married?
Fighting?!
Yes. I'm... I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
Oh, oh, that's, that's, that's nice.
Oh, I will.
Yeah, we thought we had a monkey, but we-we didn't.
I'm never gonna find love again.
What?
That's my favorite shirt! Okay? I love that shirt!
What?! The guys against the girls? See, that's ridiculous Monica, because I'm only down by three touchdowns.
No, no, no, no! Don't tell me! I don't want to know!
Same difference.
Well then we'll-we'll see you the day after tomorrow. Mom?! Dad?! What-what...what you guys doing here?!
Okay. You know that I-I have to go.
If it does? Then you're an amazing friend of mine.
This is unbelievable. I - I have never been so insulted in my life. Now, if you'll wrap up my free crab cakes, I'll be on my way.
What? What? What?!
Ok, ok, ok, ok, here goes. You know, I, you know, can't do this. Uh, this is too weird. I feel stupid.
Phoebe, what happened?
Hello. Oh hi, are you on your way ove-. Oh. No, no, I, I understand, I mean a monkey's gotta work. No it, it's no big deal, it' not like I uh, had anything special planned. Yeah OK, OK. OK, OK, bye.
Y'know what? Actually I'm kinda glad they're leaving 'cause uh, I need to talk to you about something.
I've got to say; I know I divorce a lot of women, never thought I would be divorcing you.
Are you into crafts at all?
Mine.
Well, not really. I mean technically it's-it's not against the rules or anything, but it is frowned upon. Especially by that professor we ran into last night, Judgey von Holierthanthou.
Ok! See? Scared of swings, I bet you feel pretty silly Ow!
Honey, just relax, it's gonna be fine. Hey, umm,. why don't I come down there and I'll take you out to lunch?
This is my wedding.
And, and uh, you-you remember my friend Chandler.
Nah, I don't know if I should. I don't wanna be drunk when I go home alone.
You what? Wh what were you doing seeing her boobies?
Keep dancing.
You think?
No, but, your-your mad.
But R-R-Rachel-Rachel?!
Uh Joey...
Well we just wanted to stop by and uh, say goodnight.
You got it.
That was 14 hours ago.
No! No we don't!
Thread!
No, no, no. That's impossible. It doesn't leave for another 20 minutes.
Well, OK, it's for a boy. Well, I know it's a little out there, but...Darwin.
It was my first time.
Ok, ok! I'm gonna go hide! Oh, this is so exciting, my first mourner!
Oh, oh, you're... uh... you're, oh you're the date.
Oh, I uh, just came by to pick up my skull. Well, not mine, but...Susan: Come in.
Phoebe! Wow! No, no, no!
2:17.
Emily, hi! Uh, how-how was you flight?
Happy Thanksgiving!
No.
OK, ahem, hey, does anybody know a good place if you're not dating a puma?
Yes. Yes. Yes.
I don't think so.
What, what is it?
No no no, she gets a credit, hey, I'm in there too.
I gave them to Joey.
Look, we've been together. Okay? And then apart, and then together, and then apart, and now we have a baby. It's just if-if we got together again and it didn't work out...I could never do that to Emma. I mean she-she thinking everything- Oh that's...now me. What do they put something in the water in this place? Since Rachel and I we're doing really, we're doing really well right now.
Well, it turns out that she is going to Daytona for spring break woo-hoo. That means, that means wet T-shirt contests, guys doing shots off of girl's bodies, waking up next to people you don't even know...
Fun? Where was the fun? Tell me specifically, which part was the fun part? Where's my puck?
Well, then, maybe it's time we all moved on.
Really?
Mon?
Y'know, I think they have those at that British pub near the trade center.
Uhh, yeah it would! Let's do it!
Right?
What?!
Okay, it must just be me then.
Glad I could help man.
It's all right.
Good evening officer.
Ok! So let's move on to the Renaissance?
Right?
Oh Rach that's great. That's great.
Hey. Oh, oh, how'd it go?
Can we, can we just forget this ever happened?
Oh, I'll-I'll come hug you.
Nope! Something else.
Well, this is what happens when people live on the edge!
I don't, I don't think we've meet. I-I'm Ross.
Oh-oh yeah, you-you came up to me and asked if I could do you a favor, and my Uncle Murray came up to you and handed you a check. And then you said, "Why do they call it a check? Why not a Yugoslavian?" Yeah, then you did that.
Okay, there's this guy, Warren, from the museum and he's going on a dig for like two years and he's got this great place he needs to sublet. So uh, you interested?
Wha, uhh, what?
Yeah, okay, Scott!
It's possible, they have really sharp edges.
Hey... there's sensitive... and there is too sensitive.
Oh, who? Me?
No thanks. I'm 29.
Yeah, she's fired.
Hey!
Uh okay, well there's-there's wine in the kitchen.
No, but Chandler, hello... Aren't you scared of dogs?
See?
Maybe it's a universal thing?
No. No, I gotta go home sometime.
Umm, uh, I was just telling the guys...
Sweep, sweep....
Good.
I got it!
Did you tell him about my thquirt gun idea?
Hi!
Oh y'know what, girls don't like it when I start talking about science.
I dont know whether hes testing me, or just acting out, but my monkey is out of control. But, he keeps erasing the messages on my machine, "supposedly" by accident.
Joey, you shouldn't lie on your resume.
Oh my god.
He's not?
Why? Did you write it?
Y'know, it's interesting! Most people think that's made with seawater, when in fact-
Oh, thank you, thanks. So uh, how was your night last night?
Ahh, I-I did leave the gel on a little longer then it said to.
What? What? What?! You guys knew? You all knew and you didn't tell me?!!
Yeah-No-but-but-but-but! We're just gonna go home and take a shower. Now, that's not scary right?
Hey! Are you ready yet?
Let's give it a shot.
I'm fine! Hey, I'm great! I'm just.. I'm just proud of us. There's no weirdness, no tension.
I would!
Yeah! Yeah! Rachel picked it out for me. She told me to trust her and you know what? I'm glad I did! I turned quite a few heads on my way over here.
It's just, it's, it's me. You, you know I've only been with one woman my whole life and she turned out to be a lesbian. So now I've got myself all psyched out, you know, and it's become, like this, this thing and I. . . Well, you just must think I'm weird.
Hey hey, can I help?
Here, check it out. It's the first one, too.
No need to point, she knows who Ross is.
Look, you'll get there. You're an amazing chef.
Yeah, uh, uh, ok, there's this great rare bookstore on Madison Avenue. You know what? She loves architecture, you know what you should do? You should take a walk down fifth to the Saint Patrick's Cathedral and there there's this great little pastry shop that she'd love.
Always a great way to get in a man's pants.
Joey, it's Ross! I need some help!
Let me finish, okay? She started kissing me and-and I didn't stop it. I guess I-I just wasn't thinking...
Is Rachel here? I gotta talk to her.
Ready sweety?
Wow. I'm sorry, when I was a kid I lost a bike to that.
She... she only dates geniuses and Nobel Prize winners. Oh my God, at the chinese restaurant earlier today, I put chopsticks in my mouth and pretented to be a woolly mammoth.
That's what?!
And it's a wedding! It'd be weird if I'm not in it...
Kind of inappropriate, don't you think?
And on your anniversary, for shame!
I just wanna thank you for being there for me today. And I'm sorry I,I almost broke your hand.
Well, we-we haven't said that to each other yet, but I guess its okay to say it to other people.
No, no, Dad, I was just wondering.
Oooooh.
Rachel, come on. Give us a chance.
What? She's gonna eat all those cookies?
You never cooked since 1996.
Why-why can't you take a couple of days off?
Okay.
Oh, what are you going to do, follow me down there?
Yeah that's the same.
Sorry, I'm kinda keeping this one on the Q.T.
What are you talking about? You get sixty responses just for coming out of the closet! I didn't get one response! And I'm dead!
In this life, Phoebe.
Cool.
Joey, what did you think a nubbin was?
I know, I know. Everybody, there's someone I'd like you to meet. Yeah. This is Ben. Ben, this is everybody.
Yeah... I guess. I don'tI don't know. Alright, just... just give her this for me, OK?
Wow! We are pretty good at this!
No touch! No touch!
PUSH! PUSH! PUSH!
Hey, what have you guys been up to?
Okay, but just the jacket. Double-oh and seven are not gettin' in there.
Hey you.
You had no right to tell me you ever had feelings for me.
Hold on.
Great!
You've tasted it? You've tasted it.
Dude, we were good!
That's nice... now, was that before or after you told him to stop calling, stop sending you flowers and to generally leave you alone, hmm?
Okay, it's not a contest.
Oh, that's me.
I promise you she's safe! No watch how much she loves this.
Of course I was mad! I told you I-I hate this stuff! Okay? It-it's not funny!
And uh, Rachel.
Pride.
Well, he's finally alseep. About that ah, bump on his head?
I played bad on purpose guys.
Hey, what do you say we celebrate? Champagne?
Sure what kind?
Okay.
Argh!
Oh, that. Umm, she took it really well.
My friend Bethel rescued him from some lab.
Yeah.
Right.
I-I uh, I got tricked into all those things!
This is Ross?
Oh man.
Uhh, those are tacos.
Look, you guys, you guys should go. No, I'm, you, you planned this all out, and I don't want to ruin it, so you guys should just go.
Woah. Woah... Woah.
I got mugged. And they stole my pocket.
Well obviously only one of us can keep dating her.
Oh, I've gotten into the habit of calling Rachel "Mommy" when we're around Emma. Which I now realize we are not ...
Alright.
That's excellent.
Come on Pheebs, it's not that bad! Y'know most people would be excited if they didn't have to work for a couple of weeks.
Oh... Ohh... I'd love to but I really have to grade these papers.
Oh, that's OK. I'm sure there are tons of other beautiful paleontologists out there.
What? What?
Oh, hey hey hey, ho ho ho, hello, guy who doesn't want to know, standing right here!
Oh my God!
Who?
Huh? So? We have a deal?
All right, I see what you guys are saying. I'll uh, I'll go downstairs and fill out an application.
Hey! How long until Pete's fight?
Hey you guys.
Oh God you're right.
I just, I don't understand, I mean, how-how can she do this? Y'know, what, am I, am I like a complete idiot for thinking that she'd actually show up?
Well, that makes sense.
Well, hello Rachel!
Ohhhh...
Oh, I'm threatened by you?
You know what? I don't need a tie. I mean, it's better, open collar. You know, it's more casual.
Uh-oh, saved by the bell. Hello?
Yeah.
Good.
Yes-yes-yes! But, I-I do not love her.
I did.
Thank you.
I know!
How about you?
What? Okay, okay, okay, okay.
Dude.
No! I talked to Joey on the set, he hasn't heard from him. I-I-I talked to Chandler's parents again!
I mean, uhm... you know when I was growing up he was kind of a tough guy... You know a-a-and as a kid I wasn't the athlete I am now.
Bye guys.
Yeah, maybe. I do have my whole career in front of me. I mean, I can still win a Nobel prize. Although the last two papers I've written were widely discredited.
It's a big deal to me. This is great, Monica. I really appreciate this.
Oh-oh, Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger.
Rach, she's not going to remember this.
I had a dream last night where I was playing football with my kid.
People are doing it in front of my book!
I've got to say you guys, that's an incredible gesture!
Umm, would you like to dance?
Hey! What do you guys think about this. "Ross: The Divorce-Force".
Ok, ok. I'm gonna come out to Long Island with you, I mean, you can't be alone right now.
Are you sure?
Yeah, it's, it's, it's cute. Why, why, why does he have it, again?
Come on, I'm your older brother, ask me!
Hey uh, I brought you some lunch.
Fine, I'm mentally unstable.
Yay!
What can I do, she doesn't listen to me about renter's insurance either.
All right! You go get him! Let's go!
I was thinkin' about it.
Hey! Okay! I got my passport, fresh socks, and a snake bite kit!
I didn't say we were brothers.
Eh, no problem.
You wanna watch Laverne y Shirley?
OK. I'm in my apartment...
Hey.
But having a dove place the ring on your finger would've been no problem?
Here you go.
No. No, it's just 'cause, uh, I kinda wanted to go out with her too, so I told her, actually, you were seeing Bernie Spellman... who also liked her, so...
Wow! Great! Wait, dad who-who's cigarettes are these?
..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he-
Yeeeeeep... Yep-yep-yep-yep-yep. I remember when she took out on her dad's boat she wouldn't let me help at all.
What?
Hey, I thought I'd end up kissing Charlie too ok? But SURPRISE!
people so why you all dressed up.
Ok. B - O - S ...
I know. I know. But, can we please try it again? Huh? I mean, you were so close Phoebe!
Oh, whatever.
What?
Come on, I think this is a good thing. I don't think Mom would've hired you if she didn't think you were good at what you do.
All right. Uhh, international.
Now umm, remember I'm still learning.
I mean, why not! I mean, I mean why not?!
Dude, I need to talk to you a sec.
What? What? Was that a joke? 'Cause it's mean.
Oh. How do you uh, ya know, keep it so neat?
Uh Phoebe, can I see you for a second?
Hey, I'm not going to rush into anything!
Uh Rach...
Duh, you think?
Oh.
No, I mean it. You are so loyal man, and selfless, and generous...
Why? What?
Well ah, actually...
All right that's, that's it!! Get off her!
I guess it all started when Rachel got this new job.
I'm starving!
Oh come on, we just had this huge fight, all right, don't I have to wait a while?
Yeah! And! And, it was the easiest 400 bucks I've ever made.
What?
Hey!
No-no-no! Only if I promise never to see Rachel again.
Oh, Rach...oh..."gleba" is not a word.
Oh, Monica, I figured I'd come by tomorrow morning and pick up Fluffy's old cat toy, OK?
Hi! What are you, what are you doing here?
Let me ask you something, at your school was there a like uh a place on campus where students went to uh, fool around.
Okay, look, he's not gonna hurt them, right?
Hiii.
Joey, NO!
Okay, first of all, I don't play with cheaters, and second of all, you know I had swollen glands!!
What's - what's going on?
Look, I-I know how miserable you are, I wish there was something I can do. I mean I wish I were a seahorse. Because with seahorses it's the male, they carry the babies. And then also umm, I'd be far away in the sea.
Oh, is that funny?! Oh, you-you find that funny?! Well maybe Chandler should know some of your secrets too!
We're rehearsing a Greek play.
Hey, I just realized we kinda let some stuff up in the air...
She does want to.
Oh my god...
Alright, we'll just, uh, see when you get here. Bye. Huh, that was my mom, she's stuck in terrible traffic.
Look, they must be stopped!
Y'know what would cheer you up?
Phoebe, I told her you already knew.
We have 8:00 reservations at Grammercy Bistero.
Yeah, but it didn't fit. Well, luckily there's a store here that has one left in her size, but I'm the groom, I'm not supposed to see the dress...
Okay. Hut! Hike!
Uh, clearly.
I know. I know.
Oh great. So all I need to do is get some new skin. Thank you.
Hmm.
Chandler, can I just say something? I-I know you're still mad at me, I just wanna say that there were two people there that night. Okay? Two sets of lips.
Yeah?
Why does anyone have to be naked?
Right.
Ohh!
Thanks for the help, problem solved.
Oh OK. Well then why don't you, uhh, why don't you borrow it from mom and dad? You feel guilty and tense around them already. You might as well make some money off of them.
You can't do that!
Dad that won't matter to her. Look, all my stuff is safe and dry and all her is-is, is growing new stuff! See, this is exactly the kind of thing that makes her think you guys love me more than you love her.
Know what-If somebody doesn't tell me what's going on right now...
Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs!
Look guys, when I'm with her it's-it's-it's like she brings this-this-this great side out of me. I mean I-I-I love her, y'know?
Hey Chandler, what are you doing tonight?
Ah y'know, this building is on my paper route so I...
What? I'm kidding. You know I'd never let him touch the Porsche.
Oh, now, don't listen to him, Pheebs, I think it's endearing.
Goodnight.
I'll be right down.
So if you take this job you'll be moving to Paris?
Here they come, here they come. Oh-ho, if she kisses him goodnight, I'm gonna kill myself, I swear. I can't, I can't watch this. Come on, date over! Date over! Uh-oh, here we go, she's going in.
.....Hi.
Yes, yes it is. In prison!
Huh.
I've been back and forth.
Not at the concert.
It's winter, they are fewer people on the street.
Besides, I-I think I figured out a much faster route, I'm sure I can make it this time. I just...I just can't be afraid to get a little bit...hit by cars.
Science...? Academia...? Being a good father...?
Look, I'm sorry.
Okay, look, we have nineteen minutes. Okay, Chandler, I want you to go and change! Okay. And then, when you come back, Joey will go change, and he'll have vacated the chair. Okay. Okay.
Yes, very nice Rachel.
Hi.
All right!!
Plus tip, divided by six. Ok, everyone owes 28 bucks.
I'm having a baby in here! Ok, everyone stand back. Ow.
The kid...? Excuse me, uh, that's, that's my puck.
Yeah, okay.
Well, why don't you correct him?
I think we do. Why don't we go inside? Look uh, I know why you're here.
Ohh, I gotta go to the flower store! Check it out, no one will tell me where Emily is, so I'm gonna send 72 long-stem, red roses to Emily's parent's house, one for each day that I've known and loved her. That oughta get her talking to me again.
What the hell are doing?!!
When you thought Joey proposed did...did you say yes?
Do them!!
Look, I was nervous! You guys had me all worried I was going to be boring! I got up there and they were all like staring at me. I opened my mouth and this British accent just came out.
Sorry.
Ah I had a little thing with Joey, if you think this is bad you should see him.
Because I folded it up and put in my pants pocket. Do you...do you not look there?
Hi.
Alright, I panicked, alright? She took me by surprise. You know, but it wasn't a total loss. I mean, we ended up cuddling.
Oh, you've tasted it.
Yay! Seriously, our sex life... I was thinking, maybe I don't know, we could try some-some new things. Y'know? For fun?
Thank you guys-guys-guys...
I thought you were my best friend, this is my sister! My best friend and my sister! I-I cannot believe this!
No, no, it's okay. Really. They're plenty of people who just see their sisters at Thanksgiving and just see their college roommates at reunions and just see Joey at Burger King. So is, is that better?
Yes! Wow, well, that-that was easy. Okay, you-you go.
It's just a fur ball.
Who cares, AND?
Are you kidding?!
Hello! Can I get you anything?
That is a great idea! And! I know Ugly Naked Guy because we've been watching him for like five years so that gives me back my edge! Oh, let's see now he had the trampoline.
Nope, nope, that's it.
Stay away!
All right, I just wanted to check.
Okay, okay, okay.
Well, I'm going to take off. Congratulations man.
Ooh, ooh. Because she's my ex-wife, and will probably want to bring her, ooh, ooh, lesbian life partner.
What?!
Hey, what took you guys so long? Your cab left when ours did!
Oh hey! Hey uh, you remember the necklace I gave you last year? Can I see it?
Pretty soon I guess.
What?
Yeah, huh.
Cigarettes?!!
Yeah, so uh, is it sore or can you do stuff?
God, that was, that was amazing, that was incredible. You guys, you guys kicked butt.
No! No! That's-that's time-out!
Hey Chandler. Monica!
Oh no!
The first time! No seriously, imagine if Carol hadn't realized she was a lesbian.
Then you are neither of your parents!
I have sex with dinosaurs??
Look, what do you want me to do? Do you want me to call everyone in the entire school and tell them it wasn't true?!
So uh, wha-uh, what do you do?
Did I do something to you?
Do you mind if I sit here for a sec.?
All right. Okay, here we go!
I'm a professor here uh, Ross...Geller.
She's not- past, she's present, she's back.
Yes! We're getting married?!
Finally, factoring the profusion of new species recently discovered: Gigantosaurus, Argentinasaurus...
If you don't believe me, let's go talk to him, okay? I'm telling you, he didn't ask me one paleontological question.
What are you, a child?
The Armadillo was actually not so thrilled about that part! Okay Ben, it's time to light the Hanukkah candles!
Y'know what? I-I-I... I-I have had enough of this! Y'know, I-I-I care a great deal about your daughter and I have treated her with nothing but respect! So if-if you've got a problem with me, frankly...
Ah well, can't blame a guy for trying!
Oh, I don't know, they seem to have a shared interest in each other's tonsils...
Yeah. And did you, did you pack that bathing suit?
I assume we're looking for an answer more sophisticated than 'to get you into bed'.
You don't believe in evolution?
Wait a minute, I know why I'm being such an ass, why are you?
THE HELL I DO!
Aww, is it broken?
All right, ready?
When Monica was a little girl, I remember that--Ooh!! Ow! Very good!
Well, hey. You're an actor, I say you just suck it up and do it. Or you just do it.
Y'know how-how the nurse said that-that Nana had passed? Well, she's not, quite..
I guess he musta gotten the part in that play.
Yeah, just... just Nana stuff.
Hey!
Hi.
Y'know what? I'm good! I'm good!
You're wrong.
Yeah-uh-huh. Tomorrow night, Valentine's Day, the most romantic day of the year. Who knows what could happen? I might not be shutting my drapes to show her my slides, if you know what I mean.
Not-not really. Th-th-there was just Carol.
I think this is it. I don't know, maybe we should keep looking.
Okay! Okay! Fine, I'll stop! No teaching, okay? We'll just watch the pretty light streaking across the sky. Okay? Who's official name is Bapstein-King.
So Rachel, what're you, uh... what're you up to tonight?
And what did he ask you not to call him?
No, hey-hey, come on, Ben, Santa is not mad at you, okay? Hey, you're-you're his favorite little guy!
Are you serious?
Petty...
All right then.
You've really crossed the line here, but that's okay, it's ok 'cause I'm on my way to buy some Photoshop software and a stack of gay porn. That's right! Your coming out is about to get real graphic.
Hey.
Yeah, yeah, what's with the trophy!
I couldn't.
Bye Ryan.
Are you kidding?
Yeah, I mean... I think when it's your shot, y'know, you-you know it's your shot. Did it... feel like your shot..?
What?! No! No! Wait! You're right, this is stupid. Who cares what people think? I mean, I mean we like each other right? There's nothing wrong with that. Come on. Burt? Lydia? Mel? This is Elizabeth.
I gotta get to work.
Yay!
In the death seat?!!
Hi, welcome, to an adult conversation.
Well I'm sorry but, that-that's really not my problem.
Oh, yeah, no problems. It's all taken care of.
Okay, I think I got it.
Yeah.
Fine. I'll go.
No no, about a month ago she gave her number to some guy in a bar.
Yeah? Joey really knows his art, huh?
We're fine, we're fine.
Excellent!
No, you don't.
Yeah.
Well, but aren't you pissed at him?! I mean this guy abandoned you! I gotta tell you if this were me, this guy would be in some serious physical danger! I mean I-I-I'd walk in there and I'd be like, "Yo, dad! You and me outside right now!" I kinda scared myself.
Come on! Come on! Here, okay-okay, you see this? This tiny thing that looks like a peanut?
Yeah, you didn't expect her to live there with a baby did you?
Did you just wink at me?
Ironically, most of the boxes seem to be labeled clothes.
Well, she'll call back, don't be such a baby.
You don't know?! Rach, you balded my girlfriend!
You know what, he's a big boy, I'm sure he'll find us, ok?
well then I didn't need to bother you or the four other Mike Hanagens I bothered.
Are you trying to get me to bribe you?
Yeah?
Rach, I think I'm gonna wait out here, because my throat is feeling a little scratchy, I don't want to infect him.
Well, Rachel's having drinks with him tonight.
Okay. You can feel all the bones in your skull.
Hey, anyone hear from Phoebe yet?
No, NO! Look, I need to talk to Joey. I mean, you guys just broke up. Before anything more happens between us, I need to know he's okay with it.
Hey! How you doing?
How are you?
Hi. I'm uh, I'm Ross. I don't, I don't believe we've met. I'm Monica's older brother.
Hey!
No. Your mother really did the work. I was busy with the business. I wasn't around that much. Is that what this is about?
Listen, can you do me a favor? I'm gonna be out today. Can you just keep an eye on Joey, make sure nothing happens between him and Molly?
Excuse me?
Hey guys!
Y'know, okay. You're right. It is huge. So why don't we take it just a little bit at a time? Okay? Umm, forget getting married for a sec; just forget about it. Can you just come home and take a shower?
Huh. Wow, this is great.
Ah, it's good. It's going good. I mean, we get along great. She's, she's so...
Phoebe?
Really?
Everyone gets a goodbye but me? What have I got to do to get a goodbye, huh? Be best friends with you? Uh, go out with you? Have a baby with you? Oh wait a minute, wait a minute, I did all those things.
This is my son having lunch, ok? It's gonna happen a lot, so you'd better get used to it. Now if you have any problem with it, if you're uncomfortable, just ask questions. Carol's fine with it, now come on.
Nineteen Eighty Seven. The weekend you guys visited me at school.
Hey-hey, it's valid okay? And I'm not the only one who thinks so, Monica agrees with me.
Rach, thanks but uh, I don't need you doing me any favors.
Oh, come on, now you know you want 'em.
Sorry. . You ok?
You are way off, pal.
Y'know what? The doctor will be in soon, why don't we not speak until then.
Uh, Phoebe...
This is the single greatest day of my professional career. Gunther, six glasses!
You were incredible! Brand new woman, ladies and gentlemen.
Anyway. That's when our Mom said we were not to play football ever again.
Just the one divorce in '99! Y'know what, I am gonna be happy this year. I am gonna make myself happy.
Yes! That's where we realized we were both super cool people!
I got it. So hi, I'm uh, I'm Ross and this is my friend Chandler.
I'm supposed to attach a brackety thing to the side things, using a bunch of these little worm guys. I have no brackety thing, I see no whim guys whatsoever and- I cannot feel my legs.
Thanks. I know you guys like to give me a hard time and all, but it really means a lot to me that you like her. Just knowing that you guys are...
Hot dog?
Oh, you have to call the police! That's what I did to the kids in my building!
Molly, ah, do you mind giving us just a minute?
Yeah, which she probably stole from some cheerleader.
Dad, we-we can't believe you're selling the house.
Hey. Happy Thanksgiving!
How about we settle this right now! There! Now, no one's going to the game. Ha-ha-ha!
Oh, great. It's starting to rain, that will make it easy to get a cab.
I don't have too. I can just look at you.
Don't you realise none of this would've ever happened if I didn't think at that same moment you weren't having sex with Mark?
Okay. Okay. I mean I'll be okay. It's just I don't think I handled it very well.
That's closer.
Oh God.
Oh, I am very in.
It was, it was great. Oh, what happened?
Don't you realise what you're-you're doing to yourself?
No.
Oh, that is so sweet. No, no, ok, you hang up. Ok, ok, one, two, three. Well you didn't hang up either.
How do you know? I mean we thought Carol was straight before I married her!
No-no. We...
I am not in love with her. She was very upset about having to move out so I eh, didn't tell her we were still married because she would only get more upset. I-I just comforted her, as a friend.
My mommies love me. That's clever.
Electrifying. Emphatic time-time-time...
How's Monica coming along with her vows?
Well, ??? think that's us?
Yeah, yeah, just a tough day at work. A stegosaurus fell over and trapped a kid. Whoa, whoa, I know this jacket, this is, th--Fun Bobby's jacket! Where is he, what. He, he's here, isn't he?
I heard it. I heard it.
Wooooooo, hehehe. Hey, ahh, you don't feel like you're gonna throw up, do ya?
College?
Okay, okay. This morning you said there was nothing so big that we couldn't work past it together...
Well, I-I was watching her the other day at the pizza place.
Good, 'cause the ladies, not so much.
This feels perfectly normal. Ok, get on the swing!
Nooo!
So, how was the honeymoon?
...a what? A what? What's the end of that sentence?
Oh, oh. Of course. God, I'm so stupid. You guys are a couple now. I mean, you probably just want to be alone.
Ah, we're out. I sold them all.
Er.... um.....
That was good.
Hey Pheebs, could you please not put your feet up on my new......old sheet?
We know you took so just-just save yourself the time and confess!
Oh no. Dad! Dad! What... Oh God...everything's ruined! Dad, she's gonna be crushed!
Yeah. There's no breaking them up, is there?
Well, you should've seen the guy that she used to go out with. I mean, he's like Joe Rugby.
I'm not! I'm making it easier! Pick me!
Hey, you wet my pants!
Oh, we have one too!!
Hey!
Oh stop.
Sure. Why not?
All right.
Mr. Dickens gets to pick 'em.
Yes you can!
No you didn't. You said you would, but you never did!
OK! Last night after the party I saw Rachel kissing that jerk from her office out on your balcony.
I have to break up with Charlie?
Put it back exactly where you found it?
I'm sorry I'm late, did I miss anything?
No, it's not a divorce, it is not a divorce! Anyway, I think Rachel and I need to, you know, get on with our lives, maybe, maybe start seeing other people.
Hey listen I uh, talked to Chandler, sorry about the movie.
...now when they found the remains of the Mesozoic Mastodon they discovered what appeared to be the remains of a Paleozoic Amphibian in its jaws! How did it get there?!
Hey, uhm, Phoebe didn't by any chance mention that.
Oh good, you scared me for a minute.
It isn't ridiculous, look around! No one's here!
And that's what's gonna kill me. I'm allergic to kiwi.
Rach!
Nothing, I'm-I'm just, I'm so comfortable with you!
Do you remember the scene with, um, Jabba the Hut? Well Jabba had as, as his prisoner, um, Princess Leia.
Look I've already looked at like a thousand apartments this month and none of them even compares to that one!
I'm dead?
How weird is that? Y'know? You're moving in with me and have the one thing I don't have. It's like uh, in a way you-you complete me kitchen.
I know, and I can't stop sweating.
I could, yeah, I can do that.
Well, I'm just saying, I mean why else would he just, y'know, swoop in out of nowhere for no reason.
No, actually I was just saying it looks like we're not sitting together. But now you mention it, there was ice there that night... It was the first frost...
What?
Yeah. You can help me get my furniture back from Gunther.
Of course you would, your brains are smaller than mine!! Man, I can't compete with the guys she goes out with, they are so out of my league! oh my God!
You said you'd marry Joey?
Hey!
Hey there you go!
Now, hold on! Hold on! Look, look, your daughter and I are supposed to leave tonight for our honeymoon, now-now you-you tell her that I'm gonna be at that airport and I hope that she'll be there too! Oh yeah, I said Rachel's name, but it didn't mean anything, Okay? She's-she's just a friend and that's all! That's all! Now just tell Emily that I love her and that I can't imagine spending my life with anyone else. Please, promise me that you'll tell her that.
You're right. Yours is worse. You are the king of bad Thanksgivings.
Okay! Okay. Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby.
You're right. That's very different. So let's, let's just sign the papers. All right? What?
I guess...It still seems a little... moonlight boat ride!!
Uh, Pheebs, some people call that breaking and entering.
Why'd you say no?
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa, Joey!
Yeah! I know! It was. Oh... the only sad thing is I wasn't around when it happened for the first time.
Hi Frannie, congratulations.
What?
Uh actually, I think I'm gonna skip it.
Look I-I don't know what's going on with you and your husband and what is hopefully an adult dog walker, look can I just say not all men are like that.
I know, I know! When I was here for Holidays on Ice I was sitting so far away Michelle Kwan couldn't read my banner!
Hey!
Dude, we got to talk.
My God! These pants are burning up! Oh come on, she wants to snuggle now! What is she trying to kill me? It's like a volcano in here! Are you hot?
I just, I hate this so much! I mean, every time I go pick her up at the airport, it's-it's so great. But at the same time I'm thinking, "Well, I'm gonna be right back there in a couple of days, dropping her off."
Y'know what, y'know what, I'm-I'm not the one that wanted that, that break, okay. You're the one that bailed on us. You're the one that, that ran when things got just a little rough!
Hi.
Eat your fish.
Yeah, all right, it's a date.
That's my gym.
Dear Mary-Angela. Hi. How's it going. This is the hardest letter I've ever had to write. What the hell's a matter with you? How do you think Joey's going to react when he finds out that you blew off his sister with a letter?
What? Wh- hello? The Millners' farm in Connecticut? The Millners, they had this unbelievable farm, they had horses, and, and rabbits that he could chase and it was- it w- .....Oh my God, Chi Chi!
Marlon?!
Yes, yes I am. And you are a....
She's having lunch with him. She's having lunch with him. And you should of seen the hug she gave him when she got the job. And, and, and, he's really good looking. What am I gonna do?
Phoebe, I...
Damn!
Yeah-No!!
Let's celebrate with some maple candy!
Oh God!
Lift!! And slide!
You know, I might have expected this of you Phoebe, but Ryan, you're a military man.
Man!
Rachel says sharing's great and supposedly, you know, we outta be doing it. Do you wanna?
Hi.
Hello!!
Laugh it up, but the joke's on you. Because we don't need to get divorced, okay? We we're just gonna get an annulment.
Wait a minute! No! I'm the nice one! I'm the one who danced with the kids all night! How...How small are your feet?!
Look, Chandler, it's my joke. But, hey, if it makes you feel any better they don't print the name, so it doesn't really matter who gets credit, right?
Dude. Well done. You know what? If I die, and Rachel dies and Monica dies then you can totally take care of Emma.
How come it's not mixing with the water?
Oh my God! What happened to the door?!
So he hasn't called?
Hi!
Oh! No-n-
Good, so everybody's here. Everybody's good. So, were you gonna play something, Phoebe?
Yes, I do.
Oh I don't know that it would.
Hey!
Chappy's heart rate has slowed way down.
Hey, I seem to remember someone bringing his security blanket to college!
Yeah?
Thank you, but I want to remove it Pheebs. I don't want to make it savory.
Ah, that's okay, thanks.
Who is Maria?
Ow, ow, OK. Alright, alright, Mon, Mon, you've gone ultrasonic again, alright.
Em-Emily? Em-Emily? Emily!
Right that's why I came over to talk about. Hum...I saw Rachel kissing some guy on your balcony,even though there were NO LIGHTS !
No, no, no. Don't do that! I want you to look her in the eyes, and tell her the truth.
Hey. Who's that?
Do you really?
Okay.
Not broad backed!
You were at the coffeehouse!
Hi.
Elizabeth! Okay. Okay. I'm gonna go out this window. I'll meet you at the front door. Just tell them you're going home, okay?
: OK, I am calling your seventeen. What do you got?
Hey!
Tag? Y-You're going? Uh we didn't, uh we didn't get the chance to talk. Uh, so, where did you say you're from again?
Ok.
Your ex-boyfriend?
What, now you're not even taking to me? Look Rachel, I-I'm sorry, okay, I'm sorry, I was out of my mind. I thought I'd lost you, I didn't know what to do. Come on! Come on, how insane must I have been to do something like this? Huh? I-I don't cheat right, I, that's not me, I'm not Joey!
Hey-hey, what are those?
FINE BY ME!!
Right. Okay, let's play. Let's go.
Okay dad.
No-no-no, a bunch of out of control jackets take over an island.
Joey, you look nothing like Ben.
Oh hi!
Rachel, only one of us can do it, you have to choose. You and me together again.
Yeah.
Hi, did you order some bananas?
Chandler!!! Chandler!!! Chandler, I saw what you were doing through the window! Chandler, I saw what you were doing to my sister! Now get out here!
Ohh...
Sometimes I wonder if I did the right thing, ya know, giving him away.
Susan, go deep.
I just wanna read something. It's your pro list.
It came in the mail today, it's uh, 72 long-stemmed red roses, one for each day that I've known and loved Emily, cut up into mulch!
...Gets interrupted. Hi!
Unbelievable. She says goodbye to everyone but me.
Well, uh, for your information, there's a woman at the museum, who's curator of moths and other... uh... winged things... who's, uh, let it be known that she is drawn to me much like a... well, you know. But so far I've been keeping her at bay, but, uh, if this is the deal...
Yes, yes, you did.
Uh, you know, you can't always get a seat on the subway, so...
Well, I was just playing with him, and y'know we were doing the alphabet song, which he used to be really good at, but suddenly he's leaving out 'e' and 'f.' It's like they just ah, I don't know, fell out of his head.
Wait uh, listen. I-I, I have to tell you something. Umm, I've been thinking, I'm just gonna come out and say it. Okay? I-I-I ah, I-I think I love you.
I can't believe we have to say goodbye to the house we grew up in. Man, some-some stranger's gonna be living in my room.
I'm the Holiday Armadillo, your part-Jewish friend. You sent me here to give Ben some presents. Remember?
C'mon, it's my birthday.
Ah, what good are you.
Just three?! I'm dilated three!
Yeah, Charlie is gonna be joining my department.
Hey! Uh, Phoebe's not here is she?
Oh, I'm sure.
Let me see! Show them!
Knock-knock.
Oh, ye-ah!
What disposable cameras?
Hey, here's a question; where did you guys get the finest oak East of the Mississippi?
Yeah.
Okay, umm I want you to know that I have never done anything like this before. I mean, I mean I've been in um, relationships in general, uh but I have never done it with a student-I mean I not-not it! I mean, I mean I don't-We haven't done it. Uh, I mean, I mean, we've-we've-we've done stuff. Okay, okay, a joke, a joke-lighten the mood. Umm, two guys go into a bar. One of them is Irish.
Uh, I'm not really a shot drinking kinda guy.
Wow, I hadn't thought of that. I hope not.
Hey Phoebe!
I love you too! I'm, I'm gonna call you right now from the phone booth! You can't hear me.
What should I wear, now I'm all nervous.
A little. Yeah. I made a snack.
Oh and you know what, it will be even better tomorrow, because I won't be constantly interrupted by Joey checking to see if they put chocolates on my pillow yet. .
Oh, yeah, hello, well, now, here I am.
This is helping your career?! Huh? I thought you wanted to be an actor not the creator of crazy lawsuit game!
Look, I know what you're going through. When I turned 50 I got the Porsche. You... you got your own little speedster.
Bye sweetie.
What?
What?
No! Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah! You can have this back when the five pages are done! Ahh!
What?
What do you think you're gonna do, have sex with her right here on my couch?
Oke-dokey.
What?
Okay, this is getting a little crazy. I mean, I'm-I'm sure it would be amazing but I...gotta say I really-really don't think it would be a good idea. Y'know? I really, really...don't.
I am now.
'Cause otherwise they'd have to call it the room room.
What? I can't cancel on Joan!
That's, that's, that's a big candy bar. I had the most amazing time with you.
Oh my God, you've got a crush on your sister's stalker.
Yeah, yeah, it'll be great! You can, you can lay on the beach and I can cry over my failed marriage. See-see how I make jokes?
Hi!
You're not a lefty?
Well did you try calling her?
Hi Amy!
Yeah?
That's cool.
This is the coolest house ever!!
Right? And this! She-she could've won this!
Oh my god, it was you! I can't believe it, you... you mugged me?
Why not?
You'll never get me, Joe!!!
Yeah, it does sound interesting, I mean, to listen to a woman complain for two hours, I don't think it gets bett...
Then don't do that, alright?
Hi honey, how did it go?
Thanks, I put a lot of extra thoughts on your gift.
Well, why're you all dressed up?
I know where Joey would be. He would be down in the foxhole protecting all of us.
Well uh, y'know what? Even if she doesn't know anything, I do! I have a son. And his mother and I didn't live together, and whenever he was with me I took care of him all the time, by myself.
Chandler, have you ever put on a black cocktail dress and asked me up to your hotel room?
Okay.
Hey.
And we didn't have sex.
There was never a good time.
Honey. Honey, have you seen my Harmon Kilerbrew bat? Bob doesn't believe I have one.
: Joey, I'm a little shy.
So you said yes to him, and you just had our baby?
No, because your not upset.
You know what, you guys, we don't have to watch this.
I was talking to myself! You're going down!
Oh, Emily that is, that is so great. It's gonna be so great! We're gonna be like-like-like two idiots in love!
Hey, you're not naked! So hey, Rach, when will we expect to see you tonight?
Rachel!!!
I love you.
Get out!
It's my joke.
I need juice! People need juice!!
Okay, I guess it's just flan for three! Hey, hey, that rhymed!
Ewwww!!
Hey! You were so right!
Hey-hey, since you're the 'fix-it' lady, here's a pickle, what do you do when the bride says she doesn't want to have the wedding at all?
About what?
Okay, Fonzy gives you two thumbs up, collect two cool points. Yeah.
Okay!
No one got me an engagement present.
Ok, would people stop drinking the breast milk?
Through the magic of sight! I was here, putting our child to sleep...
Emma.
Are you serious?
Ohh! Okay! Okay. "There are three primary theories concerning sediment flow rate. Each of these theories can be further subcategorized into..."
Is it? Feels like two.
Oh, oh, I'm, I'm, I'm sorry sweetie, I was just trying to ah, I'm dialing another number.
Come on Rach, you don't have what, ten minutes?
Hi.
Are you're hands still wet?
How would he like to come with me to the Museum of Natural History after everyone else has left, just the two of us, and he can touch anything he wants. . I just heard it as you must have heard it and that's not good. Let me start again. I'm a paleontologist, you'll be there with us and the touching refers only to bones... fossils!
Hey! So what's the big news you had us rush all the way over here for?
Hey, I need a ticket.
Awesome!
Oh good.
Then I'm happy too.
No. No.
Who would you rather be Simon or Garfunkle?
The guy who took Rachel to the prom? Why is he calling you?
He said he liked that!! Oh you're right, you're right. I'm sorry.
What. Oh no, you just rolled over the juice box.
Check it out, he actually is the MonkeyShine monkey.
Thanks a lot.
Hey guys!
Wait, wait a minute, there's no light on the back wall! How do I know when it's gonna start? Hello? Ah, oh, ah! Ah! The same thing happened again!
Oh-oh, guess what? I-I have a date with Elizabeth Hornswoggle.
Mr. Morse I need to talk to you about your mid-term exam, I'm afraid I-I had to fail you.
Huh. This is nice.
Yeah, he can do it!
Well actually, I'm picking Ben up tomorrow, maybe he'll be there.
of course she has. if she'd never had a serious relationship I'd go round broadcasting it like some unstoppable moron.
Yeah, I'm missing out on all this other stuff, too. So, Joey suggested Rachel move in with me.
Well, I wanted to be thorough. I mean this-this is clearly very, very important to you, to us! And so I wanted to read every word carefully, twice!
Ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect... So what's new? Still, uh...
I was hugging her as a friend. It's not my fault her-her hair got in my face, she's got a lot of it and it smells all-all uh...coconutty. What?! Oh, that doesn't mean I have feelings for Rachel! Maybe it means I have feelings for coconuts!
Okay.
Oh here, I think this is us. Yeah.
Yeah. I mean, it's been kinda quiet since Carol left, so...
It was totally flirting. "Somebody got a haircut "
Actually I'm a palian... Dinosaurs is fine... the drawing is not.
Emily's cousin kicked me out!
Thank you.
So weird to see all these people again... Oh my God, look, there's Geoffrey Cleric.
Phoebe, oh my God! Wh-wh-what are you doing here?
I'm sweeping...
Well, I'd love to! Here, you wait right here and I'll go get the projector and my notes!
All right, I'll do it.
Well, why don't you just start with something simple. Like umm, Monica from the moment I met you, I knew I loved you.
Well certain other people take two hours to eat a bowl of soup!
Yeah, well...nah.
I'm gonna go.
I swear to God...!
Yeah.
Thirty seconds, all the questions you can answer.
Hey! So, uhh, Amanda just-just dropped me off. Yeah, that's one of the things I love about her, she's...uh, she's old enough to drive. So uhh, I guess you're not going to mom and dad's tonight?
Wow, cool poster. Or should I say groovy poster? So, ahh, where were we?
What kind of research?
Oh, please...
Fine.
Lemme see.
No, a car backfired, but I thought somebody was taking a shot at me. And Rach, I...I survived! And I was filled with this-this great respect for life. Y'know? I-I want to experience every moment. I want to seize every opportunity. I-I am seeing everything so-so clearly now.
That's not a thing!
G-gift? The thing's not the gift?
Well it's okay. Chandler is talking to her.
....and 12, 22, 18, four... What?
I am, yes.
Okay, how about, for a guy, Thatcher?
I'm gonna have to give him up.
Susan is Carols, Carols, Carols, friend...
Hey, remember how Chandler and Phoebe blew us off yesterday?
Uh.... bean! Bean!
Well, with everything that's been going on lately, I haven't exactly been the perfect boyfriend. You know, I, uh, I didn't tell her I got Rachel pregnant. I gave her a key to my apartment, and then had the locks changed! And then I lied to her about Rachel moving in with me. In a way, I actually judge her for not breaking up with me sooner, you know?
Excellent! How do you put a baby down for a nap?
That is what the thing is.
Then where the hell have you been?!
Why did you hate me?
What?! You're in love with her.
Hey! Hey Adrienne.
Oh, God. I forgot how hot she was!
Oh-oh, wait, my mother is gonna be here any minute. And she has the keys.
Well, I still think I was right about that whole Mark thing.
Okay!
Oh my God! You really want me to be the keynote speaker? Thank you!
Well, yeah. I can't-I can't stay here all night, and if I go in there she's-she's gonna wanna... do stuff.
Permission to veto.
Right!
Oh, I'm just over here with Ben. I thought we'd say hi.
Joey!!
Thanks man.
Look, that has nothing to do with this, ok? She's my ex-wife. If she were marrying a guy, none of you'd expect me to be there.
That would be nice.
Dude, don't worry 'bout it! I know how we can make your money back! This is a nice hotel, you know, plenty of amenities, we just load up on those! Like those apples. Instead of taking one, I'm... I take six!
You will?!
Practical jokes.
Ooh, well. Ah, I kinda have got a lot on my plate right now, not that I wouldn't love a weekend in the country with a strange man.
Easy. Easy. You have to go to the hospital. Okay?
No, I-I got really hot in my leather pants so I took them off but they must have shrunk from the-the sweat or-or-or my legs expanded from the heat. Look, I-I can't put them back on. I can't!
Sure. Once, at work I-I thought carbon dating was fossilized...
Look, our table is down in front, okay, my boss is gonna be there, everyone will see if we arrive after it starts.
I could ask her to live with me!
Fine, you're right. Let's ah, let's take a break, let's cool off, okay, let's get some frozen yoghurt, or something..
Well, at least she's with Pop-Pop and Aunt Phyllis now.
Petty...
Good. I'm just getting some coffee. So I'm alert for the wedding.
I think I have an old band uniform from high school.
All right, show's over. Nothing to see here. Ok, let's do laundry.
I'm sorry about your date.
He didn't get the goggles!
'Scuse us
Hey guys.
I really think they're out of rooms.
Question. Why do we always have to have parties where you poach things?
Okay! All clear!
Wh-Hey-Whoa-whoa, where, where you going?!
Yeah, you really sidestepped that land mine.
Yeah. I'm sorry too. I'm even more sorry that that phone call didn't come before I told you about looking through the window.
I'm sorry, it's just one of my last nights together before she leaves for camp-to be a counselor!
What code?
Four percent. Okay. I tip more than that when there's a bug in my food.
And while that was good advice, you should know that what-what she wants...
Check it out! Almost 3 hours without droppin' it!
How do you count to five?
What?
Le Poo's still alive?!
No! No! I want to talk now! Okay? I-In fact, I am going to talk to the president of the condom company!
Y'know what? I'm gonna go out on a limb and say no divorces in '99!
Only when it was damp!! I can't believe you-you told people about this?! Everybody knew?! Y'know what? I'm back in the club!
No!
In the bank.
My son? Pretty serious. Oh hey Katie! What uh, what are you doing here?
And the place looks so nice!
Rach, I think you're reading a little too much into it.
Yeah!
I don't think so! You're just giving me Ruth so you'll get to name it when it's a boy, and that's when you'll swoop in and name him Heath or Blaine or Sequoia.
Yes, yes it is! No, but it's good it's-Emily thinks we should get all new stuff. Stuff that's just ours, together. Y'know brand new.
With you?! Yeah right!
It's the museum again, can I, oh.
I had just moved in. Thank you! Listen umm...
Breathe! Breathe! Breathe throw the pain.
Yes.
I'm having a boy! I-I'm having a boy!
Oh, 's'funny, really? Um, I don't remember you making any sperm.
Hi!
Rach, do you uh, are you gonna separate those?
Everyone thinks they know me. Everyone says 'Jack Geller, so predictable'. Maybe after I'm gone, they'll say 'Buried at sea! Huh!'.
Yeah. Right. Save it. I can do that.
It tastes like feet!
Come on Chappy, do your business. MAKE! MA-AKE! I did not sign on for this.
No.
Phoebe he's right, that is the rule.
So I'm a pimp huh? It's okay! Look, I know that sometimes I can be a pain in the ass, but you just have to talk to me. Tell me if something is bothering you. Okay? And for my part I will do everything I can to keep my annoying habits just .
OK you...you really don't know what I am talking about?
Hey-hey Pheebs!
Umm...
I love you too, and I'm never letting you go again.
We're so lucky.
Huh?
Yeah.
Where'd you get fruit at four in the morning?
Chandler was hitting on the hot delivery girl!
NO! I don't!!
Oh no.
Hey!
Not for tonight. Not for tonight! Wh-what, what, what, are you doing?
'I am Bea. I drink tea. Won't you dance around with....' Ohhh!
And I can even understand that you couldn't tell Rachel, but why couldn't you tell me, huh? You had all day to and you didn't.
So Joey, you okay?
Woah, ho-ho, whad'ya got there, a weapon?
Uhm no! Think less of you! No, I don't think less of you. I mean, you saw someone you liked and you kissed them. I mean, those people who like someone and don't kiss them... those-those people are stupid, I hate those people.
Hey!
You took my watch?
Just you keep it, listen did you, did you tell anyone about us?
Hello to the rest.
I swear!
No I-I-I would love to be around for you and the baby. And we-we can just try it like on a temporary basis.
Okay Ben, Santa has to go. Say good-bye!
What?! Over a stupid room!
No, you don't.
Ah actually we don't.
Hey!
The test is ready.
You're gonna be an aunt.
You are such a tattletale! Mom, Dad, you remember that-that time you walked in my room and smelled marijuana?
Do not give him any money!
Emily? Emily? I'm coming in.
Okay.
Come on! Here.
All right I guess I'm, gonna go pack.
What are you talking about?
You know what the scariest part is? What if there's only one woman for everybody, y'know? I mean what if you get one woman- and that's it? Unfortunately in my case, there was only one woman- for her...
She's putting words in your mouth!
I have to talk to her about this groomsman situation, ok? I'm not gonna watch Chandler up there while I'm sitting in the seats like some chump! . Oh! My God! You're breathtaking!
You're over me?
No, sorry I don't. Tell me why would anyone pay someone to scar their body for life? What if it doesn't come out right Phoebe? Then it's like, I don't know, havin' a bad hair cut all the time. Why's everyone staring at me?
Okay, I'll just wait for him in here!
What do you mean "no"? I knew you'd be my death, Phoebe Buffay.
Monica knows.
No, that's all right.
I hate America! When I finish this game, I swear I am moving.
Wait a minute, there's two sets of nozzles, which one is it?
Neither will I.
Ok, and then you take the poopie diaper and you put it in the poopie diaper pail.
And officiating at tonight's blackout, is Rabbi Tribbiani.
Keep pushing!
Ok, gentlemen! Please! Aren't we a little old for this? I mean, we're scientists, right? We're academics. And most importantly I... you-you will have to catch us first. . GO, GO, GO!
Oh, well you see how it works is, the part with Dick Clark in Times Square is actually live, but they tape some of the party stuff ahead of time. Yeah, not a lot of people know that.
Oh yeah! You're-hey, you're right! Here's an affordable place, two bedroom, close to work, ooh, it's available in five weeks!
Oh, sorry. Well, look, maybe I can help you with it.
What?
Ye... Yeah... Yeah... You got shellfish in your head.
Yeah, see, we-we-we have to stop across the hall, because it's my sister. But, uh, uh y'know actually, growing up with a sister was nice because it really helped me understand women. Yeah, you-you should tell your friends that.
Oh. Uhh...
I wanna get out of the room! Y'know, I...I really miss downstairs.
Phoebe.
Phoebe! I can't believe you gave them money! I thought you agreed it was totally unreasonable that they asked me for that money!
So, then you can stay as long as you want.
You can't just call Godfather. Don't you think her brother should be Godfather?
Seven.
Excuse me.
Uh, that, that, that would be a judgment call.
OH MY GOD!! I didn't really believe it until you just said it!!
Now you guys just got married, why is she so depressed?
Hey!
Who?
All right, see you later.
My God Monica!!
Hey! Hi Bonnie!
Really?
I got it! Hey, you get to sleep with her, I get the cramps.
What?
Hey I uh just picked up Ben from school...
Well, I'm gonna kiss you.
Hey.
Hey Gunther, can I get a couple of blueberry muffins to go?
Nothing, it's just that hypnosis is beyond crap.
Uh, okay, yeah, we could do that, but before we head off to the murder capital of the North-East, I was, uh, kinda wanting to run something by you. Y'know how we were, uh, y'know, talking before about, uh, relationships and stuff? Well-
Well, we're applying to a lot of them. Naturally our first choice would be one of the bigger state zoos, y'know, like, uh, San Diego... right? But that might just be a pipe dream, because, y'know, he's out of state. Uh, my vet, uh, knows someone at Miami, so that's a possibility.
Hey!
Oh. Listen, have you ever been uh, you know, foolin' around with a girl and uh, she started laughin'?
Good. Maybe he can switch it back.
Yeah?
Hi.
No. When he called, I...I threw the message away.
No, no, no, this weekend guys!
I love when you talk dirty to me.
Oh, nothin' much. Just trying to figure out what I'm gonna do for dinner.
I'll do it. Hey, whatever you need me to do, I'm your man. Whoa-oh-whoa! Are you, are you okay?
Hey!
Well, maybe he just didn't want to hurt your feelings.
Okay, okay take a guess.
Hey.
I am the guy who's taking care of our baby while you're out at bars meeting guys!
Uhm, ministers don't ride the subway for free.
Hey. When you guys were kids and you played Happy Days, who were you? I was always Richie.
Postpone it? Emily, do you think Monica realises how much our parents spent on this wedding? Do you my sister's teeny-tiny little brain comprehends that people took time out of their lives to fly thousands of miles to be here, huh? This isn't right.
Oh yeah, she's-she's amazing. And-and she's so much fun. And! Y'know what? When I'm with her, I'm fun! I even signed up for helicopter classes. She's leaving in two days, I don't have to do it.
Oh, I don't, I don't, I don't know...
When I got married you slept with my sister.
Aww that is so cool.
Oh look, I can't believe this. Look, homo-habilus hasn't even learned how to use tools yet and they've got him here wi, with clay pots. Why don't, why don't they just give him a microwave? I'm sorry, I'm sorry this is taking so long, ya know, I, I, it's just it's longer than I expected, we will have dinner.
Wait, well wh-wh-wh-where is she?
Well... not in the same way...
Okay.
Rach, I'm so sorry.
But you already told me everything.
It's an empty apartment.
Uhh, naa, no no no, I, I must be thinking of someone else, uh, maybe me. Don't you have some folding to do? Go fold dear. Fold. You fold.
Get him! GET HIM! Get him! Get- YESSS! Not laughing now, are ya pal!
You can totally, totally live on this.
I could put uh-uh a basketball court in the back.
Okay, bye-bye.
Well, Mon, I was married.
Oh yeah? What are you gonna do?
Joey, the guy's your best friend.
Yeah, we went shopping!
That's, that's funny. Change!
Phoebe!
I'm ok.
Now I cannot wait to see this.
Do you uh, do you talk about me?
Joey proposed to you?
Open it, open in.
Wait, how do you zoom out? There she is.
What are you doing?
...Chandler!
It's heads. Gentlemen, pick your category.
Oh thank you. Thanks very much. Ow!
Oh, sure. Whoa-whoa, what's this? The delivery charge is almost as much as the couch!
I'm not a nice guy.
I have to say you are a much bigger person than I am. I mean after all we've been through, I just-y'know I wish I had a brother to reciprocate. Hey, if you ever want to go out with Monica, you have my blessing.
I will give you a call.
Oh my God! Rachel Green?
What thing?
OK. Here goes. For a while now, I've been wanting to, um....
Yeah.
Hey!
No, Chandler, you have to find the line between stealing and taking what the hotel owes you. For example: hair drier, no, no, no, but shampoo and conditioners, yes, yes, yes. Now, the salt shaker is off-limits, but the salt I wish I'd thought this through.
Looks to me like he's the one getting the job.
Hey!
Now you are going to love these.
I don't know Rachel, why?
What?!
Oh. Yeah?
Hello! I'm in the front seat, okay? I'm Gary's partner!
Little girl misses her cat. Crazy lady thinks her mother is in a cat. Okay, y'know what, I have to go have dinner with my son, can I trust that when you see Phoebe, you will tell her.
What?! Give-give me a brush.
Hey!
Get the what?
Cool!
Okay look, do-do, you have anything Christmassy? I promised my son, and I really don't want to disappoint him, um, come on, I...uh, you gotta have something.
It's nothing, I just gave her a hug.
Go.
What do you think you learnt how to do in the last two minutes??
I-I had to show Chandler something?
I'm getting married today!! Ahh, whoo-hoo!!
I don't know, I told her it was stupid to put off the wedding just because the hall was gone and she liked flipped out.
Oh yeah, why not?
Well, I just made these two things uhm... cheeks. And then I split this to make ears.
What about Ben? We can't bring a baby to a hospital.
Look at me!
All right, let's go! Bye, Pheebs!
Is everything okay?
That is gonna hurt tomorrow!
I've no idea, could be. Listen, I'm sorry I had to work tonight.
Let's not talk about losing. Just deal the...
With the circus? He's behind the elephant.
No. No, I didn't. I didn't want to be that guy.
And it could've just as easily have been a bullet.
Hey!
Hello? Oh no! What happened? Ok ok, where are you? . Ok, I'll be right there.
So suck it up man, it's a job, it's money.
No, she likes that. Yeah. Faking sleep doesn't work either, I can't tell you how many mornings I woke up with her...
That was just the pants on the couch. Umm, hey, do you, do you mind if I use your bathroom?
I am so gonna score.
But I didn't want to.
Oh, ah, you don't need that.
No, no, that won't be ah, that won't be necessary
Anyway, if she, if she wasn't in to me, why-why would she ask me out again?
Laugh all you want but uh, she actually left me a message saying she'd like to go out again.
My wife's a lesbian.
Hi Dr. Greene. So, uh, how's everything in the uh, vascular surgery....game?
Th-th-that's all it is, a third nipple. Y'know? Just your run-of-the-mill third nipple. Y'know? You can take it off. Just slice that baby right off!
Pheebs, come on, you didn't kill anybody, these people just happened to die when you went to the dentist. It's, it's, it's just ah, a coincidence.
Sorry, I'm sorry. Close, close, close...
I cannot believe we're having this conversation.
Yes.
Ooh! There's no way to do this without her? 'Cause I kinda all ready told her uh, it was, it was already taken care of.
So, are you gonna see him again?
I don't know, probably just invest it.
You're welcome.
No! No! Of course it didn't mean anything! I mean, uh well, I can understand why Emily would think it meant something, y'know, because-because it was you...
You-you-you-you threw my sandwich away!
Not just Janice, Janice in labor, contracting and everything.
Ok fine.
Fine, OK! Heat, heat, heat, and I'm the obsessive one. OK, this way is on, so this is. . . off.
Yay! And that takes what? Just six or seven minutes.
I'm understanding, but let's not get carried away.
It's not a club.
Ohio!! Thank you!
I don't get it. What do you see in this guy, anyway?
Yes, yes it is. It's uh... Every time on the lips! Why?! Why on lips?!
I can't believe they gave you a ticket. You're such a good driver.
What's ah, what's so funny about that?
This guy could be my baby's stepfather!
What are you doing?
Everybody!
Uh, excuse me. Evolution is not for you to buy, Phoebe. Evolution is scientific fact, like, like, like the air we breathe, like gravity.
What? I... I...
Why do they keep doing that?
I don't know what to say.
I know. I am, I am so sorry.
Mmm.
NO!
I wasn't- I mean, I-
Shh. Do you want cran-apple or cran-grape?
So, where did you get your undergraduate degree?
All right I've been feeling incredibly guilty about this, because I wanna be a good friend, and damnit I am a good friend. So just, just shut up and close your eyes.
Okay Phoebe, I guess you're next although I really don't see the point.
Hi! I'm sorry, but can you give me a second while I talk to this woman, who by the way did not spend the night.
We're late too!
Yeah.
Absolutely! You'll love the feeling! There's nothing like it!
Not touching myself if that makes anyone less uncomfortable.
We're good.
Kristen Lang.
That is so good! Do it again!
No, but, it's, you know, it's just a funny image, you know, the two of you, in this restaurant, with... tzz-zzz, mmm.
What?
Hmmm. Oh, no, no, I just thinking about something funny I heard today. Umm, Mark, Mark saying 'I'll see you Saturday.'
Who is intimidating to a guy who won the Nobel Prize?
Yeah, I think she looks good.
Well, everyone's gotta kiss someone. You can't kiss Ross you got the history.
Hmm.
Your page said come to the hospital, what? What was it? What happened?
Hey.
It's Gandolf, and he's not coming.
...and the miracle was that that little bit of oil that should've just lasted just one day, burned for...
Yeah.
Hey, could you do me a favour? Could you just grab me a bottle of water?
You're not his godfather.
Yeah?
I just have to go, all right? Do I need a reason? Huh? I mean I have things to do with my life, I have a jam packed schedule, and I am late- for keeping up with it. Okay?
Hey!
Why, why, why would you dream that?
No, no, NO, you cannot go to dinner with him.
No, this is pretty much it.
Excellent, that was excellent.
Perhaps I can persuade you. What if you can give your son this genuine pterodactyl egg replica.
I'm trying to tell you I made you a mix tape.
Come on. These people'll scooch down. You guys'll scooch, won't you? Let's try scooching! Come on. Come on. Uh, Kristen Riggs, this is Carol Willick. Carol, Kristin. Uh, Carol teaches sixth grade. And, Kristin, Kristin... ...does something that, funnily enough, wasn't even her major!
What's with her?
What?! What?!
Me too!
No, but, but I wanna be with you in spite of all those things.
It is off.
No, I can't get it out.
Now, if you need to stay late, I want to be supportive of that.
Hey-yeah. Hey Gunther, can I have a scone please? Wanna hear some good news? Someone I know is getting married! Yeah! And weddings are happy occasions! Oh, by-the-by it's my ex-wife Emily!
Who cares? I repel women.
Oh okay, lift it straight up over your head! Straight up over your head! You can do it! You can do it! Okay. You got it?
Rach, Rach, we'll be fine, all right? You go have fun.
Hey umm, was-was Monica here?
Yeah.
Why- why are you here, Carol?
Ohh, big smoker. Big big smoker. In fact I'm gonna go ou into the hallway and fire up this bad boy.
Excuse me, is there a woman waiting at the bar? Someone average height, dark hair, perhaps doing a puzzle?
Thanks? But I have plans; Elizabeth and I are going out of town.
No one, I'm just saying if...
Lucky sixes....
What, the word hi?
When, when were you... under me? Rach. Rachel do you, I mean, were you, uh. . . What?
What's up with the greed Joe?
No. No-no uh, he just, he just really freaked me out before.
So, um, what do you do for a living?
No real-, honey, really it's fine, just g-go with Susan. Really, I, no, I think girls night out is a great idea. Okay, okay, bye
Shame on you! Ugly baby judges you!
Guess what?
Y'know what? I'm really not in the mood.
Why aren't you guys dressed?
Ok, then you're gonna have to understand that you're with a guy who's not gonna stop planning his future with you because he knows that we're gonna end up together and if that scares you, tough, 'cause you're gonna have to deal with that.
Hey, where's Rach?
I never did anything with Adrienne Turner.
Really?
Chandler!!! Chandler!!! Chandler, I saw what you were doing through the window! Chandler, I saw what you were doing to my sister! Now get out here!
C'mon, you get the idea, ow-ow-ow we'll make our money back in no time!
no, no, no there's nothing wrong with you I mean you don't strike me as the type of person that wants to get married anyway.
Oh wait-hold it! But then I started thinking and I stopped the kissing.
That would be great.
Really? Well then tell it to me.
Hotel? Why isn't she staying with you guys?
Oh my God. I mean...
Well I...I haven't actually told her yet. I don't want to scare her off, y'know?
That's my sister.
...I'll go. Let's start with the way he kept picking at- no, I'm sorry, I can't do this, can't do this. We loved him.
Oh, come on it's only three blocks! And-and, it's not very heavy, try it! Come on! Come on!
I'll take sports.
I didn't wanna leave him alone. Alright? We- we had our first fight this morning. I think it has to do with my working late. I said some things that I didn't mean, and he- he threw some faeces...
Tell my son that I love him. Excellent! Well, okay, I gotta have some more fun!
Yeah.
Fifteen.
Go, go, go!!
Listen, Joey, I know what he did was wrong but don't you think you could at least hear the guy out?
Wha..? I need 6 graduate students.
You're right, you're right, it is.
You wanna wander in the hall? Ooh, hey Ben, what if the Holiday Armadillo told you all about the festival of lights?
Help! Help!
Hi.
Just ah... just put roommate.
You already know don't you?
Joey where's the pipe that was holding the door open?
Yes, her molecular epidemiology paper is due tomorrow.
They, uh, were infected. He wouldn't have made it.
Alright, alright, let's do this!
What did you want to show us? Because all I can see is this bitchin' van!
Oh yeah, we're uh, yeah we're not together.
Fine.
Hey!
He's in! Oh, did you hear that, Marcel? San Diego. San Diego!
Seriously, I-I asked you before and you still haven't gotten it.
Wow, how many have you got?
What?
Oh.
Hey, where's uh, where's mom?
Huh? Yeah, fine, invite whoever you want.
Carol, honey, shhh, shhh, everythings gonna be alright.
That's all right, Rach, we got the bags. Hi, hello. Julie, this is my sister Monica. This is Chandler. Phoebe. Joey, what up?
Oh, hey, hey, I got that.
Okay, I'm sorry, this is insane! I-I-I'm not addicted to heroin, I'm not gay, and there is no problem with my ability to consummate anything! Look, I'll consummate this marriage right here, right now!
Sure, I-I-I...
I know, uh, the air, the-the trees... even though Nana's gone there's, there's something almost, uh- I dunno, almost life-aff-
She doesn't know which one of us she wants, me or this Colin guy.
And she's a little mannish...
Forty-five minutes.
C'mon Monica, do it. Hey, you guys, um, Monica has some news.
I think the check in is that way.
Now wait a minute, you be nice! All right? I didn't bring you here so you can ambush her.
Oohh, 23. Which is what we play to at this casino! You win 10 dollars!
Number six: the way you smell.
Emma's down for the night.
It wasn't the best.
No!
Oh right. Right. Ooh, remember the time I uh, I pinned you down and tickled you 'til you cried? We're probably too old to do that now.
Ok, do you have any ideas for any openers?
I don't know, I mean you were a lot bigger, I mean, stronger back then.
Y'know, hey! You're the one who ended it, remember?
Second date!
Yeah? Not to you, because you know this stuff. I don't know any of it and I'm the father. I wish I'd be more involved y'know.
Okay, uh, about last night, um, Chandler.. you didn't tell... Okay, 'cause I'm thinking- we don't need to tell Chandler, I mean, it was just a kiss, right? One kiss? No big deal? Right?
Well then, what is it?!
Yeah, it's no big deal. I mean, I just met her and I'm fine with it...
Hey Joey I have to cancel racketball for tonight, that was Marcel's trainer. He's gonna let me have him for a couple of hours.
All right. A room. A man enters, he looks suspicious. That's it? Joey, you're supposed to have five pages done by now! Including an exciting incident! And what is, and what is all this?! The official rulebook of Fireball.
I'm here. How's my little boy? Want Daddy to change your diaper? So, did you have fun with Uncle Joey and Uncle Chandler today?
No! Do you know what your odds are of winning the lottery? I...I mean you have a better chance of being struck by lightning 42 times.
That's it. I'm in my apartment, you're not there, we're not having this conversation.
Hey.
Hi!
Buddy, my monkey, my monkey.
You bought Shawn Cassidy!
Come on! Come on. Come on.
Crazy!
Oh, I am sorry, did you not like her, because I was hoping that we could come to one of your kissing parties onthe balcony.
In the hospital.
You'll see. Okay. Oh, what's-what's her name?
Yeah, and it was uhm... it was like a real little person laugh too. It was... it was like uhm... Only... only not creepy.
Wow. What does that mean?
Joey, please!
Oh there you go!
Y'know, he hums when he pees!
Chloe, Chloe how's it coming?!!
Hey!
I know! I know. You know what? I'm putting Ruth back on the table!
...desperate, needy, pathetic?
I can't believe this. I was just being a good guy. I treated you with respect and understanding.
Okay, she can't go.
Well that brings me in the loop a little.
Nice!
Hey!
Uh, how long until they announce the numbers, Mommy?
Uh.
Ok, Pheebs. See how I'm making these little toys move? Opposable thumbs. Without evolution, how do you explain opposable thumbs?
We're just tryin' to do a nice thing here.
That cup is mine!
All right! I want my key back!
Okay.
Ok, odd thing to get excited about!
Here!
He-he was with me umm, we're playing a little game, y'know? Hide and seek.
What happened?
Okay.
I think she's gonna be the hit of the office, huh? She's gonna be hotter than peasant blouses and A-line skirts. Can I get a blue bow?
Is Rachel here?
Ohh.
Your make-up!
I'll get it.
Oh, forget it, okay?
Yeah?
Oh, why don't you make her one of your little jokes.
What? How come that you don't have to go!
Alright boys, let's eat.
Order a pizza like, 'I forgive you?'
How hot is this?!
Hi.
Thing, yes. Thing.
So it said that by the year 2030, there'll be computers that can carry out the same number of functions as an actual human brain. So theoretically we could download our thoughts and our memories into this computer...
This is so cool. You're actually gonna be on television.
No.
All yours.
Getting married. Okay. Okay. You can, you can do that too! Just like you've done everything else!
Yes it is too slutty!
Yeah.
I dunno, there's just something about...
Oh much, much worse. I did my impression of Joan Rivers as one of the earliest amphibians... "Can we walk"? Oh, you... you like that?
No, there is no way he was a velociraptor. No Tony, look at the cranial ridge, OK. If Dino was a velociraptor, he would have eaten the Flintstones. Yeah, yeah. Oh, were you takin' a nap?
Then what am I supposed to do?
Gas? Wow! Intense.
Huh?
Ah.
You're fast and irresponsible. That adds up to a bad driver.
Oh my God.
Ugh, can you believe that guy!
Bye!
No! I balanced my checkbook.
Rings?
You gotta hear this story.
Y'know what? I can easily get out of this, but there is a chance you can get very, very hurt!
Yeah-ha!
I know, I know it was stupid.
My best friend and my sister! I cannot believe this.
Oh, hi! Hi! Thanks for showing you up thirty minutes late!
Monica, uh Dad called this morning and ah, Aunt Silvia passed away.
Hmm? Oh, yeah.
You see, and you thought she'd be judgemental.
Hi Gunther.
Huh?
Hello, Susan. Good shake. Good shake. So, uh, we're just waiting for...?
That sounds great. Same for me.
That would be me.
All right.
Huh?
That that's ridiculous! I don't feel guilty for her failures!
Well, let's say, I don't know, you met someone in the pediatrician's office.
Yes.
So bad.
Then we have to await the data from recent MRI scans and DNA testing which call into question information gathered from years of simple carbon dating.
Oh my God..
Breathe.
Tell you what, maybe one of these weekends you can borrow the car and I cou. . .
Guess where they are?
Veto. Helen?
Hey!
I hope Ben has a little sister.
Okay umm, why don't we all take a seat, y'know? And uh, and I'll get us all some uh some coffees--Yeah, why don't you. Uh and you guys can talk about whatever, whatever you want. Y'know? Whatever pops into your head.
Me neither, okay? We are - we're done being stupid.
Smaller than that.
Well I told you it was Chandler who was smoking the pot but it was me. I'm sorry.
Okay! You guys are getting married tomorrow and-and I couldn't be more thrilled for both of you, but as Monica's older brother I-I have to tell you this. If you ever hurt my little sister, if you ever cause her any unhappiness of any kind, I will hunt you down, and kick your ass! What? I'm-I'm-I'm serious! Come-Hey! Dude! Stop it! Okay? I'm-I'm not kidding here!
No suds? Excuse me, hold on a second. That's my friend's machine.
Ask them if it would be faster if we cut the baby's face off the penis, so we can put it on the bunny. . That is a weird sentence!
There you go.
Okay.
Look, if she's talking to it, I just think that I should get some belly time too. Not that I believe any of this.
No, no, Carol. There's nothing wrong with it. I just, I just don't think breast milk is for adults.
Hey, y'know what and if you're looking for a place? I just heard in the elevator this morning that a woman in my building died.
Yeah.
Uh, you're not gonna win.
Okay.
Linda Clickclocken. So what uh, what-what table are you at? Oh, uh me too.
Did you hear that? Kori Weston had a crush on me!!
Yeah. So...
Yeah.
Oh, I hate this story.
Hey.
Uh-huh.
What?! What does he want?! I wasn't doing anything!
Need some help?
Ohh.
Yeah!
No, no, no, I'm sure you have a great excuse, wh-was it a hair appointment, a mani-pedi or was there a sale at Barney's?
Really?
Rach, have you never done this before?
Yeah!!
Well, I'm not going to go now anyway .
What?!
Oh, okay.
Alright, alright. We're all adults here, there's only one way to resolve this. Since you saw her boobies, I think, uh, you're gonna have to show her your peepee.
No! Hey, you know what? I'm sorry. I would never force you... to hire someone you were this uncomfortable with...
Look, don't blame us. You guys coulda been there, you know.
Rachel please! That is so inappropriate!
What?
Hey!
How about all the way.
We are four short of a bush-o . God I feel so alive, I love being in the country!
...Now that was fun.
Nooo!! Gandolf?! Gandolf is coming to town?
Well, I-I want to give her another chance, y'know? She lives so close. And, at the end of the date, the other time, she-she said something that was-if she was kidding was very funny. On the other hand, if she wasn't kidding, she's not fun, she's stupid, and kind of a racist.
There's other stuff too.
Ah Joey, I don't think you get to pick the cities.
This was just a drunken mistake and I need to get it annulled.
Oh, I uh, I mean, I... dude, I spent the whole conference with Charlie.
Hey Rach...
Oh, yeah. Emma's doing great.
Julie. Julie. That. Oh God. Julie, right. OK, I need to lie down. No, ya know, I'm gonna stand. I'm gonna stand, I'm gonna walk, I'm walkin' and I am standing. OK so you uh, and now wha... and now, now, now you're over me?
The only thing I understand is; postponing it is not an option. This is when we're getting married.
Look at you! You're up!
Bumpy?
That's what it seemed like.
Come on, come on. Damnit, damnit, damnit, damnit. This is all your fault. This is supposed to be, like, the greatest day of my life, y'know? My son is being born, and I should be in there, you know, instead of stuck in a closet with you.
How are you?
Hi.
What?
What? Are you going back to work?
Wo-wo-whoa. What about Phoebe's birthday?
Yeah? Wow! It looks really violent!
Look, look, there's got to be a way we can work past this. Okay, I can't imagine, I can't imagine my life without you. Without, without these arms, and your face, and this heart. Your good heart Rach, and, and....
Oh. Uh, by the way, if it makes you feel any better. I happen to like 8-year-old boys.
Come on, Rachel, come on! Talk to me! Please!!
What?! What?! Talking about what?!
Yeah, thanks.
Oh thanks!
Absolutely. Just give me your breast and we'll be on our way.
Is there a hopping bonus?
Focus.
Oh, just planning my bachelor party with my best man.
Stopped for a Chunky.
It's my joke.
Ewwww!!
Y'know, she tried to undress me too.
They're still, they're still not coming on man and the lotion and the powder have made a paste!
Uh, yeah, you sure you want to after what happened at their 20th?
It tastes like feet!
Hey.
Hey
I know if you were getting married I'd feel, kinda..... y'know.
Hey.
Carol our sex life is-it's just not working...
Hey, does anybody want to get some lunch? All those in favor say I?
Hi.
You were trying to eat it!
You grow up.
Well, I just spoke to Carol. Ben's got the chicken pox.
Hey.
No! No sir umm, she means a lot to me. I mean, I care-I-I love Rachel.
Yeah, it's-it's tough being single. That's why I'm so glad I found Amanda.
In fact, I'll bet you 50 bucks that you can't go the whole year without making fun of us. Eh, y'know what, better yet? A week.
No, no, no, no. Tick, tick, tick, tick.
Yeah, well.
Hey, Mon.
And now you want that money back.
Hi Tushie.
Are you angry at me because I said your handwriting is childlike?
Hey!
Okay. Honey?
Y'know what, 100 million people went to see a movie about what I do, I wonder how many people would go see a movie called, Jurassic Parka.
Wait, wait, You're mad at me about last night? I was just trying to do the right thing.
Okay, I'm gonna play my sperm card one more time.
Correct. Chandler was how old when he first touched a girl's breast?
And hey, here's to a lousy Christmas.
What?! What?! Rach what?!
What?
Hey!
Oh my god. You are pure evil.
Carol's pregnant.
So?
Yeah. Yeah, it really was. But we...we gotta be careful. We...we can't let that happen again, y'know?
What?! That's not gonna make you any money!
Well, Kathy gets half-naked and simulates sex with a real good lookin' guy.
Hey, Rach, you know what? I think, I think I know what'll make you feel better. How 'bout you make a list about me.
I've got to talk to her. Ugh, I hate this part.
I uh, I just got back from uh, from Julie's.
Two seconds...
So honey, this morning was fun, huh? Me hopping in on you in the shower there.
Oh no-no-no!
Hey!
How much did you pay for that?
No, I mean it's okay, I mean, they're-they're my friends. In fact, I-I-I was married to one of them.
Uh, good news everyone, we finally found a nanny. This is Molly . Molly, Chandler, Joey.
Easy.
This... this is exactly what I'm talking about. What kind of a guy makes... makes... delicate French cookies, huh? They're not even... butch, manly cookies with... with... you know with... with chunks.
Oh what?! Is she gonna cancel on me again?! How can she do this? Doesn't she know it's our anniversary?
Excuse me. Hi, I'm a professor here. Do you know the Paleontology section, fifth floor, stack 437?
Okay. Sure.
Um, that is because my doctor says that I have a very serious.... nuget.... diffency.
What?!
Hiiii-Ya!! I'm serious! You're not walking out on my sister!
I'm meeting with professor Sherman about my being the keynote speaker...
Hi Rachel! Here's your sister Amy! She thinks I need pec implants!
I think when someone steals your credit card, they've kind of already thrown caution to the wind.
She doesn't know what to say!
Am I?!
Yeah, I need uh... I'm just-I don't know-I don't understand, umm, how this happened? We-we used a condom.
Yeah!!!! Yes, I made it! I'm on time! Okay, why don't we all uh, open our books to page 23. Where... Where you will see...a uh...a bunch of uh...red spots. Okay, umm, why don't, why don't you all start to read, while I-
Yeah, I recognize the ankles!
Yeah.
Well, he had gravity boots.
Hey, don't we have to...
Oh, come on, every first time mother feels that way. You'll-you're gonna pick it up. Hey! You will! Uh look, y'know when you first came to the city? You were this spoiled helpless little girl who-who still used daddy's credit card. Do you remember?
Okay, gimme my monkey back.
This year was supposed to be great! But, it's only the second day and I'm a loser with stupid leather pants that don't even fit!
Well we...we don't have a garage.
Noo. Why?
What, so he was a little analytical. That's what he does, y'know? C'mon, he's not that bad.
You like it right?
We're still married! Don't tell Rachel. See you later.
Look, just because some idiot drew on your face doesn't mean you shouldn't have any fun! Okay? And besides, hey-hey-hey no one is even gonna look at you. Okay? This is Vegas! Hello! There are tons of other freaks here! There are tons...of...freaks here. No other. No. Come on! No one will notice, I swear!
It was soo not an accident. She saw I was about to tag her, so she threw her big fat grandma arm elbow right into my face. And just keep running.
Carol?
You really think so?
Well, do you wanna marry him?
Yeah I just hurt it.
Hey guys!
Sure. Yeah.
Damnit!
You let Rachel come back, and it's done.
I-I just thought you were doing so well. I...
Okay I-I just have to stop by my place first.
Uh, actually, we're getting a cat.
SON OF A BITCH! Oh relax! I didn't say the 'F' word!
Hi, hi, I'm Ross Geller.
The gas is odorless, but they add the smell so you know when there's a leak.
No more falafel for you!
Hi!
I'm divorced! I'm only 26 and I'm divorced!
You're good. These are not.
Hi. Mom. Dad.
You don't want my opinion?
I'm gonna stop you right there, Glenda. Okay? Does it look like this is my first time, huh? Now I want 4 two's... and I want them all on my back.
Hi, I was wondering if it is possible to increase security in the Paleontology section? See I-I wrote a book up there and instead of reading it people are-are-are well, rolling around in front of it.
So-so what did the doctor say?
Everybody put their balloons down!!! Now this is a nice suit!!
Absolutely.
Oh my God, Phoebe, slow down!
You know what I don't care. The only person I cared about getting dressed, is the one person that says she's not even gonna go. Look Rach, I'm sorry. Okay. Look, I-I wa, I was a jerk. I'm sorry I yelled. I want you there, I need you there. Look, what, what can I do that can show you how much, how much I want you to be there.
Oh, man. Oh, remember when I stuck that broom in your bike spokes, and you flipped over and hit your head on the curb?
What? What? What?!! Well they should put that on the box!!!
What?
A-a-and... record.
I knew it. So, is she someone from work?
What? We're never gonna make it!
There's this kid in my class who said he's in love with me.
Ahh, no, I'm good.
Because what's going on with Rachel has nothing to do with how I feel about you.
Great. Thanks!
What?
Who isn't?
Dude, you are sick.
All I have to do is close my eyes. See? Woo-hoo!!
I will, I will. See, I'm waiting for the right moment. What? What, now?
Naa. A while ago I got a sah out of him, which I thought, ya know, might turn into sah-condary caregiver but... Hey, would you uh, would you hold him for a sec, 'cause I, I gotta take this off.
Monica's pregnant!
Food.
"...subcategories. The first of these subcategories is..."
What?
Oh, but-but it is, uh, it's just like the first Thanksgiving, when the Indians and the Pilgrims uh, sat down to dinner.
So, Dr. Green, how's the old boat.
C'mon, just tell me, please, please.
Hi! Hey mom.
Listen Adrienne, you can't tell Chandler about this.
Hi Julie.
No, I'm getting back down 'cause she lives in Poughkeepsie. She seems really great, but she's like totally great, but she lives two and a half hours away.
What, what oh....
No, you know, it's uhm... nothing you did, it's... it's uhm... my issue.
Ugh. Well, we're just gonna have to jump. Yeah. Now, we're gonna have to make sure to land to the right of that patch of ice, okay? Not hit the dumpster on the other side and uh, and try to avoid that-that weird brownish red stuff in the middle. So, when you get down there...you go up to the roof and you let me in.
What's the part, Anti-man?
There never was a library. I mean there are libraries, its just that I ah, I never worked at one.
I just Bamboozled Chandler! Which is not uh sexual thing. That was a quick shower.
Listen, I um... I heard about the engagement.
It's all working out! Me & Charlie, and you two. You know what we should do?
I prefer not to answer that right now, I'm still carrying a little holiday weight.
Mma, Mma, Mmaah
Hey!
It's a blanket Joe, not a cloak of invisibility!
Rain? Hi. Hi, my name is Rain. I have my own kiln, and my dress is made out of wheat.
Okay. Um, how about these?
It's a good thing I didn't do it, because it sounds like it would've been a very expensive wedding. Okay, good night.
That'll be a neat trick, when you're, when you're dead!
Santa was unavailable so close to Christmas.
Okay, okay, okay. I'll get the bagels.
Okay. Um... is he a good guy?
Yeah, yeah, oh!
Hi, Julie. Hi, Julie. Julie, um, how are you?
Okay, go left. Left! Left!
Hey-hey, or I could bring my keyboard over here sometime!
No. No. No, I'm-I'm glad you did. Look, if nothing else, it's-it's always great when someone tells you they love you.
Do they wait for me to do this?
That's romantic.
Rachel! I'll just call her back.
Yes, yes it is. In prison! Whatsa matter with you?
Okay.
Um, see, but that's not the final draft.
Yep.
Well this uh, this may be a little awkward.
No no, no no, it's not flashy, not for a Goodfella.
Uhm... Rachel and I hired a male nanny.
Okay!!
Monica!
Dysprosium? Try mendelevium.
All right!
Fine, fine, Rachel your with Monica, Joey you're with me.
Thanks.
What?!
I'm telling you, there's no way he's moving back.
Uh-huh.
Oh my God, she's great! I mean, we-we have so much in common and she's just cool, and funny...
No?
Hey, would it be okay if I wrote a song about this.
Yeah.
Yeah, he's head of the department.
Look, I just think you're an adult, okay? And you should get over your silly fears.
Rock on! Phoebe : Wow, this is quite a spread! What is all this stuff?
Hey!
Hi.
Monica!
Rach, she's got like three hairs!
No!
Come on. You gotta help me figure out what to do. Okay?
Joey, Homo Sapiens are people.
Yeah?
Oh Ross Geller.
All right. Y'know what? We don't have to go downstairs! We can bring Vegas up to us! All right, come on, come on, we'll play some blackjack. Here we go. 13.
Nope.
Rach! Rach!
Okay, see ya later.
Mona umm...Clickclocken. The famous botanist? Huh? Oh no she's uh-well she's dead now. No, supposedly she was once quite the hottie of the plant world.
We can still catch that Ukrainian film.
Home is Home Star stew.
No, no, really, I've got to take the car back anyway, I'm spending all day tomorrow with Ben, It's fine, no guilt I promise.
No, God no! That is no place for a woman. Those guys will grab anything.
Well, it matters to me.
Really. It's always been you, Rach.
What?
What? What?
Thanks.
That's okay, I'm not so crazy about myself right now either.
So Pheebs, how long is your mom gonna be with us?
Just please stop!
And you told Phoebe you were engaged.
No, that's, no, as long as you're okay. So I'll ah, I'll see you tomorrow.
Which is fine! Because you just turned--twenty-eight!
Look Carol umm, I was, I was thinking maybe uh, maybe we can spice things up a little.
No, I can't. I would, I really would, but my son is here; I can't leave him. Isn't-you don't think there's any way?
Yeah, sure, right! Like I've ever been in Rachel Green's room.
Every day is Lesbian Lover Day.
Yeah.
MY SANDWICH?!!!
You're welcome for a delicious dinner.
Okay!
What? Hey, hey, listen..
Listen, Roland Chang, if things go well, I'm gonna be out with her all night.
Oh-ho, whoa! Sorry, Tommy. I almost spilled this hot coffee on you.
Action.
Uh yeah, I guess-Yeah! I guess so.
Yeah!
OK, I have a question. Well, actually, it's not so much a question as.. more of a general wondering... ment.
What?!
Sit down.
Come on, let's go!
Whatever dude, you kissed a guy.
Yeah, marriage... stinks! I mean if you wanna see a man gain weight and a woman stop shaving? Get them married.
Uh actually, there-there was also that exchange student from Thailand but I-I don't think he-he knew what it was.
Hello! Oh, sorry.
10 seconds, you need this or you lose the game.
Hey!
Fine, she can stay at my place. By the way, what-what does Cassie even look like now.
What are you, what are you doing?
Huh?
Hey guys, does anybody know a good date place in the neighborhood?
I'm not freaking out, I'm just saying, if somebody had come to me with the idea andndash;
So uh, have a great time down there.
Please, please stay with me. I am so in love with you. Please, don't go.
Hi! I could help not notice, but that's an unusual necklace.
Hey, there's Missy Goldberg. You gotta remember her.
It's-it's hot...
Yeah, well.
No really, I-I am! I feel bad!
That's, that's nice twice!
Okay, I'll have the fixed salad and the duck.
A wandering?
Hey. Uh, Chan, can I uh, can I talk to you for a second?
Dad!!
Oh, really!
Hi.
I'm getting married today!! Whoo-hoo!!
When did I say you were boring?!
Come on, Pheebs lay off him.
Okay. Well, you be careful.
Ahh, the one next to my foot. Sorry.
Right, you're not even getting your honeymoon, God.. No, no, although, Aruba, this time of year... talk about your- -big lizards... Anyway, if you don't feel like being alone tonight, Joey and Chandler are coming over to help me put together my new furniture.
Yeah? Okay.
Yeah, y'know the ah, the girlfriend I told you about last night? Well it turns out she ah, she wants to get back together with me. Oh, I found it!!
Hey, Joey.
Oh I'm, I'm making this too hard. Okay, what do you want me to do.
I've been thinking, this is crazy, I mean don't, don't you think we can work on this?
The small one.
What big thing?
Okay, for instance. Let's say, Janice is coming back from a trip and she gives you two options. Option number 1 she'll take a cab home from the airport. Option 2 is you can meet her at baggage claim. Which do you do?
What? A brain transplant?!
No why?
I uh, went to a bar. And then I just uh, just walked around for a while.
Hey, what are you doing?
Yeah. I'm paying you to stop.
Just one thing umm...
Hey.
Okay. Now-now-now should I climb down your front so we're face to face or-or should I climb down your back so we're-we're butt to face.
Because he called here looking for you. So don't tell me this...this kissing this guy from work is a one time thing,ok? You've been out there in bars and on balconies for over a month now. And you didn't even have the courtesy to tell me.
Oh. Thanks. Uh, has anyone seen Rach?
Yeah!!
To be fair, he doesn't seem to be impersonating Fonzie...
Well, I said it loud.
No. Now maybe.
Yeah that's what she said.
Well? Isn't that amazing?
Oh! Y'know, I've got an extra futon.
That's right!
Ugh. It's definitely getting worse.
Oh, and Chandler and I have this stupid college alumni thing. I can't believe you get to meet Donny Osmond.
Why are they here?
One night, just-just sex. No strings attached?
Yeah.
Because there are naked ladies there.
Same difference.
Umm, I don't some Italian guy. Come on, read your own label. See you later.
You have a line down your face.
You're livin' the dream.
Oh, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah...
Ah, Cheryl!
Look, I really need some help, okay? Why? Why did I have to speak in a British accent?! What do I do?
Dad?
I am!
I.....got.....dressed. Really, really quickly. Okay, okay. There we go, there we go.
Oh God, no.
No Rach! Come on! No-no! Yeah, I'm sure we won't get arrested for this.
Yeah.
Are you wearing two belts?
Great, how did it go?
No! No, I won't! I'll be at the bottom of the dating barrel now. The only guys below me will be Four Divorce Guy uh, Murderer Guy, and-and, Geologists.
No. Sorry man.
I know! And-and the worst part was they took my backpack which had all the original artwork I had done for my own comic book: "Science Boy"
How can you not believe in evolution?
The data we are receiving from MRI scans and DNA testing of these fossils are - are staggering.
Oh, well he's obviously late and the rule in my class is "if you can't come on time, then don't come at all". An option that many of my students use. Shall we?
Hey.
Because, because I've got Ben.
Oh no-no-no! Oh-no! No! No! Emily!
Are you kidding?
Yeah? How much?
Are you kidding?
C'mon, seriously, Joey, what's the part?
Oh my God! Those weren't albino kids, that was computer camp! Rach!
Why, why you do, like with the-the toe separators?
What a beautiful story. Hey, I'm fine by the way.
Hello.
Okay, good bye!
Oh well I may as well have!
Yeah?
What, that we had a baby? Come on let's give him a little credit, although, he did eat a piece of plastic fruit earlier.
A little bit.
Congratulations!
Oh, come on, Rach, he's a guy!
Yeah!
I got tenure. I didn't win the lottery... Hey Rach, so uh... how did your thing go?
Wha... What? What would give you that idea?
Come here, come here. Uh, ow! Emily, will you marry me?
Correct. Rachel claims this is her favorite movie...
Alright, alright, now-now who should I say tricked me into doing it?
I can do that. Oh-oh, what if she gets upset?
No, I tried that. She says it has a weird smell.
Can I have everyone's attention please? I'm uh; I'm Ross Geller.
Congratulations!/Good for you!/Great!
Fine.
Celebrities I'm allowed to sleep with.
Well, I'm a spud...
Uh, what?
Yeah...
C'mon, you'll make a day of it! You'll rent a boat, pack a lunch...
And that's bad because..., you hate chicken piccata?
Oh-oh-okay, but-but I know, that even though I've been a-a complete idiot up 'til now, I mean, I mean you-you-you have to come here. You have to come here so we can work this out.
Not for the next few minutes.
What?
Yeah, yeah. You should come check us out. We're called "Way! No Way!".
Joey?! Joey!!
That guy Lipson?
Coffee sounds great. Wait, so, so you live in Montreal?
I don't know, I don't get, I don't get it, I mean, wh, wh, two months ago Rachel and I were like, this close. Right now, what, I'm takin messages from guys she, she meets at the movies? I mean this, this Casey should be takin' down my messages, ya know, or, or, Rachel and I should be together and, and we should get some kind of me, message service.
And that's funny, why?
Yeah, Sarah, anything.
Not just restaurants, from our house.
What?
O is for "oh, wow!" The V is for this very surprising turn of events, which I'm still fine with by the way. E is for how extremely normal I find it. That you two are together. And now one day you might get married and have children of your own.
Oh that is so great! That's...
What happened?
Rachel and I are bringing Emma to Ralph Lauren today to introduce her to everyone. Doesn't she look cute?
Eh, if it was meant to be, it's meant to be.
Of course it's your friend Tanya.
But all kidding aside, in much the same way that Homo ergaster is now thought to be a separate species from Homo erectus...
And it'll be cool to see it again! Yeah!
Yeah! yeah, I got tenure!
Oh great! That means I'm stuck with, "So, we were watching you in there and you were sittin' right here! Whoa!"
Yeah.
Thank you! That's what I keep saying.
Wow! Thanks, you guys. That's uh-ohhh, I wanna, I wanna play you another piece! Umm! Uh-oh! I left my uh, helicopter sounds on another disk. I'll be right back! Okay? This is so nice, I'm-I am so...
You're never gonna believe it uh, Monica and Chandler are moving in again. That's great news right-I mean for them. Right?
Oh my God!
Hey!
Is that Mark?
You have to tell her! You have to tell her! It's your moral obligation, as a friend, as a woman, I think it's a feminist issue! Guys? Guys?
I know! Don't switch hands, okay?
As my lawfully wedded wife, in sickness and in health, until death parts us. Really, I do. Emily.
Yes, we have to tell her!
What?
Well I'm, I'm a little slow. Just as our children would be.
Yeah, hey I-I have clothes, I even pick them out. I mean for, for all you know I could be a fashion..... monger.
Wow! Kind of uh, kind of a full house here. I'll guess just...I'll come back.
Yeah!
Yes. Yes. Just here and there .
You uh, you may have been right about Jill.
Here's an idea. You walk into a room...take a quick scan!
Wh- are you welling up?
I- I think they're great! I, I really do.
Wha, OK, now how do you know that?
Eh-wh-Excuse me?
Looks like a fun gang.
Look I was going to tell you!
Na-huh.
Underwear, a toothbrush, and Van Halen CD. I can use all these things!!
For real?
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Did you know Chandler kissed Rachel?
Got me.
Wow, Rhonda.
So, you're not going to Paris.
Oh, but it's a kind game! So we're a little late, you know, the girls will be there, let's stay just for one more goal.
Yeah, no one talks like that!
You know, I think thats a great idea. It'll be like the pilgrims bringing the Indians syphilis.
Uh, actually these might look pretty good on me.
Oh, I was unbelievable.
Way!
Well, maybe the crazy fog has lifted and she realises that life without me.... a-sucks.
Answer better, answer better!
Hmph. So what you, you tell each other everything?
Are you sure?
And um...You look nice today.
Yeah, yeah.
So, what are you gonna do?
I don't, I don't understand. I mean, you, it's like we can't win with you guys.
OK, tip the man.
Hi Jill.
Ohh, I-I see lotion, I have lotion! Will that work?
Okay, Joey, you know what? You have to go for it. How often does this happen to you, huh? You owe it to yourself.
Sure, go ahead. Whoops, sorry, sure, go ahead.
Okay!
Why?
Hi! Hi, I'm Ross, you don't know me, but I'm a big, big fan of yours. I mean, Blue Velvet, woo-oo hoo! Um, I was wondering if I could um, maybe buy you a cup of coffee? Or maybe reimburse you for that one?
Of course.
Oh, please. Sweetie it's hopeless, okay, I'm just gonna go.
I think I know too but I've been really wrong about this stuff in the past, so...
What about Ben?
I know, I know, it's, it's almost... What do you say we go take a walk, just us, not them?
Here's my retainer!
That's Ben, my son from my first marriage.
Well that stinks. I was looking forward to us wearing our celebrity tuxes together.
I'm really glad we came. You're so pretty. I love you.
Oh, no! No!
Hi!
Yeah, you're right.
I'm not gonna hit you.
Susan Sarandon.
And she's supposed to buy this?!
Uberveiss. It's new, it's German, it's extra-tough.
This is beautiful!
Really?
You know, if it's meant to be, I'll guess it. Bye, bye.
yeah I really, really need to talk to you about something.
Do you think if the Ralph Lauren people offered her her old job back, she would take it?
Hey Pheebs, what's going on?
Because it's breast milk. It's gross.
Okay. He was more embarrassed about that than anyone. Okay? And for him to have the courage to walk back in here like nothing happened...
Oh sure, come here! Sure you can! Uh, look come here look, it's-it's-it's, it's right there .
Ah, he didn't uh, take it so well?
Not you.
Well, I guess I can check out those apartment listings, even though there's never anything in here.
That's all right, we-we don't need you. In fact, hey I'm over it already.
What?
Excuse me, do any of you know how to play?
Well Mr. Big Shot is better than 'wethead'.
G'night.
Mon, Mon, are you OK?
Hey, wait! Wait-wait-wait! Joey, did you propose to her?
What's going on?
No!!
Do you realise we almost made it ten years without that coming up?
Hey Pheebs, you gonna have the rest of that Pop-Tart?.. Pheebs?
Yeah.
That's funny. Yeah. Y'know you're the funniest man here in a pink bunny costume his wife made him wear.
Hey!
Uh sweetie, maybe you'd be more comfortable here?
And if you think about it, I mean the reason he memorized all that stuff is because he thought it was important to you. You know, that's the kind of guy Joey is.
Bye Marcel. See ya on the big screen. You keep people drinkin' that beer, OK. I miss you buddy.
I am not unemployed. I'm on sabbatical!
Really!
What is that?
Wow! It actually is in the handbook. I can't date you or have a hot plate in my office. I can't believe we have to stop seeing each other.
Yes! Santa's coming!
Oh, thanks Gunther. STUPID BRITISH SNACK FOOD!!!!!!!
Why-why would I care about that?
OH NO!
Oh, better, actually. Y'know I-I-I think I finally figured out why we were having so much trouble lately.
Hi there. How many, how many ah, did you sell?
So, he's just a nice guy. You really think this Mark doesn't want anything in exchange for helping him?
Uh-huh.
Hmmm-mmmm.
I will, I will find him.
You know what? You know what? If, things were the other way around, there's nothing you could put on a list that would ever make me not want to be with you.
...nauseous, I'm physically nauseous. What am I supposed to do, huh? Call immigration? I could call immigration!
Of course I am. I just have to make a call.
Surely you can think of something good.
What, woah, woah, $3500 at porcelain safari?
I know. That's why I did it. Come on, are they really that bad?
Hello!
We uh, we just cooked it up.
Pop it in.
They're towing your car, they're towing your car!!
Shut up.
He won't? He won't! Because, isn't that, isn't that the, the short story you were writing?
I picked up the divorce papers. Uh, I've already signed everything and I put little 'X's where you need to sign.
Emily?!
Thank you.
Listen, if you ever have any problem with the ladies you know I'll help you out.
Well I, I don't know. Why?
Uh, yeah, yeah I'll, I'm right behind you.
Nope.
What?
So, so now do I get Joey?
So it's really a question of who could you have possibly done.
Oh wow, yeah! See, I did not get that.
Well I have to. Okay? If I don't, they'll take the class away from me. And...I already put it in my family newsletter.
Oh my God!
Okay, listen I am not a pervert!
We got a head, we got shoulders, we got arms, we got, oh, look at the little fingers, oh, and a chest, and a stomach. It's a boy, definitely a boy! All right! Ok, legs, knees, and feet. Oh, oh. He's here. He's a person.
Well hey! What's going on? Ooh, cool boat--Oh, no. Hey, did you, did you tell them?
People can hear you.
Well I'm thinking that Chandler's our friend and Janice makes him happy, so I say we just all be adult about it and accept her.
What happened?
...everyone, this is Chandler!
Yeah! Yes! Thank you! This is great. Thank you so much. And I swear, your kid is going to have the time of his life.
Hello.
Yeah, well, m-maybe you're right.
Well maybe it's cold in there. Or maybe I screwed up the first date I had in 9 years.
Yes, that's what I was going to ask, thank you.
Will!
Rach, come on, if you think about it, it's actually kinda funny. Okay, maybe it's best not to think about it.
All right, there you go!
Susan...
No! No! No! The "Come here to me" is y'know for the ladies.
Monica!
Who's this little guy?
Come on, show them to me.
Yeah Pheebs, come on, you two have completely different styles. Y'know, she's more.. y'know, and you're more
So uh, where's Monica?
I do. I do. I do.
'Kay!
I'm here.
Fine! Fine! Y'know what? Whatever you want. Okay? You're the mommy.
Oh thank God, I thought she had two heads.
Hello!
Turns out them Emily is just crazy about Susan. Yeah, they're going to the theatre together! They're going to dinner! They're going horseback riding!
I guess it could.
Oh hi! Hello! Uh, have you come to ask me some more paleontology related questions? Uhm... your grandmother's nickname, perhaps? Aunt Margaret's pants size?
And to love. Ah, love. L-O-V-E, love. L is for life. And what is life without love?
Yeah, I know, so what? I mean, who's-who's to say? Does that me we-we can't do it? Look, huh, I was with Carol for four years before we got married and I wound up divorced from a pregnant lesbian. I mean, this, this makes sense for us. Come on! I mean, on our first date we ended up spending the whole weekend in Vermont! I mean, last night I got my ear pierced! Me! This feels right. Doesn't it?
Chandler. When did he... when did he... when did he?
What the hell was that?!
She's not Rachel.
Are you kidding?
All we're saying is don't rush into anything.
I don't see why not.
Well then that's it. And if George and Adelaide can't accept that, then the hell with them. Look, if my parents didn't want me to marry you, no way that would have stopped me. Look, this is your wedding. Do it.
Yeah, that's true. Except I don't wanna get over her.
Funny story!
Yeah, save it for the cab, okay.
What?!
So really, what'd ya have?
You had no right to tell me you ever had feelings for me.
Pheebs, you mind if I speak to Rachel alone for a sec?
I talked to Monica, look, I'm the one who made the choice. I'm the one who's making things change, so I should be the one to y'know, step back.
Oh, I don't, I don't, I don't know...
Thanks. I-I think I'm dying. I really do.
Come on, man! Just-just take the sweats off. Okay? Just take 'em off and we'll have some fun.
A basket of mini-muffins.
Hey.
No!! Y'know-y'know don't do me any favours. In fact, where, where's the rest of my stuff?! Huh? Like-like my umm, Hey, this book is mine!! And-and-and, and that T-shirt you sleep in? I'd like that back too. Yes, I do.
Okay, how about you flew to London to stop my wedding! Ah, how about you told me you loved me after I was already married!
Sorry.
Yeah, either that, or he has a really big cat.
Look, would you guys grow up? That is the most natural beautiful thing in the world.
Oh, I'm sorry, no. He did ask me one. Uhm... How do you spell Mboscodictiosaur?
Oh, be-because of the leather pants.
Ok, but you know what? I gotta say, I'm really impressed that you were able to memorize all this so quickly!
OH MY GOD!
I don't know, God, I... well, it's not like she's a regular mom, y'know? She's, she's sexy, she's...
I take it.
MY SANDWICH!!!!!!
I don't know, something girlie.
Huh? Yeah! Yes, of course!
Perhaps. Now I'm curious, at what point during those girlish screams would you have begun to kick my ass?
It's okay if he bumps his head, kids bump their heads all the time, y'know, it was your first time babysitting, I figured you did the best you could.
Not two years in a row.
Gotcha.
Hell yeah!
Uhh, believe me when he's older, he'll understand.
No! The reason I'm asking is that... I sorta had one last night.
We got honourable mention in the brother/sister dance category! Look, it's almost fake midnight, do we really have any other choice?
Wait! No! Ben, come here! I am not kidding!
So you guys having any luck getting rid of the entertainment center?
Hey, I don't know what to tell you guys that's the doll he chose.
If you wanna put a label on it.
All right I've been feeling incredibly guilty about this, because I wanna be a good friend, and dammit I am a good friend. So just, just shut up and close your eyes .
...and then, we could've gone from the ceremony to the reception with you in the sidecar!
Why?
Great to see you!
The card! I think we're there!
You do, huh?
What do I know? I just sell Middle Eastern food from a cart!
OH! SON OF A BITCH!
She already lives in London.
Rachel, I've seen you naked a million times. I ate hot fudge off you naked. Remember, I-I sucked that mini-marshmallow out of your belly button?
I gotta go find her.
A little.
Okay. I did divert her and we ended up having a great time! Okay?
No Chandler, everything! Like stuff you like, stuff she likes, technique, stamina, girth....
Uh, actually mom, I think Monica thanked him for the both of us.
Really. It's always been you, Rach.
He left that.
Hey.
Oh, come in.
Yes. I mean, it's what we always planned. And if you have a plan, you should stick to it. That's why they call them plans. Hello? I'm fine.
No, 19.
Oh really? Did she tell you he plays the recorder, recites poetry and bakes Madeleines?
What did you get?
Emily is...incredible. I mean there-there are no words to describe it, I mean the whole weekend was like a dream. Oh! And you! Rach!
Yeah, no problem.
What, uh... what were you thinking?
Look you're my wife. We're-we're married. Y'know? I-I love you. I-I really miss you.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What makes you think we're gonna break up?
Wow! Really?!
Yeah!
Aww! Chi-Chi! Oh, I loved this dog! Y'know Monica couldn't get braces because Chi-Chi needed knee surgery.
Done! With time a-to-spare.
Try to understand!
Hey!
Good morning.
Yeah, the phone was facing the other way. And that goes back up there.
It is. Eventually, it kind of... burns out. But hopefully, what you're left with is trust, and security, and... well, in the case of my ex-wife, lesbianism. So, you know, for all of those people who miss out on that passion... thing, there's all that other good stuff.
That's right good things, that-that is what I said.
I'd lead with that. Monica: That's it, just sign right on the bra .
Mee mee, mee-mee mee.
Well, I'm so excited about this.
What? What? What?
Oh my God!
No, no, no, no, no, I don't want to know, absolutely not. I think, you know, I think you should know until you look down there, and say, oop, there it is! Or isn't...
Oh, great. Great. There was a projectile, uh, throwing up incident, but he started it.
Well, that's because you're such a sweet, gentle, uh...Do you, uh, do you...Oh, hey, uh you must need detergent.
I don't think so.
So uh, Emily just went to the airport.
Hi.
Yes! No-no! I know, I know what the list is! Mom! Look if you see Chandler, could you just let him know I'm looking for him?
Oh, it was, nah, well....
Well, I'm, uh, going to pick up Mona. What have you got going tonight?
And, I don't know, if it starts to rain...
Oh no! An asteroid!
So?
Four hundred, huh? Well, that sounds do-able. How much are the boxes?
Good.
Go? Why?
Oh really? What uh, what does he want with her?
Damnit!
Oh, just this woman that I met last night at the party.
Sorry.
Happy New Year, Pheebs!
Nothing! What do you say to that?
Okay, hold my crawler.
That doesn't sound like you... That's Monica talking!
You know, I hate to lecture you guys, but it's kinda disgraceful, that a group of well-educated adults and Joey can't name all the states. Did you ever see a map, or one of those round, colorful things called "a globe?" Hmm?
Hate him? I... No, I don't hate him. It's just it's Rachel, y'know?
I was saving you.
Anyway, she thought the very idea of me playing rugby with him was like hilarious. So I'm gonna show her how tough I really am!
Why are we in bed together?
No, we're not.
I dunno, it's weird. I mean, I know she's gone, but I just don't feel, uh...
No, it's really not that bad. I mean, I-I for one, feel perfectly safe.
What?
Yeah, that's her.
Alright. There's a theory, put forth by Richard Leakey-
I'm gonna, I'm gonna go to London and I'm going to fight for her.
I'm sure he'll understand.
What?
Wow! The only thing I got from my Grandmother was her eyes. I mean not-not her actual eyeballs, but, but people say that my eyes-Do-do you want to make out?
Yeah, you got it right? You got it right? You got it?
About the yelling.
Can I use.. either thumb?
So, listen guys, are we uh, are we ok here?
Okay. What ah, what is the matter with you? What's going on?
Umm-hmm.
Listen. Oh hey, hey, the important thing was that she meant, she meant nothing to me!
Well, last weekend...
This is not good for my rage.
Yeah, okay.
That's interesting, but check this out. I date her...
No, I mean, look I don't know if anything is going to happen with us, again. Ever. But I don't want to know that it-it never could. So I stopped it and she got mad and broke my projector.
Tsz... NO! .
Oh, I wish I knew, but the evaluations are all anonymous.
How'd the callback go?
Yeah, I'm gonna go to a doctor who went to school in a mini-mall.
Wha... what, here?
That's a duck.
I'm sorry, it's just... how did you get so tan?
Yeah in fact, I'm gonna go call her right now. And I'll make sure to tell her my friend Chandler says...
Hi. She said yes.
Y'know what I think it is? I think you've made such a nice home for her over the last nine months that she just doesn't want to leave.
Eh, you think? I mean, you went out with a guy who improved the accuracy of radiocarbon dating by a factor of 10!
Okay the sleeping thing. Very tricky business, but there is something you can do.
Monica, Monica, you could come in straddling him, they still wouldn't believe it. We're here.
What? Okay, okay, okay, okay.
Either that or my mouth is getting smaller.
I wanna be buried at sea, it looks like fun.
Aw, he's gonna be so happy.
And sexy.
Well I uh, I skipped forth grade.
It so does not!!!
I'm not going to do that.
Uh, aside from that, the whole evening was pretty much a bust.
Good-good, I'm-I'm married.
Why, does it look like I'm having trouble with my misshapen claw?
Hey Erica, welcome back to town! Wow, look how big you've gotten.
And you had no idea they weren't getting along?
No, no you don't understand the animal hospital is way across town he's choking I don't know what else to do.
Oh! Man I don't think I've seen you since uh, Lance Davis' graduation party.
Okay. Uh, huh. Excuse me, I'm sorry, I-I think you may be in our seats.
Check this out. Five hundred and seventeen boxes!
Dad, she won't want to go with me.
All right.
Wha... what do you mean?
So, uh, this guy, she used to go out with, is, uh... is he still in love with her?
What? That's impossible.
What? No! No! I am not gonna hide it from Phoebe-Ooh, although I did get some great Pottery Barn sheets!
What do you mean?
Hello.
oh yea now um how is that going, is it getting serious?
That, that is funny... .... and Rachel keeps touching him.
So, um... where did Paolo come from?
I know when I'm 90 she'll be like 80 and it won't seem like such a big difference.
Yeah?
How is that important?
Joey, uh- OMnipotent.
She's not even here yet.
How can I not get this? I'm a college professor; I got 1450 on my S.A.T.s.
Ayyyayyyy!
No.
What am I going to do?
Oh hey, don't thank me, thank yourself. You're the one who faced her fears and ultimately overcame them.
And they knew about it?
Look, I know you don't want to hear this right now but, we've seen him in his new place, alright. And he's happy, he's, he's decorated.
Please hurry.
Hi, honey.
Still?!
Well, hello, Mrs. Ross!
Pffhah.
Yes, yes, fine, that is my penis. Can we be grown-ups now?
You're never going to guess who I just saw downstairs!
It really was.
Oh, thank you. Hey, hey. Rachel!!!!
Ben, I want you to know that there may be some times when I may not be around, like this. But I'll still always come back, like this. And sometimes I may be away longer, like this. But I'll still always come back, like this.
Why are you laughing?
And tell them what? The naked guy we stare at all the time isn't moving.
Oh-oh, were you, were you watching?
I know, it's crazy! We were just pushing Ben on the swings...
Hey.
Oh fine.
Um . . . ah . . . you know, I'm divorced. Um, Phoebe, ah . . . Phoebe said you . . . You've been divorced?
Thank you, thank you.
Come on! Joe!
Do you know the word crapweasel?
Yes, yes!
I don't know. What's in this pie?
Hi.
Yeah, he-he's right, he's right. This is your time y'know, yeah, you're young, you're-you're weird, chicks dig that.
Okay umm, bad stuff. Well, I'm-I'm 12 years older than she is.
Boss!
What guys? Oh, yeah.
Ow! Ow! Okay, okay, fine, fine! All right, you wanna win by cheating, go ahead, all right. Phoebe the touchdown does count, you win.
Hey!
Oh, uh, can it wait a second Joey? I have to tell my parents something. No it can't? Okay.
Still thinking about it huh?
Rachel, this is your apartment.
What's up?
So, I'll umm...
Yup! You could plunk me down in the middle of any woman's uterus, no compass, and I can find my way out of there like that!
Right.
Hi.
Y'know, I-I-you've done a lot of stupid stuff too! Okay?
Fajitas! Be careful, very hot plate, very hot plate!!
Um, I do not want her baby-sitting our child.
3 minutes ago!!! I don't know why that's important ...
Great! Great! You're making the bike very happy.
No! No, come on let her sleep! She's so exhausted.
Rachel, I know that you can. And you should.
I was kinda, supposed to be on TV tonight for The Discovery Channel.
Oh my God! You actually exchanged it!
No, it's for when Carol goes into labor. She can get me wherever I am. I mean, all she has to do is to dial 55-JIMBO.
All right, see you guys.
N-no! Okay? We've been through this! We're not gonna get married just because she's pregnant, okay?
No.
Hey Pheebs, maybe this whole heart attack thing is a sign, that-that you should start think about getting a different job.
You know, Barracuda was the first song I learned to play on the keyboard.
Oh umm, there's also a book here by a woman named Wendy Bagina. What is that?
Yeah!
Hey where-where are the pictures that creepy pretzel vendor took of us together?
Mona? What are-hi! What are you doing here? I'm, um, supposed to pick you up!
No-no, he's, he's very docile.
I can't believe you put that on my alumni page!
What's wrong with people having sex?
Now, we'll see.
Come on you guys, we're sorry, alri...? Our subway broke down.
...that you actually...
"Hi Rach, are you there? It's me, pick up. Rachel. Rach!"
Okay, each team will answer ten questions. The first team that answers the most questions wins. Okay, the categories are, Fears and Pet Peeves, Ancient History, Literature, and It's All Relative. Now, the coin toss to see who goes first. Okay, somebody call it this time.
Thank you.
Yeah, she finally stopped crying yesterday, but then she found one of Richard's cigar butts out on the terrace, so.
Are ya?
Yeah, would you please consider moving here? I mean you were gonna move here anyway, why can't you just do that?
No, no, she's great and it's not like we haven't done anything. I mean, uh, uh, we, we do plenty of other stuff, lot's of other stuff, like uhh. . .
Well, Chandler and I are in a bar...
Don't sweat it, I've got this section covered. Yeah, in fact I've got this little baby to shine in people's eye--Okay, see you later.
Oh no-no-no, I'm there.
Hey!
Ahhhh!!
Check again please!
Dude! How-how did you write this?
Hey, what'd you guys do to get up on there?
Come on out, honey! I'm telling you look good! Tell her she looks good, tell her she looks good.
The uh, the baby that hasn't been born yet? Wouldn't that mean you're... crazy?
What?
No, no, no, you can't take the remote control!
October 18th.
OK, I'm gonna go say goodbye to the guys.
You've never said that in your life, have you?
I knew you were gonna throw that in my face!! That was three years ago! She apologized and she apologized! What more do you want?!!
I...Reorganized The Fridge. See, Bottom Shelf: Meats And Dairy. And Top Shelf expired products.
No, not since I lost her at the airport.
Not that it's any of your business, but we did go out.
Nobody likes change.
We'll see how dinner goes.
Bye! Hey, I hope Emma isn't making it too hard on you.
The word you're looking for is 'Anyway'...
Oh my God!
A date.
Give daddy the Barbi! Ben, give, give me the Barbi. Okay, how 'bout, don't you want to play with the monster truck? No. Okay, oh, oh, how about a Dino-soilder?
. Good choice Ross.
What, that wasn't the great news?
Hey!
I-I, did that for you.
That bad?
Not nice enough.
Unagi. I'm always aware.
Dude, we are sooo gonna party!
Oh, fire! There, there's a fire! Fire!!
Yeah!!
Well, can't you at least stall her a little? I'll-I'll go back to some of the places I went last night.
Look, I took it too far!
Phoebe, there is no secret. Okay? I didn't propose.
Actually, nectarines, but basically...
Hmph.
A thumb?!
Hey, how are you holding up?
But you didn't! I'm still alive!! Kori, I know this is a big surprise for you. It's a long story but the things you just said really made my day! I mean, the fact that you are here means more to me than if this room were filled with people!
Hey Rach!
Oh, hey, hey Rach, do you notice anything..ahh...
You sprayed my front twice!
We were on a break!
I fell asleep!
73! 72! 71!
Please, you're going down!
I didn't order lemonade.
I was working late in the library one afternoon. It was just the two of us. She needed some help with her word jumble. And one thing led to another. If you must know, Anita was very gentle and tender. May she rest in peace...
Oh, just hold on a second. I'm watching this rugby thing on ESPN. I don't know what the big deal is. I'm man enough to play this sport.
Joey, get out of the fridge.
Oh-oh, Rach! I was just messin' around! Like you did last night when I had to pee?
Just admit it Chandler, you have no backhand.
I was barefoot. Now tell me, the toilet thing is the only thing you taught him right?
Y'know actually it does have a very interesting history. Uh, this street is the first street in the city to have an underground sewer system. Before that sewage and waste would just flow right down the street. Yeah, sometimes ankle deep!
Who am I?
It's from France...In Europe...Western Europe. Y'know umm, a few years ago I actually was backpacking across Western Europe.
Oh, wait! Wait! Don't you have an audition today? Yeah! Maybe you'll get that job!
Yeah-yeah I uh, I have a uh, a guy problem.
That ring? When my grandmother first came to this country, that ring and the clothes on her back were all she had with her.
Okay!
Yes, you can, very much.
What is it?
It was ok...
Well I checked in the uh, lost and found, I talked to the manager, no-one's turned them.
Listen, I know you wanted to talk to me, but I have an idea that may make you want to stay married. We register, and you get to keep all the presents!
Well, it was loong. I didn't even realise how late it was, until I noticed the 5 o'clock shadow on her head. Anyway, she didn't want to stay. I called a cab; she just left.
Found it.
Oh, that's not what you want...
I'm telling you, she said she's looking for a relationship with someone exactly like me.
Uh, yeah! I still can't believe she hates Pottery Barn!
Hey! She didn't look 50!
Yeah, what're you guys doin' here, aren't you supposed to be Christmas shopping?
Great! Great. Then I must've left it at Mona's. I knew it!
No, I can't. I have back-to-back classes. Did Molly say what she had? Because my throat's been hurting?
She said, "Thank you." I said, "I love you." And she said, "Thank you."
Oh oh oh! I RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE!!
Hey, I helped you find Waldo!
Yeah?
Pheebs, what's wrong?
Look, I'm sorry.
I don't understand what just happened here.
Rach, I got a message from you.
Not on the ones we sent out.
No! No I can't. I mean Rachel's out with some guy. My baby went with her. If anything that picture keeps moving further away.
I know. Hey remember...remember the night they got engaged? How uh, you and I almost...
Hey, what do you think they're doing in there?
I'm reading your ad.
Yes!
Look, I'm sorry but you-you-you better go Pheebs.
I actually had a topic in mind! I'm, I'm kinda going through a dry spell, sex wise.
Look, honey, I have tried to make nice, it doesn't work.
Ready to go?
Oh, I can't. I've got a date with that waitress, Katy, yeah, I know we've been only going out like twice, but I have a really good feeling about her.
Oh, I see, so everybody wins.
Hey Rach, can you grab me a cup of coffee?
Marcel! Where are you going with that disc?
Nothing. Oh, actually, great news! I just got off the phone with Emily and it looks like I'm moving to a new apartment. Woo-hoo!
Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, that glacier's getting kinda close.' See?
Ohh, God, nobody likes him, and he's so cheap, he'd never fly to London in a million years. Yeah, invite him? Hey, did I do these neat enough?
So you took off my pants and shoes?
Got it!
I am speachless... I mean the fact that you would put my happiness first like that. I mean, you're an incredible friend, you know that?
And it can't be Joey.
A '95 LeSabre?!
Actually, do you guys mind staying here for a while?
No-no, I-I have to see if this apartment became available.
Again, very sorry.
Please, help me! I have a date tonight. It has to go well okay-I'm scared for my health!
AND ON MY TURF?
I get it! Well, that's that.
But I'm not! . You know what if you're in the mood for Thai food...
No I don't want to play video games, Joey!
My first time with Carol was...
Oh.
Well w-w-w-w-wait, w-wait, wait, wait a minute! I mean a couple of stupid boxes get wet and she gets a Porsche?!
I see... Thanks very much. Is this your son?
I'm sorry, I don't believe contestants are allowed to talk to each other.
All right, the score is nine to eight in favor of the guys. Ladies if you miss this the game is theirs, pick your category.
The way he makes me feel about myself.
It's just, my part seemed to be over pretty quickly and then, and then there was a lot of waiting around.
Hey!
Totally.
You are totally jealous.
Hey.
No, wait! Emily! No, wait, stop! Emily, please-
You're crazy.
Yeah, yeah, everybody's here. Hey, everybody, say hi to Julie in New Mexico.
Maybe it was both of us, but we had our best friend's interest... But we had our best friend's interest at heart.
Oh, see from where I was sitting I uh. . .
But-but Cailin, he definitely will scream.
Uh... Oh hey, do you, uh ...do you have any, um, Cinnamon Fruit Toasties?
It makes him miss the bowl, but whatever.
Then tell him quickly.
Happy to.
No-no, I got the edge. I know it's not exactly ethical but I sent him a little bribe to
I am so over Janine. I mean, yeah, at first I thought she was hot, but now she's like OLD NEWS!
Hey, honey.
Nooo, I had to return it to the costume place.
You're alone.
Uh actually Joey, it's the Cretasous period.
Really?!
Well, if I'm still here in an hour, buy him a drink on me.
OK.... um, a weird thing happened to me on the train this morning...
Not since my cop-show got cancelled.
Is that what they say on the Figure Skating Team?
Yes?
That sounds fair.
I am good. Okay! Okay! Uh, I got the pillow! I got the bag! You got the keys?
Rach you did not leave the water running. Please, just pull yourself together, okay?
Hey!
Look I-I realize if anything were to happen with me and Jill then nothing could ever happen with us!
Hello? Hey Mon, how's the packing going? Ben? He's fine. Yeah, he's right-Oh my God! Get your head of your shirt there son! What? Yeah, it's a pumpkin. I'll come pack.
Ok, ok look, see, the thing is we're, we're not gonna fight you guys.
This is perfect! She'll have to come back here with your pizza, and when she does, I'll turn on the Charm-O-Ross. Oh I'm so glad you don't eat meat.
Someone at work ate my sandwich!
Oh! Listen umm, I, I just stopped by to see if you wanted to see this play tonight. Umm, it's supposed to be excellent. The director is the same...
Yeah, listen...
Hi.
Oh. Listen, do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerability become any kind of a factor here-but do you think it would be okay if I asked you out? Sometime? Maybe?
Phoebe, you can't massage people in my apartment!
200 at least.
I told Emily to come. And I just need to y'know, talk to Rachel about it.
Oh, come on you guys; that's funny! Y'know? Because he's need-he's got like a hearing aide y'know, 'cause-'cause y'know, 'cause he's all old, and...
Aw, we-we are so... So umm, well I-I-I like you and I-I love umm, y'know hanging out with you. And I mean-I'm having a lot of fun.
No, it's not just that. It's justI want someone who... who does something for me, y'know? Who gets my heart pounding, who... who makes me, uh...
And have you .. ed?
No but, no but.
What's going on, is... uh, Bobby drinking again?
Hi.
Maybe he's just jumping on a pogo-stick and really likes it?
Um, you...you like Rachel?
Ooh, I, I'm so sick of missing stuff. Ya know, I want him for more than, than a day, I want him for a whole weekend. No listen , I mean, I feel like-
What's a koondis?
So uh, Rach? Does it, does it feel weird around here now? Y'know since I've been away at college.
Oh, do you, do you really?
Joey, you owe $1100 at I Love Lucite.
All right, maybe it means that too...
Yeah.
Althea is correct.
Yeah well, he's not gonna get this one. Ben is way cuter than that kid. I mean look at him, look at you,
The first batch of margaritas was not so great, but the second batch is gooooood.
That's great! So you're staying in New York!
No.
Yeah, you're right, thanks Pheebs, I'm gonna go find her.
No, we're not!!
No.
Hey!
Really? Sounded like Three Blind Mice.
Okay! Hey!
Man! Did you see the kid on that nose?
Uh-hmm-Wait! It gets better. Um, yeah I was in Barcelona.
Rach we have a code brown situation.
No.
Yes, and the dimmer switch.
Uh Mr. Morse, can I speak to you for a moment?
Oh, yeah, why not?
I know. Can you believe that?
Eh?
Her date tipped me ten dollars.
Uh, unless! Unless, uh this lady wouldn't mind letting you go first.
He finally asked you out?
Rach!
What's up?
Oh yeah, yeah? Well uh, when we were going out, I read tons of porno magazines! 'Sup?
None.
You? You! Want to watch Ben? Yes! That'd be great, no, I just wanted to ask Monica, because I know how empty her life is.
Really?! Hey, y'know what? Since you have such a great sense of what I need, uh ooh, here's-here's 60 bucks, why don't you take Phoebe down to that Colonial flea market of yours and get me some stuff.
'S'funny, um, uh, we agreed we'd spend the rest of our lives together. Things change, roll with the punches. I believe Julia's on the table..?
Yeah, I'll take some.
I'm agreeing with you. Did you, listen, did you happen to tell Phoebe yet?
Y'know what, I don't know how comfortable I am going to see how hot the sex is between some guy and your girlfriend.
No!
No-no-no, I-I wanna play.
Yes. Yes. Don't worry. Everything's fine. We'll uh, we'll see you tomorrow at the wedding.
What? What's on your shoulder?
Ohh, I just like the smell. Mmmm.
No, no, that's funny. But maybe it's time to move on, let it go, y'know? Stop it! Besides, Rachel is going out with Elizabeth's father, so ah, he's much older than she is. Looks like I'm not the only one interested in fossils, huh?
You did so. I swear, I swear How long has she been in the bathroom?
That's worse than no food.
Look, look I'm sorry. It's just that....
And why exactly would I do that?
You know that girl I told you about who lives up in Poughkeepsie?
Spring vacation.
But...
Hey-hey-hey, when uh, when were we on a boat?
That's right. The student has become the master.
Oh, mine! Mine! Mine! Okay, here goes. Prepare yourselves for some Class A flirting.
There's no 'or' in mind. What is wrong with these pants?!!
A date?
You were saying you didn't want to seem stupid.
Can't hold her own head up, but yeah jumped.
Oh, we were helping Chandler write his vows, but he kicked us out because Joey kept making inappropriate suggestions.
I like it, and Emily likes it, and that's what counts. So uh, how are you guys doing?
No! Hey! Hey! We can't!
Ohh, you can see them, huh?
The volcano?
RACHEL!
Yeah.
...Yeah?
No! That's-that's my arm!
Y'know what? He didn't want to talk to us about being angry, well maybe we don't talk to him at all!
Mm-hmm. She's-she's emotional, but, but ballsy.
I find Marion's views far to progressionist.
Slides are almost ready.
Oh, mom. Mom. Chandler hates Thanksgiving and doesn't eat any Thanksgiving food.
Hey! Well...?
Hey, I have a question. Well, actually, it's not so much a question as.. more of a general wondering... ment.
What are you guys doing later?
Yowzah!!!
I'll get it.
But it absolutely didn't. It didn't!! It didn't!!
Yeah I know; he's in Ben's class.
Hey, Missy...
So Joey umm, you look familiar. Are uh, are you on TV or something?
Hey Chandler! Saw the new furniture. Very nice.
Eh, either way I'll pass. I still can't eat those. What's so funny?!
So listen ah, I picked Monica for secret Santa, but I'm already getting her something for Chanukah, I was wondering if you wanna switch.
Ok!... All right, thanks! Thank you so much, you guys! Oh, I can't tell you how much it means to me that you were here!
Yeah, laugh all you want but in ten minutes we're gonna have younger looking skin!
Well just hold him like you'd hold a football.
Ok, use it in a sentence.
Whoa, whoa, but then the back of the couch won't line up with he back of the carpet.
Here she is!
Ooh. What is the name of Chandler's father's Las Vegas all-male burlesque?
Alright, but you have to do one sometime.
Oh.
I know! I'm saying you have to watch them all the time.
Oh God, this is so nerve wracking! How-how do you do this?
It's ok. I'm sorry.
I know I am! ...And when it's summer, and it's hot, why can't you wear a tank top?
Mmm.
So, this must be kinda neat for ya, huh? I mean, your Dad tells me that you get a couple of days off school, and you, you ah, don't have to sell those cookies anymore.
Yeah?
Yeah that! You know I hate practical jokes! They're mean and they're stupid and-and I don't want my son learning them!
Hey you leave Marcel out of this!
So, I just picked up a message from Emily, she and Susan are going to a poetry reading together!
I'm sorry, but we have to have some boundaries! My God, I'm dying.
Uh, y'know what? I'll tell you who it hurts! It hurts the kid who has all his clothes stolen in gym class so he has to go to the principal's office wearing nothing but a catcher's mitt!
No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem a little angry?
Okay, come on! Daddy needs a new pair of electromagnetic microscopes for the Prehistoric Forensics Department! Okay. Take Pinky Tuscadero up to Inspiration Point, collect three cool points!! Yeah! Which gives me five, and let's see who is gonna lose their clothes. Ummmm, I think I pick our strip poker sponsor Mr. Joey Tribianni.
And what is second prize?
Ah....
It's not the best!
That's not really porn.
Well that depends ... have you been a baaad gi .. no I can't.
Or! Or, we could go to the bank, close our accounts and cut them off at the source.
Anyway, umm so I was um, I was hiking...
Look, I'm sorry to hear about your tragedy, ok? But the swings are perfectly safe, and besides Emma loves them. You know what, you should come with us and you'll see!
Yeah, well...nah.
Anyway, so, uh, so what is it?
150 dollars.
If like the four of us could all y'know, hang out together. Uh, in fact Emily's coming into town this weekend, why don't you say we all have dinner? Say, Sunday night?
No-no, thank you Miranda.
Kinda... spooky without any lights.
Okay, I'll see you soon buddy. Be back in an hour.
Okay, I got us a court date for tomorrow at 2:00 and I picked up all the forms. I'll take care of everything.
With mealworms.
Uh, hold, let me see, I don't know. So what're you gonna do. . .
Where there is no fear of commitment.
Alright. : Your money's mine, Green.
What happened?
Yeah, uh, except for the red sock, which is still red. I'm sorry, please don't be upset, it could happen to anyone.
Still sharp as a tack!
Ah no. I don't, but it could not have been more than sixty.
Hey!
Okay.
...that center around work.
Ok, we were sitting over there playing on the floor and he grabs the table and he pulls himself up. He pulled himself up. Standing man. I'm sorry you guys missed it but I did tape it so it you guys want to see it.
You're gonna love me so much. I got Sting tickets!!
You know, that Steffi Graf has quite a tush. I'm just saying, it's right there.
You're sure? Nobody uh, handed out uh, mints or anything?
Okay, that's it. I cannot make this decision! It is too difficult, so I'm just gonna leave it entirely to the gods of fate.
Okay, maybe this is so hard, because there aren't 50 states. Let me tell you something, I have 49 states, and there are no more! I-I think, I should be able to eat something.
The eyes...did still sparkle.
Yeah.
Hi.
Uhh, not much. You guys want to see a movie tonight?
Mom, there are so many people in my life. Some of them are seeing people and some of them aren't. Is that crystal?
Ok, here, here. There we go.
Well umm...
Actually, it looks really good.
Listen, I got to tell you I've-I've never been to a guru before, so...
Oh I'm, I'm making this too hard. Okay, what do you want me to do.
Hey, thanks Rach.
Wow.
That was going to be my next argument.
Die Hard!!!!!!
Okay, after you told me she was passed out in our room, I went in there to make sure she was all right. She was lying on my bed, all buried in peoples coats. Well, I went to kiss her on the forehead, you know. But it was so dark, I accidentally got her lips. I started to pull away, but then I felt her start to kiss me back. It was only for a second, but... it was amazing. And now, now I find out that you kissed her first.
What?
No.
What?
You did! Oh.... I always figured you just thought I was Monica's geeky older brother.
Uh-uh. See, I see.... big passion in your future.
No no no, believe me. No one has been waiting for this as much as I have, ok? And you know what the funny thing is? When this day is over, you get to go home with the baby, ok? Where does that leave me?
Y'know what? Just-just follow my lead.
I... I don't know what you are talking about.
Everyone, this is Julie.
Okay. Wow, it's-it's 5:30 in the morning. So, I'd better get cracking on this baby.
I'm telling you. I'm telling you. That's what it is. No wonder she was looking at me all funny during the wedding. She didn't say anything to you?
Meth-methane smells...
Actually, it looks really good.
She wants me to move to London.
I don't think you had an open mind about the name Ruth. I mean, come on, little Ruthie Geller, how-how cute is that?
I'm going to the bathroom.
Aw, y'know...Y'know, maybe we're-we're just approaching this all wrong. If you're Chandler and-and you wanna hide, where is the last place on Earth people would think you'd go?
Correct. Her actual favorite movie is...
No, why?
I don't know, but-but look how shiny!
That was you?
Well we gotta do something, ok? Nannies like her don't grow on trees.
There might be, a teeny, tiny, possibility.
Oh see, before you uh, when you showed it to me you-you held it that way which uh, which was misleading. Well I'm... Hello.
That, that's the only thing the zoo's ever told me.
Joey!
Hey, do uh, do you have a minute?
Shielding your face and shrieking like a girl... is not a backhand.
Hey, you're right.
Yeah, after you punched that one guy who got it wrong, word spread.
Oh no, yeah no, that part's great!
Sure, okay.
Thank you so much for that gift!
Ok.
Yeah, and I'm responsible for just like half of that.
Okay, look, how is this gonna affect you? Really? I mean you fill some form out once and a while and instead of checking the box that says Ms you check the box that says Mrs.! It's right next to it!
Ross.
Who the hell is Jordie?
Rach!
Shh! Of course, why don't we go inside?
I'm sorry, man. Hey, y'know what you should do? You should make something happen for yourself. Y'know, like-like write a play. Write a movie! Huh? I mean, what about those Good Will Hunting guys?
Hey! What's up?
Did you um-I'm sorry, did you just say it's Rachel?
What the hell are you doing? You scared the crap outta me.
You don't have to do anything. It will just be easier if it is the two of us, like college, remember? You...you break theice with some kind of jokes so that they know you're the funny one and I swoop in with some interesting conversation, sothey'll see that I'm the brilliant, brooding, sexy one...
Rach! Whoops! Rach, hey, open up, please!
Rachel?!
200 dollars.
Give me the bag.
Hey...! Rachel and I hired a male nanny.
Ok, what the hell happened back there?
Well I...I told him that if he ever hurt you I would hunt him down and kick his ass! What?! What?! What is the matter with everybody?! I am serious! I would kick his ass!
No, it's not just 'cause I'm jealous. I mean I'm not, I'm not, I'm not jealous, okay? It's... Look, the guy, he screamed, he actually screamed at this couple sitting in our seats.
Well, they're not mine!
No! No! Of course it didn't mean anything! I mean, uh well, I can understand why Emily would think it meant something, y'know, because-because it was you...
You gotta be at least bi...
FINE BY ME!!
You're over me?
No.
No! I made it seem like I was just calling to chat. Pretty sure, they both think I'm interested in them.
We'll see.
Oh it's okay. They're just-they're just wrapping her up.
My foot is stuck in the pocket.
Thanks for letting me tag along tonight you guys.
Oh.
Dad seriously! Y'know you really should see someone about that!
Well I-I-I don't care how hot it is it's-it's uh, it's wrong.
I'm so sorry ...
I don't know, but I ah, I have the feeling that my being there will do it. I'll go over and I will borrow something. Juice!! I need juice!!
Mmm-Hmm.
What? Ow!
I just found out that Elizabeth's dad wants to meet me.
Hi!
Ahh.
Oh. And what do you call that?
Phoebe, you can't get out of this! Okay? You have to learn how to ride a bike!
Of course I am! Okay, let's go godfather.
Kiwi? Kiwi? I thought it was a key lime pie.
No, we can go to Williamsburg.
What about the guy from the bar?
Wait a minute, is it because Joey and I didn't invite him to that Knicks game a couple of weeks ago?
Cousin Frannie's wedding, its tomorrow night.
Um-hmm. I have a condition, apparently, that I require two different sets of focals.
Ross? I... I grew up on your block! We had Thanksgiving together last year... I had a baby with your sister!
Hi. Uh, I have been in the bathroom. Stay clear of the salmon mousse.
Ahh.
I know.
You come out there, you're a dead man.
You don't have to do that, I'll pay for myself. But just the fact that you want me to have fun with you guys - that's so sweet! Come here.
No.
Okay, I've got to go pick up Ben but I-I will figure something out. Hey, didn't he used to have a cat?
Well, I have a PhD, so...
Yeah?
Phoebe!
Hello?
Rach, y'know I can see you naked any time I want.
Oh good, you haven't left yet.
Nope, just the one. RACH!
You were backpacking across Western Europe?
Well, well, they're good. It's been a while since I've seen you like this. You, you clean up good.
Okay, that's it, I can't take it anymore.
Now I'm depressed! ... Even more than I was.
Really?
Oh, see I-I don't know if we're gonna be hungry at three.
Doctor Burke is sexy?
Because she's just going to shoot me down. You guys saw what happened with Gunther. That did not look like fun.
I'm calling Mom.
What?
Just, just say what you feel.
Wow!
Ohhhh
Yeah, well, does he look upset? Does he look like he was just told to shove anything?
Oh, ha, I wrote that in one minute.
...But a man can change.
You can see where he'd have trouble.
And, I love you!!
Look, I don't have to answer your questions! Okay? I'm a big boy, I can do whatever I want!
Hey, when the music starts up again, I was thinking of maybe goind into the robot, y'know?
Yeah, I guess we don't have a choice. Help us! Please help us! We're stuck up on the roof and we can't get down!!!
Gunther! Gunther. Gunther, please tell me you didn't say anything to Rachel about me and the girl from the Xerox place.
Y-ello. No, Rachel's not here right now, can I take a message? Alright, and how do we spell Casey, is it like at the bat or and the Sunshine Band? OK, bye-bye. Hey, who's this uh, this Casey?
Yeah, maybe not. So what you wanna do?
What happened to the Disgustingtons?
That's 'cause-'cause you're mom's dog kept-kept looking at me.
Hello? Hi.
Yeah but, on the bright side, we get to be roommates again.
It's my new apothecary table!
We already knew that!
I can't catch a break!
Hey!
Yay!!
Good for you.
Two, I think a two.
Thank you.
No.
Hey, divorced men are not bad men!
It's what you want. You should go.
No-no.
There's something you didn't know about your dad!
...What shoe?
Okay, well, that... Wow, okay, well, umm...then maybe, at least we can, we can talk about us again.
Oh you know, pretty much the usual, uh, sun shining, birds chirping.
Hey.
Wha-, you have a phone in here?
'Pwease, Aunt Monica, pwease?' Oh, unclench. You're not even gonna be there.
Well, I guess I'm in the wedding then. Ha haaa... He stinks!
One-Mississippi, two-Mississippi, switch! Switch! Switch!!
Mmm-Hmm.
That's impossible, he's got a twinkie in the city.
Awwww!!!
So umm, where are the other guys?
And why wouldn't he get it?
A psychic AND a wishbone? Guys! Give someone else a chance!
You didn't do it?
Well, we believe it originated here. In the Aroma Room.
Woah.
Wow! I have never had such a healthy break-up! She was such a grown-up about it! She didn't seem too immature for me! Did I just make a huge mistake?
OK, my hands were no where near your butt.
She seems really, really fun!
And somebody took a shot at me!
Well, I'm gonna lie to you Joey, it's a possibility.
Okay, I have nothing in an evening shoe in the burgundy. I can show you something in a silver that may work.
Nuh-uh.
No Joey! Look why don't, why don't we just let her decide? Okay? Hey-hey, we'll each go out with her one more time. And-and we'll see who she likes best.
What?! How's that?
Well, yeah, kinda. Um, but that's okay, see we have an understanding, um, see we each have this list of five famous people, so I'm allowed to sleep with you. No, no, no, it's flattery.
This is unbelievable.
You mean, we-you and me?
Hey.
Right! So when Rigby got his samples back from the laboratory he made a startling discovery! What he believed to be igneous, was in fact sedimentary. Imagine his consternation when- Oh bloody hell.
All right. I'll uh, I'll see you later, okay?
Rach?
Bunny!
Well we-we don't know for sure. But in my head it-it sounded something like this. Of course, this is just conjecture. Okay, that's uh, that's all for today. Uh Mr. Morse, can I see you for a moment?
Absolutely. I'm fine! Totally fine. I don't know why it's coming out all loud and squeaky, 'cause really, I'm fine. I'm not saying I wasn't a little surprised to see you guys kissing. I mean, at first I was like.. But now that I've had time to absorb it; Lovin' this.
Yes, it was horrible. She cried. I cried. She threw things, they hit me. Anyway, I did the right thing.
Yeah I-I don't-I don't think I'm quite there yet, but I could say I looove spending time with you.
Oh, actually I haven't even been home yet. Do you mind if I check my messages?
A date?! She's-she's got a date?! With who?
Hi!
A bit of a daredevil are we?
What, do you, well umm, oh how about I come up there?
What'd you do, take him whaling?
