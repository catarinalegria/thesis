All right, well, I just can't think about that right now. I just wanna say good-bye to my Grandma.
Oh good! Okay. 'Cause you were acting like you didn't.
Ah-ha! A classic sign of love, the hug!
They were threefold.
Okay, I will find someplace else to do the rest of my appointments. I just don't know what the big deal is!
What about my children Drake?! Huh!? No!! No!! No! God!
Hey!
Yay!
Ursula! Wait! Err-err, it's me! Phoebe!
Hi.
What?
Your middle name is Pamela?
Let's see. Oh my God! Oh... But no! No! You can't-you can't hire him, because that-it's not professional. Umm, this is for me yes? Thanks.
And! Whoever finds it wins the prize!
All right, you know Paolo?
So Chandler, I-I'd love to come by tonight.
Oh no! No God, definitely not jealous!
London is stupid! Stupid!
Thank you. Okay, go! Go! Go! Now, if after dinner you still really need to bust someone, I know a hot dog vendor who picks his nose.
No, answer his.
Nobody! Nobody respects the bucket! You wouldn't believe what people put in here! Look! Okay, does this look like a garbage can to you?
Uh-hmm. Okay. Well then, could we reschedule? For say, Friday night perhaps at 8 o'clock?
I know that, but look, we've got the Powerball number, we've won 3 dollars!
Okay, well y'know what, don't worry you guys, 'cause I'm-I'm gonna do this as many times as it takes to get it right.
Don't you just love the way they talk?!
CHANDLER AND MONICA!!!!
Oh! I sous stand.
All right, I'd better go too. I have to go talk to my dad.
So how did you know Francis?
You know, if you want, I'll do it with you.
I'm so jealous you're all going! I can't believe I never knew that you can't fly in your third trimester!
Thanks.
Uh, hello, this is Ross Geller's personal physician, Dr. Philange.
This stuff is great!
Oh no. No-no-no, don't do that! How could I live with myself if I knew I was depriving the world of your music.
Ah-hah! At least we know it's a him.
Oh my God, I didn't...
It will be...in a minute. Listen, Tim you're a really great guy.
Thank you, very much! Oh! Thank you!
You don't know him. It's not important. He wants nothing to do with me or the baby.
Hey!
Tell me about it.
...teen!
Yeah, yeah, no, I don't, I don't know. But, y'know what, maybe it's just all for the best?
Your secret bachelorette party...
Guess what? You're almost an uncle!
Oh my God Monica!
Because I'm going to kill him
Nothing, you just have to be cool with it.
Undo it. Undo it. Undo it.
Did he mention us?
Ohh, okay, they gave you the old time pricing.
Because you would rather live here with Joey.
Yeah, I really liked that fighter pilot one.
You're right. You're right, he's just embracing life. We could all stand to be a little more like Parker. You know what? I am like him! I'm a sunny, positive person.
But at least the apothecary table is real.
Cut her out of our lives! Just ignore her calls and dodge her 'till she gets the point!
Oh sure! Noo!
Okay. Come on! That's not running! Let's go!
No. No, I won't. But I should tell you this, this exact same thing happened to my roommate Denise. She moved in with a guy who was secretly married to her and he said he didn't love her, but he really did, and it just blew up! And that's how she ended up living with me! Okay, that's a lie.
Stop it! Stop it! She keeps squirming, trying to get away! Just like when she was alive.
Okay. It's exactly how I'd imagined it would be.
No! Why?
No they ran out of "It's a girl" but I can fix this one, See?
I-I-I-I-I don't know, I don't know what to say.
I can't believe he taped the two of them having sex!
Oh my God. What happened?
It's ok. I thought of the perfect lie for you. It's easy to remember and doesn't invite a lot of questions. You weren't at the parade because you had a family emergency.
Oh no, I know! I know! It's the one where Joey got Monica's turkey stuck on his head!
Ok, have a good break-up.
I love the license plate game!
Ok.
We've got shoes being kicked off over here.
Well, I can't give you a massage, because my licence has been revoked again!
Ok so will he be back soon?
What-what's up?
Hi!
These old things.
Oh. Oh!
I really, really enjoyed it. Very exotic.
Hey, how was class?
Yeah, I thought I had one a couple of minutes ago, and now I know that was definitely one.
On your dresser.
I don't know, it's just, you know...monkeys, Darwin, you know, it's a, it's a nice story, I just think it's a little too easy.
Hi.
I... I'm Phoebe.
Oh my God Ross!!
OK, look, see, this is him. My mother gave me this picture before she died, same guy.
Well no, it was my fault so you should get the nice room.
I know but I'm having so much fun doing good deeds.
It's not a stupid gumball machine looking ring! It's a beautiful ring!
Yeah, it's for our catering business!
If she's no fun, why do you want to date her at all?
Don't, don't do the plan-laugh.
Uhuh.
Okay, don't panic. I'm gonna go to the store, I'm gonna get you another set of nails, no one's gonna know, and you're gonna look great. Oh! Oh, it's 'cause they're gonna eat-that's the problem.
Well then, what about you?! Huh?!
Please, don't play the music. Just uh one more. LIVE FROM NEW YORK! IT'S SATURDAY NIGHT!!
Hey, were the hell have you been?!
Oh no, how?
You didn't get the money, did you?
Me too! Monica, do you think we could do it?
You're in my office! Look, I have made a lot of cash for this company! Okay? I am talking big bucks! Pesos! Yen! Rubles! You make one little mistake...
Uh-huh, I'm with Ben.
All right. All right! If he wants a date? He's gonna get a date. All right, I'm gonna go in.
That's the door. He's gone...
Um, Rachel I'm really sorry. That's okay, do you wanna get back together? Yeah, okay. Did anyone else hear that?!
All right.
Yeah.
Seriously, what-what's the part?
No, yeah, we never find them! She's always best at us that wily minx.
Yeah?
Aren't you gonna go?
Exactly! Look, no matter what I tried to do, I couldn't keep you out of my life. Of all the people I have cut out, you were the only one who ever clawed her way back in.
Yeah, and you have nothing to worry about 'cos they're all crap!
Well it's just-it's one of those situations that I just hate. Y'know? A massage client gave me three tickets to the Helmet-Pelts exhibit at the Morgan Chase museum.
Well, so, umm, anyway umm, I've been, I've been looking for my Father, and umm, have you heard from him, or seen him?
So nothing got ruined?
Honey, that's gorgeous!
All right, I'm gonna go take a pregnancy test, right now.
Huh?
Yeah, bye.
What about, what about when I said y'know about the apartment pants, how dumb was I?
More than I wanna get married.
Have you thought about what you would be giving up? You can't move out of the city, what if you want Chinese food at 5am? Or a fake Rolex that breaks as soon as it rains or an Asian hooker sent right to your door?
Ok, I'll walk you out.
Good, but wait. Okay, all right, here we go. Now I want you to relax. Take a deep breath. Clear your mind. Which do you like better peanut butter or egg whites?
I'm gonna get coffee.
Ohh, you are so lucky! Hey! So, where's Monica? Did you guys make up?
Oh, Rachel!
Yeah!
Oh God, Korea is such a beautiful country.
Yeah... Ogh... Okay, fine. You made your point. Can you please just be Mike Hannigan again?
Ugh! No! This is so hard! I went through this whole book and found nothing! I want a name that's really like, y'know strong and confident, y'know? Like-like Exxon.
Oh! Oop!
Hey!
Not yet. Umm, I heard they really hurt, do they hurt?
You guys are here! Yay!
Good.
Your hair looks too good, I think it would upset her. Ross, why don't you come on in.
Well...
Oh no, Ross doesn't know anything.
Monica, Monica, you know what gets out hummus.
Me too!
Come where?
Hey, it's me. Here's Ross.
That's all right, that's well, I figured....
Who? Who is it?
Oh, thank you.
Oh, you Americans always butcher the French language.
