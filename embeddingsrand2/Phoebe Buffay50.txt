Why, I must have been in missile training the day they taught that.
Okay.
Wait, wait, I'm getting a deja vu...no, I'm not.
One? How about a whole bunch?
I know you didn't, I was talking about Monica.
Great!
Look at you all grown up.
Bye, Gene.
Hey!
Hi.
Yeah, why don't you just find another apartment?
Oh I'm kinda part of this.
Well, I told you I had to spend all the day clearing out stuff, so Mike could move in.
No but you shouldn't! Don't ever do that again.
Rachel, didn't have anything that I liked, so, but she had this Christmas ribbon, and I thought, 'All right, fine I'll be political.'
You know?!
Ok, have a good break-up.
Yeah. I really hate to give her up. Oh, I know!! Oh, you should take her!
Of course!
Ok, I didn't see it, because I was putting on my jacket, but I uh want to believe you.
Oui, bien sur je parle Francais! Qu'est-ce que tu penses alors?
Maybe we have the flight-number wrong. God.
Okay. Wait, do you know how you're going to stall her?
Oh yeah, the doctor said that could be one of the side effects.
It's Lafite. The '74 Latour is actually drinking quite nicely.
You gotta go!
I thought you were excellent! In fact for a minute there I was like, "Ooh, where'd Ross go?"
I love you too. Please don't... Don't turn into... you know... French bitch!
I think so too. And that little flap? Great for holding my lipstick.
Wrong? Really? You know the word wrong. Everything isn't perfect? Everything isn't magical? Everything isn't a glow with the light of a million fairies? They were just brake lights, Parker!
Ooh! Hi!
Y'know, you are 12 years older than her.
Ross, thank God.
Oh my God! You got off easy! When my friend Silvie's husband said someone else's name in bed, she cursed him and turned his thingy green.
Okay, you said I could sing at your wedding so, I'm just gonna need a small deposit.
Uh-huh.
Yes! Your honor?
Yeah!
Ooh, wait.. wait, I see a woman.
Oh, all right. Oh! Look what we almost took!
What are you doing?
Yeah, well, I'm very angry at him, because he slept with me and never called me back.
Is that Ross?
Hey, do you realise that at one time or another we all lived in this apartment?
He's awfully short and I think he's talking to himself. And to be completely honest, he's not that good in bed.
So, do you have any other possibilities?
'Cause it's good money! But that doesn't change the fact that this is an evil blood sucking corporate machine!
Well, I didn't get embarrassed running next to Miss . But no, okay. No, no, I can see why running with me would be embarrassing to you. Yeah, okay. You're uptight.
I love this game!!
Thanks! Honey, would you want me to take your name?
