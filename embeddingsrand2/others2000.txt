What? Where did you hear that?
Do you have the, the Ralph Lauren file?
Listen Ross, you don't have to apologize. I understand why you were there.
You're married more than once?
Oh my God! I'm your groupie!
I-I'm sorry. I, I-I-I believe I ate that.
Okay, you guys free tonight?
Okay, anytime.
Back on in 30 seconds people!
Hey Joe, you ever think about joining the force? We could use a guy like you.
You know, I like the way you have efficiently folded this tab under. See in a tape emergency you could shave valuable seconds off your time.
Why not?
Hey man, check it out, I got some great stuff to dehydrate here. I got some grapes, got some apricots, I thought it would be really cool to see what happens with these water balloons.
Oh, that's so... It really is...do we know...?
Hello, I am Guru Saj--Whoa!! That's supposed to be a duck right? 'Cause otherwise, this is waaay out of my league.
I wish I could.
13.
Hey Duck, is Chick here?
Well, it's kinda dangerous.
Uhh-huh.
Certainly. Very well. And Dr. Geller, when is my birthday?
I got a little surprise, look. There's a new fishie. I named him uh, Chandler, you know, after, after you.
Ross, there is absolutely no way this is going to come off unless you start to...
Ross!
Ooh...
Folks, when we come back we'll be talking about her new book, 'Euphoria Unbound': the always interesting Nora Tyler Bing. You might wanna put the kids to bed for this one.
Yes, the Philange is fixed. As a matter of fact, we put a whole lot of extra Philanges onboard, just in case.
Are you interested in this ring?!
It's us.
Oh! Why don't you introduce me?
Ross!
Hi, darling. Where's my grandson, you didn't bring him?
We're seriously asking for our money back?
Sweetie! So this is where you work? Oh, it's wonderful! Is it a living room? Is it a restaurant? Who can tell? But I guess that's the fun.
Sorry old boy, sorry. Sorry. Sorry. I could kill you with my thumb, you know.
How-how I like to melt stuff, and how I dislike stuff that doesn't melt.
Is everything all right, dear?
It's so nice to finally meet you!
You're look for laughable...
Hey!
Are those your teeth??
This doesn't have anything to do with the fact that he is being raised by two women, does it?
I'm sorry. I just...when I look at you I see her. When I see her I get a little bit angry.
Hey hey, come on in!
Oh, I was going to offer you my apartment.
Well, they don't have to know that...
Well I'm gonna be on it this year. I'm gonna be one of the party people.
Well, we did a little more than that.
Ohh, God, guys, check it out, you can see that girl's underwear!
This one time I had my knee up on the sink and your mother, she was.
No you stop!
Oooh, I gotta tell you... you are nothing like I thought you would be.
Does he, uh, fight with other animals?
You were?
Hey!
Ooh, yeah! She said she's having sooo much fun with Emily.
Hi.
Well, Ross and I were in grad school together.
You can forget about Emily, she's not with us.
No.
So umm, you feel like taking a test? There's only one question.
Like what?
I came to give you this and this.
Yeah, y'know the license plate game?
Well, thank you for giving it back.
We're baack!
Nice to meet you Mac!
I'll go check your file. Excuse me.
What about Julie?
Well, my goodness, what was that?
Well, if you stay till 9:20, I am.
Ross? Ross! Wake up! Ross! Ross! Ross!! Ross!!! Ross!!!!
Er, yeah, it's mine.
I got to go, so ah, I'll see you guys later.
I don't know, I mean I'm not sure ...
How do you spell that? So we can get it right.
No, it's too soon for you guys.
Wow, you look unbelievable.
Giving you my baby? You think I'd give you my child after this?
No. I'm all alone.
No, we still have food in the basement! I saw potatoes and some dry pasta!
Miss, I can't let you off the plane.
That saves us a conversation.
A little better.
Yeah, come on in.
Phoebe you're so beautiful. You're so kind, you're so generous. You're so wonderfully weird. Every day with you is an adventure, and I can't believe how lucky I am, and I can't wait to share my life with you forever.
That's why I said all those things about your flirting and your drinking...
I can write an epic poem about this lip.
The Waltham Residence.
Good choice.
Okay.
Well, here it is.
I think I know who you're talking about.
James Campbell...
Listen Joey, we definitely want to see you for the callback on Saturday.
Hang on a second. I'll-I'll talk to you in the morning. I'm sorry what?
Ah, it's not so much you, you were fat, you had your own problems. But you? What a bitch!
Sir? Sir? Excuse me, sir? Uh... I have a message for you.
Why? Wh-What are you going to do about it?
Hi Rachel!
Hi Mom, it's Jill.
Hey.
Gavin, Ralph loved your ideas.
It was nice to meet you Rachel.
I'm so happy that you're here.
There's nothing to discuss. We're not paying for your wine cellar.
Who's they?
No.
Dr. Farber, we've got a bit of an emergency here...Jason Costalano is choking on his retainer.
Those earrings look really lovely on you.
Nice uh, costume.
So? Congratulations you two, I didn't even know you got married.
Jij Spreekt Nederlands? Dat Is Te Gek. Heb Je Familie Daar?
Uh, it's the college playoffs.
Why can't you get a girlfriend your own age?
Well, there'll be women in bikinis holding up the scores.
Mom, dad, this is Phoebe. Phoebe, these are my parents: Theodore and Bitsy.
Y'know, I-I-I just...I don't want to get in the middle of something so complicated.
Bye.
I'm sorry, I do that.
What?
There is no father.
That sounds great. My God this is the most comfortable couch I've ever sat on in my entire life.
Huh, I never really noticed.
Well, after eight years of research I discovered that it can't be done.
Tramp?!
No, no, no, she's nice but, y'know, it just it made me realize that I'm just not, I'm just not ready to be dating, y'know?
You can watch our tape if you want.
I don't know. Maybe church-camp?
See all of you tomorrow.
Night-night Bing-a-ling.
Jarvis Oberblau, Cornell. I mean, the ideas you put forth and, and from someone... so... young... and... .
You weren't there!
Hey! Are you ready to try nursing again?
What?!
Oh, thanks, sweetie.
Alright!
So, tell me about it.
How about I order everyone the Moroccan chicken?
You're weak!
I brought you back a present.
Ross, it's going to be okay. I'm not going down there to hook up with a bunch of guys. I really like you. I like how things are going between us.
Sure, New Year's Eve is only two weeks away. Can you wait?
Oh!
You may kiss the bride.
Umm, actually I'm just a nurse.
Look, um I really appreciate your coming down...
Yeah, I know. Well... this is probably a stupid question, seeing that you look like that, but do you have some place that you need to be right now?
Mr. Geller.
In twenty seconds it'll be midnight...
Oh, I'm sorry, is that your basket? It's really pretty. Unfortunately, I don't see suds.
I think that's fair.
You're not dying Hope, you're gonna live a long, healthy life. With me.
Kids, I spoke to a doctor and picked up this pamphlets on how to get pregnant.
I think I brought back half of the beach in my hair. It was so much easier when I used to shave my head.
Thanks for letting me stay here! I mean Monica's place was nice, but her fiancee sure stares a lot.
What?
I do like my hair.
I'm not freaking out.
Excuse me, I-I couldn't help overhearing, you're marrying Chandler Bing?
But seriously, I believe that we should all support President Clinton. And her husband Bill.
Can I help you?
Ahh, I just got out of a big relationship, I'm not looking for any thing serious.
Hey good scene man.
I didn't mean a thong... I meant thongs...
I'm sorry. I just haven't seen her for so long! All these feelings are rushing back! I'm starting to realize how much I missed her, and I'm gonna need you to break up with her.
Breathe.
Whaddyou mean?
Our last ocean view room was unacceptable to you.
Wow! It looks like you were very generous with your grades this semester!
Yeah, but I didn't get to see it.
Good luck, with your girlfriend.
Okay.
Oh wow! That was amazing, was that really just an hour?!
Anyway, I'm gonna go and get some rest. I'm really glad I picked you guys. You're gonna make great parents. Even Chandler.
Her name's Ronni. She's a pet mortician.
It's Erica.
Yeah.
So, tonight's the night of the big bachelor party?
You've seen all the movies...
Well, you know your insurance will cover that.
But...
So it was really cool seeing you lecture today.
Don't wink at me. And put on your apron.
Yeah, well..
Well, I y'know, I was just, umm, I was just thinking and hoping, that umm, maybe you'd want to get back together?
Nooo. Uh-huh, no way. What? No.
I hear you can get people out of here.
I thought it was ok when you slept with your old assistant Tag.
Are... are you kidding? You know, when you don't see someone for a long time, a-a-and you kind of build them up in your head and you start thinking about: Come on, don't be crazy. Nobody is that beautiful, but... well, you are. Well, so, uhm... are you seeing... anyone?
You did a bad thing!
Well, I need a whole new wardrobe. My wife, well my ex-wife...
Joey!
No, they're-they're all true.
Wow, you have really pretty feet.
...we talked through most of the night and we realized that the reason we were so angry at each other was because there are still feelings there. So...
What?
I dropped a cup.
Knick fan?
You put your balloons down!!
This is the last call for Flight 1066 to Athens. The last call.
No! It's my fault. I keep trying to propose in these stupid ways and all I wanna do is tell you that I love you and I want to spend the rest of my life with you.
Thanks a lot.
Hey Sal, Jerry wants to know if the monkey's ready for the subway set?
Look, I know it must be hard that your wife is a lesbian, but it's wrong. You're married.
I would love your autograph.
The doctor says it's a matter of hours.
Chandler! Come on, I'm gonna show how to roll up your underwear and stuff it in your shoes. It's a real space saver.
I bet it's fast.
I'm sorry, I can't! I'm running a discussion group all afternoon.
'Cause Rachel told me uh, you were dying to have a threesome with me and uh, Drew Barrymore. By the way, Drew has some groundrules and...
Look, I just saw my best friends brains smeared across the canvas, that's not gonna be me, not me.
Oh God... I'll be right there, Bernice. Look, please, please don't go anywhere, okay? I'll be, I'll be right back.
Ok.
So based on your petition you are seeking an annulment on the grounds that Mr. Geller is mentally unstable.
Yeah, sure yeah. Yeah.
Look I just thought that...
Oh, like you don't already have everything.
Thank you.
Hi.
I'm sure you have better things to do.
Gary.
I don't see it. You are dancing with the tall guy over there. Tall guy, raise your hand!
Oh well, um, your, your laundry just smelled so good, that I thought I'd curl up in it. Is that all right?
You want me to kick you guys out instead?
Relax. It's just Issac's D.J.-ing at the Philly. You should come.
Wh..
Oh it's nothing, it just says that you can't sue the city if you scrap your knee or y'know, get your head blown off.
Wha, you know, maybe we can do something else!
Why the Post?
What?
I-I can't believe this! You-you've slept with him?!
You are playing American football?
Which one?
Why would you say that?
I am so glad that you could come over tonight.
But you're not anymore!
Yeah.
I don't know about the hands, but the guy that was here before me just went to the bathroom.
Hey!
One second.
This room's available.
Y'know, they ruin it for everybody.
Yes?
Oh, god.
Yeah.
Well I mean, you're American to start with. You don't even have rugby here.
Thank you, listen, thanks a lot Tribbiani, . Oh my God, look at the time, I gotta catch the bus to the ball.
Is that supposed to be funny?
That's interesting! Just one thought: You didn't mention the shoes. Who's next? Chander.
We're waiting for the candy. Bring out the candy!
Yes, Waltham interiors.
You must be a little uncomfortable.
Oh! Oh!
You're right, I apologize. Scratch the last question. Spell "Boscodictiasaur".
Do you not want to be seen with me?
Is that an expensive blouse?
...emblem of the land I love. The home of....
My name is Gary, I live upstairs.
That's great! That's great! I-I'll propose to her!
Oh, you'd be getting a really good one. I mean, you know, he's really funny. Like, the other day he made up this joke.
Oh, wow! Yay! Wow! Hooray! Oh, man!
Oh I was just thinking. You know what would be incredible? If you guys died. Ross first has a look of 'huh' then changes it to sarcastic happy: Thank you Amy.
What if you put them here.

Look at that.
Um, yeah, um, twin thing.
What?
And in the meantime you better let him drive. Does he have a license?
You're kidding right?
I still love you. And I know I probably shouldn't even be here telling you this, I mean you're with Chandler a guy I really like, and if you say he's straight I'll believe you! After seeing ya the other night I knew if I didn't tell ya I'd regret it for the rest of my life. Letting you go was the stupidest thing I ever did.
You crossed the line. Joey, describe for Gene these things that have lines. Give me 20 seconds on the clock, please. Ready, go!
Really?
Wow. Y'know we're back where we were. Honey, I would love to do all that, but nothing's changed.
Lovely to meet you.
That's a good one.
Sophie, would you please climb out of my butt. Why hasn't he called, Rachel? Why?
Let's see what we got here. Ohh, y'know, Fonzie dated triplets.
I spent two years developing this machine, it's absolutely state of the art.
I-I... Oh I...I just wanna say uhm... if you do ever come to Minsk, that's my number We'll uhm... we'll party up Vladnik style.
Get out!
She's also a scientist, so she's very smart and pretty and... well, it's actually because of you, really, that we're together, I mean, I saw what you had with that Mike guy, and I just said "Boy, I want that".
I'm right here!!!!
Mrs. Altman? She also made out with Takaka Ci-Kek the night before he went back to Thailand.
Hi.
In fact when we were building houses in Uruguay, we were, we were just two towns apart and we never met.
Joe, your dad's in love big time. And the worst part of it is, it's with two different women.
You got married again.
What?
Phoebe, we have rules here, this isn't that kind of place.
You're straight. I get it.
Dr. Farber, Jason Greenstein's gagging.
We're getting married!
Scene 5, take 1.
I didn't need to know that. I guess 21 years is a lot. I mean, hell, I'm a whole person who can drink older than you.
Yeah, me too. So, I guess this is it.
No but he didn't really talk about anything.
Well, maybe after we get reacquainted uh, you can do me.
I wasn't thinking. I was too busy fallin'...
Hi.
I heard you were sick...
Congratulations on your first week at your brand new job! It won't be long before your the boss.
What can I say? She nailed it.
You are falling fast asleep. Deeper. Deeper. Deeper. You are now completely asleep. You don't need to smoke. Cigarettes don't control you. You are a strong, confident woman, who does not need to smoke. A strong, confident woman.
Not you. Relax. Ever have to fire anyone?
I love the way you look every night Chandler! That's why I made you this tape! Happy Birthday! Love Janice!
And we kinda figured about the porch swing.
Don't say that...
Hello. Hello.
Hey Joey.
Mornin'.
Bert, Bert. Bert. Hey, what happened to my friend Bert? He was here just a moment ago. Oh no, my old friend Bert is lost.
Op.
Because you don't want me to be happy. You.. you have always been jealous of me.
Yes, Papaya Extract.
Wow, this place looks great.
That's great.
You okay?
Why?!
Hey! I missed you.
Hey guys! Hey!
May I see it?
Okay!
And, of course, if you feel that neither of those is right for you, you can always adopt.
Well, we just had a terrible lunch today at Reattica. What is with all the sun-dried tomatoes at that place?
Y'know what, I should do it.
Even if he were... cornered?
No, none at all. You need to be happy with whoever is in your home... Although if you don't mind telling me, what was your problem? Maybe it's something I can work on in the future.
What?
Wow!
Ow!-Ow!-Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Y'know, ow!
Oh, sorry!
Can't complain.
I'm sorry, you cannot go any further without a boarding pass.
Dr. Richard Burke is out of town. Dr. Timothy Burke, his son, will see you now.
I'm sorry Amber. It's just like Brad to have to have the last word.
Ah! Oysters! Let me feed you one.
Oh, no thanks, I'm just waiting for, uh, Joey Tribbiani.
...the lullabye of...
Icky? You're actually gonna throw this away because it's icky?
I want you to met some friends of mine. This guy is my hero, he comes in with some stuff he wants it blown up 400%, we said we don't do that, and he says you gotta. And y'know what, we did it. And now anytime anybody wants 400, we just say 'let's Ross it!'
I thought they could...I'll try to get back as soon as I can. I'm sorry.
Any minute now.
I know a great little place.
Mommy, I can't find Waldo.
Hey you guys!
I just realized why I remember this place.
What's taking you boys so long?
Can I help you?
I'll take "You crossed the line".
Nothing. I, I just remembered I have to leave.
How come all I can think about is putting that ice in my mouth and licking you all over?
Yeah that would be great! Let me make sure I'm not doing anything Tuesday.
Hi. I'm here for Ross Geller's memorial service.
Jack used to handle the finances!
No.
I have to get off this plane, okay? Her friend has a feeling something's wrong with the left Philange.
Well, I don't know what to tell ya!
Oh okay. But y'know what? Be careful. Because a guy was helping me before had to leave because he hurt his back.
Oh Drake.
Hello darlings.
You ready to go?
You wanna see it?
Oh, hello. Hello.
Oh, wait a second! I didn't say I wasn't free!
No. well look can I think your weird and also cool for telling me the truth and also wanna kiss you.
No, let me explain! Fired!!
Okay, that's-that's not funny. Uhh.
Or I'll hear you.
I'm afraid so.
So...
Kinda.
Yes! Yeah! Joey has great hair! Umm, I'm basically done here. Just let me get this off your neck.
You don't have, anything?
I'm so excited about having Monica come on board with us. Although I do feel bad about having fired chef Emillio, it's like losing a member of the family. Of course, that literally is the case for several of you. Tony, Carlos, Marie, please, tell your father how much we're gonna miss him. Now, I know that Monica has a lot of great ideas for this place, well, you all read the review. So without much further ado, I present to you our new head chef.
Okay, now I've really have to go!
Do you think that maybe, sometime, I could...
Someone was in the lady's room, I couldn't wait. I left the lid up for ya though.
I just sold it to that gentleman.
Uh, the usher told us to come...
Well, I'm so sorry. I thought I was leaving you with the best parents in the world, I didn't even hear about your Mom and Dad til a couple of years ago, and by then you were already grown up. I don't know, you're here, and I would, I would really, I would like to get to know you.
Ok listen, you guys have shown a lot of interest in me tonight and I'm flattered and... and quite frankly a little frightened. Can we just talk about something else?
Y'know, twin stuff is always a real big seller.
I don't know. Maybe maybe low self-esteem, maybe maybe to compensate for overshadowing a sibling, maybe you...
Joey says you don't really like his hat, but I think it's kinda dashing.
I know! I almost called off my wedding. Oh, who's your band?!
Eight months.
Boy, I'm glad I wore the big belt today.
This is Joey Tribbiani. Joey, these are the producers and, as you probably already know, this is Lennart Haze.
Why would he break up with me?
It's ok. Ho-honest mistake.
Oh Hans.
See, I told you I needed someone! Oh, you know, by the way, as a "thank you", I would really love to take you out.
Red Barbra?
Yeah? Well, there's a lot of things Carol never did before I came along.
So you work at Bloomingdale's, huh? My mom calls it Bloomies.
I don't know. I think maybe one of them is dying. I kinda hope it's the girl. The guy is really cute!
Thank you!
That's it? That's the giant number you were afraid to tell me?
This is where Ross and I are meeting for our date. So, what do you think?
Yeah! I'm just going down there to relax and hang out with my friends.
Ready to go?
My God what a fantastically well lit hallway!
...on the rocks with a twist? I remember.
Why would you serve food on such a sharp stick?
Would you like some more coffee, baby-doll?
I'm Mackenzie. My stupid parents are selling this house.
One-Mississippi! Two-Mississippi! Three-Mississippi!
Wa-wa-wa-wait! Congratulations! You did it! You did it! You can relax now. Yeah.
I feel good! ...Who are you?
Okay.
I'm adopted?
Oh well, at least you were lucky to have him. Bow-wow old friend, bow-wow. So where's the party?
wow. They must put a lot of makeup on you.
Oh, thank God.
Nice to meet you Joey.
Well if you're asking me to quit, then you're asking me to be someone I'm not. I've got to do this.
Looks like it.
I'm not coming back.
Break up with Charlie!
Yeah, um, I'm, I'm leaving now.
Really?! You?
Uh... What can I do for you?
Oh hey, thanks again for showing me your semi-precious stone collection. It was amazing!
Six dollars, please.
I don't know what to say, Benji. This is all so.... romantic.
Thanks! Enjoy your funeral.
Interestingly... no.
What! When?
Oh!
Yesss?
Hey! How's Ben?
Damnit. OH! Big surprise! The hunk of beef has feelings!
Okay. Okay, here's a good one of us.
We get off around midnight, why don't we pick you up then?
I mean, we know it's a bit hasty but, uh, it just feels so right, so...
Hi Phoebe, nice to meet you. So, how ya been?
You were saying?
I bought a restaurant and I would like you to be the head chef.
What is this? Who put a twenty down here? Huh?
It is nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Franzblau. I'm your roommate's... brother's... ex-wife's obstetrician.
We can't find another place. Then we can't have the wedding! I've ordered chicken and salad and-and cake for 150. What should be the most wonderful day of my life is rapidly turning into just Sunday with a spectacular amount of food!
I thought it went very well.
Ooh, boy. You should warn people there's no elevator! I should not have had that Mexican food for lunch.
Bye.
It's heavier then milk!
Bye.
I'm also allergic to peanuts, and cashews, and almonds, and filberts...
No.
I hate my parents.
Ross, umm, you've been in there for a long time. I'm starting to get kinda freaked out.
Uh, no, Susan and me.
Well....
Happy birthday.
Ross.
No, actually, see I had to pee, 'cause I can't use public bathrooms because the doodie parasites.
I'm sorry, sorry. You're not supposed to say "long pause"
Yes sir.
Absolutely, this will just be something we do, like racquetball.
Ah, yeah, umm. Home is never far away..
Please, can't you help me out?
Hey!
Carol, not me.
Ahh that's the 2 points.
Surprise!!!
Oh, well Richard raved about the food at his party, of course you were sleeping with him. Then I heard the food at that lesbian wedding was very nice, I assume you weren't sleeping with anybody there. Though, at least that would be something.
OK.
So far, I've sold seventy-five.
Oh! ...Hello, dear.
Phoebe, will you marry me?
You should be careful when checking your overhead bins, 'cause items may shift during...
Yeah, that's my job. Alright, look up. . . look down, now open your eyes, now look down. That's right, look into the light. Now look at me. . . OK. Your eyes look good. Those are good eyes.
Yeah.
In a moment, please, I'm in the middle of a task. And you have a customer.
Hey!
Fleischman's group. Whatever you do, don't touch his sandwiches. Ha-ha-ha...
Hang on.
Absolutely! Or maybe just a little less pimp spit.
Because by the time I find it on this thing , the whole place might have exploded. If that happens at another building that I manage, people are gonna start asking questions. Come on! Hurry up.
All-right fine, but I just want to say, I'm not paying for your wine cellar. You thieving, would be speaking German if it weren't for us, cheap little man.
Um, would you like to come in?
Just be honest with her.
Joey, look at me, look at me. Do I have lipstick on my teeth?
I do. You didn't love Barry. And I've never seen you this happy. I look at you and I think, oh, this is what I want.
Yeah, it is! Naked Ross!!
Y'know, you look nothing like I would've thought. You're...you're so young.
You know, I uh, I couldn't help but overhear what you just said, and I think it's time for you to forget about Rose, move on with your life...how 'bout we go get you a drink?
Well y'know, he's blah, she's just-she's very loud for such a small person.
1...2...3!
A year. On and off. I kinda thought we'd end up together. I don't anymore.
Oh yes. Yes, yes, I am, uh-hmm.
Y'know what, I gotta go. And thank you so much for coming.
Yeah!
Phoebe, these are our friends, Tom and Sue Angle.
Oh. Well, I'll right you everyday. 15 Yemen Road, Yemen.
You're a strange kind of grown-up.
Hi.
You're right, you're right! I'm gonna do it!
Do you?
Okay you two are asking the court for an annulment?
Well I actually, I-I really, I haven't seen her for years. But umm, well I-I was pretty tight with-with her and her daughter.
I'll call you later. Bye Ross.
I can't believe you thought that you were going to video tape us having sex on the first date!
And Rog.
Life partner.
Bye! See you later!
Really Mr. Geller, you don't have to do this.
Do-do you, do you have brothers?
Comin' out. Place your bet. Dice are out. Double or nothin'! Pay the front line!
Hey guys.
Changing one hundred! Good luck sir.
Yes dear.
Oh great!
I played Smelly Cat for the people at my old ad agency, they went nuts.
That's a tomato. This one definitely goes in the display.
Sorry, there's just more room out here.
Yeah.
Actually, you know, Joey is your friend, and you don't really know me that well; it would be weird.
Come on! You're just titling! Her legs are fine!
I am Mike.
What is it sweetie?
I'm sorry, it's just this Ernie Cofax thing on in a few minutes I wanted to watch.
It's the Gellers!
Well, I mean what can I say? I, I was married to Barbara for 30 years. She was my high school sweetheart, now you, that's two.
I can tell you work out. A paleontologist who works out, you're like Indiana Jones.
What do you mean, your seat?
Joey, bravo!
Oh, yeah. Wasn't that like a year ago?
Oh, my, god.
I don't think she'd like that.
Okay, but the money's good, plus you get to stare at Rachel as much as you want.
Action!
Anyway, I was wondering if, you were the sort of person who...eats lunch.
Well, it was quite large. I-I-I-I-I had to throw most of it away.
What?!
Yeah, but it-it-it's my whole life-you come to England.
Phoebe?
Oh but then, they went and dropped you down that elevator shaft.
Great. Uhh, just tell her her husband stopped by.
Right. I'll be there.
You mean like watch?
Bye!
Welcome to the Chestnut Inn Mr. Bing, so where are you joining from?
These got left for ya.
With him? You're is favourite, you're his guy!
Okay look, Ross, just so you know that since Lizzie likes you so much, I've decided to accept the fact that you're going out with her.
Emma, Ross wants you.
So, are we gonna get together or what?
No-ho-ho! Yeah. I mean, no-no-no-no-no, don't you worry, I'm sure with your qualifications you won't need to sleep with some guy to get that job. Although, I might need some convincing.
I'm here!
I guess.
No.
I'll give you store credit in the amount of four dollars.
And anyhow, I'm sorry I was so harsh before, but you have to understand that I still look at Lizzie like she's a twelve-year-old girl.
Your mother just added him to her list.
I'm Gail.
Just call me Paul.
Oh. Well, I wish I could say no, but you can't stay my assistant forever. Neither can you Sophie, but for different reasons.
Hey by the way, I'm sure Sipowicz is gonna be all right. I heard that kid from Silver Spoons is really good. And where did you find my badge?
Okay, um, don't take this the wrong way, but your place kinda has a weird smell.
Hi David. Chandler. Monica... Oh!
Yeah, the Knicks by 10. They suck.
Huh!
Sorry, members only.
Yeah, look, and I don't want you to feel like you have to give me your key just because...
Yeah, let's go.
Would you like to go out and have a cup of coffee?
You're not going to say anything? On our 35th wedding anniversary?
I love your car.
You're table's ready sir.
In Minsk...
I didn't ask. You wanna come in?
No-no-no, we'll move you just stay right there.
So, these will match the jacket you picked out for me last week?
Yeah-yeah.
G'night.
Mommy.
So you guys want coffees?
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
And-and then I sneak out and before Monica can her parents come in.
So we can go out again?
That's fine.
Oy!
That's great. What kind of music do you play?
So what if it was? I thought there was nothing going on between you two...
Who's next?
Is it?
Uh-huh, yeah.
I guess you can.
Yeah.
Joe, I love Phoebe. She's the single most important thing in my life. I'd die before I let anything happen to her.
Well, was there anything else?!
So ah, we on for tomorrow?
Ooh, hey! Hey, there little fella. Mr. Fuzzy-Man, how are you doing? Aww. Eww! Oh! Eww! Gross! Idiot!! Stupid little, fuzzy, yellow creature!! Oh look at me, I'm so cute, I'm a little chick who's disgusting! God, you're so stupid, how are you not yet extinct!! Quack-quack, quack-quack!! What are you quacking about?! Dumb Donald Doo-Doo!!
We went through the same thing when we were adopting.
What?!
Just keep smiling.
Is there, anything in this record that is actually true?
How long is this gonna take? 'Cause I got another critic to go yell at.
Checking to see if it's even.
You would think.
Careful! They haven't quite taken yet.
Oh yeah? I work in a cubicle surrounded by people. I've been talking to you for five minutes now about killing myself and no one's even looked up from their desk. Hang-hang on. Hey everybody! Uh, I'm gonna kill myself! I'll get back to ya. I got nothing. Wait. Uh, hey Marge! Ehh, nothing. Nothing.
Oh, uh, well, you left your good hair at my apartment, I figured you'd need it tomorrow for your meeting.
Hey, what do you want to drink?
Maybe if you just played some regular kiddie songs.
Hey Joey, I got some beer for you.
Let's never speak of this.
Umm, no. Thanks, but I'll give these to Betty. So I read your evaluation of Tag, or to use his full name, Tag Sweetcheeks Jones. Is something going on with you two?
Now, nooo! I'm just excited about the restaurant, that's all.
Do you ever worry that you'll be walking and your baby will just like slip out?
Youre kidding? She seems so...
What does that mean?
I know! I-I'm a big fan of yours.
...so I've been slowly phasing out the wine importing and focusing more on the cheese side of things.
Oh, who's this little guy?!
Uh, I am, uh, to say good-bye.
There's one thing missing.
Good God Bing I...well I can't say I'm altogether surprised, I saw the way she looked at you, and there was no love there. And the way she looked at me, pure lust.
No, we went to the left.
That can be arranged.
Uh, not really. But when it comes to cheese, I'm one of the people who thinks the smellier the better.
Thanks Rachel. And-and don't forget you-you can come visit her anytime you want.
Oh, wait, I remember, she also said she wanted to sleep with me one last time.
Morning.
Congratulations. Okay, Mr. Bing you'll be in 25J and Mrs. Bing you'll be in 25K.
So, this was uh, really fun.
Uh, can we have three chocolate mousses to go please?
You're kidding! I-I spent three years in Amsterdam.
Drake, I've discovered the reason for all your headaches and memory loss.
Jarvis?
Yeah, well, it scares me! I mean I not even divorced yet, Chandler. You know, you just invited me over here for pasta, and all of the sudden you're talking about moving in together. And, and I wasn't even that hungry. You know what, it's getting a little late, and I-I should just, um...
Flowers, liquor, recarpet first floor. New guest bath, landscaping. I'm paying to remodel this guys house. I'm going to give that son on a bitch, a piece of my mind.
Calm down, we got time, we're running a little late.
Are they still looking for us?
Please, clean my beakers. I don't get out of the lab much.
Really? Well, in that case...
Uh, the dog.
Rachel?
C'mere, Patti.
Care to venture a guess?
I guess. There was hum... there was another reason that I thought it was time to end it with Joey. I started to realize that I was having feelings for someone else.
No. Because I know how to write men that women fall in love with. Believe me, I cannot sell a Paolo. People will not turn three hundred twenty-five pages for a Paolo. C'mon, the guy's a secondary character, a, y'know, complication you eventually kill off.
Hi.
Which is bad, because?
And then, and then you said that thing about, about bringing the Mesozoic era in the 21st century.
It's made from eggs!
I'm not supposed to drink coffee, it makes me gassy.
Charla, 278. Sorry, dear, but still good.
Absolutely, yeah!
We'll just get him cleaned up a bit.
So when people complement me on my cooking should I, what do I say?
Sure!
Ross!
Yeah. Yeah, excellent.
You spend half your life in the bathroom, why don't you ever go out the bloody window!
How did you know they were in my bottom drawer?
My friend Lewis told me you were giving out money.
Yeah, that's what I drive. I make four bucks an hour, I saved up for 350 years!
Me.
Oh yeah, aww!
Eric!! Let's go!!
Can anyone else name a well known seed that's been masquerading as a nut?
Wait!
Ohh, Ross, please!
Hey, Joey.
I love that idea!
Looks like that might come any minute.
Cool! I'll catch up!
I notice that you've been trusted with a lot of rather important responsibilities.
Good morning!
Yeah. Are we nuts here?
Umm uh, I'll make some coffee and we can uh, chat.
I can't believe Emma is already one!
Well, this all looks good.
"I-I-I can't tell you somethin' I don't know."
I'm not sure yet. Why didn't you just tell me about all this?
Yes...
He's just jealous. You'll fit right in; all Londoners wear them!
I don't know. Let me see the ring.
Loved your Stevie Wonder last night.
They're always going to tell you they don't need toner, but that's okay because whatever they say, you can find the answer to it here in this script.
Hey!
Oh, what about this one. Rachel: OH!
Ok Geller. Last day of the conference, you know what happens to the keynote speaker.
What?!
Hi.
Uh, would you take one of us?
Hello, welcome to Lavender Day Spa SPA. How may I help you?
But it's my car!
Hi sweetie!
Listen uh, maybe we could get together later?
Yeah he's no good. Do you ever think about me in a non-eye doctor way?
I don't know anything about music, but I think you're really, really great.
So... how many guys have your key?
Folks, has this ever happened to you. You go to the refrigerator to get a nice glass of milk, and these darn cartons are so flingin'-flangin' hard to open.
Uh, I don't have a wife or girlfriend, but I do like to ski.
Hi.
I can't do that!
So Chandler, you're parents must've been thrilled when you told them you were engaged.
Want us to go?
No-no-no, no. I'm going to talk. I believe that the sun has set on our day in the sun.
Okay. So I'll come by in a couple hours and pick you up?
So uh, you wanna go to Marquel's?
Oh damnit!
Actually I've been playing a lot of love songs lately. I've missed you.
Aah!
Hey!
What.
Hey!
Oh my God, who died on this?!
Wow. I'm sorry. Eggroll?
Phoebe, why don't you come in the living room and meet our friends?
Well, if I ever goto Minsk, you'd better watch out.
No. No, haven't seen a monkey. Do you know anything about fixing radiators?
You have three nipples?
Come on over the years none of you ever y'know, got drunk and stupid.
Wasn't Nick funny when he couldn't get his match lit?
Lights. Uh, romantic lights.
Madame, your passport please?
You're in this picture?
You can say that again Mac.
Hello?
Hey!
What?!
Hi, I'm Maria.
Hi.
Hey it's Mona! From the wedding.
That's so great for you guys!
uhm... Is everything okay?
I love Mark. Do you know Mark?
So! Me neither! God, Mary-Angela was right you do have the softest lips.
Hey!
It says to call this number if you're not completely satisfied with this candy bar. Well, I'm not completely satisfied.
Well, me and my dancer friends are thinking of doing Thanksgiving uptown. I thought you guys might like to come.
Phoebe writes lots of great songs. Wha... What was that one you sang the other night that everybody just loved?
Well, I've changed your screensaver from that picture of *Nsync.
I'll always remember that summer, because it's when I got all of these freckles.
Actually I ah, I am a poet.
No.
Sorry. You look beautiful.
Okay, listen, I really like you. Okay? I think this can go somewhere. So what if I'm close to my family, are you gonna let that stand in the way of us?
Oh my God, I completely forgot! Oh my God! I can't believe they let us back in this place! .
It's hard isn't it? There's almost no time for a social life. I mean, where are you gonna meet someone?
Three.
But, he told me over the phone.
Yeah.
What?
Look, I just wanted to have coffee with Rachel.
Monica bang!
Good-bye and God speed, Hope Brady.
Excuse me, I'm sorry, you haven't said anything for about two and a half minutes, are you at all interested?
So, are you experiencing any discomfort?
All right.
I'm next!
Well, not at all...
Maybe it's crazy in a perfect world, a world without lab coats and blazers, but you not in a perfect world, you in a museum now. See that scientist in the classes, he and I used to play together all the time in grade school, but now... Peter! Hey, Peter! It's me Rhonda! From PS-129! I shared my puddin' which you man! I gave you my Snack Pack! See, he pretend he don't even here me!
hm-mmm... Mom said she gained like fifteen pounds.
But well, now that we're together again, I don't ever want to be apart. So, to that end...
It's lame, I know. But I'm a goal-oriented person, very eager to learn...
Bye Phoebe.
I'll be back in ten minutes.
It's clean.
Oh-oh-oh-oh!
I remember your first birthday! Ross was jealous of all the attention we were giving you. He pulled on his testicles so hard! We had to take him to the emergency room!
Excuse me. Can, can I help you with something?
Taxi.
Oh, you're busy, that's ok, I'll get it. Anybody else want one?
Hey Chandler.
Ohh, it's time to go.
What?!
I had them made special.
Exactly! And you just know I'm gonna be the guy caught behind this hammerhead in traffic!
That must have been hard.
Give us a kiss. Come on! Come on!
Oh, there's our stop.
You ready to go to the batting cage?
Good deal.
I mean, I know what I'm talking about. I gave up two babies, and I only wish I had someone there that had given up babies, that could tell me how terrible it is to give up babies. I just think that, it would be something you will regret every single day for the rest of your life. So, how ever hard it is to give up this puppy, it would be like a million times harder to give up a child. I really shouldn't have given you the puppy first.
If... if you want to drink, it's OK with me, I've got to get used to it.
That won't be necessary.
I'm sorry, it's not here.
Oh my God. I think you're right.
Rachel and I had a really big fight, can I come in? I-I mean I know we're not supposed to see each other anymore and I'm okay with that, it's just that I don't know anybody in the city and I really need somebody to talk to about it.
Absolutely.
Oh, you're so funny. Listen, umm, what are you doing after rehearsals? Do you want to get a drink, or something?
I have a date.
We're back on.
So which one of you lucky boys is Chandler?
What do you need help for?
I think he's stoned again.
Jack, is it all our fault? Were we bad parents?
Three months.
I love this artichoke thing! Oh, don't tell me what's in it, the diet starts tomorrow!
Could you press up too please?
What?
Is everything all right?
Bye.
I ah, I work at Bloomingdale's and I might know of a job possibility if your, if your interested?
I moved back here a couple of months ago.
Hello.
Your no God's gift to women, that's all in your headdddd. You are just a buttmunch.
Heh... y'know?
Yeah. Monica, I want you there in the front row when I win. I want you close enough to smell the blood. What do you think?
Okay, how about this, you guys die and the crazy plate lady dies, then do I get the baby?
That's great. I worry about little Ross. He's always reading, he's collecting rocks and he's obsessed with dinosaurs.
Y'know what? It doesn't matter! Because it is not true!
OH! OWWWWW!
Yes, I am.
That's good. Very good!
Beep!
Well, if you're one of Ross's best friends, why aren't you here?
Well, ok then. I'm gonna go. Bye.
Your first marriage?
Hi!
Well, then if there's nothing else, then the two of us should talk.
So you still think you, um... might want that fifth date?
Can we do it again?
Yeah. But then I changed my mind. I'm funny like that. So I told Lizzie, now I'm telling you, I don't want you seeing my daughter anymore.
Dennis is a dear old friend and a fantastic lover.
I will if you will.
Only because my parents wanted me to be, I wanted to be a sherrif.
No! No!
Excuse me, I'm standing right here!
Well who would?
Yes I am.
Umm, do you sell these bags?
Who's party is it?
Just hear me out!
Hi, I'm Joshua, I'm here to pick up Rachel.
I thought that movie was so incredibly... boring. I mean, that thing at the end where the kid kills himself because he can't be in the play? What was that?! It's like, kid, wait a year, leave home, do some community theatre. I walked out of there and I thought, 'Now, that's two hours of my life that I'm never getting back.' And that thought scared me more than all the other crap I was afraid to do.
Oh? Why not?
What?!
C'mere, Patti.
Anyway, that's all I know. That, and this. This is the real him.
Ross, let me show you where the guest room is.
Wait. I wanna show you something.
Thanks a million.
Hey.
Ohhhh!
Good. Now imagine your vagina is opening like a flower.
That's cool. Cool.
The pizza-place across the street any good?
Hi.
No-no-no, no, it's going to be fine. Because umm, because I teach Home Ec, and uh, I can have 30 kids making baby clothes all year long. Y'know it'll-it'll be like my very own little sweatshop.
Oh, thank you.
Well, I think Brian's a little out of your league.
Right. We do have a table for two available, perhaps you would be more comfortable.
Hey. What are we drinkin' over here.
Okay.
your welcome again, I'm gonna make some coffee can I get you anything?
Hi.
Where did they go?
Okay! See you later!
Why not?
Yeah, it's not like I don't have a sense of humor, huh? Hell, I even enjoy a naughty limerick now and then. But there's a time and a place, huh?! Unless you uh, have a limerick right now? No? Okay, well uh, you've got my fax number.
I told you, we're adding new operators all the time. Could we concentrate on my training?
Knowing you're here, waiting for me I think it's kinda exciting.
Uh-huh, I don't know.
Come on!
Get a load of this... She's proposing to him. Guess we know who wears the pants in that family.
That's a good one.
I think you've got concussion.
Jack, that's what they call the subway.
What?!
Wow, you're here already.
Mississippi? I said count to five'!
Rust, is boat cancer, Ross.
No, under these circumstances it has to be an injection, and it has to be now.
That's a good one!
Yeah.
I could play the oboe!
Just a sec. Hope you find your monkey.
And your breasts! Hmm!!!
Alright, so now you're doing this whole book tour thing, how is that going?
Cool, alright. So maybe, ya know, I could give you a call sometime, we could talk or somethin'.
There you go.
No, it's about all women. Well, all American women. You feel better now?
Look, forget the check, okay. I like you. I think you're great. Come on, what do you say?
All right, first thing we gotta do, damage control.
See the thing is umm, we're not able to y'know, uh, conceive.
Remember the class play? You, you pulled up my skirt and the entire auditorium saw my underpants.
Hi.
I'm not gonna tell you! You're the bad man who broke Sarah's leg.
Phoebe! Phoebe! Hi! Hi!
If you need an easy way to remember it, just think of a bag of crap.
July. Umm,
Hello! Who's in there?
How did we do?
Yeah, I love you. Okay, bye! Hi!
Hi!
What's the matter?
No, no, they only said you.
Op, this is saved. Gift shop.
Although, I have enjoyed the fact that, uh your shirt's been stickin' outta your zipper ever since you came back from the bathroom.
You guys live around here too?
Do we have a name yet?
Oh. They don't.
Oh. Oh-oh-okay, I get it.
Plate?
You are!
Y'know why? She's got the Christmas bonus list in there. I saw her working on it this morning.
That's good, that's good. So, so, so who broke up with who?
I want you right here, right now.
So, what are you guys in the market for? We've got uh, scarves, tulip post cards...
No!
Uh, I'm a little embarrassed about calling you a hottie on my evaluation...
How are you?
Hey, she just woke up! She's hungry. Why don't we give this another try?
I can do that.
I, uh, wanted to see if your offer to spend Thanksgiving with you is still good.
Ah! Nora Bing!
Hi sweetie! Are you leaving?
...taking a long walk, and then there's the one that's proved most effective: sex.
Good night, it was very nice to meet you all.
This is the boarding call for Flight 009.
To the Bings!
Well, that' me. Here, have this. I'm only allowed one piece of carryon anyway.
Ross Geller, why do I know that name? It's uh-Wait! Did you write this?
Fire safety is not a joke, son.
As long as you don't see Rachel anymore.
I just had sex.
OK Phoebe, you ready to try one?
May I help you?
Oh, you know what? This is nothing. My father is a raging alcoholic.
Okay, everything looks good. Here it is on the screen. Here is your uterus. And right here is your baby.
So this is it? Victor?
Lovely, just lovely.
I hope you can find some way to be happy for me. And I hope you'll still be my maid of honor...?
No, she's at a faculty meeting.
Now, y'see, most people, when their pets pass on, they want 'em sorta laid out like they're sleeping. But occasionally you get your person who wants them in a pose. Like, chasing their tail, or, uh, jumping to catch a frisbee.
And there is Kevin.
Doctor Ross Geller.
Would you mind doing a picture with us?
Yeah! Right!
That you and daddy were not on a break.
Alright, I'll call you.
So what did you do today?
Hey! You can't go back there!
Phoebe, I-I-I-umm, Oops. I just, I-I-I-I don't, I don't know what to say. I just can't believe that you're my daughter, you're so pretty.
Hi. Okay, will that be all?
Hey! Hey! This is ah, my fiance, Mrs. Knight.
Ok. I heard a joke today. It's pretty funny...
Oh my God.
Smile ladies.
Bona sera.
Yes, and come see the bird show at 4. The macaws wear hats. Well it's a lot cuter if your monkey hasn't just died.
The next tour of the wine cellar will plan in two in-in minutes...
Okay, Dave in the membership office, handles quitters. Uh, excuse me, are you a member?
No! No boom-boom before big fight!
Am I interrupting?
Okay, I should, I should probably be getting back to my thing now. See ya.
Wow!
He told on us?
Hmm, come on, you just said to her that you....
Not really.
I'm talkin'!
It's a different building.
Yeah, well, uh, we're kind of a thing now.
That is great. Good work! Chandler. Thank you.
I was just, I was just gonna take out my lenses.
M-Me again?
Well, that's just probably 'cause of your Amish background.
Maybe he's intimated by really smart, strong, successful women.
Umm, no. See I already thought she was dead so I kinda made my peace with it. Plus, I'm going to a concert tomorrow. So... I'd invite you, but umm, I only have two tickets left.
It was dreadful. I felt terrible about how I acted when you said those wonderful things.
I'm surprised to, but yet here I am.
You don't mind? Well, what do you know, it fits!
Excuse me.
That you enjoyed the occasional drink...ing binge.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Y'know, it's funny, but when we were studying communicable diseases...
No, but I'm asking-
Hey, buddy.
Is that my ass?
I'm Ted, and I just moved here a month ago, and New York really scares me.
I'm looking for Phoebe Buffay!
These are my night vision goggles. This is the book I pretend to read when I'm watching her in the park. And these are Mad Lips, they're just for fun.
I don't know one actor worth his salt that didn't say at one time or another, "God, I stink!" Hell, I just did a scene out there, first take, I stunk the place up. But, the important thing you must remember, no matter how badly you think you might stink, you must never, ever bust into my dressing room and use my shower! Do you understand me?!
Why don't you try to do-
Behind you?
Hello!
Hello, Joey, our little matchmaker. I could just kiss you all over, and I'm gonna!
I'll go.
Why do all you're coffee mugs have numbers on the bottom?
Like lovers.
Yes.
Can't we just ask her to go?
I was gonna say...
So we're doing it?
Uh-oh, Bruiser has Becker on the canvas and is going for his favourite area.
Gay!
Hi.
The next tour of the wine cellar will plan in two in-in minutes...
I think it's interesting.
No he's not! He's totally yanking your chain! He's done this with three other teachers!
Well... I just talked to Sid, we are definitely putting in an offer on the house... a-a-and I'll bet we get it.
Hey.
Hey. Ursula said she left her purse.
Mom, Dad, what are you guys doing here?
Can you believe it. I've never had any professional dance training.
You sick freak, who does that? I can't believe I had a crush on you!
What?
Ohh. Like what?
I've gotta call my friend Mary and tell her how good this is, from Monica's room.
Well? Aren't you gonna do something?
Okay. I'll be right back.
Yeah, most of the damage is pretty mostly contained in the bedrooms.
Would you like to see a semi-private room?
Okay, I'll see you in an hour.
Yeah, you know, maybe I ate too much. I keep getting these stomach-aches. They come and go like every few minutes.
Hey! I got a kid starting college. I've to get surgery on my knee, you just lost me ten grand!
You are iron. You are steel! Let me ask you something, how come when I call your computer support line, I have to wait an hour and a half?
What did I tell you about talking to your friends while you're working?
Oh I think it's best that I speak first.
Stay calm?!! How do you expect me to stay calm?! This is unacceptable Rachel! And I wanna know why?!! Is it because that punk Ross won't marry you?! That's it! Is that it?!
It's gonna be ok, just remember, we're doing this for Jordie. Just keep focusing on Jordie.
Uh listen, I just-I thought you should know I broke up with Ursula.
So, what do you think of my daughter in the apron with the big job?
Was it her quarter?
Yeah, I really cherish these moments, 'cause before you know it, they're gonna be awake again.
No it's not too soon, I had lunch at a eleven.
Ross and Emily have made their declarations and it gives me great pleasure to declare them husband and wife.
Sorry, I wa- I was just saying to my friend that I thought you were the most beautiful woman that I'd ever seen in my- in my life. And then he said that- you said you thought
Yeah, we are going to share every moment of this with you. And I think we're gonna have some fun.
I don't know. Could be because I don't feel like standing around all night waiting for some guy who may or may not scream.
Oh right, uhm, Don?
I mean hey! I just met you, I don't know you from Adam. ...Only child, right? Parents divorced before you hit puberty.
Would you mind spending some time on my siadic area, it's been killing me today.
Hey, you keep pushing me on this, my foots going to meet the middle of your ass.
And first, I have to see the MET!
I don't think they did.
I don't have any great ideas. I am eight.
But, we can't go now. It looks like Rachel's gonna put on a skit.
What a nice story!
Ah, I thought I'd find you here, Nasforatool.
Thanks.
No. What ever happened to that little dude. So full of dreams...
Aaaah, what's wrong, c'mon.
Hey... Wh... What are you doing?
You expect me to believe.. Hi Ralph.
That's my monkey. That's Patti, Patti the monkey.
As in my grandmother.
So... they sss-still seem normal.
Working with blind kids.
No, pretty much just a towel.
No no no.
Whoa! Big octopus.
You don't have to go home tonight, do you?
Why aren't you at home in bed?
Okay, it'll take just a little while to prepare the embryos.
Do I know why we're rushing?
It's awfully pink.
Yeah, you're funny.
You're so sweet!
Hi! Look! I got our pictures developed from Rockefeller Center.
Here she is!
You know, whatever we pick, she would've told us it's the wrong one.
May I help you?
Hey, Rach!
Crap Bag?
No, I really did forget my purse.
What?! Why?!
Goodbody!
So, ehm... I'm proposing to Pheobe tonight.
Yeah... And I'm giving it back to you... Come on! Consider it a contribution.
No... he killed his father with a shovel. But other than that, he's a great guy.
You got Rachel pregnant?!
Alright, okay.
Hi, is Rachel here? I'm her sister.
Let's go Phoebe!
Yo, Chloe, do you have a quarter for the condom machine?
Oh my God!
Well, I've been calling you, but it turns out I had your number wrong. And when I finally got the right one from Information, there was no answer. So I thought I'd just come down here, and make sure you were okay.
Uh, sure, why not.
Did you bring the toe?
Oh, somebody's been doing his buns of steel video.
No, it isn't, because you won't let that happen. Don't you know it yet? You love me, Chandler Bing.
I don't know. They-they must be your mother's, but please, please don't ask her. I'll throw these away.
Oh, thank you Phoebs. That's very sweet.
I have a wonderful idea. You should take Rachel to the prom.
Right.
I see. I guess you never really know whats goin on inside a persons head.
Oh, I must've said that after you left.
So you like the short hair better.
Hi. I'm Monica.
Okay, that doesn't sound good.
Ok, you want the dirt? Alby was seriously insecure. I mean, he was really intimidated by the guy I dated before him.
Come on along and listen to...
Hey!
... is it weird that it's not with each other?
Yeah, that would be fantastic! My-my nephew is crazy about the Knicks! This is fantastic, thank you so much Rachel.
Okay, cool, all right, she just ah, parking the truck. I'm gonna, I'm gonna get my ah, my fiance man!
Whoops. Sorry. This just in. Oh, it's 9-1-1 from the restaurant, that means Monica needs me right away.
Y'know what?
Uhh, not that I know of.
Ehhhh... B-Buttons.
Congratulations!
Umm, look I-I-I got a confession to make...
That's great!
Twenty-four actually.
Wow, I didn't know they let you keep chickens and ducks as pets.
Ohhh.
Completely anonymous. From two kind strangers.
Morning. Good morning.
Actually, he is buying a much bigger place. It's got a great view of Central Pa.....
Really?
You don't think they'll judge and ridicule me?
Doesn't it make her nose look smaller?
Move!
Hey, you got one right!
Hey, you don't have to smile. You just have to dance.
Um, oh, I don't know. I mean, it's definitely weird not being with Ross, but I guess I'm doing OK. Actually I've got some of his stuff that he, um....
Thank you.
I don't think so.
Actually, I should get going.
Really?
Can you believe how we spent our two weeks together?
Oh, that sounds lovely. We're gonna have to set that up. Oh, I better get back. Hope the baby feels better.
I know! Why don't you get drunk! That worked for a lot of girls in my high school.
Yes?
Well we left ours in Monica's bedroom.
Oh my gosh, that was so lame. Like a pajmena could be a rug!
A joke they would appreciate?
Okay, but isn't sex better when it's with one person that you really, really care about.
Sorry, the lightning. Lightning was an unfortunate incidence. You look lovely, lovely.
I'll take a look at him.
Maybe it wasn't Bob, maybe it was a mouse.
Uh, actually, actually, I'm having a party at my place on Saturday, it's sort of a house warming kind of thing.
Hey!
There you go.
I'm Mrs. Dr. Barry Hunter hyphen Farber.
I'll let you get acquainted.
We're all beginners here. Nobody knows what they're doing.
My God! Aren't you freezing?
No, that's not exactly what I was..
No! I mean you're a really nice guy and I'm happy to be your roommate and your friend, I'm just y'know, I just don't feel that way about you.
But, we are.
Well, there's my favorite client. So tell me darling, how was the audition?
And in fifth grade I got into a fight. Well, it wasn't really a fight. Richard Darinvel bit me on the nose and, and I feel down. I still have a little scare right here you can see it.
Okay, yeah. I mean... If that's, if that's really what you want, okay.
You thought I was Rachel?
Pleased to meet you.
Eeaagh!
You have me!
I can't help you Joey.
So, you're a paleontologist, right?
No no. Henry's almost two and he's talking and everyting. Here. You know, the other day he told me he liked me better than his other grandpa. Now in all fairness his other grandpa's a drunk but still. . .
Get out of my line.
Oh Rachel, I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to overwhelm you. It's just that, when those gates open, you... Hard to close 'em. But they are closed now. Believe me.
Ooh... Is it because of what might be on the bedspread, because I saw that news report too, with the infra red and the ... I could just...
Hi, its us.
14.
Hi there.
All right, whenever you're ready.
Here are the audition scenes.
Sticky shoes, sticky shoes, always make me smile. Sticky shoes, sticky shoes, next time I'll.... avoid the..... pillleeeee.
18th and East End.
I don't know? Do I? Do I?
Hi! Rachel Green's office.
Totally! Wow! Would you excuse me for a sec?
How can I help you?
I got a little drunk...and naked.
I'll give you another minute.
What?!
What?!
Phoebe! That's a great name.
No. If I can't have your clams, you can't have my dessert. This is a two way street.
Hey, Dr. Farber.
Sure, sure. What's with the chair.
Excuse me, I'm standing right here!
Well sweetie, we have a surprise for you. We're turning your room into a gym.
Yeah well, being that he was the victim, they're usually pretty talkative.
Phoebe? The lady who sells toner?
We've only known each other for six weeks!
I thought of a thing.
No.
Would you like to call somebody?
Just aim for the bump.
I lose, now Jenga.
Why do have a picture of Paulette in your pack?!
Have a seat through the glass doors.
Oh yeah yeah, thank God you were here to oversee all the kissing!
Take it easy--if you want, there's cookies on the counter, or, or--sangria! I can make sangria!
Hey Rachel!
Ross!
Hey, dragon! Here's your tips from Monday and Tuesday.
There are a couple of forms to fill out.
It's, uh, it's Paul.
Ross, we can solve this. I just heard your speech. We can recreate it! We've got all night!
Dating profile? I-I-I'm talking about the work resume.
Wow, excuse me, sir, do you have a boarding pass?
Uh, listen Bing, I received your memo. So, we're not gonna receive the systems report until next Friday?
Hey guys!
Neither am I.
Suspect has just emerged naked from the sewer.
Well, I was just wondering about the mother-to-be, but.. thanks for sharing. Uh, lie back..
Yeah! This feels really good.
I, Emily...
Do you?
Huh. What's Tag's last name?
Ross, drugs? Divorced? Again?
How's that coffee comin,' dear?
I'll see you later.
Bye.
Hey, hey, hey, her stuff wasn't in it.
Become a drama critic!
Is something wrong?
I met Phoebe today. She was really nice to me eventhough I'm such a loser. And, then when I was walking home I thought about her a lot, it was weird, but kinda cool.
Hey Chan, is that Joey guy gonna come by and pick up his moose hat or should I just toss it out?
Well, I mean... It sounds good to me. And that way we can save up, come back in a few years and make an even bigger donation.
Take thee, Emily...
Yeah, and they-and they say that our-that our only chance to have a baby is that if they take my sperm, her egg and put it together in a dish and then put it into another girl. So we were wondering if you could be the girl that we could put it into.
Oh, like, uh, five minutes?
You know what your problem is? You're threatened by me.
Hi.
Don't worry about it.
Monica, Chandler. I'd like you to meet Erica.
Hey, my favorite part is coming up!
Miss? Please, sit down!
Who is it?
I suppose mainly sexual.
If you're planning on doing that throughout the entire flight. Please tell me now. So that I could that a sedative...or perhaps slip you one.
Listen Chandler, the way I see it is that I was lucky enough to find someone that I really love. I just-I wanna be around her as much as I can.
What?! I can't believe you're trying to stifle me! When just 14 hours ago we figured out that that is exactly what my mother was trying to do to me!
Yeah.
'Despair fills the mattress showroom. My kingdom is suddenly without a queen. I'm so depressed I'm going to slash... my prices!! Check it out! Four ninety-nine for a pillow top queen set! I'm going medieval on prices!
You know, you were right? I mean, I thought we were happy. We weren't happy. But with Mindy, now I'm happy. Spit.
So, all right.
Oh, this is such a cute picture of Emma. And is this your son... or just some kid whose picture you bring on vacation?
Good-bye.
How are you?
Are you serious?
Hey guys, how is it going?
All right, I was 15, it was my best friend, Ruth, and we got drunk on that hard cider, and then suddenly, I don't know, we were, we were making out.
Thanks!
I'll survive.
Are you wearing my glasses?
You are gonna be fine, believe me.
I want to talk to that bastard, see what his problem is.
Hey, you're gettin' better. I'm gonna keep this by the way.
Oh, I hate this but I-I-I have to go. I-I can't miss my flight.
Alrighty. From the top.
Hi, were the Rostins. Err, Im J.C., and hes Michael, and were having a boy, and a girl.
I think we have an answer.
I wasn't invited.
I'm sorry Mr. Geller. But ya know, there's an old saying, 'Sometimes monkeys die.' It's not a great saying but it certainly is fitting today.
I think my character's gonna need a little bit more of reason than that.
Yeah! Punch him!!
Who?!
She's there?!
They prefer it if I don't barter.
We had a good time. By the way, I wanted to ask you something. It would really mean a lot to me, if the baby was a boy, that you name him after my father, Jiminy Billy Bob.
Yeah, it's-it's my only weird thing, I swear. And I-I-I would've told you about it, but I didn't know they would be here.
Yeah, not really. Babies are dull.
Ah, oh, hang on a second. Come in, come in. All right, so think about it, and call me back.
You think you could make a mess and the big man in coveralls will come in here and clean it up, huh? Well, why don't think of someone else for a change?
Also Monday.
Things change, roll with em.
I love you!
Seriously, you're an intern?
Sure, I'll just get my coat. Could you get that?
I'm waiting.
All right, let's try one.
So once they caught on to the fact that we're, y'know, short and have breasts...
I could... but I won't. If I find that monkey, he's mine.
Stay.
I dunno, uh... you just have a-a...
I'm having a conversation here! You were saying?
I felt it!
I'm gonna take her back to the appartment.
Thank you! So, can I stay with you?
Hey!
Well of course not, but you were very good.
By the way, do you know who's moving back into town? Tom and Sue's daughter Jen.
Oooh, c'mon, shut up, it's fun. Gimme a hug. Well, I think we're ready for some tequila.
Congratulations.
Why?
Well, if he's up against a jungle cat or an animal with horns, you've got to give the little guy something. Otherwise it's just cruel.
What is, honey?
Hey what?
Okay, I guess you can...close the door now.
Joey? Do you want me to put it all in your room?
Aaaaah!
Yeah, okay, bye.
Uh, you guys?
Oh my God!
Why don't you tell her my name?
The Celtics.
Here you go.
Umm, yeah-no thanks.
This is from the woman at the bar.
Nice to see you.
Mmm hmmm.
Why?! Why?! He said he'd call. Why hasn't he called?
Uh-oh...
Hi.
Hey, that kid looks familiar.
I just hope...
Aaahhhh. AAAAHHHHHH.
This is your daughter? I can be your new mummy!
Listen Joey, seeing as you've got the most experience, I want you to take these dancers and show them the combination.
We could write it down for you?
Oh, way, way better than Mindy.
Uh-oh, tunnel.
I'm gonna do this now.
Just a little gag gift somebody gave me. Put your hands together.
No that's La Guardia. This is Mexico.
Okay. You've got a small, minor infection in that left eye. I want you to take these drops three times a day and you'll be as good as new.
And there is a collection of Walt Whitman letters on display at the public library.
But we broke up.
Well, that's sort of a given, but yes. Anyone else?
Well, were gonna be layin off people in every department.
How do you think I should propose?
Take a seat. You okay? You feeling all right?
So? I'm married.
Well, I would make them Belgian, but the waffles are hard to get into that flask.
Susan and I live together.
Hey, you. He's just adorable.
What?! They wanted a scary story!
Oh, please, honey, listen, if I can do it, anybody can. You just start with half a dozen European cities, throw in thirty euphemisms for male genitalia, and bam! You have got yourself a book.
Hey, Rachel.
Dr. Geller...? Charlie... What are you... what are you doing here?
What's wrong, sweetie?
I believed you were saving this seat for someone.
You see? That has a clear selling point. It appeals to our key demographic, it's.... You did you come up with that?
So Phoebe, you ah, sounded kinda serious on the phone, is ah, is anything wrong?
Incidentally, when are you coming back?
Here, I'll get it.

I thought you knew I was looking at you.
I don't know.
Yes, yes, do go on.
Great. I'll see you later!
No, it's hard enough to get women to go out with me.
You still don't know my name, do you?
What do you mean?
He happens to be brilliant. Which is more than I can say for that sweater you're dating.
I got it!
The next one's dedicated to Rachel from Ross. Rachel, he wants you to know he's deeply sorry for what he did and he hopes you can find it in your heart to forgive him.
Not to me.
Do you want to ride around town on my little pink bicycle?
Okay! We're about an hour away from getting the scene lit. So uh, if you guys don't mind, can we run it a couple of times?
This is worse than when he married the lesbian.
...in love with you.
Hey Rach, hey you.
Yeah, but you can come and visit me. I bet that you could uh, own a few places down there.
When the Cretaceous period ended, the dinosaurs were gone.
Well, you're practically dancing already. Why don't you just do it over here?
Hi, Phoe.
Oh! Wow! Hey!
Oh thanks! I like your top.
Don't talk to me now!
How could you have kept all of this from me?
Hey, hey Ross.
I don't know, they're just a little blah!
Okay lady, you're out of here.
Well, I'm staying with you guys!
There is no Philange!
What?
My joke wasn't funny.
Okay!
Oh. Whew!
Shoot! Shoot! Shoot!
Welcome everybody, welcome to Amazing Discoveries!
How you doin'?
I don't know, what's a koondis with you? Please, lie down! I've got a sav that oughta shrink that right up.
The picture of my wife! In your pack!
For what dear? For not inviting me or lying about it?
Mmm.
Hey, what's going on?
That's fine, for now we'll just call her Baby Girl Green.
Grazie.
Ooh, steer clear of you.
Hi Joey, what's goin' on man?
Yeah.
Could you leave a note? 'Cause I'm on a lot of pain killers now, and I don't know if I'll remember this tomorrow.
Oh, we have our babies.
Hi!
Good luck buddy.
Here Mitzi! Here Mitzi!
Hello.
You, get out of my shop!
After what he just said, you're paying for the whole bloody lot.
Oh, yum-yum-yum.
I know, we did it!! Hey, that was incredible, huh?!
Stop it, stop it! He talks slow but he might pee fast! Ok, let's go!!
Rachel Green's office.
I've never seen it!
Okay, so since umm, you're not going to jail tonight I was wondering if you would like to go to dinner with me?
Vic! Vic! Vic!!!
Yeah, any messages for room 226?
My god, what happened?
How you doin'?
I don't think so. Although, they did mention something about two heartbeats. But I thought that was just mine and the baby's. They kept saying both heartbeats are really strong, and I thought well, that's good 'cause I'm having a baby.
When they're hookers.
...and even though none of the other kids believed me, I swear to God, that duck pushed me!
So, we're on our way to a couple of parties. Um. . . maybe we can get your numbers and give you guys a call if we find something fun.
Oh.
Well, I don't know what's in the boxes down here, but I do know there are six or seven Easy Bake Ovens in the attic.
Uh, Phoebe, uh... you're an amazing woman, and the time we spent apart was, was unbearable. Of course the sanitation strikes in Minsk didn't help!
Hi!
Sir, this is not a first class ticket. I'm sorry.
No, no-no, no-no, my point is that I kept coming back because, I wanted to see you.
Yeah, I hated her. She was horrible to me in high school. But hey, it was a long time ago, I'm in a good place, it might be actually fun to see her again. You got any cakes or cookies or something? No Will no!
So I understand you're looking for a place.
Uh, yeah. Now you guys dance over there, you guys over there, and I want you two right around here, and everyone else spread out.
This poor guy's been in a coma for five years. It's hopeless.
One, two, three...
Huh?
It seems your daughter and Richard are something of an item.
We really do feel bad about this though.
I left a Belgian waffle out here, did you take it?
What kind of surgery?!
Ah Monica, my star student.
'Cause every time I see your face, I can't help but fall from grace. I know.....
No.
Ow, ow, ow, ow, leg cramp, leg cramp, leg cramp.
Really?
You suck!!
Oh my God!
"Hi Joey, it's Jane Rogers can't wait for your party tonight"
Yeah.
Well um, I was in ah Mrs. Knight's ah, I mean Alice, sorry, Alice, I always do that. I was in her ah, Home Ec class.
Are you all right?
I promise.
You're next!!
Look; you got stood up, who cares? We're gonna show you a good time. Just sit and relax. In fact, let me bring you a crab cake appetizer on the house.
Take your shirt off, and let's see what we're dealing with here. What are you doing?
Clearly you've never been to Sandles Paradise Island.
A lesbian?
Wow! Didn't she die like five years ago?
Someone I can spoil, y'know?
Well...I really have high hopes for my band.
You told on us?
Oh, here is your beautiful baby. Congratulations!
It does. It feels really good!
Right.
We will.
Okay, okay... when Barry was engaged to you, he and I...kind of... had a little thing on the side.
Hmm.
Ah, just one other thing.
You can come to my house!
Hey guy!
Ok, I have to sleep on the west side because I grew up in California and otherwise the ocean would be on the wrong side.
I'm okay. I gotta go down to the police station and look at mug shots.
Actually the wet season is June to December.
Hold on. Fill these out, sit over there.
Well, I'm sorry. I just thought I'd try to make the place a little nicer.
Well, hey, at least you're getting a proper wedding. I mean, you really deserve that.
Hi!
In a minute. You-you checked today's Post?
Umh... Kurts Baley?
Chandler, hi! I'm sure you've heard we filled the three positions. We just felt that with your maturity and experience, you wouldn't be happy being someone's assistant.
It's the baby's buttock, she's breech.
She took all my stuff.
Hi, it's Eric. From the Halloween party, Ursula's fiance.
Cute assistant! What's his story? Is he...
Ah, just some basic dehydrating of a few fruits and vegetables. MAN ALIVE this thing's fantastic!
Oookay. Are you aware that possession of an illegal exotic is, uh, punishable by up to two years in prison and confiscation of the animal?
Yeah!
That's funny. Who are they?
Whoa, whoa, whoa . She cringed!
You okay, kiddo?
Alright.
All right then, we'll have a definite answer for you on Monday, but I think I can say with some confidence, you'll fit in well here.
It's really nice to see you again.
No, I told you...get out!
And that's not all I'm allergic to.
Ready?
Hello? Yeah, um. Hang on one sec. Can I take this upstairs?
This isn't fair.
I am afraid you are gonna have to take a seat.
So, tell me a little bit about yourself.
You are now.
I'm telling you, I need some smacks. I got a kid starting Dartmouth in the fall.
...because I have a list of five goofy coffee house guys and yesterday I bumped you for that guy over there.
Very busy.
Uh-huh.
L!
Uhm... I can't do anything tonight.
What's with him?
It didn't click.
All those things I said about not being ready...
Well, it was nice meeting you.
Nice to see you Rachel.
Er, uh, I'm just gonna go. Sorry.
So, the Etch-a-Sketch is from you guys?
That's just the way it is.
I know. I know! I'm a duplex.
I'm sorry.
So what do you want?
Actually its, Vatican City. Now ahh, what do you know about vulcanised rubber?
Ross, we...we have to be strong. Okay, I-I'm gonna go. Can I? To remember you?
I just got a call to be a dancer on a television special for New Year's Eve. It's called some sort of Dick'n Rock'n Dickie Eve.
Excuse me?
Hey!
Min. Oh Rach, you're still here, at our wedding, they were packing up the chopped liver about now.
Hey beautiful.
Ohhh, you're having a parteee.
Oh, Chandler, look. You and Monica are meant to have children. I am sure it's gonna be just fine.
Okay ladies, that ends today's class, and let's remember, let's be safe out there.
Oh, ow! Did Joey tell you to say that? You guys, are too much!
Well, I would like to propose a toast to the woman, who in one year from today, become Mrs. Dr. Barry Farber DDS
Oh, that is so not true.
You know, by the way. I heard you tell her not to do anything. Thanks for sticking up for me. You are such a nice person.
Well, I believe that the answers lie in the osteological evidence. I plan to begin there.
I get the joke. Sophisticated as it was. Now the thing I wanna say is... maybe we should have talked about this before. Us living together, you're not expecting a proposal, right?
Mushroom. Smile. They won't all be like this. Some women might even stay through dinner. Sorry, that's not funny
Are you sure?
No you didn't.
Yeah!
I'll be right back.
Sure.
Hello? Rachel?
Sooo, Richard's shopping in the junior section.
What?! I've never seen one before!
Yes.
Awww.
Yeah, ummm, I don't like the hat that much.
Oh.
Ross, why don't you give us your toast now?
What's different?
Hi!!
Congratulations you two!
Hey! How's my pal Toby doing today?
You want me to cancel it?
Can I get you some coffee?
Yeah, it sure does.
Well why not you changed Ned's grade!
Phoebe, hang on a second. Here, take my car, go pick up your friends.
We must go now, quickly, please.
Actually, it turned out to be a lot of fun!
Okay.
You're taking this all wrong. Because, if I didn't leave you that tip, you wouldn't of come down here, we wouldn't be having this argument, and there wouldn't be this ah, heat between us.
Oak, maple, elm, birch...
Well, it was great seeing you the other night.
Alright, then I'm gonna change my name.
That's about 60 cents.
Rachel stop!
Right, at the end, you choked on a cookie.
Philadelphia.
Joey and Janice's DAY OF FUN!!!
That's really a day shoe.
You're so welcome.
He started it!
You know what? When I moved in here I thought: This is gonna be so great. Just us sisters, back together again like when we were kids, except without that stupid Jill... Oh! Who has gotten fat by the way...
You can't sit here if you're not gonna play.
Yeah.
Someone does. Me.
You gotta take the canoe!
I have no idea what you're talking about. But I, but I just got Phoebe Buffay's autograph!
I just remembered, I have to do something.
No, it's really good.
So. I guess I'll see you around.
Hi, I'm Sally. So, no ring. Can I assume you are also a single parent?
There's an indoor pool, you can swim there!
That would be great! Also, uh, I was hoping to catch a show so if you can make any suggestions...
Oh my God, this is so cool!
You're right. She probably will support me. Hey, unless we move in with you, dad?
I was just being polite, but, alright.
And you are...
Where did you have it?
Oh, sorry, I didn't realize.
You're a mean old woman.
Yes.
Thank you so much!
You bitch. You just think you're so perfect. With your new baby and your, your small apartment. Well let me tell you something. Your baby isn't even that cute.
You are?
Didn't I just throw you out of here?
Dysprosium.
I just came by to give you a kiss, I have to go pick up the baby, so. I'll see you later sweetheart, you too Chandler.
I do have feelings for you.
Can he handle the stick?
Okay, but I get to hop on after her.
Oh God! I am so sorry, but... I mean it's... there's so much history between us, you know...
Good, because it's in ten minutes.
Hey.
What?
If you're a professional chef, what are you doing taking Introduction to Cooking?
Chandler, we've been here for an hour doing this! Now watch, it's easy.
What's green and says "hey, I'm a frog"? A talking frog! Oh, no, you can't have him, he's too funny.
"Monica, it's Richard. Call me."
Wow!
This is impossible. Its just impossible.
Here we go, one Hazelnut Latte.
Normal.
Well, I'll see you later.
Ooh! Are you sure?
You tell your friend Chandler that we're definately broken up this time.
Now-now calm down. Come look in my office, some of it my still be in the trash.
It's nice to see you're not still wearing that denim cap with all the little mirrors on it.
Push, push!
Mmmm... Ethan is my... boyfriend.
I am?!
Oh, okay.
You know, nothing makes God happier than when two people, any two people, come together in love. Friends, family, we're gathered here today to join Carol and Susan in holy matrimony.
I'll be okay.
Who is this?
You okay there, slugger?
Phoebe called me.
I hate you!!
Put some pants on kid so I can kick your butt.
What'd I get?
Oh, and he's got such a good heart! Doesn't he have a good heart?
I have no idea, I went to the bathroom. So sweetie, you were starting to tell me what is uh, what is new with you.
Well, I went over to Kyle's last night to pick up a few things and we got to reminiscing...
If you're talking about feminism, I think you're right.
No I didn't.
I!
Yes it is.
Have the final numbers on my desk by Tuesday.
But like how?
Well actually they're taping tomorrow. I don't really understand why.
What?
Or?
How do you fix the chair?
Hey! Hey! Hey! This is 92.3, WXRK, K-Rock for our $1,000 daily challenge.
It's a filthy, disgusting habit and I want you to quit now!
It's a nice watch, I don't wanna break it on your ribs.
Happy Thanksgiving!
Yeah, it's here in the paperwork we got from the clinic in Ohio.
For what?
Who is the father? Oh no! Please don't tell me it's her!
Isn't the Mastodon from the Pliocene Epic?
What's the matter with him?
Sit down.
I can't believe we go on in, in a week.
Yeah, the list that-of people we're allowed to sleep...
Ah, good to meet you. Robert.
Car accident.
Come on, Erica, start pushing again now.
It can be anything you want.
No. You?
You wanna get married?
Amber, I want you to know that I'll always be there for you, as a friend and as your brother.
This is the final boarding call for Flight 664 to Yemen.
She went to pick up Aunt Liddy.
I don't understand.
Hi!
Yeah, okay.
Hey, hi, I need a ladle. You got a ladle?
No, I ahh, had another idea.
Oh, well I thought that ah...
It's textbook.
We took a road trip to Las Vegas man.
No! Why can't the Armadillo leave? I want Santa!
I assume we're talking about the baby now.
Bye guys.
Okay, I love you. Is that so bad?
Hey!
Ginger.
Stop it!
Okay.
Yeah, that sounds about right.
Well, Telia Shire suddenly became available.
He proposed to you? This is the worst birthday ever.
Sorry, what?
Ow!
What?
I know! I can't wait!
You said two weeks.
Hey, Chandler!
Oh yeah, well who serves steak when there's no place to sit, I mean how are you supposed to eat this?
Hi!
Well, there is a chance it's another guy. I mean, I have only ever been with two guys, but they sorta overlapped.
That's... my boy.
Dahaaa! I'm going to find the men's room, be right back.
Okay.
Of course.
Who?
Bodington's! Woohoo!
And heres the float with the stars of the popular daytime soap Days of Our Lives .
Guys. Seriously, it is not like that.
You look beautiful this evening.
Ok, that's ok. I'm fine. I'm... oh!
I'm looking for Eddie Minowick.
My God! You love me!
No.
Maybe people... found it weird.... So, why do you want to leave Ralph Lauren?
Okay.
Umm, Ginger's gonna take over this corner.
Uh, Rachel, sweetheart, could I see ya for a minute?
Uh.
I know! I know! And then you lose your apartment! And then you lose your job! And then your ex-wife gets married so fast! And now the coffee-ahh!! Ross, we need to talk.
No, the place is not open 'till Tuesday. Am I not saying it right.
I really can't say.
Speaking for my people, I'd have to say no. By the way, your friend Brian from Payroll, he is.
Hey!
What?!
Oh, sure. I'm showing it to someone else right now, but please, look around.
Okay! Thank you! That was great!
Alright, but after this I want to see you outside. If the rain stops.
Yep. I'm gonna wear these on our date tonight.
I just came up to say, "Hi!" Hi! And you, sweetie, I'll see you tonight.
Thank you!
Okay.
Here, let me. Rachel Green's line, how may I help you?
You're paying for that.
Yeah-yeah, it's this huge place, and-and it's got this gorgeous view of the park, and very, very romantic. What do you say?
Oh no. I feel it isn't really anybody's business, y'know.
Well, her favourite flower is the camellia. From the poem...
And it didn't feel so girlie during the Gulf War.
I left a bra drying on the shower rod, you don't think your son will think it's yours and be horribly traumatised?
Ross, there's one thing that really scares me still.
Well, the biggest news is still you dumping Barry at the altar!
Yeah, people get pretty generous around the holidays. And it never hurts to wear tight trousers.
He is? Why?
Sure!
Joanna passed away last night.
Bye.
Yeah, I don't know why, I'm sorry, I guess I just didn't want to lose face.
I'm all done.
So, except for the fermentation process, beer and ale are basically the same thing. Fascinating isn't it.
Who are you?
Hi!
Maybe because you've got the keys?
Oh, yeah! Let's do it!
Well, I sold four of them on Ebay. You'll be sitting next to HotGuy372.
Why?!
Knicks fans, please turn your attention to the big screen on the scoreboard. Someone has a special question to ask.
What are you doing?
Oh, you're going to Minsk?
Hey, so what'd I miss, what'd I miss, c'mon?
I was, uh, checking out that insurance company's Christmas party on three, oh, it was really beautiful, they have all these decorations and this huge tree and I just, uh... to hell with them, we have to work. -- So I stole ther ham.
Monica, all this food looks wonderful, you should think about doing this for a living.
My best shoes, so good to me. I wear them everyday. Down at the heel, holes in the toes. Don't care what people say. My feet's best friends, pals to the end. With them I'm one hot chicky. Though late one night, not much light, I....
Oh, good. Thisll be fun.
But I'm not gay. And I especially wouldn't want you to think I was gay.
Well, anyhoo, um, we are looking for a couple of chefs who can create some Thanksgiving-themed recipes. You think you might be interested?
Sooo!! Anyway...
Oh, well, is it what we thought it would be?
No, no that was the first.
Oh, yeah!
Oh yeah we do. C'mon.
But they're so dull, they're all opthamologists.
No, no?
See, this is just the kind of thing I was talking about.
I've heard the speech: "if he knew it was gonna be the last time he saw her... "
May I have the rings? Emily, place this ring on Ross's finger as a symbol of your bond everlasting. Ross, place this ring in Emily's hand as a symbol of the love that encircles you forever.
3, 2, 1. Happy New Year.
Oh, my ex-wife didn't work, unless you call turning into her mother work. Fine. Tomorrow night then.
Oh, wow! You remembered! Oh! It's a Judy Jetson thermos!
It's just so weird, two people look so much alike, and so different.
Rachel?
Hi.
I-I-I don't think so.
No, I think it's cute.
W-w-w-wait! Why?!
He says he was too.
Why?
Think I better go before mommy starts weeping.
Hello, is Ross there?
Rachel?
Oh, umm, all right.
So, I'll call you tomorrow.
C'mon. Let her. Yeah.
Yeah, leave!
Ohhhh!
You can?
"A donation has been made in your name to the New York City Ballet".
You don't secretly smoke do you?
Jack, look at this.
Chandler, what-what are you doing?
You went out with her?! We had a pact!
Whoa!
You need both hands for that?
Well, I don't know tonight when they yelled cut and we didn't get to kiss, I was really, really, disappointed, and I just, really wanted to kiss you
that is so wrong and on top of that his a glue sniffer.
Well that's uh, that's a good point. Um ok, well, uh, I guess I got the wrong apartment then. I, I'm, look, I'm, ya know, I'm sorry, I'm terriably sorry.
Bye... Bye dear.
There's a third guy?
Well, now we've gotta find something fun for you!
And finally that you were unable to consummate the marriage. Well, that makes sense since you're gay and addicted to heroin.
...Like, ...all of them?
Am I allowed to drink anything?
"Spuds" is your grandmother?
Ohh that's so sweet!
It's uh, it's already been roasted.
Boy, somebody's gonna get a big fruit basket tomorrow.
Why should we?
Who is it?
You know I'm trying to think of the last time I opened a door and you weren't there, Phoebe are you ok?
OH.....MY.....GOD!!
No that's my assistant.
You don't think I'm cute?
Oh look, look there's your old makeup kit!
How do you know?
Hey, do you need me to pick you up?
Do I know you?
Absolutely. I love the way you kiss.
My god in heaven.
Cut! Wonderful!
You're an Aquarius, huh?
Oh, your baby's so cute. Why did you put a pink bow on a boy?
Could ya?
Actually, I'm not here to complement the chef.
Did you get the grant?
All right, I'll tell her. Come on bugger face!
Alright. Now I would like to see you wearing nothing but them. Take your clothes off.
We want you to speak to a psychiatrist.
Do you have a sec?
Oh my God. You listen to me, Chandler, you listen to me. One of these times is just gonna be your last chance with me.
I like Ross.
Yeah, y'know. Happy holidays from Mona and Ross. It'll be cute, okay?
So, I'm surprised you agreed to have lunch with me.
Go ahead. Try a piece. Yeah, we think that Mockolate is even better than chocolate.
Push. Push. Come on push for five seconds. 5...4...
Ross.
No Joey! I knew you wouldn't be supportive!
I really appreciate you taking the time to do this.
I am Guru Saj.
I'm sorry.
Okay.
I know. This has been the best year... THIS HAS BEEN THE BEST YEAR OF MY LIFE!
Yams!!!!
All right! Let's try this again! You ready Joe?
It looks like one of her eyebrows fell down. Now unless someone convinces her to let me bleach it, Jean-Claude Van Damme is gonna be making out with Gabe Kaplan.
Well, I'm still sorry. Is he here?
I've uh, I've come to talk to Ross.
Hey! Me too!
Sorry, prom queen.
Hey Joey.
Oh, yeah! Right!
What? Oh my God, there's really money in here.
Mr.Douglas... ..cool tie.
No, no, that's just Chuck Magioni, I-I sold him a house last year! And I'm very sorry, but I don't know where your Father is, and that's the truth.
Y'know you could totally sell this. It'd be perfect for like umm, a kitty litter campaign.
You too.
Hi.
No.
Yeah! Welcome, it is Soap Opera week here on Pyramid, let's meet our contestants. First, Gene Lester is a database specialist, he's gonna be playing with "Days of Our Life's" star Joey Tribbiani!
Y'know what? We need to move on.
Hey Joey, I want to talk to you.
Uhm, what was that?
Isn't there?
Uh, I gotta apologize for Kara's coffee. Y'know, I feel sorry for it if it ever got in a fight, it's not strong enough to defend itself. Did you hear what I said Bing?
It's never gonna happen again right?
Dance with your father.
I'm not a temp. I was transferred here from another department.
This may surprise you, but re-hiring fired employees, is not my main job.
Not really. You...you're blurry, but you still look like Ursula. You're Blursula. Okay wait. Maybe...If I-if I just don't look at you for a while. See? It...it works. I'm not, I'm not angry at all anymore! This is a great date!
Are you guys going to Chandler's for Thanksgiving?
Oh that's great!
Listen, um about the hair straightener, honey.. I really need one. I'm going to have dinner at my boyfriend's house.
I er... I hope you don't mind. I used some of my home-made lotion on Emma. It's a mixture of calendula and honey cream. It'll dry that rash right up. Plus... It keeps the hands young...
One of the best, ma'am, one of the best...
OH...MY...GAWD!!
Yeah, I read some great applications, but then I thought "who better then a minister to raise a child!"
No! I did!
According to recent findings!
You're a very sweet person Ross, umm, unfortunately I don't think I can take another second of you whining!!
Please stop it!
No you answer it and take pledges.
But uh, this is a study for identical twins.
I can't!!
Mar-gha.
Your lipstick's on his mouth.
You don't?
You, you want, you want me to move out?
Ross, are you there? Ross, I don't know if you can hear this but... I'm gonna talk anyway, uh, I'm in the States with you sister and your friends and it's all over with Colin. I came here to tell you that, and to tell you-Yes, Joey you can have all the chocolate you want, just take it! Uh, I came here to tell you that I love you.
But Rachel I thought she just had a baby with Ross.
Just so I know, if I had asked first...
Okay!
Oh, my baby!
Hi, oh, I'm Lauren, Kate's understudy.
I think you know.
So, eight days late huh?
You do realize that you won't have access to our new full service Swedish spa.
Sometimes I think that.. Oh, no, no, no, I can't say it, it's too horrible. No.
Oh, I'm Ronni. Ronni Rappelano? The mistress?
I know, my daughter's told me about it when they received their impromptu invitations a month ago.
Ma'am, I assure you, the plane is fine.
It's just not really who I am. Y'know, I've always been happier when...Why am I telling you this? You don't care about this stuff.
He's got a girlfriend!
Please... go! Just let me know if you need a hand!
Well no, just-just that one. But, it was stupid. Let's see, how did it, how did it go. Umm.
I'm the student.
Sure. What?
Y'know, I don't think I want the lipstick that much. But umm... Oh, would you do me a favor? And umm, would you, would you give Lilly that, please?
Mom, I'll call you later. Yeah. Yes?
Uh-huh. G-good deal.
No no no. Talk... dirty.
Uh, Phoebe, uh, I have... something I wanna say.
When's your birthday?
Oh! That was Lambchop!
I will flip you for it.
Oh yeah, yeah uh, it's down the hall and uh, second door to your left.
She's supposed to be with you.
You too.
Oh Ross...
Put your balloons down!
That's the one.
No, that's cold, that's cold, that's...
It's you. This is yours.
This almost never happens!
Hola! Hello. Hello?
Yeah.
Bye.
Oh yes there is!
Oh, that's great. I'm stalking the wrong woman. I am such a dingus!
Yeah. Hate him.
Well... hey, the key works...!
Well hi, I'm Jenny Boone. I'm the new teacher here.
All right you two, I'm gonna get going.
Phoebs.
You did a good thing today.
Ehh, y'know after high school, you just kinda lose touch. Oh yeah! I ran into Richard Dorfman.
Well, Octavio, 27&7-Oh! And there's this great little place, Alessandro's.
Ohh honey come here. Ohh it will be ok. We've all been there.
Yeah, me too.
Joey!!!
So... your resume is quite impressive.
She's gonna be fine. Okay, she's in a more difficult position so you're gonna have to push even harder now. Go! Push!
Neither of us like Ross!
Excuse me, you're Monica Geller aren't you?
Hope you had a nice flight.
Oh great! Oh, you. Umm, what's up?
And also, congratulations on your wedding.
Oh God, Ross I am so sorry.
Why don't we do a trial run.
Yeah! I've been working so hard this semester. I really need to go crazy y'know, blow off some steam.
Alright, fine. I'll call you back.
Oh, we were so sorry to hear about your parents splitting up, dear.
Damn it!
We started a rumor.
Count faster.
Well, I think you're better off without him. Oh honey, I know he's your daddy but, but to me he's still the irresponsible creep who knocked up your mom and stole her Gremlin.
Okay Rachel, are you comfortable?
Hello Emma. Happy eighteenth birthday.
Oh my God, you're the sister!
Stopping you from marrying the wrong man and making the biggest mistake of your life.
Here we go gentlemen, here we go! Are you ready? Are you ready? Let's get it on!!
I'll just wait to put your order in.
Stop it!
Vic! Where have you been, baby?!
Ohh, okay. Something didn't quite add up there.
Hey!
Really?!
I took your advice, I left Myron.
What?
I'm told there are two sides to this story, but all I've heard is that Ben's a bit of a poo-poo head.
Hey Chandler, what are you doing here?
Ohh! Yes of course, thank you, thank you, thank you so very much.
So where's the young lady who I'm supposed to take downtown!
What?! Why?
Okay, you're dancing with that girl over there.
Awesome!
Can you be my dancing partner?
They all had a thing for him.
Why? Are we done for the day?
Your monkey found a new career, in the entertainment field. That's all I know.
The Velveteen Rabbit. I kinda have the feeling you had something to do with it.
Yeah, you still have feelings for me. And-and to be honest, I-I still have feelings for you. And I wish that we can work it out Ross, but we can't. It's too complicated with you and Rachel and the baby, I-I just... It just wasn't meant to be.
You did!
Where are they?
Ow. Um, it's just my lens. It's just my lens. I'll be right back.
Umm, no.
Because I think about shaving it all off again sometime.
Champagne?
Yeah.
Right.
I'm Dr. Miller. Monica told me you were a little nervous, but don't worry everything's gonna be just fine.
That's weird.
I am so sorry. The doctor insisted on closing the curtain for the exam.
No, not getting my bra!
Hi! Hi. Hi, Rachel! What's she doing here?
So last I heard you were gonna get married. Oh poor Ray-ray.
Five! Four! Three! Applause!
Well, everyone seems to be enjoying your dish.
Mmh... he does have a pretty serious latex fetish.
What?
Uhh, Rachel, my parents...
Why?
Great!
Excuse yourself, and go to the bathroom.
Don't worry about it. It's not a problem.
Oh, shoot, we gotta go, got a reservation in 30 minutes.
Hello Tilly.
Well, he may be now, because I think I hit him with my car.
Ok, unless you're not gonna try to get me to join a cult are you?
Ice chips, just ice chips. They're at the nurses' station.
Action!
You gonna slice them up real nice?
Surprise!!
Yeah, but you're back's a zero. You're gonna wanna even that out.
Great! Come on in!
Oh, no-no, y'know I absolutely adore Rachel it's just that, well it might be a awkward for you. But it's absolutely your decision. More tea?
So, why do you let her go to a chiropractor for?
Hi.
Are you remaking the bed?
Well, I'm sorry I brought it up. So, are either one of you planning on staying at home with your child...
Wait, you're not 'G.Stephanopoulos?' Man, my dad's gonna kill me!
I don't want you taking that thing.
Oh, there they are! I-I dropped my keys.
Good luck.
Shhh.
Congratulations. I'll give you two a minute.
Well um, why don't you call me in 20 years and tell me if you're still upset about this.
Uh, Phoebe, I don't think your mom would want you to see what's about to happen.
