But... you suck!
God! Look at all these tickets! It's so exciting! You know I haven't won anything since the sixth grade.
Ok, but if something gets broken, and then the Queen comes over..
Phoebe, where's your purse?
I wish we at least knew his name... Look at that face. I mean, even sleeping, he looks smart. I bet he's a lawyer.
A mirror?
See? This is exactly why I'm making this candy. We can learn their names and get to know our neighbors.
Oh, crap!
What are you doing?
What took you so long?
Oh, that's great! Congratulations!
Hey!
Yeah you will! And, are you kiddin' me?!
Oh yeah, of course. I'm fine it's just that-
Phoebe, I did not have sex.
This is me in The Sound of Music. See the von Trapp kids?
Oh, I love museums!
I don't know, I lost it all ok. I lost it.
And when I told her that I was gonna be moving in with Chandler, she was really supportive. You were so great. You made it so easy. And now you have to leave. And I have to live with a boy!!
What's this?
