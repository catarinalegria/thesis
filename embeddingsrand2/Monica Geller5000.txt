Dammit, dammit, dammit!
Good for you, Joey.
Oh that is so sweet!
All right. I know you're not happy about us moving, but you're the only one who hasn't seen the house.
Thank you. I think I just had a tiny orgasm.
Oh, it was great! The widow wouldn't pay, so Phoebe yelled at her 'til she did.
Hey, what's this?
You do?
A wuss? Excuse me for living in the real world, okay?
Oh no, she's out having drinks with Carl.
I'm sorry but...nothing.
Oh My God!
Ok, I don't wanna be negative so I'll say that most of the signs you bought are good.
Hi!
Ok. Oh boy. You are doin' so good. You wanna squeeze my hand? All right, Ross, don't squeeze it so hard. Honey, really, don't squeeze it so hard! Oh, Ross! Let go of my hand!
Hey.
Ross? Let's go.
No! You are not gonna run out and leave her here!
You know, I knew a girl in high school who did that. She was very popular.
Jean-Claude Van Damme. I didn't know he was in this movie, he is so hot.
Hey, you better hope that we're pregnant, because one way or another, we're giving a baby back to Rachel.
Wait what-wh-wh-what are you doing?!
And so, we're hiding in the bathroom.
Ok, this is pumpkin pie with mockolate cookie crumb crust. This is mockolate cranberry cake, and these are mockolate chip cookies. Just like the Indians served.
And I assume, Chandler, you are still boycotting all the pilgrim holidays.
What are you doing?!
Um-hmm.
Look, I wanted to tell I'm-I'm sorry you lost.
That is completely untrue. You think I'm high maintenance? Okay, prove it. I want you to make a list and we're going to go through it point by point!
Oh yeah, of course. I'm fine it's just that-
Hey, have you guys eaten, because uh, Richard and I just finished and we've got leftovers... Chicken and potatoes... What am I wearing?...Actually, nothing but rubber gloves.
Shut up, and put my table back.
For this weekend! Oh gosh, it would be perfect, we get to see Joey plus we get to start our anniversary celebration on the plane. We can call it out plane-aversary.
It sure is nice to do this together, isn't it?
Well good, here let me help you out.
I swear you said you had the keys.
This is so unfair! She's got everything I want, and she doesn't have my mother.
Nope, she doesn't have to, I found out who the father is.
I think so.
Maybe a Hello Kitty doll, the ability to walk...
Oh my God! That's Pete! But why is Bill huggin' Pete?
Oh God! He's gonna come by and borrow some candles for his big date!
Monica.
It's Danny.
Groomsman, groomsman, why are you just standing there, where is your bridesmaid? We've got a broken arrow. Bridesmaid down! Oh, that's me.
It's gonna be weird to watch some actor pretending to be Ben's dad.
Yeah you will! The right guy is just around the corner! Okay, are we done with that?
How do I tell Chandler that it's too soon. It's gonna break his heart, he's not gonna think that I don't love him anymore.
Morning.
Check your numbers! Make me rich!
Oh, when you get over this breakup we need to go shopping.
It's goin' great. Right on schedule. Got my little happy helpers.
Yeah, uh, it's actually not that big a deal.
I'm on top of the world, looking down on creation and the only explanation I can find, is the wonders I've found ever since...
Good? Didn't you hear them...I was great! Thank you so much for making me do this. That's is the best gift ever.
Oh God, you are about to get sooo lucky.
Alright.
I cannot believe that I just spent the last two days trying to figure out the recipe and it was in my cupboard the whole time!
Could you please tell me what this is in reference to? Yes, hold on. Um, they say there's been some unusual activity on your account.
Alright . I think it's a big mistake but it's your decision.
I'm sorry honey, but we're gonna take you shopping. It's gonna be fine.
Boy, that was-that was, umm... terrific.
: he has to work, there's some rush on the big ah damn it one of these days I'm really gonna have to start listening when he talks about his job.
Bouncy baby, Bouncy baby, Ooh baby baby, Ooh baby baby, Ooh baby baby.
No. I think we learned that from the sugarlips incident. I'm gonna get some tea.
No. See you don't understand.
This woman's living my life.
Would you look at her? She is so peaceful.
Joey!
Yeah, what, do you think we're stupid?
Hey!
It took me 28 years to find one man that I wanna spend my life with, if I have to wait another 28 years then, I'll be 56 before I can have a baby, and that's just stupid.
Shoot! We're out of soda.
Are you okay, sweetie?
Oh God!
Who are you talking too?
Oh, you're a grandpa.
Home is Home Star stew.
Well, you just-you put a quarter in and y'know pull-pull some handles and win like a candy bar or something.
Okay.
That was amazing!
What?
Hey Rach, come on! We're gonna be late for the eye doctor appointment!
Tomorrow night.
There's only one.
Oh my God Chandler! I can't believe it!
Okay, this isn't working. I'm still awake and now I have to pee.
Hey, Rachel, Can-can I see you for a sec?
Makes me wanna puke!
This doesn't mean anything, does it?
Oh! Oh my God! That is the most beautiful top of a head I have ever seen! Chandler, you have to see this!
Let's just do it right now. Okay? It won't be hard. Just say what's in your heart.
That's right.
Absolutely! Now get out of here you!! Okay, I'm running out of places I can touch him! Look, is there something wrong with me? I mean why am I only attracted to guys where there's no future? Either they're too old, or they're too young, and then there's Pete who's-who's crazy about me, and who's absolutely perfect for me, and there's like zip going on! I mean, seriously, does it sound like something's wrong with me?!
You are so cute! No. No, it was a fight. You deal with it and move on! It's nothing to freak out about.
I'm sorry, okay? It just-tonight was supposed to be y'know, it was supposed to be a big deal.
Seriously, what is this supposed to mean?
Oh, this terrible! Everything is destroyed! Look at this. It obviously meant enough for me to save it, and I don't even know what it is! Ohh, it's still soft. What do you think this is?
I was.
I know!!
I don't know, clean places?
Oh my God! You cleaned! Look at these floors! You did the windows! Oh, I have been begging you for months and you did! You cleaned! And nagging works!
Um, you guys, you know when I said before, "thank you, but I don't really need your help"?
Wait-wait, go back to that sibling thing.
Listen, um honey, I appreciate this but you don't have to keep hanging out with them for me, I mean, they have each other.
There was nudity!
Phoebe.
I swear, if you try it, you will love it!
Phoebe, don't get upset!
Yes I did, I'm Monica, Super Aunt.
One thousand...
Oh my God! He just said my name! Did you hear that?
Hey. Where is he, where's Richard? Did you ditch him?
No, no, no, that's Dina.
Well, I do.
Why else would we be here?
I drew you a bath!
That's not gonna work.
Oh.
This is a boy, and that's a girl.
Oh my God, I was thinking four.
Yeah.
Oh, you're breaking up with Tony?
All you had to do was buy the card!
Well, I did one time, and-and I want to start doing it more. See that's what this is about.
Uh-huh.
Oh, not at all. I have no morals and I need the cash.
I got offered the head chef job at Allesandro's.
Whoa-whoa-whoa, Phoebe you gotta take her! Y'know, I-I-I said some really bad stuff about her, but y'know Rachel has some good qualities that make her a good roommate. She gets tons of catalogs and umm, she'll fold down the pages of the things she thinks that I'd like.
Hey.
Yeah, I'm going to take a bath. I'm just going to get a magazine.
Ross, how long have you been planning this wedding?
Oh, well... um, that's all there are of these. But in about eight and a half minutes, we'll be serving some delicious onion tartlets.
Could you guys please try to keep it down, we're trying to start a Boggle tournament.
Ok, here we go. We need to sort out the tickets as quickly as possible to see if we've won. So does anybody have any ideas how to organize this? Ok, how about this: we divide them into 6 groups of 40, and the remaining 10 can be read by whoever finishes their pile first.
Fine!
Oh, you two must have been so cute running around on a barge.
Mr. Bigot. He tells the most racist jokes.
Why not?
The good stuff, huh?
No, the one who looked at you once because you got in her way.
I thought I lost it. I got a new one, like, a month ago.
You have to tell David!
That's that weird voice again.
Hey! You're wearing pants!
What the hell are you cooking!
Ugh! Well, y'know, we were away...
Happy birthday dad.
What?!
Oh my God!
I hope by maid you mean mistress, because if some other woman was here cleaning then...
I'll go in there.
You got it.
You're not dressed yet?! We're supposed to start having fun in 15 minutes!
Well, I guess we've established who's staying here with Monica...
It's unbelievable! I-I can't believe that sign didn't work!
Well fine! I want to meet this chicken expert! Send the Colonel in!
STOP IT!! ...Oh my God. It's true! Who am I?
Oh.
Yeah, right!
It's a stupid game and I wasn't playing against other people, so technically I didn't lose.
Nobody cares about the Dakotas.
What are you talking about?
Not one that can pee on the roof.
I'm gonna miss you so much.
Hey!
Oh, you look so great.
Ohh!
Rachel-Rachel-Rachel I-I cannot, I can't let-, actually I kinda want to see what happens.
Really?
They're all Chandler.
We'll call you!
We're not really gonna buy these people steak dinners are we?
Okay, let's talk about something else.
Ross.
Chandler?
Hey!
No you're fine. All right well, do you think I could take Rachel?
Thanks.
Stinky?!
Yes it is! You saw me wearing it!
Here, take a couple of these.
Wait, was this a-a small mediterranean guy with curiously intelligent good looks?
Hey you guys?
Because I don't work at the Szechwan Dragon.
Yeah... yeah, I think there is. -What were you gonna say?
Man's got a point.
I know.
We left Joey alone with the food! Yep! Yep, I knew it! There he is... feeding stuffing to a dog!
Hi Ben!
: Is this not the good part? Do you want me to fast forward to something a little toothier.
OK, what're we gonna do about this?
Let go!
Hey, don't mix those up, you could really ruin that lollipop.
What?
Hate that guy!
Old?
Well you know it's just like living with a girl. Only they don't steal your makeup. Unless they're playing "This is what my sister would look like"
It's not like I want to get married tomorrow! It's just that I-I'd like to believe that I'm in a relationship that's actually going somewhere, that I'm not just wasting my time!
Ok, it's 2100 hours. Time for your toast.
Nah... not-not special enough.
Wow, what's the bad news!
Oh.
Well, don't 'cha wanna?
Alright, wait a second, why would Ross tell everyone in your class that you are as... "gay as the day is long"?
Oh, Rach! Rach! Umm hey, could you do me a favor and would talk to Chandler's dad and try to keep him away from Chandler's mom?
Honey, what's the matter?
No.
Vividly.
Is that the one that speaks English or the one that doesn't?
Alright, here you go, sweetie.
Hey, hold on there, tiger. How's it going? How you holding up?
It's just that, it's so much.
Okay, you ready to open yours?
You look good!
Well there's not much we can do.
Noo!! The point is that is was you that was there that night! It is you that I am marrying! It is you that I feel in love with!
Where were you? We were supposed to meet in the wine cellar?
It's no big deal, I do it all the time.
People! People say it! Come here!
Hey, you wanna see something?
Well, we-we had to go back because I forget my jacket.
All right. Umm, you could uh start out with a little 1, a 2, a 1-2-3, 3, 5, a 4, a 3-2, 2, a 2-4-6, 2-4-6, 4, 2, 2, 4-7, 5-7, 6-7, 7, ...7.....7...7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7...!
I am so glad you guys got together, Chandler and I are always looking for a couple to go out with and now we have one!
Well, it matters to me!
Oh, she's gonna love that!
Well, you used to dress up in Mom's clothes all the time.
Oh, what a great argument, exhaling! All right, y'know what, I'll prove it to you, okay. I'll trade you Joey for Rachel, and I'll still win the game.
Y'know what? Y'know when I said that I want you to deal with this relationship stuff all on your own? Well, you're not ready for that.
I'm sorry. But not that sorry, 'cause you don't have to live with it. Um, we have a reservation under the name Chandler Bing.
Hey!
Ohh my God, I'm so sorry.
NOOOOOOOOO!!!!!
Oh come on, it's only fair, you paid for the flight. Now is, is that enough lire?
Phoebe I think he would notice if you didn't have a baby in nine months!
You're-you're-you're gonna bring the Barca Lounger over here?
No.
Yeah. You're just gonna have to stop pissing me off.
Everybody knows!
Oh gosh.
: yeah he has to stay in Tulsa this weekend.
All right, that I'll retract. But I stand by my review, I know food and that wasn't it. You're marinara sauce tasted like tomato juice! You should serve it with vodka and a piece of celery.
Wow! And around the ankles, y'know that is a tough spot.
All right.
Ohhh, oh my God! Oh my God! She knows about us!
Remember that guy that gave me a bad review? Well... I'm getting my revenge!
Okay. Umm, Phoebe, you suck too.
Six o'clock!
That cold makes you sound so great.
Can you believe it? ...Y'know what? I just don't feel the thing. I mean, they feel the thing, I don't feel the thing.
Oh please! Did you hear that? Little drops of heaven.
You know what? I take back what I said before. You keep playing at the restaurant, because with your music driving people inside, my bar sales are going up like crazy.
Well, now's a good time. I'm on my way to have my ears cut off.
NO, NO, NOOO!
We don't have much time. Once the egg descended the oviduct ...
What?!
Heads up Ross! Score! You suck!
Why don't you just be straight with her? Tell her the truth.
Technicality!
Did you like her? And I'm just asking as a friend, because I am totally fine with this.
"Geology rocks!"
What if I turn out the lights?
What's the charity?
Like only if the queen comes?
You are going to make a joke about my special present! Why would you do that?!
A hat! Yes! We need a hat.
She stole my jeans!
Not even close.
We didn't order cake.
I'm not going to be a part of this! You can't just bring some random guy at home and expect him to be our sperm donor!
You're getting a crush on your sister's fiance.
How?
D'you want to?
Oh my God. That was so amazing! When did you Hold on! I almost forgot loser! When did you stop sucking?
Hoyt?
He's... our age.
Joey, where are the Jell-o shots?
Hello?
What?!
Rachel, you and Mark?!
Oh my God, Phoebe!
I really need to talk to you.
Seriously?
Which one was Pete Carney?
Okay. That was her right?
You okay?
Wow! All right well, I mean, what can you do? If you lost it you lost it.
What?!! Gross!!
Ross will do it.
That's right. Get it out of your system while we're alone.
Between you and...
Because Chandler still has feelings for you!
Oh, sorry.
Yeah, ours pretty much sucked, oh, but, I did run into little Stevie Fisher. Remember him?
Uhh, not much. Uh, work's good.
Chandler!
What are you saying?
Yeah.
Wasn't there a little song?
You do?!
Really? Okay, so why don't you tell me what happened to Ross Junior year at Disneyland?
Yes! Exactly.
From the tequila factory?
Chandler what do you say?
No.
I bet this will work!
No! We're gonna have fun. We can make fudge!
Well what is it? What is it? If it's gonna help bring the baby here, like today. I mean, I think you should do it.
I gave you a key for emergencies!
You keep saying that.
Oh, that's nice!
Emily's straight.
Are you nuts?! We've got George Stephanopoulos' pizza!
Ok, so I think I'm just about done here, unless you have any bad stuff hidden somewhere, like... porn or cigarettes?
What is it? Is there something fundamentally unmarriable about me?
I've been great, just great. How have you been?
Yeah, I couldn't be mad at him for too long.
Oh, that is so sweet. Oh gosh, love you. Insurance?
Wow! You are really fast!
Here. Ben, do you wanna play the airplane game, do you wanna show Rachel? Come here. We're gonna do something fun. Okay. Weee!! Weee!!
Yeah!
Wait a minute...Joey. Joey you can't ask her out, she's your roommate. It-it'll be way too complicated.
I love it! It's huge!! Let's open it! Open it!!
I don't know. Maybe we're some kinda magnets.
No, no, no, no, no, no pressure, no pressure!
What is that?
Wanna give me a hand?
Oh God!
Okay, well, stop staring at them.
It is in the living room where there is also a light! And no one will kick you in the shin.
I know it's last minute, but we decided to have a Halloween party.
My brother, Ross.
Yeah, and y'know, if you could not mention to them that we live together, that would be great! , I was thinking we would eat around four.
Yeah Joey she's...Rachel's got this really big work problem, and it is a head scratcher. Wow! Y'know what, if we're gonna make dinner we're gonna have to leave. Yeah.
Wow, this is so weird. I just realized this might be the last time we'll all be hanging out together.
Maybe, do you need a tissue?
Nah, while you're at Ross's if you see any lying around...
See Chandler? I'm getting a lot of use out of them already! They're very practical. See, you can wear them with dresses, with skirts, with pants...
Oh, of course, it's so nice to see you again, Zack!
Okay, so what do you, what do you want to do? Let's do something crazy!
Don't touch me!
Oh, they-they sent me home.
Well... obviously!
I gotta make up the guest bedroom. Hey, Cousin Cassie is coming to stay with us a few days.
Okay! I'll be right out. I'm slipping into something a little less comfortable, and a little more slutty.
Ok, you see, the tag shouldn't be at the top left corner, it should be at the bottom right corner.
What did the doctor say? Any news on when the baby will come?
Wh?! What about my allergies?!
Because! You could get to live out my fantasy!
You're a really good kisser.
It's nice to meet you. Janine...?
That is never good.
What?
I'm sick of the signs! It's too fast, I'm happy the way things are!
No.
Okay, look at this one. This is my favourite.
Thank you.
Hi, Dad. No, no, it's me. li-listen, Dad, I can't talk right now, um, but there's something, um... there's something that I've been meaning to tell you...
Phoebe and Gary are so gonna hear about this at dinner.
I know that you're new at this, but this is completely unacceptable bath decorum.
Oh.
So, are you ready to go?
Oh, hey! Oh good, you brought food!
Why, exactly?
I wanted it so bad! Wanna go pack?
Congratulations! Wow! I can't believe you're nominated for an Emmy!
Mmm-mmm.
Alright, we have to talk.
So, how about you huh? How do you know the happy couple?
Two hundred.
Chandler, umm, I want you to take just a minute and I want you to think about how ridiculous this sounds.
It's okay. Chandler, are you afraid of me or something?
Oh, he is. And he is so dreamy. I mean, y'know what, when he left I actually used the phrase, 'Hummina-hummina-hummina.'
I can.
How'd it go?
Okay, I got it. Phoebe? All right, you pull. I'm gonna spread the legs as wide as I can. Joey? Now is not the time!
Rach! It's me! Pick up!
You need to give him money.
See now-now you're taking them away from their home.
Relax, she-she's gonna give in way before you do!
Me and Chandler?!
I can't believe we've never done this before! It's sooo good! So good for Monica!
Just uh, do the right thing.
She's just upset because she, uh, she buttered a spider into her toast this morning.
Hey.
Stop!
We?
Nana liked it rough!
You may be okay about getting hurt, but I am not okay with being the one who hurts you. That's why I can't take this job.
Chandler, what were you thinking?
Oh my God!
Mine? Right here?
I got it!
You mean the guy who kept calling you Ron?
Well, you tell a lot of jokes!
Rachel?!
Yeah.
Yeah, hi, it's Monica. I just got a page.
No, I'm wearing a wedding dress.
I'm, I'm really sorry.
What kinda stuff?
What?!
Okay. Umm, y'know, I don't think, I don't think I told you this, but umm, I just got out of a really serious relationship.
I don't know.
I need two. I'm bringing Pete. My boyfriend. I have a boyfriend now!
I don't think mine likes me either.
I know what you mean. You're like a sister to me too.
Okay! All right! Let's do it!
Oh, yeah, right! And after I took a shower this morning I just threw my towel on the floor! Oh God, it hurts to even joke about it.
No, it doesn't say where it came from. Where would we return it?
Our guy's a great dancer!
Wait. Rachel, no, he's married. Married! If you don't realise that, I can't help you.
Mmh... this cake is amazing!
I know... it's just... I thought this was, you know... it.
This bicep?
So, Chandler, who's on your list?
What is it?! What about Pete?
Newark airport. Why, where are you?
You must feel horrible. Hey! The guys have free porn!
I know. But umm, one time there was this really dirty car in front of the building, so I washed it.
Bye.
I think I'll help her out. What is going on here?
: Joey, Joey.
Okay.
Y'know what, I've got to walk out of here right now, 'cause getting over you is the hardest thing that I have ever had to do. I don't think I could do it again.
No, it's more like a good luck.
Okay.
Rachel, I need to borrow-You're not packed!!!! You're not packed even a little bit!
I don't believe in soul mates either.
Why are so mad at him?
That's me.
Look at you. All jealous.
All right... you're right. We're sorry. Now let's wake up Emma and get the fun time started!
Put your head back.
Only here.
What!? You faked it?
Ohhh, I knew you loved her! Then you need to go to the airport and tell her. You're probably just gonna catch her just as she's about to go to the gate. You're gonna call out her name and say, "I love you!" And she's gonna say, "I love you, too!" And you guys are going to have the most amazing kiss, everyone at the gate will applaud.
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god!
All right, come here!
Well that's the best part. Umm, you guys get to decide!
That's not even a word!
Oh my God, he's beautiful. Thank you so much.
Man, man that is sharp. It must have cost you quite a few debloons.
Well, I mean I guess there is no harm in putting my name down.
Thank you.
'Cause they took our apartment, I wanted to punish them. But I'm-I'm done now. They've suffered enough.
But Chandler lent you money!
C'mon up.
Deal!
Look, all we're trying to say is, don't let what happened with Carol ruin what you got with Emily.
Did I squeeze it too hard?
Yes.
Okay.
Your a poet and don't know it.
A love scene? With who?
You know what? This is not over. We will play you again, and we will win, and you will lose, and you will beg, and we will laugh, and we will take every last dime you have, and you will hate yourselves forever.
Does that sound like Janice?
Oh shut up!
Thank you. It was so beautiful. I'm going to go to Joeys and get the pies.
I don't think so.
I have some pretty exciting news!
Yeah, but y'know we could sneak in and watch.
Rachel said everything was okay.
Umhmm, umhmm, about the time you told me about New Year's Eve. Where is everybody else?
Hmm, care to make it interesting? I'll bet you that she'll have it by this time tomorrow.
So you had fun, huh?
Deal! TIME LAPSE.
You kissed him?
Chinadolor Bong, come on, we steal that TV Guide every week!
You were invited?!
No.
What, what are you doing? You can't go out there.
Hey.
See? This is exactly why I'm making this candy. We can learn their names and get to know our neighbors.
I sure do! And you don't get one!
Okay, now we just need something borrowed!
It's okay honey, you'll find a name.
Really?
Oh wow! Okay. Well that was fun.
Oh, who cares, they still love me! "I am so excited..."
When did I sign for it?
You bet your ass, I'm gonna fire you! Thank you.
Wow, you worked in a mine?
That's very nice.
Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- -I'd want yours.
What?!
Oh, Larry.
Joey, what are you doing?! It's never gonna happen, she's seeing somebody.
Well do something! Get in there!
And when I told her that I was gonna be moving in with Chandler, she was really supportive. You were so great. You made it so easy. And now you have to leave. And I have to live with a boy!!
How much?
You're an opthamologist.
Umm, I-I really don't want to tell this story.
Phoebe, it's okay that you don't want me to be your girlfriend because I have the best boyfriend.
You're not on TV.
Ross.
Where?
I don't want to say.
Oh, you know, my flock is good, I mean, yeah, my flock pretty much takes care of themselves at this point. Good flock. Flock, flock, flock.
That is so sweet.
I think so. Se, he-he's not inviting you to his party because he likes you.
So I'm kissing everyone?
That's right, she came back all by herself.
All right guys stop it. Rachel, we're very sorry that is a very insensitive thing for us to do. And y'know what? Let us make it up to you, we have two really great guys for you.
Phoebe, you get the bear, uhm, Joey, you get the robot, and Chandler and I get the dog. Ok, and the race is going to go from here to here. Now the one who comes in last, stays!
Ooh! But the band and the photographer are coming all the way in from New Jersey!
He is so cute. So, where did you guys grow up?
What kinda things have you been saying?
That's true.
This is not, what I'm wearing. I'm ovulating and Chandler's gonna be home any minute, so I thought we would try before dinner.
Hey! So what do you think?
Hi!
You become friends after?
I just checked my messages, and he said that when he gets back from Atlanta, we need to talk.
'Cause I ran into him at the bank, he is still soo cute.
Very bad.
Look, I-I'm never gonna let you up so you may as well just go away.
Okay.
Why did they get divorced?
Oh my God! You are gonna love me so much! I felt really bad about the whole bachelorette party thing, so tonight you're gonna have a bachelor party.
Alright, let me ask you this question: How many of you thought the music was fine, but not in keeping with the tone of the restaurant? .
No! No!
Does she use the cups? Yes! I believe she does. Does she use the plates? Yes! I believe she does.
I can't believe we're living here!
Yeah!
It was so wild. We told them we were the Gunnersens in room six fifteen. Only to find out the Boston Celtics had taken over the entire sixth floor!
Nooo!
Yeah, but her plane got delayed in Athens. But actually, she should be here by now.
Well, when you first met Barry, you flitted off to Vail.
We have a baby?
Yeah-yeah, you remember how I call you bunny?
So? Do you think we should get it?
Yeah, but that's pigs not people!
What am I gonna do?! That is the dress! That is the dress! Wh...Chandler wants the band. What do I do?
Just mine?
What?
Thank you.
That is so funny. Let me see that.
Don't come in here!
Maybe he's bothering you so much because he likes you. It's like in first grade when Skippy Langwild always pushed me on the playground because he secretly had a crush on me?
It meant nothing! Okay? After all this time, how can you not trust me?
What?
The game's over! Take off your robe!
Uh, Chandler did! What does he want you to give up?
I know. How could we have let this happen?
You owe me 20 bucks.
You were staring about eight inches south of there.
This wasn't addressed to Days of Our Lives, this is, this came to your apartment. There's no stamp on it, this woman was in our building.
I do not like that woman!
Do you really want to pull at that thread?
I was trying to help out a squirrel.
Guys. I thought you were taking Ross to the game?
I KNOW!
Yeah, I thought it was cute.
I guess you're right.
No. You know, sometimes just things doesn't work out.
Y'know dad, Chandler is one of Ross's very best friends!
I just wanted to see how it's going.
You came?!
Gosh, doesn't it seem like a million years ago?
Just some stuff for the party.
Oh yes! I have it right here, on ice!
About a half an hour.
You seriously changed your name to that?
Wow! Uh what, did he uh, say?
Look honey, I wanted you to hook up with Ross as much as you did. But he's with her now and you're just gonna have to get over it.
Okay, forget the specials for a minute. Umm, all right here's the thing, for the last two weeks I have umm, tried really hard to create a positive atmosphere...
The strange part was, he was really nice, umm and he looks great, but I didn't feel anything at all!
I think you're better than you think you are.
Cassie needs to stay at your place.
Hey, Rach, how's it going?
Heeeeeey!
Oh my God! What were you doing in a library?
Nooo!!
You would not believe my day! I had to work two shifts, and then to top it off, I lost one of my fake boobs, in a grill fire.
Remember it? What do you think this is, a freckle?
Hi, again.
I don't have her number, butt-munch.
Seriously, you don't think we should tell him?
Just go.
Making holiday candy for the neighbors.
Why is Ross naked?
You want some help with that?
So, Phoebe runs weird huh?
Aww!
I love you too Chandler.
And I'm going to go get drunk.
You know, Rachel, when you ran out of your wedding, I was there for you. I put a roof over your head, and if that means nothing to you... twenty dollars an hour.
Okay! Okay! Make me sterile, but okay.
Well, not anymore.
Oh, I fell asleep.
And for our two-week anniversary, he's gonna take me to his cousin's cabin for the weekend.
Oh wow wow wow!! Make room for your friend!
'Cause I was going by it the other day and I saw that there was a stock with my initials, MEG, on it and, well, sometimes I have to watch for two or three hours before it comes up again but when it does, it's pretty exciting.
Y'know what? I-I think that umm, I don't feel like going to The Plaza.
Oh, god... She's told you that already, didn't she?!
Oh, I asked one of the waitresses at work if she'd help me out.
Come on. Hello? I'm sorry you have the wrong number. Okay, I'll call you later dad. I love you.
Hey! Oh, I'm so glad you're home, I thought tonight we could finally organize these photos!
Please! I am not as bad as Ross.
Say good-bye to sore muscles!
I just had the most amazing bath.
Phoebe? Oh, Phoebe, I'm so sorry. Have you been here long?
Oh, I still can't believe my dad saw us having sex! He didn't make it to one of piano recitals, but this he sees!
Hi, honey.
Well, well Ross didn't care enough to be here, so I think he's out. You snooze you lose.
Hey, where are all my ovulation-sticks? There's only one here.
Do you want me to cry? Is that what you want? Do you wanna see me cry?
What are peanut butter fingers?!
Damn it!
Here's the plan! Okay? I'm going to leave you get a look at Brenda's bra!
Please... honey, leave the details to me. Now I wanna make this day as special for you as I can. Now, ok, I was thinking that the harpist should wear white.
Hell no, we'll pay!
Why don't you just go out with her!
I wanna wake up early and go get it for you!
Continue.
You're not just saying that are you?
You be okay?
And did he?
You start working on that list.
Ah, well if you don't clear this off, you won't be getting one of those from me. But Ben's coming over here tomorrow to play this game, this can't be there.
Chandler, listen to me sweetie, I know you can do this. Okay? You have a beautiful smile.
God, this is so hard. I can't decide between lamb or duck.
It's uh...
Now? Is it okay if I go out with Chip Matthews?
What a minute, what did he say?
Really, you want to wait a year?
Yeah, we used to perform for our family and friends.
Well that's pathetic!
Ohh, I'm sorry I couldn't think of anymore for Ross!
So, why wait 'til Saturday, are you free tomorrow?
Ross didn't scare you?
She's a stripper.
It is going to be okay! It was worth a shot.
Of course.
Well, I thought that I would cut up the tomatos.
Oh my God.
What?
Okay!
Oh God, is it 6:30? Buzz him in!
So basically, this is a getting-rid-of-everything-Rachel-ever-used sale.
Hey.
No-wait-no-no!!!!!!!
I mean, all I'm asking for is just a little emotion! Is that too much to ask after six years?! I mean what? Are-are-are Rachel and I not as close as you guys?! I mean do we not have as much fun?! Don't I deserve a few tears?!! I mean we-we told Joey, he cried his eyes out!
Oh well, maybe we can put it in the guest bedroom.
What are you doing?
What else did you think about?
Why not?!
Joey!
OH GOD NO! Nope, no, no, no. No! No, no. Nope! No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. NO! No!
He took my snack!
You can't marry him!
Okay, he was talking about rules.
Ethan?
Bedsprings, unmistakable!
Yes, you did!
Sorry! I'm just-I'm not very good at this! I'm a terrible liar and I hate having to lie to Rachel!
But more importantly to full well-rounded lives.
Sure, what do you have in mind?
Okay!
Absolutely! Yes, you say to him "I'm sorry Mike I can't live without her, she means too much to me!"
Honey?
Oh, absolutely. Yeah, you know I'm not even thinking about that thing that we're not supposed to think about.
This is Phoebe.
Well, usually when I'm this anxious, I clean!
What is going on with you?
Where were your parents?
Oh. Thank you. Ohhh, thank you very much. Oh, thank you for coming. Uh, just a second!
Something to remember me by!
Base Unit! Think Monica! Think!
Keep talkin'.
Chandler come on. We have to hem the new dust ruffle.
There's a game?
Phoebe, you got Joey drums to annoy Rachel, so she wouldn't wanna live there anymore?
He's coming. Be cool, be cool, be cool.
Yeah.
Look at this.
Oh no, wait! Joey!
Uh, good.
Can you just hold on for one minute?
Come on. I know you're not eighteen anymore, but give it a minute.
So maybe they could umm, call the award the Monica?
Clearly we were wrong.
Dead leg!!
So maybe we should just. . .
Somebody likes you!
I think it's romantic.
And now your cell.
Umm, so how long have you been working with your dad? Come on, one of us had to mention him.
I understand, but you're wishing for what we think you're wishing for, aren't you?
Bye.
No, wait, please don't go! I've got porn for you too!
My God! Chandler, we said be 'aloof' not 'a doof'.
Who is it?
But they like it!
Yeah!
Yeah but it was because I-I had an eye exam and I don't like my new eye doctor.
Don't get too cocky! Remember I won the last one! Oh, by the way, how did that feel, losing to a girl?
What are you doing?
Hey, guess what I'm doing this weekend! I'm going to this culinary fair in New Jersey.
Joey, I thought you were gonna try to be friends first!
Oh, I'd like a latte. Oh y'know what? If you're gonna talk about me, I'm gonna go with you.
W-wait. What is that?
Six? I just had it for one night. It's three.
That's right, because I forbid you to smoke again.
Okay, umm, okay, umm... It's just Joey and Ross.
Okay, hold on a sec.
Okay, good, 'cause umm, well maybe we could have a little workout of our own...
I'm gonna go into the bathroom so I can look at it in the mirror, as I eat it.
Carol moved her stuff out today.
Look, these clowns are trying to take us for a ride and I'm not gonna let 'em! And we're not a couple of suckers!
Alright, alright, alright...
Look at these authentic fake medals. I tell ya, mom's gonna be voted best dressed at the make-believe military academy.
Wow, she must have hurt you pretty bad, huh?
So what did you do today Pete?
Well, I guess we should go back in. When you gave me another chance, I guess we should do the same for Amanda.
Phoebe.
Oh that's an eye removal machine.
Hi.
Man, this sucks! Y'know if Mom and Dad don't see us on TV after we made them so jealous, I mean, who's gonna be the losers then?
What?!
Oh my God! You're water broke!
Phoebe! Put that cigarette out!
What?
Wow! Your lip went bald. Hey, thanks.
All right, that's it. You know what? Just get out of my way and stop moping.
Yeah. In fact, I like her so much you tell her I want my cookies early this year! Y'know, a box of Thin Mints and some Tag-a-Longs.
What?
What?
Hi.
I would love to do it together!
Yeah and you better watch the flirting too, cause you know, in such close quarters, it could be trouble.
Guys, what's going on?
Hey, what's going on?
Hey.
Rachel, what's going on? I mean isn't this the same Barry who you left at the altar?
With a wok? I thought you were going to read my boring book to put you asleep.
You hand-wrote it?
Phoebe! You're sick, you shouldn't play. You should just go home, get in bed, and stay there.
I'm quitting!! Woo-hoo! I'm okay!! I'm all right!!
It's an expression.
Tomorrow!
Hi!
Did they just kill off Joey?
Do you wanna go hunting?
Okay!
It's a humdinger!
Oh my God!
Okay.
No, don't say it! Don't even think it!
Well I'd probably be scared of a guy using a fake voice.
That's right. My Mom doesn't have any faith in me! Oh, that's hilarious! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.
Oh, that's great! I mean I'm-I'm sorry, but I'm so happy for you. And now I can work for you!
You're doing it again.
I'm sorry that I borrowed your gloves
Oh, is that so? Ok. If that's really what you want, then here... I give you the headset. Well, I don't really want to give you the headset. Well I guess if you're taking over, you should probably return these messages.
Hey Joey, come taste this.
Well, Rachel wants to take swing dance lessons. Which I think is a really stupid idea! It's dangerous, she's never gonna get what she wants, and who knows who she might end up hurting.
Nothing. It's fine.
Well, we thought we would all go to a picnic , in Central Park!
Oh my God, my ass is sweating! Please! Please! Can you come? It's today at four.
Hey, guys.
Because... I'm Monica Geller. It was my credit card you were using.
Just the matter of ...payment?
Hey!
Okay, umm, you're a loon.
Aw, it's soo unfair.
Oh my God! Look at all the newspapers! It must be a good review! Is it great?!
That's great!
Hi guys.
'S'going pretty good, y'know? It's nice, and, we're having fun.
Is it like for dinosaur emergencies. 'Help, come quick, they're still extinct.'
Ross, I can't believe you'd do that!
Well, so far I have uh, my bride's maids dresses won't get picked up, my veil gets lost, or I don't have my something blue.
I'm getting married next!!
I'm sorry.
Tonight?
I blame London.
Yeah with Chandler not getting paid, we could really use 300 million dollars.
Yeah, I do think it's better this way. Yeah, we're being smart. Yes, I'm sure.
Okay!
Well, you don't have to decide right now, but if you could just look at our file...
Chandler!!
Umm, why don't you give me something that would be a good reason and-and then I'll tell you if it's true.
I loved them!
Come on, was it somebody maybe you dated in college?
Ahhh!!
Oh, I love it! Thank you so much!
It's because I'm scrappy.
Oh. Hi, Mr.Heckles.
Yeah, they do seem to feel pretty bad.
Really?!
Hey. Where's Joey?
Chandler!!
Alright, here we go. We've got salmon roulettes and assorted crudites.
Hey. Whaddya doing?
You just asked me.
I like them a lot.
Well, every, every Thanksgiving um, we used to have a touch football game called the 'Geller Bowl.'
Oh God, oh God, I am sorry... I am so sorry...
You love me!
You know, on the way over here, I saw this drunk guy throw up. And then a pigeon ate it!
Hi, come on in.
Not as each other!
Oh my God! My God! We've got the house !?
Oh my God, Rachel! Hi!
What is the big deal?
Boy, I love carrots! Oh! Sometimes I like to put them between my fingers like this and-and hold them down here while I talk to you. Umm, and-and-and y'know if I get really hot umm, I-I like to pick up this knife and-and umm, I-I put the cold steal against umm, my body.
Is he gonna introduce us?
I'm Monica. I'm disgusting. I stalk guys and keep their underpants.
Phoebe, tell her!
What do you think you're doing?
Relax! It's Phoebe! Not you!
Nothing, I just heard something nice about you.
Joey, what are you doing?
Yes?
Wendy, we had a deal! Yeah, you promised! Wendy! Wendy! Wendy!
Phoebe, you are a bad ass!
We're never gonna find anybody.
Oh that's so sweet! Look Chandler I don't care if you can't cry, I love you.
Thanks!
We're-we're really sorry we fogged you.
Ooh! I'm sorry! I think, I THINK, that may have missed the table!
How'd you pay for them?
What's so funny?
Hello Greg? Hi, this is Monica from the plane? Listen, the number that you gave me 853-5... That is their old number! Jenny's been giving it out since they moved!
Isn't it? Then what about the amazing wainscotting and the crown molding and the dormer windows in the attic?
And slept with the professor.
What?!
Hey, Rache. You know what we haven't played in a while?
You guys, I am not that bad!
Okay, I got that. I'll escape over there. I'll come back over here. All right, come on Ms. Pac-Man. It's got-Right- Well, you're just a little bitch, aren't you?
Mmmmm.
Oh my God yes! Who is she?
Thank you.
Lucky bastard! Janice.
Oh, can I borrow this? My milk's gone bad.
For what?
: you don't think sharks are sexy do you?
Y'know what, let's do the catering business.
This is the most special day of our lives.
Rachel, get the book! The book!
What are you supposed to be?
Oh please, he didn't hear it! He didn't hear it!!
How?
I'm with you Chandler! I mean I can't have sex with a sick person either, that's disgusting! But I'm not sick! Let me prove it to you. We are two healthy people in the pribe of libe.
When it's your assistant, I would say never.
Are these the shoes?
Look, I'm not happy about this either, but y'know if-if Ross says he's happy then we're just gonna have to keep our feelings about Emily to ourselves. Are you cool with that?
Alright.
Over here dad.
Okay!
I know, he's too charming, but if you two start going out, then it's just gonna make it so much harder for me to hate him.
Okay...
Great!
Okay, guys! The candy is coming; I just need another 15 minutes for the chocolate to cool!
Oh, look at those little fingers and toes!
I know it is the best.
I love this friend thing!
I have to be up in seven minutes.
What are you smiling at?
Hey guys!
Hey!
Hi!
Hey Joey?
What is that?
Enough!
Claws?!
And make sure our room isn't next to theirs .
Cute PJ's! You're really livin' it up here in London huh?
Yeah sure, nature called, she wanted to see who else did.
You sold me out.
And lucky means, more cleavage?
So ah, Phoebe, how was your date?
Uhh, y'know actually I was gonna do some laundry.
Well, we had a little fight.
Joke. Joke. Blah! Blah!
I just ran into Dave and he told me that you blew him off! I mean, you listen to me! Now, I'm calling the shots! I say you leave Ross alone and go get Dave! What the hell were you trying to do?
I can't get married until I get something old, something new, something borrowed, and something blue.
Ha-ha!
WHAT?
So Chandler, I guess I'll see you at dinner.
Okay listen, y'know when you move in Rachel's room is gonna be empty, you wanna talk about what we want to do with it?
You think this is clever?
Wait-wait, guys! If-if we follow the rules, it's still fun and it means something!
If it bothers you that much, just go out and get the shoes. No. Don't do this. This is stupid! I don't have to prove anything, I'm gonna go get them...But then everyone will know. Unless I get them, and then wake up really early and put them back! ...I need help!
Because we're moving in a couple of days and it just didn't make sense.
Oh no-no-no, not Dr. Burke. Dr. Burke is out of town. The-the on-call doctor will see me now.
No it's umm, more like a wrap. Okay so uh, I'm gonna go guys.
Ohh, Please?! I'm a single mom, with a thirty year old son!!
Now?
I think the things that you said about me are really unfair, and I would like for you to give my bouillabaisse another chance.
She's in her room, why?
Oh my God!!! What are you doing?!!
Oh, you came to tell him you love him! I knew it! I was right! I'm right, right?
What?! Really?!
I'm Monica Gellar. Who do you know the bride and groom?
Like a log.
You don't know everything. Did you know that I'm going out with Rachel tonight instead of you? Hmm? And did you know that the only baby around here is you?! And did you know that I can't even look at you right now?!
Did you eat all the neighbor candy?!
Yeah, I mean yeah, I look great. Yeah, I feel great and yeah, my heart is not in trouble anymore! Blah, blah, blah! Y'know I still don't feel like I got him back, y'know? I just want to humiliate him. I wanna, I want him to be like naked and then I'm going to point at him and laugh!
Do you remember that jacket that you love so much, that you thought was too expensive?
Oh, y'know..
Hey that reminds me, I thought we could use some extra luck so I brought a wishbone home from work.
What?
Oh.
Um-mm.
She's mine!
There's more beer, right?
Never call me from that phone.
Morning.
Okay, you're fine.
Hey, have you figured out a way to tell him you're moving out?
Just come.
Phoebe, what are you doing?
I know, after you left the store, I chose different ones.
Yeah, me too.
I love you!
Quick, Phoebe, tell us before he can swallow.
Oh, you're right.
So, what do you think we should do?
Michelle! Of course, it was Michelle! Did it sound like Michelle?
Did you like learn about her family?
What?! Excuse me!
What does the red X next to Bob Greenmore's name mean?
Where ya going?
I don't know how museums work in England but, here, you're not supposed to take stuff.
: what means if he gets like a disease or kills someone. not if he gets his jollys to jaws!
I guess. Why? Who's she with?
Yep! You got the tickets?
Oh! You're awake!
Hey!
Are, are you okay? I mean, do you want me to stay?
All right, what's goin' on?
Ohh.
Chandler, if that dog's been here that long, and you haven't had a reaction, maybe you're not allergic to this dog?
No, I really, really do.
At least you took me down with you!
We'll put buckles on it.
My Sweet Sixteen! Remember, you went to third base with my cousin Charlie.
Can I ask you a question?
You what? You said you liked them.
We should get over there and see if she's okay. Just one...second! Score! Game! Come on.
Keep going.
Ok, all right. It was an accident, I swear, all right. I was putting on my jacket, and the thing, and the lamp, and it broke.
How-how did that happen?
All right, check me out.
This is great! Now she's gonna be mad at Rachel! Y'know what? And I'm just gonna swoop in there and be like the daughter she never had.
All right, that's a little sketch of the cake, umm some sample menus, umm y'know what I thought we would start out with Tuscan style finger food, and for music, here's an alphabetized list of all my CDs! I've highlighted the ones that would go really good with the food.
Or "Win, Lose or Draw".
Okay, ready?
Daddy! I don't think we need to hear about the specific positions you and mom had sex.
Um, I straightened out your shower curtain so you won't get mildew. What? To me that's nice.
Guys, you got your hair cut.
You wanna finish this right now? All right, we get a deck of cards, high card wins. What do you say?
Ohh, I'm so glad. Thank you so much for staying so calm during this. I mean it's really, it's made me stay calm. I coulda been worse!
Can I ask you a question?
This is huge!
I'm not your best friend?
Ya know, Roy saw Star Wars 317 times. His name was in the paper.
I know, I've been looking at those doors, they look pretty sound proof, don't you think?
Come on.
Okay you were right! All right, I never should have bought them! They're killing me! One toe at a time!
Okay mister! Fertilize me!
So um, who was she?
She did WHAT?
Come here, I want to show you something!
All right Rachel, you sweep behind, I'll pitch it to you, you throw it down field to Phoebe. All right. Break.
Oh, that's okay. By the way, I was just checking the shower massager.
Dinosaurs.
Wendy? -- That sounds like a girl's name.
A couple of days.
Have you guys picked a date yet?
Ah, it's an honest mistake. It could happen to anyone. All right, see ya.
Oh my God! It's true!! Oh my God you are so amazing! Oh my God, can I just ask you to do me oh, just one favor?
That's so gross!
Rach, come see who's out here!
How was your first day?
I can't believe it! I lost!
Oh my God!!
Because he's terrible! Okay, he's slow, he burns things, last night he lit my pastry chef on fire!
Let go!
So, let's do this.
Umm, Chandler, if you want I can make you some macaroni and cheese for dinner.
Yeah, I think you should keep looking!
Yeah! And I got it on sale, too.
Wow! That guy is so rude!
Y'know you're really not supposed to be back here!
He took off?
I guess I set up the video camera to try and entice Joey.
Oh, by the way. Would it be okay if I gave the toast to mom and dad this year?
Mom, it's OK.
I'd like a scotch on the rocks with a twist.
People are supposed to wanna hang out here!
Okay, I'll try.
Um, and, well there's the.. the the small matter of...
Dad, dad. We got it!! We Got It!!!
Helloooo? Yeah. Oh my God. Thanks.
You know what this is, this is us getting ready for the prom.
Do not start without me. Do not start without me.
Phoebe, they didn't make you pay for those knives, did they?
I'm fine, just a little tired, I'm okay. How's Richard doing?
Ohh, I've always wanted to go to this culinary fair that they have in Jersey!
Why?
Joey, Chandler knows I borrowed the money.
Oh my God, that's Charlie!
I'm gonna go to the bathroom, maybe I'll see you there in a bit?
Oh no! You weren't supposed to see this!
Oh my God!
I know!!! My erection is back!
Oh, wait, and I got a beeper!
Okay good.
Hey!
: Im very, very drunk right now.
Uch, you see, I'm ovulating.
I know, that's why I said again!
I can't promise anything.
What?
Well, I'm sorry, but Chandler and I could really use a weekend away. You know, to reconnect... emotionally.
We are not going to whistle.
It's a globe and, a pencil sharpener.
Including me?
What is it?
Wonderwoman!
You know!
Well, spring vacation is doing nice things with your grandparents. Spring break you're doing frat guys.
Honey, sweetie, by the edges.
Oh please, you just want more blue pins.
Thank you. This is my friend Phoebe. She's gonna be helping me tonight.
How cool is this?! We know three down! I'm touching three down!
Keep talking.
How do you feel?
Do it!
I don't want her to get a boob job! That's crazy!
That noise you just made?
Oh, sweetie. Oh, look at you. You're shivering.
Phoebe, I'm engaged!
You know what, I think it's cute, you trying to be more like Richard.
So how was Joan?
Guys, you're a few steps ahead of us.
All right, Chandler can make boxes, Ross can wrap, and Joey can lift things. Now Phoebe, go tell the guys they have to help out!
Good night!
Well, of course I do. What's not to like! I'll take her in a minute! But, you know, I think that you're giving up too easy, honey. I think that you need to fight for her!
Hey Joey, Chandler sold a story to Archie Comics!
Chandler!
Hey!
She has a better chance of sprouting wings and flying up your nose than you do of not making fun of us.
Okay.
Ok.
Chandler gets pedicures!
Alright, well, maybe I should let you and the second prettiest girl in Oklahoma get back to work.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh my God Phoebe, you're on fire!
No sweetie, you've got to win over the guy that controls C.H.E.E.S.E.! You've got to kiss some serious robot ass!
Ugh, y'know, umm we gotta get up early and catch that plane for New York.
Hon, you gotta talk to Joey.
We don't?
"To take you to his mansion in the sky-y?"
Who's Mr. Girabaldi?
Hey! How'd it go?
NOOOO!!!!!!!!
"Delta Dawn"
Oh my God! You own an Italian restaurant and you think that tastes good?! Where are you even from?
Um-hmm.
I don't know! Time to kiss a guy maybe?! What are you laughing at Pampers?
There's an ad for a naked chef?
Yeah-Oh that's right. You, you always wanted me too. Hey, I see you got your mustache back.
I don't know! I don't-maybe you're feeling a little resentful. Maybe ah, maybe you thought you'd get married first! Maybe you can't stand the fact that your formally fat friend is getting married before you!
Yeah... ..see, I was supposed to get married, but, um, I left the guy at the altar.
I know! I'll tell you something, we are gonna do that again!
This switch thing has been driving me crazy. So I turned it off and checked every outlet. Now, four of them don't work. Which means, one of them has to be controlled by the switch. So, I plugged in things in all four of the outlets that-that make noise, so that way, when I turn it on I just follow the noise and find out which one it is.
Well, no. But, um, I bet she probably does.
Ya know, I was thinking. Ya know how we always stay at your apartment? Well, I thought maybe tonight we'd stay at my place.
No-no, I-I really don't want to talk about it! I don't! Especially with you.
Wow! And you got a petticure. Your feet are all dressed up.
We're with you. We got it.
Well, we're trying to find someone to perform our wedding and they're all either boring or annoying or y'know, can't stop staring at the ladies.
Unless what?
How about fifty bucks?
I don't get older. I just get better!
Ok, let's see... Oh, the cranberry sauce, it is easy to make and no-one really cares about it.
We forgot to sign one of the admissions forms.
I just thought he was nice, y'know?
That's the nicest anyone has ever said to me!
Oh yeah right there!
What?! Why? Why is this crazy? So this isn't the ideal way to something....
I'm just trying to spice it up!
I can't believe this, just like 2 weeks ago I was watching Sudden Death, now I'm on a date with Jean-Claude Van Damme. Can you beat up that guy? Can you beat up that guy?
Joey! Now that you're here...
But, I just cleaned the bathroom.
Oh no it's not, no it's not. It's a first date. I'm sure that nothing is gonna...
Okay!!
What?! You said he was sweet!
What are you talking about?
Actually there is. Chandler usually helps me with this, but he's really into the game so I don't want to bother him. Could you help me fold these napkins?
Oh my God, what a fun day! That sounds great!
Oh, you really want to talk about getting people to like you huh, funny man?
Of course!
Jellyfish sting! Oh, it hurts! It hurts!! It hurts!!
Oh, thank god! Emma, there you are!
You used to have carpet.
Thank God! I can't watch him anymore!
Yes! Okay! Okay! Wait-wait-wait!
What?!
Hey!
Hey, you think, you can keep it another night?
I'm at work, ordinary day, you know, chop chop chop, sauti, sauti, sauti. All of a sudden, Leon, the manager, calls me into his office. It turns out they fired the head lunch chef, and guess who got the job.
Those cute little black ones I wear all the time.
We know how tough those parent/teacher conferences can be.
Oh God, neither!
Ooh, this always happens.
You still have feelings for me don't you?
All right, so what do you say?
Huh? What'd ya say Joe? I'll be right there.
Rach, are you really gonna let him do this?
Oh Soap Opera Digest award!
Honey, I'm not returning them. Okay? I mean I-I know they cost a lot, but I'm going to wear them all the time. You'll see. Besides, I love the compliments. I mean, have you ever had something so beautiful everyone wanted it?
No.
No! That's where we keep the canned goods! Have you completely forgotten everything you learned at orientation?
I am not wrong.
About what?
Did he just say 'Monica bang'?
Alright, but I'm very excited about this OK, so you gotta promise you won't get all big-brothery and judgmental.
I can't believe he has a new roommate. Who is this guy?
Oh it's not big, not at all, you know, kinda the same lines as, say, oh I don't know, having a third nipple.
Where's that?
Oh...
Noo!! It's driving me crazy. I mean every other way he's like the perfect guy, he has everything. Plus! He actually has everything.
That's Phoebe! Where did you get that?
We have too! I mean what if Ross's hears that and then calls her back and then they get back together? Is that what you want? Ross back with that controlling, neurotic, crazy Emily? The Emily that wouldn't let him see you?
I know.
Shut up, Joey!
I'm crying here!!
Ooh, umm, oh Kathy! Kathy, I love you! Oh!
Oh, oh, okay umm, so I'll see you soon.
What do you mean?
Hugh! Hugh Grant!
Hey guys!
I think that is so great! When are you gonna ask her?
What? We could do it!
Look at that! Look at that! They're going into the first class lounge! Do you know what they have in there?
Yeah, sure... uhm, I'm devastated, obviously... Did you think the neighborhood was homey?
'Cause I don't want to encourage this kind of behaviour.
How have you been?
That's it. I'm done. I don't care when the baby comes, no more betting.
Sweetie, I wanted you to have him too.
And I don't know if you've noticed but she's a HOTTY!! HI!
Oh, so much fun. But the best part is, we met this incredible couple on the way back.
All right, we'll stay. We can just drive up after the party.
We have one.
Hi.
I gotcha. Sorry. So, did you ever make him throw up a whole anything?
Chandler! You don't have to ask for my permission. You can go.
OK. Just for a little while.
It's umm, it has something to do with transponding.
Limited seating?! I am just one tiny person!
No, it's not.
300 dollars?!
You flicked me first.
She and Phoebe took the stripper to the hospital.
Chandler, we said we would meet at the coffeehouse at six.
Well, not... worried, just... wondering.
Wait a minute! My last Kit-Kat bar!
You know, I know that things could still go wrong but if they don't? If this works out, we're gonna have a baby Chandler, a baby!
Not a lot, Phoebe's kidding, Phoebe's crazy.
Ok, these were unbelievably expensive, and I know he's gonna grow out of them in like, 20 minutes, but I couldn't resist.
Wait, you can't have the baby here! I mean I haven't sterilised it since the guys moved out!
Rachel?!
: Honey why don't you just let it go and ask her out again.
Hey dad!
I guess that makes sense. So, you think you're going to talk to him?
Hello?
We heard about your pants, I'm so sorry.
I feel really sad that we're not...really there anymore.
No because it-it didn't seem important.
Well actually, Ross doesn't.
Because she's not gonna get to keep the babies.
Wow! A lipper from Chipper.
Hey!!
Oh, good. Thanks.
Wow, that is a surprise. Just one little question, uh, why not Ross's room?
Call them mom and dad you loser!
Oh good.
Ohh.
No, we weren't!
You just stay here!
Oh, honey, I forgot. I promised Treeger that we'd leave our keys.
Wow, what?
Where is the James Taylor CD?
Please! I feel so bad! Just watch the hot woman get naked!
Every year.
Aww, the only reason you want to go out with me because my blond wig, and the big boobs, and the fact that I serve you food.
You too.
Well, it's like that. With feelings.
Let's see, 1939... yeah, 24, 25?
What!!?
They could be our neighbors, what are they like?
Excuse me, where are you going?
Well, I mean what about friends of your grandmother's? Wouldn't they have the recipe?
Break!
Break!
No, they gave us glasses with lipstick on them! I mean, if they didn't change the glasses, who knows what else they didn't change. Come on sweetie, I just want this weekend to be perfect, I mean we can change rooms, can't we?
So how's it going with you guys?
Hey, come on Phoebe, you can understand why this would be weird for me.
What are you doing?! Chandler! You can't just go back a phase!
Huh. What's doofus spelled backwards?
They were lovers.
But... you suck!
Oh. What's wrong?
Why?!
I bet this will work!
I have not been sick in over three years!
Oh, what'd ya bring me?! Awww, hotel toiletries from Japan. Oh, these are gonna go in my permanent collection. You want some coffee?
Okay, what if the person who adopts the other one is horrible?
Don't you love the huge yard?
Well then, y'know what? I care about you to much to watch you hurt yourself like this. So if you have to do this, then you're gonna have to do it without me.
Great! Well Rachel, the reason why I won't let you drive the Porsche is because you're a terrible driver. There! That wasn't about the wedding.
Oh I love taking limos when nobody died!
Me neither! We have to get in!
That sounds like Nana.
What do you mean?
All right.
Same category?
Hmm, I don't know. We really have to talk this through.
Phoebe, Sandra's mad at you too. It-it doesn't bother you?
Why? Do you have a report due?
No! Y'know, the fantasy! Meet someone from a strange land, fall in madly love, and spend the rest of your lives together.
I love you, too.
Oh that's too bad. It's true, but too bad.
Okay, so from now on we have to call you Princess Consuela?
No!! Why didn't you make a copy and-and keep it in a fireproof box and keep it at least a hundred yards from the original?!!
I know!
Oh my God, me too! Oh! Oh, we'd be like friends-in-law! Y'know what the best part is? The best part is that you already know everything about him! I mean, it's like starting on the fifteenth date!
What's this?
Why don't you just take it with you?
Sorry. So how's it going with Joey?
Okay!
That's mine!! Now, would you both please start acting like adults? And get me my cough drops!
Ok, alright, you guys, you'd better sit down, this is pretty big.
So Don, what-what other restaurants do you like?
Oh God! Orange juice just came out of my nose, but it was totally worth it. Oh my God, I completely forgot about your sound.
So we do Supergirl.
OK, um. Goodbye.
Hi!
: do you know how many times I've seen him jump up like that, believe me I know what he was doing.
Oh, okay. Alright, it's flight 421. Leaves at 8:40.
Since we've been going out, I think I've mentioned his name twice!
Well, y'know I-I-I think I'm gonna respect the privacy of my new secret boyfriend.
All right, I've got a whole bunch of uh-uh, stuff in this area, but umm, I'm getting the feeling that you don't want to deliver.
Oh, Rachel, sweetie, look, here's a really cute picture of Joey and you at the reception.
Bite me.
Oh! Him.
All right that's it, I give up! Whatever you want you can have it! You wanna sing a song? You wanna do a dance? You want your mom stand at the Alter and scream racial slurs? I don't care!
All right, get your coat, we're going to the hospital.
I know!
All right, I'm gonna go to work. Does anybody have a problem with that?
Mmm, looking good. Ok, cider's mulling, turkey's turking, yams are yamming. What?
: yea well the weird part is... he was getting off to a shark attack show!
Four, please. I'm really nervous. Thank you.
I'm there!
Oh, that's Nana, right there in the middle. 'Me and the gang at Java Joe's'.
What?
I was always Joanne.
Who has her own little desk when Roland's not there.
... that she was the huge guy that mugged you? Yah.
Why don't you just have a seat here? OK... give me the Gummi-bears.
Oh, so you like her too Chandler?
I'm just so glad you got to see the babies.
Unless!
Fair enough, now go get ready!
Yeah, so?
Ross, there he is.
What?
Tea gives Phoebe the trots.
You know how much I love listening to your music, you know, but...
Aren't you afraid that Joey's going to figure all of this out? I heard it.
Well, my breasts are going to get bigger weather you like it or not! And you know what? It's not just my breasts. My ass is going to get bigger too.
Dr. Greene. Oh my God it's Rachel's dad. What're you doing here?
What?
Because I need the money, and I thought that it'd be a great way to get rid of that last little schmidgen of self-respect.
Really!
No no, the father can, but um, since I am the roommate I can tell you that she's not here and I'll pass along the message, ok. So bye-bye.
Yo- hooo!
Uh, yeah.
Well maybe I'm ready now. I mean, it's a little scary, but maybe it's right.
Oh! Why didn't you tell me? I made him his own individual sweet potato stuffed pumpkin.
Okay, if it means that much to you...
I have no idea what you just said.
Hey, check me out, I'm a slut!
Dad, it is not. What's with the red light?
Um, Pennsylvania Dutch.
No, just a Friday night.
Oh, is everything in the car?
Oh, yeah, right.
Son of a gun, it is!
Yes.
Thank you?
Can we have our drinks please?! Waiter-Uh, tress!
You can not play bagpipes at the wedding!!
Rachel, things can get incredibly complicated.
Oh, Joey, please tell me you're only donating your time.
How's it going with her?
Hi, who's this? Hi, Joanne. Is Rachel working? It's Monica. Yes, I know I did a horrible thing. Joanne, it's not as simple as all that, ok? No, I don't care what Steve thinks. Hi, Steve.
Hi Frank.
What?
Fine, so you don't like them. Everybody else does.
And it has to go perfectly, because if she doesn't like something about us she can keep us off every adoption list in the state.
Okay, Chandler, you go first.
So Phoebe, why are there men's shoes by the door.
No, you said the baby creeps you out.
Look honey, you don't have to do this, okay? It's the strength you have inside that means the most to me. You're loyal, you're honest, and you have integrity! That's the kind of strength that I want in the man that I love!
You'd better run!
Oh yeah, I got soap and sponges and rags and Carnuba wax and polishing compound.
How many kids were we gonna have?
That's okay.
Yeah! That's why I'm sleeping with him on the side.
Hi!
Oh my God, oh my God. Call me on the phone!
All right, let me see. Will Chandler have sex tonight? Don't count on it. Seems like it works to me.
The oven is on.
It wasn't funny at all! Why would you do that? Why didn't you pick me?
Would you ever be a surrogate for anyone?
What?
Uh, Aunt Iris? This is Phoebe, and that's Rachel...
I don't know, my hand feels weird. I guess it's because, I'm engaged! How long before it starts getting annoying?
It's my TV.
okay, Pheebs, theyre gone.
That was unbelievable!
I kind of have to don't I? Because of this stupid thing.
I still don't get why Greg and Jenny would give us a fake number.
Electrical plans for the building.
Really?
It just makes more sense as an ensemble.
Oh, I-I don't know.
All right! Let's go! Let's go Team Monica! All right, we can work out the name later.
Alright, I'll tell you what. I'll come get you in 5 minutes with some sort of um, kabob emergency.
Sometimes we were.
Wait! Wait! Wait! You can't start today! Today's the rehearsal dinner!
Oh my God, ice just got in my eye!
yep, that's me, I am that stupid .
Ow. Ow. Ow.
No! But because he thought I was to faaaaa.... And every time I think about it, it makes me feel as bad as I did in fifth grade! Y'know, I-I really think that you should apologize to Julie.
I know!!
Really?!
And his puppet too.
Maurice.
Go! Go! Go!
Hi.
Fantastic! I have one question: How is that possible?
All right, look I'm just gonna unplug it.
Ohh. And I don't even have a date.
That's right. I'm no longer a bride. I'll never be a bride again. Now, I'm just someone's wife!
Oh my God!
I hate this game!
Can you go any faster with that?
What don't you just calm down Phoebe! All right?! Why don't you just get all your facts before you run around telling everybody that you're the only hot couple!!
Chandler! Chandler! I just figured out who you are!
What?! You're crazy! There's nothing sexual about the noises I make!
Now, these are-are more realistic, but perishable.
Oh. Monica! ...Hi. I'm Mo- ...nana.
What? I-I said you had a-
Yes.
But my apartment!
She's asleep.
But I didn't.
No. If you thought this mess is going to bother me, you are wrong! All right, let's go Blinky! Chandler!!!!
Make a wish?
Well, you're not.
Oh. You're not gettin' it.
You got the job?! Why didn't you tell me?
Hello? It's Joey. I'm so glad you called! Chandler told me what happened. Y'know he's really upset about it.
Here's your tea Phoebe.
Oh look, and he did my crossword puzzle.
Why? Because everything is my responsibility? Isn't it enough that I'm making Thanksgiving dinner for everyone? You know, everyone wants a different kind of potatoes, so I'm making different kinds of potatoes. Does anybody care what kind of potatoes I want? Nooooo, no, no! Just as long as Phoebe gets her peas and onions, and Mario gets his tots, and it's my first Thanksgiving, and it's all burned, and, and I... I...
All right, what about the third guy?
Well so?
You didn't!
Rachel! What is your cat doing in one of my bowls!
I'm gonna go across the hall to check on the yams.
Have you ever been to one of my weddings?
Hi Honey! We're all here; we just want to wish you a Merry Christmas.
Yeah, we'll be okay.
Oh no, she's still at work, but she told me to tell you to call her.
So, you think you'll do it on his couch?
I am!!
So this is it, we're really gonna adopt?
Y'know, just be there for her.
Wait a minute! Now I'm betting against all three of you?
When, when did-how, how did you...
Quit flicking
Why?
How did you get in there?!
You're right. Maybe I shouldn't go.
Sorry.
Amen.
Please. Half the guys out there have makeup on.
No I don't.
So sexy. Honey.
Oh!
Okay, fine but please don't be upset! Okay? I was really depressed okay? And really drunk! I just wanted something stupid and meaningless. I just wanted...just sex. So, when I...went to your room that night...I was actually looking...for Joey.
Will you stop!
So, do you want me to watch Ben for you?
Oh, my God.
Bye.
Two.
Look Julio, someone left their book here.
Why don't you just weigh out the good stuff about the relationship against the bad stuff. I mean that's what I did when I first weighing stuff.
Joey?! Oh my God, Rachel!
Hey.
No, no, I don't.
A small puff of air, now come on!
Chandler, relax it's not a contest. Certainly not a close one.
Yeah, I knew.
But it didn't. Say hello to Mrs. Chatracus.
It was a project for one of the Home Ec classes.
I hope she's OK.
Stop with the broom, we're not making noise.
Believe me, that is not why we won't be doing that!
Are you crazy?!
Alright, I'll be right back.
Phoebe, I thought you said you know what you're doing?
Why?!
Here you go. You can wear this.
Well, maybe the mailman liked the cookies, we just didn't give him enough.
Yes, you're having a boy!
Bonjour, monsieur.
Okay, here's your milk. What do you want to talk about?
I'm afraid so.
I can't believe this! This is like the worst night ever!
Oh yeah, the Evander Holyfield phase. Oh man you were so hard up you practically came on to me.
Uh-huh, yeah.
OH! Oh, oh!
So, how'd it go?
I'm telling you, something's wrong! My brother does not stay out all night.
And Phoebe is his friend, so he thinks that would be breaking the rules!
What are you talking about? We're all together right now.
And I have costumes.
Hello, Mr. Heckles.
Give me that.
But that's clearly a joke. This could easily be true.
That's how old you are.
Oh God!
What?!
'....Won't you, won't you, won't you.... '
Sorry Joey
-leg?
So you gave in and decided to call someone?
Ohmygod! Rat baby! Rat baby! Rat baby!
Okay, if Joey does the ceremony, then we have to find someone else to walk Phoebe down the isle.
Yeah.
: maybe I will go yea will have a second honeymoon at the Tulsa romana.
Nooo!
Hey!
Ross!!
He is the man in the black dress.
What? When was this?
Yeah, well, I'm using noise. Okay. All right! So, is everybody ready? Here we go. I hear something! I hear something! Where is it?
Okay, Joey's gonna catch it, and you and I are gonna block.
Breathe, breathe, breathe... Good.
You're... weird!
And you know what? We want a rematch.
OK, here you go. Good luck.
Wow. Y'know it is so weird. I mean, you're gonna tell this guy today and he has no idea what's gonna happen.
Come here. I can breath through my mouth.
Really?!
You are so cute! How did you get to be so cute?
Well, you're-you're sweating.
Ugh, I knew giving you that book was gonna come back and bite me in the ass!
And she wants to go hunting, too!!
I'll get back to my new job.
Really? Wow, well then come on, I wanna show you how to fold the toilet paper into a point.
Well, what made you make the exception for me?
Please, just do it!
Hey guys this stuff is just so way in the past. You-you've been through so much since then. And right now you've got so much more important stuff going on in your life. Can't you just let this go?
That is a wonder. So tell me something, Mom. If you had to do it all over again, I mean, if she was here right now, would you tell her?
Yeah. Rach, are you thinking you're gonna make it to Vail?
That's right! You lose sucker!! Please still marry me.
Then I've gotta go. Bye.
Okay. Could the waiters gather around to hear tonight's specials? Okay, first there is a Chilean Sea Bass prepared with a Mango relish on a bag-Why is nobody writing these down?
No I didn't!
Yes! We found you a really cute and funny guy from Chandler's work!
Wait a minute. I thought last night was great.
So! I'm just an empty vase, huh?
Does it have to do with Joey?
Oh good, I'm glad that's catching on.
Oh.
I thought she just had one.
Hi Pheebs, what's up?
Well you can't! We're booked solid for the next month!
Ross!
Okay, does it involve something to do with Pete's computer company?
Y'know what, I'm gonna hold her head.
Let's do it!
Rach, you know that birthing tape you wanted to see? It's here.
Oh, crap!
Chandler, you don't believe in soul mates?
Hey, waitwait, aren't you the guy that plays the butt in the new Al Pacino movie?
Are you serious?
Joey.
What's Phase Two?
So you're gonna be gone four days a week? No.
No! No, no... wait! We didn't lose. The rules clearly stated that the last one to cross the finish line was the loser. Well, our dog never crossed the finish line, so technically...
I LOVE MY NEW JOB!
That's the couch.
Joey, you had the night!
Hey!
Oh, well, I bought Chandler a five hundred dollar watch and he wrote me a rap song.
I can't believe this is taking so long. How are you doing?
Ohh.
Hey. So um, I was thinking that maybe we should start dividing up our stuff.
You are! Hey, here's twenty bucks. -- Why don't you go buy yourself something pretty while I'm at work tomorrow?
And he's a great brother!
Well, umm, Walker was looking for this big bus load of kids.... All right, I get your point.
Okay, so, uh, we're in France, we're making the toast. Do you see a little bassinet in the corner?
You know the words! You are so into this!
Oh good, Lenny and Squigy are here.
Don't worry about it Phoebe, we'll absolutely do it.
What's this?
Fifteen minutes.
You say 'Thank you very much,' and then you buy me something pretty. Come on, we're gonna put are hands in this bowl, and we're gonna start squishing the tomatoes.
Ah!
What?! Are you kidding me?! You-you-you think we're ready to have a baby now?!
She's this girl who used to live in the building before you did. Then she moved to England and she picked up this fake British accent. On the machine this is her message. "Monica, darling! It's Amanda calling!"
Oh, I already have one.
Really? Your work laugh?
Not the way they're doing it. What, what happened? How did she die?
What? I-I bought groceries, I was gonna make you dinner!
You don't think that umm, "The chef's Mahi Mahi was awful awful," is bad press?
Honey, I'm sorry.
What?
Phoebe!
Really?
Please, don't listen to Joey, okay. Would you look at him? He-he's obviously depressed. He's away from his family; he's spending Thanksgiving with strangers. What he needs right now is for you to be his friend.
Went down to the docks. Bet ya didn't know you could get it wholesale.
Ooh, these tennis shoes are so tight. I think I'll take them off.
Scary pigeon's back?
Hi. I'll be ready in just a second.
I can't be fair. You're my boyfriend.
No! You don't know the system! There'll be nobody messing with the system!
Okay, just to be clear comedy with the plates will not be well recieved. Ross makes some sort of sound to let us know it hurt.
I know!!!
Joey, speed it up!
Isn't that sad? I mean, can you see how pathetic that is? You shouldn't be jealous. You should feel bad for him.
Really?
I'm his sister, okay? I love him! I don't want to see him get hurt! Come on! Doesn't that give me the right to control him-help him?
It is so weird, I know what I said, but uh, this morning, I was lying in bed I was, I was imagining what it would be like to say yes. I know it's a little sudden, and it's a little rushed, and it's totally not like me to do something like this, but that doesn't mean I can't. Right? I mean I'm-I'm crazy about Pete, and I know that we want the same things, and when I thought about saying yes, it made me really happy.
What? Why?
You read comic books right?
I promise. Hey, speaking of together, how about we send out a holiday card this year?
Oh my god, honey, I'm so so so so so sorry.
Y'know when girls sleep with guys with weird things on their body, they tell their friends about it.
Is it okay for me to come in now?
Chandler, why would you do that?
Come on! Come on, it'll be fun! It'll make me feel so much better.
Bring it.
For the sixteenth time, no... I do not think you're obsessive.
Yeah, you were, but you decided to make salmon because you had some left over at the restaurant. And then you realised if you bitched about it, then you would stop cooking, and you would have to make your famous baked potato and Diet Coke.
Really.
Yeah, I asked you and Phoebe to pick up the pies. You did remember, right?
Oh no no no no!
Ross, when's this comet thing start?
This is all of your things.
As much as they love you?
I thought I was making headway, everyone was smiling at me all day, I get off work and I find out that they wrote this on my chef's hat.
Well at least, I'm going to mute it.
Chip, is Chip Matthews.
Oh my God!
I wa-
Score! Now can we go?
C'mon Chandler, I think we have been given an opportunity. I mean, the mistake has already been made. They are writing up the paper right now.
Two thousand dollars?
I can't walk. Okay? Okay? These boots were a huge mistake!
Charity?
Everyone at our school heard it!
Okay Ben, why don't you come open some more presents, and Santa, the Armadillo, and I have a little talk in the kitchen? There's a sentence, I never thought I'd say.
I love you. Oh, wait, wait, wait! No hugs. The dresses... Oh what the hell.
Phoebe, we are so proud of you! You're amazing!
Was it...
Mm-hmm.
What are you talking about? What wedding?
Oh. I'm sorry it didn't work out.
Hi.
No.
Oh my God. Richard? Hi!
Oh, please, stop! Look, we're supposed to be honest with each other. I-I just wish you could tell me-just say, "I don't like your massages."
No, only because that's the graduation song.
Hey.
You know, it still smells like monkey in there.
Hey you.
Hi. Uh, you... you don't know me, I'm Monica Geller... Ross's sister.
Yeah.
Come on, hurry!
Hey, isn't weird to think about how next year at this time they'll be a little baby at the table? Rachel's! But good to know where you're at!
Did not.
Well, I know that would make Joey happy, so, I would like that too.
What?!
Okay fine! I keep betting Phoebe that you're gonna have the baby and I don't want to lose again!
So, what's your name?
Oh. I guess you can. Okay but; I-I have to return it, so you can't like it.
Yeah! Okay, this one is a mushroom cap. Umm, this one is made of bologna.
Oops.
You love me!
Fresh cookies! Hot from the oven!
Hey sweetie.
Well, her father pays you for baby-sitting right?
That's very funny!
Chandler! Phoebe's hogging the game!
Hey Joey! Aww, you remembered even though you're a big star!
Oh, that's great!!
Um, yeah, so uh, uhh, listen, I'm sorry I didn't tell you this before but umm, I, I'm no longer at my job, I, I had to leave it.
I don't care. Oh my god. I've lost the will to scold.
No.
We have got to wash that!
Congratulations!
Phoebe, it's okay. You don't have to tip toe around me. I-I've been thinking about it and umm, y'know what? I'm okay about not having that new relationship feeling...
Oh it's so cute. I wonder what age it is when you stop being able to put both legs over your head.
You go back out there and you seduce her till she cracks!
Oh yeah, picked a guy, 37135.
Joey, what are you doing? You promised Phoebe you wouldn't eat meat until she has the babies!
What is the worse part?
Oh my God, I wrecked your baby!!
That's right.
Now Joey, you go down there and you suck up to him. I mean you suck like you've never sucked before!
Oh, I'm sorry. Of course I mean that. Interesting idea, umm, talk about it, but no.
Y'know all my friends think this is weird.
Hello? Hold on please. Joey, it's your mom.
Congratulations!/Good for you!/Great!
I'm sorry that I made you stop seeing him.
Hey, Danny!
No, please don't. Please, Joey. She will kill us!
Hey.
What?!
Oh, just so you know, you-you have to let him win.
They're my pants!
Hey, look at me. I'm making jam, been at it since 4 o'clock this morning.
Oh, Nancy Thompson from Phoebe's old massage place is getting fired.
Yeah. Go over to Joey's. Go over to Joey's and drink some beer and hammer up some drywall.
Okay. It's zero hour. All teams execute on my count. Let's get this bad boy on the road.
So this is what a stroke feels like.
Really?
Why? It's just that I've waited seven years for an opportunity like this, and you can't even wait four and a half minutes for a stupid onion tartlet?
Ross! That is so sweet of you to get Phoebe that bike! When I heard the story, I almost cried.
Now I'm guessing that he bought her the big pipe organ, and she's really not happy about it.
That's not really how it works.
Isn't that great?
I know! Phoebe is gonna love dressing them in these!
So, did I hear Poconos?
What happened to Janine?
Thank you, Pheebs!
Why?
Yeah, you're my husband. I'm not gonna live in a different state than you for 208 days out of the year.
No! No. They're umm... They're just uh...ground beef smileys.
That's right baby! Okay, what do I want now?
Hey Rach, maybe your resolution should be to umm, gossip less.
No. But I remember people telling me about it.
They won't be ready for weeks.
Give me the good stuff.
Ok, hypothetically, why won't I be married when I'm 40?
Brrrrrrr!
And they weren't looking at you before?!
We're sorry honey.
Son of a bitch!
I can't believe I did this. I can't believe I'm singing for the people, and they liked me! Hey, did you hear thatone shouting "look at those tips"! I mean, did I really help you get a lot of tips?
OK, how does everybody like their burgers?
Well uh, you and I are just goofing around, I thought, why not goof around with him.
Perhaps, you would like me to turn like this, so that you can bunny bump against my back.
I don't believe this! Wow, look at this refrigerator! It's gigantic! I mean I could live in this thing! I'd be cold, but I'm always cold. Oh my God, look at these spider burners! I love spider burners.
Listen, I'm sure that dad doesn't care. He probably thought this was funny; he'll be telling this story for years!
No you don't.
Pheebs, how's it going?
Ready?
What?
Oh my God, can you believe we are surrounded by all this? I can barely control myself.
No, no, no, I don't make chocolate pies. When I was younger I-I enter in this pie-eating contest. I ate so many that just the thought of them made me sick.
I know.
The only problem!
Abso... ...lutely. See, I love creating new recipes. I love Thanksgiving. And, well, now, I love Mockolate.
Do you want some shortbread? Eh that's Scottish like you are.
Really?! How much?!
What?
Okay, have you considered using a girl with huge knockers?
It's Joey!
Yeah.
Are you serious?!
Yeah, I think you should keep looking!
Are you awake?
Bye.
Check it out!
Okay, I'll see you tomorrow! Just so you know, we're not seeing him tomorrow. I-I cannot spend another evening with that man. Do you remember how he behaved at our wedding?
Nothing, just never seen you in little stretchy pants before.
And he came at us with an axe, so Rachel had to use a bug bomb on him!
Then what is it?
What?
Okay, Phoebe, y'know what? That-that's it, that's it, all right? No dinosaurs, no ghosts, no giant dogs, okay? They're not the right size, they're not Victorian, and they just don't go.
Wow!
Yeah, I saw him waiting for an elevator.
No that's, that's okay.
I'm the hostess! Not those guys! I'm always the hostess! I mean, I was always the hostess, I mean even when I was little, I mean the girls brought their dollies to my tea party, I-I served the best air.
You have to!
Okay.
So Ross, are you gonna bring Mona?
What are you, animals? It's 4 o'clock in the afternoon!
Mrs. Bing? Here, these are my parents umm, Judy and Jack Geller.
That's stealing!
That's right. That's right. And that is why you can't stay here tonight. And probably why you shouldn't come to the wedding.
What can we do for you?
Okay.
Myself. Y'know for remembering to pack a thing. Yeah, you do a good thing, you get a check! My mom does it, I never realised it was weird.
Oh, Phoebe, she couldn't stop crying! With those thick glasses, her tears looked giant.
Oh, my goodness, they've all gotten so big!
We ripped that couple apart, and kept the pieces for ourselves.
Okay, come here!
Well then get it, get it!
I don't know what else to say.
What about the closeness?
Oh, I wish I didn't have to wait to take a pregnancy test.
Phoebe, I did not have sex.
You'll be fine. Nah, you won't, but I'll be back in two minutes.
Well, he told me he was going out with the guys, I just didn't know that you were the guys.
Oh really, so that hysterical phone call I got from a woman at sobbing 3:00 A.M., "I'll never have grandchildren, I'll never have grandchildren." was what? A wrong number?
Thank you. Just make yourself comfortable.
Here you go! What do you think about centerpieces?
Yeah!
Well y'know Joey, you're a pretty charming guy.
I made you a surprise.
Maybe.
Hexadrin.
I personally would be honored if she wanted to live with me.
Why don't I just take off my clothes and have a nightmare.
Ross, I hated you when we were kids.
Yeah, once again, I am sorry. Thank you. Bye. I just had to turn down a job catering a funeral for sixty people.
Listen umm, I've been thinking, it's not fair for me to ask you to spend all of your money on our wedding. I mean, you work, you work really hard for that.
I want you to meet someone really special. Phoebe, this is Erica. And this is the baby!
Fine,
Chandler! You're home!
That's just good sense!
Hey there.
Joey is gonna be a celebrity guest on a game show!
It's easy! Just keep it casual! Give him a kind word, shake his hand and give him the money!
What?!
A quin pidio el pollo General Tso?
Please, just a little bit off the back.
No, not if their room has two beds!
I know.
Nah, I got it.
Oh, about five minutes. Right now they're interviewing his opponent. Apparently he trains by going to Iran and pulling the arms off thieves.
Oh my God! She's amazing. Oh, oh I'm so glad you guys got drunk and had sex!
This is my favorite part.
Ok, um so, I still have to invite Dillon and Emma and Shannon Cooper.
Great!! That's great!
OK, look. That is Aunt Iris. This woman has been playing poker since she was five. You gotta listen to every word she says. Hi!
Eh... Heart Disease, Alzheimers, gout?
Our kids are gonna call her Aunt Janice aren't they?
I know!
Hi. We checked the third and fourth floor, no-one's seen Marcel.
What for?
It's harder for me! I have those four other women to compete with!
I highly doubt that.
OK, we got the cole slaw, we got the buns...
DON'T...be too long with the phone.
I mean think about all the money that you're gonna make!
Take care.
Wait. He pooped in my shoe? Which one?
So. Welcome. Is this your first time you're seeing Emma?
Yeah.
Sure! Alright...
Maybe Joey doesn't have to give you the money, TV stars have assistants right?
Did the girl ever let you ride it?
This baby has got everything. Take y'know, locations for instance. First, organized alphabetically, then geographically, then by square footage.
Yeah, I've had them picked out since I was fourteen.
And who laminated it?
You're the best friend I ever had.
Oh yeah? Ok, let's settle this, come on!
There's something that we wanna tell you. We decided to name the girl-baby Erica.
Oh no-no-no, stay, stay, stay, just keep talking. I'm always the hostess.
Oh my God, I went to high school with her. Rachel! Hi!
Well Ross, you be careful now. You don't want to get a reputation as y'know Professor McNailshisstudents.
They gave us a fake number? Why? Why would they do that?
I...
Well, we just happen to go to alot of places where you might drink. I mean, how do you go to a wine tasting without having a drink? Or... or to a club, or to the... zoo.
I just don't think arcade games go in the beautiful guest room. The beautiful guest room is gonna be filled with antiques.
I have nothing to say to you.
Hi!
You really think that'll work?
You wanted it to be a surprise.
Close? She's got her tongue in his ear.
Yes, a relationship. For your information I am crazy about this man.
Are you gonna be ok, officer, uhm,...
Pass the cheese, please.
Huh!
How who wears it?
Oh my God, it was incredible.
Is there any chance that you can look at this as flattering? I mean, she's doing it because she wants to be more like you.
Oh, isn't he? Oh, you know, I really think this time it may work with him. I mean, he just makes me feel so good and I've been feeling so lousy this last couple of months, no job, no boyfriend. Well, at least my cup is half full.
Oh that's so sweet.
Sweetie, you know I have no sense of humor when it comes to the wedding.
You broke a little girl's leg?!!
Okay. So you, me and London. Looking at people differently. Maybe he wants to do what you and I did in London with someone.
We sure are.
You didn't even take off your pants.
Megan!
Yes it's true.
Hmm, bite me.
I hope you cleaned your hair out of the drain.
Kinda like your Barca lounger.
All right then, your bra would still be big.
I gave you one job!
Would you stop?
Okay! It's time for dinner. Everyone we're using our fancy china.. um and its very expensive so please be careful.
I hear ya. Excuse me for just a second!
I'm sorry.
Honey, you're not pathetic, you're sad.
Oh God, maybe he won't see us. Richard!
Um, okay, here it goes. I'm not 22. I'm, I'm 25... and thirteen months.
Could've played Monopoly, but nooooo.
That really means a lot. Oh, and Mom, don't bite your nails.
Hey Chandler! Did you like the macaroni and cheese?
Phoebe, I can explain!
He asked you out?!
YES!
Now are drawers will smell nice and we didn't waste these pantyhose.
Hmm, well you're around me all the time and you don't flirt.
Ross! He's playing with my spatulas again!
Okay! Oh God, y'know what? It's really bad.
Oh, what about that guy over there? Remember? That is the guy you flirted with at the counter that time.
No!
You know everything!! Oh wait, double or nothing. I bet you the baby is over seven pounds. I bet you it has hair. I bet you it's a girl.
Yeah, she hates all mass produced stuff. She thinks her furniture should have a history, a story behind it.
Hey!
Hmm?
Sure.
Yeah, apparently they're turning it into some kinda coffee place.
Yeah. I mean it was kinda fun for a while, but didn't you start feeling silly?
I know.
I think he's shy.
What is it with you people! I mean, the minute you start to feel something, you have to run away?
Okay, what's going on with you?
God, I'm sorry! I'll go back and get it!
Hey, Rach, can you give me a hand with this box?
Okay! The movers will be here in 11 hours. Rachel has not packed. Now, everybody has to help! Chandler, we're gonna start with...
No, Rachel never pees in public restrooms.
What?!
Sure?
Really?!
Really?
Joey, what's going on?
You don't tell me what to do! I tell you what to do! Just call her. She's at the Paradise Hotel in Barbados. And while I've got you, you've got curly hair. What do you do in humidity? Damnit!
Wait a minute! Unless, we give her all gifts she can use after she's done being pregnant. Like-like umm, regular coffee, Tequila.
Very good! What do you need it for anyway?
Hell, I wanna see Joey.
Come on! Tests make us all better learners! Oh yeah! We should have essay questions!!
Ok, thank you. Uh, well this is it. Are you OK?
I'm gonna go tell Joey that that you're back. I was really worried about you.
: Here why don't you sit down, get yourself comfortable because I. have a little surprise for you.
No, you were right. I don't have a plan.
Y'know what we should do? We should all get dressed up and go to have champagne at The Plaza.
...horribly attractive. I'll be shutting up now.
He's retiling my floor.
Alright, I tell you what, I'll give this to you now if you can tell me where we keep the dustpan.
And ice!
Don't worry Joe, I won't come next year! Joey: What have you got there?
Ahhhhhhhh!
Ross you know that tonight is your date with Hillary?
I mean really, think about it.
It's beautiful! It's like the first bathroom floor there ever was. Whoa! Are you going in there for?
Then you two can, can sneak into the cockpit, and things will start to heat up, and then a stewardess comes in... I've been watching too much porn.
You would not. I can't believe this. I hate this, you're too normal. I can't believe my boyfriend doesn't have a thing. My boyfriend doesn't have a thing.
Now there you go! I wouldn't want my best guest to strain her eyes!
That was a terrible throw!!
Oh my God, this is great! This is so great! . Did you hear that?
What are you talking about?
Chicken? I could eat some chicken.
Rachel umm, I was just talking to this guy and I think he'll have sex with you.
No, but that's probably 'cause I haven't asked them yet.
Wait a minute, who told you? You are dead meat.
All right, I definitely taste nutmeg.
You need one too?
Oh..please!I-I welcome criticism. 3rd Customer: The musician right outside the restaurant...it's kind of a mood-killer!
Then why are you laughing?
Okay!
I mean I-I thought you were nuts at first, but you-you did it. And now you can just look back at this thing with no regrets.
You guys are always hanging out in my apartment! Come on, I'll only use my left hand, huh? Come on, wussies! All right, ok, I gotta go. I'm going, and I'm gone.
Yes. Yes, I was. A guy. From work. I'm seeing a guy from work! Ha!
You're right, I'm sorry. It's not like you're y'know, going out with an ex-girlfriend.
What did you do to his sweater vests?
Had it.
So what? Don't you have any will power?
Bing's weird.
Well, it just seems like a really small number.
Ow! Ow! Ow!
Man, I feel like I'm coming down with something.
Ok, you have to stop playing now.
You remember that video I found of mom and dad?
Hi Phoebe.
Phoebe, he's a friend of my parents. He's like 20 years older than me.
What does she mean by 'involved'?
Oh my God! I love him!
Phoebe!
I thought that was a good thing.
I'm guessing your new girlfriend wouldn't urinate on my coffee table.
I'll be right back.
Well, the giraffe's okay. And so is the pirate.
Hey. Call me when you get there. Okay?
If someone wants to give us a present, we don't want to deprive them of that joy.
Uh, wait, backstage?
Hi. We're buying the house next door, and we were wondering if we could just take a look around.
Yeah that's right.
Really? My God, he's really cute.
OK, I'll go. OK, senior year of college... on a pool table.
Yeah, he's just gotta get a shot.
I just can't stand you being here all the time.
Waaay too special.
Joey, I left my watch on the counter last night. It was right here, where is it?
Pete.
Okay.
One.
Awww. But still no.
I guess they're back from their date.
What about me?
One hour? You are such a leaf blower.
Where's your bed?
No-no-no! We need something old!
Please! I made this game what it is.
I know that there's no hole there, I just really liked that picture.
It's so weird, how did Joey end up kissing Charlie last night? I thought you'd end up kissing Charlie.
It's kind of a package deal!
Phoebe, it's not about quantity.
Guys, rules are good! Rules help control the fun! Ohhh!
Look, guys, you can't do this, it's just going to make getting over each other, that much harder.
Oh, good.
No, a guy would be saying, "I'm never gonna get to sleep with anyone else." Oh my God! I'm never gonna get to sleep with anyone else! I've been so busy planning the wedding that I forgot about all the things that I'd be giving up! I mean, I...I'm never gonna have a first kiss again.
Oh, I'm- I'm so sorry!
Oh well, it's not so bad.
...What did I ask?
Ooh, are we allowed to lie in the vows?!
Well, I want he baby to come out all cute and fat!
You're so efficient. I love you!
All right okay, just so you know, I'm not gonna make a turkey this year.
Yeah. Hey, that was nice of you guys to back off and let Joey get the girl for once.
No!! You have been screwing us all day!
Yeah but I was just screwing with you to try to get your voice all high and weird like mine is now!
Yes, you are so smart!
Is that some kind of boat talk?
We are! Help us!
Hey, don't say that! You got just as good a chance as anybody else of getting that job!
Chandler... In all my life... I never thought I would be so lucky. As to...fall in love with my best...my best... There's a reason why girls don't do this!
Shhh!
Wh-what, why?
I'm Monica.
Oh...Rach!
Wow, all you need now is The Killing Fields and some guacamole and you've got yourself a part-ay.
Hello? Chandler, what's wrong? Oh my God, are you alright? Yeah, I'll be right there. I'm so sorry, but Chandler was in a car accident.
Ok.
No you don't!
No I didn't, I said kiwi lime. That's what makes it so special.
Oh boy me too!
And this goes for all guys?
Oh! Did anybody see that-that documentary on the Korean War?
A salad? Really I, I could do something a little more complicated if you like.
Well umm, they both have a egg yolk and butter base, but a bearnaise has shallots, shirvel, and most importantly tarragon.
Me too.
'I am Bea.'
Wait a minute, they're making you take time off work?
I'd like to have Don and Phoebe over. Wouldn't that be nice?
It is not over! You're over!
Ross they're really, really, really white.
It's not mayonnaise!!
You have got to get over this. You're not gonna end up alone.
What are you doing?!
All right then, go fight for her! Go to London! I mean, that could be you and Emily! That, but-but nicer. Just, go to London!
Alright.
Well, I think I shouldn't look directly at them.
I don't know.
All right. But umm, I-I-I'll pay you back all the money you invested, and you can keep the van.
I know honey, I'm sorry.
We're really glad you decided to meet our guy.
Oh my God! Are-are you crying?
Ok, that's enough.
Okay everybody, let's go! Let's go!
Umm, okay. If it's a boy it's Daniel.
Hello?
What are you gonna do?
Oh my God! Ross, you wouldn't believe the cute little noises the twins are making. Listen.
Okay, let's go!! Let's hit the road!!
Well, uh y'know, our guy works with Chandler and he's really nice and smart and he's a great dresser!
That is so sweet!
Oh, it's so beautiful. Ohh! Y'know, I-I don't know if I feel right about this.
Make it fifty!
Wow, is that Michelle?
Done?
I'm fine.
Am I on fire today or what?! Those birds are browned, basted, and ready to be carved!
We didn't get anything for anyone.
They'r alright.
Hi!
You guys are dead, I am so good at lighting rounds.
Yeah.
No! Rachel is meeting us here.
Oh, thank you.
Okay.
Oh...
Ok. Hold on. Geller here! No! I said it has to be there by 4 o'clock. Goodbye. Oh, how hard it is to make an ice sculpture?
I'm parked in a garage on Morton!
Ow!! Ow!!
Can you hear me say "You're grounded"?
Uh, no. Loosely translated 'We should do this again' means 'You will never see me naked'.
It's okay, 'cause y'know what? You don't really need me for the business.
The head tilt?
You're so efficient. I love you!
You were just being so nice to him!
...They threw us out! I was thrown out of a hotel! Me!
I can't wait to be with you! I'll just tell Rachel I'm gonna be doing laundry for a couple of hours.
Oh yeah! What was his superpower again?
That's much better.
Well... That's not the only time this was an issue. You remember when umm, you spent Thanksgiving with us? You called me fat.
I don't know what to say. We shouldn't have lied to you.
I don't know!
Oh really? Okay, let's compare, shall we.
One-Mississippi. Two-Mississippi. Three-Mississippi.
Okay, well, we have to get past this! Why don't we get rid of the tape and pretend it never existed?
Come on!
How about a Youhoo with a funny straw?
Whoa!
Oh.
Ewww!
These aren't for you! Are you upset?
You know that's nice, y'know we could put it back there after the surgeons remove it from your colon!
Rachel, you are packed though right, I mean please tell me that you're packed.
oh God.
Hey! Do you think that we can get to the subway right there if we climb down through the manhole cover?
Oh, that is amazing!
We're gonna pick up the wedding dress then we're gonna have lunch with mom.
Yeah. That-that was the problem.
You know it's funny, the last time Paulo was here, my hair was so much shorter and cuter.
Okay!
Okay, Rachel, you wanna put the marshmellows in concentric circles.
All right, eight we get married, but 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12 we don't get married.
Okay, okay, I'm sure that Rachel came home early and picked up Emma. You go look across the hall, and I'll call her cell.
We're supposed to meet my parents in 15 minutes.
Oh my God! Let me see.
How do you do that?
Oh, right.
Mail call, Rachel Green, bunk seven.
Uh huh.
Hey wait a minute, this one isn't dirty.
I think she's here.
All right Rach, for what it's worth, I think that you're doing great. I mean y'know let's face it, no one handles this well.
See there you go. Woo! We're out of the woods. Okay, I'll get dressed now.
Okay! There's only one left, three letter word, not dog but...
Yeah?
What did I tell you about the hall?!
Oh my God, she's not gonna like the chicken that night either is she?!
This is so wild. Ya know, I gotta admit, I was kinda surprised that you agreed to go on a blind date.
Phoebe! Come on I'm serious! I just got to talk to him about all this.
Okay, d'y'see anybody you think could be me?
I like 'em.
Hmm.
No, my eye doctor is Richard! I can't go to him when I don't have a boyfriend!
There's a pregnant woman in Ohio, and she picked us!
Yeah, I'm good.
Good. What made you change your mind?
Rach, Phoebe hates Pottery Barn.
We were just waxing our legs.
I could do that.
I know, it is isn't it?
There's nothing we can do. You erased the message!
Oh, Janine, the really hot dancer girl?
Really? The scientist guy?
She pulled it out of me! She's like a conversational wizard! How'd it go?
How? I don't have any money.
Leon, Leon. Shhh! Guys. Wait, I don't understand. Those steaks were just a gift from the meat vendor. That was not a kick back. I'll just replace them and we can forget the whole thing. What corporate policy? No. Yeah. All right. I just got fired.
Of course I have! What do you think, I'm some 30 year old virgin?
Oh, George, baby, drop the towel!
Maybe because it's you hung your head out of the window like a dog the whole ride here.
That's because I'm in front of them.
That is sooo not true!
'Kay, here you go.
No Chandler, you don't understand! Okay! Okay! Okay! Fine! Now you know. Okay? I'm y'know...I'm sick.
With good news? Of course it is not good news, you just said "Doctor Connelly just called". If it was good news you would have said "Doctor Connelly just called! " But so what is it? Is there a problem, uh? Is there a problem with me or with you?
Uh-huh!
Come in! Come in! We're engaged!!!
Hey, it is unreasonable to expect a child to wait for a light bulb to cook brownies!
Roger wants to take her out tomorrow night.
*What*??
They've arrested Monica.
Well I-I really don't remember the name of it.
Noo!! Okay!!
What?
I don't understand, I mean am I so hard to live, is this why I don't have a boyfriend?
How she drove you crazy, picking on every little detail, like your hair... for example.
Would you look at them?
No, you are not. We tell you stuff.
Uh-oh, it was bad?
All right then.
Do you realize that four weeks from today we're getting married? Four weeks baby!! Four weeks!!!
Oh my God. You guys! You gotta come see this! There's some creep out there with a telescope!
Oh, I'm sorry, mrs Hannigan.
Yeah, because I hear the king is looking to adopt.
What's tonight?
Hmm, a little relieved, I gotta say.
Mom already called this morning to remind me not to wear my hair up. Did you know my ears are not my best feature?
Hey Pheebs, how's it going?
Okay. Wait, just give me a second, I need to just get my boots off first. Ah...Ooh...Oohh...Ohh...Oh God...Ohh...Oh...Ohh...Ohhhh...
That is not true!
When were we not friends?
You just wanna stay home so you can make a move on Joey!
I missed this apartment! Now, this is a grown-up's apartment! Y'know, I-I should be with a grown-up, do you know what I mean?!
Come on! Come on, if we have sex again it'll double our chances of getting pregnant. Do you think that closet's still available?
Hey, Rach, how was work?
Fine, I can do it. Whew.
Yeah, and we've paid for a room, that we're supposed to be in right now!
Yes, is that okay?
Why would I say anything? That two of our best friends could start the greatest love affair of their lives! And they would have me to thank, and we could all start having babies?
Oh my God.
Oh, I was thinking about having people over for the game.
I missed you-you ugly, flat faced old freak!
Oh-my-god Rachel! Rachel!
It's very interesting, Phoebe.
How 'bout just a boom?
Oh God, you fell off the wagon.
Look at it! Ohhh! Wallpaper's a little faded, that's okay. Carpet's a little loose. Hardwood floors!!
Doesn't matter, I'll get 'em tomorrow. Or not. Whenever.
What uh-What did you-What?!
Hi. Richard just told me he loves me.
Can we just start throwing things in?
Nooooo. You're really not going?
Cowboy boots? I've never worn cowboy boots in my whole life!
So on this road trip, did you guys win any money?
What is she talking about?
Ok, fine!! I bought 20 extra tickets for me and Chandler.
Okay. Ow!!!!! Ow-oh-oh!
We'll just...we'll just let her stay.
And people will think you own a Porsche because you're wearing the clothes?
I can't answer that! Chandler's my husband.
I lost our mattresses.
It's so good, isn't it?
Rachel, the cute doctors are here.
Gary's gonna ask you to move in with him!!
Oh, Chandler, that's sweet. But you don't have to do everything Doctor Phil tells you to do.
What?
Rachel always cries!
Okay. Don't you want a cookie?
And you're cute too.
Okay!
Pretty much. So, what do you, what do you think of the floor?
Me too! Yeah, Chandler can't stand it. He won't even allow me to have blue cheese in the house.
Okay. Let's bring it in.
Oh.
Wh-what are we gonna tell him?
Nice try; I'm keeping the boots.
Ah no, you see, someone was supposed to take them down around New Years... but obviously someone forgot.
Phoebe, he's gotta be in the room for that to work.
I knew you were not okay with that.
Hello! Were we at the same table? It's like... cocktails in Appalachia.
How long has it been this time?
What if he reads it in the paper?
So guys, listen, I go over there, and umm...
Yeah?
Hm-hmm!
Oh my God!
That, you get? That, you get?
Well Phoebe doesn't eat turkey...
What you guys don't understand is, for us, kissing is as important as any part of it.
What?
Well, why would she lie to you?
And I can't stop you.
I don't know how any of these got opened?!
Wow! Wow! And it's definitely all gone? There's nothing there to work with? What were you thinking?
What time?
Oh, and I can also speak a little French. Voulez-vous coucher avec moi ce soir? Why? What did I say?
All right then, then nothing changes! Everything is great! Everything stays the same! And you go unpack because it's been three days and it's driving me insane!
That thing is not coming in here.
Oh my God!
Oh, I'm totally crazy, but you-you like the food?
Why do you do it?
Hi! I'm Monica and I'm gonna be singing "Delta Dawn""Delta Dawn, what's that flower you have on? Could it be a faded rose from days gone by? ..."
Okay, I just don't get why you like it so much.
How did it go with Frank and Alice?
Hey Hon, could you help me get the plates down?
Yeah, well he's my brother! And plus he drives so slow he could never hurt it.
I got it!
Janice, what umm, what are you doing here?
Rachel's really the one who's pregnant.
I mean, was it Gina?
No, she's out shopping.
Rach, does this have nonfat milk?
Emily Waltham.
So? What do you think of the house?
Do I go horseback riding in the park? Do I take classes at the New School?
Would you like something to drink?
No, we don't.
Oh, did you catch him?!
A little tight? I could see double-oh and seven in those pants.
For what?
"Willing to adopt triplets?" No!
Okay.
Okay, this is the den. All right, check this out. Lights! Whoa! All right. Less lights! Bad lights! Lights go away! Oh, see you just need to find the right command.
They hurt so much!
Hey!
Okay.
Well for your information he happens to be one of the brightest, most sophisticated, sexiest men I've ever been with.
Oh no no, this is not for him, this is for me. That way he's still sober but I find his stories about shoelaces much more amusing.
Not really.
Who? I mean have you seen a car come by here in the last hour and a half? I think we should call Ross, maybe he can get a car and come pick us up.
William Sonoma, fall catalog, Page 27.
Yeah, like I don't know, maybe you have a work problem that you need his advice on.
Hey, you just got in 5 minutes ago!
So I, I told Rachel it was just gonna be the two of us.
ooohh... hey! Wanna stick around and I'll whip you up some dinner?
Yes I do!
The ones we had right after you almost threw up.
Hey, at least I knew where my guy was.
Ok, um, I'll go with you.
Did I miss it? Rachel, I-I want you to know that, if it's positive, we're gonna...
Chandler.
Thank you! 2nd Customer: It was. The duck in particular was superb.
Wow! A star! I know you all hate me and-and I'm sorry, but I don't care.
Hey, wait a second. I can help you with this. You just need to be organized. We can make a list of your qualifications, and categorize jobs by industry. There could be folders and files!
Great!
Well yeah, but, you know, uh, 27 is a dangerous eye age.
Oh no-no-no, it's only one night a week, and plus I get to take all of you out for a lot of free dinners.
A new pair of shoes for the Chan-Chan man! Yes!
No, he's not. And if I can't get pregnant with you, then I don't want to get pregnant by... him or anyone else.
Umm, and looking at people differently.
I was frustrated.
There are no jobs. There are no jobs for me.
Yeah, a-a-and clean. Not just health department clean... Monica clean.
What?
Oh my God, Mike was gonna propose?
Ok, so that's what we're doing. You know, when I'm in the coffee house bopping along to one of your songs, I'm wearing ear plugs.
Level 1 alert. I repeat, level 1. This is not a drill. Okay we've got a situation. The minister just called. He's snowed in. He can't make it.
I feel terrible, I really do.
Really?!
Hi, how are you doing Kelly?
I have no idea, but X-rays alone could be a couple hundred dollars.
You don't mind me touching your belly, do you?
Nothing. Nothing.
I promise you, next time I will absolutely tell you.
OK, I'll see you later babe.
Who is that?!
Hey-hey-hey. You wanna hear something that sucks.
Gimme them!
Oh, hey handsome! Oh, I'm gonna love you so much that no woman is ever gonna be good enough for you! Oh, we are so lucky!
Okay, we'll start with the building. You guys take the first and second floor, Phoebe and I'll take third and fourth.
Dad , Mom . Look! Look who it is it's Chandler!
What the hell is that dog doing here?!
Look, if you want you can keep it at our place until you find out what to do with it.
Hi. About last night... I know you are under a lot of stress and even though the things you said hurt me a little bit... My point is, uh, well, I'm willing to take my job back.
Yeah. Run ten blocks, that'll help the smell.
Larry?
Hey-hey.
I would love too, but I can't! I mean I just can't, you know that I'm not good at confrontation.
: Hey Rach its me ok I just got the Chandler's room and I caught him molesting himself.
Hey, guys, guys, did you see my new, china cabinet?!
That is exactly why I do not lend you stuff!! Okay?! I mean, first it's my jewelry! And if it's not my jewelry, it's-it's my blue sweater! And if it's not my sweater, it's my sunglasses!
Phil!
Ross, but me down for another box of the mint treasures, okay. Where, where are the mint treasures?
Okay.
What?!
Yep, we're gonna meet the lady who could be carrying our baby.
You can't say that!! You-you don't know!! I mean I thought I was gonna pass out from the pain! Anyway I-I tried, but I-I couldn't...bend that way. So...
Well I'm not sure yet, but umm of the top of my head I'm thinking double sided tape and some sort of luncheon meat.
He took up the carpet, and now you can hear everything.
Okay.
Not now.
What?
Two guys in one night? Wow, I thought she became a slut after she got her nose fixed.
Hey, Rach! I made a pile of your stuff over on this side of the room. If you could just......throw your purses at it.
Are you funny? Tell us a joke!
What's the matter?
Okay. I'm gonna be the mom that makes the world's best chocolate chip cookies.
Wow, those pills really worked, huh?
Anyway erm, are you going to get a handyman to install this stuff?
So what. So he drank a lot tonight.
It-it's so great to see you both here.
I knew you were likely to take a wife!
Rachel locked the door.
Joey?
Okay.
Yeah I am!
Are you okay?
Okay, I'm never gonna wear them again. I just didn't get a chance to say goodbye.
Olivia? I thought she was marrying Connor! Oh right, real life more important.
Okay.
I'm gonna miss you!
All right, just give it back to me when your done. See you guys.
I am 26.
Wait a minute, you got Ross Gellar and guest?! I wasn't invited and you got "and guest?!"
Oh no, you see we're on our honeymoon. So umm, can you do your little thing and bump us up to first class?
Then, I'd steer clear of Phoebe.
Ok, ten.
I won't know what I would do without you.
Okay, all right, how's this? 27. Italian-American guy. He's an actor, born in Queens. Wow, big family, seven sisters, and he's the only....boy. Oh my God, under personal comments 'New York Knicks, rule!'
Could not be more terrified.
What were you doing in Africa?
Oh, we used to drive each other crazy playing the shadow game.
Y'know what really bothers me? Is-it's how-how different you act around them! I mean y'know the throwing the tennis games, the fake laugh, the "I'll see you around, Bing!" "Not if I see you first, Doug!" I gotta tell you, I don't like Work Chandler. Okay? The guy's a suck-up.
My husband.
Well, because we want to get to know her better and she's never been to New York so she wants to see all the tourists' spots... you know, Statue of Liberty, Empire State Building...
Come on! It wasn't that bad!
And you're not gonna do that.
Yeah, I think I have some around here somewhere. Why?
Oh stop it. Joey already told me.
Oh that's great!
No.
Okay! Why?!
How could I be asleep knowing that you were in the next room.
Does it involve travel?
I'm not sure about this.
Chandler is such an idiot!
Plus, everyone's gonna see your thing.
Hey! What did you decide to do about the movie?
Why not?
Joey, promise me something.
I can't believe you're not gonna be here for Christmas.
Oh, did you do a picture of Emma?
Yeah.
Don't you mean..groomy?
So umm, how was your date with Ginger?
Oh yeah? When?
What?!
I'm sure they'll be here soon.
This isn't even my dress.
No! Umm well, some people say that Oysters are an aphrodisiac.
Y'know what, that's fine, maybe you haven't grown up, but I have.
Wow! It's really red! You should go see my eye doctor.
We were, we were just in the storage area and we saw this really creepy man!
Do you love her?
What are you talking about?
She's bluffing!
My parents will be so happy.
I know, how can you not be accross the hall anymore.
Well...it's just umm...I'm afraid you might mess it up.
I love how it crumbles. Now see, your chocolate doesn't do that.
What are you being such a weenie for? So he has a Barbi, big deal. You used to dress up like a woman.
Emily has probably been planning it since she was five! Ever since the first time she took a pillowcase and hung it off the back of her head. That's what we did! We dreamed about the perfect wedding, and the perfect place, with the perfect four-tiered wedding cake , with the little people on top. Thanks. But the most important part is that we had the perfect guy who understood just how important all that other stuff was.
What?
Oh Rachel, I know the best coffee house and it's sooo close.
What's the matter?
You did!
Bye-bye!
Not Chandler, just Joey.
Y'know which one was she again?
Maybe we could call the phone company. Maybe they could change the message. Maybe they can change his number.
God! Look at all these tickets! It's so exciting! You know I haven't won anything since the sixth grade.
Phoebe did the signs!
I don't care.
First of all um, I love you both so much and you're both so important to me...
Sure.
Oh umm, that's because I just wanted to y'know walk in on me and Chandler while we were, y'know, doing it all night. Will you excuse me for just a second?
In the beginning where y'know it's all sex and talking and sex and talking and...
Joey!! What the hell were you doing?!
I'm so sorry that you had to find out this way. I'm sorry, but it's true, I love him too.
Hey!
So anyway, I'm cooking dinner for him Monday night. You know, kind of like an audition. And Phoebe, he really wants you to be here, which will be great for me because then you can 'ooh' and 'ahh' and make yummy noises.
Matt Guire, Mark Lynn, Ben Wire...
Hah!
Yeah, ah, but Pheebs don't you think he's a little young to get married?
Ross, Rachel promised it would be over by now. We seriously have to go, if we want to get to Vermont. I called them and the last train leaves in a half hour.
you don't have insurance?
Go ahead Rach.
Oh-ho-ho, we've got company.
I swear, I promise. I promise. Oh my God, I'm so excited! {And I just can't hide it! I'm about to lose control and I think I like it! Sorry, just couldn't resist it.} All right, listen let me tell you, do not get her flowers. Okay? Because y'know, she cries when they die, and there's the whole funeral...
It says "Do it!". And behold she did adopt onto them a baby. And it was good.
Well, maybe you could give to somebody else. Ooh, like Ross Geller.
Hey honey! I missed you today!
And y'know what, I just realised, in the last year I've only gone out with two guys, Richard and Julio. You gotta help me out here, you gotta set me up, you gotta get me back in the game.
No! No! I shouldn't have even opened these! I mean I-Joey I am out of control!! Joey, you have to do me a favor. No matter what I say, no matter what I do, please do not let me open another present! Okay?
It's worse. The only thing that's getting me through is knowing that I'm gonna be seeing you soon. I think I may even try to get out of here early.
It's just a little bit more, honey.
IT'S THE HUMIDITY!
You painting his toenails?
Does that smell bother you?
All right, it'll be great! You just make her think you wanna have sex with her! It'll totally freak her out!
Guys, please, I'm just gonna have dinner with him. Okay?
Hey! You smell like perfume and cigarettes.
What are you talking about?! 007 has all those gadgets!
Well, CHP because I used to have a crush on Eric Estrada. And ZXY becuase I think it sounds zexy.
Because Armadillos also wandered in the desert?
Don't you see? It's the perfect crime!
I don't care.
That's-that's not Phase Three.
No, last time you said it like Dracula, and it scared her! Can I get you anything? You want some more ice chips?
No, nononono.. it's just.. things change. People change.
Hello? Eighth street deli?
Umm...
Well I'm Monica Geller, ball like a baby.
My turn? What-what are you talking about?
Yeah, Ginger something.
Was it really that good?
Look. Joey, do you know we can see you from here?
Okay, now Thanksgiving's over, let's get ready for Christmas. Who wants to go get a Christmas tree?!
Rach? Can I talk to for just a minute? I-I dropped some socks.
Are we gonna take a limo?
Sandwiches!
Umm, I just wanna say, uh that with a pinch of exictement, a dash of hard work, a dollup of cooperation, we can have the recipe... Are you gonna kill me?
This is not the bed I ordered!
How about if I dance around all covered in sauce? Huh? You think it's funny now?
You can go.
What happened?
How do you know a mugger?
It's true?!!
Oh that's right, that's what I'd sound like if I exploded.
Wow! Don't you look nice?!
Great!
What?!
Oh, wait a minute honey.
What is wrong with you?!!!
Come on!
Hey, guys. I'm here to pick out my Christmas tree.
Oh.
I know.
I mean I have not been picked on this much since kindergarten and they had to bring in someone from junior high to do the see-saw with me.
Hi.
Hey!
Hey. It's him. Who is it?
Well, what's the job?
Oh, god help us.
Uff.
No!
Okay.
Yeah, the best you got in high school was Wet Pants Geller.
Y'know, I-I... I have to figure...some st-Y'know, some stuff before I can...
Then what's the problem?
Ah, and I mean, he's going out with her? He can not persue this.
Hey! I didn't know either.
I know!
Really?
Wow, do you mean like kiss him-kiss him?
Oh my God! Joey, what did you do after you threw her leg on the fire?
He loves you.
Hi, uh, Richard it's Monica, um, listen I did something kind of crazy tonight, um, maybe I'm getting my period or something, I don't know. Um, anyway, I, I, I beeped into your machine and I heard a message that, that freaked me out, and um, you know what Michelle will tell you the rest. I, I, um, I'm sorry, okay, I, I hope that we can forget the whole thing. Okay, bye.
I just... can't do it.
No, I called him. It's not gonna happen.
What?
Oh THATS ME!
She doesn't have a stomach-ache. She's in labor!
Oh, you are so great! Thank you!
No, if he doesn't like our cookies, too bad, I am not gonna be blackmailed. Look if worse comes to worse, it gets a little warm, we'll call it a theme party.
I mean they're trying to do everything they can to make me quit, and if there were any other job, I would. But this is something I've been waiting for my whole life.
Y'know, in my defense, umm there was no glitter on the macaroni and very little glue.
Really. Well, at least 'big girls' don't pee in their pants in seventh grade!
Nooo!
Look Ross, the only question you need to ask is, "Do you see a future?" I mean like do you see yourself marrying her? Oh my God! You did it already! You married her, didn't you?!
Ohhh, Chandler, sorry! Hey, Janice.
Did you ever, uh, like, think about the future?
This is a garden view room, and we paid for an ocean view room.
I don't know. Look he's a great guy and I love being with him but... you know. Things happen, and they happen. You don't plan these things.
Money is so impersonal. Cookies says someone really cares. . . Alright, we're broke, but cookies do say that.
Hey, look at you! Where have you been?
We'll be right there! Can't you just say it starts later?
Okay well I think...that's your answer.
Three!
Hey Phoebe!
Yeah, a lot. A lot, a lot!
Well it wasn't that many guys. I mean, if you consider how many guys there actually are, it's a very small percentage.
You touch people's eyeballs every day and this feels weird.
Oh my god. We're trying to get pregnant so he's probably starting to freak out about the fact that my body is going to change.
Well I-I talked to and uh, she's definitely going to have this baby. Y'know, she said she was gonna raise it on her own.
Great, now he's waving back.
Okay, just get a lot better. Fast.
We can't split them up!
Let me think. Oh, when I was younger I used to dream that I got married to Mayor McCheese, and on our wedding night I ate his head.
Did you like it?
So do them for free.
Whew. Although y'know, this is part of a salt and pepper set. I mean... I guess y'know it may just count as a half a present. What do you think?
No-no-no, no!
No we're not.
Wait, you like them with me.
Oh no-no-no, it's still me.
Oh, you're so wonderful.
You're not gonna believe this. Okay, so I go over...
Hey guys.
No!
The Luisa from home room!
You kissed a guy?!! Oh my God.
All right.
What?!! What?
All right, we should call somebody.
Why don't you just call her?
I'll bet he's totally over me, I'll bet he's fine.
Ross, I thought you were over this.
What? So you guys don't mind going out with someone else who's going out with someone else?
Phoebe, c'mere. I want to show you something in the bathroom.
Oh good.
That's right! Maybe it's time you took a good hard look at a mirror young lady...old lady...lady!
Well, you-you coulda just turned the cushion over.
Thanks. So, I guess I better be going.
Anything but stew.
Oh no, was I cleaning in my sleep again?
This is so cool, maybe this is something you can do every week.
..well, why don't you tell them? After all it, is your ankle.
From here to the airport?
No! But, they're callin' out to me! I mean this little guy even crawled up into my lap. Oh come on, Chandler wouldn't mind if I opened just one present! What do you think it is?
Run, Phoebe, run!
Oh man! I did it again!
Just go over and say hi.
I proposed to Chandler! Alright, moving on...
Yeah, well I might be if I had the supplies! I mean, I could do all this stuff. Only I don't.
Ha, ha, very funny, very funny. But I think we'd like to give poker another try. Shall we, ladies?
Shrill?! The wedding is back on!
It's the salts.
That's Will from high school!
You just put an empty carton back in the fridge!
Wow, you seem to be doing so much better. That's great. So how-how are things going?
Nothing. I just think it's nice when we're all here together.
Oh good. Good, look I'm so sorry, for screwing up that cutting-her-out plan. But I have a new plan. Chandler agreed to call here in a few minutes with an emergency.
Look, I know that you're in a place right now where you really need to hate Julie's guts, but she didn't do anything wrong. I mean, she was just a girl who met a guy, and now they go out. I really think that if you gave her a chance, you'd like her. Would you just give that a chance, for me?
Oh yeah, right.
Here you go!
You know what probably happened? Someone musta stolen my credit card.
All right, I know you're hurting, and-and I want to be supportive, but don't say that again.
All right, hand me that other box of photos; that's the very last one.
Oh, look! Acting for Beginners! Want to feel good about yourself?
You know what, maybe I don't need to have children. You know maybe I just think I do because that is what society, and by that I mean my mom, has always convinced me that I... I do, I have to have children, I'm sorry, I just do.
Chandler, I'm gonna die a virgin!
This is Chandler's chicken. This is the turkey.
You obviously haven't screwed over a lot of your friends. Which we all appreciate.
Hey Rach, the adoption agency needs letters of recommendation and we were wondering if you would write one for us.
It's a traditional Mexican custard dessert.
Oh, Candy! She was so spunky!
I don't know why.
No, I think we should save our china for something really special. Like if the Queen of England comes over.
No Chandler no! No unscheduled stops. You can go when we stop for gas.
I'm not really here. Just thought I'd drop these off...on the way.. my way... Do you come here a lot? Without me?
Art it is.
I'm sorry I almost made you sleep with Ross.
Oh, c'mon in.
Okay, y'know what, I'm not fine, I'm not. I mean how can I be fine, hearing you come in with her, she wants to see your bedroom.... Y'know what, what if we're friends who don't see other people?
Phoebe, that stuff is...
You did not go!
Hi.
Alright, lets say that it is him, would we not want the baby? No! Would we treat him any differently?
No no no, if I couldn't pay you back right away then I'd feel guilty and tense every time I saw you.
Oh good, another dinosaur story. When are those gonna become extinct?
Oh damn the jellyfish. Damn all the jellyfish!
You're right. I mean I'm sorry. Yeah, I shouldn't be laughing. I should be laying down papers for you!
Put all my money in me.
No. No you can't go. No this is fun. Come on we're just getting started. Here, here's your marker.
Hey Rach, what about this? Huh? Who-who gets this? See, I don't know if I want it because it might be y'know, too many memories!
Okay. I'm guessing that if you don't want to deliver, you probably don't want to pick stuff up either.
Oh God, yes!
Yeah? I'm proud of me too.
No! No you should! A lot of major actors do nude scenes! I mean the chance to star in a movie? Come on!
What were we thinking?
Yeah, I tried to gnaw myself free.
Hey.
Well, maybe you should send him something. So that when he gets to Las Vegas he'll know that you're sorry.
Why do I have to decide?
Maybe we should just tell your parents first.
I don't know, how about the idiot who thought he could drive from Albany to Canada on a half a tank of gas!
Okay, count to three. 1. 2. 3!
Well, didn't you?
Wait! You're supposed to wear a costume!
No, you're the best.
We only ordered one!
Shh!! Wait, what?
No, you don't want this. I want to have your grandmother's cookie recipe.
Oh, put him on!
No, look, she's obviously unstable, okay? I mean she's thinking about running out on her wedding day. Okay, fine! But I mean, look at the position she's putting him in! What's he gonna do? Ross is gonna run over there on the wedding day and break up the marriage?! I mean, who would do that?! Okay, fine, all right, but that's y'know, it's different! Although it did involve a lot of the same people.
Phoebe, why is smoke coming out of the bathroom?!
Umm, she Rach, not it, she.
No!!
No he's not!
Where did you get those jeans?!
No.
Chandler, this is crazy! What did you even say to him! "Come up, meet my wife! Give us your sperm"!
Okay!
You still want to move in together right?
Ok, hypothetically, why won't I be married when I'm 40?
Hi! Umm, I'm Monica Geller, I'm the chef at Alessandro's.
Ooh... she backed out.
I'm fine-d. I'm fine-d! Y'know, it's a really hard word to say.
Okay.
Oh my God!
Oh, it's perfect.
In like a half-hour?
I can't! I spent so much money on them and I told Chandler that I'd wear them all the time, I just can't give them away!
What is the matter with you?! Do you want to fall into the trap? Do you want to fall into the trap?!
All right, you ready?
Yeah. I guess.
All right. Now do it soon, he just asked me how to convert his dollars into Vermont money.
: Joey I am not going to objectify woman with you but if her face is as nice as her ass woah mamma.
You dated her!
All right umm, a string quartet for the procession.
Totally familiar.
Tell him.
Damn it!
He didn't die. I saw his daughter last week. Said he was fine. Her on the other hand, botched Botox.
I am really an idiot. you see, I was filling out my friend's form, and instead of putting her information, I put mine.
Chandler, I think I'm sick.
Ohh! Ohhhh! Were you sleeping sweetie? I'm sorry. Here.
Hey, thank you. Thank you so much. . You are SO going to Heaven!
Hey!
Hi guys!
All right. Tell me if this is too cute. Lesbian wedding, chicken breasts.
It's your birthday!
I thought you said you were going to do nothing.
Are you saying I smell bad?
Well actually, Ross doesn't.
Ross and Rachel don't know what they're talking about. I mean its not like their so responsible. Emma is a product of a bottle of Merlot and a five year old condom.
Yeah, me too!
Ok everybody, it's time for flan.
I don't believe this! When someone asks you in for lemonade, and to you that means they wanna have sex?
No, I want you to have a job that you love. Not statistical analysis and data reconfiguration.
Why? Do you think he's still mad at us?
It's 2101 and I am not amused. . Ok, the bride and groom have a few words they'd like to say.
You can't say that!! You-you don't know!! I mean I thought I was gonna pass out from the pain! Anyway I-I tried, but I-I couldn't...bend that way. So...
Well I didn't want everyone to think I was stupid.

This is so great! Now we can enter into doubles tournaments!
Chandler!
Oh God. I'm so sorry.
Oh, here's a great one.
Who do you wanna fool around with?
Okay, how much?
Feminine stuff.
This is kind of a classy place.
Oh, and the newspaper delivery guy.
Hey, Joey, I don't think that you should leave Chandler alone. I mean it's only been two days since he broke up with Kathy. Maybe you can go fishing next week?
I think you're better than you think you are.
We won't. 300?
Ok, you got it!
They've only been going out for a few weeks and Phoebe is completely hung up on Mike! She'll say "No", David's heart will be broken, it will be too hard for them to recover from and then Phoebe will end up alone again.
Really?!
Well, I thought that I would cut up the tomatos.
And that's why, I'm not inviting you in for a drink. Bye.
Okay, I think I get how to do this.
That was me.
Oh my God.
Well, I was thinking, that you gave the guys such great haircuts, I thought, maybe you'd like to do mine?
Well, you broke up with Julie Grath! How much weight could she have gained?
Yeah-yeah, y'know what? Yeah, that's it-that's it, everything will be mine! Nothing will be yours! That's-that's what I said! Oh come on, Chandler! I'm talking about the barca lounger! It just, it doesn't match! Where is it gonna go?!
Oh, Aunt Liddy's coming? That means we get five dollars each!
Totally!
Nothing.
Yeah, yeah, and you were going him y'know, your flower.
All right, hold on okay? First thing's first. Okay, now did Ross sit anywhere while he was naked?
Rachel, listen to your mother. She is very smart.
Good, they feel good, in my head.
Hi.
What?!
Sometimes I have bad dreams.
YES!!!!!!!!
I'm so glad you liked it.
And! We also have speaker phone.
Okay, just back off mister! Whoa. 'Cause I am ready to have a baby. I just want Joey to be the father.
You're not gonna go anywhere, you said you were gonna eat here, and you're gonna eat here!
Noo!!
Umm, going to the beach. When it stays light real late.
The pink one with the flowers?!
I know. I need more pie.
You went out with Wallis Pincer?
Nice.
She will be after tonight.
Ok, for my next song I think I'll sing something a little more upbeat. All right? Oh, how about the PointerSisters "I am so excited". And make it bouncy!
Hey, let me tell them!
All right, I'll see you guys later.
Okay, Mike and Joey, get in position. Chandler, come with me.
Shut up, the camera adds ten pounds.
Hey! How did it go with Elizabeth?
It's so good, that I feel really selfish about being the only one who's eating it, that I think we should have everyone taste how good it is. Especially Ross.
And Monica knows...
Phyllis sees what I'm doing.
Oh no no no no... this is dangerous territory. Keep it clean!
I got it! How about, if we win, they have to get rid of the rooster?
Hey guys.
Ready for your birthday lunch?
Oh my god.
Hey Pheebs!
Really?
Oh no! My parents have never seen me drunk! That they know of.
Well, we appreciate anything you can tell us.
Ohh, how is he?
Yes you did. Absolutely.
All right, sweetie that's fine. You didn't do it on purpose.
It's...still beautiful.
Ooh, candy bars, crossword puzzles...
You have got to go home!
No I totally disagree. No I think it's fine for a guy to do something like that. Such you an actor. Not that you need to,your eyebrows are...
That's the surprise!
I know, I just thought it would be fun.
In the hall.
Yeah, well you call her and tell her that y'know when we were kids her precious little Frannie tried to undress me several times, okay? And if I hadn't have stopped her, there probably wouldn't even be a wedding to go too.
Fifteen minutes.
Gotcha. When do we tell them about this?
Joey just hired Chandler to be his assistant!
And a lot could still get in our way.
No leg-chewing for us sir.
What?
Okay, those people just left, come on! Quick! Give him the money and get their table!
I can't believe this. Do you think that your parents could help pay for it?
Oh, blablablabaybaybay.
No. Why?
No! Joey and Ross don't know anything and Chandler still thinks that Phoebe's pregnant.
I can't believe we are at a real college party! I have to pee so bad!
Oh God, stop with the plan! So what, so what you saw him with a girl? Who cares?! That doesn't mean anything! Now look, you're going to go out on a date with Danny and you're going to be so charming he's gonna forget all about that stupid subway girl.
Hey-hey, how goes the dancing? Gay yet?
I know!
Why is everything different?
Poor thing!
'Scuse us
How, how did that happen?
Oh Joey, Melanie called, said she's gonna be late.
Oh, wow, so you're gonna be one of those "healthy, healthy, healthy guys"?
No time for that!
Hey!
I'll meet you there in two minutes.
Wait, wait, wait!
Um, I'm not actually Amish.
How's it going?
Oh no!
What are you doing here? You can't be here!
Alright, I've got a leg, three breasts and a wing.
Ok.
I'm changing out of this.
You just wanna each take one?
Exactly. Oh, I love that I can be totally neurotic around you now. Tell me the truth. Don't you like it better now that everything on your desk is perpendicular?
I'm not sick!! I don't get sick! Getting sick is for weaklings and for pansies!
What?!
Okay, everybody relax. This is not even a date. It's just two people going out to dinner and- not having sex.
Hell yeah!!!
Okay, here's batch 22. Ohh, maybe these'll taste a little like your grandmother's. This has a little bit of orange peel, but no nutmeg.
Joey!
Okay, all right, I think you're great, I think you're sweet, and you're smart, and I love you. But you will always be the guy who peed on me.
Oh my god! Did you hear that? She said Monica! Oooh, I can't leave her!
God, this adoption stuff is so overwhelming. There's inter-country adoption, dependency adoption.. There are so many ways to go, and this is like the biggest decision of our lives.
Alright that's great, then just go. Go Knicks.
He had to go, there's a deer just outside eating fruit from the orchard.
I promise you, he would definitely want you back.
She said WHAT?
Well y'know, I'm just-I'm just worried that bosses will see them and think they pay you too much money. Or! Or your assistant will see them and-and want a raise!
Well, honey, it is pretty competitive. I mean I've got an actual rocket scientist here.
Do you umm, you really think the best reason to get married is because you're sorry?
Because, you were mean to me and you, you teased me and you always, always got your way.
Congratulations, I think youve found the worlds thinnest argument.
Oh, gosh, I'm sorry.
Damnit Phoebe! How did you even call him?
No! I was just getting into position and then everything went dark.
Alright, I'm gonna go pick up a few things for the trip.
Hello. Oh, hey Ross!
You al-you already had it?
No reason. I-I keep private things in there.
How many fingers am I holding up?
Uh yeah, I-I actually I thought about you a couple months ago.
No I didn't. I asked, "got the ke-eys?"
Oh my God! I love that!
Thats not how you see me, is it? Phoebe while cutting a sweet potatoe in the air: No you're all about the fun.
See what happens when you give people advice? I hope you told him not to?
Oh God, I'm so sorry.
That was that girl Megan! She booked the Swing Kings on the day of our wedding and said that I couldn't have them back unless I gave her the dress!
The basket is totally empty! My God, the neighbors ate all the candy!
Okay, listen, there's still some of Chandler's medicine under the sink in the bathroom. Bye!
Ohh.
Honey, listen... You have nothing to worry about with Geoffrey.
We weren't picking up, it's Amanda!
Phoebe!
Alright, great. Thanks a lot. I'm going to tap class.
I don't know who I'm happiest for...
You promised Dr. Weinburg, you'd never use that phrase.
I don't know.
Is anyone thankful for anything else besides a thong?
Thank you. My hair is very amused.
Merry Christmas!!
Does it have to do with-with Chandler and that sock that he keeps by his bed?
You are married though.
Why won't I be married when I'm 40?
Why not?
Betrothed...
Well, this is the last box of your clothes. I'm just gonna label it, "What were you thinking?"
Because he'll know what to do? Oh my God, you're a genius!
Alright. My job here is done.
They won't take you to the vet.
What?!
Do NOT let me sit in one of those. We'll be here for days.
I don't remember. Do you wanna take a walk?
Phoebe and Rachel saw you with Nancy today and... em... they think you're having an affair.
Hi. It is so, so nice to meet you.
I can't! I have to work!
Nope, she's perfect.
Why not?
Hi! There you are.
Have fun.
Well?
They're kissing let's just go around them.
Sure! It doesn't mean anything! Just like I know it doesn't mean anything with you!
Okay, so you were trying to play bad this whole time.
All right, I'll try not to.
Honey, cover it up with the boat!
No.
What?!
That counts!
Phoebe, y'know why don't we just go upstairs and have some birthday cake?
Where's Benny? There he is! Where's Benny, there he is.
I'll put a pillowcase over my head.
Phoebe, where's your purse?
This isn't mine. Hey, this isn't, this isn't my stuff! Ugh, Ross! These are your boxes! Where are my boxes?
Really?
Alright, well I'm tearing the lettuce.
Chandler has two copies of Annie!
..Excuse me?
Or not.
How did you get in here?
What are you doing here?
Hey! Joey said no autographs! But if she's gettting one, then I want one too: To Monica. And none of this "best wishes" crap. I want "love".
Sit down! We're winning!
Hang on a second I just got in.
Continue...
No. No. Not it. Not it. Not it. Don't crowd me! This is it! This is the dress! Oh my God, it's perfect! I'm sorry, this one's taken! Whoa!
It could be Amanda!
Hi honey. We just got a wedding gift from Bob and Faye Bing; they don't like us do they?
I meant, why don't you take Richard to the game? What?
Wait a minute, you stayed home all day and played Ms. Pac-Man while I went off to work like some kind of chump?!
What are you doing?
What?! I thought he'd love it! His favorite kid's book was the Velveteen Rabbit!
Which we are, and-and we already paid for it. It's My Giant!
Hey, where is this guy, it's been over an hour!
Nice work everybody! So much for the y'know, "You can drive it, but don't tell Rachel" plan!
So how you doing today? Did you sleep okay? Talk to Barry? I can't stop smiling.
These tiny, little non-breasts?! Please, it's gotta be Rachel.
You're meeting Richard?
I feel terrible.
Don't you just love it?
Hey Phoebe... how you doin'? You feelin' better?
That's true! I knew I married you for a reason!
No! We only mess around at his place!
Hi!
C'mon give me five more. Five more.
I want a baby.
Okay, we're gonna need a distraction.
Hey!
Ohh, sweetie! Hey, I bet you anything that he's gonna call you again.
Phoebe, stop writing about us!
You really liked it?
Phoebe, you do seem a little tense. Here, let me help you.
Phoebe, that is awful!
Ross, cough drops, please?
OK, try this salmon mousse.
Because you're on my team! And my team always wins!
Y'know what, this is obviously some kind of twisted joke she's trying to play on him.
What's 'pleh'?
Hi!
What's with the guitar?
Well, who's voice was that?
It's wrong. You know what else is wrong? Phoebe picking Rachel.
Ok listen, you go down to the pool and reserve the chairs, and I'll get the magazines and the lotion.
Who is also in charge of purchasing.
It's so unfair, you don't even like your job!
All right, look, nobody's smoking pot around all this food.
Whatever you decide, whatever you do.
Damn it! Rookie mistake!
Noo! I'll stay. He's my brother.
I... I'm sorry, did you say something? I can't hear through all this damned hair!
Ohh! Fish, seaweed, a sunken ship.
She is unbelievable, our mother is...
Thank you! You haven't said anything... 3rd Customer: Actually I do have one small complaint.
Oh, I know! Umm, is it because he's always correcting people's grammar? Whom! Whom! Sometimes it's who!
Hey umm, what's this?
Ok.
Oh, that's what I would do, forget mine.
They tore it down a few days early.
Yes!!
Ross! The neighbors ate all my candy!!
Gunther, can I get a coffee to go?
Because Purvry Perverson over here can't stop staring at her.
Oh yeah .
Oh God! What did I just step on?
That guy stood on your neck until you passed out!
Hey. Okay, so umm, since that video camera thing didn't work out uh, I thought that I would give you just a little preview.
We're gonna have sex.
Alright, you know what? That's it. You've had your chance.
Joey! You didn't even know her!
Oh well umm, I make it myself! It's two parts ammonia and one part lemon juice. And now the secret ingredient is...y'know what? We just met.
Hey.
Hey!
You said you loved me! I can't believe this!
Why, what's wrong with my bathroom floor?
All right, I'll take one box of the mint treasures, just one, and that's it. I-I started gaining weight after I joined the Brown Birds. Remember, how Dad bought all my boxes and I ate them all?
Uh, where do you think you're going?
Oh. Well then way to go you big movie star!
Welcome home. I've missed you. join me in the bedroom?
Can you blame him?
What's up?
No, they were really cool. They were on their honeymoon too!
Hey, are you okay?
Hi Chandler.
What's going on?
Wait-wait!! Okay, stop it! Stop it! Stop! Now listen, no one's gonna fight in this apartment.
Are you gonna dress up as Santa?
We're just making conversation.
Upstairs in the bathroom right before you felt up mom.
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
No! no! Let's figure out a fair way to decide who's staying.
It's not your birthday.
You realize what you are don't you?
Oh My God.
Mm-mh. I printed them out on my computer.
Excuse me, sir, would it help if I weren't wearing underpants?
I can cook and you can take care of the money.
Phoebe, what is it?
All right...
That's right Patrick, bye-bye!
Edward Nevski?
I don't want a beer.
That's not true, you don't have a moustache.
Well, we... "bore false witness"... See I could be a reverend.
Let go! I'm a tiny little woman!!
Joey, do you work here?
Okay, y'know what? Don't worry, okay? We'll take care of it. We'll call her. Just go home and get ready.
That doesn't seem fair.
No, seriously.
Baddest. Otherwise the song would be Fat Fat Leroy Brown.
But what?
Okay. All right, turkey. Eh, that won't work. Cheese? That won't work. Olive loaf? I hope that won't work.
Oh, um, I don't know if that's a good idea.
Hey!
What?!
I'm sorry, why is this girl going to call me?
Joey, this is sick, it's disgusting, it's, it'snot really true, is it?
The woman from the museum called and said that there was a cancellation and that we could move up our wedding and Chandler heard! I know! How bad is this?!
What's the matter, officer? Has someone been bad?
In.
Which ones?
All right people listen, I've got exactly twenty-eight minutes before I have to baste again.
Phoebe! Rachel! It's Monica! I wonder what you could possibly need me for on such short notice! Oh.
Come on! Come on, I was kidding! It was such an obvious joke!
You can, I know you can!
What?
You have nothing! You're not even going out! You're her baby sitter! You have a 12-year-old girl's job!
Well, because you signed it baby kangaroo Tribbiani . Hey, why don't you stop worrying about sounding smart and just be yourself!
Hi, come in! Paul, this is.. ... everybody, everybody, this is Paul.
I actually know someone in advertising. I grew up with this guy who is a vice president at a big agency. Maybe I can get him to meet you? Give me the phone.
Wow, isn't it ironic that David would show up on the same day that you and Mike exchange keys?
Toe the line. Thread the needle. Think outside the box!
Absolutely!
Hi.
Y'know what, champ? I think I'll pass.
Monica.
What are you guys doing here?
Toe the line. Thread the needle. Think outside the box!
'Scuse me?
No it's not! You want it, you're gonna have to win it!
No, no, don't get it. Let the machine pick up.
Just figured, 'cause you and Ross are...
What about all the guys that you've got the phone numbers from? Why don't you just kiss one of them?
WE'RE GETTING A BABY!
Okay! Very funny! Somebody let me out please?! Come on, I'm cold! And covered in marinara sauce! Come on! Let me out!
I know! I know! I know!
When Mom and Dad drove you to the hospital to get your nose fixed, I swam into the lake and fished it out.
Michael.
There you go, enjoy your coffee.
When you get a sec, another round of daiquiris.
That's Bill Clinton.
No. Big deal, so you have a side of the bed, everybody has a side of the bed.
All right shut up for a second and let me just see something. Oh, wow!
I saved you a seat.
Hi sweetie, look before I forget, did I leave my diaphram at your place? Hi mom.
Chandler that's crazy! If you give up every time you'd have a fight with someone you'd never be with anyone longer than-Ohhh!
I can't believe Joey's having lunch with his stalker. What i-, what is she like.
It's in the kitchen, I'll go get it.
Well, that's it. Everything's packed.
Ohh! Did you do what I said? Did-did-did you tell her?
Okay, good luck!
Count in our heads as-as good Madlibs.
And that would be?
You know what, Ross? I'm gonna throw in 50 bucks for you.
What?! You can't-what did you tell her?
Maybe you don't need him to propose to you, maybe you can propose to him!
I'm making cookies for Erica. And oh, by the way, we have to leave for the airport soon, her plane comes in about an hour.
Uh, huh. Or maybe to a galaxy far, far away.
Yeah! Hey! Thanks for getting me that girl's number.
You're gonna what?
I'm not touching you.
I can't believe we're here.
We're kidding!
No-no, I-I just, I liked them so much that I went out and bought some for myself.
Oh, from who?
All right uh, the important thing is to take your time, you want to hit 'em all, and you mix 'em up. You gotta keep them on their toes.
Then why did you move?!
Well, it's done about two minutes before it looks like that.
Rachel, if you want the little round waffles, you gotta have to wait until I find the little waffle iron.
Hello?
Nice! Wow Phoebe you are good!
It's okay! It's good! It's good. It's a disease!
No it's not!
Chandler, that's like your fourth cup of coffee!
I mean I-I don't I think I have enough quarters.
I think we found a place.
What happened?
What-what was it you were gonna tell us?
I've been pretty good!
I know.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You know what, the way you did it was just fine.
Yeah?
Thank you!
What do you say?
Oh my god, Emma. Oh, sweetie, I forgot you were here. Oh, you're right, we can't do this. We can't leave her alone.
Oh, I've got it! I have got it! Pictures from your childhood. This will get you going good!
Oh my God! YOU FORGOT THE PIES? Well, I cannot believe this. You force me to make dinner, then you're an hour late and you forget the one little thing that I asked you to do.
You ordered a stripper for the shower?! That is totally inappropriate!
Say what?
Really? I only had two glasses.
Hey!
Wouldn't you be?
I'm sorry too.
You see that guy? He's in classics now, but y'know as soon as we leave he's going straight to the porn.
Let's see. Congress is debating a new deficit reduction bill... the mayor wants to raise subway fares again... the high today was forty-five... and- oh, teams played sports.
Nothing.
What?
Yeah, I don't hear Chandler's and he doesn't hear mine.
Wow. Then I would definitely not recommend Mrs. Doubtfire.
Honey, you gotta talk to her.
Hi!
What are you crazy?!
Hi, good morning lover. I gotta say after last night, I'm a little weak in the knees.
Hey sweetie.
Okay, just stay there a couple more hours and if she doesn't show up by then, then just come on home.
Okay. But wait, we can't. My Cousin Cassie is in the guest room, we're supposed to have lunch.
Thank you.
Oh! So you think I'm a failure!
That's a good question. Look umm, last night we let the dice decide. Maybe we should leave it up to fate again. I love you!
Who the hell are you?!
I have you scheduled for nudity at 2300 hours.
Wait a minute, she isn't... She's not the one who you...
Just waiting for you sweetie.
No, it just remind me of something this guy did today at work. I told you about that funny guy, Geoffrey, right?
If it is a new message, what is he calling to say?
Oh, I know, I never wear fake ones. I just did it so my Mom wouldn't give me grief about me biting them.
Fun? Fun, you think this is fun?
You're still gonna pay me, right? Or something a little less selfish.
What? what? He obviously thinks that's a nice way to be proposed to, plus he'd never suspect it!
I don't want a cat!
You are just the sweetest.
Yeah, let-let-let's pretend that's not true.
Well, what kind of food is he looking for?
Limited seating my ass. Let's see who made the cut. Hi!
The players.
Oh, you're so sweet. Oh, but wait, what about our, what about the future and stuff?
That's because I-I was just grabbing some things out of the dryer, and it's static cling. Or maybe it's just that God knew I'd be running into you and saw an opportunity.
Because then I don't have to!
Well, maybe she thought that with all of your history it could be, you know, implicit.
'Dear Dr. Remore, know that I love you and would do anything to have you.' Gosh. 'Your not-so-secretive admirer, Erica Ford.' Ooh wait, 'PS enclosed please find 14 of my eyelashes.'
So! He'll understand!
I'm so sorry. Please, stop freaking out.
Yeah, we named the boy Jack after dad.
That's it big girl! Come on!
Ross, your little creatures got the remote again.
Well, an-anyway, I just-that night meant a lot to me, I guess I'm just trying to say thanks.
Ahh, Pete, the other day when you said you needed to talk, umm, just so I know, is it good news or bad news.
Oh Ross, sometimes grown-ups have commitments they just can't get out of!
What's the matter?
Sex!
Oh man, they think they are so slick messing with us! But see they don't know that we know that they know! So...
I've got a question. Richard made plans again with the guys.
Really?
Well, I don't care! That-that turkey has to feed 20 people at my parent's house and they're not gonna eat it off your head!
Oh, he's sober alright. Just turns out that Fun Bobby was fun for a reason.
Yeah, but without the costumes.
Aww!
What if something gets broken, they're so expensive.
Here we go again.
What are you doing with the lamp?
You invite my brother, you invite my whole family, and not me?! Why?! What-Why wouldn't you want me at your wedding? What could I have possibly done?! Stuart!
Oh my God, you can't even see where the Titanic hit it.
So I hide in the shower and the next thing you know they're going at it right on the bathroom floor.
Oh! Me too!
Okay.
Oh, thank you!
Call us when you get there.
Right. Till I bought a blow dryer, then I was shunned.
Bye sweetie, I love you.
You're not gonna mess it up.
So the wedding caterer sent me this list of twelve appetizers and I have to narrow it down to six.
Now calm down Joey.
I used to wet my bed.
Well what are you gonna do when he finds out he wasn't even asked?!
I just thought it would be nice if I could have just this one night!
Look, here's a picture of Scotty Jared naked.
No!
Okay, but wouldn't it be easier if you had to tell me something that you could tell me.
Okay, we're gonna start in the kitchen. Plates get put into plate protectors and stacked ten to a box. The silverware gets bundled in rubber bands and then bubble wrapped. Got it?
This is amazing. I mean, how, how did this happen?
Wow!
Oh my god, where's my purse? No, you know what? I can replace everything in there. Get that binder, and let's go!
No. He's not a horrible guy.
Okay!
Hey!!
Alright, for the bizillionth time, yes I see other women in shower at the gym, and no I don't look.
Anyway, how did it go with Kate?
He used to lock himself in the basement for hours. No one was every allowed to hear, "The Sound."
Rachel, it's going to happen. Chandler is gonna move in here.
Oh wait! You didn't just sit on my Kit-Kats did you?!!
Y'see, this is where you'd use that 'hello' word we talked about.
Ohh, everybody at the restaurant still hates me.
Shut up, the camera adds ten pounds.
What?!! You cannot tell him that!!
No, that landed in your food!
Oh I'm working on my toast for the party, or as I like to call it. Sob fest 2002. Hey check this out.
Weeeell, it's rum, and-
He's a dropper!
Oh, I'll have an espresso. Oh acutally, I'll get it. If I ask you to, you'll probably end up drinking it yourself.
When I take a shower, she leaves me little notes on the mirror.
Chandler there's nothing wrong with crying! I mean you don't have to be so macho all the time.
Y'know what? After you're with this woman for like ten minutes, you forget all that. I mean, she is this astounding person, with this, with this amazing spirit.
Honey, you can relax. Last night at work, Geoffrey told this really sexist joke. After that, not so funny anymore.
I didn't mean to cut it off. It was an accident.
Okay, I've got a question. If you had to pick one of us to date, who would it be?
Hey, you guys.
Y'know what, you can play with my dollhouse.
You can also find him under umm, dog and dead.
Y'know if it's any consolation, he really did sound like he was having more fun with you.
Wow, really? One time he just looked at my bra and it popped open.
Which one is which again?
I can't believe you bought this.
Stop it!! That's not funny!!
Hey, Rachel, isn't that stuff almost pure...
Wait Chandler come on, let's-it's not a big deal!
So?!
Of course you can look at it! Yeah, I want your opinion too!
You're really sticking with the shell necklace huh?
Oh dear God!
It wasn't fun?!
I'll meet somone else. There'll be other Alans.
Hey, I've come to terms with it, you have to too.
But the mess!
I'm fine now, but it was really scary there for a while. I mean, someone slipped a-a threatening note under the door.
Hi.
Ohh!
Joey!
Hi.
Wow, this really sucks.
Okay. Right. Oh my God that is gonna be so hard.
Who is this?
Ow, what are the chances!
Well, high school was not my favourite time.
Hey. Ross, did you know Mom and Dad are going to Puerto Rico for Thanksgiving?
Very good, so good.
This isn't easy for me either. I wish things were different, I... If you were a few years older, or if I was a few years younger, or if we lived in biblical times, I would really...
...in this day and age how dumb do you have to be to get pregnant?
Please... Chandler is the love of my life... ... oooh leather pants! Have Mercy! Ross: So, eh... it's probably gonna be hard for you to leave Boston, huh?
Uch. I am still so mad at you for smoking.
So, I'll get candles and my mom's lace tablecloth, and since it's Rachel's birthday, I mean, we want it to be special, I thought I'd poach a salmon.
Are we still on that?
Yeah. And y'know, if you wanna cry, that's okay too.
Well, if it annoys you so much, then why do you do it?
Welcome to our side of the tunnel.
You, and you, you're supposed to be at my party. And Gunther! What are you doing here?
See ya.... Waitwait, what's with you?
Hey, it's good to see you!
Know when to stop.
Honey! Do you know that none of that stuff came from me?! I mean I never said I wanted to have babies and get married right now!
Wait, Joey! Joey! That doesn't mean that-that you're in love with me!
Oh, no thanks.
What?!
Okay, look, I-I have enough stuff for one more sandwich, I mean I was going to eat it myself, but
I love you!
If that falls off the truck, it wouldn't be the worst thing.
Let me get you some coffee.
Oh!!
What?!
Yeah, well you promised Barry, you'd marry him.
What?!
Oh, wait a minute! Who's is the father?!
I know this is embarrassing, but nobody cares! No one here even knows you!
Oh my God!
Yeah? What does she think of your little science project?
Yeah, I'm sure your ex-wife will be more than happy to move to another country so you can patch things up with your new wife.
Wow. Joey, how do you do it?
Hey.
I know that switch does something, okay? So-so I went down to city hall and got these. All I had to do was pay $25 and wait in line for three hours.
I've gotta get back in the game.
Rachel's at work.
Honey. Uh, not to sound too Florence Henderson but, dinner's on the table.
Hey, hey, look. Look Ross, Ben drew a picture of you! Huh? You're-you're a cowboy!
Uh- Rachel has left the building, can you call back?
Oh my God, sit down! Sit down! How long as it been since we've seen each other?
Think about it.
Joey that is so sweet.
Is it the same thing that Chandler had?
Uh!
Come on guys! Suck it up! We're closing in on ten hours! It's gut-check time!
Awww, y'know what your nickname is, Mr. Big...
Okay.
Other wall, people! Other wall!
I'm talking about me having a baby.
Aren't you gonna...
He would just roll me over and I would stop snoring.
I look like a man??
How about, you're moving!!
Really? Why?
Really?
When I fall asleep on the couch after reading, she covers me over with a blanket.
Alright, we don't know that it's him. I mean, it could be the football guy.
All right, were you guys smoking something in the back of our van?
All right, all right. Maybe I can fit them in if I just do some rearranging. But uh, Rachel may actually have to sit at the bar!
Yes, because all good plans start with, "I'll go down the fire escape."
uh huh.. I mean these things happen. Its' just a plate. Its not like somebody died.
Grand Supreme Little Darling?
Are you okay? You've been acting weird all afternoon.
Really?
Once!!
Oh no, we can't walk!
I thought you could use the help.
What?
Okay. God well, we gotta go back and get them!
I'm glad you're here, we have a couple of things to ask you about the wedding ceremony.
Okay, here's your penis!
Oh give it a rest!
What do you mean "what do we do"?
Y'know, I think if I were going to be with a woman. It'd, it'd be with someone like Michelle, she was so oh, she was so petite.
What these? Oh, these are, um, for.. cuts and scrapes.
He's so cute.
Did you also have his album, It's Not Easy Being Green?
Ross, we're kind of in the middle of diner here.
I think it's totally insane, I mean, they work for the hospital. It's like returning to the scene of the crime. You know, I say we blow off the dates.
I cant believe you. You still havent told that girl she doesnt have a job yet?
He is so amazing.
Nooo! Never! I mean, we're living in the moment. God, it is so nice for once to not have to get all hung up on 'Where is this going?'
...Pheebs?
Look at us all dressed up for the big office party! By the way, what are we celebrating?
What?
Phoebe, your face is fine! Come on, none of this stuff is going to happen to you! Stop being such a baby!
Yeah, in-in-in the bathroom.
Wait Chandler, what are you doing?!
Oh wait, you know what, I got it, I got it, pretend like you just woke up, okay, that will throw her off. Be sleepy.
Tim wait!
So we can be friends who sleep together.
I wish all guys could be like him.
Phoebe, that's how it starts. I don't need to eat the cake, I'll just smell the icing... why don't I just eat a little sliver, or, okay, just a slice or two. And next thing you know, you're 210 pounds and you get wedged in going down the tunnel slide. Phoebe, honey, I know this is hard. Look, if you talk to him, you're going to wanna see him. And if you see him, you're going to want to get back together with him. I know that's not what you want. Give me your phone.
Chandler, wait. It goes: Old job, new job, you. This is just something I have to do.
I had to go with the odds Rach.
That is the unusual activity. Look, they just wanna see if you're okay.
We are going to Dick Clark's New Year's Rocking Eve!
Changes?
I have no idea. But look how much they spent!
Well, this must've brought back some really bad memories for you, Ross.
They want me to do it, which is really cool, seeing as I've never catered before, and I really need the money, and this isn't a problem for you, is it?
But what if it is better than ours? Should we at least look?
Who, who are they?
You see, if we'd gone around them like I said, we-She would've given us those tickets. Damnit!
Me too!
Oh...
Yeah, but Janice? That-that was like the worst breakup in history!
Okay, fine.
What?
Here!
The Bible?!
Hey!
All right, Chandler get the coats. Erica let's go. Phoebe and Joey, keep packing! Oh my God we're gonna have a baby. All right. We're gonna have a baby! OH MY GOD, WE'RE GONNA HAVE A BABY! Oh God, oh God, I got to sit down, I got to sit down. Ooh!
Stick out your tongue.
What's with him?
Yeah? The work problem?
That was you?
Just breathe, breathe.. that's it. Just try to think of nice calm things...
Yes you did. You absolutely sold me...
No Phoebe, those are like the side affects and stuff.
Forget it.
Yeah, I'm sure.
Oh, sorry!
After the snap!
Chasing him all around the room?
Joey!
All right fine, your guy may have a great body, but our guy is really funny.
What?
Ross!
But we love our house.
All right, let's go say good-bye.
I'm sorry honey.
What?
Yes you are! That's the only way to explain all this stuff!
My surprise party!
That's not even a game!
Look, I don't even know how I feel about him yet. Just give me a chance to figure that out.
Al-alright, l-look you guys, this is the best relationship I've been in. . .
No you learn these things. You grow into it.
Good, so do it Saturday night because we're going to dinner with her and Clark.
Well, I actually had the weirdest conversation with Joey. He was talking about rules and right and wrong and...
Sure.
And it's a magnet!
Hi.
Okay, you can not tell Chandler. Okay? That I ran into Richard.
Oh really? Okay? Well what would you say if I told you that, y'know, Ross or Chandler could beat you up?
Hey!
Thanks, I'm set. Do you still live with your parents?
Bye!
Oh-oh, no no don't worry, I'm gonna wash it.
I have no moves. Okay, whatcha doin' there?! Oh y'know what? I'm sorry, this is just too weird.
What did he tell you?
You're wrong! The centerpieces are fine! Do you ever get scared at all?
Maybe this wasn't your shot.
Ugh! Well, y'know, we were away...
Not it!
Chandler! It happens to lots of guys! You-you-you were probably tired, you had a lot of champagne, don't worry about it!
Didn't you hear that speech? If you don't kiss him then I will!
We just want you to think it through.
Mira, Ross, Marcel se llevo el control remoto.
Well we... we kinda broke up.
Oh, so you finally took it out of the marina huh?
Y'know what? I-I don't want a big, fancy wedding.
AFFIRMATIVE!
Okay, you're-you're really freaking me out.
David who?
I'm a good person. And I'm a good chef, and I don't deserve to have marinara sauce all over me! Y'know what, if you want me to quit this bad, then all you have to do is...
Yeah. It's my dad's birthday, I decided to give him a stroke.
Wow! I can't believe I actually rolled an eight.
okay, right.
Hi...May I help you?
Well, next time your massaging him, you should try and distract yourself.
I'll get it. Hello. Hi Emily! Yeah, uh you-you tracked him down. Hold on one second.
That's your call.
What?!
Really Phoebs? Because, you know, you'd have to be an actual waitress. This can't be like your 'I can be a bear cub' thing.
It's not a date, okay. I'm just gonna teach him how to make lasagne for some pot luck dinner he has.
Aww, man!
What are you talking about? She obviously lives on the second floor, seventh apartment from the left!
Hey, I just whipped us up some Easy Bake treats, they should be ready in about three days.
Ugh, we're screwed, aren't we? You know what? Just tell me on the way to the bird store.
Look, there's Chandler. You knew, that stupid friend of Ross'. Said I'm fat. You know I've already lost 4 pounds!
Fine. She's wearing my bra!
Oh-ho, look what I got Julio.
I don't know! Why don't you just explain? What do they want? Find out what they want!
Ohh!
New York.
Hey. Okay, I gave him another chance, but Tim has got to go!
What happened to Santa, Holiday Armadillo?
Sure!
Hey!
I also, did a little something in fur. But umm, that's really just for me. Okay. So, why don't you go into your room and try these on and we'll see-get a better idea of what's gonna work.
Yes, but you are dead inside.
Joey, you don't have too!
It's never taken you more than a shower to get over a relationship.
Heads! No, Tails! He-he-heads!
Well, I-I-I-I... I don't know...
We're gonna see each other naked.
And yet, we're still poking him.
Y'know, I don't like to brag about it, but I give the best massages!
I thought there wasn't a ball?
You're Lewis Posin.
Okay.
Hey! Where 'ya headin' in those pants? 1982?
Oh my god, little Stevie Fisher? How've you been?
Okay! Oh my God, thank you!!
I know. Closing credits.
Oh, that's because I had lunch with Rich-Me neither! Okay, what do I want now?
Yeah, it did.
So you can like, bite, and pull people's hair and stuff?
Rachel, that's all we do.
So, are you sorry that I told them?
Joey, I'm in!
Chandler! I have to tell you, you smell so smokey I have to get up. I'm not kidding.
Well, that was weird. You were loud, and I was fast.
Whoa! Whoa!! Tackled by a girl! Bet ya don't see that everyday, do ya?
Oh, what are we gonna do! I don't wanna see her!!
This is unbelievable.
I think that's you.
Yeah, I'm sorry. I'm-I'm so sorry.
How do you feel?
No! No, she doesn't. Uh Phoebe, what she makes-that's uh-they're sock rabbits. They are completely different-Okay! Okay! Okay! I didn't make it! I'm sorry! I totally forgot about tonight and the fact that we're supposed to make the presents!
Okay. Okay, I'm ready. Come on big fella!
Joey, that paper's like a year old!
No! Are you doing it?! I don't hear anything! Come on!
Are you still awake?
Hey, I could've had you if I wanted you.
I can't believe you're dressing up for him. I mean, you're just, you're setting yourself up all over again.
You know, if you just wait another... six and a half minutes...
So that marriage stuff that you were saying yesterday, you don't really believe that do you?
This woman's got my life, I should get to see who she is.
Chandler! Everyone--no one's eating my Tuscan finger food 'cause they're all filling up on Phoebe's snow cones!
What?
Who? Who do you know that are friends that just fool around?
Please? Please?! We just don't want to deal with telling everyone, okay? Just promise you won't tell.
I would get a room with this cake. I think I could show this cake a good time!
Well, it's the thought. Hey, doesn't Ross's flight get in in a couple hours? At gate 27-B?
131!
My God, Rachel, I can't believe Phoebe made out with Ralph Lauren. Ohh, I'm so jealous.
I'm really gonna miss you.
Oh, god, I am so spoiled... That's it!
Brides magazines?
So it looks like it's going really well for you two, huh?
Fine, I'll rub it on myself.
Hey!
That's sounds great, but how are you going to afford it?
OK!
Name one of his books.
Oh. Maybe they're- napping.
Oh! Ohhhhh! Oh! Phoebe, come here. Aw, this is my new bed. You gotta feel this bad boy.
Because they'll know we've been listening.
Rach! We weren't gonna miss our friends getting married!
Sweetie! Edges! Fingers! Smudgey! Pictures!
She's only a couple of months pregnant. She liked our application but who knows if she's gonna like us.
Really?
Chandler?
It's so sweet. It really is. It has this big yard that leads down to this stream and then there's these old maple trees...
Alright, what was this sentence originally?
What?
Oh thanks. Champagne, strawberries...Oh my God! I can't believe Chandler ordered porn on our wedding night!
But I'm gonna be there... for the rest of my life. I mean, I can't break up with him. I'm the one who made him quit drinking. He's dull because of me.
We are not friends with Phoebe anymore.
Yes! Have you seen it?
I-I already told him everything! You shush!!
We're hanging out.
Well, the club lost it's power.
Wow! It's small.
Hi.
You know Paul?
I like that poster!
Uh, so, uh, Rach, uh... do you wanna save this wrapping paper, I mean, it's only a little bit torn... so are you gonna go for it with Ross or should I just throw it out?
Go!!
What about these? These look the same?
Well, they're just gonna have to wait aren't they? I've only got two hands!!
Promise me you'll be careful.
Aaahhhhhhh! Aaahhhh!
And say what? "You owe me a goodbye", I mean, he's got more pride than that.
You-you gotta take it now. Come on, do it as a present to me.
Are you okay?
Gin.
My God, you can't even look at me! Can you?
Is-is-is there a-a Mrs. Stevens?
You started that?!
Come on! So she comes to the wedding! I mean it won't be so bad.
If only there were a smaller one to clean this one!
You wanna what?!
Rachel, you can go down there, you don't have to smoke. Just say you wanna get some fresh air.
Hey, don't blame me for wigging tonight!
The thing we never do.
Wow! For just a week you guys are really close, huh?
Hey! Continuing the countdown of your favorite meals. Tonight, No. 3, macaroni and cheese with cut up hot dogs.
Oh wait, just one more thing! One more minute! Umm, you're a stupid bitch.
Oh, then bring it on! Oh, unless of course your afraid you might lose to a bunch of girls.
Come on Ben.
What?! Are you crazy?! I'm not getting married! I'm not even engaged.
This is Rachel. I mean, what are you gonna do, never going to talk to her again? I mean I know it's weird, it's awkward, but you gotta at least try.
Thank you. Come meet my friends. This is uh, Phoebe.
Well there's some people who do want to marry me.
Honey, we don't really have to go to this thing tonight do we?
Why? What did you do in the bathroom?
You stole them from me!
Like?
You're not gonna be here New Year's Eve??
You're gonna like him so much. So umm, when do you want to meet him?
All right, come on guys, let's go! Tie score, and we're runnin' out of time. Forty-two!! Thirty-eight!! Hike!
Yeah, but I love you more. Besides y'know, nothing goes with Bing. So I'm screwed. I mean... Oh, hi Emma. Yeah, that's you. You're our little Em. Oh what's that honey? What? Oh, you want a little cousin? You want a cousin right now?!
Honey, that's a great idea nailing the boxes to the floor!
What?
It doesn't say that!
Yeah, definitely.
Oh my God, what are you gonna do?!
Oh yeah right!
I-I'm the head chef. I-I can't get promoted.
Thank you so much for seeing us. Phoebe has told us such great things about you guys.
Yeah... Yeah, I know it's pretty selfish, but haha, hey, that's me. Why don't you try the hummus?
I'll be coordinator! Oh my God! I'm so sorry, I didn't get you anything! Okay, look everybody has to help! Okay? You can help, can't you Phoebe?
What, he doesn't like Josh?
I told you you were a bath person! Hey, when you get out, maybe I can give you a facial!
Okay, stop it Phoebe, you're getting me all tingly.
I'm sorry, idea time is over.
Can I ask you just a little question, huh? Why tonight?
So what do you think?
Honey, the question is...do you really want to marry Joey?
Oh.
I know. It's just such reckless spending.
Alright. Just keep him away from me.
He's got something plastic lodged in his throat, we've got to go to the hospital.
How are we gonna get home? Maybe a piggy-back ride?
Oh, I was hoping you wouldn't remember.
I am so jealous.
You bet! No TV or anything!
Yeah well, I ran into Richard.
Hi. Uh, we'll be right there, we're just trying to decide something.
Pete, can I get you something else?
Alright, you see these little flower blossoms? They should be facing up, not down, because, well, the head of the bed is where the sun would be. You don't love me any more do you.
No, no, Rachel?
Yeah! I bet I can do it.
Again. Y'know what? I think we all did.
I don't know sweetie.
Wait! What about Joey?
Oh, y'know what, I can't, it really kills.
Yeah!
It needs to go about 20 blocks to the left!
Is it the Italian guy?
I don't know!
Guys can fake it? Unbelievable. The one thing that's ours! Besides, why would you fake it when we're trying to have a baby?
Hey!
YOU BET YOUR ASS I AM! I just had the best first day ever! The kitchen: twice as big as Allessandro's.
Nope!
You guys, I ordered some chocolate pies from that bakery on Bleecker. Could you pick them up for me?
Oh my god.
I never stop thinking about it.
Keep talking.
Look!
So you talked to your dad, huh.
Nothing, I don't know.
You jerk! You know how much I love that kid!
What do you think?
Boy, you are really not a morning person.
Here, let me make the milk, I'm up anyway.
I can't go to lunch!!
Well, thanks.
I love you!
Why does my cinamon stick have an eraser?
Losers walk!
What? Who says that?
Yeah, definitely!
Who wasn't invited to the wedding.
Sixty guests.
Nope. Schhorry.
You'll vamp?!
Hey, how did it go with Mike, is he gonna let you keep the painting?
If you want.
Joey, please don't do that. I think it's best that we just forget about it.
Chandler, we still haven't gotten an RSVP from your dad.
Yes!
Um, well, I was going to, I-I-I really was. But um, then somewhere, just out of nowhere, I didn't.
Stop it, stop it, stop it!
There are no tickets on the nightstand!
Oh my gosh! Rachel, honey.. are you okay? Where-where's Paolo?
Hey Joey, sweetie, taste this.
Look what I found in the drawer... And you said I'd never wear this...
I'm just saying, if we put just a little bit of makeup on you.
Hey!
Okay, I'm sorry. I think I can walk the rest of the way now. Just-just give me my boots.
Well, we don't really have to decide anything right now, do we?
Hey.
I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! Hi, Tim.
Curry.
Ross, I'm gonna use yours, okay?
What if I have babies, okay? I mean I'm gonna look different. I'm okay with that, but I'm not sure that you are!
What's the matter?
I guess Joey was right, it does nothing.
Wait a minute! We're talking about someone that I'm going out with?
Is your tongue swelling up?
How much longer?
Even Mary Tyler Moore would've been better.
Oh yeah, I remember mine! Ohh, it was my sixth birthday, my dad took me to the park, I got it, and...it bent.
No no no no.
Joey!
On three, 1...2...3! Now my pillow's all wet!
Why not?! I mean this has been the most amazing week. Would it be so terrible? Even if we were friends who lived together. Or, maybe someday friends who stood up in front of their other friends, and vowed to be friends forever.
All right look, if I take Chandler out of the running will you be able to focus?
Okay.
Ok..You know the old classics you know,You look nice? They're still ok.
Phoebe, you're gonna be with your grandma?
Hey.
Well, an-anyway, I just-that night meant a lot to me, I guess I'm just trying to say thanks.
Did you know I was allergic to shellfish?
Hold on a second! What is that on her ankle?
Thirty-two! Seventy-one! Hike!
'Cause you invited your assistant.
Why would someone do that?! ...One might wonder.
Mom says it's all of Manhattan, parts of Brooklyn and Queens, and they have no idea when it's coming back on.
Oh, it's so beautiful. Ohh! Y'know, I-I don't know if I feel right about this.
She looks exactly like Aunt Marilyn.
I-It's just so insulting! Big spring for a new blank tape, Doctor!
Maybe he didn't give you a chance.
Chandler, I don't even wanna see the musical Oklahoma!
Chandler is supposed to find out if he's getting an assistent job at his ad agency. But out of the 15 interns, they are only hiring three.
I'm fine.
Thank you.
Hey Rach!
Oh, it's a great party! Great food. Y'know, most parties it's all chips and salsa, chips and salsa. So umm, what's this?
See? Ben doesn't think you're a loser, he thinks you're a cowboy! Now that's something.
Hey!
This is so typical. Y'know, we give, and we give, and we give. And then- we just get nothing back! And then one day, y'know, it's just, you wake up, and "See you around!" Let's go, Phoebe.
Chandler could you at least send some women to my party? Alright that's Ross.
Why?
Hi Mr....Bing.
Oh, then go Vassar.
Stop it. Stop! Okay let's go. We can be strong.
Oh, it is sooo perfect. Thank you so much.
Really? I don't really feel like it.
I gotta tell ya, I think it's okay to be that guy.
You cried yesterday at the six o'clock news.
We can't afford that.
Hey Frannie, welcome back! How was Florida?
You wanna fool around with Joey?
No.
What are you doing?
Does anybody want these?
Does seem pretty perfect.
Y'know what? You are right?!
Did you smoke?
Okay, I gotta go find Rachel but umm, if you guys see her could you please try to give her some really bad news so that mine doesn't seem so bad?
Oh!
Oh, my fiancee wants the Swing Kings.
Oop, your cake is ready!
What are you barking at?
Yeah, I think we're ready for our first course. OK, um, these are rot-shrimp ravioli, and celantro pondou sauce... ... with just a touch of mints... and... ... ginger.
Oh, it was awful. I guess some people just don't appreciate really good food.
Why? It's not like I'm putting little nipples on them.
Break.
: hey Joey.
So, do you guys wanna come and eat dinner at the restaurant sometime in the next few weeks?
Don't worry. You'll find some place to get married.
Bye.
No, to get a table! Places like are always shakin' you down. Everybody wants to be paid off.
No.
Those are my eyes! Those are my breasts.
Hey.
If I tell you, you'll think I'm crazy.
I-I-I wanna thank you all for coming. My family and my friends...
Yes.
All right, you!
Yeah, you miss alot, when you're moo-ing.
So then, are you going to dump Jason?
What did you just say?
So, Mr. Rastatter, what exactly does this job entail? The ad wasn't too clear.
What are they?
I mean, I-I, I really shouldn't say. I mean, I'm really not supposed to.
Aww, not right now.
Nooo!
Are you okay?
So you wanna tell us now, or are we waiting for four wet bridesmaids?
Ok, well, what kind of ritual?
All right, look, Ross. I realize that you have issues with Carol and Susan, and I feel for you, I do. But if you don't help me cook, I'm gonna take a bunch of those little hot dogs, and I'm gonna create a new appetizer called "pigs in Ross". All right, ball the melon.
Uh, no!!
Ok, it is definitely less than a ballpark.
Hey! Didn't you have that outfit on last night?
Oh my God! Oranges!
Thank you.
Making her a mixed tape?
See if he has ice.
Right.
You're gonna find a place. But even if - God forbid - you didn't.. So you postpone the wedding. Is that really so bad? I mean, think about it. You could take all the time you needed to get everything that you want. You could have tulips, you could have salmon.... Mmmmm... Salmon!!
What? Why, why would...
Ohh, of course we are! We left it up to fate. If we were supposed to get married there would be a clear-cut sign.
Oh yeah that's what you want - my inhibitions lowered.
You do?!
Oh, yeah, that's true.
Oh! They're late and they're sloppy!
Hey guys!
That's it! Take it! Take it! Take it!
Look, I know that I should've told them. I know I shouldn't care what they think. I'm sorry.
You're a pig. And you can't do this.
Y'know what? I-I don't want a big, fancy wedding.
Oh, you mean like that guy thing where you act mean and distant until you get us to break up with you.
I know, I've been looking at those doors, they look pretty sound proof, don't you think?
Yeah, y'know I-I made a commitment to you. Y'know what, it'd be, it'd be fun.
Oh man!
Oh, no thanks, we're just here to observe.
That was you?!
Well, you guys have been friends forever. Remember the first time that you kissed Ross? How weird that was? You couldn't stop laughing? You got through that.
All right! Come on Monica! Look alive! Come on, look alive!
How would I know? I-I wasn't here.
Hey Phoebe! Guess what?
I know, but y'know, this time you're gonna definitely know whether or not you did it!
Oh, we have some...
We're gonna see each other naked.
Because we won our apartment back!
No, you?
No it is not!
Ow!
Is that a secret or a lie.
He wanted to tell me he's gonna compete is some ultimate fighting competition thingy.
We were playing a game.
So then you know?
Oh my God! He's gonna rat me out!
Really well. Yeah. Surprisingly well. Yeah, she didn't cry. She wasn't angry or sad.
Hey, the point is that he was at everyone of your swim meets and he was there cheering you on! Okay? That's a, that's a pretty great dad.
Okay, so I'm responsible, I'm organised. But hey, I can be a kook.
No... Either of you girls got a quarter?
Yeah. Mine too.
What's wrong Phoebe?
It's nice.
Joey's bare ass!
Hey.
That does not mean you know us better, I-I want a rematch.
Never done that before.
Strip Happy Days Game?
I don't know, Chandler. Let's take a look.
If you're not going then I don't want to go either.
I hope you're not full, 'cause dinner's almost ready.
She's not pregnant. It's Rachel. Rachel's the one who's pregnant.
Wait, what about the time I hit you in the face with the Silvian's pumpkin?
All right, we still have a minute and a half to go, and we're down by two points. Two points.... Phoebe you do a button-hook again. Rachel, you go long.
You don't want to know what tonight was.
Oh my God! What happened?
Well, she saw the ring.
Okay, I-I d'know, you-you just- you have a quality.
Not a basset, a bassinet.
So do you guys gonna come over tomorrow? I'll make that pasta thing I was telling you about.
What?
Oh, wait, wait, wait! Here they go again.
And Rachel. And that's Chandler.
Look, I don't wanna do this test either, but I really do think it's a good idea!
Wow! That Mike thing was interesting! I don't know what's gonna happen with Phoebe and David.
That is a slap in the face.
Ahh! Aren't you dressed yet?
So, why don't you just take it back to where you got it?
Okay. Here's the thing.
Get in there man! Flirt back, mix it up!
God, I feel so guilty about Ross.
Oh good, I think so too. Pheebs?
Where have you been?
Tell him that you haven't seen your wife in a long time. Tell him that having a long-distance relationship is really difficult. Tell him that what little time we have is precious.
All right baby, come on! Yes! Yes! I am on fire!
You don't even know me...
Chandler, please! Do you know how unbelievably glad I am that Joey was not there that night?!
All right then. Bye.
It's all everybody at the party could talk about!
Uh well that depends, how are things with Phoebe?
That's not a question.
I just asked you.
Because your all gonna make up fake specials and make me cook them like you did the other night?
No, no really. I.. I wouldn't feel right about it. Just some water.
Sweetie okay. It's okay. Everybody made it to the wedding. I'm fine.
A monkey. Have you seen a monkey?
You too!
There's no man in here. How dare you accuse me of that.
If you have the big apartment you have to deal with people coming over all the time. That fridge has got to be stocked, okay, that's your department now.
You're gonna do some feet flirtin'!
Also both of your sisters called and neither can make it.
Why?
Oh, why?
Yeah, sure.
No I told you I can't.
What?
Are you okay?
Who's David Lynn?
Ten dollars an hour.
What?
Happy birthday!
What are you doing?
I thought it might be true. And I was afraid that you were gonna cry and then show it to me.
What?!
Hi!
Well, the good news is, I don't think anyone's looking at us.
I'm sorry...
I was laughing.
I am not high maintenance!
Well, y'know how I always wanted to go out with Chip Matthews in high school?
They can't all be bad. Find the one where you make your bedroom eyes. Ohh, there it is.
And it's so clean!!
Ah, come on, sneakers are easy. You wear sneakers all the time.
What're you gonna do?
Hello?
Yeah. I'm okay. I'm actually-I'm a little cold, can I have your jacket?
Which we are, and-and we already paid for it. It's My Giant!
All right. The super couldn't figure out what it did. A $200 an hour electrician couldn't figure out what it did. I've had seven pretty serious shocks. I officially give up.
Joey!!
No he went out to get pizza.
Wait a minute, y'know, you're bringing me!
Wow. My brother never even told me when he lost his virginity.
Phoebe!
Thank you.
I'm so sorry that you had to find out this way. I'm sorry, but iit-t's true, I love him too.
What's with all this sand?
You should feel great about yourself! You're doing this amazing independence thing!
What?
Why the hell did you take her?
Then why would he say it?
And well, we probably shouldn't see each other anymore. I'm sorry.
Listen, uh, you told me something that was really difficult for you. And I, I-I figured if you could be honest, then I can to.
The second that Ross walks in that door, I want you take him back to your bedroom and do whatever it is that you do that makes him go, rweee!!
That's true.
And they love me!
Yes Rachel, why do you care so much?
Was he falsely accused of something?
How do you feel?
Yes, I'm sure! Rachel is there something that you want to talk me about?
Hey, you've got a boyfriend!
I am not.
Yay!
Wait a minute! So you told people I was pregnant?! Does this look like a conversation that I want to remember?!
Guys! Guys! I just saw two people having sex in a car right outside.
This is just Bactine. It won't hurt.
Thunder being stolen!!
I think, that if you really like this guy, you should just trust him.
All right. Have you said, "I love you?" You could say, I love you.
It's gonna be ok. Ryan's been under water. He's just gonna be so glad that you don't have barnicles on your butt.
What are you doing?
Oh my God! You don't know me at all!
Well thank God you were here! I mean, we have to erase that!
Oh my Gosh!
Big time!
Yeah, I talked to you on the phone, I'm the lady that got stuck with the racecar bed.
No, I have just to have two more points to beat him!
You actually broke her watch? Wow! The worst thing I ever did was, I-I shredded by boyfriend's favorite bath towel.
It's my new perfume. Why don't you come closer where you can really appreciate it?
Oh.
Will! From high school.
How's the big anniversary dinner?
That's it! Right there! Is all I wanted!
Come in!
It's Richard Burke.
Well, instead of being sad that tonight is my last night together with Rachel we thought we'd go out to dinner and celebrate the fact that Rachel is moving in with Phoebe.
Pheebs, you remember how we talked about saying things quietly to yourself first?
Okay, I'll rest. But y'know if I'm going to bed, then you're coming with me.
Hi, nice to meet you!
Who is it?
Oh my God Stu! I-I can't believe you did this! Now are you absolutely sure she's a hooker?
Well?
Come on Ben.
No, it doesn't, does it? But you wanted lumps, Ross? Well, here you go, buddy, ya got one.
You think we're being obvious?
Oh yeah, she didn't hire me out of pity, it wasn't so she could pick on me in front of her friends, she actually thinks I'm good.
Okay! I will! Mrs. Green? Mrs. Green! It is rude to leave a party without saying good-bye to the host! Yeah, and-and also when someone apologizes to you the decent thing to do is to accept it! Now what I did to you, it wasn't on purpose! But what you're during to me now is just plain spiteful!
But I insist!
What if it's new? I mean, we agreed not to talk again, unless we had something really important to say. Shouldn't I call him back?
It will not be fine. We'll get in trouble.
Yeah.
So you can't lose, it's there in the title. Wonderfullness is baked right in.
Forget the bubblewrap! There isn't time! Rachel starts messing up Amy's hair: Frizzy frizzy frizzy frizzy!!
You said the baby.
I just wanted to say that I hope you do have sex tonight and I hope that you guys get back together, but I must warn you, the night that you announce your engagement I'm going to announce that I'm pregnant!
Oh, gosh, you got some on your shirt.
Thank you.
Bye!
Look, maybe this is none of my business, or maybe it is, I don't know... but, uh, I'm kind of worried about you.
Wow! You are really fast!
Ok, you're being wierd. Do you want sex or did you do something bad?
Wait, he's not here yet.
Okay.
I know. I just can't find...
Joey! He's working! You would look good in that.
Come on Rach, let's go.
No.
And-and-and if I die, from a long illness. And you're writing out my eulogy and you open a desk drawer and you find a note from me that says, "I will always be with you," and you still can't shed one tiny tear, I know you'll be crying a river inside.
Bye... bye... BIRDIE.
No.
Ok, my husband just gave your boyfriend some very bad advice. Look, David is going to propose to you tonight.
Oh god, waddawe do, waddawe do, waddawe do?
Maybe she will. Uh! Why couldn't I have been a Reverend?
That's better. 90 seconds is a long time not to think about it...except all I did was think about it.
Of course not. I mean gosh, Chandler what you did, it's, it's a wonderful thing and I really appreciate it. I know I have this weird thing where I want everything to be in the perfect place, but I'd never expect you to worry about that.
You didn't know that already?
You could do that!
He's in a different room! He's really that loud?
Well, what's the part?
This doesn't feel weird!
What?
Y'know, there's a Starbucks about three blocks down.
Not really.
Hey!
Yes! Every year Ross makes the toast, and it's always really moving, and always makes them cry. Well this year I'm going to make them cry.
It was.
It was Laura... She gave us a great report and we are officially on the waiting list.
No-no-no, that's a video-phone. But hey guys you're not supposed to be here, so please, do not touch anything.
Put it out!!
Well, at least you're not hearing it for the first time at your fifth grade Halloween party.
See, didn't I tell you?! You're getting over Ross already!
It was great! It was great! How about you?! I mean you're having a baby!
Huh?
Hey!
yeah oh my god, I'm so moved.
I don't need an actual man, just a couple of his best swimmers. And there, there are places you can go to get that stuff.
Doing great, the quiches are coming along.
So if everyone liked it, and you liked it, that would make this a success. Which would make you...
Hey! Umm, I think Brenda needs a raise.
I need a few more things to make the margaritas. Uhh, I need some salt, some margarita mix, and tequila.
Oh my God! You're good!
Joey, you have to talk to her!
All right, you're hired!
I didn't take a pregnancy test.
What are you doing here so early?
We're switching rooms.
Thanks. I think you got it!
Ohhhh!
Oh my God! Ohh! Look at this one! It's so beautiful!
That's Dudley Moore. I said I wanted it like Demi Moore.
Why are you reading this? You hate this kind of stuff.
This is so much fun!
The wedding starts at six.
I got you a present!
Do you hear something?
No no, it's not working on me. Wow! I must be growing up!
Why?
Honey, it's not pushy, he gave her his home number.
Hey listen umm, how would you like to get together? Say next Saturday? Okay, how about Sunday? Okay umm, the week after that? The week after that? Y'know what Greg? Y'know what? We are good, interesting, funny people with good questions and if you and your precious Jenny can't see that then... January 15th? We'll see you then! Okay!
Okay..
Oh, please, that is such a lame excuse!
Oh, my mom called, they're gonna run our engagement announcement in the local paper, so we're looking for a good picture of us.
Well, if you don't have anything to copy, why are you going down there?
What is that?
All right, I still need a calamari and a Caesar salad.
It isn't mine!
Do you think breaking up with him was a huge mistake?
Wait a minute, wait a minute. Yes he is. You are totally different.
Again, you're welcome.
Of course.
Yeah! I think that's great!
I can't believe you didn't tell me.
Joey, did you even interview this woman before you asked her to move in?
No I'm not sure that it's the best way to hear everything. Someone get me a glass!
Phoebe!
That was the adoption agency...
It's not like, I haven't any opportunities. I mean, y'know, I'm just waiting for the perfect guy. I'm seeing this guy Roger, all right? He's not perfect, but umm, I think maybe I should just get it over with. Y'know, give him my flower.
Do you know what's a bad idea?
Oh, you must be freezing. You know what you need? How about a nice steaming cup of hot Mockolate?
And you would?
Eww!!
You have to go to London!
Pete's breaking up with me.
Great!
What? Wait! Why? Chandler! Chandler! Wait! I'm sorry, I was just playing for one second! I was trying to find you to tell you that, look if you don't want me to see Richard again, I won't! He means nothing to me!
Ross has never checked out of a room a minute before he had to.
Phoebe, come on, you have to tell us.
Great! Umm, well what-what I was doing in Chandler's room is that umm, I was cleaning it! In fact, he pays me to clean it!
What about your breath?!
Well, what happened?
No!
Maurice.
And what are you laughing at, Miss `My-keg-sucking-boyfriend-is-stealing-from-me!'
He just left.
You bet.
No you can't. She's yours!
What are you talking about?
Well, I was going for wrong, but we can use your word.
Rachel, he like, totally changed time.
In that cute, little, sweet way she just did?
Am not!
I guess, in time.
Wow, Monica! What an amazing opportunity to influence... dozens of people.
I'm so happy for me.
Oh my God, are you out of a job?
Fine! Judge all you want to but, married a lesbian, left a man at the altar, fell in love with a gay ice dancer, threw a girl's wooden leg in a fire, livin' in a box!!
Okay. I suck!
You'll do what?
Yes that would be lovely.
You said that was sexy!
Joe... Emus are birds. You raise them for meat.
We didn't give you any money!
Here's your key
What does he think? Does he think I'm just gonna wait around for nothing?
The wedding is off, sloppy and immature!
No fair. I don't even have one. How come they get two?
But you told them you weren't?
No! No it's not! It's not gonna be okay! It sucks! No swing band! No lilies!
Oh man, they think they are so slick messing with us! But see they don't know that we know that they know! So...
To score the winning touchdown, by the way.
I am loud!
Ready!
How?
Joey. Erica, baby!
We're not doing anything.
Oh, good luck.
He just told me at the counter. He made me promise not to tell, but I couldn't hold it in any longer!
But I figured, you know, that shouldn't change anything. I mean, what the hell does it matter how old we are.
You're supposed to double the tax. Not double the tax of Romania. I mean, what's-what's the deal? Are you, are you trying to buy me? Is this the way you get girls to go out with you?
I was just waiting for the perfect guy.
You still work at the multiplex?
Yeah.
Did she really say that?
Hey, cheer up! You're gonna see her again, right?
I can't believe mom and dad are selling the house!
Uh-huh.
Yeah, what is it?
Why would you do that?
What's the matter?
Y'know, maybe it's best that we never got to do it again.
No, sorry sweety..
There's nothing to tell! He's just some guy I work with!
I know.
His indian name?
Rach, did you check the machine?
Hey.
Tell them I'm a chef in a big New York restaurant!
She was like 30, dark hair, attractive.
Yeah but see I have nothing to compare it too. So even if you're horrible, how would I know?
Hey! Maybe the monkey will be at the audition!
You know what. Tomorrow I'm gonna do your clocks.
How are you?
I am, aren't I?
Okay!
Janice?!
I was the pile of coats!
Hey, Joey, could you pass the cheese?
Chandler look, I don't want to be one of those wives who says, "You can't go to the game. You have to spend time with me." So, if you could just realize it on your own . . .
OK LET'S GET THESE CHAIRS OUT HERE! Gunther, hit the Christmas lights. Okay, who left the ice sculpture ON THE STEAM GRATE?
Eh, we weren't that close anyway!
Okay, one more, please. Come on, I'm gonna get it in this time, I will.
What?! You slept with Jason?
Oh my God!
Hmhmm.
Well no, but um.
You broke up with a girl because she was fat?!
I wish we at least knew his name... Look at that face. I mean, even sleeping, he looks smart. I bet he's a lawyer.
Okay, wait, you gotta hang up 'cause we're gonna be late.
Oh my God! Oh, this is incredible! Ohh! All right, y'know what? I'm just gonna roll right into that office and-and quit!
What the hell are you doing?!
Wow!
Okay!
Yes!
I never knew that either.
Uhm, we just wanna give you a heads-up. Bill and Colleen hate us.
His dancing partner?!
You said your boss wants to buy your baby?!
So, wait, you really did like my cookies?
So, should I call him back?
Yeah.
Do you think he knew I was here?
Okay, let's do it. Mom and Dad are gonna be so faced!
I-I-I'm sorry, your-your mouth was full, I didn't hear what you said. Umm, hats off to who now?
Yeah!
Have you seen Rachel? Or a mirror?
Yeah, can we go call them? Is it too soon to call? I wanna call.
Ooh, chocolates on the pillows! I love that!
Ohh! Umm, Phoebe, I kinda need to talk to you about that. Umm, well I-I-I think it might be time for me to take a step back from catering.
Well, Ross was mugged as a kid.
That's okay, this is more important than fruit on my ceiling! You broke up?!
Hey.
Hard 8?! We should call it easy 8!
That's a great idea! I was saving them for something special.
Chandler, sense the tone!!
No.
Okay. Okay, I can't wait! This is going to be the best Valentine's Day ever! I can't believe it! Make the presents! Make the presents!
Ok, let's see... uhm, okay, the turkey is in the oven, the stuffing is ready...
Not never. I mean, I'm gonna see him tomorrow at my eye appointment.
Y'know what? I'll think you'll play.
If you really want to watch that Serengetti thing, you can.
Harder than it sounds. Isn't it?
"Take me to the mansion in the sky-y". I am sorry, the song is over. Did you see me out there?
Hey Rach, aren't these candlesticks mine?
Oh-oh, my God!
Oh Joey, look, we know you're having a hard time with this, but we really, we love it here.
Enjoy!
Nobody move! Okay, you look that way; I'll look this way!
Uh, so anyway, we thought one of you could read something during the ceremony.
I don't know, I lost it all ok. I lost it.
Everybody get your toys!
Okay, maybe people give out fake numbers, but they don't give out fake names.
Are you really gonna do this?
Richard's living room, drinking wine.
Have you even had a girl up here?
Okay, so how do I make him think I wanna have sex with him?
Ah, yeaaah!
This is harder than I thought it would be.
Umm, excuse me, we switched apartments. You can't eat are food anymore, that-that gravy train had ended.
It's enough for wedding scenario eight.
Hey.
Well, I'm gonna fill in for him as food critic for the Chelsea Reporter.
Y'know, it is so strange seeing Ross here this time of day, 'cause usually he's got the children's hospital.
You can't marry him!
Hey guys!
Oh yeah...So how did you end up kissing?
Twenty bucks says they're married within the month.
Nononononono. Think who you're dealing with here. I mean, I'm not like you. I-I can't even stand in front of a tap class.
Whatever Ross! Just replace the bulbs in the brake lights after you're done.
...I can imagine.
Well it's...I mean I'd just-I'd be self-conscious. You're my friend; I'd be naked.
Alright, 5 more minutes.
Yes but my mom got me this job.
What is it?
Ohh, you are such a good boss! Is she pretty?
All right. Umm, you could uh start out with a little 1, a 2, a 1-2-3, 3, 5, a 4, a 3-2, 2, a 2-4-6, 2-4-6, 4, 2, 2, 4-7, 5-7, 6-7, 7 ...7.....7...7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7...!
Why?
Come in! Come in! We're engaged!!!
Alright, Cincinnati, no blinds, everybody ante.
Do you have a plan?
Well yeah.
Hey.
Uh-oh! Uh-oh!
Too strong for me?
We have to do this. We are playing for women everywhere. Okay, just think about every lousy date that you ever had, okay, every guy who kept on the TV while you're making out...
I need to borrow a hundred bucks.
No.
All right. We're gonna go. It's not for another six hours. We're gonna go then.
What?!?!
Okay, fine. Let's talk about snow. -- Do you think it's snowing in Tulsa, where my husband is having sex on a copying machine?
Oh, we weren't talking about you. No, no way to recover.
You wanted it to be a surprise.
Well umm, we were just talking about the y'know, the Swing Kings and just wondering whether y'know, they were the right way to go.
Ugh, I thought you were Rachel!
You know what? You can have mine.
Oh my God. Phoebe. Don't look now, but behind us is a guy who has the potential to break our hearts and plunge us into a pit of depression.
Okay, you come up with an idea.
Really, is he a swimmer?
This doesn't feel weird!
I can't believe Phoebe's gonna have her babies!
I guess I wanted to keep it as a souvenir.
I think he is fine! It's just that we don't know anything real about him... we should get more information.
This is crazy! I mean, it's such a stupid argument. I don't even wanna see Richard again.
Chandler.
Yes smokie, that is what it was. I just can't get enough.
Thank you. All right, now who else do you want to invite?
Well, we could start trying. Now.
Chandler, nobody likes breaking up with someone. You just gotta do it.
Oh, no. He doesn't have time for that. But if you want, you can go help him and Joey pack up the guest room.
How about receiving?
So I did tell you. Okay, y'know, that really isn't the thing. Umm, the thing is that, right now I'm just in a place in my life where I need to focus on me. Y'know what I mean?
Oh, damn it!
Uh Tim? This is Phoebe. Phoebe this is Tim, my new sous chef.
You wanna meet some people? This is uh; this is my husband Chandler. Chandler, this is Will.
Ugh, they sent me home. They said I can't work if I'm sick.
What?!
Well,fall out of it. You know, you shouldn't even be here, it's a school night. Oh god, oh god. I'm like those women that you see with shiny guys named Chad. I'm Joan Collins.
Nothing. I'm gonna take a shower.
But the minute we start to lie to each other... And by 'we' I mean society.
Yes, they can stay with us.
I've gotta tell you, Bob is terrific.
No, although now that's what I'm thinking.
It's Chandler! Are you OK?
Oh God.
You and me both.
All right everybody, this turkey is ready!
Do you think they recognize each other from in there?
Because there are so many terrible sights in this world.
Oh my God!
I'm sorry, but that's my happy place.
I don't know, I've never had to use the other one. I'm just saying y'know, if we're having sex, he's not gonna be talking.
I'll help you fix your sweater.
She doesn't have a stomach ache, she's in labor.
Oh that's a great idea. You're really good on the phone.
Okay!
Yeah!
Okay, looks like Ross and I are captains. Okay, so um, I bunnied first so that means I get to pick first. Joey.
That's okay.
Yes! Now, they're a little more than I normally spend on boots...or rent
What are you trying on now?
I hadn't! Photo 152 was a prototype.
What?! Which one?!
I'm not crying about that! I'm crying about something that happened at work.
It's almost our anniversary!
Hey, I know I what I want!
Oh no, two days, you must be bummed.
Honey! Dinner's ready!
Oh, sure it does! In high school, you weren't jealous at all even though all your girlfriends were cheating on you!
Oh, dear god!
Because! She's my cousin. I mean, we grew up together! We're family y'know? Well that's important to me.
Uh Phoebe?
Honey, having a heart attack is nature's way of telling you to slow it down.
All right, all right, at least I'm prepared.
Y'know in a weird way, you have too much power. Look, you're gonna have to help me out here, 'cause I only have three.
No, of course not. It's not even an issue. Cause I told him I was 22.
Well, maybe you don't need them.
Haven't you and I covered that topic?
Yeah, well I don't think it really counts if you have to read them off the back of your hand after you fall asleep on the couch.
You're kidding! Where? Where?
Oh, the way you crushed Mike at ping pong was such a turn-on.You wanna...?
Ross, you did not come up with "got milk?"
Ross, are you okay?
Best out of three?
Yes it has! I made cookies!
Y'know what? It really creeps me out choosing other people's sex clothes.
Ross, come sign this birthday card for dad. Rich is gonna be here any minute.
Be that as it may, d'you think you could just help us out here on that monkey thing? Y'know, just for old times' sake? Go Bobcats?
Why do you want to see my hand?
What?! There's only been like four kids.
Oh my God, it was the best funeral ever! I mean, everyone loved the food, and guess what? I even got another funeral for tomorrow-the dead-guy-from-today's best friend. I mean, it is like I am the official caterer for that accident!
Outside.
G'bye, Nana.
Then I won't have to kill you.
It's like two miles!
So to get this part you can't be?
Okay, okay... Chandler you... you stop it!
Jeffery.
Besides, it takes the focus off the hat.
Really you can do that?
: Oh well this is the only one they had at our video store, but they did have something called crocodile killers. Or does it always have to be sharks?
"Marriage. It's not for everybody."
Joey!
Oh really?!
Oh wait, wait, unless you happened to catch the Reruns' production of Pinocchio, at the little theater in the park.
Okay. Phoebe that's it. Come on, get out-out of the chair. Get out! Oh come...Phoebe!
Don't do what?
No! You have lasagnas!
Got me.
Have you ever taken out the trash?
Oh my God!
Does it involve clogs?
Um-hmm.
She's mine!
That's all right.
I've been doing a lot of thinking. A lot! And umm, well, I came up with a whole bunch of businesses you can do with your van. Okay umm, you could be flower delivery person.
Wait, no-no-no, I can go really fast! Dad, give me the keys to your Porsche!
Sperm.
Oh, will you do the top of the cabinets? That'll really work up your appetite for lunch.
So, what are you saying now?
Yes! Why, did you-you forget to make yours?
We're okay. I'm still ovulating.
I wanna watch Entertainment Tonight.
What do you think brought than on?
That's Paul's watch. You just put it back where you found it. Oh boy. Alright. Goodnight, everybody.
Come on eight.
I hear wedding bells.
Okay, just so you know, I'm gonna be ovulating from tomorrow until the sixth, so don't touch yourself in the next 48 hours.
Yes, I want to change. And why-why don't you go down and get us a table?
Wait, wait, wait!
Do you mind telling us what it is?
The fake kind!
Are we playing football or what? Come on you hairy-backed Marries.
I thought you hated him?
Chandler?
Oh, I'm glad. Listen, I want to apologize about Chandler, though. I just did not see this coming.
Yes!
I hope you're hungry, we're starting with oysters. And y'know what they say about oysters, don't you?
What's that?
One two three.
GET OUT YOU DUFUS!!
I will.
Oh my God! Where the hell have you been?!!
Something wrong?
Oh my God!
Is this the video of the baby being born? Sweetie, this is Phoebe's. Why were you even watching it?
Thanks.
That'll work!
Who's that?
Wait wait wait. I was at home the whole time. How did I missed that?
What's up?
What did you say?
Oh, yeah.
Hey Joey! Isn't that the girl that waved at you the other day?
I think you look fine.
Of course not nothing is. Between me and you...
Umm, actually I was about to tell you that I was, I was going to get out of it, but hey, if we're just goofing around then uh, maybe I will go out with him.
Okay.
Do I know you?
Listen umm, I've been thinking, it's not fair for me to ask you to spend all of your money on our wedding. I mean, you work, you work really hard for that.
Oh, But you're finally doing something that you love! I can't ask you to give that up. Though it'd be nice if the thing that you love was y'know... finding gold.
And I suppose you used a ring designer for that.
Well, bye for me too.
I've never loved anybody as much as I love you.
No, it's not bad. It's not bad at all. It's-it's really nice.
Ross , foot on the floor or come over no more!
Chandler, where are your tools?
Oh my god.
Did you ever feel like sometimes you are just so unbelievably uncoordinated?
You bought a boat?
Okay, I will. Remember that thing that we just discussed that you wanted to do?
No.
How does she do that?
Oh my God Rach. Bean bag chairs.
Oh, friends first, drunk in London, you know the story. I've got a better question for you: Do you or any of your blood relatives have diabetes?
: Yes! Chandler Watches Shark Porn!
All right, be my guest.
Ross this is the only thing left that has a shot at working.
She said that?!
Why is it sick?
Why?
Ohh, wow! That's great! Oh wow! We really have to start planning! I have, I have a lot of really specific ideas! We should probably get together like four times per week. You can come over to my place; we'll get together before work! What do you say, 6:30, my place? I'm so excited!
Dad, Chandler was just laughing at your joke.
I couldn't eat it! I had five friends who couldn't eat it, and one of them eats books.
Y'know I used to go out with this guy that was a really light sleeper, and whenever I started to snore, he would just roll me over...
This is so great! And I'm gonna be your baby's aunt!
Great! We're hangin' in the kitchen! Let's stay in the kitchen!
What about your massage client?
That'll work!
Yeah, thanks. You know what?
That's insurance fraud.
Not any more.
I'm not laughing.
Chandler's making his sex face.
Uh, Rach, it's the Visa card people.
Clogs.
Wafer thin ice!
Especially the after taste, you know, I'll tell ya, that'll last ya till Christmas.
No. I don't think that you and I were destined to end up together. I think that we fell in love and work hard at our relationship. Some days we work really hard.
Well, what do you think of Mike and Chandler being in a car accident?
You call eight hours alone with my label maker wasted time? Ooh, now I get to use my shredder!
Cache? Jaunty?
Oh my God. She's gonna pick us!
Oh really, you want to talk about quality? Have you heard of a key? It's what some people sing in.
Well, sure, what with it being her funeral and all.
No Mom, I don't have a restaurant, I work in a restaurant.
And six others.
Yes you did! You did like a little hop.
You were my first kiss ever?
Dad, I'm the twinkie.
I gotta go to work. Has anybody seen my left boob?
Deep Impact was the one with Robert Duval, Armageddon is what's going to happen to you if you wake me up.
Oh-oh, no no don't worry, I'm gonna wash it.
Right! .. but we "know" what you're wishing for!
Hello! Organic substances recently discovered in the depths of the rain forest!
Yeah but I'm not keeping it.
Maybe I can try at intermission? Phoebe, come on... you know what? Let's just go!
But ehm...what is it not?
I didn't think you could keep it a secret.
All right everybody! Everybody guess what? I just convinced Paul to give us a test next week!
Okay, everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor. This is everybody, this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my brother Ross?
Guys, we bought the tickets.
Ya know, my party is fun. I mean, maybe it's a little quieter, less obvious sorta fun but, you know, if people would just give it a chance...
Yeah!
Joey!!
Hey, you touch that and you will be sorry.
Hold it! Are you talking about Dick Clark's New Year's Rocking Eve?
Is it me? Is it like I have some sort of beacon that only dogs and men with severe emotional problems can hear?
Thanks, that would be great. Hey, honey, wouldn't that be great?
Ohh, she's looking down the hall. Oh! She looked right at me! Oh wait, you can't see people through that little hole, can you? Hello!
What are you doing?
Hi.
It's for their own good.
Oh, thank you! What's going on?
Hey Rach, the tampons here are only a penny. Let's stock up.
Oh God...
Oh, and by the way, he's lost a bunch of weight. I mean he looks goo-ood! Okay, I mean really, really gorgeous! I still love Chandler.
Honey, you made the bed again. I told you, you don't have to do that. This isn't camp.
Rach, wait, I can cancel...
No-no-no, don't-don't do the accent. You've got to see her again.
I don't see him. Hey! Maybe he's in the sugar bowl! Joey? Nope!
Adoption.
About what?
Yeah, come on, eat, whatever you want. Dr. Roger got beeped again.
Ohhh, ooohhh... you are on a roll, mister!
Subtle guys!
Okay, try it.
Great...
Oh please! Dad turned my room into a gym 20 minutes after I moved out! I gotta say, a tanning bed and a stack of Victoria's Secret catalogues, not a gym!
Haha!
Yeah! Roses or Lilies?
They love my candy? Oh man!!! I've gotta go make more!!
Joey... we always know what you mean.
Well, I'd like to but, I'm not sure we have time to go.
Well, I just caught the live show.
Yeah?
I see pizza!
Ross let me ask you a question. All jokes aside, where is this relationship going?
Yeah!
Are you still crying about your damn baby? Pheebs, you gotta keep the line moving, remember, 20 seconds per person. Your see these clowns all the time!
That you're a liar.
I didn't change!
I got it.
Hi.
Y'know what, I think we should play a game. I mean come on, it's been twelve years.
Ohhh, nice.
Oh! Let's see, well...if this is the wedding hall then umm you're parents will be at home in Queens.
Oh, and you know who's selling a great apartment? Richard!
Oh, then it must've been you. Bye.
My god, if I had a nickel for every guy I wish I hadn't..., but this is about your horrible mistake.
Oh umm, how about your mom dying, or having to live on the streets when you were 14?
Hi!
Hey!
Do you want our guy to be your guy?
No, I-I haven't seen your pink shirt.
Phoebe?
Okay, I got my note cards. Do you got the presents?
Well, actually, I'm already seeing someone.
Am I doing here? Why? Surprised to see me? Ross brought me. How do you like that?!
Yeah.
So your first whole weekend without Ben, what're you guys gonna do?
So, I'm, I'm probably still ovulating. Do you want to give it another try?
Oh she misunderstood, she thought she was moving to Tulsa.
I can't do it!
I don't think this number's right!
I've got a plan. I've got a plan. I'm going to ram this platter really hard into your ribs. You're gonna scream out and that'll wake her up!
One!
Okay, okay. You two go get the dessert. And I'll let you in.
I'm gonna go put my make up on, we have to be at the hotel in an hour!
Wow.
Okay.
'Fraid so. Brown hair, green eyes...
Excuse me, umm, can I talk to you over here for just a second?
Oh and you know what I want!
Okay.
Yeah, Chandler... you've been there for five years.
Did he give you that whole "You're-not-up-to-this" thing again?
All right.
What about the second minister we meet with? I kinda liked him.
That's my old dog. He passed away years ago.
You're mother killed herself!
Yes.
All right, Rachel, I know-I know you think I'm crazy, please, before you tell him you love him, just-just try to find one person who thinks this is a good idea. Because I bet you, you can't.
Phoebe, it's been two days.
Oh. Well, I didn't realize that you needed it back right away. I mean, you told me to go and be a caterer. So I went. I beed. I mean, I... I used it to buy all this stuff. But look-I've got another job tomorrow, so I'll pay you back with the money I make from that.
And it could be soon. I mean, think about it: right now, somewhere out there our baby could be being conceived.
Yeah, come on, we can be guys!
You what?
I...I have to fire him.
I need more swordfish. Can you get me some more swordfish?
Careful. Careful. CAREFUL! Sorry.
Oh how nice. Maybe later we can all go blow our noses on my wedding dress. Ross comes out of the guest bedroom with the diaper bag and the car seat carrying thingy.. yeah.. thats the techinal term.. He goes to Chandler.
Look at you, you won't even look at him.
Oh, I wish there was a job where I could wear this all the time. Maybe someday, there will be.
How dirty do you think I am? I'm telling you, if you had some candles and some bubbles and some music, you would love it! It would take all of your stress away.
I thought I was something that we both wanted!
What if they don't?
Do you really think marrying someone else is the right answer?
Yes!! Yes! Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Really?
First, I need a boyfriend, then I can have a list.
Well you should be embarrassed.
Oh, no! I mean, obviously we want to see you take your clothes off! You big piece of eye candy!
Then you'd be going back and forth all the time, I mean it doesn't make any sense.
No, it's okay, not only did I get to go out with Chip Matthews, I got to dump Chip Matthews.
Oooh, I wish she could stay here, but Chandler is allergic!
Phoebe, what, what happened here?!
Uh, Rach... how come you have dental floss in your hair?
Uh, Ross.
Yeah, I've just been fiddling around in here making delicious treats for everyone.
Oh, gosh, this is so weird. I mean, his whole life was in this apartment, and now it's gone. You know, I think it would be nice if we just took a few moments, for Mr. Heckles. I mean, he was kind of a pain, he was, but, he was a person. You're all going to hell.
Chandler, wh-why don't we sit down?
You went to one where you were popular, and you got to ride off Chip's motorcycle, and wear his letterman jacket. I went to one where I wore a band uniform they had to have specially made.
Now we just have to wait for a call and... and someone tells us there's a baby waiting for us. Oh...
Phoebe, relax none of that stuff ever happens! They just put it on there for legal reasons!
Rachel! I'm never gonna think it's okay for you to cheat on your husband!
And Mindy, your maid of...?
Phoebe, she sounded pretty upset to me.
Okay. Four.
What are you guys doing here?
Come on...I just need it for some rent and..and some other bills.
Nobody wants to do it? All right, I'll do it myself.
Ok, trying to turn me on by making a mess? Know your audience! Besides, tomorrow we're doing those fertility tests and until then you need to keep your tadpoles in the tank.
Rachel, it's a world where Joey is a neuro-surgeon.
Well forget it! It doesn't hurt that baaad!!!!
Okay that does sound like fun.
It's not gonna happen. They're doing it tonight, we can do it tomorrow.
We are there!
They're still in my coat.
Oh Joey!
The park huh? A public place.
Oh y'know what? If you're gonna be acting like this all night, I really, I don't even want to be around you.
Ross, just forget about it. This guy's got you totally wedged in.
You're fired!
Haha!
: Hi, how was your flight?
So what's Phoebe like?
Remember that guy from cooking school I told you about that put cilantro with everything?
When two people finally realise their feelings for each other, and-and they talk for hours, and they-they learn all about the other person!
Oh good God! If you want a baby so bad just go steal it!
Oh, wait, is he the guy I met at Christmas?
Come here! Come here! Sweetie you don't have to worry. No, besides y'know what? I'm gonna have a lot of new things with you. The first time we buy a house. Our first kid. Our first grandkid...
Uhm the... the ministry... of names... bureau...
Look umm, of all people, you do not want me to tell this story!
Oh come on! You're making it sound worse than it actually was.
This bottle opener.
Jacket now.
Are you kidding?! I practically spent my entire childhood at the arcade! This is like-Oh my, this is like my second favorite game!
Ok, then just go.
Hi.
Just uh, do the right thing.
Yeah! Yeah! His name is Chandler and...
Yes. Well I got his machine and I left a message. But it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, because you know it was like a casual, breezy message. It was breezy! Oh God, what if it wasn't breezy?
Oh that's sweet. Don't touch me.
It was, it was really nice. We started talking and I-I ended up having lunch with him.
Okay, I was thinking we should have a beautiful guest room, right? With a mahogany sleigh bed and bedside tables with flowers on them all the time! And we could have a roll top desk with comment cards on them so people could say how much they loved staying here!! Okay, whatever, I really haven't thought about it that much.
dammit!
Thank you. They're yours.
I don't know. I mean, I guess having sex in front of a baby isn't so...
We should go.
Well uh, I'm trying to make something for Joey. Do you mind if I raid your fridge?
Okay, but all right you're a guy, does it not freak you that you're never gonna sleep with anybody else?
Hey, it's Phoebe and Rachel. Um, why don't you tell them what you were telling me earlier about me not being high maintenance?
I warned you...
So glad you came!
Hey. There you are. You disappeared after dinner.
Thank you.
Okay. Sorry.
Does anybody wanna split this with me?
Was he wearing a stunning blue suit?
Well that's because you always sleep to noon, silly! This is what 9 looks like.
Not just the phone pen. I never get my messages.
Ah, yeah!
Chandler, we have talked about this. You are not supposed to give people advice! Now couldn't you just have made some sort of inappropriate joke?
We'd love too.
You're just new at this, it'll get better, think about your first day at work. I mean, that couldn't have been easy but you figured that out.
Sweetie, we heard you crying. Please don't cry.
Oh, no!
She's a hooker! She's a hooker! She's a... Hi! Uh, we spoke on the phone.
Are you kidding? This is where they get out stains! Okay? This is like Disneyland for me. I'm-I'm gonna be over here watching the dance of the clean shirts.
Well actually, I-I didn't eat mine. It's still in the bathroom.
You wanna get out of my face?
She sent the chicken back again?!
Hey! Happy Anniversary!
Honey, if you know it through a wall, you know it too well!
All right, so I haven't cleared the budget with my parents yet, but tell me how this is for music.
Hello.
Two!
A positive atmosphere! But I-I-I have had it up to here. From now on, it is gonna be my way, or the highway! All right? Does anybody have a problem with that?!! Hey new guy! I said, does anybody have a problem with that?!
Hey!
What is with you?
Umm, I think I spoke too quickly. There-there's a learning curve with this job and maybe we can try it again.
Yeah?
Phoebe, do you think that your favorite animal says much about you?
Hi!
That's great.
Joey?
Ok, Mike, enough is enough, now you love Phoebe and she loves you, so you need to get over your whole "I never want to get married" thing and step up!
What?
Joey, please come. It would mean so much to us.
Well...honestly ever since we got engaged I have been waiting for something to, to flip you out.
Hey!
Phoebe, don't worry about it. I'm sure she wants to live with you.
It was Michelle. It was definitely Michelle.
Oh my God! Well push it in! Push it in!
Ha! My point!
Oh, okay!
Take me home!
Chandler gets pedicures!
Really?
Now, are you glad we didn't start with the bikini strips?
Rachel! Rachel! You haven't touched Eldad's hair!
Hey Rach, could you get me some cough drops?
Yeah?
What?
I wasn't escaping.
Ready? Wrestle!
Okay. Umm...
It might be kinda cool.
Oh, look at these little bunnies!
Oh my god, where's Emma? Where's Emma?
Oh, I'm sorry.
All right, watch!
I was in too much pain.
The guy who made these hates feet and wants to see them die!
Alright, well I'm tearing the lettuce.
I'll take care of it.
No! Rachel, you didn't find anyone so you can't tell him.
Yes, thank you so much. And again, we're so sorry. We could not feel worse about it.
Joey.
Can we turn the TV off? Okay? Do we really want to spend the entire weekend like this?
So it's okay to date a student.
Okay.
Well, tonight was-was going to be my first time.
Absolutely! It would just be one friend helping out another friend.
Well, given that we forgot to invite her it would be an awfully big coincidence if she was.
Well, if you're gonna be totally rational about this, I can't argue with you! All right? Fine, if you wanna tell him, tell him. I just don't want to be a part of it.
Joey that is horriable.
I have no idea.
So the going for help went well?
Something went wrong with Underdog, and they couldn't get his head to inflate. So anyway, um, his head is like flopping down Broadway, right, and I'm just thinking... how inappropriate this is. Um, I've got something in my eye, uh, Joey, could we check it in the light, please?
This is it. Yeah, this is the one. I can't believe I found it!
You'd better hope I don't see you in the hallway!!
Chicken Soup for the Soul?
Can I adopt you?
It's good to see you too.
Oooh! They are in for a world of pain!
All right! You and me! Let's go! Right now!
Chandler, you have to tell Joey that you're not in Tulsa.
I mean don't you trust her?
What? You freak! You wouldn't even have known about this place if it wasn't for me!
The three of us?
It's my New Year's resolution!
That would be a good idea.
That's not totally true.
Hey!
Hi, Dad, what are you doing here?
Okay! But you can't rip it. Well, maybe a little.
Umm, listen I am sorry, but I'll put some out first thing in the morning.
This is so huge.
Hey, guys, what-what should I wear to a Knicks game?
That could be a four or a five. It's your call.
Okay, if you need the vacuum, it's in my closet on the left-hand side. Ah, the garbage bags are next to the refrigerator...
There's our star!
Third door on the left.
No really, they're OK.
Oh-ho! But not in here! Can't eat 'em in bed, remember? No crumbies!
Are you serious?
Of course it was! Trust me, when it comes to psychology I know what I'm talking about. I took two psych classes in college.
You did? What was he talking about?
Oh my God, he's gonna do it now. Please, I cannot watch this, let's go.
So-so you would've just lied?
Okay! Okay! We can take a hint! What are you doing here?!
Not at these prices.
It will be my pleasure. My guy has diplomatic coupons. Your guy can't even say coupons.
Wait, did you know it was twins?
I think we are getting a little ahead of selves here. Okay. Okay. I am just going to get up, go to work and not think about him all day. Or else I'm just gonna get up and go to work.
Another good point.
Rach, why won't they take it back?
Joey, what's it like on a movie set, huh? Do you have a dressing room? Do you have a chair with your name on it?
Oh no! What's the matter?
Phoebe?
What?
If we wanna get on camera, I think we have to get up on one of those platforms. They've been taping those people up there all day.
Well, apparently she does.
No! Chandler and I are moving in together!
I can't believe you guys are actually getting tattoos.
Joey, this is you!
That's what you say about porn.
Ahhh!
Hey, you got me, put it in.
Rachel! You okay?
So'd you guys have fun?
I know what you need, you need a bodyguard. Hey Ross, what is Ben doing after preschool?
So, what have you guys been doing?
No, actually, we're buying the house next door.
No, we're not! We're not leaving!
Ross, he's got the remote again.
Can you believe it? I finally get to run my own kitchen!
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I-I should probably leave you girls alone.
Well, I guess now we can't go.
Rachel, say that I'm friends with her, we spend some time together. Is that so terrible?
Did you ever go out with a guy your friends all really like?
Ohhh! No! This is my friend Rachel, we went to High School together.
No-no! Don't do it! Don't!
Oh my God!
Hey!
That you can have.
Well he is! Yeah, I mean marriage is all he talks about! My goodness, in fact, I'm the one that's making him wait!
Honey, uh, this is a picture of the frame guy posing in front of a bright blue screen with a collie.
That's right.
Yes!!
Yes, I would like something. No, no thank you.
Eh, you work for that.
No, I'll do it. You just stick to your job.
BECAUSE OF OUR MEDDLING! Alright?
We need to talk to you about something.
As a thank you, Rachel and I will kiss for one minute.
Oh no! Did you take my bra too?!
Umm, listen there's something I think you should know.
Well, I-I-there was this guy at the bank that I thought was cute umm, but I don't anymore.
Hey sweetie. Oh good.
That's also like the tenth time you told us.
But no. Maybe if I were baking.
Yes I am!!
Oh I can't. Dr. Roger is coming over again.
I do, but Rachel borrowed them.
Great. So the ball is in his court?
Relieved?
Alright, we're gonna have to unscrew the chain.
It's.. It's just so pretty and white.
Why is this car in my bedroom?
Absolutely.
Oh, why is it unfair?
Rose Marie really belongs on a smaller screen, doesn't she?
Hey, we're probably fertile, let's go home!
OK.
You guys haven't gotten your presents yet? Tomorrow's Christmas Eve, what're ya gonna do?
Okay-okay, I got it. I got it.
Oh my God, that place has the creamiest frosting! I use to hitchhike there when I was a kid.
Boy, do I have a surprise for you!
I am scrappy.
But you live here! You know that.
Hello? No, he's not here. Yeah, this is his wife. Yeah, well, it came as quite a shock to me too. I guess I should have known. Yeah, I mean, he just kept making me watch Moulin Rouge.
Oh my God!
It's only you.
I'm so humiliated!
Phoebe, you have to lift it and point.
So I don't have to sing and I can just sit there and pass judgments on others?
So I got it when I was 13...
Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't do this.
W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-...
Yes.
Where were you? We were supposed to meet in the wine cellar?
Oh good God, Ross! How the hell do you do it?
Rach, that's great! It's so good that you had a good time in Greece!
My boyfriend said he didn't like my massages.
You okay?
My stock, MEG, it went up 2 points. Hey guys, do you realize that if I had invested my $127 in myself yesterday that I'd like have...a lot more than that today. Ya know what, I'm gonna do it.
I swear I've seen birds do this on Wild Kingdom.
You go back out there and you seduce her till she cracks!
Hey Joey!
What's going on?
Uh-huh, that one!
Well umm, Chandler and I are moving in together.
Okay it's time for the toast! Umm now-now, I know that Ross usually gives the toast, but this year I'm going to do it.
It's gonna be really scary. I mean, god. When we have a baby, there's gonna be so much that we're not able to control. I mean, the apartment's gonna be a mess, I won't have time to clean it. What if the baby gets into the ribbon drawer? Messes up all the ribbons?! What if there's no room for a ribbon drawer, because the baby's stuff takes up all the space!? Where will all the ribbons go!?!
Uh-huh, what exactly did you ask her?
That didn't work on mom, it's not going to work on us.
All right, he's keys are in the drawer. Y'know what? I also need some cash.
Well... Well, great.
Hey!
He is right, isn't he?
What?
Hey, did you get the turkey basted-Oh my God! Oh my God! Who is that?
Phoebe! But I could take one of those little feet and put it in a pita pocket.
I know. How could we have let this happen?
That was gonna be my opener.
Ross, don't start.
Why isn't it working out?
Dad! There's Ross , why don't you go talk to him?
When I fall asleep on the couch after reading, she covers me over with a blanket.
That was a half an hour?
Oh, I love museums!
Wow! Play that message for Emily and this whole problem goes away!
Do you really see this as a long-term thing?
Hi Amanda! Actually now... it's... is not a good time. Dinner tomorrow night? Ok, Phoebe and I will see you then!
Chandler? Can you give me a hand?
Oh, is it that pinball machine with the big bow on it?
: sweetie it's ok, I still love you, let me be a part of this.
Yeah.
Joey, what are you gonna do when you have a baby?
Okay, I'll be back in just a minute. Oh, Phoebe I'm sorry that I left lipstick marks on the phone.
We'll talk later.
I can't leave it! You gouged a hole in my dingy floor.
Come on, that was back in high school! How could that still bother you?
Oh.
You made pancakes?
Who did we fight in World War I?
So uh, Joey and Chanlder, I, I think it's time that you take Dr. Greene over to your place.
God bless you Chandler Bing!
Yes.
Not that, this, US. Oh my God, Ross, you-re, you're, it's jus-, you-, ever sin- you been here.
You know what? This has been kind of a girlie day. You're right, I'm sorry.
Where is everybody? They're forty-five minutes late!
No?
No I don't know Chandler! Not anymore! It's like it's like something's changed.
Listen...I need to know that what I'm about to ask you, will never get back to Chandler.
Paul!
Alright, who wants to do it?
Ross, is he gonna live with you, like, in your apartment?
Oh, my pleasure.
No.
Thanks.
Why?
Oh my God! Have you lost your mind?
Uh-hmm.
Oh, well don't take it to the same place you took the stereo, 'cause they've had that thing for over a week.
Oh now that-that-that's funny, it seems like Chandler's conference could've been in Connecticut or Vermont.
Oh my God, this man is gonna get naked in my apartment!
I'll call you back.
You're the most incredible woman I've ever met. How can I lose you? Now, I don't actually have a ring...
Ok, everybody, there's food and drinks on the table. Go across the hall.
Yeah, I got this number from this guy at work and I hired a stripper to come dance for you. Am I going in the wife hall of fame or what?!
So, what's this.
Right, you only go for them 5 minutes before they get married.
They're in the kitchen getting something to eat. Can you believe how nice they are?
You heard the woman. Peel, chop, devil! I can't believe I lost 2 minutes.
She's still mad.
Yeah. I think you have to draw him out. And then- when you do- he's a preppy animal.
Okay, knock yourself out, Larry.
Yeah.
Oh Will. But you-you've worked so hard...
Joey they're not real. I start miles beneath the surface of these things, ok, they're fake. See honk honk.
I'm a cool, fun aunt!
I'll take it down to 95% but that's the best I can do.
Right. Umm, listen since we're-we-re on that subject, umm, I just wanted to tell you that uh, well, I-I was going through a really hard time in London, what with my brother getting married and that guy thinking I was Ross's mother...
You have dinosaur checks?
Really? I'm perfectly comfortable. Hey, hey, hey, get in line buddy, I was next.
Yeah you're right, we can't-we shouldn't watch this.
Here, let me help you.
Go on.
My pink flowered bra! I recognize the strap!
I clunked your heads together!
Not that bad? Did you hear the hammer story?
Yeah!
Why do you guys have so many keys in there anyway?
Phoebe, I did not have sex.
Oh, I ordered mine first.
Excuse me?
Still smoking cigars?
What the hell happened?!
And listen to this...
You guys! Do you realize that any minute now, Phoebe can be pregnant?
Okay.
No, I haven't seen him.
Did you not hear where my head was? Come on! Come on we're a team! We're in this together!
Oh, I love this street. The trees, the big front yards, the actual picket fences.
Of course there's another guy!! This is even more perfect! Now you have to prove your love!
You gave her food poisoning!?
Okay, I'd like to know how much the room was because I'd like to pay my half.
What musician?
Um... hi there.
So, I guess you're next. You're ready?
Okay, throw it straight this time.
Phoebe is going to say "Yes" to David. See, that's what happens when you meddle in people's lives!
I'm not talking to her!
Okay, so it doesn't involve Ross or Rachel or Chandler or Joey. But, what about Pete?
Let me try.
Well, no, not at all, you're not terminal, you just, you just need some damage control.
I-I-I think you look great.
Ross, thats my jacket.
Thank you for letting us see the house again.
Yeah. The great thing about the jam plan was, I was taking control of my life. So I asked myself, what is the most important thing to me in the world and that's when I came up with the baby plan.
I don't think I'd care.
Aww, thank you.
Really? But tomorrow night is the only night I get off from the restaurant. If you go to the game, we won't have a night together for another week.
I can't find garbage bags!
Huh.
Oww!
Hey, maybe I'll drive you up there! I'd like to buy some tickets myself!
Why?
Oh no, it is okay, I mean as long as you know that Chandler and I are also very hot and fiery, just as hot as you! I mean our flame, whew, is on fire!
Yeah right.
You're the most wonderful man. And if you hadn't of said 'if I have to' like seventeen times, then I'd be saying 'okay, let's do it.'
-but that wouldn't be fair to me, it wouldn't be fair to Alan- It wouldn't be fair to you!
Don't get too attached, she's having it cremated.
I can't do it. I'm sorry, I wish I could, but umm, see you have these feelings for me....
Wait a minute, I think Phoebe's right. You know I hear someone else in there with him.
Hi Chandler. It's really nice to see you NOT.
I'm outa here.
Give me that!
No! Ace is low! Ace, two, three, four!
Op, can I just tell you something? Very flattered but umm, I'm engaged.
What was her name?
It's umm, it has something to do with transponding.
You and Mona are doing a holiday card together?
If you want, I'll do it.
Hey, we can take her back with you if you want.
Oh..
Why did you do that?
Yes! You are so smart! I love you.
Seriously, where did you get the hat?
Because the winner gets this!
I want a baby.
Phoebe, you'll catch pneumonia.
'Cause if you do that means you'd be cancelling it for me, and we're just friends.
Well, you're not working either.
Yes, I want to change. And why-why don't you go down and get us a table?
What do you mean?
What are you serious? You wanna marry him? Wha... What about Mike?
Phoebe, you were supposed to take that back!
No, you cannot.
Bobby.
Just go get some! Go!
Oh, I so can't believe this! My uterus is an inhospitable environment? I was trying so hard to be a good hostess!
Hey!
Aunt Syl, I did this as a favor, I am not a caterer. What do you want me to do with a dozen lasagnas? Nice talk, Aunt Syl. You kiss Uncle Freddie with that mouth?
Yeah, it's great.
Hello.
Ok worse case scenario is...we borrow some money from my parents.
Why, do you write him a lot?
Here's your key. All right, you have to christen it! Now, go out and come back in!
We'll see.
Oh no!
Sorry. But I kind of have this feeling that we may have made a baby last night.
Isn't this great?
So, I read this article in the paper the other day that says you're not supposed to throw rice at weddings, because when pigeons eat rice it kills them.
Okay fine! Fine! Then you know what, I'll just write about Phyllis! Hmm!
Because I put my head between her legs.
Really!
How?
You really think this is okay?
Chandler! He's your father; he should be at the wedding.
Woo-hoo, stuud!
So you stole that tape from Richard's apartment?
I'm also thinking about opening up my own restaurant.
If you would stop thinking about Ross for one minute you would notice that there are great guys everywhere! I mean, look! Look, Gunther! I mean, he's nice, he's cute.
Well if-if that's what it is, then it's-it's crazy.
Whoa-whoa-whoa, Phoebe you gotta take her! Y'know I-I-I said some really bad stuff about her, but y'know Rachel has some good qualities that make her a good roommate.
Mm-hmm.
Look what I got! Look what I got! Look what I got! Can you believe they make these for little people?
Oh, then you do know it. So um what kind of things do you write about?
Joey, why don't you put them in the lost and found?
Okay.
I've not seen her since high school graduation. Oh my God, that night she got so dru. . . motional.
Yay!
What, Phoebe, did you whip the potatoes? Ross needs lumps!
Okay, but there is a wire back there! I mean that switch is connected to something!
Hey! How'd your date go with Jake?
Oh, they're brochures from different adoption agencies.
No, sweetie, I-I trust you.
Hey.
Yes!
Joey, you know you don't actually have one.
So we're gonna try? I mean, are we trying?
We are on a roll, people!!
You didn't find her?
The second sister dies in Archie and Jughead Double Digest?
It's not Richard! Okay? It's this new guy and he's really good.
Alright.
What? So now I'm not allowed to fire him?
Well if you want a problem? I'll give you a problem!
Oh, I can't. We're throwing Phoebe a bachelorette party.
When Rachel was with Paulo, what did you do?
So Nancy told me about this job at this great restaurant, Javo . It's just a little outside of Tulsa.
Oh, thank you. Would you like a tour?
I have like five times, but the guy is so charming, that I go up there to yell and then I end up apologizing to him.
Oh, thanks! We'll try to stop by.
Haven't we made this decision?
Ooh, an ink stain! Hey, can I watch how you get this out?
Okay! There you go! It's two tickets to Vegas!
Sure, every time, you're such a princess...
Wow! You're a lot sturdier that Chandler. He crumpled like a piece of paper. So how was you're trip?
We're moving in a couple of days and we've got a lot of packing to do. It would be great if you guys could pitch in.
I don't know.
Whose little ball of paper is this?!
I mean this has been like my dream since I got my first Easy Bake Oven and opened Easy Monica's Bakery. I mean I would kill for this job. I mean I can totally do this job, and God knows I paid my dues. But Pete's just doing this because he has a crush on me.
Okay well, then we'll both do it today and he'll just have to deal with it!
Oh... How are they?
Joey!
All weekend? That's a whole lotta naked.
You know, they're not actually supposed to have... I'll work on the lumps. Joey, you're going home, right?
So are you ok?
Oh God.
Chandler, here you go, got your traditional Thanksgiving feast, you got your tomato soup, your grilled cheese fixin's, and your family size bag of Funyuns.
I was frustrated with you!
Oh yeah, what's the plan?
But we were hoping that since we told you the truth that you still might consider...
All right, everybody open them!
That's not possible!
Are you okay?
C'mon guys, it'll be fun!
How's that now?
Okay, but if we don't get this house, she's stil gonna show up wherever we go! I mean, at least if she's here, it eliminates the element of suprise. I mean, never again will you have to hear the three words that make your balls jump back up inside your body.
No, that seems about right.
Say it.
No, it is me! Y'know, I'm not just the person who needs to fluff the pillows and pay the bills as soon as they come in! Y'know, when I'm with her, I am so much more than that. I'm- I'm Monana!
God Ross, what is that?
That's my pie!
No, you're right. Mnya, we shouldn't do it like this. Huch. For what it's worth, I'm, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have come down on you so hard about the smoking. So you had a few cigarettes, not the end of the world.
Thanks.
But still, it's a big change. The end of an era, you might say!
Ok, so you've done some good work! What about your carry-ons?
Wonderful!
I can't believe they called, and we're actually getting a baby.
Is Joey here?
...If-you-say-so.
Yeah.
Oh! Do you need me to go with you?
Manhattan.
What is it hon?
Yes there is! He's black and white and shaggy and he's sitting next to Rachel and licking Rachel's hand.
Here you go sweetie.
No.
He was so good in that movie of MacBeth.
The dinner will be ready in twenty minutes. This is so exciting.
What? We took a walk, nothing happened. I can back with nothing all over me.
Oh God! I gotta go!
Joey...he's not even thinking about going after Rachel!
Is it better than the other salmon mousse?
Your mother told you this?
Isn't that cute?
Oh that's great!
We're supposed to uh, be spending a romantic weekend together, it-it, what is the matter with you?
Well, unless goose is a vegetable...ha haaaah!
You go girl. I can't pull that off can I?
Hi, umm I know this is last minute, but we've decided to throw an impromptu baby shower for Rachel today.
It's kind of an important one!
You have to help me! I'm supposed to be writing my vows and all I have is this!
Hello? It's the deli again!
Yeah, but I'm the only one related by blood.
Honey, we gotta go!
Why did you hire me?
I know! I mean it's like me and your dad, that's a totally separate thing.
So big deal, so Joey's had a lot of girlfriends, it doesn't mean he's great in bed.
It's okay. I don't care. It's uh, it's fine.
Okay, I feel like I'm talking to Lassie. All right, Phoebe would you just tell me!
Fine! Don't be my friends! I'll buy new friends! Yeah, and then I'll pay for their plastic surgery so they'd look just like you!
Windows are clean, candels are lit. Uh, belt's to tight, gotta change the belt. Did I turn the fish? No, cause I made lasagne. Am I out of control?
Aunt Syl, stop yelling! All I'm saying is that if you had told me vegetarian lasagna, I would have made vegetarian lasagna. Well, the meat's only every third layer, maybe you could scrape.
Really?
Did you hear that?! They bumped them up to first class because they are on their honeymoon! Come on! Let's act like we're on our honeymoon.
Pants and a sweater? Why, mom? Who am I gonna meet in a blackout? Power company guys? Eligible looters? Could we talk about this later? OK.
Well, she corned me! She asked if the wedding was in town! I mean, what was I supposed to do?!
Chandler, you're not fourteen anymore. Okay? Maybe it's time that you let that stuff go. If your father's not at your wedding...you're gonna regret it for the rest of your life.
Hey, this afternoon you said you'd be supportive...
No. I hate this part.
I'm gonna hang this basket on the door and when the neighbors walk by they can all take a piece.
Well, it doesn't really matter ... you're both wishing for the same thing, right?
This is insane!
Why not?!
Ow!! Ow!!!
I'm Monica Geller. I've been taking care of you.
How hammered are you? Huh? These, these are Joey's sisters.
No.
That's Great. You know we don't need to talk about this now. Really, I mean this is, is so way, way, way, in the future, I'm talkin' hovercrafts and apes taking over the planet.
I'm going into business people. I'm sick and tired of being depressed about Richard. I needed a plan, a plan to get over my man. What's the opposite of man? Jam. Oh Joey don't! It's way to hot.
Oh honey, is that 'cause your Mom died around Christmas?
She really left.
Ohh, absolutely.
Huh?
What are you doing?
Are you sure?
That's true.
I know.
Ohh... Oh, that's okay I hate when people come back to complement the chef. Like I have nothing better to do! So what's up?
Oh my-Oh good God!
Well then somebody's snoozing. Joey, not that this uh should affect you at all, but if you were to pick me, I was planning on wearing a sequined dress, cut down to here.
We both do that!
You are both idiots. The joke is not funny, and it's offensive to women, and doctors, and monkeys! You shouldn't be arguing over who gets credit, you should be arguing over who gets blamed for inflicting this horrible joke upon the world! Now let it go! The joke sucks!
Well, I'm never gonna listen to you again, that's for sure! "Y'know, harm can it do if you go and put your name down?"
Y'know what's weird?
No one.
Oh honey, we're close now but you-you wouldn't believe the years of-of nugies, and wedgies, and flying wedgies, and atomic wedgies, and.... That's where the waistband actually goes over your head.
Yeah. What d'you wanna do tonight?
Can you believe he just offered me a restaurant?
Three down knows I'm married, what's three down doin'?
Hey.
Yeah, we really do!
Weren't you asked to leave sonny?
Hey!
No Joey, I think he's just watchin' TV.
Yeah, just like the one in the poem.
Right there! That was so fake!
No way!
Why would you do that?
Or if you want to kiss him, umm, you could use mistletoe.
All right, all right! Let's just cut to the chase, okay? You're single. You're single. He gets off work at eleven. She'll be waiting for your call. I'll give him your number if I can get one calamari and one Caesar salad!! I did not yell. I am not putting a dollar in the jar.
Hi! If you're calling before Saturday, you've reached Monica and Chandler. But if you're calling after Saturday, you've reached Mr. and Mrs. Bing! Please leave a message for the Bings!
And I would have to say pah-huh.
What about my questions?
Well, he's my parents' best friend, he has to be there.
I'm sorry, I didn't know to look for Chinese food on the floor.
What are you doing with those?!
Yeah, he's gonna work on that.
Hello, people who do not live here.
We're all sorry...
Why not?
We owe you?!
Honey why don't you go lie down.
Umm, if ah, it might be okay if Ross came skiing?
So, where do you want to go?
What?! Oh.
I'm not a baby, you're the baby.
Hey!
Yes, it was!
No, no, not a party. Just a surprise gathering of some people Rachel knows. Um, this is Phoebe and Chandler and Joey.
Honey? Is that something you're making up?
I can't believe he's that upset about this...
I got it! How about, if we win, they have to get rid of the rooster?
Sounds smart and healthy to me. So um, just out of curiosity, um, do you currently have any other racquetball buddies?
We don't, we don't wrestle now.
God! If you're gonna cry about it!
See you guys later.
Actually, I was gonna do them jullienne.
You are so cute.
Do you wanna do it at the same time?
Sure.
Hi!
I know! What is this, 1985?!
Noo! My ex-boyfriend Richard! Y'know the tall guy, moustache?
Okay, sperm donor number 03815, come on down! Okay, he's 6'2", 170 pounds, and he describes himself as a male Geena Davis.
I paid to have this done.
Wow!
Ohh, he's really shy. I-I don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet.
That's right.
Oh, this is so hard.
Ugh, I can not believe this! I mean, who is she to judge us? We could not have been nicer to her!
I said that you had a nice butt, it's just not a great butt.
All right. Mmm-mmm.
What?!
