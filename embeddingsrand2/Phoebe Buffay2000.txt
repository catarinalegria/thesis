Oh, I hate this. Everything's changing.
Yes you do! This is your third divorce! You love divorce so much you're probably gonna marry it! Then it won't work out and you're gonna have to divorce it, divorcing guy. I'm so drunk.
Bye, good luck.
She's dead.
Look out, incoming pumpkin pie!
What are you doing?
About 20 minutes. CLOSING CREDITS
I feel like my face is swelling. Is my face swelling?
I dunno, 'cause you're smart, you're funny...
Have umm, have you thought anymore about you and Rachel?
No-no-no oh, keep your name, don't take his name.
Uh-huh. Now you can turn around or you can go in there and rip the Band-Aid off. What to you want to do?
Well, nobody wants a ghost. But you've got one, because the house is sitting on an ancient Indian burial ground.
So what are they doing?
Rosss can! Give me the tickets! Ross can give me the tickets!!
You're just so mean to each other! And I don't want to end up like that with Rachel. I still like you!
And why not?!
Yeah! Let's do it! Let's live together! Oh god, we're really going to move in together!
Whoa-whoa-whoa, you guys, do you know anything about chicks?
Phoebe. Phoebe. Phoebe, yeah. She named me after you I guess.
Noooo! Ok, maybe if we just break it down. Ok, let's try at one syllable at a time. Ok? So repeat after me. "je".
No, you don't! She's going to Paris! She is going to meet somebody. Do you know how many hot guys there are in Paris? It's... It's a city of Gunthers!
What's the big deal, y'know? It's not like it's a real marriage.
Listen Ross, we ran out of gas, and we don't know where we are, so we can't get a tow truck.
I-I sure will, take care.
Oh, hi, Mrs. Waltham. I need to speak with ether one of the best men, or Ross's sister Monica.
Yeah. I really hate to give her up. Oh, I know!! Oh, you should take her!
I hope I win!
I'm done now.
Okay, I think I need to do some shopping.
It's ok, it's ok. I made my decision. What I really want is a great big wedding.
Oh my God! That's the creep that you're with at the Statue of Liberty.
Wow, you guys go way back then. So what are you up to these days?
It was really fun, I mean I've never talked on a car phone before.
No! You don't have to do anything! Just don't tell them that we know!
Hey! Check it out! This is unbelievable! Joey has been holding his breath for almost four minutes!
Sure! I feel so bad for you; I broke my leg once too.
And y'know, even if they break up again, you'd better not let him in your sad men's club!
So okay what? You're gonna be married to a girl who doesn't even know about it?!-Op, woman! Sorry.
I don't. He got...he-he-he-he's hit by a bus.
But there's a whole table of mini-muffin baskets. Which one did you send?
Popes in a Volkswagen! ...I love that joke.
Okay, what about after I give you these candies?
Oh, he-he can't talk right now.
Okay.
Yes. Yes! Fine! I am someone! You want me to say it? I have doubts! I'm sorry!
That might work!
Yes.
I'm just saying hi! Now I'm gonna go!
Well, it was really sweet, and like the most romantic thing ever.
I'll have coffee.
If it was, would you stop hanging out with her?
Found the vest! I mean we're gonna have to keep an eye on it, y'know make sure we don't lose it again...
Maybe that's 'cause she's not really gone.
Oh God! Is that veal?
Hey!
Ok, Ben, this is the part where Ernie buries Bert in the sand and can't find him. Now, I've looked ahead on the tape and he does find him again. But, ok, before that happens, there's some pretty rough goin' for a while but I think we can handle it. And, there's just the alphabet but we know that ends well so. Ok, here we go.
Well not clients, lovers. But let's just y'know, try it again. Come back and-and we'll work through it.
I'm-I'm just saying, don't freak out until you're a hundred percent sure.
Oh my God!! The baby just kicked!
All right, I'm gonna go take a pregnancy test, right now.
Oh! I knew it! I knew it! I felt really thick this morning.
I don't know. I don't know. I can't lie to him again. Oh no I-no! I'm just gonna press my breasts up against him.
Oh, you just caught me off guard! Yeah, that would be nice.
I know, but that creep that I went on that date with goes to there so I have to find a new one. I also have to find a new video store, a new bank, a new adult bookstore, a new grocery store...
I did it! I took care of the babies all by myself!
You know it's me?
Oh, which museum?
No.
We've got shoes being kicked off over here.
Oh! No problem! I...
Umm, well I sorta have some bad news, can I come in?
Yeah.
I dunno, let's see! So, okay, I dreamt that we were gonna get married, and he left, becuz he had to go fight a fire. And, um, so okay, I went to a night club, and I saw him making out with a girl.
What a beautiful night to be running around the street, looking for tickets. And the wind sure made it fun.
All right, hold on! Okay, let's just all think.
You mean whenever Monica and Chandler where like y'know doing laundry or going grocery shopping or-Oh! All that time Monica spent on the phone with sad Linda from camp!
Oh my God! I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Which one's Demi Moore?
There he is! There he is!
You completely stole my answer!
Get your garlic-peelers off me!
All right, and umm...
Yeah, y'know what I noticed Rachel? He scares easy. Is that the kind of guy you'd like to take to a ball? "Hey Sebastian, would you like to dance?" "Uhh, okay-I gotta go!"
My chest hurts! Oh, and now I-I can't breathe.
Of course I can! It's just good sense to backup your backup! Look, I've already lost Chandler!
Oh, well, it's a shame that you-that you miss the movie 'cause we were gonna see, you know, either "Liar, Liar" or "Betrayal", or... "An Affair To Remember".
Ok, it's very faint, but I can still sense him in the building. Go into the light, Mr. Heckles!
Well, it's great that you're back! How are you?
Oh.
Okay, alright, I have a question, then.
Oh yeah? Well, let's see. Ok, duck down.
Hey, guys, you know what Larry would say? He would say, "See you ladle."
Like what?
Yeah, well I had to learn, I was staying at the Y and some off the young men weren't acting Christian enough.
I know! I know! I know!
Well, do you think I should propose?
And you're so sweet. And you're kind
Oh, what was that for? Like a bake sale?
Well, then you should come tonight. You know, just hang out with them. Let them see what a great guy you still are.
Because I'm going to kill him
Nope, not knocked up yet.
Oh, nobody's judging you.
Oh that's all right. I'm still full from your homemade potato chips.
Hello? Hey Joey!
I got me some drinks!
Listen, sorry about your death, that really sucks.
Oh no, no, no, no... That's okay, that's okay... I mean, I'm... I am a vegetarian... except for veal... Yeah no, veal I love...
All right, I'm sorry.
No! No!
Ohh, umm, we kinda took a little detour on the way over here.
Yeah you're always singing "Yummy yummy yummy, I've got love in my tummy"
Mike Crap Bag?
No it's not, sorry.
Y'know, there's gonna be lots of other stuff.
I'm sorry, it's just, I'm a little short on cash.
Uh-huh! Ross invited us all to watch.
Sounds like somebody wants to be Mr. Pizza Delivery Girl.
Ooh! Hi!
Smoked a joint? You know, lit a bone? Weed? Hemp? Ganja?
Or maybe he-he was writing to tell her that-that he's changed his name, y'know? Tell Monica I'm sorry.
Um, well, Max told me about Minsk, so congratulations! This is so exciting!
Hornswoggle? Ooh, this must be killing you.
Wait-wait-wait! Wait!!
Umm, my friend, Bonnie. She just always thought Ross was really cute, and now that you two aren't together, she asked if I could set it up, but if you're not cool with it...
Yeah, you like that don't you?
Chandler, Chandler.
Well, I didn't get embarrassed running next to Miss . But no, okay. No, no, I can see why running with me would be embarrassing to you. Yeah, okay. You're uptight.
That's fair! Thank you so much. Thanks. Oops, it looks like when he got the pastry chef he got you a little bit too.
Umm, I'm a masseuse...by day.
I know you're just moving uptown but I'm really gonna miss you.
I've already stuffed a bunch of Brussel sprouts down his pants.
Well, I mean, then what happens if it doesn't work out?
Ooh, Atlantic City! Oh, that's a great plan! Who's plan was that?
Okay, I will. But right after you tell me who the hell you are.
Oh yeah! Oh, I can do that.
Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm, who's next?
Je m'appelle Claude.
Well, how about a compromise then, okay? What if it's like y'know, Chanoey?
Yes!
Good. I should really start wearing hats!
Oh! Here it is! Ooh, Joey! Why did you sign it, "Son of a bitch?"
Me too! So happy for them!
Great! It worked! No one's sad.
Uhuh.
Yeesh, what'd you do about it?
Really?!
Yeah, I know. Oh, good thing it's one of those 801 numbers. Right?
Oh. Hey!
Is that a real place? Are they hiring?
Hi. Y'know in England this car would be on the other side of the store. Woo!
Oh no, Rach, no no, you know you're never supposed to wake a sleeping baby.
Or we could use it to call China. See how those guys are doing.
My guy is well read.
Yeah, okay.
Yeah, I've discovered that Ross forgot to take his brain medicine, uh, now without it, uh, in the brain of Ross, uh women's names are interchangeable, through-through no fault of his own.
Oh, yeah, it's my mom's.
It's really crazy! The hall, the dress, the food... I-I had no idea how expensive this stuff was!
Oh, I am having the best karma this week. First, I find this woman who knew my parents, and then my client with the fuzzy back gives me his beach house.
Well, I can't help you.
Stick a fork what?
You're actually going through with this?
So, what movie should we see?
Potato, potaato.
Hi, Ben. I'm your father. I am... the head. Aaaaaahhhh.... Alright, this barbecue is gonna be very fun.
I can do that.
Hey!
So Theodore... I uhm... I can see where Mike gets his good looks from...
Yeah, yeah, no it's OK 'cause, I mean, I know he's there, so, that's enough for now.
We're so stupid! Do you know what's going on in there? They're trying to take Joey!
Excuse me. Excuse me! Thanks. Um, clearly this is a very, very hard time for you. Um, but, um, we provided a service, and we deserve to be paid because you ate that service, and, um, we are not leaving here until we're paid every penny. 'Cause you know what, lady? We're part time caterers, and we have no place else to go.
Huh?
No.
Yay, okay!
Well, y'know we don't call it that, but yeah!
I didn't see this on the menu.
Wow! You really go all out when you're expecting company.
Oh, hey, Chandler I wanna hug you too!
Hey!
Oh my God! I don't believe it! Oh, you poor bunny.
What, what is that?
It's okay, I mean she had a really incredible life. And it's not like I'm never gonna see her again, y'know she's gonna visit.
Why not?
Um-mmm, and I won't have to go there anymore because I gave them my correct address.
OK, Rachel, why don't you start talking first.
Okay, Seasons Greetings and everything, but still...
Okay.
It was an accident, and, and the woman who did this would never ever hurt a dog on purpose. She's a vegetarian.
Ooh! I thought of a good flaw! Ross pops his gum!
Do you not know each other?
Oh, this is terrible. Oh, they've made so many changes I can't even feel my grandmother's presence anymore-Ooh! New sconces!
Umm, cups.
Or you can do volunteer work.
No, it's not! We were just goofing around and I dared him to try them on.
Intense and creepy.
I hope it's you.
Hi.
Hey Joey, I just wanted to let you know that I found a selfless good deed. I just went down to the park and I let a bee sting me.
Why not?! Maybe I can, you don't know!
So you're a gladiator! Wow!
Uhu, uhu... and why do you think that is?
Yeah, well, we'll see about that. Can I use your phone? I just wanna call everyone I know.
And then. I would use y'know the strongest tool at my disposal. My sexuality.
Oh, it's so great to see you feeling like this!
Okay sure!
If you could do that, I'd marry the hippity-hop.
Well, I mean, I'm not married married, ya know, he's just a friend and he's gay and he's just from Canada and he just needed a green card.
Well, they may be a handful, but they're so cute.
Yes, yes! Like the man in the shoe!
John Glenn is here?!
Well, I was thinking...
You know what, we're gonna have sex. Let's just leave it there.
Hey! Check it out! This is unbelievable! Joey has been holding his breath for almost four minutes!
Theodore... Bitsy... What a delight!
Come on, take 'em off!!
Hey!
Sticky shoes, sticky shoes, always make me smile. Sticky shoes, sticky shoes, next time I'll.... avoid the..... pillleeeee.
Can you believe this? We were waiting for a hot guy and then an even hotter one shows up!
All right. Good luck.
Who was that?
Good plan.
All right, all right, we'll just do our best. Okay? So let's say I'm the interviewer and I'm meeting you for the first time. Okay. "Hi! Come on in, I'm uh, Regina Philange."
Rachel.
Oh.
Shh, wait and see. Maybe we will, maybe we won't.
Monica, you call it.
Yeah?
Oh, Monica, grow up!
Oh that's good, I guess she'll have a choice between my guy and your weirdo.
That's it. Just relax.
Does anyone want the rest of this Pop-Tart?
What a great night, Chandler can't do it, these guys kissed...
Oh, really?
Good. Y'know-no-no, okay, it's-it feels like everything's been about me lately, so what's happening with you?
It's time.
Hmm, I wonder why. Pervert!
Good.
Well, we just decided that Rachel is gonna be your maid of honor.
I'm just taking it to be re-wired.
Uh-uh. Ehm, a Knicks game.
Please?
Well, some things are just hard to say to your face.
Bye!
It's not a stupid gumball machine looking ring! It's a beautiful ring!
Okay, Lesson One: Chords. Now, I Don'T Know The Actual Names Of The Chords But Umm, I-I-I Made Up Names For The Way My Hand Looks While I'M Doing Them. So then, this is Bear Claw. Okay, umm, Turkey Leg and Old Lady.
Thank you! And Happy Holidays.
Okay. All right, this is my favourite part of the weekend, right now, this.
Maybe, maybe I'll dance for you.
You're kinda stepping on the song.
That was a test and you just failed.
Okay, Monica's are the biggest.
No. No! No! ...So, um, do you think he's doing any better than he was this morning?
Oh. Ah-uh.
Hey!
Right. My name was on there, but now it just says "carrot cake". So, um, so um, how many chords do you know?
Yeah well, she certainly knew what she was doing New Year's Eve 1997.
Ooh! That's Good! Wow! But Now If You Were Pregnant, What Would You Name It? Hint Phoebe.

Yeah, I know, it's gonna be even worse for you... God... Ross, get ready to do some serious crying.
No. They said you 'Weren't believable as a human being.' So, you can work on that.
Oh, no, I meant that it's weird that you only have nine now.
Okay, we'll talk about something else then.
Why?! You two are so meant to be together, everybody thinks so.
You know what, that's it, that's it.
You mean in case someone is trying to steal your bamboo sleeping mat or your kettle of fish?
This is everybody. This is Ross.
So, I decided I'm definitely going to go with either Joey or Chandler.
Okay, don't freak out. I'll go.
Uh-huh!
Did I miss it, did I miss it?
Yeah. Why aren't you with Rachel?
Something just brushed up against my right leg!
Now, are you sure you don't want to go see a doctor?
Oh! Joey uh, were you in our room last night?
Yeah!
Okay. Okay! Well okay, who do we know that's coming? Me. Are you?
Yeah well, in America you're just an "ass".
Because you'll date her once, sleep with her and then forget she exists!
Yeah, otherwise, I mean that's, that's, that's just it for us hanging out together. Y'know is that what you want? Can you be civil?
Ohh, impressive.
Yeah.
"Pick up grandma at the airport"?
Umm, no thank you.
How about just the bridemaids?
Oh we do, but not just yet.
Oh! What is that? What is that?
Because you're marrying him!
Hey.
I don't accept this rule. When me make plans, I expect you to show up. Okay, I can't just be a way to kill time 'til you meet someone better! Y'know boyfriends and girlfriends come and go, but this is for life!
Uh, we were at the Spelling Bee!
Just, 'cause, I don't want her to go through what I went through with Carl- oh!
Uh uh.
Okay, yeah. Triple A can pick us up.
Okay.
Oh, ok, you know what I don't get? The way guys can do so many mean things, and then not even care.
Yes, and it is my dying wish to have that ring. See, if I'm not buried with that ring then my spirit is going to wander the nether world for all eternity...
Oohh, um, no, I don't think that's the problem. 'Cause we went, um, dancing the other night and the way he held me so close, and the way he was looking into my eyes I just like... definitely felt something.
Thank you.
Yeah. Oh, can I come?
Please.
Oh yeah, right now.
Can I get you something to drink? Like a water and Valium?
No, you can't go. No-no-no, I can't hold this table on my own. If they ask me to move, I cave.
Well, maybe we will. Oh!
Listen, Robert's gonna be here any second so, will one of you just tell him?
Relax every muscle in your body. Listen to the plinky-plunky music. Okay, now close you eyes, and think of a happy place. Okay, tell me your happy place.
More bandages! More bandages! Please, can I get some more bandages in here! This man is dying- Oh no.
Congratulations!
What's up? Tell Monica I'm sorry. Tell her yourself!
No! No! It's just that he gave me three tickets and there are six of us!
Oh down please. I-I hate to be a ball buster can I just do it?
What you got?
I don't know what I'm gonna do about this coat.
Oh, let me see!
Why? Why do I have to learn?
You gotta go!
You are a terrific actor.
Helloo! Oh!
Well okay but I have two tickets to the ballroom dance finals.
And also, we don't know what to do with this.
Well, it's a long story. It's kind of embarrassing. Let's just say there was a typographical error with a sex manual. How about you?
Hey! Oh, how did baby shopping go?
Well I'm sorry Rachel, but I'm not like you, ok? Not everyone can afford help.
Touchdown!! Touchdown!!
How come?
Ohhhh.
I want to see what he wants first.
Ooh, who's it for?
Well, Susan, I see what appears to be a dark vent. Wait. Yes, it is in fact a dark vent.
You're kidding! And he plays rugby?! That's so funny. Ohh! I see how you did that. All right.
Hey! Look who I found!
Uh huh.
Well, you kind of just did. That guy is going to call you tonight. Ross is going to pick up the phone and that's a pretty clear message.
No, that wouldn't kill her. Ordinary embolism might.
Are you kidding? That's what sisters are for. Frank Jr. : Look at them! Aw. I love you so much. Oh crap, don't wake up, don't wake up!
That she's gonna move in with you and maybe then she'll fall in love with you and then when she finds out you're already married, she'll just be happy. Y'know? You're just, you're very sad.
So you guys, I'm doing all new material tonight. I have twelve new songs about my mother's suicide, and one about a snowman.
Whatever! What about you Meg?
Ooh! Oh!
Well, but thats what he was for me. And she you know, kind of stole him away, and then... broke his heart... and then he wouldnt even talk to me any more. Because he said he didnt wanna be around... anything that looked like either one of us.
Okay.
So, did you pick one yet?
A birthday party.
How sweet! Oh, is that the baby?
Oh, you're not going? Oh, why?
Uhm... Stockholm.
Hey! So Chandler, wanna go to the coffeehouse?
Oh yeah, the doctor said that could be one of the side effects.
Oh, come on Will! Just take off your shirt and tell us!
Was it not pain-free?
Oh, well... 'cause.... you just... I don't like this question.
Oh, no no, that side doesn't have one, the paramedics had to cut through it.
Does it look like an ashtray?
No you didn't!
Yeah. You're trying to figure out where you know me from? All right, I'll give you a hint. From porn! Okay? Yeah your pervert boyfriend watched me in a porno movie! See?
Okay. So, what are you?
C'mon Mike, you can beat her! Knock that dog off her head!
I won! I won! I finally won!
Ross, you're being ridiculous! Okay? You are cute and smart and sweet and that is much more important than three stupid divorces!
Ok.
So instead you told me Monica was pregnant.
Chandler, I found the perfect ring.
Hey Rachel?
Hey.
Rachel has something that she wants to tell you and umm, I believe that this is your red sweater.
Hey...
I can't help it. I need the meat. The baby needs the meat.
Well at least all my songs don't taste like garlic. Yeah, there are other ingredients Monica.
We were at the game, and this guy proposed to his girlfriend on the big screen thing...
Say we are unagi!
Or, we can decide by whose ever name is closer to the word phone.
Oh okay.
Oh! Oop!
Oh my God! Monica's gonna totally freak out!
She's just so cute! I just wanna bite her ear off and use it and a sucking candy.
Hey Rach, you wanna get some coffee?
Fine. But you can't help me develop my new universal language.
Ok, all right. We want to hear everything. Monica, get the wine and unplug the phone. Rachel, does this end well or do we need to get tissues?
What's the matter? Why so scrunchy?
That's not good.
Wait, you know what, I got a little story. When I was in Junior High School I went through this period where I thought I was a witch. And there was this guidance counselor who said something to me, that I think will help you a lot. He said okay, 'you're not a witch you're just an average student.' See what I'm saying?
Rachel, it's okay. You don't have to do this. I believe you. All right? Okay, if-if you say that you kissed Melissa, then you kissed Melissa.
Well, we were um, sorta invited to go skiing, y'know Rachel's sister's cabin.
No, you can't go there! You know how I feel about these "big massage places"! They're putting people like me out of business!
Oh ok, Ryan, that guy I went out with, who's in the Navy.
Thanks you guys! Thank you.
Sure! Look, ok, bottom line: I love Mike... David! David. I love David. Don't look at me that way, Roseanne Rosannadanna!
Oh no, you're not supposed to be here. This is the staging area, you should, it's all wrong, you should leave, ya know, get out. Or perhaps you'd like a creme d'menthe.
It's so obvious, why doesn't he just ask?
Oh my god, Rachel asked me if I knew anyone for her too.
It's your thing, and-
Yes. Well, that's neither here nor there.
See, he's her lobster.
Okay, we're on it. We're on it.
I know, I know! I'm like playing the field. Y'know? Like, juggling two guys, I'm sowing my wild oats. Y'know? Y'know, this kind've like y'know oat-sowin', field-playin' juggler.
I think that uh, yours is a question with many answers.
'Cause my, my grandmother's never had chicken pox. Please, please tell me you have, 'cause oh my God, I forgot how cute you are.
Yeah, not the one I had my eye on.
Well, he made a move on me.
Much as you are.
You ask an intriguing question Chandler Bing.
Okay, let's go running!
TELL ME WHAT YOU KNOW!
Y'know, suddenly I find you very attractive.
Hey the wedding is so close! Are you getting nervous?
Yeah! But I'm a little shaky and nervous.
No that is the last thing you want to do!
So now what do we do?
Thank you, mister Bag.
Hi Emily!
Well, Gladys say hello to your new home!
You didn't read this one either?!
Gary.
Totally.
Ross?
Good. It's just so hard, it's hard for me to ... let them go. I guess it just brings back memories, you know, from ... when I gave birth to my brother's triplets and I had to give them up. I haven't told you about that yet, have I?
Oh we can't, we already have plans.
Aw ... what?
Oh that's right. You're still set on that?
Sure you can! Give them some blocks, put them in a playpen!
No. What do you, what do you want me to be, like some stupid, big, like, purple dinosaur?
Hummus. I got the hummus.
Okay.
That's him.
What is that?
But... but... but we're giving you this!
Oh my God, I didn't...
Ah! Okay so that would make me Susan.
No I'm not okay. The only guy I've ever been crazy about has gone to Minsk and I may never...I may never see him again.
Oh my God, it's all so elegant! When's the dirty stuff starting?
Give it.
Uh-huh.
That's not very enlightened!
Yeah. Well, we called everyone in your phone book and bunch of people came, but it took us so long to get you here that they-they had to leave.
I see. Nice sidestep on the do do thing by the way.
My guy has great teeth!
Hey!
Hold it! N.Y.P.D! Freeze punk!
Absolutely, oh I promise. Tell her what?
Oh well y'know.
Monica and Chandler said that you were having so much fun here. And apparently no amount of drums or tarantulas is gonna change that.
Oh! Hello? Yeah this is Phoebe. Really?!
Ohh-oh, chilling!
Oh, OK, so then what is it? Some kind of... you know, like, like... some kind of, y'know, like... alright, what is it?
I wanna hear "The Sound."
I remember the day I got my first pay check. There was a cave in in one of the mines, and eight people were killed.
Hey, you guys, listen, this weekend we're all gonna go to Las Vegas to surprise Joey! Including me!! You wanna go?!
Uh-huh.
Oh, yeah!
Ooh, sorry. Um, and, and then you put your arms around me. And then you put your arms around me. And, um, and then you tell me that you love me and you'll never forget me.
Hey, does Monica know about her broken plates yet?
Yeah, but not just that.
Okay, thank you, Mr. Heckles.
Okay fine! Fine! We'll just have to think of some other way to put the whole 'Who came onto who,' thing to rest! Come on now, think!!
Yeah, but then Jacques Cousteau came and he kicked his ass for betraying me! It was soo cool! Then, he took me diving and he introduced me to his pet seahorse, who, by the way, was totally coming on to me, and please, that is not gonna happen.
I know I'm not, but you are, and I was trying to spare your feelings.
Wait! Oh wait! Oh no!
All right, y'know forget hypnosis. The way to quit smoking is you have to dance naked in a field of heather, and then bath in the sweat of six healthy young men.
I miss Janice though. "Hello, Chandler Bing."
I'm wearing his briefs right now.
Another amazing find! Wow! Oh I bet this has a great story too!
But.
You did it!
I-I'm with the umm, the 57th.
What are you talking about?!
Hurry! Monica's gonna make you pack! She's got jobs for everyone! Now, it's too late for me, but save your selves!
You okay with this?
What's with all the bottles of liquor?
Yep, lipstick and a daughter, big day for you!
Okay. And, my, dead, mother, says, you, are, it. I'm with Rachel.
From the nursery rhyme. 'There was a crooked man, Who had a crooked smile, Who lived in a shoe, For a... while...'
Have you seen your guy's body?
Hey.
All right, I will. No, I will. But umm, y'know just remember that it's still really early, okay so, if it says that I'm not pregnant, that doesn't mean that I'm not gonna get pregnant, okay and, and just please, just so I don't go completely nuts, just try not put all your hopes on this.
No, we can go together! Just don't wait too long though, okay? 'Cause I'm outta here sometime before Friday.
Ok.
No. Here. There. Ooh, double sixes.
What?
Yeah, I did. I think it sounds y'know big sistery, y'know, 'Frank's always late.'
Yeah! I wrote Emma a song.
Give her a key to your apartment.
Happy Holidays. Feliz Navidad. Allo, and Merry Christmas. Ohh thank you sir. Here's some joy.
With who?
Well, Racquela's right, yeah!
You know her?!
I'll have to get back to you on that. Okay, bye! Oh my God! He wants me to come over and feel his bicep and more!
Oh! What what what! ...Hi.
Umm, yeah, uh-huh, they're implanted.
Yep, we shook on it. Yeah but believe me that is not how he wanted to seal the deal.
So you're not homesick yet?
Hi! It's me. And soup. Hey, I just saw Josh, he looks so yummy in your leather jacket.
Oh, I don't make them a lot because I don't think it's fair to the other cookies
Umm, the street. Come on, let's go to the street. Ooh, listen, don't go onto the balcony until after I get back.
Vince is a fireman.
Yeah.
Or you could teach stripping. You know, share your gift, pass the torch.
Shhhhhh! I'm swamped right now.
Umm... Wow, all right. Wow! Yay! Ooh, I'm gonna meet a guy! And really soon! And he's gonna be the man of my dreams. Probably not the guy I had a dream about last night.
Oh, I-I gave them the puppy and it made them so happy that I decided I'm gonna carry their baby.
What?!
Another lie. You have a sickness!
Ok, well, alright, who thinks the food is fine, the music was fine, but your evening was ruined by this incessant poll taking? .
So you're gonna move?
Oh my God.
Or! I should rush through dinner with Joey and I can meet David at 9:00!
Frank! Hi!
Mexico! End credits.
Why not?
One, two, three!
Yeah... Oh Bitsy, hi. Uhm... listen I just wanted to thank you again for having me here tonight.
I'm not asking!
Okay.
Ohh, you and your ways. Since it's Christmastime. I'm going to be one of those people collection donations.
Well just figure out a way to talk him out of it.
Okay.
Are you moving out?
Well, you're just gonna have to try.
Oh, hello liar.
Sting's son, seven years old and there's a picture.
Why?
Wow, that's great! I liked that better than the law thing, so...
Oh, Paolo, hi, what are you doing here?
That is so sweet. But don't you think it's a little too soon? I mean there's so much we don't know about each other.
What's that smile? Did something happen with you two?
pelle.
Uh-huh.
You knew this and you never said anything?! With all the stupid dinosaur stuff you tell us?!
You guys, you know what I just realized? 'Joker' is 'poker' with a 'J.' Coincidence?
It kicked! I think the baby kicked!
This is how I look when I'm turned on!
Y'know what, forget it. It's ruined.
Well, it helps the bee look tough in front of his bee friends. The bee is happy and I am definitely not.
Hey Rach, will you come with me to a dressing room?
Excuse me, Ross, old friends catching up.
Chandler, you stink of cigarettes.
She cancelled! My namesake cancelled on me!
David! What-what are you doing here? Aren't you supposed to be in Russia?
I got it.
Still going through that dry spell with Carol?
Grandma's gonna have to get in line.
Nothing, I just thought I'd stop by.. y'know, after the uh... that I.. y'know, so what are you doing here?
HEY! Mike called were going out again! YAY! YAY!
Yeah, you should.
Ohh!
Nesele Toulouse.
And he's going to be paying this woman? Why doesn't he just give her like a throne, and a crown, and like a, you know, gold stick with a ball on top.
What?!!
Oh how lame... oh, it's so tacky, and impersonal.
YE-AH!
Well, he came in for a massage and everything was fine until...
Oh, okay, oh.
Yeah, isn't it fantastic?
Um-um, um-um.
Good.
No-no, oh, I'm fine with the age thing y'know, until it starts sticking it's tongue down my little brother's throat!
Oh stop it.
That true, I am flaky.
Alright, okay, so we can all go now. That is fun. Hey, you know what? We all haven't been together the six of us in such a long time.
So, what did Rachel say when you told her you were still married to her?
But, let's play this one first. And remember whoever talks first loses!
So nothing got ruined?
Hey!
Oh are you and Chandler...
See? I'm doing it. I am totally doing it. I lost it.
All right, so, so you went to Pete's...
I want you to stay.
Hell, I'm drunk right now! What? I can't have a mimosa with breakfast?! I'm on vacation!
I know, I just want to bite his bottom lip. But I won't.
Wow, that's close. When's yours?
God, I wish Mike were here.
Yep.
What's in the bag?
Well, his name is Parker and I met him at the drycleaners.
Oh...yes..is this..umm..Emily's Parents' house.
Don't tear it.
Oooh! I have something you can do! I have this new massage client... Steve? Anyway, he's opening up a restaurant and he's looking for a head chef.
Uh huh! If it's a girl, Phoebe, and if it's a boy, Phoebo!
Mazel tov.
Oh, so, how are we doing?
Okay, can you really tapdance?
Huh?
See? This is exactly why you shouldn't lie!
Kyle's ex-wife? You were supposed to divert her not date her!
That's like the pervert motto! Yeah! Yeah! They have you raise your right hand, put your left hand down your pants, and repeat that!
Much less happy!
I wouldn't say never, you know there's that guy well what about ok well there's gotta be someone.
I'm sorry, there's laughing in my head.
Okay. Oh my God! What did I ever do to you?!
Yeah, Chandler why don't you take a walk? This doesn't concern you.
"Crazy underwear, creepin' up my butt. Crazy underwear, always in a rut. Crazy under--wear..." Oh No! What is he doing here? All right, just keep playing, just keep playing. You'll get through this; you'll be fine. Okay, thank you. And, as always no one talk to me after the show.
I just thought we might be here for awhile. You know, things might get musical.
Okay. Wait, do you know how you're going to stall her?
Ooh, honey. You stink at lying.
Yeah.
Ok, all right.
We found your test in the trash, if you're not pregnant--It's because I am.
Your boobs are fine. Look, I never should have said anything. Come here. Come here. Oh, can't make.... hands... meet....
Look everybody, look at my new dollhouse!!
Mike knows I'm coming, and if I don't show up he'll think it's because of him! And I don't want to lose face! That's a very serious thing in my culture.
It's a Ms. Pac-Man machine!!
Okay, I wanna be sexy again so I'm trying to catch a cold. It should be easy, supposedly they're pretty common.
Um, I'm getting a lily for my Mom. 'Cause her name's Lily.
That is so cruel! Why? Why would a parent name their child Bethel?
Ohh that's so sweet! Oh! Hang on! Hang onnnnnn!!! Go!! No! No-no! I said sell when it hits 50! 5-0, it's a number! It comes after 4-9!! No, it's okay. It's okay, you're allowed one mistake. Just kidding, you are of course fired.
It's not all mine. We all get 50 cents.
No, I do not hear that.
I'd call that excessive.
Wow. Thank you.
You don't like ice cream?
Umm, Phoebe Buffay.
Y'know I'm-I'm sensing that um, my grandmother would not be comfortable with that.
Bye.
All right-Ooh! Oh dead God, save me!
Okay Joey? Chandler's here, he was wondering... Okay, I guess he ran out of change.
Wow, look at these prices.
Don't be worried about that! Your tombstone can say whatever you want it to say! It could say, Ross Geller, Good at Marriage! Y'know? Mine's gonna say Phoebe Buffay, Buried Alive.
No no no, I'll be nice, I swear!!! Could you just give me the number for where they are?
Oh! Here we all are! Yeah, there's Ross and Joey and you and me.
Uhuh. Because I'm a single mother, supporting my two children.
Not even if you just pretend that it's milk?
They give you away! There's just-there's just too much wisdom in there. Just put some tea bags on there for like 15 minutes.
Yeah?
Oh.
Because, I'm just, I'm incredibly anal and an unbelievable control freak.
Well, I've never gone this fast before.
Hey.
Ross?
What?! What the hell?!
No, there's no dog here?
Well, then...Let's.
Thanks.
Yeah, what's your point?
Okay. Hey-Ooh, cool sheets!
Hey, oh, you know that guy who's been following me? I talked to him today.
Look, look!
Wow. So, okay, maybe that means that, you're not over Ross yet and you have issues with your father.
"No time for losers, 'cause we are the champions of the world...!" Thank you!
Alright, so that leaves Chandler.
I would, but you're the last one.
Well... no.
Be careful, be careful! These are my rat babies!
So how's your date with your cyberchick going. Ooh, hey, what is all that .
Oh, for god's sake, Judy, pick up the sock! Pick up the sock! Pick up the sock! I'm sorry, was that rude? Di-did my, my li-little outburst blunt the hideousness that is this evening? Look, I know, you all have a lot going on, but all I wanted to do was have dinner with my friends on my birthday. And you are all so late and you didn't even have the courtesy to call. Well, it's too late now.
Yeah, I don't know.
Oooh. Girl's night out indeed.
WHAT! WHY?
Oh that's so sweet thanks.
Hang on! Hang on! Hang on! Go!! Who's this? Oh okay, you're gonna like working for me. What's your name? What kind of name is Brendy? I... Whatever... Stop talking! All right, from now on your name is Joan. You can pick your own last name.
Hi!
I'm sorry, but sometimes they need help. That's fine. Go ahead and scoff. You know, there're a lot of things that I don't believe in, but that doesn't mean they're not true.
But, I need your germs! I want my cold back! I miss my sexy voice.
Turkey's are beautiful, intelligent animals!
Well, umm, my Mom's friend, Phoebe, is actually my birth Mom.
Oh, this is fun.
Or... maybe she has trouble loosening your knots because you're such a high maintenance tight ass!
Any chance Charlie has a deaf twin?
Oh my God! You got off easy! When my friend Silvie's husband said someone else's name in bed, she cursed him and turned his thingy green.
Oh come on, they can be in the same room.
Ooh! That's a good one! Mine is to pilot a commercial jet.
Ah!!
She died.
Rach, Rach, I just remembered. I had a dream about Mr. Geller last night.
Oh, I couldn't go in.
Come in.
Okay, so maybe you don't get her a ring. Maybe you-maybe you do something different. Y'know? Maybe you get her an engagement bracelet, y'know? Or an engagement tiara? Or-ooh! An engagement Revolutionary War musket! (Picks one up from the display in the corner.
Yeah, it's for our catering business!
Are you under the sheet?
Yeah! Yeah! Convince her that-that you're scared of commitment! Convince her that you're a little coward!
What?
Okay, this is from your friend at work.
Welcome back!
I don't know! I don't remember!
It's interesting that you lost. Now, I forget, do you like to lose?
Why would you start again after chewing all that quitting gum?
Alright, here, you have to hold this.
Do you have my birth certificate?
Is there anything we can do for you?
Hey! Hi!
Well, I mean, I'm not my sisters, you know, whatever, and um... I mean, its true, we were one egg, once, but err, you know, weve grown apart, so, um... I dont know, why not? Okay.
Um, that's really your decision, I mean, some people prefer, you know, to take off...oh whoops! You're being naked!
Well, what you're wearing is fine for that.
Oh, my first massage today is this incredibly gorgeous guy, and every time I see him I just want to do things to him that I'm not allowed to charge for.
Well, it's not so much that you know, like I don't believe in it, you know, it's just...I don't know, lately I get the feeling that I'm not so much being pulled down as I am being pushed.
Hi.
How do you even know a woman like that?
It's me. It's Phoebe. Listen there's something in here I want to eat, what-what smells so good?
Hey!
You don't have to put a good spin on everything.
nothing, I'm excited about our date, Mike this is Ross Geller this is Mike Haaaaa.
Thanks a lot! I just got that jerk out of my mind!
OK, look, see, this is him. My mother gave me this picture before she died, same guy.
David?
Oh really. Okay. let me ask you something. Yesterday at the coffee house, I went to the bathroom and when I came back, my muffin was gone-who took it?
Yes. But I left in the Ys. 'Cause, y'know, "sometimes y". Uh, I also have something else for you.
Hey everybody, Rachel was so good today. She didn't gossip at all.
Your secret bachelorette party...
Monica! That's not right! Start with where.
What is it?
I love the license plate game!
Mike, let me ask you something. How many sisters does Joey have?
You're not? See, that's why you're so great!
Yeah, I know. It drives me crazy.
Oh really? What was your first?
Ecoutez, je vais vous dire la verite. C'est mon petit frere. Il est un peu retarde.
Okay, look I-I-I do something nice, okay? I'll-I'll fill her ice trays.
Oh. Well umm, okay here's a weird thing. My mother was also a supply manager.
Of course not! And you're gonna love Mary Ellen. She's really smart and cute and funny, and I can't tell you how I know this, but she' not opposed to threesomes. So tell me some about my guy.
All right well let's see, Ross is a good father, but Joey has a boat-This is hard!
Oh hey, Monica, I heard you saw Donald Trump at your convention.
Okay quick, help me get this off!
Oh. Aw, forget it.
How do you feel?
Hey you guys! Look what I just got.
No-no, sorry. Cookies are good, thanks.
Come on! Look where you are!!
Yeah. What?!
Well, so do a lot of people.
You see? Nothing is good enough for her!
But I don't. Me, Phoebe.
I can't have any. You know I don't eat meat. Ohhh no.
You're not making the pies yourself?
And! She uses sex as a weapon!
No! I definitely don't wanna get married. No I just wanted to make sure you didn't want to too. Whew! Coz you know when we move in and you start changing your mind there's gonna be hell to pay mister!
Personal shopping? What is that? Like where you walk around with snooty rich people and tell them what to buy?
Oh, all right. Oh! Look what we almost took!
Damn it woman, pull yourself together! Have some pride, for the love of God.
Yeah, yeah. They even do you.
She's made it pretty clear, it is not going to happen.
You betcha!
Chandler what are you doing?!
Uh-hmm.
I can't believe it! I did it! I rode a bike! I never thought I'd be able to do that! Thank you Ross.
No, I want this to happen.
Oh, I'm Phoebe Buffay. I'm one of Ross's best friends.
We did have fun, didn't we?
Yeah, say my name. Say it! And now I'm going to cover you back up, and umm we're never doing this again.
Fine, I'll give you her number.
Yeah, no, Ralph doesn't look anything like that guy. He's-he's young and he's got long hair and a beard and a hacky sack.
What? Can't you see I'm in the middle of something? Ooh, I like it.
Hey! What do you have there?
Yeah.
You wanna work on your interview skills?
OK.
Um, cake.
I already had a baby. Leave me alone.
Okay. Do you guys want me to play for you?
So-so how long did that last for you and Chandler?
Yeah, why don't you just find another apartment?
It's Phoebe! Phoebe!
Well, what period is it from?
Why?
Oh God, I'm so glad you guys are happy, I was so afraid you were going to be all freaked.
What, so what are you gonna tell him?
Hi, Mike's place.
Yeah, not in your case Lovey Loverson.
No, 'cause she didn't tell me I was gonna die until the very end of the session, and I was not gonna waste a whole another hour there! I mean I've only got a week left, y'know? I've really gotta start living now! , leans back, and starts reading.)
Oh!!
You didn't get the money, did you?
Hmm?
Uh-hmm. Okay. Well then, could we reschedule? For say, Friday night perhaps at 8 o'clock?
Well, we both have.
Come on, like you never talk that.
They went in together. So sorry.
Oh, c'mon, like you tell me everything.
Oh okay, well I'm sorry to bother you. Bye-bye. Yeah you're right, this is easy.
Hey!
Well, at least you didn't rent yours from a store called, "It's Not Too Late."
Okay! All right, let's start with the handshake. Hi.
Will you excuse us, we need to talk for a moment.
Thank you. We both forgive you.
Or we could just follow your clever jokes &#150; any ideas? No! Didn't think so! Okay, c'mon guys, show us where the presents are!
I do! I do! I do! I do! Ugh, like I can really chase you. I'm carrying a litter.
Oui, bien sur je parle Francais! Qu'est-ce que tu penses alors?
Oh I do, it's.... it's Bob Saget. She hates him.
Wow! Oh you can just imagine that this is where they kept all the stuff to make their potions.
Oh, I didn't know you wanted her too!
Fine! Then you tell Roger because he was really looking forward to this!
Ugh! Women!
Where's Chandler?
Yeah, I've been around.
Oh, god, the last time I babysat them, they did the funniest thing..
No I-I meant your costume.
I know where Minsk is.
Break my heart-Oh, all right.
Oh, it's so pretty. This must have cost him a fortune.
Okay! Okay, ready?
It isn't?
Ooh that is definitely Chandler, Joey, or Ross. Or-or Rachel!
Ewwww!!
Or, or, y'know, um, 'I think we should see other people' means 'Ha, ha, I already am'.
Okay, I'm gonna go too!
Ok so will he be back soon?
Go for it.
Yeah, you can't do that! Oh, come on Mike, strap on a pair.Why don't you just tell her that we got back together. You know, women appreciate honesty. We also appreciate gentle spanking once in a while. Just F.Y.I.
How'd he take it?
Ooh, Joey, that's actually a really good idea!
So, how are things going with crazy? Has she cooked your rabbit yet?
Great, all right, okay, and Monica ask me to make the drumming stop.
All right, everyone calm down! Everyone calm down! I have something that I would like to say! Who here likes Ross? Of course you don't like him! He-he didn't give you any money, he raised his own hand when I asked, "Who hear likes Ross," and he's wearing two nametags! I-I'll be honest with you guys, when I first met Ross I didn't like him at all! But then once I got to know him I saw that he's really sweet and caring and very generous. I mean, all I'm saying is don't judge Ross before you get to know him all right? I mean, I like all you guys now, but when I first meet you y'know Kurt, I thought, y'know abrasive drunk, umm Lola, mind numbingly stupid! And okay, you guys Gold-digger, cradle robbing perv! So, I think you all know what I mean.
Y'know what Joey left on my pillow?
Oh right, yeah okay, my Mom could, and I can't. We don't have that....
I can't!! I can't!! Noooooooo!!!!!!! You son of a bitch!!!!!
Oh, yeah.
But...
We want the last six years back!!
Yeah, we went shopping!
So, I guess this is it.
Great! Okay, if you'll just excuse me. So, did you hear something you liked?
He seems to hate you. Are you sure?
Oh, totally. Oh, God, oh, she seemed so happy too.
So you do know who he is! Sorry.
I've never been more convinced of your love for her.
Ohh!
You don't play the oboe!
Uh, uh, gimme. Can you see me operating a drill press?
You're welcome.
No I'm having fun. I'm really-And I'm really-really excited for you and Ursula.
Well, if you really wanna know, I'm-Oh! I can't tell you this.
Hi!
No. But thanks.
Yeah! Well, I really liked that Lamaze class I took! Y'know and this time I thought I'd go for something, y'know a little more intellectual, with a less painful final exam.
Well, I-I thought a lot about what you said, and um, I realilized duh, all right maybe I was a little judgmental. Yeah, oh, but oh...
Yeah, I'm sure that happened.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm just a little nervous.
Oh really? She said she wants to go away with you?
No, no, it's not your fault. You know it's partly my fault, 'cause I made you quit cold turkey. Sorry, no. Okay, well, I mean, I can't date you anymore, 'cause your, you know Wow! But um, but I will definitely, definitely help you get over my sister. Okay, stalk me for a while. Huh? Yeah, and, and, and, I'll be like an Ursula patch.
I'll have one, please. Plus my money.
Aw. I'm just-I'm in a place in my life right now where I...I...
Monica, do you want us to take you home?
Oh no. No-no-no, don't do that! How could I live with myself if I knew I was depriving the world of your music.
- and there's five hundred extra dollars in my account.
Hey!
Now you know how you really feel about it.
I need to talk to you, it's pretty urgent. It's about Monica and Chandler.
She is gonna hate me.
Well, since the fire was kinda my fault I guess you should get to stay here.
You know he's gay?
All right, I've never been engaged and I've never really been married, but I can only tell you what my mother told me. Whenever you have doubts or fears or anxieties about a relationship, do not communicate them to your husband.
Uh-uh. Ok. What time is that.
No! No, that you and Rachel are engaged!
'Cause you're still into Monica. So you told her there was somebody else so she would agree to work with you, so 'cause you figure oh if you spent a lot of time together, maybe something might happen, and...
Really? Lee Majors is hot!
What is this?
Well I hope you have fun tonight.
Sure!
Good! Great! You can go first.
'Hi, I have Phoebe Buffay returning a page. Okay, well, um, she's in her car I'll have to patch you through.'
Oh, it's a key. To be honest, I think I'd prefer the five dollars.
You were?
Wow. What are you gonna use it for?
OK, that makes no sense. Why would the villagers worship a pharmacist?
Listen, I feel really badly about yesterday and I thought about it a lot and, and I know, I was too impatient. SO lets try it again.
What?!
Three months? Okay... This is probably none of my business, but uhm, how long do you think you're gonna keep seeing her?
Why did you go along with that?
I'm sorry, for the last time, why aren't you two together again? No, I know. I know, because you're not in that place. Which would be fine, except you totally are.
Yeah, I just don't buy it.
Hey.
No, we're late!
Awww! Now you're just my annoying friend Chandler.
What are you saying?!
So how's the piano playing going?
Oh! Yeah, this is fun, couples night.
I don't have to tell you everything!
W-w-I just-it's that-I have-y'know I have-I have an appointment. And it's very important.
Sure, yeah. I mean, it's Joey. I don't want him to get hurt. Well, I must say, I am on fire! First Chandler, now Joey!
Hmm, they just don't make 'em like that anymore!
Yeah, he's gotta go.
Of course you don't sweetie. You're brand new.
Oh.
OK honey, you're dating Ross.
And we did.
Oh no not that guy there. That guy right there.
Mike Hannigan... will you marry me?
Yeah, no, I'm fairly intuitive and psychic. It's a substantial gift.
Oh well, I guess Italian isn't one of the four languages you speak.
So how is this for our big double date tonight?
I really, really am sorry.
Oh yeah, oh and I know, but this isn't what it looks like, 'cause Rick is my ahh, husband.
Well, a palm reader, a manicurist, a hand doctor...
Oh. Ew! Ew! Ew! Ugh! Y'know what? This is too weird.
Do you like car games?
Oh!! That's my new thing. I figure bodies at peace, make peace.
Y'know Rach, I think that, I think you should be Monica's made of honor.
Okay, I will. This is my husband Crap Bag.
Wow! Okay, dude alert! And who is this guy?
Ohh, yes it would.
Jason?
Yeah we thought it would be nice to use the fancy china for dessert too.
So how did this happen? Did she, did she lure you to an early bird dinner?
OK. Smelly cat, smell-ly cat, what are they feeding you? Smelly cat OK, sorry. I'm just, I'm just not getting that everyone um, gets how smelly this cat acually is. I just think that maybe if we could talk about this, 'cause I need to feel that you really care about the cat.
Okay. All right you yellow-bellied-lilly-livered-DRAW!!
Yeah, I can't say that. uhm... Susie, I'm gonna be straight with you... Mike and I are back together... and uhm... unfortunately that effectively ends your relationship with him. And he's very sorry about that and wishes you the best of luck in all your endeavours.
Uh-huh.
Great!
Oh, well um, not right now. Y'know I'm just gonna go to bed, I think the fumes are giving me a headache.
There's sooo much you don't know.
Fine. All right, fine.
Ok, um, we haven't known each other for that long a time, and, um, there are three things that you should know about me. One, my friends are the most important thing in my life, two, I never lie, and three, I make the best oatmeal raisin cookies in the world.
What's your news?
Okay, umm, it's this tragic love story between Cathy and Heathcliff and umm, it takes place on like these really creepy mores in England. Which I think represents the wildness of Heathcliff's character. I totally get symbolism.
So... now... What about with Mike's mom?
You tired Chandler?
Okay.
Oh, and great! You might as well bring me my book, it's on the counter in your apartment.
Hey, so? Are you gonna do it?
Oh no! Why?
There you go.
Mike wins?
I can't believe this!
Oh Ross, hi.
Hee hee!
What else do they add smell too?
What are we gonna do? I'm starving.
Oh, oh, but y'know, you always see these really beautiful women with these really nothing guys, you could be one of those guys.
We ruined everything.
No-no!! No!!
I might have.
Really?! I won!
Y'know what? We thought you were different. But I guess it was just the coma.
I'm still looking through mine...
Ooh! We have a problem.
No, I'm fine. I'm great. I'm with you.
What are you saying I should do?
And I love Crap.
Yeah, okay. Hey, wait. Do you know what kind of birth control she was using?
Rachel!
This is Monica.
Okay, so The Plaza! Okay, we'll get us some Mai Thai's, maybe no more for you though.
Ohhh.
That's sweat. You throw up all morning, you'll have that glow too.
Don't feel bad. You know they used to like you a lot. But then you got promoted, and, you know, now you're like "Mr. Boss Man". You know, Mr. Bing. Mr. Bing, "Boss Man Bing".
Oh God!
Oh can I? Vegetarians never get to do the wishbone. It's really not fair either! You know, just because we don't eat the meat doesn't mean we don't like to play with the carcasses!
Yeah, oh, Princess Leia and the gold bikini, every guy our age loved that.
Wow! See, and I didn't think you'd be able to come up with anything.
Okay, so it's probably just the Ross thing then.
I mean I guess, I just have to... tell David that nothing can happen between us. Unless I don't... You know, complicated moral situation, no right, no wrong...
Oh wait, one sec. One sec. Hey you! Behind the glass! Who are you looking at! I've always wanted to say that when I was in one of these rooms, which was never!
Okay, bye!
No, but he's always late.
Wait. Why was he yelling at her? He's the one who slept with someone else.
You guys, why didn't you tell me you were eloping?
And why not?!
Guys, the drawing is about to start!
Oh yeah? Well, tell me which one, and I'll try slip it in my coat.
So how are things going with Paul?
Wrong again! Apparently you can change it to anything you want. So I thought, all right, here's an opportunity to be creative. So meet Princess Consuela Banana Hammock.
I don't know! I didn't come with her!
Yeah! It's so much better than first grade when you don't know what's going on and definitely better than third grade. Y'know with all the politics and mind games.
"Went to the store, sat on Santa's lap./Asked him to bring my friends all kind of crap./Said all you need is to write them a song./They haven't heard it, so don't try and sing along./No, don't sing along./Monica, Moncia, have a happy Chanukah./Saw Santa Clause, he said hello to Ross./And plese tell Joey, Christmas will be snowy!/And Rachel and Chandler, have err-umm-glander!!"/Happy holidays, everybody!
I know you didn't, I was talking about Monica.
You think you know me so well.
Y'know what? I'm not talking to you! You go back to sleep! And you, are you a rapist?!
Six months.
Yeah.
Nah. I kept myself busy.
And the big one's for me!
Well speaking of chiming in, remember the time you burned down my apartment?
So are you actually gonna see her again?
How can you come here?
Okay. I have just a few questions to ask so I'm going to get out my official forms. Okay, so, question 1) You and uh, you were married to Francis' daughter Lilly, is that correct?
Ok, somebody is on their way to ruin wedding okay. And I have to warn somebody, alright. So if you don't give me that number then I'm going to come over there and kick your snooty ass all the way to New Glocken..shire.
Yes, I did it!!! I nailed it!!! Yay! What's next?
I, I, I'm hideous.
No-no, I know that, but I just have to make enough money for the second part of my plan.
Yes.
where were you standing?
Oh, yeah, he clipped on, he said call him as soon as you get a chance, he's at Flimby's.
Why don't you hire him as an actor? You could have him dress up and put on little skits. Whatever you want.
Oh, it's so pretty. This must have cost him a fortune.
You could do that?
Oh, I see.
Uh-huh, yeah!
I just talked him into it, don't tell me I have to do you too. The puppet master gets tired people.
Hey!! The charity's on fire! Help! Oh good! Thank you, I need that. Whoa! What is that?! It's nine o'clock in the morning!
Two?
What stuff?
Really?
Okay, so what do you guys really think of Chandler?
Ok, how about... uhm... sex or dinosaurs?
Wow, eight hour flight with a one-year old? Good luck, mom.
Hey, what are you working on?
Yeah!
OOOOOHHHHH!
No I'm not. No! If anything I'm making you look better! They'll see you talking to me and that's--I'm a hit!
Morning.
Umm, I'm trying to move that pencil.
I know.
RACHEL!!
I'm so sorry.
Wow, a house for dolls, that is so cool! When I was kid, I had a barrel.
I'm not gonna. But you know what's cool though? Ok, if you had a friend named Pete, then I could say, 'Oh yeah, I know Pete, he's friends with my brother.'
Okay. Oh umm, Chandler, Monica is looking for you.
But, also, what happened between you and your Mom?
Oh y'know what's sadder than this? Bambi. I cried for three days with that movie. No wait two! Because on the third day my mother killed herself so I was partly crying for that.
I KNOW THAT!!! You have to stop her!! She's going to ruin the wedding!!
No, I'm fine.
Yeah, right.
You work with robots!!
Oh, that's great!!
Oh, okay. Hi new dad.
I do, he's been working on that all day!
Ok, so, ok, was he holding you? Or was his hand like on your back?
Okay.
Well okay, it's already February and I've only given two massages and they were both the worst tippers in the world!
Yes, I...I am with child. And I didn't want to say anything because it's your day; I didn't want to steal your thunder.
You know you should go outside and be with the three-dimensional people.
Ross, could we please, please, please listen to anything else?
Hey!
Toll-booth.
Wow, it's like a dirty math problem.
Monica, you don't know that.
Oh, ooh, Soap Opera Digest, oh that's one of my favorite digests.
Um, yeah, you want Ursula, and I'm Phoebe. Twin sisters! Seriously.
Oh, there's a cab! Taxi!! Good timing, my God, huh? Here you go.
No! No, her cab! She probably won't be using it; you can drive it to Las Vegas.
Hey, everybody. Happy Thanksgiving!
Where is everyone? They're forty minutes late.
I love you more!
Okay, don't sweat it. Chandler is nowhere around so go ahead get it out of your system. That guy's cute.
Okay.
Joey.
Garfunkle.
This stuff is great!
Hey, it's your Thanksgiving too, y'know, instead of watching football, you could help.
Oh, yeah, happy needless-turkey-murder day.
Hey, hey! Boo us? Boo you!
Yeah. I really like his glasses.
Wait! But Ross if they don't get along then you should smooth things over. Make them be friends.
ok.
Uh-huh.
No, uh-uh, I'm just, I'm nervous. So, you know what, maybe if I just, if I picture them all in their underwear.
Oh, I love paper mache! What did you make?
Not if you were here.
So, Sebastian, do you do any volunteer work?
Hi.
'Right, well look, um, if Joey loses this audition, that is it for Estelle. I don't care! Annie you are a doll, what time can you see him?' I need a pen.
Thanks. Hi, um, 'kay. I'd like to start with a song that's about a man that I recently met, who's, um, come to be very important to me. 'Kay.
They're gonna get through this, aren't they?
Oh!
You're-you're what?!
Well-well but it is huge.
Okay. Hey Mon, why did you tell the guys you weren't pregnant?
No way! No way! You just broke with Tag a week ago.
Oh, the Angelica!! Go! Go! You didn't get the annulment?!!
Okay, let's talk outside.
All right, the seven of us miss you.
Ooh-ohh!
Nothing! You have apologized to her like a million times and she's been nothing but terrible to you. And don't forget you just threw her daughter a lovely, albeit slightly boring, shower, and she hasn't even thanked you for it.
Well, I think my mother was too busy planning her suicide to provide saltwater treats. Thank you! So what, you're just never going to tell her?
Huh?
Will you get us better gifts?
Yeah?
Wow! I would trade.
Hey.
He's so funny!
I-I wanted to apologise if I-y'know seemed a tad edgy yesterday at my shower. Y'know it's just the hormones, y'know.
You ask us to find you a guy and you come traipsing in here with your own!
Have you thought about what you would be giving up? You can't move out of the city, what if you want Chinese food at 5am? Or a fake Rolex that breaks as soon as it rains or an Asian hooker sent right to your door?
No.
Unbelievable!
Ow! Ow!
I think she means 'You dance a dance class'. Oh, c'mon, c'mon.
What was that?
Yes, it reminds me of a simpler time.
That's so great! 'Cause you already know how to do that!
This is fashion?! Okay, so to you, death is fashion?! That's really funny. Here's Phoebe umm, sporting uh, y'know, cutting edge hairy carcass from y'know, the steal traps of wintry Russia. I mean, you really thing this looks good? 'Cause I do.
Didn't you two already talk?
Well, that could've been really awkward.
Yeah.
No you're not, you're wondering which cushion it is.
Uh-huh!
Oh please, somebody tell me I don't have to go to work today!
Oh! Oh! Oh!
Who's day just got better? CHANDLER!
Chandler, your being here is the best Christmas present I could have ever imagined.
Prove it.
Okay, ask her 'What is her current method of birth control?'
Oh, look, he's closing his eyes again.
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't hear you over all the winning.
And this?
Oh Joey, we've heard the specials three times! Okay? There's prime rib, mahi mahi, and a very special lobster ravioli.
Terry's a jerk, and he won't let me work, and I hate Central Perk!
Yeah, if you get married in Vegas, you're only married in Vegas.
What?!
See, this is exactly what we do not have time for.
Yeah, y'know, people can be so self-involved.
Two weeks? That's it?
We're just celebrating that Joey got his health insurance back.
Hey.
Would you stop already? Get out of the bitter barn and play in the hay.
Well, I'm ready to get the hell out of here! Oh. Are you? Are you?!! Ohh! That's so great!! Ooh, not for Bonnie. But for you, yay! Ohh.
I will replace it, I promise. I feel so terrible.
Oh, this is so nice. Alright I have to make a speech. I just wanna say that of all the guys that Monica has been with, and that is a lot, I like you the best.
You're right. You're right, he's just embracing life. We could all stand to be a little more like Parker. You know what? I am like him! I'm a sunny, positive person.
Yeah, it's in the guys' apartment under the sink. Why?
We have got to get you lazy boys out of these chairs.
I'm, I'm freaking out! Monica kinda trusted me with something and she shouldn't have! All right, I haven't lived here in a while, so I have to ask you something. Does Monica still turn on the lights in her bedroom?
What is that sparkly thing?
Yeah. I just need you to bring me some photos of Ross.
Oh, look at these! Hey, Ben. Just do it. Oh my God, oh, ok, was that too much pressure for him?
Oh, well, see, there's this guy she met at the...
Oh, I'm just so exhausted from dragging around this... HUGE engagement ring!
Ok, there is no top. That's the beauty of Smelly Cat. Um, why don't you just follow me?
CHANDLER AND MONICA!!!!
Oh wow, three hours and still no baby. Ugh, the miracle of birth sure is a snooze fest.
What?
So... What's the deal with umm, you and Joey?
No, it's positive.
Thank you.
Thank you, Monica.
Monica- Hi! Um, Monica, you're scaring me. I mean, you're like, you're like all chaotic and twirly. And not-not in a good way.
Oh!
It's, yes, my little black book. It's got the numbers of all the guys I've dated.
No, you can't let this stop you from getting massages! No look, I have, I have lots of clients that make the same noises you do!
All right. Well, don't worry, I call shotgun!
You're the cook! With out you it's just me driving up to people's houses with empty trays and asking for money!
You know, did you ride mopeds? 'Cause I've heard... ... oh, I see... it's not about that right now. OK.
No.
Please! Please! Please! Please! Oh please! Please! Please! Frank and Alice asked me to baby sit the triplets and I'm nervous 'cause I've never done that before by myself!
Wow! This reminds me of the time when I was umm, living on the street and this guy offered to buy me food if I slept with him.
No thanks, I have a good one too. I just, I, I can't see him.
OK. Smelly cat, smell-ly cat, what are they feeding you? Smelly cat Oh woah, oh my God. I mean like, who was that?
Oh, hey, Mon, do you still have your like old blouses and dresses from high school?
Why? Just 'cause you're too lazy to get up off your touchie?
Hi!
Marcia and Chester are mad at Phyllis.
Ooh! I know what you could make! I know! Oh, you should definitely make that thing... you know, with the stuff? You know, that thing... with the stuff...? OK, I don't know.
No. It's all right; it's probably false labour. They said that, that can happen near the end, just somebody get the book.
No!!
Ok, good! You guys were so scared! There was no way I was gonna dump this... Oh God, no! I think I broke your bowl.
Ohh knockers will help us figure it out.
Earl, you're not hearing me! All I'm saying is that you're not alone all right? Everybody hates the people they work with!
Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs!
Rachel said that!
Oh, well hello there.
Bye you.
I can't believe you... ..did this.
Hey Mikey.
Oh my God, they took my idea!
I can do that for the kids.
It's locked.
I really, really enjoyed it. Very exotic.
Phoe-Be.
You just abandoned your whole belief system. I mean, before, I didn't agree with you, but at least I respected you. How, how, how are you going to go into work tomorrow? How, how are you going to face the other science guys? How, how are you going to face yourself? Oh! That was fun. So who's hungry?
There was a girl, we'll call her Betty, and a guy let's call him Neil. Now I can't stress this point too strongly, this story isn't real. Now our Neil must decide, who will be the girl that he casts aside. Will Betty be the one who he loves truly? Or will it be the one who we'll call Ju...Loolie? He must decide, he must decide, even though I made him up, he must decide!
Who? Who is it?
Well look, if I wanted to see a fireman, I would date one. Okay?
Wait a second! This is about the fourth month of your pregnancy, right?
Oh, you say someone's name enough, they turn around.
Okay.
Ohh! So you're 5639?!
Well, mine was worse than that.
Oh, I would love to have kids. . . you're, you're the, you're, me play the songs that I will write for them.
No...
Three hundred dollars, are you kidding?
Hi! Okay, Monica, Rachel, this is my friend Roger.
You're there!
I know. Then, I'm gonna marry Chandler for the money and you'll marry Rachel and have the beautiful kids.
Ooh, ooh! Why don't we invite her?
I sleep with him!
Where were you?
I don't know. You could tie her up, she could tie you up; you could eat stuff off each other...
You're not serious, right?
Yeah, you're right. How's the Mrs.?
Hamburger. McDonald's. Old MacDonald had a farm, my dad is a pharmacist.
Huh?
Sure it does. Yeah, yeah.
Hi!
How many beeps?
Ooh! That's so nice...
Oh! I though the pot stickers were supposed to be vegetarian!
Now, that's trash. Young lady, you can't... Hey! Stop that young lady, she donated trash!
Why?
Well, she's out of town so, there's gotta be something in her house that tells me where my Father is.
Ohh, I'm getting too pregnant for this, lugging around a stupid massage table. Y'know, I have to find a job where I carrying a smaller table.
Great! Okay, good for you!
Well I'm sorry, I thought you said it was okay.
Gum!
Oh yeah you were helpful! Yeah, no, thanks you.
Joseph! Thou needn't worry, they shan't be long.
Maybe your resolution is to not make fun of your friends, especially the ones who may soon be flying you to Europe for free on their own plane.
I'm starving. I know we were coming here tonight, I ate nothing all day.
What?
What about Glen? He could be a Glen.
Woo-Hoo! The curse is broken! I called everybody I know, and everyone is alive.
May I ask why?
Hey!
Hey!
What is that?
Yea. Can I please, please, please talk to one of the best men? This is going to be the last time I promise.
Okay, fine! Fine! Mmm...hmmmmm....
You guys, he's beautiful!
Anyway, OK, now promise you won't like, freak out and say how great this is until I'm done, OK.
Whoa, that's a lot of stuff.
Y'know, for once, I am going to sit down and try to watch one of these things. .
Hey!
Well, if you're having a hard time, you should talk to my friends, Bill and Colleen. They adopted a kid. I'm sure they'd help you.
Good for you!
Secret affair!
I think she took it pretty well. You know Paolo's over there right now, so...
Check it out! Cup hat! Cup banner! Cup chandelier! And the thing that started it all, the cup!
Hey.
Oh my God, she's so stupid!
Aw, dammit!
I can see that, 'cause they both have those big brown eyes and, ya know, the little pouty chin.
Hey!
OK, who is the boss of you?!!
Nooo!!
Uh-huh, well! But umm, still I'm-I'm mad at you.
Hey, tell him about Relaxi-Taxi, and-and ask him if he thinks that's better than Relaxi Cab.
Chandler?
Uh-huh.
What make you think I can?!
Where? Ooh, come to Momma.
Oh, you're right! I was just kidding about Rachel. Babysitting is a gas!
If you had to, what would you give up, food or sex?
Alright, what are we gonna say?
Wait! Wait! Hi! Listen, Ross can I just talk to you for just a second?
Yeah, I know, I do that 'cause it makes me look taller.
Yeah that's right Chandler does still think I'm pregnant. He hasn't asked me how I'm feeling or offered to carry my bags. Boy, I feel bad for the woman who ends up with him. After you of course.
Yes, you do. Chandler loves Kathy.
Okay! It's worth it, if it will get you moving. You haven't worked in months.
Don't even get me started on yours!
For how long?
Don't take that tone with me. Who you think you are? Alan Lemond, the first black man to fly solo across the Atlantic?
Oh, okay, you're not a pushover.
No.
I don't want it to end either.
Well, OK, the record company sent over this piece of paper for me to sign, saying that it's OK for someone else to sing for me. That was my first clue.
And you... Your home is lovely.
Oh yes. Oh and, the part about how they're always like drinking from out pool of inner power, but God forbid we should take a sip.
Yeah, I can see where I'd be your best shot but, no. I'm sorry, but I think it's twisted.
Yes, I do! Today is Mike and my one-year anniversary.
Oh, wait, wait. Clogs, or claws?
Fine! Be murky!
John?
I'm sooo sorry!! I just... I keep thinking about Mike! I'm crazy about David, and we're having so much fun together. Why-Why do I miss Mike? That's-that's gonna go away, right?
We have good news, look whose back!
Okay, so... allright... Which dress? You can say "neither".
Oh, how do you play the shadow game?
Where's Chandler?
Monica.
Okay. Oooh! Oh, this is our last huddle, yeah.
Really?
Wow! Nice! Manly and also kind of a slut.
Thank you.
What?! He was with her when he wrote this poem. Look, 'My vessel so empty with nothing inside. Now that I've touched you, you seem emptier still.' He thinks Monica is empty, she is the empty vase!
No. I'm sorry. It's just 'cause I couldn't be there. 'Cause all I ever get to do now is pregnant stuff, it just bums me out.
Oh did you-what did you-did you work for two days straight?
Russ is Ross. Russ... Ross!
My Father is Chuck Magioni?
Hey listen let me ask you, do you believe in soul mates?
But really, it does seem like this money could be put to better use?
Ok, all done.
What is this obsessive need you have to make everyone agree with you? No, what's that all about? I think, I think maybe it's time you put Ross under the microscope.
Hey!
Okay!
Well, if she isn't then cremating her was a big mistake.
You are just like Jack.
Okay. Umm, oh! Okay, I see a circle.
Oh wow, ooh! Ooh, big step for Phoebe and Mike.
Great! Ok...I'll go get the tube top.
Because I'm normal! That was the one legacy my grandmother left me, and I know you wanted it as an engagement present.
Yeah, I see what you mean. By the way, nice Ross imitation.
Okay... Okay.
Hey! Do you want do you want a little taste of Pheebs?!
Okay, scarf's done.
Yes, and apparently he is married to some singer, but he said he would leave her for me. And I said, "James, James Brolin, are you sure?" James Brolin said...
Just get your nails done?
Wrong? Really? You know the word wrong. Everything isn't perfect? Everything isn't magical? Everything isn't a glow with the light of a million fairies? They were just brake lights, Parker!
Ok, ok, so how should I do it?
No. No. It's just I was umm, I was with Ross and Jill after you left and umm, I'm pretty sure I saw a little spark between them.
Ohhh.
Oh, anyway, they say, if we want, we can see it tonight.
I was preparing you for my-didn't you think I was dead? Did that not come off?
No, no, I'm fine, and y'know why? 'Cause of all the riboflavin.
Oh this, well I'm glad you asked. Now, don't you hate it when you have to cut a tin can with an ordinary steak knife? Ahh! Now, I know what you're thinking...
Oh, he's at the doctor, he didn't poop the whole time we were there!
I'm, I'm breaking up with you.
So uh, now look at the picture...
That is brand new information!!
YOU KNOW?!!!
I didn't know Playboy prints jokes.
Okay y'know what you have to choose. All right, if-if the most important thing on the planet to you is this cat poopy thing then, okay you can have Smelly Cat, but we won't be partners. So what's it gonna be?
Oh, this is my friend Roger.
What?
Y'know what that means?
Yeah. Yeah, that's what you need a good...pill.
Yeah, I should probably take it back. Ooh, but you know what? While I'm at the police station, I could check their Ten Most Wanted lists because my friend Fritzy has been like number 11 forever, so this could be her year!
Ooh, I like cards.
You guys, I'm sorry, could you please talk a little slower?
Your own boat?
Okay, yeah well, good news, you're going to have three babies.
Okay, now you're just kinda tidying.
Yeah, just, okay, look I'm going. Um, come on. Op, op, behind the pillar, which way am I gonna go?
Monica!
Oh, Pervert Parade?
What?!
What?! Well he never said that to me!
Why don't you turn them inside ou...
I have quarters!
No you can't quit college! No! You're in college? Really?
I just-I thought you guys were doing it, I didn't know you were in love!
Oh, yeah, um-mm. Oh!
Ah-hah! At least we know it's a him.
What are you gonna name the baby?
I..., a jingle? No, no-no-no, no.
Well, why did you make like a whole big thing out of y'know, everyone has to hang out in the big apartment?
I have new respect for Chandler. All right everybody! It's time to open the presents!
It's ok. I thought of the perfect lie for you. It's easy to remember and doesn't invite a lot of questions. You weren't at the parade because you had a family emergency.
But great news about the apartment pants, huh?
Yeah? And, he's-he's so centered and mature and confident.
Well then, you should look with us.
There he is!
You are useless! Freaking out about commitment is the one thing you can do! The one thing! And you can't even do that right! God!
There you go!
That's true. Well, is anything you told me about yourself true?
Wow you guys got a hospital? Fancy!
My sticky shoes, my sticky-sticky shoes, why do you stick on me, ba-a-by! Thanks for the lights honey.
I, but you're so close! No!
.and I said Vicrum you can't just call every time you get lonely you know, you, you gave up that right when you slept with Rachel.
Yeah, yeah! And you can get rid of that French poster.
Thank you.
Aww, good. What?
What stuff?
All right.
Why not?
I did not see that coming.
Get out of here you lurker! Go on! Get!
Okay! Okay! I'm so glad you're here.
Oh, is this the bug lady?
Yes! Your honor?
Yeah, I talked to my grandma about the Old Yeller incident, and she told me that my mom used to not show us the ends of sad movies to shield us from the pain and sadness. You know, before she killed herself.
Hey, and then lunch.
Wow! Oh my God, well if they've ripped off our table ours must be much more than one and fifty dollars!
Mike doesn't ever wanna get married.
What? Oh. Ooh. Whoa! That one kept going.
I don't know. I haven't been out on a date in so long.
I'm sorry too...
Well, freaked. 'Cause it turns out that the odds are really sucky. And! This is Frank and Alice's like only shot. Like, they are literally putting all of their eggs in my basket.
No, as soon as something opens up we'll move right in. Unless it doesn't have a pool, I need a pool.
Or instead, maybe you could just not marry my brother Frank.
I know no, no, y'know you don't deserve this, you don't Ross. You're, you're really, you're so good.
Okay, don't panic. I'm gonna go to the store, I'm gonna get you another set of nails, no one's gonna know, and you're gonna look great. Oh! Oh, it's 'cause they're gonna eat-that's the problem.
Ahhh!!
Okay, well... guys?
No reason, it's just I know a single guy that cares about other people.
Umm, okay I would like to talk to you about your toner needs.
I'll go with you
Oh, well, don't tell me you want to keep more of your stuff in my uterus.
Yeah! How would you like it if I sent you to Lee Majors' house and told you that he liked you, and you went down there and you found out that he didn't like you? How would you feel?
Guess what? You're almost an uncle!
Yeah!
Thank you Rachel but, look at Monica!
Hey!
Because you are so afraid of commitment! You talk to him, make him scared like you! Make him a...man!
Don't make me do this again, I don't like my voice like this.
Open bar!
Okay!
Yeah, but then I can be you sidekick Vunda.
No, actually I don't eat...
Everything you've heard is true.
I love this game!!
Listen. Listen. Smelly cat, smelly cat, what are they feeding you?
Okay, get out of my kitchen!
Well, I'm returning a call from a certain mom at the B-E-A-C-H. I just spelled the wrong word.
Yeah but if we throw her a party on her birthday, then it's not a surprise.
Aw, honey it's not your fault, y'know this is who you are, and I love you, and I want us to be friends, and if I keep living here I don't see that happening.
Okay. Okay, let's say I bought a really great pair of shoes. Do you know what I'd hear, with every step I took? 'Not-mine. Not-mine. Not-mine.' And even if I was happy, okay, and, and skipping- 'Not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not-mine'...
Hey!
Okay.
Ooh, it's sympathy pains. Ohh, that's so sweet!
Oh.
My God, I can't get a minute of peace around this place.
I-I, came to fill your ice cube trays.
Oh, no, I have the cutest Christmas story!
All right, so, what are we supposed to call you?
No, no-no, she was a human lady. This is the spirit of my Mom Lily, the one who killed herself.
Definitely!
That is so great! Oh, I... Oh my God!
Hm huh, yeah.
Ooh, good, you're hear! Okay.
Tomato tart and which of the pastas would you recommend?
Not Joey.
Ewwww!!
would you call this girl? thanks-fo-r-a-love-ly-even-ing.
Hey! Ross!
Yeah.
See? Vegetarianism benefits everyone.
Hold me close, young Tony Dan-za.
Because you would rather live here with Joey.
Roll playing... You could be the warden; she could be the prisoner. You could be the pirate; she could be the wench!
There isn't time. You must leave everything. They'll take care of you next door.
Look, he gave me his night vision goggles and everything.
You mean the one that my grandmother made me swear on her deathbed that I would never let out of our family?
You told me.
Hey!
Alright, I'm sorry but these people needed me. They work hard all week, it's Saturday night, they deserve to have a little fun. Go.
Will it? Will it?! I mean, how would you feel if you found out you were 31?
Okay, good. There you go. Doesn't anyone feel better?
Umm, Joey, I know.
Yeah, you don't wanna live in Westchester. That's like the worst of the Chesters.
Yeah, she came all the way back from Ross' building. Oh, the things she must have seen! And then she climbed up the fire escape and she tapped on the window with her teeny little paw and then we ran to let her in... I went to far, didn't I? When should I have stopped?
Okay. No. But thanks.
Horseback riding?
Here.
yeah I've nothing to be ashamed of ok so I haven't been in a relationship that lasted longer then a month. Ok I haven't had a real boyfriend you know if he can't handle that he can leave. which he will and that's ok. so I'll just be alone forever you know alright I'll be. it'll be fine. it'll be fine. I'll go walking tours with widows and lesbians. Oh.
Exactly! Look, no matter what I tried to do, I couldn't keep you out of my life. Of all the people I have cut out, you were the only one who ever clawed her way back in.
You make up songs?
So good!
Ohh, sleep with Kenny.
No, she just died today! Okay, umm, we're having a memorial service tomorrow.
You said it was okay!
You don't have any other choice!
Or, we could not tell them we know and have a little fun of our own
What about her whining and her constant need for attention?!
Oh my God! Dizziness, nervousness, drowsiness, facial swelling, nausea, headache-Headache. Vomiting, stomach bleeding, liver damage! Now okay, I don't recall any of this coming up when you gave me these little death capsules! Oh I'm sorry, extra strength death capsules!
Here.
Hey.
Listen if you wanna go, just go.
Yeah, but you always say that.
Hey, look who's up! How do you feel?
What about, what about when I said y'know about the apartment pants, how dumb was I?
It's not even that. I used to do my songs because it made me happy, but now it's like, it's just all about the money.
Very good handshake, good wrist action.
Happy thirtieth birthday! Here! It's for the child in you, and the woman. Happy thirtieth!
I thought I was going home to go to bed, but I'm sensing there's something less fun for me to do here.
Oh, yeah! Back then y'know, we called the Great War. It really was!
Oh, hi.
Okay, first I'm not crazy. And second, say it don't spray it. Anyway his name is Malcom, and he wasn't following me, I mean he was, but 'cause he thought I was Ursula, ick. And, that's why, that's why he couldn't just come up and talk to me. 'Cause of the restraining order.
Okay!
Okay, great so do you want to do it together?
Yeah, except your breasts look kinda small.
I stepped in something icky.
Okay, so now they know that you know and they don't know that Rachel knows?
Yeah? Well this is not what I ordered.
Oh, some guy she met at the movies.
Wrap it up, wrap it up, wrap it up...
Hey hey hey! She's on!
Mr. Bing's office. No I'm sorry, he's in a meeting right now.
For what it's worth, we would have caught her if we were at the right airport.
Umm, do health inspectors work on commission?
No, don't-don't say I'm sorry with porn!
The exclamation point in the title scares me. Y'know, it's not just Freud, it's Freud!
Let's see. Oh my God! Oh... But no! No! You can't-you can't hire him, because that-it's not professional. Umm, this is for me yes? Thanks.
Hi!
Dance karate?
Remembered what?
Yeah?
You guys?
Oh my God! Why would you play hide and seek with someone you know is a flight risk?!
No, it's fate!
Oh yeah-No, she was really nice to me, but she's in hell for sure.
What do you mean?
I did it! One mile on a hippity-hop! That's it!! That's everything I wanted to do before I was thirty. Oh, except I wanted to patch things up with my sister. But oh well. Yay!! And-and girls this thing is a Godsend if you know what I mean.
Well did she know you two weren't married?
How do you know?
Huh. Okay, Mr. Perkazet.
I'm having a really good time!
Yeah!
You guys! You guys! You don't have to fight over her anymore. Whoever doesn't get Gladys gets Glynnis.
Okay that's even sadder. Look, I know, I know what I got myself into, it's just that now that they're in me it's like, it's like I know them y'know, I mean-I mean, it's just not gonna be easy when these little babies have to go away.
Uh-huh. Okay. Okay, don't you think, maybe, though, it's just that he's so perceptive that it freaks you out?
Okay.
Oh, try and stop me!
Hmm, something bad to tell Rachel... Bad news for Rachel, what could that be?!
If you never smoke again I'll give you seven thousand dollars!
Maybe nobody's tried this.
Alright, well, maybe now its not okay.
Oh wait a second you guys...for the last couple weeks I've been that guy everywhere I go. We take the same bus. We go to the same bookstore, the same dry cleaners; maybe he's the tea guy.
Ohh, ohh.
Uhm, actually no. No, you've... You have to get off the plane.
Trick or treat!
Hey!
Oh that's my grandma. And thanks Joey she's having a really great time.
I can't! I can't! Unless... Well are you saying that-that you would move out if-if I didn't buy that lamp?
Hey! Joey! Hey! Hey!! Wow!
I was just being polite!
Okay then.
I'm in.
Wait!
Well, you know that psychic I see?
Oh! Ooh! Oh, I didn't know that you did...pot.
Oh! Since tomorrow. I met this really cute guy in the park and he like y'know, jogs, and blades, and swims, and so y'know we made a deal that's he's going to teach me all sorts of jock stuff.
You do?
Yes. We're here to make a rather sizeable donation to the children.
Okay, well I'll bring them by tomorrow morning. Okay, and uh, by the way, they're not actually puppies, they're Frank and Alice's triplets. Okay, see ya!
Yeah but the Swing Kings? Y'know they suck so much that people actually die at their concerts-They just stop living.
And a glass of tepid water.
My little brother's getting married!!
You're the most beautiful bride I've ever seen.
Because it was fate that made me call you today!
Oh yeah.
I'm gonna find a selfless good dead. I'm gonna beat you, you evil genius.
... with the double double double-jointed boy. Hey. So um, are you the professional guitar player?
Remember how you said you were really dense about poetry? Oh.
I ate a bug.
Should I not have told you?
Wait! This seat is really uncomfortable! Yeah, maybe before we start we should just get another one. Perhaps, like an airplane seat-or a beanbag chair!
It was the end of the party, you were probably ironing wrapping paper.
Absolutely! Y'know, you get this rush of feelings, but then it goes away.
You're thinking about this way too much. Just tell him and get it over with. It's like, it's like ripping off this Band-Aid. Quick and painless, watch. Oh mother of...See?
Yeah. What-what are you doing here?
You guys were right. He's just too excited about...everything. I mean I'm all for living life, but this is the Geller's 35th anniversary. Okay? Let's call a spade a spade this party stinks.
Okay.
Wow, I have the spirit of an old Indian women living in mine.
She was a drug dealer!
Well, I think it's great that the medical community is finally trying to help sick hamsters.
Where do you think Mike really is?
Okay.
What am I gonna do?! What am I gonna do?! I can't call my office they'll kill me! I can't call my clients they'll kill themselves! Great, now my chest hearts.
That's a, that's a long time.
Hey! What's up? Oh my God! What am I doing?!!
Okay, so I totally took care of the babies all by myself! I fed 'em, bathed 'em, and put 'em to bed.
Come where?
Hey, maybe they meant to write, 'Quiet, bitch.'
Hey you guys, Hums While He Pees just asked me out!
No, wait, oh, what are we sorry about?
You know if you want, we can sneak the dog back in and Chandler wouldn't even know.
Yeah! You're the best!
Oh that tart... floozy... giant...
Lather, rinse, repeat, and lather, rinse, repeat, and lather, rinse, repeat, as needed.
Oh, I can still do that.
Well he's tall.
Yeah. Let's see, my had Mom killed herself, and my Dad had run off, and I was living in a Gremlin with a guy named Cindy who talked to his hand.
Hi Joey.
I'm gonna get some coffee, anyone want anything?
Umm, look we don't, we don't really know each other so it would be really easy to just forget about this, but there seems to be something between us. And I don't know about you but that doesn't happen to me a lot.
Yeah! Sure! Yep! Oh, y'know what? If I heard a shot right now, I'd throw my body on you.
Really, can I hear some of it.
Wow, this is it, I'm gonna meet my dad. This is like the biggest thing ever, huh.
Well, yeah. Y'know, we were best friends, ever since we were little, our Moms worked on the barge together.
Oh my God!
And to knowing that your career doesn't mean everything.
Oh, I don't know. I mean it was fun one time.
I thought you meant in life.
Yeah?
Hey!
I'm a lady Monica, I don't kiss and tell. But this hickey speaks for itself.
I know, they're gonna be so happy together.
...and I-I can't take it! Y'know? I'm just, always afraid one of them is gonna catch me with the other one. It's making me crazy.
Ohh, well, you're my lucky penny.
Because she's your lobster.
OK so isn't there a little part of you that wants to get up there?
Sure.
So when, when do you leave?
Alright, so, can we turn this off? Can we just make it... make them go away? Because I cant, I cant watch.
No, Joey.
Yeah!
So, so far is this trip to Vegas better or worse than the trip to London?
Hey! Ooh, did you do it yet?
Oh God, this is turning into the worst wedding day ever! The bride is pregnant. The groom is missing. And I'm still holding this.
Just for some short-term-work. You know, until I get back some of my massage clients.
Wow, what is with all the negativity? You sound like Monican't , not Monican... ...Monica. Look, you know, you have been playing around with this catering thing for over three years. Do you want to be a caterer or not?
No. I've learned my lesson.
Oh, hey!
Oh, wow.
I don't even have a 'pl'.
Thanks you guys! Again.
Oh. Oooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! My butt cheek is waking up! Oooh! Ooh!
What's that now?
No, not wieght... y'know, more like insulation.
Oh Ross no. Be careful, that is very old! Okay? Early Colonial bird merchants used to bring their birds to market in that.
Hi.
I can't!!
Ooh, it's not bad.
Oh, no. Don't you hate it when people aren't there for you?
Come on, do it.
How could you not tell Mona that Rachel is living with you?
It's not a blue screen... it's just, maybe it was just really clear that day. OK, I have to talk to my grandmother.
Hellooo!
They're just talking, and y'know what? Just because I think they're soul mates doesn't mean anything's gonna happen.
Ooh, hey, could we put on the news? I think it might be raining.
Who's singing?
Eh, don't be so hard on yourself. If someone I was still in love with was getting married...
You know like... uh okay... uh... 'Could that report be any later?'
Oh my god. This is huge. This is bigger than huge. This is like, all right, what's bigger than huge?
Be cool! Okay lady, your lurking days are over!
Plate! Yes, plate.
All right. Ok, but, but! You have to promise that you will not be all like control-y and bossy and Monica about it.
Oh, I know. I could only think of two names, him and Ed Begley Jr. and then I remembered he's gay.
Um, not even a little bit.
Let's run towards them!
What else? What else?
I know!
Why do you think, she's having so much fun living with Joey?
Bye!
Ok, this is a typical lightning-bearer thing. Right there, it's like, um, 'Hello, who wants one of my fallic shaped man cakes?'
Well, how much do you think he needs?
Huh!
Yeah. Oh, that's gone too. This is Monica's bathroom right?!
Oh I know, I've been there. I remember toward the end...
God, I hope they kick his ass!
Right, like the kind you...
Uh-oh. She may be onto us.
Yeah?
Wow! Well, if you nail the interview, you'll get it!
Y'know? Ooh, you can almost smell the opium.
All right. Bye bye.
What?! No! It was my idea!
Today we're gonna start with some songs about barnyard animals. Oh, the cow in the meadow goes moo, Oh, the cow in the meadow goes moo. Then the farmer hits him on the head and grinds him up, And that's how we get hamburgers. Nooowww, chickens!
Oh.
Well I guess it's okay to open one more if it's part of a set. Y'know, it's probably this one.
What makes it pilgrim?
Wow! What an incredible violation-and wonderful surprise.
So Rach.
No, did we miss it?
Her name is Precious? Is she a purebreed or did you pick her up at the pound?
Oh, hi Chandler. It's Phoebe. Uhm... I know that Monica is working today so... ...I was wondering if you want to come to the movies with me and Rachel.
Hello. This is Phoebe Buffay. I was wondering, please, if-if it's not too much trouble, please, umm, might I speak to Miss Emily Waltham, please?
No that's just me coughing! Oh, good, there you are! Listen, um, I have a dog in my room.
Ooh.
Joey, why don't you talk to Chandler about moving back?
I know.
Hey!
Are you leaving "The Supremes"?
Embryossss? As in, "More than one?"
They found their bodies the very next day, they found their bodies the very next... la la la la la la.
Okay. Umm, ooh, ooh-oh, I have a game!
Yeah.
So how are things going with you?
You wanna be on my list too? Keep talking! Has anyone seem my list by the way?
Ok, so... 1800 minus twelve is... one thousand, seven hundred and...
I didn't say anything yet!
You heard her too?! You have the gift!
Ooh ooh, we have a live one!
Yeah. I actually am, yeah. Y'know life-life's gonna had you all kinds of stuff, y'know you learn your little lessons and hopefully you grow. Wanna hear a new song?
Okay. Okay, but you can't fire him today.
Um, yeah I guess that's me.
I know.
Umm, this stuffing is amazing. Do you think we should bring them some?
Oh my god, we killed Bob!
What?
David the scientist guy, David that I was in love with, David who went to Russia and broke my heart David!
See, that just means it's working. Does this hurt?
Really? Are you sure?
Which you just gave up really quickly.
Oh, you're such a cheater!
Oh yeah?
I'm still on "no."
We can't leave now! There was this one baby, Haley, who was favourite to win and she got croup, so she had to stay home! This competition just blew wide open, folks!
Yeah!
Drum roll.
You know, I think I want to write a song about all this.
Yeah, I feel great. 'Cause we're moving in together.
God! Ooh! What is that smell? It's coming from the bathroom. Ooh!
Could you-could you umm, give us one second?
Rachel, what the hell is this?!
I do too.
What? Oh my God!
Okay, it's in spasm.
Gosh. I'm not gonna let that man make you eat your baby. Oh. Hey! Who is that guy? I think I know him.
What the hell is this, herbal tea? I hate herbal tea!
I had nothing to do with it. Okay, it was my idea, but I don't feel good about it.
Hey.
You're not going?
Well this doesn't even smell like opium.
Ice sculpture? That sounds really fancy! I told you I just want a simple wedding.
Yeah, I don't need it.
Wher-where have you been?
uh huh how do I look.
Okay. Well there's one down.
Not for you.
Joey.
My Saturn dealership.
Oh, poor baby.
Uh-huh, uh-huh.
Now what is Fabutec?
Well, okay, fine, use my happy place. Okay, I'm just gonna, I have to ask that you don't move anything.
Just don't. Look at this funky shirt!
Thanks.
Uh-huh.
No.
Okay.
Yeah, so... They gotta die someday. HELLO!
Oh no, how?
Oh, okay. Excuse me sir? Could you come with me please? You have a phone call.
Okay, whatever. Y'know what? I don't have time have time to convince you because he's only here for four hours, and I'm gonna go see him!
No, answer his.
Oh, okay... good. You do that. And then when you get home, maybe there'll be a special delivery package waiting for you.
Is it Ross? It's Ross isn't it-Oh my God, it's Joey!
I'D Better Go. Just Over Here I don't want to miss the fight.
Why, do I have a feeling that's not as happy as it sounds? No! Nooooo!!!
Yeah, I'm a big surprise.
You guys, you know what I just realized? 'Joker' is 'poker' with a 'J.' Coincidence?
There you go! Oh, you are so lucky! You might actually get to meet Sting tomorrow! That's why you have kids!
Wow! I didn't know you guys actually used those.
Come on, Mom, I'll take you home.
That's all right, that's well, I figured....
There's a skylight?! Wow!!
Aww.
Oh wait, I change my mind! Okay, let's talk about the party! I have so many ideas!
Oh, is that you?
Fauna.
Shocking! Let's play the game of who can stay quiet the longest.
It's nothing, it's just- Okay. I'm going through my mail, and I open up their monthly, you know, STATEMENT-
Hey!
Ooh yeah! Then umm, what goes on top of the salami?
Easy. Step. How did it get on?
Shocking!
Oh! You have a window!
Noooo!!
Umm, where's my purse?
You are unbelievable! I spent so much time finding the perfect girl for you, you know. Mary Ellen is really smart and cute and loose.
Hi, Ursula.
It only takes two heart attacks to finally make you see.../One of them won't do it, but the second one will set you free.../Tell all your hate and anger, it's time to say good-bye.../And that is just what I will do, soon as those bastards I work for die!/La, la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la......
Okay. 'Jingle bitch screwed me over! Go to hell jingle whore! Go to hell Go to hell. Go to hell-hell-hell.' That's all I have so far.
What?!
No, no, no, I know, I know, ooh. 'Hi, this is Katelynn, from Phoebe Buffay's office. Um, is um, Ann there for Phoebe, she'll know what it's about.'
All right, I have ya. Oh God.
I'm just saying, this woman, I mean she's fictitious. No?
Oh.
He said that, um, he understands how sex can be like, a very emotional thing for a woman and he was just afraid that I was gonna get all, y'know, like, 'ohh, is he gonna call me the next day' and, y'know, 'where is this going' and, ya know, blah-la-la-la-la. So he said he wanted to hold off until he was prepared to be really serious.
I would love it. Consider it forgotten... But just so you know... however and whenever you decide to propose, I promise I'll say yes. Whether... whether, you know, it is in a basketball game, or in sky writing, or you know, like some lame guy in a cheesy movie who hides it in the cake.
Trouble?
Is it okay if I leave this stuff here 'til Rachel's birthday party?
Are you crazy?
Yeah. I'm Phoebe Buffay-Hannigan Banana Hammock.
Which proves that I never lie.
Ohh, that's too bad!
Yeah, no kidding, this just proves no good can come from having sex with Ross!
I don't know, he just started kissing me. Get him! Get him, Vince!
All right, there are no questions in the happy place. Okay, just, the warm breeze, and the moonlight flowing through the trees....
Hands.
Sorry, mix up. Hey, how was the movie?
Hey!
Aw, and I was gonna ask you to marry me because I forgot to say hello to you last week.
Mmmmmm! Everything smells so delicious! You know, I can't remember a time I smelt such a delicious combination of of, OK, smells.
Oh, you make sex noises when you get massaged!
Okay. See?
Ah, yeah, he's so adorable, God, he's just so much fun, Joey is the best, I'm glad you're having so much fun here.
Hey Joey, y'know what? You are way to good for her.
Well I have a video, you have to pay attention. No this, this voice woman, she's so talented but, according to the producer people, they said she doesn't have like the right look or something, ya know. I mean, it's like, she's like one of those an imals at the pound who like nobody wants 'cause they're not pretty enough or you know. Like, like some old dog who's just kind of like stinky and. Huuuuh, oh my God, she's smelly cat. Oh, oh that song has so many levels.
Oh my God! Chandler just left though!
Ear plugs, or cloves of garlic?
Well, umm, not much. But, I was just thinking that since those guys just got engaged that maybe it would be nice if they had some privacy, y'know? So, could I just move in with you for a couple days?
What is this? What's going on?
Rachel is one of my closest friends. Although, being the only one who knows anything about this does makes me feel special. Okay!
You told them he was missing?
Oh, whew, no, that's Bob.
Nothing. Nothing.
Hey! Ooh! How was teaching last night?
Oh! Ooh! Oh Monica! It's so beautiful.
No, I'm just gonna help him, you know, get 'de-Ursula-ized', like you know, like I did for Joey after he went out with her.
Oh, ok. Fine, I'll just, I'll take the hat back . Rachel: Hey, so you guys, the funniest thing happened, at work...
Mike and I broke up.
But you didn't give it to her?
No!
This is my father, this is a picture of my dad.
What'd I say?
What?!
But it's just so unfair that our date has to get cut short just 'cause some guy shot at a store clerk.
Ross, please! My make-up!
It's amazing! My headache is completely gone! What are those pills called?
Sorry Jill.
Oh, do you need a hug? You don't have to bring me anything!
My God! What did you order?!
Well, it seems like there weren't any tears 'til you showed her the bill.
It's just my knitting that's all! Yes! I knit this. I'm very good.
Works on you.
I could be a secretary.
Central... Park!
What?!
I'm on top of the world, looking down on creation and the only explanation I can find...
I sense these things. It was either but or butter.
Umm, you might even say that she pulled a Monica. She doesn't know we switched it.
You know, what I think is so great that you are totally into this person and yet for all you know she could be like 90 years old, or have two heads, or. It could be a guy.
Okay.
Whoo-hoo!
Alright, I can get you out.
That's too hard. Too hard!
Ah! Well! There you go! Last to know again! And I'm guessing... since nobody told me... this is Paolo.
Oh my God! David!
Oh, look, twins. Hi, guys. Oh, cute, cute.
Ok, ok, ok. Ooh, hey 'new doc on the block, Days of Our Lives' Joey Tribbiani.' Ooh, cool picture.
No, 'cause you just said dad and everywhere I go today I keep getting signs telling me to go see my father. Like when I was walking over here and I passed a buffet...which is my father's last name.
Come on Mon, let her throw the ball.
Ok, I just wanna be really sure this time. Andie McDowell's the girl from Four Weddings and a Funeral, right?
Well, same thing we did all day, hang out at Gary's apartment. He is so amazing, we never left the bedroom. But have fun at the movie.
All righty. I'll be back in-in a little bit. Unless you wanna come with me?
Ohh, he left his cell phone.
Not after this!
Uh-huh! I'm so...happy.
Or you could end up with everything.
Thank you.
That's really beautiful. What does it mean?
I don't get it.
Oh God. So-so you're making porn movies.
Joey, I can't believe you would do that for me.
Yeah... The woman you what?
No, it did not.
You wouldn't! Okay look, Rachel I know you really want to do this, but I-I've never been maid of honor to anyone before! And I know you've done it at least twice!
No! But it's the nicest kitchen, the refrigerator told me to have a great day.
So that's what you thought I did!! God! That's not what I do!
Hey, you're early.
I thought I'd try to take a walk. Would you pour me some water? I'll be back soon.
No! Wait! I was just saying that so you'd think I was a good person. Fight for me.
Ok, well, who identified the tone of this restaurant as pretentious comma garlicky?
Finish it!
Fine! I'll do it without you! I don't need you or anybody else! I'm gonna make it on my own! You'll see!! You'll all see!!
Je m'appelle!
I can hop.
Yeah, I understand.
Oh. What's a lurker?
A bunch of stuff. And the worst one... he wants me to get rid of Gladys.
I wanna get married.
Good!
This is so fun. All right, what do we do now?
Enh. Sure!
Yeah... And that physique! You must work out all the time...
Uh-hmm.
It's nice that he has someone.
Thanks, hi. Um, I wanna start with a song that means a lot to me this time of year.
Hey.
What's up?
Nope.
Oh, thanks. I couldn't uh...
Well, you could use your position y'know as the roommate.
Yeah Im fine.
Umm, Gene.
I think so too. And that little flap? Great for holding my lipstick.
No.
Oh he's like a...
Do the claws again.
Ooh, where are you off to, Travelin' Jake?
Wow! Nice! Manly and also kind of a slut.
You're not the only one who has a date tonight.
All right fine! This looks like so much fun.
What are you, what are you doing here?
Wow, cute one!
Of course! Yeah, I was uh, umm Thigh Mega Tampon.
Cabin of loooooovvvvve.
It's slang for pregnant.
Hey. What a day. I took her everywhere. The Museum of Modern Art, Rockefeller Center, Statue of Liberty.
Aw, God Ross. Oh.
Oh, it's your audition from this morning. Can I use the phone again?
Yes, we should. I think we should.
You think he's emotionally unavailable?
Ah-ha! A classic sign of love, the hug!
Interesting.
Ok, you can do this. It's just like pulling off a Band-aid. Just do it really fast, and then the wound is exposed.
Do it do it do it!
Um, well, get over it. So, I mean you, you just seem to be a really nice guy, you know. Don't be so hard on yourself okay.
17 years ago.
Oh, okay.
oh I dunno I dunno, you know I mean I like him but am I ready to take my grade a loins off the meat market.
Well then, what about you?! Huh?!
Thank you.
Hey. I'll be right back. I've got to go to the bathroom.
Well, yeah.
Yes that's right. But still, I-, look at your purse, look at your sweater, look at yourselves.
Yeah, and nobody slept with that Xerox girl.
Ok, who wants to hear something ironic?
OK, is this really my father?
Oh, because, you know... they don't like you.
Based on this play? ...Based on this play!
I'm sorry, Frank. I didn't realise things were so bad. You know, I'll help out more. I can - I can babysit any time you want. You name the day, and I'll be there.
We could not, would not want to wait.
Isn't there a national football league.
Oh, okay, I learned how to shoot a lay-up, a foul shot, and a twenty-three pointer.
Can I tell you a little secret?
Oh, she sees him! Oh, they're hugging!
I'll find Bob, I'll get him. Bob? Bob! Robert! Oh wait, I think I hear him. Oh - Oh my god! Bob had babies! Bob's a mom!
All good, thanks. Do you maybe have a nickname have like a nickname that's easier to rhyme?
Ross...
Are you okay?
Oh hey you guys!
Count for what?
Bye. Wow. So, that's great. You, Bill, Ross, and Emma are going to be so happy together. What were you thinking?
Oooh, I love family traditions like that. When uhm... when Ursula and I were kids, on our birthday, our stepdad would sell his blood to buy us food!
Great.
Okay, it's okay.
I cannot believe I can't find a selfless good deed! Y'know that old guy that lives next to me? Well, I snuck over there and-and raked up all the leaves on his front stoop. But he caught me and force-fed me cider and cookies. Then I felt wonderful. That old jackass!
How? How is your fault?
Monica! We lived together for years! I've seen you naked!
Who would you rather sleep with Monica or Rachel?
Ugh. Come on, Mona, don't kiss ass.
That man across the street just kicked that pigeon! Oh!
Yeah?
Ohh, the-the Foster puppets!
"You wish."
City Hall.
What do you think?
Oh, what beautiful lukewarm sentiment.
Okay, I would ring the bell to distract him and then I would knock the gun out of his hand with a Chinese throwing star.
Mm-hmm. Throw me a bone here.
All right. Hold on. I got it. Nickel! How much more do we need?
Yeah ok, well at least I didn't let some guy into the forest of my righteous truth on the first date.
Oh, yeah!
So how are things going with you two? Is she becoming your special someone?
Yes.
Eeeee--ohh!! God!
Hey.
Yeah, you too.
Yeah. Um... I'm out.
Okay. Oh! Oh no.
Okay, bye-bye! Good trip!
I'm sorry, okay, I-I wasn't looking, and the store says that they won't take it back because you signed for it...
Well, I've been reading up and for your information, minks are not very nice. Okay, I admit it! I love this coat! Okay, I-it's the best thing I've ever had wrapped around me, including Phil Huntley! Remember Phil Huntley? He was fine!
I don't have it!
Yeah, I don't eat that either.
Oh yeah, oh, she went to the salon alright...
Ok, ok, she's taking the trash out so I can get you out of here but it has to be now, she'll be back any minute.
Oh, thanks a lot. Do you want to get a cup of coffee?
And! Whoever finds it wins the prize!
Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew!
Hey!
well you not what you should feel terrible about, this could have been my serious guy he was sweet and smart and funny. Do you know how hard it is to meet a guy like that?
No that's what you do when you want to get the truth out of someone.
Uh-huh, yeah that's too bad. I really want to go to his concert Friday night, but it's totally sold out. I know! Why don't you meet him and get tickets?! If you get two I'll take you.
These old things.
Ok, it's too hard, I can't teach you!
Oh my God, you've got to stop chattering!
But-but you know you cannot get involved with your assistant.
Make sure you check Chandler's jewelry box.
All right. I'll do it, I kissed him before I can do it again.
We're all right.
Yeah, much better. And you know what, don't feel bad, because it's a hard song.
You know, now you're more like, you know like, "Mr. Caring Boss," "Mr.", you know, "I'm one of you, Boss," "Mr., I wanna be your buddy, Boss Man Bing!"
Ross, where did you get this?!
Absolutely!
I'd love to.
Yes, you're having a boy!
Ooh, what a great table! Where-where did you get it?
Yeah, it was really hard.
Hey.
Oh I-I don't know about that. No, I think that if the two of you had sex the-the-the repercussions would be catastrophic.
Oh, I'm sorry. Is that annoying? And speaking about being selfish in bed, how's Whitney?
Oh my God, so do I!
All the time when you're cooking.
No-no, that's not, that's not me Phoebe, that's her pal Phoebe. According to her high school yearbook, they were like B.F.F. Best Friends Forever.
Cool Aunt Phoebe. I am pretty cool!
Sorry.
Ohh.
Really?! I looked into that. Yeah, but, I mean it costs like $60,000 and y'know you can die. And, you would die!
What happened?
Yeah! In... really long hour world.
Sorry.
David's like, y'know, Scientist Guy. He's very methodical.
Not if I get there first.
: Your Visa bill is huge!
Oh no no.
Hi! Hi! Listen, my friend Ross is about to be divorced for the third time, but wouldn't you date him?
Well, he wants to do some ecclectic, so he's looking for someone who can, you know, create the entire menu.
Oh. Finally! Oh.
Hey!
Have you really done this before?
Guess we'll never know how it ends.
Um, perhaps. Yes! Yes, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I was just afraid that you were still hung up on my sister.
I don't ever want to see you again!
That's right, exactly. All right, it's a good bye kiss, that's good. Bye-bye. Okay, no, the important thing is that you see what I'm saying, y'know, just y'know, this is clearly wrong. Okay, I've decided I'm gonna let this happen! Okay, can I just get my purse? Okay, all right, good. .
No! I am a positive person. You are like Santa Clause on Prozac, at Disneyland, getting laid!
Yes, yes, and it's, and we always have to go to, you know, someplace nice, you know? God, and it's not like we can say anything about it, 'cause, like this birthday thing, it's for Ross.
Happy Christmas Eve Eve. Oh my God, where did you get this?
Uhh, I can't stop thinking about it. It's just so hard. I just wanna grab all these houses and rub 'em all over my body.
I think my boyfriend ever so dreamy, I wonder what our wedding's gonna be like.
Oh, how cute!
Well, he came in for a massage, and everything was fine until.
So, how does Mona feel about you and Rachel living together?
It's, I mean, it's nothing, I'm fine. It's my friends. They-they have a liking problem with you. In that, um, they don't.
Yeah?
Really?
Chandler, Chandler.
Why? Because she can sing and play guitar and do both at the same time?
I could do that.
No!
So?
Okay, okay. If I were omnipotent for a day, I would want, um, world peace, no more hunger, good things for the rain-forest...And bigger boobs!
What?
All right. All right! If he wants a date? He's gonna get a date. All right, I'm gonna go in.
So was it a lot more money?
I can't believe you did that!
'My scones.'
Well, I wanna enter her in a baby beauty pageant.
Oh, I am sorry but I am incredibly talented.
Bread, so you never go hungry.
Ooh!
But you-you can't leave me with them! We-we're a team! We're playing a zone! They're gonna triple team me!
Oh, there's no such thing as an innocent burger.
You don't know him. It's not important. He wants nothing to do with me or the baby.
You know that's... that's her.
Ooh, this is it, 74.
Really? So this is... this is my big send off in the married life? Rachel this is the only bachelorette party I'm ever gonna have! I've got a big wad of ones in my purse! Really? I mean, really? It's just tea?
Why? It's fun, it's different, no-one else has a name like it.
We're practically kissing.
Ready... GO!
Oh hey hi, he's doing it. He's breaking down the door. Okay, we're in.
You didn't say Boutros Boutros Gali.
Oh... Milwaukee.
Happy thoughts! Happy thoughts!
Oh, hi.
Rachel and Joey! It's Rachel and Joey!!!
Yeah!
Friends!
Y'know, I bet it would actually make my grandmother very happy to know that we're trying to figure out her recipe. I bet she's l-l-lookin' up at us and smiling right now.
The donation we made earlier, we k..., we w..., we want it back.
This pregnancy is throwing me all off.
And Tim I just wanna say, good luck here.
Not personal, really, well they said that they never met an Italian actor with a worse Italian accent.
