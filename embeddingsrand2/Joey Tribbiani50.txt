Well, I guess I could sleep with her... I mean, how could I do that?
We did it!!
Why would they take away our keys?
Yep.
All right.
Maybe, I should call this place and get them to put my 'Days of Our Lives' on here. You know, juice this puppy up a little.
Does that mean we have to bust it open?
Cool.
Listen uh, I'm really sorry, it looks like I'm gonna be stuck here for a while. I got the transmission fluid, but when I went to put it in the car, the transmission wasn't there!
Oh I am!
I know! It's stuck!!!
No-no, Kathy.
Yep. Ice Capades.
Can I ask you something?
Yes! Shame about you man.
I'm coming up!
I'll take it back tomorrow.
No I mean it! I can't believe they would do this to you! And to your fans! I mean they are going to be devastated! Heart broken! They love you so much!
Hi.
Wow! So, how are you?
Only if you think it's better than this... snow-in-a-can!! I got it at work. Mon, you want me to decorate the window, give it a kind of Christmas lookie.
Ew! What is that? Something exploded!
All right, I'm here, let's ahh, get this over with.
Of course! Only an idiot would wear this stuff if you didn't have the car! Right?
Oh wow! You can tell this soon.
Erica.
I know, yeah. I feel like we're all growing up. Person named Wiener, God that kills me.
Okay. Can I borrow 94 dollars?
You are not at Thanksgiving?
Okay, imagine the best sex you've ever had.
How are ya? How are ya? Where are your babysitters, huh? Why's the bedroom door closed?
Oh great. Hey! Go take off those pants, they look ready!
Well, they go into the chipper.
No. They really like me over there. They want to do a big profile on me, but I said no.
Yeah?
Alright, hurry up, you gotta do something.
What are you doing? I said seven! Argh!!!
Multi-colored robes! Ooh, and maybe a hat.
So? What-what-what happened?
I know, Monica told me.
Chandler, come on, you're gonna find somebody.
Not following you.
Uh, you gotta press the button.
But between you and Phoebe, I'd have to give the edge to Phoebe.
I can't find the remote. Thank you.
Y'know, Monica and Chandler are married. Ross and Rachel are having a baby. Maybe you and I should do something.
Don't worry, it's out there! I think I just need lunch.
Hey!
What are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing?
Just pickle.
