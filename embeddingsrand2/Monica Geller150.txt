Oh, why is it unfair?
Would you stop? We've only been going out a couple of weeks, I mean we don't even know if he's gonna propose.
I'll be coordinator! Oh my God! I'm so sorry, I didn't get you anything! Okay, look everybody has to help! Okay? You can help, can't you Phoebe?
Soakin' up all the culture.
Well you-you did start that rumor about Ross making out with Mrs. Altman, our 50-year-old librarian.
Toothpick?
I guess I wanted to keep it as a souvenir.
Yeah, I saw him waiting for an elevator.
So what happened?
Wow, really? One time he just looked at my bra and it popped open.
Let's go big bunny!
How do you feel?
Here, let me make the milk, I'm up anyway.
Wow! I Had no idea you had this much pride.
No, sorry.
What are you doing?
We owe you?!
I'm sorry I almost made you sleep with Ross.
Could you please tell me what this is in reference to? Yes, hold on. Um, they say there's been some unusual activity on your account.
I am not 'so'! OK, I was a teensy bit weird at first, but... I'll be good. I promise.
Rachel-Rachel-Rachel I-I cannot, I can't let-, actually I kinda want to see what happens.
What about the rest of Manhattan?!
So? What do you think of the house?
Okay.
Oh no, was I cleaning in my sleep again?
Y'know what really bothers me? Is-it's how-how different you act around them! I mean y'know the throwing the tennis games, the fake laugh, the "I'll see you around, Bing!" "Not if I see you first, Doug!" I gotta tell you, I don't like Work Chandler. Okay? The guy's a suck-up.
No! Wait! I think I can figure out the recipe from this cookie! I do stuff like this at work all the time.
Why?
Wow! It took you all night to come up with that plan?!
Whoa!
You okay?
Oh, good luck.
...And then we throw your body in the water... Gee, that does sound fun.
Oh, so you like her too Chandler?
Well?
Would you look at them?
What is it?
Okay.
Which one?
Well good, here let me help you out.
Oowww!!
I don't want to say.
Here's the plan! Okay? I'm going to leave you get a look at Brenda's bra!
Wow, all you need now is The Killing Fields and some guacamole and you've got yourself a part-ay.
Well, maybe the mailman liked the cookies, we just didn't give him enough.
Oh my god!
Well, thanks anyway.
Thanks.
Well that's the best part. Umm, you guys get to decide!
Who's that?
Alright, 5 more minutes.
Ok, I'll tell you what. How about I cook dinner at my place? I'll make it just like Mom's.
Think about it.
Quick, take off your dress, he won't notice the bed.
Well, we thought we would all go to a picnic , in Central Park!
Not a lot, Phoebe's kidding, Phoebe's crazy.
Alright, I'll be right back.
Wait a minute...Joey. Joey you can't ask her out, she's your roommate. It-it'll be way too complicated.
I can't believe we are at a real college party! I have to pee so bad!
Really?
Hey!
Hey!
No, that seems about right.
If you want, I'll do it.
What?
Phoebe, can I talk to you for a second?
Huh. What's doofus spelled backwards?
What are you doing?
Well umm, Chandler and I are moving in together.
Hey Pheebs, how's it going?
What are you talking about?
Phoebe, he's a friend of my parents. He's like 20 years older than me.
It's not a date, okay. I'm just gonna teach him how to make lasagne for some pot luck dinner he has.
Yeah. We-we had sex and then we fell asleep.
Hey.
Who are they killing off?
Well, she corned me! She asked if the wedding was in town! I mean, what was I supposed to do?!
Oh!
That's what you've been working on for the past two hours?!
Oh my God!
Y'know what? I'll think you'll play.
Oh wait, just one more thing! One more minute! Umm, you're a stupid bitch.
No, it's not.
Hey, where is everybody?
I just ran into Dave and he told me that you blew him off! I mean, you listen to me! Now, I'm calling the shots! I say you leave Ross alone and go get Dave! What the hell were you trying to do?
She's sleeping.
Phoebe?
Hey.
I knew it!! Y'know, you're not so quiet yourself, missy!
Hi! I'm Monica and I'm gonna be singing "Delta Dawn""Delta Dawn, what's that flower you have on? Could it be a faded rose from days gone by? ..."
Oh, I love this street. The trees, the big front yards, the actual picket fences.
So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks?
Alright, let me ask you this question: How many of you thought the music was fine, but not in keeping with the tone of the restaurant? .
Oh my God!
"Take me to the mansion in the sky-y". I am sorry, the song is over. Did you see me out there?
WE'RE GETTING A BABY!
You can not do this.
Hey.
What?!!
They're still in my coat.
Ohh, how is he?
I'd like to have Don and Phoebe over. Wouldn't that be nice?
Well Rachel's not here!
Oh my God! Chandler!
Thank you.
Damnit Phoebe! How did you even call him?
Promise to call me when you land.
Oh, good to see you too. Did you come down here to tell me that?
Hell, yeah!
I know! And four ninety-nine for a pillow top queen set, who cares about the divorce, those babies will sell themselves. And I'm appalled for you by the way.
So how was Joan?
You and me both.
What about your breath?!
Hey! It's me. Mon-i-ca! Can I just tell you how proud I am of you.
But what kind of a sick bastard wants to do it in front of a deer?
I know, but you have to open it today!
Oh, what about that guy over there? Remember? That is the guy you flirted with at the counter that time.
Hello, this is Monica... Yeah??? Oh... Okay, yes, we'll be right, we'll be right down. Thank you.
Yeah... yeah, I think there is. -What were you gonna say?
And now your cell.
No, but he told me, he thinks your a fox.
It took me 28 years to find one man that I wanna spend my life with, if I have to wait another 28 years then, I'll be 56 before I can have a baby, and that's just stupid.
That's right. I'm no longer a bride. I'll never be a bride again. Now, I'm just someone's wife!
Damn it!
Oh, my pleasure.
I missed this apartment! Now, this is a grown-up's apartment! Y'know, I-I should be with a grown-up, do you know what I mean?!
We don't have much time. Once the egg descended the oviduct ...
All right, we should call somebody.
Okay, what's going on with you?
That's right. That is right, you go over there and tell her you don't want her to live with you. Do not take no for an answer!
Hello? What?! You what?! Hey you listen here missy! Wh-
Hey!
Hey guys! You found the presents? Chandler, you let them find the presents? Great! Do you know how long it took me to find you that water purifier?
Okay, d'y'see anybody you think could be me?
Good. Okay, I'm just gonna wait for Chandler to open the rest of them.
There's still so much to do. Have you written your vows yet?
Yeah. I'm okay. I'm actually-I'm a little cold, can I have your jacket?
I can't believe you bought this.
Yeah.
Hello? Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Okay. I guess we can bet one more time.
No, it's more like a good luck.
And that's why, I'm not inviting you in for a drink. Bye.
As a thank you, Rachel and I will kiss for one minute.
She said WHAT?
Rach! It's me! Pick up!
Okay.
Uh, so, uh, Rach, uh... do you wanna save this wrapping paper, I mean, it's only a little bit torn... so are you gonna go for it with Ross or should I just throw it out?
So it's okay to date a student.
Oh, hey! Oh good, you brought food!
Hello? Oh, hi Wendy! Yeah, eight o'clock. What did we say? Ten dollars an hour?... OK, great. All right, I'll see you then. Bye.
