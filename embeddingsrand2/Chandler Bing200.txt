Hey!
Hey, Ben, remember us? Ok, the mole came off.
It's like 'Night of the Living Dead Christmas Trees.'
They're these prototype sneakers and come up with ideas on how to sell them which I can't do because no self-respecting adult would ever where these.
Mar-haaaan.
And the fireplace in the bedroom.
It's OK. It's OK. I was always rooting for you two kids to get together.
Oh.
From a bullet!
Okay.
Actually, uh, we're both the father.
Where's my seat belt?
No!
Uch, do you think, Monica is gonna be able smell it?
Sounds like a date to me.
Yeah, huh. I'm just uh, you know I'm just picking up some things for a party.
Petrie, right, right. Okay, some people gonna be working this weekend.
Okay.
Just one more thing. I was so pissed at you that night that I wanted to get back at you. So I thought, who does Ross like the more than anybody?
Bye, Pheebs!
God why why would you want to do that to yourself!?
OK Phoebs, how many do you want?
I'm not worried, I'm uh, I'm fascinated. Y'know it's like uh, Biology! Which is funny because in high school I uh, I-I failed Biology and tonight Biology failed me.
Joey, what-wh-wh-wha-wh-wha-wh-wha-wh-wha-what are you doing here?
Hey!
You need new clothes.
Hey, what do I know? I wanted to get a bigger gorilla.
Yeah, we'll be down in like five minutes.
Yeah-yeah, so big that it actually makes our doors look smaller!
No!
Bedroom. Bathroom. Living room. This right here is the kitchen, and thanks for coming by, Bye-bye.
Wish it! Hi. Hi, I-I was just sitting over there, and uhh, Chandler. My name is Chandler. Did I say that?
That sounds good. I'll call you- or you call me, whatever...
What do you mean, like, buy it together?
Woah, woah, I've put on a little weight?
Do not speak ill of the dead.
Hey man, how did the audition go?
Come on, let me see that smile.
Yes. When Monica and I were in London, we were both in London.
Yeah, I don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet.
All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring. Now I don't know what to do, everybody starts looking at me.
Can't believe you guys bought that, enjoy your slow death .
Yes, and while I'm doing that, Ross has a great computer story for you.
I don't think this town is big enough for both of us to relax in. Draw!!
Thanks.
Hey, look, Phoebe I wanted to meet her in person too, okay, but she's married, she has a husband.
No, no, no-no-no. I smoked for years, then I quit. Right now, I can't remember why. You're not allowed to smoke in this office. Not right?
Well, we're gonna... we're gonna figure this out.
You may wanna get some more of those too.
I haven't seen this dress.
Hi sweetie. So, what was with all the whispering?
Joey, this is Die Hard 1 again.
You know that's not the reason Joe.
Sure you do.
You mean like for award shows?
Yeah, and at the end of the play, he, he got up y'know, and he just started like, banging his hands together!
well, well, well it must be five in Tulsa because it's six o clock IN NY.C!
Oh, tell her good luck with that.
Alright, I hope you realize you're not getting these underpants back.
You told her?!
Hey, this isn't like swimming after you eat, pick up the phone!!
Yeah. I feel so bad. Is there anything I can do to make it up to you?
Yeah, I-I-I think so. Yeah, I-I think so...
Really? You're gonna be okay?
Like?
Don't look honey. Change the channel! Change the channel!
Oooh, Rich is goin' to the party too, huh?
No, he visited a little town south of throw up. So what was Phoebe's secret?
Okay.
Yeah, I understand.
You're naked in this picture!
Y'know? So I was thinking that we could get one of those signs and hang it over our bed. Because, that's you and I together! Merge!
Veronica. Look, it's got to be Veronica, the girl in the red skirt. I definitely stuck my tongue down her throat.
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
Well, it does not ring a bell with me...
No, did he hug you?!
There was no fish when she dropped it off.
I said, "Geez, relax Monnnnn."
Look forget it okay? I don't want to go. I don't want to see him. I don't wanna.
Let's do it, come on!
Yeah, now how's that going though? Are you okay with the not-flirting thing?
I messed up. Okay? I'm sorry, I really messed up.
No, no, this is the first time.
She'll love it. Go with the egg, my friend.
Oh, great. We have to watch him do yoga in his underwear, but for this he closes the drapes!
No, I just always see guys doing this when they get handcuffs taken off them. Hello sweet pants!
Off?!!
Almost over man.
I know!!
I know.
Go on.
But we don't know the neighbors.
What question?
I can develop a condition in which I talk and talk and no one hears a word.
Oh, really?
That's so cool. I'll let Monica know.
You got the lead in a movie? That's amazing! What's the movie about?!
Nah, Phoebs, that's the guy that comes in the frame.
You remember Janice.
Hey-hey, is Monica here?
Oh my God!
Take off your shirt!
Awesome.
What about that circled one?
Oh, thanks, but I think she'd feel like we're gangin' up on her.
Oh well, that's uh, a little later than I uh, generally care to stay, but sure!
The reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make a big deal out of it.
Stay out of my freezer!
Bad dream?
Ah sure. What's in 'em?
OK, well that's the part where I'm a wank. But I was hoping we wouldn't focus on that. Hey, c'mon man, I said I was sorry like a hundred times, I promise I will never take it off my. . . wrist. But if, if you want to stay in there and be mad, you know, you just uh, you stay in there.
Eight and a half hours of aptitude tests, intelligence tests, personality tests... and what do I learn? "You are ideally suited for a career in data processing for a large multinational corporation."
We have to leave for New York in an hour.
Yes talk to her. Be a man.
Oh, umm, Joey was born, and then 28 years later, I was robbed!!
Not to shabby, I got this all off myself...using my wife's tools. Oh my God!
Wow!
Yes! It's flown into your blouse and you'd better undo your buttons lest it sting you!
I'm just trying to help you out! Okay? I wanna make sure that you're okay.
Hey, look Joey, I'm just saying if you need something to hold you over, I can get you a job right here as an entry level processor.
You think?
Oh-ho-ho-ho-no! No! No switching! No sharing, and don't come crying to me! Ha-ha-ha! I may just sit here and have my cake all day! Just sit here in the hallway and eat my...
Oooh! I hope you're happy too, honey!
Theyre twins!
No! No, she didn't say that. I-I-I think you should talk to Monica now.
Treasure of the Sierra Madre!
Where's Emma?
Atlantic City!
And it's not as if you have a boyfriend's shoulder to cry on.
Oooh, I'm afraid that does not exist.
YOU NEVER DID IT!
Well, thank you for lunch.
Had the money in the wrong hand.
I don't know. Maybe we can open this up somehow.
Hey, it's Janice.
We're the Bings.
Really?
When was the last time you saw her wear it?
Hey!
No, I can't. No-no, listen, I, I know how much this means to you and I also know that this is about more than just jewelry, it's about you and me and the fact that we're best buds.
Am not!
No ah, hold on a second Joe, where do Dutch people come from?
Ya know if you want to, I can just hold them down and you could .
Look you have to help me out here. I thought we had a deal. I thought by the time...
Hmm.
Oh please, I saw the way you were checking out his mouldings. You want it.
Wait. Before we go in, I just want you to know I love you. I had a great time on our honeymoon, and I can't wait to go in there and spend the rest of our life together.
Oh. Oh, God!
Oh, seriously you want him?
Joey, why is your cable out?
Well, you know, I appreciate you giving it a shot.
She was not good. Not good.
Yeah, yeah, yeah! I want you... I need you... I must have you Janice Litman Goralnik Neihosenstein.
Oh, tons, I'm quite the woodsman.
She gets crazy! This scar is from Pictionary!
Yes, of course.
Oh that's great, my friend Joey's in the movie business.
Wow, you look...
You know you don't want me to help. You can't have it both ways!
Oh, nononowaitwaitwaitnono! Uh... we may not know anything about radiators per se, but we do have a certain amount of expertise in the heating and cooling... mileu.
Oh, I have to get married in James Bond's tux!
Im just trying to find the right moment, you know?
Tuna or egg salad? Decide!
So uh, man, are you gonna go to the play with me tonight?
Ohhh. Don't go.
Hey, come on, give me a break, I'm out on a limb here.
All right.
Hey Phoebs, can I have the milk after you?
Hey, look at this. "My Big Book of Grievances."
Oh, she's at home, putting up decorations for Rachel's birthday party tonight.
Yes!!
Ye-e-es!!
Okay.
Yeah, she was at Rockefeller Center skating with her husband, she looked so happy. I almost feel bad for whipping that kid's pretzel at them.
Already?!
Hey, why don't you wear those earrings I gave you?
Maybe, isn't she the woman who lives below you and has sex really loud?
Why?
Phoebe is going to say "yes"? That's, that's great!
What?
Oh-ho-ho, yeah!
Yeah I know, guess who beeped him?
Uh, could you leave me one?
That was like 5 years ago.
Oh, yeah?
Look, this isn't funny! You get back here right now!
I'm telling ya, Joanna's got it all wrong. Okay? All I said was, 'This was fun. Let's do it again sometime. I'll give you a call.'
"The Firm"?
Here we go.
I'm in college and I'm in a band.
To Ross!
Oh, I'm Ross. I'm Ross. I'm too good for the Hut; I'm too good for the Hut.
Yeeeeahhhh.
Wow, there's my fantasy come true. No, seriously.
Listen, they are really great. If you just got a chance...
Okay. Holy double-vented comfort Batman! What's this?
I told you I should not wear this color.
Wow! Just like in the pros.
I'm serious!
No problem roomie.
