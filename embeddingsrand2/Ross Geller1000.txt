Hey Mon, that was really nice of you to loan Rachel your car so she could go and get the cake.
Look, were down to just one point. Could we please, maybe just settle it after the wedding.
Oh! Man I don't think I've seen you since uh, Lance Davis' graduation party.
Than I want mine, too ! And if I win I'm gonna put it all into a very low-yield bond.
Hey.
What? What's wrong?
Most of you don't know me, I'm Rachel's boyfriend.
All right!
Oh my God!
I'm sorry. Ugh, Pheebs, you were, you were right about her. Y'know, she did try to use sex as a weapon! Yeah, I hurt my back a little.
Hi. How is she?
Uh Rach?
No, no, really, I've got to take the car back anyway, I'm spending all day tomorrow with Ben, It's fine, no guilt I promise.
And that's funny, why?
So I nodded off a little.
Not at all! I love this guy. Hey, I was so psyched to hear you're back with my sister!
Who wants to make some long distance calls?
Hey!
Just, y'know out.
Surely you can think of something good.
Hey, Joey.
What?
Is-is he ok?
As my lawfully wedded wife, in sickness and in health, until death parts us. Really, I do. Emily.
'Cause there's time to make up for that. We can do stuff together. You always wanted to go to that Colonial Williamsburg. How 'bout we do that?
Wow! Sorry. So uh, how are the new people?
You don't-you don't want to hear about my dream Officer...Pretty?
Yeah, see, we-we-we have to stop across the hall, because it's my sister. But, uh, uh y'know actually, growing up with a sister was nice because it really helped me understand women. Yeah, you-you should tell your friends that.
Okay! Okay. Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby.
Hey, we can rescedule for Saturday.
No.
You're bleeding.
Hey Pheebs, you know I'm i'm really glad you came to talk to me the other day and I hope I was a little helpful.
Sorry! Sorry! Oh, there! Hey Gary, who am I? Phone home!
No! No! No! The "Come here to me" is y'know for the ladies.
That was 14 hours ago.
Hey!
Y'know what would cheer you up?
Look, Mon, do you want us to uh, come back later?
Well I have to. Okay? If I don't, they'll take the class away from me. And...I already put it in my family newsletter.
Hey, hey!!
Monica, you're so lucky! He's like the most popular guy in school!!
You're drunk! Mom and dad are gonna be maaaaadd! Maybe I'm a little drunk.
Believe me, I've been dreaming about me and Rachel for ten years now. But now, I'm with Julie, so it's like me and Julie, me and Rachel, me and Julie, me and... ... Rachel. Rachel, Rachel.
What?! What does he want?! I wasn't doing anything!
That sounds great. Same for me.
I assume we're looking for an answer more sophisticated than 'to get you into bed'.
This is the coolest house ever!!
Do you have a minute? I'd like to talk to you about something I'm, I'm really uncomfortable talking about.
I'm trying.
Wait, well wh-wh-wh-where is she?
Actually she's a paleontology doctoral candidate, specializing in the centazoic era.
Okay, there are no stupid fights!! This isn't about the room, this is about what the room...represents! And unfortunately, this room could destroy you!!
Could you be less enthused?
Actually this looks like pretty good! Yeah! Boys will be boys?
What?
Why should Ben step aside? It was his audition in the first place! You-you just tagged along! You're like the uh, tag-a-long dad.
All right I've been feeling incredibly guilty about this, because I wanna be a good friend, and dammit I am a good friend. So just, just shut up and close your eyes .
What?
Thanks to a little something called "Helvetica Bold 24 point"!
Hey, do you guys think that if all those things happened, we'd still hang out?
FINE BY ME!!
Weird.. your psychic didn't mention anything about the scary pigeon...
Ohhh, hey! All right, listen, I-I have that TV thing in like two hours, and I need your help, okay? What do you think? This blue suit, or this brown one?
What? Whoa, whoa whoa whoa, what do you mean, back to Jordie? We never landed on Jordie. We just passed by it during the whole Jessy, Cody, Dylan fiasco.
Great. So let's get going?
Okay, okay. Enough, enough with the lunging. No! I'm sick of this. Okay. I've had it up to here with you two! Neither you can come to the party!
Well, it's not for sure but umm, we met this guy in the park who thought Ben was really cute--y'know, which he is--so umm anyhoo, he uh, he gave us his card and told us to bring him down for this commercial he's auditioning.
It was ok...
I'm here. How's my little boy? Want Daddy to change your diaper? So, did you have fun with Uncle Joey and Uncle Chandler today?
Me? No.
Maybe the pogo-stick likes it too?
Joey! Hey, I need to talk to Charlie. Is she there?
Oh. Uh, by the way, if it makes you feel any better. I happen to like 8-year-old boys.
I'll get it! I will get that!
Buy mommy.
Yeah, um, okay see, you were, you were on the list but my friend, Chandler brought up the very good point that you are international, so I bumped you for Wynona Rider, local.
'Kay, first of all, this attitude is not helping.
Oh I'll prove it! I'll prove it like a theorem!!
Over my dead body!
Oh, thanks Gunther. STUPID BRITISH SNACK FOOD!!!!!!!
Hey.
Yes! Ben learned a little trick.
Well l-look okay, it's probably just a mistake. Let me call Aunt Sheryl okay? Maybe you are invited and the invitation just got lost in the mail.
Ok, sweetheart, I'll call you later tonight. Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, hey, hey, you're not really gonna go through with this, are you?
I didn't order lemonade.
Yeah.
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What's with the tackling?
Oh my God.
Eh, you think? I mean, you went out with a guy who improved the accuracy of radiocarbon dating by a factor of 10!
Bye! Hey, I hope Emma isn't making it too hard on you.
Well, you should've seen the guy that she used to go out with. I mean, he's like Joe Rugby.
Look, if I can just do what Emily wants and get her to New York, I'm sure everything will be fine.
Because... the night you kissed Rachel was the night I kissed Rachel for the very first time.
I bet two dollars.
NO! I don't!!
I'm sorry about your date.
Yes, yes, you did.
Well, okay so, I don't have it all worked out quite yet. Just don't say anything to Rachel, please?
Well, yeah, of-of course I'm okay! What? I'm just being supportive. Supportive of you and this whole trip, and-and what-what is uh, what's this?
Yes, but I've lived here for 25 minutes.
I've got to talk to her. Ugh, I hate this part.
Well, I'll-I'll be there. I mean I have to wear a costume to all my classes that day anyway so...
Sure, one year is paper, but two months is lapdance!
I'm gonna, I'm gonna go to London and I'm going to fight for her.
I'm really gonna miss this apartment. Y'know, Ben-Ben took his first steps right over there.
Hey!
Don't blame the questions!
Hey, both you guys should be up there with me. I mean, you two are-are my... I mean, I'm lucky to have just one good...
Hey!
Hmm.
I've never walked down the aisle knowing it can't end in divorce.
Huh?
That's, that's Julie. Ju... Julie, Julie. Hi Julie.
Gentlemen, you're pick.
It's all right! Everything's gonna be all right.
Yes! We're getting married?!
Please take your time, it's an important decision. Not like, say, I know! deciding to marry someone, this is about a muffin.
I always knew I was havin a baby, I just never realised the baby was having me.
Um, see, but that's not the final draft.
Help!
Hey!
Halftime.
I'm hurt.
Yeah.
OK. Oh, oh, oh.
Well, uh, uh, I don't know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with the baby's name?
What, that wasn't the great news?
Well we gotta do something, ok? Nannies like her don't grow on trees.
Remember the Russian satellite, Sputnik? Well, I'm a potato or a...spud. And these are my antennae. So Sputnik, becomes... Spud-nik. Spudnik!
I don't know, I-I was all high.
Please.
Am I?!
Hey, is Chandler here? We talked about catching a movie.
No! Okay! Okay! Okay, look, can I, can I just-just talk to you for a second?
Oh my God! I love this apartment! Isn't it perfect?! I can't believe I never realized how great it is!
You're on!
That's nice. Get out Let's go, come on.
Oh. What's wrong with Ross?
Home is Home Star stew.
I would, but I bruise like a peach. Besides, y...you know, everything is gonna be fine. The baby's sleeping.
Yeah!!!
What do you mean?
Rings?
Ah, well, it means that I can sell cookies, but I'm not invited to sleep-overs.
You're right, you're right, it is...So you gonna invite us all to the big opening?
Oh, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah...
Yeah. Listen about that, the whole uh, who came on to who thing really doesn't matter. I mean, I think it would've happened either way. I mean if you hadn't initiated it I-I-I know I would've.
Should we send something?
Excuse me ladies. I'm sorry?
What was with the dishes?
Joey, you shouldn't lie on your resume.
Uh actually, we-we've narrowed it down to two names.
But is it technically a date if the other person doesn't show up?
Okay, okay, fine, you're right. Let's ah, let's take a break, let's cool off, okay, let's get some frozen yogart, or something..
Not her. Yeah, this is someone else I meet, and I-I can't decide between the two of them. Y'know the one from Poughkeepsie, even though she's a two hour train ride away, is really pretty, really smart, and-and a lot of fun. But this other girl, well, she lives right uptown. Y'know she's, well she's-she's just as pretty, I guess she's smart, she's not fun.
Okay, please-please Paul, just let me explain...
Hmph.
Yes you can!
I don't know. Phoebe, if one of us saw Mike with another woman would you want us to tell you?
What, that we had a baby? Come on let's give him a little credit, although, he did eat a piece of plastic fruit earlier.
What? No-no, a lurker.
Yeah. Yeah, it really was. But we...we gotta be careful. We...we can't let that happen again, y'know?
I think I have an old band uniform from high school.
C'mon, tell us.
Oh, Carol and I have a new system. If she punches in 911, it means she's having a baby, otherwise I just ignore it.
No, I-I-I'm serious, okay? I mean, think about it. You move in, you start fighting over stupid game rooms, next thing y'know you break up!
You're over me?
So Pheebs, are you gonna go back out there or what?
Crack isn't even an intravenous drug!
What, he gave you his home number? As in like, to, to his home?
That's funny...Do you think you'll ever work again?
Ugh. It's definitely getting worse.
The most amazing thing happened tonight. I thought my number was up. I had an actual near death experience!
Well we-we don't know for sure. But in my head it-it sounded something like this. Of course, this is just conjecture. Okay, that's uh, that's all for today. Uh Mr. Morse, can I see you for a moment?
200 dollars.
Yes, but I don't wanna die in your cab!
What?
You bought Shawn Cassidy!
Where'd you get fruit at four in the morning?
Uhh, not much. You guys want to see a movie tonight?
Oh, Emily that is, that is so great. It's gonna be so great! We're gonna be like-like-like two idiots in love!
Hey, is Rachel here?
I knew that was him!
Yeah, Charlie is gonna be joining my department.
Alright.
Anyone else? Huh? Bring 'em on!
Yeah, well it came to about $112, but what the hell, just call it an even 110?
Wha... what do you mean?
Nope! Something else.
Well uh, you see that, that little cluster of stars next to the big one? That is Ursa Major.
Yeah, well maybe Phoebe will switch with me.
No-no, thank you Miranda.
Will you make the mashed potatoes with the lumps?
Dude! How-how did you write this?
You were backpacking across Western Europe?
All right here. Watch me execute the three 'P's of championship play. Power. Precision. and penache.
Are you kidding? I have had some very dirty dreams about this...
Breathe.
There it is...
Yeah, I'm sure.
What do you mean, they're not moving in? They-they're still moving in right?
Excellent! Excellent, now-now do you want another question or a Wicked Wango card?
Huh?
See, there are still several areas that haven't been fully excavated.
Hey!
He could never get a woman like that in a million years.
Look, I didn't recognize it without that inflatable sheep.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What makes you think we're gonna break up?
This is unbelievable. I - I have never been so insulted in my life. Now, if you'll wrap up my free crab cakes, I'll be on my way.
Yeah!
I broke my thumb.
What, are we keeping Thanksgiving a secret this year?
No! No, I don't...don't want to.
Hey, do you have any gum?
You got me a cola drink?
Umm...
You can live with me.
What, I mean, a little, but no, what, go on.
Now you guys just got married, why is she so depressed?
What's up?
Well that's the first time we've said that.
Hey, y'know, y'know what would make me really happy?
Bye Ben.
What?
Hey.
So, what are you guys doing four weeks from today?
So, I just picked up a message from Emily, she and Susan are going to a poetry reading together!
Smooth man. Yeah, you got some chilie on your neck. Well, I just want to say, thanks everyone, this-this was great. And hey! See you guys Monday morning. Thanks Joey.
Okay, Monica: Right foot red.
Listen, I'm- I'm sorry I was so hard on you before, it's just I...
I'm gonna go.
Phoebe, I told her you already knew.
I tell you, I've never seen him this happy.
You still love me?
Okay.
: Joey, I'm a little shy.
No, you've heard my practice. Okay? Just-just give me a chance to perform for you and then decide whatever you want. And I'm not going to tell you what song I'm gonna play either. But uh, let's just say when it's over I'll bet there will be a we bit o' celebration.
Still-still, let me come... for me.
That's so Janine, you-you-you know what, do you know we're doing right now? You and I, we're interfacing.
If the place you are referring too is being in love, then she is in the same place as me because I am not in that place!
Ross? I... I grew up on your block! We had Thanksgiving together last year... I had a baby with your sister!
Hello! Can I get you anything?
Huh?
Oh man.
Nope.
Shut up! I Dream of Genie!
Wha-, oh, quit it.
Yeah-oh! Hey listen umm, Emily found this wedding dress in London...
Wow!
Rachel!
Yeah.
I'll have whatever Christine is having.
Cassie?
Joey, give me the bag.
Well, he had gravity boots.
No! Do you know what your odds are of winning the lottery? I...I mean you have a better chance of being struck by lightning 42 times.
Let's give it a shot.
Rachel, I can see you dialing! I don't understand why...
Oh, thank you. Hey, hey. Rachel!!!!
Yeah.
Yup! You could plunk me down in the middle of any woman's uterus, no compass, and I can find my way out of there like that!
Ooh, ooh. Because she's my ex-wife, and will probably want to bring her, ooh, ooh, lesbian life partner.
No, I'm genuinely sorry the Mark thing didn't work out. Look, Rach, I want only good things for you.
She, she was different.
Yep, we got it, we got it. Thank you so much.
No.
Really? You're not gonna return it?
Cigarettes?!!
Correct. Rachel claims this is her favorite movie...
Hey, anyone hear from Phoebe yet?
Of course it is. Yeah, come on in. Ooh-ooh, go by the window you can pretend to be surfing.
Actually, do you guys mind staying here for a while?
You know sometimes your words... they hurt.
Hi.
Okay, it's second down. Take all the second downs you need.
The blond woman is my ex-wife, and the woman touching her is her... close, personal friend.
Oh!
Laugh all you want but uh, she actually left me a message saying she'd like to go out again.
No you didn't. You said you would, but you never did!
Ok! So let's move on to the Renaissance?
No, I missed and hit the door. But, it opened really hard!
If you want to check your email, just ask!
Give me two.
Oh my God, you've got a crush on your sister's stalker.
Oh, I wish I knew, but the evaluations are all anonymous.
W-What was the one right before bananas?
You know what? That is a very good idea. I'm gonna go make a pitcher of Margaritas.
What? What? What?!! Well they should put that on the box!!!
Uh, y'know what? I'll tell you who it hurts! It hurts the kid who has all his clothes stolen in gym class so he has to go to the principal's office wearing nothing but a catcher's mitt!
Oh great! That means I'm stuck with, "So, we were watching you in there and you were sittin' right here! Whoa!"
Okay. All right. So let's see, let's play from the trash can, to the lightpost. Right. Two hand touch, we'll kick off.
Oh, you're right, I'm sorry.
No, hi, I'm, I'm an honorary Brown Bird
That is a great idea! And! I know Ugly Naked Guy because we've been watching him for like five years so that gives me back my edge! Oh, let's see now he had the trampoline.
Uh yes! Thank you.
Well maybe he'll get to go soon, like on a class trip or something.
Have you seen this? It's a new alumni website for college! It's cool! You can post messages for people, let everyone know what you're up to.
Hotel? Why isn't she staying with you guys?
Yeah!
Oh, and she's pregnant with my baby. I always forget that part. Helloo!
Uh, you weighted 200 pounds.
You know what I like most about him, though?
He's not?
Wow.
Hello?
Ok. Let's see. Oh, you should take her to the MET!
Nothing, nothing. Lee-lo, the laundry's done.
I didn't.
Uh, Rach? Does this bakery by any chance also bake erotic cakes? Say for bachelorette parties?
Shhhh!
Ok, cut! Great. That was... that was just... yeah!
Hey.
...everyone, this is Chandler!
Ewwww!!
Rachel!! Wow! You, uh, you look, wow!
Ready to go?
Well, when you're subletting an apartment from your wife's cousin and then you get a divorce, sometimes the cousin suddenly wants his apartment back.
Well, what is she goes down and-and sleeps with a bunch of guys?
Look, I'm not being any of those things, ok, I'm just being realistic.
Alright. The, uh, the neighbours must be vacuuming. Well, so long as we're here and, uh, not on the subject, I was thinking about, uh, how mad we got at each other before, and, um, I was thinking maybe it was partially because of how we, um...
Look, I don't have to answer your questions! Okay? I'm a big boy, I can do whatever I want!
Is there a hopping bonus?
Well sure. But I get married all the time so...
I know. He's like a new man. It's like a scene from Cocoon.
Hi! Hi! Hi. Has umm, anyone seen Chandler?
No, no, we want to wait, right?
Good evening officer.
Why? What was wrong with her?
God that is the most beautiful engagement ring ever!
Total wuss!
Not just restaurants, from our house.
Oh yeah, why not?
Well, hey. You're an actor, I say you just suck it up and do it. Or you just do it.
Y'know we should probably ask the doctor if she even knows how to deliver a baby that's half human and half pure evil!
Hey Chandler, what are you doing tonight?
I'm sorry I had to take such drastic measures to make my point, but I-look, I just want you guys to be safe. DANGER!!!!! Ahhh, huh? Unagi.
Shut-out!!
You ever figure out what that thing's for?
Hey! Uh, I thought, I thought you were at table six.
Yeah, well what about you? You weren't you know, so hot in college either. After everything he said, he'd go "ba dum bum chessh"
So, what are you gonna do?
Rach?
...so then President Steve told everyone that I was a cheapskate, and now the whole building hates me! A little kid spit on my knee! Y'know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna throw a party. That's right. For everyone in the building, and I'm gonna sit them down and explain to them, I am not a bad guy. I am not a cheap guy! I'm just a guy who-who stands up for what he believes in. A man with principles.
Hey.
Yeah!
What's going on?
Aww. Thank you, Aunt Phoebe.
Come on Rach, you can't even eat alone in a restaurant.
We can still catch that Ukrainian film.
Cassie?!
All right, that's it, I'm getting out of here.
Oh, who? Me?
well.. its just. its just in that case, then um. Emma would go to my parents.
May I come in?
Oh... ok, fine. But... ehm... I just have one question for you, ehm... When we exit should we walk, or run, or prance, or stroll...
We don't. But I thought it would be nice to get to know him. You know, maybe have a little dinner, drinks, conversation.
It's ok, because they have to get it out of their system, okay , but you're going to realize, this is the only place, you wanna be.
Oh Mon, I laughed so hard...
You got a job?
Know what-If somebody doesn't tell me what's going on right now...
What?
Yes, it's a deadly but beautiful sport.
No! Hey, you know what? I'm sorry. I would never force you... to hire someone you were this uncomfortable with...
I don't know, but I.. Look, even if she shoots me down, at least I won't spend the rest of my life wondering what would have happened. Where - where is my coat?!
I just can't see Chandler cheating!
Let's also get a hot plate!
Good. I'm just getting some coffee. So I'm alert for the wedding.
That guy, he burns me up.
Hey, what do you say we celebrate? Champagne?
I think I know too but I've been really wrong about this stuff in the past, so...
A '95 LeSabre?!
Toilet paper?
I... I do, I do not love Rachel. I'm gonna tell her right now about the whole thing so we can get this marriage annulled as fast as possible. Okay? Would I do that if I loved her?
It-it's great to meet you Paul.
He is my girlfriend's father, okay? It's-it's, it's weird!
Y'know what? He didn't want to talk to us about being angry, well maybe we don't talk to him at all!
Should I leave this open for you too?
Monica's right, swing dancing can be tricky. I'm gonna use the phone. I gotta cancel those five giant teddy bears I sent to Emily. My God, think of the massacre.
Oh my God, he just said your name, that's great! Good job Ben.
That's my sister.
Yeah.
Nooo!
Okay. So, um, Phoebe tells me you, ah, you play piano.
Hey Rach.
Shoot.
Uh, you're not gonna win.
It was...This disagreement over... My god. You...you look beautiful.
You know, I think that's a good idea-our babysitter just pounded in another Chardonnet. Bye, y'guys.
What woman?
Hey!
Haha! Got ya! Die, die, die!
Are you angry at me because I said your handwriting is childlike?
C'mon kid, let's go.
Okay.
Show them to me!
Then you should have said something before I met her.
What are you doing?
Oh, you and me?
That, that is funny. That is painfully funny. No, wait. Wait, yeah, that's just painful
What about the guy from the bar?
Now you are going to love these.
Hi.
That's it? You're not mad? I mean, it must've been terrible.
Yeah I'll press 1!
Look, they must be stopped!
Okay, that's it, I can't take it anymore.
Oh great, I live on the street.
Umm that's...that's a little misleading.
Okay. So well I'll umm, I'll have her home by midnight.
No, no, she's great and it's not like we haven't done anything. I mean, uh, uh, we, we do plenty of other stuff, lot's of other stuff, like uhh. . .
What's uh, what's going on? Do you not, do you not like Katie?
Oh hi! Ross Geller. And this is my friend Phoebe.
Oh, where are you guys going?
Yeah, it's really 6:00 tomorrow night our time.
Hey! Y'know that teacher who had a baby with her student?
Honey. Honey, have you seen my Harmon Kilerbrew bat? Bob doesn't believe I have one.
... and while there are certainly vast differences between these Mesozoic fossiles and the example of Homo erectus...
Hey! She didn't look 50!
Great!
Right, so that's a firm "no". I cannot believe this, I just keep striking out.
Great, actually. I'm thinking tonight, maybe the night. Yeah, I mean ah, the kids are gonna play together and then when they're asleep, I'm thinking Amanda and I break open a bottle of wine, and do a little "playing" ourselves.
Yeah, not as much as you used to love to play uncooked batter eater.
Oh.
So, are you gonna see him again?
What? How come that you don't have to go!
And why exactly would I do that?
I've been back and forth.
Spiderman?
No really, I-I am! I feel bad!
Really?! Hey, y'know what? Since you have such a great sense of what I need, uh ooh, here's-here's 60 bucks, why don't you take Phoebe down to that Colonial flea market of yours and get me some stuff.
You were at the coffeehouse!
What?
Oh my God. I mean...
And they knew about it?
I'm gonna get a new band-aid. Hey, how 'bout the time I cut the legs off your Malibu Ken?
True, but you're allowed to be unreasonable. You're having our baby.
Well, we're applying to a lot of them. Naturally our first choice would be one of the bigger state zoos, y'know, like, uh, San Diego... right? But that might just be a pipe dream, because, y'know, he's out of state. Uh, my vet, uh, knows someone at Miami, so that's a possibility.
Uhh, it was fun. We, we just had coffee.
Yeah, we kissed, but... nothing else... nothing else happened, okay.
Uh Joey, that's just the minumum amount due, that's your total due.
Huh, I don't know what to pick. Am I more thankful for my divorce or my eviction? Hmm.
Hey Mon!
Well, pretty incredible according to the message she left you on my machine. Hey, Chandler, why is this woman leaving a message for you on my machine?
Yes, you can, very much.
You're fast and irresponsible. That adds up to a bad driver.
That's funny. Umm.... It's not funny.
And she's supposed to buy this?!
And what did he ask you not to call him?
I don't know why you can't admit that you need me.
So umm, where are the other guys?
Ready sweety?
Hey! There are some men who will do whatever it takes to make their marriage work! Okay? There are some men who will stand by and-and watch as their wives engage in-in what only can be described as a twosome with some-some woman she barely knows from the gym!
What happened?
And it'll be cool to see it again! Yeah!
Yeah! Yes! Thank you! This is great. Thank you so much. And I swear, your kid is going to have the time of his life.
Come on, finish your enchilada.
Hey Pheebs, you gonna have the rest of that Pop-Tart?.. Pheebs?
Hi!
Okay. But not about this!
Ahh. Ooh, is this a ah, is this a bad time?
Thank you.
Okay is there...some kind of magic tunnel to this hospital?!
This is great. Rachel's gonna keep kissing guys until she finds the one she wants and I'm gonna die alone.
Thanks.
Come on!
Wow! How'd you get in there?
Hey, guys!
Oh my God!
Oh-ho, okay.
I mean, there's no point in spending time with someone if-if it's just fun. It's gotta be, it's gotta be going somewhere right? So where-where is it going? Ah! That's-that's the real question. And-and the answer is...is it's going somewhere...fun. Now I-I know what you're thinking, fun was fine for you like ten years ago y'know, but you're-you're not getting any younger. No I mean-No not you, not you, you-you are getting younger. I mean-you-you look like you're getting younger by the second-What's your secret?
It's Gandolf, and he's not coming.
No?
Bec-Did you not hear me?! She's an assistant professor in the Linguistics department, okay? They're wild! Why do you want to come anyway?
Hello! Can I get you anything? Huh? Lens cleaner? Your battery okay? Rachel!
Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, but then the coffee table won't be centered in the seating area.
I don't think you had an open mind about the name Ruth. I mean, come on, little Ruthie Geller, how-how cute is that?
Thank you.
Lady, he is people. He has a name, okay? He watches Jeopardy! He he touches himself when nobody's watching. Please, please have a heart!
That is what the thing is.
Your what?
I'm getting married today!! Ahh, whoo-hoo!!
Rachel, only one of us can do it, you have to choose. You and me together again.
You don't have to shout everything.
Unless... You anticipated that I would figure all this out and you know that it actually is a girl, and you really do want her to be named Ruth! Well, I'm not falling for that! Okay? Ruth is off the table!
Trying to date this woman.
Hi!
Hey, you'll never guess what just happened... Phoebe and I got mugged!
Yeah. Ya know, a boy and a girl. Hopefully the girl will come first so Ben here won't feel too competitive.
I'm the ring bearer.
Hey, you're not naked! So hey, Rach, when will we expect to see you tonight?
Oh, sorry we didn't know.
And tell them what? The naked guy we stare at all the time isn't moving.
I'm sorry... we... we can't.
What did you want to show us? Because all I can see is this bitchin' van!
You're looking!
No.
Hi, Julie. Hi, Julie. Julie, um, how are you?
Hello! Oh, sorry.
How do you count to five?
Whoa, hey! What are doing? Trying to get me drunk?
Item J437-A, color: winterberry. Hi umm, listen come here, come in. I'm so-so sorry about yesterday. I-I'm really sorry. It's just that I...
Uh, bigger than that.
Because I folded it up and put in my pants pocket. Do you...do you not look there?
Phoebe really likes the bike huh?
Oh, hey y'know, they-they really overcharge you for that stuff. But who cares?! Because it's all on me! That is, one big drink!
Forget it.
Hey!
Well I, I don't know. Why?
Try telling my wife that.
Why'd you say no?
I had just moved in. Thank you! Listen umm...
You know, I hate to lecture you guys, but it's kinda disgraceful, that a group of well-educated adults and Joey can't name all the states. Did you ever see a map, or one of those round, colorful things called "a globe?" Hmm?
Well, ??? think that's us?
Okay, well here we are. Now we're in a tough spot again, Rach. What do you want to do? How do you want to handle it? Huh? Do you wanna fight for us? Or, do you wanna bail? Look, I, I did a terrible, stupid, stupid thing. Okay? And I'm sorry, I wish I could take it back, but I can't. I just can't see us throwing away something we know is so damn good. Rachel, I love you so much.
Zoo dollars?
What? Ow!
I know! And-and the worst part was they took my backpack which had all the original artwork I had done for my own comic book: "Science Boy"
Well, Monica keeps changin' the channel.
Then be supportive like a guy.
Phoebe, you can't massage people in my apartment!
Thank you.
Yeah, i-it's for the museum. Someone found a bone, we want the bone, but they don't want us to have the bone, so I'm going over there to try to persuade them to give us the boit'sit's a whole big bone thing. Anyway, I'm gonna be gone for like, uh... like a week, so, uh, if you wanna reach me, y-you can't. So here's my itinerary . Um... here's a picture of me...
I know. That's why I did it. Come on, are they really that bad?
So much more.
C'mon, Chandler, I love your mom. I think she's a blast.
Ah I had a little thing with Joey, if you think this is bad you should see him.
I thought it was gonna be a closed casket.
Hey Rach. I, uh, got you a little present. . . I'll open it. It's a Slinky! Remember, huh. Walks down stairs, alone or in pairs, everyone knows it's. . . just a big spring. Alright, you still mad at me becuase of the whole. . .
Good, 'cause I love you.
Okay, umm. Did you ever see, um, Return Of The Jedi?
Paolo, I-I just want to tell you and I think I speak for everyone when I say...
I just wanted to tell you something before you heard it from someone else and I hope this isn't too weird, but uh, I had uh, a thing with Janice. What you're-you're not mad?
Wow! Uh...how are you?
What, it's not your fault.
Rach, have you never done this before?
What do you think you're gonna do, have sex with her right here on my couch?
Sure, I mean, do I wish me and Rachel living together would have worked out? Of course. You know, I'm disappointed, but it's not like it's a divorce.
Pheebs, you're talking about putting your body through an awful lot, I mean morning sickness, uhh, labour, and it's all for somebody else!
This was Carol's favorite beer. She always drank it out of the can, I should have known.
So, you're not going to Paris.
No! The guy is mean. I mean really mean. I think you should stay away from him.
No, no I don't want to do anything to you. All right? I just want to tell you that I'm not mad at you and...and that I certainly do not hate you. I just, I just came here to say that.
Look, I-I know it's not a proposal and I don't know where you are, but with everything that's been going on and with Emma and...I've been feeling.
Yes, you're right. Still somebody must have seen it... I mean, I went to that school for 4 years, I didn't have an impact on anyone?
Damnit!
What-what do you mean?
I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father.
He's right, even if it's to say something complementary.
Ooh, well. Ah, I kinda have got a lot on my plate right now, not that I wouldn't love a weekend in the country with a strange man.
Hey, I married a lesbian to make you look good!
FINE BY ME!!
What? No, that's illegal. I'm gonna have the labor department down her so fast they won't even...
Alright, I'm gonna go find them... I just need a... need a before I can... you know. Grandma... grandma... grandma... Okay, I see you later.
Women tell each other everything. Did you know that?
Listen, I-I need a favor. Umm, I was in the shower, and as I was cleansing myself, I ah, I-I, well I felt something.
Yeah.
That would be a good way to get rid of all the PCP we have lying around.
people so why you all dressed up.
Why?
Say something clever! Okay, doesn't have to be clever, it just has to be words. Say some words. Any words will do. Oh my God! This is the longest that anyone has not talked ever! There is nothing you can say to make this worse!! So just say something!! I-I, I uh haven't had sex in a very long time. Yeah, you really shouldn't have said anything.
Oh. Yeah. Uh Chandler let me win. No, Chandler's really strong. Oh my arm is so sore. Oh nurse!
Yeah. The bartender said that they split up into two search parties, the herbivores and the carnivores. You know, we as a group are not the coolest.
Alright, I want my monkey.
Oh.
Hey!
: OK, I am calling your seventeen. What do you got?
Easy. Easy. You have to go to the hospital. Okay?
What... what you working on?
You sure?
Too little, too late, Benji!
Chandler, I want you to run a post pattern to the left, okay. And sweetie..
Yeah. It would've been good if we had gotten in, but still real fun.
Oh oh, we think Emma is about to start talking so we're trying to be careful about what words we use in front of her.
Ah. Joey you're-you're having lunch with my mom?
Oh, no, I didn't mean, uh...
What are you doing here?!
Yes, of course they like you!
Yes, her molecular epidemiology paper is due tomorrow.
Yeah!
Chandler-
Department of Sanitation?
And confused. Rach, sweetie, I-I um...I didn't propose to you.
Well maybe, you know, maybe we should stay for one song.
You like it right?
Oh come on. It's cold, it's dark, he doesn't know the Village. And now I have a broken foot. I have no monkey, and a broken foot! Thank you very much.
Yeah?
Hey! Oh listen, I was just clearing some space for your stuff.
Okay, the other night I was leaving the museum just as 'Laser Floyd' was letting out of the planetarium, without even trying I sold 50 boxes! That's when it occurred to me, the key to my success, 'The Munchies.' So I ah, started hitting the new dorms around midnight. I am selling cookies by the case. They call me 'Cookie Dude!'
You wanna wander in the hall? Ooh, hey Ben, what if the Holiday Armadillo told you all about the festival of lights?
Hi! Listen uhh, this cat belongs to a little girl. There are flyers all over the place.
So I'm gonna take off then!
Hey!
Ah, Cheryl!
What's going on?
Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, that glacier's getting kinda close.' See?
Years and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees...
Correct. Chandler was how old when he first touched a girl's breast?
Oh God. Y'know, botanists are such geeks.
Sure.
I can't believe no one believes me!
I tired attacking two women, did not work.
In your mouth?!
Yes. I'm... I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
Well I told you it was Chandler who was smoking the pot but it was me. I'm sorry.
Wha? No no! Ah! All gone! So good! Maybe Chandler has some left.
What?
I think on some level, you-you sabotaged your own audition so that Ben would get the part.
I hate that guy.
Well, everyone's gotta kiss someone. You can't kiss Ross you got the history.
Well...
Phoebe that's not true.
I actually had a topic in mind! I'm, I'm kinda going through a dry spell, sex wise.
Wow, hello! You look great!
No.
Very bad.
Yes!
Ok, Mom never hit.
Oh, be-because of the leather pants.
Hi! Hi, I'm Ross, you don't know me, but I'm a big, big fan of yours. I mean, Blue Velvet, woo-oo hoo! Um, I was wondering if I could um, maybe buy you a cup of coffee? Or maybe reimburse you for that one?
Look, we've been together. Okay? And then apart, and then together, and then apart, and now we have a baby. It's just if-if we got together again and it didn't work out...I could never do that to Emma. I mean she-she thinking everything- Oh that's...now me. What do they put something in the water in this place? Since Rachel and I we're doing really, we're doing really well right now.
Well, I thought so too, but then she said she'd marry you.
Look. Look, I wasn't going to say anything to you, but... All right, I don't think you should be seeing Tommy anymore.
Okay.
No, no, no... why, because it might get weird for everyone else? Who cares about them. This is about us. Look, I-I've been in love with you since, like, the ninth grade.
We met at Phoebe's birthday party, I'm, I'm Ross Geller.
OK. I'm in my apartment...
Hey, what have you guys been up to?
It's my joke.
I love when you talk dirty to me.
Okay the sleeping thing. Very tricky business, but there is something you can do.
I have no idea!
At least I know she's not going out with me to get into R rated movies.
Joey!
I know, I know, it's, it's almost... What do you say we go take a walk, just us, not them?
C'mon, you'll make a day of it! You'll rent a boat, pack a lunch...
Oh see, before you uh, when you showed it to me you-you held it that way which uh, which was misleading. Well I'm... Hello.
What? Come on Rach, tell me what you're thinking?
Oh, great! Listen, oh I had to get you a whole new battery. I got you the best one I could, 'cause that's not where you want to skimp.
Huh.
They did?
Hey, wanna...wanna a little cheering up?
Phoebe, what happened?
Monica's pregnant!
I guess!
Well ah, you wanna just stay out there?
It'll be nice to get this off finally, won't it? Yes it will. Or we can leave it on for now, that's fine.
I don't care about your dad! I care about Mona! She was there and now she's totally freaked out!
Yeah, take your time.
Are you out of your mind?
Hi.
Okay Ben, Santa has to go. Say good-bye!
Hey! How long until Pete's fight?
Come on, it's fun!
Then what am I supposed to do?
Hmm-Hmm-Hmm. Okay. I, uh, am from Long Island. I-I came to the city for college. Um, I, um, have a 5 year old son and in my spare time I like to read spy novels. But, but, let's talk more about you. Hmm.
You know what? You know what? If, things were the other way around, there's nothing you could put on a list that would ever make me not want to be with you.
Yeah.
Phoebe, why is your bag moving?
What is the matter with you?!?
Yeah that's what she said.
Hey!
Not for tonight. Not for tonight! Wh-what, what, what, are you doing?
Mee mee, mee-mee mee.
I don't feel like having sex. Maybe we can watch a movie or something.
Hi, we're visitiing. It's Ben and his da-da. Da-da. Can you say da-da? Look, I'm gonna tell your momies you said it anyway so you might as well try.
Okay. Well, you be careful.
You haven't by any chance chosen a groomsman yet, have you?
Yeah.
Good for you.
Hi!
What?
Good weird?
Oh my God! Rach-Rach, are-are-are you sure?
So when she came in, I got distracted and totally forgot about the camera. It kept rolling and recorded everything.
Look, I'm sorry, but you guys are wrong. I just don't want to be divorced three times.
Oh, see from where I was sitting I uh. . .
FINE BY ME!!
Nope.
Hi.
No.
Look, forget it Phoebe. Okay? It's Rachel's tape and she can do whatever she wants with it. And she wants to destroy it. So, end of story.
Well that's different! Okay? Because he, he was actually in love with me!
Okay, okay. If that is what it takes to show you how much you mean to me, and how much I want you there. Then that's what I'll do.
Rachel, please...
Really?
Oh...
What are you, what are you doing?
I'm getting married today!! Whoo-hoo!!
Forget it, she's destroying it.
Okay, you don't have to stop, I'm invisible, I'm not here.
For what? For letting you throw me out of your office?
What?
Monica!
yes, yeah I said something stupid about her never having had a serious relationship, but you should know she is so much fun, a wonderful person please don't blow her off.
Food.
We're not gonna do that.
Why? What, what are you jealous?
No! No, no, no, no, okay, it wasn't the swing's fault. It was my fault and kind of that kids fault. Who is still laughing. Nice.
Calm down, I'm blow drying.
Hey.
No, you guys, I mean my keyboards are all the way up in-No, yeah, okay.
No. They swoop in and steal your jackpot.
No, no, I'm serious. Thank you.
Oh my God, she's great! I mean, we-we have so much in common and she's just cool, and funny...
Rach!
Whaddya got there?
We think Chandler might be having an affair.
I got it. So hi, I'm uh, I'm Ross and this is my friend Chandler.
Let me see! Show them!
I'm having a son. Um...
And then she said it was the perfect way to say goodbye.
Oh I'm, I'm making this too hard. Okay, what do you want me to do.
No no, this big pile of dishes in my mom's breakfront. Do you guys know who Carl is?
Oh, no, no.
Oh. And what do you call that?
You don't think it's a little crazy that you get all my points just 'cause you...
Oh, see I-I don't know if we're gonna be hungry at three.
Great! I'm across the street having sex with her right now. Your story sucks!
Can we, can we just forget this ever happened?
Look, don't worry about me. Okay? I'll just stay real energetic and stay away from the ball. I'll uh, I'll be that guy right out of the circle.
Thanks, Gunther. Hey! Umm, can I get a napkin too?
Uh, Rachel, I've been thinking. I don't think us getting together tonight is such a good idea. I'm calling it off.
Of course, what happened?
Is Rachel here? I gotta talk to her.
Oh, umm, I'm just getting rid of a couple of things.
Too far, Amy. Too far.
Yeah.
Oh my God, wh-what happened?
Oh-oh, Rach! I was just messin' around! Like you did last night when I had to pee?
Are you kidding?!
No.
I gotta go find her.
Oh, that'd be great! Okay, but if you do, make sure it seems like you're there to see him, okay, and you're not like doing it as a favour to me.
I love this.
Is that-are you saying yes? Is that yes?
Yeah? Any names come to mind?
All right. Uhh, international.
She wants me to move to London.
Yeah, and-and thank you for Emily.
Ok.
Gimme this.
I don't see why not.
Are you all right?
No! No! Of course it didn't mean anything! I mean, uh well, I can understand why Emily would think it meant something, y'know, because-because it was you...
Yeah, that's how I know. I'm Ross by the way.
Okay, I have a problem I have to go into work for a few hours, some kids messed up the Homo Sapien display.
Hey guys!
Yeah-ha!
I'm not proving anything. Okay, I'm done listening to you. If I hadn't let you talk me into going to the airport in the first place, I never would've put my fist through the wall!
C'mon! Joey! What is it?
Hi!
Amy, I ju... I just... I just wanna...
Oh Great! After I finish my wine I'm going to blow my... eh. average-sized brains out.
Bumpy?
See, I would never snap at you like that.
Yeah, see, I don't think it's gonna that difficult considering this one won't be taking place in the basement of a Pizza Hut.
Do you know the word crapweasel?
But work comes first! Oh hey, but that's sad about you though, what happened? Burn out? Burn all out, did ya?
Hi.
Oh, I hope they're not ruined.
Of course I am! Okay, let's go godfather.
So we...we both wanted to.
No!
Yeah.
An egg?
No.
She... she only dates geniuses and Nobel Prize winners. Oh my God, at the chinese restaurant earlier today, I put chopsticks in my mouth and pretented to be a woolly mammoth.
You should go.
What happened you guys?
Oh yeah, let me just finish this.
Oh yeah! Batch 17 was good. I did not like batch 16. I'm okay.
Okay, it was just me and her at the back of the train, and I sat near the door, so she'd have to pass by me if she wanted to switch cars. She was totally at my mercy.
Look let's not make a big deal out of this! It was a one time thing. It doesn't even matter!
She hates Pottery Barn?!!
Yeah.
Yeah, uh... and then I figured after you win, we could all go out to the balcony and see a night rainbow with gremlins dancing on top of it!
Yeah, I uh, totally forgot about that. You mind if I take a rain check? I'm waiting for a call from Emily.
Come on up. I'm gonna get the rest of his stuff together.
Rach?
What's with her?
Wow! I'm honored! And y'know what I'm gonna do as my first act as your best friend?
Underwear, a toothbrush, and Van Halen CD. I can use all these things!!
You know, I might have expected this of you Phoebe, but Ryan, you're a military man.
Hey! Guess what I got for your wedding!
Phoebe?
I'm sorry. Dr. Green, Mona. Mona, Dr. Green.
No... I already e-mailed her.
When you put a 'D' at the end of 'Fine' you're not fine.
I don't know. I mean I have plenty of opportunity. Just just now there were some women at the coffee house smiled at me.And then the other day on the subway a woman "accidentally" sat on my hand.
Is there blood coming out of my ears?
Okay.
Monica? Monica, Monica, Monica, Monica..?
Okay, last night after you guys broke up... so sorry to hear about that, by the way... Well, Charlie and I were talking, and..., well...
That's a good point.
That's correct. Ladies?
Really?!
And that is why we cannot see each other anymore.
This is crazy! I mean, yes-yes Rachel is my good friend and I-I have loved her in the past, but now, she is just my wife! Phoebe, will you-will you help me out here?
The point is I... I don't need this right now, OK. It, it's too late, I'm with somebody else, I'm happy. This ship has sailed.
Well then a small one!! Listen, let's, we kinda have to get going!
High collar and baggy pants say I'm a pro.
Hey!
Oh, it looks like mom and dad's house. Oh, it even has a tree with a broken limb out front and the uh, the window in the attic is...Oh my God!!
Yeah! I-I teach it in my class.
Okay.
Uh no, no just-just that he is a great guy.
All right, all right, it's just that you left a red sock in with all your whites, and now, everything's kinda pink.
So, um- so how's this, uh, how's this gonna work? Y'know, with us? Y'know, when, like, important decisions have to be made?
Oh, ah, you don't need that.
I had no idea. And that-that pillowcase thing, I thought you guys were just doing the flying nun.
But-but Cailin, he definitely will scream.
No, NO! Look, I need to talk to Joey. I mean, you guys just broke up. Before anything more happens between us, I need to know he's okay with it.
Wait a minute! How-how the hell did you beat us here?
What?
Yes, yes of course, what-what would this be regarding?
I'm sorry Chandler, but this, this is really important to me.
What happened?
Yeah.
Is the old woman on the bicycle still alive?
You understand I don't actually like 8-year-old boys.
I uh, I don't know, I guess I'm just gonna see, see what happens.
Rach, we gotta go.
Okay, um... I don't want her watching our baby.
Okay, bye.
You know what I don't care. The only person I cared about getting dressed, is the one person that says she's not even gonna go. Look Rach, I'm sorry. Okay. Look, I-I wa, I was a jerk. I'm sorry I yelled. I want you there, I need you there. Look, what, what can I do that can show you how much, how much I want you to be there.
Okay.
Oh, thanks!
Damn it. It's never off the table.
So listen ah, I picked Monica for secret Santa, but I'm already getting her something for Chanukah, I was wondering if you wanna switch.
Come on!
Wow! It actually is in the handbook. I can't date you or have a hot plate in my office. I can't believe we have to stop seeing each other.
I think he's been relaxing enough, thanks to you and Fireball.
Guess what?
That's a good question, dad. That's a good question...
Cool.
Namaste.
Wow! This is so amazing. I uh, I really thought I'd have to talk you into this more.
If you have to call me name, I prefer "Ross the Divorcer". It's just cooler. Look, I know my marriage isn't exactly work out. But I love to be that committed to another person. And Carol had some good times before she became a lesbian... and once afterward. I'm sorry.
Aqui est.
What are you doing?
Oh! So-so seriously, what time?
Look, you can't do this Mon. All right, if you do this, I'm, I'm gonna, I'm, I'm gonna.....
I know, I wasn't finished. But don't worry! We're gonna go down the fire escape!!
I'm supposed to attach a brackety thing to the side things, using a bunch of these little worm guys. I have no brackety thing, I see no whim guys whatsoever and- I cannot feel my legs.
I uh... I don't know. I mean I...I honestly didn't watch it.
And you told Phoebe you were engaged.
Wha-, you have a phone in here?
Now, if you need to stay late, I want to be supportive of that.
Who's drink can I freshen?
Uh, that, that, that would be a judgment call.
Stop it!
No, no, with him. I'm on this field, and they, they hike me the baby... and I, I know I've gotta do something 'cause the Tampa Bay defence is comin' right at me.
Well, start looking.
Hey.
No thanks. I'm 29.
All right. 'Candy and Cookie?'
Aww that is so cool.
Okay, Monica. Mon, uh what-what you just saw...
You're kidding.
What?
Here goes...
Yes, very nice Rachel.
What's up?
Where the hell have you been?
My God!
Can I have everyone's attention please? I'm uh; I'm Ross Geller.
Yeah, most of it it's a place packed with confused angry baseball fans!
Of Ross and Rachel.
Fine. I just need to know that you're not gonna tell your sister.
Ma, you're asking me to marry you?
Yeah. You see my-my sister makes these amazing turkey sandwiches. Her secret is, she puts a, an extra slice of gravy soaked bread in the middle; I call it the Moist Maker. Anyway, I-I put my sandwich in the fridge over here...
So, did he get on one knee, did he have a speech prepared, or did he cry? Yeah, big surprise, I like proposals!
Ah, which, which one?
Well, her thought is, and I agree, fresh new furniture, why not a fresh new apartment? Her cousin has this great place to sublet, it's got a view of the river on one side and Columbia on the other.
Well, Ben would be there.
Not so much.
Sure.
Hey Mike sorry to just drop by like this, can I come in?
Oh Joey, Joey! But still, I mean, it seems like you guys are having a great time together.
No, not a problem.
Chandler?
Ah, yeah, yeah. Umm, we started talking after she y'know, did her thing. And it turns out she's got a boy about Ben's age, so we're taking them to a gym-boree class. Why, is that okay?
Look, G. I. Joe's in, Barbi's out. And if you guys can't deal with it, that's your 'too bad.'
Perfect. Perfect. So now everybody's getting kissed but me.
Ah! Oh.
Hi.
All right, here's the ring.
She looks so small.
I just-I-I can't believe she's-she's dating?!
Sure. Sure. Look I don't, I don't know if your plans are finalized yet, but umm, hey I-I know another great way to blow off steam.
It's the only possibility, Phoebe.
What?
So I guess you bought that book after we broke up huh?
I play squash...! Anyway, uhm... I uhm... I always get the feeling he thought I was too sensitive.
Get out!
God no!
Momentary lapse. Don't-don't you have any self-control?
Look, this is just a little too familiar, okay? For like, for Like six months before Carol and I spilt up, all I heard was "My friend Susan is so smart. My friend Susan is so funny. My friend Susan is so great."
Are you sure?
Hey Pheebs, what-what was the deal with you and Chandler blowing us off before?
Oh, I just thought we could go out to dinner, and then maybe bring her back to my place and I'd introduce her to my monkey.
Okay, you are totally making this up.
Oh hey, show them the picture of your uterus.
Hi, I was wondering if it is possible to increase security in the Paleontology section? See I-I wrote a book up there and instead of reading it people are-are-are well, rolling around in front of it.
Hi! Hi, I'm uh Ross. I'm here to ruin this magical day for you.
Uh-hmm-Wait! It gets better. Um, yeah I was in Barcelona.
Oh yeah, about telling Mom and Dad, I was thinking about maybe writing a letter.
Chandler's gone again!
There we go. All better.
No, God! Hey, Rach, you've been an amazing daughter, ok? Right now you just need to get some rest.
Wow! Really?!
You-you-you-you threw my sandwich away!
Whoa, whoa, but then the back of the couch won't line up with he back of the carpet.
When Monica was a little girl, I remember that--Ooh!! Ow! Very good!
It tastes like feet!
Oh, you're...
Well, why don't you just start with something simple. Like umm, Monica from the moment I met you, I knew I loved you.
Uhh, hey look, I don't really enjoy being with other men that way. But, um, zoo dollars?
What a great idea! That will get Rachel to forgive me!
Marcel, Marcel, give Rossie the remote. Marcel. Marcel, you give Rossie the remote right now... Marce... you give Rossie the remote...
Oh, no!
Well... I like how you look, what are you?
It's-it's hot...
How come it's not mixing with the water?
What?
Oh my God! Our daughter's a genius! Rach, this means...
Uh Mr. Morse, can I speak to you for a moment?
Oh great!
You got it! . All right, she's right, we gotta get serious. Let's put styrofoam peanuts down his pants and kick him!
Uhh, okay, it's uh, Emily and I, we decided to uh, to get married.
No, it's okay. Some-some kid asked me to pick it up for him, but I don't...
This year was supposed to be great! But, it's only the second day and I'm a loser with stupid leather pants that don't even fit!
What?!
A wandering?
Dude, what are you doing?
That's great! Are you happy now? Look what you did with your funny, funny form!
Well actually, I'm picking Ben up tomorrow, maybe he'll be there.
What? What?!
Dad, she won't want to go with me.
Hi, Pheebs!
Won't you dance around with me.
Oh, of course...
Look, I'm sorry.
'Pwease, Aunt Monica, pwease?' Oh, unclench. You're not even gonna be there.
I love you too! I'm, I'm gonna call you right now from the phone booth! You can't hear me.
Ohh, Geller's got one hooked! Ohh! Looks like a big one! Yeah, ohh! Ohh! It's the classic struggle between man and- Someone knocked over a lamp.
Yeah, no one talks like that!
Hey!
Oh God, this is so nerve wracking! How-how do you do this?
Right, but, it is just me and the baby, so I'm thinkin' they can take us. And so I uh, hah-hah, I just heave it down field.
Okay, now just remember everything I taught you and you'll be fine. Okay? Here we go. Ready...Set...
That is an old, Chinese woman!
Oh, I see, so everybody wins.
No, no, don't. Why don't we?
Same difference.
Someone at work ate my sandwich!
Why?! Why on the lips?!
Oh, please. Sweetie it's hopeless, okay, I'm just gonna go.
Yes, I do.
Yeah, uh, uh, ok, there's this great rare bookstore on Madison Avenue. You know what? She loves architecture, you know what you should do? You should take a walk down fifth to the Saint Patrick's Cathedral and there there's this great little pastry shop that she'd love.
I made fun of his accent.
Huh? Oh-oh, it was fine. Uh, it was just a misunderstanding. She didn't want me to go with her. She just wanted to let me know that she's going to Florida for spring vacation.
Okay, okay, okay. I'll get the bagels.
Look Rachel, I wanted to tell you, I thought I should, I-I did, and then Chandler and Joey convinced me not to.
Stay away!
Damnit! I have this date tomorrow night and I have to look cool!
Why do they keep doing that?
Thanks. OK.
Noo! No, not cuddlily, not me, just her. I'm like you, I need the room. Okay, come here. Okay, you're in bed...
Okay, okay, I'll tell 'em it wasn't Chandler who got high. Now who should I say it was?
Well, I guess I'm gonna call the beer company and try to find out where he is.
Yeah, it's hard okay, I only have two spots left.
Okay. Now-now-now should I climb down your front so we're face to face or-or should I climb down your back so we're-we're butt to face.
Exactly!!
You know, I think thats a great idea. It'll be like the pilgrims bringing the Indians syphilis.
Alright, I've gotta go. C'mon, Marcel! C'mon! We're gonna go take a bath. Yes we are, aren't we? Yes, we are.
Well, I guess we could tape Entertainment Tonight.
Hey uh, I brought you some lunch.
I, I just never think of money as an issue.
Check again please!
No! No we don't!
Right! Right! I just-I want you to know that I'm going to be there through this whole thing, okay? Okay? The doctor's appointments, the uh, the Lamaze classes, uh baby-proofing the apartment-Although we could probably worry about that 'til after we get married.
Ewwww!!
Okay, look, I-I know what you guys are going to say...
I can't believe you told her I was going to propose!
Hey, I'm not going to rush into anything!
Look, face it, my father is not going to pay for the build-in barbecue and believe me you can kiss you gazebo goodbye. Now I might be able to get you the new lawn.
Hi Amy!
Married couples send out cards, families send out cards, people who have been dating for a couple of months do not send out cards! What-what is she crazy?!
Well I am that. And that whole rage thing is definitely behind me.
Pretty please? Not very uh, 007.
Okay look, there's nothing to worry about. We have plenty of time. There's a great baby furniture store on west 10th. Tomorrow, we will go there and we will get you everything that you need. Okay?
Hey roomies!
Sorry I ah, I scared you in there.
...nauseous, I'm physically nauseous. What am I supposed to do, huh? Call immigration? I could call immigration!
Where the hell are Joey and Molly? I asked you to watch them.
No. No. No, I'm-I'm glad you did. Look, if nothing else, it's-it's always great when someone tells you they love you.
This one?
Whoa-whoa-whoa, hey! Now remember what we talked about, you gotta be strong.
