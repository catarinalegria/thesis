Are you okay Mon?
Yeah.
Ohh, it's Joshua invited me to this fancy club opening tonight. But, I already told Mr. Waltham that I would take his niece to this dumb old opera. So... What are you gonna do?
Oh, God.
Phoebe, you were right. I should've never gone to London, and from now on you make all of my decisions for me.
Right.
Hi! Hi Ben!
Well, from me. And I know it's not your big money song, but it's my favorite.
Hi! Uhh, do you guys have plans for the weekend? Because I have my sister on hold, and she said that we could use her cabin for the weekend and go skiing. Huh? I'm asking you first, right?!. I mean I'm playing by the rules.
Sit!
Oh, that is so sick.
Y'know what, you are mean boys, who are just being mean!
Oh my god.
Hey! Hi!
Well, Joey probably thinks I'll just embarrass him. Y'know, he thinks I'm some kind of a soap opera nut-Which I'm not! I'm not. Although I do know that your uh, your favorite ice cream flavor is butter pecan. And uh, and that your-your dog's name is Wally. Well look at that, I'm just stroking your arm.
Monica, y'know what? The only reason I did that was because your party was so boring!
Hey!
Okay, here we go.
You don't know?!
Hi! Will, right?
She's ok, I just don't get a really good vibe from her!
Since when?
Sorry, I thought you were talking to me.
Oh well...
What? C'mon you guys, I don't care, I have a date tonight.
In the future, when a girl asks for some ill-advised sympathy sex... just do it.
I'm Rachel Green.
Y-Yeah! What-what is your wife's name?
She's mine!
Wow, y'know if Joey and Chandler walked in right now, we could make a fortune!
From you. I exchanged the blouse you got me.
You are not. You have never been able to break up with her.
Yeah Pheebs, honey, she just got engaged a couple of hours ago. I doubt she's even had time to...
No! Joey, oh you're so sweet. You're so-so sweet, honey. But I'm not, I'm not looking for a husband.
Shhh! I want to hear the rest!
Yeah, I know... ..I'm I'm just not that bright either.
What?
Well, I think you're forgetting the kinkiest former resident of that room.
Ross, Chandler wrote something about me on his computer and he won't let me see.
How often do you read it?
I know. Yeah, see, there's so much to do and I have so little time to do it in.
Well, I have been spending a lot of time in the lab.
Well, if it makes you feel any better, I wish my date hadn't shown up.
Oh, little 'X's! Great! That makes up for everything!
Yeah, right. Look at you, you're practically giddy.
What about all the women you want to bring home?
Allison's birthday party.
Huh, that's funny. You look like you're gonna be the...
Well, we're not here to meet guys. You have a boyfriend, I have a b. . . baby and a Ross.
Oh, well, I guess I had that one coming. I'm just gonna throw it out, it's probably just a bunch of shampoo and...
Hi! How are you?
Okay, good. Now that since you know, when you come over would you mind actually using it?
Hi!
No! You gotta get me out of here Phoebe! These bargain shoppers are crazy!
Absolutely! Absolutely!
Oh-oh-oh, he's a transponce-transpondster!
Ah.
Ooh, goooosh, ooh, these are cookies smashed in the sports section.
Okay, okay, okay, I got one! Anyway- The valentine Tommy Rollerson left in your locker was really from me.
Shake that nasty butt...
Oh!
Really Joey?
I don't know! Maybe they have tools.
Well, who wouldn't?!
You're right, I don't have to apologize. Sorry. Damnit!
Hey, Mon, if you were hoping to sleep with Joshua the first time tonight, which one of these would you want to be wearing.
See, there's always one guy. "If I had a wish, I'd wish for three more wishes."
What?!
Well, look, it's hardly snowing anymore. I mean you couldn't ask for a more romantic setting. This could be the simple wedding you've always wanted!
Oh!
Well actually thanks, but I think I'm just gonna hang out here tonight. It's been kinda a long day.
No, you! Phoebe you freaked me out. You kept saying how huge this all is!
No. No. Every thing's--they're fine. Great pizza. But it's uh, actually umm my friend Ross. He uh, just gets really nervous when he's flirting.
Oh, sorry.
I hope you're going somewhere with this.
Phoebe!! Phoebe!! It's okay!! It's okay!!
Yeah that would really be great.
Well umm, maybe we could uhh... Ah-ha! Too slow!!
No Ross!! Don't! You can't just kiss me and think you're gonna make it all go away, okay? It doesn't work that way. It doesn't just make it better. Okay?
Thank you. Oh Joey and look at this crib! It's so cute!
OH! Alright, you know what? That's it! I want my share of the tickets !
All right, y'know what, come on, do we really have to watch this while we eat?
Oh.
Hey! So, did you quit?
Rachel...
No, I'm still going.
Hello, excuse me.
I knew that! I knew that! I was just messin' with you too!
Oh wait, I have the ten of spades! Here!
Okay, I'll see you after the thing.
Or ya know, he's rubber and you're glue.
Excuse me, I wanted you to help, but you couldn't move your arms because you were wearing three life jackets.
And I hope Barry doesn't kill you and eat you in Aruba.
I don't know, I mean I would give anything to work for a designer, y'know, or a buyer.... Oh, I just don't want to be 30 and still work here.
Do you even know what a vicar is?
Yes I can!
Obviously you know how to haggle, so I'm not gonna try and take you on. Okay? So $800 and I don't call the cops because you're robbing me blind! Blind! Just take cat, leave the money, and run away! Run away! Damnit! Cat, can't you at least smile or something?! Okay, did anybody just hear that? Anybody?
Well, you might want to tell him it sounds like his wife is gay.
Oh, okay. Will you take my place?
Yeah! That's Phoebe. That's Phoebe. You know, she just wants them all! It's like she's a nympho!
Ok... I got a spider. There were two, I picked the bigger one.
God, Ross, look, what you and I have is special, all Paolo and I ever had was...
Hey! Hey-hey-hey!!
Honey, it's so sweet that you want me to stay, but I-I can't do that to you. I mean it would disrupt your entire life.
No I know, because to be a grandmother you have to be married and have children and I don't have any of those things. That's why it's so funny.
Hey.
Where ya going?
Well, I'm sorry, I thought you needed them!
It was an amazing night.
Ok, Well, what about these are white cotton panties. Would they go with whites or delicates?
oooh! Oh oh!
Joey, we're not keeping this!
Joey, why don't you just tell her what happened? It's not your fault.
I need to talk to you!
Me? I'm great! I'm fine! I'm sooo good!! But, you know who's not great?! Men! You're a man right Ross?!
Oh my God....What's he gonna do now? I can't watch! Oh. Seriously, how can you watch this? Aren't you scared?
Wha!? What!? Come on! I found the hardware store all by myself!
Okay. Oh man, I swear if they sold these at Pottery Barn...
Yeah.
Good bye!
Well, I have to say that earns tutu pieces of candy.
Oh yeah, I'd actually love a blueberry muffin and a chamomile tea.
Oh-ho!
Ross, thank you. Hey, do you guys wanna go see a movie?
Gunther, I quit.
Hi, thanks for coming.
I got the job!
I've just been thinking about how my baby and I are gonna be all alone.
Well relax, he'll be here.
What!?
Well, here's another question for ya. Uhh, do you know what that silver knob on the toilet does?
Yeah but Phoebe...
So it seemed that my prom date had stood me up, so Ross selflessly, offered to take me.
Okay. Yeah, that would be nice actually, to have the apartment to myself for a night.
No, no Phoebe no, I was...no. You know what, I was, I was actually just checking to, see, if I could run. And I can!
Just when you thought that dude couldn't get any wierder.
Why?
Pheebs, I... there isn't gonna be any flying about! We actually thought we were a little too mature for stuff like that.
Ah, a little preview!
No. No.
Oh, yeah.
I don't want you to date her!
Oh, slides. So really nothing happened.
Well, if it makes you feel any better, I made a fool out of myself.
Maybe. But just a little one. Phoebe got the whole world.
Cat! What'm I saying? Cat!
Is Ross here?
Oh my God!! Great!
Well, yeah, right, y'know what? Yeah, you're right, I mean, we no, we have our fun. Yeah! But if ......I mean, I mean like craaaazy! Y'know? Okay, all right. This is gonna, this is gonna sound y'know, a little umm, hasty, but uh, just go with it. Umm. Ugh. What if we got married?
Oh thank you so much. Oh oh wait! You forgot your erm...Your game.
We are so gonna find them this year.
Y'know, it was, uh.. it was actually really great. He took me to lunch at the Russian Tea Room, and I had that chicken, where y'know you poke it and all the butter squirts out...
Sandy made Madeleines.
Okay!
That's 'cause you have it.
Oh-A.
Hello? Mindy! Hi! Hey, how are you? Yes, yes, I've heard, congratulations, that is so great. Really? Oh. Okay. Okay, well I'm working tomorrow, but if you want you can, you can, you can come by and... Okay... Great... Great... All right, so I'll, so I'll see you tomorrow! Okay.. Okay... Bye. Oh God. Oh God. Oh God.
That is the most ridiculous.
Oh yeah, I got a cat.
Oh, I am, my side still hurts from when you crashed into me yesterday.
Hi Daddy.
I just finished getting Phoebe all dressed to meet Mike's parents. She's so nervous, it's so sweet!
What?
Uh-huh.
What's that song? It has been in my head all day long.
I know you did. I'm just gonna deal with it, I'm just gonna deal with it. I gotta get out of here.
Me too!
Well, then so you just invite me...!
Okay, you just go on and make your little jokey-jokes, but if you do not know what you are doing out at sea you will die at sea. Am I getting through to you sailor?!
Really!?
Oh Monica that was the best Thanksgiving dinner ever! I think you killed us.
Hi.
You ah, you didn't say 'Yes' to that did you?
We don't want it-it to be too much, we want it to be subtle.
Oh, no, no, no. Presents first. Food later.
Ohh, thank you.
I was just going to say that I left my keys.
Oh!
Yes, I'll meet 'em.
Honey, I was wondering....
Nah, uh, uh, uh, uh.
Well y'know if you, if you started smoking again you could've at least told me! Come on, give me one of those! What are we talking about?
What, what, what?
Hey!
Right.
Oh my god.
Well, can I talk to you for a sec?
Oh really? So you're saying they just slid out of your bottom drawer, crawled across the floor, then jumped on to my desk?!
OK, I'm doin' it for ya.
I mean, y'know I'm just gonna have to accept it ...
Well, you should have.
I mean, do you think there are people who go through life never having that kind of...
Phoebe, Shania Twain is still alive!
Y'know, I don't-I don't know. Let me, let me check.
Really?!
Oh, y'know, it's just like hats, and a shirt, and CD's, just sort of stuff that you've left here.
What? Why?
You're hurt!
What?! What?!
Joey!
