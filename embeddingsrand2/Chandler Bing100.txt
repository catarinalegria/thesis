YOU NEVER DID IT!
Whoa-whoa-whoa! You broke Joey's chair?
I can't smell your sandwich?
With the balled-up socks? I figured you taught him that.
No! Shhh!
Relax! We just get her some antacids.
You didn't like that?
Mrs. Tedlock. You're looking lovely today. And may I say, that is a very flattering sleeve length on you.
So I laugh at my boss's jokes, what's the big deal?
I think it's the dying cat parade.
What does it look like? I'm going home.
All right! Go left! Go left! Go right!! Go right!!
I don't sound like that.
BEND OVER?!!!
Okay!
Y'know, maybe this isn't such a big deal. Y'know, I mean, the way that I see it is you get a great job and you get to have sex. Y'know, I mean, throw in a tree and a fat guy and you've got Christmas.
Eldad, sit down. Move over! Move over now!
Uh Kathy, with K or a C?
Yeah? I hope you're not thinking about cleaning the living room.
Shh! Nice to see you again.
No! No! Not, Paris.
Yeah, me either.
All right!
Who are you going out with?
Are you all right?
See? Intuitive!
Yes, hitting her with a frying pan's a good idea. We might wanna have a backup plan, though, just in case she isn't a cartoon.
Right here!
Uhm, thank you, but we're really trying not to get our hopes up.
Yes. Yes, thanks for letting me use your phone... and for saving my life.
Ohh, so?
Because uh...we-we...we split up. Monica and I split up. Hold me.
I noticed you were enjoying that Ravioli with a beautiful set of teeth. Did you have braces as a child?
well, well, well it must be five in Tulsa because it's six o clock IN NY.C!
Are you serious?
You know, I don't get this. A month ago, these people were my friends. You know, just because I'm in charge doesn't mean I'm a different person.
You're not gonna need my help?
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you! And you are about to marry a wonderful man! Hey! I'm marrying a dead woman!
All right look, am I serious, okay? Tomorrow at 3:30 I am going down to the courthouse.
This is probably the wrong thing to be worrying about, but... you're getting ham on my only tie.
Don't try to sway her. I'm your only chance to have a baby. Okay, let's go.
Hi, um, I'm account number 7143457. And, uh, I don't know if you got any of that, but I would really like a copy of the tape.
Well, we're-we're hanging out in here!
Ah!
I'd like a Google Card.
Seriously, we're gonna do this?
Probably because...
No. But I'm sure 'tomatoes' does.
Happy Anniversary, 10 months!
YEAH!!! YES!!!
In London?
Before!!
Uh, if you say so sir.
Oh, that's not true. You had an impact on me, I mean, it's 15 years later and we're still best friends. Doesn't that count for something?
Yeah, it's annoying, isn't it?
Okay, so this time I won't quit!
Okay, let me just straighten out your helmet there.
That was one of the worse things ever. And not just on TV.
There's no-one around. Why don't we just take this one?
Wait! Wait! We'd really love it if you could be there.
I'm leaving you.
That's what our friends call us.
Okay.
Well, maybe it was God, doing me.
That's a good thing actually, because ah, he used to have me rehearse with him.
Wish I could switch with someone. I really don't wanna sit with Allen Iverson over there.
Ooh, not so tight... I'm sorry, just give me one more chance.
Good idea. Where do you want to go to lunch?
Woah, woah, that's not pretty!
How about the dinosaur twins in the other room? No-one is manning that wall!
Well, I-I just didn't think it was funny sir.
I got that!
No-no all kids are embarrassed by their parents, you'd have to come up with a whole new word for what I went through. When I was in High School, he used to come to all of my swim meets dressed as a different Hollywood starlet. Y'know it's hard enough to be fourteen. You're skinny. You're wearing speedoes-That your mom promised that you would grow into! And you look up into the stands and there's your dad cheering you on dressed as Carmen Miranda. We was wearing a headdress with real fruit that he will later hand out to your friends as a healthy snack!
B-bye!
Hey, you have got to try this cheesecake.
Is that a swing?
And I'm sure we're all very excited that Ross and Emily are getting married at Montgomery Hall. I mean to think, my friend getting married in Monty Hall. Ohh, come on!! Monty Hall!! Lets make a Deal!! Come on, you people!! All right, forget it!! Congratulations, Ross and Emily.
Noo.
A hot girl's at stake and all of the sudden he's Rain Man.
Just for a few seconds, so I can know what it is... Please?
We used them as pillows when we went camping.
Yes, but I just had one. Two. Two tiny cigarettes. Okay, five. A pack. Two pack...a...a carton. Three big fat cartons in two days. But it's over, I made a decision, I'm not gonna smoke anymore.
You don't like that show?
Hi.
Okay, but now see you're crying!
Hey, you know what you can do? I remember reading about this director, I think it was Orson Wells, who at the beginning of the movie would hire somebody, just so he could fire them in front of everybody. Then they would all know, who's boss.
It could've been worse, he could've shot her.
That's still yours. Okay, now remember it's a surprise party. So, when you go in, act surprised.
Yeah. Yes! Yeah.
Ok, Phoebe.
Do I still call you Ross?
I KNEW IT!!!!
So, ah... Any plans for the summer?
So you must be going to somewhere fancy to celebrate?
I believe I read that somewhere!
Okay, easy Martina. I think we should let them win the next game.
Call me!
Joey, you have to tell her what's going on! And what did it look like?!
Where's your passport?
Ok so, can I have my hat back?
