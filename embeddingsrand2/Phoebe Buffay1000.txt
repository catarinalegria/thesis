Time for your scalp massage!
Yeah Joey that is so gross!
That is so weird! I had a dream that you'd have lunch with Richard.
Yeah. That's what you really want. Yeah, I don't want to be the reason you're unhappy, that would just make me unhappy, and I really don't want to be the reason I'm unhappy.
Okay. Oh but don't tell them Monica's pregnant because, they frown on that.
That she's gonna move in with you and maybe then she'll fall in love with you and then when she finds out you're already married, she'll just be happy. Y'know? You're just, you're very sad.
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know. You know, I mean, on the one hand, Mother may I? But y'know on the other hand... No. No, I can't. We're friends. No, oh, no. I don't want to risk what we have.
Well, of course it smells really bad. You have your head inside a turkey's ass!
Oh, Paolo, hi, what are you doing here?
Hey!
"Are you in there little fetus? In nine will you come great us? I will buy you some Adidas."
Monica! That's not right! Start with where.
Oh right, maybe I'll just go home.
Um, Chandler, Ross, this is Robert.
Okay, you have to switch with me! Monica is driving me crazy!
Are you sure it wasn't an oyster?
Will you excuse us, we need to talk for a moment.
How'd you know I was coming?
I'm so, so, so sorry, Joey. I definitely am gonna see you're play. I swear you're play is very important to us, thank you for your patience. You're play is the next play is the next play I'm gonna see.
Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm, who's next?
Okay. Oh no-no-no, you don't touch the guitar! First you learn here, then you learn here.
What a beautiful night to be running around the street, looking for tickets. And the wind sure made it fun.
Oh, hey, Monica, I brought back your iron.
Okay, alright, I have a question, then.
What?
Yeah, I don't know.
Good one! Yeah.
Joey, you can't make someone do something they don't want to do. Believe me, there's something I've been trying to get Mike to do in bed and there's... he's just...
No! It's a great time, come in...! WOW, hi... Oh my gosh! What are you doing here? Are you back from Minsk?
I know.
Well you certainly can't give her that stupid gumball ring.
Ooh, this is it, 74.
On the touchy.
Popes in a Volkswagen! ...I love that joke.
Thanks!
No, Mike, I don't want to kill him! I thought we were just gonna capture him and, and you know, set him free in the country side where he can maybe meet a friendly possom and a wisecracking owl.
Oh my God!
Yep.
I'm not gonna give you tips! Look don't you see that this-this...this all came together so that I could stop you from doing this.
Oh my god, I'm gonna be on TV!
Huh?
Hey! Ooh, did you do it yet?
Ooh Monica!
Don't you see? Everyone's looking at me! The plan's working! I didn't even have to take off my top yet!
Yeah.
Okay, I got a good one. Okay, umm, what is she? Like 12?
And this time, they've ganged up to form one giant, super hat.
But I like it here!
Oh, c'mon, like you tell me everything.
Oh! What what what! ...Hi.
Oh my God! I know who the father is...
Fine! Fine! Oh-oh!
What? You'll hi-ya?
Well, no no, you have to stay back. I, I have the pox.
Sure! What?
Joey, I can't believe you would do that for me.
All right, there are no questions in the happy place. Okay, just, the warm breeze, and the moonlight flowing through the trees....
OK so isn't there a little part of you that wants to get up there?
Oh no no.
Hey, it's your Thanksgiving too, y'know, instead of watching football, you could help.
Bing, what an unusual name.
I brought you alphabet soup.
Separate performances.
Oh, well, don't tell me you want to keep more of your stuff in my uterus.
Why don't you go up there and ask him to 'step lightly, please?'
Uhuh.
Okay. Okay, let's say I bought a really great pair of shoes. Do you know what I'd hear, with every step I took? 'Not-mine. Not-mine. Not-mine.' And even if I was happy, okay, and, and skipping- 'Not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not-mine'...
Really?! Joey?! You don't say.
Hi.
And on my way over here, I stepped in gum. ...What is up with the universe?!
Okay, well y'know what, don't worry you guys, 'cause I'm-I'm gonna do this as many times as it takes to get it right.
Y'know? Ooh, you can almost smell the opium.
So, I guess this is it.
No. I'm-I'm to depressed to talk.
No, I know what a silent is I meant, what's going on with your hair?
What time? Maybe we can share a cab!
No, you're too late!!! She already took out the trash!!!
Oh whoa-whoa-whoa! Wait a minute, open up your hand; let me take a look. Quarter. Dime. Lint? Not interested in that. What's this? A Canadian coin? Get outta here!
She's right! You have to stop!
OOOOOHHHHH! Fine, I can't take it anymore! I'm putting an end to this!
Oh, you like that? You should hear my phone number.
I like our way. Oh! Chess!
Huh. Okay. Well, I'm really happy for you.
I know, I know. So sweet... and so complicated. And for a shrink, he's not too shrinky, y'know?
Alright, now I will let go if you both stop.
Well did she know you two weren't married?
Okay, that was Mike.
And a glass of tepid water.
No-no!! No!!
Hey!
Really?
Ooh, ok, that's it. Enough with the keys. No one say keys.
Oh, I would love to have kids. . . you're, you're the, you're, me play the songs that I will write for them.
No, it's positive.
YOU'RE SO GENEROUS AND KIND AND YOU'RE AMAZING IN BED IT'S OUR ANNIVERSARY!
Well, I bet that was very hard for him to do.
Wow! Five-month maternity leave, you're back for four days, kiss a co-worker, call in sick, they are lucky to have you!!
Hello?
Then he comes over! "I'm so worried about you." Uck! Be a man!
Oh no! Why not?
Oh, okay. Listen, thanks for everything, Mon.
Are you still mad at us?
Uh-huh.
Okay, so The Plaza! Okay, we'll get us some Mai Thai's, maybe no more for you though.
Okay.
Let's see! Oh, you know who's great? Sandy Poophack.
Love it!
That play?
I know... I mugged Ross!
I've never done that.
Well, I think you're gonna appreciate it the crap out of this one.
See no-no, I made a batch and I froze it, and this is the only one left.
Not with that attitude! Now, haul ass!
Ooh, Joey.
Yeah, but you've known Rachel since High School and you cannot just cut her out of your life.
Well, like acoustic folksy stuff. You know? But right now I'm working on a couple 'Iron Maiden' covers.
Yea. Can I please, please, please talk to one of the best men? This is going to be the last time I promise.
Wow! That is a bad audition.
Okay, what about after I give you these candies?
Noo!
Oh my god! Where are you?
Archery?
But... I'm ready, so, just deal.
Yeah, I wanted to call and tell you that there's no hard feelings for firing me.
You know... You're gonna be really, really hard to get over.
Which Richard?
No, no maybe 'cause it's harder to raise them, and the added expense, and...
Okay.
Why, what happened?
Oh no.
Why? Why do I have to learn?
Yeah? And, he's-he's so centered and mature and confident.
Ok, well, who identified the tone of this restaurant as pretentious comma garlicky?
What-what's up?
Whoa-whoa-whoa, you guys, do you know anything about chicks?
Hey look, you guys, it's snowing!
Huh. Okay, Mr. Perkazet.
Good idea!
Oh! Ooh! Oh Monica! It's so beautiful.
You're there!
Oh please, somebody tell me I don't have to go to work today!
That is so cruel! Why? Why would a parent name their child Bethel?
Aaah... you're not good at this...
Hurry! Monica's gonna make you pack! She's got jobs for everyone! Now, it's too late for me, but save your selves!
Don't even get me started on yours!
WHAT! WHY?
Stilts?
Um, no, huh-uh. One of my clients died on the massage table today.
Huh?
You wanna do it right now?
Hey Rach, you wanna get some coffee?
Tails!
Yeah, you're right. How's the Mrs.?
Fine! But please God; tell me how to stop them from going off!
Yeah, I should probably take it back. Ooh, but you know what? While I'm at the police station, I could check their Ten Most Wanted lists because my friend Fritzy has been like number 11 forever, so this could be her year!
Ohhh!!!
Alright, so that leaves Chandler.
We didn't have sex.
Excuse me! Can you tell me where I can find Earl? He's the supply manager around here.
Oh yeah.
Now, what is this?
Rach, it's gonna be okay! You guys are the best!
Ewww!!!
Wanna go see a movie?
Oh, just as well, I broke this one.
What?!
You're not serious, right?
Because, I'm just, I'm incredibly anal and an unbelievable control freak.
Ok, have a good break-up.
Yeah?
Oh, yeah! Are you telling me you... you're not even... a little turned on by Monica, right now?
It's so weird, I have never been fired from anything before!
No, not Phoebe, Dr. Philange. Oh no! You have it too!
Ok, you're gonna have to not touch my ass.
You've lasted a whole year. Good for you.
Ohh, they're having a great time with their Aunt Phoebe! Aunt Rachel hasn't been helpful at all. So, do you miss me?
Why? It's fun, it's different, no-one else has a name like it.
Then change it back!
What?! What else did you do?
No, lets just draw straws.
Oh my God!
Y'know, for once, I am going to sit down and try to watch one of these things. .
Yes you do! This is your third divorce! You love divorce so much you're probably gonna marry it! Then it won't work out and you're gonna have to divorce it, divorcing guy. I'm so drunk.
Oh that's all right. I'm still full from your homemade potato chips.
Do you have my birth certificate?
Pat Sajak?
You just abandoned your whole belief system. I mean, before, I didn't agree with you, but at least I respected you. How, how, how are you going to go into work tomorrow? How, how are you going to face the other science guys? How, how are you going to face yourself? Oh! That was fun. So who's hungry?
That's right.
Wait, you can't take the money out.
: Dear Ms. Green, thank you for your inquiry, however... oh...
Okay. So, this wire is connected to this wire which plugs into here. Okay so, to get the beeping to stop all I have to do... Well done, Pheebs. What do you want from me?!!!!!!!
So-so how long did that last for you and Chandler?
No spark? Didn't you sleep together?
All right, I've never been engaged and I've never really been married, but I can only tell you what my mother told me. Whenever you have doubts or fears or anxieties about a relationship, do not communicate them to your husband.
Oh, hi, Mrs. Waltham. I need to speak with ether one of the best men, or Ross's sister Monica.
Uh, hello, this is Ross Geller's personal physician, Dr. Philange.
Oh, good for you.
Yes, she jumped right back up.
What's going on?
I have to tie my shoe, so you go ahead, I'll catch up.
I gotta call him. Just to talk to him, there's no harm in that.
Of course! Yeah, I was uh, umm Thigh Mega Tampon.
Well you all know that I'm a pacifist so I'm not interested in war in any way. But y'know what? When the revolution comes, I will have to destroy you all. Not you Joey.
Ohh! You made up!
Because I think it means more to you.
Umm, it's negative.
I can't say, I just thought it was really good... and... maybe would be worth something some day.
Oh! Which can either mean you're having a baby or you're gonna make a scientific discovery!
You mean the-Okay by siadic, you mean the towel covered portion.
"Crazy underwear, creepin' up my butt. Crazy underwear, always in a rut. Crazy under--wear..." Oh No! What is he doing here? All right, just keep playing, just keep playing. You'll get through this; you'll be fine. Okay, thank you. And, as always no one talk to me after the show.
Okay, I know. Hold on. Hey Ross?
Ooh, oh, I've gotta go. Whoa, oh, head rush. One more, and then I have to go. Cool!
Yay! I love drunk Monica!
Oh, I'm Phoebe Buffay. I'm one of Ross's best friends.
Umm, well I, I kinda had a little chat with Alice, and I sort of made her see why you two shouldn't be together, y'know. And you're gonna see it to, one day, you really, really will.
Oh? And how will you know what time to come over?
But you-you can't leave me with them! We-we're a team! We're playing a zone! They're gonna triple team me!
Oh my god, we killed Bob!
Yeah.
No, I think we killed it.
Sorry.
Oh, I don't know. Umm, how about the fact that the underwear out there on the telephone pole is yours from when you were having sex with Fun Bobby out on the terrace.
Thank you, mister Bag.
Eeeee--ohh!! God!
Who would you rather sleep with Monica or Rachel?
Yeah.
Oh! Well, if that's what you want...
He's just trying to show Joey how much he means to him.
Oooh, I like that, "daddy"
Oh, did the little rich boy have a problem with the butler? Yes, mine's worse!
Now what is Fabutec?
I'm out of here.
About 20 minutes. CLOSING CREDITS
Ross?
Gooood luck! Gooood luck! We all wish you good luuuuuuuuck!!!
Aw, dammit!
He was a lawyer!
Nothing. Nothing.
Oh yeah. That's me.
Ok, look, before you even start, I'm not denying evolution, ok, I'm just saying that it's one of the possibilities.
Yes. We're here to make a rather sizeable donation to the children.
How about just the bridemaids?
Oh you don't know.
Enchante.
Yeah?
Oh, thank God, 'cause that thing's really creepy! Look, there's Chandler.
Hi, guys.
Sure! Look, ok, bottom line: I love Mike... David! David. I love David. Don't look at me that way, Roseanne Rosannadanna!
That's it. Just relax.
I will replace it, I promise. I feel so terrible.
You can open your eyes now.
You were?
Yeah, from now on everyone you lurk, I'm gonna lurk first! You move on to someone else, I'm gonna be one step ahead of you, every single time! And then I'll be on your ass every hour of every day 'til Monday, because that's when I go home. When do you leave?
Hey! Umm, well, only okay because I just got back from, from the hospital.
I'm sorry, I can't do this. I'm not an actor.
There's sooo much you don't know.
Uh.
Yeah.
You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it kinda looks like an old potato.
Yeah that was lucrative! Smart like your brother!
Uh huh. Why is that?
Yeah and I-I found you one too who is not a weirdo.
Yeah, you've... you know, sort of been like a dad to me. I mean, you've always, you know, looked out for me and shared your wisdom...
Oh that'd be me. Sir. After you.
Oh, I hate this. Everything's changing.
She seems fine now.
Yeah, I... Well y'know I-I mean I missed the-the semi-finals, so I'd just be lost.
Oh, which museum?
What you got?
No! No, she said you actually proposed to her.
Yeah me too.
Yes, doctor.
What?!
Oh before I forget, are you coming to Mike's piano bar tonight?
Hey. Look, I know you've been really depressed lately, so I brought someone over to cheer you up. Right outside this door is a real, live, furry playmate.
You're welcome. And thank you for "Science Boy". I learned a lot from him.
She is so great! I miss her.
I cannot believe I can't find a selfless good deed! Y'know that old guy that lives next to me? Well, I snuck over there and-and raked up all the leaves on his front stoop. But he caught me and force-fed me cider and cookies. Then I felt wonderful. That old jackass!
Ok, um, hi, hello, hi, ok, so, um, this is a song about a love triangle between three people that I made up. Um, it's called, um, "Two of Them Kissed Last Night".
So uh, now look at the picture...
Hey.
No, you?
Oh! Oh! Oh no!! You swore!
So, what did Rachel say when you told her you were still married to her?
I didn't say anything yet!
Oh my God.
Yeah, totally.
Umm, no, it's a purse. And there's a thermos in it.
Am I crazy or does this totally go?!
Wh-why is that the best part?
Monica! We lived together for years! I've seen you naked!
Maybe it was the guy.
Okay.
Ok.
Uh-huh, what?
Oh, you're such a gentleman. Come on! We're going to my place!
Hi!
Hey.
Hi!
No!! Hey-hey that's not a Nutter-Butter, that's just an old Wonton!
So?
Okay, I can't believe that Monica and Chandler are getting married. I remember talking about this day with Rachel while we were showering together, naked.
leave...
No I'm not! You are!
Well, how could it not be breezy, no, 'cause, you're, you're in such a breezy place.
I know, yeah. Ok, talk to him.
Okay, okay, okay, the black. But, oh, do you have black, with the little strappys?
Tell him it's for you.
Oh, there's no such thing as an innocent burger.
Yeah, all right.
No. No! No! ...So, um, do you think he's doing any better than he was this morning?
So you guys'll stay here and hang out with me?
Yeah!
Oh, okay.
I can smell it a little, bake the pie.
I'm sorry, I'm late.
Ohh, yes it would.
Okay, stop! Larry, okay, can't you just be Larry and not Larry the health inspector guy? Y'know I mean it was really exciting at first but now it's like, okay, so where are we gonna eat ever?
No, you have to let me in right now!!
Oh.
That's it? That's why you won't go out with her again? So, she took some fries, big deal!
I'll get it, okay. Hi, Monica and Rachel's. Yeah, just a second, can I ask who's calling. Oh, ew, it's Michelle! Ew! She, she must have that Caller Id thing. You should get that.
Really, it doesn't mean anything. I mean, you know, Monica refers to Chandler as Richard all the time!
Yeah! You're the best!
What?! I think he's cute.
Okay, look I-I-I do something nice, okay? I'll-I'll fill her ice trays.
Okay.
How'd he take it?
But, also, what happened between you and your Mom?
I'm gonna find a selfless good dead. I'm gonna beat you, you evil genius.
Oh, yeah! Okay! Great! Go, man, go put on your shoes, and, and march out there and meet her! Oh, wait, no, no you have to take a shower, 'cause, eww. No, you know what you have to answer her, answer her first. No, no, you know what make some coffee 'cause its too much.
Yeah?
Do it!
Well, kinda. Yeah. Yeah.
Cool Aunt Phoebe. I am pretty cool!
No, whad'ya mean? He's not British.
Well, this is very generous!
Bye, fat ass.
Ohhh.
This pregnancy is throwing me all off.
Yeah absolutely!
There's a reset button?! Ugh, thank you! Thank you! There's a reset button! My God! Why didn't I see that! Reset button, reset button, where is there a reset button? Oh here it is! Oh! Ohh, God!
You're welcome.
I would love it. Consider it forgotten... But just so you know... however and whenever you decide to propose, I promise I'll say yes. Whether... whether, you know, it is in a basketball game, or in sky writing, or you know, like some lame guy in a cheesy movie who hides it in the cake.
Oh yeah? Come and get it.
Did I use that already today? I'm sorry.
Yes.
Please.
I thought you meant in life.
Ah! Oh my God! You r-r-rotten boys!
I worked in a Dairy Queen, why?
Here he is.
Half full of looooovvvvve.
Why?
Umm, you might even say that she pulled a Monica. She doesn't know we switched it.
Okay If you guys have microphones in there too, I didn't mean any of that. I love you.
It's-it's not negative, it's positive.
Hi Joey.
That's easy for you to say, I don't see three kids coming out your vagina!
All right, I think I'm gonna head out.
Do you want a refill?
Can you?
So, I'm here, ready to play.
Oh, you, too.
Yeah, sorry boys, this ride's closing.
Hey Rach, will you come with me to a dressing room?
I'm having a really good time!
Oh!
She cancelled! My namesake cancelled on me!
I don't see her.
All right, I'm gonna go take a pregnancy test, right now.
Yeah, I've been around.
Look David, if... if you had never left, then... yeah, we'd probably still be together right now, but... you did leave, and I-I'm with Mike and I really care about him...
Smelly cat, smell-ly cat, what are they feeding you? Everybody.
Oh, okay. Hi new dad.
Doy! Probably right before she lost it!
There we go.You know what, if we were in prison, you guys would be, like, my bitches.
I'm sorry you guys but, you know, Mike's got his brother and his friends from school so... you know, you were-you were... if it helps you, you were next in line, you just-you just missed the cut.
Ok, here are the birthday candles. Where's the birthday cake?
Yeah?
Can't a girl finish a song around here?
Okay!
Oh my god!
Oh, I'm sorry. Is that annoying? And speaking about being selfish in bed, how's Whitney?
Oh, en chante.
Oh let me guess, and you wanna have them all at the same time and you wanna have them for your brother.
Okay, I would ring the bell to distract him and then I would knock the gun out of his hand with a Chinese throwing star.
What? Can't you see I'm in the middle of something? Ooh, I like it.
I miss you too!!!!
I know about your feelings.
Nesele Toulouse.
Yeah, but did they have to shoot him down? I mean, that was just mean.
What?!
Hmm, did you talk to Gary about the moving in thing?
Yep, we shook on it. Yeah but believe me that is not how he wanted to seal the deal.
Ready... GO!
No, don't look directly at them!
Oh, thank you. I hope... I hope you know how much you mean to me.
Wait! Oh wait! Oh no!
Come on, you know, Thanksgiving. Ooh, you got the bigger half. What'd you wish for?
I don't use a curling iron.
Oh, interesting you should call me that! Now that I may never have one!
Oh, it's so pretty. This must have cost him a fortune.
And! Y'know what Jake says? That women's underwear is actually more comfortable. And he loves the way the silk feels against his skin.
No, he really hates it. But he's gonna let me keep my box of human hair! So you got to pick your battles. But the good news is, Gladys is yours!
Oh, you say someone's name enough, they turn around.
Your nails.
I can't. I can't. She dumped me, I mean I totally trusted her and then one day it was 'Okay, bye Pheebs' gone. Y'know what the saddest part is, when we were playing together, that was like the most fun I've ever had in like all my lives.
Hey.
No, you don't! She's going to Paris! She is going to meet somebody. Do you know how many hot guys there are in Paris? It's... It's a city of Gunthers!
Ooh! I know what you could make! I know! Oh, you should definitely make that thing... you know, with the stuff? You know, that thing... with the stuff...? OK, I don't know.
Why? Just 'cause you're too lazy to get up off your touchie?
There he goes, your fiance.
I can say I told you so but she's kinda doing that for me.
Umm, Gene.
Hi.
Better!
Well you obviously didn't see Chucky 3.
Ooh, y'know what, I think it's time for puppy to go out again. Come on, let's go to the balcony.
Umm, my friend, Bonnie. She just always thought Ross was really cute, and now that you two aren't together, she asked if I could set it up, but if you're not cool with it...
Yeah, yeah I got that.
What?!!
I wouldn't say never, you know there's that guy well what about ok well there's gotta be someone.
Oh my God!
Hey, you!
Umm, I...I just think you don't expect someone so hot to be so sweet.
Yes! Now, she feels terrible! She really wants to make up! You gotta find her.
What?
Oh really? She said she wants to go away with you?
Maybe the overlords needed them to steer their spacecrafts.
Dance karate?
Ohhh!
No, I know, I know, that this is Frank's life, y'know. Y'know, I don't want to be all judgmental, y'know, but this is sick, it's sick and wrong!
Wait a minute.
Yes, but there isn't always time!
Yeah, I know, he's sweet, but it's just not fun anymore, you know? I don't know if it's me, or his hunger strike, or, I don't know.
Yeah! Here! Oh no, these are the trick deck. Okay. Here yes. Okay.
And maybe I could teach Ben about the Christmas skull and how people die.
Oh God, I tried everything to make myself feel better. I even tried writing a song about it... but... I can't think of anything that rhymes with AARRGGHH!! Hey Monica, I really need your help getting through this...
No-no, oh, I'm fine with the age thing y'know, until it starts sticking it's tongue down my little brother's throat!
What I said you had...
I'm on top of the world, looking down on creation and the only explanation I can find, is the wonders I've found ever since...
Your welcome, oh please not the one with the turtles.
I wanna hear "The Sound."
Okay! Okay! I'm so glad you're here.
Hey, I never got to hear who you guys would pick to be your girlfriend.
Hey, are Ross and Rachel back?
It's slang for pregnant.
Bye Chandler.
I know it's le poo right now, but it'll get better.
No...I really wanted to know how you feel about it.
Oh, are we gonna trash that place?
Do it do it do it!
Don't tear it.
No. No! It's just y'know first, I wanna take off all my clothes and have you rub lotion on me.
Okay, bye!
Well actually, I know what time Chester and Marcia said.
Oh, hey, y'know what? Tell them that bone story.
Wash your hands!!!
Hey what are you guys looking at?
Yeah, Chandler why don't you take a walk? This doesn't concern you.
Monica, Monica, you know what gets out hummus.
I've never been more convinced of your love for her.
Nah, I don't feel like playing.
So how did this happen? Did she, did she lure you to an early bird dinner?
Let's see. Oh my God! Oh... But no! No! You can't-you can't hire him, because that-it's not professional. Umm, this is for me yes? Thanks.
ok.
Hey.
Umm, the street. Come on, let's go to the street. Ooh, listen, don't go onto the balcony until after I get back.
Okay. Okay! Well okay, who do we know that's coming? Me. Are you?
So that's why she gave you a naked picture of herself.
Remembered what?
Yeah, I understand.
You should be. I'm very bendy. I'm gonna kiss you now.
It's interesting that you lost. Now, I forget, do you like to lose?
Oh well, what do you know, there goes my identical twin sister. Just walkin' along looking like me. What, is this just like a freakish coincidence, or did you know she takes this train?
Hey oh, Rach wait! Do you want to go to a movie tonight?
Oh.
Hi Monica.
Shut it down.
No! No, you can't arrest me! No!! I won't go back! I won't go back to that hell hole!!
Oh, I like my job.
Hey!
Oh that's right!
Why, I must have been in missile training the day they taught that.
Well, one of you has to take the first step! And it should be you, because she's the one who's leaving. It's harder for her!
Yeah, and maybe that you're a real
Yeah. Yeah, I remember trying to steal a cardboard cutout of Evander Holyfield from a Foot Locker.
Build the unit Cinderelly, lay the tile Cinderelly.
You know like... uh okay... uh... 'Could that report be any later?'
Damn, that window is clean.
And all of the sudden his hands weren't the problem anymore.
'Hi, I have Phoebe Buffay returning a page. Okay, well, um, she's in her car I'll have to patch you through.'
Okay, so after this audition, who decides who gets it?
Oh, no, no, no, no. You know what, he's not into that stuff anymore. He quit for me.
Why?
Ross, please! My make-up!
Ohh, I lost my mom to suicide.
Wow! Okay, dude alert! And who is this guy?
OK, no. For your information I'm going to see him so I can put all those feeling behind me. OK, and the reason I'm dressed like this is because I think it's nice to look nice for your gay husband.
Yeah!
Are these for rent! I thought people were just bragging!
No, I've got work and then I'm proposing..
I'm doing okay. I think it's going well. Do you think they're having fun? Am I talking to fast?
This is Monica.
Wait a minute, I see what's happening here. You're threatened.
Wow, you told your dad the truth.
God, that is the nicest kitchen.
well it was awful every time I thought about what you said I started crying.
You're the best. Thanks. Oh!
Listen, I think I've left something here.
Give it!
What?
Oh, yeah. What's this?
I'm telling you, if you want to take care of that thing, you should go to my herbal guy.
Don't be worried about that! Your tombstone can say whatever you want it to say! It could say, Ross Geller, Good at Marriage! Y'know? Mine's gonna say Phoebe Buffay, Buried Alive.
Okay, yeah well, good news, you're going to have three babies.
It's for our wedding day! Right, now, is this guy gay or straight, because one of us gonna have to start flirting.
Oh, I missed you so much!
Well, I snapped! Okay? You weren't taking the class seriously.
I started that!
Yeah, see you later!
Okay! I just-I didn't know that you are a lesbian.
Okay.
If you had to, what would you give up, food or sex?
Yeah?
Yeah?
Okay. Okay. I-Okay umm...this...I-I sent my friend Joey in here to find out stuff about you. Umm y'know, if it helps you came off great. A lot better than I'm coming off right now.
Okay, so... allright... Which dress? You can say "neither".
Wait-wait-wait, wait! Puppies. Cute or ugly?
Yeah, but only a genius would swallow a sonic blaster gun.
Well, this is none of my business.
What?!
Yeah!
Well, because we thought you knew!! It's so obvious! God, that would be like telling Monica, "Hey, you like things clean." Or, y'know, "Hey, Joey, you're gay."
That is a different phone.
Ecoutez, je vais vous dire la verite. C'est mon petit frere. Il est un peu retarde.
Noooo!!
Well, the interview...
Yeah okay... yeah, your mom... okay... She looks nice, I can talk to her.
That's not mine.
Yum-my!
There it is! Oh, look at that! Isn't Mother Nature amazing?
Ugh, it's so exhausting waiting for death. Ohh, by the way, do you think you could-
Ohh. . .K. How come?
Sure you can! Give them some blocks, put them in a playpen!
What the smell from Joey's? No, I can hardly smell it over here.
Yeah, y'know, people can be so self-involved.
It isn't?
Someday.
Hey. Ooh! Don't sit down!
Yeah, I-I can't-I mean y'know I was trying to be really y'know okay and upbeat about it, I just-I feel so dwarfed by your musical gift. I...
Ohh! I did not get that.
Yeah, okay, listen, umm, Mom, I hope you know you still mean a lot to me. And you're welcome to come back anytime.
Yeah, I definitely. I don't like the name Ross.
No, yeah, we never find them! She's always best at us that wily minx.
Oh, how do you play the shadow game?
Phoebe-Phoebe-Phoebe-Phoebe-Burrrrr!
To Ross.
Oh, I...
All right, everyone calm down! Everyone calm down! I have something that I would like to say! Who here likes Ross? Of course you don't like him! He-he didn't give you any money, he raised his own hand when I asked, "Who hear likes Ross," and he's wearing two nametags! I-I'll be honest with you guys, when I first met Ross I didn't like him at all! But then once I got to know him I saw that he's really sweet and caring and very generous. I mean, all I'm saying is don't judge Ross before you get to know him all right? I mean, I like all you guys now, but when I first meet you y'know Kurt, I thought, y'know abrasive drunk, umm Lola, mind numbingly stupid! And okay, you guys Gold-digger, cradle robbing perv! So, I think you all know what I mean.
Central... Park!
How did you do that?
Oh! Yeah!
Joey? How could you just let them leave?
Okay, we have like ten minutes. Do you want me to get into that now?!
Hey!
Chandler, you called Janice! That's how much you wanted to be with someone!
Okay, London 1...
How much was it?
Oh I'm kinda part of this.
Uh-huh!
All right, I will. No, I will. But umm, y'know just remember that it's still really early, okay so, if it says that I'm not pregnant, that doesn't mean that I'm not gonna get pregnant, okay and, and just please, just so I don't go completely nuts, just try not put all your hopes on this.
That was a test and you just failed.
What?
I'm really glad you guys are okay but, I just keep thinking what would happen if-if you two actually had hooked up.
Oh, this is my friend Roger.
Totally.
Damn it woman, pull yourself together! Have some pride, for the love of God.
uh huh how do I look.
No, I don't think this was your shot. I mean, I don't even think you just get one shot. I really believe big things are gonna happen for you, I do! You've gotta just keep thinking about the day that some kid is gonna run up to his friends and go 'I got the part! I got the part! I'm gonna be Joey Tribbiani's ass!'.
I know, but that creep that I went on that date with goes to there so I have to find a new one. I also have to find a new video store, a new bank, a new adult bookstore, a new grocery store...
Yeah, come on. You know you want it, you know you want it too, come on. Let's just be bad, it'll feel so good.
What?
All right, so promise you're gonna wait for her to call you?
Duh!! Christmas!
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
This is the happiest dog in the world. I borrowed him from my friend Wendy. Now, you can only keep him until he cheers you up. And he will cheer you up!
All right, I'll see you downstairs then.
Well, uhm, back in my mugging days, you know, I, uhm, I worked St. Marc's Comics.
What? Oh, are you pregnant too?!
Oh, Ross, Mon, is it okay if I bring someone to your parent's anniversary party?
I don't know. You could tie her up, she could tie you up; you could eat stuff off each other...
Is it a meatball sub?
Hey you guys wait! Guys! This place is so much better than London! Okay? This lady dressed like Cleopatra gave me a coupon, 99 cent steak and lobster dinner. Huh!
You think?
Really? You're moving on from Ross?
I'd love to.
Hey, were the hell have you been?!
Oh, look, he's closing his eyes again.
No, it sucks. I was saving up to buy a hamster.
You are unbelievable! I spent so much time finding the perfect girl for you, you know. Mary Ellen is really smart and cute and loose.
Maybe just 10 minutes for you.
Yeah. And, first here's a gift.
By the way, it's a costume party.
This used to be your room? Wow! You must've been in really good shape as a kid.
Okay sure!
Oh.
Oh God. So-so you're making porn movies.
Okay, 'cause right after my mom killed herself, I was just in this really bad place, y'know personally. So, I just thought that it'd make me feel better if I wrote to Sesame Street, 'cause they were so nice when I was a little kid! No one ever wrote back.
All right, you go.
You don't need Janice for that, you've got us. We...
A-Allright, well... I'll call the cab company.
Happy Chanukah, Monica! May your Christmas be snowy, Joey! Happy New Year, Chandler and Ross. Spin the draddle, Rachel!
Oh!
Sure.
And tell them that in 2 weeks I will once again be a masseuse in good standing!
Hey!
OK, that makes no sense. Why would the villagers worship a pharmacist?
No, no-no, she was a human lady. This is the spirit of my Mom Lily, the one who killed herself.
But everybody sings. It's so much fun! Last time this adorable old man got out there, forgot all of the words, flipped outand everyone booed him off the stage. So funny.
Yeah.
Look everybody, look at my new dollhouse!!
I know.
No! No, that you and Rachel are engaged!
Hands.
Okay. Ooh, I'm setting the phone down. But I'm still here! Just don't go anywhere I'm still here. Don't-don't switch or anything, 'cause I'm, I'm right here. Just one sec. One sec! One second!! Wait! One second! Just...
What is this? What's going on?
Ok, thanks. Sorry, again
Okay.
Ok, this is the most romantic disease I've ever had.
Hi!
Great!
Oh yay! Great! Okay, what room number is he in?
Well, why are you doing this anyway?
Sure. Do you need some floss?
Well yeah, I lied before.
Oh. Finally! Oh.
So how's the piano playing going?
Oh, yeah, they're falling in love all over again.
Yeah, okay. Hey, wait. Do you know what kind of birth control she was using?
So, I figured it out.
All right, it seems pretty simple. Your first line is "My name is Claude", so, just repeat after me. "Je m'appelle Claude".
Na-uh, no, we are all responsible for our own babies.
All right, betting and wagering of any kind, are, I'm sure, not permitted in the happy place. Okay. Just-just, you know, the-the lovely waterfalls, and the, the trickling fountains. And the-the calming sounds of the babbling brook....
Ok, don't get me started on gravity.
Yes. But I left in the Ys. 'Cause, y'know, "sometimes y". Uh, I also have something else for you.
500 bucks at a flea market?!
Oh, hey, hey Nick the boxer let's see what you got. All right ya, put 'em up. Come on.
You know that's... that's her.
You know, I might know somebody. Hey, how about you set me up with someone, and we double date!
Oh, I'll get it.
Yeah!
Ugh, what a kiss ass.
Bread, so you never go hungry.
Okay, what did we say was your one gift to us?
He's right though, the '74 is absolute piss.
Eww, look. Ugly Naked Guy lit a bunch of candles.
Y'know what? I'm not talking to you! You go back to sleep! And you, are you a rapist?!
Oh look it's Parker!
Okay. Umm, oh! Okay, I see a circle.
Maybe not! Y'know? Seriously, three babies are a handful maybe they're y'know, looking for a chance to unload one of them. Listen, I-I hate to miss an opportunity just because I didn't ask! Y'know?
Ooh, I have to tell you something.
Okay, not a fan of the tough love.
They give you away! There's just-there's just too much wisdom in there. Just put some tea bags on there for like 15 minutes.
Good God man don't anger it.
Both it is, thank you.
Hey, Joey! Hey! Ooh! Ooh! I just say someone on the-that looks just like you on the subway. And I was gonna go over and say 'hi!' but then I figured, he doesn't care if he looks like you.
I'm just saying, this woman, I mean she's fictitious. No?
Okay, they're just talking...
You remember her from my birthday party two years ago. She's yeah, like, average height, medium build, bald...
m'ap.
Thank you.
No, Jack and the Beanstalk.
Hey! Oh, how did baby shopping go?
You're all invited to bite me!
Ohh, that's so nice! How great! Well, where? Where's the trip?!
Oh, and great! You might as well bring me my book, it's on the counter in your apartment.
How many beeps?
Yeah! And look, see how they expand as the baby grows? And then after the baby's born, they're great for shoplifting melons.
Ohhh! My God! For tiny salt!
But we've only had one job.
Okay, so it's probably just the Ross thing then.
Talking to Ross.
Okay, you can totally say no, but umm, would it be okay with you if I set Ross up on a date?
Yeah, and they've been coming by all day. They love it!
Please don't be a space ship. Please don't be a space ship. Oh thank God! How could you be beeping?! I just disconnected you! I took out your battery! How can...
We ruined everything.
Oh. Ah-uh.
Really? You think?
I think David would probably wanna hear a few lectures.
Umm, Chandler, Monica, this is Don.
What about this?
Taffy, really? I've never had any.
Listen, Mike, if you were Swedish and you were saying the word "lorkins" what flowers would that be?
Well, he wants to do some ecclectic, so he's looking for someone who can, you know, create the entire menu.
Good for you!
Oh wait, my grandmother's dead.
I see what you're doing!
Wow, Frank. I think we just ran out of kids.
You're right.
Hey, dude!
OK, fine, if it means that much to you I'll get rid of Bob.
Yeah. I was just in there. He introduced himself and the next thing I know, we're making out. You know.
He said that, um, he understands how sex can be like, a very emotional thing for a woman and he was just afraid that I was gonna get all, y'know, like, 'ohh, is he gonna call me the next day' and, y'know, 'where is this going' and, ya know, blah-la-la-la-la. So he said he wanted to hold off until he was prepared to be really serious.
No I didn't!
Okay.
I don't know. I don't know. I can't lie to him again. Oh no I-no! I'm just gonna press my breasts up against him.
Because I just didn't know how much I wanted it. And I love you, and I wanted to live with you.
Those are my shoes.
Well, if you don't want your mother to move in with you, just tell her.
Which means she had a couple spritzers and a quick peck on the cheek.
I know. Oh, like you would drink her coffee after what you did to her with Van Damme.
But if-no look, okay. These jerks might not care about you, but the universe does! And that says a lot!
All right, wait just one more second. Hi, it's Phoebe and Rachel's. Please leave a message, thanks!
No-no, I know that, but I just have to make enough money for the second part of my plan.
What's with all the bottles of liquor?
Hi!
Uh, Joe?
Sure!
Oh.
Ohh, you guys, remember that cute client I told you about? I bit him.
Ok. Hello everyone and thank you all for being here tonight. So tomorrow's the big event and some of you might not know, but Mike and I didn't get off to the best start. . My friend Joey and I decided to fix each other up with friends so I, I... oh I... hum... I gave it a lot of thought and I fixed him up with my friend Mary Ellen who couldn't be here tonight because... it's not important... she is in rehab. Anyway, so, ok, Joey said that he was fixing me up with his friend Mike, only he didn't have a friend Mike so he just brought, uhm, my Mike and, and but despite, you know... it got... it got good. Ok, I wanna take a moment to mention my mother, who couldn't be here...
My Saturn dealership.
...Oh crap!
No, now I feel bad. You wanna go to the concert.
Yeah but, Mischa is so interested in you, that Sergei and I haven't been able to say two words to each other.
No, no, he hasn't been around.
Well tell that to them. Oh! You can't, their dead.
Hi.
I'm kind, caring, and sweet. What's Monica like?
I got married! Could someone get me a coat, I'm freaking freezing.
Joey! Wow, you didn't rip off any buttons.
All right, c'mere, gimme your feet.
You got me.
Ok, you can do this. It's just like pulling off a Band-aid. Just do it really fast, and then the wound is exposed.
Oh he's like a...
I've had that dog there for three days and Chandler had no idea. He's not so smart.
Ok, do you know how to go from D to A minor?
Fine. But you can't help me develop my new universal language.
Ross!
Oh, totally. Oh, God, oh, she seemed so happy too.
And they were serving franks which is his first name minus the s at the end. And there was a rotisserie with spinning chicken.
Really, can I hear some of it.
Okay-Oop! Too late! I'm leaving! Come on Chandler let's go!
Okay, I'm hearing.
Hi, yeah, hi! I'm umm, Phoebe Buffay, and I have babies coming out of me.
Wait. Why was he yelling at her? He's the one who slept with someone else.
Are you kidding. He is so considerate of my feelings and... you know I think... you'd also like to know that he is a very gentle lover.
Ooh, I love that place! So, no.
I've found....
Oh, there they are!
Hey. Ooh Ross! How'd the conversation go?
Oh! Hi!
Rachel Green? Son of a bitch, she came back?
Are you leaving "The Supremes"?

Oh, this one's for Chandler. Here.
Uh-huh, got it. Ooh, I'm gonna see my dad. Wish me luck, Grandpa! Commercial
Oh no not that guy there. That guy right there.
There-there was a suicide note?! Well, do you still have it?
All right well let's see, Ross is a good father, but Joey has a boat-This is hard!
No-no wait-wait! I can't just let you hang up! Just please talk to me.
All right. If you care enough to make up that load of crap, okay.
Ooh that is definitely Chandler, Joey, or Ross. Or-or Rachel!
But now she'll never know how he feels!
Oh!
Okay, but, well, before you say no, my friend Susanne is entering her kid and compared to Emma she's a real dog!
Well, it does.
Hey!
Yeah!
What's that smell?
Yeah, maybe.
Oh! You have a window!
Wait-wait-wait-wait! So, explain something to me though, if, if nobody tagged Rachel, then isn't the play still going.
You wanna try it again?
Oh okay. All right, then I need to calm down a little.
Oh, no wonder I don't feel full.
Oh, look at little Leslie stretching in her sleep.
I love you. But I never needed a proposal from you. I just needed to know that we were headed somewhere, you know, that we had a future.
So... and?
Uh-huh! I'm so...happy.
Okay, and then this is the coffee house. This is where I play my music.
Oh my God! I don't believe it! Oh, you poor bunny.
No! But she gave me the box that it came in. It had a picture of the bike on the front. So I would sit on it and my step-dad would drag me around the backyard.
That's weird. I bet they're doing it.
Well, I, I like the idea of naming him after someone I love, and Joey and Chandler are great names. But, all right, I don't-maybe I'll just name him The Hulk.
You do?
Most likely. Okay, I'm gonna be out there.
We can't leave now! There was this one baby, Haley, who was favourite to win and she got croup, so she had to stay home! This competition just blew wide open, folks!
Now I know that they said that the umm, the hair straightener started the fire but I think I'm partly at fault. You see, I didn't, I didn't tell you but umm, but I-I had recently refilled the tissues and so y'know let's just face it, that's just kindling! So I think it's better that I stay at Joey's.
I'm pretty sure it's gun.
All right, what's going on there?
Great! Okay then it's just us girls!
Why not?
I have quarters!
Yes! You mean the world the world to me. Oh...
What when Yeller saves saves the family from the wolf and everyone's happy?
Yeah ok, well at least I didn't let some guy into the forest of my righteous truth on the first date.
I think on my shoulder.
Hey Mike, what's the capital of Peru?
Oh my God! That's the creep that you're with at the Statue of Liberty.
Ok, yeah, ok. Oh, OK.
It's really crazy! The hall, the dress, the food... I-I had no idea how expensive this stuff was!
No!!
Wow, you guys go way back then. So what are you up to these days?
That's right.
Oh yeah, you're solid. Yeah, you're just no me.
I am sorry. I am, but this wedding is just really important to me.
Why are you lying to him?
If you don't sail your boat, what do you do on it?
So, um, are you gonna call him?
Oh, Joey! Oh, okay, see I didn't recognize you wearing, in those....pants.
Well, maybe we will. Oh!
What?
Oh, yeah. That is not true. Ross, is this your fantasy?
Shh. In a minute, I'm gonna create a diversion. When I do, walk quickly to the door and don't look back.
My Father is Chuck Magioni?
Right there! That's why I'm marrying you!
OK, here I go. . . here I go. . . I'm goin'.
This place is awesome!
Huh!
So? What if they do?
Wow! This place is incredible! Sting's pen...that he gave to Phoebe. Come on! Secret passageway!
No...
Of course!
Yeah! But I'm a little shaky and nervous.
Yeah I know what I wanted to ask you. Um, can you roll your tongue? Because I can, and my Mom couldn't, and I thought y'know, I figured that was something I got from our Dad.
There you go, that's the spirit! Okay! Now, if you need money, I will lend you money, but just get moving!
Good that's a good one. Okay, Monica, anything? Y'know? Does Rachel move the phone pen?
Mr. X and Phoebe Buffay.
Joey stuffing 15 Oreos in his mouth.
Okay but that's why you have to buy it, so it can fulfil it's Christmas destiny, otherwise there gonna throw it into the chipper. Tell him, Joey
No, yeah, we never find them! She's always best at us, that wily... minx.
Easy. Step. How did it get on?
Oh! I know! It's because... he's gorgeous, and he's charming, and when he looks at you...
Here we go.
Monica, do you want us to take you home?
Oh no.
Okay, enough with the third degree! I-I've, I don't live here anymore.
Stick a fork what?
Okay. Yikes! That one doesn't look very fulfilled.
I'm sorry I won't be able to make it to your imaginary wedding, but I'm really busy that day. Yeah, I already have a unicorn baptism and a leprechaun bar mitzvah.
Oh, now you're sad and creepy, oh. You know what, I, I'm sorry I quit, okay, I just quit.
You were great. But they still made fun of you.
No.
Ooh, this is so exciting! Ooh, God, what are you going to bet?
No, huh uh, I'm sorry, no. No, I'm not some like sloppy second, charity band. You know what, there are thousands of places in this city where people would be happy to pay to hear me play. When I play, I play for me, I don't need your charity. Thank you! La la la la la la la....
Isn't there a national football league.
Well why don't you use your key?
I have this feeling that something's wrong with it. Something is wrong with the left Philange.
Maybe, because you told him not to.
We're just celebrating that Joey got his health insurance back.
Not if nothing happens. Why can't... why can't we just hang out as friends?
Oh my God, you're giving your real number.
Oh now, don't give away the farm!
I don't know, it would totally depend on her coloring and... You got the job!!
Oh, okay, you're not a pushover.
YAY!
Stop it!
I know, they're gonna be so happy together.
Oh... okay.
Paul.
Ok! I want the dolphin!
Easy. Step. How did it get on?
Not yet, no.
No, that wouldn't kill her. Ordinary embolism might.
It's a video of my friend giving birth. Could you just bring it back to your apartment?
Hi! Oh, yeah, no, I know. You're a chef. I know, and I thought of you first, but um, Chandler's the one who needs a job right now, so....
Umm, yeah! Today's.
Ewwww!!
I don't think it would have sold a million copies but it would have made a nice gift for you.
Oh, well, see, there's this guy she met at the...
Well, he's very charming.
well you not what you should feel terrible about, this could have been my serious guy he was sweet and smart and funny. Do you know how hard it is to meet a guy like that?
That's too hard. Too hard!
Yeah, but then I can be you sidekick Vunda.
Um, um, Rachel can we talk for a sec?
Oh my God! He did it?
Oh, no, I have the cutest Christmas story!
That doesn't lock does it?
Oh no.
Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Umm, could-could I get a copy of that? 'Cause Carol threw it out, she lost ours. She's such a scatterbrain, but man what a hot piece of ass.
You're not? Then why did you ask us if we wanted to go?
Yeah. Oh, can I come?
I am soo dead.
Oh, I get more because I'm dainty.
Hey!
Wow! My breasts are really strong.
Well, it was an accident...You know, it's a lot of oil and sometimes the hand just slips! Chandler: Have I got a surprise for you? Pack your bags!
And there's a country called Argentinaaaa, it's a place I've never seeeeen. But I'm told for fifty pesos you can buy a human spleen. Humaaan spleeeeen. Ole!
I don't know about that. I've got one that's worse.
Okay, don't sweat it. Chandler is nowhere around so go ahead get it out of your system. That guy's cute.
Oh my God, he's not even appreciated in his own time. I would give anything to not be appreciated in my own time!
I wanna get married.
Unless... Maybe it's too crazy about this... Alright so... you know, there is no future... but that doesn't mean we still can't have fun. You know what? Forget what I said.
Hey cool, mine too.
Thank you!
What did you do on yours?
Yeah!
I don't accept this rule. When me make plans, I expect you to show up. Okay, I can't just be a way to kill time 'til you meet someone better! Y'know boyfriends and girlfriends come and go, but this is for life!
Yes!
Ohh, that's too bad!
I sound amazing. I, I, I've never heard myself sing before. I mean, except in my own head. Oh, this is so cool, now I can hear what you hear.
Oh, I see.
Hmm, bummer.
M-M-Mole people?
Okay, ask her 'What is her current method of birth control?'
Uh-huh, yeah!
I don't know what to do with that.
Why don't you ask him out?
Oh yeah?
Okay.
Are... are you OK?
No it isn't, this is my dad, alright, I'll show you.
Oh really. Okay. let me ask you something. Yesterday at the coffee house, I went to the bathroom and when I came back, my muffin was gone-who took it?
Oh, I'm sorry, the oven mitts really freaked me out.
I love the license plate game!
That's fair! Thank you so much. Thanks. Oops, it looks like when he got the pastry chef he got you a little bit too.
She is so amazing! You have no idea.
Hey.
Well then definately don't take his name.
I think she means 'You dance a dance class'. Oh, c'mon, c'mon.
Okay, maybe it was a trick question. Um, Rachel can we do this now?
Well, you were wrong, he doesn't like me!
Sure! Tout le plaisir est pour moi, mon ami.
Yeah.
yea you know you are a bit of a drama queen.
Ya-huh, all the time, cause they are the lightning bearers.
Yeah I mean if you want to say anything to her, I'd tell her off.
Well, it was just, it was all so crazy, you know. I mean, Chandler was in the closet, counting to 10, and he was up to 7 and I hadn't found a place to hide yet. I-I-I meant to tell you, and I wrote it all down on my hand. See, all of it.
You did it!
I just-I thought you guys were doing it, I didn't know you were in love!
Ok, and I have the, uh receipt for my dinner with Nokululu Oon Ah Ah.
It's okay, he's a virgin.
Well, it's this guy I used to massage. And by massage, I mean hold down so he wouldn't turn over and flash me.
Hey, Lizzie.
Hey, you know what might help you deal with it? Think of it this way, you and Emily are in the past and you can't be mad about the past. So are you still mad about the Louisiana Purchase?
Yes!
How could you not tell Mona that Rachel is living with you?
Okay, um, oh, the zoo commercial.
All right, let just try it again. Really listen.
I was preparing you for my-didn't you think I was dead? Did that not come off?
Oh, he has a gig. I kinda like being married to a rock star, you know. My husband has a gig.
Oh, I am having the best karma this week. First, I find this woman who knew my parents, and then my client with the fuzzy back gives me his beach house.
What?
Heh?
Hi hi...Oh you have got to sing.
Fine!
Yeah!
Nah. I kept myself busy.
Oh! I won't say, 'no' to a movie!
All right, well, I just can't think about that right now. I just wanna say good-bye to my Grandma.
None the less.
I'm sorry, did you say all man or old man?
Oh yeah. You know, I don't know if I was happier when um George Bailey destroyed the family business or um, Donna Reid cried, or when the mean pharmacist made his ear bleed.
Well just figure out a way to talk him out of it.
Thanks.
Good!
Which one do you have?
Really? From who?
That was supposed to be a good thing, I forget why. Just listen, Monica, I, do you know, okay, do you know, I couldn't sleep for like a month because I got like a dot of ink on one of the sofa cushions.
No-no, we do it every year!
Okay, I think we have a problem here.
Yes, and now he's using this three divorces reason because he wants to stay married to her because he loves her. I must say, "Well done!" Bravo Meg.
I just thought we might be here for awhile. You know, things might get musical.
That's what you think.
Really?! Really?!
Morly Safer.
I don't know, it's just, you know...monkeys, Darwin, you know, it's a, it's a nice story, I just think it's a little too easy.
It's me. It's Phoebe. Listen there's something in here I want to eat, what-what smells so good?
Oh my God!-Eh! Well...
Oh my god.
There you go. Okay, do you think you're gonna be okay?
Oh God, here we go. For the first time in my life I'm gonna say 'Hi birthfather'.
YE-AH!
Okay bye.
That is so sweet, you guys.
Uh-huh. Good luck.
Oh, this is so nice. Alright I have to make a speech. I just wanna say that of all the guys that Monica has been with, and that is a lot, I like you the best.
Oh-okay, I get the game now.
Or, we could not tell them we know and have a little fun of our own.
Okay, well... guys?
OK. Um, how come I'm walking with you?
My God, Joey!
Hi Geller-Bing residence. How can I help?
What were you thinking?
So, what happens to the old guys?
I'D Better Go. Just Over Here I don't want to miss the fight.
You guys! You guys! You don't have to fight over her anymore. Whoever doesn't get Gladys gets Glynnis.
I sang. Hah!
No! Oh! You're alive! You're alive!
Oh, I'm still mad at them but I also now that they bring happiness to lots of kids who's moms didn't kill themselves, so by supporting them, I'm doing a good thing, but I'm not happy about it. So there, a selfless good deed.
Uh, well I can tell you why. It's, it's because of me. But, y'know what, I only did it because I love you. Okay?
She untied his G-string with her teeth. Somebody stop me!
But are you saying that you would move out if I didn't buy that lamp?
Yes. Once. Yeah, a little. He kinda did it to himself. It's not really a good story.
It worked!
I don't....
