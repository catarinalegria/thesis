Are you for Hanukkah, too? Because I'm part-Jewish.

Oh my God. This plane doesn't even have a Philange!
Look, either you leave, or we remove you.
Name?
Where are we?
You wanted to see me?
Maybe because you've got the keys?
Oh no-no, never say that. If we can't get it out then we can cut around the stain, add a little lace, you make a stylish throw.

Do I have a minute to go to the bathroom?
I really don't think he does. And y'know what? Maybe you guys could help clue him in. Y'know, tell him I'm-I'm not interested in a serious relationship or something.
Gavin, Ralph loved your ideas.
Yeah. I mean y'know, we haven't been going out that long. Come on, we haven't even slept together yet. Huh.
Hmm Phoebe, were you ever in a sorority?
They are delicious.
Well, you don't have that much time to relax. The other one will be along in a minute.
You're telling me this couch was delivered to you like this?!
Oh! What about, what about the girls?
Another Minute Maid fiasco.
