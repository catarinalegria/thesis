Okay, umm, if a kid gets straight A's, his parents would say, "Yeah, he pulled a Monica." Y'know? Or a fireman saves a baby, and they go, "Yeah I know, he pulled a Monica." Or someone hits a homerun and the announcer says, "Yeah, that one's outta here." Though some things don't change.
Holy crap!
Hey.
So, did you pick one yet?
Hey.
Yeah, you're right. This is none of our business.
Yes, but I wanted you to want to live with me, but okay, if you're having so much fun over here...
Uh-hmm. Okay. Well then, could we reschedule? For say, Friday night perhaps at 8 o'clock?
How do you know about this?
With the web, the spider she dies, she does. She has babies and dies. It's like ya know, hey welcome home from the hospital, thud.
Ooh, ok, that's it. Enough with the keys. No one say keys.
Joey, it's Estelle.
OK. Ooh, OK, you gotta give me a second, I wanna get this just right. Dude, 11 o'clock, totally hot babe checkin' you out. That was really good, I think I'm ready for my penis now.
Oh, I hear divorce bells.
Why are you looking at me like that?
What about Glen? He could be a Glen.
Oh, yeah! Back then y'know, we called the Great War. It really was!
Oh.
