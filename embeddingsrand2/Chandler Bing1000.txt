Oh, well...
Look I know it was a stupid reason to break up with somebody, but I was 15!
Alright, somebody kiss me. Somebody kiss me, it's midnight! Somebody kiss me!
Really?!
Excuse me?
You couldn't have at least changed your shirt.
Hey.
Hey, there he is! There he is!
I would never lie to get someone into bed.
I KNEW IT!!!!
God why why would you want to do that to yourself!?
Yes, and we'd appreciate it if no one told him yet.
Okay. Uh, we'll dim the lights, dim the lights. Or turn them out all together. Uh, no scented candles. Okay here. Here we go.
Did you not hear me say, "Du-ude?!"
You don't trust him?
See my friend-my friend, Rachel, she wants to be set up.
Well, like father, like son.
I turned it off. Mother of God, I turned it off!
Well, as long as the pilgrims didn't eat it, I'm in.
Right. Right. Well ah, y'know we could flip for it.
Hey, does anybody need anything copied? I'm going down to the Xerox place.
Uhhuh, how did you know that?
Excuse me, look, we've been here for over an hour, and a lot of people less sick than my friend have gone in. I mean, that guy with the toe thing? Who's he sleeping with? Oh, c'mon Dora, don't be mad... I know we both said some things we didn't mean, but that doesn't mean we still don't love each other. Y'know, I feel like I've lost her.. Ba-!
No-no-no-no-no!
You're turning into a women.
This sounds like a hernia. You have to-you-you go to the doctor!
Hey, Kicky. What're you doing?
Hey!
Okay great.
What?!
No, because you're not a grandmother!
Remember that really cold morning, you woke up and those dogs were licking your face?
There you go! Someone came!
Mustached bastard...
I know. You're right. I want to see you too. I've just got to figure out a way to tell Joey, you know? He's really looking forward to this.
Now I know it's been awhile, but I took it as a good sign.
And is this in case the house sneezes?
Okay. I just wanted them to hear it from somebody else.
He thought you said gonad.
Now wait a minute, I claimed you in the name of France four years ago.
I don't know, y'know. What, what, would you do?
Two hours, that lasted!
Yeah, well, I guess you don't need my help Victor Victoria!
We've got to do something!
Uh, four, a boy, twin girls and another boy.
Ha!
Oh, well, ah... maybe thats because theyre ah... jealous, of us.
You're Jewish.
I just feel awful.
I know it would make me happy, ma'am.
How do you feel about that?
Oh no-no-no, you-yeah, of course you get to be my best man.
Can you ever feel your ears?
Oh, I don't know.
Well... we-we do. You can only eat Tic Tacks in even numbers.
Well, what did the police say?
One more score to go! You can do it!
I'm sorry. When you were in high school you made out with a 50-year-old woman?
Dude, you're shaking!
No sir.
Joey!
At what point did it stop being funny that I took her passport? OPENING SEQUENCE.
See, you think it's just a pen, but then you turn it over and it's also a clock.
Oh!
That's why our honeymoon photos look like me and Diana Ross!
Yuh-huh.
You told him to play the boxer gay!!
Oh, that's fine! Go with your instincts, go with your instincts.
25J and K, any chance those aren't together?
Have you figured out what started the fire Mr. Fireman?
Well, we're talking about sperm donors and Zack may be the guy! I mean, look, he's intelligent, he's healthy, he's athletic, I mean, he is "spermtastic"!
What?! Why did you do that?
Ooooohh!
Why must everybody watch me sleep? There'll be no more watching me sleep, no more watching.
Here just...take this.
Hey, come on, it's not your fault.
No!
Okay! That's a four! And where-where's the other one?
Oh, well... Maybe I'll join them some time. I just hope the club doesn't slip out of my hand and beat the moustache off his face.
I don't know.
Well, so why not go knock?
Hey, how 'bout it? You, me, Saturday night?
Yes, but I feel like I've really gotten in touch with my feminine side enough today. You know. In fact I think we're two sachets away from becoming a lesbian couple.
Game's tomorrow night Joe.
Stunning entertainment center. Fine, fine Italian craftsmanship.
Oh, what the hell is that?
Rachel... with handcuffs! Interesting!
Guys are signing over their 401-K's to me?
All right, look, you're not really gonna buy that are you? Don't you think you've embarrassed me enough for one day?
Thanks!
Should I use my invisibility to fight crime or for evil?
Wow, it seems serious. What seems to be the problem, Ashley Judd?
Kill me. Kill me now.
Okay, it's just that dogs make me a little uncomfortable.
Hey look, are we gonna have to bring this out every time Ross comes over?
David, I'm pretending to read here!!
Oh yeah. First off all, chasing the Churo guy isn't jogging.
Yeah...!?
Hey!
No. How are ya Paul?
Yes, we don't get married unless there's a sign! Okay, so say uh, say you roll another eight then there's a definite sign that we should get married.
Hey man, look it's my best bud. How ya doin? Wow, you are really gettin' good at that Marcel Marceau thing. Hey, whaddya say uh, we play some ball, you and me, huh, whaddya say? OK, that's my bad.
They left.
No, no, no.
....And then I just, you know, threw the bag of barley at her, and ran out of the store.
Althea?! What are you doing?!
Yeah, let's celebrate life!
Oooh-hoo, very attractive, forgiving.
Okaaay, rock, hard place, me.
She's right, you shouldn't have bought tickets just for us ...
Is this because of the burrito thing?
Varrrrrroom! Hey! Watch it lady! Varrrrrrrrrrom! Hey-hey good lookin'! Varrrrrrrrroom. All right, I'll leave. My bed's so boring.
Maybe not even then.
Not quite. Monica's still at the salon, and I'm just finishing packing.
Did I go to this school?
Wait! You're going out with Kathy!
Well I've forgotten what it tastes like okay?!
Oh yeah, me too. Y'know if this shirt is dirty. Yep.
What? What? Why?!
Jeez, man did you fall.. Hi! So ah, did ya, did-did-did ya fall high?
Here, pass these, will ya..
See? Intuitive!
This is exactly the kind of social situation that I am not comfortable with!
You got it. You got Nevada twice.
Y'know uh, I didn't actually do this.
Ross-Joey, Joey-Ross.
It's not charity, Joe...
Football? Just football?
Now this feels like Thanksgiving.
All right!
Oh! That's great, they haven't seen the place since I moved in!
...And what did you bring?
Oh that's not true! That's not true! I got her that backpack and she loved it! I remember how much she was crying the day when that big dog ran off with it... Oh, there was no big dog. All right this sucks! I already got her this briefcase, and I had R.G. put on it... Her initials...
I don't like your massages.
What?
Fancy guest.
Y'know, I saw a wine cellar downstairs...
I get pedicures!
That was... Impressive.
Yes!!!
Oh come on!
No! No! No! No--one can beat me.
All right. I'll tell you what. When we're 40, if neither one of us are married, what do you say you and I get together and have one?
Okay, I went over to Ross' apartment to bring back Clunkers. Y'know, for you, and... I left the door open and she must have gotten out and I looked everywhere, all over the apartment, including the roof, which FYI Ross, one of your neighbors, growing weed. I couldn't find him, and I am so, so, so, sorry. But I do know where we could all go ease the pain.
And, ah, you know, your fooling around with her. And you get all these like, mental images in your brain, you know, like Elle MacPherson, or that girl at the Xerox place....
You know what's not funny? Male Pattern Baldness.
There's no back to this couch!
No.
Was it like a sneeze only better?
Wow!
How did the job stuff go?
Have you talked to him lately?
Hi.... um... okay, next word... would be... Chandler! Chandler is my name, and, uh... ...hi.
Listen Phoebe, he's right. People are not supposed to have heart attacks at 31.
Whoa-whoa-whoa! We're having kids?!
He said...he said, he said that they're having a great time. I'm sorry. But, the silver lining, if you wanna see it, is that he made the decision all by himself! Without any outside help whatsoever.
All right look, forget it, forget it. You told her you love her, it's over.
Did you make it, or are you just serving it?
Because he's crazy. Okay? He came up to me earlier and thanked me for my very moving performance in Titanic.
Listen ah, Joe, I-I need to, I need to talk to you about something.
The comedian? USO?!
We still got it!
No, no! We made this decision together.
Come in!
Sorry.
Why are you so sure I didn't watch this tape?
Picturing that tree?
I know, it's beautiful. Amazing.
You'll get one.
And I just want a million dollars!
Yeah, get out!
Forty-five minutes? We have tickets to the Musicman at 8:00.
It's a tradition, like the parade. If the parade decided it was gay, moved out, and abandoned its entire family.
Y'know that is a popular opinion today I must say.
Coffee house?
What???
Bye.
Oh no, yes we do my man. Remember when we were back in college and we went to that spring dance and you walked right up to that girl you liked and you could not stop talking about the Irish potato famine?
Yeah?
Knock-knock. Who's there? Ross Geller's lunch. Ross Geller's lunch, who? Ross Geller's lunch, please don't take me. Okay?
Okay, a little announcement, a little announcement. I've decided that my best man is, my best friend Gunther!
You mind if I...
I personally could have a gallon of Alan.
Yeah.
Let me ask you, why is everybody using these tiny lights nowadays? I remember when people used to use big lights.
Yeah, well sure, when he did it, it was funny. When I did it to my boss's hat. . . all of the sudden I have this big attitude problem.
Well, uh, Dr. Greene, where are you going?
The doctor.
Yeah I just... wanted to call and say hey.
Yeah, I thought so to until I paper mached one of my eyes shut.
I'm going crazy! Okay? Do you have any thing around here that looks homemade?
That's what you should say.
You know what, okay, fine. Don't get up, you just sit right there. I just hope, you don't mind, you know, my hand right here. Op, not touching, can't get mad! Not touching can't get mad! Not touching can't get mad!
We're trying to get pregnant. Y'know I'm not really comfortable doing this in front of the babies. So, when do you want to start trying?
I think so. Yeah, get off me.
Thanks
Well I was... I was exactly expecting company after... 9:15.
'Candy and Cookie'. 'Candy and Cookie?' Monica got me porn?! Girl-on-girl porn?! She really must love me!!
I wanna quit the bank!
Yeah o-okay, but I'm just doing this for you.
Oh no, it's gonna be named after some snack or baked good isn't it?
All right, maybe I should call her.
Really.
Oh my God!
What is the matter with you?
I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name. Paul, was it?
Yes, Fran. I know what time it is, but I'm looking at the WENUS and I'm not happy!
So you came to the room looking for Joey? Did you ever in-intend on telling me about this?
Joe?
Kinda... you know, sneaking around, having to hide from you guys...
Well, does that mean that you're not going to wearing yours?
We don't, really.
Joe, I told you, you're just not right for the part.
Hey, what are you doing here? Shouldn't you be at work?
I'm sure that would mean a lot to him. And if heaven has a door, I'm sure he's pressing his ear up against it and listening intently.
Well, no, although I did have an imaginary friend, who... my parents actually preferred.
So uh, what's this thing you're auditioning for?
...I think you'll find if I come to work here, I don't micro-manage. I don't shy away from delegating.
Maybe, isn't she the woman who lives below you and has sex really loud?
I know what you meant!! You notice that ever since we got this chick, we've been fighting a lot more than we used too?
...and a street where our kids can ride their bikes and maybe an ice-cream truck can go by.
Yeah, let's just forget it.
Oh, yeah! RACHEL TALKS TOO!
Three!
I think they get it.
Joe...
I didn't realize that.
You don't say anything.
No!
Well, this does butch it up a bit.
Okay, I'll stop.
No, it's like all of the sudden, we were this couple. And this alarm started going off in my head 'Run for your life! Get out of the building!'
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, you're right. Come on, do it, do it, go, come on!!!
No.
Myyy mother, ladies and gentlemen.
Well, it's not your fault. What are you gonna do? Not take her to the hospital? Y'know? You're doing nothing wrong. Except for harboring an all consuming love for the woman whose carrying his baby. Richard? If-if you're in there, could you pass me my credit card?
No. No, I just think that maybe I-I'd heard it somewhere before.
Okay.
Nooo.
I'm out of words. Should I just say the whole thing again?
Hey.
Well, why don't you send her a musical bug, op, no you already did that. All right look, you're going to have to go there yourself now, okay, make a few surprise visits.
You ah, you have, you have to leave, now? How come?
That-that's bad?
David is going to propose to Phoebe.
Yeah, y'know what I got a better idea. How-how 'bout it blocks none of mine door and a lot of yours?
Yes, but this is Pete. Okay? He's not like other people, on your first date he took you to Rome. For most guys that's like a third or fourth date kinda thing.
No, you should.
You guys wanna eat here?
You mean with Casey.
You don't like that show?
All right!
Come on, he won't even know what they mean.
I'll go.
All right.
You got your passport?
Hey.
We have heard you play.
It's a hand. It's a thing you use as a Jack and Coke holder.
All right!! Wait! Wait, there's no sidewalk! Yeah, I'm gonna die here.
Don't look honey. Change the channel! Change the channel!
That's what I was doing too.
Y'know I think you can take her.
What about him?
That's what you say at the end of a date.
You mean there's more than one of us.
Hi.
Hey.
Okay, one thing at a time.
Hey!
Do you have any beers? We're out of beers.
OK.
Yep! And! A beautiful woman agreed to go out with me. Joey wanted to ask her out, but uh, she picked me.
Interesting, cause in my dreams, I'm allways surprisingly inadequate.
Okay, you know, you know when your in bed, with a woman.
Oh yeah! He has a caretaker. His older brother... Ernie.
What did you do?
OK, so at this point, the dealer...
Oh, you're-you're going?
Well, I'm not really in a sexy mood right now.
Ugh. Just a sec, give me a minute to wake up for this-Ah-ha-ha!! You lost the ring! You're the worst best man ever!
Oh! Oh! That's so hard.
And this has nothing to do with the fact that he needs a note to get out of gym.
Look, maybe I got carried away before. But there's something you gotta know. If I'm the best, it's only because you've made me the best.
Yeah, I can be a hero, I could do that. I could, I could do... I, w-w-what if, what if it attacks me?
Me too.
Oh, those places! There's always so many people, their being corralled like cattle, and... you know, there's always some idiot who goes "Mooooo"!
Oh all right.
Ha-ha-ha--enh-enh. I'm so glad you guys are all here! My office finally got wrinkle free fax paper!
Hi.
Yeah I know, but I figured a shot y'know? Maybe one of those stories would make me cry and then you wouldn't think I was y'know, all dead inside.
Isn't that Ross's money?
Okay, she is the star of the play. And she is my girlfriend! I get to have sex with the star of the play!
This is ridiculous.
You okay?
Ehh, you're just liquored up.
Oh yeah, and what would my opening line be? 'Excuse me. Blarrglarrghh.'
Yep, I'm in a tree.
Don't play with his things.
Whoa-ho, back off, Missy!
That's the stuff!
Well, I don't have to break up with her this time. We're not involved! I'm going to do a pre-emptive strike! I'm going to end it with her before it starts. My ass is like frozen!
Yeah, we're gonna need to see that tape.
I made that joke up.
Well, that's what we said about Joey...
Hey, this isn't like swimming after you eat, pick up the phone!!
Well it's very unsettling.
Oh my God! If you say that one more time, I'm gonna break up with you!
Okay Bob listen uhh, I'm the reason you didn't get the job up here.
Really?! I-I thought you weren't looking for something serious? I thought you were looking for some kind of a fling.
And I'm cute too.
What about that circled one?
We're notwe're not saying anything.
What did you do when they found out?
Calm down? Calm down? You set me up with the woman that I've dumped twice in the last five months!
Hey!
I'm going to the bathroom now.
Here.
Ross came in forth and cried!
Yes.
Run! Run you crazy, rich freak!
Who's the father?
Okay.
Do you know what I was thinkin'?
I got glasses!
Because it's Sunday. It's God's day.
Okay, a quick one. Come on hug it out. Oh hey! There you go. Okay.
Then I got all needy and clingy.
Thanks.
Batman has a utility belt!
Oh really?! You think you're stronger? Why don't you prove it?
Because weddings are a great place to meet women, and when I dance, I look like this...
Oh good, when he comes back for his keys, I'll be sure to give him your shoe.
She? It's a girl?
Go change! She doesn't want her parents to know she's drunk.
To my best bud. Thanks best bud.
Because uh...we-we...we split up. Monica and I split up. Hold me.
I have you.
everything's great, just watching some regular television there, what a pleasant surprise.
Yeah, for about 30 minutes.
You didn't like that?
Thanks. What, let me have her?! What do mean? Like if you didn't I wouldn't have a shot?
Yeah I even got a ring. Did you get a ring?
Oh my God.
Good luck, man. I hope you get it.
And we're done with the chicken fried rice.
Oh that's great, my friend Joey's in the movie business.
Hey Joe!
Sweet mother of all that is good and pure.
Joe...
It bodes well for me that speed impresses you.
How is that me?
I'm fine.
That's the perfect amount!
What?
Well, I can't believe I've been here almost seven seconds and you haven't asked me how my date went.
Yeah, and I-I gave first names to all of the foosball players.
Neat. I'm gonna die alone.
We are supposed to make these decisions together! Did you not watch the Doctor Phil I taped for you?
Forget it, that's off.
So whaddya got there Monica?
See that is the problem with invisible dentists.
Noo!! You don't have a boyfriend because....I don't, I don't know why you don't have a boyfriend. You should have a boyfriend.
They don't really talk to us about that kind of stuff. I can get you some free white out though.
I paid for those tickets!
Or what my Father called Thursday night.
Look, I'm sorry I didn't give them your tape. And I promise, next time to submit you whether I think you are right for the part or not.
Okay, how'd it go at the doctor's?
Well, I have kissed over four women. Do you wanna get under the covers?
I'll...I'll get you later!
Why?
Well, Ross and Emily aren't gonna use it.
That's the way I did it 'til I was 19.
Hey, look, I know what it is to be a friend, I just-I just screwed up!
Heckles played clarinet in band, and I played clarinet. And he was in the scale modeler's club, and I was, well, there was no club, but I sure thought they were cool.
Wait a minute, is she going for spring vacation or is she going for spring break?
Wh-wh-why?!
Well, I think it all started when you said, "Hey Joey, why don't you be my best man."
That's great. All right, I gotta get to work, I got a big dinosaur bone to inspect.
Ah, you obviously saw my personal ad.
Looking for restaurant jobs for you in Tulsa.
Good luck.
The meaning of the box is three fold. One , it gives me the time to think about what I did. Two , it proves how much I care about my friendship with Joey. And three , it hurts!
Well, close to...
Hey, he's not crying.
It's gonna be ok. You know that?
Yeah I know.
He really is a chameleon.
What time is it now?
Yeah, all right.
Sure, I'll do it with ya.
How do you not fall down more?
Yeah.
Does anybody know me?!
Well, I'm upset-for you. I mean, having sex with an endless line of beautiful women must be very unfulfilling for you.
All right! I'm putting it out, I'm putting it out.
Okay, great.
So where are you applying to?
Yes, of course.
You too.
Buy stamps, pick up dry cleaning...Don't let Phoebe in.
What are you doing tonight?
Yeah! It's a stupid job, and I could not stand leaving you. And why should I be the only one who doesn't get to do what he *really* wants to do?
What is it?
Where have you been?
Hey!
Okay now it doesn't matter which one you choose, y'know? It's completely up to you. Our guy is perfect, or you can go out with the guy Phoebe deemed not good enough to go out with herself.
Okay.
And basically, that's how a bill becomes a law.
Well, look it's been a really emotional time y'know, and you've had a lot to drink. And you've just got to let that go okay? I mean you were the most beautiful in the room tonight!
Ahh, Gepeto, $5,000 dollars? Are you insane?
So what do you think? I want that guys genes for my kid! Those eyes, those cheeckbones!
Okay, let's play my game now.
No. No I'm just tired. Y'know, from-from the walk.
Look at her go! She must love me more than I love her! What's wrong with me? Ooh, don't open that door.
See, honey, there's-
Really? Then what are they doing in our guestroom?
Nice!
Mmmm. Not tonight, honey. I got an early day tomorrow.
This is not going to work.
I'm not saying it was a good idea, I'm saying I snapped!
oh it was great.
Y'know what, he's right. There's something like uh, ammonia in that, that like kills the pain.
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah! Me too!
Phoebe!
Well, I don't see that we have a choice. But, when we're back home, we don't do it.
You guys ready fore the movies?
Yeah! If-if-if we did do this there would be a lot of pressure on me, y'know? Because you've been waiting a very long time and I wouldn't want to disappoint you.
Me too...
Hey, Rach, can I get...
Yes, Bravo on the hot nanny.
Hey Ross, I was wondering if... Oh my God!! Where are all the men???
Hey, mister tux!
Well, Monica and Chandler can't go. We're going to dinner remember?!
Can you hear that?
Well, y'know I'm 29. I mean who needs a savings account.
You have gotta stop!
Are you aware that you're still talking?
Monica can I talk to you outside for a minute?
Do not speak ill of the dead.
I invented the game of Cups as a way to give Joey money.
Oooooooh! Meddler! Meddler!
Wow! You are way to young to have seen that!
Well, I think it's great that you're going on a date, you know? I mean, it sounds healthy. I mean, you have needs. Embrace your womanhood!
Honey, we've been over this. I need to be facing the other way.
Listen, I just wanted to apologize about this afternoon and the whole massage thing. Y'know? I-I really like 'em.
Hello? Hello?
Oh my... God?
Don't let yourself get manipulated this way!
Did somebody sign your bra?
It was a "Wendy's!! "
...so then the farmer says, "That's not a cow and you're not milking it."
Yes.
God! She is not stealing from us! Okay, will you let this go?
Well, y'know, you and me, it had to end sometime.
Really?
For my last birthday you gave me a hug! Okay, read the card! Read the card!
Okay.
Any chance you are trying to pick a fight to make all this easier?
When we were?
What? What?
Huh.
Thanks.
Sorry, you had a paleontologist on your face. But, uh, it's gone now, you're alright.
Oh, y'know, what did you mean when you said pivot?
Yeah, I mean, there's probably gonna be some ground work which will probably stink, you know, grown man getting people coffee is a little humiliating.
Well ah, ........y'know.
Yeah, I'm gonna pass. 'Cause I was kinda iffy when it was puppies.
Fine!
He's not supposed to ask my girlfriend to marry him! I'm supposed to do that!
Ho-ho, you win! 50 dollars!
Pulling flowers out it makes the bag look a lot more masculine.
Theyre twins!
Well, I have kissed over four women. Do you wanna get under the covers?
Ross.
Honey, it's gonna be okay.
Okay.
Y'know, I-I can't really put a price on that Joe.
You know what I just realized? We have no idea what we're doing in the wedding tomorrow.
Well, so, play for the next 30 minutes and then write until he gets home.
Y'know what, I can handle it, handle's my middle name. Actually it's the ah, middle part of my first name.
Now that's so funny, because last Christmas I got the gift of space. We should get them together and make a continuum.
Why are you napping over here instead of over at your place?
Hey! Wow, it is true what they say, pregnant bellies look like a drum.
Ah, look on the bright side, I mean you won't have to live with this ugly chair! That was here already huh? I love you.
Well, let me see... I-I believe I'm... yes, falling asleep in front of the TV.
You look beautiful. Is this new?
So what'd you do?
Okay, we have to talk. I'm just getting out of a very serious relationship...
Are we in London?
Janice! There you are! There you are! I had to have one last kiss, and also-also you said that you were going to leave right after I got on the plane!
Yes, it's also 2003.
Ooh! Calm down ...
No, we'd just like to close them.
No. And if I did, I don't think we'd be going out. Monica, this is getting ridiculous!
It's a kitchen slash bathroom.
Dude, it's Chandler. Let me in.
Ok, I don't care what you guys say, something's bothering her.
O-okay. So, is she gonna take the test?
Hey, by any chance did either of pick uh Rachel for your secret Santa, 'cause I wanna trade for her.
And condoms are the way to do that?
Nope, nope, I'd just ah, I'd rather talk to you. Yes, I do. Yes, I do have to go to the bathroom.
Now I've upset you? What did I say?
Well hello!
Okay, what is in here? Rocks?
Y'know I was thinking if we had a...a big fight and uh we broke up for a few hours...
There's nobody here Joe.
I figured I'd buy those. Pat, I'd like to buy a vow.
Again?
Weird world. Your kids?
Hey, you know who used to have nails like that?
Wow! You look amazing!
Y'know what Gunther, go ah, go ahead, I'm-I'm talking to ah, . This is the part where you say your name.
You know, I don't mean to brag, but I waited tables at Innsbruck in '76. Amouz-bouche?
It was terrible. I fought with my colleagues y'know, the entire time. Are you kidding with this?
Because it's a relaxing and enjoyable time!
What?
Yeah, just think of it as $25 per room!
You bitch.
Well, I'm here to see my old buddy Ben. What are you doing here, weird...turtle-man?
Really? In front of all this people?
Well I just, thought maybe you'd wanna book some time with the best you'd ever had.
I know..
We're just here to say goodbye, we're off to Ohio.
So you understand, I'd feel a lot more comfortable if you didn't tell people what happened. Y'know, I'm a little...I'm a little embarrassed about it.
Well! We er..climbed up four flights of stairs, manueveored a narrow hallway, dodged a rabid pitbul... but these last three feet are where it gets really tricky.
Honey I... I love your breasts the way they are!
Wow umm, calm down.
Ahh yes, the messers become the messies!
Turns out he is kinda funny.
Ohh, yeah.
All right.
All right!
I just came over to drop off...nothing. So that weekend kinda sucked, huh?
Look, Monica has been working hard all day, she didn't wanna host this thing in the first place, we shouldn't go!
Did he just say, he loves Fonzie?
Really? You got us a chick and a duck?
Y'know, I don't see that happening?
Well what did it do?
You wanna see if we still have it?
You don't think I've tried? You think I like having 50 dollars taken out of my bank account every month? No, they make you go all the way down there! Then they use all of these phrases and peppiness to try and confuse you! Then they bring out Maria.
Hey! Did you find the cameras?
Well, Joey, I wrote a little song today. It's called Get Up.
Y'know I'm-I'm really glad we decided not to sleep together before the wedding.
Joe, I don't think this is going to be your big break.
Dehydrated Japanese noodles under fluorescent lights... does it get better than this?
Right.
You didn't get more movies that are gonna have us reaching for the tissues all night did you?
I am so much older than these other interns. I can't compete with them.
Yeah me too.
Yes I did, and I think you should do it.
Y'know what? I don't trust you with this cake anymore! And I got it first, and I'm takin' it back!
This is the worst bachelor party ever!
Congratulations.
If I'm gonna be an old, lonely man, I'm gonna need a thing, you know, a hook, like that guy on the subway who eats his own face. So I figure I'll be Crazy Man with a Snake, yknow. Crazy Snake Man. And I'll get more snakes, call them my babies, kids will walk past my place, they will run. "Run away from Crazy Snake Man," they'll shout!
Nice work my friend.
No you know I don't mind.
Y'know, it wasn't that big a deal. He just balled up socks... and a melon...
We really...didn't get a chance to...
Good luck.
Hey!
Ooh, I do! I do! I do!
Y'know, whipped! Wah-pah!
You're it! Now run and hide!
Mhum.
Okay. You opened all the presents without me?! I thought we were supposed to do that together!
Oh good. Good, because I'm sure this interview is gonna last a couple of weeks.
I can tell from your expressions that that's the good news you were hoping for... Well, I'm gonna go continue to... spread the joy.
Oh no-no-no I was just squinting. That doesn't mean anything.
It is not okay that I'm aroused by this now.
All right, we haven't had sex yet. Okay, what's the big deal? Y'know? This is special, and I want our love to grow until we move on to the next level.
No. Is there anyway, anyway you think he'll understand this?
You mean like this?
Veronica. Look, it's got to be Veronica, the girl in the red skirt. I definitely stuck my tongue down her throat.
Oh no, it's terrific, it's... it's... y'know, you deserve this, after all your years of struggling, you've finally been able to crack your way into showbusiness.
Our adoption social worker is coming by today so we are cleaning the apartment.
Ohh, she's pretty. Pretty ahh, pretty girl, the pretty--she's pretty.
Why don't you use ours across the hall, 'cause she...has...problems.
Hey.
Yes, and his father invented that magnetic strip on the back of credit cards.
Now, there is a dress laid out on your bed. Okay, you're doing great. You're doing great. You're doing fine.
I couldn't say that I was naked because she's allowed too see me naked.
My wife and I have some boundary issues, you know, sometimes we ask inappropriate questions. We're working on it.
Y'know you, really didn't have to take me to the airport.
Whoa-ho, whoa! No, I was thinking about y'know for me, as a part of that whole getting over Janice thing you were talking about.
Crazy bitch.
Count of three?
That old woman was being scammed by her mechanic.
I'm afraid I can't let you do that, Joe.
Oh no-no-no!
When it comes down to it, you would risk your life for Ross before you would for me. That's the bottom line.
Oh, how well you know me...
Of course I'm awake. Assume from now on that I'm always awake!
Dangerous Liaisons.
What picture?
I'd like a Google Card.
But I didn't get to shake my belly like a bowl full of jelly.
I Understand who would cancel an actual date to go to a fake bachelor party?
Yeah?
Wax the door shut, we're never leaving, ever.
I love you.
Okay, I promise, I'll end it.
Well, let's just say the impressions you made in the butter left little to the imagination.
The key's stuck in the lock.
Yes.
Really? Struck down in the pribe of libe!
And Milton Berle has a...
Would you tell her I let you win please?
Uh, yes, yes it is.
I don't wanna know what Monica got me. Y'know? I mean, look, I'm sure she worked really hard at getting you a present, and wanting to surprise me, and you guys are gonna ruin that, and I, look we have to put these back, this is not what Christmas is about.
Hey honey!
Oh, he's in the back. The duck pissed him off, said that eggs came first.
Ohhh. Don't go.
I suppose that Monica will have the ... manipulative shrew.
Hey, no, I've never been lower or wetter. I'll be fine. I'll just turn your, uh, bedroom into a game room or somethin', you know, put the foosball table in there.
Forget what I said, I was babbling! Pick me!
C'mon, there's nothin' to see, it's just a tiny bump, it's totally useless.
All right, fine, you know what, we'll both sit in the chair. I'm soooo, comfortable.
Who's he huggin'?
What, no, "Nice apartment, I bet the bedrooms are huge?"
NO! No, I'll take that for ya.
Hey.
OK well here, we'll just move the coffee table closer to the couch.
Well you see in Cups, once you get $700, you have to double it.
So do you think uh, Joey's more charming than me?
That's OK.
Umm ma'am, do you have a minute? I kind of have some bad news. I don't think I can move to Tulsa.
Oh, it's just some crazy guy who roams the halls here. He's great with kids though.
Not the disposable cameras from the tables.
M-Me-me-me!
I have my reasons.
Plus I thought the baby would be in good hands with a doctor!
Ok, think, what would Jack and Chrissy do?
Hey, can I talk to you about this groomsman thing? If you pick Ross, he'll walk you down the isle just fine. But if you choose me, you'll be getting some comedy!
No! We're not borrowing money.
Well, I guess thats why they call it psychology, sir.
How long have we been home?
Is everybody else seeing a troll doll nailed to a two by four?
Hey!
Tuna or egg salad? Decide!
Well, if it helps there were only three. So it would just be for tonight, right?
Oh no..don't thank me. Thank you. You know there's not one thing I would change about you? Not one single thing! And definitely not... two... single things.
Ok, ok, you can be shirts and I'll be skins. I'll be skins. Hey, how you holdin' up there, tiger? Oh, sorry, when my parents were getting divorced I got a lot of tigers. Got a lot of champs, chiefs, sports, I even got a governor.
Yeah, and there's a bowl of cranberry sauce that... what happens to cranberry sauce?
No I didn't!
Okay.
I'm not your garbage man. I'm your mailman.
All right, so that's Missy Goldberg, Phoebe Cates and Molly Ringwald, who neither of us can go out with.
I was in the car with Nancy all day.
Hey.
Here!
Hey.
No.
You have no trouble telling time now right?
Well maybe he was nervous.
Hi! How'd it go?
Yes. When Monica and I were in London, we were both in London.
Well, there you are! So what did Elizabeth say?
Oh, listen. If this is about those prank memos, I had nothing to do with them. Really. Nothing at all. Really. Nothing.
I can't believe you did this.
Okay.
We talked 'til like two. It was this perfect evening... more or less.
Oooh! I hope you're happy too, honey!
Ooh, Lambchop. How old is that sock? If I had a sock on my hand for thirty years it'd be talking too.
See? Here we go.
Fun's over!
No I didn't!
Do you have my credit card?
It's the Miracle Wax.
Oh, come on! It's not like this is an everyday occurrence for me! I mean usually I'm pretty much just in there by myself.
Hey man, how did the audition go?
So how come Richard's selling the place? Went bankrupt? Medical malpractice? Choked on his own moustache?
I couldn't find anything at Joey--Hey-hey, oh hey!
Eddie, I didn't sleep with your ex-girlfriend.
Hey!!!
Oh. Y'know, that night meant a lot to me too, and it wasn't because I was in a bad place or anything, it just meant a lot to me 'cause, you're really hot! Is that okay?
Well, can I just...
Oh, that's The Wedding March. Does, does that freak you out?
Pretty well. Except for the stapler thing. Little tip: if youre ever in a similar situation, never ever leave your hand... ..on the desk.
Hey! You okay?
Cups.
Our baby.
Honey, I got us that room at the Woodford Inn this weekend.
Aren't you...?
Because soap is soap. It's self-cleaning.
What are you talking about?
Hey! What are you guys doing?
Art lover!
Excuse me, Doug? Hey there sports fan!!
Well, I like danger.
Well actually uh, there was something we wanted to tell you about the wedding. Um, it's going to be a small ceremony. Uh, tiny! We're not even sure why we're having it.
That was amazing.
Yeah.
Yes, 98.6. You're gonna be fine.
Why did you get me this?
Okay, well tonight's the big night.
Monica got ice in her eye, and it hurts.
Aren't you one of the stars of the popular daytime soap Days of Our Lives?
No not Candy Lady.
Well, we could count again.
Oh, right, right, shut up.
Ah, you're still just a little fat girl inside aren't you?
Hey Ross.... bahhhh!
You know that's not the reason Joe.
I am mad! But you know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna forgive you! Because that's what friends do! They forgive their friends when they do everything you just said, all on the list there. Well, but I want you to remember that I forgave you.
Yes, hitting her with a frying pan's a good idea. We might wanna have a backup plan, though, just in case she isn't a cartoon.
I know.
Okay. Okay.
NO!!!
Wow, it's, it's like porno for clowns.
Yeah, and I don't have any cologne.
Hey.
Yes, Janice. Why is that so difficult for you to comprehend?
I think it's the dying cat parade.
You do it!
Okay, how long is this going to go on.
No, no the gravel capades. Yeah, the turns aren't as fast but when Snoopy falls. . . funny.
How about Joey... Pepponi?
Who cares? It's a stupid game.
Wow! That ripped! That ripped real nice!
A freakish thin date with a hanger for her head?
Centerpieces!
Me, that guy who just said butt cracks?
Oh, no, no. Nina... ..she is whooo wewee-woo whoo whoo! In fact, if you asked her right now, she would have no recollection of being fired at all, none at all.
Okay, but there is a big difference. You are a lot hotter than I am.
That's great, but shouldn't you be on the toilet right now?
Well what's the difference? Your eggs aren't here anymore, are they? You took your eggs and you left. You really expect me to never find new eggs?
No, nono, don't- don't worry about it. Believe me, apparently other people have made the same mistake.
Oh my God, I can't believe this! Y'know, I thought...I thought you were a good guy.
FREE PORN!!!
All right, check out this bad boy. 12 megabytes of ram. 500 megabyte hard drive. Built-in spreadsheet capabilities and a modem that transmits at over 28,000 b.p.s.
That's the thing, see I would like to stay in the pribe of mwha-ah-libe.
Hey!
Are you kidding me?! Joey. Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey!!
We can't do that that's insane. I mean 'A' he could wake up and 'B' y'know, let's go for it.
Listen, this is totally getting out of hand! Okay? She wants me to put lotion on her!
Y'know, I was thinking about ah, asking her for her number.
Yeah. Well, I think our second fight is going to be a big one!
I'm pretty sure I put her on my bed.
Well, sure, but can you play it on a plane?
I don't know. It's a bracelet.
Ok!
You want some help.
This is so exciting! It's so glamorous! People taking our picture. How do I look?
It's Paris, who knows we're here!
It still wouldn't be clean. All I want is my freedom.
That's a hernia.
Oh, it wasn't a big deal. I just went to a couple of bookstores, talked to a couple of dealers... called a couple of the author's grandchildren.
Yes, but these women are very hot, and they need our help! And they're very hot.
That's where people make number two!!
Ohhh.
I'll tell you what, I will go get them developed and you can go home.
Maybe I could give thanks by taking my Playstation over to my new apartment.
Unfortunately that is correct.
Okay, I don't think we can turn anymore!
Woah, hey, yo.
Lets not do that any more.
What?!
Pull my finger--My hand is messed up.
No, I prefer to keep a safe distance from all this merriment.
What's wrong? What's wrong? You're married that's what's wrong.
Hi! Bye!
And yet, she's still not hanging up the phone.
All right, there's a nuclear holocaust, I'm the last man on Earth. Would you go out with me?
Look you have to help me out here. I thought we had a deal. I thought by the time...
...Quality, right, great.
Hey!
Look, you have done enough! Okay? You have to stop this now.
You know, Ross, some scientists are now saying that, that monkeys and babies are actually different.
And the fireplace in the bedroom.
Not so much!
Joey... Switzerland?
Well, whatever it is, I hope it involves winking.
Hey.
No, you kidding? The guy's a freak..
All right! Ten buck! Fork it over! Cough it up! Pay the piper! Gimme it.
Oh, thanks! I'm... actually thinking about becoming a motivational speaker.
Buddy?
Forget it! Okay, I'm not giving up the apartment.
Okay, but be careful okay, because I wanna get our security deposit back.
If I help, we can find 'em faster!
Yes, money well spent!
Well, if the magician can open my beer with his but cheeks, then all right.
Yes, he is!
Hey Phoebe!
Okay. Joey, trade lives with me!
Well, remember the first time we saw Jaws?
I can't seem to say goodbye.
All right, Pheebs, back me up here, ok? You believe in that karma crap, don't you?
Guys, guys, guess who I am?!
All right. Now go see Miss Kitty and she'll fix you up with a nice hooker.
Well, I'm sure you'll teach her a lesson when she steps off the dock onto nothing. Hey Mr. Douglas.
Uh-oh, it's my boss!
What?
I have no idea.
Oh hey!
So I really never get to win anymore?
Janice?
Definitely roses. Well, I just think they're a little more weddingy. But Lilies are the clear choice.
Totally. I had sex in High school...
Okay, so this time I won't quit!
Oh! Worm medicine for the duck.
Yep!
It's about cutting my people a little slack, ya know, for morale. Look, if you wanna see some rough numbers, I can get them to you by Wednesday.
Open up! Open up! Open up!
Phil.
I don't know.
Yeah, well, I don't dance at weddings.
Y'know what? I-I kinda have.
So, ahh, how are ya? How ya...How ya... You okay?
You know, it's funny when my parents got divorced, they sent me to this shrink, and she told me that all kids have a tendency to blame themselves. But in your case it's actually kinda true.
Do I look fat?
Friends!
Wow!! Can Joey and I put them on and fight?
So are we...friends again?
What are you doing here?
Okay.
What does it say?!
Ok, you're going to have to stop that, forever!
Because I'm in love with Monica!!
Emma? Emma? Look at me! Well, I think I'll go downstairs for a while.
Okay, I've been doing a lot of thinking about us, y'know a lot of uhh, us thinking. And uh, well I guess there's only one-one way to do this.
Well it wouldn't kill you to say it once in a while.
Hi, it's me.
Don't ask me, I was in there canoodling you!
Oh, y'know what, that might be okay even if it was just kind of a fling, that might be all right with Rachel.
I did. But it came at a price.
No, I mean it, this feels really good. Is it a hundred percent cotton?
OK, then, eat me, I'm done.
Chandler, Chandler Bing. I'm not gay, I'm not gay at all.
I was not staring at her. Okay? I was just listening intently. It's called being a good conversationalist. Watch. Say something.
That's a great idea! We can easily think of a way for us both to enjoy the room.
You're going down.
He didn't say anything about that to me.
Uhh yeah. Yeah, it's right, right down there. Right there, yeah. Can I ask you why?
If that is your father calling to tell this story then the marriage is off!
Rach, Rach, knock knock.
Oh, what's the matter?
Ha-ha-ha. A little to hard. What am I not ah, boyfriend material?
You done?
Her ass print is still on your grandmother's quilt, do you really want to talk about smoking?
Oh-oh, yeah, and did he also say that ah, some of the dialogue was corny and that he actually found it was funny and not sexy?
Oh come on you big faker!
You know, you think I would.
Sure...
Hey! Stop staring at my wife's legs! No no! Stop staring at your sister's legs!
Well seeing that drunk Santa wet himself, really perked up my Christmas.
Y'know, it'll be okay. It'll be okay. Because when they come over, I will be all charming, I will make them fall in love with me, and then we'll tell 'em.
Yeah, he's better!
Monica, you remember me telling you that joke, right?
Where's Monica?
Well next time ask! Or at least wait for me to ask!
Oh, come on! I don't care! Come on! Whose is it?
They're not even paying ya! This doesn't even sound like a real movie!
Janice?
You do know, I can just turn them the other way around, right?
You mean the guy who kept staring at your chest?
Look, I understand, but I have to put my foot down. Okay? The answer is no.
Yeah, you know, I really thought I deserved it. But... let's go win the lottery... I mean, we still have 130 chances to win, right?
I love you too.
Are you serious?
Oh no no no.. I'll get her. I'm super-compentent and totally responsibile and fourth in line to raise Emma. I'll be right there Emma. Just let me get my trusty diaper bag here. Well.. what do you know? I guess, I'll be the one who dies first.
Yeah well, I'm gonna go spit.
Hey.
There's a Mr. Bing!
Well, you have to honest with her! Otherwise you may think that you're going down the same path, but you're really going down different ones.
Hey Rach, now that you're working at Ralph Lauren, can you bring me back some of those polo shirts?
Well, you owe me one, big guy.
Oh, great. This is just...
Oh, and don't get me wrong, I appreciate the sentiment. It's just that I, I have a rather, sensitive posterior, and ah, besides, it's making all the other guys jealous.
Yeah.
Well where did she go?
Yes. Yes, and ah, ah, the trees are happy too, because for most of them, it's the only chance to see New York.
Now all you have to do is just get through a little bit more, okay? Then we can put you in bed, okay? Just smile and don't talk to anyone.
You're not, what do you, what do you got a bionic foot?
Oh my God, introduce us!
I know, she's been such a big part of my life. And it feels like when Melrose Place got cancelled. I mean... oh, forget it. I miss Melrose Place!
Hey, you said that without gagging!
Okay-dokay, you've each won a game and I've lost what's felt like a year of my life. So everybody goes home a winner.
That's-that's my nubbin.
Yeah.
So that's the girl you like.
Was that Emma? Is she up?
no they don't.
So, a professor, uh?
Do I ever.
Did she look 16?
What do you think she's just gonna sit there quietly? You don't think she's gonna want to make a toast? You don't think she's gonna want to grab the microphone and sing Part-time Lover?!
Thank you, Joey.
I kissed Kathy.
Yes there are, I just saw them a few minutes ago.
C'mon, Ross! You, me, Joey, ice, guys' night out, c'mon, whaddya say, big guy, Huh? Huh? Huh?
Oh I'm so sorry man! Is there anything I can do?
All right, y'know what? Forget it, all of you forget it! You've ruined it! Go home! You've ruined it! You've ruined it!
I don't know. But I know I'm not afraid to do this.
Oh, and Ive got Earth Science, but I'll catch you in Gym.
Hey, sweetums.
Honey, the tortilla chips know what you mean.
Get out. Get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out.
Yeah, I'm putting my foot down. Yeah look, when I proposed I told you that I would do anything to make you happy, and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy, then, then that's what we're gonna do.
Hey, you know what I was thinking? When we get married, are you gonna change your last name to Bing?
That was an obvious joke, and I didn't think of it. Why didn't I think of it? The source of all my powers. Oh dear God, what have I done!
You know when "That's fine" sounds true when someone yells it and spits!
So I got ya something.
You're kidding.
Let's have Monica decide.
Fowl? No. Women? Nooo.
Oh, and I promise, I will not fake it this time.
You think we're ready for something like that?
Yeah?
It was a car backfire!
What are you talking about? We love Schhteve! Schhteve was schhexy!.. Sorry.
So-If you wear that you'll make mine less special.
It was unbelievable. I-I've never met anyone like her. She's had the most amazing life! She was in the Israeli army...
My duties? All right.
Is that supposed to be funny! I was really worried over here!
Oh-no, he's right.
What?
The cranberries...?
I got nothing.
Y'know, if I won $5,000 I'd join a gym, y'know build up my upper body and hit Richard from behind with a stick!
Yes, Joey has a very careful screening process. Apparently, not everyone is qualified to own wood and nails.
What?
I see.
Why?
I said, "Like what?"
...The second guy.
Hey!
There was no fish when she dropped it off.
Be right there sweetums. A totally different situation.
He's the boss's son.
Could be Casey.
Oh, do you not want to?
You've got it.
At a fake game!!
Okay. Okay, now wait a minute that was totally different.
Monica...
No I-I-I'm fine.
Well, yeah, but y'know, what-what if I was wrong?
Look, we're not just messing around! I love her. Okay, I'm in love with her.
Wait. Before we go in, I just want you to know I love you. I had a great time on our honeymoon, and I can't wait to go in there and spend the rest of our life together.
Oh man! I am so excited-I may vomit!
Hey! Remember when I had corneas?
Hang up, hang up. And that was a great movie! I'm so gonna get back at Ross... oh yeah, this will show him, here we go .
What are you guys doing together?
He has sex, and we get hit in our heads.
Well, what did you think, that-that elves came in and fixed it?
Oh what is it honey, you need some tea? Some soup? Oh-ohhhh!
So... Oklahoma is a crazy place. You know, they call it the Sooner state. Frankly I'd sooner be in any other state. And what's with Oklahoma having a pan handle? Can all states have stuff like that? Hey yeah, I'm from the waistband, Wyoming. But when I was seven, we headed over to the crotch.
I'm just going to wait for a little while.
Oh, seriously you want him?
Well I think it's safe to say that our friendship is effectively ruined.
Hi!
Hey, come on, we got the gift, the concert, and the cake.
He's taking off her coat!
Okay.
I'm gonna call and get off work tomorrow!
Right, calm down, O'Mally. I'll slip him some money.
You think I should?
Yes. Okay, there's this one guy, Patrick, I think you're gonna like him, he's really nice, he's funny, he's a swimmer.
Yeah, I mean when you were late last night, Kathy and I got to talking, and one thing to another and...
I hate this thing!
Forget it! Okay, I'm not giving up my bachelor pad for some basketball seats!
Oh, you're definately not. I haven't cried like that in years.
What else is new?
Word!
Whoa!
Okay, look, I'm gonna have to ask you all to leave.
Bullwinkle socks. That's so sweet.
Okay, did you see that?! With the inappropriate and the pinching!!
All right, let me in.
Okay. What was tonight?
God, I'm exhausted.
Y'know, I don't know why you're so embarrassed, they were very nice boobies.
No!
The floating heads do make a good point.
ahem... um... Crystal duck.
Well, that is what happened, and I don't even see you denying this!
All right...
No, had it done to me though. Feels good !
How can you not be wearing any underwear?
You can't make this stuff up!
Fine. We're just sitting here. Alone. Doing nothing. It's our rehearsal for tomorrow.
I don't think you can do that!
Because I'm in love with Monica!!
Can we read it? Can you print out another copy?
I'm not getting into this again!
Is Monica not here?
I want you to say that you like her!
Sure, then you should get a mini skirt so you can really show it off.
Consider Casey.
She was.... But y'know what, just in case, maybe we should come up with a set of ground rules.
Rach, if you have a crush on this guy, why would you hire him? I mean y'know you can't date him right?
Oh, I will. But I will need a mirror... as he is me!
Well, in spite of the yummy bagels and palpable tension, I've got pants that need to be altered.
Actually, I don't like martinis.
Oh really? Then how come no one here is wearing them?
Nice try.
Ken, please! No, I can't, I can't smoke. If I smoke, my wife would kill me.
