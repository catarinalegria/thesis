...so then President Steve told everyone that I was a cheapskate, and now the whole building hates me! A little kid spit on my knee! Y'know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna throw a party. That's right. For everyone in the building, and I'm gonna sit them down and explain to them, I am not a bad guy. I am not a cheap guy! I'm just a guy who-who stands up for what he believes in. A man with principles.
Hey!
Right!
Ok. Here's his diaper bag, and his uh, Mr. Winky, and uh...oh, him. Hi!
Um, you...you like Rachel?
Okay. Okay. Okay.
It would be so cool to live across from you guys!
Marcel is an illegal exotic animal. I'm not allowed to have him in the city. If they find him, they'll take him away from me.
No no, no no, it's not flashy, not for a Goodfella.
Hey! I just spoke to your dad, and you know what? He seems to think we'll be able to find a new place for the wedding.

I guess when you don't have so many distractions, it's easier for you to focus. Huh?
Look, this is my home and I want to be able to come and go whenever I want!
Sure, sweepin'. You never know.
Of... of what?
Really?!
Need some help?
Yeah, yeah, oh!
A pigeon, a pigeon. No, no wait, no-no, an eagle flew in. Landed on the stove and caught fire. The baby, seeing this, jumps across the apartment to the mighty bird's aid. The eagle, however, misconstrues as an act of aggression and grabs the baby on its talon. Meanwhile the faucet fills the apartment with water. Baby and bird still up lays are locked in a death grip, swirling around the whirl pool, that fills the apartment.
Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work. There was this big dinosaur.. thing.. anyway.

Did you say something?
Hi!
Why is it inside out?!
Why? Why can't you go to him?
Hi.

Yeah, I recognize the ankles!
Well, then who was on my bed?
Hey!

Hey guys, does anybody know a good date place in the neighborhood?
Oh, forget it, okay?
Yeah.
What's going on?
God, do you realize in ten years we're gonna be 40?
Yes, I do have a laundry room in my building, um, but there's a.... rat problem. Apparently they're attracted to the dryer sheets, and they're goin' in fine, but they're comin' out all.... fluffy. Anyway, say, sevenish?
Oh-oh, hitting me where it hurts, my ski skills.
Or Joseph.
Okay, here we go...
Halftime.
I just didn't see the fast song coming.
Aw, he's gonna be so happy.
It's not a club.
But, okay.
Yes. Yes I do.
Cousin Frannie's wedding, its tomorrow night.
The uh, the baby that hasn't been born yet? Wouldn't that mean you're... crazy?
Oh...
Hi roomie!
Wait, did you get to the part about his 'huge throbbing pens'? Tell ya, you don't wanna be around when he starts writing with those!

Yeah? Wow! It looks really violent!
Oh, you and me?
I really think they're out of rooms.
I like this song.
Well, I-I was watching her the other day at the pizza place.
Found it.
I can show you, I have it on videotape! It's an expression.
Well, hello Rachel!
Really? You're not gonna return it?
It's also a sign of friendship.
Okay! Okay! Okay. I'm sorry. Please, please, you were in Western Europe and?
And in my defense, the cleaning lady came on to me!
Please hurry.
What?
Well, I just made these two things uhm... cheeks. And then I split this to make ears.
