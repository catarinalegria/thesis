You believe that this guy is destined for someone else and you're still gonna date him?
I got you something from Vermont!
The nerve huh?
Hi!
Well, there you go.
Forget it, that's off.
Oh, don't thank me, thank the jerk that never showed up. Okay, I gotta get to get to work.
Hey! Which one's my turkey burger?
Okay Ross, why don't you come with me?
Wow, it seems serious. What seems to be the problem, Ashley Judd?
Are you just tired now or are you always tired, 'cause that could be a sign of clinical depression.
All right buddy, way to go!
Fancy.
Yeah, Joey said I uh, I needed to relax so he gave me an antihistamine.
Oh.
He's probably in his room with his current girlfriend Charlie. That's the situation as we know it...
Nothing, I just like to go like this.
Carry on.
He's finally happy with that and walks away.
Really?! That's what you heard? You said that?
Well, it's not like I went to Spain. I went to the bathroom, you knew I was coming back.
Yeah.
Thanks.
It's picture time.
Excuse me. . That didn't make us sound gay at all!
And I was a perfect gentleman and I walked her to her hotel room and said goodnight.
Forget what I said, I was babbling! Pick me!
Well, it's just with uhm, work and the stress of adoption, we just don't feel like we have the energy. Plus, we don't think it's fair that every year the burden falls on us.
Okay!
Is not as important as the fact that Phoebe took care of the babies all by herself.
Wait! I just want you to know that... I'm so happy you're going to be here.
Oh my God!!
My Catholic friend is right. She's distraught. You're there for her. You pick up the pieces, and then you usher in the age of Ross!
They got a breakfast buffet.
Don't go.
Pheebs you didn't have to get us anything for our wedding you already sang...
I don't like your massages.
Me! On my computer.
OK, I'm gonna get some more coffee before the pinching and eye-poking begins.
No, it's not that, I just don't want to be stuck here all night with your fat sister.
Ho-ho, you win! 50 dollars!
No. No. We're not gonna do that, y'know why? Because its not an even trade.
Okay, everybody stay here. I will find out what's going on.
Unfortunately that is correct.
And she's... turning on the TV... and watching... Miss Congeniality!
You don't trust him?
Oh y'know, I've been living here a while and I've never seen what's inside that closet. What is, what is in there?
Sounds like a fun party.
I don't know. Should we try it?
It's your mommy. It's your mommy.
So, how would you like to have a baby that's half yours and half his!
Wow! You look amazing!
Oh what's the matter? Are you scared?
Ah, the "I'm sorry I rejected you" phone call. I'm not used to getting it from guys. Hey, Steve.
Oh really?
Uh, if I were omnipotent for a day, I'd.. make myself omnipotent forever.
Okay.
Well, she spent the last six months getting over him, and now she's celebrating that by going on a date with him.
Hey.
I was giving you some of my best moves, and you missed it. So please wake up so we can do it right!
Alright, here's ten.
So, Saturday night, the big night, date night, Saturday night, Sat-ur-day night!
Oh, good. Rog is here.
Uh, if you say so sir.
You ah, you have, you have to leave, now? How come?
What?
All right look, forget it, forget it. You told her you love her, it's over.
I'm sorry. I, I told you I was in Tulsa because I wanted to spend the night with Monica and I, I didn't know . . . I didn't think you'd understand.
Well, it's not your fault. What are you gonna do? Not take her to the hospital? Y'know? You're doing nothing wrong. Except for harboring an all consuming love for the woman whose carrying his baby. Richard? If-if you're in there, could you pass me my credit card?
The one time they're not home.
Yeah, at least you hid your feelings well about it.
Really? Then what are they doing in our guestroom?
Richard was there so I couldn't do it!
Monica, that was also true an hour ago! I mean, please, look at you! Your hand is blistered, you can barely stand, your hair is inexplicable! Ok, you've already proven you are just as good as he is, now we've missed our dinner reservations, so now let's just go upstairs, order room service, take a shower and shave your head!
Hey!
Okay. What was tonight?
What are you doing?
Well, you're welcome! Glad I could help.
Hey.
I'll try to stop. Wait, did you say until the sixth?
Oh, now? No, no, I think something this nice should be saved for a special occasion.
You didn't get more movies that are gonna have us reaching for the tissues all night did you?
Unbelievable
No it's not. It's small. It's tiny. It's petite. It's wee.
And you... Ross, I believe, if you check Rachel's bag you will find a half-eaten box of cookies in there.
Okay. All right.
Is it just me, or can you actually see his abs through his overcoat?!
Really? What happened?
No!
The problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter how great the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y'know? I mean, we're in the car, we're fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake.
Where's your passport?
You are totally and completely 100% forgiven.
What happened to 'you can't live without me four days a week'?
No bunny at all!! Always no bunny at all!!!
What are you guys talking about?
Okay.
What?
Yeah me too.
Shocking! Since you still have the keys.
Right on! Oh! Uh, but, don't take to long okay? 'Cause uh, we're gonna test out our fake ID's tonight, right Clifford Alverez.
What?!
I will have the uh, Cajun catfish.
All right, you want to see if the joke stealer will let us watch the show at his place?
Seriously?
Fears and Pet Peeves.
Well, I tried Billy Jean King, but... you know, you and Monica have the same "I'm gonna kill you" look...? I can usually make it go away by kissing her...
Diagnostician or boo-boo fixer?
Hey! Did you find the cameras?
All right!!
Okay, I've been doing a lot of thinking about us, y'know a lot of uhh, us thinking. And uh, well I guess there's only one-one way to do this.
What?
Yes, and I get my ya-yas from Ikea. You have to put them together yourself, but they cost a little less.
At a fake game!!
Oh, I will. But I will need a mirror... as he is me!
Orange juice.
What're you kidding? I broke up with her. She actually thought that Sean Penn was the capital of Cambodia.
I got something for her. It's a book!
Ahhhh!
Yeah, and there's a bowl of cranberry sauce that... what happens to cranberry sauce?
Okay, great.
Night-night.....Janice. 'Look at all that room on her side, you good fit a giant penguin over there. That would be weird though. Okay, hug and roll time. I'm huggin', I'm huggin', your rollin', and....yes! Freedom! Except for this arm! I'm stuck. Stuck arm! Okay, time for the old table cloth trick, one fluid motion. Quick like a cat, quick like a cat! And 1...2...3!'
Hi, um, I'm account number 7143457. And, uh, I don't know if you got any of that, but I would really like a copy of the tape.
Yeah! You graduated Magma Ku Laude, right?
Hello? Hey Charlie, what do you know?
Lick away my man.
Hey!
This is Chandler Bing! This is Chandler Bing! Yes, the groom-No! Not the groom!!
Are you telling me that you bought the chair that is making all other lounge systems obsolete? The chair that Sit magazine called the Chair of the Year?
Hey, whoa-whoa! What's she like?
Look, we have enough, just walk away.
So... Oklahoma is a crazy place. You know, they call it the Sooner state. Frankly I'd sooner be in any other state. And what's with Oklahoma having a pan handle? Can all states have stuff like that? Hey yeah, I'm from the waistband, Wyoming. But when I was seven, we headed over to the crotch.
If I took this promotion, it'd be like admitting that this is what I actually do.
I'm gettin' my chair back!
Excuse me?
Oh yeah, totally!
Well this is great! I'll give you a call! We should do it again sometime!
What did you just do?
You sure?
Okay. How about in that cabinet?
I'm a little bit uncomfortable with the that way you express yourself.
Oh no-no-no. This is amazing.
Yeah, I do.
Yes.
Ok, Phoebe.
Honey, isn't it possible that the company that sold the jeans made more than just the one pair?
Yeah, and someday when you're ready, you'll make it past the hedges.
No he didn't.
Oh my God.
Look it was a lo-o-ong time ago.
Yes, yes I did, but what I didn't say was what I was about to say, what I wanted to say was, uh... would you like to go out with me sometime, thankyou, goodnight.
Right in there!
I got glasses!
Oh-ho-ho-ho.
Oh, well... Maybe I'll join them some time. I just hope the club doesn't slip out of my hand and beat the moustache off his face.
Man, that's some bad advice!
Because you know how competitive you get and well, I say it's cute, others disagree, and I'm lying!
Alright! Just follow my lead!
Oh, good! Good! Do you guys know how to get a chick out of a VCR?!
Oh, it's so hard to care when you're this relaxed.
How do you feel about that?
All right! Isn't this a woman's hat?
Mento?
Doctor Connelly just called.
No.
This is not out of the blue, this is smack dab in the middle of the blue.
You're gonna put on sweats and clean, aren't you?
Oh, they said uh, "You don't have insurance here, so stop calling us."
Yes we're all in here and we would love for you to join us!
Well, sure, but can you play it on a plane?
Y'know you, really didn't have to take me to the airport.
Oh. Well, hold on camper, are you sure you've thought this thing through?
Ooh! Calm down ...
No way! If anything you've gotta let me win! My wife thinks I'm a wimp!
Okay. What if we lived together and you understand what I'm saying?
Four different women! I've had sex way more times!
What?
And no one touches the air around the TV!
All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring. Now I don't know what to do, everybody starts looking at me.
Is it me, or have the greetings gone downhill around here?
So.... I quit.
Nothing, except tell you, uh, I think it's wonderful how much energy you have.
With extra pulp?
So excited about your letter!
Okay, well, it's definite, two more weeks of winter.
Where you going, Joe?
I hope she throws up on you.
Well, we are fond of the silliness, but we also have a soft spot for the love.
An hour.
Ross, don't press send, don't press se... !
Okay. Bye.
Really?
Hey Joe!
Yeah, that's her.
Right. Right. Well ah, y'know we could flip for it.
We were two miles from the house. Scared and alone. We didn't think we could make it.
That's what you got me?
Okay...
Oh and Ross was like what? A lion tamer?
Well she, she wouldn't do that, she's with, she's with me.
I don't... uh... understand.
Ok.
It was fine, y'know? But she didn't agree with me as strongly as she agreed with Joey. She was more like, "I see you point, I'm all right with it."
Joey, why is your cable out?
Rachel... with handcuffs! Interesting!
Yeah, I know, for a really great stew you just y'know, stick your head in between 'em.
What?! It's not right! We're not ready to have a kid now!!
Okay, it's um...
By then, the cheesecake may have gone bad. We don't want her to come back to bad cheesecake.
I'm not gonna mess it up.
Pulling flowers out it makes the bag look a lot more masculine.
Why did I get married?!
Well... we-we do. You can only eat Tic Tacks in even numbers.
Just a little bit of sugar.
Yes?
Oh my God, how did you do that?
Hey!
He said...he said, he said that they're having a great time. I'm sorry. But, the silver lining, if you wanna see it, is that he made the decision all by himself! Without any outside help whatsoever.
I don't know. But I-I-I know I love you!
Wait. Advertising! That's a great idea!
Do you think I work at some kind of boot pricing company?
No!
I just think it's weird, you know? Heckles and me, Heckles, and me, me and Heckles...Would you knock it off?
Hello? Hello?
Why haven't you told them?!
Ugh. Just a sec, give me a minute to wake up for this-Ah-ha-ha!! You lost the ring! You're the worst best man ever!
So ah, whatcha watching?
You are so great! I love you!
He's the boss's son.
You don't turn and slide, you throw it out! I'm tired of having to get a tetanus shot every time I get dressed!
You're pretending the pillow's a girl right?
Yeah, we're gonna have to get you out of those shoes.
Ross, don't. Ross!
Yep!
So, are you really gonna go out with that nurse man?
Well that would help the pride thing.
Yeah, we were gonna give fifty, but if you guys gave more, we don't wanna look bad.
Well, I just...
Wow, Heckles was voted class clown, and so was I. He was right. Would you listen to that?
Seriously sir, my brains? All over the wall.
Yeah, wow.
Oh, I'm fine about my problem now, by the way.
No, no, see? See? Hey, it's printing. Hey, it's printing!
Yeah?
There's another carton right over there.
All right, think about it. Now remember when you were going out with that girl Donna and you guys broke up. Remember how horrible it was when you guys bumped into each other at the supermarket?
Hi.
Yes indeedy! With a beautiful view of...
All right, just, just take the entertainment center, and then when you get home, throw the canoe away!
No. I mean I believe that uh, certain people are more suited for each other and I believe in falling in love, but soul mates, I don't think they exist.
Hey.
Yes-yes, I was just trying to figure out a way to uh, demonstrate how I could get my exceptionally large feet into my even bigger mouth.
Come on, it was like cousins having sex up there!
Oh wow, I hope you don't take this the wrong way but, I know we had plans to meet up tonight and, ugh, I'm just kinda worried about what it might do to our friendship.
OK, alright, last minute lesson, last minute lesson. Joey... three... eight. Eight... three. Alright babe, deal the cards.
Uhh yeah. Yeah, it's right, right down there. Right there, yeah. Can I ask you why?
I was surprised to see a kangaroo in a World War I epic.
Which I bought for ya. Taught ya how to use it. You thought it was a copier. Look, if there was anything I could do, I would do it. Okay? But everybody's allowed one mistake, right?
Mrs. Braverman must be out.
I have no idea.
Yes, if it really doesn't mean anything, because you know that I'm just not ready...
I am sorry, but some of us have to get up early and go to work! He does not know that I am not some of us.
Na, forget it, it's probably stripped and sold for parts by now.
Okay, that's enough honey!
I think it's great. Y'know, it's sweet, it's romantic...
Oh come on! Are you listening to this?
Hey, anybody got a length of rope about six feet long with a little nouse at the end?
I can't believe this! What the hell were you thinking?
Uh, two larges, extra cheese on both. But listen, don't ring the buzzer for 19, ring 20, Geller-Green, they'll let you in, OK. If you buzz our door, there's no tip for you. OK, thanks. Pizza's on the way. I told you we wouldn't have to get up.
Because soap is soap. It's self-cleaning.
Actually, we're trying, and I don't think Monica's gonna wanna postpone it. We're supposed to have sex tonight. Actually, she's probably at home naked right now. I tend to keep talking until somebody stops me. I can just picture her on the bed right now.
Y'know what, it doesn't matter, 'cause she picked me. Me! From now on I get the dates and you have to stay home on Saturday nights watching Ready, Set, Cook!
That, that is funny. Can I have it back?
Don't worry honey, we'll make yours funnier.
You guess I'm right? When we stayed at that bed and breakfast, you wouldn't have sex with me because you thought a deer was staring through the window.
Oh, I don't know, a million?
I pity the fool who puts on my jewelry, I do, I do. I pity the fool that. . . Hi!
Yes! Remember? Right before we cut the cake, I went up to you and I said...
That's why!
I have to; he's my best friend, and you're seeing him.
Okay first of all, the impression, uncanny. And second, that was not flirting, that was just casual conversation between two people. That is all.
Okay I promise. I'll-I'll hate it. Wow! You-you look...hideous.
Yes. Right where?
Whoa, whoa, prom night flashback.
So uh, what's this thing you're auditioning for?
And this has nothing to do with the fact that he needs a note to get out of gym.
Well, Ross and Emily aren't gonna use it.
Yes, I know, but her friend sounds like such a...
Santa? Really?
Well... there's surrogacy, but Monica has dreamt her whole life of carrying a child, she has felt that watching a surrogate would be... too hard for her.
I do like that.
Y'know, we don't have to watch this. Weekend At Bernie's is on Showtime, HBO, and Cinemax.
A pharmacist.
Hey!
But I am willing to offer her all those things. This was just a plan, y'know? A way to throw her off course so that when I offered her all these things, she'd be surprised!
Your pants!
You are beautiful.
Guys guys, check this out.
Honey, try to focus the trash talk on him!
So?!
I see.
Thank you.
Aren't you...?
Hey! Stop staring at my wife's legs! No no! Stop staring at your sister's legs!
Hey, look Joey, I'm just saying if you need something to hold you over, I can get you a job right here as an entry level processor.
Yep! And! A beautiful woman agreed to go out with me. Joey wanted to ask her out, but uh, she picked me.
My specimen is in the room and I just want to thank whoever knocked on the door while I was in there. Really helped speed the process along! Janice! You're not... gone?
Who's he huggin'?
How do you know so much about this?
Pretty well. Except for the stapler thing. Little tip: if youre ever in a similar situation, never ever leave your hand... ..on the desk.
I'm not seeing Monica.
Ya know if you want to, I can just hold them down and you could .
I can't believe you got us into trouble.
Awesome, the name really stands out.
Sorry, you had a paleontologist on your face. But, uh, it's gone now, you're alright.
All right, I have to get that, but no-no. Hello? Hi! Yeah listen, I'm, I'm in need of a stripper and I was told that you do that. Let me ask you this, what, what do you do for the extra hundred? So would I, would I have to provide the grapes?
Would you like to have dinner sometime?
Hey, that's...'joincidence' with a 'C'!
Monica, you remember me telling you that joke, right?
What?
Well, that makes me feel so good.
There's the man.
Okay! Oh man! Don't tell me I did this!
Oooo-ooh!
Uh-huh.
Oh no-no-no-no-no-no, vomit tux! No-no, vomit tux!
Well y'know, Monica and I were friends before we started dating. So maybe-maybe that's it?
See, that's why I could never be an actor. Because I can't say gig.
Top of the world? Dock of the bay? I'm out.
Yeah, and I don't wanna brag but a lot of the ideas were mine! Hell, you weren't there? All the ideas were mine!!!
Now, do I get to look at this book or is it just for people who are actually involved in the wedding?
Well, hello!
At least let me smoke it to the good part.
David, let me stop you there 'cause I think I see where this is going. I'm not very good at giving advice. So if you want advice, go to Ross, Monica, or... Joey, if the thing you wanna advice about is pizza toppings or burning sensation when you pee.
How is that me?
But I do know that it's some time tomorrow.
Honey, there are like 20 tickets on the nightstand!
Wow! You look just like your son Mrs. Tribbiani!
The door hasn't been locked in five years, but okay! Ready?!
Yuck!
Look, I just don't think Monica and I are ready to get married yet! Y'know? I mean, I love her and everything but seeing Ross and Rachel coming out of that chapel was like a, like a wake-up call that Monica and I are moving so fast. Y'know? And, how do I tell her without crushing her?
Freedom! I want my freedom! Why won't you here me?! Sophie, help me! Help me!!
Oh come on, it was so obvious! There was no chemistry between you two!
No thank you.
What does yours say Pheebs?
I like it in the stern. ...of the boat. Hello.
Yeah.
I think you should take the job.
Oh my God this doesn't count! Okay? The interview was over, that was the real Chandler Bing in there, this is just some crazy guy out in the hall! Call security! There's a crazy guy out in the hall!
Actually Monica and I are engaged.
And now you're giving me the message!
No! No! No! I just kissed her.
Hey! Did you have the baby yet?
Sure!
You mind if I...
Soo, ah, Eric, what kind of photography do ya do?
To the left, to the left- aww!
Hey!
I don't know. I just had this weird sense. You know, but that's me. I'm weird and sensitive. Tissue?
Uh, Rach... I think I have something that belongs to you.
Wha-
Hey!
Ohh, so?
And then the peacock bit me. Please kiss me at midnight.
All right. I'll tell you what. When we're 40, if neither one of us are married, what do you say you and I get together and have one?
Are we in London?
I also got this great salt and pepper shaker from the restaurant.
Well, listen, don't tell us what's gonna happen though, 'cause I like to be surprised.
Joey! Joe! Full bag. Beer's still cold. Something terrible must've happened here! Oh no-no-no-no-no-no! Stevie, I was never here!
You're welcome.
But those are the words! Those exact words!
No! No, she didn't say that. I-I-I think you should talk to Monica now.
Okay. Then I guess it's just, wait here then. Hi. I need one fake ticket to Yemen.
Monica! Wait!
Aside from adoption the only other choice is insemination, so... we're talking about sperm donors.
Okay. But if you don't come back soon, there's pretty much nothing I can do about it!
I wanted to be with you. I missed you so much.
Y'know what, I know what will cheer you guys up! I had a little talk with the boys in New York, told 'em about all the hard work you've been doing and that a little Christmas bonus may be in order.
I spent the entire day with you, why didn't you tell me?!
And, a lemon lime.
Hey, you guys! Hey, Ross, quick question for ya. Are you ready to party?
Look, are you gonna be ok?
Look, she's not backing down! She went like this!
Is that why you became a chef? So that people would like you?
The only way that I said six would be if the seven's, let meet at seven, not at six.
Yeah Ross, I mean... we're excited to hear the speech but the rest of the time we're gonna wanna do, you know, "island's stuff".
Look Joe, I just, I just don't want to get your hopes up real high.
Why?
Too?
Fun Bobby? Your ex-boyfriend Fun Bobby?
Well now you understand how I feel every single day, ok? The world is my lesbian wedding.
I thought you said those jokes were funny. Joke! Joke! Joke!
How do Monica and Phoebe know?
Fine, I'll give the suit back.
Y'know, I sensed that I should stop. So we're okay?
It's not charity, Joe...
Well, you...don't look good Joe.
The young hot ball and chain.
Yeah. Good call, nice one. Hold it!! Hold it! What if me eyes are closed, and, and my hand is out there....
Okay, a little problem. The key broke in the lock and I can't get in!
Take off your shirt!
That would be impossible to resist if you weren't all drippy here.
Oh, that's great.
That is the exact same thing.
98. 99. 100. Okay, go!
Hey man, look it's my best bud. How ya doin? Wow, you are really gettin' good at that Marcel Marceau thing. Hey, whaddya say uh, we play some ball, you and me, huh, whaddya say? OK, that's my bad.
Oh uh, as it turns out, we can't do it. Monica has to work.
Happy Anniversary, 10 months!
It's 6:00.
Don't worry, I'll be back before you know it. Yes it will be the same. Because I know, that's how. I promise.
Hey, what time is it? The big game is about to start!
I don't know. Maybe.
Look, when I've been drinking, sometimes I tend to get overly friendly, and I'm sorry.
Du-ude!
Thank you. I got a job in advertising.
Well, what did she say?
Ross, that was 16 years ago!
Well I, I think we'd remember something like that.
Not well.
Yes, and we'd appreciate it if no one told him yet.
Yeah?
Oh.
Oh, what can happen? I mean, would you...
Oh, okay.
So we both finished our vows.
Okay, here is the phone bill.
You really like it?
Can you people not see me?!
Hey!
You don't think we'd buy a house and not have a Joey room do you?
Batman has a utility belt!
Wish I could switch with someone. I really don't wanna sit with Allen Iverson over there.
Yeah umm, they're called wallets.
Ehh, you're just liquored up.
I can see the headline now: "Lottery winners' friend filled with regret eats own arm".
I'm back.
Oh, uh, yeah... I just knew that sometimes when you're writing, you... you don't always know the exact time.
Okay, then get the lobster!
Thanks for trying. Oh, and by the way there is no Count Rushmore!
Oh yeah, you got the big TV. We'll be over there all the time. . . except when we are here.
Yeah.
It's Clint. It's Clint!
Well, it'll probably slow it down at first but, once I get used to the extra weight, I'll be back on track.
Yeah or also when you don't have somebody breathing down your neck ALL THE LIVE LONG DAY!!
Well, maybe since the age of 9, Frannie's made some new friends.
Well, first of all, they're not called "sneakers" anymore. Apparently, they're called "kicks" or "skids" and I think I heard somebody say "slorps". And here, look: they've got these wheels to pop out from the bottom so you can roll around 'cause, apparently, walking is too much exercise. Kids, kids, roll your way to childhood obesity! Would you help me try to sell these?
Are you kidding? Okay, I'll give you a hint; I'll give you a hint.
Okay. And get ready to taste my very special cranberries. Or should I say... chanberries!
So Steve said he had to go to the doctor. And Steve's doctor's name is Doctor Muppy. So I said, 'Doctor Monkey?' And that is how the whole Doctor Monkey thing came up.
I'm so sorry.
Who did you originally want to hook up with?
Hey, that's not good. Can I get an espresso and a latte over here, please?
Really?! You do that?
No problem.
Thank you! All right, I gotta go unpack.
There's no-one around. Why don't we just take this one?
Actually, it's Miss Chinandolor Bong.
I didn't know that.
Water! Water! Water!
Joey, this is Die Hard 1 again.
To Ross!
Okay.
Uh, Ross?
Stop that now!
Eldad, sit down. Move over! Move over now!
Alright! That is it. This is our apartment and you can not behave this way. Now if you can't act your age then you shouldn't be here at all. Now those plates may not be as nice as the pretty pink ones I picked out, but they're very important to Monica. I want you to apologize to her right now.
Well, I thought if I littered, that crying Indian might come by and save us.
Well, it throws my WENUS out of whack.
There you go! There you are!
Excuse me...
Okay. Oh yes.
I understand.
No, no, no. No-no-no.
Me too.
'kay, look: Can we just drop this? I'm not gonna smoke again.
It's an old key!
Oh yes!
I know. Can you believe it? One year ago today I was just your annoying friend Chandler.
So, where's Mike?
What?
. Well played.
What?
Yeah, yeah, she works over at that place, uh...
Oh please, and you knew how much I liked her.
It still wouldn't be clean. All I want is my freedom.
Listen, they are really great. If you just got a chance...
How long it took to go back in the water?
As crazy as soccer?
Yes! Yes! A thousand times, yes!
Phoebs, play with meeee.
Hi.
It is starting to get dark out there.
Very informative!
Maybe we finish this for him! "Also I cloned a dinosaur in my lab. She's now my girlfriend. I don't care what society says. It's the best sex I've ever had"... aaand SEND!
I'm sorry you misunderstood...
Well, you're gonna have to leave sometime, because you both have jobs, and as soon as you do, we're switching it back! There's nothing you can do to stop us! Right, Joe?
This is not going to work.
What?!
Hey.
Sorry, we're on a major flan high.
PUSH! PUSH! PUSH!
I don't think you did a very thorough job!
Uh-oh.
Yeah, or you can do the easy thing and smoke.
The cranberries...?
No-no! This is my fiancee and her heart was set on that ring. You don't want to break her heart now do you?
Oh, hello Rachel.
What's up?
Hey!
Yes. It's very difficult to appreciate a Thanksgiving dinner once you've seen it in reverse.
What the hell is this?
Y'know I think you can take her.
For a minute there I thought you were actually tryin' to smell something.
Can you hear that?
Oh-ho, it'll be back. Oh-ho, there's nobody in the room.
Well it couldn't have been worse. A woman literally passed through me. OK, so what is it, am I hideously unattractive?
Yeah baby!
That's-that's my nubbin.
And you're our age. You're our age.
No, it wasn't you.
Some guy, Tom Gordon.
I don't know... um, Grease?
You said no right?!
Is that what this is about? You like Caitlin?
Oh!
Okay, who wore those?
Oh, uhm... I have to work too. Yeah, I'm stuck at the office all day.
Yes!
OK, so now we draw cards.
Noo!
Joey, if I go first, I wanna be looking for my keys.
No, nono, don't- don't worry about it. Believe me, apparently other people have made the same mistake.
Why is Phoebe singing to Carl Mulden?
Bye.
Well, maybe he had some kind of uh, new, cool style, that you're not familiar with. And uh maybe you have to get used to it.
Look! Look! Look what the... Look what... Look what the floating heads did!
Well, I'll tell ya I do enjoy guilt, but, ah, it wasn't me.
Yeah, well, she's probably talking to Richard.
Well, this was great. I'll give you a call. We should do it again sometime.
Yes, but haven't you wanted a kid like forever?
Carol? I was just wondering if Joey could ask you a question about breast-feeding?
Oh, and don't get me wrong, I appreciate the sentiment. It's just that I, I have a rather, sensitive posterior, and ah, besides, it's making all the other guys jealous.
Yeah, this is so good, that I'm gonna go enjoy it on the balcony so that I can enjoy the view whilst I enjoy my dessert.
Yeah well, I'm gonna go spit.
Maybe we'll have to listen and see!
God that is good TV.
G'night.
Damn it.
Okay.
Well, the movie was great, dinner was great, and there's nothing like a cool, crisp New York evening.
We are NOT signing those papers.
The tall girl who wouldn't sleep with you?
Well that's good. Because you didn't! And I'm incredibly happy for ya!!
I'll take one. Sometimes I like to hold stuff like this and pretend I'm a giant.
yeah just some good old fashion girl on girl American action.
You kissed her that night too?
Hey.
For camp!
Okay, we owe you a present.
Howdy doody.
We have heard you play.
To Put the Camera Away!!!
Whose is it?
So, has anyone talked to Dr. and Mrs. Geller yet?
Easy for you to say; you'll be wearing a veil.
That's still in there?!
Okay, hear me out. Okay? You give the best bad massages. If anybody was looking for the best bad massage and they were thinking to themselves, "Who's the best of that?" They'd have to go to you.
Well, that's like money in your pocket! - Alright look, you want me to say it? This sucks. Being here sucks! This work sucks!
I'm out of words. Should I just say the whole thing again?
Pick me, I look great in a tux and I will not steal focus.
no I'm not quite sure you got the right movie that's all.
Janice, I'm sorry but umm, you can't stay here tonight.
You look amazing. I'm the luckiest man in the world.
Okay.
Well, how could anyone not be in love with Yasmine Blepe?
Hey, you're gonna be fine. You're one of the most caring, most responsible men in North America. You're gonna make a great dad.
Hello. Hi, Janice! Can you hold on for a second? Okay. Okay, what do I do?
Too many jokes... must mock Joey!
You know what... these aren't half-bad! You should suggest something like these to Ralph Lauren.
Uh-huh.
Oh, she's at home, putting up decorations for Rachel's birthday party tonight.
Look, we've always talked about having babies someday. I'm not saying it has to be right now, but I'm starting to think that we can handle it. We're good. We're really good.
It feels like we're cheating on our house. And if we're gonna cheat, shouldn't it be with like a hot, younger house, that does stuff that our house won't do?
Would you please get some rest!
Chandler, Chandler Bing. I'm not gay, I'm not gay at all.
No.
How come?
Hey, just because this woman thinks she can actually see Joey through the magical box in her living room doesn't mean she's not a person. I mean, does she not deserve happiness, does she not deserve love? What're you lookin' at me for? He's the one who wants to boff the maniac.
If I was a superhero who could fly and be invisible, that would be the best.
Ooh, this is a Dear Diary moment.
I'm not yanking you.
So I guess it's just uh, you and me then.
Well it's not flexed right now!
We're back!
I'll go.
Yes, and we're very excited about it.
Yep, I'm in a tree.
She was not good. Not good.
No! No! Not, Paris.
Totally.
You really want to take me?
So those were pity laughs? PITY LAUGHS?
Oh, hurry up. I want to sign that.
I don't know, Richard's really nice and everything, uh, it's just that we don't know him really well, ya know, and plus he's, ya know, old -er than some people, but, uh, younger than some buildings.
Oh yes.
Yes, Bravo on the hot nanny.
To be fair this one does have nuts.
What? What? Why?!
I know!
No! No! No! I was so careful!
You have to give 'em something, you know. Okay, now that was Gerston, Santos, and who's the guy with the moustache?
Yeah, yeah. Some people said some nice things about him. I think somebody should have it.
Yes, Joey has a very careful screening process. Apparently, not everyone is qualified to own wood and nails.
God, I'm exhausted.
Oh, so that's what this is for.
Why not?
Okay, if you see a little version of me in there? Kill it!
It's my joke.
Great, a faster way to tell people that I'm unemployed and childless .
There you go!
Whoa!
I could die.
No! Ahhh!!!
Thanks man.
Huh.
That is a great idea! And by the way, I don't mean to sound distasteful, but when did you start crapping money!?
Ding dong, the psycho's gone.
What...? That's not you! Life is good again! Ride 'em cowgirl!
Oh, it's nothing, it's a little thing... I hate that guy.
Oh, sure, she was probably up all night, excited about the party she knows is happening.
Your parents caught Ross smoking pot in college and he blamed it on me!
I'm sorry. Hey, at least you guys get to go home and be with your families tonight. I have to go back to an empty hotel room and lay down on a very questionable bedspread. And then tomorrow morning, you get to have Christmas morning in your own houses, wich, by the way, none of you have invited me to.
I'm gonna go tell Emma she was an accident.
Wow that was my scariest voice! You're very brave.
Hi.
I don't know what that's like?! Up until I was 25 I thought the only response to, "I love you," was, "Oh crap!"
Come on! I was there! I know he's the love of your life.
Yeah, see, I can't pull of baby-doll can I?
How do you feel?
They left.
Joey's tailor...took advantage of me.
Oh no thats okay, you're totally right. I don't know anything about disciplining a child. But it did hurt my feelings and I want you to know that when I die, you don't get Joey. Ross walks away with a face of yeah ok. Amy walks over to the couch and sits down next to Rachel: Ucch. Uchh In case you hadn't noticed, I'm not talking to you.
Hey.
Okay, that's like the least fun game ever.
I'm an alien. I'm an alien.
Y'know what, we have to turn off the porn.
That's not true. I came with Monica and I'm leaving with Weird Al.
Yeah-yeah, me neither.
Deposit my specimen? You know, usually I have to call a 900 number for that kind of talk. Thanks, got it.
Then we will sprinkle rose pedals on the bed and make love. Not just because it's romantic, but because I can!
Yeah?
How was your date with Joey?
You wanna share it?
So uh Monica, do you, do you like the Law & Order?
You did?
Is that Joey?! Let me talk to him!
Yes, yes, we had the sex.
You gotta let me slam the door!
Monica and I are engaged.
Hey!
It's a kitchen slash bathroom.
Hmmm, that's very cool.
Hey, how's the first day goin'?
So that's the girl you like.
Come on, Rach.
No, that was Dana Caplin.
Say goodbye elves, I'm off to Tulsa.
Hey.
It got interesting! Damn you Oprah!
Is it really that bad?
Okay, let me just straighten out your helmet there.
Yes have you seen any?
Why can't you tell her?
Okay. 1...2...3-Go! I'm gonna kill myself!
The floating heads do make a good point.
Yes, this, this was pleasant.
Oh, is this about you-you dating the nurse? Yeah, Joey already told me, and I am so-so fine. I mean, you and I we're just, y'know, we're nothing, we're goofin' around.
That's not really important right now. What is important is; while we appreciate the gesture, we just don't feel bagpipes are appropriate for our wedding.
All right, that's it, give me your underwear.
4:00 A.M.
Is that a problem?
Ok, ok, you can be shirts and I'll be skins. I'll be skins. Hey, how you holdin' up there, tiger? Oh, sorry, when my parents were getting divorced I got a lot of tigers. Got a lot of champs, chiefs, sports, I even got a governor.
So, a professor, uh?
I think it's the dying cat parade.
Hey!
That would be a lot more convincing if you weren't drooling.
What are you going to do?
He's Greek Orthodox.
Okay, then you gotta back away, all right? You don't need that kind've hurt. Take it from a guy who's never had a long term relationship......
Oh, and you know whose knowledge of her ex-boyfriend is shocking? Monica!
Hey.
Okay, Ms. McKenna, she kind of works above my boss, she asked me to move to Tulsa and be the president of our office there, and I was sleeping and apparently, said yes.
Football? Just football?
I KNOW!!!
Yes, but I-I uh, don't have too.
...and then it got canceled.
Oh, yeah... yeah.
Hi, Pheebs!
Just for a few seconds, so I can know what it is... Please?
Okay, I accept that. When Janice asked me and I said no, she took that to mean that I was calling her a cow.
Then, I might as well ... do this . Not really sure what to do now.
How are you feeling?
Oh, she's regional Vice President; She's... just below me.
I'm right! Right? There was like no chemistry between them. Before they had heat, and now there's no heat! Now you know what this means, Joey told us what this means!
That's what you should say.
Uh-oh.
You mean a three pointer?
I'm not getting into this again!
Come on, Ross? Remember back in college, when he fell in love with Carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?
I mean, I was sitting there.
I dunno, aren't there tests for these things, right?
See, honey, there's-
Ok honey. that was close. -Cut to Rachel.
Why would I be mad?
Fowl? No. Women? Nooo.
Yes, I did. Yes, I did. Because, you're my girlfriend, and that's what girlfriends should, should get.
Hey, you know what you can do? I remember reading about this director, I think it was Orson Wells, who at the beginning of the movie would hire somebody, just so he could fire them in front of everybody. Then they would all know, who's boss.
Me too. I wanna find a baby that needs a home and I wanna raise it with you. And I wanna mess it up in our own specific way.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah! These are the faces of two people in the know!
Yeah. Oh no wait, I'm not an nine-year-old girl.
I have no name.
I'm so sorry...
Yes, we do. But, we have to change first.
Really?
Okay, okay-okay, ah, Chloe works with that guy Issac. Issac's sister is Jasmine. And Jasmine works at that message place with Phoebe. And Phoebe's friends with Rachel. And that's the trail, I did it!
Oh yeah, gym member. I try to go four times a week, but I've missed the last 1200 times.
You don't want to be guys, you'd be all hairy and wouldn't live as long.
Oh-no-no-no! Don't! Don't! See-see, you're getting me confused, I'm starting to urn.
Okay, one thing at a time.
Aahhuuhhh....
Do you have any beers? We're out of beers.
I'll bet his dad doesn't think so.
Yeah, I think that's wrong, but there's a Connect the Dots in here for you later. Hey, how about maroon?
Oh, I'm sorry, so 'we' is?
That's laughter.
Hey, so can you make it on Friday?
Oh, right, right, shut up.
Are you asking permission to break the pact?
You know, I don't mean to brag, but I waited tables at Innsbruck in '76. Amouz-bouche?
Hi sweetie. So, what was with all the whispering?
In a minute? What's gonna happen in a minute?!
So? What? What? They're gone! Monica's gonna freak!
Picturing that tree?
There we go!
Question. If I don't care about my watch, can I use it as a weapon?
You're turning into a woman.
Oh, how well you know me...
Wait, we can't do this.
Monica's a little drunk.
Pheebs, can you help me pick out an engagement ring for Monica? I can't figure this out! It's so hard! Should I get her a Tiffany cut or a Princess cut or a-ah-ah! Paper cut!
Well, your gonna need much bigger jars.
Our minister...
No. I'm not letting you or anybody else see, ever.
So Rachel's all moved out huh? How are you taking it?
And, ah, you know, your fooling around with her. And you get all these like, mental images in your brain, you know, like Elle MacPherson, or that girl at the Xerox place....
No we didn't!
Oh my God!
And I'm cute too.
Hey now besides, if worst comes to worst, I'll be your boyfriend.
Oh My God! You can do a duet of Ebony and Ivory all by yourself!
Your sister Joan is crazy.
Ooh, you know, I had a grape about five hours ago, so I'd better split this with you.
Oh yeah? Well, how'd she take it?
Because, if Santa and the Holiday...Armadillo? ...are ever in the same room for too long the universe will implode. Merry Christmas!
Well, why can't you do them tomorrow?
Yes, we're standing out ground...apparently.
Hi Joey's sisters!
Okay.
Who are you? Ansel Adams?! Get outta here!
No-no-no-no! That was the joke!
Y'know I was thinking, what if I uh, unpack here?
Well, actually it's a hockey team, so it's angry Canadians with no teeth.
Wait, if we're lucky, and we're really really really quiet, we may be able to hear the sound of a condom breaking!
Y'know, I, I really don't think we need a canoe.
Hell is filled with people like you.
We have to bust it open, but neither of us can do it!
But wait a minute though, how are we gonna get there, though, because my Mom won't let me cross the street.
So you're really okay with this?
Don't do it.
Yes I did, and I think you should do it.
Yeah, I believe I was talking to Joey, alright there, Mother-Kisser?
How did the job stuff go?
What?
As bad as that went I actually enjoyed myself. I think that I'm going to apologize for all of the stupid things I do.
Oh no.
Work, Joe!
Hey look, are we gonna have to bring this out every time Ross comes over?
Do you remember talking to me yesterday?
Y'know, I forgot the combination to this about a year ago? I just carry it around. Do you have any Chap Stick?
That's patio furniture!
She gets crazy! This scar is from Pictionary!
That was her.
You are an amazing wife. No really you're amazing you were actually gonna do this for me, I mean where do you find the strength and understanding over something like that.
The... Jamestown colony of Virginia. You see, King George is giving us the land, so...
Y'know what? There's some nice guys at my office, do you want me to set you up?
It's your parents' anniversary and you're going to talk about their dead pet?
Nice camoflauge man, for a minute there I almost didn't see ya.
I'm not great at the advice, can I interest you in a sarcastic comment? Some cheese?
And the bunny got away.
All guys that are awake. Then we go to sleep and then all the guys from the other end of the world wake up and behave the exact same way.
How about Joey... Pepponi?
Fine! Maybe I will too!
So, you gotta play the odds, pick somebody who's gonna be in the country like all the time.
What's up Joe?
Hey, look, what do you want me to say? Do you want me to say that I'll stop seeing her?
So, you feel like goin' for a run?
Oh, really?
I don't think you can do that!
You got your passport?
Horrifying? Scarring? Something people go to jail for?
Hey.
Oh yea, your right. It's the second one.
What about it?
Not fun anymore?
Oh I see, I see, because of the third nipple thing. Ha ha ha ha. . .
Yeah! You?
Am I naked again?!
Half a tank? We still got a lot of high-speed chasing to do!
Nah, not so much. Alright, now we smoke. Oh.. my.. God.
Well, I don't see that we have a choice. But, when we're back home, we don't do it.
That's a lie, you went to the game, I can see Joey's hand.
Really? You're gonna be okay?
So, I finally catch up to her and she says this relationship is going to fast and we have to slow down.
Your work makes me sad.
It could be less than a year. I mean, you've heard my stuff. "Pants. Like shorts, but longer." It'll probably be more than a year.
I said, 'So I'm not gonna lose her?'
I'm serious, let me do something, just not the turkey or the stuffing, nothing "high profile".
Yeah, she couldn't live without the Chan Love.
Well hello!
But you found the keys to his clothes?
Petrie, right, right. Okay, some people gonna be working this weekend.
Shh! Nice to see you again.
Because that's the only part of you he can see when he's on the table!
Uhh, you've had a lot of sex right?
Well y'know a lot of those Muppets don't have thumbs.
Our adoption social worker is coming by today so we are cleaning the apartment.
Defend yourself.
Maybe that's because she's a minion of the anti-Christ.
All right, I'll pick that one.
I know it's tough now, but things will get better.
But kids are so intuitive. Don't you think on some level he already knows?
Ho-ho, so hard we had to throw out your underwear again?
Come on! Joe!
Still terrified, I'll take care of it. No problem.
I think that's the youngest girl ever to reject me.
Well, I-I guess I gotta go.
Okay.
Why?
What's an identical hand twin?
Well, at least we got these little guys out.
Now imagine you live at the supermarket.
A cool phone number, and a possible name for the kid.
Oh I'm so sorry man! Is there anything I can do?
Eh?
Do I ever.
That is true.
So explain something to me here, uh, what kind of a relationship do you imagine us having if you already have a husband and a boyfriend?
Not to shabby, I got this all off myself...using my wife's tools. Oh my God!
Things sure have changed here on Waltons mountain.
You know that thing, when you and I talk to each other about things?
You'll see, you guys are all gonna go off and get married, and I'm gonna end up alone. Will you promise me something? When you're married, will you invite me over for holidays?
Ben! Ben! Ben!
So tell me something, is leaving the Christmas lights up part of your plan to keep us merry all year long?
I don't think that's what they were talking about Joe!!
Were you there?
What?
That's awesome! That's great! What made you do it?!
I know that too.
Yeah, it's a very large plane.
Scared me out of ever wanting to live with him.
Oh, hello Rachel.
I'll take that.
Oh my God!
Y'know, if I won $5,000 I'd join a gym, y'know build up my upper body and hit Richard from behind with a stick!
Ohhh!!
Totally crazy stupid.
Dude, don't rub my face in your crazy single life!
Well, don't believe everything you hear, Ken. But yeah, that's true. Alright, let's get started, by take a look at last quarter's figures. Ah, Claudia, aren't you supposed to blow smoke up the bosses' ass?
We didn't play it!!
The man's got a point.
Hiya doin' pumpkin?
Listen, I have to, uh, um, I have to, I have to confess something.
You're welcome.
I did not say fat! I said, "Fa-aa-aw-ow..."
Hey!
That was so lame.
Yes, but the coffee table doesn't match the...blahebdmsdlkhdyslkd;btyds...Rooosss!!!!
I didn't know you read tea leaves.
Yeah y-you, how hard is it to say something? Rachel came over to borrow something.
But you already gave all your money to charity!
Hey listen, we've gotta go, I promised Richard we'd meet him downstairs.
You couldn't have at least changed your shirt.
Okay, so now do you believe that she's attracted to me?
Ok, I'm makin' a break for it, I'm goin' out the window.
No, I don't even think he knew. Hey, would you sleep with somebody to get a great job?
Say again?
Really?
I wouldn't know, I didn't make it!
What?
Oh, God.
And Joey.
You look good.
Hey.
That sounds more fun than the thing we were going to do in Vermont!
A little late for that.
Off?!!
I wouldn't read too much into it.
No. You decided to go into the out-of-work actor business. Now that wasn't easy, but you did it! And I'd like to believe that when the right woman comes along, you will have the courage and the guts to say "No thanks, I'm married."
Yeah, it's annoying, isn't it?
Yeah! You wanna come?
About what?
Why...why?
I got good. I played this game all day and now I rule at it! They should change the name of it to Ms. Chandler. Although I-I hope they don't.
Oh no, you'll have to come.
'Kay!
All right, but you can't use that again for a whole year. I'm in.
Be right there sweetums. A totally different situation.
Oh my God!! Is everybody getting married?!!
Let me see that.
When you're marrying us; that's what you should say.
That's what our friends call us.
Wow! I don't have the worst costume anymore!
What do you think Pheebs?
And monkeys can't write out prescriptions.
Oh Mon-Mon-Mon-Mon-look, this is the honeymoon suite. The room expects sex. The room would be disappointed if it didn't get sex. All of the other honeymoon suites would think it was a loser.
Right. So, it'll be the same except... less sex with you.
But, we'll stay here with you.
Hey!
I thought we weren't gonna have bachelor/bachelorette parties! Y'know, we agreed that it was a silly tradition.
You do know, I can just turn them the other way around, right?
Okay, so this time I won't quit!
What are you talking about?
Well, actually, yesterday I was smoking again. Today, I'm, I'm smoking still.
We have to assign heads to something.
No, it's suicide. The man's got an egg.
No-no all kids are embarrassed by their parents, you'd have to come up with a whole new word for what I went through. When I was in High School, he used to come to all of my swim meets dressed as a different Hollywood starlet. Y'know it's hard enough to be fourteen. You're skinny. You're wearing speedoes-That your mom promised that you would grow into! And you look up into the stands and there's your dad cheering you on dressed as Carmen Miranda. We was wearing a headdress with real fruit that he will later hand out to your friends as a healthy snack!
Eddie, I didn't sleep with your ex-girlfriend.
I don't do that.
Ok, so let me just get this straight. So we're uh, strictly talking about the middle?
Yes!
Eight and a half hours of aptitude tests, intelligence tests, personality tests... and what do I learn? "You are ideally suited for a career in data processing for a large multinational corporation."
Slim Pickings.
Hey, this isn't like swimming after you eat, pick up the phone!!
So she's a...
Then free as a bird. What's up?
Ha-ha-ha--enh-enh. I'm so glad you guys are all here! My office finally got wrinkle free fax paper!
It's my game. You want the job or not?
Hi, it's me.
Ohh that's the worse thing that can happen on an anniversary ever!
Clearly I did not start drinking enough at the start of the meal.
No I don't! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
They thought it was very smart of us to have a child write the recommendation letter.
No way!
And uh, you don't have a mustache which is good. I'm Chandler; I make jokes when I'm uncomfortable.
He paints quite a picture doesn't he?
Hey Phoebe! Fatty!
Look Ross, if you don't know them by now, you will never know them, okay? That is the beauty of this game. It makes you want to kill yourself.
A place where no one will ever get out alive?
This game makes no sense!
I do?
Y'know that thing that Ross was gonna do at our wedding?! He was hanging out with me yesterday and he turned to me and said, "You're half Scottish right?"
Uh, The Wheatsheaf.
Long!
If we do that, we gotta get Die Hard.
So? Would you care to join me in our first dance as husband and wife?
You'll have to pardon my roommate, he wanted to marry this.
I don't know, but don't worry, don't worry, because I know how to take a picture now. Okay, see? Look down , look down, look down...
Yeah, yeah, yeah! I want you... I need you... I must have you Janice Litman Goralnik Neihosenstein.
Okay.
Whoa-ho, back off, Missy!
What's in the bag?
Hey! How'd it go?
Thanks. What, let me have her?! What do mean? Like if you didn't I wouldn't have a shot?
Oh don't forget, my office holiday party is tonight.
Well, it's, it's yummy. So Mary-Angela do you like it?
Oh God, it freaked me out. Okay, I know it shouldn't have, but it did. I mean I like her, I don't want to stop seeing her, but every so often it's like 'Hey, y'know what, where's your leg?' I mean I'm the smallest person in the world aren't I? I'm the smallest person in the world.
Allright, fine, but don't blame me if it doesn't work. Because you know as well as I do that once Joey sets his mind on something, more often than not, he's going to have sex with it.
Sure, what's up?
There's this thing I really want us to do. I read about it in Maxim...
No stupid jokes. I thought that was for the actual wedding.
That's great!
What are you supporting?
Y'know what, pretty good.
Is there any chance you didn't see that?
The weirdest thing happened at the coffee house, I think, I think Phoebe was hitting on me.
Do we have to?
Y'know, sometimes that fake out thing is just mean!
Marcel?!
Oh come on!
Wow! Listen, we had a good run. You know, what was it? Four? Five months? I mean, that's more than most people have in a lifetime! So, good-bye, take care, bye-bye then!
Because the kids need new shoes.
Oh yeah, me too. Y'know if this shirt is dirty. Yep.
Wow, in 45 minutes you can find her twice.
Well, I heard that you thinking about asking Phoebe to move in with you and I thought maybe, we should have a talk. Man to uh, me.
Look at us, we're a couple of couples!
Well, I have a girlfriend, I'm-I'm happy. So, I no longer feel the need to go out of my way to stop others from being happy.
What are you looking at me for? I didn't know that.
RAT BASTARD!
Okay, don't say anything, you might scare it away.
No, I think we're just blurry shapes to him now.
I respectfully disagree.
So Joey breaks my chair and I get nothing!
Oh that's not bad, Pheebs?
Yes...Yes..Uh-huh, You? We did you.
What I do do...is manage to uh, create an atmosphere of support for the people working with me.
Who says you can't get a nice punch bowl for under six bucks? Maybe we can take it back?
So um, after you put the suggestion in the box, how long did it take for the roller skating thing to happen.
Oh, great. We have to watch him do yoga in his underwear, but for this he closes the drapes!
Hi honey I'm home.
Listen, if you want to borrow money, its kind of a bad time. I'm buying dinner for 128 people tomorrow night.
Really?
I'll hold you close in my arms. I can't resist your charms. And love....
Well we...we still hang out.
Hmm mmmhm..
Y'know, I don't see that happening?
A vending machine?
...betrothed couple.
Oh, well, ah... maybe thats because theyre ah... jealous, of us.
I can blow dry it. I can put gel on it. It doesn't matter, I still wind up with this little cowlicky thing on the middle part of my head. It's so annoying. Does it bug you?
Bye-bye.
Are you all right?!
Yeah, I heard you and Rachel talking.
Who's number two? One of the more difficult games sewer workers play.
Well, can I just...
You know when "That's fine" sounds true when someone yells it and spits!
Wow, you look...
OK, that's enough of the view. Check this out, look at this. Sit down, sit down.
It's not a big deal. It's, just it's right here, and it's all the time.
Yeah, but uh, it was 1982 and my flock of seagulls haircut was tickling her chin.
Okay, there are no famous Joey's. Except for, huh, Joey Buttafucco.
Yeah! If-if-if we did do this there would be a lot of pressure on me, y'know? Because you've been waiting a very long time and I wouldn't want to disappoint you.
Well that's not an, even a real fish. No, that's a goldfish cracker.
Me! I do that. So... Seriously, do I look okay? I'm little nervous.
Okay, well I'm gonna get Ross, get the cameras, and get them developed. 32 Joe. You're 32!
Y'know? So I was thinking that we could get one of those signs and hang it over our bed. Because, that's you and I together! Merge!
I am sorry, Ross.
Hey-hey, is Monica here?
And I am not blah, I am a hoot!
No!! You can't!!
So I laugh at my boss's jokes, what's the big deal?
...little playthings with yarn?
Where I don't want to have a relationship ever! I just want to have sex with strippers and my friends!!
...and a street where our kids can ride their bikes and maybe an ice-cream truck can go by.
You forbid me?
What about that circled one?
Couldn't be more out.
Oh God. It's shovely-Joe, isn't it?
No thanks, Josephine.
What must it be like not to be crippled by fear and self-loathing.
Nice going, imp. OK, it's OK. All I need to do is reach over and put it in my mouth.
Why?
You don't think I've tried? You think I like having 50 dollars taken out of my bank account every month? No, they make you go all the way down there! Then they use all of these phrases and peppiness to try and confuse you! Then they bring out Maria.
All right, there's a nuclear holocaust, I'm the last man on Earth. Would you go out with me?
So we're standing firm on the 'not getting our hopes up'?
Hello.
Girth? Why, why, why, wh-why, why, why, why would they do this?
No no no! Look, Carol, can I call you Carol? Wh-why would I when your name is Elaine? Oh what a great picture of your son, strapping! That's a picture of your daughter, isn't it, well she's lovely. I like a girl with a strong jaw. I'll call you from Tulsa.
What?
Bob here.
Oh, umm, Joey was born, and then 28 years later, I was robbed!!
Well maybe you don't have to tell him anything.
Hey, it's me.
What happened? I'm just eating candy.
You've got it.
Blue blazer back. He-he wants it back.
I am totally picturing you with all those women!
Okay.
Aww, thanks man.
Of course, of course not. I just have to uh, go over to the place where I-I made it and pick-pick it up.
oh it was great.
Oh, y'know, what did you mean when you said pivot?
When you go lunching with hunky moustache men and don't tell me about it!
There you go! Someone came!
Your Veal Chop is $34,95!
Yes! And look, now that I know if I got some extra stuff lying around can we, can we share the closet.
Hey, there's two messages. These could be from work!
Why not, just because his great-grandmother was obese, our kids are gonna get that from you anyway!
Well y'know, what if she didn't actually sleep with the guy?
I did! A penis one! Look, just so I know, what was so wrong about what I said?
Does Ross know?
Whoa, she's pretty.
Yes, please don't spoil all this fun.
Tell me what?
Oh, believe me, to survive this party, you're gonna have to come up with one too.
M-Me-me-me!
Maybe she didn't move on, you know...maybe that kiss was just an impulsive one-time birthday thing.
I sent them home.
I think you should go back with Gary. I don't wanna be the guy that breaks up a family, y'know when my parents split up, it was because of that guy. Whenever I would see him I was always think y'know 'You're the reason, you are the reason why their not together.' and I hated that guy. And it didn't matter how nice he was, or how happy he made my Dad.
Well, why don't you check in one of my saddlebags while I chew on a bale of hay!
It's up to you.
Yeah!
Bye!
...Well, y'know, part of me wants that, but it's like I'm two guys, y'know? I mean, one guy's going 'Shut up! This is great!' But there's this other guy. Actually it's the same guy that wells up every time that Grinch's heart grows three sizes and breaks that measuring device... And he's saying, y'know, 'This is too hard! Get out! Get out!'
I'm sorry buddy, but I don't think I'm gonna be able to make it.
No, no, no.
Yeah. O-okay.
What? May I?
I know you probably don't want to go out with me, y'know because I make too many jokes and I've never been in a serious relationship and I guess I'm not technically a "doctor..."
Don't judge me, I'm only human!
This is the way that I find out. Most moms use the phone.
Should we call the spitter?
No, 'Slim Pickings', it's a barbecue restaurant. They're looking for a cook. Actually 'cook' may be a bit of a stretch. They're looking for someone to shovel mesquite.
What?
I had about a mugful in this lovely 'I got boned at the Museum of Natural History' mug.
Hello? It's Nancy, they responded to our offer.
Hey.
Why?! What happened?!
I'll teach ya! Come on, come on, it's really easy and really, really fun.
Oh! Right. Umm, maybe that's because I didn't send him an invitation.
Is that your new walk?
Okay, look, I'm gonna pull on the door and you guys push as hard as you can. Maybe we can get enough room to wiggle him out, okay? Okay, so PUSH!
Hello, Joanna......'s office.
Fine with me.
I can't believe the guys missed this.
What are you guys doing?
It's okay, the duck's using our bathroom anyway. Hey Joe! What are you getting Kathy for her birthday?
How about to the street say from the balcony?
You're kidding, no!
Oooh that may be a New World's record
All right, check out this bad boy. 12 megabytes of ram. 500 megabyte hard drive. Built-in spreadsheet capabilities and a modem that transmits at over 28,000 b.p.s.
Why? Wh- wh- why is Mr. Douglas looking for me?
All right. Look, I'm gonna go in here, and you don't buy me anything ever.
Yes, the moon, the glow, the magical feeling, you did this part- Could I get some painkillers over here, please?
Thanks.
You don't?
Don't say Richard! Well, if they're not Monica's and they're not yours, then whose are they?
So I'm not, not gonna lose her?
I know, let's rest and drink lots of fluids.
It is going to be perfect. I am taking her to her favorite restaurant. I'm going to get her a bottle of the champagne that she really loves; therefore knows how expensive it is. Then when the glasses are full, instead of proposing a toast I'm just gonna propose.
No-no
So, uh, wh-where ya from?
Like finding money with naked people on it!
Open up! Open up! Open up!
Ahh, you know what? That is....Who wouldn't want you?
That.
This is about you and Richard. He's clearly not over you. He keeps a tape so he can... look at it whenever he wants.
Let me ask you, do you have to be Carol's lesbian life partner?
Who said anything about Christmas?
No. No, not at all, that's-that's ridiculous.
So great things are happening at work and in your personal life!
It's throwing and catching!
Yeah?
Yes dear.
Do you have my credit card?
Are you okay? I'm so sorry, he wouldn't leave. He kept asking me about chicken.
You-you-you didn't know that. Well, I guess my work here is done!
I do not hate Ross!
I know, me too. Hey! Y'know what if we went away for a whole weekend? Y'know we'd have no interruptions and we could be naked the entire time.
You're not?
Here's the thing, Janice. You know, I mean, it's like we're different. I'm like the bing, bing, bing. You're like the boom, boom, ... boom.
Here we go, here we go.
Okay, what is in here? Rocks?
Software that facilitates inter-business networking e-solutions?
Y'know, I was hoping for a little more enthusiasm.
It's a sock bunny.
Hey, Lowell.
Then...who did?
When we were?
Joey, be a pal. Lift up my hand and smack her with it.
Okay to come in?
Yeah, not bad right? You know what, Monica's gonna be working late, so I'm gonna make this place spotless. You know what else I'm gonna do, know what else I'm gonna do? I'm gonna go downstairs, I'm gonna get her some flowers. Now who wouldn't wanna live with me?
I don't know if I've told you this, but he's kinda tried to get in contact with me a lot over the last few years
Bad dream?
Hey! Hi! You uh, ready to exchange gifts?
You're a genius!
Yeah, well, you're wrong! Okay, you're wrong.
No, I don't want to tell anybody else because I don't want Monica to find out.
Okay. Well, I think the centerpieces are too big
Don't go! I'm sorry. I'm so sorry! Look! This guy fell asleep! He fell asleep too! Be mad at him! Or, call an ambulance.
Hey.
He's doing that weird eye contact thing. Don't look at him, don't look at him!
Hey-hey!
Okay, two, three years of rent, utilities, food...
Who's the bitterest man in the living room, the bitterest man in the living room? Hi, neighbor.
Fresh!
Bored and bored!
Thanks, Phoebe. But I just don't really see myself in a big white hat.
Stop talkin' to your men.
But uh Ross, Ross is a great guy! I was roommates with him in college. Uh, funny story... You're roommate in college died didn't he?
Scared? Happy?
Stick to your side!
Oh, don't say that! Don't say that. That's not true. Is it?
Oh yeah, Dana Keystone. She was in my Movement class.
Kinda... you know, sneaking around, having to hide from you guys...
Yeah, Ross is here so...
Or we can do the actual telephone thing.
Oh, Danielle! I wasn't expecting the machine... Give me a call when you get a chance. Bye-bye. Oh God!
Hey, Ross, I just wanted to apologize... ..don't tell me you actually made those gay pictures of me?
Okay!
Yeah, I guess it's a little better now.
Fine. Oh no!
Just tell her the truth! Tell her you're not ready.
Look, it's my wedding day okay? If you were getting married I would never do anything to upset you.
Why?
Y'know what? I-I kinda have.
Of course, I didn't get to enjoy any of that, because Joanna's such a big, dull dud!
You know, I flew a long way t see my loving wife? Is she here by the way?
I know. See, yes. That's Yasmine Bleeth, she's a completely different kind of chick. I love you both. But in very different ways.
And you're upset because you didn't make your best friend cry?
I'd like to toast, Ross and Emily. Of course, my big toast will be tomorrow at the wedding, so this is kind of my little toast or Melba toast, if you will. Okay. I known Ross for a long time. In fact, I knew him when he was going out with his first girlfriend. And I thought things were going to work out for him.. Until the day he over inflated her. Ohh, Dear God..
Okay, okay, so we get to take that stupid troll thing home!
Is Monica not here?
I don't know what to say. I'm sorry that we make more money than you. But we're not gonna feel guilty about it. We work really hard for it.
No, I just always see guys doing this when they get handcuffs taken off them. Hello sweet pants!
No, I prefer to keep a safe distance from all this merriment.
Mint!
Hi, Paul, is it?
I'd like to go up the ladder of chance to the golden mud hut please.
Please let me stay on this side of the door.
Joey and I can finish up in the guest room.
Right.
Merry Christmas, you guys!
Please, just do it!
Ah, it's just a weekend, big deal!
You don't, like go into the back of my closet, and look under my gym bag or anything?
It still doesn't work.
Oh, yeah, easy for you to say, you don't have to walk around sporting some reject from the Mr. T collection.
We were playing Gin? Y'know if we were a couple, we could play this game naked.
I always knew you were gonna make it. I'm so proud of you.
Man, we're gonna rock that Asian student union!
That would be no. Look, just because you played tonsil tennis with my mom doesn't mean you know her. Alright? Trust me, you can't talk to her.
I see.
Whoa-whoa-whoa, what are we going to do about my job?
She's just doing her job!
Are you hugging the door right now.
That's just a lot of big talk, y'know.
Yes. Vividly.
I thought...maybe...you got me porn for Valentine's Day.
Wh-wh-why, wh-why, why, why was there kissing!? There should be no kissing!!
I'm smoking. I'm smoking, I'm smoking.
Yeah.
We have to leave for New York in an hour.
Tell her, I'm allergic, and I will sue!
See buddy, that's all you need, a bunch of toothless guys hitting each other with sticks.
Ok.
Great, at a hundred dollars an apple, we're there!
Listen, I gotta talk to you.
Because she's not eleven! And it's not the seventh night of Hanukkah!
Yeah, I'll go get one.
Yeah?
This is nuts. This is crazy. She came over for like two minutes, dropped off a fish tank, and left, end of story.
Well, what did you think, that-that elves came in and fixed it?
Allright, I'm gonna watch it... I mean look, it's probably not even what I think it is... And even if it is... It can't possibly be as bad as what I'm picturing in my head... Can it?
Well, I guess thats why they call it psychology, sir.
Oh, y'know I-I can't hear that enough.
Okay! Okay! Let me try it again, you're gonna wanna date this next guy, I swear!
I was asleep. Oh no! No-no honey! Y'know what's sexy? Layers. Layers are sexy. And blankets are sexy. And oh! Hot water bottles are sexy.
Wow! Aren't you gonna be cold?
Oh yes, yes, we could play some other game... like, uh, I don't know... Pictionary?
Ahhhh-gaaaahhh. Eddie what're you still doin' here?
Well now you have two. Hey, I am good at math.
The actor playing Mac couldn't do it, they needed to see you at 2 o'clock.
An old cookie?
Yeah, you almost overreacted to something.
We'll watch him.
Honey, the tortilla chips know what you mean.
The sheer volume, it was like flying with the Riddler!
Yeah. I feel so bad. Is there anything I can do to make it up to you?
Can't believe you guys bought that, enjoy your slow death .
Good! I haven't smoked yet today, I feel great, and-and-and confident, that is a stunning blouse.
OH MY GOD!!!
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA......AAAaaa-doption!!
No, I have a great idea for a present for her.
Go on.
Just practicing. You're good. Carry on.
Make sure you put all that stuff back in the closet, okay?
Yeah, well... Y'know, it just got me thinking though, why would anybody ever want to get married huh?
Please, one ridiculous problem at a time!
I'd like to propose a toast. Little toast here, ding ding. I know this isn't the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting. Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know? So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.
Hey.
What's going on?
Well is she...
Yeah, well, don't expect that to happen anytime soon!
I'm not a dropper!
Hey!
I don't know. That's the thing. I don't know what I want to do. I just know I'm not going to figure it out working there.
Janice?!
She's not gonna make you wear one of those big plastic cones, is she?
See, you think it's just a pen, but then you turn it over and it's also a clock.
So in your whole life, you've only been with one oh.
Okay.
Ok, how about this ?
Yeah, I've always hated that Howie.
You mean like for award shows?
The bath salts! They're starting to effervesce! It's different. It's interesting.
You know what just occurred to me? This could be our last Thanksgiving just the two of us. I mean, we could be getting a baby soon!
Oh no-no-no, Monica would freak. But to hell with that bitch.
You know, we don't really take advantage of living in the city.
Because he was looking at her differently.
There he is!
Here just...take this.
I know it. You know, I'm totally gonna ask her out.
Um, absolutely. Uh, how 'bout tomorrow afternoon? Do you know uh, Central Perk in the Village, say, five-ish?
You want some help.
New York is awesome!
No, no! We made this decision together.
Okay, well. Janice said 'Hi, do I look fat today?' And I, I looked at her....
Leave it.
So, ah... Any plans for the summer?
And I just realized I can sleep with my eyes open.
What?!
Umm, so this Aunt Marilyn is-is-is-is she coming to the wedding?
What are you talking about? We love Schhteve! Schhteve was schhexy!.. Sorry.
Uhhuh, how did you know that?
Your cappucino sir.
Fancy guest.
Really? Like you have a routine?
Oh, so you're going with the teacher, huh?
This isn't one of those uh, y'know "If she doesn't come, we-we don't, we don't come?" Right? Because I already bought my ticket...
Get out. Get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out.
Yeah, baby!
Sure...
Hey, you guys in the living room all know what you want to do. You know, you have goals. You have dreams. I don't have a dream.
You wanna see flirting? I'll show you flirting.
Wow! Pregnancy does give you some weird cravings.
I want you out.
See? Intuitive!
Well, what? What? What is it? That she left you? That she likes women? That she left you for another woman that likes women?
That really was an incredible wedding.
Yea yea.
I... thought it was a timely start to thinking about other people. Besides, this gift still says I love you guys.
Hey, woah, hey, woah.
Thank you, Ross.
You know, once youre inside, you dont have to knock any more.
Okay, bye, champ. Now, I know there's gonna be a lot of babes in San Diego, but remember, there's also a lot to learn.
It's very, very nice. Well, come here. I'm very were gonna be having all the sex.
Now all you have to do is just get through a little bit more, okay? Then we can put you in bed, okay? Just smile and don't talk to anyone.
Yeah, I'll sit down.
I got that!
Hey.
Yeah, it kinda makes that-that one night special. Y'know, technically we still are over international waters.
I'm sorry, it was a one-time-thing. I was very drunk and i was somebody else's subconscious.
Not it! Damn it!
Well yeah, in that it's not being used and I... have it to spare.
How do you figure that?
I've found.
I'm not freaking out. Why would I be freaking out? A woman named Heldi called and said we were getting married, but that happens everyday.
Monica.
Yes that would have made more sense.
Mr. D, hows it going, sir?
May I help you?
What?!
You're not gonna need my help?
Hi Monica.
Wait! Wait! We'd really love it if you could be there.
Oh well you're the best. You come here to me.
I never stopped loving you.
So then I guess Ferdinad is out.
That's so funny, because I think I just did!
We don't know what could make this go away.
You obviously haven't tasted my Palmolive potatoes!
I know.
Oh, what the hell is that?
Janice! There you are! There you are! I had to have one last kiss, and also-also you said that you were going to leave right after I got on the plane!
I'm sor... Just go. Just go. I can't, I can't.
It's okay, I got a plan.
So, who does?
Interesting! Can I see you for a second?
My duties? All right.
And they don't like it when you explain why your jokes are funny.
Hey, yeah... we could all sleep together and then one of us could get amnesia.
Our guy has great hair.
Oh yeah, that's very nice. Plus, y'know they were free and they're too small.
More importantly, was I any good?
Oh, no I don't.
I don't know. It's a bracelet.
They're in my bag over there.
Mar-haaaan.
Because it's complicated, it's complex- Hey, you kissed my mom!
What?!
Thanks.
So will I.
Do you know why?
Hey, you know who used to have nails like that?
Fine!
Okay.
Yes, 98.6. You're gonna be fine.
Yes.
Is anybody else scared?
Why don't you go up on stage. I'll get a picture of you doing the speech.
You didn't just break up.
Yes, hitting her with a frying pan's a good idea. We might wanna have a backup plan, though, just in case she isn't a cartoon.
Phoebe!
Here you go. Now stop bringing us pizzas you.
Alright, OK, alright. But if we put on spandex and my boobs are bigger than yours, I'm goin' home.
Hey!
Yeah we do!
Are you serious?!
Sounds like a really bad idea to me.
No Joey! No Joey! Don't Joey! Joey!
Dude, it's Chandler. Let me in.
It was a car backfire!
Hey! Hey, hey-hey, hey.
Do you want me to call?
Hey, there he is! There he is!
Yeah, I guess.
Oh hey! There's some kids playing in the street, you wanna go down there and give them a project, ruin their day?
Yeah, either that, or Gloria Estefan was right, eventually, the rhythm is going to get you.
Yeah! Why don't you stick around. You can sit right there.
ah-ha!
Sounds like a date to me.
Bye-bye little puppet Joey hand?
I can't believe you did this.
well, well, well it must be five in Tulsa because it's six o clock IN NY.C!
What's this?
What kind of scary-ass clowns came to your birthday?
Nothing happened? Nothing? So you didn't tell my girlfriend that you love her?
Hey, shut up!! You're not my real Mom!!
You wouldn't know if Jeanette's planning on keeping her baby, would ya?
Phoebe knows about us!
Yeah, just think of it as $25 per room!
Well, then, I might as well offer to stay.
Yeah, you-you gotta love the talking.
Thank you Rachel.
Well see now that I can see crying over, but Bambi is a cartoon!
I can't figure out what to make Monica.
So they're going on dates? When?
YEAH!!! YES!!!
Because he's crazy. Okay? He came up to me earlier and thanked me for my very moving performance in Titanic.
Honey, it's gonna be okay.
Do you think you could get through a poem?
Nice try.
It happened in London.
Yes! Chandler Bing, 7! Chandler Bing, 0.
That's a pig.
Tuna or egg salad? Decide!
It's the Miracle Wax.
Oh dear God!
Y'know I was thinking, what if I uh, unpack here?
Okay.
I'd just like to say that I'm totally behind this experiment. In fact, I'd very much like to butter your head.
Okay, 'cause that's not gonna get annoying.
She's right, it's Jill. Jill Goodacre. Oh my God. I am trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre! Is it a vestibule? Maybe it's an atrium. Oh, yeah, that is the part to focus on, you idiot!
Monica, can I talk to you for a sec?
YOU NEVER DID IT!
Really?! I-I thought you weren't looking for something serious? I thought you were looking for some kind of a fling.
And now I've picked it up again.
All right.
Yeah, he let us drive his Jaguar. Joey for 12 blocks, me for 15.
You're damn right I'm right. I say you show this guy what you're made of. I say you stand your ground. I say you show him that you are the baddest hombre west of the lingerie.
It means that we can keep trying, but there's a good chance this may never happen for us.
That sounds good. I'll call you- or you call me, whatever...
Yeah, I'm not so worried.
Yeah I know, guess who beeped him?
Stop what?!
Hey!
That's perfect! That's brilliant!
Ohhh. Don't go.
Oh yeah, yeah! Look what I got, look what I got. See, she's fully dressed, right?
I don't, and I'm offended by the insinuation!
I don't want him to tell this story for years.
Nah, Phoebs, that's the guy that comes in the frame.
You have done enough!
Buy stamps, pick up dry cleaning...Don't let Phoebe in.
All right, say you do that. You know sooner or later somebody's gonna come along that slices a better cheddar. And then where're you gonna run?
Hello? Hello?
Would you give me one minute!! Please.
Well, only if you order stuff.
Well apparently Albert has no friends. He's very excited about the bachelor party though. I think actually the only reason he's getting married is so he can see a stripper.
Hhhiiii.
So you risked your life, for a sandwich!
She was kidding.
Marry her.
That's good! I liked it, they didn't. Joey, for God's sake, go to work! .
I've had a very long, hard day.
Forget it, that's off.
You're definitely scaring here.
Well, stuff like where'd we live, y'know? Like a small place outside the city, where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff. Y'know, we could have a cat that had a bell on it's collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door. Of course, we'd have an apartment over the garage where Joey could grow old.
Marry me.
Now that I untangled you, how 'bout you doing a little something for me?
So umm, you-you flirt with guys all the time?
They're not even paying ya! This doesn't even sound like a real movie!
I'm off the list.
Hmm.
Well, this is fascinating. So, uh, what is it about me?
And, a lemon lime.
I know. You're right. I want to see you too. I've just got to figure out a way to tell Joey, you know? He's really looking forward to this.
Alright, whoever this is, stop calling me! It's been six months! It's not funny!
It doesn't matter because nothing beats a three and a six. That my friend is D-Cup. Okay, now much have you won so far?
We could trade later.
At this?!
Oh no nonononononnononono, don't go..
Forget about her.
What are you, stop naming dwarves! Hello, Janice. Hi, I'm so glad that you called, I know I've been acting a really weird lately. And, it's just because I'm crazy about you, and I just got...stupid, and, and scared, and....stupid a couple of more times. I'm sorry. Really?! Really?!
I'm sorry. You're not easy-going, but you're passionate, and that's good. And when you get upset about the little things, I think that I'm pretty good about making you feel better about that. And that's good too. So, they can say that you're high maintenance, but it's okay, because I like ... maintaining you.
That's a good idea, 'Dear Janice have a Hubba-Bubba birthday'. I would like to get her something serious.
And! They like me more just because I was with ya! I think you repaired a lot of the damage from when they met Joey. And Doug wants us to play tennis with them. He's never even talked to me outside of work. Except for that time when we bumped into each other at that strip club. Strip church. Anyway, I'm gonna go try and find a racquet.
Okay, so he's out of here.
Oh, yeah.
Young! You're a man-child okay?! Now go get changed because everybody's ready and please, oh please, keep my underwear!
I'm totally screwed. Okay, they are gonna be hot and heavy on stage every night, and then they're gonna go to their cast parties and he's gonna try to undermine me. Y'know it'll be like, "So where's your boyfriend, what's-his-name, Chester?" And she'll go, "No-no-no, it's Chandler." And he'll go, "Whatever. Ha-ha-ha-ha!"
Nothing! I said, I said "You're so great" and then I just, I just stopped talking!
Well, yeah... 's'no Brian in Payroll.
Oh hey Rachel, sweetheart? You have got to tell the post office that you have moved. Okay? We are still getting all your bills and stuff.
Oh no problem, maybe I'll play with my left hand.
That's a plane!
Okay! Okay! Okay! I'll do it! Oh God, I thought... Wait a minute, I-I can do this. I thought that it mattered what I said or where I said it. Then I realized the only thing that matters is that you, you make me happier than I ever thought I could be. And if you'll let me, I will spend the rest of my life trying to make you feel the same way. Monica, will you marry me?
Hey!
What? There was ice there that night with Carol? Plastic seats? Four thousand angry Pittsburgh fans?
Well let's see, there was the guy with the ferrets, that's plural. The spitter. Oh-ho, and yes, the guy that enjoyed my name so much he felt the need to make a little noise every time he said it. Nice to meet you, Chandler Bing Bing! Great apartment Chandler Bing, Bing!
I'm in the bathtub.
Look, Joey, Kathy is clearly not fulfilling your emotional needs. But Casey, I mean granted I only saw the back of her head, but I got this sense that she's-she's smart, and funny, and gets you.
That is lucky.
No-no, I don't think you heard me. Are you ready to party?!
Why are you wearing my apron?
Hello-dillillio!!
I'm sorry man.
Why do they put so much steam in there?!
Okay, worst case scenario. Say you never feel like a father.
And no kissing your neck.
Hey.
You have gotta stop!
OH MY GOD! When you came in I switched the channel, I was just watching regular porn.
How long you been waitin' to say that?
Okay.
Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas!
How about those three pointers?
No, I know, but it's just so hard, you know? I mean, you're sitting there with her, she has no idea what's happening, and then you finally get up the courage to do it, and there's the horrible awkward moment when you've handed her the note.
Why!?
Today is the sixth.
...I'm, I'm okay.
So, uh, how often can you do it?
It's gonna be okay, right? I mean she's not gonna leave me? This is, this is fixable.
No-no-no-no. Hey!
You tell me! Maybe, it's because I was just fooling with my ex! Oh no-no-no-no, no-no-no-no, that was you!!
Yeah, we're gonna need to see that tape.
He was asking all these questions about you, me, and London. And, of course the glue that holds this all together, the rules.
I don't know R.G., I was thinking something girlie for your office.
Yeah, we are so sorry.
Yes, but, Ross you chose a career of talking about dinosaurs.
Phoebe Buffay In Buffay The Vampire Layer.
Yeah! I've never been in a relationship that's lasted this long before. Y'know to get past the beginning and still be around each other all the time, I think that's pretty incredible. And the fact that this is happening all with you, yeah I think that's pretty exciting.
But hey, it's courtside. The cheerleaders are going to be right in fr. . . That's not the way to convince you.
Wow! Really?! We get all this rusty crap for free?!
Multiple, so many paper cuts.
All right. I thought about it and maybe you're right. Maybe Krog is not a safe toy.
Really, bitchin'!
Hey, look, we're on that TV thing!
So, basically just a Chinese guy.
I mean, I can write slogans. I mean, how hard can it be, right? "Cheese. It's milk that you chew." "Crackers. Because your cheese needs a buddy." "A grape. Because who can get a water melon in your mouth?"
Bye. I can't stand the woman!
Yeah, well I went to boarding school with four hundred boys. Any sex I had would've involved a major lifestyle choice.
You look beautiful. Is this new?
What?
I didn't mean that. I just meant that the apartment is worth so much more.
Uh honey, I know you don't like to relinquish control...
I never want to leave you again!
But I just wa...
Well, then it looks like somebody is gonna have to give back somebody his cushions.
Hey!
We're very happy for you.
Oh no, now it's not gonna make any sense!
Yeah, all right, I'll play.
It hurts me. It physically hurts me.
Yeah, for about 30 minutes.
You or me?
Rachel, I love you! Deal with me first!
Alright alright, we still have three hours till escrow closes on our house. We can still get out.
Yes. Okay, there's this one guy, Patrick, I think you're gonna like him, he's really nice, he's funny, he's a swimmer.
But we had one of the greatest talks we ever had last night. I mean it was, it was like when we first started living together.
I'm trppd... in an ATM vstbl... wth Jll Gdcr!
Easy tiger.
But you come first!
So how's Mindy?
Hey!
You already know.
Well, I'm sorry if my friends aren't as sophisticated as yours.
But nothing has to happen until your ready.
Okay.
Me too...
I just feel awful.
Listen, I'm really glad you got the part.
Joey... Switzerland?
Two.
God, it's great to catch up! I can't believe how long it's been!
Lie!!! How hard is that?! The check's in the mail! Oh your baby is so cute! I can't wait to read your book Ross!!
Yeah. Oh it's not warm yet, we still have time.
Okay. I can't believe tomorrow's the big day.
Uhh, that was Joey. He's running a little late, he says he's sorry.
Oh, it's okay. I don't...
Okay.
I noticed you were enjoying that Ravioli with a beautiful set of teeth. Did you have braces as a child?
Yeah, if that was true, gym class would've been a lot more interesting.
Because we don't do that. We are Bings! And if there's one thing my father taught me was... well to always knock before going into the pool house... but the other thing was never borrow money.
I thought you were gonna be gone all day.
I-no! I didn't read the box before I opened it. And you can't return a box after you've opened the box.
Okay. So uh, Ross is kinda bummed huh?
Maybe 'cause the last one was made by Pepperidge Farm. Look Eddie, isn't there something else you're supposed to be doing right now?
Alright look Ross I'll give you 50 dollars for your underpants.
You know, I think I might just.
But we are not the one she chose! How can you feel okay about this?
Is this really your long term plan, for me to run interference? Because I could get a job any day now.
I also said, "Yes!"
Oh uh, o, OK.
Yeah, but Sebastian? What is that? A cat's name?
Oh! That's great, they haven't seen the place since I moved in!
Why can't I tell them that we live together?
What?
I talked to Janice.
Bye..... ridiculously dull Bobby.
What is so funny about that?
So where are you applying to?
We've been driving for a half-hour, and you haven't looked at the road once.
You're on!
Yeah. Either that, or you just turned him on and sent him off to a stripper.
Hey, y'know what? I was wrong.
Hey, you cry every time somebody talks about Titanic!
Humiliating and noble!
Should we tell Rachel there's an empty private room right next door to hers?
You don't like that show?
Yeah, I can say that I have a conference and you can say you have a chef thing.
Oh, okay.
The reason we haven't told them we're together is because they hate me, okay? So will you fix this?
Oh, I can't believe my sperm have low motility because, let me tell you, when I was growing up they sure seem to be in a hurry to get places!!
Hey!
You did.
Hey, look, Phoebe I wanted to meet her in person too, okay, but she's married, she has a husband.
Actually, we already found a house we love.
Oh that's great, with my luck, that's gonna be him.
Your little men are gonna get scored on more times than your sister.
Yes.
I got caught up and work, but I'm quitting tomorrow.
Well you should meet my uncle, Bada. I'll let myself out.
Well, maybe I won't kiss you, and then you'll have to stay.
Hey, y'know what you should do? You should take her back to the 1890's, when that phrase was last used.
I know I am.
So how'd it go?
What is with him?
Sure, everybody loves a kidder.
No, the doctors say it may kill her.
Nono, just you.
Yes, yes I actually saw him leave. I mean that guy is standing in the window holding a human head. He is STANDING IN THE WINDOW HOLDING A HUMAN HEAD!
Yeah!
Look, she's really nice. Okay? And she mentioned that she adored the way that you arranged the sponges.
Like, when you're cooking a steak.
Hi!
That's not funny.
Remember that big party? Freshman year? A week before Christmas vacation? I do. You had some visitors.
As in Barbara Streisand's husband James Brolin?
Alright.
Well it's just my entire family was run out of Scotland by...Vikings. Anyway, lots of bad memories.
All this lying has been hard on us too.
No, it was me. I'm sorry. I over reacted.
I can't believe she's married.
Hey, check out that girl! She is really hot!
But I think we should tell her.
No.
Hey!
Look, don't you see what's happening here. Instead of hitting on her right away, he's becoming her confidant. Now he's gonna be the guy she goes too to complain about you.
Well we could just stay in and cook for ourselves.
What do you think she's just gonna sit there quietly? You don't think she's gonna want to make a toast? You don't think she's gonna want to grab the microphone and sing Part-time Lover?!
Yeah, I mean we've got a lot going on right now. And, plus, here they'd have their own room.
Okay, so this isn't a picture of our first, but it is a picture of my first kiss with...with this lady. Which by the look on your face I'm sure you'll remember. So we don't need--There's no need to have this picture. How about I take the real pictures and get them developed right now.
Hey!
It's exactly like it sounds.
Hi honey I'm home!
Bye.
Did she go out with him?
All right, but I should warn you, I'm not going. I'm going.
She doesn't know. Says she loves us both. Y'know I woke up this morning and I was in love, well I was happy. Y'know it serves me right for buying that twelve pack of condoms. And now I can't even return them, because she choked on the reciept!
Okay!
I'm sorry, I thought you were Joey's other grandmother. I've done it again.
Forget it! Okay, I'm not giving up the apartment.
Ooh, not so tight... I'm sorry, just give me one more chance.
I was not flirting.
He's the headliner of a gay burlesque show.
Oh, you're-you're going?
Ohh, great, I have condom in my wallet I've had since I was twelve.
It's-it's about Kathy. Umm, uh, I like her. I like her a lot actually.
Monica has a secret closet and she won't let me see what's in it.
They're out there!
I don't think of her that way, you know, she's a, she's a colleague.
Oh, nononowaitwaitwaitnono! Uh... we may not know anything about radiators per se, but we do have a certain amount of expertise in the heating and cooling... mileu.
Good to know.
I think we've found our sperm!
Yes, we do. But, we have to change first.
Because of the weekend, we had a fight.
Yeah?
That's why I lost my toe?! Because I called you fat?!
Because that's who I am, okay? I'm sure a mature man like Richard could see a tape like that and it wouldn't bother him. Just'd be another saucy anecdote for him to share at his men's club over brandy and moustaches.
All right fine! But I'm only doing this for you!
All right, so that's Missy Goldberg, Phoebe Cates and Molly Ringwald, who neither of us can go out with.
Uuuh.
Don't take this personally okay? It's just that I just can't have sex with a sick person.
Oh, yeah! Absolutely! Anything you need man! But you have to promise me the second you are feeling better so that we can make fun of your hair!
Three!
Uh, yes, yes it is.
I say we go with Careless Whisper.
Somewhere there is someone with a tranquilizer gun and a huge butterfly net looking for that man.
Yeah, it's like when you're a kid, and your parents put your dog to sleep, and they tell you it went off to live on some farm.
Of course it was!
Thanks, I'm glad you see it that way.
Okay, I have news. You don't have to move to Tulsa. You can stay here and keep your job.
The cold weather hurts my hip!
I feel violated. And not in a good way.
Really!
I know! You ready to trade?
You know that's not the reason Joe.
Almost as good as that play with the two naked girls on the see-saw.
Hi, Joe.
Okay, Pheebs, we decided the picnic idea was a little... Y'know, it didn't have any... It-it, well it blew. So, we thought, that this afternoon that we would all go away for the whole weekend to, Atlantic City!
I am so much older than these other interns. I can't compete with them.
Yeah, we really missed you guys.
Hey! How was lunch?
I know about Monica.
Oh, Ross, when you make out card; be sure to make it out to, EM-I-LY.
Yes, but for the last time.
Oh, beautiful? Really? Beautiful? You think this is beautiful?
You made pottery?
Uh, Julie.
Our guy smells incredible.
Oh, come on. What was with that whole Black Bart speech? : "When I play poker, I'm not a nice guy!"
I think they get it.
Tonight?! Isn't an engagement ring supposed to have a diamond? Oh, there it is!
Okay, good-bye. Good-bye.
Y'know I had a big meal on Monday, y'know. So that's just gonna get me straight through the week.
Okay, I get it. So, I get nothing! Nothing here is mine! Everything here is yours! I'll get up in the morning put on your clothes, and head off to work!
It's a traditional Mexican custard dessert...Look talk to Monica, she's on the food committee.
AND TO ALL A GOOD NIGHT! *Opening Credits*
Woah, woah, woah. I don't need a roommate either, OK? I can afford to live here by myself. Ya know, I may have to bring in somebody once a week to lick the silverware.
What about the birds?
You're gonna be great.
I know.
Can you see my nipples through this shirt?
Hey.
Not bad.
Well, my Grandfather was Swedish and my Grandmother was actually a tiny little bunny.
Look, I'm sorry I didn't give them your tape. And I promise, next time to submit you whether I think you are right for the part or not.
Okay, ten bucks says that we can name every item in that bag.
If I'm goin' down, I'm takin' everybody with me.
Ahh, do you have any coconut flavoured deities?
Right, I mean, come on, I'm sure that if you had a funeral or a memorial service, tons of people would come.
Ah, well no, it's just uh, me and Wendy.
So she was just pretending to have a good time last night? She was lying to our faces?!
No. Not anymore.
There's a tape here with Monica's name on it.
I'm sure it's somebody for you. Now, go hide.
Guess who's back in show business.
I figured I'd buy those. Pat, I'd like to buy a vow.
I don't think that's exactly...
Oooooooh! Meddler! Meddler!
You know, you should really go on this show. All right, listen, I got three tickets to the Rangers tonight. What'd ya' say?
Well, I have kissed over four women. Do you wanna get under the covers?
People do stupid things when they're upset.
What do we use to split it?
Might wanna open with the snowman.
I'd like a Google Card.
Oh-aw my God! Now, I understand if you never want to sleep with me again, but that would be wrong. We're too good! We owe it, to sex!
That's the perfect amount!
Well, yeah actually.
Well, in spite of the yummy bagels and palpable tension, I've got pants that need to be altered.
Oh, you're right I, I should play in the hay. Forget about the fact that I just dropped 400 dollars to replace a bracelet that I hated to begin with. Bring on the hay.
I know, she's been such a big part of my life. And it feels like when Melrose Place got cancelled. I mean... oh, forget it. I miss Melrose Place!
OK, well that's the part where I'm a wank. But I was hoping we wouldn't focus on that. Hey, c'mon man, I said I was sorry like a hundred times, I promise I will never take it off my. . . wrist. But if, if you want to stay in there and be mad, you know, you just uh, you stay in there.
Dear God! This parachute is a knapsack!
That was amazing!
I mean, especially considering how tough it's been for you to find work.
Well, we could count again.
I'll take this one too Uh ... Mommy?
Fine!
Right, right. Sometimes you guys just burst into flames.
Ugly Naked Guy got a Thighmaster!
Hello! Little ones.
Wow, in 45 minutes you can find her twice.
What?!
And uh, Rachel, glad to have you back.
So you don't have the cameras?!
No-no-no-no-no! You can't!
April 18th, excessive noise. Italian guy's gay roommate comes home with the dry-cleaning. Well that's excellent.
Oooh! I hope you're happy too, honey!
Hi.
I am strong! I'll show you!
Did you do it on our invitations?!
That's correct.
Joey! Joey!!
Knock-knock. Who's there? Ross Geller's lunch. Ross Geller's lunch, who? Ross Geller's lunch, please don't take me. Okay?
All right ladies, here's what we're gonna do. You are gonna take off my clothes. You two, go get the oils. And you just constantly scream at the top of your voice, "Chandler's the king! Chandler's the king!"
I'm sorry, did you say cheese?
It's the theme from Good Will Humping.
Don't ask me, I was in there canoodling you!
Why?
Ah!
I'm not supposed to tell you.
What are you doing here?
But, we'll stay here with you.
It's a four.
The meaning of the box is three fold. One , it gives me the time to think about what I did. Two , it proves how much I care about my friendship with Joey. And three , it hurts!
What?!
Nope, nope, I'd just ah, I'd rather talk to you. Yes, I do. Yes, I do have to go to the bathroom.
Okay.
Are you trying to get everybody divorced?
I'm just trying to help you out! Okay? I wanna make sure that you're okay.
Ah, there we go.
Bye bye.
You guys ready fore the movies?
So, what do you thing the good news is?
Stripping!
I know..
Now this feels like Thanksgiving.
Phoebe thinks you and Don are soul mates, and I don't believe in that kind of stuff. But then you two totally get along. So look, I won't stand in your way if you want to run off with Don and live in a house of cheese.
Hey!
Much sense?!
Why?! I mean if this guy was me and it was me who had learned that it was me who was the best you'd ever had, I'd be going like this.
What a geek!
The British are coming?
Oh, And We Should Warn You, Before You Watch It don't watch it.
It was an accident. Not like I was across the street with a telescope and a box of donuts.
Well you proved them wrong.
I don't have your boots.
Okay, so Richard, Richard!
I'm so glad we've got adjoining rooms!
Yeah. Yeah, but it was a really, really long time ago! Does she still feel bad?
I love you so much.
What does a guy have to do to be taken seriously around here?!
Really?!
I just think that things would go a lot smoother if we each have our own zone. Phoebe, you can be in charge of wiping. And y'know Mon, you can be in charge of diapering and I can be in charge of looking how cute they are when they put their hands around...
The Sooner State, whatever that is.
Hey! What's up?
Howdy.
All right, call it in the air.
Monica, we are not ready to have two babies!
Yes, include more people in this.
Oh, uh.. I want her to think I might be in a restaurant.. y'know? I might have some kind of life, like I haven't been sitting around here honing for the past few hours.
Hey.
Hi!
Okay, I will do it. But I have to warn you; this may make me a better person and that is not the man you feel in love with!
Emma, how old are you? How old are you today?
No-no-no, y'know what? I really shouldn't have said that you were embarrassing me, I mean that really wasn't cool. And if it makes you feel any better, I've had a really lousy day.
What?
I love you.
You're welcome. Hey Joey, thanks for parking the car .
That would be advice!!
No, I let him win-Ross!
You really think that is what he meant?
Well get rid of her, obsessive and shrill.
Really? In front of all this people?
Oh, I don't think I ever heard that story.
What? What did you take a picture of?
Phoebe.
Hey.
This, this actually is a...
I-I think we have too.
Well I was... I was exactly expecting company after... 9:15.
Shall I carve?
Nice try.
Hey.
Me and Frank and Phoebe, Graduation 1965.
Oh no-no, I can't do that.
Because I'm in love with Monica!!
Thanks!
Damn! The tailpipe's not hot enough to light this!
Hey, guys, it's after midnight, merry Christmas everyone.
Nice job Joe! You're quite the craftsmen.
Did you know this about him?
And yet I never run into Beyonce!
Whoa, she's pretty.
Guys, I'd listen to her. The vein is bigger than I've ever seen it.
Hey, you must be Owen.
I drew my own bath, but I did it wrong! The water's tepid. The salt didn't dissolve and is now... lodged places. And the scents I used don't compliment each other. Eucalyptus and chamomile-Oh!
I had one.
Hey, Joe, I gotta ask. The girl from the Xerox place buck naked , or, or a big tub of jam.
Let me tell you about this chick I scored with last night! Oh no wait a minute that was you!
I think I should get the chair!
That was... Impressive.
Yeah, I mean when you were late last night, Kathy and I got to talking, and one thing to another and...
Yeah, sure. What do you need? We got lace, satin, sateen, raffia, gingham, felt, and I think my testacles may be in here too.
It's OK. It's OK. I was always rooting for you two kids to get together.
Yeah.
Joey...
No!
Don't say that. Don't tangle the dream and take it away.
Ha!
Alright, alright, alright. It's been fourteen and a half minutes and you still have not said one word. Oh God, do something. Just make contact, smile!
Phoebe, would you take a look at this mess!!!!
Can I finish my story?!
You're shooting with Althea?!
Joe. Joe! Answer the phone.
Nice!
Yeah.
Monica! Can I talk to you for a second? Listen, I appreciate you getting me the costume...
Well, have you guys made anything that maybe I can take credit for?
It's not all juice!
If this is the way all the Gellers flirt, we don't have a problem.
No, we're just four people with neck problems. You talk like this.
Oh Maria. You can't say no to her, she's like this lycra spandex covered gym...treat.
Well, you can't say we don't know how to throw a party.
You know, this is actually good, because if we ever lose Ross, we have a spare.
Next time you snore, I'm rolling ya over!
What? What can't you do?
Why not?!
Would you get that please? People have been calling to congratulate me all day.
...also I was the point person on my company's transition from the KL-5 to GR-6 system.
There's gonna be a wedding. You're gonna be the bride. Two hundred people are going to be looking at you in a clean white dress.
There has got to be a way!
No!
This guy invented Moss 865! Every office in the world uses that program!
Oh! Right.
Okay, listen this really hurts. Let's go.
Shh! It is a family name!
Ohh.
Yes!
No, Eddie likes to keep it over there.
Y'know, I saw a wine cellar downstairs...
Oh, sweet Lord. New realms of pleasure!
I think it's necessary.
Uh-huh.
I have you.
Ni-hi-ice!
The Velveteen Rabbit was brown and white!
Okay!
Okay, okay, here she comes! How do I look? Do I look like a guy who doesn't want to get married?
OK well here, we'll just move the coffee table closer to the couch.
You don't get a lot of 'doy' these days...
Is that your tiny little box, that's too small to put anything in?
Listen, I just wanted to apologize about this afternoon and the whole massage thing. Y'know? I-I really like 'em.
Oh, see, I had to tell her that my number was your number, because I couldn't tell her that my number was my number because she thinks that my number is Bob's number.
Ahh, Gepeto, $5,000 dollars? Are you insane?
Arghhhhhh!!
Where are they? Where are they?
Oh come on!!
At least as long as I have the pants.
Hi...dad.
I'm not sure what they did, but I'm inclined to blame Enron.
Oh, hi! Excuse me, is uh Rachel Green here? I was supposed to meet her for lunch.
Alright, lo...look. I don't smoke anymore. But if the rest of you want to light up, go ahead, it's fine. So you all smoke then? That's almost rude, that I'm not.
Because that would be crazy?
Alright, what have we learned so far?
Uh Kathy, with K or a C?
Hey.
Okay!
Well, invisible kids can be that way sometimes.
Oh, yeah, that hug looked pretty brutal.
Well, thanks a lot for hookin' me up Rach. I want you to know that I want you to attend our wedding as my guest.
Ah, let's see. What next? Blow a bubble. A bubble's good. It's got a... boyish charm, it's impish. Here we go.
I mean, I know that's not possible, but he does.
No! No! No! I can't do that!
No, honey you're not sick! Look, I don't love you because you're organized, I love you in spite of that.
All right...
You are aware that she's not a monkey, right?
That's sweet.
I believe the foundation of our friendship was unfortunate hair. All right, look, if we're really gonna do this... it's not like you never broke one of the pacts.
We're just here to say goodbye, we're off to Ohio.
I am your friend, and I am not gonna let you do this!! You are surprisingly strong!
Oh, that's OK, we'll figure something out.
So this is nice! I wish I didn't have to go, believe me! But unfortunately I have to. Oh uh, by the way, what's the name the girl you're dating?
Okay, but impersonating a police officer is a serious thing. You could get arrested.
Well she totally called me on it, okay. She said, 'cut it out, get real', and I did.
Yes, I believe we can expect a call from the President any moment now.
Cheese, it's smelly. You must smell a lot of the time too.
Well, gosh. That makes me feel so special and good.
Oh, I think I have the cash.
Bob? Ooh, working here with us? Everyday? Yeah, I don't know if he has what it takes.
No.
Do you want me to be afraid of you?
Really?
Hey.
Why are you napping over here instead of over at your place?
Yeah, I'm sorry man.
What is it?
You not gonna believe this: She lied! She tricked me into having sex with her.
Yeah?
Oh, that's The Wedding March. Does, does that freak you out?
Because we hate them.
Oh, don't worry, we'll find them.
So, we'll tell the truth and who knows, maybe she'll like us for us.
Laundry. Huh. Is that my new nickname?
I just saw Janice.
It's so good I don't know what I've done to deserve it!
I can't believe it! We're here!
'Cause he was just so darn cute.
You got me.
Nice shooting!
Is there a puppy here?
No. How are ya Paul?
Fine, let's do it.
Dude that is so sad.
Hello.
You roll another hard eight and we get married here tonight.
Umm?
You're a little high maintenance.
Well, aren't you a treat.
Yes.
We got the honeymoon.
Hey, you feelin' better?
Hey! I need you to set me up for a joke. Later, when Monica is around, I need you to ask me about fire trucks.
You know, it haunts me? Up 'til now, the worst thing I ever saw, was my father doing tequila shots off the naked houseboy. After this, I would gladly make that my screensaver!
Oh no-no-no, no. No, no, no, I just, I just need a pretend ticket.
Oh. Y'know, that night meant a lot to me too, and it wasn't because I was in a bad place or anything, it just meant a lot to me 'cause, you're really hot! Is that okay?
Really.
David is going to propose to Phoebe tonight!
Ross!
Oh, no, no. Nina... ..she is whooo wewee-woo whoo whoo! In fact, if you asked her right now, she would have no recollection of being fired at all, none at all.
What 'not work out'? I'm seeing her again on Thursday. Didn't you listen to the story?
Well this one's for you.
Oh, yay...
She went on one of those spray-on tan places.
All right, rock on.
Somebody wanna help me, tryin' to rip out my heart. Uh, that's great. Anybody seen a nipple?
Hey, look at all the boxes!
No, if crazy plate lad.. If Monica dies then I would get Emma, Right?
Joe...
Huh? Where, whaddya mean?
We don't. Not until it's a hundred percent. I mean, why upset everybody over nothing.
Yep.
Or what my Father called Thursday night.
There are seven?! That's one?
No-no, I mean what, what's this about your new place?
Right now, right here. Don't ya think we're in kind of a public plaaaa They do have the shrimp.
Hey, that's... that's 'joincidence' with a 'C'!
No.
What?
Hi!
Okay, all right, all right, all right! Okay! Okay, here's something, here's something blue and new.
Do you?
Actually, in Oklahoma smoking is legal in all commune areas and offices with fewer than fifteen people.
Yeah. Yes! Yeah.
What are you doing?
Right, calm down, O'Mally. I'll slip him some money.
Please don't do that again, it's a horrible sound.
You do? That's fantastic!
You don't owe me anything, I don't want you money...
Pff, easy for you to say, he's a father killer. He probably loves him mommy. He's probably got a tattoo that says "mom" on his shovel-wielding arm!
You had a bachelorette party?!
You got it.
Oh, yeah?
Hey!
Hello Phoebe, I've been thinking about you all day.
Consider Casey.
Her ankle is what you're watching?
Yeah, for about 30 minutes.
Well, there are other ways of winning back your money, how about a little uh, a little Blackjack?
Madre Sierra the of Treasure!
No, no, no, no, no, NO! No, no... we're not together. We're not a couple. We're definately not a couple.
Okay, now will you guys get out of here? I want this is to be a surprise and she's gonna know.
I was making a coconut phone with the professor.
I'm not even getting married! Okay, this is a question for science fiction writers!
A dinosaur died a million years ago?
Happy plane-aversary.
Yes, of course.
No! No-no-no-no-no-no. It sounds like they really need you down there.
Oh, so that's why the priest threw holy water on me. Okay, listen, you have to cheer up! Okay? You should come out with Ross and me, I mean anything is better than sitting around here crying all day about Kate.
The doctor.
I gotta stop this.
That fake British woman is a real bitch, but she sure can dance... Hey!
Ross had a ring?! And he was gonna propose?
Panicking! And using the Internet to try to prove that I'm related to Monica. How is she?
Morning.
Well, stuff like where we'd live, y'know? Like a small place outside the city, where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff. Y'know, we could have a cat that had a bell on its collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door. Of course, we'd have an apartment over the garage where Joey could grow old.
Oh, I'm so sorry!
So, uh, you met someone, huh?
What!? They are totally ripping us off!
First of all. Bravo. Uh, but I really don't think you're right for this. The part calls for a stuffy college professor.
The reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make a big deal out of it.
Yes, but this is Pete. Okay? He's not like other people, on your first date he took you to Rome. For most guys that's like a third or fourth date kinda thing.
I'll...I'll get you later!
You should be. You're really on top of stuff..
But if we win, we get your apartment.
Get in here! Hey, and you can not smoke in here! Merry Christmas.
I don't know. But I know I'm not afraid to do this.
Hi!
Hey, stick a fork in me, I am done.
Okay, you know, you know when your in bed, with a woman.
Oh the humanity.
All right, maybe I should call her.
Okay. Okay, now wait a minute that was totally different.
Look, I'm telling you this is just like my parents divorce, which is when I started smoking in the first place.
Honey, I don't like baths! Could you draw me a picture of us having sex on the balcony?
I did break up with her! She just took it really, really well!
We don't have to come up with this now.
I wanna quit the gym.
You know, I don't get this. A month ago, these people were my friends. You know, just because I'm in charge doesn't mean I'm a different person.
What?
Will you excuse me I have to um.....
Hey, Kicky. What're you doing?
Eh. I thought that was an alp.
That was you!
Hey, can I talk to you about this groomsman thing? If you pick Ross, he'll walk you down the isle just fine. But if you choose me, you'll be getting some comedy!
Yeah I know.
Hi Monica.
Oh, yeah?
I dunno what it is, it just doesn't quite feel like Christmas to me.
But I love swing music!
Where have you been?! I tried to call you! I want to talk to you! I still feel so bad!
Let me see what you wrote about yourself: "Doctor Paleontology, two kids... " You split with Carol because you have different interests?... I think you split with Carol because you've one very similar interest!
I don't think this town is big enough for both of us to relax in. Draw!!
Here, here!
I know, what are we gonna do?
I am pretending.
You've reached Monica and Chandler's, if you're listening to this message, we're probably screening. Yeah we are.
Oh that's so funny because we found someone too.
Aah, y'killing me!
Here you go.
I know, this is a great apartment.
Nine times! Okay, I had to put on lotion! But, it's gonna be okay, because as of tomorrow I'm conducting an experiment, and if all goes as planned, my butt will be smack free.
Aaaaand....... hernia.
She did not have to tell me, I saw the play, and there was no heat. Back me up here, Ross!
Forty-five minutes? We have tickets to the Musicman at 8:00.
We can talk about that.
Ah sure. What's in 'em?
Ok. First of all, this is green!
I will tell the story! It was going great. I let him win. We were bonding. He even said I could call him dad.
You win.
You remember Janice.
Hey.
That's so cool. I'll let Monica know.
Bad London!
You're right, it has been you dream for over 15 seconds.
He- he- he got in, he- he got in to San Diego.
I think so. Yeah, get off me.
You okay over there?
Y'know, if you're gonna work late, I could look in on him for you.
Ahh, no thanks. No chicken, bye-bye then.
C'mon, I'll show you to my room. ...That sounds so weird when it's not followed by "No thanks, it's late."
I can't believe we live here!
mmm That's enough about you!
Let's go!
Wow! That sandwich really does smell good.
Oh, hey, when she gets here, is it ok if I introduce you two as "my wife" and "the woman who's carrying my child"? No? Divorce?
I don't, I hate Joseph, ok. I think he's a brown-nosing suck up.
We really need to take those tests?
Just coffee! Where are we gonna hang out now?
I stayed home from work today while you were at rehearsal so somebody could be here with our chick!
Well, listen I ah, still have one more person to ah meet, but unless it turns out to be your sister, I think you're chances are pretty good. All right.
I have to! Okay? It's time! Okay, I hate dogs.
Oh my God, it's that Victoria's Secret model. Something... something Goodacre.
Hey.
I'm sorry.
Umm, how's it going with you guys?
Whatever I decide to do, I'm gonna be starting a career from scratch. It's gonna be a while before I make a living at it. Maybe now is not the right time to be starting a family.
Yeah, we could do that without y'know risking our lives at all!
Come on, you're going to Bloomingdale's with Julie? That's like cheating on Rachel in her house of worship.
What's the matter?
Actually it's both of us.
Ho-oh, he's gonna get some! Of the glare from the streetlight out of his apartment. Y'know so umm, he's closed the drapes there so he can have a nice, pleasant conversation with your little sister. Well, I'm off to bed!
Okay.
Well, thanks man. Now I can get my pony.
I want to say you but, that seems like such an easy answer.
You want me to wear your panties?
Yeah well, too bad we're gonna have to return them.
I see where you're goin'!
Don't look honey. Change the channel! Change the channel!
Yeah!
Period math?
Yeah, I understand.
What?
No, it's a book that's just a book, okay? It's an early edition of the Velveteen Rabbit. It was her favorite book as a kid. So, uh, just... let me know if she likes it, okay?
Yes!
I don't think I have to hear the rest. Advertising makes perfect sense. Sorry you had to waste all this time, though.
Yeah. Hey, here's an idea, why don't we use our wedding china today?
Uh, uh.
Yes, it's also 2003.
The comedian? USO?!
This reminds me of a very specific part of the tape. Okay, here we go.
I watched it!
What happened?!!
No, he's right, I'm totally lying.
Condoms?
Chandler.
It's a great idea.
I missed most of the party Charlie's a girl, right?
Joey!
I mean, You wouldn't want any part of me to get any bigger would you? Don't answer that.
Y'know, we haven't found anybody else.
BEND OVER?!!!
Oh that was yours? Uh, yeah, we used it when the duck was throwing up caterpillars.
Phoebe if it helps Alexandra has only been massaging Monica for like three years. If! I said, "If it helps!"
Okay, now when you come back I hope you remember that, that chick is not a toy!
Yes, Bunny?
No, we'll-we'll bring it back! Just put it under your dress.
Hey!... aaaaaahhhh!
Well, you couldn't get them anyway. Ian doesn't plan anymore and Derrick... And Derrick is a name I shouldn't know.
Wow! She looks great. Doesn't she?
I don't know! He went crazy! Y'know, we were playing that game where you-you ask a question and you answer it really fast.
Well, I think, I think Ross knows about me and Monica.
OK, so at this point, the dealer...
I hope you know what I'm giving up for ya, because she's not just the boss in your office, if you know what I mean.
A face ass?
You don't like him.
Yeah so, Tuesday?
I sure did.
No, I saw a picture of you covered in blueberries.
I just came over to drop off...nothing. So that weekend kinda sucked, huh?
...And boogie!
Yeah, well, sorry doesn't bring back the little piggy that cried all the way home! I hate this stupid day! And everything about it! I'll see you later.
Oh, the duck seems to think that Monica got me garbage! Hmm, I wonder what I could get Monica that's as good as garbage?
Janice, you're--
Congratulations.
Honey, she keeps canceling on us, take the hint.
Oh yeah!
Call me!
Well, it's not.
Why?
Oh dear God, there's two of them!
I don't know exactly.
Um, ok... the... the fifth dentist caved and now they're all recommending Trident?
What is the matter with you?
You do?
Go change! She doesn't want her parents to know she's drunk.
Did you have a crush on me, when you first met me?
Bob. Bob! Bob!!! What the hell are you doing?!
Oh, I just went for a walk, around the living room. Whatever...
No, the baby's out! Look, look!
Hey!
Ahh, I believe my exact words were, 'Flaign,en - sten'. I mean I didn't know what to say, how do you know if you wanna do it on an elevator?
I'll tell you what, I will go get them developed and you can go home.
So um, Mary-Angela, what's your second favorite?
Ok, look! Enough is enough!
You don't think I get up when you get up?
You don't even have a car!
Okay.
Well, that's the best kiss I've had with anyone I've ever met in a men's room.
What?
That's what I did. Wah-pah!
What are you guys doing out here?
Yeah, in fact my father was a den-mother.
So I was right. This is what it feels like to be right. It's oddly unsettling.
You knew about this?
Yes, you can pass for 19.
It's a hand. It's a thing you use as a Jack and Coke holder.
She said she'd call me.
What, like a number?
Uh, Magellan? You got 46 states.
Hi! I'm back. Yeah, that sounds great. Okay. Well, we'll do it then. Okay, bye-bye.
I did!
Well, I think it's great that you're going on a date, you know? I mean, it sounds healthy. I mean, you have needs. Embrace your womanhood!
Oh, not with my combination of ice cubes, aloe Vera and my gentle self-loathing touch.
Okay.
Wow, Ralph Lauren is really going out of there way to show they're not in the baby buying business.
Let's call 'em.
That's great. All right, I gotta get to work, I got a big dinosaur bone to inspect.
Oh wow, I hope you don't take this the wrong way but, I know we had plans to meet up tonight and, ugh, I'm just kinda worried about what it might do to our friendship.
Y'know, maybe this isn't such a big deal. Y'know, I mean, the way that I see it is you get a great job and you get to have sex. Y'know, I mean, throw in a tree and a fat guy and you've got Christmas.
Ohh! You guys gonna be living together again?
Okay, are you aware unagi is an eel?
Just do it! Okay, it's Janice and if I get it I'm going to have to see her tonight. Oh, that's great I'm gonna have to see her tonight.
It's my joke.
Yes.
Goodnight.
Oh come on you big faker!
"The Firm"?
Yeah, come on, it's Ross and Rachel, they've got too.
Sorry.
Cookie?
That's great!
I did pay for half of it.
Whoa-whoa-whoa! What?
Ok!
Oh come on, come on, it can't be that bad.
'Scuse me.
Absolutely!
Well what is wrong with me? Am I .. am I incomptent? Because I managed to survive whatever it is that killed the three of you!
I know, that, that's why I don't want to go tonight, I'm afraid I'm going to say something stupid.
If we keep talking this way, aren't we gonna freak her out soon?
So, a lot of malfunctioning wee-wees and hoo-hoos in this room, huh?
That's a good plan, Joe. Next time we wanna pick up women, we should just go to the park and make out. Taxi, taxi!
That-that's bad?
Pregnant Woman Slays Four?
Alright you guys are off to party number one and you, you are off to party number two Alright fellas, let's keep it movin', let' keep it movin.
Well, actually just one birthday flan.
Would you like me to write her a little poem as well?
NO!!!
Really?
Ooh, I don't know if we're there yet.
I'm coming already!!
Are you eating the cheesecake without me?!
Because that's where Joey gave me some stuff to store that I've never seen before in my life! Okay, that did not just happen!
Yeah, I'm not gonna pay for those acting classes anymore.
All right! I'm putting it out, I'm putting it out.
Oh my goodness! Where did you hide it?
Get ready to run. Congratulations on your wedding.
I'm serious!
What?
There are seven?!
Oh that's all right, I have it memorized. It's 1A.
No, no, no, no! No, no, no, no! It's okay, it's okay. I didn't go. Don't cry, it's just a bit! I'm your uncle Chandler; funny is all I have!
Yes, how 'bout a verse of Killing Me Softly. You're gonna sneeze on my fish, aren't you?
Oh my God!
Uh, no Pheebs. What's it look like?
Oh that's great!
Nope! I can do this all day.
Where's my seat belt?
Yes talk to her. Be a man.
Hey!
Then why didn't you tell me to do that?!!
So, uh, how was he?
Okay, it's his first time out, so he's probably gonna wanna do some of the touristy things. I'll go to Cats, you go to the Russian Tea Room.
That's a good idea. I wonder where I could get a basket of porn...
No, no. But let me show you what I can do. "Bagels and donuts. Round food for every mood."
Hey Bobby.
No, there are great pictures of you standing next to a guy who's going like this...
Yeah, let's celebrate life!
I think so.
Hey.
What? What?
Come on, Ross, you gotta get back in the game here, ok? The Rachel thing's not happening, your ex-wife is a lesbianI don't think we need a third...
Oh my God!
Because I'm gonna play for ya.
Oh no-no, no you don't, just come back.
All right, I suppose I can wait a day. Hey, what are you doing Friday?
Yeah. So do we need to hug here or. . .
And?
Ross, a sports car? Wouldn't it have been cheaper to just stuff a sock down there?
Heh.
Oh my God!
What?
In London?
Yes! Two thousand dollars exactly! How do you know that!
Totally. I had sex in High school...
Oh yeah, your uh, name came up in a uh, conversation that terrified me to my very soul.
Okay. My word! Those are snug.
That thing that I have to do to make a baby. I faked it.
Are you serious?
Yeah.
What? No, I'm taking Monica to a romantic inn in Vermont !
No. No! No! No!
Get off!
I'm not breaking up with her!
Yeah, I coulda counted to three like four times without all this 'two' talk.
Can somebody else hug him? I have to stay by the window.
You said no right?
Okay!
Well, you have to honest with her! Otherwise you may think that you're going down the same path, but you're really going down different ones.
I don't know. Except that, for one last time... Good game, good game, good game, good game, good game, good game, good game.
Well, it's a training program, but at the end, they hire the people they like.
I don't think so.
Yeah, he came up...
What?
No-no-no-no, this is bad! It's bad! This is bad!
You slept with somebody three hours after you thought you broke up. I mean bullets have left guns slower!
What are you doing here?
Goodnight.
If I'm gonna be an old, lonely man, I'm gonna need a thing, you know, a hook, like that guy on the subway who eats his own face. So I figure I'll be Crazy Man with a Snake, yknow. Crazy Snake Man. And I'll get more snakes, call them my babies, kids will walk past my place, they will run. "Run away from Crazy Snake Man," they'll shout!
Ok, on your mark... Get set... GO!!!
I'll do it.
He can do more than that! He can destroy the universe!
What gay thing?
Or 'You're such a nice guy' means 'I'm gonna be dating leather-wearing alcoholics and complaining about them to you'.
Oh hey. I'd shake your hand but uh; I'm really into the game. Plus, I think it'd be better for my ego if we didn't stand right next to each other.
This is going in your book?
I'm sorry. That's the one thing I can't do. I promised I'd be with Monica.
Yes, yes, it's just that we ah, we kinda all ready, made plans with Ross.
Okay, this is good, this is good. All right listen, I have one. Janice likes to cuddle, at night, which, you know I'm all for. But, uh, you know when you want to go to sleep, you want some space. So, uh, how do I tell her that without, you know, accidentally calling her fat or something.
So ah, your first sexual experience was with a woman?!
No! Smokes-A-Lot Lady blew smoke directly into my mouth. Eh-uh-are you okay?
Hey.
That's totally understandable.
We already knew that!
You mean with Casey.
And condoms are the way to do that?
Yeah.
Hello!
Hi.
Oh actually, I'd rather you...Yeah, go ahead. We're gonna have to burn that room down anyway.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, it just seems that Robert isn't as concealed in the shorts area, as ah, one may have hoped.
Thank you!
Ok, so it's just because it was my table, I have to buy a new one?
No he's, he's alright, just uh, he spends most of his time in his room.
Oh, well then, if anybody should have a party it should be him.
Look, she's not backing down! She went like this!
Please?
Hang on, she's right here. Someone's on the phone, for ya.
I don't have anything against the beautiful guest room, especially since everybody we know lives about 30 seconds away!
Yeah I even got a ring. Did you get a ring?
Oh yeah. First off all, chasing the Churo guy isn't jogging.
No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no!!! You can't come in here! R-r-r-r-Ross is naked.
Like what?
Hi.
Hey.
Hey man, how did the audition go?
Who walks into a room and asks to see a person's hands?!
Yes it was very sad when the guy stopped drawing the deer!
Well, yeah, but y'know, what-what if I was wrong?
Well I just, thought maybe you'd wanna book some time with the best you'd ever had.
Hey!!
Ok, pure evil, horny and alone. I've done this.
Yeah, get out!
No! That would be so awkward! Look-Besides, we work in different departments. He's on the sixth floor y'know? So he calls me Toby once in a while. What's the big deal? It could be worse, it's not like he's calling me Muriel.
Yeah, I'm putting my foot down. Yeah look, when I proposed I told you that I would do anything to make you happy, and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy then, then that's what we're gonna do.
Yeah, because if I was at my old job we'd say 300 million? No thank you!
That's our phone number. Now look, I know I kinda sprung this whole me moving out on thing, so why don't I just-why don't I just cover you for a while?
You guys haven't actually met before, but, boy! You're both polite! Go to have a seat Zack, and I'll get you a beer.
Poor Ross.
Wow, he looks so normal.
Look, maybe I got carried away before. But there's something you gotta know. If I'm the best, it's only because you've made me the best.
Yeah, but I bet it works.
No, no, Phoebs. You know why? Cause he's dead.
Alright, so what's it about?
How far outside?
Well, I-I just didn't think it was funny sir.
Oh fresh air!
Yeah, she, she brought the invisible cab. . . hop in.
Skidmark's still got a way with the ladies.
I can save you time ladies, I'm right here.
I'll do it!
No! No! No!
Hey Eddie, you uh, wanna play some foosball?
Hey, I didn't make up the rules. Now, after you receive the doubling bonus, you get uh, one card. Now that one card could be worth $100 bringing your total to 1,500. Don't get to excited because that's not gonna happen unless you get-No way!
You mean scared.
Oh yeah? Is he funnier than me?
Hey!
Okay, okay. So, should I call her?
Well, you're welcome. And tell them we're really glad they're coming.
Oh. You mind if I join you?
That's very funny. We done now?
That's the way I did it 'til I was 19.
All right! Okay! I think I am making some progress with Joey, when I went into the apartment he went straight into his bedroom but he only slammed the door once! I mean yeah, he gave me the finger while doing it.
What?
I have *not* thought this through!
You know, I'd love to, but I'm a little tired.
Because it's a relaxing and enjoyable time!
No! Her boyfriend Richard!
One more game?
Well what's the difference? Your eggs aren't here anymore, are they? You took your eggs and you left. You really expect me to never find new eggs?
Okay, it's not a guy, all right, I know her.
Is that a hint? Because we love you Doctor Connelly but we don't think we'd want you to be our child! Wow, talking about an inhospitable environment!
No no no. Good. So you're moving on? Do you have any idea where you're moving?
Hey!
We're not gonna talk about girth are we?
...in you, my endless love. My endless love.
We're trying to get pregnant. Y'know I'm not really comfortable doing this in front of the babies. So, when do you want to start trying?
Nice!
You know you don't want me to help. You can't have it both ways!
So, you still don't think I'm boyfriend material?
It is a crime that you and I don't spend more time together.
And I think Ross is generous too.
Wait a minute, it's perfect. We got a lot of time to kill and we're in a building that's full of beds!
Ooh! Israeli champagne. And it's vanilla!
You.
See, maybe that's the one we should've actually hidden.
Now I've upset you? What did I say?
It's all very, very good. So you wanna go uh, mix it up?
Why would you say that?
Stop talking, stop talking now. Let me just get this straight. You're actually stealing my hat?
Oh, we're gonna flip for the baby?
Ok!
Hardest thing I've ever done in my life.
When was the last time you saw her wear it?
So, you feel like a dad yet?
You got it. Good woman! Could we get a bottle of your most overpriced champagne?
Okay, something to cover the smell ... Oven cleaner! Unscented!
Oh o-, OK man.
Excuse, I seem to have dropped my ball.
Why have I seen this thing three times?!
What? Why?
Yeah, you got me. I'm out five big ones! Here you go.
What an interesting approach to guitar instruction. Y'know some might find it amusing, I myself find it regular.
That's Mr. Girabaldi playing the piano.
Bye!
You mean the lully story?
OK, stop.
Ross' shirt is torn.
You know what? I'm not gonna end up like this. I'll see you man.
Oh, he's in the back. The duck pissed him off, said that eggs came first.
Wow that's actually pretty cool.
Okay man.
Well, Ross and Emily aren't gonna use it.
Yeah, you think so, well? Should I ask him?
Please God don't let it be Kung Pow Chicken.
Screw the Knicks!
Happy New Year!
And Milton Berle has a...
Are you sure? Did you see the stain?
Nope! Because I'm not your boyfriend. Hey Pheebs, how did it go?
Hit yourself in the tooth?
Wow! Fortunately she has a very pretty face!
He started mine first!
Oh I'm sorry! Do you need a break?
Really?
To Monica!
Monica can I talk to you outside for a minute?
Central Perk?
See, now, why would you assume that? Just because we're married? I will have you know that we are very hip, happening people. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to get back to reading the obituaries.
Marcel swallowed a Scrabble tile.
Ok, you can not do this to me.
Me.
Stop making candy!
Ok, good night. You big freak of nature.
Hey-hey, hey! I don't know why I did that!
Oh, come on Monica, reliving past pain and getting depressed is what Thanksgiving is all about. Y'know, for me anyway. And of course, the Indians.
With the claw?!
Don't try to make me uncomfortable with feminine stuff!
I'm goin' home.
Monica.
Oh, come on! It's not like this is an everyday occurrence for me! I mean usually I'm pretty much just in there by myself.
All right, look, look. What did... what did you get for Angela Delveccio for her birthday?
Hey!
We didn't get to the audition. I'm gonna take her to coffee and then we'll do it then.
Ahhhh-I'm not going to call you.
Hey.
Why would the baby creep me out?
Hey Ross, I was wondering if... Oh my God!! Where are all the men???
Oh, you must stop shooping.
Bye! Thank God
You got a man who's a nanny...? You got a manny...?
Pheebs!!
I turned it off. Mother of God, I turned it off!
OK, now wait a minute. That is the craziest typing test I've ever seen.
I'm sorry but, ow-owww-owww!
But...
Hey-hey.
Yes! You want babies! You have baby fever!
Ladies? Ross's speech is in 45 minutes.
You told us both we could be in the wedding?
I'm pretty sure I put her on my bed.
Why not?
Yeah?
Hey, y'know what, if you're gonna do that, if you're gonna name him Joey, you should name him Chandler. Oh, come on! Chandler's funny, sophisticated, and he's very loveable, once you get to know him.
Those aren't eleven and a half.
Dog grooming huh? Okay, just don't make my tail too poofy.
Okay!
Oh, and Sheena Easton. But we probably couldn't get her anyway.
It is when you put it together with that one.
Look what do I do? I wanna get past this, I don't wanna be afraid of the commitment thing. I wanna go through the tunnel, to the other side!
Why did you look at me when you said that?
No. But uh, Joey has, and I usually talk to them in the morning time.
Ohh, that's a good one.
Ok, you know how most kids get their allowance from mowing the lawn or taking out the garbage, well I earned mineby plucking the eyebrows of my father and his "business" partners.
Why, it's six tickets to Hootie and the Blowfish! The Blowfish!
Just one more thing. I was so pissed at you that night that I wanted to get back at you. So I thought, who does Ross like the more than anybody?
No, no, you're right, it is a ridiculous name!
Call.
Oh, so that's this is gonna work now? You're just gonna order me around all the time?
Thanks. Listen, about the weekly numbers, I'm gonna need them on my desk by nine o'clock.
I just didn't want to tell you in front of them.
Really?!
Oh-oh, what are you doing?
Okay.
Are you serious?
Hey!
Me?! Why me?
I'd carry you around in my pocket.
All right look, I think it's time for you to settle down. Y'know? Make a choice, pick a lane.
Where ya going?
Well, never say never but y'know probably uh yeah, never.
It means that my guys won't get off their barcaloungers and you have a uterus that is prepared to kill the ones that do. It means...
One of life's great, unanswerable questions. I mean, who knows? Maybe there's something even more painful than those things? Like this.
You, you are gonna love this.
Ok.
How is that worse?!
Can I be that guy?
Of course I am. I reject anyone who's crazy enough to actually go out with me, and then I bitch about the fact that there aren't any great women out there.
I'd love to, but it's 2300 hours and I'm about to have the most organized sex anyone's ever had.
Guys! Guys! Come on! It's Thanksgiving, it's not important who wins or loses. The important thing is, the Dutch girl picked me! Me! Not you! Holland loves Chandler! Thank you, Amsterdam! Good night!!
Alright.
Could I be more sorry.
To see her pants?
Princess Leia in the gold bikini.
They do?
Okay! This is it! We're gonna get married!
You're right, I have no excuses! I was totally over the line.
Sorry.
Yeah, I don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet.
So, shouldn't we go give her the benefit of the doubt before we go...snooping around her crotch?
Okay, how'd it go at the doctor's?
You guys wanna eat here?
Alright. Yes, this is Rachel.
Me? No. You?
He had sex with Mr. Girabaldi!
Come on. An 80-foot inflatable dog let loose over the city. How often does that happen?
Well, I think, I think, Ross already has one. Now, this one's free, right? Because you paid for the first two, so the third one's free.
Forgive me? You haven't been taking my calls in a week!
Then you're gonna have to watch it for me.
Oh, so, forget about the birds, but big red insects suggest fine dining!
Yeah, we're gonna go.
Hey!
Well, I have a call in about that.
They couldn't be worse. I spent eight hours calling him last night, just trying to get him to talk to me.
Yeah, can I get a 3-piece, some cole slaw, some beans, and a Coke--Diet Coke.
I don't know. Maybe it's because it smells a little weird. It's like old pumpkins or something.
Why not?
Yeah-yeah, so big that it actually makes our doors look smaller!
No. When it comes to sweets, he's surprisingly strict.
Marcel?
So, why is she leaving? Is it a school night and she has a lot of homework to do?
Well, I don't really know what that is, but let's!!
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
Where's Monica?
Wow! You are way to young to have seen that!
Wrong number?
We are gonna be great parents.
I don't know, I-I have to listen to both of them, they don't exactly let each other finish...
So, Joey on Law & Order, you must be very proud!
I think she looks cute. ... but I am wrong!
Well, close to...
Wish it! Hi. Hi, I-I was just sitting over there, and uhh, Chandler. My name is Chandler. Did I say that?
Yeah.
Great!! That's great!
Hey.
Yeah, well. It's the right thing to do.
Hey, hey, those guys are takin our stuff!
Here it is! Here it is!
Oh, well...
Honey, you've been in there for a long time... Is everything okay?
All right, I'm off to see your dad.
He's right. Nobody's gonna benefit, and you're just gonna hurt her.
That's alright, I'll take it. Bad things happen to me anyway. This way I can break 'em up with a movie.
Well, she seems very nice and everything, but that whole thing about her coming all the way down here, just to see if I was okay? I mean,... how needy is that?
Why are you so sure I didn't watch this tape?
Guys are signing over their 401-K's to me?
Joey, we would've asked you, we just thought you wouldn't be interested.
Oh no-no-no, you don't want to do that, then you're gonna get stuck with Rachel and she exchanges every gift she ever gets.
Yeah.
Okay, Ross is in the bathroom.
Hey!
You had a dream about a girl that I am seeing?! Oh, that is so cool! I can't tell you how many times I've dreamt about a girl that he was seeing. Anyway we're talking about your dream. I love you. Your dream?
Oh, it's awkward. It's awkward. It's awkward.
Oh, my, god!
Okay! Now I assume the Saucer card came up when you played last.
And that's how you bought it?
Oh my God! If you say that one more time, I'm gonna break up with you!
Have you ever been with a woman?
I'll look forward to your call.
I do too.
What? Oh this is excellent. You know he coulda gotten me a VCR, he coulda gotten me a set of golf clubs, but no, he has to get me the woman repeller, the eyesore from the Liberace house of crap.
I've met the perfect woman. OK, we're sitting on her couch, we're fooling around, and then suddenly she turns to me and says, 'Do you ever want to do it in an elevator?'
No I didn't!
Please, come in.
Oh, tell her good luck with that.
Aww, I love you so...
Seriously dude, 3 years ago.
Okay, well we'll go back in there, but will you do one thing for us? The people that care about you?
Y'know I am the groom right? I was told it was kinda big deal.
Because, I-I should've called! Y'know if I had just called her after our big, stupid fight, she never would've gone out with Nick, and they would've ended up in bed together. I threw her at his man nipples!
Okay! Okay! Okay! Oh God, I thought... Wait a minute, I-I can do this. I thought that it mattered what I said or where I said it. Then I realized the only thing that matters is that you, you make me happier than I ever thought I could be. And if you'll let me, I will spend the rest of my life trying to make you feel the same way. Monica, will you marry me?
Oh, I wish I'd know you were going to do that, I ordered Chinese.
Well, I told you not to walk. Here. There. Okay.
What's the second part of your plan?
If I help, we can find 'em faster!
Yeah.
See that is the problem with invisible dentists.
Why must everybody watch me sleep? There'll be no more watching me sleep, no more watching.
Shhhh! Shhhhh! Shhhhh! Shhhhh! I can't, I can't hear you.
I've got nowhere to go this morning. I'm unemployed! I don't know what I'm gonna do with my life.
It's not gonna be exactly like last time.
Oh, I got some thoughts on that.
Well, I see you've had a very productive day. Don't you think the cowboy hat is a little much?
I'm in the bathroom, can you come in here? I think there's something wrong.
Well, she wasn't sleeping with him.
Bye.
But the Kit-Kats are all right?!
Hi! Listen, can we watch cartoons on your television? We need a porn break. We spent the last two hours watching In & Out & In, Again.
More so than anything else.
Uh-oh, it's my boss!
Oh my God!
No, no, no, guys. She's right. We should get to work. I'll take stuff out of the closet, Joey you pack 'em and Ross you re-pack whatever Joey packs.
Yeah. I really do.
Yes, we don't get married unless there's a sign! Okay, so say uh, say you roll another eight then there's a definite sign that we should get married.
Well you see in Cups, once you get $700, you have to double it.
And, I want you to remember that I gave you twenty seven dollars. No strings attached. Now, if you can't remember that, I think we should write it down-let's write it down!
I thought it was $98.50.
Well, instead of just hanging out, we figure we'd do nothing.
I'll talk to them!
No, you didn't get me!! It's an electric drill, you get me, you kill me!!
You don't know?
Oh yeah? Well thanks.
Look I'm very glad that you saved Ross from the car backfire, but y'know, it could've been a bullet and you y'know, you didn't try to save me!
Whoa-whoa-whoa! We're having kids?!
Hey!
I can't believe I ruined this.
Well, as long as the pilgrims didn't eat it, I'm in.
I was in the car with Nancy all day.
It's Clint! Clint!
Y'know who has a great video camera?
Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs!
Come on! Would you please pay attention, I could wake up at any moment!
What's going on?
Ok so, can I have my hat back?
I can see why that's hard to resist.
Thanks. You wanna see what it looks like?
Yeah, Joe, I assure you if I'm staring down the barrel of a gun, I'm pretty much peeing every which way.
Mr. and Mrs. Geller, you look wonderful, it is great to have you hear, let us take off your coats!
Does this mean we're gonna have to start paying for coffee?
Yeah!
I have my reasons.
That's fast math! We could use you in Tulsa.
Don't try to sway her. I'm your only chance to have a baby. Okay, let's go.
Ok, go quick! Ross: Thank you for a delightful stay. Ross: Oh, my maple candy!
I see, I see, y-y-you're trying to freak me out.
What about things that are already gold?
Oh it's Bing, sir. I'm sorry , I was just ah...
I think I know what you mean though...the lamp is the hotel's, but the bulbs ...oh, you already got that.
Not the disposable cameras from the tables.
Does anyone else think David Copperfield is cute?
Mazel tov!
I found a dried up seashores.
I was looking forward to playing basketball, but I guess that's out the window.
You just thought of that in there?
Okay, but you should know he eats five times a day and shoves pennies up his nose.
Go and tell Rachel right now before Ross finds out.
Hey Rach! Ah........ Perfection. Wouldn't change a thing. Not a thing.
I do limericks... uhm... There once was a man named Chandler, whose wife made him die inside.
The Hitlers will be so disappointed.
Oh no, yes we do my man. Remember when we were back in college and we went to that spring dance and you walked right up to that girl you liked and you could not stop talking about the Irish potato famine?
I used to have that bumper sticker.
Ahh, come on! Y'know what-y'know what, I think I'm just gonna go home and call Kathy.
...That's it. I'm getting cigarettes.
Oh yeah, it's actually in my bedroom.
I was kidding.
Oh honey, leave them alone, they're in love.
Oh my God!
What?!
"Look, this is ridiculous! I'm not paying for that room! Ok?" "Oh, thank you very much!" Yeah, I'm going to Vermont...
I don't know. I can't--I just, I can't get her out of my head. Y'know? I mean, I'm a very bad person. I'm a very, very bad person. I'm a horrible person. No you're not Chandler! We still love you Chandler!
New York.
Mmmm. Not tonight, honey. I got an early day tomorrow.
No I didn't!
Is it made of cheese?
Oh, just a bit of shopping. How've you been?
Yeah, I-I-I think so. Yeah, I-I think so...
Oh that's great, my friend Joey's in the movie business.
Ahhhhh!
Hey, no, I've never been lower or wetter. I'll be fine. I'll just turn your, uh, bedroom into a game room or somethin', you know, put the foosball table in there.
This is probably the wrong thing to be worrying about, but... you're getting ham on my only tie.
Which, by the way, is the real San Francisco treat. I got her machine.
Yeah, that's like the most ugliest dress I've ever seen. Wh-why do you to return it?
Okay! Okay! Okay!
Do either of you have the keys?
What is the point of having them if we never use them?
Yeah, we were just talking about that. I can't believe how stupid we used to look.
Listen can you guys uh, speak up, it's harder for us to hear you when you lower your voice.
Bermuda, Bahama, come on pretty mama...
Is this still about her whole 'The Flintstones could've really happened' thing?
Oh, tons, I'm quite the woodsman.
Oh, you dont know. Helen, could you make sure we put through the paperwork on Miss Bookbinders raise?
And it's not as if you have a boyfriend's shoulder to cry on.
Y'know I think we should invite them.
Yeah, I'm kinda wishing everyone wasn't here right now.
Very, very funny, but don't say things like that in front of Monica. I don't want you putting any ideas in her head.
Hi guys!
Well! We er..climbed up four flights of stairs, manueveored a narrow hallway, dodged a rabid pitbul... but these last three feet are where it gets really tricky.
Okay, bye!
Oh I'm sorry, you're kicking me out of my own living room?
You're an actor!
So you can balloon up or you can shrink down and I will still love you.
More coffee over here, please!
Well, you can't just not see Rachel anymore, she's one of your best friends.
Y'don't think that makes me seem a little...
I am, I actually am. I mean this is amazing. My entire life I have feared this place, and now that I'm here it's like what was the big deal. I could probably say 'Let's move in together.' and I'd be okay.
Thank you Helen, that'll be all.
I don't think the flash went off.
Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian... Did I say that out loud?
Fine with me.
Would you just please....give me the receipt 'cause this is great. It's top notch.
What's wrong? What's wrong? You're married that's what's wrong.
That's still in there?!
Well yes yes... You look nice can mean that your face looks nice. I want to compliment your body. I mean..I wouldn't change it. At all. And more specifically, I wouldn't want anything to get any bigger.
Oh, come on, there's a rest stop right up there! Come on, I really have to goooooooooo.
I'm telling you, I watched the tape.
Mon, get out here!
Hey.
Ok, now, remember, no trading. You get the pretty one, I get the mess.
Did you see our bank statement? Can this be right?
Sure. Ummm. What's up?
In a bad way?
Yeah, that'd be much worse than being 28, and still working here.
Men are here.
We can? All right, I'm tryin' that.
Okay, she is the star of the play. And she is my girlfriend! I get to have sex with the star of the play!
Ah. Chandler Bing.
Hey!
No, I have a great idea for a present for her.
The big deal is I was sitting there last, so, that's my seat.
I don't know.
Ahhh.
Well, what did the police say?
So.. let me get this straight. So my two friends die, I get Emma. Then my wife dies, then Emma the one tiny ray of hope left in my life gets taken away from me?
I got it! Scotch... tape.
Yeah.
I can't call her, I left a message! I have some pride.
Okay, no problem, just remember to wake us up before you go-go.
Ross came in forth and cried!
Yeah.
Yeah! If the car that backfired had run over you! Y'know what, I think I'll go home before Ross starts rambling about his newfound respect for life.
I need you to come to this bachelor party for my weird cousin Albert, y'know he's the botanist.
Pie eating contest?
No, no, Ross and Rachel will be back soon and then I gotta go to the office Am I producing them?
Hello, this is Chandler Bing. Somebody just dropped off a handwritten recommendation letter, and.. Uh-huh... Uh-huh... okay... thank you. Good-bye. .
Okay.
Oh-ho, liked what she saw, huh? Dug my action, did she? Checkin' out the Chan-Chan man!
Well, I thought you guys were cuddlily sleepers.
Hey!
Well, there you are! So what did Elizabeth say?
Hey!
Okay.
Okay, I promise, I'll end it.
Look around, you guys. This was your first home. And it was a happy place, filled with love and laughter. But more important, because of rent control, it was a friggin' steal!
Yeah, it's two guys in a ring, and the rules are "There are no rules."
No, no, no, actually losers rhyme.
Well?
That's what you say at the end of a date.
The only superpower you have is a slightly heightened sense of smell.
You wanna hug it out?
Hey!
Out of my league. I could get a Brian. If I wanted to get a Brian, I could get a Brian. Hey, Brian.
Okay, so now do you believe that she's attracted to me?
Should we go make a baby right now before you change your mind?
So you didn't mean any of that?!
Hey!
Plus I thought the baby would be in good hands with a doctor!
No, no, no, no, no, no No. Monica, it's Sunday morning. I'm not running on a Sunday.
Interesting, cause in my dreams, I'm allways surprisingly inadequate.
Okay.
I see. Y'know umm, Phoebe makes sock bunnies.
That all the pieces of my life are falling right into place!
A freakish thin date with a hanger for her head?
You're not actually supposed to stop on the bridge.
I know, it's beautiful. Amazing.
Are you okay?
Ross.
Okay.
Really?
This is not a sign!
Count of three?
No! I want a flabby gut and saggy man breasts!
Okay. I'm gonna get the ring! I'm gonna get the ring! I'm gonna go find her and I'm just going to propose!
Well, that's what we do. Y'know, I-I mess up and then you tell me how to fix it and then I do and then y'know you think I'm all cute again.
Ah, you obviously saw my personal ad.
I was dangerously dehydrated during the first six months of our relationship. Look, for me the rush is knowing that we are gonna be together for the rest of our lives.
Yeah, that's when if you get the babies out by the end of the month, they give you 2% financing.
NO! No, I'll take that for ya.
Okay, a little announcement, a little announcement. I've decided that my best man is, my best friend Gunther!
Don't let yourself get manipulated this way!
Oh my God!
All right, let's break this down. What exactly did he say to you?
Okay.
Yeah, we'll be down in like five minutes.
Phoebs, let me ask you something, were, were these, uh, funny brownies?
Here we go. Stand up straight. Big smile.
I know, And then all of the sudden your Mom pops into your head. And your like 'Mom, get outta here!' You know, but of course, like, after that you can't possibly think of anything else, and you can't, you know, stop what your doing. So it's kinda like, you're, you know. You know.... You don't know!
You're right, and I'm sorry! This means a lot to me! I want you to be my friend again! I swear, I won't say another word tonight.
I'd love to, but I gotta get back to talking to your parents. They're telling us all about how they adopted you.
Y'know what would really help me through this tough time is choking something. Can I choke ya?
So, uh... what do you think it is about me?
Well I like both eggs equally.
Yes, you got something from the Screen Actor's Guild.
I'd love to stay, but I have eh... got a hot date...
You be cool.
Yes. Hey, can I ask you, is Eddie a little...
Almost over man.
Okay, excuse me for a minute.
Uh, Joey's having an embolism, but I'd go for a Nip, y'know?
Great novels?
I climb down the fire escape and you can't put that in the closet?
We need the stuff.
Ross!
All right.
Okay!
Okay, I'm gonna go to the bathroom. Will you watch my phone?
Phoebe, did you see that?! He totally checked you out! He is so cute! Mine has a picture of The Village People, what does that mean?
It kills over one americans every year.
I know.
So whaddya got there Monica?
With Roger? Not just with Roger?! Oh my God!
Umm, yeah.
Oh, I just wanted to say, "Hey!"
Congratulations!
Yup, get ready for the gelatenous fun.
You can call off the roommate search! Hi! I'll be living here.
Maybe it was his sister's. You know, maybe it was his daughter's.
Really? Wow. That's some pretty powerful imaginary sperm you must have there.
I'm sorry, are you just used to saying that?
What?!
Two!
I'm gonna do it tomorrow y'know, and-and surprise her, but now you've ruined it!
Okay Ross has the cameras, has he checked out yet?
Kinda. They're really big.
Ooh. Uh, I don't know how to tell you this, but she's in Monica's bedroom, getting it on with Max, that scientist geek. Ooh, look at that, I did know how to tell you.
Damn. My mail order grandfather hasn't come yet.
I'll give you a thousand dollars to talk to us.
What question?
Yeah, I'm gonna pass. 'Cause I was kinda iffy when it was puppies.
Well, I'm gonna get another espresso. Can I get you another latte?
No you don't! No, no, no, I say you have to give your divorce another chance.
He's not supposed to ask my girlfriend to marry him! I'm supposed to do that!
Ross is wearing leather pants! Does nobody else see that Ross is wearing leather pants? Someone comment on the pants!
Yeah, Joey just pressed something on the remote and it just, came on!
What picture?
Really?! Joe? What would you do if you were in Ross's situation?
Nope... Hey... so I'm gonna... put the plates back. You know, I think you were right, I don't think we should use these plates again for a looong time.
She was.... But y'know what, just in case, maybe we should come up with a set of ground rules.
You couldn't be cool.
Hey.
No, just knowing you're gonna be there is enough.
Look, you don't have to draw an actual wo-whoa! She's hot!
Is that supposed to be funny! I was really worried over here!
Monica.
Check it out! Check it out! When the babies wake up, they can meet Krog!
So ah, isn't a bit cold out for shorts?
Because I'm in love with Monica!!
Oh-ho-ho-ho-no! No! No switching! No sharing, and don't come crying to me! Ha-ha-ha! I may just sit here and have my cake all day! Just sit here in the hallway and eat my...
That sounds like fun.
My chair. Now, if anybody asks, your name is Rosita!
Yes. Yes, and ah, ah, the trees are happy too, because for most of them, it's the only chance to see New York.
And you wonder why Ross is their favorite?
I'm so pathetic! Monica knows what she wants to say! You should've seen her. Writing, writing, writing!
Sure, nice.
Okay.
No! You're the sweetest!
Yeah, I did.
Nothing for you, you have Paolo. You don't have to face the horrible pressures of this holiday: desperate scramble to find anything with lips just so you can have someone to kiss when the ball drops!! Man, I'm talking loud!
Nothing, Monica and I had a stupid fight.
Well, I'm upset-for you. I mean, having sex with an endless line of beautiful women must be very unfulfilling for you.
That's me.
Those are all really old!
I can see it from right here. It'll cost you one husband.
Monica got ice in her eye, and it hurts.
Maybe, she doesn't hit him all the time.
For the last time no! Get out! Get out, Joey!
Oh y'know what, I was already trying to trade for ah, well, you.
Hey, look, I know what it is to be a friend, I just-I just screwed up!
Okay.
I am trying!
Are you serious?
I know it sounds really weird, but we're just so bad at relationships.
Okay, but now see you're crying!
Sydney Portier? Hehheh.
Theyre twins!
So uh, which one is mine?
Well you might if it were anything like 7!
You're not gonna die an old maid, maybe an old spinster cook.
There's a beautiful woman at eight, nine, ten o'clock!
Before you say anything, have we got a story for you! Guess who we bumped into at dinner!
Yeah, he's lived here for years, I don't, I don't know what you're talking about man.
Really?! I didn't think girls ever just wanted a fling.
Oh my God!
Oh yeah, it's great! See you take a tennis ball, a bowl, and some lighter fluid-Op! Op!
Oh no-no-no, you-yeah, of course you get to be my best man.
Y'know that whole swimming thing is a myth.
Oh yes, sir! Put me out of my misery. Are you sure you never played pro? Please let them win!
Okay Buckwheat!
That's what we were gonna name the baby.
Monica and I are celebrating our ten-month anniversary, we've got reservations at Ja George.
Dude! That's my girlfriend!
No, no, no.
Yeah.
Why are you here?
It's okay, I want this to be your night too. To Monica.
Ah, look on the bright side, I mean you won't have to live with this ugly chair! That was here already huh? I love you.
Oh right, your allergies. All her, she hates you.
Now, Monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne...
See? I told you.
How did you guys find me? I knew I should've hid at the gym!
...And what did you bring?
I know.
Oh-oh-hey!
So do you think uh, Joey's more charming than me?
...and beer!!
Ow!
No you can't.
Hey!
I was not flirting.
Really?
Becasue it reminded you of the way our forefathers used to bitch at each other?
Well, she walked in when I was looking at the ring brochures. You can understand that, right? Guys? Guys?
Okay! That's a four! And where-where's the other one?
I mean I was nothing before you. Call the other girls and ask. Which wouldn't take long. But when I'm with you, and we're together, OH...MY...GOD.
Hey, what are you doing here? Shouldn't you be at work?
Yes, it is, at Office Max.
Do you really find this attractive on him?
Obviously.
Hey, sorry I'm late. Congratulations, Mon. I'm not sorry I'm late. How incredible was my afternoon with Jade?
I was just at the bank, and there was this really hot teller, and she didn't ask me to go do it with her in the vault.
Man, if you tried something like that on my birthday, you'd be starin' at the business end of a hissy fit.
Okay, but if you can't...no dinner!
Ooh.
I'm not gonna talk to her, she obviously got my message and is choosing not to call me. Now I'm needy and snubbed. God, I miss just being needy.
Yeah, it's almost if Air Barbados doesn't care about your social life.
Phoebe is going to say "yes"? That's, that's great!
Oh, come on! I don't care! Come on! Whose is it?
Eh, y'know what, she's to political, she probably wouldn't let you do it, unless you donated four cans of food first.
Woah, woah, I've put on a little weight?
Emotional Knapsack?
Wh-what?
It did enter my mind! But then something happened that made it, shoot right out.
What's going on?
Okay, y'know your not though. Let's go.
All right, Pheebs, back me up here, ok? You believe in that karma crap, don't you?
Oh you wouldn't uh, care. It's just a stupid comic book story.
Who's the father?
Well, y'know I'm 29. I mean who needs a savings account.
Ohhh!
Okay, so you both just know this stuff?
Hey!
What a great apology! And you accept! Okay, bye-bye!
Love what you've done with the place.
Hi Ross.
Excellent hole, Joe.
So what happened?
Yeah, oh, but I just keep picturing you rolling around with him with your cowboy boots in the air...
What? That's terrible!
So what happened?
Chandler.
Whoever stood you up is a jerk.
Oh, she's goin' somewhere.
Excuse me little one, I have a very solid backhand.
No!
They're never coming down now.
Sure you do.
Wow, you're, you're right. I have a horrible, horrible name.
Score.
Oh no-no-no, I will do it. Honey, you have to learn to sit down and relax and let your husband take care of things once and awhile. It's locked, you have to help me. Why is it locked?
Well, it's because I trust you, you're one of my best friends, and you walked in on me when I was looking at ring brochures.
My Grandmother used to say that exact same thing to me.
Great! This baby'd better to be really good.
Hey.
You, move out. Take your fruit, your stupid small fruit and GET OUT!
Just not enough to put us in the original wedding party.
Whoa, snowing out there?
I've had a very long, hard day.
A hundred and forty-five pounds.
Damn Rollos!
Good save! We're back on track, and I'm... ..chewing someone else's gum. This is not my gum. Oh my God! Oh my God! And now you're choking.
Okay, it's just that dogs make me a little uncomfortable.
I just wanted to show Monica your book.
That's the thing, see I would like to stay in the pribe of mwha-ah-libe.
How do you know?
Emma, you even know it's your birthday today? You're one! One-year-old, that's little.
Hi! Hi! You're crazy! Okay? This is Emily. Emily is straight.
I may have.
But other than that... wholesome, wholesome building.
You told him to play the boxer gay!!
First I was afraid, I was petrified.
Shovely Joe!
That's where people make number two!!
Oh it's been going on way to long now. Y'know, I mean the first time he said it we were just passing each other in the hallway, so I didn't say anything. And then the next time he said, "Hey Toby, do you want a donut?" And I-I wanted a donut. And now it's five years later, the donut's gone and I'm still Toby.
Monica...
I know! I know!
I think it's best sir.
Okay. It's not different at all, is it?
Well, don't, don't think me immodest, but, me?
Step away from the duck.
Yeah, we talked and Monica made me see that I over reacted a little bit and some things in life are more important.
No way!
So, you busy Thursday?
I just get mad when Rachel doesn't remember where we're going.
Hey, look, this name has been holding me back my entire life. Okay, it's probably why kids picked on me in school, and why I never do well with women... So, as of 4 o'clock tomorrow, I'm either gonna be Mark Johnson or John Markson.
Okay, open ours next. Open ours next!
Yeah, I know.
Me too.
Oh, this is not that bad.
Hey! I will have you know that... aah, who am I kidding. Let's call the kid Geller and let Bing die with me.
They'll never understand!
Oh, yeah! How did you meet her?
So what do you think? I want that guys genes for my kid! Those eyes, those cheeckbones!
Why would our guy be a weirdo?
Hey, big...
GET OUT NOW!!
She was not good. Not good.
Uh, credit card. Oh no! No-no, but I left my credit card with Joey. Okay, I'll go get it. You guard the ring.
Is it wrong that I was totally aroused by that?
How can I answer that when I'm pretending I don't know you?
'Kay!
We're doomed. Okay, they're gonna take 50 bucks out of our accounts for the rest of our lives. What are we gonna do?
So how come Richard's selling the place? Went bankrupt? Medical malpractice? Choked on his own moustache?
Perfect decibel.
What???
He's not gonna make it, he's stuck in Chicago.
Way to be cool, man.
Okay, hold on. Okay.
So, you stole my joke, and you stole my money.
All right listen, I have to go to the bathroom, but if the place with the big fish comes up again. I'd like know whether that's several big fish or just one big fish.
Oh. Oh, did-did-did I wake you?
Y'know, I don't know if you've ever looked up the term goofing around in the dictionary... Well, I have, and the technical definition is, two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just wanna spend more time together. But if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me, then we have to, y'know, get you my original dictionary. I am so bad at this.
Hey! Babe! Aren't you excited we're going on our honeymoon?
Not yet.
Nope, hymn 253, His Eyes Are On The Sparrow! When my parents got divorced is when I started using humour as a defence mechanism.
Are you trying to do a British accent?
Hey, what do I know? I wanted to get a bigger gorilla.
Oh, and I promise, I will not fake it this time.
Oh, yeah. But you have to give it back if I get a job. Of course, by that time in the future ties will be obsolete and we'll all be wearing silver jump suits.
Hey, is Rachel here?
Yes there are, I just saw them a few minutes ago.
So, what're you gonna do?
I have no idea.
Airplane! Airport! Airport '75! Airport '77! Airport '79!
Let me tell you why you need to pick me. See, when I was a kid, I was always left out of everything, you know, and it really made me feel... insecure. You know, I was always picked last in gym. Even behind that big fat exchange student who didn't even know the rules to baseball. I mean, this guy would strike out and then run to third. Anyway, If I'm the only one left out of this wedding, I just know that all those feelings are gonna come rushing back.
Bye, Pheebs!
Hey it's the most eligible man in NY. How's the moving on going?
Y'know, I'm so glad I picked you to help me with this.
Because, you know, you don't have to. If you want, you could just take a nap right here.
Why?
I don't see him. Do you see him?
How did you? How? How?
Hey! Here's a dollar, consider it a deposit. Please sing at our wedding.
I can't believe I did this! What an idiot!
Good-bye muscles!!
No! I just happened t'do a lot trivias about smoking in different states. For example, in Hawaii cigarettes are called Leyhallalookoos.
Anything?
Oopsey, missed it!
Hello Rachel.
Phoebe is, making people.
Well actually uh, there was something we wanted to tell you about the wedding. Um, it's going to be a small ceremony. Uh, tiny! We're not even sure why we're having it.
Hello children!
Yes that was mine.
Yeah, let's just forget it.
What?! No! No!
Really? Right across the street?
But you said you forgave me. It was just a couple of cigarettes-no big deal.
Okay! Listen, I'm gonna be moving out so you will be in charge of paying the rent.
Hey, y'know what we can do? Y'know, now that we are up? We can just like talk to each other all night long, y'know like we did when we were first going out. It'd be fun!
Weirder than watching his two moms make out?
Y'know those big-big uh, road signs that say "Merge?"
Well, it's a pretty big commitment, I mean, what if one of us wants to move out?
Here I am.
Hey! Wow, it is true what they say, pregnant bellies look like a drum.
Alright look, let's think about this, ok, do you really think that people are gonna stir up your family at this tragic time? That people are gonna post condolences on a website? This is not about people not caring that you're dead .This is about people not having a decent outlet for their grief.
No, we're still together. Yeah we went out for two summers, and then I broke up with her.
Okay, umm, we all have to play strip poker.
Oh, this is soo bad.
No, I got him.
Yeah, I think it is!
I don't know, but Donald Trump wants his blue blazer black.
Too bad, she's leaving.
I Think It's Great That You Work Here. You'Re Going To Make A Lot Of Money, And Here's Your First Tip. Don't eat yellow snow. . Ah ha ha, 2:15, coffeehouse.
Well next time ask! Or at least wait for me to ask!
Yeah, well sure, when he did it, it was funny. When I did it to my boss's hat. . . all of the sudden I have this big attitude problem.
Why don't you use ours across the hall, 'cause she...has...problems.
Well this is just sad!
The cameras? Remember last night I told you to take them?
Oh, the mixed tape.
I'm going to the bathroom now.
No I didn't!
Looking for restaurant jobs for you in Tulsa.
What's going on?
Okay. I'll be right there.
What are you doing out there?
I'm full, and yet I know if I stop eating this, I'll regret it.
Yes! Way to go, man! Still got the egg, huh?
Well, the gay community is a lot more vocal than the dead community.
Can we read it? Can you print out another copy?
What?!
Oh, yeah! RACHEL TALKS TOO!
Are you serious?! I mean like eloping?! No more stupid wedding stuff?! No more these flowers or these flowers or these flowers-Think of the money we'll save!! We're not eloping. I love the flowers. Can our wedding be bigger please?
And thats the Chrysler Building right there.
Ross, it's just a sandwich!
Oh my God!
Santa? Really?
No, just wanna make sure we're on the same page.
Oh yes, and that's what I want a roommate that I can walk around with and be referred to as the funny one.
You know I think he will be surprised, 'till he realizes he's a monkey, and uh, you know, isn't capable of that emotion.
Ya know, my cousin went to hell on a football scholarship.
Is that a problem?
Or maybe she doesn't steal stuff and Joey just slept with her and never called her back.
Your last roommate's kidney?
Good morning everyone, it's nice to see our team together for the first time. Now, before we get started, are there any questions? Yes, Ken is it?
Okay, I'll do it!
We're taking a break!
Yeah?
Well, thank you for lunch.
I don't think the contestants are supposed to speak to each other.
You know, it's very hard to take you seriously when you look like that.
Yeah. It's a shame you two didn't get to spend more time together.
Please, please, please, don't be mad at me.
Hey, buddy boy, how'd the audition go?
Wait, you guys, look!
You need new clothes.
Not exactly. . . I'm wearin panties.
You know what? You know what? I think we're making too big a deal out of this. ok? So we pay our bills a little late this month and maybe next month we cut back on a few things. And maybe we start eating out of Joey's refrigerator for a change. You're chef... what can you make out of backing soda and beer?
99...100! Ready or not, here I come! All right, let's go over the concept one more time.
Okay, I thought of the joke two months ago at lunch with Steve.
Okay.
There we go little fella.
You got it. You got Nevada twice.
Hey!
Well appealing as that does sound to her boyfriend and her brother, I can't do that we promised we'd make each other gifts this year.
I'm so tired. Yeah okay, but no foreplay.
Oh that is over!
Hey!
Well he doesn't have to know! It's not like we run in the same circles. I hang out with you guys, and he stars in a drag show in Vegas.
It's about cutting my people a little slack, ya know, for morale. Look, if you wanna see some rough numbers, I can get them to you by Wednesday.
Monica, you have got to stop this competitive thing! Okay? It's crazy. {Finally! The voice of reason.} I mean, just impress Gary and Phoebe we have to go upstairs and have sex over and over and I'm saying no to this, why? Get your coat.
What did I just say?
But I don't wanna do it in a cup!
Look I know it was a stupid reason to break up with somebody, but I was 15!
Oh, give her the deposit! Give her the ring! I don't care!
Well, I'm so confused as to what we've been doing so far...
No one was around to hear that?
Sure, why not?
What?
Hey you guys.
So she stole your pants and then she came back and wore them in front of you?
Uh, HELLO!!
Well don't you see how gross that is? I mean that's like you using my toothbrush. You used my toothbrush?
Can I just say how much I appreciate you coming with me. When we get to Tulsa I'm taking you for a great dinner at 'Slim Pickings'. 'So Cheesy'? 'Whole Hog'? It's going to be tough to keep Kosher in Tulsa.
Well, this does butch it up a bit.
I couldn't say that I was naked because she's allowed too see me naked.
No reason, except...she...told...me.
Yeah, y'know what I got a better idea. How-how 'bout it blocks none of mine door and a lot of yours?
Yes, but if it's any consolation, before the bird dropped it, he seemed to enjoy it.
I can't believe you don't know what I do for a living!
Clunkers?! Oh my god!
I... I don't know... you seem lovely.
Oh, because we love kids. Love 'em to death.Well, not actually to death, that's just a figure of speech - we love kids the appropriate amount... as allowed by law.
Okay, I'm going to go stand over there.
This is so exciting! It's so glamorous! People taking our picture. How do I look?
Hey!
If I untangle you, will you please get rid of the corn rose?
Oh, you get used to it.
Well, I think you should seriously consider the marriage thing, give Rachel another chance to dress up like Princess Bubble Yum.
All right!
I don't have a *job*! *Closing Credits*
What are you writing?
No-no-no, if you unplug it, I'll have nothing to show for my day! It would be like I was at work. No! Hey look at that! Look at that, it's still there! This thing must have some kind of primitive ROM Chip in it or something!
Oh no..don't thank me. Thank you. You know there's not one thing I would change about you? Not one single thing! And definitely not... two... single things.
Yeah, alright.
Really? That's great!
Hey!
What if I had had the guts to quit my job? I'd probably be writing for the New Yorker, getting paid to be funny. But my job's fun too! I mean tomorrow, I-I don't have to wear a tie.
Because weddings are a great place to meet women, and when I dance, I look like this...
Raymond Chandler.
Not once!
Okay, but if he asks, I'm not going to lie.
It's football... It's just football... This is great! This is the first time I've ever enjoyed football... It may be customary to get a beer... What the... What are you doing?
Oh, yes. Well it's very beautiful. It's cream-colored and tight I don't mean tight, I mean it's not too tight, not that I was looking at-
He's got nothing!
I have some moves.
Ahh yes, the messers become the messies!
You got it! Here we go! Come on! This is great! Ahhh!
Wha- wh- why, why, why does he suspect that?
Hey.
I wish there was an easier way for us to have a child but I don't think there is one.
Hey. Where've you been?
Okay!
No!
Yes I'm gonna put it back exactly where I found it.
Gee if only she were one and had no idea what the hell a birthday was!
Okay. You have to stop the Q-tip when there's resistance!
Tell it again. Seriously.
It's your timer.
I think we have some time. Have you ever heard him talk? "Uh, Phoebe, uh, I would be honoured, uh..." Spit it out, David!
Yes, Fran. I know what time it is, but I'm looking at the WENUS and I'm not happy!
Did she see us yet? Did she see us?
So what does this mean?
Okay, what do you saw I go over there and say how much I like her? No-no it'll be good, I can tell her much I've been thinking about her. That I haven't stopped thinking about her since the moment I met her. That I'm so fantastically, over-the-top, wanna-slit-my-own-throat in love with her, that for every minute of every hour of every day I can't believe my own damn bad luck that you met her first!!
Hi! Nice to meet you!
What, what are you laughing at?
Y'know when you guys said you were gonna go across the hall and look, you don't, you don't do that every year do you?
That means nothing to me. Come on!
Yeah, I'm gonna stick with the ring. Oh, this one's nice! I like this one! Sir? Uh, kind sir? Can I see this one?
I'll take her back tomorrow.
All right everybody! Just be quiet! Be quiet! Be quiet!! Pipe-pipe-pipe down! What is the matter with you people?! This woman was trying to do a nice thing for you. She was making candy so she could try to get to know all of you, and I'll bet that not one of you can tell me her name! Am I right?
Kind of? If you just kept this to yourself none of this would've happened.
Hey!
Hi.
But we should take it.
Gary, I'm here to report a crime.
No! That was a lie! See how easy that was?
No, I can't. No no, listen, I, I know how much this means to you and I also know that this is about more than just jewelry, it's about you and me and the fact that we're best buds.
Yeah, well, I miss the tip! It's the best part. It has the nail.
So you might say, the ring is irreplaceable?
I know, I, I should have talked to you first about it.
So, are you guys in the movie, or are you just really paranoid.
No!
Cupping.
Oh come on!!
There's a hair in my coffee.
Y'know what? I don't trust you with this cake anymore! And I got it first, and I'm takin' it back!
Hey, no way! Come on, this is you guys, call her and work it out.
Oh, hey.
Did I not tell *anyone* about New Year's Eve? -- Alright, look, go! Go home, okay? Merry Christmas! Go.
Diet soda.
...so then the farmer says, "That's not a cow and you're not milking it."
How can you not be wearing any underwear?
Huh? Are, uh, any of these cultures, per chance, in the tri-state area?
Okay, all right. I just spent the entire afternoon looking for a present for Kathy that would be better than the rabbit.
Neat. I'm gonna die alone.
Okay, well I won't uh, worry about this anymore then.
I happen to know a Fun Bob.
Hey, you're not him. You're you. When they were all over you to go into your father's pipe-fitting business, did you cave?
Apology accepted. Excuse us.
Do you want us to leave the room, or?
Of course I will call you. I love you.
That's insane!
What was that?
Well, I don't have to break up with her this time. We're not involved! I'm going to do a pre-emptive strike! I'm going to end it with her before it starts. My ass is like frozen!
When I was growing up I...played the one on the far left.
I can't believe it.
What a wank!
All right Mike, let's get this over with. Sudden death. Whoever wins this point, wins.
Oh, what a crappy night!
You bet I did, Ben, put it there! Well, it would have worked this time, if his hands weren't so damn small! Ho, ho, ho!
Wax the door shut, we're never leaving, ever.
Yeah it is really pricey. I mean, I freaked when I first heard the numbers.
Still broken?
Okay! Now you stay out here, and you think about what you did!!
So Dan, nurse not a doctor huh? Kinda girlie isn't it?
Listen Eddie, um, I've been thinking about our current living situation and uh, why are you smiling?
I don't know; I'm not used to girls making passes at me! ... Wait a minute... am I sexy in Oklahoma?
So you came to the room looking for Joey? Did you ever in-intend on telling me about this?
I'm never gonna find a roommate, ever.
Alright. Wow, that is one disgusting miracle.
Yes, Gunther, can I get two cups of chino, please?
Well, I'm sure you get another one at Ann Taylor's.
You mean like this?
How about the dinosaur twins in the other room? No-one is manning that wall!
Let me think. Let me think-Oh! I don't care.
I'm going to need a bigger boat.
Well, there you go.
You ok?
Ye....
Hi!
Oh no-no Joey, I am not going to tell you because I am an excellent secret keeper.
What?
Because I'm very happy for him! And you, you lucky dog!
Y'know, I-I can't really put a price on that Joe.
Hi! We're checking out of the bridal suite.
Hey Pheebs, what's up?
Oh, aaaah!
Hey, man!
Yeah, about 300 guys I went to high school with. Yeah, thanks.
Hey!
Run! Run you crazy, rich freak!
Sure!
Yes, yes, but did you see who she was dating?
Joey if you wanna punch me, go ahead, I deserve it. But I just want you to know that I would never soberly hurt you or your family, you're my best friend. I would never do anything like this ever again.
You're not even giving them a chance!
Yeah.... she's not so cute.
Bullwinkle socks. That's so sweet.
Are you all right?
Okay! So yeah, maybe we can get together umm... Can you hold for one second please? What?!
You know it?
Hi.
Yes.
Hey, how'd it go? How'd she like the gift?
And then Joey remembered something.
We're going to Everest! Okay, it would be nice to leave an ass print on Everest!
Oh, just hanging out, talkin' about uh, websites. Yeah, we saw this really interesting website about marriage and how totally unnecessary it is and how its just a way for the government to keep tabs on you.
Is that a swing?
Okay look, don't...don't be mad okay? But after I unpacked the boxes I wanted to do something nice for you, so, I-I-I cleaned the apartment. So I moved everything around and then I forgot where it, where it went back and I'm sorry, I'm very sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Oh.
Did it turn into sand?
Are we greeting each other this way now? 'Cause I like that.
So, whaddya say boys, should I call him? Well, ya know what they say. Ask your slippers a question... you're going crazy.
Just give us the cheapest room you have.
Look, we're not just messing around! I love her. Okay, I'm in love with her.
Y'know, if you listen closely, you can hear a thousand retailers scream.
Brenda a bee!
All right, look, you're not really gonna buy that are you? Don't you think you've embarrassed me enough for one day?
That's how radio stars escape stalkers.
Dee, the sarcastic sister from Whats Happening.
What?
Well believe it baby!
Phoebe found your pregnancy test in the trash.
Oh, uhm, okay, uhm, do you mind if we ask you some questions about the father?
No!
I dunno, but.. I think it's about to attack the Enterprise.
Honey, it's not the bath I enjoy, it's the wet, naked lady.
Really?
Two fours.
Ho, ho, ho, holy crap is it hot in here!
Okay, okay, but don't worry, because we also have cereals, muffins, waffles, and, jams, jellies, and marmalades. Which I'm fairly certain are the same thing.
Bye. Are you still out there?
Okay.
I can not believe that I am going out with someone that is getting divorced. I'm such a grown up.
Oh yes! Oh yes!
"Benefits lapsed."
I don't wanna know what Monica got me. Y'know? I mean, look, I'm sure she worked really hard at getting you a present, and wanting to surprise me, and you guys are gonna ruin that, and I, look we have to put these back, this is not what Christmas is about.
I always thought having a heart attack was nature's way of telling you to die! But you're not gonna die. I mean, you are going to die, but you're not gonna die today. I wish I was dead.
What are you doing?
Yeah... Well, it's a good thing we got it then.
See? Now, that's why only the little fake men are supposed to do all the kicking.
You're Spudnik.
No I didn't!
Oh, we had a lot of liquor left over from the Christmas party.
Damn those robots, they're supposed to be our faithful servants!
I don't care! I don't care!!
Okay, here's the thing. We're gonna get you some coffee and they will never know that you're drunk.
Monica! This is the Men's room! Isn't it?
It's ok, it's ok. You know what? I'll just call the agency and tell them to throw out the letter.
Alright, the truth is, I soiled myself during some turbulences.
Y'know Richard...you are a good guy.
Well, it still has to go, right?
She's amazing! She makes the women that I dream about look like short, fat, bald men!
Fine.
Good, good. Listen, heh, I dunno what Shelley told you about me, but, uh... I'm not.
Thanks.
Eh, they're both good. I generally just go with, Monica's drunk again.
Well, I'm there too!
Me too!!
I hate this thing!
They don't have those.
Give me it!
Hey, you know what, here's a thought. Why don't you stay home from work today and just hang out with me.
Oh my God. What is th... it's like a guy never lived in here. Look, you've got to be careful. This girl thing is dangerous. It's spreading already.
Hey!
So I guess we wear swimsuits in here!
Oh my God! That's why I got up too!
Wait a minute, hold the phone! You're not talking about Chuckles University?!
Yes!
Okay, is this lamp in the same place?
Look, I want those basketball seats as much as you do! Okay, but we can't leave in the small apartment after we've lived here! Didn't you ever read Flowers for Algernon?
I was not trying them out, Susie asked me to wear them.
I know that one! ...No, that's Popes into a Volkswagen.
See, I'm not bad at this fixing up thing, huh?
Yeah! Totally! Totally, and you?
I can't believe she can out run you man!
Okay! You don't think I thought of that?
Oh yeah, that looks good.
Janice, I have something I need to tell you, and I want you to let me get through it, because it's, it's, it's not gonna be easy.
Oh, I have to get married in James Bond's tux!
What if I never find someone? Or worse, what if I've found her, but I dumped her because she pronounced it "supposably"?
Honey, we're leaving tomorrow you've still got a lot of packing to do.
Man, if only you'd gotten here sooner.
Hey, y'know what, maybe we should get going. I mean what time did Chloe say we should be there?
So I have a flaw! Big deal! Like Joey's constant knuckle-cracking isn't annoying? And Ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word? And Monica, with that snort when she laughs? I mean, what the hell is that thing? ...I accept all those flaws, why can't you accept me for this?
Yes, here it comes! I'm stuck here all day, and then you come in and spend two seconds with us and then expect to go off gallivanting with your friends? Well I don't think so mister!
Uhh... Yeah sure. Click!
No. And if I did, I don't think we'd be going out. Monica, this is getting ridiculous!
You'd think that would embarrass me, but you see I'm maxed out.
Of course it is. Wow-whoa!
Oh, good!
What am I gonna do now?
Yep...
Julie Grath, my camp girlfriend.
Well, it didn't say "This is a virus"!!
I KNEW IT!!!!
Oh, I am no women, but that is one tasty dish.
It's very, very nice. Well, come here. I'm very happy were gonna have all the sex.
Noo! Oh, it's okay, it's okay, baby, baby, baby.
Shhhhhhhhh!!! I'm sorry, I thought maybe I'd make some warm milk and it would help me sleep.
Okay.
Oh my God!
You hear that? You may not be with your families, but at least it's gonna smell like ham in here.
There you go!!
Hey!
'S'why I'm dancing...
Wow! Just like in the pros.
What, what's what you mean?
Was that another question?
That's a good thing actually, because ah, he used to have me rehearse with him.
Hey.
See you later Mon.
My favorite part was when Superman flew all the Jews out of Egypt.
I don't want to say.
It was unbelievable. I-I've never met anyone like her. She's had the most amazing life! She was in the Israeli army...
It's me. I'm the other guy.
I didn't know you and Carol were getting divorced, I'm sorry.
Yes, but...
Oh! Uh, yeah! Is this a cold pizza talk or a leftover meatloaf talk?
Oh please, could she be more out of my league? Ross, back me up here.
Was his question what's more boring than him?
No, not us... Us!
Uh Joe, when it's one o'clock in the morning and you don't come by? That's okay!
Hang up, hang up. And that was a great movie! I'm so gonna get back at Ross... oh yeah, this will show him, here we go .
Yes. Yes!
How drunk are you?
Then, I don't get it.
Hey.
No! No! No! I just kissed her.
Oh, you know, I would, but that might get in the way of my lying around time.
Yeah, o-okay.
Coffee house?
No. Is there anyway, anyway you think he'll understand this?
Oh man! I am so excited-I may vomit!
Joe...
You're on in 5 Ms. Minnelli.
Hey, I can be smooth. Listen, we're a little bit in a hurry, so, if you can get us a table a little quicker, I'd appreciate it.
Relax! We'll just get her some antacids.
Listen, in the middle of everything if I scream the word, "Yippee!" just ignore me.
Hey, look, you're in trouble either way! Okay? If she comes back and sees me locked to this instead of the chair, she's gonna know you were in here. So you might as well just let me go.
All right, hold on! If you win, we give up the birds.
Wow! Why do you want to get rid of her so badly?
Now Monica, I know you're upset, but don't forget. There is going to be a wedding, you are going to throw the bouquet, and then there's going to be a honeymoon, maybe in Paris.
Yeah, I'm putting my foot down. Yeah look, when I proposed I told you that I would do anything to make you happy, and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy, then, then that's what we're gonna do.
All right, look, if you insist on wearing that, in public, y'know, you're gonna spend the rest of the afternoon all by yourself.
This is not going to work.
Yeah, now how's that going though? Are you okay with the not-flirting thing?
OK, Phoebs, your turn.
Ready?
No. He.....he's coming out of his shorts.
Well, maybe it was the kind of food that tasted good at first but then made everybody vomit and have diarrhea.
You dove in front of Ross! Ross!
Okay, absolutely!
Monica?
Wow!
Well I've-I've never done that with you before.
Monica!
When'd you meet her?
...Take off their hats!
You just, you look so different! Terrific! That dress! That body!
Hey listen, come on, Joey is having a problem! A little girl is beating him up.
I was just telling Joey about the opening in Fleischman's group.
Well...
All right, Janice, likes him. In fact she likes him so much she put him on her freebie list.
Centerpieces!
Hey.
Well, I got a job interview. It's kinda a big deal too. Its a lot more money and I'd be doing data reconfiguration and statistical factoring.
Joey you broke my chair!!
That's great, but shouldn't you be on the toilet right now?
Santa pants. Santa Claus's pants.
Oh that's not true.
Yeah. You're right. Hey I-I can do that.
Woooo!!!
Having a swim.
No, look, that's it, it's over, I want you out, I want you out of the apartment now.
Hey.
Um, we're kind of having an emergency and we-we were looking for something...
I mean, you were the most beautiful woman in the room tonight!
Yeah, I mean when you were late last night, Kathy and I got to talking, and one thing to another and...
Because it's awesome.
Who the hell is Carl?!
Y'know, how did I get this reputation as a dropper? Okay? I'm anything but a dropper.
Y'know what maybe it's gonna be okay, I mean it's been a week.
Now-now, why would you say that Joseph?
Yeah, but it was like a million years ago, so it doesn't matter.
No-no-no! It is going to be okay, because Mrs. Braverman is gonna send away for a free one and that way we all win! The only losers are the big cheesecake conglomerate, Momma's Little Bakery. I feel terrible, I'm a horrible, horrible, horrible person.
What is it?
Seriously, where did this happen?
Glass, sand, whatever.
So where are we on the whole going back to the place where they have all the marriages thing? I love you.
That's... That's was...
No, because you're not a grandmother!
Ah that's a cantelope.
Joey, wait! The ball!
There you are.
Oh, ok.
Y'know what the worse part was? I got to see what my life would be like without you. It was like It's a Wonderful Life with lap dances. Please promise that you will never leave me, that we will grow old together, and be with each other for the rest of our lives.
Yes, on a scale from 1 to 10, 10 being the dumbest a person can look, you are definitely 19.
Hey, y'know what? Why don't we think about changes we can make in the living room?
Uhh, no.
Hi, honey! I'm home!
Have you talked to him lately?
Yeah, it's beautiful.
I know.
He saw a therapist?
Yes you did! You look happy and sick; you smoked!
The one that doesn't.
Does for me.
Oh yes! Bye Bye Birdie, starring Joseph Stalin. Joseph Stalin is the Fiddler on the Roof.
Oh no, you see, actually it is.
I'm telling you, she gives the worst massages ever!! Okay, it was like she was torturing me for information. And I wanted to give it up I just-I didn't know what it was!
You know, you always cook this meal all by yourself. Let me help this year.
Hey Phoebs, can I have the milk after you?
I'm just saying that sometimes we like to do stuff that costs a little more.
Yeah, like in a cab...
This is exactly the kind of social situation that I am not comfortable with!
Oh Mon-Mon-Mon-Mon-look, this is the honeymoon suite. The room expects sex. The room would be disappointed if it didn't get sex. All of the other honeymoon suites would think it was a loser.
Well, Chandler will be there for you too. I mean, well, he might be a little late, but-but, he'll be there. And he'll bring you some cold soda, if want you need him for is that you're really hot.
Yeah, she was at Rockefeller Center skating with her husband, she looked so happy. I almost feel bad for whipping that kid's pretzel at them.
Thank you, Mister Drunken Gambler! Okay, you get this and uh, we get the biggest suite in the place! Wait-wait-wait-wait! We get the biggest suite in the place.
Well, I can't say "hump" or "screw" in front of the B-A-B-Y.
Hi Emma! It's the year 2020. Are you still enjoying your nap?
Hello? Is someone on the line?
Oh, well give me the phone then.
Kinda like Joey.
But we're not ready to tell yet!
Y'know what? I can't believe this! Do you know what you did? My girlfriend is out there thinking things over! You made my girlfriend think!!
That, that's what's stupid.
Well, I don't know what Big Leon told ya but it's an even thousand if you want me for the whole night. What is this for?
Ok.
Oh, and Ive got Earth Science, but I'll catch you in Gym.
OK, I don't, I don't mind the last pound. OK, in fact I kind of like the last pound. OK, so don't make me do anything that I'll regret.
That was amazing.
But, those are for you.
To yourself. Hey-hey-hey, y'know what that's pretty good.
I see, but once you get your first paycheck you'll be springing a big hotel suite, right? I mean, lead in a movie, they must be paying you a lot?
Huh.
What we did last night was....
And I'll be using his dead body as a shield.
Yeah, well, I don't dance at weddings.
Oh, well someone left this . This is yours?
I know, I can do this.
I just have to know, okay. Is it my hair?
That guy's going home with a note!
Oh my God!
Okay we have to do something about your breath.
Is everybody else seeing a troll doll nailed to a two by four?
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow. Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow. . She's insane, the woman is insane. It's before work, it's after work, it's during work. She's got me doing butt clenches at my desk. And now, they won't bring me my mail anymore.
Yes you can. You're thinking about time, you can't go back in time.
But are you sure you can do this?
Yes!!
Funniest? Heckles?
Honey, we've been over this. I need to be facing the other way.
You don't know. You didn't see it.
Well, that's impossible, can you check again, please?
I've been taking dancing lessons.
So take care.
We'll take a brief time out while Messier stops to look at some women's shoes.
So y'know, uh, when's he getting back?
Dinner is at four, we'll never gonna make it back.
Wouldn't that be Frank the III?
Okay.
Yeah, didn't he tell ya?
But it's Ross.
Well.... it is amouz-ing...
Definitely roses. Well, I just think they're a little more weddingy. But Lilies are the clear choice.
Did you tell her what we talked about?
Of course he has this big huge dog! That uh, barks into the night. Well, who doesn't love dogs? Ah, he's a tap dancer! Yes, some would say that is a lost art. He's a pimp! There you go! Yes, he's a pimp. He's a big, tap dancing pimp! Hello?
You are gonna be a huge star! I'm gonna hug ya!
Bing doesn't seem so weird now, does it?
There is nothing like the support of your loving wife, huh?
Well, I could make it seem like he's here. "Here's some little known facts about cous-cous. They didn't add the second cous until 1979."
Y'know sometimes the good ideas are just right in front of you, aren't they?
I know.
Well, you got here just in time. I really have to go buddy.
What happened?!!
Oh I used too, but then Joey thought it would be fun to go to Central Park and hit rocks at...bigger rocks. Hey Rach, do you have a tennis racquet?
They're terrific, and they live right here in the city.
You think?!
Okay, but this is the last time. With a chick-chick here, and a chick-chick there. Here a chick, there a chick, everywhere a chick-chick--chickeeeen.
Well, if the magician can open my beer with his but cheeks, then all right.
Hey Eddie. Daahh!! What're you doin' here?
Uh, yeah.
You know, our band is playing on Friday.
And the fireplace in the bedroom.
No, actually Laurie's a boy.
Jeez, man did you fall.. Hi! So ah, did ya, did-did-did ya fall high?
But only because I was up all night worried about this meeting, ain't that funny? Irony? Not a fan, alright . See, here's the thing. I went home and told my wife about Tulsa and she won't go. See, me, I love Tulsa! Tulsa is heaven! Tulsa is Italy-Please don't make me go there!
Okay!
So you uh, want to do something tonight?
Absolutely! Y'know, because touchie can mean both ass and good worker.
Are you really that busy?
I love you, St. Valentine.
WENUS. Weekly Estimated Net...
Now why would she say that's embarrassing?
I can't even believe this! I really come off that badly?
But I didn't get to shake my belly like a bowl full of jelly.
Lowell? Financial Services' Lowell, that's who you saw me with?
Ok, who wants light cheese, and who wants dark cheese?
Oh, uh, he's not here right now, uh, I'm Chandler, can I take a message, or, or a fishtank?
I'll be in there.
And that became 'they are humid prepossessing Homo Sapiens with full sized aortic pumps...?
Alright, ok, alright. So I can't fire Joseph but uh, I can sleep with his wife.
Bladder Control Problem Stop Wife Beating Hemorrhoids? Winner of 3 Tony Awards...
And we're changing.
Okay, I gotta ask, who calls us that?!
...Hm.
Well, my secretary is gonna be out for a couple of weeks. She is having one of her boobs redused. It's a whole big boob story.
...Quality, right, great.
No, our guy is just a floating head.
Yeah that was great. That was really great! But to tell you the truth, I'm more excited about where we are right now.
Oh that's too bad.
Oh God! What was it? The thing that we hardly ever do or the thing we never do?
Sorry!
You're going down.
Here you go Phoebe! Here you go Phobo! Phewbedo! Phaybobo.
I figure that $1,500 would cover him for a few months, y'know? But I have to trick him into taking it so I won't hurt his pride.
Hey!
And so young.
I'll tell you what, for the rest of our lives, I'll be careful until told otherwise. hey wait a minute this isn't the china we picked out..
Now that you live next door, we can be together every day. Sid and Monica never have to know a thing.
Yeah alright. What're these, raisins?
So, are you really gonna go out with that nurse man?
Hello, Chandler Bing.
Yeah!
Yes, that is cool. Because I have models here y'know......never.
Joe?
Thank you, sir.
No, really you're gonna freeze.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you! And you are about to marry a wonderful man! Hey! I'm marrying a dead woman!
Is he the one with the beautiful wife?
Hi. You guys have any wrapping paper?
In a foreign, romantic country...
That's me.
One more score to go! You can do it!
People who've never ever been to Paris.
Then what?
What?!
And we just sit here. I mean if I die the only way people would even know I was here, would be by the ass print on this chair! Look, we have to do something. Okay? Something huge!
Yeah, well look at this kitchen, slash bathroom. Well that's great! Y'know so you can cook while in the tub.
Okay.
Okay, you guys spend waaaay too much time together.
Okay.
No.
You are really frightening me.
God?
Who sold a story to Archie Comics?!
Okay!
Gunther, can I get another cup of coffee, please? So uh, what do you do when you're not working here?
Hey, he's not crying.
What are you, what are you gonna show me my clothes?
Come on, let me see that smile.
Hey, relax I just need more time. We're going to dinner tonight.
Really? Oh What A Beautiful Morning! Surrey With A Fringe On Top.
Oh, he works in the Fine Foods division.
Joey's a sex addict.
Sorry!
Oh, what's the matter?
Awful. Awful. Couldn'ta gone worse.
Eh!
What's the matter?
Ahh, I think it just moved. It's really poking me.
Y'know, it'll be okay. It'll be okay. Because when they come over, I will be all charming, I will make them fall in love with me, and then we'll tell 'em.
Listen, in the middle of everything if I scream the word, "Yippee!" just ignore me.
You may wanna get some more of those too.
Last time I do that, I promise.
Well, at least the perfume is not mine, be thankful for that!
Treeger's snaking the shower drain.
We have to get out of here, baby!
Wh-wh-why?!
Joey, it's been three days, okay.. Your just a little homesick, Okay. Would you just try to relax. Just, just try to enjoy yourself.
Ba dum bumb cheshhh!
Yes.
It doesn't matter. I just don't want to be one of those guys that's in his office until twelve o'clock at night worrying about the WENUS.
Uhh, a T-shirt that says, "I don't belong here."
Had it.
Hey, Pheebs!
Surprise!!
I will have one.
Hey Mon, I think I figured out whose handcuffs they are.
Look, it really is gonna be okay. The important thing is that we love each other and that we're gonna get married.
Okay.
Cry?! I just found a talking puppy, I'm rich!
You're right, I know.
Oh, it's gonna be okay.
Janice. Hi, Janice. Ok, here we go. I don't think we should go out anymore. Janice.
This is unbelievable. Its been like a half an hour. If this was a cartoon, youd be looking like a ham right about now.
Okay.
Ahh yes, the messers become the messies!
Hey, you have got to try this cheesecake.
Yeah. And what you're doing feels so good.
Sorry Phoebe.
But we don't do that.
Y'know what, he's right. There's something like uh, ammonia in that, that like kills the pain.
Is not.
And here is the bottle of wine for you to bring over tonight. You were also going to buy Monica flowers but you couldn't afford it, because you paid dinner last night.
David, I'm pretending to read here!!
Hey Mon, how's it going?
Out loud?
What do you want from me, I've never met the guy. So anyway, Rachel, I'm sorry you can't stay, but the rest of us have a lot of work to do. What are you doing? All right, listen, I've got to wake up!
Oh yes! Just had me a little nubbin-ectomy. Yep! Two nipples, no waiting.
Stupid, useless Canadian money!
Honey, I'm gonna save you some time, 200 CDs, not one of them in the right case.
Look at this. Pictures of all the women that Heckles went out with. Look what he wrote on them. Vivian, too tall. Madge, big gums. Too loud, too smart, makes noise when she eats. This is, this is me. This is what I do. I'm gonna end up alone, just like he did.
It's happened to you?
All right! That's fine! That's fine! I won't bring over the chairs! I won't bring anything over! I wouldn't want to ruin the ambiance over here at Grandma's place!!
I totally understand. Can I just see your bra?
You wanna play?
What?! What-what is it?!
Y'know when we move in together, can I get a gumball machine?
Oh. Oh, God!
Eddie, do you remember yesterday?
Look out kids, he's coming!
What?
You left a shoe here?!
Thanks!
You're right, by saying "nice" I'm virtually licking her.
No. No, I won't. Do you know why I took all those lessons? See, for the first time I didn't want you to be embarrassed to be seen on the dance floor with some clumsy idiot.
Nobody is opening anything ok? Look, I don't know about you guys, but I wanna see the look on Monica's face when I give her my present, and I'm sure she wants to see the look on my face when I get mine. So please, please, can we just, can we put them back?
You know what I just realized? We have no idea what we're doing in the wedding tomorrow.
Why? Why-why-would you-Wh-why... Look, I just don't want you to think that we're animals who do it whenever we want.
It's not something to be proud of, okay? You have to go to a sleep clinic!
I'm sorry, is this a game for Emma or for Monica?
Sure you do.
Who are those people?
Well, whatever it is, I hope it involves winking.
Sense the tone! No that kid Nate got it.
I'll make something up! I'm good at lying, I actually did borrow your Walkman!
Eleven days before Halloween.. all the good costumes are gone?
All right, kids, I gotta get to work. If I don't input those numbers,... it doesn't make much of a difference...
Why would I kiss a girl, and then put her on your bed?
Okay, but be careful okay, because I wanna get our security deposit back.
What is it?
Look guys, I know it's a little steep.
Believe me, I've been saying that for years. Oh my God!
What are you doing?!
It's a buffet man.
Yes?
Apparently my sperm have low motility and you have an inhospitable environment.
Oh they didn't want to come!
Oh my... God?
Come on, he won't even know what they mean.
Let me get this straight. I called yesterday trying to cancel my reservation and I was told it was not refundable, then we drove six hours all the way up here and now you tell me that we don't have a reservation?
Yeah, you wish.
Hey!
This is okay. We're all adults here; there's nothing to be ashamed of. Now, let's put our underwear in our pockets and walk out the door.
Hey, we're having some fun now, huh, Ross? Wanna do another one, huh Russ? OK... eleven letters, atomic element number 101... ends in ium.
It just doesn't...feel like we're breaking up.
Noo!! You don't have a boyfriend because....I don't, I don't know why you don't have a boyfriend. You should have a boyfriend.
Hi! How'd it go?
I - I don't think I can.
Why don't you just give him to somebody else?
It was the ring!
Well, it certainly worked for that Valdez kid.
We really...didn't get a chance to...
We came over as soon as we saw.
I always liked you, Ken.
And here we go...
I didn't know you had another level.
That's right! I do! And I'm your man. And I'm going to get us through this situation even if it means you working twice as hard.
Congratulations!/Good for you!/Great!
Yeah, and at the end of the play, he, he got up y'know, and he just started like, banging his hands together!
Remember that really cold morning, you woke up and those dogs were licking your face?
I'm gonna ask Monica to marry me.
Uh yes, but uh, I just watch it for the articles.
Okay, I'll give them back. Look! What is so great about that sandwich?
The Bings have horrible marriages! They yell. They fight. And they use the pool boy as a pawn in their sexual games!
Hey, listen, I'm sorry about this afternoon, y'know, if I would've known you guys were... I never would've...
No we didn't!
Well, I feel like a snack!
Look, we're not just messing around! I love her. Okay, I'm in love with her.
I can't believe there is a naked hooker in there!
What?
No, no, no.
All right, let's play one more hand! One more!
See my friend-my friend, Rachel, she wants to be set up.
You're right, I have no excuses! I was totally over the line.
If marriage worked, I'd be all for it. But do you know what the divorce rate in this country is? 97%.
Aww, turkey! Aww, giving thanks! Aww!
Couldn't I just say, "This is Ross?"
Hey, do you want this done quick, or do you want this done right?
Well, we're talking about sperm donors and Zack may be the guy! I mean, look, he's intelligent, he's healthy, he's athletic, I mean, he is "spermtastic"!
She has a real name.
Yeah you are!!
Yeah, I'd love to but I've tried that so many times they won't even let me in the store anymore.
Well, I'm not really in a sexy mood right now.
Yeah, I know. She makes me happy.
Some girl...!?
Jeez, what a baby.
Here we go. Okay, brace yourselves.
Still on Amelia Earhart?
Well, I guess there's nothing left for us to do but-but kiss.
No, he visited a little town south of throw up. So what was Phoebe's secret?
All right, check it out. Check this out. It says here that there's a place you can go to rent videos of all the museums! "It's almost as good as being there."
I-never borrowed your Walkman.
Oh no-no-no! Stay! Stay! Because you-you should you-you-you should stay!
Then why-why is she going to a play?!
Hello.
What are doing? You know I can only dish it out!
And you're okay with that?
No, we'll-we'll bring it back! Just put it under your dress.
Okay.
Okay, one question.
No! In his office! How many kisses were there?
Oh! Worm medicine for the duck.
How's it going?
He just said, "No strippers."
I hit her in the eye! I hit her in the eye! This is the worst break-up in the history of the world.
Hey Pheebs!
Would you tell her I let you win please?
But, I never left the room!
You can't move at all?
You are a frightening, frightening man.
Where the hell is everybody? Bitter lady: Why don't you like me?! Chapter One: My first period.
No, no, I'm just looking for a man to draw on me with chalk.
You didn't see how mad he was, y'know?
Four hours? You guys have been doing this for four hours?
You wanna talk about people's feelings? You should have heard how hurt professor Stern was yesterday when I told him I wouldn't be able to go with him to Key West!
Yay!
Yeah, listen, how cold is it going to be there? Do I need a coat or will all these sweater vests be enough?
Look, you know what? If this is the way you feel, then maybe you should take it.
Hey! Wow! You look great! Wanna move in with me tomorrow?
Hey honey, you got the kind with the little girl, you said we were gonna to get the kind with the baby.
Sure, you guys don't have this problem, you're made of wood. Hey!
And basically, that's how a bill becomes a law.
We talked 'til like two. It was this perfect evening... more or less.
What a minute, I know that hat! I was taken aboard that hat! They did experiments on me! I can't have children!!
Spanish midgets. Spanish midgets wrestling. Julie. Ok, yes, I see how you got there.
Are you serious?
Okay uh, for now, temporarily, you can call me, Clint.
Me, that guy who just said butt cracks?
Okay, but you gotta push past this because it is about to get so good!
Turns out he is kinda funny.
Well where... Where did she go?
The front page? You really do live in your own little world, don't ya?
HA-HA! All you got was Monica's stinky Brussels sprouts!
Seven times!
Look, I'm just gonna be across the hall, we can still do all the same stuff.
Here in Chelsea.
So tell me, how do- how do you think your husband would feel about you sitting here with me?...Sliding your foot so far up my pant leg you can count the change in my pocket?
Hey.
Well, if it helps there were only three. So it would just be for tonight, right?
Air hole! Air hole!!
No, the thing was, we were gonna go see Hootie and the Blowfish.
We actually missed it.
Hey.
What stupid thing did you do?
Elizabeth Hornswoggle?
What?!
All right, fine, you know what, we'll both sit in the chair. I'm soooo, comfortable.
Do we pay for this?
That's why for an entire year people called me Sir Limps-A-Lot?!
To the bathroom!
Seven times!
Ooh-hoo. Very hot, very sexy. But ah, y'know she's too international, y'know she's never gonna be around.
I-kea! This is comfortable.
Dum! Dum-dum-dum! Dum! Dum! Dum! Dum-dum-dum!
Come on, pick up, pick up! Hello? Transit Authority? Yes, hello. I'm doing research for a book, and I was wondering what someone might do if they left a baby on a city bus. Yes I do realize that would be a very stupid charact er.
Hey.
Great! Now, we can go to the Ranger game! Last night!
Ok. Ok. Having a phone has finally paid off.
It is. Did I... not tell you about her?
Yeah! No! No! No! Don't fall asleep! Okay, I am going to make you some coffee. And I probably won't spill coffee grounds all over the kitchen floor.
Okay.
What?
What!?
Okay, well, then, I-I have to go to the bathroom.
Yes, I do. Now, I may not understand why you have to win so badly, but if it's important to you then it's important to me, because I love you.
OK that's not what he was doing. Alright, he was looking for his bus money.
And weenie number two has it. Unless, of course, nine-down, Knights in White Satin was sung by the Doody Blues.
Okay, uh, how about, how about-y'know what? We could play a new game. A new game, it's fun.
Okay! I was gonna wait 'til uh, it was official y'know? But I got so excited I just had to tell you guys because you're my best friends.
You can be the best man when I get married.
Yeah I gotta say thank you, I was really nervous. Y'know I've been told I come on to strong, make to many jokes, and then it was really hard to sidestep that duty thing. Duties. Duties! Poo.
Oh yeah?
Can we start over?
Hi.
Janice was my safety net, ok? And now I have to get a snake.
So it did go well.
I've got good news!
The guy was hammered, okay? There's no way, you look like Ross's mother.
Good luck!
Again true.
Ahh, Merry Christmas; I miss you guys!
Really?
Yeah, I remember.
Is this a service you're providing me?
Man, I gotta get a kid.
Well this one's for you.
Well, y'know two regulars. And ah one that barely qualifies as... Ahh, what?
That thing, it's a uhh. . . yeah it's, it's a little flashy.
Uh, could you leave me one?
All right. I've got a plan. I'll go down the fire escape.
And you're gonna make them all disappear.
...And what did you bring?
Nope, not this time.
I'm not in a meeting. I'm right... Whoops.
Hey that's what I tell girls about me.
Take whatever you want, just please don't hurt me.
"Smoke away."
What are you singing?
On every word?
What?
That's the perfect amount!
I'm gonna call and get off work tomorrow!
Y-Y-YEEESSS! Make "groom" for Chandler.
Okay.
Yes! Yes, but I can only pay $8,000.
Yeah, I know what you're thinkin'! Yes, yes, your breasts are just as firm and juicy.
Yeah.
Oh the phone! The phone's making sounds! Hello!
Okay, I'm a rookie. I should not be in the end zone.
What's this in my pocket? Why it's Joey's porno movie.
Hey, mister tux!
Okay, give me a chance to win my money back. Okay? Sudden death, one goal, $1,000.
Yeah!
And?
Really? You got us a chick and a duck?
Ahh...
So how are you doing?
What?
No?
Hey Gar!
It's like a baby caterpillar chasing its mama!
I got the time to get to know Julie.
Oh yeah, I had no idea the amazing journey you go through as a woman! Tell me, tell me about your first period!
Hey! Hey Adrienne.
Well, what is it?
Ahh, so how many cameras are actually on you?
No, no, you don't have to see.
Okay.
Me too.
Phoebe knows about us!
By me?
You think we're ready for something like that?
It's gonna be ok. You know that?
Was the setting of Phoebe's triumph.
Well, I have some.
Then you distract her with a Barbie doll.
I'm sorry, he's a little bit wound up, we had to stop at every maple candy stand on the way here.
Oh yeah! Yeah, so you-you bumped into Richard! You grabbed a bite! It's no big deal.
Hungry monkey.
Life-sized Imperial Storm Troopers from Sharper Image?
Well, last time I saw him he was heading out the door with the bride's maid and a bucket of strawberries. So uh, you're not still upset about what that guy told ya are ya?
Yeah, I'm cool. Casual.
See, this is the brilliance of the show. I say always keep them running. All the time, running. Run. Run Yasmine, run like the wind.
Well, this is much better.
I KNEW IT!!!!
Because it's flattering! Come on Monica! Come on Monica!
Umm ma'am, do you have a minute? I kind of have some bad news. I don't think I can move to Tulsa.
My wife and I have some boundary issues, you know, sometimes we ask inappropriate questions. We're working on it.
Hey, listen, why don't we go change in my room?
Good, God's speed, good people! You're not gonna go?
We can't accept this.
I married Fred Sanford!
What did you do when they found out?
Hey, I'm going for sushi does anybody want.. Whoa-whoa, somebody missed the off ramp.
What about him?
What?! Why did you do that?
I so am.
Maybe I should quit and get a job that pays.
I can't believe you didn't tell me! You know that the two pillars of marriage are openness and honesty!
Oh that makes me feel so warm in my hollow tin chest.
Believe me, sometimes that happens.
Well, it does not ring a bell with me...
Hey! This is where your hyper-organized-pain-in-the-ass stuff pays off!
All right, Ross, I just have to do one thing, really quickly, it's not a big deal. GET UP!!
Oh no-no-no!
Listen, I-I'm gonna grab a beer.
Hey, guys! Come on! You gotta see what Emma just did.
I'm getting dressed.
Pierce Brosnan?
Ok, Janice. Janice. You gotta give me Janice. That wasn't about being picky.
You think?
Nah-uh! I know you! Okay? I know the thoughts that you have in the head--in your head!
We are bad people.
Well, so why not go knock?
We used them as pillows when we went camping.
We are on our honeymoon.
Okay, so how bummed were you when the second sister died huh?
You're obviously not their favorite pet.
Oh good, when he comes back for his keys, I'll be sure to give him your shoe.
I invented the game of Cups as a way to give Joey money.
Oh well, we don't because we got...the...other pl-place.
How can I not be upset? Okay? I finally fall in love with this fantastic woman and it turns out that she wanted you first!
He's taking off her coat!
Uh-huh!
Not a lot of closet space, but he can just hang his stuff out the window in a bag!
Well then, how do you know when vegetables are done?
Well, I'm sorry Joe. I didn't think the doctor was gonna buy that it just *fell* out of the socket.
Well, I'm guessing he wants to do a little dance. . . ya know, make a little love. . . well pretty much get down tonight.
You got waaaay too much free time.
How long have we been home?
All right buddy, time to roll over. No-no! No, no-n-n-n-no!! You are going to a clinic! You're going to a clinic, and a pyjama store!
Bob!
Uh-oh.
I can't smell your sandwich?
Our new fridge? I don't live here anymore.
I did! But the store wouldn't take her back! So then I took her to the shelter, and you know what I found out?
Do I smell essential oils?
Maureen Rosilla.
Hey. Soaps? Shampoos? Are you really taking all this stuff?
Well maybe you should put some ice on it.
No actually, I was just going for colorful.
Noo!! I don't care! I'm not, I'm not gonna playing one-on-one strip poker with you for practice!
This is bringing out a lovely color in you!
Well, listen, this has been great but I'm officially wiped.
Twenty percent is a pretty generous tip Joe.
Well, uh, we can talk about that too Pheebs.
So, who's up for a big game of Kerplunk?
Y'know what Gunther, go ah, go ahead, I'm-I'm talking to ah, . This is the part where you say your name.
I stole Monica's and changed the name.
What happened?
Aww, man!
Calm down? Calm down? You set me up with the woman that I've dumped twice in the last five months!
I said it first, bro.
What?!
I don't know!
Oh, okay Ross. Listen, this pen is kinda getting boring, so can you pick me up some porn?
I personally could have a gallon of Alan.
Was it like a sneeze only better?
What?
Y'know what else I can't believe? I had to kiss Phoebe and Rachel every time I left a room, I mean it's too bad they didn't see us having sex.
Hey, how was your breakfast with Hillary?
You have to really wanna see it.
You hear that? We're the guys.
What are the odds? What are the odds?
Hey, y'know, I have had it with you guys and your cancer and your emphysema and your heart disease. The bottom line is, smoking is cool, and you know it.
Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas!
B-bye!
Uhh. You are welcome.
Ah! Ahh!! Ahh!!
Okay.
Hi, oh hi.
Yes! Good thing we have that, 'Not in New York' rule.
All right, ready?
All right fine, don't do anything, just sit here and talk to us, meanwhile she is talking to him about you. And he's being Mr. Joe Sensitive, and she starts thinking 'Maybe this is the guy for me, because he understands me.'
Eh?
Hey.
Nooo.
You hear that! That is her chose, mister I'll let you have her! I win! You suck! I rule all! A mini-wave in celebration of me!!
Chicks don't swim.
Look, I understand, but I have to put my foot down. Okay? The answer is no.
Actually, me too.
Oh yeah, there-there she is!
Actually, uh, we're both the father.
Actually what?
There are snow cones! Snow cones! Yuck!
Why did you get me this?
Great.
Okay.
Next time, can I say breathe?
It's a dog.
You did look like an idiot.
Yeah.
Well I didn't think that was serious. Ya know I thought that was just a fight.
Let it go!!
Okay, thanks... They passed. They said they wouldn't go a penny under the asking price.
You okay?
The fact that you'd even ask that question shows how little you know me.
Oh? Did somebody miss me? Is there a child to raise poorly?
Yeah, I think I do! Y'know what? You move in with her! You move in with her right now! Maybe I should in with Monica!
Well what did it do?
Bullies, big bullies.
I'm afraid I can't let you do that, Joe.
Hey!
Nice work my friend.
I have no idea.
There it is! So what're you gonna do?
You kidding? You're the most beautiful woman in most rooms... Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What's going on? You and I just made out! You and I are making out?
Your family name is Tribbiani.
Uh, the book?
No-no, that's okay, apparently there's a new policy where we don't have to share everything with everybody.
That's funny. Does it-does it hurt? Does the labor hurt?
Well, I just thought it'd make me feel good to do something nice for my friend.
Yep! From now on its gonna be the four of you guys and me and the misses. The little woman. The wife. The old ball and chain.
All right! Ten buck! Fork it over! Cough it up! Pay the piper! Gimme it.
Joey?
FREE PORN!!!
That's great.
What?
That's easy, baggage claim.
Yes. Yes, thanks for letting me use your phone... and for saving my life.
Oh-hey-hey-hey! There you are!
Hm-hmm, I told you! I can't believe that I've only got two hours before I call in sick for work.
That is a bad interview.
Yeah, yeah, I think it looks pretty good. I was a little worried I was uncovering a birthmark right aboutthere, but it turned out to be a little piece of chocolate.
Hey!
Okay, will you just go help her change please!
Listen ah, Joe, I-I need to, I need to talk to you about something.
Hey, you just wanna forget about raquetball and hang out here?
Sorry.
And this from the cry-for-help department. Are you wearing makeup?
Y'know what? You can say goodbye to the tan ones.
Lose the other guys.
I know.
Oh my God!
Oh my God, what's up?!
I love you!
Okay.
What was tonight?
When did that happen to you?!
That's a bad duck!!! How'd the thing go tonight, Ross?
All right, let me in.
Oh hey, it's, it's terriffic. I mean it's a regular space... fest.
Oh, oh, c'mon in.
Yeah. Solid effort. Solid effort.
You're welcome, sweetheart.
Big picture please! So I was in the gift shop, and that's when I uh, saw this. New York.) Yeah, y'know what? I thought anything that can fit into this, can't be scary.
So you know this leaves us with...
See that's where I think that you're wrong. We've been playing these babies man for man; we should really be playing a zone defense.
How... exactly are you pursuing that? Y'know other than sending out resumes like what, two years ago?
Thank you! All right, I gotta go unpack.
Whoa-heeeiiiiii-iiiii-ah!! Huh.
Well, Kathy's last boyfriend was Joey.
What did you just do?
Umm, this is nice.
Look Eddie, aren't you forgetting anything?
What's the matter Joe?
Hello. It's Gandolf!!! So, are you in town? Oh, well, well maybe next time then.
I do! Want a hint? huh? "I do" "I do".
Wait a minute, wait. You're telling me this actress person is the only woman you ever wanted who didn't want you back?!
And was the curse lifted?
Are there no conscious men in the city for you two?
Okay, one thing at a time.
It's alright. Is she good-looking?
No, no, I keep trying, y'know? I can get out, "Joey, I have too..." but then I lose my nerve and I always finish with, "...go to the bathroom." He may think I'm sick.
Look, Monica...
Yeah. Just let me grab my jacket and tell you I had sex today.
Yeah, all right.
Oh my God! Who's gonna watch that?!
Next time?
Oh, I'm packing. Y'know I'm-I'm packing 'cause I'm moving to Yemen tomorrow.
Boy did we make friends with the wrong sister!
But then later that night...
Yeah, yeah right over there.
Nothing, just your overcoat sounds remarkably like Brent Mussberger.
Refill?
Joey!
Yes.
Oh, my god, I'm so sorry. Are you ok?
What?
Okay, hating this.
Should I use my invisibility to fight crime or for evil?
It was working until you showed up, you big tree! I mean, this isn't fair. You had your chance with her! You had your chance and you blew it! And this is my chance and I am not going to blow it because we are meant for each other! And this is all just been one stupid mistake! I was gonna propose tonight.
I saw you checking me out during the game last night.
See ya.
Wait a minute, wait a minute, you don't like the guy Rachel's dating? Well, that's odd.
Well, she's aware when we leave the room. She may notice if we start... canoodling in it.
Yeah. We don't feel like we can host Thanksgiving this year.
Oh come on, by age seven kids have already seen orgies. Was it just me?!
Big dog?
Well, before we answer that, I think we should address the more important question. How dumb are you?
Yes, and his father invented that magnetic strip on the back of credit cards.
I'm Chandler. Hey, I was in the scouts too.
Is it--?
Oh, is that against the rules?
Now, there is a dress laid out on your bed. Okay, you're doing great. You're doing great. You're doing fine.
Nine.
I know.
Well then why can't I see it?
Hey.
Stop it! You're killing me! I think I just moved on to Phase Four!
Y'know what? You should go to my guy, because when I went in there with my third nipple. He just lopped it right off. Y'know? So I guess I'm lucky. I mean not as lucky as people who were born with two nipples.
I am mad! But you know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna forgive you! Because that's what friends do! They forgive their friends when they do everything you just said, all on the list there. Well, but I want you to remember that I forgave you.
Yeah, Karen. I'm thinking about having an affair with her. Oh, you know what? I just did.
Buddy?
Wait a minute, is she going for spring vacation or is she going for spring break?
And I'm sure we're all very excited that Ross and Emily are getting married at Montgomery Hall. I mean to think, my friend getting married in Monty Hall. Ohh, come on!! Monty Hall!! Lets make a Deal!! Come on, you people!! All right, forget it!! Congratulations, Ross and Emily.
You look great. I'm so glad we're having this rehearsal dinner, you know, I so rarely get to practice my meals before I eat them.
Well, let me see... I-I believe I'm... yes, falling asleep in front of the TV.
So is he housetrained or is he gonna leave little bathroom tiles all over the place? Stay. Good, STAY! Good fake dog.
Oh that's not true! That's not true! I got her that backpack and she loved it! I remember how much she was crying the day when that big dog ran off with it... Oh, there was no big dog. All right this sucks! I already got her this briefcase, and I had R.G. put on it... Her initials...
Oh, great. This is just...
The ball is Janice. The ball is Janice.
No. No, I just think that maybe I-I'd heard it somewhere before.
Yeah, it is the best.
We can't do that that's insane. I mean 'A' he could wake up and 'B' y'know, let's go for it.
Look, Monica...
Y'know, it's been a while since we've screamed something. Maybe we should.
Finally, I figure I'd better answer it, and it turns out it's my mother, which is very-very weird, because- she never calls me!
He pulled a quarter out of my ear!
Oh no-no-no, no more offers. You can't offer anything to us!
From a bullet!
Ah, Kim Basinger, Cindy Crawford, Halle Berry, Yasmine Bleeth, and ah, Jessica Rabbit.
No problem roomie.
I was not ready for this today!
See ya. Goodbuy you fruit drying psychopath. So you want me to help you unpack your stuff?
Yes, but I don't think life experience with these.
It's great. Maybe tomorrow we can rent a car and run over some puppies.
I'm sorry! Hey-hey Joe, why don't you uh, lift up your shirt? Take a look at this kiddo. We have a crying child! Roll the damn cameras!
Y'know, I uh.. just thought I'd throw this out here. I'm no math whiz, but I do believe there are three girls and three guys right here.
Yeah, I'm not sure I can do that.
Nancy Thompson's getting fired!
Ok, Monica, only dogs can hear you now, so, look, the door's open. Here we go.
See, that's why we don't let her play.
That's what I was doing too.
Y'know Pheebs, it's kinda our anniversary.
This is the best game ever!!!
What?
I don't know.
Something so sweet and...disturbing about that.
Oh yes, yes... let me... take your coat.
Yes, he is!
Janice's birthday is coming up, I want to get her something speacial. Come in here with me.
I don't know what it is, I just can't take a good picture.
Well Joey, I'm a headhunter. I hook up out of work Soviet scientists with rogue third-world nations. Hi Rasputin!
Where is Emily?
I just want you to know that what you witnessed in there, that wasn't for fun.
Well ah, ........y'know.
Thanks Joey, that's a good idea.
No I'm serious, we should tell each other everything. I do not have any secrets from you.
Mine was a humdinger.
Bye!
Huh! So that's what I would look like if I worked out... and was being serviced by a policeman. You're not actually going to send these out are ya?
I know, but just let me say it.
The hot chicks?
Oh what is it honey, you need some tea? Some soup? Oh-ohhhh!
Joey, a woman just stuck her tounge down my throat, I'm not even listening to you.
Yes, I am!
Two!
I have a weird feeling about this place. How do I know that they are not gonna secretly videotape me and put it all over the internet.
Uhh, yes, absdolutely, um. Why again?
Okay, it's just weird! Okay? I don't want to be standing their saying my vows and then having the mental image of you and Monica! I-I-I need...I don't know what I need. I need a walk.
Joey just called. He's got courtside Knicks tickets for him and me tomorrow night.
Nooo!! She's really dull! And she gets this gross mascara goop thing in the corner of her eye!
Yeah, jus' second. Good-bye Mr. Heckles. We'll try to keep it down.
Who was it?
It could've been worse, he could've shot her.
Yeah, I know, I-I wish I had too, but y'know I-I think this is a good thing. Y'know? 'Cause we've had our first fight, and now we can move on. Y'know, I know for me- Nick's pants?
See ya!
I'm telling you, he's great! I mean, even if my sperm worked fine, I'd think he'd be the way to go!
Two hours, that lasted!
See uh, that's-that's actually what I wanted to talk to you about. I-I think I know who the other guy is.
Look at this!
Now wait a minute, I claimed you in the name of France four years ago.
It's Paris, who knows we're here!
Yep!
Somebody is gonna pick us.
Well maybe he was nervous.
Well, I did and it hurt. That's when I wrote the song: "Betrayal In The Common Room".
Althea?! What are you doing?!
Okay... You start on the image of a guy putting on the shoes. He's about my age.
Oh. Oh right! Right! Because you're still seeing him and uh, he's a good guy. I mean, I remember a time when...
I am so sorry. I really am. I was an idiot back then. I rushed the stage at a Wham concert for crying out loud!
Oh wait... What bed did you say she was on?
Well, I officially give you permission to break the pact.
Knit, good woman, knit, knit!
Why?! Why do I have to tell him?!
Ohh, yeah.
That's great. Can I see the book?
Worst porn ever! Worst porn ever!
Dude, you have got to turn on Behind the Music. The band Heart is having a really tough time, and I think they may break up.
Yeah! yeah... The hard part is over!
Well, I was kinda hoping we could do this without him. Oh no-no-no, leave the gloves on.
Why did you take the shower curtain down?
Yeah o-, OK, alright. Doesn't matter, time for Baywatch.
Hey Rach, now that you're working at Ralph Lauren, can you bring me back some of those polo shirts?
What... did you get me there?
Word!
Ha! I'm just messing with you.
That's me! Come on!
Help!
Oh.
Bye.
Oh yes! Monica, get in here! There's a high-speed car chase on!
I'll be a fool for you. I'm sure, you know I don't mind.
What is going on?
Oh all right.
Uhl..ell. By the way, in case you missed that, that sound was, "Uhl, ell."
Hey, look at this! They're lighting the big Christmas tree tonight.
Didn't you used to call it the Little Major?
All right, I'd say we make a pact. Neither of us will go out with Missy Goldberg.
"Jeremiah was a bullfrog. Was a good friend of mine, never understood a single word he said, but I helped himdrink his wine." So you just touch yourself for anything?
Oh, that's good. Maybe he'll hear you and pull the cord.
You didn't think I used to wear glasses, right?
Someone I don't know sent me an e-mail and I opened it.
Wow!! Can Joey and I put them on and fight?
Oh, God!
I'm not gonna watch it... I don't NEED to watch it... I mean, what good could possibly come from watching? Well, we know I'm gonna watch it.
Oh, we wanted to finish the crossword before we went to bed. Hey, do you know a six-letter word for red?
There's no back to this couch!
Trust me, you don't want him there either. Okay? Nobody is gonna be staring at the bride when the father of the groom is wearing a back-less dress.
Oh yeah! Yeah! Don't worry about me, I'll be fine!
We're growing up.
So what the hell happened to you in China? I mean, when last we left you, you were totally in love with, you know.
Y'know what I just realized? You just freaked out about our relationship.
Hey, kids.
Okay.
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What is all this pressure?! Is this some new kind of strategy? Why don't you put down your copy of 'The Rules' huh mantrap?!
Wow, this is weird.
Oh, you're definately not. I haven't cried like that in years.
All right.
Be-cause, we were talking about ways that he could beat Mike and I told him that Phoebe wanted to get married.
Oh, no no no, she took off with my clothes.
Yeah! I'm just pretending to watch the game so I don't have to help out with stuff.
Hey Jo. When'd you start usin' mousse in your hair?
Yeah, this more than anything else, is the staging area.
All right. Very good.
Okay. Okay. Yes honey, I made it myself. I can't do it. I can't do it. Oh! Oh! A mixed tape! A mixed tape!!
Janice I didn't even know you were pregnant! Who's the unwitting human who's essence you've stolen?
Hey, listen, I know I came in late last week, but I slept funny, and my hair was very very &ndash;
Erica wait!
Couldn't sleep last night you know, then I started worrying about this big divisional meeting that I have later today, the more I worried about it the more I couldn't sleep. Y'know? I was like, if I fall asleep now I'll get six hours sleep, but if I fall asleep now I'll get five hours sleep. Not matter what I did I couldn't fall asleep.
Okay, a quick one. Come on hug it out. Oh hey! There you go. Okay.
You're flingin'-flangin' right I am!
Hey!
Yeah.
Well maybe you're going about this the wrong way. You know I mean think about it. Single white male, divorced three times,two illegitimate children. The personal ad writes itself....
Yes, and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a child's pillow.
Well then maybe you shouldn't go.
Oh, thank you, sir... or man-who's-two-years-younger-than-me.
He's really picky about his patients.
Made a few calls, pulled some strings, and they agreed to seat us at 11:30 if we both had the chicken and didn't get desert.
Haha, no thanks!
Okay, did you see that?! With the inappropriate and the pinching!!
Not quite. Monica's still at the salon, and I'm just finishing packing.
What?
Nope! Every once and a while I just scream stuff at the TV.
She's smart and funny, y'know? We were up all last night talking, she said the funniest thing about--what?
Which I may say, right now, is out of control.
Hey!
What?
Ladies, ladies, let's just compromise okay? Phoebe, Rachel take off Monica's bra.
Yeah! When you were talking about Roger, that was killing me! Look, things like last night they don't just happen. Y'know? Or at least not to me. Or with the other two women, in the morning y'know I was just lying there and I couldn't wait to just go hang out with my friends, but with you I always y'know with a friend.
I was shrieking... like a Marine.
See, I told you they don't swim.
Why is that so funny?
Yeah, why not. So I told her.
It's wrong. They made a mistake. They think we're somebody else.
All right Joey, be nice. So does he have a hump? A hump and a hairpiece?
Oh! Thanks, I'm crazy about our place. Hey! speaking of crazy... do you have a history of mental illness in the family?
Oh, is it on the computer, cuz I'd love to give it a read...?
Thanks.
Oh yeah, I just showed this a picture of you and guys were throwing themselves at me! They're buying me drinks! They're giving me stuff! Knicks tonight?
Nice work my friend.
Ooh, she's asleep, that means we can...
No, no he went for a walk.
That's the stuff!
Well, either that or uh...
I wanna quit the gym.
Oh Joey's got a really bad hernia, but that's nothing a little laser eye surgery won't fix!
What do you mean?
BEND OVER?!!!
I'm sorry we, we don't have your sheep.
Well, let's just say the impressions you made in the butter left little to the imagination.
No, no, but they are going to lease us a Ford Focus. I'll get out of it.
Really? What?
I got nothing.
Thank you.
This is so sad. I mean, I only have like ten pins.
Might wanna try Joseph.
We don't, really.
Here we go.
Oh, those places! There's always so many people, their being corralled like cattle, and... you know, there's always some idiot who goes "Mooooo"!
No they didn't!
Okay, well tonight's the big night.
Everything is so distorted! Looks like Joey has a giant hand! Which says "Rangers" on it. They went to the game!
Y'know, I saw a wine cellar downstairs...
Staying out of the way.
Oh, no, no. I just meant hypothetically.
Hi.
We just finished this magnificent Thanksgiving dinner. I have--and I remember this part vividly--a mouthful of pumpkin pie, and this is the moment my parents choose to tell me they're getting divorced.
What? Oh, yeah, I'm gonna be a junior copywriter.
Ok, think, what would Jack and Chrissy do?
Y'know, I sensed that I should stop. So we're okay?
Okay.
What is wrong with Emma?
I do NOT want this unit!!
Fear of Triscuts?
Oh yeah, and what would my opening line be? 'Excuse me. Blarrglarrghh.'
Oh, Come on!
I'm sorry, I guess I just like the pulp.
I'm not worried, I'm uh, I'm fascinated. Y'know it's like uh, Biology! Which is funny because in high school I uh, I-I failed Biology and tonight Biology failed me.
In my defense, it was dark and he was a very pretty guy.
Huh.
I didn't know Ross and you were so close.
So there is no good time to ask that question.
Okay, on three. One....Two....
I can't help it!
Well, I believe the piece of furniture was fine until your little breakfast adventure with Angela Delvecchio
...Poulet passes it up to Leetch!
I'm gonna miss being able to afford food.
I can't believe we're doing this.
Oh, no, no, no, don't go! I've scared ya'! I've said too much! I'm hopeless, and awkward, and desperate for love!! Hey, Janice! It's me. Um, yeah, I-I-I just wanna apologize in advance for having chased you down the street.
I know.
DO NOT DISTURB DO NOT DISTURB! Monica:
I know. You're right. What's it gonna take for you to forgive me?
Hello? Oh hi, Doctor Connelly. No, she's not here but, you know, I can tell her. Should I be sitting down for this? Oh. Well, so what does that mean? Ok. Ok, thank you. Thanks.
Oh, that's Ross's.
Uh, yeah, I just got my pick-up sticks back from the shop. Bring your nerves of steel.
You do realise that's your brother?
How little?!
Do you think he'll ever forgive me?
You totally screwed him over.
Oh yes, somebody just said, "Can you hear anything?"
So ah, Joey tells me you two met in acting class.
Okay, so, I'm in Las Vegas... I'm Liza Minelli-
Yes, yes it is, short story, that I was writing.
Of course the packaging does appeal to grown-ups and kids alike.
Look, I can't do this. I can't make luv to you while we're fighting this way.
We were wondering what was taking so long with the gift, but now we understand you were doing this.
... And where's this money coming from?
Wait, wait, wait.
It means we're holding hands.
I mean, what am I supposed to do with myself?
Hey, Mon.
Look all I know is when Monica and I went to see them, we had fun! And there's another reason too.
Okay.
Whoa!!!
Buy it for ya, or win it for ya?
The Hard Rock Caf?
That is so not... That is so not... That... Oh, shut up!
Really? Okay, so...
Yeah, you know, I really thought I deserved it. But... let's go win the lottery... I mean, we still have 130 chances to win, right?
OK, what is it about me? Do I not look fun enough? Is there something. . . repellant. . . about me?
And you left the toilet seat up, you bastard.
You mean the spitter?
Owen didn't know he was adopted, and Monica told him.
OK, Pheebs, your turn.
Are they end to end, or tall like pancakes?
I need to talk to you, it's urgent!
Welcome home man.
Could we be more white trash?
I'm not going to let you say anything.
Does South Oregon have a sports-team? There you go.
No. No!
Okay.
Yes, and this with the cigarette butt in it, is that decaf?
All right, so you're telling me that I have to tell racist jokes now?!
I'm telling ya, Joanna's got it all wrong. Okay? All I said was, 'This was fun. Let's do it again sometime. I'll give you a call.'
Wouldn't it be easier if we just moved?
Hey Pheebs!
That's a great idea! We can easily think of a way for us both to enjoy the room.
Why not?
Well, did-did you correct him?
Yeah, why don't we lose the gloves.
Hey.
Have I got the 50 guys for you!
Look, I thought about it too, and I'm sorry. I think we should spend all of the money on the wedding.
Yes! See you and I have always been like-
Well this is great. Y'know, those cameras were the only thing that was gonna cheer Monica up today, she's really depressed.
Oh yeah!
I know. He has your eyes.
She guessed 8, 9, based on his drawings.
Alrighty.
Oh, no, no, I'm an intern, just like you guys... except for the tie, the briefcase... and the fact that I can rent a car.
Jill says vestibule... I'm going with vestibule.
No, it's not! When I looked at the other ring I could see Monica's face when I gave it to her, y'know? And I could see her saying yes. When I look at this ring, all I see is a ring! Unless I look at it really closely and then I can see my own eye. Look, this is the most important thing I'm gonna do in my life. I wanna make sure it's perfect.
I can't believe Joey. I hate being called a liar!
No, she's still upset because I saw her boobies.
I wanna quit the bank!
Hey.
Yeah, yeah! Me too!
Oh good, 'cause I've already thought of 3... 4! I've just thought of a fourth.
Depends on what you mean by we.
Yeah let's head off to work.
See now it feels like Christmas!
So who's gonna tell them?
Fine, I'll give the suit back.
Were you're parents happy, or something?
Yeah? You don't think it's just pathetic?
Well you should be. You missed the most powerful three hours in the history of the theater.
And I'm blah? Listen, the only thing more boring than watching modern dance is having to listen to you talk about it, "Oh Chandler, I just lost myself in the moment."
Ooh! That's my girl!
Hey, listen, why don't we go change in my room?
Okay.
The reason he just said.
Alright, now try taking a puff.
Let them win one.
You said that to me last week.
Okay, but don't touch it, because you fingers have destructive oils.
Hmm.
Where?
No, no, no-no-no. I smoked for years, then I quit. Right now, I can't remember why. You're not allowed to smoke in this office. Not right?
No problem roomie.
Hey, all right!
Whoa-wh-wh-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa!
But I'll tell you something. One of these days we're get off of our buts and rent Die Hard again!
Is that Joey? Is that Joey? Let me talk to him! I wanna talk to him!
Okay.
I don't think so!
So how's it going there in Financial Services?
Buh-bye. I just got us reservations at Michelle's and tickets to the Musicman to celebrate our first holiday season as a betroughed couple.
Ah, y'see, perfect might be a problem. Had you said 'co-dependent', or 'self-destructive'...
There it is.
Do you know what I was thinkin'?
Did she call? You-you told her I was sick right? Always tell her I am sick!
Jeannie, the head of east coast operations Jeannie?
Oh hey listen, don't be mad at him, it's our fault. I'm sorry we've been hoggin so much of his time.
And that's... how... it's done!
What gave me away?
Okay. Wow.
Jeez, relax! It's not like we're mar-ah-ah!!
Horn-swoggle.
I just don't see why those two can't work things out!
Hey hey! Where's the birthday girl?
I'll take a card.
I know what she's talking about.
So um, how come you guys haven't talked about this before?
Yes, Joe?
Okay. All right.
That's right! I'm not!
And twenty-five it is.
Hey.
Okay, y'know, we-we're safe right? I mean nothing bad can go down!
So it's pretty much the same Pheebs.
Honey, I know you're in pain right now, but I'm a little turned on.
When did I try to give you money?
Well, why don't we move this into the bedroom?
Sounds great.
I think it's great. It's great. Y'know, they're thinking of changing the name of this place.
Does anybody know me?!
Hey!
Oh my God! Those are my bedroom eyes?! Why did you ever sleep with me?
Oh really, I didn't know they had foosball in the 1800's.
I wasn't sure which one Mary-Angela was. Look, I'm sorry okay, I was really drunk, and you all look really similar.
What in God's name is that?!
What's wrong?
Oh man!!
Let her know I like her? What are you, insane? It's the next day! How needy do I want to seem? I'm right, right?
Phoebe, we can hear the dog barking!
Yeah, and then I fell asleep on the subway and went all the way to Brooklyn. Brooklyn is f-far!!
You bitch.
Your boyfriend is so cool.
Oh yea yea, absolutely.
Man, I'm so lucky I have Monica.
No-no-no-no-no!
That's right. You're husband's home. So, now the sex can stop.
Whoho ho... Listen to the judgement from the porn star!
Monica, there are no words... There are no words! This should not be this hard!
Oh, she's got you running errands, y'know, picking up wedding dresses... Wah-pah!
Doug!!
David is going to propose to Phoebe.
Hey, Pheebs!
Hi!
Well it wouldn't kill you to say it once in a while.
We are going to have a legitimate member of the clergy! And when I say legitimate I mean, gay and in control of his saliva!
Batman has Robin! We get ESPN right?
Well, I, I should go in there.
Without my toe?! I need my toe!
What?!
Ok, you can have it.
Oh, you're-you're going?
Okay.
Look, I may have jumped the gun here. Um, I just got out of a relationship and I'm not really in a, in a commitment kind of place.
Where's Monica?! Where is she? I need to talk to her! It's urgent! Is she here?
I don't think so.
Alright, we're gettin' closer.
I am really sorry. That is so terrible. I am so, so sorry.
So, this isn't over?
Okay so you mean no as in, "Gee Chandler, what an interesting idea. Let's discuss it before we reject it completely."
Yeah, she seemed cool, attractive. I'll do it.
Can you believe it? I mean, don't I seem like somebody who should be doing something really cool? You know, I just always pictured myself doing something...something.
Why? What happened to him?
C'mon, Ross! You, me, Joey, ice, guys' night out, c'mon, whaddya say, big guy, Huh? Huh? Huh?
Hey!
Hey! Oh, good, Ross! You're parents like me, right?
Okay, okay, a little announcement, I just want everyone to know that the position of my best man is still open! And uh, so is the position of the bride.
Easy Lenny.
Funniest guy she's ever met! I'm funny, right...? What do you know, you're a door... You just like knock-knock jokes... Save it for inside!
Wow!
Oh! She's growing inside you.
We're moving to Tulsa!
I love the specifics, the specifics were the best part!
My friend's name is Joey.
It's huge.
I see.
No!! Okay!! What's with the third degree?! Why don't you just shine a light in my eyes?!
Oh that's all right sir, and that's just one girl.
There was no fish when she dropped it off.
Hi.
What's wrong with you?
Oh, okay. Send her in.
All right, I'm gonna do it! I'm gonna get shot down. Any advice?
Oh, Satan's minions at work again...
What did you guys just do?!
No, did he hug you?!
What Richard thing?
We still have porn.
I can't belive it.
Ah, well, maybe thats, ah, because youre getting a big raise.
Yes. She was smart, she was pretty, and she honestly cared about me. Janice is my last chance to have somebody.
Well, I guess that's something.
Oh, that would be Monica. Hey, listen, I wanna borrow a coupla things, Aurora spent the night, I really wanna make her breakfast.
Okay .
Yeah. Just weird, you know. It's like: "Hi, I'm Chandler. May I have the human growing inside you?"
I can't believe you came back.
Hey.
And the moment of joy is upon us.
Uh-huh.
It's a baby! A beautiful little baby! And some other stuff I'm gonna pretend I don't see.
Emma? Emma? Look at me! Well, I think I'll go downstairs for a while.
Great, because my shoes are giving me a little problem on the dance floor, can I borrow the boots from your costume?
All right.
Hi, I'm Chandler. Your live-in boy
See? They're Joey's! J-J-J-J-J-Joey's!
Those were like the best seats ever.
Yeah.
That's a mailman! That's our mailman! Hi. How are ya?
Oh no! No! No! No!
Okay, I'm not gonna have one.
What?
USA Today.
Maybe I could give thanks by taking my Playstation over to my new apartment.
It's not that hard to learn. And as for people realizing you have no idea what you're doing, hey, you're an actor. Act like a processor, people will think you're a processor.
Honestly? Our apartment is a hotbed for electromagnetic activity. Now Monica and I have been immunized, but sadly you have not.
You sure?
I'm begging you stop.
I'm in college and I'm in a band.
You serious?
Yeah. We're doing the right thing, right?
I can't believe her! Did she tell you we were having money problems?
That new mountain bike?
And look how happy the mom is now!
What?
Yeah all right. Okay, good night guys.
I just wan't to...
Actually, I think this apartment sullies the good name of crap
Wow, it sounds even cooler when somebody else says it. I was awesome, ok? She was biting her lip to stop from screaming.
I know, I know, but you're gonna have plenty of chances. There are literally thousands of women out there just waiting to screw me over.
Okay, good luck with that.
Because then we would be the guys who turned off free porn.
What are you doing?
Excuse me. How ya doin'?
Oh, y'know what, I'm gonna be okay, you don't have to throw a party for me.
You okay there man?
Okay! So, what do you girls have planned for tonight?
All right, look, look, what am I gonna do?
Yes!
No ah, hold on a second Joe, where do Dutch people come from?
Ready!
Yeah, I ended up in the storage room, and not alone.
Hello! One marriage please!
Because it's too delicious.
Hello.
How do you not fall down more?
It is to me. You wanted to sleep with Batman, and instead you had to settle for Robin.
Janice is gonna go away now.
Oh no-no-no I was just squinting. That doesn't mean anything.
Well, bye Mon, bye Ross, Rachel, bye Emma!
Bad news. I watched the tape and passed it along to my bosses and they weren't interested.
Yes! It's flown into your blouse and you'd better undo your buttons lest it sting you!
Rhythm?
Ohhh Oh no, wait a minute, I have no one.
Why?
Are you judging them by their covers? Because you're really not supposed to do that.
Oh! Some guy. Some guy. 'Hey Jill, I saw you with some guy last night. Yes, he was some guy.
Hey!
I don't know! You were a delight to talk to. You asked all those insightful, great questions.
No not okay, you can't look for Monica's presents!
Look, I'm not saying that you should magically forgive me! But you're not perfect! You've made some errors in judgment too!
Yeah. Well, I think our second fight is going to be a big one!
Yeah I know, we're losing Ross, Joey said hence...
Does that room have a closet I can lock him in? We'll take it.
Really?!
What?!
What are you still doing here? She just broke up with the guy, it's time for you to swoop in!
Well that would be nice. I'll go get the lotion.
Oh, DAMN IT!
It happened in London.
Wow, it's, it's like porno for clowns.
Eh...
Oh, I'll go out and get you some.
His legs flail about as if independent of his body!
Hey! Hold on a minute, hold on a second. Do you think these pearls are nice?
Well, it's like that old saying, have some sex, eat some cake.
I Think last night was great. You know, the Karaoke thing. Tracy and I doing Ebony and Ivory.
Oh, will you give me the thing.
Maybe. Unless they're like two people who have lived in apartments next to each other for years, and then one day they're pushed through a vagina and they meet.
Why?
Y'know what this is like? This is like when my parents got divorced. Man, I hope Ross doesn't try to kidnap me after Cub Scouts.
Those are book ends! That's a great gift!
Does that mean I get the good loving tonight?
I-I can't believe Jill's gone. I can't help it, I opened a gate.
No reason.
You're right, this is more fun.
Here's another plan...No!
Oh that's great! Right there! Can we get some of that over here please? There we go.
Don't touch the computer. Don't ever touch the computer.
Rach, Rach, knock knock.
Look Joe, I know you wanted to do the wedding...
Okay, wait. All right, that's it, okay, I'm out of here. I am not going to be embarrassed anymore!
How about the closet by the bathroom?
Math!! You're giving me math! All right, look y'know what, forget about it, you go for the girl, we'll see who gets her.
Hey!
Your sister Ursula.
Well he's probably mad after you called him this morning to borrow his goggles.
All right, then massage me up right nice!
No. No, see when I first meet somebody it's uh it's mostly panic, anxiety, and a great deal of sweating.
Well no, Charlie's gonna get that.
Atlantic City!
You look beautiful mom. You look beautiful too dad. I love you both. I'm so glad you here.
Okay.
Well, it sounds kinda stupid... Who's she?
Ross, just for my own piece of mind, you're not married to anymore of us are ya?
Hey!
Yeah I just... wanted to call and say hey.
Not as much fun as last time. Apparently you only get porn if you're giving a sperm sample.
Yeah.
Hey, sweetums.
Oh well, that's uh, a little later than I uh, generally care to stay, but sure!
No, you don't have to, and you can't because I, I live here too.
Yeeeeahhhh.
Huh.
So you don't get paid unless the movie makes money?
Okay!
Oh, yeah, well, poor Richard. Y'... I can grow a moustache!
They do me?
Alright, alright, but you better be wearing clothes when I open my eyes.
Uhh, uh...
And I will cook anything you want in here , and do anything in there!
Oh, I don't think it was desperate, I think it was amazing!
Doesn't know, "Hello." But she knows Capricorn One.
I am, I'm ignoring you.
Ok well, thanks, you won't regret it. I'll see you tomorrow .
You are not allowed to laugh at my joke.
And...?
The spoon. You licked and-and you put. You licked and you put.
Oh well, that, that makes it not terrible.
No-no-no-no, if we let her stay, she will stay forever!
We don't need to remedy that.
Some of these look a little frayed.
Uh-uh, yes. I would like to see that ring please.
Okay.
Yes... thank you. That was... that was....
So is your apron. You're wearing it like a cape.
I know!!
Hey, why don't you wear those earrings I gave you?
That's one?
Okay-dokay, you've each won a game and I've lost what's felt like a year of my life. So everybody goes home a winner.
Wait! You're going out with Kathy!
And last but not least.
Is it loaded? Oh, little candy hearts. Chan and Jan Forever.
Something else I might have said?
What?
You know me sir. Oh ah, I do have a question for ya. Do you know how I get around the office computer network so I can access the really good Internet porn?
I thought you were showing me how much you mean to me.
Pete Becker. Pete... Is this him?
All right, look! Look. I think I can explain this.
Oh that's all right fellas, I saw a kitchen this morning - on TV. Stop talking. OK.
Okay. Here's a question you never have to ask. My dad just called and wanted to know if he could borrow one of your pearl necklaces.
Nothing, just a little extra air in my mouth. Pffft. Pffffffft.
I called you fat?! I don't even remember that!
Or a year?
Well, if he's gonna break up with you, maybe Joey and I should water his plants. If y'know what I mean.
Yep, we sure showed those Hassidic jewellers a thing or two about softball..
Are you looking at naked tribe's women?
25J and K, any chance those aren't together?
Well, remember the first time we saw Jaws?
Ok, they're coming, shhh.
What?!
Oh my God!
Yes you did! Admit it! You freaked out!
That's funny, this conversation's how I got the bullet hole in my head.
Yes that was a nice place!
Okay! This is it! We're gonna get married!
Why am I hearing cheering?
If you need money, will you please-please just let me loan you some money?
I think we may have really done it this time.
They don't really talk to us about that kind of stuff. I can get you some free white out though.
Okay.
How drunk are you?
Yeah, all right.
Honey, you remember my boss Doug right?
Tell me more.
Yeah, just leave me alone for a while.
Ok. So if we both had Emma and I die she'd have to give her up.
Why?
And then he did.
Yes it is! From now on, I have no first name.
Well, I suppose I'd have to say you!! But, what if we're watching a movie in here?
Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew!
I love you so much.
Hey!
Ha-ha-ha. A little to hard. What am I not ah, boyfriend material?
So- you can tell?
Joey, no means no!
Good luck.
I'm kidding. This is going to be fun.
Ross-Joey, Joey-Ross.
Well look, it's not easy to spend this much time apart, you know. She's entitled to be a little paranoid... or, in this case: right on money! ... You know, she's amazing, and beautiful, and smart, and if she were here right now, ...she'd kick your ass. Look, you're a really nice person... ham stealing and adultery aside. But, what I have with my wife is pretty great, so nothing is ever gonna happen between us.
H-He's in China!
Oh, come on. I can never get a girl like that with conventional methods.
Hi, how are ya?
Did that movie ever get made?
I think it just fell off.
I'll take it! All right look, I gotta know. Are you finished with me? Are you finished with him? Do you still love him? Do you still love me? All right look, I'm gonna need an actual answer here okay, so which is it, him or me?
Pheebs, we're not giving you a deposit for our wedding!
Had the money in the wrong hand.
She's right! If I were a guy and... Did I just say if I were a guy..?
You're in my seat.
Dude, you're shaking!
And to you too, Helen.
We share a wall! So either he's great in bed, or she just likes to agree with him a lot.
We heard you play all the way from your apartment!
Are you sure you weren't looking at your hands in a mirror?
What?
Dehydrated Japanese noodles under fluorescent lights... does it get better than this?
Yeah, I don't you should say that even when you're healthy.
Well, what's the deal with these? These-these look nice.
What are you talking about?
Hi.
Yeah.
Pheebs! We have to take you to the hospital now!
I am now!
Knock, knock.
I'm intrigued.
Oh my God!
I'm up! I'm up, I've gotten up now! Anybody ah, want anything?
We think he was trying to spell out 'MONKEY.'
Well, does that mean that you're not going to wearing yours?
Well uh, Archie needs money to fix his jalopy , uh but he doesn't want Reggie to just give him the money. So Reggie hires him as his assist-as his butler. And then makes him do all these crazy things like bring him milkshakes that can't have lumps in them.
Oh-oh, yeah, and did he also say that ah, some of the dialogue was corny and that he actually found it was funny and not sexy?
Your computer, I don't know wha... everything's gone!
Great! Now, the score is 7 to almost 7.
Okay.
Oh relax man, relax. You're looking a little flushed.
Look, we have no time okay? We must focus. We gotta get everything back into its original place.
Look at Officer Ross riding back here with the visitors.
Oh hey!
Monica's pregnant.
I'll tell you at the wedding.
They said it could be up to a year.
Stunning entertainment center. Fine, fine Italian craftsmanship.
Yes, I-I know that you do, but I think one of the reasons people were complaining though, was that they paid to hear the actor sing Old Man River.
Monica, I want a baby too, but this woman is giving away her child. She deserves to know who it's going to.
I did, but...
No, no, no!
Because you broke a chair and you broke a chair! The only one around here that hasn't broke a chair, is me!
Well, she's just so much fun with Joey, I just assumed, she'd still be living with him.
Could you get us a couple of beers?
Really?
Okay, we-we swallow our feelings. Even if it means we're unhappy forever. Sound good?
Kick save and... denied.
Kind of. She's coming by to interview us and see where we live.
What?
Will we love it so much with her next door? And she's gonna be louder out here too. Just the crickets and "Oh My God"!
Hey!
Peter Parker.
This is the worst bachelor party ever!
Well, I can't believe I've been here almost seven seconds and you haven't asked me how my date went.
Hey! Happy birthday ...
Yeah. Do we have any Fruit Roll-Ups?
Wait a minute, hold the phone! You're not Elizabeth's dad?!
I don't get it, I mean, you just got him. How can he be an adult already?
Yeah.
Oh, y'know what? The last time Joey went to a meadow, his mother was shot by a hunter.
Hey.
Monica, I think you've gone over to the bad place.
What about the time difference?
Technically we could have sex again. What do you think, bossy and domineering?!
Bye, momi-moo.
You're okay there?
All right! Fine! I'm going. But when I get back it's chair sitting, and I'm the guy who's....sitting in a chair!
Oh good, because uh we got Rachel 800 gallons of water.
Did you like me when we first met?
It is?
Well yeah, but then...
So uh, what did this woman look like?
Okay.
Okay, that hurt us.
Ethan? There's, there's an Ethan?
Hey, Janice.
What?! Ow!
...Come on! Why are we here?!
Fine, but if we end up not doing this Maxim thing because of this party...
All right. "My husband is sleeping with his secretary." She's married!
There's nobody here Joe.
He thought you said gonad.
An invitation for the At First Sight premiere? Oh my God! Val Kilmer didn't wear this in Batman! He wore it to the premiere of some tooty-fruity love story where he played a blind guy!
Honey! That's crazy! I don't want you to get me a stripper...
Its Phoebe! Hi!
Alright. "It was summer, and it was hot. Rachel was there. A lonely gray couch. 'Oh, look,' cried Ned, and then the kingdom was his forever. The end."
I think somebody has a crush on somebody.
And what does she have to think about? I love her!
And a date with a man!
I majored in lightning rounds. All right, we're gonna destroy you.
Wherever! I've got like 20!
Mine is the red one! Oh God. Can open, worms everywhere.
Friends!
Yeah, well, I only have twenty minutes until Ethan, so, y'know..
You know what? You don't need a thesaurus, just write from here, your full sized aortic pump.
So, thanks for having me over! Rach. Pheebs.
What is it doing here?
No, I can't. No-no, listen, I, I know how much this means to you and I also know that this is about more than just jewelry, it's about you and me and the fact that we're best buds.
Well, you-you know what I meant.
What? Nothing.
Honey, it's 2:00 on a Wednesday and I'm watching Road Rules, how stressed do you think I am?
Oh yeah man. Joey.
Right. You know what? Actually I just get off the plane, so I'm feeling kinda gross. Maybe I should just take a shower.
This teramisu is, is excellent. Did you make it Mary-Angela?
Did I go to this school?
Hey, what you guys talking about?
Well, of course I do! My good friend Joey over here.
Okay, look, I'm gonna have to ask you all to leave.
Soo... you girls having fun?
Muskogee! That's like four hours from Tulsa. Woo hoo!
Oh, then no thanks. What the hell was that? Mental note: If Jill Goodacre offers you gum, you take it. If she offers you mangled animal carcass, you take it.
I can't believe she cracked your code!
Oh no-no-no-no!
Hey.
I broke up with her.
Yeah? I hope you're not thinking about cleaning the living room.
I haven't seen this dress.
Okay. Shhh...
Why?
What?
You know, I mean, you can't tell your parents you were fired because they'd be disappointed.
I am so, so, so, so sorry!
Wow!
I am not working. There's not much to do around here!
No. No I'm just tired. Y'know, from-from the walk.
Let me finish ... however, it doesn't look like I'm gonna get this job so I can't afford to have principles, so screw you, the tickets are ours!!
Because I went to an all boys high school and God is making up for it.
And people say you don't pay attention. No, this is a much better job. It's vice-president of a company that does data reconfiguration and statistical factoring for other companies.
Joey, I uh! I can't believe this is how I'm spending my anniversary.
Chandler Bing.
Bamboozled?
Well you did pull his hair.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah! Thanks for inventing the lottery!
Okay, so what name am I cool enough to pull off?
Excuse me, look, we've been here for over an hour, and a lot of people less sick than my friend have gone in. I mean, that guy with the toe thing? Who's he sleeping with? Oh, c'mon Dora, don't be mad... I know we both said some things we didn't mean, but that doesn't mean we still don't love each other. Y'know, I feel like I've lost her.. Ba-!
I can't take the big white dog! You love it!
Oh that's so sweet! I want to show you something too!
Uh, Yes. Yes. Ive just been going over your data here, and little thing, youve been post-dating your Friday numbers.
You mean this.
Why wouldn't they be happy?
Actually he's the smallest person in the world.
So, that's it?
No, I invited him to dinner so you could get a chance to get to know him! I mean, if we go through a sperm bank you never meet the guy, get to check him out.
Yeah, ah, ah . . . I'll think of something.
Okay.
Oh my God!
Don't worry, I'm brave! I am brave! I...I am brave! No-no-no-no!! Can you tell me who is there please?
Whoa! Don't know about that.
Oh, you do? Because she said you guys havent talked in like years.
Done.
Well, I think you need to come out of your shell just a little.
Okay, there's something different though--Oh my God! You smoked!
Yeah!
Okay. Okay. What are you gonna do to me if you get the part?
Relax! We just get her some antacids.
Yes! Ross, you have to stay!
Okay.
No, no I just ah, didn't do them. Instead, I ah, hung out with a couple of friends and had a couple of beers so I certainly don't deserve any praise, verbal or otherwise.
Y'know, I-I could see how this could happen, y'know you're up there every night, you're naked, touching, kissing.
What?
You don't know!
Well, now we have one of each! And that's enough!
Hey, you said that without gagging!
Sure I would!
Yeah!
Listen, this is totally getting out of hand! Okay? She wants me to put lotion on her!
Thank you! Thank you!
Yeah.
Kill me. Kill me now.
Joey ate my last stick of gum, so I killed him. Do you think that was wrong?
Noo.
And err, he informed me that uh, she took the news rather badly, in fact, he uh, mentioned the word frenzy.
You see what I mean.
oh yes, God yes!!
No, no the gravel capades. Yeah, the turns aren't as fast but when Snoopy falls. . . funny.
Hey!
So when you said, "Get up early," did you mean 1986?
That was pretty intense huh?
No!
I have the lung capacity of a two year old.
Hey Ross, look what I've got going here.
Tonight? You-you didn't say it was going to be at nighttime.
Oh, oh, a quality, good, because I was worried you guys were gonna be vague about this.
No, I just had to get a picture of this.
Yes, I realise that.
Come on guys, PUSH!
I say, Drew! Are you seeing anybody right now? Og-ee-op, I'm not asking for me, I'm... I mean... No, I'm-I'm not gay, I'm not asking you out. I'm not-I'm not-I'm not gay!
Oh since forever! I used to go all over town listening to bands!
That was you?! I thought it was Jack!
Oh, hey.
Well, I'm going to kill you.
