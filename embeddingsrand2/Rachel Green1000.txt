Okay, you'd tell me the truth. Right?
Okay.
Oh hi.
He-he said Rachel, right? Do you think I should go up there?
Oh my God Ross! What in heaven's name are you doing here?
Well, I'm sorry, I thought you needed them!
Oh my God!
Ross, see! I told you, those swings are evil! Alright, that is it. That is the last time Emma is getting on one of those things for her entire life.
Well, come on, Steve; let's not rule out nervous laughter. Hey, now wait a minute. Phoebe told me that - that you owned your own restaurant. That's impressive.
Oh. Oh, that's great!
Yeah, okay, at ease solider!
Yeah.
Hey... Hi you guys! Listen, you know what? I'm not feeling really well. I think I can't get out for the play.
Umm, well I would have to say that it's a, it's tragic love story.
Hey!
No! Downstairs! And we got to talking y'know, for like two hours, and I really liked him so I invited him up here for a cup of coffee.
What?
Oh my God Phoebe, this is impossible! We can't do this by Friday! We have to find a place. We have to invite people! We have to get food! There's just too much to do! It's impossible! We can't do it! We cannot do it! We cannot do it!
Can I?
Hi.
Yeah, but that just means that he was falling asleep on top of her instead of me.
Yeah.
What-wh-what so we'll just stay married forever?!
Well, um, first he told me he liked how I looked. And, ah, then we had a little . . . um . . . eye-contact.
I - I have to get on the plane.
Yeah, I said what was okay when I thought she was some weird bald chick. I mean, y'know, that girl has hair got all over head!
Oh great! Suddenly she sounds like a biblical whore.
Okay. Hey. Umm. Does everybody hate these shoes?
Oh, howd she take it?
Ok.
Ugh! So close!
Well, can I talk to you for a sec?
Well, I-I-I've been on Standby for a flight home for hours.
What?
Chandler, what are you doing?
Ohh, I would love too.
Well, it is, all right? When we were out there today, all I kept thinking was: I can't believe Chandler is screwing this woman, but MAN this would be a nice place to live!
Really?!
Uh, no she doesn't but I can, I can get a message to her.
Huh... wow, so he's gotta be...
Yah, I'll have the soup and the salmon.
Aww.
Well y'know, I don't want you to be cold.
When you were in China.
You. Like you haven't done enough.
Oh. Oh! I can do it!
Oh, please, miss, you don't understand!
Why, when did you get out of the game?
Okay! Check it out!
Well guys tend to get naked before they're gonna have sex.
Oh it's important!
Okay great, hold on a sec! Oh, here you go! You don't mind do ya? That would really help me out a lot! Thanks!
No, I know, they're from me. Look you guys this is not good. I mean we have enough trouble with guys stealing our wind without taking it from each other.
Yeah, maybe if you're in love. But Ross, we are not in love, are we?
Yeah.
Yes okay. Well now see this isn't telling us anything. Joe. Carlos. Peter. Ooh! Peter Luger! T hat's a steak house!
Well, I'm very impressed.
And remember how you always said you were afraid the landlord would find out and then tear it down?
Ooooh! Honey, well we'll find you something. Do you wanna wear my black jacket?
Oh, OH! Wow, I love those! Where did you get them?
Ross, you're like my best friend.
Monica! I couldn't find him for two hours! He was having sex with Amy Welch!
Oh-A.
Yeah, it's a real shame you can't make it to that one-woman show tonight.
I cannot believe her.
What?! Are you crazy?
What?! I didn't have a good time in Greece! Ross abandoned me! Okay, I couldn't get a plane out, so I had to stay in their honeymoon suite with people coming up to me all the time going, "Oh, Mrs. Geller, why are you crying?" I mean, it was sooo humiliating. I felt like such an idiot! I mean, it's all my fault! And you know why, because I make very bad decisions.
I know. I know. I panicked, I panicked. I didn't want him to start yelling at me like I was some '74 Latour.
Oh wow! What now Ross you're not gonna talk? How on earth will you ever annoy me? Oh wait a minute, I know. I mean you'd think the damn jalepeno would've cleared up your sinuses, but no!! That's not enough... What are you doing?!
Maybe that's all we do, what about Julie?
No! If there was I wouldn't tell you.
Never happened! Good night!
Yeah?
Okay, let's do it. I'll move in.
Okay, okay, could we change the subject, please?
Oh wow, uh okay, uh maybe. Umm, yes, I can do that!
And I hope Barry doesn't kill you and eat you in Aruba.
He is so cute!
Hey Ross! I brought reinforcements.
But honey, I think she's moving in with Chandler.
Yeah, and-and-and by someone, she means Joey.
I know, it's amazing. It's amazing. It's so much better than what I had at Ralph Lauren. The money is great...
Phoebe!
On someone's lips? Where'd you get the hickey?
Do I have my own castle?
Yeah! Okay, two larges coming right up!
Look at that!
Oh my God!
I know!
Joey! Sit down!
Come on, please?! I'm boredddd! You let me do it once before.
Yeah but Phoebe...
Well maybe I'll just stay here with Monica.
Thank you. Hello? I still don't get it.
Oh good.
Yeah honey, I'm standing right there! Why didn't you just tell him about the mole I haven't got checked yet.
Oh, well, you are so cute! I wish I could play with you more, but I've got to go to work! I hope I stop talking like this before my marketing meeting, yes I do. Yes I do. Bye-bye, Joey. Oh, I seriously can't stop it.
Well then he gets a divorce, it's Ross!
Well Monica seems to think it's because you have feelings for me.
No, I was waiting for you!
Uh, I don't have any brothers so I don't know, but uh, did you guys wrestle?
Well, I just lost a job, and I'd like to raise the bet five bucks. Does anybody have a problem with that?
I'm so glad, I'm so glad you shared. And I'm glad that you're done. What do you say we umm...
Oh my God! I was so afraid I wasn't gonna remember any of my high-school French, but I understood every word you just said!
Ooh, Phoebe's here! Okay, let's turn out all the lights and we'll just watch the movie!
Ross, you don't even have oven mitts on!
Puzzler. A bit of a puzzle. Why don't you um, check the copy room, maybe you left the contracts in there?
Oh... you're not gonna do a magic trick, are ya?
Joey, y'know that you could just not throw the sticks up in the air.
If anybody asks, I'm your sister, Joan. Listen. C'mon, you guys. Ross said my name up there that obviously means that he still loves me!
She's right. She's right. You are no different than the rest of them.
I'm having a baby.
Please! During that second time you couldn't have picked her out of a lineup!
Hey Joey, what 'cha doing?
Even when we were having sex in that chair?
Hi, I'm Rachel Green. What can I do for you Joshua?
Has anybody seen my engagement ring?
You know what, Ross? I think we're gonna take off too.
I don't know. What do you mean last night? Nothing, nothing uh, happened last night.
Guys! Guess what, guess what, guess what, guess what!
Okay, I'm totally cool!
I mean maybe you didn't hear about a serious relationship called me and Joshua?
Ohh, what is in that?
Im okay! Im okay! Mr. Heckles, Mr. Heckles could you help me please?
Well, someone was supposed to write "Rach, take down the lights" and put it on the re... frigerate... How long has that been there?
Oh my God! Look what... you made it into a bunny. How did you do that?
Oh, I am, my side still hurts from when you crashed into me yesterday.
And sorta just put the receipt back in your pocket?
Hi! You're back from your date!
I'm gonna do it.
Oh, well, you know, they're just separated so, you know, never know, we'll see.
Chandler!! Are you gonna call her!
I'll get her.
Hi!
Hello. But you know what, hey, new day, new leaf, I am just really really happy ... I'm sorry, obviously Heather's ass has something more important to say so I'll just wait 'till it's finished.
Goodnight.
Noooooooo!!
Oh there is no way.
Well I...
Emma! See? I don't want it.
No! Of course we can wait. Alright, so I guess that means good night then?
Hi Daddy.
Sssshhhh!
Hi! Excuse us.
God! And to have to hear about it from Gunther!!
Wait, what are you doing?
Pheebs, Monica tripped me, I don't think I can ever run again, ever!
What?!
Okay, I'll see you back at home, if I ever get a flight out of here.
Chandler honey, I'm sorry. Ok, can we watch Joey's show now please?
But he has to know how I feel!
So you know how to fix it?
Monica, what should I do?
Oh, I would love some. But y'know what? Y'know what? Let's not drink it here. I'm feeling kinda crazy. You wanna go to Newark?
Well, I mean, sure, of course. But... you already gave that to Monica, so...
Oh, oh, oh, I'll get 'Rainy Day Bear'!!
All right, I'll see you guys later.
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
That's it. Ow!!!
All right!
Good, good, good, good, good.
I think, if it was a little colder in here I could see your nipples through that sweater.
mh hmm..
Monica's gonna marry a millionaire!!!
Why? Honey, what is the big deal?
Yeah, okay.
Oh! Whoops! I'm sorry, you were talking about Emily!
I almost caught that one!
Well, isn't that a good thing? You said you were sick of this.
Oh my God.
Ugh.
Maybe Joey's right. Maybe all good deeds are selfish.
Yes! And please tell her to bring a cake!
Hi, and I am also Emma's mother.
Whoa! Wait! Hello! What about me?
What?
Thank you!
I'm-I'm-I had no idea. I'm sorry. I...
Ok. So now, I think Emma is probably down for the night, but if you need anything Ross . . .
What is this?
Okay, stop-stop! Phoebe?!
But I told you, I didn't have the time!
Homo.
Oh, do I?
Yes, you are.
Huh.
Ok, well Monica, suppose one of your "special" tickets win? How are you gonna feel when you win the lottery and you lose all your friends?
Yeah me too.
Who ? Joey: Me.
Oh God, Ross. Ross is going to pick up the phone. Oh, I have to get my number back. Oh my God. He's gone.
Joey? Could you get that? What are you doing here? I thought you were in your room?
Yeah.
It's All Relative!!
Oh no! No! No-no-no-no! No, I mean come on that's-that's crazy-I mean that's crazy. So what's-what's going on with you? What is going on with you?
Okay honey, now I'm gonna try to listen from right here!
Oh!
leave...
Right back at ya!
Hi. Well hey, you don't - you don't think they're kind of cool?
Look, you know what, I'm sorry, but did you really think that this was going well? What's up?
Right, you, you only had a year. We only hung out every night.
Ohh! Hi!
Great.
Hey, you know, before you said that nothing could happen between us? What changed?
Ohh! Oh my God!
Well, does a good student drink seven beers during his first lesson?
Aaah... Ross, actually there's something that I really need to talk to you about.
I said it's still nap time.
Well, then I lost it. You buy me one!
Okay, but if it only happened that one time, how come we found your underwear in our apartment the other day?
Oh God, neither!
Oh my God! I'm gonna have to find another minister.
Okay Joey, first of all Kash Ford is not people. Second of all, what did he say when you told him I was pregnant?
Uh! The police!
Hmmm... this is so nice.
Oh!!
Because!
Anymore!!
Well, hon-ey. I'm just trying to look nice for your big night.
Oh, I really could.
Ohhh! Well of course I will watch him! We have fun, don't we Ben?
No. I...
Ross, hi, it's Rachel. I'm just calling to say that um, everything's fine and I'm really happy for you and your cat who, by the way, I think you should name Michael. And, you know, ya see there I'm thinking of names so obviously, I am over you. I am over you and that, my friend, is what they call closure.
Because!
Oh, yeah, sure, it's umm...
Hi! Okay, don't be mad at me, but I couldn't resist.
I'll be out in a second.
You stole them from me!!
They're not!! Ross, they're just saving them for the important people!! Okay?! What-what if I was the president?!
Yeah baby, I'll show you how we do it!
Well, yeah! We're cool. Totally cool.
Oh!! I love this job! Wow! My first call.
Okay! All right, pick a half.
Joey, Emma's right here! You promised not to bring girls home in the middle of the day anymore.
Ohh! That's great!
I don't want to say.
Yeah.
Noo, I y'know I don't see why she has to play with you, that's all. I mean doesn't she have any y'know other stripper moms friends of her own?
Why?
Uh yes, heroin and crack.
Oh! Yay! Look! There's a piece that doesn't have floor on it!
Uh, I'm just, I'm just looking out your window. At-at the view. What are you guys doing?
Wow! I mean, I just-I can't, I can't believe this. Y'know, I mean you think you know someone even, even Phoebe who's always been somewhat of a question mark.
Ok, Well, what about these are white cotton panties. Would they go with whites or delicates?
Okay.
Okay, well you had asked me how long we had known each other, and I said, "Eight years." And the um, waiter came over and cut his tip in half, and umm...now here we are.
Chandler!!
Monica, is this true?
Monica's making jam.
Oh. Oh my God.
I know. Days of Our Lives, thank you very much.
Joey! Come here! Come here!
Oh no-no-no! No, I got this all under control.
One hour.
No! No! Seriously, what's wrong with the dog?! Wait a minute, what are you doing home so early? What happened to your date?
What's your problem?
Look Ross, if you're so freaked out, just get in the car!
Oh, I can't believe I ever let him touch me with those fingers.
But I couldn't even if I wanted to, because I don't know! I swear; I didn't see anything, and I don't want to know! It was just a momentary lapse.
Yeah but, maybe it's not what we think. Maybe it's tell Monica I'm sorry I...drank the last of the milk.
Oh! Weather bitch!
Okay, I'm not just waitressing. I'm.. I, um... I write the specials on the specials board, and, uh... and I, uh... I take the uh dead flowers out of the vase... Oh, and, um, sometimes Artelle lets me put the little chocolate blobbies on the cookies.
Hi Daddy!
Oh.
Okay!
A cyborg?! Isn't that like a robot?!
Come on, this isn't funny. She thinks it's my fault that you haven't called her. You have to call her!
Hey! You remembered to put clothes on this morning.
Yeah.
Yeah, and could you please chop some up and just put it right there in the sauce?
Monica!
Is Ross here?
Clearly you don't want people to see this tape. Now I don't want people to see this tape either, but you so badly don't people to see it makes me want to see it. You see?
Well, yeah, this is the deal.
I didn't... I never said that.
What?
No. No, because I know exactly how the conversation's gonna go. "Hey Ross, you know, I think we had a moment before."
Well yeah, but I mean, it was good scared though, you know? Like when I-moved-to-New-York scared. Or uhm, when I-found-out-I-was-gonna-have-Emma scared... But this is... fine. This is gonna be good.
Y'know I can't even worry about that right now, cause I got the cutie little baby, oh I can't believe how much I love her, I can't get enough of her, like right now I miss her. I actually miss her.
Okay. God y'know, if someone told me a week ago that I would be peeing in Joey Tribbiani's apartment...
Hi Danny! Wow! Thirsty huh?
Well would you like me to lie down on the table?
Alright thanks, oh Ross could you stop by the coffee house and get me a muffin?
Yeah, I do. I-I do, do that.
Ooh, do I sense a little bit of resentment?
Oh, I blew it. I wouldn't of even hired me.
You fell asleep?!
Yeah right.
Phoebe! You can't do th...
Hey, listen, Ronni, how long would you say Chandler's been in the shower?
Okay. Yeah, that would be nice actually, to have the apartment to myself for a night.
Hi guys! This is Josh. Josh, these are my friends, and that's Ross.
Well, we were walking down the street and we saw that van that you guys used for catering and we realised...
It's so not a big deal!
Oh, oh, that's what you're talking about. Hey.
Ugh!
Oh, thank God I can't hear a word that you're saying!
Ross, you don't seem okay.
Really!
Okay.
No well, no it's not that bad, y'know? I mean yeah, my tongue feels a little fuzzy and these fingers sort of smell, I actually feel like I can throw up.
Ok, we never shoulda talked about this.
...see I can't decide whether it would go better next to the new wicker dining chair, the Sahara desk, or the Parker console table.
But! Don't you have to give him his money back?
Smell familiar?
Grammy, Best New Artist.
Oh my God!! Ohh, that is it! I'm leaving! You are just a horrible person!
All right! Well, uh... we're gonna hit the beach?
I can not believe your trading me!!
Yeah, sure!
Yeah, he thought he broke your chair so he switched the chairs!
Oh, Phoebe, that really cute guy is here again.
Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight with you Ross! Look, urrgh, maybe we should take a break.
Yeah, what's it about?
Ross, we actually watched the documentary together.
And so I had a lot of work to do so Ross, nice guy that he is, offered to help me out. And then we had a little wine, we got to talking, and the next thing you know out of nowhere Ross comes on to me.
But ah, you're safe from it if it's in the freezer?
No, he said we were holding up the people behind us.
I'm not! We're having a girl! Sometimes I can't believe it's with you-But still! We're having a girl!
Oh I don't-I don't know.
Give it here. Oh, God.
Really?
Oh. Yes! I would so move out!
No. No, I don't. Could you be a dear and go tell him?
It's a, it's a cat!
Yeah, we are definitely on Route 27.
Ooh, and it's so nice having this little sink here...
It's not a big deal!
Hey. I've got something that's gonna make you happy. Guess what Gunther found?
It's my father. He wants to give me a Mercedes convertible.
Oh my God, you guys, what am I doing? What am I doing? This is so un-me!
Yeah.
Hey.
Well, yeah... Okay, look it's about me and...
What's the matter?
Oo! When's her birthday?!
Oh my gosh. Wow, so beautiful.
Really?
Tequila!!
I love it at Joey's!
Oh no! Yes! Of course, I know that! I just-I meant y'know are you still a 'We' or are you just 'You?'
Mom that's okay that you didn't get you a gift!
Ohh!
He's not 11!
He just kept asking, and asking, and asking, and asking, and asking, and asking.
Oh my god, I left the water running.
Ok, uh-uh... Let's-Let's shop!!
Well, well um, you know, these movies are offensive and uh, degrading to women and females. And uh, and the lighting's always unflattering. And, Monica help me out here.
Yeah, she's gay.
They're in Vermont!! How could this happen?!
Oh. I'm sorry. I'm very sorry. Sorry. It's just, I'm ahh, I'm kinda excited. I'm, ahh, going to London to ahh, tell this guy that I love him and...
Oh you're not. You're not gonna get in the middle of anything, don't worry about Ross really, really. Oh! Hide! That's Ross! Hide! Hide!
Honey, it's not just a matter of where you put it. I mean a baby changes everything. They cry all the time. I mean imagine bringing home some girl and trying to score when there's a screaming baby around.
Sure.
Alright, fine, you go ahead and you do that, alright Ross.
Okay, first of all, if you keep calling it that, no one's gonna ever take it. Then, second of all you're not actually gonna have sex with him! You're just gonna make him think that you are.
Dear losers, do you really think I'd hide presents under the couch? P.S. Chandler, I knew they'd break you.
Well, y'know this whole marriage thing, kinda my idea.
Good bye!
Really Joey?
You're right! I mean you're right! It wasn't just the Weebles, but it was the Weeble Play Palace, and and the Weebles' Cruise Ship. Oh, which had this little lifeboat for the Weebles to wobble in.
And ya know what, now I've got closure.
No no no no no. You wanted me to take them down, so... ..Im takin em down. Okay? Whoa!
Phoebe you can't have both of them! You have to pick one!
Well, yeah, right, y'know what? Yeah, you're right, I mean, we no, we have our fun. Yeah! But if ......I mean, I mean like craaaazy! Y'know? Okay, all right. This is gonna, this is gonna sound y'know, a little umm, hasty, but uh, just go with it. Umm. Ugh. What if we got married?
Ohhhhhhhh God.
Aw. Hey, Pheebs, want this?
Ohh, well I'm not totally back yet, but thank you.
Whatever! Okay, I'm not your mother.
We should defiantly play football more often. Maybe there's a like league we could join or something.
Huh. Except, Phoebe's not gonna be the one that gets to dress them.
Okay.
How much longer?
Joey, I really don't...
Oh oh no just stopped to throw up a little bit. Oh come on, what am I gonna do, its been hours and it won't stop crying.
whoo... ok... wow... ok... OH!
Really?
Okay, that we may be able to do.
I cannot believe you guys! He was really nice and he left because of you!
Thank you. I...yeah.
Okay.
I ah, will buy and wrap all of your Christmas gifts.
Ross, my father doesn't hate you.
I don't know.
I forgot... I am supposed to pick up a friend at the airport. I am so sorry! I'm so... if you want to stay, and finish your drinks, please do.... I meanI'm sorry. I-I-I gotta go. I'm sorry.
I didn't uh, really have time to read this part of the books, but do you think we have time to...
Oh, she's so tiny. Where'd she go?
Not working with me, Joe! Here's the thing: lately I have been having thoughts musings, if you will!
Phoebe, you're on.
I do. I really do. I don't know anything.
All right, you know what, that's fine. If you guys want to be children about this, that's fine. I do not need to see it.
You?
You're going to have a baby, and you need to be prepared. Now, you're going to make yourself watch the whole thing. Just do it!
All right that's it! I am maid of honor!
Well, I... you know, I-I-I don't know what to say... I mean, I never thought of you as a guy who needed his men to be men. You know, 'cause I gotta tell you Ross, it not like you just came in from branding cattle.
The most unbelievable thing happened to me today.
Good luck, honey!
No way. No way did you do this.
Joey, where did you learn that word?
No! Wait! Come on!
Oh, making it worse!
Did you just break the radiator?
Oh, really, really? Well, it wasn't very good for me either.
Oh does it matter?! All that matters is that you look so handsome.
Oh! I have your key. Here you go.
Oh, Ross...
Oh my God, look there's Roy Gublik.
Go!!
Okay. Okay. Okay. Umm, maybe you can start with, "Chandler, even though we were friends; there was a part of me that always knew I wanted more."
Oh, thanks.
No! Shoot, Dr. Schiff what kind of question is that?!
Joey! Why did we have to rush out of there so fast?!
Phoebe!! Phoebe!! It's okay!! It's okay!!
It kinda worked. I mean y'know, I don't know about you buy I haven't thought about our thing since all this.
Excuse me?!
Yeah! You can hook it up to your TV and you get radio!
I know I told you, it's a really big problem.
That refrigerators don't live as long as people.
Oh, yeah go ahead.
Here comes another contraction.
Mon. Hi!
Oh that's right. You're the talker. Anyway uh, great idea! Umm, I gotta go to the store; I told him that I would buy him some more tissues.
Ohh, okay. Wh-Ah-ha! Wait a minute. Uh Ben, I can't do it.
Nothing...
Hello?
How?! How do you know?
Monica, what should I do?
Well...
You don't understand! You didn't see how brazen she was.
Yeah, right.
Yeah, sure?
Yes.
Well, I-I don't like it.
I say 'cheesy line', but ok.
I know, I know. And oh, and this time Chip promised that-that this time it will last at least for an entire song!
Hi Tag! What are you doing here?
What-what-what are you gonna do?
OH MY GOD!!!
Take the top down did ya?
See look Amy, we're a lot closer to Monica and Chandler. We see them every day. And truthfully honey, you don't seem very connected to the baby.
Hey Mon, let's give Pete a chance Come on, he was funny, he seems really nice, and that check thing was adorable.
What?
Yeah. And y'know who should've shut their drapes? Is that perverted old couple two doors over.
Thank you.
Oh, yeah, check it. Definitely, I want some of that.
Well this is romantic!
Take it like a man, Ross!
Hey!
Hey!
How'd it go with Pete?!
OK.
Uh, Paul's Caf. They got great food and it's really romantic.
So.
Hello?

Should I be concerned that a button fell off the old Hugsy and I can't find it?
Oh-ho!
Yeah but-but-but you liked me! Oh my God, I can't believe this, all this time, I liked you and you liked me!
Oh!!

Well, we were going to do that after-I mean umm, next.
Well it's only different if he wants it to be. I mean, I'm not gonna ask him for anything.

Thank you. Now are you sure? Because once I make a copy, there's no turning back.
Honey, y'know I just gotta tell you, I think this is such a terrific thing you're having these babies for Frank and Alice.
Do you want my pickle?
14?
Okay!
Alright, c'mon! Let's play Twister!
Hey, Mon, you want some help?
Ohh, I'm gonna have to get over it. God, see I didn't know that's I had to do, I just have to get over it.
Forgot my purse! Oh, you guys made up. He's a good kisser isn't he? I'm going!
Hmmmm....
Oh, why do you even bother? I already ruined her first birthday... And do you know how important these early experiences are Ross? Very! According to the back cover of that book that you gave me.
It was like this crazy-eyed, hairy beast man! He was like a, like a bigfoot or a yeti or something!
Ross, you got that for free from the museum gift shop.
Oh well actually gonna use a nanny and uh, I don't even have a housekeeper.
Well... he happens to be a very nice... guy....
So bad.
What?
Good! I'm glad it's not a problem.
Oh, yeah sure, Ok.
Honey, it's so sweet that you want me to stay, but I-I can't do that to you. I mean it would disrupt your entire life.
I think he's across the hall.
I couldn't be inner. Monica?
Okay, well, we brought you some wine.
Okay, I'm done. Do mine.
Yeah-eah-ha!
Yeah, four times.
She's totally right! When we were together, you got all freaked out about Mark and there was nothing going on.
Oh no, I can't. I got a date.
What?
Hi!
Merrill Lynch?
Yes, I realize that...
Oh, I wish he was a doll, then I could get a Rachel doll and bump them together and make kissy noises. Oh! And he has the most beautiful name, I never realised it, Joshua! Josh-u-a! Joshua! Josh.
No so we're protecting her.
Was she good?
Oh, I'm sorry, I guess I just bring it out in him.
Yeah-but come on-Listen, I'm sorry I don't want to make you uncomfortable, but I told Phoebe that it happened and she doesn't believe me.
No sorry hon, Monica's orders.
I don't know. We were watching TV, and then he pooped in Monica's shoe-
Excuse me! But this is a purebred, show-quality Sphinx cat!
Ok, maybe you're right.
No-no, it's really not huge.
What party?
Hey!
Nooo!
We're not actors.
What's the matter?
I know. And Mom, I realize you and Daddy were upset when I didn't marry Barry and get the big house in the suburbs with all the security and everything, but this is just so much better for me, you know?
Ah!
Impressive.
No!
Well you uh, you were always really good at the uh, at the uh the stuff.
Okay. Umm, well, first I would like to start by apologizing for kissing you and uh, for yelling at you.
So my mother is not coming to my baby shower?!
Yes! Y-E-S. Yes!
No, God! Please, let me!
So now, what are you doing here?
This is the worst date ever. How could you set me up with this creep?
Because it is too damn hard Ross. I can't even begin to explain to you how much I'm gonna miss you. When I think about not seeing you every day, it makes me not want to go... Okay, so if you think that I didn't say goodbye to you because you don't mean as much to me as everybody else, you're wrong. It's because you mean more to me. So there, all right, there's your goodbye... Oh!
Oh yeah surfer?
Ok-dokey, Joey, listen. This is gonna be bridesmaid central, all right? We're gonna have hair and make-up going on in the bathroom and oh, I had to move a couple of things in the fridge to make room for the corsages.
I... It just-it took me so long to get that desk organized.
What's going on?
Yes.
Oh okay, I see what you're doing there.
I'd love to!
Ugh! I cannot believe Chip dumped me for that slut Nancy Branson. I am never going out with him again. I don't care how much he begs!
I did!
Hey, listen umm, what-what are you doing tonight?
I got to figure out what I'm going to wear.
Joey relax! My mother picked her up two hours ago. You were there!
Insane!
Yeah, uh you-you probably need that for stamps, right?
Well, we have gotta find out if he's alive.
Over here!
What?
Then, no.
Stop it! Marcel! Bad monkey!
Oh that's all right! Y'know, I ended up having a really good time. Y'know, the charity was a big success and they raised a lot of money and awareness.
Agghhh.
Hello.
Okay, um, I... All right Phoebe look, I just wanted to say that I'm sorry. OK? I handled the situation horribly and I should not have lied to you.
Well since I'm movin' out and-and you're so beautiful...
Is Joey here?
Who?
Of course, of course.
Oh! Oh, no!
Aah! Why? What are these for?
Oh, thanks.
Ok, ok, so you're not a fan, but I mean, come on, you cannot do this to her.
You were with Julie?
Whoa! What?! Why?!
Guys, you're not gonna believe this! I was just saying goodnight to Emma and she said her first words!!
Noo.
Yes, my sister's giving us her place for the weekend.
What?
Well, you're the one who wants to fire him, so you're gonna have to do it.
Yeah.
Because , because, I just heard it. I heard it, and it's ridiculous! I mean, you're married. You're-you're married and it's just ridiculous, and it's like, it's like when said it, I sort of like, I floated up out of my body, y'know? And, and-and then I heard myself say it and then the floating Rachel was like, "You are such an idiot!"
We are so gonna find them this year.
Yeah, you bet.
What? What, do you mean you're not feeling well? What do you have? Is it Rubella? Because don't go near Emma, she has not had that shot.
Ohh! That's so great!
What?! What? What happened?!
Well, he's coming from Jersey, he said he would get here as fast as he could!
Well, umm, I guess I read Little Women more than once. But I mean that's a classic, what's so great about The Shining?
Thank you!
You're right, I'm sorry. Thank you. Okay, that's what I'm gonna do.
Oh Phoebe, I'm so happy for you honey.
Y'know, I'm still 29 in Guam.
Oh, please, you wanted to get caught.
Come on! I am here to take care of you! What do you need? Anything.
Yeah.
Music. Very nice.
Thank you.
Oooooh. : Oh! I got an interview! I got an interview!
I know, I just didn't want to wear my glasses on my first date.
Yeah, I didn't want you to get hit by the boom!
You stole the phone!
What?
Better than Chandler.
Oh, give me!
Ross, Joey is not here.
Yeah, oh wait!
It's still--It's got a tail! Get it out of here! Get it out of here!!
And now you're watching me walk away.
Okay.
No. I just need to be by myself for a while, you know? I just got to figure out what I want
Oh, honey! Don't get up! What do you need?
Time is money my friend?
Uh, OK, I mean uh, what, how are you gonna handle it. I mean, are, are ya gonna, are ya gonna talk about it before hand, are you just gonna pounce?
All right, all right. Let's go!
Oh, did you beat him at a board game? He turns into such a baby when he starts to lose.
Yeah.
Yeah?
Okay, Phoebe, honey, you gotta be kidding. I mean, you know you cannot keep one of these babies!
Op.
Excuse me? Oh yeah? Well, up yours too!
You need to learn some new slang.
I have to go to the bathroom.
Hi!
What?
Ohh! Ew!
Hi Pheebs.
I'm sorry. I'm done. I'm done.
Oh my God, Jill!
Well...
You can go.
Just a bug.
Ross, those things go like 40 miles an hour! Ok? When you're... and there is that moment when you are at the top, when you just don't know if you're gonna return back to earth!
Yes!!
Sagittarius?
Oh, come on, would you just grab my ass.
What bra?
Okay, so anyway I'm sittin' in my office and guess who walks in.
Yeah! No that's what I was thinking.
Well, she-she ob-obviously saw the tire tracks that were leading up to the closed garage.
What's up?!
Oh, so everything's okay?
She didn't hang up either!
Thank you.
Ew! No!
Well, I'd have to say gay.
Ross, it just wouldn't have been feasible.
How-how did end up in Vermont with that awful witch?!
Ah. Oh.
Oh, that is so sweet. I think I'm falling in love with you all over again.
AND YOU KNOW!!!
Ooh! My Chinese food! Let me get my cash!
True story.
You get away from me!! You sick, sick, sick, sick-o!!
C'mon, you guys, what're we gonna do, what're we gonna do?
Vogue! Hey, so tell me about this Jane Eyre woman.
Well, get back in there and talk!
No-no-no! No-no-no! Please Ross, I can't! I can't do it! It's just gonna freak me out!!!
Yeah...
Hi, guys!
'Cos I was gonna say there's no way you could've done the end the way you guys did it back then!
Barbara! Hi, how are you? Uh-huh. No, I understand. Yeah. Oh, oh, come on, no, I'm fine. Don't be silly. Yeah... oh, but you know, if-if anything else opens up, pleaHello? Hello?
How have you never been on Oprah?
I'm sorry. I didn't-I don't come in here a lot.
I'm gonna marry someone good y'know.
So forcing her to marry Bobby is gonna make that happen?
Your sunglasses?!
Well look who's here!
Right! Hi Dina!
Ohhhh, I cannot look at it!
Does it?
You pierced her ears!?
I could not have done this without you.
Ow! Ow!
What?
So, he's on the show, he knows what happens.
Okay. Okay.
Oh...see... but Joanne loved Chachi! That's the difference!
I mean, it-it was like, it was like he made us into a team.
I know. Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. All right, this is what we're gonna do, we are gonna go to the next highest bidder, and we are just gonna let them buy it, and then you're just gonna pay the difference.
Wow, that's great Ross, I'm sorry we weren't more supportive before.
Yeah, y'know I-I think I'm just gonna hang out in my room.
Ohh, here you are. I was looking for you before. Joshua's gone so you and Emily are free to go.
Ok.
No, you know what, I think you should go.
So I'm thinking about you. So what?
Bring it on!
Yeah that's great Paul, but y'know I wanna know what--Wow, those are really great! I just wanna know what, what is behind this-this strong, silent exterior. Y'know they say that still waters run deep and I wanna swim in yours.
No honey, it's okay! Listen, I'll got to Ross's and get the blender, you get all the margarita stuff ready.
Yeah Melissa, I don't want to be known as the uh, office bitch, but I will call your supervisor.
No Phoebe! I just need you there for support. I haven't told him I'm pregnant yet.
So did you break up with Joanna?
What, what, so that you can dance with the woman that stole your credit card?
Don't just say yes! This isn't a game, Joey you can really get hurt out here. Okay, so do you want to pay attention or do you want to die?!
Oh, I know, I know.
It's Joshua.
Ross, what's the big deal? So I kissed the guy!
Well, I'm sorry I went out with him when I knew you liked him.
Yes, but I, I think about who's apartment we're gonna sleep at tomorrow night and, and where we're gonna have dinner next Saturday night. I do not think about what our childrens' names are gonna be. You know what our childrens names are gonna be.
Bye!
Come on Ross! You said you wanted to talk about it, let's talk about it!! How was she?
Bye, Pheebs.
And the chicken pooped in her lap. Oh, I'm so sorry. I just gave away the ending, didn't I? Oh! It's just, I just heard this story in the cab, and it is all I can think about.
What is she doing here?
I know Mona, just hear me out. First of all, I'm so sorry about my father yelling at you, but I heard you totally held your own. You're gonna have to tell me how you did that.
That-that you came on to me?
You guys are really right...there aren't you?
Oh, no! No you guys! Come on, you don't have to do that! I'm happy for him! I am! I really-I'm-I'm happ-I'll work on it.
Hi! Thanks, hey so uh what'd you do last night?
How is it going with Charlie?
Wh-whoa! All right, okay-okay, I see, I see what's going on here! Now listen, look-look, I'm sorry if I gave you the wrong impression, but I am not some hussy who will just sleep around to get ahead! Now even though I , hey-hey-hey, even though I kissed you, that does not give you the right to demand sex from me. I do not want, this job that bad. Good day, sir.
You all know? Does Ross know?
Oh Ross, you're so great.
Uh-huh.
Allison's birthday party.
It's not? When was she born?
Oh, well, that shouldnt be so hard, now that youre dating. "Sweetheart, youre fired, but how bout a quickie before I go to work?"
I'm so dead serious. I'm totally serious.
No! No! No! I'm not yelling at you, I'm just yelling near you. Oh God Joey, ohh I'm my father. Oh my God, this is horrible! I've been trying so hard not to be my mother I did not see this comin'. Oh, Joey, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I just wanted you to learn.
And you were at this job for four years?
Rock-paper-scissors?
Sure...
Congratulations! Wow!!
Oh well, y'know, the gala had to end sometime.
Oh honey, I'm so proud of you, Min.
Oh my God! You really are freakishly strong!
Really?
Ok. Oh God. Get the camera, it's in the diaper bag.
Yes I do, it's just that Ross is. . .
I did!! I watched! I watched! I watched Monica bang his head against that thing!
I did.
Now the filet mignon, what comes with that?
Wow! What did he do?
Oh no. I mean it. After what just happened, I'm never leaving her again.
And-and what else?
But see, it was a plan. Y'know, it was clear. It was figured out, and now everything's just kinda like...
Where's Chip, why isn't he here yet?
That's right!
Or ya know, he's rubber and you're glue.
Uh-huh.
Yeah! Ohh, I've been waitin' so long to get on that body!
Hello? Oh, Pheebs! It's Phoebe!
OK, I'm guessing this is from...
Wow! Look at that, Chip Matthews called. I wonder what he wants?
Y'know, I-I gotta tell ya, those eye drops are a miracle. My eye is a 100% better.
Okay.
Well then honey, buy the lamp! Hey, we have that 60 bucks from Ross.
Honey, you got a little thing on your...
Okay, you are crazy! I'm sorry, but she sounded generally upset! I mean, listen!
Look, you guys... this is really, really important to me. And it means a lot if you could try to get on board.
I don't know. I know I don't work late tomorrow night.
I am not a baby! You know what? I swear to god, just because you get so uptight every time we...
Phoebe, it's me. I'm going to hunt you down and kill you!
Ohh, so no sign of Emily huh?
Well, what about my stuff?
All right, well, you're right, these are the best oatmeal cookies I've ever had.
Yeah!
It's over! You have to accept that.
No! No! No! No it's not! No it's not! Come on! Phoebe, ours is totally different! I mean we don't have the... We don't have the...that lamp! And-and that screen is y'know, on the other side.
Okay fine, I did. But I didn't see anything, I swear.
And your lap does not count! Okay? Come on help me move this.
Um, this is gonna sound kinda goofy but uhhm, my friend over there, who cooks by the way, um, she thinks you're cute.
Hello baby girl.
Oh, well, she's asleep now. Stop forcing that thing on her.
Really?! Even Ross?
Well tell us! What are they?
Just give us our apartment back!
Oh, wow! Congratulations, that's quite a waste of time.
I mean why, of all people would you want to go out with Chip?!
All right, I'm gonna make more margaritas!
Mom, would you relax. That was 10 blocks from here and, the, the woman was walking alone at night, I would never do that. Mom, c'mon, stop worrying. This is a safe street, this is a safe building, there's nothing OH MY GOOOD, oh my God, oh I gotta go, I gotta go, I gotta go. OK, that's fine, you just read the paper, I'm gonna get a pot, it's not for you. OK, that's fine, read the Family Circus, enjoy the gentle comedy. Aaahh, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, aaaaahh. It's open you guys.
Uh-huh.
No.
Well yeah...
Hi...
I know I had it this morning, and I know I had it when I was in the kitchen with...
I can't believe I ever even tried to help you. You are so beyond help.
Which one do you think she is?
Uh-huh.
Noo! Oh no! No! God no! He should not get back together with her. I know that! You know that! Even Ross knows that! But that still doesn't give us the right to erase his message!
No! They are mine!
Well, thank you, Melanie.
Oh, they're firemen guys.
Oh, I have to go pee. Apparently this baby thinks that my bladder is a squeeze toy.
No! Really, no, please, please, that's, that's okay.
Oh no, I'm good, I don't wanna get that turkey smell all over my hands.
'Kay. Congratulations on your new job.
Oh, that is so sweet!
Yes, and I know that you'd say no if he asked you, but I'm sorry; how great would you look walking down the aisle in this Donna Carin.
Ohh, so do you! Did you lose weight?
Oh come on Ross, we've done it before we'll do it again, it'll be a nice way to bookend the pregnancy.
What's up Joe?
I just never had a relationship with that kind of passion, you know, where you have to have somebody right there, in the middle of a theme park.
Oh that's right! I'm sorry! I-I am early! Finish! Please!!
Who are you talking too? Oh, you're kidding! Oh, it's a joke! It's funny. It's funny. I don't get it. Oh. Okay. Umm... I-I...uh, wow. Are you uh... How did umm... When?
Open it! Open it! Open it!
Thank you.
Hey...
You are the official baby crier stopper!
Okay.
30 seconds, okay.
Oh no! I took one of Ross' bags by mistake, and one of mine is missing.
Oh no. No Ross, don't do this.
Wow! I did not see that coming.
Well, I'm sorry I'm not going to an eye doctor!
I'm so sorry Pheebs.
What?! What?!
Of course I packed! Monica relax! I just wanted to ask Phoebe her opinion on what I should wear tonight.
I'm just going to grab the phone.
Well, it was, and you would have seen it if you didn't showed up at ... 9:30?? God! Oh, this party was lame ...
Man, don't be surprised if her hands and her feet get bigger too!
It's in Paris.
This is Chandler.
Yeah, I-I-I just pulled the tab and I just fogged his yeti ass!
Well, I assume I'll have to take showers with him, but y'know, that's true of any job.
Wow! That was amazing!
Y'know, I don't-I don't know. Let me, let me check.
Hey, this is hollow.
Oh, yeah, sure, sure, sure, sure. Listen, can we please have lunch the next time I'm in the city?
I still can't believe you invited Gavin. Allright, he is the last person I want to see.
No! Joey please! Please don't! Please don't leave like this! Now come on, you cannot do this to a pregnant woman!
Hey, I was doin' great before I found out about you. You think it's easy for me to see you with Julie?
Ok honey, you really need a job.
Well, sure...just a sec, though, 'cause Paolo's on his way over.
Yeah!!
I don't know, what were the names I just said?
I mean is that woman capable of talking about anything else but sex?
Come on, it's a hypnosis tape. This woman at work used it for two weeks straight and she hasn't smoked since.
Joey, why wouldn't you invite us to your parties?
You know it was you're uhm... birthday...
Monica, what did you mean before when you said you didn't want to talk to anyone, especially me?
Monica! Look! Hi! What do ya think?
Yeah.
Ross!
Yes! Did you see that?
Oh.. a little..
Well, you were pretty damn good.
Here. I thought you might be cold.
It's so secluded up here.
Yeah but, he's not your type.
Then how come it is?
Hi! So I just dropped Emma off at my mom's.
Hey!
Yay! Emily!
Huh, Bob Saget?
What?
Uh-huh.
Oh, hi.
Uhh, the mailman, the super.
Oh Phoebe, we forgot that party we have to go to.
And the video camera?
Um... Ross?
You know, actually it's more like, hi.
Care for a cherry?
Oh, Joey, it's so great to be back here. I gotta tell you, you're making it so easy on me and Emma.
"Dear losers, do you really think I'd hide presents under the couch? P.S.: Chandler, I knew they'd break you."
Ok, I will have the uh, side salad.
Ya, know what Barr, I'm not gonna leave. I probably should, but I'm not, see 'cause I promised myself that I would make it through at least *one* of your weddings . See now, tonight, all I really wanted was to make it though this evening with a little bit of grace and dignity. Well , I guess we can all agree that's not gonna happen. There's nothing really left to say except.... "Her name was Lola. She was a showgirl. With yellow feathers , feathers in her hair, and a dress cut down to there. She would..."
Yeah?
Oh really? So you're saying they just slid out of your bottom drawer, crawled across the floor, then jumped on to my desk?!
No! Come on! Don't make me go long. Use me. They never cover me.
Oh.
I think so.
What?
Because I promised Mindy I would.
From now?
What married?
Yeah that seems fair. We never use them.
Oh! I do not remember him! Wow! He's really got that sexy, smoldering thing going on. Oh my God, he's... Look at the way he's just staring at me. I think he's trying to mouth something to me, but I can't make it out.
Barry who I almost.
I bet 20.
Mrs., Mrs. Gobb?
What's up?!
Oh y'know what honey? Let's not talk about that right now?
What did, what did he say?
I don't know.
What?!
Would you let me talk.
Whoa-whoa-whoa, let's say more!
Ugh. Excuse me, could you give this to that guy over there? Go ahead. Thank you. Sorry. Okay, Las Vegas.
You would do that? I never get picked!
Oh come on Ross, why are we wasting our time with this other stuff?! We know what's gonna work! It's doctor recommended!
Well sure, if you say you're gonna take care of everything I have no reason to doubt you. Give me those forms! All right, now I'm gonna do this my way and I don't want to hear a peep out of you!
No, why do we always have to do everything according to your time table?
Oh they're pushing! They're pushing!!
Ooh, the gift shop!
Ugh, is she pregnant yet? She doesn't need to be; she'll still have the baby before I do. Oh Ross, another contraction!
Who's there?
You WHAT? You sang... to our baby daughter... a song about a guy who likes to have sex with women with giant asses?
Oh-oh, sorry, it's this way, it's this way.
What are you doing?
Oh what, you-you want both of them?
Well maybe it would make me feel better if I slept with Joey.
Yeah!
You're all gonna be aunts and uncles.
Why? Seriously I did not understand a word that you said.
What?!
No, I have two sisters. But one of them has a very masculine energy.
Hi.
Well, basically, lately, I've uh, I've uh, sort of had feelings for you.
Well-well, I don't know Ross-really?
Great, shoot, what are we gonna do?
No, I will. I'm just not up for it tonight.
Hey.
Come on you guys! What are doing?! I thought we were the patch sisters!
I can't! It's too late! Terry already hired that girl over there. Look at her, she's even got waitress experience. Last night she was teaching everybody how to make napkin.... swans.
Hey, listen, Joey, about Molly, I really prefer if you didn't go after her.
We were on a break!
Oh, I'm sorry, you're right.I'm sorry, good luck!
Thank God you're here! You have to help me! Were you just talking to yourself?
Shut up.
Okay.
Wait, we won't know that until we do it, will we?
Okay, well if I stop playing with Joey and Chandler, can I play with Mark?
You know what I really really want?
Space cowboy!
Oh, yeah, I'm sorry. They used to live here; sometimes they migrate back over.
Whoa!!
Everything you need to know is in that first kiss.
Hello.
Ok. If you really need to.
Cat! What'm I saying? Cat!
Ugh, I just gotta get the thing back!
Hmm, mild discomfort. So I take it you've had one of these Braxton thingies?
Oh.
Oh wow! Look at this place!
You what?
Yeah.
Oh my God.
Alright, that's it! Give it back! That's it!
Ah, this place is great!
What were you thinking?!
God, Ross, look, what you and I have is special, all Paolo and I ever had was...
OH, a soap opera roof party!! I'm going to a soap opera roof party!! Oh my God, oh my God!! And it's out of my system!
Who are these men?
That's because he's on your neck.
Yeah I know it's really boring, but it's like a big deal. Anyway, I was thinking about renting Cujo sometime.
Monica and Chandler are really moving in here and I have to move out and everything is changing.
I don't care how long ago it was! You told people that I was half and half! Y'know what? I just want to point out I never did anything to hurt you in high school.
All right. Woo! Hey, look at that, the airport's moving. Hey, are we moving?! Are we moving? Why are we moving? They said they were gonna wait! Miss? Yeah, does the captain know that we're moving? Oh my... Ross, you better be under the wheels of this thing!!
I thought it was Chandler!
Jill this is not about me being jealous of you! This is about you being a brat! Wanting what you can't have!
Nothing. I don't want to do anything.
Run Phoebe run.
Hi!
Don't worry, we're just gonna search here for an hour, and then we're gonna go over to Joey's and search, OK?
Hi!
Okay, he's a, he's a black capuchian monkey with a white face... ...with, with Russian dressing and, and pickles on the side. Okay. Thanks.
Gone! I mean its amazing Pheebs. I feel so free and so graceful. Hey! Look out for the horse! Sorry!
Sorry-
Don't say anything. I don't wanna speak, I don't wanna think. I just want you to take me and kiss me and make love to me right here, right now.
No, actually I took it off then I drew it back on.
Hey.
Uh-huh, doing it. Doing it. Phone doing it.
And Chandler, you're gonna have to watch those long showers you take in the morning because you know Raquel can't be late.
Wait a minute, you're only giving free stuff away to the pretty girls?
Well, y'know, sometimes that helps.
Ok!
Yeah!
I know, I know, I'm sorry-
Oh!
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh God.
I know Monica's worst Thanksgiving.
Joey asked me marry him.
We have to have a surprise Bon Voyage party for Emily. But it's actually for Joshua. Look, he said he's not ready to date, so I had to invite him to a party if I wanted to see him outside of work, and now I have the perfect opportunity to seduce him!
Oh!
What?
Okay, see now I'm scared because I don't actually think you're kidding.
Yeah.
Okay, I do.
"Pheebs, can't make it, got a date. Talk to you later. Big Daddy." Big Daddy?
Okay, well can't you just try it one more time Ross? For me? For me?
I can't let him go out that way, he's got a meeting. You've got something here on your back.
Yes! Hell yes!
I know.
Hey!
Ohh, well you got 'em.
Okay, no, that's not the right decision. That's not, that's not right, no Ross-Ross, come on! I mean, that woman made you miserable! Okay, Ross, do you really want to get back into that?
Yeah-No wait! Joey no wait it is. It's something. It's-it's umm...it's my boss.
Well what happened at dinner?
Ohh, he's married! Ross is married. I can't-I still can't believe it.
Emmm. Now, instead of the vegetables, is there anyway I can substitute the three-pound lobster?
Hey Pheebs, you're still alive! How are you doing?
Oh, I know, I know, it's-it's so, it's so totally like, "Whoa! Can we do this?" Y'know, I mean, but I mean it just feels right! Don't you think? It does! I mean, it just feels right, don't you think?
Why do you care about the guy who won the Paris trip?
Funny, because I was just gonna go across the hall and write that on Chandler.
No, everything's fine. I just gotta go back...
Yeah! Right! Okay, I'll see you guys later. Woo hoo!
Oh...
Ohh, gosh. You guys, come on, this is-I have to meet Joshua! This is my one chance for him to see the fun Rachel. Y'know the "Wouldn't it be great if she was my wife" Rachel. Ohh, all right! Are Joey and Chandler back?
Hi!
Oh dear God.
I didn't know you could get married here.
Oh!
Ross!
Ooh!
Ross said there's still no word from Chandler.
What college was that Dina?
