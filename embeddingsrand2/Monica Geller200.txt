Okay, fine. Let's talk about snow. -- Do you think it's snowing in Tulsa, where my husband is having sex on a copying machine?
You went to one where you were popular, and you got to ride off Chip's motorcycle, and wear his letterman jacket. I went to one where I wore a band uniform they had to have specially made.
I could do that.
That is sooo not true!
Y'know what really bothers me? Is-it's how-how different you act around them! I mean y'know the throwing the tennis games, the fake laugh, the "I'll see you around, Bing!" "Not if I see you first, Doug!" I gotta tell you, I don't like Work Chandler. Okay? The guy's a suck-up.
Why don't you just be straight with her? Tell her the truth.
The sun is out!
Wow! Play that message for Emily and this whole problem goes away!
We sure are.
Oh, dad, turn it off.
That's Phoebe! Where did you get that?
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I-I should probably leave you girls alone.
Oh, would you let it go already?! You're fine!
Hey, I know I what I want!
Please, just a little bit off the back.
That'll teach you to lick my muffin.
What are you talking about?
Oh, please.
Okay, now we just need something borrowed!
What musician?
Hi!
Well, go over to her! She's not with anyone.
What?!
So! So we've got to go upstairs and have a lot of sex to prove them wrong!
When I take a shower, she leaves me little notes on the mirror.
Absolutely!
It's supposed to be that small. It's a pre-appetizer. The French call it an amouz-bouche.
Oh! They're late and they're sloppy!
Old?
Yes! Exactly.
Hey Rach, the tampons here are only a penny. Let's stock up.
I guess. Why? Who's she with?
Thanks.
Ow!! Ow!!
I'm with you Chandler! I mean I can't have sex with a sick person either, that's disgusting! But I'm not sick! Let me prove it to you. We are two healthy people in the pribe of libe.
Because Armadillos also wandered in the desert?
Bouncy baby, Bouncy baby, Ooh baby baby, Ooh baby baby, Ooh baby baby.
I told you you were a bath person! Hey, when you get out, maybe I can give you a facial!
Keep going.
Hey. It's three in the morning. They don't know that I've come home yet. You notice how neither one of them are wondering where I am.
It's my TV.
I hope you're not full, 'cause dinner's almost ready.
Wait, was this a-a small mediterranean guy with curiously intelligent good looks?
Hi.
Umm, I-I really don't want to tell this story.
Ok, so there's not a magazine under the couch, or a pack of cigarettes taped to the back of the toilet tank, or a filthy video in the VCR?
Whatever.
Look!
Oh please! Did you hear that? Little drops of heaven.
Chandler, what are you doing? That thing can put someone's eye out!
It will be my pleasure. My guy has diplomatic coupons. Your guy can't even say coupons.
Are you really gonna do this?
No, it is me! Y'know, I'm not just the person who needs to fluff the pillows and pay the bills as soon as they come in! Y'know, when I'm with her, I am so much more than that. I'm- I'm Monana!
You didn't.
Hi.
I'm gonna miss you so much.
'Cause if you do that means you'd be cancelling it for me, and we're just friends.
Hi, Chandler.
I know! I know.
Is anyone thankful for anything else besides a thong?
So look umm, while we're st-still in London, I mean, we can keep doing it right?
You say 'Thank you very much,' and then you buy me something pretty. Come on, we're gonna put are hands in this bowl, and we're gonna start squishing the tomatoes.
Really.
I think, that if you really like this guy, you should just trust him.
Sweetie, I wanted you to have him too.
We should go.
For what?
Come on Chandler, come on! It'll give us great practice for when--people with babies come to visit.
Okay. Umm, Phoebe, you suck too.
Thank you.
Okay!
Ok, you got it!
Well, that's it You gonna crash on the couch?
Hey, what's this?
Carol moved her stuff out today.
I guess I wanted to keep it as a souvenir.
Oh, Larry.
Maybe, do you need a tissue?
You should feel great about yourself! You're doing this amazing independence thing!
Oh good.
Wait! Wait! This isn't take-out!
Come on. Hello? I'm sorry you have the wrong number. Okay, I'll call you later dad. I love you.
We'll call you!
We'll put buckles on it.
Really, you want to wait a year?
I know, I've been looking at those doors, they look pretty sound proof, don't you think?
All right everybody, this turkey is ready!
Hey Joey! Isn't that the girl that waved at you the other day?
Here's Frannie. Hmm, won't she be happy to see me?
Damnit Phoebe! How did you even call him?
Yes Rachel, why do you care so much?
Hey! What did you decide to do about the movie?
You said the baby.
All right, look, nobody's smoking pot around all this food.
I know, I just thought it would be fun.
Ohhh, ooohhh... you are on a roll, mister!
Really!
Do you still wanna call 'em? I wanna call 'em.
No that was Jarred! Wow! I haven't thought about him in a long time... Anyway, umm Will's, Will's here on business and he didn't have a place to go so I invited him here.
Hello.
Hmm, well you're around me all the time and you don't flirt.
I know honey, I'm sorry.
Daddy?!
Nooo! Okay. Whoa! Okay. See I was, I was a little nervous about turning thirty. So the bus boys took me out for some drinks. I wanna puke on you later!
Yeah.
Oh Ross, sometimes grown-ups have commitments they just can't get out of!
Hey, it's Phoebe and Rachel. Um, why don't you tell them what you were telling me earlier about me not being high maintenance?
Why don't you go see Dr. Gettleman?
'Cause I was going by it the other day and I saw that there was a stock with my initials, MEG, on it and, well, sometimes I have to watch for two or three hours before it comes up again but when it does, it's pretty exciting.
She said WHAT?
I'll try.
No Mom, I don't have a restaurant, I work in a restaurant.
Calling Dr. Big, Dr. Big to the bed.
Alright, well I'm tearing the lettuce.
What? Wait! Why? Chandler! Chandler! Wait! I'm sorry, I was just playing for one second! I was trying to find you to tell you that, look if you don't want me to see Richard again, I won't! He means nothing to me!
What?! Which one?!
Hey, guys.
Ross, I hated you when we were kids.
Oh, um, I don't know if that's a good idea.
Okay.
Kinda like your Barca lounger.
This is for the scratchy twins out there. I taped oven mits to their hands.
Well I'd probably be scared of a guy using a fake voice.
It's not mayonnaise!!
Hey.
Because they'll know we've been listening.
What are you talking about?! 007 has all those gadgets!
Kinda. Oh my God!
What?! Really?!
What?
He says he wants to leave the country. He thinks you hate him.
Hey, see that snippy guy over there? He's the one who decides who gets up on the platform. We should go dance by him.
Okay. Sorry.
Chandler? Can you give me a hand?
Well, I thought that I would cut up the tomatos.
Not any more!
What's this?
Ditch you? Phoebe, you were pregnant with the triplets!
Chinese menu guy. Forgot the menus.
Because! She's my cousin. I mean, we grew up together! We're family y'know? Well that's important to me.
Oh my God! Look at all the newspapers! It must be a good review! Is it great?!
Well, when you first met Barry, you flitted off to Vail.
Hello? No rejection? I got shot down at fat camp! Boy, kids are mean when they're hungry.
This was fun! But I've got an invasive vaginal exam to get to!
All right.
I said we are not going to do it, okay? Sometimes you can be such a, a big baby.
Same category?
Okay!!
Phoebe?
Hey.
Now, in some of these recipes, the quantities may seem just a little unusual, uh, like these coconut mockolate holiday nut bars. I've indicated four cups of coconut, and four cups of crushed nut, and only, uh, one tablespoon of mockolate.
Hi, that's what I'm doing for Phoebe!
No.
Wouldn't you love to do it just once?!
I'm not gonna go out with him.
Fifteen minutes.
I don't know.
So guys, listen, I go over there, and umm...
Hey, maybe I'll drive you up there! I'd like to buy some tickets myself!
Hey, don't blame me for wigging tonight!
I was frustrated.
I was always Joanne.
I'll help you fix your sweater.
: Is this not the good part? Do you want me to fast forward to something a little toothier.
Ok, hypothetically, why won't I be married when I'm 40?
Oh, Candy! She was so spunky!
Uh, Rach... how come you have dental floss in your hair?
Oh dad, really you don't need to...
Could you please tell me what this is in reference to? Yes, hold on. Um, they say there's been some unusual activity on your account.
So, where do you want to go?
No he went out to get pizza.
Thank you! 2nd Customer: It was. The duck in particular was superb.
Hey!
Congratulations, I think youve found the worlds thinnest argument.
Passport, check! Camera, check! Traveller's cheques, check!
Yeah you will! And, are you kiddin' me?!
Yeah and you better watch the flirting too, cause you know, in such close quarters, it could be trouble.
And you're cute too.
Bye.
Let's see. Congress is debating a new deficit reduction bill... the mayor wants to raise subway fares again... the high today was forty-five... and- oh, teams played sports.
All right... you're right. We're sorry. Now let's wake up Emma and get the fun time started!
Please... honey, leave the details to me. Now I wanna make this day as special for you as I can. Now, ok, I was thinking that the harpist should wear white.
Great!
Do you remember that jacket that you love so much, that you thought was too expensive?
I have nothing to say to you.
Okay, Phoebe you know what you're doing right?
That tape was never meant to be seen by... Joey I would feel more comfortable if I was having this conversation in private.
What are you talking about? If you get married in Vegas you're married everywhere.
Oh my God! Ross, you wouldn't believe the cute little noises the twins are making. Listen.
He's totally flirting with you too.
So, are you sorry that I told them?
Well, you're... you're different funny... I mean, you're... you're more sarcastic a-a-and... well, he does... bits... and impressions... and... and limericks...
Our kids are gonna call her Aunt Janice aren't they?
Ross!!
You know what? I-I think I'll wait out here.
No.
So what. So he drank a lot tonight.
Okay, ooh, alright. Name, address... Okay, in case of emergency, call?
Well, I want he baby to come out all cute and fat!
And I would have to say pah-huh.
