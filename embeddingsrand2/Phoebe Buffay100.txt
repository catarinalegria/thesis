So, here you are. It seems like yesterday I was talking to you in that little petri dish. Everyone said labor was the hardest thing I'd ever have to do, but they were wrong this is. Oh, I had the most fun with you guys! I wish I could take you home and see you everyday. Okay, I'll settle for being your favorite Aunt. I know Alice's sister has a pool, but you lived in me. Okay, so we're cool. Yeah, we're gonna be great. Little high fives! Ahh! Ahh! Ahh! Well, if you're gonna cry.
Oh my God! So was she! Oh, I've got-I've got goose bumps.
What are we gonna do? I'm starving.
Ohhh!
Great, I'm seeing water rings again.
Oh hey you guys!
Why not?! Maybe I can, you don't know!
Hey, y'know what might cheer you up?
Well, I can't give you a massage, because my licence has been revoked again!
Ohhh!!!
Hey! Oh!
That's a bird?
Although he does play with himself in his sleep.
Alright Monica, if there is something that you would like to share...
Oh my God! May I just say that you two gentlemen have the exact same hands! They're identical! Now, I've never seen anything like that in the business world.
Okay, well umm, I know that we haven't talked in a long time, but umm okay, our Mom is not our birth Mom. This-this other lady is our birth Mom.
Umm, it's negative.
Hi, guys.
Oh, have a great wedding!
Look out, incoming pumpkin pie!
Helloo! Oh!
Oh right, maybe I'll just go home.
I know it's le poo right now, but it'll get better.
Okay, but this can't be good for the baby.
No, I really wanna live with you! I wanna move in with you!
Well, freaked. 'Cause it turns out that the odds are really sucky. And! This is Frank and Alice's like only shot. Like, they are literally putting all of their eggs in my basket.
Hello? Hey Joey!
What is your job?
I'd call that excessive.
What are you saying I should do?
Oh yeah-No, she was really nice to me, but she's in hell for sure.
Oh no, one of those 'look for the hidden meaning' songs.
I am shocked! Shocked!!
Hi Joey.
I don't know what I'm gonna do about this coat.
That's right.
Yeah and yeah, and it would probably be better than the last telephone job I had. Y'know, I probably wouldn't have to say spank as much.
Oh my God, he's not even appreciated in his own time. I would give anything to not be appreciated in my own time!
Oh my god.
I know. It's just y'know usually when you're, when you're done with the pregnant thing, y'know, then you get to do the mom thing. I'm gonna be y'know, sitting around in my leather pants, drinking Tequila.
Yum-my!
Duly noted.
Come on more!
Nothing, I really wanna know.
Okay?
Uh oh, ooh, are we not getting along with the new boy?
Where? Ooh, come to Momma.
You are really good! I play a little guitar myself.
Why? Just 'cause you're too lazy to get up off your touchie?
Well, it's not so much that you know, like I don't believe in it, you know, it's just...I don't know, lately I get the feeling that I'm not so much being pulled down as I am being pushed.
Okay, I'll be out in a second.
Do you think they have yesterday's daily news?
All right. Did everyone get out okay?
God, I hope they kick his ass!
No! Barry and Mindy.
Oh God!
Oh, look look look. The last candle's about to burn out. 10, 9, 8, 7... ... negative 46, negative 47, negative 48....
OK. Ooh, OK, you gotta give me a second, I wanna get this just right. Dude, 11 o'clock, totally hot babe checkin' you out. That was really good, I think I'm ready for my penis now.
Sting's son, seven years old and there's a picture.
Oh yeah it is! I'm going to the movies and it starts in like five minutes.
Oh, alright, that's it, now I have to go see him.
That's so great! 'Cause you already know how to do that!
About twenty, a couple people from work who had something else to do.
Oh, because, you know... they don't like you.
Okay, fine! Fine! Mmm...hmmmmm....
Hello. Oh good. Ross could you put up some of these flyers for me? OH!! Demon!! Demon!!
Didn't you two already talk?
Oh, it's already closed, Chris gave me the keys to lock up-what is wrong?
Because, I'm just, I'm incredibly anal and an unbelievable control freak.
Joey, this is Mary Ellen Jenkins. So, Mike, how do you and Joey know each other anyway?
Oh, yeah, oh, I'm sure of it. You should just do it, just sweep and throw me.
Earl, you're not hearing me! All I'm saying is that you're not alone all right? Everybody hates the people they work with!
I got them!
Food here at 'Javu'..will kill you..the food here at 'Javu' ...will kill you.. Monica: Thank god, it's just you! I thought someone was swinging a bag of cats against the wall.
Oh, all right. What did I have?
Uh-huh, yeah!
Tomato tart and which of the pastas would you recommend?
It kicked! I think the baby kicked!
Wait! What?! No!! Elevator!! No!
It's a cotton swab with a bit of my saliva on it, so that if they perfect the cloning process while you are over there, you can use the DNA to create your own Pheebs!
You keep the old ones in the back, that is so ageist.
Oh, hi Max! Hey, do you know everybody?
Yeah. Candy's the mother, Cookie's the daughter. The father's also Cookie. Why am I friends with these people?
I don't know, I hardly ever say that about people.
Hey there, you handsome thing.
I really, really am sorry.
Um-hmm, that's good to know. But let's stop focusing on what you don't do, and start focusing on what you do do.
I think that uh, yours is a question with many answers.
Listen to this! My reading was wrong, I'm not going die!
You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it kinda looks like an old potato.
Bye!
But now she'll never know how he feels!
Sure, yeah, no I can do that, yeah, because umm, y'know, the muscles in the siadic area can get y'know, real nice and tight. So umm, tell me Rick, how umm, how did you injure the area.
Oh, do I have a middle name. All right Monica Velula Geller. It's that bedroom there.
Marcel?
Well, it's this guy I used to massage. And by massage, I mean hold down so he wouldn't turn over and flash me.
Oh that's my grandma. And thanks Joey she's having a really great time.
I had nothing to do with it. Okay, it was my idea, but I don't feel good about it.
Hey! Maybe you'll die!
Ohh, you are so lucky! Hey! So, where's Monica? Did you guys make up?
