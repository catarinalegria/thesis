What?!
I do the same thing.
Uh-huh, I get it, smoke, chimney, chimney sweep, very funny, ha-ha.
I thought it was Ross.
Ross is coming over. I think now would be a really good time to talk to him.
No, you're not! Last week you thought Ross was trying to kill you!
Noo!! No! You thought, you actually thought I wanted to have sex with you?!
Yes! And he said really mean things that were only partly true.
Oh!
Eight weeks. I mean I love my mother, but my God, a long lunch with her is taxing.
Hi you. I can't believe I'm waking up next to you.
Great.
Ya know, in crazy world, that means you're married.
Okay. Well that's pretty much all that we have-Oh! Oh! Have you ever had a virgin margarita?
Yes!! I mean sex does not have to be a big deal! There shouldn't be all this rules and restrictions! Y'know, people should be able to sleep with who ever they want, whenever...
Hey, guys, what's up.
Right.
I know. Yeah, see, there's so much to do and I have so little time to do it in.
Ya think?
