But I...
Phoebe, honey, wanna get some breakfast?
All right, look, here's the bottom line Ross, this is fixable, if we act fast, okay. So, I'll invite him to brunch tomorrow and you can make nice.
Ohh, I'm gonna have to get over it. God, see I didn't know that's I had to do, I just have to get over it.
What?!! Stop it! Stop it! Oh my God!
Yeah, you know, was I looking forward to going to Paris? Sure. You know, was I excited about working in the fashion capital of the world? Ooh, absolutely... Oh...! Yeah, but you know, this is... it's fine. I'm fine going back to a job where I've pretty much gotten everything out of that I possibly can...
Well, wait a minute, you're the boss! Why don't you just yell at them? Or, fire them?
You're so pretty.
Over here!
Here you go Pheebs. Who else wants one of my special homemade brownies?
Just get away from me!
That's right! 'Cause that would give him the control! So now he's all ooh, coming up with this whole I've got a party thing y'know, trying to get me to hint around for an invitation. Blew up in his face, didn't it?
Aahh, I'm a... chef at a restaurant uptown.
Well, Chandler said that it's really important to him too!
All right. What's your news, Amy?
That is not true. She did! She forced me!
Yeah, ohh! Why, damnit, why did I open my mouth? I have a crush on you; I am attracted to you. Gee, I-I know that I freaked him out
Well, then, you know, couldn't she have just copied my haircut?
Okay!
Yeah, maybe, but I don't think I even care. I don't think he's the one I'm sad about. Y'know, I know that I said that I am totally okay with Ross getting married, but as it turns out, I don't think I'm handling it all that well.
No! There's no orange juice in there! We win!!
Yeah, well, it's a Mercedes if I move back home. Oh, it was horrible. He called me young lady.
Wh-no, but y'know who did stop in here looking for ya, Tennille.
...I really don't...
Uhm... you haven't told these guys what they're doing in the wedding yet.
What are you shushing?
You and Ralph?
I'd do anything for you, you know that.
Ross, it's okay. You can come out.
Well, if anyone is keeping score, I no longer eat tuna.
Waitressing?
Oh good.
Well you uh, you were always really good at the uh, at the uh the stuff.
Which you're not, because you've totally hung up on him!
Please tell me you're not gonna dress up like a dinosaur.
Ohh! Yeah! Yeah that-that would've been a much simpler problem.
Well, what are you guys doing tomorrow night?
Oh, hi. I have a massage appointment under Rachel Green, and here is my gift certificate.
Relax! It's not like it's Citizen Kane!
OK, alright, OK, um... then could you please, uh... just give him a message for me? Please? This is very important.
So, what, you're just, you're just okay with being flaky?
All right, let's go!
Hey, you know, before you said that nothing could happen between us? What changed?
You really think it would be that different?
Come on, please?! I'm boredddd! You let me do it once before.
Ohh! Me too!
...Ross?
Yeah?
Oh please, what do you know! You married a lesbian!
DANGER!!!!!
Ohh, you've waited soo long.
I'm sorry, what did you just say? Did you just say hi? Oh my God, Ross, Ross, Ben just said 'Hi'.
Oh but you could. You can. Absolutely! We can help each other out! We can get--what are those--those patches! We could be like the Patch Sisters!
Okay.
Well okay, how about four hours in a freezing museum auditorium listening to Professor Pitstains and he's 'Hey everybody! Remember that thing that's been dead for a gazillion years. Well there's this little bone we didn't know it had!'
Hey! Hey! Hi! Hey-hey-hey, I'm Rachel! From upstairs? The ones with all the pizza?
Really?
Okay-okay-okay-okay-okay-okay-okay! I got it! I got it! I got it! I can't! I can't! I can't! I cannot go with you and my sister thing. Okay? I just can't. It's just too weird, all right? I imagine the two of you together and I freak out. It freaks me out. I can't do it! I can't do it.
Just tell Joey that you watched the tape and you liked it, but your bosses didn't. Then that way, you're the good guy and they're the bad guys.
Oh we did, but my mom got us the greatest gift of all.
What?!
Huh. A moo-point?
Shall we?
Chandler, what are you doing?
Hi.
So-Hey, Pheebs! So, how are the elves?
What do you mean, you fold? Hey, come on! What is this? I thought that 'once the cards were dealt, I'm not a nice guy.' I mean, what, were you just full of it?
Whoa!! Whoa, whoa, wait a minute. What time did your little friend leave? Oh my God. She was there? She was still there? She was in there, when I was in there?!
Awww...
If we broke up, and I lost you...
Oh, if she jumps, I get her tickets.
Thanks!
Thank you. Mon?
Okay, fine.
No, it's all right, you can just drop the act Tommy. I know what's going on here. Your Danny's wingman right? You guys are best buds. Frat bros!
Hey! You remembered to put clothes on this morning.
Alright, that's it! Give it back! That's it!
Oh, I really liked him. Yeah, it was really, really, really good.
Yeah-yeah, y'know if-if there was just like one little area where I-that I think we need-we would need to work on; I-I would think it was we're just not crazy enough!
Go-go-go-go, come on! So uh, what did you find out?
Aw, it's unbelievable! Wow! She is kicking so much! Oh, she's like umm...oh...who's that kind of annoying girl soccer player?
I still can't believe you invited Gavin. Allright, he is the last person I want to see.
Okay, James.
You're twins?
He left work in the middle of the day to do a personal errand and left you in charge when you've been working here two days? That's not, that's not right.
I would-Sequoia?
Yeah, I...
Joey...
Hey.
Really? Well, it seems to me if you'd done the right thing, I would not have woken up today feeling stupid and embarrassed, I would have woken up feeling comforted and satisfied!
Now! Give him the sandwich! Give him the sandwich!
And yet she was worth jeopardising our relationship!!
Well that works out good, because I'm not listening.
No, I can't, I have a baby.
So?
What are you doing?! Get in the front!
Wh, Ross what do you want from me? You want me, you want me to quit my job so you can feel like you have a girlfriend?
Hi!
What did you get her?
Not interested.
Yes I am!
Oh I don't-I don't know.
What?
Oh, of course!
Because, I feel like I wouldn't just be going out with him. I would be going out with all of you. Oh, and there would just be all this pressure, and I don't wanna...
Okay. So these signals Ross, explain this to me, 'cause maybe I need to be more careful. I mean, am I sending you these signals right now?
Oh God! This is silly, I'm gonna see you in a couple of hours!
Yeah.
Oh honey, but it is just about...
Well yeah, I wish that you would. Well, no it's not in there! How about that drawer?
OK, OK.
Or...I could call in sick and not deal with it at all...
That's right!
Why? Seriously I did not understand a word that you said.
Some uh, some visual aides.
What?!!
Hey, do you believe this? Do you believe they are actually getting married?
I know!
Come on you guys! Listen, if Emily knew I was here having dinner you with you she would flip out and you know it. It's okay, I really... I don't mind.
You just did a little dancy thing.
Whoa!!
Oh you know what? When I was a little girl I had a little pink pony named Cotton. Oh I loved her so much, I took her everywhere, I would braid her tail...
Yeah?
All right, will you, will you at least tell him how hollow and unsatisfying this, dating tons of women thing is!
Oh, that's crazy!
Yeah but, you don't, you don't, you don't want to try to much too fast. Y'know? I mean, you do remember what happened to the little girl that tried to much too fast don't you?
Ah! You know what honey guys are just different, they like things that we can't understand, you know I once dated this guy who wanted to pretend he was an archeologist and I was a naughty cave woman that he unfroze from a block of ice.
Ahh... Chandler's on the couch!!
Oh.
Well look, if you don't like this...
I wonder how Monica and Chandler could do it?
Op! Wait, you dropped a pea.
You know that depends on what it is! I've done a lot of stuff.
Oh, you know what - my first impression of you was absolutely right. You are arrogant, you are pompous ... Morgan! Morgan! Tag's last name was Morgan! Huh!
Ross, hi, it's Rachel. I'm just calling to say that um, everything's fine and I'm really happy for you and your cat who, by the way, I think you should name Michael. And, you know, ya see there I'm thinking of names so obviously, I am over you. I am over you and that, my friend, is what they call closure.
Um, this is gonna sound kinda goofy but uhhm, my friend over there, who cooks by the way, um, she thinks you're cute.
Ooh, ooh, ooh,ooh,ooh. Hi.
It is our first official date. Our first date.
Okay! Y'know what? I realized it was stupid to get upset about not having a husband and kids. All I really needed was a plan. See I wanna have three kids...
Thank you. What? You don't want to see this do you?
Yes!
Why?
You remember not having sex in high school, right?
We are looking for our Christmas presents from Monica.
Uh-huh.
IF you hold a spider.
Yeah, well, you uh, better make it for three.
Okay, all right, give me the mug! I'll keep the mug.
Wow! They really got you guys. Your T.V. The chairs.
Hi!
Oh my God, they told us that was for the mascot!
Pete the Weeper? Remember that guy who used to cry every time we had sex. "Was it good for you?"
How long?
Oh, hi.
Well, as long as we are clear about that.
Oh, please!Honey, just the fact that you want me here to support you, I'm...OH MY GOD!Is that Christian Sanders?He's so gorgeous!
So what are you gonna do?
Sure we should... So.
Ewwww!!
Hey.
Oh no, no, no. Oh God, you think I made out with him.
Oh, and somebody can get those leather pants she's always wanted!
Oh, I gotta get back to work.
Ross I'm so sorry. Okay. I-I will promise I will straighten this out with him tomorrow in person, or via e-mail.
There. Now there is.
No, no, no. It's ok. I'm gonna be fine.
Wow, Monica, you look just like your grandmother. How old was she there?
Yes, you did.
Ok. You decorate dad's office and so now you're a decorator. Okay! I went to the zoo yesterday and now I'm a koala bear.
Are you, are you, are you sure it's ah, a new bump? I mean, no offense, I've always thought of Ben as a fairly bumpy headed child.
I came with Paul!
It's Le Poo.
Wait, you can't go away this weekend! It's Emma's birthday!
Hi!
Now the filet mignon, what comes with that?
Oh Amy, don't cry Amy. Um.. Ross, could I talk to you in private?
Okay Ross that's fine, but can you please stand near my head?
Oh, it's a gift certificate to this new SPA in SOHO.
Oh yeah, I totally agree.
I think he's across the hall.
"Ooo," what?
Oh my God!
That proposal, at the planetarium...
Okay, I heard that.
No, I know, I know, and I'm sure your little boy is not going to grow up to be one.
God, oh God Monica, I forgot. This is our first date.
No.
When the Louis Vuitton people found out that Ralph Lauren wanted me back, the offered me more money! Isn't that great?
Oh-oh!! One hand on the sheet Joe!
Yeah, but you said, "Will you marry me?"
What about you honey, who would be on your list?
Wow! What did he say?
Well, yeah... Okay, look it's about me and...
Yeah. Oh! Was how you invented the cotton gin?!
Hello? Oh, Pheebs! It's Phoebe!
Terry is a jerk, ok? That's why we're always saying "Terry's a jerk!" That's where that came from.
Well, uhm... whatever, I have really appreciated it, 'cause I don't think I would be the person that I am today if it wasn't for you guys. See, I wanna help Amy the way you guys helped me. And I know it's gonna take patience, but that's ok.
Y'know what? I don't, I don't think Phoebe really wants to come.
They're having their baby! It's not fair Ross we got here first! Right after you left they wheeled her off into delivery. Oh but not before she gave me a juicy shot of little Jamie just crowning away.
Yeah.
You're welcome.
I don't have any issues with my Father.
Well, for starters I would've said the right name at my wedding!
Aw, honey, that's so sweet.
I know!
Joey, come on! It doesn't matter, you know, it's not like anything's gonna happen.
Little village people.
Really? You think that's all it is?
Joey!
Uh-huh.
No, no, not at the moment, no, I'm not. Are you?
Alright, somebody.
Oh-oh! Okay, she's kicking!
Ah, what is this? Well, lets see, we kissed for ten minutes and now we're talking to our friends about it, so I guess this is sixth grade!
I did!! I watched! I watched! I watched Monica bang his head against that thing!
No! No, I am not getting in a car with Ross, we will just have to live here!
OK, gook luck.
Well, they said would but they would only give me store credit. I mean, what am I going to do, get a thousand regular cats?
Oh, I'm fine.
Hey! Ross, listen can you come to a charity event tonight?
Well, however great she was I just can't afford that.
Okay, here we go.
I know... Honey, seriously, I did it all. The luggage that I'm taking is in the bedroom, this is Emma's Paris stuff, these are the boxes that I'm having shipped, and that's the sandwich that I made for the plane...
She's mine!
Well, I was kinda supposed to be headed for Aruba on my honeymoon, so nothing!
Hey, Mon, you want some help?
His new girlfriend!
Yeah.
How did we end up with these jerks? We're good people!
No, forget it! No way! I am not sending anymore Ralph Lauren clothes to prison. It is a waste.
Yeah but y'know what they say Mon, "There's no such thing as bad press."
So it would just be, me alone?
Alright, come on... Alright, you guys. We're so sorry we're late. Please let us in, so we can have dinner together.
Heyyyyy! Contraceptives are not always effective! Right?
I just never thought I would raise this baby all by myself. Pretty dumb huh?
Okay.
Yeah, we wanted to throw you a big surprise and a great shower, and now you don't have either.
No! No, of course not. No. That's why I brought it up. They didn't have any sodas?
What?
Hey, there was one Italian guy, OK, and do you even have a point?
Yeah but, my assistant Tag does sit-ups in the office during lunch. Ohh! I could just spread him on a cracker.
Right, you, you only had a year. We only hung out every night.
All right.
Hey!
Good, you guys are all here!
Ross, Joey is not here.
Oh yeah.
What?
Hey, y'know, at least you have somebody to miss that stuff with! I hate being alone this time of year! Next thing you know it'll be Valentine's Day, then my birthday, then bang!-before you know it, they're lighting that damn tree again. Ohh, I want somebody! Y'know, I want a man!! I mean, it doesn't even have to be a big relationship, y'know, just like a fling would be great.
Ahh.
Really?
Okay. Wait! Wait!
Oh my God! I can't believe you guys are actually think you're moving in here!
We love you, we're here for you.
Thank you Joey. You know what? I'm not even sure I can have caffeine.
And I'm in it? Then let me read it.
Really?
What?
Well, you more then me, but he can't stay to mad at me. I mean, I just had his baby.
Y'know who I always liked? Mork.
Joey!
Okay Phoebe, we can not tell anyone about this.
This is Chandler.
Really?!
Well Chandler, what is this very weird, metal A Z thing?
Oh, that must be it.
What's up?
No, come on, that is a lie. We also kissed in Barbados.
So from that you think you've got me all figured out? Well, you don't! Y'know I-I could have toys for underprivileged kids in here!
Oh yeah he's too cute to be straight.
Yeah. It was the weirdest thing. Zelner called me and he said we'll do everything we can to get you back. And that I should thank some Ron... I don't even know what department that guy's in.
What?
Not even with your best friend.
Ohh, I would love too.
Oh my God.
Ok, let me take these cakes back 'cause they're gonna take that out of my paycheck.
Excuse me, I wanted you to help, but you couldn't move your arms because you were wearing three life jackets.
What are you? Monica!! Stop it!! Oh my God! Stop it!
Joey, Joey I am so sorry.
Hi!
Wow that was a big one.
What?
Thank you.
OH! What's it the anniversary of? Your first date, your first kiss, first time you had sex...
Okay, okay, okay, I got one! Anyway- The valentine Tommy Rollerson left in your locker was really from me.
Okay, okay, I checked. We have: Earl Grey, English Breakfast, Cinnamon Stick, Camomile, Mint Medley, Blackberry, and.. oh, wait, there's one more, um.. Lemon Soother. You're not the guy that asked for the tea, are you? Okay.
All right.
Oh my God!! Do it!! Honey, you've waited long enough!!
I-I-I don't know.
Okay. Umm, what should we do for the theme?
..so, he said it was just a sprain, and that was it.
Oh my God! Really?! Can I see it?
Wow! This place is fabulous!
Well, so what're you gonna do?
Oh, I'm sorry. Ross Tillman.
Y'know I can't believe I even thought about getting back together again! We are so over!!
Oh, I read that in high school.
I did the first time! Oh. Oh.. And you know what. You want to know why I'm not giving Emily to you.
I know.
Pretty well, actually...
"Pheebs, can't make it, got a date. Talk to you later. Big Daddy." Big Daddy?
They're male nurses.
You are. Well, um... We, we, we were just... Wow!
Bye!
Oh my God! Oh my God! I can't go! I'm gonna be too nervous!
Yeah, looks that way. First ones here! Wooo!!
I got the job!
Honey, y'know I just gotta tell you, I think this is such a terrific thing you're having these babies for Frank and Alice.
Who?
Oh. Oh, that's great!
Okay.
There he is!
Chandler? It's Alan, he wants to speak to you.
Oh honey, I'll say good-bye to you at the car if you don't mind the puss.
Well then you just must have a natural talent for it.
Yeah.
No really, she didn't sleep well last night, so we can't wake her up.
Timmy was my boyfriend and you made out with him!
I know.
What?!
How are you holding up?
Really, really not.
Oh.
Why? Just because you're not mature enough to understand something like that?!
You what?
Hi, uh, nothing. That horrible woman just took my machine.
Thank you.
Hi! Sorry to bother you, but I don't think we can accept your acceptance of our apology, it just doesn't really seem like you mean it.
She asked-asked you out again?
... Ok, who is this?
Yeah.
I got it!
No please, show me how I begged you!
Umm... I'm never gonna getting married!
What?!
I could, I could but I don't want to! I want to kiss Joey!
No way, forget it.
If anybody asks, I'm your sister, Joan. Listen. C'mon, you guys. Ross said my name up there that obviously means that he still loves me!
But y'know, I never really had anything to worry about. Ross was never very good at the flirting thing.
Hey! Out of all of us, who do you think is gonna get married next?
Wh-You dated my sister!
Okay.
Well, Ross said my name.
This Alan again? How's it goin'?
Oh wait, don't you have to pay for your, Busty Ladies?
Oh Monica, we are so sorry.
Yes of course, absolutely! You're right. I'm sorry.
How-how did end up in Vermont with that awful witch?!
Country club newsletter. My mother sends me the engagement notices for 'inspiration.' Oh my God! Oh my God, it's Barry and Mindy!
Oh, come on!
All right, it won't come off!
Aaah... Ross, actually there's something that I really need to talk to you about.
Ok, ok, so you're not a fan, but I mean, come on, you cannot do this to her.
No! Shoot, Dr. Schiff what kind of question is that?!
You know we were all alone and he was being really nice to me and, oh and he gave me this scarf...
Ugh! No more crying! Please! I just dumped one cry baby, I'll dump you too!
Hi! I just wanna--Ahhh!!! Oh my God! Oh my God!
You know, when two people have a connection, you know, that's... just seems like such a... waste.
I lied! And I'm not sick! Just stay behind the curtain!
Wow! I can't, I can't feel my hands.
Well, just because it happened that way for them doesn't mean it has to happen that way for us.
Ugh.
Well, we were paying for our stuff and this saleswoman just started flirting with him.
Yes, I did. Thank you very much, it was excellent.
That's it. Ow!!!
Hmmm....
Okay, Pheebs, I was hoping for more of a change.
Bye hon.
Music. Very nice.
Oh that's so great, now Emma has two Hugsy's.
Oh no, I'm good, I don't wanna get that turkey smell all over my hands.
Yes! Did you see that?
I was just asking 'cause I need someone to watch Emma tonight.
It's not a purse! It's a shoulder bag.
Oh my God!
Ya think?
Hiccups.
Yes you are! Oh, I am so proud of you!
Goo--ood night!
Well, people missed you in there. And in fact, there was actually a request for "Smelly Cat".
You guys aren't doing anything tonight, are you?
Menstrual cramps.
Oh, nothing, he's just goofy like that, I actually, hardly notice it anymore.
Yeah, just so weird seeing him like that, you know? I mean he is a doctor, you don't expect doctors to get sick!
Ok. Oh God. Get the camera, it's in the diaper bag.
Oh, terrific! That'll be $2,000.
He was right there. He got down on one knee and proposed.
There were times when it wasn't even me.
I am not horsing around okay? I am Porsching around.
And remember how you always said you were afraid the landlord would find out and then tear it down?
Now, come on, come on, Steve. There must be something that you like about yourself.
What-what-what are you gonna do?
Yes.
Okay.
Really? How good?
Oh, get out of here!
Hi you guys.
Well, I mean, sure, of course. But... you already gave that to Monica, so...
They made you head of the department!
Wow, you guys, this is big.
Ross!
Monica, what should I do?
Just washing the windshield.
D'oh!! I've got it!
Oooooooooh. Oh, that's nice. Oh, oh. Huh, Ross!
Hi.
I dumped him.
Yeah, maybe if you're in love. But Ross, we are not in love, are we?
Oh, come on! This is crazy! Can't we just flip a coin?!
And that's Phoebe , and that's Joey.
You were with Julie?
And I'm Rachel, an admirer of the building.
Let me see that. Oh, yeah.
Huh-huh, no act--no, uhh, that, that is basil.
Oh, Mon, sure.
Oh! Well, um.. You've got plugs!
Central Perk is proud to present Miss Phoebe Buffay.
Well, I feel fine, but I think you're bumming out the rest of the kids.
I don't know. The left one.
That's not Monica!
Oh, and Monica gets to keep her? In her house? I am so jealous!
I am freaking out!
Well it's hard to tell... Oh God, if she would just stop moving.
Oh wow, eight hours? So you could probably really use one of those plug-in telephone headsets huh?
Who are you supposed to be?
What?
Oh Chandler, I know, I know... oh, hey! You can see your nipples through this shirt!
Really?!
Wrong! How do you get the mainsail up?
Well, y'know I-I don't know where he is.
That sounds like a plan. Umm, is there a place I can go freshen up?
3-2-1 oh!!
Oh my God, I can't believe this is a real $20,000 check, oh this is just so exciting.
Ok, we can do this now, can't we Ben? Yes we can, yes we can. There. I did it. I did it. Look at that, oh, stays on and everything. Hi.
What?
We did!
Oh, anything yet?
Oh I know. I know.
Well, y'know it's just been so long since I've been to Chuckie Cheese.
Phoebe and I saw Chandler with a blonde woman today outside on the street and then we followed them to a house in Westchester.
Hey.
Yeah, well just be glad he's not playing a smaller instrument.
What?! Are you crazy?
Yeah! That would be great!
Do you think it's possible for two friends to fool around and... and not have it be a big deal?
No, there isn't time to go to the bakery. We're just gonna come home... Everybody left? Alright, well just tell Emma we're gonna be there as soon as we can. Bye...
I know. It seems smaller somehow.
Hey! Joey, would you mind giving me and Ross a hand moving his couch?
Man, don't be surprised if her hands and her feet get bigger too!
He's got this thing. And I keep telling him to go to my chiropractor...
And your fly's still open...
Oh thank you! Thank you, thank you, thank you! Emily?
You pierced her ears!?
Wow! Look at that, Chip Matthews called. I wonder what he wants?
Well, I'll be waiting for you, just come up when you're done.
Oh, no no no no. I see what you're doing here, alright, listen, this is my job buddy. Okay, I've had it for five years, and I know how it works, so why don't you just catch me up!
Really? Me?
Why not?
God, you have to tell me what happens tomorrow!
Oh... Oh boy... Hi...
...if you tell me, I might do it.
What do you mean?
So umm, you're gonna stay with me as long as I need you?
Okay. Okay. All right, you take care of that. And meanwhile, the party is tomorrow and we still don't have a guest list.
Hi! I just want to apologize. I'm really sorry I was a baby.
so basically you've slept with all the woman in New York and now you're just going around again.
Ok, Well, what about these are white cotton panties. Would they go with whites or delicates?
Chandler M. Bing?
I say 'cheesy line', but ok.
Uh-hmm. I'm just thinking about Phoebe; poor knocked up Phoebe.
Hi!
Oh no!
Huh. All right.
Okay, I'm just gonna write this out to cash.
Oh great, the pacifiers?
Yeah, this is Tag. Tag, this is Phoebe. Phoebe, can I see you for a second?
Oh! There's nothing above your bed!!
Hey! Y'know what? Let's talk about relationships!
Why didn't I get that message?
No, it's just that uhm... it feels so good... Ikea... Yeah, say hey, you'll know this, what's the capital of Sweden?
Oh Daddy, no he didn't mean anything by that, he really didn't.
Last night! I just felt it and I went into Joey's room and he was sleeping...
Yeah.
Wow! It looks like the Easter Bunny's funeral in here.
Hi! I'm Rachel Green.
Hi!
Look, you know what, I'm sorry, but did you really think that this was going well? What's up?
What?! You got us evicted!!
I know, I'm her!
Yeah, come here!
We're not gonna do this, all right? She's just gonna think that we're doin' it.
