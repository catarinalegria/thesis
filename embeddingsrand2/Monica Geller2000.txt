No.
Deal!
All right.
Chandler, this actually bothers you?
Fine,
Two in a row! You've got to use your tongues now!
Hi.
I don't know, I've never had to use the other one. I'm just saying y'know, if we're having sex, he's not gonna be talking.
Well, I thought that I would cut up the tomatos.
Oh god, waddawe do, waddawe do, waddawe do?
Okay.
Rach, Phoebe hates Pottery Barn.
Whatever Ross! Just replace the bulbs in the brake lights after you're done.
It's hard for some people!
I knew it!! Y'know, you're not so quiet yourself, missy!
Oh, what a great gift! Is The Way You Look Tonight on it?!
Alright, well, this does not change anything. Okay, we need to get something to grease the sides of his face.
Oh, I'm- I'm so sorry!
We're really glad you decided to meet our guy.
No-no, I-I just, I liked them so much that I went out and bought some for myself.
Hey Rach, could you get me some cough drops?
I am not 'so'! OK, I was a teensy bit weird at first, but... I'll be good. I promise.
I can't be fair. You're my boyfriend.
Look!
Apparently you were umm, a little mean to him in high school.
Okay.
Ooh, and I can do this.
Yeah, well you call her and tell her that y'know when we were kids her precious little Frannie tried to undress me several times, okay? And if I hadn't have stopped her, there probably wouldn't even be a wedding to go too.
No! No! I shouldn't have even opened these! I mean I-Joey I am out of control!! Joey, you have to do me a favor. No matter what I say, no matter what I do, please do not let me open another present! Okay?
Really?!
Pretty much. So, what do you, what do you think of the floor?
Okay, here's your penis!
Wow! All right well, I mean, what can you do? If you lost it you lost it.
Will! From high school.
I think that's you.
Chandler, umm, I want you to take just a minute and I want you to think about how ridiculous this sounds.
So what. So he drank a lot tonight.
Grab my ass!
Ok, which one of us do you think is gonna be the first one to get married?
Rach, wait, I can cancel...
What?
Oh, you mean like that guy thing where you act mean and distant until you get us to break up with you.
Maybe I can try at intermission? Phoebe, come on... you know what? Let's just go!
Hey Ross. What's up bro?
That's insurance fraud.
A hat! Yes! We need a hat.
Huddle up.
Can you blame him?
Yeah! And the winner gets a hundred bucks.
Well, an-anyway, I just-that night meant a lot to me, I guess I'm just trying to say thanks.
They thought Joey was a child?
Rachel-Rachel-Rachel I-I cannot, I can't let-, actually I kinda want to see what happens.
Hey, it was very moving! You're just heartless!
Carol moved her stuff out today.
You'd better hope I don't see you in the hallway!!
Great. So the ball is in his court?
Ohh, you're about to get a little luckier.
Hey, did you guys know, that your oven doesn't work?
No-no. Nothing wrong about that.
You just wanna stay home so you can make a move on Joey!
Oh my God, my ass is sweating! Please! Please! Can you come? It's today at four.
Oh, right.
I know.
Leon, Leon. Shhh! Guys. Wait, I don't understand. Those steaks were just a gift from the meat vendor. That was not a kick back. I'll just replace them and we can forget the whole thing. What corporate policy? No. Yeah. All right. I just got fired.
I am good. I finished my book.
Oh... what does that mean?
I just can't believe you're in here. I mean, what am I gonna do without you? Who's gonna crash the embassy parties with me? Who's gonna take me to the Big Apple Circus?
I got one. "Socks. Because your family's feet deserve the best."
Rach? Can I talk to for just a minute? I-I dropped some socks.
Look, maybe this is none of my business, or maybe it is, I don't know... but, uh, I'm kind of worried about you.
Yeah, a-a-and clean. Not just health department clean... Monica clean.
Not that, this, US. Oh my God, Ross, you-re, you're, it's jus-, you-, ever sin- you been here.
Yeah. Run ten blocks, that'll help the smell.
Hey, did you stop by here?
Thanks, I'm set. Do you still live with your parents?
Right. Umm, listen since we're-we-re on that subject, umm, I just wanted to tell you that uh, well, I-I was going through a really hard time in London, what with my brother getting married and that guy thinking I was Ross's mother...
Hey.
David who?
That's it! Take it! Take it! Take it!
All right, we should call somebody.
I'm really getting tired of sneaking around.
Sorry we're late.
You know, it's a really funny story how this happened.
No.
It's Joey!
Hell no, we'll pay!
Woo-woo!
Yes smokie, that is what it was. I just can't get enough.
They won't be ready for weeks.
Yeah, sure.
Oh, and the newspaper delivery guy.
We weren't picking up, it's Amanda!
Okay everybody, let's go! Let's go!
How do I tell Chandler that it's too soon. It's gonna break his heart, he's not gonna think that I don't love him anymore.
Uh, no!!
Crematorium Chris? Sure!
We have a baby?
Just go up to her and ask her out. Oh, what's the worst thing that could happen?
Ohh, fun!
Seriously, what is this supposed to mean?
Yes it's true.
Oh, why? Why? What happened?
Okay, we're gonna need a distraction.
Okay.. Well, I'm going out with a guy my friends all really like.
How do you feel?
...Yeah. Yeah, I do.
Okay! There you go! It's two tickets to Vegas!
Hey Phoebe! Guess what?
Because I don't have the money or the equipment to handle something that big on such short notice. I mean there's no way.
I wish all guys could be like him.
Okay, come on, do it one more time!
I can't believe this is taking so long. How are you doing?
I'm sorry too.
No-no-no, that's a video-phone. But hey guys you're not supposed to be here, so please, do not touch anything.
You don't tell me what to do! I tell you what to do! Just call her. She's at the Paradise Hotel in Barbados. And while I've got you, you've got curly hair. What do you do in humidity? Damnit!
See, I've been waiting my whole life to be engaged, and unlike some people I'm only planning on doing this once. So, uh y'know, maybe this is selfish and I'm sorry about it, but I was kinda hoping tonight could just be about that.
I guess.
Rach, does this have nonfat milk?
Okay!
Hi Chandler. It's really nice to see you NOT.
I've not seen her since high school graduation. Oh my God, that night she got so dru. . . motional.
Hey! Continuing the countdown of your favorite meals. Tonight, No. 3, macaroni and cheese with cut up hot dogs.
Thanks.
Amen.
Fine!
You can't fire me. I make your decisions and I say, "I'm not fired!" Ha!
Make it fifty!
Oh, blablablabaybaybay.
Ok, my husband just gave your boyfriend some very bad advice. Look, David is going to propose to you tonight.
You're jealous of Princess Caroline?
Because I know that you think the lottery is "boohaki" but we're all here and gonna watch the numbers and have fun. And you're my brother, and I want you to be a part of this.
No, you were right. I don't have a plan.
Okay, let's talk about something else.
So, Chandler, who's on your list?
Oh really, so that hysterical phone call I got from a woman at sobbing 3:00 A.M., "I'll never have grandchildren, I'll never have grandchildren." was what? A wrong number?
Hi, come on in.
Chandler, please, come on. Look at him.
Okay.
: he has to work, there's some rush on the big ah damn it one of these days I'm really gonna have to start listening when he talks about his job.
You did not go!
No, you don't want this. I want to have your grandmother's cookie recipe.
Hello?
So, what are you saying now?
Oowww!!
Honey, that's a great idea nailing the boxes to the floor!
I'm gonna miss this hand! Okay I know it's a lot to ask, but oh my God Chandler, this is a once in a lifetime opportunity.
Dr. Greene. Oh my God it's Rachel's dad. What're you doing here?
Haha!
Oh, did you catch him?!
Fine. She's wearing my bra!
No, give me the...
Which we are, and-and we already paid for it. It's My Giant!
Mmm.
If-if-if we ever did what you did a man would never call.
Good? Didn't you hear them...I was great! Thank you so much for making me do this. That's is the best gift ever.
They baked it. I can't take this anymore. I'm gonna call a meeting tonight, I'm gonna fire you tonight.
Ok, here we go. We need to sort out the tickets as quickly as possible to see if we've won. So does anybody have any ideas how to organize this? Ok, how about this: we divide them into 6 groups of 40, and the remaining 10 can be read by whoever finishes their pile first.
This is different! Greg and Jenny are in a relationship.
That's the surprise!
I'm going to get bigger!
Whoa! Whoa!! Tackled by a girl! Bet ya don't see that everyday, do ya?
Ohh my God, I'm so sorry.
I'm gonna go put my make up on, we have to be at the hotel in an hour!
I... I'm sorry, did you say something? I can't hear through all this damned hair!
Some moms do that.
You do?!
Isn't he an architect now?
You know what I'd love to do? I would like to go to France and eat nothing but bread and cheese-Not even bread, just cheese. No, I want the bread. Yeah. Ah, and pastries... And pate. Oh, I'm really not high, it's just I used to be fat.
The guy who made these hates feet and wants to see them die!
Okay, you're fine.
Oh because it doesn't...really fit. Oh by the way, I-I booked the Swing Kings.
Here, let me make the milk, I'm up anyway.
Say you're sorry.
Hey.
Is it me? Is it like I have some sort of beacon that only dogs and men with severe emotional problems can hear?
Urghh!!
Happy birthday!
I mean I-I thought you were nuts at first, but you-you did it. And now you can just look back at this thing with no regrets.
One!
Hey!
Well for your information he happens to be one of the brightest, most sophisticated, sexiest men I've ever been with.
All right, he's keys are in the drawer. Y'know what? I also need some cash.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Hi.
Ross! That is so sweet of you to get Phoebe that bike! When I heard the story, I almost cried.
Hey Tim? I need a calamari and a Caesar salad. And umm, could you get me the pesto?
Oh, no thanks, we're just here to observe.
That's right, she came back all by herself.
Really?
What's so funny?
That's it big girl! Come on!
Wow, do you mean like kiss him-kiss him?
It bit. It was a 50's theme restraunt. I have to cook in a costume and dance on the counter. I mean I was a chef at Cafe des Artistes. I mean how could I take a job where I have to make something called Laverne and Curly Fries?
Well, we... "bore false witness"... See I could be a reverend.
Oh no! What's the matter?
Okay! There's only one left, three letter word, not dog but...
Ok, the first person's most embarassing memory is, 'Monica, your party sucks.' Very funny.
Chandler! Chandler! I just figured out who you are!
Do you really want to pull at that thread?
How? I don't have any money.
Did you just flick me?
I didn't change!
What do you have against the beautiful guest room?
I so wanna be attracted to you.
Chandler one time wore my underwear to work!
We're not really gonna buy these people steak dinners are we?
Phoebe, that stuff is...
Hey guys check it out! My mom sent me the paper!
Are you okay? You've been acting weird all afternoon.
Well you know it's just like living with a girl. Only they don't steal your makeup. Unless they're playing "This is what my sister would look like"
Really? Wow! It looks like I had some trouble staying inside the lines.
You did it! You got ordained?!
Then get over yourself! Grow up!
Well, you're not.
You painting his toenails?
Oh, why?
Joey, I think you should consider something a little less risky. I mean, I think in this market, real estate is your best investment.The Fed. just lowered the rates and the interest on your mortgage is totally deductible. That's right, I know some stuff!
Wait a minute, you stayed home all day and played Ms. Pac-Man while I went off to work like some kind of chump?!
It's gonna be a problem, isn't it?
You're fired.
So the going for help went well?
Just waiting for you sweetie.
Actually, I did!
Aww, man!
Yeah. I mean it was kinda fun for a while, but didn't you start feeling silly?
Ok, it's 2100 hours. Time for your toast.
Hi, Josh.
What was that?
Janice, what umm, what are you doing here?
Noooo!!!!
That's not totally true.
Y'know, I try to stay positive. . .
Mom, uh, Chandler was just saying how beautiful your sweater is.
You serious?!
What?!
Another good point.
You know, it still smells like monkey in there.
Pheebs, you remember how we talked about saying things quietly to yourself first?
It's nice.
Hi.
You're supposed to double the tax. Not double the tax of Romania. I mean, what's-what's the deal? Are you, are you trying to buy me? Is this the way you get girls to go out with you?
No! Are you doing it?! I don't hear anything! Come on!
Yeah, we really do!
Would you ever be a surrogate for anyone?
Oh my God.
Well, I mean what about friends of your grandmother's? Wouldn't they have the recipe?
Yes, it was!
No! To take more pictures of all of us together. I mean I really think it's the best resolution because everyone will enjoy the pictures.
What are you talking about? She obviously lives on the second floor, seventh apartment from the left!
Oh! Oh my God! That is the most beautiful top of a head I have ever seen! Chandler, you have to see this!
Oh God, I am so sorry honey...
You had sex in his chair?!... I said that a little too loudly, didn't I?
Shh!! Wait, what?
How, how did that happen?
Dad! There's Ross , why don't you go talk to him?
I can't wait to be with you! I'll just tell Rachel I'm gonna be doing laundry for a couple of hours.
Oh, but wait I do have a globe.
Oh my God!
131!
Yeah, we switched meat suppliers at work, and the new guys gave me the steaks as sort of a thank-you.
No you don't!
No, too late. You can't give it back!
Why don't you just have a seat here? OK... give me the Gummi-bears.
Nooo! Never! I mean, we're living in the moment. God, it is so nice for once to not have to get all hung up on 'Where is this going?'
It's almost our anniversary!
Y'know, I love doing crossword puzzles with you honey!
No, only because that's the graduation song.
That really means a lot. Oh, and Mom, don't bite your nails.
Y'see, this is where you'd use that 'hello' word we talked about.
Yeah!
Umm, actually I was about to tell you that I was, I was going to get out of it, but hey, if we're just goofing around then uh, maybe I will go out with him.
Well, you know.
What for?
Hey, I just whipped us up some Easy Bake treats, they should be ready in about three days.
Is he not cute enough for you?
Guys, rules are good! Rules help control the fun! Ohhh!
What? It's still going on.
Michael Flatley, Lord of the Dance!
That's not 'til Thursday.
No, you?
Oh... shoot.
All right, hold on okay? First thing's first. Okay, now did Ross sit anywhere while he was naked?
I'm so glad you liked them!
Hey.
It's my new perfume. Why don't you come closer where you can really appreciate it?
So, why wait 'til Saturday, are you free tomorrow?
I can't believe this! This is like the worst night ever!
..Excuse me?
Yes.
All right, it'll be great! You just make her think you wanna have sex with her! It'll totally freak her out!
Wait! What about Joey?
I know, but y'know, this time you're gonna definitely know whether or not you did it!
But no. Maybe if I were baking.
Yes! Have you seen it?
All right, everybody open them!
Nooo!!
Hey.
Yeah sure, nature called, she wanted to see who else did.
I swear, I promise. I promise. Oh my God, I'm so excited! {And I just can't hide it! I'm about to lose control and I think I like it! Sorry, just couldn't resist it.} All right, listen let me tell you, do not get her flowers. Okay? Because y'know, she cries when they die, and there's the whole funeral...
Rachel would be Phoebe's, I would be Rachel's, that way we all get to do it once and no one would get upset.
What kinda things have you been saying?
I know why do you think he was so worried about me getting bigger?
You're right, you're right I shouldn't freak out. 'Cause this is what will happen when you and I have babies! When will that be?!
I love you.
Stop sending food to our apartment.
Oh my God! Oh, this is incredible! Ohh! All right, y'know what? I'm just gonna roll right into that office and-and quit!
Well you should be embarrassed.
That's not gonna work.
Hey Rach, maybe your resolution should be to umm, gossip less.
Yeah! I bet I can do it.
Ok, everybody, there's food and drinks on the table. Go across the hall.
I-I am serious, I mean, we're, we're all over each other all the time.
My god, if I had a nickel for every guy I wish I hadn't..., but this is about your horrible mistake.
And y'know what, I just realised, in the last year I've only gone out with two guys, Richard and Julio. You gotta help me out here, you gotta set me up, you gotta get me back in the game.
Yeah could-could-could you get me something to drink?
I bet this will work!
How's the big anniversary dinner?
Don't you want to look through the rest?
Did you go home and change?
I need more swordfish. Can you get me some more swordfish?
Hey.
Alright, you wanna feel better?
Here's your tea Phoebe.
Bouncy baby, Bouncy baby, Ooh baby baby, Ooh baby baby, Ooh baby baby.
And six others.
I wa-
Hey, you got me, put it in.
Okay, please be good, please. Just remember how much you all like me.
Would you look at them. Am I ever gonna find a boyfriend again? I gonna die an old maid.
I'm-I'm sorry, it's just that umm... Well I-I cook at this restaurant, Alessandro's, and umm I just got a really bad review...
The ones we had right after you almost threw up.
That bastard taped over me!
No-no, I-I really don't want to talk about it! I don't! Especially with you.
Baddest. Otherwise the song would be Fat Fat Leroy Brown.
Yeah, I'm sure.
Uh, you left out the stupid part.
I'm sorry, why is this girl going to call me?
Well, y'know how I always wanted to go out with Chip Matthews in high school?
Some people have been saying its y'know little drops of heaven, but whatever.
Chandler, listen to me sweetie, I know you can do this. Okay? You have a beautiful smile.
Hey!
You invite my brother, you invite my whole family, and not me?! Why?! What-Why wouldn't you want me at your wedding? What could I have possibly done?! Stuart!
I-It's just so insulting! Big spring for a new blank tape, Doctor!
And you're not gonna do that.
Oh my God Chandler! I can't believe it!
Yeah. All right, I'm gonna go tell Dan that it's not gonna happen. Don't do the dance.
How does that laugh not give you a headache?
Have I read it? No, are you enjoying it?
Really? Who's number two?
After the snap!
Hey, Rach, how's it going?
No you're fine. All right well, do you think I could take Rachel?
Sure, we have no money, go ahead.
...They threw us out! I was thrown out of a hotel! Me!
Thank you!
No! We're gonna have fun. We can make fudge!
Okay, he's a senior in college.
I just tell her, I have to get it over with. I told Ross and Phoebe and she's the only one left!
OH GOD NO! Nope, no, no, no. No! No, no. Nope! No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. NO! No!
All right, I'll do it just this once! But you can't tell anybody!
Would you stop?
It's okay. Chandler, are you afraid of me or something?
And did he?
Hey.
What?!
God, you are so lucky. I mean, I mean. . . you know what I mean.
Yes?
Yes... What is the end of that sentence?
NOOOOOOOOO!!!!!
Yeah! She's right in there!
I just wanted to see how it's going.
Hey!
I understand, but you're wishing for what we think you're wishing for, aren't you?
Oh, you're right.
Mr. Bigot. He tells the most racist jokes.
Well, the turkey's burnt. Potatoes are ruined, potatoes are ruined, potatoes are ruined.
Wait, Joey! Joey! That doesn't mean that-that you're in love with me!
No, umm, he met some girl at the coffee house.
Oh God!
Do you not see it?
Fair enough, now go get ready!
Thank you Joey, thank you so much!
I know.
No! Really! Any time Ross makes a toast everyone cries, and hugs him, and pats him on the back and they all come up to me and say, "God, your brother." Know what they'll say this year? "God, you"
It is in the living room where there is also a light! And no one will kick you in the shin.
Just breathe, breathe.. that's it. Just try to think of nice calm things...
My stock, MEG, it went up 2 points. Hey guys, do you realize that if I had invested my $127 in myself yesterday that I'd like have...a lot more than that today. Ya know what, I'm gonna do it.
Okay Ben, why don't you come open some more presents, and Santa, the Armadillo and I have a little talk in the kitchen? There's a sentence I'd never thought I'd say.
I know it's last minute, but we decided to have a Halloween party.
Okay.
Hey.
Well it wasn't my fault, Phoebe was in charge of the invitations!
Hey.
I'm sorry but...nothing.
Excuse me, umm, can I talk to you over here for just a second?
Hi.
Alright, you know what? That's it. You've had your chance.
What?
You know what? You're right.
Oh, look at those little fingers and toes!
Oh my God! Oh my God! You have to go!
Okay, how about the fact that he's engaged to another woman, who just happens to be your ex-best friend?
Chandler!!
Oh, sorry.
Okay, I-I d'know, you-you just- you have a quality.
Wow! So, now you're going on a date with this girl?
How was that possible?
What did the doctor say? Any news on when the baby will come?
Limited seating! Oh, that is such a lame excuse! That's not the reason she's not inviting me!
Where's Benny? There he is! Where's Benny, there he is.
Remember that guy from cooking school I told you about that put cilantro with everything?
Hi!
Sorry, Phoebe.
Oh, I can't. We're throwing Phoebe a bachelorette party.
Hey, see that snippy guy over there? He's the one who decides who gets up on the platform. We should go dance by him.
Chandler has two copies of Annie!
Yeah, I changed them. I-I sent you a fax about it!
Okay good.
But either way... You're gonna get married, you're gonna be happy, my mom's gonna like you better than me.
Oh, I know! Umm, is it because he's always correcting people's grammar? Whom! Whom! Sometimes it's who!
That was not an incident! I-I was gesturing, a-and the plate slipped out of my hand.
Oh, you really want to talk about getting people to like you huh, funny man?
Do you love her?
Wow, you worked in a mine?
Do you want to go out on a date with her?
Oh my God. You're even dumber than I am!
Break!
Sure.
Hi! Hey look who's here!
Why, do you write him a lot?
No, it's okay, not only did I get to go out with Chip Matthews, I got to dump Chip Matthews.
Wow! You might just get the first Nobel prize in rubbing. So what country is this guy from?
I made them!
Is Joey here?
All right. Tell me if this is too cute. Lesbian wedding, chicken breasts.
I can't get married until I get something old, something new, something borrowed, and something blue.
Okay.
okay, Pheebs, theyre gone.
Yeah, I do think it's better this way. Yeah, we're being smart. Yes, I'm sure.
Define fun.
Ah, well if you don't clear this off, you won't be getting one of those from me. But Ben's coming over here tomorrow to play this game, this can't be there.
Chandler?
Ross!
Yeah, apparently they're turning it into some kinda coffee place.
Okay, Phoebe, y'know what? That-that's it, that's it, all right? No dinosaurs, no ghosts, no giant dogs, okay? They're not the right size, they're not Victorian, and they just don't go.
How desperate am I?
Hey. Call me when you get there. Okay?
What? I-I bought groceries, I was gonna make you dinner!
Eldad, this is Rachel.
Thank God! I can't watch him anymore!
No.
Well, I just think the baby would keep falling off the dog. Do you, uh, do you , do you not see kids in our future.
Heeeeeey!
Thank you! 2nd Customer: It was. The duck in particular was superb.
Hey, I know I what I want!
Hey Joey! Isn't that the girl that waved at you the other day?
Hey. Whaddya doing?
Can you believe it? I finally get to run my own kitchen!
I think the things that you said about me are really unfair, and I would like for you to give my bouillabaisse another chance.
No! But, they're callin' out to me! I mean this little guy even crawled up into my lap. Oh come on, Chandler wouldn't mind if I opened just one present! What do you think it is?
I got it.
Okay, this one I like!
What are you doing?
Rachel! Let me in! Rachel!
I promise. Hey, speaking of together, how about we send out a holiday card this year?
Oh that's great!
Was your cabin pressurised?
Between you and...
Bedsprings, unmistakable!
Tim wait!
We'd love too.
: Joey I am not going to objectify woman with you but if her face is as nice as her ass woah mamma.
Are you saying I smell bad?
Hello? Hold on. It's your boss.
I don't know what to say. We shouldn't have lied to you.
And then we're gonna have a little Middle Eastern cous-cous. Something we can eat, with our hands.
Say what?
Hi, Chandler.
What are you doing?
Sure, I love this part!
No, we weren't!
If you're not going then I don't want to go either.
Noo!!!
Ah!
Hey!
Yeah, I guess.
: Is this not the good part? Do you want me to fast forward to something a little toothier.
So I, I told Rachel it was just gonna be the two of us.
I think that is so great! When are you gonna ask her?
What? Honey.
Take me home!
Come in. I've been waiting for you.
Okay, good luck!
Oh God, oh God, I am sorry... I am so sorry...
Remember back in freshman year? Well, Billy Dreskin and I had sex on your bed.
Oh, who cares, they still love me! "I am so excited..."
Sorry.
Stop it!! That's not funny!!
Would it really have been that easy?
You can't be a lawyer. You're eight.
No it's not.
I'm telling you, something's wrong! My brother does not stay out all night.
Okay, come on, I can't get married until I get something old, something new, something borrowed, and something blue.
Oh wait.. What are you doing?
Chandler, that's like your fourth cup of coffee!
Phoebe!
Hey!
It's out on the island. It's in Massapequa.
No, no, no, I don't make chocolate pies. When I was younger I-I enter in this pie-eating contest. I ate so many that just the thought of them made me sick.
I thought you could use the help.
Ya know, I was thinking. Ya know how we always stay at your apartment? Well, I thought maybe tonight we'd stay at my place.
Oh, well, I bought Chandler a five hundred dollar watch and he wrote me a rap song.
It's your birthday!
Well, what did you do?
How did it go?
Okay.
How dirty do you think I am? I'm telling you, if you had some candles and some bubbles and some music, you would love it! It would take all of your stress away.
Yes.
Oh, then go Vassar.
Okay, have you considered using a girl with huge knockers?
Congratulations! Wow! I can't believe you're nominated for an Emmy!
I just talked to Joey, I just-I want to see how you were.
Oh!
Yes. Uh, yes, I did. That was my friend, Eddie Moskowitz. Yeah, he likes it. Reaffirms his faith.
"Take me to the mansion in the sky-y". I am sorry, the song is over. Did you see me out there?
He took off?
I know.. it's gonna be really hard.
She will be after tonight.
You're Lewis Posin.
Oh, it's a great party! Great food. Y'know, most parties it's all chips and salsa, chips and salsa. So umm, what's this?
Hi. I'll be ready in just a second.
Hey! Happy Anniversary!
I'm not your best friend?
Then why would he say it?
Okay fine! Fine! Then you know what, I'll just write about Phyllis! Hmm!
Who's Denise?
Great, now he's waving back.
Uh, wait, backstage?
Excuse me Mr. Mexico.
That's Mindy? Wow, she is pretty. Lucky. To have had a friend like you.
Who? Is that your sister?
What?!
Limited seating my ass. Let's see who made the cut. Hi!
Do you really see this as a long-term thing?
All right, what's going on?
What took you so long?
It might be kinda cool.
Could you not look?
That's ok. I'm sorry I poisoned you.
Hey Pheebs!
Oh, yeah.
Oh my god, where's Emma? Where's Emma?
And?
How's it going with her?
Quick, Phoebe, tell us before he can swallow.
Well, that was weird. You were loud, and I was fast.
Harder than it sounds. Isn't it?
Be that as it may, d'you think you could just help us out here on that monkey thing? Y'know, just for old times' sake? Go Bobcats?
Okay great!
Hey, Rache. You know what we haven't played in a while?
All right, what's goin' on?
How much did ever really win before?
Hey, hey, look. Look Ross, Ben drew a picture of you! Huh? You're-you're a cowboy!
Oh yeah, well there's the possibility that I won't make rent.
I'll be right there!
Honey? Is that something you're making up?
Okay!
Phoebe! You're sick, you shouldn't play. You should just go home, get in bed, and stay there.
Oh sure, now you're Mister Sensitivity. But when you wanted to have sex right after my uncle's funeral.
Whoa! Are you okay?
Yeah with Chandler not getting paid, we could really use 300 million dollars.
Y'know what's weird?
Is someone there?
Of course.
What am I gonna do?! That is the dress! That is the dress! Wh...Chandler wants the band. What do I do?
And, well, don't you have a lot of wild oats to sew? Or is that what you're doing with me? Oh my God, am I an oat?
Yes? ..yes, she is.
Joey!!
I was in too much pain.
I mean I-I don't I think I have enough quarters.
That's just good sense!
Emily's straight.
Aw, I'm sorry sweetie that she doesn't feel the same way.
I am not wrong.
You didn't!
No. Um, I know you like this, and I want you to have it. I think it'll look good in our apartment.
I'm outa here.
I love you. Oh, wait, wait, wait! No hugs. The dresses... Oh what the hell.
What baby?
I'm afraid so.
Oh yeah! What was his superpower again?
Shoot, I think I got mayonaise on you.
No, she's out shopping.
Oh, I'm gonna kill those guys.
Hey, don't mix those up, you could really ruin that lollipop.
Go! Go! Go!
Hello.
Actually, I was gonna do them jullienne.
Alright, I've got a leg, three breasts and a wing.
And you know what? We want a rematch.
Hey! Where's Mike?
Yeah! But, he can't not exactly see Emily, I mean that's his wife.
Oh my God.
Hey Chandler, wanna do it with me?
In that cute, little, sweet way she just did?
Yeah, like I don't know, maybe you have a work problem that you need his advice on.
All right that's it, I give up! Whatever you want you can have it! You wanna sing a song? You wanna do a dance? You want your mom stand at the Alter and scream racial slurs? I don't care!
Yeah.
I love you.
So! He'll understand!
Y'know maybe a little bit!
Oh, sweetie!
Phoebe, it's okay that you don't want me to be your girlfriend because I have the best boyfriend.
Is that that couple on the first floor? Because we should get a baby before them. Yeah! That guy tried to sell me drugs.
Chandler, nobody likes breaking up with someone. You just gotta do it.
Ohh, absolutely.
Yeah...
Well what is it? What is it? If it's gonna help bring the baby here, like today. I mean, I think you should do it.
Chandler!
Yes! Yes! And I think that the first gift that Rachel opens should be from the grandmother of the baby, because you're the most important person in this room. And in the world!
Sometimes I have bad dreams.
I gotta go to work. Has anybody seen my left boob?
I punched you...?
You don't need a shower.
You made it!
She's my favorite character on DOOL.
Ahhh!!
Fine. Go! Go! Go!
This is me in The Sound of Music. See the von Trapp kids?
There's only one.
Lewis Posin! He was my best friend in fifth grade, and-and then one day I asked him to be my boyfriend and he said no. Do you know why?
Hey.
All right, let's go say good-bye.
Okay it's time for the toast! Umm now-now, I know that Ross usually gives the toast, but this year I'm going to do it.
What are you doing here?
Phoebe! Come on! Let's go! Come on! Why aren't you dressed yet?!
So, what's your name?
Oh my God, I went to high school with her. Rachel! Hi!
No, although now that's what I'm thinking.
Wow! It's really red! You should go see my eye doctor.
She's a hooker! She's a hooker! She's a... Hi! Uh, we spoke on the phone.
Do you wanna do it at the same time?
Tomorrow night.
I can't believe Joey's having lunch with his stalker. What i-, what is she like.
Anything larger back there?
Yes, because all good plans start with, "I'll go down the fire escape."
Hey!
I'm still all those things!
Okay, I will. Remember that thing that we just discussed that you wanted to do?
Phoebe, where's your purse?
Great.
So what's Phoebe like?
Does so count!
Okay.
I feel terrible, I really do.
All right. I know you're not happy about us moving, but you're the only one who hasn't seen the house.
Uh, Chandler did! What does he want you to give up?
Hey, did you pick a roommate?
O-kay, so you wanna play it that way, do you?
What?
Yes.
Pheebes, you know what I'm thinking?
Okay, those people just left, come on! Quick! Give him the money and get their table!
Okay. That was her right?
I like them a lot.
Did you ever feel like sometimes you are just so unbelievably uncoordinated?
Right there! That was so fake!
What is that?
: you don't think sharks are sexy do you?
Wait, now so you joined the gym?
What are you doing?
I was probably waiting for it to open.
Oh that's right, that's what I'd sound like if I exploded.
Well, well Ross didn't care enough to be here, so I think he's out. You snooze you lose.
Well, are you asleep right now, Joe? 'Cause I don't think you have to wear it unless you are!
: Honey why don't you just let it go and ask her out again.
Awww, y'know what your nickname is, Mr. Big...
Okay, I'll see you tomorrow! Just so you know, we're not seeing him tomorrow. I-I cannot spend another evening with that man. Do you remember how he behaved at our wedding?
Why did you do that?
Yeah.
What?
And this goes for all guys?
Chasing him all around the room?
Who wants it? Anybody?
Nothing. Just something I want to get Phoebe's opinion on for Valentine's Day.
We have one.
Yeah, but at least I'm doing it!
Well Rachel's not here!
Oh my God!
I know there'll be other houses, but it's just so... I love that one so much.
Yeah!
And Mindy, your maid of...?
I was frustrated with you!
Who's Mr. Girabaldi?
What?!
She's asleep. Chandler?
Well, it's getting late.
Well, thanks.
C'mon!
Alright, I'll tell you what. I'll come get you in 5 minutes with some sort of um, kabob emergency.
Are you still here?
It's a stupid game and I wasn't playing against other people, so technically I didn't lose.
Hold it! Are you talking about Dick Clark's New Year's Rocking Eve?
Hey!
Why do I have to decide?
You didn't.
Sandra, I am so sorry, I thought you were Rachel and we just weren't ready for you yet.
There's something that we wanna tell you. We decided to name the girl-baby Erica.
You still want to move in together right?
I don't know. I mean, you saw him do a love scene, so maybe you don't have a thing for Joey, maybe you have a thing for Drake.
Oh come on, it's only fair, you paid for the flight. Now is, is that enough lire?
What the hell are you doing?!
Look, you and I went to different high schools...
We'll discuss it, in the morning!
That is completely untrue. You think I'm high maintenance? Okay, prove it. I want you to make a list and we're going to go through it point by point!
That's Dudley Moore. I said I wanted it like Demi Moore.
Stop it Chandler. I'm sorry too.
Yeah you will! The right guy is just around the corner! Okay, are we done with that?
Hey! Oh, I'm so glad you're home, I thought tonight we could finally organize these photos!
No, I just I think that it's too soon.
Oh!
Oh, you can have an accent and I can't?! Top 'O the morning to ya laddies!
She's mine!
Oh, I've got it! I have got it! Pictures from your childhood. This will get you going good!
You are?
Hmm.
I still say that if we had called your dad we coulda gotten better seats.
Come here. Okay, be right back.
Wow, come in, have a seat. You must be exhausted coming all the way from...Texas.
Hi Chandler.
Oh.
See? Ben doesn't think you're a loser, he thinks you're a cowboy! Now that's something.
Honey, you've been really strong about this, I know how badly you wanted that job.
I'm Catwoman, who wants to borrow the dress when you're too big for it.
Joey let me ask you a question. What does this light switch do?
Wh-what are we gonna tell him?
I can't believe this, just like 2 weeks ago I was watching Sudden Death, now I'm on a date with Jean-Claude Van Damme. Can you beat up that guy? Can you beat up that guy?
Very good.
Well, given that we forgot to invite her it would be an awfully big coincidence if she was.
Okay, this isn't working. I'm still awake and now I have to pee.
Didn't it drive you crazy to have a switch and not know what it did?
Hello, this is Monica... Yeah??? Oh... Okay, yes, we'll be right, we'll be right down. Thank you.
So why-why wasn't Ross's stuff ruined? And if you say the words medical marvel I'm going to Easy Bake your head!
Chandler that's crazy! If you give up every time you'd have a fight with someone you'd never be with anyone longer than-Ohhh!
This is Rachel. I mean, what are you gonna do, never going to talk to her again? I mean I know it's weird, it's awkward, but you gotta at least try.
Wait wait! I can't sing in front of all these people.
Yeah, I'm sorry. I'm-I'm so sorry.
Chicken? I could eat some chicken.
Wow! You are really fast!
See there you go. Woo! We're out of the woods. Okay, I'll get dressed now.
Couldn't you just stay like this forever? Chandler! Couldn't you just stay here forever?
Thank you. So what does this Bob guy look like? Is he tall? Short?
Nooo! No, that's not true. No, best time ever! Yeah, you rocked me world!
Hey! How'd the audition go?!
But I insist!
Oh my God! Well push it in! Push it in!
Just go over and say hi.
Hey! It's me. Mon-i-ca! Can I just tell you how proud I am of you.
Joey, she was listing the countries she's done it in.
Then I've gotta go. Bye.
You can not play bagpipes at the wedding!!
Inside of telling us you decided to write in your stupid book!
Nah... not-not special enough.
Do you wanna do it at the same time?
You know what? I-I think I'll wait out here.
Ugh, they sent me home. They said I can't work if I'm sick.
Oh good you're all here. Thanksgiving tomorrow, four o'clock. Oh, guess who I invited. Remember that guy Will Colbert from high school?
Hi, uh, Richard it's Monica, um, listen I did something kind of crazy tonight, um, maybe I'm getting my period or something, I don't know. Um, anyway, I, I, I beeped into your machine and I heard a message that, that freaked me out, and um, you know what Michelle will tell you the rest. I, I, um, I'm sorry, okay, I, I hope that we can forget the whole thing. Okay, bye.
I'll get it. Hello. Hi Emily! Yeah, uh you-you tracked him down. Hold on one second.
Oh God, I'm so sorry.
Hi Mr....Bing.
Grand Supreme Little Darling?
Woo-hoo, geeek!
I don't think this number's right!
Hey, Joey, what would you do if you were omnipotent?
Nothing.
Well, if you're gonna be totally rational about this, I can't argue with you! All right? Fine, if you wanna tell him, tell him. I just don't want to be a part of it.
Oh-oh, no no don't worry, I'm gonna wash it.
Well if-if that's what it is, then it's-it's crazy.
I thought I was something that we both wanted!
What?
Alright, we don't know that it's him. I mean, it could be the football guy.
No, I think we should save our china for something really special. Like if the Queen of England comes over.
I can't believe you let them win!
Phoebe, you have to lift it and point.
Well, tonight, I actually went out with Chip Matthews in high school.
Shoot! We're out of soda.
Ha-ha!
Myself. Y'know for remembering to pack a thing. Yeah, you do a good thing, you get a check! My mom does it, I never realised it was weird.
How many perfectly fine women are you gonna reject over the most superficial insignificant things?
Oh, what'd ya bring me?! Awww, hotel toiletries from Japan. Oh, these are gonna go in my permanent collection. You want some coffee?
A monkey. Have you seen a monkey?
Come on Rach, when a guy says he's going to call, it doesn't mean he's going to call. Hasn't it ever happened to you?
All right? What's going on?
I love you too Chandler.
Give me the good stuff.
Hold on.
Hey guys! Do you wanna look at the song list for the wedding? Guys?
I like 'em.
Chandler come on. We have to hem the new dust ruffle.
Oh, about five minutes. Right now they're interviewing his opponent. Apparently he trains by going to Iran and pulling the arms off thieves.
Oh sweetie, I'm so proud of you!
We just want you to think it through.
No-wait-no-no!!!!!!!
Well, next time your massaging him, you should try and distract yourself.
You know what this is, this is us getting ready for the prom.
Me too!
I know.
Is he crazy?! You just had Ross's baby!
Here you go.
Danny? You know Rachel? She's nice. She's not bad to look at, right?
You're right. Maybe I shouldn't go.
All weekend? That's a whole lotta naked.
That's terrible!
Of course you can look at it! Yeah, I want your opinion too!
Joey that is horriable.
Gunther, can I get a coffee to go?
Al-alright, l-look you guys, this is the best relationship I've been in. . .
I tried to reach you at work. There's....been a fire.
Bye... bye... BIRDIE.
Shrill?! The wedding is back on!
Ross, your little creatures got the remote again.
Hey, we would still be living here if hadn't gotten the question wrong!
You know what would be real weird? Is if you weren't there. Just say you'll think about it, okay?
Oh my God! No wonder I get such great service at Cafe Maurice.
No I didn't. I asked, "got the ke-eys?"
Hi Amanda! Actually now... it's... is not a good time. Dinner tomorrow night? Ok, Phoebe and I will see you then!
You thought about that?
Hey!
You keep saying that.
Awww, come on-wait-stop it. Okay, to Monica.
You said you loved me! I can't believe this!
Now, Mom, everything's going fine, really. Yeah, Ross is great. He's uh, he's in a whole other place. No, he's gone. No no, you don't have to fly back, really. What do you mean this might be your only chance? Would you stop? I'm only 26, I'm not even thinking about babies yet.
Phoebe, what, what happened here?!
I'm not really here. Just thought I'd drop these off...on the way.. my way... Do you come here a lot? Without me?
So to get this part you can't be?
Well, I think so.
Does Ralph mumble when you're not paying attention?
This is Chandler's chicken. This is the turkey.
Chandler!!
OK, here you go. Good luck.
Enjoy!
Oh, wait a minute honey.
Keep talkin'.
Did you like her? And I'm just asking as a friend, because I am totally fine with this.
Phoebe, you get the bear, uhm, Joey, you get the robot, and Chandler and I get the dog. Ok, and the race is going to go from here to here. Now the one who comes in last, stays!
Hey umm, what's this?
What is the matter with you?! Do you want to fall into the trap? Do you want to fall into the trap?!
This is insane!
Well, let's just say it's not the first time you've stolen my thunder.
When did I sign for it?
You're mother killed herself!
Oh my God!
What?! You slept with Jason?
Hey guys.
Really?
Well, I just lost my erection.
You're so pathetic! Why can't you just accept it, we're winning because I'm better than you.
Hey, Phoebe!
And ice!
Yes.
Is that all?
I don't, I just, I just like the smell of them. So, uh, what are you really doing here Dad?
Wait a minute...Joey. Joey you can't ask her out, she's your roommate. It-it'll be way too complicated.
Oh, great!
All right then.
She's right there.
He's got something plastic lodged in his throat, we've got to go to the hospital.
Is it the same thing that Chandler had?
Just some stuff for the party.
Ross will do it.
Promise me you'll be careful.
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god!
That's all right.
Come on! Come on, it'll be fun! It'll make me feel so much better.
I can't believe my parents are actually pressuring me to find one of you people.
You guys haven't gotten your presents yet? Tomorrow's Christmas Eve, what're ya gonna do?
But more importantly to full well-rounded lives.
Shut up!! It just got interesting!
Where you can make out with your assistant.
No.
Mm-mh. I printed them out on my computer.
That can't be your father.
Oh..
I'm not crying about that! I'm crying about something that happened at work.
I didn't take a pregnancy test.
You're not gonna be here New Year's Eve??
Oh my God, you're a freak.
It's okay. I suppose it could happen to anyone, not anyone I know, but... By the way I can still see it.
Ok, how about this: We got wind up toys for Emma for her birthday. We can make them race, and whoever comes in last, stays!
Wait, he's not here yet.
Hi, I'm Ross's little sister.
Hi guys!
Just going over my toast. Those two will never know what hit 'em. I can't wait. They're going to be crying so hard. They're going to be fighting for breath.
Rachel always cries!
The three of us?
Are you sure you wanna do this?
If you want.
Oh he's nice. He's nice! Y'know, you always stick up for the people we fog!
Freemont. West-Westmont, ah Westburg?
That's how old you are.
Okay, I just don't get why you like it so much.
You're gonna find a place. But even if - God forbid - you didn't.. So you postpone the wedding. Is that really so bad? I mean, think about it. You could take all the time you needed to get everything that you want. You could have tulips, you could have salmon.... Mmmmm... Salmon!!
Hey, I could've had you if I wanted you.
Okay, just stay there a couple more hours and if she doesn't show up by then, then just come on home.
It's Hexadrin.
This doesn't mean anything, does it?
Hey!
'....Won't you, won't you, won't you.... '
When two people finally realise their feelings for each other, and-and they talk for hours, and they-they learn all about the other person!
That's right, I got mine.
Hey, check me out, I'm a slut!
Oh yeah .
Do you really think marrying someone else is the right answer?
What?
So wait, Ross's stuff is fine, but I have no memories because you wanted to keep the bottom two inches of your car away from water!!!
So'd you guys have fun?
Okay! Okay! Make me sterile, but okay.
So look umm, while we're st-still in London, I mean, we can keep doing it right?
Uch. I am still so mad at you for smoking.
Oh, I love my life, I love my life!
Oh yeah.
Okay, so from now on we have to call you Princess Consuela?
I'm sorry, idea time is over.
Oh, I love this street. The trees, the big front yards, the actual picket fences.
So, what are we gonna do today?
I have no idea.
Mrs. Bing? Here, these are my parents umm, Judy and Jack Geller.
Come here. I'll make you feel like one of the guys. You know for a really cool guy, you suck at foosball.
Sandwiches!
Yeah. I bet you can't guess what color my tonsils are? I'll bet the apartment!
An era is defined as a significant period of time. Now, it was significant to me, maybe it wasn't significant to you!
How are you doing?
Oh, Rach! Rach! Umm hey, could you do me a favor and would talk to Chandler's dad and try to keep him away from Chandler's mom?
I wasn't. Let's get going!
Okay, I'll try.
You're wrong! The centerpieces are fine! Do you ever get scared at all?
How could I be asleep knowing that you were in the next room.
Okay! Wait-wait-wait! Shhh! Okay, umm, I just wanna say that...I love you guys so-so much and-and thank you for being here on my special night. Our special night. I mean it just wouldn't be my-our-our night, if you all weren't here to celebrate with me-us-Damnit!
So you hit her in the face?
Y'know what? Y'know when I said that I want you to deal with this relationship stuff all on your own? Well, you're not ready for that.
Why the hell did you take her?
Is anyone thankful for anything else besides a thong?
Why don't you go see Dr. Gettleman?
Oh, I'm sorry. Of course I mean that. Interesting idea, umm, talk about it, but no.
Yeah, he's gonna work on that.
I promise.
Wait a minute. I thought last night was great.
I know. I need more pie.
Oh, that's Nana, right there in the middle. 'Me and the gang at Java Joe's'.
Phoebe I think he would notice if you didn't have a baby in nine months!
Oh, oh, okay umm, so I'll see you soon.
No, a guy would be saying, "I'm never gonna get to sleep with anyone else." Oh my God! I'm never gonna get to sleep with anyone else! I've been so busy planning the wedding that I forgot about all the things that I'd be giving up! I mean, I...I'm never gonna have a first kiss again.
It's okay, it's okay.
Well I guess there is no harm in telling you now, Rachel and Ross are gonna have a baby.
Rachel umm, I was just talking to this guy and I think he'll have sex with you.
Okay.
Because! You could get to live out my fantasy!
Really? The scientist guy?
Oh, god help us.
I don't know who I'm happiest for...
They're all Chandler.
What are you doing here!
All right, I still need a calamari and a Caesar salad.
Yo, Bing. Racquetball in 15 minutes.
No! We only mess around at his place!
This baby has got everything. Take y'know, locations for instance. First, organized alphabetically, then geographically, then by square footage.
Okay, d'y'see anybody you think could be me?
Oh my God!
Thank you.
What, what are you doing? You can't go out there.
Sounds like she's got the ah, whole package.
Wow!
Hello? Oh, hi Wendy! Yeah, eight o'clock. What did we say? Ten dollars an hour?... OK, great. All right, I'll see you then. Bye.
Look at us all dressed up for the big office party! By the way, what are we celebrating?
Ennnh.
You just asked me.
It is not over because she is going to call you and tell you she loves you. And the reason why she couldn't, is because her feelings were so strong, it scared her. Now you go home and wait for her call, she could be calling you from the plane! Come on now go! Go!
Uh, look, officer... uhm Sir...
Hey.
Well, this must've brought back some really bad memories for you, Ross.
What?! You're crazy! There's nothing sexual about the noises I make!
Hey!
That's also like the tenth time you told us.
I'll try.
You remember that video I found of mom and dad?
Ah, yeaaah!
Now, are you glad we didn't start with the bikini strips?
What kind of social situation are you comfortable with?
I hadn't! Photo 152 was a prototype.
So this is it, we're really gonna adopt?
Did you make brownies today?
Soon! I-I just couldn't before. You saw how upset Joey got! I couldn't do that to her, she's my best friend!
What?
Thank you.
Thunder being stolen!!
No Chandler no! No unscheduled stops. You can go when we stop for gas.
Okay. Umm, y'know, I don't think, I don't think I told you this, but umm, I just got out of a really serious relationship.
Ross , foot on the floor or come over no more!
We're gonna have sex.
You know it's funny, the last time Paulo was here, my hair was so much shorter and cuter.
It's clearly an Emma.
Ohh come on, I love this song! Come on, you'll be fine.
Hey, don't say that! You got just as good a chance as anybody else of getting that job!
Haven't we made this decision?
Rachel, that's all we do.
I-I'm the head chef. I-I can't get promoted.
What?
I'm just so glad you got to see the babies.
Honey, what is the Bruce Springsteen CD in the Kat Stevens case?
Chandler is supposed to find out if he's getting an assistent job at his ad agency. But out of the 15 interns, they are only hiring three.
This is so wild. Ya know, I gotta admit, I was kinda surprised that you agreed to go on a blind date.
Look Rach, we have to move. I mean if they had lost, we would've made them get rid of the birds. Right?
Which one is which again?
It is nothing like the Hobbit. It's like reading about every relationship I've ever had, except for Richard.
Oh please! Yesterday on the subway? You couldn't stop staring at that woman with the big breasts the whole time.
No, actually, we're buying the house next door.
Okay! Oh God, y'know what? It's really bad.
Well do you love him?
No.
Ok, thanks for coming, I hope you guys had fun.
Rachel, get the book! The book!
Oh. Can I have a tissue?
Cowboy boots? I've never worn cowboy boots in my whole life!
Thats not how you see me, is it? Phoebe while cutting a sweet potatoe in the air: No you're all about the fun.
This is so unfair! She's got everything I want, and she doesn't have my mother.
I know.
Michael.
What?
Then I won't have to kill you.
Oh, you're so sweet. Oh, but wait, what about our, what about the future and stuff?
Yeah.
Honey, you don't have to do this.
Same category?
Ooh, Phoebe, you look great!
That's right. That is right, you go over there and tell her you don't want her to live with you. Do not take no for an answer!
Okay well I think...that's your answer.
Hey.
What?!
Oh man!
Did not.
Wow, isn't it ironic that David would show up on the same day that you and Mike exchange keys?
It's like two miles!
That's not a question.
How do you feel?
Ross didn't scare you?
And I would have to say pah-huh.
Oh-oh, no no don't worry, I'm gonna wash it.
Dad, Chandler was just laughing at your joke.
Y'know what's weird?
Yeah. Go over to Joey's. Go over to Joey's and drink some beer and hammer up some drywall.
Oww!
Men are such idiots.
I'm quitting!! Woo-hoo! I'm okay!! I'm all right!!
Yes it is! You saw me wearing it!
Are you guys gonna be okay?
Phoebe come here.
Yeah, the best you got in high school was Wet Pants Geller.
Well you let me know if you can, because y'know I can bake a pie to cover it.
Joey's bare ass!
No leg-chewing for us sir.
No.
Was he crying?
Dr. Burke, it, it's me.
Hey, look at me. I'm making jam, been at it since 4 o'clock this morning.
Hey.
No, it's not.
You see that guy? He's in classics now, but y'know as soon as we leave he's going straight to the porn.
Oh. I'm sorry it didn't work out.
Hi!
Phoebe!
Yes!!
Oh I love taking limos when nobody died!
Well, actually, I'm already seeing someone.
I know, I've been looking at those doors, they look pretty sound proof, don't you think?
Are you trying to tell me that we're moving to Oklahoma, or that you're gay? All right, not that this matters, but did they at least offer you a huge raise?
You know, when you start get screwed over all the time, you gotta switch to low-fat.
Well then get it, get it!
When?
Hey.
Wait a minute! Now I'm betting against all three of you?
It's easy! Just keep it casual! Give him a kind word, shake his hand and give him the money!
Let me ask you a question.
OK. Just for a little while.
Okay, the red ones are my guests and the blue ones are yours.
Yeah. In fact, I like her so much you tell her I want my cookies early this year! Y'know, a box of Thin Mints and some Tag-a-Longs.
Oh my pleasure. Okay, I'm afraid I've got some bad news. Phoebe!
Honey?
Aww, sweetie, but it's not like you're not gonna have anything. You're gonna have nieces and nephews, and some ways that's even better.
That's my pie!
To the bank.
Okay, can we change the topic? Because it's really doing nothing for me.
Oh, so much fun. But the best part is, we met this incredible couple on the way back.
Who did we fight in World War I?
Just subtract twelve.
Oh yeah, what's the plan?
This is for the scratchy twins out there. I taped oven mits to their hands.
I wanna buy 5 shares of SGJ and I wanna buy them now. C'mon time is money my friend. Thank you. Wooo.
Hey, this afternoon you said you'd be supportive...
'Cause I don't want to encourage this kind of behaviour.
A pie!
Absolutely! Now get out of here you!! Okay, I'm running out of places I can touch him! Look, is there something wrong with me? I mean why am I only attracted to guys where there's no future? Either they're too old, or they're too young, and then there's Pete who's-who's crazy about me, and who's absolutely perfect for me, and there's like zip going on! I mean, seriously, does it sound like something's wrong with me?!
Chandler! Phoebe's hogging the game!
Ohh, you are such a good boss! Is she pretty?
Curry.
Ugh, she's upstairs not doing the dishes! And I tell ya something! I'm not doing them this time! I don't care if those dishes sit in the sink until they're all covered with-I'll do them when I get home!
You're not just saying that are you?
Phoebe!
Hey.
Yeah? The work problem?
Hey, we're probably fertile, let's go home!
Yeah. What is that?
Jeez! What is with you?
Okay, great!
What?
Why would they think they're invited?
Ok, three kinds of potatoes coming up.
Well then somebody's snoozing. Joey, not that this uh should affect you at all, but if you were to pick me, I was planning on wearing a sequined dress, cut down to here.
Yeah, am I in it?
So, um, how-how did you guys meet?
Spoon? So, what do you think?
Ok, I don't wanna be negative so I'll say that most of the signs you bought are good.
That was the adoption agency...
The players.
Not that bad? Did you hear the hammer story?
It's harder for me! I have those four other women to compete with!
So you gave in and decided to call someone?
Oh God!
Let's see, today's Monday... Never.
We heard about your pants, I'm so sorry.
It's very interesting, Phoebe.
No! No-no! I love it! It is a great present! In fact, why don't you go home and wait for the thank you card?
Why can't you use the phone in here?
Wow! That Mike thing was interesting! I don't know what's gonna happen with Phoebe and David.
Would you stop? We've only been going out a couple of weeks, I mean we don't even know if he's gonna propose.
Well actually, I-I didn't eat mine. It's still in the bathroom.
No.
Why did they get divorced?
What?
Wendy, we had a deal! Yeah, you promised! Wendy! Wendy! Wendy!
Yeah, I don't hear Chandler's and he doesn't hear mine.
That's weird. I've had the same number of beers as you and I don't feel anything at all.
'Cause, Gary and Phoebe think they're a hotter couple than we are!
You're an opthamologist.
Oh my God! That's my restaurant, I'm the chef there.
No, Rachel never pees in public restrooms.
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
Why don't you phase it out? Yeah, fade the accent out and people will think you're, y'know, that you're adjusting to life in America.
We checked. A lot.
You're the most incredible woman I've ever met. How can I lose you? Now, I don't actually have a ring...
Ohhhh!
No honey, I'm sorry, but the weekend's not over yet.
I know!
Of course not. I mean gosh, Chandler what you did, it's, it's a wonderful thing and I really appreciate it. I know I have this weird thing where I want everything to be in the perfect place, but I'd never expect you to worry about that.
Yes!!
Hey.
Oh my God! Oh my God!
That's true.
Great!
The wedding starts at six.
Okay, Chandler, you go first.
What are you doing with the lamp?
No that's, that's okay.
Don't worry Joe, I won't come next year! Joey: What have you got there?
Aww...
Oh my God!
He's in a different room! He's really that loud?
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.
Here, let me show you. Okay, the towels are hanging next to the sink, and umm, you can use the fancy soap.
Well maybe I'm ready now. I mean, it's a little scary, but maybe it's right.
Not really.
Gotcha. When do we tell them about this?
All of us.
Because Purvry Perverson over here can't stop staring at her.
Oh yeah? Well when you learned how to dance did you forget how to put on underpants?
But that's clearly a joke. This could easily be true.
Yes!! Yes! Yeah, yeah, yeah!
I hope she's OK.
Phoebe, what is it?
Okay, this is the den. All right, check this out. Lights! Whoa! All right. Less lights! Bad lights! Lights go away! Oh, see you just need to find the right command.
Phoebe, do you think that your favorite animal says much about you?
I guess Joey was right, it does nothing.
Every year.
I think you look fine.
Chandler gets pedicures!
Alright, wait a second, why would Ross tell everyone in your class that you are as... "gay as the day is long"?
And when I told her that I was gonna be moving in with Chandler, she was really supportive. You were so great. You made it so easy. And now you have to leave. And I have to live with a boy!!
Let's just do it right now. Okay? It won't be hard. Just say what's in your heart.
We are not going to whistle.
Yeah. I'm okay. I'm actually-I'm a little cold, can I have your jacket?
Ohh! Did you do what I said? Did-did-did you tell her?
Okay!
This is kind of a classy place.
Groomsman, groomsman, why are you just standing there, where is your bridesmaid? We've got a broken arrow. Bridesmaid down! Oh, that's me.
Chandler! He's your father; he should be at the wedding.
Okay.
Oh, thank you!
Hey Rach, remember that great song, Me, Myself, and I?
I really wanna have a baby.
Hey guys!
Hi!
You didn't hear the speech!
What?!
Y'know what, I'm gonna hold her head.
Oh it's umm, good! It's umm, it's good, just here watering the plants.
You got a present for my parents. That's so sweet.
Vividly.
I feel really sad that we're not...really there anymore.
Very!
Hey!
Well, umm, Walker was looking for this big bus load of kids.... All right, I get your point.
And Joey.
I just thought that if I could follow the wire I could find out what it did.
Hey, are you okay?
I know! I know.
Huuh, alright, Danny Arshak, ninth grade. Oh, c'mon Rach, you know the bottle was totally pointing at me.
Oh my God, he's gonna do it now. Please, I cannot watch this, let's go.
Yeah!
It's never taken you more than a shower to get over a relationship.
Chandler what do you say?
Excuse me?
Phoebe, I did not have sex.
You know what? It seems like you've been making an awful lot of stuff Irish lately.
Them?! Who's them?
Did you just smell my hair?
Ross married Rachel in Vegas! And got divorced! Again!!!!
Nice to meet you! My God you're great!
Damn it, I did not think this through!
Thank you, Pheebs!
Yay!
Oh Soap Opera Digest award!
Ross, are you okay?
Oh my God!
Rachel, you and Mark?!
Yes! Carol and Susan's caterer had a mountain bike accident this weekend, and she's in a full body cast.
...And then we throw your body in the water... Gee, that does sound fun.
Which one?
Pete.
What?
And the eye!
Come on! Come on, if we have sex again it'll double our chances of getting pregnant. Do you think that closet's still available?
Ross, cough drops, please?
It says "Do it!". And behold she did adopt onto them a baby. And it was good.
Yeah, she hates all mass produced stuff. She thinks her furniture should have a history, a story behind it.
Yes. I hated you. I mean I, I, loved you in a 'you're my brother so I have to' kind of way, but basically, yeah, I hated your guts.
I can cook and you can take care of the money.
No fair. I don't even have one. How come they get two?
Oh wait, wait, unless you happened to catch the Reruns' production of Pinocchio, at the little theater in the park.
Well, if you don't have anything to copy, why are you going down there?
Hi.
Uh, no. Loosely translated 'We should do this again' means 'You will never see me naked'.
Nothing, just never seen you in little stretchy pants before.
I'm gonna go to the bathroom, maybe I'll see you there in a bit?
Didn't your dad used to call you Pumpkin?
I don't know, I lost it all ok. I lost it.
Hi! Umm, I'm Monica Geller, I'm the chef at Alessandro's.
I've never loved anybody as much as I love you.
I don't think so.
Oh, it's perfect.
That is the unusual activity. Look, they just wanna see if you're okay.
Stop it, stop it, stop it!
Your a poet and don't know it.
I didn't mean to cut it off. It was an accident.
Oh my God! What were you doing in a library?
Why would we do that?
Sweetie okay. It's okay. Everybody made it to the wedding. I'm fine.
Hey Rach, come on! We're gonna be late for the eye doctor appointment!
It's okay, 'cause y'know what? You don't really need me for the business.
Jeffery.
See Chandler? I'm getting a lot of use out of them already! They're very practical. See, you can wear them with dresses, with skirts, with pants...
NO!!!
Chandler, if you thought I was going to get you porn for Valentine's Day... you were right! Apparently, it's about a young girl who moves to the big city, you know, in search of stardom, but ends up having sex with a lot of guys! Yeah, it got four starts! Oh, wait a minute. Those aren't stars. Anyway, you want to take a look?
What's up?
Man, man that is sharp. It must have cost you quite a few debloons.
: what's the big deal, you forgot, she forgot, maybe you were having an off night.
Ugh, we're screwed, aren't we? You know what? Just tell me on the way to the bird store.
Oooh, I wish she could stay here, but Chandler is allergic!
But my apartment!
Oh my god good?
Chocolate-chip pancakes!
Oh, what are we gonna do! I don't wanna see her!!
Calling Dr. Big, Dr. Big to the bed.
Oh, what a great argument, exhaling! All right, y'know what, I'll prove it to you, okay. I'll trade you Joey for Rachel, and I'll still win the game.
Okay.
Okay.
Hah!
Toothpick?
Yes, a relationship. For your information I am crazy about this man.
Oh, I so can't believe this! My uterus is an inhospitable environment? I was trying so hard to be a good hostess!
I thought it might be true. And I was afraid that you were gonna cry and then show it to me.
What are we gonna do?
That's not your regular dry cleaners.
Um-hmm.
Of course!
Oh, thank you. Would you like a tour?
You have got to go home!
She was like 30, dark hair, attractive.
I am scrappy.
Ow, what are the chances!
Well, I'm sorry, but Chandler and I could really use a weekend away. You know, to reconnect... emotionally.
Shut up.
He's coming. Be cool, be cool, be cool.
Know when to stop.
Okay.
Who's David Lynn?
I'm not gonna go out with him.
Yeah, well he's my brother! And plus he drives so slow he could never hurt it.
I don't think I'd care.
What about your massage client?
In the beginning where y'know it's all sex and talking and sex and talking and...
Joey, where are the Jell-o shots?
007 has a fancy car!
What?!
Nice! Wow Phoebe you are good!
This is so bizarre. I guess it kinda makes sense though, y'know she had such a terrible childhood.
Chandler, we still haven't gotten an RSVP from your dad.
All right, that I'll retract. But I stand by my review, I know food and that wasn't it. You're marinara sauce tasted like tomato juice! You should serve it with vodka and a piece of celery.
Really?!
I get the dollhouse!
What?! What honey?
I don't know, Chandler. Let's take a look.
Well, unless goose is a vegetable...ha haaaah!
I know. I just wish that once, I'd bring a guy home that they actually liked.
Oh my God yes! Who is she?
No!
Limited seating?! I am just one tiny person!
Well I'm Monica Geller, ball like a baby.
Oh my God!
Here we go again.
If only there were a smaller one to clean this one!
Oh yeah, what are you reading?
Phoebe, I thought you said you know what you're doing?
Oh. What's wrong?
Hey, you guys!
Are you okay?
God, Ross is on a date with your sister! How weird is that?!
I feel terrible.
Oh, that is so sweet. Oh gosh, love you. Insurance?
Oh, is that so? Ok. If that's really what you want, then here... I give you the headset. Well, I don't really want to give you the headset. Well I guess if you're taking over, you should probably return these messages.
Yeah, I'd really like to.
Um-hmm.
Excuse me, where are you going?
Okay, bye.
Can you hear me say "You're grounded"?
I'm sorry. But not that sorry, 'cause you don't have to live with it. Um, we have a reservation under the name Chandler Bing.
What is wrong with you?!!!
Good! Now, take those salads to table 4, And you! Get the swordfish! And you! Get a haircut!
What?
So we're gonna try? I mean, are we trying?
Oh, look, he's waking up!
Ah-ah-ah, now you started this, you will finish it.
Oh...Rach!
I'm gonna miss you!
We're okay. I'm still ovulating.
Alright, for the bizillionth time, yes I see other women in shower at the gym, and no I don't look.
Hey Joey! Aww, you remembered even though you're a big star!
Ross, is he gonna live with you, like, in your apartment?
It's enough for wedding scenario eight.
Joey, promise me something.
Y'know if it's any consolation, he really did sound like he was having more fun with you.
Don't you have to pee?
Okay.
You stink!
Yeah.
Oh. So nice of her to pull my hair, 'till I dropped the key!
Oh! It was our pleasure. We are so much enjoying getting to know you.
Poor thing!
Yeah, I know. He can get really competitive.
What kinda stuff?
Y'know what? I'm gonna make this up to you. I promised you a stripper , and you're gonna get a stripper.
That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong. Y'see, he's the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born.
All right, just trying to start an interesting discussion.
Ohhh, Chandler, sorry! Hey, Janice.
..I dunno, a little too Alan?
Hey! There you are!
Okay, can we please go eat?
All right, let me see. Will Chandler have sex tonight? Don't count on it. Seems like it works to me.
That doesn't seem fair.
Yeah! Okay, this one is a mushroom cap. Umm, this one is made of bologna.
Listen umm, I've been thinking, it's not fair for me to ask you to spend all of your money on our wedding. I mean, you work, you work really hard for that.
Oh-ho! But not in here! Can't eat 'em in bed, remember? No crumbies!
Oh please, he didn't hear it! He didn't hear it!!
C'mon guys, it'll be fun!
Oh my God!
Oh my God!
That's much better.
Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- -I'd want yours.
Me neither.
: really?
What?! I-I-I don't, I don't do that!
Yes! Absolutely. Okay? Look, you'll know it's mine because on the right cup, the lacey part, there's a very noticeable rip.
Hey!
Okay.
Because it's my apartment!
I don't remember. Do you wanna take a walk?
You what?
Are you kidding?! I practically spent my entire childhood at the arcade! This is like-Oh my, this is like my second favorite game!
What? I don't see anything.
Thank you. All right, now who else do you want to invite?
Oh and you know what I want!
I drew you a bath!
I'm sorry that I made you stop seeing him.
Oh, is everything in the car?
Deal!
I'm at work, ordinary day, you know, chop chop chop, sauti, sauti, sauti. All of a sudden, Leon, the manager, calls me into his office. It turns out they fired the head lunch chef, and guess who got the job.
Ohhh, oh my God! Oh my God! She knows about us!
So um, who was she?
Don't you love the huge yard?
Oh, no!
Let's take a walk. Y'know maybe you should consider writing for Talking Out of Your Ass magazine!
Hey Frannie, welcome back! How was Florida?
Ross, I thought you were over this.
I saved you a seat.
What?
No I'm not sure that it's the best way to hear everything. Someone get me a glass!
It's coming from the living room.
If it is a new message, what is he calling to say?
Oh Ross, sometimes grown-ups have commitments they just can't get out of!
I mean, who knows how long it's gonna take for someone else to give us a baby? What if, what if no one ever picks us?
Then what is it?
Oh no! I don't know anything about cooking. I had to ask someone what it's called when the, when the water makes those little bubbles.
It was a mistake. Please don't take this to mean anything, because it doesn't.
Are you saying that you don't wanna get with this?
Bye.
Hi, good morning lover. I gotta say after last night, I'm a little weak in the knees.
I kind of have to don't I? Because of this stupid thing.
Three down knows I'm married, what's three down doin'?
Okay! Why?!
No Phoebe I am mad!
You-you're gonna have to put your foot down?
Oh, my mom called, they're gonna run our engagement announcement in the local paper, so we're looking for a good picture of us.
Yeah.
I'm in love too! But in an orderly fashion.
There are no jobs. There are no jobs for me.
Bye! Ten bucks says, I never see that woman again in my life.
Yeah, like you're gonna be pregnant. I mean pregnant.
So have you called her yet?
Well, you just-you put a quarter in and y'know pull-pull some handles and win like a candy bar or something.
Hey, they don't pay me a penny a word to make friends.
Oh, yeah, that's true.
You're doing it again.
My pink flowered bra! I recognize the strap!
Come on Rach, let's go.
We are the hottest! Huh? No one is hotter than we are! You're the best.
Man's got a point.
You didn't find her?
No time for that!
Well that's the best part. Umm, you guys get to decide!
She's a stripper.
Oh, here's a great one.
It was great! It was great! How about you?! I mean you're having a baby!
Oh my God!
Yeah.
Bunny!
Well, I thought that I would cut up the tomatos.
With a wok? I thought you were going to read my boring book to put you asleep.
Yeah, and I wanted her to get to know the doctors and get settled into the hotel.
I can not see him? I mean, you can't tell me what to do!
Hey!
Did she leave a number?
Ya know, my party is fun. I mean, maybe it's a little quieter, less obvious sorta fun but, you know, if people would just give it a chance...
No, seriously.
I know that you're new at this, but this is completely unacceptable bath decorum.
Phoebe, that is awful!
You're meeting Richard?
I can't leave it! You gouged a hole in my dingy floor.
Mmm-mmm.
What?
Well, now's a good time. I'm on my way to have my ears cut off.
Right! .. but we "know" what you're wishing for!
Yeah, I think you should keep looking!
: maybe I will go yea will have a second honeymoon at the Tulsa romana.
I know!!
Joey!
Yeah. Don't do the dance.
That's a good idea.
All right umm, a string quartet for the procession.
How have you been?
Bye bye Mike!/Cya mike!/Bye mike!/Bye bye now!
Y'know, there's a Starbucks about three blocks down.
Ross, can I?
Y'know dad, Chandler is one of Ross's very best friends!
Ok, hypothetically, why won't I be married when I'm 40?
Julie.
Alright, well, maybe I should let you and the second prettiest girl in Oklahoma get back to work.
: then why were you watching them and giving YOURSELF a treat.
I'm sorry..
That counts!
That cold makes you sound so great.
Have you guys picked a date yet?
Hi.
How many?
Is it a good play?
I was.
Phoebe!
I'm sorry, but that's my happy place.
Oh yeah, she didn't hire me out of pity, it wasn't so she could pick on me in front of her friends, she actually thinks I'm good.
Ok people, we are back in business! Oh God, we've missed you soo much! Ok, go and get your hair and make-up done, and I'll take care of everything.
He is right, isn't he?
It sounds interesting!
Oh my God, it was incredible.
Haha!
What about all the guys that you've got the phone numbers from? Why don't you just kiss one of them?
I am not!
Wait a minute! We're talking about someone that I'm going out with?
No, no, not a party. Just a surprise gathering of some people Rachel knows. Um, this is Phoebe and Chandler and Joey.
Hi. Uh, we'll be right there, we're just trying to decide something.
Brrrrrrr!
I'm sorry, they surprised me. There was nothing I could do!
You broke up with a girl because she was fat?!
I'm fine now, but it was really scary there for a while. I mean, someone slipped a-a threatening note under the door.
Yes but my mom got me this job.
I think so.
Because your all gonna make up fake specials and make me cook them like you did the other night?
Phoebe, you have a, a twig in your hair.
She's in the bathroom.
Why do you guys have so many keys in there anyway?
The only problem!
You think we're being obvious?
We can't split them up!
Viva Las Gaygas!
Hello? Hold on please. Joey, it's your mom.
That would be a good idea.
Never done that before.
No one.
No it's not. We had an inspection and they didn't find anything.
Of course it was! Trust me, when it comes to psychology I know what I'm talking about. I took two psych classes in college.
Chandler?
Eww!!
Sush!! I cannot believe she is still up there.
So, I read this article in the paper the other day that says you're not supposed to throw rice at weddings, because when pigeons eat rice it kills them.
They're in the kitchen getting something to eat. Can you believe how nice they are?
Nooooo. You're really not going?
I wanted to do this days ago so I think I should go first.
Is that the one that speaks English or the one that doesn't?
Is he doing his shark attack bit yet?
What's going on?
She pulled it out of me! She's like a conversational wizard! How'd it go?
Is that why he's acting so weird...? He's jealous...? Oh my God, that is crazy. It's not like I'm attracted to Geoffrey...
Ross, thats my jacket.
Mira, Ross, Marcel se llevo el control remoto.
Hmhmm.
Look, Phoebe!
All right!
Bye.
Oh, Larry.
What are you talking about? We're all together right now.
Oh my God!!! What are you doing?!!
You know what, I think it's cute, you trying to be more like Richard.
He didn't die. I saw his daughter last week. Said he was fine. Her on the other hand, botched Botox.
Please, have some!
Are you a virgin?
Why?
Look, doctor! Look, before we sign anything we really have to talk... We're not who you think we are.
So, Phoebe runs weird huh?
I know! And four ninety-nine for a pillow top queen set, who cares about the divorce, those babies will sell themselves. And I'm appalled for you by the way.
C'mon give me five more. Five more.
Nope, she's perfect.
Well, you're-you're sweating.
What?!!
This is so great! Now we can enter into doubles tournaments!
See? This is exactly why I'm making this candy. We can learn their names and get to know our neighbors.
I know! I know! I know!
Hey, Rachel, Can-can I see you for a sec?
Oh, y'know..
Umm, wait! Do you want to set the mood a little?
Yes, I'm sure! Rachel is there something that you want to talk me about?
They're still in my coat.
Hey wait a minute, this one isn't dirty.
On three, 1...2...3! Now my pillow's all wet!
Oh wait, Joey, you can't go like that! You stink!
Y'know what? I-I don't want a big, fancy wedding.
Hi, Ben. Hi. I'm your Aunt Monica. Yes I am. I'm your Aunt Monica. I...I will always have gum.
Oh, play them!
No you can't. She's yours!
Chandler, I think I'm sick.
Yeah, well I don't think it really counts if you have to read them off the back of your hand after you fall asleep on the couch.
Yeah, it did.
Yeah! Do that!
Yeah, I'm sure your ex-wife will be more than happy to move to another country so you can patch things up with your new wife.
Oh May 15th.
No time for that!
So maybe they could umm, call the award the Monica?
No, I-I haven't seen your pink shirt.
Hey!
No.
What?
You don't even know me...
What?
It's the salts.
Do it!
Wait! Wait! Wait! You can't start today! Today's the rehearsal dinner!
Oh, Rachel, sweetie, look, here's a really cute picture of Joey and you at the reception.
I love you!
Really? Your work laugh?
Like?
Hey, you touch that and you will be sorry.
Oh, wow, can you believe you're like three weeks away?
Yeah.
No, no, wait. His flight doesn't leave for another forty-five more minutes.
I know the code to his answering machine.
Believe me, Chandler and I have not seen each other in over a week. We'll probably be the first ones there.
Pretty much.
What?
All right.
Hey, do you realize that at this time tomorrow we'll be getting married?
Anybody tell you?
Oh! Do you need me to go with you?
Oh, it was awful. I guess some people just don't appreciate really good food.
People are supposed to wanna hang out here!
Me and Chandler?!
Wow!
What's goin' on?
Sit down.
We don't have much time. Once the egg descended the oviduct ...
Chandler, here you go, got your traditional Thanksgiving feast, you got your tomato soup, your grilled cheese fixin's, and your family size bag of Funyuns.
Hey. It's three in the morning. They don't know that I've come home yet. You notice how neither one of them are wondering where I am.
Believe me, that is not why we won't be doing that!
Hey!
No. No. Not it. Not it. Not it. Don't crowd me! This is it! This is the dress! Oh my God, it's perfect! I'm sorry, this one's taken! Whoa!
In the bank.
Honey! Do you know that none of that stuff came from me?! I mean I never said I wanted to have babies and get married right now!
Are you freaking kidding me, Green?
He would just roll me over and I would stop snoring.
Did you ever, uh, like, think about the future?
I love you so much.
And I can't stop you.
Ohh that's sweet!
You owe me 20 bucks.
Then you two can, can sneak into the cockpit, and things will start to heat up, and then a stewardess comes in... I've been watching too much porn.
There's nothing we can do. You erased the message!
So, maybe I am a little high maintenance. And maybe Rachel is a little bit of a pushover. But you know what we decided you are?
Yeah.
Would you look at her? She is so peaceful.
Ok, for my next song I think I'll sing something a little more upbeat. All right? Oh, how about the PointerSisters "I am so excited". And make it bouncy!
Uhh, y'know actually I was gonna do some laundry.
No, of course not. It's not even an issue. Cause I told him I was 22.
YOU BET YOUR ASS I AM! I just had the best first day ever! The kitchen: twice as big as Allessandro's.
No. Not after what happened with Steve.
Yeah? What does she think of your little science project?
All right then, your bra would still be big.
Oh, can I borrow this? My milk's gone bad.
Nooo!
You know, they're not actually supposed to have... I'll work on the lumps. Joey, you're going home, right?
The dinner will be ready in twenty minutes. This is so exciting.
Oh my God, I love how thin these walls are!
No no no, if I couldn't pay you back right away then I'd feel guilty and tense every time I saw you.
Ok..You know the old classics you know,You look nice? They're still ok.
One.
Oh, okay!
Y'know what, you can play with my dollhouse.
I'm Monica Gellar. Who do you know the bride and groom?
So she's a woman! So what?
I think it's totally insane, I mean, they work for the hospital. It's like returning to the scene of the crime. You know, I say we blow off the dates.
Alright, but I'm very excited about this OK, so you gotta promise you won't get all big-brothery and judgmental.
Oh my God! Ross, are you in England? Was Emily surprised?
Okay, how much?
Bye plates!
Did she really say that?
It's 2101 and I am not amused. . Ok, the bride and groom have a few words they'd like to say.
What are you doing?
I think she's here.
So! I'm just an empty vase, huh?
Look, I-I'm never gonna let you up so you may as well just go away.
The big hat, the pearls, the little pick handbag.
Yeah, we'll be okay.
Ok, there's enthusiastic and there's just plain gay!!
You were staring about eight inches south of there.
Okay.
Well, maybe you should send him something. So that when he gets to Las Vegas he'll know that you're sorry.
Oh no! Did you take my bra too?!
Wait, you like them with me.
Honey, listen... You have nothing to worry about with Geoffrey.
You made a joke right? So I laughed.
Not just the phone pen. I never get my messages.
Yes! Why, did you-you forget to make yours?
I know!
Okay.
Okay, it's baby time. Pants off Bing. Didn't see you there Geller.
Hey, aren't you up next?
Two girls and a boy?
YE-AH!
Listen, uh, you told me something that was really difficult for you. And I, I-I figured if you could be honest, then I can to.
Okay, umm, okay, umm... It's just Joey and Ross.
Oh, look! Acting for Beginners! Want to feel good about yourself?
You know how much I love listening to your music, you know, but...
Okay, look, this is probably for the best, y'know? Independence. Taking control of your life. The whole, 'hat' thing.
Let's see. Congress is debating a new deficit reduction bill... the mayor wants to raise subway fares again... the high today was forty-five... and- oh, teams played sports.
I know... it's just... I thought this was, you know... it.
It's wrong. You know what else is wrong? Phoebe picking Rachel.
Joey?
Okay. Let us start with the A's. Advertising.
Somebody likes you!
All right, let's be practical, if Ross isn't willing to do it, he's not the only guy in the world you can have sex with. You can borrow Chandler-Chandler is good!
Oh...
Will you stop!
What a minute, what did he say?
Oh my God, what are you gonna do?!
Hey! Didn't you have that outfit on last night?
But, I put some honey in it.
Because Armadillos also wandered in the desert?
I-I-I'm sorry, your-your mouth was full, I didn't hear what you said. Umm, hats off to who now?
For this weekend! Oh gosh, it would be perfect, we get to see Joey plus we get to start our anniversary celebration on the plane. We can call it out plane-aversary.
My dad told me. They play golf together.
You know what. Tomorrow I'm gonna do your clocks.
Oh, is it that pinball machine with the big bow on it?
It's "Bolero" from "10".
A-ha!!!
All right, come on guys, let's go! Tie score, and we're runnin' out of time. Forty-two!! Thirty-eight!! Hike!
Nope.
Hell yeah!!!
Ooh, umm, oh Kathy! Kathy, I love you! Oh!
I know!
Hey, did you get the turkey basted-Oh my God! Oh my God! Who is that?
We are going to Dick Clark's New Year's Rocking Eve!
Worked like a charm.
No! I was just getting into position and then everything went dark.
Oh.
Dammit, dammit, dammit!
I can't believe you thought I was cheating. You own me an apology.
Oh my God. Phoebe. Don't look now, but behind us is a guy who has the potential to break our hearts and plunge us into a pit of depression.
I would get a room with this cake. I think I could show this cake a good time!
That is never good.
Sure, every time, you're such a princess...
Really? I'm really tired of being your relationship tutor. You're gonna have to figure this one for yourself. All right? Y'know what? If you're too afraid to be in a real relationship, then don't be in one.
What?
Finger cramp. Oh God, sorry. Here, let me get that mom.
You know that's nice, y'know we could put it back there after the surgeons remove it from your colon!
Okay, let's go!! Let's hit the road!!
It's nice to meet you. Janine...?
Yeah?
Well...it's just umm...I'm afraid you might mess it up.
No. He's not a horrible guy.
Here you go!
Helloooo? Yeah. Oh my God. Thanks.
And I don't know if you've noticed but she's a HOTTY!! HI!
I'm gonna go across the hall to check on the yams.
Ross! He's playing with my spatulas again!
Oh yeah...So how did you end up kissing?
How'd you pay for them?
She said WHAT?
Put the plates in the boxes!! Put the plates in the boxes!
Oh my God! Oh my God that's awful! What did you think of the house?
Alright. Just keep him away from me.
Yeah! And if, and if we have a baby one-day, and the doctor hands it to you in the delivery room and you don't cry, so what! And-and-and, and if we take him to college and come home and see his empty room for the first time, and you got nothing, it won't matter to me.
And who pays for that?
Okay? Over here we have pink suede, which is nice. But umm, if it gets wet then you know it's gonna shrink.
Oh, hey! Oh good, you brought food!
What are you smiling at?
Big time!
You have nothing! You're not even going out! You're her baby sitter! You have a 12-year-old girl's job!
Okay, great! Bye. So guess who's coming to Thanksgiving dinner?
But ehm...what is it not?
And you would?
Ok, you have to stop playing now.
But the minute we start to lie to each other... And by 'we' I mean society.
Oh-my-god Rachel! Rachel!
You okay?
Yeah, just like the one in the poem.
Why? Because everything is my responsibility? Isn't it enough that I'm making Thanksgiving dinner for everyone? You know, everyone wants a different kind of potatoes, so I'm making different kinds of potatoes. Does anybody care what kind of potatoes I want? Nooooo, no, no! Just as long as Phoebe gets her peas and onions, and Mario gets his tots, and it's my first Thanksgiving, and it's all burned, and, and I... I...
Ooh, I want one...
I can't belive it, I'm gonna be an aunt. I'm gonna have like a nephew.
Ok, it is definitely less than a ballpark.
Hoyt?
Oh, gosh, I'm sorry.
Is that a bit you guys do?
Okay, fine I admit it! I feel terrible! Would you please rub this on my chest?
Love is the best medicine.
Oh, please, that is such a lame excuse!
No! You have lasagnas!
Huh.
Careful. Careful. CAREFUL! Sorry.
I don't know.
Wait Chandler, what are you doing?!
You start working on that list.
Hi!
Uh well that depends, how are things with Phoebe?
I love you, too.
Absolutely! Yes, you say to him "I'm sorry Mike I can't live without her, she means too much to me!"
Do you think breaking up with him was a huge mistake?
Thanks!
So you're moving in with him. What happened?
Water rules!
Oh no-no-no, it's still me.
Rachel's really the one who's pregnant.
Yeah! That's why I'm sleeping with him on the side.
When you get a sec, another round of daiquiris.
Yeah, is that okay?
What?
Where's that?
My surprise party!
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I-I should probably leave you girls alone.
Regular or decaf?
Then you'd be going back and forth all the time, I mean it doesn't make any sense.
Hi, Nancy. Hi, it's Monica Geller. I'm good. Listen, I'm looking for a job in Tulsa. Well yeah, my husband has been relocated...Because I love him! No, I don't want a job in New York. Javo is looking? Oh my God! He asked for me personally? Oh my God! Oh, wow, this is really flattering, but I'm moving to Tulsa. Yeah, so if you would tell Javo 'I'll take it!'
Chandler! You're home!
Why?
Wow! Your lip went bald. Hey, thanks.
Come on. I know you're not eighteen anymore, but give it a minute.
That didn't work on mom, it's not going to work on us.
As a thank you, Rachel and I will kiss for one minute.
That'll teach you to lick my muffin.
OK, what're we gonna do about this?
They love my candy? Oh man!!! I've gotta go make more!!
Manhattan.
Doesn't matter, I'll get 'em tomorrow. Or not. Whenever.
All right Rachel, you sweep behind, I'll pitch it to you, you throw it down field to Phoebe. All right. Break.
Now see, this way you protect the plate.. and lets face it you have fun.
Oh y'know what? If you're gonna be acting like this all night, I really, I don't even want to be around you.
Chandler!
I don't know how any of these got opened?!
Just like you told her you did! ... Just pointing out the irony.
What's the matter?
Y'know what, this is obviously some kind of twisted joke she's trying to play on him.
This is so great! And I'm gonna be your baby's aunt!
Hey!
Well, no, not at all, you're not terminal, you just, you just need some damage control.
Ohh, I'm such an idiot. I can't believe I actually thought she could change.
Hey, have you figured out a way to tell him you're moving out?
Hey, Rach, you're leaving tomorrow, shouldn't you be packing?
You say 'Thank you very much,' and then you buy me something pretty. Come on, we're gonna put are hands in this bowl, and we're gonna start squishing the tomatoes.
I don't believe in soul mates either.
Oh..please!I-I welcome criticism. 3rd Customer: The musician right outside the restaurant...it's kind of a mood-killer!
Absolutely.
In one year?! My God what did she eat? Her-her family! That's not the point.
No you robot!!
I don't need an actual man, just a couple of his best swimmers. And there, there are places you can go to get that stuff.
Huh?
I thought you were going out with Elizabeth.
OK LET'S GET THESE CHAIRS OUT HERE! Gunther, hit the Christmas lights. Okay, who left the ice sculpture ON THE STEAM GRATE?
Ok, that's enough.
Huh?
You too.
All right, I...I have to ask.
Anything but stew.
I know!!!
How did that happen?
So it looks like it's going really well for you two, huh?
All I have is, is oregano and a Fresca.
You are just the sweetest.
We said six!
No, it's not!
Oh, I'm glad. Listen, I want to apologize about Chandler, though. I just did not see this coming.
I'd like to have Don and Phoebe over. Wouldn't that be nice?
Okay, I freaked out a little.
Wow, he's really not letting this go, is he?
Oh yeah, right.
Think about it.
Oh, just some pictures I made and hung up. I thought they'd brighten up the place. They do don't you think?
Phoebe!
Okay. Phoebe that's it. Come on, get out-out of the chair. Get out! Oh come...Phoebe!
Hi.
Hm-hmm!
Oh yeah! I saw her walkin' it down the street the other day. She had uh, these flowers in the basket. It was so cute.
It's worse. The only thing that's getting me through is knowing that I'm gonna be seeing you soon. I think I may even try to get out of here early.
Wow, all you need now is The Killing Fields and some guacamole and you've got yourself a part-ay.
We should get over there and see if she's okay. Just one...second! Score! Game! Come on.
Oh God! What did I just step on?
If you really want to watch that Serengetti thing, you can.
Can you just hold on for one minute?
I mean don't you trust her?
I don't know!
What if they get mixed up?
I can't answer that! Chandler's my husband.
That was you?!
Okay, if you need the vacuum, it's in my closet on the left-hand side. Ah, the garbage bags are next to the refrigerator...
How did you get in there?!
Great!! That's great!
Oh my God!
Oh, come on.
I'm sorry...
Yeah, I asked you and Phoebe to pick up the pies. You did remember, right?
I was trying to help out a squirrel.
Forget it. Not after your cousin who could belch the alphabet.
What?
What?!
I don't understand, I mean am I so hard to live, is this why I don't have a boyfriend?
Ross, you've got to do something about the humping.
Okay, I'm not getting this!
Nope. Going to the Big Apple Circus today.
I can't walk. Okay? Okay? These boots were a huge mistake!
What's 'pleh'?
Okay, I'll be back in just a minute. Oh, Phoebe I'm sorry that I left lipstick marks on the phone.
Hey, Rach, did you make your money?
Wouldn't you be?
You know what? Then, Joey, we want you to do it.
I was just waiting for the perfect guy.
Wow. Joey, how do you do it?
Hey sweetie.
Don't worry. You'll find some place to get married.
Besides, it takes the focus off the hat.
Here's the plan! Okay? I'm going to leave you get a look at Brenda's bra!
God, I'm sorry! I'll go back and get it!
All right, hand me that other box of photos; that's the very last one.
Oh, wait, and I got a beeper!
I don't have her number, butt-munch.
And I assume, Chandler, you are still boycotting all the pilgrim holidays.
Well, instead of being sad that tonight is my last night together with Rachel we thought we'd go out to dinner and celebrate the fact that Rachel is moving in with Phoebe.
Abso... ...lutely. See, I love creating new recipes. I love Thanksgiving. And, well, now, I love Mockolate.
Honey, I'm going to put my hand in your pocket!
Wait wait wait. I was at home the whole time. How did I missed that?
No, you said the baby creeps you out.
Strip Happy Days Game?
All right, but if-if he lights someone else on fire he is out of there!
No he's not!
Woah, woah, woah, let's go back to 29.
I am not high maintenance!
Nooo! Okay. Whoa! Okay. See I was, I was a little nervous about turning thirty. So the bus boys took me out for some drinks. I wanna puke on you later!
And who laminated it?
Hi.
Um... hi there.
Game!
I knew you were likely to take a wife!
Umm, can we see you ride it?
Look at that! Look at that! They're going into the first class lounge! Do you know what they have in there?
Ok listen, you go down to the pool and reserve the chairs, and I'll get the magazines and the lotion.
Wow, Monica! What an amazing opportunity to influence... dozens of people.
It's not a date, okay. I'm just gonna teach him how to make lasagne for some pot luck dinner he has.
Maybe Joey doesn't have to give you the money, TV stars have assistants right?
Now, open your eyes.
This is so great! This is exactly how we set the plates at the restaurant.
Oh, hang on, hang on. Does Aunt Monica get a say in this?
You obviously haven't screwed over a lot of your friends. Which we all appreciate.
Who? Who do you know that are friends that just fool around?
Oh that's my doodle of a ladybug, with a top hat. She's fancy.
I can't believe that this whole time we thought he hated us. I mean, isn't it amazing how much you can touch someone's life, without even knowing it?...Would you look at this dump? He hated us. This is his final revenge!
Stupid.
But Chandler lent you money!
Yes, he is. Me.
Hi, again.
Wafer thin ice!
Did it ever occur to you that I might just be that stupid?
Hey! Good luck!
You don't have the guts.
Wow! That is a great picture!
Oh please! Dad turned my room into a gym 20 minutes after I moved out! I gotta say, a tanning bed and a stack of Victoria's Secret catalogues, not a gym!
No. It disappears back there behind that baseboard. For a minute there, I thought it went downstairs.
I used to love to play restaurant.
I can't believe it's raining again! Oh, it's so unfair!!!
There's no man in here. How dare you accuse me of that.
Chandler there's nothing wrong with crying! I mean you don't have to be so macho all the time.
In.
We're kidding. C'mon, tell us!
Come on, hurry!
Now everybody knows the basic erogenous zones. You got one, two three, four , five, six, and seven!
It's supposed to be that small. It's a pre-appetizer. The French call it an amouz-bouche.
No, it's not bad. It's not bad at all. It's-it's really nice.
Okay!
Rachel, if you want the little round waffles, you gotta have to wait until I find the little waffle iron.
Really?
See what happens when you give people advice? I hope you told him not to?
See, didn't I tell you?! You're getting over Ross already!
So, let's do this.
So, are you sorry that I told them?
I love the "I forgot the present" fake out!
Hey, Rach. How was it with your friends? Okay! How would you like some Tiki Death Punch?
Y'know what really bothers me? Is-it's how-how different you act around them! I mean y'know the throwing the tennis games, the fake laugh, the "I'll see you around, Bing!" "Not if I see you first, Doug!" I gotta tell you, I don't like Work Chandler. Okay? The guy's a suck-up.
: Ross?
No, they were really cool. They were on their honeymoon too!
Please... honey, leave the details to me. Now I wanna make this day as special for you as I can. Now, ok, I was thinking that the harpist should wear white.
Chandler, I'm gonna die a virgin!
Oh how nice. Maybe later we can all go blow our noses on my wedding dress. Ross comes out of the guest bedroom with the diaper bag and the car seat carrying thingy.. yeah.. thats the techinal term.. He goes to Chandler.
The fake kind!
Soakin' up all the culture.
Okay!
All right relax Mr. I've Had Sex Four Times!
You hand-wrote it?
Okay.
What is it?
All right Rach, for what it's worth, I think that you're doing great. I mean y'know let's face it, no one handles this well.
Yeah, I mean yeah, I look great. Yeah, I feel great and yeah, my heart is not in trouble anymore! Blah, blah, blah! Y'know I still don't feel like I got him back, y'know? I just want to humiliate him. I wanna, I want him to be like naked and then I'm going to point at him and laugh!
Look. Joey, do you know we can see you from here?
As much as they love you?
See you guys later.
Chandler! What are you doing here?
Daddy?!
So, if you're parents hadn't got divorced, you'd be able to answer a question like a normal person?
Can we have our drinks please?! Waiter-Uh, tress!
Well, uh y'know, our guy works with Chandler and he's really nice and smart and he's a great dresser!
I don't have an atlas.
Guys. I thought you were taking Ross to the game?
Yeah I do rock that one.
Put all my money in me.
That's what it says here. Flight 421, leaves at 8:40, Newark airport.
Nancy doesn't smoke!
Of course there's another guy!! This is even more perfect! Now you have to prove your love!
You read comic books right?
I'm not touching you.
Well, it's a set and they should probably stay together.
I'm actually with her on this one.
We're all sorry...
Come here. I can breath through my mouth.
Son of a bitch!
She's living my life, and she's doing it better than me! Look at this, look. She buys tickets for plays that I wanna see. She, she buys clothes from stores that I'm intimidated by the sales people. She spent three hundred dollars on art supplies.
No, that's not it. It's just that when we were asking him all those questions before, I just... I just realized I don't care if he's the most perfect guy in the world... he's not you.
Hi!
Bite me.
I wasn't escaping.
I'm gonna go to the bathroom, maybe I'll see you there in a bit?
Well, my breasts are going to get bigger weather you like it or not! And you know what? It's not just my breasts. My ass is going to get bigger too.
