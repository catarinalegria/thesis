Then talk to him! He might be fine with it.
Oh thanks!
Yeah, hi, I was just beeped. No, Andr is not here. Third time today. Yes, I'm sure... No, sir. I don't perform those kind of services.
Yeah, what're you guys doin' here, aren't you supposed to be Christmas shopping?
She's not even here yet.
You go get 'em. What did I do to you? Did I hurt you in some way?
You're welcome, Ben. Merry Christmas, ooh, and Happy Hanukkah!
There you go! Good enough for your party, huh?
What?
Ross.
Seven.
It's a girl! Anyway, it wou-it wouldn't matter. Okay? Because I'm a teacher and she's a student.
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa, Joey!
Well, do you wanna marry him?
I don't know what to do. What am I gonna do? I mean, this, this is like a complete nightmare.
Okay.
What are you doing?
This is crazy! I mean, yes-yes Rachel is my good friend and I-I have loved her in the past, but now, she is just my wife! Phoebe, will you-will you help me out here?
Hi!
Hey, you wanna get something to eat or uh, do you wanna see how long we can throw this ball back and forth? Huh?
What? What's on your shoulder?
Me too. Come here.
I don't know, but when I spoke to her, she said she had already passed the mucus plug.
I just wanna read something. It's your pro list.
Do not rush me!!
Alright, I panicked, alright? She took me by surprise. You know, but it wasn't a total loss. I mean, we ended up cuddling.
Could ya just, could ya just lay off, please? All right? My life is an embarrassment! I should go live under somebody's stairs!
Wasn't it? And you thought it would be awkward with Joey and that you never really liked Rachel.
There's no seatbelt!
Huh. That's a really pretty name for-for an industrial solvent.
Yeah, I'm a friend of Rachel Green's. Uhm, actually we met at the Christmas party about two years ago.
Mm-hmm..
What-what do you mean?
You-you-you-you threw my sandwich away!
No, but it is frowned upon.
Wh-what did he say?!
Okay. What ah, what is the matter with you? What's going on?
That's it? That's all you wrote? You're the worst writer in the whole world.
You're drunk! Mom and dad are gonna be maaaaadd! Maybe I'm a little drunk.
Anyway, suddenly I'm down field, and I realise that I'm the one who's supposed to catch him, right? Only I know there is no way I'm gonna get there in time, so I am running, and running, and that, that is when I woke up. See I, I am so not ready to be a father.
Oh! Ah. Aw!
Oh-ho please. Ask her how?
C'mon, tell us.
I'll get it.
I was working late in the library one afternoon. It was just the two of us. She needed some help with her word jumble. And one thing led to another. If you must know, Anita was very gentle and tender. May she rest in peace...
Ok, um, uh, more clothes in the dryer? I'm fine, I'm fine.
Okay, hopefully this time mom won't boo you.
Umm...
Four hundred, huh? Well, that sounds do-able. How much are the boxes?
Oh yeah, Emily convinced me to do it.
I got it.
And that's just the herbivores. I'm not even gonna discuss the carnivores, their heads are already too big. Which is ironic considering their stunted cerebral development.
And everyone's telling me, you gotta pick a major, you gotta pick a major. So, on a dare, I picked paleontology. And you have no idea what I'm saying, because, let's face it, you're a fetus. You're just happy you don't have gills anymore.
Hey, say something to Emma on her 18th birthday!
Total wuss!
Yeah. It would've been good if we had gotten in, but still real fun.
Joey!
Right. Okay, let's play. Let's go.
Well, this is what happens when people live on the edge!
Of Ross and Rachel.
Look, it was accident! Okay? I-I feel bad that it happened, but I swear, I didn't even watch it! Anyway, here. I thought you might be more comfortable destroying it yourself.
Yeah...
No. No.
I just-y'know-I-I just have one-Rachel?!
'Cause otherwise they'd have to call it the room room.
My nana used to do it. That's how she paid for all my dance-karate lessons.
Do you realise that man has cried in our apartment three times...? Huh? I haven't cried that many times since I moved in.
Whoa! Hey! Whoa-whoa-whoa, you saw her breast?!
You see, and you thought she'd be judgemental.
What happened?
You take your time.
And thank you, for that.
Actually umm...
What?! You're in love with her.
You gotta be at least bi...
Oh, but I've got tickets to the Van Gogh exhibit! I've been waiting like a year for this.
Joey! You're in charge, ok? You make sure nobody leaves!
Everybody put their balloons down!!! Now this is a nice suit!!
Wait! No! Ben, come here! I am not kidding!
Sure, we don't live there but...
Oh, I'm sorry, no. He did ask me one. Uhm... How do you spell Mboscodictiosaur?
What?!
Well, I'm going to take off. Congratulations man.
Oh for cryin' out loud!
Did you talk about the night of five times? Do you tell people about the night of five times?
Rach!
You know the song! Sing along!
OK, I need to lie down.
Fajitas! Be careful, very hot plate, very hot plate!!
Ohhh. Big boy, riding the bus--Hey, I have a question. How come it says Property of Human Services on his butt?
Yeah, well you should! I mean, nude pictures of Anna Kournikova? I mean, she's never even won a major tournament!
Yeah, I still don't know. I'm sorry I just wanna make sure that I bought the right couch. I need a couch that says, "Kids welcome here." But that also says, "Come here to me!"
That's it? You're not mad? I mean, it must've been terrible.
Just showing you my run-of-the-mill-slice-it-right-off third nipple.
Oh, no, it's great. It's great. He is... He is an amazing guy.
Oh no! It could be better, but it's gonna be okay, right?
I... ahem... I really don't think so.
Seriously?
Oh my God! Rachel Green?
Hey, I thought I cheered you up.
Pop it in.
Give daddy the Barbi! Ben, give, give me the Barbi. Okay, how 'bout, don't you want to play with the monster truck? No. Okay, oh, oh, how about a Dino-soilder?
It's my joke.
I... I don't know..
Practical jokes.
Well, aren't you forgetin' something? What, what, what is uh, what is that guy's name? Dad!
Look, don't worry about me. Okay? I'll just stay real energetic and stay away from the ball. I'll uh, I'll be that guy right out of the circle.
Hey, I was looking out for you.
Alright, alright, you know how you say I never seize the day? Well, alright, even though he's your super, I'm seizing. Mr. Treeger, here is 50 bucks, merry Christmas.
Doorknob! Doorknob!
No-no.
Wow.
Really?
Emily, hi! Uh, how-how was you flight?
Hi.
No. No. Nothing happened. I shut the drapes to uh, show her slides of my favorite fossils.
Ok, ok! I'm gonna go hide! Oh, this is so exciting, my first mourner!
Alright, you know what? You're right. I should at least tell her how I feel.
It could happen.
Yeah, no, you're right, I know, you're right, I'm not, I'm not gonna do it. All right, thanks guys.
Wow! Kind of uh, kind of a full house here. I'll guess just...I'll come back.
Uh, uh, well you're, umm, you're my lobster.
Come on. These people'll scooch down. You guys'll scooch, won't you? Let's try scooching! Come on. Come on. Uh, Kristen Riggs, this is Carol Willick. Carol, Kristin. Uh, Carol teaches sixth grade. And, Kristin, Kristin... ...does something that, funnily enough, wasn't even her major!
Okay!
No, you, ya know there's no need to make it u. . . how?
Emma.
And, I love you!!
No!
Know what-If somebody doesn't tell me what's going on right now...
All right, I see what you guys are saying. I'll uh, I'll go downstairs and fill out an application.
Well, how was the date?
Oh yeah! Wasn't she uh...
Dude, I was gonna ask her out.
I see your twenty, raise you twenty-five.
No. So what. So what if we get beaten up, maybe that's just something every man has to go through once in his life. Ya know, like a, like a right of passage or somethin'.
How do you know? I mean we thought Carol was straight before I married her!
Please take your time, it's an important decision. Not like, say, I know! deciding to marry someone, this is about a muffin.
Did you say something?
Okay.
Crazy!
So you don't wanna go to Williamsburg?
Fine.
Yeah?
Let's give it a shot.
Forget it, she's destroying it.
Hey, what are you doing shopping at eight in the morning?
Hey, y'know what and if you're looking for a place? I just heard in the elevator this morning that a woman in my building died.
I don't want to do that.
Yeah, and-and thank you for Emily.
Okay, uhm... Hey, you guys seen Joey anywhere?
