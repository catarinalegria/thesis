Oh no wait, oh no, the elastic on my underwear busted.
Well, can you dance at all?
Sure!
Getting so good at that!
Hey. I need an atlas! I need an atlas!
Where? Ooh, come to Momma.
Three? You guys were worried I wouldn't even have one!
Oh don't do that.
Joey, I just think you're getting worked up over nothing. This is probably just a crush.
And that's Judy over there at the bar with Emma?
Oh, in that case--Yay! That was me hopping on board.
Feel better?
You're thinking about this way too much. Just tell him and get it over with. It's like, it's like ripping off this Band-Aid. Quick and painless, watch. Oh mother of...See?
No-no I can't! I can't let you do it!
Hee hee!
Hey.
Ursula! Wait! Err-err, it's me! Phoebe!
Ross, please! My make-up!
Hey. Ooh, look at you, dressy-dress.
You mean the time you broke the ketchup bottle and cleaned it up with Monica's guest towels?
Here.
Oh my God!! No! What?! Help me! Let me out! Now!
Um, perhaps. Yes! Yes, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I was just afraid that you were still hung up on my sister.
Thank you.
Hey, you guys, listen, this weekend we're all gonna go to Las Vegas to surprise Joey! Including me!! You wanna go?!
Well, he wants to do some ecclectic, so he's looking for someone who can, you know, create the entire menu.
Why??
Oh, yeah, oh, I'm sure of it. You should just do it, just sweep and throw me.
Okay.
Yeah, come on. You know you want it, you know you want it too, come on. Let's just be bad, it'll feel so good.
It's, I mean, it's nothing, I'm fine. It's my friends. They-they have a liking problem with you. In that, um, they don't.
So how did this happen? Did she, did she lure you to an early bird dinner?
Ooh ooh, we have a live one!
No-no, we do it every year!
You got problems because of you! Not your name! All right, this has got to stop! Chandler is a great name! In fact-yes, I'm, I'm sorry. I know you really wanted me to name the baby Joey, but eh, so, I'm-I'm, I'm gonna, I'm gonna name the baby Chandler.
Yeah, well, y'know maybe you just need to try a little harder!
Today we're gonna start with some songs about barnyard animals. Oh, the cow in the meadow goes moo, Oh, the cow in the meadow goes moo. Then the farmer hits him on the head and grinds him up, And that's how we get hamburgers. Nooowww, chickens!
Man alive!
I cannot believe I can't find a selfless good deed! Y'know that old guy that lives next to me? Well, I snuck over there and-and raked up all the leaves on his front stoop. But he caught me and force-fed me cider and cookies. Then I felt wonderful. That old jackass!
A-ha! And... what is bluffing? Is it not another word for... lying?
Ooh. Oh. It looks like, like a tiny little person drowning in your cereal.
You guys, um I know that this really doesn't have anything to do with me, but um I love you guys too. Oh, I really needed that.
Do you really like it?
Oh! Oh my god. This is so exciting. How much am I gonna get?
Hey Ross! So listen, about you and the dinosaur girl, are you really just gonna let a couple of Nobel prizes scare you off? What is that, come on, a piece of paper?
I can't believe you... ..did this.
No, but it is fast. Isn't it?
You were fantastic! I'm so proud of you!
Hey, what's going on?
HEY! Mike called were going out again! YAY! YAY!
Ok, look, before you even start, I'm not denying evolution, ok, I'm just saying that it's one of the possibilities.
David, I'm so sorry, I'm sorry.
Bye!
I was in charge of cups.
I know. I know, what's her number?
Okay, yeah, so it's not gonna work.
This is the happiest dog in the world. I borrowed him from my friend Wendy. Now, you can only keep him until he cheers you up. And he will cheer you up!
Wh-why is that the best part?
Okay.
Why not?
Hey. Guess what! My landlord just called and my apartment is gonna get ready soon, so I guess I'll be moving out.
Well, I'm not gonna be the only one who's not getting paid.
Pastrami.
I'll have to get back to you on that. Okay, bye! Oh my God! He wants me to come over and feel his bicep and more!
Okay, can you really tapdance?
Yeah.
Oh, do you need a hug? You don't have to bring me anything!
What are you talking about?!
We're all right.
I know.
Oh yeah! I'd let him check out my kitchen floors.
A bunch of stuff. And the worst one... he wants me to get rid of Gladys.
Oh my god.
Wow! Nice! Manly and also kind of a slut.
Yeah.
Okay!
Oh!! That's my new thing. I figure bodies at peace, make peace.
Me taking care of you is no problem, huh? You guys feel safe. Right? Okay, I'm gonna take that spit bubble as, "Yeah, I do!" Okay, after I get rid of this dirty diaper Leslie, I'll set you up with a clean one. Okay, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you. I just have to clean that up. Okay? 'Cause let's face it, we're at Monica's. I broke it. All right. Well, that's just the way that goes. Okay, good. Why are there only two of you? Where is Leslie? Well, you can't answer. Leslie? Where are you Leslie? Leslie, now would be a good time for your first words! Well, look at you! Hey! You are a little bit mischievous! My gosh! Oh, you're a lot mischievous! Well, it'll dry. Okay, you sit with your brother and sister now-who aren't there!
It's Phoebe.
Yes! .... or no.
Bamn! There you go! Huh?
Okay, come on Rach it's present time! Y'know you're the glue that's holding this whole party together. It's kinda falling apart here.
Tomato tart and which of the pastas would you recommend?
So great! Okay! Tomorrow we're gonna drive out to Montauk.
Yeah.
Listen Ross, we ran out of gas, and we don't know where we are, so we can't get a tow truck.
All right, you know Paolo?
They went in together. So sorry.
What? Is it - is this 'cause of what Ross said?
Yeah. Okay.
And-and a power tie?
Yes. Well, that's neither here nor there.
Yeah. Oh, can I come?
Okay.
Didn't you sleep together?
Okay, whatever. Y'know what? I don't have time have time to convince you because he's only here for four hours, and I'm gonna go see him!
Well, it's just that maternity clothes are so expensive.
What if we don't find him somebody else? We'll just tell her the date's off, but we don't tell Ross, and he goes to the restaurant and gets stood up!
Hey.
It's okay, he's a virgin.
Then he comes over! "I'm so worried about you." Uck! Be a man!
I'll give you $1 for them.
Damn it woman, pull yourself together! Have some pride, for the love of God.
You mean whenever Monica and Chandler where like y'know doing laundry or going grocery shopping or-Oh! All that time Monica spent on the phone with sad Linda from camp!
She's gonna say goodbye to each of us individually.
That woman at the game didn't know what she was talking about. Mike, obviously you have balls.
Ohh, get a room.
I would love that job!
Maybe the overlords needed them to steer their spacecrafts.
These are her earrings.
Oh! okay. Wait, are we in Joey's imagination?
Yeah. Why aren't you with Rachel?
Let's see! Oh, you know who's great? Sandy Poophack.
Oh, I wasn't even thinking about that.
Good.
Well, if you don't... if you don't hold it in, you don't get all the nutrients.
Yeah! As long as it's free! Food here is ridiculously over-p... Phoebe: Who's hoping the hand raising thing is still cute enough that you won't hate me?
Wow! Hey, why are you all dressed up?
Oh hi Rita! Good! Oh, Rita's a massage client.
You're making one right now!
Yeah, think so. Oh! Huh. Whoah.
Nah-ha!
Okay, so it's probably just the Ross thing then.
Nothing, you just have to be cool with it.
There he is! There he is!
Well, if you don't know I can't help you.
What?!
Oh, it's Ross on one of his drives!
Yeah. You won't be able to take it.
No, I made myself take an oath. Yeah, no fooling around with clients and umm, always be prepared. Yeah, that one's actually from the Boy Scouts, but it just makes good sense.
Yeah! So you're gonna call this one back?
Oh no! Oh! Wow!!!
Ok. Um, so does your guitar have a strap?
Yeah.
Hey!
Stating the obvious, but thank you. And it's not weird is it.
Yeah, uh-huh, a 100 dollars.
Yes, Denise. Denise!
Um, Chandler, Ross, this is Robert.
I know. I know. I know. I know, and if you try to make it more you might wreck it.
Hey.
I can't believe that! Now the only thing left of my grandmother's legacy is this crumb. I wish you a long and happy marriage.
Well, maybe it's so big because the house was built on radioactive waste.
I brought a bunch of stuff for the house, so check it out. Ha-ha.
No!! Hey-hey that's not a Nutter-Butter, that's just an old Wonton!
Well look-look, okay Ross, Kyle just told me some really bad stuff about her.
Well, we both have.
Okay well, he would turn things to gold.
I brought you my old maternity clothes!
'My scones.'
Okay, I know. Hold on. Hey Ross?
Not for you.
Who's the father?!
Never.
Bye!
Well, I hate to eat and run, but...
Hi!
Yeah, we all know! We talk about it all the time!
I like this lily. It's more open, ya know, and that's like my mom. She had a more open, giving spirit. Ooh, Foghorn Leghorn, ooh.
Oh, look at these! Hey, Ben. Just do it. Oh my God, oh, ok, was that too much pressure for him?
Uhuh, uhuh... Oh my God! This is really happening.
Well, yeah.
Well, there's a spot open for only one groomsman and you have to choose between Ross and Chandler. So good luck with that.
Uh-huh.
Bye-bye! That's why I moved out.
Well, because we thought you knew!! It's so obvious! God, that would be like telling Monica, "Hey, you like things clean." Or, y'know, "Hey, Joey, you're gay."
Oh, okay, I'm sorry, thank you for my azzz.
This is so cool!
Sure! What?
Why don't you just try one?
Hey!
No! No! I just went to pick up Phoebe Buffay's checks; there were a lot of them.
Is that Ross?
That is so you!
Well then get your money back and return them!
Who, Josh?
That's it. Just relax.
Yeah, it's... Y'know there's-no you may not!
You're just so mean to each other! And I don't want to end up like that with Rachel. I still like you!
OK. Oh Monica! Guess what!
Thanks.
You're not? See, that's why you're so great!
Thanks. Okay, now go away so we can talk about you.
Wow! Big day huh? People moving in, people getting annulled...
All right.
I knew I should have married Chandler.
Although, don't feel like you can't visit.
Uh huh! If it's a girl, Phoebe, and if it's a boy, Phoebo!
Yes, but there isn't always time!
Monica, you don't know that.
All right well, we're just gonna have to tell Monica, that's all.
Okay.
Ready?
YEAH...! How great is this...?
Yeah, and these are my friends. People. This is Vince, Vince the people.
So what's going on?
Sting has a son that goes there too!
Oh yeah! Yeah, no, we're gonna connect, y'know bond, and everything.
Wait, I think I know someone who does that.
Yeah that's right you are so busted. Book 'em.
You're on!
What am I sitting on?
Okay, so The Plaza! Okay, we'll get us some Mai Thai's, maybe no more for you though.
Oh wow, three hours and still no baby. Ugh, the miracle of birth sure is a snooze fest.
Yeah! I mean, I don't know. I was just , I was looking, I was looking in his eyes and I was just thinking: Oh my God! It's David. David's here. He's just, he's so irresistible.
Yeah. I guess she hasn't seen everything yet. I'll be right back, she has to go to the bathroom again. Oh, such a pretty face.
Yeah.
Enter Pheebs.
You guys, there are people in there who are not getting any happier!
Okayyyyy, open up!
Not yet, no.
Well let's just hope it works. Y'know nine out of ten marriages end in divorce?
What are you, what are you doing here?
He's just trying to show Joey how much he means to him.
Ow! Ow!
But I don't. Me, Phoebe.
"Geology rocks!"
How do you know?
Ohhh, I wanna come over there and give you a hug and wish you luck on your wedding, but I don't-can't get up.
Break my heart-Oh, all right.
Yeah, right! See, he gave up something, but then he got those magic beans. And then he woke up, and there was this, this big plant outside his window, full of possibilities and stuff.. And he lived in a village, and you live in the Village..
Oh, anyway, they say, if we want, we can see it tonight.
Ohh, I lost my mom to suicide.
Oh, the Olympics.
Yeah, and nobody slept with that Xerox girl.
Oh my god, I'm gonna be on TV!
Okay, I hear you! Are you capable of talking about any thing else?
Three months? Okay... This is probably none of my business, but uhm, how long do you think you're gonna keep seeing her?
I don't know, I don't have anyone right now. Y'know?
Uhm... Okay, well, allright, uhm... Originally I'm from upstate, but uhm... then my mom killed herself and my stepdad went to prison, so... I just moved to the city where uhm... I actually lived in a burned out Buick LeSabre for a while... which was okay, that was okay, until uhm... I got hepatitis, you know, 'cause this pimp spit in my mouth and... but I... I got over it and uhm... anyway, now I'm uhm... a freelance massage therapist, uhm... which, you know, isn't always steady money but at least I don't pay taxes, huh... So... where does everyone summer?
Oh, and great! You might as well bring me my book, it's on the counter in your apartment.
Would you relax? I know what I am doing. This is how he wears it.
Anyway, OK, now promise you won't like, freak out and say how great this is until I'm done, OK.
Ohhh, wow.
Bye!
All right, all right, we'll just do our best. Okay? So let's say I'm the interviewer and I'm meeting you for the first time. Okay. "Hi! Come on in, I'm uh, Regina Philange."
Yeah. I was just in there. He introduced himself and the next thing I know, we're making out. You know.
Yeah, well, I kinda thought.
Oh there it is.
Oh, no umm, hi, that-that, you have to put that out, 'cause I'm pregnant.
Surprise! Look who's back!
Oh, hey, y'know what? Tell them that bone story.
I know you're just moving uptown but I'm really gonna miss you.
Oh!
Yeah.
Both it is, thank you.
Yeah!
You ask us to find you a guy and you come traipsing in here with your own!
"...fuchsia and mauvvve. Those are the 66 colours of my bedroommmm." Thank you, thank you. Ohh, and I invite you to count the colours in your bedroom. Except for you. You go away.
Oh, look! Look! Look!
It will be...in a minute. Listen, Tim you're a really great guy.
We're so stupid! Do you know what's going on in there? They're trying to take Joey!
So do you want to hang out or something?
Oh, do I have a middle name. All right Monica Velula Geller. It's that bedroom there.
I guess so.
God, they thought they can mess with us! They're trying to mess with us?! They don't know that we know they know we know! Joey, you can't say anything!
All I could think of was y'know, "Is he gonna kiss me? Is he gonna kiss me?"
Okay.
Definitely not his mother.
That is so weird! I had a dream that you'd have lunch with Richard.
Yeah. 'Hello. Oh my God, I totally forgot! Well can't someone else do it. But, I have company. Yeah, no look, that's all right I'll come in.' Um, Frank, I'm really sorry but I have to go to work. It's-it's one of my regulars and he's insisting that I do 'um.
Okay. So, what are you?
Shhh! Shhhh! Joey's asleep.
Oh hey! So, how did your doctor's appointment go?
Me too. Although this city is my home, so. So that's dumb what I said, don't tell him I said that. Umm, you make something up. Nice, thank you. This is me. Here.
And... moment's over! So, ok, uh, I can forget that. I can forget that and uhm... Oh this is funny! Oh, but you need to know that to... that, to... Oh, ok, well, uhm, I . Ok, ok, I, ok, I.... MONICA I CAN'T DO IT LIKE THIS! THIS IS MY WEDDING! OKAY, I DON'T WANT THIS OR THIS OR THIS OK? I JUST WANTED A SIMPLE WEDDING! WHERE MY FIANCEE CAN GO TO THE BATHROOM ANYTIME HE WANTS! You know what? You're done.
I'm telling you! Oh, okay! This is the part of the musical where there'd be a really good convincing song. "Bam-bam, don't take no for an answer. Bam-bam, don't let love fly away. Bam-bam-bam-bam..."
Yeah, welcome.
Oh.
Okay, doctor says any minute now.
Sounds like he's with someone.
Let's just say, I'm glad I'm not Chandler.
Can't a girl finish a song around here?
Or, or the rodeo!!
Well, not much has changed in the last five minutes.
You're going to Minsk.
Hey, don't call him that! His name is Spackel Back Harry!
He just got a divorce right?
I don't accept this rule. When me make plans, I expect you to show up. Okay, I can't just be a way to kill time 'til you meet someone better! Y'know boyfriends and girlfriends come and go, but this is for life!
Me too!
And a small piece of chocolate.
All right, here it goes...
This isn't a good deed, you just wanted to get on TV! This is totally selfish.
Oh, wait, let me get you another glass. That's been sitting out.
You're not serious, right?
Oh my God!! The baby just kicked!
You know, the asthma guy was really cute.
Uh-huh.
Ok, you're gonna have to not touch my ass.
Please, I almost fell for that with, uh, Pride of the Yankees, I thought I was gonna see a film about Yankee pride and then, boom, the guy gets Lou Gehrig's disease.
Um-mmm, and I won't have to go there anymore because I gave them my correct address.
I brought you alphabet soup.
Oh my God, so do I!
Uhuh, uhuh...
Ross, thank God.
I know!
well, this is, this is, this is not over! Hello?
You wanna work on your interview skills?
I feel really strongly about this, Rachel. Please, don't use this gift certificate. I'm asking you as a friend.
Destiny.
Umm, do health inspectors work on commission?
I'd love to.
Yeah. The '92 Ross wouldn't.
Yeah, Professor and Mrs.
Ah, Catwoman. So we meet again.
Oh hey you guys, I couldn't get a reservation for the night of my birthday, so we have to do dinner Thursday night instead.
Oh! Ooh! Oh Monica! It's so beautiful.
But you were going to propose?
Yeah, no kidding, this just proves no good can come from having sex with Ross!
Hey!
You ok?
That's too hard. Too hard!
Wait a minute.
Hey!
Yeah, me either.
Oh no.
Ross, you've got to tell her how you feel!
Yeah, well, we'll see about that. Can I use your phone? I just wanna call everyone I know.
Hey!
Yeah, not in your case Lovey Loverson.
You think you know me so well.
You know it's me?
All right, wait just one more second. Hi, it's Phoebe and Rachel's. Please leave a message, thanks!
Hey!
Good morning receptionist.
Oh.
Wait-wait-wait, wait! Puppies. Cute or ugly?
Toll-booth! Four bucks. There are quarters in the glove compartment.
Okay. Okay. I-Okay umm...this...I-I sent my friend Joey in here to find out stuff about you. Umm y'know, if it helps you came off great. A lot better than I'm coming off right now.
OK, now I'm gonna kick some ass.
Okay.
Thank you, mister Bag.
Look Eric, turn around. Look, I like you, but it shouldn't be this hard. Y'know? This is our first date y'know? First dates are supposed to be about excitement and electricity and 'Ooh, he just touched my hand, did he mean to touch my hand?' and y'know first kisses and......second kisses.
Oh, I have a headache. A horrible headache!
Well hey, it's just a backup.
Are you kidding? I'm like the one who talked him into it. I like to think of myself as the puppet master of the group.
where were you standing?
Oh, there you are Ben!
It's nice that he has someone.
Ross, where did you get this?!
Oh, yeah. Aw, remember the days when you used to go out to the barn, lift up your shirt, and bend over?
I had one.
I guess.
Another amazing find! Wow! Oh I bet this has a great story too!
London is stupid! Stupid!
They're at the coffeehouse.
Wrap it up, wrap it up, wrap it up...
Oh my God.
I can't believe you caved.
Well, Frank has to quit college because his super fertile sister is having three babies! I need to make a lot of money really fast, and I had an idea that I want to talk to you about, 'cause you work for a big company. Okay, insider trading, what information is there that you can give me.
Wait! But Ross if they don't get along then you should smooth things over. Make them be friends.
Oh my God! Why would you play hide and seek with someone you know is a flight risk?!
No. Why?
They were threefold.
Fine all right, but I'd bet you'd be singing another tune if we were fighting over a ratchet.
Aren't you gonna answer her, that's like the tenth bing-bong message she sent. She wants to know what's wrong?
Oh.
Ohhh.
Ok, I'll walk you out.
Thank you so much.
Oh wait, oh I forgot... and uhm... I love you... and you have nice eyes.
I can't. I can't believe I have plans, I can't. Can you do it tomorrow night though?
Since when are you into swing music?
Hey, hey! Boo us? Boo you!
So uh, now look at the picture...
Yeah! Let's do it! Let's live together! Oh god, we're really going to move in together!
So, you're like a zillionaire?
Well okay, let this be a lesson to all of you, all right. Once you, once you betray me, I become like the ice woman, y'know. Very cold, hard, unyielding, y'know nothing, nothing can penetrate this icy exterior. Can I have a tissue, please?
And! She uses sex as a weapon!
No, not Phoebe, Dr. Philange. Oh no! You have it too!
What am I gonna do?
God. Do think it really doesn't hurt? 'Cause how can they do that?
Hi, yeah, hi! I'm umm, Phoebe Buffay, and I have babies coming out of me.
I-I mean I, well I think I can figure it out. I guess y'know I was born, and everyone started lying their asses off!
Yeah, they thought I was a whore.
Hey.
Yes! Exactly! And that's why...
The exclamation point in the title scares me. Y'know, it's not just Freud, it's Freud!
Duh, I think I know how to heat breast milk. Ok.
I decided to pee.
And Joey, get me a bottle of wine and glasses?
Oh my God!!
So, here you are. It seems like yesterday I was talking to you in that little petri dish. Everyone said labor was the hardest thing I'd ever have to do, but they were wrong this is. Oh, I had the most fun with you guys! I wish I could take you home and see you everyday. Okay, I'll settle for being your favorite Aunt. I know Alice's sister has a pool, but you lived in me. Okay, so we're cool. Yeah, we're gonna be great. Little high fives! Ahh! Ahh! Ahh! Well, if you're gonna cry.
Oh yes. Oh and, the part about how they're always like drinking from out pool of inner power, but God forbid we should take a sip.
All right, let's see, call me mrs Hannigan.
Being pregnant is tough on your tummy.
Hey, I never got to hear who you guys would pick to be your girlfriend.
Okay! Okay! I'm so glad you're here.
Oo, this is a big one. Eww! Arghhhh!!
Well I don't think it's very nice of you to park here, y'know you're blocking the entrance.
Oh, she looks just like a little doll!
500 bucks at a flea market?!
Just, you know, to see... um.
Oh! These are the ones I was looking at in the store.
I think on my shoulder.
Yeah, yeah! And you can get rid of that French poster.
This is nice. We never do anything just the two of us.
Ross, you're being ridiculous! Okay? You are cute and smart and sweet and that is much more important than three stupid divorces!
But you guys came so close.
I can't! My circuits are fried! They're fried I tell you!!
Actually I said she abandoned me to write jingles.
Can you believe how much this is gonna cost?
So, what are we gonna do? Are we just gonna go ahead and set them up with people?
Greg and Jenny?
Maybe that's because you haven't taken the time to get to know him. Let's remedy that, shall we?
Well, how about a compromise then, okay? What if it's like y'know, Chanoey?
Yeah that's true. Yeah, you love her. You always have. You have a child together. There is no right answer.
Yeah.
It's like a gift.
So! Ross doesn't really decorate his tree with floss, but you don't hear him complaining do you? God!
Hi Paul!
Uh-huh.
Hold it! N.Y.P.D! Freeze punk!
Hi!
I'm Phoebe Buffay.
And I have your name and the fact that you're a drifter, so the ball's pretty much in your court.
So Monica, what were you gonna tell us?
Umm, I'm a masseuse...by day.
This is Monica.
Well, I can't help you.
OK.
Oh before I forget, are you coming to Mike's piano bar tonight?
Yeah.
David Lynn.
Ahh, his work is done.
Ohh!! God! Ooh! Get out of here, good for nothing.
No I'm not. No! If anything I'm making you look better! They'll see you talking to me and that's--I'm a hit!
I-I-I-I-I don't know, I don't know what to say.
Ooh, y'know what, I think it's time for puppy to go out again. Come on, let's go to the balcony.
Ooh, I love that place! So, no.
Umm... Wow, all right. Wow! Yay! Ooh, I'm gonna meet a guy! And really soon! And he's gonna be the man of my dreams. Probably not the guy I had a dream about last night.
What are you gonna name the baby?
Hey!
OK, now I'm gonna kick some ass.
Oh, no wonder I don't feel full.
Ross, went to get a cab so we can all... No, wh-what are you doing! No, Monica, no!
All right, I already didn't give them back to you, that's what I said. Where is that other earring?
"Good-bye Phoebe and Ursula. I'll miss you. P.S. Your Mom lives in Montauk." You just wrote this!
Hey!
Yeah, I guess you're right.
He said that, um, he understands how sex can be like, a very emotional thing for a woman and he was just afraid that I was gonna get all, y'know, like, 'ohh, is he gonna call me the next day' and, y'know, 'where is this going' and, ya know, blah-la-la-la-la. So he said he wanted to hold off until he was prepared to be really serious.
Why?
Yeah.
See, I didn't know that.
I'm trying to get your parents to like me.
OK, OK, don't get all squinky.
Wait! Oh wait! Oh no!
Oh my God! Dizziness, nervousness, drowsiness, facial swelling, nausea, headache-Headache. Vomiting, stomach bleeding, liver damage! Now okay, I don't recall any of this coming up when you gave me these little death capsules! Oh I'm sorry, extra strength death capsules!
Oh, well, don't tell me you want to keep more of your stuff in my uterus.
Ooh, that is silly. I'll go up there, I'll tell him to keep it down.
No. But thanks.
Yep.
Besides, it might be kinda fun to form the new A-Team.
and...
Hi!
Well, I've got to get out of this bed, I'm going crazy here. Crazy!
Oh really? She said she wants to go away with you?
I really, really am sorry.
You know, the strippers, and the guys dancing, and you know, pee-pee's flying about.
I know.
What?
Hey!
Oh my God!
Ohh, ohh, Lorne Green?
Yeah! So--ooh, I gotta ask you though. How did you know where to find me?
Because you are so afraid of commitment! You talk to him, make him scared like you! Make him a...man!
Well, he's very charming.
Okay, oh and you know, if she gets upset, just scratch her tummy and give her a liver snout.
I mean, I know Joey is not my boyfriend, or my thermos, or anything, but...
I am soo dead.
Oh, can I play too? I've never played football, like ever.
I can't do that. I'm an actor. I have a process.
Uh-huh.
Monica, you call it.
Ear plugs, or cloves of garlic?
Ok, Ross, could you just open your mind like this much, ok? Wasn't there a time when the brightest minds in the world believed that the world was flat? And, up until like what, 50 years ago, you all thought the atom was the smallest thing, until you split it open, and this like, whole mess of crap came out. Now, are you telling me that you are so unbelievably arrogant that you can't admit that there's a teeny tiny possibility that you could be wrong about this?
Umm, I'm sorry. Won't-won't Jack's father be joining us?
I'm on top of the world, looking down on creation and the only explanation I can find...
I knooow.
Yeah!
Buffay is spelled B-U-F-F-A-Y.
Oh, really?
Aww, and good luck to you too! What a nice lady!
I'm talking about massages.
I've never done that.
Yeah, we-we feel kinda responsible.
Bread, so you never go hungry.
Yeah! It's not like it spits out a Clark bar after every game.
Yeah, no, I'm fairly intuitive and psychic. It's a substantial gift.
Hey, Lizzie.
But they shouldn't happen, you know what, you're, you're in a terrible, terrible business. Oh God, I don't wanna be the person who makes your face look like that.
No! Nothing with a raccoon.
So...Thank you.
I still cannot believe you're engaged! Just 'cause its happening so fast; not 'cause you're such a loser.
Oh no, ooh, ooh, did somebody forget to use a coaster?
Monica, Monica, you know what gets out hummus.
Wait a minute. What's his name?
Okay, I will. But right after you tell me who the hell you are.
Yeah!
Oh.
They've been quiet for a long time.
No! No!! It's me! It's me! I-I didn't want to make any noise!
How do you know about this?
Well, I've never had it, I feel so left out. Oh look!
Really? Even more humiliating than.
No, it did not.
Well, if that's what they do in Minsk... In New York... it's...
So?
Oh he's like a...
Please! Please! Please! Please! Oh please! Please! Please! Frank and Alice asked me to baby sit the triplets and I'm nervous 'cause I've never done that before by myself!
Wow! And hey, it's cool if you're a lesbian!
Why?
God, I hope they kick his ass!
Oh sorry, boyfriend!
Ooh, this is it, 74.
Really? It doesn't have anything coming out of it. Or maybe there is some place for her in your bedroom?
No! I am a positive person. You are like Santa Clause on Prozac, at Disneyland, getting laid!
Ok, welcome to the fu-oh.
After applying the Waxine and linen strips to leg number one,
What a sad little life she must lead. Okay, ooh .
Oh.
I can say I told you so but she's kinda doing that for me.
Well, if you must know I have written 14 books. And as I am the only one who has read them, I can tell you that they all have been very well received.
Which means she had a couple spritzers and a quick peck on the cheek.
Oh my God! Well the idea of a woman flirting with a-with a single man, we-we must alert the church elders!
Are you okay?
And Tim I just wanna say, good luck here.
Yeah.
Yeah, so... They gotta die someday. HELLO!
Ooh, if you take the northern route there's a man in Illinois with a beard of bees. {Okay, I must protest this, I've lived in Illinois all my life and know of no man with a beard of bees! Wisconsin, on the other hand, might be a different story.}
I might have.
I think that uh, yours is a question with many answers.
Hey.
I'm sorry you guys but, you know, Mike's got his brother and his friends from school so... you know, you were-you were... if it helps you, you were next in line, you just-you just missed the cut.
Forget her! You enjoy this!!
Umm, the street. Come on, let's go to the street. Ooh, listen, don't go onto the balcony until after I get back.
Love it!
Alright, I'll try, fine! Yes, Okay!
No, y'know what don't close it 'cause the... keys...are in there.
Oh! Here we all are! Yeah, there's Ross and Joey and you and me.
Oh, come on Will! Just take off your shirt and tell us!
Oh right, maybe I'll just go home.
Ta-da.
What about my children Drake?! Huh!? No!! No!! No! God!
Oh yeah, that's over.
No, Joey! You borrowed my cab; you have to drive it back.
But.
Well, I think I broke it. But that's all right, here's the number you can call.
I don't want to hear about her!!
"Oh, I have to get my number back. Oh my God. He's gone." Dead on.
Hi.
That was supposed to be a good thing, I forget why. Just listen, Monica, I, do you know, okay, do you know, I couldn't sleep for like a month because I got like a dot of ink on one of the sofa cushions.
Oh, I didn't know you wanted her too!
Oh yes. Yes. Yeah-no. She did. She left you umm, this lipstick.
That wasn't a date! That was, that was just friends getting together... having sex.
Eww! Oh, it's all dirty. You should throw this out.
Just for some short-term-work. You know, until I get back some of my massage clients.
You should be. I'm very bendy. I'm gonna kiss you now.
Okay, this is inexcusable. I am shocked to my very core!
You guys, what, what do we do about Ross who drove all the way up here? What do we do? Just like send him back and we're then gonna go skiing?
Lather, rinse, repeat, and lather, rinse, repeat, and lather, rinse, repeat, as needed.
Just don't. Look at this funky shirt!
'Cause that's just your taste.
There you go, that's the spirit! Okay! Now, if you need money, I will lend you money, but just get moving!
I'm in.
Oh, okay, except I broke up with Roger.
Oh thank you.
You guys?
Nope.
Really? So she said, she didn't wanna live with me anymore?
Uh-huh, well! But umm, still I'm-I'm mad at you.
Huh. Okay. Well, I'm really happy for you.
Joey! Wow, you didn't rip off any buttons.
Who the hell are all these people?
Uhh, I can't stop thinking about it. It's just so hard. I just wanna grab all these houses and rub 'em all over my body.
Sting's son, seven years old and there's a picture.
Hey!!
Okay. I'd- just- I'd never be able to enjoy it. It would be like this giant karmic debt.
Oh, I want to look too! . Yikes!
Well, why are you doing this anyway?
Hmmm? Yeah. So, um, is she fat?
Okay, let's talk outside.
Wow! I didn't know you guys actually used those.
Well, it seems like there weren't any tears 'til you showed her the bill.
Yes! You mean the world the world to me. Oh...
Well, I would love to but...the bike got stolen and the police have no suspects.
Oh, okay! "Would I go back to Allesandro's? Sure, but I'd have to order two meals, one for me and one for the guy pointing the gun to my head." Wow! You really laid into this place.
Sure.
Ross says hi.
What you got?
I don't know!
Ohhhh.
It's not Santa's plan. No, it's...
Okay. Okay, let's say I bought a really great pair of shoes. Do you know what I'd hear, with every step I took? 'Not-mine. Not-mine. Not-mine.' And even if I was happy, okay, and, and skipping- 'Not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not-mine'...
Got it.
Come in.
Oh, ok. How, it's been so long since you've had sex, you're wondering if they've changed it?
Yeah! Or too, you could be two stockbrokers and you're-you're-you're rolling around naked on the trading floor and everybody's watching! It never happened.
Oh, thanks a lot. Do you want to get a cup of coffee?
Platting goats are platting. Platting down the street. Platting goats are platting, leaving little treats. Does it even work without my sexy voice?
All right. . He is a good guy. You're right, he wouldn't cheat.
I've already stuffed a bunch of Brussel sprouts down his pants.
Okay.
You wish.
Oh God!
Yes.
Ameri-can. Y'know it's a very hard language. Let's do it again.
Oh, whew, no, that's Bob.
I don't know. I-I think it's still gonna be a while.
Open bar!
Yes, but I'm doing this.
So, you just let her go?
Oh. Okay, well I-I was kinda hoping that I would just...be alone y'know to think about my mom and her suicide.
Shocking!
Okay, fine! Fine! Mmm...hmmmmm....
I started that!
Which is why my answer is yes!
Oh.
So... and?
Can you believe this? We were waiting for a hot guy and then an even hotter one shows up!
Yes, and now he's using this three divorces reason because he wants to stay married to her because he loves her. I must say, "Well done!" Bravo Meg.
Wow.
No, that would be, "Why are you being cute?"
Frank Jr.Jr.?
What's that smell?
OK, that's my tattoo.
Ugh, what a kiss ass.
I think it's just y'know that I haven't been with a guy in so long and how sometimes you're looking for something and you just don't even see that it's right there in front of you sipping coffee-Oh no, have I said to much? Well it's just something to think about. I know I will.
Yeah. What-what are you doing here?
Oh my God!
I'll run out and get you one.
No, okay, you're right. You're easy-going. You're just not as easy-going as Rachel. She's just more flexible and-and mellow. That's all.
All right, everyone calm down! Everyone calm down! I have something that I would like to say! Who here likes Ross? Of course you don't like him! He-he didn't give you any money, he raised his own hand when I asked, "Who hear likes Ross," and he's wearing two nametags! I-I'll be honest with you guys, when I first met Ross I didn't like him at all! But then once I got to know him I saw that he's really sweet and caring and very generous. I mean, all I'm saying is don't judge Ross before you get to know him all right? I mean, I like all you guys now, but when I first meet you y'know Kurt, I thought, y'know abrasive drunk, umm Lola, mind numbingly stupid! And okay, you guys Gold-digger, cradle robbing perv! So, I think you all know what I mean.
I can't believe this!
I did not see that coming.
So how are things going with Paul?
Oh, it's so hard to get rid of stuff! Did you and Chandler have to make compromises when you first moved in together?
What are you doing?!! Why are you defending him?! Just get me another doctor! One who is not crazy and who is not Fonzie!
Sure! Look, ok, bottom line: I love Mike... David! David. I love David. Don't look at me that way, Roseanne Rosannadanna!
But are you saying that you would move out if I didn't buy that lamp?
Come on you guys, let's just do our own Thanksgiving.
Rifts. Yeah, I know.
Yeah, but you shouldn't compare yourself to me.
Of course, yeah!
There isn't time. You must leave everything. They'll take care of you next door.
Hey Joey.
Any luck?
Well, I mean, then what happens if it doesn't work out?
Hey!
She's got her cell, you could call her.
Awe, this is so sweet of you! But you know what? I won't be needing a veil, I actually won't be wearing a dress at all!
Ross, Rachel doesn't know that you wanna get back together. If she did, she might feel differently. She might not even go.
Okay umm, well, first Chandler and Monica will get married and be filthy rich by the way. Yeah. But it won't work out.
Why not!
So, now, Rach, this is a traditional English trifle, isn't it?
Uh, only if you have the hiccups too. Yeah, the pictures are for you, the water and the chocolate is for me. I just didn't feel like getting up. Okay, I'm gonna show you a picture of Ross. Okay? And you're going to remember all of the bad things about him. All right? Really focus on his flaws.
Yeah but why didn't you just say that you didn't read the book?!
Ooh, is that spelled with a 'C' or a 'K'? Oh my God! It doesn't matter; they're both great!
Ugh, PBS!
All right, what's going on there?
Well, I'm ready to get the hell out of here! Oh. Are you? Are you?!! Ohh! That's so great!! Ooh, not for Bonnie. But for you, yay! Ohh.
Wow, Carol really messed you up!
Yay, I rock.
Well this doesn't even smell like opium.
My medallion number is, "Get out of the cab!"
Oh I just miss him so much!
Yeah, Chandler why don't you take a walk? This doesn't concern you.
Umm, I'm trying to move that pencil.
Hi!
Cigarettes?!!
You gonna tell her?
Okay, first of all, breathe. Second of all, I don't get it. Aren't you the one that decided that you didn't want to be with Ross?
All right, I have ya. Oh God.
Really? That hadn't occurred to me.
Okay.
Well, why don't you just get him fired?
Hey. We found her, we found the girl.
There's no dog in here.
Well, if you're leaving, I'm definitely gonna go.
Well, what kind of guy are you looking for?
I just can't decide who she looks more alike, you or Rachel?
So was it a lot more money?
Hey!
Wow! Nice! Manly and also kind of a slut.
Y'know what, you should like, you should buy a state and then just name it after yourself.
Well actually you're the one person I can't tell this too. And the one person I want to the most.
One hundred thousand dollars!
Oh, I can't believe you guys lasted a whole year!
No it isn't, this is my dad, alright, I'll show you.
Alright. I looked all over the building and I couldn't find the kitty anywhere.
But...
Maybe because you never listen to anything that I say. I talk about her all the time! DENISE!!!!!
Okay.
Yeah, I know, Frank. I counted them when they were coming out of my area.
I don't use a curling iron.
Unless! Unless umm, okay I-I would be willing to go to the concert, umm, all the while thinking about the children of course.
No! Because he's in love with the British chippy! Look, Rachel, if you go, you're just gonna mess with his head and ruin his wedding! Y'know, it's too late! You missed you're chance! I'm sorry, I know this must be really hard, it's over.
Yeah. I really hate to give her up. Oh, I know!! Oh, you should take her!
Because, every time I go to the dentist, somebody dies.
Yeah, I'll do that. So who gets to be yours?
Oh I know, I've been there. I remember toward the end...
Good idea!
Yeah, uh-huh, there was nothing. Can I get some water?
Ohh, uh-huh so much!
That is brand new information!!
That's fair! Thank you so much. Thanks. Oops, it looks like when he got the pastry chef he got you a little bit too.
Okay.
Yeah, so do you.
Oh.
That is.
Oh, okay... good. You do that. And then when you get home, maybe there'll be a special delivery package waiting for you.
I love the second grade!
Okay, okay, okay, okay... Still sure about me being myself?
Ugh! Women!
Hey.
Thank you.
Oh my god! Shouldn't we stop this?
Oh, I don't make them a lot because I don't think it's fair to the other cookies
Is it okay if I leave this stuff here 'til Rachel's birthday party?
Fauna.
But, your Rachel wasn't whiny enough.
How was your night?
What? He's gonna be dressed as a baby! Oh hi Mrs. Green!
Separate performances.
Yay!! Oh so, you're not, you're not mad at us anymore?
Okay, I can fix this! Okay Monica, Rachel thinks all you can talk about is the wedding.
No, no, Mr. Heckles no one is making any noise up here.
Ooh! We have a problem.
Good, but wait. Okay, all right, here we go. Now I want you to relax. Take a deep breath. Clear your mind. Which do you like better peanut butter or egg whites?
I don't believe you! That is...brilliant! And Monica has no idea?
Oh, what was that for? Like a bake sale?
Listen. Listen. Smelly cat, smelly cat, what are they feeding you?
Would you stop already? Get out of the bitter barn and play in the hay.
Ha-ha, that's great, ha-ha. I can't wait to hear the rest of it, ya know, but I really have to go to the bathroom so... Hey, come with me. Yeah, yeah, it'll be like we're gal pals, ya know, like at a restraunt. Oh, it'll be fun, c'mon.
I know.
Oh my God, she's so stupid!
What's that?
So.
Now you know how you really feel about it.
Yeah, I've discovered that Ross forgot to take his brain medicine, uh, now without it, uh, in the brain of Ross, uh women's names are interchangeable, through-through no fault of his own.
You heard her too?! You have the gift!
But on the southern route there's a chicken that plays tic-tac-toe.
She was a drug dealer!
Wow! Oh well, I will be there!
Okay, who's next?
Well, you promised me a fun road trip! We've been on the road six hours and you've been asleep for five and a half! We are switching at the next rest stop and you are going to drive all the way back! That will be your punishment, you greedy sleeper!
Ahh, toilet seat covers! Is that what you were doing while I was getting gas?
Uh-huh, what?
Oh, god, the last time I babysat them, they did the funniest thing..
Sure.
Yeah.
But great news about the apartment pants, huh?
Great, okay, what are you gonna change it to?
Okay.
My sticky shoes, my sticky-sticky shoes, why do you stick on me, ba-a-by! Thanks for the lights honey.
Oh well, as long as it is under control, you know, you can't do anything about it, he's already dating her, and she is a nice person, that wouldn't be right.
Hi! Oh yeah, uh-huh, it's me. I saw you grab your running shoes this morning and sneak out. You lied so you could run by yourself.
Uh-huh.
Oh good, ok. Oh nooo, I have to go because I'm late for my um, Green Eggs and Ham discussion group. Um tonight it's why he would not eat them on a train. Have fun bye.
oh, oh, oh! This is so great! Oh my god! This was not at all scary. Hi everybody. Hi Betty! Betty, Hi! You found Betty! Oh my god! This is great. Everybody I love is in the same room, Where's Joey?
So, what? Monica, we have the winning ticket! My psychic said I was gonna win, remember?
Oh, thats good.
I miss you too!!!!
Oh no. No-no-no, don't do that! How could I live with myself if I knew I was depriving the world of your music.
What's going on?
Oh! What what what! ...Hi.
Okay. We are at a rest stop on Route 27. Okay. There is no Route 27. Okay, either 93 or 76?
Are you calling me selfish?!
Ross! How could you do that to an old man?!
Oh good! Okay. 'Cause you were acting like you didn't.
Oh yeah, like you never called!
Maybe your resolution is to not make fun of your friends, especially the ones who may soon be flying you to Europe for free on their own plane.
That's all right, I'll work here. This is goo, next to this plant.
Yeah! Here! Oh no, these are the trick deck. Okay. Here yes. Okay.
Umm listen, I don't think...I don't think I'm gonna make it to the wedding. So I just want to wish you all the luck in the world.
Oh, you guys! We've got to keep all the tickets together.
Oh, COOL!! Wow, it's like a time capsule!
Yeah, I wanted to call and tell you that there's no hard feelings for firing me.
Y'know what, but there is, there is no right or wrong, here.
Well, Ursula is a waitress and-and she lives in Soho. And Phoebe, is on this couch.
We want you to marry her!
Well, she really wanted to talk to you now.
Na-uh, no, we are all responsible for our own babies.
Get your foot off my contestant! Judge!
Yes, yes! Like the man in the shoe!
Did he go out for a cigarette?
I'D Better Go. Just Over Here I don't want to miss the fight.
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
Really, can I hear some of it.
'Cause it's good money! But that doesn't change the fact that this is an evil blood sucking corporate machine!
Yes, they are expected presently. Yeah, yeah um, their arrival is in the offing.
That's a dog, every house should have a dog.
Oh, I don't wanna choose! It's . Oh okay, wait. Rach! Listen I have a very special bridesmaid task for you today.
Good! Great! You can go first.
Are you ah, Phoebe Abott?
I guess I dropped the ball there. Whoopsie!
Alright, I can get you out.
All right, it seems pretty simple. Your first line is "My name is Claude", so, just repeat after me. "Je m'appelle Claude".
Rachel, what the hell is this?!
Say what?
There you go.
So what are they doing?
Hi Joey.
Thank you! God, no! You should see me when... Oh actually, no, I look pretty good.
Monica.
He shot a bird!
The end.
What?
Oh, okay, you're not a pushover.
This stuff is great!
Well, it was an accident...You know, it's a lot of oil and sometimes the hand just slips! Chandler: Have I got a surprise for you? Pack your bags!
Everybody looks so happy. I hate that.
Oh, I know! "Oh...I slept with Billy Joel". All right, who hasn't?
See? I'm doing it. I am totally doing it. I lost it.
You guys!
Okay.
No.
See there it is right there.
Alright, what are we gonna say?
Yep, we shook on it. Yeah but believe me that is not how he wanted to seal the deal.
Oh! Suddenly somebody knows all about the side affects!
No, not Phoebe, Dr. Philange. Oh no! You have it too!
Okay.
Okay, remember that little problem I was having during my fourth month of pregnancy?
I love you too...
Yeah, I know, but I don't think that means anything.
This is fashion?! Okay, so to you, death is fashion?! That's really funny. Here's Phoebe umm, sporting uh, y'know, cutting edge hairy carcass from y'know, the steal traps of wintry Russia. I mean, you really thing this looks good? 'Cause I do.
Oh, because, you know... they don't like you.
Wow, so glad I changed. Almost wore my ??? outfit that can't contain my breasts.
It kicked! I think the baby kicked!
Ok. Do we have to talk like that then they're not around? Oh, no, no! Listen, is there someone who can fill in for me?
You know, I might know somebody. Hey, how about you set me up with someone, and we double date!
Really? Lee Majors is hot!
Yeah! You bet roomy!
Don't feel too sorry for me. At least my boyfriend isn't gay.
I'm sorry.
Why? The only person my playing is bothering is you!
But what about all the "finding-his-flaws" stuff we've been doing?
Wow, you guys go way back then. So what are you up to these days?
What?
Hey the wedding is so close! Are you getting nervous?
I won! I won! I finally won!
Thanks.
Ohh! So you're 5639?!
It's too soon to tell. She's resting, which is a good sign.
Come on, take 'em off!!
Monica! We lived together for years! I've seen you naked!
You won awards?
Thanks you guys! Thank you.
You told me you hate massages!
Intense and creepy.
Well, our plan is working. Rachel is having a miserable time, and Ross is just stood up somewhere at a restaurant all alone.
Yeah!
Okay whatever.
But again, Simmons. Go on.
I know.
- and there's five hundred extra dollars in my account.
Listen to you two. It's so sad. Looks like I'm gonna be going to the goddess meetings alone.
You smoked!
You ate meat! You had sex!
Oh my god.
About what?
You're so much more than just brains! You're sweet, and kind, and funny...
Yeah me too.
We just have to really, really, really, not let stuff like money get--is that a hickey?
Y'know she has a face Ross!
Well, so what I like him! Do I make fun of the people you've dated? Tag, Janice, Mona? No, because friends don't do that. But, do you want my opinion? Do you want it? 'Cause in my opinion, your collective dating record reads like the who's who of human crap.
Ooh.
Fired! Why?
Oh right, ok um. Ok so its not just the lie you tell. but its the way you tell it. . For example if you look down at the ground when you're talking, people know you're lying.
That is nice and we're done. TADA!
Yeah, I talked to my grandma about the Old Yeller incident, and she told me that my mom used to not show us the ends of sad movies to shield us from the pain and sadness. You know, before she killed herself.
I'm curious about the human body.
He's not backing down. He went to get lotion.
Ok well give her a chance to see all of that!
Rachel?
Ah-ha! Too cocky!
Oh I know.
She wasn't a hooker.
Ross, could we please, please, please listen to anything else?
Oh, so they owe me like, three Phoebes.
Hi liar!
These old things.
Okay?
No, that wouldn't kill her. Ordinary embolism might.
I can't believe you're gonna ask Monica to marry you!
So how's the piano playing going?
Don't feel bad. You know they used to like you a lot. But then you got promoted, and, you know, now you're like "Mr. Boss Man". You know, Mr. Bing. Mr. Bing, "Boss Man Bing".
No, actually I don't eat...
Uh uh.
Guys, the drawing is about to start!
Oh look! That guy's peeing!
No. No! It's just y'know first, I wanna take off all my clothes and have you rub lotion on me.
Well no, it was my fault so you should get the nice room.
Ugh, okay Sherlock!
Hello?
Oh, I see.
Why?
Look, I don't wanna talk about it. Okay?
No, you can't go. No-no-no, I can't hold this table on my own. If they ask me to move, I cave.
In my day, divorce was not an option.
OK. Smelly cat, smell-ly cat, what are they feeding you? Smelly cat Oh woah, oh my God. I mean like, who was that?
Oh. It's just so unexpected! I...I uh...Boy I'll tell you it's just such an honor to be nominated for a Nobel Prize and y'know to win one for a massage. Especially after having just won a Tony award for best actress in...
Wow! Five-month maternity leave, you're back for four days, kiss a co-worker, call in sick, they are lucky to have you!!
Oh hi Ben-No!! Don't look at the machine!
Oh my God! I love things. What happened?
Hey, Joey! Hey! Ooh! Ooh! I just say someone on the-that looks just like you on the subway. And I was gonna go over and say 'hi!' but then I figured, he doesn't care if he looks like you.
No, not a thing.
Wait! Wait! Hi! Listen, Ross can I just talk to you for just a second?
Well, all right. 1700 bags of peanuts flying that high, that's pretty amazing too.
Oh, okay.
Definitely!
Really? That's the thing I'm worse at! You'll see.
Oh that's right!
I'm, I'm freaking out! Monica kinda trusted me with something and she shouldn't have! All right, I haven't lived here in a while, so I have to ask you something. Does Monica still turn on the lights in her bedroom?
OK, um, I'm gonna play, um, some songs about grandparents, OK. Now, grandma's a person who everyone likes, she bought you a train and a bright, shiny bike. But lately she hasn't been coming to dinner, And last time you saw her she looked so much thinner. Now, your mom and your dad said she moved to Peru, but the truth is she died and some day you will too. La-la-la la la-la-la la la-la-la la...
Ok, this is not about the MONEY, ok? It's about... it's about corporate greed destroying our hearts and leaving us... the hollow shells.
That's so great! 'Cause you already know how to do that!
Oh, this is so nice. Alright I have to make a speech. I just wanna say that of all the guys that Monica has been with, and that is a lot, I like you the best.
Thank you, Monica.
Please don't leave me, I'll be lonely.
yeah I've nothing to be ashamed of ok so I haven't been in a relationship that lasted longer then a month. Ok I haven't had a real boyfriend you know if he can't handle that he can leave. which he will and that's ok. so I'll just be alone forever you know alright I'll be. it'll be fine. it'll be fine. I'll go walking tours with widows and lesbians. Oh.
Hey cool, mine too.
You guys, I'm sorry, could you please talk a little slower?
Okay. Good-bye, little monkey guy. Alright, I wrote you this poem. Okay, but don't eat it 'till you get on the plane.
Well, so do a lot of people.
Hey.
Oh, okay. Excuse me sir? Could you come with me please? You have a phone call.
Sure, yeah!
So why don't ya show us the rest of your casa?
Oh no. Did umm, did she say why?
A little. Now you're talking.
Okay, stop! Larry, okay, can't you just be Larry and not Larry the health inspector guy? Y'know I mean it was really exciting at first but now it's like, okay, so where are we gonna eat ever?
Um, um, Rachel can we talk for a sec?
Y'know what Joey left on my pillow?
You guys. You suck too.
Wow, eight hour flight with a one-year old? Good luck, mom.
Well, alright, that's fine. What about Leslie?
Ooh, babies! Oh, this one is so cute, get this one!
Atlantic City, baby! Let's roll some bones! Hey Joey, high-five for rolling bones!
Whoa, what kind of party was this?
No.
Mike and I broke up.
So weird, you think he's so gross and you're willing to eat his crackers.
Why don't you play with your roommate?
Hey!
Ooh! I know what you could make! I know! Oh, you should definitely make that thing... you know, with the stuff? You know, that thing... with the stuff...? OK, I don't know.
No, no, because, you know, he's been in Minsk for 8 years and if he gets too much direct sunlight, he'll die.
That's fine, just don't bring it in my mouth.
What?
Oh no, Ross doesn't know anything.
Well I hope you have fun tonight.
Oh, not anymore. I changed it today.
Hey.
Holy mother of God!!!
That is correct! Yes, you're supposed to take all of that stuff and put it in a little box in your mind and then lock it up tight.
Hmm, something bad to tell Rachel... Bad news for Rachel, what could that be?!
So go fix it! Go find Chandler! He's probably up in your room! Tell him that you're sorry and that you love him.
Okay. Oh no-no-no, you don't touch the guitar! First you learn here, then you learn here.
Yeah, no, it was great.
Thanks you guys! Again.
Damn, that window is clean.
Right. And with who again?
Oh. Oh! Ma'am? Excuse me, ma'am?
Really?
He seems to hate you. Are you sure?
Hey.
Ok, I just wanna be really sure this time. Andie McDowell's the girl from Four Weddings and a Funeral, right?
Don't try to call him or anything, 'cause he's not there, he's out. His umm, his partner just died.
Yeah, this is the guy I was telling you about.
Isn't he good?
Oh my God! Oh my God!
No, I mean, I mean, when you're at the fifteenth date, y'know, you're already in a very relationshippy place. Y'know, it's... you're committed.
They're not even touching the lasagna!
I'm out of here.
Oh, thank you. I hope... I hope you know how much you mean to me.
Excuse me. Excuse me! Thanks. Um, clearly this is a very, very hard time for you. Um, but, um, we provided a service, and we deserve to be paid because you ate that service, and, um, we are not leaving here until we're paid every penny. 'Cause you know what, lady? We're part time caterers, and we have no place else to go.
Shut it down.
Hello grandma, if that is in fact your real name.
'Annie! Hi. Listen we got a problem with Joey Tribbiani, apparently he missed his audition. Who did you speak to in my office? Estelle, no, I don't know what I'm going to do with her. No. All right, so your husband leaves and burns down the apartment, the world does not stop.'
Ah, yeah, he's so adorable, God, he's just so much fun, Joey is the best, I'm glad you're having so much fun here.
Here.
Y'know it's funny, you'd think I'd be angry. I mean, you'd think I'd wanna rip his tiny little head off. Fortunately, I'm past it.
If you could do that, I'd marry the hippity-hop.
Yeah, I locked him years ago!
Speech! Speech! Let's hear from the birthday girl! Huh?
Hey!
Why?
You mean the chocolate chip cookie recipe?
Joey? What's going on?
You know, if you want, I'll do it with you.
Okay.
She is lying! And I bet I can prove it. Excuse me. Okay. Okay. Yeah-Not a prayer chain, but what looks like a detailed drawing of a bank floor plan. Okay, here's the nametag from the restaurant where she works as a waitress! Not a teacher, a waitress. All right, here's her driver license, this oughta be good, she always lies about this. How old did she say she was?
She died.
Doy! Probably right before she lost it!
Why are you being weird?
Y'know, just some good faith money to hold the date.
He-he does not like it! He hates it! He's in pain!
Yeah, you are. And I'm so glad that you fought your way back in, because I don't know what I would do without you.
Does a dog's lips move when he reads? Okay, no they don't.
Wow, cute one!
Oh, I couldn't go in.
Well, Susan, I see what appears to be a dark vent. Wait. Yes, it is in fact a dark vent.
Ahhh!! Chandler and Monica!! Chandler and Monica!!
Not especially. But you know what, I think they had pot in them.
No Chandler, they can swallow one of those little parts! And also, look at his smooth area, that's just gonna mess them up.
No-no!! No!!
Yeah, but only a genius would swallow a sonic blaster gun.
Shhhhhh! I'm swamped right now.
Yeah, I'm out.
Oh yeah. That's me.
Yeah, but they didn't ask me! Y'know? This way I'm just y'know, the exotic, generous stranger. That's always fun to be.
Well, I thought you loved her when you-when you married her.
So, did you pick one yet?
It's mostly just photographs of lesbian love scenes interspersed with video games and free sandwiches.
SARAH!
Well yeah, that and Chandler's problem.
Ewwww!!
Oh, look! And we get these free t-shirts!
I think you do.
Joey! Wow, you didn't rip off any buttons.
Nooo! Why would you think that?
Oh, ok. I see what you're doing, that's fine. This is all there is, just tea, uh, ok. Hmmmm... raunchy!
Oh, poor little Tooty is scared to death. We should find his owner.
How do you even know a woman like that?
I don't have it!
Okay, so what do you guys really think of Chandler?
Oh, okay, umm, hi kids! Um, it's me, Aunt Phoebe. I can't wait to see you. Please don't hurt me!
Aw, honey it's not your fault, y'know this is who you are, and I love you, and I want us to be friends, and if I keep living here I don't see that happening.
Monica had lunch with Richard.
I found it!
Excuse me! Can you tell me where I can find Earl? He's the supply manager around here.
Shh, wait and see. Maybe we will, maybe we won't.
Why?! What's happening to the coffee house?! Oh!
Thank God.
I know, I know. So sweet... and so complicated. And for a shrink, he's not too shrinky, y'know?
I'll get it, okay. Hi, Monica and Rachel's. Yeah, just a second, can I ask who's calling. Oh, ew, it's Michelle! Ew! She, she must have that Caller Id thing. You should get that.
I can't!!
So did you sleep well last night?
Well, it does.

It's so obvious, why doesn't he just ask?
Oh, look at that.
Okay, I'm ready.
Because a promise between friends means never having to give a reason.
Hey!
Now, it's you little bunny friend.
No, no, no! Don't call her! You wait for her to call you.
I'm sorry, did you say all man or old man?
You think he's emotionally unavailable?
Yeah and yeah, and it would probably be better than the last telephone job I had. Y'know, I probably wouldn't have to say spank as much.
Okay, don't panic. I'm gonna go to the store, I'm gonna get you another set of nails, no one's gonna know, and you're gonna look great. Oh! Oh, it's 'cause they're gonna eat-that's the problem.
Hey!
Okay, well if I was in this for the money, I'd be a millionaire by now, y'know. You just got to get out of that jingle head sweetie.
It's amazing! My headache is completely gone! What are those pills called?
Eight dollars and 27 cents. But not really, 'cause I put in the first two, just to, you know, get the ball rolling, and to make myself feel better.
So umm, now do you have any of Matt Lauer's clothes here? Maybe? Just ones that haven't been cleaned yet?
I - I don't take passengers.
Like crop circles, or the Bermuda triangle, or evolution?
Look everybody, look at my new dollhouse!!
Would you say your pesto is the best-o?
What?!
You don't have to lie anymore, Ross, I know that it was a fourteen year-old girl.
What were you doing?
I think David would probably wanna hear a few lectures.
You're welcome!
Or we could just follow your clever jokes &#150; any ideas? No! Didn't think so! Okay, c'mon guys, show us where the presents are!
Ah! Oh my God! You r-r-rotten boys!
Oh, yeah. Could be Rachel asking if someone could baby-sit again.
Oh, I'm sorry, the oven mitts really freaked me out.
Oh! Yeah!
Hey.
Ready... GO!
So okay what? You're gonna be married to a girl who doesn't even know about it?!-Op, woman! Sorry.
Ok, you guys, I don't mean to make things worse, but umm, I don't want to live with Rachel anymore.
I'm going to let him.
Will it? Will it?! I mean, how would you feel if you found out you were 31?
Ok. Quick. We gotta find a cab and follow them.
Oh. Oooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! My butt cheek is waking up! Oooh! Ooh!
Uh-huh.
But he didn't really know, you know. He wasn't planning on coming to Barbados and proposing to me...
I really do, yeah.
Really? That's so sweet. I mean, I'm officially offended but, sweet.
Uh, hello, this is Ross Geller's personal physician, Dr. Philange.
Mike? Okay! What's his last name?
Well, that's not something a girl wants to hear.
Eh, Monica it, it feels so weird, y'know, Chandler's your friend... Oh! Oh my God! Aw, all right take this bed, you can make other friends.
Oh that's not so bad.
Hi Monica!
No, no, no, we're not having a big reception, we took the money we were gonna spend on a wedding and we donate them to the children charity.
Have umm, have you thought anymore about you and Rachel?
You got me.
Ohh, that's too bad!
Oh!
Get your foot off my contestant! Judge!
I've never driven it! Okay? Not once! Okay once. Okay, I drive it all the time.
Dead. Oh, it's OK, no, he was old, yeah! And he lived a full life, he was in the first wave at Omaha Beach.
Why, why, why didn't you just say no!
Bye Chandler! I miss you already.
Oh. Aw, forget it.
Yeah I mean if you want to say anything to her, I'd tell her off.
What about this?
No, don't look directly at them!
Hey, thank you so much for these tickets, Chandler.
Oh yeah, oh and I know, but this isn't what it looks like, 'cause Rick is my ahh, husband.
'Kay.
Fine! I'll call Zurich and move some money around.
Why are you guys so upset? It's Old Yeller, it's a happy movie.
Hey! Hey, did you get your invitation to Ross's wedding?
Oh honey no, you ate it all.
Just wanna check my horoscope, see if it was right.
For what it's worth, we would have caught her if we were at the right airport.
Well maybe he was just nervous, y'know you can be very intimidating. And besides I've met your pastry chef and she can stand to be taken down a peg or two.
Bus?
For 99 cents, I'd eat you. Okay, I can totally settle down here. It's got everything I could ever want, including Joey! Look! Oh! Look! Hi!
Of course we can. Congratulations. Yay! Joey...
What?!
Oh thank God.
Oh no!
No, whad'ya mean? He's not British.
Yeah?
No! You don't have to do anything! Just don't tell them that we know!
Why? Why would you do that?
Let's just play, ok. Good, ok. Here we go, double sixes, here we go... Here we go, come to mama, just getting ready to roll the dice...
Hey Joey, y'know what? You are way to good for her.
Rossss can!
Hey oh, Rach wait! Do you want to go to a movie tonight?
Yes, when I first met you, you were like, "Blah, blah, blah." I was like, shhh!
Oh my God, you're right! I am too late; they're sitting on the couch and talking! Come on! Rachel?
I don't know, it would totally depend on her coloring and... You got the job!!
Yeah I know. Isn't it great? One less person we have to make small talk with.
Thanks! So are you.
Am I crazy or does this totally go?!
All right, all right... I'll play if we don't keep score!
Your nails.
Look, I can't have a wedding with this money now. It's tainted.
Unless... Maybe it's too crazy about this... Alright so... you know, there is no future... but that doesn't mean we still can't have fun. You know what? Forget what I said.
Oh wait a second you guys...for the last couple weeks I've been that guy everywhere I go. We take the same bus. We go to the same bookstore, the same dry cleaners; maybe he's the tea guy.
Ooh, ooh! Why don't we invite her?
Hey! Oh, how did baby shopping go?
Not if nothing happens. Why can't... why can't we just hang out as friends?
Okay, bye!
Oh, thanks!
Yeah... Ogh... Okay, fine. You made your point. Can you please just be Mike Hannigan again?
To see if know what these guys are talking about.
Oh, well get in line missy. So, can I have a ride stud?
You know, you are talking about one of my dear, dear friends.
Go ahead.
Hey, are Ross and Rachel back?
This used to be your room? Wow! You must've been in really good shape as a kid.
Hey!
No, that was my way of telling you. Well, it turns out he's incredibly sensitive, he keeps a journal and he paints. He even showed me charcoal drawings that he drew of me.
Uh, I don't think so!
She is so amazing! You have no idea.
Didn't you two already talk?
Or not, whatever.
No-no, it'll be fun! We can come back and we can haunt these guys!
Yes.
Don't be worried about that! Your tombstone can say whatever you want it to say! It could say, Ross Geller, Good at Marriage! Y'know? Mine's gonna say Phoebe Buffay, Buried Alive.
Oh! Ok, um, ok, um,
Dive. Yeah, they dove head-first into fun on the farm.
Yeah, I kinda do. Well, how's this?
Help me.
Okay, I'm hearing.
Really?!
Hey! Ross!
Okay, don't worry, I'm just checking to see if the muscle's in spasm...huh.
Thank you. No? All right. Oh, it's so nice to see you.
Bye.
Yeah, um, which ones in particular were great for you?
So tell me about this girl?
Alex Trebek?
Wait! What?! No!! Elevator!! No!
Just get your nails done?
Oh, yeah, sure. I just hope you, hope you don't accidentally suck it up through your nose and choke on it.
Oh, it's okay, it was just my left leg.
Well, maybe we will. Oh!
Well, I'm not proud of it, but, you know... sometimes when I was living on the street and I needed money for food and stuff I.
Yeah, yeah, no, I don't, I don't know. But, y'know what, maybe it's just all for the best?
"Went to the store, sat on Santa's lap./Asked him to bring my friends all kind of crap./Said all you need is to write them a song./They haven't heard it, so don't try and sing along./No, don't sing along./Monica, Moncia, have a happy Chanukah./Saw Santa Clause, he said hello to Ross./And plese tell Joey, Christmas will be snowy!/And Rachel and Chandler, have err-umm-glander!!"/Happy holidays, everybody!
Hey! Do you want do you want a little taste of Pheebs?!
No, huh uh, I'm sorry, no. No, I'm not some like sloppy second, charity band. You know what, there are thousands of places in this city where people would be happy to pay to hear me play. When I play, I play for me, I don't need your charity. Thank you! La la la la la la la....
OK, who is the boss of you?!!
m'ap.
To Ross.
What when Yeller saves saves the family from the wolf and everyone's happy?
Y'know, you're friend's getting married, it's gotta change things.
Oh no no.
Oh.
She is gonna hate me.
No!! No way! No! And stop using my name! And shame on you! And shame on all of you! You're disgusting! Especially you with that!
Well, I've been reading up and for your information, minks are not very nice. Okay, I admit it! I love this coat! Okay, I-it's the best thing I've ever had wrapped around me, including Phil Huntley! Remember Phil Huntley? He was fine!
Ooh, you nailed the Old Lady!
Yeah, I-I can't-I mean y'know I was trying to be really y'know okay and upbeat about it, I just-I feel so dwarfed by your musical gift. I...
Why would you leave your Belgian waffle in the hall?
No. You are the boss of you. Now you march your heinie in there and get that heart tattooed on your hip. GO!!
Hey Joey, want come with me to... are you ok?
No I just, just wanted to know who he was, ya know.
'Cause he was creepy, and mean, and a little frightening... alright, still, it's nice to have a date on Valentine's Day!
Oh, he's at the doctor, he didn't poop the whole time we were there!
Well... It's a date.
Umm, look we don't, we don't really know each other so it would be really easy to just forget about this, but there seems to be something between us. And I don't know about you but that doesn't happen to me a lot.
Fine! You go learn from your qualified instructor! But don't come crying to me when everyone's sick and tired of hearing you play Bad, Bad Leroy Brown!!
Now OK, I haven't seen it yet so, if you don't like it, well, so what, none of you ever made a video. OK.
Oh yeah!
I can hop.
Okay. Rachel, the hottest babies in the Tri-State Area are in this room right now! I overheard one of the judges say that not one of them holds a candle to Emma!
Wherere you going?
Oh yeah!
Oh no.
Hey!
Yeah, okay, I've-I've been dating both of you, and it's been really horrible. 'Cause y'know it's been a lot of fun, for me. Umm, but I-I like you both, and I, and I didn't know how to chose, so... I'm sorry, I'm just, I'm terrible, I'm a terrible person. I'm terrible.
I can't believe you did this.
Okay. No. But thanks.
Oh! Oh! Oh! Okay, fine, fine. Now I don't feel so bad about sleeping with Jason Hurley.
Why not?!
Okay, I have a wedgie.
How about we talk about this over dinner?
I don't know, I hardly ever say that about people.
Speaking of Christmas, umm since Monica and I are starting a new business and have like no money, umm, this year maybe we could do secret Santa, and then we each only buy one gift. And-and there's the added mystery of who gets who.
I feel like my face is swelling. Is my face swelling?
Five minutes ago, a line like that would've floored me. Now nothing. Well, not nothing, I am still a woman.
Bye, good luck.
Ewww!!!
Yes.
Okay.
What about, what about when I said y'know about the apartment pants, how dumb was I?
I know no, no, y'know you don't deserve this, you don't Ross. You're, you're really, you're so good.
Wow, that sounds great! And what are you making Monica, in case Rachel's dessert is... so good that I eat all of it. There's none left for anybody else!
What? Can't you see I'm in the middle of something? Ooh, I like it.
No. wh - get off your sister! Oh my god, what are we gonna do? We have 7 rats. So what if each of them has 7 rats? And then each of those have 7 rats? That's like ... That's math I can't even do! What are we gonna do?
Well, nobody wants a ghost. But you've got one, because the house is sitting on an ancient Indian burial ground.
Rachel said that!
Oh.
Ooh, technically you owe me $600 for sending out happy thoughts on your last ten auditions.
Yeah. Candy's the mother, Cookie's the daughter. The father's also Cookie. Why am I friends with these people?
OK, is this really my father?
Yeah, yeah, no it's OK 'cause, I mean, I know he's there, so, that's enough for now.
Wait!
Well, maybe he wouldn't be she didn't bring the office home every night!
I do, I believe you.
You gotta go!
Who? Who is it?
Why not?
Ooh, Atlantic City! Oh, that's a great plan! Who's plan was that?
Yeah, by Sandrine.
Okay, I didn't hear that.
I didn't see this on the menu.
You wanna do it right now?
I know, I know, we can drive, we can vote, we can work, what more do these broads want?
Really? So this is... this is my big send off in the married life? Rachel this is the only bachelorette party I'm ever gonna have! I've got a big wad of ones in my purse! Really? I mean, really? It's just tea?
I'm gonna get coffee.
Come where?
Shh! Get me out of here.
Yeah. Yeah, I'll be alright.
Guess what. Frank Jr., and Alice got married!
No-no-no, but I am mad! I am mad! Because this stuff is everything that is wrong with the world! And it's all sitting up in my living room and all I can think about is how I don't have that lamp!
Okay. Ooh, y'know we could just do this.
I know where Minsk is.
Hey!
Well, I'm going to the dentist, so listen, okay, just be on the look out for anything that, that, that you can fall into, or, or that can fall on you, or... All right, just look out! Okay, And um, I also just wanna, I just wanna tell you all that um......
Fine! But please God; tell me how to stop them from going off!
Listen, sorry about your death, that really sucks.
Yeah well, maybe she should've spent a little less time decorating and a little more time in the bedroom.
Of course you don't sweetie. You're brand new.
Undo it. Undo it. Undo it.
Oh no, you're not supposed to be here. This is the staging area, you should, it's all wrong, you should leave, ya know, get out. Or perhaps you'd like a creme d'menthe.
What are they?
Okay, so we got some more good rejections, lots of stuff to work on.
Say we are unagi!
How about you less important people, let's open your presents!
Yeah.
It's such a shame you can't see which finger I'm holding up.
I don't know, he just started kissing me. Get him! Get him, Vince!
Yes! Yes you can, I'm looking for Jack's parents.
Oh no, none of them are the father. The father is my brother.
It's just my knitting that's all! Yes! I knit this. I'm very good.
I have a date with this diplomat I met while I was giving free massages outside the UN and, I don't know where his country is.
Yes!!! Oh!!
Oh let me guess, and you wanna have them all at the same time and you wanna have them for your brother.
Ok, Love Story, Brian's Song, and Terms of Endearment.
Hey! So how was the doctor?
Well, just... let's try it again.
Yes! I will have the green salad, umm the house salad, and water's fine.
Good plan.
I know. Then, I'm gonna marry Chandler for the money and you'll marry Rachel and have the beautiful kids.
Shhhh!
I don't know. I don't know. I can't lie to him again. Oh no I-no! I'm just gonna press my breasts up against him.
Which would you rather be a fireman or a swimmer?
Well, OK, the record company sent over this piece of paper for me to sign, saying that it's OK for someone else to sing for me. That was my first clue.
Oh Chandler!
What's your news?
Wow, this is it, I'm gonna meet my dad. This is like the biggest thing ever, huh.
It's time.
Oh-my-God!
Um, well, get over it. So, I mean you, you just seem to be a really nice guy, you know. Don't be so hard on yourself okay.
Do you think that's something that he'd be mad at you for?
I'm wearing his briefs right now.
Noooo!! Damn you ref! You burn in hell!!!
You're there!
Thank you. Can you believe no-one between my apartment and here offered to do that for me?
Hey.
I don't have to tell you everything!
No! Look-look! There's the coffee table they stole from us!
Oh, that's it? A great idea!
Wait, am I missing something though? 'Cause I thought death was something that's supposed to be sad, in a way.
Yeah!
Umm, that paper's two weeks old.
That's not very enlightened!
Aren't you gonna go?
Okay.
No.
It's very weird! I don't want some guy down there telling me, I'm y'know, dilatedamundo!
Oh... Mike's sister just invited me to a party tonight, he's gonna be there. And she was like "Oh, don't worry! I asked him. He's totally ok with seeing you!". So now I have to go so he'll think that I'm totally ok with seeing him!
I have to tie my shoe, so you go ahead, I'll catch up.
What?!
Sure! I feel so bad for you; I broke my leg once too.
Oh, yay!
I don't know. I haven't been out on a date in so long.
No, you have to let me in right now!!
Rosssss can!
Oops!
Ok. Oh good, I'm dating a Russian cab driver. . Seriously does anyone buy this? I smell like beets!
I-I wanna be with her, I like her.
Yeah, so, he had a really funny hat-I don't want to talk about it.
No! But she gave me the box that it came in. It had a picture of the bike on the front. So I would sit on it and my step-dad would drag me around the backyard.
Yeah! Sure! Ooh, I left my purse up at Monica's. I'll be right back.
Happy birthday!
You didn't notice she was wearing different clothes?!
Hey!
Get away from that! No! She's just getting dressed.
How do you feel?
Chandler!!
How can you compare yourself to Gunther? I mean, sure, he's sexy in a more obvious way. You have a relationship with her, you slept together last night.
What stuff?
OK, that makes no sense. Why would the villagers worship a pharmacist?
Okay, so now they know that you know and they don't know that Rachel knows?
Living with you would make me happy.
I remember the day I got my first pay check. There was a cave in in one of the mines, and eight people were killed.
Great! Okay then it's just us girls!
Yes! Very good.
Well, personally I think it's great you're giving yourself a break.
Ooh! A Salami Buddy!
Could you-could you umm, give us one second?
Yeah! Okay-ooh, but are you going to have time to read it?
No, I don't think this was your shot. I mean, I don't even think you just get one shot. I really believe big things are gonna happen for you, I do! You've gotta just keep thinking about the day that some kid is gonna run up to his friends and go 'I got the part! I got the part! I'm gonna be Joey Tribbiani's ass!'.
Should I not have told you?
His first big kid's bike, this is so exciting!
"Gimme your money, punk!"
Okay.
No, nothing.
The most popular Phoebe in tennis is called the overhand Phoebe. And if you win, you must slap your opponent on the Phoebe and say, "Hi, Phoebe!"
He's not backing down. He went to get lotion.
My chest hurts! Oh, and now I-I can't breathe.
So instead you told me Monica was pregnant.
Dance karate?
One, two, three!
OK, no. For your information I'm going to see him so I can put all those feeling behind me. OK, and the reason I'm dressed like this is because I think it's nice to look nice for your gay husband.
Yes you can! Sting says so himself!
Okay, well, this is crazy. Can't seriously be talking about me taking one of your kids, can we?
I'll pull you through.
Like she's really mean, and she's over critical, and-and-No! She will paint a room a really bright color without even checking with you!
I know Mike, why don't you keep digging?
What are those?
I know, they're gonna be so happy together.
Yes, thank you. You see, this is how normal people are supposed to react to drums.
Ooh, I like cards.
Then you better do it now.
Well not so much a pet as, you know, an occasional visitor who I put food out for, you know. Kinda like Santa. Except Santa doesn't poop on the plate of cookies.
What sex?
Plus, it totally ruined my schedule! I...I haven't done any of the things I wanted to do by the time I was 31!
Hey! Why isn't it Spiderman? Y'know like Goldman, Silverman...
Frank! Hi!
All right, we'll se you and Mike at the restaurant in a couple hours.
Oh my God!
Er, Rita, this is my husband.
Oh no! No God, definitely not jealous!
Ooh.
"No time for losers, 'cause we are the champions of the world...!" Thank you!
Go! Go!
Uhm, no. I'm gonna have my friends call me Valerie.
Yeah, I feel great. 'Cause we're moving in together.
Oh we do, but not just yet.
Oh yeah you were helpful! Yeah, no, thanks you.
Maybe all the rulers are wrong.
I will find a selfless good deed! 'Cause I just gave birth to three children and I will not let them be raised in a world where Joey is right!
Lowell, is that you?
Well, I am.
All right, and umm...
Yeah?
No, we were just laughing. You know, how laughter can be infectious.
Just for a second.
Hey!
Well, what you're wearing is fine for that.
Shh! Doogie, shh! Doesn't anybody understand that I'm gonna be having babies soon? Huh? Go! Go little boy, go!
Hey! What are you doing here?
Yeah.
Oh! You know my friend Abby who shaves her head? She said that if you want to break the bad boyfriend cycle, you can do like a cleansing ritual.
Hey Mon? Was it weird changing your name to Geller-Bing?
Wait okay, if this game is gonna cause problems between the two of you, then maybe I should just keep it.
Then why did she ask us to...
You know?!
What are we gonna do? I'm starving.
Mailbox.
My massage client, Arthur? His daughter called and said that some guy that worked for me gave him a really weird massage this afternoon.
I don't know what I'm gonna do about this coat.
Hey!
No, I felt it on my hip. You could tell.
Oh, my friend Sarah had a great time last night.
Definitely!
God, that is the nicest kitchen.
Ah!
Well, on the bright side, now you won't have to see all these paleontologists with their shirts off. Not you guys. You got it going on!
I'm in the shower and I'm writing a song. Stop me if you've heard it. My skin is soapy, and my hair is wet, and Tegrin spelled backward is Nirget.
Found the vest! I mean we're gonna have to keep an eye on it, y'know make sure we don't lose it again...
I... I'm Phoebe.
It's fun, God I love how sexy I am.
Oh! Here it is! Ooh, Joey! Why did you sign it, "Son of a bitch?"
Just for the future, this is hardly a commercial for it.
I miss Rose.
Oh, there's no such thing as an innocent burger.
Be cool! Okay lady, your lurking days are over!
I'm telling you, if you want to take care of that thing, you should go to my herbal guy.
Oh, okay, I learned how to shoot a lay-up, a foul shot, and a twenty-three pointer.
I'm not gonna lie to you, Ross, it doesn't look good. I put a clip on one side, which seems to have stopped the curling.
Okay, I will. This is my husband Crap Bag.
So what did you two do about it?
No.
Uh oh, ooh, are we not getting along with the new boy?
Well, yeah. Y'know, we were best friends, ever since we were little, our Moms worked on the barge together.
Feburary 16th.
For God sakes, it's Rachel!
Or you could end up with everything.
Oh great! And listen, could you do us a favor and not tell Chandler and Monica about this? 'Cause y'know umm, they don't-they don't have any kids of their own and-and this door was like a child to them.
No, it's fate!
What's up? Tell Monica I'm sorry. Tell her yourself!
Whoo-hoo!
By the time anyone's figured out what we've done, we'll be in sunny Mexico. Oh, wait, that's the end of a different plan.
Um, that's it. No. Hey! You! J. Crew guy. Yeah. Why have you been following me? I mean, all week long everywhere I look there's you.
Happy thirtieth birthday! Here! It's for the child in you, and the woman. Happy thirtieth!
Oh yes, no, Richard would never steal your wind.
So?
Yeah.
I dunno, 'cause you're smart, you're funny...
No, why?
Eeeee--ohh!! God!
Uhuh... Yeah...!, you know. And given my life long search for irony, you can imagine how happy I am.
Y'know, I dunno who this is, but it's not Debbie.
Oh sure, Cilantro Larry.
Oh my God! He did it?
Well, not anything, I mean...
Oh, hi.
Hey, dude!
Hey!
Oh-okay, I get the game now.
I don't care, I've never won anything before, I can't believe this!
Ohh, tough call.
Uh, wow! Isn't it ironic that he liked you and now you like him?
Ohh, they gave me a great spot. Right by Macys. Yeah, they hardly ever give such a good spot to a rookie, but I'm the only one who can sing "Merry Christmas" in 25 languages. I lied.
You know if you want, we can sneak the dog back in and Chandler wouldn't even know.
So, I decided I'm definitely going to go with either Joey or Chandler.
Oh! I sous stand.
Oh, she sees him! Oh, they're hugging!
Ooh, uh...
Umm, well I had a similar problem when I lived in Prague.
Rach, Rach, I just remembered. I had a dream about Mr. Geller last night.
Okay.
Well...
Were you guys making fun of Parker?
Okay, well I think that they're in my purse. Why don't you go get dressed and I'll look for them.
Gum!
We're practically kissing.
Oh, I'm going to give him something else besides joy, just...
Oh man.
Oh, good, that's good, but you don't look like you were mugged!
Yay-oh-yay! Okay, I gotta go tell Frank and Alice! Right now!
Okay, look at him. Look at those strong hands. Oh what I wouldn't give to be that can of condensed milk.
Ross!!!
Yeah, I met him when I was playing guitar in Washington Square Park. Ryan threw in salt water taffy 'cause he didn't have any change.
Ah! Well! There you go! Last to know again! And I'm guessing... since nobody told me... this is Paolo.
Okay.
All right, you go.
Oh!
Okay, so... allright... Which dress? You can say "neither".
You guys, why didn't you tell me you were eloping?
Woo-hoo, first weekend away together!
Mm-hmm. Throw me a bone here.
This place is so depressing. If I had to work here I'd kill myself. But you obviously haven't.
Wha..? Again with the nature, what are you? Beavers?
Hey Mikey.
Yes! I know! I know! Yeah! So the baby is totally craving meat. This afternoon I tried tricking it, I made it a soy-burger to make it think it was getting meat, y'know? And I got nauseous.
I just-I just started walking around not knowing what to do next, y'know? I-I started asking people on the street if they wanted massages. Then these policemen, thought I was a whore too. It's been a really bad day, whore wise.
That is so cruel! Why? Why would a parent name their child Bethel?
I'm pretty sure it's gun.
And a glass of tepid water.
Ohh, I think she knows where my Dad is.
And call me!
Every little bit of you!
What?!
Why? Why do I have to learn?
Great!
I did it! I took care of the babies all by myself!
Well, what am I gonna do? I really need my guitar!
please...
Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm, who's next?
Oh, why? What's up?
Okay, good. There you go. Doesn't anyone feel better?
Yes!
Umm, yeah! Today's.
What?
I don't get it.
Yeah?
Marcel?
Oh, it's like huge weight has been lifted! 'Cause look, no hair loss, not a rash, no hives, I'm just so happy! Because no shortness of breath, no temporary euphoria-Oh.
Oh I do! Oh, y'know what? No. Wait a second. I know it's in here somewhere.
What?!
Oh yeah, I totally agree.
Will he know what this is in reference to? And he has your number? All right, I'll see that he gets the message. Bye bye.
What? What?
With?
Come on, like you never talk that.
Yay!!
Ugh, what's right with them?
Now I know that they said that the umm, the hair straightener started the fire but I think I'm partly at fault. You see, I didn't, I didn't tell you but umm, but I-I had recently refilled the tissues and so y'know let's just face it, that's just kindling! So I think it's better that I stay at Joey's.
Well speaking of chiming in, remember the time you burned down my apartment?
Hi.
That is so sweet. But don't you think it's a little too soon? I mean there's so much we don't know about each other.
Your mom was arrested?
Mike Hannigan... will you marry me?
Oo! Is it for my birthday present?
We're all right.
He's right though, the '74 is absolute piss.
Everbody this is Frank! This is my half-brother Frank.
Relax, it's not like we're forking.
Um, I'm getting a lily for my Mom. 'Cause her name's Lily.
Come on, give me something. What's his name?
So how are things going with you two? Is she becoming your special someone?
Ice sculpture? That sounds really fancy! I told you I just want a simple wedding.
Hey-Ooh, how's Hilda? Is she working out?
Honey, that's gorgeous!
Ooh, I just pulled out four eyelashes. That can't be good.
Ursula's fiance?
Yeah... The woman you what?
Chandler, you called Janice! That's how much you wanted to be with someone!
Hey Rach, wanna hear the new song I'm thinkin' of singing this afternoon? I wrote it this morning in the shower.
No, and so there's no one to walk me down the aisle and... well, I would just really love it if you would do it.
Oh! It ended okay. One of my friends shot him.
We won!
What?!
Hey!
Yeah, but I-I-I-I can do that for you, I'm gonna do that for you.
OK, Rachel, why don't you start talking first.
No-no-no, I know, but you and I are different people though, and this is a totally different situation, and I know that I am not gonna regret this.
Come on! Look where you are!!
Wow, I have the spirit of an old Indian women living in mine.
Prove it.
I think he's right. You guys hang out at the coffeehouse way too much.
Oooh! I have something you can do! I have this new massage client... Steve? Anyway, he's opening up a restaurant and he's looking for a head chef.
Hey! What's up? Oh my God! What am I doing?!!
Yeah, I should go to, `cause I'm playing in one hour. Hey, you guys should come hear me, ooh hear me. Ooh, My sticky shoes--eww! Eww! I lost my sexy phlegm!
My mom's gonna be here any minute. I can't do this, I can't give him up. Yes-no, I can. I don't want to. But I can. No.
Joey, it's Phoebe. Did you stop Rachel?
Hey.
Here.
Garfunkle.
What, what are they talking about?
Ooh, good, you're hear! Okay.
Oh!
Well, it helps the bee look tough in front of his bee friends. The bee is happy and I am definitely not.
Yeah, sorry boys, this ride's closing.
Or, we could not tell them we know and have a little fun of our own
I'm just, I'm, I'm, I'm used to playing for grown-ups. Ya know, they just, grown-ups drink their coffee and do their grown-up thing, ya know, and kids listen. This is a huge responsibility. What? Are you gonna kiss me?
Oh, 19! We thought you said 90!
Oh that's good, I guess she'll have a choice between my guy and your weirdo.
Oh, good for you.
No! No!
Uh-hmm.
Well then, you should look with us.
There was a girl, we'll call her Betty, and a guy let's call him Neil. Now I can't stress this point too strongly, this story isn't real. Now our Neil must decide, who will be the girl that he casts aside. Will Betty be the one who he loves truly? Or will it be the one who we'll call Ju...Loolie? He must decide, he must decide, even though I made him up, he must decide!
.and I said Vicrum you can't just call every time you get lonely you know, you, you gave up that right when you slept with Rachel.
Hey!
Well that's no way to sell newspapers. Why don't you try, "Extra! Extra! Read all about it!"
Well I'm sorry, I thought you said it was okay.
I'll be a fool for you. I'm sure, you know I don't mind.
Yes!! Yes! Yes! Yes!! That's my Dad, that's Frank! Yeah! I'm sorry I'm getting all flingy.
Hey. So, what did he say?
Oh my God! I had the best time with Tim last night. He is so sweet! Oh, I can't wait to get sous-neath him.
What's goin' on?
I just talked him into it, don't tell me I have to do you too. The puppet master gets tired people.
Hey!
Why?
Ooh, I gotta go. I found a guy that who could fix up the van for catering.
Ok! I want the dolphin!
What's a Movement class?
Oh, yeah. What's this?
Oh please, somebody tell me I don't have to go to work today!
Don't make me do this again, I don't like my voice like this.
Oh, c'mon, like you tell me everything.
You wanna be on my list too? Keep talking! Has anyone seem my list by the way?
But they don't see all the wonderfulness that I see. They don't see all the good stuff and all the sweet stuff. They just think you're a little...
Just calm down woman!
Wait, Rach! Where's the other one?
Are you kidding? That's what sisters are for. Frank Jr. : Look at them! Aw. I love you so much. Oh crap, don't wake up, don't wake up!
Hey!
All right. All right! If he wants a date? He's gonna get a date. All right, I'm gonna go in.
What?
Unbelievable!
That's him.
Joey, can I have a sip of your coffee and a bite of your muffin?
I know, yeah. Ok, talk to him.
Oh I do, it's.... it's Bob Saget. She hates him.
Uhm, actually no. No, you've... You have to get off the plane.
Well, Ross does. What... You're - you're ruining the plan! Joey, you've - you've fixed him up with his perfect woman!
Really?!
No. It starts with a "v" and ends with an "x". Helpfully with a "to" in the middle.
OK, hi. For your information this is exactly what I wanted. This is a tattoo of the earth as seen from a great distance. It's the way my mother sees me from heaven.
Y'know, I bet it would actually make my grandmother very happy to know that we're trying to figure out her recipe. I bet she's l-l-lookin' up at us and smiling right now.
And why not?!
I will tell you as soon as you thank me for writing my book.
I do.
Wow! I didn't see that coming! You're-you're asking me out!
What stuff?
Oh my God! You dated someone with a glass eye too?!
Hey.
Wh.. what? No wait, you don't get to leave! I've got a massage client waiting outside my door any minute!
And I love Crap.
Oh my god you're right.
You have a... You have a date? With who?
Wait you stole those from these people's wedding?
Oh God!
Ross?
So, are you ready to talk about it?
Yeah, maybe.
Yeah, you've... you know, sort of been like a dad to me. I mean, you've always, you know, looked out for me and shared your wisdom...
Oh well, okay, hey, y'know how when you're umm, you're walking down the street and you see three people in a row, and you say, "Oh, that's nice?"
Well isn't he your friend? Don't you want him to be happy?
No!
What do you mean?
Here, look, alright, does this help?
Because I think it means more to you.
Who was that?
Sure.
Hey!
What I said you had...
Anyway, I'm going out with Sergei again tonight, and um, could you come and be the translator's date? So that when we, it's time for our alone time, you two could split off. Y'know, he's really, he's kinda cute.
Oh, yeah, happy needless-turkey-murder day.
Hi...
DANGER!!!!!
Neither.
Hey!
Listen, I think I've left something here.
I think she took it pretty well. You know Paolo's over there right now, so...
Okay, Seasons Greetings and everything, but still...
Because you're marrying him!
Why are you dressed as a gladiator?
We did have fun, didn't we?
Oh yeah.
He's even kind of cute.
Yeah!
Yeah! And look, see how they expand as the baby grows? And then after the baby's born, they're great for shoplifting melons.
God, what a mess.
Oh my God!
Ah, it's been so long, so long. I can't believe you're still doing this!
Why don't you turn them inside ou...
My mom never gave birth. Oh! But my birth mom did.
Oh hey!
Hey, hey, ok, all right, that's it! Get in here. Come on. My god, you guys, I don't believe you. There are children coming into the world in this very building and your negative fighting noises are not the first thing they should be hearing. So just stop all the yelling, just stop it!
Uhm... You know, once we're in the air and the captain turns off the seatbelt sign... you feel free to roam about my cabin...
Oh, it's Dr. Seuss!
Okay, it's okay.
No.
Hey!
Oh, Gunther, can I get a scone?
Ooh!
Okay!
Oh, my first love!
OH!! MY EYES!!! MY EYES!!!!
It's your thing, and-
Mr. X and Phoebe Buffay.
Okay!
Ohh, tough call.
I love this game!!
Noooo! Ok, maybe if we just break it down. Ok, let's try at one syllable at a time. Ok? So repeat after me. "je".
Hi.
You tired Chandler?
Oh!
Oh no, one of those 'look for the hidden meaning' songs.
Yeah, that does make sense. Ok, now, would... would you two like that?
So, I figured it out.
What?! Monica, I'm scared!!
Yes you do! This is your third divorce! You love divorce so much you're probably gonna marry it! Then it won't work out and you're gonna have to divorce it, divorcing guy. I'm so drunk.
Thanks! Y'know, that when you say things like that it makes me wanna rip that sweater vest right off!
Oh, Paolo, hi, what are you doing here?
Hey! You guys, I'm writing a holiday song for everyone. Do you want to hear it?
Hey!
They live on the upper east side on Park Avenue!
You remember her from my birthday party two years ago. She's yeah, like, average height, medium build, bald...
Ok, ok, you start preparing the formula and I start changing the box and then we gotta put them straight to bed.
It's ok. I thought of the perfect lie for you. It's easy to remember and doesn't invite a lot of questions. You weren't at the parade because you had a family emergency.
G-sharp? Have you been studying the real names of the chords? Have you? Oh my God!
Ewww!
Enh. Sure!
Look, can't we just say that you believe in something, and I don't.
Good! Oh yay! Let's get down to business! Emma needs some makeup!
What's Emma doing today?
Wrong again! Apparently you can change it to anything you want. So I thought, all right, here's an opportunity to be creative. So meet Princess Consuela Banana Hammock.
Yeah, I see what you mean. By the way, nice Ross imitation.
Oh you made it!
It's nothing, it's just- Okay. I'm going through my mail, and I open up their monthly, you know, STATEMENT-
It's like watching porn!
Your own boat?
Yeah... Oh Bitsy, hi. Uhm... listen I just wanted to thank you again for having me here tonight.
Hey, it's your Thanksgiving too, y'know, instead of watching football, you could help.
Oh! The yuk! Ross, he's doing it again!
What is this? What's going on?
Thanks! Honey, would you want me to take your name?
I know!
No, no, I am against innocent trees being cut down in their prime, and their, their corpses grotesquely dressed in like tinsel and twinkly lights. Hey, how do you sleep at night?
Really?
Hey, you!
Well you obviously didn't see Chucky 3.
Well, yeah, because I have to break up with someone, and... Okay so Jason is sensitive, but now so's Vince Plus, Vince has the body y'know? So... It's really just about the math.
Yes, yes, and it's, and we always have to go to, you know, someplace nice, you know? God, and it's not like we can say anything about it, 'cause, like this birthday thing, it's for Ross.
Ja!
I'll get it.
So, um, are you gonna call him?
Alrighty, here come the water works.
Okay, well, I just don't, I don't know how it works exactly. See, my name is Buffay and my husband's name is Hannigan, so is it supposed to be Buffay-Hannigan or Hannigan-Buffay?
Wow, it was so-wow!
Waxine!!
No!!
Hey you guys! Ok, we've got great news.
No one's here! Oh damnit!
Oh!
You have to get a ticket to get past security.
OK, I can be a waitress, I can be a waitress.
No. No, I won't. But I should tell you this, this exact same thing happened to my roommate Denise. She moved in with a guy who was secretly married to her and he said he didn't love her, but he really did, and it just blew up! And that's how she ended up living with me! Okay, that's a lie.
Ok, I've got milk Here you go... Oh! Better?
I am sorry. I am, but this wedding is just really important to me.
Ohh! So, did you get to meet her?
Yeah... All right, well that rules out Lana Titweiller.
Talking to Ross.
I really don't want to mess up what we have. I'm just-I'm worried it's gonna be a big mistake.
Oh, well, it's a shame that you-that you miss the movie 'cause we were gonna see, you know, either "Liar, Liar" or "Betrayal", or... "An Affair To Remember".
Yeah, me, too, technically.
Oy!!
Touchdown!! Touchdown!!
So, do you have any other possibilities?
Oh, I can't believe you! You've been so good, for three years!
Oh, I can't believe you called her fat.
What?! That's the first time today!
Okay, baseball. Rick, playing baseball. Okay, slides into second, maybe even his pants come down a little... Oh no-wait no, no! No! Okay, all right, sandwiches, sandwiches. Umm, okay, on a plate, maybe Rick's pants come down a little. No! No! Okay, Chandler! Okay Chandler, ooh, that's working.
Rdtor.
Ooo, a crossword! Can I help?
Oh! David, get one for us too! Oh, oh, and see if they have a heart-shaped one! And with mirrors on the ceiling!
Hi Ginger.
Ooh! Brian's Song!
Yeah and I-I found you one too who is not a weirdo.
Ohhh. Thanks Chandler they're great!
Yeah.
Okay bye.
How long did you think this barbecue was gonna last?
Yes, she jumped right back up.
That's too much. Sorry.
Well, you know, if you want fashion help, Rachel and I are going shopping tomorrow. You're more than welcome to come with us, right?
Okay, okay, but Rachel's gonna be here too, can't I just ask her this stuff?
Her name is Precious? Is she a purebreed or did you pick her up at the pound?
I know. Use it.
Y'know that's really fair. Y'know? Most guys who have been divorced three times are like 60. Ross, nobody cares about this except you! This-this embarrassment thing is all in your head! Here, I'll show you! Come here.
Me?!
I can't help it. I need the meat. The baby needs the meat.
What are you talking about?
So good!
Yeah, thanks. And listen, can you do me a favor? Could you just umm, wake me up in a couple hours, y'know if you can.
...DUMB, DRUNKEN, BITCH!!! Thank you, thanks.
Are you alright?
He said: Are you seeing someone? And I said no...
So that's what you thought I did!! God! That's not what I do!
What's the matter?
No, Mike, I don't want to kill him! I thought we were just gonna capture him and, and you know, set him free in the country side where he can maybe meet a friendly possom and a wisecracking owl.
No-no-no! We haven't started yet. Where's Alice?
Yeah, and what a great way to say, "I secretly love you, roommate's girlfriend!"
Yeah. We don't speak. She's like this high-powered, driven career type.
See, this is exactly what we do not have time for.
Oh no... Have you thought about it how complicated this could get? What about Ross?
Well, Racquela's right, yeah!
Ooh, erotiery!
Okay.
No, Mike's here.
Okay, sorry. Yeah.
Not with that attitude! Now, haul ass!
What are you, what are you talking about? How did this happen?
Okay, listen Robert...
Hi.
Joey, this is Mary Ellen Jenkins. So, Mike, how do you and Joey know each other anyway?
Huh!
Which you just gave up really quickly.
Such a pig!
Also uhm... I just want you to know what a wonderful man your son is.
Hey, Frank. Look, okay, I know that you think I did like this totally evil thing, but I so didn't. There's someone here who can explain this better than I can.
Come on, do it.
No! No, we have an emergency. Okay? Rachel's coming to London.
I can see that. A plate of brownies once told me a limerick.
Thanks. Hi, um, 'kay. I'd like to start with a song that's about a man that I recently met, who's, um, come to be very important to me. 'Kay.
Oh, hi, Mrs. Waltham. I need to speak with ether one of the best men, or Ross's sister Monica.
What are you talking about? Sarah's great!
Oh, okay then.
Oh, what beautiful lukewarm sentiment.
Hey, were the hell have you been?!
All right. Good luck.
Are you asking me out? 'Cause it would be kinda weird since you just broke up with my sister.
Uh-huh.
No, but you can't.
Ewwww!!
Really?
Are you two talking about the same baby? Hey! Have you started off thinking of names yet?
Unless! She wants to spend the night holding my hair back for me.
No!! wait, wait, wait!! Oh please, hold it up so I can listen.
We thought you knew!
Ooh, this is it! Oh, that's him! That's him!
Okay, ask her 'What is her current method of birth control?'
Well it's just-it's one of those situations that I just hate. Y'know? A massage client gave me three tickets to the Helmet-Pelts exhibit at the Morgan Chase museum.
Ohh! Oh, the Chelsea Reporter, ohh, this used to keep me so warm.
OK.
I'll be waiting.
Yeah well, "excuse me, I ordered the smoked salmon appetizer, but I can't see it, I can't see it"!
Oh, see, Jack did love the cow.
Bras! We bought bras! We bought bras.
Mike knows I'm coming, and if I don't show up he'll think it's because of him! And I don't want to lose face! That's a very serious thing in my culture.
You're Frank's best man?!
You don't have any other choice!
Awww! Now you're just my annoying friend Chandler.
Well then, what about you?! Huh?!
Hey!
For what? I can't believe this! I gotta get out of here.
Hi!
Yeah! In... really long hour world.
Yeah!
Really?
Yeesh, what'd you do about it?
Oh, me too!
Well actually, I know what time Chester and Marcia said.
From the nursery rhyme. 'There was a crooked man, Who had a crooked smile, Who lived in a shoe, For a... while...'
Ohhh.
Yeah well, we'll see.
That's good, you should be impulsive and you should be romantic. Just...you did it with the wrong person. What?
Really?! Oh that's so exciting! Thank you! Thanks Mon! Oh but Mon, if you touch my guitar again I'll have to pound on you for a little bit.
That's it?! You call that a fight? Come on! "We were on a break!" "No we weren't!" What happened to you two?!
Yeah. You're trying to figure out where you know me from? All right, I'll give you a hint. From porn! Okay? Yeah your pervert boyfriend watched me in a porno movie! See?
Oh, I should go, too. Oh, now... tomorrow do you guys wanna share a cab to the airport or should Mike and I just meet you there.
Oh! It will be fun! Ohh! Yay! Oh! Okay, ooh, let's plan the wedding reception. Wow! You really wanted me to do something with this van. Y'know what, I want you to take the chef job.
Ross, I know what you're thinking.
How can you come here?
I know, I'm so excited!
I don't care. We're not paying you 300 dollars for this.
Oh, me too!
Why are you lying to him?
Oh okay. Umm, all right. Hi, this is Phoebe from Empire Office Supplies, can I speak to your supply manager please?
Ohh, you and your ways. Since it's Christmastime. I'm going to be one of those people collection donations.
Most people don't like their jobs, I love my job! I have not been working for three hours and I'm already going crazy. I miss Joan.
That would be great. Thank you.
Ok, thanks.
What about her whining and her constant need for attention?!
Oh.
She's a waitress.
Oooh, I love family traditions like that. When uhm... when Ursula and I were kids, on our birthday, our stepdad would sell his blood to buy us food!
No Rachel! They got here first!
Hi, Bubbles. Manly. Well, I just thought I would drop by and let you know how it went with Joey.
Okay. Is it a kind of hot sandwich?
YOU DID NOT!!!! Oh! No! You came up with Relaxi Cab! That's not good.
Wow, money and a firm hand. Finally a Chandler I can get on board with.
Oh yeah, the doctor said that could be one of the side effects.
Calm down. Maybe you're not pregnant.
Hey.
Hey!
Okay, there.
Hey! Ooh, wow that jacket looks great on you!
Yeah, I had a massage client who worked there and-and he said I had a knack for stocks.
Well, that's not good. But you know, I can move some stuff around, and I'll be there. You and Alice just take the whole day together.
Oh, yeah! Okay! Great! Go, man, go put on your shoes, and, and march out there and meet her! Oh, wait, no, no you have to take a shower, 'cause, eww. No, you know what you have to answer her, answer her first. No, no, you know what make some coffee 'cause its too much.
Okay.
I'll have one, please. Plus my money.
Why, what happened?
But there's a whole table of mini-muffin baskets. Which one did you send?
Yes, and I'm sorry. I-I know things worked out for Chandler and Monica, but that's very rare.
Hey! She will shower when Tibet is free.
...teen!
Wow. So, okay, maybe that means that, you're not over Ross yet and you have issues with your father.
No, I'm just gonna help him, you know, get 'de-Ursula-ized', like you know, like I did for Joey after he went out with her.
Oh okay, well I'm a masseuse, and I used to work at this place...
So far, it kinda blows. I don't know, I just thought y'know that he'd feel more like a brother y'know, like you and Ross, just like close and connected and....
Rachel, calm down!
Here. Y'know, just in case.
But we've only had one job.
Okay, well... guys?
Ooh, God it looks bad.
The woman who cuts my hair!
Uh, hello, this is Ross Geller's personal physician, Dr. Philange.
Oh really. Okay. let me ask you something. Yesterday at the coffee house, I went to the bathroom and when I came back, my muffin was gone-who took it?
See, he's her lobster.
Monica, leave him alone!
Oh, come on! I think he's ready to get rid of, what did you call it? The cheap knock-offs and dinosaur junk.
Oh, that's beautiful.
Yeah, except your breasts look kinda small.
Give her a key to your apartment.
Hey, guys, you know what Larry would say? He would say, "See you ladle."
Yeah we thought it would be nice to use the fancy china for dessert too.
What's in the bag?
Yeah, and they've been coming by all day. They love it!
Oh yeah.
Oh, hey, Mon, do you still have your like old blouses and dresses from high school?
Monica, in or out?
Russ is Ross. Russ... Ross!
You know, did you ride mopeds? 'Cause I've heard... ... oh, I see... it's not about that right now. OK.
Now, we can kick anybody's ass!
...in Reservations at 8:00 by Neil Simon. Thank-thank you Neil. Thank you for the words.
Rachel and Joey! It's Rachel and Joey!!!
Oh alright, stop, STOP THE MADNESS. This is crazy. Who can even remember why this even started in the first place?
What?
Huh?
Is it me, or is veto starting to sound really good?
Yeah, but you've got to pull yourself together! Monica can't see you like this! Then she'll know something's wrong!
...I feel a little sneezy And now I-
Mazel tov.
So, what should you have done?
I mean this poor woman.
Hey! Don't you give me any of your-Hey!
Yeah but the Swing Kings? Y'know they suck so much that people actually die at their concerts-They just stop living.
Oh no! He's not getting away that easy!
Sooo, what's goin' on, huh?
Yeah, well me too, yeah. I think that's the challenge.
Yeah, come to papa.
If you don't sail your boat, what do you do on it?
Yeah absolutely!
Well, you kind of just did. That guy is going to call you tonight. Ross is going to pick up the phone and that's a pretty clear message.
So, how does Mona feel about you and Rachel living together?
Oh, look look look. The last candle's about to burn out. 10, 9, 8, 7... ... negative 46, negative 47, negative 48....
And tell them that in 2 weeks I will once again be a masseuse in good standing!
Oh.
Hi, Mike's place.
Oh, we killed them all.
Yeah you're always singing "Yummy yummy yummy, I've got love in my tummy"
Why won't you let me massage you?
Come on Ross. We're sorry. Please tell us what it is.
Hmm, did you talk to Gary about the moving in thing?
Chandler, Chandler.
Eww, look. Ugly Naked Guy lit a bunch of candles.
Really?
Hi, I'm Ben. I'm hospital worker Ben. It's Ben... to the rescue!
I'm sorry, there's laughing in my head.
Yeah. Well, we called everyone in your phone book and bunch of people came, but it took us so long to get you here that they-they had to leave.
My guy is a lawyer who has volunteer work. And, he has one of these
You cook naked?
But why does it even matter?!
Uh-hmm.
Yeah! You're the best!
Really?! How come?
Well, the only thing you can do. Sleep with Ralph Lauren.
A-Allright, well... I'll call the cab company.
That's like the tenth time I've peed since I've been here!
Fine. All right, I'll give you one pointer. Look out for that bitch.
Yeah. That's what you really want. Yeah, I don't want to be the reason you're unhappy, that would just make me unhappy, and I really don't want to be the reason I'm unhappy.
All right, betting and wagering of any kind, are, I'm sure, not permitted in the happy place. Okay. Just-just, you know, the-the lovely waterfalls, and the, the trickling fountains. And the-the calming sounds of the babbling brook....
Ok Rachel, make a special flan wish.
No I-I meant your costume.
Hey Rach, will you come with me to a dressing room?
What?! Well he never said that to me!
Uh-huh.
I know, you must've won like a contest or something!
A new grocery store. The universe said I was going to meet a nice guy and that's what they gave me? When I get up there I'm going to kick some ass.
It's so good. Oh, thanks.
If it was, would you stop hanging out with her?
And it looks like she put makeup on her!
would you call this girl? thanks-fo-r-a-love-ly-even-ing.
Okay, I'm gonna go too. I'm gonna go to the airport. I figure if I hang around there long enough, someone's bound to leave one of those planes unattended.
Yea. Can I please, please, please talk to one of the best men? This is going to be the last time I promise.
Oh, I-I don't eat meat.
Do you have my birth certificate?
Hello. Oh good. Ross could you put up some of these flyers for me? OH!! Demon!! Demon!!
I'm just saying, get his number just in case. But no Chandler is in an accident and can't perform sexually and he would want you to take a lover to satisfy the needs that he can no longer fulfill.
You are so smitten.
Well, I mean look it's, it's not your fault, you know. I mean this is just what, what she does to guys, okay.
You can still sleep at night and stuff.
Come on more!
Chuck Woolery?
Y'know none of my other student thought I was stupid.
Yeah, y'know what, there are other fish in the sea.
What?!
Yes.
She is so great! I miss her.
All right, so, okay...
Hey, Monica!
Uh-huh, yeah!
Minsk?
: Yeah, um... You know you, you should just forget about what I said under the bridge, I was talkin' crazy that night, I was so drunk!
Wait, wait, why were you at the courthouse?
Mr. President.
Hey.
I saw it.
Hey, what are you working on?
Thanks, Ross.
And because you're both, you know, white women.
Oh, en chante.
It's hard to believe that just a little while ago this was nothing but ingredients.
You just said...
We should do something. Whistle.
Well, I bet that was very hard for him to do.
What's the matter? Why so scrunchy?
No, I've got work and then I'm proposing..
Yay!
No because I chickened out the last time when I tried to meet him. So I mean coincidences? I don't think so.
You mean the one that my grandmother made me swear on her deathbed that I would never let out of our family?
Oh no! No! I know how to handle it.
They're gonna call her Chandler.
Oh, yeah, he clipped on, he said call him as soon as you get a chance, he's at Flimby's.
Hey what are you guys looking at?
I'm hearing what you're saying, but at our prices everyone needs toner.
What?
Oh, you Americans always butcher the French language.
I'm sorry, Ross, this is my old friend Lowell from the streets. Lowell, Ross.
Thank you.
Yeah?
I don't know why I was so nervous about this. And I don't know why Frank and Alice are always complaining. This is so easy.
Phoe-Be.
Bye!
Bye, fat ass.
Ooh! I found it!
Hey!
Your secret bachelorette party...
Oh, this is fun.
And he's going to be paying this woman? Why doesn't he just give her like a throne, and a crown, and like a, you know, gold stick with a ball on top.
I'm sorry, I'm with a client right now.
Okay, we have like ten minutes. Do you want me to get into that now?!
Yeah. So?
Listen if you wanna go, just go.
Great! Okay, if you'll just excuse me. So, did you hear something you liked?
Oh, yeah, right.
All right. I'll do it, I kissed him before I can do it again.
Monica!
I like waking up with you too. Oh! It's such a beautiful morning. Oh, I can stay here all day.
Hamburger. McDonald's. Old MacDonald had a farm, my dad is a pharmacist.
Excuse me, is this your car?
Uh! Princess Consuela.
You guys. I'm sorry about your shopping.
Yeah. See?
Oh, okay.
Well, 'cause, I mean, what if, what if he's not this great dad guy? I mean, what if, what if he's just still the dirtbag who ran out on my mom and us? You know what? I've already lost a fake dad this week and I don't think I'm ready to lose a real one.
Yeah, umm that's Whitney , Kyle's ex-wife out there, now do you think that you can y'know divert her so that we can slip out?
Lilly's dead.
Great! Thank you very much.
Of course!
I bought them off Ebay! They used to belong to the late Shania Twain.
No!! Hey-hey that's not a Nutter-Butter, that's just an old Wonton!
I-I'm with the umm, the 57th.
What?!!
Oh okay. All right, then I need to calm down a little.
Will you excuse us, we need to talk for a moment.
Okay-Oop! Too late! I'm leaving! Come on Chandler let's go!
Hey you guys I'm gonna go out and take a walk.
Oh my God Eric hi! Wait, how'd you get this number?
Yes, while I was in the chair! That's why I take such good care of my teeth now, y'know, it's not about oral hygiene, I floss to save lives!
Well, Gladys say hello to your new home!
Okay. All right you yellow-bellied-lilly-livered-DRAW!!
Ooh, ooh, fun! Okay... um, Liam Neeson.
You mean a backup?
Oh, it's the worst way to propose!
Hi.
I'm Rachel. It's so annoying when I put Emma on the phone to talk with my friends.
Sorry. ..Y'know, those stupid soda people gave me seven thousand dollars for the thumb.
Oh, Ode To A Pubic Hair?
Hi. I just had the worst anniversary ever.
I'm... I'm just... I'm the worst person ever. How can I not tell David that I'm seeing Mike?
Welcome back!
Nobody! Nobody respects the bucket! You wouldn't believe what people put in here! Look! Okay, does this look like a garbage can to you?
Hey you guys, Hums While He Pees just asked me out!
Oh. Why not?
No.
Noooo!!
I just really wanted to apologize again and... and also show you something I think you'll find very exciting.
You didn't get the money, did you?
All right, I can't sit here anymore. I have to walk places.
Why don't you hire him as an actor? You could have him dress up and put on little skits. Whatever you want.
Well, I never call me.
Left! Thank you.
I know! So this woman probably could like have all kinds of stories about my parents, and she might even know like where my Dad is. So I looked her up, and she lives out by the beach. So maybe this weekend we could go to the beach?
What are you two girls whispering about over there?!
Yeah, ooh, I like that! Yeah. Wait! How do you know about 'bah-bah-bha-bhan?'
Congratulations!
Well, I mean, I'm not married married, ya know, he's just a friend and he's gay and he's just from Canada and he just needed a green card.
No... actually, you might wanna stay away from Jane street... that's where stabby Joe works.
Shh. In a minute, I'm gonna create a diversion. When I do, walk quickly to the door and don't look back.
Yeah!
We've got the ground-up flesh of formerly cute cows and turkeys, ew...
You're the cook! With out you it's just me driving up to people's houses with empty trays and asking for money!
Hey!
Which Richard?
Oh!
Oh, I believe it. I think the baby can totally hear everything. I can show you. Look, this will seem a little weird, but you put your head inside this turkey, and then we'll all talk, and you'll hear everything we say.
Ok, all done.
Oh, you came on to Ross!
'Kay, bye!
Hi Emily!
I KNOW THAT!!! You have to stop her!! She's going to ruin the wedding!!
Hey.
No, huh uh, no way, I'm sorry, not gonna happen.
Cute naked guy is really starting to put on weight.
I have new respect for Chandler. All right everybody! It's time to open the presents!
Oh, yay!
Where were you?
oh I dunno I dunno, you know I mean I like him but am I ready to take my grade a loins off the meat market.
He was a lawyer!
Well, I think you're gonna appreciate it the crap out of this one.
No, no, no. I'm sorry. It's "smelly cat, smel-ly cat".
We didn't fool around with any of them. Dwha! Dwha!
I dunno, well he got over the "We were on a break" thing really quickly.
You know, it's a lot less surprising to do that after I've buzzed you into the building.
Cups and ice? Ooh, I get to be in charge of cups and ice? All right. Fine, okay, I will be in charge of cups and ice!
No, we can go together! Just don't wait too long though, okay? 'Cause I'm outta here sometime before Friday.
Oh, okay. Feel better, Rachel, 'kay?
No, yeah, we never find them! She's always best at us that wily minx.
Yeah.
Oh, I know, we should have been more prepared. It's okay. Now, the way I see it, our real competition now is Cameron. Oh my God, they just took her sweater off. Look at those arms! Hello Michelin Man.
Okay Joey? Chandler's here, he was wondering... Okay, I guess he ran out of change.
Hi. Listen, I'm sorry about that whole thing with Roger. It really wasn't right, and I, and I want to make it up to you, so umm, I brought you something that I think you'll really enjoy. Now, this is just a loan. Okay? I'm gonna, I'm gonna want him back. So... I'm gonna go now. I'm sorry, I thought I could do it and I can't!
Yes, and it is my dying wish to have that ring. See, if I'm not buried with that ring then my spirit is going to wander the nether world for all eternity...
I know, I just want to bite his bottom lip. But I won't.
Well-well but it is huge.
No, I know, I know, that this is Frank's life, y'know. Y'know, I don't want to be all judgmental, y'know, but this is sick, it's sick and wrong!
Oh, we were just trying to make Joey feel better.
You guys, we've been waiting for you for a long time, maybe you should order.
Oh no, I don't believe in Western medicine. No, if you just apply pressure to these points right here. Then your hand starts to hurt and you still have a headache, so thanks.
Ohhh!!!
Chandler, you gotta stop staring at the door. It's like a watched pot, you know if you keep looking at it then the door is to, never gonna boil. I think what you have to do is try not to...
Oh my God!
You don't have to do that, Ross and Joey aren't here, you can watch the parade if you want.
You really thought it was perfect?
Ooh, who's it for?
Yeah, but you always say that.
Come on, it's not that big a deal!
It's not a stupid gumball machine looking ring! It's a beautiful ring!
Duh!! Christmas!
Hey. Ooh Ross! How'd the conversation go?
You guys, what was the Powerball number again?
So, I just came from the company Ursula works for.
I lost a whole year! I can't believe it! This is so unfair!
Hey!
You mean the-Okay by siadic, you mean the towel covered portion.
Okay. Whoa, sorry. Why were you just like all in the dark?
What are you saying I should do?
Oh yes, yes, yes you can. Just say, um, 'Phoebe, my work is my life and that's what I have to do right now'. And I say 'your work?! Your work?! How can you say that?!'. And then you say, um, 'it's tearing me apart, but I have no choice. Can't you understand that?'. And I say 'no! No! I can't understand that!'.
I got me some drinks!
God!
Oh. Finally! Oh.
Monica, you might want to remember that you are married. Where is Chandler anyway?
Rachel.
Oh.
Yeah. Yeah.
Pumpkin? Yeah. But did he ever call you like, Budolph?
All right.
You should be!
Oh God, this is turning into the worst wedding day ever! The bride is pregnant. The groom is missing. And I'm still holding this.
Uh-hmm.
Ok, great! All right, bye! Pain in the ass!! That's off, right?
Fine! You're on!
I didn't even think about that! Aaargh, sexual politics!!
All right, I've never been engaged and I've never really been married, but I can only tell you what my mother told me. Whenever you have doubts or fears or anxieties about a relationship, do not communicate them to your husband.
Yeah, I know. It's a real mustard-tastrophe. Can you help me?
Oh ok, Ryan, that guy I went out with, who's in the Navy.
Alright, whadyou do with him?
Don't you see? Everyone's looking at me! The plan's working! I didn't even have to take off my top yet!
Hang on! Hang on! Hang on! Go!! Who's this? Oh okay, you're gonna like working for me. What's your name? What kind of name is Brendy? I... Whatever... Stop talking! All right, from now on your name is Joan. You can pick your own last name.
All right, I'll see you downstairs then.
Oh, thanks. I couldn't uh...
I found you in my bed! How'd you whined up there? You are a mystery! Little black curly hair! Little black curly hair! Little black, little black, little black, little black, little black curly hair............
Wait a second! So, what's new with you?
So talk to her.
Hey.
Because I'm dumping him today.
Wow! See, and I didn't think you'd be able to come up with anything.
Well, this is very generous!
But hes falling in love with her.
Hey!
Oh, some guy she met at the movies.
Hi!
Oh Rachel, this is all so 'Papa don't preach.'
Yeah.
You have a third nipple?
Oh can I? Vegetarians never get to do the wishbone. It's really not fair either! You know, just because we don't eat the meat doesn't mean we don't like to play with the carcasses!
Ok, you weren't there.
Have fun. Oh wait, no, don't! I forgot I am totally against that now.
Well, not so good. Upstate's pretty big, he's pretty small, you do the math.
I know about your feelings.
David's like, y'know, Scientist Guy. He's very methodical.
Then yes that is what I'm having.
Whatcha doin'?
Yeah, it's about relationships. Y'know? The traps, the pitfalls, what not to do, keep going. This stuff is great!
You're sure? You're absolutely sure?
They are. Why?
No! It's a great time, come in...! WOW, hi... Oh my gosh! What are you doing here? Are you back from Minsk?
Good job Alan!
No that's what you do when you want to get the truth out of someone.
Oh! Wow!
Oh! It's okay, you calm down after a while and then people can see how really sweet and wonderful you really are.
Well how would you know?! You didn't even read it!
Oh my God, he's lost it. He's totally lost it.
We could eat the wax! It's organic.
Okay. It's exactly how I'd imagined it would be.
Okay. Okay, you don't have to walk behind me any more.
Wow! You do?
Hey! It's raining. I don't want to fly in the rain. So...
Oh, thank you! Oh... Oh my God, you're RICH!
Half full of looooovvvvve.
Who are you kidding? You just find some guy off the street for me? Oh God! This is humiliating!
Oh no! Why not?
WHAT! WHY?
Well, what period is it from?
Really?! Are you sure?
No no no, doggie please. Oh, I do so wanna love all animals, please no.
You know what, that's it, that's it.
Who cares, it got you here.
Hey!
Here, Monica, look what I got to wear when I play at the restaurant uh, huh wait! Right? I mean, this might even class up the ballad of the uncircumcised man.
Oh, okay, yeah. I put your stuff in her room, and her stuff in your room.
Oh, hey, Chandler I wanna hug you too!
Oh, well hello there.
Check it out! Cup hat! Cup banner! Cup chandelier! And the thing that started it all, the cup!
Yeah! That was so weird, huh?
God, I wish Mike were here.
Hi! And you're going into what grade?
Yeah, yeah. He deserves to do the thing he loves one last time.
This is madness. It's madness, I tell you, for the love of God, Monica, don't do it!! ...Thank you.
So, how are things going with crazy? Has she cooked your rabbit yet?
That might work!
Oh, all right. Oh! Look what we almost took!
Oh, so, how are we doing?
Oh yeah! I-I would like that.
Hey Rach.
Really? From who?
Well, why did you make like a whole big thing out of y'know, everyone has to hang out in the big apartment?
What a neat idea. All your clothes match. I'm gonna do this.
You guys! You guys! You don't have to fight over her anymore. Whoever doesn't get Gladys gets Glynnis.
Yeah. Not looking for dates.
But everybody sings. It's so much fun! Last time this adorable old man got out there, forgot all of the words, flipped outand everyone booed him off the stage. So funny.
I'm-I'm just saying, don't freak out until you're a hundred percent sure.
Umm, yeah, I'd like to go out with you officer...
Wow! Hello, Mr. Chandler.
Um you, you got a minute?
Maybe it was the guy.
Ohh, he left his cell phone.
Yeah, yeah, he talked to her, but she got on the plane anyway.
No, it sucks. I was saving up to buy a hamster.
Uh-huh!
See, we don't need them.
Yeah that was lucrative! Smart like your brother!
No, just a barrel.
Oh, you like that? You should hear my phone number.
I just-I thought you guys were doing it, I didn't know you were in love!
Well, of course it smells really bad. You have your head inside a turkey's ass!
Yeah, he's really great though. He has this incredible zest for life, and he treats me like a queen, except at night when he treats me like the naughty girl I am.
Ooh yeah! Then umm, what goes on top of the salami?
Okay fine! Fine! We'll just have to think of some other way to put the whole 'Who came onto who,' thing to rest! Come on now, think!!
Okay, first I'm not crazy. And second, say it don't spray it. Anyway his name is Malcom, and he wasn't following me, I mean he was, but 'cause he thought I was Ursula, ick. And, that's why, that's why he couldn't just come up and talk to me. 'Cause of the restraining order.
Yeah, but, y'know, it's... it would be like starting on the fifteenth date.
Exactly!
Mike wins?
What?
Easy. Step. How did it get on?
Oh well y'know.
It worked!
Is it Chandler?
Just one last time erm... the marriage thing... there's no wiggle room? None at all?
Okay, bye.
Yes. Not out loud.
Oh my God, everything is such a mess. Why is this happening to me?
Okay.
So are you actually gonna see her again?
Are these for rent! I thought people were just bragging!
Well, maybe it won't work out. Maybe Ross won't like her personality.
It isn't?
Hang in there, Man With Eye Patch, your tray is coming!
Well, deep-deep-deep down!
Yeah, well I had to learn, I was staying at the Y and some off the young men weren't acting Christian enough.
Potato, Potaato.
Oh, it's a key. To be honest, I think I'd prefer the five dollars.
Oh you...you made pesto?
I just wish there was something we could do. Hello. Hello, Coma Guy. GET UP, YOU GIRL SCOUT! UP! UP! UP!
God, what happened?!
Ooh, is it someone in this building? Is it that tall guy from the first floor?
Maybe nobody's tried this.
Yum-my!
It's not that bad.
Monica and Chandler said that you were having so much fun here. And apparently no amount of drums or tarantulas is gonna change that.
Yeah!
So now, what is this now?
Whatever.
Oh, he-he can't talk right now.
Oh, well what are you doing here? Are you about to do it? Is it Gunther?
Thanks, hi. Um, I wanna start with a song that means a lot to me this time of year.
Oh! Since tomorrow. I met this really cute guy in the park and he like y'know, jogs, and blades, and swims, and so y'know we made a deal that's he's going to teach me all sorts of jock stuff.
Okay.
Oh my God, are you guys okay?
What's wrong Mon?
Wait. Really?! 'Cause mine get me out of tickets.
Chandler, you stink of cigarettes.
Yes. Yes! Fine! I am someone! You want me to say it? I have doubts! I'm sorry!
Can I get you something to drink? Like a water and Valium?
Yeah, but he did have to have a bunch of stitches and he said that only once in a blue moon does a dog's ear grow back so...still hoping.
CHANDLER AND MONICA!!!!
That oughta do it.
Ooh that is definitely Chandler, Joey, or Ross. Or-or Rachel!
Yeah, I can't say croissant. Oh my God!
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!! Hey!!! Look what you're doing to Chandler!! Yeah, look, we know this is really, really hard for you guys. Okay? You don't, all right you don't have to love each other, okay? You don't, you don't even have to like each other much right now. But please, you have to figure out a way to be around each other.
Don't take that tone with me. Who you think you are? Alan Lemond, the first black man to fly solo across the Atlantic?
Right! Never! Never! I swear!
You didn't bring one! My cab's downstairs, I'll drive you to the airport.
Come on, you know, Thanksgiving. Ooh, you got the bigger half. What'd you wish for?
That's nice. I like having things to read in the bathroom.
Rach?
Oh my God, you guys are selling the entertainment center?
Well, I taught me and I love me.
Rachel? Um, hi.
I'm not gonna give you tips! Look don't you see that this-this...this all came together so that I could stop you from doing this.
OK. Smelly cat, smell-ly cat, what are they feeding you? Smelly cat OK, sorry. I'm just, I'm just not getting that everyone um, gets how smelly this cat acually is. I just think that maybe if we could talk about this, 'cause I need to feel that you really care about the cat.
How - how do I get them to name the next one after me?
A couple hours.
What is this?
For how long?
What?!
Yeah. Oh! It'll be like I have a wife in the fifties!
I would, but I get my morning sickness in the evening.
Okay, I asked for the news, not the weather.
Ha-ha. No, it's just I'm so pregnant that I-my guitar doesn't fit anymore. So I thought 'til I'm not, I'm just gonna play all my songs on this drum. It sounds really cool!
Sure, I so glad we did this. It feels so good!
Oh, it's like a skit.
No! I'm not finished yet! Don't! Don't you dare hang up on me!!!
That's right.
Yeah, but you've known Rachel since High School and you cannot just cut her out of your life.
Personal shopping? What is that? Like where you walk around with snooty rich people and tell them what to buy?
That's the door. He's gone...
Then do Iceberg!
Oh hello.
No! Oh! You're alive! You're alive!
Are you kidding?
Oh, Jack Bing. I love that. Ooh, it sounds like a '40s newspaper guy, you know? "Jack Bing, Morning Gazette. I'm gonna blow this story wide open!"
Okay! Okay, ready?
Bye, Gene.
What?
Wanna see mine, wanna see mine?
Those are my shoes.
You are unbelievable! I spent so much time finding the perfect girl for you, you know. Mary Ellen is really smart and cute and loose.
"Little, tiny Tarzan, swinging on a nose hair. Swinging with the greatest of ease..." Darn it! Now, I don't know who to get to the next verse.
If she's no fun, why do you want to date her at all?
I don't care... I'll be my something blue.
Oooh! You are a very bad man!
That's right.
Yeah, it's just so strange. I mean, she probably woke up today and thought, "ok, I'll have some breakfast, and then I'll take a little walk, and then I'll have my massage." Little did she know God was thinking, "Ok, but that's it." Oh, but the weirdest thing was, ok, I was cleansing her aura when she died, and when the spirit left her body, I don't think it went very far.
nothing, I'm excited about our date, Mike this is Ross Geller this is Mike Haaaaa.
Three hundred dollars, are you kidding?
No that is the last thing you want to do!
Well, no no, you have to stay back. I, I have the pox.
Oh wait, my grandmother's dead.
Where is Emma?
Yeah!
You guys wanna try and catch a late movie or something?
Yeah, totally.
Ehh!!
Umm, well, umm Grandma died.
I'm sorry, who's this?
Oh, I'll take some of that.
I was preparing you for my-didn't you think I was dead? Did that not come off?
But, also, what happened between you and your Mom?
Oh, hey, hey Nick the boxer let's see what you got. All right ya, put 'em up. Come on.
Huh?
Yeah!
Okay. See?
Hmm, how about my azzz?
I'm kind, caring, and sweet. What's Monica like?
Uh-oh. She may be onto us.
All right, so promise you're gonna wait for her to call you?
Alright, so, can we turn this off? Can we just make it... make them go away? Because I cant, I cant watch.
Um, then yes, it's 'cause of Phoebe! So, you know, it's either her or me.
You know what? Maybe once they start dating, and they see what's out there, they'll realise how good they are for each other.
Mexico! End credits.
Well, I don't...
Do it!
Monica! I'm sorry I'm late! Monica?
Don't be so corny Ross, it's not an after-school special.
Ooh, oh, Rachel, don't look.
Are you sure? I'll bet there's another flight to Minsk in like...
Hey...
Oh, you're a paleonthologist, too! Oh, ok, now, what do you think of Ranion's new theory of species' variegation in segmented arthopods?
Our apartment is ready.
Uhu, uhu... and why do you think that is?
Yeah, and I know you guys don't know a lot about psychic readings, but that one is pretty much the worse one you can get.
Right. Or you might get everything you've wanted since you were fifteen.
Oh no, no, no, no... That's okay, that's okay... I mean, I'm... I am a vegetarian... except for veal... Yeah no, veal I love...
Hey. I'm so excited; I just set up Rachel with the worst guy tonight.
OH!! MY EYES!!! MY EYES!!!!
Hey!-Hey! What's going on?
I don't know.
Rach, it's gonna be okay! You guys are the best!
I, I, I'm hideous.
Why not?
What are you wrapping?
Alright, well, maybe now its not okay.
Um, um. It's huge. Yeah, that's the moment, when-when, you know she stopped being a princess, and became, like, a woman, you know.
How are you? Good. Hi, thanks for coming.
No, you can't let this stop you from getting massages! No look, I have, I have lots of clients that make the same noises you do!
You know, now you're more like, you know like, "Mr. Caring Boss," "Mr.", you know, "I'm one of you, Boss," "Mr., I wanna be your buddy, Boss Man Bing!"
I do!
Fine. All right, fine.
Why couldn't you have just figured this out six years ago?
That's true. Well, is anything you told me about yourself true?
Wow? Really? That's fantastic!
Ok, so... 1800 minus twelve is... one thousand, seven hundred and...
Yeah, yeah I got that.
Oh, just look at her...
Until then, General Grant, why don't you set up camp right there.
Thanks Monica!
Oooh. Girl's night out indeed.
Who's Barney.
Oh yeah? Well, tell me which one, and I'll try slip it in my coat.
Hey, you know what might help you deal with it? Think of it this way, you and Emily are in the past and you can't be mad about the past. So are you still mad about the Louisiana Purchase?
Uh huh.
Good that's a good one. Okay, Monica, anything? Y'know? Does Rachel move the phone pen?
I know! I know! I know!
I know, I know! I'm like playing the field. Y'know? Like, juggling two guys, I'm sowing my wild oats. Y'know? Y'know, this kind've like y'know oat-sowin', field-playin' juggler.
Or! I should rush through dinner with Joey and I can meet David at 9:00!
Please...wait, how did you do that?
Mike Crap Bag?
You said I was boring--Ohh!
Chandler, I found the perfect ring.
Okay, thanks. Yeah, I'll try that.
Hey. Look, I know you've been really depressed lately, so I brought someone over to cheer you up. Right outside this door is a real, live, furry playmate.
No. What do you, what do you want me to be, like some stupid, big, like, purple dinosaur?
Okay. Well there's one down.
Okay, then I'm Swedish...
Nah, I don't feel like playing.
That's not Ralph Lauren. Sounds like him though.
I can't!! I can't!! Noooooooo!!!!!!! You son of a bitch!!!!!
Uh, well I can tell you why. It's, it's because of me. But, y'know what, I only did it because I love you. Okay?
You can't put your cigarette out on a tree!
Oh, wait, she's walking across the floor.. she's walking.. she's walking.. she's going for the pizza- Hey, that's not for you, bitch!
Okay, look you wanna hold onto your food? You gotta scare people off. I learned that living on the street.
Hey!
Chandler, I-I will handle this! How much is it?
Allison's birthday party.
Oh...yes..is this..umm..Emily's Parents' house.
Oh, are we gonna trash that place?
Honey, I wish you would get over her. I hate seeing you like this. Is there anything I can do for you? Do you want to look down my top?
Oh, Boy Scouts could've camped under it!
Well, I guess they're not coming. You wanna just order?
Hi, Max!
Wow! Oh you can just imagine that this is where they kept all the stuff to make their potions.
Come on, play that funky music white boy.
I dunno, let's see! So, okay, I dreamt that we were gonna get married, and he left, becuz he had to go fight a fire. And, um, so okay, I went to a night club, and I saw him making out with a girl.
Great, I'm seeing water rings again.
Interesting.
Thank you. We both forgive you.
Ahhh!!
Thank you!
What?! Really?!
I know, I know, and I was gonna get it but then he came in with this needle and uh, di-, did you know they do this with needles?
Oh, I'm sorry. Is that annoying? And speaking about being selfish in bed, how's Whitney?
Oh no.
Yep, lipstick and a daughter, big day for you!
Yeah! No, that's right. And I thought it was a really good idea.
So, Sebastian, do you do any volunteer work?
But Monica, he loves his job so much! Can you just give him another chance? Please?
I'm a lady Monica, I don't kiss and tell. But this hickey speaks for itself.
Hi! Oh, Alice, hi! Thanks. I'm so glad you could come, 'cause I've got a real umm, Home Ec emergency.
Okay. Oh, no!
The donation we made earlier, we k..., we w..., we want it back.
Hey, do you think this is why Chandler took off?
Hey!
Okay, ah, before you get all talky again, umm, could you also please tell Sergei that I really like his suit.
Why?
All right, me too. Should we wake her up?
Hey.
No you didn't.
Um, well, Max told me about Minsk, so congratulations! This is so exciting!
Oh? And how will you know what time to come over?
We didn't have sex.
I just, I just have this really strong feeling that this cat is my Mother.
But look Chandler, right now, no one has a lower opinion of you than I do. But I totally believe you can do this.
So, what movie should we see?
Ohhh... Sure, yeah... ..okay, it fits.
Listen, Robert's gonna be here any second so, will one of you just tell him?
Well, I'm not sure. I mean, I guess until she y'know, gets used to the fact that there's y'know, a new mom. Y'know, I think she's worried that y'know, she's gonna, she's gonna be replaced. Well, that's not gonna happen is it? Noo. Okay, I have to return a call in the other room.
Hey!
No. It's all right; it's probably false labour. They said that, that can happen near the end, just somebody get the book.
Would you care to venture one?
Hey!
Ohh, no. Oh okay, so you're a cop which means you can park anywhere, 'cause I know that 'cause I'm a cop too. So, all right, keep up the good work. 10-4.
Yeah ok, well at least I didn't let some guy into the forest of my righteous truth on the first date.
No, I know, I'm just nervous. Y'know it's just y'know Mom's dead, don't talk to my sister, Grandma's been sleeping a lot lately. It's like the last desperate chance to have a family, y'know, kinda thing. You're so sweet to wait with me.
Chandler.
Yuh-huh! I was the last one to know when Chandler got bitten by the peacock at the zoo. I was the last one to know when you had a crush on Joey when he was moving in. Looks like I was second to last.
Oh, well he's yummy. We did a little kissin'.
Hi Geller-Bing residence. How can I help?
Hey, and then lunch.
And also, we don't know what to do with this.
Oh no! Why?
I'm sorry.
Okay, okay. If I were omnipotent for a day, I would want, um, world peace, no more hunger, good things for the rain-forest...And bigger boobs!
Soul mate.
"You wish."
Okay do you-Okay, do you have a search warrant? Because the last time I checked this was still America!
Yes there are! There are totally good deeds that are selfless.
Ya, you know, Rachel ... she'll do whatever you want. Y'know, you can just walk all over her.
Yes I did! Meet: Princess Consuela Banana Hammock!
Why?!
Okay, yeah well, good news, you're going to have three babies.
Ohh!! Ohh!! And I love you!
Oh.
I had to bring them! We killed their mother, they're our responsibility now. You know, they require constant care. You should know that, Rachel, you're a mother.
In the cab, on the way over, Steve blazed up a doobie.
Yeah, I've been around.
Your boobs are fine. Look, I never should have said anything. Come here. Come here. Oh, can't make.... hands... meet....
Yeah, that was Leslie calling again to see if we can get back together. That's the twentieth time today! And good luck Leslie!
You'd already broken up.
I know. We didn't do any of the romantic things I had planned, like having a picnic at Central Park and ya know, coffee at Central Perk. Oh I just got that.
Ah, ah.
All right. I gotta go. I have break up with Vince.
Okay, you have 19 questions left. Use them wisely. Come on Joey! You can't win if you don't ask any QUESTIONS!!!
Oh did you-what did you-did you work for two days straight?
So you're gonna move?
Jason?
Oh, I would love to have kids. . . you're, you're the, you're, me play the songs that I will write for them.
Maybe we can like go to a movie or something.
About how good your cards were.
Okay, dime! You guys should probably keep talking; this could take a while. Oh no, wait! Look it! Whoa! Oh my God, this is a police badge!
OOOOOHHHHH! Fine, I can't take it anymore! I'm putting an end to this!
Right. Except that I do want to get married.
Umm, Wethering Heights. I'm taking a literature class at the New School and I have to finish it for the first session tomorrow.
That's ridiculous Rachel, we were all babies once. Oh, you mean today.
Whoa-whoa-whoa, you guys, do you know anything about chicks?
Nope, not knocked up yet.
I'm sorry, I can't do this. I'm not an actor.
Uh.
Oh, thank God, 'cause that thing's really creepy! Look, there's Chandler.
Here, now I don't eat chicken, so it's just noodle soup. And there's no chicken in the broth either, so it's really just... noodle water.
I don't know. You could tie her up, she could tie you up; you could eat stuff off each other...
Well, I've never gone this fast before.
What?! No! It was my idea!
I have liver damage. Ow! Oh!
Yeah, yeah, I'm going to be out there spreading joy to the people. I mean, last year, I spread a little joy but not really enough. So this year, I'm going to do the whole city.
Oh, this is so exciting! You get your picture back up on the wall of fame! Eek!
Okay. Okay, but you can't fire him today.
Oh.
Mmmm hmmm.
Just pretend they're not even here! It's OK Monica, when that spotlight hits you it so bright you won't see anyoneanyway.
Hi, this Phoebe from Empire Office Supplies, can I speak to your supply manager please? Earl, thanks. Hi Earl, this is Phoebe from Empire Office Supplies I'd like to talk to you about your toner needs.
Oh?!
least you've been married, OH MY GOD! I wanna trade lives with Ross.
He says, that he would cremate my fur coat for free if I umm, y'know, bring in the next person I know who dies.
I know. They should be a family. They should get married and have more children.
Hey, excellent, excellent water-table thing.
Ooh! Ooh! And I brought Operation! But, um, I lost the tweezers, so we can't operate. But we can prep the guy!
Well, just buy the damn boat!
Well, yeah! But I'm not gonna take anymore crap. Okay? No more Mrs. Nice Bucket!
Okay, then you don't know what it feels like when one of them comes back. Do you? I believe this is my Mother. Even if I'm wrong, who cares? Just be a friend. Okay? Be supportive.
Hey!! The charity's on fire! Help! Oh good! Thank you, I need that. Whoa! What is that?! It's nine o'clock in the morning!
Right, and its me.
There he goes, your fiance.
What if the husband person is the wrong guy, and you are the right guy. I mean you don't get chances like this all the time, if you don't meet her now, you're gonna be kicking yourself when your 80, which is hard to do, and that's how you break a hip.
What are we going to do?!
Jeez, you say one thing, and...
I hate this. 'Cause I tell you, I had the most amazing two weeks planned for us, and almost everything I had in mind, we had to be a lot closer than this.
Okay, don't worry. You're ready.
Really?
Right there! That's why I'm marrying you!
Yeah. Let's see, my had Mom killed herself, and my Dad had run off, and I was living in a Gremlin with a guy named Cindy who talked to his hand.
Well, we should go.
Hey, Joey, when you said the deal with Santa Clause, you meant?
Oh, Rachel!
Oh, the Angelica!! Go! Go! You didn't get the annulment?!!
Ohh!
He-hee!
No, I think I can come over. It's Saturday, right?
But they're not!
Oh my God! Monica's gonna totally freak out!
Nu-uh!
Yeah. Yeah, that's what you need a good...pill.
And how none of it matters when the people really love each other. And how people will believe anything you tell them as long as it's a compliment.
Okay. Then he still has this huge decision to make. Now he's walking around thinking, 'Do I want to be a dad?' and then bam!
What's that now?
What-what are you talking about?!
Okay. But the question is who's gonna go first. 'Cause whoever goes second is the bitch.
Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs!
Hey, have you seen Frank Jr., 'cause he's meeting me here with the triplets.
What? They will be!
We did! We violated Section 12 Paragraph 7 of the criminal code!
Oh, I missed you so much!
Please!
Oh, he has a gig. I kinda like being married to a rock star, you know. My husband has a gig.
Ok, I talked to the vet, people are so nice upstate. Anyway, he said that the little fella's gonna be ok and I can pick him up tomorrow.
Oh whoa-whoa-whoa! Wait a minute, open up your hand; let me take a look. Quarter. Dime. Lint? Not interested in that. What's this? A Canadian coin? Get outta here!
What?
Excuse me, but umm, isn't he paying for your dinner?
"Hi, it's me, I'm coming over now. Hey, what if I'm already there when your playing this message?" Is that too spooky?
It's a normal Swedish name... Ikea...
Good for you!
No, I mean I was really acting my ass off.
Hello? Hey Joey!
You apologize to the tree right now or I am calling for backup. Backup! Backup!!
I'm totally getting it!
Well, he came in for a massage and everything was fine until...
600.
My God! What did you order?!
Oh my God! How bad was it?
Actually, it makes us feel that big.
Oh my God! Is that him?
Oh, Rachel.
No, I can spot you from here.
Okay, not a fan of the tough love.
Nice!
Oh that's my grandma. And thanks Joey she's having a really great time.
Yeah, 'cause otherwise someone might get what they actually ordered.
Oh yeah? Come and get it.
We want the last six years back!!
Oh no, we have to!
Umm, no, it's a purse. And there's a thermos in it.
How could it not be? I mean pretty soon they're gonna be having kids, and then they're just gonna be hanging out with other couples who have kids. And then maybe they're gonna have to leave the city to be near a Volvo dealership.
Listen, Mike, if you were Swedish and you were saying the word "lorkins" what flowers would that be?
Wow, you told your dad the truth.
Oh God, I tried everything to make myself feel better. I even tried writing a song about it... but... I can't think of anything that rhymes with AARRGGHH!! Hey Monica, I really need your help getting through this...
A teacher?
No, you are not, you are very attractive. You know what, I go through the exact same thing. Every time I put on a little weight, I start questioning everyting.
Because, I'm just, I'm incredibly anal and an unbelievable control freak.
OK Joey, your bet.
Well, we were um, sorta invited to go skiing, y'know Rachel's sister's cabin.
David?
Well, of course I would want to see you. I...I think about you all the time.
Okay, well umm, I know that we haven't talked in a long time, but umm okay, our Mom is not our birth Mom. This-this other lady is our birth Mom.
Do you wanna get to Rachel in time?
Wait, what was that? That sounded like someone being nice to you.
Yeah, I really liked that fighter pilot one.
Oh-oh, that's your thing.
Oh my God, you look so good!
Huh?
Well, yeah! Fun is good, but y'know I also wanted to learn. Y'know, people are always talking about what they learned in high school and I never went to high school.
Well you all know that I'm a pacifist so I'm not interested in war in any way. But y'know what? When the revolution comes, I will have to destroy you all. Not you Joey.
Ohhh!
Well, like acoustic folksy stuff. You know? But right now I'm working on a couple 'Iron Maiden' covers.
Hey you guys! Ok, you're not going to believe this! I just saw my psychic and she said I was definitely gonna win the lottery tonight!
Fine!
Oh, God!
Oh no wait no, this is wrong! Ross isn't here!
Anyway, I should go. Okay, bye.
Not even if you just pretend that it's milk?
Well, you're not, You're not... you're not... again, you're not SPEAKING FRENCH!
So you still hadn't heard from Emily?
Oh down please. I-I hate to be a ball buster can I just do it?
Hey.
But, can't you leave the dollar? This money is for the poor.
Dinner was good!
No that's just me coughing! Oh, good, there you are! Listen, um, I have a dog in my room.
I don't know, I mean, he's a good person, and he can be really sweet, and in some ways I think he is so right for me, it's just... I hate that guy!
yeah well yeah you know Emma's birth certificate might say Geller but her eyes say Mookurgee.
Hey! Umm, well, only okay because I just got back from, from the hospital.
No, but you're questioning my method!
Okay. Ooh, I see a ladder. Which can mean either a promotion or a violent death.
No that made me feel precious.
Yeah, all right.
Hi!
Here he is.
Monica, I'm sorry I didn't come by last night. I was out with Gary; he let me ride around with him in his cop car. We saw and prevented crimes.
Well, umm, not much. But, I was just thinking that since those guys just got engaged that maybe it would be nice if they had some privacy, y'know? So, could I just move in with you for a couple days?
Yeah?
Okay, we-we'll talk to you later. Okay, bye.
Yeah!
Ok, so, ok, was he holding you? Or was his hand like on your back?
Yeah, we both can. And we both will.
David! What-what are you doing here? Aren't you supposed to be in Russia?
Hey!
So when, when do you leave?
Wow! How long were we arguing for?
Yeah?
Yeah. I just need you to bring me some photos of Ross.
Hi! Yeah, I'm calling on behalf of Monica Geller's eye, and is um, is Richard Burke in today. He's out of town, but does she want to see the on-call doctor?
All right, all right, so up until '92-93 he was very trusting, then '94 hit, Carol left him and bamn! Paranoid city!
Yeah. Ok, you don't have to believe me but um, can you think of any unfinished business she might have had, like any reason she'd be hanging around?
Oh.
Janice? You called Janice?
Wait, you know what, I got a little story. When I was in Junior High School I went through this period where I thought I was a witch. And there was this guidance counselor who said something to me, that I think will help you a lot. He said okay, 'you're not a witch you're just an average student.' See what I'm saying?
Hey!
What the smell from Joey's? No, I can hardly smell it over here.
Well, kinda. Yeah. Yeah.
You know her?!
Hey! You could do a lot worse than Joey Tribbiani!!
Quite an interesting turn of events, suddenly it's my book to the rescue, huh? Ooh, very interesting. Yeah, well this certainly clears things up.
Oh, I took Larry there to eat but it was all violated. So we shut it down!
Like okay I-I-I, I haven't met any Portuguese people! I, I haven't had the perfect kiss! And I haven't been to sniper's school!
Morly Safer.
No, no, I'm fine, and y'know why? 'Cause of all the riboflavin.
My dear, sweet Rach.
Wait. Why was he yelling at her? He's the one who slept with someone else.
And no, oh please, oh please let me finish. Oh I guess that was it.
Oh my God, they took my idea!
Hell, I'm drunk right now! What? I can't have a mimosa with breakfast?! I'm on vacation!
A little bit, yeah.
Yeah, it's weird. I can't help it though he's so sweet, he's like this little puppy dog, y'know? But like a really tough one that shots bad guys. Ohh, I just love beginning parts of relationships, y'know?! You just like can't keep your hands off each other.
Oh! Joey uh, were you in our room last night?
well it was awful every time I thought about what you said I started crying.
What's going on?
And why not?!
Oh yeah, oh, she went to the salon alright...
OK. I just met this producer of this like, teeny record company, who said that I have a very fresh, offbeat sound and she wants to do a demo of Smelly Cat.
Yes.
Because I just didn't know how much I wanted it. And I love you, and I wanted to live with you.
God, I woke the beast. Sorry. I was wrong obviously, I just-I misspoke. It's okay.
Ok, all right. We want to hear everything. Monica, get the wine and unplug the phone. Rachel, does this end well or do we need to get tissues?
Now, that's trash. Young lady, you can't... Hey! Stop that young lady, she donated trash!
Well, this doesn't have to be so sad though. Y'know? Maybe instead of just thinking about how much you're gonna miss each other, you should like think of the things you're not gonna miss.
Oh. Ah-uh.
My Father is Chuck Magioni?
Um, we went shopping for um, for, fur.
It's me. It's Phoebe. Listen there's something in here I want to eat, what-what smells so good?
Oh.
Yes. Definitely! Yes! Let's live in an apartment that we both live in!
Yes, and apparently he is married to some singer, but he said he would leave her for me. And I said, "James, James Brolin, are you sure?" James Brolin said...
Umm, not without you, lover. So, this is my bra.
A dollar?
What, what's about to happen? I've never seen this part before. Hey, Travis, watcha doin' with that gun? Oh no, no no Travis, put down the gun. No no no no, he he's your buddy, he's your Yeller, no, no no, the end, THE END.
Marcia and Chester.
Okay.
Oh! I'm sorry Rachel, I don't have time for your childish games, ok? I still have to go find something incredible to wear so I can beat Mike at "who's more over who"!
Um, yeah sure. Why you wanna call your Mom?
But I'm a professional! And I'm really good! Look, if you're uncomfortable we can stop. Just give me a chance, okay. Please?
Woo-Hoo! The curse is broken! I called everybody I know, and everyone is alive.
All right, I'm sorry.
I don't-she said y'know that I'd have triplets! But she also said one of them would be black.
How much was it?
Yep. Put more gas in.
Wow! I'm-I'm so happy for you guys. This is so-so, not stupid.
Sure! Yeah! Las Vegas, number one!
It's not in the apartment? Oh no. I can't believe this is happening again.
What, what is that?
So?
I'll have coffee.
Ooh, this is cool...it says in some parts of the world, people actually eat the placenta.
Our mom.
Okay! Okay! Okay!
All right. I'm gonna go to the fertility doctor and um, see if I'm ready to have Frank and Alice's embryo transferred into my uterus.
Yeah I guess, a little.
You must think I'm crazy.
Uh, Rach, hang on.
But y'know what? It just seems that you two belong together.
Or you could stick a fork in an apple!
I need to talk to you, it's pretty urgent. It's about Monica and Chandler.
Yes? Yes! Oh.
and...
Well, then you should come tonight. You know, just hang out with them. Let them see what a great guy you still are.
Remembered what?
Jack!! Hey!
Ick-neck-tree-anis..... There's a 'g' in there.
Hey.
You're right, you're right. Ah, you are so yumm.
No, but let's come back to that later!
Oh, this one's for Chandler. Here.
That's a, that's a long time.
She was acting, she was pretending like she hasn't heard from him on years, but I found this picture on her fridge, and look ! Isn't this what he would look like now?
Okay, I wanna be sexy again so I'm trying to catch a cold. It should be easy, supposedly they're pretty common.
No, but it sounds like it was fricken funny...
Well, that would be great but then what do we do about Denise?
Don't worry about me, I'm a robot! I'm just a machine!!
Monica slow down! Ok? I'm just excited to be living with him. You know I mean, I don't know, Can I see someday being married to Mike? Sure! Yeah. Y'know..I can picture myself walking down the aisle in a wedding dress that highlights my breasts in an obvious yet classy way. But do I want that house in Connecticut...you know..near the good schools where Mike and I can send Sophie and Mike Junior.. Oh my god I do.
Oh, you so would! Oh, you should get that anyway. Like for clubbing.
That's right, I've prepared a song for Emma. From my heart to hers. For there's no greater gift, than the gift of music. Emma! Your name poses a dilemma. 'Cause not much else rhymes with Emma! Maybe the actor Richard Crenna, he played the commanding officer in Rambo. Happy birthday Emma!
You're still gonna go out with her?!
Hey, maybe they meant to write, 'Quiet, bitch.'
I wanna join!
Yeah, she came all the way back from Ross' building. Oh, the things she must have seen! And then she climbed up the fire escape and she tapped on the window with her teeny little paw and then we ran to let her in... I went to far, didn't I? When should I have stopped?
Yeah?
Mon, maybe one of these guys wants to wear your dress.
Wow, a year and a half ago I didn't even know I had a brother, and now I have a sister too. Okay. Okay. Stop it, don't. So, I gotta get you a gift now. Is there anything you need?
Okay, so maybe you don't get her a ring. Maybe you-maybe you do something different. Y'know? Maybe you get her an engagement bracelet, y'know? Or an engagement tiara? Or-ooh! An engagement Revolutionary War musket! (Picks one up from the display in the corner.
Chandler, your being here is the best Christmas present I could have ever imagined.
There you go! Oh, you are so lucky! You might actually get to meet Sting tomorrow! That's why you have kids!
After he passed out, we put the sand around him to keep him warm.
I am extremely talented!
Okay! Oh my God! My first bike! Thank you for the best present I've ever gotten.
Hey, tell him about Relaxi-Taxi, and-and ask him if he thinks that's better than Relaxi Cab.
Oh, is that you?
But why didn't you just tell her the truth.
Oh, that is so unfortunate.
Ohh that's so sweet! Oh! Hang on! Hang onnnnnn!!! Go!! No! No-no! I said sell when it hits 50! 5-0, it's a number! It comes after 4-9!! No, it's okay. It's okay, you're allowed one mistake. Just kidding, you are of course fired.
Umm, wow. This-this isn't gonna be easy. Umm, I don't think we should see each other anymore.
Hello.
Yeah, eight of them. That's 56 to him. You know also, if, if it's raining, you can't let him look up too long 'cause that cone'll fill up really really fast.
's a good toast.
Oh my God! That guy at the counter is totally checking you out!
You know, what I think is so great that you are totally into this person and yet for all you know she could be like 90 years old, or have two heads, or. It could be a guy.
Oh. Oh!
No it's not, sorry.
All right, I think I'm gonna head out.
Oh weird, Chandler just told us he's got a conference there!
Hi.
No, I-I mean your-your old best friend, here. Lily, from high school. Remember?
Okay, look I-I-I do something nice, okay? I'll-I'll fill her ice trays.
Oh, no. Don't you hate it when people aren't there for you?
Oh my god! Where are you?
Oh no, Bonnie's the best!
Me too!
And to knowing that your career doesn't mean everything.
Yeah, but y'know, about have of these are gonna end up getting divorced.
I'm not going along with some lie you made Ross, No I'm just gonna be honest with him.
Talk about crap. Try listening to Stella Niedman tell the story of her and Rod Steiger for the hundredth time.
Oh my God! You're right! Go! Go tell Chandler! Hurry before it's too late! Wait no! Does this also mean putting out doesn't get you love?
Really?
I've always wanted to live with a guy. "Pick up your socks!" "Put down the toilet seat!" "No! We're not having sex anymore!" It's gonna be fun!
Huh, I might be losing interest in this.
Thats a great movie.
Wher-where have you been?
Ooh, who's it for?
You guys kissed!!!!! What does this mean?!! Are you, are you getting back together?! Can I sing at your wedding?
I'm sorry, but sometimes they need help. That's fine. Go ahead and scoff. You know, there're a lot of things that I don't believe in, but that doesn't mean they're not true.
All right. Hold on. I got it. Nickel! How much more do we need?
No, it's just that he got this new like home theater dealie, and he wants y'know, us to check it out.
Oh, witty banter. Well done.
Um, were you planning on kissing me ever?
Oh my God!
Well at least all my songs don't taste like garlic. Yeah, there are other ingredients Monica.
Well, umm, my Mom's friend, Phoebe, is actually my birth Mom.
Or, or, y'know, um, 'I think we should see other people' means 'Ha, ha, I already am'.
Yeah, just, okay, look I'm going. Um, come on. Op, op, behind the pillar, which way am I gonna go?
Wow. What are you gonna use it for?
Okay!
Cool Aunt Phoebe. I am pretty cool!
What?
Yeah, it all just came screaming back to me. So how's the game?
You can't do that!
I ate a bug.
So um, so what's up, you came to see me yesterday.
Oh, thank you so much! Okay.
OK, well then what is this?
YAY!
Okay, it's in spasm.
Okay, watch, learn, and don't eat my cookie.
Ok, then maybe it'll be, uhm...
Huuh.
Hey, y'know what might cheer you up?
I know! But if I didn't work there, what else would I do?
Ooh, I'll go in on that with you! I couldn't think of anything.
What is that?
What?! What else did you do?
Oh good! Because we have an "I'm sorry" song.
This is how I look when I'm turned on!
I-We gotta get Monica.
Man, tough week for Estelle!
I sense these things. It was either but or butter.
Yeah, isn't it fantastic?
Oh, they love your casserole.
Ok, don't hold thy breath!
Oh, well um, not right now. Y'know I'm just gonna go to bed, I think the fumes are giving me a headache.
Hey, Julie! Hey, how are you doing?
Ooh, this is so exciting! Ooh, God, what are you going to bet?
What else?
Hmm, okay, total abandonment. Okay, reasons for abandonment, A. Top secret government work, B. Amnesia, or C. Or you're just a selfish, irresponsible bad, bad man?
That's really beautiful. What does it mean?
There she is!
Well, it's not so much that you know, like I don't believe in it, you know, it's just...I don't know, lately I get the feeling that I'm not so much being pulled down as I am being pushed.
Ok, ok, so how should I do it?
Oh, Jason? Yeah, uh-huh, we're seeing each other tonight.
What? Did you go to a costume party? Let me guess umm Pancho Vila? and you're Bob Saget.
Ah-ha! A classic sign of love, the hug!
Oh my God.
Oh that's a nickname we were trying out.
No.
Okay, woo! Hi.
Oh my god, we killed Bob!
Why is Ross doing that?
Well, at least you didn't rent yours from a store called, "It's Not Too Late."
Well alright, looks like you guys have got it under control so I'm just gonna go. No! Really? Misery really does love company. All right!
Good!
Oh, well, see, there's this guy she met at the...
Oh my God! May I just say that you two gentlemen have the exact same hands! They're identical! Now, I've never seen anything like that in the business world.
By the way, it's a costume party.
Okay so, by melting, you meant melting.
Okay, and then this is the coffee house. This is where I play my music.
Hello?
Hey.
Um, that's ok! Ok. All right. Now we need the semen of a righteous man.
I don't know. They're so perfect for each other; it's crazy.
But it's just so unfair that our date has to get cut short just 'cause some guy shot at a store clerk.
There was a pregnancy test in the garbage, and it's positive. Monica's pregnant. So I guess she won't be totally alone.
Hey! Joey! Hey! Hey!! Wow!
Oh yeah, so you know D?
I can see that, 'cause they both have those big brown eyes and, ya know, the little pouty chin.
Great! Ok...I'll go get the tube top.
Are you kidding, I love it!
Oh, I wanna see! Lemme see! Lemme see!
No you can't quit college! No! You're in college? Really?
Okay, now you're just taking lines right out of the song!
Oh, yeah try that. So, is that better?
Yeah!
Oh yeah! Oh, I can do that.
Yeah. Its just, you know, its this whole stupid Ursula thing, its...
Oh. Hey!
No-wait-no-no!!!!!!!
Oh no, no. I can't choose between you two! I love you both so much!
I don't know. I mean, she obviously has some kind of unfinished business. Sit up!
Yeah, no, I understand.
No, I think we killed it.
Uh-huh. Now you can turn around or you can go in there and rip the Band-Aid off. What to you want to do?
Shh! Nothing works with this child!
Thanks.
Well, how much do you think he needs?
Okay. Bye!
They have the best stuff in there.
Y'know, me, Rachel, the birds, the babies...
No, 'cause you just said dad and everywhere I go today I keep getting signs telling me to go see my father. Like when I was walking over here and I passed a buffet...which is my father's last name.
Oh... then I overpaid.
Tell us what?
Oh, Ross, Mon, is it okay if I bring someone to your parent's anniversary party?
It's okay. Go ahead, ask me out.
Oh! Get off!! Ow!! Oh, stop it!! Why?! Why are you doing that to me?!
Yeah, I really do. You know, I had nothing growing up. Just like the kids I took the money from.
Y'know, for once, I am going to sit down and try to watch one of these things. .
Doing it on this table.
All the time when you're cooking.
Give it.
It's interesting that you lost. Now, I forget, do you like to lose?
Ooh!
Yeah, you don't wanna live in Westchester. That's like the worst of the Chesters.
Yes, I did it!!! I nailed it!!! Yay! What's next?
Chandler's knees. Chandler's... ankles. Chandler's ankle hair. Oh no. Okay, you're all set.
Here.
See? Vegetarianism benefits everyone.
Right- where we've been looking all night!
He works with food!
I know. This is really, really huge.
Wh-what do we do?
Hey Rach, you wanna get some coffee?
I don't know, but we're having dinner tomorrow night, so I figured, she's gonna tell me then. Y'know maybe she just wanted to give him time to, buy me presents, I don't know! So, you're all bored?
Hey.
Okay that's so generous!
No, I'm fine. I'm great. I'm with you.
Do you like car games?
Well, it's not okay, because I gave a very memorable performance as the nurse. And now suddenly I'm the waitress? That's gonna confuse my fans.
Oh good!
All right.
Oh, oh, but y'know, you always see these really beautiful women with these really nothing guys, you could be one of those guys.
You guys make a very attractive couple.
Terry's a jerk, and he won't let me work, and I hate Central Perk!
Oh hey Ross oh I'm so glad someone's here could you zip me up?
If I let go of my hair, my head will fall off.
Was it really that bad?
What? What? You guys, what is going on? You not like Robert? Why are you laughing?!
The voice woman. Ya know, I mean, she has a great voice but she doesn't have a video.
I'm not done yet, OK. God. OK, if that goes well, they may even want to make an album.
All right, so, so you went to Pete's...
No, no. No.
Oh well, what do you know, there goes my identical twin sister. Just walkin' along looking like me. What, is this just like a freakish coincidence, or did you know she takes this train?
She's dead.
Joey, it's Estelle.
Oh yeah, I'm sure. And all of a sudden his hands weren't the problem anymore.
Oh, is this the bug lady?
And you know, I have a massage client soon.
Okay!
We can't leave now! There was this one baby, Haley, who was favourite to win and she got croup, so she had to stay home! This competition just blew wide open, folks!
Hi Gram. Whatcha doin'?
He is! But he's getting divorced-Ross! Maybe you know him.
Wow. Thank you.
Yes, I do! Today is Mike and my one-year anniversary.
Hey!
I can't say.
Okay, you wore me down.
Yeah that's better than my way.
Oh my god. Now I've seen everything! Whoa, she's gone. She's gone. She's gone! Go ahead, get married. Go, go.
Yeah the material feels so soft-hello Mr. Bicep! Have you been working out?
Oh no-no, no, I made a promise to myself that the next time I would talk to Ursula would be over my dead body. And that's not happening 'til October 15th, 2032.
Oh my God! I know who the father is...
I'm having my first contraction!
Okay. Would you rather live in the shirt pocket of a sweaty giant, or inside his shower drain?
No. This whole like playing-for-money thing is so not good for me. You know, I don't know, when I sang "Su-Su-Suicide", I got a dollar seventy-five. But then, "Smelly Cat", I got 25 cents and a condom. So you know, now I just feel really bad for Smelly Cat.
Ooh! No, no, no, no, he's not like a kook, no. He's just like this, this very passionate, incredibly romantic guy, that got like a tinsy bit carried away, you know. And we just get along really well, and he's so cute.
Yeah, I don't need it.
Oh my God! How did you get back here?!
Wow! They're beautiful!
Yeah, did she sound happy about it? 'Cause my friend Ethel's baby was born with a teeny, tiny beard.
I don't know! I didn't come with her!
Because I'm normal! That was the one legacy my grandmother left me, and I know you wanted it as an engagement present.
That's so sweet.
It only takes two heart attacks to finally make you see.../One of them won't do it, but the second one will set you free.../Tell all your hate and anger, it's time to say good-bye.../And that is just what I will do, soon as those bastards I work for die!/La, la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la......
It is your office.
Knock, knock, knock, knock, hi. Um, could you please tell Sergei that um, I was fascinated by what Boutros Boutros Gali said in the New York Times.
Ok, we're taking that paddle home, mister.
Okay then.
What time? Maybe we can share a cab!
Why, you don't like her?
Oh, nobody's judging you.
Wow, this is a lot!
Hi.
You wouldn't! Okay look, Rachel I know you really want to do this, but I-I've never been maid of honor to anyone before! And I know you've done it at least twice!
I'm in vice. Yeah, in fact I'm undercover right now. I'm a whore.
It's not that bad.
Secret affair!
Yeah, but not just that.
Hey!
Yeah, I did. I think it sounds y'know big sistery, y'know, 'Frank's always late.'
No, no actually, he's smiling.. and... Oh my God, don't do that!!
No..umm, could I talk to one of them? It's very very important.
Oh, just as well, I broke this one.
Oh Ross, hi.
Why?! You two are so meant to be together, everybody thinks so.
Okay, then maybe I can come too!
Yeah okay, no if it helps you okay. Yeah.
Dun-dun-duuuur! Sorry.
Nothing! I swear to God I didn't know you guys would be here! And the good news is you didn't believe in soul mates. So...
You guys, you know what I just realized? 'Joker' is 'poker' with a 'J.' Coincidence?
Okay that's even sadder. Look, I know, I know what I got myself into, it's just that now that they're in me it's like, it's like I know them y'know, I mean-I mean, it's just not gonna be easy when these little babies have to go away.
Ok, this is a typical lightning-bearer thing. Right there, it's like, um, 'Hello, who wants one of my fallic shaped man cakes?'
Get in here!!!
Ok, ok, how many of you enjoyed the music outside? Ha!
Ok, well, alright, who thinks the food is fine, the music was fine, but your evening was ruined by this incessant poll taking? .
Uh-oh. It's Scary Scientist Man.
Yeah, I'm very wise. I know.
Joey.
Not that often!
Yeah?
Oui, bien sur je parle Francais! Qu'est-ce que tu penses alors?
Well it's only like my favorite bay! {Actually, it's not bad. It just gets a little cold in winter, but in Wisconsin winter only lasts from August to June. J }
Did Rachel find you?
Look, I, y'know, I don't mind taking it slow, I like him a lot, y'know he's really interesting and he's really sweet and why won't he give it up?
Oh, I can still do that.
Oh yeah, that's right, the keyboards, huh?
Hi!
Right, like the kind you...
Yes, you're having a boy!
Ugh, okay, I have an enormous crush on you. But because you're a client, I can't ask you out, even though you give me y'know, the feeling.
It could be like a big giant guy.
Okay pepperoni, pepperoni, pepperoni, okay Ross, I know she's pretty and you love her, but is she stupid?! She forgot my vegetarian!
Wow! This place is incredible! Sting's pen...that he gave to Phoebe. Come on! Secret passageway!
Be careful, be careful! These are my rat babies!
I'm just saying, this woman, I mean she's fictitious. No?
Oh God! Is that veal?
What is that?
Yes!! Yes!! I'm the next caller! You were gonna have me hang up.
Ohh!
After that? Yeah! No, I mean if I can help.
I didn't know Playboy prints jokes.
That's odd, 'cause this dog's been living here for the past 3 days
Ok, um, hi, hello, hi, ok, so, um, this is a song about a love triangle between three people that I made up. Um, it's called, um, "Two of Them Kissed Last Night".
Sure it does. Yeah, yeah.
Of course not, because you're in love with her.
Sure you can! Give them some blocks, put them in a playpen!
Yeah, my mom sent me a family heirloom that once belonged to my grandmother. Can you believe it?! A year ago I didn't even have a family, and now I have heirlooms for crying out loud.
Hey!
So now what do we do?
Then I'm gonna have to ask you to keep it down.
What a great night, Chandler can't do it, these guys kissed...
Ooh! That's Good! Wow! But Now If You Were Pregnant, What Would You Name It? Hint Phoebe.
You have... have a girlfriend?
Hi!
How'd he take it?
Oh my God, I didn't...
Ohhh!!!
You're also so generous and kind and scrappy!
But I'm unemployed, my music is all I really have now. Well music, and making my own shoes. Pretty, huh?
Ohh, give him a kiss for me!
Oh, I was telling them about you and Emily. Y'know, try to get some sympathy.
Ooh, Madlibs, mine!
Well... but David, just... I just want you to know that... that... you know... telling you this... is one of the hardest things I've ever had to do.
Oh, poor baby.
No. I'm just, I wanna, I need to be alone.
Oh no.
Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Umm, could-could I get a copy of that? 'Cause Carol threw it out, she lost ours. She's such a scatterbrain, but man what a hot piece of ass.
No but at Monica's you can eat cookies over the sink!
Bing, what an unusual name.
Okay, it just seems pretty wild and you're so-y'know so...vanilla.
And this?
I'll miss you.
Uh-huh, I'm with Ben.
Ok.
Y'know what? I'm not talking to you! You go back to sleep! And you, are you a rapist?!
Wow, Frank. I think we just ran out of kids.
Wow! I would trade.
Yeah, because you know what, it's... it's all about the children.
You guuuyys.
Yeah!
Yeah.
Yeah!
Come on you know what to do! You hire the first one! You don't hire an assistant because they're cute, you hire them because they're qualified.
Oh! I though the pot stickers were supposed to be vegetarian!
That's okay Rachel. I'm not judging you; that's just who you are. Me. I'm more free y'know? I run like I did when I was a kid, cause that's the only way it's fun. Y'know, I mean didn't you ever run so fast you thought your legs were gonna fall off? Y'know, like when you were like running towards the swings or running away from Satan? The neighbor's dog.
I can't help you.
Whoa!! That-okay, that's a lot of pressure on me and my uterus. So, well okay, so is there-is maybe is there something that I can do y'know just to like help make sure I get pregnant?
Thanks.
I ordered Chinese food.
Umm, Gene.
No I'm having fun. I'm really-And I'm really-really excited for you and Ursula.
Noo!
If we are not doing it together, we're not doing it at all! So, say goodbye to your tickets! .
No.
It's okay. What the hell took you so long?
You are useless! Freaking out about commitment is the one thing you can do! The one thing! And you can't even do that right! God!
Oh, I'll get it.
Excuse me.
Well, if you're having a hard time, you should talk to my friends, Bill and Colleen. They adopted a kid. I'm sure they'd help you.
Yes. Did you settle the bill?
No, nothing like that. I was just...such a dummie. I taught this "massage-yourself-at-home-workshop." And they are.
Ewww! Oh! It's the Mattress King!
I know.
Y'know what, forget it. It's ruined.
Well, it felt French.
Hey, y'know what? My Grandma had the exact same bag!
Stop it! Stop it! She keeps squirming, trying to get away! Just like when she was alive.
Hey.
Hey, you guys. Listen, I'm sorry that I was hogging the game before--Oh my God! Your friends have some unfortunate initials!
This is completely normal, around the fourth month your hormones start going crazy.
And this is Rachel.
It's Lafite. The '74 Latour is actually drinking quite nicely.
Yes. Once. Yeah, a little. He kinda did it to himself. It's not really a good story.
I don't. He got...he-he-he-he's hit by a bus.
What is that?
You'll have a last kiss.
Well then you'd better hurry! The Angelica! Go! Go!
You are just nonstop!
Okay. Oh! Oh no.
Swear?!
Rachel has something that she wants to tell you and umm, I believe that this is your red sweater.
Okay, great so do you want to do it together?
Fine. Okay, enjoy your concert.
Yeah, um, she was 82 years old. Her name was um, Mrs. Adelman.
Ohhh.
About what?
Why don't take care of this one, and should I get pregnant again, I'll hold onto your card, okay?
Y'know what you should send him? A cartoon of cigarettes. 'Cause that why he could trade it for protection. No. That's prison.
He said, "Nice to meet you Glenda." Well, obviously I couldn't give him my real name?
So you like the drums! That's, that's great! Y'know, I was worried, that, you know, they would maybe an unbearable living situation. All right, okay, well, apparently not! So, yay!
OK, Monica? I had another answer all ready.
Well-But-Now, if-if you can achieve positronic distillation of sub-atomic particles y'know before he does, then he can come back.
Oh my God! Monica's gonna totally freak out!
Okay. All right, this is my favourite part of the weekend, right now, this.
Oh, I thought this was your party and it turns out it's a party for Howard. He's just the sweetest little man!
No, no, no, oh no-no-no, it's has to be 800. 'Cause all those big companies have 800 numbers, every one. Yeah, every big Utah-based company has one.
Chandler?
I'm sorry, I-I-I-I don't live here anymore. I-I didn't know how to tell you, but y'know everybody else knows!
Right.
Oh, honey, honey, tell them the story about your patient who thinks things are, like, other things. Y'know? Like, the phone rings and she takes a shower.
Hey!
Oh, hey, look, I found coffee! Okay, let's skedaddle.
Oh, this is it. This what's gonna kill me.
Whatever! What about you Meg?
Does that mean Carcass is available?
Oh absolutely yeah! Oh and keep in mind, now, I was carrying triplets so in, y'know, medical terms I was-I was thrice as randy.
I didn't say anything yet!
That is funny.
A birthday party.
Wow! Oh my God, well if they've ripped off our table ours must be much more than one and fifty dollars!
Come, sit. Sit. Sit! Umm, all righty, before we get started I just-I need you to state for the official record that you are in fact Frank Buffay.
Mon... Marcia and Chester are planning on seeing a movie on Sunday night. Marcia thinks they're supposed to meet at six, Chester thinks it's at seven.
I'm just saying hi! Now I'm gonna go!
Now, are you sure you don't want to go see a doctor?
Okay, so umm, somebody has to call Frank and Alice. And then my mom wants to know--Joey, what are you doing?!
I'm still on "no."
Oh no, yeah.
I sleep with him!
Oh! I won't say, 'no' to a movie!
Hey.
I think it went into me.
Oh!
Well hello, Mrs. Penella! Thank you so much for coming! Well, okay look, here's your umm, 3-D glasses and Reverend Pong will tell you when to put them on.
Like a date type person?
Mmmmmm! Everything smells so delicious! You know, I can't remember a time I smelt such a delicious combination of of, OK, smells.
Yes.
Hello, Hello. Ohh, OHH, she knew I could kick her ass.
Wait-wait-wait-wait! So, explain something to me though, if, if nobody tagged Rachel, then isn't the play still going.
Well, you could wait 'til I go to the dentist, maybe I'll kill him.
No it's just that I got this new pager and I have it on vibrate. See ya!
Oh no, the dog's not going to be there!
Are you asking me to have a frenaissance?
I don't know, it's such a long trip.
Its fine. I mean, this is something that you've been thinking about since you were what, 14?
I have quarters!
Oh.
Aw. I'm just-I'm in a place in my life right now where I...I...
Good God man don't anger it.
I just went to my old apartment to get you the-the cookie recipe and the stupid fire burned it up!
Where are you going?
Joseph! Thou needn't worry, they shan't be long.
I would love it. Consider it forgotten... But just so you know... however and whenever you decide to propose, I promise I'll say yes. Whether... whether, you know, it is in a basketball game, or in sky writing, or you know, like some lame guy in a cheesy movie who hides it in the cake.
All right, fine, fine, but if you're my next victim, don't come back as a poltergeist and like suck me into the TV set.
Uh-huh, yeah that's too bad. I really want to go to his concert Friday night, but it's totally sold out. I know! Why don't you meet him and get tickets?! If you get two I'll take you.
All right. No, no, no, not a Richard thing, just put down the glass. And get out!
Hey Ross!
Ok, I didn't see it, because I was putting on my jacket, but I uh want to believe you.
What?
Because she exchanges every gift she ever gets, it's like impossible to get her something she likes. Come on, let's trade!
There's a reset button?! Ugh, thank you! Thank you! There's a reset button! My God! Why didn't I see that! Reset button, reset button, where is there a reset button? Oh here it is! Oh! Ohh, God!
I just wish they'd realise they should be together.
Oh, it's not!
What is it?
Well, so, umm, anyway umm, I've been, I've been looking for my Father, and umm, have you heard from him, or seen him?
What, he's not still following her. Do you think he is still following her?
Hey!
No, no, it's not your fault. You know it's partly my fault, 'cause I made you quit cold turkey. Sorry, no. Okay, well, I mean, I can't date you anymore, 'cause your, you know Wow! But um, but I will definitely, definitely help you get over my sister. Okay, stalk me for a while. Huh? Yeah, and, and, and, I'll be like an Ursula patch.
Wait, wait, I'm getting a deja vu...no, I'm not.
Ok, ok, ok. Ooh, hey 'new doc on the block, Days of Our Lives' Joey Tribbiani.' Ooh, cool picture.
Ross, if you're this upset, you should go and talk to her.
I beg to differ .
Alright Monica, if there is something that you would like to share...
Someday.
Oh.
Hey!
But at least the apothecary table is real.
You've have lipstick right here . That's okay, it's mine, we just kissed.
I'm sorry, Monica, I'm really happy you got promoted, but cold cucumber mush for thirty-something bucks? No! Rachel just had that, that, that salad, and, and Joey with his like teeny pizza! It's just...
You guys!! Come on!
What else do they add smell too?
No! Seven rats! I think we should take them home, we need feed them.
Hey!
Sven I don't understand what you're saying! What is wrong with the flowers? Lorkins? What the hell are lorkins?
Okay!
Y'know? Ooh, you can almost smell the opium.
Rachel?
'Cause my, my grandmother's never had chicken pox. Please, please tell me you have, 'cause oh my God, I forgot how cute you are.
Why are you looking at me like that?
No, I really wanna live with you! I wanna move in with you!
You ask an intriguing question Chandler Bing.
Hey!
Oh really?
No-no, it's okay. But are we sure we don't want the waterbed?
Ohh-oh, chilling!
Hey!
OK, fine, if it means that much to you I'll get rid of Bob.
Well it's just like you're trying too hard. Always making jokes, y'know, you just-You come off a little needy.
yea you know you are a bit of a drama queen.
Well, she told me that I'm gonna die this week, so I'm kinda bummed about that.
Oh, no! I- I can't drink this now!
Okay, I'll do it, but just these three, right
Me too! Monica, do you think we could do it?
Is it a meatball sub?
All righty. I'll be back in-in a little bit. Unless you wanna come with me?
Yeah, I know because you have all the good words. What do I get? I get "it's," "and" oh I'm sorry, I have "A." Forget it.
Okay, well maybe not on those levels.
Ooh, Joey, that's actually a really good idea!
Woo-yay!!
Okay, let's go running!
And you hate fish. Oh. That's so sweet, alright. Ok, alright, you can see. This is me... Oh, I am scary.
What?! You can't separate them! That's terrible. Which one?
I know! Evil! And... and... and... I like Mike so much, you know. It's just going really well. Oh my God!
Ewwww!!
Yeah, it's in the guys' apartment under the sink. Why?
Um, yeah I guess that's me.
Really? There's nothing sexual about this? Oooh. Oo God! Ohh. Ohhhh. Ohh. What are you looking at?! I mean hi.
I'm having another heart attack!! Call 9-1-1!!
Yes, 'cause now I have to go down there, and deal with them.
Soul mate.
Okay.
Get out of here you lurker! Go on! Get!
Yeah, what's your point?
Well not exactly like the one in the poem.
Well, if you think it will help.
I'll have to get back to you on that. Okay, bye! Oh my God! He wants me to come over and feel his bicep and more!
...so this guy was all And I'm all, Buffay, Homicide. It was just so cool!
Hey! Check it out! This is unbelievable! Joey has been holding his breath for almost four minutes!
Oh my God!
Oh good! Then you're in luck! Ben's not my son!
Yay! I love drunk Monica!
You saved them! You guys! Oh God, you're the best!
Wait for me! Wait for me! Wait for me! Oh cool, this is my first huddle.
You wanna try it again?
What am I gonna do?! What am I gonna do?! I can't call my office they'll kill me! I can't call my clients they'll kill themselves! Great, now my chest hearts.
Let's run towards them!
Let's see. Oh my God! Oh... But no! No! You can't-you can't hire him, because that-it's not professional. Umm, this is for me yes? Thanks.
Umm, she said she'd be back December 26th.
Okay.
Well, didn't you just hear what I said?!
I don't want it to end either.
Yeah... ooh... wow... Even started to think I'd never meet someone that, you know, I wanted to... do this with. Here you go.
oh, well, Ross probably has it, you can get it from him later.
Oh, look what we almost left.
Hey.
Oh, you say someone's name enough, they turn around.
Umm, cups.
Yeah! And until then you are going to sing to me because the radio's broken and you are selfish but have a nice voice.
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. If you... If you want your key back, I totally understand.
Oh.
Well, I made you a candle light dinner in the park.
Oh, try and stop me!
Well, y'know I may have relatives in France who would know. My grandmother said she got the recipe from her grandmother, Nesele Tolouse.
What? You'll hi-ya?
And all of the sudden his hands weren't the problem anymore.
Yeah, bye.
Oh, great! We couldn't keep our eyes off each other all night and then every once and a while y'know, he'd kinda lean over and stroke my hair and touch my neck.
Yes!
Good for you!
Yeah. But Sergei said it took the Germans six weeks to get all the way across it.
What?
Wait!! Where are you going?! What are you doing?! No!! Wait!! God!! Why am I always pregnant when she does that?!
That's right, exactly. All right, it's a good bye kiss, that's good. Bye-bye. Okay, no, the important thing is that you see what I'm saying, y'know, just y'know, this is clearly wrong. Okay, I've decided I'm gonna let this happen! Okay, can I just get my purse? Okay, all right, good. .
Hi!
No.
Enchante.
Oh, which museum?
My grandmother has this new boyfriend, and they're both kind of insecure in bed. Oh, and deaf. So they're constantly, like, having to reassure each other that they're having a good time. You have no idea how loud they are!
Well, that's what I said, but it turns out, Mike was planning on proposing to me that same way last night!
It's a cotton swab with a bit of my saliva on it, so that if they perfect the cloning process while you are over there, you can use the DNA to create your own Pheebs!
You know, I think I want to write a song about all this.
You're all invited to bite me!
Hey!
Yeah, I do. What's the matter?
Okay, I'm gonna go get Frank.
Bye Chandler.
: It wasn't just that she was fat, the woman smelled like garbage! Everyone! It wasn't just that she was fat the woman smelled like garbaaaaaage! Classy, uh?
Oh, okay, I'm having another one! This one doesn't hurt either-Ooh, yes it does! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ooh! Oh, I was kinda hoping that was it.
Okay. And, my, dead, mother, says, you, are, it. I'm with Rachel.
Which-which sister is this? Is this the spoiled one or that's bitter?
Wow! It's huge! It's so much bigger than the cubicle. Oh, this is a cube.
Oh wait, oh no. Wait.
Oh hi!
Ohh! I did not get that.
But she just came up here!
I love you too. Please don't... Don't turn into... you know... French bitch!
No wonder your pregnant.
That doesn't lock does it?
Oh, there they are!
No don't tear out your eyes!!
Marcia and Chester are mad at Phyllis.
But no, because a doctor won't be able to help him, it's just gonna y'know naturally pass through his system in like seven years.
Mrs. Waltham. Hi. It's Phoebe again.
I can't believe you won't just admit it! Okay, just promise me that you won't do anything stupid.
Okay, I got a good one. Okay, umm, what is she? Like 12?
I can't say because he's famous.
Sparkly. So, wow, this is pretty wonerful, huh. Mr. major capades guy. I, I remember when you were just, like, King Friday in Mr. Roger's Ice is Nice.
Okay.
I do too.
No, but would you like a thousand dollars and a football phone?
I hope you were using protection.
No, not wieght... y'know, more like insulation.
No, I'm fine.
Ok so will he be back soon?
That's a bird!
Oh that'd be me. Sir. After you.
Is something wrong?
Embryossss? As in, "More than one?"
Yeah, her first day on a new spiritual plane and she's gonna come to the coffeehouse!
Ohh, okay, they gave you the old time pricing.
Oh, I'm Phoebe Buffay. I'm one of Ross's best friends.
What?!
I'm sorry, it's just, I'm a little short on cash.
Okay, maybe it was a trick question. Um, Rachel can we do this now?
Oh! I'm a masseuse. I give people massages and stuff.
Good for you!
Well, it's a long story. It's kind of embarrassing. Let's just say there was a typographical error with a sex manual. How about you?
Oh OK. So, um, the cat stinks but you love it, let's go.
Why, do I have a feeling that's not as happy as it sounds? No! Nooooo!!!
Oh, god. So adorable. Look at them sleeping there like angels.
Hey! Hi!
Fine.
Yes. We're here to make a rather sizeable donation to the children.
So, did shopping make you feel any better about Ross?
Ok, do you know how to go from D to A minor?
Okay, bye!
Oh! Ooh! Oh, I didn't know that you did...pot.
Yeah, you like that don't you?
Hi!
Oh, now you're sad and creepy, oh. You know what, I, I'm sorry I quit, okay, I just quit.
No offense, but that sounds nothing like her.
ok.
It's so weird seeing Ross and Rachel with a baby. It's just so grown up.
Well, the interview...
Okay, this is from your friend at work.
You're just saying that because you're my biggest fan. Joey listen, take good care of that guy, okay? He's a fan. Bye!
Fine! Be murky!
Better. Yeah.
Okay! All right, let's start with the handshake. Hi.
Okay, yeah. Triple A can pick us up.
Um, that's really your decision, I mean, some people prefer, you know, to take off...oh whoops! You're being naked!
Well I don't, I don't have a mother so often I forget that other people...
You didn't read this one either?!
You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it kinda looks like an old potato.
I didn't watch the ending, I was too depressed. It just kept getting worse and worse, it should have been called, "It's a sucky life and just when you think it can't suck any more it does."
Tell him it's for you.
Yeah? Well this is not what I ordered.
Okay.
Well you don't.
Ooh, hey, could we put on the news? I think it might be raining.
I just lost a whole year of my life.
Sure. Do you need some floss?
It's alright. Look kiddo, I gotta go. Good luck with the career. You're gonna be huge.
No-no, oh, I'm fine with the age thing y'know, until it starts sticking it's tongue down my little brother's throat!
Can you believe this. In, like, two hours I'm gonna have a dad. Eeeshk.
No! No, her cab! She probably won't be using it; you can drive it to Las Vegas.
Okay, bye. Alright, so Mike's on his way over. See, you thought you guys were meeting here, and he thought you were meeting at the restaurant, so you know... Doesn't really matter who's right or wrong. Point is... I'm gonna take off.
Hey!
Um, not even a little bit.
Monica! That's not right! Start with where.
Hi! Oh, yeah, no, I know. You're a chef. I know, and I thought of you first, but um, Chandler's the one who needs a job right now, so....
Who's day just got better? CHANDLER!
Okay.
Oh, ok, um, I mean Frank senior.
Ok.
Wow! Talking about high maintenance.
I will replace it, I promise. I feel so terrible.
It's a video of my friend giving birth. Could you just bring it back to your apartment?
Oh? Hello you.
Oh, no, I meant that it's weird that you only have nine now.
Well, it was really sweet, and like the most romantic thing ever.
All right. If you care enough to make up that load of crap, okay.
Yes, it was.
Which proves that I never lie.
Wow! Could everyone totally see up his robe?
So you're a gladiator! Wow!
It's Ross.
All right. Did everyone get out okay?
Why, I must have been in missile training the day they taught that.
Yeah, kinda.
OK, I wasn't in love with him and I was just helping out a friend.
Hey, look who's up! How do you feel?
Sure, yeah. I mean, it's Joey. I don't want him to get hurt. Well, I must say, I am on fire! First Chandler, now Joey!
Oh, hey Joey.
Oh! I knew it! I knew it! I felt really thick this morning.
I'm guessing she does.
Okay, don't give me a reason to get mad, okay
You knew this and you never said anything?! With all the stupid dinosaur stuff you tell us?!
Nothing! This is not over!
Oh.
Okay.
Oh, oh sweet Lord! This is what evil must taste like!
Mandy.
I love the license plate game!
I'm in.
Joey's having a party and he wasn't gonna invite us?
Ross, how about you. What would you give up, sex or food?
Okay, Jasmine, can you, can you ask Mr. Whiffler if he can wait for like five minutes.
Ooh, ok, that's it. Enough with the keys. No one say keys.
That is so sweet, you guys.
Oh, I thought you weren't coming. What? Where were you?
Ohh! We went to a self-defense class today!
Hi.
Goodnight.
Yeah, it's beautiful.
Oh, I don't know, I don't know. I think that's a little weird, y'know? Vinyl.
Butterscotch? No one? All right, you'll be sorry later.
"Are you in there little fetus? In nine will you come great us? I will buy you some Adidas."
No, 'cause she didn't tell me I was gonna die until the very end of the session, and I was not gonna waste a whole another hour there! I mean I've only got a week left, y'know? I've really gotta start living now! , leans back, and starts reading.)
Ooh, you guys have to make a wish.
But why?!
Ok, this is the most romantic disease I've ever had.
Tiger! Dragon! Iceberg!! Joseph, did you even study at all last night?
Alright, now I will let go if you both stop.
Oh, look, twins. Hi, guys. Oh, cute, cute.
Look at all the stuff people sent!
Yeah I get that.
Yeah. What?!
So how did you know Francis?
Hey!
Watch, watch.
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
Are you under the sheet?
Wait a second! This is about the fourth month of your pregnancy, right?
Fine. The reason that I was leaning a little bit more toward Rachel than you is just that you're ... just ... kinda high maintenance-Okay let's go to lunch!
Hey Mike, what's the capital of Peru?
But... I'm ready, so, just deal.
Monica, how did this happen? I thought you had this all planned out.
Oh yeah, so you can walk around naked.
Umm, I lost one of your earrings. I'm sorry! I am so, so sorry!
I can be a waitress. OK watch this. Um, gimme two number ones, 86 the bacon, one Adam and Eve on a raft and rick'em, la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la.
Yeah, I should have told you.
so you don't think I'm a total freak.
Hey.
Because it was fate that made me call you today!
It's not kicking me, it's kicking one of the other babies. Oh ! Don't make me come in there!
Yes that's right. But still, I-, look at your purse, look at your sweater, look at yourselves.
I want to see what he wants first.
Hi.
I don't know.
Okay, your highness.
No!
Wow!
Ooh-ohh!
Okay, what did we say was your one gift to us?
No that's not true. If you're not moving forward, you're just staying still. And staying still is good. Watch this.
No-no, I know that, but I just have to make enough money for the second part of my plan.
Isn't it funny how we kept running into each other? It's as if someone really wants us to be together.
Wow!
So did you ask him?
Okay.
What?!
I thought I'd try to take a walk. Would you pour me some water? I'll be back soon.
Okay, I will find someplace else to do the rest of my appointments. I just don't know what the big deal is!
Well, I think it's great that the medical community is finally trying to help sick hamsters.
Hey, oh, so, um...how'd you make out last night?
Um-um, um-um.
No, I mean you break up with Janice and I'll break up with Tony.
I've got friends too. Okay, bye.
Thanks!
I don't know what to do with that.
Well... Yeah. You look great too. Did you get a haircut?
Yeah.
Not that way! But the bike brought you a lot closer!
I did!
You are really good! I play a little guitar myself.
I know it's kind of weird, but I mean, she was a big part of my life there, you know, and now I just feel kind of alone.
That's weird. I bet they're doing it.
Hey look, you guys, it's snowing!
Sells drugs to kids.
Well, you know what Chandler? I think you've gotta face it. You're like, the guy in the big office, you know. You're the one that hires them, that fires them... They still say you're a great boss.
I know.
Am I? Really? Am I? Well, why don't you cook Thanksgiving dinner and prove me wrong! Well, think about it, think about it, you'll be trying to top than you did last year. You'd be in competition... with yourself.
Now Ben, sometimes people may seem like jerks on the outside, but they have famous fathers.
Oh this, well I'm glad you asked. Now, don't you hate it when you have to cut a tin can with an ordinary steak knife? Ahh! Now, I know what you're thinking...
Oh! Ooh! Umm!
No! There-there was a little, a little diff in the market and I lost 13 million dollars.
Gooood luck! Gooood luck! We all wish you good luuuuuuuuck!!!
No. You're not, you're not stupid.
They're gonna get through this, aren't they?
Wow, it's like a dirty math problem.
You don't have to be back for a half-hour!
Oh my God!!
Wow! This reminds me of the time when I was umm, living on the street and this guy offered to buy me food if I slept with him.
Your knuckles are kinda hairy too...
Hey, oh, you know that guy who's been following me? I talked to him today.
Oh good, you're all up.
I'm sorry, I can't believe I set you up with such a MONSTER!
Hey, how are you guys doing?
No-no, I got that.
It's slang for pregnant.
What?! What-what-what-what-what?!!
I'm sorry, I'm late.
Hey. Ooh! Don't sit down!
Hello.
We're back!
Trouble?
No! No! Look at that! It's a line of ants! They're working as a team!
Oh, he needed some time to grieve.
Well, I, I like the idea of naming him after someone I love, and Joey and Chandler are great names. But, all right, I don't-maybe I'll just name him The Hulk.
Ooh.
Oh right, yeah okay, my Mom could, and I can't. We don't have that....
Thank y...
Uh-huh, great story! I'm going!
Oh! Oh! Oh no!! You swore!
I got them!
Well, this is none of my business.
Who dies?
You know he's gay?
Wow, Joey and a professor! Can you imagine if they had kids and if the kids got her intelligence and Joey's raw sexual magnetism... Oh, those nerds will get laaaaaid!
Okay. Hey-Ooh, cool sheets!
No. I'm-I'm to depressed to talk.
Well, what did he do?
Okay, then what happened?
ME TOO! I NEVER THOUGHT I COULD LOVE SOMEONE THIS MUCH!
Well, if you don't want your mother to move in with you, just tell her.
Of course not! And you're gonna love Mary Ellen. She's really smart and cute and funny, and I can't tell you how I know this, but she' not opposed to threesomes. So tell me some about my guy.
Cut her out of our lives! Just ignore her calls and dodge her 'till she gets the point!
Yes. Yes. Yes. I can't believe it! The baby wants bologna! Maybe he wants me to eat meat? I can't eat meat!
Well yeah, I lied before.
That wouldn't stand in the way of a true pianist.
And we did.
What's the matter with me? How do I keep ruining this? I'm sorry, I'm sorry!
Yeah, okay.
You're gonna get pregnant.
Look kibbles, bits. Oh God, alright, get the hell off my leg you yippity piece of crap. Ok, alright, we have a problem.
Uh-huh!
Oh! Well, what kind of emergency that gets us both out of here?
Oh I got it!! Oh! Ew! Broken boob! Ow!
So bad.
That's what I said.
Oh, they see us! Oh, they, they look mad. Oh, they figured it out. They're coming this way. Run!
Yeah Im fine.
Are you leaving "The Supremes"?
RACHEL!!
Okay.
Oh right, maybe I'll just go home.
Nah. I kept myself busy.
I can and I will!
: Oh I see, so then, you were lying.
Okay, thank you very much, I'm gonna take a short break!
Oh, it's so pretty. This must have cost him a fortune.
I surely do!
Roll playing... You could be the warden; she could be the prisoner. You could be the pirate; she could be the wench!
No. No! Yes! Ahh. Oh, would you look at that Monica? I just knocked off all of your top scores, how sad.
How'd you know I was coming?
Fun Bobby is so great.
All right, that's it, I quit.
Yeah, in the back. You want a quarter?
Paul.
Yeah, we'll talk at dinner.
You are just like Jack.
Okay. Oooh! Oh, this is our last huddle, yeah.
What?
You know, it's fine. We'll pay you.
Anyway, I just wanted to say thank you, it was just, it was so sweet.
Ow! My ass. Okay. Okay. Oh, shhh!
Maybe that's 'cause she's not really gone.
Yeah, okay, listen, umm, Mom, I hope you know you still mean a lot to me. And you're welcome to come back anytime.
Yeah, but there's a two-year wait. And then what if you get engaged in two years and then you got to wait another two years for this place. That's four years. Chandler's not gonna wait that long. He's gonna find somebody else, y'know? Someone, someone who did put their name on the list.
Grandma's gonna have to get in line.
Oh, somewhere Joey's head is exploding.
Yeah, after this, I think he'll be doing that himself.
Oh, yeah, it's my mom's.
You won't let go?
Get your garlic-peelers off me!
Yeah.
Yes, doctor.
Hi, so what happened?
All right, I'm gonna go take a pregnancy test, right now.
Yay, okay!
That you don't stop talking about it.
Hm huh, yeah.
Because this one is now! And-and it's two of our best friends! Who knows what you're gonna marry!
I'm trying, but man that guy can push my buttons!
I'm sorry, but I just wrote the best dance song for your wedding. Check this out.
Oh wait, I change my mind! Okay, let's talk about the party! I have so many ideas!
Remembered what?
I'm not gonna. But you know what's cool though? Ok, if you had a friend named Pete, then I could say, 'Oh yeah, I know Pete, he's friends with my brother.'
Oh, God bless us, everyone.
Yeah! Let's do that!! That-that sounds good. We should sit down and talk, just me, my lover Carol, and the Stings. Umm, how-how will I get in touch with them?
Okay. Umm look, you're coming on a little strong. But I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt, because it seems the universe really wants to be together. So, why don't we just start over okay? And you can just tell me about yourself.
I wanna hear "The Sound."
I love you. But I never needed a proposal from you. I just needed to know that we were headed somewhere, you know, that we had a future.
Then change it back!
Yeah? I know! I know! Uh huh? Listen why don't we just um, sit and relax? You know just be with each other. Quietly!
Yeah, I know, it's gonna be even worse for you... God... Ross, get ready to do some serious crying.
Oh I know, I helped pick out the ring.
Suzie?
Musty!
Ooh! How about Agamemnon?
Oh, I was just here looking for, um, my um, my part of an old sandwich. Oh, here it is! Oh.
OK, I smell smoke. Maybe that's 'cause someone's pants are on fire.
Oh!
Ok, well, are all the tickets in the bowl?
No, answer his.
Ok, don't get me started on gravity.
You told me.
Maybe it's something you ate?
Oh, I-I gave them the puppy and it made them so happy that I decided I'm gonna carry their baby.
Count for what?
Two.
I, I don't know what to say. I mean, you know, you're married to someone for six years and you think you know him and then one day says, 'Oh, I'm not gay.'
Yeah, you can't do that! Oh, come on Mike, strap on a pair.Why don't you just tell her that we got back together. You know, women appreciate honesty. We also appreciate gentle spanking once in a while. Just F.Y.I.
Or instead, maybe you could just not marry my brother Frank.
Well, I'm no longer Phoebe Buffay.
Ohh, you guys, remember that cute client I told you about? I bit him.
Yeah a little. He seems really nice. Good kisser.
I can do that.
Ahh, toilet seat covers! Is that what you were doing while I was getting gas?
Wow! Okay, dude alert! And who is this guy?
Save it Red! Unless you wanna spend the night in the slammer, you apologize to the tree.
No, but he's always late.
No. This is what I do for luck, ok.
No, you?
Hi! Sorry, I'm late.
Just a sec., we're kind in the middle of something here.
Where?
Hello. This is Phoebe Buffay. I was wondering, please, if-if it's not too much trouble, please, umm, might I speak to Miss Emily Waltham, please?
Oh, I have cards!
Rachel has a new doll.
Oh, I am sorry but I am incredibly talented.
Look, why don't you just pay for it yourself?
Hey Rach, what time do you get off? We're all gonna do something tonight.
That's short for Phoebe?! I thought that was just what we called each other!
Oooh, is daddy getting angry? Is daddy gonna spank me?
Wow, that's close. When's yours?
Oh, was I doing it again?
Look, Ross, in this box are all the things I got from mugging that I thought were too special to sell... or smoke. Anyway, I was looking through it and I found "Science Boy"
But...
What? Oh my God!
All right.
Oh! Oh my God!
No. Neither is mine.
Yeah?
Or, we could not tell them we know and have a little fun of our own.
No, no, we don't really have time for this right now. Okay, we have to keep Chandler away from my bedroom.
Uh-huh. Okay. Okay, don't you think, maybe, though, it's just that he's so perceptive that it freaks you out?
No, I think you should tell them.
I did it! One mile on a hippity-hop! That's it!! That's everything I wanted to do before I was thirty. Oh, except I wanted to patch things up with my sister. But oh well. Yay!! And-and girls this thing is a Godsend if you know what I mean.
But if...
Yeah!
That's like the pervert motto! Yeah! Yeah! They have you raise your right hand, put your left hand down your pants, and repeat that!
Umm, this stuffing is amazing. Do you think we should bring them some?
Oh no, I want to.
...Then I've already seen this one!
I sound amazing. I, I, I've never heard myself sing before. I mean, except in my own head. Oh, this is so cool, now I can hear what you hear.
You're not going?
You don't see it? You actually don't see it?
Really?
Wooo!! Hoo!!
Yeah.
Didn't it like totally speak to you?
So, um, have you told your parents?
All right, no, well I want to kill them to, but their boys, y'know how are we gonna beat three boys?
Yeah, I already have my bell and later on...I get my bucket.
Okay. There may be a way that we can get the other ring back. 'Cause I heard the guy tell the jeweler where he was going to propose. So maybe we can get him to trade rings or something.
Okay umm, I'd also like to try on the tiara. Oh yeah. Okay. What do you think, too much?
Theodore... Bitsy... What a delight!
Really, it doesn't mean anything. I mean, you know, Monica refers to Chandler as Richard all the time!
Umm, when I get married will you be my maid of honor?
On the touchy.
Well I guess it's okay to open one more if it's part of a set. Y'know, it's probably this one.
Hey.
You didn't say Boutros Boutros Gali.
No, I'm really okay with this. Y'know why? 'Cause look at them, and I made that, so... I know it's gonna be like a million times harder to give up a baby but, oh my God, it's gonna feel like a million times better, right? I wanna do this. I wanna carry your baby.
Okey-doke.
Ooh, what a great table! Where-where did you get it?
Oh no. Could I get anyone a coffee or...poison? No? Just for me? Okay.
What-what's up?
I know her! I bought homemade soap from her at a Dead show!
Yeah, I... Well y'know I-I mean I missed the-the semi-finals, so I'd just be lost.
Hey!
Ohh!
Excuse me, I don't want Greg and Jenny's rejects.
Oh, just think... she's gonna be watching that video on a TV that hasn't even been invented yet! With friends who right now are just like babies! And they'll be living in a floating city that the humans built to escape the ant people!
Well, we don't n-n-n-n-need a fireman, we'd, we'd like a good mechanic. Oh my God, here they come! Well, we gotta get out of here!
Ahhh!! Chandler and Monica!! Chandler and Monica!!
Oh, yeah, um-mm. Oh!
Do you want me to teach you? I'm a great teacher.
No! But it's the nicest kitchen, the refrigerator told me to have a great day.
Wait-wait-wait! Wait!!
What happened?
Ohh! I have! I have! I started making these little sock bunnies! Oh for crying out loud!
Do I? Thank you, so do you.
Oh, you won't believe who moved back to town.
Ooh, it's not a toy.
Hmm, bummer.
Hey! Ooh, how was your first day working at the restaurant?
I've had that dog there for three days and Chandler had no idea. He's not so smart.
Oh, you, too.
Oh, okay, oh.
Don't come any closer!
Yes, good! Ok...
Hey! Maybe you'll die!
I don't....
Phoebe-Phoebe-Phoebe-Phoebe-Burrrrr!
Rachel is one of my closest friends. Although, being the only one who knows anything about this does makes me feel special. Okay!
What are the chances? 1 billion Chinese people and they send Mike!?
Rachel.
Oh, okay I didn't get that message. So this doesn't count-Anyway, I'll be in my office.
Yeah?
Oh! Hello? Yeah this is Phoebe. Really?!
You know who shaved you? That was me.
You should have thought of that before you got in!
Because it's my apartment!
I worked in a Dairy Queen, why?
Ooh, God, it's him! It's that cop! God, I can't believe it! He found me!
Ok Mike, better come back Mike, better come back.
Right. My name was on there, but now it just says "carrot cake". So, um, so um, how many chords do you know?
There you go. Okay, do you think you're gonna be okay?
Well not clients, lovers. But let's just y'know, try it again. Come back and-and we'll work through it.
Damn you Monica Geller hyphen Bing!
Umm, it's negative.
Oh, it's my wedding planner. She's driving me crazy! Hello... Hey, ok, stop screaming! Ok? So, halibut. All right, so salmon, either way. I don't-I don't... it doesn't matter to me!
How could you pick up a hitchhiker?! He could be a rape-, a rapist or a killer or something!
OK, so what, you're just never gonna see him again?
Oh, I Got Tired Of Naming States. So I Decided To List The Types Of Celery, And I Have One regular celery.
All right, I'd better go too. I have to go talk to my dad.
No, no, no, no, no, no. Yeah, could I just?
I... I cannot believe Ross even made this list. What a dinkus.
So is Joey going to have to give up the apartment?
Yeah? Why?
Noo! But that would've been so cool!
Your welcome, oh please not the one with the turtles.
Well, he didn't tell me.
Oh, you're such a cheater!
Hey!
Well you said that he's paying the people who are playing.
Good. It's just so hard, it's hard for me to ... let them go. I guess it just brings back memories, you know, from ... when I gave birth to my brother's triplets and I had to give them up. I haven't told you about that yet, have I?
Hello?
You got it!
Ok, right there. That, that's the third sign today. Right there.
That's right, I don't... But I was, I was drunk on you!
All right, well, I just can't think about that right now. I just wanna say good-bye to my Grandma.
Uh-huh!
It's not cooler.
OK. Um, how come I'm walking with you?
Oh my God, that's so freaky! Turn him off!!
Uh huh yeah there's just something umm, there's something you should know Vicrum just called.
...and I-I can't take it! Y'know? I'm just, always afraid one of them is gonna catch me with the other one. It's making me crazy.
Oh, Ja! Ja!
Yes, please.
There is a speakerphone on the base unit...
Yes! They called and you didn't get it! Okay, I mean you didn't get it, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Hey!
Yeah.
Oh right, like they're gonna let me have a passport.
How's this?
Where'd you get too? We lost you after you opened up all the presents.
There he is!
Yeah, I agree. Ya know, I think fancy parties are only fun if you're fancy on the inside and I'm just not sure we are.
All better! Back to work! Except this clown from research told me I was fired. He should do his research, huh?
Trick or treat!
Hey. I'll be right back. I've got to go to the bathroom.
Okay, what is this? A stupid contest? Because we got a winner here!
Ohh, you are so lucky! Hey! So, where's Monica? Did you guys make up?
Yeah.
Drum roll.
Okay, that helps.
Okay.
What do you mean, comforted her?
Yeah!
Oh, yeah, sure. So, how was your day?
Get out of the cab!
Well, same thing we did all day, hang out at Gary's apartment. He is so amazing, we never left the bedroom. But have fun at the movie.
That was my dad!
Oh, wait, wait!
Tell me about it.
Ooh, I have to tell you something.
This is going to be so much fun! Okay-shhh, I have to finish.
Oh, that's Sarah. No, no. Don't you get any ideas, ok? No, I'm not setting you up with any more of my friends!
Sit down.
Okay, cancel backup! Cancel backup!
Although... it's also about the wedding... Ugh, alright... here. No... Oh God... Oh!
Perhaps because you gave her an engagement ring? Y'know Ross doctors are supposed to be smart.
No, we hate that.
Oh my God! That's the creep that you're with at the Statue of Liberty.
What?!
Hey!
No, I can't talk to you! I don't have a fancy ad in the Yellow Pages!
Ok. Listen, just don't say anything about me, ok.
Shhh! I'm talking.
It's James Bond.
Rachel Karen Green, where's the other earring?!
What?
Oh hey, Monica, I heard you saw Donald Trump at your convention.
Helloo! Oh!
Oh!
Oh my God.
Ok, say no more.
Yeah, you mean like that you're kind of a loner.
Why not her?
Oh you don't know.
But umm, I mean, did you talk to them about, y'know...
Yeah, I can't say that. uhm... Susie, I'm gonna be straight with you... Mike and I are back together... and uhm... unfortunately that effectively ends your relationship with him. And he's very sorry about that and wishes you the best of luck in all your endeavours.
You were great. But they still made fun of you.
And y'know, even if they break up again, you'd better not let him in your sad men's club!
Oh God.
But-but you know you cannot get involved with your assistant.
Yes!
Excuse me, Ross, old friends catching up.
Okay. Hey Rach?
Mate? They're all brothers and sisters.
But Joey, you're gonna be fine. You don't need that show, it was just a dumb soap opera.
Hey. So, did you talk to Rachel?
I can't. I can't. She dumped me, I mean I totally trusted her and then one day it was 'Okay, bye Pheebs' gone. Y'know what the saddest part is, when we were playing together, that was like the most fun I've ever had in like all my lives.
Oh! You got it?!
Hey!
YOU KNOW?!!!
Look, I'm talking right now! You're-you mean her.
Hands.
City Hall.
There'll be times when you get older when you'll want to sleep with people just to make them like you. . . But don't. Cause that's another thing that you don't wanna do, everybody That's another thing that you don't wanna do.
A real man wouldn't just run to the hospital! No! What would, what would Krog do?
Oh, this is my friend Roger.
Wow, what is with all the negativity? You sound like Monican't , not Monican... ...Monica. Look, you know, you have been playing around with this catering thing for over three years. Do you want to be a caterer or not?
Hey!
I think on some levels she already knows.
No, no, that's the ghost for the attic.
What? What happened to the window in the attic?!
Oh, okay, see? Things are looking up already!
Yeah! You're such a great friend!
Yes, I...I am with child. And I didn't want to say anything because it's your day; I didn't want to steal your thunder.
Joey. You know, um, he's really nutsy about you.
Wow! That is a bad audition.
My Saturn dealership.
Ooh, I have tasted my own medicine and it is bitter!
Not really, I got to drag him around too!
Yeah... but you should know, I also have a jar of vaseline and a cat skull in here.
No, you can't go there! You know how I feel about these "big massage places"! They're putting people like me out of business!
Yeah, she was bald, she's not now.
I'm having a really good time!
Hey nice boobs.
C'mon Mike, you can beat her! Knock that dog off her head!
Oh wait, one sec. One sec. Hey you! Behind the glass! Who are you looking at! I've always wanted to say that when I was in one of these rooms, which was never!
What do you mean?
It was really fun, I mean I've never talked on a car phone before.
Yeah?
No, you're too late!!! She already took out the trash!!!
Oh that's so sweet thanks.
Well, if you really, really want it, then it's okay.
What?!
Another lie. You have a sickness!
As a masseuse and a human, I'm begging you, never do that to anyone!
Oh, I told the stripper to be here at five. That's good right?
Hi.
Well, I'll tell you Rachel Karen Green, I had plans with Joey tonight and he left me this note.
Okay.
See no-no, I made a batch and I froze it, and this is the only one left.
Uh-hmm.
Well I want to get in on this. Hey Mon? I don't think I can help you after all, I didn't realize this game was on.
You guuuyys.
Oh, got it, stay upwind of me.
Okay! All right! Yeah! 'Cause I just can't picture it.
Okay. 'Jingle bitch screwed me over! Go to hell jingle whore! Go to hell Go to hell. Go to hell-hell-hell.' That's all I have so far.
No!
Hey!
I didn't know where to put it so I just left it here for now.
Yeah.
Aw, God Ross. Oh.
You're gonna be okay?
Well last night, I met Monica's.
Well, maybe she didn't hear! Ok I'm gonna go into that dressing room, you stay in here and I'll talk and see if you can hear me.
Oh. What's a lurker?
Not yet. Umm, I heard they really hurt, do they hurt?
Oh, that's fine, no.
Ooh, yeah. Then what are you going to put on top of that?
No.
Oh yeah, come here.
Hugh! Hugh Grant!
Great!
No, no, he hasn't been around.
Well, I left my guitar here again.
Well umm, okay we were in the market and she bent down to get some yogurt and she just never came back up again.
I know but I'm having so much fun doing good deeds.
Okay, but you cannot tell him... but look whose back!
Yeah and oh, and but there's, there's wind and the wind can make us Goddesses. But you know who takes out wind? Men, they just take it.
Really? You're moving on from Ross?
Did I use that already today? I'm sorry.
'Dear Ms. Buffay. Thank you for calling attention to our error. We have credited your account with five hundred dollars. We're sorry for the inconvenience, and hope you'll accept this- -football phone as our free gift.' Do you believe this?! Now I have a thousand dollars, and a football phone!
What do you mean?
Rachel, didn't have anything that I liked, so, but she had this Christmas ribbon, and I thought, 'All right, fine I'll be political.'
But what?
So, uh, why didn't you say anything?
Well, no, no, wait, wait, wait. All right, I gotta go. Just listen. Promise me, that you will wait a minute before you call her.
Oh, how was last night with Julio, senorita?
Not a good day for birds...
Uh-huh, and a little seed money for the party.
All right, wait! Just wait. Everybody just calm down. Okay? Let's give our friend Joey a chance to explain why he's such a big pervert!
Look at you all grown up.
Hey!
Or you can do volunteer work.
Oh, God, just do it! Call her! Stop being so testosteroney!
Paolo made a pass at me.
Easy. Step. How did it get on?
Why don't you go up there and ask him to 'step lightly, please?'
You sound like a guy.
Yeah, what town are we near?
You've lasted a whole year. Good for you.
But you-you-you came to see Lilly?
That's weird.
No, Jack and the Beanstalk.
No! It's my first birthday with a boyfriend, and he has to work. Uch, I get mad at him, but I think it's a little to soon to show my true colors.
But Mon, you have to get our money!
Ooh-oh! Someone's wearing the same clothes they had on last night. Someone get a little action?
Oh, you're such a gentleman. Come on! We're going to my place!
No-no, let me in!
Oh no, the Mendels, they hate all living things, right?
Somebody went to college. Wow. What is it? I'm sorry.
Fine! Here! Take a hike toots!
Y'know, dirty talk, mnage trois, toys...
What? What are you just gonna walk up to her at the gate? Have you never chased anyone through the airport before?
Where do you think Mike really is?
Nothing, there's nothing wrong with you.
I wa-I wa-I wa...
You ate meat! You had sex!
Oh, ok, you know what I don't get? The way guys can do so many mean things, and then not even care.
Yeah, I know. It drives me crazy.
Okay, but try and get Joey too.
Ooh, maybe that's him!
What?
No. 'Cause you need that. No, it's okay, thanks.
Oh, sure! Bye Ross! Forever.
Oh, Pervert Parade?
I'm so jealous you're all going! I can't believe I never knew that you can't fly in your third trimester!
Okay, just tell me this, did you or did you not smell her hair?
Oof...
Huh. So now, the real question is, who put those fossils there, and why?
Yeah!
So Theodore... I uhm... I can see where Mike gets his good looks from...
Y'know, it's even worse when you're twins.
What?
Umm, Phoebe Buffay.
Yeah, you're right. How's the Mrs.?
Oh hey you guys!
Oh my God, oh my God! Poor Monica!
So, I'm here, ready to play.
Oh, hey, you guys!
I don't know. Who's Soupy Sales?
Yeah, you have homosexual hair.
Umm, you might even say that she pulled a Monica. She doesn't know we switched it.
Okay, scarf's done.
I see what you're doing!
What?
Oh.
Um, yeah. Look, I mean, Im not saying shes like evil or anything. She just, you know, shes always breaking my stuff. When I was eight, and I wouldnt let her have my Judy Jetson thermos, so she threw it under the bus. And then, oh, and then there was Randy Brown, who was like... Have you ever had a boyfriend who was like your best friend?
Hey! Ooh, did you do it yet?
Sure.
Okay, so when you're done with your tea I'll look at your leaves and tell you your fortune.
We could not, would not want to wait.
Yeah. I'm Phoebe Buffay-Hannigan Banana Hammock.
Well umm, do you wanna get something to eat? I'm kinda hungry.
And! And, they're gonna have a baby! And! And, they want me to grow it for them in my uterus.
Hi, you guys.
I thought you were excellent! In fact for a minute there I was like, "Ooh, where'd Ross go?"
Or... maybe she has trouble loosening your knots because you're such a high maintenance tight ass!
32.
Where is everyone? They're forty minutes late.
Well, I-I thought a lot about what you said, and um, I realilized duh, all right maybe I was a little judgmental. Yeah, oh, but oh...
No! You should've read it yourself!
It's not mine, I didn't earn it, if I kept it, it would be like stealing.
You guys, we said we were gonna have fun! Come on, hey, remember the time... You don't remember?
Sure.
Oh yeah-No, she was really nice to me, but she's in hell for sure.
No.
Yeah?
Yeah, yeah, first there was my aunt Mary, and then there was umm, John, my mailman, and then my, my cowboy friend 'Albino Bob'.
Where did you go to do it?
Wait a minute! So when Emily comes you're just, you're not gonna see Rachel anymore?
Okay, my turn. My turn. Oh! You're so cute! Oh, I could squeeze your little head! I won't.
It's in the cake, isn't it?
Great, ok faster! "je"
Yeah. Um... I'm out.
Ooh, the pizza guy's here!
Yeah, I've discovered that Ross forgot to take his brain medicine, uh, now without it, uh, in the brain of Ross, uh women's names are interchangeable, through-through no fault of his own.
Well, I'm watching it for some friends who went out of town. Wait. Hello, my name is Clunkers. May I please stay with you nice people?
Umm, hey Rach, can I ask you something?
Yeah that's right Chandler does still think I'm pregnant. He hasn't asked me how I'm feeling or offered to carry my bags. Boy, I feel bad for the woman who ends up with him. After you of course.
... with the double double double-jointed boy. Hey. So um, are you the professional guitar player?
Uma Thurman.
Oh this is so ho-o-ot!
I'm, I'm breaking up with you.
No, just a regular old flying dwarf.
All right, get a room.
Whoa! I kinda liked it.
Oh we can't, we already have plans.
You're thing. You're thing. Y'know? You're the guy who gets divorced.
Hey, what's going on?
Yeah I know what I wanted to ask you. Um, can you roll your tongue? Because I can, and my Mom couldn't, and I thought y'know, I figured that was something I got from our Dad.
Yeah, I definitely. I don't like the name Ross.
Hey, you know what, I've never had a one-year anniversary before, so no matter where we go, I'm wearing something fancy pants, and... I'm gonna put on my finest jewelry and we're gonna have sex in a public rest room.
Don't tear it.
And a crusty old man said I'll do what I can and the rest of the rats played moroccas. That's it, thanks, good night.
Yeah, you too.
While drinking...
Nesele Toulouse.
Ok, ok, she's taking the trash out so I can get you out of here but it has to be now, she'll be back any minute.
Hey there, you handsome thing.
Uh-huh! I'm so...happy.
Rehearse it!
I want to keep one.
I-I-I like, I like parties.
Yep!
Yeah... That does sound great. I'm going to get the phone.
You know what, we're gonna have sex. Let's just leave it there.
Hey!
I'm telling you he's dead. What we are about to have here is a dead fat guy on a stick.
About 20 minutes. CLOSING CREDITS
Okay. All right. Good luck explaining all the calls to China.
Yeah, well, everybody does! I'm a really cool person. And y'know you had 29 years to find that out, but you didn't even try! Y'know what, you walked out on me, and I'm just, I'm gonna do the same thing to you.
Excuse me, excuse me! Yeah, noisy boys! Is it something that you would like to share with the entire group?
That game should not be played without my supervision.
I knew it!
Hey!
Oh, well, actually.
Ohh! Oh my. Oh, that reminds me, I have to see my OB-GYN today.
Joey.
Yeah, otherwise, I mean that's, that's, that's just it for us hanging out together. Y'know is that what you want? Can you be civil?
Yeah? Okay, I think I'll play it at the wedding.
Ok, you can do this. It's just like pulling off a Band-aid. Just do it really fast, and then the wound is exposed.
God! God! This is not going well.
Okay, now's not the time Joey. All right? You can yell at me tomorrow.
Oh, alright, that's it, now I have to go see him.
Well, and you know, it really is a testament to how he was raised. Especially to you. Because he's very respectful of women.
Right, oh yeah. Wow, oh, it looks like Ross is breaking up with her. Uff, I hope he lets her down easy. Let's go.
Yeah, I know! So, what do you think?
Joey.
Hey!
Two?
Alright you guys, we can't turn on each other, Okay? That's just what she wants.
Ooh ooh, we have a live one!
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Done. Oh good, really?
Wait, you can't take the money out.
Oh my God! I don't believe it! Oh, you poor bunny.
Wow! That's so great! Oh! Oh! Cougar.
Oh, you're not going? Oh, why?
Oh! Yeah, this is fun, couples night.
No-no wait-wait! I can't just let you hang up! Just please talk to me.
Maybe you need to spice things up a little.
Oh no, I'm not playing tonight.
Okay. Okay! Well okay, who do we know that's coming? Me. Are you?
Are you ready for your Scottish massage? Put your face in the hole, lassy.
Really? Chandler?
See? This is why you register.
Look, he gave me his night vision goggles and everything.
Oh, yeah! Back then y'know, we called the Great War. It really was!
You don't wanna win the lottery?
Okay, Lesson One: Chords. Now, I Don'T Know The Actual Names Of The Chords But Umm, I-I-I Made Up Names For The Way My Hand Looks While I'M Doing Them. So then, this is Bear Claw. Okay, umm, Turkey Leg and Old Lady.
Yeah! Okay, here you go.
No.
No I'm not! You are!
No, listening! Sit! Y'know, maybe it would just really, really help if you would just talk.
Rachel? Patrick is really rich. Give her some money.
Yes! Oh no!
Ross, you're tired. You've been looking all night. And clearly you suck at this.
No I'm not okay. The only guy I've ever been crazy about has gone to Minsk and I may never...I may never see him again.
Maybe, maybe I'll dance for you.
Ok, do you know A minor?
Oh.
She must've left.
Oh, okay, it's the slide instead of stairs. Watch this.
Hey.
That's okay. If - if we hit anything, the engine will explode, so you know, it's better if you're thrown from the car.
Hi Monica.
Yeah, from now on everyone you lurk, I'm gonna lurk first! You move on to someone else, I'm gonna be one step ahead of you, every single time! And then I'll be on your ass every hour of every day 'til Monday, because that's when I go home. When do you leave?
Ohh, ok, I see what you did there. Aren't you afraid though, that the writers are gonna be kinda mad when they read this?
Yeah it is! It is! It's freshwater eel!
Now... "Who will perform the ceremony! Who will perform the cer--Oh-oh! All right, I'll pound on him in the morning.
Yeah, I might have said yes, but that would have been wrong.
It was the end of the party, you were probably ironing wrapping paper.
Wow! You guys really don't know anything!
Oh, I don't know. Umm, how about the fact that the underwear out there on the telephone pole is yours from when you were having sex with Fun Bobby out on the terrace.
No, look, I told you that I didn't want you to try and sell it, and you just, you big fat did it anyway. God, y'know what, I think five years ago I probably would've done anything to play with you but, I can do it by myself. And if I can't trust you then just forget it.
Hey Rach.
Whe-where did he put it?!
Yeah, it's totally meant to be. Tell him who you originally wanted to hook up with that night.
It's Phoebe! Phoebe!
Oh... okay.
No spark? Didn't you sleep together?
Yeah! I wrote Emma a song.
Or maybe he-he was writing to tell her that-that he's changed his name, y'know? Tell Monica I'm sorry.
What?! Why bother?
Yeah. Oh, that's gone too. This is Monica's bathroom right?!
Okay quick, help me get this off!
Well, you said that you had customers lined up in the street, so I am here to entertain!
Okay, see, see, everyone else is happy she's done.
Woof, woof.
Toll-booth.

Okay.
Don't point that thing at me, Tribbiani!
Oh, it's a secret. Oh goodie! Yes! We haven't done the secret thing in a long time.
Yeah, but did they have to shoot him down? I mean, that was just mean.
Well okay, it's already February and I've only given two massages and they were both the worst tippers in the world!
I know! Robin is so gay!
Oh God. So-so you're making porn movies.
Y'know, there's gonna be lots of other stuff.
Oh, you are so much the smitten kitten. You should ask him out.
Yeah, I actually don't know...
Well, I didn't think I should just drop by...
Yeah, well, don't "Aww Pheebs, that sucks!" me yet.
It really is.
So, I guess this is it.
Shiny.
That is so great! Oh, I... Oh my God!
Did you ever feed him a poison capsule that made him bleed from the eyes?
Oooh. Oh, well this is awkward.
What?!
Yeah but, Mischa is so interested in you, that Sergei and I haven't been able to say two words to each other.
Really?! I looked into that. Yeah, but, I mean it costs like $60,000 and y'know you can die. And, you would die!
Alright, I'm sorry but these people needed me. They work hard all week, it's Saturday night, they deserve to have a little fun. Go.
Oohh, um, no, I don't think that's the problem. 'Cause we went, um, dancing the other night and the way he held me so close, and the way he was looking into my eyes I just like... definitely felt something.
Mr. Bing's office. No I'm sorry, he's in a meeting right now.
Umm, sympathy pains. I thought it was really sweet at first, but now I think he's just trying to steal my thunder.
It's okay, I mean she had a really incredible life. And it's not like I'm never gonna see her again, y'know she's gonna visit.
Wrong? Really? You know the word wrong. Everything isn't perfect? Everything isn't magical? Everything isn't a glow with the light of a million fairies? They were just brake lights, Parker!
No! Barry and Mindy.
Yep! Okay, gotta go, talk to you later.
Oh my God, you're giving your real number.
Why, nobody good?
No, what's more important, your friends or money?
And do you know what girls are really good at?
Did you find the dress?
Yeah.
If you hadn't just had a baby with my best friend I swear to Lucifer a raber dog would be feasting on your danglers RIGHT NOW!
Thankfully you don't need me at all so Okay Super aunt see you later! Rachel let's give it six to eight months .
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm just a little nervous.
Fish!
Uh-huh, yeah, that's my cheat sheet.
I didn't do it! It was Chandler! He's... He's mad at you!
Joey!
All right all ready.
Hi. Y'know in England this car would be on the other side of the store. Woo!
We're moving in together! Isn't it great! Yay!
It's a Thanksgiving miracle!
Please, I think you know why.
YOU'RE SO GENEROUS AND KIND AND YOU'RE AMAZING IN BED IT'S OUR ANNIVERSARY!
Yeah. But I also believed her when she said I was next.
Hey you guys, you will never guess who's coming to New York.
Phoebe, just watch that, I promise it will resotre all your faith in humanity.
Horseback riding?
What make you think I can?!
Okay I've got one for you, if you had too which one would you rather eat, a seeing eye dog or a talking gorilla?
This is my father, this is a picture of my dad.
I do! I do! I do! I do! Ugh, like I can really chase you. I'm carrying a litter.
No. I've learned my lesson.
...in you, my endless love. My endless love.
I know. They were mine.
You don't need Janice for that, you've got us. We...
Well, he's never coming back! Okay? You just cost me eight dollars a week!
Really? Not even to, um, change his PAJAMAS?!
Wanna go see a movie?
ok I can't do this.
I'm not asking!
Yeah! It's so much better than first grade when you don't know what's going on and definitely better than third grade. Y'know with all the politics and mind games.
Just, 'cause, I don't want her to go through what I went through with Carl- oh!
Hey.
They found their bodies the very next day, they found their bodies the very next... la la la la la la.
And that horrible museum tour!
I would, but you're the last one.
It's okay. How's the soup?
I, I have to go before I put your head through a wall.
Uh-huh. You've met your match Rachel Green.
What?
Ross, where are you going?
I see. Nice sidestep on the do do thing by the way.
May I ask why?
Ohh, well, you're my lucky penny.
No, I wasn't gonna ask you that, no.
I don't know, they both want to live in a house of cheese! I don't know how you fight that.
Look, look!
I don't see her.
Oh, is the play over?
Or, we can decide by whose ever name is closer to the word phone.
I know, I'm sorry! But y'know, this ring is better! Monica never even saw the other ring.
Should we do something?
Hummus. I got the hummus.
What are people having, the garlic Martini?
Make sure you check Chandler's jewelry box.
Yeah?
Hi, guys.
Okay, good.
You know... You're gonna be really, really hard to get over.
Really?
Do the claws again.
No.
That sounds great!
And they were serving franks which is his first name minus the s at the end. And there was a rotisserie with spinning chicken.
It's negative.
Oh my God, I remember now! We were playing chess!
What does the sign say?
Oh. Ha-ha-ha. All right, anyway...

Oh, I hear divorce bells.
It's gotta be better than that book. Oo! Like a crossbow!
Listen to this! My reading was wrong, I'm not going die!
Umm, okay I would like to talk to you about your toner needs.
Oh, this is terrible. Oh, they've made so many changes I can't even feel my grandmother's presence anymore-Ooh! New sconces!
Eeee!!! Eee!! Eee!!
Was that story over?
What did he say?
So Chandler, I-I'd love to come by tonight.
No no no, I'll be nice, I swear!!! Could you just give me the number for where they are?
No, I know what a silent is I meant, what's going on with your hair?
Okay, um, oh, the zoo commercial.
Hey Monica, what about your extra tickets?
Ohh. What is this?
That's so funny to think if you'd just done that right after the last contest, no one would have had to move at all.
Okay, don't freak out. I'll go.
Oh Joey, we've heard the specials three times! Okay? There's prime rib, mahi mahi, and a very special lobster ravioli.
You mean in case someone is trying to steal your bamboo sleeping mat or your kettle of fish?
Okay!
So did Heldi show you the place?
Oh yeah? Well, let's see. Ok, duck down.
Oh no, how?
What?
Okay but that's why you have to buy it, so it can fulfil it's Christmas destiny, otherwise there gonna throw it into the chipper. Tell him, Joey
Monica, can I talk to you behind my menu, please. What are you doing?
That'll work too.
Oh, hello liar.
See? This is exactly why you shouldn't lie!
Yeah well, in America you're just an "ass".
Thank you.
Now wasn't Joey hitting on her at the wedding too?
You told them he was missing?
So long! Don't let the best door in the world hit you in the ass on your way out!
It's just y'know, been a couple of hours, and she hasn't called. Not that I even care, y'know.
I thought I was going home to go to bed, but I'm sensing there's something less fun for me to do here.
We were out of Doritos.
You know, I'm always right about these things.
Yes, and her boyfriend. But we're celebrating Thanksgiving in December 'cause he is lunar.
Oh my God.
And there's a country called Argentinaaaa, it's a place I've never seeeeen. But I'm told for fifty pesos you can buy a human spleen. Humaaan spleeeeen. Ole!
You got it! Ok. But not on the wine that you made, ok, because I just don't want to go back to the Emergency Room.
Everybody, this is Parker, Parker this is...
Yeah, okay, let's talk it out.
Well my guy is spectacular. Okay? He's a massage client and one time umm, when he was on the table, I looked at it. And I mean all of it.
Oh, well, then you'll have extra seats, you know, for all your tiaras and stuff.
Well I have a video, you have to pay attention. No this, this voice woman, she's so talented but, according to the producer people, they said she doesn't have like the right look or something, ya know. I mean, it's like, she's like one of those an imals at the pound who like nobody wants 'cause they're not pretty enough or you know. Like, like some old dog who's just kind of like stinky and. Huuuuh, oh my God, she's smelly cat. Oh, oh that song has so many levels.
Okay. Do you guys want me to play for you?
Okay, is this the day of good news or what? I got us a job! The wedding reception.
Yeah I bet! Look out!
Is she in there?
I've never been more convinced of your love for her.
Oh, you didn't have to come in with me.
I have plans.
Oh my God! So was she! Oh, I've got-I've got goose bumps.
Give it!
Look, Precious... Mike's not worth this. You're an attractive, intelligent woman and let's face it, Mike's kind of a wang. I mean, he proposed to me while he was still seeing you... He was gonna break-up with you on your birthday? And, I don't like to kiss-and-tell, but he cheated on you a lot this weekend.
Okay.
Oo! You should have one of us do it!
Oh, mon Dieu!
Okay, alright, I have a question, then.
Oh, I...
Alright, here's my $7.50. But I think you should know that this money is cursed.
One? How about a whole bunch?
Ewwww!!
Oh that tart... floozy... giant...
Well, what am I going to tell Monica? She wants to wear them tonight!
All right.
Uh... yay!
Yeah, 'cause hello, these are not her boobies, these are her breasts.
Yeah?
I'd call that excessive.
You're pregnant!
"Whenever I get married, guess who won't get to sing? Somebody named Geller! And somebody else named Bing!"
We have good news, look whose back!
It's-it's not negative, it's positive.
Come on, seriously! When did it end?
Hi. Um, I want to start with a song thats about that moment when you suddenly realize what life is all about. OK, here we go. OK, thank you very much.
Oh yeah, it'll be fun.
Oh, so this is all about money! Y'know it's bad enough that-Ow! Oh, you have got to be kidding!
Ow!!!
Oh, how do you play the shadow game?
Yes, you will be very sad. All right, well I gotta go tell Rachel the good news.
Oh, Rachel and I have appointments to get our hair cut.
Yeah!
That's funny, no. Cadillac, cataract, I get it, no I get it, you stay out there.
No, that's not necessary.
Okay.
Hey. Everything ok?
But Emma's got what it takes, she could go all the way!
I got it.
For how long?
That man across the street just kicked that pigeon! Oh!
So you guys'll stay here and hang out with me?
Yeah okay... yeah, your mom... okay... She looks nice, I can talk to her.
Oh, for god's sake, Judy, pick up the sock! Pick up the sock! Pick up the sock! I'm sorry, was that rude? Di-did my, my li-little outburst blunt the hideousness that is this evening? Look, I know, you all have a lot going on, but all I wanted to do was have dinner with my friends on my birthday. And you are all so late and you didn't even have the courtesy to call. Well, it's too late now.
Okay, I didn't understand that, but y'know, maybe that's 'cause you were speaking the secret language of love!
I've had better.
Maybe there's someone else.
Oh God!
Stay.
No.
Okay, but, well, before you say no, my friend Susanne is entering her kid and compared to Emma she's a real dog!
Okay, obviously you don't know much about the U.S. government.
Aw! Hey, do you think that Susan person is her lover?
I'm sorry.
These are not mine... Look how flimsy they are, come on! Good God! You try to hang a guy from a waterpipe with these, they'll snap like a piece of licorice.
Seriously? You divorce-o?
Ok, I'll fight for her. Ok! Oh, wait, oh I just realized... if I do that, that means you don't get her.
My God, I can't get a minute of peace around this place.
Huh?
Now if you want to receive e-mails about my upcoming shows, then please give me money so I can buy a computer.
Oh!!
I'm a woman!
Better!
Just kidding!
That is unfair. I'll call her and tell her it was totally my fault.
Y'know, suddenly I find you very attractive.
What is it?
Wait, if that's his favourite area, why is he being so mean to it?
Let's try something else, let's play a game.
Well okay but I have two tickets to the ballroom dance finals.
I was just being polite!
Umm, I...I just think you don't expect someone so hot to be so sweet.
There is nothing wrong with Jake! Okay? He is all man! I'm thinking even more than you.
No, no, no, I wouldn't do you myself, I mean that would be weird. Yeah, no, I'll get one of the other girls to do it. Oh, this will be so much fun! Hey! Are you excited?
Hi!
uh huh how do I look.
Ow-ow-ow-ow! Oh my God!!!
You've never asked a guy out?!!
I could've been killed I hope you know!
leave...
Ahh. OK, let's see yours again.
Oh, no no, that side doesn't have one, the paramedics had to cut through it.
OOOOOHHHHH!
What is that sparkly thing?
We should help him!
That chick can't handle my corner.
Really?! Joey?! You don't say.
Excuse me? Could you help me with something? The patient I'm looking for has a broken leg and is in a wheelchair. And umm, he's like early to mid-thirties, very attractive.
She seems fine now.
Oh, yeah!
Go, go, go Alan! Run you, hairy bastard! end.
Oh, it's like the mother ship is calling you home.
Yeah, why don't you just find another apartment?
Okay Rachel, I can't wait to live with you! And you know what we should do? Bring Monica and then we could all live there together! We'll have so much fun!!
Mon! I'm so happy for you!
Monica, I really appreciate you checking in on me, but I'm actually feeling a lot better. Yeah, I just kinda want to be alone right now.
Well, c'mon, if it's important enough to discuss while I'm playing, then I assume it's important enough for everyone else to hear!
Whoa! Why do you get to answer the door?
Now, wait a minute. So, they're gonna name their first child Joey?
Fire alarm? Oh! Hi, officer-fireman, can-can I help you?
Oh no! Not that guy! He does look like him though.
Okay but if you don't find him and bring him back, I am gonna hunt you down and kick your ass!
You don't like ice cream?
Okay, I'll be out in a second.
Yeah, but if I do tell him, then he's gonna hate myself. I mean look at him and his Mom, I can't. But, you guys can, please you gotta talk him out of it.
Oh.
Oh well, I guess Italian isn't one of the four languages you speak.
"Pick up grandma at the airport"?
Works on you.
Because you'll date her once, sleep with her and then forget she exists!
Oh.
Yes! She's very excited about that.
Oh. Mine does. Stephanie knows all the chords.
Yeah, yeah but I am not sure about some of the bra's I got.
Oh yeah.
Uh-hmm.
No!
Cabin of loooooovvvvve.
What are you saying?!
You're-you're what?!
Mike doesn't ever wanna get married.
Hey! I got you a present!!
Okay. If you're alive you answer your phone!
Okay. Come on! That's not running! Let's go!
So wow, it looks like you took care of everything. Thanks a lot, co-host.
Alright, so, what, he's not a famous tree surgeon? And then, I guess, OK, he doesn't live in a hut in Burma where there's no phones?
Well, lots of people! Look, are you coming to memorial service or not?
Oh yes, I see what you mean. That look is priceless.
No. No, he is my submaring guy. He resurfaces like every couple years and we have the most amazing three days together. Only this time he's coming for two weeks. Two whole weeks, which means yay.
Oh-oh no she doesn't! I know what that is. You can stay.
Because I'm going to kill him
Hey.
Come on Joey, don't make me feel badly about this.
Oh, look at little Leslie stretching in her sleep.
Hey, why don't you guys go, get portraits done by a professional photographer.
Haaaa... ... ahhhh!
Or...or we can chant and dance around naked, you know, with sticks.
You know that's... that's her.
Okay, this will keep them away from your stuff.
You know what Amanda said to me when she got me on the phone? "Oh, so sorry to catch you on your Mo-Bile!" If-if you don't wanna get me on my mo-Bile, don't call me on my mo-Bile!"
I want to, but I just want you to tell me that marriage isn't really that big a deal. You know that I won't, I won't be missing out on anything. That marriage stinks!
I'm fine, thanks.
Hey!
Oh, I like my job.
Don't get me started on that.
Hi! It's me. And soup. Hey, I just saw Josh, he looks so yummy in your leather jacket.
What does that mean? Does he sell it, drink it, or just complain a lot?
I wanna get married.
Thank you. Okay, go! Go! Go! Now, if after dinner you still really need to bust someone, I know a hot dog vendor who picks his nose.
Yeah! What are you saying?
Okay, I understand why Superman is here, but why is there a porcupine at the Easter Bunny's funeral?
What about Ross? What about your moment? Don't you want to talk to Ross about it?
Oh, good, good, you guys are here! Listen, how would like to spend tomorrow taking care of three incredibly cute little puppies?!
Umm, no thank you.
OK, Rachel, I'm ready.
You were supposed to tell her!
Ohh. Oh wait! you guys won't be late for my dinner, will you?
Well, it's this guy I used to massage. And by massage, I mean hold down so he wouldn't turn over and flash me.
Oh. Well is she, is she the first that you've been with?
Gary.
Hey!
But, but this is my gig. This is where I play. My, my name is written out there in chalk. You know, you can't just erase chalk.
Really? You can actually see it?
Uck, look at this! Pottery Barn, yuck!
Oh, yeah, Bob said there might be flood damage.
Hey! New wallet, huh?
Me too! Oh! Did you ever see An Officer and a Gentleman?
David the scientist guy, David that I was in love with, David who went to Russia and broke my heart David!
No! Wait! I was just saying that so you'd think I was a good person. Fight for me.
What? You mean behind my back?
I don't know, I kinda like Bob for a girl.
Because the more I drink, the less there is for the kids to drink.
All right. Ok, but, but! You have to promise that you will not be all like control-y and bossy and Monica about it.
Ohhh.
Ok, well that's bad. But don't you think it might be different with someone else? Perhaps a blonde who always uses a toilet. Except for once in the ocean.
Okay, fine. Come dinosaur, we're not welcome in the house of no imagination.
I'm sorry, for the last time, why aren't you two together again? No, I know. I know, because you're not in that place. Which would be fine, except you totally are.
Hey! Check it out! This is unbelievable! Joey has been holding his breath for almost four minutes!
You can open your eyes now.
I hate my regular clothes now! Y'know? I look down and-and I know that this isn't gonna be the most special day of my life.
Oh my God, has she slept at all?
Okay! Rach, hi, I need those earrings you borrowed.
Pay the caterer! Look, I've had a lot of jobs, okay, and there are some people who just always try to get out of paying. It's either, you know, "that massage wasn't long enough, or, "I don't recognize any of those songs," or, you know, "these sombreros aren't big enough. Bad little white girl!"
That sucks! That's not a trip! I just came from the park! What are we gonna high five about at the stupid Central Park? "Well, it's right by my house, all right!"
I know!
Isn't it at three?
Um, no, huh-uh. One of my clients died on the massage table today.
Ok.
Thinkin' about it.
Yeah, but then I can be you sidekick Vunda.
W-w-I just-it's that-I have-y'know I have-I have an appointment. And it's very important.
Yep!
Fine. But you can't help me develop my new universal language.
Chandler.
I miss Janice though. "Hello, Chandler Bing."
Yeah. You're just gonna knock on his door and change his life forever. You're like Ed McMahon except without the big check, or the raw sexual magnetism.
Hey.
Oh, I don't know, I don't know, isn't that a little desperate?
Wait, does he eat chalk?
Well just figure out a way to talk him out of it.
Well that's great! Congratulations!!
I'm so glad you could make it.
Yeah!
She's right! You have to stop!
And-and you're using my name!
Yeah, you should.
No, that's my stepdad. My real dad's the one that ran out on us before I was born.
I'm coming! I'm coming!
Hey will you get me tickets too?
And we don't want any recognition. This is completely anonymous.
Y'know you guys were a lot more supportive when I wanted to make denim furniture.
Hi.
All right, stop it, you're freaking me out.
Oh, that's great!!
Joey, it's a birthday party.
Oh, hi Chandler. It's Phoebe. Uhm... I know that Monica is working today so... ...I was wondering if you want to come to the movies with me and Rachel.
"Crazy underwear, creepin' up my butt. Crazy underwear, always in a rut. Crazy under--wear..." Oh No! What is he doing here? All right, just keep playing, just keep playing. You'll get through this; you'll be fine. Okay, thank you. And, as always no one talk to me after the show.
Oh, David, I, I think you are a sweeping sorta fella. I mean, you're a sweeper! ...trapped inside a physicist's body.
We know about your party Joey.
Oh! No problem! I...
Don't you just love the way they talk?!
Yeah. I really like his glasses.
Okay, well they are a huge responsibility, especially at this age. They require constant care. They-they need just the right food, and lot's and lot's of love.
No! We're gonna do it my way. Because your way is stupid! Alright I gotta go, I have another call, Reverend. Hello?
Yeah, she clamed she had to go out of town suddenly. She's avoiding me, she doesn't want to tell me where my Father is. She knows, and she won't tell me.
All right, y'know forget hypnosis. The way to quit smoking is you have to dance naked in a field of heather, and then bath in the sweat of six healthy young men.
Hey sweetie!
Oh! I can't believe it. I can't believe this. We're just like, sitting at home, trying to guess Joey's fingers, and you guys are out like partying and having fun, and you know, all, "hey, Blowfish, suck on my neck".
I'd say that chair's taking the brunt.
Okay, now would you say that that's more than 50 yards away from Sting, his wife, or a member of his family?
Yeah, I know, but I don't think that means anything.
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. Ugly Naked Guy is decorating his tree. Oh my God, you should see the size of his Christmas Balls.
You see? Nothing is good enough for her!
Why? It's fun, it's different, no-one else has a name like it.
Yeah, my mom used to put her head in the oven. Well, actually, she only did it the one time. But it was pretty weird.
Ooh, great! Just the reaction I was hoping for.
Yeah, not the one I had my eye on.
Oh, oh, good.
Can I tell you a little secret?
Uh huh.
Joey, it's Estelle.
Yeah, well, I'm very angry at him, because he slept with me and never called me back.
Please Rachel, I am not an idiot.
Then that's not breaking the law! I'm there!
All right, there are no questions in the happy place. Okay, just, the warm breeze, and the moonlight flowing through the trees....
I know, I'm sorry, please forgive me. I don't know what to say.
Yeah, y'know what I noticed Rachel? He scares easy. Is that the kind of guy you'd like to take to a ball? "Hey Sebastian, would you like to dance?" "Uhh, okay-I gotta go!"
Are you kidding? The woman has the nose of a bloodhound ... and the breasts of a Greek goddess.
I'll find Bob, I'll get him. Bob? Bob! Robert! Oh wait, I think I hear him. Oh - Oh my god! Bob had babies! Bob's a mom!
Good choice.
Oh my God!! You threw Pepper on the fire!
It's not all mine. We all get 50 cents.
Um, cake.
Why would you start again after chewing all that quitting gum?
Hi!
Chicken. Which is so ironic considering I'm a vegetarian.
You guys are so pathetic, I, oh, OH, XANADU! OH.
You said it was okay!
I am.
Yes, we should. I think we should.
No but, why does that have to be a bad thing. Just change what it means. Y'know? Go down there and prove your Mother wrong. Finish the job you were hired to do, and we'll call that pulling a Monica.
Why not?
Yes.
Good! Good! I was just testing you.
Oh, I don't know. I mean it was fun one time.
You're right! You're right. Don't say it.
Was it my work? Were they mad? Was it Jack? Did he yell?!
Come on, you guys, you have nothing to lose, I have everything to lose. Do you want me to lose everything? Everything?!
Regina Philange.
Oh my God, you've got to stop chattering!
So nothing got ruined?
I wouldn't bring that up, it would probably just bum him out.
I know. It's just y'know usually when you're, when you're done with the pregnant thing, y'know, then you get to do the mom thing. I'm gonna be y'know, sitting around in my leather pants, drinking Tequila.
I don't have a fax machine.
Because I cared enough to lie!
Oh, Greg and Jenny yuck! Hi Greg, I'm Chandler this is Monica. Hi Monica, this is Jenny. Hi Jenny. Hi Greg.
Okay. Wait, do you know how you're going to stall her?
Wait a minute. Dr. Drake Ramoray and I work at the same hospital. Wouldn't I come over to say hi to him?
Yeah, I just don't buy it.
Yeah, no, Ralph doesn't look anything like that guy. He's-he's young and he's got long hair and a beard and a hacky sack.
Absolutely!
Oh that's right. You're still set on that?
Sorry Frank, I'm kinda in the middle of the last favor you asked me to do.
Oh, have a great wedding!
You think?
Did he mention us?
Much as you are.
CHANDLER AND MONICA!!!!
I don't know how to say this, but I think when your wife's spirit left her body, it um, kind of stuck around in me.
You must be Hilda.
Oh God, Korea is such a beautiful country.
Yeah! Now, why do you want to kill yourself?
Happy, happy Chanukah, Chandler and Monica. Very merry...
Wait! This seat is really uncomfortable! Yeah, maybe before we start we should just get another one. Perhaps, like an airplane seat-or a beanbag chair!
Of course they do! Or I'm just really hungry.
Oh that's good, the chemistry thing for us too.
Oh my God!
Joey, look at me! I'm a nurse!
Sounds like you're a little jealous.
Uh, Ross, those are the only lines we have, sorry. OK, you guys, once more.
Are you sure?
I have this feeling that something's wrong with it. Something is wrong with the left Philange.
What a beautiful night to be running around the street, looking for tickets. And the wind sure made it fun.
Oh yay! Great! Okay, what room number is he in?
Hi! Hi! Listen, my friend Ross is about to be divorced for the third time, but wouldn't you date him?
Yes, it was! It was him! Uh huh! Okay, it was me!
Ooh Monica!
Wow, a house for dolls, that is so cool! When I was kid, I had a barrel.
What?! I think he's cute.
Well, then tell him to stop staring!
Oh, oh! It's on again!
This pregnancy is throwing me all off.
I'm sorry.
Oh good, I didn't miss the party.
Good.
Oh... No, I did that for someone once and I'm not comfortable having that kind of power and control over someone's life.
WHAT!
Huh?
Yeah, yeah!
Yeah, or, or, or, Mississ-Pete.
Please, right now, no, every time I see him it's like 'Is it on the lose?' 'Is it watching me?'
But I already gave them back to you!
Uh-huh.
What?
OK. Ooh, OK, you gotta give me a second, I wanna get this just right. Dude, 11 o'clock, totally hot babe checkin' you out. That was really good, I think I'm ready for my penis now.
I know, but that creep that I went on that date with goes to there so I have to find a new one. I also have to find a new video store, a new bank, a new adult bookstore, a new grocery store...
There we go.You know what, if we were in prison, you guys would be, like, my bitches.
And chili!
Yeah, but so is this.
What?
Holy crap!
Sing!!
Oh I-I don't know about that. No, I think that if the two of you had sex the-the-the repercussions would be catastrophic.
Oh! We could have done that.
Oh, but, could we not go together? I,I don't wanna be the geek that invited the boss.
Monica your remote doesn't work.
Oh my God! I'm sorry, too soon. You go.
I'm sorry, I broke down... I wanted to see him.
Oh, Chandler funny?
Why?
Ah!!
Wait! Maybe, maybe you're overreacting! You do that y'know.
Well, if I'm going down, I'm taking you with me. Harboring a fugitive? That's one to three years minimum. Good luck Chandler. Okay, you can arrest me. Fine. But you'll never make it stick and you know it!

You like Joey?
Hello? Yes, I'm the one who found your phone.
Well, some things are just hard to say to your face.
I am happy.
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't hear you over all the winning.
Oh, I get more because I'm dainty.
I, OK....
Oh, ok, murder, cancer, soccer teams eating each other in the Andes.
Oh no! That really is nothing, she is very sexually aggressive.
Really?!
Let's see!
Oh sure! Noo!
Oh my God!!
Can you?
We stand firm at $10.
Hey! I've got a great idea for party favors for the shower. Okay, we get some uh mahogany boxes and carve everyone's names in them and inside is everyone's individual birth stone.
Uh huh. Why is that?
Uhm... well, they're not in the wedding.
Nothing, I'm sorry, I'm just, I'm out of sorts.
Ugh. Come on, Mona, don't kiss ass.
No, look, don't touch that!
Wow, Mike Hannigan...You sure know how to make a girl say "Hell yeah!"
No, no maybe 'cause it's harder to raise them, and the added expense, and...
None the less.
Ooh, Joey.
Please.
It's so inspired! Look at him! Look at him go!
As a matter of fact she said that's how I am going to die. So, excuse me for being a little skittish.
What the hell is this, herbal tea? I hate herbal tea!
No, no-no, she was a human lady. This is the spirit of my Mom Lily, the one who killed herself.
Yeah, swing music is so out.
Ooh, let's see it!
I know. Oh, like you would drink her coffee after what you did to her with Van Damme.
Oh yes, they are.
Yeah well, that's 'cause Monica put me in charge of cups and ice, and Monica is gonna rue the day that she put me in charge of cups and ice.
'Hey! You're not dead! Okay, see ya!'
Okay, I'm gonna go too!
But that woman can't know I work here. She's a friend of mine and I made this big stink about how awful this massage chains are.
All right, the seven of us miss you.
Yeah! Have a great honeymoon!
Umm, well I sorta have some bad news, can I come in?
Hey, does Monica know about her broken plates yet?
Y'know Rach, I think that, I think you should be Monica's made of honor.
Joey stuffing 15 Oreos in his mouth.
Come on Ross, you're a paleontologist, dig a little deeper.
We don't know.
You completely stole my answer!
Okay.
Yeah, I'm so good in this scene that I'm stealing focus from you. Well, rise to the challenge Tribianni 'cause I just raised the bar. Come join me up here!
Hey, it's your Thanksgiving too, y'know, instead of watching football, you could help.
Okay, you can totally say no, but umm, would it be okay with you if I set Ross up on a date?
What were you modeling for?
So he's probably really nervous around women, y'know? Maybe, you just have to make the first move.
Ok, how about... uhm... sex or dinosaurs?
Oh my God!!!
It's Joey!
Oh hey! Wait up!
Yu-huh. That's when my mother would shut off the TV and say 'The end'.
Well, they may be a handful, but they're so cute.
Okay, don't sweat it. Chandler is nowhere around so go ahead get it out of your system. That guy's cute.
Hey!
The movie?
Now do me, do my back. Oh come on, harder.
No, whatever! Anything!
But lately all the guys I meet seem really nice at first, then they turn out to be the biggest jerks.
Oh my God Monica!
Ecoutez, je vais vous dire la verite. C'est mon petit frere. Il est un peu retarde.
Ross!
Oh, please! She's always got a broom in her hand!
Really?!
Oh, you just caught me off guard! Yeah, that would be nice.
Okay.
No, you threw out Phoebe. I'm Ms. Regina Phalange. Phalange!
Oh OK. Oh no, oh it's gone, that's so weird, I don't know how-where it went.
I'm so, so, so sorry, Joey. I definitely am gonna see you're play. I swear you're play is very important to us, thank you for your patience. You're play is the next play is the next play I'm gonna see.
Sure!
No, it's not! We were just goofing around and I dared him to try them on.
All right. Well, don't worry, I call shotgun!
Yeah, it was really hard.
So-so, what do you want for lunch?
30 seconds.
You have chalk on your face.
No-no, we do it every year!
Get over here!
No! No, the robots just work for them.
Hi!
Oh! Oh! Oh!
Oh, hey, Monica, I brought back your iron.
I thought you meant in life.
All right fine! This looks like so much fun.
Hey!
Bye.
I could be a secretary.
I suppose I could tell her it's just all my fault.
Okay, what about after I give you these candies?
Yeah? And, he's-he's so centered and mature and confident.
Yeah, I'm a big surprise.
Ohh, yes it would.
I can't believe it! I did it! I rode a bike! I never thought I'd be able to do that! Thank you Ross.
Well, who cares what your Mom thinks? So you pulled a Monica.
Why don't you ask him out?
Guess what? You're almost an uncle!
Hey!
Hi Rob Dohnen.
No.
Sure. Yeah, he's kinda sexy.
Well, since the fire was kinda my fault I guess you should get to stay here.
Oh! I know! It's because... he's gorgeous, and he's charming, and when he looks at you...
All right, that makes sense. Ugh. But-Screw you I'm going first!
Well, uhm, back in my mugging days, you know, I, uhm, I worked St. Marc's Comics.
I went shopping with Monica all day, and I had a salad.
Yeah, and you have nothing to worry about 'cos they're all crap!
Oh, no.
Honey, you've got to go. What's his office number?
Je m'appelle Claude.
Okay, maybe ask this guy.
Okay, you guys. You guys I think I know what's going on here. Okay, you guys... STOP!! I know that, I know that you're acting mad because you think that it'll make it easier to leave. But deep down you're still really sad. Deep-deep down.
Okay then I don't have a choice! I have to buy that lamp!
Oh, you're no ordinary roommate are you?
Umm, is-is that because you're out of toner?
What happened to the intimate dinner party?
Yeah?
I..., a jingle? No, no-no-no, no.
All right, so, what are we supposed to call you?
No-No! You need your sleep. Night-night! Shh!
Nu-uh!
Because my psychic is dead! She must've read the cards wrong!
Me too. Rachel.
You're kidding! And he plays rugby?! That's so funny. Ohh! I see how you did that. All right.
Green Bay.
No! Why?
Oh my God! Chandler just left though!
Which one do you have?
No. No. It's just I was umm, I was with Ross and Jill after you left and umm, I'm pretty sure I saw a little spark between them.
So, so sorry.
Yeah well, she certainly knew what she was doing New Year's Eve 1997.
Oh! Oh, I can't believe it! I mean I think it's great! For him. She might be able to do better.
So you guys, I'm doing all new material tonight. I have twelve new songs about my mother's suicide, and one about a snowman.
Mhm... it's moist.
So great. Oh, we took a nap today and my Mom fell asleep on my tummy and purred.
I don't know about that. I've got one that's worse.
Joey, you can't make someone do something they don't want to do. Believe me, there's something I've been trying to get Mike to do in bed and there's... he's just...
"Ipan Stripan, Glupi Glabi! " And that is the Swedish National Anthem! Thank you for asking!
I just think that this was a really bad sign, ya know. I mean, like the beast at the threshold, you know. It's just like, I have no family left, ya know. I mean except for my grandmother, you know, but let's face it, she's not gonna be around forever, despite what she says. And I have a sister who I've barely spoken to since we like shared a womb. I don't know, this is my real father and I just, I want things to be like just right.
Have I gone deaf?
Ohh, umm, we kinda took a little detour on the way over here.
I'm too excited!
Hey!
Is it an engagement ring?
Great! Umm...
Ok, that's so nice.
Yeah, do you want to break a dying woman's heart?
Oh, how does it work?
Alright, here, you have to hold this.
Oh God, here we go. For the first time in my life I'm gonna say 'Hi birthfather'.
Hurry!
You guys, he's beautiful!
North route or south route?
Okay, Monica's are the biggest.
Insane.
I got it! Mine!
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm so rude. Does anyone want to come to the movies?
No reason! That would just be a really big surprise, right?
And, and!
There's sooo much you don't know.
What's that smile? Did something happen with you two?
Okay.
Hi, Ursula.
What were you thinking?
Ohh, that's so nice! How great! Well, where? Where's the trip?!
Your hair looks too good, I think it would upset her. Ross, why don't you come on in.
Okay, I can do that! Oh, by the way, I love my office.
What?! Oh my... Oh my God!! What happened?!
pelle.
Tell him, tell him.
Cassie, are you finding everything okay in there?
Hey, why are you mopping your ceiling?
Then keep running.
He's holding us back.
Really?
Really? Are you sure?
Yeah, y'know, people can be so self-involved.
No, don't-don't say I'm sorry with porn!
Well y'know every time that they say that like they're doing laundry we'll just give them a bunch of laundry to do.
Oh yeah?
I don't know, it's just, you know...monkeys, Darwin, you know, it's a, it's a nice story, I just think it's a little too easy.
Okay, we'll talk about something else then.
Ohh. . .K. How come?
Yeah, I know, he's sweet, but it's just not fun anymore, you know? I don't know if it's me, or his hunger strike, or, I don't know.
Ooh! How was Kathy's play?
No, I know. That's a part of the whole, you know, them-not-liking-you-extravaganza.
I know... I mugged Ross!
Oh, she's got gorgeous hair.
I'm gonna go.
Oh no.
Yeah, um, in Albany, can I have the number of Frank Buffay. . . OK, um, in Ithica. . . alright, um, Saratoga. . . Oneonta. Alright, you know what, you shouldn't call youself information.
Great! Okay, good for you!
Oh, OK, so then what is it? Some kind of... you know, like, like... some kind of, y'know, like... alright, what is it?
Sticky shoes, sticky shoes, always make me smile. Sticky shoes, sticky shoes, next time I'll.... avoid the..... pillleeeee.
You're just so mean to each other! And I don't want to end up like that with Rachel. I still like you!
Umm here's your 3-D glasses.
No. But thanks.
Does anyone wanna watch TV?
Oh.
Demi Moore.
But do you wanna get back together?
So how's your date with your cyberchick going. Ooh, hey, what is all that .
Kills you?
Yeah, I think I told it wrong. Y'know, we should talk about that because I don't totally understand what happened there.
Hey!
Yeah, she turned you into this-this-this untrusting, crazy, jealous, sycophant. All right, so I don't know what sycophant means, but the rest is right.
Oh! Hi!
Yeah! Why would my mother send me a fur? Doesn't she know me but at all! Plus, I have a perfectly fine coat that no innocent animal suffered to make!
New York City has no power, and the milk is getting sour. But to me it is not scary, 'cause I stay away from dairy.... la la la, la la, la la...
He's awfully short and I think he's talking to himself. And to be completely honest, he's not that good in bed.
Um, gram, um, can I see the pictures of my dad again?
Yeah! Ooh, we could teach them to sing, and we can be like the Von Trapp family! Only without the Nazis. Although that sounds kinda dull.
Oh no, no, no, don't stop!
Oh, I wish I could, but I don't want to.
Uh-huh. Good luck.
What if I had taken that job at Merrill Lynch?
Yeah!! Let's do that!
Eh, don't be so hard on yourself. If someone I was still in love with was getting married...
Lusts of the flesh.
Great.
Oh, yeah!
Ohh, okay maybe they put your picture back up they can put you next to Matt Lauer. Look at him, smiling at me. Yeah I know; we'd be great together!
I'm just taking it to be re-wired.
Hey.
No, he really hates it. But he's gonna let me keep my box of human hair! So you got to pick your battles. But the good news is, Gladys is yours!
Okay.
What?
I do love Mike.
Hey!
Hey.
Oh my God! I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Which one's Demi Moore?
Oh I'm kinda part of this.
Woo!
Are you the cutest?
Rachel!
Just one? I drive you all the way down here, and I don't get to see how it works out?
Of course! Yeah, I was uh, umm Thigh Mega Tampon.
Did you find it?
Okay then.
Oh!
Hey!
Huh.
Oh okay.
Isn't there a national football league.
Okay.
Ohh, Monica, I am so excited for you.
Oh my God! David!
Well look, you don't really like the one from uptown and you're too exhausted from dating the one up in Poughkeepsie, so I say you just end them both. Okay? You take a train up to Poughkeepsie and break up with her, and on your way back you break up with uptown. And then by the time you get home tonight, you're done!
Pies, oh, we thought you said priiiize . Here! .
Oh, all right. What did I have?
Ohh.
Umm, well I, I kinda had a little chat with Alice, and I sort of made her see why you two shouldn't be together, y'know. And you're gonna see it to, one day, you really, really will.
Ok, there is no top. That's the beauty of Smelly Cat. Um, why don't you just follow me?
Oh my god! Look, it's Ross and Rachel. Oh, the plan is working.
It's a funny word.
Hold me close, young Tony Dan-za.
Look David, if... if you had never left, then... yeah, we'd probably still be together right now, but... you did leave, and I-I'm with Mike and I really care about him...
Oh yeah. You know, I don't know if I was happier when um George Bailey destroyed the family business or um, Donna Reid cried, or when the mean pharmacist made his ear bleed.
Wow. Okay, I don't know how to talk to you.
What's up?
Hey!
Really?! I won!
Happy Holidays. Feliz Navidad. Allo, and Merry Christmas. Ohh thank you sir. Here's some joy.
Je m'appelle!
Well, I wanna enter her in a baby beauty pageant.
Oh! Hey, Rach!
How old is your phonebook?
Food here at 'Javu'..will kill you..the food here at 'Javu' ...will kill you.. Monica: Thank god, it's just you! I thought someone was swinging a bag of cats against the wall.
Y'know, you are 12 years older than her.
Oh now, don't give away the farm!
It's for our wedding day! Right, now, is this guy gay or straight, because one of us gonna have to start flirting.
But I can't tell you.
All right, hold on! Okay, let's just all think.
Oh, it's your audition from this morning. Can I use the phone again?
Hey.
I love Jacques Cousteau!
Whatever, it's the perfect end to the perfect weekend anyways.
Because she's your lobster.
Hey!
So how was, how was your date?
Ok, thanks. Sorry, again
My guy is well read.
No, yeah, we never find them! She's always best at us, that wily... minx.
Oh, it's incredible! I so want to be a Waxine girl.
Yeah, you never heard of them?
I think she means 'You dance a dance class'. Oh, c'mon, c'mon.
Well, a pipe was my weapon of choice and, uhm, pre-teen comic book nerds were my meat.
Oh my God! Monica's just gonna kill you.
Is it Ross? It's Ross isn't it-Oh my God, it's Joey!
I don't what your talking about.
Oh, thank you. Four would be great.
Well, okay, I made a touchdown. It was my first touchdown. So?
Fine! Okay, all right, so Jane Eyre, first of all, you'd think she's a woman, but she's not. She's a cyborg.
I-I wanted to apologise if I-y'know seemed a tad edgy yesterday at my shower. Y'know it's just the hormones, y'know.
Come on, there's gotta be something.
Okay!
We know it's a girl!
So... what do you say?
Yes!! Ohh.
We won.
Stop it! Stop it, before someone gets really hurt! Here David, you should just go.
Yeah, you're right. This is none of our business.
No thinking! No thinking! Tie or ascot?
Hey, you guys! Look what I found! Look at this! That's my Mom's writing! Look.
Central... Park!
Well, I don't care, so you pick!
What did you do on yours?
You're right.
Ok, um, we haven't known each other for that long a time, and, um, there are three things that you should know about me. One, my friends are the most important thing in my life, two, I never lie, and three, I make the best oatmeal raisin cookies in the world.
OOooooo!
I don't know. I'll just handle it-I'll ask you to talk to him!
I, but you're so close! No!
Well, I'm not going in first. I bet that vein on Monica's forehead is popping like crazy.
Oh my god, Frank, are you thinking of leaving? Because I didn't have those triplets so you could just run out on them!
Okay, so I totally took care of the babies all by myself! I fed 'em, bathed 'em, and put 'em to bed.
I've found....
Ooh, honey. You stink at lying.
Well, it was just, it was all so crazy, you know. I mean, Chandler was in the closet, counting to 10, and he was up to 7 and I hadn't found a place to hide yet. I-I-I meant to tell you, and I wrote it all down on my hand. See, all of it.
That is a different phone.
That's a bird?
If you never smoke again I'll give you seven thousand dollars!
Well he's tall.
I'm sorry, Frank. I didn't realise things were so bad. You know, I'll help out more. I can - I can babysit any time you want. You name the day, and I'll be there.
All right, ready?
Okay, thank you, Mr. Heckles.
But you-you can't leave me with them! We-we're a team! We're playing a zone! They're gonna triple team me!
Oh.
Oooh look! Isn't this adorable, Ross let Ben address mine!
Uh huh. But they're not your friends anymore.
Oh, how cute!
Joey? How could you just let them leave?
Uh-huh.
There-there was a suicide note?! Well, do you still have it?
Uh-huh, and you?
I know, I know. Hello.
Well, I was thinking...
Merci. Au revoir.
Well, how-how-how is that possible? You barely know her!
Thank you for coming everybody. There're cookies in the back.
Happy Thanksgiving!
Come on in!
Yeah, yeah. They even do you.
It's gone.
What? Oh. Ooh. Whoa! That one kept going.
Exactly! Look, no matter what I tried to do, I couldn't keep you out of my life. Of all the people I have cut out, you were the only one who ever clawed her way back in.
Chandler sucks! He couldn't have gotten this good!
So what were you doing out there, do you not like Charlie?
Oh, right!
Yeah, and maybe that you're a real
OK, let's go.
There's a skylight?! Wow!!
So that's why she gave you a naked picture of herself.
No. No! No! ...So, um, do you think he's doing any better than he was this morning?
Oh, Monica, grow up!
And I'm still waiting for my paper mache man. Thank you my babies.
Okay, I think I need to do some shopping.
I just feel so, uhh.....
Oh my God, he's not even appreciated in his own time. I would give anything to not be appreciated in my own time!
Ok, it's too hard, I can't teach you!
What?
Oh, I tasted Ben's milk, and Ross freaked out.
Oh no, let her stay out there. It's sweet.
Come on! Let us be guys! Maybe we want to be guys!
I'm just gonna pass on the concert, 'cause I'm just not in a very Hootie place right now.
Hi!
Oh, it's bad. It's really bad. The only thing in there that isn't burned is an ass. Which I do not remember buying!
Oh you did? He did it! He did it!
Well, y'know we don't call it that, but yeah!
Oh! Well, if that's what you want...
Hm-mm, corn beef.
No! No, you can't arrest me! No!! I won't go back! I won't go back to that hell hole!!
Ha-ha, it's not my baby, ha-ha-ha!
Are you crazy?
