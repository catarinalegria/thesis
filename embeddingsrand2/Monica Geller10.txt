What does the red X next to Bob Greenmore's name mean?
I called him.
Y'know, you called me that before so I-I took the liberty of fashioning a star out of aluminum foil. Now, no pressure, you like my cookies, you give me the star.
All right. But umm, I-I-I'll pay you back all the money you invested, and you can keep the van.
Yes! Have you seen it?
Oh good. Good, look I'm so sorry, for screwing up that cutting-her-out plan. But I have a new plan. Chandler agreed to call here in a few minutes with an emergency.
Oh God!
Scary pigeon's back?
Chandler, you don't wanna miss this. This is the birth of your child! It's the miracle of life!
Nothing.
