You know, I flew a long way t see my loving wife? Is she here by the way?
Yes! Ross, you have to stay!
So I have a flaw! Big deal! Like Joey's constant knuckle-cracking isn't annoying? And Ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word? And Monica, with that snort when she laughs? I mean, what the hell is that thing? ...I accept all those flaws, why can't you accept me for this?
Uch, do you think, Monica is gonna be able smell it?
He's not supposed to ask my girlfriend to marry him! I'm supposed to do that!
Actually Pheebs its more of a husband and wife kinda thing.
Hello, Joanna......'s office.
Eeeshk.
Somebody is gonna pick us.
You ah, you have, you have to leave, now? How come?
Buy stamps, pick up dry cleaning...Don't let Phoebe in.
That's really not the kind of thing we are looking for Zack.
What's going on?
A-huh. So he's rolling down the street and he starts to lose control, you know... maybe he falls... maybe hurts himself. Just then, a kid comes flying by wearing the shoes. He jumps over the old guy and laughs, and the line reads: "Not suitable for adults!"
Actually what?
All right, let's break this down. What exactly did he say to you?
Well, you couldn't get them anyway. Ian doesn't plan anymore and Derrick... And Derrick is a name I shouldn't know.
Ok, ok, you can be shirts and I'll be skins. I'll be skins. Hey, how you holdin' up there, tiger? Oh, sorry, when my parents were getting divorced I got a lot of tigers. Got a lot of champs, chiefs, sports, I even got a governor.
Guys! Guys! Come on! It's Thanksgiving, it's not important who wins or loses. The important thing is, the Dutch girl picked me! Me! Not you! Holland loves Chandler! Thank you, Amsterdam! Good night!!
Oh, I think this is the episode of Three's Company where there's some kind of misunderstanding.
Aww, turkey! Aww, giving thanks! Aww!
All right look. Penis schmenis. We're all people.
Hello sir, you know Monica.
It was a car backfire!
And! They like me more just because I was with ya! I think you repaired a lot of the damage from when they met Joey. And Doug wants us to play tennis with them. He's never even talked to me outside of work. Except for that time when we bumped into each other at that strip club. Strip church. Anyway, I'm gonna go try and find a racquet.
Just out of curiosity did she tell you how you're gonna go?
What picture?
Oh, you should live with Joey, Roll-os everywhere.
Yeah, and I don't have any cologne.
I know.
I think you played the Gunther card too soon.
Right now, right here. Don't ya think we're in kind of a public plaaaa They do have the shrimp.
Hey you guys.
Oh yeah?
Hmm, the game's at one.
No I don't! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
It doesn't matter. I just don't want to be one of those guys that's in his office until twelve o'clock at night worrying about the WENUS.
Hey Mon, I think I figured out whose handcuffs they are.
Wow, in 45 minutes you can find her twice.
Fine.
Forget about her.
I guess. It's always gonna be scary when we have a baby.
Flashdance.
She? It's a girl?
Honey, we're leaving tomorrow you've still got a lot of packing to do.
You think?
Yeah, we're gonna go.
Oh Mon-Mon-Mon-Mon-look, this is the honeymoon suite. The room expects sex. The room would be disappointed if it didn't get sex. All of the other honeymoon suites would think it was a loser.
ah-ha!
Yeah, and I don't wanna brag but a lot of the ideas were mine! Hell, you weren't there? All the ideas were mine!!!
Yes!! I love you! I can't even remember what we were fighting about!
They're never coming down now.
That is funny, maybe for my birthday she'll murder someone.
Well I was... I was exactly expecting company after... 9:15.
Oh that's great, my friend Joey's in the movie business.
Hey.
He's right, if you quit this job, you then have motivation to go after a job you really want.
Hey!
BEND OVER?!!!
Oh, that's mature.
Well, I umm, I mean this is just off the top of my head now, umm but I have this friend. This actor friend and he would kill me if he thought I was doing this umm, but umm would it be possible for him to get an audition for your movie say on Thursday?
Hi honey I'm home!
What?
Hi!
Look, I appreciate it, but uh, it's a little creepy. Y'know? I'm not a bachelor anymore.
Why did I get married?!
This is not going to work.
I can tell from your expressions that that's the good news you were hoping for... Well, I'm gonna go continue to... spread the joy.
Well okay Jerry, thanks for stopping by.
Joey was in a porno movie.
No you know I don't mind.
Ok. First of all, this is green!
We used to be married, but then we missed a weekend away together and things kind of unraveled. Because of you! Happy Birthday.
Whoa!
Ahh, do you have any coconut flavoured deities?
My duties? All right.
Looks like Joey is doing allright with her.
No, no, Ross and Rachel will be back soon and then I gotta go to the office Am I producing them?
You wouldn't know if Jeanette's planning on keeping her baby, would ya?
Oh, that would be Monica. Hey, listen, I wanna borrow a coupla things, Aurora spent the night, I really wanna make her breakfast.
Oh, uhm, okay, uhm, do you mind if we ask you some questions about the father?
That is the exact same thing.
Because it says "Captain Ross" on the side and "I hate Monica" on the bottom.
Oh Mon-Mon-Mon-Mon-look, this is the honeymoon suite. The room expects sex. The room would be disappointed if it didn't get sex. All of the other honeymoon suites would think it was a loser.
Is that Joey?! Let me talk to him!
I KNEW IT!!!!
I know it sounds really weird, but we're just so bad at relationships.
You didn't just break up.
Why?
Yeah, at least you hid your feelings well about it.
Boy did we make friends with the wrong sister!
I am so sorry. I really am. I was an idiot back then. I rushed the stage at a Wham concert for crying out loud!
People who've never ever been to Paris.
Oh, you're right I, I should play in the hay. Forget about the fact that I just dropped 400 dollars to replace a bracelet that I hated to begin with. Bring on the hay.
Before you say anything, have we got a story for you! Guess who we bumped into at dinner!
What are you guys talking about?
Yeah... Bunny-rabbit.
You guys wanna eat here?
Well, what? What? What is it? That she left you? That she likes women? That she left you for another woman that likes women?
Can you believe how lame this is?
All right, if I do this, can we at least discuss sex on the balcony?
Wow! You look amazing!
Y'know uh, I didn't actually do this.
Okay, one question.
Okay man.
I am strong! I'll show you!
Well, listen, this has been great but I'm officially wiped.
And you wonder why Ross is their favorite?
...and a street where our kids can ride their bikes and maybe an ice-cream truck can go by.
Ah, there we go.
Just practicing. You're good. Carry on.
Hey.
Sure!
Well, it's a training program, but at the end, they hire the people they like.
How did you guys find me? I knew I should've hid at the gym!
Why would I kiss a girl, and then put her on your bed?
What are you doing?
Well, what's the deal with these? These-these look nice.
What's this in my pocket? Why it's Joey's porno movie.
Uh, Rach... I think I have something that belongs to you.
I know that one! ...No, that's Popes into a Volkswagen.
Well what... Y'know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna go over there; I'm gonna kick his ass! Will you help me?!
Ok, you can not do this to me.
No-no-no-no-no!
And done!
This is so sad. I mean, I only have like ten pins.
Yeah, and I-I gave first names to all of the foosball players.
Bye.
Thanks, Phoebe. But I just don't really see myself in a big white hat.
Hey, I can be smooth. Listen, we're a little bit in a hurry, so, if you can get us a table a little quicker, I'd appreciate it.
Don't ask me, I was in there canoodling you!
Y'know, I saw a wine cellar downstairs...
For the last time no! Get out! Get out, Joey!
You're gonna put on sweats and clean, aren't you?
Hi guys!
Yes.
Oh, okay Ross. Listen, this pen is kinda getting boring, so can you pick me up some porn?
Steps! Slut! You will all be very happy to hear that Kathy is sleeping with that guy!
Thank you! All right, I gotta go unpack.
He's taking off her coat!
I can't believe you don't know what I do for a living!
I'm an alien. I'm an alien.
You kissed her that night too?
She was not good. Not good.
Well next time ask! Or at least wait for me to ask!
I just saw Janice.
Ahh, Gepeto, $5,000 dollars? Are you insane?
So uh Monica, do you, do you like the Law & Order?
I can't talk to you now, I gotta find Monica!
To Monica!
