Shhh! I want to hear the rest!
Ok, I'm gonna get my stuff.
You really think I didn't say goodbye to you because I don't care?
Well, ultimately, I was trying y'know, I-I wanted...tell him y'know, that I'm still in love with him.
Why you guys this isn't funny, all right? If I wanted this cake to be a disaster I would have baked it myself!
Yeah! Right! Okay, I'll see you guys later. Woo hoo!
Ross, I...
Okay, see? I told you!
Welcome home.
Ah, it's still not the time.
Have to make it stop!!
Hey.
Oh, but of course it is!
Oh, I don't know. Well maybe it's just the idea of Barry for the rest of my life. I don't know I think I feel like I need to have one last fling, y'know, just to sorta get it out of my system.
Here he is. Hi. Guys, this is Russ.
Monica, you don't even have a bed, you sleep in a ball on the floor!
That's great. So now, Super Gavin, when I come back where are you planning on flying off to?
A card! A card! I pick a card!
What? I-I don't.
Noo! I wish! Okay, you ready?
Ew, was Chandler naked? Sort of like a, like a ring toss kind of situation?
I think you should go.
Any chance you think the couch looks good there?
I know, so do I. Oh Phoebe, I'm so glad you made me do this. OK, lemme se yours.
Oh come on, I already went.
Oh, I guess. Except everything looks like jammies now.
Sure. I just sharpened her this morning.
Oh no-no, no-no, they don't want you to put your hands in the pockets until you are out of the store.
Shhh.
You can't, because of the new skylight!
Oh, this lipstick looks just great on you.
Ooh, I can do that.
Jill! Did you shop?!
I know Monica's worst Thanksgiving.
Have at it.
Guys, you're not gonna believe this! I was just saying goodnight to Emma and she said her first words!!
Joey! Sit down!
Hi you guys!
Oh my God.
Yeah.
The thing is y'know, that you're married to Emily.
Right,.. well,.. we never actually got to that... Oh, it was just so nice to see him again, y'know? It was comfortable, it was familiar... it was just nice!
You sure?
Well, I like you less!
Well, I haven't seen him since that night that he told me how he y'know... I don't know, I think he's avoiding me. Why is that bagel on the floor?
Because she hates Pottery Barn.
Ohh Tag, umm...you're such a great guy and we have sooo much fun together but I don't-I don't...
People are trying to sleep in here!
I'm gonna do it too!
She's ok, I just don't get a really good vibe from her!
Hey.
Ross, things aren't gonna be weird between us, right? I mean was that just the stupidest thing, me telling you that?
Okay, but Ross just listen to me...
No.
Okay, I thought it was about your neighbors liking you.
Thank you.
Y'know who I always liked? Mork.
All right, then you owe me $350.
You guys are gonna come and visit me, right?
Yeah, sure. Umm...here.
So now what have we agreed?
How?! How do you know?
Are you okay?
Joey, what-what are you doing going into my bedroom?!
Wow! I can't believe you lied to me.
Well said. And a uh good example of the fun I was referring to uhh, but I just think I'm past the point where I think I can y'know, just have fun.
Oh Phoebe, we forgot that party we have to go to.
Well, you have been in our lives for nearly two months now and we don't really know you. I mean, who is Julie? I mean, what do you like, what don't you like? We wanna hear everything.
Yeah, sure Mr. Zelner, for you anything-minute. Okay. Fine. Abort the plan, abort the plan.
What?
Yeah, that was an awesome day! Opening credits.
It's not kicking right now. Although we would love to see you do that again.
Oh, um, no, no, no, no excuse me, hello. Hi. My friend ordered an onion, not an olive, and uh I ordered a rum and Diet Coke, which I don't think this is.
Oh, but that's okay.
Oh, hey!
Okay, okay, okay, fine, I'm gonna look it up .
Ross, Chandler wrote something about me on his computer and he won't let me see.
Uh-oh.
Oh, that is so sweet. I think I'm falling in love with you all over again.
No. No, I don't. Could you be a dear and go tell him?
Oh, that's um, interesting.
Oh my God! You really are freakishly strong!
So uh, so did anything happen? Because rumor has it you guys shut the drapes!
Shall we?
Oh.
Then what's with all the bananas?
Look! This is ridiculous. We should be packing you!!
Yeah.
Okay. I'll miss you.
Hi Monica!
Yeah so get ready to hear alot of ehm...boohaki, goshdarnit and brotherpucker.
Bye-bye-e!
December 26th, huh maybe she's Santa Clause.
Let's roll!
Oh honey, I'm so sorry, you were right, this feels great!
Oh, god, I know it, that I freaked you out.
All right, you know what? This isn't funny anymore. There's something about me on that piece of paper and I want to see it.
Ooh, this is soo sweet, Joey our little twinkle-toes.
What?
What's the matter with you?
Hey, this is hollow.
Cute guys in little shorts? Sure.
Hey!
You are asking me to be your wife!
What is that noise?
Oh Pheebs, is that a new ankle bracelet?
I'm fourth! Look at you with your little maple syrup award!
Excuse me, I wanted you to help, but you couldn't move your arms because you were wearing three life jackets.
I love you.
Uh, actually, I think I'm gonna be busy.
What?
The nights are the hardest. But then the day comes! And that's every bit as hard as the night. And then the night comes again...
I'm okay.
Surprise me.
Oh no, I'm good, I don't wanna get that turkey smell all over my hands.
Well, that's because of a lot of...
What?
Nooo!
Well that sounds fun too.
Hey, Mon.
Agh, it was the graduation from hell.
Ohh, good.
Oh! You are?
And uh, he will have a white wine spritzer.
Hi you guys.
Alright! Don't get too comfortable there, because I'm back in two weeks! And I want everything back to the way it was. I can't say that I care too much for the way you've rearranged my office.
You fell asleep?!
Hi, how was the movie?
I'm gonna throw this away, but thank you so much for the gesture!
All right, all right. Let's go!
Pretty much.
Yeah! You know, ever since I had that dream about him, and can't get it out of my head! And what's the big deal, people do it all the time!
Well honey, then why don't you break up with one of them?
Oh Chandler, stop talking!
See, there's always one guy. "If I had a wish, I'd wish for three more wishes."
Well, don't look at me! My hair's straight! Straight! Straight! Straight!
It's so not a big deal!
OK, Ross, listen to me, I am not yours to save.
Agghhh.
Well, I used to date him, but you're still going out with her!
All right look lady here is the deal, I came here for an annulment and I am not leaving here until I get one!
Ooh!
We're good?
Excuse me? Oh yeah? Well, up yours too!
That was amazing. I can't even send back soup.
No, just singing.
Vrrbddy, the bll is drrbing.
I went really long.
Uh, well, I think, I think he broke up with me.
Oh, great could you make me four copies of those?
Oh, hey, don't you have to go pick up Emily?
What-what if I marry Ross-Or Joey?
Uhh... I think I just got engaged.
Well, from me. And I know it's not your big money song, but it's my favorite.
What are you going to make?
I don't know! I think it's kind of serious! Oh, you know... I was watching this thing on TV this morning about... Newcastle disease... and I think I might have it!!
Oh God, that's right. I blocked that out.
Yeah, that's probably a good idea.
No, y'know what? It's gonna be okay. I mean you don't have to have this rustic Italian feast. Y'know? And-and you don't need, you don't need this custom-made, empire waisted, duchess, satin gown; you can wear off the rack.
Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no, that's OK, I don't need them. I'm going for fours.
Thank you. What? You don't want to see this do you?
Say it!
Well okay, how about four hours in a freezing museum auditorium listening to Professor Pitstains and he's 'Hey everybody! Remember that thing that's been dead for a gazillion years. Well there's this little bone we didn't know it had!'
"...marenge, thank you honey, and do the cha-cha. And while she like to be a star, Tony always tended bar. At the, wait, wait, everybody.."
What? What? Ross, you're scaring me. What's going on?
I hate when Ross is right!
Okay.
Hey!
All right, how about I go over there and I will walk into Chandler's bedroom and I will see that thing that I think that I know is actually the thing that I think that I know!
Okay, well keep in mind that by the time you're done, they'll probably be serving dinner.
Well...
I know!
Oh! Tommy, this is Ross. Ross, Tommy.
What?
Are any of you guys free tonight? My boss is hosting this charity event for underprivileged kids and the more people I bring, the better I look. So, Monica? Chandler?
Well, Joey probably thinks I'll just embarrass him. Y'know, he thinks I'm some kind of a soap opera nut-Which I'm not! I'm not. Although I do know that your uh, your favorite ice cream flavor is butter pecan. And uh, and that your-your dog's name is Wally. Well look at that, I'm just stroking your arm.
And everybody knows this?
Phoebe you can't have both of them! You have to pick one!
Yeah honey, I'm standing right there! Why didn't you just tell him about the mole I haven't got checked yet.
No, no, no, no turtles scare me. I don't need that today.
No.
I'm so sorry.
Hi you guys.
Oh my God! Look at this!
Just get out! Now!!
WHAT?
Geez!
Yeah, I love that story. Um, I got a question for you guys. Why do people keep is saying that is good to see me up and about?
I'm gonna do it.
Yeah, 15 hundred dollars.
That is so sad. Your missing out on so much, Ross. I mean, the bonding and the sharing, you know. And-and knowing that someone else is going through the same thing you are.
Of course they're listening to you! Everybody listens to you.
Fine, I will. Alright, fill me in!
Well, it is, all right? When we were out there today, all I kept thinking was: I can't believe Chandler is screwing this woman, but MAN this would be a nice place to live!
Ahhhhh, salmon skin roll.
What?!
Oh sure.
No, no, trust, me, it's, it's, it's much better that I know. Uh, I just liked it better before it was better...
Oh, I'm fine.
She is not Rachem. What the hell's a Rachem? Is that some stupid paleontology word that I wouldn't know because I'm just a waitress.
What?
Well-well you can give them to me! I haven't felt my feet in years!
Would you let me talk.
Joey! Why did we have to rush out of there so fast?!
You're fly is open, Geller!
What? Shut up! We're winning!
Well, it was all Ross's idea.
So umm, you're gonna stay with me as long as I need you?
Now! Give him the sandwich! Give him the sandwich!
Manhattan does not have enough stores.
Well, so what does he do?
Oh great! Suddenly she sounds like a biblical whore.
I got a really incredible job offer.
Ohh! And I'm one of them!! Wow! Oh, I just cannot believe this! I mean, Joey Tribbiani!
Chandler told me.
I'm more than okay, I am really, really happy! Wanna know why?
Oh no, no-no-no, that's not, not, not, what he is doing. He's just, he's just really romantic.
You have a roommate?!
Okay?
Wait a minute!
I'm not saying that I'm a lesbian! I'm just saying that this happened!
Well I'm alone and I just bought fifteen dollars worth of candy bars, what do you think?
Mr. Treeger.
Oh.
Oh no-no, no! It's good! It's all good! I-I actually work at Ralph Lauren!
Wow! Oh, she's so nice and big! Oh, Monica, where are you going to display Gladys oh so proudly?
Mark? Oh my God!
Wow...
Yeah. That's Daddy.
Oh, no, Michael, it's not you. I'm sorry, it's just, it's this thing. It's probably not as bad as it sounds but this friend of mine is, is getting a cat with his girlfriend.
Ok. Monica?
What do you, what do you mean?
Well, y'know he lost his keys so he was looking for them...
Hey, listen umm, what-what are you doing tonight?
Oh. Amy! Happy Thanksgiving.
It's coming from Joey!
That's not the end.
Hi... I'm on a date...
Well, yeah... Okay, look it's about me and...
Now, you do realize that she's a cartoon, and way out of your league?
Would you stop?! What is the matter with you?!
I didn't see anything! I actually changed my mind about the name.
I'm sorry, that's not funny.
We were on a break!
You want me to talk you out of it?
Yeah, it's just y'know...
Oh yeah! I know.
Hi!
Oh my God! Oh my God!! That is like the third most prestigious soap opera award there is!
But I don't, hmm... Oh, who approved that order?! Well there is no Mark Robbinson in this office. Get me Mark on the phone!
Okay, uhh, I think I'm going to run to the ladies room.
What...that scene I saw was so good!
Yeah. I'm gonna have a baby. I'm gonna have a baby. I'm gonna have a baby!
Good different?
Ooh, Italian!
Well why shouldn't I?!
What?! What? What happened?!
Whoa-ho.
Do you even know who Kip is?
My God! What happened to you?
I cannot push it in!
Tah-daaah!
Ross, can you pass me the yams?
Well y'know, I don't want you to be cold.
Here you go.
Ross, look, I know that some of this stuff is out there, but I mean, come on, look at this, look at this sweater! . I mean, this is just beautiful!
Well, people are different.
Eww!
Ok. You decorate dad's office and so now you're a decorator. Okay! I went to the zoo yesterday and now I'm a koala bear.
What?! You-you actually thought that basket was gonna get you the apartment?
Oh, Ross, c'mon. It's my fault, I almost lost your...
Well, oh, Mark, I'm doing this for the wrong reasons, y'know? I'm just doing it to get back at Ross. I'm sorry, it's not very fair to you.
Yeah, don't push it though.
Well, so then what are you doing to me? Okay? Just get out of here! All right? Move on!
Ah! Well it was Joey reading Drake's lines in the dream...
Yeah! You can hook it up to your TV and you get radio!
No! I mean come on! This is a huge deal! Fine I want-I need more details, who-who initiated the first kiss?
Oh sure Ross, yeah. If I have a heart attack in a restaurant, I want you there with your fossil brush.
Is he romantic with her?
What?!
No! You guys can't leave yet! You have to stay, we-we got the whole big thing planned!
Oh, Phoebe, do I wanna hear this?
Uuuh!! How about at a Footlocker?
Oh, no problem. You can borrow it, by the way. Here are your keys, hon.
Ok, that's true. That's true, we can do this. You're right, you're right, we can do this. We're just gonna power through!
Barry?!
We're waiting for you to open the door. You got the keys.
Well lets see. Maybe he knows where Ross is. Hey, how's it going .
Oh my God... What.. What are you guys doing here?
Hi Dr. Long, how are you?
That's great, great. So do you have any questions for us?
Well, this is going well.
Hi...
Well then honey, buy the lamp! Hey, we have that 60 bucks from Ross.
We need a hat..
Yes!
No! Wait! No, no. Don't do that! That's going to make them think they can come over here.
Ooh! Look! Look! Look! Look, there's Joey's picture! This is so exciting!
Hey. Whe-ell, look at you, finally got that time machine workin' huh?
Don't worry, we're just gonna search here for an hour, and then we're gonna go over to Joey's and search, OK?
Because, uh-it has to.
Well there's an idea!!
All right Ross!! I get it!!
Hi. Hey, hi! So uh, Frank and Alice wanted me to tell you that they're still outside making phone calls.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You're right, you are a tough guy. You're the toughest palaeontologist I know.
Nothing.
Sophisticated like a hooker?
Ow!
Oh! Look what happened! {Don't get your hopes up guys, we only get to see her from the back or from the neck up. Its times like these I wish that the networks would broadcast some nudity other than Denis Franz's butt.} Huh, check me out! I'm in my kitchen...naked! I'm picking up an orange. I'm naked! Lighting the candles, naked, and carefully.
Ohh, well you got 'em.
Ugh.
Is Monica around? I-I have to ask her something.
Oh.
We love you, we're here for you.
Well, they always called.
Oh my God. Can you imagine if there was?! I mean, what would happen exactly.
Men are unbelievable.
What? Come on, you do what you want to do. Do we always have to do everything together?
Ohhh...
Surprise!!!
Yes! That I know, this is from White Plains.
Okay.
God, the first time he smiled at me... those three seconds were more exciting than three weeks in Bermuda with Barry.
You seem to really like her.
Hey!
Okay. You too. And I hope you score. Bye.
Okay. Oh...
Chandler, you have an assistant right?
Yeah!
Well, I just checked our messages and Joshua didn't call. I mean you'd think he'd be worried about me not showing up at his club. Ugh, you know what makes it so much worse, Ross is all happy in Vermont!
Everybody, this is Paolo. Paolo, I want you to meet my friends. This is Monica.
We hate that guy.
Hi! Oh, how was your date last night?
Are you seein her again tonight?
: Really? : Sure, we have scones left! : OK, read them to me.
Oh my God.
Who is it?
Oh, what do you, you want me to stop seeing him, is that what you want?
Well this is romantic!
Ok, careful.
Yes, I do.
Okay. Okay. Joey, it's okay. Settle down.
Yeah.
Right.
I knew it! I knew it, ahh....
Hey!
Late thirties? Oh come on you guys! Is it just me? Am I overreacting to this?
Hi!
This is ridiculous! I...
I don't gossip!
Oh, it's a Macy's bag!
Yeah.
Oh I know. I know.
Ok.
What? You just click when they click.
Now, now the one in the feather boa, that's Dr. Francis. Now, she used to be a man. Okay, now look, see, there's Raven. We hate her. We're glad she's dying. Okay- Wh- wh- Marcel, are you playing with Monica's shoes? You know you're not supposed to pl- whoah. Marcel, did you poo in the shoe? Marcel, bad monkey! Oh! Oh! Sorry, Barry. Little engagement gift. I'm sure you didn't register for that. Who died? Who died? Roll him over! Oh, c'mon, roll him over! Oh...! Well, we know it wasn't Dexter, right Marcel? Because- Marcel? Marc-
I'm gonna do it.
She didn't hang up either!
Joey, you're so sweet.
Honey, I'm sorry, but he's right. I love you, but you're crazy.
Okay... Hey listen, just before you go I-I again, I just wanna say "thank you" for coming with me.
No, but you know what I mean.
Well, there's a kiss that he won't forget for a couple of hours, y'know.
...see I can't decide whether it would go better next to the new wicker dining chair, the Sahara desk, or the Parker console table.
And you are a very funny clown.
That's your whole name, okay of course it is! Okay, well let's-let's just have a look-see here.
Great!! That's great!
Oh no, I can't tell you until you tell me what you know.
Hello! Here we go!
Really? But I'm being so unreasonable.
Ohh... I mean two best friends falling in love, how often does that happen?
Y'know, it is not like I did this on purpose.
Hi! Hey, listen, can we ask you a question? When you and Monica first hooked up, was it weird going from friends to... more than that?
Oh, wait Ross! I'm sorry, one more thing!
Really?
Shh!
It was like months ago. We were walking by this antique store, and I saw this pin in the window, and I told him it was just like one my grandmother had when I was a little girl. Oh! I can't believe he remembered!
Now Joey remember, if you win you have to hug me! You hug me!
Thank you.
Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, this is so stupid! I mean, I gave Barry up, right? I should be happy for them! I am, I'm happy for them.
Oh, sorry.
Oh yeah, sorry. Wait honey, so what did you do that made dad cut you off?
All right... Oh, Emma loves him!
Okay. Uhh, Ross, y'know what, there's something that I-that I have to talk to you about and everybody's saying that I shouldn't tell you, but I think they're wrong. I mean, and you know how people can be wrong.
Joey, I really don't...
True story.
Oh that's all right! Y'know, I ended up having a really good time. Y'know, the charity was a big success and they raised a lot of money and awareness.
Oh, thanks. So, uh, what are you gonna do this summer?
I don't have any issues with my Father.
Oh no, I think I'm gonna go home and eat ten candy bars.
Hi!
Really? You think that's all it is?
Hey, wait a minute! That is my sock!
Okay, here we go.
Oh my God!
Yeah, umm, no honey.
You look so beautiful.
Hi! Uhh, do you guys have plans for the weekend? Because I have my sister on hold, and she said that we could use her cabin for the weekend and go skiing. Huh? I'm asking you first, right?!. I mean I'm playing by the rules.
Look!
Joey, the new chair will be here in an hour. Maybe we should actually move Rosita out of here. Y'know, start the heeling process?
Hey! Everybody hide! Hide! I saw her! She's coming!
Look, this is not that big of a deal! You just don't date Ross! There's a million other guys out there, you just...
Look, I am so...so happy for you guys, but you getting married just reminds me of the fact that I'm not. I'm not even close. And I don't know, maybe I just wanted to make myself feel better. And I know that that's dumb, but oh my God you were so depressed when Ross got married that you slept with Chandler!
Oh there is no way.
He offered me one.
And if it's a girl?
Ugh, the worse day! Y'know, you think you're making progress at work and then your boss calls you Raquel.
I uh, I have two tickets to the Knicks game tonight if you're interested, just as a thank you for this week.
Yay!
Oh yeah, there you go.
Oh please, theyve been going out a week. They havent even slept together yet, I mean, thats not serious.
You want me to see a therapist?
Y'know, you should never be allowed to talk to people!
You get your messages!
what, how do we know, we never slept with you.
It happened! I am telling you it happened!
Okay look, let me paint you a little picture. All right, you are settin' sail up the Hudson! You've got the wind in your h--arms! You-you get all that peace and quiet that you've always wanted! You get back to nature! You can go fishin'! You can-ooh, you can get one of those little hats and have people call you captain, and then when you're old, Cappy.
Okay. Y'know what? I'd have to say I really don't care for your tone. And this is not the only hospital in this city and we have no problem to-Whoa! Oh gosh! Whoa!
Well, sure, but they might think it's kinda weird considering I don't work there anymore.
Here is a book of poetry that I know Monica loves. And-and ohh God this is funny, look, this is a picture of one Halloween where she dressed up as a bride. And look, she made me carry her train, which was weird because I was Wonder Woman. Oh and here's a little purse that I found. Y'know I just thought that maybe they could hold the rings in there.
Well, for your information, Paolo is gonna be in Rome this New Year, so I'll be just as pathetic as the rest of you.
What? What? He's interested in you. He-he likes your hair, he just wants to know how you got here.
Take it like a man, Ross!
Right. Wow!
Oh, yeah, sure. I mean, like in the case of this young woman, she has lost her clothes, so she rides naked on the horse, she's crying out, 'Where are they, where are they?'
OK!
Right, you, you only had a year. We only hung out every night.
Oh no!!!! Oh my God!! This is all making so much sense to me now! This is why Adam Carter wouldn't go out with me! This is why Billy Tratt would just stay in this region!
Oh! Emma might like what?
And you were at this job for four years?
Okay. What the hell was that? You know what? Don't answer me. I have a date with Danny.
God, you have to tell me what happens tomorrow!
Yah, I'll have the soup and the salmon.
Yeah! I'm a big fan! Of the movies, you know. Motion pictures. The Talkies!
You're hurt!
No!
Well, I never thought I'd say this, but I'm gonna go use Ugly Naked Guy's bathroom.
Y'know, I know it's totally superficial and we have absolutely nothing in common, and we don't even speak the same language but Goooooooddddddd....
He even offered to meet me for lunch tomorrow to prep me for it.
Oh, well okay. Well, there you go.
Oh, well, I...It's kind of weird talking to you about this, but...
Oh, yeah, well... Yeah, no use wasting this baby, just lyin' around the house.
Yeah, right.
Well?
Oh, come on! He's glad that I came, he doesn't want me to go anywhere, balls flying all over the place!
And hey! Just so you know, it's not that common! It doesn't happen to every guy! And it is a big deal!!
What?
Oh, The Velveteen Rabbit! Oh my God, when the boy's love makes the rabbit real!
Hi!
Oh, everything went great.
That is totally different for two reasons. One - I didn't know that you knew that. And two, I wasn't some creep staring at his ass, we had a deap meaningful relationship.
Are you serious?! Chandler, we ate an entire cheesecake two days ago and you want more?
Sure.
Ohhh, yeah, me too.
Ok... "Emma just said gleba"!
Here.
So I'm thinking about you. So what?
Let me, let me get you some wine!
That's all right. I mean hard is it to get a couple drinks right, huh?
Uh-huh.
Hey.
Oh, y'know what, I didn't want cinnamon on this.
Yeah that works.
Okay, I'm sorry.
Because! Because I was sad.
Irrational, huh? All right, well, I'll remember that the next time you freak out about a spider in your apartment!
Yeah. Yeah, I-I-I see the scare. Listen, Paul, I think this is really great that-that y'know, you shared your feelings. It's really, it's beautiful, but umm, what do you say we go share some food?
Okay Monica, did you know about this?!
At the Copa, Copa Cabana The hottest spot north of Havana. At the Copa, Coo-pa Ca-ban-a, music and fashion were always the passion, at the Copa....
Oh wow. Why don't we just take me and put me with a Manhattan in my hand, talking to the cute bartender. These pins aren't for playing are they?
Wow! I can't, I can't feel my hands.
Then what's gonna happen?
Really?!
No not that. I kissed Gavin last night.
Well just ask Mona to give it back!
Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, why are we so sure that this is a girl?
Well neither do I!
But Pheebs, y'know you earned it.
Oh God! Y'know what I wish? I wish you were six years older. Well actually, if I'm wishin' for stuff, I actually wish I was six years younger.
Really?
Oh he's dusting me with a fossil brush. He thought it would be funny.
Yeah. Just, if it's possible, could you leave him somewhere and go have sex with another guy?
Well, there was a disaster in shipping and I've got to get this order in. Honey, I'm so sorry, but it looks like I'm gonna be here all night.
Um, everyone?
What?! My mom's not gonna be here?!
No Mon, you want to put them in concentric circles. I want to do this.
Hi! You guys, the car-service just got here. I can't believe they're not home yet! I have to catch my stupid plane. I wanna see the baby!
You're welcome.
No. I just need to be by myself for a while, you know? I just got to figure out what I want
Yeah! Remember I got that uh, gala.
Okay.
I don't know. Do I have to decide right now?
Hey, do you believe this? Do you believe they are actually getting married?
You!
You know what? I don't want to be with them either, but it's Thanksgiving and we should not want to be together, together.
You remember when we got these?
I don't care! I wanna meet this guy who's the best sex she ever had!
Oh.
I know, I can do more than cook.
I didn't know you could get married here.
Say more things like that.
Yes, okay, oh, by the way, I just gotta say, I think it's really nice of you that even after you've moved, you still keep storing that stuff for Joey!
So, will you talk to him?
I don't know, I just kinda ran into him last night.
Yeah, yeah, you go talk to your friend. You tell him, "Nice try."
Hey you!
Well, this sounds like fun! Well, you know what? Actually? People are getting a little antsy waiting Emma to wake up from her nap, so would you mind performing them once now?
Well...
Oh, oh, oh, I'll get 'Rainy Day Bear'!!
...if you tell me, I might do it.
Joanna, this is my friend Chandler Bing Joanna.
I'm hoping that if she hears it enough it will be her first word.
uh-huh.
Well, it's about time.
Ohhhh!
Oh, right, that's me!
Bye Mon.
: So basically, you get your ya-yas by taking money from all of your friends.
Well umm, maybe we could uhh... Ah-ha! Too slow!!
Uh-hmm.
Hey!
Arghh!!
Ohh, so no sign of Emily huh?
Ohh, ohh.
Phoebe the father is not here okay? I haven't told him yet and I don't think I can tell him at all now!
Uh well, uh this is a silent auction. They lay out all the stuff here and then you write down your offer and then the highest bid gets it.
Yeah. And y'know who should've shut their drapes? Is that perverted old couple two doors over.
I know, I remember that!
Well don't-What happened to Jessica's body?!
... Ok, who is this?
Oh god.
Y'know what, I want you to leave! Get outta here!
Ooh! Y'know what? If we made reservations, we could have unagi in about a half-hour.
Mom, would you relax. That was 10 blocks from here and, the, the woman was walking alone at night, I would never do that. Mom, c'mon, stop worrying. This is a safe street, this is a safe building, there's nothing OH MY GOOOD, oh my God, oh I gotta go, I gotta go, I gotta go. OK, that's fine, you just read the paper, I'm gonna get a pot, it's not for you. OK, that's fine, read the Family Circus, enjoy the gentle comedy. Aaahh, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, aaaaahh. It's open you guys.
What? What, do you mean you're not feeling well? What do you have? Is it Rubella? Because don't go near Emma, she has not had that shot.
I'm so sorry.
Oh!
Pheebs, that's for men!
Monica! I couldn't find him for two hours! He was having sex with Amy Welch!
Let's go to lunch.
Oh.
Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. Maybe it's not so bad. How did you leave it?
Ross, you are so pathetic. Why can't your son just play with his doll?
Oh my God! Did you check your entire desk! Did you check all the drawers!
Oh Phoebe!
Why? Seriously I did not understand a word that you said.
Yes.
Open it! Open it! Open it!
I do not know what's wrong with us, I mean, we have kissed before and that's been great! But this time it was leading somewhere and I was very aware of the fact that it was Joey touching me.
Oh, I'm sorry.
No, there is no Rachel Greep, but then this other girl overheard us and she was all, "I'm Rachel Greep! I'm Rachel Greep!" and he let her right in.
Is Ross here?
Yes! Totally!
BACK OFF!!! Get up! Get up! Get up! God damn it! Get up, get up, get up, get up, get up!!
Terry, I, I, I know that I haven't worked here very long, but I was wondering, do you think it would be possible if I got a $100 advance in my salary?
Ross, Joey is not here.
Hey uhm, do you remember that one really great time...?
Hi Tag! What are you doing here?
Oh no, I can't. I got a date.
What?! She just called and said that she was gonna be working late! She keeps lying to me! That's it! Y'know what? I'm just gonna go over there and confront them right now!
Well, I didn't get the job at Gucci and I got fired from Ralph Lauren.
Hi!
Monica, what are you doing?
No sorry hon, Monica's orders.
Oh screw her, that part is mine!
Oh, Pheebs, Pheebs...
Ross, didn't you say that there was an elevator in here?
Oh Joey, I'm hardly a...
Did you just say Hi, Jew?
Oh my God.
No way. No way did you do this.
Can somebody please go in?
Y'know when I locked myself in the bathroom at my wedding, it was because I was trying to pop the window out of the frame.
Bathroom's up there.
I need some milk.
Yeah.
Huh ha ha!
Okay. Hang up! That's it! Come on!
Oh, please, you wanted to get caught.
Yes!
OK, I'm doin' it for ya.
Hey, Mon, I was just doing the dishes!
Uh-huh, I get it, smoke, chimney, chimney sweep, very funny, ha-ha.
Meeting Julie.
Yeah.
Oh no. I mean it. After what just happened, I'm never leaving her again.
Thanks.
Yes.
Oh that's so cute: Ross and Mike's first date. Is that going to be awkward? I mean, what are you guys going to talk about?
What?!
And there's marketing...
Oh, I win! He's got Barney's on his speed dial.
Oh-oh! Okay, she's kicking!
Oh, maybe that's Emily calling back to leave the exact same message.
What?!
You guys, you're never gonna believe what I just found tacked up on a telephone pole! Look kinda familiar?
Yeah?
I was just going to say that I left my keys.
Hi!
No, it's okay, you didn't know.
Oh, my God!
30 seconds, okay.
Hey!
You shut up!
Well wait a minute, what happened to Days of Our Lives?
Yeah that would really be great.
Good ones?
We can't. We're not pharmacists!
Oh, it is so unfair. It's like that time they promoted Sandra over me at work.
Oh, good point.
Well look, if you don't like this...
Uh... November?
Seriously Pheebs, it's not gonna be that kind of a party.
Well, I do, but you're just gonna have to actually look at this as more of an investment than a cat.
Yeah, you know what we should all do? We should play that game where everyone says one thing that they're thankful for.
Oh, that must be it.
Well forget it, I'm not telling that girl anything. That is not my responsibility.
Well actually thanks, but I think I'm just gonna hang out here tonight. It's been kinda a long day.
Great.
Well, so what're you gonna do?
Oh wow, uh okay, uh maybe. Umm, yes, I can do that!
Monica, number one, I don't think Ben understands the concept of bribery, and number two, I... What?!
Well, so, now, do you guys have a lot of big plans?
No. Oh, oh, I guess it would be different if I were- with somebody.
Well that's his last name.
No! No Joey! U-N-I-sex.
Anybody! You, me, you know, Monica's mom...
You guys are really right...there aren't you?
Yeah.
Well, you were pretty damn good.
All right. Be sexy.
Something to do with numbers?
Oh they are nice. We-we custom-make tuxedos for celebrities and then when they're done with them they just send 'em back.
Ok, we're still on that.
All right, easy mimey, the moment has passed, it ain't gonna happen!
That proposal, at the planetarium...
Really?
They're in a caaar...
Surprise!!
Hello, Mrs. Chatracus.
Okay! Check it out!
Yeah that seems fair. We never use them.
Hi!
Ohh-ha-ha!
Because he's stealing from me!
Oh, thank you so much for coming. Ross, get in here!
Hey!
You would think!
I gotta go!
Alright, Monica, I want you to have the first taste.
Alright...
No. But she did give us some ideas on how to induce labor.
Right, I'll see you guys later...
Oh ok.
Oh, Ross...
We won't?
I'm training to be better at a job that I hate, my life officially sucks.
Gone! I mean its amazing Pheebs. I feel so free and so graceful. Hey! Look out for the horse! Sorry!
Up!
I don't know. We were watching TV, and then he pooped in Monica's shoe-
Yeah. Gotcha.
Little village people.
Oh honey thank God you're home, I was getting worried.
No-no! Don't dance for me! Please? Don't! What is the matter with you guys?
Who's this from?
That's your, that's your dad's bedroom. That's your dad's bedroom!
You're welcome.
No, I have all of the good words. OK, fine, fine, we can switch.
Oh God. Oh I can't believe Joey Tribbiani heard me throw up!
I don't know.
Oh I don't know honey. It's gonna be really late.
Oh, please, Monica. You've always hated my lamp, and then, all of a sudden, it's just magically broken?
Assistant buyer. Oh! I would be shopping... for a living!
Okay, don't listen to him. Please?
"I'm Monica, I don't get phone messages from interesting people. Ever!"
Well maybe it would make me feel better if I slept with Joey.
Did you talk to him?
Hey.
Op, op, car! Car!! Ugh!!!
Yes. Yes I do.
Phoebe?
That's funny.
Yeah! You and that girl from that copy place, which yesterday you took full responsibility for!!
Ohhhhhhhh God.
Uh... You didn't propose to me, Chandler didn't propose to me, but Joey did.
Ok, well Monica, suppose one of your "special" tickets win? How are you gonna feel when you win the lottery and you lose all your friends?
I think I am.
Well, what's the other thing, what do I think?
Oh! Whoops! I'm sorry, you were talking about Emily!
What?!
You know Pheebs, when I was little, on my birthday, my daddy would hide a present in every room of the house, and then he would draw a treasure map to help me find 'em all.
This time it's not so funny.
Oh my God!
Oh, Kim, Hi.
No! All right?! I did not see the bird! I did not see the fish! I did not see the piece of Styrofoam that was shaped like Mike Tyson! I did not, because I was trying to teach you how to sail a boat! Which obviously is an impossible thing to do!
Yeah. Hi Mark!
Emmm. Now, instead of the vegetables, is there anyway I can substitute the three-pound lobster?
Yeah, he thought he broke your chair so he switched the chairs!
Oh. Yes! I would so move out!
Uh no, he's not. Can I take a message?
And do you remember going into my purse and stealing the phone?!
Ohh, out, oh God, I don't know why we didn't think to check there!
Okay, two things didn't happen. Remember I told you that someone made out with Ralph Lauren in the copy room? Well, it turns out that's not true.
Maybe she hasn't really thought it through that well.
Okay, well, that's one less thing we have to do on Monday.
I can imagine you in a short plaid skirt and knee socks.
Yeah, right, he almost danced me right down that...garbage chute.
Yes it is! It is true! I went, I went after Ross in stupid London.
Yes, you have to get her something, and it should be something really nice.
Hi!
Oh Amy, don't cry Amy. Um.. Ross, could I talk to you in private?
Okay honey, you can finish this later we're gonna be late. We gotta go.
Ok mom, you know what, fine, I'll make an appointment ok, but you know what, right now, I gotta go, I gotta go do a thing.
I have it, I have it, I have it. Oh, okay, I can't find it, but I remember that I was in seat 32C, because that's my bra-size.
Can I talk to you alone for a minute?
Oh, I'm sorry, did my back hurt your knife?
Well, y'know what, no, you do not make my decisions because y'know what, you're fired.
It won't come off!
Really? What's that like?
What?!
Well, my boss was at the same restaurant where I was having my interview and he heard everything. So later he calls me to his office and he tells me that he's gonna have to let me go, because I'm not a team player. And I said "Wait a minute! Yes I am." and I had to sit there for 45 minutes while he proved that that in fact... was true.
OK.
Ohh! Thank God! Where was it?
Really?
Hey! Oh my God you're here, let me see your hand!!
No!
Oh my God. Did you talk to him?
What?!
Can you not look at me when I say this? I thought that if I could get you here, I could seduce you.
Okay.
Sweety, I gotta tell ya... it sounds a little bit like you like the apartment more than you like...
They made you head of the department!
Well, if it makes you feel any better, I wish my date hadn't shown up.
No! They are mine!
Popular.
Daddy, I just... I can't marry him! I'm sorry. I just don't love him. Well, it matters to me!
Good luck.
Does it still hurt?
Hi. What are you doing here? Isn't this against the rules?
Oh! Yay! Look! There's a piece that doesn't have floor on it!
No, I think it's very obvious who's wrong here.
Yeah, otherwise I'm not going.
I was gonna give you a chance to apologise to me.
But, they're across the hall! I mean that's two doors away, it would take them a long time to peck their way back over here.
No! No, she's-She was nice. I mean, she's a little slutty, but who isn't?
Okay, that doesn't help me, because we went to the same high school.
Are you okay?
Come on, it's a hypnosis tape. This woman at work used it for two weeks straight and she hasn't smoked since.
Emma! See? I don't want it.
Yeah, kicking a guy in the crotch all morning really takes it out of ya!
Yeah, when I was in the bathroom I saw the window that I crawled out of at my wedding, and God, I just started thinking that I shouldn't be here, you know I shouldn't, people are going to be looking at me and judging me and, and thinking about the last time.
You are never going to believe what happened to me today.
You went shopping?! What, and then you just came in here and paraded it right under Jill's nose when you know she's trying to quit. Wow, you guys are terrible!
What's this?
Hi! You're back from your date!
Honey, it's so sweet that you want me to stay, but I-I can't do that to you. I mean it would disrupt your entire life.
I've never interviewed anyone before. I've actually never had anyone work for me before. Although when I was a kid, we did have a maid, but this is-this isn't the same thing.
Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. See Phoebe, Phoebe.
Oh wow. Are you in trouble.
Marcel?
Hey, Ross!!! I told you I don't!
Yeah. Uh-huh, I guess it is pretty big news.
Uh! It's horrible!
Oh that's so great, now Emma has two Hugsy's.
The fear?
Well yeah, but then I remembered I started it and there was this pep rally and I was, I was on top of the pyramid but anyway-umm, what is this book about?
Yeah!
Well... he happens to be a very nice... guy....
I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love- and that'd be it? ..Ross?
Well, that's a lot better than Ross trying to kiss me in High School, and saying that he did it because he needed chapstick.
Hi. I'm back.
I know.
All right, I took them. But I figured it would be okay because you got a big ink stain on the crotch.
No, I was ten. I just developed early.
Ya know, I mean this is supposed to be a joyous occasion. My sister's graduating from college, nobody thought she would. It's a true testament to what a girl from long island would do for a Celica.
Oh God, oh God, it's sowed on though.
What? You really think she's hot?
Bye!
Yeah. Sure.
Yeah!
I know. I know. I've feeling.
I think it is.
...medium...hmm...any cookies left?
You don't know?!
You are. Well, um... We, we, we were just... Wow!
Oh, I beg to differ. The Pictionary incident?
Honey, I don't know how to tell you this, but um, if something were to happen to Ross or to myself um you wouldn't get the baby.
That's because he's on your neck.
All right!
Okay please tell me that this is just one of your jokes that you do that I don't get.
Okay.
I'm just going to grab the phone.
What?
Oh, my god.
What are you shushing?
Rock-paper-scissors?
Joey?!
Uh-huh. I know. It was just, it was just the perfect way to say goodbye.
Hmm. Do you think-Could you tell me if she's hanging in, in a one bedroom or a two?
Seriously, it's moving!
'Cos I was gonna say there's no way you could've done the end the way you guys did it back then!
Well, I'd have to say gay.
Me?!
Phoebe hates Pottery Barn?!
Oh wow.
Hi!
Ohh, well, isn't that just lovely. That's something the two of you will be able to enjoy for a really, really, really, really, really long time.
I am not a pushover!
Oh, that is so tacky.
No, you're right, you are absolutely right. I mean that makes, that makes everything different.
Arghhhh!!!!!!
No.
OK, listen, I'm sorry about last night and I really want to make it up to you.
Yeah.
Well, if it makes you feel any better, I made a fool out of myself.
It's left sweetie, but that's okay sweetie, that's a tough one.
I don't care, I'm not going anywhere.
...Jack from downstairs?
Your fly is open, Geller.
Uh-huh! Nice try, but you don't get that chair anymore! All right? That is my chair now! You can sit on my lap! No I take that back!
Oh, could somebody give me a hand with this zipper?
Okay fine, what do you have?
Whoa, that Diet Coke just went straight to my head! Woo!
Oh, why do you even bother? I already ruined her first birthday... And do you know how important these early experiences are Ross? Very! According to the back cover of that book that you gave me.
How-how did end up in Vermont with that awful witch?!
Well, hey! How about right above the TV? . That way, it will be the first thing that you see when you walk in the door!
Oh!
Wow, everything looks so good! I think I'm gonna have the chicken.
Yeah, and Lennart Haze is starring in it.
These are, these aren't for you. These are for you. Welcome to our country.
Yeah, sure. All right, whose court is the ball in now?
"Ooo," what?
Whoa! I can't believe you did that. That was really sweet.
I know you did. I'm just gonna deal with it, I'm just gonna deal with it. I gotta get out of here.
No, that's David.
Maybe, but shouldn't we wait for Chandler?
No, it's been three nights in a row.
Well, what are you guys doing tomorrow night?
Okay. So these signals Ross, explain this to me, 'cause maybe I need to be more careful. I mean, am I sending you these signals right now?
Jill this is not about me being jealous of you! This is about you being a brat! Wanting what you can't have!
All right!!
Oh, no-no-no, no-no-no, it has become, it has-yeah. Oh no, those were four great dates.
Wow! I don't remember him. Honey, are you sure you're not talking about your imaginary boyfriend.
This is such a great party! 35 years. Very impressive, do you guys have any pearls of wisdom?
Oh we just-we drove each other crazy!
Both of them are here, both of them, both of them are here?
Nothing! Oh God, we're just so excited that you want to get this apartment!
What's that?
Oh no-no-no-no-no, no, no! We, you with someone and me with someone.
I don't like sitting up here! I'm just gonna over...
Or maybe you would see me looking embarrassed because you are talking on the phone with your crotch!
You're out of Diet Coke.
Yeah, he dumped me. He said, "Rachel, I can't do this. Even though you are a very, very, very beautiful woman. I can't do this. I'm married and I'm sorry." And then I don't know why but he said, "and you will never get promoted. Especially not above Kim, who is an integral cog in the Ralph Lauren machine."
Oh my God! Oh my God!!
Yes! And I know what looks sexy on guys. Please, just wear what I suggest, and she's gonna go nuts for you.
Thank God. Food.
I can't believe I ever even tried to help you. You are so beyond help.
Gotta go! Hi! Wow! There you go!
Oh, me too.
Yeah, well, it's a Mercedes if I move back home. Oh, it was horrible. He called me young lady.
What if I clean your bathroom for a month?
Off to see young Ethan?
Yeah. Who's workin' for you babe?
He's perfect, he's never been better.
I'm thinkin' no.
Oh, okay, not so weird.
Ross, I have been walking around like this since the plane! I can-you have so crossed a line.
Well maybe she and her friends are just having a contest to see who can bring home the biggest geek.
Wow! Spinning that sounds like fun.
I know.
Hi! Are you ready? We're gonna be late!
I'm not moving! Is that picture straight?
Men just take out wind?
Oh, Ross, c'mon, please! Don't make this harder than it already is!
Yeah! But I don't know what he looks like!
I'm fine! I'm fine! I'm just losing a tooth, it's no big deal. I have a dentist! Y'know. I'm gonna go put some ice on it. Excuse me. What do I do now? What do I do now?
The bll is drrbing!
Um, hum.
Oh, yeah, yeah. Actually, I got the extended disco version, with three choruses of "You'll never make it on your own".
There it is.
What, so I can't lokk nice? There might be doctors there.
Oh, hey, Mona!
Oh. Oh, right.
Oh God. Ross, OK, if you care about me at all, you will get the pie out of the man's hood.
Wha... forget it Ross, no, I am not gonna stand here and make a list of. . .
Well then you just must have a natural talent for it.
Oh, I gotta get my ticket!
Phoebe, your in pain, would you just go to the dentist, just go.
All right, now don't judge me. I normally wait until my date leaves, but you live here. I'm ripping into this swan.
You what?
Yeah, but she also invited you and Ross. Yeah, honey, I'm sorry, but I don't think that was a romantic thing.
Yeah, I'm not so sure you should be here when he comes up.
Hey Pheebs, you're still alive! How are you doing?
Ross! Janice?!
And um, what-what is that Ross?
Yeah? Okay! Good, good, because he's coming. He's coming. Hey, what's up?
All right, I'm outta here!
Well, I didn't know what else to do!
Okay. Thank you. That's great. Thank you. Wait-wait! Where on west 10th? Because there's this really cute shoe store that has like this little...
It's not a big deal!
Umm, I think he's still out. What's wrong?
Okay. Okay, see? I get the phone.
It's Robert Bobby.
What?
It's not a big deal!
Ross, tonight was about the two of you getting along. Oh, would you just see my chiropractor, already.
Really? How good?
There you go!
Hey Chandler. Monica just broke my seashell lamp.
Ross, you don't even have oven mitts on!
Because!
She's yours!
Oh my God! Are you serious?!
Got a job on a river boat?
As I was saying... I should probably have the first of the three kids by the time I'm 35 which gives me five years. I love this plan! I wanna marry this plan!
And all these people actually died?
N-it wasn't easy, but it's your birthday and I did what I got to do.
Okay.
I don't know! Maybe they have tools.
Yeah, and-and-and by someone, she means Joey.
C'mon up.
I'm sorry.
Hey.
You should find out what his hobbies are and then use that to bond with him. Yeah! Like if I would strike up a conversation about say umm, sandwiches. Or uh, or my underwear.
Okay, very cute braces. Anyway y'know what, the point is Tag, start looking because you are going to find those contracts on your desk.
Yeah it's umm... Yeah it's uh... It-it's y'know-It's nothing.
I'm sorry, this sounds like something I'm never gonna be interested in.
What, what's it, what's going on?
Oh, making it worse!
Okay. Thank you.
Obviously you know how to haggle, so I'm not gonna try and take you on. Okay? So $800 and I don't call the cops because you're robbing me blind! Blind! Just take cat, leave the money, and run away! Run away! Damnit! Cat, can't you at least smile or something?! Okay, did anybody just hear that? Anybody?
Wait a minute. Do you not like all dogs? I mean, not even puppies?
Sure, but come on, as big as your wedding?
Oh please, he'll be with his real family, the twins and little miss new boobs.
Phoebe no!
Yeah.
Y'know, I gotta tell ya, this really does put in a better mood.
Really!
Or...I could call in sick and not deal with it at all...
Ok. That's fine.
You don't?!
Ross, I didn't think it would that big of a deal.
No, it's just that uhm... it feels so good... Ikea... Yeah, say hey, you'll know this, what's the capital of Sweden?
Okay, gotta go! Wish me luck!
Oh my God! Oh Monica! Those boots are amazing!
You know what else I'm not gonna miss? "I'm Monica. I wash the toilet 17 times a day. Even if people are on it!"
Joey no, this is wrong! You have to take it back, okay? You don't want to win an award this way. You're very talented. And someday you're gonna win one of these for real and that one is gonna mean something.
Ewwww!!
Oh, stop that! Don't kid about that! Will all the stars be there?
No.
So uh, Pheebs, honey, how are those mood swings coming?
Oh no, my dad's a doctor and he would always tell me just horror stories......about ghosts and goblins who totally supported the princess's right to smoke.
Okay. God y'know, if someone told me a week ago that I would be peeing in Joey Tribbiani's apartment...
Oh that couldn't have been pretty. but you know guys do that.
Yeah, I didn't want you to get hit by the boom!
I didn't know there were docks.
OK, you're whiney, you are, you're obsessive, you are insecure, you're, you're gutless, you know, you don't ever, you don't just sort of seize the day, you know. You like me for what, a year, you didn't do anything about it. And, uh, oh, you wear too much of that gel in your hair.
What's this.
There's not gonna be a wedding. Ross and I are not getting married.
Ohhh, this is the least jealous I've ever been!
What? Oh, I'm sorry, I can't, I'm busy.
Ok.
Thank you! Break!
Mon, I'm so sorry.
Maybe. But just a little one. Phoebe got the whole world.
And you are so in style right now. Y'know, I work at Ralph Lauren and the whole fall line has got this like equestrian theme going on. I don't suppose you saw the cover of British Vogue, but...
Ross, why do you hate our child?
I'm sorry, you know, maybe I wasn't being clear. Uh, this is our cart.
Bye.
Oh, great!
No, I'm not.
Wait a minute! Wait a minute! I'm not saying that you shouldn't have a bag, I just-it's just there are other bags that are a little less umm, controversial.
Okay! All right! How was she?
I don't know. He was cute, and he liked me. It was an impulse.
No!! No! He's not married, or involved, with anyone!
No, that's ok, let's me just get my check book!
Whoa, wait, listen, I think I'm just gonna talk to Ross about what he think it meant.
All right. I'm a total pro!
Aw, Mon...
Oh, I love to ski! How amazing is this?!
Do you know something?
Ohhhh, come on!!!
Third one from the left?
Oh, I know, I know, it's-it's so, it's so totally like, "Whoa! Can we do this?" Y'know, I mean, but I mean it just feels right! Don't you think? It does! I mean, it just feels right, don't you think?
What?
Well y'know what they say, the 23rd time's the charm. Aww, look at you all handsome!
I'm just kidding too. I'm getting married in December.
But ah, you're safe from it if it's in the freezer?
Honey, come on, I have to be at work in like ten minutes Oh, all right, well it's not like I'm employee of the year or anything.
Ross! Your honor, rest assured relationship ended like two years ago! And could you strike "Consummated like bunnies" from the record?
Hi, Pheebs? Okay, so just spoke to the nurse and the reason that your doctor is late is because uh, she's not coming.
Nodded off!! Ross you were snoring. My father's boat didn't make that much noise when it hit rocks!
The meeting with the guy went great?
Yeah, that's gonna get you into Soap Opera Digest. Well I......I would just like to say that Joey truly has enriched the days of our lives.
No!!
Yeah me too. oh! I have an idea. Why don't we all pitch in 50 bucks, we'll pool our money together and then if we win, we'll split it! Everyone almost simultaneously except Ross: yeah thats a great idea!
Well, what happened?
Heyyyyy! Contraceptives are not always effective! Right?
That's it. Ow!!!
Oh my God! What does that thing do?
Oh hell, he's done this three times! He knows what its about!
None.
I'm-I'm-I had no idea. I'm sorry. I...
...we went back the house and we got really silly and we...we made out.
ah ha ha. ah ha ha. It's forty five.
Joey, if you wanna look good, why don't you just come down to the store? I'll help you out.
Wait a minute! What do you mean, you're taking over my job?
Yeah fun? Great! So uh, so did you guys hit it off?
No please, show me how I begged you!
Uh, yeah. Uh, Monica, y'know, honey, I've been thinking about it and I've decided thisthis whole Ross thing, it's just not a good idea.
He got it a flea market!
Noo!! No! You thought, you actually thought I wanted to have sex with you?!
I know that too.
Oh yeah? Startin' to feel her again there are we?
What are you guys doing here?
What? What's the matter?
You know what we should all do? Go see a musical.
Oh Gunther! You brought candy! Thank you so much for picking this up! You are so sweet.
I always loved that!!
I guess.
Together.
Really?! Got a little crush on Tag there do ya?
Huh?
How often do you read it?
I was just getting him to like you.
Honey wait, Joey, I'm sorry I mean as terrific as I think you are with it...
I know, I know. And oh, and this time Chip promised that-that this time it will last at least for an entire song!
No! So I can be by myself. Y'know? Have a little alone time.
Honey, you have nothing to prove. And if you really like this girl, I don't flirting is the right thing to...
Yes!
Hi, welcome to our tropical Christmas party. You can put your coats and sweaters and pants and shirts in the bedroom.
Yeah, just give me a minute! Oh well, yes, I can think of one good thing.
Hi!
Hey! You guys umm, I want you to meet Sebastian.
Ohh, whoa God! Storage rooms give me the creeps! Monica, come on please hurry up honey! Please?
What about all the women you want to bring home?
Okay.
Okay.
I'm just gonna go in my office and pick up some stuff . Who the hell are you!?
Are you kidding?! With the, with the lilies, and-and the song, and the stars! It was...really wonderful! Did you just make that up?
Ohh! This is so exciting! Oh God... Come and knock on my door...
Yes I can!
Pheebs? Could you get that? Please?
Well, just because it happened that way for them doesn't mean it has to happen that way for us.
Oh you did, there are twenty in here.
Oh, God, he's such a pig,
Oh wow! That deserves another piece of candy.
No, I stuff outside the bra.
Sophie sit!!
Oh I see, so this suit is making a point.
I mean, you know... Ross and I haven't dated in like... six years...
Oh good.
Hi, I'm Rachel Green. What can I do for you Joshua?
Hi! Emma will be up in a minute!
When Carol was pregnant with Ben...
Don't worry I promise that you will only have to be pregnant for a few more hours, 'cause I'm going to tell the father today.
God, Ross, look, what you and I have is special, all Paolo and I ever had was...
All right, first name on the speed dial is mom.
Yes, his name is Barry, he's a doctor, thank you very much.
Yes! I will! Absolutely! Hello, Rachel. Hi, Joshua. I left my wallet here on purpose. Really? Yes, I just wanted to see you again. Oh, I'm glad. Rachel, I'd like to say something to you. Yes? How you doin'?
Uh-huh.
Then, you will definitely get him back!
Really?! Oh my God! I'm successful!
Oh you went to the movies by yourself?
Right, yeah, I've heard that about cute doctors.
Oh, you did this to him?
Hi!
Oh, that is so sick.
Oh, get out of here!
Career counselor?
Well in High School, that added up to head cheerleader.
What?
Uh-oh.
Oh well then, so I'm just going to go back to talking to my friend here. And you can go back to enjoying your little hamburger.
Already? That's pretty bad what you did.
Really?
Now, come on, come on, Steve. There must be something that you like about yourself.
Mm-hmm.
Hi! I just want to apologize. I'm really sorry I was a baby.
Ohh, I love Joey! Joey lives with a duck!
Wh-Phoebe!!
Y'know, I-I gotta tell ya, those eye drops are a miracle. My eye is a 100% better.
No. No, no, I'm not ready! How can I be ready? "Hey, Rach! You ready to jump out the airplane without your parachute?" Come on, I can't do this!
Ew! Gross.
So did I.
No, I can't, I have a baby.
Phoebe! You can't do th...
Do you even understand what off the rack means?!
Hey!
Hey, guys, what's up.
A birthday party.
Oh, I'm sorry, you're right.I'm sorry, good luck!
Oh but Joey, I have to go. There's no room for a baby here.
Ooo! Oh, I forgot they made sheets!
Oh, thank you that's very helpful, I'm glad you came over.
That's really nice.
And now you're watching me walk away.
Hey!
So did I. I'm really glad Monica asked us out.
What? They were like this!
Well, she-she ob-obviously saw the tire tracks that were leading up to the closed garage.
Pheebs?
Beefsteak Charlie's?
Ok, not that you need it but good...GOD!Is that Chase Lassiter?He's straight, right?
Ohh, I'm gonna have to get over it. God, see I didn't know that's I had to do, I just have to get over it.
Oh, look at her, so happy!
What?!
Oh but he did say that they found the grandmother wandering down fifth avenue.
Wh?!
Well, at least that's a great suit.
No, you know what, it's late, everything's gonna be closed. Why don't we just do it another night?
No, come on, I'm totally ok. I don't need you to come! I can totally handle this on my own.
Ewww. Yeah. Umm. I think I'm gonna stay here.
Excuse me! But this is a purebred, show-quality Sphinx cat!
Dealer takes two. What do you bet?
We're gonna find love!
Y'know Bob in Human Resources...
Oh, hi!
Come on! We will be there for you the whole time! Just remember gal pal Rachel Green. Ha-ha! I'm gonna be in Soap Opera Digest! And not just in the dumb crossword puzzle. Seriously, proud of you.
Phoebe!
Hi!
Oh, honey, don't worry. She's gonna make it on time.
Oh, ok, thank you. Do you see what all the guys see in her?
No-no! Big bear! Big bear outside! I think I-I-would you-actually, would you go check on that?
No, you! Phoebe you freaked me out. You kept saying how huge this all is!
All right, come on, let's go get your coat.
Honey, this really is an incredible thing to do for them, but there are things to think about.
What is the matter with us?
'Cause I know he's gonna flip out and I hate it when he's angry.
I don't know. Is it crazy?
Ya know, in crazy world, that means you're married.
Yes, we do.
Wow! Oh-okay, look pal, I am not in the mood to be hit on right now! But if you give me your number I will call you some other time.
Wow!
Monica, last Saturday night, what happened on Walker Texas Ranger?
Yeah Melissa, I don't want to be known as the uh, office bitch, but I will call your supervisor.
Ok professor or detective?
Ben, its Rachel! But whatever.
Ross, you don't know that.
Joey, we're not keeping this!
Hey, thanks Ross, for taking care of all of this.
Why not? I don't want to do this alone! And he's such a sweet guy and he loves me so much.
What? I was just trying to teach you.
Oh. That's so Monica can keep track. That way if one on them is missing, she can be like, 'Where's number 27?!'
I'm so sorry.
Ewwww!!
Ohh! That's great!
Monica. You've, you've done it right?
I dunno.. I-I thought it looked better there. And I- and also, it's an extra seat around the coffee table.
All gone! So, farm birds, huh?
I'm just sort of in the middle of something.
Thank you.
Yes, my wind. How do you expect me to grow if you won't let me blow?
Hello!
Is there room on that step for a pathetic loser?
Ross...
Okay-okay-okay-okay-okay-okay-okay! I got it! I got it! I got it! I can't! I can't! I can't! I cannot go with you and my sister thing. Okay? I just can't. It's just too weird, all right? I imagine the two of you together and I freak out. It freaks me out. I can't do it! I can't do it.
Its back in cage!
Hey! We were not on a-Okay. That's fine! Fine. Y'know what Ben? One day when you are a lot older I am going to tell you that entire story over a pitcher of real margaritas, okay?
Why?! Why not?!
Well it happened about six weeks ago, and uh I had just got home from work and Ross was already there 'cause I guess he had been hanging out with Joey.
What?
Hi!
Good luck Chandler.
Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here..
Oh yeah, we were but umm, now we've got candy.
Joey, come on!
Am I the only one who doesn't think that she's hot? Ross?
Okay. Walked right into that one didn't he?
I could not have done this without you.
Well, I guess we just find a divorce lawyer?
All right, listen, missy. If you want this cart, you're gonna have to take me with it!
Well how can that be, you were just kissing Sabrina?
Come on Ross! You said you wanted to talk about it, let's talk about it!! How was she?
Eh. Beth dies.
Ahhhh!
Well, basically, lately, I've uh, I've uh, sort of had feelings for you.
Really? You think so?
Okay, y'know what uh, actually, that's great. That helps a lot. Thanks.
Hi. Ohhh, you got my message.
Hi.
I also said number one.
Chandler, aren't you worried about what to get Monica for Christmas?
Yeah?
Hi.
Okay, well that's now the third sign that I should not leave Emma.
...I just don't know if the world is ready for you and your bag.
Oh God, oh God, oh God oh God oh God oh God....
I... I... I...
Well, so, are-are you sure that there are three?!
None.
There is a hardware store right down the street?
Well, Ross said my name.
Yes, Joey, I remember, she's annoying, but you know what she's-she's his girlfriend now. I mean what can we do?
Okay, fine! But you know what? If I was in 36D, we would not be having this problem.
Alright, fine, you go ahead and you do that, alright Ross.
Well, look, it's hardly snowing anymore. I mean you couldn't ask for a more romantic setting. This could be the simple wedding you've always wanted!
Surprised?
Hey Joey, what 'cha doing?
What? Why? Where are you?
Really?
Ohhhh, I cannot look at it!
Rossy, Rossy.
So from that you think you've got me all figured out? Well, you don't! Y'know I-I could have toys for underprivileged kids in here!
Oh, but look how straight those noodles are!
Hey!
I know, yeah, sorry.
Thank you.
Don't do that.
I get it!
Yes, please.
Phoebe. We would like to talk to you for a second.
But Joey the baby is going to be crying, it's going to be loud.
Oh God Monica hi! I just went to your building and you weren't there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are, you are!
I just- I don't think us getting back together is a good idea.
Why not?
You don't tell a guy that you're looking for a serious relationship! You don't tell the guy that! Now you scared him away!
Joey, get Amy's bags, she is moving out!
Oh, just tell us! We're not gonna want it!
Honey, we have to go. Our reservations are at 8:00.
Yeah, I can't *wait* to go back to work.
Ok, Pheebs, you know what, if we had that, we wouldn't be doing the ritual in the first place.
Joey, is this that thing that you do when you say you're bad so I'll give you a compliment?
Ya think?
I don't wanna stand in the way of true love or anything, but I think a cantaloupe might hurt less.
Taurus?
Thank you. Thank you. I love you.
Oh, you guys, I can't believe this. But I'll leave now, or I'm gonna miss my plane.
You know what?
Mon, honey you're not dying. I'm just moving out. Y'know, I mean we're gonna see each other all the time.
Why?
Hi you. I can't believe I'm waking up next to you.
Oh, no, no, I don't have one. I just need to talk to my friend.
Yeah! I don't think you're going to need it though. Okay, check this out. If it's a girl, Rain.
Rachel.
Oh! That's why. I'm sorry!
Phoebe!
Well, you know, honey, I don't think everybody gets Smelly Cat. You know, I mean, if all you've ever actually had are healthy pets, then, whoosh!
Um, there was a Geller Cup?
Steve... sleeve!
Well, I-I know you can do that too. I'm just, I'm just saying if you need somebody to talk to... Hi!
Oh, I don't know. I guess we have to eat.
You bought boobs?
Ohh, he's married! Ross is married. I can't-I still can't believe it.
What's up?!
Yeah, he broke those too.
Do you got your gracious loser face?
Ohh, that is soo sad.
OK, well, bye-bye again.
Oh, I was just gonna ask!
Uh, to Stephanie Schiffer.
Foot rubs for a month!
Guess who we ran into today?!
Ugh, she is a slut!
OK, OK. So, you ever get a pet with a girlfriend?
I don't know all the words.
Oh.
Really.
Well, I-I don't like it.
Hi Tag! Hey, so did you have fun with uh, with Joey last night?
Uh, I will see you... and I'll raise you. What do you say... want to waste another buck?
Well I assume the ah, happy couple isn't up yet. Did you guys hear them last night?
I mean I got news for you mister, Emma? Not easy.
Ross! Come on! That's all right! Fine--Okay, I have a weird thing about my eye. Can we not talk about it please?
Honey, someday you are gonna make some man the luckiest guy in the world.
Okay, get ready to see some beggin'!
Well, as long as we are clear about that.
Thank you.
Every day, you are becoming more and more like your mother.
Okay, you look in the kitchen, I will look in the back closet.
Monica what?
It's a pretty cool tux.
Hey Mona!
Hi, it's me. I've been trying to reach you all night. I feel awful. Please, Ross, you gotta know there is nothing between me and Mark. This whole break-up thing is just stupid.
I meant er, young, young, I meant young, young to be a doctor. Oh good, Rach.
So she's really not dead.
No, really. Really, Pheebs, you're not gonna be the one worrying about saving for college, or yelling at them when they're bad, y'know, or deciding to put them on Ritalin when they just won't calm down. Y'know?
So Mon, when are we gonna meet this new secret waiter man?
It's not a purse! It's a shoulder bag.
Well of course we will help you decide! We will do anything we can to help you! Now, I would like to make a toast, to the future Mrs. Chandler Bing , my best friend, and truly one of the nicest people that...
I'm really, really not.
I said it's still nap time.
Ah.
Okay, y'know what?! I know-I know how to settle this! All right here, this is what we're gonna do! I'm gonna write Joey on one napkin and I'm gonna right Ross on the other napkin and we are going to pick one! And that person is going to be our backup! Okay?
Okay.
Yeah, right. Look at you, you're practically giddy.
What did, what did he say?
Maybe it's not as bad as I think. Y'know, maybe they didn't take it the way I meant it.
Ross look, look this is good for you. Okay? Let's face it, so far the guy's not lovin' ya! But I can turn that around! I got the inside track! We can all go out to dinner, y'know? And I can talk you up! Ross, the guy is a very, very successful lawyer!
Of course!
You ah, you didn't say 'Yes' to that did you?
Oh, you're one of those. But y'know what? I have two sisters of my own and we just-just tortured each other.
Yeah. Sure.
Yeah, he did! Oh, see, this is what I'm talking about!
Great, people having sex, that's just what I need to see.
So, uh, how was your day?
Oh my God! That's my boss. You have to seat us somewhere else.
Ross, you know what...
And sorta just put the receipt back in your pocket?
Gunther, I quit.
Oh my goodness, she had the smoothest skin! I mean when I stuck that dollar bill in her g-string and grazed her thigh...
All right!
Oh!
Where am I gonna get a cowgirl outfit on Thanksgiving?
I'm sorry, as I was saying the store number is wrong, and I'm sorry but that's... Oh my God!!
I don't know... sometimes it doesn't.
Wow! Would I have seen you in anything?
Yeah, yeah, I know.
Joey! Joey!
Oh, it's a tattoo! That's weird, Phoebe doesn't... Wait that's Ursula! That's not Phoebe that is Ursula!
Oh my God.
Okidoki! Wow! We're never gonna find a nanny.
I know them from work.
Okay.
Well first, for forgetting to throw you a bridal shower.
Awwww.
Yes, so close. Mrs. Lynch, I know that this is an emotional and difficult time, for all of us. But by any chance did Joanna send any paperwork your way before... it happened.
Uff.
Oh so-so not really never.
Oh no, wait a minute, wait, I've got a presentation tomorrow. I can't miss that.
Yeah? Well, you should know. You've bought like a billion of 'em.
Wow! It looks like the Easter Bunny's funeral in here.
Yeah, you should, really.
Hello.
Yeah!
Yeah, totally! You are in such good hands. And I'm so good with meeting parents. With the father, you know, you want to flirt a little bit, but not in a gross way. Just kind of like: "Oh mr. Pincer, I can see where Wallis gets his good looks..."
Oh, you're gonna love this cake. I got it from a bakery in New Jersey, Corino's.
Wow! Mon, thanks! I love this plate!
Okay. Oh wait! One more thing umm, do-do we still need to uh settle the question of "us?"
Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight with you Ross! Look, urrgh, maybe we should take a break.
Hey! So, did you quit?
Ew! No!
Ross?
Chandler M. Bing?
Yeah.
I think he's across the hall.
I don't care that you left. I'm just glad that you're here. Thanks you guys!
What party?
No, it's not gonna be okay Ross, tomorrow is my last day, and I don't have a lead. Okay, y'know what, I'm just gonna, I'm just gonna call Gunther and I'm gonna tell him, I'm not quitting.
Love you too... Alright, I'm going to bed.
Its still there!
Menstrual cramps.
It'll never last, he's just a rebound roommate.
And Monica, what are you going to make?
I thought it was Ross.
Do you really not know where I'm going with this? It left! It's one huge room!
Hello.
Oh, I blew it. I wouldn't of even hired me.
Oh, you're not gonna tell the whole story about how your parents got divorced again are you?
Yeah, Rachel. And this is Ross' sister, Monica. We met at Thanksgiving. .
Oh, great, Are you gonna be ok?
Yeah.
Okay, first of all, that's stupid and second of all, I'm not allowed to talk to Ralph.
Phoebe?! Wait a-but-but she just, she said that Joey was her backup.
Rosss...
Hey!
Are you kidding?!
What?
I would love to!
Plus, you know, he is with Charlie now.
What?!
Okay now Joey, y'know that since you're returning all of this stuff right after the audition you're gonna have to wear underwear?
Okay.
Seriously, good night!
Oh honey...
That was kind of rude!
Okay!
Oh for the love of God!
Interesting.
As are you...
Hey, who's this little naked guy?
Oh my God.
What?!
I can't believe Mark didn't call. It's Sunday night, and he didn't call.
Yeah, so?
Oh, ah with who?
Hi.
Right!
Yeah, I forget which ones.
Kate Miller?
Okay, calm down, here they are.
Mrs. Kay! Oh yeah, she was sweet. She taught me Spanish. I actually think I remember some of it, tu madre es loca.
Hi Joey, how ya doin'?
Were both of those Joey?
Phoebe!!
Hey!
No. Joey, she knows! We were at Ugly Naked Guy's apartment and we saw them doing it through the window. Actually, we saw them doing it up against the window.
I'm sorry, I can't!
No! They didn't even talk to each other. God, how was I supposed to know they were having problems?
You would do that? I never get picked!
Oh, howd she take it?
I swear, I never wanted any part of your night!
Yeah, this is Tag. Tag, this is Phoebe. Phoebe, can I see you for a second?
Okay.
Thank you. Well, I guess we have some time to kill.
Chandler, this is not addressed to you. This is addressed to Mrs. Braverman downstairs. Thief.
Aw, I love that.
Okay that is the one we already have!
All right.
Hi Danny! Wow! Thirsty huh?
Really?
All right.
Oh My God, Phoebe, that's not Ralph Lauren. That's Kenny the copy guy.
She's steaming her dress, why? What's up?
He's not having an affair!
Ooh, I was kinda hoping that wouldn't be an issue...
Okay! All right! How was she?
Monica! Look! Hi! What do ya think?
Yeah, and could you please chop some up and just put it right there in the sauce?
His new girlfriend!
Pheebs?
Wha.. well, Ella's a nice name!
Well, Phoebe that's fine because I'm not moving.
Well, I'm sorry I went out with him when I knew you liked him.
Well I'll tell ya! See uh my-my boss and his wife-They-they can't have children. So umm, and that-we were at the Christmas party, and he got drunk, and he said to me, "Rachel, I want to buy your baby."
Why? Is he? He is! Isn't he? He's dating that slut in marketing!
Please? YES! Sandy you're hired.
Well, legend has it Joey, that... she comes alive when you're asleep.
Well, I kind of... I kind of lost him.
Ugh, it was horrible! And-and the interview part went so well, y'know? I even made him laugh. He said something about a boat and I was like, "Well, yeah! If you've got enough life jackets!" Trust me, it was actually, it was very funny. Anyway, so we were saying good-bye and ugh!
Oh my God Ross! What in heaven's name are you doing here?
Thank God.
He's like a big disgusting...
Hey!
Yeah, what did happen?
Oh really, OK.
Babies don't care if they're slim.
Yeah! All right, I'll see you guys later.
You said she was bald.
Forgot my purse! Oh, you guys made up. He's a good kisser isn't he? I'm going!
Hi, sweetie!
Aside from the fact that you said you had them?
No. No, you can't.
I wanna say a disease.
Awww...
I want the little round waffles.
All right!
I'm sorry. What?
I haven't seen it yet!
Ohh, you should know, this place is a real babe magnet. Wanna make out?
I've never lived like this before.
It's good. Except he makes us watch the Discovery Channel all day long. Did you know that something really boring happened to someone really ugly in the Middle Ages? Oh, thank you. I'll see you guys later.
Well what?! How-how much is it?!
Oh.
Huh?
Y'know what? I don't, I don't think Phoebe really wants to come.
Oh. Oh wait no.
Who?
Yep.
Oh, well, you know, they're just separated so, you know, never know, we'll see.
What?!
You know that depends on what it is! I've done a lot of stuff.
Umm, I'm sorry. Do you-do you have a problem with me?
Yeah uh, y'know what uh, let's skip it.
Of course he will! But Chandler the most important thing is you forgive yourself!
Thanks. God this is so stupid! How could I be upset over something I never had? It's negative?
Time is money my friend?
No. I have got to get ready and go to a dinner at my bosses house. It's a very big deal, there's a lot of people there I have to meet.
Honey, Monica, this is ridiculous! Look...
Listen. Sudden change of plans. My maternity leave just ended. They told me that if I didn't come back today, they were gonna fire me.
Oh, that sounds good!
What?!
Yeah!
...were you this irritating?
What?! She made the tea!
God, oh God Monica, I forgot. This is our first date.
Okay. Okay. I think we can do this if we just get organized. All right? We have two days to plan this party. We just need to make fast decisions! Okay? All right, where are we gonna have it?
Hello? Oh, Pheebs! It's Phoebe!
Well would you like me to lie down on the table?
Monica, is this true?
Okay. Honey, I would love for you to go with me. What?
Oww!
Oh come on!!
It's really not that big!
Why, how much is this gonna cost?
I guess you weren't there.
Um, excuse me Gavin, I have a question I need to ask you.
Well, yeah! I'm still pursuing that.
Bye house!
Ooohhhh!!
So....
Hi! You might not remember us, but we are the girls that fogged you.
So Joey I just hooked Ross and Chandler up with some tuxedos for the wedding, do you need one?
I can't believe it! He still hasn't called.
I... Am I the only one that this is embarrassing for?
This was such a huge mistake. I can't tell him Phoebe. I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't...
Yeah. Why? Is that weird for you?
Uhh.... waitressing?
Hey, listen, Joey, about Molly, I really prefer if you didn't go after her.
Yes.
For what?
I can't go to my own prom without a date, I can't, it's too late.
Ross, you don't seem okay.
Barry?
Y'know, you-you also could've used uh, lamps and then followed the light.
Left.
I know. I know, but y'know condoms only work like 97% of the time.
Excuse me. It's about the job.
Okay, that sounds fair. It just means that once again we can't...
I know, I know, but uh just, I'm telling you, once, once you get past that part, that where it-it just feels like you wanna die, he's-he's really a good person.
Ross! What are you... I'm sorry sir. I just, I think he just really likes you.
Well, well, well, look what mommy found!!
What?!
Now, does it really matter?
How is it going with Charlie?
I am not gonna answer that!
Oh.
No! Nothing!
Oh, come on Ross...
Ooh great! Very Monica.
I just can't believe this is happening. I mean, when I was little, everybody's parents were getting divorced. I just figured as a grownup I wouldn't have to worry about this.
Monica, I'm your best friend.
Oh Ross, honey you gotta stop torturing yourself!
Hi!
Oh no, yes I do! I do! I mean, come on go on, you were, you were saying I am happier when uh, y'know?
Oh yeah. All right, back to work.
Yeah, oh my God, tomorrow! That, no, it's perfect. Oh God, thank you soo much. Great! Bye! I got the interview!
Oh, do I?
Oh yeah, now everybody wants to be under this hat!
Ooh, okay... good.
Fine, I will.
Well, maybe that's, maybe that's really brave.
Why? I love that thing.
All right, who would uh, like some yams? Will?
Do you guys want these?
No! There's no orange juice in there! We win!!
Why the hell didn't you tell me!
No, wait. Wait.
Ok, I've got one. Wow, those things almost never come true.
Yeah.
Pheebs, I don't know what to say. I guess the flea market was just better last time.
Okay. Great! So now that you guys all know you can help me. Give me some advice on how I'm gonna tell Ross!
Look Joey, come on she's so perfect for you! I mean she's sweet, she-she likes baseball, and she-she had two beers at lunch.
Yes!
Really, I shouldn't feel guilty?
Well look who's here!
Oh, yeah sure, Ok.
God, isn't this exciting? I earned this. I wiped tables for it, I steamed milk for it, and it was totally not worth it. Who's FICA? Why's he getting all my money? I mean, what- Chandler, look at that.
Op.
Oh, he's just goofing around.
Oh. Oh! I can do it!
No.
Hey, I was doin' great before I found out about you. You think it's easy for me to see you with Julie?
Hey! What's goin' on?
Joey, had reasons.
All right. Fine.
No, he said we were holding up the people behind us.
Okay, okay, I checked. We have: Earl Grey, English Breakfast, Cinnamon Stick, Camomile, Mint Medley, Blackberry, and.. oh, wait, there's one more, um.. Lemon Soother. You're not the guy that asked for the tea, are you? Okay.
Oh! Oh my God! What did I just do?
I know.
Then we took a walk down to Bendall's, and I told him not to, but he got me a little bottle of Chanel...
Wow that's uh, juicy. Umm, y'know what though Mon, I actually do have a lot of work to do so if-if-are you sure there's just not anything else?
Ooh, it was only okay.
Yeah, no, I don't-I don't put things in my eye.
What do you get? Emily!! Emil-Whoa!! Okay! So that's me as a cheerleader! Ta-dum!
Come on Ross give me the keys! Monica does not know what she's talking about! I am an excellent driver!
Absolutely! Absolutely!
Ohh, okay, how about five. Ohh, thank you.
Hey!
Hi Joey! What are you doing here?
Oh yeah. Okay, see mom, the truth is I can do this on my own.
But you are a liar.
Isn't it incredible?! Monica and Chandler, gettin' married.
That is not a problem.
Wha...
Phoebe, come on that's silly.
Well, we are ready to try anything.
Oh my God! I can't believe you guys are actually think you're moving in here!
: Loser?
No...Yeah, all the time, constantly. It's terrifying. But you know that I figure it...it has to work out.
You're right. You're right. I mean I'm about to have a baby, I can tell my mother that I don't want her to just be sleeping on my couch! Oh my God! She's gonna want to sleep in my bed with me. This cannot happen!
Okay then!
Huh, well maybe it uh, it changed.
It's gonna be up all night!
I thought it was Chandler!
You know what?
There's nobody here!
Oh God.
What?
Yeah well, you know what, so is uh, Sorentino's.
Really?
Who ? Joey: Me.
Noooooooo!!
Oh God! This is silly, I'm gonna see you in a couple of hours!
Well of course that is what I'm here for!
Oh, you're not having fun, are you?
Okay Phoebe, we can not tell anyone about this.
I mean do you have any fun, you know, fantasy type things?
Hey!
Oh, how does he look? How does he look?
Sure.
Ross, why didn't you tell me that?
What?
I'm serious, I really, I think I need just to have some...meaningless, sex y'know, with the next guy that I see.
Ewwww!!
Umm, hi!
Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks!
Because, he's my friend.
Or?
Okay, but before you go, could you help me first?
Ohh, I just don't think I have enough left on my credit card.
Honey, stop it! I am not going to tell you until I tell him.
No Joe, no miracle.
Me, Fledermaus, great. I really-
Umm, can I use your bathroom?
Basketball!
Honey, why is it hard, I mean we've been together for almost a year now?
How did it go?
Closer than here?
You're out of toilet paper!
How was the honeymoon? Phoebe; Oh, incredible! Oh! Champagne, candle-lit dinners, moonlight walks on the beach, it was sooo ro-man-tic!
You're gonna be late! Go! Go!
Hi, I'm sorry, I need to borrow your phone for just one minute.
What?
Ohh! Me too!
Ok.
Why? Why not?! People love to hear that!
My God!
Remember when we went to Central Park and rented boats?.. That was fun.
Well, get back in there and talk!
Oh no-no-no! No, I got this all under control.
Oh it's OK. You were worth the wait, and I don't just mean tonight.
Oh Ross!!
Well, first of all, Paulo and I are not back together. It was just a stupid thing I did, and if I could go back in time and do it again, well, I wouldn't. Um, second of all , what?
Oh, that's very-Really very-very okay.
You take that back.
Oh! That's great!
Is Monica here?
Oh God. You did. You heard. Ok, listen, let me explain.
Fine.
I know.
Yes! And not because I want you to go out with me, but because I don't want you to go out with anybody! Okay? I know it's a terrible thing to even think this, and it's completely inappropriate, but I want you to be at my constant beck and call 24 hours a day! I'm very sorry, but that is just the way that I feel.
So wh..? He's smart, he's qualified. Give me one good reason we shouldn't try him out.
Ah that's great. No actually that's... That's great! That's really great! Y'know, I gotta tell ya writing, I mean writing, gets me uh, gets me kinda hot.
Okay. Oh wait, wait-wait, you're not gonna come with me?
Funny, because I was just gonna go across the hall and write that on Chandler.
Space cowboy!
Ohh! That's so great!
What if she jumped out the bassinet?
What's up Joe?
Oh! My hero! What happened?
Hello.
Wow, Monica, I love that, you really have faith in me. Thank you. Technical question, how do you know when uh, the butter's done?
Y'guys ever heard the story about when Rosses mom went to the beauty salon?
Is the window open? Because if there's a window open, a bird could fly in there.
Okay, y'know what? I'll-I'll have toast!
Okay, well if I stop playing with Joey and Chandler, can I play with Mark?
OK, that's dead right?
Because it's Richard's son! It's like inviting Greek tragedy over for dinner!
What are you, what are you doin'?
You idiot!!
Ugh, Monica I don't want to steal your stupid thunder!
Ok. Wha...? where? Where are you going?
Nooo!
I can't believe they've been together for three years.
And thank you for your time.
No, I know! I get it! It's funny!
Hey.
I don't know, y'know? I feel a little umm... No, y'know what? Nevermind, I'm gonna be fine.
Really? Excited?
Ugh!
Seriously stop it, or I'm gonna jump on ya.
Oh, no no no no no.
Does anybody need more coffee?
I'll say.
Why are- why are you so tanned?
Oh... that's too bad. Bye bye.
But why, why not?
Hey, now wait a minute! I get when you told people at first that you wanted to be an actor they laughed at you! Now come on Bobby, why don't you tell us a little bit about your band?
Is he okay in there?
Yeah, all right. All right! Just keep walkin'! All right?
A big idiot.
What's the big deal? Why don't you wanna see Janice?
But you could teach us.
Monica, what should I do?
Well, then I get to give him the cell phone.
It was an amazing night.
He is so cute!
Actually, y'know that's not the Thanksgiving I was talking about.
Noo.
Yeah. Yeah. Oh, but once you find it, ohh it's so worth the wait.
Um-hmm.
Oh.
Well better than you, but y'know still not what you want.
Sorry I'm late, but I left late.
Hmm-hmm.
Oh, screw you guys, you don't have to do it!
Oh, no, meh-nah-nah-nah, come on you're gonna ruin it!
Absolutely.
Hey, Mr Philips, nice suit!
Okay, you want me to stop at the ATM?
Okay. Ooh, my! Woah! Why is that baby torturing that woman?!
Well, I have been spending a lot of time in the lab.
Ahhhh!!
Ah, what is this? Well, lets see, we kissed for ten minutes and now we're talking to our friends about it, so I guess this is sixth grade!
I'm not?
Oh yes, absolutely! Y'know, it's weird uh, but I had a dream last night where I was stopped by a policeman. And then he uh...well I probably shouldn't tell you the rest.
Why aren't you guys at the movie?
I can't say that I'm surprised.
Joey, honey, I don't think you're supposed to go back there.
No! Sorry, I just thought you were somebody else. Hi!
Oh, yeah! Real fun. Y'know, this bra... Really, bothers me. Y'know, this used to be my bedroom. Yeah. A lot of memories in here, a lot of memories. If these walls could talk, y'know what they'd say? Wanna hear some memories?
Chandler, what are you doing?
Hi!
Joey, Joey I love you so much, but I...
Ohh, hi, Kim.
But Erin Brockovich had her own house.
You. Like you haven't done enough.
Oh my God!
Ohh! Right! Right, sorry, I'll be right back!
Joey? Are you in there?
Yeah. Well. Hey uh Joe, would mind going over to Chandler's bedroom and get that book back that he borrowed from me?
Run Phoebe run.
Then what's that big lump under your covers?
No.
Yeah Pheebs, honey, she just got engaged a couple of hours ago. I doubt she's even had time to...
Joey, what... is... this...thing... doing here?
Well, maybe sometimes I find out things or I hear something and I pass that information on y'know kinda like a public service, it doesn't mean I'm a gossip. I mean, would you call Ted Kopel a gossip?
I mean he just started going out with her.
What time is it?
Oh... Well...
Let's dry 'em again.
Well, can't you just go to Vermont the next day?
That sounds like a plan. Umm, is there a place I can go freshen up?
"Oh, my, god."
Ooh, I just feel bad, I never vacuum.
Go on! Go on.
Look at that! Look at that! We all do it. Okay, I'm stopping now.
Okay.
Uh-huh.
Oh my God.
Well, I don't know, you guys figure it out, I got to put Emma down for a nap.
Hey!
Oh yeah! Oh my God! That is our friend! It's Naked Ross!
Dr. Wiener.
That is the most ridiculous...
Who is it?
Oh, well...
Yeah! Guess who walks into my office is the end of my story. It was Ralph Lauren! Ralph Lauren walked into my office!
So why don't you just let me worry about making the trifle and you just worry about eating it, alright?
Oh yeah, what's it about?
Yeah but, I've never asked a guy out before.
Yeah.
well, now, wait a second, who did I just put as my "In case of emergency" person?
Look, Chandler, he has moved on, OK, you have to too.
Oh, I think I saw some in here.
Ok, ok, that's fine. Fine. Hey, I'm sorry about that spill before. Only $98.50 to go.
Wow, y'know if Joey and Chandler walked in right now, we could make a fortune!
I didn't. I got under him.
It's gonna poop!
Oh God, she mu... she must need her diaper changed.
Yes, I do.
Monica, nothing has even happened yet, and you're already so...
But I haven't used my card in weeks!
Uh, let's rip!
Yeah?
Yep. Oh, yeah, look you great. Oh yeah. Yeah, this looks great. Umm, so you like it?
Did they mention that I'm rubber and you're glue?
Ok, I, I will do your laundry for one month.
Ohh, so do you! Did you lose weight?
Hello.
Hi!
Yes, yes, it does. Okay, look, the restaurant called, they wanna know if you're gonna be showing up for work?
Oh-oh!! One hand on the sheet Joe!
Alright. Thats it!
Thank you.
Doesn't he?
I think you should definitely go out with this guy.
Phoebe, I thought your dad was in prison.
I can't! It's too late! Terry already hired that girl over there. Look at her, she's even got waitress experience. Last night she was teaching everybody how to make napkin.... swans.
Oh!
"Well, but I'm not sure I really want to do anything about it."
Okay, see now, what I just heard, blah-blah-blah, blah-blah-blah-blah-blah, blah-blah-blah, blah, blah.
No, I'm saying...
Huh, that's funny. You look like you're gonna be the...
No you don't.
Well, maybe you didn't want it to end?
Yeah. Yeah, and y'know you-you deserve to win. And-and y'know I was thinking about it, if-if you're Monica's maid of honor that means I get to be yours.
Ok, who ordered what?
I mean we're not, we're not gonna live together anymore?
No, forget it! No way! I am not sending anymore Ralph Lauren clothes to prison. It is a waste.
She could be out of town. Maybe she'll be gone for months.
You know.
What-what?! You're gonna leave this person with me?!
Hey!
We?!
Well...
Uh-huh... why... do you not like them?
Ooooh! Wow!! Oh, hi.
She's still with you?
Okay! Okay! Umm, Webster's Dictionary defines marriage as... Okay!! Forget that! That sucks!! Okay, never mind! Forget it! Umm, umm, okay, uh... I met, I-I met, I met Monica when we were just a couple of six year olds and I became friends with Chandler when he was 25, although he seemed like a six year old.
Hey!
So how's it goin' with Joey?
Joey, do you have a minute?
What? What is it?
What?
I wasn't supposed to put beef in the trifle!
Look, I know you guys heard about the whole thing with me and Ross but y'know, I've been obsessing about it all day and I'd just love not to talk about it. All right?
...hormones, yeah.
I just can't believe this! I mean, with the holidays coming up- I wanted him to meet my family-
That's right, I wanna do it with you! I've been trying to fight it, but you just said all the right things.
Oh, look, wish me luck!
Hey, listen, Ronni, how long would you say Chandler's been in the shower?
No you guys...
Ahh, I don't believe you. I think you don't want them to see you begging me.
It sure is.
Ah!
Yeah, and if doesn't work, then we'll be just one of those couples that never have sex.
Hi.
Oh my God!
What!?
Well, who wouldn't?!
Oh, I can give you that.
Alright! Enough out of you!
Yeah? Wow! Y'know, that this thing has speakers in the headrest!
How are you doing this?
Well, okay, look. I don't know, listen, I don't know what's going on here but let's...
Well Joey, I hate to admit it, your way of sailing is a lot more fun.
I don't know, what were the names I just said?
Wh-wh-what? What?
But y'know what, if you think it's gonna be okay we'll just work out a system. Y'know, it'll be like college, I'll hang a hanger on the door and put a sign, "Come back later, I'm gettin' lucky."
No so we're protecting her.
Anastassakis/Papasifakis wedding, excellent! {It's a good thing Jennifer Aniston is Greek, because she had to pronounce those names. Luckily for me, they were written on a sign.} Congratulations. Mazel Tov! Hi! Oh, great hat. Listen umm, I need you to perform another wedding. Can you do that?
Whoa-whoa-whoa, let's say more!
No-no-no! This chair's not going anywhere.
Hmmm... this is so nice.
It's not dumb. But, maybe it's okay that you're not a part of it. Y'know what I mean? I mean it's like, I-I-I like that you're not involved in that part of my life.
Phoebe, his music could not get any worse. There are rats in the basement that are hanging themselves.
Okay. All right, stand up. Well, when we're at the door, I lightly press my lips against his, and then move into his body just for a second, and then I make this sound, "Hmmm." Okay, I know it doesn't sound like anything, but I swear it works.
Well I. . .
What are these?
Okay, here we go...
But, but, Mona, I live here.
All right, well how much time do you need?
What do you mean? You've been in my room before!
All right fine! You're not invited to the party we're gonna have either.
You know what?
Oh God, I can't believe you're making such a big deal about this. It was one kiss, one guy, one time!
4 o'clock. Food?
OK.
Oh.
I know. But if some guy who looks like Corey Haim wants to kiss me tonight, I'm sooo gonna let them!
We're having a girl.
Well, actually, I meant for me. The hiring committee is meeting people all day and...
Well, it's embarrassing. People were looking at us like we were crazy.
Thank God you're here! You have to help me! Were you just talking to yourself?
Oh yeah? Did he pull the old...
Stop picturing it!!
I want me to stay too.
Chandler!!
Well y'know I was just in the neighborhood and I passed by your building and I thought to myself, "What's up with Carol and sweet, little Ben?"
I'm the hell person whose office this is!
Hey Pheebs, I'm-I'm taking Charlie shopping, why don't you come and I'll help you find something.
Hey, Mon, if you were hoping to sleep with Joshua the first time tonight, which one of these would you want to be wearing.
Mindy.
Huh.
Wh-what's that?
All right, all right, you're right, I won't do anything with Joey, I just thought that we Ok so that would be two cups of tarragon, one pound of baking soda and one red onion?
I know I told you, it's a really big problem.
Hang in there. You hang in there.
Oh God.
Oh my God Phoebe, this is impossible! We can't do this by Friday! We have to find a place. We have to invite people! We have to get food! There's just too much to do! It's impossible! We can't do it! We cannot do it! We cannot do it!
Oh God Monica hi! Thank God! I just went to your building and you weren't there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are, you are!
You guys aren't doing anything tonight, are you?
Yeah. Nice try!
Oh come on Ross, we've done it before we'll do it again, it'll be a nice way to bookend the pregnancy.
Okay.
Why would you do that?
We are looking for our Christmas presents from Monica.
Mon, honey, I gotta ask you something.
Yeah right.
What? What secrets? You know secrets? What are they?
Aww, look at the little thing.
Well, he didn't say, but it was a fire. I'm guessing not very good. Come on, we gotta go!
Yeah that's right you weren't thinking! Y'know what? Let me give you something to think about!
Can any of you watch Emma?
Yeah okay, you laugh now, but she's gonna be yours.
Oh my God....What's he gonna do now? I can't watch! Oh. Seriously, how can you watch this? Aren't you scared?
Oh!!
Okay.
You brought a carrot?!
It's fine.
I've just been thinking about how my baby and I are gonna be all alone.
Ssshyeah, well, duh! I mean...
Okay... aahhh... Please laugh for mommy... Please? Please laugh for mommy... Not funny huh? Oh so, is it... only offensive novelty rap? Or maybe just, you know, rap in general? 'Cause mommy can rap... My name is mommy and I'm here to say / that all the babies are... Oh, I can't rap... Allright sweetheart... This is only because I love you so much, and I know that you're not gonna tell anybody... I like... big butts and I cannot lie... / You other brothers can't deny... / when a girl walks in with an itty bitty waist and a round thing in your face... Yes! Yes! Yes! YES! Oohhhhh! Oh! I like big butts and I cannot lie... / You other brothers can't deny... Oh Emma you're laughing! Oh you are, you really do like big butts, don't you. Oh you beautiful little weirdo...
Okay. Hey. Umm. Does everybody hate these shoes?
Oh, come on now, don't keep me waiting. Get those clothes off! But, I would keep that helmet on because you're in for a rough ride!
I'm sorry, I was just thinking you're day could still pick up.
Uhh, let's just stay clear of 'I'm the guy that's doing you daughter' and you should be ok.
Oh good. Ahhh! My God, sorry!
Really?! You think so? Y'know, I had just rolled out of bed.
And did you?!
Well y'know, I don't want you to be cold.
Not gonna find any clothes in there!
Oh great!
Phoebe, you had a date three days ago.
Wow. Ok.
Yes. Monica, you don't get it. It's bad enough that she's stolen the guy who might actually be the person that I am supposed to be with, but now, she's actually , but now she's actually stealing you.
But, what you and I have is so much better. Ok, we have tenderness, we have intimacy, we connect. Ya know, I swear, this is the best I have ever had.
Look at that guy by the window, wow!
I know, it's huge, and it's scary, and it's... really far, far away from you guys, but this is such an incredible opportunity for me. And I've already talked to them about our situation with Emma, and they said they'll do whatever we need to make us feel comfortable.
Yes, I did. Thank you very much, it was excellent.
Definitely! Phoebe, you will not find a single game show host, who's ass I cannot kick.
Now wait a minute. You just took all the words!
Wow! Look at that, Chip Matthews called. I wonder what he wants?
Hi! Wow! You look, you look...big.
Well, yeah! We're cool. Totally cool.
Ross, those things go like 40 miles an hour! Ok? When you're... and there is that moment when you are at the top, when you just don't know if you're gonna return back to earth!
Joey I don't think you know what behalf means.
Right. Was it the, "Please don't show me another picture of a trilobite vibe?"
Phoebe, honey, wanna get some breakfast?
I hope it's still funny when you're in hell.
No honey, it's okay! Listen, I'll got to Ross's and get the blender, you get all the margarita stuff ready.
Oh! Right! Yeah! Hold on, I'll be just clean up in here a little bit! Hello Gavin.
Chandler, aren't you worried about what to get Monica for Christmas?
OOooooo!
Come on apartment! Come on apartment! Oh! I know queen is high!
I love him. He's so pretty I wanna cry! I don't know what to do. Tell me what to do.
Yesterday!
Chandler, relax, Chandler, she'll be here.
Yeah.
Let's do it! Ross?
Hi!
See? I've even called Animal Control!
Well...
Okay.
Well, I haven't discussed it with him yet, but I know he's gonna be relieved. Last week, he brought this girl over and I started talking to her about morning sickness and then I showed her pictures from my pregnancy book.
Uh-huh.
Well...did you know he was gonna ask me?
Who are these men?
Rachel Green's office!! Give me that phone! Hello, this is Rachel Green, how can I help you? Uh huh ... ok then ... I'll pass you back to your son.
You guys, does this look like something the girlfriend of a paleontologist would wear?
Really? Well, it seems to me if you'd done the right thing, I would not have woken up today feeling stupid and embarrassed, I would have woken up feeling comforted and satisfied!
I know. It seems smaller somehow.
You don't know anything.
All right that's it! I am maid of honor!
See look Amy, we're a lot closer to Monica and Chandler. We see them every day. And truthfully honey, you don't seem very connected to the baby.
Hi!
Okay, I'm just gonna go over the basic points just one more time, are you ready?
Hey Joey!
Oh, oh, I love that Japanese place.
through the glass doors.
Phoe-be!!
Oh, come on! This is crazy! Can't we just flip a coin?!
Oh my God.
'Gone for more jars. Back later. Monica Geller.'
Oh and I'll call ya too!
What?
Oh, ooh, everything looks delicious. What should I ha-ave? What should I have?
Oh yeah. That makes sense.
No, nothin'.
Ross got married again-Nooooooo!!!!!!!!!
Yeah.
Oh! Oh by the way?
I know! It's like I'm being punished for not having this disgusting, poisoning habit!
Okay, umm, I'm gonna get my sweater.
Hi!
Phoebe, come on can we finish this later? Cause I wanna go running before it gets dark. Oh! Why don't you come with me?!
Yeah, we are definitely on Route 27.
whhh wait, you're gonna leave my party to take care of a box of rats?
Come on.
Yeah!!! Kill 'um!!!
Ahh!
Op, look! Claire forgot her glasses! And she's gonna be really needing these to keep an eye on that boyfriend, who, I hear, needs to keep his stapler in his desk drawer, if you know what I'm talking about.
Oh yeah, sure, that too.
No. A break from us.
And now, y'know, I'm like... I'm like the other woman! I feel so..
No, it's not that. I got fired today. And I didn't get the other job.
OK, alright, OK, um... then could you please, uh... just give him a message for me? Please? This is very important.
"Baddest man in the whole damn town."
Hi, I'm back. Listen, I need to...
Hey! Hi!
Hey, come on! I had this friend from college and I made the stupid mistake of telling Joey that one time...she and I y'know...kissed a little bit.
Are you serious?
Noo way, Kevin.
