Hey.
Okay, here's a good one for ya. Who do think would win in a fight between Ross and Chandler.
All right.
Who knows?
Give me $400!
No that's not it. They let me keep my key the last time they were out of town.
Yeah, I thought you knew that.
But you're still moving in together, right? Because my ad came out today.
What, oh, oh, oh, no, no, I can't, I can't tell you that, it's like the most awful, horrible thing I've ever done my whole life.
So, does that mean the audition is off?
Well, I-I might've said supergay.
How're you doing?
Oh, but when Phoebe has a problem, everyone's all ears!
Sure, no problem. Ooh-Hey, donuts!
Y'know what? Make fun all you want. This is a great bag! Okay? And it's as handy as it is becoming. Now, just because you don't understand something, doesn't make it wrong. All right? So from now on you guys are gonna have to get used to the fact that Joey, comes with a bag!
816, thank you!
Well, remember when they got in that big fight and broke up and we were all stuck in her with no food or anything? Well, when Ross said Rachel at the wedding, I figured it was gonna happen again, so I hid this in here.
Everybody smile! Okay, thanks a lot! Enjoy your stay at Caesar's! We hope it's toga-rrific! Kill me. Kill me now.
I couldn't help it, there love is so pure.
What do you mean? Rach, don't I seem like a professor you'd buy some kind of e-crap from?
She was all crying. She-she said you guys want different things, and that and that she needed time to think.
Look at me! I'm Chandler! Could I be wearing any more clothes? Maybe if I wasn't going commando...
Fan out! Fan out!
Oh, you told her you broke all the plates, huh?
Hey Rach listen, did you know that during pregnancy your fingers swell up to twice their size and never go back.
Back when you and Rachel were together, if Chandler had kissed her, would you hear him out?
Not a problem.
Really? Thanks.
No! No... and, for the record, I've also never given her a frosting from a can!
I don't know, she's, uh.... she's pretty great.
What? Rachel, listen, have you ever heard of Fortunata Fashions?
Uh! That's a tough one. Oh! Wait a minute, this happened to me before! Yeah, I was auditioning for a play and the producer fell asleep and... no wait a minute... it was me who fell asleep... Yeah I mean hey, Shakespeare, how about a chase scene once in a while!?
Damn!
Well, there is one way. His window's open, I say, we poke him.
Good call. Yeah. But, the face Ross, the face isn't Rachel.
Eddie.
No, I do six things! First, I look deep in her eyes. Then, I kiss her. Next I take my hand and I softly graze her thigh.
Anyway, I started working on what I'm going to say for the ceremony, do you wanna hear it?
That was ME!
Sounds nice.
Ah, I was just in the bathroom, and there's mirrors on both sides of you. So when you're in there it's like you're peein' with the Rockettes.
That noise can only me one thing.
So, tell me. Was it like you and Chandler, and then you and me, or you and me and Chandler?
Not in my head.
Oh yeah, sorry about that. Mob mentality or whatever, I don't know...
Okay, uhh, would you rather be too wet or too dry?
And starting to think about settling down!
Whoa! Okay. Yeah well, who-who was in World War I?
When I'm with a woman, I need to know that I'm going out with more people than she is.
What?! He got to do it at your first wedding!
I've gotta see this. All right Ugly Naked Guy!
Hey Mon! Want some pancakes?
Yeah! Yeah. I'll be all right.
Yeah. Whew, it's hot with all of this stuff on. I ah, I better not do any, I don't know, lunges.
Oh my God! Oh! Hey, can I have an aquarium? And a sex swing?
U-U-Um, I think there's been an oversight.
I can't tell you what I'm wishing for! Else...you know...won't come true!
Hey!
Soldier down!
Dude I just did something terrible.
Nah, you're not tall enough to be a Mark, but you might make a good Barney.
Hey, hey.
Look, I'm telling you if I put my hand on my stomach right here it doesn't hurt that bad.
Who's Elaine?
He's kinda tall, dark hair, hand looks exactly like this. See?
Wait a minute! Why don't I do what that guy did? I'll take this $100 and turn it into $5,000! And then I'll turn that into enough money to get my movie going again!
All right! So that's it! It's over! Everybody knows!
Mornin'. I said, mornin'.
Ohh yeah.
Yeah, I just... I just feel bad about firing Estelle. This is got to be killing her.
Okay.
oh why don't you fly out there and surprise him.
Well you gotta kiss someone, you can't kiss your sister.
Aaron! You gotta let me go. The guy's hammered!
Yeah, see... you were all worried for nothing.
Yeah?
We make fire. Cook meat.
I don't know, birds just don't say, "Hello, sit here, eat something."
And?... AND?
Okay.
Okay! All right. Umm, all right Wayne, level with me. Okay? I-I keep hearing all these rumors that I might get fired. Okay, they even have actors coming in to read for my part! Come on man, you-you got to give me a second chance! I mean, I love-I love this little guy! Ah-ah!! Okay, that's why you didn't want me to touch him right? Here you go! Okay? Stupid! I can't believe it! God! Hey, how you doin'?
Oh my God! I overslept! I was supposed to be on the set a half an hour ago! I gotta get out of here!
Joey Tribbiani, a big fan.
Actually I rent the whole place and, I just got what you meant. Thank you.
Name one!
A place to eat spaghetti.
Uh-huh.
Can you believe this place?
Yeah, it must've fallen out a few blocks back. I just figured we hit a dog.
Stop saying good night.
So you uh, nervous about getting married?
Dude!
I'm fine, I'm fine, it's just, it's just weird what's happening with her and Ross. You know, yesterday he asked me to fix him up with somebody.
Listen uh, could you put Kathy on, I wanna apologize.
Okay.
Yeah, sure. Well, you must be new here. Maybe we should-I'm sorry, can I ask you something?
I lie better then that, right?
You bet! What's the part?
I really made you think about that thing uh?
Absolutely! And if it doesn't, can I get the extra ticket?
Fine, I'll rent a car and drive...! Ross, you have to get that job!
Have you kissed her yet? It's awesome! I could do it forever! Y'know what? She-she kisses better than my mom cooks!
All right Pheebs, stick out your plate!
Nice. Oh hey, what about Ross?
Hey guys, so I just called the Powerball hotline, can you believe it? Nobody won.
I couldn't. He was saying all these really nice things about me. I didn't want him to get mad and take 'em all back. I'm on a edge on Chandler.
Oh, man, I'm sorry. Why?
It's not a cat!
Of course he's gonna have his Uncle Joey!
Nothing! It was something.
Why not?
Ross, you should know that my pants are startin' to come down and I'm not wearing any underwear!
Vulva?
Not like we used to. Remember? You and me used to be inseparable. Y'know now it's like...things are different.
Why God?!! Why?!! We had a deal!! Let the others grow old! Not me!!
The reactor's gonna blow in three seconds, we're never gonna make it!
Is he gone?
No.
Here. I need to borrow some moisturizer.
Hm-mmm.
So! You and Phoebe huh? How long have you been going out?
Hey Monica, what's on this video tape?

Dude, two times that happened!
So that if we went out on a date, shed be there.
Uh, does it hurt?
Get your non-believer ass outta my chair!
One.
Ok.
All right, relax. It's just a shoe.
Somebody help me out here!
Oh-ho, you should get inside my head.
What award are you practicing for?
It is so amazing to meet you. I'm such a big fan of your work.
Uh-oh.
Check it out, check it out. Heckles' high school yearbook.
Well, I was Dr. Drake Remoray, Stryker's twin brother. I mean, who looks more me than me right?
Look, I don't know why the kids need a youth center anyway! Y'know? They should just watch TV after school like I did and I turned out fine!
No-no hey buddy, please let me dance with that girl, I really like her and I think I have a shot.
Ooh, that bad, huh?
Hey!
Hiya!
Maybe you changed?
Yeah! And also, a little like a French guy. I never noticed that before.
Sure is.
Okay, listen, hey, Ross. Why don't you try to relax, okay? Maybe have a drink.
It was different for you guys! I mean, I mean, you were both in the same place, right?
Yeah, but sandwich time is right now.
Yeah! Yeah sure, just long as it's handled tastefully and that barn is not too cold.
Nice shoes, huh?
Beth, Beth dies?
All right! Thanks! You're the best! Now listen, the last day of auditions is Thursday. Okay? So I gotta get in there by Thursday. Okay? Just remember Thursday. Thursday. Can you remember Thursday?
Since always. It's like dating language. Y'know, like 'It's not you' means 'It is you'.
Hey Gunther, have you uh, have you seen Chandler?
What are you talking about? Lots of things rhyme with Rachel. Bagel. Mail. Jail. Bail. Able. May-pole.
Okay.
Are you sure?
I'm gonna go down there and teach that guy a lesson.
Yeah! Look!
: Ahhh, that's alright. Y'know, that's a tough hand to beat.
Oh well, she said we have nothing in common.
Come on! Look just-just tell-let her know that you really want them to be there. Let's not forget, this is a woman that has sent you many lasagnas over the years.
Oh man! Aren't you guys done yet?! I wanna sit in my chair!
Yes.
Pick me!!
Oh-oh! I'm stuck!
Oh, it's Ross's bachelor party.
So what are we gonna do?! We have no reinforcements! No-no food!
Yeah? What did ya have?
Ohh, you're upset because you think I chose Ross over you! No! I...knew...you could take care of yourself. Y'know, I mean Ross, he need help. He's not street like us!
Hey Rach, so can I sing happy birthday to you now?
Come on! Who has the biggest boobs?
She's mad because I know today's her laundry day and that means she's wearing her old lady underpants.
Who's your friend? He's hot!
I can't believe I'm going to lose this job!
Uh, Pheebs, you're leaking?
Toutes la smore! Bu blu-ay bloo blah ooh! Pfoof!
That's a nice picture. Maybe you can still have that!
Ok, you're scaring me a little bit.
Oh, Monica and Chandler's recommendation. I want it to sound smart but.. I don't know any big words or anything, so...
Oh, hey, Chandler, we, ah, we stopped by the coffee shop and ran into Ross.
Well, actually the last place you were sitting was in there . Soo...
Movies?
Cookie, now you can punch him!
Oh man, she's so smokin, she has got the greatest set of. . . no guys around, huh.
Probably not. Nah. I don't know how much I'm gonna wanna play after you go.
Yeah.
I know! I know! Come on, please-please you guys, don't-don't be mad. I'm sure she just, she just said that stuff because she was nervous and you guys are like my best friends! Y'know? And it was our first date! Plus, she's really sick!
Yeah-Hey, don't worry, she's a terrific girl. And hey listen, could you do me a favor? When she comes out could you just mention that I'm not looking for a serious relationship; that'd be great.
Anyway, it wasn't the robot, it was the guy who controls him. Yeah, he doesn't like me. He had C.H.E.E.S.E. knock over the sandwich right when I was reaching for one! Ohh!
Oh my God! You're pregnant!
Look, I don't hate Janice, she's-she's just a lot to take, you know.
With a man?
Oh, that's what she meant! You know, if they're gonna shorten it, they should call it the MUSE! You know, short for museum, and avoid all the confusion!
Yeah. With a bite! Gee-e-e-eez!
Althea!
Yeah. Uh, does this mean there's nothing to eat?
Well, ah, I'm an actor. I'm fairly neat. I ah, I got my own TV. Oh, and don't worry I'm totally okay with the gay thing.
No.
Okay.
