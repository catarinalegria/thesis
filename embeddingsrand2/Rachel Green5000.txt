Well, sure...just a sec, though, 'cause Paolo's on his way over.
C'mon, he's right. Tit for tat.
Wh, Ross what do you want from me? You want me, you want me to quit my job so you can feel like you have a girlfriend?
Okay uh, but before you do that. I-I, I need you to talk to me.
Did you watch the tape?
I'm funny? Oh thank God! Well hey, I've got a ton of these! Umm, oh hear-Do you want a good one? Here's a good one. Umm, you uh, you take a quarter, take a quarter and, and you blacken the edge. Right? And then you say to person, I bet you can't roll this quarter from your forehead to your chin without it leaving your face. And then when they do it, they're left with a big black pencil line right down the center of their face.
No! Really, no, please, please, that's, that's okay.
I'm just bummed about the way I left things with Ross. I shouldn't have lied to him about having to work. He seemed so mad at me.
The fear?
Yeah.
Oh ok.
Do you have anything that would... get us out of them?
Cats, how long do they live figuring you don't... y'know, throw 'em under a bus or something?
I don't know. Is it crazy?
Hey.
I screwed up so bad, I told Monica that I would stuff and send all these wedding invitations like weeks ago and I-I...
Hello.
Ok, let me take these cakes back 'cause they're gonna take that out of my paycheck.
No, you're not! Last week you thought Ross was trying to kill you!
I was faking it! Can't you tell when I'm being fake?
Hi! You guys, the car-service just got here. I can't believe they're not home yet! I have to catch my stupid plane. I wanna see the baby!
Okay.
Homo.
Hello? Uh, Rachel. Great, someone is in our apartment. Call the cops!
Hey you!
I've just been thinking about how my baby and I are gonna be all alone.
Ugh.
Not for me. Chip and I broke up!
Well I love you too.
...you were 50 minutes late to the class, what did you crawl there?!
Oh.
Aah... I bet you're right.
Chandler, what are you doing?
Summer catalogue!
Oh, shoot. I had it. Oh, I can't believe this.
Well-well, I don't know Ross-really?
Are you drunk?!
Ohh, whoa God! Storage rooms give me the creeps! Monica, come on please hurry up honey! Please?
Oh we were, but that was just a , I mean that was just a big drunken mistake.
Chandler!! Are you gonna call her!
Ohh, you've waited soo long.
Oh.
That's right, I wanna do it with you! I've been trying to fight it, but you just said all the right things.
Oh-oh, sorry, it's this way, it's this way.
Ugh, she is a slut!
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's just...It's just so sad!
No! Nothing!
Okay, just give me the damn drops!
Well, that-that's not your choice. Happy Halloween!
Look Amy, it got a little of control..Um.. and I'm sorry. You're my sister and uh.. if it really means that much to you..
Yeah, you got like 14 hours until she has to be at the airport, and you're sitting here in the hallway with a 28-year-old cheerleader with a fat lip.
30 seconds, okay.
No.
Nothing! Oh God, we're just so excited that you want to get this apartment!
No no no no no. You wanted me to take them down, so... ..Im takin em down. Okay? Whoa!
Hey-hey-hey that's funny! Your funny Chandler! Your a funny guy! You wanna know what else is really funny?!
Oh stupid metric system!
Absolutely.
Jeez!
My God. Okay. Ha-ha-ha beat ya! Sucker!
Yeah but, you don't, you don't, you don't want to try to much too fast. Y'know? I mean, you do remember what happened to the little girl that tried to much too fast don't you?
Well now it's an empty bar.
All right.
Can any of you watch Emma?
Oh yeah? Another night of birdogging the chickas?
Hey! Is Ross still here?
Honey, Monica, this is ridiculous! Look...
Say more things like that.
Well, what's the other thing, what do I think?
Will you stop calling it your apartment!
Aw, it's unbelievable! Wow! She is kicking so much! Oh, she's like umm...oh...who's that kind of annoying girl soccer player?
Ooh, I can do that.
Yeah. You're not gonna end up alone.
What? Oh my God! I'm so sorry. Joey? Are you ok?
I'm not moving! Is that picture straight?
Right!
Joey? Could you get that? What are you doing here? I thought you were in your room?
Well maybe, maybe she's with us right now?
I don't care, I'm not going anywhere.
What? Wait a minute. What are you saying, that I'm a pushover? I'm not a pushover.
God, isn't this exciting? I earned this. I wiped tables for it, I steamed milk for it, and it was totally not worth it. Who's FICA? Why's he getting all my money? I mean, what- Chandler, look at that.
No, I was waiting for you!
Yeah, he broke those too.
Okay.
Oh, it's a tattoo! That's weird, Phoebe doesn't... Wait that's Ursula! That's not Phoebe that is Ursula!
I don't know, y'know? I feel a little umm... No, y'know what? Nevermind, I'm gonna be fine.
No Ross!! Don't! You can't just kiss me and think you're gonna make it all go away, okay? It doesn't work that way. It doesn't just make it better. Okay?
Yeah.
And so bad. I don't even know what you're talking about because I didn't ask you to do anything!
Hi! Will, right?
All right, all right, well you just blew your chances at dating Bob!
Hey!
Oh, Ross, c'mon, please! Don't make this harder than it already is!
Oh!
What is this? What are we doing?
What what what what?
Babies don't care if they're slim.
Y'know Joey, I could teach you to sail if you want.
Thank you. Well, I guess we have some time to kill.
Oh, come on now, don't keep me waiting. Get those clothes off! But, I would keep that helmet on because you're in for a rough ride!
Good for you Pheebs!
Hey! How's it going? Did you make any new friends?
Okay Ross, can I uh, can I ask you something?
Oh it's umm, it's tofu cake. Do you want some?
Hey, what's-what's going on?!
Oh well, too late, sorry, you already had some.
And Ross.
Do you have to go?
Wh-whoa! All right, okay-okay, I see, I see what's going on here! Now listen, look-look, I'm sorry if I gave you the wrong impression, but I am not some hussy who will just sleep around to get ahead! Now even though I , hey-hey-hey, even though I kissed you, that does not give you the right to demand sex from me. I do not want, this job that bad. Good day, sir.
Anyway, they want to take us out Saturday night! What do you say?
Hi! Excuse us.
Joey, why wouldn't you invite us to your parties?
No, no, no, you said, "got the keys".
Hi!
No.
Oh no, Baby Girl Geller-Green.
Oh my God! We have to throw her a shower?!
No! Shoot, Dr. Schiff what kind of question is that?!
Monica, let it go.
Uh, yeah, well, see, he... Joey knows, that I'm-I'm very insecure about my back and, and...you're hugging me, so obviously you are not repulsed by it, yeah!
We don't want it-it to be too much, we want it to be subtle.
That's right! 'Cause that would give him the control! So now he's all ooh, coming up with this whole I've got a party thing y'know, trying to get me to hint around for an invitation. Blew up in his face, didn't it?
I don't understand! Last time you went out with her you said she was a 'big, dull dud.'
We'll take Literature!!
Oh, yeah go ahead.
No awareness.
Really?
Yeah! That's Phoebe. That's Phoebe. You know, she just wants them all! It's like she's a nympho!
Uh, morning. Do you guys think you could close your eyes for just a sec?
Just a touch. Mon, I don't understand. I mean, you've been dating this guy since like, what... his midterms? I mean, why all the sudden are you so... Oh.
Oh yeah. Okay, see mom, the truth is I can do this on my own.
I'll tell ya who should be embarrassed! It's you guys! Come on! This is ridiculous! Thank you very much, but I do not need you to get me a date!
I'm just kidding! You can go pee!
No. But she did give us some ideas on how to induce labor.
You gave them to me!
It's not a purse! It's a shoulder bag.
All right, how about I go over there and I will walk into Chandler's bedroom and I will see that thing that I think that I know is actually the thing that I think that I know!
Ohh...
We have to have a surprise Bon Voyage party for Emily. But it's actually for Joshua. Look, he said he's not ready to date, so I had to invite him to a party if I wanted to see him outside of work, and now I have the perfect opportunity to seduce him!
Oh man!
Well, it was good.. until we got back to our apartment, and then we were fooling around and he started to put his hand up my leg and I kept slapping it away!
The logic is, that there are two of us and we are both strong enough to break a chair in half!
Ross, you're like my best friend.
Wow! I don't remember him. Honey, are you sure you're not talking about your imaginary boyfriend.
Well, get back in there and talk!
It's not the time Charlie.
Yeah.
And that was so sweet of you to ask! Oh my God, the three of us are gonna have such a good time living together!
Why? Is he? He is! Isn't he? He's dating that slut in marketing!
Oh, all right. But y'know I gotta say, I don't, I don't think six years counts as an era.
I can do that. I certainly did it when we were going out.
Patrick and I had such a great time last night! I mean I think this could maybe turn into something serious.
Yeah, not girls anyway, guys agree like that.
No, I'm not.
Who is being loud?
Yes, so close. Mrs. Lynch, I know that this is an emotional and difficult time, for all of us. But by any chance did Joanna send any paperwork your way before... it happened.
Okay.
Just tell Joey that you watched the tape and you liked it, but your bosses didn't. Then that way, you're the good guy and they're the bad guys.
Settle what?
Okay, listen, I'm thinking, why don't we just tell them who we really are? I mean, it'll be fine, I really think it'll be fine.
Goodnight.
Oh my God.
Really?!
Whatever Linus, I'm opening mine.
Oh no.
Yeah, it's just y'know...
Oh, he is precious! Where did you get him?
Good night.
Oh.
Okay, now make it even, 'cause we don't...
Yeah, you know, was I looking forward to going to Paris? Sure. You know, was I excited about working in the fashion capital of the world? Ooh, absolutely... Oh...! Yeah, but you know, this is... it's fine. I'm fine going back to a job where I've pretty much gotten everything out of that I possibly can...
Now, that-that was a good thing that I told you, right?
And so were-were you close to your parents?
Tag...
Oh well actually gonna use a nanny and uh, I don't even have a housekeeper.
I don't know Tag! How can your genitals make phone calls? Okay? It's not a perfect world! Just go please.
Hi, Pheebs.
Mon, honey, I gotta ask you something.
Okay, okay, okay.
Sucker!
Oh come on Ross, we've done it before we'll do it again, it'll be a nice way to bookend the pregnancy.
Don't!! Honey, what are you doing here?!
Really! God Ross, what were you thinking? I know it's really shallow, but a part of me wants him again.
Oh thanks, but listen, I was just at Monica's and she and Chandler had a big fight and they're not moving in.
Good different?
Ross, you don't even have oven mitts on!
I did not know you spoke French.
Irrational, huh? All right, well, I'll remember that the next time you freak out about a spider in your apartment!
Oh!!
Well I-I think your wrong.
Oh-oh! Okay, she's kicking!
Oh please, he'll be with his real family, the twins and little miss new boobs.
Really? You think so?
Yeah, I guess Gunther is kinda...
Now wait a minute. You just took all the words!
That's all right.
No. I was just going to do this myself.
Okay, but before you go, could you help me first?
Oh my God, Phoebe, are you gonna go to jail?!
Huh.
Well, yeah, y'know how Ross and I were on again, off again, on again, off again? I guess I just figured that somewhere down the road, we would be on again.
Oh Pheebs, is that a new ankle bracelet?
Excellent!
Hi!
Oh, well, I guess I had that one coming. I'm just gonna throw it out, it's probably just a bunch of shampoo and...
I'm sorry honey, what were you saying?
It's so not a big deal!
WHAT?
Time is money my friend?
Hey Phoebe, can I talk to you for a second?
Yeah, I...
Uh-huh... why... do you not like them?
Well I-I-I'm not moving.
Yeah so get ready to hear alot of ehm...boohaki, goshdarnit and brotherpucker.
Okay, umm, I'm gonna get my sweater.
Okay.
Oh, thanks.
There was a woman at the... The stripper?!
Oh, you're one of those. But y'know what? I have two sisters of my own and we just-just tortured each other.
How are you?
You brought a carrot?!
Hi Pheebs!
I'm not! We're having a girl! Sometimes I can't believe it's with you-But still! We're having a girl!
Ohh...
Huh... OH MY GOD IT'S BRUSSELS SPROUTS.
Well y'know what they say, the 23rd time's the charm. Aww, look at you all handsome!
It sure is.
Oh honey, but it is just about...
3-2-1 oh!!
Yeah.
Hi! So I just dropped Emma off at my mom's.
Oh, I wish he was a doll, then I could get a Rachel doll and bump them together and make kissy noises. Oh! And he has the most beautiful name, I never realised it, Joshua! Josh-u-a! Joshua! Josh.
Thank God.
What?! You kissed!
Okay.
Phoebe the father is not here okay? I haven't told him yet and I don't think I can tell him at all now!
You remember when we got these?
Well, maybe-maybe I could be your roommate Pheebs.
Oh, great!
Okay.
No..!
I wanna sleep, I wanna eat, I wanna take a shower, I mean before she wakes up and we gotta do this all over again.
What, what's it, what's going on?
Hi!
Oh, don't be such a baby! end.
I don't know, I mean, this is just my initial gut feeling... but I'm thinking... oh, I'm thinking it'd be really great.
What?
Oh, God! Please, somebody say something.
Hey Ross! Any word on the apartment yet?
Ok, Monica. I just have to know one thing. Did you go with her to Bloomingdale's? Oh! Ok, ok, ok, I just really, uh, I just really need to not be with you right now.
Okay. Okay, that's him! That's him! That's Cujo! That's Cujo!
Oh, okay.
Oh! What are we gonna do?
Hey, hey, hey, hey, quit making up rules!
They're not!! Ross, they're just saving them for the important people!! Okay?! What-what if I was the president?!
Hmmm....
Chandler told me.
Listen honey, can you keep dad occupied, I'm gonna go talk to mom for a while.
What are these?
Ross.
Well, let's see. The first one is: I don't want to. And, you know, I'm not going.
Ohhh! That is soo sweet!
No, it's just that uhm... it feels so good... Ikea... Yeah, say hey, you'll know this, what's the capital of Sweden?
Here you go.
Hey! Joey, would you mind giving me and Ross a hand moving his couch?
Surprise me.
No, it's Ross. It's Ross. You like Ross. Oh daddy, I hope you're okay with all of this. I mean think about it, this is a good thing. You're gonna-This is your first grandchild! You're gonna be a poppy!
Hey.
Oh come on Ross!!
I know.
Well, isn't that a good thing? You said you were sick of this.
Yeah Phoebe, I completely understand.
Ok.
Joey, would you just come out here and stop being such a baby!
What's the other one?
Okay.
They do!
Oh hi, Mr. Wineburg, hi Mrs. Wineburg.
Oh.
I lent them to Ross.
Because she hates Pottery Barn.
Hey!
Now I love you even more.
I-I forgot my underwear.
What's the matter?
Ohhhh!
Chandler, you have an assistant right?
Yeah. No. And you know what? Nobody even saw!
Phoebe hates Pottery Barn?!
Ross! What are you... I'm sorry sir. I just, I think he just really likes you.
Alright, alright look, just uh... just try to remember how you felt when you were in love, and think about that when you're playing the scene.
No, I-I just don't know how you decide who to hire. I mean I've got it narrowed down to two people. One of them has great references and a lot of experience and then there's this guy...
Come on Ross! You said you wanted to talk about it, let's talk about it!! How was she?
You guys are unbelievable. No! He cannot come.
We're sorry.
Um, seven...e-e-eight, eight years. Wow.
Oh wait, I have the ten of spades! Here!
Oh yes! Thank you very much! Oh that's-that's actually how the French drink it.
Well, the point is, maybe I should just stop waiting around for moments with Ross, you know? I should just . . . move on with my life.
Yes, we should. I think we should.
Whoa! Y'know what Katie? I gotta tell ya I-I-I-I think you are the one who is too much.
Hi!
Oh yeah he's too cute to be straight.
Oh no...
I can't believe I ever even tried to help you. You are so beyond help.
When she sees that you're gone, she's gonna know that I let you out, and that I was in here, and I'm gonna get fired!
Oh Amy, you remember Ross.
Oh I...
I can't say that I'm surprised.
Ooh, I just wish we hadn't lost those four months, but if time was what you needed just to gain a little perspective...
Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, this is so stupid! I mean, I gave Barry up, right? I should be happy for them! I am, I'm happy for them.
Uh-huh, go on.
Wait a minute! Wait a minute! I'm not saying that you shouldn't have a bag, I just-it's just there are other bags that are a little less umm, controversial.
Coffee.
I mean I think I'd say no to anybody right now. Oh, but it was so strange. I mean I'm standing there with this charming, cute guy, who's asking me to go out with him, which I'm allowed to do, and I felt guilty. Y'know, like I'd be cheating on Ross or something.
Wh-Phoebe!!
I just, I feel, I-I just...
Take it back!
Allll done!
Oh no, yes I do! I do! I mean, come on go on, you were, you were saying I am happier when uh, y'know?
No. Thank you.
Oh!
You promised you would break up with her!
Ok, Paulo, why don't you just go get dressed, and then you be on your way, ok, bye-bye.
I know. Oh-oh, wait did you hear that-hear that? Listen, I'm gettin' something from your grandmother, she said that since you get to keep the one bedroom apartment you should give Rachel the purple chair?
Because a car backfired?
It wouldn't have mattered anyway, Phoebe, you and I are, are gonna live together, we're roommates; that's the deal.
Hi!
That's fine!
So, is this just gonna be you and Carol?
Okay!
Hi! Is my misery amusing to you?
Alright. Well then how about I call your supervisor, and I tell her that you shot my friend in the ass with a dart?
Joey, had reasons.
He's not 11!
How...how...?
Well, if it makes you feel any better, I made a fool out of myself.
Oh thank you so much Mr. Kaplan, thank you so much.
Okay.
I'm not?
Oh my God, honey that's great.
I think I just shipped 3,000 bras to personnel. Oh honey, I gotta go. Mark, I need you!
Ohh, thank you.
Great!! That's great!
And if it's a girl?
Hi, my name is Rachel Green, I have an appointment for Emma.
Yeah, right, he almost danced me right down that...garbage chute.
So shake it!
No, I-I-I love it there.
Because I promised Mindy I would.
He's like a big disgusting...
Uh-hmm.
How do you know that? What if it just gets worse and worse and worse, to the point where we can't even be in the same room with each other?!
Oh, great, Are you gonna be ok?
Hello? Like he was really gonna send you one? She was a big girl.
Hi.
I'm sorry, I was just reading the joke below it. Man, that one is funny.
I don't know, you know, just the way she waltzed in here all smart, and tall! You know, and just swept Joey off his feet... I mean, nobody else has a chance!
You wanna go in the bedroom? It's a little more comfortable.
Airport, airport. Ross, not alone, Julie, arm around her. Cramp, cramp.
Pheebs, that's for men!
We have to get her a present?!
What?!
Wo-women? You mean like old women?
Uh-huh.
Woow!I haven't seen you this worked up since you did that dog food commercial and you thought you were gonna be with a real talking dog!
No! You gotta hold my hand!!
I cannot believe I'm gonna meet Jessica Ashley!
Okay Ross, we're-wait a minute. Umm, I uh, I kinda have a little confession.
Do you even know who Kip is?
what?
Chandler, relax, Chandler, she'll be here.
No, no, ACC-cept that.
I'm so dead serious. I'm totally serious.
Wow, y'know if Joey and Chandler walked in right now, we could make a fortune!
Oh, yeah sure, Ok.
Okay, you gotta give me some of your piece.
Oh, god.
You didn't get it?
Ugh!
I will wake you up in a way that's proved very popular in the past.
Joey.
Okay.
Why not?
Never happened! Good night!
Yes.
Oh, I don't know. Well maybe it's just the idea of Barry for the rest of my life. I don't know I think I feel like I need to have one last fling, y'know, just to sorta get it out of my system.
Really?
Well, Phoebe set me up on a date.
What?
No reason.
Okay, then y'know what? Help me! I need help! I can't do this!
I know, isn't he great? It's so nice to finally be in a fun relationship, y'know? There's nothing boring about him, and ah, I bet he's never set foot in a museum.
Okay.
We?!
Well that sounds fun too.
Oh yeah, sorry. Wait honey, so what did you do that made dad cut you off?
You can't, because of the new skylight!
I just- I don't think us getting back together is a good idea.
Ohhh! Wow! He kinda takes your breath away doesn't he?
You know, actually it's more like, hi.
Well said. And a uh good example of the fun I was referring to uhh, but I just think I'm past the point where I think I can y'know, just have fun.
Well, it's embarrassing. People were looking at us like we were crazy.
Yes! On a cake shaped like a bunny.
Oh, I love to ski! How amazing is this?!
Oh, hi Mr. Zelner.
Well obviously I won't be able to come, for those of you who haven't checked their calendars today is my due date. Well y'know, I just want to take a moment and thank you guys for how great you've been during this time. I really couldn't have done it without you. And I have loved these last nine months! And even though I am so looking forward to the next part, I am really gonna miss being pregnant.
Ohh! It's so nice to meet you. Hello.
One hour.
Nothing! Oh God, we're just so excited that you want to get this apartment!
Hey. I've got something that's gonna make you happy. Guess what Gunther found?
All right! Ross, do you think it's easy for me to see you with somebody else?
Monica.
Yeah, that's gonna get you into Soap Opera Digest. Well I......I would just like to say that Joey truly has enriched the days of our lives.
All right? Thank you.
What? Yeti-I mean Danny?
Diane Keeton.
Hey, this is hollow.
Oh my God! It sure didn't look this way when I lived here.
Oh come--Of course I know that. I mean of course you never leave a baby alone! I mean who would-she wouldn't be safe as she would be with me, the baby dummy. Oh God, okay. Y'know what? I think opening the presents right now is a little overwhelming right now. So I think umm, I'm just gonna maybe open them a little bit later, but thank you all for coming. And for these beautiful gifts, and this basket is beautiful.
Yeah, I guess. I-I... I mean, do-do you think we're ever gonna have that?
Oh my God! Was she old? Does she have a view?
Well, y'know, sometimes that helps.
Yes! Y-E-S. Yes!
Oh, I'm sorry.
Yeah, I forget which ones.
What?! What?!
Should I be concerned that a button fell off the old Hugsy and I can't find it?
Yeah.
Honey, it's going to be okay. He's been incredibly supportive of me, and if he gets a little upset; that's what the meatball sub is for.
Ross, you are so pathetic. Why can't your son just play with his doll?
I know isn't it? It's like I'm right there with Joshua.
Uh-huh.
Well, you're not sixteen, you're both adults now.
Okay. Well, I gotta go you guys. I'll see you later.
Oh but Joey, I have to go. There's no room for a baby here.
But honey, I think she's moving in with Chandler.
Yeah.
Yes! I will! Absolutely! Hello, Rachel. Hi, Joshua. I left my wallet here on purpose. Really? Yes, I just wanted to see you again. Oh, I'm glad. Rachel, I'd like to say something to you. Yes? How you doin'?
Oh! Right! Yeah! Hold on, I'll be just clean up in here a little bit! Hello Gavin.
Oh Ross, you're so great.
Are you serious?
So you're gonna be in the car, I will be upstairs, and that's where everybody's gonna be!
I did not sell you out.
Ok, well Monica, suppose one of your "special" tickets win? How are you gonna feel when you win the lottery and you lose all your friends?
Are you serious?
"Yeah. That works for me."
And you weren't going to tell us? How did you think you were gonna get away with that?
Ooh, Pheebs, what are you gonna say? Are you gonna tell him who you are?
Joey! I can't believe you just did that!
Tommy's supposed to be here soon, we're going to lunch.
No, forget it.
I don't wanna stand in the way of true love or anything, but I think a cantaloupe might hurt less.
Okay, you'd tell me the truth. Right?
Oh yeah.
And-Joey!
Well, I don't know, you guys figure it out, I got to put Emma down for a nap.
Well, this is going well.
Late thirties? Oh come on you guys! Is it just me? Am I overreacting to this?
I haven't seen it yet!
Oh they are nice. We-we custom-make tuxedos for celebrities and then when they're done with them they just send 'em back.
Oh my God, Melissa Warburton. I don't think I have the energy for this.
Okay so listen I'm gonna go lay down.
Well, there's two spots left right?
It's Joshua.
Oh my God. And that works?!
No its really okay... Monica!
Hm-mmm!
How was the honeymoon? Phoebe; Oh, incredible! Oh! Champagne, candle-lit dinners, moonlight walks on the beach, it was sooo ro-man-tic!
Do you want me to quit?
Any chance you think the couch looks good there?
Oh wow, you are really, you're really a creep.
You are. Well, um... We, we, we were just... Wow!
Okay, fine.
Hey. I need to tell you something.
That's right, still no baby! Come on people! Please make some room!
I'm sorry. I didn't-I don't come in here a lot.
Jill?
Oh my God, what a great surprise! This is such a beautiful house.
Y'know, I-I gotta tell ya, those eye drops are a miracle. My eye is a 100% better.
Oh no Ross! This is not good, we have to talk about this Joey thing. Please sit. You have got to get over this Joey thing, okay? I never really wanted to marry Joey, okay?
What? Why? Where are you?
Thank you. Oh Joey and look at this crib! It's so cute!
Yeah I don't think dressing provocatively is going to help me here! Oh my god just please take her.
I don't have ten minutes!!
Okay, you want me to stop at the ATM?
Mmh-mmh!
Oh, I'm sure gonna miss pretending to laugh at your weird jokes that I don't get.
That's right. You're very cheeky for a temp.
Exactly! Unisex!
No-no, they're not very nice people.
...I really don't...
Y'know what, I-I have to go talk to her, would you let me just get changed?
What? Wait, what?
What?
I don't know, I don't know. Urrrgh! Look, maybe we should take a break.
Right.
well, now, wait a second, who did I just put as my "In case of emergency" person?
All right, cut, let's pick again, pick again.
Um... hi.
I knew it! I knew it, ahh....
What's up Joe?
Hi! Wow! You look, you look...big.
Well no.
Well, Phoebe that's fine because I'm not moving.
You know we were all alone and he was being really nice to me and, oh and he gave me this scarf...
Really?! Got a little crush on Tag there do ya?
Ben just said hi.
Oh, hey! Hi, there you are, I've been looking for you everywhere!
Yes, I'll meet 'em.
Yes, Ross.
No. But don't worry, I'm sure they're still there.
Ross I-We tried all the spicy food. It's not working.
I did not sell you out.
Anybody wanna trade? Oh...
Yeah, so?
Oh, I've got big Valentine's plans! I've got my Chinese food on the way, and the rest of your saltwater taffy!
We got locked out of the apartment, we ...
Ross, please, don't be so scared of him!
Here.
Ooh, ooh, ooh,ooh,ooh. Hi.
Ah. Oh.
You're a pathetic loser, right?
She dropped off a casserole?
Ohhh, OK.
What? Come on, it's not like I'm asking for this girly clock or anything, which, by the way, I also think is very cool.
Hey!
Hey, you guys! Guess what? Barry and Mindy are getting a divorce!
Are you gonna let me play?
Vrrbddy, the bll is drrbing.
Yeah. Yeah, I-I-I see the scare. Listen, Paul, I think this is really great that-that y'know, you shared your feelings. It's really, it's beautiful, but umm, what do you say we go share some food?
Well, yeah, right, y'know what? Yeah, you're right, I mean, we no, we have our fun. Yeah! But if ......I mean, I mean like craaaazy! Y'know? Okay, all right. This is gonna, this is gonna sound y'know, a little umm, hasty, but uh, just go with it. Umm. Ugh. What if we got married?
Hey!
Oh, get out of here!
Oh, I know it. You're right. That's not sexy. Oh...Oh! Whoops! Oh, I seem to have dropped my fork. Let me just bed over and get it. Oh God!
'Kay. Congratulations on your new job.
You're just staring into space.
Joey, honey, I don't think you're supposed to go back there.
Ooh, is this one of those things where you throw it in a bag with some graveyard dirt and hang it from a north-facing tree?
Hi boots.
God I know, you're right.
So what?! Y'know what? The way I see it--Ow! Son of a bitch!!
I am not a pushover!
Well, I would like to have the option!!
Well, so, why don't you just turn it off?
Okay!
Right. Right.
Since when?
No! I'm so happy for them!
Well, actually...
All right, I promise. I'll fix this. I swear. I'll-I'll-I'll-I'll talk to her.
Yeah.
I don't know, something either trees or disease-Ralph mumbles a lot.
Ugh, Monica I don't want to steal your stupid thunder!
Nooo Way! The most romantic song ever is The Way We Were.
Wow! What's that like?
No, I couldn't let you do that.
We were on a break!
Right!
Okay.
Yeah.
Hey!
Oh, Joey, come on! Please, please! Let me come, I will behave, I promise! I will behave! Please, please, please...
What are you talking about, Ross, you just said that you read it twice! Look, y'know what, either it does or it doesn't, and if you have to even think about it...
There is a hardware store right down the street?
What do you really want to do?
Oh, come on Ross...
Yeah me too. oh! I have an idea. Why don't we all pitch in 50 bucks, we'll pool our money together and then if we win, we'll split it! Everyone almost simultaneously except Ross: yeah thats a great idea!
And everybody knows this?
Well, I have to say that earns tutu pieces of candy.
Oh, of course!
You know what, I'm gonna do that, I'm gonna call him up, and I'm gonna ask him out. I can do that. Ask him out. How you doin'? Hi! Joshua? It's Rachel Green from Bloomingdale's. Yeah, umm, I was wondering if you umm, if you umm, left your wallet at the store today? Well, we found a wallet, and we- the license? Well, that is a good idea! Uh, well, let's see here this says this license belongs to a uh, uh, belongs to a mister uh, Pheebs, and umm, yeah, so sorry to bother you at home. I'll see you tomorrow. Bye. You've done that a thousand times?
Oh, I read that in high school.
Okay. God y'know, if someone told me a week ago that I would be peeing in Joey Tribbiani's apartment...
You went shopping for fur?
Oh, no no no no. Oh no no no no. I have to do this to her?
Hey!
Okay! Okay! Here!
Sure! Oh...
So it seemed that my prom date had stood me up, so Ross selflessly, offered to take me.
Joey, is this that thing that you do when you say you're bad so I'll give you a compliment?
Well! Good night. I'm going upstairs.
You stole the phone!
Well, I-I-I don't know how this fits into your whole "seizing" thing but um, Emily called you today.
Mom that's okay that you didn't get you a gift!
Oh, okay. Will you take my place?
Shake it!
God, I hope he doesn't show up. Of course he's not gonna show up, the guy hates me.
Oh, okay. Is that what you want to do? You wanna go over and give a little shout out to the old, hot chickas? Okay, let's do that Sailor Joe. Quick question though, what's this called?
Yes it is! I saw you guys going at it behind the card catalog!
Hi!
Ohh, thank you, thank you, thank you.
I know, I just didn't want to wear my glasses on my first date.
What's up?
Give me that!
No.
Yeah, I did, but y'know what? I am really, really trying to cut back, y'know? Good luck, Rach.
No!
How are you?
Pheebs?
What?
Oh! That would be sooo much fun!
Please! We did not fog Danny! Who's Danny?
I know. I'm sorry. Look, I'll make a deal with you all right? Okay?
Oh my God! Oh my God! I can't go! I'm gonna be too nervous!
I can't do this.
Joey, you have got to take this back!
Ahh... Chandler's on the couch!!
Alright, fine. You can keep it. As long as you don't mind that she's haunted.
Well, this sounds like fun! Well, you know what? Actually? People are getting a little antsy waiting Emma to wake up from her nap, so would you mind performing them once now?
Oh yeah! Of course, I mean, she's gonna get over this, y'know? I mean, so you said my name! Y'know you just said it 'cause you saw me there, if you'd have seen a circus freak, you would've said, "I take thee circus freak." Y'know, it didn't mean anything, it's just a mistake. It didn't mean anything. Right?
I guess so.
Now the filet mignon, what comes with that?
Why didn't you get it?
Did you just break the radiator?
What?
Uhh, let's just stay clear of 'I'm the guy that's doing you daughter' and you should be ok.
Yes!!
Maybe. I-I don't know-Oh God, how could I be so stupid?!
Umm...
Yeah. Yeah. Definitely, well it definitely took me by surprise, but I'm okay.
Come on! You guys can pee standing up.
What?
Okay. Ah, well we'll just see about that, okay. I will read The Shining, and you will read Little Women.
Good luck.
He's perfect, he's never been better.
Ross!
Yeah.
Oh. Right. ...Oh great.
OK, then get me your purse.
Later! La...
Eh. Beth dies.
I'm-I'm-I had no idea. I'm sorry. I...
Oh my God! Joey Tribbiani from Days of Our Lives, just walked in here!
That is the most ridiculous.
Wow... Wow!
MONICA!!!! MONICA!!!!
Oh.
What are you doing?
Hi!
I know!
Come on see, she doesn't look that bad.
Okay, okay, could we change the subject, please?
I promise.
14?
Hmm-mmm.
No, come on, I'm totally ok. I don't need you to come! I can totally handle this on my own.
Yeah.
Ok, Ross, Ross, ok listen, what we have is amazing.
Ehh, pardon me?
OK, OK. I'm with you, Cheech. OK.
Pheebs is your grandmother maybe saying that you should live here alone?
Oh, you're not gonna tell the whole story about how your parents got divorced again are you?
Yeah, I admit it. I have a crush on you, and uh, and, and I know that's crazy because we work together, and-and nothing could ever happen, and the last thing I want to do is-is to freak you out or make you feel uncomfortable. Which is why it would be really great if you said something right about now.
Right,.. well,.. we never actually got to that... Oh, it was just so nice to see him again, y'know? It was comfortable, it was familiar... it was just nice!
Oh we did, but my mom got us the greatest gift of all.
Okay. Hey. Umm. Does everybody hate these shoes?
Does it?
No! No-no, I love it. Thank you.
Get off.
Okay.
Okay! Okay! Listen to what Sean McMahon wrote in my yearbook senior year, "Dear Rach, you're such a good person." Not girl! Person!
Ugh! Get out! Get out! Go! Come on! No! Not in there! He's in there!
Hey Joey, what would you do if someone that you slept with told you that she was pregnant?
What?! Are you crazy?
We feel so terrible about this, Ross.
Wow, Ikea... what a rich culture. Uhm, you know what? I have a friend who is a masseuse.
"Oh, my, god."
Oh, that's what this is all about? Did you bring her up here to get back at me?
I know!
No honey, okay, okay, you wanna know why Ross canceled the date? Because I asked him to.
And umm, vintage handkerchiefs y'know 'cause, people cry at weddings. I'm just gonna grab a couple of these.
No, I can't, I have a baby.
Oh my God you're amazing! Did you just pull that out of her purse?
Uh-huh.
Oh Ross, you're so great!
Okay. Thank you! Thank you! Because-I'm sorry, all right. Because y'know what? She didn't want me-not important. The point is, I was right. Your decision. Okay? I was right. Your decision.
Is the window open? Because if there's a window open, a bird could fly in there.
Whoa! Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Oh God. You know what? Who you think you are? Who are you to decide what messages I should or should not get?
Well, you know I'm not surprised. I mean have you seen them together, they're really cute.
Thank you.
Ahhhh!!
I'm just gonna go in my office and pick up some stuff . Who the hell are you!?
Oh, it's so sad they never had a chance to meet.
Ok, Well, what about these are white cotton panties. Would they go with whites or delicates?
Okay!
Really?
Oh, oh thanks. Alright well, now that I'm up I'm going to go to the bathroom.
Well I. . .
Ok.
I didn't write it.
She's right. She's right. You are no different than the rest of them.
Oh, alright. The weirdest place would have to be... ... oh, the foot of the bed.
Hey...
See look Amy, we're a lot closer to Monica and Chandler. We see them every day. And truthfully honey, you don't seem very connected to the baby.
Oh my God, Oh my God, here comes Ross. He's gonna flip out.
I-I-I-I'm just...I'm just a good kisser!
On Melanie Griffith in "Working girl". I think what you want is over here.
Mhm-mh!
Okay, I'm sorry.
Wow! Well, clearly this is not a good time.
Ohhh!!!
Oh, come on! You think that's gonna work on me?! I invented that!
Oh yes, absolutely! Y'know, it's weird uh, but I had a dream last night where I was stopped by a policeman. And then he uh...well I probably shouldn't tell you the rest.
I can see that. You look like you slept with a hanger in your mouth.
Close call day.
Oh dear God.
Oh my God!
Sorry, I just uhm... I can't seem to get Ross out of my head...
I'm the hell person whose office this is!
Really? Really?!
Do you guys want these?
And your fly's still open...
OK, listen, I'm sorry about last night and I really want to make it up to you.
Oh, I don't think she likes the new Hugsy.
Ohh, gosh. You guys, come on, this is-I have to meet Joshua! This is my one chance for him to see the fun Rachel. Y'know the "Wouldn't it be great if she was my wife" Rachel. Ohh, all right! Are Joey and Chandler back?
Oh sure.
Oh my God, Monica's gonna go out with a millionaire.
Oh but he did say that they found the grandmother wandering down fifth avenue.
Oh!
Okay, no, that's not the right decision. That's not, that's not right, no Ross-Ross, come on! I mean, that woman made you miserable! Okay, Ross, do you really want to get back into that?
Ok, I'm sorry, I'm just not very good with babies. I mean I haven't been around them, I mean, you know, since I was one.
Not working with me, Joe! Here's the thing: lately I have been having thoughts musings, if you will!
Right!
Yes! Yes! Yes, I do! I do know! Frank and Alice are gonna want to keep all of their children!
Ahh. Thank you!
OOooooo!
Can you believe this is already happening? I mean it seems like yesterday they just got engaged.
Joey! We should just switch.
How often do you read it?
Oooooooooh. Oh, that's nice. Oh, oh. Huh, Ross!
Let me see that. Oh, yeah.
No, it's not gonna be okay Ross, tomorrow is my last day, and I don't have a lead. Okay, y'know what, I'm just gonna, I'm just gonna call Gunther and I'm gonna tell him, I'm not quitting.
I ah, will buy and wrap all of your Christmas gifts.
Oh as, as opposed to your other multi-functional nipples?
Alright thanks, oh Ross could you stop by the coffee house and get me a muffin?
Basically, there's the thing, and then there's the stuff after the thing.
Oh.
What the... DIAL IT DOWN! Listen, ok, and maybe they're crazy thoughts, but sometimes I do, I have, I've been thinking about... you know, us! Ok, dial it up a little!
Why didn't I get that message?
Oh no, yeah.
Well...
Yeah. A year ago..
Oh yeah? Startin' to feel her again there are we?
I'm gonna do it too!
Ok Sexy, sexy, very sexy, sexy. Alright! Lets do it!
Or Carol! But they're funny to kids and who is it hurting?!
Oh! Shoot! Damn it! Where is it? Oh! Oh! I found it! I found it!
Ok, so let's talk money.
They're male nurses.
Well I was gonna tell him that I'm-I'm gonna have the baby and he can be as involved as he wants.
You're so pretty.
Well, because if one more person says "what a cute little boy" I'm gonna whip them with a car antenna!
Joey.
Here, kitty-kitty. Here kitty-kitty. Where did you go, little kitty-kitty-kitty? Here kitty-kitty-kitty-kitty...
You know what? We should call my mum's house and say goodnight to Emma before she goes down.
That is so sad. Your missing out on so much, Ross. I mean, the bonding and the sharing, you know. And-and knowing that someone else is going through the same thing you are.
Okay, uh...
Yeah.
Yes, we are very sorry to tell you this, but you, Phoebe, are flaky.
Is this a little too... Pheebs, what happened?
Did you not get a good enough look the other day?
Joey I don't think you know what behalf means.
Well how can that be, you were just kissing Sabrina?
Yeah-yeah, did-didn't you use to have a pair? They were really round, burgundy, and they made you look kind of umm...
Now, come on, come on, Steve. There must be something that you like about yourself.
Well, where is he? He is supposed to be here. What if the baby needs him?
Hi.
You WHAT? And I missed it? Because I was giving a makeover to that stupid hippie?
That's easy for you to say, you weren't almost just killed.
Dad, dad. We got it!! We Got It!!!
Uh-huh. Y'know what I was, I was thinking about?
Okay! I got the keys! Okay! Okay!
Wow that's uh, juicy. Umm, y'know what though Mon, I actually do have a lot of work to do so if-if-are you sure there's just not anything else?
Ya, know what Barr, I'm not gonna leave. I probably should, but I'm not, see 'cause I promised myself that I would make it through at least *one* of your weddings . See now, tonight, all I really wanted was to make it though this evening with a little bit of grace and dignity. Well , I guess we can all agree that's not gonna happen. There's nothing really left to say except.... "Her name was Lola. She was a showgirl. With yellow feathers , feathers in her hair, and a dress cut down to there. She would..."
Oh my god Chandler! If you can't handle this, what are you going to be like in the hospital? With the blood and the screaming and the little present that's shooting out of her!?
Well just ask Mona to give it back!
What was that?
Fine! I'm sorry for your loss!
Oh my God, what!?
Yes, and I know that you'd say no if he asked you, but I'm sorry; how great would you look walking down the aisle in this Donna Carin.
Not great.
I know. I know. I panicked, I panicked. I didn't want him to start yelling at me like I was some '74 Latour.
What? What!?! You kissed him?
Hi!
Ohh, okay, I'm sorry. You're right. Y'know what? We absolutely can stay married, because I was under the impression that the boxes were far away from each other. All right, look, just please, take a moment here and think about what you're asking of me.
Ok, you win.
Look at you, you are so big I can't believe it!
Well, I... you know, I-I-I don't know what to say... I mean, I never thought of you as a guy who needed his men to be men. You know, 'cause I gotta tell you Ross, it not like you just came in from branding cattle.
Joey? What's up?
Well, then can we meet him?
Oh! It's you. Hi.
To be nice.
Hey-whoa, slow down. No, keep moving. Wow!
I know.
Okay, I'll see you back at home, if I ever get a flight out of here.
Yes okay. Well now see this isn't telling us anything. Joe. Carlos. Peter. Ooh! Peter Luger! T hat's a steak house!
Yeah. Sure.
I do need you! I need you to stand near my head!
Okay, what's your name?
Go Monana! Well, you ladies are not the only ones living the dream. I get to go pour coffee for people I don't know. Don't wait up.
I don't care how long ago it was! You told people that I was half and half! Y'know what? I just want to point out I never did anything to hurt you in high school.
Sure. You got it. Great!
Guess what?! All that stuff about Nancy Branson being a slut was all a rumor so Chip dumped her and he wants to come over to my house tonight!
Yeah baby, I'll show you how we do it!
Oh, time's up.
Does it still hurt?
Alright! Enough out of you!
I cannot believe Ross is buying this!
She's perfect.
Hey! We're here!
You could.... say you're sorry to her mom.
Oh!
Y'know what else is really great about him, oh, what is the word for the adult that doesn't have dinosaur toys in their bedroom?
Hey, umm, can I ask you guys something?
Oh! I used to do that too!
Uh-huh. I know. It was just, it was just the perfect way to say goodbye.
Anymore!!
Good. You?
Yes!
I don't!
Yeah. Just to be sure I'm gonna call Dr. Wiener.
Oh my God! Oh my God! Thank you! That was the fire department, there was a fire at our place!
Joey, it's just a chair! What's the big deal?
And the chicken pooped in her lap. Oh, I'm so sorry. I just gave away the ending, didn't I? Oh! It's just, I just heard this story in the cab, and it is all I can think about.
Hey! Hey, cute jacket!
What?! You mean they're not coming to a social event where there's no men and there's no booze?! That's shocking! I don't care, as long as my mom's here.
This is easy...Can't do this! Oh! Wow! Seriously I can't do this.
Bye. Ahhh... So this is fun, huh?
Well, I guess I could take a couple days off work.
Phoebe, what are you doing?
Well, last time I almost got fired. You must end it, you must end it now!
Yeah. Y'know umm, uh, umm, about that, umm, Ross I really appreciate your offer to let me move in and everything, but don't you think it's gonna be weird?
Love to love ya baby! Ow! Love to love ya baby! Ow! Love to love ya, baby! Darnit! Ugh.
Yeah! I got my girls.
Both of you?
I know, I'm her!
No, everything's fine. I just gotta go back...
Okay, well that's now the third sign that I should not leave Emma.
Oh my God. Okay.
She climbs out of the frame, and then drags her half-a-body across the floor, just looking for legs to steal. And then with her one good hand, she slo-o-owly re-e-a-aches up and turns your doorknob.
Come on, I don't really want to be doing this right now. I am carrying a very heavy couch.
You're not the man who left the cell phone.
Who?
No!!
Hey!
Joey.
Hi! Oh my gosh!
My God! What happened to you?
This bench, it's hollow! I can't believe I never knew that! Oh, the presents!!!
Wow! What did he say?
Honey, what are you doing? That's too heavy.
Honey, come on, I have to be at work in like ten minutes Oh, all right, well it's not like I'm employee of the year or anything.
Oh God, I know I'm a pathetic loser.
In the afternoon. Mr. Zelner came into my office after lunch. He put them on my desk, and then I put a Post-It on it that said, "Must go out today." So you just keep looking in there! All right?
Man, don't be surprised if her hands and her feet get bigger too!
'Sup?
Nooo!
Hey, who's Phoebe with?
Oh, please, miss, you don't understand!
Really?! Even Ross?
Um... unless, unless I use yours.
Did he call? Did Mark call?
Oh yeah, now everybody wants to be under this hat!
Now wait a minute that's not fair. He was married to me a hell of a lot longer than he was married to Emily, he just didn't tell me. Maybe I have to pee again.
Really?
Oh, really, let me see, let me see.
Oh.
Oh, my, God, c'mon, you guys! He's gonna be home any minute! He's gonna kill me!
Okay, I'm not just waitressing. I'm.. I, um... I write the specials on the specials board, and, uh... and I, uh... I take the uh dead flowers out of the vase... Oh, and, um, sometimes Artelle lets me put the little chocolate blobbies on the cookies.
Who was that?
Because I think I just heard her moving around in there.
Okaaay. Any of you guys want anything else?
Nice! One and a half carat easy.
You were with Julie?
Well then Joey, what the hell were you doing with an engagement ring?!
Ooh... I love Barbados!
Come on, they were not that huge.
Oh, hey, Mona!
Well, Ross, we were worried about you. We didn't know how you were going to react.
Y'know who I always liked? Mork.
What are you doing?
Sorry. I'm so exited! I've been waiting for this for months! I got my hair coloured! I got new sheets! I'm making him a very fancy meal.
Good.
I mean we're not, we're not gonna live together anymore?
No, Phoebs. I'm dating Russ.
Oh! Y'know what? You're right! We meet, you flirted and then bamn nine years later you had me!
Ohh! That's great!
I'll do it.
All right! Y'know what? That's it! You wanna do it?! Let's do it!
It's not Christmas!
W-What are you, what are you talking about?
Arghh!!
Hey, Mr Philips, nice suit!
How about you guys?
Thank you. Thank you very much. Umm, I've known them separately and I've known them together and-and to know them as a couple is to know that you are truly in the presence of love. So I would like to raise my glass to Monica and Chandler and the beautiful adventure they are about to embark upon together. I can think of no two people better prepared for the journey.
Oh wait, Ross, would you just stay and help me get dressed?
You take that back.
Yeah, I'm just mad!
No, no-no-no. Phoebe, this was my fault and besides y'know what? I'm fine here.
That's great. So now, Super Gavin, when I come back where are you planning on flying off to?
Oh well, well thank you. Okay, stop. Stop looking at me like that. The last time that happened, that happened.
I... Well, I don't think they need any help.
Yeah. So don't move, okay? Just stay here and... maybe close your blinds at night.
Jurassic Park could happen.
Oh, I win! He's got Barney's on his speed dial.
Yeah.
Oh God, oh, and then she told the funniest story...
Ross!! Are you crazy?! I am still your wife!! What, were you just never gonna tell me?!! What the hell is wrong with you?!!!! Ugh, I could just kill you!!!!
Chandler Bing? It's time to see your thing.
Who...?
And now, y'know, I'm like... I'm like the other woman! I feel so..
But, it's not raining.
Well sure, if you say you're gonna take care of everything I have no reason to doubt you. Give me those forms! All right, now I'm gonna do this my way and I don't want to hear a peep out of you!
Who ? Joey: Me.
Oh.
I can not believe he would do that to Mon-Whoa! Joey, do they know that we know?
Mon, I'm so sorry.
No? So you're saying that if I called it, it wouldn't ring?
What?!
Excuse me. Hi.
Wow! It looks like the Easter Bunny's funeral in here.
Really? Mine too.
Yeah, yeah... It's... "climax your way to better skin".
Yeah.
Are you seein her again tonight?
Yes.
No. A break from us.
: Really? : Sure, we have scones left! : OK, read them to me.
I know.
Oh God. Ross, OK, if you care about me at all, you will get the pie out of the man's hood.
Oh-oh, Pottery Barn! You can throw the rest away.
Ohh, here you are. I was looking for you before. Joshua's gone so you and Emily are free to go.
Pheebs, I don't think anyone's mad about that.
Um-hmm, yeah.
How is you drinking helping the kids?
I don't want to say.
Thank you.
OK, you know what, are, are you being like, the blind date guy again?
Oh my God!
Are you serious?!
Whoa-ho.
Okay...
Of course you did Ross, you would date a gorilla if it called you Indiana Jones!
Closer than here?
Oh, that is so sweet!
Little village people.
Okay, y'know what? We don't need her measurements.
Well, I have a job interview at Ralph Lauren tomorrow!
What's Flimby's?
Whoa!! Whoa, whoa, wait a minute. What time did your little friend leave? Oh my God. She was there? She was still there? She was in there, when I was in there?!
Ok, careful.

You're right, I don't have to apologize. Sorry. Damnit!
Oh God... Oh, he's in there right now?
Oh, great.
Oh yeah? Okay.
Hi. Hey, hi! So uh, Frank and Alice wanted me to tell you that they're still outside making phone calls.
No, not yet.
Wow, you know what? That is the best fake speech I think I've ever heard.
Why?
Hey, what's-what's going on?!
Yeah. Ahh, here's a box of your stuff.
Okay, okay, okay should I be scared?
Nobody, forget it! Rachel: Maybe.
You heard them say that?
Maybe it's not as bad as I think. Y'know, maybe they didn't take it the way I meant it.
Phoebe, are you okay?
No Mon, you want to put them in concentric circles. I want to do this.
Okay, do you see, do you see what you're keeping me married too?!
Yeah! You know, ever since I had that dream about him, and can't get it out of my head! And what's the big deal, people do it all the time!
Oh! Well, um.. You've got plugs!
I know. Yeah, see, there's so much to do and I have so little time to do it in.
Jean-Claude she said yes, I'll see you tonight. Thank you.
Oh my God! That's Monica!!
Okay please tell me that this is just one of your jokes that you do that I don't get.
Hi, this is my friend Rachel.
I don't know! I mean, what brought that on?
Joey, just-just he-he's new in town and I know he doesn't have any guy friends. Just take him to like a ball game or something. I'll really appreciate it.
Do you still have that, um, Navy uniform?
You mean the mom you met in Montauk. She was a cat?!
Oh.. a little..
You said girl!
No, I was ten. I just developed early.
Ohhhhh. That's how it got fixed!
Joey, come on! It doesn't matter, you know, it's not like anything's gonna happen.
Oh wait! Y'know what? I can't, I can't look at it. I can't. Somebody else tell me, somebody tell me.
Ah that's great. No actually that's... That's great! That's really great! Y'know, I gotta tell ya writing, I mean writing, gets me uh, gets me kinda hot.
You and your stupid fear. I hate your fear. I would like to take you and your fear....
Uh-oh.
Excuse me?
Bathroom's up there.
That is not true. She did! She forced me!
Look Joey, I'm sorry if-if you thought that was mean, but I gotta tell ya something. That was not mean. Okay, my father is mean. He used to yell at me all the time on the boat, I mean it was horrible. I was just being a good teacher.
Have you ever seen so much crap?
Vanilla?!
Then, you will definitely get him back!
I can't believe that you yelled at my boss! I'm-I'm gonna lose my job! What am I going to do?!
Oh my God... What.. What are you guys doing here?
Yes! And not because I want you to go out with me, but because I don't want you to go out with anybody! Okay? I know it's a terrible thing to even think this, and it's completely inappropriate, but I want you to be at my constant beck and call 24 hours a day! I'm very sorry, but that is just the way that I feel.
Can I get you some water?
No. But I was showing him some cufflinks and I felt his pulse.
Nothing.
Oh my God!
Wha... the next one?
What? You just click when they click.
I just can't believe this! I mean, with the holidays coming up- I wanted him to meet my family-
What?
What?
Well, it was, and you would have seen it if you didn't showed up at ... 9:30?? God! Oh, this party was lame ...
All right, that's it, you guys! What happened out there?
Ugh!
: Loser?
Hi Tag! Hey, so did you have fun with uh, with Joey last night?
And you just get to be cool Aunt Phoebe!
Okay. Seriously, breathe louder Ross! That's great!
Ugh, Monica, I know about you and Chandler.
Hi. Thanks for the party, honey. Should I help you clean up?
I will think about it.
So, will you talk to him?
Okay. Okay. Joey, it's okay. Settle down.
So how is the uhm... baby styling business going?
We're having a girl?
You think you're gonna get out of this on a technicality?
Well of those things that you said in the interview, I mean if you believe any of them, I must not be a very good assistant. Y'know what? I am just gonna pack up my desk, and I will be gone by the end of the day! Well, I guess there's no use to me sticking around 'til the end of the day!
Oh.
Monica! I couldn't find him for two hours! He was having sex with Amy Welch!
Emmm. Now, instead of the vegetables, is there anyway I can substitute the three-pound lobster?
Me either. Umm, all right, first thing I need you to do is go downstairs and find a women named Hilda and tell her to go home.
Listen, y'know what? I was really freaked out too when I found out...
Well actually umm...
Wow! I can't, I can't feel my hands.
That's weird, she locked the door.
But y'know, I never really had anything to worry about. Ross was never very good at the flirting thing.
Shoot. Oh, I can't believe I did this!
Uh, I think I just did. And uh-oh, here it comes again. Shut up!
Well, because of us! Because of our history.
Eh, just a tad.
Okay Monica, did you know about this?!
Right.
Monica what?
Phoebe, come on, I don't wanna waste it! It would be like throwing away a hundred bucks!
Hmm.
Wow, Monica, I love that, you really have faith in me. Thank you. Technical question, how do you know when uh, the butter's done?
Oh wow! What now Ross you're not gonna talk? How on earth will you ever annoy me? Oh wait a minute, I know. I mean you'd think the damn jalepeno would've cleared up your sinuses, but no!! That's not enough... What are you doing?!
So, does this come in another color or...
You're right, I'm sorry. Thank you. Okay, that's what I'm gonna do.
Okay.
It just might be too hard, given the history and all that...
Anyway, um, I guess this belongs to you. And thank you for giving it to me.
Hey, thanks Ross, for taking care of all of this.
Y'know, all the women.
Yeah well it looks great!
I don't know! But maybe if we keep that drawer shut, it'll die.
Well, you have been in our lives for nearly two months now and we don't really know you. I mean, who is Julie? I mean, what do you like, what don't you like? We wanna hear everything.
Joey, what are you doing with the bag? You're audition is not until tomorrow.
Yeah!
I get to hire my own assistant!
Okay.
OK, well, bye.
That is not a tattoo, that is a nothing. I finally got her back in the chair, bairly touched her with a needle, she jumped up screaming, and that was it.
Well, now I don't have to.
Oh... Italy, I think.
Popular.
Yeah sure, iced tea would be great.
Phoebe!
A couple of bucks.
No.
What? What, do you mean you're not feeling well? What do you have? Is it Rubella? Because don't go near Emma, she has not had that shot.
Yeah. It was after the party, we were on the balcony and...
Well, it's a long story, but umm I broke Joey's chair...
Yeah, I-I-I-I'm funny Ben, but I'm not stupid. Okay?
Hi. Can Emma and I live here for a while?
Julie! Julie, isn't that great? I mean, isn't that just kick-you-in-the-crotch, spit-on-your-neck fantastic?
Oh, Phoebe, do I wanna hear this?
Y'know what? I am going to do something today. I'm not just gonna sit around like some old lady. I'm gonna get something pierced. Like my uh, like my nose or my tongue or something.
Okay, calm down, here they are.
Yeah, it is.
'Cause I don't need your stupid ship.
What? I'm not you. This may be the only wedding I ever have. I want it to be amazing.
Yes! Thank you! Exactly! You want it?
Chandler, you have just described virtually every man that we have ever gone out with.
Oh.
Awwww.
Look-look-look-look-look, my first pay check! Look at the window, there's my name! Hi, me!
Oh, that must be it.
Ohh, sorry.
Hi, it's me. I've been trying to reach you all night. I feel awful. Please, Ross, you gotta know there is nothing between me and Mark. This whole break-up thing is just stupid.
How do you know about that story?!
Hey! Great advice on that Joey thing!
I got the job!
Excuse me?
Hi...
Oh he's dusting me with a fossil brush. He thought it would be funny.
Hey!
Okay look, let me paint you a little picture. All right, you are settin' sail up the Hudson! You've got the wind in your h--arms! You-you get all that peace and quiet that you've always wanted! You get back to nature! You can go fishin'! You can-ooh, you can get one of those little hats and have people call you captain, and then when you're old, Cappy.
Then what's that big lump under your covers?
What?
Why? Seriously I did not understand a word that you said.
Ohh! Phoebe, this is all your fault! Now he loves her, he's gonna marry her, and this is all your fault.
Look he doesn't have any brothers or sisters, somebody's gonna have to teach him this stuff! And I haven't taught him anything that a normal 6-year-old doesn't know anyway!
Okay. . Hello Drake, I'm surprised to see you here.
Monica?!
Yeah!
Well what is it? Let me see.
So, if I wanna have my kid when I'm 35, I don't have to get pregnant until I'm 34. Which gives Prada four years to start making maternity clothes! Oh wait, but I do want to be married for a year before I get pregnant...
There isn't. There is totally isn't.
Oh! That's why. I'm sorry!
Yeah, Monica's settin' me up.
Yeah, this is Tag. Tag, this is Phoebe. Phoebe, can I see you for a second?
Ohh, it's Joshua invited me to this fancy club opening tonight. But, I already told Mr. Waltham that I would take his niece to this dumb old opera. So... What are you gonna do?
I can't, I gotta go.
Okay. Uhh, Ross, y'know what, there's something that I-that I have to talk to you about and everybody's saying that I shouldn't tell you, but I think they're wrong. I mean, and you know how people can be wrong.
My gynecologist tried to kill me.
Well they have uh, some unusual pet names for each other. Including umm, evil bitch and uh, sick bastard. Oh God oh! Contraction!
Well...
Score.
Ok! Can't believe I'm risking this again, but you're on! All right Joe, you remember the rules! Heads I win, tails you lose.
Wow! I don't know if I could ever do that. I always figured the first time I had a baby was with somebody I love and that baby would be a...keeper.
Well, what happened?
Hey!
Oh, you got me.
Ooy.
Okay, you know what? I don't have it, but I can tell you exactly where it is on my night stand, and...okay. But you know what? I have my drivers license and I have a twenty.
No! God, would you just calm down!
What?
Oh God, oh God, oh God oh God oh God oh God....
Oh god what am I gonna do you guys, I can't even comfort my own baby! I'm the worst mother ever!
Oh, gosh, it's hot in here.
Oh-ho, my God! That was so awesome! You totally got him back for calling you fat! He was just drooling all over you. That must've felt so great!
So Mon, when are we gonna meet this new secret waiter man?
Great set tonight Phoebs.
I mean it's the end of an era!
You don't have any secrets!
I want the little round waffles.
Oh, no, no, no. Presents first. Food later.
All right fine! You're not invited to the party we're gonna have either.
And um, what-what is that Ross?
Okay... Hey listen, just before you go I-I again, I just wanna say "thank you" for coming with me.
Yes, I did. Thank you very much, it was excellent.
Oh my God you stole her award!
Yeah! Y'know, ever since I ran out on Barry at the wedding, I have wondered whether I made the right choice. And now I know.
I know. Ross still sees his pediatrician!!! I don't care!
Heyyyyy! Contraceptives are not always effective! Right?
Come on Phoebe! Don't be such a goodie-goodie!
So if you think I didn't say goodbye to you because you don't mean as much to me as everybody else, you're wrong. It's because you mean more to me.
Monica, please?
Well then honey, buy the lamp! Hey, we have that 60 bucks from Ross.
If I said I was, would you judge me?
Stop it! I will kill you. I hate the fact that my room is so small.
You bought boobs?
I'll get her.
Well, I never thought I'd say this, but I'm gonna go use Ugly Naked Guy's bathroom.
A-ha!
Okay, y'know what? Can I, can I talk now?
Okay?
Yes of course, absolutely! You're right. I'm sorry.
Look at that!
No I know, because to be a grandmother you have to be married and have children and I don't have any of those things. That's why it's so funny.
Bye.
What?
Well yeah, I wish that you would. Well, no it's not in there! How about that drawer?
You know, he was just doing his job...
Pheebs, I... there isn't gonna be any flying about! We actually thought we were a little too mature for stuff like that.
Yeah.
I'll be right there! Okay, Ross, please come on! I thought we have moved on! I thought we've gotten to a place where we could be happy for each other! I mean was that just me?
Oh please. That Paolo thing was barely a relationship. All it really was was just, ya know, meaningless animal sex. Ok, ya know, that sounded soooo much better in my head.
No, we didn't get married! That's ridiculous!
Well not when they find out you slept with Jason Hurley an hour after he broke up with Monica.
Did I say I was done guessing? Okay, thank you for that. Oh wow! What's this?
That's right!
C'mon up.
Oh well...
Oww!
HEY!! Do you have to do that? It's Saturday!
I know. I'm sorry.
Agh, it was the graduation from hell.
Right, I'll see you guys later...
Oh, it was great. Mark is so sweet.
Monica? You gonna be very proud of me. I just got us dates with two unbelievably cute nurses.
Oh, it is so unfair. It's like that time they promoted Sandra over me at work.
Ooh great! Very Monica.
Kim, hi.
Oh, well okay. Well, there you go.
Ross?
Foot rubs for a month!
Oh, please, Monica. You've always hated my lamp, and then, all of a sudden, it's just magically broken?
No!! You are getting married! This is all I have.
No!
What?
All right I know, I know how it looks Pheebs, but I'm telling you...
Yeah I know! I miss that.
Yeah!
I know, but it's just it's the first time, and I just don't want her to think that because I didn't marry Barry, that my life is total crap, you know?
C'mon Daddy, listen to me! All of my life, everyone has always told me, 'You're a shoe! You're a shoe, you're a shoe, you're a shoe!'. And today I just stopped and I said, 'What if I don't wanna be a shoe? What if I wanna be a- a purse, y'know? Or a- or a hat! No, I don't want you to buy me a hat, I'm saying that I am a ha- It's a metaphor, Daddy!
So don't do it.
So, I still have boxes here. I still have boxes at Ross's, and I have nowhere to live! Wow. I could so easily freak out right now.
Fine.
Thank you.
Eww!
What?!
Yes it is! It is true! I went, I went after Ross in stupid London.
I love you too.
You get your messages!
Okay. Okay. Okay. Joey, I have got to tell you something!
Yeah?
Yeah, what did happen?
And there's a peach cobbler warming in the oven so the plate's gonna be hot but that shouldn't be a problem for you.
Yeah, ohh! Why, damnit, why did I open my mouth? I have a crush on you; I am attracted to you. Gee, I-I know that I freaked him out
Sorry-
Oh...
What? C'mon you guys, I don't care, I have a date tonight.
Why?! What is it?
I mean, it's a cat, y'know, it's a cat. Why can't they get one of those bugs, y'know, one of those fruitflies, those things that live for like a day or something? What're they called, what're they called, what're they called?
Pheebs, this whole apartment thing is just a nightmare! Every place I can afford comes with a roommate who is a freak. I mean, look at this; "Wanted. Female roommate, non-smoker, non-ugly." It's just, there is nothing! The city's full!
Well and clearly not a minute sooner.
What?!
Um look I was thinking.. If its ok with Monica I would like to invite Amy to Thanksgiving.
Yeah! All right, I'll see you guys later.
Well, not this second!
Sorry!! I just feel bad about all that sleep you're gonna miss wishing you were with me!
Monica, nothing has even happened yet, and you're already so...
Oh, well, I...It's kind of weird talking to you about this, but...
Really? But I'm being so unreasonable.
Okay.
No, we kinda broke up instead.
Ok, while you "mmm" on it for awhile, I'm gonna go find a place for my new lamp.
No!! No! He's not married, or involved, with anyone!
Yeah! Can you believe that something that stupid actually got us our apartment back?
I know. I know, but y'know condoms only work like 97% of the time.
You think about stuff like that?
All right listen ball boys! My grandmother had one of these when I was a little girl and it was the sweetest thing! I mean it was so cute, it would sit in my lap and purr all day long, and I would drag a shoestring on the ground and he would chase it!
See? Why, Gavin, why? Right when I'm about to change my opinion of you, you go and you ... and you do that ...
Ohh! Oh God!
Okay, that we may be able to do.
Phoebe! It's 6 o'clock in the morning! Why aren't you at Gary's?
Oh. Oh, it's beautiful. I see it now.
Well, y'know it's just been so long since I've been to Chuckie Cheese.
Well of course that is what I'm here for!
Can I talk to you alone for a minute?
Well look who's here!
Oh, please, you wanted to get caught.
She is?
You know, Ross, just keep making your jokes. How are you gonna feel if we actually do win?
Can somebody please go in?
Hi! You're back from your date!
No, no, no, I'm looking at a purchase order right here and it clearly states that we ordered the Rivera bikini in a variety of sizes and colours. And.... What does it matter, what I'm wearing?! Can I please speak to your supervisor? Thank you. We're holding.
Oh!
Oh, why do you even bother? I already ruined her first birthday... And do you know how important these early experiences are Ross? Very! According to the back cover of that book that you gave me.
Yeah uh, y'know what uh, let's skip it.
I know, I lied! I didn't want her to think I was a terrible mother! I can't even see my own baby!
Ugh.
Don't touch my coat!
Hi... I'm on a date...
No! Not at all!
Drums?
Hey.
Joey! Joey!
Seriously Pheebs, it's not gonna be that kind of a party.
Oh yeah, what department was that? The Jerk department?
No Ross! Ross! Ross! My child has no father!
Oh.
Hi!
I will not! I'm the divisional head of men's sportswear!
Oh no, you're the best.
What?!
None.
Yeah, you got like 14 hours until she has to be at the airport, and you're sitting here in the hallway with a 28-year-old cheerleader with a fat lip.
Oh that's okay.
Oh my God, it's so huge, but you just have to promise me that you cannot tell anyone.
AAAHHHH!
So umm, what time are you supposed to leave?
Really?! You think so? Y'know, I had just rolled out of bed.
Phoebe and I saw Chandler with a blonde woman today outside on the street and then we followed them to a house in Westchester.
How much longer?
Yeah, yeah and you know what, I know she's gonna wanna run again, I just don't know how to get out of it, I mean, I live with her.
What?
What?
Oh, that is so...
...hormones, yeah.
Ohh, and the nicest girlfriend!
Hi!
Ohhhh. Honey, honey, honey, it's okay, it's okay honey. I'm gonna fix you a drink, huh? Maybe a margarita?
No, I-I-I-I don't, I actually don't know who I'm talking about! So!
Oh, thank you...
Yeah?
Oh, ok, thank you. Do you see what all the guys see in her?
Well, I-I know you can do that too. I'm just, I'm just saying if you need somebody to talk to... Hi!
Excuse me?
No, Monica! Monica! We have to fix this!
Uh, yeah, if you want too.
Okay. Okay. I think we can do this if we just get organized. All right? We have two days to plan this party. We just need to make fast decisions! Okay? All right, where are we gonna have it?
Oh. Huh. You know, it is weird that Phoebe would set me up on a date that was awful on the same night that Joey set you up on a date that didn't even show.
Yeah.
She's right.
So did you read your evaluation yet?
Well, why don't you talk to me about it, maybe I can help.
I can't believe you don't want to know. I mean, I couldn't not know, I mean, if, if the doctor knows, and Carol knows, and Susan knows....
Oh, if she jumps, I get her tickets.
Oh well, it's kinda lonely up there, so I just thought I would come out here and get some fresh air.
Why? I love that thing.
No. Yeah, and I know that. All right, well thank you so much for coming in it was nice to meet you.
Oh, Sophie, I guess you didn't hear about Joanna...
What?
Uh.
Well, here's another question for ya. Uhh, do you know what that silver knob on the toilet does?
Thank you Joey. You know what? I'm not even sure I can have caffeine.
I didn't know you could get married here.
Hi.
Okay.
Okay, see now, what I just heard, blah-blah-blah, blah-blah-blah-blah-blah, blah-blah-blah, blah, blah.
Credit.
Ah, oh God. Oh, honey, oh that's OK.
I don't know.
Ooh, this is soo sweet, Joey our little twinkle-toes.
Fine! We went out.
This place is amazing.
I know! I know, she says it's all mass-produced, nothing is authentic, and everyone winds up having the same stuff. So come on, she's gonna be here any second! Can we please just cover this up with something?! Please?
I know. And Mom, I realize you and Daddy were upset when I didn't marry Barry and get the big house in the suburbs with all the security and everything, but this is just so much better for me, you know?
Oh my God!!
Oh, good, good! We had this idea to make a birthday video for Emma and we'll give it to her when she is 18.
I'm sorry?
I know I had it this morning, and I know I had it when I was in the kitchen with...
It's Robert Bobby.
Then you're not gonna like what's coming. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Thank you, thank you.
No, what?
Ross, she still has not noticed that the baby's sock is on the ground.
Wiper blades. I don't even have a car.
Yeah, because I was mad at you, not because I stopped loving you!
See, I don't know, for me it would have to Chantal.
Aw what are you?! A detective?
Remember that big thing I was gonna tell you about?
Surprise!!
To get you to make out with him!!!
Oh God. You did. You heard. Ok, listen, let me explain.
No! No! It's just that all the people in the entire world that I want to talk to are right here.
Shall we?
Oh, everything's pink.
Yeah, okay, at ease solider!
Yes! Totally!
No you really think that's what it is?
Well, I think you're forgetting the kinkiest former resident of that room.
Funny book?
Of course, of course.
I know.
Hey Joey, how'd the audition go?
Well, maybe sometimes I find out things or I hear something and I pass that information on y'know kinda like a public service, it doesn't mean I'm a gossip. I mean, would you call Ted Kopel a gossip?
So umm, what time are you supposed to leave?
What?
See your twenty-five...and...uh, Monica, get my purse.
Okay Monica, what are you doing? You're gonna lose your job! This is not you!
Are you okay Mon?
Oh, you poor little famous man.
So, uhm... what are you gonna do today?
All right, y'know what? I-I'm sorry. I will try to tone it down and uh stop yelling.
I was sending you signals?
Okay, my turn!!
Hello. Umm, when is your next flight to London?
Hey.
So what are you saying; I should run him under hot water and bang his head against a table?
Am I the only one who doesn't think that she's hot? Ross?
And yet she was worth jeopardising our relationship!!
Wow! I did not see that coming.
Because, I can't! Ross, I told you, no. I can't.
All right, all right, all right. Last night, I had a dream that, uh, you and I, were...
I know!
Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks!
There's been a teeny-teeny change in plans. It turns out that I'm not free tonight. So...
Well relax, he'll be here.
No! No! Phoebe, come on! I don't want to switch! Please come on! I can throw wet paper towels here!
Um, hum.
Not even with your best friend.
I'm thinkin' no.
All right, who's turn is it to help me get up!
Oh hi.
Yeah, when I was in the bathroom I saw the window that I crawled out of at my wedding, and God, I just started thinking that I shouldn't be here, you know I shouldn't, people are going to be looking at me and judging me and, and thinking about the last time.
Oh, I am so sorry.
Ok, great, because I gotta get out of here, the smell of beets is killing me!
Probably just the first half.
Oh no, no, I'll be there too.
What? Oh y'know what? Can we please keep the chicken and the turkey and everything on the other side of the table? The smell is just yuck!
Ross kissed me.
No! Seriously! What's wrong with you?!
Well, it wasn't just me, alright? He freaked out too! He couldn't even undo my bra!
Okay, umm, I'm gonna get my sweater.
Oh, could somebody give me a hand with this zipper?
Dear losers, do you really think I'd hide presents under the couch? P.S. Chandler, I knew they'd break you.
Yeah... ....OK. Where were we? Oh, OK... five card draw, uh... jacks or better... nothing wild, everybody ante.
Oh, yeah. And uh, the best part though, when the uh, waiter spilled water down my back, I jumped up, and my boob popped out.
You are having a party tonight??
I've never wanted you more.
Ohh!!
So it would just be, me alone?
And so I had a lot of work to do so Ross, nice guy that he is, offered to help me out. And then we had a little wine, we got to talking, and the next thing you know out of nowhere Ross comes on to me.
I mean, it-it was like, it was like he made us into a team.
Oh, that's funny!
Okay well Ross! Stop it please! Wait a minute!
Oh, no no no no no.
Well-well that's 'cause I went down there and they were all smoking. This is actually the smell of success.
Hi!
Phoebe, you're on.
Well I...
Hey!
Any luck?
Nice to meet you.
Yeah-but come on-Listen, I'm sorry I don't want to make you uncomfortable, but I told Phoebe that it happened and she doesn't believe me.
Can't I just look at the handles on them?
No!
I don't know. I know I don't work late tomorrow night.
Ok, let's keep talking.
Okay. 'Cause this is where I wanna be, okay? No more messing around. I don't wanna mess this up again.
Y'know I don't, I don't understand guys, I mean I-I would never congratulate Monica on a great stew by y'know, grabbin' her boob.
Okay, stop what you're doing, I need envelope stuffers, I need stamp lickers.....
Hi. What are you doing here? Isn't this against the rules?
God. I forgot how much I love driving. I have got to get my license renewed.
I just can't believe this is happening. I mean, when I was little, everybody's parents were getting divorced. I just figured as a grownup I wouldn't have to worry about this.
No, it wasn't. It was actually the...
What? C'mon, talk to me.
See, there's always one guy. "If I had a wish, I'd wish for three more wishes."
"Dear Rach, you're a great person. Sorry about your tiney-wienie."
Ross? Look, whatever this relationship stuff that Emily wants, just give it to her. Come on, the bottom line here is that you love her. So just fix whatever she wants fixed. Just do it. I mean, you're gonna have to try. You'll just gonna hate yourself if you don't. Oh come on answer it! It's driving me crazy!
Ah, did I leave the stove on?
Oh my God! Joey!
You put holes in my baby's ears!
Mon. I wish I could, but I've made plans to walk around.
Okay. Umm, what should we do for the theme?
Ow. Ow. Ow.
Please, what about you and Chandler?
Hey! You remembered to put clothes on this morning.
Hi! Happy Thanksgiving!
Okay. So these signals Ross, explain this to me, 'cause maybe I need to be more careful. I mean, am I sending you these signals right now?
Honey, I'm sorry, but he's right. I love you, but you're crazy.
Well, I-I could live without it.
Uh-huh!
Yeah, I know. I had the greatest day though, I got to sit in on the meeting with the reps from Calvin Klien. I told my boss I liked this line of lingerie, she ordered a ton of it. How was your day?
Mm-hmm.
Y'guys ever heard the story about when Rosses mom went to the beauty salon?
Well in High School, that added up to head cheerleader.
Ugh!
What, what, wait a minute! You haven't even told her you were a doctor, yet? How long have you known her, likean hour?
Well, at least that's a great suit.
It was ... oh my god. He didn't have a last name. It was just "Tag". You know, like Cher, or, you know, Moses.
So, what, you're just, you're just okay with being flaky?
Oh Ross, come on! This is not, this is not a marriage!! This is the world's worst hangover! Ross, listen, if you do not get this annulment, I will!
Really!?
We're paying for this y'know.
Ohhh, this is the least jealous I've ever been!
Oh. Oh yeah, don't get to worked up over it. I mean it-it sounds like he's a doctor, but he's not.
Oh God.
Right?
And hey! Just so you know, it's not that common! It doesn't happen to every guy! And it is a big deal!!
With my alignment. I've got one leg shorter than the other.
Oh, this one's for me!
You guys, I'm telling you, when she runs, she looks like a cross between Kermit The Frog and The Six Million Dollar Man.
Come on!
Oh. Oh, right.
You know honey, there is a thin line between love and hate, and it turns out that line...is a scarf!
Chandler, what are you doing? There is a trash can right there.
Excuse me! You didn't tell him, did you?
Horny bitch. No! You're a horny bitch! Noooo! You're the horny bitch! No! You're a horny bitch!
Oh! Weather bitch!
Open your drapes! Open your drapes!
It's OK, it's fine.
Hello?! I still don't know what the hell I'm doing!
Is Ross here?
Oh my God!! Do it!! Honey, you've waited long enough!!
I mean, this is unbelievable.
Exactly!
Wow, this is so cool, you guys. The entire city is blacked out!
Ross, there is no pressure on you. Okay? I mean you can as involved as you want.
No! They didn't even talk to each other. God, how was I supposed to know they were having problems?
Phoebe, isn't Jethro Tull a band?
Uh-huh.
All right!! Fine! Fine.
You have a son!
Okay, y'know maybe I should come back...
Phoebe!
Well, I don't get it, but she wanted me to give you her phone number.
Are you kidding me?
I won't boss you around.
Okay, I'm just gonna write this out to cash.
I don't get this! She was horrible!
The earring? No. But look, I found my sunglasses under the couch! I've been looking for these since like last summer.
Ross, would you just stop it! It's getting really old.
Wait, what do you mean you're getting a new brain?
Yes. Here you go Officer uh, Handsome.
Oh my God! Oh, that's funny, I can't believe I did that.
We'll be right back sir.
Well, okay. Would-would you get me a Diet Coke?
My father had an heart attack... ...while I was at Barney's.
Well, I was gonna let you play with it.
You have not worn that T-shirt since you were 15!! It doesn't even fit you anymore!
All right, look, we did not know that you wanted a stripper so we went to the phonebook and we got the first name we could find!
All right! Let's get this over with! Ugh! Ohhh! No! Look what I did! Oh, I mean, look at this mess! I mean, we're probably gonna have to clean this up! Y'know? We're gonna have to reschedule!
No-no, but I support it.
Monica, you broke up with him for a reason.
Shh.. Go back to sleep. I have to go home.
Bye!
He plays for the Yankees. Seriously, ESPN! Just once and a while, have it on in the background. Ooh, this one was Pierce Brosnan!
Oh Ross you're so tense! You just gotta relax okay? Just need to relax all right? Just need to relax...
I've never given her a cookie. Have you?
It's not a miracle Joey! I'm sure there's some explanation.
So maybe something in an office.
Hey.
What's your favourite thing about summertime?
Yeah but, I've never asked a guy out before.
I bet you're a Gemini.
Oh yeah. I used to babysit him. Hey, how's his dad?
See? Yeah, you told me the story. He and Monica dated when they broke up they couldn't even be in the same room together and you all promised that you would stay his friend and what happened? He got phased out!
Okay. All right, stand up. Well, when we're at the door, I lightly press my lips against his, and then move into his body just for a second, and then I make this sound, "Hmmm." Okay, I know it doesn't sound like anything, but I swear it works.
Oh please. Okay, anyone in this room think that I would send Ross begging symbols, please show of hands.
Yeah, and-and you better make sure he tips you this time.
Hey Chandler. Monica just broke my seashell lamp.
Wow! I can't believe you lied to me.
I am not gonna answer that!
You do?
Yeah, they were very y'know...wrestley. But, I guess that's normal?
I thought this might happen today. Ross, I know the holidays can be rough. Y'know? And it's probably really hard for you to be alone right now.
I got a really incredible job offer.
Yeah.
I just wanted to let you know I've changed my mind: I'm gonna do it, I'm gonna kiss Joey.
Okay, okay, okay, I got one! Anyway- The valentine Tommy Rollerson left in your locker was really from me.
I know! What?!
Monica, what should I do?
Yeah right.
I knew that! I knew that! I was just messin' with you too!
Well, what-what 'cha got there?
Time's up, now your dead.
I mean he just started going out with her.
I'm having dinner with my dad tomorrow night, do you wanna come?
I don't know! I'm-I'm kinda thinking it-it was the lobster...
Oh, was it awful?
What? Did her ass explode?!
What's goin' on?
This one's from Joey... feels like a book. Thinks it's a book... feels like a book. And... ...it's a book!
What? Shut up! We're winning!
Oh, wait Ross! I'm sorry, one more thing!
What?!
Well... Umm, I got TiVo.
Oh good you're still here!
Well, I assume I'll have to take showers with him, but y'know, that's true of any job.
No, I'm sorry, we're all out of those. Anybody else?
Y'know Bob in Human Resources...
OH! And the year before that, when you set up that nighttime tour of that button factory?
Ohh, God, I just got so nervous that he would say no.
Really? What's that like?
I know.
Hi.
Well this is romantic!
Me too.
Thank you Phoebe.
Yes! I'd love to! Have her come by the office.
I promise.
What? Wait! Why...why do you get the story?
Hey, Mon, if you were hoping to sleep with Joshua the first time tonight, which one of these would you want to be wearing.
I'm gonna miss you so much.
Hi!
Dealer takes two. What do you bet?
Aghh.
Good, Pheebs. What'd you buy?
Hm-mmm.
No. Ross, it, it just seems that y'know it's time we-we y'know, move on. I mean, I mean don't' you think?
Okay.
Aww.
No it's okay, this is what's gonna happen. I'm gonna wait a couple years and then the baby will tell him.
Hey! Ross, listen can you come to a charity event tonight?
No, you have it, really, I don't want it-
Okay, who's next?!
Yeah!
You did!
Really? Oh thank you! Oh... Oh, would it be completely inappropriate to give you a hug?
Ohh, with who?
Ross! I just had a conversation with her, and she said that she and Joey made a deal!
Yeah, I'm not talking about her...
Phoebe, I thought your dad was in prison.
Ha, tails!
Yeah, yeah. Phoebe and I are going to have so much fun. And thank you for watching the baby, by the way.
True story.
Oh y'know what honey? Let's not talk about that right now?
Oh wow!
Ross, tonight was about the two of you getting along. Oh, would you just see my chiropractor, already.
Well, who wouldn't?!
Now Joey, what did the duck do?!
Yeah I know-I'm good-I got it! Now wait a minute, I've got one more thing I have to say to you...oh right! Shut up!
Oh, but look how straight those noodles are!
Well, I-I-I've been on Standby for a flight home for hours.
In case you didn't notice, that is a scary man.
No, y'know what? Maybe somebody came in here and fixed it! Or something!
Ohh! My God! Barry!!
Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me, excuse me, sorry. Hi.
Oh my God!! You guys have such problems!! I feel so terrible for you!
Oh!
I'm sorry daddy.
Ugh. Excuse me, could you give this to that guy over there? Go ahead. Thank you. Sorry. Okay, Las Vegas.
OK, OK. So, you ever get a pet with a girlfriend?
Hey. Oh, poor Pheebs.
What?
Well, how can you be a tour guide, don't you have to be a dinosaur expert or something?
Did, did he just, did he, did he just say, he said bye. He said bye. You said, you said bye to me. You said bye to me.
Yeah.
But I do not want to have everything decided for me. I spent my whole life like that. It's what I had with Barry, that was one of the reasons I left. I, I like not knowing right now and I'm sorry if that scares you but if you want to be with me you are gonna have to deal with that.
Oh god, waddawe do, waddawe do, waddawe do?
Well, what do you mean?
I know. You know, we're just gonna have to figure out a plan tonight. Can you please just take care of her for today?
Well, you're the one who wants to fire him, so you're gonna have to do it.
Wait, I'm not just gonna drink somebody's old coffee.
Phoebe, hi, we're so sorry. You're totally right. We are here one hundred per cent and we love you and we are ready to start your birthday celebration.
Yeah, four times.
What?!
Oh, Joey, look who it is.
Look, this is not that big of a deal! You just don't date Ross! There's a million other guys out there, you just...
Yeah well, you know what, so is uh, Sorentino's.
Oh well then, so I'm just going to go back to talking to my friend here. And you can go back to enjoying your little hamburger.
Well, he's coming from Jersey, he said he would get here as fast as he could!
Come on you gotta have one!
You don't know anything.
So Pheebs, what do you want for your birthday?
Oh, I can't believe I ever let him touch me with those fingers.
Bzzzz.... I love you, Ross.
Phoebe, how would you do this to me? This was all your idea.
Uh well, uh this is a silent auction. They lay out all the stuff here and then you write down your offer and then the highest bid gets it.
Oh God. Oh I can't believe Joey Tribbiani heard me throw up!
When did this happen?
Well, I-I'm startin' too.
Hi! Oh, how was your date last night?
Really?
Oh my God! That's my boss. You have to seat us somewhere else.
Yes.
Yes.
Ok Ross, just so you know, calling it a poopie diaper doesn't make this process any cuter.
You don't tell a guy that you're looking for a serious relationship! You don't tell the guy that! Now you scared him away!
No! Don't say that! Don't say that!
I can't believe I don't get to go to my own prom, this is so harsh.
I'm not asking you to go on a date with him!
You're kidding.
Ok...
Ross, you don't seem okay.
Yeah?
Ahh, yes, I will have a glass of the Merlot and uh, he will have a white wine spritzer. Woo! Hey, look at that, the airport's moving. Hey, are we moving?! Are we moving? Why are we moving? Hey, time-out, umm, yeah, does the captain know that we're moving? Oh my God. Oh, my gosh.
Ha!
Oh, Monica. You are not still going over that thing.
Alright, enough, enough, come on. Let's just all go in at the same time.
Hello.
What is the emergency?!
Oh, c'mon, Luisa!
When the Louis Vuitton people found out that Ralph Lauren wanted me back, the offered me more money! Isn't that great?
Ohh, it's gonna be so great! I'm gonna get to help decide what we sell, I'm gonna have an office with walls and everything. I'm gonna have walls!
Well, I feel fine, but I think you're bumming out the rest of the kids.
Ross-Ross, you have no idea what this means to me! I mean, I mean I was gonna be homeless. You just saved me! You're my hero!
Hormones!
What are you shushing?
Really?
No, he said we were holding up the people behind us.
Oh, I found him. He was Paolo's cat.
All right honey, we'd better go if we wanna catch that movie.
Coming.
No! Joey, oh you're so sweet. You're so-so sweet, honey. But I'm not, I'm not looking for a husband.
Yeah!
Surprised?
Um, Mon, Chandler's not here.
Well, screw charity work. What've you got?
We're waiting for you to open the door. You got the keys.
Agh, what a jerk. I kept talking about you and he kept asking me out. I mean, naturally, you know, I said no.
What? Oh, I'm sorry, I can't, I'm busy.
Joey, Joey I love you so much, but I...
It's all gonna be okay. They're just so happy that I'm not suing them that they gave me one extra month paid maternity leave. So long as I understand that the money should not construed as a down payment on this or any other child I should bear.
Okay!
"Well, should we just continue to live together and not really tell each other how we're really feeling?"
Monica! Look! Hi! What do ya think?
Hey, c'mon, cut it out.
Well, can't you tell her that you are not in the mood?
Hey! Hey, you guys, I finished the crossword all by myself! Hug me!
What? What are you talking about?! You-you're the one who's been telling me to get over Ross and move on. I'm moving on, and you're moving on with me. Come on, give me one good reason why you don't wanna go.
Just one drink?!
Oh, I'm sorry what?
I'm off my break now so uh, um here you take this and um, I am gonna go pour these very nice people some coffee. Ok. Oh look at that, I don't have a pot. I don't have a pot. Well, hey, maybe I've got one at home, or in Scarsdale. Hey is that a door?
Oh, d'you like it?
Op, op, car! Car!! Ugh!!!
Ooh!
Umm, hi!
What?!
So what should we do? Should we start looking for a new place?
I-I-I of course, I have more responsibilities than that.
Well, y'know he lost his keys so he was looking for them...
You all know? Does Ross know?
Oh wow.
Yeah?
Aw honey stop! It's not that bad.
Aw, thanks!
Wha.. well, Ella's a nice name!
Oh, Phoebe, that really cute guy is here again.
Rachel Green's office!! Give me that phone! Hello, this is Rachel Green, how can I help you? Uh huh ... ok then ... I'll pass you back to your son.
So that there will be a decent place for me to sit.
Right!
Who's Gladys?
Well, y'know, if-if kids like to play with Capri pants.
Ooh, your brother. Score!
Pheebs, this guy has been obsessed with your sister, for God knows how long, okay, you don't just give up something like that.
Right...
I'm not gonna marry Chandler!
Hey!
Okay.
Morning!
Hey, I was doin' great before I found out about you. You think it's easy for me to see you with Julie?
Ok. So now, I think Emma is probably down for the night, but if you need anything Ross . . .
Phoebe!!
That's great!
Hi.
Right! But, none of that compared to how kind and-and how gentle and thoughtful he is.
Oh really?! Then how come all your stuff is in this box?!
Where ya going?
But Ross, you want the name Ruth!
Noo.
Oh my God!
All right, who would uh, like some yams? Will?
Who gave you that hickey?
All right!
I want to tell you to have a good honeymoon!
Okay.
See? Now, he could date her.
Yes, I've done my studying and I really know my stuff.
Ooh, it was only okay.
Because they're people.
Oh my god, this is the worst date ever!
Oh.
Ooh, so cute, that I'm thinking about jamming this pen in my eye.
Well, Ross said my name.
Well, I do, but you're just gonna have to actually look at this as more of an investment than a cat.
Oh Joey, I'm so happy things worked out for us that we're having this baby together. I love you so much.
Ross, what's the matter?
Seriously, it's moving!
No...
Oh yeah.
You're supposed to realize that they are adults! And that they can make their own decisions.
Ooh... oooh... oh, ah... Can I ask you a question?
This is just occurring to you?
Well, well, well, look what mommy found!!
Joey! Why did we have to rush out of there so fast?!
Oh, wow, Molly is just great!
Oh Mon, listen I have to ask! Okay, Joey Tribbiani invited me back to his apartment, now does he do this with a lot of girls?
Okay.
You really, really need to get some sleep, honey.
Yeah.
What? What is so strange about me having a date?
Oh! Screw it, I didn't get it!
All right, Julie.
Ohh! Ew!
Oh, look at her, so happy!
Okay, so let's play for some pepper! Stop spending my money!
Hey look-look, Phoebe's talking to uh, Cute Coffeehouse Guy.
Well, what's he like?!
Yeah.
Who is it?
Oh, well, it's complicated. I don't actually have a boyfriend. But um. . .
Yeah!!! Kill 'um!!!
Relax! It's not like it's Citizen Kane!
Anybody! You, me, you know, Monica's mom...
Yes! And please tell her to bring a cake!
But, they're across the hall! I mean that's two doors away, it would take them a long time to peck their way back over here.
A big idiot.
Well, for your information, Paolo is gonna be in Rome this New Year, so I'll be just as pathetic as the rest of you.
How can you not remember us kissing?!
What's that?
What?!
What are you talking about?!
Oh no! No! It's actually-it's very sweet. It's very sweet. Look! Yeah, do you want it?
I don't know, I don't know, weren't you the guy that told me to quit my job when I had absolutely nothing else to do. Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!!
N-it wasn't easy, but it's your birthday and I did what I got to do.
I'm in.
Oh! Hey, Mr. Treeger.
Yeah well unless we tell him.
That would be great!
Wh-Hey, I just gave you peeing on a stick.
Okay!
Did you tell the doctor you did it jumping up and down on your bed?
Well, they always called.
And Monica, what are you going to make?
You mean the one that you're wearing?
Well, it is, all right? When we were out there today, all I kept thinking was: I can't believe Chandler is screwing this woman, but MAN this would be a nice place to live!
Oh, oh, that's what you're talking about. Hey.
Oh God!
That's right!
I'm on the phone! Dr. Wiener?
Noo! Maybe! I, I don't know. Ross, I still can't forgive you for what you did, I can't, I just, but sometimes when I'm with you I just, I feel so...
Oh Emma. This is going to be your first Thanksgiving. What are you thankful for? Mommy's bobbies.
Joey! You never gonna believe it: she called.
On TV?! Yeah!
The bll is drrbing!
Joey... are you sure? I mean, I know how much you love him!
What?
What?
Thank you! Hey, how'd the catering go?
Hi, Mindy. Hi, it-it's Rachel. Yeah, I'm fine. I-I saw Barry today. Oh, yeah, yeah he-he told me. No, no, it's okay. I hope you two are very happy, I really do. Oh, oh, and Mind, y'know, if-if everything works out, and you guys end up getting married and having kids- and everything- I just hope they have his old hairline and your old nose. Okay, I know it was a cheap shot, but I feel so much better now.
You're so sweet. Oh my God! And you gave the baby Hugsy!
Yah! She's... uhm... not very good though...
Because I'm married. That's right, I am a married woman! And I came to a TV star's apartment to have an affair! Uck!
Bitchin'
Okay, well, we brought you some wine.
'Cos I was gonna say there's no way you could've done the end the way you guys did it back then!
No, was he any good in it?
Hi, thanks for coming.
Ross, you stay here and talk, I'm gonna go have a baby.
I mean that's unbelievable.
I know them from work.
Hey! Ross and I were looking for you! What are we all doing in here? Oh, my!
Ohh... I mean two best friends falling in love, how often does that happen?
No, forget it! No way! I am not sending anymore Ralph Lauren clothes to prison. It is a waste.
No, I haven't had a chance to be alone with him yet.
Well no brush!
Hi, sure!
Goodnight.
No.
Oh yeah! I know.
Whoa, that Diet Coke just went straight to my head! Woo!
No, but it's good, you know, I'm gonna take some time off and do some charity work.
What?
Really?
Ah.
Thank you. Now are you sure? Because once I make a copy, there's no turning back.
That's a line from the show too!
This is it, isn't it? I mean, this is what my life is gonna be like. My mom there, my dad there. Thanksgiving, Christmas. She gets the house, he's in some condo my sister's gonna decorate with wicker. Oh, Chandler how did you get through this?
Sp-spoil?
Yes, hi!
I guess.
Take the top down did ya?
Oh... okay, just hide!
Bye.
Umm... I'm never gonna getting married!
It's worse than the thumb!
No! Come on its late, we're not gonna go down to the office.
Oh my God, Le Poo, our dog!
Oh, you know what, we haven't even looked yet.
Chandler? It's Alan, he wants to speak to you.
Ohh wow! I'm sorry, but Ross you kicked off your shoes!
You are right there with Emily. And it's y'know, it's kinda like.... it's a tie! Well, I gotta get, I gotta get back to the dishes.
Oh my God, Phoebe, Pottery Barn has ripped off the design of our antique!
Hey Mon? I'm gonna check my messages.
We love you, we're here for you.
Oh, well, she's asleep now. Stop forcing that thing on her.
Well, yeah! We're cool. Totally cool.
Ross! Phoebe's gonna be here any second, she cannot see this!
Because!
Yeah I know. She ran into him at my office and they just...made out. And the craziest thing is, now my boss likes me because I told her about it and she said it was the best gossip she'd heard all year.
Uh... Oh, Mindy, you are so stupid. Oh, we are both so stupid.
Yeah?
He is, isn't he? I don't know, I don't know, I mean maybe it's just being here at the beach together or, I don't know. But it's like something...
Come on. Oh! And, uh, by the way....
Well, basically, lately, I've uh, I've uh, sort of had feelings for you.
Hey!
Did you just push me?
Here it is! I love it. I wear it all the time.
Joey, get Amy's bags, she is moving out!
That is the sweetest thing, I just....
Hey Pheebs, you're still alive! How are you doing?
Wow. There it is, I see it.
Well, they said would but they would only give me store credit. I mean, what am I going to do, get a thousand regular cats?
Okay!
Yes.
What's the matter?
All right that's it! I am maid of honor!
Hello.
Virgo?
What?!
That sounds great.
Yes.
So uh, apparently people are familiar with the Europe story?
What are you saying?
Oh, I gotta get back to work.
So what do you say? Can I be your girlfriend again?
That-that is your make out buddy. Don't you recognize him? Oh wait. Ohh, Phoebe I love you. Kiss me please.
Nooo!
Oh.
Oh God Monica hi! I just went to your building and you weren't there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are, you are!
Hey Mon, look what I just found on the floor. What?
You know what else I'm not gonna miss? "I'm Monica. I wash the toilet 17 times a day. Even if people are on it!"
Okay! I was thinking if it's a girl, how about Sandrine? It's French.
Oh.... my God.
Mrs., Mrs. Gobb?
Would anybody like more coffee?
Hi! You might not remember us, but we are the girls that fogged you.
Ben y'know when uh, when you were a baby, you and I used to hang out all the time. 'Cause I was, I was your daddy's girlfriend.
Hi.
So, you had a good day huh? Big commission; picked up a daddy.
Oh uh-uh pal! Don't call me mommy! It's bad enough you call your own mother that.
No Paul, I don't know anything about you! Y'know, like-like your childhood! Tell me about your childhood!
Umm, I think there was a restaurant... I know there was wine. . .
Oh wow. That-y'know what? That is so unfair. Y'know what? Now I want to steal your thunder! Come on Ross, let's go have sex!
Wow! This explains so much! Last weekend, I went from store to store sitting on Santa's lap.
I have absolutely no idea.
No, I just mean that, you know, first impressions don't mean anything. And I-I think you're a really good guy and I'm sorry that I misjudged you.
Ummm, I think it's time to see the ring again.
Okay. Okay. Okay. Uh, what do I, what do I do with him?
Oh my God! Look what... you made it into a bunny. How did you do that?
Yeah, but he waited until the last minute! So if I said yes, he would know I had nothing better to do than wait around for an invitation to his stupid party. I said, "No!" Which puts me right back in the driver seat.
No...Yeah, all the time, constantly. It's terrifying. But you know that I figure it...it has to work out.
No.
What?!
Oh!
Oh, that is so hot. She walks around him to the other side)
We're gonna find love!
Exactly.
Ah, this place is great!
Yeah, well, feminism yes, but also the robots.
Oh no-no-no...
Monica, Monica, look at this lamp. Is this tacky or what? We have to have this.
He just kept asking, and asking, and asking, and asking, and asking, and asking.
Oh, you are the lesser of two evils!
Huh, that's funny. You look like you're gonna be the...
Ohh, ohh.
NO but Ross. We are never gonna happen, OK. Accept that.
Yes you are! Oh, I am so proud of you!
Joey, you're so sweet.
Bloomingdale's eliminated my department.
I can't believe Mark didn't call. It's Sunday night, and he didn't call.
Okay. Okay. It's-since you've never done it before you can be Monica's made of honor.
Yeah, umm, no honey.
Oh, great. Although I did sit down where there wasn't a chair.
Hi!
Phoebe, you were right. I should've never gone to London, and from now on you make all of my decisions for me.
Well, so, are-are you sure that there are three?!
What? This-this, no, oh no, no-no-no, this is not-that's-that's not what it is. See, see, okay, I work in fashion, see and-and, this is a real dress actually. It's-it's, they're-they're wearing it in Milan, so part of my job is too wear the clothes, and then I see how people respond, and then I report back to my superiors at Bloomingdale's, so... And obviously in uh, in-in this case, I am going to report back, "USA not ready."
No, I don't see it!
Why?! Why not?!
Hi!
Hey.
Oh, I just remembered. We do have something to eat. Monica put something in our oven this morning.
Whoa, look at you, you did pretty well.
Can you please, please take care of it for me?
I dunno.. I-I thought it looked better there. And I- and also, it's an extra seat around the coffee table.
Y'know I can't even worry about that right now, cause I got the cutie little baby, oh I can't believe how much I love her, I can't get enough of her, like right now I miss her. I actually miss her.
Do you really not know where I'm going with this? It left! It's one huge room!
Yeah I am, I am! Oh, but first of all, Monica, I would like to introduce you to my very talented colleage and more importantly my wonderful friend Gavin Mitchelle.
Yeah, sure.
Terry is a jerk, ok? That's why we're always saying "Terry's a jerk!" That's where that came from.
Honey, you're not gonna make enough money to help Frank and Alice just by selling knives.
I know, it's sick.
Alright you guys, I'm takin' off my shirt.
OK, ready when you are.
Ooooh, that's fine. We'll see who has the last laugh there, monkey boy.
Yeah! And she's comforted by him because she loves her uncle Joey so much.
I do too a little bit.
Oh, I'm not doing it alone. I have Ross.
The ring from the cave, yeah.
Right. So, what you have to do is, you have to accidentally run into her on purpose. And then act aloof.
I-I-I don't know.
Yeah, I mean, you know it, I mean, if it were me I, I, you know, I'd want you to, I don't know, like catch me off guard, you know, with like a really good kiss, you know really, sort of um, soft at first, then maybe um brush the hair away from my face, and look far into my eyes in a way that let's me know that something amazing is about to happen.
Please! During that second time you couldn't have picked her out of a lineup!
I'll help you throw out your purse.
Oh, I don't know. I don't know.
Oh, I would love to!
Okay, whoa-whoa easy there Melissa! This ain't a locker room, okay? But, y'know I remember him saying that-that he had plans tonight.
It's really not that big!
Look, y'know I know my life's going pretty well, but I look around and I just see so many people who've accomplished so many other goals by the time they're thirty.
I'm sorry. Oh God, I'm sorry, it's just that when you moved your hands down to my butt, it was like woah, Ross's hands are on my butt. Sorry.
Dark, big hair, with the airplane earrings.
Hi!
Oh come on Ross, why are we wasting our time with this other stuff?! We know what's gonna work! It's doctor recommended!
Ohh, there's a picture of her in the yearbook actually.
This is Chandler.
Okay.
I don't care about any of that!!
Phoebe, what? Umm...what?!
That's....
So hot I cried myself to sleep last night.
You know I...
I don't have any issues with my Father.
I'm trying to put Emma down for a nap, have you seen Hugsy?
Okay. You too. And I hope you score. Bye.
Hey! How was basketball?
Yeah I think so.
Huh-Wait so Joey if you get this, you're gonna be like the star of your own TV show! I mean you'll be like the Big Cheese! Or the Big Mac-Hey! You love those!
Well, this is really awkward Oh, and I can leave!
Why does it matter so much to you?!
Wow.
I didn't!
Who is it?
Honey, I'm sorry.
Well, I'll be waiting for you, just come up when you're done.
Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no, that's OK, I don't need them. I'm going for fours.
Joey!
I am so sick of guys. I don't want to look at another guy, I don't want to think about another guy, I don't even want to be near another guy.
Do you really want an award you didn't win?
Would you like to go to a basketball game with me? You know, its funny, basketball, because I happen to have tickets too... Umm, who likes the Knicks-
Oh!
See?
Oh my God.
Uh Ross? You asked me that.
Sure.
Thank God you're pretty.
No. Why?
Well, is Ross home? Maybe I'll just call him to see if he's actually seen her.
Well uh, yes and no. Except not no. So to sum it up, yeah.
No, no, no.... the, um, the... 'love' part?
Ross, why do you hate our child?
Okay fine! I'll-I'll just tell her it's an antique apothecary table, she doesn't have to know where it came from. Oh! Look at this little drawers! Oh look-look it says that it holds 300 CDs.
I don't know. Do I have to decide right now?
Seriously?
Honey, that's you're name.
Oh yeah, she can't be herself.
Oooooh. : Oh! I got an interview! I got an interview!
So uh, what are you guys doing for dinner tonight?
And did you notice...?
Who's there?
You are asking me to be your wife!
No! I do not care what my hormones are doing, I am not going to just do it with some random guy!
Joey look, just look at it this way, the sooner Phoebe breaks Chandler the sooner this is all over and out in the open.
Oh but Phoebe, we're gonna be late for the movie.
Oh, what is wrong with me lately? I mean it's like every guy I see-I mean look here. Look at that guy for example, I mean normally that's not someone I would-would be attracted to, but right now, with the way I'm feeling, all I want to do is rip off his sweatpants and fanny pack.
Oh, god, this is great! The plane is gone, so it looks like I'm stuck here with you guys.
Hey Joey!
Okay, here we go...
...It's kinda hard though!
Oh, no! No you guys! Come on, you don't have to do that! I'm happy for him! I am! I really-I'm-I'm happ-I'll work on it.
Oh, Pheebs, I don't even know where to start.
Was she good?
It was nice to meet you.
What?
You guys wanna get some coffee?
And she's not crazy?
So....
You're right, you're right. I should just tell her the truth.
Thanks, but I gotta go to work and get my eyes scratched out by Mindy.
Can you not look at me when I say this? I thought that if I could get you here, I could seduce you.
But you did! I mean, let's be honest.
Yeah, sure. Umm...here.
No! If there was I wouldn't tell you.
Oh my God! That's the creepiest thing I've ever heard!
I-Ohh!
Don't say anything. I don't wanna speak, I don't wanna think. I just want you to take me and kiss me and make love to me right here, right now.
What?!
No?
Oh, let me see! Oh, God, is he just the sweetest thing? You must just want to kiss him all over!
Can I please be there when you tell her?
I am. Let me just get my coat.
Really?
Oh, come on, would you just grab my ass.
Hi.
'Gone for more jars. Back later. Monica Geller.'
What?
I'm serious, I really, I think I need just to have some...meaningless, sex y'know, with the next guy that I see.
Ross, Joey is not here.
She's actually very sweet and we used to be very close.
Well actually...
Chandler, you stole this cheesecake. That is wrong.
Joey no, this is wrong! You have to take it back, okay? You don't want to win an award this way. You're very talented. And someday you're gonna win one of these for real and that one is gonna mean something.
Oh.
What do you, what do you mean?
Well it's only different if he wants it to be. I mean, I'm not gonna ask him for anything.
It was unbelievable!
Joey...
Hi.
Hi!
You know what I really really want?
No-no-no! This chair's not going anywhere.
Okay! No accountants. Oh, and no one from like legal. I don't like guys with boring jobs.
Wait, you can't go away this weekend! It's Emma's birthday!
All right, then you owe me $350.
Hi!!
You're not an artist.
Oh no, I'm good, I don't wanna get that turkey smell all over my hands.
Yeah that's right! Come on Joey; sex me up!
I had one.
Well, I've brought some books. We could read.
Oh! Well you're just the prettiest ballerina I've ever seen.
Okay, here we go.
What's the matter?
No, y'know what? It's gonna be okay. I mean you don't have to have this rustic Italian feast. Y'know? And-and you don't need, you don't need this custom-made, empire waisted, duchess, satin gown; you can wear off the rack.
Okay..
God! Don't-We can't let her start getting ready! This is too awful! Oh God, but wait she'll be in the gown and then he won't show up and then she's gonna have to take off the gown...
Ohh, I mean it's just so realistic!
Ah, it's still not the time.
Yeah. Well, umm.....
Boy, you really can't stand to lose, can you? Your whole face is getting red... little veins popping out on your temple...
Honey, might I suggest watching a little more ESPN and a little less E!?
Okay. I'll miss you.
Okay.
You're bachelor pad?!
That is the most ridiculous...
Yes I can!
Thank you. What? You don't want to see this do you?
Gotta go! Hi! Wow! There you go!
What...that scene I saw was so good!
Wow. Well, I guess it was Cupid who brought her here.
What? Guys, I'm not.
Oh my God! What does that thing do?
Ooohhhh!!
Hi, I'm Rachel Green. What can I do for you Joshua?
What?! Why? Joey you were so ready for it!
Great! Now he's gonna know it was me!
What?
Seriously. What?!
Well, I was gonna, but I accidentally read something else.
I'm sorry. What?
Hmm. Do you think-Could you tell me if she's hanging in, in a one bedroom or a two?
But it was beautiful. I mean it was small, but kind of spectacular.
Hi!
But why, why not?
Oh, hi!
Hey!
Y'know?
You got it!
OK, I'm doin' it for ya.
OK, well, you wouldn't let me finish and I was jus- Ow. That hurt
No-no-no-no-no Ross! Please, come on we do not have any of the big stuff we need! We do not a changing table! We do not have a crib! We do not have a diaper service!
Joey...
Well that works out good, because I'm not listening.
Yeah Melissa, I don't want to be known as the uh, office bitch, but I will call your supervisor.
Ohhhhhh, look it's the roller blades.
Ohh, please! Cooking soothes me. Ahh. So, dig in!
What? They were like this!
Yeah, I'm doing okay. I'm um...let's talk.
Oh, it's a Macy's bag!
Oh, no, no no. I meant that he's gonna be paying that other woman beause she's a professional.
Oh, well you know who I love the most?
Nooo! Hello? Oh, yeah, no, I know, I-I haven't been using it much. Oh, well, thanks, but, I'm okay, really.
Come on Ross give me the keys! Monica does not know what she's talking about! I am an excellent driver!
Thank you judges.
Okay-okay-okay-okay-okay-okay-okay! I got it! I got it! I got it! I can't! I can't! I can't! I cannot go with you and my sister thing. Okay? I just can't. It's just too weird, all right? I imagine the two of you together and I freak out. It freaks me out. I can't do it! I can't do it.
Uh yes, heroin and crack.
You give me back my sweater or it's handbag marinara.
Ross said my name up there, I mean, come on, I just can't pretend that didn't happen can I?
You went shopping?! What, and then you just came in here and paraded it right under Jill's nose when you know she's trying to quit. Wow, you guys are terrible!
Yes!
No....
Oh, wow thanks! Oh you're in real estate!
Bye-bye Julie.
Y'know, it is not like I did this on purpose.
Hang in there. You hang in there.
Hey!
Ross, hi, it's Rachel. I'm just calling to say that um, everything's fine and I'm really happy for you and your cat who, by the way, I think you should name Michael. And, you know, ya see there I'm thinking of names so obviously, I am over you. I am over you and that, my friend, is what they call closure.
Well, because she loves you and because you love her.
Come on, just answer the question!
Uhm... you haven't told these guys what they're doing in the wedding yet.
They're in a caaar...
Ross! Janice?!
No. And then I called him, and he wasn't there.
Oh, he sees her!
Well, you know what? This is great. Finally, I have someone I can pass on my wisdom too. Let me tell you about a couple of things I learned while working at the coffeehouse. First of all, the customer is always right. A smile goes a long way. And if anyone is ever rude to you? Sneeze muffin.
You guys this cat is nothing like my grandmother's cat. I mean, it's not sweet, it's not cute, I even dragged that little string on the ground, and it just flipped out and scratched the hell out of me. And I swear, I know this sounds crazy, but every time this cat hisses at me I know it's saying, "Rachel!"
Okay.
Awww, awww, it's beautiful.
Me? I'm great! I'm fine! I'm sooo good!! But, you know who's not great?! Men! You're a man right Ross?!
Yeah honey, I'm standing right there! Why didn't you just tell him about the mole I haven't got checked yet.
Well, we never actually got to dinner.
Oh, I know...
Yeah, that'd be great. I'd love it.
I didn't know there were docks.
Wow, this is a tough one. I think I'm gonna have to go with the dog.
Aside from the fact that you said you had them?
Yes.
No well, no it's not that bad, y'know? I mean yeah, my tongue feels a little fuzzy and these fingers sort of smell, I actually feel like I can throw up.
All right here he comes. I'm gonna do this, I'm gonna tell him, I'm gonna be strong.
Umm, or, maybe, I should stay away from all men.
Okay. Oh wait! Umm, did you send those contracts to Milan?
Who are you supposed to be?
Really?! How come we didn't cross paths?
That's great, great. So do you have any questions for us?
I might know something too.
And thank you for your time.
Oh, sure! Do you need me to train somebody new?
All right, y'know-Fine! You guys have your stupid little club, but I would just like to say is what you did to me is way worse than what I did to you! You gave me a tiney-wienie!
No Phoebe, I am not letting you put makeup on my baby!
I don't know.
So why don't you just let me worry about making the trifle and you just worry about eating it, alright?
Oh, well, that shouldnt be so hard, now that youre dating. "Sweetheart, youre fired, but how bout a quickie before I go to work?"
Hey uhm, do you remember that one really great time...?
Its still there!
Okay. Y'know what? I'd have to say I really don't care for your tone. And this is not the only hospital in this city and we have no problem to-Whoa! Oh gosh! Whoa!
Why? Why today?
Right.
Well, I used to date him, but you're still going out with her!
It's me! Good morning!
For Stella! Remember? She's gettin' her grove back in like 20 minutes.
No, no, that's ok. You won fair and square. I'm so sad!
So uh, Pheebs, honey, how are those mood swings coming?
Oh well yeah me too. Um.. I had a baby.
Hey, Sophie!
Hey!
What?
All right!
Oh, did you beat him at a board game? He turns into such a baby when he starts to lose.
Ohh, well I'm not totally back yet, but thank you.
Yeah?
Ahhhhh, salmon skin roll.
Really? Me?
Yeah, I just have to get dressed.
Hey, guys, what's up.
Ugh, you will not believe what that sleaze-ball from Ralph Lauren did too me!
Yeah, we ended up spending the day together and had such a great time!
Oh!!
Monica, I'm quitting! I just helped an 81 year old woman put on a thong and she didn't even buy it! I'm telling you I'm quitting! That's it! I'm talking to my boss right now! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Okay bye, call me when you get this message.
Don't do that.
has your girlfriend got the butt?
Thank you.
Oh!
I hate this apartment! I hate the color of these walls! I hate the fact that this place still smells like bird! I hate that singing guy!
Why the hell didn't you tell me!
Well, I have to be, I don't really have a choice, I mean, you know, I could look at the bright side, I get two birthday parties and two birthday cakes.
Oh, maybe that's Emily calling back to leave the exact same message.

What?!
Huh ha ha!
Phoe-be!!
What...how is it going with Drake?
No.
Well, don't look at me! My hair's straight! Straight! Straight! Straight!
Oh, Mon, sure.
What?
Ohhh!!!!
Honey, honey, I'm sorry, I know it's our anniversary but I told you on the phone I don't have time to stop.
Are you kidding?!
Alright. So where'd you grow up?
As are you...
Oh, umm, okay, yeah, I'll be, yeah I'll be right back.
Okay.
Oh, you're not gonna believe what happened to me today! Ralph Lauren called, and gave me my job back!
Wow! What did he do?
These are from Halloween three years ago.
Ohh, okay, how about five. Ohh, thank you.
Hey.
Okay.
Oh...
Yeah, remember that thing I told you that happened yesterday? Well it didn't happen.
I, uh, think you already are.
Ok, Barry's letters. Adam Ritter's boxer shorts.
Sure! Why?
Wow! Would I have seen you in anything?
Okay, well, I'm gonna clear out some of these boxes.
Hmm. Umm, why do you have a copy of The Shining in your freezer?
Well why shouldn't I?!
Oh, I know, I know, it's-it's so, it's so totally like, "Whoa! Can we do this?" Y'know, I mean, but I mean it just feels right! Don't you think? It does! I mean, it just feels right, don't you think?
Oh! Phoebe, why did you lie to me about working here?
What? What's the matter?
Oh, give me!
Hey!
O-okay, now see, you never ever ever told us that...
God. I have never been so uncomfortable in my entire life!
So umm, you're gonna stay with me as long as I need you?
Oh yes, of course, I remember him!
Well, I was kinda supposed to be headed for Aruba on my honeymoon, so nothing!
So ah, did you have fun at the bachelor party last night?
Noo! I wish! Okay, you ready?
Thanks.
Umm.
Oh God, oh God, it's sowed on though.
Were both of those Joey?
Ok I gotta tell ya, it's really weird when you use my whole name.
So did they call you to tell you your name's gonna be in this?
What about all the women you want to bring home?
Oh God twenty seconds my ass!!
What?
Yes!
And all these people actually died?
And with Chandler in the next room. What are you, what are you sick?
OK, here we go. Honey, I'm sorry, they were all out of apple pie, someone just got the last piece.
Okay, wait a minute. Wait a minute, I-I-I, I can't do this. Listen honey, this is, it's not Phoebe's fault. She lent me the earrings, and I lost it. I'm so sorry. Honey, I feel terrible too.
Oh, ok, which one?
But I don't want you to.
No.
I'm not! This is what I'm doing now. I've got this job-
Honey, I'm just checking.
Oh, no, no. That is a doll.
Well, what happened to your jam plan?
Okay, Phoebe, honey, you gotta be kidding. I mean, you know you cannot keep one of these babies!
Ross! We broke up two years ago; you've been married since then. I think it's okay that we see other people.
I mean do you have any fun, you know, fantasy type things?
Hey, now wait a minute! I get when you told people at first that you wanted to be an actor they laughed at you! Now come on Bobby, why don't you tell us a little bit about your band?
Well that's his last name.
All right, bye-bye.
Wow, I am so glad I'm not Monica right now.
Well, I'm sorry, I thought you needed them!
So we're okay, we're okay, we're okay, aren't we? No, we're not okay, we're not okay, there's a bump, there's a bump.
Don't call us that!
Hey.
Yeah, that didn't work.
If anybody asks, I'm your sister, Joan. Listen. C'mon, you guys. Ross said my name up there that obviously means that he still loves me!
That's just great.
Pretty much.
Do you have any ice?
New people.
Monica is Ross' sister.
Oh, sorry, it's my phone. Hello?
Well maybe he saw your hand slip briefly from the ten and two o'clock position.
My boss wants to buy my baby!
Good luck to you.
Yeah no, I mean it was at a flea market, so it was y'know, it was like a dollar.
I'm having a baby.
Oh... Well...
Well, I just called Joshua...
No! No, of course not. No. That's why I brought it up. They didn't have any sodas?
Yeah?
Hi Pheebs.
No-no, they just had a big blowout over what to do with my room.
Oh, okay. Hey, can I ask you a question? Was it me, or-or was the guy who took my blood sample really cute? Y'know who I'm talking about, bald haircut, hairy fingers...
Shhh.
Thank you! And now if you'll excuse me, I have to go to the rest room.
Thank you doctor. Oh thank you for being so nice and calm.
What?
Yes! Bye daddy.
Well... well, what did you do to make her laugh?
Ooooh! Wow!! Oh, hi.
Ya know, Dr. Burke kissed me once.
Ooh, do I sense a little bit of resentment?
Well,sounds like you two have issues.
Hey!
So now, what are you doing here?
I haven't seen him in so long!
All right Monica, do you want to know why I was with Ross tonight?!
I'm just visiting my good friend Carol.
What? No! It's not a big deal! I do that too, with my shampoo bottle.
Oh no. No-no! I think my water just broke.
You know what?
What-what if I marry Ross-Or Joey?
Oh good. Ahhh! My God, sorry!
Hi.
Uh well, I guess I'm not gonna miss the fact that you're never allowed to move the phone pen.
Really?
What?
Get up!
For what?
No we weren't! It was nothing! It was one night, senior year we went to a party, had a lot of sangria and y'know, ended up...kissing for a bit.
But you are a liar.
What, slept together a year and a half ago? Yeah, I'm all set.
Honey, you can say it, Poconos, Poconos, it's like Poc-o-nos
Op, ice. I need ice.
Hi there!
Huh, well maybe it uh, it changed.
Go!!
Oh God, it says he was hit by an ice cream truck and dragged for nine--teen blocks. Oh. Oh my God.
Ross couldn't fit down the trash chute.
You do that every year??
He got it a flea market!
I don't think so.
Jealous of what? Of your lack of responsiblity? You, your immaturity? Your total disregard of other people's feelings?
Oh, god, I can't believe one of us actually has one of these.
You have been maid of honor before?!!
What Phoebe? Wait! One time he caught me smoking he said if he ever saw me doing that again he'd make me eat the entire pack.
Yeah, but it was different with him today! And he wasn't, like, Orthodontist Guy, y'know? I mean, we had fun! Is there anything wrong with that?
Ok, I know this is gonna sound really stupid, but I feel that if I can do this, you know, if I can actually do my own laundry, there isn't anything I can't do.
No! Phoebe, it's not Gunther.
Sweety, I gotta tell ya... it sounds a little bit like you like the apartment more than you like...
Okay, I do.
Oh my god.
All right. Hey-hey-hey!! Sandwiches!
Okay, you look in the kitchen, I will look in the back closet.
Monica, what should I do?
Ok.
All right, well the place was closed. I'll just copy it later.
Phoebe?! Wait a-but-but she just, she said that Joey was her backup.
"Yeah." "Me too."
You guys, you're never gonna believe what I just found tacked up on a telephone pole! Look kinda familiar?
I was laughing! You made me laugh!
Uh, no she doesn't but I can, I can get a message to her.
You do?
Yeah that's right you weren't thinking! Y'know what? Let me give you something to think about!
Huh.
Ross! Y'know what, I just got-why? Why did you do this?!
Pheebs, Monica tripped me, I don't think I can ever run again, ever!
Hey you.
No! No! Seriously, what's wrong with the dog?! Wait a minute, what are you doing home so early? What happened to your date?
I think I am.
What?! You got us evicted!!
C'mon, seriously, you guys, you're not going to make me watch this alone!
Yeah, actually that's my roommate's.
Yah, I'll have the soup and the salmon.
It depends on who asked.
Well, look, it's hardly snowing anymore. I mean you couldn't ask for a more romantic setting. This could be the simple wedding you've always wanted!
He was right there. He got down on one knee and proposed.
Why aren't you guys at the movie?
OK, you wanna play? OK, let's play, let's play.
Do you even know what a vicar is?
Oh, no, no, I don't have one. I just need to talk to my friend.
Everything's ruined. My bed. My clothes. Look at my favorite blue sweater.
Well, there you go. You win, you win. You get to do the presentation, you'll knock 'em dead, no one will ever remember that I worked here, and then Ralph will buy his helicopter, and Super Gavin will just fly right along side of him!
Yeah, I do.
No? Y'know, I can tie one of these into a knot using just my tongue.
Absolutely! Absolutely. I d... it's just a little weird, it's you, and it's me, it's just gonna take some getting used to.
Hey!
No, you know what, I think you should go.
No. No, she told me his name was Ken Adams.
Oh, yeah.
I meant, me plus one!
Oh yeah! But you know what? If you need Hugsy, don't worry. Emma will totally understand. I won't... but whatever .
Okay.
No.
Pheebes, this woman is voluntarily bald.
Wow, oh my God, our child will be beaten to death in the schoolyard.
Well, I'm really sick of your smoking, so I brought something that is going to help you quit.
You still think of it as your apartment, don't you?
Goodbye, baby.
Yeah, he thought he broke your chair so he switched the chairs!
What?
Its back in cage!
Well, we're not here to meet guys. You have a boyfriend, I have a b. . . baby and a Ross.
Oh, I'm sorry. Ross Tillman.
Well, you're not totally paranoid.
Both of them are here, both of them, both of them are here?
Oh. Oh my God, is that Phoebe?
He left work in the middle of the day to do a personal errand and left you in charge when you've been working here two days? That's not, that's not right.
Monica, is this true?
You love her.
Gay? Yeah.
Just tell me how.
This is totally your fault!
I don't know, I'd leave it on the changing table? What?! What'd I do? What'd I do?!
Yeah, what're you saying, you just sort of put away feelings or whatever the hell it was you felt for me?
Puzzler. A bit of a puzzle. Why don't you um, check the copy room, maybe you left the contracts in there?
Oh, yeah.
leave...
Yeah, well, I gotta work, I'm sorry.
All right, straight, and not subtle.
Uh. No.. I was going to let you use my Ralph Lauren discount.
And also, you know I uh, I was thinking about what you said, you know, about the whole sex thing and... it's probably not a great idea to go down that road again.
Oh, I can't. Because I-I've seen them.
Okay. Okay, great! Umm, okay, just turn around.
I was gonna give you a chance to apologise to me.
I know. Days of Our Lives, thank you very much.
That-that you came on to me?
Hi!
Now, what exactly is in a cobb salad?
Hi.
Oh, uh, Joanna I was wondering if I could ask you something. There's an opening for an assistant buyer in Junior Miss...
Okay.
Wow... I really love your...
Jill, honey, I think this is the best thing that could've ever happened to you. I mean you needed to get out on your own anyway! And you know when I did it, I-I-I at first I was scared, and look at me now! I'm the only daughter dad is proud of! Okay, well this is, this is what you're gonna do. You're gonna get a job, you're gonna get an apartment, and then I'll help you and you can stay with us. Right Pheebs, she can stay with us?
I'm so sorry.
I'd need an expense account.
Well what are we going to do?
Was she good?
Whatever! Okay, I'm not your mother.
No.
I think, if it was a little colder in here I could see your nipples through that sweater.
Oh? Yeah! Sure!
Whoops. Oh, hey, do you need help with that?
Uh, I'm holding Ben.
Nah, uh, uh, uh, uh.
Oh my God, I'm so sorry.
Wow, a Swedish massage from a real Swedish person.
I-I don't want your job. I-I don't. Ohh this is such a mistake. I did not make out with him. Nobody made out with him. I did not use my keycard yesterday. I don't even know how to use my keycard.
Monica!!!
What was the book?
Tell him.
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! I'm sorry, semi-private? We , we asked for a private room.
I couldn't be inner. Monica?
I would love to!
Thank you, Okay, Okay.
She's yours!
Yeah.
Yes! Yes! Yes, you do want to know! This is unbelievable!
I know, I mean, why can't parents just stay parents? Why do they have to become people? Why do they have... Why can't you stop staring at my breasts?
Yes!
But what choice did I have. He was keeping my sister in a dungeon!
I was giving you an appology and you were totally checking her out!
You guys, does this look like something the girlfriend of a paleontologist would wear?
Ugh.
Uh. Did you call your parents?
You should find out what his hobbies are and then use that to bond with him. Yeah! Like if I would strike up a conversation about say umm, sandwiches. Or uh, or my underwear.
Uhh, hang in there?
I just, I feel, I-I just...
Insane!
Oh. Right.
Or maybe you would see me looking embarrassed because you are talking on the phone with your crotch!
Yeah but, my assistant Tag does sit-ups in the office during lunch. Ohh! I could just spread him on a cracker.
I'm just going to grab the phone.
You were supposed to be in there so I could see your thing!
And you are so in style right now. Y'know, I work at Ralph Lauren and the whole fall line has got this like equestrian theme going on. I don't suppose you saw the cover of British Vogue, but...
Monica's gonna marry a millionaire!!!
Sorry.
What do you mean, you fold? Hey, come on! What is this? I thought that 'once the cards were dealt, I'm not a nice guy.' I mean, what, were you just full of it?
Ugh, the worse day! Y'know, you think you're making progress at work and then your boss calls you Raquel.
Remember when we were in high school together?
I think you should go.
He's downstairs getting the rest of the stuff out of the cab.
Wow! Tell me something Joey--Whoa! I just fell right off the couch there.
Julie.
I'll take all of your photos and put them into photo albums!
Yes, Chandler, that's exactly what it is. It's your hair.
Okay.
Wow! Wow. Wow. Wow, it is hot in here.
People keep saying that. Oh I'm sorry Gavin.
Wow. She does that a lot!
Ohh! Yeah! Yeah that-that would've been a much simpler problem.
Hello.
Okay, it's not Relaxi Cab. It's Relaxicab, like taxicab.
Who's this from?
Oh! Oh my God! I thought she was on Atkins.
Get the hell out of there, y'know?
Ye-, no, my Uncle Hi.
Ok, look you guys, I really don't want to get into this right now. I think it'll just make everyone uncomfortable.
And hey! Just so you know, it's not that common! It doesn't happen to every guy! And it is a big deal!!
Yeah, sure. All right, whose court is the ball in now?
Ohh, nothing, I just wanted to see you. See you and hug you. See you.
Absolutely. Shoop, shoop, shoop. Only a hundred and two dollars to go.
Which you're not, because you've totally hung up on him!
'Cause I know he's gonna flip out and I hate it when he's angry.
Alright, I feel that this is totally unjustified. She gave me the green light, I did nothing but-. Do you think I can't see you in the TV set?
Oh honey...
Oh God, I can't believe you're making such a big deal about this. It was one kiss, one guy, one time!
Well tell us! What are they?
And ya know what, now I've got closure.
Well, that doesn't sound like a very merry Christmas.
Monica, your dad just beeped in, but can you make it quick? Talking to Rome. I'm talking to Rome.
Whoa-oh, what's-what's that?
Well you could've untied it with your hands.
Oh yeah. In fact you know what I'd do?
Yeah, maybe...
A birthday party.
Maybe that's all we do, what about Julie?
Well, I'll ask him for you, if you want me too?
Oh, no, meh-nah-nah-nah, come on you're gonna ruin it!
No, you're right, you are absolutely right. I mean that makes, that makes everything different.
Hi.
Awww, just like his daddy.
Of course I packed! Monica relax! I just wanted to ask Phoebe her opinion on what I should wear tonight.
That's funny.
Really, really not.
I'm just making margaritas.
Yeah...
Are they in love?
Oh, I'm sorry! Do you need the phone?
Yes! But what is wrong with this dog?!
Oh, I went to have pizza. With Danny.
Well it's mine too! What else you got?!
What happened?
Yeah.
What's with the rain, Geller? I mean, when I signed up for Dino Week, nobody said anything about it being monsoon season.
Uh-huh.
Why are you adding, why are you adding, why are you adding, why are you adding?
Or?
Wow!!
You have a roommate?!
But Pheebs, y'know you earned it.
All right, fine, but don't get mad at me. It's-it's just a little hard to believe.
Ohh, well you got 'em.
Ohhh.
Ross honey, this is very nice, but, but I-I got a crisis.
Hi! Thanks, hey so uh what'd you do last night?
Bye bye Mike!/Cya mike!/Bye mike!/Bye bye now!
: Sak's... Fifth... Avenue.
Ross do you realise this is the first time in my life I'm doing something I actually care about. This is the first time in my life I'm doing something that I'm actually good at. I mean. if you don't get that...
Hi!
Give it here. Oh, God.
Well of course I do! But y'know, favorite returning character is a tough category Joey. I mean you're up against the guy who survived his own cremation.
No!
I really do.
Ooh, the gift shop!
'Okay. Okay, daddy we'll see you tomorrow night. Okay bye-bye.'
Honey wait, Joey, I'm sorry I mean as terrific as I think you are with it...
Oh I don't-I don't know.
Yeah, why is it so hard for you to believe?!
Oh, I remember how we almost. Do you think we would've gone through with it? Y'know, if we hadn't gotten caught. Do you think we would've done it?
She's totally right! When we were together, you got all freaked out about Mark and there was nothing going on.
Well that was depressing, I think I just bought a soft pretzel from one of the kids from Fame. Ready to go to the movies?
I, I didn't say any... I sw... I did not say anything, I swear. He stopped by.
Hey! Wait a minute! That was different! I did those things because I was in love with you!
Oh. Well then, you better go take that back because they're gonna charge you for that.
Stop picturing it!!
Oh, right, clink.
Right.
So what-what is the exhibit.
You stole them from me!!
He was a hamster! I am not going to vacuum up my baby!
No.
Did-did you come up here to work on that term paper or something?
Uh-huh, yeah I did, because I wore out my first copy when I was with you.
Uh, Pheebs? Who's George Snuffalopagus?
Oo, toes!! Well, for some people.
Well hello! So, when are we gettin' back out on the water matey?
Wow! Look at that, Chip Matthews called. I wonder what he wants?
Yeah.
I don't gossip!
Ah, a little preview!
Well of course we will help you decide! We will do anything we can to help you! Now, I would like to make a toast, to the future Mrs. Chandler Bing , my best friend, and truly one of the nicest people that...
Wait, I-I just said "leave."
Monica, how come you never told me this?!
Hi!
Alright, I can't, I can't wait that long. You have to do something-knock that door down!
All right, easy mimey, the moment has passed, it ain't gonna happen!
Awww, no, it's okay, we've actually known for a while.
No.
Okay, just a little scared. What's going on Ross?
Oh, I probably shouldn't-so I will! Oh! Wow! It's like it's raining!
How do you think this suit would look on an assistant buyer at Bloomingdale's?
All right, listen, missy. If you want this cart, you're gonna have to take me with it!
I know... Honey, seriously, I did it all. The luggage that I'm taking is in the bedroom, this is Emma's Paris stuff, these are the boxes that I'm having shipped, and that's the sandwich that I made for the plane...
I mean n-not-not fake at all like most famous people.
Hi!
Um, this is gonna sound kinda goofy but uhhm, my friend over there, who cooks by the way, um, she thinks you're cute.
Well, I, umm...
It was an amazing night.
When did you go to a sperm bank?
Oh! I knew it! What happened?
What's the big deal? Why don't you wanna see Janice?
Yes, yes, it does. Okay, look, the restaurant called, they wanna know if you're gonna be showing up for work?
What?! You-you actually thought that basket was gonna get you the apartment?
Look at it, isn't it beautiful?
I got off the plane.
Oh no, you guys, just stay here, I'm gonna go check her diaper, Pheebs you wanna come?
Hi, I'm here to see mr Campbell... with Gucci. The reservation is probably under Gucci. It's spelled like Gukki, which could be confusing.
I am sooo drunk.
Yes! Great! Give me those cigs! Give it! Give it!
Well guys tend to get naked before they're gonna have sex.
Not right now.
Ross said there's still no word from Chandler.
Oh no, I can't tell you until you tell me what you know.
You, you, you said he liked me. You, you slowpokes!
: We have apple cinnamon...
O-o-o-okay, how did it go? Tell me everything.
OK.
Ohh, wait a minute, we haven't pre...
Okay, bla-bla-bla-bla!! Who is it?!
Ross, hi, it's Rachel. I'm just calling to say that um, everything's fine and I'm really happy for you and your cat......I am over you. I am over you and that, my friend, is what they call closure.
All right. What's your news, Amy?
Oh, I know. Hey, y'know what we never did? Oh no, not that. We uh, we never had bonus night!
Oh! Whoops! I'm sorry, you were talking about Emily!
Oh, I know, I know.
Oh please, you inhale your food!
I don't care about the little dude! I can't! I cannot listen to anymore of this! Y'know, the only person who would want to listen to this is a mental health professional! And then it's only because they get paid $100 an hour! Do you know how much money I could've made listening to you? $2,000! And do you know when I figured that out? While you were talking!
Ok, doggie get the- aahhh. Ok go get the sandwich, get the sandwich doggie. Good doggie get the sandwich, get the...ok, Joey, the dog will lick himself but he will not touch your sandwich, what does that say?
Not in the street!!
I know, I know. And oh, and this time Chip promised that-that this time it will last at least for an entire song!
Oh yeah, sure.
Yay! Emily!
No. No, no, I'm not ready! How can I be ready? "Hey, Rach! You ready to jump out the airplane without your parachute?" Come on, I can't do this!
I'm Monica's maid of honor. Okay? Don't try to blue pin me!
Oh sure. Older?
Monica...would you please tell Joey that he is a pig?
Yeah, totally! You are in such good hands. And I'm so good with meeting parents. With the father, you know, you want to flirt a little bit, but not in a gross way. Just kind of like: "Oh mr. Pincer, I can see where Wallis gets his good looks..."
Well that sounds kinda cool, kinda like The Hobbit.
Okay? Wait okay, tell-tell me that you like him, please? I mean tell me that you like him.
No, wait. Wait.
Okay.
Okay, y'know what, y'know what? This playing hard to get thing is not working. Umm, hand-hand me those cherries. Okay. Okay. Hi!
No! Sorry, I just thought you were somebody else. Hi!
I don't know. Maybe I'll know when I see him.
What, what, what, no, I don't wanna do that.
That proposal, at the planetarium...
Hi!
I've never lived like this before.
Damn! I wish I knew if that was right!
Oh, Chandler that is so nice.
Ugh! Look you guys, I'm really excited about this! Okay? I don't care what you think! I'm gonna go set up a little litter box for Mrs. Whiskerson. Well, what am I gonna call her? Fluffy?!
So who else was in this club?
Yeah.
Well then you just must have a natural talent for it.
Yeah but-but-but you liked me! Oh my God, I can't believe this, all this time, I liked you and you liked me!
You are soo enjoying this.
Which one do you think she is?
You have no respect for anybody's privacy!
Oh, thank you so much for coming. Ross, get in here!
OK, so that's... that's what, two bottles? And yet somehow we went through five?
Oh yeah! Actually, that's one of the reasons why we're not a couple.
You're welcome.
Hey, hubby!
Ah yes, but he's very protective of me so you'd better watch yourself.
We are looking for our Christmas presents from Monica.
Already? That's pretty bad what you did.
But I saved it. I put my basket on top.
No, no, no. It's ok. I'm gonna be fine.
Cecilia Monroe man, what a great actress.
Emma! See? I don't want it.
I don't know! Maybe they have tools.
Well, maybe you didn't want it to end?
Okay, honey, what he means by that, is ...while this is a very nice gift, maybe it's just not something a boyfriend gives?
Yes!!
And I'm Rachel, an admirer of the building.
Oh...
Oh, nothing, he's just goofy like that, I actually, hardly notice it anymore.
What?
Oh, making it worse!
Hey, how's...how's the uh, miracle chair?
What? What secrets? You know secrets? What are they?
Yes.
You can go.
Closure, that's what it is. Closure. Hello, excuse me. Excuse me, hel. . . woo
You know what? I've been thinking about it. I'm really coming around on the name Ruth. I think I would actually consider naming our child that.
Well, if anyone is keeping score, I no longer eat tuna.
Oh!
Ohh, hi, Kim.
Why not?
And you know, we said that we would, we would live together as long as this makes sense. An maybe this, you know,Just doesn't make sense anymore.
Bye house!
Is Monica around? I-I have to ask her something.
Although...
Oh, okay, well, I think we should let Phoebe decide, because she's the only who's impartial, and she's so pretty.
Yes! That I know, this is from White Plains.
No. No-no-no-no.
What if I clean your bathroom for a month?
What?
Oh really, OK.
So, Spin The Bottle works like this I spin the bottle, it lands on Gunther, so I would have to kiss Gunther. (She crawls over to where Gunther is sitting and sees the look of anticipation on Gunther's face and decides not to kiss him.) All right. Who wants to go first?
Oh my God!
Uh-huh!
Luisa? Oh my God! Monica! It's Luisa!
Eavesdropping. Pheebs, the ceiling tiles were falling down.
Wait-wait-wait, I just thought of another story about how nice Ross is!
Oh, Ross...
I know, it's huge, and it's scary, and it's... really far, far away from you guys, but this is such an incredible opportunity for me. And I've already talked to them about our situation with Emma, and they said they'll do whatever we need to make us feel comfortable.
That would be great! Wait, how long is Denise gone for?
He got all weird and sputtery and then he said uh, "Yeah, I hear those hemorrhoids are a bitch."
Wow, so why don't you go talk to him?
Joey, what-what are you doing going into my bedroom?!
What?!
Sophie sit!!
Okay. Wait! Wait!
I mean maybe you didn't hear about a serious relationship called me and Joshua?
Joey...there's something that you...should know. Dina?
Wow.
I think it's sexy.
Oh, me too.
It's coming from Joey!
Yeah, I-I don't care.
Well, uh, I-I don't know. See when-when you put it that way y'know it does sort of...
I'm an assistant buyer!!
This one?
Good ones?
That cute waiter guy from your restaurant, the one that looks like a non-threatening Ray Liotta?
Oh honey, thank you, but Mark's taking me out.
Okay, I'm totally cool!
What are you talking about Pheebs? I don't... Oh my God, you drew on me?!
Yeah, but she also invited you and Ross. Yeah, honey, I'm sorry, but I don't think that was a romantic thing.
I am feeling nothing. Speaking of hot, watching you do that really makes me want to have sex with you.
Honey, this really is an incredible thing to do for them, but there are things to think about.
I'm not gonna gooo, so I think that will accomplish the not going.
Y'know, with the right pair of pumps, that would be a great little outfit.
Did you just say Hi, Jew?
Okay, hi. Ladies and gentlemen, back by popular demand, Miss Phoebe Buffay. Wooh!
Yeah. Your teeth? Yes, I saw them from outside. You guys are never going to believe this. But, Phoebe made out with Ralph Lauren.
Hello! Here we go!
Phoebe!! Phoebe!! It's okay!! It's okay!!
Okay, a thousand.
Jill this is not about me being jealous of you! This is about you being a brat! Wanting what you can't have!
Okay. Okay. Okay. Umm, maybe you can start with, "Chandler, even though we were friends; there was a part of me that always knew I wanted more."
Thank you. So are we good?
Barry was the guy that I was almost married and Mindy was my best friend.
Oh, okay!
You!
Ball? There is no ball.
Oh, honey, I'm sure there's nothing wrong with the plane.
Right.
Joey...
Oh don't even ask!
Everybody...
through the glass doors.
Ross got married again-Nooooooo!!!!!!!!!
You're lookin' at it upside down-y'know what? It doesn't matter.
Okay.
On someone's lips? Where'd you get the hickey?
Oh, it's a Macy's bag!
I made the mistake of telling him that I was pregnant.
Oh my God! You look so beautiful!
Oh!
Oh.
Hi you guys!
Are you serious?
Yeah.
I just saw Danny getting on the subway with a girl and he had his arm around her.
Well okay-Well don't ruin it! Just play along at least!
No, wait. No there's gotta be something else that you can do. I mean, what skills do you have?
Good.
You don't.
Oh God, ohh, okay, y'know what, do you think ah, do you think that you just forget that I told you this?
Why, why not?
Oh look, she's pulling away again! Do you think my nipples are too big for her mouth? She looks scared. Doesn't she look scared?
Well, sure! Come in! Well, what-what happened to your girlfriend?
Yeah! His name is um, Mark something.
Yes! She's gonna help us take care of the baby! Woo-hoo.
Oh, wow. Super ass-kissing power.
GIVE ME THE BOOK! Pablo Diaz, Brady Smith, huh, "Guy-in-van"?
Hi! I just wanna--Ahhh!!! Oh my God! Oh my God!
Hey.
Oh, no-no-no, no-no-no, it has become, it has-yeah. Oh no, those were four great dates.
Ya know, in crazy world, that means you're married.
And not one of your coupons for an hour of "Joey Love."
Oh, it's so much more fun with you.
Well, anyway, they make these great novelty cakes, in all different shapes, and if you give them a photo, they'll copy it in icing!
Mia Hamm!
Come on apartment! Come on apartment! Oh! I know queen is high!
But I-But everything is okay. I'm fine!
You idiot!!
Well, I told him I would think about it, but I'm gonna tell him no.
Oh, I can not believe you didn't tell me!
Well, now, wait. Now I'm all freaked out. Come on, you guys will watch it with me.
Okay! So, we'll just stay married.
Oh honey, I'm so proud of you, Min.
No, there's nothing to make up, she's gonna know that I have a key to her office, I've got to get you locked up back the way you were!
God, you have to tell me what happens tomorrow!
Oh b-b-but it is!
Ohh, he's married! Ross is married. I can't-I still can't believe it.
Hey.
Do you wanna play football?
Oh, wait-wait-wait...
You'd be okay if you knew that Mark had kissed me, and been naked with me, and made love to me?
Can you believe what a jerk Ross was being?
Honey that sounds like fun.
Yeah. Hi Mark!
Do you think I'm someone else?
Oh my God.
Right!
Yeah, y'know I-I think I'm just gonna hang out in my room.
Oh my God!
Ooh, I like those sunglasses.
Oh okay, I see what you're doing there.
Yes!
I'm fine, I'm fine.
That is it! You just barge in here, you don't knock
What?!
All right let me see. Uma Thurman, Winona Ryder, Elizabeth Hurely, Michelle Pfieffer, and Dorothy Hammel?
Barbara! Hi, how are you? Uh-huh. No, I understand. Yeah. Oh, oh, come on, no, I'm fine. Don't be silly. Yeah... oh, but you know, if-if anything else opens up, pleaHello? Hello?
Oh but look! That's gonna leave a stain!
Ohh! Thank God! Where was it?
Okay.
Oh... Oh my God. He remembered.
Phoebe, you had a date three days ago.
Oh, it's just like a bloodbath in here today.
Um, everyone?
I am so psyched I kept this chair for myself!
Would you guys stop.
Oh. Oh! I can do it!
Oh! Ross is sooo great!
Why? Honey, what is the big deal?
No! There's no orange juice in there! We win!!
When?! After the birth of our first secret child?! Ross didn't get the annulment; we are still married.
Yeah...
Wait, but there's no money! Well this is terrible! You guys are gonna have to get married in like a, rec. center!
Yeah! That would be great!
You know what I'm going to do? I'm going to get in my sweats, and eat this in bed!
I know. At dusk. That's such a hard time for me.
Oh my God, he dream-cheated on you!
Oh, he's just goofing around.
Okay. Wait! Wait!
Okay.
Hi.
For Ross, Ross, Ross.
Yes, Joey, I remember, she's annoying, but you know what she's-she's his girlfriend now. I mean what can we do?
So. I just thought the two of us should hang out for a bit. I mean, you know, we've never really talked. I guess you'd know that, being one of the two of us, though, right?
Oh! That's great!
Hi, sweetie!
Hello baby girl.
Yeah? Well, you should know. You've bought like a billion of 'em.
So did you break up with Joanna?
Ohh-ho-hooohhh. The hair comes out, and the gloves come on.
OK, sorry to break up this party, but I've got resumes to fax before work tomorrow...
Just get out! Now!!
You found my book?!
What?!
Good luck to ya!
Tequila!!
But you could teach us.
All right, believe me.If you win the lottery, it's the last you're gonna hear from us!
Say it!
Uuuh!! How about at a Footlocker?
Hey Pheebs, I'm-I'm taking Charlie shopping, why don't you come and I'll help you find something.
What d'you want?
Where are you going?
Ross, didn't you say that there was an elevator in here?
It's good. Except he makes us watch the Discovery Channel all day long. Did you know that something really boring happened to someone really ugly in the Middle Ages? Oh, thank you. I'll see you guys later.
Oh.
Whoa! I can't believe you did that. That was really sweet.
Why, does she have a bad personality?
Yes! And I know what looks sexy on guys. Please, just wear what I suggest, and she's gonna go nuts for you.
Yeah and I'm a horrible, horrible person.
Wait, wait, Chandler, this is what you're havin' for Thanksgiving dinner? What, what, what is it with you and this holiday?
This is Bonnie? This is Bonnie? You're Bonnie?
Yes.
What is the matter with you?!
C'mon touch it.
No, I will. I'm just not up for it tonight.
Oh yeah. There is a plan! Why don't I just start taking my smart pills now?
What?!
What?
Nothing, I mean, um, it is your first time with her and, you know if the first time doesn't go well, well then that's, that's pretty darn hard to recover from.
Oh, they're firemen guys.
Oh! Oh!
Well, what are you guys doing tomorrow night?
Wha!? What!? Come on! I found the hardware store all by myself!
Oh-hooo, I missed you.
All right, well that's good to know. Good night, Steve.
Ohh.
Y'know what? I think we can just leave it at that. It's kinda like a symbolic gesture...
Terry, I, I, I know that I haven't worked here very long, but I was wondering, do you think it would be possible if I got a $100 advance in my salary?
Ok. You decorate dad's office and so now you're a decorator. Okay! I went to the zoo yesterday and now I'm a koala bear.
What?!
Hi!
Ah!
What?! Wait! What are you talking about?! You love their Kung Pao Chicken!
Yes oh--Do I want sugar in my coffee? No, just some milk would be good Carol. Thanks. Okay, do you remember all that stuff I taught you yesterday?
No it's not!
Ugh! So close!
All right. Well, if I gonna do this, I'd better keep going.
Oh god. You've totally messed with the back support of my chair. How do you fix this?
Oh, I....
"Ooo," what?
Oh, well thank you for taking your tongue out of my sister's mouth long enough to tell me that.
Hey! Hey, Pheebs, check it out. Yeah, for my desert, I have chosen to make a traditional English truffle!
Well um, I don't.
Ok, good-bye you guys. Thanks for everything. Oh, sorry! Oh, sorry!
Oh sorry, hold on. Let me just check on the baby!
How would you feel about taking out my assistant Tag? I'll pay.
Now, does it really matter?
I think I'm gonna take off.
What?
Hey!
Well, actually Gunther sent me. You're not allowed to have cups out here, it's a thing.
All right, now don't judge me. I normally wait until my date leaves, but you live here. I'm ripping into this swan.
Oh Phoebe, we forgot that party we have to go to.
Where did you get that?
Well, does a good student drink seven beers during his first lesson?
They made you head of the department!
Yeah, uh you-you probably need that for stamps, right?
Oh.
Oh, big glamour night. Me and Monica at Laundorama.
What?!
Because you're not finished yet and I won't have it! Greens do not quit!
Well, we're not seeing each other, so....
Yes I do, it's just that Ross is. . .
Ooh, good God, they're so yummy!
Oh! Yay! Look! There's a piece that doesn't have floor on it!
Joey, you can't keep this to yourself, if you know about this, you have to tell him.
Um... Ross?
Well, so what does he do?
Eh! Stop it!
Look, I'm fine. Watch. Look at that. Whoa-whoa!
Oh, honey, that's so sweet.
Awww...
So you eh, you talked to Joey?
Okay. Uh, well can we, can we get you anything Mr. Zelner? Maybe some chocolates?
Oh no, I'm sorry, you look a lot different from the last time I-I saw you.
Rachel.
Ok, you know what, I'm just gonna take her outside.
Y'know, it was, uh.. it was actually really great. He took me to lunch at the Russian Tea Room, and I had that chicken, where y'know you poke it and all the butter squirts out...
Hmm. Look, Ross, if you want your neighbors to like you, why don't you just pay the hundred bucks? The party's gonna cost you way more than that.
No, that was his costume. See, he's actually an orthodontist, but he came as a regular dentist.
I know, I know, and you were right Ross. You are soo irresponsible I am never letting you baby-sit ever again!
Ooh, I just feel bad, I never vacuum.
Ross, look, I know that some of this stuff is out there, but I mean, come on, look at this, look at this sweater! . I mean, this is just beautiful!
Ugh!
Yeah, we could. Oh hey look! There's some Kappa Kappa Deltas! I was a Kappa. Hey sisters! Wow, we really are bitches.
I think it is.
What? Wait-wait a minute, what? Phoebe, what's the matter?
Huh. Except, Phoebe's not gonna be the one that gets to dress them.
At his apartment. Is this juice?
Hey, what do you think is a better excuse for why I'm not drinking on this date tonight. "Umm, I'm a recovering alcoholic. I'm a Mormon," or "I got so hammered last night I'm still a little drunk?"
Ok.
Okay great, hold on a sec! Oh, here you go! You don't mind do ya? That would really help me out a lot! Thanks!
Anyway, Ralph just came in to tell me that he's so happy with my work that he wants me to be the new merchandising manager for polo retail.
Oww!
And a nice hot cider for Monica.
Bye.
Oh, you guys, I can't believe this. But I'll leave now, or I'm gonna miss my plane.
All right are you guys gonna come down?
Oh, I gotta go back in there.
Oh yeah, really? Is it Ross? Yeah? Okay, well let me make this a just a little bit easier for you.
What?
Remember when we went to Central Park and rented boats?.. That was fun.
Oh my god. Ok you guys, there's Danny. Watch. Just watch this. See?! Still pretending he's not interested. Ohh, he's coming over. Just pretend like we don't know him. We've forgotten who he is.
What?!
Yeah, I-I-I just pulled the tab and I just fogged his yeti ass!
And your lap does not count! Okay? Come on help me move this.
I don't know. He was cute, and he liked me. It was an impulse.
I wanna see it.
Ok. See you, bye.
Then what's with all the bananas?
No-no-no! No-no-no! Please Ross, I can't! I can't do it! It's just gonna freak me out!!!
Oh, y'know I'm not that much of a sweet tooth. I--Wow. My God, so creamy. Oh my God, this is the best cheesecake I have ever had. Where did you get this?
Please? YES! Sandy you're hired.
Thank you. Hello? I still don't get it.
...and then they came back from smoking and they had made all of the decisions without me!
Yeah, it sure is!
Impressive.
Hey, do you believe this? Do you believe they are actually getting married?
Dr. Wiener.
Hey Mona!
Well honey, what about you?
Oh! Oh by the way?
Oh, hi!
Since when do you watch the news?
Make love? What are you a girl?
How do you know about that?
Oh that's right! I'm sorry! I-I am early! Finish! Please!!
No, I don't want to tell you.
What?!
How could you not tell me you worked here?
I knew it! I knew it. Come on tell me your moves.
All right, y'know what? If you don't want to believe me about this, why don't you just come with me to dinner tonight and she will tell you.
Well, I kind of... I kind of lost him.
Please, make sure she comes. It's really important to me, I mean it's my mom!
Yeah Pheebs, honey, she just got engaged a couple of hours ago. I doubt she's even had time to...
Joey?!
Hey! You...can't...leave Joey! You agreed to buy that boat, all right?! That is a contract! And plus if you leave, my boss is gonna kill me!
No! No, she's-She was nice. I mean, she's a little slutty, but who isn't?
Sure? Thanks.
Honey, this will help.
Wh--Why don't I tell you over here?
Come on! They rushed into this thing so fast it's ridiculous! I mean, they're gonna be engaged for like what? A year? And somewhere along the way, one of them is gonna realise what they've done and they're call the whole thing off. I'm telling ya, you're gonna be dancing at my wedding before you're dancing at there's.
Hey! Hi!
Yes!
What? You really think she's hot?
Hi, sweetie.
Oops sorry, my mistake.
Hi.
Hi.
No because first they arrest the guy and then they try him.
...we went back the house and we got really silly and we...we made out.
No. Not-not for me, but why don't you take off your sweater?
That's shocking!
Yeah.
But I...
Yeah, you bet.
Wow! I can't believe that's our baby.
Oh Monica, we are so sorry.
Well y'know, some people make deals with a friend, like if neither of them are married by the time they're 40, they marry each other.
Come on, it's a hypnosis tape. This woman at work used it for two weeks straight and she hasn't smoked since.
Oh.
Honey.
Let us keep the apartment and...
No.
And?
Ok, we can do this now, can't we Ben? Yes we can, yes we can. There. I did it. I did it. Look at that, oh, stays on and everything. Hi.
You what?
Look! I cleaned! I did the windows, I did the floors... I even used all the attachments on the vacuum, except that little round one with the bristles, I don't know what that's for.
Very good.
Joey has got a secret peephole!
Oh, wait before you guys go, can I just ask you a question?
There you go!
No. I...
Well...did you know he was gonna ask me?
Thank you. I...yeah.
And I will make everyone call me Mrs. Geller!
What did you get her?
Thank God. Food.
Oh yay!
Alright, don't tell me, don't tell me! Decaf cappucino for Joey.. Coffee black.. Late.. And an iced tea. I'm getting pretty good at this!
Hardy Boy.
None for me.
Thanks for dinner.
Oh, what do you, you want me to stop seeing him, is that what you want?
Thank you.
Oh!
That's it? Well I saw that! Ohh-ohh-oh, thank you.
Yeah, you like that baby? May we help you?
Hey, did you guys check out those new hand-dryers in the bathroom?
Sure! God, please take those off!
Oh, Joey, it's so great to be back here. I gotta tell you, you're making it so easy on me and Emma.
Oh yeah.
Bye-bye-e!
Oh my God! What happened?
So bad.
Ohh!
Well, why shouldn't I be? I have great friends! I have a wonderful job!
Oh well, you don't want to do that now?!
Noo.
Yeah.
Okay.
Okay.
Oh! Well let's look for them. Oh-oh-hey! Are these them?
What? What? Ross, you're scaring me. What's going on?
No, really. Really, Pheebs, you're not gonna be the one worrying about saving for college, or yelling at them when they're bad, y'know, or deciding to put them on Ritalin when they just won't calm down. Y'know?
Hey, Monica!
What's up Joey?
Y'know what? I don't, I don't think Phoebe really wants to come.
Why?
Now Joey remember, if you win you have to hug me! You hug me!
Oh thank you! Oh God! Can I have another one?
I'm not jealous. All right this is about, umm, people feeling certain things y'know about strippers. And y'know, and um, I...
Just think, in a couple of years we get to turn into them.
Oh, right. Sorry. But Tag's not coming; his girlfriend came into town, so he's spending Thanksgiving with her.
Oh my God Ross! What in heaven's name are you doing here?
Yeah, right. Sure!
OK Julie, so now let's start with your childhood, what was that like?
Oh my God! What if he thinks I'm the kind of girl that-that would just sleep with him?
Hey!
Ross? All this time? Well, I've got to talk to him.
So-so, you missed a message from who? Chandler or your mom? Or Chandler? Or your mom?
Ohh, I love Joey! Joey lives with a duck!
Yeah, I can't live with Joey once the baby comes. I don't want my child's first words to be, "How you doin'?"
Wow, he's cute, Pheebs! But I thought you just started dating that Kindergarten teacher.
Mm-mmm.
No, you wait! This is ridiculous!
I'm not here! That's just my Chinese food!
Alright, okay, okay, gleba, gleba... Gleba! Ha! Here it is: the fleshy, spore-bearing inner mass of a certain fungi.
You seem to really like her.
But I...
Okay, just sweep it.
Thank you. Hey-hey umm, uh, is there, is there any such thing as an annulment shower?
Good luck Chandler.
You're all gonna be aunts and uncles.
Ohh, I would love too.
Oh yes! Thank you!
Oh, oh, and hey-hey-hey, those little spelling tips will come in handy when you're at home on Saturday nights playing Scrabble with Monica!!
Y'know if what I do is so lame, then why did you insist on coming with me this morning? Huh? Was it so I just wouldn't go with Mark?
Ross, those things go like 40 miles an hour! Ok? When you're... and there is that moment when you are at the top, when you just don't know if you're gonna return back to earth!
Ross, you got that for free from the museum gift shop.
Okay. Okay, see? I get the phone.
Okay. Okay fine, y'know what? We will let Ross and Joey decide. Hiiiii, Ross! Sweetie.
He offered me one.
Wow! How are you?!
Hi.
I think she's checking out your beehive Ross.
This is ridiculous! I...
Yay!
Somebody got in late last night.
Am I going to let you watch me undress?
That's a good call. Right.
Right.
You fell asleep?!
Well that-y'know it's just uh, I've never done that before. Me and him alone.
It's open! Hi, Joe!
Basketball!
Oh no! My new Paolo shoes!
You like me?
Joey, do you have a minute?
All right, fine. Um, you were not the only one there. Joey was there too.
Awww, stop. Come on. Now go shave that head!
Guess what. Ben just said his first word.
So did I. I'm really glad Monica asked us out.
Ok, I, I hear what you're sayin'. I'm with you. Um, but I, but I'm trying really hard. And I think I'm doing better. I really do. Does anybody need coffee? Oh, look at that.
Oh?
Yes, I know that. I know that. And I know that hiring him was probably not the smartest thing that I've ever done. But I'm telling you, from this moment on I swear this is strictly professional. Yes?
Aww Pheebs, that sucks!
Yeah, I do. I think you should go, by yourself, get some distance, clear your head, I think it'd be really good.
No! Joey please! Please don't! Please don't leave like this! Now come on, you cannot do this to a pregnant woman!
Nope!
Okay, even this is turning me on!
Ross, you don't know that.
Are you joking? Check out is not 'til noon and he has a good eleven minutes left.
Hey Ross! I brought reinforcements.
Look, I cannot do this right now, okay, I've got a deadline, would you just go home, I'll talk to you later.
I am not gonna get fired, because I'm not gonna act on it.
No really, she didn't sleep well last night, so we can't wake her up.
All right, I'm outta here!
We hate that guy.
No, so I don't have to get married until I'm 33! That's three years, that's three whole years-Oh, wait a minute though. I'll need a year and a half to plan the wedding, and I'd like to know the guy for a year, year and a half before we get engaged... Which means I need to meet the guy by the time I'm thirty.
Hi Pheebs!
Hey!
Then why do you ask?!
Oh I don't know honey. It's gonna be really late.
I don't know.
Oh please, they're having sex.
Okay, remember uh, remember how you told me that your grandmother put up that wall to make that into two bedrooms?
I mean I got news for you mister, Emma? Not easy.
Ohhhhhhhh God.
Yeah! You can hook it up to your TV and you get radio!
Oh, I wanna quit, but then I think I should stick it out, then I think why would such a person stay in such a demeaning job, just because it's remotely related to the field they're interested in.
Here comes another contraction.
Well, I don't know about that, but some said that I looked like a floating angel.
Ive never done that.
Wait, what are you doing?
Hi!
Yeah, I love that story. Um, I got a question for you guys. Why do people keep is saying that is good to see me up and about?
Well, uhm... whatever, I have really appreciated it, 'cause I don't think I would be the person that I am today if it wasn't for you guys. See, I wanna help Amy the way you guys helped me. And I know it's gonna take patience, but that's ok.
Hey!
Oh my God! Calling from Rome! Bon giorno, caro mio.
Okay.
Oh, everything went great.
Pheebs, I would make a reservation for five, because one of us has to stay home and watch Emma. Which one of us should go to dinner?
Mon, if uh you were at lunch alone, how come it cost you uh 53 dollars?
You didn't break up with that fireman?
Well why didn't you take the job?
Mon, honey, I gotta ask you something.
Um, there was a Geller Cup?
Bye, Chandler.
You just finished?
Oooh... you're sweet, I knew uncle Joey would step up. Look Emma, look who's baaack!
Ohh, Phoebe, what am I going to do?
I forgot... I am supposed to pick up a friend at the airport. I am so sorry! I'm so... if you want to stay, and finish your drinks, please do.... I meanI'm sorry. I-I-I gotta go. I'm sorry.
You're hurt!
No.
But I told you, I didn't have the time!
Be-because I didn't want him to think I was stupid! I mean, that was really embarrassing what happened to you!
Okay, I heard that.
Me too!
Yeah, I'll be fine. But could someone please make sure that sandwich is gone when I get out there?
Would you let me talk.
Yeah, I did. I needed my lucky dress.
Oh Phoebe!
Ohh, are you setting Ross up with someone? Does she have a wedding dress?
I know Monica's worst Thanksgiving.
We went through a lot of wine tonight, you guys.
Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing?
Wait, we still have time to talk and they're-they're not even in the car yet! Oh look, there they go, okay.
Rob Tillman!
I-I, got a job at Ralph Lauren.
OH! Alright, you know what? That's it! I want my share of the tickets !
Why.
Yeah!
Oh you're not. You're not gonna get in the middle of anything, don't worry about Ross really, really. Oh! Hide! That's Ross! Hide! Hide!
It's Le Poo.
Well, maybe they can find a way to bring you back.
Ross, I swear, I don't know.
Excuse me, can I, can I bum one of those? Y'know what, actually... Okay, okay, okay, what's so funny over here?
That's not Ross!
Oh.
Well, what about Mindy?
Did they mention that I'm rubber and you're glue?
Ahhhh.
Who?
Uh-huh, doing it. Doing it. Phone doing it.
Cat! What'm I saying? Cat!
Ok, that's it! Just give'em to me! I'll split them up!
What?
Hey! Well, I had to give the kid fifty bucks to stop crying.
No, God! Please, let me!
Oh! My hero! What happened?
Uh... I don't know.
Amy, that's what I was supposed to wear today, that's why I hung it on the door.
No. Oh, oh, I guess it would be different if I were- with somebody.
No Joe, no miracle.
I was just going to say that I left my keys.
But! Don't you have to give him his money back?
I am not gonna show you this!
What?!
Oh yeah, I'm jealous. "Oh Gavin, please, please look at my ass". Stop looking at my ass! I mean, I just think you are totally inappropriate, ok? This is a work environment, she's your subordinate.
Okay-okay-okay! So, making things. That sounds like so much fun.
Monica, last Saturday night, what happened on Walker Texas Ranger?
What are you ever gonna use that for?!
Ohh no you don't! You got lighting last time, lighting is mine!
What?
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry, but I need to get off the plane, okay? I need to tell someone that I love love them.
Hi!
All right!
I'm not gonna gooo.
SSSHHHHTTT!!He's asking her a question!!
Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight over and over again, Ross, no, you're, you're, you're making this too hard.
What?!
Hey!
Who's this from?
Oh my ... you think I'm a pushover. Well wait, watch this, you know what? You're not invited to lunch. What do you think of that? I think that's pretty strong, that's what I think. Come on, Monica, let's go to lunch.
You're sister? You're sister's asleep on the couch? Ohhh! I saw her with you on the subway and now she's asleep on the couch!
Honey, I'm sorry.
Shhhhh! Phoebe! All right, look. I have a little thing for him.
I said it's still nap time.
I don't know, I'm not trying to do anything, it's just, we have such a good time when we're together, you know... I mean, aren't you just a... little curious... what that would be like?...
Yeah!
But I don't, hmm... Oh, who approved that order?! Well there is no Mark Robbinson in this office. Get me Mark on the phone!
Oh, thank you for doing that. I just can't deal with this just quite yet.
No we...
Thank you...we're so excited!
Op.
I know that. That's why I was getting married.
All right!
Um, excuse me, everyone. Ah, this is my last night working here, and I ah, just wanted say that I made some really good friends working here, and ah, it's just time to move on. Ah, and no offence to everybody who ah, still works here, you have no idea how good it feels to say that as of this moment I will never have to make coffee again.
Y'know, you-you also could've used uh, lamps and then followed the light.
I did!! I watched! I watched! I watched Monica bang his head against that thing!
That's fine. So Monica, you are now in control of my love life.
I do.
No, it was a stupid bet! We were just playing a game!
Pheebs, I have to ask you...
So, did you shave your legs?
What?! What?! My birthday's not for another month!
Oh God... Okay. Alright. Alright. Okay. Ross, please don't hate me.
Noo! Oh no! No! God no! He should not get back together with her. I know that! You know that! Even Ross knows that! But that still doesn't give us the right to erase his message!
Ewww, ewww, ewww, ewww!
I hope it's still funny when you're in hell.
Hi!
Fine.
I could not have done this without you.
Okay. Hey, what are you thinking? What are you thinking right now?
Joey, why don't you just tell her what happened? It's not your fault.
Yeah.
Ross!
Alright, c'mon! Let's play Twister!
Yeah, she's...
Noo.
mh hmm..
OK, OK.
Ow! Ow! Ow!
What?!
No, these aren't all my suitcases. This one's Paolo's.
I can't. I'm busy. I'm apartment hunting.
Chandler, can you give us a minute?
What?
Joey! The baby is kicking for the first time! Will you please come feel this?!
Joey, you're such an amazing actor! How do you know where Dr. Drake Remoray leaves off and Joey Tribbiani begins?
What?!!
I just, Phoebe, said y'know thought she saw something between you guys.
Yeah.
Whoa, I'm sorry. Excuse me. We had this cart.
Okay! All right, pick a half.
Okay, hold on real quick, hold on a second let me just uh, get a little more comfortable here. Wait, now wait a second, this isn't too revealing is it?
No, I didn't. I wouldn't say I had the keys unless I had the keys, and I obviously didn't have the keys.
Uh, Joey..
OK, gook luck.
uh-huh.
What rumor?
So from that you think you've got me all figured out? Well, you don't! Y'know I-I could have toys for underprivileged kids in here!
Ross did I ever tell you about the time that I went backpacking through Western Europe?
What? Wait, what?
Ok, so Phoebe, now are you gonna call your dad and let him know that his dog is ok?
Yeah.
Ewww. Yeah. Umm. I think I'm gonna stay here.
What is?
Umm, well I would have to say that it's a, it's tragic love story.
Ewwww!!
Everybody, this is Paolo. Paolo, I want you to meet my friends. This is Monica.
Um, what- what would make you think that?
Ok, I will have the uh, side salad.
Yeah.
No, but you know what I mean.
Oh what do you know? Virgin!
At the Copa, Copa Cabana The hottest spot north of Havana. At the Copa, Coo-pa Ca-ban-a, music and fashion were always the passion, at the Copa....
Yes you do. You think of it as your apartment, and I'm just somebody who rents a room.
Does anybody need anything?
Okay.
Oh no! I took one of Ross' bags by mistake, and one of mine is missing.
Really?!
Oh I get it! A...man...duh!
Oh, yeah, check it. Definitely, I want some of that.
Hey-hey, y'know what? I don't care! I'm not ashamed of my book. There's nothing with a woman enjoying a little...erotica. It's just a healthy expression of female sexuality, which by the way, you will never understand.
Joey! Joey, good one!
Yeah, but I don't know why. Look at me, I'm having such a wonderful time!
Bye. What a manipulative bitch.
I'm sorry.
Oh God, I hate my job, I hate it, I hate my job, I hate it.
Oh, c'mon. We'll have, we'll have a big party, and no-one'll know who's with who.
It's just so frustrating! Why doesn't she want my breast?!
Okay.
Hey. Whe-ell, look at you, finally got that time machine workin' huh?
'Cause I don't need your stupid ship.
You sure?
Oh, it's okay.
I'd wait.
I know!
Well, I gotta get up early and it's almost seven o'clock.
Oh!... Oh and Emma, look at your stuffed animals lined up so neatly!
I know but they're just so beautiful! Oh, my God, I just pulled one out.
Monica's making jam.
Okay. Okay.
Well it's not, honey I'm sorry, I guess I'm just nervous. I mean, it's you, ya know, it's us. I mean, we're crossing that line, sort of a big thing.
We really are.
Yes, yes it is true. And I know this because, because he pretended to be Drake to, to sleep with me.
Seriously stop it, or I'm gonna jump on ya.
Alright, alright. Calm down Norma Rae. They didn't actually say that. I'm just afraid if I don't come back right now this guy's gonna try to squeeze me out.
Oh no, no-no-no, that's not, not, not, what he is doing. He's just, he's just really romantic.
Ross...
Oh, just tell us! We're not gonna want it!
Pie in the hood, pie in the hood. Go.
Ugh! Look honey y'know what? I haven't told him yet, so until I do I don't think I should tell anybody else.
Good! 'Cause I've got a product report to read, it's like eight pages, I hope I don't fall asleep.
So you were saying?
Ohhhhh, don't be mad...
Yeah, it's in there.
Oh my gosh. Wow, so beautiful.
I gotta go!
I really think you need to go now.
For every night that you're asleep before I get home from work...
Oh God, even his knock is boring.
So I'm thinking about you. So what?
Oh yeah!
Ross, that girl just spent the entire evening talking to your friends, asking to hear stories about you, looking through Monica's photo albums, I mean you don't do that if you're just in it for two weeks.
Yeah.
Look Ross, if you're so freaked out, just get in the car!
Not Joey, no, I was just lusting after Chandler.
I don't see it!
Oh my God! We are throwing the most depressing baby shower ever!
Yeah.
Uhh, we still need a tip.
Ross, c'mon, please. Can we just get out of here, before somebody else gets hurt?
Okay, Pheebs, y'know what, let's look at this objectively all right? Ninth grade, right? The obsession starts. All right? The summer after ninth grade he sees me in a two-piece for the first time, his obsession begins to grow. So then...
Oh Ross, come on. He's happily married. His wife just had twins.
Bye Mon.
In Human Resources!!!!!!
Okay, wow, wow, wow. Watch the tongue people, we've got a baby over here.
Yeah, just give me a minute! Oh well, yes, I can think of one good thing.
Does anybody need more coffee?
I am not a baby! You know what? I swear to god, just because you get so uptight every time we...
And hey! Just so you know, it's not that common! It doesn't happen to every guy! And it is a big deal!!
I had a bra.
Come on, it's not a big deal! We stayed up all night coming up with a plan so that us dating will not be a problem.
Oh, I gotta get my ticket!
Run Phoebe run.
No, actually I took it off then I drew it back on.
Monica. You've, you've done it right?
I do the same thing.
Oh, The Velveteen Rabbit! Oh my God, when the boy's love makes the rabbit real!
It's the woman from the hospital admissions office. She says there's a problem with the form. Oh, god, oh god...
: Step away from the crib, I have a weapon!
No. Uch.
Good bye!
Can I?
Have you ever had any weird romantic dreams?
I know, but I was just thinking about how huge this is for me. I didn't even go to how huge this was going to be for the father.
This is Chandler.
Oh, I'm sorry I spoiled you're evening.
Oh, wow! Congratulations, that's quite a waste of time.
Oh my god.
Ok, uh, Billy Dreskin, Pete Carney, Barry, and uh, oh, Paolo.
Hi, I thought you might like some ice chips.
Look! This is ridiculous. We should be packing you!!
What handsome is not your type? Smart? Kind? Good kisser? What those things aren't on your list? Ross is a great guy! You would be lucky to be with him!
Really! What is with that guy? I mean you'd forgive me if I fogged you.
Honey, maybe we should take you to a doctor.
What?!
You know what? I don't want to be with them either, but it's Thanksgiving and we should not want to be together, together.
Well, I...
Hi! Oh you guys look so beautiful!
Well forget it, I'm not telling that girl anything. That is not my responsibility.
Ohh Tag, umm...you're such a great guy and we have sooo much fun together but I don't-I don't...
All right, come on, let's go get your coat.
I don't know. We were watching TV, and then he pooped in Monica's shoe-
Hit me!
Yeah! If you don't I will! Of course your body's gonna change. Your breasts are gonna get bigger, your ass is gonna get bigger, you're gonna lose bladder control. God! It's just such a magical time!
Ah!
Ross!
Yes you do, if you're going to make me feel guilty for getting a free massage!
Oh, I have to go pee. Apparently this baby thinks that my bladder is a squeeze toy.
Hello.
Wait, what am I gonna do?
And you've got lenses! But you hate sticking your finger in your eye!
Oh, she's coming up! She's coming up!
Hi! Hey, Happy Valentine's Day!
Monica and Chandler are really moving in here and I have to move out and everything is changing.
Hey!
Oh tomorrow, oh I don't know. Um...
BACK OFF!!! Get up! Get up! Get up! God damn it! Get up, get up, get up, get up, get up!!
Right back at ya!
No! No! No! No it's not! No it's not! Come on! Phoebe, ours is totally different! I mean we don't have the... We don't have the...that lamp! And-and that screen is y'know, on the other side.
And you're still not attracted to him at all?
Yeah.
Hey! What's up Mon?
Down at the docks again?
Ughhhh!! Forget it! This is, this is not how this is supposed to happen.
Daddy.
We didn't change..
Wow!
I did.
Oh yeah.
Okay, you are crazy! I'm sorry, but she sounded generally upset! I mean, listen!
Look, Charlie, I just want you to know. Ross is just having a little trouble adjusting to the thought of Joey and me. You know, he normally doesn't drink like this.
No.
Oh my God! How long has she been crying?
Ohh that'd be great!
Oh, it's just an anti-theft device.
Oh my goodness, she had the smoothest skin! I mean when I stuck that dollar bill in her g-string and grazed her thigh...
It's gonna be up all night!
Chandler, that's not enough. I mean what if she gets you a great present, two medium presents, and a bunch of little presents? And you've just gotten her one great present? I mean that's just gonna make her feel bad. Why would you do that to her Chandler? Why? Why?
Oh, well, it pretty much sucked. How was yours?
I am not horsing around okay? I am Porsching around.
I hope it's okay.
What? What's what you were afraid of?
Ok, I, I will do your laundry for one month.
Shh!
You're gonna be late! Go! Go!
Mrs. Bing, I have to tell you, I've read everything you've ever written. No, I mean it! I mean, when I read Euphoria at Midnight, all I wanted to do was become a writer.
Hey, you know, before you said that nothing could happen between us? What changed?
By all means.
Hi! Hi Ben!
Well, uh...
What? Who?
I know, I know, so it is just not a big deal.
Bye!
Hi, Pheebs? Okay, so just spoke to the nurse and the reason that your doctor is late is because uh, she's not coming.
Oh Phoebe, I'm so happy for you honey.
Monica, what is with you? Who'd you have lunch with?
Ooh! Oh wow this is so beautiful.
Hi! Well, we were just about to take off and see a movie. Oh no!
Oh, well, you are so cute! I wish I could play with you more, but I've got to go to work! I hope I stop talking like this before my marketing meeting, yes I do. Yes I do. Bye-bye, Joey. Oh, I seriously can't stop it.
Oh no!!!! Oh my God!! This is all making so much sense to me now! This is why Adam Carter wouldn't go out with me! This is why Billy Tratt would just stay in this region!
Chandler!
Okay, very cute braces. Anyway y'know what, the point is Tag, start looking because you are going to find those contracts on your desk.
No, I don't think we'll be doing that.
Only like a month!
Wait! No, that's ridiculous. Come on, he lives three blocks away!
Well, Chandler said that it's really important to him too!
Hey, Mon.
Oh good.
Joey asked me marry him.
Sure...
Okay, y'know, would you feel better if we went someplace else? I mean we could pack all this stuff up and y'know go to your apartment.
What?!
I didn't see anything! I actually changed my mind about the name.
Oh, yeah, I'm sorry. They used to live here; sometimes they migrate back over.
No. I have got to get ready and go to a dinner at my bosses house. It's a very big deal, there's a lot of people there I have to meet.
Honey, I don't know how to tell you this, but um, if something were to happen to Ross or to myself um you wouldn't get the baby.
Oh, ju-ju-just stay calm. Just be calm. For all he knows we're just hanging out together. Right? Just be nonchalant. That's not nonchalant!
You know what? Uhm, I have some goodbye stuff that I wanted to say to each of you and I was gonna save it until the end of the night, but come here .
Okay.
Okay come on Phoebe, it's nothing! Monica, come on!
Ross I'm so sorry. Okay. I-I will promise I will straighten this out with him tomorrow in person, or via e-mail.
Uh, I don't have any brothers so I don't know, but uh, did you guys wrestle?
You may need to use this year to teach Ben about Phoebe.
All right.
I know I told you, it's a really big problem.
How did it go with Erin?
I love him. He's so pretty I wanna cry! I don't know what to do. Tell me what to do.
All right, let's get this party started, huh? Joey and Phoebe are gonna perform a little something for us.
Yeah! You and that girl from that copy place, which yesterday you took full responsibility for!!
I know, I can do more than cook.
Actually, y'know that's not the Thanksgiving I was talking about.
Oops, sorry. Listen, we-we have to have a party tonight! Actually, we have to have one in five minutes, so everybody cancel your plans.
That's my bubby!
I got it!
Really?
Oh wow, eight hours? So you could probably really use one of those plug-in telephone headsets huh?
What's up, Ross?
Calm ourselves?
Oh! Phoebe, all babies are beautiful!
Umm, I said I thought you were a good kisser, and uh, and that I like your tiney-tiny touchie.
I'm just sort of in the middle of something.
Joey, you are not! You're 31.
Hi!
No, no-no, it's okay, calm down. Mark and I talked, and I realised how much I love your stupid brother, and, yeah, we got our problems, but I really want to make it work.
Yeah, yeah sure! Yeah!
As I was saying... I should probably have the first of the three kids by the time I'm 35 which gives me five years. I love this plan! I wanna marry this plan!
No. Okay. I was at the airport, getting into a cab, when this woman- this blonde planet with a pocketbook- starts yelling at me. Something about how it was her cab first. And then the next thing I know she just starts- starts pulling me out by my hair! So I'm blowing my attack whistle thingy and three more cabs show up, and as I'm going to get into a cab she tackles me. And I hit my head on the kerb and cut my lip on my whistle...oh...everybody having fun at the party? Are people eating my dip?
Would you stop?! What is the matter with you?!
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh God.
Okay.
Okay.
I am? Oh, look at that, yes I am. Enough about me, enough about me, Mr. Back from the Orient. Come on. I wanna hear everything! Everything.
Has anybody seen my engagement ring?
I love working with designers!
Oh my God! Oh my God!!
So.
Awe! Oh my God! Looks, she's a little dare-devil! Oh, let me push, can I push?
Aww, Joey, come here. Look honey, I know this must be really, really difficult for you and I--Oh, I'm sorry. Am I hurting you?
So now, what exactly is the point of the box?
Uh-hmm. I'm just thinking about Phoebe; poor knocked up Phoebe.
Yeah! I am soo gonna marry that guy. Ohhh!
Well, look at that, same thing.
I'm sorry, let her?
Yeah, I didn't want you to get hit by the boom!
Ben, its Rachel! But whatever.
Okay, a couple months late on the lecture, Ross.
Huh. Wow, I wouldn't think Hobbs would like that so much.
Hi! Emma will be up in a minute!
Oh yeah, I totally agree.
Really?
Well then he gets a divorce, it's Ross!
Hi. Umm, I think there's something that we really need to talk about.
Because it's embarrassing.
Phoebe, what the hell are you talking about? Other than their names being similar, I'm sorry, I do not see what you're seeing.
What?
Yeah, Rachel. And this is Ross' sister, Monica. We met at Thanksgiving. .
Yeah, it couldn't hurt to look.
Hey, you.
And Joey....
No, you're not an idiot, Ross. You're a guy very much in love.
Oh well, hello. This is your lucky day Mr. Bowmont, the uh gentleman day sailer as just become available again and I believe that you made a bid of $18,000.
What? Really?
yeah-yeah-yeah!!
Oh, y-yeah, so, you-you love me!
Okay. Great! So now that you guys all know you can help me. Give me some advice on how I'm gonna tell Ross!
Huh. Well, then you'd better keep it away from Ross's hair. So this is pretty rare. How did you get that?
Chandler! Chandler, please, I have to get you locked up back the way you were, I am sooo gonna lose my job, she's very private about her office. Now I know why.
Oh wow! That deserves another piece of candy.
Oh good.
I meant er, young, young, I meant young, young to be a doctor. Oh good, Rach.
Oh er... well you know Emma started crawling? I realised that this place, is very unsafe for a baby. So I went to the store and got some stuff to baby-proof the apartment.
Oh, yeah, right.
Ohhh!
Well, hey! How about right above the TV? . That way, it will be the first thing that you see when you walk in the door!
Ok.
Eight weeks. I mean I love my mother, but my God, a long lunch with her is taxing.
Rosss...
Well, last night you seemed to know your way around the table.
I can not believe your trading me!!
Well, isnt, isnt that gonna be weird?
Oh, oh Ross, oh my God, are you okay?
He offered me one.
Hi!
whhh wait, you're gonna leave my party to take care of a box of rats?
Then what? What do you want?
Okay, maybe they are not funny to you...
Whoa! What?! Why?!
Love you too... Alright, I'm going to bed.
Ah! Well it was Joey reading Drake's lines in the dream...
Okay, it's just-and this is really embarrassing-but lately with this whole pregnancy thing I'm just finding myself...how do I put this umm, erotically charged.
I'm sorry, no.
Sick-sick-sick-sick.
That's not her name! I'm sorry, she just doesn't feel like an Isabella.
Central Perk is proud to present Miss Phoebe Buffay.
Monica, this is Dan , one of the guys that we're gonna be going out with on Saturday. Uh Dan, Monica.
Oh God. I'm sorry about this.
So who's idea was it to put everybody in the diner on skates?
Oh no.
I'm great! I'm great. I've got a great job at Bloomingdale's, have wonderful friends, and eventhough I'm not seeing anyone right now, I've never felt better about myself.
Thank you, thank you, thank you, Pheebs.
Okay, come on-Joey, I'll buy you a new one! All right? We'll go down to the store right now and we'll-we'll get you a new chair.
What?!
Yeah.
So. Ross, I've bugged him about this a million times, he's not gonna change.
She's mine!
Oh, thank God you're here! You have to help me! Were you just talking to yourself?
Mmm hmm.
Yeah, and none of these stupid grocery questions, real personal questions.
Yeah, so what is she, like a... like a spokesmodel, or an aerobics instructor, what?
Thank you.
Ohh!
What?
Hi! All right, let's go shoppin'!!
Yeah, they said he's gonna be fine, but he's still heavily sedated.
Well, what is a boss for? Hug it out!
Yeah, I got that.
Oh yeah, it's fine, it's fine. Sandy was just... was just telling me about how he proposed to his fiance and it was just sooo beautiful.
From now?
Really?
Oh-oh-oh, he's a transponce-transpondster!
Oh, Ross, relax. It's probably like two dollars for the first contraction, and then fifty cents for each additional contraction.
Oh-oh-oh, he's a transponce-transpondster!
Okay, you guys, just relax. I doooo.
Full, dry, on its back, and no loose covers.
What? Oh my God! To who?
No-no-don't! Don't leave me here with these people.
Hi. Ohhh, you got my message.
No honey, we're sorry, we didn't mean it. I love you. I love you.
What? It's true, my right leg is two inches shorter.
Really.
I don't know! I think it's kind of serious! Oh, you know... I was watching this thing on TV this morning about... Newcastle disease... and I think I might have it!!
She won a thousand dollars!
Hey-whoa-whoa-whoa!! Ho-ho-hold on a sec there, Mr. Kissey! Y'know, I've been meaning to talk to you about this whole, little, new European thing you got going on, and I just need to tell you that it makes me very uncomfortable and I just-y'know-stop it!
Aww. Well, ok, well that's very nice. And you wrote a card . "From Gavin"
Well, y'know I-I don't know where he is.
What?! Joey, you don't want to go on a date with a pregnant lady.
Okay then!
Oh! I do not have chubby ankles!
Why would you even want to come Ross? You're a horrible skier.
Oh, hey, don't you have to go pick up Emily?
Yeah, right away Mr. Kaplan.
Yeah and you stretch 'em out with your big old clown feet.
Well, from me. And I know it's not your big money song, but it's my favorite.
Y'know, you should never be allowed to talk to people!
Listen y'know what sir? For the last time, I don't care what the computer says, we did not take a bag of Mashuga nuts from the mini-bar and we did not watch Dr. Do-Me-A-Little!
Oh, hi!
Oh-ohh, thank you.
I don't know... I mean, I've never looked at you that way before.
Well I'll tell ya! See uh my-my boss and his wife-They-they can't have children. So umm, and that-we were at the Christmas party, and he got drunk, and he said to me, "Rachel, I want to buy your baby."
What?! You say that to kids?!!
Okay mommy, don't ever leave me.
Rock-paper-scissors?
Oh God, I really had a good time!
Why?
Yeah! Oh, umm when-when Monica and Chandler got engaged I started putting some stuff together, y'know just in case...
Yeah! But I don't know what he looks like!
Oh! Ow!
What you got there? Something else that's not yours that you can break?
Ohh, I just don't think I have enough left on my credit card.
Well that is because your eye immediately goes to the big naked man.
Obviously you know how to haggle, so I'm not gonna try and take you on. Okay? So $800 and I don't call the cops because you're robbing me blind! Blind! Just take cat, leave the money, and run away! Run away! Damnit! Cat, can't you at least smile or something?! Okay, did anybody just hear that? Anybody?
Someone? I brought people. Mr. Thompson, this is Phoebe. Phoebe, this is Mr. Thompson. He's the head of my department.
Okay. Well be careful with her, she's really tiny.
Op! Wait, you dropped a pea.
Yeah?
Well, can I talk to you for a sec?
Joey.
I'm sorry your wife is gay. I guess women aren't that great either.
Oh, you bet.
Yeah.
Oh! Oh! Oh my God! Ohhh, ohhh, wow, that ear and nose hair trimmer I got him was just money down the drain, huh?
What?
Yeah, and Lennart Haze is starring in it.
Let me, let me get you some wine!
Hi, uh, nothing. That horrible woman just took my machine.
Isn't that a line from the show?!
He is so cute!
Oh Phoebe!
Me?!
What are you reading?
Yeah. And y'know who should've shut their drapes? Is that perverted old couple two doors over.
Yeah, maybe.
You know what, we just say that she said it was 5 o'clock. We'll just act casual. We're not late, we're right on time.
Oh, god, I know it, that I freaked you out.
Ugh, okay, well somebody will come and save us.
What's that?
Hmm, mild discomfort. So I take it you've had one of these Braxton thingies?
Well, well, well, hop back in bucko, cause I got four sixes! I won! I actually won! Oh my God! Y'know what? I think I'm gonna make a little Ross pile. I think that one was Ross's, and I thinkohthat one was Ross's. Yes! : Well, I have got your money, and you'll never see it...
Phoebe!
Even when we were having sex in that chair?
Are you sure?
Yeah, maybe if you gave this girl a chance it would go somewhere.
Oh, I know. Look at him.
Phoebe, honey, wanna get some breakfast?
Oh my God! You guys this is so great! I mean it's so unexpected! I mean Chandler's birthday is even before mine!
Mr. Treeger.
... yeah, it's true.
I'm more than okay, I am really, really happy! Wanna know why?
Yes! Thank you.
You.
Yeah?
Well, how did you find out?
Yeah?
Ross gave it to me.
Ohh please don't be from a real dinosaur! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Made in Mexico! Yes!! Ugh, who would buy this?!
Oh my God this is sooo humiliating. I think the only thing that tops that was, was, was when I was in the eight grade and I had to sing the Copa Cabana in front of the entire school. I think I got about two lines into it before I ran and freaked out. Oh my God, my entire life is flashing before my eyes.
Okay, I thought it was about your neighbors liking you.
Well-well a little blind sided but y'know good.
Gone! I mean its amazing Pheebs. I feel so free and so graceful. Hey! Look out for the horse! Sorry!
Really?!
Okay.
And that's I'm so glad... there's no problem.
Hi!
You took the same class twice.
Ughh!
And um, excuse me, he helps me.
What?! My mom's not gonna be here?!
You're Joey!
And I'm in it? Then let me read it.
Okay. Ooh, my! Woah! Why is that baby torturing that woman?!
Ohh, that is soo sad.
This is the worst date ever. How could you set me up with this creep?
All right. So you're telling me that there is nothing going on between you and Chandler.
I don't know, his uh, his hair never really bothered me that much, and y'know it was always more crunchy than it was greasy.
Nobody.
The whole night was horrible, it was pouring down rain, and when I got there, there was no Rachel Green on the list, but there was a Rachel Greep.
Not stupid. The very cute, cute, cute doctors asked us out for tomorrow night, and I said "yes."
Yeah, at the lecture, I told you that last week, you said you didn't mind.
So I was with Joshua for an hour today, and he has not asked me out. It's just so frustrating!
Huh. A moo-point?
Oh! I remember laughing! I laughed a lot.
Look, I know that you guys really want to get to Vermont and this isn't a really big deal to you, but it really is to us, ok? Emma will never have a first birthday again.
Joey, I can't do that!
Yeah that's actually a pretty good idea.
What?
Sagittarius?
I'm telling you guys, we followed them out to a house in Westchester, the went in for like forty-five minutes and then they came out looking pretty happy!
I'm training to be better at a job that I hate, my life officially sucks.
I almost caught that one!
Does it hurt?
Wh-what's that?
Yeah, sure...
uh huh.
Shut up that was my friend Melissa from college.
Hi! I'm gal pal Rachel Green, and if you want the dirt, I'm the one you come too. This might be Joey's baby , who knows? I'm just kidding-Seriously, gal pal Rachel Green.
Oh, I think I saw some in here.
Alright fine. I'll do it.
We... We are not... ...going to let it... be a problem.
That's it. Ow!!!
Hi, I'm sorry I'm late but I am ready, ready to talk you up! When does Liz's father get here?
Well no, I don't smell anything.
Well, y'know, possibly. You didn't tell him that, though? Right?
What? You didn't get one.
What?
Yes.
Alright-y then.
Well, I'm very impressed.
It's left sweetie, but that's okay sweetie, that's a tough one.
What.
Yes, they will! You know what you should do? Just go take a walk, all right? I know your size and I'm... I'm gonna pick up some really good stuff for you.
Yeah. That's me!
Don't look at me I never get his jokes.
I also said number one.
Okay. Thank you. That's great. Thank you. Wait-wait! Where on west 10th? Because there's this really cute shoe store that has like this little...
Oh my God, I'm starting to look like my great aunt, Muriel.
I can't believe you would say that!
All right, you know what? I am not leaving here, until you call that plane back!!
Shut up.
Noooooo!!
Hi. Well hey, you don't - you don't think they're kind of cool?
Noooo.
Okay, well then how about a handshake? Oh God I'm sorry! Oh God, I'm sorry! I did not mean to touch that-I mean you there. There. Uhh, okay, so thank-thank you, I'm going to leave now thank you very much uh-huh, thank you so-Hey! I'll see you Monday!
Oh hey-hey wait! How do we fairly decide who gets the phone?
No! I'm sorry, honey, it's just that last week I got all but three answers and I really want to finish a whole one without any help.
Uh-hmm, uh-hmm, yeah, yeah, I really liked your hands.
Well, you've been here for two months now and your boss is required to hand in a performance evaluation. But y'know, there is one thing that I have yet to evaluate.
He even offered to meet me for lunch tomorrow to prep me for it.
No Joey, look. Trust me, all the men are wearing them in the spring catalog. Look. See look, men, carrying the bag.
And a crappy New Year.
I'm not saying that I'm a lesbian! I'm just saying that this happened!
Well, she-she ob-obviously saw the tire tracks that were leading up to the closed garage.
No-no, that wasn't me! Well, we should get started. Let me show you my underwear. The selection of underwear we carry.
Alright! Don't get too comfortable there, because I'm back in two weeks! And I want everything back to the way it was. I can't say that I care too much for the way you've rearranged my office.
Y'know when I locked myself in the bathroom at my wedding, it was because I was trying to pop the window out of the frame.
Done.
She has got so much going on we-we have only two options. We have Friday...
Yes, you did! And don't you say, "No, I didn't!"
Just a bug.
Hi!
Oh, God, ask them what they want.
Hey.
Oh!
Hm-mm.
I... Am I the only one that this is embarrassing for?
'Kay.
Well, you would know.
Ew! Gross.
Hey you guys... You're never gonna believe it. This headhunter called me. I have a meeting tomorrow with Gucci. Gucci wants me.
Well it happened about six weeks ago, and uh I had just got home from work and Ross was already there 'cause I guess he had been hanging out with Joey.
Joey, where did you learn that word?
Daddy, daddy, you know what, I really wanna hear more about this, I really do, but I just have, I just have to do a, some stuff.
You can't just say, 'Nice to meet you, good night?'
Right!
Okay. Hi Emma. Well, your first birthday is over, and it was really...
Ow!
Oh, Ross, c'mon. It's my fault, I almost lost your...
I was reliving it.
Hey, nice pillow. So now tell me, is this genuine Muppet skin?
It's just the pizza place.
What?!
Well, Joey probably thinks I'll just embarrass him. Y'know, he thinks I'm some kind of a soap opera nut-Which I'm not! I'm not. Although I do know that your uh, your favorite ice cream flavor is butter pecan. And uh, and that your-your dog's name is Wally. Well look at that, I'm just stroking your arm.
God, oh God Monica, I forgot. This is our first date.
Oh my God, Jill!
Care for a cherry?
Oh that.
So?
Oh my God! Did you get to see anything good?
During a blackout? He'd get trampled!
I need to talk to you!
Okay, y'know what? I'll-I'll have toast!
Ross, it's too hard.
Oh totally, totally. Y'know it's not that big of deal, we already kinda did it once y'know.
Yeah okay.
No, the other thing. I really think it's great they work things out.
What's this?
Okay.
That's your, that's your dad's bedroom. That's your dad's bedroom!
Everybody? Shh, shhh. Uhhh... Central Perk is proud to present the music of Miss Phoebe Buffay.
Sure.
I still can't believe you invited Gavin. Allright, he is the last person I want to see.
She-she died Jill.
Umm Pheebs, remember when we were in the coffee house we decided that I was going to keep the uh, the cute guy's cell phone?
Ok. That's fine.
Oh, you know what? Let's not say anything else. I love you.
Don't!!
Nooo, he's leaving for a better job.
Oh, y'know, it's just like hats, and a shirt, and CD's, just sort of stuff that you've left here.
You were really gonna do that, weren't you?
Oh.
I went really long.
Yeah, well that's that lo-cal, non dairy, soy milk junk. We sort of, we save the real stuff for those really terminal cases.
Where am I gonna get a cowgirl outfit on Thanksgiving?
All right Joey! That is enough! Listen, as beautiful and moving as this ceremony is, it's not legal. Okay? They-they don't have a marriage license, they don't have any witnesses, and the groom only has on one shoe!
Wow, Monica, you look just like your grandmother. How old was she there?
Well, if it makes you feel any better, I wish my date hadn't shown up.
No.
Yeah do it now, call right now.
Joey!
She's mine!
Honey, it's so sweet that you want me to stay, but I-I can't do that to you. I mean it would disrupt your entire life.
Well, what is the other reason?
And that's Phoebe , and that's Joey.
Well lets see. Maybe he knows where Ross is. Hey, how's it going .
It's a different guy!
yeah I didn't disguise that very well did i.
Hi! So I'm out having lunch at Monica's and this guy starts talking to me, and it turns out he works for a buyer at Bloomingdale's and there happens to be an opening in his department. So I gave him my phone number and he's gonna call me this weekend to see if he can get me an interview!
What did you just say?
Wow! I can't believe they didn't put it in the part where you said you didn't watch soap operas.
And I will see you tomorrow!
Yeah, oh my God, tomorrow! That, no, it's perfect. Oh God, thank you soo much. Great! Bye! I got the interview!
Okay. Okay!
Oh wait-wait-wait!! No! Don't go in there! Don't go in there! I need another soda!
Oh, you're welcome a million.
Better than Chandler.
So, he's on the show, he knows what happens.
Hey! Those are all the things I'm responsible for!
No honey, it's okay! Listen, I'll got to Ross's and get the blender, you get all the margarita stuff ready.
That is neither here nor there.
Why do you care about the guy who won the Paris trip?
Yeah, and also we need more umm, drinks. Hold on a second. Whup, okay. Hello! Vegas? Yeah, we would like some more alcohol, and y'know what else? We would like some more beers. Hello? Ohh, I forgot to dial!
Yeah, yeah I think I'm gonna find my own place.
All right!!
Well it's hard to tell... Oh God, if she would just stop moving.
Geez!
Oh.
Yeah, what, so? You had feelings for me first.
Well, I-I should've told you the truth.
Listen. Sudden change of plans. My maternity leave just ended. They told me that if I didn't come back today, they were gonna fire me.
Ok, so sorry.
How come you are?!
What?!
How come you didn't come over earlier?
Uh! It's horrible!
Ohh! Hi!
And now you're watching me walk away.
Yeah.
Hey.
Okidoki! Wow! We're never gonna find a nanny.
Well Monica seems to think it's because you have feelings for me.
Uh no, he's not. Can I take a message?
Well Phoebe, we gotta do something! Well, y'know. I mean there's no way Joey's gonna make it in time. So I'm gonna through the hotel and see if there's any other weddings going on.
Hey! Hey! Hi! Hey-hey-hey, I'm Rachel! From upstairs? The ones with all the pizza?
Are you kidding? I'm trained for nothing! I was laughed out of twelve interviews today.
C'mon Daddy, listen to me! It's like, it's like, all of my life, everyone has always told me, 'You're a shoe! You're a shoe, you're a shoe, you're a shoe!'. And today I just stopped and I said, 'What if I don't wanna be a shoe? What if I wanna be a- a purse, y'know? Or a- or a hat! No, I'm not saying I want you to buy me a hat, I'm saying I am a ha- It's a metaphor, Daddy!
Whoa, how do you know about that?
Bye honey.
Yes it is!
No, honey, they're not, but don't worry, because we are going to find them, and until we do, we are all here for you, ok?
You don't pick me! You're stuck with me!
Wh-no, but y'know who did stop in here looking for ya, Tennille.
Or...I could call in sick and not deal with it at all...
All right, I'm gonna make more margaritas!
Yeah.
Oh my...
Okay... Let me put it this way. Anything from Crabtree and Evelyn?
Oh no, my dad's a doctor and he would always tell me just horror stories......about ghosts and goblins who totally supported the princess's right to smoke.
Okay. All right. Honey listen. When I tell you what I'm about to tell you, I need you to remember that we are all here for you and that we love you.
What?
Yeah, I feel kinda bad for them, but I'm also really psyched 'cause I don't have to move in here!
Hey, what have you guys been up to?
No! Wait! Wait-wait! Ross, please!
Barry?
Phoebe?
Hey, Ross!!! I told you I don't!
No, I think that was the whole all.
Okay.
What?
Oo! When's her birthday?!
Ok. Oh God. Get the camera, it's in the diaper bag.
Ross!
Oh, come on Ross! I think it would be really good for you!
We are looking for our Christmas presents from Monica.
Ok. Wha...? where? Where are you going?
Fine! I judged you. I made a snap judgement. But you did it too! And you are worse because you are sticking to your stupid snap judgement! You can't even open up your mind for a second to see if you're wrong! What does that say about you?
Well, yeah, this is the deal.
Ok, we never shoulda talked about this.
Thank you.
Ugh, how can you even ask that question?!
This is a very critical time right now. If you feel yourself reaching for that phone, then you go shoe shopping, you get your butt in a bubble bath. You want her back you have to start acting aloof.
Okay. Oh wait! One more thing umm, do-do we still need to uh settle the question of "us?"
Oh, Ross...
Hmm.
UCHH!
I know what this is all about... You've always been jealous of my hair.
Alright, somebody.
Oh, I'm sorry, were you speaking to me or sleeping with someone else?
I don't know.
Okay. It's okay. We're gonna be okay. Y'know what? It's okay. I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna boil some water and just rip up some sheets!
Oh! I have your key. Here you go.
No, not really. I mean you've seen me naked hundreds of times.
Well, I'm gonna take a nap, turkey makes me sleepy.
Ross's what?
Yeah, Phoebe you're... awful!
Monica, why? Why would I ever want to take away from your night?
Oh!
I can imagine you in a short plaid skirt and knee socks.
You saw that?
Yeah.
Why?
Hey, can I borrow the key to your house so I can run across the street and make a copy?
Oh wait Chandler, too many cooks...
Oh that's what you want.
I mean he was possessive, he was jealous, he could never just let the little things go!
Ross! Your honor, rest assured relationship ended like two years ago! And could you strike "Consummated like bunnies" from the record?
Okay, fine! But you know what? If I was in 36D, we would not be having this problem.
Yeah. So Frank, three babies. Whew, that just seems like a lot, huh?
Y'know what? No. It's not over until someone says, "I do."
That's what I told him!
What?!
Yeah, no, I don't-I don't put things in my eye.
Sandy made Madeleines.
Phoebe, I think... It's just too weird, I just saw a one year old running around with pantyhose on!
Yes?
Thank you.
Okay, well you are just gonna have too, okay. Because I already got a Mother and a Father who cannot stay in the same room together, okay, I don't wanna have to have a separate room for you too!!
Okay, he's a, he's a black capuchian monkey with a white face... ...with, with Russian dressing and, and pickles on the side. Okay. Thanks.
Joey, it would mean so...
Well excuse me, my fashion-impaired friends, I am here to tell you that hats are back.
Ohh, you can say. Come on, I don't want you to feel like you can't tell me things.
I wrote you a letter.
Oh God, Ross. Ross is going to pick up the phone. Oh, I have to get my number back. Oh my God. He's gone.
No. No.
But y'know what, if you think it's gonna be okay we'll just work out a system. Y'know, it'll be like college, I'll hang a hanger on the door and put a sign, "Come back later, I'm gettin' lucky."
Just give us our apartment back!
It won't come off!
Yeah, okay, I'll see you later.
Men just take out wind?
Well... he happens to be a very nice... guy....
Hi!
But we should move quick.
Oh, wait! Sorry, Mr. Paul? Mr. Paul?
How are you holding up?
Hey.
All right, listen, missy. If you want this cart, you're gonna have to take me with it!
I think it could be kind of great!
Oh you missed it. She was laughing. Oh it was amazing. It was amazing. It was the most beautiful, beautiful sound that...
Yeah.
Hi you guys!
Do you guys know any cute guys?
Ok, ok, ok, moving on, moving on, next question. Ok number 29, have you ever betrayed another goddess for a lightning bearer? Ok, number 30.
Yes-yes, just a few seconds and she'd still be with us-nothing about an assistant buyer?
Alright, just put your hands out and I'll back up into them.
Oh really?!
Yeah, but how much can you tell from a look?
Right.
Well first, for forgetting to throw you a bridal shower.
Okay. Oh...
Stevie the TV?
Oh.
Who is it?
Well, I like the pretty little drawing of you in the wedding dress.
Oh my god, I left the water running.
Y'know, I know it's totally superficial and we have absolutely nothing in common, and we don't even speak the same language but Goooooooddddddd....
Noo way, Kevin.
Oh and it was great to see you too. And you look fantastic, although you missed a button.
Blow it.
Hey, y'know what? I'm not waiting! I'm gonna push this baby out! I'm doing it! I mean it's what? Three centimeters? That's gotta be like this!
Tell Monica I'm sorry.
Joey, is what she just said umm-Oh my God. You were actually gonna...
Huh?
Thank you. Mon?
Alright. Thats it!
Well-well, I don't know Ross-really?
And fifty. So it was like one and fifty dollars.
Oh. Look at you making up crap for me. Oh God!
Hi!
Okay.
Yeah, well, y'know umm... No honey, listen I think it's a great idea to become friends with someone before you date them, but I think the way you do it is y'know you meet someone, become their friend, build a foundation, then you ask them out on a date. Don't hit on your existing friends!
Okay.
Well, um . . . I don't know. I mean, for a long time nothing. But you know, actually right before you picked me up, Ross and I had a . . . ah . . . little thing.
I wonder how Monica and Chandler could do it?
What? Oh my God! I'm gonna miss you so much!
There's more alcohol, right?
So Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.
Well, you know, honey, I don't think everybody gets Smelly Cat. You know, I mean, if all you've ever actually had are healthy pets, then, whoosh!
Oh, that's very-Really very-very okay.
Yeah, I know.
Oh! I'm sorry! Are we having an 89-year-old? How about Dayton?
Okay.
February 2nd!
Oh, really, really? Well, it wasn't very good for me either.
We use it!!
Ok, good night!
Look, you guys... this is really, really important to me. And it means a lot if you could try to get on board.
Huh.
Be-cause Ross is the father of my child! You know... and I... want him to hook up with lots of women! I just... All I'm saying is... I don't think that Joey and Charlie have anything in common.
Phoebe is gonna be Monica's maid of honor!
Uh, thank you Phoebe. Umm, well, what struck me most when reading Jane Eyre was uh, how the book was so ahead of its time.
Ross, you have to understand that your nice thing makes us feel this big.
He doesn't speak much English.
What if she jumped out the bassinet?
Guess who we ran into today?!
Do you guys have to go to the new house right away, or do you have some time?
I try...
Come on! I am here to take care of you! What do you need? Anything.
Ohh! And I'm one of them!! Wow! Oh, I just cannot believe this! I mean, Joey Tribbiani!
So, so sorry.
Wiener, Wiener Wiener, Wiener!!!
A lot.
Okay fine, I did. But I didn't see anything, I swear.
Do you want my pickle?
Ugh, I knew it! Oh I cannot believe those two!
Ah, I-I never should have said what I said. It-y'know what? It just doesn't matter how I feel. I mean we work together, so nothing could really ever happen between us, and what I would love is just to go to work on Monday, and-and never talk about this again, okay? Big day Monday lots to do. So, we're okay?
Oh yeah. All right, back to work.
I'm sorry, this sounds like something I'm never gonna be interested in.
I know. I know. Oh God. There's no tissue! Can you grab me some toilet paper?
Daddy, I just... I can't marry him! I'm sorry. I just don't love him. Well, it matters to me!
What?
Oh no, at the Grammies I always win.
Hey! Oh Joey, honey listen, thank you for talking to my yesterday about that thing with my boss. That really meant a lot.
Oh.
Oh... Bye guys.
Oh! Emma, that's right! You're that many!
Oh Ross, honey you gotta stop torturing yourself!
Okay! Y'know what? I realized it was stupid to get upset about not having a husband and kids. All I really needed was a plan. See I wanna have three kids...
I'd love that. I would loooove... So uh, so where is sweet little Ben? I would love to have a little...
Ohh! That's so sweet of you! Oh yum! Did you put pickles on this?
Ross! Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me....
Ross, what's the big deal? So I kissed the guy!
Oh how can you possibly know? Look at this mess, Tag! I mean, this is what I'm talking about! You have to be organized! You've got newspapers! You've got magazines! You got-Ohh! And who is this chippy? A little young for you Tag, but whatever.
There, well, see? Barry wouldn't even kiss me on a miniature golf course.
Yeah, y'know what? Don't look at it. Seriously, don't look at it.
Oh my God, wait did I-I just said Greens don't quit didn't I? Did I just say Greens don't quit?!
I can't believe they've been together for three years.
Chandler!! Promise me, you will end it.
It's my father. He wants to give me a Mercedes convertible.
Well then uh, we better make this night count. Oh wait, I forgot to turn off the cappucino machine. Anchors away. Oh no no, my purse, my purse, my purse, my purse, my purse, my pu rse. Oh, you know what. I forgot to turn off the bathroom light.
I wanna say a disease.
How many you want?
Hey... hi, ladies... uh, can I get you anything? : Did you bring the mail?
Hi, guys!
All right, you guys, I kinda gotta clean up now.
Ugh!
Shhh don't say that loud, Gunther's gonna want to hug me.
What?
Wh-wh-what? What?
Bye!
Okay, Ross, I'm really trying to tell you something here.
So, um, will you bring the truck?
What... What...
Friends!
I don't know!
Barry?!
Okay! Okay! Umm, Webster's Dictionary defines marriage as... Okay!! Forget that! That sucks!! Okay, never mind! Forget it! Umm, umm, okay, uh... I met, I-I met, I met Monica when we were just a couple of six year olds and I became friends with Chandler when he was 25, although he seemed like a six year old.
Yeah, I know, I know, I know he does. But I have to tell him how I feel! He deserves to have all the information and then he can make an informed decision.
I am so proud of Joey, I can't believe he's going to be on Law & Order!
Oh, Monica! Would you stop being such a wuss?
Maybe it, maybe it doesn't have to be this tough. I mean, maybe you were on the right track with this whole, you know, spontaneous thing. I mean, women really like that.
Well, if you see him, will you please tell him that I'm looking for him and that this I am not gonna throw up!
No, you! Phoebe you freaked me out. You kept saying how huge this all is!
I don't know. Y'know, they didn't get us anything.
Yeah! I'll cook!
You know what? There is a little part of me that really thought we were gonna win.
Are you sure?
Well, that's because of a lot of...
Oh yeah! Oh my God! That is our friend! It's Naked Ross!
Oh, come on! I'll give you ten free Ralph Lauren shirts.
What?
Hello? Mindy! Hi! Hey, how are you? Yes, yes, I've heard, congratulations, that is so great. Really? Oh. Okay. Okay, well I'm working tomorrow, but if you want you can, you can, you can come by and... Okay... Great... Great... All right, so I'll, so I'll see you tomorrow! Okay.. Okay... Bye. Oh God. Oh God. Oh God.
Oh yeah, nothing! These are happy tears! This is just what I wanted.
Okay.
You're welcome.
OK... ah, it's light... ...it rattles... it's... Travel Scrabble! Oooohhh, thank you!
Right, yeah, I've heard that about cute doctors.
Monica, will-will you marry me?
Hey-hey, now he's showing us his poking device.
We're having a girl.
Joey!
Oh, thank you.
Oh, thank God I can't hear a word that you're saying!
Okay, no uterus, no opinion.
Oh my God, they let you keep that stuff?!
Yes, the hard part is truly over.
Wow! Whoa-whoa what's under the covers?
Well those are very popular frames.
No! Wait! No, no. Don't do that! That's going to make them think they can come over here.
You are never going to believe what happened to me today.
You wanna go inside and have some coffee?
Yes. Emma and I came in a little early to do research on the presentation. I actually made a few changes, but I think I'm caught up on everything. So ask me anything!
Ross, didn't you ah, play soccer in High School? Oh no wait, that's right. You just organized their game schedules on your Commodore 64.
Wh?!
Yeah?
I think so.
Wait-wait where are you going? Where are you going?
It was only 500 bucks.
Did uh, Ross call?
Hi!
Hello!
So, whaddya think George is like?
All right, fine.
All right, I got 48.
So, um, did she...
Hi! Ok, you're ready to go pick up Phoebe and go shopping?
I guess I can talk to one of my supervisors...
Yes, I realize that...
I don't know, I mean I would give anything to work for a designer, y'know, or a buyer.... Oh, I just don't want to be 30 and still work here.
...the way you owned up to everything, it just showed me how much you've grown. Y'know? I mean my Mom never thought this would work out. It was all, "Once a cheater, always a cheater." Ooh, I just wish we hadn't lost those four months, but if time was what you needed just to gain a little perspective...
Great! We will do all of those.
Chandler gets it! It's Chandler Bing!
I did.
Maybe Joey's right. Maybe all good deeds are selfish.
Well what happened at dinner?
Oh... you're not gonna do a magic trick, are ya?
Ross, I am trying to help her become a better person. This is a huge breakthrough for her! She just offered to do something for another human being!!
My God!
Oh that's so great, now Emma has two Hugsy's.
Oh you know what? When I was a little girl I had a little pink pony named Cotton. Oh I loved her so much, I took her everywhere, I would braid her tail...
Okay! Okay-okay look-no I did, I just wanted this stuff and I know how you feel about Pottery Barn. Just... Come on don't be mad.
Joey, why would you do that?
Oh, Monica, you think Skippy liked you? Honey, all those buys had a bet to see if he can knock you over.
Come on Joey, I just bought you a new chair! The most expensive one in the store! Hey, y'know what I was thinking? We could name her Francette.
Ross, we actually watched the documentary together.
Hey, Mon, I was just doing the dishes!
Isn't it incredible?! Monica and Chandler, gettin' married.
Excuse me?
I get it!
Well umm...
All right, let's do it.
How come we have one extra place setting?
Hi Dr. Long, how are you?
Yeah.
Well, you were pretty damn good.
Ohh! You did not drop any socks!
Oh my God! You are giving this a lot of thought.
Hey! Everybody hide! Hide! I saw her! She's coming!
Oh, no sit-ups today Tag?
What are you going to make?
I'm not vanilla! I've done lots of crazy things! I mean I got-I got drunk and married in Vegas!
Oh, Monica made me send her to my mother's. Apparently babies and weddings don't mix.
Hi.
Op! We gotta go!
Yeah! I'm gonna have a boyfriend, you're gonna have a girlfriend...
Oh! Pathetic!
Okay. What?! What are you doing here?!
Are you serious?! Chandler, we ate an entire cheesecake two days ago and you want more?
Well, we are ready to try anything.
Me? Oh, no, I am not an actress.
No-no, seriously-seriously, what was the especially me part about?
Yes! Did you see that?
Ssshyeah, well, duh! I mean...
She was just crawling around and she found him, so I just let her sleep with him. That's all right? Isn't it?
Interesting.
Barry who I almost.
Ok, I've got one. Wow, those things almost never come true.
All right, okay. Alright, let's give to these babies something to cry about!
I'm fourth! Look at you with your little maple syrup award!
Hi!
What uh-oh?
Hey!
What?
Hmmmm....
Monica, you don't even have a bed, you sleep in a ball on the floor!
Yeah and we'll drop it off downstairs so that we're not tempted.
Oh, y'know what, I didn't want cinnamon on this.
Pretty much.
Hi, I'm back. Listen, I need to...
Allright. Well thank you so much for coming...
Oh, it ended very well.
Here is a book of poetry that I know Monica loves. And-and ohh God this is funny, look, this is a picture of one Halloween where she dressed up as a bride. And look, she made me carry her train, which was weird because I was Wonder Woman. Oh and here's a little purse that I found. Y'know I just thought that maybe they could hold the rings in there.
Do I have my own castle?
No, it's okay, you didn't know.
Well, that would've been very hard to say no too.
No, you guys, you really don't have to go, we're done talking.
Yeah but, maybe it's not what we think. Maybe it's tell Monica I'm sorry I...drank the last of the milk.
Excuse me! But this is a purebred, show-quality Sphinx cat!
So can we keep this between us?
Oh my God!! Ohh, that is it! I'm leaving! You are just a horrible person!
Oh!
No, I meant with the dropper over here.
Excuse me?
Joey, come on! We just went over this!
No, I think it's very obvious who's wrong here.
Yes! He has a naked picture of Monica! He takes naked pictures of us! And then he eats chicken and looks at them!
Hey, there was one Italian guy, OK, and do you even have a point?
Oh my God. Oh my God Ross, no, hang up the phone, give me the phone Ross, give me the phone, give me the phone, give me the. . .
Oh. Listen, I'm so sorry. I would, I would've never fogged you if y'know if you hadn't looked so.... Y'know.
How is that the silver lining?
Oh crap!
I was just asking 'cause I need someone to watch Emma tonight.
Oh! Oh, I love that but.
Ross, I said I'm sorry like a million times. What do you want me to do? You want me to break my foot too? Okay, I'm gonna break my foot, right here. Ow!! Oh! Oh my God, oh my God! There, are you happy now?!
Oh that's nice.
And you're no friend to those with noses.
Yeah, 15 hundred dollars.
Hey you guys, this is my sister Amy. This is Chandler, Joey, Phoebe and you know Mon.
No, not that, I mean, what about you and Mindy?
See, Gavin, you're capable of being a nice guy. Why did you give me such a hard time?
No!
All right, fine! But I had too! I had to do it for my career!
Hi. Look um, about what happened earlier...
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Would you stay here with me for a little while?
They're not true?
Hi, how was the movie?
Okay, let me just get a cup of coffee.
Ah.
Shhh...I don't know what to do, this is totally unprecedented.
Umm, honey, look he just came over to....
All right, I'll see you guys later.
Ok.
I know! I know, it's such a huge, life-altering thing.
Oh.
You let Joey drive it?!
Yeah! Okay, two larges coming right up!
Yeah, maybe if you're in love. But Ross, we are not in love, are we?
Are you makin' him a sandwich?
Oh, but of course it is!
Hey, Chandler, don't freak out! I'm telling you something you already know! Come on, she broke up with Richard because he didn't want to have babies. And she's a woman, and she's almost 30, and y'know it's Monica.
Yes, you did!
Wow! Oh-okay, look pal, I am not in the mood to be hit on right now! But if you give me your number I will call you some other time.
Oh, okay, we're going. Yeah.
Ahh, hi! Hi! Melissa, what's up? I'm just uh, about to umm, go out to the store to get some stuff to put in my backpack. Y'know, like dried fruit and granola and stuff. What's up?
Oh, slides. So really nothing happened.
Okay.
Pheebs!
I can too eat by myself!
Uh great! How do you feel about Diet Coke?
I feel like we're the only two people in the world. Oops. Sorry.
Oh, it's just... Oh, Barry, this was not good.
Well, but Pheebs.
Yes, you did!
All right, I took them. But I figured it would be okay because you got a big ink stain on the crotch.
Thank you. Thank you so much!
Good luck, honey!
Ooooo!
Good.
When you were in China.
Phoebe, that is juice, squeezed from a person.
Look I know she's a little tough to take. She has no where else to go, and she's my sister. Alright, she's Emma's aunt. And I would like them to bond.
Oh, hi.
Oh!
No, I know! I get it! It's funny!
What's 1922?
Vogue! Hey, so tell me about this Jane Eyre woman.
That's really nice.
You put these on my desk!
No.
OK.
Not at all inappropriate!
Yeah, well just be glad he's not playing a smaller instrument.
Why? Why not?! People love to hear that!
Ohh, thank God! Finally!
I'm sorry, Rosita? As in...
You're fly is open, Geller!
Look Monica, getting cold feet is very common. Y'know, it's-it's just because of all the anticipation and you just have to remember that you love Chandler. And also, I ran out on a wedding. You don't get to keep the gifts.
Oh. Oh wait no.
OK!
Alright, I got it Ross.
Did I miss it? Did I miss it?
Honey, no one thinks you're a pansy, but we do think you need a tissue.
Hi! Hey, listen, can we ask you a question? When you and Monica first hooked up, was it weird going from friends to... more than that?
Nothing.
Oh there is no way.
Off to see young Ethan?
All right, I trust you.
So Joey I just hooked Ross and Chandler up with some tuxedos for the wedding, do you need one?
Well maybe I'll just stay here with Monica.
Sup.. You want to talk supportive? You didn't even come and visit me when I was in the hospital having the baby.
Oh my God! Look at this!
You said she was bald!!
What the hell was that?!
Because I already did!
Oh you know what, you sound just like his wife!
Yeah.
And?
Oh yeah! Of course, I mean, she's gonna get over this, y'know? I mean, so you said my name! Y'know you just said it 'cause you saw me there, if you'd have seen a circus freak, you would've said, "I take thee circus freak." Y'know, it didn't mean anything, it's just a mistake. It didn't mean anything. Right?
Yeah.
Goo--ood night!
Umm, you-you and your sister seem to have umm, a very special bond, and...
We're good?
I know!
So Ross, we went out for two years, and you never told me you were in an I Hate Rachel club.
What's your problem?
How are ya?
It's not kicking right now. Although we would love to see you do that again.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I guess you weren't there.
Wha... My resume? I wouldn't... I wouldn't call my online dating profile a resume.
Uh, yeah. Uh, Monica, y'know, honey, I've been thinking about it and I've decided thisthis whole Ross thing, it's just not a good idea.
Argh. fascist.
Yeah. Just, if it's possible, could you leave him somewhere and go have sex with another guy?
Oh! Good thing Chandler's not here, he always wins at this game.
No, come on, that is a lie. We also kissed in Barbados.
Monica, what are you doing?
Hi.
Honey, why don't you sit down? Dina has something that she wants to tell you.
Ohh, well, isn't that just lovely. That's something the two of you will be able to enjoy for a really, really, really, really, really long time.
I don't like sitting up here! I'm just gonna over...
I don't want you to date her!
Ugh! No more crying! Please! I just dumped one cry baby, I'll dump you too!
Oh, that's why you got these tickets to that play, to get rid of us??
Oh, good for you!
Oh, yeah, I had too. There was never any parking by the Psychology building.
Hey Mon!
How's Ross doing? Y'know since all the Emily stuff.
No, no, no, no! Ross, wait! Come on! You know, there's other stuff. Here's a nice shirt, look at these nice pants...
So just bring it back downstairs, what's the problem?
I'm just serving it.
Oh!
Oh my God.
Oh my God! Oh, I cannot believe it!
Hi, I'm sorry, I need to borrow your phone for just one minute.
You had a club?!
Ohh, thank you for my beautiul earrings, they're perfect. I love you.
Okay, thank you. That'll be all. Wait! Wait! Did you see that? That mail guy had no idea there was something going on between us.
Yeah, 'cause that's why you won't get Isabella Rosselini, geography.
Uh-huh... right... yeah...
God!
What?
Ugh! What grandmother?
I'm pregnant. Ross? Ross? Okay, whenever you're ready. And you're the father by the way-but you got that...
Oh please, I hate packing, it's closer to work, and we do have fun. Although, I'm really gonna miss living with you.
Well, my boss was at the same restaurant where I was having my interview and he heard everything. So later he calls me to his office and he tells me that he's gonna have to let me go, because I'm not a team player. And I said "Wait a minute! Yes I am." and I had to sit there for 45 minutes while he proved that that in fact... was true.
You're right. You're right. I mean I'm about to have a baby, I can tell my mother that I don't want her to just be sleeping on my couch! Oh my God! She's gonna want to sleep in my bed with me. This cannot happen!
Well, I was actually-I-I came over here to-to borrow this lamp. To umm, look at my books, y'know, see them a little better.
Joey! It is an auction! You don't guess, you buy!
Some uh, some visual aides.
Excuse me, there was no time!
Oh! Oh! Can I give out the candy? I really want to be with the kids right now. Y'know, ever since I got pregnant I-I have the strongest maternal instincts.
"...marenge, thank you honey, and do the cha-cha. And while she like to be a star, Tony always tended bar. At the, wait, wait, everybody.."
Ok?
Yes, my wind. How do you expect me to grow if you won't let me blow?
Oh, Monica, c'mon, you do cool things.
And the fact that you were jeopardising my career never entered your mind?!
Me too!
Really?! The Plaza?!! Oh daddy!! Right. Daddy, I need to talk to you. Please, sit down.
Want a wedding dress? Hardly used.
Well, let's see... uh... I know that she has a meeting with her lawyer and then she has to make a very big poop. Why?
Ooo! Oh, I forgot they made sheets!
Okay, that sounds fair. It just means that once again we can't...
Hi Daddy!
Sure. I guess. Hey, I hear you don't have to go to London. Yay!
All right, let's go!
Hi!
We're not?!
She could be you.
Yeah, sure, okay. Okay.
Ok well, well I'm really, I'm sorry about that Joey, but do you think that maybe on some level, you don't want to take off my bra?
Phoebe! You can't do th...
Ok.
In a minute!!!
FYI..
But see, it was a plan. Y'know, it was clear. It was figured out, and now everything's just kinda like...
Oh, and somebody can get those leather pants she's always wanted!
Ugh, horrible! I did the stupidest, most embarrassing thing!
I know, so do I. Oh Phoebe, I'm so glad you made me do this. OK, lemme se yours.
Whoa, wait, listen, I think I'm just gonna talk to Ross about what he think it meant.
Are you okay?
Oh my God.
Umm, honey, look he just came over to....
He's not having an affair!
What?! She made the tea!
...And so then I realised. All this stuff I had been doing. proposing to Joshua, lying to Ross about why I couldn't come to the wedding. Was all just a way of...
Yes! Did you see that?
Yeah, yeah, I know.
I know! My God! Do you have your speech?
Hey, Mom? Having fun?
Ohh, out, oh God, I don't know why we didn't think to check there!
Hi you!
Y'know what, you are mean boys, who are just being mean!
Hey.
Here. I thought you might be cold.
Hey Jess.
Ohh! This is so exciting! Oh God... Come and knock on my door...
Oh God! Alright, fine. You know what Joey, forget it. When we go back to New York, I will tell him.
Nope. We took her to lunch.
Yes, Joanna really has been an incredible mentor to me.
Yes I am!
No! You gotta get me out of here Phoebe! These bargain shoppers are crazy!
Ooh, goooosh, ooh, these are cookies smashed in the sports section.
Sure we should... So.
No.
Oh no, I can't. I got a date.
That's-that's great! See? I already feel like I know you a little better! Thank you. Okay, come on. Now we can go eat. Let's go.
These are, these aren't for you. These are for you. Welcome to our country.
Just so you know... With us... it's never off the table.
What thing? What is this thing?
Amazingly, that makes sense.
Hm-mmm.
Ugh, is she pregnant yet? She doesn't need to be; she'll still have the baby before I do. Oh Ross, another contraction!
Well, you ripped the paper out of the court reporter's machine!!
Oh God, you saw me?! Oh!
Hey!
C'mon, you guys, what're we gonna do, what're we gonna do?
Yee. I mean, it was so weirdest thing. They fired me and then out of nowhere they just hire me back! I mean, that place must have been falling apart without me.
Joey, y'know you get any mustard on that bag, you can't return it.
That's not Monica!
Well that too. Joey?
Oh and I'll call ya too!
Happy birthday.
You guys aren't doing anything tonight, are you?
Great!
Ohhh well. Y'know what honey? The best thing to do to get over a guy is to start dating someone else. Oh! There is this great guy you will love at work named Bob! He's a real up-and-comer in Human Resources.
What?!!
Well, h-how is this like that?
Oh, terrific! That'll be $2,000.
Joey, Emma's right here! You promised not to bring girls home in the middle of the day anymore.
So you know how to fix it?
Yeah, come on! What's going in on in there?
Okay! All right! How was she?
I thought it was Chandler!
Phoebe. We would like to talk to you for a second.
I came with Paul!
And you were at this job for four years?
Yeah.
Really?
Really?!
Oh Chandler, stop talking!
Ok...this could be a little awkward...I'm just going to blow past it... well can't you just use that method actor thing where you use your real life memories to help you in your performance?
I'm sorry Pheebs, I guess I'm just really said that I'm leaving.
Ew! No!
...medium...hmm...any cookies left?
What, hey!
Hi you guys!
I-I-I didn't! I didn't! She thought you were cute.
We got some really great stuff!
Yes it is.
I have one.
Well, um, first he told me he liked how I looked. And, ah, then we had a little . . . um . . . eye-contact.
Oh great, the pacifiers?
I'm not telling.
Well Joey, uhm look, I know that she's difficult, but I think it's really good that she's here.
Hey!
You shouldn't.
Oh my God.
She you in the parking lot.
Hi! I'm Rachel Green.
Oh yeah, c'mon, I'm movin' on. He can press her up against that window as much as he wants. For all I care, he can throw her through the damn thing.
No you guys, I am not getting in a car with him, you'll have to think of something else.
There's no room under the bed.
Well, have fun!
Thanks!
Ok actually Mon, Matthew was just giving me his phone number.
Wow! If only more people knew.
How did this happen?
Whoa! My God! So what, you all just joined together to hate me?! Who else was in this club?
Well, are we all together? Like in a group?
Thank you! Break!
Yeah. Hmmmm.
Hi!
No, I'm saying...
Um-hmm. There we go. There it is.
See ya.
All right.
Look, I know you guys heard about the whole thing with me and Ross but y'know, I've been obsessing about it all day and I'd just love not to talk about it. All right?
For like a half an hour! Man, you can lie about Sweden!
Yeah, well, it's an important day. I wanna look nice. Um, has uh Dr. Franzblau been by?
Hey he's wearing a sweater.
Shh-shh-shh! The guys don't know yet do they?
You went out with a guy in the Navy?
Ohh, yeah, well I wanted to give Emily a big American good-bye cheer. So okay! Ready! Okay! Gimme an 'E!'
Ok, Pheebs, you know what, if we had that, we wouldn't be doing the ritual in the first place.
Well then you're going to have to take her out again.
Yeah?
Oh! Tommy, this is Ross. Ross, Tommy.
Oh, I was just gonna ask!
Hey!
Okay fine, what do you have?
Gimme an 'I!'
Really?
Joey, if you wanna look good, why don't you just come down to the store? I'll help you out.
Uh-huh.
Oh, well, you're not catching me on my best day.
Go on! Go on.
Okay.
Oh, I am, my side still hurts from when you crashed into me yesterday.
Hi!
Oh so you know that, you guys talked about that, so you get along, so you think you're gonna go out?
I'm not telling you what to do! I am telling you what not to do!
Joey relax! My mother picked her up two hours ago. You were there!
I can't... I can't hear it again.
Oh Joey! Joey! No, it's not you! You didn't get anybody pregnant!
Oh, little 'X's! Great! That makes up for everything!
Well, we have gotta find out if he's alive.
It's not dumb. But, maybe it's okay that you're not a part of it. Y'know what I mean? I mean it's like, I-I-I like that you're not involved in that part of my life.
Well you know, after about thirty or forty fights, you kinda catch on.
Here you go. Thank you!
Okay!
So honey, what are you gonna do about the little girl?
It's moving.
Oh no-no, no-no, they don't want you to put your hands in the pockets until you are out of the store.
They had to reduce it because of, of my deviated septum.
Hi.
Yeah it is.
I do pilates.
Hey, wait a minute! That is my sock!
Oh, OH! Wow, I love those! Where did you get them?
You got fired?!
Yeah!
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
All right. Fine.
I'm really, really not.
Ross, um, don't forget to get a shot of Emma's cake. It's in a box in the fridge.
Of course!
Alright...
Terrible? Hell, I was in Greece! That was a nice hotel! Nice beach, met the nice people. Not to shabby for Rachel.
Ooh, I have to go pack. It really does?
But....
Hi!
Excuse me, sir. Hi, you come in here all time. I was just wondering, do you think there's a possibility that you could give me an advance on my tips?
No, but I was doing my thing and everything was going according to the plan!
No, wait Phoebe.
I don't want you to see me naked!
And I also wanted you guys to know that I am telling the father today. What? What? What?
Hi! Uhh, do you guys have plans for the weekend? Because I have my sister on hold, and she said that we could use her cabin for the weekend and go skiing. Huh? I'm asking you first, right?!. I mean I'm playing by the rules.
I'll take a coffee. So how was your big date last night?
He-he said Rachel, right? Do you think I should go up there?
I don't know all the words.
They're my new 'I don't need a job, I don't need my parents, I've got great boots' boots!
Yes! Yes! I got half a mind to contract that doctor's uterus though. Mild discomfort, what's he talking about?
Okay, uh, you let me go grocery shopping, and I buy laundry detergent, but it's not the one with the easy-pour spout.
Yeah, that was an awesome day! Opening credits.
Uh-huh. Okay. You know what, Joey, I don't think he's ever gonna be okay with this.
I didn't. I got under him.
Fine. Hi! Yes, I'd like to order a large pizza.
You don't?!
Music. Very nice.
I said I'll do it!
God, Ross, look, what you and I have is special, all Paolo and I ever had was...
Yeah, we're gonna... we're gonna get some cake.
Are ah, having dinner with my Dad tomorrow night, I hope that's okay.
You-you're not wearing a jacket.
Oh, sorry.
Oh! Hi you guys, oh my God! You'll never gonna believe happened to me today! I am sitting in my office and...
No way. No way did you do this.
Because you are my sister and Ross and I have this huge history...
Oh no!
Oh! What's new in sex?
Can you believe that?!
Let me get my coat.
Yeah, I said what was okay when I thought she was some weird bald chick. I mean, y'know, that girl has hair got all over head!
Oh! Well, as a single woman, who is available, I think you look great!
Why?
Oh!! I love this job! Wow! My first call.
Well, first of all, Paulo and I are not back together. It was just a stupid thing I did, and if I could go back in time and do it again, well, I wouldn't. Um, second of all , what?
What?! Why?!
Oh wait, don't you have to pay for your, Busty Ladies?
Honey, why is it hard, I mean we've been together for almost a year now?
Ok.
Wow! This place is fabulous!
Why?
Hey!
No.
Me, Fledermaus, great. I really-
Oh honey he doesn't need my help.
It... You can so totally tell.
Oh, I am sorry...
Hi!
Okay. Honey, I would love for you to go with me. What?
Oh, I don't know. I guess it's not about no guys, it's about the right guy, y'know? I mean, with Barry, it was safe and it was easy, but there was no heat. With Paolo, that's all there was, was heat! And it was just this raw, animal, sexual...
Oh my God!
It's Joshua.
All right, look, here's the bottom line Ross, this is fixable, if we act fast, okay. So, I'll invite him to brunch tomorrow and you can make nice.
Uhhhooo.
What?!!
Hey Joey, can I ask you something?
It's a pretty cool tux.
But I hired you!
Oh please, what do you know! You married a lesbian!
Umm...that kiss before we left the apartment. That was some-something huh?
Okay, all right, give me the mug! I'll keep the mug.
Yeah, don't push it though.
No please, show me how I begged you!
It's still--It's got a tail! Get it out of here! Get it out of here!!
Yeah. Who's workin' for you babe?
You just said it!
...I mean it's my fault.
Okay..Okay.. Look. I'm sorry that I lied to you before. You were right. Ralph and I were an item but were not anymore.
Well, ultimately, I was trying y'know, I-I wanted...tell him y'know, that I'm still in love with him.
Yeah, Joey kinda disabled it when I moved in.
Ok, Ok, Pheebs...
Oh oh oh, wait! You only got whipped cream in there! Ya gotta take a bite with all the layers!
That is great. Hey, y'know who doesn't have to job hunt? Ross. He works at the university.
Oh wow, you didn't even try to unhook my bra!
Welcome home.
Look, I know what's going on here, okay, Mark explained it all to me. He said this is what you guys do.
What?! The duck?! What the hell did the damn duck do now?!
And that makes you angry because...
It's gonna poop!
All right.
Ahh.
Oh yeah. That's a great story.
Fifty-two minutes. So no-no brothers and sisters, huh? That must be nice. You don't have to share stuff.
Oh, I'm fine.
Oh, you are losing. Definitely losing.
Ohh, of course Monica's brother!
Well, then talk!
Oh! That's fine.
Do you guys ever get the feeling that um, Chandler and those guys just don't get that we don't make as much money as they do?
Phoebe are you serious?
What? I-I don't.
Why's that?
Today.
Well, I-I don't like it.
Well do you get to look through one of those like, those periscope thingys.
It's over! You have to accept that.
I know, I know. I went a little crazy.
Right...
Yeah, it is. Yeah, you know, it's tough. Single mom, career... You gotta get out there.
What-what about Monica?
Oh! Oh, no!
It's a, it's a cat!
And?
Hi! Okay, don't be mad at me, but I couldn't resist.
Oh my God, look there's Roy Gublik.
What?!
Hi, I'm Rachel.
I love it at Joey's!
Oh.
Hey, do you guys have any extra ribbon?
So did I.
Could I get some peanuts?
You know that depends on what it is! I've done a lot of stuff.
Well, thank you, Melanie.
That is hard to say, Ross. That is hard to say.
Yeah, Why? You don't think a woman can do this?
Hey.
Space cowboy!
Oh! That's interesting, since she died seven years ago!!
Ross is on a date with my sister and they shut the drapes two and a-half-hours ago.
Umm, can I use your bathroom?
All right.
Oh, and then, we got into this big, stupid fight. I just, it was awful. I told him he treats me like a park ranger, or something, oh and then I told him I wanted to take a break, I don't want to take a break.
Chandler, I'm not gonna lie to ya, but I am gonna run away from you.
Hi!
Ross said he died.
Op! You're peeping!
What?
You really think I didn't say goodbye to you because I don't care?
What're you guys doing out here?
Oh, thank you.
No, I also had to go to a couple houses with him as his girlfriend. Oh, I am just awful with children!
Ohh, God! Look at him, he's so cute. I wanna go over there, grab him, and kiss him! How can I kiss him and not letting him know that I like him?
Oh good, great! I'll-I'll keep that in mind.
HI!! Hi!
God. You seem really, really nice.
All right. Let's say I had slept with Mark. Would you have been able to forgive me?
Hide my rings.
Okay.
No, that's David.
Y'know, I figure if I can make coffee, there isn't anything I can't do.
Yeah. Why? Is that weird for you?
What?!
What's that?
Smell familiar?
Still nervous?
So, like, you guys all have jobs?
Okay, Ross, Phoebe is my girlfriend, okay, we tell each other everything. You know, I mean, come on, guys do the same thing, I mean, what about all that locker room stuff.
Oh, so you just sort of happened to leave it in here?
Oh God, that's right. I blocked that out.
Oh, that is so sick.
Umm, listen, I'm gonna need to take a rain check, my roommate is just really sick. Okay? Bye! Honey, listen, I know, I know things seem so bad right now.
I didn't have to, because I was wearing my 'I heart Ross' sandwich board and ringing my bell.
I ah... Oh! I'll squeeze you fresh orange juice every morning!
Wiper blades. I don't even have a car.
I overheard you guys on the phone the other day, and you said, "I'll just tell Rachel that I'm doing laundry for a couple of hours." And he said, "Laundry? Is that my new nickname?" And you said, "No! You know what your nickname is, Mr. Big."
Oh, no, no! I heard you before, that is so not what this is!
You want me to just quit my job so that you can feel like you've got a girlfriend?
Ross.
The job is in Paris.
Oh honey, come on, I'm sorry, I didn't.... I don't mind paying my dues, y'know, its just how much am I gonna learn about fashion by walking Mira, the arthritic seamstress, to the bathroom.
Hi!
Oh, okay see I thought, I thought you meant how much was it when it was new, y'know like back then.
Ohh!
Well, can't you just go to Vermont the next day?
Come on Phoebe, look at that! They are not breaking up, look at them. Okay that's, you know what that is? That is a, that is a second date, that's what that is! Look at that, she just put her hand on his thigh...
Well hello! Welcome to Monica's. May I take your coat?
Okay.
Wait a minute, you're only giving free stuff away to the pretty girls?
A-alright! I can do this.
Ross said my name up there, I mean, come on, I just can't pretend that didn't happen can I?
Yeah, if you're going to do the ears, you might as well take a pass at the nosal area.
Okay, I think we can get the evaluation back before they see it, but we're gonna have to get into Mr. Zelner's office. Now, he doesn't get in until 10, so he's no problem, but his assistant, Betty, she comes in early to eat her breakfast at her desk.
Oh my God! That is so good!
What?!
Oh hi!
Original.
Ok... O-k...
Look, um, I think we should talk about what happened on the terrace.
Rachel...
Doesn't he?
Oh yeah, I don't care how much she tells you she wants it, I don't care if begs, she pleads, she tells you she, she's gonna have sex with, with another man. That just means it's working.
Yeah, that was a real good one.
Yeah, well, I guess I have forgotten about Joey and clearly you've forgotten about Chandler!
Ehhh, aw! . Well, that's new!
Oh my God. Oh my God Ross, no, hang up the phone, give me the phone Ross, give me the phone, give me the phone, give me the. . .
Hey, come on now!
Ohh, so no sign of Emily huh?
Yeah! Oh by the way, thank you for loaning us Pamela and Yasmine.
Well, oh, Mark, I'm doing this for the wrong reasons, y'know? I'm just doing it to get back at Ross. I'm sorry, it's not very fair to you.
Hey.
You mean, you mean 30 days?
Oh my God!
Well, y'know what, no, you do not make my decisions because y'know what, you're fired.
No, no, no, I admire a man who can cry.
Oh, by the way Mon, I don't think the mailman liked your cookies. Here are the ornaments your mom sent.
I have an extra ticket. An extra ticket. Not, two tickets, I have an extra ticket.
Well, okay, look. I don't know, listen, I don't know what's going on here but let's...
Do you feel it too?
Your company has a fine foods division?
This was such a huge mistake. I can't tell him Phoebe. I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't...
Okay.
Okay no way, you cannot use that to get the cute guy and the last blueberry muffin.
Oh it was perfect! I mean it really felt like he was my friend again.
Well, you should have.
Cute guys in little shorts? Sure.
Joey, did you my face cream?
Y'know what Ross? You're not going anywhere. You're gonna sit right here. I'm gonna make you a cup of tea and we're gonna talk this thing whole out. All right? Hey, Dave!
Hey.
And you really think this is a good idea?
Blueberry.
Hey guys do you think this is too slutty-Hi Kash!
So, which of this kitchen stuff is mine?
No, what's he like?
I can't see it!
Well, do you want to hear what actually happened or Joey's lewd version?
Tell her to wear her own earrings.
Monica, betting the apartment, I don't know about this.
Nothing! You go!
I mean Ross all that does is remind us that you are interested in fossils.
I tried! They won't take her back.
Hi!
All right, I'll-I'll take it again when I get home.
Oh that's so cute: Ross and Mike's first date. Is that going to be awkward? I mean, what are you guys going to talk about?
Hello!
No, I have to go downstairs and come back up as if I'm coming home from the regatta gala. Okay? So just go distract him. But don't be sexy.
Gooood morning!!
Oh, that's sweet.
Yeah, it's kinda like a 'good luck on your first day' sort of thing. Is this actually a lunchbox?
Oh yeah! I mean, that was pretty intense.
Nice? They were nice. I mean, that's it? I mean, mittens are nice.
What?
Aw. Hey, Pheebs, want this?
No.
Yeah!
I'm so sorry! No I'm sorry! No I'm sorry! No I'm sorry!
Oh my god!!
Oh!! My God, what are you doing here?
You know it was you're uhm... birthday...
Ohh, great!
Do you want to put the book in the freezer?
Julie! Julie, isn't that great? I mean, isn't that just kick- you-in-the-crotch, spit-on-your-neck fantastic?
...if you tell me, I might do it.
Still in love with?!
Hi.
Ross...
Well actually thanks, but I think I'm just gonna hang out here tonight. It's been kinda a long day.
Umm, our situation. Y'know umm, what we mean to each other. And I mean we-we're having this baby together, and we live together. Isn't that, isn't that weird?
What?
Uh Pheebs, we just actually kinda wanted to be alone.
Did-did you take these back?
Oh-okay, but Pheebs?
Hi.
How is it going with Charlie?
Hello? Yes, she is, hold on a second, please. Monana, it's for you, the credit card people.
Where's Chip, why isn't he here yet?
Yeah!
Oh, it's a gift certificate to this new SPA in SOHO.
Oh Joey, I'm hardly a...
Oh, that doesn't mean anything.
Joey, do you have peanut butter on the back of your head?
Allison's birthday party.
Hey, you.... So, what's up?
No that's just--That's just 'cause I'm such a good messer!
Oh, seriously?
Oh thank god, if Phoebe's going, can we please take Emma home?
Alright, alright, so I'm not a great typist...
So, will I like any of these guys?
Okay.
Yeah. I'm-I'm telling you he's really sweet and he's really funny and he's just ugh, got a good heart. And besides, I y'know, I think he really likes you.
Wait a minute. Do you not like all dogs? I mean, not even puppies?
Oh, Phoebe! Come on! You know what, it's already three o'clock and they haven't even gotten to Emma's group yet. We gotta go, we got dinner!
Really?
Hi sweetie!
Hi!
See? I've even called Animal Control!
Hi!
She's still with you?
There it is.
Oh, I know, I'm sorry you guys. You're just gonna have to get used to the fact that I will not be dating Ross.
That is so cool.
Oooohh that's interesting.
Okay. Oh man, I swear if they sold these at Pottery Barn...
Yes, you have to get her something, and it should be something really nice.
Yeah! I'm going to Paris. Thank you, Ross!
Yeah!
I've never lived like this before.
Sure Pheebs, you know, that's what it's there for, emergencies and pretend agents.
Waitressing?
The burping clogs?
Well okay, how about four hours in a freezing museum auditorium listening to Professor Pitstains and he's 'Hey everybody! Remember that thing that's been dead for a gazillion years. Well there's this little bone we didn't know it had!'
No? All right, here's the truth um, Joey said what he said, because um, I'm attracted to you.
Oh. I'm sorry. I'm very sorry. Sorry. It's just, I'm ahh, I'm kinda excited. I'm, ahh, going to London to ahh, tell this guy that I love him and...
Yeah.
No. No. Every thing's--they're fine. Great pizza. But it's uh, actually umm my friend Ross. He uh, just gets really nervous when he's flirting.
I say 'cheesy line', but ok.
Well, I haven't discussed it with him yet, but I know he's gonna be relieved. Last week, he brought this girl over and I started talking to her about morning sickness and then I showed her pictures from my pregnancy book.
Really? How good?
Honey, stop it! I am not going to tell you until I tell him.
I don't know, it was you and a bunch of albino kids.
Good-good, don't tell him. Don't tell him. Just have him call me okay?
No, one of them...
Oh please, theyve been going out a week. They havent even slept together yet, I mean, thats not serious.
What?!
I'm thinking, I'm gonna order a pizza.
Im okay! Im okay! Mr. Heckles, Mr. Heckles could you help me please?
Ahhh! Ooh, nice!
Well I can do whatever I want! I made her! Come on little girl, hi!
Ok, uh-uh... Let's-Let's shop!!
Oh yeah, what's it about?
Oh! There's nothing above your bed!!
Aw..
Are-are you saying he's a geek?
Wow...
What do you mean? You've been in my room before!
Yeah, we got him back. Everything's fine.
Yeah, well, it's a Mercedes if I move back home. Oh, it was horrible. He called me young lady.
Yeah, and you don't mind if I call, because you only want good things for me.
No! It didn't! That's what I want to talk to you about. Now, just to brief you... I may cry, but they are not tears of sadness or of anger, but just of me having this discussion with you.
Good. How are you?
Oh hey you. Thanks for coming out of me. I know. Oh. Yeah. Oh, she's looking at me. Hi! I know you.
Oh, hi.
What, isn't he sober?
Do you want me to come over there and sit on you? 'Cause I'll do it.
No, hey, come on, if he asked you first, that's only fair.
All right. Well listen, if you see Joey will you just tell him uh...tell him I miss him.
Right, right, yes!
Heard what?
Hey!
Turned out it was a hat.
Because you took three hundred bottles of shampoo?
Y'know what, I want you to leave! Get outta here!
Well...
Yeah, but umm... Yes, but, Fonzie was already cool, so he wasn't hurt, right?
Chandler, there's a guy right over there.
Ok mom, you know what, fine, I'll make an appointment ok, but you know what, right now, I gotta go, I gotta go do a thing.
You just don't look old enough to have a twenty-year-old daughter.
Ooh, I miss dating. Gettin' all dressed up and going to a fancy restaurant. I'm not gonna be able to do that for so long, and it's so much fun! I mean not that sitting at home worrying about giving birth to a sixteen pound baby is not fun.
Listen, my mum is not bringing the baby back until nine o' clock. So I was hoping you and I could have achance to kind of talk... somebody here?
NO, no science camp!
It's impossible to find a good doctor. I mean, how do you know the good ones from the ones who are gonna push their penis against your knee?
What? Yes, I am!
Honey, we have to go. Our reservations are at 8:00.
Joey, y'know that you could just not throw the sticks up in the air.
Well, it would be easier to move just right across the hall. Wait a minute, unless you're thinking about Naked Wednesday's.
I thought you only met him once?
All right, I like that.
Oh yeah, go ahead.
Okay, but taking care of a drunk, naked woman seems like a job for Joey.
I'd love to!
Pat the dog. Oh! Oh! I get it!!
No! Forget it! I am not gonna ask Frank to give you one of his kids!!
Well now what's the rush?
Hi-e!!
Say it!
What-what are-what are these?
Oh, hi Mrs. Lynch! Is Joanna in already?
Oh man! This is so great! I actually feel like I'm going on a real date! Although, I have a hint of morning sickness, and I'm wearing underwear that goes up to about......there.
She's mine!
You remember Ross.
Phoebe, don't you think you've had enough to drink?
Yeah, we got a lot to do! We gotta think about the flowers, the caterers, the music...
Well neither do I!
No, there is no Rachel Greep, but then this other girl overheard us and she was all, "I'm Rachel Greep! I'm Rachel Greep!" and he let her right in.
What is she doing here?
I cannot, I cannot believe that I invited you here today.
Oh, wait and on the nineteenth a secret crush announces itself.
Okay, well this is all very impressive Hilda, um I just have one last question for you. Uh, how did I do? Was this okay?
You said she was bald.
Do you know something?
What are you gonna do Pheebs?
I don't think he's the one who needs help.
I can't believe this is happening.
It's so that I can spend Thanksgiving with my family. See, every year we go skiing in Vail, and normally my father pays for my ticket, but I sort of started the whole independence thing, you know, which is actually why I took this job.
Yes your honor, and here are, are forms, all filled out.
Alright, now I really have to go. Okay. Au revoir! Oh, they're gonna really hate me over there.
No, why do we always have to do everything according to your time table?
Tip of the iceberg.
Well, wait a minute! The puss is good! It means it's healing!
That was her idea, I just gave her a nudge.
But you will, you will be performing a service. Okay? Just-just think of me as a ketchup bottle, y'know you sometimes you have to bang on the end of it just to get something to come out.
Well, get 'em out of here! What's wrong with you?
How... wha... Hey! What are you... What is this? Have you guys been listening this entire time?
Thank you! Thank you!
Hi!
I know!
I'm gonna go get one of those job things.
Oh, hi! How are you doing?
Well y'know if you, if you started smoking again you could've at least told me! Come on, give me one of those! What are we talking about?
Oooohh that's interesting.
I know, I still need to talk to you.
Oh hell, he's done this three times! He knows what its about!
What? He said 'we should do it again', that's good, right?
You know what?
Oh my God!
Well, however great she was I just can't afford that.
Joey, Joey I am so sorry.
Oooh... ***I really can't hear what she says*** come here.
Hi.
so basically you've slept with all the woman in New York and now you're just going around again.
Oh, but y'know, no, you didn't give me your phone number.
Y'know what, just give me a second and I'll be out of your hair. I'm just gonna grab a jacket. When I get back, I want every little detail. Maybe that's him.
Ooh! You guys are so lucky you are here with people, you known it's such a romantic place. That's all, I just wish I could share that with a guy.
Now, she thinks that I made out with him and I did it to get her job.
Wonderful weird.
I know.
Um, excuse me Gavin, I have a question I need to ask you.
What, it's ok when Chandler does it?
Uh-uh-uh, right now? Because I've kinda got an el fresco situation going on over here.
If we broke up, and I lost you...
All right, it won't come off!
Well?
Oh I see, so this suit is making a point.
Yeah! It's weird. But the thing is need to find a date.
Ah, what is this? Well, lets see, we kissed for ten minutes and now we're talking to our friends about it, so I guess this is sixth grade!
I don't care! All right, y'know what I'm just upset that I'm getting nowhere with Joshua that-y'know what still, you do not meet someone and go flitting off to Vermont!
Well, it was all Ross's idea.
Hey Joey, is this the bed where Olivia lost her virginity?
Okay. Okay, we'll be here! Hating you! Did you see how he was sweating when he walked out of there? Listen honey, if I'm hogging the ball too much you just jump right in there and take a couple punches because I'm telling you, this feels great.
And remember how I said I was going to keep it in my purse so that if it rang I could just pick it up?
Oh, come on!
Hello? Oh, it's our nanny! Hi! Oh... God! I hope you feel better! Ok, bye! That's Molly, she's sick. Can you watch Emma today?
Phoebe's dead.
Oh... sit down, sit down. Oh, honey, you know, I once also almost married somebody that I didn't love. Do you remember Barry?
Ok, I...
Oh. Oh, those little clunky Amish things you think go with everything.
Excuse me, I wanted you to help, but you couldn't move your arms because you were wearing three life jackets.
Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight with you Ross! Look, urrgh, maybe we should take a break.
Oh, come on!
Hi!
Ohh. Oh, so you really wanted to learn. Yeah, y'know, Pheebs I just wanted to have fun. Ohh, you know who you should go with?
Oh yeah, good start Mon.
That's what I said.
Right.
And... taped back together.
Hi.
All right, well, everybody just remember where they were sitting.
Oh my God.
Oh God! Y'know what I wish? I wish you were six years older. Well actually, if I'm wishin' for stuff, I actually wish I was six years younger.
Yes, I was 4 years old and I was on the swing and then all of a sudden my hair got tangled in the chain. And to get me out my mom had to-had to cut a big chunk of my hair! And it was uneven for weeks!
Oh. We?
So I don't go back to work for another four weeks, but we would like our nanny to start right away, so that Emma could get a chance to know her.
Oh! What a great way to earn some extra pocket money.
Okay.
I'm just cleaning up.
And your horoscope says, "On the fifth a special someone is going to give you a gift."
Ah, oh God. Oh, honey, oh that's OK.
There's not gonna be a wedding. Ross and I are not getting married.
Why?!
Uh... November?
Monica!
Now I'm mommy in this little play? Alright look, I refuse to get sucked into this like, weird little Geller dimension thing OK. So I'm gonna go and take a nice long hot bubble bath because you kids are driving me crazy.
Well, hon-ey. I'm just trying to look nice for your big night.
Yeah, and he does it every year! That's why he's sending you to that play! That's why he sent us to that medieval restaurant and to that button factory!
Hello? Oh, Pheebs! It's Phoebe!
I'm hoping that if she hears it enough it will be her first word.
Done.
Ow!
Oh, my God!
It's just this thing. Every year we would go out on my dad's boat and watch the fireworks. Mom always hated it because the ocean air made her hair all big. My sister Jill would be throwing up over the side and my dad would be upset becasue nobody was helping and then when we did help he would scream at us for doing it wrong. But then when the fireworks started, everybody just shut up, you know, and it'd get really cold, and we would all just sort of smush under this one blanket. It never occured to anybody to bring another one. And now it's just...
Okay honey, now I'm gonna try to listen from right here!
Oh come on!!
Okay. Wow! So I get to see what Joey Tribbiani is like on a date. So do you have any moves?
I didn't ask you to do it!
I'm sorry honey, I'm just having a, having a rough day.
Okay, Ross, it has to be realistic.
What?! She just called and said that she was gonna be working late! She keeps lying to me! That's it! Y'know what? I'm just gonna go over there and confront them right now!
Alright. In high school I was the prom queen and I was the homecoming queen and the class president and you... were also there! But if you take this monkey, I will lose one of the most important people in my life. You can hate me if you want, but please do not punish him. C'mon, Luisa, you have a chance to be the bigger person here! Take it!
Oh well, the woman I interviewed with was pretty tough, but y'know thank God Mark coached me, because once I started talking about the fall line, she got all happy and wouldn't shut up.
No! Help me!
Yeah!
Hey-hey, you guys oh hurry up, get some, there's a whole cart outside...
