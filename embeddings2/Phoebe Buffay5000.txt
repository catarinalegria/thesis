Was it not pain-free?
Oh no! Oh! Wow!!!
Fine! Fine! Oh-oh!
Did you find the dress?
So, you're like a zillionaire?
Well, it felt French.
I'd call that excessive.
Great! Okay, good for you!

Oh-oh, that's your thing.
Okay, maybe ask this guy.
Thank you so much for this.

Well, do you think I should propose?
All right, so let's switch.

She's right! You have to stop!
Ugh, what's right with them?
You told me you hate massages!
Please...wait, how did you do that?

Um, not even a little bit.
All the time when you're cooking.

Okay, then maybe I can come too!

I don't ever want to see you again!
I'll run out and get you one.

Okay, thanks. Yeah, I'll try that.
But I don't. Me, Phoebe.
Can I tell you a little secret?
I'm still looking through mine...
Oh, you didn't have to come in with me.
So, did you pick one yet?
I knew I should have married Chandler.
Susan, he looks just like you.
Thank you, mister Bag.
That you don't stop talking about it.
You don't have any other choice!
Surprise! Look who's back!
Well, he made a move on me.
Wow? Really? That's fantastic!

She was a drug dealer!
Hey. So, what did he say?
What is this? What's going on?
Alright, whadyou do with him?
Yeah. Not looking for dates.
Really?! 'Cause y'know that hurts.
Okay, I think we have a problem here.

Anyway, I should go. Okay, bye.
You have got to be kidding me!
All right, so what were you thinking?
Hey Chandler, why so fancy?
Oh! What is that? What is that?
Oh, she's got gorgeous hair.
You know what, that's it, that's it.
Hm-mm, corn beef.

So now what's going on here?
It's nice that he has someone.
Hey there, you handsome thing.

But do you wanna get back together?
How could you possibly think that?
It's ok that's how you feel.
Thank you! And Happy Holidays.

Going to the hospital tonight?
Well yeah, that and Chandler's problem.
Does Joey have any idea?
Oh, this one's for Chandler. Here.

My God! What did you order?!
It's in the cake, isn't it?
Is it an engagement ring?
That's the door. He's gone...
Okay, don't freak out. I'll go.
What?! No! It was my idea!
All right, what's going on there?
You didn't get the money, did you?
Oh we do, but not just yet.
Well, this is none of my business.
I am definitely gonna watch that!
That doesn't lock does it?

There's sooo much you don't know.
I know. Hand me a tissue.
So? Did you get the annulment?

Yeah, yeah. You can do it to.
So, um, are you gonna call him?
Oh, look what we almost left.
Oh, whew, no, that's Bob.
I'm just taking it to be re-wired.
You can open your eyes now.
Or you can do volunteer work.
Wow, look at these prices.
Well I hope you have fun tonight.
Are you still mad at us?
Yeah! That was so weird, huh?
Is it a meatball sub?
Nooo! Why would you think that?
Who cares, it got you here.
Wow! Oh well, I will be there!
That's a, that's a long time.
Chandler, I found the perfect ring.
Now, have you told anyone else?
Well, what period is it from?
Wow! That is a bad audition.
I would, but you're the last one.
I don't know! I didn't come with her!
I, but you're so close! No!
Why? Why do I have to learn?
Have you really done this before?
Oh my God! How bad was it?

Ooh, you guys have to make a wish.
Excuse me, is this your car?
They went in together. So sorry.
OK, OK, don't get all squinky.
Oh, c'mon, like you tell me everything.
I know. This is really, really huge.
You think he's emotionally unavailable?
No. No food with a face.
Nah, I don't feel like playing.
Oh, I wasn't even thinking about that.
Just get your nails done?
One hundred thousand dollars!
I like our way. Oh! Chess!
Okay Ross! Please don't die!
Bamn! There you go! Huh?
More than I wanna get married.
Monica your remote doesn't work.
Come on, like you never talk that.
So what did you two do about it?
Okay, I'm gonna put this in the car.
Oh, yeah, happy needless-turkey-murder day.
Well, just... let's try it again.
This is the worst Christmas ever.
No one's here! Oh damnit!
I knew it! Because you love Rachel.
What? You mean behind my back?
Ooh! A Salami Buddy!
Wh-why is that the best part?
Oh, happy my wedding day to you!
Whe-where did he put it?!
Oh, that's it? A great idea!
I don't use a curling iron.
Oh, he-he can't talk right now.
Yeah, what town are we near?
Sounds like you're a little jealous.
No I-I meant your costume.
Yeah, uh-huh, a 100 dollars.
Why don't you play with your roommate?
You didn't read this one either?!
Fine, I'll give you her number.
Oooh. Oh, well this is awkward.
Maybe your scene's coming up?
Why did you go along with that?
Maybe all the rulers are wrong.
So, I'm here, ready to play.
Yeah, you're right. How's the Mrs.?
Hey, were the hell have you been?!
Not a good day for birds...
They have the best stuff in there.
I don't know, you might be the first one.
Finger sandwiches and tea.
Hey look, you guys, it's snowing!
You completely stole my answer!
Because I think it means more to you.
Well, I have plans with Joey tonight.
Oh right, maybe I'll just go home.
Oh, Gunther, can I get a scone?
That's a good idea for a business!
Well, I left my guitar here again.
Fine. Okay, enjoy your concert.
Yeah, swing music is so out.
Happy thoughts! Happy thoughts!
I've got friends too. Okay, bye.
A little. Now you're talking.
Yeah, I know! So, what do you think?
I'm having another heart attack!
Bread, so you never go hungry.
No that made me feel precious.
Exactly! Because it's in the past!
Well, that could've been really awkward.
Oh my god, we killed Bob!
Now, it's you little bunny friend.
So when, when do you leave?
uh huh how do I look.
Oh my God, they took my idea!
Why are you looking at me like that?
Hey. Ooh! Don't sit down!
All right, I think I'm gonna head out.
Oh my God, look! That's Elizabeth!
Wow! You guys really don't know anything!
Your middle name is Pamela?
What, what are they talking about?
I want to see what he wants first.
Alright, here, you have to hold this.
Yes! Exactly! And that's why...
All right, I have ya. Oh God.
Oh! Here's Joseph Francis!
So was it a lot more money?
No. You're not, you're not stupid.
Wait, does he eat chalk?
You missed a belt loop.
You're all invited to bite me!
I know! Robin is so gay!
Uh-uh. Ok. What time is that.
God! God! This is not going well.
So, what movie should we see?
No, no, he hasn't been around.
Ooh! How was Kathy's play?
Well, didn't you just hear what I said?!
Hey, Joey, I got you another present.
Umm, Chandler, Monica, this is Don.
Ohhh. Thanks Chandler they're great!
Mr. X and Phoebe Buffay.
Because it's our thirtieth birthday.
That is brand new information!!
No, don't look directly at them!
Which proves that I never lie.
I know, they're gonna be so happy together.
No, I'm fine. I'm great. I'm with you.
Oh, not anymore. I changed it today.
What are we gonna do? I'm starving.
You can't give up on your dream.
Oh, it's the worst way to propose!
Why won't you let me massage you?
Okay, alright, I have a question, then.
Does it look like an ashtray?
Well, I'm kinda on a clock here.
Ok, ok, so how should I do it?
Good! Great! You can go first.
Yeah, it's for our catering business!
So, are you ready to talk about it?
Hey hey hey! She's on!
Shhhhhh! I'm swamped right now.
We did have fun, didn't we?
Bye Chandler! I miss you already.
Maybe just 10 minutes for you.
Well, she really wanted to talk to you now.
Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm, who's next?
Listen if you wanna go, just go.
What are you, what are you doing here?
Well, mine was worse than that.
That's all right, that's well, I figured....
YEAH...! How great is this...?
There he goes, your fiance.
Maybe, maybe I'll dance for you.
I can't believe you... ..did this.
Mike doesn't ever wanna get married.
Uh huh...we're playing you two.
Well then, you should look with us.
No, but you're questioning my method!
Really? You're moving on from Ross?
Um, Chandler, Ross, this is Robert.
No! No, that you and Rachel are engaged!
would you call this girl? thanks-fo-r-a-love-ly-even-ing.
Oh look! That guy's peeing!
Yeah, we-we feel kinda responsible.
Your secret bachelorette party...
Hey-ooh so, how was Vermont?
Ooh, I love that place! So, no.
Yes, but there isn't always time!
But why does it even matter?!
He could be in disguise, y'know.
OK. Oh Monica! Guess what!
Ohh, give him a kiss for me!
Oh, just as well, I broke this one.
Thank you! Oh, and I have something for you!
It's a Ms. Pac-Man machine!!
Uh-huh, great story! I'm going!
What's the matter? Why so scrunchy?
Oh, are we gonna trash that place?
Did he go out for a cigarette?
So, um, have you told your parents?
Yeah! You're such a great friend!
Listen, I think I've left something here.
Damn, that window is clean.
Please, Monica? In the hall?
Excuse me. Umm, is Vince here?
There he is! There he is!
Aaah... you're not good at this...
Yeah. And, first here's a gift.
Okay. Ooh, y'know we could just do this.
What, so what are you gonna tell him?
I can't believe what I'm hearing here...
Well, I'm no longer Phoebe Buffay.
Good! Good! Five points!
You're kinda stepping on the song.
Now you know how you really feel about it.
Just, you know, to see... um.
Yes! She's very excited about that.
I know. Have you considered pageanting?
You-you...you had sex with Ursula?!
so you don't think I'm a total freak.
Yeesh, what'd you do about it?
Hey, so? Are you gonna do it?
I'm sorry, I'm with a client right now.
Hey what are you guys looking at?
Yeah, in the back. You want a quarter?
Come on, take 'em off!!
Oh, what beautiful lukewarm sentiment.
Well, why don't you just get him fired?
Are you leaving "The Supremes"?
Yeah? Well this is not what I ordered.
Or you could end up with everything.
So, do you have any other possibilities?
Grandma's gonna have to get in line.
Ohh, the-the Foster puppets!
You wouldn't let her have a grape?
Hey. Ooh, look at you, dressy-dress.
I'm curious about the human body.
Yeah, y'know, people can be so self-involved.
Okay! Okay! I'm so glad you're here.
Are you wearing waterproof mascara?
Come on, there's gotta be something.
Ohh, I lost my mom to suicide.
I have liver damage. Ow! Oh!
Oh. Ha-ha-ha. All right, anyway...
Do you wanna get to Rachel in time?
No, I wasn't gonna ask you that, no.
I don't know. A cowboy theme?
Umm, yeah, uh-huh, they're implanted.
You're sure? You're absolutely sure?
Jeez, you say one thing, and...
She sells drugs to kids.
Bye-bye! That's why I moved out.
Where do you think Mike really is?
Ohh, ohh, Lorne Green?
Umm, I think you're really, really great...
Which you just gave up really quickly.
Me too! So happy for them!
Yeah, I can't say croissant. Oh my God!
Wait a minute. What's his name?
Well, tell him, apology accepted.
Monica! I'm sorry I'm late! Monica?
Nope, not knocked up yet.
Okay, I think I need to do some shopping.
Do I? Thank you, so do you.
I never had a bike of my own.
Will you get us better gifts?
Thank you Rachel but, look at Monica!
Okay, but this can't be good for the baby.
Uhm... well, they're not in the wedding.
Alright, no, we could look at them!
Yeah. Yeah, that's what you need a good...pill.
Yes, we should. I think we should.
Well why don't you use your key?
Yeah, I kinda do. Well, how's this?
No. I'm-I'm to depressed to talk.
So are you actually gonna see her again?
OK honey, you're dating Ross.
Well last night, I met Monica's.
Nothing, there's nothing wrong with you.
Yes. Did you settle the bill?
Paolo made a pass at me.
What?! Well he never said that to me!
Come on! Look where you are!!
But we've only had one job.
Look, I don't wanna talk about it. Okay?
Oh my God! Monica's just gonna kill you.
My little brother's getting married!!
You don't have to be back for a half-hour!
Relax, it's not like we're forking.
Would you care to venture one?
It's-it's not negative, it's positive.
I-I sure will, take care.
You guys. I'm sorry about your shopping.
Umm, well, umm Grandma died.
Are you asking me to have a frenaissance?
You're still gonna go out with her?!
OK, who is the boss of you?!!
Hello, is this the creepy residence?
So Monica, what were you gonna tell us?
Okay, this is from your friend at work.
Why are you dressed as a gladiator?
Bing, what an unusual name.
Alright. So um, stilts huh?
Sure. Do you need some floss?
We stand firm at $10.
I-I wanna be with her, I like her.
That was a test and you just failed.
And a small piece of chocolate.
Wow! My breasts are really strong.
Joey, look at me! I'm a nurse!
I'm wearing his briefs right now.
Hey will you get me tickets too?
No don't tear out your eyes!!
Well, just buy the damn boat!
Hi Gram. Whatcha doin'?
Wow, you told your dad the truth.
So how was, how was your date?
Well, then tell him to stop staring!
But again, Simmons. Go on.
Thank you. We both forgive you.
No, but it is fast. Isn't it?
For God sakes, it's Rachel!
Hmm, I wonder why. Pervert!
Umm, I'm trying to move that pencil.
Because I cared enough to lie!
You're not making the pies yourself?
Great, ok faster! "je"
Ohh. No that's okay, he's a friend.
Oh my God! Chandler just left though!
Theodore... Bitsy... What a delight!
Didn't it like totally speak to you?
But I already gave them back to you!
And then... your face is bloated?
Oh, because, you know... they don't like you.
OK, here I go. I'm goin' in.
Wait! What?! No!! Elevator!! No!
Ooh, you nailed the Old Lady!
Yeah, she was bald, she's not now.
Ok, don't hold thy breath!
Oh my god, I'm gonna be on TV!
Oh! Oh! Oh no!! You swore!
Oh yeah, that's right, the keyboards, huh?
So, uh, why didn't you say anything?
Living with you would make me happy.
Ok, don't get me started on gravity.
Yeah, or, or, or, Mississ-Pete.
Hey you guys! Look what I just got.
Like a date type person?
So you do know who he is! Sorry.
Nothing, you just have to be cool with it.
Shhh! Shhhh! Joey's asleep.
Wow! Talking about high maintenance.
Oh, no wonder I don't feel full.
Well, you were wrong, he doesn't like me!
So, what happens to the old guys?
That's too hard. Too hard!
But Mon, you have to get our money!
I don't know, it's such a long trip.
I'm trying to get your parents to like me.
We could have breakfast in bed...
Yeah. The '92 Ross wouldn't.
Oh my God! I love things. What happened?
Yeah, I know. It drives me crazy.
Is there anything we can do for you?
Ohh, well, you're my lucky penny.
No, lets just draw straws.
Another lie. You have a sickness!
I know you didn't, I was talking about Monica.
Oh that tart... floozy... giant...
Oh, sure! Bye Ross! Forever.
I love the license plate game!
Maybe that's 'cause she's not really gone.
Although, don't feel like you can't visit.
Shhh!! Please! What's he saying?
And that horrible museum tour!
Um, oh, I got you a birthday present.
Oh, I can't believe you called her fat.
Oh, witty banter. Well done.
My Father is Chuck Magioni?
Yeah, I locked him years ago!
Time for your scalp massage!
Rachel and Joey! It's Rachel and Joey!!!
So-so, what do you want for lunch?
Oh, she looks just like a little doll!
Ohh! So, did you get to meet her?
Yeah. You won't be able to take it.
Really? That hadn't occurred to me.
Well, how much do you think he needs?
Then yes that is what I'm having.
Oh, I hate this. Everything's changing.
Hey, do you wanna go to dinner tonight?
Oh, he needed some time to grieve.
Good for you. That was really mature.
Yes, she jumped right back up.
Um-hmm. Oh wait! This is Bonnie.
Oh! Ooh! Oh Monica! It's so beautiful.
So how are things going with Paul?
He's miserable! What happened to him?
Oh my God. Was Mike with him?
All right, I'll see you downstairs then.
Does anyone wanna watch TV?
Yeah, why don't you just find another apartment?
Oh, it's Ross on one of his drives!
Hey, y'know what might cheer you up?
Ohh, Monica, I am so excited for you.
Good! Good! I was just testing you.
Joey, I can't believe you would do that for me.
Did I miss it, did I miss it?
Hey Rach, you wanna get some coffee?
Russ is Ross. Russ... Ross!
Who the hell are all these people?
Yeah, not the one I had my eye on.
That's weird. I bet they're doing it.
Hey, Julie! Hey, how are you doing?
Ooh, wait.. wait, I see a woman.
Okay, um, oh, the zoo commercial.
You ate meat! You had sex!
It kicked! I think the baby kicked!
Yeah, I definitely. I don't like the name Ross.
So did you sleep well last night?
Oh, look, he's got Ross's haircut!
OH! He's having an affair.
Alright, could I just ask you one question?
Oh, thank you. Four would be great.
Okay, well maybe not on those levels.
Have you seen your guy's body?
No! Oh! You're alive! You're alive!
Oh, right! Your adoption interview!
OK, now I'm gonna kick some ass.
Ooh ooh, we have a live one!
I won! I won! I finally won!
Which is why my answer is yes!
How do you even know a woman like that?
So uh, now look at the picture...
Oh honey no, you ate it all.
Oh, I want to look too! . Yikes!
No! You should've read it yourself!
Wow. Okay, I don't know how to talk to you.
Yeah, this is the guy I was telling you about.
See? Vegetarianism benefits everyone.
Huh. Okay. Well, I'm really happy for you.
No, but let's come back to that later!
Give her a key to your apartment.
Oh! Ooh! Oh, I didn't know that you did...pot.
I don't know. Who's Soupy Sales?
Don't you just love the way they talk?!
Nah. I kept myself busy.
Mike Hannigan... will you marry me?
It's not Santa's plan. No, it's...
Ohh. . .K. How come?
Y'know what, forget it. It's ruined.
Y'know, suddenly I find you very attractive.
Oh now, don't give away the farm!
Okay, great so do you want to do it together?
You've never asked a guy out?!!
Maybe, because you told him not to.
Okay, we're gonna take a short break.
Oh, God bless us, everyone.
Well, what you're wearing is fine for that.
Oh! Hello? Yeah this is Phoebe. Really?!
Oh, got it, stay upwind of me.
Joey, it's Phoebe. Did you stop Rachel?
I don't know what I'm gonna do about this coat.
I could've been killed I hope you know!
Ok so will he be back soon?
Oh my God!! The baby just kicked!
Oooh! You are a very bad man!
Yeah, I know, but I don't think that means anything.
Okay. Okay, but you can't fire him today.
All right. Did everyone get out okay?
They're not even touching the lasagna!
Don't even get me started on yours!
Yes, you do. Chandler loves Kathy.
So you're gonna... hit on her?
But you-you-you came to see Lilly?
Whoa, what kind of party was this?
Er, Rita, this is my husband.
Oh, ok, um, I mean Frank senior.
Ok. What are you gonna be doing today?
Look at all the stuff people sent!
No, you have to let me in right now!!
No listen to me! She is crazy!
You know, it's fine. We'll pay you.
You're right! You're right. Don't say it.
Wow, Carol really messed you up!
And a glass of tepid water.
Ok, then maybe it'll be, uhm...
All right, so, so you went to Pete's...
Okay, I know. Hold on. Hey Ross?
Oh my God! I know who the father is...
Wow. What are you gonna use it for?
Oh no! No! I know how to handle it.
One? How about a whole bunch?
Does that mean Carcass is available?
Forget her! You enjoy this!!
Hi hi...Oh you have got to sing.
Oh we can't, we already have plans.
What's with all the bottles of liquor?
Ha-ha, it's not my baby, ha-ha-ha!
Oh yeah, your microwave. The stereo.
Y'know what Joey left on my pillow?
I know Mike, why don't you keep digging?
Umm here's your 3-D glasses.
Good God man don't anger it.
I brought you my old maternity clothes!
No that is the last thing you want to do!
Ohh, he left his cell phone.
Calm down. Maybe you're not pregnant.
You know, I'm always right about these things.
Yeah! So you're gonna call this one back?
No Rachel! They got here first!
So did Heldi show you the place?
Well I'm sorry, I thought you said it was okay.
Hi! And you're going into what grade?
That is so great! Oh, I... Oh my God!
Ooo, a crossword! Can I help?
Wow, that's close. When's yours?
That's really beautiful. What does it mean?
Sooo, what's goin' on, huh?
Oh that looks so good, oh I love it.
Have you seen him throw a ball?
Oh! Yeah, this is fun, couples night.
All right, the seven of us miss you.
Monica, do you want us to take you home?
Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree!
Wait, I think I know someone who does that.
Well, alright, that's fine. What about Leslie?
Ok, you're gonna have to not touch my ass.
Oh that's a nickname we were trying out.
Come on, it's not that big a deal!
I-I-I-I-I don't know, I don't know what to say.
Come on. It doesn't taste bad.
Okay, so what do you guys really think of Chandler?
So how's the piano playing going?
God, I hope they kick his ass!
But why didn't you just tell her the truth.
Oh yeah, like there are police for that!
And you... Your home is lovely.
Sure, oh, is, is Frank home.
Wait, Rach! Where's the other one?
Ick-neck-tree-anis..... There's a 'g' in there.
Hey! Oh, how did baby shopping go?
Really? Lee Majors is hot!
Are you sure it wasn't an oyster?
And you know, I have a massage client soon.
Oh no, the dog's not going to be there!
Let's just say, I'm glad I'm not Chandler.
Hey! So Chandler, wanna go to the coffeehouse?
Maybe we have the flight-number wrong. God.
The woman who cuts my hair!
...Then I've already seen this one!
We could not, would not want to wait.
Mike? Okay! What's his last name?
Well then, what about you?! Huh?!
That chick can't handle my corner.
Hey, why are you mopping your ceiling?
Oh, hey, Chandler I wanna hug you too!
I'm sorry, there's laughing in my head.
Alrighty, here come the water works.
Alright, well, maybe now its not okay.
Ah, Catwoman. So we meet again.
Regular Celery! Oh, I already have that.
Yeah, think so. Oh! Huh. Whoah.
You know, the asthma guy was really cute.
Everybody looks so happy. I hate that.
You don't see it? You actually don't see it?
Well, of course not for tonight. Yeah, hi!
"Pick up grandma at the airport"?
Great! Yeah, could you bring me the newspaper?
Wow! That's so great! Oh! Oh! Cougar.
Guys, the drawing is about to start!
Oh my God! Oh my God, we are 31.
Okay, here I wish you health and happiness.
Okay, we'll talk about something else then.
No, back to happy. Back to happy!
Oh, this is it. This what's gonna kill me.
Please Rachel, I am not an idiot.
Woo-hoo, first weekend away together!
Well this doesn't even smell like opium.
No, I've got work and then I'm proposing..
Okay. Umm, oh! Okay, I see a circle.
This pregnancy is throwing me all off.
But... I'm ready, so, just deal.
Oh good, oh Joey and Chandler are back.
Okay, doctor says any minute now.
Oh yeah, so you can walk around naked.
Wow! Hey, why are you all dressed up?
Oh, some guy she met at the movies.
Ooh, honey. You stink at lying.
Morning. Rach, I'm here with the purses!
How about we talk about this over dinner?
Hey! Don't you give me any of your-Hey!
Well, I hate to eat and run, but...
Ahh. OK, let's see yours again.
No, I can handle it. No, I'm a professional.
Oh, you're no ordinary roommate are you?
Thank you, very much! Oh! Thank you!
Ok, who wants to hear something ironic?
Oh my god! Shouldn't we stop this?
Oh! No, I-I think I just had a contraction.
What are you talking about? Sarah's great!
Oh, how do you play the shadow game?
Nope. Zilch, nothin', uh-uh.
Oh...yes..is this..umm..Emily's Parents' house.
I know. So, what's going on with you and Ross?
She is so amazing! You have no idea.
Ewww! Oh! It's the Mattress King!
Now, we can kick anybody's ass!
I don't know, I don't have anyone right now. Y'know?
Well not exactly like the one in the poem.
Oh, okay, except I broke up with Roger.
You know, if you want, I'll do it with you.
Okay, so it's probably just the Ross thing then.
Here, look, alright, does this help?
The little jail between the doors!
Oh that's right. You're still set on that?
Uh-uh. Ehm, a Knicks game.
Three hundred dollars, are you kidding?
Umm, hey Rach, can I ask you something?
I didn't know Playboy prints jokes.
Y'know, it's even worse when you're twins.
It could be like a big giant guy.
I don't know, I kinda like Bob for a girl.
No-no I can't! I can't let you do it!
Uh-huh, yeah, that's my cheat sheet.
Great! Okay then it's just us girls!
Anyway, you did what you had to do. I'm okay.
Ten dollars an hour for what?
No-no, sorry. Cookies are good, thanks.
Well, what kind of guy are you looking for?
Then why did she ask us to...
Oh, it's okay, it was just my left leg.
Monica, Monica, you know what gets out hummus.
I'm not gonna right to you! That's not real!
So do you want to hang out or something?
Who's day just got better? CHANDLER!
Why not?! Maybe I can, you don't know!
Oh, okay, I'm sorry, thank you for my azzz.
No, no, that's the ghost for the attic.
That is nice and we're done. TADA!
Oh, somewhere Joey's head is exploding.
I'm just saying hi! Now I'm gonna go!
Man, tough week for Estelle!
Oh! All right. Now, let's not do this!
Wow! I owe Rachel 20 bucks!
No! No, the robots just work for them.
Come on, Mom, I'll take you home.
No spark? Didn't you sleep together?
Wait, wait, why were you at the courthouse?
Yeah! But I'm a little shaky and nervous.
Oh my God, you've got to stop chattering!
Look everyone, it's the spirit of Thanksgiving!
No. This is what I do for luck, ok.
Mike, you don't know, you don't know what you're doing!
And also, we don't know what to do with this.
You didn't say Boutros Boutros Gali.
Oh, 19! We thought you said 90!
Well, I don't think Monica is gonna take this away.
Well, y'know we don't call it that, but yeah!
Undo it. Undo it. Undo it.
Okay, not a fan of the tough love.
Yeah, but you shouldn't compare yourself to me.
He seems to hate you. Are you sure?
So instead you told me Monica was pregnant.
Oh. No. No. Good! Yeah, me neither.
Oh my God! How did you get back here?!
Right! Never! Never! I swear!
You know who shaved you? That was me.
About how good your cards were.
Oh, yeah try that. So, is that better?
Why don't you turn them inside ou...
Ooh, Joey, that's actually a really good idea!
This is how I look when I'm turned on!
You were fantastic! I'm so proud of you!
Oh, no, I have the cutest Christmas story!
Oh, see, Jack did love the cow.
Did I use that already today? I'm sorry.
Oo! Is it for my birthday present?
Well then definately don't take his name.
No kind. He just makes it up.
Oh, it's so great to see you feeling like this!
You can still sleep at night and stuff.
By the way, it's a costume party.
Mrs. Waltham. Hi. It's Phoebe again.
No, don't-don't say I'm sorry with porn!
Oooh. Girl's night out indeed.
Oh I know, I helped pick out the ring.
Wow, it's like a dirty math problem.
Sure, what.. what was the work thing?
I just lost a whole year of my life.
Oh no! No God, definitely not jealous!
You guys make a very attractive couple.
Noo! But that would've been so cool!
Okay quick, help me get this off!
NO! THEY'RE DOING IT!!!
Well, it's great that you're back! How are you?
Alright, I'll try, fine! Yes, Okay!
Hey Monica, what about your extra tickets?
It's okay. Go ahead, ask me out.
Well did she know you two weren't married?
Oh my God, has she slept at all?
I don't care... I'll be my something blue.
Ooh, this is it! Oh, that's him! That's him!
Mm-hmm. Throw me a bone here.
Yeah, you mean like that you're kind of a loner.
But hes falling in love with her.
No, whad'ya mean? He's not British.
Still, he had to find out sometime.
Uh, we were at the Spelling Bee!
Oh God, I really missed that fat bastard!
Right. Except that I do want to get married.
Great, I'm seeing water rings again.
If she says no, can I have the ring?
No, wait, oh, what are we sorry about?
Okay, well you put down the toilet seat.
Uh-oh. She may be onto us.
But, your Rachel wasn't whiny enough.
Well, you know what, they're our responsibility now.
Uh-huh! Ross invited us all to watch.
Well, if you're leaving, I'm definitely gonna go.
OK. Um, how come I'm walking with you?
Okay, I asked for the news, not the weather.
What happened to the intimate dinner party?
Okay, what about after I give you these candies?
Really? Even more humiliating than.
Yep. Put more gas in.
I..., a jingle? No, no-no-no, no.
Okay. Do you guys want me to play for you?
We want the last six years back!!
I don't know. Ooh! Ooh! Look it! Ah-ha!
You heard her too?! You have the gift!
Y'know, me, Rachel, the birds, the babies...
Guess we'll never know how it ends.
Umm, that paper's two weeks old.
Oh my God, you're giving your real number.
Oo! You should have one of us do it!
Can you believe how much this is gonna cost?
All right, c'mere, gimme your feet.
Because you would rather live here with Joey.
Okay. Oh umm, Chandler, Monica is looking for you.
Ahhh!! Chandler and Monica!! Chandler and Monica!!
You're not? See, that's why you're so great!
Hi. I just had the worst anniversary ever.
You wanna work on your interview skills?
Ooh, ooh! Why don't we invite her?
Yeah! In... really long hour world.
Joey? How could you just let them leave?
So you still hadn't heard from Emily?
Look at you! How, how do you feel?
Look, why don't you just pay for it yourself?
You guys, what was the Powerball number again?
Please don't leave me, I'll be lonely.
Oh no. Did umm, did she say why?
Oh! Okay! Yeah, that's okay. Have a seat.
Ok, it's too hard, I can't teach you!
Oh, I wish I could, but I don't want to.
Taffy, really? I've never had any.
Okay, we-we'll talk to you later. Okay, bye.
Good. I should really start wearing hats!
Yeah. I'm Phoebe Buffay-Hannigan Banana Hammock.
Ow! My ass. Okay. Okay. Oh, shhh!
Oh my God! Monica's gonna totally freak out!
But... but... but we're giving you this!
Were you guys making fun of Parker?
Yeah, but then I can be you sidekick Vunda.
Your last dance. Do it for us.
Yep! Okay, gotta go, talk to you later.
Oh, Paolo, hi, what are you doing here?
Would you say your pesto is the best-o?
I dunno, 'cause you're smart, you're funny...
Oh! I won't say, 'no' to a movie!
Okay, cancel backup! Cancel backup!
Well, I didn't think I should just drop by...
Oh, she sees him! Oh, they're hugging!
I worked in a Dairy Queen, why?
Guess what? You're almost an uncle!
Here it comes. Our first kiss.
Oh, exellent. Everyone was so, so nice.
Wanna see mine, wanna see mine?
All right. Well, don't worry, I call shotgun!
Oh my God, oh my God! Poor Monica!
Oh, wait, wait. Clogs, or claws?
Okay! I just-I didn't know that you are a lesbian.
Oh, I don't know. I mean it was fun one time.
Whoa! Why do you get to answer the door?
Okay. Is it a kind of hot sandwich?
No, not wieght... y'know, more like insulation.
Ah! Oh my God! You r-r-rotten boys!
Hmmm? Yeah. So, um, is she fat?
Easy. Step. How did it get on?
Hey, look who's up! How do you feel?
Why, why, why didn't you just say no!
No, just a regular old flying dwarf.
Hey, excellent, excellent water-table thing.
You should have thought of that before you got in!
Shh! Nothing works with this child!
Oh, hey, Monica, I brought back your iron.
Oh, no! I- I can't drink this now!
Okay. Umm, ooh, ooh-oh, I have a game!
Oh he knows! For the most part.
Most likely. Okay, I'm gonna be out there.
They've been quiet for a long time.
Yeah? Okay, I think I'll play it at the wedding.
Yeah, not in your case Lovey Loverson.
We could eat the wax! It's organic.
OK, Rachel, why don't you start talking first.
Don't point that thing at me, Tribbiani!
Oh yeah, you're solid. Yeah, you're just no me.
Uh-oh. It's Scary Scientist Man.
Oh, yeah, sure. So, how was your day?
Well, I've never gone this fast before.
Great! It worked! No one's sad.
She's got her cell, you could call her.
All right, stop it, you're freaking me out.
It's okay. What the hell took you so long?
Wow! How long were we arguing for?
Hornswoggle? Ooh, this must be killing you.
Oh my God! I'm sorry, too soon. You go.
Ok, well, are all the tickets in the bowl?
How-how about you each get five vetoes?
That's fine, just don't bring it in my mouth.
Well, I-I wasn't hopping mad, y'know.
Y'know? Ooh, you can almost smell the opium.
Yeah, except your breasts look kinda small.
Hey! Ooh! How was teaching last night?
Yeah, sorry boys, this ride's closing.
Right there! That's why I'm marrying you!
Oh, look, he's closing his eyes again.
Yeah, ok. You probably did everything you could.
We have good news, look whose back!
I already had a baby. Leave me alone.
No. 'Cause you need that. No, it's okay, thanks.
Well, that's not something a girl wants to hear.
Yes, it reminds me of a simpler time.
Y'know, there's gonna be lots of other stuff.
I'm sorry, I can't do this. I'm not an actor.
Look everybody, look at my new dollhouse!!
I'd say that chair's taking the brunt.
So... What's the deal with umm, you and Joey?
No! No, she said you actually proposed to her.
I don't know, I hardly ever say that about people.
Well, if you really, really want it, then it's okay.
Oh. Oh! Ma'am? Excuse me, ma'am?
Oh no! He's not getting away that easy!
Mate? They're all brothers and sisters.
Then I'm gonna have to ask you to keep it down.
Yeah okay, no if it helps you okay. Yeah.
Yeah, it's... Y'know there's-no you may not!
They're gonna get through this, aren't they?
Yeah! Now, why do you want to kill yourself?
OH!! MY EYES!!! MY EYES!!!!
Ah! Okay so that would make me Susan.
Isn't there a national football league.
Wow you guys got a hospital? Fancy!
Why, so he can get mad at the baby?
There you go. Okay, do you think you're gonna be okay?
Oh that'd be me. Sir. After you.
Oh, hi Max! Hey, do you know everybody?
Does anyone want the rest of this Pop-Tart?
Oh, COOL!! Wow, it's like a time capsule!
Ok, so I guess we don't invite her parents.
Turkey's are beautiful, intelligent animals!
Ross, you've got to tell her how you feel!
Are you gonna open the presents without Chandler?
I thought you said you read it in high school.
Okay, I'll do it, but just these three, right
Wait a second! So, what's new with you?
Absolutely, oh I promise. Tell her what?
Well, y'know I'm wearing layers and it's warm.
Why? Why would you wanna... do that? Why?
What about Glen? He could be a Glen.
I'm gonna get some coffee, anyone want anything?
Hey Mike, what's the capital of Peru?
So is Joey going to have to give up the apartment?
I don't know about that. I've got one that's worse.
Hey, do you need to get in? Here you go.
Well you obviously didn't see Chucky 3.
Hey Leslie, how'd you know I'd be here?
But people that you don't know and will never see again.
Umm, look it, you-you can't kill yourself.
Your knuckles are kinda hairy too...
Marcia and Chester are mad at Phyllis.
Yeah, we both can. And we both will.
Great, let's begin. How's the pressure?
I really, really enjoyed it. Very exotic.
Oh, I have a headache. A horrible headache!
Hey. We found her, we found the girl.
It's so obvious, why doesn't he just ask?
Oh, I am sorry but I am incredibly talented.
Oh, okay. Feel better, Rachel, 'kay?
But now she'll never know how he feels!
Um, um, Rachel can we talk for a sec?
Since when are you into swing music?
And you thanks for the face massage. Thank you.
It's a normal Swedish name... Ikea...
Hey now you have two. Oh, now you have two.
Oh right, like they're gonna let me have a passport.
North route or south route?
Look out, incoming pumpkin pie!
I do, he's been working on that all day!
Hold it! N.Y.P.D! Freeze punk!
I think on some levels she already knows.
: Oh I see, so then, you were lying.
Umm, is-is that because you're out of toner?
I wonder where she is. That is so weird.
No, I mean I was really acting my ass off.
What? What happened to the window in the attic?!
I can't believe you're gonna ask Monica to marry you!
You guys, why didn't you tell me you were eloping?
Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew!
OK, I can be a waitress, I can be a waitress.
Hello? Yes, I'm the one who found your phone.
What else do they add smell too?
Actually, it makes us feel that big.
Yeah, you're right. This is none of our business.
Then that's not breaking the law! I'm there!
No. I'm just, I wanna, I need to be alone.
Have umm, have you thought anymore about you and Rachel?
Sure! Yeah! Las Vegas, number one!
Wow! I didn't know you guys actually used those.
You're also so generous and kind and scrappy!
No...I really wanted to know how you feel about it.
Hey, do you think this is why Chandler took off?
Ohhh! My God! For tiny salt!
No offense, but that sounds nothing like her.
Damn you Monica Geller hyphen Bing!
Ohh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. You'll get your turn!
You don't have to put a good spin on everything.
Hey, hey! Boo us? Boo you!
Oh, you won't believe who moved back to town.
What are people having, the garlic Martini?
No but you shouldn't! Don't ever do that again.
Wait, wait, remember when my water broke?
Oh, look! And we get these free t-shirts!
Oh, so they owe me like, three Phoebes.
Um, were you planning on kissing me ever?
Not even if you just pretend that it's milk?
Oh, you make sex noises when you get massaged!
Maybe we can like go to a movie or something.
Oh you did? He did it! He did it!
I don't know. I-I think it's still gonna be a while.
What time? Maybe we can share a cab!
Hi! Okay, Monica, Rachel, this is my friend Roger.
But, it's not like we're losing anything. Y'know?
You're right, you're right. Ah, you are so yumm.
Okay well, he would turn things to gold.
Ah-hah! At least we know it's a him.
Great, okay, what are you gonna change it to?
All right, so, what are we supposed to call you?
Ursula! Wait! Err-err, it's me! Phoebe!
Yeah, I really liked that fighter pilot one.
Maybe you need to spice things up a little.
I guess I dropped the ball there. Whoopsie!
Oh, I don't know, I don't know, isn't that a little desperate?
Y'know she might not even notice he's gone.
Nothing, I'm sorry, I'm just, I'm out of sorts.
OK, Monica? I had another answer all ready.
Okay. Oh my God! What did I ever do to you?!
Oh, I can't believe you guys lasted a whole year!
You see? Nothing is good enough for her!
Oh! okay. Wait, are we in Joey's imagination?
Yeah, and nobody slept with that Xerox girl.
I'll have one, please. Plus my money.
Hey you guys! Ok, we've got great news.
Umm, yeah, I'd like to go out with you officer...
Being pregnant is tough on your tummy.
Oh come on, they can be in the same room.
Yeah, I feel great. 'Cause we're moving in together.
Me too! Monica, do you think we could do it?
What... I could, I could do it. What is it?
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't hear you over all the winning.
So... now... What about with Mike's mom?
Oh, alright, that's it, now I have to go see him.
And do you know what girls are really good at?
Hey you guys I'm gonna go out and take a walk.
I'm sorry, I broke down... I wanted to see him.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm just a little nervous.
Uh-huh, and a little seed money for the party.
Yeah, but not as good as batch 17.
Oh that's good, the chemistry thing for us too.
You're not the only one who has a date tonight.
Oh, okay. Listen, thanks for everything, Mon.
And because you're both, you know, white women.
Yes, yes! Like the man in the shoe!
Oh Rachel, this is all so 'Papa don't preach.'
I can't, I have to take my grandmother to the vet.
Joey. You know, um, he's really nutsy about you.
Monica! That's not right! Start with where.
500 bucks at a flea market?!
Hi Geller-Bing residence. How can I help?
Yeah I know, it was my candle. My candle!
Is that a real place? Are they hiring?
Listen umm, yeah okay, I need to talk to you!
Whoa-whoa-whoa, you guys, do you know anything about chicks?
About 20 minutes. CLOSING CREDITS
Listen, sorry about your death, that really sucks.
Oh, we were just trying to make Joey feel better.
All right-Ooh! Oh dead God, save me!
So Chandler, I-I'd love to come by tonight.
So, Sebastian, do you do any volunteer work?
Oh no, let her stay out there. It's sweet.
Well, it's just that maternity clothes are so expensive.
Okay, this will keep them away from your stuff.
Just don't. Look at this funky shirt!
OK, so what, you're just never gonna see him again?
Cool Aunt Phoebe. I am pretty cool!
Uh huh. But they're not your friends anymore.
Come on Mon, let her throw the ball.
So-so how long did that last for you and Chandler?
It's fun, God I love how sexy I am.
'Hey! You're not dead! Okay, see ya!'
They're here already? How are they doing this?
Yes. Well, that's neither here nor there.
Great! Ok...I'll go get the tube top.
No. Here. There. Ooh, double sixes.
Yeah well, in America you're just an "ass".
What?! Oh my... Oh my God!! What happened?!
Seriously, I don't Rachel's gonna think it's a good idea.
Well, I bet that was very hard for him to do.
Hey! You were really great! You were really, really great!
But great news about the apartment pants, huh?
Ohh, okay, they gave you the old time pricing.
Okay, don't give me a reason to get mad, okay
Sting has a son that goes there too!
Oh, you like that? You should hear my phone number.
I just wanted to see what all the fuss was about.
Okay. If you're alive you answer your phone!
You can't put your cigarette out on a tree!
Hello Chandler, lovely day huh? You!
Oh no not that guy there. That guy right there.
And Tim I just wanna say, good luck here.
Oh, yeah, they're falling in love all over again.
Right- where we've been looking all night!
Not really, I got to drag him around too!
: Your Visa bill is huge!
How long has it been since you had sex?
Get your foot off my contestant! Judge!
Well, what am I gonna do? I really need my guitar!
Am I crazy or does this totally go?!
There is a speakerphone on the base unit...
Hey, thank you so much for these tickets, Chandler.
Yeah, I'll do that. So who gets to be yours?
Uh. It's not... quite what I'm saying.
Hmm, they just don't make 'em like that anymore!
Oh yeah you were helpful! Yeah, no, thanks you.
Well, Gladys say hello to your new home!
No, but it sounds like it was fricken funny...
Everybody, this is Parker, Parker this is...
Oh, all right. Oh! Look what we almost took!
Got it! It... It's hard to stop...
I suppose I could tell her it's just all my fault.
Oh hi Ben-No!! Don't look at the machine!
After that? Yeah! No, I mean if I can help.
I dunno. I don't feel like kissing anyone tonight.
I can't do that. I'm an actor. I have a process.
Not with that attitude! Now, haul ass!
Breaking up sucks! Oh, I really miss Mike!
Hey. I need an atlas! I need an atlas!
Umm, do health inspectors work on commission?
Yes you can! Sting says so himself!
That's so great! 'Cause you already know how to do that!
Come on, seriously! When did it end?
Yes! You mean the world the world to me. Oh...
Come on, give me something. What's his name?
Oh, how was last night with Julio, senorita?
You didn't leave lipstick marks on the phone.
See? This is exactly why you shouldn't lie!
And it looks like she put makeup on her!
Oh! The yuk! Ross, he's doing it again!
Ok. Listen, just don't say anything about me, ok.
Wait a second, or maybe you can go in first.
And! She uses sex as a weapon!
Ross! How could you do that to an old man?!
Yeah, we all know! We talk about it all the time!
Oh that's so great! Ohh, so what's going on now?
Ohh, I think she knows where my Dad is.
Doy! Probably right before she lost it!
Well then get your money back and return them!
I can smell it a little, bake the pie.
Oh, thank you! Oh... Oh my God, you're RICH!
You ask an intriguing question Chandler Bing.
Okay so, by melting, you meant melting.
Huh, I might be losing interest in this.
Fine! Here! Take a hike toots!
I just wish they'd realise they should be together.
Yeah, well me too, yeah. I think that's the challenge.
Oh God, Korea is such a beautiful country.
Wow! And hey, it's cool if you're a lesbian!
Uhu, uhu... and why do you think that is?
A-Allright, well... I'll call the cab company.
Ok. Um, so does your guitar have a strap?
Got cha again, you guys are so easy.
Okay. Come on! That's not running! Let's go!
You are really good! I play a little guitar myself.
If you could do that, I'd marry the hippity-hop.
But at least the apothecary table is real.
All right, forget it, nevermind, you can have mine.
Oh, Ode To A Pubic Hair?
No, no, no, no, no, no. Yeah, could I just?
Joey, why did you set me up with a stranger?
All right fine! This looks like so much fun.
Hey. Here. Ohh, who's the silver fox?
Oo, this is a big one. Eww! Arghhhh!!
Rach, it's gonna be okay! You guys are the best!
And to knowing that your career doesn't mean everything.
Ok, how about... uhm... sex or dinosaurs?
Okay, I knew I should have had this conversation with Joey.
This is my father, this is a picture of my dad.
Can you totally see through her shirt ?
Of course not, because you're in love with her.
Hey! What's up? Oh my God! What am I doing?!!
Why?! What's happening to the coffee house?! Oh!
Well at least I got these sheets for Ross.
Oh yeah, oh, she went to the salon alright...
Hey. Ooh Ross! How'd the conversation go?
Oh, I love paper mache! What did you make?
Do you think they have yesterday's daily news?
In my day, divorce was not an option.
Excuse me, Ross, old friends catching up.
You've lasted a whole year. Good for you.
You have a... You have a date? With who?
Joey, why don't you talk to Chandler about moving back?
So what do you guys want for an engagement present?
Okay, watch, learn, and don't eat my cookie.
Now, are you sure you don't want to go see a doctor?
Ok Rachel, make a special flan wish.
Awww! Now you're just my annoying friend Chandler.
You have to get a ticket to get past security.
TELL ME WHAT YOU KNOW!
Joey! Wow, you didn't rip off any buttons.
But somehow you came off as the bad guy.
...DUMB, DRUNKEN, BITCH!!! Thank you, thanks.
No, I felt it on my hip. You could tell.
All right, hold on! Okay, let's just all think.
Cassie, are you finding everything okay in there?
This is so fun. All right, what do we do now?
No, I think I can come over. It's Saturday, right?
Oh my God!! You threw Pepper on the fire!
Sorry, mix up. Hey, how was the movie?
Oh good! Okay. 'Cause you were acting like you didn't.
We're moving in together! Isn't it great! Yay!
Ohh, yeah. I think his exact words were...
Ohh! We went to a self-defense class today!
You were great. But they still made fun of you.
Y'know, you are 12 years older than her.
Ear plugs, or cloves of garlic?
That's a dog, every house should have a dog.
Well, some things are just hard to say to your face.
Oh my God! I can't believe my little brother is married!
Wow, Frank. I think we just ran out of kids.
Can't a girl finish a song around here?
No, now I feel bad. You wanna go to the concert.
Okay, yeah. Triple A can pick us up.
Okay, what did we say was your one gift to us?
How are you? Good. Hi, thanks for coming.
Thanks! Honey, would you want me to take your name?
Hey Joey, want come with me to... are you ok?
Oh, what was that for? Like a bake sale?
Never mind. But it was going to be really good.
Look, I'm talking right now! You're-you mean her.
Very good handshake, good wrist action.
Hey! Can we pick up where we left off?
Oh, it's incredible! I so want to be a Waxine girl.
Ooh, it's sympathy pains. Ohh, that's so sweet!
Okay, a meat eater. Fine, that's one for you.
Oh God. So-so you're making porn movies.
Oh, this life! Oh okay no, Chandler's is worse.
Oh my God! I don't believe it! Oh, you poor bunny.
Okay! All right! Yeah! 'Cause I just can't picture it.
Oh! I'm a masseuse. I give people massages and stuff.
Yeah, because you know what, it's... it's all about the children.
Ooh, where are you off to, Travelin' Jake?
Yeah that was lucrative! Smart like your brother!
Oh, it's like the mother ship is calling you home.
Who would you rather sleep with Monica or Rachel?
I can't believe you tried to move the green ottoman.
You didn't notice she was wearing different clothes?!
Let's try something else, let's play a game.
Oh, I thought you weren't coming. What? Where were you?
Could you-could you umm, give us one second?
Oh, well he's yummy. We did a little kissin'.
My songs aren't good enough for your restaurant?
I'm sorry, it's just, I'm a little short on cash.
Well, I have ah, vodka and cranberry juice.
Oh my God! Go away! Stop looking in here!
Alright, now I will let go if you both stop.
You mean the chocolate chip cookie recipe?
Okay. Oooh! Oh, this is our last huddle, yeah.
Okay! All right, let's start with the handshake. Hi.
Okay. Yikes! That one doesn't look very fulfilled.
Y'know! You don't make a very good first impression.
Well, they fired me and I'm having heart attack.
Ok, we're taking that paddle home, mister.
I don't. He got...he-he-he-he's hit by a bus.
...I feel a little sneezy And now I-
Well, if you really wanna know, I'm-Oh! I can't tell you this.
Hold me close, young Tony Dan-za.
Ugh. Come on, Mona, don't kiss ass.
Wow! Could everyone totally see up his robe?
But, also, what happened between you and your Mom?
You've got to get out of here! Save yourself!
Okay, Seasons Greetings and everything, but still...
Oh you'll probably take care of that on your hands.
Because it was fate that made me call you today!
I'm sorry, did you say all man or old man?
He went home. He didn't want to see anybody.
That's not Ralph Lauren. Sounds like him though.
Yeah, and I have a definite feeling it's gonna be a girl.
No, what's more important, your friends or money?
All right, me too. Should we wake her up?
So Ross, how umm, how did it go with Bonnie?
Okay, I will. This is my husband Crap Bag.
Yeah, after this, I think he'll be doing that himself.
Okay I can't let you do this! She's lying to you.
Oh Rach, good, listen isn't this perfect for me!
Uh-huh. You've met your match Rachel Green.
No, yeah! The groom cannot see the bride!
You know, I think I want to write a song about all this.
Shhh... This is the listening side of the wall.
She's gonna say goodbye to each of us individually.
Well, I guess they're not coming. You wanna just order?
Oh, you Americans always butcher the French language.
Ohh! Okay, I'm going to have to kick her ass too.
It's not all mine. We all get 50 cents.
Yeah. Salt, so your life always has flavor.
Ooh, great! Just the reaction I was hoping for.
No-No! You need your sleep. Night-night! Shh!
Oh my God, he's lost it. He's totally lost it.
Oh, well... 'cause.... you just... I don't like this question.
I will replace it, I promise. I feel so terrible.
All right, I guess I'll have to find a new bridesmaid.
Chandler sucks! He couldn't have gotten this good!
Okay. Okay, you don't have to walk behind me any more.
Um, yeah sure. Why you wanna call your Mom?
Of course they do! Or I'm just really hungry.
Uhuh, uhuh... Oh my God! This is really happening.
See, that just means it's working. Does this hurt?
Um, we went shopping for um, for, fur.
Well how would you know?! You didn't even read it!
I miss Janice though. "Hello, Chandler Bing."
Come on you guys, let's just do our own Thanksgiving.
Well just figure out a way to talk him out of it.
Yeah, I know, I do that 'cause it makes me look taller.
Rachel Karen Green, where's the other earring?!
I've never been more convinced of your love for her.
Oh, look, twins. Hi, guys. Oh, cute, cute.
Or you could stick a fork in an apple!
Ooh, ice! I am so in the mood for ice!
How long did you think this barbecue was gonna last?
Hmmm... No, no... No, I can't do this. It's bad.
well, this is, this is, this is not over! Hello?
Well, they may be a handful, but they're so cute.
Rach, so, that guy there. Straight or gay?
Oh, okay, see? Things are looking up already!
Hey! She will shower when Tibet is free.
He's just such a great guy I'm so excited about him.
That's nice. I like having things to read in the bathroom.
Do you want me to teach you? I'm a great teacher.
Ohhh... Sure, yeah... ..okay, it fits.
Come on Joey, don't make me feel badly about this.
Hey Joey, y'know what? You are way to good for her.
Oh. Okay. Oo, sorry I acted like a bank.
Make sure you check Chandler's jewelry box.
Oh yeah? Well, let's see. Ok, duck down.
All right, let just try it again. Really listen.
That's she's like the daughter she never had. Listen!
Rachel, we're sorry for pushing those guys on you.
Okay, obviously you don't know much about the U.S. government.
Hey, oh, so, um...how'd you make out last night?
She cancelled! My namesake cancelled on me!
Yeah! Oh, c'mere, Marcel! Oh, Marcel, c'mere!
Okay! Thanks! Happy Holidays, here's your joy.
See, this is exactly what we do not have time for.
Oh no wait no, this is wrong! Ross isn't here!
Ooh, what a great table! Where-where did you get it?
Ooh, look at you fancy lads. What's the occasion?
Chandler, I-I will handle this! How much is it?
All right, let's see, call me mrs Hannigan.
Hey! Hey, did you get your invitation to Ross's wedding?
Ooh, babies! Oh, this one is so cute, get this one!
Well, you could use your position y'know as the roommate.
Oh? And how will you know what time to come over?
Thanks. Okay, now go away so we can talk about you.
So you guys'll stay here and hang out with me?
Something just brushed up against my right leg!
oh umm Mike's picking me up for a date.
No, that would be, "Why are you being cute?"
If it was, would you stop hanging out with her?
Okay. Wait, do you know how you're going to stall her?
Wow! What an incredible violation-and wonderful surprise.
Umm, she said she'd be back December 26th.
Hey lady, your day's over! It's my turn!
And! Whoever finds it wins the prize!
Just wanna check my horoscope, see if it was right.
I'm having another heart attack!! Call 9-1-1!!
Oh, I wanna see! Lemme see! Lemme see!
Wait, wait! Get your coat! Get your coat!
Joey stuffing 15 Oreos in his mouth.
Wait-wait-wait, wait! Puppies. Cute or ugly?
Oh, I'm Phoebe Buffay. I'm one of Ross's best friends.
Wait! Maybe, maybe you're overreacting! You do that y'know.
Yeah, so... They gotta die someday. HELLO!
Wait you stole those from these people's wedding?
Ok well give her a chance to see all of that!
You saved them! You guys! Oh God, you're the best!
Well tell that to them. Oh! You can't, their dead.
Well you said that he's paying the people who are playing.
All right. I gotta go. I have break up with Vince.
Well, how-how-how is that possible? You barely know her!
Oh some guy from my gym. A little annoying.
What's that smile? Did something happen with you two?
Popes in a Volkswagen! ...I love that joke.
To see if know what these guys are talking about.
Oh my God, that's so freaky! Turn him off!!
You're the most beautiful bride I've ever seen.
He's not backing down. He went to get lotion.
Wow! You really go all out when you're expecting company.
But umm, I mean, did you talk to them about, y'know...
Well, not much has changed in the last five minutes.
That was the best part? Good honeymooning tiger.
Which would you rather be a fireman or a swimmer?
I'm almost done with it, keep your panties on.
Oh, my friend Sarah had a great time last night.
Oh, you guys! We've got to keep all the tickets together.
So, did shopping make you feel any better about Ross?
Yeah that's Rachel. Beat me over the head with it.
Uh Joey, we're trying to dial down the crazy.
Hey the wedding is so close! Are you getting nervous?
I know but I'm having so much fun doing good deeds.
Y'know, I dunno who this is, but it's not Debbie.
Really? Not even to, um, change his PAJAMAS?!
Oh, good, that's good, but you don't look like you were mugged!
So what were you doing out there, do you not like Charlie?
So um, so what's up, you came to see me yesterday.
Yeah that's right you are so busted. Book 'em.
Yeah. I just need you to bring me some photos of Ross.
You guys, I'm sorry, could you please talk a little slower?
Ooh, oh no! I have to go! I have a massage appointment.
Okay, good. There you go. Doesn't anyone feel better?
Ross, if you're this upset, you should go and talk to her.
I know, you must've won like a contest or something!
I know you're just moving uptown but I'm really gonna miss you.
Oh, look at little Leslie stretching in her sleep.
Yeah, y'know what, there are other fish in the sea.
Oh yes, I see what you mean. That look is priceless.
Oh, the Angelica!! Go! Go! You didn't get the annulment?!!
Oh, you say someone's name enough, they turn around.
Based on this play? ...Based on this play!
Embryossss? As in, "More than one?"
Y'know none of my other student thought I was stupid.
Of course you don't sweetie. You're brand new.
And Joey, get me a bottle of wine and glasses?
Ohh knockers will help us figure it out.
Uhm, no. I'm gonna have my friends call me Valerie.
Yeah, I know. It's a real mustard-tastrophe. Can you help me?
What are you two girls whispering about over there?!
Actually I said she abandoned me to write jingles.
He's right though, the '74 is absolute piss.
Wait. Really?! 'Cause mine get me out of tickets.
Hey-Ooh, how's Hilda? Is she working out?
Wow! Okay, dude alert! And who is this guy?
Oh my God, I remember now! We were playing chess!
Oh how lame... oh, it's so tacky, and impersonal.
Yeah it is! It is! It's freshwater eel!
So how is this for our big double date tonight?
Wow! Well, if you nail the interview, you'll get it!
Hey Rach, will you come with me to a dressing room?
Yeah, I might have said yes, but that would have been wrong.
Oh, boy scouts could have camped under there.
Hey. I'll be right back. I've got to go to the bathroom.
Okay. It's exactly how I'd imagined it would be.
You know... You're gonna be really, really hard to get over.
Excuse me, I don't want Greg and Jenny's rejects.
Wow! Nice! Manly and also kind of a slut.
Hey! You could do a lot worse than Joey Tribbiani!!
What? Oh. Ooh. Whoa! That one kept going.
I'm kind, caring, and sweet. What's Monica like?
I can say I told you so but she's kinda doing that for me.
I don't know. I haven't been out on a date in so long.
Oh, Boy Scouts could've camped under it!
Now do me, do my back. Oh come on, harder.
Hey! Do you want do you want a little taste of Pheebs?!
Oh! Joey uh, were you in our room last night?
Oh I know, I've been there. I remember toward the end...
Everbody this is Frank! This is my half-brother Frank.
Hey! Ooh, wow that jacket looks great on you!
Okay, I can do that! Oh, by the way, I love my office.
Oh, Rachel and I have appointments to get our hair cut.
Oh, hey, y'know what? Tell them that bone story.
That's right, I don't... But I was, I was drunk on you!
Really? That's the thing I'm worse at! You'll see.
Oh, yeah. That is not true. Ross, is this your fantasy?
Oh, hey, look, I found coffee! Okay, let's skedaddle.
Of course we can. Congratulations. Yay! Joey...
Yeah! Okay-ooh, but are you going to have time to read it?
Oh my God, you guys are selling the entertainment center?
Yes, hi, Mr. Adelman. Thanks for meeting me.
Eww! Oh, it's all dirty. You should throw this out.
For what? I can't believe this! I gotta get out of here.
That game should not be played without my supervision.
Yep, lipstick and a daughter, big day for you!
Well, I thought you loved her when you-when you married her.
Well, I mean, then what happens if it doesn't work out?
I can't believe this! How long as this been going on?
No, I really wanna live with you! I wanna move in with you!
Although he does play with himself in his sleep.
Look, can't we just say that you believe in something, and I don't.
Y'know, just some good faith money to hold the date.
Yeah, uh-huh, there was nothing. Can I get some water?
Yeah, do you want to break a dying woman's heart?
This is so typical. I'm always the last one to know everything.
But what about all the "finding-his-flaws" stuff we've been doing?
Okay, see, see, everyone else is happy she's done.
All right well, we're just gonna have to tell Monica, that's all.
Umm, no, it's a purse. And there's a thermos in it.
Yeah. So um, did he ever talk about me, Phoebe?
You know you should go outside and be with the three-dimensional people.
Um, a chip. A tattoo, I'm getting a tattoo.
Yeah, but you kinda knew that something was going on, didn't you?
Y'know, dirty talk, mnage trois, toys...
Yeah and I-I found you one too who is not a weirdo.
I didn't even think about that! Aaargh, sexual politics!!
Oh really? She said she wants to go away with you?
Get out of here you lurker! Go on! Get!
Yeah! No, that's right. And I thought it was a really good idea.
Oh, I tasted Ben's milk, and Ross freaked out.
Where is everyone? They're forty minutes late.
Oh, well, see, there's this guy she met at the...
We were just wondering if Chandler's girlfriend is a girl.
Yeah, well, y'know maybe you just need to try a little harder!
Ooh, ooh, fun! Okay... um, Liam Neeson.
Oh, in that case--Yay! That was me hopping on board.
No, I know. That's a part of the whole, you know, them-not-liking-you-extravaganza.
Well, no no, you have to stay back. I, I have the pox.
No I just, just wanted to know who he was, ya know.
Are these for rent! I thought people were just bragging!
Wow, kids. Frank, are you sure you're ready for that?
Okay then I don't have a choice! I have to buy that lamp!
All right, so promise you're gonna wait for her to call you?
Oh okay. All right, then I need to calm down a little.
Well actually, I know what time Chester and Marcia said.
He is! But he's getting divorced-Ross! Maybe you know him.
No, huh uh, no way, I'm sorry, not gonna happen.
Ooh, I'll go in on that with you! I couldn't think of anything.
Your welcome, oh please not the one with the turtles.
Oh! These are the ones I was looking at in the store.
Just for the future, this is hardly a commercial for it.
He said you poked at him with wooden spoons.
Okay. Whoa, sorry. Why were you just like all in the dark?
Yes! Yes you can, I'm looking for Jack's parents.
What's up? Tell Monica I'm sorry. Tell her yourself!
Well look no further, this one's yours! Ahhh.
Three? You guys were worried I wouldn't even have one!
So what?! That doesn't give you the right to ditch me!
No, I got in trouble for that before. I'll see you later.
No-no-no! We haven't started yet. Where's Alice?
Well, I'm not gonna be the only one who's not getting paid.
I can't believe he taped the two of them having sex!
So that's what you thought I did!! God! That's not what I do!
Oh yes, no, Richard would never steal your wind.
It's a Wonderful Life. Yes I've heard of this.
No thinking! No thinking! Tie or ascot?
Well yes Rachel but you got something so beautiful out there.
Umm, not without you, lover. So, this is my bra.
Oh, it's the compulsively neat one by the window, okay.
Wait, wait, I'm getting a deja vu...no, I'm not.
Wow! I didn't see that coming! You're-you're asking me out!
Joey's having a party and he wasn't gonna invite us?
Because, every time I go to the dentist, somebody dies.
We've got shoes being kicked off over here.
That wouldn't stand in the way of a true pianist.
So that's why she gave you a naked picture of herself.
yea you know you are a bit of a drama queen.
I'm sorry, I can't believe I set you up with such a MONSTER!
Alright Monica, if there is something that you would like to share...
Hey, maybe they meant to write, 'Quiet, bitch.'
Hey, does Monica know about her broken plates yet?
And that's Judy over there at the bar with Emma?
Uck, look at this! Pottery Barn, yuck!
Hey! Ooh, how was your first day working at the restaurant?
That's good. I got to admit, I thought it was something else.
This is nice. We never do anything just the two of us.
How could you not tell Mona that Rachel is living with you?
Are you sure? Because I'm really dreading going to this party.
Any chance Charlie has a deaf twin?
I would, but I get my morning sickness in the evening.
Well, I made you a candle light dinner in the park.
No you're not, you're wondering which cushion it is.
Honey, you've got to go. What's his office number?
Hmm, did you talk to Gary about the moving in thing?
Oh, totally. Oh, God, oh, she seemed so happy too.
Oh good! Because we have an "I'm sorry" song.
Thank you. No? All right. Oh, it's so nice to see you.
Why? The only person my playing is bothering is you!
But-but you know you cannot get involved with your assistant.
You should be. I'm very bendy. I'm gonna kiss you now.
Yeah, but I-I-I-I can do that for you, I'm gonna do that for you.
Yeah, yeah! And you can get rid of that French poster.
What? Is it - is this 'cause of what Ross said?
I think David would probably wanna hear a few lectures.
Oh, there's no such thing as an innocent burger.
She's made it pretty clear, it is not going to happen.
Oh please, somebody tell me I don't have to go to work today!
Well, I think you're gonna appreciate it the crap out of this one.
Do you think that's something that he'd be mad at you for?
Thank you for coming everybody. There're cookies in the back.
Oh, I'm sorry, the oven mitts really freaked me out.
Get away from that! No! She's just getting dressed.
Umm, when I get married will you be my maid of honor?
Yeah, um, which ones in particular were great for you?
Okay! Rach, hi, I need those earrings you borrowed.
Yes, I do! Today is Mike and my one-year anniversary.
My chest hurts! Oh, and now I-I can't breathe.
Somebody went to college. Wow. What is it? I'm sorry.
Yeah, it's in the guys' apartment under the sink. Why?
I'll be a fool for you. I'm sure, you know I don't mind.
Ok, I've got milk Here you go... Oh! Better?
I know, I'm sorry, please forgive me. I don't know what to say.
So, I just came from the company Ursula works for.
Well, I wanna enter her in a baby beauty pageant.
I did it! I took care of the babies all by myself!
Oh, good!Ok, good for you!Try to recapture the magic!
If you don't sail your boat, what do you do on it?
Okay, but you cannot tell him... but look whose back!
I went shopping with Monica all day, and I had a salad.
No-no-no oh, keep your name, don't take his name.
Oh, do you need a hug? You don't have to bring me anything!
Why would the copy guy say he was Ralph Lauren?
Hello grandma, if that is in fact your real name.
It's so inspired! Look at him! Look at him go!
Uh-huh, well! But umm, still I'm-I'm mad at you.
Well... Yeah. You look great too. Did you get a haircut?
Noooo!! Damn you ref! You burn in hell!!!
Oh, yeah, Bob said there might be flood damage.
See? I'm doing it. I am totally doing it. I lost it.
Well, I've never had it, I feel so left out. Oh look!
Well no, it was my fault so you should get the nice room.
Just a sec., we're kind in the middle of something here.
Yeah... That does sound great. I'm going to get the phone.
I didn't know where to put it so I just left it here for now.
Well, that would be great but then what do we do about Denise?
I'm just saying, this woman, I mean she's fictitious. No?
Excuse me, but umm, isn't he paying for your dinner?
Um, the matador. Ole, ha ha ha.
No, it sucks. I was saving up to buy a hamster.
But y'know what? It just seems that you two belong together.
Oh, Jason? Yeah, uh-huh, we're seeing each other tonight.
Okay, now you're just taking lines right out of the song!
Don't worry about me, I'm a robot! I'm just a machine!!
I think that uh, yours is a question with many answers.
Fine! I'll call Zurich and move some money around.
Why would you leave your Belgian waffle in the hall?
Well if we make it yesterday, woo-hoo! We're done!
Oh yay! Great! Okay, what room number is he in?
No, not Phoebe, Dr. Philange. Oh no! You have it too!
How could you say yes, what about our catering business?
Bras! We bought bras! We bought bras.
All right, I'm gonna go take a pregnancy test, right now.
Aww, and good luck to you too! What a nice lady!
Sure, I so glad we did this. It feels so good!
Yeah a little. He seems really nice. Good kisser.
Yeah but why didn't you just say that you didn't read the book?!
Chicken. Which is so ironic considering I'm a vegetarian.
Oh! Okay, that actually makes more sense. So how was it?
Still going through that dry spell with Carol?
Okay, this is inexcusable. I am shocked to my very core!
Look, I can't have a wedding with this money now. It's tainted.
Ooh, I have tasted my own medicine and it is bitter!
Nope. You don't want to see a face covered with pox.
And I just wanted a new daddy for Davy and Becky.
Come on, play that funky music white boy.
Oh hey! So, how did your doctor's appointment go?
Pumpkin? Yeah. But did he ever call you like, Budolph?
Don't make me do this again, I don't like my voice like this.
And we don't want any recognition. This is completely anonymous.
Ok, do you know how to go from D to A minor?
I know! But if I didn't work there, what else would I do?
No, but I like it. I think I left one of my rat babies.
Yeah, well, don't "Aww Pheebs, that sucks!" me yet.
Ooh, my first birthday present... ..oh, this is really...
What are you, what are you talking about? How did this happen?
Oh...you don't have to go, I have something that will fit you.
You keep the old ones in the back, that is so ageist.
Oh no, the Mendels, they hate all living things, right?
Umm, okay I would like to talk to you about your toner needs.
I don't know. They're so perfect for each other; it's crazy.
Yeah I guess you're right. Yeah thanks. This helped. Thanks.
Ok Mike, better come back Mike, better come back.
Yeah. Oh! It'll be like I have a wife in the fifties!
Oh, you just caught me off guard! Yeah, that would be nice.
No, that wouldn't kill her. Ordinary embolism might.
Okay, thank you very much, I'm gonna take a short break!
There-there was a suicide note?! Well, do you still have it?
Butterscotch? No one? All right, you'll be sorry later.
Well you certainly can't give her that stupid gumball ring.
Oh. Mine does. Stephanie knows all the chords.
Oh, no. Don't you hate it when people aren't there for you?
Ohh!! God! Ooh! Get out of here, good for nothing.
Oh all right, then I guess we're going back into the hallway.
What about her whining and her constant need for attention?!
Okay, yeah well, good news, you're going to have three babies.
Oh, it's so pretty. This must have cost him a fortune.
No, but would you like a thousand dollars and a football phone?
Okay, so after this audition, who decides who gets it?
I'm trying, but man that guy can push my buttons!
His first big kid's bike, this is so exciting!
Ah-ha! A classic sign of love, the hug!
Y'know, you're friend's getting married, it's gotta change things.
Well, his name is Parker and I met him at the drycleaners.
Well, if she isn't then cremating her was a big mistake.
It really does... how long do you think we have to stay?
Ooh, this is so exciting! Ooh, God, what are you going to bet?
Oh! Suddenly somebody knows all about the side affects!
I can't!! I can't!! Noooooooo!!!!!!! You son of a bitch!!!!!
He said: Are you seeing someone? And I said no...
So, how does Mona feel about you and Rachel living together?
Oh I got it!! Oh! Ew! Broken boob! Ow!
Oh, please! She's always got a broom in her hand!
Now wasn't Joey hitting on her at the wedding too?
No-no, it's okay. But are we sure we don't want the waterbed?
I know I am. That's why I can't wear a digital watch.
Oh good! Then you're in luck! Ben's not my son!
Okay, you have to switch with me! Monica is driving me crazy!
No but at Monica's you can eat cookies over the sink!
I, I have to go before I put your head through a wall.
Oh, no, I meant that it's weird that you only have nine now.
Whoah, ooh, why is the air in here so negative?
Will you excuse us, we need to talk for a moment.
That's true. Well, is anything you told me about yourself true?
Yeah, 'cause otherwise someone might get what they actually ordered.
Rachel Green? Son of a bitch, she came back?
No, no, I'm fine, and y'know why? 'Cause of all the riboflavin.
So why don't ya show us the rest of your casa?
I don't know. I'll just handle it-I'll ask you to talk to him!
What if I had taken that job at Merrill Lynch?
Not that way! But the bike brought you a lot closer!
Well, a palm reader, a manicurist, a hand doctor...
I would like to make a pledge. I would like to donate $200.
Come on Ross, you're a paleontologist, dig a little deeper.
Oh, he's playing organ for a children's roller-skating party.
Wait a minute, I see what's happening here. You're threatened.
I'm sorry, I'm just-I'm...I'm just not ready for a relationship right now.
I feel like my face is swelling. Is my face swelling?
He's just trying to show Joey how much he means to him.
I sense these things. It was either but or butter.
It's so weird, I have never been fired from anything before!
Oh! It ended okay. One of my friends shot him.
OK, hey, HEY. Is your boyfriend the boss of you?
I-I, came to fill your ice cube trays.
WHO DID YOU SEE HIM WITH?
Ooh, I just pulled out four eyelashes. That can't be good.
Wha..? Again with the nature, what are you? Beavers?
All right, I can't sit here anymore. I have to walk places.
Ooh, yeah. Then what are you going to put on top of that?
Really? So she said, she didn't wanna live with me anymore?
Okay. Hey Mon, why did you tell the guys you weren't pregnant?
Okay, I just thought of the perfect guy for Rachel to take to her thing.
Well, personally I think it's great you're giving yourself a break.
Ok, here are the birthday candles. Where's the birthday cake?
Ok, this is the most romantic disease I've ever had.
What?! You can't separate them! That's terrible. Which one?
You know, you are talking about one of my dear, dear friends.
You can drink a gallon of milk in 10 seconds?
Ross, could we please, please, please listen to anything else?
And all of the sudden his hands weren't the problem anymore.
Oh weird, Chandler just told us he's got a conference there!
Hey! Why isn't it Spiderman? Y'know like Goldman, Silverman...
No, you're too late!!! She already took out the trash!!!
Well umm, do you wanna get something to eat? I'm kinda hungry.
Remember how you said you were really dense about poetry? Oh.
Guess what. Frank Jr., and Alice got married!
Yeah! You know all those yummy noises? I wasn't faking.
Well, it was really sweet, and like the most romantic thing ever.
You don't need Janice for that, you've got us. We...
Oh my God Chandler, the one you picked is gone. It's over!
Let's see! Oh, you know who's great? Sandy Poophack.
Well, look, whatever happens, we're here for you and we love you.
Oh no! Not that guy! He does look like him though.
No you can't quit college! No! You're in college? Really?
Well isn't he your friend? Don't you want him to be happy?
Cute naked guy is really starting to put on weight.
Thanks a lot! I just got that jerk out of my mind!
Can I get you something to drink? Like a water and Valium?
Oh God no, I don't wanna see him take his clothes off!
...in you, my endless love. My endless love.
Well, he came in for a massage and everything was fine until...
Okay, it just seems pretty wild and you're so-y'know so...vanilla.
Na-uh, no, we are all responsible for our own babies.
Yes! A friend of mine did it and it's totally legal!
Come on Ross. We're sorry. Please tell us what it is.
Okay, so... allright... Which dress? You can say "neither".
Why couldn't you have just figured this out six years ago?
Yeah. But I also believed her when she said I was next.
That man across the street just kicked that pigeon! Oh!
Wow. So then did you make it with beef or Eggplant?
Yeah, and they've been coming by all day. They love it!
Okay, so now they know that you know and they don't know that Rachel knows?
Oh, my new Mom, who-who's a big, fat abandoner!
Oh, I can't believe you! You've been so good, for three years!
You know what, we're gonna have sex. Let's just leave it there.
What a great night, Chandler can't do it, these guys kissed...
Maybe the overlords needed them to steer their spacecrafts.
Happy, happy Chanukah, Chandler and Monica. Very merry...
Yeah... And that physique! You must work out all the time...
Are you gonna be embarrassed going up there having nothing prepared?
Well, I snapped! Okay? You weren't taking the class seriously.
This is going to be so much fun! Okay-shhh, I have to finish.
Can I please take these off? I swear I won't scratch.
No! You don't have to do anything! Just don't tell them that we know!
Hey! It's raining. I don't want to fly in the rain. So...
I can't have any. You know I don't eat meat. Ohhh no.
Okay, I will. But right after you tell me who the hell you are.
Well, the only thing you can do. Sleep with Ralph Lauren.
Oh, okay, it's the slide instead of stairs. Watch this.
Yeah. Oh, that's gone too. This is Monica's bathroom right?!
I don't believe you! That is...brilliant! And Monica has no idea?
My medallion number is, "Get out of the cab!"
My God, I can't get a minute of peace around this place.
Sting's son, seven years old and there's a picture.
Whatever, it's the perfect end to the perfect weekend anyways.
Oh yeah! I'd let him check out my kitchen floors.
Hello? What kind of bitch hangs up on a doctor!
Yes, 'cause now I have to go down there, and deal with them.
Yeah, Chandler why don't you take a walk? This doesn't concern you.
No, Joey! You borrowed my cab; you have to drive it back.
How come you're watching a rabbi play electric guitar?
I don't care. We're not paying you 300 dollars for this.
No reason! That would just be a really big surprise, right?
I am sorry. I am, but this wedding is just really important to me.
But, can't you leave the dollar? This money is for the poor.
It's not in the apartment? Oh no. I can't believe this is happening again.
Rachel? Patrick is really rich. Give her some money.
No it isn't, this is my dad, alright, I'll show you.
Yeah, and you have nothing to worry about 'cos they're all crap!
Yeah... All right, well that rules out Lana Titweiller.
Tomato tart and which of the pastas would you recommend?
Oh please, you are not gonna ditch again like you did with London.
All right, I'd better go too. I have to go talk to my dad.
You name one woman that you broke up with for a real reason.
No that's what you do when you want to get the truth out of someone.
Don't be so corny Ross, it's not an after-school special.
Umm, no, not at first 'cause I-I don't want to freak him out
Oh hi Rita! Good! Oh, Rita's a massage client.
What? Can't you see I'm in the middle of something? Ooh, I like it.
Wow! That's exciting, you went to Japan, made up a woman.
So great! Okay! Tomorrow we're gonna drive out to Montauk.
You too. And Ursula?! It was really nice meeting you tonight!!
Well, we just decided that Rachel is gonna be your maid of honor.
Wow! You're good! After this, we should solve crimes.
Oh! Here we all are! Yeah, there's Ross and Joey and you and me.
All right, stop it. Now you're just doing it to freak me out.
Someday I'll, tell you about the time I stabbed the cop.
Ameri-can. Y'know it's a very hard language. Let's do it again.
Monica, how did this happen? I thought you had this all planned out.
I'm so sorry! No I'm sorry! No I'm sorry! No I'm sorry!
Is it Ross? It's Ross isn't it-Oh my God, it's Joey!
David's like, y'know, Scientist Guy. He's very methodical.
Oh, anyway, they say, if we want, we can see it tonight.
Yeah, if you get married in Vegas, you're only married in Vegas.
Well that's only two days away. What is the other option?
Um, oh, I've got a birthday party, with some work people.
Oh no, ooh, ooh, did somebody forget to use a coaster?
I see. Nice sidestep on the do do thing by the way.
Well, if you don't want your mother to move in with you, just tell her.
All right, all right... I'll play if we don't keep score!
Oh, can I play too? I've never played football, like ever.
Aw! Hey, do you think that Susan person is her lover?
Oh no! That really is nothing, she is very sexually aggressive.
Oh. Well is she, is she the first that you've been with?
Or instead, maybe you could just not marry my brother Frank.
Well, he came in for a massage, and everything was fine until.
You guys wanna try and catch a late movie or something?
How about you less important people, let's open your presents!
Mon, maybe one of these guys wants to wear your dress.
No, we were talking about tennis. Tennis is more believable.
Oh, I'm going to give him something else besides joy, just...
I lost a whole year! I can't believe it! This is so unfair!
Oh yeah, the doctor said that could be one of the side effects.
I wouldn't bring that up, it would probably just bum him out.
Oh, thank you. I hope... I hope you know how much you mean to me.
Yeah, ooh, I like that! Yeah. Wait! How do you know about 'bah-bah-bha-bhan?'
Oh! I though the pot stickers were supposed to be vegetarian!
Oh, I don't know, I don't know. I think that's a little weird, y'know? Vinyl.
I know it's so exciting! You know I've never lived with a guy before.
God! Ooh! What is that smell? It's coming from the bathroom. Ooh!
Oh my God! I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Which one's Demi Moore?
We're just celebrating that Joey got his health insurance back.
Well, I just got off the phone with my lover, James Brolin...
I know it's le poo right now, but it'll get better.
Just from a, from a long time ago. Is he here?
We have got to get you lazy boys out of these chairs.
Well, okay, I made a touchdown. It was my first touchdown. So?
Oh no wait, oh no, the elastic on my underwear busted.
Stating the obvious, but thank you. And it's not weird is it.
No! No, we have an emergency. Okay? Rachel's coming to London.
Oh wow, ooh! Ooh, big step for Phoebe and Mike.
Okay, time to bring up the rest of the cups. Oh, hi Joey!
Listen to this! My reading was wrong, I'm not going die!
No! It's not a cigarette! The smoke is coming out of me!
Oh, I told the stripper to be here at five. That's good right?
Oh my God! You dated someone with a glass eye too?!
Yeah? And, he's-he's so centered and mature and confident.
Oh my God! That guy at the counter is totally checking you out!
Ross, how about you. What would you give up, sex or food?
Okay, okay, okay, okay... Still sure about me being myself?
Look, he gave me his night vision goggles and everything.
Speech! Speech! Let's hear from the birthday girl! Huh?
Yay!! Oh so, you're not, you're not mad at us anymore?
Ya-huh, all the time, cause they are the lightning bearers.
No I'm serious. I mean I'm intuitive, but my memory sucks.
I just can't decide who she looks more alike, you or Rachel?
Pies, oh, we thought you said priiiize . Here! .
No, y'know what don't close it 'cause the... keys...are in there.
Oh yeah! Yeah, no, we're gonna connect, y'know bond, and everything.
Hey, y'know what? My Grandma had the exact same bag!
Um, gram, um, can I see the pictures of my dad again?
All right. I'll do it, I kissed him before I can do it again.
Not unless someone borrowed it and left it at the gynecologist.
But Emma's got what it takes, she could go all the way!
Yeah, but y'know, about have of these are gonna end up getting divorced.
Oh, yeah, that's the word I use when I can't remember the real thing.
Come on! Let us be guys! Maybe we want to be guys!
Oh, thanks a lot. Do you want to get a cup of coffee?
Monica! We lived together for years! I've seen you naked!
Wrap it up, wrap it up, wrap it up...
No! Not the sex part, just the stuff leading up to it.
You just can't stand anyone else enjoying themselves can't you?
Umm, I'm sorry. Won't-won't Jack's father be joining us?
We didn't fool around with any of them. Dwha! Dwha!
OK, I wasn't in love with him and I was just helping out a friend.
HEY! Mike called were going out again! YAY! YAY!
Not yet. Umm, I heard they really hurt, do they hurt?
Oh my god, Rachel asked me if I knew anyone for her too.
Oh, Joey! Oh, okay, see I didn't recognize you wearing, in those....pants.
Hey, does anybody want to join me in the aroma room?
Yeah that's great! Next to that, Chandler won't look so stupid.
No..umm, could I talk to one of them? It's very very important.
I know, I just want to bite his bottom lip. But I won't.
Ok. Quick. We gotta find a cab and follow them.
Oh my god! Look, it's Ross and Rachel. Oh, the plan is working.
Okay, just tell me this, did you or did you not smell her hair?
I can't believe I still don't know what happened to the window in the attic!
Good. I'm really looking forward to you and me having sexual intercourse.
You're thing. You're thing. Y'know? You're the guy who gets divorced.
Okay, yeah, I'll see you later! Don't forget about the moving in!
Yeah, I see what you mean. By the way, nice Ross imitation.
If I let go of my hair, my head will fall off.
Oh, wait, let me get you another glass. That's been sitting out.
I know. But don't you think that it should be called Order and Law?
What's the big deal, y'know? It's not like it's a real marriage.
Oh I do, it's.... it's Bob Saget. She hates him.
Ooh! I thought of a good flaw! Ross pops his gum!
Umm, well I had a similar problem when I lived in Prague.
Oh, you're such a gentleman. Come on! We're going to my place!
Oh, you so would! Oh, you should get that anyway. Like for clubbing.
Why do you think, she's having so much fun living with Joey?
No, no, no! Don't call her! You wait for her to call you.
Is it me, or is veto starting to sound really good?
If you had to, what would you give up, food or sex?
Uhm, actually no. No, you've... You have to get off the plane.
Umm, well I sorta have some bad news, can I come in?
Phoebe. Phoebe. Phoebe, yeah. She named me after you I guess.
Oh-oh no she doesn't! I know what that is. You can stay.
I don't care, I've never won anything before, I can't believe this!
I can't help it. I need the meat. The baby needs the meat.
Duh, I think I know how to heat breast milk. Ok.
Shh, wait and see. Maybe we will, maybe we won't.
Yes, I did it!!! I nailed it!!! Yay! What's next?
Be cool! Okay lady, your lurking days are over!
I just-I thought you guys were doing it, I didn't know you were in love!
That's like the tenth time I've peed since I've been here!
Oh okay, well I'm a masseuse, and I used to work at this place...
It's interesting that you lost. Now, I forget, do you like to lose?
So, I decided I'm definitely going to go with either Joey or Chandler.
I didn't do it! It was Chandler! He's... He's mad at you!
Oh, you are so much the smitten kitten. You should ask him out.
Ooh that is definitely Chandler, Joey, or Ross. Or-or Rachel!
Uhuh. Because I'm a single mother, supporting my two children.
oh, well, Ross probably has it, you can get it from him later.
Uh, it's a piece of paper and it says, "Ross" on it.
Hey you guys, you will never guess who's coming to New York.
Hey Mon? Was it weird changing your name to Geller-Bing?
Y'know what, but there is, there is no right or wrong, here.
Okay, this kind of back talk is not gonna fly when we're married!
Oh, God, just do it! Call her! Stop being so testosteroney!
Oh my God Eric hi! Wait, how'd you get this number?
Be careful, be careful! These are my rat babies!
No!! Hey-hey that's not a Nutter-Butter, that's just an old Wonton!
Well then you'd better hurry! The Angelica! Go! Go!
Wait, what was that? That sounded like someone being nice to you.
Oh, I'm not gonna do this, okay? I'm not gonna eavesdrop on my friend.
Wow! I'm-I'm so happy for you guys. This is so-so, not stupid.
What a mean thing to say! I would never tell you it's not your birthday!
I need to talk to you, it's pretty urgent. It's about Monica and Chandler.
- and there's five hundred extra dollars in my account.
Hey is this true, that you write a lot of your own lines?
How - how do I get them to name the next one after me?
Okay, alright, you buy me a soda, and then we're even. Okay?
Ooh yeah! Then umm, what goes on top of the salami?
That is so smart! Break it off. Break it off now.
Y'know Rach, I think that, I think you should be Monica's made of honor.
Oh wow. What, do you think maybe he's gonna tell you that he's gay?
Oh my God! That's the creep that you're with at the Statue of Liberty.
No, you threw out Phoebe. I'm Ms. Regina Phalange. Phalange!
Okay. All right. Good luck explaining all the calls to China.
Rachel? Oh, good. Hey, by the way, did you just get on the plane?
I can't say that didn't hurt. But I'll take you back Joey Tribbiani.
I will tell you as soon as you thank me for writing my book.
Okay, I got a good one. Okay, umm, what is she? Like 12?
I have to tell you this story. Okay, I was coming over here and this driver...
No, we were just laughing. You know, how laughter can be infectious.
Yeah, I already have my bell and later on...I get my bucket.
Yeah, yeah but I am not sure about some of the bra's I got.
Well, of course I would want to see you. I...I think about you all the time.
Besides, it might be kinda fun to form the new A-Team.
If she's no fun, why do you want to date her at all?
You guys! You guys! You're gonna have a baby! They're gonna have a baby!
I have to tie my shoe, so you go ahead, I'll catch up.
You guys, there are people in there who are not getting any happier!
You're not? Then why did you ask us if we wanted to go?
What about my children Drake?! Huh!? No!! No!! No! God!
But are you saying that you would move out if I didn't buy that lamp?
Well okay but I have two tickets to the ballroom dance finals.
No, no, no. I'm sorry. It's "smelly cat, smel-ly cat".
Well, umm, my Mom's friend, Phoebe, is actually my birth Mom.
I was going too. Umm, I brought some wine. Would you like some?
Anyway, I just wanted to say thank you, it was just, it was so sweet.
Oh, yeah. Could be Rachel asking if someone could baby-sit again.
It's such a shame you can't see which finger I'm holding up.
That's a really nice gift. I was thinking of like a gravy boat.
It's gotta be better than that book. Oo! Like a crossbow!
Okay, oh, and Emma needs a cowgirl outfit for the competition.
Build the unit Cinderelly, lay the tile Cinderelly.
No thanks, I have a good one too. I just, I, I can't see him.
Chandler, you called Janice! That's how much you wanted to be with someone!
All right, that makes sense. Ugh. But-Screw you I'm going first!
Not especially. But you know what, I think they had pot in them.
Monica, can I talk to you behind my menu, please. What are you doing?
Hey, I never got to hear who you guys would pick to be your girlfriend.
He-he does not like it! He hates it! He's in pain!
Hey, Joey, when you said the deal with Santa Clause, you meant?
Fire alarm? Oh! Hi, officer-fireman, can-can I help you?
Really? That's so sweet. I mean, I'm officially offended but, sweet.
Well, maybe it won't work out. Maybe Ross won't like her personality.
Yay-oh-yay! Okay, I gotta go tell Frank and Alice! Right now!
Okay, I hear you! Are you capable of talking about any thing else?
Oh, thank God, 'cause that thing's really creepy! Look, there's Chandler.
What a neat idea. All your clothes match. I'm gonna do this.
Wow! See, and I didn't think you'd be able to come up with anything.
Yeah, you don't wanna live in Westchester. That's like the worst of the Chesters.
Oh no, none of them are the father. The father is my brother.
Yeah, you know what the best part of it is? I get to do my "plan-laugh."
Okay. Listen, I'm sorry about before. Do you have anything her for $10.
Okay, and then this is the coffee house. This is where I play my music.
Oh, interesting you should call me that! Now that I may never have one!
Yes... I'm sorry, I've never met a boyfriends parents before...
Well, you could wait 'til I go to the dentist, maybe I'll kill him.
Well look, if I wanted to see a fireman, I would date one. Okay?
Smelly cat, smell-ly cat, what are they feeding you? Everybody.
Uh-huh! Why do you think it takes me so long to answer the door?
One really does have a stick up one's ass. Doesn't one?
Well, who cares what your Mom thinks? So you pulled a Monica.
Okay, don't worry, I'm just checking to see if the muscle's in spasm...huh.
No! Look-look! There's the coffee table they stole from us!
Yes I did! Meet: Princess Consuela Banana Hammock!
Because a promise between friends means never having to give a reason.
What a sad little life she must lead. Okay, ooh .
Yeah, so, he had a really funny hat-I don't want to talk about it.
Hey oh, Rach wait! Do you want to go to a movie tonight?
I know I'm not, but you are, and I was trying to spare your feelings.
Hey listen let me ask you, do you believe in soul mates?
Monica, you might want to remember that you are married. Where is Chandler anyway?
Yeah, it all just came screaming back to me. So how's the game?
Oh, you're right! I was just kidding about Rachel. Babysitting is a gas!
Yes, it was! It was him! Uh huh! Okay, it was me!
Why? Just 'cause you're too lazy to get up off your touchie?
Uh oh, ooh, are we not getting along with the new boy?
OK, here I go. . . here I go. . . I'm goin'.
Oh my God, everything is such a mess. Why is this happening to me?
Oh did you-what did you-did you work for two days straight?
Joseph! Thou needn't worry, they shan't be long.
God. Do think it really doesn't hurt? 'Cause how can they do that?
Yeah, yeah, he talked to her, but she got on the plane anyway.
If you never smoke again I'll give you seven thousand dollars!
That's ridiculous Rachel, we were all babies once. Oh, you mean today.
Oh, come on Will! Just take off your shirt and tell us!
Wait, I'm-I'm sorry. What's the big deal about a holiday card?
Happy Christmas Eve Eve. Oh my God, where did you get this?
I just, I just have this really strong feeling that this cat is my Mother.
Fine. But you can't help me develop my new universal language.
Oh! I knew it! I knew it! I felt really thick this morning.
Yeah. Hard Ass and Wuss. We could fight crime!
Yeah I mean if you want to say anything to her, I'd tell her off.
Oh, well, don't tell me you want to keep more of your stuff in my uterus.
No, no actually, he's smiling.. and... Oh my God, don't do that!!
Ohh, umm, we kinda took a little detour on the way over here.
Kyle's ex-wife? You were supposed to divert her not date her!
Yeah, yeah. He deserves to do the thing he loves one last time.
Great, all right, okay, and Monica ask me to make the drumming stop.
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm so rude. Does anyone want to come to the movies?
OK so isn't there a little part of you that wants to get up there?
Oh! Well, what kind of emergency that gets us both out of here?
Because the more I drink, the less there is for the kids to drink.
Wait! Wait! Hi! Listen, Ross can I just talk to you for just a second?
Oh my God!!! Monica!! He's the stripper from your bachelorette party!!
Oh no, one of those 'look for the hidden meaning' songs.
Oh, it's your audition from this morning. Can I use the phone again?
Oh OK. So, um, the cat stinks but you love it, let's go.
Ooh, hey, could we put on the news? I think it might be raining.
That is unfair. I'll call her and tell her it was totally my fault.
Umm, I...I just think you don't expect someone so hot to be so sweet.
I know, I want that too, but IS that going to make it too hard?
Dive. Yeah, they dove head-first into fun on the farm.
Mr. Bing's office. No I'm sorry, he's in a meeting right now.
Umm, I lost one of your earrings. I'm sorry! I am so, so sorry!
Oh no!You guys aren't supposed to get divorced for 7 years!
Hey Rach, what time do you get off? We're all gonna do something tonight.
Oh before I forget, are you coming to Mike's piano bar tonight?
Yes. We're here to make a rather sizeable donation to the children.
My mom never gave birth. Oh! But my birth mom did.
Wow, that's great! I liked that better than the law thing, so...
OK, fine, if it means that much to you I'll get rid of Bob.
Oh that's my grandma. And thanks Joey she's having a really great time.
That sounds really great, but maybe you should be in charge of wiping.
All right. . He is a good guy. You're right, he wouldn't cheat.
I'm in vice. Yeah, in fact I'm undercover right now. I'm a whore.
What the hell is this, herbal tea? I hate herbal tea!
I... I cannot believe Ross even made this list. What a dinkus.
So, what did Rachel say when you told her you were still married to her?
Ohh. Oh wait! you guys won't be late for my dinner, will you?
Okay, enough with the third degree! I-I've, I don't live here anymore.
Ok, ok, how many of you enjoyed the music outside? Ha!
Yeah, 'cause hello, these are not her boobies, these are her breasts.
Hey. I'm so excited; I just set up Rachel with the worst guy tonight.
Oh, god. So adorable. Look at them sleeping there like angels.
Ooh, ok, that's it. Enough with the keys. No one say keys.
No it's not great. No, she's coming to tell Ross that she loves him.
Oh my God, it's all so elegant! When's the dirty stuff starting?
Uhu, uhu, well, then, great. If you love it, I love it.
Oh! Oh my god. This is so exciting. How much am I gonna get?
But on the southern route there's a chicken that plays tic-tac-toe.
Well, I think I broke it. But that's all right, here's the number you can call.
Okay-Oop! Too late! I'm leaving! Come on Chandler let's go!
Yes there are! There are totally good deeds that are selfless.
Hey you guys, Hums While He Pees just asked me out!
Oh ok, Ryan, that guy I went out with, who's in the Navy.
Okay, maybe it was a trick question. Um, Rachel can we do this now?
Ohh, that's so nice! How great! Well, where? Where's the trip?!
Hello, Hello. Ohh, OHH, she knew I could kick her ass.
No, I mean you break up with Janice and I'll break up with Tony.
Why?! You two are so meant to be together, everybody thinks so.
Fine. All right, I'll give you one pointer. Look out for that bitch.
Why would you start again after chewing all that quitting gum?
I think so too. And that little flap? Great for holding my lipstick.
Well, I've got to get out of this bed, I'm going crazy here. Crazy!
Sounds like somebody wants to be Mr. Pizza Delivery Girl.
Yeah, no, I'm fairly intuitive and psychic. It's a substantial gift.
You guys are so pathetic, I, oh, OH, XANADU! OH.
Right. Or you might get everything you've wanted since you were fifteen.
Yeah, that does make sense. Ok, now, would... would you two like that?
What the smell from Joey's? No, I can hardly smell it over here.
Oh no! No-no! I understand the pain! Don't-don't hurt the puppy.
It will be...in a minute. Listen, Tim you're a really great guy.
Sure! I feel so bad for you; I broke my leg once too.
Oh, well get in line missy. So, can I have a ride stud?
Well, if you don't... if you don't hold it in, you don't get all the nutrients.
Why? It's fun, it's different, no-one else has a name like it.
Um, the off-Broadway play people said 'You were pretty but dumb.'
Are you kidding? People acting like animals to music. Come on!
Gooood luck! Gooood luck! We all wish you good luuuuuuuuck!!!
So, now, Rach, this is a traditional English trifle, isn't it?
Who's cell phone is that? It's just so annoying; everywhere you go.
Yeah, we should get a move on if we wanna make those dinner reservations.
Oh. Ew! Ew! Ew! Ugh! Y'know what? This is too weird.
Oh yeah-No, she was really nice to me, but she's in hell for sure.
Um, yeah, you want Ursula, and I'm Phoebe. Twin sisters! Seriously.
I got married! Could someone get me a coat, I'm freaking freezing.
No, I know what a silent is I meant, what's going on with your hair?
Joey, can I have a sip of your coffee and a bite of your muffin?
Why don't you go up there and ask him to 'step lightly, please?'
Ohh, you guys, remember that cute client I told you about? I bit him.
Well, how about a compromise then, okay? What if it's like y'know, Chanoey?
Yeah, but, y'know, it's... it would be like starting on the fifteenth date.
That's all right, I'll work here. This is goo, next to this plant.
Oh well, I guess Italian isn't one of the four languages you speak.
Yeah, but did they have to shoot him down? I mean, that was just mean.
Of course! Yeah, I was uh, umm Thigh Mega Tampon.
Oh, I don't make them a lot because I don't think it's fair to the other cookies
Oh my God!! No! What?! Help me! Let me out! Now!
Oh, no umm, hi, that-that, you have to put that out, 'cause I'm pregnant.
Yeah, I know. Oh, good thing it's one of those 801 numbers. Right?
I gotta call him. Just to talk to him, there's no harm in that.
No, only the three of you, any more than that and she'll get suspicious.
I think he's right. You guys hang out at the coffeehouse way too much.
Well, what am I going to tell Monica? She wants to wear them tonight!
Ooh! That's a good one! Mine is to pilot a commercial jet.
She untied his G-string with her teeth. Somebody stop me!
Oh, I'm sorry. But I really like this guy. And I think he really happens to like me.
They live on the upper east side on Park Avenue!
Yes!! Yes!! I'm the next caller! You were gonna have me hang up.
Y'know what? We thought you were different. But I guess it was just the coma.
Okay, okay, but Rachel's gonna be here too, can't I just ask her this stuff?
Okay. All right, this is my favourite part of the weekend, right now, this.
Ok, Love Story, Brian's Song, and Terms of Endearment.
It's too soon to tell. She's resting, which is a good sign.
Like crop circles, or the Bermuda triangle, or evolution?
Well, if that's what they do in Minsk... In New York... it's...
It's just my knitting that's all! Yes! I knit this. I'm very good.
Oh, well what are you doing here? Are you about to do it? Is it Gunther?
I got it from your maid. She's a bitch, but I wore her down.
Uh, hello, this is Ross Geller's personal physician, Dr. Philange.
Okay, we have like ten minutes. Do you want me to get into that now?!
Yeah. I really hate to give her up. Oh, I know!! Oh, you should take her!
Because my psychic is dead! She must've read the cards wrong!
David! What-what are you doing here? Aren't you supposed to be in Russia?
Fine! Then you tell Roger because he was really looking forward to this!
No! No!! It's me! It's me! I-I didn't want to make any noise!
Are you sure? I'll bet there's another flight to Minsk in like...
Okay. Okay! Well okay, who do we know that's coming? Me. Are you?
Yeah, and these are my friends. People. This is Vince, Vince the people.
Oh hey, Monica, I heard you saw Donald Trump at your convention.
What? He's gonna be dressed as a baby! Oh hi Mrs. Green!
Oh, he's at the doctor, he didn't poop the whole time we were there!
Yeah, but only a genius would swallow a sonic blaster gun.
Y'know I'm-I'm sensing that um, my grandmother would not be comfortable with that.
No I'm having fun. I'm really-And I'm really-really excited for you and Ursula.
So, Scott asked me to come over for lunch today and I did.
Wow, I have the spirit of an old Indian women living in mine.
Wow, you guys go way back then. So what are you up to these days?
I brought a bunch of stuff for the house, so check it out. Ha-ha.
Ok, right there. That, that's the third sign today. Right there.
Or, we could not tell them we know and have a little fun of our own
Oh, I was telling them about you and Emily. Y'know, try to get some sympathy.
Hey, don't call him that! His name is Spackel Back Harry!
That's short for Phoebe?! I thought that was just what we called each other!
No, no, Mr. Heckles no one is making any noise up here.
Well I don't, I don't have a mother so often I forget that other people...
Rosss can! Give me the tickets! Ross can give me the tickets!!
Okay! Hey! What do I do?!! What are you doing? Did you find the dress?
well it was awful every time I thought about what you said I started crying.
Ohh! Oh my. Oh, that reminds me, I have to see my OB-GYN today.
All right, we'll se you and Mike at the restaurant in a couple hours.
Why are you guys so upset? It's Old Yeller, it's a happy movie.
No reason, it's just I know a single guy that cares about other people.
Oh, oh sweet Lord! This is what evil must taste like!
That's sweat. You throw up all morning, you'll have that glow too.
Come on! You can drink a gallon of milk in 10 seconds?
Hey everybody, Rachel was so good today. She didn't gossip at all.
Now, wait a minute. So, they're gonna name their first child Joey?
Umm, this stuffing is amazing. Do you think we should bring them some?
That is so weird! I had a dream that you'd have lunch with Richard.
Wait, if that's his favourite area, why is he being so mean to it?
Shocking! Let's play the game of who can stay quiet the longest.
I don't know. But, God, Joey seems to be handling it suprisingly well.
Wait a second! This is about the fourth month of your pregnancy, right?
Me too! Oh! Did you ever see An Officer and a Gentleman?
Oh that's all right. I'm still full from your homemade potato chips.
Oh, they're just gonna umm, look to see if my endometria layer is thick.
Oooh, is daddy getting angry? Is daddy gonna spank me?
Eww, look. Ugly Naked Guy lit a bunch of candles.
Oh my God! So was she! Oh, I've got-I've got goose bumps.
Okay. Oh but don't tell them Monica's pregnant because, they frown on that.
I can see that. A plate of brownies once told me a limerick.
I can't! My circuits are fried! They're fried I tell you!!
Alright, here's my $7.50. But I think you should know that this money is cursed.
Um well I don't really. Just genetically. He's kinda my dad too.
Oh no, no. I can't choose between you two! I love you both so much!
Hey! Umm, well, only okay because I just got back from, from the hospital.
And I'm still waiting for my paper mache man. Thank you my babies.
Which-which sister is this? Is this the spoiled one or that's bitter?
There it is! Oh, look at that! Isn't Mother Nature amazing?
No!! wait, wait, wait!! Oh please, hold it up so I can listen.
Oh wait, oh I forgot... and uhm... I love you... and you have nice eyes.
Um, I'm getting a lily for my Mom. 'Cause her name's Lily.
Uh, uh, gimme. Can you see me operating a drill press?
Oh no, Rach, no no, you know you're never supposed to wake a sleeping baby.
I'm starving. I know we were coming here tonight, I ate nothing all day.
Okay, ask her 'What is her current method of birth control?'
Well, maybe he wouldn't be she didn't bring the office home every night!
Unless! She wants to spend the night holding my hair back for me.
Great! Okay, if you'll just excuse me. So, did you hear something you liked?
So-so you two were married huh? What happened? You just drift apart?
Oh down please. I-I hate to be a ball buster can I just do it?
No way! No way! You just broke with Tag a week ago.
Or, we could not tell them we know and have a little fun of our own.
Oh right, yeah okay, my Mom could, and I can't. We don't have that....
Uh, wow! Isn't it ironic that he liked you and now you like him?
I'm-I'm just saying, don't freak out until you're a hundred percent sure.
Fine! But please God; tell me how to stop them from going off!
OOOOOHHHHH! Fine, I can't take it anymore! I'm putting an end to this!
Thousands of times!! That doesn't make me sound too good does it?
Listen. Listen. Smelly cat, smelly cat, what are they feeding you?
Okay, what is this? A stupid contest? Because we got a winner here!
Okay, so we got some more good rejections, lots of stuff to work on.
Also uhm... I just want you to know what a wonderful man your son is.
Yeah, I know, Frank. I counted them when they were coming out of my area.
Yeah! So--ooh, I gotta ask you though. How did you know where to find me?
So weird, you think he's so gross and you're willing to eat his crackers.
You know, the strippers, and the guys dancing, and you know, pee-pee's flying about.
I don't know, he just started kissing me. Get him! Get him, Vince!
I know her! I bought homemade soap from her at a Dead show!
It's hard to believe that just a little while ago this was nothing but ingredients.
Sure you can! Give them some blocks, put them in a playpen!
Aw. I'm just-I'm in a place in my life right now where I...I...
Or...or we can chant and dance around naked, you know, with sticks.
You mean the-Okay by siadic, you mean the towel covered portion.
It was really fun, I mean I've never talked on a car phone before.
Well, maybe it's so big because the house was built on radioactive waste.
What about Ross? What about your moment? Don't you want to talk to Ross about it?
Would you relax? I know what I am doing. This is how he wears it.
Go, go, go Alan! Run you, hairy bastard! end.
Absolutely! Y'know, you get this rush of feelings, but then it goes away.
Oh, god, the last time I babysat them, they did the funniest thing..
Hey, oh, you know that guy who's been following me? I talked to him today.
I know. They should be a family. They should get married and have more children.
Well, I can't give you a massage, because my licence has been revoked again!
It's so weird seeing Ross and Rachel with a baby. It's just so grown up.
That's easy for you to say, I don't see three kids coming out your vagina!
Ooh, that is silly. I'll go up there, I'll tell him to keep it down.
Oh that's good, I guess she'll have a choice between my guy and your weirdo.
Well, since the fire was kinda my fault I guess you should get to stay here.
I mean, I know Joey is not my boyfriend, or my thermos, or anything, but...
But really, it does seem like this money could be put to better use?
OK, that makes no sense. Why would the villagers worship a pharmacist?
Is it okay if I leave this stuff here 'til Rachel's birthday party?
OK, I smell smoke. Maybe that's 'cause someone's pants are on fire.
All right. Although I don't think we need one, I never stopped loving you.
Um, then yes, it's 'cause of Phoebe! So, you know, it's either her or me.
Hey, have you seen Frank Jr., 'cause he's meeting me here with the triplets.
Oh, okay, yeah. I put your stuff in her room, and her stuff in your room.
All right. If you care enough to make up that load of crap, okay.
About twenty, a couple people from work who had something else to do.
You're so much more than just brains! You're sweet, and kind, and funny...
Oh yeah, no-no-no. I'm fine. I'm okay, but umm, my Grandma sorta died.
Mike, let me ask you something. How many sisters does Joey have?
No-no wait-wait! I can't just let you hang up! Just please talk to me.
Does a dog's lips move when he reads? Okay, no they don't.
Well speaking of chiming in, remember the time you burned down my apartment?
Chandler, your being here is the best Christmas present I could have ever imagined.
Oh yes. Yes. Yeah-no. She did. She left you umm, this lipstick.
Why, I must have been in missile training the day they taught that.
Ok, great! All right, bye! Pain in the ass!! That's off, right?
Okay, fine. Come dinosaur, we're not welcome in the house of no imagination.
Have fun. Oh wait, no, don't! I forgot I am totally against that now.
I just thought we might be here for awhile. You know, things might get musical.
You guys, we've been waiting for you for a long time, maybe you should order.
Uh-huh. Oh, yeah, I could write about the time my hair did that "Woo-hoo" thing.
Okay, okay, okay, the black. But, oh, do you have black, with the little strappys?
Toll-booth! Four bucks. There are quarters in the glove compartment.
I've already stuffed a bunch of Brussel sprouts down his pants.
Yeah, I wanted to call and tell you that there's no hard feelings for firing me.
It was the end of the party, you were probably ironing wrapping paper.
Hey, do you realise that at one time or another we all lived in this apartment?
And no, oh please, oh please let me finish. Oh I guess that was it.
Where'd you get too? We lost you after you opened up all the presents.
Okay, all right, so, your in a meadow, millions of stars in the sky....
I think she means 'You dance a dance class'. Oh, c'mon, c'mon.
Ooh, Atlantic City! Oh, that's a great plan! Who's plan was that?
Oh I do! Oh, y'know what? No. Wait a second. I know it's in here somewhere.
It's not a stupid gumball machine looking ring! It's a beautiful ring!
Wow! Big day huh? People moving in, people getting annulled...
Well, lots of people! Look, are you coming to memorial service or not?
You've have lipstick right here . That's okay, it's mine, we just kissed.
I was preparing you for my-didn't you think I was dead? Did that not come off?
You didn't bring one! My cab's downstairs, I'll drive you to the airport.
Okay, okay. It's James Brolin. James Brolin is the father of my baby.
Yeah! Sure! Ooh, I left my purse up at Monica's. I'll be right back.
OK. OK, alrighty, let's play some tunes. Hi everybody, I'm Phoebe
Ah, it's been so long, so long. I can't believe you're still doing this!
You ask us to find you a guy and you come traipsing in here with your own!
Yeah, but did you see the dents in his knuckles? That means he's artistic.
What, he's not still following her. Do you think he is still following her?
Just for some short-term-work. You know, until I get back some of my massage clients.
Ohh, you are so lucky! Hey! So, where's Monica? Did you guys make up?
Because, I'm just, I'm incredibly anal and an unbelievable control freak.
Yeah. We don't speak. She's like this high-powered, driven career type.
We found your test in the trash, if you're not pregnant--It's because I am.
Well, you're not more excited than I am! No way! I'm the most excited!
Umm, Rachel and I were just discussing it and she had some very interesting insights.
Yeah- no- I'm just- it's, I haven't worked- It's my bank.
Yeah, much better. And you know what, don't feel bad, because it's a hard song.
Okay, now's not the time Joey. All right? You can yell at me tomorrow.
Hey, it's your Thanksgiving too, y'know, instead of watching football, you could help.
I'm gonna find a selfless good dead. I'm gonna beat you, you evil genius.
Ohh! Oh, the Chelsea Reporter, ohh, this used to keep me so warm.
Don't feel too sorry for me. At least my boyfriend isn't gay.
No, I can't talk to you! I don't have a fancy ad in the Yellow Pages!
I had nothing to do with it. Okay, it was my idea, but I don't feel good about it.
Oh, there's a cab! Taxi!! Good timing, my God, huh? Here you go.
Well, he may not be my soul mate, but a girl's gotta eat.
I know. I know. I know. I know, and if you try to make it more you might wreck it.
Oh hey Ross oh I'm so glad someone's here could you zip me up?
Hey, why don't you guys go, get portraits done by a professional photographer.
Oh!! That's my new thing. I figure bodies at peace, make peace.
Well, you're not, You're not... you're not... again, you're not SPEAKING FRENCH!
Oh yeah it is! I'm going to the movies and it starts in like five minutes.
As a masseuse and a human, I'm begging you, never do that to anyone!
Hi, yeah, hi! I'm umm, Phoebe Buffay, and I have babies coming out of me.
What's the matter with me? How do I keep ruining this? I'm sorry, I'm sorry!
Good! Oh yay! Let's get down to business! Emma needs some makeup!
Another amazing find! Wow! Oh I bet this has a great story too!
Oh, okay I didn't get that message. So this doesn't count-Anyway, I'll be in my office.
So Theodore... I uhm... I can see where Mike gets his good looks from...
Yeah. Its just, you know, its this whole stupid Ursula thing, its...
Listen. You are not going to believe this but, that is not me singing on the video.
You can't fire him and dump him the same day, he'll kill himself.
And maybe I could teach Ben about the Christmas skull and how people die.
No! But it's the nicest kitchen, the refrigerator told me to have a great day.
Because you'll date her once, sleep with her and then forget she exists!
I'm hearing what you're saying, but at our prices everyone needs toner.
All right. Oh! Shoot! Oh shoot! Uh, Rachel wanted to see this tape!
Yeah! It's not like it spits out a Clark bar after every game.
You're welcome. And thank you for "Science Boy". I learned a lot from him.
Oh, I know! "Oh...I slept with Billy Joel". All right, who hasn't?
Rach, Rach, I just remembered. I had a dream about Mr. Geller last night.
Ooh, God, it's him! It's that cop! God, I can't believe it! He found me!
Uh huh! If it's a girl, Phoebe, and if it's a boy, Phoebo!
Okay. And, my, dead, mother, says, you, are, it. I'm with Rachel.
Your kid is seven?! He's really small. Please! Please get the tickets!
I don't know, it would totally depend on her coloring and... You got the job!!
C'mon Mike, you can beat her! Knock that dog off her head!
Alright. I looked all over the building and I couldn't find the kitty anywhere.
You don't know him. It's not important. He wants nothing to do with me or the baby.
You guys, you know what I just realized? 'Joker' is 'poker' with a 'J.' Coincidence?
Oh no. Could I get anyone a coffee or...poison? No? Just for me? Okay.
Oh no... Have you thought about it how complicated this could get? What about Ross?
Oh okay, well I'm sorry to bother you. Bye-bye. Yeah you're right, this is easy.
Oooh look! Isn't this adorable, Ross let Ben address mine!
But there's a whole table of mini-muffin baskets. Which one did you send?
Hi, I'm Ben. I'm hospital worker Ben. It's Ben... to the rescue!
It's Lafite. The '74 Latour is actually drinking quite nicely.
No, she just died today! Okay, umm, we're having a memorial service tomorrow.
Oh, no no, that side doesn't have one, the paramedics had to cut through it.
In the cab, on the way over, Steve blazed up a doobie.
Yeah! Here! Oh no, these are the trick deck. Okay. Here yes. Okay.
Listen, Robert's gonna be here any second so, will one of you just tell him?
Oh you're my biggest fan? I've always wanted to meet you! Hi! Sure! Yeah!
No! No! It's just that he gave me three tickets and there are six of us!
Um, well, Max told me about Minsk, so congratulations! This is so exciting!
Yeah but if we throw her a party on her birthday, then it's not a surprise.
Yeah, I had a date with this guy, and I swear to God, he is her other half.
Okay! Ooh-ahh, I'm gonna go pack. I'm gonna go pack my ass off!
I know! Monica's gonna have a baby! Hey, can this count as her something new?
Well, she told me that I'm gonna die this week, so I'm kinda bummed about that.
Why? Because she can sing and play guitar and do both at the same time?
Oh, I'm just so exhausted from dragging around this... HUGE engagement ring!
No-no, it'll be fun! We can come back and we can haunt these guys!
Oh, well, then you'll have extra seats, you know, for all your tiaras and stuff.
You don't have to lie anymore, Ross, I know that it was a fourteen year-old girl.
Um, no, huh-uh. One of my clients died on the massage table today.
Oh Chandler! Thank God you're alive. Monica, can I talk to you outside for a minute?
Oh, it's a key. To be honest, I think I'd prefer the five dollars.
Oh yeah, I'm sure. And all of a sudden his hands weren't the problem anymore.
After applying the Waxine and linen strips to leg number one,
Yeah we thought it would be nice to use the fancy china for dessert too.
So how's your date with your cyberchick going. Ooh, hey, what is all that .
Yes! They called and you didn't get it! Okay, I mean you didn't get it, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Oh, yeah! Back then y'know, we called the Great War. It really was!
Why, do I have a feeling that's not as happy as it sounds? No! Nooooo!!!
"No time for losers, 'cause we are the champions of the world...!" Thank you!
It's ok, it's ok. I made my decision. What I really want is a great big wedding.
All right. Hold on. I got it. Nickel! How much more do we need?
Or we could use it to call China. See how those guys are doing.
Oh, yeah, oh, I'm sure of it. You should just do it, just sweep and throw me.
It's not like we-we know each other or anything. Or that have anything in common.
Ok, so, ok, was he holding you? Or was his hand like on your back?
Can you believe this. In, like, two hours I'm gonna have a dad. Eeeshk.
Okay, remember that little problem I was having during my fourth month of pregnancy?
I love you too. Please don't... Don't turn into... you know... French bitch!
I'm sorry, but I just wrote the best dance song for your wedding. Check this out.
So how are things going with you two? Is she becoming your special someone?
Y'know you guys were a lot more supportive when I wanted to make denim furniture.
Yes. Definitely! Yes! Let's live in an apartment that we both live in!
I'm sorry, Ross, this is my old friend Lowell from the streets. Lowell, Ross.
Okay, I can fix this! Okay Monica, Rachel thinks all you can talk about is the wedding.
Joey, I just think you're getting worked up over nothing. This is probably just a crush.
Wow! It's huge! It's so much bigger than the cubicle. Oh, this is a cube.
What? What? You guys, what is going on? You not like Robert? Why are you laughing?!
Yeah, by the way, good luck in your next life as a dung beetle.
Yeah, okay. Hey, wait. Do you know what kind of birth control she was using?
Well, not so good. Upstate's pretty big, he's pretty small, you do the math.
You know, maybe she was just really spent from our talk. It was pretty intense.
Yeah. And believe me, this suit does not do justice to what's underneath it.
Oh hey, you guys, look! Ugly Naked Guy is putting stuff in boxes!
Ah-ha! Okay, Las Vegas 1, London 0! I'll be right back.
Wow, Mike Hannigan...You sure know how to make a girl say "Hell yeah!"
I have new respect for Chandler. All right everybody! It's time to open the presents!
I got it for your wedding and I ordered it weeks ago, and it finally got here!
Hey, guys, you know what Larry would say? He would say, "See you ladle."
I KNOW THAT!!! You have to stop her!! She's going to ruin the wedding!!
Mhuh, guys, that means the world to me. Huh, nkay, I'm gonna take off.
I'm Rachel. It's so annoying when I put Emma on the phone to talk with my friends.
I dunno, well he got over the "We were on a break" thing really quickly.
Oh, look! There's Monica and Chandler! Hey! Hey, you guys! Hey! Ohh!! Ohh! Ahh-ahhh!!
But, I need your germs! I want my cold back! I miss my sexy voice.
Oh yeah? Well, tell me which one, and I'll try slip it in my coat.
I think she took it pretty well. You know Paolo's over there right now, so...
But, let's play this one first. And remember whoever talks first loses!
You know if you want, we can sneak the dog back in and Chandler wouldn't even know.
It's very weird! I don't want some guy down there telling me, I'm y'know, dilatedamundo!
What are the chances? 1 billion Chinese people and they send Mike!?
Oh, ooh, Soap Opera Digest, oh that's one of my favorite digests.
So wow, it looks like you took care of everything. Thanks a lot, co-host.
Oh hey hi, he's doing it. He's breaking down the door. Okay, we're in.
Oh, Ross, Mon, is it okay if I bring someone to your parent's anniversary party?
Yeah, no kidding, this just proves no good can come from having sex with Ross!
Sorry Frank, I'm kinda in the middle of the last favor you asked me to do.
That's odd, 'cause this dog's been living here for the past 3 days
Hang in there, Man With Eye Patch, your tray is coming!
"Oh, I have to get my number back. Oh my God. He's gone." Dead on.
Okay, you said I could sing at your wedding so, I'm just gonna need a small deposit.
The donation we made earlier, we k..., we w..., we want it back.
Yeah okay... yeah, your mom... okay... She looks nice, I can talk to her.
Oh my God. This is where you got all our stuff, Pottery Barn! Oh my God!
Oh, wait a minute it's not gonna be Baby Girl? I thought that was so original!
Of course, yeah. You know, a kiss on the cheek wouldn't be totally inappropriate...
All right, well I just wanted to say thank you though for diverting Kyle's ex.
Umm, you might even say that she pulled a Monica. She doesn't know we switched it.
For what it's worth, we would have caught her if we were at the right airport.
Well, he's never coming back! Okay? You just cost me eight dollars a week!
Hello handsome. Oh God. Oh look at you two. So when did you guys meet?
My guy is a lawyer who has volunteer work. And, he has one of these
: Dear Ms. Green, thank you for your inquiry, however... oh...
Ok, so now we need, um sage branches and the sacramental wine.
That is so cruel! Why? Why would a parent name their child Bethel?
Because I just didn't know how much I wanted it. And I love you, and I wanted to live with you.
Yeah, and what a great way to say, "I secretly love you, roommate's girlfriend!"
Oh, poor little Tooty is scared to death. We should find his owner.
I have this feeling that something's wrong with it. Something is wrong with the left Philange.
This isn't a good deed, you just wanted to get on TV! This is totally selfish.
Yeah, yeah, no, I don't, I don't know. But, y'know what, maybe it's just all for the best?
No it's just that I got this new pager and I have it on vibrate. See ya!
Or you could teach stripping. You know, share your gift, pass the torch.
I can't. I can't believe I have plans, I can't. Can you do it tomorrow night though?
Yes! I will have the green salad, umm the house salad, and water's fine.
Wow, eight hour flight with a one-year old? Good luck, mom.
Hey! You guys, I'm writing a holiday song for everyone. Do you want to hear it?
Until then, General Grant, why don't you set up camp right there.
Well, I would love to but...the bike got stolen and the police have no suspects.
Yeah, I thought I had one a couple of minutes ago, and now I know that was definitely one.
I can't believe you won't just admit it! Okay, just promise me that you won't do anything stupid.
Well, it seems like there weren't any tears 'til you showed her the bill.
Well, there was this one kid who had a sticker on his backpack that said-
Woo-Hoo! The curse is broken! I called everybody I know, and everyone is alive.
We're so stupid! Do you know what's going on in there? They're trying to take Joey!
No no no, doggie please. Oh, I do so wanna love all animals, please no.
Hamburger. McDonald's. Old MacDonald had a farm, my dad is a pharmacist.
Y'know what, you should like, you should buy a state and then just name it after yourself.
It's not mine, I didn't earn it, if I kept it, it would be like stealing.
Okay! It's worth it, if it will get you moving. You haven't worked in months.
No! Wait! I was just saying that so you'd think I was a good person. Fight for me.
Terry's a jerk, and he won't let me work, and I hate Central Perk!
Yeah, I did. I think it sounds y'know big sistery, y'know, 'Frank's always late.'
Alright you guys, we can't turn on each other, Okay? That's just what she wants.
Well, of course it smells really bad. You have your head inside a turkey's ass!
That wasn't a date! That was, that was just friends getting together... having sex.
Phoebe, just watch that, I promise it will resotre all your faith in humanity.
Smoked a joint? You know, lit a bone? Weed? Hemp? Ganja?
No they ran out of "It's a girl" but I can fix this one, See?
I don't know. I mean, she obviously has some kind of unfinished business. Sit up!
...so this guy was all And I'm all, Buffay, Homicide. It was just so cool!
I think my boyfriend ever so dreamy, I wonder what our wedding's gonna be like.
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. If you... If you want your key back, I totally understand.
After he passed out, we put the sand around him to keep him warm.
Well I don't think it's very nice of you to park here, y'know you're blocking the entrance.
So, how are things going with crazy? Has she cooked your rabbit yet?
Well look-look, okay Ross, Kyle just told me some really bad stuff about her.
No, yeah, we never find them! She's always best at us that wily minx.
Yes, you will be very sad. All right, well I gotta go tell Rachel the good news.
No, no maybe 'cause it's harder to raise them, and the added expense, and...
Did you, did you touch any of the guitars while you were there? Did you?!
You know like... uh okay... uh... 'Could that report be any later?'
Well I'm sorry Rachel, but I'm not like you, ok? Not everyone can afford help.
Are you lying? Is this like that time you tried to convince us that you were a doctor?
Yeah, her first day on a new spiritual plane and she's gonna come to the coffeehouse!
What about, what about when I said y'know about the apartment pants, how dumb was I?
Which means she had a couple spritzers and a quick peck on the cheek.
Ross, you're tired. You've been looking all night. And clearly you suck at this.
I'D Better Go. Just Over Here I don't want to miss the fight.
And this time, they've ganged up to form one giant, super hat.
Just, 'cause, I don't want her to go through what I went through with Carl- oh!
No, it's not! We were just goofing around and I dared him to try them on.
Good. Oh oh! Roger's having a dinner thing and he wanted me to invite you guys.
Oh, okay. Excuse me sir? Could you come with me please? You have a phone call.
A little mirror that when you look into it you see yourself as an old woman.
See no-no, I made a batch and I froze it, and this is the only one left.
Y'know what? I'm not talking to you! You go back to sleep! And you, are you a rapist?!
Okay, look I-I-I do something nice, okay? I'll-I'll fill her ice trays.
Okay If you guys have microphones in there too, I didn't mean any of that. I love you.
Well actually you're the one person I can't tell this too. And the one person I want to the most.
I'm a lady Monica, I don't kiss and tell. But this hickey speaks for itself.
I'm telling you, if you want to take care of that thing, you should go to my herbal guy.
A-ha! And... what is bluffing? Is it not another word for... lying?
Ooh, is it someone in this building? Is it that tall guy from the first floor?
Yeah, yeah, no it's OK 'cause, I mean, I know he's there, so, that's enough for now.
Ooh, I gotta go. I found a guy that who could fix up the van for catering.
Or, we can decide by whose ever name is closer to the word phone.
Ooh. Oh. It looks like, like a tiny little person drowning in your cereal.
Well, we were um, sorta invited to go skiing, y'know Rachel's sister's cabin.
Come on, you know, Thanksgiving. Ooh, you got the bigger half. What'd you wish for?
Maybe because you never listen to anything that I say. I talk about her all the time! DENISE!!!!!
All right, well, I just can't think about that right now. I just wanna say good-bye to my Grandma.
This is completely normal, around the fourth month your hormones start going crazy.
Ice sculpture? That sounds really fancy! I told you I just want a simple wedding.
No! Seven rats! I think we should take them home, we need feed them.
Yeah, um, she was 82 years old. Her name was um, Mrs. Adelman.
What when Yeller saves saves the family from the wolf and everyone's happy?
We just have to really, really, really, not let stuff like money get--is that a hickey?
Rachel has something that she wants to tell you and umm, I believe that this is your red sweater.
Yeah, well, we'll see about that. Can I use your phone? I just wanna call everyone I know.
I know no, no, y'know you don't deserve this, you don't Ross. You're, you're really, you're so good.
Wow, a house for dolls, that is so cool! When I was kid, I had a barrel.
Yeah the material feels so soft-hello Mr. Bicep! Have you been working out?
Thank you. Can you believe no-one between my apartment and here offered to do that for me?
Yeah you're always singing "Yummy yummy yummy, I've got love in my tummy"
You know, it's a lot less surprising to do that after I've buzzed you into the building.
Thank you! God, no! You should see me when... Oh actually, no, I look pretty good.
No, the 'No Smoking' sign. There's no smoking in my Grandmother's cab.
Oh OK. Oh no, oh it's gone, that's so weird, I don't know how-where it went.
Would you stop already? Get out of the bitter barn and play in the hay.
All right. No, no, no, not a Richard thing, just put down the glass. And get out!
No! I'm not finished yet! Don't! Don't you dare hang up on me!!!
It's amazing! My headache is completely gone! What are those pills called?
That's funny, no. Cadillac, cataract, I get it, no I get it, you stay out there.
No-no, I know that, but I just have to make enough money for the second part of my plan.
Um-mmm, and I won't have to go there anymore because I gave them my correct address.
I know. Oh, like you would drink her coffee after what you did to her with Van Damme.
Or! I should rush through dinner with Joey and I can meet David at 9:00!
Wait. Why was he yelling at her? He's the one who slept with someone else.
Yeah, and-and leaving us to go see hot dancer girls is not very Thanksgivingy.
Ok, I didn't see it, because I was putting on my jacket, but I uh want to believe you.
Tiger! Dragon! Iceberg!! Joseph, did you even study at all last night?
Wow, money and a firm hand. Finally a Chandler I can get on board with.
And then. I would use y'know the strongest tool at my disposal. My sexuality.
Oh! Here it is! Ooh, Joey! Why did you sign it, "Son of a bitch?"
All righty. I'll be back in-in a little bit. Unless you wanna come with me?
It's a video of my friend giving birth. Could you just bring it back to your apartment?
No, listening! Sit! Y'know, maybe it would just really, really help if you would just talk.
Oh wait, I change my mind! Okay, let's talk about the party! I have so many ideas!
Yes, and her boyfriend. But we're celebrating Thanksgiving in December 'cause he is lunar.
Yes, they are expected presently. Yeah, yeah um, their arrival is in the offing.
Well, you said that you had customers lined up in the street, so I am here to entertain!
No, yeah, we never find them! She's always best at us, that wily... minx.
Uh huh yeah there's just something umm, there's something you should know Vicrum just called.
Okay, so when you're done with your tea I'll look at your leaves and tell you your fortune.
Wait a minute! So when Emily comes you're just, you're not gonna see Rachel anymore?
A stripper at a bachelor party, that is so clich. Why don't you get a magician?!
Wait for me! Wait for me! Wait for me! Oh cool, this is my first huddle.
Yeah, I... Well y'know I-I mean I missed the-the semi-finals, so I'd just be lost.
There isn't time. You must leave everything. They'll take care of you next door.
I'm not going along with some lie you made Ross, No I'm just gonna be honest with him.
Yes, and I'm sorry. I-I know things worked out for Chandler and Monica, but that's very rare.
Yes. Yes! Fine! I am someone! You want me to say it? I have doubts! I'm sorry!
Oh, I took Larry there to eat but it was all violated. So we shut it down!
And on my way over here, I stepped in gum. ...What is up with the universe?!
Yeah well, she certainly knew what she was doing New Year's Eve 1997.
Not if nothing happens. Why can't... why can't we just hang out as friends?
No, nothing like that. I was just...such a dummie. I taught this "massage-yourself-at-home-workshop." And they are.
Oh God, I'm so glad you guys are happy, I was so afraid you were going to be all freaked.
Well, 'cause then they'd be like my mom used to make them, you know, before she died.
Although... it's also about the wedding... Ugh, alright... here. No... Oh God... Oh!
Yeah, I think it was better when you guys were sad. Hey, uh, remember the roller blades?
I don't know, they both want to live in a house of cheese! I don't know how you fight that.
Okay Joey? Chandler's here, he was wondering... Okay, I guess he ran out of change.
Will it? Will it?! I mean, how would you feel if you found out you were 31?
Hmm, something bad to tell Rachel... Bad news for Rachel, what could that be?!
You'd better get back in that kitchen Monica, the garlic is not gonna overuse itself.
So, what are we gonna do? Are we just gonna go ahead and set them up with people?
Yeah! Let's do it! Let's live together! Oh god, we're really going to move in together!
Uh, Ross, those are the only lines we have, sorry. OK, you guys, once more.
No! No! Look at that! It's a line of ants! They're working as a team!
I'm just gonna pass on the concert, 'cause I'm just not in a very Hootie place right now.
Okay. Okay but you should know though, I've raised my rates to $200 an hour.
Oh? Isn't that funny? I didn't see that before, I wouldn't have let her go up again.
Sure! Tout le plaisir est pour moi, mon ami.
Okay. Oh no-no-no, you don't touch the guitar! First you learn here, then you learn here.
Listen! You have to help me pick a dress 'cause I'm meeting Mike's parents tonight!
Oh! Which can either mean you're having a baby or you're gonna make a scientific discovery!
OK, I just need two... the, um, ten of spades and the six of clubs.
nothing, I'm excited about our date, Mike this is Ross Geller this is Mike Haaaaa.
Oh, you are so going to Minsk. You belong in Minsk. You can't stay here just 'cause of me.
Ok, you guys, I don't mean to make things worse, but umm, I don't want to live with Rachel anymore.
Of course you can take a couple days off work because this trip includes me!
Fine, all right, mine had a dwarf that got broke in half, but y'know whatever.
Yes! Now, she feels terrible! She really wants to make up! You gotta find her.
Okay! Oh my God! My first bike! Thank you for the best present I've ever gotten.
Are you ready for your Scottish massage? Put your face in the hole, lassy.
Yeah. So, we can do it tomorrow night, you guys. It's Valentine's Day. It's perfect.
Damn it woman, pull yourself together! Have some pride, for the love of God.
God, I woke the beast. Sorry. I was wrong obviously, I just-I misspoke. It's okay.
Hey you guys, I don't mean to make things worse, but umm, I don't want to live with Rachel anymore.
Ok, well, who identified the tone of this restaurant as pretentious comma garlicky?
Uh-huh, got it. Ooh, I'm gonna see my dad. Wish me luck, Grandpa! Commercial
Oh, did the little rich boy have a problem with the butler? Yes, mine's worse!
Okay, well I think that they're in my purse. Why don't you go get dressed and I'll look for them.
Oh-ho yeah! A song with rhyming words. Oo, I never thought of that before.
I bought them off Ebay! They used to belong to the late Shania Twain.
Wow, this is it, I'm gonna meet my dad. This is like the biggest thing ever, huh.
I'm on top of the world, looking down on creation and the only explanation I can find...
Ugh, it's so exhausting waiting for death. Ohh, by the way, do you think you could-
Oh! I know! It's because... he's gorgeous, and he's charming, and when he looks at you...
Oh, I knew something had to be wrong, because my fingernails did not grow at all yesterday.
Oh, ok, murder, cancer, soccer teams eating each other in the Andes.
Yes, thank you. You see, this is how normal people are supposed to react to drums.
Good that's a good one. Okay, Monica, anything? Y'know? Does Rachel move the phone pen?
No, I'm-I'm not sure about Hulk, but I like the idea of a name starting with "The."
Oh, this is so exciting! You get your picture back up on the wall of fame! Eek!
Aw, and I was gonna ask you to marry me because I forgot to say hello to you last week.
Yes, I was going to incorporate that. Oh good, here's Monica, she'll have something nice to say.
Ahh, toilet seat covers! Is that what you were doing while I was getting gas?
Yes. Once. Yeah, a little. He kinda did it to himself. It's not really a good story.
Wow! Oh you can just imagine that this is where they kept all the stuff to make their potions.
Some guy bought it. I'm sorry. I tired to stop it but they put me in jail!
All good, thanks. Do you maybe have a nickname have like a nickname that's easier to rhyme?
Well, I think it's great that the medical community is finally trying to help sick hamsters.
You're Elizabeth's father, huh? I can see now where she gets her rugged handsomeness.
Yu-huh. That's when my mother would shut off the TV and say 'The end'.
Yeah, well, I'm very angry at him, because he slept with me and never called me back.
Hello "ja", it's time for your massage, ja! Put your face in the hole.
Well, how could it not be breezy, no, 'cause, you're, you're in such a breezy place.
Hi. Y'know in England this car would be on the other side of the store. Woo!
Alright, don't say that. He's probably always been dull. You just, you know, set it free.
Huh. So now, the real question is, who put those fossils there, and why?
I can't believe I'm gonna have a party! This is so great! A party! Yay!! I don't know why.
Oh well, all right, I got thank you, I got uh, this y'know "I want a job sweater."
Oh! Get off!! Ow!! Oh, stop it!! Why?! Why are you doing that to me?!
Um, that's ok! Ok. All right. Now we need the semen of a righteous man.
You don't have to do that, Ross and Joey aren't here, you can watch the parade if you want.
Oh, do I have a middle name. All right Monica Velula Geller. It's that bedroom there.
No! No! I just went to pick up Phoebe Buffay's checks; there were a lot of them.
Oh God, here we go. For the first time in my life I'm gonna say 'Hi birthfather'.
Hey, you guys! Look what I found! Look at this! That's my Mom's writing! Look.
I know, I'm sorry! But y'know, this ring is better! Monica never even saw the other ring.
Yeah... but you should know, I also have a jar of vaseline and a cat skull in here.
Oh.Okay, then it gets worse, 'cause then I told him that I would see him tomorrow night.
Oh, so this is all about money! Y'know it's bad enough that-Ow! Oh, you have got to be kidding!
Oh. It was a long shot. Hey, you guys can I just like have a second alone with the babies.
Oh, no, no, no, no. You know what, he's not into that stuff anymore. He quit for me.
You apologize to the tree right now or I am calling for backup. Backup! Backup!!
No! Think about it, it's a taxi that people take when they need to relax, it's...
Ok, so... 1800 minus twelve is... one thousand, seven hundred and...
Was it my work? Were they mad? Was it Jack? Did he yell?!
Just one? I drive you all the way down here, and I don't get to see how it works out?
G-sharp? Have you been studying the real names of the chords? Have you? Oh my God!
Oh my God! Why would you play hide and seek with someone you know is a flight risk?!
I can't say, I just thought it was really good... and... maybe would be worth something some day.
Oh, it's already closed, Chris gave me the keys to lock up-what is wrong?
A bunch of stuff. And the worst one... he wants me to get rid of Gladys.
I know that, but look, we've got the Powerball number, we've won 3 dollars!
We've got the ground-up flesh of formerly cute cows and turkeys, ew...
Its fine. I mean, this is something that you've been thinking about since you were what, 14?
All I could think of was y'know, "Is he gonna kiss me? Is he gonna kiss me?"
All right I... I gotta call my mom and ask her a left handed cooking question.
Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs!
Okay, is this the day of good news or what? I got us a job! The wedding reception.
Okay. But the question is who's gonna go first. 'Cause whoever goes second is the bitch.
Stop it! Stop it, before someone gets really hurt! Here David, you should just go.
Okay. Ooh, I see a ladder. Which can mean either a promotion or a violent death.
You knew this and you never said anything?! With all the stupid dinosaur stuff you tell us?!
least you've been married, OH MY GOD! I wanna trade lives with Ross.
No that's just me coughing! Oh, good, there you are! Listen, um, I have a dog in my room.
Oh, and great! You might as well bring me my book, it's on the counter in your apartment.
Okay, dinosaur attack!! Quick, everybody into the house!! Ahh-ahh! Roof! Rrroof-roof-roof!
That woman at the game didn't know what she was talking about. Mike, obviously you have balls.
No. No! No! ...So, um, do you think he's doing any better than he was this morning?
I can hear traffic and birds! I can hear the voices in my head again! I'm kidding.
I've had that dog there for three days and Chandler had no idea. He's not so smart.
What does that mean? Does he sell it, drink it, or just complain a lot?
When I got pregnant with the triplets, I took that test like three times just to make sure.
YOU DID NOT!!!! Oh! No! You came up with Relaxi Cab! That's not good.
Oh. Well umm, okay here's a weird thing. My mother was also a supply manager.
Yeah, I saw the article on your coffee table and I memorized the title to freak you out!
Because patience is the road to understanding which ... is the key... to a happy heart.
Oh, hey, Mon, do you still have your like old blouses and dresses from high school?
Happy thirtieth birthday! Here! It's for the child in you, and the woman. Happy thirtieth!
Y'know, for once, I am going to sit down and try to watch one of these things. .
No. They said you 'Weren't believable as a human being.' So, you can work on that.
This used to be your room? Wow! You must've been in really good shape as a kid.
Oh, but, could we not go together? I,I don't wanna be the geek that invited the boss.
Yeah, I can see where I'd be your best shot but, no. I'm sorry, but I think it's twisted.
Yeah. But Sergei said it took the Germans six weeks to get all the way across it.
Ooh, this is cool...it says in some parts of the world, people actually eat the placenta.
That's the same month as Halloween. So, um, what kinda things do you like to do at home?
Um, not so good. He walked me to the subway and said 'We should do this again!'
So, so far is this trip to Vegas better or worse than the trip to London?
So he's probably really nervous around women, y'know? Maybe, you just have to make the first move.
Okay, so what do you think ladies? Who wouldn't be interested? Who wouldn't want to date him?
Ooh, three points. Both fine answers, but we were looking for leafy, leafy.
I do! I do! I do! I do! Ugh, like I can really chase you. I'm carrying a litter.
Okay, fine, I'll move. Alright, you don't have to manhandle me. Where? Okay. Thank you. Wach.
Oh. Oooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! My butt cheek is waking up! Oooh! Ooh!
Umm, wow. This-this isn't gonna be easy. Umm, I don't think we should see each other anymore.
Yeah I know. Isn't it great? One less person we have to make small talk with.
I really don't want to mess up what we have. I'm just-I'm worried it's gonna be a big mistake.
Then he comes over! "I'm so worried about you." Uck! Be a man!
It's, yes, my little black book. It's got the numbers of all the guys I've dated.
Hell, I'm drunk right now! What? I can't have a mimosa with breakfast?! I'm on vacation!
Oh no, I know! I know! It's the one where Joey got Monica's turkey stuck on his head!
All right well let's see, Ross is a good father, but Joey has a boat-This is hard!
All right, I already didn't give them back to you, that's what I said. Where is that other earring?
Well, okay, fine, use my happy place. Okay, I'm just gonna, I have to ask that you don't move anything.
No, I just heard when people live together, they split the cost of stamps. Don't they?
Did you ever feed him a poison capsule that made him bleed from the eyes?
Oh God. Remember the girls' nights we used to have sitting around talking about you and Ross?
Thanks, hi. Um, I wanna start with a song that means a lot to me this time of year.
We were at the game, and this guy proposed to his girlfriend on the big screen thing...
Eh, don't be so hard on yourself. If someone I was still in love with was getting married...
Oh, it's a secret. Oh goodie! Yes! We haven't done the secret thing in a long time.
He said, "Nice to meet you Glenda." Well, obviously I couldn't give him my real name?
You're just so mean to each other! And I don't want to end up like that with Rachel. I still like you!
Well, I'm not going in first. I bet that vein on Monica's forehead is popping like crazy.
Are you two talking about the same baby? Hey! Have you started off thinking of names yet?
I've never driven it! Okay? Not once! Okay once. Okay, I drive it all the time.
Don't worry, don't worry. We'll come up with a good lie. I'll help you practice it.
Well, I told you I had to spend all the day clearing out stuff, so Mike could move in.
W-w-I just-it's that-I have-y'know I have-I have an appointment. And it's very important.
Okay, you can totally say no, but umm, would it be okay with you if I set Ross up on a date?
Well, Ursula is a waitress and-and she lives in Soho. And Phoebe, is on this couch.
I'm telling you he's dead. What we are about to have here is a dead fat guy on a stick.
Um, is, is there any chance that you're rounding up? You know, like from, like 20?
And I have your name and the fact that you're a drifter, so the ball's pretty much in your court.
Well at least all my songs don't taste like garlic. Yeah, there are other ingredients Monica.
I wouldn't say never, you know there's that guy well what about ok well there's gotta be someone.
It's alright. Look kiddo, I gotta go. Good luck with the career. You're gonna be huge.
And tell them that in 2 weeks I will once again be a masseuse in good standing!
When I was you! Y'know what, it's all Joey's fault, 'cause he left his nose open!
Y'know what, it doesn't matter what you say it's not gonna make a difference anyway, so you can just go.
I know. Then, I'm gonna marry Chandler for the money and you'll marry Rachel and have the beautiful kids.
Yeah, I had a massage client who worked there and-and he said I had a knack for stocks.
So, what? Monica, we have the winning ticket! My psychic said I was gonna win, remember?
Well, yeah! But I'm not gonna take anymore crap. Okay? No more Mrs. Nice Bucket!
Yes, when I first met you, you were like, "Blah, blah, blah." I was like, shhh!
But Monica, he loves his job so much! Can you just give him another chance? Please?
Oh, okay, I learned how to shoot a lay-up, a foul shot, and a twenty-three pointer.
Well, all right. 1700 bags of peanuts flying that high, that's pretty amazing too.
Um, I'm gonna go meet Duncan, he's skating tonight at the Garden, he's in the Capades.
Okay, Jasmine, can you, can you ask Mr. Whiffler if he can wait for like five minutes.
I know, I know. So sweet... and so complicated. And for a shrink, he's not too shrinky, y'know?
ME TOO! I NEVER THOUGHT I COULD LOVE SOMEONE THIS MUCH!
Oh let me guess, and you wanna have them all at the same time and you wanna have them for your brother.
No, no, we don't really have time for this right now. Okay, we have to keep Chandler away from my bedroom.
There we go.You know what, if we were in prison, you guys would be, like, my bitches.
Oh, I'm sorry. Is that annoying? And speaking about being selfish in bed, how's Whitney?
No, no, you can get one yourself. It'll be on the house! Y'know what are big sisters for?
Excuse me! Can you tell me where I can find Earl? He's the supply manager around here.
But Joey, you're gonna be fine. You don't need that show, it was just a dumb soap opera.
Oh! Oh! Oh! Okay, fine, fine. Now I don't feel so bad about sleeping with Jason Hurley.
Really, it doesn't mean anything. I mean, you know, Monica refers to Chandler as Richard all the time!
But he didn't really know, you know. He wasn't planning on coming to Barbados and proposing to me...
Well, not for a little while. Let's just give him a few days to get used to everything else.
You know, I might know somebody. Hey, how about you set me up with someone, and we double date!
The exclamation point in the title scares me. Y'know, it's not just Freud, it's Freud!
Her name is Precious? Is she a purebreed or did you pick her up at the pound?
Yes, and then I realized I'm against that, and uh, so then we bought some, uh, boobs.
I don't think it would have sold a million copies but it would have made a nice gift for you.
Who are you kidding? You just find some guy off the street for me? Oh God! This is humiliating!
Yeah, oh, Princess Leia and the gold bikini, every guy our age loved that.
We did! We violated Section 12 Paragraph 7 of the criminal code!
Listen to you two. It's so sad. Looks like I'm gonna be going to the goddess meetings alone.
You guys, we said we were gonna have fun! Come on, hey, remember the time... You don't remember?
Ross, went to get a cab so we can all... No, wh-what are you doing! No, Monica, no!
It's just y'know, been a couple of hours, and she hasn't called. Not that I even care, y'know.
Oh yeah, oh and I know, but this isn't what it looks like, 'cause Rick is my ahh, husband.
Goodie! Thanks. So, how is it living with Rachel again? I mean, apart from the great food.
Your hair looks too good, I think it would upset her. Ross, why don't you come on in.
I like waking up with you too. Oh! It's such a beautiful morning. Oh, I can stay here all day.
I don't-she said y'know that I'd have triplets! But she also said one of them would be black.
Save it Red! Unless you wanna spend the night in the slammer, you apologize to the tree.
Yeah, I think I told it wrong. Y'know, we should talk about that because I don't totally understand what happened there.
I'm sorry... I'm sorry. It's obviously way too early for us to be... having that conversation.
Oh! Oh, I can't believe it! I mean I think it's great! For him. She might be able to do better.
Okay, I didn't understand that, but y'know, maybe that's 'cause you were speaking the secret language of love!
No, I-I mean your-your old best friend, here. Lily, from high school. Remember?
A real man wouldn't just run to the hospital! No! What would, what would Krog do?
Well, I'm returning a call from a certain mom at the B-E-A-C-H. I just spelled the wrong word.
Well let's just hope it works. Y'know nine out of ten marriages end in divorce?
Yes, but I wanted you to want to live with me, but okay, if you're having so much fun over here...
She's just so cute! I just wanna bite her ear off and use it and a sucking candy.
Okay, this is going to be harder than I thought. Umm, let's try some uh, aversion therapy.
Chandler's knees. Chandler's... ankles. Chandler's ankle hair. Oh no. Okay, you're all set.
Yeah. I was just in there. He introduced himself and the next thing I know, we're making out. You know.
Yeah, I really do. You know, I had nothing growing up. Just like the kids I took the money from.
Are you asking me out? 'Cause it would be kinda weird since you just broke up with my sister.
Joey, this is Mary Ellen Jenkins. So, Mike, how do you and Joey know each other anyway?
Okay, y'know what, you don't have to do that now. No-no-no-no!! Not him, you don't! Well the moment's over.
I just really wanted to apologize again and... and also show you something I think you'll find very exciting.
How can people do that?... Oh, you guys, look! Ugly Naked Guy got gravity boots!
I'm... I'm just... I'm the worst person ever. How can I not tell David that I'm seeing Mike?
Well, just you know, for argument's sake, you know, hypothetically. Which one would you be willing to give up?
You mean the time you broke the ketchup bottle and cleaned it up with Monica's guest towels?
Oh, great. Great. You're doing great, you know real strong. Going strong. Keep going.
There is nothing wrong with Jake! Okay? He is all man! I'm thinking even more than you.
It's me. It's Phoebe. Listen there's something in here I want to eat, what-what smells so good?
Ya, you know, Rachel ... she'll do whatever you want. Y'know, you can just walk all over her.
The voice woman. Ya know, I mean, she has a great voice but she doesn't have a video.
It's amazing! You better hurry up and fill out an application or I'm gonna beat you to it.
Yeah, it's totally meant to be. Tell him who you originally wanted to hook up with that night.
That's easy! You just have to think of him as a-as a jar of pickles that won't open.
You're kidding! And he plays rugby?! That's so funny. Ohh! I see how you did that. All right.
No, that's my stepdad. My real dad's the one that ran out on us before I was born.
I know! I guess I am! Oh my god! Load up the Volvo I want to be a soccer mom!
Ooh, y'know what, I think it's time for puppy to go out again. Come on, let's go to the balcony.
Ok, there is no top. That's the beauty of Smelly Cat. Um, why don't you just follow me?
Oh, yeah! Are you telling me you... you're not even... a little turned on by Monica, right now?
Perhaps because you gave her an engagement ring? Y'know Ross doctors are supposed to be smart.
No! No, you can't arrest me! No!! I won't go back! I won't go back to that hell hole!!
Yep, we shook on it. Yeah but believe me that is not how he wanted to seal the deal.
Well I guess it's okay to open one more if it's part of a set. Y'know, it's probably this one.
No no no, I'll be nice, I swear!!! Could you just give me the number for where they are?
Yeah... Oh Bitsy, hi. Uhm... listen I just wanted to thank you again for having me here tonight.
So how did this happen? Did she, did she lure you to an early bird dinner?
Not great, but we can work on it at lunch. Okay, I can be at your apartment in two hours.
Oh no! No no! Not at all. We're just moving in right now. See where it goes.
Yeah! Yeah! Convince her that-that you're scared of commitment! Convince her that you're a little coward!
I thought I'd try to take a walk. Would you pour me some water? I'll be back soon.
Yeah... Ogh... Okay, fine. You made your point. Can you please just be Mike Hannigan again?
So okay what? You're gonna be married to a girl who doesn't even know about it?!-Op, woman! Sorry.
Ok, and I have the, uh receipt for my dinner with Nokululu Oon Ah Ah.
Okay, so The Plaza! Okay, we'll get us some Mai Thai's, maybe no more for you though.
That's good, you should be impulsive and you should be romantic. Just...you did it with the wrong person. What?
I'm doing okay. I think it's going well. Do you think they're having fun? Am I talking to fast?
So. This has always been Monica's bed, what you're just noticing now, how self-involved are you?
So long! Don't let the best door in the world hit you in the ass on your way out!
No! There-there was a little, a little diff in the market and I lost 13 million dollars.
Well, I mean look it's, it's not your fault, you know. I mean this is just what, what she does to guys, okay.
OK, look, see, this is him. My mother gave me this picture before she died, same guy.
That's it? That's why you won't go out with her again? So, she took some fries, big deal!
This is madness. It's madness, I tell you, for the love of God, Monica, don't do it!! ...Thank you.
Then what's wrong with them? Would they not go with your tiny portions of pretentious food?
Yeah, I know, it's gonna be even worse for you... God... Ross, get ready to do some serious crying.
You know.. you let your guard down, you start to really care about someone, and I just- I-
Sorry. ..Y'know, those stupid soda people gave me seven thousand dollars for the thumb.
Yes!! Yes! Yes! Yes!! That's my Dad, that's Frank! Yeah! I'm sorry I'm getting all flingy.
Hi, Bubbles. Manly. Well, I just thought I would drop by and let you know how it went with Joey.
... with the double double double-jointed boy. Hey. So um, are you the professional guitar player?
Oh! Alright. Well I think the reason people laugh is becuase it's a play on the word roomy.
No. No! It's just y'know first, I wanna take off all my clothes and have you rub lotion on me.
Oh, I-I gave them the puppy and it made them so happy that I decided I'm gonna carry their baby.
Okay umm, I'd also like to try on the tiara. Oh yeah. Okay. What do you think, too much?
Okay, well, this is crazy. Can't seriously be talking about me taking one of your kids, can we?
OH!! Oh I thought they were just watching me. You know, like at, like at an aquarium, ya know.
All right. All right! If he wants a date? He's gonna get a date. All right, I'm gonna go in.
Ohh, you and your ways. Since it's Christmastime. I'm going to be one of those people collection donations.
Wow. So, okay, maybe that means that, you're not over Ross yet and you have issues with your father.
I'm so jealous you're all going! I can't believe I never knew that you can't fly in your third trimester!
Uh-huh. Okay. Okay, don't you think, maybe, though, it's just that he's so perceptive that it freaks you out?
Oh, now you're sad and creepy, oh. You know what, I, I'm sorry I quit, okay, I just quit.
Hey, tell him about Relaxi-Taxi, and-and ask him if he thinks that's better than Relaxi Cab.
Maybe that's because you haven't taken the time to get to know him. Let's remedy that, shall we?
No! No, her cab! She probably won't be using it; you can drive it to Las Vegas.
Okay, my turn. My turn. Oh! You're so cute! Oh, I could squeeze your little head! I won't.
Well, at least you didn't rent yours from a store called, "It's Not Too Late."
Wow, so glad I changed. Almost wore my ??? outfit that can't contain my breasts.
Listen, Mike, if you were Swedish and you were saying the word "lorkins" what flowers would that be?
I thought I was going home to go to bed, but I'm sensing there's something less fun for me to do here.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! No, no, you don't want that one. No, you can have this cool brown one.
Well, look, why don't you just, why don't you do your Phase Two strip club thing with us.
This place is so depressing. If I had to work here I'd kill myself. But you obviously haven't.
No. What do you, what do you want me to be, like some stupid, big, like, purple dinosaur?
Give me your hands. Strings. Gimme it! Pick. Do you want to learn to play guitar?
I just like him so much that I just feel like I've had 10 drinks today and I've only had six.
You know, it's so surprising that you and Joey have known each other for so long and I've never heard about you.
Hello. Oh good. Ross could you put up some of these flyers for me? OH!! Demon!! Demon!!
Okay but if you don't find him and bring him back, I am gonna hunt you down and kick your ass!
Yeah, but you've known Rachel since High School and you cannot just cut her out of your life.
What am I supposed to do? Ask every guy I make out with if he's married? No, yeah, I should.
Really? It doesn't have anything coming out of it. Or maybe there is some place for her in your bedroom?
I know! I know, I opened it up and there it was, just floating in there, like this tiny little hitch-hiker!
Okay, I will find someplace else to do the rest of my appointments. I just don't know what the big deal is!
Yeah. . . I'm sorry. We weren't really looking for anything to happen with you guys. I, I have a boyfriend.
Hi! Hi! Listen, my friend Ross is about to be divorced for the third time, but wouldn't you date him?
Well, why did you make like a whole big thing out of y'know, everyone has to hang out in the big apartment?
Well, it just, it doesn't feel like playing anymore, it feels like work. It's like I'm working in the field.
I know, I know, we can drive, we can vote, we can work, what more do these broads want?
She's already fluffed that pillow... Monica, you know, you've already fluffed that- -but, it's fine!
Yeah well, once again not knocking pays off. I only wish you hadn't been on the toilet.
Umm, I'm talking about that which you already know but won't admit. You love her again; you re-love her!
Okay but look! Look at what I got! It's her address book! We have a guest list!
Wow! This place is incredible! Sting's pen...that he gave to Phoebe. Come on! Secret passageway!
Wait! But Ross if they don't get along then you should smooth things over. Make them be friends.
Anyway, OK, now promise you won't like, freak out and say how great this is until I'm done, OK.
Well, I'll tell you Rachel Karen Green, I had plans with Joey tonight and he left me this note.
Oh, well um, not right now. Y'know I'm just gonna go to bed, I think the fumes are giving me a headache.
Look, she only suspects something okay? She doesn't know for sure, so just throw her off the track.
It's not kicking me, it's kicking one of the other babies. Oh ! Don't make me come in there!
Of course I can! It's just good sense to backup your backup! Look, I've already lost Chandler!
And! And, they're gonna have a baby! And! And, they want me to grow it for them in my uterus.
Yeah well, maybe she should've spent a little less time decorating and a little more time in the bedroom.
I just went to my old apartment to get you the-the cookie recipe and the stupid fire burned it up!
I am one of Ben's mothers. I'm a lesbian. It was, it was difficult coming out to my parents.
Well, uhm, back in my mugging days, you know, I, uhm, I worked St. Marc's Comics.
You guys! You guys! You don't have to fight over her anymore. Whoever doesn't get Gladys gets Glynnis.
Y'know, this is probably none of my business, but weren't you guys supposed to not be seen in public together?
Ooh-oh! Someone's wearing the same clothes they had on last night. Someone get a little action?
Oh, I was just here looking for, um, my um, my part of an old sandwich. Oh, here it is! Oh.
Yeah. See, that money was for a big wedding, that we thought we didn't want, but it turns out we do.
Stop it! Stop it! She keeps squirming, trying to get away! Just like when she was alive.
Rach, look! Oh, hi! Where is my strong Ross Skywalker to come rescue me. There he is.
Yeah. Oh, except one of the strings on my guitar is broken. Hey, Chandler, can I borrow your G-string?
Okay do you-Okay, do you have a search warrant? Because the last time I checked this was still America!
Okay, oh and you know, if she gets upset, just scratch her tummy and give her a liver snout.
...in Reservations at 8:00 by Neil Simon. Thank-thank you Neil. Thank you for the words.
Oh, yeah, he clipped on, he said call him as soon as you get a chance, he's at Flimby's.
Good. Y'know-no-no, okay, it's-it feels like everything's been about me lately, so what's happening with you?
Because this one is now! And-and it's two of our best friends! Who knows what you're gonna marry!
Just one last time erm... the marriage thing... there's no wiggle room? None at all?
Sure. It's just as well... I mean, last year wasn't very good. I think she's losing her touch.
All right, wait just one more second. Hi, it's Phoebe and Rachel's. Please leave a message, thanks!
Atlantic City, baby! Let's roll some bones! Hey Joey, high-five for rolling bones!
yeah well yeah you know Emma's birth certificate might say Geller but her eyes say Mookurgee.
Ohh! I have! I have! I started making these little sock bunnies! Oh for crying out loud!
If we are not doing it together, we're not doing it at all! So, say goodbye to your tickets! .
See, I-I think that one that Elton John wrote for, um, that guy on Who's The Boss.
Oh, I have dinner plans with Joey. We get together about once a month to discuss the rest of you guys.
Ooh, is that spelled with a 'C' or a 'K'? Oh my God! It doesn't matter; they're both great!
I thought you were excellent! In fact for a minute there I was like, "Ooh, where'd Ross go?"
Smelly cat, smelly cat, what are they feeding you? Smelly cat, smelly cat, it's not your fault.
Yeah that's true. Yeah, you love her. You always have. You have a child together. There is no right answer.
No, I'm just gonna help him, you know, get 'de-Ursula-ized', like you know, like I did for Joey after he went out with her.
Hi! It's me. And soup. Hey, I just saw Josh, he looks so yummy in your leather jacket.
Because you are so afraid of commitment! You talk to him, make him scared like you! Make him a...man!
Why don't take care of this one, and should I get pregnant again, I'll hold onto your card, okay?
Thanks! Y'know, that when you say things like that it makes me wanna rip that sweater vest right off!
Ok well, before you do, I know we weren't supposed to get you going away presents, but I do have something for you.
Now Ben, sometimes people may seem like jerks on the outside, but they have famous fathers.
Oh I-I don't know about that. No, I think that if the two of you had sex the-the-the repercussions would be catastrophic.
I can't believe it! I did it! I rode a bike! I never thought I'd be able to do that! Thank you Ross.
I'm sorry, I-I-I-I don't live here anymore. I-I didn't know how to tell you, but y'know everybody else knows!
Are you kidding? The woman has the nose of a bloodhound ... and the breasts of a Greek goddess.
Yeah, and it really freaked me out! And after a while I even tried to hurt you and it just spurred you on.
Lather, rinse, repeat, and lather, rinse, repeat, and lather, rinse, repeat, as needed.
Okay, I understand why Superman is here, but why is there a porcupine at the Easter Bunny's funeral?
I just talked him into it, don't tell me I have to do you too. The puppet master gets tired people.
Oh, ok. How, it's been so long since you've had sex, you're wondering if they've changed it?
It's nothing, it's just- Okay. I'm going through my mail, and I open up their monthly, you know, STATEMENT-
Hi, Ben. I'm your father. I am... the head. Aaaaaahhhh.... Alright, this barbecue is gonna be very fun.
Oh, ok, you know what I don't get? The way guys can do so many mean things, and then not even care.
Yeah, you are. And I'm so glad that you fought your way back in, because I don't know what I would do without you.
Oh, I'm so sorry. Um, and maybe I'm wrong! I but-y'know I'm gonna go out with him again, I'll find out more.
Wait okay, if this game is gonna cause problems between the two of you, then maybe I should just keep it.
Um, perhaps. Yes! Yes, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I was just afraid that you were still hung up on my sister.
Oh! It's okay, you calm down after a while and then people can see how really sweet and wonderful you really are.
I know! Evil! And... and... and... I like Mike so much, you know. It's just going really well. Oh my God!
No because I chickened out the last time when I tried to meet him. So I mean coincidences? I don't think so.
Um, Rachel I'm really sorry. That's okay, do you wanna get back together? Yeah, okay. Did anyone else hear that?!
No! I am a positive person. You are like Santa Clause on Prozac, at Disneyland, getting laid!
I'm not. I'm praying. Please let the Knicks win... Thank you Thor! Where... where are you going?
Uh-huh. Now you can turn around or you can go in there and rip the Band-Aid off. What to you want to do?
Can you believe this? We were waiting for a hot guy and then an even hotter one shows up!
How could you pick up a hitchhiker?! He could be a rape-, a rapist or a killer or something!
Nothing, I just thought I'd stop by.. y'know, after the uh... that I.. y'know, so what are you doing here?
I can't! I can't! Unless... Well are you saying that-that you would move out if-if I didn't buy that lamp?
Yeah! Sure! Yep! Oh, y'know what? If I heard a shot right now, I'd throw my body on you.
Oh my God, you're right! I am too late; they're sitting on the couch and talking! Come on! Rachel?
Oh, I thought this was your party and it turns out it's a party for Howard. He's just the sweetest little man!
I feel really strongly about this, Rachel. Please, don't use this gift certificate. I'm asking you as a friend.
No, it's just that he got this new like home theater dealie, and he wants y'know, us to check it out.
I'm not done yet, OK. God. OK, if that goes well, they may even want to make an album.
Gosh. I'm not gonna let that man make you eat your baby. Oh. Hey! Who is that guy? I think I know him.
I still cannot believe you're engaged! Just 'cause its happening so fast; not 'cause you're such a loser.
And y'know, even if they break up again, you'd better not let him in your sad men's club!
So! Ross doesn't really decorate his tree with floss, but you don't hear him complaining do you? God!
They're just talking, and y'know what? Just because I think they're soul mates doesn't mean anything's gonna happen.
No. It starts with a "v" and ends with an "x". Helpfully with a "to" in the middle.
So great. Oh, we took a nap today and my Mom fell asleep on my tummy and purred.
You mean the one that my grandmother made me swear on her deathbed that I would never let out of our family?
That is so sweet. But don't you think it's a little too soon? I mean there's so much we don't know about each other.
Ok, look, before you even start, I'm not denying evolution, ok, I'm just saying that it's one of the possibilities.
No, and so there's no one to walk me down the aisle and... well, I would just really love it if you would do it.
Ok, I'll fight for her. Ok! Oh, wait, oh I just realized... if I do that, that means you don't get her.
Okay, so umm, somebody has to call Frank and Alice. And then my mom wants to know--Joey, what are you doing?!
Yeah, well he'd prefer water colors, but y'know, he has easy access to a lot of charcoal.
Hey you guys, look, the one-eyed jack follows me wherever I go. Right, OK, serious poker.
There you go! Oh, you are so lucky! You might actually get to meet Sting tomorrow! That's why you have kids!
Wait, am I missing something though? 'Cause I thought death was something that's supposed to be sad, in a way.
Ooh, technically you owe me $600 for sending out happy thoughts on your last ten auditions.
Huh? Can you just imagine getting down on one knee and handing her this gorgeous piece of weaponry?
Oh. Okay, well I-I was kinda hoping that I would just...be alone y'know to think about my mom and her suicide.
Hey! Check it out! This is unbelievable! Joey has been holding his breath for almost four minutes!
Ooh, oh, I've gotta go. Whoa, oh, head rush. One more, and then I have to go. Cool!
