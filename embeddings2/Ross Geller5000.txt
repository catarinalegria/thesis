It was just a kiss.
That is so unfair!
Do you feel better?

Umm, she kissed me.
But I didn't want to.
Okay, good-good for you.
I am very...very sorry.

There we go. All better.
Who the hell is Jordie?
How could you have told her?
Yes, and that's why we're here.
Mon, Mon, are you OK?
I thought that was just a rumour.
It hurts my teeth.
From you? Yes, please!
He does not look happy.
I've been back and forth.
Yes! We're getting married?!
The lie you just told.
Hey. What was that all about?
It's a day to be thankful.
Should we send something?
He's taking her purse!
Oh, you-you're-you're one to talk.
Green. To the green.
I'm gonna get you to talk to Chandler.
Umm, would you like to dance?

C'mon! This looks good!
So, you're not going to Paris.
Ow! Ow! Oh, no-no-no!

Joey, some people don't like that.
Yeah, I was going for the metaphor.
Look at you! You're up!
Uhhhhhh...that-that may be weird.
I'm gonna get some more coffee.
Hello! Can I get you anything?
Well, hello, Mrs. Ross!
How'd the callback go?

This place is really beautiful!
Hey, you wet my pants!
And that's Phoebe over there!
Great, how did it go?
Actually, it wasn't that close.
What... what you working on?
Some of your old stuff.
And what is second prize?
Huh, didn't see that coming.
I'm gonna have to give him up.
Oh no-no-no, it's my pleasure.
Open it, open in.
You-you just said that you did!
Why are you mad at me?
You wanna buy a car?
Long story, honey.
Your ex-boyfriend is insane.
So you two are really serious?!
Well, do you wanna marry him?
C'mon! Joey! What is it?
I don't! I wanna be with her.
You don't have to shout everything.
Hey, how are you holding up?
I'm pretty sure that it is...
Uh we-we need to talk.
Rachel! What are you doing here?
I will, I will find him.
Okay, seriously, what do you think?
Unagi. I'm always aware.
Why aren't you guys dressed?
I didn't give her that ring!
Look, I do not re-love her.
We're sorry, Pheebs, we're sorry.
I didn't say we were brothers.
You were trying to eat it!
Hey! It's starting to snow.
Divorced men's club.

He finally asked you out?
Wow. What does that mean?
Hi, is uh, is Carol here?
Wow! Happy Monica's night!
That's what it seemed like.
Oh my God, is that still...
You've had feelings for me?

It's just a fur ball.
Wait! It was my plan.
And I'm Doctor Ross Geller.
And that wasn't fun for you?
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa, Joey!
I'm never gonna find love again.
You are way off, pal.
So you do know a little English.
Oh yeah! Wasn't she uh...
What are you guys doing later?
We're really gonna do this, huh?
I can't believe he didn't come!
Great. So let's get going?
Come on, show them to me.
That is gonna hurt tomorrow!
And why wouldn't he get it?
Oh that is so great! That's...
I-I'm, I'm having a boy?
I just can't see Chandler cheating!
Ugh, can you believe that guy!
Dude, I wanted him to guess.
I think the check in is that way.
Glad I could help man.
Chandler. I sensed it was you.
Yeah, and-and thank you for Emily.
Okay, I didn't know you would say that.
Phoebe! Wow! No, no, no!
Okay, I'm scum, I'm scum.
...since I stopped trying.
He's a brilliant diagnostician!
Well, ??? think that's us?
Can I talk to you for a minute?
Cannot feel my tounge.
C'mon kid, let's go.
Okay. Um, how about these?
Ok, use it in a sentence.
Man, I sure miss Julie.
Oh, what were the other two?
Umm, your boxes are umm...
Hey, do uh, do you have a minute?
Joey, you look nothing like Ben.
Dr. Green. How are you?
...will be two months...
No touch! No touch!
You are? Me, too!
Oh my God, wh-what happened?
What's - what's going on?
Thanks again, Dr. Green.
A basket of mini-muffins.
What is the matter with you?!?
No, no, I'm serious. Thank you.
Damn, I forgot you were here.
So I don't wanna be just anybody.
What? We're never gonna make it!
And!! Isabella Rosselini.
Damn super cuts!
Mma, Mma, Mmaah
Noooo!!! Every time!!!
Um... uh.... vulva.
WHAT? WHERE? WHERE?
I don't know what you're talking about.
I don't even know what that's for.
It's the only possibility, Phoebe.
Well, if you think it would help.
Huh? Yeah! Yes, of course!
I am like Indiana Jones.
Nono, that would be me again.
I think just the annulment for today.
Probably shouldn't touch me.
No-no. It's-it's me, Ross!
Oh, thanks. Oh, you're the best.
So . . . Welcome.
Wh-what did he say?!
Hey Pheebs, how's it going?
Why do you care so much?
Yeah, so far nothing stupid.
Come on, you know they love you.
I know, and with the baby coming?
Because, because I've got Ben.
Rach, I got a message from you.
Oh, oh there go the clothes.
No! I balanced my checkbook.
Yes, of course they like you!
Come on, they're gonna love you.
I'm sorry I'm late, what happened?
Thanks, man, big help.
I have an oily T-zone!
Hey, I thought I cheered you up.
Y'know what? Uh, Rachel is here!
What, to blind my child?
No more falafel for you!
Wow! How'd you get in there?
Trying to date this woman.
Phoebe, you said it was urgent!
Hey! She didn't look 50!
Oh. And what do you call that?
Y'know this ??? is incredible.
Alright, alright, ok. Bye.
OK, now, sit. OK.
Yeah, well, m-maybe you're right.
I love it, when we share.
That said it was my sandwich?!
Wow, hello! You look great!
How do you feel about all this?
Well, we should probably get going.
It's just I miss her so much.
I don't understand what just happened here.
That's, that's funny. Change!
His daughter was hot.
Yes, and the dimmer switch.
I can't get *enough* dinosaurs!
But you already told me everything.
Hey! I just heard. What's up?
Okay, guys, wish me luck.
Oh no! An asteroid!
What? A brain transplant?!
Alright, alright, let's do this!
Whoa! You had sex today?
Joey what-what were you thinking?!
You called Animal Control?
You're good. These are not.
Oh, yeah. Emma's doing great.
OK, I need to lie down.
Maybe it's a universal thing?
Ohh, it's Joey! I love Joey!
With you?! Yeah right!
Does it always, uh--?
Yeah, just... just Nana stuff.
Okay. You know that I-I have to go.
You guys know where Rachel is?
Hey, Phoebs, how'd it go.
Oh, I'll-I'll come hug you.
Hey, what's behind your back?
I don't know, I-I was all high.
Yeah he was wasn't he.
Yeah, he's head of the department.
Look at all these paleontologists!!
You're wearing the same shirt.
Did you really hear a bear?
Together? Like-like to people?
Y'know what? I'm good! I'm good!
Faded salmon color.
Look, they must be stopped!
You uh, you don't believe in gravity?
Me too. I'm good at it.
Umm, it's Cutie McPretty.
So that's two of my wives.
Everything? Even the TV?
I wanna say it's not looking good.
Just, just say what you feel.
Looks like a fun gang.
It's what you want. You should go.
I know, and I can't stop sweating.
Look, I took it too far!
It's okay man, be strong.
I guess it's worth a try.
Please tell me you're joking.
Oh. What's wrong with Ross?
What are you doing here, Santa?
Yeah-no, just that last song.
She doesn't know what to say!
Really? Well then tell it to me.
You had fantasies about Emily?
Okay, gimme my monkey back.
That's right, uh, Elizabeth Hornswoggle.
Slides are almost ready.
No, I, I only know Lipson.
Monica, what is the matter with you?
Try telling my wife that.
Nothing! What do you say to that?
So you don't wanna go to Williamsburg?
Fine, I'm mentally unstable.
Are you wearing two belts?
How can you not believe in evolution?
Whoa-whoa-whoa! Emily, honey, okay?
Yeah, yeah, what's with the trophy!
She didn't photograph well!
No, just give me another minute.
No, but, your-your mad.
Well, it needs to be plicit.
Do you uh, do you talk about me?
Oh, yeah, yeah that's Michelle.
We are a rare breed.
Where the hell have you been?
And why exactly would I do that?
Well, that's cool. So did...
You too! What are the odds?
What, uh... what were you thinking?
Did you just wink at me?
Y'know what would cheer you up?
Do you know the word crapweasel?
Then what am I supposed to do?
What?! I wh-, what's wrong?
Okay, can we just sign please?
Thanks. And-and hey Joe?
Where exactly is your zoo?
Hey, someone order a coat?
Why is it inside out?!
All right, we'll work it out.
So, are you gonna see him again?
Yeah I'll press 1!
Over my dead body!
Oh, you have some studying to do?
Hey! What's she doing back here?
I'm telling you, I like the food!
Ah, which, which one?
What? It's, it's just a phase.
Hey! I offered to marry her!
Oh yeah, yeah, sure. Absolutely.
Really girls, not cool.
So, so now do I get Joey?
I'll get it! I will get that!
That! Let's talk about that.
The eyes...did still sparkle.
Why? What was wrong with her?
All right, I just wanted to check.
Ben! I mean, Ben! Ben!
Why-why would I care about that?
Are you kidding? Oh my God...
Why don't you use your Thesaurus?
That was very nice Ashley.
Oh for cryin' out loud!
Well, why don't you correct him?
Okay... okay, maybe I will...
Hey everybody! Happy Thanksgiving!
...desperate, needy, pathetic?
73! 72! 71!
Electrifying. Emphatic time-time-time...
Uh.... bean! Bean!
Did the TV wake you?
Why, why would you open it?
Rachel! I'll just call her back.
No, no, we want to wait, right?
Great. I feel like an idiot.
Dude, I was gonna ask her out.
I'm a professor here uh, Ross...Geller.
Sure! Ooh-ooh, what about this?
Ohh, you can see them, huh?
Yeah, but, but look what I'm...
And that's, that's funny why?
Why? Why can't you go to him?
Eh? We'll show him!
...How long was I in there?
One more day, seriously/
Hi, hi, I'm Ross Geller.
Catch any big fish?
I-I had to show Chandler something?
If only he were a woman.
Ok, Michelle, it's time to go.
Look Phoebe, I'm sorry it's just...
Well go! Go move it!
THE HELL I DO!
Wh- are you welling up?
You've got to be kidding me!
Oh, right, because he's a scientist!
I have a bone to pick with you.
Could you be less enthused?
Uh, no, it's-it's just this person.
So I nodded off a little.
Wha-, oh, quit it.
How do you count to five?
Ohh, yeah I already have one.
I think we proved our point.
Now you are going to love these.
Okay, it must just be me then.
Look, Pheebs-Pheebs, it's gonna be okay.
The card! I think we're there!
And the place looks so nice!
No no, you're fine, you're fine.
What difference does that make?!
Oh, I don't, I don't, I don't know...
I know. I am, I am so sorry.
What?! Chandler she's our cousin!
You said you'd marry Joey?
I have to break up with Charlie?
Fine, just stop thinking about me.
What about the guy from the bar?
Huh, I took a shot there.
Oh, I kinda was, wasn't I?
Sure, sweepin'. You never know.
Oh yeah? What are you gonna do?
She already lives in London.
They're not listening too me?
Oh, Rach...oh..."gleba" is not a word.
Nope, just the one. RACH!
Why do they keep doing that?
Who's drink can I freshen?
What? Are you going back to work?
And now you want that money back.
It's still looks pretty far!
Nothing. Nothing nothing nothing.
Hey, remember when I had a monkey?
You got me a cola drink?
Hey, Rach, can I get some coffee?
Yeah, but-but he didn't know that!
No, I'm not gonna pick them up.
We'll be starting with apples.
Not using it right, Joe.
What?! Give-give me a brush.
Listen, I'm in Elizabeth's bathroom...
Why? What, what are you jealous?
There isn't that's what I'm saying.
I don't know. What's in this pie?
That is one good looking man!
Hey everybody, Pheebs is here!
Yes. Yes! Please, come in.
Okay, you are totally making this up.
I ... I was just talking about Rachel.
Hmm? Oh, a student I don't know.
I'm dead and no one cares?
No, no, no, this weekend guys!
You sprayed my front twice!
Aw, he's gonna be so happy.
What?! Over a stupid room!
I got bottled breast milk.
So I'm gonna take off then!
Hey, so uhm... How was dinner?
Can I get some of that action?
We'll see how dinner goes.
Then be supportive like a guy.
Oh, I hope they're not ruined.
It's my new apothecary table!
No! No, I don't...don't want to.
Yeah. You, uh, you want some?
I was thinking more like a hundred.
This is not good for my rage.
All right, I'll see you guys later.
Come on, finish your enchilada.
Oh, uh, Phoebe just started a...
Doctor Burke is sexy?
Rach, she's not going to remember this.
Wow! I could've died tonight.
Hey, save us some pizza.
Well did you try calling her?
Oh hey, right back at ya.
It uhh, it won't go back.
Well? Isn't that amazing?
Thanks. Thanks. And thanks again.
Ah-ha, nowhere to run!
Oh, major shampoo explosion!
All right. All right, I'll do it.
Oh here, I think this is us. Yeah.
Wow, how many have you got?
Thank you so much for that gift!
Ok, here, here. There we go.
Really? You're not gonna return it?
Ok, got the vent open.
No, I-I'm saying I liked her.
Oh, I don't know how that got in there.
What, that wasn't the great news?
Actually, nectarines, but basically...
Did you know Chandler kissed Rachel?
She seems really, really fun!
So what's it shaped like?
It was, it was her voice.
I love when you talk dirty to me.
So this is an annual thing?
Is there a hopping bonus?
If you wanna call that a reason.
Look, you wanna get off my back?
No, but it is frowned upon.
Well, Chandler and I are in a bar...
What you got over there? Tacos?
Nooo, but it, but it's great.
Well, can I talk to you for a sec.?
...But a man can change.
Hey, it's been like three weeks!
Oh my God! You did that yourself?
Hey, I helped you find Waldo!
Yeah! Oh, I-I love this babies!
Emily? Emily? I'm coming in.
Hey, how can it not be me?!HeyHey!
Hey uh, I brought you some lunch.
Just, just, just pick one!
Okay, okay! I'm going. I'm going.
Come on, she's gonna love you guys!
And, uh, and then I kissed her.
Hey umm, was-was Monica here?
Well, who's gonna kiss my sister.
Uh, actually, we're getting a cat.
Please. This is so your fault.
What? I can't cancel on Joan!
Well we...we don't have a garage.
Please don't say naked chicks.
Oh Rach that's great. That's great.
Buddy, my monkey, my monkey.
No... I already e-mailed her.
You bought Shawn Cassidy!
And you didn't marry him because...?
No thank you for... Thank you.
How we doing, you guys ready?
And she's supposed to buy this?!
Well... not in the same way...
Five to be lying, six.
Do you say this stuff to girls?
Done! With time a-to-spare.
Well, I thought it first, Holmes.
Okay, listen I am not a pervert!
Yeah that-that, doesn't look right.
And what are you going to do for him?
She hates Pottery Barn?!!
Oh-oh, were you, were you watching?
And why do you care so much?
Hey, where's uh, where's mom?
Come on! Come on. Come on.
Wha-, you have a phone in here?
You'll never get me, Joe!!!
No, that that is not what we're saying.
Forget it, she's destroying it.
That's all you're basing this on?
You promised you wouldn't say anything.
Maybe you should look up "fascinating."
Oh, come on, you know it's a girl!
Sure, we don't live there but...
I'm sorry... we... we can't.
I'd like to spin the wheel!
No, Rachel doesn't want me to....
Pheebs, did...you want a cookie?
I made fun of his accent.
Happy New Year, Pheebs!
I really think they're out of rooms.
Okay. Have a great time you guys.
Now I cannot wait to see this.
Um, you know, just out of curiosity...
Except for "Match game"...
Oh, I see, so everybody wins.
You have a line down your face.
Not two years in a row.
I don't know, probably just invest it.
All right, did you just say all right?
There's something new in the bowl.
Yeah, no one talks like that!
Excuse me ladies. I'm sorry?
Really?! I mean, even with the card?
Anyway, so, uh, so what is it?
I think I might know what this is about.
Rach, what uh, what are you doing here?
Yeah? I was good at the stuff huh?
Oh great, I live on the street.
So how long are you in town?
When did I say you were boring?!
No, no, don't. Why don't we?
All right. 'Candy and Cookie?'
Oh, hey, Gunther, check this out.
And um...You look nice today.
I gotta get going. Bye Chandler.
Mom no, come on! Thank you.
What? How come that you don't have to go!
That's worse than no food.
Okay, I'll see you later pal.
I went to Egypt with my dad.
The physical act of love.
Really? Did you count Mississipily?
Because you sent away the dog!
Hey Chandler, what are you doing tonight?
Wait, well wh-wh-wh-where is she?
Ohh! Thank you! I like mail.
What? That's like insanely easy!
Huh? So? We have a deal?
Ah, we'll all go. Come on.
And she feels the same way?
So we...we both wanted to.
Alright you kids, bye now.
It's alright, it's no big deal.
Hey Joey! Great stuff huh?
So uh, wha-uh, what do you do?
All right. I think it was a mouse.
Mississippilesly? Well, how bad is it?
Why are we in bed together?
Do not give him any money!
...that center around work.
Come here, Marcel. Sit here.
Oh my God, what's goin' on?
Hello, baby. Hello, hello.
Joey, the guy's your best friend.
And that's not against your oath?!
No, women are welcome to play.
Not for the next few minutes.
What?! What?! Talking about what?!
...and I really think it should be me.
Have a good time. Ok, Ben.
Uh, sweetie we've gotta go.
Well, he had gravity boots.
Won't you dance around with me.
Hi honey, how did it go?
: Joey, I'm a little shy.
How much did you pay for that?
I dunno, there's just something about...
Look, it's just a little more complicated...
No, I just think Monica was that fat.
What?! Hello! We didn't get married.
Phoebe really likes the bike huh?
Yeah, were better off without them.
No, she was definitely on my bed.
Well, okay, what-what did she say?
No really, you tell me what's up.
Alright, but you have to do one sometime.
Well umm, y'know, I used to play.
Oh no, I have plans with Elizabeth.
The chocolates aren't here yet.
Look I'm sorry Pheebs, I can't do it.
Let me see that! Oh man!
Okay, that's great. No, I'm- Oh.
Look uh, if we're gonna do this...
Hey, I can handle it! All right?
We uh, we just cooked it up.
Is it? Feels like two.
Ohh, this cake is really good!
Oh great! What, you brought Joey?
I could ask her to live with me!
Oh good, you haven't left yet.
What, uh... what juggling thing?
I am not doing this over the phone.
You gotta be at least bi...
Okay. So we're, we're good?
Well, then who was on my bed?
They make you take an oath?
And you told Phoebe you were engaged.
So-so what did the doctor say?
You told her before you told us?
Can't we just use a pen?
people so why you all dressed up.
Well you need 60% to pass...
It's Gandolf, and he's not coming.
Surely you can think of something good.
What's wrong with being the Bings?
Hey. Oh, I'm sorry, this is Cailin.
Oh, come on, Rach, he's a guy!
No, no, Dad, I was just wondering.
And I too am just a love machine.
Hey, we can rescedule for Saturday.
Even if we want it really bad.
My first time with Carol was...
On account of my rage.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You were saying?
Oh, it was, nah, well....
I'm tellin' you. You can't do this.
Powder! Yeah! Yeah, I have powder!
And on your anniversary, for shame!
Why- why are you here, Carol?
Nuh, uh, the moment's gone.
Okay, that's it, I can't take it anymore.
Rach, have you never done this before?
Just ah... just put roommate.
That only took me an hour.
Well, why're you all dressed up?
You were my first kiss with Rachel?
We?! We angered it?!
You want me to call her right now?
Yeah, I know, I uh, I tried them on.
Phoebe he's right, that is the rule.
I can't believe Chandler is missing this!
Rachel said she'd marry you?!
She wants me to move to London.
It's a little early to be drinkin'.
Yeah, save it for the cab, okay.
Correct, his profession was?
Nice, put it with the others.
Phoebe, how could you do this to me?!
OK sweetie, I'll see you later.
Helen Geller? I don't think so.
Pa-haa!! I would love to go with you.
Uh, never mind, I don't want to know.
All right. All right, I'm gonna do it!
Well yeah, I think we should get married.
I hope Ben has a little sister.
Oh! So-so seriously, what time?
So umm, where are the other guys?
Sorry I ah, I scared you in there.
I do not always have to be-okay, okay.
I'm getting married today!! Whoo-hoo!!
Y'know what? I'm really not in the mood.
No. I am not putting on makeup.
Phoebe, I told her you already knew.
Yeah, a lot of my students do that.
It's also a sign of friendship.
It's okay. Come, come on in.
Whatever dude, you kissed a guy.
Did that guy just call you Toby?
Okay! Do you wanna tell the story?!
Answer better, answer better!
She said you gave her the razor!
Hey. Oh, oh, how'd it go?
Pheebs? What, why are you whispering?
You're my friend. I-I had to tell you.
Kind of inappropriate, don't you think?
Dude, I need to talk to you a sec.
Ohh, I just like the smell. Mmmm.
I see. You didn't happen to tell.
I was just outside Barcelona, hiking...
That little naked guy would be me.
What's up with the greed Joe?
Rachel please! That is so inappropriate!
You never cooked since 1996.
Seriously that's a lot of cups.
No? What happened, big guy?
But-but, Liam's on my team.
Ehm... Her name is Emma.
What? You forgot fourteen states?
Hey listen man, about the stripper...
...is for me not to see you anymore.
Is that supposed to be an insult?
Oh yeah, let me just finish this.
Hey you leave Marcel out of this!
What's wrong with people having sex?
So uh... I guess I wanna take off.
So uh, have a great time down there.
Still sharp as a tack!
As a romancer of the elderly.
Oh no-no, after you. Oh my God!
Really. It's always been you, Rach.
No, no, they will. I just... uh...
15? Your personal best!
Get away from me I said no!
Help! Help!! Help! Help!!
Umm, uh, I was just telling the guys...
Oh yeah, no no no...that's great!
I don't have too. I can just look at you.
You got ink on your lip.
That is so good! Do it again!
Rach, she's got like three hairs!
Eh, you got a spray-on tan?
Hey, what have you guys been up to?
Hi, did you order some bananas?
I can't believe no one believes me!
Alright boys, let's eat.
Well, I said-I said something to Phoebe.
I cannot believe we're having this conversation.
No, come on don't start. Ouch!
Okay, do-do you have a good grip?
Nothing I do means anything, really.
Are you're hands still wet?
No one, I'm just saying if...
That sounds great. Same for me.
Umm that's...that's a little misleading.
Yeah, oh hey, you are right on time.
Do you wanna start telling secrets?
And yet somehow it's true!
Ah! Ah! I forgot my jacket!
I... ahem... I really don't think so.
Yes. I'm... I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
Oh Mon, I laughed so hard...
Hey, Paulo. What are you doing here?
You complete me kitchen, matey!
So really, what'd ya have?
Thank you! That's what I keep saying.
Hey does anyone have any gum?
Yes, please! So, what's going on?
It-it's great to meet you Paul.
Ugh. It's definitely getting worse.
No, but I want...I want the pinecones!
Was I talking to her about gas?
Okay, okay, okay. I'll get the bagels.
That guy, he burns me up.
Ohh, here's that Macadamia nut!
I told you there was going to be sub-titles.
Pheebs, what, is it the age thing?
Joey, Homo Sapiens are people.
You're welcome for a delicious dinner.
Look, can, can you do something for me?
Wo-wo-whoa. What about Phoebe's birthday?
Aww. Thank you, Aunt Phoebe.
Oh, be-because of the leather pants.
He gave me a pill for it.
Dude, we are sooo gonna party!
Yeah, yeah. It wasn't every morning.
Are you into crafts at all?
That was 14 hours ago.
Do they wait for me to do this?
Not on you! On the stripper!
Somewhere maybe along the equator?
Uh, you weighted 200 pounds.
All right! I want my key back!
I chose those, I'm a paleontologist.
Stupid balls are in the way.
Wow! This is very flattering, uh...
Okay, go left. Left! Left!
Okay, I've got three of my five.
Look, look I'm sorry. It's just that....
Rach, uh, you still looking for a place?
Then where the hell have you been?!
Ohh! A man with a plan!
All right, bad ankle, got it!
Hey! Uh, Phoebe's not here is she?
You, you sure you need shoes? Okay.
C'mon, just tell me, please, please.
Yes, we did, everything's A-OK!
Wait-wait. I, I got it. I was there.
Man! They cannot get enough!
I am not unemployed. I'm on sabbatical!
I'm good, I have dinner plans .
Oh that is quite all right ma'am.
We're rehearsing a Greek play.
Really? Yeah that-that sounds interesting.
I played bad on purpose guys.
Can I use.. either thumb?
No, no, no. I'm not in the zone.
Yes. Yes. Just here and there .
Okay. Um... is he a good guy?
That's funny. Umm.... It's not funny.
What the hell happened on that beach?!
Dad, she won't want to go with me.
Yeah! I-I teach it in my class.
Oh, just this woman I've been seeing.
There are naked ladies there too.
AND ON MY TURF?
Phoebe, why is your bag moving?
It's funny you should mention diapers.
Marcel! What've you done to him?
So uh, Emily called last night...
What is ah, Rach in her room?
Because there are naked ladies there.
You had a rough day, uh?
Uhh, it was okay. Yeah, it was fun.
No. No, I gotta go home sometime.
No, I ah, I slept with someone else.
Umm. Umm, I'm-I'm just gonna-
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Let her dangle.
Right. Okay, let's play. Let's go.
Well it's okay. Chandler is talking to her.
Hey! Guess what I got for your wedding!
Okay, I'll just wait for him in here!
Ok, what the hell happened back there?
Maybe I should stand on your feet!
Ooh, I wanna switch to Rachel too!
Now umm, remember I'm still learning.
Yeah? Well, I-I think Ben's asleep.
Le Poo's still alive?!
First of all, I'm not losing...
No, she kept kicking me away!
Oh please, hit by a blimp?
Uh, Joe, have you looked outside?
So uh, Emily just went to the airport.
I... I don't know what you are talking about.
You know the song! Sing along!
Wow! We are pretty good at this!
Phoebs, It's open! It's open!
Hey! So, how was Atlantic City?

Yeah, but still, cheap shot!
All right, gentlemen, you're up first.
Oh, I-I don't think there's any trail.
Who cares? I repel women.
So-so come! Why don't you come?
What, it's gonna be Helen Willick?
Hey you guys I got some bad news.
I think you need to tell her how you feel.
Heavy thing, not getting lighter!
A Play-Dough Barber Shop?
Why does everyone keep saying that?
'Cause, I'm a stupid, stupid man.
Hey! We totally forgot about lunch!
I don't know, but-but look how shiny!
Why does anyone have to be naked?

The guy you gave your number to.
Yes, we have something we have to get to.
Hey, anyone hear from Phoebe yet?

To wear in front of people?

Not just restaurants, from our house.
Open up. We want to talk to you.
Uh, oh-oh, no you didn't. I did.
That was going to be my next argument.
Oh good, you scared me for a minute.
We-we-we-I remember being in a chapel.
Really? You don't think that's a little inappropriate.
Okay. You uh, you wanna hear something weird?
All right Pheebs, your cab's ready.
We'd like to close our accounts.
What'd you do, take him whaling?
Oh. Can I... can I ask who?
One, two, three, four!
Nice to see you again Dr. Green.
Well, uh, do you have a Santa-outfit left?

Thanks. Did you stay here all night?
Um, no, I uh, I have done it before.
Hey, what do you think they're doing in there?
Yes, yes it is. In prison!
So I'm going over to Amanda's tonight!
Besides, there's a big age difference.
Joey, it's Ross! I need some help!
You... you dated Albert Wintermeyer?
It's from Ross, it's a love bug.
Wha, OK, now how do you know that?
Hey, I'm not going to rush into anything!
I cannot sleep in a public place.
So, um, what do you do for a living?
Why would I eat my own arm?
And hey, here's to a lousy Christmas.
And he's, he's a total stranger?
C'mon, seriously, Joey, what's the part?
You keep, you keep... You can't...
Yeah but Phoebs, what about the end?
That's okay, I'll just pick 'em off.
Okay, how about, for a guy, Thatcher?
I know! Don't switch hands, okay?
Just three?! I'm dilated three!
Oh, come on, now you know you want 'em.
Ooh, somebody's getting a little fussy.
Okay I put most of the stuff away.
Yeah-yeah I uh, I have a uh, a guy problem.
How come? Everybody else does.
Well, John McLane had plans!
Dude, that reverse lay-up! Oh...

If you wanna put a label on it.
Which is fine! Because you just turned--twenty-eight!
Why? What-what else could it be?
No-no-no! It's mine! It's-it's mine.
Thanks. I-I think I'm dying. I really do.
Oh yeah, Emily convinced me to do it.

Yeah. Right. Save it. I can do that.
Hi! What are you, what are you doing here?

You can totally, totally live on this.
So uh, he seems like a nice guy.
I'm familiar with his work, yes...
Hero, I uh, I don't know-well, all right.
My foot is stuck in the pocket.
She's putting words in your mouth!
Yes! Ben learned a little trick.
You wanna, you wanna grab some coffee?
Well that's the first time we've said that.
Yes-yes-yes! But, I-I do not love her.
So how many more do you have tomorrow?
Thanks. What photo album was it?
Thank you so much for coming back over.
Pheebs, Pheebs, the babies are coming now.

Someone at work ate my sandwich!
Science. Yeah, I think I've heard of that.
Thanks for the help, problem solved.
Hi, we have a little bathroom emergency.
What about Emma? We don't have a nanny.
I do have a newfound respect for life.
I'm so glad you're going on this trip!
Hey! You wanna live to see your baby?!
Whoa, hello, did you just meet Monica?
You put an offer on a house?
A lot of other gas smells...
Look, I'm sorry, I thought it looked pretty.
Y'know, she tried to undress me too.
Whip it out, whip it out.
It was. It was an amazing night.
Okay, I don't think it's going to pivot anymore.
Come on you guys, it's no big deal!
Yeah, you really sidestepped that land mine.
I just didn't see the fast song coming.
Oh yeah, we're uh, yeah we're not together.
Come here Oh! There she is! Hi!
It's all right! Everything's gonna be all right.
Oh no, yeah no, that part's great!
Oh, that. Umm, she took it really well.
OK, well, um, have a nice evening.
Damn it. It's never off the table.
Calm down, I'm blow drying.
Okay, where in the hell did you get that?!
They kept your room for a while.
Okay, Monica: Right foot red.
You look great. I, uh... I hate that.
Well, I gotta go. Bye. Bye, Rach.
Remember? You-you were eating pizza.
I was talking to myself! You're going down!
Uh actually, I think I'm gonna skip it.
That's okay. We'll talk about something else.
I'm sorry I'm late, did I miss anything?
I just-I-I can't believe she's-she's dating?!
G-gift? The thing's not the gift?
The word you're looking for is 'Anyway'...
Wow! You look nice. What's the occasion?
Uh no-no, she-she's out for the night.
Well, I'm not going to go now anyway .
I'm having a boy! Oh, I'm having a boy!
Hey, I'm more cop than you two!
I see your twenty, raise you twenty-five.
I never did anything with Adrienne Turner.
Joey, what did you think a nubbin was?
What, oh my God. What did you do?
I'm sorry your husband cheated on you.
Well, eww. What? Is it a pimple?
Listen, I um... I heard about the engagement.
Oh! Oh my God! I didn't even see you!
Y'know, I don't think we're going to settle this.
Well, ya know, someone should have called me.
Yes you did, gleba is a word!
Y'know, he hums when he pees!
Yes, yes I am. And you are a....
Are you trying to get me to bribe you?
You uh, you may have been right about Jill.
A bit of a daredevil are we?
Where there is no fear of commitment.
Hi, welcome, to an adult conversation.
Oh no-no-no! Oh-no! No! No! Emily!
W-What was the one right before bananas?
Because it's breast milk. It's gross.
So when do you think you're gonna talk to her?
Chandler's gonna ask Monica to marry him!
It's the museum again, can I, oh.
A superhuman thirst for knowledge.
All right, that's it, I'm getting out of here.
Humm, that sounds, I don't, perfect.
Nonono, thatthat's not what I was saying...
Hey, hey, it's me. Why can't you tell me?
Yeah, yeah! You sure this is what you want?
You've seen it, the Geller Yeller.
Think he washed his hands?
It's nothing, I just gave her a hug.
Take thee, Rachel... Emily. Emily.
OK, I'm gonna go say goodbye to the guys.
This guy could be my baby's stepfather!
Wha... you're uh, you're, you're over me?
Okay, okay. This can go on for a while.
Joey, you shouldn't lie on your resume.
So, so, is Mike coming to dinner?
You were under the pile of coats?
You come out there, you're a dead man.
Oh my God! Rach-Rach, are-are-are you sure?
Sir Limps-A-Lot, I came up with that.
Yeah? Any names come to mind?
Yeah, It's just... I don't think I can do this...
Good, 'cause the ladies, not so much.
Hey, would you ah, would you like some juice?
No one got me an engagement present.
Well, I was gonna say sweet, but yeah-huh!
Hey dude, you okay? Sorry about before.
Rachel, I know that you can. And you should.
Good. Maybe he can switch it back.
Should I leave this open for you too?
Maybe that will liven up this party.
You see, and you thought she'd be judgemental.
Rachel who's carrying my baby? Rachel?
Well this uh, this may be a little awkward.
I'm having a boy! I-I'm having a boy!
Oh, we have to get you an engagement present?
um... I've never heard of a "Boscodictiasaur".
My baby sister, ladies and gentlemen.
Some days it's all I can think about.
Were you the ones called the cops?!
So you took off my pants and shoes?
All right I guess I'm, gonna go pack.
Not since my cop-show got cancelled.
Look, don't worry. Okay? You're gonna be fine.
Oh-ho please. Ask her how?
You let Rachel come back, and it's done.
Okay, I'm going to start climb down you now.
Okay, that's a fire. Oh yeah. Oh yeah.
Go away! I don't want to see anybody.
What? She's gonna eat all those cookies?
Cheater, cheater, compulsive eater.
Y'know what? Just-just follow my lead.
Oh, no, Mom, it's just Monica this year.
Oh, by the way, great service tonight.
You're right, I'm sorry. Will you marry me?
Well, let's just go in there and face them.
Correct! What is Chandler Bing's job?
My mommies love me. That's clever.
Ah, we're out. I sold them all.
Y'know this is actually not a great time for me.
That is an old, Chinese woman!
Why, why, why would you dream that?
Well, Monica keeps changin' the channel.
No really, I-I am! I feel bad!
now I feel terrible this is all my fault.
Wha... What? What would give you that idea?
No, I stayed at Julie's last night.
Yeah. He could row like a viking.
And is a hum, kinda like a scruddle?
Oh oh oh! I RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE!!
And, I came up with Atlantic City.
I-I know. Well if something comes up...
This is it. Unless we're on a break.
Oh my God it's just like I dreamed it!
You know how close women can get.
Oh, ha, I wrote that in one minute.
Shut up! I Dream of Genie!
No. No-no. No. What would you do next?
Mr. Dickens gets to pick 'em.
The big book of childrens' names.
..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he-
Sure! Uh, let me get it for ya.
Oh my god, crap from the street?
Hey, hey. I know you love me. I know you do.
But we do! It's gonna be ok, Rach!
Ya know, maybe, maybe I should just go.
Whew! That was a brisk ride!
My fault?! You threatened the judge!
How come it's not mixing with the water?
I thought it was gonna be a closed casket.
Ma, you're asking me to marry you?
Ah, he didn't uh, take it so well?
Well, Rachel's having drinks with him tonight.
Rachel, come on. Give us a chance.
Home is Home Star stew.
So you wanna watch uh, Entertainment Tonight?
You see Amanda and I have a very special...
How hot do I look in this, huh?!
Mee mee, mee-mee mee.
I'm serious. I just don't trust that guy, okay?
Please, he refers to me as 'wethead'.
Well you sure used a large font.
Marcel! Where are you going with that disc?
Rach, do you uh, are you gonna separate those?
But, um... I don't think that's going to be you.
That-that's always good news. Are you okay?
Well, I'm going to take off. Congratulations man.
It's a legitimate learning technique. Wow!
Phoebe! You and I have never played chess!
Hey, what do you say we celebrate? Champagne?
Monica's big night, she shouldn't pay.
I can't believe they-they didn't even tell us!
I'm getting married today!! Ahh, whoo-hoo!!
Now, how will they know if you're ready?
Sid you lucky deaf bastard.
Yeah, not since I got too strong for you.
No, not since I lost her at the airport.
What are you kidding? It's Batman's tux!!
S-s-smell her hair? What if I did?
Uh Joey, can you give us just a minute?
WE WERE ON A BREAK!!!!!!!
Right. No biggie. Stay loose.
Until we start to look very small.
Uhh, yeah it would! Let's do it!
Come here to me. No-no, you come here to me.
I was just thinking. When my time comes-
Chloe, Chloe how's it coming?!!
That depends, how much did you hear?
So, why is Erica coming to visit?
Hey, that guy did not hypnotise me! Okay.
Hey now! That was an accident, okay.
You didn't tell her?! Okay, fine! Pheebs?
With the belly-button ring? Oh, muhawa!
He's unconscious, I think we'll be just fine!
Oh thank you. Thanks very much. Ow!
Of course, of course, Mr. Stevens.
So let's decide on the spending limit...
You were saying you didn't want to seem stupid.
Yeah, that's kinda what I meant by "bye!"
Paul the Wine Guy, Paul?
Oh my god. You are pure evil.
I uh, I just got back from uh, from Julie's.
I can't believe you told her I was going to propose!
Ranion's theory of species variegation?
I-I just thought you were doing so well. I...
Thank you, but, but you, you gotta leave.
Oh but I-I-I haven't paid you yet!
That uh, that was pretty funny. Wasn't it?
Oh, it's all over everything. Why? Why me?
What should I wear, now I'm all nervous.
Yeah, that's how I know. I'm Ross by the way.
Wow! This picture of you sure is steamy.
Yeah. Everything but, the little blue one.
Well, I'm gonna lie to you Joey, it's a possibility.
Pretty please? Not very uh, 007.
Kinda... spooky without any lights.
C'mon you guys, this is really important to us.
And what did he ask you not to call him?
It's heads. Gentlemen, pick your category.
When I got married you slept with my sister.
Hi. I understand you had a little talk with Emily.
I don't know why you can't admit that you need me.
Well, umm, why don't you give him a call?
You even have to ask?! He is alive!
Nothing, nothing. Everything's under control.
Uh, double latte, extra foam.
But also knowing it means a lot.
Hey. We-we look...we look pretty good.
Did you tell your sister to ask me out?
Guess what? I made Emma laugh today.
No, I barely even got to three Mississippi.
Too little, too late, Benji!
Great! Uh, let me take this up for you.
You've tasted it? You've tasted it.
Hey, when-when was it kicking? What happened?
What? No, no! Hey, hey, hey look...
Uh, we, y'know, we worked things out.
How are we gonna decide who gets this?
Ah, yeah. We had a really good talk.
Phoebe, you can't force kids to be friends.
How are you ever going to sell this place?
What dog? There-there's no dog here.
Really? Its not just frowned upon?
I guess it's here because I GOT TENURE!
Ahh, the one next to my foot. Sorry.
Oh my God, the pages are stuck together!
Yeah I know; he's in Ben's class.
What is Monica's biggest pet peeve?
No. No, I didn't. I didn't want to be that guy.
Look, I uh, I tried not to kiss her, okay?
All right everyone, lift! And slide!!
Isn't Rachel supposed to be back by now?
Y'know, last night was embarrassing for you too.
Oh, you like it? You wanna know where I got it?
11, unbelievable, 11 is correct.
I'm Ross, Phoebe's friend from the coffeehouse.
Not-not really. Th-th-there was just Carol.
Yeah, I ate all my gifts for everybody.
We were all pretty shaken up about it.
And here's little Ben nodding off...
I'm sorry Rach, it was, it was really close.
And, and uh, you-you remember my friend Chandler.
The way he makes me feel about myself.
Yes, it's a deadly but beautiful sport.
Fine, we'll call the next one Ella.
Hi. I'm Ross Geller. I live in the building.
I tell you, I've never seen him this happy.
You know sometimes your words... they hurt.
Wait a minute, is this, is this for real?
See, I would never snap at you like that.
Yeah, kids say all kinds of crap.
We're just tryin' to do a nice thing here.
All right! You go get him! Let's go!
Anyway, umm so I was um, I was hiking...
Oh! Got 'em right here, check!
What? Of course you can! Hop on!
All right. I'll uh, I'll see you later, okay?
It gives it a nice antiquey look.
Ok! So let's move on to the Renaissance?
Thank you for bringing her into our lives.
Uh...lately, she just likes hanging out here.
You know what I like most about him, though?
That's right! That's right, don't you play a woman?
Just admit it Chandler, you have no backhand.
Hey, what'd you guys do to get up on there?
I knew it. So, is she someone from work?
I- I think they're great! I, I really do.
Uh-oh, saved by the bell. Hello?
Phoebe, you can't massage people in my apartment!
Six months Rachel, six months.
What? Come on Rach, tell me what you're thinking?
I don't even wanna know about the dark cheese.
Five years?! Chandler you have to tell him!
Rachel!! Wow! You, uh, you look, wow!
A lesson in the importance of unagi.
Aw-oh, that's right. Are-are you gonna be okay?
Her date tipped me ten dollars.
Right. I guess, I guess I should call Emily.
Just can't believe I'm in Rachel Green's room.
Yeah, Charlie is gonna be joining my department.
So you wanna buy a house in the 50's?
I'm telling you, just a little bit at a time.
Amy, I ju... I just... I just wanna...
Oh, yeah, hello, well, now, here I am.
Wha-What did he say that was so funny?
Well, these. These are yours right here.
Why?! How?! How is he a genius?
Hey! Sorry I kept you waiting so long.
You understand I don't actually like 8-year-old boys.
Oh my God! Thank you! Thank you so much!
And, I don't know, if it starts to rain...
Hey! So uh, was he excited about the tickets?
Yeah. She's putting her down now, that's her.
Yeah, well maybe Phoebe will switch with me.
That commercial always makes me so sad.
Hi Aunt Lisa, Uncle Dan.
Just stuff. Y'know kinda what Emily wants.
Yes, but I don't wanna die in your cab!
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What's with the tackling?
Don't you realise what you're-you're doing to yourself?
I just...I have to find out how it went.
Sweetie, calm down, it's gonna be okay.
It didn't spend much time on the wall!!!
Whoa! Hey! Whoa-whoa-whoa, you saw her breast?!
I mean, why not! I mean, I mean why not?!
No, he's at uh, Carol's and Susan's today.
Did you just say "break up with Charlie"?
We have got to start locking that door!
Santa was unavailable so close to Christmas.
That's Ben, my son from my first marriage.
Just a sandwich. Turkey, a little mustard...
All we're saying is don't rush into anything.
Huh? Yeah, fine, invite whoever you want.
Wow! Umm, okay uh...everyone...this...is Isabella. What?
Let's celebrate with some maple candy!
Oh no! Hey-hey, I'm the guy! I'll get it.
Oh, Believe me, the ladies, they love it!
Uh actually Joey, it's the Cretasous period.
Oh, God. I forgot how hot she was!
Fine, two tickets, I need two tickets.
Not my first time in a hotel, my friend.
Hey, I married a lesbian to make you look good!
Oh! Y'know, I've got an extra futon.
Oh. Thanks. Uh, has anyone seen Rach?
Emily, hi! Uh, how-how was you flight?
That must be our alcohol and beers!
Rach, you can't look fat in an x-ray.
Well, Emily's willing to work on the relationship.
Uh, Eddie something. He just met him.
Look, is Rachel here? I really need to talk to her.
You were backpacking across Western Europe?
Well, I-I gotta go break up with Bonnie.
No, no, I mean, I mean a thing on my body.
I think it means he freaked out and left!
Ok, odd thing to get excited about!
Wow! That aspirin dance really works!
Well, there goes my whole belief system.
At least tell me where you hid it.
No the man's right, that's what I had with Rachel.
What, what do you mean, what? Is he gay?
Hey, divorced men are not bad men!
What? Sophie, does she have ten minutes?
Okay, look, he's not gonna hurt them, right?
Wow, I hadn't thought of that. I hope not.
It does. It really and truly does.
No, not this time. So... what'd you have?
Was there anything you did wrong with Emma?
We have to stop them before something happens!
It's laundry. The thinking through is minimal.
Listen Adrienne, you can't tell Chandler about this.
Come on Rach, you don't have what, ten minutes?
Wow, uh, Joey that's-that's great. Thanks man.
So, uh, does it do anything, you know, special?
Yeah. I guess I can cut him some slack.
OH! SON OF A BITCH!
Okay, uhm... Hey, you guys seen Joey anywhere?
Why? Why would I why? Why? Why? Why?
Really like those Macadamia nuts, huh?
Guess whose middle name is Muriel.
Hey you guys, I need some fashion advice.
So, uh, why did you have to turn it down?
Well, what about me?! I'm a medical marvel!!
Looks to me like he's the one getting the job.
Yeah, I have a question. When is this gonna air?
And Mon, you wanna live with Chandler, don't ya?
And it'll be cool to see it again! Yeah!
Ezel! Hey Gunther! You're an ezel!
Hey! How long until Pete's fight?
I got mugged. And they stole my pocket.
You've never said that in your life, have you?
It's not something you are! It's something you have!
After what I did? Can you blame her?
Don't ask me, I had it and I blew it!
I'm divorced! I'm only 26 and I'm divorced!
You know what, you guys, we don't have to watch this.
Well, I... I am having a good hair day.
We, we just decided to uh, to go for it.
Just a high pitched intimidating noise.
Fine. Fine, alright, now you'll never know.
Look, I'm sorry but you-you-you better go Pheebs.
I've said it! Okay?! But it's over Joey!
I don't know, are we just kissing guys on balconies?
Julie, can you hold this for a second, thanks.
Okay. Yeah, I guess, I guess I could do that too.
So, where did you get your undergraduate degree?
It's been six months! I'm always hot!
You couldn't let me have her, could ya?!
Four letters: "Circle or hoop".
What about the time I said we were on a break?
Phoebe, you were sure Ben was gonna be a girl.
Put it back exactly where you found it?
Come on. All right, here we go. All right?
Yeah, and I'm responsible for just like half of that.
Yeah, how does Jason look in a v-neck?
Nothing, I'm-I'm just, I'm so comfortable with you!
Go over there and tell that woman the truth.
Elizabeth, thank God! I was just thinking about...
It's a clown kit! Clown kit!
Uh, yeah, I'll take a coffee. Thanks, man.
Didn't you spend last night at Joey's?
Bumming hard, guys, bumming hard.
Yeah, it'll be like a funny Thanksgiving story!
Yeah? Joey really knows his art, huh?
Well, I was thinking of taking Emma to the playground!
Okay, um... I don't want her watching our baby.
Now, do you have any idea what you just said?
Better not be doin' these in order.
Well that brings me in the loop a little.
Most of you don't know me, I'm Rachel's boyfriend.
Yeah, well... I think I know how to dazzle him.
Yes, that's what I have. It's not on the board.
So, Rach, y'know-y'know how Emily's coming right?
yeah I really, really need to talk to you about something.
Yes, that's what I was going to ask, thank you.
We can still catch that Ukrainian film.
Rach we have a code brown situation.
B, B, B, B, B!
Well, c'mon. Don't ya want to find out?
Ugh, she's saying good-bye to her uncle.
Uh, uh, well you're, umm, you're my lobster.
So you gonna invite us all to the big opening?
Y'know what? I don't like you without mom. Come on.
Ah, somebody's at the door on the ceiling.
We think Chandler might be having an affair.
Hey Rach, can I talk to you outside for a second?
Boy, we uhm... hadn't really thought of that.
Uhm... Rachel and I hired a male nanny.
About yesterday, I was really wrong. I am sorry.
C'mon, this was a pact! This was your pact!
Dad, I beg you not to finish that sentence.
Oh thank God, I thought she had two heads.
I mean, I don't feel like I even have a girlfriend anymore.
Oh, hey, hey Rach, do you notice anything..ahh...
Hey. How did, uh, how'd it go today?
No, it was a mistake! I made a mistake! Okay?
Wow! Sorry. So uh, how are the new people?
Y'know what? You're just upset because you're losing.
You're right. There isn't a decent outlet.
Yes Mr. Lewis, how can I help you?
Oh, she didn't think it would be that big of deal.
Wha..? I need 6 graduate students.
There was no song. There was no song!
Then how do you explain the toe ring?!
Nothing, nothing. Lee-lo, the laundry's done.
Hi! Sorry I'm late. Were you sleeping?
Damnit! I'll put a candle on the cake.
Alright you know, why don't I just meet you upstairs.
Oh, sorry. Well, look, maybe I can help you with it.
Excuse me, do any of you know how to play?
Before I forget, are we hitting faces?
I'm understanding, but let's not get carried away.
Hey, how'd the date go with Mr. Millionaire?
Hey, hey, hey, that's not the rule and you know it.
You ever figure out what that thing's for?
OK, fine, well I'm not gonna watch, alright.
But, you, you don't want to seem too pushy.
How's Monica coming along with her vows?
I think it's the sugar, could you hold the apple?
Of course I am! Okay, let's go godfather.
Rach, you can't call people at three in the morning.
Yep! Yeah, see this says D-13, and uh...
I can't believe it! He's looking right at us!
All right look, I-I realize it upsets you.
I love you too, and I'm never letting you go again.
What?! What do you mean? You-you-you're not pregnant?
Fine by me; hope she wins.
No, of course not! ...Yeah, yeah, it is.
Well, if-if she thought they were on a break...
No, no, no, you can't take the remote control!
Wait! Whoa-whoa, you...you gave her the ring?
Yeah! Yeah! Oh, this will make a great memory.
Susan is Carols, Carols, Carols, friend...
Guys? There's a somebody I'd like you to meet.
I had a 'K'. Where's where's my 'K'?
So you're just like a... guy who's a nanny?
I don't, I don't think we've meet. I-I'm Ross.
Who gets whom. I don't know why I do that.
Oh wow, yeah! See, I did not get that.
You wanna watch Laverne y Shirley?
Well, I guess we could tape Entertainment Tonight.
I find Marion's views far to progressionist.
But, won't she notice I have makeup on?
What a weird way to kick me when I'm down.
Of course she would, you're a college man.
That's funny...Do you think you'll ever work again?
I'm sorry, it's just... how did you get so tan?
That's right good things, that-that is what I said.
Hey, what are you guys, what are you guys talking about?
People are doing it in front of my book!
Okay, I'll have the fixed salad and the duck.
Well sure. But I get married all the time so...
Oh! I thought you guys got married in uh, January?
Okay, I think I might know why my parents don't like you.
I'm trying to tell you I made you a mix tape.
Well I'm sorry but, that-that's really not my problem.
Uh, yeah, yeah I'll, I'm right behind you.
Rach, Rach, I am so sorry. I am so-so sorry.
It's possible, they have really sharp edges.
A loser you did it with 298 times!
Then you should have said something before I met her.
Hey, y'know, this is so not what I needed right now.
Yeah, that's the one. Listen, I don't want to hurt her.
No! No no, it is nothing like me and Carol!
Um, see, but that's not the final draft.
With the circus? He's behind the elephant.
But-but Cailin, he definitely will scream.
Sorry, I'm sorry. Close, close, close...
Hi, I'm selling Brown Bird cookies.
Oh... Little heads-up would have been nice.
Hey-hey-hey, when uh, when were we on a boat?
Uh, I'm not really a shot drinking kinda guy.
Okay, but do you really need another friend? I mean...
You may want to lose the foam finger!
I'm sorry the answer there would be...none of us.
Um, in Phoebe's room. You can't go in there.
I can't believe you put that on my alumni page!
Oh, god. You know, this is still pretty hot.
Yeah. There's no breaking them up, is there?
He's right, even if it's to say something complementary.
Okay, please-please Paul, just let me explain...
I gave him an extremely professional massage!
You don't know?! Rach, you balded my girlfriend!
Yeah. Listen, can you keep this information to yourself?
Hey, I brought the camera for Emma's video.
Well, then, maybe it's time we all moved on.
Man! Did you see the kid on that nose?
Well hey, who did these resumes for ya?
Just showing you my run-of-the-mill-slice-it-right-off third nipple.
Because it's soft... Hey, so how was your date?
Whoa-oh, okay! Yeah, why am I telling you that?
What, you didn't get it? The doctor is a monkey.
Oh, why don't you make her one of your little jokes.
Oh hey, show them the picture of your uterus.
Come on, I'm your older brother, ask me!
That's less embarrassing, yes. Yes I was.
Well, she'll call back, don't be such a baby.
You had a rough day, huh.. c'mere.
Correct. Her actual favorite movie is...
Easy. Easy. You have to go to the hospital. Okay?
Do you mind if I sit here for a sec.?
Wow, it, it's neat learning about submarines.
WHAT THAT'S A REAL NAME!
Good morning. Nice breasts by the way.
Ohh, man! Chicago, is sooo lucky!
Hotel? Why isn't she staying with you guys?
Hey, y'know, y'know what would make me really happy?
Yeah, it's really 6:00 tomorrow night our time.
Come on, you made coffee! You can do anything!
Of course I am. I just have to make a call.
They're towing a car. And I am seeing...spots.
That's nice. Get out Let's go, come on.
Ok, do you have any ideas for any openers?
Oh, tell me, tell me, is everything, uhh....?
Sweetie, don't worry you'll get picked. Chandler.
You're never going to guess who I just saw downstairs!
I know, but it's still worth mentioning, I think.
I don't think so. Hello? When you get in there...
Y'know what? Y'know what? Rachel, just-just drop it.
Chandler was hitting on the hot delivery girl!
No, I-I thought it would be more fun this way.
Ah Joey, I don't think you get to pick the cities.
Uh no, no just-just that he is a great guy.
Anyone else? Huh? Bring 'em on!
Is there blood coming out of my ears?
So five of us is, $33.50 apiece.
Uh, actually these might look pretty good on me.
Hello, it's us, all right? It'll be fine.
Hey, hey, Yertle the Turtle. A classic.
And if you wait right here, I'll go get Ross.
Um, I do not want her baby-sitting our child.
Hey...! Rachel and I hired a male nanny.
Hey, if that's what you want to do I'm not gonna say no.
Uh-huh. Yeah I-I have a knack for impressions.
Hi. I-I hear you're going on a ferry tonight.
Yeah, you got it right? You got it right? You got it?
That's great! So you're staying in New York!
You'll see. Okay. Oh, what's-what's her name?
What? NO! I am not going to give them Ben!
Umm... Wow! That's-that's some pricey nut!
Rach, I got a message from you. Who's Michael?
Well, maybe he just didn't want to hurt your feelings.
So Pheebs, are you gonna go back out there or what?
Is that funny? Am I supposed to be laughing?
Crack isn't even an intravenous drug!
Posting that I died? That really isn't funny.
Maybe I should open a divorced men's club.
Too far, Amy. Too far.
I honestly don't know if I'm hungry or horny.
Shh! Of course, why don't we go inside?
So, I uhm... kinda need to talk to you about Charlie.
Oh really? What uh, what does he want with her?
Well, we're all here! I guess we should get going!
What, I mean, a little, but no, what, go on.
If you want to check your email, just ask!
Shh. Do you want cran-apple or cran-grape?
So, Dr. Green, how's the old boat.
Dad, we-we can't believe you're selling the house.
I'm telling you, there's no way he's moving back.
Ah well, can't blame a guy for trying!
Oh well, I guess I'll catch up with her later.
Breathe! Breathe! Breathe throw the pain.
I'm sorry, Chandler but this, this is really important to me.
Unbelievable. She says goodbye to everyone but me.
Oh God. Y'know, botanists are such geeks.
Okay, look, I-I know what you guys are going to say...
No I don't, to hell with her, she left me!
I, I just never think of money as an issue.
Can we, can we just forget this ever happened?
Hey, I know what'll get us up on a platform!
Hey Joey, how come our stuff isn't free?
Okay, Monica. Mon, uh what-what you just saw...
It felt like a 'big guy' moment.
I know! I'm saying you have to watch them all the time.
Rach, y'know I can see you naked any time I want.
Phoebe, oh my God! Wh-wh-what are you doing here?
It's really a uh-uh three person game, y'know?
That's my favorite shirt! Okay? I love that shirt!
Hey Rach, can you pass me the TV Guide?
'That' would be Marcel. You wanna say hi?
Look, I-I'm really sorry I let go of the bike.
Science...? Academia...? Being a good father...?
Rach, come on, look, I know how you must feel.
Well, then that guy is in serious, serious trouble.
No I don't want to play video games, Joey!
Okay, you don't have to stop, I'm invisible, I'm not here.
Sorry, I'm kinda keeping this one on the Q.T.
So, then you can stay as long as you want.
I'm sorry Chandler, but this, this is really important to me.
Nooo, I had to return it to the costume place.
I'm not going nuts. Do you see me go nuts?
And that is why we cannot see each other anymore.
That's easy for you to say, you found one already.
Hey Rach, can you grab me a cup of coffee?
Yes. I was just warming up the earpieces for you.
Lighter than air... But that's not the point.
Did you um-I'm sorry, did you just say it's Rachel?
Okay I-I just have to stop by my place first.
Because tomorrow he's redoing yesterday's pages.
C'mon, cut. Cut, cut, cut,...
Thirty seconds, all the questions you can answer.
Okay, Pheebs: Right hand blue. Good.
Monica couldn't tell time 'til she was 13!
Rach! Wait! The men's room is that way.
I can do that. Oh-oh, what if she gets upset?
It makes him miss the bowl, but whatever.
Dad so what we have to pretend that we're married?
Okay. So uh, well, this-this is uh, this is awkward.
Okay, then why do you have to wear underwear tonight?
Every day is Lesbian Lover Day.
I don't get it. What do you see in this guy, anyway?
Well, unless you make some kind of big gesture.
Oh yeah-No-You're welcome. We'll talk about it later.
I-I'm sorry Rach, I didn't know. Are you gonna be okay?
Look, you'll get there. You're an amazing chef.
Oooohhh, I'll bet she's one of those people.
You entered Emma into a Beauty Pageant?
Yeah, okay, hold on! They're not coming on man.
Yes, but I've lived here for 25 minutes.
I can't believe this, I thought we were all in this together!
Uhh, it was fun. We, we just had coffee.
Oh. Oh. Well I uh, I brought her some bloemen.
Monica, come on now. Let's go, baby coming.
That's right. The student has become the master.
Damn! I can't believe I took her off my list.
Uh, that, that, that would be a judgment call.
You're right, thanks for keeping me honest dad.
Okay, okay. Look, you have got to go to a doctor! Okay?
What? No! No, I'm not stopping. I'm Red Ross!
So, um... where did Paolo come from?
Either that or my mouth is getting smaller.
Oh, shhh, shh. Magic is about to happen.
...now remember you have to imagine me in a kilt.
Well just hold him like you'd hold a football.
I'm just so happy you guys are finally getting a kid.
Why don't we talk about this on the way to the hospital?
Yeah, you're right, thanks Pheebs, I'm gonna go find her.
Not even, say, breaking up with Janice?
I'm finding it really hard not to mess with him.
I-I uh, I got tricked into all those things!
Would you all relax? It's not that big a deal.
Well, whatever it is I'm-I'm very, very sorry. Okay?
Hey... there's sensitive... and there is too sensitive.
Hey I uh just picked up Ben from school...
All right that's, that's it!! Get off her!
I can't belive you two had sex in her dream.
That doesn't sound like you... That's Monica talking!
No. No, no. She doesn't want to see you right now.
Yep, and you know what other holiday is coming up?
Great! Great! You're making the bike very happy.
Hey, I didn't know we were, uh, seeing other people.
Did homo-erectus hunt with wooden tools?
Right. Ohh! You-you want me to be your backup.
You weren't trying to entice me with your nakedness.
No, no, that won't be ah, that won't be necessary
Did Rachel tell you we hired a male nanny?
Yeah, which she probably stole from some cheerleader.
No-no it's not. What-what happened there Ned?
Really? Sounded like Three Blind Mice.
Ehh, I was just, I was just thinking about your father.
Right? And this! She-she could've won this!
D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help?
Rachel, I can see you dialing! I don't understand why...
Yeah, see.. you took mine. Chandler, what about you?
Of course not, I'm... suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch.
Uh yeah! Let me, let me get that for you.
I had to talk loud because the movie was loud!
Yeah, we thought we had a monkey, but we-we didn't.
Yeah I am! Yeah, Ben got a second audition!
Let's not talk about losing. Just deal the...
Hey, there's Missy Goldberg. You gotta remember her.
I'm not! I'm making it easier! Pick me!
You sang Baby Got Back didn't you?
How did you know she would buy scotch tape?
Yeah, so uh, is it sore or can you do stuff?
It's a car Monica! Not a rocket ship!
Wait a minute, does-does everyone feel this way?
Getting it away from me would be job one.
So, thanks so much for bringing her to the hospital.
And in about five seconds you're gonna see why.
Yeah, that's true. Except I don't wanna get over her.
Oh, what are you going to do, follow me down there?
Uh, Macy's, third floor, home furnishings.
But, what's great is that you don't mind talking about it.
Well, I still think I was right about that whole Mark thing.
But if I hadn't walked in here, would you..?
Look, this is a disaster! Can't I please just go?
Okay, I'm done with my choices, these are final.
Mm-hmm. She's-she's emotional, but, but ballsy.
Phoebe, there is no secret. Okay? I didn't propose.
Oh man, I can't believe you guys are leaving this place.
No. They swoop in and steal your jackpot.
Correct. Rachel claims this is her favorite movie...
Here, check it out. It's the first one, too.
Ok... now... now we're just holding hands!
That's interesting, but check this out. I date her...
Well, I'm-I'm just glad I could, y'know, help you out.
"...subcategories. The first of these subcategories is..."
I tired attacking two women, did not work.
Yeah, you too. Man, so-so what are you up to?
Okay, well, we'll call the company that sent her!
Uh sweetie, maybe you'd be more comfortable here?
That's the hope! So, is Emma awake yet?
Well, I mean if uh, if Emily gave me a choice...
There you go! Good enough for your party, huh?
I had just moved in. Thank you! Listen umm...
Oh! Well then this is awkward. So what do you uh...
Okay. You can feel all the bones in your skull.
And then Rachel wasn't sure she could leave the baby.
Hey... I made up that joke and told it to you!
Oh what are you kidding? She's gorgeous, it's all Rachel.
No!! No!! I wanna stay. I wanna talk about this.
Oh yeah? no, no Nobel Prizes for him?
And you had no idea they weren't getting along?
Joey, you owe $1100 at I Love Lucite.
Okay, hopefully this time mom won't boo you.
Nooo!! Gandolf?! Gandolf is coming to town?
Yeah... what am I going to say to Kenneth Schwartz?
Wha, heh, how could you know, I don't even know!
Monica, whatever you do, do not drop that ball!
Yeah, yes it is, I was just moistening the tip.
I just wanna read something. It's your pro list.
Who would you rather be Simon or Garfunkle?
Uh okay, well there's-there's wine in the kitchen.
Rach! Whoops! Rach, hey, open up, please!
Momentary lapse. Don't-don't you have any self-control?
I hope you cleaned your hair out of the drain.
Alright. : Your money's mine, Green.
I went to that tanning place your wife suggested.
Well that's fine with me. Could use the money.
That's a good question, dad. That's a good question...
My best friend and my sister! I cannot believe this.
Where'd you get fruit at four in the morning?
No you didn't. You said you would, but you never did!
Hey, say something to Emma on her 18th birthday!
Women tell each other everything. Did you know that?
No need to point, she knows who Ross is.
Fine, fine, Rachel your with Monica, Joey you're with me.
Shame on you! Ugly baby judges you!
Hey, if there is ever, anything I can do for you...
Okay. Thanks you guys. Pheebs are you wearing fur?
Oh, see from where I was sitting I uh. . .
Wait! No! Ben, come here! I am not kidding!
Will you make the mashed potatoes with the lumps?
Nothing, it's just that hypnosis is beyond crap.
And when we were dating we consummated like bunnies!
That is really nice...lying! No way is that the reason!
Female body inspector? What size is that?
Ok, would people stop drinking the breast milk?
Hey! So ah, what did the insurance company say?
This is so cool. You're actually gonna be on television.
Hmph. So what you, you tell each other everything?
Why-why can't you take a couple of days off?
No really, I mean, I mean, God, I could use a friend.
Hey, when did you and Susan meet Huey Lewis?
Okay, you wanna play rough, we can play rough.
No! No it's not. Joey, this is a smart idea.
You're just saying that 'cause I said no to your name!
No! That would be stupid! You're having it for me!
That's impossible, he's got a twinkie in the city.
No but...but still you can't possibly do this alone.
Oh, fire! There, there's a fire! Fire!!
Wow! It looks like we got a lot of good stuff.
Check it out, he actually is the MonkeyShine monkey.
Yeah, it's no big deal. It's just a blind date.
What? What? Was that a joke? 'Cause it's mean.
Not hating Yanni is not a real reason.
Why- why- why would he need a blade?
What a beautiful story. Hey, I'm fine by the way.
No, no, NO, you cannot go to dinner with him.
Thank you Gunther. We didn't want to have to go and do that.
No. No, uh, Phoebs? You can'tyou can't do...
Uh-huh, that's why they call it Staten Island.
Stop going through my stuff ! Rachel: Hey!
Wait, how do you zoom out? There she is.
Oh-oh, Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger.
Rach, I think you're reading a little too much into it.
Always a great way to get in a man's pants.
Hey, you guys won't believe what I have to do for work today.
What?! What does he want?! I wasn't doing anything!
Ah. Joey you're-you're having lunch with my mom?
You've been quiet all morning. Is everything okay?
I've got to talk to her. Ugh, I hate this part.
Okay enough! This is, this is not going to happen.
Who wants to make some long distance calls?
Oh. (He takes the picture and hugs her.
Well, I kinda half to. I mean, because the thing is...
I guess he musta gotten the part in that play.
But it absolutely didn't. It didn't!! It didn't!!
Uh, Pheebs, some people call that breaking and entering.
Well, technically it seven billion years ago...
10 seconds, you need this or you lose the game.
I can't believe in four weeks they're gonna be married!
Look, Mon, do you want us to uh, come back later?
Is that-are you saying yes? Is that yes?
I've got to say you guys, that's an incredible gesture!
Uh, excuse me, uh, where can we find the monkey?
I mean, uh, who... who cares about a little sloppiness?
Come on, come on, we're-we're-we're lighting the candles!
Monica, if you want, I can lend you some money.
Really? I mean, I, I had a whole speach prepared.
Yes! You're the person who checked out my book?!
Hey, wait! Wait-wait-wait! Joey, did you propose to her?
So, listen guys, are we uh, are we ok here?
What, we-uh- we don't have shoes here, or...?
All right, I gotta go. I'm taking Ben to the park.
Well, that's what I'm here for. Want me to get that?
That's okay Rach, we're not liking Ross right now.
Oh perfect, we were just gonna see if you wanted to go.
Ah, actually, I'm sorry we-we probably should get going.
One-Mississippi, two-Mississippi, switch! Switch! Switch!!
What, are we keeping Thanksgiving a secret this year?
Well if you can't remember, can't we just forget about this?
You tryin' to be clever? A funny lady?
No problem. I cannot wait for you to meet my friends.
Yeah, but when the baby comes she's gonna want to move.
Cousin Frannie's wedding, its tomorrow night.
I'm sorry. It's just that this is the worse Thanksgiving ever.
Oww!! Son of a...!! Ow! Come on!
Did you tell him about my thquirt gun idea?
Yep, we got it, we got it. Thank you so much.
Uhh, believe me when he's older, he'll understand.
How, how, um how can you not be going?
Monica you really think I should try this phasing out thing?
Professor Neuman, the head of the department, so....
I hope you're a better father than you're a friend!!
Joey! The vet said it's a simple procedure.
So you guys, who else did you tip with cookies?
Y'know, hey! You're the one who ended it, remember?
So, do you get colours or just French tips?
Yours, I just got 43 points for 'KIDNEY'.
Joey! Hey, I need to talk to Charlie. Is she there?
Yeah? What about ah, that bike messenger you hit?
OK you...you really don't know what I am talking about?
Hey! Uh, I thought, I thought you were at table six.
I am this close to tugging on my testicles again.
I can't believe you let George Michael slap you.
Actually, do you guys mind staying here for a while?
Well we just wanted to stop by and uh, say goodnight.
She's not- past, she's present, she's back.
Uhm, ministers don't ride the subway for free.
Oh please! You're gonna say things now, aren't ya?
So uh, any ideas for the bachelor party yet?
Yes. I find it to be something of a conversation piece.
Great. He's doing great. Don't you worry about Chandler.
Calm down. There's no reason to get testy.
Look Emily, I'm just having dinner with my friends, okay?
Oh hey, that was a good one, huh? Help! Help!
Ok. No, hey, whoa, whoa, I'll get your coat.
Oh, umm, I'm just getting rid of a couple of things.
I see... Thanks very much. Is this your son?
Then talk to him! He might be fine with it.
It's winter, they are fewer people on the street.
Umm, oh, hey, I don't know. How about a big one?
Carol our sex life is-it's just not working...
Yes, yes of course, what-what would this be regarding?
Oh, it's fine. Actually, I, I invited Mike over.
The girl on the cover with her nipples showing?
Look it's the artist formerly known as Chandler.
What? You - you're making money off my misery?
The nurse said they're bringing in another woman.
Is the old woman on the bicycle still alive?
Let's grab our stuff and get the hell out of here.
I guess it all started when Rachel got this new job.
There might be, a teeny, tiny, possibility.
Fine. I just need to know that you're not gonna tell your sister.
No, no it's, um, it's not you, um, it's um, it's
Ah, the forbidden love of a man and his door.
The guy on the cover with his nipples showing?
Oh hi! Ross Geller. And this is my friend Phoebe.
Excellent! How do you put a baby down for a nap?
Yes, I did, I did! I should have written it down!
O-kay. Well, I'm gonna go grab us some breakfast.
What's going on, is... uh, Bobby drinking again?
Yeah, either that, or he has a really big cat.
Ok, no, no, you hang up. You, you, y-
Ok, no, no, you hang up. You, you, y...
Oh, just this woman that I met last night at the party.
Ahh. Ooh, is this a ah, is this a bad time?
Uberveiss. It's new, it's German, it's extra-tough.
And it could've just as easily have been a bullet.
Hey listen I uh, talked to Chandler, sorry about the movie.
You were the 200-pound 11-year-old who rode her!
You're not serious, I mean, you really... you really talk to it?
C'mon, Chandler, I love your mom. I think she's a blast.
Right. Right, okay, okay. I'm sorry. I'm sorry I yelled.
Umm, Jo's a girl, it's short for Josephine.
So, what are you guys doing four weeks from today?
I think this is it. I don't know, maybe we should keep looking.
Oh, eh, just thinking about Emily getting married tomorrow.
I meant because the monkey in it reminds me of Marcel.
What about Ben? We can't bring a baby to a hospital.
I wanna be buried at sea, it looks like fun.
Well, this is what happens when people live on the edge!
We're still married! Don't tell Rachel. See you later.
Oh I, I don't-I don't think that would be the best idea.
Look, I didn't recognize it without that inflatable sheep.
You know what, if you wanna look for a house, that's okay.
So you said yes to him, and you just had our baby?
It would be so cool to live across from you guys!
Uh-huh. But it was a first for the rest of my building.
And that's bad because..., you hate chicken piccata?
Fine, I-I give up. Santa, Santa can stay.
No-no, it's not that, it's just... I-I just moved in.
Uh Mr. Morse, can I speak to you for a moment?
Molly, ah, do you mind giving us just a minute?
Hey are you getting Monica and Chandler an engagement present?
Hey Pheebs, you gonna have the rest of that Pop-Tart?.. Pheebs?
Yeah, I kind of uh, have something else planned for you guys.
Do you realize I have a classroom full of students?
So Pheebs, how long is your mom gonna be with us?
Oh! Oh my God oh! Oh my God she's here.
Uhh, not much. You guys want to see a movie tonight?
Ok. Let's see. Oh, you should take her to the MET!
So Rachel, what're you, uh... what're you up to tonight?
Touched. Used. Sat on. Sleep on.
Oh, wow! I should get going. I-I got a date tonight.
We said it was only going to be two weeks, y'know?
Okay, I have to do something. I mean, I have, I have to stop it!
Great, great, and I miss that too, I miss everything.
Woah, ho-ho, whad'ya got there, a weapon?
Yeah? Hop on. Is the pretty lady looking?
So, uh, Rachel, what are you, uh, what're you doing tonight?
She doesn't know she was fired yet, does she?
Hi! Hi! Hi. Has umm, anyone seen Chandler?
It's a blanket Joe, not a cloak of invisibility!
I could put uh-uh a basketball court in the back.
Anyway, uhm...Well, I'm glad there's no hard feelings.
No-no-no! Only if I promise never to see Rachel again.
Okay, I think we're getting into a weird area here...
You're gonna love me so much. I got Sting tickets!!
I just, I had to see you one more time before you took-off.
Now you guys just got married, why is she so depressed?
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. We're not 13 anymore.
I can't believe you'd rather go out with him than me.
Oh, please. I am not singing to your stomach, ok?
Sure, your dresser is missing but this she notices.
Uh. Would you guys mind giving us a minute?
We have 8:00 reservations at Grammercy Bistero.
Oh, just planning my bachelor party with my best man.
Just some boys gave me their phone numbers.
Look, this is hard enough! I really need you guys right now.
Okay, I'm gonna play my sperm card one more time.
I got it. Uh, Joey, women don't have Adam's apples.
Yeah, it's hard okay, I only have two spots left.
Hey! Hey, look! Ugly Naked Guy's back!
Oh. How do you uh, ya know, keep it so neat?
He told you everything! I mean you totally cracked him!
I'm-I'm gonna wear this all the time! I love this shirt!!
Hey, let's bring the rest of these down to the truck.
Wow, you ah, you really like all this space stuff, huh?
You really thought "Science Boy" was worth saving!
Now I'm depressed! ... Even more than I was.
I'd better not found you naked in my hotel room!
Oh it's okay. They're just-they're just wrapping her up.
I just found out that Elizabeth's dad wants to meet me.
Oh, now, don't listen to him, Pheebs, I think it's endearing.
That, that's the only thing the zoo's ever told me.
So if you take this job you'll be moving to Paris?
I thought, uh... it was a fifty cent limit.
Y'know what? Fine! Get attacked! I don't even care!
Well, I don't know.... huh-huh.... but I'm hoping huh-huh.
Hey, would it be okay if I wrote a song about this.
No, no. Uh... no, see, uh, you-you can't do that.
Oh, oh, you're... uh... you're, oh you're the date.
Wh-why?! Why-why-why would it, why would it be weird?
How could you not get it? You were Santa last year.
I think It's the most beautiful table I've ever seen.
Okay Ben, Santa has to go. Say good-bye!
OK, my hands were no where near your butt.
Come on Rach, you can't even eat alone in a restaurant.
I was doing great with Julie before I found out about you.
Ah, the lesser-known "I don't have a dream" speech.
Great! Because Emily and I are getting married in a month!
Well umm, I've been doing a lot more of my kara-tay.
Chandler, what kind of an idiot do you take me for?
You know? Come to think of it, it does feel Rubella-like!
And-and to years of hard work finally paying off.
The necklace I got you was gold, this one is silver.
Whoa-hello! We were closer with the mixed tape.
Yeah? Me too. Gettin' a little tired though.
Well, it was the only thing to do there that didn't have a line.
So Rach, maybe you and I could fly out together Saturday.
A tattoo? Why, why would you want to do that? Hi.
When you thought Joey proposed did...did you say yes?
The one that always stares at me when I come in?
Come on! All the cool kids are eating 'em!
That was the only way I could get him to stop typing!
Ok, just, just remember how crazy I am about you, ok?
I uh, I don't know, I guess I'm just gonna see, see what happens.
15 more seconds, 14, 13, 12...
God that is the most beautiful engagement ring ever!
No, no, no, no! Don't tell me! I don't want to know!
I uh... I don't know. I mean I...I honestly didn't watch it.
You don't-you don't want to hear about my dream Officer...Pretty?
They, uh, were infected. He wouldn't have made it.
All I have to do is close my eyes. See? Woo-hoo!!
Damn! I thought that was going to be romantic as hell!
I can't believe Rachel just moved on and didn't say anything to me.
I know nothing! Mike's a great guy, it was hypothetical!
Well, it had some good ideas, take off your shirt.
Yeah. Anyway umm, it probably worked out for the best.
I guess if everybody else is... Closing credits.
Thanks for letting me tag along tonight you guys.
I made her favorite, tuna salad with pickles.
I'd like to return this couch. I'm not satisfied with it.
My marriage, I think my marriage is um, is kinda over.
Umm, did you notice anything wierd about Ben today?
Oh-oh, guess what? I-I have a date with Elizabeth Hornswoggle.
That that's ridiculous! I don't feel guilty for her failures!
Dad seriously! Y'know you really should see someone about that!
Oh, please. Sweetie it's hopeless, okay, I'm just gonna go.
Hey, uhm, Phoebe didn't by any chance mention that.
Then how did you get caught in the barbed wire?
Well, she wore it all Christmas day, and then uh...
You had no right to tell me you ever had feelings for me.
You know, you are so amazing, is there anything you, you don't know?
Not that it's any of your business, but we did go out.
Okay, if you could all walk slower, that'd be great.
So do you have like any nuclear weapons on board?
Rach, Rach, we'll be fine, all right? You go have fun.
Yes! Wow, well, that-that was easy. Okay, you-you go.
You need me to go down there with you and hold your hand?
Okay. What ah, what is the matter with you? What's going on?
No no, no no, it's not flashy, not for a Goodfella.
He can hold a banana, if that's whatcha mean...
Wow! I didn't know that there was a Pottery Barn up here.
Everyone? I would like to make a toast to Rachel and Joey.
No. No, y'know you don't, you don't wear enough of this. What?
Hi! What... . Please tell me those are clip-ons.
No, hi, I'm, I'm an honorary Brown Bird
I'm really glad we came. You're so pretty. I love you.
Oh, yeah, no problems. It's all taken care of.
Eh, if it was meant to be, it's meant to be.
You what? Wh what were you doing seeing her boobies?
Come on up. I'm gonna get the rest of his stuff together.
Okay! Now, I'm going to touch you. Ohh, that's soft.
It's still a gift! I got it from the gift shop!
So suck it up man, it's a job, it's money.
Yeah... Oh, great. More party boys for Chandler!
'Kay, first of all, this attitude is not helping.
I'm fine. Just-just... having my worst fear realised...
Waitohheyhuh, oh great now he knows, and I don't know!
Oh I'll prove it! I'll prove it like a theorem!!
So you're strong enough to face her on your own?
Well Mr. Big Shot is better than 'wethead'.
Look, honey, I have tried to make nice, it doesn't work.
Chandler was totally flirting with the hot delivery girl!
Hi, Julie. Hi, Julie. Julie, um, how are you?
You got the clothes clean. Now that's the important part.
He could never get a woman like that in a million years.
A date?! She's-she's got a date?! With who?
Mhm, packing - sexy cheerleader comedy.
It isn't ridiculous, look around! No one's here!
Uh, nothing, nothing's with him. Enjoy your coffee.
All right-all right, fine! I-I'm gonna call the cops!
The kid...? Excuse me, uh, that's, that's my puck.
Well obviously only one of us can keep dating her.
Ah...ooh! Well, looks like, uh, we kicked your butts.
Ya wanna hang back and take our own cab?
Dude, you didn't say Die Hard. Is everything okay?
Hey, y'know what? Not all spring breaks are like that.
Hey, what are you doing shopping at eight in the morning?
Hey Chandler! Saw the new furniture. Very nice.
Wait a minute! Were you on a poster for gonorrhea?
Professor Sherman, yeah. I've a meeting with him today.
Basically, Rachel and I were in Vegas and we got drunk...
Really?! Wow! That's-that's so nice, what are you gonna get me?
It's not that easy, there's still a lot of relationship stuff.
Come on, Rachel, come on! Talk to me! Please!!
Okay, okay, we were on the ride along with Gary, right?
I have to say Tupolo Honey by Van Morrison.
No, but Chandler, hello... Aren't you scared of dogs?
Yeah. You can help me get my furniture back from Gunther.
....and 12, 22, 18, four... What?
I don't know! I guess I just can't believe any of this is happening.
Nono, that would be me again. I'm, uh, just trying something.
And that's what's gonna kill me. I'm allergic to kiwi.
Rach, thanks but uh, I don't need you doing me any favors.
Emily, there is nothing between Rachel and me. Okay? I love you.
Look at that, they won't even turn their heads.
Why not? It's built into the price of the room.
Why, why you do, like with the-the toe separators?
Well maybe, you know, maybe we should stay for one song.
Did you get Monica's authorization to move all of her stuff?
I got it! Hey, you get to sleep with her, I get the cramps.
One night, just-just sex. No strings attached?
"...and I'm a little bit rock 'n' roll"!
Thanks, Gunther. Hey! Umm, can I get a napkin too?
Oh, I wish I knew, but the evaluations are all anonymous.
Ok. I'll see ya later. Just think about it, ok.
It's worth the pain. Y'know what, you know what? It's not.
Yeah. And did you, did you pack that bathing suit?
No-no, I-I have to see if this apartment became available.
Seriously you guys, what's going on? What are these for?
Check this out. Five hundred and seventeen boxes!
Pheebs, you mind if I speak to Rachel alone for a sec?
And then she said it was the perfect way to say goodbye.
What is this dive? Only you could've picked this place.
Uh, hello, the buzzer buzzed. It doesn't count.
So, uh, what kinda stuff do you think they'll have you do there?
I'm sorry, Rachel, this is Charlie Wealer, she's a collegue.
Huh. Y'know what's not one of a kind? A twin!
Uhh, yes I did but there isn't. Okay, here we go.
Well, I suppose we just try to not look directly at it.
Well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title?
Well, there is an Arby's in the shape of a tee-pee.
Hey! Y'know that teacher who had a baby with her student?
Ok, cut! Great. That was... that was just... yeah!
You've got to help me my monkey swallowed a 'K'!
Ooh, your lips are so soft... Do that again...
Hey. Uh, Chan, can I uh, can I talk to you for a second?
Hey hey, we'll be fine. We're just gonna need a little time.
Yeah, you didn't expect her to live there with a baby did you?
No, I tried that. She says it has a weird smell.
Hey, is Chandler here? We talked about catching a movie.
Apparently she fell in the shower and hit her head.
Here you go, you can pay me back whenever you like.
I think he's been relaxing enough, thanks to you and Fireball.
This feels perfectly normal. Ok, get on the swing!
I know and yet here you are all ready for the next date.
I don't know. It's just not the same without Mom in the kitchen.
I can show you, I have it on videotape! It's an expression.
And as my wife I think you should grant me this favor.
Hey! What do you guys think about this. "Ross: The Divorce-Force".
Oh, I'm just over here with Ben. I thought we'd say hi.
Oh yeah, nobody knows. And we're not supposed to ask.
Oh, see I-I don't know if we're gonna be hungry at three.
That's okay, I'm not so crazy about myself right now either.
...a what? A what? What's the end of that sentence?
I won't date. I'll uh, I'll be here, with you, all the time.
So it's really a question of who could you have possibly done.
Oh yeah! Then how come you didn't get the Geller Cup?
I uh can't believe I'm gonna say this, but I think Susan's right.
Rachel! Well, you-you're not at home, you're-you're-you're right here.
Joey, it's worth finding out. I mean, if you really like her.
Seriously, I-I asked you before and you still haven't gotten it.
Will you hold Ben for a sec? Come here. Come here.
What a great idea! That will get Rachel to forgive me!
Oh no! It could be better, but it's gonna be okay, right?
Hey, hey, I'm your daddy. I'm the one without any breasts.
Oh please, can't I come to your special, magical cabin?
Absolutely! You'll love the feeling! There's nothing like it!
Tell me about it. So what, what's your magic number?
Order a pizza like, 'I forgive you?'
Hiiii-Ya!! I'm serious! You're not walking out on my sister!
Oh, here, I, I'll get it for ya. Whad'ya want?
Things you find in the ocean, You're gonna be on "Pyramid"!!
But not the husband, because evidently she can do this alone.
Chappy's heart rate has slowed way down.
That's right, I love you! And-and I'm gonna play with you all the time.
What. Oh no, you just rolled over the juice box.
Hi! What's ah, what's Mark doing answering your phone?
I talked to Rachel's sisters, neither of them can come.
No. When he called, I...I threw the message away.
All right! All right! It was the best nap ever!
Aw forget it, it's from Pier One. Sorry.
Hey, so uh, y'know how there's something I wanted to talk to you about?
Well yeah-yeah the Scottish history is so much more...
My friend Bethel rescued him from some lab.
No! No, come on let her sleep! She's so exhausted.
But wait, there's more. Hey, Chandler, what is in the envelope?
And in my defense, the cleaning lady came on to me!
Hey-hey, I thought she told you to follow the recipe exactly!
Haha! Got ya! Die, die, die!
I'm sorry. Dr. Green, Mona. Mona, Dr. Green.
What? What? What?!! Well they should put that on the box!!!
Damnit! I have this date tomorrow night and I have to look cool!
Hey, y'know what nickname never caught on? The Ross-A-Tron!
Okay. I think it's time to change somebody's nicotine patch.
Ahh, what's a little mid-life crisis between friends?
God, do you realize in ten years we're gonna be 40?
Well because I have to work on Monday, I have a big presentation.
Huh? I know, I know. Who am I? David Bowe?
What, do you, well umm, oh how about I come up there?
No no no, she gets a credit, hey, I'm in there too.
Hey, there's uh, some people outside, askin' about candy.
Will, high school was-was a long time ago.
No! No! It's wrong! It's-it's-it's naughty. It's taboo.
OK, see ya later, nice meeting you. You're welcome.
Whoa, hey! What are doing? Trying to get me drunk?
No, wait! Emily! No, wait, stop! Emily, please-
Oh hey, Gary, want me to grab the berry for ya?
Sure, go ahead. Whoops, sorry, sure, go ahead.
Um-hmm! Doesn't that sound delicious at the last minute?
Take thee, Emily. Like there'd be anybody else.
'Cause otherwise they'd have to call it the room room.
Is that what they say on the Figure Skating Team?
Yes!! I knew it!! Bye-bye! So long! Later!
Uh, yeah! I still can't believe she hates Pottery Barn!
You're weird today. Listen I uh, wanted to talk to you about something.
No-no, that's-that's not my thing! I do not love getting divorced!
That was so cool man, the way you leaned on that guy.
Yeah well, if ah, if that's the rule this weekend... No!
That's it? You're not mad? I mean, it must've been terrible.
3 minutes ago!!! I don't know why that's important ...
See there, you uhh, alright, ya, you did what I said.
Ok. B - O - S ...
Huh... huh... what a loser! Some more wine?
That's crap!! Sister Brown Bird. Good going.
Oh, I know. Y'know, just-just talking about it is getting me kinda...
The one with the cat. I gotta go, I've got another date.
Kinda like my uncle Ed, covered in Jell-o.
Why don't you come, I mean, I-I have two tickets, why not?
Hey, I don't know what to tell you guys that's the doll he chose.
I can't believe we're gonna be the only people that aren't in this wedding.
Monica, let's go. Come on now people, woman in labor.
Oh. Oh. Thank God, most women don't even feel them.
Come on. You gotta help me figure out what to do. Okay?
I have to go. Yeah, Carol should be home by now, soo...
Oh, you-you sure? Okay. Okay. So what's uh, what's your name.
Ok, what, what...ok, what did we think it was going to be?
Well, I thought so too, but then she said she'd marry you.
No! And I'm not gonna be, so you can save you little speech.
He is my girlfriend's father, okay? It's-it's, it's weird!
Fine. You'll-you'll watch it on video when we get back.
Well, where do I start? This is Julie. Julie, this is Rachel.
Ye... Yeah... Yeah... You got shellfish in your head.
What, woah, woah, $3500 at porcelain safari?
Ah? Well, he and I would probably have a lot to talk about.
Tough noogies, we're watching Predators of the Serengetti.
Pheebs you uh...you do know how to ride a bike don't you?
Okay. So well I'll umm, I'll have her home by midnight.
Well... you never know. How's, um.. how's the family?
No. I think you misunderstood what I was saying. What I meant was...
Still... this is amazing... Oh my god, thank you, Phoebe.
Hey, you know what I just realized? If you guys ever have kids...
It just amazes me that your still pulling stuff like this.
Oh...my...God! I-I see what this is! You are in love with Rachel!
And it's a wedding! It'd be weird if I'm not in it...
What do you want to do now? Huh? You wanna go get a drink?
Hey-hey, or I could bring my keyboard over here sometime!
Oh really. Is that how you felt when you turned thirty?
Let's, let's take this outside? Who talks like that?
Yeah, why would it be weird? Hey, Joey, can I get some coffee?
You won an adult Thanksgiving day spelling bee.
It's not that. Okay? Annulments are more complicated than I...
Peach pit. That night we, uh- we had-
That's, that's Julie. Ju... Julie, Julie. Hi Julie.
Uh actually, we-we've narrowed it down to two names.
So I guess you bought that book after we broke up huh?
You know that girl I told you about who lives up in Poughkeepsie?
I'm afraid the TV Guide comes to Chinandolor Bong.
Perfect. Perfect. So now everybody's getting kissed but me.
No, no, no, no. Tick, tick, tick, tick.
They're towing your car, they're towing your car!!
I know, I mean a PhD is just as good as an MD.
You-you're gonna get married?! I mean... We're gonna be brothers-in-law!
On behalf of everyone, I'd just like to say behuh.
Carol, honey, shhh, shhh, everythings gonna be alright.
Y'know, the kind of fun, you and Susan had when we were married.
Okay, are you mad at me because my hair gel smells?
What are you doing? Are you trying to hurt me? Or something?
Why wouldn't I want to come? I had fun at the first wedding.
Well, I-I was watching her the other day at the pizza place.
Y'know I remember when uh, when I was in college, we used to...
I can't believe you guys aren't going to be able to get married today.
Hey-Ooh! What's-what's that, dinner stuff? You making dinner?
Right, will you excuse us for one moment? What are you doing?
God, you're amazing... I didn't even have to ask you to call me that.
No! Nonono, wait a sec. I may have something in the back.
Wow. I'm sorry, when I was a kid I lost a bike to that.
Y'know, I-I-you've done a lot of stupid stuff too! Okay?
Look, don't blame us. You guys coulda been there, you know.
Ok, we gotta go, yeah? So, we'll see you guys tomorrow.
High collar and baggy pants say I'm a pro.
Oh my God, you've got a crush on your sister's stalker.
Well, we believe it originated here. In the Aroma Room.
Am I supposed to stand here and listen to this on my birthday?
Dad, before I was born, did you freak out at all?
Maybe he's just jumping on a pogo-stick and really likes it?
I can't ask people to do that? Would you ask people to do that?
Oh, all right. Tails! Can you-can you see what it is?
Rachel won't talk to me! She won't even open the door!
I'm serious. C'mon, you should go. Here. No, uh-uh, just go.
You were incredible! Brand new woman, ladies and gentlemen.
It is time for you to give your maid of honor speech.
Hello! I'm in the front seat, okay? I'm Gary's partner!
Hey, here's a theme: Come on in, live like bacon.
Ohh, I-I see lotion, I have lotion! Will that work?
Yes, her molecular epidemiology paper is due tomorrow.
Well ah, Aunt Silvia was, well not a nice person.
If it does? Then you're an amazing friend of mine.
I'm so we weren't in the car! Did he ever let up?
That's Daddy?! But doesn't it bother you? You're a waitress.
What can I do? One person wants to break-up, you break-up.
Well, at least she's with Pop-Pop and Aunt Phyllis now.
What? What-what, what are talking about? It-it worked with you.
: OK, I am calling your seventeen. What do you got?
Oh, don't worry about it! Just use your travel insurance.
Hi. Sorry Im late. Wheres, wheres Carol?
Thanks, I put a lot of extra thoughts on your gift.
I can't believe this! I shouldn't be the one making her throw up!
No, no, uh, it's not what you think. It's um the other thing.
Oh, thanks Gunther. STUPID BRITISH SNACK FOOD!!!!!!!
For what? For letting you throw me out of your office?
Would you excuse us for a second? Umm.... what are you doing?
It could be better! He, uhm... he fell asleep!
Joey where's the pipe that was holding the door open?
Uh, you know, you can't always get a seat on the subway, so...
'The hills were alive with the sound of music.'
What-what-what the-how da-how did-what the-how did-what?!
They don't like it when you keep asking them if they like you.
C'mon Rich, it's my birthday, let me live vicariously.
Not only did we go out, we did it 298 times!
Here. At least I made ten bucks in my relationship.
I know if you were getting married I'd feel, kinda..... y'know.
So do we!! So do we!! I'm sorry you had to see that.
Hey, remember how Chandler and Phoebe blew us off yesterday?
Who is intimidating to a guy who won the Nobel Prize?
She barely knows me. We just live in the same building.
This is a girl that I really like and had too swoop in there!
I'm gonna, I'm gonna go to London and I'm going to fight for her.
Y'know what? I think we've seen enough, let's turn it off.
And you're afraid you won't be able to...fill his shoes.
Look, if you'd had two failed marriages, you'd understand!
Well, I just spoke to Carol. Ben's got the chicken pox.
This was just a drunken mistake and I need to get it annulled.
What do you think you learnt how to do in the last two minutes??
I think I have an old band uniform from high school.
Y'know your probably not allowed to sleep with any of your students.
You, you know I, I don't, have a- have a problem with that.
All right, I'm coming out. Hey, can you turn the lights off.
Oh my God. Oh my God! And you're-you're...you're not freaking out?
You know, I, I used to, ah, play keyboards in college.
Ironically, most of the boxes seem to be labeled clothes.
Uh-hmm-Wait! It gets better. Um, yeah I was in Barcelona.
You know what? This calls for a bottle of Israels finest.
I'll tell you what Mon, I'll give you the first box for free.
No, it's ok! Made me feel like a rock star!
Look, I don't care it starts at eight, we can't be late.
Ironically, these are the guys who were picked last in gym.
I know. That's why I did it. Come on, are they really that bad?
It was totally flirting. "Somebody got a haircut "
Uh, how long until they announce the numbers, Mommy?
Monica categorizes her towels. How many categories are there?
Ok, um, uh, more clothes in the dryer? I'm fine, I'm fine.
Good. I'm just getting some coffee. So I'm alert for the wedding.
No, no, we will. We just won't tell her she messed up.
What the hell are you doing? You scared the crap outta me.
You know what, you can go, I just have to fill out some forms.
Oh, veto. How about-Ooh, I like Ruth! What about Ruth?
Well I-I-I don't care how hot it is it's-it's uh, it's wrong.
Well, I was going to, but after I talked to you, I talked to Joey.
Well, if you see him could you please tell him I'm looking for him?
Wow! Great! Wait, dad who-who's cigarettes are these?
I know I miss you too. I can't wait to see you. I love you. Bye.
Of course not. With you it's like I've got two 25-year-olds.
Oh-oh, hitting me where it hurts, my ski skills.
Not touching myself if that makes anyone less uncomfortable.
Hey, I just realized we kinda let some stuff up in the air...
I did give up a career in basketball to become a paleontologist!
Can't hold her own head up, but yeah jumped.
Monica, Monica, your guest are turning into jerky, OK.
Wait a minute! How-how the hell did you beat us here?
Hey! Oh listen, I was just clearing some space for your stuff.
Hey Pheebs, has Gary ever been shot at for real?
Well, Chandler's my oldest friend, but Joey's my-No! Ah!
That is precious! Listen! I need Rachel's flight information.
What?! When have I ever touched myself in front of you guys?
Believe me, if I did see with someone, there's no way I...
Not just Janice, Janice in labor, contracting and everything.
Uh-uh. See, I see.... big passion in your future.
Hi there. How many, how many ah, did you sell?
Nice. And by the way that uh, that line down my face?
Look, I am a reasonable man. I will accept store credit.
That's 'cause-'cause you're mom's dog kept-kept looking at me.
Am I?! And was it your idea to postpone the wedding?!
I wanna get out of the room! Y'know, I...I really miss downstairs.
Oh, well of course, the humiliating. So, so wee, we're okay.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What makes you think we're gonna break up?
Yes, yes I am. Are you a, uh, a friend of Rachel's?
I know, it's crazy! We were just pushing Ben on the swings...
Where the hell are Joey and Molly? I asked you to watch them.
Oh, thank you, thanks. So uh, how was your night last night?
No! No!! No! Can I speak to someone in charge please?!
Thank you. So did you ah, did you tell Mark Something about me?
My Thanksgiving leftover sandwich. I can't believe someone ate it!
I'm sorry, but we have to have some boundaries! My God, I'm dying.
Now, if you need to stay late, I want to be supportive of that.
Well, excuse her for knowing what she wants to do with her life!
Look, I don't feel like dancing, I feel like having a drink. Okay?
Wait a minute, she was walking the bike? Both times?
Hey, you'll never guess what just happened... Phoebe and I got mugged!
I got it. So hi, I'm uh, I'm Ross and this is my friend Chandler.
But that's not enough. So... So...here's a key to my apartment.
I'm having a baby in here! Ok, everyone stand back. Ow.
Fine! No more dinosaur stuff! Can I talk about fossils?
Exactly. So you didn't, didn't mention anything to Issac right?
Well, the doctor says he's gonna be fine, he's just sleeping now.
Okay, good stuff. Umm, well she's-she's sweet and pretty and...
Yeah, well missy, you better be glad that list is laminated.
Yeah, I'm gonna go to a doctor who went to school in a mini-mall.
There's this kid in my class who said he's in love with me.
And confused. Rach, sweetie, I-I um...I didn't propose to you.
I just wanna clarify this: are you outing Mr. Peanut?
And officiating at tonight's blackout, is Rabbi Tribbiani.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What, you don't, uh, you don't believe in evolution?
You were worried about me? You didn't know how I was going to react?
Yeah, if you're really hungry. It was a joke, I made a joke.
Absolutely. Just give me your breast and we'll be on our way.
Kiwi? Kiwi? I thought it was a key lime pie.
Yeah. I mean, it's been kinda quiet since Carol left, so...
You know what the best part about this is? I can never be fired.
Ok, bye. Well, Monica's not coming, it's just gonna be me and Rachel.
Are you angry at me because I said your handwriting is childlike?
Mark is that ah, the same Mark that helped you get the job?
I can't believe they gave you a ticket. You're such a good driver.
C'mon, you know everyone I've been with. All, both of them.
Oh, no! The MET! The Metropolitan Museum of Art.
What's uh, what's going on? Do you not, do you not like Katie?
Okay, that's it. WE ARE SEEING OTHER PEOPLE!
Uh, yeah, you sure you want to after what happened at their 20th?
Sure, one year is paper, but two months is lapdance!
Ok, I've heard myself on tape and I sound nothing like that.
Hey Gunther, can I get a couple of blueberry muffins to go?
No, no, no, no, no, no, not out of that, not out of clothes.
Ross has the blender! Ugh, everything's just falling apart!
Sorry. 'Cause umm, I think this will make you a little more sophisticated.
Hey, tell me again, what do I do when Mr. Roper calls?
Oh, 's'funny, really? Um, I don't remember you making any sperm.
Okay, flight 421 to Paris. I don't see it, do you see it?
Well, we didn't have freedom here until 1776, either so...
No, but, but I wanna be with you in spite of all those things.
And she's just so sexy and funny and has the cutest little...
So what's a matter, you need a dentist? I've got a good one.
Hmm, yeah. Come on Ross jr. It's time to go in.
Yay! And that takes what? Just six or seven minutes.
Your mother's right. Take her, you can wear my tux.
Okay. So, um, Phoebe tells me you, ah, you play piano.
Oh my God! Our daughter's a genius! Rach, this means...
Two? Wha...? Don't tell me you dated Benjamin Hobart.
Oh my-Come here! Come here! It's okay. Everything's gonna be okay.
Oh well. It probably would've been the most constructive solution.
Coffee sounds great. Wait, so, so you live in Montreal?
You bet. In the U.S., China, Africa, all over.
Hey guys, does anybody know a good date place in the neighborhood?
Okay! All right! Now, Chandler you-you wanna live with Monica, right?
Okay, I guess it's just flan for three! Hey, hey, that rhymed!
My dad wanted to know if you wanted to play racquetball with us.
Oh really? Well I-I guess Monica should know about Atlantic City.
Okay is there...some kind of magic tunnel to this hospital?!
Mom, y'know what? I-I can't deal with this right now. I'm sorry...
Years and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees...
Oh, yeah, well y'know Chandler printed it up on his computer.
You know, if it's meant to be, I'll guess it. Bye, bye.
What? I'm kidding. You know I'd never let him touch the Porsche.
Chandler was how old when he first touched a girl's breast?
Okay Phoebe, I guess you're next although I really don't see the point.
Okay, I'll see you soon buddy. Be back in an hour.
I'm sorry, I don't believe contestants are allowed to talk to each other.
Hi! I could help not notice, but that's an unusual necklace.
She sweat, wet. got it going like a turbo 'vette.
Look, we're just friends now! Okay? Why would I do anything stupid?
Okay. Umm, for a while now, I've been wanting to, um....
Come here, come here. Uh, ow! Emily, will you marry me?
Well, let's say, I don't know, you met someone in the pediatrician's office.
Joey, had an imaginary childhood friend. His name was?
Chandler. When did he... when did he... when did he?
Oh, I see, somebody is afraid of a little competition with the ladies?
Oh God, this is so nerve wracking! How-how do you do this?
Fine! Fine! Y'know what? Whatever you want. Okay? You're the mommy.
Yes, she is this new professor of my department that I did not kiss.
Joey! You're in charge, ok? You make sure nobody leaves!
No-no, one daddy, two mommies. All right, it's all yours.
Joey had an imaginary childhood friend. His name was?
Joey, you are gonna love this guy. Gandolf is like the party wizard!
We know you took so just-just save yourself the time and confess!
I don't, I don't understand. I mean, you, it's like we can't win with you guys.
Happy Valentine's Day! ...Or something to remember me by.
Ok well, I would like to do a dig in the painted desert.
It doesn't matter! It's my principles! We're talking about my principles!
Ah y'know, this building is on my paper route so I...
To be fair, he doesn't seem to be impersonating Fonzie...
Are you kidding? I have had some very dirty dreams about this...
Sure, because women never like Joey. Y'know, I think he's a virgin.
Just you keep it, listen did you, did you tell anyone about us?
True, but you're allowed to be unreasonable. You're having our baby.
That'll be a neat trick, when you're, when you're dead!
Why don't we just put 'poor little Tooty' out in the hall?
Yes, yes it is. In prison! Whatsa matter with you?
And you know I wanted to ask Charlie out since the day I met her.
All right, let's uh, let's bring it back down and-and try again.
Oh my God. But the zoo told me that my monkey was dead.
It's been sixteen years but the air quotes still hurt.
He said he liked that!! Oh you're right, you're right. I'm sorry.
Oh, it was good! It was good. Actually, the baby started kicking!
What? Oh yeah, yeah I think so. Why am I invited to this again?
Oh, I'm sorry. Please apologise to Sandy and the Snufflebumps for me.
Wait a minute; you don't think it was intentional? I mean, that's just stupid.
Yeah. He wouldn't give me the grant, because I wouldn't give you up.
Bye! Hey, I hope Emma isn't making it too hard on you.
Yeah, it's his, uh, innate Alan-ness that-that-that we adore.
You're fast and irresponsible. That adds up to a bad driver.
All right, you know that one was coming, but that doesn't mean you have unagi.
Open with a joke? It's a university, not a comedy club!
Okay, it's second down. Take all the second downs you need.
That's a good point. So uh, how long are you gonna punish him?
Hey! Hey! Come on! You can! I know you can do this! Let's go!
No. No-no uh, he just, he just really freaked me out before.
Yeah but after you said it was okay, I figured, "Why not?!"
Oh y'know what, girls don't like it when I start talking about science.
Listen, I'm- I'm sorry I was so hard on you before, it's just I...
That was in high school! It's not like it was binding forever.
Yeah, none of us have to deal with pressure at our jobs.
Okay, I'm gonna get your coat and then I'll-I'll put you in a cab.
Oh my god! I'm so sorry, Cheryl. I must have freaked out.
Hey look, Phoebe. I, uh, I laid out the states geographically...
Yeah. Hey, remember the time I jammed that pencil into your hand?
I know. He's like a new man. It's like a scene from Cocoon.
I've no idea, could be. Listen, I'm sorry I had to work tonight.
Well, you know, I'd feel a whole lot better if you got dressed now.
I wasn't farting! Uh, a little game from our table. Yes?
I guess...It still seems a little... moonlight boat ride!!
Yeah, little change in plans. Ahh, we're gonna break-up instead.
But is it technically a date if the other person doesn't show up?
No Phoebe, don't look! You don't want to see what's under there!!
We met at Phoebe's birthday party, I'm, I'm Ross Geller.
Well, you were right. How can they do this to us, huh? It's Thanksgiving.
I know! I know. You know what? I'm putting Ruth back on the table!
Hey Mike sorry to just drop by like this, can I come in?
There was just an explosion, okay? My hearing would be impaired.
Me neither, okay? We are - we're done being stupid.
Oh my God! You really want me to be the keynote speaker? Thank you!
That, that is funny... .... and Rachel keeps touching him.
You're sure? Nobody uh, handed out uh, mints or anything?
All right, it's cool you can stay here. My parents won't mind.
I told Emily to come. And I just need to y'know, talk to Rachel about it.
Oh I'm, I'm making this too hard. Okay, what do you want me to do.
Okay, well, if she always behaves like this, why don't you say something?
Okay, okay, see... that... that is the problem. He is too sensitive.
The game, Rachel, the game. You owe us money for the game.
Yeah, and she still wants to go! It's pretty clear where she is.
People ask me why we're not together, I just don't know what to tell them.
Well, I'm, uh, going to pick up Mona. What have you got going tonight?
No, I missed and hit the door. But, it opened really hard!
C'mon Monica, do it. Hey, you guys, um, Monica has some news.
That's right, you're gonna spend tomorrow at Aunt Rachel's, aren't you.
Yeah but, on the bright side, we get to be roommates again.
Uhh, okay, it's uh, Emily and I, we decided to uh, to get married.
'Cause I know what you're trying to pull here. Okay? It's not gonna work.
I'm meeting with professor Sherman about my being the keynote speaker...
What? No! Of course, of course I do! Are-are they gone?
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I got to get to the museum. So um, I'll see you tonight.
Oh my God! I'm sorry, I was talking to this nurse, completely forgot.
How come it's always us left in the field holding the ball?
There's no 'or' in mind. What is wrong with these pants?!!
So the first time you ask a guy out, he-he turns you down?
Oh, you know, I'm just gonna, I'm gonna hang out, work on my music.
You don't want to believe me, I'm Mr. Funny to you. Mr. Funny...
Yeah, he's a little sensitive right now, `cause he's so in love.
Well how much time before she absolutely has to start getting ready?
Oh my God, oh- is today the twentieth, October twentieth?
Hey. So I uh, I didn't get that apartment. Some problem with my application.
Yeah, sure, right! Like I've ever been in Rachel Green's room.
I don't know! Just-just talk to him-entertain him and keep him alive.
Okay, so on our no-date evening, three of you now have dates.
Nothing, ah there was this thing at the museum. Come on. Easy.
No but ahh! How much easier would it be if it were?
I promise you she's safe! No watch how much she loves this.
When you put a 'D' at the end of 'Fine' you're not fine.
Hop in. Get ready for the smoothest ride of your life.
God, I don't believe this. She could be giving birth in the cab.
Ah no. I don't, but it could not have been more than sixty.
You haven't by any chance chosen a groomsman yet, have you?
Huh. That's a really pretty name for-for an industrial solvent.
And for the record, it took two people to break up this relationship!!
I know, but ahhhhhh!! I really wanna go up there and finish that kiss!
Well, ya know, they're a little behind the times in Colonial Williamsburg.
Alright. There's a theory, put forth by Richard Leakey-
So, do we really have to ask who's going up on the platform next?
Shielding your face and shrieking like a girl... is not a backhand.
The guy who took Rachel to the prom? Why is he calling you?
Come on, who are we kidding? I'm doody. Please? She's watchin'.
Maybe I'll take her to that new French restaurant down the street...
Thanks? But I have plans; Elizabeth and I are going out of town.
"Hi Rach, are you there? It's me, pick up. Rachel. Rach!"
Did you get like a fresh batch of pregnancy hormones today?!
What was Monica's nickname when she was a field hockey goalie?
Thank you! And I have to say that first scene when you meet Mac...
Uh, actually mom, I think Monica thanked him for the both of us.
I don't know, I'm one sorry polentologist. All right Joey, we get it. I'm sorry.
Well actually, I'm picking Ben up tomorrow, maybe he'll be there.
Oh, hey, oh... I... I was-I was going for a hand shake.
So they said our table will be ready in just a few minutes.
Dude, it's just "Days of Our Lives"... there's no the.
Oh! Oh! She's upside down but she's coming! She's coming!
That's it. I'm in my apartment, you're not there, we're not having this conversation.
Hey, can I, can I get in on that? Because I'm kinda hungry myself.
Weird.. your psychic didn't mention anything about the scary pigeon...
Y'know of-officer I uh...I had the weirdest dream last night...
Look, Carol never threw me out of a room before you came along.
No, we-we're gonna be like best friends, that's why it's gonna be weird.
Oh, I uh, I mean, I... dude, I spent the whole conference with Charlie.
Alright, you know what? You're right. I should at least tell her how I feel.
Yeah. Yeah, actually um, I wanted to talk to you about that whole annulment thing?
Way to go guys. Y'know, you-you were really good at the stuff too.
So um...Thanksgiving. The holiday season is upon us, hm?
I don't know, you don't wanna mess with corn nuts. They're craaazy.
I don't know what I'm going to do. That date starts in like an hour.
Oh, so-so you talked to her. Did she, did she sound mad?
Uh, in her defense, she's right. I am stronger. I would destroy you.
Can I have everyone's attention please? I'm uh; I'm Ross Geller.
Well, OK, it's for a boy. Well, I know it's a little out there, but...Darwin.
No, I mean tonight, in the building. Suddenly. Into our lives.
Oh great. So all I need to do is get some new skin. Thank you.
And while that was good advice, you should know that what-what she wants...
Well uh, it's cause he had a thing with, wi-, with the thing.
I don't know, I mean you were a lot bigger, I mean, stronger back then.
No, you know, it's uhm... nothing you did, it's... it's uhm... my issue.
Question two. Why do we always have to have parties with committees?
Well umm, oh! I might be teaching another class this semester!
Well I am that. And that whole rage thing is definitely behind me.
Oh, oh that's right, I forgot about your ability to fuse metal.
Wha, OK, I'm sorry, let's uh, why don't we find someplace else.
Yes, yes, fine, that is my penis. Can we be grown-ups now?
Oh my god, it was you! I can't believe it, you... you mugged me?
Okay, this play, I want you to do a down and out to the right. Okay. Break!
Listen, I got to tell you I've-I've never been to a guru before, so...
Well it turns out that Ben and Sting's son do not get along.
Well, what is she goes down and-and sleeps with a bunch of guys?
Yeah the dad and Ben eat soup and pretend to enjoy it.
Just then or-or all the time, 'cause we-we have jobs y'know.
Oh... Ohh... I'd love to but I really have to grade these papers.
It's a big deal to me. This is great, Monica. I really appreciate this.
Y'know I don't understand why they didn't cry. It was a beautiful speech.
Woah. Huh. You know about my, I mean, you know I had... you know?
Probably. But you know, I'll tell you something. Passion is way overrated.
Oh wait-hold it! But then I started thinking and I stopped the kissing.
Sure. Once, at work I-I thought carbon dating was fossilized...
Sure! Hey, I just found out, I get Ben for the holidays this year.
Okay, stop it! I can't deal with this right now. I have to go have a baby.
Because what's going on with Rachel has nothing to do with how I feel about you.
I can't believe it. Can I tell you something? I'm a little mad at him now.
Did you hear that? Kori Weston had a crush on me!!
Not for tonight. Not for tonight! Wh-what, what, what, are you doing?
Well I'm, I'm a little slow. Just as our children would be.
Alright, alright, now-now who should I say tricked me into doing it?
That's okay, I'm cool over here. I'll catch up with you later, Joey.
Hey! Hey! If he's moving, maybe I should try to get his place!
Wow. Umm... Huh... I'm-I'm not sure what to do with that right now.
Yeah. Yeah. Yes, this place is beautiful. Emily's parents got married here.
Hey! Hey! Hey! I get to choose my best man, and I want both you guys.
Beef in a dessert?! I- no no no, there is no way!
Actually I'm a palian... Dinosaurs is fine... the drawing is not.
Well this, this is too much, I feel like I should get you another sweater.
No, no. She's way to emotional. And by emotional I mean crazy.
Yeah, we kissed, but... nothing else... nothing else happened, okay.
Wow, did not know that! May I say how lovely you look today?
Wait a minute, there's two sets of nozzles, which one is it?
No, I mean it. You are so loyal man, and selfless, and generous...
And you made it through that? I wonder who's gonna play you in the movie!
Sometimes, you should come over sometime! I'll play you one of my other...
According to Chandler, what phenomenon scares the bejeezus out of him?
Like uh y'know like this! This! She-she could've made this!
Oh yeah, yeah we're moving forward. You'll be getting our card!
Why...Why should I? I mean if she wants to move on, that's fine!
Wha-I'm having, I'm having a boy! Huh, am I having a boy?
Does that mean the same thing in England as it does in America?
Yes! That's where we realized we were both super cool people!
For your information, it's a card sharp, not a card shark.
Chandler?! You brought Chandler?! The next best thing would be Monica!
No! No! No! The "Come here to me" is y'know for the ladies.
Your page said come to the hospital, what? What was it? What happened?
Uh, aside from that, the whole evening was pretty much a bust.
No-no, I'm...I'm sure no one was looking. Just want some privacy.
Why, does it look like I'm having trouble with my misshapen claw?
Great! Great. Then I must've left it at Mona's. I knew it!
Thanks to a little something called "Helvetica Bold 24 point"!
Know what-If somebody doesn't tell me what's going on right now...
Look, I'm not being any of those things, ok, I'm just being realistic.
So! Poetry? Susan's gay! They're being gay together!
Oh my God, he just said your name, that's great! Good job Ben.
Okay, okay, awkward question. The hospital knows you took two, right?
I grew up with Monica! If you didn't eat fast you didn't eat!!
Okay. Okay. If uh, if you're gonna do this, then I'm gonna do that. So...
So Rachel called. Wants to see me. Going over in a minute.
Oh, I believe I had the half-drunk cappuccino with the lipstick on the rim.
Wow, this is really soft . Three hundred and fifty dollars?
Monica! Stop throwing it so hard! We're on the same team!
Oh, you have to call the police! That's what I did to the kids in my building!
No! And somehow, we ended up with a joint checking account.
Oh, and she's pregnant with my baby. I always forget that part. Helloo!
Okay. I did divert her and we ended up having a great time! Okay?
Check it out! Almost 3 hours without droppin' it!
Well now let's-let's look at this objectively, I think I should date her...
Hate him? I... No, I don't hate him. It's just it's Rachel, y'know?
I think we do. Why don't we go inside? Look uh, I know why you're here.
I hate America! When I finish this game, I swear I am moving.
Mike "Gandolf" Ganderson, only like the funest guy in the world.
Okay. Wow! This is going so well. Did you see us? Did you see?
You're taking the word of a guy who has night vision goggles?
Actually this looks like pretty good! Yeah! Boys will be boys?
Well, I guess I'm in the wedding then. Ha haaa... He stinks!
I had a dream last night where I was playing football with my kid.
Oh, no, it's great. It's great. He is... He is an amazing guy.
Yeah, I'm gonna stay and read my book. I just wanna be alone right now.
Here's an idea. You walk into a room...take a quick scan!
You know what, I think we've had all the bad luck we're going to have.
You can't just call Godfather. Don't you think her brother should be Godfather?
What do you mean, they're not moving in? They-they're still moving in right?
Um uh...We're-we're just having this baby together but uh, uh that's all.
Well, if I'm still here in an hour, buy him a drink on me.
Oh! You are gonna love it! and I'm so glad, we're finally doing this.
You're welcome, Ben. Merry Christmas, ooh, and Happy Hanukkah!
To talk to Rachel, isn't that why we took a ride in the death-cab?
Wait a minute, I know why I'm being such an ass, why are you?
Okay, but just the jacket. Double-oh and seven are not gettin' in there.
No that's not what I want. Uh, I'm glad you guys were bonding but I...
I don't know you'd be so bored with marriage. I mean it's so... normal.
Are you saying your kid eats soup better than my kid?
What can I do, she doesn't listen to me about renter's insurance either.
Flip me for it? No, no, no... heads, heads, heads!
I don't feel like having sex. Maybe we can watch a movie or something.
Come on you guys, we're sorry, alri...? Our subway broke down.
Well, you better hop outta the shower, cause... I gotta flush.
Oh. Oh! Oh my God! Okay, I know this, give me-give me a second!
Move it! Move it! Move it!! Hey!!! I'm the teacher!!
OK.... um, a weird thing happened to me on the train this morning...
Whoa-whoa-whoa, hey! Now remember what we talked about, you gotta be strong.
So you guys having any luck getting rid of the entertainment center?
Are you sure? Great. Carol? Wanna come over and join us?
You don't think it's a little crazy that you get all my points just 'cause you...
Look both, Joey and Monica feel the same way that I do. No-no-no-no.
Hey, I seem to remember someone bringing his security blanket to college!
Uhm, well... I'm here to see if you'll give Rachel her job back.
What? What? What?! You guys knew? You all knew and you didn't tell me?!!
You know what, he's a big boy, I'm sure he'll find us, ok?
I'm sorry you lost your money, but I won it fair and square.
Don't yell at me okay, this is the most I've seen you all week.
Hungry monkey! Haaa! I'd like a Wicked Wango card!
I have no idea. I mean... But-but I assure you I will figure it out.
No, it's my joke, it's mine. You can call them, they'll tell you.
OH MY GOD!! I didn't really believe it until you just said it!!
Oh. Wow! Huh. Boy! Well, someone's been doing their homework.
As in, "I now pronounce you wife and wife" married?
You can't go, I mean you're the glue that holds this group together!
Phoebe, 800 is toll free, 801 is-is Utah.
You know, Barracuda was the first song I learned to play on the keyboard.
I've never walked down the aisle knowing it can't end in divorce.
Yeah, it's no big deal. I mean, I just met her and I'm fine with it...
Pheebs, we had the most incredible night! Okay, so, we're in the car...
Well, he said there's definitely nothing to worry about, it's totally benign.
Thank you, but I want to remove it Pheebs. I don't want to make it savory.
Uh, if you guys don't mind, I'd like to take a moment, just me and him.
Well that's different! Okay? Because he, he was actually in love with me!
No, you guys, I mean my keyboards are all the way up in-No, yeah, okay.
Look at you two, bonding, making us late for the airport so...
We are never gonna find him! He's one guy in a huge city!
Oh, hi! Hi! Thanks for showing you up thirty minutes late!
Please, please stay with me. I am so in love with you. Please, don't go.
Let me hold him for a sec. There. Huh? There we are.
Right. So is it gonna be like 'I'm abandoning you while your upset.'

I bet someone could use one of Monica's freshly baked cookies.
No, look, hey, it's my birthday, and the important thing is that we all be together.
I uh, went to a bar. And then I just uh, just walked around for a while.
Ok, ok, here is to my sister, the newly-appointed head lunch chef--
Oh come on! Here we go! Stand by for mission countdown!
Oh, Pheebs, I'm sorry, Ive got to go. Ive got Lamaze class.
Yeah, the phone was facing the other way. And that goes back up there.

I'm sorry, it's almost as if this wasn't built for a quick getaway!
All right, show's over. Nothing to see here. Ok, let's do laundry.
To London! Come to London. Please? It'll mean so much to me.
She brought them up! I didn't realize you were coming back so soon!

No, it's really not that bad. I mean, I-I for one, feel perfectly safe.

Oh, I'm no actor, I'm a professor of palaeontology. Joey: It's a science.
What do you think you're gonna do, have sex with her right here on my couch?
Oh, nothin' much. Just trying to figure out what I'm gonna do for dinner.
Although if we're gonna do that, we should probably call me "Daddy" too.
Do you realise we almost made it ten years without that coming up?
We were drunk! I would've married uh, Joey with that amount of alcohol!
No! Okay! Okay! Okay, look, can I, can I just-just talk to you for a second?
You're right. Yours is worse. You are the king of bad Thanksgivings.

Okay, umm. Did you ever see, um, Return Of The Jedi?
No see now, now I can't because uh, I'm feeling too self conscious.
All righty roo. What a great moment to say that for the first time.
How do you know? I mean we thought Carol was straight before I married her!
