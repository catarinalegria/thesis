You said no right?!
Emma was doing it!
May I help you?
Monica's a little drunk.
Hi, how are ya?

This is not a sign!
Fine, let's do it.
It's a buffet man.
The hot chicks?

What's the matter Joe?
Oh, the mixed tape.
I can't believe you did this.
What are you doing tonight?
Hey! How was lunch?
I don't think that's exactly...
What a sweet story.
Not fun anymore?
No, there were two.
Oh, good job Joe.
Hey! How'd it go?
Yeah, I'll go get one.
That's me! Come on!
We don't, really.
I'm begging you stop.

Okay, I'm not gonna have one.
Oopsey, missed it!
Yeah, like in a cab...
First of the month.
Okay, hold on. Okay.
Oh my God! Play!
How do you figure that?
Ross, ten o'clock.
You mind if I...
I thought it was $98.50.
In the game room!
No, I'm alright, thanks.

So I got ya something.
Honestly? Me too.
I just wan't to...
No!! You can't!!
A face ass?
Dude, you're shaking!
You don't like that show?
All right I'll have one.
Y'know what, pretty good.
Bored and bored!
Humiliating and noble!
That's the perfect amount!
So, what are you gonna do?
What, like a number?
Why is that so funny?
Why can't you tell her?
Yeah so, Tuesday?
Could I be more sorry.
Oh yes! Oh yes!
Oh, this is not that bad.
Why?! What happened?!
Well it's very unsettling.
Wow! You look amazing!
That's a low one!
Yep, pretty much.
I've got good news!
Picturing that tree?
Yeah-yeah, me neither.
That's... That's was...
That would be advice!!
He will, Joe.
Okay. I'll be right there.
Well, we are great guys.
No, Amish boy.
It still doesn't work.
Well, aren't you a treat.
Stop it. Stop it!
That sounds like fun.
So, this isn't over?
What does it say?!
I'll ask. Boohaki?
'S'why I'm dancing...
Fear of Triscuts?
Welcome home man.
Couldn't be more out.
Hello, Chandler Bing.
We can talk about that.
We can't accept this.
Hey, he's not crying.
What else is new?
Yeah! You wanna come?
He has a gun!
Okay, that's enough honey!
Stop making candy!
Oh fresh air!
Really? You're gonna be okay?
H-He's in China!
Do you want a calculator?
Honey, it's gonna be okay.
Oh, DAMN IT!
Oh, my, god!
See? Here we go.
Well, what did she say?
I'm free! I'm free!
You okay there man?
That's-that's my nubbin.
No thanks, Josephine.
No thanks, Mom!
You do? That's fantastic!
I'll tell you at the wedding.
You know, you think I would.
That's what I was doing too.
Ross, it's just a sandwich!
I spelled out boobies.
Good morning, everybody.
Okay, good-bye. Good-bye.
I don't think you can do that!
I can't believe she's married.
No you know I don't mind.
Hey Phoebe! Fatty!
Totally worth it!
Hey-hey, is Monica here?
Have you seen Joey?
That was... Impressive.
Congratulations!/Good for you!/Great!
I'm not supposed to tell you.
Well, this is much better.
There's a Mr. Bing!
Nice work my friend.
I think I should get the chair!
I mean, I was sitting there.
Aww, I love you so...
So, where's Mike?
You need new clothes.
Oh yeah? Well thanks.
Is that a real thing?
I wanna quit the gym.
Ah. Chandler Bing.
Stick to your side!
Haha, no thanks!
You still want that baby?
Oh, it's okay. I don't...
We didn't play it!!
Yeah, I'm not so worried.
In a bad way?
You didn't just break up.
I'm not Jewish, so...
But, those are for you.
Alright, here's ten.
...The second guy.
Oh, what's at 8:00?
Thank you! Thank you!
Oh, I don't know, a million?
So you don't have the cameras?!
Um, is it sugarless?
On every word?
It happened in London.
Yes. Right where?
Well this one's for you.
I'm here to see Mary-Angela.
What about the time difference?
Okay, I gotta go to work.
We're moving to Tulsa!
Right. So, I'm sorry...
What gave me away?
This is not going to work.
She's not gonna say no.
Okay, then get the lobster!
Well this is just sad!
And you're okay with that?
Really? I don't like baths.
Hi Joey's sisters!
How far outside?
You gotta do it, man.
Are you really that busy?
It's a sock bunny.
Sex on the balcony?
Courtside? Oh my God.
You really want to take me?
And twenty-five it is.
Yeah, I'm cool. Casual.
Your cappucino sir.
I'll...I'll get you later!
Mine was a humdinger.
Is it really that bad?
Well, thank you for lunch.
Hi! How'd it go?
Hey-hey are you drunk?
See, honey, there's-
Oh, seriously you want him?
Another hard 8.
So it did go well.
Well, I'm going to kill you.
Wait, we can't do this.
Why would I be mad?
Oh, what the hell is that?
Hey, what was that all about?
Yeah, didn't he tell ya?
Here's another plan...No!
We're taking a break!
Coffee in a fight!
And to you too, Helen.
Okay, so Richard, Richard!
I made that joke up.
Hey, this is so unfair!
He saw a therapist?
Well yeah, but then...
All right. Very good.
Yeah, check out the ring.
Uhh, no-no thanks.
Oh, I think I have the cash.
Oh yeah man. Joey.
What am I gonna do now?
Why did I get married?!
We have heard you play.
And your friend Phoebe?
Can we start over?
You mean like, music?
Look, are you gonna be ok?
Why did you get me this?
Hi, Paul, is it?
What equity investments?
This vacation sucks!!
Y'know, whipped! Wah-pah!
Where you going, Joe?
Phoebe knows about us!
Yeah, let's just forget it.
Okay, Ross is in the bathroom.
Did you know this about him?
And a date with a man!
Oh-oh, what are you doing?
I'm not arguing with that.
Lose the other guys.
Did I not mention that?
Yes, but for the last time.
Rachel, wait, wait.
Joey, no means no!
So what does this mean?
Yeah, he came up...
Forget it, that's off.
So, you busy Thursday?
Yeah, Ross is here so...
Because that would be crazy?
Happy New Year!
Hey! How's the boat?!
I'm the ruptured spleen.
Oh, do you not want to?
That is a bad interview.
What is the matter with you?
Not it! Damn it!
Who are those people?
Hi, oh hi.
So, what're you gonna do?
Oh, I couldn't be happier.
I also said, "Yes!"
Today is the sixth.
Joey's a sex addict.
That's patio furniture!
All right, let me in.
Totally crazy stupid.
Come on guys, PUSH!
To see her pants?
I can't believe you came back.
Hello! Little ones.
Do you know what just happened?
I know, what are we gonna do?
Because it's too delicious.
Ohh, that's a good one.
I can check that for ya.
Ahh, third base.
Your sister Ursula.
What's the matter honey?
Unfortunately that is correct.
No reason, except...she...told...me.
He really is a chameleon.
Nope, not under here!
See you later Mon.
I'm going to the bathroom now.
Seriously, answer faster!
You are really frightening me.
Do you want me to call?
That's what I did. Wah-pah!
PUSH! PUSH! PUSH!
What's up with the simian?
Oh, great. This is just...
Of course it was!
Did she look 16?
Ah that's a cantelope.
When'd you meet her?
Ooh, you almost had it.
The comedian? USO?!
You're welcome, sweetheart.
Wait, you guys, look!
I'm sorry, I won't be here.
Are you, are you high?
Uhh. You are welcome.
OK, let's do it. What?
Me? No. You?
She? It's a girl?
Oh yeah, that looks good.
An old cookie?
Does anybody know me?!
Okay, one thing at a time.
So are we...friends again?
Ooh! That's my girl!
How do you feel about that?
Okay, so he's out of here.
'Cause I was sitting there.
I'll cancel the sodas.
What is wrong with Emma?
Yeah, all right, I'll play.
We already knew that!
Staying out of the way.
Well, I feel like a snack!
It's me. I'm the other guy.
I can't believe I ruined this.
Let's have Monica decide.
Let me try it on!
I haven't seen this dress.
What are you doing out there?
Bullies, big bullies.
They'll never understand!
A vending machine?
Hey! What are you guys doing?
Actually, I don't like martinis.
Really? Male nurses?
And last but not least.
Wait, wait, wait.
Yes, it's also 2003.
Work on your music?
Your tax dollars?
I don't... uh... understand.
We could trade later.
Oh uh, o, OK.
God that is good TV.
It's an old key!
Oh, okay, time's up!
We're very happy for you.
Hey. Where've you been?
Is it made of cheese?
So, uh, how was he?
Okay, what do you guys think?
I think it just fell off.
Hi honey I'm home.
Oh, you'll see my friend.
Oh no-no-no, that's not-No-no-no!
All right, rock on.
Hey, you feelin' better?

Batman has the Batmobile!
Okay, good luck with that.
It's throwing and catching!
So, are we going in there?
Hey Pheebs, what's up?

Was that another question?
Lick away my man.
So what was it for anyway?
We are on our honeymoon.
Whoa! Don't know about that.
He's the boss's son.
My lighter's in there!
Well.... it is amouz-ing...
No, I let him win-Ross!
I can't believe we're doing this.
It's the Miracle Wax.
My duties? All right.
They put you in jail?
I think you should take the job.
Hi, honey! I'm home!
Uh-oh, it's my boss!
No, no, no. No-no-no.
You wanna hug it out?
Oh, I'm going on the lamb.

So, I guess this is over.
Yeah, well, lucky for you.

You mean a three pointer?
Because, I'm too afraid.
Football? Just football?
Oh no! No! No! No!
There's nobody here Joe.
So, you don't think I'm terminal?
He's Greek Orthodox.
I can't believe we live here!
It's not charity, Joe...
But we don't know the neighbors.
Alright. Yes, this is Rachel.
Isn't she cute? No!
Seriously, we're gonna do this?
Do I still call you Ross?
You slept with the stripper?
Why? What happened to him?
Excellent hole, Joe.
What?! Why did you do that?
Oh, this is soo bad.
I - I don't think I can.
Could you want her more?
Yeah, we got, um-hmm.
Well maybe he was nervous.
You just thought of that in there?
Okay, come here! Come here.
It's okay, I got a plan.
I can't remember which sister.
OK, Pheebs, your turn.
Hmmm, that's very cool.
I said art lover.
Well, either that or uh...
Oh, are we playing this?!
That's not a state Joe.
I know, this is a great apartment.
What are you guys talking about?
No, really you're gonna freeze.
Okay, on three. One....Two....
I'll give up my ticket.
Marriage advice? Really?!
I got a maid. Yay!
It's Clint. It's Clint!
He's at a dinner party.
Actually it's both of us.
So that's the girl you like.
Oh, y'know, y'know what Pheebs?
Oh-ho-ho, I don't think so!
Isn't that Ross's money?
Let's do it, come on!
Hi honey I'm home!
I got you something from Vermont!
Your thoughts? Plural?
Ben! Ben! Ben!
Water! Water! Water!
Oh, she's goin' somewhere.
Oh yeah! With who?
At a fake game!!
No, no, no, no, no!
What, what's what you mean?
Hello, Joanna......'s office.
I'll take her back tomorrow.
What is so funny about that?
Happy birthday! I'm sorry.
You guys wanna eat here?
You don't even have a car!
Hey! Happy birthday ...
Happy birthday, pal!
Monica. Calm, self.
Uh, if you say so sir.
Oh yeah, I totally agree.
I know what she's talking about.
A little late for that.
Now, there's two reasons.
You, you are gonna love this.
No, no, you don't have to see.
Y'know, I don't see that happening?
Not if I kiss you first.
Should we call the spitter?
Oh, will you give me the thing.
Yeah, for about 30 minutes.
That's a good call. Right.
Boys? We're going in.
New York is awesome!
Hey, what you guys talking about?
Yeah, let's celebrate life!
Well, I have a call in about that.
Well, we could count again.
Y'know, you'd think I would've.
Oh no-no, I can't do that.
Isn't Ben in this?
Well the duck can swim.
I don't care! I don't care!!
She has a real name.
Hey, Rach, can I get...
Sounds like a date to me.
Tell it again. Seriously.
Somebody is gonna pick us.
Is that your new walk?
And that doesn't scare you?
What did I marry into?
Joey you broke my chair!!
Her name is Erica.
This took you all day?!
Phoebe is, making people.
The man's got a point.
OK, Phoebs, your turn.
Oh, what a crappy night!
I am, I'm ignoring you.
Oh, oh, c'mon in.
Yeah, we really missed you guys.
Ok, this could be tough.
Okay, who wore those?
I-kea! This is comfortable.
I'll catch you guys later.
I wouldn't know, I didn't make it!
So-You got in voluntarily?!
We've got to do something!
So, a professor, uh?
And that's how you bought it?
I'm not gonna mess it up.
But you're still my friend?
Hey, y'know what? I was wrong.
Yeah, yeah right over there.
Yeah, I'll take care of it.
How about Joey... Pepponi?
Althea?! What are you doing?!
This is going in your book?
Merry Christmas, you guys!
Oh! It's on! It's on!
Man, I am so beat.
How's your room Rach?
Phoebs, play with meeee.
Ring dammit, ring!
Ok, ok, here we go.

You're shooting with Althea?!
The reason he just said.
I believe I read that somewhere!
I know, it's beautiful. Amazing.
Hey! Hey, hey-hey, hey.
Oh o-, OK man.
So who's gonna tell them?
Hey guys, what are you doing?
...And what did you bring?
I don't have travel insurance.
But I think we should tell her.
Your boyfriend is so cool.
Take off your shirt!
Ah! Ahh!! Ahh!!
I said it first, bro.
I can't believe it! We're here!
Ok, you can not do this to me.
How do you know that? How?
Hey Joe what's up?
Yeah, I know that means buddy!
Don't play with his things.
Ok, how about this ?
Takin' that with you, huh?
I never stopped loving you.
Oh, how well you know me...
Oh, you must stop shooping.
Yes, money well spent!
That's what they'll call us.
That, that's what's stupid.
What?! What are you talking about?
What stupid thing did you do?
Yes! Ross, you have to stay!
And, a lemon lime.
This game is kinda fun.
Yes have you seen any?
What about that circled one?
I mean, you have a lovely home.
Can you people not see me?!
No, not us... Us!
You can't move at all?
Can I finish my story?!
He thought you said gonad.
I'm not getting into this again!
That was there when I got here.
I paid for those tickets!
Those are all really old!
Fine! Maybe I will too!
Oh, right, right, shut up.
I'm sorry, did you say cheese?
I want you to say that you like her!
Hi! Nice to meet you!
Because I'm gonna play for ya.
You're right, this is more fun.
Did she go out with him?
Okay, bye! Oh my God!!
Sounds like a fun party.
I said, "Like what?"
Don't worry about it Pheebs.
No not Candy Lady.
Is there a puppy here?
Oh, good. Rog is here.
You're naked in this picture!
Yes, this, this was pleasant.
It's like a giant hug.
She's just doing her job!
Well, how you died was funny.
There we go little fella.
Dude that is so sad.
What if Joey were president?
Why haven't you told them?!
What are you guys doing together?
It was a car backfire!
Well that's a full cup!
You don't know. You didn't see it.
So, is Janine around?
Oh that's not bad, Pheebs?
Is anybody else scared?
By drowning or...?!
Oh, uh, listen, about tonight...
Okay. I wanna quit the gym.
I married Fred Sanford!
Oh they didn't want to come!
You can't make this stuff up!
Pheebs! Always a pleasure.
Man, I gotta get a kid.
No don't I beg of you!
It's exactly like it sounds.
That's perfect! That's brilliant!
OH MY GOD!!!
Pie eating contest?
Do you know what I was thinkin'?
Okay, we owe you a present.
