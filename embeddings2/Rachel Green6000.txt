Good, you guys are all here!
He carries a briefcase.
What?! You say that to kids?!!
Phoebe! You can't do th...
Oh, no no no no no.
Who are you supposed to be?
Aah... I bet you're right.
Yeah Phoebe, I completely understand.
I think he's across the hall.
What college was that Dina?
Just washing the windshield.
Because! Because I was sad.
Oh what do you know? Virgin!
My God! What happened to you?
Say hi to Wally.
Thank you. Thank you. I love you.
Go on! Go on.
What do you, what do you mean?
...I mean it's my fault.
Oh, howd she take it?
OK, OK, it's my turn.
Aw, honey, that's so sweet.
Well, it was all Ross's idea.
Wow that was a big one.
What? Yeti-I mean Danny?
Thank you. So are we good?
What?! You got us evicted!!
Uh, to Stephanie Schiffer.
Oh, I think I saw some in here.
Oh, look, wish me luck!
Ross! Stop it! Come on!
Amazingly, that makes sense.
"Oh, my, god."
Hey! Hey what's going on?
I didn't know there were docks.
Excuse me. It's about the job.
Oh... Oh boy... Hi...
I don't want you to see me naked!
Well... Umm, I got TiVo.
No, you wait! This is ridiculous!
Yeah. A year ago..
Ok, so let's talk money.
I don't know where the phone is.
Oh wow, this feels weird.
Honey that sounds like fun.
Wow! I did not see that coming.
Joey asked me marry him.
Wow, you guys, this is big.
Is he romantic with her?
That-that you came on to me?
Oh yeah? Since when?
Hi, this is my friend Rachel.
It's a uh, regatta gala.
Ohh, and the nicest girlfriend!
Does anybody need anything?
Oh! What's new in sex?
Oh. Right. ...Oh great.
No Joe, no miracle.
Probably just the first half.
Oh honey, but it is just about...
No! I'm so happy for them!
Ross, why didn't you tell me that?
Awww, just like his daddy.
Yeah, Phoebe you're... awful!
Nothing. I don't want to do anything.
Why?! What?! Are you kidding?!
Ross, you're like my best friend.
What?! She made the tea!
Oh! I knew it! What happened?
Then what? What do you want?
We won. We won!
Ohhhh, sorry I missed that.
Have you been working out?
Well no, I don't smell anything.
4 o'clock. Food?
Huh ha ha!
Her dancer friends?
Three of your five, what?
Oh! Molly! You're not Ross.
I'm fantastic. You remember Ross?
Did you just break the radiator?
All right Ross!! I get it!!
Wha. . . hey!
Well, h-how is this like that?
Joey! Come here! Come here!
Well try to keep it down.
Thank you...we're so excited!
Oh my God! That is so good!
Ugh. Wait, wait, wait.
Say more things like that.
Yeah, that's probably a good idea.
Oh, he's just goofing around.
Well, then can we meet him?
Hello? Oh, Pheebs! It's Phoebe!
Ooooh! Wow!! Oh, hi.
You are soo enjoying this.
Chandler, you have an assistant right?
Okay, should we get some coffee?
Oh stupid metric system!
Oh. Oh my God, is that Phoebe?
We're paying for this y'know.
I'm just going to grab the phone.
Not uh, not to my recollection.
Let me see that. Oh, yeah.
What are you, what are you doin'?
Monica's gonna marry a millionaire!!!
Ooh, your brother. Score!
Okay, I'm done. Do mine.
Do I have my own castle?
You want me to see a therapist?
He's not having an affair!
Hey he's wearing a sweater.
Yeah, I'm not talking about her...
Well, I would like to have the option!!
"Yeah." "Me neither."
"Yeah." "Me too."
She-she died Jill.
Fine! We'll ask Phoebe.
Well then I can't tell you what I know.
Hey, I thought that guy was married.
Yeah, these are pretty ch-ching.
All right. Hey-hey-hey!! Sandwiches!
I couldn't be inner. Monica?
Where the hell've you been?
Well, y'know, sometimes that helps.
She asked-asked you out again?
Huh.. How about 600?
So what are you guys going to do?
Oh please, they're having sex.
God I'm just a horrible person.
Wel-wel-well what are we gonna do?
Well, I-I'm startin' too.
We'll be right back sir.
Because he's stealing from me!
I know, I still need to talk to you.
Do you wanna play football?
Okay, don't listen to him. Please?
Oh so-so not really never.
Hey, c'mon, cut it out.
All right!! Fine! Fine.
She you in the parking lot.
Ohhhh, I cannot look at it!
I'm-I'm sorry, I just thought that...
What thing? What is this thing?
Come on! I think this is funny!
It's open! Hi, Joe!
I'm sorry. I'm done. I'm done.
Ohh, I'm gonna be on the news!
Ohh-Do you think he will?!
Did-did you take these back?
Wow! This place is fabulous!
Oh yeah. That's a great story.
So, uh, how was your day?
So you know how to fix it?
How do you know about that story?!
Okay fine, what do you have?
Emma! See? I don't want it.
You put these on my desk!
Hey! Hi, how's my girl?
I KNOW!! I KNOW!! I KNOW!
We have to get her a present?!
Oh my god. Janice, hi!
Aww, look at the little thing.
Yeah, 15 hundred dollars.
Oh and I'll call ya too!
So now what have we agreed?
Because I knew you were lying!
Um, Mon, Chandler's not here.
God, Monica it's on the ceiling.
And um, what-what is that Ross?
Well, you were pretty damn good.
Yeah, that was a real good one.
Oh-oh! Okay, she's kicking!
Really?! Oh my God! I'm successful!
Hey Joey, what 'cha doing?
You remember when we got these?
Okay, I'll see you after the thing.
What song was that, Pheebs?
Well yeah, sure, what's up?
Oh, sorry, it's my phone. Hello?
OK, then get me your purse.
You give me back my Walkman!
I, uh, think you already are.
Ross, please, I found the magazines!
IF you hold a spider.
Monica, will-will you marry me?
Oh, well okay. Well, there you go.
What? You really think she's hot?
Really it's nothing. I'm just...
You guys wanna get some coffee?
Whoa, how do you know about that?
Yeah, Monica's settin' me up.
Oh yeah. That makes sense.
Why the hell didn't you tell me!
Third one from the left?
How did it go with Erin?
Not even one more time?
Yeah, yeah I like him a lot.
Okay, umm, I'm gonna get my sweater.
Eh. Beth dies.
AND YOU KNOW!!!
Oh my God! You look so beautiful!
Hi! Oh you guys look so beautiful!
Hey Ross! I brought reinforcements.
I don't really care about the Knicks.
What is this? Ross, what is this?
Wait, I-I just said "leave."
But we should move quick.
Oh no, I can't. I got a date.
Aw. Hey, Pheebs, want this?
Oh my God! Oh, I cannot believe it!
Oh really? Like what Monica?
Umm, can I use your bathroom?
Here comes another contraction.
No, I stuff outside the bra.
Ohh, I mean it's just so realistic!
Awww, awww, it's beautiful.
That is the Coast Guard.
What did, what did he say?
Hi. Ohhh, you got my message.
No, I think that was the whole all.
You were gonna drink the fat.
Oh my God Monica, who is that?
I just, I feel, I-I just...
You stole them from me!!
Ross, my father doesn't hate you.
Yeah, we're gonna let you be alone.
No so we're protecting her.
Oh come on, I already went.
So I'm thinking about you. So what?
Oh, Phoebe, do I wanna hear this?
I said it's still nap time.
Let's dry 'em again.
Oh yeah, she can't be herself.
No. A break from us.
You mean the one that you're wearing?
Ohh, I like swimmer's bodies!
Joey! I can't believe you just did that!
You let Joey drive it?!
Okay, well, we won that one.
I didn't know you could get married here.
But Pheebs, y'know you earned it.
I just don't want to be alone tonight.
Thank you. Okay, twenty dollars.
Joey, you have got to take this back!
Ooh, ooh, ooh,ooh,ooh. Hi.
Oh no! Not me! Emma!
So now, what are you doing here?
Whoa-whoa-whoa, let's say more!
Oh my God, I gotta go to work!
What is this? What are we doing?
You're out of Diet Coke.
You're out of toilet paper!
What-what are-what are these?
It's a pretty cool tux.
Monica, where did you get these?!
Ok. If you really need to.
Oh, oh. . What is this?
No, was he any good in it?
And... taped back together.
Alright! Enough out of you!
I want the little round waffles.
Oh, look at her, so happy!
Yeah!!! Kill 'um!!!
Well why didn't you take the job?
I can't... I can't hear it again.
Turned out it was a hat.
I can't. Please, you do it for me.
I meant, me plus one!
How'd it go with Pete?!
Yeah well, I'm-I'm a slut.
It's worse than the thumb!
Take it like a man, Ross!
Hi Joey, how ya doin'?
Well, y'know what, that doesn't matter.
Oh God, I really had a good time!
Oh, God, he's such a pig,
So maybe something in an office.
You've being seeing someone?
OK, I'm doin' it for ya.
Well, look at that, same thing.
Oh no. No Ross, don't do this.
Okay. Oh, yeah... Oh he's cute!
It'll be a short one.
So Pheebs, pick one of them.
About an hour ago.
Hey Joey, can I ask you something?
I think it could be kind of great!
Oh, yeah. Definitely you, Pheebs.
Ugh, Monica, I know about you and Chandler.
Oh wow. Are you in trouble.
No, yeah, Ive done that.
Okay. I'm sorry. You're right, you're right.
Why aren't you home yet?!
I don't get this! She was horrible!
Really? You think that's all it is?
I don't care, I'm not going anywhere.
Pretty uhm, different huh?
Happy New Year, Joey!
Ross, I am a human doodle!!
You dont even have cats.
No, it was just the three of us.
Did you just say Hi, Jew?
Well relax, he'll be here.
Men just take out wind?
Why would I have to sleep with you?
No-no-no, that' not Joshua.
You mean, you mean 30 days?
Ooh great! Very Monica.
Excuse me, there was no time!
What're you guys doing out here?
Okay. Okay, see? I get the phone.
Well, what-what 'cha got there?
That proposal, at the planetarium...
Ross, it's okay. You can come out.
Wow! I don't know, maybe. I'm...
What? I was just trying to teach you.
Would anybody like more coffee?
Oh, gosh, it's hot in here.
Yeah, I do. I-I do, do that.
Hi! Wow! You look, you look...big.
Well, we never actually got to dinner.
Sure we should... So.
Bloomingdale's eliminated my department.
Oh, please, you wanted to get caught.
It's not random, it's Bob.
Joey, how do you make that dirty?
Isn't that a kind of sushi?
Yeah, well, I gotta work, I'm sorry.
I'm gonna need a copy of those.
I don't know...right, he's the pig!
Ross, what is taking you so long?
I'm sorry honey, what were you saying?
Yeah, it couldn't hurt to look.
Can any of you watch Emma?
Heey man, I work out.
Oh! My hero! What happened?
No, you could've lost your job.
Op, I like credit cards!
We can't. We're not pharmacists!
No, you know what, I think you should go.
We got some really great stuff!
Well, I didn't know what else to do!
Ohhh! That is soo sweet!
Well then I demand a recount!
You are having a party tonight??
Chandler!! Are you gonna call her!
Hi! You're back from your date!
How often do you read it?
Oh, wow, Molly is just great!
All right, all right. Let's go!
Oh. Amy! Happy Thanksgiving.
Oh God. Is she gonna be okay?
Wh--Why don't I tell you over here?
Uhh, the mailman, the super.
Are you breaking up with us?
What? Oh my God! To who?
Well, can I talk to you for a sec?
Anybody wanna trade? Oh...
Because, uh-it has to.
Are you okay? You're not blinking.
Ohh, Phoebe, what am I going to do?
Yeah! No that's what I was thinking.
Oh... what an interesting name.
Which one do you think she is?
Oh, not much. I-I got a job.
You want me to talk you out of it?
Whoa! Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Oh, I can not believe you didn't tell me!
Well, get back in there and talk!
I - I have to get on the plane.
Hey, Ross!!! I told you I don't!
Oh my gosh. Wow, so beautiful.
Oh god. I think I'm gonna be sick.
All right, it won't come off!
Okay, bla-bla-bla-bla!! Who is it?!
You're a pathetic loser, right?
Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks!
How is that the silver lining?
Wow! I can't believe you lied to me.
Sorry, I thought you were talking to me.
Yeah, right away Mr. Kaplan.
Uhh... I think I just got engaged.
Oh no, no, I'll be there too.
Ah, all right. Here's to Ross!
She didn't hang up either!
Wh-You dated my sister!
Ohhh, I-I would enjoy that!
Ohh, of course Monica's brother!
Oh my God! The millionaire's here!
We love you, we're here for you.
I'm gonna marry someone good y'know.
Op, ice. I need ice.
Joey, did you my face cream?
That's because he's on your neck.
I am so hot for you right now.
I can too eat by myself!
Phoebe, I mean, you do know he's married?
Shake that nasty butt...
I do. I really do. I don't know anything.
You-you're not wearing a jacket.
Yeah, I guess Gunther is kinda...
She dropped off a casserole?
Oh you guys thanks for doing this.
Why did you invite my mother?!
All right, I'll see you guys later.
I don't know... sometimes it doesn't.
I did not know you spoke French.
Oh yeah. All right, back to work.
I don't care about any of that!!
Oh. Here's your moisturiser. Hi!
Well, that's because of a lot of...
No! No-no, I love it. Thank you.
Ok honey, you really need a job.
No you really think that's what it is?
Okay, well then bring her in.
Whatever! Okay, I'm not your mother.
Hey, how'd the interview go?
Well, I-I could live without it.
Okay, Ross, it has to be realistic.
Oh, great, Are you gonna be ok?
Oh... Oh my God. He remembered.
Oh wow! Look at this place!
Were both of those Joey?
Does anybody want anything else?
Can somebody please go in?
Oh my God. Did you talk to him?
Ohh! Thank God! Where was it?
Hey, Mon, you want some help?
Well, I was gonna let you play with it.
Really, I shouldn't feel guilty?
Mon, honey, I gotta ask you something.
Joey, you are not! You're 31.
Well we're gonna miss you around here.
You're just staring into space.
What? What!?! You kissed him?
Oh, did you not want people to know that?
Ok professor or detective?
Well look, if you don't like this...
Well, honey that was pretty obvious.
Oh, I read that in high school.
Well tell us! What are they?
What?! No! I'm not gonna move out!
Then what's with all the bananas?
Yeah well unless we tell him.
Okay, but Ross just listen to me...
Would you excuse me for a second?
Ok Monica: We will!!
No. I was just going to do this myself.
Oh okay, I see what you're doing there.
You are ready to make a commitment!
Wow! I can't believe that's our baby.
High-five, the babies are coming!
Come on, just answer the question!
No its really okay... Monica!
I know, I know. I went a little crazy.
Not even with your best friend.
Wow. She does that a lot!
Jurassic Park could happen.
Okay Monica, did you know about this?!
Yeah, honey, they wouldn't miss this.
Yeah, no. Ross has a PhD.
Well, congratulations, so do you love her?
Okay. What?! What are you doing here?!
You really think it would be that different?
Okay, y'know what? Maybe I should go!
I've never lived like this before.
Never happened! Good night!
Okay! All right! How was she?
I could not have done this without you.
No, I don't think we'll be doing that.
No, Phoebs. I'm dating Russ.
Well, I brought the next best thing.
Time is money my friend?
Ross, can you pass me the yams?
Wow. There it is, I see it.
Oh! Oh my God! What did I just do?
Well, we are ready to try anything.
Oh. Yes! I would so move out!
Phoebe hates Pottery Barn?!
Actually, I just wanna talk to Tag.
Ahh... Chandler's on the couch!!
It was only 500 bucks.
Chandler, can you give us a minute?
Hi Joey! What are you doing here?
You went shopping for fur?
All right. I'm a total pro!
Really? But I'm being so unreasonable.
Uhh, we still need a tip.
Noo! Maybe! I, I don't know.
Oh, don't be such a baby! end.
Does anybody need more coffee?
Bye. What a manipulative bitch.
You just did a little dancy thing.
...It's kinda hard though!
Oh Phoebe, I'm so happy for you honey.
Oh well, you don't want to do that now?!
Uh Ross? You asked me that.
And all these people actually died?
No! You gotta hold my hand!!
What? Did her ass explode?!
And Monica, what are you going to make?
Why? Honey, what is the big deal?
Oh please, you inhale your food!
Really?! So this has happened to you?
Okay, no uterus, no opinion.
How have you never been on Oprah?
And your fly's still open...
Oh, you're not having fun, are you?
Okay, even this is turning me on!
Okay, y'know maybe I should come back...
So did you break up with Joanna?
Okay! All right, pick a half.
Noo! I wish! Okay, you ready?
Oh, please, miss, you don't understand!
All right, so we weren't prepared!
Why aren't you guys at the movie?
Oh my God, he dream-cheated on you!
God. You seem really, really nice.
Oh, God! Please, somebody say something.
Oh my...God! Let me see that!
No, I know! I get it! It's funny!
has your girlfriend got the butt?
All right, straight, and not subtle.
Well, then so you just invite me...!
Oh! Screw it, I didn't get it!
Oh, that's very-Really very-very okay.
It depends on who asked.
But Ross, you want the name Ruth!
Well y'know, I don't want you to be cold.
Fine! I'm sorry for your loss!
And you are a very funny clown.
Nah, uh, uh, uh, uh.
Well, yeah! I'm still pursuing that.
I hope you're going somewhere with this.
Monica! I'm not gonna screw it up!
Thank you. Hello? I still don't get it.
Oh, you bought me a present! Why?
You all know? Does Ross know?
Any sign of your brother?
Well what is it? Let me see.
Oh! Phoebe, all babies are beautiful!
Because I promised Mindy I would.
Ohh, big, fat bummerrr.
I got a touchdown! We did it!!
He got it a flea market!
No! God, would you just calm down!
But he has to know how I feel!
Wow, he must like you the best.
Oh, it's just an anti-theft device.
Yeah! Remember I got that uh, gala.
What...how is it going with Drake?
Hey, you.... So, what's up?
Ye-, no, my Uncle Hi.
Oh, it's perfect! But not for tonight.
Ugh, I just gotta get the thing back!
Yeah, okay, at ease solider!
Right, I'll see you guys later...
Well, maybe you didn't want it to end?
But I told you, I didn't have the time!
I get to hire my own assistant!
I'd do anything for you, you know that.
You're fly is open, Geller!
Well don't you have that big date tonight?
OK, I'm guessing this is from...
What? You don't want me to get a job?
Oh yeah! You really-You look great.
Oh, yeah, I'm not, I'm not hungry.
Well, my eye is a little itchy.
Well,sounds like you two have issues.
SSSHHHHTTT!!He's asking her a question!!
Could you please get her attention?
Oh my God! What does that thing do?
Oh. Oh, it's beautiful. I see it now.
Are you makin' him a sandwich?
Hi! All right, let's go shoppin'!!
Oh c'mon Joey, we care about you.
What, the blonde with no bra?
Really? It doesn't seem desperate?
So who else was in this club?
You know it was you're uhm... birthday...
Oh, stop that, stop that right now.
All right are you guys gonna come down?
Oh, no, no. That is a doll.
I'm on the phone! Dr. Wiener?
Oh yes, of course, I remember him!
Geez Ross, you could have showered.
Oh my God! Really?! Can I see it?
Okay, go to the left. The left!
Okay, you guys, just relax. I doooo.
Ball? There is no ball.
: We have apple cinnamon...
Pheebs? Could you get that? Please?
Oh, no sit-ups today Tag?
Why-why aren't you more excited?
Oh, I'm not doing it alone. I have Ross.
Umm... I'm never gonna getting married!
Hi! Tag. What are you doing here?
And that's Phoebe , and that's Joey.
Look at it, isn't it beautiful?
Down at the docks again?
And a crappy New Year.
Great set tonight Phoebs.
So, did you shave your legs?
No! Wait! Wait-wait! Ross, please!
No matter how much we want it.
I don't even know how I would go about it.
I know, I can do more than cook.
I want to tell you to have a good honeymoon!
Ross, it just wouldn't have been feasible.
Let us keep the apartment and...
Uh. Did you call your parents?
Well, apparently he scares easy.
Was that all you wanted to ask me?
Vrrbddy, the bll is drrbing.
Good! I'm glad it's not a problem.
Yeah but, he's not your type.
Time's up, now your dead.
Yeah do it now, call right now.
Of course, I'd be honored!
So, is this just gonna be you and Carol?
Oh honey he doesn't need my help.
Okay! I got the keys! Okay! Okay!
Phoebe, honey, wanna get some breakfast?
Get out, get out of my apartment.
Okay, okay, okay should I be scared?
So how's it goin' with Joey?
She won a thousand dollars!
So it would just be, me alone?
Foot rubs for a month!
I don't know! Maybe they have tools.
Oh my God you stole her award!
Yeah. You're not gonna end up alone.
So you eh, you talked to Joey?
Nah, I don't really want her to see.
Well, I'm sorry, I thought you needed them!
Well it stupid, unfair question!
Okay! So, we'll just stay married.
Oh, you poor little famous man.
No-no, they're not very nice people.
What? Oh, I'm sorry, I can't, I'm busy.
Oh tomorrow, oh I don't know. Um...
Chandler, there's a guy right over there.
He doesn't speak much English.
There's no room under the bed.
That's a line from the show too!
Hey, Mom? Having fun?
Come on, they were not that huge.
No! If there was I wouldn't tell you.
And that makes you angry because...
You didn't break up with that fireman?
Yeah and there's really cute guys there.
Hey, that was an honest mistake!
How long do cats live?
Okay, just give me the damn drops!
Oo! When's her birthday?!
Uuuh!! How about at a Footlocker?
Oh! I would love to read a poem.
Wow! I can't, I can't feel my hands.
"Dude, Where's My Car?"
Yeah honey you don't believe her do you?
Off to see young Ethan?
Honey, Monica, this is ridiculous! Look...
Yeah. Why? Is that weird for you?
Are-are you saying he's a geek?
Oh, I'm sorry! Do you need the phone?
Good day for married people huh?
No, we kinda broke up instead.
Oh, it's so much more fun with you.
And stop saying that! I hate that!
You are asking me to be your wife!
It's over! You have to accept that.
Uh, it was very nice meeting you.
Yeah that's actually a pretty good idea.
Shoot. Oh, I can't believe I did this!
How come you didn't come over earlier?
Ooh, good God, they're so yummy!
Ugh, those bastards! Let's go.
How can you not remember us kissing?!
Hi Tag! What are you doing here?
Okay, y'know what? I'll-I'll have toast!
Well y'know, we did other stuff too.
Hey, who's this little naked guy?
Joey has got a secret peephole!
Yeah, he's back. Is that a problem?
I knew it! I knew it, ahh....
I got a really incredible job offer.
Yeah, but, there were no suds.
All right, I'm gonna make more margaritas!
Oh! I do not have chubby ankles!
Ross, you had sex with another woman!
Okay, I need a, I need a drink!
Nope. We took her to lunch.
Oh, it was great. Mark is so sweet.
Shhh! I want to hear the rest!
NO, no science camp!
Oh God, I know I'm a pathetic loser.
Oh, God, ask them what they want.
Oh good God! I've fallen down!
I haven't seen him in so long!
I mean it's the end of an era!
I was laughing! You made me laugh!
I'll help you throw out your purse.
Honey, you got a little thing on your...
Hey, umm, can I ask you guys something?
I can not believe your trading me!!
Oh, we're leaving. Bye Kash.
Oh, oh, I love that Japanese place.
I'm just kidding! You can go pee!
Great! We will do all of those.
Hi! Emma will be up in a minute!
Get the hell out of there, y'know?
Wow you, you. I had no idea.
Okay, well, we brought you some wine.
So, like, you guys all have jobs?
Hey, Mon, I was just doing the dishes!
What, what's it, what's going on?
Oh, okay. Will you take my place?
Ohh, thank you, thank you, thank you.
I don't know why they didn't just tell us.
What? Shut up! We're winning!
And you really think this is a good idea?
Yes, we should. I think we should.
I don't know! I mean, what brought that on?
Hi Dr. Long, how are you?
No, absolutely. Y'know like it was umm...
You would do that? I never get picked!
Oh, I don't know. I guess we have to eat.
You know, actually it's more like, hi.
Since when do you watch the news?
Honey don't worry, it was my mistake.
Okay mommy, don't ever leave me.
Hey, what have you guys been up to?
So can we keep this between us?
Oh, well you know who I love the most?
Oh, I'm sorry I spoiled you're evening.
Okay that is the one we already have!
Do you guys know any cute guys?
Oh good. Ahhh! My God, sorry!
Well, I-I should've told you the truth.
Who are you saying "check" too?
I thought you only met him once?
It's not? When was she born?
Yeah, I mean, you should play in public!
Somebody got in late last night.
That's weird, she locked the door.
How many guesses do you get?
Yeah, but I'm pretty sure he's gay.
Oh, you are losing. Definitely losing.
That almost hit me in the face.
Good, Pheebs. What'd you buy?
'Cause I don't need your stupid ship.
Your fly is open, Geller.
Oh, screw you guys, you don't have to do it!
People are trying to sleep in here!
Here. I thought you might be cold.
Ok... "Emma just said gleba"!
Ok, uh-uh... Let's-Let's shop!!
Okay, get ready to see some beggin'!
See? Now, he could date her.
Honey I swear it we just kissed.
I cannot believe Ross is buying this!
Ssshyeah, well, duh! I mean...
But, but, Mona, I live here.
You can't, because of the new skylight!
Ross, why do you hate our child?
Wow! Spinning that sounds like fun.
I mean he just started going out with her.
Um, there was a Geller Cup?
So, Joey, what are you gonna do for us?
How about 600 and these earrings?
Ohh, you've waited soo long.
Oh God, that's right. I blocked that out.
They made you head of the department!
Oh, terrific! That'll be $2,000.
Whoa! Wait! Hello! What about me?
Well, what are you guys doing tomorrow night?
Okay, that we may be able to do.
Oh, slides. So really nothing happened.
I'm thinking, I'm gonna order a pizza.
Take the top down did ya?
Okay, let's do it. I'll move in.
I know that. That's why I was getting married.
Just give us our apartment back!
Ross, honey, is there anything we can do?
Ok. Thank you for coming with me today.
Okay. Just give us a second. Ross!
Well, y'know I-I don't know where he is.
Isn't that a line from the show?!
Yeah. Who's workin' for you babe?
It... You can so totally tell.
I'd need an expense account.
Uh, he took the SAT's for me.
Oh! I have your key. Here you go.
I just don't know! It just doesn't feel right.
Hi! Hey, Happy Valentine's Day!
This is how I would hold a football.
...if you tell me, I might do it.
Oh they're pushing! They're pushing!!
Uh, actually, I think I'm gonna be busy.
That is the sweetest thing, I just....
And I also brought my friend Joey...
Ohhhhh. That's how it got fixed!
Okay, you want me to stop at the ATM?
Ah, so what are we looking at?
Great! Now he's gonna know it was me!
Good, good, good, good, good.
Ooh! Oh wow this is so beautiful.
Okay. Are you sure you wanna hear this?
Hi, I'm back. Listen, I need to...
What? What's what you were afraid of?
So, uhm... what are you gonna do today?
Because she hates Pottery Barn.
Oh yeah! I mean, that was pretty intense.
What are you ever gonna use that for?!
Uh, look Ross, this really isn't easy.
Okay, maybe they are not funny to you...
Call her! Call her now!
"Yeah. That works for me."
Well, at least that's a great suit.
Hi mum, put her back on!
Hey, they were popular when I left!
Hey, hi! Hey, where've you been?
Get your hands out of there! No!
The ring from the cave, yeah.
Oh, now see that's a fancy but.
Wow! Would I have seen you in anything?
Are you seein her again tonight?
You were really gonna do that, weren't you?
Well...did you know he was gonna ask me?
Y'know, I'm still 29 in Guam.
Y'know Bob in Human Resources...
No, we didn't get married! That's ridiculous!
So, um, will you bring the truck?
Sure. I just sharpened her this morning.
Can I talk to you alone for a minute?
Well, Phoebe set me up on a date.
Well, there's two spots left right?
Oh! I've got a lot of those too!
We are so gonna find them this year.
Oh you did, there are twenty in here.
Why, how much is this gonna cost?
I wouldn't know what I'm gonna do without you...
I am. Let me just get my coat.
Yeah well what are you, his boyfriend?
We feel so terrible about this, Ross.
Great, shoot, what are we gonna do?
I'm sorry, Rosita? As in...
Phoebe, it's okay. I like living with Joey.
Who ? Joey: Me.
Oh you went to the movies by yourself?
Okay, you'd tell me the truth. Right?
What?! Chandler, what is the matter with you?!
Huh. Well, uh, that's uh, that's interesting.
Oh, right! Wait a minute, I do that too.
Well those are very popular frames.
So you guys go, have a really good time.
Joey, where did you learn that word?
Yeah, that'd be great. I'd love it.
Uh yes, heroin and crack.
I'm just sort of in the middle of something.
Yeah! All right, I'll see you guys later.
What if she jumped out the bassinet?
Op! Wait, you dropped a pea.
Oh, oh Ross, oh my God, are you okay?
Phoebe just found out about Monica and Chandler.
To get you to make out with him!!!
Oh, Monica, c'mon, you do cool things.
No, it's all right. I got nice boobs.
Hello? Who are we spying on?
Hi, and I am also Emma's mother.
Why on earth would I understand this?
That is neither here nor there.
All right, then you owe me $350.
Wow, so why don't you go talk to him?
Y'know who I always liked? Mork.
You don't want to work for a guy like that.
Honey, maybe we should take you to a doctor.
My boss wants to buy my baby!
I say 'cheesy line', but ok.
Ehhh, no, I wanna do Phoebe's thing.
Will you stop calling it your apartment!
Oh what, you-you want both of them?
Don't!! Honey, what are you doing here?!
Okay, calm down, here they are.
Me, Fledermaus, great. I really-
No, no, it's just that it's getting late...
Oh! That would be sooo much fun!
Monica, how come you never told me this?!
Aah! Why? What are these for?
You know, he was just doing his job...
All right... Oh, Emma loves him!
It happened! I am telling you it happened!
Kinda hurtin' my hand though.
Wow! If only more people knew.
Oh! Look! I have a sonogram picture!
Grammy, Best New Artist.
My gynecologist tried to kill me.
Well now it's an empty bar.
I know. It seems smaller somehow.
Uh, we are here to break up with you.
So, will I like any of these guys?
Did I miss it? Did I miss it?
But you did! I mean, let's be honest.
How could you not tell me you worked here?
Cat! What'm I saying? Cat!
You guys are really right...there aren't you?
: Sak's... Fifth... Avenue.
Do you even know who Kip is?
Joey, Joey I love you so much, but I...
Thank you, thank you, thank you, Pheebs.
What-what if I marry Ross-Or Joey?
Yeah! I'm going to Paris. Thank you, Ross!
I know I told you, it's a really big problem.
Seriously, your dad doesn't like pranks.
Ben, its Rachel! But whatever.
Hi! Oh, how was your date last night?
Ah, did I leave the stove on?
Yeah, you started it! I've got to chill.
Sure! God, please take those off!
Hey! Umm, do you guys have any juice?
The meeting with the guy went great?
Please, no, go, that'd be fine!
So did you read your evaluation yet?
Phoebe, I thought your dad was in prison.
Oh, God, oh, God, I mean it's just so.
Oh, god, I know it, that I freaked you out.
Hi Danny! Wow! Thirsty huh?
You took the same class twice.
Yeah and I'm a horrible, horrible person.
No don't! Go back to repeating!
Wo-women? You mean like old women?
Chandler gets it! It's Chandler Bing!
Come on, Joey, I did it and it was fine.
Hey Joey, how'd the audition go?
He's perfect, he's never been better.
You're all gonna be aunts and uncles.
No-no-no! No, no, no, we're not married.
N-no, Emma dropped her sock.
Thanks, you can just put it on the table.
You're gonna be late! Go! Go!
Okay, gotta go! Wish me luck!
Hey Phoebe, can I talk to you for a second?
No sorry hon, Monica's orders.
Yeah, we got him back. Everything's fine.
What?! My mom's not gonna be here?!
Do you even know what a vicar is?
Ross? Can we just close the door?
No! Seriously! What's wrong with you?!
Uh-huh... why... do you not like them?
You promised you would break up with her!
Even so, I think I'm gonna pick Ross.
Oh! So you're driving up to Connecticut?
Make love? What are you a girl?
God, you have to tell me what happens tomorrow!
Oh no, Baby Girl Geller-Green.
Oh, you are the lesser of two evils!
Chandler, relax, Chandler, she'll be here.
Oh God... Oh, he's in there right now?
Okay guys, way to wish me luck!
No way. No way did you do this.
Oh screw her, that part is mine!
Hang in there. You hang in there.
Oh, y-yeah, so, you-you love me!
Oh wait Chandler, too many cooks...
Manhattan does not have enough stores.
Yes! Thank you! Exactly! You want it?
Well what?! How-how much is it?!
Oh no, at the Grammies I always win.
Oo, toes!! Well, for some people.
Ross, please, don't be so scared of him!
Then, you will definitely get him back!
Ewww, ewww, ewww, ewww!
Y'know what? Let's, let's talk later.
Hey-hey! Oh, look at you, all sexy.
Well maybe I'll just stay here with Monica.
Well, yeah... Okay, look it's about me and...
Y'know, it is not like I did this on purpose.
Some uh, some visual aides.
Oh no! My new Paolo shoes!
What's your favourite thing about summertime?
Huh, well maybe it uh, it changed.
Huh-hoo, yeah, no, it's still basil.
Ross said my name. Okay? My name.
Hi! I just wanna--Ahhh!!! Oh my God! Oh my God!
Monica. You've, you've done it right?
Oh!! My God, what are you doing here?
Yeah, I think she wants the old one back.
No, you have it, really, I don't want it-
Can I please be there when you tell her?
Sorry I'm late, but I left late.
This one is uh Paul O'Neil.
Oh, this lipstick looks just great on you.
Now Joey, what did the duck do?!
Whatever Linus, I'm opening mine.
Well, what happened to your jam plan?
How is you drinking helping the kids?
Ohh, so no sign of Emily huh?
Joey. Honey what would I do without you?
No, not that, I mean, what about you and Mindy?
Oh, Pheebs, I don't even know where to start.
Why are- why are you so tanned?
Oh... ... Oh my God. He remembered.
W-What are you, what are you talking about?
No! Don't say that! Don't say that!
You went out with a guy in the Navy?
Oh, you know what? Rachel.. She just left.
Oh God twenty seconds my ass!!
No, I meant with the dropper over here.
I'm just visiting my good friend Carol.
Well and clearly not a minute sooner.
No, it wasn't. It was actually the...
Ok, I will have the uh, side salad.
I got-I get a big pay raise!
Oh God, even his knock is boring.
I guess I can talk to one of my supervisors...
Yeah, and I am okay with being a pushover.
I don't have any issues with my Father.
Okay, I'm just gonna write this out to cash.
Oh my God! You got her to stop crying!
Yeah, I can't *wait* to go back to work.
Um, what- what would make you think that?
Hey, Pheebs, quick question for ya.
Okay. Okay. Joey, it's okay. Settle down.
So Pheebs, what do you want for your birthday?
Oh, I went to have pizza. With Danny.
Oh! Well, um.. You've got plugs!
I was just going to say that I left my keys.
Oh, just tell us! We're not gonna want it!
I don't know. Maybe I'll know when I see him.
All right. What's your news, Amy?
Not for me. Chip and I broke up!
I'm not here! That's just my Chinese food!
I haven't seen you in like.. a year.
I-I-I-I'm just...I'm just a good kisser!
Well then why did you give me a ring?
Okay, Ross, I'm really trying to tell you something here.
Cute guys in little shorts? Sure.
Oh no, not in my room! I'll get him.
Ahhhhh, salmon skin roll.
Wiener, Wiener Wiener, Wiener!!!
No, I will. I'm just not up for it tonight.
You can't move. You just... you just can't.
Ish. I just don't think I can bear it.
You. Like you haven't done enough.
I can't. I'm busy. I'm apartment hunting.
Yeah, I'm doing okay. I'm um...let's talk.
Oh shoot! I work Monday nights.
Hey! That's just poking me in the eye!
Alright, Monica, I want you to have the first taste.
Well of course that is what I'm here for!
And now you're watching me walk away.
Why does it matter so much to you?!
What, because that's your answer to everything?
Oh, wow. Super ass-kissing power.
What are you doing?! Get in the front!
Oh, him, the little guy? Oh, I love him!
Oh my God, Phoebe, are you gonna go to jail?!
Can I see you in my office for a minute?
You need to learn some new slang.
Oh, oh, that's what you're talking about. Hey.
Open it! Open it! Open it!
Not gonna find any clothes in there!
Maybe that's all we do, what about Julie?
Oh my God, they let you keep that stuff?!
I'm doin' good, baby. How you doin'?
Joey, come on! We just went over this!
Wow! Well, clearly this is not a good time.
Yes! But what is wrong with this dog?!
I don't know. Do I have to decide right now?
What? Oh my God! I'm gonna miss you so much!
Why, when did you get out of the game?
Hey, don't listen to them. I think it's sexy.
Oh honey, I'm so proud of you, Min.
Well, I guess that's all in the past, now.
Babies don't care if they're slim.
Hey Mon? I'm gonna check my messages.
Ohhhhhh, look it's the roller blades.
Wow! Whoa-whoa what's under the covers?
But I-But everything is okay. I'm fine!
Aw what are you?! A detective?
Huh... wow, so he's gotta be...
Wow, I really get crabby when I cook.
No, everything's fine. I just gotta go back...
Me? Oh, no, I am not an actress.
Have you ever seen so much crap?
Well then he gets a divorce, it's Ross!
I know, I know, so it is just not a big deal.
What? You just click when they click.
At his apartment. Is this juice?
When Carol was pregnant with Ben...
No-no-no! This chair's not going anywhere.
Yeah. Umm, unless you wanna come inside?
Ooh, I just feel bad, I never vacuum.
Alright. So where'd you grow up?
Ohh, wait a minute, we haven't pre...
What...that scene I saw was so good!
I don't know, what were the names I just said?
Wow! Mon, thanks! I love this plate!
And you're no friend to those with noses.
Well, Phoebe that's fine because I'm not moving.
I don't know. Y'know, they didn't get us anything.
Um-hmm. There we go. There it is.
Okay Ross, can I uh, can I ask you something?
What, what, what, no, I don't wanna do that.
Did he call? Did Mark call?
You wanna go inside and have some coffee?
Well, what's the other thing, what do I think?
And um, excuse me, he helps me.
Okay, you gotta give me some of your piece.
And a nice hot cider for Monica.
I'm so dead serious. I'm totally serious.
Ohh! It's so nice to meet you. Hello.
Come on see, she doesn't look that bad.
Oh, it's just like a bloodbath in here today.
Pheebs, could you maybe hand me a cracker?
Remember that big thing I was gonna tell you about?
Oh! Tommy, this is Ross. Ross, Tommy.
'Kay. Congratulations on your new job.
Hey, how's...how's the uh, miracle chair?
I-I, got a job at Ralph Lauren.
Please? YES! Sandy you're hired.
So, whaddya think George is like?
Hey. Gosh, you look soo familiar.
Guess who we ran into today?!
Pheebs, I don't think anyone's mad about that.
Oh yeah, they're really great! Aren't they?
Yes, the hard part is truly over.
Oh, it's just... Oh, Barry, this was not good.
But honey, I think she's moving in with Chandler.
Okay. Umm, what should we do for the theme?
Oh... that's too bad. Bye bye.
Already? That's pretty bad what you did.
So umm, what time are you supposed to leave?
That's right! You do what the hand says!
Oh! I remember laughing! I laughed a lot.
Hey, wait a minute! That is my sock!
Oh but look! That's gonna leave a stain!
You don't pick me! You're stuck with me!
Oh, she's coming up! She's coming up!
Oh my god, I left the water running.
That yeti is one smooth talker.
I don't think he's the one who needs help.
Alright, c'mon! Let's play Twister!
There isn't. There is totally isn't.
What do you mean you quit?! You can't quit!
Yeah, come on! What's going in on in there?
If we broke up, and I lost you...
Excuse me! You didn't tell him, did you?
Maybe, but shouldn't we wait for Chandler?
Wait a minute! What are you gonna tell Joanna?
Okay. Hang up! That's it! Come on!
Ugh, how can you even ask that question?!
Plus, you know, he is with Charlie now.
Honey, what are you doing? That's too heavy.
Okay, let me just get a cup of coffee.
I tried! They won't take her back.
Why, does she have a bad personality?
Oh! There's nothing above your bed!!
What?! Why? Joey you were so ready for it!
When did you go to a sperm bank?
Oh, wait Ross! I'm sorry, one more thing!
I a not gonna lie to you, I'm pretty sick.
Okay, y'know what? We don't need her measurements.
Why? You saw it? Is it scary?
Oh, if she jumps, I get her tickets.
Uh-huh. Y'know what I was, I was thinking about?
I'm gonna go get one of those job things.
Well! Good night. I'm going upstairs.
I got to figure out what I'm going to wear.
Aren't you a little cute to be a doctor?
Oh I don't know honey. It's gonna be really late.
Monica, you broke up with him for a reason.
OK, OK. I'm with you, Cheech. OK.
Hey, do you guys have any extra ribbon?
And you just get to be cool Aunt Phoebe!
I think you should definitely go out with this guy.
Come feel this! Come feel my belly!
Chandler Bing? It's time to see your thing.
Monica, I don't want to lose 200 dollars.
Yep! Happy and healthy! And cute!
Uh, Pheebs? Who's George Snuffalopagus?
You gave her a key to your apartment?!
Yeah, I did. I needed my lucky dress.
Let me, let me get you some wine!
Ross, I didn't think it would that big of a deal.
Joey I don't think you know what behalf means.
What? Wait! Why...why do you get the story?
I'm-I'm-I had no idea. I'm sorry. I...
Hey! Y'know what? Let's talk about relationships!
Rome. Jerk missed his flight.
Well just ask Mona to give it back!
Hi. Look um, about what happened earlier...
Is this a little too... Pheebs, what happened?
Oh, I don't think she likes the new Hugsy.
Agh, it was the graduation from hell.
Well, maybe that's, maybe that's really brave.
Ohh, you guys are so made for each other.
Oh, Phoebe, that really cute guy is here again.
I... Well, I don't think they need any help.
Um, seven...e-e-eight, eight years. Wow.
Three people. Joshua's not gonna be there.
Oh! Emma, that's right! You're that many!
Oh my God, look there's Roy Gublik.
If I said I was, would you judge me?
So are things with you and Joey any better?
Yeah, I know. It's ridiculous! I can't see you either.
Oh, really, let me see, let me see.
Oh now daddy, stay calm. Please.
I know! My God! Do you have your speech?
Umm, I think he's still out. What's wrong?
I thought I was making him filet mignon?
Whoa, look at you, you did pretty well.
Oh my God! You really are freakishly strong!
Oh wow, you are really, you're really a creep.
Luisa? Oh my God! Monica! It's Luisa!
Look at that guy by the window, wow!
Well, well, well, look what mommy found!!
Monica! Look! Hi! What do ya think?
Oh my God! Did you get to see anything good?
Oh, it's so late for 'Shall we'...
You were with Kenny today, weren't you?
All right, wherever you wanna go is cool.
Ooo! Oh, I forgot they made sheets!
What, it's ok when Chandler does it?
Chandler!! Promise me, you will end it.
Well, why doesn't he practice with a girl?
Oh yeah? Did he pull the old...
Nobody, forget it! Rachel: Maybe.
Wow! You certainly think a lot of yourself.
Yeah, why is it so hard for you to believe?!
Oh-oh, sorry, it's this way, it's this way.
I know, me neither! I mean, you had a sketch!
No! It's just that, Kate bothered me.
Hi! Is my misery amusing to you?
Okay. Okay. Okay. Joey, I have got to tell you something!
Well, then I lost it. You buy me one!
Well, because she loves you and because you love her.
Tell her to wear her own earrings.
Hi! Are you ready? We're gonna be late!
Ok, we never shoulda talked about this.
And so were-were you close to your parents?
Damn! I wish I knew if that was right!
Oh, I found him. He was Paolo's cat.
Ross, we actually watched the documentary together.
Alright, alright, so I'm not a great typist...
Oh, I can't. Because I-I've seen them.
Ok, let's not make a big thing about this!
Okay, you're right. You're right. You can't help me.
Ohh! You did not drop any socks!
See your twenty-five...and...uh, Monica, get my purse.
Oh you really, you really just don't want to hear about it.
Phoebe, you had a date three days ago.
Oh, come on, would you just grab my ass.
You have been maid of honor before?!!
Well, isnt, isnt that gonna be weird?
Stop it! Marcel! Bad monkey!
How many ways are there to do that?
Ross, you don't even have oven mitts on!
I was gonna give you a chance to apologise to me.
Hey, Mr Philips, nice suit!
Yeah, well, you uh, better make it for three.
I'm not asking you to go on a date with him!
Love you too... Alright, I'm going to bed.
My due date is in one week!
You guys are gonna come and visit me, right?
Gotta go! Hi! Wow! There you go!
Yeah well, you know what, so is uh, Sorentino's.
Well you could've untied it with your hands.
EHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!! My God!!!!!!!!!!! Oh my God!!!!!!!
No, it's not better. I still don't get to see you.
Do you want to put the book in the freezer?
And that's I'm so glad... there's no problem.
I mean, y'know I'm just gonna have to accept it ...
Open your drapes! Open your drapes!
Well, this is really awkward Oh, and I can leave!
I'm not moving! Is that picture straight?
It was really fun being married to you tonight.
Don't look at me I never get his jokes.
What?!! Stop it! Stop it! Oh my God!
Yeah! But I don't know what he looks like!
Wiper blades. I don't even have a car.
But I haven't used my card in weeks!
C'mon, he's right. Tit for tat.
Pheebes, this woman is voluntarily bald.
I wonder how Monica and Chandler could do it?
Oh God. It seems like forever ago.
Really? Who would, who would you marry?
Am I going to let you watch me undress?
Oh Pheebs, is that a new ankle bracelet?
Nooo, he's leaving for a better job.
Phoebe!! Phoebe!! It's okay!! It's okay!!
The thing is y'know, that you're married to Emily.
You can keep those pants by the way.
Phoebe, don't you think you've had enough to drink?
Ok, you know what, I'm just gonna take her outside.
Phoebe is gonna be Monica's maid of honor!
Oh, y'know what, I didn't want cinnamon on this.
Oh! Oh my God! I thought she was on Atkins.
Wha... are you kidding? I can't return this.
Thank you. What? You don't want to see this do you?
Oh my God! We have to throw her a shower?!
I think she's checking out your beehive Ross.
Wha.. well, Ella's a nice name!
Oh, I know... I know it's been really hard for you.
Wrong! How do you get the mainsail up?
Wait a minute! Why don't you guys do something?!
Yeah baby, I'll show you how we do it!
So honey, what are you gonna do about the little girl?
Ohh, so do you! Did you lose weight?
Umm, Joanna? I wanna talk about that interview.
Well, I kind of... I kind of lost him.
Well, maybe-maybe I could be your roommate Pheebs.
Oh I'm sorry, we're clo-... Hey sailor.
Okay so listen I'm gonna go lay down.
Oh, shoot. I had it. Oh, I can't believe this.
Okay, just a little scared. What's going on Ross?
Okay. Honey, I would love for you to go with me. What?
Well, at least you make each other laugh.
Yeah, we are definitely on Route 27.
A cyborg?! Isn't that like a robot?!
God how long do you think that's gonna last?
Joey...there's something that you...should know. Dina?
Yeah, Why? You don't think a woman can do this?
Monica, betting the apartment, I don't know about this.
No, Monica! Monica! We have to fix this!
Oh, she's so tiny. Where'd she go?
Oh yeah, I know, but the garbage was full.
No not that. I kissed Gavin last night.
Pat the dog. Oh! Oh! I get it!!
No, I was ten. I just developed early.
Got a job on a river boat?
No, no, no. It's ok. I'm gonna be fine.
Oh they're in the top drawer. Hurry.
Alright, that's it! Give it back! That's it!
Oh my God! Phoebe look, it's Ross and that girl.

Do you really want an award you didn't win?
Come on Phoebe! Don't be such a goodie-goodie!
Phoebe, Shania Twain is still alive!
Ross, I don't, I just don't think it's going to fit.
You think you're gonna get out of this on a technicality?
Phoebe, isn't Jethro Tull a band?
Well, I sorta did a stupid thing last night.

There were times when it wasn't even me.

Do you got your gracious loser face?
Well, yeah! We're cool. Totally cool.
Oh, come on! We know what these are worth.
Ooh, I have to go pack. It really does?
Oh for God sake just pick a piece!
Really?! How come we didn't cross paths?
Burning's good. Yeah, I got stuff to burn.
Oh my God, Monica's gonna go out with a millionaire.
All right. Okay Chandler, enjoy your handful.
We got locked out of the apartment, we ...
Oh, I'm sorry, I guess I just bring it out in him.
It's not a purse! It's a shoulder bag.
You are friends with Dr. Drake Remoray?
Well, we're not seeing each other, so....
You guys aren't doing anything tonight, are you?
Oh sure I am, because you always have to be right.
Oh, that's okay, girls tend not to like me.
Yes. Paolo sent them from Italy.
Yeah! His name is um, Mark something.
So-Hey, Pheebs! So, how are the elves?
Well, as long as we are clear about that.
Well, I guess we just find a divorce lawyer?
No, no, no... No, I mean... se-x-u-ally...
Okay. Walked right into that one didn't he?
Chandler, you stole this cheesecake. That is wrong.
Oh, hey, don't you have to go pick up Emily?
You could.... say you're sorry to her mom.
And I'm Rachel, an admirer of the building.
All right that's it! I am maid of honor!
Yeah, you like that baby? May we help you?
Phoebe, I bet somebody's missing that badge.
Can't I just look at the handles on them?
Now just how big of a star is Marcel?
I cannot believe I'm gonna meet Jessica Ashley!
Oh no, I can't tell you until you tell me what you know.
So you were in an I Hate Rachel club?
They're in Vermont!! How could this happen?!
No, it's been three nights in a row.
No, no, no, you said, "got the keys".
And you were at this job for four years?
You are the official baby crier stopper!
And you're still not attracted to him at all?
Well, I should think so. You slept with someone.

Oh, I'm sorry, you're right.I'm sorry, good luck!
Well, because of us! Because of our history.
Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here..
Well you're not gonna be able to keep doing this.
Well, we have gotta find out if he's alive.
I'm the hell person whose office this is!
Well maybe, maybe she's with us right now?
How could you not tell me that she has hair?
Wow, I am so glad I'm not Monica right now.
Okay, Pheebs, I was hoping for more of a change.
You're right, I don't have to apologize. Sorry. Damnit!
Chandler!! You have the best taste in men!
I'm sorry. I didn't-I don't come in here a lot.
Oh good, great! I'll-I'll keep that in mind.
You are never going to believe what happened to me today.
Ross said there's still no word from Chandler.
Okay, that was Phoebe Buffay, everybody. Woo!
Okay, now make it even, 'cause we don't...
Oh please, what do you know! You married a lesbian!
I don't know. I know I don't work late tomorrow night.

Oh, I'm sorry, did my back hurt your knife?
Hey, umm, do you guys have that tape measure?
Oh no-no-no! No, I got this all under control.
So Pheebs, what are you going to do with your $3?
Yeah, but you said, "Will you marry me?"
Whoops. Oh, hey, do you need help with that?

Yes of course, absolutely! You're right. I'm sorry.
Okay. You too. And I hope you score. Bye.

No no no, wait, I wanna see what happens.
Oh but Phoebe, we're gonna be late for the movie.
Really? Wow, this is so much better than I...
Okay, okay, okay, fine, I'm gonna look it up .
Well, are we all together? Like in a group?
I hope it's still funny when you're in hell.
Well, Chandler said that it's really important to him too!
Oh thank you! Oh God! Can I have another one?
Yeah sure, iced tea would be great.
HEY!! Do you have to do that? It's Saturday!
Joey, honey, I don't think you're supposed to go back there.
Hey! What happened to you? Why didn't you come up?
Relax! It's not like it's Citizen Kane!
Oh wait, I have the ten of spades! Here!
Oh Joey honey I don't...I don't want to lose...

Fine, I will. Alright, fill me in!
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's just...It's just so sad!

Okay, but Ross, eventually you and I are gonna be dating.
All right, we've got to tell her he's gone.
That's right. You're very cheeky for a temp.
Y'know, you should never be allowed to talk to people!
Oh! Ok. Ok, you really wanna know who it is?
People keep saying that. Oh I'm sorry Gavin.
Joey, what-what are you doing going into my bedroom?!
Ross, get over it! It's not like she hates you.
Okay, okay, could we change the subject, please?
You really, really need to get some sleep, honey.
We ended up having sex in his chair.

The most unbelievable thing happened to me today.
Well, what is a boss for? Hug it out!
You guys are unbelievable. No! He cannot come.
Shh-shh-shh! The guys don't know yet do they?
Oh, Ross, I'm sorry. I completely ruined your evening.
Ooh, do I sense a little bit of resentment?
Oh, Sophie, I guess you didn't hear about Joanna...
Can you believe what a jerk Ross was being?
Oh no. No-no! I think my water just broke.
These are from Halloween three years ago.
Oh, well, that's - that's very sweet. Thank you.
Oh nothing I... Sorry, I just can't stop crying.
I don't wanna hear "Three failed marriages!"
Well would you like me to lie down on the table?
What-what?! You're gonna leave this person with me?!
Can you please, please take care of it for me?
Well... well, what did you do to make her laugh?
Hey, it's not that big a deal, I was just curious.
Hello?! I still don't know what the hell I'm doing!
Aside from the fact that you said you had them?
Ohh, I love Joey! Joey lives with a duck!
I can't believe this! This is Emma's first Thanksgiving!
I just purchased the La-Z-Boy E-cliner 3000.
Okay-okay that-that's amazing. How did you know that?
Hey Pheebs, you're still alive! How are you doing?
Oh, thank you so much for coming. Ross, get in here!
It's a standard issue bra clasp!
Yeah! I am soo gonna marry that guy. Ohhh!
Yeah. Uh-huh, I guess it is pretty big news.
Ummm, I think it's time to see the ring again.
Oh my God! How long has she been crying?
Okay come on Phoebe, it's nothing! Monica, come on!
Excuse me? Oh yeah? Well, up yours too!
Actually, y'know that's not the Thanksgiving I was talking about.
Anybody! You, me, you know, Monica's mom...
Ross couldn't fit down the trash chute.
Ok. Wha...? where? Where are you going?
Oh, I blew it. I wouldn't of even hired me.
Ross, would you just stop it! It's getting really old.
Joey, why wouldn't you invite us to your parties?
So, which of this kitchen stuff is mine?
Yes, but still. They're people...with eyes.
Where's Chip, why isn't he here yet?
Heeeeey, where have you been? What happened to you?
I made the mistake of telling him that I was pregnant.
Oh, yeah, well hey, welcome to our sauna.
Well that works out good, because I'm not listening.
Oh, so you just sort of happened to leave it in here?
No-no-don't! Don't leave me here with these people.
Now, what exactly is in a cobb salad?
Oh I see, so this suit is making a point.
Oh! Whoops! I'm sorry, you were talking about Emily!
But your divorce isn't even final yet.
Not Joey, no, I was just lusting after Chandler.
No! Sorry, I just thought you were somebody else. Hi!
Only 'cause you took up half the circle.
Woah, woah, woah, what book is this?
Well, he gets the other one all riled up.
Well, that-that's not your choice. Happy Halloween!
Well, I'm also sending out.... good thoughts.
Yeah that seems fair. We never use them.
Yeah, well it was. I, I broke a cup.
Okay, but before you go, could you help me first?
All right, you guys, I kinda gotta clean up now.
Well, I'm sorry I'm not going to an eye doctor!
Why? Do you have the answers written on there?
Wh-Hey, I just gave you peeing on a stick.
"Baddest man in the whole damn town."
Hey, so did everything go all right with the annulment?
I know isn't it? It's like I'm right there with Joshua.
So my mother is not coming to my baby shower?!
Here he is. Hi. Guys, this is Russ.
You're right, you're right. I should just tell her the truth.
Wait, what do you mean you're getting a new brain?
Oh my God, they told us that was for the mascot!
But I already told Zelner that I would come back...
Yeah! I'm gonna have a boyfriend, you're gonna have a girlfriend...
Come on! You guys can pee standing up.
Even when we were having sex in that chair?
Yes! That I know, this is from White Plains.
Oh my God! You are giving this a lot of thought.
What?! What?! My birthday's not for another month!
No, I think it's very obvious who's wrong here.
Remember when we were in high school together?
Ohh, my new assistant is working out, yes.
Whoa! Hey-hey, you planning on inviting us?
Yeah, not girls anyway, guys agree like that.
Wait-wait where are you going? Where are you going?
Okay, I thought it was about your neighbors liking you.
Why? Why not?! People love to hear that!
Oh, yeah, check it. Definitely, I want some of that.
Yeah, I told you to give Emily whatever she wants.
Yeah, and Lennart Haze is starring in it.
No. What do you do if I say we are coming about?
Joey! Kinda in the middle of a story here!
Hi. Can Emma and I live here for a while?
But can it... just... happen a little bit?
Okay. Oh wait, wait-wait, you're not gonna come with me?
Yeah, right. Look at you, you're practically giddy.
This is Bonnie? This is Bonnie? You're Bonnie?
No, she was just much better at job than me!
Ross, what's the big deal? So I kissed the guy!
I don't know. Whatever I was feeling, I'm... not.
Do you still have that, um, Navy uniform?
Now the filet mignon, what comes with that?
Oh Ross, would you stop, you got me, I'm dating you.
Oh, 'scuse me. I was kinda using that machine.
Uh no, he's not. Can I take a message?
Because, I can't! Ross, I told you, no. I can't.
Oh, no, meh-nah-nah-nah, come on you're gonna ruin it!
Yeah, no, I don't-I don't put things in my eye.
No. And then I called him, and he wasn't there.
Dealer takes two. What do you bet?
Well, okay. Would-would you get me a Diet Coke?
Oh, please tell me it's not because I'm going with Mark.
Oh my God! That's so great! I'm so happy for you guys!
All gone! So, farm birds, huh?
Alright you guys, I'm takin' off my shirt.
Whoa! I can't believe you did that. That was really sweet.
What? What is so strange about me having a date?
That's it? Well I saw that! Ohh-ohh-oh, thank you.
I've got magic beans. Never-never mind.
All right, that's it, you guys! What happened out there?
What? Oh my God! I'm so sorry. Joey? Are you ok?
No. But don't worry, I'm sure they're still there.
Ohh, Lilies. Joey, they're my favorite. Thank you.
All right, so are we not having dinner at all?
Nice seizing. . . gel boy.
Ohh! Right! Right, sorry, I'll be right back!
I've never given her a cookie. Have you?
whoo... ok... wow... ok... OH!
I swear, I never wanted any part of your night!
I cannot, I cannot believe that I invited you here today.
Yeah, what, so? You had feelings for me first.
Well, maybe they can find a way to bring you back.
Oh, y'know, would you just for once, not remember every...little...thing!!
Because I think I just heard her moving around in there.
Maybe she hasn't really thought it through that well.
And I will make everyone call me Mrs. Geller!
Hi, I thought you might like some ice chips.
Thank you. Well, I guess we have some time to kill.
You're not the man who left the cell phone.
Oh, honey, don't worry. She's gonna make it on time.
Hi! I just want to apologize. I'm really sorry I was a baby.
I'm just kidding too. I'm getting married in December.
Did you not get a good enough look the other day?
Op, op, car! Car!! Ugh!!!
All right! Who's are they? Who's are they?
Wow! Wow. Wow. Wow, it is hot in here.
Wow! This is so amazing! What else? What else?
Oh well, y'know, the gala had to end sometime.
Timmy was my boyfriend and you made out with him!
Okay, it's missing something. Ooh, I know! Umm, okay.
Hey Ross! Any word on the apartment yet?
Dark, big hair, with the airplane earrings.
Well, that would've been very hard to say no too.
Okidoki! Wow! We're never gonna find a nanny.
Oh well yeah me too. Um.. I had a baby.
I don't know, I just kinda ran into him last night.
Yeah. No. And you know what? Nobody even saw!
Right, yeah, I've heard that about cute doctors.
Yeah, actually Daddy Ross is allergic to lobster.
Hi. Sorry, things aren't working out so well.
Oh, wow thanks! Oh you're in real estate!
That refrigerators don't live as long as people.
What? Wait-wait a minute, what? Phoebe, what's the matter?
Nice! One and a half carat easy.
Oh Phoebe, we forgot that party we have to go to.
Yeah... I, uhh... I have a... I have a date.
Well, you're not sixteen, you're both adults now.
O-o-o-okay, how did it go? Tell me everything.
Oh Pheebs that's so sweet--Ooh, those are so cute!
You gotta see these latest pictures of Emma.
Uh Pheebs, we just actually kinda wanted to be alone.
Wow. I, I don't even know what to say. Thank you.
Ummm. Oh! I'm sorry. It's a little old but...
Whoa, I'm sorry. Excuse me. We had this cart.
So, does this come in another color or...
Well, I'll ask him for you, if you want me too?
I can't talk to you. I can't even look at you right now!
Uh, well, I think, I think he broke up with me.
Okay. Seriously, breathe louder Ross! That's great!
So just bring it back downstairs, what's the problem?
Yeah! And until now, I didn't think I'd love again.
Well, I was gonna, but I accidentally read something else.
Chandler? It's Alan, he wants to speak to you.
Monica...would you please tell Joey that he is a pig?
Oh, Monica! Would you stop being such a wuss?
All right! Well, uh... we're gonna hit the beach?
You know what, Ross? I think we're gonna take off too.
Hey! You remembered to put clothes on this morning.
Oh, but look how straight those noodles are!
Want a wedding dress? Hardly used.
I-I-I of course, I have more responsibilities than that.
He's so cute! And he seems to like you so much.
Yeah but, I've never asked a guy out before.
Hey Pheebs, can I talk to you over here for a second?
Wait, I'm not just gonna drink somebody's old coffee.
Okay, a couple months late on the lecture, Ross.
Yes, of course there is! Okay? I'm not insane!
Umm, well let's see Monica and Chandler are occupied.
Oh well, too late, sorry, you already had some.
Well, screw charity work. What've you got?
Hi, I'm Rachel Green. What can I do for you Joshua?
Yeah, Joey kinda disabled it when I moved in.
Oh honey, thank you, but Mark's taking me out.
No! There is.. there is noone else!
Ross! Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me....
So umm, how-how are we gonna mess with them?
That was amazing. I can't even send back soup.
And uh, he will have a white wine spritzer.
Well, however great she was I just can't afford that.
Oh, could somebody give me a hand with this zipper?
What-yeah-what, y'know what? I hope Emily is a lesbian.
Seriously Pheebs, it's not gonna be that kind of a party.
Ohh, well I'm not totally back yet, but thank you.
What? What? Ross, you're scaring me. What's going on?
I'm sorry Pheebs, I guess I'm just really said that I'm leaving.
I am so psyched I kept this chair for myself!
Oh, come on Ross! I think it would be really good for you!
Oh, it's the best! So, umm how's Monica?
I know! I know, it's such a huge, life-altering thing.
Ahh, yes, I will have a glass of the Merlot
Ya know, Dr. Burke kissed me once.
Or ya know, he's rubber and you're glue.
Really nice to meet you... and we'll call you.
But Erin Brockovich had her own house.
Oh my God... What.. What are you guys doing here?
That was her idea, I just gave her a nudge.
Oh, well, you're not catching me on my best day.
OK... see your two... and I raise you twenty.
Here it is! I love it. I wear it all the time.
Yes! On a cake shaped like a bunny.
Oh my God! You're a 30 year old virgin!
Ooh, you guys, it starts in like 20 minutes.
Yeah, well, feminism yes, but also the robots.
Oh, honey, I'm sure there's nothing wrong with the plane.
Have you ever had any weird romantic dreams?
Oh, Barry..! Come on, this is all way too..

Is Monica around? I-I have to ask her something.

Or I'll give them to my new boyfriend, Joshua.
Ross? All this time? Well, I've got to talk to him.
I-I-I didn't! I didn't! She thought you were cute.
Cecilia Monroe man, what a great actress.
Well, get 'em out of here! What's wrong with you?
No, that day... that won't be her real birthday!
Y'know what, I want you to leave! Get outta here!
Oh, thanks. So, uh, what are you gonna do this summer?
Ugh, I knew it! Oh I cannot believe those two!

Ok, Ross, Ross, ok listen, what we have is amazing.
So what do you say? Can I be your girlfriend again?
So Chandler, have you heard about Monica's secret boyfriend?
Well, y'know this whole marriage thing, kinda my idea.

So, he's on the show, he knows what happens.
Ross, didn't you say that there was an elevator in here?
Hi. Listen, I was um, thinkin' about. . .
Yeah, pretty nice, huh? Now who's a pushover?
Oh, how does he look? How does he look?
Huh, that's funny. You look like you're gonna be the...
I don't know, it was you and a bunch of albino kids.
Oh my God! Oh Monica! Those boots are amazing!
Any chance you think the couch looks good there?
I'm talking about a bet, winner takes all.
yeah I didn't disguise that very well did i.
Yeah. Just to be sure I'm gonna call Dr. Wiener.
Oh my God! Why is he jumping on those women!
Well, y'know I was thinking of moving the couch over here.
Oooooooooh. Oh, that's nice. Oh, oh. Huh, Ross!
Shut up that was my friend Melissa from college.
Joanna, this is my friend Chandler Bing Joanna.
I do need you! I need you to stand near my head!
Hey, thanks Ross, for taking care of all of this.
Heyyyyy! Contraceptives are not always effective! Right?
Yeah, I know... ..I'm I'm just not that bright either.
Okay. Well be careful with her, she's really tiny.
Hi you. I can't believe I'm waking up next to you.
You remember not having sex in high school, right?
Oh Ross, hi! Hey, how are ya? There you are!
Yes, I've done my studying and I really know my stuff.
But y'know umm, Rachel doesn't rhyme with draddle.
Okay well Ross! Stop it please! Wait a minute!
Alright, Emma is napping... what happened to your shirt?
Oh yeah, now everybody wants to be under this hat!
Did Joey say what he was gonna go when he left?
Oh that's so great, now Emma has two Hugsy's.
You like that? Let's take this into high gear.
Then what's that big lump under your covers?
No!! You are getting married! This is all I have.
Well, I have a job interview at Ralph Lauren tomorrow!
Yeah okay, you laugh now, but she's gonna be yours.
Ugh, Monica I don't want to steal your stupid thunder!
Oh, but y'know, no, you didn't give me your phone number.
Hey, how are those tapes working out for ya?
Yeah, y'know I-I think I'm just gonna hang out in my room.
Do you even understand what off the rack means?!
Oh boy, I just can't watch. It's too scary!
Well, I've brought some books. We could read.
What's the big deal? Why don't you wanna see Janice?
Hey Mon, look what I just found on the floor. What?
Okay, you are going to tell her and you're going to tell her now.
Oh, you know what? Let's not say anything else. I love you.
Shhh...I don't know what to do, this is totally unprecedented.
Yes! Yes! Yes, you do want to know! This is unbelievable!
We are looking for our Christmas presents from Monica.
Well Monica seems to think it's because you have feelings for me.
Of course it's true and it hurts so bad.
Oh no, no, no. Oh God, you think I made out with him.
Hey guys do you think this is too slutty-Hi Kash!
Don't say, "Oh my God!" Oh my God what?
That is it! You just barge in here, you don't knock
All right, who would uh, like some yams? Will?
Hello. Umm, when is your next flight to London?
Yeah! You-you got the job! You're my new assistant!
Well, why don't you talk to me about it, maybe I can help.
Well better than you, but y'know still not what you want.
Yeah, I just get a little bummed when my birthday's over.
Okay, well, I'm gonna clear out some of these boxes.
Oh! Phoebe, why did you lie to me about working here?
Well, I guess I could take a couple days off work.
I'm doing just fine! God, Tiffany, you smell so great!
Guess what. Ben just said his first word.
Sure, but come on, as big as your wedding?
Why would a charity give away a free boat?!
Oh, I beg to differ. The Pictionary incident?
I know. Ross still sees his pediatrician!!! I don't care!
Oh yeah, we were but umm, now we've got candy.
But I saved it. I put my basket on top.
Oh, well, it pretty much sucked. How was yours?
Hey! Those are all the things I'm responsible for!
Yeah, uh you-you probably need that for stamps, right?
Yeah that's right! Come on Joey; sex me up!
Hey-whoa, slow down. No, keep moving. Wow!
Yes, you did! And don't you say, "No, I didn't!"
Oh wow, you didn't even try to unhook my bra!
Okay. Phoebe, I-I think Ross is right. What are we gonna do?
Well how can that be, you were just kissing Sabrina?
Okay. So, can I serve you a little of-What? What? What?
Oh thank you so much Mr. Kaplan, thank you so much.
Monica, what is with you? Who'd you have lunch with?
Seriously stop it, or I'm gonna jump on ya.
Phoebe, how would you do this to me? This was all your idea.
So hot I cried myself to sleep last night.
And fifty. So it was like one and fifty dollars.
Ohh, God, I just got so nervous that he would say no.
Ohh, I'm gonna miss that big old squishy butt.
Joey, what are you talking about? You're a terrific actor.
Hey uhm, do you remember that one really great time...?
Ooh, I was kinda hoping that wouldn't be an issue...
It's just so frustrating! Why doesn't she want my breast?!
NO! Or, cut!You know, that's your call!
She's steaming her dress, why? What's up?
Come on. How can I just tell him? What about Julie?
Did they mention that I'm rubber and you're glue?
Well, it was a little extravagant, but I a pretty good deal.
What? C'mon you guys, I don't care, I have a date tonight.
What do you mean? You've been in my room before!
Yah! She's... uhm... not very good though...
Oh wow! That deserves another piece of candy.
..so, he said it was just a sprain, and that was it.
All right, cut, let's pick again, pick again.
Ugh, okay, well somebody will come and save us.
So, which of these babies do you think is the ugliest?
Um, Pheebs, so, you guys just dont get along?
No-no, seriously-seriously, what was the especially me part about?
Ohh, there's a picture of her in the yearbook actually.
You really think I didn't say goodbye to you because I don't care?
Because you took three hundred bottles of shampoo?
Well since I'm movin' out and-and you're so beautiful...
Do you have anything that would... get us out of them?
What?! Joey got a turkey stuck on his head?!
Oh yeah? Another night of birdogging the chickas?
That is not true. She did! She forced me!
I mean we're not, we're not gonna live together anymore?
Go-go-go-go, come on! So uh, what did you find out?
Oh, thank God I can't hear a word that you're saying!
Joey! The wedding is in less than an hour!
Well... he happens to be a very nice... guy....
Well, maybe the next batch, we could all get some.
And yet she was worth jeopardising our relationship!!
What a jerk! You want me to kick his ass?
Oh my God! That's the creepiest thing I've ever heard!
"Indeed there isn't"... I should really get back to work.
Umm, I'm sorry. Do you-do you have a problem with me?
How's Ross doing? Y'know since all the Emily stuff.
Well, why do y'know go in that room and do your homework?
I cannot believe that you didn't tell me that we are still married!!
You wanna go in the bedroom? It's a little more comfortable.
You were supposed to be in there so I could see your thing!
My God. Okay. Ha-ha-ha beat ya! Sucker!
Hello. I need to get on the 11 o'clock flight.
Ross! Y'know what, I just got-why? Why did you do this?!
But! Don't you have to give him his money back?
So uh...I guess we should...make it official huh?
Well, I have been spending a lot of time in the lab.
Ohhh, this is the least jealous I've ever been!
I can do that. I certainly did it when we were going out.
We went through a lot of wine tonight, you guys.
Yes, Chandler, that's exactly what it is. It's your hair.
Joey... are you sure? I mean, I know how much you love him!
Oh, wait before you guys go, can I just ask you a question?
Oh, lucky me! Coffee and a live sex show!
Yeah, yeah, I was just about to take a break anyways, so...
Oh... you're not gonna do a magic trick, are ya?
You know what we should all do? Go see a musical.
Y'know, I don't-I don't know. Let me, let me check.
Hey! Oh my God you're here, let me see your hand!!
No, you guys, you really don't have to go, we're done talking.
Ross, thank you. Hey, do you guys wanna go see a movie?
Oh. Look at you making up crap for me. Oh God!
Oh my God! It's Joey Tribbiani of Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.!!!!!!!
Ooh, this is soo sweet, Joey our little twinkle-toes.
Oh God, oh, and then she told the funniest story...
Okay. Okay. Okay. Uh, what do I, what do I do with him?
Okay. Hey, what are you thinking? What are you thinking right now?
Your company has a fine foods division?
Yeah, that was an awesome day! Opening credits.
Well honey, then why don't you break up with one of them?
Shh.. Go back to sleep. I have to go home.
Oh God! Thank God you're home! I'm watching Cujo.
Ok, look, Ross. I do not want Emma going to the playground.
I accidentally packed these with my stuff. Who is this?
Why? Seriously I did not understand a word that you said.
Oh, great could you make me four copies of those?
Oh, I really liked him. Yeah, it was really, really, really good.
Okay honey, now I'm gonna try to listen from right here!
Excuse us for a minute. You didn't tell her to come?!
I... Am I the only one that this is embarrassing for?
Oh y'know what honey? Let's not talk about that right now?
Yeah... Yeah, we can wait, we don't have to do anything tonight.
All right, well that's good to know. Good night, Steve.
Uh-huh, doing it. Doing it. Phone doing it.
Well then you just must have a natural talent for it.
Oh honey thank God you're home, I was getting worried.
Uh, Mon, you-you gonna leave your shoes out here?
All right, you're the boss. I guess I gotta do what you tell me.
Oh wait, Ross, would you just stay and help me get dressed?
What? Wait a minute, I didn't pay, I thought you paid!
Oh hi, Mr. Wineburg, hi Mrs. Wineburg.
But ah, you're safe from it if it's in the freezer?
Okay fine, I did. But I didn't see anything, I swear.
Yeah, I-I-I-I'm funny Ben, but I'm not stupid. Okay?
Well, we were going to do that after-I mean umm, next.
Ooh, your lips are so soft... Do that again...
Y'know what? I don't, I don't think Phoebe really wants to come.
Jean-Claude she said yes, I'll see you tonight. Thank you.
Please tell me you're not gonna dress up like a dinosaur.
Yeah, looks that way. First ones here! Wooo!!
Oh thank you, Chandler, this is so great, she's gonna love me.
I'm not saying that I'm a lesbian! I'm just saying that this happened!
I was just asking 'cause I need someone to watch Emma tonight.
Hi! Okay, don't be mad at me, but I couldn't resist.
Chandler, aren't you worried about what to get Monica for Christmas?
No, I'm sorry, we're all out of those. Anybody else?
No, no, no, I admire a man who can cry.
OK, Ross, listen to me, I am not yours to save.
They took Ben to the park. Where've you been?
No. She's going to live with us for eight weeks.
That is hard to say, Ross. That is hard to say.
I don't know! I'm-I'm kinda thinking it-it was the lobster...
Well that sounds kinda cool, kinda like The Hobbit.
Look, Chandler, he has moved on, OK, you have to too.
So does it really hurt as bad as they say?
It'll never last, he's just a rebound roommate.
There's not gonna be a wedding. Ross and I are not getting married.
You know, this happens all the time to my computer at work.
Thank you doctor. Oh thank you for being so nice and calm.
Ross, hey you know what might make it less boring?
Ya know, in crazy world, that means you're married.
Yeah. Oh! Was how you invented the cotton gin?!
Oh, little 'X's! Great! That makes up for everything!
Oh, oh, oh, I'll get 'Rainy Day Bear'!!
Whatever happened to just singing for no reason? Huh?
Okay. . Hello Drake, I'm surprised to see you here.
Well, I'm gonna take a nap, turkey makes me sleepy.
Yeah well, Ross just made plans for the whole century.
No, I haven't had a chance to be alone with him yet.
Oh sorry, hold on. Let me just check on the baby!
Oh, I guess. Except everything looks like jammies now.
Honey, I'm sorry, but he's right. I love you, but you're crazy.
Ross, seriously! You've gotta go to an appropriate doctor.
Yeah! It's weird. But the thing is need to find a date.
I know. Days of Our Lives, thank you very much.
Yeah, and-and you better make sure he tips you this time.
Oh, no, no, I don't have one. I just need to talk to my friend.
Oh thank you! Thank you, thank you, thank you! Emily?
OK, OK. So, you ever get a pet with a girlfriend?
And y'know what else, oh my God, are they gonna love you.
No, no, not at the moment, no, I'm not. Are you?
I am so gonna miss watching you freak people out like that!
Monica, you should totally put your name down on the list
No that's just--That's just 'cause I'm such a good messer!
Oh, it's so sad they never had a chance to meet.
Oo, I can't watch this, it's like Sophie's Choice.
Okay, uhh, I think I'm going to run to the ladies room.
Ooh, and it's so nice having this little sink here...
Huh-huh, no act--no, uhh, that, that is basil.
I knew it! I knew it. Come on tell me your moves.
You just don't look old enough to have a twenty-year-old daughter.
It's not a miracle Joey! I'm sure there's some explanation.
Great, people having sex, that's just what I need to see.
Okay, in about ten seconds you're gonna see him kiss me.
So, what, you're just, you're just okay with being flaky?
Hey! Ross, listen can you come to a charity event tonight?
I knew that! I knew that! I was just messin' with you too!
Oh, thank you that's very helpful, I'm glad you came over.
Uh-hmm, uh-hmm, yeah, yeah, I really liked your hands.
Oh yeah, what department was that? The Jerk department?
Oh, big glamour night. Me and Monica at Laundorama.
Wait, we won't know that until we do it, will we?
Honey, stop it! I am not going to tell you until I tell him.
Alright, fine, you go ahead and you do that, alright Ross.
You don't understand! You didn't see how brazen she was.
Phoebe you can't have both of them! You have to pick one!
Okay. Hey. Umm. Does everybody hate these shoes?
And sorta just put the receipt back in your pocket?
I'm sorry, I was just thinking you're day could still pick up.
I am not gonna get fired, because I'm not gonna act on it.
Yes, but you can not tell Ross 'cause I want to surprise him.
I'm not telling you what to do! I am telling you what not to do!
Where am I gonna get a cowgirl outfit on Thanksgiving?
Oh, wow! Congratulations, that's quite a waste of time.
Okay, you look in the kitchen, I will look in the back closet.
No, actually I took it off then I drew it back on.
On someone's lips? Where'd you get the hickey?
That's easy for you to say, you weren't almost just killed.
Oh! Oh, I just thought of the greatest wedding gift to get you.
Well, in my defense, you were not supposed to tell each other.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, quit making up rules!
All right, well, everybody just remember where they were sitting.
I don't know... I mean, I've never looked at you that way before.
Oh, yes! We'll have ourselves a little baby Ruth...
Oh yeah well, you know me, babies, responsibilities, ahhh!!!
Because you are my sister and Ross and I have this huge history...
So did I. I'm really glad Monica asked us out.
But mom, I really know what I'm doing. I can handle this.
And the ring, was the size of my fist !
God. I have never been so uncomfortable in my entire life!
Thank you. OK. Machine. Just waiting for the beep.
Phoebe, it's me. I'm going to hunt you down and kill you!
Oh, sure! Do you need me to train somebody new?
Yeah and you had fun teaching him how to be all Joey.
Yeah, it is! But you're just a kid! I mean you're 25!
Okay, see now I'm scared because I don't actually think you're kidding.
Huh. Wow, I wouldn't think Hobbs would like that so much.
So how is the uhm... baby styling business going?
Oh, no, no, no. Presents first. Food later.
Or. We could put a hat on his head.
I am not horsing around okay? I am Porsching around.
I am soo not going to do good on my SATs tomorrow.
Oh! Really? Do you wanna try some of them on for me?
Well, the first time didn't really count... I mean, y'know, 's'Barry.
Wow, everything looks so good! I think I'm gonna have the chicken.
Yes, my sister's giving us her place for the weekend.
Please! We did not fog Danny! Who's Danny?
Oh it's umm, it's tofu cake. Do you want some?
It is our first official date. Our first date.
You, you, you said he liked me. You, you slowpokes!
Hi. Umm, I think there's something that we really need to talk about.
Y'know what, you are mean boys, who are just being mean!
So you'll definitely get onstage, even if you don't win.
Yeah, all right. All right! Just keep walkin'! All right?
Just when you thought that dude couldn't get any wierder.
Wow. Well, I guess it was Cupid who brought her here.
Oh, wait, Joshua! Joshua! Yeah, well, that oughta do it.
Well, I'll be waiting for you, just come up when you're done.
Joey, would you just come out here and stop being such a baby!
Ahhhh , you brought rats to my birthday party?
Pheebs, if I had never met him this never would have happened!
Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing?
All right Monica, do you want to know why I was with Ross tonight?!
Uh...no. No, no, in fact, you're not having a boy.
Oh, Phoebe, I'm sorry! Phoebe has prepared something as well.
Maybe it was just the kind of story where you have to be there.
Oh, really, really? Well, it wasn't very good for me either.
I could, I could but I don't want to! I want to kiss Joey!
I'm so not impressed. Everybody snacks when they shop.
Thank you. Oh Joey and look at this crib! It's so cute!
Chandler, what are you doing? There is a trash can right there.
Honey, we have to go. Our reservations are at 8:00.
You're so sweet. Oh my God! And you gave the baby Hugsy!
Oh great! Suddenly she sounds like a biblical whore.
You walked around all night in the city by yourself?
Would you excuse me, please? I'm trying to have a date here.
I'm sorry, this sounds like something I'm never gonna be interested in.
Aahh, I'm a... chef at a restaurant uptown.
Tommy's supposed to be here soon, we're going to lunch.
Oh, OH! Wow, I love those! Where did you get them?
Yeah, I'm not so sure you should be here when he comes up.
She's actually very sweet and we used to be very close.
Joey, why don't you just tell her what happened? It's not your fault.
Hi. What are you doing here? Isn't this against the rules?
Well, I gotta get up early and it's almost seven o'clock.
Well, last night you seemed to know your way around the table.
Wait no, honey, honey throw it to me, throw it to me.
Look Ross, if you're so freaked out, just get in the car!
Ross, you got that for free from the museum gift shop.
Well, I'm sorry I went out with him when I knew you liked him.
I'm sorry honey, I'm just having a, having a rough day.
Yes! I'd love to! Have her come by the office.
Well, so, now, do you guys have a lot of big plans?
Oh, not as a friend, Phoebe!! Fine, I won't use it!
Ross, I am telling you that she is using you to get back at me!
Wait a minute! What do you mean, you're taking over my job?
Oh, Joey, you know what, no-one is gonna be able to tell.
Maybe. But just a little one. Phoebe got the whole world.
Well, then, you know, couldn't she have just copied my haircut?
Okay, well, that's one less thing we have to do on Monday.
You can't just say, 'Nice to meet you, good night?'
Well, sure! Come in! Well, what-what happened to your girlfriend?
I know. At dusk. That's such a hard time for me.
Oh yeah? Startin' to feel her again there are we?
Umm, well let's see uh, this one is Tom Brokaw.
Oh. Do you want to watch the rest of the movie with me?
Okay, all right, give me the mug! I'll keep the mug.
Well, hon-ey. I'm just trying to look nice for your big night.
Oh god, waddawe do, waddawe do, waddawe do?
She's ok, I just don't get a really good vibe from her!
No Ross! Ross! Ross! My child has no father!
Yeah, y'know what? Don't look at it. Seriously, don't look at it.
Yeah, and you know what? You're right, I do feel better, thank you Ross.
Well, I like the pretty little drawing of you in the wedding dress.
Oh my god, I can't believe you let me put this in my mouth.
Joey! It is an auction! You don't guess, you buy!
Well, no. That's impossible. You can never be too Alan.
Is there room on that step for a pathetic loser?
Oh, hi Mrs. Lynch! Is Joanna in already?
No, he said we were holding up the people behind us.
I didn't see anything! I actually changed my mind about the name.
Ohh, I just don't think I have enough left on my credit card.
All right. Well, if I gonna do this, I'd better keep going.
Yeah, they were very y'know...wrestley. But, I guess that's normal?
Hey-hey, now he's showing us his poking device.
Phoebe, your in pain, would you just go to the dentist, just go.
Ugh, horrible! I did the stupidest, most embarrassing thing!
So that there will be a decent place for me to sit.
That's great, great. So do you have any questions for us?
From the guy in the bar, why didn't I get that message?
I was faking it! Can't you tell when I'm being fake?
Um, excuse me Gavin, I have a question I need to ask you.
My boss, Joanna? Wow, that must've been awkward.
Oh my God! Oh my God! I can't go! I'm gonna be too nervous!
We're waiting for you to open the door. You got the keys.
In case you didn't notice, that is a scary man.
: Step away from the crib, I have a weapon!
Now! Give him the sandwich! Give him the sandwich!
All right, first name on the speed dial is mom.
Monica, nothing has even happened yet, and you're already so...
You know, I'm thinking about letting Emma have her first cookie.
Well first, for forgetting to throw you a bridal shower.
What?! You-you actually thought that basket was gonna get you the apartment?
Oh, Ross, c'mon. It's my fault, I almost lost your...
Well, I told him I would think about it, but I'm gonna tell him no.
So I'll bring her by around seven? Is that okay?
No, these aren't all my suitcases. This one's Paolo's.
No honey, we're sorry, we didn't mean it. I love you. I love you.
I'm so sorry! No I'm sorry! No I'm sorry! No I'm sorry!
I'm not gonna gooo, so I think that will accomplish the not going.
Joey stop staring! There's nothing there! It's not true!
I-I am not uptight-Hey-hey-hey-oh-oh! Listen, I am not uptight, man.
No, no, thats OK. Y'know, I think I'm gonna give it a go.
Hey! How's it going? Did you make any new friends?
C'mon, you guys, what're we gonna do, what're we gonna do?
well watching sharks? Are you sure that's what he was doing?
I'm not! This is what I'm doing now. I've got this job-
Well, isn't that a good thing? You said you were sick of this.
What? What do you mean, "there you are"? Where was she?
Noo! Oh God we did-we didn't, we didn't uhh...
I know, I just didn't want to wear my glasses on my first date.
So forcing her to marry Bobby is gonna make that happen?
Oh it's OK. You were worth the wait, and I don't just mean tonight.
Oh yeah, Joey broke it. Had to get rid of it.
oh oh! What is up with Miss Hawaiian Tropic?
Oh, that would be great! I love him, I love him, I love him...
I'm sorry, too! OH GOD! I shouldn't have said anything!
Well, I used to date him, but you're still going out with her!
Yeah. I'm gonna have a baby. I'm gonna have a baby. I'm gonna have a baby!
Ooh! My Chinese food! Let me get my cash!
Really?! Got a little crush on Tag there do ya?
Eavesdropping. Pheebs, the ceiling tiles were falling down.
So uh, heard you had some fun with Tag last night.
Oh my God Ross! What in heaven's name are you doing here?
Look! This is ridiculous. We should be packing you!!
God, oh God Monica, I forgot. This is our first date.
Awww, no, it's okay, we've actually known for a while.
Oh God. Oh I can't believe Joey Tribbiani heard me throw up!
I would love to live with you Ross; that's-that's great! Thank you!
Hi, I'm sorry, I need to borrow your phone for just one minute.
And while I'm gone don't you boys sneak a taste.
So umm, you're gonna stay with me as long as I need you?
OK, you wanna play? OK, let's play, let's play.
Wait, you can't go away this weekend! It's Emma's birthday!
You had to do it, didn't you? You couldn't just leave it alone.
Joey, do you have peanut butter on the back of your head?
See Pheebs, I promised you no one would die, didn't I?
Honey, you can say it, Poconos, Poconos, it's like Poc-o-nos
All right I know, I know how it looks Pheebs, but I'm telling you...
Wow, a Swedish massage from a real Swedish person.
So did they call you to tell you your name's gonna be in this?
Oh but Joey, I have to go. There's no room for a baby here.
And I hope Barry doesn't kill you and eat you in Aruba.
I'm gonna throw this away, but thank you so much for the gesture!
No. No, she told me his name was Ken Adams.
Well guys tend to get naked before they're gonna have sex.
Okay, walk us through it, honey, walk us through it.
Joey, I think everyone saw the wine come out of your nose.
Maybe Joey's right. Maybe all good deeds are selfish.
Yes, you have to get her something, and it should be something really nice.
No, the other thing. I really think it's great they work things out.
Shoot, shoot, this is never gonna work! He's right there!
Oh, no, no! I heard you before, that is so not what this is!
How does going to a strip club help him better?
Uh- which one of us are you talking to there, Barr?
Oh, y'know what? I can't. I have to have dinner with that Melissa girl.
Fine. Hi! Yes, I'd like to order a large pizza.
What?! Joey, you don't want to go on a date with a pregnant lady.
Wow. Wow, that's great. Great. Ok, wow, you know what.
Hey! Have you guys seen Jill? I can't find her anywhere.
I just, Phoebe, said y'know thought she saw something between you guys.
No Phoebe, I am not letting you put makeup on my baby!
Anyway sweetie, I am, I'm so sorry I ruined your night.
You give me back my sweater or it's handbag marinara.
Yeah? Wow! Y'know, that this thing has speakers in the headrest!
What are you? Monica!! Stop it!! Oh my God! Stop it!
Noo, that's our unbelievably loud upstairs neighbor.
Why would you even want to come Ross? You're a horrible skier.
Sure, I'll just sit next to the trans-sexual from purchasing.
O-okay, now see, you never ever ever told us that...
Yes, Joanna really has been an incredible mentor to me.
"Well, but I'm not sure I really want to do anything about it."
Well maybe it would make me feel better if I slept with Joey.
Oh! Well let's look for them. Oh-oh-hey! Are these them?
I mean I got news for you mister, Emma? Not easy.
Nothing! Oh God, we're just so excited that you want to get this apartment!
Hey Ross! Check it out! I learned a new trick!
Yeah, but it's okay, because when Ross left Mark came over.
Yeah, I-I heard. I think it's great! Ohh, I'm so happy for you!
Oh-oh, Pottery Barn! You can throw the rest away.
Oh! Well you're just the prettiest ballerina I've ever seen.
I just- I don't think us getting back together is a good idea.
Okay. Okay, that's him! That's him! That's Cujo! That's Cujo!
And do you remember going into my purse and stealing the phone?!
Hi. Tag, I have a conference call today is that correct?
Alright, just put your hands out and I'll back up into them.
Am I the only one who doesn't think that she's hot? Ross?
Awww, stop. Come on. Now go shave that head!
Ok, I just, I just really need to be with myself right now. I'm sorry.
Y'know you're-you're probably wondering about the old date on there.
Look, Ross, he's just... Sandy is just sensitive, that's all.
I don't care! The wires have come loose in your head!
Dad, dad. We got it!! We Got It!!!
Oh my God, its happening. It's already started. I'm Kip.
Hi! Thanks, hey so uh what'd you do last night?
Okay. Oh wait! Umm, did you send those contracts to Milan?
It's my father. He wants to give me a Mercedes convertible.
I mean why, of all people would you want to go out with Chip?!
Oh my God! I can't believe you guys are actually think you're moving in here!
Oh my God! It sure didn't look this way when I lived here.
Oh...see... but Joanne loved Chachi! That's the difference!
Shhhhh! Phoebe! All right, look. I have a little thing for him.
Oh, oh my God! I can practically hear the mahjong tiles!
Oooooh. : Oh! I got an interview! I got an interview!
Oh, umm, okay, yeah, I'll be, yeah I'll be right back.
Oh my God! Was she old? Does she have a view?
Assistant buyer. Oh! I would be shopping... for a living!
I will not! I'm the divisional head of men's sportswear!
Ok. Oh God. Get the camera, it's in the diaper bag.
Oh, ok, thank you. Do you see what all the guys see in her?
Joey! Why did we have to rush out of there so fast?!
Yeah, I don't know who I was kidding. I can barely use chopsticks.
G.I. Joe? Do you really think he's gonna fall for that?
Well, I have to say that earns tutu pieces of candy.
Which you're not, because you've totally hung up on him!
Well, y'know, if-if kids like to play with Capri pants.
Yeah, well just be glad he's not playing a smaller instrument.
What...? Too sensitive to take care of our baby?
Ohh, it's me and La Poo! Wow! I miss that dog.
Oh wait, don't you have to pay for your, Busty Ladies?
Great! It went great. Really great. Hey, is that wine?
Well, y'know, possibly. You didn't tell him that, though? Right?
Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no, that's OK, I don't need them. I'm going for fours.
He's downstairs getting the rest of the stuff out of the cab.
Okay, it's not Relaxi Cab. It's Relaxicab, like taxicab.
Hey, that is the...baby's problem. Oh, everything okay with the waiter?
Oh yeah! Y'know, if it's not a headboard, it's just not worth it.
Ooh... oooh... oh, ah... Can I ask you a question?
After our date last night, did you feel a little weird?
He was a hamster! I am not going to vacuum up my baby!
I mean n-not-not fake at all like most famous people.
Pie in the hood, pie in the hood. Go.
Oh wait, no-no-no! Drag me down. Drag-drag me down.
Just so you know... With us... it's never off the table.
Paul. Umm, I just wanted you to know that Ross really is a great guy.
Thank you Joey. You know what? I'm not even sure I can have caffeine.
Ok, good-bye you guys. Thanks for everything. Oh, sorry! Oh, sorry!
Uh, it's from yore. Like the days of yore. Y'know?
Of course they're listening to you! Everybody listens to you.
Horrible and degrading list of reasons not to be with me?
Look, um, I think we should talk about what happened on the terrace.
Hi, uh, nothing. That horrible woman just took my machine.
Maybe. I-I don't know-Oh God, how could I be so stupid?!
Monica look! Look-look-look! Here is that table that I ordered.
Ross! Phoebe's gonna be here any second, she cannot see this!
Yeah, yeah... It's... "climax your way to better skin".
Careful, watch her hair. WATCH HER HAIR!
Oh, Chandler!! All right, this is it! You never see Joanna again!
He-he said Rachel, right? Do you think I should go up there?
I'll take a coffee. So how was your big date last night?
Okay, do you see, do you see what you're keeping me married too?!
Oh as, as opposed to your other multi-functional nipples?
Umm, or, maybe, I should stay away from all men.
Yeah! Right! Okay, I'll see you guys later. Woo hoo!
Okay uh, but before you do that. I-I, I need you to talk to me.
You are not. You have never been able to break up with her.
Aaah... Ross, actually there's something that I really need to talk to you about.
Nothing else worked. That girl is all about the ass...
Yeah! You can hook it up to your TV and you get radio!
Oh Joey! Joey! No, it's not you! You didn't get anybody pregnant!
Show cat! Quality show cat! Show cat!
No, it was a stupid bet! We were just playing a game!
Hey, do you believe this? Do you believe they are actually getting married?
No! There's no orange juice in there! We win!!
Every day, you are becoming more and more like your mother.
Wow! Umm, y'know, I-I would really love to, but I-I shouldn't.
Oh, I can't believe I ever let him touch me with those fingers.
Well, have you been involved with someone where you haven't broken up?
Joey. Joey, something feels weird and not good weird. I don't-Whoa!!
Wow! They really got you guys. Your T.V. The chairs.
Basically, there's the thing, and then there's the stuff after the thing.
Yes! She's gonna help us take care of the baby! Woo-hoo.
Hi! Ok, you're ready to go pick up Phoebe and go shopping?
You mean the mom you met in Montauk. She was a cat?!
I know. I'm sorry. Look, I'll make a deal with you all right? Okay?
No!! No! He's not married, or involved, with anyone!
Well, for starters I would've said the right name at my wedding!
Oh God, she mu... she must need her diaper changed.
Ralph Lauren called again and they offered me more money.
Okay, Pheebs, you look in the kitchen, I will look in the back closet.
I ah, will buy and wrap all of your Christmas gifts.
Oh God... Okay. Alright. Alright. Okay. Ross, please don't hate me.
Monica, your Sweet Sixteen was like a million years ago.
I've just been thinking about how my baby and I are gonna be all alone.
Oh God! This is silly, I'm gonna see you in a couple of hours!
Yeah, because I was mad at you, not because I stopped loving you!
I woke up today with the biggest smile on my face.
Oh! Oh, I think I'm gonna throw up a little bit. What did you say?
Yeah. It was after the party, we were on the balcony and...
This is easy...Can't do this! Oh! Wow! Seriously I can't do this.
Oh, god, I can't believe one of us actually has one of these.
Oh thank you. Hey y'know, I'm so sorry to hear about you and Elizabeth.
Oh, come on! You think that's gonna work on me?! I invented that!
Hello?! Oh, yeah! This is gonna be a while. Excuse me. Yeah!
Oh really?! Then how come all your stuff is in this box?!
Now, if you will excuse me I am going to go and lie down.
All right, well the place was closed. I'll just copy it later.
Uh, no she doesn't but I can, I can get a message to her.
No. No, I don't. Could you be a dear and go tell him?
Really?! You think so? Y'know, I had just rolled out of bed.
December 26th, huh maybe she's Santa Clause.
No? So you're saying that if I called it, it wouldn't ring?
Well wait a minute, what happened to Days of Our Lives?
Yeah, maybe if you gave this girl a chance it would go somewhere.
That went well. Almost everybody knew that she was a girl.
Well, the cat... the cat turned out to be Paolo's cat!
Oh, I so wanted Ross to know first, but I'm so relieved you guys know.
Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh Chandler!! You guys are gonna be so happy!
Oh, it's a gift certificate to this new SPA in SOHO.
Oops. Sorry! Well, good thing you number all of them, huh?
Yeah it's umm... Yeah it's uh... It-it's y'know-It's nothing.
Vogue! Hey, so tell me about this Jane Eyre woman.
So. I mean, who here does not have the time to get to know Julie?
Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me, excuse me, sorry. Hi.
Bye bye Mike!/Cya mike!/Bye mike!/Bye bye now!
Oh, well, actually we were just talking about me not going to Ross's wedding.
Oh Daddy, no he didn't mean anything by that, he really didn't.
I'm sorry, they were just all coming at me, and I didn't know what to do.
Oh, hey! Hi, there you are, I've been looking for you everywhere!
Yeah it is, it is. We really, really have to do something about that.
Joey, y'know that you could just not throw the sticks up in the air.
Ahh, I don't believe you. I think you don't want them to see you begging me.
Oh, I'm sorry, were you speaking to me or sleeping with someone else?
I lied! And I'm not sick! Just stay behind the curtain!
Did we speak on the phone last night? Did you call me?
Oh, that is so sweet. I think I'm falling in love with you all over again.
Ross, it took you ten years to finally admit you liked me.
He's got this thing. And I keep telling him to go to my chiropractor...
Central Perk is proud to present Miss Phoebe Buffay.
No, no, no, no turtles scare me. I don't need that today.
You are. Well, um... We, we, we were just... Wow!
So uh, apparently people are familiar with the Europe story?
I see your fifty cents... and I raise you... five dollars.
I know but they're just so beautiful! Oh, my God, I just pulled one out.
Kind of ditzy? Too into her looks? Spoiled?
What, as part of your poor friends outreach program?
Pam! Oh God okay, just imagine this, "The Pam."
Hey! Everybody hide! Hide! I saw her! She's coming!
That's fine. So Monica, you are now in control of my love life.
Wow, that's great Ross, I'm sorry we weren't more supportive before.
Oh, well, she's asleep now. Stop forcing that thing on her.
How-how did end up in Vermont with that awful witch?!
...I just don't know if the world is ready for you and your bag.
Sure. I guess. Hey, I hear you don't have to go to London. Yay!
Oh, I probably shouldn't-so I will! Oh! Wow! It's like it's raining!
Don't let him in! I'm supposed to be at a regatta gala.
Yes, you do. When we left, you said, "got the keys."
Oooh... ***I really can't hear what she says*** come here.
No because first they arrest the guy and then they try him.
Hi! Well, we were just about to take off and see a movie. Oh no!
Yeah, sure. All right, whose court is the ball in now?
'Gone for more jars. Back later. Monica Geller.'
I was giving you an appology and you were totally checking her out!
Oh yeah! Oh my God! That is our friend! It's Naked Ross!
Oh no-no-no-no-no, no, no! We, you with someone and me with someone.
Well, I don't get it, but she wanted me to give you her phone number.
Ohh wow! I'm sorry, but Ross you kicked off your shoes!
Sorry, I just uhm... I can't seem to get Ross out of my head...
Oh my God, I'm starting to look like my great aunt, Muriel.
Oh my God, Melissa Warburton. I don't think I have the energy for this.
Well umm, maybe we could uhh... Ah-ha! Too slow!!
I don't care that you left. I'm just glad that you're here. Thanks you guys!
Oh, well, I...It's kind of weird talking to you about this, but...
Guys! Guess what, guess what, guess what, guess what!
Ohh, out, oh God, I don't know why we didn't think to check there!
Yeah, 'cause that's why you won't get Isabella Rosselini, geography.
Why do you care about the guy who won the Paris trip?
I know, that old lady at the end was ready to take you home.
No. Not-not for me, but why don't you take off your sweater?
Wait-wait-wait, I just thought of another story about how nice Ross is!
Yeah! Ohh, I've been waitin' so long to get on that body!
Oh my God, Oh my God, here comes Ross. He's gonna flip out.
Well you uh, you were always really good at the uh, at the uh the stuff.
Come on! Serious-ser-ser-seriously, what did she mean by that? Especially you!
I don't know, I don't know. Urrrgh! Look, maybe we should take a break.
Hi, my name is Rachel Green, I have an appointment for Emma.
All right fine! You're not invited to the party we're gonna have either.
Ohh, thank you for my beautiul earrings, they're perfect. I love you.
Oh no, it's still nap time. But she'll be up soon.
How did we end up with these jerks? We're good people!
So uh, Pheebs, honey, how are those mood swings coming?
Wow! It looks like the Easter Bunny's funeral in here.
Oh, I win! He's got Barney's on his speed dial.
I'm having dinner with my dad tomorrow night, do you wanna come?
Listen, y'know what? I was really freaked out too when I found out...
No! Come on its late, we're not gonna go down to the office.
Ohh-ho-hooohhh. The hair comes out, and the gloves come on.
Oh God. You did. You heard. Ok, listen, let me explain.
Hey, did you guys check out those new hand-dryers in the bathroom?
Okay-okay-okay! So, making things. That sounds like so much fun.
Well, y'know he lost his keys so he was looking for them...
Nothing... It's really... It's nothing... Come here, come here...
Yes, his name is Barry, he's a doctor, thank you very much.
Fancy soap? I thought we were savin' that for the Pope!
Oh hey Ross... Listen, I heard about you and Charlie. I'm really sorry.
No, no, no.... the, um, the... 'love' part?
So ah, did you have fun at the bachelor party last night?
No, it was on the house, it was, it was a newlywed special.
I mean do you have any fun, you know, fantasy type things?
Okay honey, you do realize she only spins like that on ice.
Wow, Monica, you look just like your grandmother. How old was she there?
Wow, this is a tough one. I think I'm gonna have to go with the dog.
Monica, why? Why would I ever want to take away from your night?
Oh yeah. I used to babysit him. Hey, how's his dad?
Ross honey, this is very nice, but, but I-I got a crisis.
Well in High School, that added up to head cheerleader.
Well hello! Welcome to Monica's. May I take your coat?
Ok, I've got one. Wow, those things almost never come true.
Oh! I'm sorry! Are we having an 89-year-old? How about Dayton?
Umm, I think there was a restaurant... I know there was wine. . .
Shhh don't say that loud, Gunther's gonna want to hug me.
Y'know, I gotta tell ya, I just loved your look when you were bald.
Oh look who it is, my husband. The apple of my eye.
Coming! Try under the bed, try under the bed!
Oh does it matter?! All that matters is that you look so handsome.
Well, believe me, it's been a long time since I've been flung.
Joey, is what she just said umm-Oh my God. You were actually gonna...
All right, fine! But I had too! I had to do it for my career!
Umm, when were you gonna tell me that you're going out with Chip Matthews?
But it was beautiful. I mean it was small, but kind of spectacular.
Oh my God, what a great surprise! This is such a beautiful house.
All right, I gotta go to bed. Honey, I had such a wonderful time.
Take 'em! Joey, you can touch them! They're your underwear.
No! Shoot, Dr. Schiff what kind of question is that?!
No, but I was doing my thing and everything was going according to the plan!
What? It's true, my right leg is two inches shorter.
Excuse me! But this is a purebred, show-quality Sphinx cat!
Yes! And he said really mean things that were only partly true.
Ok, that's it! Just give'em to me! I'll split them up!
You may need to use this year to teach Ben about Phoebe.
All right. ALL RIGHT! I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna go to Paris.
Yeah, remember that thing I told you that happened yesterday? Well it didn't happen.
Hi. Well hey, you don't - you don't think they're kind of cool?
Ok well, I heard that! Which means that she heard it too!
Of course! Oh Joey, this ring I...it's beautiful I love it!
Well it's hard to tell... Oh God, if she would just stop moving.
Oh it was perfect! I mean it really felt like he was my friend again.
Yeah, right, he almost danced me right down that...garbage chute.
No, come on, that is a lie. We also kissed in Barbados.
Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. See Phoebe, Phoebe.
Joey, I'm really sorry that I lied to you. I was just trying to make things...
Uh, I don't know. Why don't you put it right here next to my water?
Well, you ripped the paper out of the court reporter's machine!!
Uh-hmm. I'm just thinking about Phoebe; poor knocked up Phoebe.
Oh, what do you, you want me to stop seeing him, is that what you want?
And with Chandler in the next room. What are you, what are you sick?
Ohh! Yeah! Yeah that-that would've been a much simpler problem.
Oh that's right! I'm sorry! I-I am early! Finish! Please!!
What? He said 'we should do it again', that's good, right?
"Dear Rach, you're a great person. Sorry about your tiney-wienie."
Oh wow, uh okay, uh maybe. Umm, yes, I can do that!
Oh my God!! Do it!! Honey, you've waited long enough!!
Y'know, I gotta tell ya, this really does put in a better mood.
Okay, that doesn't help me, because we went to the same high school.
Oh, come on! This is crazy! Can't we just flip a coin?!
No, no, no, wait! Okay, okay. Don't! I'll go, I'll go!
Well, it's a long story, but umm I broke Joey's chair...
Okay, then y'know what? Help me! I need help! I can't do this!
But Joey the baby is going to be crying, it's going to be loud.
Excuse me, Dr. Bobby happens to be an excellent doctor.
Okay, well that's now the third sign that I should not leave Emma.
Come on apartment! Come on apartment! Oh! I know queen is high!
Please, Ross, you-you got hurt playing badminton with my dad.
Yeah? Well, you should know. You've bought like a billion of 'em.
Oh, great. Although I did sit down where there wasn't a chair.
Pheebs is your grandmother maybe saying that you should live here alone?
Oh, come on! I'll give you ten free Ralph Lauren shirts.
You pierced her ears? How could you do this without telling me?
It's left sweetie, but that's okay sweetie, that's a tough one.
We don't want it-it to be too much, we want it to be subtle.
Ohh, he's married! Ross is married. I can't-I still can't believe it.
Oh, and somebody can get those leather pants she's always wanted!
No-no, they just had a big blowout over what to do with my room.
Well, I-I-I've been on Standby for a flight home for hours.
What?! Me?! What about you and your consummated like bunnies nonsense!
What-what, wait a minute, you don't think that's why he wants me back?
Ok... uh... maybe you're not always going after the wrong girl...
I mean is that woman capable of talking about anything else but sex?
Well then Joey, what the hell were you doing with an engagement ring?!
C'mon, seriously, you guys, you're not going to make me watch this alone!
Ahhh, I think you look great! That bag is gonna get you that part.
Ohh! I would kill for a salmon skin roll right now!
I'm trying to put Emma down for a nap, have you seen Hugsy?
Hey Joey, is this the bed where Olivia lost her virginity?
Phoebe! You picked Joey and Ross?! You can not have two backups!
Yes! Great! Give me those cigs! Give it! Give it!
Ooh, Pheebs, what are you gonna say? Are you gonna tell him who you are?
Well, you're the one who wants to fire him, so you're gonna have to do it.
Okay. All right, that's true! But y'know I just don't embarrass that easily.
Yeah and we'll drop it off downstairs so that we're not tempted.
So that we would have something to talk about! So it wouldn't be awkward!
That would be great! Wait, how long is Denise gone for?
I cannot believe you guys! He was really nice and he left because of you!
No, hey, come on, if he asked you first, that's only fair.
I can't believe I don't get to go to my own prom, this is so harsh.
I'm more than okay, I am really, really happy! Wanna know why?
No, I-I-I-I don't, I actually don't know who I'm talking about! So!
Yes, we are very sorry to tell you this, but you, Phoebe, are flaky.
Joey! Why did you tell Chandler that Monica was getting a boob job?
That was surreal. Okay, what do think? Are you interested at all?
Well, it's embarrassing. People were looking at us like we were crazy.
Well, you might want to tell him it sounds like his wife is gay.
Yeah fun? Great! So uh, so did you guys hit it off?
That was one time, Ross, and they were only like 5 milligrams.
He was right there. He got down on one knee and proposed.
All right! Y'know what? That's it! You wanna do it?! Let's do it!
Oh! That's interesting, since she died seven years ago!!
No, why do we always have to do everything according to your time table?
Oh. Hi. We just found this cat and we're looking for the owner.
Oh. Oh, those little clunky Amish things you think go with everything.
Oh my God! Yes, I would love that, oh, that is soo sweet, Joey.
Anyway, they want to take us out Saturday night! What do you say?
Oh my God! That's my boss. You have to seat us somewhere else.
No need!! Problem solved, we are powering through .
Hey look-look, Phoebe's talking to uh, Cute Coffeehouse Guy.
It's a shame though, I mean, when we did it, it was pretty good.
To Monica and Chandler... and that knocked up girl in Ohio.
That's not her name! I'm sorry, she just doesn't feel like an Isabella.
I feel like we're the only two people in the world. Oops. Sorry.
All right honey, we'd better go if we wanna catch that movie.
Full, dry, on its back, and no loose covers.
Since when, since when do you think I don't wear enough of this?
You know that depends on what it is! I've done a lot of stuff.
Yeah, he thought he broke your chair so he switched the chairs!
Joey, y'know you get any mustard on that bag, you can't return it.
I'm fourth! Look at you with your little maple syrup award!
'Cause I know he's gonna flip out and I hate it when he's angry.
No, it's not that. I got fired today. And I didn't get the other job.
That's your, that's your dad's bedroom. That's your dad's bedroom!
Oh, thank you for doing that. I just can't deal with this just quite yet.
Oh yeah! Actually, that's one of the reasons why we're not a couple.
Just think, in a couple of years we get to turn into them.
Yeah, I guess. I-I... I mean, do-do you think we're ever gonna have that?
Oh well actually gonna use a nanny and uh, I don't even have a housekeeper.
I can see that. You look like you slept with a hanger in your mouth.
No, you're not an idiot, Ross. You're a guy very much in love.
Wow! I definitely did not see that one backfiring! I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
Ross, you have to understand that your nice thing makes us feel this big.
Yeah, at the lecture, I told you that last week, you said you didn't mind.
Oh, that is so hot. She walks around him to the other side)
So, if-if I mess this up, there's nothing else for dessert?
No one! They are my friends, I wouldn't punch any of them.
Uh... Oh, Mindy, you are so stupid. Oh, we are both so stupid.
Okay Ross that's fine, but can you please stand near my head?
So, pretty much around the same time that you started telling this story.
Joey, you can't keep this to yourself, if you know about this, you have to tell him.
Oh yeah. Right. So now, are-do you, do you still do music?
What is my sister doing there?! And why are the drapes shut?!
'Okay. Okay, daddy we'll see you tomorrow night. Okay bye-bye.'
Oh! What a great way to earn some extra pocket money.
Oh, well, that's, that's mighty big of you, Ross. I said don't go!
Yeah! Especially not with all of these knives and cookbooks around...
Ross I-We tried all the spicy food. It's not working.
Hey, you guys! Guess what? Barry and Mindy are getting a divorce!
Y'know, I figure if I can make coffee, there isn't anything I can't do.
Umm, well I would have to say that it's a, it's tragic love story.
You know what, I can't do this. I don't know which one of you guys to pick.
Oh no, I think I'm gonna go home and eat ten candy bars.
And now, y'know, I'm like... I'm like the other woman! I feel so..
I'm not going to sleep with Ralph Lauren. I mean, I could, but I wouldn't.
When you're sick, you do whatever you can to make yourself feel better!
You're lookin' at it upside down-y'know what? It doesn't matter.
I don't know. He was cute, and he liked me. It was an impulse.
Chandler honey, I'm sorry. Ok, can we watch Joey's show now please?
My God, I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I didn't mean to do that! I wouldn't do that!
All right! Ross, do you think it's easy for me to see you with somebody else?
Or...I could call in sick and not deal with it at all...
Okay, so let's play for some pepper! Stop spending my money!
Oh my God you're amazing! Did you just pull that out of her purse?
Hi. Thanks for the party, honey. Should I help you clean up?
Oh, wait and on the nineteenth a secret crush announces itself.
What you got there? Something else that's not yours that you can break?
No! So I can be by myself. Y'know? Have a little alone time.
Ok, Barry's letters. Adam Ritter's boxer shorts.
Okay! I was thinking if it's a girl, how about Sandrine? It's French.
Okay, that sounds fair. It just means that once again we can't...
I mean, it-it was like, it was like he made us into a team.
Yeah, just give me a minute! Oh well, yes, I can think of one good thing.
Why? Just because you're not mature enough to understand something like that?!
Oh y'know what, we don't have to talk about work. We can talk about anything!
We... We are not... ...going to let it... be a problem.
Okay. Yeah, that would be nice actually, to have the apartment to myself for a night.
Look Daddy, it's my life. Well maybe I'll just stay here with Monica.
What's that song? It has been in my head all day long.
Ohhh! Wow! He kinda takes your breath away doesn't he?
I heard it from my friend Irene who heard it from some guy!
Ok actually Mon, Matthew was just giving me his phone number.
She is so cute! You could fit her right in your little pocket!
Well, I feel fine, but I think you're bumming out the rest of the kids.
Oh yeah. Okay, see mom, the truth is I can do this on my own.
Hey! Well, I had to give the kid fifty bucks to stop crying.
I know. I know, but y'know condoms only work like 97% of the time.
How would you feel about taking out my assistant Tag? I'll pay.
Mon. I wish I could, but I've made plans to walk around.
They had to reduce it because of, of my deviated septum.
Oh! Yay! Look! There's a piece that doesn't have floor on it!
I mean maybe you didn't hear about a serious relationship called me and Joshua?
You get away from me!! You sick, sick, sick, sick-o!!
Yeah, they said he's gonna be fine, but he's still heavily sedated.
I mean, you know... Ross and I haven't dated in like... six years...
Ross! I think she is trying to make something happen with you to get back at me!
Oh my God!! You guys have such problems!! I feel so terrible for you!
Yeah, but Mon that's totally different. He was you're health teacher.
So do you uh, think we can get you one of those uh, uniform things?
Ohh, okay. Wh-Ah-ha! Wait a minute. Uh Ben, I can't do it.
Ross!! Oh my--ugh!! You kept count?! You are such a loser!
Come on, please?! I'm boredddd! You let me do it once before.
Oh we did, but my mom got us the greatest gift of all.
Okay, y'know what uh, actually, that's great. That helps a lot. Thanks.
Well, these aren't mine. Maybe Monica used to use them with...
Yes your honor, and here are, are forms, all filled out.
That's all right. I mean hard is it to get a couple drinks right, huh?
I know what this is all about... You've always been jealous of my hair.
Well, why shouldn't I be? I have great friends! I have a wonderful job!
Monica, you don't even have a bed, you sleep in a ball on the floor!
We can't find Chandler...-'s vest. We can't find Chandler's vest.
No, I don't! Ross, I think I'm just a more secure person than you are.
No, not really. I mean you've seen me naked hundreds of times.
It's not kicking right now. Although we would love to see you do that again.
What-Pheebs?! Two dates in one day? That's so unlike you.
What are you talking about Pheebs? I don't... Oh my God, you drew on me?!
Wait a minute. Do you not like all dogs? I mean, not even puppies?
What, so I can't lokk nice? There might be doctors there.
Now, she thinks that I made out with him and I did it to get her job.
Oh, ah nothin'. I just felt like hangin' out here and reading.
She's right. She's right. You are no different than the rest of them.
No. Oh, oh, I guess it would be different if I were- with somebody.
Ah! Well it was Joey reading Drake's lines in the dream...
Well, it was just something Josh said about v-necks, but you had to be there.
Oh Joey, I can't believe you brought my boss into this! I'm gonna get fired!
Well, I think you're forgetting the kinkiest former resident of that room.
Huh. Except, Phoebe's not gonna be the one that gets to dress them.
Hi! You might not remember us, but we are the girls that fogged you.
Well Chandler, what is this very weird, metal A Z thing?
No! No-no, no-no-no, very quiet, said with love, no yelling.
No seriously! Seriously! What has happened to the sanctity of marriage?
Huh... OH MY GOD IT'S BRUSSELS SPROUTS.
I... It just-it took me so long to get that desk organized.
I don't know, I'm sorry, I always slept in the back when we drove up here.
Oh, no no no no. Oh no no no no. I have to do this to her?
So what should we do? Should we start looking for a new place?
Oh! Well, as a single woman, who is available, I think you look great!
Hey, there was one Italian guy, OK, and do you even have a point?
NO but Ross. We are never gonna happen, OK. Accept that.
Whoa, that Diet Coke just went straight to my head! Woo!
Chandler, I'm not gonna lie to ya, but I am gonna run away from you.
Okay Ross, we're-wait a minute. Umm, I uh, I kinda have a little confession.
Oh... Oh, I'm sorry! I'm not... I was just-I was just reading to Emma.
So who's idea was it to put everybody in the diner on skates?
Oh God, I hate my job, I hate it, I hate my job, I hate it.
For every night that you're asleep before I get home from work...
It just might be too hard, given the history and all that...
Uh, I don't have any brothers so I don't know, but uh, did you guys wrestle?
Yeah, it's a real shame you can't make it to that one-woman show tonight.
Ow. I don't want him to wake up alone! I should go to the hospital!
We're not gonna do this, all right? She's just gonna think that we're doin' it.
No, you're not! Last week you thought Ross was trying to kill you!
You knew that our hot, sweaty, writhing bodies were....
Well okay-Well don't ruin it! Just play along at least!
Yeah, yeah, you go talk to your friend. You tell him, "Nice try."
OK, listen, I'm sorry about last night and I really want to make it up to you.
I can not believe he would do that to Mon-Whoa! Joey, do they know that we know?
Okay. Hi Emma. Well, your first birthday is over, and it was really...
No, I have all of the good words. OK, fine, fine, we can switch.
She wants to move in with me and Ross to help take care of the baby.
Umm...that kiss before we left the apartment. That was some-something huh?
Wait a minute! She just made a scene in the middle of the ceremony!
Ah you went one too far. Uh, flowers or balloons?
Pheebs, Monica tripped me, I don't think I can ever run again, ever!
No Mon, you want to put them in concentric circles. I want to do this.
And not one of your coupons for an hour of "Joey Love."
Or Carol! But they're funny to kids and who is it hurting?!
Uhm... you haven't told these guys what they're doing in the wedding yet.
So Mon, when are we gonna meet this new secret waiter man?
Hello? Like he was really gonna send you one? She was a big girl.
Now, you do realize that she's a cartoon, and way out of your league?
No, I've just always wanted to do that. Can you help me clean this up?
Oh, maybe that's Emily calling back to leave the exact same message.
Well, y'know it's just been so long since I've been to Chuckie Cheese.
Yeah actually, I think we're gonna take off too. We rented a movie.
Hi Tag! Hey, so did you have fun with uh, with Joey last night?
N-it wasn't easy, but it's your birthday and I did what I got to do.
Yeah, and you don't mind if I call, because you only want good things for me.
All right, fine. Um, you were not the only one there. Joey was there too.
Y'know what? No. It's not over until someone says, "I do."
I can make you a legend. I can make you this generation's Milton Berle.
Ok I gotta tell ya, it's really weird when you use my whole name.
Well, do you want to hear what actually happened or Joey's lewd version?
Uh-huh. I know. It was just, it was just the perfect way to say goodbye.
Barry was the guy that I was almost married and Mindy was my best friend.
Good-good, don't tell him. Don't tell him. Just have him call me okay?
I don't know, something either trees or disease-Ralph mumbles a lot.
Oh my gosh, wow. Monica. Oh my god. Mom. This is so great.
Ross, she's not weird, she just wants her stuff to be one of a kind.
Joey, what are you doing with the bag? You're audition is not until tomorrow.
Okay, well if I stop playing with Joey and Chandler, can I play with Mark?
Well forget it, I'm not telling that girl anything. That is not my responsibility.
Come on you guys! What are doing?! I thought we were the patch sisters!
No. But I was showing him some cufflinks and I felt his pulse.
Oh no. I mean it. After what just happened, I'm never leaving her again.
I'll take all of your photos and put them into photo albums!
Yes, yes, Bombay is bery, bery nice time of year.
No, I mean with us, you know. I mean, is it supposed to be this... difficult?
With my alignment. I've got one leg shorter than the other.
Uh-huh. Okay. You know what, Joey, I don't think he's ever gonna be okay with this.
My father had an heart attack... ...while I was at Barney's.
Okay, I'll see you back at home, if I ever get a flight out of here.
Yeah, which, by the way Chandler, I would like back one of these days.
Noo!! No! You thought, you actually thought I wanted to have sex with you?!
No, no, that's ok. You won fair and square. I'm so sad!
Anyway, um, I guess this belongs to you. And thank you for giving it to me.
I'm sorry your wife is gay. I guess women aren't that great either.
Nice? They were nice. I mean, that's it? I mean, mittens are nice.
Oh I know, my God, this is so-this rice is so-I am so good.
Oh yeah, I'd actually love a blueberry muffin and a chamomile tea.
Okay. Ooh, my! Woah! Why is that baby torturing that woman?!
Oh Monica that was the best Thanksgiving dinner ever! I think you killed us.
Oh God, oh God, oh God oh God oh God oh God....
Y'know what, I-I have to go talk to her, would you let me just get changed?
Oh, well, you know, they're just separated so, you know, never know, we'll see.
I know, I know! I just can't keep this one in, so I pick up the phone...
Well, I will go to the hospital tomorrow, it'll still be broken then.
Ugh, that was so embarrassing! I can't believe you let me go on and on like that!
I mean Ross all that does is remind us that you are interested in fossils.
What?! The duck?! What the hell did the damn duck do now?!
Well, we were just talkin' about you guys gettin' married and how great it is.
Ohh, nothing, I just wanted to see you. See you and hug you. See you.
Well, if anyone is keeping score, I no longer eat tuna.
Ross is coming over. I think now would be a really good time to talk to him.
Oh thank you so much. Oh oh wait! You forgot your erm...Your game.
Ohh, I mean, we were really drunk. I'm just glad we didn't do anything stupid.
Yeah. Yeah. Oh, but once you find it, ohh it's so worth the wait.
Oh yeah, nothing! These are happy tears! This is just what I wanted.
Do you want me to come over there and sit on you? 'Cause I'll do it.
Well, I didn't get the job at Gucci and I got fired from Ralph Lauren.
Well that is because your eye immediately goes to the big naked man.
Wh-no, but y'know who did stop in here looking for ya, Tennille.
"I'm Monica, I don't get phone messages from interesting people. Ever!"
Yes it is! I saw you guys going at it behind the card catalog!
I'm sorry, you know, maybe I wasn't being clear. Uh, this is our cart.
Ooh! Honey, it can't be that hard, I mean, you've been in love before?
Uh. No.. I was going to let you use my Ralph Lauren discount.
Thank God you're here! You have to help me! Were you just talking to yourself?
Oh, Ross, c'mon, please! Don't make this harder than it already is!
Funny, because I was just gonna go across the hall and write that on Chandler.
OK, OK, that is my favorite sweater, that is my third date sweater.
Well if you go to Disneyland, you don't spend the whole day on the Materhorn.
Yeah, this is Tag. Tag, this is Phoebe. Phoebe, can I see you for a second?
Oh no, I'm good, I don't wanna get that turkey smell all over my hands.
All right. So you're telling me that there is nothing going on between you and Chandler.
Okay Monica, what are you doing? You're gonna lose your job! This is not you!
Did you tell the doctor you did it jumping up and down on your bed?
Come on! I am here to take care of you! What do you need? Anything.
For like a half an hour! Man, you can lie about Sweden!
Ughhhh!! Forget it! This is, this is not how this is supposed to happen.
Did-did you come up here to work on that term paper or something?
Ok... I got a spider. There were two, I picked the bigger one.
That's right, still no baby! Come on people! Please make some room!
Yeah! Can you believe that something that stupid actually got us our apartment back?
Oh thank god, if Phoebe's going, can we please take Emma home?
I know. Yeah, see, there's so much to do and I have so little time to do it in.
Yeah, but I don't know why. Look at me, I'm having such a wonderful time!
Ross, no! There is no way I am leaving this room looking like this!
Yeah, maybe if you're in love. But Ross, we are not in love, are we?
Well, I mean, sure, of course. But... you already gave that to Monica, so...
Well umm, that one is pretty but uh, I just, I just love this fabric Sorry.
I can't believe I ever even tried to help you. You are so beyond help.
Well, there's a kiss that he won't forget for a couple of hours, y'know.
Well, wait a minute! The puss is good! It means it's healing!
Okay, now that is the third time someone has said something like that to me today.
Oh! Good thing Chandler's not here, he always wins at this game.
Hmm. Umm, why do you have a copy of The Shining in your freezer?
Well, we're a little early, the lecture doesn't end for 15 minutes.
Look at that! Look at that! We all do it. Okay, I'm stopping now.
Ooh, so cute, that I'm thinking about jamming this pen in my eye.
She could be out of town. Maybe she'll be gone for months.
Hey! Hey, you guys, I finished the crossword all by myself! Hug me!
Oh no Dr. Long, please come in. This is Ross, he is the father.
You guys, does this look like something the girlfriend of a paleontologist would wear?
Yeah and you stretch 'em out with your big old clown feet.
Phoebe? I'm sorry about the whole lifting out thing. You gotta come with me!
Ok, careful, ok. Oh, she's smiling! Oh my God, she does like it!
Well, y'know what, no, you do not make my decisions because y'know what, you're fired.
All right, okay. Alright, let's give to these babies something to cry about!
Well, you know I'm not surprised. I mean have you seen them together, they're really cute.
Oh, oh thanks. Alright well, now that I'm up I'm going to go to the bathroom.
Ohh no you don't! You got lighting last time, lighting is mine!
Ohh! This is so exciting! Oh God... Come and knock on my door...
Monica, last Saturday night, what happened on Walker Texas Ranger?
Well, basically, lately, I've uh, I've uh, sort of had feelings for you.
That's good enough. Right? Okay, well umm, I'm gonna go look at my books!
Hey, listen, Ronni, how long would you say Chandler's been in the shower?
Okay, so anyway I'm sittin' in my office and guess who walks in.
Hey! Joey, would you mind giving me and Ross a hand moving his couch?
Yeah, we ended up spending the day together and had such a great time!
Hi! Hey, remember how last night we were talking about that movie Cujo?
What? Wait a minute. What are you saying, that I'm a pushover? I'm not a pushover.
Ohh, please! Cooking soothes me. Ahh. So, dig in!
Oh no, I'm sorry, you look a lot different from the last time I-I saw you.
Oh my God, you guys, what am I doing? What am I doing? This is so un-me!
You know what? There is a little part of me that really thought we were gonna win.
Oh My God, Phoebe, that's not Ralph Lauren. That's Kenny the copy guy.
Well, I don't know about that, but some said that I looked like a floating angel.
Honey, no one thinks you're a pansy, but we do think you need a tissue.
All right, all right, well you just blew your chances at dating Bob!
Ummmm.... well, actually I'm already done, but I...I kinda got plans.
Uh, Paul's Caf. They got great food and it's really romantic.
Hey! Out of all of us, who do you think is gonna get married next?
I can't believe Mark didn't call. It's Sunday night, and he didn't call.
Oh, well, it's complicated. I don't actually have a boyfriend. But um. . .
Yeah! Oh by the way, thank you for loaning us Pamela and Yasmine.
All right, I promise. I'll fix this. I swear. I'll-I'll-I'll-I'll talk to her.
Well, sure...just a sec, though, 'cause Paolo's on his way over.
Both of them are here, both of them, both of them are here?
No, he told me. He prefers to leave certain things to the imagination.
Oh my God!! Ohh, that is it! I'm leaving! You are just a horrible person!
Well do you get to look through one of those like, those periscope thingys.
Okay. Oh man, I swear if they sold these at Pottery Barn...
Y'know, with the right pair of pumps, that would be a great little outfit.
Oh my God! We are throwing the most depressing baby shower ever!
Well, if it makes you feel any better, I made a fool out of myself.
Phoebe?! Wait a-but-but she just, she said that Joey was her backup.
Oh, God, do you think she heard? It would be so bad if she heard!
Well, Ross, we were worried about you. We didn't know how you were going to react.
I am sorry! Again... I don't know, I don't know what happened, I must be nervous!
Oh my God! Look what... you made it into a bunny. How did you do that?
He even offered to meet me for lunch tomorrow to prep me for it.
I can imagine you in a short plaid skirt and knee socks.
Ohh, you can say. Come on, I don't want you to feel like you can't tell me things.
Ross! What are you... I'm sorry sir. I just, I think he just really likes you.
You guys, I'm doing the best I can, anyone else is welcome to try.
Y'know who doesn't even like dirty movies? My new boyfriend Joshua.
Well hello! So, when are we gettin' back out on the water matey?
Ugh, you will not believe what that sleaze-ball from Ralph Lauren did too me!
Hey, honey! What's the matter? Fine, I was just trying to be nice! Whoa!
Wow! Tell me something Joey--Whoa! I just fell right off the couch there.
O-kay!! See what you did, I'm gonna be doing it by myself now. Okay?
Well, I usually go... play Tetris on somebody else's computer.
Well-well you can give them to me! I haven't felt my feet in years!
Hello! Oh yeah! Hey! Hold on a second she's right here! It's Chandler.
Oh honey, I'll say good-bye to you at the car if you don't mind the puss.
I can't go to my own prom without a date, I can't, it's too late.
Okay sweetie, you can do it. Just open up and put it in your mouth.
Oh hey-hey wait! How do we fairly decide who gets the phone?
Honey, someday you are gonna make some man the luckiest guy in the world.
Ok, Chandler, Mon, there's only one bananna nut muffin left.
Really! What is with that guy? I mean you'd forgive me if I fogged you.
Ok, thanks Pheebs Oh my God, why have I never tasted these before?!
I cannot believe that after ten years, you do not know ONE thing about me.
Right, you, you only had a year. We only hung out every night.
But my... but my boss cannot see me. I'm interviewing for another job.
That's your new job, day and night, she starts crying I need you here.
Hi guys! This is Josh. Josh, these are my friends, and that's Ross.
Phoebe! It's 6 o'clock in the morning! Why aren't you at Gary's?
OK, you know what, are, are you being like, the blind date guy again?
Ow ow ow. Ow ow ow. Ow ow ow.
A mistake?! What were you trying to put it in? Her purse?!
Wait a minute, you're only giving free stuff away to the pretty girls?
Really? Just casually strewn about in that reckless haphazard manner?
Hey, listen, Joey, about Molly, I really prefer if you didn't go after her.
Because you're not finished yet and I won't have it! Greens do not quit!
What, slept together a year and a half ago? Yeah, I'm all set.
Joey, come on! It doesn't matter, you know, it's not like anything's gonna happen.
Wait! No, that's ridiculous. Come on, he lives three blocks away!
I'm hoping that if she hears it enough it will be her first word.
Ok, let's work from the top down! Just work the bra, Joe!
You see, you look beautiful. For god sakes, dim the lights.
And the fact that you were jeopardising my career never entered your mind?!
Ok, not that you need it but good...GOD!Is that Chase Lassiter?He's straight, right?
I know I had it this morning, and I know I had it when I was in the kitchen with...
Hey, you know, before you said that nothing could happen between us? What changed?
Uh, I think I just did. And uh-oh, here it comes again. Shut up!
Okay honey, you can finish this later we're gonna be late. We gotta go.
OH! Alright, you know what? That's it! I want my share of the tickets !
Oh God I just can not imagine what is gonna happen if Chandler doesn't show up!
Well, from me. And I know it's not your big money song, but it's my favorite.
Ohhh! Well of course I will watch him! We have fun, don't we Ben?
It's not! I'm defrosting a chicken. Oh, I uh sold Mrs. Whiskerson.
Now Joey remember, if you win you have to hug me! You hug me!
Yeah. Yeah. Definitely, well it definitely took me by surprise, but I'm okay.
It's okay. Sometimes, things don't work out the way you'd thought they would.
Thank you! And now if you'll excuse me, I have to go to the rest room.
Wow! Have you ever rescued anyone from a burning building before?
Honey wait, Joey, I'm sorry I mean as terrific as I think you are with it...
Oh Amy, don't cry Amy. Um.. Ross, could I talk to you in private?
And I also wanted you guys to know that I am telling the father today. What? What? What?
Wow, this is so cool, you guys. The entire city is blacked out!
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! I'm sorry, semi-private? We , we asked for a private room.
This bench, it's hollow! I can't believe I never knew that! Oh, the presents!!!
Well, okay, look. I don't know, listen, I don't know what's going on here but let's...
It's okay! It's okay! It kicked once, it'll kick again!
Joey, you're gonna have to stop rushing me, you know what? You don't get any dessert.
Oh, thank God you're here! You have to help me! Were you just talking to yourself?
I mean if you think about it, I mean Ross did learn something from each marriage.
Are ah, having dinner with my Dad tomorrow night, I hope that's okay.
And your lap does not count! Okay? Come on help me move this.
OK Julie, so now let's start with your childhood, what was that like?
Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, why are we so sure that this is a girl?
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Would you stay here with me for a little while?
What?! What?! He was trying to cheer me up! My pony was sick.
No, you're right, you are absolutely right. I mean that makes, that makes everything different.
Oh my God! Did you check your entire desk! Did you check all the drawers!
So, you had a good day huh? Big commission; picked up a daddy.
Well I can do whatever I want! I made her! Come on little girl, hi!
OK, well, you wouldn't let me finish and I was jus- Ow. That hurt
Oh, and Monica gets to keep her? In her house? I am so jealous!
We're just really...very excited about this charity event that we have to go to.
Well, don't look at me! My hair's straight! Straight! Straight! Straight!
Well, I've been up since six. Thanks to somebody's dumb-ass rooster.
What? No! It's not a big deal! I do that too, with my shampoo bottle.
Hey. I've got something that's gonna make you happy. Guess what Gunther found?
Yeah, I-I-I just pulled the tab and I just fogged his yeti ass!
Oh, that's why you got these tickets to that play, to get rid of us??
Yeah, down from seven hundred, you are saving like two hundred bucks!
How do you think this suit would look on an assistant buyer at Bloomingdale's?
No! No, I am not getting in a car with Ross, we will just have to live here!
Well that-y'know it's just uh, I've never done that before. Me and him alone.
Okay please tell me that this is just one of your jokes that you do that I don't get.
Isn't this amazing? I mean, I have never made coffee before in my entire life.
Ross, you are so pathetic. Why can't your son just play with his doll?
And you weren't going to tell us? How did you think you were gonna get away with that?
: Thank you. : I saw your twenty-five, and I raise you... seven.
I will wake you up in a way that's proved very popular in the past.
Well y'know, we have 7 people and like 10 pizzas, what do you think?
Hey Joey, what would you do if someone that you slept with told you that she was pregnant?
You want me to just quit my job so that you can feel like you've got a girlfriend?
No, see this isn't about the movie theatre, this is about you stealing my wind.
Yeah so get ready to hear alot of ehm...boohaki, goshdarnit and brotherpucker.
I ah... Oh! I'll squeeze you fresh orange juice every morning!
You know the book says that whenever she's sleeping I should be sleeping so...
Oh that's not important. The point is, I really-I think everything's gonna be okay.
I don't know! But maybe if we keep that drawer shut, it'll die.
Yeah, honey, maybe you can talk to somebody who's had a baby. Like your mom?
What? Come on, you do what you want to do. Do we always have to do everything together?
Okay... Let me put it this way. Anything from Crabtree and Evelyn?
I don't know. What do you mean last night? Nothing, nothing uh, happened last night.
Ohh... Oh, honey here. Take it all. Monica! We need more candy?
Oh he's dusting me with a fossil brush. He thought it would be funny.
That sounds like a plan. Umm, is there a place I can go freshen up?
Oh, stop that! Don't kid about that! Will all the stars be there?
Wha!? What!? Come on! I found the hardware store all by myself!
Ross, she still has not noticed that the baby's sock is on the ground.
Well that's gross, why don't you just take it outside and throw it in a dumpster?
But what choice did I have. He was keeping my sister in a dungeon!
I'm Monica's maid of honor. Okay? Don't try to blue pin me!
Whoa, wait, listen, I think I'm just gonna talk to Ross about what he think it meant.
Well, I didn't see Joshua last night, but I did punch a girl in the face.
Oh, that's what this is all about? Did you bring her up here to get back at me?
Well, legend has it Joey, that... she comes alive when you're asleep.
Joey, is this that thing that you do when you say you're bad so I'll give you a compliment?
Hey! Ross and I were looking for you! What are we all doing in here? Oh, my!
No, y'know what? Maybe somebody came in here and fixed it! Or something!
Oh, ooh, everything looks delicious. What should I ha-ave? What should I have?
Yes, I know! And Joey knows! But Ross doesn't know so you have to stop screaming!!
Monica, what are you talking about? You don't know the first thing about the stock market.
No. But she did give us some ideas on how to induce labor.
Oh. Well then, you better go take that back because they're gonna charge you for that.
I don't know, y'know? I feel a little umm... No, y'know what? Nevermind, I'm gonna be fine.
Did I say I was done guessing? Okay, thank you for that. Oh wow! What's this?
Oh we were, but that was just a , I mean that was just a big drunken mistake.
I'm sorry, I was just reading the joke below it. Man, that one is funny.
Stop it! I will kill you. I hate the fact that my room is so small.
No, I have two sisters. But one of them has a very masculine energy.
No, you're right. Well, we'll find something. Let's just get you out of that. Come on.
Uh, morning. Do you guys think you could close your eyes for just a sec?
Hey. Whe-ell, look at you, finally got that time machine workin' huh?
No, I'm just kidding I would never do that to you! Okay, everybody, it's trifle time!
Please! During that second time you couldn't have picked her out of a lineup!
So what?! Y'know what? The way I see it--Ow! Son of a bitch!!
I don't care! I wanna meet this guy who's the best sex she ever had!
All right, y'know what, come on, do we really have to watch this while we eat?
Joey? Could you get that? What are you doing here? I thought you were in your room?
Uh-huh, yeah I did, because I wore out my first copy when I was with you.
Everybody, this is Paolo. Paolo, I want you to meet my friends. This is Monica.
And last year is that why you sent us to that medieval times restaurant?
Ohh, are you setting Ross up with someone? Does she have a wedding dress?
No, no-no-no. Phoebe, this was my fault and besides y'know what? I'm fine here.
Oh no, wait a minute, wait, I've got a presentation tomorrow. I can't miss that.
Oh yeah, sorry. Wait honey, so what did you do that made dad cut you off?
And by the way, have I mentioned that back in high school, I was a cow?
Okay, well can't you just try it one more time Ross? For me? For me?
Honey, why don't you sit down? Dina has something that she wants to tell you.
God. I forgot how much I love driving. I have got to get my license renewed.
Oh my God, it's so huge, but you just have to promise me that you cannot tell anyone.
Thanks, but I gotta go to work and get my eyes scratched out by Mindy.
Wow! Look at that, Chip Matthews called. I wonder what he wants?
Well, you know that my parents are out of town and Chip was going to come over...
God, Ross, look, what you and I have is special, all Paolo and I ever had was...
Yes, you did-Oh my God you didn't! Well then why didn't you tell me that before?!
Alright, look, I have to go. I love you, and I will call you the minute I get to Paris.
Oh hell, he's done this three times! He knows what its about!
And so bad. I don't even know what you're talking about because I didn't ask you to do anything!
Okay. So what? You guys would just like get together and like just say mean things about me?
Well, I don't know, you guys figure it out, I got to put Emma down for a nap.
Alright, enough, enough, come on. Let's just all go in at the same time.
Man, don't be surprised if her hands and her feet get bigger too!
Ok, ok, so you're not a fan, but I mean, come on, you cannot do this to her.
Oh, yeah, I had too. There was never any parking by the Psychology building.
Uh... You didn't propose to me, Chandler didn't propose to me, but Joey did.
Oh my God. Can you imagine if there was?! I mean, what would happen exactly.
No! Forget it! I am not gonna ask Frank to give you one of his kids!!
Yeah, well, I guess I have forgotten about Joey and clearly you've forgotten about Chandler!
Yeah, Rachel. And this is Ross' sister, Monica. We met at Thanksgiving. .
Oh, I am, my side still hurts from when you crashed into me yesterday.
Oh my God! Calling from Rome! Bon giorno, caro mio.
No really, she didn't sleep well last night, so we can't wake her up.
If you like looking at butts so much why don't you just go look at a mirror?
Hello? Uh, Rachel. Great, someone is in our apartment. Call the cops!
Ohh! That's so sweet of you! Oh yum! Did you put pickles on this?
Please, make sure she comes. It's really important to me, I mean it's my mom!
Wow, you know what? That is the best fake speech I think I've ever heard.
Ok Sexy, sexy, very sexy, sexy. Alright! Lets do it!
Well uh, yes and no. Except not no. So to sum it up, yeah.
Well, I was kinda supposed to be headed for Aruba on my honeymoon, so nothing!
I just y'know, I didn't expect him to be this happy so soon. Ufff. Ooo-ooh!
No! No, she's-She was nice. I mean, she's a little slutty, but who isn't?
Ye-ah. Yeah! You know, the money's great. It's certainly the easier choice...
No Phoebe! I just need you there for support. I haven't told him I'm pregnant yet.
And you've got lenses! But you hate sticking your finger in your eye!
Y'know what Chandler, you got yourself into those cuffs, you get yourself out of them.
Yeah, and none of these stupid grocery questions, real personal questions.
Well then honey, buy the lamp! Hey, we have that 60 bucks from Ross.
Yeah. Oh, yeah. And I mean, the connection, I mean y'know, emotionally, mentally, physically...
No, you! Phoebe you freaked me out. You kept saying how huge this all is!
And you're gonna want him to eat his heart out so you're gonna have to look fabulous!
I don't know. We were watching TV, and then he pooped in Monica's shoe-
Perfect. Fasten your seatbelts, it's peepee time. Hey, Mr. Trib.
Honey, why is it hard, I mean we've been together for almost a year now?
Monica and Chandler are really moving in here and I have to move out and everything is changing.
Well, y'know what? Actually, I was about to bid on this lovely trip to Paris.
Yeah, and could you please chop some up and just put it right there in the sauce?
Ross! I just had a conversation with her, and she said that she and Joey made a deal!
Okay, oh, here's what you do. Just act like everything around you turns you on.
But I thought that ring stood for Caprice's undying love for her brother.
Yeah, when we're in the audience he doesn't talk to us, but he does wave.
This is the worst date ever. How could you set me up with this creep?
And I still have about five seconds to spare. Okay, that was about seven seconds.
Well yeah, I wish that you would. Well, no it's not in there! How about that drawer?
Look, you know what, I'm sorry, but did you really think that this was going well? What's up?
Monica, y'know what? The only reason I did that was because your party was so boring!
All right, easy mimey, the moment has passed, it ain't gonna happen!
Well, y'know, a little of this, a little of that. Got myself a date tomorrow night.
Well, where is he? He is supposed to be here. What if the baby needs him?
Wow, y'know if Joey and Chandler walked in right now, we could make a fortune!
Oh Ross, come on. He's happily married. His wife just had twins.
Oh my God! Wow! That was fantastic, I almost leaned in. I really almost did!
All right, you know what? I am not leaving here, until you call that plane back!!
Why are you adding, why are you adding, why are you adding, why are you adding?
Oh yes! Thank you very much! Oh that's-that's actually how the French drink it.
Umm, Chandler, you do realize that those ideas are probably already in Monica's head.
No, but it's good, you know, I'm gonna take some time off and do some charity work.
Okay, I'm just gonna go over the basic points just one more time, are you ready?
Do you guys have to go to the new house right away, or do you have some time?
Oh, well, we can hand it to Gunther and he'll put it in lost and found.
Y'know I can't believe I even thought about getting back together again! We are so over!!
Remember I had to leave the room the other day when you had that roast chicken?
Alright, I can't, I can't wait that long. You have to do something-knock that door down!
ah ha ha. ah ha ha. It's forty five.
Yes, absolutely. I would wait and wait. . . then I'd wait some more.
Yeah, kicking a guy in the crotch all morning really takes it out of ya!
That sounds great! I'd love to live at Warren's!! I love Warren! Thank you!
Hey, nice pillow. So now tell me, is this genuine Muppet skin?
What, what, so that you can dance with the woman that stole your credit card?
Well, we were paying for our stuff and this saleswoman just started flirting with him.
Y'know, you-you also could've used uh, lamps and then followed the light.
Yeah! Yeah. They're...they're-they're my friends, uh, Monica Stephanopolus and uh, and Chandler Acidofolus.
I just never thought I would raise this baby all by myself. Pretty dumb huh?
Yeah, we're, we're actually just gonna walk 'cause it's right up there at the Angelica.
Oh my god. Oh my god. Excuse me. Move! Move! Emergency! Excuse me!
Oh, nothing, he's just goofy like that, I actually, hardly notice it anymore.
Oh, you guys, I can't believe this. But I'll leave now, or I'm gonna miss my plane.
Okay, you are crazy! I'm sorry, but she sounded generally upset! I mean, listen!
Yeah? Okay! Good, good, because he's coming. He's coming. Hey, what's up?
Hey Joey, will you please set this up for people to put Emma's presents on?
Wow! I don't remember him. Honey, are you sure you're not talking about your imaginary boyfriend.
Wow, he's cute, Pheebs! But I thought you just started dating that Kindergarten teacher.
All right, listen, missy. If you want this cart, you're gonna have to take me with it!
Hey you guys, this is my sister Amy. This is Chandler, Joey, Phoebe and you know Mon.
All right here he comes. I'm gonna do this, I'm gonna tell him, I'm gonna be strong.
Oh, uhm, excuse me, I'm here to see my father. My name is Rachel Green.
Well you know, after about thirty or forty fights, you kinda catch on.
Well excuse me, my fashion-impaired friends, I am here to tell you that hats are back.
Ross, Chandler wrote something about me on his computer and he won't let me see.
Pheebs, I don't know what to say. I guess the flea market was just better last time.
Do you really not know where I'm going with this? It left! It's one huge room!
Here you go Pheebs. Who else wants one of my special homemade brownies?
Ohh, you should know, this place is a real babe magnet. Wanna make out?
Sure Pheebs, you know, that's what it's there for, emergencies and pretend agents.
Ah yes, but he's very protective of me so you'd better watch yourself.
I mean, do you think there are people who go through life never having that kind of...
Umm, you-you and your sister seem to have umm, a very special bond, and...
You know what I'm going to do? I'm going to get in my sweats, and eat this in bed!
Well Joey, I hate to admit it, your way of sailing is a lot more fun.
Last night! I just felt it and I went into Joey's room and he was sleeping...
She'll be out in a second. So, Chip, how's umm, Amy Welch?
Yeah that's right you weren't thinking! Y'know what? Let me give you something to think about!
You and your stupid fear. I hate your fear. I would like to take you and your fear....
Now, come on, come on, Steve. There must be something that you like about yourself.
Okay, Phoebe, honey, you gotta be kidding. I mean, you know you cannot keep one of these babies!
Well, I'm really sick of your smoking, so I brought something that is going to help you quit.
Well, is Ross home? Maybe I'll just call him to see if he's actually seen her.
Then you're not gonna like what's coming. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Thank you, thank you.
Okay, Pheebs, quick, what shoes should I wear? The black or the purple?
Wow! H-umm! Hi! Yes, uh I'm sorry the models are actually down the hall.
Oh my God! Joey Tribbiani from Days of Our Lives, just walked in here!
Really? Oh thank you! Oh... Oh, would it be completely inappropriate to give you a hug?
...we went back the house and we got really silly and we...we made out.
Well, sure, but they might think it's kinda weird considering I don't work there anymore.
All right, well, you're right, these are the best oatmeal cookies I've ever had.
Okay Joey, we're luffing a little bit, so could you tighten up the cunningham?
Ooh, goooosh, ooh, these are cookies smashed in the sports section.
Wow, oh my God, our child will be beaten to death in the schoolyard.
Yep. Oh, yeah, look you great. Oh yeah. Yeah, this looks great. Umm, so you like it?
Ross did I ever tell you about the time that I went backpacking through Western Europe?
No! You gotta get me out of here Phoebe! These bargain shoppers are crazy!
Remember when we went to Central Park and rented boats?.. That was fun.
All right, fine, but don't get mad at me. It's-it's just a little hard to believe.
Oh! Shoot! Damn it! Where is it? Oh! Oh! I found it! I found it!
Oh but he did say that they found the grandmother wandering down fifth avenue.
Y'know what? I think we can just leave it at that. It's kinda like a symbolic gesture...
Noooo, no, I'm not mad at him. I'm.. I'm not really anything at him anymore.
Monica, what did you mean before when you said you didn't want to talk to anyone, especially me?
Okay, fine! But you know what? If I was in 36D, we would not be having this problem.
Monica, Monica, look at this lamp. Is this tacky or what? We have to have this.
Ok, uh, Billy Dreskin, Pete Carney, Barry, and uh, oh, Paolo.
Ross, there is no pressure on you. Okay? I mean you can as involved as you want.
Okay. Okay. It's-since you've never done it before you can be Monica's made of honor.
Okay, good. Now that since you know, when you come over would you mind actually using it?
Yeah. So Frank, three babies. Whew, that just seems like a lot, huh?
whhh wait, you're gonna leave my party to take care of a box of rats?
No-no! Don't dance for me! Please? Don't! What is the matter with you guys?
Absolutely. Shoop, shoop, shoop. Only a hundred and two dollars to go.
Joey relax! My mother picked her up two hours ago. You were there!
I'm training to be better at a job that I hate, my life officially sucks.
Amy, that's what I was supposed to wear today, that's why I hung it on the door.
Here we go. I'm serving my last cup of coffee. There you go. Enjoy.
I still can't believe you invited Gavin. Allright, he is the last person I want to see.
Okay? Wait okay, tell-tell me that you like him, please? I mean tell me that you like him.
Okay, but taking care of a drunk, naked woman seems like a job for Joey.
Okay, stop what you're doing, I need envelope stuffers, I need stamp lickers.....
On Melanie Griffith in "Working girl". I think what you want is over here.
He just kept asking, and asking, and asking, and asking, and asking, and asking.
Okay, my boss, Joanna, when you left, she started asking questions about you...
Oh Chandler, I know, I know... oh, hey! You can see your nipples through this shirt!
So uh, so did anything happen? Because rumor has it you guys shut the drapes!
Hey! Wait a minute! That was different! I did those things because I was in love with you!
Alright, fine. You can keep it. As long as you don't mind that she's haunted.
Oh, I'm sure gonna miss pretending to laugh at your weird jokes that I don't get.
I know! It's like I'm being punished for not having this disgusting, poisoning habit!
Ooh! Look! Look! Look! Look, there's Joey's picture! This is so exciting!
No I wasn't! You were supposed to tell her to come and I was supposed to bring the cake!
Yeah! And she's comforted by him because she loves her uncle Joey so much.
Okay. What the hell was that? You know what? Don't answer me. I have a date with Danny.
So. Ross, I've bugged him about this a million times, he's not gonna change.
Julie! Julie, isn't that great? I mean, isn't that just kick-you-in-the-crotch, spit-on-your-neck fantastic?
Have I been living with him for too long, or did that all just make sense?
It's still--It's got a tail! Get it out of here! Get it out of here!!
I'm going to find out if he really thinks supermodels are too skinny. Hey, Pheebs!
I mean he was possessive, he was jealous, he could never just let the little things go!
Of course he will! But Chandler the most important thing is you forgive yourself!
Joey! The baby is kicking for the first time! Will you please come feel this?!
These are, these aren't for you. These are for you. Welcome to our country.
No, I know, I know, and I'm sure your little boy is not going to grow up to be one.
Honey, might I suggest watching a little more ESPN and a little less E!?
Honey, this really is an incredible thing to do for them, but there are things to think about.
Oh and it was great to see you too. And you look fantastic, although you missed a button.
What? I'm not you. This may be the only wedding I ever have. I want it to be amazing.
Umm, I said I thought you were a good kisser, and uh, and that I like your tiney-tiny touchie.
Okay, see now, what I just heard, blah-blah-blah, blah-blah-blah-blah-blah, blah-blah-blah, blah, blah.
Yeahh, but, but those really go better with pants. Maybe I should wear pants?
Well Joey, uhm look, I know that she's difficult, but I think it's really good that she's here.
Well, does a good student drink seven beers during his first lesson?
Thanks for lunch, Chandler. Y'know, you didn't have to walk me all the way back up here.
Oh wait-wait-wait!! No! Don't go in there! Don't go in there! I need another soda!
Oh, it is so unfair. It's like that time they promoted Sandra over me at work.
Uh, I-I had a drink with lunch. Did those cost reports come in?
Yes you do, if you're going to make me feel guilty for getting a free massage!
Hey-hey, you guys oh hurry up, get some, there's a whole cart outside...
All right. We figured you might respond this way, so we have a backup offer.
What?! Wait! What are you talking about?! You love their Kung Pao Chicken!
Well lets see. Maybe he knows where Ross is. Hey, how's it going .
Ohh! And I'm one of them!! Wow! Oh, I just cannot believe this! I mean, Joey Tribbiani!
Well, if it makes you feel any better, I wish my date hadn't shown up.
No! Of course we can wait. Alright, so I guess that means good night then?
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You're right, you are a tough guy. You're the toughest palaeontologist I know.
Listen honey, can you keep dad occupied, I'm gonna go talk to mom for a while.
Yeah, we wanted to throw you a big surprise and a great shower, and now you don't have either.
You WHAT? And I missed it? Because I was giving a makeover to that stupid hippie?
Yes it is! It is true! I went, I went after Ross in stupid London.
Yeah, but that just means that he was falling asleep on top of her instead of me.
Well, just because it happened that way for them doesn't mean it has to happen that way for us.
No! No! It's just that all the people in the entire world that I want to talk to are right here.
Sorry!! I just feel bad about all that sleep you're gonna miss wishing you were with me!
Well, you more then me, but he can't stay to mad at me. I mean, I just had his baby.
Oh, you're gonna love this cake. I got it from a bakery in New Jersey, Corino's.
No! Come on! Don't make me go long. Use me. They never cover me.
She spit up. Judy! She spi...Judy! Look alive, Judy! Thank you.
All right. Well listen, if you see Joey will you just tell him uh...tell him I miss him.
Yes, my wind. How do you expect me to grow if you won't let me blow?
Ooooh! Honey, well we'll find you something. Do you wanna wear my black jacket?
Yes you do. You think of it as your apartment, and I'm just somebody who rents a room.
Okay no way, you cannot use that to get the cute guy and the last blueberry muffin.
Can you believe this is already happening? I mean it seems like yesterday they just got engaged.
Oh, yeah, well... Yeah, no use wasting this baby, just lyin' around the house.
Yeah but y'know what they say Mon, "There's no such thing as bad press."
Well, ultimately, I was trying y'know, I-I wanted...tell him y'know, that I'm still in love with him.
...you were 50 minutes late to the class, what did you crawl there?!
She has got so much going on we-we have only two options. We have Friday...
Uh, wait, so you guys are telling me you actually did the routine from eighth grade?
Joey, if you wanna look good, why don't you just come down to the store? I'll help you out.
Oh my God! What if he thinks I'm the kind of girl that-that would just sleep with him?
I don't know, I, I feel like I had a dream about you last night but I, I don't remember.
Oh no-no, no! It's good! It's all good! I-I actually work at Ralph Lauren!
Oh my God, I can't believe this is a real $20,000 check, oh this is just so exciting.
Well, actually Gunther sent me. You're not allowed to have cups out here, it's a thing.
Ok, let me take these cakes back 'cause they're gonna take that out of my paycheck.
I just wanted to let you know I've changed my mind: I'm gonna do it, I'm gonna kiss Joey.
Hey! Hey-hey, now this was no one's fault Pheebs. Okay? It was an accident.
Well, now, wait. Now I'm all freaked out. Come on, you guys will watch it with me.
Ok, ok, Roger was creepy, but he was nothing compared to Pete Carney.
No-no-no! No-no-no! Please Ross, I can't! I can't do it! It's just gonna freak me out!!!
Yeah, we got a lot to do! We gotta think about the flowers, the caterers, the music...
Be-because I didn't want him to think I was stupid! I mean, that was really embarrassing what happened to you!
No you guys, I am not getting in a car with him, you'll have to think of something else.
I am so proud of Joey, I can't believe he's going to be on Law & Order!
Ohh... I mean two best friends falling in love, how often does that happen?
Of course you did Ross, you would date a gorilla if it called you Indiana Jones!
But you said that you liked him! I mean what happened?! Did ya just change your mind?!
No? Y'know, I can tie one of these into a knot using just my tongue.
Daddy, I just... I can't marry him! I'm sorry. I just don't love him. Well, it matters to me!
Uh-huh, I get it, smoke, chimney, chimney sweep, very funny, ha-ha.
Ross, this is not how we wanted you to find out about this. You have every right to go nuts.
Ok, great, because I gotta get out of here, the smell of beets is killing me!
Well, I met Danny's sister yesterday, and uh that was actually the girl on the subway.
Yeah no, I mean it was at a flea market, so it was y'know, it was like a dollar.
Chandler, you have just described virtually every man that we have ever gone out with.
So you're gonna be in the car, I will be upstairs, and that's where everybody's gonna be!
Okay, first of all, that's stupid and second of all, I'm not allowed to talk to Ralph.
Yeah, and if doesn't work, then we'll be just one of those couples that never have sex.
Uh well, y'know what? I don't think if I feel comfortable stealing on my very first day...
Oh, it's so easy for you I mean, you're not married, you get to have sex with who ever you want!
: So basically, you get your ya-yas by taking money from all of your friends.
Oh, yeah, I'm sorry. They used to live here; sometimes they migrate back over.
What do you get? Emily!! Emil-Whoa!! Okay! So that's me as a cheerleader! Ta-dum!
Well, let's see. The first one is: I don't want to. And, you know, I'm not going.
Ugh, Ross! That was not a near death experience! That was barely an experience!
You know, Ross, just keep making your jokes. How are you gonna feel if we actually do win?
Yeah-No wait! Joey no wait it is. It's something. It's-it's umm...it's my boss.
Oh, no problem. You can borrow it, by the way. Here are your keys, hon.
Okay, that's gonna take them a minute. Do you have anything else you wanna get off your chest?
You need that, you need that too 'cause obviously, a thief could just tear this up.
Oh!... Oh and Emma, look at your stuffed animals lined up so neatly!
Well, last time I almost got fired. You must end it, you must end it now!
Hello? Yeah, this is she. Oh! You're kidding! You're kidding! Oh thank you! I love you!
All right, believe me.If you win the lottery, it's the last you're gonna hear from us!
Yeah, and y'know what? I love them both, so why don't you just pick one and that'll be it.
Ross, c'mon, please. Can we just get out of here, before somebody else gets hurt?
Is my hook unhooked? These things keep falling down, I can't. . .
Y'know what? I cannot do this with my left hand! Would you please, help me with this too?
Well, then, I guess that's the difference between us. See, I'd never make a list.
I know. I know. Oh God. There's no tissue! Can you grab me some toilet paper?
I'm just gonna go in my office and pick up some stuff . Who the hell are you!?
I mean, I'll fly back and forth, they'll fly you out... Anything we want.
Ooh! Y'know what? If we made reservations, we could have unagi in about a half-hour.
Ooooh, that's fine. We'll see who has the last laugh there, monkey boy.
Oh! Did you hear that?! My dad's proud of me! My dad's proud of me.
I love him. He's so pretty I wanna cry! I don't know what to do. Tell me what to do.
No. I just need to be by myself for a while, you know? I just got to figure out what I want
Yeah but how do I start? I mean, what's-what's the first thing that I say? Okay great! Thanks.
What? Monica, they are cute, they are doctors, cute doctors, doctors who are cute!
Hey... hi, ladies... uh, can I get you anything? : Did you bring the mail?
I think, if it was a little colder in here I could see your nipples through that sweater.
Oh no! No! It's actually-it's very sweet. It's very sweet. Look! Yeah, do you want it?
I know you did. I'm just gonna deal with it, I'm just gonna deal with it. I gotta get out of here.
Oh yeah. Well, at least I wasn't too chicken to tell some guy I thought he was cute.
Late thirties? Oh come on you guys! Is it just me? Am I overreacting to this?
Well it's only different if he wants it to be. I mean, I'm not gonna ask him for anything.
Alright thanks, oh Ross could you stop by the coffee house and get me a muffin?
Honey, come on! You live far away! You're not related. You lift right out.
I did it! Oh! I finished it! I did it all by myself! And there's nobody to hug!
Oh, you're not gonna tell the whole story about how your parents got divorced again are you?
Come on Ross! You said you wanted to talk about it, let's talk about it!! How was she?
Look-look-look-look-look, my first pay check! Look at the window, there's my name! Hi, me!
Well, when we first met, you know, I thought you were pompous and arrogant and obnoxious ...
No, you know what, it's late, everything's gonna be closed. Why don't we just do it another night?
All right Paul, I'm not asking for a lot here. Okay? Just give me something. Anything!
Oh yeah! Hopefully across the street if certain Dutch people would just let go.
No, but they stuck me in personal shopping. Which is just a huge step down!
Ross is on a date with my sister and they shut the drapes two and a-half-hours ago.
Yeah that's great. But first, wait, talk to me, talk to me. Tell me about your day.
Well, uh, I-I don't know. See when-when you put it that way y'know it does sort of...
Oh yeah. There is a plan! Why don't I just start taking my smart pills now?
For Stella! Remember? She's gettin' her grove back in like 20 minutes.
Oh, hi! I would check your hand but... I'm sure you don't want to get my chicken disease!
I loved the moment when you first saw the giant dog shadow all over the park.
Okay. Uh, well can we, can we get you anything Mr. Zelner? Maybe some chocolates?
Well, someone that has his own tux, or has the ability to rent a tux.
Uh, I'm just, I'm just looking out your window. At-at the view. What are you guys doing?
Why? Is he? He is! Isn't he? He's dating that slut in marketing!
Well, I assume I'll have to take showers with him, but y'know, that's true of any job.
You're supposed to realize that they are adults! And that they can make their own decisions.
Because it's Richard's son! It's like inviting Greek tragedy over for dinner!
Yeah, sure. Umm, they didn't have poppy seed bagels, so I... Oh my word!
Oh, I have to go pee. Apparently this baby thinks that my bladder is a squeeze toy.
: Really? : Sure, we have scones left! : OK, read them to me.
Yeah! I'm a big fan! Of the movies, you know. Motion pictures. The Talkies!
Hey Pheebs, I'm-I'm taking Charlie shopping, why don't you come and I'll help you find something.
Oh, great! Well, then I'm gonna take Emma to see him. I wonder why Ross said that he died.
Yeah, so what is she, like a... like a spokesmodel, or an aerobics instructor, what?
Monica! I couldn't find him for two hours! He was having sex with Amy Welch!
Well, how can you be a tour guide, don't you have to be a dinosaur expert or something?
Thank you. Now are you sure? Because once I make a copy, there's no turning back.
Oh my God, Phoebe, Pottery Barn has ripped off the design of our antique!
Okay, y'know what? Maybe, this is not about seizing stuff. Maybe this is about escaping stuff.
Ok, so Phoebe, now are you gonna call your dad and let him know that his dog is ok?
This was such a huge mistake. I can't tell him Phoebe. I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't...
I didn't uh, really have time to read this part of the books, but do you think we have time to...
No, not really. You're pressing the baby into my bladder and now I have to pee. Sorry.
I don't know, I'd leave it on the changing table? What?! What'd I do? What'd I do?!
Ok, everybody, let's give a uh nice warm Central Perk welcome to--
Oh, Monica made me send her to my mother's. Apparently babies and weddings don't mix.
Ross, tonight was about the two of you getting along. Oh, would you just see my chiropractor, already.
Airport, airport. Ross, not alone, Julie, arm around her. Cramp, cramp.
Oh no, you guys, just stay here, I'm gonna go check her diaper, Pheebs you wanna come?
Yeah, but umm... Yes, but, Fonzie was already cool, so he wasn't hurt, right?
Or maybe you would see me looking embarrassed because you are talking on the phone with your crotch!
Yeah, but she also invited you and Ross. Yeah, honey, I'm sorry, but I don't think that was a romantic thing.
What, so you go over there, you tell him you think he's cute, what's the worst that could happen?
I got the tickets! I got the tickets! Five hours from now, shoop, shoop, shoop.
What are you talking about?! Mindy, the guy is the devil! He's Satan in a smock!
Oh so you know that, you guys talked about that, so you get along, so you think you're gonna go out?
All right. Let's say I had slept with Mark. Would you have been able to forgive me?
Well is it fair that all you did was put on a cape and I gotta give you free stuff?
Oh God, ohh, okay, y'know what, do you think ah, do you think that you just forget that I told you this?
Well, so then what are you doing to me? Okay? Just get out of here! All right? Move on!
No! Wait! No, no. Don't do that! That's going to make them think they can come over here.
Oh please, he'll be with his real family, the twins and little miss new boobs.
Oh not-not so much. Umm, what-what do you, what do you mean is there something wrong with Ross?
You guys, there's a little girl in Soho looking for this cat. I mean, you know what that means?!
Well, he makes t-shirts for a living, and he thought it would be appropriate to give me this.
Well, actually, I meant for me. The hiring committee is meeting people all day and...
Ross said my name up there, I mean, come on, I just can't pretend that didn't happen can I?
There, well, see? Barry wouldn't even kiss me on a miniature golf course.
Chandler, this is not addressed to you. This is addressed to Mrs. Braverman downstairs. Thief.
Hit me. Hit me. Hit me. Hit me. Hit me. Hit me. Hit me.
Ohh, I'm gonna have to get over it. God, see I didn't know that's I had to do, I just have to get over it.
Okay, Pheebs, can I ask? So, hes going out with her. I mean, is it really so terrible?
Nooo! Nooooo! You lent me Monica's earrings?! I'm not allowed to borrow her stuff!
So you know, I...I handed in that marketing report and I never got to hear what you thought.
Yeah, it is. Yeah, you know, it's tough. Single mom, career... You gotta get out there.
Well, I-I know you can do that too. I'm just, I'm just saying if you need somebody to talk to... Hi!
Well, maybe that's my decision. Well, maybe I don't need your money. Wait!! Wait, I said maybe!!
Here, kitty-kitty. Here kitty-kitty. Where did you go, little kitty-kitty-kitty? Here kitty-kitty-kitty-kitty...
Well, he's coming from Jersey, he said he would get here as fast as he could!
Well, let's see. There was a really big guy that I was talking to, with the really nice breasts...
Hey! Hey! Hi! Hey-hey-hey, I'm Rachel! From upstairs? The ones with all the pizza?
I did!! I watched! I watched! I watched Monica bang his head against that thing!
Everything's ruined. My bed. My clothes. Look at my favorite blue sweater.
Oh, hi. I have a massage appointment under Rachel Green, and here is my gift certificate.
Oh, my, God, c'mon, you guys! He's gonna be home any minute! He's gonna kill me!
Ok, Paulo, why don't you just go get dressed, and then you be on your way, ok, bye-bye.
Oh Gunther! You brought candy! Thank you so much for picking this up! You are so sweet.
Ok, Ross, what's going on here, are we just bringing strange women back to the apartment now?
Okay, wow, wow, wow. Watch the tongue people, we've got a baby over here.
Are you kidding? I'm trained for nothing! I was laughed out of twelve interviews today.
You want me to just call him up and tell him that you're seeing him instead? That's what you want?
Ooh, Phoebe's here! Okay, let's turn out all the lights and we'll just watch the movie!
Ok, Pheebs, you know what, if we had that, we wouldn't be doing the ritual in the first place.
So Joey I just hooked Ross and Chandler up with some tuxedos for the wedding, do you need one?
Oh no, I know I couldn't see it either at first, but it's right umm... Ross, I lost it again.
Oh, I just remembered. We do have something to eat. Monica put something in our oven this morning.
Hmm, mild discomfort. So I take it you've had one of these Braxton thingies?
Whoa! Y'know what Katie? I gotta tell ya I-I-I-I think you are the one who is too much.
I'm serious, I really, I think I need just to have some...meaningless, sex y'know, with the next guy that I see.
No. Yeah, and I know that. All right, well thank you so much for coming in it was nice to meet you.
Well, I never thought I'd say this, but I'm gonna go use Ugly Naked Guy's bathroom.
Maybe it's not as bad as I think. Y'know, maybe they didn't take it the way I meant it.
All right, all right, all right. Last night, I had a dream that, uh, you and I, were...
I just can't believe this! I mean, with the holidays coming up- I wanted him to meet my family-
Oh, come on! Saran Wrap on the toilet seat, you don't think that's just a little funny?!
Honey, honey, I'm sorry, I know it's our anniversary but I told you on the phone I don't have time to stop.
Oh God, come on you guys, is this really necessary? I mean, I can stop charging anytime I want.
Ugh!!! Well, the apartment is already subletted! I mean, this is just hopeless. I'm never gonna find anything.
Wow! I can't believe they didn't put it in the part where you said you didn't watch soap operas.
Can you not look at me when I say this? I thought that if I could get you here, I could seduce you.
Y'guys ever heard the story about when Rosses mom went to the beauty salon?
Okay, okay. Umm, well ah, maybe he, maybe he feels awkward because you are my boss.
Eight weeks. I mean I love my mother, but my God, a long lunch with her is taxing.
Oh, The Velveteen Rabbit! Oh my God, when the boy's love makes the rabbit real!
Oh it does, it does! It is a room separating apparatus from Colonial times.
Should I be concerned that a button fell off the old Hugsy and I can't find it?
Nooo Way! The most romantic song ever is The Way We Were.
Thanks! I've been here about six years, and Rachel moved in a few months ago.
Ross, um, don't forget to get a shot of Emma's cake. It's in a box in the fridge.
Oh, alright. The weirdest place would have to be... ... oh, the foot of the bed.
Okay. Wow! So I get to see what Joey Tribbiani is like on a date. So do you have any moves?
Okay! No accountants. Oh, and no one from like legal. I don't like guys with boring jobs.
All right, well, if you must know... I had a traumatic... swing incident... when I was little.
Well, not myself, but I know other people that have. Ok, you caught me. I'm a laundry virgin.
Alright, now I really have to go. Okay. Au revoir! Oh, they're gonna really hate me over there.
You know, when two people have a connection, you know, that's... just seems like such a... waste.
Oh, really, really good. But enough about me, come on! Where-where are you from? What do you do?
No! No, of course not. No. That's why I brought it up. They didn't have any sodas?
I'm sorry, as I was saying the store number is wrong, and I'm sorry but that's... Oh my God!!
No, wait. No there's gotta be something else that you can do. I mean, what skills do you have?
Okay. Well that's pretty much all that we have-Oh! Oh! Have you ever had a virgin margarita?
I can't let him go out that way, he's got a meeting. You've got something here on your back.
Oh no! I took one of Ross' bags by mistake, and one of mine is missing.
Hi! Sorry- sorry we're late, we, uh, kinda just, y'know, lost track of time.
I'm not paying for half of that! I'm only staying here until my apartment gets fixed.
Right. Was it the, "Please don't show me another picture of a trilobite vibe?"
Well actually thanks, but I think I'm just gonna hang out here tonight. It's been kinda a long day.
Oh, I know, I'm sorry you guys. You're just gonna have to get used to the fact that I will not be dating Ross.
No honey, okay, okay, you wanna know why Ross canceled the date? Because I asked him to.
Come on, I don't really want to be doing this right now. I am carrying a very heavy couch.
Ok, while you "mmm" on it for awhile, I'm gonna go find a place for my new lamp.
I don't know! I mean, maybe that's something to do with the fact that I saw him do a love scene yesterday.
Phoebe, come on, I don't wanna waste it! It would be like throwing away a hundred bucks!
Well I was gonna tell him that I'm-I'm gonna have the baby and he can be as involved as he wants.
Yeah! I don't think you're going to need it though. Okay, check this out. If it's a girl, Rain.
Yeah! That's Phoebe. That's Phoebe. You know, she just wants them all! It's like she's a nympho!
Hah! I found it! I told you I would find it! In your face! You're a different person.
Yeah, my mom got my dad's season tickets in the divorce, so she just gave them to me.
You have not worn that T-shirt since you were 15!! It doesn't even fit you anymore!
Awe! Oh my God! Looks, she's a little dare-devil! Oh, let me push, can I push?
No, no, that's not what we ordered... We ordered a fat-free crust with extra cheese.
Yeah you like totally let him wash his feet in the pool of your inner power.
Yeah I don't think dressing provocatively is going to help me here! Oh my god just please take her.
Okay, now what was that all about? Is it-does it not taste good? Let me try it.
Except that! Oh, hello, Mr. Zelner. We're all ready for our presentation this afternoon.
I just saw Danny getting on the subway with a girl and he had his arm around her.
Oh, c'mon. We'll have, we'll have a big party, and no-one'll know who's with who.
No, come on, I'm totally ok. I don't need you to come! I can totally handle this on my own.
I know, I lied! I didn't want her to think I was a terrible mother! I can't even see my own baby!
One more time from the top... I like big butts and I cannot lie, you other br...
Okay, well keep in mind that by the time you're done, they'll probably be serving dinner.
Ross, what are you talking about? oh! Oh my God! They put my baby's face on a penis!
Oh totally, totally. Y'know it's not that big of deal, we already kinda did it once y'know.
Really?! The Plaza?!! Oh daddy!! Right. Daddy, I need to talk to you. Please, sit down.
No! You guys can't leave yet! You have to stay, we-we got the whole big thing planned!
Julie! Julie, isn't that great? I mean, isn't that just kick- you-in-the-crotch, spit-on-your-neck fantastic?
Okay. Okay fine, y'know what? We will let Ross and Joey decide. Hiiiii, Ross! Sweetie.
Ugh! No more crying! Please! I just dumped one cry baby, I'll dump you too!
Honey, you're not gonna make enough money to help Frank and Alice just by selling knives.
Sure, you know what? Come on, we'll just tell them that there was like a problem with like the "engine".
That is great. Hey, y'know who doesn't have to job hunt? Ross. He works at the university.
You think I trust you with it?! No! We're gonna split it! You take half and I take half!
Well, I do, but you're just gonna have to actually look at this as more of an investment than a cat.
Ok, look you guys, I really don't want to get into this right now. I think it'll just make everyone uncomfortable.
Are you kidding? Eight hours with my mother talking about Atkins? Good luck, Emma!
Yeah, Joey honey, I don't know if this'll mean anything to you but you'll always be pre-approved with us.
But y'know, I never really had anything to worry about. Ross was never very good at the flirting thing.
Well, wait a minute, you're the boss! Why don't you just yell at them? Or, fire them?
...and then they came back from smoking and they had made all of the decisions without me!
All right, y'know what? I-I'm sorry. I will try to tone it down and uh stop yelling.
Well, y'know what though you guys? I really appreciate that but I think I'm just gonna take Sebastian to the charity.
Well y'know what they say, the 23rd time's the charm. Aww, look at you all handsome!
I don't understand! Last time you went out with her you said she was a 'big, dull dud.'
Uh well, I guess I'm not gonna miss the fact that you're never allowed to move the phone pen.
OK, so that's... that's what, two bottles? And yet somehow we went through five?
Oh, Phoebe, are you still on hold? I was supposed to call my Dad back like two hours ago.
Ohh, here you are. I was looking for you before. Joshua's gone so you and Emily are free to go.
Oh god look at her sleeping. Oh, I love her so much! Oh, I think I'm gonna wake her up.
Oh, god, this is great! The plane is gone, so it looks like I'm stuck here with you guys.
Oh god. You've totally messed with the back support of my chair. How do you fix this?
Wha... My resume? I wouldn't... I wouldn't call my online dating profile a resume.
Yeah. So don't move, okay? Just stay here and... maybe close your blinds at night.
Well I assume the ah, happy couple isn't up yet. Did you guys hear them last night?
Well, we're not here to meet guys. You have a boyfriend, I have a b. . . baby and a Ross.
Ugh! Get out! Get out! Go! Come on! No! Not in there! He's in there!
Well maybe he saw your hand slip briefly from the ten and two o'clock position.
Wherever I go. Come on you and me, we'll-we'll start a new group, we're the best ones.
Aww. Well, ok, well that's very nice. And you wrote a card . "From Gavin"
Oh, yeah, ok. Let me just grab my night vision goggles and my stun gun.
In the future, when a girl asks for some ill-advised sympathy sex... just do it.
Wha... forget it Ross, no, I am not gonna stand here and make a list of. . .
Yeah, I know, go long. Y'know, it's like all I'm doing is running back and forth from the huddle.
Uhh, let's just stay clear of 'I'm the guy that's doing you daughter' and you should be ok.
Guys, you're not gonna believe this! I was just saying goodnight to Emma and she said her first words!!
Im okay! Im okay! Mr. Heckles, Mr. Heckles could you help me please?
Oh! See just I'm right back where I started! Aww, this sucks! Being alone, sucks!
Hey, I was doin' great before I found out about you. You think it's easy for me to see you with Julie?
Wow, Ikea... what a rich culture. Uhm, you know what? I have a friend who is a masseuse.
Oh, no, no no. I meant that he's gonna be paying that other woman beause she's a professional.
I think I just shipped 3,000 bras to personnel. Oh honey, I gotta go. Mark, I need you!
Hey, so he stole a couple bucks from me! At least he bought me something with it!
Oh my God! I'm standing at a cash register, holding a credit card, and I'm bored.
I dunno. Y'know to me he'll always be "Jack Geller, walks in while you're changing."
Yeah, I feel kinda bad for them, but I'm also really psyched 'cause I don't have to move in here!
Thank you. Hey-hey umm, uh, is there, is there any such thing as an annulment shower?
Oh, okay. Uhh, well let's see. You're about-well uh, this one is large. And this one-
No! They didn't even talk to each other. God, how was I supposed to know they were having problems?
Mon, if uh you were at lunch alone, how come it cost you uh 53 dollars?
Yes-yes, just a few seconds and she'd still be with us-nothing about an assistant buyer?
Oh Emma. This is going to be your first Thanksgiving. What are you thankful for? Mommy's bobbies.
Well I'm alone and I just bought fifteen dollars worth of candy bars, what do you think?
What? What? He's interested in you. He-he likes your hair, he just wants to know how you got here.
Oh, no-no-no, no-no-no, it has become, it has-yeah. Oh no, those were four great dates.
And your horoscope says, "On the fifth a special someone is going to give you a gift."
Honey, you have nothing to prove. And if you really like this girl, I don't flirting is the right thing to...
Yes, I'm sorry. Do you have any extra pants? Umm, my friend seems to have had a little accident.
Yeah, I'll be fine. But could someone please make sure that sandwich is gone when I get out there?
That's your whole name, okay of course it is! Okay, well let's-let's just have a look-see here.
Oh, well thank you for taking your tongue out of my sister's mouth long enough to tell me that.
Yeah. Just, if it's possible, could you leave him somewhere and go have sex with another guy?
Oh, you're not gonna believe what happened to me today! Ralph Lauren called, and gave me my job back!
There's been a teeny-teeny change in plans. It turns out that I'm not free tonight. So...
I, I didn't say any... I sw... I did not say anything, I swear. He stopped by.
OK, sorry to break up this party, but I've got resumes to fax before work tomorrow...
Uh, I will see you... and I'll raise you. What do you say... want to waste another buck?
Oh, Joey, it's so great to be back here. I gotta tell you, you're making it so easy on me and Emma.
Uh, no. Wait, you know what, this is the outfit that makes my calves look fat. Nevermind.
Ross, I have been walking around like this since the plane! I can-you have so crossed a line.
Yeah.. yeah right.. Remember in high school when I died and didn't give you my baby?
Hi! Just so you know, we-we didn't mean to fog you, we thought you were like a yeti or something.
Wh... So... If neither of you are married by the time you're 40, you're gonna marry Joey.
Joey, I gotta tell ya, I've been thinking all day about that scene you did, I mean, you were amazing!
That's right, I wanna do it with you! I've been trying to fight it, but you just said all the right things.
Well, it wasn't just me, alright? He freaked out too! He couldn't even undo my bra!
Oh yeah, scared the hell out of me. I thought we'd lost you forever. Pheebs, you lie down?
Well, if you see him, will you please tell him that I'm looking for him and that this I am not gonna throw up!
Well, people missed you in there. And in fact, there was actually a request for "Smelly Cat".
Well, he didn't say, but it was a fire. I'm guessing not very good. Come on, we gotta go!
Joey, Emma's right here! You promised not to bring girls home in the middle of the day anymore.
I'm so glad, I'm so glad you shared. And I'm glad that you're done. What do you say we umm...
Forgot my purse! Oh, you guys made up. He's a good kisser isn't he? I'm going!
Let me just get this straight! So I go have a baby and they send some guy in to do my job?
Okay you're right. I'll hire Hilda tomorrow. Dumb old perfect for the job Hilda!
Sweety, I gotta tell ya... it sounds a little bit like you like the apartment more than you like...
No Paul, I don't know anything about you! Y'know, like-like your childhood! Tell me about your childhood!
Oh no, no-no-no, that's not, not, not, what he is doing. He's just, he's just really romantic.
Okay. Umm, well, first I would like to start by apologizing for kissing you and uh, for yelling at you.
Yeah, if you're going to do the ears, you might as well take a pass at the nosal area.
Oh, really, well Ross, you know what? I am a big girl. I don't need someone telling me what is best for me.
Yeah, yeah. Phoebe and I are going to have so much fun. And thank you for watching the baby, by the way.
Do you think it's possible for two friends to fool around and... and not have it be a big deal?
I am not a baby! You know what? I swear to god, just because you get so uptight every time we...
Ok Ross, just so you know, calling it a poopie diaper doesn't make this process any cuter.
Yeah! You and that girl from that copy place, which yesterday you took full responsibility for!!
Well, that shouldn't be a problem. I mean I work in fashion and all I meet are eligible straight men.
Y'know what Tag, if we went down to the office you would see those contracts sitting on your desk.
Oh Joey, I'm so happy things worked out for us that we're having this baby together. I love you so much.
Oh, y'know, it's just like hats, and a shirt, and CD's, just sort of stuff that you've left here.
He didn't turn me down! He's at the game isn't he? I got the date, I'm just not on it!
I know, so do I. Oh Phoebe, I'm so glad you made me do this. OK, lemme se yours.
It kinda worked. I mean y'know, I don't know about you buy I haven't thought about our thing since all this.
Ok, ok, that's fine. Fine. Hey, I'm sorry about that spill before. Only $98.50 to go.
No. Ross: Hey Rach, have you seen Charlie anywhere? Ross: I'm smarter than him!
And remember how you always said you were afraid the landlord would find out and then tear it down?
I can't believe that you yelled at my boss! I'm-I'm gonna lose my job! What am I going to do?!
God, I hope he doesn't show up. Of course he's not gonna show up, the guy hates me.
Oh honey, I'm sorry we can't help you there, 'cause we're cuddlily sleepers. Okay, I'm late for work.
Yeah Melissa, I don't want to be known as the uh, office bitch, but I will call your supervisor.
Great!! It was very, very nice to meet you sir--Ow! Hey! What are you doing?! Are you crazy!
No it's okay, this is what's gonna happen. I'm gonna wait a couple years and then the baby will tell him.
I am feeling nothing. Speaking of hot, watching you do that really makes me want to have sex with you.
Right! But, none of that compared to how kind and-and how gentle and thoughtful he is.
Thanks. God this is so stupid! How could I be upset over something I never had? It's negative?
Uh-uh-uh, right now? Because I've kinda got an el fresco situation going on over here.
"Well, should we just continue to live together and not really tell each other how we're really feeling?"
Okay. Oh, uh, wait a minute, y'know what? I uh, I can't decide this. Umm, okay, just hold on a second.
Oh wait! Y'know what? I can't, I can't look at it. I can't. Somebody else tell me, somebody tell me.
Oh honey, are you jealous of Paolo? Oh, c'mon, I'm so much happier with you than I ever was with him.
No? All right, here's the truth um, Joey said what he said, because um, I'm attracted to you.
I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love- and that'd be it? ..Ross?
Hey, can I borrow the key to your house so I can run across the street and make a copy?
"Pheebs, can't make it, got a date. Talk to you later. Big Daddy." Big Daddy?
Joey, just because they're not getting married doesn't mean this is going to be a disaster. Maybe they have a plan!
I'm just saying that y'know, someday Ross is gonna meet somebody and...he's gonna have his own life. Right?
so basically you've slept with all the woman in New York and now you're just going around again.
Is the window open? Because if there's a window open, a bird could fly in there.
Phoebe, if this guy's going through a divorce, is it such a good idea to start going out with him?
Ohh, OK, OK, OK, well, basically, lately, I've uh, I've uh, sort of had feelings for you.
Monica? You gonna be very proud of me. I just got us dates with two unbelievably cute nurses.
So I was with Joshua for an hour today, and he has not asked me out. It's just so frustrating!
Oh my God! Oh my God! Thank you! That was the fire department, there was a fire at our place!
Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. Maybe it's not so bad. How did you leave it?
Ah, hah-hah-hah-ho, yeah, he wishes. Oh, I'm sorry, look at me. OK, Michael, let's talk about you.
Hi! I got you some coffee. To, uh... ...fair enough. So! Do you got anything for me?
Why not? I don't want to do this alone! And he's such a sweet guy and he loves me so much.
That cute waiter guy from your restaurant, the one that looks like a non-threatening Ray Liotta?
Ross, it is 100 degrees outside. For the first time in weeks, I am somewhat comfortable.
I did the first time! Oh. Oh.. And you know what. You want to know why I'm not giving Emily to you.
Yeah but-but-but you liked me! Oh my God, I can't believe this, all this time, I liked you and you liked me!
Really! God Ross, what were you thinking? I know it's really shallow, but a part of me wants him again.
Oh, it's a tattoo! That's weird, Phoebe doesn't... Wait that's Ursula! That's not Phoebe that is Ursula!
You know what? I don't want to be with them either, but it's Thanksgiving and we should not want to be together, together.
Oh sorry didn't mean to interrupt. It's just such a beautiful space; do you do a lot of weddings here?
All right, let's get this party started, huh? Joey and Phoebe are gonna perform a little something for us.
Emmm. Now, instead of the vegetables, is there anyway I can substitute the three-pound lobster?
Oh, I know. Hey, y'know what we never did? Oh no, not that. We uh, we never had bonus night!
I'm sorry, what did you just say? Did you just say hi? Oh my God, Ross, Ross, Ben just said 'Hi'.
Oh hey you. Thanks for coming out of me. I know. Oh. Yeah. Oh, she's looking at me. Hi! I know you.
Mon, honey you're not dying. I'm just moving out. Y'know, I mean we're gonna see each other all the time.
Oh my God! Listen to you talkin' about having kids. Oh my Joey. Oh, please don't get married before I do.
well, now, wait a second, who did I just put as my "In case of emergency" person?
So why don't you just let me worry about making the trifle and you just worry about eating it, alright?
Hey... Hi you guys! Listen, you know what? I'm not feeling really well. I think I can't get out for the play.
So Ross, we went out for two years, and you never told me you were in an I Hate Rachel club.
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry, but I need to get off the plane, okay? I need to tell someone that I love love them.
Well, she-she ob-obviously saw the tire tracks that were leading up to the closed garage.
I don't know... maybe it's because she has got such callousy fingers from playing crummy guitar...
Hmm. Do you think-Could you tell me if she's hanging in, in a one bedroom or a two?
I mean I'm probably 98% happy, maybe 2% jealous. And I mean what's 2%? That's nothing.
Phoebe the father is not here okay? I haven't told him yet and I don't think I can tell him at all now!
Are you serious?! Chandler, we ate an entire cheesecake two days ago and you want more?
Yeah, I did, but y'know what? I am really, really trying to cut back, y'know? Good luck, Rach.

See, Gavin, you're capable of being a nice guy. Why did you give me such a hard time?
No! I do not care what my hormones are doing, I am not going to just do it with some random guy!
So would I. You wouldn't think that Annie Liebawitz would forget to put film in the camera.
Oh my God! You guys this is so great! I mean it's so unexpected! I mean Chandler's birthday is even before mine!
Ok. So now, I think Emma is probably down for the night, but if you need anything Ross . . .
