Yeah, what the hell did I know!
It's so secluded up here.
Something to do with numbers?
Yeah, otherwise I'm not going.
Oh, I gotta go back in there.
You're never leaving the apartment!
Hey! Is Ross still here?
No-no, it's really not huge.
Uh, I'm holding Ben.
All right fine, I pick you.
Oh, you're welcome a million.
Yeah, okay, I'll see you later.
Because I lose her stuff!
Oh my God. And that works?!
But only if it's a girl.
Joey, we're not keeping this!
Ha, I made you look....
How is it going with Charlie?
That was kind of rude!
Oh. It's gotta be rough.
But Joey you don't have $20,000!
The bll is drrbing!
Mrs., Mrs. Gobb?
Ewww, is that what that is?
Oh God, you saw me?! Oh!
Well, I'd have to say gay.
Well now what's the rush?
OK, well, bye-bye again.
Yeah, I forget which ones.
Well, I thought you liked doing it.
It was an amazing night.
Oh yeah, good start Mon.
Ow, you stop flicking.
Joey! We should just switch.
Oh, you-you mean your earrings?
This is just occurring to you?
Are you gonna let me play?
Could I get some peanuts?
Oh, that's great. Look at that.
...medium...hmm...any cookies left?
Huh, Bob Saget?
Ohh, well, this is just perfect!
Good, you guys are all here!
He carries a briefcase.
What?! You say that to kids?!!
Phoebe! You can't do th...
Oh, no no no no no.
Who are you supposed to be?
Aah... I bet you're right.
Yeah Phoebe, I completely understand.
I think he's across the hall.
What college was that Dina?
Just washing the windshield.
Because! Because I was sad.
Oh what do you know? Virgin!
My God! What happened to you?
Say hi to Wally.
Thank you. Thank you. I love you.
Go on! Go on.
What do you, what do you mean?
...I mean it's my fault.
Oh, howd she take it?
OK, OK, it's my turn.
Aw, honey, that's so sweet.
Well, it was all Ross's idea.
Wow that was a big one.
What? Yeti-I mean Danny?
Thank you. So are we good?
What?! You got us evicted!!
Uh, to Stephanie Schiffer.
Oh, I think I saw some in here.
Oh, look, wish me luck!
Ross! Stop it! Come on!
Amazingly, that makes sense.
"Oh, my, god."
Hey! Hey what's going on?
I didn't know there were docks.
Excuse me. It's about the job.
Oh... Oh boy... Hi...
I don't want you to see me naked!
Well... Umm, I got TiVo.
No, you wait! This is ridiculous!
Yeah. A year ago..
Ok, so let's talk money.
I don't know where the phone is.
Oh wow, this feels weird.
Honey that sounds like fun.
Wow! I did not see that coming.
Joey asked me marry him.
Wow, you guys, this is big.
Is he romantic with her?
That-that you came on to me?
Oh yeah? Since when?
Hi, this is my friend Rachel.
It's a uh, regatta gala.
Ohh, and the nicest girlfriend!
Does anybody need anything?
Oh! What's new in sex?
Oh. Right. ...Oh great.
No Joe, no miracle.
Probably just the first half.
Oh honey, but it is just about...
No! I'm so happy for them!
Ross, why didn't you tell me that?
Awww, just like his daddy.
Yeah, Phoebe you're... awful!
Nothing. I don't want to do anything.
Why?! What?! Are you kidding?!
Ross, you're like my best friend.
What?! She made the tea!
Oh! I knew it! What happened?
Then what? What do you want?
We won. We won!
Ohhhh, sorry I missed that.
Have you been working out?
Well no, I don't smell anything.
4 o'clock. Food?
Huh ha ha!
Her dancer friends?
Three of your five, what?
Oh! Molly! You're not Ross.
I'm fantastic. You remember Ross?
Did you just break the radiator?
All right Ross!! I get it!!
Wha. . . hey!
Well, h-how is this like that?
Joey! Come here! Come here!
Well try to keep it down.
Thank you...we're so excited!
Oh my God! That is so good!
Ugh. Wait, wait, wait.
Say more things like that.
Yeah, that's probably a good idea.
Oh, he's just goofing around.
Well, then can we meet him?
Hello? Oh, Pheebs! It's Phoebe!
Ooooh! Wow!! Oh, hi.
You are soo enjoying this.
Chandler, you have an assistant right?
Okay, should we get some coffee?
Oh stupid metric system!
Oh. Oh my God, is that Phoebe?
We're paying for this y'know.
I'm just going to grab the phone.
Not uh, not to my recollection.
Let me see that. Oh, yeah.
What are you, what are you doin'?
Monica's gonna marry a millionaire!!!
Ooh, your brother. Score!
Okay, I'm done. Do mine.
Do I have my own castle?
You want me to see a therapist?
He's not having an affair!
Hey he's wearing a sweater.
Yeah, I'm not talking about her...
Well, I would like to have the option!!
"Yeah." "Me neither."
"Yeah." "Me too."
She-she died Jill.
Fine! We'll ask Phoebe.
Well then I can't tell you what I know.
Hey, I thought that guy was married.
Yeah, these are pretty ch-ching.
All right. Hey-hey-hey!! Sandwiches!
I couldn't be inner. Monica?
Where the hell've you been?
Well, y'know, sometimes that helps.
She asked-asked you out again?
Huh.. How about 600?
So what are you guys going to do?
Oh please, they're having sex.
God I'm just a horrible person.
Wel-wel-well what are we gonna do?
Well, I-I'm startin' too.
We'll be right back sir.
Because he's stealing from me!
I know, I still need to talk to you.
Do you wanna play football?
Okay, don't listen to him. Please?
Oh so-so not really never.
Hey, c'mon, cut it out.
All right!! Fine! Fine.
She you in the parking lot.
Ohhhh, I cannot look at it!
I'm-I'm sorry, I just thought that...
What thing? What is this thing?
Come on! I think this is funny!
It's open! Hi, Joe!
I'm sorry. I'm done. I'm done.
Ohh, I'm gonna be on the news!
Ohh-Do you think he will?!
Did-did you take these back?
Wow! This place is fabulous!
Oh yeah. That's a great story.
So, uh, how was your day?
So you know how to fix it?
How do you know about that story?!
Okay fine, what do you have?
Emma! See? I don't want it.
You put these on my desk!
Hey! Hi, how's my girl?
I KNOW!! I KNOW!! I KNOW!
We have to get her a present?!
Oh my god. Janice, hi!
Aww, look at the little thing.
Yeah, 15 hundred dollars.
Oh and I'll call ya too!
So now what have we agreed?
Because I knew you were lying!
Um, Mon, Chandler's not here.
God, Monica it's on the ceiling.
And um, what-what is that Ross?
Well, you were pretty damn good.
Yeah, that was a real good one.
Oh-oh! Okay, she's kicking!
Really?! Oh my God! I'm successful!
Hey Joey, what 'cha doing?
You remember when we got these?
Okay, I'll see you after the thing.
What song was that, Pheebs?
Well yeah, sure, what's up?
Oh, sorry, it's my phone. Hello?
OK, then get me your purse.
You give me back my Walkman!
I, uh, think you already are.
Ross, please, I found the magazines!
IF you hold a spider.
Monica, will-will you marry me?
Oh, well okay. Well, there you go.
What? You really think she's hot?
Really it's nothing. I'm just...
You guys wanna get some coffee?
Whoa, how do you know about that?
Yeah, Monica's settin' me up.
Oh yeah. That makes sense.
Why the hell didn't you tell me!
Third one from the left?
How did it go with Erin?
Not even one more time?
Yeah, yeah I like him a lot.
Okay, umm, I'm gonna get my sweater.
Eh. Beth dies.
AND YOU KNOW!!!
Oh my God! You look so beautiful!
Hi! Oh you guys look so beautiful!
Hey Ross! I brought reinforcements.
I don't really care about the Knicks.
What is this? Ross, what is this?
Wait, I-I just said "leave."
But we should move quick.
Oh no, I can't. I got a date.
Aw. Hey, Pheebs, want this?
Oh my God! Oh, I cannot believe it!
Oh really? Like what Monica?
Umm, can I use your bathroom?
Here comes another contraction.
No, I stuff outside the bra.
Ohh, I mean it's just so realistic!
Awww, awww, it's beautiful.
That is the Coast Guard.
What did, what did he say?
Hi. Ohhh, you got my message.
No, I think that was the whole all.
You were gonna drink the fat.
Oh my God Monica, who is that?
I just, I feel, I-I just...
You stole them from me!!
Ross, my father doesn't hate you.
Yeah, we're gonna let you be alone.
No so we're protecting her.
Oh come on, I already went.
So I'm thinking about you. So what?
Oh, Phoebe, do I wanna hear this?
I said it's still nap time.
Let's dry 'em again.
Oh yeah, she can't be herself.
No. A break from us.
You mean the one that you're wearing?
Ohh, I like swimmer's bodies!
Joey! I can't believe you just did that!
You let Joey drive it?!
Okay, well, we won that one.
I didn't know you could get married here.
But Pheebs, y'know you earned it.
I just don't want to be alone tonight.
Thank you. Okay, twenty dollars.
Joey, you have got to take this back!
Ooh, ooh, ooh,ooh,ooh. Hi.
Oh no! Not me! Emma!
So now, what are you doing here?
Whoa-whoa-whoa, let's say more!
Oh my God, I gotta go to work!
What is this? What are we doing?
You're out of Diet Coke.
You're out of toilet paper!
What-what are-what are these?
It's a pretty cool tux.
Monica, where did you get these?!
Ok. If you really need to.
Oh, oh. . What is this?
No, was he any good in it?
And... taped back together.
Alright! Enough out of you!
I want the little round waffles.
Oh, look at her, so happy!
Yeah!!! Kill 'um!!!
Well why didn't you take the job?
I can't... I can't hear it again.
Turned out it was a hat.
I can't. Please, you do it for me.
I meant, me plus one!
How'd it go with Pete?!
Yeah well, I'm-I'm a slut.
It's worse than the thumb!
Take it like a man, Ross!
Hi Joey, how ya doin'?
Well, y'know what, that doesn't matter.
Oh God, I really had a good time!
Oh, God, he's such a pig,
So maybe something in an office.
You've being seeing someone?
OK, I'm doin' it for ya.
Well, look at that, same thing.
Oh no. No Ross, don't do this.
Okay. Oh, yeah... Oh he's cute!
It'll be a short one.
So Pheebs, pick one of them.
About an hour ago.
Hey Joey, can I ask you something?
I think it could be kind of great!
Oh, yeah. Definitely you, Pheebs.
Ugh, Monica, I know about you and Chandler.
Oh wow. Are you in trouble.
No, yeah, Ive done that.
Okay. I'm sorry. You're right, you're right.
Why aren't you home yet?!
I don't get this! She was horrible!
Really? You think that's all it is?
I don't care, I'm not going anywhere.
Pretty uhm, different huh?
Happy New Year, Joey!
Ross, I am a human doodle!!
You dont even have cats.
No, it was just the three of us.
Did you just say Hi, Jew?
Well relax, he'll be here.
Men just take out wind?
Why would I have to sleep with you?
No-no-no, that' not Joshua.
You mean, you mean 30 days?
Ooh great! Very Monica.
Excuse me, there was no time!
What're you guys doing out here?
Okay. Okay, see? I get the phone.
Well, what-what 'cha got there?
That proposal, at the planetarium...
Ross, it's okay. You can come out.
Wow! I don't know, maybe. I'm...
What? I was just trying to teach you.
Would anybody like more coffee?
Oh, gosh, it's hot in here.
Yeah, I do. I-I do, do that.
Hi! Wow! You look, you look...big.
Well, we never actually got to dinner.
Sure we should... So.
Bloomingdale's eliminated my department.
Oh, please, you wanted to get caught.
It's not random, it's Bob.
Joey, how do you make that dirty?
Isn't that a kind of sushi?
Yeah, well, I gotta work, I'm sorry.
I'm gonna need a copy of those.
I don't know...right, he's the pig!
Ross, what is taking you so long?
I'm sorry honey, what were you saying?
Yeah, it couldn't hurt to look.
Can any of you watch Emma?
Heey man, I work out.
Oh! My hero! What happened?
No, you could've lost your job.
Op, I like credit cards!
We can't. We're not pharmacists!
No, you know what, I think you should go.
We got some really great stuff!
Well, I didn't know what else to do!
Ohhh! That is soo sweet!
Well then I demand a recount!
You are having a party tonight??
Chandler!! Are you gonna call her!
Hi! You're back from your date!
How often do you read it?
Oh, wow, Molly is just great!
All right, all right. Let's go!
Oh. Amy! Happy Thanksgiving.
Oh God. Is she gonna be okay?
Wh--Why don't I tell you over here?
Uhh, the mailman, the super.
Are you breaking up with us?
What? Oh my God! To who?
Well, can I talk to you for a sec?
Anybody wanna trade? Oh...
Because, uh-it has to.
Are you okay? You're not blinking.
Ohh, Phoebe, what am I going to do?
Yeah! No that's what I was thinking.
Oh... what an interesting name.
Which one do you think she is?
Oh, not much. I-I got a job.
You want me to talk you out of it?
Whoa! Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Oh, I can not believe you didn't tell me!
Well, get back in there and talk!
I - I have to get on the plane.
Hey, Ross!!! I told you I don't!
Oh my gosh. Wow, so beautiful.
Oh god. I think I'm gonna be sick.
All right, it won't come off!
Okay, bla-bla-bla-bla!! Who is it?!
You're a pathetic loser, right?
Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks!
How is that the silver lining?
Wow! I can't believe you lied to me.
Sorry, I thought you were talking to me.
Yeah, right away Mr. Kaplan.
Uhh... I think I just got engaged.
Oh no, no, I'll be there too.
Ah, all right. Here's to Ross!
She didn't hang up either!
Wh-You dated my sister!
Ohhh, I-I would enjoy that!
Ohh, of course Monica's brother!
Oh my God! The millionaire's here!
We love you, we're here for you.
I'm gonna marry someone good y'know.
Op, ice. I need ice.
Joey, did you my face cream?
That's because he's on your neck.
I am so hot for you right now.
I can too eat by myself!
Phoebe, I mean, you do know he's married?
Shake that nasty butt...
I do. I really do. I don't know anything.
You-you're not wearing a jacket.
Yeah, I guess Gunther is kinda...
She dropped off a casserole?
Oh you guys thanks for doing this.
Why did you invite my mother?!
All right, I'll see you guys later.
I don't know... sometimes it doesn't.
I did not know you spoke French.
Oh yeah. All right, back to work.
I don't care about any of that!!
Oh. Here's your moisturiser. Hi!
Well, that's because of a lot of...
No! No-no, I love it. Thank you.
Ok honey, you really need a job.
No you really think that's what it is?
Okay, well then bring her in.
Whatever! Okay, I'm not your mother.
Hey, how'd the interview go?
Well, I-I could live without it.
Okay, Ross, it has to be realistic.
Oh, great, Are you gonna be ok?
Oh... Oh my God. He remembered.
Oh wow! Look at this place!
Were both of those Joey?
Does anybody want anything else?
Can somebody please go in?
Oh my God. Did you talk to him?
Ohh! Thank God! Where was it?
Hey, Mon, you want some help?
Well, I was gonna let you play with it.
Really, I shouldn't feel guilty?
Mon, honey, I gotta ask you something.
Joey, you are not! You're 31.
Well we're gonna miss you around here.
You're just staring into space.
What? What!?! You kissed him?
Oh, did you not want people to know that?
Ok professor or detective?
Well look, if you don't like this...
Well, honey that was pretty obvious.
Oh, I read that in high school.
Well tell us! What are they?
What?! No! I'm not gonna move out!
Then what's with all the bananas?
Yeah well unless we tell him.
Okay, but Ross just listen to me...
Would you excuse me for a second?
Ok Monica: We will!!
No. I was just going to do this myself.
Oh okay, I see what you're doing there.
You are ready to make a commitment!
Wow! I can't believe that's our baby.
High-five, the babies are coming!
Come on, just answer the question!
No its really okay... Monica!
I know, I know. I went a little crazy.
Not even with your best friend.
Wow. She does that a lot!
Jurassic Park could happen.
Okay Monica, did you know about this?!
Yeah, honey, they wouldn't miss this.
Yeah, no. Ross has a PhD.
Well, congratulations, so do you love her?
Okay. What?! What are you doing here?!
You really think it would be that different?
Okay, y'know what? Maybe I should go!
I've never lived like this before.
Never happened! Good night!
Okay! All right! How was she?
I could not have done this without you.
No, I don't think we'll be doing that.
No, Phoebs. I'm dating Russ.
Well, I brought the next best thing.
Time is money my friend?
Ross, can you pass me the yams?
Wow. There it is, I see it.
Oh! Oh my God! What did I just do?
Well, we are ready to try anything.
Oh. Yes! I would so move out!
Phoebe hates Pottery Barn?!
Actually, I just wanna talk to Tag.
Ahh... Chandler's on the couch!!
It was only 500 bucks.
Chandler, can you give us a minute?
Hi Joey! What are you doing here?
You went shopping for fur?
All right. I'm a total pro!
Really? But I'm being so unreasonable.
Uhh, we still need a tip.
Noo! Maybe! I, I don't know.
Oh, don't be such a baby! end.
Does anybody need more coffee?
Bye. What a manipulative bitch.
You just did a little dancy thing.
...It's kinda hard though!
Oh Phoebe, I'm so happy for you honey.
Oh well, you don't want to do that now?!
Uh Ross? You asked me that.
And all these people actually died?
No! You gotta hold my hand!!
What? Did her ass explode?!
And Monica, what are you going to make?
Why? Honey, what is the big deal?
Oh please, you inhale your food!
Really?! So this has happened to you?
Okay, no uterus, no opinion.
How have you never been on Oprah?
And your fly's still open...
Oh, you're not having fun, are you?
Okay, even this is turning me on!
Okay, y'know maybe I should come back...
So did you break up with Joanna?
Okay! All right, pick a half.
Noo! I wish! Okay, you ready?
Oh, please, miss, you don't understand!
All right, so we weren't prepared!
Why aren't you guys at the movie?
Oh my God, he dream-cheated on you!
God. You seem really, really nice.
Oh, God! Please, somebody say something.
Oh my...God! Let me see that!
No, I know! I get it! It's funny!
has your girlfriend got the butt?
All right, straight, and not subtle.
Well, then so you just invite me...!
Oh! Screw it, I didn't get it!
Oh, that's very-Really very-very okay.
It depends on who asked.
But Ross, you want the name Ruth!
Well y'know, I don't want you to be cold.
Fine! I'm sorry for your loss!
And you are a very funny clown.
Nah, uh, uh, uh, uh.
Well, yeah! I'm still pursuing that.
I hope you're going somewhere with this.
Monica! I'm not gonna screw it up!
Thank you. Hello? I still don't get it.
Oh, you bought me a present! Why?
You all know? Does Ross know?
Any sign of your brother?
Well what is it? Let me see.
Oh! Phoebe, all babies are beautiful!
Because I promised Mindy I would.
Ohh, big, fat bummerrr.
I got a touchdown! We did it!!
He got it a flea market!
No! God, would you just calm down!
But he has to know how I feel!
Wow, he must like you the best.
Oh, it's just an anti-theft device.
Yeah! Remember I got that uh, gala.
What...how is it going with Drake?
Hey, you.... So, what's up?
Ye-, no, my Uncle Hi.
Oh, it's perfect! But not for tonight.
Ugh, I just gotta get the thing back!
Yeah, okay, at ease solider!
Right, I'll see you guys later...
Well, maybe you didn't want it to end?
But I told you, I didn't have the time!
I get to hire my own assistant!
I'd do anything for you, you know that.
You're fly is open, Geller!
Well don't you have that big date tonight?
OK, I'm guessing this is from...
What? You don't want me to get a job?
Oh yeah! You really-You look great.
Oh, yeah, I'm not, I'm not hungry.
Well, my eye is a little itchy.
Well,sounds like you two have issues.
SSSHHHHTTT!!He's asking her a question!!
Could you please get her attention?
Oh my God! What does that thing do?
Oh. Oh, it's beautiful. I see it now.
Are you makin' him a sandwich?
Hi! All right, let's go shoppin'!!
Oh c'mon Joey, we care about you.
What, the blonde with no bra?
Really? It doesn't seem desperate?
So who else was in this club?
You know it was you're uhm... birthday...
Oh, stop that, stop that right now.
All right are you guys gonna come down?
Oh, no, no. That is a doll.
I'm on the phone! Dr. Wiener?
Oh yes, of course, I remember him!
Geez Ross, you could have showered.
Oh my God! Really?! Can I see it?
Okay, go to the left. The left!
Okay, you guys, just relax. I doooo.
Ball? There is no ball.
: We have apple cinnamon...
Pheebs? Could you get that? Please?
Oh, no sit-ups today Tag?
Why-why aren't you more excited?
Oh, I'm not doing it alone. I have Ross.
Umm... I'm never gonna getting married!
Hi! Tag. What are you doing here?
And that's Phoebe , and that's Joey.
Look at it, isn't it beautiful?
Down at the docks again?
And a crappy New Year.
Great set tonight Phoebs.
So, did you shave your legs?
No! Wait! Wait-wait! Ross, please!
No matter how much we want it.
I don't even know how I would go about it.
I know, I can do more than cook.
I want to tell you to have a good honeymoon!
Ross, it just wouldn't have been feasible.
Let us keep the apartment and...
Uh. Did you call your parents?
Well, apparently he scares easy.
Was that all you wanted to ask me?
Vrrbddy, the bll is drrbing.
Good! I'm glad it's not a problem.
Yeah but, he's not your type.
Time's up, now your dead.
Yeah do it now, call right now.
Of course, I'd be honored!
So, is this just gonna be you and Carol?
Oh honey he doesn't need my help.
Okay! I got the keys! Okay! Okay!
Phoebe, honey, wanna get some breakfast?
Get out, get out of my apartment.
Okay, okay, okay should I be scared?
So how's it goin' with Joey?
She won a thousand dollars!
So it would just be, me alone?
Foot rubs for a month!
I don't know! Maybe they have tools.
Oh my God you stole her award!
Yeah. You're not gonna end up alone.
So you eh, you talked to Joey?
Nah, I don't really want her to see.
Well, I'm sorry, I thought you needed them!
Well it stupid, unfair question!
Okay! So, we'll just stay married.
Oh, you poor little famous man.
No-no, they're not very nice people.
What? Oh, I'm sorry, I can't, I'm busy.
Oh tomorrow, oh I don't know. Um...
Chandler, there's a guy right over there.
He doesn't speak much English.
There's no room under the bed.
That's a line from the show too!
Hey, Mom? Having fun?
Come on, they were not that huge.
No! If there was I wouldn't tell you.
And that makes you angry because...
You didn't break up with that fireman?
Yeah and there's really cute guys there.
Hey, that was an honest mistake!
How long do cats live?
Okay, just give me the damn drops!
Oo! When's her birthday?!
Uuuh!! How about at a Footlocker?
Oh! I would love to read a poem.
Wow! I can't, I can't feel my hands.
"Dude, Where's My Car?"
Yeah honey you don't believe her do you?
Off to see young Ethan?
Honey, Monica, this is ridiculous! Look...
Yeah. Why? Is that weird for you?
Are-are you saying he's a geek?
Oh, I'm sorry! Do you need the phone?
Good day for married people huh?
No, we kinda broke up instead.
Oh, it's so much more fun with you.
And stop saying that! I hate that!
You are asking me to be your wife!
It's over! You have to accept that.
Uh, it was very nice meeting you.
Yeah that's actually a pretty good idea.
Shoot. Oh, I can't believe I did this!
How come you didn't come over earlier?
Ooh, good God, they're so yummy!
Ugh, those bastards! Let's go.
How can you not remember us kissing?!
Hi Tag! What are you doing here?
Okay, y'know what? I'll-I'll have toast!
Well y'know, we did other stuff too.
Hey, who's this little naked guy?
Joey has got a secret peephole!
Yeah, he's back. Is that a problem?
I knew it! I knew it, ahh....
I got a really incredible job offer.
Yeah, but, there were no suds.
All right, I'm gonna make more margaritas!
Oh! I do not have chubby ankles!
Ross, you had sex with another woman!
Okay, I need a, I need a drink!
Nope. We took her to lunch.
Oh, it was great. Mark is so sweet.
Shhh! I want to hear the rest!
NO, no science camp!
Oh God, I know I'm a pathetic loser.
Oh, God, ask them what they want.
Oh good God! I've fallen down!
I haven't seen him in so long!
I mean it's the end of an era!
I was laughing! You made me laugh!
I'll help you throw out your purse.
Honey, you got a little thing on your...
Hey, umm, can I ask you guys something?
I can not believe your trading me!!
Oh, we're leaving. Bye Kash.
Oh, oh, I love that Japanese place.
I'm just kidding! You can go pee!
Great! We will do all of those.
Hi! Emma will be up in a minute!
Get the hell out of there, y'know?
Wow you, you. I had no idea.
Okay, well, we brought you some wine.
So, like, you guys all have jobs?
Hey, Mon, I was just doing the dishes!
What, what's it, what's going on?
Oh, okay. Will you take my place?
Ohh, thank you, thank you, thank you.
I don't know why they didn't just tell us.
What? Shut up! We're winning!
And you really think this is a good idea?
Yes, we should. I think we should.
I don't know! I mean, what brought that on?
Hi Dr. Long, how are you?
No, absolutely. Y'know like it was umm...
You would do that? I never get picked!
Oh, I don't know. I guess we have to eat.
You know, actually it's more like, hi.
Since when do you watch the news?
Honey don't worry, it was my mistake.
Okay mommy, don't ever leave me.
Hey, what have you guys been up to?
So can we keep this between us?
Oh, well you know who I love the most?
Oh, I'm sorry I spoiled you're evening.
Okay that is the one we already have!
Do you guys know any cute guys?
Oh good. Ahhh! My God, sorry!
Well, I-I should've told you the truth.
Who are you saying "check" too?
I thought you only met him once?
It's not? When was she born?
Yeah, I mean, you should play in public!
Somebody got in late last night.
That's weird, she locked the door.
How many guesses do you get?
Yeah, but I'm pretty sure he's gay.
Oh, you are losing. Definitely losing.
That almost hit me in the face.
Good, Pheebs. What'd you buy?
'Cause I don't need your stupid ship.
Your fly is open, Geller.
Oh, screw you guys, you don't have to do it!
People are trying to sleep in here!
Here. I thought you might be cold.
Ok... "Emma just said gleba"!
Ok, uh-uh... Let's-Let's shop!!
Okay, get ready to see some beggin'!
See? Now, he could date her.
Honey I swear it we just kissed.
I cannot believe Ross is buying this!
Ssshyeah, well, duh! I mean...
But, but, Mona, I live here.
You can't, because of the new skylight!
Ross, why do you hate our child?
Wow! Spinning that sounds like fun.
I mean he just started going out with her.
Um, there was a Geller Cup?
So, Joey, what are you gonna do for us?
How about 600 and these earrings?
Ohh, you've waited soo long.
Oh God, that's right. I blocked that out.
They made you head of the department!
Oh, terrific! That'll be $2,000.
Whoa! Wait! Hello! What about me?
Well, what are you guys doing tomorrow night?
Okay, that we may be able to do.
Oh, slides. So really nothing happened.
I'm thinking, I'm gonna order a pizza.
Take the top down did ya?
Okay, let's do it. I'll move in.
I know that. That's why I was getting married.
Just give us our apartment back!
Ross, honey, is there anything we can do?
Ok. Thank you for coming with me today.
Okay. Just give us a second. Ross!
Well, y'know I-I don't know where he is.
Isn't that a line from the show?!
Yeah. Who's workin' for you babe?
It... You can so totally tell.
I'd need an expense account.
Uh, he took the SAT's for me.
Oh! I have your key. Here you go.
I just don't know! It just doesn't feel right.
Hi! Hey, Happy Valentine's Day!
This is how I would hold a football.
...if you tell me, I might do it.
Oh they're pushing! They're pushing!!
Uh, actually, I think I'm gonna be busy.
That is the sweetest thing, I just....
And I also brought my friend Joey...
Ohhhhh. That's how it got fixed!
Okay, you want me to stop at the ATM?
Ah, so what are we looking at?
Great! Now he's gonna know it was me!
Good, good, good, good, good.
Ooh! Oh wow this is so beautiful.
Okay. Are you sure you wanna hear this?
Hi, I'm back. Listen, I need to...
What? What's what you were afraid of?
So, uhm... what are you gonna do today?
Because she hates Pottery Barn.
Oh yeah! I mean, that was pretty intense.
What are you ever gonna use that for?!
Uh, look Ross, this really isn't easy.
Okay, maybe they are not funny to you...
Call her! Call her now!
"Yeah. That works for me."
Well, at least that's a great suit.
Hi mum, put her back on!
Hey, they were popular when I left!
Hey, hi! Hey, where've you been?
Get your hands out of there! No!
The ring from the cave, yeah.
Oh, now see that's a fancy but.
Wow! Would I have seen you in anything?
Are you seein her again tonight?
You were really gonna do that, weren't you?
Well...did you know he was gonna ask me?
Y'know, I'm still 29 in Guam.
Y'know Bob in Human Resources...
No, we didn't get married! That's ridiculous!
So, um, will you bring the truck?
Sure. I just sharpened her this morning.
Can I talk to you alone for a minute?
Well, Phoebe set me up on a date.
Well, there's two spots left right?
Oh! I've got a lot of those too!
We are so gonna find them this year.
Oh you did, there are twenty in here.
Why, how much is this gonna cost?
I wouldn't know what I'm gonna do without you...
I am. Let me just get my coat.
Yeah well what are you, his boyfriend?
We feel so terrible about this, Ross.
Great, shoot, what are we gonna do?
I'm sorry, Rosita? As in...
Phoebe, it's okay. I like living with Joey.
Who ? Joey: Me.
Oh you went to the movies by yourself?
Okay, you'd tell me the truth. Right?
What?! Chandler, what is the matter with you?!
Huh. Well, uh, that's uh, that's interesting.
Oh, right! Wait a minute, I do that too.
Well those are very popular frames.
So you guys go, have a really good time.
Joey, where did you learn that word?
Yeah, that'd be great. I'd love it.
Uh yes, heroin and crack.
I'm just sort of in the middle of something.
Yeah! All right, I'll see you guys later.
What if she jumped out the bassinet?
Op! Wait, you dropped a pea.
Oh, oh Ross, oh my God, are you okay?
Phoebe just found out about Monica and Chandler.
To get you to make out with him!!!
Oh, Monica, c'mon, you do cool things.
No, it's all right. I got nice boobs.
Hello? Who are we spying on?
Hi, and I am also Emma's mother.
Why on earth would I understand this?
That is neither here nor there.
All right, then you owe me $350.
Wow, so why don't you go talk to him?
Y'know who I always liked? Mork.
You don't want to work for a guy like that.
Honey, maybe we should take you to a doctor.
My boss wants to buy my baby!
I say 'cheesy line', but ok.
Ehhh, no, I wanna do Phoebe's thing.
Will you stop calling it your apartment!
Oh what, you-you want both of them?
Don't!! Honey, what are you doing here?!
Okay, calm down, here they are.
Me, Fledermaus, great. I really-
No, no, it's just that it's getting late...
Oh! That would be sooo much fun!
Monica, how come you never told me this?!
Aah! Why? What are these for?
You know, he was just doing his job...
All right... Oh, Emma loves him!
It happened! I am telling you it happened!
Kinda hurtin' my hand though.
Wow! If only more people knew.
Oh! Look! I have a sonogram picture!
Grammy, Best New Artist.
My gynecologist tried to kill me.
Well now it's an empty bar.
I know. It seems smaller somehow.
Uh, we are here to break up with you.
So, will I like any of these guys?
Did I miss it? Did I miss it?
But you did! I mean, let's be honest.
How could you not tell me you worked here?
Cat! What'm I saying? Cat!
You guys are really right...there aren't you?
: Sak's... Fifth... Avenue.
Do you even know who Kip is?
Joey, Joey I love you so much, but I...
Thank you, thank you, thank you, Pheebs.
What-what if I marry Ross-Or Joey?
Yeah! I'm going to Paris. Thank you, Ross!
I know I told you, it's a really big problem.
Seriously, your dad doesn't like pranks.
Ben, its Rachel! But whatever.
Hi! Oh, how was your date last night?
Ah, did I leave the stove on?
Yeah, you started it! I've got to chill.
Sure! God, please take those off!
Hey! Umm, do you guys have any juice?
The meeting with the guy went great?
Please, no, go, that'd be fine!
So did you read your evaluation yet?
Phoebe, I thought your dad was in prison.
Oh, God, oh, God, I mean it's just so.
Oh, god, I know it, that I freaked you out.
Hi Danny! Wow! Thirsty huh?
You took the same class twice.
Yeah and I'm a horrible, horrible person.
No don't! Go back to repeating!
Wo-women? You mean like old women?
Chandler gets it! It's Chandler Bing!
Come on, Joey, I did it and it was fine.
Hey Joey, how'd the audition go?
He's perfect, he's never been better.
You're all gonna be aunts and uncles.
No-no-no! No, no, no, we're not married.
N-no, Emma dropped her sock.
Thanks, you can just put it on the table.
You're gonna be late! Go! Go!
Okay, gotta go! Wish me luck!
Hey Phoebe, can I talk to you for a second?
No sorry hon, Monica's orders.
Yeah, we got him back. Everything's fine.
What?! My mom's not gonna be here?!
Do you even know what a vicar is?
Ross? Can we just close the door?
No! Seriously! What's wrong with you?!
Uh-huh... why... do you not like them?
You promised you would break up with her!
Even so, I think I'm gonna pick Ross.
Oh! So you're driving up to Connecticut?
Make love? What are you a girl?
God, you have to tell me what happens tomorrow!
Oh no, Baby Girl Geller-Green.
Oh, you are the lesser of two evils!
Chandler, relax, Chandler, she'll be here.
Oh God... Oh, he's in there right now?
Okay guys, way to wish me luck!
No way. No way did you do this.
Oh screw her, that part is mine!
Hang in there. You hang in there.
Oh, y-yeah, so, you-you love me!
Oh wait Chandler, too many cooks...
Manhattan does not have enough stores.
Yes! Thank you! Exactly! You want it?
Well what?! How-how much is it?!
Oh no, at the Grammies I always win.
Oo, toes!! Well, for some people.
Ross, please, don't be so scared of him!
Then, you will definitely get him back!
Ewww, ewww, ewww, ewww!
Y'know what? Let's, let's talk later.
Hey-hey! Oh, look at you, all sexy.
Well maybe I'll just stay here with Monica.
Well, yeah... Okay, look it's about me and...
Y'know, it is not like I did this on purpose.
Some uh, some visual aides.
Oh no! My new Paolo shoes!
What's your favourite thing about summertime?
Huh, well maybe it uh, it changed.
Huh-hoo, yeah, no, it's still basil.
Ross said my name. Okay? My name.
Hi! I just wanna--Ahhh!!! Oh my God! Oh my God!
Monica. You've, you've done it right?
Oh!! My God, what are you doing here?
Yeah, I think she wants the old one back.
No, you have it, really, I don't want it-
Can I please be there when you tell her?
Sorry I'm late, but I left late.
This one is uh Paul O'Neil.
Oh, this lipstick looks just great on you.
Now Joey, what did the duck do?!
Whatever Linus, I'm opening mine.
Well, what happened to your jam plan?
How is you drinking helping the kids?
Ohh, so no sign of Emily huh?
Joey. Honey what would I do without you?
No, not that, I mean, what about you and Mindy?
Oh, Pheebs, I don't even know where to start.
Why are- why are you so tanned?
Oh... ... Oh my God. He remembered.
W-What are you, what are you talking about?
No! Don't say that! Don't say that!
You went out with a guy in the Navy?
Oh, you know what? Rachel.. She just left.
Oh God twenty seconds my ass!!
No, I meant with the dropper over here.
I'm just visiting my good friend Carol.
Well and clearly not a minute sooner.
No, it wasn't. It was actually the...
Ok, I will have the uh, side salad.
I got-I get a big pay raise!
Oh God, even his knock is boring.
I guess I can talk to one of my supervisors...
Yeah, and I am okay with being a pushover.
I don't have any issues with my Father.
Okay, I'm just gonna write this out to cash.
Oh my God! You got her to stop crying!
Yeah, I can't *wait* to go back to work.
Um, what- what would make you think that?
Hey, Pheebs, quick question for ya.
Okay. Okay. Joey, it's okay. Settle down.
So Pheebs, what do you want for your birthday?
Oh, I went to have pizza. With Danny.
Oh! Well, um.. You've got plugs!
I was just going to say that I left my keys.
Oh, just tell us! We're not gonna want it!
I don't know. Maybe I'll know when I see him.
All right. What's your news, Amy?
Not for me. Chip and I broke up!
I'm not here! That's just my Chinese food!
I haven't seen you in like.. a year.
I-I-I-I'm just...I'm just a good kisser!
Well then why did you give me a ring?
Okay, Ross, I'm really trying to tell you something here.
Cute guys in little shorts? Sure.
Oh no, not in my room! I'll get him.
Ahhhhh, salmon skin roll.
Wiener, Wiener Wiener, Wiener!!!
No, I will. I'm just not up for it tonight.
You can't move. You just... you just can't.
Ish. I just don't think I can bear it.
You. Like you haven't done enough.
I can't. I'm busy. I'm apartment hunting.
Yeah, I'm doing okay. I'm um...let's talk.
Oh shoot! I work Monday nights.
Hey! That's just poking me in the eye!
Alright, Monica, I want you to have the first taste.
Well of course that is what I'm here for!
And now you're watching me walk away.
Why does it matter so much to you?!
What, because that's your answer to everything?
Oh, wow. Super ass-kissing power.
What are you doing?! Get in the front!
Oh, him, the little guy? Oh, I love him!
Oh my God, Phoebe, are you gonna go to jail?!
Can I see you in my office for a minute?
You need to learn some new slang.
Oh, oh, that's what you're talking about. Hey.
Open it! Open it! Open it!
Not gonna find any clothes in there!
Maybe that's all we do, what about Julie?
Oh my God, they let you keep that stuff?!
I'm doin' good, baby. How you doin'?
Joey, come on! We just went over this!
Wow! Well, clearly this is not a good time.
Yes! But what is wrong with this dog?!
I don't know. Do I have to decide right now?
What? Oh my God! I'm gonna miss you so much!
Why, when did you get out of the game?
Hey, don't listen to them. I think it's sexy.
Oh honey, I'm so proud of you, Min.
Well, I guess that's all in the past, now.
Babies don't care if they're slim.
Hey Mon? I'm gonna check my messages.
Ohhhhhh, look it's the roller blades.
Wow! Whoa-whoa what's under the covers?
But I-But everything is okay. I'm fine!
Aw what are you?! A detective?
Huh... wow, so he's gotta be...
Wow, I really get crabby when I cook.
No, everything's fine. I just gotta go back...
Me? Oh, no, I am not an actress.
Have you ever seen so much crap?
Well then he gets a divorce, it's Ross!
I know, I know, so it is just not a big deal.
What? You just click when they click.
At his apartment. Is this juice?
When Carol was pregnant with Ben...
No-no-no! This chair's not going anywhere.
Yeah. Umm, unless you wanna come inside?
Ooh, I just feel bad, I never vacuum.
Alright. So where'd you grow up?
Ohh, wait a minute, we haven't pre...
What...that scene I saw was so good!
I don't know, what were the names I just said?
Wow! Mon, thanks! I love this plate!
And you're no friend to those with noses.
Well, Phoebe that's fine because I'm not moving.
I don't know. Y'know, they didn't get us anything.
Um-hmm. There we go. There it is.
Okay Ross, can I uh, can I ask you something?
What, what, what, no, I don't wanna do that.
Did he call? Did Mark call?
You wanna go inside and have some coffee?
Well, what's the other thing, what do I think?
And um, excuse me, he helps me.
Okay, you gotta give me some of your piece.
And a nice hot cider for Monica.
I'm so dead serious. I'm totally serious.
Ohh! It's so nice to meet you. Hello.
Come on see, she doesn't look that bad.
Oh, it's just like a bloodbath in here today.
Pheebs, could you maybe hand me a cracker?
Remember that big thing I was gonna tell you about?
Oh! Tommy, this is Ross. Ross, Tommy.
'Kay. Congratulations on your new job.
Hey, how's...how's the uh, miracle chair?
I-I, got a job at Ralph Lauren.
Please? YES! Sandy you're hired.
So, whaddya think George is like?
Hey. Gosh, you look soo familiar.
Guess who we ran into today?!
Pheebs, I don't think anyone's mad about that.
Oh yeah, they're really great! Aren't they?
Yes, the hard part is truly over.
Oh, it's just... Oh, Barry, this was not good.
But honey, I think she's moving in with Chandler.
Okay. Umm, what should we do for the theme?
Oh... that's too bad. Bye bye.
Already? That's pretty bad what you did.
So umm, what time are you supposed to leave?
That's right! You do what the hand says!
Oh! I remember laughing! I laughed a lot.
Hey, wait a minute! That is my sock!
Oh but look! That's gonna leave a stain!
You don't pick me! You're stuck with me!
Oh, she's coming up! She's coming up!
Oh my god, I left the water running.
That yeti is one smooth talker.
I don't think he's the one who needs help.
Alright, c'mon! Let's play Twister!
There isn't. There is totally isn't.
What do you mean you quit?! You can't quit!
Yeah, come on! What's going in on in there?
If we broke up, and I lost you...
Excuse me! You didn't tell him, did you?
Maybe, but shouldn't we wait for Chandler?
Wait a minute! What are you gonna tell Joanna?
Okay. Hang up! That's it! Come on!
Ugh, how can you even ask that question?!
Plus, you know, he is with Charlie now.
Honey, what are you doing? That's too heavy.
Okay, let me just get a cup of coffee.
I tried! They won't take her back.
Why, does she have a bad personality?
Oh! There's nothing above your bed!!
What?! Why? Joey you were so ready for it!
When did you go to a sperm bank?
Oh, wait Ross! I'm sorry, one more thing!
I a not gonna lie to you, I'm pretty sick.
Okay, y'know what? We don't need her measurements.
Why? You saw it? Is it scary?
Oh, if she jumps, I get her tickets.
Uh-huh. Y'know what I was, I was thinking about?
I'm gonna go get one of those job things.
Well! Good night. I'm going upstairs.
I got to figure out what I'm going to wear.
Aren't you a little cute to be a doctor?
Oh I don't know honey. It's gonna be really late.
Monica, you broke up with him for a reason.
OK, OK. I'm with you, Cheech. OK.
Hey, do you guys have any extra ribbon?
And you just get to be cool Aunt Phoebe!
I think you should definitely go out with this guy.
Come feel this! Come feel my belly!
Chandler Bing? It's time to see your thing.
Monica, I don't want to lose 200 dollars.
Yep! Happy and healthy! And cute!
Uh, Pheebs? Who's George Snuffalopagus?
You gave her a key to your apartment?!
Yeah, I did. I needed my lucky dress.
Let me, let me get you some wine!
Ross, I didn't think it would that big of a deal.
Joey I don't think you know what behalf means.
What? Wait! Why...why do you get the story?
I'm-I'm-I had no idea. I'm sorry. I...
Hey! Y'know what? Let's talk about relationships!
Rome. Jerk missed his flight.
Well just ask Mona to give it back!
Hi. Look um, about what happened earlier...
Is this a little too... Pheebs, what happened?
Oh, I don't think she likes the new Hugsy.
Agh, it was the graduation from hell.
Well, maybe that's, maybe that's really brave.
Ohh, you guys are so made for each other.
Oh, Phoebe, that really cute guy is here again.
I... Well, I don't think they need any help.
Um, seven...e-e-eight, eight years. Wow.
Three people. Joshua's not gonna be there.
Oh! Emma, that's right! You're that many!
Oh my God, look there's Roy Gublik.
If I said I was, would you judge me?
So are things with you and Joey any better?
Yeah, I know. It's ridiculous! I can't see you either.
Oh, really, let me see, let me see.
Oh now daddy, stay calm. Please.
I know! My God! Do you have your speech?
Umm, I think he's still out. What's wrong?
I thought I was making him filet mignon?
Whoa, look at you, you did pretty well.
Oh my God! You really are freakishly strong!
Oh wow, you are really, you're really a creep.
Luisa? Oh my God! Monica! It's Luisa!
Look at that guy by the window, wow!
Well, well, well, look what mommy found!!
Monica! Look! Hi! What do ya think?
Oh my God! Did you get to see anything good?
Oh, it's so late for 'Shall we'...
You were with Kenny today, weren't you?
All right, wherever you wanna go is cool.
Ooo! Oh, I forgot they made sheets!
What, it's ok when Chandler does it?
Chandler!! Promise me, you will end it.
Well, why doesn't he practice with a girl?
Oh yeah? Did he pull the old...
Nobody, forget it! Rachel: Maybe.
Wow! You certainly think a lot of yourself.
Yeah, why is it so hard for you to believe?!
Oh-oh, sorry, it's this way, it's this way.
I know, me neither! I mean, you had a sketch!
No! It's just that, Kate bothered me.
Hi! Is my misery amusing to you?
Okay. Okay. Okay. Joey, I have got to tell you something!
Well, then I lost it. You buy me one!
Well, because she loves you and because you love her.
Tell her to wear her own earrings.
Hi! Are you ready? We're gonna be late!
Ok, we never shoulda talked about this.
And so were-were you close to your parents?
Damn! I wish I knew if that was right!
Oh, I found him. He was Paolo's cat.
Ross, we actually watched the documentary together.
Alright, alright, so I'm not a great typist...
Oh, I can't. Because I-I've seen them.
Ok, let's not make a big thing about this!
Okay, you're right. You're right. You can't help me.
Ohh! You did not drop any socks!
See your twenty-five...and...uh, Monica, get my purse.
Oh you really, you really just don't want to hear about it.
Phoebe, you had a date three days ago.
Oh, come on, would you just grab my ass.
You have been maid of honor before?!!
Well, isnt, isnt that gonna be weird?
Stop it! Marcel! Bad monkey!
How many ways are there to do that?
Ross, you don't even have oven mitts on!
I was gonna give you a chance to apologise to me.
Hey, Mr Philips, nice suit!
Yeah, well, you uh, better make it for three.
I'm not asking you to go on a date with him!
Love you too... Alright, I'm going to bed.
My due date is in one week!
You guys are gonna come and visit me, right?
Gotta go! Hi! Wow! There you go!
Yeah well, you know what, so is uh, Sorentino's.
Well you could've untied it with your hands.
EHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!! My God!!!!!!!!!!! Oh my God!!!!!!!
No, it's not better. I still don't get to see you.
Do you want to put the book in the freezer?
And that's I'm so glad... there's no problem.
I mean, y'know I'm just gonna have to accept it ...
Open your drapes! Open your drapes!
Well, this is really awkward Oh, and I can leave!
I'm not moving! Is that picture straight?
It was really fun being married to you tonight.
Don't look at me I never get his jokes.
What?!! Stop it! Stop it! Oh my God!
Yeah! But I don't know what he looks like!
Wiper blades. I don't even have a car.
But I haven't used my card in weeks!
C'mon, he's right. Tit for tat.
Pheebes, this woman is voluntarily bald.
I wonder how Monica and Chandler could do it?
Oh God. It seems like forever ago.
Really? Who would, who would you marry?
Am I going to let you watch me undress?
Oh Pheebs, is that a new ankle bracelet?
Nooo, he's leaving for a better job.
Phoebe!! Phoebe!! It's okay!! It's okay!!
The thing is y'know, that you're married to Emily.
You can keep those pants by the way.
Phoebe, don't you think you've had enough to drink?
Ok, you know what, I'm just gonna take her outside.
Phoebe is gonna be Monica's maid of honor!
Oh, y'know what, I didn't want cinnamon on this.
Oh! Oh my God! I thought she was on Atkins.
Wha... are you kidding? I can't return this.
Thank you. What? You don't want to see this do you?
Oh my God! We have to throw her a shower?!
I think she's checking out your beehive Ross.
Wha.. well, Ella's a nice name!
Oh, I know... I know it's been really hard for you.
Wrong! How do you get the mainsail up?
Wait a minute! Why don't you guys do something?!

A cyborg?! Isn't that like a robot?!
God how long do you think that's gonna last?
Joey...there's something that you...should know. Dina?
Yeah, Why? You don't think a woman can do this?
Monica, betting the apartment, I don't know about this.

And I'm in it? Then let me read it.
What? Who the hell is Emily- noooo!!
Yeah, but how much can you tell from a look?
All right, well how much time do you need?
Oh, Monica. You are not still going over that thing.
Well, so, why don't you just turn it off?
Look at you, you are so big I can't believe it!
Hey! Great advice on that Joey thing!
Oh you know what, you sound just like his wife!
Well, then I get to give him the cell phone.
I can't believe it! He still hasn't called.

Oh, he is precious! Where did you get him?
Okay, y'know what? Can I, can I talk now?
I can't watch. It's like firing Elmo.
Okay Phoebe, we can not tell anyone about this.
Do you really want an award you didn't win?
Come on Phoebe! Don't be such a goodie-goodie!
Phoebe, Shania Twain is still alive!
Ross, I don't, I just don't think it's going to fit.
You think you're gonna get out of this on a technicality?
Phoebe, isn't Jethro Tull a band?
Well, I sorta did a stupid thing last night.
I don't like sitting up here! I'm just gonna over...
Well, what'm I gonna do? What'm I gonna do?
There were times when it wasn't even me.
Joey, it's just a chair! What's the big deal?
Ohh, okay, how about five. Ohh, thank you.

Well then you're going to have to take her out again.
Yeah. What kind of discount do we get?
Hey, listen umm, what-what are you doing tonight?
What about you honey, who would be on your list?
You put holes in my baby's ears!

Yeah! Once, I figure out what I'm wearing.
Do you got your gracious loser face?
Well, yeah! We're cool. Totally cool.
Oh, come on! We know what these are worth.
Ooh, I have to go pack. It really does?
Oh for God sake just pick a piece!
Really?! How come we didn't cross paths?
Burning's good. Yeah, I got stuff to burn.
Oh my God, Monica's gonna go out with a millionaire.
All right. Okay Chandler, enjoy your handful.
We got locked out of the apartment, we ...
Oh, I'm sorry, I guess I just bring it out in him.
It's not a purse! It's a shoulder bag.
You are friends with Dr. Drake Remoray?
Well, we're not seeing each other, so....
You guys aren't doing anything tonight, are you?
Oh sure I am, because you always have to be right.
Oh, that's okay, girls tend not to like me.
Yes. Paolo sent them from Italy.
Yeah! His name is um, Mark something.
So-Hey, Pheebs! So, how are the elves?
Well, as long as we are clear about that.
Well, I guess we just find a divorce lawyer?
No, no, no... No, I mean... se-x-u-ally...
Okay. Walked right into that one didn't he?
Chandler, you stole this cheesecake. That is wrong.
Oh, hey, don't you have to go pick up Emily?
You could.... say you're sorry to her mom.
And I'm Rachel, an admirer of the building.
All right that's it! I am maid of honor!
Yeah, you like that baby? May we help you?
Phoebe, I bet somebody's missing that badge.
Can't I just look at the handles on them?
Now just how big of a star is Marcel?
I cannot believe I'm gonna meet Jessica Ashley!
Oh no, I can't tell you until you tell me what you know.
So you were in an I Hate Rachel club?
They're in Vermont!! How could this happen?!
No, it's been three nights in a row.
No, no, no, you said, "got the keys".
And you were at this job for four years?
You are the official baby crier stopper!
And you're still not attracted to him at all?
Well, I should think so. You slept with someone.
Yes you are! Oh, I am so proud of you!
No, no no no, don't need to know the details.
Y-Yeah! What-what is your wife's name?
Okay. Well, I gotta go you guys. I'll see you later.
Joey, what... is... this...thing... doing here?

Oh, I'm sorry, you're right.I'm sorry, good luck!
Well, because of us! Because of our history.
Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here..
Well you're not gonna be able to keep doing this.
Well, we have gotta find out if he's alive.
I'm the hell person whose office this is!
Well maybe, maybe she's with us right now?
How could you not tell me that she has hair?
Wow, I am so glad I'm not Monica right now.
Okay, Pheebs, I was hoping for more of a change.
You're right, I don't have to apologize. Sorry. Damnit!
Chandler!! You have the best taste in men!
I'm sorry. I didn't-I don't come in here a lot.
Oh good, great! I'll-I'll keep that in mind.
You are never going to believe what happened to me today.
Ross said there's still no word from Chandler.
Okay, that was Phoebe Buffay, everybody. Woo!
Okay, now make it even, 'cause we don't...
Oh please, what do you know! You married a lesbian!
I don't know. I know I don't work late tomorrow night.
What if I clean your bathroom for a month?
Oh, I'm sorry, did my back hurt your knife?
Hey, umm, do you guys have that tape measure?
Oh no-no-no! No, I got this all under control.
So Pheebs, what are you going to do with your $3?
Yeah, but you said, "Will you marry me?"
Whoops. Oh, hey, do you need help with that?
This Alan again? How's it goin'?
See, I don't know, for me it would have to Chantal.
Yeah. Ahh, here's a box of your stuff.
Argh! Why does everything happen to me?!
Hey Phoebs. Oh hey, how's the dog?
Yeah, yeah I think I'm gonna find my own place.
Oh yeah. In fact you know what I'd do?
Ed Begley Jr. is not gay.
How come we have one extra place setting?
Everything you need to know is in that first kiss.
Oh, I love to ski! How amazing is this?!
Has anybody seen my engagement ring?
Yes of course, absolutely! You're right. I'm sorry.
Okay. You too. And I hope you score. Bye.
Yes! And please tell her to bring a cake!

Huh, yeah I guess we are roommates now.
Oh my God, Le Poo, our dog!
Wow! I mean I had no idea that that was gonna...
Yes I do, it's just that Ross is. . .
You have no respect for anybody's privacy!
Okaaay. Any of you guys want anything else?
Mom that's okay that you didn't get you a gift!
Monica, can Phoebe borrow your green dress?
No no no, wait, I wanna see what happens.
Oh but Phoebe, we're gonna be late for the movie.
Really? Wow, this is so much better than I...
Okay, okay, okay, fine, I'm gonna look it up .
Well, are we all together? Like in a group?
I hope it's still funny when you're in hell.
Well, Chandler said that it's really important to him too!
Oh thank you! Oh God! Can I have another one?
Yeah sure, iced tea would be great.
HEY!! Do you have to do that? It's Saturday!
Joey, honey, I don't think you're supposed to go back there.
Hey! What happened to you? Why didn't you come up?
Relax! It's not like it's Citizen Kane!
Oh wait, I have the ten of spades! Here!
Oh Joey honey I don't...I don't want to lose...
See? I've even called Animal Control!
From you. I exchanged the blouse you got me.
Oh, honey! Don't get up! What do you need?
Yeah, I didn't want you to get hit by the boom!
Fine, I will. Alright, fill me in!
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's just...It's just so sad!

Oh Ross, honey you gotta stop torturing yourself!
Your agent called. You got that audition.
Well, can I keep the presents and still be 29?
What? You guys, come on! What am I going to do?

Are you serious-Really?! It's in such good condition.
Would you stop?! What is the matter with you?!

I wasn't supposed to put beef in the trifle!
Okay, but Ross, eventually you and I are gonna be dating.
All right, we've got to tell her he's gone.
That's right. You're very cheeky for a temp.
Y'know, you should never be allowed to talk to people!
Oh! Ok. Ok, you really wanna know who it is?
People keep saying that. Oh I'm sorry Gavin.
Joey, what-what are you doing going into my bedroom?!
Ross, get over it! It's not like she hates you.
Okay, okay, could we change the subject, please?
You really, really need to get some sleep, honey.
We ended up having sex in his chair.
The job is in Paris. FADE OUT.
What's-what's going on? Phil's really pissed!
Oh my God! Oh, that's funny, I can't believe I did that.
Come on. Oh! And, uh, by the way....
The most unbelievable thing happened to me today.
Well, what is a boss for? Hug it out!
You guys are unbelievable. No! He cannot come.
Shh-shh-shh! The guys don't know yet do they?
Oh, Ross, I'm sorry. I completely ruined your evening.
Ooh, do I sense a little bit of resentment?
Oh, Sophie, I guess you didn't hear about Joanna...
Can you believe what a jerk Ross was being?
Oh no. No-no! I think my water just broke.
These are from Halloween three years ago.
Oh, well, that's - that's very sweet. Thank you.
Oh nothing I... Sorry, I just can't stop crying.
I don't wanna hear "Three failed marriages!"
Well would you like me to lie down on the table?
What-what?! You're gonna leave this person with me?!
Can you please, please take care of it for me?
Well... well, what did you do to make her laugh?
Hey, it's not that big a deal, I was just curious.
Hello?! I still don't know what the hell I'm doing!
Aside from the fact that you said you had them?
Ohh, I love Joey! Joey lives with a duck!
I can't believe this! This is Emma's first Thanksgiving!
I just purchased the La-Z-Boy E-cliner 3000.
Okay-okay that-that's amazing. How did you know that?
Hey Pheebs, you're still alive! How are you doing?
Oh, thank you so much for coming. Ross, get in here!
It's a standard issue bra clasp!
Yeah! I am soo gonna marry that guy. Ohhh!
Yeah. Uh-huh, I guess it is pretty big news.
Ummm, I think it's time to see the ring again.
Oh my God! How long has she been crying?
Okay come on Phoebe, it's nothing! Monica, come on!
Excuse me? Oh yeah? Well, up yours too!
Actually, y'know that's not the Thanksgiving I was talking about.
Anybody! You, me, you know, Monica's mom...
Ross couldn't fit down the trash chute.
Ok. Wha...? where? Where are you going?
Oh, I blew it. I wouldn't of even hired me.
Ross, would you just stop it! It's getting really old.
Joey, why wouldn't you invite us to your parties?
So, which of this kitchen stuff is mine?
Yes, but still. They're people...with eyes.
Where's Chip, why isn't he here yet?
Heeeeey, where have you been? What happened to you?
I made the mistake of telling him that I was pregnant.
Oh, yeah, well hey, welcome to our sauna.
Well that works out good, because I'm not listening.
Oh, so you just sort of happened to leave it in here?
No-no-don't! Don't leave me here with these people.
Now, what exactly is in a cobb salad?
Oh I see, so this suit is making a point.
Oh! Whoops! I'm sorry, you were talking about Emily!
But your divorce isn't even final yet.
Not Joey, no, I was just lusting after Chandler.
No! Sorry, I just thought you were somebody else. Hi!
Only 'cause you took up half the circle.
Woah, woah, woah, what book is this?
Well, he gets the other one all riled up.
Well, that-that's not your choice. Happy Halloween!
Well, I'm also sending out.... good thoughts.
Yeah that seems fair. We never use them.
Yeah, well it was. I, I broke a cup.
Okay, but before you go, could you help me first?
All right, you guys, I kinda gotta clean up now.
Well, I'm sorry I'm not going to an eye doctor!
Why? Do you have the answers written on there?
Wh-Hey, I just gave you peeing on a stick.
"Baddest man in the whole damn town."
Hey, so did everything go all right with the annulment?
I know isn't it? It's like I'm right there with Joshua.
So my mother is not coming to my baby shower?!
Here he is. Hi. Guys, this is Russ.
You're right, you're right. I should just tell her the truth.
Wait, what do you mean you're getting a new brain?
Oh my God, they told us that was for the mascot!
But I already told Zelner that I would come back...
Yeah! I'm gonna have a boyfriend, you're gonna have a girlfriend...
Come on! You guys can pee standing up.
Even when we were having sex in that chair?
Yes! That I know, this is from White Plains.
Oh my God! You are giving this a lot of thought.
What?! What?! My birthday's not for another month!
No, I think it's very obvious who's wrong here.
Remember when we were in high school together?
Ohh, my new assistant is working out, yes.
Whoa! Hey-hey, you planning on inviting us?
Yeah, not girls anyway, guys agree like that.
Wait-wait where are you going? Where are you going?
Okay, I thought it was about your neighbors liking you.
Why? Why not?! People love to hear that!
Oh, yeah, check it. Definitely, I want some of that.
Yeah, I told you to give Emily whatever she wants.
Yeah, and Lennart Haze is starring in it.
No. What do you do if I say we are coming about?
Joey! Kinda in the middle of a story here!
Hi. Can Emma and I live here for a while?
But can it... just... happen a little bit?
Okay. Oh wait, wait-wait, you're not gonna come with me?
Yeah, right. Look at you, you're practically giddy.
This is Bonnie? This is Bonnie? You're Bonnie?
No, she was just much better at job than me!
Ross, what's the big deal? So I kissed the guy!
I don't know. Whatever I was feeling, I'm... not.
Do you still have that, um, Navy uniform?
Now the filet mignon, what comes with that?
Oh Ross, would you stop, you got me, I'm dating you.
Oh, 'scuse me. I was kinda using that machine.
Uh no, he's not. Can I take a message?
Because, I can't! Ross, I told you, no. I can't.
Oh, no, meh-nah-nah-nah, come on you're gonna ruin it!
Yeah, no, I don't-I don't put things in my eye.
No. And then I called him, and he wasn't there.
Dealer takes two. What do you bet?
Well, okay. Would-would you get me a Diet Coke?
Oh, please tell me it's not because I'm going with Mark.
Oh my God! That's so great! I'm so happy for you guys!
All gone! So, farm birds, huh?
Alright you guys, I'm takin' off my shirt.
Whoa! I can't believe you did that. That was really sweet.
What? What is so strange about me having a date?
That's it? Well I saw that! Ohh-ohh-oh, thank you.
I've got magic beans. Never-never mind.
All right, that's it, you guys! What happened out there?
What? Oh my God! I'm so sorry. Joey? Are you ok?
No. But don't worry, I'm sure they're still there.
Ohh, Lilies. Joey, they're my favorite. Thank you.
All right, so are we not having dinner at all?
Nice seizing. . . gel boy.
Ohh! Right! Right, sorry, I'll be right back!
I've never given her a cookie. Have you?
whoo... ok... wow... ok... OH!
I swear, I never wanted any part of your night!
I cannot, I cannot believe that I invited you here today.
Yeah, what, so? You had feelings for me first.
Well, maybe they can find a way to bring you back.
Oh, y'know, would you just for once, not remember every...little...thing!!
Because I think I just heard her moving around in there.
Maybe she hasn't really thought it through that well.
And I will make everyone call me Mrs. Geller!
Hi, I thought you might like some ice chips.
Thank you. Well, I guess we have some time to kill.
You're not the man who left the cell phone.
Oh, honey, don't worry. She's gonna make it on time.
Hi! I just want to apologize. I'm really sorry I was a baby.
I'm just kidding too. I'm getting married in December.
Did you not get a good enough look the other day?
Op, op, car! Car!! Ugh!!!
All right! Who's are they? Who's are they?
Wow! Wow. Wow. Wow, it is hot in here.
Wow! This is so amazing! What else? What else?
Oh well, y'know, the gala had to end sometime.
Timmy was my boyfriend and you made out with him!
Okay, it's missing something. Ooh, I know! Umm, okay.
Hey Ross! Any word on the apartment yet?
Dark, big hair, with the airplane earrings.
Well, that would've been very hard to say no too.
Okidoki! Wow! We're never gonna find a nanny.
Oh well yeah me too. Um.. I had a baby.
I don't know, I just kinda ran into him last night.
Yeah. No. And you know what? Nobody even saw!
Right, yeah, I've heard that about cute doctors.
Yeah, actually Daddy Ross is allergic to lobster.
Hi. Sorry, things aren't working out so well.
Oh, wow thanks! Oh you're in real estate!
That refrigerators don't live as long as people.
What? Wait-wait a minute, what? Phoebe, what's the matter?
Nice! One and a half carat easy.
Oh Phoebe, we forgot that party we have to go to.
Yeah... I, uhh... I have a... I have a date.
Well, you're not sixteen, you're both adults now.
O-o-o-okay, how did it go? Tell me everything.
Oh Pheebs that's so sweet--Ooh, those are so cute!
You gotta see these latest pictures of Emma.
Uh Pheebs, we just actually kinda wanted to be alone.
Wow. I, I don't even know what to say. Thank you.
Ummm. Oh! I'm sorry. It's a little old but...
Whoa, I'm sorry. Excuse me. We had this cart.
So, does this come in another color or...
Well, I'll ask him for you, if you want me too?
I can't talk to you. I can't even look at you right now!
Uh, well, I think, I think he broke up with me.
Okay. Seriously, breathe louder Ross! That's great!
So just bring it back downstairs, what's the problem?
Yeah! And until now, I didn't think I'd love again.
Well, I was gonna, but I accidentally read something else.
Chandler? It's Alan, he wants to speak to you.
Monica...would you please tell Joey that he is a pig?
Oh, Monica! Would you stop being such a wuss?
All right! Well, uh... we're gonna hit the beach?
You know what, Ross? I think we're gonna take off too.
Hey! You remembered to put clothes on this morning.
Oh, but look how straight those noodles are!
Want a wedding dress? Hardly used.
I-I-I of course, I have more responsibilities than that.
He's so cute! And he seems to like you so much.
Yeah but, I've never asked a guy out before.
Hey Pheebs, can I talk to you over here for a second?
Wait, I'm not just gonna drink somebody's old coffee.
Okay, a couple months late on the lecture, Ross.
Yes, of course there is! Okay? I'm not insane!
Umm, well let's see Monica and Chandler are occupied.
Oh well, too late, sorry, you already had some.
Well, screw charity work. What've you got?
Hi, I'm Rachel Green. What can I do for you Joshua?
Yeah, Joey kinda disabled it when I moved in.
Oh honey, thank you, but Mark's taking me out.
No! There is.. there is noone else!
Ross! Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me....
So umm, how-how are we gonna mess with them?
That was amazing. I can't even send back soup.
And uh, he will have a white wine spritzer.
Well, however great she was I just can't afford that.
Oh, could somebody give me a hand with this zipper?
What-yeah-what, y'know what? I hope Emily is a lesbian.
Seriously Pheebs, it's not gonna be that kind of a party.
Ohh, well I'm not totally back yet, but thank you.
What? What? Ross, you're scaring me. What's going on?
I'm sorry Pheebs, I guess I'm just really said that I'm leaving.
I am so psyched I kept this chair for myself!
Oh, come on Ross! I think it would be really good for you!
Oh, it's the best! So, umm how's Monica?
I know! I know, it's such a huge, life-altering thing.
Ahh, yes, I will have a glass of the Merlot
Ya know, Dr. Burke kissed me once.
Or ya know, he's rubber and you're glue.
Really nice to meet you... and we'll call you.
But Erin Brockovich had her own house.
Oh my God... What.. What are you guys doing here?
That was her idea, I just gave her a nudge.
Oh, well, you're not catching me on my best day.
OK... see your two... and I raise you twenty.
Here it is! I love it. I wear it all the time.
Yes! On a cake shaped like a bunny.
Oh my God! You're a 30 year old virgin!
Ooh, you guys, it starts in like 20 minutes.
Yeah, well, feminism yes, but also the robots.
Oh, honey, I'm sure there's nothing wrong with the plane.
Have you ever had any weird romantic dreams?
Oh, Barry..! Come on, this is all way too..
This is so awesome! College guys are so cute!
Is Monica around? I-I have to ask her something.
Oh-oh!! One hand on the sheet Joe!
..You're, you're 'mah mah mah' what?
Yes, I did. Thank you very much, it was excellent.
Tag is not the father! And Joey knows now?
Yeah, love. It's a tricky business isn't it?
Or I'll give them to my new boyfriend, Joshua.
Ross? All this time? Well, I've got to talk to him.
I-I-I didn't! I didn't! She thought you were cute.
Cecilia Monroe man, what a great actress.
Well, get 'em out of here! What's wrong with you?
No, that day... that won't be her real birthday!
Y'know what, I want you to leave! Get outta here!
Oh, thanks. So, uh, what are you gonna do this summer?
Ugh, I knew it! Oh I cannot believe those two!
Hey Chandler. Monica just broke my seashell lamp.
So uh, Ryan, were you shipping off to?
And... that's the most sex I'm gonna have this weekend.
Isn't it incredible?! Monica and Chandler, gettin' married.
A card! A card! I pick a card!
Ok, Ross, Ross, ok listen, what we have is amazing.
So what do you say? Can I be your girlfriend again?
So Chandler, have you heard about Monica's secret boyfriend?
Well, y'know this whole marriage thing, kinda my idea.
Ross, you stay here and talk, I'm gonna go have a baby.
Now wait a minute. You just took all the words!
Well, that doesn't sound like a very merry Christmas.
Hi! So I just dropped Emma off at my mom's.
Ooh, Julie's so smart, Julie's so special.
Yeah, he did! Oh, see, this is what I'm talking about!
What? What secrets? You know secrets? What are they?
Uh great! How do you feel about Diet Coke?
I still don't get how you know when it's false labour.
Well what if I told you, you can do it in my apartment?
Yeah, and and, I'm just gonna pay for this with a check.
Look, I'm fine. Watch. Look at that. Whoa-whoa!
Joey, get Amy's bags, she is moving out!
Oh!! I love this job! Wow! My first call.
Now, that-that was a good thing that I told you, right?
No, that's ok, let's me just get my check book!
Y'know Joey, I could teach you to sail if you want.
All right, I'll-I'll take it again when I get home.
You do know that I will be here when he comes over.
I can't believe they've been together for three years.
Stop it! Cut it out! Cut it out!
There is a hardware store right down the street?
Well, so, are-are you sure that there are three?!
No! Really, no, please, please, that's, that's okay.
Oh, wait! Sorry, Mr. Paul? Mr. Paul?
All right, who's turn is it to help me get up!
Ok, I, I will do your laundry for one month.
So now, what exactly is the point of the box?
Oh, well maybe there was a dog lookin' at him.
Oh that couldn't have been pretty. but you know guys do that.
You're right, I'm sorry. Thank you. Okay, that's what I'm gonna do.
Okay Ross come on let's just forget about the condoms.
Well-well a little blind sided but y'know good.
Oh yeah! I've come up with a bunch of ideas!
So, he's on the show, he knows what happens.
Ross, didn't you say that there was an elevator in here?
Hi. Listen, I was um, thinkin' about. . .
Yeah, pretty nice, huh? Now who's a pushover?
Oh, how does he look? How does he look?
Huh, that's funny. You look like you're gonna be the...
I don't know, it was you and a bunch of albino kids.
Oh my God! Oh Monica! Those boots are amazing!
Any chance you think the couch looks good there?
I'm talking about a bet, winner takes all.
yeah I didn't disguise that very well did i.
Yeah. Just to be sure I'm gonna call Dr. Wiener.
Oh my God! Why is he jumping on those women!
Well, y'know I was thinking of moving the couch over here.
Oooooooooh. Oh, that's nice. Oh, oh. Huh, Ross!
Shut up that was my friend Melissa from college.
Joanna, this is my friend Chandler Bing Joanna.
I do need you! I need you to stand near my head!
Hey, thanks Ross, for taking care of all of this.
Heyyyyy! Contraceptives are not always effective! Right?
Yeah, I know... ..I'm I'm just not that bright either.
Okay. Well be careful with her, she's really tiny.
Hi you. I can't believe I'm waking up next to you.
You remember not having sex in high school, right?
Oh Ross, hi! Hey, how are ya? There you are!
Yes, I've done my studying and I really know my stuff.
But y'know umm, Rachel doesn't rhyme with draddle.
Okay well Ross! Stop it please! Wait a minute!
Alright, Emma is napping... what happened to your shirt?
Oh yeah, now everybody wants to be under this hat!
Did Joey say what he was gonna go when he left?
Oh that's so great, now Emma has two Hugsy's.
You like that? Let's take this into high gear.
Then what's that big lump under your covers?
No!! You are getting married! This is all I have.
Well, I have a job interview at Ralph Lauren tomorrow!
Yeah okay, you laugh now, but she's gonna be yours.
Ugh, Monica I don't want to steal your stupid thunder!
Oh, but y'know, no, you didn't give me your phone number.
Hey, how are those tapes working out for ya?
Yeah, y'know I-I think I'm just gonna hang out in my room.
Do you even understand what off the rack means?!
Oh boy, I just can't watch. It's too scary!
Well, I've brought some books. We could read.
What's the big deal? Why don't you wanna see Janice?
Hey Mon, look what I just found on the floor. What?
Okay, you are going to tell her and you're going to tell her now.
Oh, you know what? Let's not say anything else. I love you.
Shhh...I don't know what to do, this is totally unprecedented.
Yes! Yes! Yes, you do want to know! This is unbelievable!
We are looking for our Christmas presents from Monica.
Well Monica seems to think it's because you have feelings for me.
Of course it's true and it hurts so bad.
Oh no, no, no. Oh God, you think I made out with him.
Hey guys do you think this is too slutty-Hi Kash!
Don't say, "Oh my God!" Oh my God what?
That is it! You just barge in here, you don't knock
All right, who would uh, like some yams? Will?
Hello. Umm, when is your next flight to London?
Yeah! You-you got the job! You're my new assistant!
Well, why don't you talk to me about it, maybe I can help.
Well better than you, but y'know still not what you want.
Yeah, I just get a little bummed when my birthday's over.
Okay, well, I'm gonna clear out some of these boxes.
Oh! Phoebe, why did you lie to me about working here?
Well, I guess I could take a couple days off work.
I'm doing just fine! God, Tiffany, you smell so great!
Guess what. Ben just said his first word.
Sure, but come on, as big as your wedding?
Why would a charity give away a free boat?!
Oh, I beg to differ. The Pictionary incident?
I know. Ross still sees his pediatrician!!! I don't care!
Oh yeah, we were but umm, now we've got candy.
But I saved it. I put my basket on top.
Oh, well, it pretty much sucked. How was yours?
Hey! Those are all the things I'm responsible for!
Yeah, uh you-you probably need that for stamps, right?
Yeah that's right! Come on Joey; sex me up!
Hey-whoa, slow down. No, keep moving. Wow!
Yes, you did! And don't you say, "No, I didn't!"
Oh wow, you didn't even try to unhook my bra!
Okay. Phoebe, I-I think Ross is right. What are we gonna do?
Well how can that be, you were just kissing Sabrina?
Okay. So, can I serve you a little of-What? What? What?
Oh thank you so much Mr. Kaplan, thank you so much.
Monica, what is with you? Who'd you have lunch with?
Seriously stop it, or I'm gonna jump on ya.
Phoebe, how would you do this to me? This was all your idea.
So hot I cried myself to sleep last night.
And fifty. So it was like one and fifty dollars.
Ohh, God, I just got so nervous that he would say no.
Ohh, I'm gonna miss that big old squishy butt.
Joey, what are you talking about? You're a terrific actor.
Hey uhm, do you remember that one really great time...?
Ooh, I was kinda hoping that wouldn't be an issue...
It's just so frustrating! Why doesn't she want my breast?!
NO! Or, cut!You know, that's your call!
She's steaming her dress, why? What's up?
Come on. How can I just tell him? What about Julie?
Did they mention that I'm rubber and you're glue?
Well, it was a little extravagant, but I a pretty good deal.
What? C'mon you guys, I don't care, I have a date tonight.
What do you mean? You've been in my room before!
Yah! She's... uhm... not very good though...
Oh wow! That deserves another piece of candy.
..so, he said it was just a sprain, and that was it.
All right, cut, let's pick again, pick again.
Ugh, okay, well somebody will come and save us.
So, which of these babies do you think is the ugliest?
Um, Pheebs, so, you guys just dont get along?
No-no, seriously-seriously, what was the especially me part about?
Ohh, there's a picture of her in the yearbook actually.
You really think I didn't say goodbye to you because I don't care?
Because you took three hundred bottles of shampoo?
Well since I'm movin' out and-and you're so beautiful...
Do you have anything that would... get us out of them?
What?! Joey got a turkey stuck on his head?!
Oh yeah? Another night of birdogging the chickas?
That is not true. She did! She forced me!
I mean we're not, we're not gonna live together anymore?
Go-go-go-go, come on! So uh, what did you find out?
Oh, thank God I can't hear a word that you're saying!
Joey! The wedding is in less than an hour!
Well... he happens to be a very nice... guy....
Well, maybe the next batch, we could all get some.
And yet she was worth jeopardising our relationship!!
What a jerk! You want me to kick his ass?
Oh my God! That's the creepiest thing I've ever heard!
"Indeed there isn't"... I should really get back to work.
Umm, I'm sorry. Do you-do you have a problem with me?
How's Ross doing? Y'know since all the Emily stuff.
Well, why do y'know go in that room and do your homework?
I cannot believe that you didn't tell me that we are still married!!
You wanna go in the bedroom? It's a little more comfortable.
You were supposed to be in there so I could see your thing!
My God. Okay. Ha-ha-ha beat ya! Sucker!
Hello. I need to get on the 11 o'clock flight.
Ross! Y'know what, I just got-why? Why did you do this?!
But! Don't you have to give him his money back?
So uh...I guess we should...make it official huh?
Well, I have been spending a lot of time in the lab.
Ohhh, this is the least jealous I've ever been!
I can do that. I certainly did it when we were going out.
We went through a lot of wine tonight, you guys.
Yes, Chandler, that's exactly what it is. It's your hair.
Joey... are you sure? I mean, I know how much you love him!
Oh, wait before you guys go, can I just ask you a question?
Oh, lucky me! Coffee and a live sex show!
Yeah, yeah, I was just about to take a break anyways, so...
Oh... you're not gonna do a magic trick, are ya?
You know what we should all do? Go see a musical.
Y'know, I don't-I don't know. Let me, let me check.
Hey! Oh my God you're here, let me see your hand!!
No, you guys, you really don't have to go, we're done talking.
Ross, thank you. Hey, do you guys wanna go see a movie?
Oh. Look at you making up crap for me. Oh God!
Oh my God! It's Joey Tribbiani of Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.!!!!!!!
Ooh, this is soo sweet, Joey our little twinkle-toes.
Oh God, oh, and then she told the funniest story...
Okay. Okay. Okay. Uh, what do I, what do I do with him?
Okay. Hey, what are you thinking? What are you thinking right now?
Your company has a fine foods division?
Yeah, that was an awesome day! Opening credits.
Well honey, then why don't you break up with one of them?
Shh.. Go back to sleep. I have to go home.
Oh God! Thank God you're home! I'm watching Cujo.
Ok, look, Ross. I do not want Emma going to the playground.
I accidentally packed these with my stuff. Who is this?
Why? Seriously I did not understand a word that you said.
Oh, great could you make me four copies of those?
Oh, I really liked him. Yeah, it was really, really, really good.
Okay honey, now I'm gonna try to listen from right here!
Excuse us for a minute. You didn't tell her to come?!
I... Am I the only one that this is embarrassing for?
Oh y'know what honey? Let's not talk about that right now?
Yeah... Yeah, we can wait, we don't have to do anything tonight.
All right, well that's good to know. Good night, Steve.
Uh-huh, doing it. Doing it. Phone doing it.
Well then you just must have a natural talent for it.
Oh honey thank God you're home, I was getting worried.
Uh, Mon, you-you gonna leave your shoes out here?
All right, you're the boss. I guess I gotta do what you tell me.
Oh wait, Ross, would you just stay and help me get dressed?
What? Wait a minute, I didn't pay, I thought you paid!
Oh hi, Mr. Wineburg, hi Mrs. Wineburg.
But ah, you're safe from it if it's in the freezer?
Okay fine, I did. But I didn't see anything, I swear.
Yeah, I-I-I-I'm funny Ben, but I'm not stupid. Okay?
Well, we were going to do that after-I mean umm, next.
Ooh, your lips are so soft... Do that again...
Y'know what? I don't, I don't think Phoebe really wants to come.
Jean-Claude she said yes, I'll see you tonight. Thank you.
Please tell me you're not gonna dress up like a dinosaur.
Yeah, looks that way. First ones here! Wooo!!
Oh thank you, Chandler, this is so great, she's gonna love me.
I'm not saying that I'm a lesbian! I'm just saying that this happened!
I was just asking 'cause I need someone to watch Emma tonight.
Hi! Okay, don't be mad at me, but I couldn't resist.
Chandler, aren't you worried about what to get Monica for Christmas?
No, I'm sorry, we're all out of those. Anybody else?
No, no, no, I admire a man who can cry.
OK, Ross, listen to me, I am not yours to save.
They took Ben to the park. Where've you been?
No. She's going to live with us for eight weeks.
That is hard to say, Ross. That is hard to say.
I don't know! I'm-I'm kinda thinking it-it was the lobster...
Well that sounds kinda cool, kinda like The Hobbit.
Look, Chandler, he has moved on, OK, you have to too.
So does it really hurt as bad as they say?
It'll never last, he's just a rebound roommate.
There's not gonna be a wedding. Ross and I are not getting married.
You know, this happens all the time to my computer at work.
Thank you doctor. Oh thank you for being so nice and calm.
Ross, hey you know what might make it less boring?
Ya know, in crazy world, that means you're married.
Yeah. Oh! Was how you invented the cotton gin?!
Oh, little 'X's! Great! That makes up for everything!
Oh, oh, oh, I'll get 'Rainy Day Bear'!!
Whatever happened to just singing for no reason? Huh?
Okay. . Hello Drake, I'm surprised to see you here.
Well, I'm gonna take a nap, turkey makes me sleepy.
Yeah well, Ross just made plans for the whole century.
No, I haven't had a chance to be alone with him yet.
Oh sorry, hold on. Let me just check on the baby!
Oh, I guess. Except everything looks like jammies now.
Honey, I'm sorry, but he's right. I love you, but you're crazy.
Ross, seriously! You've gotta go to an appropriate doctor.
Yeah! It's weird. But the thing is need to find a date.
I know. Days of Our Lives, thank you very much.
Yeah, and-and you better make sure he tips you this time.
Oh, no, no, I don't have one. I just need to talk to my friend.
Oh thank you! Thank you, thank you, thank you! Emily?
OK, OK. So, you ever get a pet with a girlfriend?
And y'know what else, oh my God, are they gonna love you.
No, no, not at the moment, no, I'm not. Are you?
I am so gonna miss watching you freak people out like that!
Monica, you should totally put your name down on the list
No that's just--That's just 'cause I'm such a good messer!
Oh, it's so sad they never had a chance to meet.
Oo, I can't watch this, it's like Sophie's Choice.
Okay, uhh, I think I'm going to run to the ladies room.
Ooh, and it's so nice having this little sink here...
Huh-huh, no act--no, uhh, that, that is basil.
I knew it! I knew it. Come on tell me your moves.
You just don't look old enough to have a twenty-year-old daughter.
It's not a miracle Joey! I'm sure there's some explanation.
Great, people having sex, that's just what I need to see.
Okay, in about ten seconds you're gonna see him kiss me.
So, what, you're just, you're just okay with being flaky?
Hey! Ross, listen can you come to a charity event tonight?
I knew that! I knew that! I was just messin' with you too!
Oh, thank you that's very helpful, I'm glad you came over.
Uh-hmm, uh-hmm, yeah, yeah, I really liked your hands.
Oh yeah, what department was that? The Jerk department?
Oh, big glamour night. Me and Monica at Laundorama.
Wait, we won't know that until we do it, will we?
Honey, stop it! I am not going to tell you until I tell him.
Alright, fine, you go ahead and you do that, alright Ross.
You don't understand! You didn't see how brazen she was.
Phoebe you can't have both of them! You have to pick one!
Okay. Hey. Umm. Does everybody hate these shoes?
And sorta just put the receipt back in your pocket?
I'm sorry, I was just thinking you're day could still pick up.
I am not gonna get fired, because I'm not gonna act on it.
Yes, but you can not tell Ross 'cause I want to surprise him.
I'm not telling you what to do! I am telling you what not to do!
Where am I gonna get a cowgirl outfit on Thanksgiving?
Oh, wow! Congratulations, that's quite a waste of time.
Okay, you look in the kitchen, I will look in the back closet.
No, actually I took it off then I drew it back on.
On someone's lips? Where'd you get the hickey?
That's easy for you to say, you weren't almost just killed.
Oh! Oh, I just thought of the greatest wedding gift to get you.
Well, in my defense, you were not supposed to tell each other.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, quit making up rules!
All right, well, everybody just remember where they were sitting.
I don't know... I mean, I've never looked at you that way before.
Oh, yes! We'll have ourselves a little baby Ruth...
Oh yeah well, you know me, babies, responsibilities, ahhh!!!
Because you are my sister and Ross and I have this huge history...
So did I. I'm really glad Monica asked us out.
But mom, I really know what I'm doing. I can handle this.
And the ring, was the size of my fist !
God. I have never been so uncomfortable in my entire life!
Thank you. OK. Machine. Just waiting for the beep.
Phoebe, it's me. I'm going to hunt you down and kill you!
Oh, sure! Do you need me to train somebody new?
Yeah and you had fun teaching him how to be all Joey.
Yeah, it is! But you're just a kid! I mean you're 25!
Okay, see now I'm scared because I don't actually think you're kidding.
Huh. Wow, I wouldn't think Hobbs would like that so much.
So how is the uhm... baby styling business going?
Oh, no, no, no. Presents first. Food later.
Or. We could put a hat on his head.
I am not horsing around okay? I am Porsching around.
I am soo not going to do good on my SATs tomorrow.
Oh! Really? Do you wanna try some of them on for me?
Well, the first time didn't really count... I mean, y'know, 's'Barry.
Wow, everything looks so good! I think I'm gonna have the chicken.
Yes, my sister's giving us her place for the weekend.
Please! We did not fog Danny! Who's Danny?
Oh it's umm, it's tofu cake. Do you want some?
It is our first official date. Our first date.
You, you, you said he liked me. You, you slowpokes!
Hi. Umm, I think there's something that we really need to talk about.
Y'know what, you are mean boys, who are just being mean!
So you'll definitely get onstage, even if you don't win.
Yeah, all right. All right! Just keep walkin'! All right?
Just when you thought that dude couldn't get any wierder.
Wow. Well, I guess it was Cupid who brought her here.
Oh, wait, Joshua! Joshua! Yeah, well, that oughta do it.
Well, I'll be waiting for you, just come up when you're done.
Joey, would you just come out here and stop being such a baby!
Ahhhh , you brought rats to my birthday party?
Pheebs, if I had never met him this never would have happened!
Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing?
All right Monica, do you want to know why I was with Ross tonight?!
Uh...no. No, no, in fact, you're not having a boy.
Oh, Phoebe, I'm sorry! Phoebe has prepared something as well.
Maybe it was just the kind of story where you have to be there.
Oh, really, really? Well, it wasn't very good for me either.
I could, I could but I don't want to! I want to kiss Joey!
I'm so not impressed. Everybody snacks when they shop.
Thank you. Oh Joey and look at this crib! It's so cute!
Chandler, what are you doing? There is a trash can right there.
Honey, we have to go. Our reservations are at 8:00.
You're so sweet. Oh my God! And you gave the baby Hugsy!
Oh great! Suddenly she sounds like a biblical whore.
You walked around all night in the city by yourself?
Would you excuse me, please? I'm trying to have a date here.
I'm sorry, this sounds like something I'm never gonna be interested in.
Aahh, I'm a... chef at a restaurant uptown.
Tommy's supposed to be here soon, we're going to lunch.
Oh, OH! Wow, I love those! Where did you get them?
Yeah, I'm not so sure you should be here when he comes up.
She's actually very sweet and we used to be very close.
Joey, why don't you just tell her what happened? It's not your fault.
Hi. What are you doing here? Isn't this against the rules?
Well, I gotta get up early and it's almost seven o'clock.
Well, last night you seemed to know your way around the table.
Wait no, honey, honey throw it to me, throw it to me.
Look Ross, if you're so freaked out, just get in the car!
Ross, you got that for free from the museum gift shop.
Well, I'm sorry I went out with him when I knew you liked him.
I'm sorry honey, I'm just having a, having a rough day.
Yes! I'd love to! Have her come by the office.
Well, so, now, do you guys have a lot of big plans?
Oh, not as a friend, Phoebe!! Fine, I won't use it!
Ross, I am telling you that she is using you to get back at me!
Wait a minute! What do you mean, you're taking over my job?
Oh, Joey, you know what, no-one is gonna be able to tell.
Maybe. But just a little one. Phoebe got the whole world.
Well, then, you know, couldn't she have just copied my haircut?
Okay, well, that's one less thing we have to do on Monday.
You can't just say, 'Nice to meet you, good night?'
Well, sure! Come in! Well, what-what happened to your girlfriend?
I know. At dusk. That's such a hard time for me.
Oh yeah? Startin' to feel her again there are we?
Umm, well let's see uh, this one is Tom Brokaw.
Oh. Do you want to watch the rest of the movie with me?
Okay, all right, give me the mug! I'll keep the mug.
Well, hon-ey. I'm just trying to look nice for your big night.
Oh god, waddawe do, waddawe do, waddawe do?
She's ok, I just don't get a really good vibe from her!
No Ross! Ross! Ross! My child has no father!
Yeah, y'know what? Don't look at it. Seriously, don't look at it.
Yeah, and you know what? You're right, I do feel better, thank you Ross.
Well, I like the pretty little drawing of you in the wedding dress.
Oh my god, I can't believe you let me put this in my mouth.
Joey! It is an auction! You don't guess, you buy!
Well, no. That's impossible. You can never be too Alan.
Is there room on that step for a pathetic loser?
Oh, hi Mrs. Lynch! Is Joanna in already?
No, he said we were holding up the people behind us.
I didn't see anything! I actually changed my mind about the name.
Ohh, I just don't think I have enough left on my credit card.
All right. Well, if I gonna do this, I'd better keep going.
Yeah, they were very y'know...wrestley. But, I guess that's normal?
Hey-hey, now he's showing us his poking device.
Phoebe, your in pain, would you just go to the dentist, just go.
Ugh, horrible! I did the stupidest, most embarrassing thing!
So that there will be a decent place for me to sit.
That's great, great. So do you have any questions for us?
From the guy in the bar, why didn't I get that message?
I was faking it! Can't you tell when I'm being fake?
Um, excuse me Gavin, I have a question I need to ask you.
My boss, Joanna? Wow, that must've been awkward.
Oh my God! Oh my God! I can't go! I'm gonna be too nervous!
We're waiting for you to open the door. You got the keys.
In case you didn't notice, that is a scary man.
: Step away from the crib, I have a weapon!
Now! Give him the sandwich! Give him the sandwich!
All right, first name on the speed dial is mom.
Monica, nothing has even happened yet, and you're already so...
You know, I'm thinking about letting Emma have her first cookie.
Well first, for forgetting to throw you a bridal shower.
What?! You-you actually thought that basket was gonna get you the apartment?
Oh, Ross, c'mon. It's my fault, I almost lost your...
Well, I told him I would think about it, but I'm gonna tell him no.
So I'll bring her by around seven? Is that okay?
No, these aren't all my suitcases. This one's Paolo's.
No honey, we're sorry, we didn't mean it. I love you. I love you.
I'm so sorry! No I'm sorry! No I'm sorry! No I'm sorry!
I'm not gonna gooo, so I think that will accomplish the not going.
Joey stop staring! There's nothing there! It's not true!
I-I am not uptight-Hey-hey-hey-oh-oh! Listen, I am not uptight, man.
No, no, thats OK. Y'know, I think I'm gonna give it a go.
Hey! How's it going? Did you make any new friends?
C'mon, you guys, what're we gonna do, what're we gonna do?
well watching sharks? Are you sure that's what he was doing?
I'm not! This is what I'm doing now. I've got this job-
Well, isn't that a good thing? You said you were sick of this.
What? What do you mean, "there you are"? Where was she?
Noo! Oh God we did-we didn't, we didn't uhh...
I know, I just didn't want to wear my glasses on my first date.
So forcing her to marry Bobby is gonna make that happen?
Oh it's OK. You were worth the wait, and I don't just mean tonight.
Oh yeah, Joey broke it. Had to get rid of it.
oh oh! What is up with Miss Hawaiian Tropic?
Oh, that would be great! I love him, I love him, I love him...
I'm sorry, too! OH GOD! I shouldn't have said anything!
Well, I used to date him, but you're still going out with her!
Yeah. I'm gonna have a baby. I'm gonna have a baby. I'm gonna have a baby!
Ooh! My Chinese food! Let me get my cash!
Really?! Got a little crush on Tag there do ya?
Eavesdropping. Pheebs, the ceiling tiles were falling down.
So uh, heard you had some fun with Tag last night.
Oh my God Ross! What in heaven's name are you doing here?
Look! This is ridiculous. We should be packing you!!
God, oh God Monica, I forgot. This is our first date.
Awww, no, it's okay, we've actually known for a while.
Oh God. Oh I can't believe Joey Tribbiani heard me throw up!
I would love to live with you Ross; that's-that's great! Thank you!
Hi, I'm sorry, I need to borrow your phone for just one minute.
And while I'm gone don't you boys sneak a taste.
So umm, you're gonna stay with me as long as I need you?
OK, you wanna play? OK, let's play, let's play.
Wait, you can't go away this weekend! It's Emma's birthday!
You had to do it, didn't you? You couldn't just leave it alone.
Joey, do you have peanut butter on the back of your head?
See Pheebs, I promised you no one would die, didn't I?
Honey, you can say it, Poconos, Poconos, it's like Poc-o-nos
All right I know, I know how it looks Pheebs, but I'm telling you...
Wow, a Swedish massage from a real Swedish person.
So did they call you to tell you your name's gonna be in this?
Oh but Joey, I have to go. There's no room for a baby here.
And I hope Barry doesn't kill you and eat you in Aruba.
I'm gonna throw this away, but thank you so much for the gesture!
No. No, she told me his name was Ken Adams.
Well guys tend to get naked before they're gonna have sex.
Okay, walk us through it, honey, walk us through it.
Joey, I think everyone saw the wine come out of your nose.
Maybe Joey's right. Maybe all good deeds are selfish.
Yes, you have to get her something, and it should be something really nice.
No, the other thing. I really think it's great they work things out.
Shoot, shoot, this is never gonna work! He's right there!
Oh, no, no! I heard you before, that is so not what this is!
How does going to a strip club help him better?
Uh- which one of us are you talking to there, Barr?
Oh, y'know what? I can't. I have to have dinner with that Melissa girl.
Fine. Hi! Yes, I'd like to order a large pizza.
What?! Joey, you don't want to go on a date with a pregnant lady.
Wow. Wow, that's great. Great. Ok, wow, you know what.
Hey! Have you guys seen Jill? I can't find her anywhere.
I just, Phoebe, said y'know thought she saw something between you guys.
No Phoebe, I am not letting you put makeup on my baby!
Anyway sweetie, I am, I'm so sorry I ruined your night.
You give me back my sweater or it's handbag marinara.
Yeah? Wow! Y'know, that this thing has speakers in the headrest!
What are you? Monica!! Stop it!! Oh my God! Stop it!
Noo, that's our unbelievably loud upstairs neighbor.
Why would you even want to come Ross? You're a horrible skier.
Sure, I'll just sit next to the trans-sexual from purchasing.
O-okay, now see, you never ever ever told us that...
Yes, Joanna really has been an incredible mentor to me.
"Well, but I'm not sure I really want to do anything about it."
Well maybe it would make me feel better if I slept with Joey.
Oh! Well let's look for them. Oh-oh-hey! Are these them?
I mean I got news for you mister, Emma? Not easy.
Nothing! Oh God, we're just so excited that you want to get this apartment!
Hey Ross! Check it out! I learned a new trick!
Yeah, but it's okay, because when Ross left Mark came over.
Yeah, I-I heard. I think it's great! Ohh, I'm so happy for you!
Oh-oh, Pottery Barn! You can throw the rest away.
Oh! Well you're just the prettiest ballerina I've ever seen.
I just- I don't think us getting back together is a good idea.
Okay. Okay, that's him! That's him! That's Cujo! That's Cujo!
And do you remember going into my purse and stealing the phone?!
Hi. Tag, I have a conference call today is that correct?
Alright, just put your hands out and I'll back up into them.
Am I the only one who doesn't think that she's hot? Ross?
Awww, stop. Come on. Now go shave that head!
Ok, I just, I just really need to be with myself right now. I'm sorry.
Y'know you're-you're probably wondering about the old date on there.
Look, Ross, he's just... Sandy is just sensitive, that's all.
I don't care! The wires have come loose in your head!
Dad, dad. We got it!! We Got It!!!
Oh my God, its happening. It's already started. I'm Kip.
Hi! Thanks, hey so uh what'd you do last night?
Okay. Oh wait! Umm, did you send those contracts to Milan?
It's my father. He wants to give me a Mercedes convertible.
I mean why, of all people would you want to go out with Chip?!
Oh my God! I can't believe you guys are actually think you're moving in here!
Oh my God! It sure didn't look this way when I lived here.
Oh...see... but Joanne loved Chachi! That's the difference!
Shhhhh! Phoebe! All right, look. I have a little thing for him.
Oh, oh my God! I can practically hear the mahjong tiles!
Oooooh. : Oh! I got an interview! I got an interview!
Oh, umm, okay, yeah, I'll be, yeah I'll be right back.
Oh my God! Was she old? Does she have a view?
Assistant buyer. Oh! I would be shopping... for a living!
I will not! I'm the divisional head of men's sportswear!
Ok. Oh God. Get the camera, it's in the diaper bag.
Oh, ok, thank you. Do you see what all the guys see in her?
Joey! Why did we have to rush out of there so fast?!
Yeah, I don't know who I was kidding. I can barely use chopsticks.
G.I. Joe? Do you really think he's gonna fall for that?
Well, I have to say that earns tutu pieces of candy.
Which you're not, because you've totally hung up on him!
Well, y'know, if-if kids like to play with Capri pants.
Yeah, well just be glad he's not playing a smaller instrument.
What...? Too sensitive to take care of our baby?
Ohh, it's me and La Poo! Wow! I miss that dog.
Oh wait, don't you have to pay for your, Busty Ladies?
Great! It went great. Really great. Hey, is that wine?
Well, y'know, possibly. You didn't tell him that, though? Right?
Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no, that's OK, I don't need them. I'm going for fours.
He's downstairs getting the rest of the stuff out of the cab.
Okay, it's not Relaxi Cab. It's Relaxicab, like taxicab.
Hey, that is the...baby's problem. Oh, everything okay with the waiter?
Oh yeah! Y'know, if it's not a headboard, it's just not worth it.
Ooh... oooh... oh, ah... Can I ask you a question?
After our date last night, did you feel a little weird?
He was a hamster! I am not going to vacuum up my baby!
I mean n-not-not fake at all like most famous people.
Pie in the hood, pie in the hood. Go.
Oh wait, no-no-no! Drag me down. Drag-drag me down.
Just so you know... With us... it's never off the table.
Paul. Umm, I just wanted you to know that Ross really is a great guy.
Thank you Joey. You know what? I'm not even sure I can have caffeine.
Ok, good-bye you guys. Thanks for everything. Oh, sorry! Oh, sorry!
Uh, it's from yore. Like the days of yore. Y'know?
Of course they're listening to you! Everybody listens to you.
Horrible and degrading list of reasons not to be with me?
Look, um, I think we should talk about what happened on the terrace.
Hi, uh, nothing. That horrible woman just took my machine.
Maybe. I-I don't know-Oh God, how could I be so stupid?!
Monica look! Look-look-look! Here is that table that I ordered.
Ross! Phoebe's gonna be here any second, she cannot see this!
Yeah, yeah... It's... "climax your way to better skin".
Careful, watch her hair. WATCH HER HAIR!
Oh, Chandler!! All right, this is it! You never see Joanna again!
He-he said Rachel, right? Do you think I should go up there?
I'll take a coffee. So how was your big date last night?
Okay, do you see, do you see what you're keeping me married too?!
Oh as, as opposed to your other multi-functional nipples?
Umm, or, maybe, I should stay away from all men.
Yeah! Right! Okay, I'll see you guys later. Woo hoo!
Okay uh, but before you do that. I-I, I need you to talk to me.
You are not. You have never been able to break up with her.
Aaah... Ross, actually there's something that I really need to talk to you about.
Nothing else worked. That girl is all about the ass...
Yeah! You can hook it up to your TV and you get radio!
Oh Joey! Joey! No, it's not you! You didn't get anybody pregnant!
Show cat! Quality show cat! Show cat!
No, it was a stupid bet! We were just playing a game!
Hey, do you believe this? Do you believe they are actually getting married?
No! There's no orange juice in there! We win!!
Every day, you are becoming more and more like your mother.
Wow! Umm, y'know, I-I would really love to, but I-I shouldn't.
Oh, I can't believe I ever let him touch me with those fingers.
Well, have you been involved with someone where you haven't broken up?
Joey. Joey, something feels weird and not good weird. I don't-Whoa!!
Wow! They really got you guys. Your T.V. The chairs.
Basically, there's the thing, and then there's the stuff after the thing.
Yes! She's gonna help us take care of the baby! Woo-hoo.
Hi! Ok, you're ready to go pick up Phoebe and go shopping?
You mean the mom you met in Montauk. She was a cat?!
I know. I'm sorry. Look, I'll make a deal with you all right? Okay?
No!! No! He's not married, or involved, with anyone!
Well, for starters I would've said the right name at my wedding!
Oh God, she mu... she must need her diaper changed.
Ralph Lauren called again and they offered me more money.
Okay, Pheebs, you look in the kitchen, I will look in the back closet.
I ah, will buy and wrap all of your Christmas gifts.
Oh God... Okay. Alright. Alright. Okay. Ross, please don't hate me.
Monica, your Sweet Sixteen was like a million years ago.
I've just been thinking about how my baby and I are gonna be all alone.
Oh God! This is silly, I'm gonna see you in a couple of hours!
Yeah, because I was mad at you, not because I stopped loving you!
I woke up today with the biggest smile on my face.
Oh! Oh, I think I'm gonna throw up a little bit. What did you say?
Yeah. It was after the party, we were on the balcony and...
This is easy...Can't do this! Oh! Wow! Seriously I can't do this.
Oh, god, I can't believe one of us actually has one of these.
Oh thank you. Hey y'know, I'm so sorry to hear about you and Elizabeth.
Oh, come on! You think that's gonna work on me?! I invented that!
Hello?! Oh, yeah! This is gonna be a while. Excuse me. Yeah!
Oh really?! Then how come all your stuff is in this box?!
Now, if you will excuse me I am going to go and lie down.
All right, well the place was closed. I'll just copy it later.
Uh, no she doesn't but I can, I can get a message to her.
No. No, I don't. Could you be a dear and go tell him?
Really?! You think so? Y'know, I had just rolled out of bed.
December 26th, huh maybe she's Santa Clause.
No? So you're saying that if I called it, it wouldn't ring?
Well wait a minute, what happened to Days of Our Lives?
Yeah, maybe if you gave this girl a chance it would go somewhere.
That went well. Almost everybody knew that she was a girl.
Well, the cat... the cat turned out to be Paolo's cat!
Oh, I so wanted Ross to know first, but I'm so relieved you guys know.
Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh Chandler!! You guys are gonna be so happy!
Oh, it's a gift certificate to this new SPA in SOHO.
Oops. Sorry! Well, good thing you number all of them, huh?
Yeah it's umm... Yeah it's uh... It-it's y'know-It's nothing.
Vogue! Hey, so tell me about this Jane Eyre woman.
So. I mean, who here does not have the time to get to know Julie?
Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me, excuse me, sorry. Hi.
Bye bye Mike!/Cya mike!/Bye mike!/Bye bye now!
Oh, well, actually we were just talking about me not going to Ross's wedding.
Oh Daddy, no he didn't mean anything by that, he really didn't.
I'm sorry, they were just all coming at me, and I didn't know what to do.
Oh, hey! Hi, there you are, I've been looking for you everywhere!
Yeah it is, it is. We really, really have to do something about that.
Joey, y'know that you could just not throw the sticks up in the air.
Ahh, I don't believe you. I think you don't want them to see you begging me.
Oh, I'm sorry, were you speaking to me or sleeping with someone else?
I lied! And I'm not sick! Just stay behind the curtain!
Did we speak on the phone last night? Did you call me?
Oh, that is so sweet. I think I'm falling in love with you all over again.
Ross, it took you ten years to finally admit you liked me.
He's got this thing. And I keep telling him to go to my chiropractor...
Central Perk is proud to present Miss Phoebe Buffay.
No, no, no, no turtles scare me. I don't need that today.
You are. Well, um... We, we, we were just... Wow!
So uh, apparently people are familiar with the Europe story?
I see your fifty cents... and I raise you... five dollars.
I know but they're just so beautiful! Oh, my God, I just pulled one out.
Kind of ditzy? Too into her looks? Spoiled?
What, as part of your poor friends outreach program?
Pam! Oh God okay, just imagine this, "The Pam."
Hey! Everybody hide! Hide! I saw her! She's coming!
That's fine. So Monica, you are now in control of my love life.
Wow, that's great Ross, I'm sorry we weren't more supportive before.
Oh, well, she's asleep now. Stop forcing that thing on her.
How-how did end up in Vermont with that awful witch?!
...I just don't know if the world is ready for you and your bag.
Sure. I guess. Hey, I hear you don't have to go to London. Yay!
Oh, I probably shouldn't-so I will! Oh! Wow! It's like it's raining!
Don't let him in! I'm supposed to be at a regatta gala.
Yes, you do. When we left, you said, "got the keys."
Oooh... ***I really can't hear what she says*** come here.
No because first they arrest the guy and then they try him.
Hi! Well, we were just about to take off and see a movie. Oh no!
Yeah, sure. All right, whose court is the ball in now?
'Gone for more jars. Back later. Monica Geller.'
I was giving you an appology and you were totally checking her out!
Oh yeah! Oh my God! That is our friend! It's Naked Ross!
Oh no-no-no-no-no, no, no! We, you with someone and me with someone.
Well, I don't get it, but she wanted me to give you her phone number.
Ohh wow! I'm sorry, but Ross you kicked off your shoes!
Sorry, I just uhm... I can't seem to get Ross out of my head...
Oh my God, I'm starting to look like my great aunt, Muriel.
Oh my God, Melissa Warburton. I don't think I have the energy for this.
Well umm, maybe we could uhh... Ah-ha! Too slow!!
I don't care that you left. I'm just glad that you're here. Thanks you guys!
Oh, well, I...It's kind of weird talking to you about this, but...
Guys! Guess what, guess what, guess what, guess what!
Ohh, out, oh God, I don't know why we didn't think to check there!
Yeah, 'cause that's why you won't get Isabella Rosselini, geography.
Why do you care about the guy who won the Paris trip?
I know, that old lady at the end was ready to take you home.
No. Not-not for me, but why don't you take off your sweater?
Wait-wait-wait, I just thought of another story about how nice Ross is!
Yeah! Ohh, I've been waitin' so long to get on that body!
Oh my God, Oh my God, here comes Ross. He's gonna flip out.
Well you uh, you were always really good at the uh, at the uh the stuff.
Come on! Serious-ser-ser-seriously, what did she mean by that? Especially you!
I don't know, I don't know. Urrrgh! Look, maybe we should take a break.
Hi, my name is Rachel Green, I have an appointment for Emma.
All right fine! You're not invited to the party we're gonna have either.
Ohh, thank you for my beautiul earrings, they're perfect. I love you.
Oh no, it's still nap time. But she'll be up soon.
How did we end up with these jerks? We're good people!
So uh, Pheebs, honey, how are those mood swings coming?
Wow! It looks like the Easter Bunny's funeral in here.
Oh, I win! He's got Barney's on his speed dial.
I'm having dinner with my dad tomorrow night, do you wanna come?
Listen, y'know what? I was really freaked out too when I found out...
No! Come on its late, we're not gonna go down to the office.
Ohh-ho-hooohhh. The hair comes out, and the gloves come on.
Oh God. You did. You heard. Ok, listen, let me explain.
Hey, did you guys check out those new hand-dryers in the bathroom?
Okay-okay-okay! So, making things. That sounds like so much fun.
Well, y'know he lost his keys so he was looking for them...
Nothing... It's really... It's nothing... Come here, come here...
Yes, his name is Barry, he's a doctor, thank you very much.
Fancy soap? I thought we were savin' that for the Pope!
Oh hey Ross... Listen, I heard about you and Charlie. I'm really sorry.
No, no, no.... the, um, the... 'love' part?
So ah, did you have fun at the bachelor party last night?
No, it was on the house, it was, it was a newlywed special.
I mean do you have any fun, you know, fantasy type things?
Okay honey, you do realize she only spins like that on ice.
Wow, Monica, you look just like your grandmother. How old was she there?
Wow, this is a tough one. I think I'm gonna have to go with the dog.
Monica, why? Why would I ever want to take away from your night?
Oh yeah. I used to babysit him. Hey, how's his dad?
Ross honey, this is very nice, but, but I-I got a crisis.
Well in High School, that added up to head cheerleader.
Well hello! Welcome to Monica's. May I take your coat?
Ok, I've got one. Wow, those things almost never come true.
Oh! I'm sorry! Are we having an 89-year-old? How about Dayton?
Umm, I think there was a restaurant... I know there was wine. . .
Shhh don't say that loud, Gunther's gonna want to hug me.
Y'know, I gotta tell ya, I just loved your look when you were bald.
Oh look who it is, my husband. The apple of my eye.
Coming! Try under the bed, try under the bed!
Oh does it matter?! All that matters is that you look so handsome.
Well, believe me, it's been a long time since I've been flung.
Joey, is what she just said umm-Oh my God. You were actually gonna...
All right, fine! But I had too! I had to do it for my career!
Umm, when were you gonna tell me that you're going out with Chip Matthews?
But it was beautiful. I mean it was small, but kind of spectacular.
Oh my God, what a great surprise! This is such a beautiful house.
All right, I gotta go to bed. Honey, I had such a wonderful time.
Take 'em! Joey, you can touch them! They're your underwear.
No! Shoot, Dr. Schiff what kind of question is that?!
No, but I was doing my thing and everything was going according to the plan!
What? It's true, my right leg is two inches shorter.
Excuse me! But this is a purebred, show-quality Sphinx cat!
Yes! And he said really mean things that were only partly true.
Ok, that's it! Just give'em to me! I'll split them up!
You may need to use this year to teach Ben about Phoebe.
All right. ALL RIGHT! I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna go to Paris.
Yeah, remember that thing I told you that happened yesterday? Well it didn't happen.
Hi. Well hey, you don't - you don't think they're kind of cool?
Ok well, I heard that! Which means that she heard it too!
Of course! Oh Joey, this ring I...it's beautiful I love it!
Well it's hard to tell... Oh God, if she would just stop moving.
Oh it was perfect! I mean it really felt like he was my friend again.
Yeah, right, he almost danced me right down that...garbage chute.
No, come on, that is a lie. We also kissed in Barbados.
Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. See Phoebe, Phoebe.
Joey, I'm really sorry that I lied to you. I was just trying to make things...
Uh, I don't know. Why don't you put it right here next to my water?
Well, you ripped the paper out of the court reporter's machine!!
Uh-hmm. I'm just thinking about Phoebe; poor knocked up Phoebe.
Oh, what do you, you want me to stop seeing him, is that what you want?
And with Chandler in the next room. What are you, what are you sick?
Ohh! Yeah! Yeah that-that would've been a much simpler problem.
Oh that's right! I'm sorry! I-I am early! Finish! Please!!
What? He said 'we should do it again', that's good, right?
"Dear Rach, you're a great person. Sorry about your tiney-wienie."
Oh wow, uh okay, uh maybe. Umm, yes, I can do that!
Oh my God!! Do it!! Honey, you've waited long enough!!
Y'know, I gotta tell ya, this really does put in a better mood.
Okay, that doesn't help me, because we went to the same high school.
Oh, come on! This is crazy! Can't we just flip a coin?!
No, no, no, wait! Okay, okay. Don't! I'll go, I'll go!
Well, it's a long story, but umm I broke Joey's chair...
Okay, then y'know what? Help me! I need help! I can't do this!
But Joey the baby is going to be crying, it's going to be loud.
Excuse me, Dr. Bobby happens to be an excellent doctor.
Okay, well that's now the third sign that I should not leave Emma.
Come on apartment! Come on apartment! Oh! I know queen is high!
Please, Ross, you-you got hurt playing badminton with my dad.
Yeah? Well, you should know. You've bought like a billion of 'em.
Oh, great. Although I did sit down where there wasn't a chair.
Pheebs is your grandmother maybe saying that you should live here alone?
Oh, come on! I'll give you ten free Ralph Lauren shirts.
You pierced her ears? How could you do this without telling me?
It's left sweetie, but that's okay sweetie, that's a tough one.
We don't want it-it to be too much, we want it to be subtle.
Ohh, he's married! Ross is married. I can't-I still can't believe it.
Oh, and somebody can get those leather pants she's always wanted!
No-no, they just had a big blowout over what to do with my room.
Well, I-I-I've been on Standby for a flight home for hours.
What?! Me?! What about you and your consummated like bunnies nonsense!
What-what, wait a minute, you don't think that's why he wants me back?
Ok... uh... maybe you're not always going after the wrong girl...
I mean is that woman capable of talking about anything else but sex?
Well then Joey, what the hell were you doing with an engagement ring?!
C'mon, seriously, you guys, you're not going to make me watch this alone!
Ahhh, I think you look great! That bag is gonna get you that part.
Ohh! I would kill for a salmon skin roll right now!
I'm trying to put Emma down for a nap, have you seen Hugsy?
Hey Joey, is this the bed where Olivia lost her virginity?
Phoebe! You picked Joey and Ross?! You can not have two backups!
Yes! Great! Give me those cigs! Give it! Give it!
Ooh, Pheebs, what are you gonna say? Are you gonna tell him who you are?
Well, you're the one who wants to fire him, so you're gonna have to do it.
Okay. All right, that's true! But y'know I just don't embarrass that easily.
Yeah and we'll drop it off downstairs so that we're not tempted.
So that we would have something to talk about! So it wouldn't be awkward!
That would be great! Wait, how long is Denise gone for?
I cannot believe you guys! He was really nice and he left because of you!
No, hey, come on, if he asked you first, that's only fair.
I can't believe I don't get to go to my own prom, this is so harsh.
I'm more than okay, I am really, really happy! Wanna know why?
No, I-I-I-I don't, I actually don't know who I'm talking about! So!
Yes, we are very sorry to tell you this, but you, Phoebe, are flaky.
Joey! Why did you tell Chandler that Monica was getting a boob job?
That was surreal. Okay, what do think? Are you interested at all?
Well, it's embarrassing. People were looking at us like we were crazy.
Well, you might want to tell him it sounds like his wife is gay.
Yeah fun? Great! So uh, so did you guys hit it off?
That was one time, Ross, and they were only like 5 milligrams.
He was right there. He got down on one knee and proposed.
All right! Y'know what? That's it! You wanna do it?! Let's do it!
Oh! That's interesting, since she died seven years ago!!
No, why do we always have to do everything according to your time table?
Oh. Hi. We just found this cat and we're looking for the owner.
Oh. Oh, those little clunky Amish things you think go with everything.
Oh my God! Yes, I would love that, oh, that is soo sweet, Joey.
Anyway, they want to take us out Saturday night! What do you say?
Oh my God! That's my boss. You have to seat us somewhere else.
No need!! Problem solved, we are powering through .
Hey look-look, Phoebe's talking to uh, Cute Coffeehouse Guy.
It's a shame though, I mean, when we did it, it was pretty good.
To Monica and Chandler... and that knocked up girl in Ohio.
That's not her name! I'm sorry, she just doesn't feel like an Isabella.
I feel like we're the only two people in the world. Oops. Sorry.
All right honey, we'd better go if we wanna catch that movie.
Full, dry, on its back, and no loose covers.
Since when, since when do you think I don't wear enough of this?
You know that depends on what it is! I've done a lot of stuff.
Yeah, he thought he broke your chair so he switched the chairs!
Joey, y'know you get any mustard on that bag, you can't return it.
I'm fourth! Look at you with your little maple syrup award!
'Cause I know he's gonna flip out and I hate it when he's angry.
No, it's not that. I got fired today. And I didn't get the other job.
That's your, that's your dad's bedroom. That's your dad's bedroom!
Oh, thank you for doing that. I just can't deal with this just quite yet.
Oh yeah! Actually, that's one of the reasons why we're not a couple.
Just think, in a couple of years we get to turn into them.
Yeah, I guess. I-I... I mean, do-do you think we're ever gonna have that?
Oh well actually gonna use a nanny and uh, I don't even have a housekeeper.
I can see that. You look like you slept with a hanger in your mouth.
No, you're not an idiot, Ross. You're a guy very much in love.
Wow! I definitely did not see that one backfiring! I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
Ross, you have to understand that your nice thing makes us feel this big.
Yeah, at the lecture, I told you that last week, you said you didn't mind.
Oh, that is so hot. She walks around him to the other side)
So, if-if I mess this up, there's nothing else for dessert?
No one! They are my friends, I wouldn't punch any of them.
Uh... Oh, Mindy, you are so stupid. Oh, we are both so stupid.
Okay Ross that's fine, but can you please stand near my head?
So, pretty much around the same time that you started telling this story.
Joey, you can't keep this to yourself, if you know about this, you have to tell him.
Oh yeah. Right. So now, are-do you, do you still do music?
What is my sister doing there?! And why are the drapes shut?!
'Okay. Okay, daddy we'll see you tomorrow night. Okay bye-bye.'
Oh! What a great way to earn some extra pocket money.
Oh, well, that's, that's mighty big of you, Ross. I said don't go!
Yeah! Especially not with all of these knives and cookbooks around...
Ross I-We tried all the spicy food. It's not working.
Hey, you guys! Guess what? Barry and Mindy are getting a divorce!
Y'know, I figure if I can make coffee, there isn't anything I can't do.
Umm, well I would have to say that it's a, it's tragic love story.
You know what, I can't do this. I don't know which one of you guys to pick.
Oh no, I think I'm gonna go home and eat ten candy bars.
And now, y'know, I'm like... I'm like the other woman! I feel so..
I'm not going to sleep with Ralph Lauren. I mean, I could, but I wouldn't.
When you're sick, you do whatever you can to make yourself feel better!
You're lookin' at it upside down-y'know what? It doesn't matter.
I don't know. He was cute, and he liked me. It was an impulse.
Chandler honey, I'm sorry. Ok, can we watch Joey's show now please?
My God, I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I didn't mean to do that! I wouldn't do that!
All right! Ross, do you think it's easy for me to see you with somebody else?
Or...I could call in sick and not deal with it at all...
Okay, so let's play for some pepper! Stop spending my money!
Oh my God you're amazing! Did you just pull that out of her purse?
Hi. Thanks for the party, honey. Should I help you clean up?
Oh, wait and on the nineteenth a secret crush announces itself.
What you got there? Something else that's not yours that you can break?
No! So I can be by myself. Y'know? Have a little alone time.
Ok, Barry's letters. Adam Ritter's boxer shorts.
Okay! I was thinking if it's a girl, how about Sandrine? It's French.
Okay, that sounds fair. It just means that once again we can't...
I mean, it-it was like, it was like he made us into a team.
Yeah, just give me a minute! Oh well, yes, I can think of one good thing.
Why? Just because you're not mature enough to understand something like that?!
Oh y'know what, we don't have to talk about work. We can talk about anything!
We... We are not... ...going to let it... be a problem.
Okay. Yeah, that would be nice actually, to have the apartment to myself for a night.
Look Daddy, it's my life. Well maybe I'll just stay here with Monica.
What's that song? It has been in my head all day long.
Ohhh! Wow! He kinda takes your breath away doesn't he?
I heard it from my friend Irene who heard it from some guy!
Ok actually Mon, Matthew was just giving me his phone number.
She is so cute! You could fit her right in your little pocket!
Well, I feel fine, but I think you're bumming out the rest of the kids.
Oh yeah. Okay, see mom, the truth is I can do this on my own.
Hey! Well, I had to give the kid fifty bucks to stop crying.
I know. I know, but y'know condoms only work like 97% of the time.
How would you feel about taking out my assistant Tag? I'll pay.
Mon. I wish I could, but I've made plans to walk around.
They had to reduce it because of, of my deviated septum.
Oh! Yay! Look! There's a piece that doesn't have floor on it!
I mean maybe you didn't hear about a serious relationship called me and Joshua?
You get away from me!! You sick, sick, sick, sick-o!!
Yeah, they said he's gonna be fine, but he's still heavily sedated.
I mean, you know... Ross and I haven't dated in like... six years...
Ross! I think she is trying to make something happen with you to get back at me!
Oh my God!! You guys have such problems!! I feel so terrible for you!
Yeah, but Mon that's totally different. He was you're health teacher.
So do you uh, think we can get you one of those uh, uniform things?
Ohh, okay. Wh-Ah-ha! Wait a minute. Uh Ben, I can't do it.
Ross!! Oh my--ugh!! You kept count?! You are such a loser!
Come on, please?! I'm boredddd! You let me do it once before.
Oh we did, but my mom got us the greatest gift of all.
Okay, y'know what uh, actually, that's great. That helps a lot. Thanks.
Well, these aren't mine. Maybe Monica used to use them with...
Yes your honor, and here are, are forms, all filled out.
That's all right. I mean hard is it to get a couple drinks right, huh?
I know what this is all about... You've always been jealous of my hair.
Well, why shouldn't I be? I have great friends! I have a wonderful job!
Monica, you don't even have a bed, you sleep in a ball on the floor!
We can't find Chandler...-'s vest. We can't find Chandler's vest.
No, I don't! Ross, I think I'm just a more secure person than you are.
No, not really. I mean you've seen me naked hundreds of times.
It's not kicking right now. Although we would love to see you do that again.
What-Pheebs?! Two dates in one day? That's so unlike you.
What are you talking about Pheebs? I don't... Oh my God, you drew on me?!
Wait a minute. Do you not like all dogs? I mean, not even puppies?
What, so I can't lokk nice? There might be doctors there.
Now, she thinks that I made out with him and I did it to get her job.
Oh, ah nothin'. I just felt like hangin' out here and reading.
She's right. She's right. You are no different than the rest of them.
No. Oh, oh, I guess it would be different if I were- with somebody.
Ah! Well it was Joey reading Drake's lines in the dream...
Well, it was just something Josh said about v-necks, but you had to be there.
Oh Joey, I can't believe you brought my boss into this! I'm gonna get fired!
Well, I think you're forgetting the kinkiest former resident of that room.
Huh. Except, Phoebe's not gonna be the one that gets to dress them.
Hi! You might not remember us, but we are the girls that fogged you.
Well Chandler, what is this very weird, metal A Z thing?
No! No-no, no-no-no, very quiet, said with love, no yelling.
No seriously! Seriously! What has happened to the sanctity of marriage?
Huh... OH MY GOD IT'S BRUSSELS SPROUTS.
I... It just-it took me so long to get that desk organized.
I don't know, I'm sorry, I always slept in the back when we drove up here.
Oh, no no no no. Oh no no no no. I have to do this to her?
So what should we do? Should we start looking for a new place?
Oh! Well, as a single woman, who is available, I think you look great!
Hey, there was one Italian guy, OK, and do you even have a point?
NO but Ross. We are never gonna happen, OK. Accept that.
Whoa, that Diet Coke just went straight to my head! Woo!
Chandler, I'm not gonna lie to ya, but I am gonna run away from you.
Okay Ross, we're-wait a minute. Umm, I uh, I kinda have a little confession.
Oh... Oh, I'm sorry! I'm not... I was just-I was just reading to Emma.
So who's idea was it to put everybody in the diner on skates?
Oh God, I hate my job, I hate it, I hate my job, I hate it.
For every night that you're asleep before I get home from work...
It just might be too hard, given the history and all that...
Uh, I don't have any brothers so I don't know, but uh, did you guys wrestle?
Yeah, it's a real shame you can't make it to that one-woman show tonight.
Ow. I don't want him to wake up alone! I should go to the hospital!
We're not gonna do this, all right? She's just gonna think that we're doin' it.
No, you're not! Last week you thought Ross was trying to kill you!
You knew that our hot, sweaty, writhing bodies were....
Well okay-Well don't ruin it! Just play along at least!
Yeah, yeah, you go talk to your friend. You tell him, "Nice try."
OK, listen, I'm sorry about last night and I really want to make it up to you.
I can not believe he would do that to Mon-Whoa! Joey, do they know that we know?
Okay. Hi Emma. Well, your first birthday is over, and it was really...
No, I have all of the good words. OK, fine, fine, we can switch.
She wants to move in with me and Ross to help take care of the baby.
Umm...that kiss before we left the apartment. That was some-something huh?
Wait a minute! She just made a scene in the middle of the ceremony!
Ah you went one too far. Uh, flowers or balloons?
Pheebs, Monica tripped me, I don't think I can ever run again, ever!
No Mon, you want to put them in concentric circles. I want to do this.
And not one of your coupons for an hour of "Joey Love."
Or Carol! But they're funny to kids and who is it hurting?!
Uhm... you haven't told these guys what they're doing in the wedding yet.
So Mon, when are we gonna meet this new secret waiter man?
Hello? Like he was really gonna send you one? She was a big girl.
Now, you do realize that she's a cartoon, and way out of your league?
No, I've just always wanted to do that. Can you help me clean this up?
Oh, maybe that's Emily calling back to leave the exact same message.
Well, y'know it's just been so long since I've been to Chuckie Cheese.
Yeah actually, I think we're gonna take off too. We rented a movie.
Hi Tag! Hey, so did you have fun with uh, with Joey last night?
N-it wasn't easy, but it's your birthday and I did what I got to do.
Yeah, and you don't mind if I call, because you only want good things for me.
All right, fine. Um, you were not the only one there. Joey was there too.
Y'know what? No. It's not over until someone says, "I do."
I can make you a legend. I can make you this generation's Milton Berle.
Ok I gotta tell ya, it's really weird when you use my whole name.
Well, do you want to hear what actually happened or Joey's lewd version?
Uh-huh. I know. It was just, it was just the perfect way to say goodbye.
Barry was the guy that I was almost married and Mindy was my best friend.
Good-good, don't tell him. Don't tell him. Just have him call me okay?
I don't know, something either trees or disease-Ralph mumbles a lot.
Oh my gosh, wow. Monica. Oh my god. Mom. This is so great.
Ross, she's not weird, she just wants her stuff to be one of a kind.
Joey, what are you doing with the bag? You're audition is not until tomorrow.
Okay, well if I stop playing with Joey and Chandler, can I play with Mark?
Well forget it, I'm not telling that girl anything. That is not my responsibility.
Come on you guys! What are doing?! I thought we were the patch sisters!
No. But I was showing him some cufflinks and I felt his pulse.
Oh no. I mean it. After what just happened, I'm never leaving her again.
I'll take all of your photos and put them into photo albums!
Yes, yes, Bombay is bery, bery nice time of year.
No, I mean with us, you know. I mean, is it supposed to be this... difficult?
With my alignment. I've got one leg shorter than the other.
Uh-huh. Okay. You know what, Joey, I don't think he's ever gonna be okay with this.
My father had an heart attack... ...while I was at Barney's.
Okay, I'll see you back at home, if I ever get a flight out of here.
Yeah, which, by the way Chandler, I would like back one of these days.
Noo!! No! You thought, you actually thought I wanted to have sex with you?!
No, no, that's ok. You won fair and square. I'm so sad!
Anyway, um, I guess this belongs to you. And thank you for giving it to me.
I'm sorry your wife is gay. I guess women aren't that great either.
Nice? They were nice. I mean, that's it? I mean, mittens are nice.
Oh I know, my God, this is so-this rice is so-I am so good.
Oh yeah, I'd actually love a blueberry muffin and a chamomile tea.
Okay. Ooh, my! Woah! Why is that baby torturing that woman?!
Oh Monica that was the best Thanksgiving dinner ever! I think you killed us.
Oh God, oh God, oh God oh God oh God oh God....
Y'know what, I-I have to go talk to her, would you let me just get changed?
Oh, well, you know, they're just separated so, you know, never know, we'll see.
I know, I know! I just can't keep this one in, so I pick up the phone...
Well, I will go to the hospital tomorrow, it'll still be broken then.
Ugh, that was so embarrassing! I can't believe you let me go on and on like that!
I mean Ross all that does is remind us that you are interested in fossils.
What?! The duck?! What the hell did the damn duck do now?!
Well, we were just talkin' about you guys gettin' married and how great it is.
Ohh, nothing, I just wanted to see you. See you and hug you. See you.
Well, if anyone is keeping score, I no longer eat tuna.
Ross is coming over. I think now would be a really good time to talk to him.
Oh thank you so much. Oh oh wait! You forgot your erm...Your game.
Ohh, I mean, we were really drunk. I'm just glad we didn't do anything stupid.
Yeah. Yeah. Oh, but once you find it, ohh it's so worth the wait.
Oh yeah, nothing! These are happy tears! This is just what I wanted.
Do you want me to come over there and sit on you? 'Cause I'll do it.
Well, I didn't get the job at Gucci and I got fired from Ralph Lauren.
Well that is because your eye immediately goes to the big naked man.
Wh-no, but y'know who did stop in here looking for ya, Tennille.
"I'm Monica, I don't get phone messages from interesting people. Ever!"
Yes it is! I saw you guys going at it behind the card catalog!
I'm sorry, you know, maybe I wasn't being clear. Uh, this is our cart.
Ooh! Honey, it can't be that hard, I mean, you've been in love before?
Uh. No.. I was going to let you use my Ralph Lauren discount.
Thank God you're here! You have to help me! Were you just talking to yourself?
Oh, Ross, c'mon, please! Don't make this harder than it already is!
Funny, because I was just gonna go across the hall and write that on Chandler.
OK, OK, that is my favorite sweater, that is my third date sweater.
Well if you go to Disneyland, you don't spend the whole day on the Materhorn.
Yeah, this is Tag. Tag, this is Phoebe. Phoebe, can I see you for a second?
Oh no, I'm good, I don't wanna get that turkey smell all over my hands.
All right. So you're telling me that there is nothing going on between you and Chandler.
Okay Monica, what are you doing? You're gonna lose your job! This is not you!
Did you tell the doctor you did it jumping up and down on your bed?
Come on! I am here to take care of you! What do you need? Anything.
For like a half an hour! Man, you can lie about Sweden!
Ughhhh!! Forget it! This is, this is not how this is supposed to happen.
Did-did you come up here to work on that term paper or something?
Ok... I got a spider. There were two, I picked the bigger one.
That's right, still no baby! Come on people! Please make some room!
Yeah! Can you believe that something that stupid actually got us our apartment back?
Oh thank god, if Phoebe's going, can we please take Emma home?
I know. Yeah, see, there's so much to do and I have so little time to do it in.
Yeah, but I don't know why. Look at me, I'm having such a wonderful time!
Ross, no! There is no way I am leaving this room looking like this!
Yeah, maybe if you're in love. But Ross, we are not in love, are we?
Well, I mean, sure, of course. But... you already gave that to Monica, so...
Well umm, that one is pretty but uh, I just, I just love this fabric Sorry.
I can't believe I ever even tried to help you. You are so beyond help.
Well, there's a kiss that he won't forget for a couple of hours, y'know.
Well, wait a minute! The puss is good! It means it's healing!
Okay, now that is the third time someone has said something like that to me today.
Oh! Good thing Chandler's not here, he always wins at this game.
Hmm. Umm, why do you have a copy of The Shining in your freezer?
Well, we're a little early, the lecture doesn't end for 15 minutes.
Look at that! Look at that! We all do it. Okay, I'm stopping now.
Ooh, so cute, that I'm thinking about jamming this pen in my eye.
She could be out of town. Maybe she'll be gone for months.
Hey! Hey, you guys, I finished the crossword all by myself! Hug me!
Oh no Dr. Long, please come in. This is Ross, he is the father.
You guys, does this look like something the girlfriend of a paleontologist would wear?
Yeah and you stretch 'em out with your big old clown feet.
Phoebe? I'm sorry about the whole lifting out thing. You gotta come with me!
Ok, careful, ok. Oh, she's smiling! Oh my God, she does like it!
Well, y'know what, no, you do not make my decisions because y'know what, you're fired.
All right, okay. Alright, let's give to these babies something to cry about!
Well, you know I'm not surprised. I mean have you seen them together, they're really cute.
Oh, oh thanks. Alright well, now that I'm up I'm going to go to the bathroom.
Ohh no you don't! You got lighting last time, lighting is mine!
Ohh! This is so exciting! Oh God... Come and knock on my door...
Monica, last Saturday night, what happened on Walker Texas Ranger?
Well, basically, lately, I've uh, I've uh, sort of had feelings for you.
That's good enough. Right? Okay, well umm, I'm gonna go look at my books!
Hey, listen, Ronni, how long would you say Chandler's been in the shower?
Okay, so anyway I'm sittin' in my office and guess who walks in.
Hey! Joey, would you mind giving me and Ross a hand moving his couch?
Yeah, we ended up spending the day together and had such a great time!
Hi! Hey, remember how last night we were talking about that movie Cujo?
What? Wait a minute. What are you saying, that I'm a pushover? I'm not a pushover.
Ohh, please! Cooking soothes me. Ahh. So, dig in!
Oh no, I'm sorry, you look a lot different from the last time I-I saw you.
Oh my God, you guys, what am I doing? What am I doing? This is so un-me!
You know what? There is a little part of me that really thought we were gonna win.
Oh My God, Phoebe, that's not Ralph Lauren. That's Kenny the copy guy.
Well, I don't know about that, but some said that I looked like a floating angel.
Honey, no one thinks you're a pansy, but we do think you need a tissue.
All right, all right, well you just blew your chances at dating Bob!
Ummmm.... well, actually I'm already done, but I...I kinda got plans.
Uh, Paul's Caf. They got great food and it's really romantic.
Hey! Out of all of us, who do you think is gonna get married next?
I can't believe Mark didn't call. It's Sunday night, and he didn't call.
Oh, well, it's complicated. I don't actually have a boyfriend. But um. . .
Yeah! Oh by the way, thank you for loaning us Pamela and Yasmine.
All right, I promise. I'll fix this. I swear. I'll-I'll-I'll-I'll talk to her.
Well, sure...just a sec, though, 'cause Paolo's on his way over.
Both of them are here, both of them, both of them are here?
No, he told me. He prefers to leave certain things to the imagination.
Oh my God!! Ohh, that is it! I'm leaving! You are just a horrible person!
Well do you get to look through one of those like, those periscope thingys.
Okay. Oh man, I swear if they sold these at Pottery Barn...
Y'know, with the right pair of pumps, that would be a great little outfit.
Oh my God! We are throwing the most depressing baby shower ever!
Well, if it makes you feel any better, I made a fool out of myself.
Phoebe?! Wait a-but-but she just, she said that Joey was her backup.
Oh, God, do you think she heard? It would be so bad if she heard!
Well, Ross, we were worried about you. We didn't know how you were going to react.
I am sorry! Again... I don't know, I don't know what happened, I must be nervous!
Oh my God! Look what... you made it into a bunny. How did you do that?
He even offered to meet me for lunch tomorrow to prep me for it.
I can imagine you in a short plaid skirt and knee socks.
Ohh, you can say. Come on, I don't want you to feel like you can't tell me things.
Ross! What are you... I'm sorry sir. I just, I think he just really likes you.
You guys, I'm doing the best I can, anyone else is welcome to try.
Y'know who doesn't even like dirty movies? My new boyfriend Joshua.
Well hello! So, when are we gettin' back out on the water matey?
Ugh, you will not believe what that sleaze-ball from Ralph Lauren did too me!
Hey, honey! What's the matter? Fine, I was just trying to be nice! Whoa!
Wow! Tell me something Joey--Whoa! I just fell right off the couch there.
O-kay!! See what you did, I'm gonna be doing it by myself now. Okay?
Well, I usually go... play Tetris on somebody else's computer.
Well-well you can give them to me! I haven't felt my feet in years!
Hello! Oh yeah! Hey! Hold on a second she's right here! It's Chandler.
Oh honey, I'll say good-bye to you at the car if you don't mind the puss.
I can't go to my own prom without a date, I can't, it's too late.
Okay sweetie, you can do it. Just open up and put it in your mouth.
Oh hey-hey wait! How do we fairly decide who gets the phone?
Honey, someday you are gonna make some man the luckiest guy in the world.
Ok, Chandler, Mon, there's only one bananna nut muffin left.
Really! What is with that guy? I mean you'd forgive me if I fogged you.
Ok, thanks Pheebs Oh my God, why have I never tasted these before?!
I cannot believe that after ten years, you do not know ONE thing about me.
Right, you, you only had a year. We only hung out every night.
But my... but my boss cannot see me. I'm interviewing for another job.
That's your new job, day and night, she starts crying I need you here.
Hi guys! This is Josh. Josh, these are my friends, and that's Ross.
Phoebe! It's 6 o'clock in the morning! Why aren't you at Gary's?
OK, you know what, are, are you being like, the blind date guy again?
Ow ow ow. Ow ow ow. Ow ow ow.
A mistake?! What were you trying to put it in? Her purse?!
Wait a minute, you're only giving free stuff away to the pretty girls?
Really? Just casually strewn about in that reckless haphazard manner?
Hey, listen, Joey, about Molly, I really prefer if you didn't go after her.
Because you're not finished yet and I won't have it! Greens do not quit!
What, slept together a year and a half ago? Yeah, I'm all set.
Joey, come on! It doesn't matter, you know, it's not like anything's gonna happen.
Wait! No, that's ridiculous. Come on, he lives three blocks away!
I'm hoping that if she hears it enough it will be her first word.
Ok, let's work from the top down! Just work the bra, Joe!
You see, you look beautiful. For god sakes, dim the lights.
And the fact that you were jeopardising my career never entered your mind?!
Ok, not that you need it but good...GOD!Is that Chase Lassiter?He's straight, right?
I know I had it this morning, and I know I had it when I was in the kitchen with...
Hey, you know, before you said that nothing could happen between us? What changed?
Uh, I think I just did. And uh-oh, here it comes again. Shut up!
Okay honey, you can finish this later we're gonna be late. We gotta go.
OH! Alright, you know what? That's it! I want my share of the tickets !
Oh God I just can not imagine what is gonna happen if Chandler doesn't show up!
Well, from me. And I know it's not your big money song, but it's my favorite.
Ohhh! Well of course I will watch him! We have fun, don't we Ben?
It's not! I'm defrosting a chicken. Oh, I uh sold Mrs. Whiskerson.
Now Joey remember, if you win you have to hug me! You hug me!
Yeah. Yeah. Definitely, well it definitely took me by surprise, but I'm okay.
It's okay. Sometimes, things don't work out the way you'd thought they would.
Thank you! And now if you'll excuse me, I have to go to the rest room.
Wow! Have you ever rescued anyone from a burning building before?
Honey wait, Joey, I'm sorry I mean as terrific as I think you are with it...
Oh Amy, don't cry Amy. Um.. Ross, could I talk to you in private?
And I also wanted you guys to know that I am telling the father today. What? What? What?
Wow, this is so cool, you guys. The entire city is blacked out!
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! I'm sorry, semi-private? We , we asked for a private room.
This bench, it's hollow! I can't believe I never knew that! Oh, the presents!!!
Well, okay, look. I don't know, listen, I don't know what's going on here but let's...
It's okay! It's okay! It kicked once, it'll kick again!
Joey, you're gonna have to stop rushing me, you know what? You don't get any dessert.
Oh, thank God you're here! You have to help me! Were you just talking to yourself?
I mean if you think about it, I mean Ross did learn something from each marriage.
Are ah, having dinner with my Dad tomorrow night, I hope that's okay.
And your lap does not count! Okay? Come on help me move this.
OK Julie, so now let's start with your childhood, what was that like?
Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, why are we so sure that this is a girl?
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Would you stay here with me for a little while?
What?! What?! He was trying to cheer me up! My pony was sick.
No, you're right, you are absolutely right. I mean that makes, that makes everything different.
Oh my God! Did you check your entire desk! Did you check all the drawers!
So, you had a good day huh? Big commission; picked up a daddy.
Well I can do whatever I want! I made her! Come on little girl, hi!
OK, well, you wouldn't let me finish and I was jus- Ow. That hurt
Oh, and Monica gets to keep her? In her house? I am so jealous!
We're just really...very excited about this charity event that we have to go to.
Well, don't look at me! My hair's straight! Straight! Straight! Straight!
Well, I've been up since six. Thanks to somebody's dumb-ass rooster.
What? No! It's not a big deal! I do that too, with my shampoo bottle.
Hey. I've got something that's gonna make you happy. Guess what Gunther found?
Yeah, I-I-I just pulled the tab and I just fogged his yeti ass!
Oh, that's why you got these tickets to that play, to get rid of us??
Yeah, down from seven hundred, you are saving like two hundred bucks!
How do you think this suit would look on an assistant buyer at Bloomingdale's?
No! No, I am not getting in a car with Ross, we will just have to live here!
Well that-y'know it's just uh, I've never done that before. Me and him alone.
Okay please tell me that this is just one of your jokes that you do that I don't get.
Isn't this amazing? I mean, I have never made coffee before in my entire life.
Ross, you are so pathetic. Why can't your son just play with his doll?
And you weren't going to tell us? How did you think you were gonna get away with that?
: Thank you. : I saw your twenty-five, and I raise you... seven.
I will wake you up in a way that's proved very popular in the past.
Well y'know, we have 7 people and like 10 pizzas, what do you think?
Hey Joey, what would you do if someone that you slept with told you that she was pregnant?
You want me to just quit my job so that you can feel like you've got a girlfriend?
No, see this isn't about the movie theatre, this is about you stealing my wind.
Yeah so get ready to hear alot of ehm...boohaki, goshdarnit and brotherpucker.
I ah... Oh! I'll squeeze you fresh orange juice every morning!
You know the book says that whenever she's sleeping I should be sleeping so...
Oh that's not important. The point is, I really-I think everything's gonna be okay.
I don't know! But maybe if we keep that drawer shut, it'll die.
Yeah, honey, maybe you can talk to somebody who's had a baby. Like your mom?
What? Come on, you do what you want to do. Do we always have to do everything together?
Okay... Let me put it this way. Anything from Crabtree and Evelyn?
I don't know. What do you mean last night? Nothing, nothing uh, happened last night.
Ohh... Oh, honey here. Take it all. Monica! We need more candy?
Oh he's dusting me with a fossil brush. He thought it would be funny.
That sounds like a plan. Umm, is there a place I can go freshen up?
Oh, stop that! Don't kid about that! Will all the stars be there?
Wha!? What!? Come on! I found the hardware store all by myself!
Ross, she still has not noticed that the baby's sock is on the ground.
Well that's gross, why don't you just take it outside and throw it in a dumpster?
But what choice did I have. He was keeping my sister in a dungeon!
I'm Monica's maid of honor. Okay? Don't try to blue pin me!
Whoa, wait, listen, I think I'm just gonna talk to Ross about what he think it meant.
Well, I didn't see Joshua last night, but I did punch a girl in the face.
Oh, that's what this is all about? Did you bring her up here to get back at me?
Well, legend has it Joey, that... she comes alive when you're asleep.
Joey, is this that thing that you do when you say you're bad so I'll give you a compliment?
Hey! Ross and I were looking for you! What are we all doing in here? Oh, my!
No, y'know what? Maybe somebody came in here and fixed it! Or something!
Oh, ooh, everything looks delicious. What should I ha-ave? What should I have?
Yes, I know! And Joey knows! But Ross doesn't know so you have to stop screaming!!
Monica, what are you talking about? You don't know the first thing about the stock market.
No. But she did give us some ideas on how to induce labor.
Oh. Well then, you better go take that back because they're gonna charge you for that.
I don't know, y'know? I feel a little umm... No, y'know what? Nevermind, I'm gonna be fine.
Did I say I was done guessing? Okay, thank you for that. Oh wow! What's this?
Oh we were, but that was just a , I mean that was just a big drunken mistake.
I'm sorry, I was just reading the joke below it. Man, that one is funny.
Stop it! I will kill you. I hate the fact that my room is so small.
No, I have two sisters. But one of them has a very masculine energy.
No, you're right. Well, we'll find something. Let's just get you out of that. Come on.
Uh, morning. Do you guys think you could close your eyes for just a sec?
Hey. Whe-ell, look at you, finally got that time machine workin' huh?
No, I'm just kidding I would never do that to you! Okay, everybody, it's trifle time!
Please! During that second time you couldn't have picked her out of a lineup!
So what?! Y'know what? The way I see it--Ow! Son of a bitch!!
I don't care! I wanna meet this guy who's the best sex she ever had!
All right, y'know what, come on, do we really have to watch this while we eat?
Joey? Could you get that? What are you doing here? I thought you were in your room?
Uh-huh, yeah I did, because I wore out my first copy when I was with you.
Everybody, this is Paolo. Paolo, I want you to meet my friends. This is Monica.
And last year is that why you sent us to that medieval times restaurant?
Ohh, are you setting Ross up with someone? Does she have a wedding dress?
No, no-no-no. Phoebe, this was my fault and besides y'know what? I'm fine here.
Oh no, wait a minute, wait, I've got a presentation tomorrow. I can't miss that.
Oh yeah, sorry. Wait honey, so what did you do that made dad cut you off?
And by the way, have I mentioned that back in high school, I was a cow?
Okay, well can't you just try it one more time Ross? For me? For me?
Honey, why don't you sit down? Dina has something that she wants to tell you.
God. I forgot how much I love driving. I have got to get my license renewed.
Oh my God, it's so huge, but you just have to promise me that you cannot tell anyone.
Thanks, but I gotta go to work and get my eyes scratched out by Mindy.
Wow! Look at that, Chip Matthews called. I wonder what he wants?
Well, you know that my parents are out of town and Chip was going to come over...
God, Ross, look, what you and I have is special, all Paolo and I ever had was...
Yes, you did-Oh my God you didn't! Well then why didn't you tell me that before?!
Alright, look, I have to go. I love you, and I will call you the minute I get to Paris.
Oh hell, he's done this three times! He knows what its about!
And so bad. I don't even know what you're talking about because I didn't ask you to do anything!
Okay. So what? You guys would just like get together and like just say mean things about me?
Well, I don't know, you guys figure it out, I got to put Emma down for a nap.
Alright, enough, enough, come on. Let's just all go in at the same time.
Man, don't be surprised if her hands and her feet get bigger too!
Ok, ok, so you're not a fan, but I mean, come on, you cannot do this to her.
Oh, yeah, I had too. There was never any parking by the Psychology building.
Uh... You didn't propose to me, Chandler didn't propose to me, but Joey did.
Oh my God. Can you imagine if there was?! I mean, what would happen exactly.
No! Forget it! I am not gonna ask Frank to give you one of his kids!!
Yeah, well, I guess I have forgotten about Joey and clearly you've forgotten about Chandler!
Yeah, Rachel. And this is Ross' sister, Monica. We met at Thanksgiving. .
Oh, I am, my side still hurts from when you crashed into me yesterday.
Oh my God! Calling from Rome! Bon giorno, caro mio.
No really, she didn't sleep well last night, so we can't wake her up.
If you like looking at butts so much why don't you just go look at a mirror?
Hello? Uh, Rachel. Great, someone is in our apartment. Call the cops!
Ohh! That's so sweet of you! Oh yum! Did you put pickles on this?
Please, make sure she comes. It's really important to me, I mean it's my mom!
Wow, you know what? That is the best fake speech I think I've ever heard.
Ok Sexy, sexy, very sexy, sexy. Alright! Lets do it!
Well uh, yes and no. Except not no. So to sum it up, yeah.
Well, I was kinda supposed to be headed for Aruba on my honeymoon, so nothing!
I just y'know, I didn't expect him to be this happy so soon. Ufff. Ooo-ooh!
No! No, she's-She was nice. I mean, she's a little slutty, but who isn't?
Ye-ah. Yeah! You know, the money's great. It's certainly the easier choice...
No Phoebe! I just need you there for support. I haven't told him I'm pregnant yet.
And you've got lenses! But you hate sticking your finger in your eye!
Y'know what Chandler, you got yourself into those cuffs, you get yourself out of them.
Yeah, and none of these stupid grocery questions, real personal questions.
Well then honey, buy the lamp! Hey, we have that 60 bucks from Ross.
Yeah. Oh, yeah. And I mean, the connection, I mean y'know, emotionally, mentally, physically...
No, you! Phoebe you freaked me out. You kept saying how huge this all is!
And you're gonna want him to eat his heart out so you're gonna have to look fabulous!
I don't know. We were watching TV, and then he pooped in Monica's shoe-
Perfect. Fasten your seatbelts, it's peepee time. Hey, Mr. Trib.
Honey, why is it hard, I mean we've been together for almost a year now?
Monica and Chandler are really moving in here and I have to move out and everything is changing.
Well, y'know what? Actually, I was about to bid on this lovely trip to Paris.
Yeah, and could you please chop some up and just put it right there in the sauce?
Ross! I just had a conversation with her, and she said that she and Joey made a deal!
Okay, oh, here's what you do. Just act like everything around you turns you on.
But I thought that ring stood for Caprice's undying love for her brother.
Yeah, when we're in the audience he doesn't talk to us, but he does wave.
This is the worst date ever. How could you set me up with this creep?
And I still have about five seconds to spare. Okay, that was about seven seconds.
Well yeah, I wish that you would. Well, no it's not in there! How about that drawer?
Look, you know what, I'm sorry, but did you really think that this was going well? What's up?
Monica, y'know what? The only reason I did that was because your party was so boring!
All right, easy mimey, the moment has passed, it ain't gonna happen!
Well, y'know, a little of this, a little of that. Got myself a date tomorrow night.
Well, where is he? He is supposed to be here. What if the baby needs him?
Wow, y'know if Joey and Chandler walked in right now, we could make a fortune!
Oh Ross, come on. He's happily married. His wife just had twins.
Oh my God! Wow! That was fantastic, I almost leaned in. I really almost did!
All right, you know what? I am not leaving here, until you call that plane back!!
Why are you adding, why are you adding, why are you adding, why are you adding?
Oh yes! Thank you very much! Oh that's-that's actually how the French drink it.
Umm, Chandler, you do realize that those ideas are probably already in Monica's head.
No, but it's good, you know, I'm gonna take some time off and do some charity work.
Okay, I'm just gonna go over the basic points just one more time, are you ready?
Do you guys have to go to the new house right away, or do you have some time?
Oh, well, we can hand it to Gunther and he'll put it in lost and found.
Y'know I can't believe I even thought about getting back together again! We are so over!!
Remember I had to leave the room the other day when you had that roast chicken?
Alright, I can't, I can't wait that long. You have to do something-knock that door down!
ah ha ha. ah ha ha. It's forty five.
Yes, absolutely. I would wait and wait. . . then I'd wait some more.
Yeah, kicking a guy in the crotch all morning really takes it out of ya!
That sounds great! I'd love to live at Warren's!! I love Warren! Thank you!
Hey, nice pillow. So now tell me, is this genuine Muppet skin?
What, what, so that you can dance with the woman that stole your credit card?
Well, we were paying for our stuff and this saleswoman just started flirting with him.
Y'know, you-you also could've used uh, lamps and then followed the light.
Yeah! Yeah. They're...they're-they're my friends, uh, Monica Stephanopolus and uh, and Chandler Acidofolus.
I just never thought I would raise this baby all by myself. Pretty dumb huh?
Yeah, we're, we're actually just gonna walk 'cause it's right up there at the Angelica.
Oh my god. Oh my god. Excuse me. Move! Move! Emergency! Excuse me!
Oh, nothing, he's just goofy like that, I actually, hardly notice it anymore.
Oh, you guys, I can't believe this. But I'll leave now, or I'm gonna miss my plane.
Okay, you are crazy! I'm sorry, but she sounded generally upset! I mean, listen!
Yeah? Okay! Good, good, because he's coming. He's coming. Hey, what's up?
Hey Joey, will you please set this up for people to put Emma's presents on?
Wow! I don't remember him. Honey, are you sure you're not talking about your imaginary boyfriend.
Wow, he's cute, Pheebs! But I thought you just started dating that Kindergarten teacher.
All right, listen, missy. If you want this cart, you're gonna have to take me with it!
Hey you guys, this is my sister Amy. This is Chandler, Joey, Phoebe and you know Mon.
All right here he comes. I'm gonna do this, I'm gonna tell him, I'm gonna be strong.
Oh, uhm, excuse me, I'm here to see my father. My name is Rachel Green.
Well you know, after about thirty or forty fights, you kinda catch on.
Well excuse me, my fashion-impaired friends, I am here to tell you that hats are back.
Ross, Chandler wrote something about me on his computer and he won't let me see.
Pheebs, I don't know what to say. I guess the flea market was just better last time.
Do you really not know where I'm going with this? It left! It's one huge room!
Here you go Pheebs. Who else wants one of my special homemade brownies?
Ohh, you should know, this place is a real babe magnet. Wanna make out?
Sure Pheebs, you know, that's what it's there for, emergencies and pretend agents.
Ah yes, but he's very protective of me so you'd better watch yourself.
I mean, do you think there are people who go through life never having that kind of...
Umm, you-you and your sister seem to have umm, a very special bond, and...
You know what I'm going to do? I'm going to get in my sweats, and eat this in bed!
Well Joey, I hate to admit it, your way of sailing is a lot more fun.
Last night! I just felt it and I went into Joey's room and he was sleeping...
She'll be out in a second. So, Chip, how's umm, Amy Welch?
Yeah that's right you weren't thinking! Y'know what? Let me give you something to think about!
You and your stupid fear. I hate your fear. I would like to take you and your fear....
Now, come on, come on, Steve. There must be something that you like about yourself.
Okay, Phoebe, honey, you gotta be kidding. I mean, you know you cannot keep one of these babies!
Well, I'm really sick of your smoking, so I brought something that is going to help you quit.
Well, is Ross home? Maybe I'll just call him to see if he's actually seen her.
Then you're not gonna like what's coming. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Thank you, thank you.
Okay, Pheebs, quick, what shoes should I wear? The black or the purple?
Wow! H-umm! Hi! Yes, uh I'm sorry the models are actually down the hall.
Oh my God! Joey Tribbiani from Days of Our Lives, just walked in here!
Really? Oh thank you! Oh... Oh, would it be completely inappropriate to give you a hug?
...we went back the house and we got really silly and we...we made out.
Well, sure, but they might think it's kinda weird considering I don't work there anymore.
All right, well, you're right, these are the best oatmeal cookies I've ever had.
Okay Joey, we're luffing a little bit, so could you tighten up the cunningham?
Ooh, goooosh, ooh, these are cookies smashed in the sports section.
Wow, oh my God, our child will be beaten to death in the schoolyard.
Yep. Oh, yeah, look you great. Oh yeah. Yeah, this looks great. Umm, so you like it?
Ross did I ever tell you about the time that I went backpacking through Western Europe?
No! You gotta get me out of here Phoebe! These bargain shoppers are crazy!
Remember when we went to Central Park and rented boats?.. That was fun.
All right, fine, but don't get mad at me. It's-it's just a little hard to believe.
Oh! Shoot! Damn it! Where is it? Oh! Oh! I found it! I found it!
Oh but he did say that they found the grandmother wandering down fifth avenue.
Y'know what? I think we can just leave it at that. It's kinda like a symbolic gesture...
Noooo, no, I'm not mad at him. I'm.. I'm not really anything at him anymore.
Monica, what did you mean before when you said you didn't want to talk to anyone, especially me?
Okay, fine! But you know what? If I was in 36D, we would not be having this problem.
Monica, Monica, look at this lamp. Is this tacky or what? We have to have this.
Ok, uh, Billy Dreskin, Pete Carney, Barry, and uh, oh, Paolo.
Ross, there is no pressure on you. Okay? I mean you can as involved as you want.
Okay. Okay. It's-since you've never done it before you can be Monica's made of honor.
Okay, good. Now that since you know, when you come over would you mind actually using it?
Yeah. So Frank, three babies. Whew, that just seems like a lot, huh?
whhh wait, you're gonna leave my party to take care of a box of rats?
No-no! Don't dance for me! Please? Don't! What is the matter with you guys?
Absolutely. Shoop, shoop, shoop. Only a hundred and two dollars to go.
Joey relax! My mother picked her up two hours ago. You were there!
I'm training to be better at a job that I hate, my life officially sucks.
Amy, that's what I was supposed to wear today, that's why I hung it on the door.
Here we go. I'm serving my last cup of coffee. There you go. Enjoy.
I still can't believe you invited Gavin. Allright, he is the last person I want to see.
Okay? Wait okay, tell-tell me that you like him, please? I mean tell me that you like him.
Okay, but taking care of a drunk, naked woman seems like a job for Joey.
Okay, stop what you're doing, I need envelope stuffers, I need stamp lickers.....
On Melanie Griffith in "Working girl". I think what you want is over here.
He just kept asking, and asking, and asking, and asking, and asking, and asking.
Okay, my boss, Joanna, when you left, she started asking questions about you...
Oh Chandler, I know, I know... oh, hey! You can see your nipples through this shirt!
So uh, so did anything happen? Because rumor has it you guys shut the drapes!
Hey! Wait a minute! That was different! I did those things because I was in love with you!
Alright, fine. You can keep it. As long as you don't mind that she's haunted.
Oh, I'm sure gonna miss pretending to laugh at your weird jokes that I don't get.
I know! It's like I'm being punished for not having this disgusting, poisoning habit!
Ooh! Look! Look! Look! Look, there's Joey's picture! This is so exciting!
No I wasn't! You were supposed to tell her to come and I was supposed to bring the cake!
Yeah! And she's comforted by him because she loves her uncle Joey so much.
Okay. What the hell was that? You know what? Don't answer me. I have a date with Danny.
So. Ross, I've bugged him about this a million times, he's not gonna change.
Julie! Julie, isn't that great? I mean, isn't that just kick-you-in-the-crotch, spit-on-your-neck fantastic?
Have I been living with him for too long, or did that all just make sense?
It's still--It's got a tail! Get it out of here! Get it out of here!!
I'm going to find out if he really thinks supermodels are too skinny. Hey, Pheebs!
I mean he was possessive, he was jealous, he could never just let the little things go!
Of course he will! But Chandler the most important thing is you forgive yourself!
Joey! The baby is kicking for the first time! Will you please come feel this?!
These are, these aren't for you. These are for you. Welcome to our country.
No, I know, I know, and I'm sure your little boy is not going to grow up to be one.
Honey, might I suggest watching a little more ESPN and a little less E!?
Honey, this really is an incredible thing to do for them, but there are things to think about.
Oh and it was great to see you too. And you look fantastic, although you missed a button.
What? I'm not you. This may be the only wedding I ever have. I want it to be amazing.
Umm, I said I thought you were a good kisser, and uh, and that I like your tiney-tiny touchie.
Okay, see now, what I just heard, blah-blah-blah, blah-blah-blah-blah-blah, blah-blah-blah, blah, blah.
Yeahh, but, but those really go better with pants. Maybe I should wear pants?
Well Joey, uhm look, I know that she's difficult, but I think it's really good that she's here.
Well, does a good student drink seven beers during his first lesson?
Thanks for lunch, Chandler. Y'know, you didn't have to walk me all the way back up here.
Oh wait-wait-wait!! No! Don't go in there! Don't go in there! I need another soda!
Oh, it is so unfair. It's like that time they promoted Sandra over me at work.
Uh, I-I had a drink with lunch. Did those cost reports come in?
Yes you do, if you're going to make me feel guilty for getting a free massage!
Hey-hey, you guys oh hurry up, get some, there's a whole cart outside...
All right. We figured you might respond this way, so we have a backup offer.
What?! Wait! What are you talking about?! You love their Kung Pao Chicken!
Well lets see. Maybe he knows where Ross is. Hey, how's it going .
Ohh! And I'm one of them!! Wow! Oh, I just cannot believe this! I mean, Joey Tribbiani!
Well, if it makes you feel any better, I wish my date hadn't shown up.
No! Of course we can wait. Alright, so I guess that means good night then?
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You're right, you are a tough guy. You're the toughest palaeontologist I know.
Listen honey, can you keep dad occupied, I'm gonna go talk to mom for a while.
Yeah, we wanted to throw you a big surprise and a great shower, and now you don't have either.
You WHAT? And I missed it? Because I was giving a makeover to that stupid hippie?
Yes it is! It is true! I went, I went after Ross in stupid London.
Yeah, but that just means that he was falling asleep on top of her instead of me.
Well, just because it happened that way for them doesn't mean it has to happen that way for us.
No! No! It's just that all the people in the entire world that I want to talk to are right here.
Sorry!! I just feel bad about all that sleep you're gonna miss wishing you were with me!
Well, you more then me, but he can't stay to mad at me. I mean, I just had his baby.
Oh, you're gonna love this cake. I got it from a bakery in New Jersey, Corino's.
No! Come on! Don't make me go long. Use me. They never cover me.
She spit up. Judy! She spi...Judy! Look alive, Judy! Thank you.
All right. Well listen, if you see Joey will you just tell him uh...tell him I miss him.
Yes, my wind. How do you expect me to grow if you won't let me blow?
Ooooh! Honey, well we'll find you something. Do you wanna wear my black jacket?
Yes you do. You think of it as your apartment, and I'm just somebody who rents a room.
Okay no way, you cannot use that to get the cute guy and the last blueberry muffin.
Can you believe this is already happening? I mean it seems like yesterday they just got engaged.
Oh, yeah, well... Yeah, no use wasting this baby, just lyin' around the house.
Yeah but y'know what they say Mon, "There's no such thing as bad press."
Well, ultimately, I was trying y'know, I-I wanted...tell him y'know, that I'm still in love with him.
...you were 50 minutes late to the class, what did you crawl there?!
She has got so much going on we-we have only two options. We have Friday...
Uh, wait, so you guys are telling me you actually did the routine from eighth grade?
Joey, if you wanna look good, why don't you just come down to the store? I'll help you out.
Oh my God! What if he thinks I'm the kind of girl that-that would just sleep with him?
I don't know, I, I feel like I had a dream about you last night but I, I don't remember.
Oh no-no, no! It's good! It's all good! I-I actually work at Ralph Lauren!
Oh my God, I can't believe this is a real $20,000 check, oh this is just so exciting.
Well, actually Gunther sent me. You're not allowed to have cups out here, it's a thing.
Ok, let me take these cakes back 'cause they're gonna take that out of my paycheck.
I just wanted to let you know I've changed my mind: I'm gonna do it, I'm gonna kiss Joey.
Hey! Hey-hey, now this was no one's fault Pheebs. Okay? It was an accident.
Well, now, wait. Now I'm all freaked out. Come on, you guys will watch it with me.
Ok, ok, Roger was creepy, but he was nothing compared to Pete Carney.
No-no-no! No-no-no! Please Ross, I can't! I can't do it! It's just gonna freak me out!!!
Yeah, we got a lot to do! We gotta think about the flowers, the caterers, the music...
Be-because I didn't want him to think I was stupid! I mean, that was really embarrassing what happened to you!
No you guys, I am not getting in a car with him, you'll have to think of something else.
I am so proud of Joey, I can't believe he's going to be on Law & Order!
Ohh... I mean two best friends falling in love, how often does that happen?
Of course you did Ross, you would date a gorilla if it called you Indiana Jones!
But you said that you liked him! I mean what happened?! Did ya just change your mind?!
No? Y'know, I can tie one of these into a knot using just my tongue.
Daddy, I just... I can't marry him! I'm sorry. I just don't love him. Well, it matters to me!
Uh-huh, I get it, smoke, chimney, chimney sweep, very funny, ha-ha.
Ross, this is not how we wanted you to find out about this. You have every right to go nuts.
Ok, great, because I gotta get out of here, the smell of beets is killing me!
Well, I met Danny's sister yesterday, and uh that was actually the girl on the subway.
Yeah no, I mean it was at a flea market, so it was y'know, it was like a dollar.
Chandler, you have just described virtually every man that we have ever gone out with.
So you're gonna be in the car, I will be upstairs, and that's where everybody's gonna be!
Okay, first of all, that's stupid and second of all, I'm not allowed to talk to Ralph.
Yeah, and if doesn't work, then we'll be just one of those couples that never have sex.
Uh well, y'know what? I don't think if I feel comfortable stealing on my very first day...
Oh, it's so easy for you I mean, you're not married, you get to have sex with who ever you want!
: So basically, you get your ya-yas by taking money from all of your friends.
Oh, yeah, I'm sorry. They used to live here; sometimes they migrate back over.
What do you get? Emily!! Emil-Whoa!! Okay! So that's me as a cheerleader! Ta-dum!
Well, let's see. The first one is: I don't want to. And, you know, I'm not going.
Ugh, Ross! That was not a near death experience! That was barely an experience!
You know, Ross, just keep making your jokes. How are you gonna feel if we actually do win?
Yeah-No wait! Joey no wait it is. It's something. It's-it's umm...it's my boss.
Oh, no problem. You can borrow it, by the way. Here are your keys, hon.
Okay, that's gonna take them a minute. Do you have anything else you wanna get off your chest?
You need that, you need that too 'cause obviously, a thief could just tear this up.
Oh!... Oh and Emma, look at your stuffed animals lined up so neatly!
Well, last time I almost got fired. You must end it, you must end it now!
Hello? Yeah, this is she. Oh! You're kidding! You're kidding! Oh thank you! I love you!
All right, believe me.If you win the lottery, it's the last you're gonna hear from us!
Yeah, and y'know what? I love them both, so why don't you just pick one and that'll be it.
Ross, c'mon, please. Can we just get out of here, before somebody else gets hurt?
Is my hook unhooked? These things keep falling down, I can't. . .
Y'know what? I cannot do this with my left hand! Would you please, help me with this too?
Well, then, I guess that's the difference between us. See, I'd never make a list.
I know. I know. Oh God. There's no tissue! Can you grab me some toilet paper?
I'm just gonna go in my office and pick up some stuff . Who the hell are you!?
I mean, I'll fly back and forth, they'll fly you out... Anything we want.
Ooh! Y'know what? If we made reservations, we could have unagi in about a half-hour.
Ooooh, that's fine. We'll see who has the last laugh there, monkey boy.
Oh! Did you hear that?! My dad's proud of me! My dad's proud of me.
I love him. He's so pretty I wanna cry! I don't know what to do. Tell me what to do.
No. I just need to be by myself for a while, you know? I just got to figure out what I want
Yeah but how do I start? I mean, what's-what's the first thing that I say? Okay great! Thanks.
What? Monica, they are cute, they are doctors, cute doctors, doctors who are cute!
Hey... hi, ladies... uh, can I get you anything? : Did you bring the mail?
I think, if it was a little colder in here I could see your nipples through that sweater.
Oh no! No! It's actually-it's very sweet. It's very sweet. Look! Yeah, do you want it?
I know you did. I'm just gonna deal with it, I'm just gonna deal with it. I gotta get out of here.
Oh yeah. Well, at least I wasn't too chicken to tell some guy I thought he was cute.
Late thirties? Oh come on you guys! Is it just me? Am I overreacting to this?
Well it's only different if he wants it to be. I mean, I'm not gonna ask him for anything.
Alright thanks, oh Ross could you stop by the coffee house and get me a muffin?
Honey, come on! You live far away! You're not related. You lift right out.
I did it! Oh! I finished it! I did it all by myself! And there's nobody to hug!
Oh, you're not gonna tell the whole story about how your parents got divorced again are you?
Come on Ross! You said you wanted to talk about it, let's talk about it!! How was she?
Look-look-look-look-look, my first pay check! Look at the window, there's my name! Hi, me!
Well, when we first met, you know, I thought you were pompous and arrogant and obnoxious ...
No, you know what, it's late, everything's gonna be closed. Why don't we just do it another night?
All right Paul, I'm not asking for a lot here. Okay? Just give me something. Anything!
Oh yeah! Hopefully across the street if certain Dutch people would just let go.
No, but they stuck me in personal shopping. Which is just a huge step down!
Ross is on a date with my sister and they shut the drapes two and a-half-hours ago.
Yeah that's great. But first, wait, talk to me, talk to me. Tell me about your day.
Well, uh, I-I don't know. See when-when you put it that way y'know it does sort of...
Oh yeah. There is a plan! Why don't I just start taking my smart pills now?
For Stella! Remember? She's gettin' her grove back in like 20 minutes.
Oh, hi! I would check your hand but... I'm sure you don't want to get my chicken disease!
I loved the moment when you first saw the giant dog shadow all over the park.
Okay. Uh, well can we, can we get you anything Mr. Zelner? Maybe some chocolates?
Well, someone that has his own tux, or has the ability to rent a tux.
Uh, I'm just, I'm just looking out your window. At-at the view. What are you guys doing?
Why? Is he? He is! Isn't he? He's dating that slut in marketing!
Well, I assume I'll have to take showers with him, but y'know, that's true of any job.
You're supposed to realize that they are adults! And that they can make their own decisions.
Because it's Richard's son! It's like inviting Greek tragedy over for dinner!
Yeah, sure. Umm, they didn't have poppy seed bagels, so I... Oh my word!
Oh, I have to go pee. Apparently this baby thinks that my bladder is a squeeze toy.
: Really? : Sure, we have scones left! : OK, read them to me.
Yeah! I'm a big fan! Of the movies, you know. Motion pictures. The Talkies!
Hey Pheebs, I'm-I'm taking Charlie shopping, why don't you come and I'll help you find something.
Oh, great! Well, then I'm gonna take Emma to see him. I wonder why Ross said that he died.
Yeah, so what is she, like a... like a spokesmodel, or an aerobics instructor, what?
Monica! I couldn't find him for two hours! He was having sex with Amy Welch!
Well, how can you be a tour guide, don't you have to be a dinosaur expert or something?
Thank you. Now are you sure? Because once I make a copy, there's no turning back.
Oh my God, Phoebe, Pottery Barn has ripped off the design of our antique!
Okay, y'know what? Maybe, this is not about seizing stuff. Maybe this is about escaping stuff.
Ok, so Phoebe, now are you gonna call your dad and let him know that his dog is ok?
This was such a huge mistake. I can't tell him Phoebe. I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't...
I didn't uh, really have time to read this part of the books, but do you think we have time to...
No, not really. You're pressing the baby into my bladder and now I have to pee. Sorry.
I don't know, I'd leave it on the changing table? What?! What'd I do? What'd I do?!
Ok, everybody, let's give a uh nice warm Central Perk welcome to--
Oh, Monica made me send her to my mother's. Apparently babies and weddings don't mix.
Ross, tonight was about the two of you getting along. Oh, would you just see my chiropractor, already.
Airport, airport. Ross, not alone, Julie, arm around her. Cramp, cramp.
Oh no, you guys, just stay here, I'm gonna go check her diaper, Pheebs you wanna come?
Yeah, but umm... Yes, but, Fonzie was already cool, so he wasn't hurt, right?
Or maybe you would see me looking embarrassed because you are talking on the phone with your crotch!
Yeah, but she also invited you and Ross. Yeah, honey, I'm sorry, but I don't think that was a romantic thing.
What, so you go over there, you tell him you think he's cute, what's the worst that could happen?
I got the tickets! I got the tickets! Five hours from now, shoop, shoop, shoop.
What are you talking about?! Mindy, the guy is the devil! He's Satan in a smock!
Oh so you know that, you guys talked about that, so you get along, so you think you're gonna go out?
All right. Let's say I had slept with Mark. Would you have been able to forgive me?
Well is it fair that all you did was put on a cape and I gotta give you free stuff?
Oh God, ohh, okay, y'know what, do you think ah, do you think that you just forget that I told you this?
Well, so then what are you doing to me? Okay? Just get out of here! All right? Move on!
No! Wait! No, no. Don't do that! That's going to make them think they can come over here.
Oh please, he'll be with his real family, the twins and little miss new boobs.
Oh not-not so much. Umm, what-what do you, what do you mean is there something wrong with Ross?
You guys, there's a little girl in Soho looking for this cat. I mean, you know what that means?!
Well, he makes t-shirts for a living, and he thought it would be appropriate to give me this.
Well, actually, I meant for me. The hiring committee is meeting people all day and...
Ross said my name up there, I mean, come on, I just can't pretend that didn't happen can I?
There, well, see? Barry wouldn't even kiss me on a miniature golf course.
Chandler, this is not addressed to you. This is addressed to Mrs. Braverman downstairs. Thief.
Hit me. Hit me. Hit me. Hit me. Hit me. Hit me. Hit me.
Ohh, I'm gonna have to get over it. God, see I didn't know that's I had to do, I just have to get over it.
Okay, Pheebs, can I ask? So, hes going out with her. I mean, is it really so terrible?
Nooo! Nooooo! You lent me Monica's earrings?! I'm not allowed to borrow her stuff!
So you know, I...I handed in that marketing report and I never got to hear what you thought.
Yeah, it is. Yeah, you know, it's tough. Single mom, career... You gotta get out there.
Well, I-I know you can do that too. I'm just, I'm just saying if you need somebody to talk to... Hi!
Well, maybe that's my decision. Well, maybe I don't need your money. Wait!! Wait, I said maybe!!
Here, kitty-kitty. Here kitty-kitty. Where did you go, little kitty-kitty-kitty? Here kitty-kitty-kitty-kitty...
Well, he's coming from Jersey, he said he would get here as fast as he could!
Well, let's see. There was a really big guy that I was talking to, with the really nice breasts...
Hey! Hey! Hi! Hey-hey-hey, I'm Rachel! From upstairs? The ones with all the pizza?
I did!! I watched! I watched! I watched Monica bang his head against that thing!
Everything's ruined. My bed. My clothes. Look at my favorite blue sweater.
Oh, hi. I have a massage appointment under Rachel Green, and here is my gift certificate.
Oh, my, God, c'mon, you guys! He's gonna be home any minute! He's gonna kill me!
Ok, Paulo, why don't you just go get dressed, and then you be on your way, ok, bye-bye.
Oh Gunther! You brought candy! Thank you so much for picking this up! You are so sweet.
Ok, Ross, what's going on here, are we just bringing strange women back to the apartment now?
Okay, wow, wow, wow. Watch the tongue people, we've got a baby over here.
Are you kidding? I'm trained for nothing! I was laughed out of twelve interviews today.
You want me to just call him up and tell him that you're seeing him instead? That's what you want?
Ooh, Phoebe's here! Okay, let's turn out all the lights and we'll just watch the movie!
Ok, Pheebs, you know what, if we had that, we wouldn't be doing the ritual in the first place.
So Joey I just hooked Ross and Chandler up with some tuxedos for the wedding, do you need one?
Oh no, I know I couldn't see it either at first, but it's right umm... Ross, I lost it again.
Oh, I just remembered. We do have something to eat. Monica put something in our oven this morning.
Hmm, mild discomfort. So I take it you've had one of these Braxton thingies?
Whoa! Y'know what Katie? I gotta tell ya I-I-I-I think you are the one who is too much.
I'm serious, I really, I think I need just to have some...meaningless, sex y'know, with the next guy that I see.
No. Yeah, and I know that. All right, well thank you so much for coming in it was nice to meet you.
Well, I never thought I'd say this, but I'm gonna go use Ugly Naked Guy's bathroom.
Maybe it's not as bad as I think. Y'know, maybe they didn't take it the way I meant it.
All right, all right, all right. Last night, I had a dream that, uh, you and I, were...
I just can't believe this! I mean, with the holidays coming up- I wanted him to meet my family-
Oh, come on! Saran Wrap on the toilet seat, you don't think that's just a little funny?!
Honey, honey, I'm sorry, I know it's our anniversary but I told you on the phone I don't have time to stop.
Oh God, come on you guys, is this really necessary? I mean, I can stop charging anytime I want.
Ugh!!! Well, the apartment is already subletted! I mean, this is just hopeless. I'm never gonna find anything.
Wow! I can't believe they didn't put it in the part where you said you didn't watch soap operas.
Can you not look at me when I say this? I thought that if I could get you here, I could seduce you.
Y'guys ever heard the story about when Rosses mom went to the beauty salon?
Okay, okay. Umm, well ah, maybe he, maybe he feels awkward because you are my boss.
Eight weeks. I mean I love my mother, but my God, a long lunch with her is taxing.
Oh, The Velveteen Rabbit! Oh my God, when the boy's love makes the rabbit real!
Oh it does, it does! It is a room separating apparatus from Colonial times.
Should I be concerned that a button fell off the old Hugsy and I can't find it?
Nooo Way! The most romantic song ever is The Way We Were.
Thanks! I've been here about six years, and Rachel moved in a few months ago.
Ross, um, don't forget to get a shot of Emma's cake. It's in a box in the fridge.
Oh, alright. The weirdest place would have to be... ... oh, the foot of the bed.
Okay. Wow! So I get to see what Joey Tribbiani is like on a date. So do you have any moves?
Okay! No accountants. Oh, and no one from like legal. I don't like guys with boring jobs.
All right, well, if you must know... I had a traumatic... swing incident... when I was little.
Well, not myself, but I know other people that have. Ok, you caught me. I'm a laundry virgin.
Alright, now I really have to go. Okay. Au revoir! Oh, they're gonna really hate me over there.
You know, when two people have a connection, you know, that's... just seems like such a... waste.
Oh, really, really good. But enough about me, come on! Where-where are you from? What do you do?
No! No, of course not. No. That's why I brought it up. They didn't have any sodas?
I'm sorry, as I was saying the store number is wrong, and I'm sorry but that's... Oh my God!!
No, wait. No there's gotta be something else that you can do. I mean, what skills do you have?
Okay. Well that's pretty much all that we have-Oh! Oh! Have you ever had a virgin margarita?
I can't let him go out that way, he's got a meeting. You've got something here on your back.
Oh no! I took one of Ross' bags by mistake, and one of mine is missing.
Hi! Sorry- sorry we're late, we, uh, kinda just, y'know, lost track of time.
I'm not paying for half of that! I'm only staying here until my apartment gets fixed.
Right. Was it the, "Please don't show me another picture of a trilobite vibe?"
Well actually thanks, but I think I'm just gonna hang out here tonight. It's been kinda a long day.
Oh, I know, I'm sorry you guys. You're just gonna have to get used to the fact that I will not be dating Ross.
No honey, okay, okay, you wanna know why Ross canceled the date? Because I asked him to.
Come on, I don't really want to be doing this right now. I am carrying a very heavy couch.
Ok, while you "mmm" on it for awhile, I'm gonna go find a place for my new lamp.
I don't know! I mean, maybe that's something to do with the fact that I saw him do a love scene yesterday.
Phoebe, come on, I don't wanna waste it! It would be like throwing away a hundred bucks!
Well I was gonna tell him that I'm-I'm gonna have the baby and he can be as involved as he wants.
Yeah! I don't think you're going to need it though. Okay, check this out. If it's a girl, Rain.
Yeah! That's Phoebe. That's Phoebe. You know, she just wants them all! It's like she's a nympho!
Hah! I found it! I told you I would find it! In your face! You're a different person.
Yeah, my mom got my dad's season tickets in the divorce, so she just gave them to me.
You have not worn that T-shirt since you were 15!! It doesn't even fit you anymore!
Awe! Oh my God! Looks, she's a little dare-devil! Oh, let me push, can I push?
No, no, that's not what we ordered... We ordered a fat-free crust with extra cheese.
Yeah you like totally let him wash his feet in the pool of your inner power.
Yeah I don't think dressing provocatively is going to help me here! Oh my god just please take her.
Okay, now what was that all about? Is it-does it not taste good? Let me try it.
Except that! Oh, hello, Mr. Zelner. We're all ready for our presentation this afternoon.
I just saw Danny getting on the subway with a girl and he had his arm around her.
Oh, c'mon. We'll have, we'll have a big party, and no-one'll know who's with who.
No, come on, I'm totally ok. I don't need you to come! I can totally handle this on my own.
I know, I lied! I didn't want her to think I was a terrible mother! I can't even see my own baby!
One more time from the top... I like big butts and I cannot lie, you other br...
Okay, well keep in mind that by the time you're done, they'll probably be serving dinner.
Ross, what are you talking about? oh! Oh my God! They put my baby's face on a penis!
Oh totally, totally. Y'know it's not that big of deal, we already kinda did it once y'know.
Really?! The Plaza?!! Oh daddy!! Right. Daddy, I need to talk to you. Please, sit down.
No! You guys can't leave yet! You have to stay, we-we got the whole big thing planned!
Julie! Julie, isn't that great? I mean, isn't that just kick- you-in-the-crotch, spit-on-your-neck fantastic?
Okay. Okay fine, y'know what? We will let Ross and Joey decide. Hiiiii, Ross! Sweetie.
Ugh! No more crying! Please! I just dumped one cry baby, I'll dump you too!
Honey, you're not gonna make enough money to help Frank and Alice just by selling knives.
Sure, you know what? Come on, we'll just tell them that there was like a problem with like the "engine".
That is great. Hey, y'know who doesn't have to job hunt? Ross. He works at the university.
You think I trust you with it?! No! We're gonna split it! You take half and I take half!
Well, I do, but you're just gonna have to actually look at this as more of an investment than a cat.
Ok, look you guys, I really don't want to get into this right now. I think it'll just make everyone uncomfortable.
Are you kidding? Eight hours with my mother talking about Atkins? Good luck, Emma!
Yeah, Joey honey, I don't know if this'll mean anything to you but you'll always be pre-approved with us.
But y'know, I never really had anything to worry about. Ross was never very good at the flirting thing.
Well, wait a minute, you're the boss! Why don't you just yell at them? Or, fire them?
...and then they came back from smoking and they had made all of the decisions without me!
All right, y'know what? I-I'm sorry. I will try to tone it down and uh stop yelling.
Well, y'know what though you guys? I really appreciate that but I think I'm just gonna take Sebastian to the charity.
Well y'know what they say, the 23rd time's the charm. Aww, look at you all handsome!
I don't understand! Last time you went out with her you said she was a 'big, dull dud.'
Uh well, I guess I'm not gonna miss the fact that you're never allowed to move the phone pen.
OK, so that's... that's what, two bottles? And yet somehow we went through five?
Oh, Phoebe, are you still on hold? I was supposed to call my Dad back like two hours ago.
Ohh, here you are. I was looking for you before. Joshua's gone so you and Emily are free to go.
Oh god look at her sleeping. Oh, I love her so much! Oh, I think I'm gonna wake her up.
Oh, god, this is great! The plane is gone, so it looks like I'm stuck here with you guys.
Oh god. You've totally messed with the back support of my chair. How do you fix this?
Wha... My resume? I wouldn't... I wouldn't call my online dating profile a resume.
Yeah. So don't move, okay? Just stay here and... maybe close your blinds at night.
Well I assume the ah, happy couple isn't up yet. Did you guys hear them last night?
Well, we're not here to meet guys. You have a boyfriend, I have a b. . . baby and a Ross.
Ugh! Get out! Get out! Go! Come on! No! Not in there! He's in there!
Well maybe he saw your hand slip briefly from the ten and two o'clock position.
Wherever I go. Come on you and me, we'll-we'll start a new group, we're the best ones.
Aww. Well, ok, well that's very nice. And you wrote a card . "From Gavin"
Oh, yeah, ok. Let me just grab my night vision goggles and my stun gun.
In the future, when a girl asks for some ill-advised sympathy sex... just do it.
Wha... forget it Ross, no, I am not gonna stand here and make a list of. . .
Yeah, I know, go long. Y'know, it's like all I'm doing is running back and forth from the huddle.
Uhh, let's just stay clear of 'I'm the guy that's doing you daughter' and you should be ok.
Guys, you're not gonna believe this! I was just saying goodnight to Emma and she said her first words!!
Im okay! Im okay! Mr. Heckles, Mr. Heckles could you help me please?
Oh! See just I'm right back where I started! Aww, this sucks! Being alone, sucks!
Hey, I was doin' great before I found out about you. You think it's easy for me to see you with Julie?
Wow, Ikea... what a rich culture. Uhm, you know what? I have a friend who is a masseuse.
Oh, no, no no. I meant that he's gonna be paying that other woman beause she's a professional.
I think I just shipped 3,000 bras to personnel. Oh honey, I gotta go. Mark, I need you!
Hey, so he stole a couple bucks from me! At least he bought me something with it!
Oh my God! I'm standing at a cash register, holding a credit card, and I'm bored.
I dunno. Y'know to me he'll always be "Jack Geller, walks in while you're changing."
Yeah, I feel kinda bad for them, but I'm also really psyched 'cause I don't have to move in here!
Thank you. Hey-hey umm, uh, is there, is there any such thing as an annulment shower?
Oh, okay. Uhh, well let's see. You're about-well uh, this one is large. And this one-
No! They didn't even talk to each other. God, how was I supposed to know they were having problems?
Mon, if uh you were at lunch alone, how come it cost you uh 53 dollars?
Yes-yes, just a few seconds and she'd still be with us-nothing about an assistant buyer?
Oh Emma. This is going to be your first Thanksgiving. What are you thankful for? Mommy's bobbies.
Well I'm alone and I just bought fifteen dollars worth of candy bars, what do you think?
What? What? He's interested in you. He-he likes your hair, he just wants to know how you got here.
Oh, no-no-no, no-no-no, it has become, it has-yeah. Oh no, those were four great dates.
And your horoscope says, "On the fifth a special someone is going to give you a gift."
Honey, you have nothing to prove. And if you really like this girl, I don't flirting is the right thing to...
Yes, I'm sorry. Do you have any extra pants? Umm, my friend seems to have had a little accident.
Yeah, I'll be fine. But could someone please make sure that sandwich is gone when I get out there?
That's your whole name, okay of course it is! Okay, well let's-let's just have a look-see here.
Oh, well thank you for taking your tongue out of my sister's mouth long enough to tell me that.
Yeah. Just, if it's possible, could you leave him somewhere and go have sex with another guy?
Oh, you're not gonna believe what happened to me today! Ralph Lauren called, and gave me my job back!
There's been a teeny-teeny change in plans. It turns out that I'm not free tonight. So...
I, I didn't say any... I sw... I did not say anything, I swear. He stopped by.
OK, sorry to break up this party, but I've got resumes to fax before work tomorrow...
Uh, I will see you... and I'll raise you. What do you say... want to waste another buck?
Oh, Joey, it's so great to be back here. I gotta tell you, you're making it so easy on me and Emma.
Uh, no. Wait, you know what, this is the outfit that makes my calves look fat. Nevermind.
Ross, I have been walking around like this since the plane! I can-you have so crossed a line.
Yeah.. yeah right.. Remember in high school when I died and didn't give you my baby?
Hi! Just so you know, we-we didn't mean to fog you, we thought you were like a yeti or something.
Wh... So... If neither of you are married by the time you're 40, you're gonna marry Joey.
Joey, I gotta tell ya, I've been thinking all day about that scene you did, I mean, you were amazing!
That's right, I wanna do it with you! I've been trying to fight it, but you just said all the right things.
Well, it wasn't just me, alright? He freaked out too! He couldn't even undo my bra!
Oh yeah, scared the hell out of me. I thought we'd lost you forever. Pheebs, you lie down?
Well, if you see him, will you please tell him that I'm looking for him and that this I am not gonna throw up!
Well, people missed you in there. And in fact, there was actually a request for "Smelly Cat".
Well, he didn't say, but it was a fire. I'm guessing not very good. Come on, we gotta go!
Joey, Emma's right here! You promised not to bring girls home in the middle of the day anymore.
I'm so glad, I'm so glad you shared. And I'm glad that you're done. What do you say we umm...
Forgot my purse! Oh, you guys made up. He's a good kisser isn't he? I'm going!
Let me just get this straight! So I go have a baby and they send some guy in to do my job?
Okay you're right. I'll hire Hilda tomorrow. Dumb old perfect for the job Hilda!
Sweety, I gotta tell ya... it sounds a little bit like you like the apartment more than you like...
No Paul, I don't know anything about you! Y'know, like-like your childhood! Tell me about your childhood!
Oh no, no-no-no, that's not, not, not, what he is doing. He's just, he's just really romantic.
Okay. Umm, well, first I would like to start by apologizing for kissing you and uh, for yelling at you.
Yeah, if you're going to do the ears, you might as well take a pass at the nosal area.
Oh, really, well Ross, you know what? I am a big girl. I don't need someone telling me what is best for me.
Yeah, yeah. Phoebe and I are going to have so much fun. And thank you for watching the baby, by the way.
Do you think it's possible for two friends to fool around and... and not have it be a big deal?
I am not a baby! You know what? I swear to god, just because you get so uptight every time we...
Ok Ross, just so you know, calling it a poopie diaper doesn't make this process any cuter.
Yeah! You and that girl from that copy place, which yesterday you took full responsibility for!!
Well, that shouldn't be a problem. I mean I work in fashion and all I meet are eligible straight men.
Y'know what Tag, if we went down to the office you would see those contracts sitting on your desk.
Oh Joey, I'm so happy things worked out for us that we're having this baby together. I love you so much.
Oh, y'know, it's just like hats, and a shirt, and CD's, just sort of stuff that you've left here.
He didn't turn me down! He's at the game isn't he? I got the date, I'm just not on it!
I know, so do I. Oh Phoebe, I'm so glad you made me do this. OK, lemme se yours.
It kinda worked. I mean y'know, I don't know about you buy I haven't thought about our thing since all this.
Ok, ok, that's fine. Fine. Hey, I'm sorry about that spill before. Only $98.50 to go.
No. Ross: Hey Rach, have you seen Charlie anywhere? Ross: I'm smarter than him!
And remember how you always said you were afraid the landlord would find out and then tear it down?
I can't believe that you yelled at my boss! I'm-I'm gonna lose my job! What am I going to do?!
God, I hope he doesn't show up. Of course he's not gonna show up, the guy hates me.
Oh honey, I'm sorry we can't help you there, 'cause we're cuddlily sleepers. Okay, I'm late for work.
Yeah Melissa, I don't want to be known as the uh, office bitch, but I will call your supervisor.
Great!! It was very, very nice to meet you sir--Ow! Hey! What are you doing?! Are you crazy!
No it's okay, this is what's gonna happen. I'm gonna wait a couple years and then the baby will tell him.
I am feeling nothing. Speaking of hot, watching you do that really makes me want to have sex with you.
Right! But, none of that compared to how kind and-and how gentle and thoughtful he is.
Thanks. God this is so stupid! How could I be upset over something I never had? It's negative?
Uh-uh-uh, right now? Because I've kinda got an el fresco situation going on over here.
"Well, should we just continue to live together and not really tell each other how we're really feeling?"
Okay. Oh, uh, wait a minute, y'know what? I uh, I can't decide this. Umm, okay, just hold on a second.
Oh wait! Y'know what? I can't, I can't look at it. I can't. Somebody else tell me, somebody tell me.
Oh honey, are you jealous of Paolo? Oh, c'mon, I'm so much happier with you than I ever was with him.
No? All right, here's the truth um, Joey said what he said, because um, I'm attracted to you.
I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love- and that'd be it? ..Ross?
Hey, can I borrow the key to your house so I can run across the street and make a copy?
"Pheebs, can't make it, got a date. Talk to you later. Big Daddy." Big Daddy?
Joey, just because they're not getting married doesn't mean this is going to be a disaster. Maybe they have a plan!
I'm just saying that y'know, someday Ross is gonna meet somebody and...he's gonna have his own life. Right?
so basically you've slept with all the woman in New York and now you're just going around again.
Is the window open? Because if there's a window open, a bird could fly in there.
Phoebe, if this guy's going through a divorce, is it such a good idea to start going out with him?
Ohh, OK, OK, OK, well, basically, lately, I've uh, I've uh, sort of had feelings for you.
Monica? You gonna be very proud of me. I just got us dates with two unbelievably cute nurses.
So I was with Joshua for an hour today, and he has not asked me out. It's just so frustrating!
Oh my God! Oh my God! Thank you! That was the fire department, there was a fire at our place!
Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. Maybe it's not so bad. How did you leave it?
Ah, hah-hah-hah-ho, yeah, he wishes. Oh, I'm sorry, look at me. OK, Michael, let's talk about you.
Hi! I got you some coffee. To, uh... ...fair enough. So! Do you got anything for me?
Why not? I don't want to do this alone! And he's such a sweet guy and he loves me so much.
That cute waiter guy from your restaurant, the one that looks like a non-threatening Ray Liotta?
Ross, it is 100 degrees outside. For the first time in weeks, I am somewhat comfortable.
I did the first time! Oh. Oh.. And you know what. You want to know why I'm not giving Emily to you.
Yeah but-but-but you liked me! Oh my God, I can't believe this, all this time, I liked you and you liked me!
Really! God Ross, what were you thinking? I know it's really shallow, but a part of me wants him again.
Oh, it's a tattoo! That's weird, Phoebe doesn't... Wait that's Ursula! That's not Phoebe that is Ursula!
You know what? I don't want to be with them either, but it's Thanksgiving and we should not want to be together, together.
Oh sorry didn't mean to interrupt. It's just such a beautiful space; do you do a lot of weddings here?
All right, let's get this party started, huh? Joey and Phoebe are gonna perform a little something for us.
Emmm. Now, instead of the vegetables, is there anyway I can substitute the three-pound lobster?
Oh, I know. Hey, y'know what we never did? Oh no, not that. We uh, we never had bonus night!
I'm sorry, what did you just say? Did you just say hi? Oh my God, Ross, Ross, Ben just said 'Hi'.
Oh hey you. Thanks for coming out of me. I know. Oh. Yeah. Oh, she's looking at me. Hi! I know you.
Mon, honey you're not dying. I'm just moving out. Y'know, I mean we're gonna see each other all the time.
Oh my God! Listen to you talkin' about having kids. Oh my Joey. Oh, please don't get married before I do.
well, now, wait a second, who did I just put as my "In case of emergency" person?
So why don't you just let me worry about making the trifle and you just worry about eating it, alright?
Hey... Hi you guys! Listen, you know what? I'm not feeling really well. I think I can't get out for the play.
So Ross, we went out for two years, and you never told me you were in an I Hate Rachel club.
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry, but I need to get off the plane, okay? I need to tell someone that I love love them.
Well, she-she ob-obviously saw the tire tracks that were leading up to the closed garage.
I don't know... maybe it's because she has got such callousy fingers from playing crummy guitar...
Hmm. Do you think-Could you tell me if she's hanging in, in a one bedroom or a two?
I mean I'm probably 98% happy, maybe 2% jealous. And I mean what's 2%? That's nothing.
Phoebe the father is not here okay? I haven't told him yet and I don't think I can tell him at all now!
Are you serious?! Chandler, we ate an entire cheesecake two days ago and you want more?
Yeah, I did, but y'know what? I am really, really trying to cut back, y'know? Good luck, Rach.
Yeah, sure Mr. Zelner, for you anything-minute. Okay. Fine. Abort the plan, abort the plan.
See, Gavin, you're capable of being a nice guy. Why did you give me such a hard time?
No! I do not care what my hormones are doing, I am not going to just do it with some random guy!
So would I. You wouldn't think that Annie Liebawitz would forget to put film in the camera.
Oh my God! You guys this is so great! I mean it's so unexpected! I mean Chandler's birthday is even before mine!
Ok. So now, I think Emma is probably down for the night, but if you need anything Ross . . .
Oh, all right. But y'know I gotta say, I don't, I don't think six years counts as an era.
No, I didn't. I wouldn't say I had the keys unless I had the keys, and I obviously didn't have the keys.
Okay, hi. Ladies and gentlemen, back by popular demand, Miss Phoebe Buffay. Wooh!
Oh uh-uh pal! Don't call me mommy! It's bad enough you call your own mother that.
You know what? We should call my mum's house and say goodnight to Emma before she goes down.
Zelner! Right! I knew that! I really, really want this job and I think, I think I would be really good at it.
God, I am so glad you don't have a problem with this, because if you did, I wouldn't even consider applying.
I meant er, young, young, I meant young, young to be a doctor. Oh good, Rach.
So it seemed that my prom date had stood me up, so Ross selflessly, offered to take me.
Um look I was thinking.. If its ok with Monica I would like to invite Amy to Thanksgiving.
Mira, Mira, el viejo desnudo est haciendo el hula hoop!
'Cos I was gonna say there's no way you could've done the end the way you guys did it back then!
Yes! Yes! Yes, I do! I do know! Frank and Alice are gonna want to keep all of their children!
I know, I know, and you were right Ross. You are soo irresponsible I am never letting you baby-sit ever again!
Well can we see it?! Oh maybe we shouldn't. I mean if she just died this morning out of respect.
OH! And the year before that, when you set up that nighttime tour of that button factory?
Ew, was Chandler naked? Sort of like a, like a ring toss kind of situation?
No...Yeah, all the time, constantly. It's terrifying. But you know that I figure it...it has to work out.
Oh no-no, no-no, they don't want you to put your hands in the pockets until you are out of the store.
See, there's always one guy. "If I had a wish, I'd wish for three more wishes."
Oh! Right! Yeah! Hold on, I'll be just clean up in here a little bit! Hello Gavin.
Why don't you just marry her? Oh no, wait a minute you can't, I'm sorry I forgot, she's not a lesbian.
I'd love that. I would loooove... So uh, so where is sweet little Ben? I would love to have a little...
Oh no wait Pheebs, I think for something like that you just ask them to move in with you. But I'm not sure, Chandler?
Oh, okay see I thought, I thought you meant how much was it when it was new, y'know like back then.
Oh God. Ross, OK, if you care about me at all, you will get the pie out of the man's hood.
How... wha... Hey! What are you... What is this? Have you guys been listening this entire time?
Ok, Well, what about these are white cotton panties. Would they go with whites or delicates?
Well, I-I-I don't know how this fits into your whole "seizing" thing but um, Emily called you today.
Uh Will umm, I just want to say that I'm real sorry for whatever I-I did to you in high school...
OH MY GOD!!! Sorry, I was just imagining what it'd be like to catch the money bouquet.
Oooh... you're sweet, I knew uncle Joey would step up. Look Emma, look who's baaack!
Phoebe, you were right. I should've never gone to London, and from now on you make all of my decisions for me.
Oh well, it's kinda lonely up there, so I just thought I would come out here and get some fresh air.
You know we were all alone and he was being really nice to me and, oh and he gave me this scarf...
Oh god what am I gonna do you guys, I can't even comfort my own baby! I'm the worst mother ever!
Oh God, oh. Great, Monica, y'know what, you could've called, I have been up here, I've been worried...
No, that was his costume. See, he's actually an orthodontist, but he came as a regular dentist.
Oh hey! Hey Ross! Hey how's it, how's it going with you and Mona? Are you guys still together?
Look, I cannot do this right now, okay, I've got a deadline, would you just go home, I'll talk to you later.
Look, I know what's going on here, okay, Mark explained it all to me. He said this is what you guys do.
I'm pregnant. Ross? Ross? Okay, whenever you're ready. And you're the father by the way-but you got that...
I love how he cares so much about stuff. If I squint I can pretend he's Alan Alda.
No, not even close. Forget Vail, forget seeing my family, forget shoop, shoop, shoop.
Well-well that's 'cause I went down there and they were all smoking. This is actually the smell of success.
Oh not bad. Do you know that feeling when you're trying to blow a Saint Bernard out your ass?
Ok, Ross, try to hear me. Ok, I, hey, I'm not gonna lie to you. Ok, it was good with Paolo.
Ross, you guys went out once. You took your kids to Chucky Cheese, and you didn't even kiss her.
I just finished getting Phoebe all dressed to meet Mike's parents. She's so nervous, it's so sweet!
Patrick and I had such a great time last night! I mean I think this could maybe turn into something serious.
Okay... Hey listen, just before you go I-I again, I just wanna say "thank you" for coming with me.
Definitely! Phoebe, you will not find a single game show host, who's ass I cannot kick.
Well isn't it better that I exchanged it for something that I enjoy and that I can get a lot of use out of?
Whoa! My God! So what, you all just joined together to hate me?! Who else was in this club?
Closure, that's what it is. Closure. Hello, excuse me. Excuse me, hel. . . woo
Oh thanks, but listen, I was just at Monica's and she and Chandler had a big fight and they're not moving in.
Oh, let me see! Oh, God, is he just the sweetest thing? You must just want to kiss him all over!
Wow! Oh, she's so nice and big! Oh, Monica, where are you going to display Gladys oh so proudly?
She's totally right! When we were together, you got all freaked out about Mark and there was nothing going on.
Okay. All right, I see what he's doing! He's not asking me out, because he wants me to ask him out.
Phoebe, I think... It's just too weird, I just saw a one year old running around with pantyhose on!
Yes, Joey, I remember, she's annoying, but you know what she's-she's his girlfriend now. I mean what can we do?
Oh my God! Oh my God!! That is like the third most prestigious soap opera award there is!
Hello? Yes, she is, hold on a second, please. Monana, it's for you, the credit card people.
Are you joking? Check out is not 'til noon and he has a good eleven minutes left.
Oh yeah, really? Is it Ross? Yeah? Okay, well let me make this a just a little bit easier for you.
Oh. Oh yeah, don't get to worked up over it. I mean it-it sounds like he's a doctor, but he's not.
Yeah, but then you spent Phoebe's entire birthday party talking to my breasts, so then I figured maybe not.
No. Ross, it, it just seems that y'know it's time we-we y'know, move on. I mean, I mean don't' you think?
No! Ross, no! It is not fine! Eh-eh-according to my plan I should already be with the guy I wanna marry!
Yeah honey, I'm standing right there! Why didn't you just tell him about the mole I haven't got checked yet.
Uhh, because I'm trying to play hard to get. Oh, quick he's looking over here, say something funny.
Come on, this isn't funny. She thinks it's my fault that you haven't called her. You have to call her!
Yeah, well, it's a Mercedes if I move back home. Oh, it was horrible. He called me young lady.
So wh..? He's smart, he's qualified. Give me one good reason we shouldn't try him out.
It wouldn't have mattered anyway, Phoebe, you and I are, are gonna live together, we're roommates; that's the deal.
Well, alright, then, forget it. Might as well just go home. Ow ow ow ow!
Yeah but, maybe it's not what we think. Maybe it's tell Monica I'm sorry I...drank the last of the milk.
They're my new 'I don't need a job, I don't need my parents, I've got great boots' boots!
No, there's a party. There's a party. But the power, that is still up for grabs. You follow me?
Umm, okay, I think I'm-I'm just gonna-just gonna say it. Just gonna say it. Uhh, I'm still in love with you Ross.
OK... ah, it's light... ...it rattles... it's... Travel Scrabble! Oooohhh, thank you!
You guys, you're never gonna believe what I just found tacked up on a telephone pole! Look kinda familiar?
Yeah! I've been sailing my whole life. When I was fifteen my dad bought me my own boat.
Ross, things aren't gonna be weird between us, right? I mean was that just the stupidest thing, me telling you that?
I wouldn't worry about it. She's always coming up with stuff like this, and you know what? She's almost never right.
Oh, yeah, sure, sure, sure, sure. Listen, can we please have lunch the next time I'm in the city?
yeah your both so slutty you don't even remember who you've slept with, you're made for each other.
That's great. So now, Super Gavin, when I come back where are you planning on flying off to?
Yeah, what're you saying, you just sort of put away feelings or whatever the hell it was you felt for me?
OH! What's it the anniversary of? Your first date, your first kiss, first time you had sex...
You would be too if you found John and David boots on sale, fifty percent off!
Yeah Pheebs, honey, she just got engaged a couple of hours ago. I doubt she's even had time to...
Oh my God Phoebe! I mean I'm just-Wait a minute. If I'm your maid of honor that means you are Monica's.
Ok, fine! You can make fun of me. I do not want Emma going there. And I was thinking Claire Danes.
No! Joey, oh you're so sweet. You're so-so sweet, honey. But I'm not, I'm not looking for a husband.
Okay. Oh wait! One more thing umm, do-do we still need to uh settle the question of "us?"
Oh God! Alright, fine. You know what Joey, forget it. When we go back to New York, I will tell him.
Okay, look, Ross, I realise that my Father is difficult, but that's why you have got to be the bigger man here.
Well, here's another question for ya. Uhh, do you know what that silver knob on the toilet does?
Ross, that was a Halloween costume, unless you would like me to go to this thing as Little Bo Peep.
And remember how I said I was going to keep it in my purse so that if it rang I could just pick it up?
Oh sure Ross, yeah. If I have a heart attack in a restaurant, I want you there with your fossil brush.
GIVE ME THE BOOK! Pablo Diaz, Brady Smith, huh, "Guy-in-van"?
Irrational, huh? All right, well, I'll remember that the next time you freak out about a spider in your apartment!
He got all weird and sputtery and then he said uh, "Yeah, I hear those hemorrhoids are a bitch."
Okay, you go do it! I'll come back to that set! I'll meet more actors! I'll meet 'em all!
I don't wanna stand in the way of true love or anything, but I think a cantaloupe might hurt less.
No honey, it's okay! Listen, I'll got to Ross's and get the blender, you get all the margarita stuff ready.
Oh no no no no no, Gavin can't, he already has plans, most likely with his mother.
Ohh Tag, umm...you're such a great guy and we have sooo much fun together but I don't-I don't...
What, no, no, no, mine are deceptively small I mean, I-I-I actually sometimes, st-stuff my bra.
Oh, okay, well, I think we should let Phoebe decide, because she's the only who's impartial, and she's so pretty.
Ugh! Look honey y'know what? I haven't told him yet, so until I do I don't think I should tell anybody else.
Yeah and honey I promise next time that I will just say good-bye and tell 'em you're not looking for a relationship.
I have an extra ticket. An extra ticket. Not, two tickets, I have an extra ticket.
Okay. Great! So now that you guys all know you can help me. Give me some advice on how I'm gonna tell Ross!
Okay, remember uh, remember how you told me that your grandmother put up that wall to make that into two bedrooms?
I'm not! We're having a girl! Sometimes I can't believe it's with you-But still! We're having a girl!
Oh my God, wait did I-I just said Greens don't quit didn't I? Did I just say Greens don't quit?!
So-so, you missed a message from who? Chandler or your mom? Or Chandler? Or your mom?
Well, y'know, the reason I didn't wanna go running with you is because um, well y'know the way that you run is a little...
Well maybe she and her friends are just having a contest to see who can bring home the biggest geek.
Oh God. You know what? Who you think you are? Who are you to decide what messages I should or should not get?
Careful. Light. Okay, do you know how, just sweep it across the lid. Okay? Just sweep it.
Then, we had this big, stupid fight, and I said I wanted to take a break, I don't want to take a break.
Yeah, well, it's an important day. I wanna look nice. Um, has uh Dr. Franzblau been by?
Oh well, well thank you. Okay, stop. Stop looking at me like that. The last time that happened, that happened.
Oh, well, I guess I had that one coming. I'm just gonna throw it out, it's probably just a bunch of shampoo and...
OK, here we go. Honey, I'm sorry, they were all out of apple pie, someone just got the last piece.
Remember?! We-come on both had the sarongs on, and we had the-the coconut bikini tops...
When she sees that you're gone, she's gonna know that I let you out, and that I was in here, and I'm gonna get fired!
Okay. God y'know, if someone told me a week ago that I would be peeing in Joey Tribbiani's apartment...
Yeah, it's kinda like a 'good luck on your first day' sort of thing. Is this actually a lunchbox?
Oh please. Okay, anyone in this room think that I would send Ross begging symbols, please show of hands.
I mean y'know, I'm thinking. You could bring her, and you guys could go up to your old room, and not make out.
And hey! Just so you know, it's not that common! It doesn't happen to every guy! And it is a big deal!!
You'd be okay if you knew that Mark had kissed me, and been naked with me, and made love to me?
Oh my God....What's he gonna do now? I can't watch! Oh. Seriously, how can you watch this? Aren't you scared?
No, I also had to go to a couple houses with him as his girlfriend. Oh, I am just awful with children!
Okay Phoebe calm down, there's no need to place blame. Okay? I warned her about those candles.
Right. So, what you have to do is, you have to accidentally run into her on purpose. And then act aloof.
Look, this is not that big of a deal! You just don't date Ross! There's a million other guys out there, you just...
Oh God, Ross. Ross is going to pick up the phone. Oh, I have to get my number back. Oh my God. He's gone.
Wait, we still have time to talk and they're-they're not even in the car yet! Oh look, there they go, okay.
Okay, but if it only happened that one time, how come we found your underwear in our apartment the other day?
Come on Ross give me the keys! Monica does not know what she's talking about! I am an excellent driver!
Of course I packed! Monica relax! I just wanted to ask Phoebe her opinion on what I should wear tonight.
Honey, this is not your fault, just because you guys had a fight, it does not justify her sleeping with someone.
But see, it was a plan. Y'know, it was clear. It was figured out, and now everything's just kinda like...
Y'know, I-I gotta tell ya, those eye drops are a miracle. My eye is a 100% better.
Monica, number one, I don't think Ben understands the concept of bribery, and number two, I... What?!
Ok, I'm sorry, I'm just not very good with babies. I mean I haven't been around them, I mean, you know, since I was one.
Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight with you Ross! Look, urrgh, maybe we should take a break.
Ugh, the worse day! Y'know, you think you're making progress at work and then your boss calls you Raquel.
Sup.. You want to talk supportive? You didn't even come and visit me when I was in the hospital having the baby.
I-I know-I had put them in...in-in my desk at work and I completely forgot about them until today.
All right, you know what, that's fine. If you guys want to be children about this, that's fine. I do not need to see it.
Oh God, I can't believe you're making such a big deal about this. It was one kiss, one guy, one time!
I uh, I have two tickets to the Knicks game tonight if you're interested, just as a thank you for this week.
Y'know what? Fine, I don't care. Don't believe me, I know I'm right-do you guys want to go downstairs and get a drink?
I did but she doesn't think anyone would be stupid enough to confuse Kenny the copy guy with Ralph Lauren.
Wait, wait, Chandler, this is what you're havin' for Thanksgiving dinner? What, what, what is it with you and this holiday?
Hey! Hey, Pheebs, check it out. Yeah, for my desert, I have chosen to make a traditional English truffle!
Well not when they find out you slept with Jason Hurley an hour after he broke up with Monica.
I know. You know, we're just gonna have to figure out a plan tonight. Can you please just take care of her for today?
Well, we were walking down the street and we saw that van that you guys used for catering and we realised...
Oh, wait Joey! We fought the Nazis in World War II, not World War I.
And Chandler, you're gonna have to watch those long showers you take in the morning because you know Raquel can't be late.
Look, you guys... this is really, really important to me. And it means a lot if you could try to get on board.
Yes, yes it is true. And I know this because, because he pretended to be Drake to, to sleep with me.
I know. I know. I panicked, I panicked. I didn't want him to start yelling at me like I was some '74 Latour.
Phoebe, his music could not get any worse. There are rats in the basement that are hanging themselves.
Oh Joey, I'm sorry I just couldn't tell her all those things you wanted me to tell her. And y'know we got to talking and I...
I didn't have to, because I was wearing my 'I heart Ross' sandwich board and ringing my bell.
Oh! Y'know what? You're right! We meet, you flirted and then bamn nine years later you had me!
Monica, your dad just beeped in, but can you make it quick? Talking to Rome. I'm talking to Rome.
So what are you saying; I should run him under hot water and bang his head against a table?
Okay. 'Cause this is where I wanna be, okay? No more messing around. I don't wanna mess this up again.
Yeah I know it's really boring, but it's like a big deal. Anyway, I was thinking about renting Cujo sometime.
You know honey, there is a thin line between love and hate, and it turns out that line...is a scarf!
No-no! Big bear! Big bear outside! I think I-I-would you-actually, would you go check on that?
But don't you think Rosita would've wanted you to move on? I mean y'know, she did always put...your comfort first.
Oh! I see. And I've sort of been maintaining my amateur status so that I can waitress in the Olympics.
Ohh! Phoebe, this is all your fault! Now he loves her, he's gonna marry her, and this is all your fault.
No. No, because I know exactly how the conversation's gonna go. "Hey Ross, you know, I think we had a moment before."
Hey-hey-hey that's funny! Your funny Chandler! Your a funny guy! You wanna know what else is really funny?!
Oh, by the way Mon, I don't think the mailman liked your cookies. Here are the ornaments your mom sent.
Oh wow, eight hours? So you could probably really use one of those plug-in telephone headsets huh?
Alright, I don't wanna alarm anybody, but Monica's hair is twice as big as it was when we landed!
Yeah, just so weird seeing him like that, you know? I mean he is a doctor, you don't expect doctors to get sick!
I know, it's amazing. It's amazing. It's so much better than what I had at Ralph Lauren. The money is great...
Ohhhh. Honey, honey, honey, it's okay, it's okay honey. I'm gonna fix you a drink, huh? Maybe a margarita?
Oh Ross you're so tense! You just gotta relax okay? Just need to relax all right? Just need to relax...
Hi, I'm sorry I'm late but I am ready, ready to talk you up! When does Liz's father get here?
Please. If she said to you, "Ross, I want you on this couch, right here, right now," what would you say?
Excuse me, I wanted you to help, but you couldn't move your arms because you were wearing three life jackets.
Oh. Listen, I'm so sorry. I would, I would've never fogged you if y'know if you hadn't looked so.... Y'know.
That's crazy! You can't do that! What are you going to tell her? Oh God. Ohh, you already agreed to this, haven't you?
Because it took us months to find a good nanny and I wouldn't want anything to, you know, drive her away.
Monica, this is Dan , one of the guys that we're gonna be going out with on Saturday. Uh Dan, Monica.
Monica, would you calm down? The credit card people said that you only have to pay for the stuff that you bought.
They're not!! Ross, they're just saving them for the important people!! Okay?! What-what if I was the president?!
What? Ross and Charlie? Wow! She's really making her way through the group, huh? Ah, who am I to talk?
Hey! Oh Joey, honey listen, thank you for talking to my yesterday about that thing with my boss. That really meant a lot.
Well, at first it was really intense, you know. And then, oh, god, and then we just sort of sunk into it.
When?! After the birth of our first secret child?! Ross didn't get the annulment; we are still married.
Cats, how long do they live figuring you don't... y'know, throw 'em under a bus or something?
Ross! Come on! That's all right! Fine--Okay, I have a weird thing about my eye. Can we not talk about it please?
Honey, it's so sweet that you want me to stay, but I-I can't do that to you. I mean it would disrupt your entire life.
You don't tell a guy that you're looking for a serious relationship! You don't tell the guy that! Now you scared him away!
She was just crawling around and she found him, so I just let her sleep with him. That's all right? Isn't it?
Oh come on Ross, we've done it before we'll do it again, it'll be a nice way to bookend the pregnancy.
All right, you know what? This isn't funny anymore. There's something about me on that piece of paper and I want to see it.
Yeah. And y'know who should've shut their drapes? Is that perverted old couple two doors over.
And that was so sweet of you to ask! Oh my God, the three of us are gonna have such a good time living together!
Oh! Hi you guys, oh my God! You'll never gonna believe happened to me today! I am sitting in my office and...
Oh, did you beat him at a board game? He turns into such a baby when he starts to lose.
Oh, please, Monica. You've always hated my lamp, and then, all of a sudden, it's just magically broken?
Agh, what a jerk. I kept talking about you and he kept asking me out. I mean, naturally, you know, I said no.
Oh no! Yes! Of course, I know that! I just-I meant y'know are you still a 'We' or are you just 'You?'
All right, I took them. But I figured it would be okay because you got a big ink stain on the crotch.
Yes! And I know what looks sexy on guys. Please, just wear what I suggest, and she's gonna go nuts for you.
Hi. Hey, hi! So uh, Frank and Alice wanted me to tell you that they're still outside making phone calls.
Well, I just lost a job, and I'd like to raise the bet five bucks. Does anybody have a problem with that?
Oh, you're one of those. But y'know what? I have two sisters of my own and we just-just tortured each other.
I know, but I was just thinking about how huge this is for me. I didn't even go to how huge this was going to be for the father.
Absolutely! Absolutely. I d... it's just a little weird, it's you, and it's me, it's just gonna take some getting used to.
Okay, okay, okay, look, just don't freak out, but I kinda lost it. I know it's in the apartment, but I definitely lost it.
Jill this is not about me being jealous of you! This is about you being a brat! Wanting what you can't have!
That is right and traditionally the daddy is supposed to give the mummy a present but I am prepared to let that go.
I don't know, I mean, this is just my initial gut feeling... but I'm thinking... oh, I'm thinking it'd be really great.
Honey, y'know I just gotta tell you, I think this is such a terrific thing you're having these babies for Frank and Alice.
Okay. Ah, well we'll just see about that, okay. I will read The Shining, and you will read Little Women.
Yes, yes, it does. Okay, look, the restaurant called, they wanna know if you're gonna be showing up for work?
Oh, hon can you grab me my other box of tissues? They're right on that chair under Ross's coat.
Yeah, I do. I think you should go, by yourself, get some distance, clear your head, I think it'd be really good.
Not stupid. The very cute, cute, cute doctors asked us out for tomorrow night, and I said "yes."
Wow! This is shaping up to be a pretty good date-Oh, I almost forgot. I didn't pay you the rent check.
Yeah-but come on-Listen, I'm sorry I don't want to make you uncomfortable, but I told Phoebe that it happened and she doesn't believe me.
Nooo! Phoebe, of course there is more! I mean, I'll just go and talk to Monica and get an ETA on the pee-pee's!
What? Oh, well then y'know what? I think Monica would be very interested to know that you called her cheesecake dry and mealy.
Ross, you know what? She may need one..We're just going to have to make our peace with that! Monica and Chandler's apartment.
Why you guys this isn't funny, all right? If I wanted this cake to be a disaster I would have baked it myself!
Oh no, yes I do! I do! I mean, come on go on, you were, you were saying I am happier when uh, y'know?
Oh please, I hate packing, it's closer to work, and we do have fun. Although, I'm really gonna miss living with you.
Alright. Well then how about I call your supervisor, and I tell her that you shot my friend in the ass with a dart?
Nooo! Hello? Oh, yeah, no, I know, I-I haven't been using it much. Oh, well, thanks, but, I'm okay, really.
Ok, ok, ok. I promise, I promise, I promise, I won't do it again. I really do. I promise. This is gonna be great.
This is such a great party! 35 years. Very impressive, do you guys have any pearls of wisdom?
Fifty-two minutes. So no-no brothers and sisters, huh? That must be nice. You don't have to share stuff.
I'm not vanilla! I've done lots of crazy things! I mean I got-I got drunk and married in Vegas!
Ok, well this is like that...in no way. I had a...I had a dream last night that I wanted to kiss Joey.
Not working with me, Joe! Here's the thing: lately I have been having thoughts musings, if you will!
Wow! This explains so much! Last weekend, I went from store to store sitting on Santa's lap.
Yeah! Oh, umm when-when Monica and Chandler got engaged I started putting some stuff together, y'know just in case...
Gone! I mean its amazing Pheebs. I feel so free and so graceful. Hey! Look out for the horse! Sorry!
Okay. Okay. All right, you take care of that. And meanwhile, the party is tomorrow and we still don't have a guest list.
Oh no-no-no don't say but! No-no, but's never good! Let's just leave it at, you like me and I like you.
No! No! Phoebe, come on! I don't want to switch! Please come on! I can throw wet paper towels here!
And umm, vintage handkerchiefs y'know 'cause, people cry at weddings. I'm just gonna grab a couple of these.
We've got to find a new pediatrician. Ross was getting sick last night, and I think Emma may have caught it.
Yeah, yeah and you know what, I know she's gonna wanna run again, I just don't know how to get out of it, I mean, I live with her.
Terry is a jerk, ok? That's why we're always saying "Terry's a jerk!" That's where that came from.
Don't worry, we're just gonna search here for an hour, them we're gonna go over to Joey's and search, OK?
No, forget it! No way! I am not sending anymore Ralph Lauren clothes to prison. It is a waste.
Okay now Joey, y'know that since you're returning all of this stuff right after the audition you're gonna have to wear underwear?
That-that is your make out buddy. Don't you recognize him? Oh wait. Ohh, Phoebe I love you. Kiss me please.
Okay..Okay.. Look. I'm sorry that I lied to you before. You were right. Ralph and I were an item but were not anymore.
Wh, Ross what do you want from me? You want me, you want me to quit my job so you can feel like you have a girlfriend?
C'mon, I'm not saying it was a bad movie, I'm just saying, you know, it was a little. . . hard to follow.
Ow ow ow. Ow ow ow ow. Ow ow ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow.
Oh well then, so I'm just going to go back to talking to my friend here. And you can go back to enjoying your little hamburger.
The logic is, that there are two of us and we are both strong enough to break a chair in half!
Ohh, whoa God! Storage rooms give me the creeps! Monica, come on please hurry up honey! Please?
Ohh. Oh, so you really wanted to learn. Yeah, y'know, Pheebs I just wanted to have fun. Ohh, you know who you should go with?
I don't know Tag! How can your genitals make phone calls? Okay? It's not a perfect world! Just go please.
No! Joey please! Please don't! Please don't leave like this! Now come on, you cannot do this to a pregnant woman!
We should defiantly play football more often. Maybe there's a like league we could join or something.
Oh, Monica, you think Skippy liked you? Honey, all those buys had a bet to see if he can knock you over.
Huh. Well, then you'd better keep it away from Ross's hair. So this is pretty rare. How did you get that?
Yeah! Closure. That's what it is, that's what I need. God, you're brilliant! Why didn't I think of that? How do I get that?
Oh oh oh, wait! You only got whipped cream in there! Ya gotta take a bite with all the layers!
Hey! Y'know what? You are in our apartment all the time! Okay? This is, this is just a drop in the bucket mister!
You're going to have a baby, and you need to be prepared. Now, you're going to make yourself watch the whole thing. Just do it!
Okay, okay, okay, I got one! Anyway- The valentine Tommy Rollerson left in your locker was really from me.
Don't worry, we're just gonna search here for an hour, and then we're gonna go over to Joey's and search, OK?
Oh, come on! He's glad that I came, he doesn't want me to go anywhere, balls flying all over the place!
Hi, Pheebs? Okay, so just spoke to the nurse and the reason that your doctor is late is because uh, she's not coming.
Chandler! Patrick just uh, ended things with me. Did you or did you not tell him that I was looking for a serious relationship?
Oh, hey, I have an idea. Why don't we play rock-paper-scissors, and whoever loses goes in first. Ready? .
Well, there is one thing that we haven't tried, but someone thinks that, "That will open up a can of worms."
Oh, right. Sorry. But Tag's not coming; his girlfriend came into town, so he's spending Thanksgiving with her.
Okay, uh, you let me go grocery shopping, and I buy laundry detergent, but it's not the one with the easy-pour spout.
Honey, I don't know how to tell you this, but um, if something were to happen to Ross or to myself um you wouldn't get the baby.
No, no, trust, me, it's, it's, it's much better that I know. Uh, I just liked it better before it was better...
Oh! You know, I just... couple of things I tried ... I just sang a little doo... Itsy Bitsy Spider...
Oh yeah! But you know what? If you need Hugsy, don't worry. Emma will totally understand. I won't... but whatever .
Joey look, just look at it this way, the sooner Phoebe breaks Chandler the sooner this is all over and out in the open.
No, I know, but Ihe just went on. He's right there, he's got the blue jacket on, I... can I j-just...
Wait, but there's no money! Well this is terrible! You guys are gonna have to get married in like a, rec. center!
Do you guys ever get the feeling that um, Chandler and those guys just don't get that we don't make as much money as they do?
Puzzler. A bit of a puzzle. Why don't you um, check the copy room, maybe you left the contracts in there?
man sharks. I always knew there was something weird about that dude. But you promised to love him no matter what.
Ha! See, I knew, I knew you'd get it on the first guess. Isn't it cool! It's an apothecary table.
Yeah, oh my God, tomorrow! That, no, it's perfect. Oh God, thank you soo much. Great! Bye! I got the interview!
Then we took a walk down to Bendall's, and I told him not to, but he got me a little bottle of Chanel...
Someone? I brought people. Mr. Thompson, this is Phoebe. Phoebe, this is Mr. Thompson. He's the head of my department.
All this stuff takes up a lot of room. Hey how uh, how serious are you about keeping Ben in your life?
Well, it would be easier to move just right across the hall. Wait a minute, unless you're thinking about Naked Wednesday's.
She was kinda stupid. You're right. All right, I'm just gonna go on the date. I'm gonna go on the date. That is the new plan.
All right look lady here is the deal, I came here for an annulment and I am not leaving here until I get one!
Oh! Believe you me! I am going to bring this cake back, I don't even want it in my home... Joey, don't touch it!!
I have it, I have it, I have it. Oh, okay, I can't find it, but I remember that I was in seat 32C, because that's my bra-size.
Good! 'Cause I've got a product report to read, it's like eight pages, I hope I don't fall asleep.
Gavin, I just wanted to say thank you again for watching Emma yesterday during the presentation. I really owe you an appology.
Y'know when I locked myself in the bathroom at my wedding, it was because I was trying to pop the window out of the frame.
Horny bitch. No! You're a horny bitch! Noooo! You're the horny bitch! No! You're a horny bitch!
I know, I know. And oh, and this time Chip promised that-that this time it will last at least for an entire song!
Ugh. Excuse me, could you give this to that guy over there? Go ahead. Thank you. Sorry. Okay, Las Vegas.
Ok, that's true. That's true, we can do this. You're right, you're right, we can do this. We're just gonna power through!
I'm not jealous. All right this is about, umm, people feeling certain things y'know about strippers. And y'know, and um, I...
Oh that's so cute: Ross and Mike's first date. Is that going to be awkward? I mean, what are you guys going to talk about?
I know. But if some guy who looks like Corey Haim wants to kiss me tonight, I'm sooo gonna let them!
Hey, Mon, if you were hoping to sleep with Joshua the first time tonight, which one of these would you want to be wearing.
See? Why, Gavin, why? Right when I'm about to change my opinion of you, you go and you ... and you do that ...
Oh please, theyve been going out a week. They havent even slept together yet, I mean, thats not serious.
All right, y'know what? If you don't want to believe me about this, why don't you just come with me to dinner tonight and she will tell you.
Pheebs, I... there isn't gonna be any flying about! We actually thought we were a little too mature for stuff like that.
But Joey, I don't think Ross wants me to move into his apartment and disrupt his life like that. I mean--Or he does.
I can't believe this. All I wanted to do was help you try to figure out what to do with your life and this is how you repay me?
Yeah, you know what we should all do? We should play that game where everyone says one thing that they're thankful for.
Yeah, I love that story. Um, I got a question for you guys. Why do people keep is saying that is good to see me up and about?
Oh, no! No you guys! Come on, you don't have to do that! I'm happy for him! I am! I really-I'm-I'm happ-I'll work on it.
Hello? Um, yeah, uh, Okay ah, hold on a second, lemme lemme just check and see if see if she's here.
Umm, okay. But while you dial, let me show you the features of my new ringing handbag. Oh, it does work!
Phoebe, come on! What is the big deal? I thought this was going to be something we could do together! Y'know, I thought it would be fun!
When a guy breaks up with his girlfriend, what is an appropriate amount of time to wait before you make a move?
Yeah-yeah, did-didn't you use to have a pair? They were really round, burgundy, and they made you look kind of umm...
No, I just mean that, you know, first impressions don't mean anything. And I-I think you're a really good guy and I'm sorry that I misjudged you.
Look Amy, it got a little of control..Um.. and I'm sorry. You're my sister and uh.. if it really means that much to you..
Ross-Ross, you have no idea what this means to me! I mean, I mean I was gonna be homeless. You just saved me! You're my hero!
Ross I'm so sorry. Okay. I-I will promise I will straighten this out with him tomorrow in person, or via e-mail.
Okay, hold on just a second. I'm sorry, it's for human resources, everybody has to do it. Could you just stand up please?
Oh, I have to pee. If I don't come out in five minutes it's because I've choked to death on the potpourri stink.
Well y'know what? I hope Monica forgives you after you throw her, her vegetarian, voodoo, goddess circley shower!
Ooh, I just wish we hadn't lost those four months, but if time was what you needed just to gain a little perspective...
Dear losers, do you really think I'd hide presents under the couch? P.S. Chandler, I knew they'd break you.
Oh whose side are you on? I'm not giving you Emma because there is no way you could handle the responibility of a child.
Okay, y'know what, y'know what? This playing hard to get thing is not working. Umm, hand-hand me those cherries. Okay. Okay. Hi!
Ross! We broke up two years ago; you've been married since then. I think it's okay that we see other people.
Well, y'know what? Thanks to you I'm half way there! Ugh! Oh! I am so mad! Ross, I don't think I have ever been this angry!
Phoebe, just the idea of pitting one baby against another, I mean, you know, and judging who's cuter just for a trophy...
Whoa-whoa, there's two living rooms? God, growing up here, this place must've been a real babe magnet.
I can not believe I have to walk down the aisle in front of 200 people looking like something you drink when your nauseous.
Well, because if one more person says "what a cute little boy" I'm gonna whip them with a car antenna!
Everybody? Shh, shhh. Uhhh... Central Perk is proud to present the music of Miss Phoebe Buffay.
Yeah, I can't live with Joey once the baby comes. I don't want my child's first words to be, "How you doin'?"
OK, alright, OK, um... then could you please, uh... just give him a message for me? Please? This is very important.
Pheebs, this guy has been obsessed with your sister, for God knows how long, okay, you don't just give up something like that.
No, we decided that I would go ahead and set up first, and then my mom would bring Emma to Paris on Sunday.
Okay, listen, I'm thinking, why don't we just tell them who we really are? I mean, it'll be fine, I really think it'll be fine.
It's the woman from the hospital admissions office. She says there's a problem with the form. Oh, god, oh god...
Excuse me, can I, can I bum one of those? Y'know what, actually... Okay, okay, okay, what's so funny over here?
Why? Who's not having. . . Are you and Julie not, are, are you and, are you and Julie not having sex?
No! Phoebe just because I'm alone doesn't mean I wanna walk around naked. I mean, you live alone, you don't walk around naked.
No I know, because to be a grandmother you have to be married and have children and I don't have any of those things. That's why it's so funny.
Well, it was, and you would have seen it if you didn't showed up at ... 9:30?? God! Oh, this party was lame ...
No. No no no no no. That's Rodney McDowell. Andie McDowell is the guy from Planet of the Apes.
Oh come on Ross, why are we wasting our time with this other stuff?! We know what's gonna work! It's doctor recommended!
Okay, honey, what he means by that, is ...while this is a very nice gift, maybe it's just not something a boyfriend gives?
Daddy, daddy, you know what, I really wanna hear more about this, I really do, but I just have, I just have to do a, some stuff.
Ok well, well I'm really, I'm sorry about that Joey, but do you think that maybe on some level, you don't want to take off my bra?
Oh, I've got big Valentine's plans! I've got my Chinese food on the way, and the rest of your saltwater taffy!
I wanna sleep, I wanna eat, I wanna take a shower, I mean before she wakes up and we gotta do this all over again.
Oh you missed it. She was laughing. Oh it was amazing. It was amazing. It was the most beautiful, beautiful sound that...
Oh, good, good! We had this idea to make a birthday video for Emma and we'll give it to her when she is 18.
Oh my God! I was so afraid I wasn't gonna remember any of my high-school French, but I understood every word you just said!
No no no no no. You wanted me to take them down, so... ..Im takin em down. Okay? Whoa!
Nodded off!! Ross you were snoring. My father's boat didn't make that much noise when it hit rocks!
Thirty. Ugh, I mean thirty! Monica, do you remember mean, old Mrs. Kreeger in the fifth grade? She was thirty!
Pete the Weeper? Remember that guy who used to cry every time we had sex. "Was it good for you?"
No, it's just that uhm... it feels so good... Ikea... Yeah, say hey, you'll know this, what's the capital of Sweden?
Because I'm married. That's right, I am a married woman! And I came to a TV star's apartment to have an affair! Uck!
No-no, that wasn't me! Well, we should get started. Let me show you my underwear. The selection of underwear we carry.
Me? I'm great! I'm fine! I'm sooo good!! But, you know who's not great?! Men! You're a man right Ross?!
Don't worry I promise that you will only have to be pregnant for a few more hours, 'cause I'm going to tell the father today.
What? Maybe I put it in here . Oh, oh, it's not in there! Oh, no! I must have packed it in one of these boxes!
All right, look, we did not know that you wanted a stripper so we went to the phonebook and we got the first name we could find!
Hey you guys... You're never gonna believe it. This headhunter called me. I have a meeting tomorrow with Gucci. Gucci wants me.
So we're okay, we're okay, we're okay, aren't we? No, we're not okay, we're not okay, there's a bump, there's a bump.
It was like this crazy-eyed, hairy beast man! He was like a, like a bigfoot or a yeti or something!
Oh, between you telling him that I wanted to have a fling and me putting out on the first date-oh, he's so gonna get the wrong idea.
Ugh, is she pregnant yet? She doesn't need to be; she'll still have the baby before I do. Oh Ross, another contraction!
Alright, come on... Alright, you guys. We're so sorry we're late. Please let us in, so we can have dinner together.
I don't know, his uh, his hair never really bothered me that much, and y'know it was always more crunchy than it was greasy.
Okay. All right. Honey listen. When I tell you what I'm about to tell you, I need you to remember that we are all here for you and that we love you.
A vacation? My idea of a vacation does not involve something sucking on my nipples until they are raw.
No, honey, they're not, but don't worry, because we are going to find them, and until we do, we are all here for you, ok?
Yes! Yes! I got half a mind to contract that doctor's uterus though. Mild discomfort, what's he talking about?
Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, this is so stupid! I mean, I gave Barry up, right? I should be happy for them! I am, I'm happy for them.
All right, will you, will you at least tell him how hollow and unsatisfying this, dating tons of women thing is!
...So a bird just grabbed it, and then tried to fly away with it and, and then just dropped it on the street?
Hey. Oh, I have a question. If-if-if one of you had to pick one of the other two guys to go out with, who would you pick?
No! No! Seriously, what's wrong with the dog?! Wait a minute, what are you doing home so early? What happened to your date?
I screwed up so bad, I told Monica that I would stuff and send all these wedding invitations like weeks ago and I-I...
That's right, he can have his job back. I'm glad we got that all straightened out. There you go, Joey, you got your job back.
Phoebe, what the hell are you talking about? Other than their names being similar, I'm sorry, I do not see what you're seeing.
Oh right, 'cause you always pull your pants down at the count of three and play Wipe-out on your butt cheeks.
Okay, but Pheebs, Pheebs, Jack gave up a cow, I gave up an orthodontist. Okay, I-I-I know, I know I didn't love him-
I dunno.. I-I thought it looked better there. And I- and also, it's an extra seat around the coffee table.
Wait a minute! You let Ross drive the Porsche and when I ask you, you say you're the only one who's allowed to drive it.
And there's a peach cobbler warming in the oven so the plate's gonna be hot but that shouldn't be a problem for you.
Oh that's five Ross. Five women have had five babies! And I have had no babies! Why doesn't she want to come out?
Love to love ya baby! Ow! Love to love ya baby! Ow! Love to love ya, baby! Darnit! Ugh.
So from that you think you've got me all figured out? Well, you don't! Y'know I-I could have toys for underprivileged kids in here!
"Dear losers, do you really think I'd hide presents under the couch? P.S.: Chandler, I knew they'd break you."
Oh, Joey, come on! Please, please! Let me come, I will behave, I promise! I will behave! Please, please, please...
Oh, I would love some. But y'know what? Y'know what? Let's not drink it here. I'm feeling kinda crazy. You wanna go to Newark?
Nothing! Phoebe kinda made a mistake. But y'know you do wear that sweater a lot, are you involved in some kind of dare?
No, no Phoebe no, I was...no. You know what, I was, I was actually just checking to, see, if I could run. And I can!
Ben y'know when uh, when you were a baby, you and I used to hang out all the time. 'Cause I was, I was your daddy's girlfriend.
Oh, uh, Joanna I was wondering if I could ask you something. There's an opening for an assistant buyer in Junior Miss...
So, I'm in my apartment doing the Soap Opera Digest crossword puzzle, and guess who the clue is for three down.
And you know which one we should see? The 1996 Tony award winner. Do you happen to know the name of that one?
Oh, Ross, relax. It's probably like two dollars for the first contraction, and then fifty cents for each additional contraction.
Honey, come on, I have to be at work in like ten minutes Oh, all right, well it's not like I'm employee of the year or anything.
The earring? No. But look, I found my sunglasses under the couch! I've been looking for these since like last summer.
Well, they said would but they would only give me store credit. I mean, what am I going to do, get a thousand regular cats?
I just never had a relationship with that kind of passion, you know, where you have to have somebody right there, in the middle of a theme park.
Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight over and over again, Ross, no, you're, you're, you're making this too hard.
Phoebe and I saw Chandler with a blonde woman today outside on the street and then we followed them to a house in Westchester.
Well, for your information, Paolo is gonna be in Rome this New Year, so I'll be just as pathetic as the rest of you.
...is something I'm very interested in! Oh please, do not tell Ross. He still believes that what's in the inside is important...
Y'know, I know it's totally superficial and we have absolutely nothing in common, and we don't even speak the same language but Goooooooddddddd....
It's just physical and I have it totally under control! Ok? It's just, when I see them together, sometimes I just get a little jealous!
Yeah but, my assistant Tag does sit-ups in the office during lunch. Ohh! I could just spread him on a cracker.
How would you like to sit in a chair that fully reclines, has a rolling massage, and speakers in the head rest?
Yeah! Y'know, ever since I ran out on Barry at the wedding, I have wondered whether I made the right choice. And now I know.
All right, now don't judge me. I normally wait until my date leaves, but you live here. I'm ripping into this swan.
Yeah, seriously coz this is really heavy. I mean not for me because i'm only pretending to hold this, but for these guys.
Aww, Joey, come here. Look honey, I know this must be really, really difficult for you and I--Oh, I'm sorry. Am I hurting you?
Well, that's a lot better than Ross trying to kiss me in High School, and saying that he did it because he needed chapstick.
Okay, y'know, would you feel better if we went someplace else? I mean we could pack all this stuff up and y'know go to your apartment.
Oh God, it says he was hit by an ice cream truck and dragged for nine--teen blocks. Oh. Oh my God.
Hey Mon, let's give Pete a chance Come on, he was funny, he seems really nice, and that check thing was adorable.
I don't know, I mean I would give anything to work for a designer, y'know, or a buyer.... Oh, I just don't want to be 30 and still work here.
No! Ross, come on! No! Listen, look I thought a lot about how to tell you this and the bottom line, Ross, is we can not stay married.
Well, hey! How about right above the TV? . That way, it will be the first thing that you see when you walk in the door!
Oh, please!Honey, just the fact that you want me here to support you, I'm...OH MY GOD!Is that Christian Sanders?He's so gorgeous!
Okay Joey, first of all Kash Ford is not people. Second of all, what did he say when you told him I was pregnant?
Yeah. Well. Hey uh Joe, would mind going over to Chandler's bedroom and get that book back that he borrowed from me?
Ok mom, you know what, fine, I'll make an appointment ok, but you know what, right now, I gotta go, I gotta go do a thing.
She is not Rachem. What the hell's a Rachem? Is that some stupid paleontology word that I wouldn't know because I'm just a waitress.
Well, it'd better not be about the apartment pants, because I just pitched the idea to my boss at Ralph Lauren and she loved it.
Well, let's see... uh... I know that she has a meeting with her lawyer and then she has to make a very big poop. Why?
Well that was depressing, I think I just bought a soft pretzel from one of the kids from Fame. Ready to go to the movies?
Oh... sit down, sit down. Oh, honey, you know, I once also almost married somebody that I didn't love. Do you remember Barry?
Wow, Monica, I love that, you really have faith in me. Thank you. Technical question, how do you know when uh, the butter's done?
Oh they are nice. We-we custom-make tuxedos for celebrities and then when they're done with them they just send 'em back.
Amy, you know what? I was thinking that maybe now it'd be a good time for us to sit down and, you know, talk about your future.
Okay, well this is all very impressive Hilda, um I just have one last question for you. Uh, how did I do? Was this okay?
Well, umm, I guess I read Little Women more than once. But I mean that's a classic, what's so great about The Shining?
Uh-huh. No, I hear what you're saying and-and-and that makes a lot of sense but can I just say one more thing? Look how pretty!
Okay great, hold on a sec! Oh, here you go! You don't mind do ya? That would really help me out a lot! Thanks!
Alright, alright look, just uh... just try to remember how you felt when you were in love, and think about that when you're playing the scene.
Oh, yeah, yeah. Actually, I got the extended disco version, with three choruses of "You'll never make it on your own".
Hi! You guys, the car-service just got here. I can't believe they're not home yet! I have to catch my stupid plane. I wanna see the baby!
Well, I did my best to convince him that I'm not some crazy girl who is dying to get married-I'm just going through a hard time.
Okay, as everybody has ordered, I would like to start the celebration and make a toast ... to Phoebe. She dropped her sock.
When the Louis Vuitton people found out that Ralph Lauren wanted me back, the offered me more money! Isn't that great?
No! I'm sorry, honey, it's just that last week I got all but three answers and I really want to finish a whole one without any help.
Wow! I don't know if I could ever do that. I always figured the first time I had a baby was with somebody I love and that baby would be a...keeper.
Y'know I don't, I don't understand guys, I mean I-I would never congratulate Monica on a great stew by y'know, grabbin' her boob.
Oh Mon, listen I have to ask! Okay, Joey Tribbiani invited me back to his apartment, now does he do this with a lot of girls?
Oh my gosh! Oh wow! Oh, I know what this is! Wait a minute. That can't be right. Is that a beer bong for a baby?
So if you think I didn't say goodbye to you because you don't mean as much to me as everybody else, you're wrong. It's because you mean more to me.
Hi, welcome to our tropical Christmas party. You can put your coats and sweaters and pants and shirts in the bedroom.
Y'know what else is really great about him, oh, what is the word for the adult that doesn't have dinosaur toys in their bedroom?
Well, not at first, but it was very intricate work and they said even though they lost their sight, it was all worth it.
You know what, we just say that she said it was 5 o'clock. We'll just act casual. We're not late, we're right on time.
Yeah I know-I'm good-I got it! Now wait a minute, I've got one more thing I have to say to you...oh right! Shut up!
Well, they never have any paper in there y'know. So my rule is 'no tissue, no tuschy.' Well, if everybody's going.
No! I mean come on! This is a huge deal! Fine I want-I need more details, who-who initiated the first kiss?
Uh, yeah. Uh, Monica, y'know, honey, I've been thinking about it and I've decided thisthis whole Ross thing, it's just not a good idea.
Oh what, my whole insane jealousy thing? Well, y'know, as much fun as that was, I've decided to opt for sanity.
That's-that's great! See? I already feel like I know you a little better! Thank you. Okay, come on. Now we can go eat. Let's go.
You're sister? You're sister's asleep on the couch? Ohhh! I saw her with you on the subway and now she's asleep on the couch!
You are right there with Emily. And it's y'know, it's kinda like.... it's a tie! Well, I gotta get, I gotta get back to the dishes.
No, no, no, no! Ross, wait! Come on! You know, there's other stuff. Here's a nice shirt, look at these nice pants...
Aw, it's unbelievable! Wow! She is kicking so much! Oh, she's like umm...oh...who's that kind of annoying girl soccer player?
I have the best job in the entire world! The most adorable guy came over today, and I got to dress him up all day!
Yeah, I said what was okay when I thought she was some weird bald chick. I mean, y'know, that girl has hair got all over head!
Joey, you're such an amazing actor! How do you know where Dr. Drake Remoray leaves off and Joey Tribbiani begins?
Don't say anything. I don't wanna speak, I don't wanna think. I just want you to take me and kiss me and make love to me right here, right now.
Umm Pheebs, remember when we were in the coffee house we decided that I was going to keep the uh, the cute guy's cell phone?
This one's from Joey... feels like a book. Thinks it's a book... feels like a book. And... ...it's a book!
I'm just bummed about the way I left things with Ross. I shouldn't have lied to him about having to work. He seemed so mad at me.
Ohh, yeah, well I wanted to give Emily a big American good-bye cheer. So okay! Ready! Okay! Gimme an 'E!'
Come on, it's not a big deal! We stayed up all night coming up with a plan so that us dating will not be a problem.
It was ... oh my god. He didn't have a last name. It was just "Tag". You know, like Cher, or, you know, Moses.
Well, oh, Mark, I'm doing this for the wrong reasons, y'know? I'm just doing it to get back at Ross. I'm sorry, it's not very fair to you.
Oh. That's so Monica can keep track. That way if one on them is missing, she can be like, 'Where's number 27?!'
I know, but it's just it's the first time, and I just don't want her to think that because I didn't marry Barry, that my life is total crap, you know?
Hi! Sorry to bother you, but I don't think we can accept your acceptance of our apology, it just doesn't really seem like you mean it.
What? Come on, it's not like I'm asking for this girly clock or anything, which, by the way, I also think is very cool.
Doctor you gotta do something! I think you gotta give me drugs or you gotta light a fire up in there and just smoke it out.
Phoebe, come on can we finish this later? Cause I wanna go running before it gets dark. Oh! Why don't you come with me?!
Ohh, well, isn't that just lovely. That's something the two of you will be able to enjoy for a really, really, really, really, really long time.
Oh yeah, it's fine, it's fine. Sandy was just... was just telling me about how he proposed to his fiance and it was just sooo beautiful.
Oh wow. That-y'know what? That is so unfair. Y'know what? Now I want to steal your thunder! Come on Ross, let's go have sex!
I thought this might happen today. Ross, I know the holidays can be rough. Y'know? And it's probably really hard for you to be alone right now.
Yeah. Your teeth? Yes, I saw them from outside. You guys are never going to believe this. But, Phoebe made out with Ralph Lauren.
I can't believe you don't want to know. I mean, I couldn't not know, I mean, if, if the doctor knows, and Carol knows, and Susan knows....
Oh you're not. You're not gonna get in the middle of anything, don't worry about Ross really, really. Oh! Hide! That's Ross! Hide! Hide!
Oh it was great! It was great! I went down there just like you said, y'know? And we talked business. Kim totally took my opinions.
No, there's nothing to make up, she's gonna know that I have a key to her office, I've got to get you locked up back the way you were!
Okay! Okay-okay look-no I did, I just wanted this stuff and I know how you feel about Pottery Barn. Just... Come on don't be mad.
Well, you're lucky you never met that bitch Sharon Majesky. Anyway, umm... The rest of you life, y'know? Any regrets?
What, what, wait a minute! You haven't even told her you were a doctor, yet? How long have you known her, likean hour?
All right. All right, all right, all right, all right, I know it's stupid! I will go see him this afternoon, and I will just put an end to it!
Ohh, it's gonna be so great! I'm gonna get to help decide what we sell, I'm gonna have an office with walls and everything. I'm gonna have walls!
Ok. You decorate dad's office and so now you're a decorator. Okay! I went to the zoo yesterday and now I'm a koala bear.
Well, I was actually-I-I came over here to-to borrow this lamp. To umm, look at my books, y'know, see them a little better.
Oh my God! Oh my God!! Ohh, Jessica Lockhart!! In my apartment!! I am such a huge fan! I am such a huge fan!
Hey, y'know what? I'm not waiting! I'm gonna push this baby out! I'm doing it! I mean it's what? Three centimeters? That's gotta be like this!
Come on, it's a hypnosis tape. This woman at work used it for two weeks straight and she hasn't smoked since.
Me either. Umm, all right, first thing I need you to do is go downstairs and find a women named Hilda and tell her to go home.
Well, there was a disaster in shipping and I've got to get this order in. Honey, I'm so sorry, but it looks like I'm gonna be here all night.
You WHAT? You sang... to our baby daughter... a song about a guy who likes to have sex with women with giant asses?
Jealous of what? Of your lack of responsiblity? You, your immaturity? Your total disregard of other people's feelings?
Yes, yes. I still want my daughters picture, but on a bunny cake. Yellow cake, chocolate frosting with nuts!
Well, someone was supposed to write "Rach, take down the lights" and put it on the re... frigerate... How long has that been there?
Ooh, is this one of those things where you throw it in a bag with some graveyard dirt and hang it from a north-facing tree?
All right let me see. Uma Thurman, Winona Ryder, Elizabeth Hurely, Michelle Pfieffer, and Dorothy Hammel?
Are you kidding?! With the, with the lilies, and-and the song, and the stars! It was...really wonderful! Did you just make that up?
Chandler, I gotta tell you, I love your mom's books! I love her books! I cannot get on a plane without one! I mean, this is so cool!
Anyway, I'm going to be the coordinator of the woman's collection, I'll work right under the director, it's the perfect, perfect job for me!
And I mean, you know, you guys... This is a big deal. I mean, how can we have her first birthday party without her aunt and her uncle!
Hey, come on! I had this friend from college and I made the stupid mistake of telling Joey that one time...she and I y'know...kissed a little bit.
Okay, come on-Joey, I'll buy you a new one! All right? We'll go down to the store right now and we'll-we'll get you a new chair.
Oh oh no just stopped to throw up a little bit. Oh come on, what am I gonna do, its been hours and it won't stop crying.
Oh no, I know that. I know that. Although, we made a joke that we spend so much time together he should call me his work wife.
No! Downstairs! And we got to talking y'know, for like two hours, and I really liked him so I invited him up here for a cup of coffee.
Okay, very cute braces. Anyway y'know what, the point is Tag, start looking because you are going to find those contracts on your desk.
Well, I was thinking maybe a um, a romantic dinner with um, candles and wine and then uh, maybe going back to my place for um, dessert.
Ross, look, I know that some of this stuff is out there, but I mean, come on, look at this, look at this sweater! . I mean, this is just beautiful!
Hey! Y'know, sometimes you can do everything right, everyone can wear everything they're supposed to wear, and one of those little guys just gets through!
And y'know what, I'm gonna, I'm gonna go to bed now, but ah, on my way to work tomorrow morning, I'm gonna stop by around 8:30.
Woow!I haven't seen you this worked up since you did that dog food commercial and you thought you were gonna be with a real talking dog!
Well, it's a little low... pick up a little... a little bit more... a little bit more... There you go! Now throw it away!
But I couldn't even if I wanted to, because I don't know! I swear; I didn't see anything, and I don't want to know! It was just a momentary lapse.
Ross, I'm telling you, she's giving up getting her eyebrows shaped to do this alright? Do you understand how important that is in our world?
God, the first time he smiled at me... those three seconds were more exciting than three weeks in Bermuda with Barry.
You know what? I've been thinking about it. I'm really coming around on the name Ruth. I think I would actually consider naming our child that.
I am so sick of guys. I don't want to look at another guy, I don't want to think about another guy, I don't even want to be near another guy.
Look Joey, come on she's so perfect for you! I mean she's sweet, she-she likes baseball, and she-she had two beers at lunch.
Well, the point is, maybe I should just stop waiting around for moments with Ross, you know? I should just . . . move on with my life.
Oh no! No! No-no-no-no! No, I mean come on that's-that's crazy-I mean that's crazy. So what's-what's going on with you? What is going on with you?
Y'know what? I've just had it with high school boys! They are just silly. Silly, stupid boys! I'm going to start dating men!
What? Oh y'know what? Can we please keep the chicken and the turkey and everything on the other side of the table? The smell is just yuck!
Oh really? So you're saying they just slid out of your bottom drawer, crawled across the floor, then jumped on to my desk?!
What's with the rain, Geller? I mean, when I signed up for Dino Week, nobody said anything about it being monsoon season.
"Oh my God, I can't find a boyfriend! So I guess I'll just stumble across the hall and sleep with the first guy I find in there!"
Yeah! Guess who walks into my office is the end of my story. It was Ralph Lauren! Ralph Lauren walked into my office!
Okay. So these signals Ross, explain this to me, 'cause maybe I need to be more careful. I mean, am I sending you these signals right now?
Noo! Maybe! I, I don't know. Ross, I still can't forgive you for what you did, I can't, I just, but sometimes when I'm with you I just, I feel so...
Oh my goodness, she had the smoothest skin! I mean when I stuck that dollar bill in her g-string and grazed her thigh...
Well y'know I was just in the neighborhood and I passed by your building and I thought to myself, "What's up with Carol and sweet, little Ben?"
Yeah! You know, ever since I had that dream about him, and can't get it out of my head! And what's the big deal, people do it all the time!
Um, this is gonna sound kinda goofy but uhhm, my friend over there, who cooks by the way, um, she thinks you're cute.
Terrible? Hell, I was in Greece! That was a nice hotel! Nice beach, met the nice people. Not to shabby for Rachel.
I didn't! Even when I found out...umm, all right, well let's just say I found something out something about someone and let's just say she's gonna keep it.
He is, isn't he? I don't know, I don't know, I mean maybe it's just being here at the beach together or, I don't know. But it's like something...
Hi! Hey, listen, can we ask you a question? When you and Monica first hooked up, was it weird going from friends to... more than that?
Hey Ross? Umm, I just ran into Caitlin in the hallway and-and uh, you must be getting better at this flirting stuff than I thought.
Okay, um, I... All right Phoebe look, I just wanted to say that I'm sorry. OK? I handled the situation horribly and I should not have lied to you.
Country club newsletter. My mother sends me the engagement notices for 'inspiration.' Oh my God! Oh my God, it's Barry and Mindy!
Because, I feel like I wouldn't just be going out with him. I would be going out with all of you. Oh, and there would just be all this pressure, and I don't wanna...
I'll tell ya who should be embarrassed! It's you guys! Come on! This is ridiculous! Thank you very much, but I do not need you to get me a date!
Okay, two things didn't happen. Remember I told you that someone made out with Ralph Lauren in the copy room? Well, it turns out that's not true.
Oh! Oh! Oh my God! Ohhh, ohhh, wow, that ear and nose hair trimmer I got him was just money down the drain, huh?
Oops, sorry. Listen, we-we have to have a party tonight! Actually, we have to have one in five minutes, so everybody cancel your plans.
Well, I don't know. I called all the people in Monica's phone book and these are the only ones who could show up on 24 hours notice.
Look you guys, I have to go, I'm the Maid-of-Honor. And besides you know what I just need to be in a room again with these people and feel good about myself.
Uhh, I mean this is like reading about my own life. I mean this book could have been called 'Be Your Own Windkeeper Rachel'.
Oh, well. Everything that I need is in here and my travel documents are on the counter organized in the order that I will be needing them.
But I don't, hmm... Oh, who approved that order?! Well there is no Mark Robbinson in this office. Get me Mark on the phone!
Pheebs, I would make a reservation for five, because one of us has to stay home and watch Emma. Which one of us should go to dinner?
Come on you guys! Listen, if Emily knew I was here having dinner you with you she would flip out and you know it. It's okay, I really... I don't mind.
Joey, the new chair will be here in an hour. Maybe we should actually move Rosita out of here. Y'know, start the heeling process?
Oh-oh-oh, symbolism! And uh, the-the uh, wildness of the mores, which I think is-is mirrored in the wildness of Heathcliff's character.
Yeah. Y'know umm, uh, umm, about that, umm, Ross I really appreciate your offer to let me move in and everything, but don't you think it's gonna be weird?
Since when do take naps in that position. Oh God Monica, tell me you were waiting for a guy! Please tell me you were waiting for a guy!
Yeah, we could. Oh hey look! There's some Kappa Kappa Deltas! I was a Kappa. Hey sisters! Wow, we really are bitches.
No. I have got to get ready and go to a dinner at my bosses house. It's a very big deal, there's a lot of people there I have to meet.
How was the honeymoon? Phoebe; Oh, incredible! Oh! Champagne, candle-lit dinners, moonlight walks on the beach, it was sooo ro-man-tic!
So, I still have boxes here. I still have boxes at Ross's, and I have nowhere to live! Wow. I could so easily freak out right now.
Well y'know, some people make deals with a friend, like if neither of them are married by the time they're 40, they marry each other.
Okay. It's okay. We're gonna be okay. Y'know what? It's okay. I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna boil some water and just rip up some sheets!
Wh... Come on! Remember? We were on the sleeping porch! We couldn't stop giggling? And our coconuts kept knockin' together?
But, they're across the hall! I mean that's two doors away, it would take them a long time to peck their way back over here.
Hey, y'know what? You're the one who wants to make this big change and move in with Chandler! You should be the one to go! Why should I have to leave?!
Just tell Joey that you watched the tape and you liked it, but your bosses didn't. Then that way, you're the good guy and they're the bad guys.
Boy, you really can't stand to lose, can you? Your whole face is getting red... little veins popping out on your temple...
You know what else I'm not gonna miss? "I'm Monica. I wash the toilet 17 times a day. Even if people are on it!"
Wow that's uh, juicy. Umm, y'know what though Mon, I actually do have a lot of work to do so if-if-are you sure there's just not anything else?
BACK OFF!!! Get up! Get up! Get up! God damn it! Get up, get up, get up, get up, get up!!
All right, how about I go over there and I will walk into Chandler's bedroom and I will see that thing that I think that I know is actually the thing that I think that I know!
Y'know if what I do is so lame, then why did you insist on coming with me this morning? Huh? Was it so I just wouldn't go with Mark?
Ok, well Monica, suppose one of your "special" tickets win? How are you gonna feel when you win the lottery and you lose all your friends?
Oh that's right. You're the talker. Anyway uh, great idea! Umm, I gotta go to the store; I told him that I would buy him some more tissues.
Okay. Happy birthday Grandma! It's better to be over the hill then buried under it. All our love Monica and Chandler. That's funny, yeah!
Ok! Can't believe I'm risking this again, but you're on! All right Joe, you remember the rules! Heads I win, tails you lose.
I hate this apartment! I hate the color of these walls! I hate the fact that this place still smells like bird! I hate that singing guy!
Oh God Monica hi! I just went to your building and you weren't there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are, you are!
Jo-Joey, look honey we-we need to talk okay? Umm, I kinda got the feeling from her today that uh, she's not lookin' for a serious relationship.
Well y'know if you, if you started smoking again you could've at least told me! Come on, give me one of those! What are we talking about?
He plays for the Yankees. Seriously, ESPN! Just once and a while, have it on in the background. Ooh, this one was Pierce Brosnan!
Yes! He has a naked picture of Monica! He takes naked pictures of us! And then he eats chicken and looks at them!
When I was um, 7, I crashed my bike right out in front of his house and to stop me from crying he kissed me right here.
No, no, I mean, no, c'mon you guys, I mean, c'mon look it's only eleven thirty. Let's just talk, we never just hang out and talk anymore.
Yeah, there was. It was-there the corner of the library where-where all these dusty books that nobody ever read-Yes, there was.
No, it's just... look, you know, when I first moved to the city I was a lot like her! I was spoiled, self-centered and you guys really took care of me.
Okay, thank you. That'll be all. Wait! Wait! Did you see that? That mail guy had no idea there was something going on between us.
Okay, whoa-whoa easy there Melissa! This ain't a locker room, okay? But, y'know I remember him saying that-that he had plans tonight.
Well, um, first he told me he liked how I looked. And, ah, then we had a little . . . um . . . eye-contact.
Okay, it's just-and this is really embarrassing-but lately with this whole pregnancy thing I'm just finding myself...how do I put this umm, erotically charged.
Oh, that was just my crazy friend. She told me I should get off the plane, because she had a feeling that there was something wrong with the left Philange.
Okay! "Hello Ross, this is Dr. McNeeley from the Fake Accent University, we'd like you to come on board with us full time!
I'm sorry. Oh God, I'm sorry, it's just that when you moved your hands down to my butt, it was like woah, Ross's hands are on my butt. Sorry.
Anyway, Ralph just came in to tell me that he's so happy with my work that he wants me to be the new merchandising manager for polo retail.
Mrs. Kay! Oh yeah, she was sweet. She taught me Spanish. I actually think I remember some of it, tu madre es loca.
Ok, Monica. I just have to know one thing. Did you go with her to Bloomingdale's? Oh! Ok, ok, ok, I just really, uh, I just really need to not be with you right now.
Okay. Thank you. That's great. Thank you. Wait-wait! Where on west 10th? Because there's this really cute shoe store that has like this little...
Oh, I know it. You're right. That's not sexy. Oh...Oh! Whoops! Oh, I seem to have dropped my fork. Let me just bed over and get it. Oh God!
Well, you know, honey, I don't think everybody gets Smelly Cat. You know, I mean, if all you've ever actually had are healthy pets, then, whoosh!
You know what? Uhm, I have some goodbye stuff that I wanted to say to each of you and I was gonna save it until the end of the night, but come here .
Oh come on, what are you talking about? You've got three years painting houses. Two whole summers at T.G.I. Friday's, come on!
Uh, thank you Phoebe. Umm, well, what struck me most when reading Jane Eyre was uh, how the book was so ahead of its time.
Honey, it's going to be okay. He's been incredibly supportive of me, and if he gets a little upset; that's what the meatball sub is for.
The nights are the hardest. But then the day comes! And that's every bit as hard as the night. And then the night comes again...
Well, I have to be, I don't really have a choice, I mean, you know, I could look at the bright side, I get two birthday parties and two birthday cakes.
No Mon that's not the point. I'm out a thousand dollars, I'm all scratched up, and I'm stuck with this stupid cat that looks like a hand!
Oh it's all right. I'm guess I'm just done with the whole dating thing. It's one more thing in my life that's suddenly completely different. This is hard.
Go Monana! Well, you ladies are not the only ones living the dream. I get to go pour coffee for people I don't know. Don't wait up.
Oh, come on now, don't keep me waiting. Get those clothes off! But, I would keep that helmet on because you're in for a rough ride!
What? What, do you mean you're not feeling well? What do you have? Is it Rubella? Because don't go near Emma, she has not had that shot.
I accidentally kissed him in the interview, and now he wants me back y'know of course, 'cause "Let's bring the girl back who kisses everybody!"
Oh Ross, come on! This is not, this is not a marriage!! This is the world's worst hangover! Ross, listen, if you do not get this annulment, I will!
Y'know, like the thing when you put the phone in your pants? Tag! I'm serious! This isn't funny! Those contracts absolutely had to go out today!
Well, it doesn't sound like it! I mean, it's pretty easy not to kiss someone, you just don't kiss them! See look at us, right now, not kissing!
Hello? Oh, it's our nanny! Hi! Oh... God! I hope you feel better! Ok, bye! That's Molly, she's sick. Can you watch Emma today?
Okay. Okay. Okay. Umm, maybe you can start with, "Chandler, even though we were friends; there was a part of me that always knew I wanted more."
Well, anyway, they make these great novelty cakes, in all different shapes, and if you give them a photo, they'll copy it in icing!
Y'know honey, umm, as uh, as flattered as I am that uh, you saw me first, uhh, I just, I-I don't think we should be cranking anything up.
You guys, come on, it doesn't matter why we're late. We're all here now, please let us in so we can have some of your delicious turkey.
Well, I haven't seen him since that night that he told me how he y'know... I don't know, I think he's avoiding me. Why is that bagel on the floor?
Ugh! I cannot believe Chip dumped me for that slut Nancy Branson. I am never going out with him again. I don't care how much he begs!
Excuse me, sir. Hi, you come in here all time. I was just wondering, do you think there's a possibility that you could give me an advance on my tips?
No, I have to go downstairs and come back up as if I'm coming home from the regatta gala. Okay? So just go distract him. But don't be sexy.
Yeah. Yeah, and y'know you-you deserve to win. And-and y'know I was thinking about it, if-if you're Monica's maid of honor that means I get to be yours.
Alright, I feel that this is totally unjustified. She gave me the green light, I did nothing but-. Do you think I can't see you in the TV set?
Oh look, she's pulling away again! Do you think my nipples are too big for her mouth? She looks scared. Doesn't she look scared?
Ross, Ross, please listen to me. Ross, you are so much better for me than Paolo ever was. I mean you care about me, you're loving, you make me laugh.
Oh my God. Oh my God Ross, no, hang up the phone, give me the phone Ross, give me the phone, give me the phone, give me the. . .
Yes, and I know that you'd say no if he asked you, but I'm sorry; how great would you look walking down the aisle in this Donna Carin.
Wow! I mean, I just-I can't, I can't believe this. Y'know, I mean you think you know someone even, even Phoebe who's always been somewhat of a question mark.
Wow! Oh-okay, look pal, I am not in the mood to be hit on right now! But if you give me your number I will call you some other time.
Alright, okay, okay, gleba, gleba... Gleba! Ha! Here it is: the fleshy, spore-bearing inner mass of a certain fungi.
But you have it right there in that file? You could tell us whether it's a boy or a girl? Dayton or Sandrine? Phoebe or Phoebo?
Oh, ju-ju-just stay calm. Just be calm. For all he knows we're just hanging out together. Right? Just be nonchalant. That's not nonchalant!
Look, Charlie, I just want you to know. Ross is just having a little trouble adjusting to the thought of Joey and me. You know, he normally doesn't drink like this.
Ok, I know this is gonna sound really stupid, but I feel that if I can do this, you know, if I can actually do my own laundry, there isn't anything I can't do.
Oh that's all right! Y'know, I ended up having a really good time. Y'know, the charity was a big success and they raised a lot of money and awareness.
Yes, okay, oh, by the way, I just gotta say, I think it's really nice of you that even after you've moved, you still keep storing that stuff for Joey!
Chip! Hi, it's Rachel. Rachel Green. Yeah, umm, you left me a message. Yes you did, my roommate wrote it down. Monica Geller. Ohh.
How do you know that? What if it just gets worse and worse and worse, to the point where we can't even be in the same room with each other?!
Yeah. I'm-I'm telling you he's really sweet and he's really funny and he's just ugh, got a good heart. And besides, I y'know, I think he really likes you.
Wait a minute! Wait a minute! I'm not saying that you shouldn't have a bag, I just-it's just there are other bags that are a little less umm, controversial.
Yeah, who's gonna eat all our food, and tie up our phone lines, and - is that my bra? What the hell you doin' with my bra?
Ooh! You guys are so lucky you are here with people, you known it's such a romantic place. That's all, I just wish I could share that with a guy.
I'm telling you guys, we followed them out to a house in Westchester, the went in for like forty-five minutes and then they came out looking pretty happy!
Oh god. Oh, am I being like a total laundry spaz? I mean, am I supposed to use like one machine for shirts and another machine for pants?
Listen. Sudden change of plans. My maternity leave just ended. They told me that if I didn't come back today, they were gonna fire me.
Yeah... ....OK. Where were we? Oh, OK... five card draw, uh... jacks or better... nothing wild, everybody ante.
Well, look, it's hardly snowing anymore. I mean you couldn't ask for a more romantic setting. This could be the simple wedding you've always wanted!
Oh, yeah. And uh, the best part though, when the uh, waiter spilled water down my back, I jumped up, and my boob popped out.
Don't just say yes! This isn't a game, Joey you can really get hurt out here. Okay, so do you want to pay attention or do you want to die?!
Okay, your band is playing at Arnold's, collect three cool points. Which means, I have five, and that means I get Joey's boxers!
It's impossible to find a good doctor. I mean, how do you know the good ones from the ones who are gonna push their penis against your knee?
Come on Joey, I just bought you a new chair! The most expensive one in the store! Hey, y'know what I was thinking? We could name her Francette.
Yes oh--Do I want sugar in my coffee? No, just some milk would be good Carol. Thanks. Okay, do you remember all that stuff I taught you yesterday?
But, what you and I have is so much better. Ok, we have tenderness, we have intimacy, we connect. Ya know, I swear, this is the best I have ever had.
No Joey, look. Trust me, all the men are wearing them in the spring catalog. Look. See look, men, carrying the bag.
No-n-n-n-no! I am finally thinking clearly. My lucky dress wasn't working out to well for me, but for four years, this baby never missed.
Well said. And a uh good example of the fun I was referring to uhh, but I just think I'm past the point where I think I can y'know, just have fun.
Yeah, that's gonna get you into Soap Opera Digest. Well I......I would just like to say that Joey truly has enriched the days of our lives.
Wow. Is it, is it 'cause she's so cold in bed. Or, or is it 'cause she's like, kinda bossy, makes it feel like school?
Y'know, I never thought I'd say this about a movie, but I really hope this dog dies. What are you doing over there? Come sit here, you protect me.
Oh, oh, and hey-hey-hey, those little spelling tips will come in handy when you're at home on Saturday nights playing Scrabble with Monica!!
Well it's not, honey I'm sorry, I guess I'm just nervous. I mean, it's you, ya know, it's us. I mean, we're crossing that line, sort of a big thing.
Yeah, but it was different with him today! And he wasn't, like, Orthodontist Guy, y'know? I mean, we had fun! Is there anything wrong with that?
Ross! Your honor, rest assured relationship ended like two years ago! And could you strike "Consummated like bunnies" from the record?
Ya know, I just, so weird. I mean I was in there just listening to them bitch about each other and all I kept thinking about was the fourth of July.
Right! Right! I-I actually meant in your spare time, do you cook? Do you ski? Or do you just hang out with your wife or girlfriend?
Uh, OK, I mean uh, what, how are you gonna handle it. I mean, are, are ya gonna, are ya gonna talk about it before hand, are you just gonna pounce?
Yeah, I know, I know, I know he does. But I have to tell him how I feel! He deserves to have all the information and then he can make an informed decision.
Hmm. Look, Ross, if you want your neighbors to like you, why don't you just pay the hundred bucks? The party's gonna cost you way more than that.
So I don't go back to work for another four weeks, but we would like our nanny to start right away, so that Emma could get a chance to know her.
I just can't believe this is happening. I mean, when I was little, everybody's parents were getting divorced. I just figured as a grownup I wouldn't have to worry about this.
What do you think Monica mean when she said she didn't want to talk, especially with me? I mean, why not especially you and me? We were both out there kissing.
I don't know, I don't know, weren't you the guy that told me to quit my job when I had absolutely nothing else to do. Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!!
Oh, I remember how we almost. Do you think we would've gone through with it? Y'know, if we hadn't gotten caught. Do you think we would've done it?
Oh, please, Ross it was so obvious! It was like you were marking your territory. I mean you might have well have just come in and peed all around my desk!
Oh, well, that shouldnt be so hard, now that youre dating. "Sweetheart, youre fired, but how bout a quickie before I go to work?"
Right,.. well,.. we never actually got to that... Oh, it was just so nice to see him again, y'know? It was comfortable, it was familiar... it was just nice!
And also, you know I uh, I was thinking about what you said, you know, about the whole sex thing and... it's probably not a great idea to go down that road again.
Oh, I don't know, I guess, Chris O'Donnel, John F. Kennedy, Jr., Daniel Day Lewis, Sting, and Parker Stevenson.
You have! Ross, you should give yourself credit. I mean my Mom never thought this would work out. It was all, "Once a cheater, always a cheater."
If anybody asks, I'm your sister, Joan. Listen. C'mon, you guys. Ross said my name up there that obviously means that he still loves me!
That was you?! We heard about you in Junior High! Did you really just shake your fist in the air and shout, "I will be revenged?!"
Maybe it, maybe it doesn't have to be this tough. I mean, maybe you were on the right track with this whole, you know, spontaneous thing. I mean, women really like that.
Noo, I y'know I don't see why she has to play with you, that's all. I mean doesn't she have any y'know other stripper moms friends of her own?
Look, I know you guys heard about the whole thing with me and Ross but y'know, I've been obsessing about it all day and I'd just love not to talk about it. All right?
Sorry. I'm so exited! I've been waiting for this for months! I got my hair coloured! I got new sheets! I'm making him a very fancy meal.
Oh, Phoebe! Come on! You know what, it's already three o'clock and they haven't even gotten to Emma's group yet. We gotta go, we got dinner!
Hey! You...can't...leave Joey! You agreed to buy that boat, all right?! That is a contract! And plus if you leave, my boss is gonna kill me!
'Cause I am really happy about us. I think we are, I think we are so on the right track! Y'know? I mean, I think we are working, I think we are clicking. Y'know?
Ross, I am trying to help her become a better person. This is a huge breakthrough for her! She just offered to do something for another human being!!
See look Amy, we're a lot closer to Monica and Chandler. We see them every day. And truthfully honey, you don't seem very connected to the baby.
Hi, I'm here to see mr Campbell... with Gucci. The reservation is probably under Gucci. It's spelled like Gukki, which could be confusing.
I don't know! I think it's kind of serious! Oh, you know... I was watching this thing on TV this morning about... Newcastle disease... and I think I might have it!!
Well, yeah, y'know how Ross and I were on again, off again, on again, off again? I guess I just figured that somewhere down the road, we would be on again.
Phoebe, hi, we're so sorry. You're totally right. We are here one hundred per cent and we love you and we are ready to start your birthday celebration.
What Phoebe? Wait! One time he caught me smoking he said if he ever saw me doing that again he'd make me eat the entire pack.
What are you talking about, Ross, you just said that you read it twice! Look, y'know what, either it does or it doesn't, and if you have to even think about it...
No, I know, they're from me. Look you guys this is not good. I mean we have enough trouble with guys stealing our wind without taking it from each other.
Oh! Oh! Can I give out the candy? I really want to be with the kids right now. Y'know, ever since I got pregnant I-I have the strongest maternal instincts.
Yeah, you got like 14 hours until she has to be at the airport, and you're sitting here in the hallway with a 28-year-old cheerleader with a fat lip.
No. No. Every thing's--they're fine. Great pizza. But it's uh, actually umm my friend Ross. He uh, just gets really nervous when he's flirting.
And you know, we said that we would, we would live together as long as this makes sense. An maybe this, you know,Just doesn't make sense anymore.
Did, did he just, did he, did he just say, he said bye. He said bye. You said, you said bye to me. You said bye to me.
Uh-huh! Nice try, but you don't get that chair anymore! All right? That is my chair now! You can sit on my lap! No I take that back!
Oh Phoebe, listen. Well, I think we gotta go. This place is really freaking me out. I've been watching this guy over there, I don't think he came with a kid!
You see, now, I would date this girl. She's cute, she's outdoorsy, you know, and she knows how to build a fire. I mean, that's got to come in handy
...and I know Chandler is kidding but it happens every time he touches my stomach. I mean I'm really worried the baby's not going to like him. Are you okay?
Would you like to go to a basketball game with me? You know, its funny, basketball, because I happen to have tickets too... Umm, who likes the Knicks-
No Ross!! Don't! You can't just kiss me and think you're gonna make it all go away, okay? It doesn't work that way. It doesn't just make it better. Okay?
Ah, what is this? Well, lets see, we kissed for ten minutes and now we're talking to our friends about it, so I guess this is sixth grade!
Oh wow. Why don't we just take me and put me with a Manhattan in my hand, talking to the cute bartender. These pins aren't for playing are they?
Well, I mean, do you think you can ever have both? Y'know? Someone who's like, who's like your best friend, but then also can make your toes curl?
Ross, didn't you ah, play soccer in High School? Oh no wait, that's right. You just organized their game schedules on your Commodore 64.
Oh God Monica hi! Thank God! I just went to your building and you weren't there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are, you are!
Me too. Oh, I'm just sorry I'm not gonna be around to watch you two attempt to handle this! Alright, I can't say goodbye to you guys again. I love you all so much.
All right listen umm, I just bought something I'm not sure she's gonna like it, and it's gonna seem a little crazy, but this is something that I wanted since I was a little girl.
OH, a soap opera roof party!! I'm going to a soap opera roof party!! Oh my God, oh my God!! And it's out of my system!
You had no right coming down to my office Ross. You do not bring a picnic basket to somebody's work! Unless maybe they were a park ranger!
Oh no, my dad's a doctor and he would always tell me just horror stories......about ghosts and goblins who totally supported the princess's right to smoke.
Oh-ho, my God! That was so awesome! You totally got him back for calling you fat! He was just drooling all over you. That must've felt so great!
Ross, see! I told you, those swings are evil! Alright, that is it. That is the last time Emma is getting on one of those things for her entire life.
I know, I mean, why can't parents just stay parents? Why do they have to become people? Why do they have... Why can't you stop staring at my breasts?
Just a touch. Mon, I don't understand. I mean, you've been dating this guy since like, what... his midterms? I mean, why all the sudden are you so... Oh.
Pheebs, you go with Monica and try on her green dress. If that doesn't work, you can wear my gray silk one. Oh, gosh, what am I wearing?!
Y'know what, just give me a second and I'll be out of your hair. I'm just gonna grab a jacket. When I get back, I want every little detail. Maybe that's him.
Yeah, ohh! Why, damnit, why did I open my mouth? I have a crush on you; I am attracted to you. Gee, I-I know that I freaked him out
Yeah, well, word of advice: Bring back the comedian. Otherwise next time you're gonna find yourself sitting at home, listening to that album alone.
Ah that's great. No actually that's... That's great! That's really great! Y'know, I gotta tell ya writing, I mean writing, gets me uh, gets me kinda hot.
Yes, they will! You know what you should do? Just go take a walk, all right? I know your size and I'm... I'm gonna pick up some really good stuff for you.
Okay, you know what? I don't have it, but I can tell you exactly where it is on my night stand, and...okay. But you know what? I have my drivers license and I have a twenty.
Yeah, and he does it every year! That's why he's sending you to that play! That's why he sent us to that medieval restaurant and to that button factory!
You guys, I'm telling you, when she runs, she looks like a cross between Kermit The Frog and The Six Million Dollar Man.
Oh God! Y'know what I wish? I wish you were six years older. Well actually, if I'm wishin' for stuff, I actually wish I was six years younger.
Umm, our situation. Y'know umm, what we mean to each other. And I mean we-we're having this baby together, and we live together. Isn't that, isn't that weird?
Okay! Y'know what? I realized it was stupid to get upset about not having a husband and kids. All I really needed was a plan. See I wanna have three kids...
Okay, Ross, Phoebe is my girlfriend, okay, we tell each other everything. You know, I mean, come on, guys do the same thing, I mean, what about all that locker room stuff.
Look, I know that you guys really want to get to Vermont and this isn't a really big deal to you, but it really is to us, ok? Emma will never have a first birthday again.
I don't care! All right, y'know what I'm just upset that I'm getting nowhere with Joshua that-y'know what still, you do not meet someone and go flitting off to Vermont!
Umm, listen, I'm gonna need to take a rain check, my roommate is just really sick. Okay? Bye! Honey, listen, I know, I know things seem so bad right now.
Well it happened about six weeks ago, and uh I had just got home from work and Ross was already there 'cause I guess he had been hanging out with Joey.
All right, okay, Laurie proposes to Jo, and she says no, even though she's still in love with him, and then he ends up marring Amy.
Are you, are you, are you sure it's ah, a new bump? I mean, no offense, I've always thought of Ben as a fairly bumpy headed child.
I am! I am a woman who spent a lot of money on a dress and she wants to wear it, because soon she won't be able to fit into it.
"...marenge, thank you honey, and do the cha-cha. And while she like to be a star, Tony always tended bar. At the, wait, wait, everybody.."
Okay, he's a, he's a black capuchian monkey with a white face... ...with, with Russian dressing and, and pickles on the side. Okay. Thanks.
Well yeah, but then I remembered I started it and there was this pep rally and I was, I was on top of the pyramid but anyway-umm, what is this book about?
Alright, don't tell me, don't tell me! Decaf cappucino for Joey.. Coffee black.. Late.. And an iced tea. I'm getting pretty good at this!
Oh, y'know I'm not that much of a sweet tooth. I--Wow. My God, so creamy. Oh my God, this is the best cheesecake I have ever had. Where did you get this?
...see I can't decide whether it would go better next to the new wicker dining chair, the Sahara desk, or the Parker console table.
Oh..Go..Oh..and I told my boss that someone made out with Ralph Lauren. If she finds out that I lied to her, she is going to hate me even more. Phoebe!!
Ohh, God! Look at him, he's so cute. I wanna go over there, grab him, and kiss him! How can I kiss him and not letting him know that I like him?
I'm great! I'm great. I've got a great job at Bloomingdale's, have wonderful friends, and eventhough I'm not seeing anyone right now, I've never felt better about myself.
It's not dumb. But, maybe it's okay that you're not a part of it. Y'know what I mean? I mean it's like, I-I-I like that you're not involved in that part of my life.
Oh but you could. You can. Absolutely! We can help each other out! We can get--what are those--those patches! We could be like the Patch Sisters!
Okay, no, that's not the right decision. That's not, that's not right, no Ross-Ross, come on! I mean, that woman made you miserable! Okay, Ross, do you really want to get back into that?
Oh. I'm sorry. I'm very sorry. Sorry. It's just, I'm ahh, I'm kinda excited. I'm, ahh, going to London to ahh, tell this guy that I love him and...
The whole night was horrible, it was pouring down rain, and when I got there, there was no Rachel Green on the list, but there was a Rachel Greep.
Well they have uh, some unusual pet names for each other. Including umm, evil bitch and uh, sick bastard. Oh God oh! Contraction!
That is not a tattoo, that is a nothing. I finally got her back in the chair, bairly touched her with a needle, she jumped up screaming, and that was it.
Honey, that's very sweet, it just seems to me though, that if two people love each other and trust each other, like we do, there's no reason to be jealous.
You went shopping?! What, and then you just came in here and paraded it right under Jill's nose when you know she's trying to quit. Wow, you guys are terrible!
No. No, no, I'm not ready! How can I be ready? "Hey, Rach! You ready to jump out the airplane without your parachute?" Come on, I can't do this!
I don't know, I'm not trying to do anything, it's just, we have such a good time when we're together, you know... I mean, aren't you just a... little curious... what that would be like?...
Yes okay. Well now see this isn't telling us anything. Joe. Carlos. Peter. Ooh! Peter Luger! T hat's a steak house!
Chandler! Chandler, please, I have to get you locked up back the way you were, I am sooo gonna lose my job, she's very private about her office. Now I know why.
Terry, I, I, I know that I haven't worked here very long, but I was wondering, do you think it would be possible if I got a $100 advance in my salary?
I don't know. I don't know how I feel. This is all happening so fast. I have to make all these decisions that I don't want to make. Somebody just take this away from me!!
Joey, just-just he-he's new in town and I know he doesn't have any guy friends. Just take him to like a ball game or something. I'll really appreciate it.
Okay. Y'know what? I'd have to say I really don't care for your tone. And this is not the only hospital in this city and we have no problem to-Whoa! Oh gosh! Whoa!
All right, look, here's the bottom line Ross, this is fixable, if we act fast, okay. So, I'll invite him to brunch tomorrow and you can make nice.
I know. I always thought if you and I got married, it would be the one that stuck. And it wouldn't be a secret, and we wouldn't have our wedding dinner at Pizza Hut.
Yeah, I'm pretty confident about that. That's what makes it so easy for me to be 80% happy for Monica and Chandler! It would be nice to have a little guarantee though.
No well, no it's not that bad, y'know? I mean yeah, my tongue feels a little fuzzy and these fingers sort of smell, I actually feel like I can throw up.
Ross!! Are you crazy?! I am still your wife!! What, were you just never gonna tell me?!! What the hell is wrong with you?!!!! Ugh, I could just kill you!!!!
Well, you've been here for two months now and your boss is required to hand in a performance evaluation. But y'know, there is one thing that I have yet to evaluate.
Listen, my mum is not bringing the baby back until nine o' clock. So I was hoping you and I could have achance to kind of talk... somebody here?
Well of course I do! But y'know, favorite returning character is a tough category Joey. I mean you're up against the guy who survived his own cremation.
Uh well, uh this is a silent auction. They lay out all the stuff here and then you write down your offer and then the highest bid gets it.
Okay. Now this is just the first chapter, and I want your absolute honest opinion. Oh, oh, and on page two, he's not 'reaching for her heaving beasts'.
Oh, you know what - my first impression of you was absolutely right. You are arrogant, you are pompous ... Morgan! Morgan! Tag's last name was Morgan! Huh!
Okay Joey honey, you're doing really good! All right, now I'm just gonna need you to step to the port side. Remember? Remember how we talked about the port side?
No we weren't! It was nothing! It was one night, senior year we went to a party, had a lot of sangria and y'know, ended up...kissing for a bit.
No, it's all right, you can just drop the act Tommy. I know what's going on here. Your Danny's wingman right? You guys are best buds. Frat bros!
Okay, you just go on and make your little jokey-jokes, but if you do not know what you are doing out at sea you will die at sea. Am I getting through to you sailor?!
Yeah I am, I am! Oh, but first of all, Monica, I would like to introduce you to my very talented colleage and more importantly my wonderful friend Gavin Mitchelle.
Yeah, well that's that lo-cal, non dairy, soy milk junk. We sort of, we save the real stuff for those really terminal cases.
I know, I know, but uh just, I'm telling you, once, once you get past that part, that where it-it just feels like you wanna die, he's-he's really a good person.
Nothing, I mean, um, it is your first time with her and, you know if the first time doesn't go well, well then that's, that's pretty darn hard to recover from.
Well, well um, you know, these movies are offensive and uh, degrading to women and females. And uh, and the lighting's always unflattering. And, Monica help me out here.
I am? Oh, look at that, yes I am. Enough about me, enough about me, Mr. Back from the Orient. Come on. I wanna hear everything! Everything.
Guess what?! All that stuff about Nancy Branson being a slut was all a rumor so Chip dumped her and he wants to come over to my house tonight!
All right, y'know-Fine! You guys have your stupid little club, but I would just like to say is what you did to me is way worse than what I did to you! You gave me a tiney-wienie!
I don't know. I don't know... I thought about it all the way there, and I thought about it all the way back... and, uh, oh, you guys, y'know, it's Ross. Y'know what I mean? I mean, it's Ross.
Okay! Okay! Listen to what Sean McMahon wrote in my yearbook senior year, "Dear Rach, you're such a good person." Not girl! Person!
Anyway, speaking of drinking too much. I was uh, tellin' Phoebe about that one crazy night after the Sigma Chi luau where you and I uh, we made out.
Look I know she's a little tough to take. She has no where else to go, and she's my sister. Alright, she's Emma's aunt. And I would like them to bond.
He left work in the middle of the day to do a personal errand and left you in charge when you've been working here two days? That's not, that's not right.
Y'know what Ross? You're not going anywhere. You're gonna sit right here. I'm gonna make you a cup of tea and we're gonna talk this thing whole out. All right? Hey, Dave!
Oh no Ross! This is not good, we have to talk about this Joey thing. Please sit. You have got to get over this Joey thing, okay? I never really wanted to marry Joey, okay?
I don't know, you know, just the way she waltzed in here all smart, and tall! You know, and just swept Joey off his feet... I mean, nobody else has a chance!
What?! You mean they're not coming to a social event where there's no men and there's no booze?! That's shocking! I don't care, as long as my mom's here.
Yeah but, you don't, you don't, you don't want to try to much too fast. Y'know? I mean, you do remember what happened to the little girl that tried to much too fast don't you?
Okay, hold on real quick, hold on a second let me just uh, get a little more comfortable here. Wait, now wait a second, this isn't too revealing is it?
What do you mean, you fold? Hey, come on! What is this? I thought that 'once the cards were dealt, I'm not a nice guy.' I mean, what, were you just full of it?
Yeah. Thought I'd give it a shot. I'm still on the first chapter. Now, do you think his 'love stick can be liberated from its denim prison'?
Alright, alright. Calm down Norma Rae. They didn't actually say that. I'm just afraid if I don't come back right now this guy's gonna try to squeeze me out.
Look he doesn't have any brothers or sisters, somebody's gonna have to teach him this stuff! And I haven't taught him anything that a normal 6-year-old doesn't know anyway!
I don't care how long ago it was! You told people that I was half and half! Y'know what? I just want to point out I never did anything to hurt you in high school.
Ok, we can do this now, can't we Ben? Yes we can, yes we can. There. I did it. I did it. Look at that, oh, stays on and everything. Hi.
No...oh, I feel so stupid! Oh, I think about the other day with you guys and I was all "Oh, Paolo, he's so great, he makes me feel so..." Oh, God, I'm so embarrassed!
Ah, why, now I can't get a massage? There are so many things that she disapproves of! I can't eat veal, I can't wear fur, I can't go hunting...
All right, we were shaking hands and he kinda leaned toward me... Y'know maybe he was going to open the door, but I totally miss read him and I uhhh...
Yes. Emma and I came in a little early to do research on the presentation. I actually made a few changes, but I think I'm caught up on everything. So ask me anything!
Oh. Huh. You know, it is weird that Phoebe would set me up on a date that was awful on the same night that Joey set you up on a date that didn't even show.
No, it's not gonna be okay Ross, tomorrow is my last day, and I don't have a lead. Okay, y'know what, I'm just gonna, I'm just gonna call Gunther and I'm gonna tell him, I'm not quitting.
No, there is no Rachel Greep, but then this other girl overheard us and she was all, "I'm Rachel Greep! I'm Rachel Greep!" and he let her right in.
Look, y'know I know my life's going pretty well, but I look around and I just see so many people who've accomplished so many other goals by the time they're thirty.
...And so then I realised. All this stuff I had been doing. proposing to Joshua, lying to Ross about why I couldn't come to the wedding. Was all just a way of...
Oh yes, absolutely! Y'know, it's weird uh, but I had a dream last night where I was stopped by a policeman. And then he uh...well I probably shouldn't tell you the rest.
Chandler, don't worry! This doesn't make you any less of a guy! That does! What am I sitting on? I hate to think what this woman was scratching when this broke off.
What?! She just called and said that she was gonna be working late! She keeps lying to me! That's it! Y'know what? I'm just gonna go over there and confront them right now!
Yeah-yeah, y'know if-if there was just like one little area where I-that I think we need-we would need to work on; I-I would think it was we're just not crazy enough!
Clearly you don't want people to see this tape. Now I don't want people to see this tape either, but you so badly don't people to see it makes me want to see it. You see?
Oh er... well you know Emma started crawling? I realised that this place, is very unsafe for a baby. So I went to the store and got some stuff to baby-proof the apartment.
No! I'm not! I-I-I just think it's wrong! It's-it's that I'm-Here I am about to pop and he's out picking up some shop girl at Sluts 'R' Us!
Oh honey, this is for the best, thus I'm not distracted, worrying about Emma, how she's doing at home and I'm being completely here with you and, oh, she spit up!
Well, you have been in our lives for nearly two months now and we don't really know you. I mean, who is Julie? I mean, what do you like, what don't you like? We wanna hear everything.
Well, come on, Steve; let's not rule out nervous laughter. Hey, now wait a minute. Phoebe told me that - that you owned your own restaurant. That's impressive.
Okay. Uhh, Ross, y'know what, there's something that I-that I have to talk to you about and everybody's saying that I shouldn't tell you, but I think they're wrong. I mean, and you know how people can be wrong.
Uh, yeah, well, see, he... Joey knows, that I'm-I'm very insecure about my back and, and...you're hugging me, so obviously you are not repulsed by it, yeah!
Oh Ah! Oh my gosh there's something every mother needs, a giant stuffed gorilla that takes up the entire apartment! What are people think... Oh you guys I love it.
As I was saying... I should probably have the first of the three kids by the time I'm 35 which gives me five years. I love this plan! I wanna marry this plan!
Oh you know what? When I was a little girl I had a little pink pony named Cotton. Oh I loved her so much, I took her everywhere, I would braid her tail...
Well, it was good.. until we got back to our apartment, and then we were fooling around and he started to put his hand up my leg and I kept slapping it away!
Oh my god Chandler! If you can't handle this, what are you going to be like in the hospital? With the blood and the screaming and the little present that's shooting out of her!?
Whoa!! Whoa, whoa, wait a minute. What time did your little friend leave? Oh my God. She was there? She was still there? She was in there, when I was in there?!
I'll be right there! Okay, Ross, please come on! I thought we have moved on! I thought we've gotten to a place where we could be happy for each other! I mean was that just me?
Oh man! This is so great! I actually feel like I'm going on a real date! Although, I have a hint of morning sickness, and I'm wearing underwear that goes up to about......there.
Now wait a minute that's not fair. He was married to me a hell of a lot longer than he was married to Emily, he just didn't tell me. Maybe I have to pee again.
Oh, I mean she's gonna be at the wedding waiting for him and people will be whispering, "Oh that poor girl." Y'know? Then she'll have to come back here and live all alone.
I don't know. It's so complicated. I work with this guy, you know, I have the baby, and I have Ross, and I just...I don'tknow what to do and I have to be at the office and see Gavin in ten minutes.
Well Phoebe, we gotta do something! Well, y'know. I mean there's no way Joey's gonna make it in time. So I'm gonna through the hotel and see if there's any other weddings going on.
Really? Well, it seems to me if you'd done the right thing, I would not have woken up today feeling stupid and embarrassed, I would have woken up feeling comforted and satisfied!
Hi, it's me. I've been trying to reach you all night. I feel awful. Please, Ross, you gotta know there is nothing between me and Mark. This whole break-up thing is just stupid.
What handsome is not your type? Smart? Kind? Good kisser? What those things aren't on your list? Ross is a great guy! You would be lucky to be with him!
That is so sad. Your missing out on so much, Ross. I mean, the bonding and the sharing, you know. And-and knowing that someone else is going through the same thing you are.
Well yeah, I do, but I decided to take a long lunch and spend some time with my friend Monica. Y'know I-I feel that we don't talk anymore. How are you? What is new with you?
No, there isn't time to go to the bakery. We're just gonna come home... Everybody left? Alright, well just tell Emma we're gonna be there as soon as we can. Bye...
Yee. I mean, it was so weirdest thing. They fired me and then out of nowhere they just hire me back! I mean, that place must have been falling apart without me.
Why hasn't he called Rachel? Why? Why? I don't understand. Why? He said he'll call. Why? Why? Chandler I'm telling you she has flipped out, she's gone crazy!
Ok, I, I hear what you're sayin'. I'm with you. Um, but I, but I'm trying really hard. And I think I'm doing better. I really do. Does anybody need coffee? Oh, look at that.
Oh, no, Michael, it's not you. I'm sorry, it's just, it's this thing. It's probably not as bad as it sounds but this friend of mine is, is getting a cat with his girlfriend.
Are any of you guys free tonight? My boss is hosting this charity event for underprivileged kids and the more people I bring, the better I look. So, Monica? Chandler?
Look! I cleaned! I did the windows, I did the floors... I even used all the attachments on the vacuum, except that little round one with the bristles, I don't know what that's for.
No. Joey, she knows! We were at Ugly Naked Guy's apartment and we saw them doing it through the window. Actually, we saw them doing it up against the window.
Ohh please don't be from a real dinosaur! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Made in Mexico! Yes!! Ugh, who would buy this?!
Mrs. Bing, I have to tell you, I've read everything you've ever written. No, I mean it! I mean, when I read Euphoria at Midnight, all I wanted to do was become a writer.
It's just some things I've been thinking about. Some things about us, and before we can even think about the two of us getting back together, I just need to know how you feel about this stuff.
So. I just thought the two of us should hang out for a bit. I mean, you know, we've never really talked. I guess you'd know that, being one of the two of us, though, right?
Oh! Wi... in the dres... in the dressing room!? Well, that's so weird! Phoebe and I were just trying on clothes in the dressing room. God it's just such a small world!
I know, I get it, but Mona, what relationship is not complicated? I mean we all have our baggage! You must too! Why else would you still be single? I am so gonna leave right now.
I know Mona, just hear me out. First of all, I'm so sorry about my father yelling at you, but I heard you totally held your own. You're gonna have to tell me how you did that.
Y'know what? I am going to do something today. I'm not just gonna sit around like some old lady. I'm gonna get something pierced. Like my uh, like my nose or my tongue or something.
Well yeah, but I mean, it was good scared though, you know? Like when I-moved-to-New-York scared. Or uhm, when I-found-out-I-was-gonna-have-Emma scared... But this is... fine. This is gonna be good.
Well, apparently she caught him cheating on her with someone else. Isn't that sad? God, could you imagine if I actually married him?! I mean how different would my life be?
Oh yeah, c'mon, I'm movin' on. He can press her up against that window as much as he wants. For all I care, he can throw her through the damn thing.
Oh, I don't know. Well maybe it's just the idea of Barry for the rest of my life. I don't know I think I feel like I need to have one last fling, y'know, just to sorta get it out of my system.
Oh, she wants to see me tomorrow...Oh, she sounded really weird, I gotta call Barry... Hi, it's me, I just.. Mindy!! Mindy! Hi! No, I figured that's where you'd be!
No, no-no, it's okay, calm down. Mark and I talked, and I realised how much I love your stupid brother, and, yeah, we got our problems, but I really want to make it work.
I know, isn't he great? It's so nice to finally be in a fun relationship, y'know? There's nothing boring about him, and ah, I bet he's never set foot in a museum.
Ok, ok, ok, moving on, moving on, next question. Ok number 29, have you ever betrayed another goddess for a lightning bearer? Ok, number 30.
Oh well, hello. This is your lucky day Mr. Bowmont, the uh gentleman day sailer as just become available again and I believe that you made a bid of $18,000.
I've never interviewed anyone before. I've actually never had anyone work for me before. Although when I was a kid, we did have a maid, but this is-this isn't the same thing.
No-no-no-no-no Ross! Please, come on we do not have any of the big stuff we need! We do not a changing table! We do not have a crib! We do not have a diaper service!
Hi! Y'know what honey, we're actually out of candy right now. But someone just went out to get some and I have been giving out money but I'm out of that too. Hey, can I write you a check?
Okay, first of all, if you keep calling it that, no one's gonna ever take it. Then, second of all you're not actually gonna have sex with him! You're just gonna make him think that you are.
Who are you talking too? Oh, you're kidding! Oh, it's a joke! It's funny. It's funny. I don't get it. Oh. Okay. Umm... I-I...uh, wow. Are you uh... How did umm... When?
Handling it? What do you mean, handling it? There's nothing to handle. Now, maybe I would have a problem with this if it wasn't for me and Joshua. Y'know, they're not gonna get married anyway!
But you will, you will be performing a service. Okay? Just-just think of me as a ketchup bottle, y'know you sometimes you have to bang on the end of it just to get something to come out.
Yes!! I mean sex does not have to be a big deal! There shouldn't be all this rules and restrictions! Y'know, people should be able to sleep with who ever they want, whenever...
Okay. Thank you! Thank you! Because-I'm sorry, all right. Because y'know what? She didn't want me-not important. The point is, I was right. Your decision. Okay? I was right. Your decision.
Yeah. It was the weirdest thing. Zelner called me and he said we'll do everything we can to get you back. And that I should thank some Ron... I don't even know what department that guy's in.
Well, this sounds like fun! Well, you know what? Actually? People are getting a little antsy waiting Emma to wake up from her nap, so would you mind performing them once now?
Yeah, it was senior year in college. It was after the Sigma Chi luau and Melissa and I got very drunk! And we ended up kissing! For several minutes!
Ross, hi, it's Rachel. I'm just calling to say that um, everything's fine and I'm really happy for you and your cat......I am over you. I am over you and that, my friend, is what they call closure.
Well, it is, all right? When we were out there today, all I kept thinking was: I can't believe Chandler is screwing this woman, but MAN this would be a nice place to live!
Huh-Wait so Joey if you get this, you're gonna be like the star of your own TV show! I mean you'll be like the Big Cheese! Or the Big Mac-Hey! You love those!
And the chicken pooped in her lap. Oh, I'm so sorry. I just gave away the ending, didn't I? Oh! It's just, I just heard this story in the cab, and it is all I can think about.
I do not know what's wrong with us, I mean, we have kissed before and that's been great! But this time it was leading somewhere and I was very aware of the fact that it was Joey touching me.
You should find out what his hobbies are and then use that to bond with him. Yeah! Like if I would strike up a conversation about say umm, sandwiches. Or uh, or my underwear.
Phoebe, honey, if you hate it so much, you should walk out there right now and quit! Be true to what you believe in! Honey, you have principles and I so admire that! I don't have any!
Rachel Green's office!! Give me that phone! Hello, this is Rachel Green, how can I help you? Uh huh ... ok then ... I'll pass you back to your son.
Well, first of all, Paulo and I are not back together. It was just a stupid thing I did, and if I could go back in time and do it again, well, I wouldn't. Um, second of all , what?
No, listen to me. I fell for you and I get clobbered. You then fall for me and I again, somehow, get clobbered. I'm tired of being clobbered, ya know, it's, it's just not worth it.
Oh really? Well how would you like it if I had sex with you and I taped it? Oh forget it! Oh there he is now, the father of my child, the porn king of the west village.
I mean, we are way past the fling thing, I mean, I am feeling things that I've only read about in Danielle Steele books, you know? I mean, when I'm with him, I'm totally, totally...
Well, um . . . I don't know. I mean, for a long time nothing. But you know, actually right before you picked me up, Ross and I had a . . . ah . . . little thing.
All right, all right, you're right, I won't do anything with Joey, I just thought that we Ok so that would be two cups of tarragon, one pound of baking soda and one red onion?
Like a little girl. I know. I know. I know. This is all my fault; I wanted him to open up. But God, I didn't know that I was gonna unleash this-this weepy, clingy, moist monster!
I'm fine! I'm fine! I'm just losing a tooth, it's no big deal. I have a dentist! Y'know. I'm gonna go put some ice on it. Excuse me. What do I do now? What do I do now?
Oh please. That Paolo thing was barely a relationship. All it really was was just, ya know, meaningless animal sex. Ok, ya know, that sounded soooo much better in my head.
Okay. Okay. I think we can do this if we just get organized. All right? We have two days to plan this party. We just need to make fast decisions! Okay? All right, where are we gonna have it?
Alright! Don't get too comfortable there, because I'm back in two weeks! And I want everything back to the way it was. I can't say that I care too much for the way you've rearranged my office.
I know. Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. All right, this is what we're gonna do, we are gonna go to the next highest bidder, and we are just gonna let them buy it, and then you're just gonna pay the difference.
Okay, well you are just gonna have too, okay. Because I already got a Mother and a Father who cannot stay in the same room together, okay, I don't wanna have to have a separate room for you too!!
All right! Let's get this over with! Ugh! Ohhh! No! Look what I did! Oh, I mean, look at this mess! I mean, we're probably gonna have to clean this up! Y'know? We're gonna have to reschedule!
Ross, those things go like 40 miles an hour! Ok? When you're... and there is that moment when you are at the top, when you just don't know if you're gonna return back to earth!
No, it's Ross. It's Ross. You like Ross. Oh daddy, I hope you're okay with all of this. I mean think about it, this is a good thing. You're gonna-This is your first grandchild! You're gonna be a poppy!
I, I don't know, um, do you think you're cute? OK, we're kinda gettin' off the track here. Um, I was supposed to come here and tell you my friend thinks you're cute. So what should I tell her?
Yes. Hi, I'd like to order a pizza. Okay, can I ask you a question? Is-is the cute blond guy delivering tonight? Very Ambercrombie & Fitch. I'll call you back.
Oh, no no no no. I see what you're doing here, alright, listen, this is my job buddy. Okay, I've had it for five years, and I know how it works, so why don't you just catch me up!
Ross do you realise this is the first time in my life I'm doing something I actually care about. This is the first time in my life I'm doing something that I'm actually good at. I mean. if you don't get that...
Hello, Mark? Hi, it's Rachel Green. Oh no, don't you apologize. Yeah, I'll hold. He left my number at work, but he was helping his niece with her report on the pioneers.
Oh honey, come on, I'm sorry, I didn't.... I don't mind paying my dues, y'know, its just how much am I gonna learn about fashion by walking Mira, the arthritic seamstress, to the bathroom.
You guys are gonna love meee! Okay, check it out, Thursday night, five tickets, Calvin Klein lingerie show, and you guys are coming with me. Okay, I said that out loud right?
I know. Oh-oh, wait did you hear that-hear that? Listen, I'm gettin' something from your grandmother, she said that since you get to keep the one bedroom apartment you should give Rachel the purple chair?
Oh, look at me, look at me. Oh, I'm on a date with a really great guy, all I can think about is Ross and his cat and his... Julie. I just want to get over him. gosh, why can't I do that?
Ross, that girl just spent the entire evening talking to your friends, asking to hear stories about you, looking through Monica's photo albums, I mean you don't do that if you're just in it for two weeks.
Ugh! Look you guys, I'm really excited about this! Okay? I don't care what you think! I'm gonna go set up a little litter box for Mrs. Whiskerson. Well, what am I gonna call her? Fluffy?!
That is totally different for two reasons. One - I didn't know that you knew that. And two, I wasn't some creep staring at his ass, we had a deap meaningful relationship.
Yes, I know that. I know that. And I know that hiring him was probably not the smartest thing that I've ever done. But I'm telling you, from this moment on I swear this is strictly professional. Yes?
Hey, now wait a minute! I get when you told people at first that you wanted to be an actor they laughed at you! Now come on Bobby, why don't you tell us a little bit about your band?
Oh well, the woman I interviewed with was pretty tough, but y'know thank God Mark coached me, because once I started talking about the fall line, she got all happy and wouldn't shut up.
Did you get all this stuff for Joey to try and drive me out of the apartment? Honey, if you wanted to do that, you might as well just gotten him a fish, you know how fish freaked me out!
Hi! I'm gal pal Rachel Green, and if you want the dirt, I'm the one you come too. This might be Joey's baby , who knows? I'm just kidding-Seriously, gal pal Rachel Green.
Yeah. Yeah, I-I-I see the scare. Listen, Paul, I think this is really great that-that y'know, you shared your feelings. It's really, it's beautiful, but umm, what do you say we go share some food?
At the Copa, Copa Cabana The hottest spot north of Havana. At the Copa, Coo-pa Ca-ban-a, music and fashion were always the passion, at the Copa....
No, I-I just don't know how you decide who to hire. I mean I've got it narrowed down to two people. One of them has great references and a lot of experience and then there's this guy...
Ok...this could be a little awkward...I'm just going to blow past it... well can't you just use that method actor thing where you use your real life memories to help you in your performance?
Ross said my name. Okay? My name. Ross said my name up there that obviously means that he still loves me! Okay, don't believe me, I know I'm right-do you guys want to go downstairs and get a drink?
Oh, um, no, no, no, no excuse me, hello. Hi. My friend ordered an onion, not an olive, and uh I ordered a rum and Diet Coke, which I don't think this is.
Barbara! Hi, how are you? Uh-huh. No, I understand. Yeah. Oh, oh, come on, no, I'm fine. Don't be silly. Yeah... oh, but you know, if-if anything else opens up, pleaHello? Hello?
Listen y'know what sir? For the last time, I don't care what the computer says, we did not take a bag of Mashuga nuts from the mini-bar and we did not watch Dr. Do-Me-A-Little!
Oh yeah, I'm jealous. "Oh Gavin, please, please look at my ass". Stop looking at my ass! I mean, I just think you are totally inappropriate, ok? This is a work environment, she's your subordinate.
Yes. Monica, you don't get it. It's bad enough that she's stolen the guy who might actually be the person that I am supposed to be with, but now, she's actually , but now she's actually stealing you.
Joey! Come on! I don't wanna make any mistakes, alright? This is the only dessert and if I screw it up everybody's gonna be like "Oh, remember that Thanksgiving when Rachel screwed up the trifle?"
Well, believe it or not, it's true. When Joey and I were together, he was wonderful. He was thoughtful and mature. And for the one week that we went out, he didn't sleep with anybody else!
Noo! Oh no! No! God no! He should not get back together with her. I know that! You know that! Even Ross knows that! But that still doesn't give us the right to erase his message!
Oh, I'm sorry. You know what? I cannot have this conversation with you. I mean, god, you just come in here, and drop this bomb on me, before you even tell Daddy. What? What do you want? Do you want my blessing?
Oh, I know, I know, it's-it's so, it's so totally like, "Whoa! Can we do this?" Y'know, I mean, but I mean it just feels right! Don't you think? It does! I mean, it just feels right, don't you think?
Ahh, hi! Hi! Melissa, what's up? I'm just uh, about to umm, go out to the store to get some stuff to put in my backpack. Y'know, like dried fruit and granola and stuff. What's up?
Well sure, if you say you're gonna take care of everything I have no reason to doubt you. Give me those forms! All right, now I'm gonna do this my way and I don't want to hear a peep out of you!
I don't know, you thought 'See you Saturday' was funny. Look honey, Mark is in fashion okay, I like having a friend that I can share this stuff with. You guys would never want to go to a lecture with me.
Oh, okay. Hey, can I ask you a question? Was it me, or-or was the guy who took my blood sample really cute? Y'know who I'm talking about, bald haircut, hairy fingers...
Okay, wait a minute. Wait a minute, I-I-I, I can't do this. Listen honey, this is, it's not Phoebe's fault. She lent me the earrings, and I lost it. I'm so sorry. Honey, I feel terrible too.
You're right. You're right. I mean I'm about to have a baby, I can tell my mother that I don't want her to just be sleeping on my couch! Oh my God! She's gonna want to sleep in my bed with me. This cannot happen!
Ohh, it's Joshua invited me to this fancy club opening tonight. But, I already told Mr. Waltham that I would take his niece to this dumb old opera. So... What are you gonna do?
Yeah, one time, when we were dating, uh we got a late checkout, he got so excited it was the best sex we ever had. Until y'know, he screamed out Radisson at the end.
Oh, why do you even bother? I already ruined her first birthday... And do you know how important these early experiences are Ross? Very! According to the back cover of that book that you gave me.
Oh my ... you think I'm a pushover. Well wait, watch this, you know what? You're not invited to lunch. What do you think of that? I think that's pretty strong, that's what I think. Come on, Monica, let's go to lunch.
I know. And Mom, I realize you and Daddy were upset when I didn't marry Barry and get the big house in the suburbs with all the security and everything, but this is just so much better for me, you know?
Hey! We were not on a-Okay. That's fine! Fine. Y'know what Ben? One day when you are a lot older I am going to tell you that entire story over a pitcher of real margaritas, okay?
Be-cause Ross is the father of my child! You know... and I... want him to hook up with lots of women! I just... All I'm saying is... I don't think that Joey and Charlie have anything in common.
Y'know, it was, uh.. it was actually really great. He took me to lunch at the Russian Tea Room, and I had that chicken, where y'know you poke it and all the butter squirts out...
Okay, Monica, can you just call it sex?! It really creeps me out when you call it that! Okay, and by the way, while we're at it, a guy's thing is not called his tenderness. Believe me! Hi!
Yes, so close. Mrs. Lynch, I know that this is an emotional and difficult time, for all of us. But by any chance did Joanna send any paperwork your way before... it happened.
I forgot... I am supposed to pick up a friend at the airport. I am so sorry! I'm so... if you want to stay, and finish your drinks, please do.... I meanI'm sorry. I-I-I gotta go. I'm sorry.
Oh, what a load of crap. That is a dot. Your mother is up in heaven going, 'Where the hell is my lily, you wuss?' OK, Phoebe, that is not a tattoo, this is a tattoo.
Y'know I can't even worry about that right now, cause I got the cutie little baby, oh I can't believe how much I love her, I can't get enough of her, like right now I miss her. I actually miss her.
Oh, okay. Is that what you want to do? You wanna go over and give a little shout out to the old, hot chickas? Okay, let's do that Sailor Joe. Quick question though, what's this called?
God! Don't-We can't let her start getting ready! This is too awful! Oh God, but wait she'll be in the gown and then he won't show up and then she's gonna have to take off the gown...
What the... DIAL IT DOWN! Listen, ok, and maybe they're crazy thoughts, but sometimes I do, I have, I've been thinking about... you know, us! Ok, dial it up a little!
You know Pheebs, when I was little, on my birthday, my daddy would hide a present in every room of the house, and then he would draw a treasure map to help me find 'em all.
Phoebe, we can't, we just can't just let it happen! Okay, we have to do something! We have to break them up! Okay? Just go in there and like, shave her head! You owe me one bald girl!!
Oh, with the mother, just... just constantly tell her how amazing her son is. Take it from me, moms love me. Ross's mom one time actually said I'm like the daughter that she never had.
Oh no!!!! Oh my God!! This is all making so much sense to me now! This is why Adam Carter wouldn't go out with me! This is why Billy Tratt would just stay in this region!
Hey, Chandler, don't freak out! I'm telling you something you already know! Come on, she broke up with Richard because he didn't want to have babies. And she's a woman, and she's almost 30, and y'know it's Monica.
Well, maybe sometimes I find out things or I hear something and I pass that information on y'know kinda like a public service, it doesn't mean I'm a gossip. I mean, would you call Ted Kopel a gossip?
Oh, I wanna quit, but then I think I should stick it out, then I think why would such a person stay in such a demeaning job, just because it's remotely related to the field they're interested in.
No! It didn't! That's what I want to talk to you about. Now, just to brief you... I may cry, but they are not tears of sadness or of anger, but just of me having this discussion with you.
What? What are you talking about?! You-you're the one who's been telling me to get over Ross and move on. I'm moving on, and you're moving on with me. Come on, give me one good reason why you don't wanna go.
I can't! It's too late! Terry already hired that girl over there. Look at her, she's even got waitress experience. Last night she was teaching everybody how to make napkin.... swans.
Oh yeah, I don't care how much she tells you she wants it, I don't care if begs, she pleads, she tells you she, she's gonna have sex with, with another man. That just means it's working.
Look Monica, getting cold feet is very common. Y'know, it's-it's just because of all the anticipation and you just have to remember that you love Chandler. And also, I ran out on a wedding. You don't get to keep the gifts.
Except it didn't. It happened to me. Oh, god, I'm gonna look like a big marshmallow peep. What am I doing? What am I doing? My father's right. I can't live on my own! I can't even do laundry!
Hello. But you know what, hey, new day, new leaf, I am just really really happy ... I'm sorry, obviously Heather's ass has something more important to say so I'll just wait 'till it's finished.
Hey, what do you think is a better excuse for why I'm not drinking on this date tonight. "Umm, I'm a recovering alcoholic. I'm a Mormon," or "I got so hammered last night I'm still a little drunk?"
No! No! No! No it's not! No it's not! Come on! Phoebe, ours is totally different! I mean we don't have the... We don't have the...that lamp! And-and that screen is y'know, on the other side.
I-I don't want your job. I-I don't. Ohh this is such a mistake. I did not make out with him. Nobody made out with him. I did not use my keycard yesterday. I don't even know how to use my keycard.
Well y'know, it's you guys. You-you do this kind of stuff! Y'know? I mean, you-you were gonna get married in Vegas and then you backed out! I guess I'm not upset because I don't see you guys going through with it. I'm sorry.
Well, I mean, are you sure you want to go out with her? I mean that ain't a pretty picture in the morning, y'know what I mean. That wig all in disarray, and boobs flung over the night stand, y'know.
Oh, yeah, sure. I mean, like in the case of this young woman, she has lost her clothes, so she rides naked on the horse, she's crying out, 'Where are they, where are they?'
Oh my God. I can't believe you live in that building. My grandmother lives in that building. Ida Green? No sense of personal space? Kind of smells like chicken? Looks like a potato.
Well, I... you know, I-I-I don't know what to say... I mean, I never thought of you as a guy who needed his men to be men. You know, 'cause I gotta tell you Ross, it not like you just came in from branding cattle.
Okay, well you had asked me how long we had known each other, and I said, "Eight years." And the um, waiter came over and cut his tip in half, and umm...now here we are.
Joey no, this is wrong! You have to take it back, okay? You don't want to win an award this way. You're very talented. And someday you're gonna win one of these for real and that one is gonna mean something.
Okay, here we go. I'm Jabba's prisoner, and you have a really weird look on your face. What? Honey, what is it? Did I get it wrong? Did I get the hair wrong? What? Did you just picture it differently? What? What?
Hey-hey, y'know what? I don't care! I'm not ashamed of my book. There's nothing with a woman enjoying a little...erotica. It's just a healthy expression of female sexuality, which by the way, you will never understand.
Honey, it's not just a matter of where you put it. I mean a baby changes everything. They cry all the time. I mean imagine bringing home some girl and trying to score when there's a screaming baby around.
I know... Honey, seriously, I did it all. The luggage that I'm taking is in the bedroom, this is Emma's Paris stuff, these are the boxes that I'm having shipped, and that's the sandwich that I made for the plane...
Really?! Aren't you sweet! I gotta tell you though, I am, I am having the hardest time placing you. Oh-oh hang on! Did we umm, did we fool around at Lance Davis' graduation party?
Oh my God! I bet that's him. My digital fairy tale is about to begin. I wonder how I should be? Should I be uh Hello? Or should I be Hi! It's Rach... Would you stop doing that?!
But, Pheebs, you can still use the copy machine where I actually work. But, just come by at lunch so my boss doesn't see you. Cause Kim will just freak out and she already doesn't like me very much.
You're right! I mean you're right! It wasn't just the Weebles, but it was the Weeble Play Palace, and and the Weebles' Cruise Ship. Oh, which had this little lifeboat for the Weebles to wobble in.
Yes! I will! Absolutely! Hello, Rachel. Hi, Joshua. I left my wallet here on purpose. Really? Yes, I just wanted to see you again. Oh, I'm glad. Rachel, I'd like to say something to you. Yes? How you doin'?
Oh, what are you going to do?! Are you gonna go run tell Monica?! Are you gonna tell Joey?! No! Because then you will have to tell them what we did! We are desert stealers! We are living outside the law!
See? Yeah, you told me the story. He and Monica dated when they broke up they couldn't even be in the same room together and you all promised that you would stay his friend and what happened? He got phased out!
Yeah, maybe, but I don't think I even care. I don't think he's the one I'm sad about. Y'know, I know that I said that I am totally okay with Ross getting married, but as it turns out, I don't think I'm handling it all that well.
Yeah well, not anymore I can't. He fired us! What are we gonna do? We have to find a pediatrician. Wait wait, Monica said that when you guys were growing up, you really liked your doctor. What was his name?
And you are so in style right now. Y'know, I work at Ralph Lauren and the whole fall line has got this like equestrian theme going on. I don't suppose you saw the cover of British Vogue, but...
Dr. Long, I've been at this for seventeen hours! Three women have come and gone with their babies, you gotta give me some good news! How many centimeters am I dilated? Eight? Nine?
Yeah! If you don't I will! Of course your body's gonna change. Your breasts are gonna get bigger, your ass is gonna get bigger, you're gonna lose bladder control. God! It's just such a magical time!
It was like months ago. We were walking by this antique store, and I saw this pin in the window, and I told him it was just like one my grandmother had when I was a little girl. Oh! I can't believe he remembered!
And so I had a lot of work to do so Ross, nice guy that he is, offered to help me out. And then we had a little wine, we got to talking, and the next thing you know out of nowhere Ross comes on to me.
I know, I know, I know, I know. I was just thinking about when they were there the last time, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. OK, OK, look, woah, I promise, I'm good, I'm not gonna laugh anymore. OK put your hands back there.
What? Uhh, Phoebe, honey, honey, I know you're quirky and I get a big kick out of it, we all do actually, but if you destroy a coat like this that is like a crime against nature! Not nature, fashion!
It's good. Except he makes us watch the Discovery Channel all day long. Did you know that something really boring happened to someone really ugly in the Middle Ages? Oh, thank you. I'll see you guys later.
Gunther... Oh... I love you too. Probably not in the same way, but I do. And, and when I'm in a cafe, having coffee, or I see a man with hair brighter than the sun, I'll think of you. Aw.
Okay fine! I'll-I'll just tell her it's an antique apothecary table, she doesn't have to know where it came from. Oh! Look at this little drawers! Oh look-look it says that it holds 300 CDs.
Ya know, I mean this is supposed to be a joyous occasion. My sister's graduating from college, nobody thought she would. It's a true testament to what a girl from long island would do for a Celica.
It was like months ago. We were walking by this antique store, and I saw this pin in the window, and I told him that it was just like one my grandmother had when I was a little girl. Oh! I can't believe he remembered!
But y'know what, if you think it's gonna be okay we'll just work out a system. Y'know, it'll be like college, I'll hang a hanger on the door and put a sign, "Come back later, I'm gettin' lucky."
Oh! I do not remember him! Wow! He's really got that sexy, smoldering thing going on. Oh my God, he's... Look at the way he's just staring at me. I think he's trying to mouth something to me, but I can't make it out.
Well, I just checked our messages and Joshua didn't call. I mean you'd think he'd be worried about me not showing up at his club. Ugh, you know what makes it so much worse, Ross is all happy in Vermont!
Oh my god. Ok you guys, there's Danny. Watch. Just watch this. See?! Still pretending he's not interested. Ohh, he's coming over. Just pretend like we don't know him. We've forgotten who he is.
Ok-dokey, Joey, listen. This is gonna be bridesmaid central, all right? We're gonna have hair and make-up going on in the bathroom and oh, I had to move a couple of things in the fridge to make room for the corsages.
This is a very critical time right now. If you feel yourself reaching for that phone, then you go shoe shopping, you get your butt in a bubble bath. You want her back you have to start acting aloof.
She climbs out of the frame, and then drags her half-a-body across the floor, just looking for legs to steal. And then with her one good hand, she slo-o-owly re-e-a-aches up and turns your doorknob.
And then, I don't know, I mean you'd pull me really close to you so that, so that I'd be pressed up, you know, right against you. And, um, it would get kind of sweaty and uh, and blurry, and then it's just happening.
Come on! We will be there for you the whole time! Just remember gal pal Rachel Green. Ha-ha! I'm gonna be in Soap Opera Digest! And not just in the dumb crossword puzzle. Seriously, proud of you.
I know! I know, she says it's all mass-produced, nothing is authentic, and everyone winds up having the same stuff. So come on, she's gonna be here any second! Can we please just cover this up with something?! Please?
Please. I haven't heard from her in seven months, and now she calls me? I mean, what else is it about? Oh! She was my best friend, you guys! We went to camp together... she taught me how to kiss..
Yeah, I know. I had the greatest day though, I got to sit in on the meeting with the reps from Calvin Klien. I told my boss I liked this line of lingerie, she ordered a ton of it. How was your day?
No, really. Really, Pheebs, you're not gonna be the one worrying about saving for college, or yelling at them when they're bad, y'know, or deciding to put them on Ritalin when they just won't calm down. Y'know?
Well I'll tell ya! See uh my-my boss and his wife-They-they can't have children. So umm, and that-we were at the Christmas party, and he got drunk, and he said to me, "Rachel, I want to buy your baby."
Ross, I said I'm sorry like a million times. What do you want me to do? You want me to break my foot too? Okay, I'm gonna break my foot, right here. Ow!! Oh! Oh my God, oh my God! There, are you happy now?!
It was cheesecake. It was fine. It had a buttery, crumbly, graham cracker crust, with a very rich yet light, cream cheese filling... Wow! My whole mouth just filled with saliva!
Yeah I know. She ran into him at my office and they just...made out. And the craziest thing is, now my boss likes me because I told her about it and she said it was the best gossip she'd heard all year.
Well, I haven't discussed it with him yet, but I know he's gonna be relieved. Last week, he brought this girl over and I started talking to her about morning sickness and then I showed her pictures from my pregnancy book.
In the afternoon. Mr. Zelner came into my office after lunch. He put them on my desk, and then I put a Post-It on it that said, "Must go out today." So you just keep looking in there! All right?
Well y'know, we would umm, repeat everything the other said, or uh, we'd jump out of closets to scare each other, or switch the sugar for the salt so they'd put salt on their cereal.
Let me uh, let me ask you something, do wedding vows mean squat to you people?! And why is it that the second we tell you we're going out of town, bamn there you are in bed with the neighbor's dog walker?!
I don't care! I don't care! You are going to have to take her out again and end it, and end it in way that she knows it's actually ended. And, I don't care how hard it is for you, do not tell her that you will call her again!
No, y'know what? It's gonna be okay. I mean you don't have to have this rustic Italian feast. Y'know? And-and you don't need, you don't need this custom-made, empire waisted, duchess, satin gown; you can wear off the rack.
Yeah, I went to a wedding once where they had swing music and uh, two months later the couple got divorced. And now I'm not saying that there's any connection here y'know, but they did tell me that's why they got divorced.
Oh, I wish he was a doll, then I could get a Rachel doll and bump them together and make kissy noises. Oh! And he has the most beautiful name, I never realised it, Joshua! Josh-u-a! Joshua! Josh.
All right Joey! That is enough! Listen, as beautiful and moving as this ceremony is, it's not legal. Okay? They-they don't have a marriage license, they don't have any witnesses, and the groom only has on one shoe!
Well, of course I am! It's not gonna happen to Ross! He's your brother. He's your old college roommate. Ugh, it was just a matter of time before someone had to leave the group. I just always assumed Phoebe would be the one to go.
Oh, well, you are so cute! I wish I could play with you more, but I've got to go to work! I hope I stop talking like this before my marketing meeting, yes I do. Yes I do. Bye-bye, Joey. Oh, I seriously can't stop it.
Yeah, when I was in the bathroom I saw the window that I crawled out of at my wedding, and God, I just started thinking that I shouldn't be here, you know I shouldn't, people are going to be looking at me and judging me and, and thinking about the last time.
God, isn't this exciting? I earned this. I wiped tables for it, I steamed milk for it, and it was totally not worth it. Who's FICA? Why's he getting all my money? I mean, what- Chandler, look at that.
Come on Phoebe, look at that! They are not breaking up, look at them. Okay that's, you know what that is? That is a, that is a second date, that's what that is! Look at that, she just put her hand on his thigh...
Well of course we will help you decide! We will do anything we can to help you! Now, I would like to make a toast, to the future Mrs. Chandler Bing , my best friend, and truly one of the nicest people that...
No! None! I mean, my first night in the city, he mentioned something about asking me out, but nothing ever happened, so I just... : W-well, what else did he say? I mean, does he, like, want to go out with me?
That's right! 'Cause that would give him the control! So now he's all ooh, coming up with this whole I've got a party thing y'know, trying to get me to hint around for an invitation. Blew up in his face, didn't it?
Yeah, and also we need more umm, drinks. Hold on a second. Whup, okay. Hello! Vegas? Yeah, we would like some more alcohol, and y'know what else? We would like some more beers. Hello? Ohh, I forgot to dial!
Oh, and then, we got into this big, stupid fight. I just, it was awful. I told him he treats me like a park ranger, or something, oh and then I told him I wanted to take a break, I don't want to take a break.
Ok, ok, ok. How did this happen to me? How did this happen to me? A week ago, two weeks ago, I was fine. Ross was just Ross, just this guy. Now he's Rrrooossss, oh, this really great guy that I can't have.
Well, uhm... whatever, I have really appreciated it, 'cause I don't think I would be the person that I am today if it wasn't for you guys. See, I wanna help Amy the way you guys helped me. And I know it's gonna take patience, but that's ok.
Look Joey, I'm sorry if-if you thought that was mean, but I gotta tell ya something. That was not mean. Okay, my father is mean. He used to yell at me all the time on the boat, I mean it was horrible. I was just being a good teacher.
They sent me home from work. They were like, "Start your maternity leave now! Just rest, get ready for the baby." Well y'know what? Screw 'em! If they don't want me there, I'll just hang out with you guys.
Ross, please, trust me. I buy 30 fashion magazines a month. Now, I don't know who's running for president or who that... NATO guy is, but I do know that you have to get as far away as you can from that hat.
Mum, please!I know you love your new lips, but I can barely understand you! Would you, please, just let me say goodnight to my daughter? TV: "And number 29! Here we go! The Powerball is 7"
Yeah that's great Paul, but y'know I wanna know what--Wow, those are really great! I just wanna know what, what is behind this-this strong, silent exterior. Y'know they say that still waters run deep and I wanna swim in yours.
Well Joey, you'll probably get it. But you should probably your-your gracious loser face. Y'know when like the cameras are on you and you wanna look disappointed but also that your colleague deserved to win. Y'know? So it's sorta like...
Ohhh well. Y'know what honey? The best thing to do to get over a guy is to start dating someone else. Oh! There is this great guy you will love at work named Bob! He's a real up-and-comer in Human Resources.
Ohh, gosh. You guys, come on, this is-I have to meet Joshua! This is my one chance for him to see the fun Rachel. Y'know the "Wouldn't it be great if she was my wife" Rachel. Ohh, all right! Are Joey and Chandler back?
Ohh, okay, I'm sorry. You're right. Y'know what? We absolutely can stay married, because I was under the impression that the boxes were far away from each other. All right, look, just please, take a moment here and think about what you're asking of me.
No, you don't, Ross. Imagine the worst things you think about yourself. Now, how would you feel if the one person that you trusted the most in the world not only thinks them too, but actually uses them as reasons not to be with you.
I mean, it's a cat, y'know, it's a cat. Why can't they get one of those bugs, y'know, one of those fruitflies, those things that live for like a day or something? What're they called, what're they called, what're they called?
Hey-whoa-whoa-whoa!! Ho-ho-hold on a sec there, Mr. Kissey! Y'know, I've been meaning to talk to you about this whole, little, new European thing you got going on, and I just need to tell you that it makes me very uncomfortable and I just-y'know-stop it!
They're having their baby! It's not fair Ross we got here first! Right after you left they wheeled her off into delivery. Oh but not before she gave me a juicy shot of little Jamie just crowning away.
Op, look! Claire forgot her glasses! And she's gonna be really needing these to keep an eye on that boyfriend, who, I hear, needs to keep his stapler in his desk drawer, if you know what I'm talking about.
Hi! Uhh, do you guys have plans for the weekend? Because I have my sister on hold, and she said that we could use her cabin for the weekend and go skiing. Huh? I'm asking you first, right?!. I mean I'm playing by the rules.
Why didn't he call? He's gonna stay with Julie, isn't he? He's gonna stay with her and she's going to be all, "Hi, I'm Julie, Ross picked me, and we're gonna to get married, have a lot of kids and dig up stuff together."
I believe you. So, it was right in the middle of a staff meeting so of course no one else wants to correct her so everyone else is calling me Raquel! By the end of the day, the mailroom guys were calling me Rocky!
Oh. Oh. Well there you go. Whew! That is-that's great-that is really great-great news. Y'know 'cause the whole not being ready and kinda the financial aspects, all that. Whew. Wow, this is so just the way it was supposed to be. God.
Ok, doggie get the- aahhh. Ok go get the sandwich, get the sandwich doggie. Good doggie get the sandwich, get the...ok, Joey, the dog will lick himself but he will not touch your sandwich, what does that say?
Yeah, but he waited until the last minute! So if I said yes, he would know I had nothing better to do than wait around for an invitation to his stupid party. I said, "No!" Which puts me right back in the driver seat.
So, if I wanna have my kid when I'm 35, I don't have to get pregnant until I'm 34. Which gives Prada four years to start making maternity clothes! Oh wait, but I do want to be married for a year before I get pregnant...
Okay, well then how about puberty! Come on, that's always a painful time! Y'know your friends invite you to a slumber party and then they stick your hand in warm water while you're sleeping so that you pee in your sleeping bag.
Yes, but I, I think about who's apartment we're gonna sleep at tomorrow night and, and where we're gonna have dinner next Saturday night. I do not think about what our childrens' names are gonna be. You know what our childrens names are gonna be.
Fine. Fine, but I'll have you know that once I taught him that stuff he called me Fun Aunt Rachel. And I loved being Fun Aunt Rachel but I'll go back to being Boring and Uncomfortable Aunt Rachel if that's what you want!
Yes, I was 4 years old and I was on the swing and then all of a sudden my hair got tangled in the chain. And to get me out my mom had to-had to cut a big chunk of my hair! And it was uneven for weeks!
I just don't want him to meet anybody until I am over my crush-And I will get over it. It's-it's not like I love him, it's just physical! But-I mean I get crushes like this all the time! I mean hell, I had a crush on you when I first met ya!
Ah! You know what honey guys are just different, they like things that we can't understand, you know I once dated this guy who wanted to pretend he was an archeologist and I was a naughty cave woman that he unfroze from a block of ice.
Oh my God Phoebe, this is impossible! We can't do this by Friday! We have to find a place. We have to invite people! We have to get food! There's just too much to do! It's impossible! We can't do it! We cannot do it! We cannot do it!
Oh wow! What now Ross you're not gonna talk? How on earth will you ever annoy me? Oh wait a minute, I know. I mean you'd think the damn jalepeno would've cleared up your sinuses, but no!! That's not enough... What are you doing?!
Well okay, how about four hours in a freezing museum auditorium listening to Professor Pitstains and he's 'Hey everybody! Remember that thing that's been dead for a gazillion years. Well there's this little bone we didn't know it had!'
No, no don't get mad because look-this is what happened. So I-I started packing, then I realized, "What am I doing? I am lousy at packing!" Right? But you love packing! So, as a gift to you, on our last night, ta-da!
Well. Woah, look at that! I gotta go, I gotta date. With a man. Um, OK, you guys have a really, uh, have a really good night and you two have a, uh, have a, uh, really good cat. OK, we're not supposed to take these when we leave.
It's so that I can spend Thanksgiving with my family. See, every year we go skiing in Vail, and normally my father pays for my ticket, but I sort of started the whole independence thing, you know, which is actually why I took this job.
Honey see, it doesn't mean that I don't love you. Because I do. I love you, I love you so much. But my work it's-it's for me y'know, I'm out there, on my own, and I'm doing it and it's scary but I love it, because it's mine. I, but, I mean is that okay?
Fine! I judged you. I made a snap judgement. But you did it too! And you are worse because you are sticking to your stupid snap judgement! You can't even open up your mind for a second to see if you're wrong! What does that say about you?
What if, um, if he calls his own cell phone to find out who found it and I answer and we start talking and we fell in love. I mean wouldn't that be a great story? Kind of like a fairy tale for the digital age.
Now I'm mommy in this little play? Alright look, I refuse to get sucked into this like, weird little Geller dimension thing OK. So I'm gonna go and take a nice long hot bubble bath because you kids are driving me crazy.
Oh how can you possibly know? Look at this mess, Tag! I mean, this is what I'm talking about! You have to be organized! You've got newspapers! You've got magazines! You got-Ohh! And who is this chippy? A little young for you Tag, but whatever.
Oh, I don't know. I guess it's not about no guys, it's about the right guy, y'know? I mean, with Barry, it was safe and it was easy, but there was no heat. With Paolo, that's all there was, was heat! And it was just this raw, animal, sexual...
Okay, well then how about a handshake? Oh God I'm sorry! Oh God, I'm sorry! I did not mean to touch that-I mean you there. There. Uhh, okay, so thank-thank you, I'm going to leave now thank you very much uh-huh, thank you so-Hey! I'll see you Monday!
Okay, I have to tell you something that I have never admitted during our entire friendship! But, when we were in high school I made out with James Farrell even when I knew that you liked him! Wow, that feels so good to get off my chest! Okay, you go!
Chandler, that's not enough. I mean what if she gets you a great present, two medium presents, and a bunch of little presents? And you've just gotten her one great present? I mean that's just gonna make her feel bad. Why would you do that to her Chandler? Why? Why?
Okay. Okay, we'll be here! Hating you! Did you see how he was sweating when he walked out of there? Listen honey, if I'm hogging the ball too much you just jump right in there and take a couple punches because I'm telling you, this feels great.
Okay-okay-okay-okay-okay-okay-okay! I got it! I got it! I got it! I can't! I can't! I can't! I cannot go with you and my sister thing. Okay? I just can't. It's just too weird, all right? I imagine the two of you together and I freak out. It freaks me out. I can't do it! I can't do it.
Pheebs, this whole apartment thing is just a nightmare! Every place I can afford comes with a roommate who is a freak. I mean, look at this; "Wanted. Female roommate, non-smoker, non-ugly." It's just, there is nothing! The city's full!
Oh, see now I feel bad for the kid! I had a crush on a teacher once and it was so hard! Y'know you-I couldn't concentrate and I blushed every time he looked at me. I mean come on, you remember what's it's like to be 19 and in love.
This is it, isn't it? I mean, this is what my life is gonna be like. My mom there, my dad there. Thanksgiving, Christmas. She gets the house, he's in some condo my sister's gonna decorate with wicker. Oh, Chandler how did you get through this?
No! No! No! I'm not yelling at you, I'm just yelling near you. Oh God Joey, ohh I'm my father. Oh my God, this is horrible! I've been trying so hard not to be my mother I did not see this comin'. Oh, Joey, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I just wanted you to learn.
Ooh, I miss dating. Gettin' all dressed up and going to a fancy restaurant. I'm not gonna be able to do that for so long, and it's so much fun! I mean not that sitting at home worrying about giving birth to a sixteen pound baby is not fun.
I overheard you guys on the phone the other day, and you said, "I'll just tell Rachel that I'm doing laundry for a couple of hours." And he said, "Laundry? Is that my new nickname?" And you said, "No! You know what your nickname is, Mr. Big."
Okay, y'know what?! I know-I know how to settle this! All right here, this is what we're gonna do! I'm gonna write Joey on one napkin and I'm gonna right Ross on the other napkin and we are going to pick one! And that person is going to be our backup! Okay?
Okay. All right Dina, well let's talk about the different areas of fashion that you could get involved in. Let's see, there's design, but you may need a whole other degree for that. Uh, there's-there's sales, which is great because you get to travel...
Yeah me too. oh! I have an idea. Why don't we all pitch in 50 bucks, we'll pool our money together and then if we win, we'll split it! Everyone almost simultaneously except Ross: yeah thats a great idea!
Well, there you go. You win, you win. You get to do the presentation, you'll knock 'em dead, no one will ever remember that I worked here, and then Ralph will buy his helicopter, and Super Gavin will just fly right along side of him!
What? Homo ergaster: Some scientists classify some African erectus specimens as belonging to a separate species, Homo ergaster, which differs from the Asian H. erectus fossils in some details of the skull .
But I do not want to have everything decided for me. I spent my whole life like that. It's what I had with Barry, that was one of the reasons I left. I, I like not knowing right now and I'm sorry if that scares you but if you want to be with me you are gonna have to deal with that.
Okay, Pheebs, y'know what, let's look at this objectively all right? Ninth grade, right? The obsession starts. All right? The summer after ninth grade he sees me in a two-piece for the first time, his obsession begins to grow. So then...
We have to have a surprise Bon Voyage party for Emily. But it's actually for Joshua. Look, he said he's not ready to date, so I had to invite him to a party if I wanted to see him outside of work, and now I have the perfect opportunity to seduce him!
Oh, yeah! Real fun. Y'know, this bra... Really, bothers me. Y'know, this used to be my bedroom. Yeah. A lot of memories in here, a lot of memories. If these walls could talk, y'know what they'd say? Wanna hear some memories?
Okay. All right, stand up. Well, when we're at the door, I lightly press my lips against his, and then move into his body just for a second, and then I make this sound, "Hmmm." Okay, I know it doesn't sound like anything, but I swear it works.
It's all gonna be okay. They're just so happy that I'm not suing them that they gave me one extra month paid maternity leave. So long as I understand that the money should not construed as a down payment on this or any other child I should bear.
I cannot believe that I did this. Especially after Monica just went on and on and on about it! "Okay Rachel! Here are the invitations Rachel! Now be very careful Rachel! Please, drinking no liquids around the invitations Rachel!" Whoa oh! Oh-oh-oh! Oh...oh-oh-oh...
I mean I think I'd say no to anybody right now. Oh, but it was so strange. I mean I'm standing there with this charming, cute guy, who's asking me to go out with him, which I'm allowed to do, and I felt guilty. Y'know, like I'd be cheating on Ross or something.
No! All right?! I did not see the bird! I did not see the fish! I did not see the piece of Styrofoam that was shaped like Mike Tyson! I did not, because I was trying to teach you how to sail a boat! Which obviously is an impossible thing to do!
All right. Woo! Hey, look at that, the airport's moving. Hey, are we moving?! Are we moving? Why are we moving? They said they were gonna wait! Miss? Yeah, does the captain know that we're moving? Oh my... Ross, you better be under the wheels of this thing!!
I know, it's huge, and it's scary, and it's... really far, far away from you guys, but this is such an incredible opportunity for me. And I've already talked to them about our situation with Emma, and they said they'll do whatever we need to make us feel comfortable.
Well, yeah, right, y'know what? Yeah, you're right, I mean, we no, we have our fun. Yeah! But if ......I mean, I mean like craaaazy! Y'know? Okay, all right. This is gonna, this is gonna sound y'know, a little umm, hasty, but uh, just go with it. Umm. Ugh. What if we got married?
No, she was already in, but then this big bitch behind me tried to steal my umbrella, so I clocked her. Ohhh! I can't believe this, all I wanted was a few hours outside of work to see Joshua, so he can go ahead and start falling in love with me.
Okay, I think we can get the evaluation back before they see it, but we're gonna have to get into Mr. Zelner's office. Now, he doesn't get in until 10, so he's no problem, but his assistant, Betty, she comes in early to eat her breakfast at her desk.
I'm off my break now so uh, um here you take this and um, I am gonna go pour these very nice people some coffee. Ok. Oh look at that, I don't have a pot. I don't have a pot. Well, hey, maybe I've got one at home, or in Scarsdale. Hey is that a door?
Okay, okay, I checked. We have: Earl Grey, English Breakfast, Cinnamon Stick, Camomile, Mint Medley, Blackberry, and.. oh, wait, there's one more, um.. Lemon Soother. You're not the guy that asked for the tea, are you? Okay.
OK, you're whiney, you are, you're obsessive, you are insecure, you're, you're gutless, you know, you don't ever, you don't just sort of seize the day, you know. You like me for what, a year, you didn't do anything about it. And, uh, oh, you wear too much of that gel in your hair.
No. I can't, you're a totally different person to me now. I used to think of you as somebody that would never, ever hurt me, ever. God, and now I just can't stop picturing with her, I can't, it doesn't matter what you say, or what you do, Ross. It's just changed, everything. Forever.
All right listen ball boys! My grandmother had one of these when I was a little girl and it was the sweetest thing! I mean it was so cute, it would sit in my lap and purr all day long, and I would drag a shoestring on the ground and he would chase it!
Okay, I'm not just waitressing. I'm.. I, um... I write the specials on the specials board, and, uh... and I, uh... I take the uh dead flowers out of the vase... Oh, and, um, sometimes Artelle lets me put the little chocolate blobbies on the cookies.
No, no, no, I'm looking at a purchase order right here and it clearly states that we ordered the Rivera bikini in a variety of sizes and colours. And.... What does it matter, what I'm wearing?! Can I please speak to your supervisor? Thank you. We're holding.
Well then uh, we better make this night count. Oh wait, I forgot to turn off the cappucino machine. Anchors away. Oh no no, my purse, my purse, my purse, my purse, my purse, my pu rse. Oh, you know what. I forgot to turn off the bathroom light.
Ross look, look this is good for you. Okay? Let's face it, so far the guy's not lovin' ya! But I can turn that around! I got the inside track! We can all go out to dinner, y'know? And I can talk you up! Ross, the guy is a very, very successful lawyer!
Yeah, I admit it. I have a crush on you, and uh, and, and I know that's crazy because we work together, and-and nothing could ever happen, and the last thing I want to do is-is to freak you out or make you feel uncomfortable. Which is why it would be really great if you said something right about now.
Joey, you can't let him get away with that. Ya know what, I'm not going to let him get away with that. I'm going to say something to him-No, I really shouldn't say anything-No, I should say something to him. Gunther, I want you to give Joey his job back. That is really not fair that you have to fire him...
Yeah, totally! You are in such good hands. And I'm so good with meeting parents. With the father, you know, you want to flirt a little bit, but not in a gross way. Just kind of like: "Oh mr. Pincer, I can see where Wallis gets his good looks..."
Look, I am so...so happy for you guys, but you getting married just reminds me of the fact that I'm not. I'm not even close. And I don't know, maybe I just wanted to make myself feel better. And I know that that's dumb, but oh my God you were so depressed when Ross got married that you slept with Chandler!
Yes! And not because I want you to go out with me, but because I don't want you to go out with anybody! Okay? I know it's a terrible thing to even think this, and it's completely inappropriate, but I want you to be at my constant beck and call 24 hours a day! I'm very sorry, but that is just the way that I feel.
Well, well, well, hop back in bucko, cause I got four sixes! I won! I actually won! Oh my God! Y'know what? I think I'm gonna make a little Ross pile. I think that one was Ross's, and I thinkohthat one was Ross's. Yes! : Well, I have got your money, and you'll never see it...
Yeah, well, y'know umm... No honey, listen I think it's a great idea to become friends with someone before you date them, but I think the way you do it is y'know you meet someone, become their friend, build a foundation, then you ask them out on a date. Don't hit on your existing friends!
All right. Look. Gavin...I...I guess I felt guilty that you were here, which I shouldn't. You know Ross and I are not inany relationship but...he is the father of my child, and you know we do live together and plus there is just so muchhistory...you know it's just...I don't know, I'm sorry, I'm just all over the place.
Oh, what is wrong with me lately? I mean it's like every guy I see-I mean look here. Look at that guy for example, I mean normally that's not someone I would-would be attracted to, but right now, with the way I'm feeling, all I want to do is rip off his sweatpants and fanny pack.
Yeah, you know, was I looking forward to going to Paris? Sure. You know, was I excited about working in the fashion capital of the world? Ooh, absolutely... Oh...! Yeah, but you know, this is... it's fine. I'm fine going back to a job where I've pretty much gotten everything out of that I possibly can...
Well of those things that you said in the interview, I mean if you believe any of them, I must not be a very good assistant. Y'know what? I am just gonna pack up my desk, and I will be gone by the end of the day! Well, I guess there's no use to me sticking around 'til the end of the day!
Sometimes just nodding is ok. Uhm, so but anyway, listen, not marrying Barry was the best decision that I ever, ever made. Honey, you deserve true love. Your soulmate is out there, somewhere. Someone that is your age, that is smart, that is fun and that you care about!
But honey he calls everybody by a nickname! Okay, look, I know, all right, just one dinner, please, just one night for me, please. I just want him to love you like I do. All right, well not exactly like I do, but, but, if you do come to dinner, I'll love you like I do in that black thing that you like.
Hi! So I'm out having lunch at Monica's and this guy starts talking to me, and it turns out he works for a buyer at Bloomingdale's and there happens to be an opening in his department. So I gave him my phone number and he's gonna call me this weekend to see if he can get me an interview!
So what do you say we make a pact? If you and I are both single by the time we're 40, we get married. I mean, we know each other, we like each other, and we've-we've already slept together so y'know there'll be no surprises there! You know what I mean? No like, "What's that?!"
Well, like anything can be sexy. Like umm, oh-oh, like this dishtowel! Ooh, ooh, this feels sooo good against my cheek! And-and if I feel a little hot, I can just dab myself with it. Or I can bring it down to my side and bring it through my fingers while I talk to him.
Ugh, it was horrible! And-and the interview part went so well, y'know? I even made him laugh. He said something about a boat and I was like, "Well, yeah! If you've got enough life jackets!" Trust me, it was actually, it was very funny. Anyway, so we were saying good-bye and ugh!
No Phoebe! You cannot get the phone that way; that's not fair! Okay look, I have an idea. Why don't we, why don't we see what kind of number he has on his speed dial, and then from that we can tell who has more in common with him. And then whoever does gets the phone.
Ross, hi, it's Rachel. I'm just calling to say that um, everything's fine and I'm really happy for you and your cat who, by the way, I think you should name Michael. And, you know, ya see there I'm thinking of names so obviously, I am over you. I am over you and that, my friend, is what they call closure.
Don't say that I have no sentiment! This is a movie stub from our first date! This is an eggshell from the first time you made me breakfast in bed! This is from the museum from the first time we... were together. Okay, maybe I exchange gifts sometimes, but I keep the things that matter!
Oh mom, I swear I'm not an idiot. I've read all kinds of books on pregnancy and giving birth, but I-I just didn't think to read the part about what to do when the baby comes. And-and then guess what? The baby's coming and I don't know what to do. Oh, can I throw up in my diaper genie?
Ahh, yes, I will have a glass of the Merlot and uh, he will have a white wine spritzer. Woo! Hey, look at that, the airport's moving. Hey, are we moving?! Are we moving? Why are we moving? Hey, time-out, umm, yeah, does the captain know that we're moving? Oh my God. Oh, my gosh.
Oh yeah! Of course, I mean, she's gonna get over this, y'know? I mean, so you said my name! Y'know you just said it 'cause you saw me there, if you'd have seen a circus freak, you would've said, "I take thee circus freak." Y'know, it didn't mean anything, it's just a mistake. It didn't mean anything. Right?
Anastassakis/Papasifakis wedding, excellent! {It's a good thing Jennifer Aniston is Greek, because she had to pronounce those names. Luckily for me, they were written on a sign.} Congratulations. Mazel Tov! Hi! Oh, great hat. Listen umm, I need you to perform another wedding. Can you do that?
You guys this cat is nothing like my grandmother's cat. I mean, it's not sweet, it's not cute, I even dragged that little string on the ground, and it just flipped out and scratched the hell out of me. And I swear, I know this sounds crazy, but every time this cat hisses at me I know it's saying, "Rachel!"
So, Spin The Bottle works like this I spin the bottle, it lands on Gunther, so I would have to kiss Gunther. (She crawls over to where Gunther is sitting and sees the look of anticipation on Gunther's face and decides not to kiss him.) All right. Who wants to go first?
Ross? Look, whatever this relationship stuff that Emily wants, just give it to her. Come on, the bottom line here is that you love her. So just fix whatever she wants fixed. Just do it. I mean, you're gonna have to try. You'll just gonna hate yourself if you don't. Oh come on answer it! It's driving me crazy!
Ah, I-I never should have said what I said. It-y'know what? It just doesn't matter how I feel. I mean we work together, so nothing could really ever happen between us, and what I would love is just to go to work on Monday, and-and never talk about this again, okay? Big day Monday lots to do. So, we're okay?
Well, it gets worse. When asked if you take initiative I wrote, "Yes, he was able to unhook my bra with minimal supervision," and under Problems with Performance I wrote, "Dear God, I hope not," and then uh, then I drew a little smiley face, and then a small pornographic sketch.
Well, you know what? This is great. Finally, I have someone I can pass on my wisdom too. Let me tell you about a couple of things I learned while working at the coffeehouse. First of all, the customer is always right. A smile goes a long way. And if anyone is ever rude to you? Sneeze muffin.
I mean what if this keeps happening? Y'know, they'll-they'll be outside smoking, making all the decisions and I'll just be up in my office breathing my stupid clean air, y'know? And then when the day comes when Kim wants to promote one of us, who do you think she's gonna pick? Me or Smokey Smokerson?
...the way you owned up to everything, it just showed me how much you've grown. Y'know? I mean my Mom never thought this would work out. It was all, "Once a cheater, always a cheater." Ooh, I just wish we hadn't lost those four months, but if time was what you needed just to gain a little perspective...
No, so I don't have to get married until I'm 33! That's three years, that's three whole years-Oh, wait a minute though. I'll need a year and a half to plan the wedding, and I'd like to know the guy for a year, year and a half before we get engaged... Which means I need to meet the guy by the time I'm thirty.
Hello? Mindy! Hi! Hey, how are you? Yes, yes, I've heard, congratulations, that is so great. Really? Oh. Okay. Okay, well I'm working tomorrow, but if you want you can, you can, you can come by and... Okay... Great... Great... All right, so I'll, so I'll see you tomorrow! Okay.. Okay... Bye. Oh God. Oh God. Oh God.
Oh my God this is sooo humiliating. I think the only thing that tops that was, was, was when I was in the eight grade and I had to sing the Copa Cabana in front of the entire school. I think I got about two lines into it before I ran and freaked out. Oh my God, my entire life is flashing before my eyes.
Monica, I'm quitting! I just helped an 81 year old woman put on a thong and she didn't even buy it! I'm telling you I'm quitting! That's it! I'm talking to my boss right now! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Okay bye, call me when you get this message.
Come on! They rushed into this thing so fast it's ridiculous! I mean, they're gonna be engaged for like what? A year? And somewhere along the way, one of them is gonna realise what they've done and they're call the whole thing off. I'm telling ya, you're gonna be dancing at my wedding before you're dancing at there's.
Well, Joey probably thinks I'll just embarrass him. Y'know, he thinks I'm some kind of a soap opera nut-Which I'm not! I'm not. Although I do know that your uh, your favorite ice cream flavor is butter pecan. And uh, and that your-your dog's name is Wally. Well look at that, I'm just stroking your arm.
I guess... Oh, I just had such an idea of what this day would be like, you know? Emma laughing and everybody gathered around her cake singing "Happy Birthday". Then we would all go into... HEY GET OUT OF THE ROAD YOU STUPID STUDENT DRIVER!!! They have to learn!
Yeah, he dumped me. He said, "Rachel, I can't do this. Even though you are a very, very, very beautiful woman. I can't do this. I'm married and I'm sorry." And then I don't know why but he said, "and you will never get promoted. Especially not above Kim, who is an integral cog in the Ralph Lauren machine."
Because , because, I just heard it. I heard it, and it's ridiculous! I mean, you're married. You're-you're married and it's just ridiculous, and it's like, it's like when said it, I sort of like, I floated up out of my body, y'know? And, and-and then I heard myself say it and then the floating Rachel was like, "You are such an idiot!"
It's a truffle. It's got all of these layers. First there's a layer of ladyfingers, then a layer of jam, then custard, which I made from scratch, then raspberries, more ladyfingers, then beef sauteed with peas and onions, then a little more custard, and then bananas, and then I just put some whipped cream on top!
It's a trifle. It's got all of these layers. First there's a layer of ladyfingers, then a layer of jam, then custard, which I made from scratch. Then raspberries, more ladyfingers, then beef sauted with peas and onions, then a little more custard, and then bananas, and then I just put some whipped cream on top!
Obviously you know how to haggle, so I'm not gonna try and take you on. Okay? So $800 and I don't call the cops because you're robbing me blind! Blind! Just take cat, leave the money, and run away! Run away! Damnit! Cat, can't you at least smile or something?! Okay, did anybody just hear that? Anybody?
Um, ok, uh, oh god, um, when you and uh Ross first started going out, it was really hard for me, um, for many reasons, which I'm not gonna bore you with now, but um, I just, I see how happy he is, you know, and how good you guys are together, and um, Monica's always saying how nice you are, and god I hate it when she's right.
Mon you definitely have to make it a theme wedding, and the theme could be, "Look how much money we've got!" Y'know, I mean you could put, you could put money in-in the invitations! You-you could have like little money place settings. And ah, you could start with a money salad! I mean it'll be dry, but people will like it.
Um, excuse me, everyone. Ah, this is my last night working here, and I ah, just wanted say that I made some really good friends working here, and ah, it's just time to move on. Ah, and no offence to everybody who ah, still works here, you have no idea how good it feels to say that as of this moment I will never have to make coffee again.
No! Put that box down! We are not going anywhere! This is my apartment and I like it! This is a girl's apartment! That is a boy's apartment, it's dirty and it smells. This is pretty. It's-it's so pretty! And look, and it's-it's purple! And I'm telling you, you with the steady hand, I am not moving, and now I have got the steady hand.
Okay, fine. Gunther, y'know what, I am a terrible waitress, do you know why I'm a terrible waitress? Because, I don't care. I don't care. I don't care which pot is regular and which pot is decaf, I don't care where the tray spot is, I just don't care, this is not what I want to do. So I don't think I should do it anymore. I'm gonna give you my weeks notice.
Thank you. Thank you very much. Umm, I've known them separately and I've known them together and-and to know them as a couple is to know that you are truly in the presence of love. So I would like to raise my glass to Monica and Chandler and the beautiful adventure they are about to embark upon together. I can think of no two people better prepared for the journey.
Because it is too damn hard Ross. I can't even begin to explain to you how much I'm gonna miss you. When I think about not seeing you every day, it makes me not want to go... Okay, so if you think that I didn't say goodbye to you because you don't mean as much to me as everybody else, you're wrong. It's because you mean more to me. So there, all right, there's your goodbye... Oh!
I don't care about the little dude! I can't! I cannot listen to anymore of this! Y'know, the only person who would want to listen to this is a mental health professional! And then it's only because they get paid $100 an hour! Do you know how much money I could've made listening to you? $2,000! And do you know when I figured that out? While you were talking!
Yeah, I mean, you know it, I mean, if it were me I, I, you know, I'd want you to, I don't know, like catch me off guard, you know, with like a really good kiss, you know really, sort of um, soft at first, then maybe um brush the hair away from my face, and look far into my eyes in a way that let's me know that something amazing is about to happen.
Well, my boss was at the same restaurant where I was having my interview and he heard everything. So later he calls me to his office and he tells me that he's gonna have to let me go, because I'm not a team player. And I said "Wait a minute! Yes I am." and I had to sit there for 45 minutes while he proved that that in fact... was true.
Alright. In high school I was the prom queen and I was the homecoming queen and the class president and you... were also there! But if you take this monkey, I will lose one of the most important people in my life. You can hate me if you want, but please do not punish him. C'mon, Luisa, you have a chance to be the bigger person here! Take it!
Hey, y'know, at least you have somebody to miss that stuff with! I hate being alone this time of year! Next thing you know it'll be Valentine's Day, then my birthday, then bang!-before you know it, they're lighting that damn tree again. Ohh, I want somebody! Y'know, I want a man!! I mean, it doesn't even have to be a big relationship, y'know, just like a fling would be great.
Yeah. It's just gonna be too hard. Y'know? I mean, it's Ross. How can I watch him get married? Y'know it's just, it's for the best, y'know it is, it's... Y'know, plus, somebody's got to stay here with Phoebe! Y'know she's gonna be pretty big by then, and she needs someone to help her tie her shoes; drive her to the hospital in case she goes into labour.
Okay! Okay! Umm, Webster's Dictionary defines marriage as... Okay!! Forget that! That sucks!! Okay, never mind! Forget it! Umm, umm, okay, uh... I met, I-I met, I met Monica when we were just a couple of six year olds and I became friends with Chandler when he was 25, although he seemed like a six year old.
Okay look, let me paint you a little picture. All right, you are settin' sail up the Hudson! You've got the wind in your h--arms! You-you get all that peace and quiet that you've always wanted! You get back to nature! You can go fishin'! You can-ooh, you can get one of those little hats and have people call you captain, and then when you're old, Cappy.
My parents happened. All they had to do was sit in the same stadium, smile proudly, and not talk about the divorce. But nooo, they got into a huge fight in the middle of the commencement address. Bishop Tutu actually had to stop and shush them. But you know what, you know what the good news is? I get to serve coffee for the next 8 hours.
What?! I didn't have a good time in Greece! Ross abandoned me! Okay, I couldn't get a plane out, so I had to stay in their honeymoon suite with people coming up to me all the time going, "Oh, Mrs. Geller, why are you crying?" I mean, it was sooo humiliating. I felt like such an idiot! I mean, it's all my fault! And you know why, because I make very bad decisions.
Here is a book of poetry that I know Monica loves. And-and ohh God this is funny, look, this is a picture of one Halloween where she dressed up as a bride. And look, she made me carry her train, which was weird because I was Wonder Woman. Oh and here's a little purse that I found. Y'know I just thought that maybe they could hold the rings in there.
Wh-whoa! All right, okay-okay, I see, I see what's going on here! Now listen, look-look, I'm sorry if I gave you the wrong impression, but I am not some hussy who will just sleep around to get ahead! Now even though I , hey-hey-hey, even though I kissed you, that does not give you the right to demand sex from me. I do not want, this job that bad. Good day, sir.
I am still talking!! And then you chase away the one guy that I actually liked! I mean, no offense to you guys. Really! I mean congratulations on all the cash, and-and y'know--Wow! You do have very soft hair! But I would much rather go to the ball all by myself than go through anymore of this! Good-bye! Now do you use some sort of special conditioner on that hair?!
Oh, you guys are gonna have so much fun! She's at such a cute age. Oh, a couple things. Now that she's eating solid food, she poops around the clock. And watch out for your hair, 'cause she likes to grab it. And oh, she's also in this phase where if you leave the room, she screams bloody murder, but ah... Thanks, you guys. Have fun!
Oh! Look what happened! {Don't get your hopes up guys, we only get to see her from the back or from the neck up. Its times like these I wish that the networks would broadcast some nudity other than Denis Franz's butt.} Huh, check me out! I'm in my kitchen...naked! I'm picking up an orange. I'm naked! Lighting the candles, naked, and carefully.
C'mon Daddy, listen to me! All of my life, everyone has always told me, 'You're a shoe! You're a shoe, you're a shoe, you're a shoe!'. And today I just stopped and I said, 'What if I don't wanna be a shoe? What if I wanna be a- a purse, y'know? Or a- or a hat! No, I don't want you to buy me a hat, I'm saying that I am a ha- It's a metaphor, Daddy!
Oh come--Of course I know that. I mean of course you never leave a baby alone! I mean who would-she wouldn't be safe as she would be with me, the baby dummy. Oh God, okay. Y'know what? I think opening the presents right now is a little overwhelming right now. So I think umm, I'm just gonna maybe open them a little bit later, but thank you all for coming. And for these beautiful gifts, and this basket is beautiful.
Well obviously I won't be able to come, for those of you who haven't checked their calendars today is my due date. Well y'know, I just want to take a moment and thank you guys for how great you've been during this time. I really couldn't have done it without you. And I have loved these last nine months! And even though I am so looking forward to the next part, I am really gonna miss being pregnant.
Yeah. So y'know, I have all of these feelings and I don't know what to do about them, because I can't date like a normal person, which is fine because I don't need a relationship, I mean all I really want is one great night. Just sex, y'know? No strings attached, no relationship, just with someone that I feel comfortable with and who knows what he's doing. For just one great night, I mean is that really so...hard...to find. So how was your day?
All right, it's okay. One little setback is okay, just don't let it happen again, all right? Now since daddy paid for all this stuff, I should take it all away. But I'm just gonna take the-the pajmena. And the uh, and the uh pants. Y'know what, I'm just gonna take it all away, 'cause that way you'll just really learn the lesson. Okay? All righty, I'm gonna run a couple of errands and I will see you at dinner.
Jill, honey, I think this is the best thing that could've ever happened to you. I mean you needed to get out on your own anyway! And you know when I did it, I-I-I at first I was scared, and look at me now! I'm the only daughter dad is proud of! Okay, well this is, this is what you're gonna do. You're gonna get a job, you're gonna get an apartment, and then I'll help you and you can stay with us. Right Pheebs, she can stay with us?
C'mon Daddy, listen to me! It's like, it's like, all of my life, everyone has always told me, 'You're a shoe! You're a shoe, you're a shoe, you're a shoe!'. And today I just stopped and I said, 'What if I don't wanna be a shoe? What if I wanna be a- a purse, y'know? Or a- or a hat! No, I'm not saying I want you to buy me a hat, I'm saying I am a ha- It's a metaphor, Daddy!
And uh, yeah, I didn't really, I didn't want to say anything, but it kinda it just, it kinda kept coming back to me, and umm, remember we were in the casino and for some reason thought it would be funny to eat a lot of grapes. And uh, and I thought it would be funnier if we got married. So as a, as a compromise we decided first to get married, and then to eat a lot of grapes. So umm, sorry I got us into this mess.
Okay! Okay wait! You listen to me! You listen to me! Since I have been waiting four women, that's four, one higher than the number of centimeters that I am dilated, have come and gone with their babies! I'm next! It's my turn! It's only fair! And if you bring in one woman and she has her baby before me I'm going to sue you! Not this hospital, I'm going to sue you! And my husband he's a lawyer!
Hi, Mindy. Hi, it-it's Rachel. Yeah, I'm fine. I-I saw Barry today. Oh, yeah, yeah he-he told me. No, no, it's okay. I hope you two are very happy, I really do. Oh, oh, and Mind, y'know, if-if everything works out, and you guys end up getting married and having kids- and everything- I just hope they have his old hairline and your old nose. Okay, I know it was a cheap shot, but I feel so much better now.
What? This-this, no, oh no, no-no-no, this is not-that's-that's not what it is. See, see, okay, I work in fashion, see and-and, this is a real dress actually. It's-it's, they're-they're wearing it in Milan, so part of my job is too wear the clothes, and then I see how people respond, and then I report back to my superiors at Bloomingdale's, so... And obviously in uh, in-in this case, I am going to report back, "USA not ready."
I'm funny? Oh thank God! Well hey, I've got a ton of these! Umm, oh hear-Do you want a good one? Here's a good one. Umm, you uh, you take a quarter, take a quarter and, and you blacken the edge. Right? And then you say to person, I bet you can't roll this quarter from your forehead to your chin without it leaving your face. And then when they do it, they're left with a big black pencil line right down the center of their face.
Ross, hi. It's me. I just got back on the plane. And I just feel awful. That is so not how I wanted things to end with us. It's just that I wasn't expecting to see you, and all of a sudden you're there and saying these things... And... And now I'm just sitting here and thinking of all the stuff I should have said, and I didn't. I mean, I didn't even get to tell you that I love you too. Because of course I do. I love you. I love you. I love you. What am I doing? I love you! Oh, I've gotta see you. I've gotta get off this plane.
Phoebe, I'm going to Ross's wedding because he is my ex-boyfriend and that would be really uncomfortable. Not because, I'm still in love with him! I mean, hey, y'know, I like Ross as much as the next guy, y'know? Clearly I have feelings for him, but feelings don't mean love! I mean, I still have loving feelings for Ross. Yeah! But, I have, I have continuing feelings of love, but that doesn't mean that-that I'm still in love with him. Y'know? I-I have sexual feelings for him, but I do love him-Ohh! Oh my God! Oh my-why didn't you tell me?!!
Ya, know what Barr, I'm not gonna leave. I probably should, but I'm not, see 'cause I promised myself that I would make it through at least *one* of your weddings . See now, tonight, all I really wanted was to make it though this evening with a little bit of grace and dignity. Well , I guess we can all agree that's not gonna happen. There's nothing really left to say except.... "Her name was Lola. She was a showgirl. With yellow feathers , feathers in her hair, and a dress cut down to there. She would..."
No. Okay. I was at the airport, getting into a cab, when this woman- this blonde planet with a pocketbook- starts yelling at me. Something about how it was her cab first. And then the next thing I know she just starts- starts pulling me out by my hair! So I'm blowing my attack whistle thingy and three more cabs show up, and as I'm going to get into a cab she tackles me. And I hit my head on the kerb and cut my lip on my whistle...oh...everybody having fun at the party? Are people eating my dip?
You know what, I'm gonna do that, I'm gonna call him up, and I'm gonna ask him out. I can do that. Ask him out. How you doin'? Hi! Joshua? It's Rachel Green from Bloomingdale's. Yeah, umm, I was wondering if you umm, if you umm, left your wallet at the store today? Well, we found a wallet, and we- the license? Well, that is a good idea! Uh, well, let's see here this says this license belongs to a uh, uh, belongs to a mister uh, Pheebs, and umm, yeah, so sorry to bother you at home. I'll see you tomorrow. Bye. You've done that a thousand times?
It's just this thing. Every year we would go out on my dad's boat and watch the fireworks. Mom always hated it because the ocean air made her hair all big. My sister Jill would be throwing up over the side and my dad would be upset becasue nobody was helping and then when we did help he would scream at us for doing it wrong. But then when the fireworks started, everybody just shut up, you know, and it'd get really cold, and we would all just sort of smush under this one blanket. It never occured to anybody to bring another one. And now it's just...
Mom, would you relax. That was 10 blocks from here and, the, the woman was walking alone at night, I would never do that. Mom, c'mon, stop worrying. This is a safe street, this is a safe building, there's nothing OH MY GOOOD, oh my God, oh I gotta go, I gotta go, I gotta go. OK, that's fine, you just read the paper, I'm gonna get a pot, it's not for you. OK, that's fine, read the Family Circus, enjoy the gentle comedy. Aaahh, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, aaaaahh. It's open you guys.
Now, now the one in the feather boa, that's Dr. Francis. Now, she used to be a man. Okay, now look, see, there's Raven. We hate her. We're glad she's dying. Okay- Wh- wh- Marcel, are you playing with Monica's shoes? You know you're not supposed to pl- whoah. Marcel, did you poo in the shoe? Marcel, bad monkey! Oh! Oh! Sorry, Barry. Little engagement gift. I'm sure you didn't register for that. Who died? Who died? Roll him over! Oh, c'mon, roll him over! Oh...! Well, we know it wasn't Dexter, right Marcel? Because- Marcel? Marc-
Oh God... well, it started about a half hour before the wedding. I was in the room where we were keeping all the presents, and I was looking at this gravy boat. This really gorgeous Lamauge gravy boat. When all of a sudden- Sweet 'n' Lo?- I realized that I was more turned on by this gravy boat than by Barry! And then I got really freaked out, and that's when it hit me: how much Barry looks like Mr. Potato Head. Y'know, I mean, I always knew looked familiar, but... Anyway, I just had to get out of there, and I started wondering 'Why am I doing this, and who am I doing this for?'.

I made a huge fool of myself and I came back, that shows courage. When I thought you wanted sex in exchange for this job, I said no. That shows integrity. And, I was not afraid to stand up for myself and that shows courage. Okay umm, now I know I already said courage, but y'know you gotta have courage. And umm, and finally when I thought you were making sexual advances in the workplace, I said no and I was not litigious. {By the way, litigious means to want to litigate and litigate is to make a lawsuit against.
