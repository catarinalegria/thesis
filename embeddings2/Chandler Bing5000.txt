May I help you?
Monica's a little drunk.
Hi, how are ya?

Fine, let's do it.

The hot chicks?

What's the matter Joe?
Oh, the mixed tape.
I can't believe you did this.
What are you doing tonight?

What a sweet story.
Not fun anymore?
No, there were two.
Oh, good job Joe.
Hey! How'd it go?

First of the month.
Okay, hold on. Okay.
Oh my God! Play!
How do you figure that?
Ross, ten o'clock.
You mind if I...

In the game room!
No, I'm alright, thanks.

No!! You can't!!
A face ass?
Dude, you're shaking!
You don't like that show?
All right I'll have one.
Y'know what, pretty good.
Bored and bored!
Humiliating and noble!
That's the perfect amount!
So, what are you gonna do?
What, like a number?
Why is that so funny?
Why can't you tell her?
Yeah so, Tuesday?
Could I be more sorry.
Oh yes! Oh yes!
Oh, this is not that bad.
Why?! What happened?!
Well it's very unsettling.
Wow! You look amazing!
That's a low one!
Yep, pretty much.
I've got good news!
Picturing that tree?
Yeah-yeah, me neither.
That's... That's was...
That would be advice!!
He will, Joe.
Okay. I'll be right there.
Well, we are great guys.
No, Amish boy.
It still doesn't work.
Well, aren't you a treat.
Stop it. Stop it!
That sounds like fun.
So, this isn't over?
What does it say?!
I'll ask. Boohaki?
'S'why I'm dancing...
Fear of Triscuts?
Welcome home man.
Couldn't be more out.
Hello, Chandler Bing.
We can talk about that.
We can't accept this.
Hey, he's not crying.
What else is new?
Yeah! You wanna come?
He has a gun!
Okay, that's enough honey!
Stop making candy!
Oh fresh air!
Really? You're gonna be okay?
H-He's in China!
Do you want a calculator?
Honey, it's gonna be okay.
Oh, DAMN IT!
Oh, my, god!
See? Here we go.
Well, what did she say?
I'm free! I'm free!
You okay there man?
That's-that's my nubbin.
No thanks, Josephine.
No thanks, Mom!
You do? That's fantastic!
I'll tell you at the wedding.
You know, you think I would.
That's what I was doing too.
Ross, it's just a sandwich!
I spelled out boobies.
Good morning, everybody.
Okay, good-bye. Good-bye.
I don't think you can do that!
I can't believe she's married.
No you know I don't mind.
Hey Phoebe! Fatty!
Totally worth it!
Hey-hey, is Monica here?
Have you seen Joey?
That was... Impressive.
Congratulations!/Good for you!/Great!
I'm not supposed to tell you.
Well, this is much better.
There's a Mr. Bing!
Nice work my friend.
I think I should get the chair!
I mean, I was sitting there.
Aww, I love you so...
So, where's Mike?
You need new clothes.
Oh yeah? Well thanks.
Is that a real thing?
I wanna quit the gym.
Ah. Chandler Bing.
Stick to your side!
Haha, no thanks!
You still want that baby?
Oh, it's okay. I don't...
We didn't play it!!
Yeah, I'm not so worried.
In a bad way?
You didn't just break up.
I'm not Jewish, so...
But, those are for you.
Alright, here's ten.
...The second guy.
Oh, what's at 8:00?
Thank you! Thank you!
Oh, I don't know, a million?
So you don't have the cameras?!
Um, is it sugarless?
On every word?
It happened in London.
Yes. Right where?
Well this one's for you.
I'm here to see Mary-Angela.
What about the time difference?
Okay, I gotta go to work.
We're moving to Tulsa!
Right. So, I'm sorry...
What gave me away?
This is not going to work.
She's not gonna say no.
Okay, then get the lobster!
Well this is just sad!
And you're okay with that?
Really? I don't like baths.
Hi Joey's sisters!
How far outside?
You gotta do it, man.
Are you really that busy?
It's a sock bunny.
Sex on the balcony?
Courtside? Oh my God.
You really want to take me?
And twenty-five it is.
Yeah, I'm cool. Casual.
Your cappucino sir.
I'll...I'll get you later!
Mine was a humdinger.
Is it really that bad?
Well, thank you for lunch.
Hi! How'd it go?
Hey-hey are you drunk?
See, honey, there's-
Oh, seriously you want him?
Another hard 8.
So it did go well.
Well, I'm going to kill you.
Wait, we can't do this.
Why would I be mad?
Oh, what the hell is that?
Hey, what was that all about?
Yeah, didn't he tell ya?
Here's another plan...No!
We're taking a break!
Coffee in a fight!
And to you too, Helen.
Okay, so Richard, Richard!
I made that joke up.
Hey, this is so unfair!
He saw a therapist?
Well yeah, but then...
All right. Very good.
Yeah, check out the ring.
Uhh, no-no thanks.
Oh, I think I have the cash.
Oh yeah man. Joey.
What am I gonna do now?
Why did I get married?!
We have heard you play.
And your friend Phoebe?
Can we start over?
You mean like, music?
Look, are you gonna be ok?
Why did you get me this?
Hi, Paul, is it?
What equity investments?
This vacation sucks!!
Y'know, whipped! Wah-pah!
Where you going, Joe?
Phoebe knows about us!
Yeah, let's just forget it.
Okay, Ross is in the bathroom.
Did you know this about him?
And a date with a man!
Oh-oh, what are you doing?
I'm not arguing with that.
Lose the other guys.
Did I not mention that?
Yes, but for the last time.
Rachel, wait, wait.
Joey, no means no!
So what does this mean?
Yeah, he came up...
Forget it, that's off.
So, you busy Thursday?
Yeah, Ross is here so...
Because that would be crazy?
Happy New Year!
Hey! How's the boat?!
I'm the ruptured spleen.
Oh, do you not want to?
That is a bad interview.
What is the matter with you?
Not it! Damn it!
Who are those people?
Hi, oh hi.
So, what're you gonna do?
Oh, I couldn't be happier.
I also said, "Yes!"
Today is the sixth.
Joey's a sex addict.
That's patio furniture!
All right, let me in.
Totally crazy stupid.
Come on guys, PUSH!
To see her pants?
I can't believe you came back.
Hello! Little ones.
Do you know what just happened?
I know, what are we gonna do?
Because it's too delicious.
Ohh, that's a good one.
I can check that for ya.
Ahh, third base.
Your sister Ursula.
What's the matter honey?
Unfortunately that is correct.
No reason, except...she...told...me.
He really is a chameleon.
Nope, not under here!
See you later Mon.
I'm going to the bathroom now.
Seriously, answer faster!
You are really frightening me.
Do you want me to call?
That's what I did. Wah-pah!
PUSH! PUSH! PUSH!
What's up with the simian?
Oh, great. This is just...
Of course it was!
Did she look 16?
Ah that's a cantelope.
When'd you meet her?
Ooh, you almost had it.
The comedian? USO?!
You're welcome, sweetheart.
Wait, you guys, look!
I'm sorry, I won't be here.
Are you, are you high?
Uhh. You are welcome.
OK, let's do it. What?
Me? No. You?
She? It's a girl?
Oh yeah, that looks good.
An old cookie?
Does anybody know me?!
Okay, one thing at a time.
So are we...friends again?
Ooh! That's my girl!
How do you feel about that?
Okay, so he's out of here.
'Cause I was sitting there.
I'll cancel the sodas.
What is wrong with Emma?
Yeah, all right, I'll play.
We already knew that!
Staying out of the way.
Well, I feel like a snack!
It's me. I'm the other guy.
I can't believe I ruined this.
Let's have Monica decide.
Let me try it on!
I haven't seen this dress.
What are you doing out there?
Bullies, big bullies.
They'll never understand!
A vending machine?
Hey! What are you guys doing?
Actually, I don't like martinis.
Really? Male nurses?
And last but not least.
Wait, wait, wait.
Yes, it's also 2003.
Work on your music?
Your tax dollars?
I don't... uh... understand.
We could trade later.
Oh uh, o, OK.
God that is good TV.
It's an old key!
Oh, okay, time's up!
We're very happy for you.
Hey. Where've you been?
Is it made of cheese?
So, uh, how was he?
Okay, what do you guys think?
I think it just fell off.
Hi honey I'm home.
Oh, you'll see my friend.

Was that another question?
Lick away my man.

We are on our honeymoon.
Whoa! Don't know about that.
He's the boss's son.
My lighter's in there!
Well.... it is amouz-ing...
No, I let him win-Ross!
I can't believe we're doing this.
It's the Miracle Wax.
My duties? All right.
They put you in jail?
I think you should take the job.

Because, I'm too afraid.
Football? Just football?
Oh no! No! No! No!
There's nobody here Joe.
So, you don't think I'm terminal?
He's Greek Orthodox.
I can't believe we live here!
It's not charity, Joe...
But we don't know the neighbors.
Alright. Yes, this is Rachel.
Isn't she cute? No!
Seriously, we're gonna do this?
Do I still call you Ross?
You slept with the stripper?
Why? What happened to him?
Excellent hole, Joe.
What?! Why did you do that?
Oh, this is soo bad.
I - I don't think I can.
Could you want her more?
Yeah, we got, um-hmm.
Well maybe he was nervous.
You just thought of that in there?
Okay, come here! Come here.
It's okay, I got a plan.
I can't remember which sister.
OK, Pheebs, your turn.
Hmmm, that's very cool.
I said art lover.
Well, either that or uh...
Oh, are we playing this?!
That's not a state Joe.
I know, this is a great apartment.
What are you guys talking about?
No, really you're gonna freeze.
Okay, on three. One....Two....
I'll give up my ticket.
Marriage advice? Really?!
I got a maid. Yay!
It's Clint. It's Clint!
He's at a dinner party.
Actually it's both of us.
So that's the girl you like.
Oh, y'know, y'know what Pheebs?
Oh-ho-ho, I don't think so!
Isn't that Ross's money?
Let's do it, come on!
Hi honey I'm home!

Your thoughts? Plural?
Ben! Ben! Ben!
Water! Water! Water!
Oh, she's goin' somewhere.
Oh yeah! With who?
At a fake game!!

What, what's what you mean?
Hello, Joanna......'s office.

What is so funny about that?
Happy birthday! I'm sorry.
You guys wanna eat here?
You don't even have a car!
Hey! Happy birthday ...
Happy birthday, pal!
Monica. Calm, self.
Uh, if you say so sir.
Oh yeah, I totally agree.
I know what she's talking about.
A little late for that.
Now, there's two reasons.
You, you are gonna love this.
No, no, you don't have to see.
Y'know, I don't see that happening?
Not if I kiss you first.
Should we call the spitter?
Oh, will you give me the thing.
Yeah, for about 30 minutes.
That's a good call. Right.
Boys? We're going in.
New York is awesome!
Hey, what you guys talking about?
Yeah, let's celebrate life!
Well, I have a call in about that.
Well, we could count again.
Y'know, you'd think I would've.
Oh no-no, I can't do that.
Isn't Ben in this?
Well the duck can swim.
I don't care! I don't care!!
She has a real name.
Hey, Rach, can I get...
Sounds like a date to me.
Tell it again. Seriously.
Somebody is gonna pick us.
Is that your new walk?
And that doesn't scare you?
What did I marry into?
Joey you broke my chair!!
Her name is Erica.
This took you all day?!
Phoebe is, making people.
The man's got a point.
OK, Phoebs, your turn.
Oh, what a crappy night!
I am, I'm ignoring you.
Oh, oh, c'mon in.
Yeah, we really missed you guys.
Ok, this could be tough.
Okay, who wore those?
I-kea! This is comfortable.
I'll catch you guys later.
I wouldn't know, I didn't make it!
So-You got in voluntarily?!
We've got to do something!
So, a professor, uh?
And that's how you bought it?
I'm not gonna mess it up.
But you're still my friend?
Hey, y'know what? I was wrong.
Yeah, yeah right over there.
Yeah, I'll take care of it.
How about Joey... Pepponi?
Althea?! What are you doing?!

I know, it's beautiful. Amazing.
Hey! Hey, hey-hey, hey.
Oh o-, OK man.
So who's gonna tell them?
Hey guys, what are you doing?
...And what did you bring?
I don't have travel insurance.
But I think we should tell her.
Your boyfriend is so cool.
Take off your shirt!
Ah! Ahh!! Ahh!!
I said it first, bro.
I can't believe it! We're here!
Ok, you can not do this to me.
How do you know that? How?
Hey Joe what's up?
Yeah, I know that means buddy!
Don't play with his things.
Ok, how about this ?
Takin' that with you, huh?
I never stopped loving you.
Oh, how well you know me...
Oh, you must stop shooping.
Yes, money well spent!
That's what they'll call us.
That, that's what's stupid.
What?! What are you talking about?
What stupid thing did you do?
Yes! Ross, you have to stay!
And, a lemon lime.
This game is kinda fun.
Yes have you seen any?
What about that circled one?
I mean, you have a lovely home.
Can you people not see me?!
No, not us... Us!
You can't move at all?
Can I finish my story?!
He thought you said gonad.
I'm not getting into this again!
That was there when I got here.
I paid for those tickets!
Those are all really old!
Fine! Maybe I will too!
Oh, right, right, shut up.
I'm sorry, did you say cheese?
I want you to say that you like her!
Hi! Nice to meet you!
Because I'm gonna play for ya.
You're right, this is more fun.
Did she go out with him?
Okay, bye! Oh my God!!
Sounds like a fun party.
I said, "Like what?"
Don't worry about it Pheebs.
No not Candy Lady.
Is there a puppy here?
Oh, good. Rog is here.
You're naked in this picture!
Yes, this, this was pleasant.
It's like a giant hug.
She's just doing her job!
Well, how you died was funny.
There we go little fella.
Dude that is so sad.
What if Joey were president?
Why haven't you told them?!
What are you guys doing together?
It was a car backfire!
Well that's a full cup!
You don't know. You didn't see it.
So, is Janine around?
Oh that's not bad, Pheebs?
Is anybody else scared?
By drowning or...?!
Oh, uh, listen, about tonight...
Okay. I wanna quit the gym.
I married Fred Sanford!
Oh they didn't want to come!
You can't make this stuff up!
Pheebs! Always a pleasure.
Man, I gotta get a kid.

It's exactly like it sounds.
That's perfect! That's brilliant!
OH MY GOD!!!
Pie eating contest?
Do you know what I was thinkin'?
Okay, we owe you a present.
Because I'm in love with Monica!!
She picked those out too.

I never want to leave you again!
No! Her boyfriend Richard!
Have fun at church-camp!
You are so great! I love you!

Oh come on you big faker!
And the world will never know.

But, I never left the room!
Hey, that's...'joincidence' with a 'C'!
Well you proved them wrong.
Dude, don't do that too me!
Hey! How'd the audition go?

Okay, I promise, I'll end it.
Hey, big guy, game time.
Okay, what is in here? Rocks?
No-no-no-no! That was the joke!
Sorry about the table, man.
You had a bachelorette party?!
The wife says "Hi!".
What the hell is going on?!
You can't just call Monica's room.
Whoa, snowing out there?
Why wouldn't they be happy?
You hear that? We're the guys.
Yeah, it's annoying, isn't it?
Uh, could you leave me one?
You gonna buy a new one?
Which is why you should do it.
I can't seem to say goodbye.
Joey! Joey! Joey! J-J-Joey-Joey-J-Joey!
Yes that was a nice place!
Y'know uh, I didn't actually do this.
Where's my seat belt?
I'm sure you're right, but why?
Joey, wait! The ball!
Yeah, and I don't have any cologne.
Yeah, never cheat on Rachel.
Okay, here is the phone bill.
I didn't know Monica had these!
So you're really okay with this?
And the fireplace in the bedroom.
Yeah, right, yeah, I guess so.
Yeah, but I bet it works.
Oh my God, introduce us!
Oh my God, what's up?!
Oh, so that's what this is for.
Oh no, you'll have to come.
No! No! Not, Paris.
She was not good. Not good.
You know that's not the reason Joe.
You're flingin'-flangin' right I am!
So whaddya got there Monica?
I always liked you, Ken.
What are you guys doing out here?
Okay, excuse me for a minute.
How do Monica and Phoebe know?
Uh, yes, yes it is.
I'm not breaking up with her!
What've you been up to?
Two hours, that lasted!
Okay, so when do you want to go?
How was your date with Joey?
Really? Like you have a routine?
Glass, sand, whatever.
Game's tomorrow night Joe.
I'm gettin' my chair back!
There you go! There you are!
Doctor Connelly just called.
Ahhhh-I'm not going to call you.
Well, those were seals, man.
No, did he hug you?!
It was a "Wendy's!! "
Well then maybe you shouldn't go.
I was not ready for this today!
It's yelling...bleeding...dilating. Oh, the dilating...
Alright, we're gettin' closer.
Right. So how're you doing?
There has got to be a way!
I can't believe the guys missed this.
What... did you get me there?
I know! You ready to trade?
Well, you-you know what I meant.
They're never coming down now.
You're not gonna need my help?
I was shrieking... like a Marine.
Ooh, let me talk to him!
And this- is my reward!
Wow! Look at them run.
Well, so why not go knock?
There's a Phoebe on my sandwich!
But you said you were ready too.
Whoa-whoa-whoa! We're having kids?!
Why are you wearing my apron?
Uhhuh, how did you know that?
Ooh! Calm down ...
He started mine first!
Oh yeah, there-there she is!
Well, what did the police say?
I'm gonna put on some music.
Stay out of my freezer!
That is the exact same thing.
So, you and Rachel tonight, huh?
Well then why can't I see it?
And then Joey remembered something.
Well, only if you order stuff.
When have I ever done that?!
I know, but just let me say it.
Can I sleep on your couch?
Here we go, here we go.
Oh, good, Joey's home now.
But then later that night...
You said that to me last week.
You know, I think I might just.
Hey, woah, hey, woah.
I think so. Yeah, get off me.
Do you have my credit card?
Love your condoms my man.
Just act like you belong.
No, actually Laurie's a boy.
You did look like an idiot.
Our guy smells incredible.
Well, maybe you don't marry this one.
Okay! You don't think I thought of that?
Oh! Oh! That's so hard.
"Happy Birthday Peehe."
Kori? Kori Weston?
Mm! Night Gar'!
Sydney Portier? Hehheh.
Janice is gonna go away now.
Kinda. They're really big.
We don't need to remedy that.
You left a shoe here?!
Well, you...don't look good Joe.
I'm not even... I'm not even...
oh yes, God yes!!
Nope! I can do this all day.
We're teeth people Zack!
There are seven?! That's one?
Bye. Are you still out there?
I know. He has your eyes.
As crazy as soccer?
And the Knicks rule all.
I do NOT want this unit!!
But are you sure you can do this?
Sure. Ummm. What's up?
I'm not going to let you say anything.
I'm sorry, I got a little occupied.
I thought I had to make the jokes!
Yeah.... she's not so cute.
Hmm, the game's at one.
I don't know... um, Grease?
That was pretty intense huh?
Hello! One marriage please!
I didn't know you had another level.
That new mountain bike?
Now this feels like Thanksgiving.
It's gonna be ok. You know that?
The one time they're not home.
When did that happen to you?!
What is the matter with you ?!?
Yeah, I heard you and Rachel talking.
Hey, Kicky. What're you doing?
Wow! Just like in the pros.
Op, op, I'm convinced!
Stop talkin' to your men.
Seriously, where did this happen?
Yeah, I just got uh, got plans.
mmm That's enough about you!
...and then it got canceled.
You went home with the waitress.
Paid your phone bill?
Oh, that's-that's okay, no problem.
Can you figure out what I'm doing?
Oh, well thank you in advance.
Well then maybe you should take it.
Might wanna try Joseph.
Bye. I can't stand the woman!
Well it's not Sean Penn.
They got a breakfast buffet.
And no kissing your neck.
How about those three pointers?
Your work makes me sad.
So you didn't mean any of that?!
But I love swing music!
Nothing, I just like to go like this.
Joey, I saw you push him!
Joey was in a porno movie.
I quit and you learn what I do?
I'd love it if you would do it.
If I see him, I'll ask.
I did pay for half of it.
There's a hair in my coffee.
Ross' shirt is torn.
Yes, you can pass for 19.
Oh, well... Maybe we could...
No! No! No! I can't do that!
Oh, okay. Send her in.
Well, that makes me feel so good.
Yes, but I-I uh, don't have too.
Wow, he looks so normal.
Really? What changed your mind?
How did the job stuff go?
You totally screwed him over.
Shh! Nice to see you again.
Oh, I got some thoughts on that.
Okay, the old hug and roll.
Hey, you said that without gagging!
Hey! Did you have the baby yet?
No. How are ya Paul?
Can I give you a present now?
Well no, Charlie's gonna get that.
I'd like a Google Card.
What does yours say Pheebs?
There's no back to this couch!
I'll get you the Cliff Notes.
Well, that's what we said about Joey...
No, we only went out once.
So what job did you get Joe?
I got the time to get to know Julie.
Ah! The high road...
See, I told you they don't swim.
I'm gonna ask Monica to marry me.
Okay, you ready for the last picture?
Y'know what? I-I kinda have.
They're in my bag over there.
Okay, let's play my game now.
All right buddy, way to go!
Yeah, you almost overreacted to something.
7:15. Watch doesn't work.
Thanks Joey, that's a good idea.
All right, call it in the air.
Wow that's actually pretty cool.
I love you, St. Valentine.
It's alright. Is she good-looking?
Why am I hearing cheering?
Why are you screaming and hugging?
Well, it still has to go, right?
You mean you didn't get it from this?
I love you. And I know about the baby.
Lets not do that any more.
You know how to use a compass?
Oh no nonononononnononono, don't go..
Well, she... she didn't win...
No! We're not borrowing money.
Ooh, oh, oh, that's her.
Yes, we're standing out ground...apparently.
Kill me. Kill me now.
Okay, but now see you're crying!
And he's not speaking metaphorically.
Well, she wasn't sleeping with him.
Please tell me you got the message!
This game makes no sense!
Ha! I'm just messing with you.
Ooh, I do! I do! I do!
That's what our friends call us.
Your last roommate's kidney?
All right, maybe I should call her.
Who said anything about Christmas?
Hey Mon, how's it going?
Yeah! All right! You go first.
I don't know. Should we try it?
I wasn't staring. I was leering.
This is the best game ever!!!
Oh, but it's not 'til tomorrow!
I'll look forward to your call.
How did you? How? How?
Did it turn into sand?
Well, maybe it was God, doing me.
What we did last night was....
My friend's name is Joey.
Wow umm, calm down.
So uhh, how's the palace?
Y'know Richard...you are a good guy.
Well, did-did you correct him?
It's a kitchen slash bathroom.
Neat. I'm gonna die alone.
...That's it. I'm getting cigarettes.
Man, didn't she like just get here?
What do we use to split it?
And I think Ross is generous too.
We're flipping Monica's mattress.
That's great. Can I see the book?
Did you do it on our invitations?!
Okay, but if you can't...no dinner!
Joey's tailor...took advantage of me.
There you go! Someone came!
...Take off their hats!
Do either of you have the keys?
The man is showing brain.
Yeah, it's a very large plane.
What in God's name is that?!
Can you ever feel your ears?
What are you crazy? That's a baby!
Huh-huh! You can't give her that.
Our guy has great hair.
I didn't know it was a big secret.
Why don't you open with a joke?
Man, that's some bad advice!
What do we do? What do we do?
And I just want a million dollars!
There's a forest right outside.
Too bad, she's leaving.
Oh, I just wanted to say, "Hey!"
I don't know, five hundred dollars?
Guys guys, check this out.
Now you do that, you're on TV.
You kissed her that night too?
How is that ever going to happen?!
Yes, and we're very excited about it.
Joey, what-wh-wh-wha-wh-wha-wh-wha-wh-wha-what are you doing here?
Still on Amelia Earhart?
Step away from the duck.
Oh yea yea, absolutely.
More so than anything else.
I am strong! I'll show you!
Ok, they're coming, shhh.
Here we go! Here we go!
He's taking off her coat!
I know. Gooooood luck with it.
Oh, she's sorry! I feel better!
No one was around to hear that?
Yeah well, I'm gonna go spit.
But, we'll stay here with you.
Oh no, you see, actually it is.
What?! I'm Chandler! Oh, that's Richard!
Really? Right across the street?
L-leaving my troubles behind?
Hey! Remember when I had corneas?
Hey, whoa-whoa! What's she like?
Well, why can't you do them tomorrow?
Excuse me. How ya doin'?
Yeah, you-you gotta love the talking.
Yes, every single one of them.
I'm a little busy here Paul.
Are those my wife's nipples?
So uh, which one is mine?
But the Kit-Kats are all right?!
I-never borrowed your Walkman.
No, no he went for a walk.
Where are Bill and Colleen?
Man, I'm so lucky I have Monica.
Just a little bit of sugar.
Mrs. Braverman must be out.
I have *not* thought this through!
I don't think the flash went off.
I can't figure out what to make Monica.
Rachel... with handcuffs! Interesting!
So you uh, want to do something tonight?
Fears and Pet Peeves.
Well you did pull his hair.
We're notwe're not saying anything.
Hit yourself in the tooth?
Oh, I can uh, check that for ya.
How long have we been home?
Wherever! I've got like 20!
No! No! No! I just kissed her.
How do you know so much about this?
Yes...Yes..Uh-huh, You? We did you.
I cannot believe you didn't pick me.
Joey, can I talk to you for a second?
Well we...we still hang out.
Rach, Rach, knock knock.
I think we've found our sperm!
Yeah, why not. So I told her.
Oh my God, how did you do that?
I don't see him. Do you see him?
Did somebody sign your bra?
You want me to wear your panties?
Have you talked to him lately?
I know, I still am one of these.
I happen to know a Fun Bob.
Because the kids need new shoes.
Oh, I'll go out and get you some.
You, touching yourself, out!
You wanna see if we still have it?
Wow! Aren't you gonna be cold?
I'm going to need a bigger boat.
It's your mommy. It's your mommy.
Rachel, could I see you for a moment?
Well it's not flexed right now!
I'm in college and I'm in a band.
Well, what if all my stuff was here?
Hey! So are you enjoying the bike?
Do you remember talking to me yesterday?
Rach, Rach, we gotta settle.
Okay, so this time I won't quit!
We have free porn here!!!
Here it is! Here it is!
Hey, look, what do you want from me?
Yes, 98.6. You're gonna be fine.
Oh yeah, I should probably call them.

Oh yeah, it's actually in my bedroom.
Actually, uh, we're both the father.
Y'know I think we should invite them.
And, we're done with the yogurt.
Okay, so you both just know this stuff?
Turns out he is kinda funny.
Y'know, I've had dates like this.
Ehh, you're just liquored up.
He didn't say anything about that to me.
I'm not fine. Here she comes.
Yeah let's head off to work.
...little playthings with yarn?
Joe. Joe! Answer the phone.
Okay, you guys uh, you guys pick first
So where are you applying to?
That really was an incredible wedding.
You do realise that's your brother?
Have you ever been with a woman?
Do we have to make the entire thing?
You still can't stand her can you?
It's like this, me, no jokes.
Okay, well tonight's the big night.
No! No! No! I was so careful!
Yeah? You don't think it's just pathetic?
Hey, come on, it's not your fault.
I'm an alien. I'm an alien.
No, he's right, I'm totally lying.
Yeah. Is that a dinosaur tie?
Yeah, I guess it's a little better now.
Would you please get some rest!
I'm telling you, I watched the tape.
Well, you do want all that stuff, right?
Oh! She's growing inside you.
Yeah but you don't need--What is this?
Hey, you have got to try this cheesecake.
That's funny, I saw no phlegm.
That's what we were gonna name the baby.
She's cheating on Joey with Ross!
We have to get out of here, baby!
Look out kids, he's coming!
Oh, I'm sorry, so 'we' is?
Your family name is Tribbiani.
Of course it is. Wow-whoa!
The food there was, was great.
Mom. Thanks for wearing something.
For an emergency just like this.
I need to talk to you, it's urgent!
Yeah, I think we should see other people.
You are a frightening, frightening man.
The Hard Rock Caf?
We don't have to come up with this now.
Oh, don't worry, we'll find them.
Soo... you girls having fun?
Oh. Oh, did-did-did I wake you?

You look beautiful. Is this new?
Would you like to have dinner sometime?
Yes, include more people in this.
Apology accepted. Excuse us.
Oh look, it's the woman we ordered.
That's easy, baggage claim.
Well you don't have to sound so surprised.
Whoa-ho, back off, Missy!
I hope she throws up on you.
Oh, tell her good luck with that.
So, uh, you met someone, huh?
Well, we're-we're hanging out in here!
Okay, okay. So, should I call her?
Well, actually just one birthday flan.
Huh? Where, whaddya mean?
Last time I do that, I promise.
Hey, so can you make it on Friday?
Yeah, we're gonna need to see that tape.
Yeah, I know. She makes me happy.
And now you're giving me the message!
Well, where's the logic in that?!
Weird world. Your kids?
You really think that is what he meant?
I found a dried up seashores.
Believe me, sometimes that happens.
Well I'm not showing you my 'tat.'
Sure, everybody loves a kidder.
This is the New York Times.
So, you feel like a dad yet?
No, we'd just like to close them.
Hey that's what I tell girls about me.
Do I smell essential oils?
Are you trying to get everybody divorced?
Wait! You're going out with Kathy!
And condoms are the way to do that?
Oh, well give me the phone then.
Well I like both eggs equally.
That was like 5 years ago.
Oh, we're gonna flip for the baby?
You can't leave! I have your shoe!
Woah, woah, that's not pretty!
See now it feels like Christmas!
But we're not ready to tell yet!
He just said, "No strippers."
Yeah! Totally! Totally, and you?
But I don't wanna do it in a cup!
Alright I feel youger already!
Okay, how'd it go at the doctor's?
Okay, 'cause that's not gonna get annoying.
Is this because of the burrito thing?
Nancy Thompson's getting fired!
I'm not going to Vermont with this Monica!
Yeah, why don't we lose the gloves.
Oh totally! Pull my finger.
And that's... how... it's done!
Was that Emma? Is she up?
Did that movie ever get made?
You can't leave me alone with her.
Hello? Is someone on the line?
Uhh... Yeah sure. Click!
They got a phone in there, right?
And yet you're surprisingly upbeat.
Okay, I don't think we can turn anymore!
The whole thing! Can we go?
I used to have that bumper sticker.
See? They're Joey's! J-J-J-J-J-Joey's!
Joey, why is your cable out?
You don't think I get up when you get up?
You mean like for award shows?
Oh it's uh, over there on the table.
Yes because uh, you look so young.
Well maybe it was all of your questions.
Why would our guy be a weirdo?
Wouldn't that be Frank the III?
So, uh, wh-where ya from?
Something else I might have said?
We really...didn't get a chance to...
And there's not chance that will work?
When did I try to give you money?
And uh, Rachel, glad to have you back.
Whoa-whoa-whoa! You broke Joey's chair?
Some guy, Tom Gordon.
You're not a dad. You're not a dad.
All right, I'm off to see your dad.
NO! No, I'll take that for ya.
More coffee over here, please!
Okay, yeah, I think it's really stuck now.
Oh so there can't be any yelling.
So then I guess Ferdinad is out.
Was that place... The Sun?
In a foreign, romantic country...
Are you actually saying these words?
It means we're holding hands.
No, I wasn't gonna ask you that, no.
Diagnostician or boo-boo fixer?
Not even on page 7?
Interesting! Can I see you for a second?
Look, we can't stay in here forever.
I wouldn't read too much into it.
I'm never gonna find a roommate, ever.
Higher or lower than what?
Monica, can I talk to you for a sec?
That's very funny. We done now?
OK, so now we draw cards.
Yeah. Thanks for making me do this.
No, I just had to get a picture of this.
Richard was there so I couldn't do it!
And now I've picked it up again.
Oh suddenly, flowers are feminine?
I will have the uh, Cajun catfish.
I stole Monica's and changed the name.
Well, Kathy's last boyfriend was Joey.
So it's pretty much the same Pheebs.
Yes talk to her. Be a man.
Oooh-hoo, very attractive, forgiving.
She's okay with Rachel and the baby?
I'm sorry, I guess I just like the pulp.
I'm not lying to you, I watched it!
I got something for her. It's a book!
Your sister Joan is crazy.
Fine, I'll give the suit back.
I'm kidding. This is going to be fun.
Okay, I'm going to go stand over there.
Next time, can I say breathe?
Yeah umm, they're called wallets.
Yeah. We're doing the right thing, right?
Dude, it's Chandler. Let me in.
Oh, ok, 'cause we never do that.
David is going to propose to Phoebe.
Uh why, do you have a lecture?
Yeah, well. It's the right thing to do.
Fowl? No. Women? Nooo.
And you're gonna make them all disappear.
Oh what's the matter? Are you scared?
We were playing poker, alright...
So, basically just a Chinese guy.
That's so cool. I'll let Monica know.
Happy Anniversary, 10 months!
Okay Ross, why don't you come with me?
Well now-now you're just talking crazy.
I didn't know Ross and you were so close.
Oh, yeah! How did you meet her?
What happened? I'm just eating candy.
Listen, I'm really glad you got the part.
Ooh, I don't know if we're there yet.
Hey. Hold on a second. Huh?
'Cause, I wanted to uh, give you this.
In the James Taylor case.
Is he the one with the beautiful wife?
Nina? Nina. Nina. Nina.
Yeah, I wouldn't know having missed everything.
You think we're ready for something like that?
Do you want me to be afraid of you?
How about the closet by the bathroom?
Eh, somebody's in a good mood!
You're it! Now run and hide!
You do know that Wham broke up?
Feelings, such strong feelings.
Hi. Anybody know a good tailor?
Well, you owe me one, big guy.
Yeah, I've always hated that Howie.
I said, "Geez, relax Monnnnn."
One of the slots got filled.
Batman has a utility belt!
Kick save and... denied.
Oh, I don't think I ever heard that story.
Yeah, well, I don't dance at weddings.
A hundred and forty-five pounds.
I'm smoking. I'm smoking, I'm smoking.
Ok, look! Enough is enough!
Y'know Pheebs, it's kinda our anniversary.
Did you tell her what we talked about?
All right! Bring it on, you...
It's not gonna be exactly like last time.
Where did you hear it from before?
Ya know, the man's got a point.
Shh! It is a family name!
Umm, how's it going with you guys?
Not to mention the cold sores.
How do you not fall down more?
So I'm not, not gonna lose her?
Ross, that was 16 years ago!
Well that would help the pride thing.
I've been taking dancing lessons.
Ah sure. What's in 'em?
The Hitlers will be so disappointed.
Have I got the 50 guys for you!
Are you hugging the door right now.
Ho-ho, you win! 50 dollars!
Hey, how's the first day goin'?
No, the baby's out! Look, look!
Gee, Monica, what's in the bag?
But what did he mean by rules?
That's so funny, because I think I just did!
I just wanted to show Monica your book.
No, the little girl creeps me out.
Sorry! I-I-I don't know what to say.
Yes that would have made more sense.
Look it was a lo-o-ong time ago.
Then you're gonna have to watch it for me.
Oh, tons, I'm quite the woodsman.
Yeah, right here in my pocket. Pheebs?
Well, I ended up telling her everything.
I say we go with Careless Whisper.
Work people? Nobody told me.
What about things that are already gold?
Thank you Helen, that'll be all.
Okay. Joey, trade lives with me!
Oh, man. I'm sorry, I'm so-so sorry.
Come on, let me see that smile.
So we both finished our vows.
First I was afraid, I was petrified.
let ME be a part of this!
Okay, y'know your not though. Let's go.
Then I got all needy and clingy.
Those aren't eleven and a half.
Might wanna open with the snowman.
But I do know that it's some time tomorrow.
Thanks, I'm glad you see it that way.
Did you like me when we first met?
Love what you've done with the place.
Oh God. It's shovely-Joe, isn't it?
What, what are you laughing at?
Where are they? Where are they?
Will you excuse me I have to um.....
Yes I did, and I think you should do it.
You built a fort didn't ya?
Because he was looking at her differently.
You guys ready fore the movies?
Yes, and I was saying the actual words.
...Come on! Why are we here?!
What did you do when they found out?
It's a nickname, I'll explain later.
Alright, now try taking a puff.
Well maybe you don't have to tell him anything.
Could we be more white trash?
Well, you're forgetting about the time difference.
We really need to take those tests?
The key's stuck in the lock.
I can see why that's hard to resist.
Well where... Where did she go?
So, uh, how often can you do it?
Did you not hear me say, "Du-ude?!"
Who cares? It's a stupid game.
We have to assign heads to something.
I'm just going to wait for a little while.
Should I tell her I ordered tea?
I can't believe you got us into trouble.
Oh, sure, they love us over there.
There's another carton right over there.
Oh, no, no. I just meant hypothetically.
I'm sorry, are you just used to saying that?
Oh. You mind if I join you?
He had sex with Mr. Girabaldi!
No-no-no-no-no-no-no, you are not getting me this way.
I thought you were gonna be gone all day.
So I really never get to win anymore?
They said it could be up to a year.
Had the money in the wrong hand.
What are the odds? What are the odds?
That means nothing to me. Come on!
Do you think he'll ever forgive me?
Eh. I thought that was an alp.
Oh, y'know I-I can't hear that enough.
And Milton Berle has a...
Maybe we'll have to listen and see!
What's the second part of your plan?
I did. But it came at a price.
Y'know, we haven't found anybody else.
Phoebe, I asked you to guard the ring!
ahem... um... Crystal duck.
Are you aware that you're still talking?
Because of the weekend, we had a fight.
So I guess it's just uh, you and me then.
So you don't think I have a, a quality?
Oh I'm sorry! Do you need a break?
Eddie, I didn't sleep with your ex-girlfriend.
OK, then, eat me, I'm done.
Oh, so you're going with the teacher, huh?
Me asking is kind of a sign.
Wait a minute, I can't give this to her.
Richard used to do it, didn't he?
Ross came in forth and cried!
More importantly, was I any good?
Yeah, well, she's probably talking to Richard.
Awesome, the name really stands out.
I am so, so, so, so sorry!
Her ankle is what you're watching?
Alright, what have we learned so far?
Well, your kind of sitting in my seat.
Why to save your dignity my man.
I'm leaning. This is where I lean.
Yeah, but I'm, I'm so much faster...
But if we win, we get your apartment.
We're on a semi-first name basis.
Thank you. I got a job in advertising.
You mean there's more than one of us.
Well Monica just told me that they don't.
I told you I should not wear this color.
Oh my God! Who's gonna watch that?!
Phoebe, are you having a heart attack?!
Oh great, food with hair on it.
Sounds like a really bad idea to me.
Oh, uh, when-when are you coming back?
Oh yeah? Well, how'd she take it?
Yeah all right. Okay, good night guys.
Maybe you do that next time you get married!
It's Paris, who knows we're here!
Great job with the cups, Pheebs!
OK, so at this point, the dealer...
Yes, Bravo on the hot nanny.
That's where people make number two!!
Phoebe, it's me. You can tell me anything.
I would really love it if could do both.
Yeah, so, what's that supposed to mean?!
Bullwinkle socks. That's so sweet.
Bye..... ridiculously dull Bobby.
Wait the uh, the kiss or the situation?
Because it's Sunday. It's God's day.
Hey, my Father's house does that!
There is not one hair on that head.
Why?! Why do I have to tell him?!
I don't know. But I-I-I know I love you!
Oh come on! Are you listening to this?
Yeah. Yeah, I mean what, what would we do?
You're not even giving them a chance!
You got it. You got Nevada twice.
I'd carry you around in my pocket.
Okay. I can't believe tomorrow's the big day.
Really? In front of all this people?
Wh-How did you lose at Cups?!
Look guys, I know it's a little steep.
Some of these look a little frayed.
Sorry, my my thing was in there with me.
Can you believe how lame this is?
Hey, how was your breakfast with Hillary?
Air hole! Air hole!!
What? What did you take a picture of?
So you know this leaves us with...
Guys, guys, guess who I am?!
What's an identical hand twin?
Hello? Hey Charlie, what do you know?
I can't believe she can out run you man!
Hey, there he is! There he is!
Okay. 1...2...3-Go! I'm gonna kill myself!
Okay uh, here's the electric bill.
Excuse me, you guys are getting tattoos?
Could you get us a couple of beers?
So, you feel like goin' for a run?
WENUS. Weekly Estimated Net...
Hannibal Lecter...better roommate than you.
Okay, is this lamp in the same place?
So, you still don't think I'm boyfriend material?
What size shoes do you wear?
Now imagine you live at the supermarket.
Okay, how long is this going to go on.
I think.... I think I can see your scalp.
Yeah! Okay, go, go, go get him.
I... I don't know... you seem lovely.
I think it's the dying cat parade.
Uh, let's see, who do I hate?
I didn't know you read tea leaves.
Ow, no 'woo-hooing,' no 'woo-hooing.'
This is terrible. What am I going to do?
Is there any chance you didn't see that?
Yeah, well, you're wrong! Okay, you're wrong.
Yes, it is, at Office Max.
Oh, what can happen? I mean, would you...
No actually, I was just going for colorful.
Like, when you're cooking a steak.
Hey man, how did the audition go?
Hey! Phoebe! We can talk to Phoebe!!
I can't believe she cracked your code!
Relax! We just get her some antacids.
I'm gonna call and get off work tomorrow!
Well, it makes me feel sad, but...
I've had a very long, hard day.
You're pretending the pillow's a girl right?
To Put the Camera Away!!!
Do you think you could get through a poem?
I'm still mad at you for not telling me.
...Poulet passes it up to Leetch!
Okay. It's not different at all, is it?
Joey! No way. I'm not answering that.
Hey Joe! I was just watching a movie-e-e...
I know this is really hard and we're really sorry.
Okay, it's not a guy, all right, I know her.
No-no, why don't you hang on to that one.
Listen, I-I'm gonna grab a beer.
Now-now, why would you say that Joseph?
Do you know which one you're gonna be?
Okay! This is it! We're gonna get married!
Now why would she say that's embarrassing?
What a coincidence, I listen in my sleep.
Uh, Dana Keystone from college.
Hey Ross, look what I've got going here.
Alright! Just follow my lead!
What? What are you, what are you talking about?
I'm watching the game, but I'm not deaf!
So they're going on dates? When?
I'm Chandler. Hey, I was in the scouts too.
Ah, it's just a weekend, big deal!
Hell is filled with people like you.
I don't have a *job*! *Closing Credits*
Yeah, I know, I did that two minutes ago.
Maybe Monica has a bobby pin.
No. But I'm sure 'tomatoes' does.
Oh, I see what you mean, that's quite nice.
No, our guy is just a floating head.
I'm afraid I can't let you do that, Joe.
Okay, but don't you think this is a little extreme?
I know it would make me happy, ma'am.
Now, is that never talking about it again?!
Oh, that's OK, we'll figure something out.
Ooh, I'm alive with pleasure now.
Nothing, Monica and I had a stupid fight.
Hey! Do we have a baby name yet?
Why would the baby creep me out?
Dying people say the craziest things.
If you win, we give up the birds.
Are you trying to do a British accent?
Hey hey! Where's the birthday girl?
Y-Y-YEEESSS! Make "groom" for Chandler.
Depends on what you mean by we.
Okay. Well, I think the centerpieces are too big
YOU NEVER DID IT!
Well sensitive is important, pick him.
Oh well, that, that makes it not terrible.
Ethan? There's, there's an Ethan?
I was in the car with Nancy all day.
Yeah, in fact my father was a den-mother.
Uhm, we've got turkey grease.
Do you happen to know what I'm going to say?
Yeah, just leave me alone for a while.
Oh my God! That's why I got up too!
You're on in 5 Ms. Minnelli.
Hey, look, we're on that TV thing!
And monkeys can't write out prescriptions.
Something so sweet and...disturbing about that.
Guess who's back in show business.
So uh, what did this woman look like?
Don't judge me, I'm only human!
Well, your gonna need much bigger jars.
Pregnant Woman Slays Four?
You tricked me to get me into bed?
He took my joke, he took it.
He's really picky about his patients.
How can you not be wearing any underwear?
Hey Caitlin! Somebody got a haircut.
Okaaay, rock, hard place, me.
See, that's why we don't let her play.
Maybe we should give them some privacy.
Are you sure? Did you see the stain?
Ah, sure, Nina. Whats up?
Here we go. Okay, brace yourselves.
All right, look, look, what am I gonna do?
No, you kidding? The guy's a freak..
That's what you say at the end of a date.
Good luck, man. I hope you get it.
Actually, it's Miss Chinandolor Bong.
You can say that because she's not your mom.
That was you?! I thought it was Jack!
It got interesting! Damn you Oprah!
We should always always break up together.
You gotta let me slam the door!
I am proud of all my friends today.
Look, we have enough, just walk away.
No, no, no, actually losers rhyme.
We wanna hear Monica's Thanksgiving story!
Your Veal Chop is $34,95!
We don't know what could make this go away.
I think somebody has a crush on somebody.
I don't suck. It's sucks. You suck.
You are not going to believe what I did today!
Yeah I know, guess who beeped him?
David, I'm pretending to read here!!
I'm pretty sure I put her on my bed.
Oh, hurry up. I want to sign that.
Yeah. You're right. Hey I-I can do that.
So you didn't uh, choose Ross before me.
Well, it didn't say "This is a virus"!!
Phoebe, we can hear the dog barking!
Yeah. And what you're doing feels so good.
I wish I had smoked for my career...
Stupid, useless Canadian money!
So, uh... what do you think it is about me?
Would you tell her I let you win please?
You are, you're gonna leave me like this?
I think we may have really done it this time.
'Cause he was just so darn cute.
Run, Joey! Run for your life!
And is this in case the house sneezes?
Wait. Advertising! That's a great idea!
This is the worst bachelor party ever!
We got some Vap-O-Rub in some places.
Multiple, so many paper cuts.
I'm sorry we, we don't have your sheep.
Do you really find this attractive on him?
Why did you look at me when you said that?
No, it came out to an even twenty.
Honey, you remember my boss Doug right?
Yes, please don't spoil all this fun.
It's weird! In a doctor's office?
Because you're the only one that can be fair.
Look Eddie, aren't you forgetting anything?
All right, that's it, give me your underwear.
Honey, there's really nothing to worry about.
What does it look like? I'm going home.
And you're our age. You're our age.
There it is! So what're you gonna do?
That guy's going home with a note!
Whoever stood you up is a jerk.
I don't think we've actually done this before!
Those were like the best seats ever.
Uh, no Pheebs. What's it look like?
Why is there jelly on your shoe?
Hey ladies! What are you in here for?
And look how happy the mom is now!
Was it like a sneeze only better?
What're we gonna do? What're we gonna do?
What do you mean, like, buy it together?
Everything's gonna be all right. Okay, Dick?
No, it was me. I'm sorry. I over reacted.
Are you eating the cheesecake without me?!
You dove in front of Ross! Ross!
It is starting to get dark out there.
But you found the keys to his clothes?
It's okay, it's just an egg roll.
That's Mr. Girabaldi playing the piano.
The young hot ball and chain.
Which technically now you should give back!
I mean, what am I supposed to do with myself?
You-you-you don't wanna give into the fear.
We're getting the house. We're getting the house.
Is this a service you're providing me?
I just didn't want to tell you in front of them.
Marcel swallowed a Scrabble tile.
No-no, not something stupid, something huge.
Oh nope, I-I have plans with Joey.
Well, uh, we can talk about that too Pheebs.
I feel violated. And not in a good way.
How long you been waitin' to say that?
Shocking! Since you still have the keys.
Oooh, I'm afraid that does not exist.
What, you guys really think that I'm that shallow?
You go back to work tomorrow night, right?
Really?! That's what you heard? You said that?
Okay we have to do something about your breath.
Okay, listen this really hurts. Let's go.
So you might say, the ring is irreplaceable?
Do not speak ill of the dead.
You put your fist through the wall?
I just have to know, okay. Is it my hair?
Oh, is she related to Ralph Lauren?
I don't think you did a very thorough job!
How about to the street say from the balcony?
Ba dum bumb cheshhh!
THAT'S TOO MUCH INFORMATION!!
Was the setting of Phoebe's triumph.
Ahh, ooh, try a hard 8.
You're obviously not their favorite pet.
Ginger. I'm talking to Ginger, so....
Bye-bye little puppet Joey hand?
I can't talk to you now, I gotta find Monica!
We can? All right, I'm tryin' that.
You can be the best man when I get married.
The cushions are the essence of the chair!
I can save you time ladies, I'm right here.
That's funny, we were doing the same thing!
Yeah alright. What're these, raisins?
Uhh, you've had a lot of sex right?
Oh, no, no, no dear God, no!
Well, Ross and Emily aren't gonna use it.
So I guess we wear swimsuits in here!
Why don't you just give him to somebody else?
Oh dear God, there's two of them!
Oh, yeah! RACHEL TALKS TOO!
Oh no-no, no you don't, just come back.
Oh no-no-no, I'm, I'm paddling away!
So she's just waiting over there for ya?
Alright, hang on a second there Custer.
I don't, and I'm offended by the insinuation!
Of course I will call you. I love you.
Oh. Nope, that patch is no good.
Well, I think it's very brave what you said.
Oh! Worm medicine for the duck.
Oh yea, your right. It's the second one.
I know, I hate being left out of things.
I called you fat?! I don't even remember that!
Treeger's snaking the shower drain.
Why have I seen this thing three times?!
Shhh, busy beaming with pride.
Is that what this is about? You like Caitlin?
O-kay. I'll see if I can find Ross.
Oh, thank you, sir... or man-who's-two-years-younger-than-me.
Julie Grath, my camp girlfriend.
So you might say, it's a magic ring.
I can't believe I did this! What an idiot!
Yeah well, I hear the place looks great.
Well, this does butch it up a bit.
Then why didn't you tell me to do that?!!
98. 99. 100. Okay, go!
Where is she? I'm not scared of you!
And yet I never run into Beyonce!
You got waaaay too much free time.
Why can't I tell them that we live together?
I'm not your garbage man. I'm your mailman.
Monica can I talk to you outside for a minute?
Well that was before all the vaporizing action.
It is when you put it together with that one.
Okay, that's like the least fun game ever.
Well, I-I just didn't think it was funny sir.
Yeah, we'll be down in like five minutes.
I used to undress my cousin Glenn.
All right! Isn't this a woman's hat?
...And then he burst into flames.
I've got five bucks says you can't.
Thank you! All right, I gotta go unpack.
Well, I thought you guys were cuddlily sleepers.
Without my toe?! I need my toe!
Oh good, I was hoping that would come up.
Well, we're gonna... we're gonna figure this out.
That's the way I did it 'til I was 19.
Does that mean I get the good loving tonight?
Ding dong, the psycho's gone.
No, no! We made this decision together.
Well I've-I've never done that with you before.
Really? You got us a chick and a duck?
Relax! We'll just get her some antacids.
My God! You must be good in bed!
I did not say fat! I said, "Fa-aa-aw-ow..."
And I am not blah, I am a hoot!
Gary, I'm here to report a crime.
Skidmark's still got a way with the ladies.
You may wanna get some more of those too.
Now I've upset you? What did I say?
Santa pants. Santa Claus's pants.
No, the doctors say it may kill her.
I wanted to be with you. I missed you so much.
Wow! I don't have the worst costume anymore!
Thanks. You wanna see what it looks like?
O-okay. So, is she gonna take the test?
Well, you know, I appreciate you giving it a shot.
Were you're parents happy, or something?
Well, I thought- I thought you talked to Rick.
Well, remember the first time we saw Jaws?
Then why-why is she going to a play?!
No, you sh-No you said you made that up!!
Would you give me one minute!! Please.
Or facing a bitch of a commute.
We are NOT signing those papers.
You have no trouble telling time now right?
That's just a lot of big talk, y'know.
They have that on the napkins at the club.
Y'know what, we have to turn off the porn.
Would you come on! Come on! Thank you.
So, what do you thing the good news is?
Well, why don't we move this into the bedroom?
Helen drinks. Will you marry me?
Ok, you're going to have to stop that, forever!
Wow! She looks great. Doesn't she?
Here, pass these, will ya..
Hey! Which one's my turkey burger?
Okay. My word! Those are snug.
Ok. First of all, this is green!
I don't want him to tell this story for years.
Because soap is soap. It's self-cleaning.
Yeah, we're gonna have to get you out of those shoes.
To the left, to the left- aww!
Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas!
You didn't see how mad he was, y'know?
Hey, that's... that's 'joincidence' with a 'C'!
Couldn't I just say, "This is Ross?"
Yeah o-okay, but I'm just doing this for you.
No Joey! No Joey! Don't Joey! Joey!
So you risked your life, for a sandwich!
Oh yeah? Is he funnier than me?
It just doesn't...feel like we're breaking up.
Did he just say, he loves Fonzie?
Well, she looks the exact opposite of that.
Y'know, I saw a wine cellar downstairs...
Because it's a relaxing and enjoyable time!
I can't believe you don't know what I do for a living!
Yes! See you and I have always been like-
Myyy mother, ladies and gentlemen.
You're kidding! Did you tell her I wasn't?
So, how many have you sold so far?
Okay, how many of that girl are you seeing?
Phoebe, would you take a look at this mess!!!!
Yeah! yeah... The hard part is over!
The Sooner State, whatever that is.
Hi, I'm Chandler. Your live-in boy
I still don't get it, we didn't do anything wrong.
So y'know, uh, when's he getting back?
Yeah, like that thought never entered my mind.
Look Joe, I know you wanted to do the wedding...
Well, I don't really know what that is, but let's!!
Oh, it's awkward. It's awkward. It's awkward.
Monica, we are not ready to have two babies!
Aren't you just a tinsy bit curious?
No, Eddie likes to keep it over there.
Okay, look, I'm gonna have to ask you all to leave.
That, that is funny. Can I have it back?
Ooh, she should not be wearing those pants.
I'm telling you I think Phoebe thinks I'm foxy.
I don't know! You'll tell us on Monday!
Oh, my god, I'm so sorry. Are you ok?
You're not actually supposed to stop on the bridge.
Okay! Oh man! Don't tell me I did this!
I swallowed the sonic blaster gun.
Dear God! This parachute is a knapsack!
I totally understand. Can I just see your bra?
I'll bet his dad doesn't think so.
And I also got... two more apples.
Hello...? Have you seen Joey's bat?
It's okay, you don't have to be the best at everything.
Uh, Magellan? You got 46 states.
No, just the months you actually want to live here.
Oh, by the way, that is her full name.
Is that Joey?! Let me talk to him!
Yup, get ready for the gelatenous fun.
Unwilling to steal from work, interesting.
I'm talking about you. You big, big freak.
Well, you're welcome! Glad I could help.
You couldn't have told me about this on the phone?
Sorry, the first guy runs the lips.
You are aware that she's not a monkey, right?
Seriously dude, 3 years ago.
Are you looking at naked tribe's women?
Monica, you remember me telling you that joke, right?
David is going to propose to Phoebe tonight!
Yeah. Do we have any Fruit Roll-Ups?
Hey-hey, hey! I don't know why I did that!
Thank you so much for agreeing to see us.
Oh, yeah! Thanks for inventing the lottery!
It's my game. You want the job or not?
Well that puts me in a difficult position.
Well you might if it were anything like 7!
What about all that "friends forever" stuff?
Oh well you're the best. You come here to me.
Maybe, she doesn't hit him all the time.
Oh my God!! Is everybody getting married?!!
Can I check out what she did to my room?
Y'know, I was hoping for a little more enthusiasm.
Or we can do the actual telephone thing.
Course there, they just call it food.
Wait! You look? You-you massaged me.
Yeah. Solid effort. Solid effort.
You didn't think I used to wear glasses, right?
Yes! Yes, but I can only pay $8,000.
Just tryin' somethin' here, ya know.
I personally could have a gallon of Alan.
I'm not in a meeting. I'm right... Whoops.
Well, at least we got these little guys out.
Wait, wait! Wh-what are you doing here?
Y'know who has a great video camera?
Yo!! Spackel boy! Get up!
You're coming on to the entire room! I'm Chandler.
Just practicing. You're good. Carry on.
Not the disposable cameras from the tables.
Y'know that whole swimming thing is a myth.
And you wonder why Ross is their favorite?
Ahh, Merry Christmas; I miss you guys!
Hey Phoebs, can I have the milk after you?
Well maybe you should put some ice on it.
Oh, yeah, that hug looked pretty brutal.
Yes! Yes! A thousand times, yes!
Ok so, can I have my hat back?
Forget it! Okay, I'm not giving up the apartment.
Don't let yourself get manipulated this way!
I don't know, y'know. What, what, would you do?
No! No! No! No--one can beat me.
Hey! I'm sorry! That- where are you going?
Wouldn't it be easier if we just moved?
Oh, Satan's minions at work again...
OK Phoebs, how many do you want?
Y'know uh, you didn't really have to help me pack.
Again I must go back to, how?
See that is the problem with invisible dentists.
Yeah I just... wanted to call and say hey.
Totally. I had sex in High school...
Pheebs! We have to take you to the hospital now!
Yes, we do. But, we have to change first.
Laundry. Huh. Is that my new nickname?
All right, then massage me up right nice!
No. No, not at all, that's-that's ridiculous.
Ooh, this is a Dear Diary moment.
People do stupid things when they're upset.
Yeah, or you can do the easy thing and smoke.
Actually he's the smallest person in the world.
Hi. You guys have any wrapping paper?
You didn't bring me here to do that, did you?
Hey so, did uh, did she move out?
Oh my goodness! Where did you hide it?
Okay. So uh, Ross is kinda bummed huh?
Damnit. Alright call me when you know more.
Well I, I think we'd remember something like that.
Then free as a bird. What's up?
All right, let's show them how it's done.
Umm, not feeling better 'bout Malcom.
I was making a coconut phone with the professor.
No, just knowing you're gonna be there is enough.
Alright I'll tell you what, I'll play you for it.
...it was like the Algonquin kids table.
You told him to play the boxer gay!!
Princess Leia in the gold bikini.
Okay, will you just go help her change please!
Well, y'know, you and me, it had to end sometime.
I said, 'So I'm not gonna lose her?'
I don't know. But I know I'm not afraid to do this.
Can you see my nipples through this shirt?
Yeah, like there's any way I could ever do that.
Please, one ridiculous problem at a time!
Look at us, we're a couple of couples!
Man, those two dogs are going at it!
Actually, we already found a house we love.
Oh well, we don't because we got...the...other pl-place.
Ugly Naked Guy got a Thighmaster!
You are not allowed to laugh at my joke.
Okay, ten blocks down. Five to go.
Okay, well, then, I-I have to go to the bathroom.
At least as long as I have the pants.
Well, don't, don't think me immodest, but, me?
You are totally and completely 100% forgiven.
Don't ask me, I was in there canoodling you!
We're not gonna talk about girth are we?
Wow, it's, it's like porno for clowns.
Oh no, now it's not gonna make any sense!
Oh nothing, we're just talking. Y'know, blah-blah-blah.
You told us both we could be in the wedding?
Ooh, she's asleep, that means we can...
So you're never actually going to pay me back?
Ohh, umm, y'know what, I already ate.
No, no, you're right, it is a ridiculous name!
No not okay, you can't look for Monica's presents!
Are you asking permission to break the pact?
It's the semi-finals...of her...botchy ball tournament.
Rachel, I love you! Deal with me first!
Well, you can understand, given how we started.
Whoa, whoa, prom night flashback.
Well, invisible kids can be that way sometimes.
Why would Monica be keeping Richard in here?
Y'know, I knew something like this was going to happen.
Hey that's okay. So, where do you want to go?
You know, our band is playing on Friday.
I don't think that's what they were talking about Joe!!
Y'don't think that makes me seem a little...
Well, it does not ring a bell with me...
Jeez, relax! It's not like we're mar-ah-ah!!
Well, thanks man. Now I can get my pony.
Well, it's official there are no good movies.
Oh, and I promise, I will not fake it this time.
Yes it would. What do you say to $50?
The cold weather hurts my hip!
If I help, we can find 'em faster!
Just give us the cheapest room you have.
Yes, but I don't think life experience with these.
Well, maybe you can get in on a beauty scholarship.
I'm so glad we've got adjoining rooms!
You wanna see flirting? I'll show you flirting.
Well, uh, Dr. Greene, where are you going?
You guys just keep getting cooler and cooler!
It is the softest hair! Touch it!
I'm gonna go tell Emma she was an accident.
The ball is Janice. The ball is Janice.
Y'know, I, I really don't think we need a canoe.
Oooh! I hope you're happy too, honey!
I would never lie to get someone into bed.
Well, you remember Cathy Bates in Misery?
No. He.....he's coming out of his shorts.
... And where's this money coming from?
Knit, good woman, knit, knit!
Tuna or egg salad? Decide!
Hey Joe! You wanna shoot some hoops?
To be fair this one does have nuts.
Yeah, I-I-I think so. Yeah, I-I think so...
So, Spock actually hugs his father?
Excuse, I seem to have dropped my ball.
There's a tape here with Monica's name on it.
Do you want us to leave the room, or?
And thats the Chrysler Building right there.
Bermuda, Bahama, come on pretty mama...
Awful. Awful. Couldn'ta gone worse.
Oh, yeah, he's my... he's my best friend.
But nothing has to happen until your ready.
Alright. Wow, that is one disgusting miracle.
Well, You could, but... probably just the one time.
Ah, well no, it's just uh, me and Wendy.
Y'know I was thinking, what if I uh, unpack here?
What are you looking at me for? I didn't know that.
I am totally picturing you with all those women!
People who've never ever been to Paris.
I'll give you a thousand dollars to talk to us.
Alright, you did it! Do we have any fruit?
Hey, you know who used to have nails like that?
I can't believe it. Paolo kissed my mom?
Well, it sounds kinda stupid... Who's she?
Well, sure, but can you play it on a plane?
Great! This baby'd better to be really good.
What? Oh, yeah, I'm gonna be a junior copywriter.
Wow! That sandwich really does smell good.
Ah, you obviously saw my personal ad.
Why are you so sure I didn't watch this tape?
Okay, are you aware unagi is an eel?
Well, it throws my WENUS out of whack.
So there is no good time to ask that question.
Hey! Hi! You uh, ready to exchange gifts?
Oh, you should live with Joey, Roll-os everywhere.
Open up! Open up! Open up!
Say goodbye elves, I'm off to Tulsa.
Well, yeah... 's'no Brian in Payroll.
Oh, y'know, what did you mean when you said pivot?
Yeah, I don't you should say that even when you're healthy.
When was the last time you saw her wear it?
Oh come on, come on, it can't be that bad.
Stop it! We're doing this! Let's do it!
Joey and I can finish up in the guest room.
Do you realize you get louder each week?
So uh, what's this thing you're auditioning for?
I know, I, I should have talked to you first about it.
It's the theme from Good Will Humping.
I have a job interview I have to get ready for.
Well let's....let's see what everybody thinks of that?
Well if people don't know they shouldn't just guess!
Whoa-whoa-whoa, what are we going to do about my job?
I can't believe you'd want us to raise Emma.
You couldn't have at least changed your shirt.
Okay, it's just that dogs make me a little uncomfortable.
You don't owe me anything, I don't want you money...
Ooh! Israeli champagne. And it's vanilla!
Hey Eddie, you uh, wanna play some foosball?
Honey, the tortilla chips know what you mean.
And what does she have to think about? I love her!
He's finally happy with that and walks away.
Yeah... Well, it's a good thing we got it then.
I, I'm sorry, I uh I already have a roommate.
No, I have a great idea for a present for her.
So Joey breaks my chair and I get nothing!
Looks like Joey is doing allright with her.
So, ah... Any plans for the summer?
Well, yeah, but y'know, what-what if I was wrong?
Well, that's impossible, can you check again, please?
Wait a minute! I have a date tomorrow night.
I know it. You know, I'm totally gonna ask her out.
Nice job Joe! You're quite the craftsmen.
Pete Becker. Pete... Is this him?
: What do you need, what do you need?
Okay, but if he asks, I'm not going to lie.
Oh that's so funny because we found someone too.
Well, I think, I think Ross knows about me and Monica.
Honey, it's us. Of course it's the shovel-killer.
The floating heads do make a good point.
I can't believe this! What the hell were you thinking?
And the moment of joy is upon us.
Hardest thing I've ever done in my life.
Anyway, err... I need to borrow some money.
One more score to go! You can do it!
I'm so tired. Yeah okay, but no foreplay.
I mean, I know that's not possible, but he does.
Why did you take the shower curtain down?
Y'know you, really didn't have to take me to the airport.
What does a Wicked Wango card do?
Please, please, please, don't be mad at me.
Yes! You want babies! You have baby fever!
I think it's great. Y'know, it's sweet, it's romantic...
It is. Did I... not tell you about her?
Joey, this is Die Hard 1 again.
Yes, but haven't you wanted a kid like forever?
Man, if only you'd gotten here sooner.
Right, fine, I'll do it, but no talking.
But you already gave all your money to charity!
So, who's up for a big game of Kerplunk?
Because you shouldn't be with him. You should be with me.
I tell people secrets. It makes them like me.
Our new fridge? I don't live here anymore.
I'm not crazy about babies. I'm crazy about us.
Jill says vestibule... I'm going with vestibule.
Oh, I don't think it was desperate, I think it was amazing!
Well that would be nice. I'll go get the lotion.
'So Cheesy' also has an opening.
Ohh! You guys gonna be living together again?
Okay, but that's, like, the easiest era.
Okay. You were right. I'm in love with Joey's girlfriend.
Ooh, I hate when my father calls me that.
You don't get a lot of 'doy' these days...
Okay, I gotta ask, who calls us that?!
Actually, it pays nothing. It's an internship.
Did you make it, or are you just serving it?
Monica, I think you've gone over to the bad place.
And if not, we got to do it on a bucket.
Didn't you used to call it the Little Major?
So how's it going there in Financial Services?
No you don't-get it in black, not brown.
Hey, buddy boy, how'd the audition go?
Who sold a story to Archie Comics?!
The tall girl who wouldn't sleep with you?
Why is Phoebe singing to Carl Mulden?
Yes... thank you. That was... that was....
Okay, I don't sound like that. That is so not true.
Tell her, I'm allergic, and I will sue!
Hmm, let's see if it comes up this time.
Maybe that's because she's a minion of the anti-Christ.
So you kissed her, so what happened after that?
Ahh yes, the messers become the messies!
I'd be sad sure, but I wouldn't cry.
Yeah, you think so, well? Should I ask him?
Please tell me you know which one is our baby.
Well, why don't you tell her to stop being silly!
Well, you can't say we don't know how to throw a party.
I still can't believe they promoted her to lieutenant.
He paints quite a picture doesn't he?
Oh man! I am so excited-I may vomit!
So, what do you say? Can you get out of work?
Maybe I should quit and get a job that pays.
Okay, I'll try. And you can't make any noise.
Why come all the way from Kansas to do that?
Hey, stick a fork in me, I am done.
I'm still on London time, does that count?
Uhh, yes, absdolutely, um. Why again?
No, I saw a picture of you covered in blueberries.
All this lying has been hard on us too.
She likes Doctor Chandler and Reverend Monica.
Oh please, and you knew how much I liked her.
Oh yeah. I'll take, I'll take your picture.
Oh yeah, me too, she's so cool and pretty.
Well, there you are! So what did Elizabeth say?
Or what my Father called Thursday night.
Y'know, I sensed that I should stop. So we're okay?
Ross had a ring?! And he was gonna propose?
Oh wow! Is that what this all have been about?
I can't believe there is a naked hooker in there!
What does it look like I'm doing? I am cleaning!
Sorry, we're on a major flan high.
Yes, yes, but did you see who she was dating?
We think he was trying to spell out 'MONKEY.'
Yes, if the foxhole was lined with sandwiches.
Joe, I told you, you're just not right for the part.
He pulled a quarter out of my ear!
Oh, so you're already doing your part for the kids.
Wow! You are way to young to have seen that!
Oh, come on. You told me about the last dream.
I'm sure it's somebody for you. Now, go hide.
How long it took to go back in the water?
Where's Joey? His mom's on the phone.
Good idea. Where do you want to go to lunch?
Pull my finger--My hand is messed up.
You know, I'd love to, but I'm a little tired.
To my best bud. Thanks best bud.
Really? Then what are they doing in our guestroom?
I don't know. Maybe we can open this up somehow.
Do you have any beers? We're out of beers.
I can't take the big white dog! You love it!
Okay, don't say anything, you might scare it away.
Just tell me what I need to do to make things right.
What are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing?
Okay, so now do you believe that she's attracted to me?
It hurts me. It physically hurts me.
It is not okay that I'm aroused by this now.
What are you, what are you gonna show me my clothes?
Maybe the problem was you were pronouncing it kara-tay.
Oh that's great, with my luck, that's gonna be him.
We heard you play all the way from your apartment!
So um, Mary-Angela, what's your second favorite?
I think that's the youngest girl ever to reject me.
Hey, listen, why don't we go change in my room?
Don't you have to be Claymation to say stuff like that?
Angela's the screamer, Andrea has cats.
I'm gonna miss being able to afford food.
It kills over one americans every year.
Monica! This is the Men's room! Isn't it?
Y'know, sometimes that fake out thing is just mean!
We came over as soon as we saw.
Uh Kathy, with K or a C?
And yet, she's still not hanging up the phone.
I thought you were showing me how much you mean to me.
All right fine! But I'm only doing this for you!
That's how radio stars escape stalkers.
Then you distract her with a Barbie doll.
Well, this is fascinating. So, uh, what is it about me?
Like finding money with naked people on it!
God why why would you want to do that to yourself!?
Okay, umm, we all have to play strip poker.
Oh, it's so hard to care when you're this relaxed.
We're just hanging out by the spoons. Ladle?
Ok, good night. You big freak of nature.
No, she's still upset because I saw her boobies.
Is that gal pal spelled L-O-S-E-R?
Yeah, Jell-o just like Mom used to make.
Ahh, just like the apothecary tables of yore...
Hello Phoebe, I've been thinking about you all day.
You know, I - I think you're set with the poultry.
Too many jokes... must mock Joey!
Oh that's all right, I have it memorized. It's 1A.
I thought...maybe...you got me porn for Valentine's Day.
Well, it certainly worked for that Valdez kid.
Hey! Everybody at work loved you last night!
Okay, you know, you know when your in bed, with a woman.
Come on, he won't even know what they mean.
Oh, well someone left this . This is yours?
Mr. D, hows it going, sir?
Woah, woah, I've put on a little weight?
Hi sweetie. So, what was with all the whispering?
Batman has Robin! We get ESPN right?
Oh god, I have to tell you something. You're not pregnant.
I'll take this one too Uh ... Mommy?
Yeah, she seemed cool, attractive. I'll do it.
Yeah, just think of it as $25 per room!
Well, does that mean that you're not going to wearing yours?
And we're done with the chicken fried rice.
Well I've forgotten what it tastes like okay?!
Yeah, yeah, it's just that with my last roommate Kip...
Hi! We're checking out of the bridal suite.
In a minute? What's gonna happen in a minute?!
Yeah, I don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet.
Forget what I said, I was babbling! Pick me!
Get ready to run. Congratulations on your wedding.
Please don't do that again, it's a horrible sound.
A dinosaur died a million years ago?
Why? Do you another boyfriend in there or something?
Yes, apparently Stevie and the band are like this.
'Look, Gippetto, I'm a real live boy.'
Who cares? Nobody reads those things.
See that'll stop when you pick up the phone.
Run! Run you crazy, rich freak!
Well, I'm not really in a sexy mood right now.
Bit country? C'mon in here you roomie.
Oh that's all right sir, and that's just one girl.
Our kids are gonna be fat aren't they.
Really? Struck down in the pribe of libe!
It's kinda a ah, a third nipple kinda thing.
Oh, I have to get married in James Bond's tux!
Oh, ahh, no thanks, I just had an M&M.
It must take you forever to find your keys.
Joe, I don't think this is going to be your big break.
Well we could just stay in and cook for ourselves.
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!!
Is it wrong that I was totally aroused by that?
Ahhhh-gaaaahhh. Eddie what're you still doin' here?
He's not gonna make it, he's stuck in Chicago.
Uh, Rach... I think I have something that belongs to you.
Isn't that what happened with you and the bride's maid?
Hey, that monkey's got a Ross on its ass!
Oh, I'm fine about my problem now, by the way.
But those are the words! Those exact words!
Well, now we have one of each! And that's enough!
Yes! You mean the world the world to me. Oh...
Well, then, I might as well offer to stay.
Hey, check out that girl! She is really hot!
Did your Dad ever dress up like Santa?
Hey! Oh, good, Ross! You're parents like me, right?
No, no, you got zero points for 'IDNEY'.
Ok, think, what would Jack and Chrissy do?
Well, I officially give you permission to break the pact.
Well, I told you not to walk. Here. There. Okay.
What!? They are totally ripping us off!
Suddenly I wish I was reading my own name.
If we do that, we gotta get Die Hard.
Sweet mother of all that is good and pure.
Well, you got here just in time. I really have to go buddy.
Yeah I even got a ring. Did you get a ring?
He's the headliner of a gay burlesque show.
There was no fish when she dropped it off.
Why do they put so much steam in there?!
Well get rid of her, obsessive and shrill.
Oh, just a bit of shopping. How've you been?
That's awesome! That's great! What made you do it?!
Looking for restaurant jobs for you in Tulsa.
See, maybe that's the one we should've actually hidden.
So, are you really gonna go out with that nurse man?
Not exactly. . . I'm wearin panties.
Ahh, you know what? That is....Who wouldn't want you?
Yeah, yeah, she works over at that place, uh...
Ahh, so how many cameras are actually on you?
Me and Frank and Phoebe, Graduation 1965.
So, thanks for having me over! Rach. Pheebs.
Really?! I didn't think girls ever just wanted a fling.
Wow! Fortunately she has a very pretty face!
I couldn't find anything at Joey--Hey-hey, oh hey!
Phase Three! I just achieved Phase Three!
Okay, let me just straighten out your helmet there.
Okay, but after that, we're shootin' some pool.
Yeah, see, I can't pull of baby-doll can I?
Hey, hey, those guys are takin our stuff!
How can I answer that when I'm pretending I don't know you?
This is bringing out a lovely color in you!
Hey, I had a terrible childhood and I don't do porn.
Yes you did! Admit it! You freaked out!
Buy it for ya, or win it for ya?
Oh yeah, then uh, what was Phoebe's song about?
Well, I try to y'know, squeeze things. Are you okay?
Oh honey, leave them alone, they're in love.
Ohhh Oh no, wait a minute, I have no one.
I think you played the Gunther card too soon.
Hey Eddie. Daahh!! What're you doin' here?
Me, that guy who just said butt cracks?
Pheebs, wake up and smell the restraining order.
Yes. Hey, can I ask you, is Eddie a little...
Monica got ice in her eye, and it hurts.
You sure you don't wanna stick around a little longer?
Oh I'm so sorry man! Is there anything I can do?
Oh, he works in the Fine Foods division.
You look amazing. I'm the luckiest man in the world.
Oh, I would never bet this apartment. It's too nice.
Y'know, I'm so glad I picked you to help me with this.
I am only one man! Okay Ross, time is up!
So, you stole my joke, and you stole my money.
Oh, no no no, she took off with my clothes.
I don't know what it is, I just can't take a good picture.
Hi, could we get two burritos to go, please?
What's the matter with me? Why I'm such a girl?
Yeah, she couldn't live without the Chan Love.
At least let me smoke it to the good part.
Hey, how'd it go? How'd she like the gift?
I know it's tough now, but things will get better.
Okay, you guys spend waaaay too much time together.
I didn't know you and Carol were getting divorced, I'm sorry.
No, just wanna make sure we're on the same page.
No, you keep the pack. I'm all cried out today.
No-no, I mean what, what's this about your new place?
Ladies? Ross's speech is in 45 minutes.
I can't believe Joey. I hate being called a liar!
Phoebe found your pregnancy test in the trash.
And you left the toilet seat up, you bastard.
No, I think we're just blurry shapes to him now.
All right! I'm putting it out, I'm putting it out.
Don't worry about it. I'm taking care of it tonight.
You should be. You're really on top of stuff..
Hey, shut up!! You're not my real Mom!!
So do you think uh, Joey's more charming than me?
Kids, new dream... I'm in Las Vegas.
Turns out they can't fire me. Because I quit.
The Velveteen Rabbit was brown and white!
Authorization? I don't need that. I'm gonna put everything back.
Bing doesn't seem so weird now, does it?
To yourself. Hey-hey-hey, y'know what that's pretty good.
No, you don't have to, and you can't because I live here too.
It's perfect. It's everything we've been looking for.
Please let me stay on this side of the door.
Okay. Okay, now wait a minute that was totally different.
Honey, there are like 20 tickets on the nightstand!
I am sorry, moment to make fun of that, please!
You still haven't told Rachel you weren't really proposing?
Oh that's so sweet! I want to show you something too!
Ahh, do you have any coconut flavoured deities?
Did she see us yet? Did she see us?
We have to leave for New York in an hour.
Sorry. I'm sorry. Y'know what, we're just gonna throw it.
You obviously haven't tasted my Palmolive potatoes!
Oh and Ross was like what? A lion tamer?
Yeah. Oh it's not warm yet, we still have time.
No, it's suicide. The man's got an egg.
Oh, I'm taking my ex-girlfriend of my speed dialer.
Okay. You have to stop the Q-tip when there's resistance!
Those are book ends! That's a great gift!
Okay! So, what do you girls have planned for tonight?
Sounds good to me... but what would a guy think?
So ah, isn't a bit cold out for shorts?
Are you suggesting we dance our troubles away?
Uh honey, I know you don't like to relinquish control...
Ahh, I think it just moved. It's really poking me.
Worst porn ever! Worst porn ever!
Okay! That's a four! And where-where's the other one?
I messed up. Okay? I'm sorry, I really messed up.
Hey, why don't you wear those earrings I gave you?
Ahh, no thanks. No chicken, bye-bye then.
I doubt that! Tell her about us last year.
Ok, on your mark... Get set... GO!!!
Phoebe is going to say "yes"? That's, that's great!
Well, that's not true, he-he smacked you once.
So umm, you-you flirt with guys all the time?
Wow, in 45 minutes you can find her twice.
When you're marrying us; that's what you should say.
Y'know, I-I can't really put a price on that Joe.
That's fast math! We could use you in Tulsa.
I missed most of the party Charlie's a girl, right?
Oh wait... What bed did you say she was on?
I fear a jury will see it the same way!
Oh right, your allergies. All her, she hates you.
Next time you snore, I'm rolling ya over!
So is your apron. You're wearing it like a cape.
Oh, yeah? What happened when we played last time?
I can't even believe this! I really come off that badly?
Okay. I just wanted them to hear it from somebody else.
No,... no... NO! Look, I'm, I'm married!
I'm sorry, is this a game for Emma or for Monica?
Guys are signing over their 401-K's to me?
I can do that, I've had 30 years of practice.
I think she looks cute. ... but I am wrong!
Yeah, here, somewhere else, y'know where-where ever.
Oooh that may be a New World's record
Yes, Janice. Why is that so difficult for you to comprehend?
You want me to wash my hands first, don't you?
Listen, they are really great. If you just got a chance...
Just coffee! Where are we gonna hang out now?
That's weird. I don't think my boss likes me either.
Oh yes, yes... let me... take your coat.
I didn't know you were taking a class. That is so cool.
She'll love it. Go with the egg, my friend.
Don't worry honey, we'll make yours funnier.
Well, you still havent taken down the Christmas lights.
Okay. Okay. What are you gonna do to me if you get the part?
It's so good I don't know what I've done to deserve it!
Well she's, she's the kinda girl-Joey was unconscious.
If I'm goin' down, I'm takin' everybody with me.
Yes, I know, but her friend sounds like such a...
And no one touches the air around the TV!
Oh, beautiful? Really? Beautiful? You think this is beautiful?
I just don't see why those two can't work things out!
Oh uh well tomorrow's no good for her either.
What a great apology! And you accept! Okay, bye-bye!
Don't try to make me uncomfortable with feminine stuff!
Who did you originally want to hook up with?
Scared me out of ever wanting to live with him.
Well it you don't know that, then I don't want to do this with you.
I like it in the stern. ...of the boat. Hello.
Ahh, Gepeto, $5,000 dollars? Are you insane?
Honey, try to focus the trash talk on him!
What are doing? You know I can only dish it out!
Well y'know, things are different. I'm...I'm married now.
All right, well I'm gonna put my sweats back on.
Uh yes, but uh, I just watch it for the articles.
Oh that's great, my friend Joey's in the movie business.
Look, we just think that maybe she's being a little unreasonable.
Ok honey. that was close. -Cut to Rachel.
You'll be perfect for this! That's already your name!
You're gonna put on sweats and clean, aren't you?
Well it wouldn't kill you to say it once in a while.
All right, look! Look. I think I can explain this.
Wow! Pregnancy does give you some weird cravings.
Wow! That ripped! That ripped real nice!
Okay, I'm a rookie. I should not be in the end zone.
Uh-uh, yes. I would like to see that ring please.
Hey, what are you doing here? Shouldn't you be at work?
But it's all so overwhelming. I don't know where to start.
I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name. Paul, was it?
I was just trying to bring a little culture to the group.
Phebes, it was your birthday, like, months ago.
Hey, what do I know? I wanted to get a bigger gorilla.
Cry?! I just found a talking puppy, I'm rich!
Boy did we make friends with the wrong sister!
Look, this isn't funny! You get back here right now!
I love the specifics, the specifics were the best part!
No, that's all right. I just had a jar of mustard.
I'm sorry. If you ask me, I'd move in with him.
Nah, Phoebs, that's the guy that comes in the frame.
Oh, sweet Lord. New realms of pleasure!
Well, you don't you have Captain Hook explain it to her.
Don't listen to him, he's in a really bad mood!
Yes, but the coffee table doesn't match the...blahebdmsdlkhdyslkd;btyds...Rooosss!!!!
Making chocolate milk. Do you want some?
Yes, yes, we did, thanks to Vidal Buffay.
And I just realized I can sleep with my eyes open.
Yeah well, too bad we're gonna have to return them.
Yes I'm gonna put it back exactly where I found it.
Let me think. Let me think-Oh! I don't care.
Excuse me, Doug? Hey there sports fan!!
Which I may say, right now, is out of control.
Well, whatever it is, I hope it involves winking.
Oh Jeez honey, I thought, I thought you were asleep.
No. No I'm just tired. Y'know, from-from the walk.
Now, it's not wrapped because I just, just finished it.
Because it's flattering! Come on Monica! Come on Monica!
Yes, that is cool. Because I have models here y'know......never.
So you don't get paid unless the movie makes money?
Well, I'm sure you get another one at Ann Taylor's.
As we all are at some point during the day.
Wow!! Can Joey and I put them on and fight?
This is ridiculous, he's not gonna hold his breath...
Oh... I don't know, I really don't think you're right for the part.
We're just here to say goodbye, we're off to Ohio.
They're terrific, and they live right here in the city.
Blue blazer back. He-he wants it back.
I see, I see, y-y-you're trying to freak me out.
Aww, turkey! Aww, giving thanks! Aww!
Well okay Jerry, thanks for stopping by.
Yeah, at least you hid your feelings well about it.
Your computer, I don't know wha... everything's gone!
Wow, there's my fantasy come true. No, seriously.
Yes, and we call Ross Lingers In The Bathroom.
If that doesn't keep kids in school, what will?
I have no idea what's going on, but I am excited!
No-no-no-no, this is bad! It's bad! This is bad!
Pheebs, we're not giving you a deposit for our wedding!
I am not working. There's not much to do around here!
Im just trying to find the right moment, you know?
I wasn't doing anything. Uh-oh, what did she do now?
This isn't your first surprise party, is it sir?
Hello? It's Nancy, they responded to our offer.
So you must be going to somewhere fancy to celebrate?
Well, I'm, I'm sorry... Ahhh. Have we met?
Fun Bobby? Your ex-boyfriend Fun Bobby?
Yeah I know, we're losing Ross, Joey said hence...
How can he do that? Didn't you sign a lease?
So those were pity laughs? PITY LAUGHS?
Oh, y'know-y'know what, I was looking at it upside down.
Yeah, well, don't expect that to happen anytime soon!
Yeah, well, good luck trying to top the last one.
Yeah, ah, ah . . . I'll think of something.
With Roger? Not just with Roger?! Oh my God!
What are you guys? Like a gang or something?!
Wow! You look just like your son Mrs. Tribbiani!
I shouldn't even bother coming up with a line, right?
I got caught up and work, but I'm quitting tomorrow.
Well y'know, what if she didn't actually sleep with the guy?
And you don't think taking care of our chick is work?
Yes indeedy! With a beautiful view of...
I see. Y'know umm, Phoebe makes sock bunnies.
Janice, I'm sorry but umm, you can't stay here tonight.
Yeah, come on, it's Ross and Rachel, they've got too.
Well y'know a lot of those Muppets don't have thumbs.
Okay, well I won't uh, worry about this anymore then.
Oh yeah! Okay, let's play again. What do you got?
I have the lung capacity of a two year old.
Yeah, I'm kinda wishing everyone wasn't here right now.
Well, it's, it's yummy. So Mary-Angela do you like it?
Seriously sir, my brains? All over the wall.
Is this why they don't like me or why you don't like me?
Okay, listen, how far am I gonna have to go with her?
Do you know me or are you just really good at this game?
That was so unlikely. Well, let's get married! I guess.
Do we have any... Do we have any thoughts here?
No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no!!! You can't come in here! R-r-r-r-Ross is naked.
Well now you have two. Hey, I am good at math.
Wow! So tonight may be the night! You're nervous?
That was not a security blanket! That was a wall-hanging!
It could've been worse, he could've shot her.
I messed up, it was a meeting, everybody was smoking.
Was his question what's more boring than him?
Yes, it's working! Why isn't she calling me back?
So uh, man, are you gonna go to the play with me tonight?
I wouldn't brag too much about that thing, big guy.
Well then, how do you know when vegetables are done?
Yeah. Oh no wait, I'm not an nine-year-old girl.
Look, she's not backing down! She went like this!
Okay, there's something different though--Oh my God! You smoked!
Hey! Can you take a duck and a chick to the theatre?
I can see it now, "Look dad, it's the Sphinx!"
Honey, are you seriously ever gonna wear the boots again?
It's like a baby caterpillar chasing its mama!
Dum! Dum-dum-dum! Dum! Dum! Dum! Dum-dum-dum!
Good job Joe! Well done! Top notch!
She's not as pretty as she was when she was 29.
Oh don't forget, my office holiday party is tonight.
Come on! I was there! I know he's the love of your life.
I'm gonna say this for the last time. Would you please just...
I know, let's rest and drink lots of fluids.
Hello? Oh, uh, Rachel, it's the Visa card people.
Y'know, I was thinking about ah, asking her for her number.
Okay, I'm gonna go to the bathroom. Will you watch my phone?
You mean the guy who kept staring at your chest?
Hey, how 'bout it? You, me, Saturday night?
It's okay, I want this to be your night too. To Monica.
Yes, you got something from the Screen Actor's Guild.
That's great, but shouldn't you be on the toilet right now?
Oh-no, y'know with Gandolf we'd be out all night!
Well, that's pretty much all I'm looking for from these people.
I mean, you were the most beautiful woman in the room tonight!
That's really not the kind of thing we are looking for Zack.
So? What? What? They're gone! Monica's gonna freak!
Well, my apartment isn't there anymore, because I drank it.
Well, what's the deal with these? These-these look nice.
Software that facilitates inter-business networking e-solutions?
That's a little more relaxed than you want them to get.
That thing that I have to do to make a baby. I faked it.
Okay, here you go. I have two queens, what do you have?
Take whatever you want, just please don't hurt me.
No stupid jokes. I thought that was for the actual wedding.
Oooh, Rich is goin' to the party too, huh?
Did you see our bank statement? Can this be right?
Y'know what? You can say goodbye to the tan ones.
Yeah, is this your pretty pink pillow on the couch?
My God! He wants to do it with Phoebe in London!
Honey! That's crazy! I don't want you to get me a stripper...
No-no, I don't think you heard me. Are you ready to party?!
Well, the heart wants what it wants. I'll see you later.
You're right, I have no excuses! I was totally over the line.
I can't call her, I left a message! I have some pride.
See, I'm not bad at this fixing up thing, huh?
Oh really, I didn't know they had foosball in the 1800's.
What kind of scary-ass clowns came to your birthday?
Owen didn't know he was adopted, and Monica told him.
Hey, you know what? Maybe we should keep them here with you.
You got a man who's a nanny...? You got a manny...?
There's no-one around. Why don't we just take this one?
Oh, it's nothing, it's a little thing... I hate that guy.
I have to! Okay? It's time! Okay, I hate dogs.
Did you have a crush on me, when you first met me?
Oh no-no-no I was just squinting. That doesn't mean anything.
Oh the phone! The phone's making sounds! Hello!
Yeah, fine. Fine. Not perfect!! But good enough.
Yeah, I ended up in the storage room, and not alone.
Listen, I'm, I'm sorry I didn't make it over there today.
It is a crime that you and I don't spend more time together.
Dee, the sarcastic sister from Whats Happening.
She gets crazy! This scar is from Pictionary!
That's the magic story you use when you wanna have sex!
Yes you did! You look happy and sick; you smoked!
Emma, how old are you? How old are you today?
Oh no problem, maybe I'll play with my left hand.
Oh yes, somebody just said, "Can you hear anything?"
Joey, if I go first, I wanna be looking for my keys.
I know. You're right. What's it gonna take for you to forgive me?
Don't touch the computer. Don't ever touch the computer.
You know what's not funny? Male Pattern Baldness.
It bodes well for me that speed impresses you.
I'll be a fool for you. I'm sure, you know I don't mind.
I saw you checking me out during the game last night.
Well, listen, this has been great but I'm officially wiped.
Look, you have done enough! Okay? You have to stop this now.
That's why I lost my toe?! Because I called you fat?!
Okay, did you see that?! With the inappropriate and the pinching!!
Why haven't you told them?! Wouldn't they be happy?!
Oh! Look at that, time's up! My turn!
All right look. Penis schmenis. We're all people.
Wow! Why do you want to get rid of her so badly?
But other than that... wholesome, wholesome building.
Sure. You don't really handcuff guys to waterpipes do you?
Come on, it was like cousins having sex up there!
We used them as pillows when we went camping.
Yeah, I believe I was talking to Joey, alright there, Mother-Kisser?
Ah. Your own brand of vigilante justice.
It's okay. Go take the test and see if we're okay.
Weirder than watching his two moms make out?
Honey I... I love your breasts the way they are!
Easy for you to say; you'll be wearing a veil.
Excuse me little one, I have a very solid backhand.
Hey, you just wanna forget about raquetball and hang out here?
And may-maybe we could end up on a boat again?
Y'know that is a popular opinion today I must say.
I suppose that Monica will have the ... manipulative shrew.
Oh yeah! Yeah! Don't worry about me, I'll be fine!
You know, we don't really take advantage of living in the city.
Just tell her the truth! Tell her you're not ready.
Well, you must be pretty mad at yourself right now...!
Were you so late because you were burring this woman?
Here you go. Now stop bringing us pizzas you.
He has sex, and we get hit in our heads.
Right. Right. Well ah, y'know we could flip for it.
You are gonna be a huge star! I'm gonna hug ya!
I don't know, it's these new shoes, they're all slippery.
Well let me think about that, while I remove my pants!
Here we go. Stand up straight. Big smile.
There just don't happen to be any women in our games.
Yeah! You graduated Magma Ku Laude, right?
Dinner is at four, we'll never gonna make it back.
No, I'm not mocking you, or you beautiful guest room.
no I'm not quite sure you got the right movie that's all.
What? Are you kidding? That was like 16 years ago.
Weirdest thing. Did I hear--Mother of God it's true!
So ah, your first sexual experience was with a woman?!
Bob. Bob! Bob!!! What the hell are you doing?!
Okay, now let's decide who has the nicest ass.
Well, gosh. That makes me feel so special and good.
I'm out of words. Should I just say the whole thing again?
Hey, you cry every time somebody talks about Titanic!
I'm not saying it was a good idea, I'm saying I snapped!
Look there is no way you're doing this wedding now. Okay?
No... no! And yet it did. Good-bye, Janice.
I don't see any uh, cabs. Maybe we should just walk?
Okay, well, it's definite, two more weeks of winter.
Oh my God that's it, that's the ring! How much is it?
Why can't we talk in here? With, with, witnesses.
And basically, that's how a bill becomes a law.
Yeah, I'm not gonna pay for those acting classes anymore.
Oh, that's cool. Then I'll just bring them both over.
Twenty percent is a pretty generous tip Joe.
Still terrified, I'll take care of it. No problem.
Hey! This is where your hyper-organized-pain-in-the-ass stuff pays off!
All right, how about we, how 'bout we sell it.
Oh no-no-no-no-no-no, vomit tux! No-no, vomit tux!
Does South Oregon have a sports-team? There you go.
I dunno, aren't there tests for these things, right?
Be right there sweetums. A totally different situation.
Oh it's Bing, sir. I'm sorry , I was just ah...
Well, I guess thats why they call it psychology, sir.
Just so I know, how many more of those can I expect?
A place where no one will ever get out alive?
Well, of course I do! My good friend Joey over here.
Right, right. Sometimes you guys just burst into flames.
It still wouldn't be clean. All I want is my freedom.
I guess. It's always gonna be scary when we have a baby.
I'm sor... Just go. Just go. I can't, I can't.
Are they end to end, or tall like pancakes?
I dunno, but.. I think it's about to attack the Enterprise.
Ya know I think this is much better than the coffee house.
If she asks, I protested a little, but ok!
Y'know what maybe it's gonna be okay, I mean it's been a week.
Hey, there's two messages. These could be from work!
Wow, you're, you're right. I have a horrible, horrible name.
25J and K, any chance those aren't together?
Things sure have changed here on Waltons mountain.
Does anyone else think David Copperfield is cute?
I always knew you were gonna make it. I'm so proud of you.
Is that supposed to be funny! I was really worried over here!
Okay uh, for now, temporarily, you can call me, Clint.
I was just telling Joey about the opening in Fleischman's group.
Yes! Chandler Bing, 7! Chandler Bing, 0.
I just get mad when Rachel doesn't remember where we're going.
Oh relax man, relax. You're looking a little flushed.
This is great! Helen, could you come in here for a moment?
No, had it done to me though. Feels good !
Does this mean we're gonna have to start paying for coffee?
During this time...are you, are you still my best man?
I spent the entire day with you, why didn't you tell me?!
Oh no-no-no, you-yeah, of course you get to be my best man.
Yes, and we'd appreciate it if no one told him yet.
Why are you in here if Joshua is all the way over there?
Well, I-I still think you're very-very nice and very pretty...
Hey, what time is it? The big game is about to start!
Listen, I've got a secret for ya. I let him win.
No. I'm not letting you or anybody else see, ever.
Are you sure he's gonna be able to crack that code?
She went on one of those spray-on tan places.
Sense the tone! No that kid Nate got it.
You know, I'm not sure a sports team is the way to go.
Phoebe Buffay In Buffay The Vampire Layer.
Yeah, this more than anything else, is the staging area.
Okay, everybody stay here. I will find out what's going on.
That's a mailman! That's our mailman! Hi. How are ya?
Just not enough to put us in the original wedding party.
Oh, why not. Was I doing anything particularly... saucy?
No! That was a lie! See how easy that was?
So, are you guys in the movie, or are you just really paranoid.
Yeah, you got me. I'm out five big ones! Here you go.
Okay, we have our stripper. A miss Crystal Chandelier.
You ah, you have, you have to leave, now? How come?
What if Mary-Angela comes to the door and I ask for Mary-Angela?
Yeah! Why don't you stick around. You can sit right there.
Wax the door shut, we're never leaving, ever.
Guys, guys, I've got great news! Guess what.
Believe me, I've been saying that for years. Oh my God!
Yeah, but Sebastian? What is that? A cat's name?
I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done.
Y'know what, I'm gonna uh, play the field just a little more.
Okay. Holy double-vented comfort Batman! What's this?
Great, at a hundred dollars an apple, we're there!
She's right, you shouldn't have bought tickets just for us ...
The cameras? Remember last night I told you to take them?
All right, let's play one more hand! One more!
Actually, I think this apartment sullies the good name of crap
Well, I think you need to come out of your shell just a little.
Yes, Gunther, can I get two cups of chino, please?
So Rachel's all moved out huh? How are you taking it?
Yeah. So do we need to hug here or. . .
I don't think the contestants are supposed to speak to each other.
I have to; he's my best friend, and you're seeing him.
That old woman was being scammed by her mechanic.
No, you don't have to, and you can't because I, I live here too.
Well, never say never but y'know probably uh yeah, never.
Tonight? You-you didn't say it was going to be at nighttime.
You kissed my best Ross! ...Or something to that effect.
Okay! Now you stay out here, and you think about what you did!!
Just out of curiosity did she tell you how you're gonna go?
I never sucked, I actually didn't want you to know how good I was!
My Grandmother used to say that exact same thing to me.
Oh, come on! I don't care! Come on! Whose is it?
I know that one! ...No, that's Popes into a Volkswagen.
Yes, if the presents are hidden south for the winter.
Honey, she keeps canceling on us, take the hint.
Well, how could anyone not be in love with Yasmine Blepe?
What is the point of having them if we never use them?
Wow, y'know when you say it, it doesn't sound so scary.
It's seven years ago. My time machine works!
Noo! Oh, it's okay, it's okay, baby, baby, baby.
Oh yes you can. You just make the faces and the noises.
So what do you say, maybe sometime I hold your gun?
Oh, I am no women, but that is one tasty dish.
Well, maybe I won't kiss you, and then you'll have to stay.
Okay, so what name am I cool enough to pull off?
Man, we're gonna rock that Asian student union!
Well, you're not gonna believe this, but if you have seven minutes...
Yeah? I hope you're not thinking about cleaning the living room.
Top of the world? Dock of the bay? I'm out.
Oh, that's good. Maybe he'll hear you and pull the cord.
What's wrong? What's wrong? You're married that's what's wrong.
Ah, Sliced Bread, a wonderful Lady MacBeth.
This teramisu is, is excellent. Did you make it Mary-Angela?
What's this in my pocket? Why it's Joey's porno movie.
Great! Now, the score is 7 to almost 7.
"So how does it feel knowing you're about to die?"
Well, Monica and Chandler can't go. We're going to dinner remember?!
Yes, yes it is, short story, that I was writing.
Yes, and this with the cigarette butt in it, is that decaf?
Well, that is what happened, and I don't even see you denying this!
Yes! I've-I've never seen a roll like this in my life!
Yeah. We don't feel like we can host Thanksgiving this year.
Wait! Wait! We'd really love it if you could be there.
I could use the money; it could give me time to write.
Yeah, well, I guess you don't need my help Victor Victoria!
I'm a little bit uncomfortable with the that way you express yourself.
Oh, you're definately not. I haven't cried like that in years.
New haircut? Necklace? Dress? Boots? Boots!
I'm sorry buddy, but I don't think I'm gonna be able to make it.
That is funny. It was also funny when I made it up.
That's a bad duck!!! How'd the thing go tonight, Ross?
Are you sure you weren't looking at your hands in a mirror?
No! Look, I don't cry! It's not a big deal! Okay?!
This is so sad. I mean, I only have like ten pins.
Y'know what, I think this might be one of the times he's wrong.
You see you can't tell which one is which either, dwha!!
Hey, guys, it's after midnight, merry Christmas everyone.
If can invade Poland, there isn't anything I can't do.
And you're upset because you didn't make your best friend cry?
"Wanted. Female roommate, non-smoker, non-ugly." Nice!
And this from the cry-for-help department. Are you wearing makeup?
There are snow cones! Snow cones! Yuck!
Okay, open ours next. Open ours next!
No, no, Phoebs. You know why? Cause he's dead.
So um, how come you guys haven't talked about this before?
Can we read it? Can you print out another copy?
Well, I'm gonna get another espresso. Can I get you another latte?
Have you figured out what started the fire Mr. Fireman?
Go and tell Rachel right now before Ross finds out.
Yes it is! From now on, I have no first name.
Uch, do you think, Monica is gonna be able smell it?
No-no-no-no, if we let her stay, she will stay forever!
Uh, let's see... Alvin... Simon... Theodore.... no.
Y'know what I just realized? You just freaked out about our relationship.
Wow that was my scariest voice! You're very brave.
Hi, I'm Chandler, and I have no idea who Dorothy is.
No. When it comes to sweets, he's surprisingly strict.
You were not supposed to hear that! I said that behind you back!
I'm in the bathroom, can you come in here? I think there's something wrong.
No. We were in the middle of sex...and you fell asleep.
I'll try to stop. Wait, did you say until the sixth?
You know that thing, when you and I talk to each other about things?
As in Barbara Streisand's husband James Brolin?
OK, I was wrong, that's what they used to cover Connecticut.
Hey-hey! I thought Naked Thursday's was just our thing man!
...in you, my endless love. My endless love.
I snapped, okay? I couldn't handle the pressure and I snapped.
Ross is smart and funny, d'you ever think that about him?
Oh, I'm glad you guys are past that little awkward phase.
Horrifying? Scarring? Something people go to jail for?
So, just the ones gave back to us and we had framed!
He's coming into the audience. He's coming into the audience.
Really?! Joe? What would you do if you were in Ross's situation?
You do know, I can just turn them the other way around, right?
I don't know R.G., I was thinking something girlie for your office.
Okay. What if we lived together and you understand what I'm saying?
And I'll be using his dead body as a shield.
Hey, come on, we got the gift, the concert, and the cake.
It's like 'Night of the Living Dead Christmas Trees.'
Oh no-no-no, Monica would freak. But to hell with that bitch.
Hey, relax I just need more time. We're going to dinner tonight.
Well, as long as the pilgrims didn't eat it, I'm in.
All right, but I should warn you, I'm not going. I'm going.
The sheer volume, it was like flying with the Riddler!
Because I'm very happy for him! And you, you lucky dog!
You-you-you didn't know that. Well, I guess my work here is done!
She's shhing me! It's my phone and she's shhing me!
Hey, look at this. "My Big Book of Grievances."
Oh-ho, it'll be back. Oh-ho, there's nobody in the room.
That would be a lot more convincing if you weren't drooling.
Uh, four, a boy, twin girls and another boy.
Oh really?! You think you're stronger? Why don't you prove it?
Okay Ross has the cameras, has he checked out yet?
Someone I don't know sent me an e-mail and I opened it.
Make sure you put all that stuff back in the closet, okay?
You know what? I'm not gonna end up like this. I'll see you man.
Okay, so, I'm in Las Vegas... I'm Liza Minelli-
You know, it's very hard to take you seriously when you look like that.
Hey. Soaps? Shampoos? Are you really taking all this stuff?
You'll have to pardon my roommate, he wanted to marry this.
No! No-no-no-no-no-no. It sounds like they really need you down there.
Y'know when we move in together, can I get a gumball machine?
Okay, two, three years of rent, utilities, food...
Well, have you guys made anything that maybe I can take credit for?
Yeah, Monica doesn't like that either, Maybe I should stop doing that.
Well, aren't we Mr. "The glass is half empty."
Look at Officer Ross riding back here with the visitors.
Don't look honey. Change the channel! Change the channel!
Okay, okay, so we get to take that stupid troll thing home!
So-If you wear that you'll make mine less special.
That's a lie, you went to the game, I can see Joey's hand.
Doesn't know, "Hello." But she knows Capricorn One.
Op, y'know what though, it's kind've a girlie briefcase.
Who are you? Ansel Adams?! Get outta here!
I turned it off. Mother of God, I turned it off!
Did they teach you that in your anger management class?
Hey, Ben, remember us? Ok, the mole came off.
Okay y'know what, because you said that, I'm not putting out tonight.
Yeah I'm not having an affair. Nancy is our realtor.
No. No. Actually I forgot, what is the deal with that again?
Alright, I hope you realize you're not getting these underpants back.
Well, bye Mon, bye Ross, Rachel, bye Emma!
Julie hi! Chandler Bing, I, I guess you remember me.
Oh, yeah! These are the faces of two people in the know!
You're not, what do you, what do you got a bionic foot?
With the balled-up socks? I figured you taught him that.
Oh, give her the deposit! Give her the ring! I don't care!
Hey! Babe! Aren't you excited we're going on our honeymoon?
I am really sorry. That is so terrible. I am so, so sorry.
Yes we're all in here and we would love for you to join us!
You actually think that something can happen between Emily and Susan?
Four different women! I've had sex way more times!
You roll another hard eight and we get married here tonight.
Hey, guys! Come on! You gotta see what Emma just did.
Oh really? Then how come no one here is wearing them?
This sounds like a hernia. You have to-you-you go to the doctor!
Sure, you guys don't have this problem, you're made of wood. Hey!
You know you don't want me to help. You can't have it both ways!
You're right, by saying "nice" I'm virtually licking her.
Because it's complicated, it's complex- Hey, you kissed my mom!
Well she, she wouldn't do that, she's with, she's with me.
What if they're not? What if it's adopted by a king?
Well, I didn't know how to tell you before, but... We got the house.
Damn! The tailpipe's not hot enough to light this!
Would you like me to write her a little poem as well?
Don't say that. Don't tangle the dream and take it away.
Oh, don't say that! Don't say that. That's not true. Is it?
Ok, I don't care what you guys say, something's bothering her.
Okay. "So. Whaddya want from me, Damone, huh?"
Good, God's speed, good people! You're not gonna go?
Did I teach her that? Did I just... impart wisdom?
He can do more than that! He can destroy the universe!
You're right, it has been you dream for over 15 seconds.
Well, y'know, most women would kill for three guys like us.
Oh, I don't know man. I haven't talked to her in like ten years.
Please God don't let it be Kung Pow Chicken.
You're welcome. Hey Joey, thanks for parking the car .
Well, I'm so confused as to what we've been doing so far...
Yes, the doctors say if they remove it, he'll die.
And they don't like it when you explain why your jokes are funny.
What?! It's not right! We're not ready to have a kid now!!
Which is why geese are so relaxed this time of year.
You mean that Portuguese couple? Yeah, like you wouldn't have done it.
Ho-ho, so hard we had to throw out your underwear again?
HA-HA! All you got was Monica's stinky Brussels sprouts!
For the last time no! Get out! Get out, Joey!
By the way, this didn't seem so dorky in the hall.
Well, instead of just hanging out, we figure we'd do nothing.
Oh really? Uh, Monica said she had a date at 9:00.
But I made you a tape of what I think are all romantic songs.
Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian... Did I say that out loud?
When I walk outside naked people throw garbage at me.
So, how's the hideously inappropriate crush on Rachel coming?
Oh, I will. But I will need a mirror... as he is me!
Yes! Two thousand dollars exactly! How do you know that!
Ross, don't press send, don't press se... !
Yes. Yes! Right! And I feel horrible. You have to believe me!
Hey! Wow! You look great! Wanna move in with me tomorrow?
I might have checked to see if I was ovulating a couple times.
Ah, you're still just a little fat girl inside aren't you?
I also want you to remember that I let you live here rent free!
Okay, if you see a little version of me in there? Kill it!
And don't get me started on the way that people from Tulsa talk.
So in your whole life, you've only been with one oh.
No! In his office! How many kisses were there?
Yeah, I wanted to make a dramatic scene, but I hate packing.
That's sweet, honey, but save something for the adoption Lady.
That was one of the worse things ever. And not just on TV.
Yeah, that's the same as "it has something to do with wind".
Joey, we would've asked you, we just thought you wouldn't be interested.
I was not trying them out, Susie asked me to wear them.
Oh, I just went for a walk, around the living room. Whatever...
Why would I kiss a girl, and then put her on your bed?
Yes, but, Ross you chose a career of talking about dinosaurs.
Y'know those big-big uh, road signs that say "Merge?"
Yeah, you don't want to be stuck with us for the next five weeks.
Yeah. Well, I think our second fight is going to be a big one!
Wow! Really?! We get all this rusty crap for free?!
Petrie, right, right. Okay, some people gonna be working this weekend.
So I laugh at my boss's jokes, what's the big deal?
Well that's the brilliance of it. The pretty people... and the running.
Well, no, actually she uh, asked me if I wanted to get a drink.
So he has to be a male who has at least $50.
Look, you don't have to draw an actual wo-whoa! She's hot!
Yeah, come with us. You'll see how close it is to the city.
Oh, uh, well, I haven't seem it but if I do I'll let you know.
Why don't you use ours across the hall, 'cause she...has...problems.
Yes! Way to go, man! Still got the egg, huh?
Are there no conscious men in the city for you two?
Yeah, I mean, it would be rude to them for us to leave now.
There is nothing like the support of your loving wife, huh?
Can somebody else hug him? I have to stay by the window.
Okay, for the last time. It's not named for each individual man.
Ok, I'm makin' a break for it, I'm goin' out the window.
Oh, that's fine! Go with your instincts, go with your instincts.
Nude... ... pictures of Anna Kournikova. I'm so sorry.
Yes there are, I just saw them a few minutes ago.
Ground control to Major Tom! Commencing countdown...engines...on!
I can see it from right here. It'll cost you one husband.
Bye bye Mike!/Cya mike!/Bye mike!/Bye bye now!
When I was growing up I...played the one on the far left.
Dude, don't rub my face in your crazy single life!
Sure. And listen, thanks for doing that for us, by the way.
Why are you napping over here instead of over at your place?
Wait a minute, all jokes aside? I didn't agree to that!
I don't think of her that way, you know, she's a, she's a colleague.
All right, hold on! If you win, we give up the birds.
Wow, I don't know what to say. Wow, I, I don't know what to say.
Y'know, if you're gonna work late, I could look in on him for you.
What does a guy have to do to be taken seriously around here?!
Well, you're not suggesting that we spend all of the money on the wedding?
Hey-hey-hey. So what happened? A forest tick you off?
Well, I'm sorry if my friends aren't as sophisticated as yours.
Oh I'm sorry, you're kicking me out of my own living room?
Wait a minute, hold the phone! You're not Elizabeth's dad?!
Oh y'know what, I was already trying to trade for ah, well, you.
Maybe it was his sister's. You know, maybe it was his daughter's.
I confronted her, and she didn't deny it! I don't live here!
Oh yeah, Dana Keystone. She was in my Movement class.
Ok. Ok. Having a phone has finally paid off.
Oh, Richard. That's all I ever hear, Richard, Richard, Richard!
Oh yeah, me too. Y'know if this shirt is dirty. Yep.
No! I want a flabby gut and saggy man breasts!
Oh, yeah, sure, it's not mine anyway. It can with the pants.
No, the thing was, we were gonna go see Hootie and the Blowfish.
Yes, as a matter of fact he did, so I can't let you go.
That's right. You're husband's home. So, now the sex can stop.
Well yeah, in that it's not being used and I... have it to spare.
He's right. Nobody's gonna benefit, and you're just gonna hurt her.
"The phone. Bringing you closer to people...who have phones."
Oh no-no-no, no more offers. You can't offer anything to us!
Gap commercial. So did you book them? Did you call?
That is funny, maybe for my birthday she'll murder someone.
Eldad, sit down. Move over! Move over now!
Forgive me? You haven't been taking my calls in a week!
Oh, well then, if anybody should have a party it should be him.
I'd love to stay, but I have eh... got a hot date...
Okay, but don't touch it, because you fingers have destructive oils.
Okay. I've been thinking about it too, and I, I think we're ready.
Is that why you became a chef? So that people would like you?
Alright look Ross I'll give you 50 dollars for your underpants.
Well, y'know I'm 29. I mean who needs a savings account.
Oh, and Sheena Easton. But we probably couldn't get her anyway.
Yeah. It's a shame you two didn't get to spend more time together.
Then put out fire by peeing, no get invited back.
Oh yeah, that sounds great. Oh, and listen, it's, it's gonna be....
Well, here we are, just a bunch of thirty year olds.
Because then we would be the guys who turned off free porn.
That's the thing, see I would like to stay in the pribe of mwha-ah-libe.
No. Is there anyway, anyway you think he'll understand this?
Well, you're welcome. And tell them we're really glad they're coming.
Okay, make sure you look both ways before you cross the street.
Uhh, a T-shirt that says, "I don't belong here."
So ah, Joey tells me you two met in acting class.
So when you said, "Get up early," did you mean 1986?
But this is eleven. It's almost twice as hard up here.
Chandler, Chandler Bing. I'm not gay, I'm not gay at all.
I know it sounds really weird, but we're just so bad at relationships.
Four hours? You guys have been doing this for four hours?
Do you even remember which part of the wall is not spackle?
Y'know I am the groom right? I was told it was kinda big deal.
Okay, you know how that people say that Tulsa is the Paris of Oklahoma?
Forty-five minutes? We have tickets to the Musicman at 8:00.
Okay, no problem, just remember to wake us up before you go-go.
Jeannie, the head of east coast operations Jeannie?
Hey Mon, I think I figured out whose handcuffs they are.
Okay I promise. I'll-I'll hate it. Wow! You-you look...hideous.
Hey Rach! There she is...My perfectly proportioned wife.
No I don't! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
A cool phone number, and a possible name for the kid.
There's a beautiful woman at eight, nine, ten o'clock!
Shhhh! Shhhhh! Shhhhh! Shhhhh! I can't, I can't hear you.
Oh, you do? Because she said you guys havent talked in like years.
I just want you to know that what you witnessed in there, that wasn't for fun.
Well I mean, let me get the door first. Oh, hi! No one.
Is it me, or have the greetings gone downhill around here?
Because... that way... we can pick up where we left off.
Yes you can. You're thinking about time, you can't go back in time.
Ooh, not so tight... I'm sorry, just give me one more chance.
Hey Joe! How's the second draft of the letter coming?
Yeah, and I-I gave first names to all of the foosball players.
If this is the way all the Gellers flirt, we don't have a problem.
Right, because it's fast. Because, it's so fast. It's fast!
So, has anyone talked to Dr. and Mrs. Geller yet?
Here you go Phoebe! Here you go Phobo! Phewbedo! Phaybobo.
In my defense, it was dark and he was a very pretty guy.
Plus I thought the baby would be in good hands with a doctor!
Ya know, my cousin went to hell on a football scholarship.
Hey, I hear what your saying, okay? And, thanks for the warning.
It must be a virus. I think it erased your hard drive.
Hey, come on, give me a break, I'm out on a limb here.
What honey, it's like fifteen blocks to the subway. Let's go.
So, ahh, how are ya? How ya...How ya... You okay?
So great things are happening at work and in your personal life!
Yeah I know, but I was really confused and then I talked to these guys.
And it's not as if you have a boyfriend's shoulder to cry on.
No. No, I just think that maybe I-I'd heard it somewhere before.
Honey, we've been over this. I need to be facing the other way.
Well, I guess there's nothing left for us to do but-but kiss.
No, no, see? See? Hey, it's printing. Hey, it's printing!
No, no, I'm just looking for a man to draw on me with chalk.
Okay, so how bummed were you when the second sister died huh?
Nope! Because I'm not your boyfriend. Hey Pheebs, how did it go?
Well, I can't say "hump" or "screw" in front of the B-A-B-Y.
Go change! She doesn't want her parents to know she's drunk.
Y'know, I would be offended, but Monica is freakishly strong, so...
I invented the game of Cups as a way to give Joey money.
Cheese, it's smelly. You must smell a lot of the time too.
He's being silly, because he knows that we enjoy the silliness!
Well, at least the perfume is not mine, be thankful for that!
Okay, we have to talk. I'm just getting out of a very serious relationship...
Oh, I wish I'd know you were going to do that, I ordered Chinese.
Joey, I uh! I can't believe this is how I'm spending my anniversary.
Hey, do you want this done quick, or do you want this done right?
Listen, I have to, uh, um, I have to, I have to confess something.
It's wrong. They made a mistake. They think we're somebody else.
Would you put that back on?! Monica's gonna be here any minute!
It's just that we've never spent any time, you know, alone together.
Oh, y'know what, I'm gonna be okay, you don't have to throw a party for me.
Not like that, I won't! Kip would have liked the birds!
I know what you're thinking, Dave Thomas, founder of Wendy's.
Are we greeting each other this way now? 'Cause I like that.
God! She is not stealing from us! Okay, will you let this go?
I can't believe her! Did she tell you we were having money problems?
For a minute there I thought you were actually tryin' to smell something.
Okay. You won't believe what Monica's older brother just said to me!
If you get this one, we buy everybody here a steak dinner!
Honey, you've been in there for a long time... Is everything okay?
Hang on, she's right here. Someone's on the phone, for ya.
Well I was... I was exactly expecting company after... 9:15.
Because that's the only part of you he can see when he's on the table!
I'm sorry, I thought you were Joey's other grandmother. I've done it again.
No, no no no. You'll be fine. Hillary's bind, right?
Soo, ah, Eric, what kind of photography do ya do?
Honey, I got us that room at the Woodford Inn this weekend.
All right. I've got a plan. I'll go down the fire escape.
Actually Pheebs its more of a husband and wife kinda thing.
Yes. When Monica and I were in London, we were both in London.
She was working on Valentine's Day so we're celebrating it tonight.
Yes, but the batteries... Chandler: Thank you, thank you very much!
Ok, pure evil, horny and alone. I've done this.
You can call off the roommate search! Hi! I'll be living here.
Y'know what, I'm, I'm gonna spend some alone time with the pen.
Oh uh, as it turns out, we can't do it. Monica has to work.
She guessed 8, 9, based on his drawings.
Oh come on man! At least let me finish this last one.
All right, but you can't use that again for a whole year. I'm in.
See my friend-my friend, Rachel, she wants to be set up.
Wait! I just want you to know that... I'm so happy you're going to be here.
That's why our honeymoon photos look like me and Diana Ross!
My chair. Now, if anybody asks, your name is Rosita!
I'll tell you what, I will go get them developed and you can go home.
No, we'll-we'll bring it back! Just put it under your dress.
Unless Snoopy says it to Charlie Brown, I think we're okay.
I'm sorry. That's the one thing I can't do. I promised I'd be with Monica.
Excuse me. . That didn't make us sound gay at all!
Right. So, it'll be the same except... less sex with you.
Well you should meet my uncle, Bada. I'll let myself out.
I majored in lightning rounds. All right, we're gonna destroy you.
Okay, worst case scenario. Say you never feel like a father.
I thought I broke Joey's chair! That's why I replaced it with mine!
And then the peacock bit me. Please kiss me at midnight.
We have to bust it open, but neither of us can do it!
You don't think we'd buy a house and not have a Joey room do you?
Oh, we had a lot of liquor left over from the Christmas party.
I want to say you but, that seems like such an easy answer.
Well, you can't just not see Rachel anymore, she's one of your best friends.
Well, maybe it's a contest, y'know? Like, collect all five?
All right, let's break this down. What exactly did he say to you?
No bunny at all!! Always no bunny at all!!!
You'd think that would embarrass me, but you see I'm maxed out.
I'm just trying to help you out! Okay? I wanna make sure that you're okay.
No! No, she didn't say that. I-I-I think you should talk to Monica now.
So uh Monica, do you, do you like the Law & Order?
That all the pieces of my life are falling right into place!
So you...you don't want to live with Don in a cheese house?
Okay, you get her in here. You bolt the door. I'll be in the closet.
You got it! Here we go! Come on! This is great! Ahhh!
Because uh...we-we...we split up. Monica and I split up. Hold me.
I'm tellin' you, she leaned back, I could see her brain.
If only there was something in your head to control the things you say.
Well I think it's safe to say that our friendship is effectively ruined.
Yeah, but it was like a million years ago, so it doesn't matter.
I thought you said those jokes were funny. Joke! Joke! Joke!
Wha- wh- why, why, why does he suspect that?
Ah-ha, you're not the boss of me. Yeah, you are! Ooh, saucy.
Now I know it's been awhile, but I took it as a good sign.
Get in here! Hey, and you can not smoke in here! Merry Christmas.
Are you kidding? Okay, I'll give you a hint; I'll give you a hint.
Yes, but you ended up having sex with both of them that afternoon.
Yeah o-, OK, alright. Doesn't matter, time for Baywatch.
No, we're just four people with neck problems. You talk like this.
I'm not sure what they did, but I'm inclined to blame Enron.
Because she's not eleven! And it's not the seventh night of Hanukkah!
Ho, ho, ho, holy crap is it hot in here!
Do you think I work at some kind of boot pricing company?
It's not a big deal. It's, just it's right here, and it's all the time.
Hi. Okay, you're too late okay? Because she's already with our guy.
I can't remember the last time I got a girl to take care of my monkey.
Damn. My mail order grandfather hasn't come yet.
Yeah-yeah, so big that it actually makes our doors look smaller!
Great! Now, we can go to the Ranger game! Last night!
Oh you wouldn't uh, care. It's just a stupid comic book story.
It can't happen like this. Okay? I'll meet you back at the hotel.
Muskogee! That's like four hours from Tulsa. Woo hoo!
That sounds good. I'll call you- or you call me, whatever...
Should we go make a baby right now before you change your mind?
Well I didn't think that was serious. Ya know I thought that was just a fight.
And the inventor of the door rests happily in his grave.
Oh, thanks, but I think she'd feel like we're gangin' up on her.
Yes, if it really doesn't mean anything, because you know that I'm just not ready...
Now that I untangled you, how 'bout you doing a little something for me?
I am sorry I am late. You'll understand when you'll see Joey.
They look great! Does your boyfriend have the best taste or what?
Yeah! Sure, sure. So, what was going on with you today? Oh-oh-oh!
I couldn't say that I was naked because she's allowed too see me naked.
Stunning entertainment center. Fine, fine Italian craftsmanship.
Okay, but you gotta push past this because it is about to get so good!
That sounds more fun than the thing we were going to do in Vermont!
There's this thing I really want us to do. I read about it in Maxim...
No, I don't want to tell anybody else because I don't want Monica to find out.
A freakish thin date with a hanger for her head?
What d'ya know... It's a treat for the eyes and the ears.
What must it be like not to be crippled by fear and self-loathing.
Ya know there isn't a part of that sentence I don't need explained.
Hey! Honey, can I ask you a question about the Valentine's Day gifts?
Well, our names really are Monica and Chandler. We're from New York.
Just for a few seconds, so I can know what it is... Please?
This is the way that I find out. Most moms use the phone.
Alright, the truth is, I soiled myself during some turbulences.
She is gonna recognize that I did a nice thing and-and, appreciate it.
Whoho ho... Listen to the judgement from the porn star!
Oh, and you know whose knowledge of her ex-boyfriend is shocking? Monica!
Yeah, about 300 guys I went to high school with. Yeah, thanks.
I mean, especially considering how tough it's been for you to find work.
Why, it's six tickets to Hootie and the Blowfish! The Blowfish!
Nothing, just your overcoat sounds remarkably like Brent Mussberger.
Should I use my invisibility to fight crime or for evil?
Well, you couldn't have looked everywhere or else you would've found her!
Oh, it would be you! You! Monica! And you'd get all the votes!
Is this the best way to use one of your three magic wishes?
Life-sized Imperial Storm Troopers from Sharper Image?
Well, what did you think, that-that elves came in and fixed it?
Okay, I'll give them back. Look! What is so great about that sandwich?
Why? Wh- wh- why is Mr. Douglas looking for me?
Mmmm. Not tonight, honey. I got an early day tomorrow.
I'm trppd... in an ATM vstbl... wth Jll Gdcr!
What, no, "Nice apartment, I bet the bedrooms are huge?"
All right. Look, I'm gonna go in here, and you don't buy me anything ever.
Oh my God! That is so not the opposite of taking somebody's underwear!!
Y'know, I don't know why you're so embarrassed, they were very nice boobies.
Okay, something to cover the smell ... Oven cleaner! Unscented!
Kip, my old roommate, y'know we all used to hang out together.
So, what does the other guy do? Does he go to college too?
Luckily, the guy she settled for can't hear what you're talking about.
I dunno what it is, it just doesn't quite feel like Christmas to me.
DO NOT DISTURB DO NOT DISTURB! Monica:
Yeah, I can say that I have a conference and you can say you have a chef thing.
Well that's good. Because you didn't! And I'm incredibly happy for ya!!
Yeah, we could do that without y'know risking our lives at all!
I climb down the fire escape and you can't put that in the closet?
No, I prefer to keep a safe distance from all this merriment.
Monica, it's 6:30 in the morning. We're not working out, it's over.
Oh, just like I said. That crazy... Bert... roaming the halls.
Oh, come on. I can never get a girl like that with conventional methods.
Joey, you have to tell her what's going on! And what did it look like?!
Okay. Okay. All right. Help! Am I a Mark, or a John?
So if Monica's not around, then I'm not good enough to raise Emma?
Oh, she's regional Vice President; She's... just below me.
That would be impossible to resist if you weren't all drippy here.
Honey, I know you're in pain right now, but I'm a little turned on.
Well you see in Cups, once you get $700, you have to double it.
Umm, so this Aunt Marilyn is-is-is-is she coming to the wedding?
Kinda... you know, sneaking around, having to hide from you guys...
Nice camoflauge man, for a minute there I almost didn't see ya.
All right, I'm gonna do it! I'm gonna get shot down. Any advice?
Oh, is it on the computer, cuz I'd love to give it a read...?
Damn those robots, they're supposed to be our faithful servants!
I'm trppd... in an ATM vstbl... wth JLL GDCR.
Honey, it's not the bath I enjoy, it's the wet, naked lady.
At least he died doing what he loved... watching blimps.
Listen ah, Joe, I-I need to, I need to talk to you about something.
And I will cook anything you want in here , and do anything in there!
That's not true. I came with Monica and I'm leaving with Weird Al.
Right, calm down, O'Mally. I'll slip him some money.
Yes, but there's two in martini, soo everybody back to my office.
Hey, this isn't like swimming after you eat, pick up the phone!!
I didn't mean that. I just meant that the apartment is worth so much more.
Oh, I'm sorry, am I getting in the way of all the room switching fun?
All right, I suppose I can wait a day. Hey, what are you doing Friday?
Don't touch the phone! I'll get it, I'll get it, I'll get it!!
Well, it's like that old saying, have some sex, eat some cake.
So we thought we'd throw you little going away party around seven.
That was in the fourth grade. How could you still be upset about that?
Well, you want me to uh, clench anything, or-... Susie? Susie.
Hey, look at this! They're lighting the big Christmas tree tonight.
Ohh that's the worse thing that can happen on an anniversary ever!
It's all very, very good. So you wanna go uh, mix it up?
Ok well, thanks, you won't regret it. I'll see you tomorrow .
She's an FBI agent, posing as a beauty contestant.
Yeah, we played, we watched TV.. that juggling thing is amazing.
Yes!! I love you! I can't even remember what we were fighting about!
Really? So, you're gonna stick with this 'it's all for her' thing?
Y'know I rued the day once...didn't get a whole lot else done.
I want to. I love her so much, but I'm afr...It's too huge.
I was looking forward to playing basketball, but I guess that's out the window.
Wow, that's lucky. What if her name was Big Ugly Splotch?
Ha-ha-ha. A little to hard. What am I not ah, boyfriend material?
And those guys were this close to lettin' us play this time too.
Because you kept talking to him while he was trying to go to the bathroom?!
Me! I do that. So... Seriously, do I look okay? I'm little nervous.
Yes! Good thing we have that, 'Not in New York' rule.
See, it pays to know the man who wears my shoes. Me.
What? No, I'm taking Monica to a romantic inn in Vermont !
Okay, I guess we can lose to junior high girls some other time.
Okay! Okay! Okay! You win! You win!! I can't have sex with ya!
So, you heard it, you repeated it, so that must mean you wrote it.
That's why for an entire year people called me Sir Limps-A-Lot?!
Hi! Hi! You're crazy! Okay? This is Emily. Emily is straight.
Buy stamps, pick up dry cleaning...Don't let Phoebe in.
It's funny. When you said "unpaid" it sounded like you said "unpaid."
Oh, thanks! I'm... actually thinking about becoming a motivational speaker.
Hey! Monica can be cool and fun at organized indoor projects!
Joey kicked me out of the car on the George Washington bridge!
This is so bad. If-if you're not Mary-Angela, then-then who is?
I did break up with her! She just took it really, really well!
Listen, Phoebs, this is gonna be OK. Ross, Russ. Russ, Ross.
God, it's great to catch up! I can't believe how long it's been!
So, ahh, what kind of powers would Gold Man have?
Well next time ask! Or at least wait for me to ask!
Interesting, cause in my dreams, I'm allways surprisingly inadequate.
Pheebs you didn't have to get us anything for our wedding you already sang...
Ooh! Yes! Okay! Here's what we do, we-we forget it happened.
That's funny. Does it-does it hurt? Does the labor hurt?
Nope! Every once and a while I just scream stuff at the TV.
Joey, be a pal. Lift up my hand and smack her with it.
That's a good idea. I wonder where I could get a basket of porn...
I also got this great salt and pepper shaker from the restaurant.
Ya know if you want to, I can just hold them down and you could .
Ok, but can you tell him that, because he thinks he's too pink.
Clearly I did not start drinking enough at the start of the meal.
Ok, so it's just because it was my table, I have to buy a new one?
Oh, uhm... I have to work too. Yeah, I'm stuck at the office all day.
Someone on the subway licked my neck! Licked my neck!!
Yes it was very sad when the guy stopped drawing the deer!
Hey, look, I know what it is to be a friend, I just-I just screwed up!
Well, I'll tell ya I do enjoy guilt, but, ah, it wasn't me.
I'm just saying that sometimes we like to do stuff that costs a little more.
Yeah, Joey just pressed something on the remote and it just, came on!
Uh, Joey's having an embolism, but I'd go for a Nip, y'know?
Richard! No one supposed to know about us! See I, did it again.
Ok, who wants light cheese, and who wants dark cheese?
But we are not the one she chose! How can you feel okay about this?
I could perform an operation on you and prove it if you'd like.
I think this is probably why Damone smokes in his cell alone.
Honey why am I watching a bunch of sharks swimming around.
Uhm, thank you, but we're really trying not to get our hopes up.
Monica has a secret closet and she won't let me see what's in it.
Eleven days before Halloween.. all the good costumes are gone?
Yeah, I'm gonna pass. 'Cause I was kinda iffy when it was puppies.
Y'know what? It seems like all of the sudden; so much has happened.
That's funny, this conversation's how I got the bullet hole in my head.
No, Beth doesn't die, she doesn't die. Does she Rachel?
What would you give to a kid if he wanted a ticket to play with?
His legs flail about as if independent of his body!
Hey! Look I brought a friend for dinner, this is Zack, from work!
So, Joey on Law & Order, you must be very proud!
Because he thinks I slept with his ex-girlfriend and killed his fish.
Love her! That's right, I...LOVE...HER!!! I love her!! I love you, Monica.
The big deal is I was sitting there last, so, that's my seat.
Lowell? Financial Services' Lowell, that's who you saw me with?
Nothing! It's over! Dammit! This is regularly scheduled programming!
Okay, easy Martina. I think we should let them win the next game.
Yeah, now how's that going though? Are you okay with the not-flirting thing?
Any chance you are trying to pick a fight to make all this easier?
Yeah, and someday when you're ready, you'll make it past the hedges.
Does he say that before he sticks his thermometer in your touchy?
All right, so you're telling me that I have to tell racist jokes now?!
Oh, that's The Wedding March. Does, does that freak you out?
Is it okay that I want you to wear that head set in bed tonight?
Because if I go home, we're gonna become the Bings! I can't be the Bings!
So, a lot of malfunctioning wee-wees and hoo-hoos in this room, huh?
Well good, good for you. You really think that Roger is the perfect guy?
Yeah. I feel so bad. Is there anything I can do to make it up to you?
Well, I have kissed over four women. Do you wanna get under the covers?
Pulling flowers out it makes the bag look a lot more masculine.
I was surprised to see a kangaroo in a World War I epic.
Nothing happened? Nothing? So you didn't tell my girlfriend that you love her?
Oh what is it honey, you need some tea? Some soup? Oh-ohhhh!
And she's... turning on the TV... and watching... Miss Congeniality!
Okay, y'know, we-we're safe right? I mean nothing bad can go down!
Pheebs, if she could come back as a couch, we'd really appreciate it.
Look, we're not just messing around! I love her. Okay, I'm in love with her.
That is so not... That is so not... That... Oh, shut up!
So, what are you doing here? I thought tonight was your big anniversary dinner.
Oh, yeah, well, poor Richard. Y'... I can grow a moustache!
See, that's why I could never be an actor. Because I can't say gig.
Carol? I was just wondering if Joey could ask you a question about breast-feeding?
Yes, I believe we can expect a call from the President any moment now.
Absolutely! Y'know, because touchie can mean both ass and good worker.
Please, don't take away my cool thing. Please?! Pretty please?!
That's right! It was the wrong kind of eight, no wedding! Damnit!
Nothing, just a little extra air in my mouth. Pffft. Pffffffft.
Y'know I'm-I'm really glad we decided not to sleep together before the wedding.
I believe in tall, handsome strangers who hit on my wife!
I don't know. I can't tell, what ever it was went back in too quickly.
Oh! That's great, they haven't seen the place since I moved in!
Yeah but when he proposed to me with the ring I got goose bumps.
Honey, we're leaving tomorrow you've still got a lot of packing to do.
Who walks into a room and asks to see a person's hands?!
Yes, but in Ross's case, they both know in two weeks that's it.
Oh good, because uh we got Rachel 800 gallons of water.
Okay, look I need your help, I don't know what to get her for Valentine's Day.
Hey Jo. When'd you start usin' mousse in your hair?
Hey, no way! Come on, this is you guys, call her and work it out.
Uhh, yeah. She uh, she uh, she uh might've mentioned him.
Okay Bob listen uhh, I'm the reason you didn't get the job up here.
Oh no-no-no, no. No, no, no, I just, I just need a pretend ticket.
Look, I'm sorry! But there's nothing I can do, I think I'm in love with her!
Oh my God! If you say that one more time, I'm gonna break up with you!
Y'know, if you listen closely, you can hear a thousand retailers scream.
Well, we're really not that close. Okay, so I guess this is uh, good-bye then.
Pick me, I look great in a tux and I will not steal focus.
Hey Joey, do you wanna play football or you wanna.. Hi, I'm Chandler.
Well, Joey, I wrote a little song today. It's called Get Up.
Oh that makes me feel so warm in my hollow tin chest.
It's-it's about Kathy. Umm, uh, I like her. I like her a lot actually.
Are you kidding? If I wasn't married she'd be rejecting me right now.
Okay, but be careful okay, because I wanna get our security deposit back.
You just, you look so different! Terrific! That dress! That body!
Why don't you go up on stage. I'll get a picture of you doing the speech.
All right. "My husband is sleeping with his secretary." She's married!
Okay, but there is a big difference. You are a lot hotter than I am.
Okay this is great, but Joey said he didn't want any of us out there.
Thanks for trying. Oh, and by the way there is no Count Rushmore!
So we're standing firm on the 'not getting our hopes up'?
Sounds like two people are really enjoying the Dewey decimal system.
Well, this was great. I'll give you a call. We should do it again sometime.
Ah, I fooled around with Joey's sister. Well, that's not the worst part.
You got the lead in a movie? That's amazing! What's the movie about?!
Oh! Right. Umm, maybe that's because I didn't send him an invitation.
Yeah, we were just talking about that. I can't believe how stupid we used to look.
Hey now besides, if worst comes to worst, I'll be your boyfriend.
Braid each other's hair and ride horseback on the beach?
Yeah. Just let me grab my jacket and tell you I had sex today.
Not quite. Monica's still at the salon, and I'm just finishing packing.
Yeah it is really pricey. I mean, I freaked when I first heard the numbers.
Oh since forever! I used to go all over town listening to bands!
Well see now that I can see crying over, but Bambi is a cartoon!
If we keep talking this way, aren't we gonna freak her out soon?
I'm up! I'm up, I've gotten up now! Anybody ah, want anything?
Look, I'm just gonna be across the hall, we can still do all the same stuff.
How did you guys find me? I knew I should've hid at the gym!
You know, once youre inside, you dont have to knock any more.
Really...? See... that's the thing: you gotta keep it smart, people!
I'm sorry man, there's never a good time to stop catching on fire.
How many times have I told you guys, you never watch the cooking channel!
Yeah! I'm just pretending to watch the game so I don't have to help out with stuff.
Ah, well, maybe thats, ah, because youre getting a big raise.
Alright, alright, but you better be wearing clothes when I open my eyes.
It's, all good! Okay bye-bye Mon! She's-she's gonna kill me.
Can't believe you guys bought that, enjoy your slow death .
Dog grooming huh? Okay, just don't make my tail too poofy.
She's not gonna care if I put her stuff back in the same stupid place.
No you are not! You are sweet and wonderful and this is gonna happen for you.
Let me ask you, do you have to be Carol's lesbian life partner?
'kay, look: Can we just drop this? I'm not gonna smoke again.
Look Joe, I just, I just don't want to get your hopes up real high.
Yeah, well, I only have twenty minutes until Ethan, so, y'know..
Oh yeah! He has a caretaker. His older brother... Ernie.
Oh, okay, I have condom in my wallet that I've had since I was twelve.
Wait a minute, hold the phone! You're not talking about Chuckles University?!
What rule? There's no rule, if anything, you owe me a table!
Of course I'm awake. Assume from now on that I'm always awake!
Wow, what a geek. They spent $69.95 on a Wonder Mop.
Hey, does anybody need anything copied? I'm going down to the Xerox place.
Oh, and Ive got Earth Science, but I'll catch you in Gym.
Well, don't we look nice all dressed up?...It's stuff like that, isn't it?
For your information, I was staring at her baby. We're about to be parents.
Well, I just thought it'd make me feel good to do something nice for my friend.
I'm full, and yet I know if I stop eating this, I'll regret it.
Would you get that please? People have been calling to congratulate me all day.
Yes, and while I'm doing that, Ross has a great computer story for you.
Okay, so Rachel's got 48 and Phoebe has the lead in...vegetables, Joey?
Okay. And it's not just chicks y'know? It's all kinds of other animals!
Yeah, I thought so to until I paper mached one of my eyes shut.
All right, if I do this, can we at least discuss sex on the balcony?
Cheese you say? That's some pretty smelly work, huh Don?
Janice was my safety net, ok? And now I have to get a snake.
Oh please, I saw the way you were checking out his mouldings. You want it.
Oh, you know, I would, but that might get in the way of my lying around time.
If that is your father calling to tell this story then the marriage is off!
Well, I... I've got a pop-up book that told me everything I need to know.
The only superpower you have is a slightly heightened sense of smell.
Great, a faster way to tell people that I'm unemployed and childless .
Well, then it looks like somebody is gonna have to give back somebody his cushions.
yeah just some good old fashion girl on girl American action.
Y'know, it's been a while since we've screamed something. Maybe we should.
I don't know! What could she possibly be hiding in here that I can't see?!
They were huge. When she sneezed, bats flew out of them.
I don't, I hate Joseph, ok. I think he's a brown-nosing suck up.
Hey Rach! Ah........ Perfection. Wouldn't change a thing. Not a thing.
Hey! How come I'm stuck dicing, when he gets to ball the melon.
Y'know what Rach, maybe you should just, y'know stay here at the coffee house.
Well why didn't you stop her?! Why didn't you just tell her it was a plan?!
If I untangle you, will you please get rid of the corn rose?
I figured I'd buy those. Pat, I'd like to buy a vow.
Y'know sometimes the good ideas are just right in front of you, aren't they?
Yeah, huh. I'm just uh, you know I'm just picking up some things for a party.
Ohh, she's pretty. Pretty ahh, pretty girl, the pretty--she's pretty.
I do! Want a hint? huh? "I do" "I do".
Oh. Well, hold on camper, are you sure you've thought this thing through?
Oh yes! Monica, get in here! There's a high-speed car chase on!
Stop it! You're killing me! I think I just moved on to Phase Four!
Hey look, are we gonna have to bring this out every time Ross comes over?
The fact that you'd even ask that question shows how little you know me.
It's OK. It's OK. I was always rooting for you two kids to get together.
Thanks, Phoebe. But I just don't really see myself in a big white hat.
No it's not. It's small. It's tiny. It's petite. It's wee.
I cannot believe Ross told you that! And in my defense, it was a Wendy's!
It's a hand. It's a thing you use as a Jack and Coke holder.
Oh my God, I can't believe this! Y'know, I thought...I thought you were a good guy.
I don't know, but Donald Trump wants his blue blazer black.
Uhh, that was Joey. He's running a little late, he says he's sorry.
Yeah, well, I miss the tip! It's the best part. It has the nail.
This is exactly the kind of social situation that I am not comfortable with!
I hear ya. But! Unfortunately, my company is transferring me overseas!
Almost as good as that play with the two naked girls on the see-saw.
The spoon. You licked and-and you put. You licked and you put.
All right!! Wait! Wait, there's no sidewalk! Yeah, I'm gonna die here.
Emma? Emma? Look at me! Well, I think I'll go downstairs for a while.
Oh please, could she be more out of my league? Ross, back me up here.
He's not supposed to ask my girlfriend to marry him! I'm supposed to do that!
Look, you know what? If this is the way you feel, then maybe you should take it.
Ok, now, remember, no trading. You get the pretty one, I get the mess.
But you said you forgave me. It was just a couple of cigarettes-no big deal.
Of course the packaging does appeal to grown-ups and kids alike.
What happened to 'you can't live without me four days a week'?
Apparently my sperm have low motility and you have an inhospitable environment.
No, look, that's it, it's over, I want you out, I want you out of the apartment now.
Your little men are gonna get scored on more times than your sister.
No, I guess I just never really cried. Y'know? I'm not a crying kind of guy.
Yeah, he's lived here for years, I don't, I don't know what you're talking about man.
What are you talking about? We love Schhteve! Schhteve was schhexy!.. Sorry.
Oh, believe me, to survive this party, you're gonna have to come up with one too.
Okay. Listen-listen, we're not gonna have to walk this way the entire time are we?
Well, listen, don't tell us what's gonna happen though, 'cause I like to be surprised.
Oh it's always nicer to here than, "Aw crap! You again!"
Yes, Joey's made arrangements to have his baby in a movie from the 50's.
If you need money, will you please-please just let me loan you some money?
Technically we could have sex again. What do you think, bossy and domineering?!
Okay, I thought of the joke two months ago at lunch with Steve.
Really? Wow. That's some pretty powerful imaginary sperm you must have there.
OK, I'm gonna get some more coffee before the pinching and eye-poking begins.
That's a good thing actually, because ah, he used to have me rehearse with him.
Whoah whoah, back up there, Sparky. What'd you mean by that?
Eh, they're both good. I generally just go with, Monica's drunk again.
Yeah, Joey said I uh, I needed to relax so he gave me an antihistamine.
I'm going crazy! Okay? Do you have any thing around here that looks homemade?
Monica! Can I talk to you for a second? Listen, I appreciate you getting me the costume...
Maybe I could give thanks by taking my Playstation over to my new apartment.
No. But uh, Joey has, and I usually talk to them in the morning time.
Look forget it okay? I don't want to go. I don't want to see him. I don't wanna.
This reminds me of a very specific part of the tape. Okay, here we go.
Yeah, that'd be much worse than being 28, and still working here.
Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew!
Look, I can't do this. I can't make luv to you while we're fighting this way.
Is that your tiny little box, that's too small to put anything in?
All right look, I'm changing it to 50 bucks, or your best offer.
Oh yeah, and what would my opening line be? 'Excuse me. Blarrglarrghh.'
So, how would you like to have a baby that's half yours and half his!
Is it just me, or can you actually see his abs through his overcoat?!
It's your parents' anniversary and you're going to talk about their dead pet?
So you can balloon up or you can shrink down and I will still love you.
I don't get it, I mean, you just got him. How can he be an adult already?
Okay, ten bucks says that we can name every item in that bag.
Ohh, great, I have condom in my wallet I've had since I was twelve.
But I didn't get to shake my belly like a bowl full of jelly.
No, I mean it, this feels really good. Is it a hundred percent cotton?
Oh hey, it's, it's terriffic. I mean it's a regular space... fest.
Our eyes are closed and we're about to cross the street. Very good.
Okay, a little problem. The key broke in the lock and I can't get in!
Another cheesecake came! They delivered it to the wrong address again!
Uh, what about y'know the massage thing? That never gave you a heart attack.
Half a tank? We still got a lot of high-speed chasing to do!
So I was right. This is what it feels like to be right. It's oddly unsettling.
Wow, it seems serious. What seems to be the problem, Ashley Judd?
I just walked in the bathroom and saw Kathy naked! It was like torture!
Oh no-no-no! Stay! Stay! Because you-you should you-you-you should stay!
Yeah, it's almost if Air Barbados doesn't care about your social life.
I-I can't believe Jill's gone. I can't help it, I opened a gate.
The most unbelievable thing has happened. Underdog has just gotten away.
Does that room have a closet I can lock him in? We'll take it.
Well, maybe since the age of 9, Frannie's made some new friends.
Oh good. Good, because I'm sure this interview is gonna last a couple of weeks.
Weekly Estimated Net Usage Systems. A processing term.
No, I realize that honey, but I'm not gonna spend all of the money on one party.
She's not gonna make you wear one of those big plastic cones, is she?
Well, the gay community is a lot more vocal than the dead community.
Oh yeah. First off all, chasing the Churo guy isn't jogging.
I don't know. Maybe he hooked up with that hot girl he was talking to.
So Dan, nurse not a doctor huh? Kinda girlie isn't it?
I just came over to drop off...nothing. So that weekend kinda sucked, huh?
Oooh, did he put a little starch in your bloomers? Who said that?
Oh, Ross, when you make out card; be sure to make it out to, EM-I-LY.
Okay, all right, I'll just uh, make sure that uh, Joey gets her something really great.
OK well here, we'll just move the coffee table closer to the couch.
You know, this is actually good, because if we ever lose Ross, we have a spare.
It's fine, it's fine. Look, do you wanna get this part, or not? Here.
Well, let's just say the impressions you made in the butter left little to the imagination.
