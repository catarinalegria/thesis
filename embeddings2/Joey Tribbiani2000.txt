Oh, I'm sorry. I meant no.
That's not funny at all!
"I need an answer!"
People, people, people.
Seriously, who is this guy?
Yeah, in a poem maybe.

Wow, that was kinda brutal.
Good luck, good luck!
Hey, Ross, want some cider?
Stop staring at me!
Look who's coming around!
You're right, I'm sorry. You're right.
No no no, behind it.
What?!! That's even worse!!
Congratulations! You just got married!
You know, I think I was sixteen.
Can I change a hundred?
Ooh...I hear that's bad.
What? Chandler! Tell 'em!
That's the best birthday ever.
Is that the fire alarm?
Oh my God. You and Rachel?
I'm, I'm okay. See.
Phoebs, what's goin' on?
What's the matter with Rog?
So, are you ready to go?
A four and a nine.

Oh no-no-no-no, I meant Chandler.
Ha, oh, of course.
Oh my God! You're pregnant!
Yes! Shame about you man.
No, couldn't care less.
But Rachel has an apartment.
Ahh, you drive safe.
Right, I go-, I got it.
Won't-won't that take longer?
Yeah, she's gonna live with me!
All right, how about the ladybugs?
So but everything is normal.

She was kidding about that right?
Ah. Slow swimmers?
Who the hell is this guy?
Yeah. I'll see you in the morning.
No, can we get back to me?
I will not take this abuse.
You are beautiful, you know that?
And for Ross, Mr. Sweet-tooth.
So we are going on two?
If you don't do it, I will.
Can I offer you a drink?
They were in his office.
Your eyebrows look weird.
Dude you said, "No!"
Hey I got one! I got one!

All right, what are we havin'?
Oh well, okay, good luck.
Come on here, have a seat.
Hey, here's a thought, Ross.
Y'know, we don't have to imagine.
Could you get me a muffin?
Err... Kind of.
Plastic spoons. Great.
Sorry. Wrong boobies.
Uh...well...just once...with you...
I'm falling in love with you.
I'll treat you real nice.
See, this is a great apartment.
Y'know-y'know what I really want?
Ye-ye, we go to yours!
I guess I didn't really think about it.
Yeah, where the hell is he?
Ooh, Ross, look! Look!
Monica, how are you gonna do that?
Why is 10 the highest?
Oh, yeah, yeah, listen for it.
No idea what it means.
Then you hold on to it!!
Somebody help me out here!
I left them at the park.
What-But you saw the show!
... she's being unreasonable!
So uh, what are you guys doing?
I can't! It-it's stuck!
Ross, Ross, Ross... It's okay.
Damnit! anybody got anything?
Ahhhhhh, I didn't get the job.
So, there was no miracle?!
Uh, ah, Monica's pregnant?!
Is it back in the cage?
Beth, Beth dies?
Yeah, yeah, I met this woman.
Maybe he found you flip-flop.
I don't know, it looks the same.
It's really starting to hurt.
But, he loves Emily?
That is so not my motto.
Hey! It's your bachelor party.
Matter of fact, I do.
I don't know! But it's the same!
Still not hot enough!
Hey, Ross, you're okay with that?
I'm just mad at my agent.
What are you guys doing in here?
How do you know about that story?!
Sure! Where are the seats?
Yeah that didn't sound like me.
Yeah, yeah sure, goodnight.
I'm telling you man, I saw it.
Now she sounded breezy.
Great, you can cover Chandler.
Whoa! And the... huh-huh?
Yeah! Yeah, why? What's up?
I don't know. What are you wearing?
Yeah, I don't think that's what it is.
Oh well then, good night!
And now for the great news.
What-what is it, what is it?
Oh yeah, sure. No problem.
Mornin'. I said, mornin'.
Who you what? Who you what?!
Oh uh-uh yeah, I think that.
I did do it, I'm a professional.
Y'know I blame Ross for this.
I, um, can't tell you.
You want me to lie to Chandler?
Hey, there's a dog out there!
Yeah uh, what am I gonna do?
Yeah, well, it feels different.
What?! Oh my-oh my God!
Chandler, wait, wait, wait...
It's like me when I was born.
Okay. See?! I told ya!
You're gonna have to pee on it.
Exellent dream score.
Mma, Mma, Mmaah
Oh-oh! TIME LAPSE.
Spock's birth control.

Thank you. Yeah, I appreciate that.
Hey, it's your girlfriend, Rachel!
All right! I'll have a sandwich!
Oh sorry. Uh-uh, Kash?
Yeah, or-or to get a hooker.
All right Phoebs, way to go.
Oh, I had the opposite dream.
Well what am I supposed to do?
I can't believe I'm hearing this!
