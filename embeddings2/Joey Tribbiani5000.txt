"I need an answer!"
People, people, people.
Seriously, who is this guy?

You are beautiful, you know that?
And for Ross, Mr. Sweet-tooth.
So we are going on two?
If you don't do it, I will.

They were in his office.
Your eyebrows look weird.

Y'know, we don't have to imagine.
Could you get me a muffin?
Err... Kind of.
Plastic spoons. Great.
Sorry. Wrong boobies.
Uh...well...just once...with you...
I'm falling in love with you.
I'll treat you real nice.
See, this is a great apartment.
Y'know-y'know what I really want?
Ye-ye, we go to yours!
I guess I didn't really think about it.
Yeah, where the hell is he?
Ooh, Ross, look! Look!
Monica, how are you gonna do that?
Why is 10 the highest?
Oh, yeah, yeah, listen for it.
No idea what it means.
Then you hold on to it!!
Somebody help me out here!
I left them at the park.
What-But you saw the show!

So uh, what are you guys doing?
I can't! It-it's stuck!
Ross, Ross, Ross... It's okay.
Damnit! anybody got anything?
Ahhhhhh, I didn't get the job.
So, there was no miracle?!
Uh, ah, Monica's pregnant?!
Is it back in the cage?
Beth, Beth dies?
Yeah, yeah, I met this woman.
Maybe he found you flip-flop.
I don't know, it looks the same.
It's really starting to hurt.
But, he loves Emily?
That is so not my motto.
Hey! It's your bachelor party.
Matter of fact, I do.
I don't know! But it's the same!
Still not hot enough!
Hey, Ross, you're okay with that?
I'm just mad at my agent.
What are you guys doing in here?
How do you know about that story?!
Sure! Where are the seats?
Yeah that didn't sound like me.
Yeah, yeah sure, goodnight.
I'm telling you man, I saw it.
Now she sounded breezy.
Great, you can cover Chandler.
Whoa! And the... huh-huh?
Yeah! Yeah, why? What's up?
I don't know. What are you wearing?
Yeah, I don't think that's what it is.
Oh well then, good night!
And now for the great news.
What-what is it, what is it?
Oh yeah, sure. No problem.
Mornin'. I said, mornin'.
Who you what? Who you what?!
Oh uh-uh yeah, I think that.
I did do it, I'm a professional.
Y'know I blame Ross for this.
I, um, can't tell you.
You want me to lie to Chandler?
Hey, there's a dog out there!
Yeah uh, what am I gonna do?
Yeah, well, it feels different.
What?! Oh my-oh my God!
Chandler, wait, wait, wait...
It's like me when I was born.
Okay. See?! I told ya!
You're gonna have to pee on it.
Exellent dream score.

Oh sorry. Uh-uh, Kash?
Yeah, or-or to get a hooker.

Well, when it's not right, you know it.
Well, that's really a different question.
I don't know how to play Cups.
Don't make me come up there!
Oh yeah, I added three.
I don't know, but it sounds great.
Phoebe, what-what are you doing?!
Je depli mblue.

All right where's that turkey!
Hang up, hang up.

I need to talk to you about Charlie.

I don't know! Maybe she's crazy!
What? Me having a job?
No, I sat in the paint.
You wanna see her again, right?
Uhh, just a minute officer!!
So, so how did it happen?
I couldn't even if I wanted too.
How do you do there, Wayne?
Yeah, what's up with that Serpico?
Yeah, that's one naked hooker!
See, now it's weird again.
Look, it was a job all right?

Kate, do you even like me?
Yeah? What did ya have?
Oh my God! What did you say?
I'm sorry, it just felt nice.
I wanna be mr. Wigglemunch.
Kate Miller it is.
Me! I'm up for puppets!
Why, are you moving out?
Then why would you say that?!
That-that is a good trick.
Funny one! That's good!
Did you get your money back?
Yeah, you hang in there Teddy!
Everything doesn't sound fine!
Well, they go into the chipper.
I have actually not heard of that.
When have I ever done that?!
Arghhh! Double standards!
Food? Uh-huh gimme!

Oh wow, I don't feel well.
Hey! Is the show still on?

It's okay, these things happen.
Get out of here, really?!
I'm doing my scenes with you?

Hey, are you unsupporting me again?
So...I've never played that!
Yes! And the table is mine.
That guy's still doing that?!
Oh, oh, I got it! Pete-Chicago.
Chandler, it's like a big gerbil.
This will just be my batch.
Yeah, the Knicks rule all!
There it is, you're blushing!
Oh, good to know. So close!
I didn't know it was an auction!
Oh, women can. You can't.
NOW look what you did!!
Of course it was a line!
So, we're having fun, right?
No-no-no, no it's uh, it's okay.
Maybe we should just eat now.
So you're really doing this, huh?
Oh, all right, I can ask Monica.
Okay, get ready to owe me!
Hey, listen, lady.... ...whoa.
You are? Ross, I'm sorry..
"I could go right now."
Yeah, it seemed pretty important.
Wow, that's, uh, dirty.
Uh, some of her friends, yeah.
Yeah! You...you were wonderful.
Oh sure, go with the sissy.
Yeah, they're great seats too!
You were right. He is funny.
I'm not going anywhere, sweetheart.
Yeah, I thought I was pretty good too.
Well he made Rachel cry!
Ma! What're you doing here?
Was his name Angus?
It certainly is a miracle.
Oh, just, y'know.... science.
I'm missin' picture time?!
Wow! You blow my mind...
Because they wanted me to audition!
This thing welded shut?!
What? That's not? Oh my God.
You want to see her again, right?

Way to be strong, man!
Hey! You don't get a say in this!
Okay, how did this even happen?
Ah, yes, The Plan!
Y'know, about what happened with us.
A place to eat spaghetti.
'Sup? 'Sup dude?
Glow-pop giggly jammer.
Oh-hoh! Ha-hah! See!
One-Mississippi. Two-Mississippi. Three-Mississippi.

You fall for it every time!
Oh, I'm sorry. You wanna bite?
Can you tell me how this happened?
Dude, two times that happened!
Would fall off a lot.
Ahh, the babies miss me?
But I'm bursting with u-hu!
Judge rules, no violation.
Pheebs, give me the ring back!
Where do you think, Zelda?
Yeah good luck, good luck.
Hold on, you-you knew?
Aw, I know all about Kip!

I'm sorry! It was a reflex!
Hey, hey, look at that talent.
Oh, I chose not to hear that.
Can I talk to you for a second?!
You ah, you forgot your shoes.
I put it on to scare Chandler!
Oh yeah, yeah, sure. Absolutely.
Have you been here all night?
Fake? Excuse me? Hello?
Hey, Bonnie had sex there!
You don't have to worry about that okay?
Why don't we just go on two.
How's that different? Oh! Yeah!
Why don't you like PBS, Pheebs?
Yeah, but it did happen, so...
You think I need a new walk?
All right, we'll start with...apples.
Wow, Pheebs! That sounds great!
The Mr. Bowmont's here!!!
Now, don't argue with me...
Well, I know what's the matter with me.

Hey buddy! How's it going?
Gotcha. Phoebs, walk with me.
So? Did have sex, right?
Wow! Uh okay, well uh...

Not if you're gonna be like this!
I can't believe what I'm hearing here.
Fan out! Fan out!
No, that means nothin to me.
Yeah Bing, what's that about?
Not from where I was standin.
That means a lot to me man.
All right, I'll take care of it.
What are you guys woofing about?
No, I'm alright man. Really.
No, sorry haven't seen him.
I'm so worried about him, y'know?
So I guess it's Joey then!
I lie better then that, right?
Hi I'm Joey. This is Chandler.
Hey, how was your chef thing?
Who do you think its from?
Yeah, well, you don't have your racket.
Well, I think we all learned something.
She was nothing compared to you.
Oh, she's uh-uh really sick.
Come on in, how are ya?
Yeah, that guy really hurt us.
All right! So, was it amazing?
Ooooh! Freeze him out.
That's not fair! I can't do that.
Joey Tribbiani, a big fan.
Oh! Hey Rach, listen umm...
Maybe you two should live together.
Dude I just did something terrible.
Look, you wanna use our place?
"When can you move in?"
Very good! Okay. G.
Oh uh, can I give you a hand?
So he likes to break stuff.
Sure, what do you want to see?
Hey, I think Emma might like it!
Dude, step up! I proposed.
If I can't have it you can't have it!
Frankie? What're you talking about?
Maybe she never got your message.
Ah, Rach, it doesn't say that!
What? No-no it's her birthday!
Hey, I didn't stalk her. I mean
I'm afraid I'm gonna need proof.
No-no-no, that-that's me, that's me.
All right! You can have the chair.
So did that do anything for ya?
You do attract some stinkers.
Good luck. And I'm still right!
Lookin' good Mr. Cotter.
Oh, it's Ross's bachelor party.
Oh! My head! Oh! Oh!
Oh-ho-kay, I'm talking to the king.
You wanna eat? My treat!
Oh, hey, don't forget your shirt.
Paper, snow, a ghost!
Hey, you're Mike's parents, right?
All right, I'll see you in the morning.
Your other student, was you!
Do, do you gonna do it now?
Hey, uhh, I need to talk to you.
How'd you get over that teacher?
Hey, do we do this too much?
Right! And when is that due?
Come on look guys, don't fight.
I bet it was about her a little.
Yeah it is. . . what?
Okay, here we go. I can't do it.
I don't get it, Chandler loved it!
My Giant? I love that movie!
Oh, yoii. What was that for?
And the duck gets the Nutter-Butter!
I won! That was my guess!
Which one, they all suck!
Nice. Oh hey, what about Ross?
Man, do you know what guys want!
So, you'd hire me, right?
Come on you guys, one more time.
Here, I brought you some flowers.
You know what the. . .
Sure, neighbor come on in.
They're ribbed for your pleasure.
Hey Chandler, do we know that lady?
Oh, it went amazingly well!
Hey, is, is, is Chandler here?
What?! I didn't touch a guitar!
Kiss her! Kiss her!
I gotta go check something over here.
Pheebs, he seems to enjoy it.
Okay, so will you meet with her?
Hey, it's me! I'm comin' in!
Chandler, will you just come in already?
Can I tell you something? Me too.
I'll be right back. What was that?
Girls Chandler could never get?
Oh man! I thought I got it all!
Okay, you watch too much TV.
Why, just a tiny little...
No! Never! Never! Bye.
Check this out. Can I have this?
Dude! I am trying to sleep!
Then you do. Heh, heh.
No! I'm putting that in my room.
What are you talking about? Bitch.
Hm-mm! Yeah nice necklace!
Yeah! A little bit, yeah...
Absolutely! He's not thinking about you.
No it isn't, I ate that.
I would say, "Woman, please!"
You gotta tell Ross how you feel.
Alright... I've got to go shower.
Hey, how do you spell suspicious?
But, but wh-what about us?
Oh, I'm-I'm not working tomorrow.
I know why I don't remember her, huh?
Excellent! Okay umm, doggy.
Don't worry, I had it dry-cleaned.
How long do you have to go for?
Ross, how could you let this happen?
Yeah. Ross and Rachels Apartment.
Fifth day's a charm.
Come on, I need your help here.
That's because all people are selfish.
Actually we prepared performances.
I can't believe you're not picking me.
Two brothers, one died!
Monica, relax, go get a beer.
Okay! Here we go. Pillow.
Pheebs, who's Evelyn Dermer?
... It's a fertility study.
Me neither, y'know what-
Friends first? That's interesting.
Uh, you gotta press the button.
When do you think we lost her?
Sure. So how long you been...
Well-well-see? Parents are comin'!
I'm tellin' you Ross, she wants you.
What are you ah, what are you gonna do?
Yeah. All right, I'll talk to you later.
Hi. Hi, sorry I'm late.
Oh, I'm sorry. Did I get 'ya?
All right so, so what do I do?
Oh what then? Kick me?
We're 29, we're not women.
Well, so, stay for the museums!
Beth is really, really sick.
Ok, look, maybe I should just go.
Oh yeah? And who do you like?
Oh, Bob, get off the guy!
You'd better act surprised.
I figure my character has kids.
Hey, it hasn't come to that yet.
Oh, ah- the kid has it.
That uh, that is my roommate Rachel.
Wait. Give him a minute.
Man, this is gonna be kinda weird.
So how you two gettin' along?
And you feel like we hold you back.
I can't find the remote. Thank you.
It's not what you think, that was...
Hard to tell, I was naked.
Or! You can just, y'know...
Come on man, really how old?!
What's that now? Opening credits.
Oh right great! Welcome aboard!
So you're ruling out surrogacy?
Oh, now it's a spare room?
No. Rosita does not move.
And you're not supposed to be gossiping!!
Oh yeah! The casserole lady.
My chair heels itself.
Uhhh, I don't think you're gonna like this.
What? Mine aren't tinted.
Just okay-Did you do it right?!
Did I say you could smell it?!
Sure, I know lots of girls.
Oh, don't worry, it's not a cat.
By someone besides Monica?
Ross, you're mayor of the zone.
Uh, it's 2:30 in the morning!
But it's an original Buffay...
Yeah, she is. Wow! How you doin'?
Yeah. Listen to the slutty nurse.
What?! What's wrong with my eyes.
What happens if you flick it?
Ooh, I'll play! I'll play!
Phoebe here with the cab yet?
Will you quit hoggin' it!
Really? You'd-you'd do that for me?!
Hey, you're ah, pretty good at this.
Probably wanna know what I'm doing...?
Yeah! I'll see ya later! Yeah!
Why don't you tell me something I don't know!
No! He blew us off!
Okay, time to take off the bra.
What's the game?! What's the game?!
Great! All right. I'll see you later.
What the hell are you talking about??
A meatball Sub? Thanks!
Thanks. That means a lot to me.
Now, wh-what, what is that like?
I don't see the baby. Where is it?
Err, "I think you know".
Mike, 'attorney at law'!
Damn! I am good at Cups!
Here we go! Here we go!
Saw a girl with that vest.
That's not what she said last night.
Because! You're mean on the boat!
Our place, the hall! I...
Yeah, he had a paper route.
Can you believe they're still not here?
Dude, I'm telling ya! I'm fine!
Look, Rachel, we don't have to do this.
Yeah! How you doin'? Yeah alright!
Wow Pheebs, you speak Italian?
So, I hear you're single now...
Dude! How come you took off?
All right, we have to pick captains.
I look more like him than you do!
Okay. Phoebe Thank you. Thank you!
Hey Ross! The baby's kicking!
Hey, that coupon expires, you know.
Needs some clothes altered?
So, why are you still wearing it?
What's he doin' in my section?
Uh... Charlie and I broke up.
Will you let the lady talk?!
Somebody wanna help me out here?
Because you two were having sex!
Oh no, no-no-no-no! I don't want to know!
What the hell am I supposed to do!
He cut off his ear.
He's back! The peeper's back!
Come on man, you're not a potato.
Look! Oh! Is that the Pope?!
A woman in a man's body.
Oh, I don't know.... Yeah, can't do it.
This is it! This is my category.
Oh my, would you look at that!
Because it kinda looked like I did.
Pheebs, I still need some help here.
You don't think my mom's sexy?
I don't know why you just don't say left.
Where is the waitress?! I'm starving!
It doesn't look good, does it?
See ya. Well, this is just us.
You don't wanna see what I just saw!
Yeah. Why are you getting so upset?
Yeah. What-what did Tag say?
Hey-ooh Pheebs, are they in there?
Hey! Did Chandler show up yet?
Has it always been purple?
Hey, you're the one that loves the picture.
Oh, you're not taking her with you tonight?
Hey uh, where do you guys want this?
Well, I-I might've said supergay.
Oh, forget about it. She rocks!
Who's your friend? He's hot!
Do you want me to want you to care?
I can't believe you're not going to propose!
I can see why, nice shirt!
Chandler giving you a hard time huh?
no. No, I, I couldn't do that.
Chandler, come on nothing even happened!
We were gonna go see the Jets!
Hey-hey, who's your friend? Hey!!
Really? She... she loves me?
I will sit with you Dr. Geller.
Oh, so you're playing Adrienne, huh?
Vomiting stories are funny...
Ooh, names? Opening credits.
Yeah. With a bite! Gee-e-e-eez!
That's a uh, that's a tough combination.
I think I left a donut up here.
Hey, what have you guys been up too?
All right, I guess this will be fine.
Says who? Your mom?
Oh yeah, that was a pretty good night.
Come on! You like this woman, right?
Ross, don't let her drink anymore!
And you couldn't think of anything else?!
I want to go on a ride along!
Fine! Do you want something to drink?
Look, I don't wanna hear this right now.
Is he still mad at us?
You talked to him. Are you crazy?
Dude, you soooo need this car.
Oh-whoa-hey, dude, what are you doing?!
Oh, "you do, do you"?
The Irish gig guy?!
I-I can't handle this, you guys.
Hey Rach, you uh, you want some sandwich?
Who's that dirty old lady?
So did you guys make it in time?
All right, you're right. I'll talk to her.
Ross! Can I talk to you for a second?
I know I should've. "I'm sorry."
Let's go watch it at your place.
He's planning your birthday party.
You're driving me crazy with that!
I'm gonna be on two TV shows!
I wanted to go to the strip club!
Say that to him and you're golden.
"I need an answer now!"
Hey man, you feeling any better?
What award are you practicing for?
Yeah, maybe he just cheated on you.
Uhm... Aren't you a little overdressed?
Yeah, we haven't dropped it in...
I was kinda hoping you'd stay.
Thanks! Yeah, there's pulp in that.
I totally don't know what you're talking about.
Y'know what else makes you wonder?
Oh that's terrible. I'm-I'm really sorry.
Seriously, Ross, you don't want in on this?
We were supposed to bring presents?
Boy, that guy's underwear sucks!
See? Eh, wasn't that fun?
I was just gonna call you! That's weird.
Maybe you could take Charlie shopping.
No, I had sex in high school.
Well, I ain't gonna say no to that.
That's a great story-can I eat it?
I know. Yeah, his name is Pat.
Yeah, but sandwich time is right now.
But you two were supposed to be together.
That's right! And what are you not gonna do?
Wait, wait. Do you hear that?
Oh well, it's not on TV yet.
It looks like a women's purse.
OW, why, why, why?
Yeah! You three have a nice Thanksgiving.
All right! Hey, who wants pizza?!
Okay. Can I squeeze your ass?
Whoa-whoa, Treeger made you cry?
Uh, don't you mean "for whom?"
Then why do you throw like one?
Hey, what's the horsepower on this thing?
Well uh...I think I want to take Chandler.
Oh, yeah! How was I supposed to know?
I'm gonna be an uncle! Come here!
It'll be great for next weekend.
All right, relax. It's just a shoe.
Just when I thought we could be friends.
Hap.. Hap.. Happy Thanksgiving.
Oh, that looks great! Good ordering!
No, I wasn't gonna ask you that, no.
Yeah-well-yeah! Yeah-oh-yeah. Come on in.
But you said he was this great guy!
You're fake laughing too, right?
Whoa-whoa you guys, it's not a cat!
Ohh... I wonder if that dude.
Yes! Excellent! Perfect score!
Ohh, get these things out of me!
Oh my God, you guys have no idea.
I am learning so much from you.
What are you talking about? Keep it!
Well, it doesn't matter what I would do.
Come on, quite yankin' me.
No, they-they weren't in the play.
Yeah you got 5 years left!
Oh, not at all. Happy to do it.
Alright, look, I'll start, OK?
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Let her dangle.
Heh, heh. It was nothin'.
Try it, I can't feel a thing!
Okay. Yeah. Yeah, I'll grab this one.
Oh no-no-no, give me some specifics.
Mine's is to Lilian Myers.
Bob? Who the hell's Bob?
Dude, you see right thru me!!
Hey, hey. How was the first day?
What you-you don't think I'm gonna win?
Hey! Joey Tribbiani! I'm here! I'm here!
You guys are messin' with me, right?
Hey Mon! Want some pancakes?
Does it have to be a whole day?
That's the fastest I have ever thought!
Oh, hey, Monica, we've got a question.
Sweepin'. Why? Turn you on?
Couldn't I just sleep with the producer?
Something called Braxton-Hicks contractions.
Wow! How do you know how to do that?!
Maybe she meant to get you a hooker.
I say push her down the stairs.
You a little sad about that sweetheart?
It's not that far! Just drop!
Hey Phoeb's, I think you're good to go.
Wow! Can I get a copy of that?
Well, why do you call him Gandolf?
Monica, hey, can I borrow the Porsche?
Hey, Monica, who would yours be?
Hey, if you need a tour guide...
Hey, whaddya wanna do for dinner?
Can we please turn this off?
Oh that's mine too! I'm Italian!
Hello Mr. Bing...I love you.
Oh we kissed it up real nice.
Me too, we should get goin'.
No, inside good, outside bad.
Did that guy really make that joke?
Is that college talk for horny?
Well, may I ask for one example?
Oh, they cut me out of the show.
That doesn't sound like thinking to me!
I can't believe it, Ross. This sucks!
Uh, no, she's at dance class.
Let's just say I took care of it.
Oh, I don't know Pheebs. It'll be okay.
Ok. He kept my dollar.
Yeah, I know, I sleep in the next room.
Wooooooooow It's like they're on fire!
Yeah that'd be great! Thanks Pheebs!
Anyone mind if I save this?
I fell down an elevator shaft.
Well, I eat a lot of meat right?
Real estate, huh? Hmmm...
How come the writing is in Spanish?
Hey guys! What 'cha been doin'?
Yeah!! I call that London style.
Ewwwww!! Ew! Ew! Ew!
Really?! Uhh, what color is it?
Yeah but, I can pronounce Jurassic.
Let's see what else he'll do!
Oh wow! You can tell this soon.
Many are scheduled to appear.
"...Amy! Happy birthday to you!"
You just give him a spoon baby!
If he goes first he can!
If anything should happen to him...
Nah, it's okay. Right, Gunther?
Fine ... mediocre porn.
My whole family's from Naples!
Yeah Connecticut...Not West Virginia.
Ohhhh! These seats are great!
With this ring? No contest.
I don't know. You uh, you got something for me?
Man, I've got food all over me.
I thought you didn't have secrets from Monica.
Yeah, she tops out at 130.
Yeah, and not put us in the middle.
This is clearly in the wrong apartment.
Yeah? Really? No one's home?
I really made you think about that thing uh?
You got to go on a ride along?!
So, so, what'd ya think?
Alright, when'd'ya have it on last?
Look, do you want the ring or not?!
It's a pleasure to meet you Ray.
Yeah, you shoulda been there last night.
This is like the temporary robot, right?
But over the past few weeks...
Uh, hang out?! How long?
Oh. No! No wait, that's weird!
Why do I smell men's cologne?
So you uh, nervous about getting married?
And of course, crotchless panties.
I can't believe you didn't know it was a line!
Oh no! No!! My hole!!
So why don't you give me your number?
Yeah, of course. I can control myself.
Okay, for next time, what do you say?
It's like the cheapest college ever.
Hey, uh, why don't you read it to her?
What are we supposed to be seeing here?
Maybe you'll order a little sangria?
No! Year! Happy No Year!
Well maybe we just take that one away.
Now let's not get carried away.
I'm glad we had this little talk.
Oh no, I'll be done by then.
No it's not weird, it's a miracle!
Well look, hey, it's all your fault!
How you doin'? Joey Tribbiani, America.
Well, the part's mine if I want it.
They did it right there on the couch.
Hey! Is uh, is she gonna be all right?
You liked it? You really liked it?
And you never knew she was a lesbian...
I don't know. Why? Did you hear something?
Oh... uh... look... before you...
Yeah, we're goin' to a Ranger game.
Here, I got five, I got five.
I'm the lead in Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.!!
What are you in love with her or something?
Damnit, I'm a doctor, I'm not God.
Hey, y'know you could always visit him.
Oh, unbelievable! We had the best time!
I know! My grandmother's gonna see this!
Yeah, they're stuck inside the table!
They gave me the shaft all right.
I'm movin' out like we talked about.
I like to see the previews. The candy.
Oh! I forgot you used to live here!
Dude, dude! I think you're losing it.
You, you want me to help you with that?
Nicole Eggert. You'll like her.
He doesn't do much, does he?
Forget about it. It's no big deal.
.....Well, this is still ruined, right?
Obviously! So, how do we decide?
I don't know, but I don't like what I'm hearing!
I'm thinking we've got a bookcase here.
Come on, I mean, you know me, you know...
Hey! I am secure with my masculinity.
Come on you stupid machine! Come on!
Please, we're trying to have a conversation.
Well, I know what I'm giving you for Christmas.
But you're spittin' all over me man!
Hey!!! Oww!! And I'm bleeding.
But sadly I could not be enticed.
Hey uh, is it okay to come in?
I know! That's why they trashed me!
Yeah, life's pretty great isn't it?
No-no-no-no-no, I'm not fallin' for that again.
Hey, I see you guys already met, huh?
Hit me! Ohh man! Wait!
I guess so. I'm just... really nervous.
Well that's like summer in a bowl.
You went through my personal property?
Nope, got it and I got yours too.
Dude, I am sorry about what I said!
No! No! No, not after seeing that.
Thanks. Congratulations on your big break.
Oh my God!!! I can't believe that!!
Oh that's great! Oh thank you so much!
Uhh, hey. Where's the other guy?
Don't worry about that man, that happens.
Well, how long do you think it'll be?
So when do we get to meet the guy?
What?! What good is that gonna do anybody?
We could climb Mt. Everest!
No-no, not for like another two weeks.
Dude, tell me she actually told you this.
Cookie, now you can punch him!
Hey! Dude, some guy just called for you.
I'm a doctor Cliff, not a mathematician.
Yeah, he's done some amazing works.
Ooh, look-look-look-look-look! I got Monica naked!
We're gonna climb Mt. Everest!
Why would he turn off the TV?
Maybe he's. . . gay.
Oh uh, me and Ross can be the judges.
Thanks. Well but this one starts now.
Great! All right, so I'll call you later.
No, I-I miss hanging out with you.
Wait a second, I could star in it!
Ooh, we could end up with nothing.
Hey Pheebs, guess who we saw today.
Well, just shimmy down me and drop!
They break your heart, don't they?
Me too. Alright, whattaya got.
OK Thanks.. I touched the stuff.
Why are you taking this away from me?
Check out the rack on this chick!
He paid a lot of money for it.
Yeah, I didn't throw any of that out..
But you haven't even heard the chorus!
But it's available now! Isn't it?
You don't have to seem so happy about it.
Man, I didn't think we were gonna make it!
Yeah, can you see me in a place like this?
Yes! I will have the lobster ravioli.
Did you see the size of the closets?!
That noise can only me one thing.
That's some gentle comedy, dude.
Oh, and plus I'm 1/16th Portuguese.
Yeah... we really need to talk to Ross...
Yes! Yes, you're back in the lead!
Okay that's the green stuff talkin'.
You stepped on my egg roll?
Hey, you know our phone's not working?
I can do that, yeah. How is Friday?
Yeah, I know what you mean. I mean, sometimes...
All that stuff you just said? I want that!
Uhhhh.... I'll just pee in the street.
You won't boss me around anymore?
I don't know. Ooh, I bet it's Richard.
I can't believe she would say that too you.
I just got off the phone with my sister.
Je de coup Clow.
aaand SEND! Opening credits.
Maybe he could slip her the tongue.
Okay, I guess it doesn't seem that weird.
Oh, uh, okay, how, how about now?
Im sayin I see a difference.
Dude, come on! French it u-up!
So you uh, have a...big work problem?
What, what are you doing? What are you doing?
Ooh-ooh-ooh! Are we opening presents?
Why-why would she go in the bedroom?
The Unbearable Likeness of Being!
Yeah, that's the uh, game we were playing.
That's OK, Ross, you can ask me. What?
Oh, her ankles are a little chubby.
So you're gonna have to do it in the mess!
Well, it turns out you were right C.H.E.E.S.E.
Well yeah, don't-don't you think it's a she?
You're blowin' me off for a monkey?
Shhh! Man, you made me lose it!
Oh no-no-no-no, she wants to talk to you!
Okay listen, how are you gonna ask her?
But it hurt's my Joey's Apple.
Aaahh... How much do I owe you?
I'm not really comfortable with these questions!
You got to tell me exactly what to do there.
And-and-and-and-and-and, and we're gonna be friends again!
Hey listen guys, we feel really terrible.
Yeah, that's sad. Mashuga nut?
Yeah. Uh, ...a slice......six dollars?
Wow, what-what do you think she wants?
Umm, well, what else could it be?
So, so is she still going to Paris?
Hey you guys, this is my agent, Estelle.
They're ribbed for *your* pleasure.
Uh, eleven, eleven and a half.
Oh, you're fine, yeah, for a first job.

Chandler, come on, you're gonna find somebody.
Hey. Can, uh, can we help you?
What are these, like famous chickens?
It's pretty, Okay date of birth?
That's like a woman wanting to be a...
Anything I can do? Whatever you need.
Hey all right, Ross came as doody.
Hey, how did you do that?! Come on in.
Uh, she's with me. Dr. Drake Remoray.
Ooh, sorry. Sorry. You finish, go.
Cause she uh, she steals stuff.
So, did you err... did you tell Ross?
Hey, being you is finally gonna pay off!
So, does that mean the audition is off?
You're right, you're right, I'll get back to work.
You know you've been spitting on me?!
Here. Now I only owe you $49.50.
Me too! Me too! Me too!
Hey Monica, what's on this video tape?
The guy still won't put out, huh?
Not much to tell there I'm really shy.
You know, the baby can't read, Mike!
Oh! Hey! Thank God you guys are here!
Hey. Mr. Douglas is looking for you.
Oh my God, is she going back to him?
Je te flouppe Fli.
I know I don't have too! It tastes good.
That's not what I said. Okay, I just meant...
And starting to think about settling down!
No, no... how come you are working here?
I don't believe we've met, Joey Tribbiani.
I've never slept with someone for a part.
I can't. I keep seeing it the good way.
All right, huddle up, right over here.
Monica, you understand what we are saying, right?
I agree. I'm, like, in disbelief.
Actually uh, could you give us a second?
Man, I wish I had a nanny like you.
That's mean! You really had me going there!
I'll tell you about it later. Be cool.
Yeah. Why-Yeah, that would work for ya...
I just want you to say it once in a while.
Sure, no problem. Ooh-Hey, donuts!
What's my little chef got for me tonight?
All right Pheebs, stick out your plate!
Hey Ross, I'm aware of what I owe.
So I got your car, it's right outside.
Okay, five hundred dollars. What else?
Not knowing when to shut up...
Hey, no way, that rooster's family!
Well, I... I know exactly what I'm gonna do!
Dude, I really don't think you should be wearing that.
Was the chord at least right...
Fine, make fun. I think it's jaunty.
Awww! Mel Torme died.
Hey Gunther, have you uh, have you seen Chandler?
Oh great, that'd be great. Thank you.
All right now, so? What do you think?
Oh, uh... don't forget your coupon. .
All right. But, you're gonna have to tell them.
Well, there's really only one thing you can do.
Huh. So then I can heat this up?
You're right! That did cheer me up!
Just a, uh... hearing disability.
That's great! Hey, can you cast me in it?
We can't watch that! I mean that's Phoebe!
Well, who knew? Pharmacists are fun.
I.. I.. I need a good lie.
U-U-Um, I think there's been an oversight.
Do you uh, do you-ready for a refill?
You-you must choose Mr. Bing.
I know, but I don't think that's what she wants.
Rach, there is a decent place to...
Really? It sounds exactly the same to me.
Oh hey! You got my parent's gift!
Alright, just one. Wow, you're good at that.
Okay. Uhh, tortilla chips, yogurt.
Just put it on a plate and leave.
Well Ross, what did you think she was gonna do?
All right well, I'd better take that back.
Nothing, he's just really believes in that.
Really? 'Cause I could kinda use the money.
And I think he would tell you it was a mistake.
Yeah, hey hey, Happy Thanksgiving everybody!
All right now, memorize it. You got it?
We don't make enough fun of you already?
I'm sorry man, I didn't-I'm-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
But you got to be with both of them, right?
Ew! What is that? Something exploded!
Yeah, it was! All right, listen, I can't...
And it's not fake, it's totally brutal.
Good luck, and uh, take care, huh?
Well, it's always nice to meet the fans.
So the ah, play's pretty great, huh?
Oh man! Aren't you guys done yet?!
So, did you bring a little something for Ross?
No. No way, I'm not signing that.
Okay, what have we always wanted to do together?
Heard about the leg burnin' huh?
What, so I gotta shut it down now?
What? You never said anything about an audition!
Did she just ask me out on a date?
Hey! I'm in, they're gonna let me audition!
Then why are you wearing Monica's jacket?
Why would they take away our keys?
WELL, I DIDN'T MEAN IT!
How did she get me to settle down?
What? You ordered pizza without me?!
Yeah. And uh, I paid for the other half.
Well, she graduated from high school!
Hey Ross, will you pass me that knife?
The allergy guy got the part! Thanks!
Oh...I don't think it's going very well...
And that'll get rid of my wisdom?
I bet I stopped listening before you did.
Yeah he's lying. He looked down.
Whoa. Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Oh! Any word on casting yet?
Thank you! So, did-did he get it?
Phoebs, he's just a little dog. Ahhh.
Oh, let me get this. These are for you.
Your folks are really that bad, huh?
Hey! Wanna play some foosball? Please?
Ross has some big thing to tell everyone.
Because, I'm not wearing any underwear now.
Rach! Hey! It's fine! You're at Joey's!
Is this movie gonna be my big break?
If you ask me to stay, I'll pee.
No seriously... I'm really wedged in here.
What do ya say? What do ya say?
You are dogged man! I totally fit!
Oh, now you're tellin' us how you feel.
You know more than one Fun Bobby?
Hey, you guys, what are you doing tomorrow night?
Well what do I know?! I'm not a doctor!
Alright, alright. Woah, someone's flossing.
Hey that's what all my relationships are like.
This is for my boat, pretty cool huh?
We have to find the rest of the platoon!
I don't believe this... Have you guys been...
Looks like someone IS the ladies!!
This is how much we pay for electric?!!!
Oh. Okay. Hey, can I ride this outside?
Yeah, I know exactly what she's goin' through.
Yeah... I think we do... ... about what?
I need to say goodbye to the table first.
How about a scone on the house baby?
Why? Is it because I'm friends with Phoebe?
Oh, little party favours, check it out!
Sure. Coffee? 'Cause I'm going up there.
no... hmmmmm... it's not... hmmmmmmmmmm.
You got all that from the back of her head?
Whoa, wait a minute. Who's the father?
Nooooo! Being funny is your thing!
Are we watchin' the tape or not?!
Do you have any respect for your body?
Well, who's to say what's true? I mean...
Oh, no thanks, I got it. No I don't!
You partied with Hootie and the Blowfish?
Here you go. Let me ask you a question.
I didn't think anyone'd buy that, ok.
Joey. Hey Jake, do you like the Knicks?
So Pheebs, do they know about each other?
What are you doing? I said seven! Argh!!!
...Does the knuckle-cracking bother everybody?
That's not, prison lingo, is it?
At least I care about his feelings!
Oh come on Ross! Hey Ross-Ross don't...
Home is Home Star stew.
Oh, yeah, he rode the bus today.
All right, I know! I know. Yeah, it'll be okay.
Monica, pigeons learn faster that you.
This isn't the right room, sorry folks.
You're gonna mess it up let me do it.
Those two only had each other!
Look at this. My two best friends!
That's not whipped! Whipped is wh-tcssh!
Joseph Stalin. I think you'd remember that!
I have to pee. And Rachel's in the bathroom!
Yep! There's always room for Jell-O...
Chandler, Heckles was a nut case.
Thirty seconds left on the timer!
How do you think I got him in the first place?
I doubt it. Mostly regional work.
I'd really prefer a mountain bike.
Well, either you break it off with Ronni
Dude, I'm just trying to speak your language.
You know there already is a Joseph Stalin?
I'm not talking to you! You broke my fridge!
How do you get a monkey into a zoo?
Listen, uh, I don't know when I'm gonna see you again.
No, it's too wrinkly to be a mole.
Maybe we should check the trash chute.
We could get that Everest video though.
What about Game 1 of the Series?
That's okay. Chandler's the one I'm mad at.
Hey Chandler can I talk to you for a second .
You practice losing the Grammies too?
Isn't there any way you can keep him?
Wise choice, how many rungs?
Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman.
Warm milk and Excedrin P.M.
And, uhh, maybe the watering can there.
If you want I could loan you some money?
Hey-hey don't look at me! I just work here!
Feminist issue. That's where I went!
Yeah, sure. Go ahead. Oh, me, right!
Yeah, you're great! Okay, let's take it from...
That kinda sounds like your dream dude.
A place to entertain my lady friends.
I didn't do that! Who would've done that?!
Alright, alright. I'm around. Go ahead.
Well, lesson learned! Rachel is mean!
I now pronounce you... husband and wife.
I gotta tell you. You're the best in the business.
Look, don't you think that will be a little weird?
Oh, here I am, here's my big scene!
Hey you guys. Hey, you all know my dad, right?
Wait, well, where did you get it from?!
I said I think you're hot and now I'm embarrassed.
I do Rach. I do, and I so happy for you.
This sucks, I was just up by that much!
Yeah may-maybe you don't tell anyone about this.
Huh. What if I was sweeping a chimney?
Oh, oh, oh... What a dog says.
It may not be a bed of roses.
No, it's not, we have nothing in common!
Well if he's not gonna eat it, I will.
Joe Stalin. Y'know, that's pretty good.
Listen, buddy, we're just looking out for you.
Yeah-yeah, it's down to me and two other guys.
Woah. Why do you get to keep the table?
You wanna know wh...? You wanna know why?
Wow! Well then I'll just have to carry you.
You said, you wanna come in for some lemonade?
Oh man! I have to get those done too?!
Ross! Way to suck up to the family.
Thanks. Do you get a lot of guys in here?
Hey hey hey! Don't mind if I do!
Uhhhh.... he's not even wearing a jockstrap!
Yeah! You did! And that's why I'm leaving.
Alright, you want the truth? I'm thinkin' about it.
Hey! Did you talk to Dennis about me yet?
Sorry. Monica and Chandler are making love.
I got you something! Open it! Open it!
Please, just-just, just go and talk to Rachel.
Well, have-have you told him how you feel?
Whaddya think? Today's the big day!
Hey-hey-hey, hey! You can't. Okay? Ever!
Hey, hey, Chan. She could work for you.
You know, uh... Chandler got you a gift, too.
Yeah, I gotta, I gotta go to my room too.
Yeah, sorry, the swallowing slowed me down.
Well he actually saw you a little bit too.
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! I don't want to go. I'm having fun.
In the dream I did enjoy the closeness.
Yeah, see... you were all worried for nothing.
No dude, Ross tore up the tickets!
So you ah, ready for our last practice?
I'm sorry I gotta cancel tonight baby...
Pheebs! You're blocking the porn! Look out!
Hey, that pregnant girl's name was Erica.
Hey bear, I need some career advice.
...feel like getting a cup of coffee?
Ah. Hm. Wanna go to bed?
The hell with hockey, let's all do that!
Are you kidding? Phoebe, I would be honored.
You know, I had a chance to stop her too!
Can't help you, I'm not wearing any.
Look Ross, I am so-so sorry. I-I-I...
Then I don't know what it is. What's the problem?
So, system kinda broke down huh?!
What'd I tell you? What'd I tell you?
Uh, lame cool guy handshake, yeah.
So you've just married the one time then?
No! No, you smell like a meadow. I'm sorry.
How could you not remember that we slept together?
All right that's it, school is in session!
Uh, can I talk to you for a second, over there?
Yes I did! I'm Chandler. Dude, what happened?
So, you were both dorks. Big deal.
It's my house-warming present for Monica and Chandler.
I know, I know! What am I going to do? Ooh!
All right. But if you weren't my best friend.
You'd tell me if you were moving out right
Rachel's right. This is where you guys belong.
I know, it was the best I could get out of them.
What about me?! You-you just said I could!
Maybe this should be more of a quiet game.
Yeah. It's actually our first official date.
Ah, anything we might of heard of?
So then how could you I mean, how could you?!
But it happens? I'm gotta go to the bathroom.
Oh my God Pheebs! You're gonna have a baby?
There's a lost and found? My shoe!
Six months? Whoa that's rough.
Yeah, yeah and hey, I really mean it, dude.
Tampa Bay's got a terrible team.
Okay, fine, I will bring you a tape, huh?
You mean how they're friends and nothing more?
Actually, you have a little bit of an edge.
Y'know what? It was a stupid play anyway!
Come on! Who has the biggest boobs?
Just let her serve the beef-custard thing?
Hey! It's my fashion girls! What's wrong?
Hey! Hey! Be careful around my Porsche!
Yeah, Rach, I think you're handling that really well.
Hey, how come, uhh, Chandler didn't come?
What are you talking about alone? What about Ross?
Right, yeah. OK. Um, take care.
Ahh. What the hell are you doing to me man.
What, what!? it's for her hot friends!
And you don't a little good about donating the money?
Fungus! Yeah. Place is full of it.
Ugh, I cannot wait to ask her out!
Oh, what are you gonna do? You're gonna fire me?
It's still a tiny bit on fire there.
Yeah, toast, oatmeal... nothing that spatters.
Yeah, but, Ross, I mean, you're not okay with it.
Say hello to Reverend Joey Tribbiani!
But hey, Ross, this place is available now!
Oh, yeah, totally! That's such a turn-on!
Now? You want me to go over there now?
Have a nice six more months Ross!
You really should have been more clear about that!
And a couple of these little tiny boxes.
What do you like better action or comedy?
No-no, stay right there. Gettin' closer.
Is there anything we should know about the apartment?
Whoa, I didn't know we could date your sister!
If it's not you, this is a horrible story.
Right over there! Right there! Look-look-look!
When? Today? Some, not a lot.
Good, I uh, I saw a pretty big pigeon.
Look forget it forget it... I can't do it.
Yep, it's fat. I drank fat!
Yes, it's a highly controversial procedure.
Uh, Pheebs, you had a barrel for a dollhouse?
Nope-op! I insist! You get the wine right?
What? I'm not allowed to know smart women?
So that's it! It's over! Everybody knows!
What if I smack my head on the concrete?
Yeah! Yeah! That would be very helpful! Yeah.
Wow, this is wild. What're you gonna get?
All right! Everybody ready to go to the movies?
Oh... you got yourself a very weird deal!
Oh my God, it's Ross. What are we gonna do?
Hey, hey, check it out, guess what I got.
You guys kissed! Oh my-this is huge!
So are you gonna start taking this thing seriously?
Okay! Okay, you're yelling again! See that?
Oh, you told her you broke all the plates, huh?
Why would I return it? I love this bag!
Are they? I didn't know I cared that much.
All right, listen, Ross... you like this girl, right?
Ok, ok, How about if we split it?
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Treeger, what are you doing?
No! All right, who-who makes up the questions?
Oh! ah! eh... Britney Spears!?
And I like to think I had a little something to do with it.
Pizza!! We like Pizza!! Get out!!!
Well, I don't know. I think it does something to salami.
Hey, uh, you can't recycle yearbooks, can you?
No-no! No, I'm accepting it on her behalf.
Huh. Okay. So uh, I think I'm gonna take off.
Hey guys! Look who's back! It's Ray-ray!
Not now! These are my Thanksgiving pants!
Emily is kinda taking a long time, huh?
Hey, Julie, I didn't know you wore lenses.
But Phoebe, wait! Wait! Phoebe. Phoebe!
So, er... how did it go with Celia?
Are you kidding me?! She's gonna this boat!
Right. Thanks. It's June. I'm outta here.
Seriously guys, the trash talk is embarrassing.
Oh, come on Rach! My turn just started!
Yeah, lady, I do! I got a problem with that!
They want me to be totally naked in the movie!
Yeah, I'm... I'm kind of having a little problem.
Uhh, I'm guessing the threshold's clear now.
Oh, okay. I...I ate way too much.
Y'know, breadstick fangs are always funny.
Nooo, I said we needed a new plan.
Sure! I would love to wait with you guys! Thanks!
Yeah. Yeah, that...that's exactly it. You're right. Yeah.
That would be Casey. We're going out tonight.
Yeah! I'm fine! Thanks! Hey Rach, how you doin'?
Oh, man. What're the odds of that happening?
Oh well, she said we have nothing in common.
You guys are gonna have a great time, I promise!
Great! Hey! All right! Well-well what is it?!
Nonono, you can't kiss Ross, that's your brother.
Ohhh. I thought it was like Long Island.
Okay! We'll need a six-pack of Zima.
Because I forgot about our date, I'm so sorry.
Yeah. All right, now give me your best shot.
Uhm... oh... I don't know, it's too hard.
Oh. Ohh. Ohh, you're out of your mind.
All right, watch me! Okay, you time me. Ready?
I didn't know that! Well, what a pretty last name!
That's great! That would be great! Let's do that!
Well, I guess we'll never know whose it is!
What? Why not? Rach, who can you not get?
Oh, it's okay. You don't have to be so mean about it.
Why not? I'll keep the tank clean.
Ohh-oh, wasn't he cheating on you with her?
And I gotta go sell some Christmas trees.
No. wait a minute what was the little mermaid?
No, they're comin', we're waitin' right here.
Yeah, he's just really great to hang around with.
I set her up with this actor on my show.
No-no, things ah, finally happened with Kate.
So uh listen, I think I'm gonna take off now.
Hey Gunther, let me get a lemonade to go.
Alright. Cab driver number two?
Hey Ross, check this out! yeah, I can't do that!
Fine! Do you take Vasa or Mustercard?
It's just a game Mon. Rach, how about you?
All right, me neither! I was just testing you!
Power saw kinda got away from me there.
Argh-argh!! Ooh, soft. Is this mink?
Get outta here. This is our stop too.
Ah. All right. But my French was good?
Yes ma'am, ready to Power through!
Oh! Tell her she's not marriage material.
Oh my God, quick turn off the TV.
Yeah, you're roommate is a soap opera star.
Well, it comes and goes. I wouldn't trust it.
Okay, relationship, boy this could take a while.
Wanna play strip poker for practice?
Look I'm sorry you guys, I-I just don't think so.
Oh, y'know the same thing happened to me one time.
Yeah, whatever you need. Hey, you wanna go home?
But don't you need experience for a job like that?
The hardware store is right down the street.
Wow! Yeah I ah, I gave up a job too.
Nope. Op, wait! There he goes.
Why isn't that valet back with my Porsche?
Chandler, she doesn't understand a word of English.
Right, I guess. Alright, so see you at four.
I know, I know, but look at the knobs on her.
Alright, so...so tell me one of your moves.
Multi-colored robes! Ooh, and maybe a hat.

Why God?! Why are you doing this to us?!
Wow! That was good. That was... Tweezers?
The Empty Vase. Translucent beauty...
Yeah! Wow, your like from a whole other country.
Ok, all right, so I'll take her to the MET.
I couldn't help it, there love is so pure.
Hey, Phoebe, I asked you, and you said it was okay.
Wow! You guys seem to be having a good time.
Your sister stood me up the other night.

Ooh! Stop putting things down my pants!
I'm gonna say someone I'm gonna have sex with. Hey!
Yes sir! Yes sir, I'm-I'm-

Oh my god, I got my very own stalker.
Oh no, no, no, let your dad get this.
Come on man, you drove all the way up here.
And-and there's no danger to her and the baby?
All right, so we should go catch our movie.

Well, these really are the days of our lives.
Don't you ah, don't you wanna ask me any questions?
Well! What happened?! Did we miss it?
Oh, so your weekend was a total bust?
Well, unfortunately, I don't get many callbacks so...
Well, that one did not have Emma's face on it.
Correct! There's a possible backwards bonus!
Ooh, yeah, I'm not going anywhere for a while.
And that's how I know you didn't watch the tape! .
Oh my... How much do you weigh Ross?!
Yeah. Uh, does this mean there's nothing to eat?
Why would you ruin it, who was that hurtin'?
Mike, do you take this woman to be your wife?
How young is young Ethan? Young?
I will, really. I'll pay you back this time.
Hey! No! Get your France-going-arms away from me.
Of course I'm jokin'! I don't take checks.
Okay. Hey uh, when do I get to meet the robot?
Oh, here's where I win all my money back!
No! No, and I did not ask her to marry me!
I can't believe you. You told me it was a nubbin.
I don't know, she's, uh.... she's pretty great.
Hey! Don't do the crime if you can't do the time.
Alright thanks, Oh hey have you talked to Chandler?
No just, nobody press on my stomach.
Her name is Dutch, and also Marklan.
That's a nice picture. Maybe you can still have that!
I can't! I-I don't have any other clothes here.
Who cares? You're Rachel! Who's Kip?
No idea? Who do you think brought her here?
Fine, you want to get the birds, get the birds!
Hey listen, I'm sorry about what happened. . .
Yeah. You know why? 'Cause you came to me first.
Oh! Wait-wait! Is it my bologna sandwich?
I don't know. You dumped her on New Year's.
We're playing Strip Happy Days Game!
Do you think you can just buy my friends baby?!
But it is a big deal!! I have to tell someone!
"I am what you made me! You know what?"
Hey, you guys are still gonna come visit me, right?
It's the chick! She's...going through some changes.
Oh, hey Katie! Everyone, this is Katie.
All-all right! Start it up! Let's go!
Chandler! I don't need luck. I have thought this through!
Oh thanks, thanks! Now, I really have to get.
You-you have to pay that! It's not just a guess.
Hey! We were just sayin', great apartment man.
Why wouldn't she? He's a wonderful person!
Dude relax! It could happen to anyone.
Is that why you wanted to tie my tie?
Hey, now you're the one who wet his pants.
No, I gotta wear this thing for a couple weeks.
Personal thing? What personal thing? I don't know.
Oh man! They-they just redid my make-up!
Listen, uh, you wanna go get a drink or something?
So the Porsche guy took his car back.
He hooked up!! Tell us about her!
Will the stable boy never get the princess??
If you said it like that, you probably did, yeah.
Oh, thanks, thanks. Bye bye Jeannie.
Nothing. It's just old and dingy, that's all.
How? I guess I could break down your door.
Does that mean we have to bust it open?
Stalin...Stalin...do I know that name? It sounds familiar.
Sure, if you cared enough to call it first.
No, I'm not sleeping with your friend Jane again.
Hi! You uh, movin' in or movin' out?
What are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing?
Whoo-weh hey weh-hey whoo hey!!
Oh that's on the house courtesy of Joey Tribbiani.

Yeah-yeah-yeah, and they had that beer! That uh...
You were supposed to duck!!! Why didn't you duck?
Richard told Monica he wants to marry her!
Yeah, and you know what? We could do a lot worse.
What is Rock 'n' Roll about that?
This is unbelievable Phoebs, how can you be married?
Oh-whoa-wait, Gunther don't-don't forget your shirt.
Okay, good, so there you go. Go with Vince.
I bet 'ya ya I could fit in there.
I could use a challenge! It's getting pretty easy.
He forgot to leave his grip size!
Good, otherwise my watch would fall off.
Ah, now Rach, these ah, these little women.
Dude, you should've gone out once and a while.
Okay, imagine the best sex you've ever had.
All right, well finish your coffee; let's go.
Yeah, we know, but there's a baby suckin' on it.
I got that! I forgive ya! Don't come out here!
Here she is! Future fashion superstar!
Sure! But hey, you know this way sounds good too.
Don't worry, you guys, we're gonna get you out of there.
I think were not wearing the same shirt anymore!!
I'm takin' Ursula tonight. It's her birthday.
What're you talking about, everybody loves Joseph.
Oh it's water under the bridge, forget it!
I'm sorry, I just...I like things the way they are.
I'm not telling, you'll have to see it on TV!
And-and you won't blame us for any damage?
Oh, I am going to go for a walk in the rain.
Yes, 'cause we live together, that's a joke!
Wait, wait, we have a copy of your key.
Hey, when the doctor does that hernia test...
Oh, it was so amazing. After the love making...
I'm surprised you didn't go home wearing your lunch.
"Where'd you grow up," it's so simple!
C'mon, sit. Just sit down, sit.
Y'know what, I don't think we should listen to this anymore.
Dude! What are yo-you trying to kill me?!
Uh, hi. We uh, we used to work together.
Oh, you will when I pick you as starting forward.
Yeah well we should order some food then.
Oh, well think of it like this, when you're 90...
Unless you name your firstborn child Joey.
How ya doin'? Welcome. Good to see ya!
Oh, great, pretty soon they'll be back together.
I'd seen this thing on The Discovery Channel...
Phoebe! Don't put ideas in his head!
Maybe we shouldn't pay our gas bill?
I said a little bit Ross. Now, how about you Chandler?
Yeah, we'll call that Plan B. All right?
Okay, this is gonna be tough. Hold your breath.
Three tickets to today's Rangers game!!
I dunno what to say, Ross. Uh, it's a monkey.
Wh-wh-what's going on? Wh-what's this about L.A.?
Gettin' drunk and going to a strip club.
How long since you've seen a girl naked?
Well, maybe we can just tip the table a little.
She didn't have a birthday while we were going out.
She's this really boring woman. She's a teacher!
Yeah, and I'm a little tired from digging the hole.
Cute! This is Janice! You remember Janice?
No! No! No! No, I'm not going to punch Chandler.
Hey Fun Bobby! Whoah! Who died?
Whoa-whoa, what's the matter?! Talk to the captain!
Look, I got to apologize on the behalf of Carl.
You're really thinking about having sex with your brother?!
Hey, what happened to your fancy chef's jacket?
Come on, I'll show you guys where to check in.
Without that, you just got "lame with women".
Oh hey, do you still have their final exams?
Yeah, and when you do, he'll be lucky to have you.
Oh-ooh-ooh! Y'know what's a good visual aide?
There's one lucky to-go cup of coffee.
You usually find them on the 'heaving beasts'.
Done! I did it! Heh, who's stupid now?
Yeah, if I'm willing to sleep with the casting lady.
I'm saying maybe you and I crank it up a notch.
Oh my God! That's great! Congratulations! What's the story?!
Because! 'Cause... 'Cause you're my baby sister!
Okay, maybe he's not his best friend, but ...
Didn't I tell ya? Always showin' off.
What is the big deal? It's not like we're exclusive.
Oh, I'm so sorry. I don't know any Spanish words.
Audition? I thought you were gonna offer me the part.
Yeah! Oh my God! Is this what it's like to be you?
A spoon. Your hands. Your face!
Well all right so, it looks like we're even!
"Take good care of your Momma son."
Ross, did you really read all these baby books?
Anybody want to say good-bye to me at the car?
Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot you had that whole Rachel thing.
This guy says hello, I wanna kill myself.
OK, alright, the people who threw the water.
Double promise? Call me when you land.
Yeah bye-bye! Hey! So just a light layer?
Oh well, that changes everything! Y'know what Pheebs?
Ok-ay. I just, I can't believe you're calling me?
Hey, excuse me, would you mind switching with me?
Uuuh.. yes, they are my stuffed clams.
Oh no, were you upset? Did you lose sleep?
Great! I'm finally getting into this sailing stuff.
And I was tired from digging the huge hole!
Doesn't seem like it's going to work, I mean...
You didn't cry when Bambi's mother died?
Oh! That's Alicia Mae Emory's outfit!
Hey OK great, what would you do if I did this?
Get your non-believer ass outta my chair!
Great. You got anything that's not Ralph Lauren?
No, no, no! You kneed me in my misters!
I think I've been recognized, this happens all the time!
You're not stupid. You're meaner than I thought.
I'm gonna go down there and teach that guy a lesson.
Hey, this isn't about juice anymore, alright man.
What? That's the kinda thing you usually run by me.
Pheebs! Pheebs! Ross wants to kiss you at midnight!
Y'know, you look familiar. Do I know you from somewhere?
JOEY DOESN'T SHARE FOOD! end.
I'm telling you, Rach, Charlie is not right for me!
Yeah, with my mom. Yeah, not so much with my dad.
Don't make me more nervous than I already am!
When they're hungry enough, they'll come in.
Alright, who do you want as your emergency contact?
Shouldn't we all vote on stuff like this?!
Hey, dude, let me in. I got a girl out here!
Do you guys have like a big bowl I can borrow?
Poor thing. Cut down in her prime.
There you go! Keep going. Keep going!
Come on Pheebs! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!
Yeah-yeah I like that but just to go in another direction...
I want to make a ship to shore call to Chandler.
Oh, absolutely! You're talented and you're good looking.
Monica, I'm tellin' you, this guy is perfect for you.
Never hit a woman. Never hit a woman.
Actually its not pies, its just pie.
In Bizarro World!! You broke the code!
You guys need anything, 'cause I'm heading up there.
I met her at the library. I went in to pee.
Yeah, like you could find something as sophisticated as this.
I know! I mean it's not like we weren't cool about it.
Things that go "tssst" when you put them out.
Yeah, I... I don't want Stevie to see her like this.
No-no-no-no, no! Who, who were you talking about?
All right, all we need is a little lighter fluid.
That's right, all the ladies want to stay at Joey's.
Well, the reason I think Monica and Chandler are so great...
I was making a peanut butter smoothy, right?
Finally you guys made it. Pheebs, who the hell-uhuhh!
No, no. See, you and Drake are having a fight.
I'M CURVY, AND I LIKE IT!
Ohh, a hunk of sandwich from last year.
All right, give it back to me. 5 of hearts.
Do you think we'll get our three bucks back?
It's ah, step-ity, step and jazz hands.
Check it out, he's winning! Pete's winning!
Oh mama! Uh when-when is the baby due?
Hey, the ad alone cost 300 bucks!
No, I'm on right after this guy shoots himself.
Of course he's gonna have his Uncle Joey!
I wasn't gonna swim, I was gonna dig a hole!
Would she? You ate my candy bar!
Uh... How long have we known each other?
No you don't, I just saw you go in there with Monica!
He hooked up! He hooked up with someone.
Which we're still keeping under our hats!
Come on baby, don't go. Please? What do you say?
No, no, no! My talents as an actor!
So? Bring the dog back, you're a hero.
We should really learn how to play the real way.
You were right before. I mean, friends are so important.
There's like-there's like 300 bucks in this one!
Mmmm hmm! For your boob job!
Not like him, per-se, just not un-like him.
She's gone. She had a bag and she left.
Ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah! Enh? All right, what do you think?
Who would you rather sleep with Monica or Rachel?
Oh no, can't invite her. She also steals.
Seriously, that's your fantasy? To invest it?
Excellent. The shrew in particular was exclusive.
Hey, that guy's going home with more than a note!
I'm always on the swings! What am I doing wrong?!
If you want some privacy you can use my hole.
Uh, sit down. I wanna talk about our situation.
Here? In the hall? What are we animals?
What are you talking about?! I'm the lead in a movie!
Yeah, yeah, it's already generating Oscar buzz.
Oh, I got it! How about saying something like, "Monica...
Oh-ho-ho, yeah! Hey! Y'know what goes good with that?
Woah, woah, woah, woah. Which sister?
Uh yeah. Pheebs, listen about that. I only offered...
Well, get ready to come out of the non-gay closet!
Oh, you are the best friends anyone has ever had.
Na-uh! Hey did anybody lose their keys?
'Cause we will appreciate it more when she's gone?
So you've been sittin' around here all mornin'?
Hey-hey-hey, hey that's your wife you're talking about!
When you're off the phone, do you wanna get a pizza?
So Monica, still going out with Dr. Boring huh?
Yeah uh look Rach, there's something I gotta tell ya.
Yeah-yeah, yeah, with that-that uh, plumber girl...
Can I ask you something? Uhm, what's it like there?
Well, everyone will enjoy my music as well.
Hey, if it makes you feel any better, I do it too.
Couldn't have this conversation down at the truck huh?
Ok, ladies and gentlemen, wind your toys!
Well I got stuff going on in here if you wanna feel.
Whoa-whoa-whoa. What ah, what happened to playing the field?
Geez, sounds like you should be going on this date!
Can we come it yet?! We're dying out here!
It's easy, you just walk in on them having sex.
No! I would never do that! You-you're like my brother!
Hey. I was just gonna get something to eat. You want something?
You know, I'm really sorry I wasn't more supportive before.
And again, and again, and again... Hello? And again.
I'm tellin' ya that girl totally winked at me.
Ok. Well, how, how can we make it easier?
Hey uh, can I, can I talk to you guys for a second?
Uh, listen, I just wanna thank you for this great opportunity.
Oh, hey, you guys are finally gonna get to meet Kate!
I can't believe you said woowoo. I don't even say woowoo.
Woah, uh! Okay, let's hear your great idea.
Noooo. No-no-no, these babies sell themselves.
All right, I have one question. What is the deal with this?
Hi. I'm Joey Tribbiani; I'm here to audition for man.
Ma, I'm sorry. I just did what I thought you'd want.
Yeah, and there won't be a relationship left to rebuild.
Wow! Huh? Mac Macaveli, Private Investigator!
This is crazy! Hey look, I wanna switch to Rachel!
Look, I'll come to the party but I'm not dressing up.
That tone will not make me go any faster.
Uhh do you happen to have a hot girl in there?
Hey. Man, it is so hard to shop for girls.
Don't worry, it's out there! I think I just need lunch.
Yeah! Because this commercial belongs to me and Mitch!
Okay, fine, so now what, I just pull it off?
All right, I'm here, let's ahh, get this over with.
Yeah. Okay. Ross's treat! Where do you wanna eat?
Rach?! Rachel!!!!? So I can't do anything I like????
Ross, listen. I got two words for you. Threesome.
Dude, Phoebe's mom has got a huge peni...
Dude, what are you massaging an old man for?
Yeah, you can get a Volvo. If that's what you really want.
That's what this is about! Oh my God, you hate Ross!
No, no, no... what do... you can't do that to him!
All right, who got Chandler? 'Cause I uh, need to trade.
Yeah? Maybe we should talk about that for a little while!
Fine! Let's just go. I don't need your stupid dinner.
No! But y'know, I'm an actor, I'll act cool.
Well knock it off, you're supposed to be my friend.
Will you calm down, he's just a human guy.
I guess they weren't as good friends as we are.
You're right. Maybe I shouldn't even go on the call back.
And just wait for Rachel to come back from her date?
Tell me about it! "Unlimited nights and weekends!"
No, it's the pre-game. I'm gonna watch it at the reception.
Oh! Sure! How much? Two thousand dollars?
Wow. That's almost as much as a new book.
Yeah, my uncle Sal has a really big tongue.
I'm sure he's not more bummed out than I am.
Check it out. How much of a man am I?!
Give me a number, I don't want to owe you anything!
It worked! I scared ya, I knew it! Ha-ha!
Maybe I could be a waiter. Could I use the phone?
Oh my God! Those are almost right on the floor!
Look Chandler, it was instinct! Okay? I just went for it!
All right well, I'm outta here. Wish me luck.
No way are you cool enough to pull of Clint.
Hey Rach, so can I sing happy birthday to you now?
Oh wow, what a beautiful name! What is it again?
Right, and you go with Rachel, Bonnie's free tonight?
Oh yeah. I rubbed a magazine on myself earlier.
You've seen my huge stack of porn right?
Yeah. You're ten times prettier than she is.
Yeah. Okay. Whoa! I almost forgot this was on your...
Oh, y'know what? It's probably just your burnin' loins.
I still haven't gotten a check for your half yet.
Well, there was that one time that Monica and Rachel got together.
Don't you think I asked him that before he got in?!
Hey, I've done plays before. I'm a serious actor.
Wow, it is easy. Now, I can have milk everyday.
Oh-ho! I bet the British version is gooooood!
No, I don't think so, see Ross, because I think you love her.
Yeah, you didn't even use the tools for most of it!
Thursday's clearly not good for ya, pick a day!
Phoebs, that's OK. You took a big step today.
And-and-and not only that, I'm gettin' a new brain!!
Oh, name one friend of yours that I did that with.
Now, wait a second! You make food and robots?
Oh, we're having a big party tomorrow night. Later!
Did-did it make you wanna walk around in your underwear?
Haaaaa! Hey-hey, thanks for stopping our ball.
This is great, this is great, what else, what else?
No, no, I didn't mean you. But, you believed me, huh?
oh why don't you fly out there and surprise him.
Hey. Y'know with that goatee you kinda look like Satan.
Hold on. Hold on. Rachel coming. Do...Something.
Get out of the corner. Pass it, pass it.
So ah, Phoebe tells us you write jingles.
It's better! You can't go to a museum in your underwear!
Ooh, sorry! No-no-no, so close though, but-bye-bye!
Oh my God! Is that why you guys had to get married?!
Ohh. Wow! Well how-how, how will you be gone?
Oh, like you've never gotten a little rambunctious with Ross.
How about 'cause if you don't, his mother might.
Uhm... Yeah... this uhm... raccoon came in...
Yeah. Yep. Yeah. All right, well uh, I'd better go.
No-no-no! We gotta go! Come on! Here we go.
Look at you. Since when do you roller blade?
How bad do you want to stick your tongue on that?
Ross!! We're having a surprise party for Rachel!!
No! No! No Ross! I'm not hot! Are you hot?
Hey, you know what naked card game is never boring?
Strike three! You only get one more, Mike!
Sure. What? About uh, you showering with your mom?
How you got three women to marry you, I'll never know.
No! Not unless! Look this must end now!
So, did you uh, find anyone to marry you guys yet?
Pheebs, you gotta stop this, I working on commission here.
No I'm not. Why would you say that? That's just mean.
Right, of course. Hey, did you guys finish the speech?
I don't get it. I mean, I was so sure this was what I wanted.
I don't have a key, they took mine to give to you.
Right, they uh, they choppered me in. What's up?
Oh, he was this cab driver we had in London.
You own the room. We should probably get-get uh...
Oh man. Please tell me one of 'em is Ma.
Y'know what Ross? I'm not gonna let you get away with this!
Look at this, how did I spend so much money?
Hey everybody, look who's here! You remember my grandmother!
Okay dude! Hey you uh, you sent Kristen flowers.
What am I gonna do, I feel like I'm losing my friends.
Well I'm wanna hear it, because she keeps doing this.
Yeah! But that is not what they're looking for. OOOH!
One guest? You told me I can have six tickets!
Ahh Pheebs, you know you're still my number one girl.
Yeah, unless you hook up with a bunch of pigeons.
Why are you going? He said, she wanted the shrew!
Woah, woah, woah, uh, no Shannon Cooper.
No. But I got Knicks tickets for you, me, and Chandler.
Dude, stop talking crazy and make us some tea!
Okay, okay. Wait till you hear who I got for Ross.
No, no, that's not what I meant. Let's get you a cocktail.
Okay. Sorry about that... Uh, so where's C.H.E.E.S.E.?
No, I-I figured you would've picked a blond guy.
Isn't it? And it's engraved too, check it out.
All right! So that's it! It's over! Everybody knows!
Ooh! Well played, Phoebe Buffay, well played.
Yeah, listen, before I forget that side is still wet.
It's the big night! We wanted to wish you good luck!
Oh! I know how you can get him, take off your bra.
Whoa-whoa, but her birthday isn't like for another month.
No, I'm performing the ceremony. I'm not wearing a tux.
I can't believe you're so uptight about your mom comin'.
Yesterday's pages did not reflect my best work.
Well you gotta kiss someone, you can't kiss your sister.
All right, Jester man, look we wanna see the king.
"I, oh, I can't. I want to, but I can't!"
But you can't stay with Phoebe, Ross! We're-we're roomies!
Like you wouldn't believe. Wow! This is a great place.
that would've been better, I'll try that Hi I'm Joey.
Uh, aren't we kind of in the middle of something here?
Ahh, I'm gonna go get some chicken. Want some?
I could teach you a speech that I memorized for auditions.
Naa, no. This is the part I'm actually good at.
I don't know! But he did not eat your face cream!
Well Ahh, yeah! Yeah, sure, a drink sounds great.
...look both ways before you cross the street.
Oh ... Happy birth ... oh, see you later.
You know those posters for the city free clinic?
Listen uh, could you put Kathy on, I wanna apologize.
You're a masseuse. You have a table with a hole in it.
That's not the point Chandler. The point is that you lied.
You don't keep it over here on this table any more?
All right, don't waste it, I mean its still food.
What's a matter Ross? What you're nervous about your speech?
Not anymore. So anyway, how do you want to pay me?
Oh, is today the day you're gonna tell them about you two?
Maybe you are a nurse, but you moonlight as a waitress.
All right, turn around, I got to get a look at this thing.
No, no, no, don't get up, I got a cooler right here.
Me too, but I guess I do have a couple of more-
Hey, y'know what a really good rainy day game is?
Hmmm, soup! Hmm soup! Hmm, soup!
If you didn't want to play, why did you come to the party?
All right, it's another commercial; I still haven't told her!
No, come on Ross! Look, Ross, we have to get past this.
So what? Look, suppose we were a divorced couple.
I'm gonna take that book and beat you to death with it.
Aw crap! Okay-uh...uh let's-let's do the rings.
Yeah. Yeah, that looks bad. But I didn't...I didn't propose!
Okay, let me just get changed and we can go to dinner.
I know, right? Wh... Wh... Why are we doing this?
Get out! I couldn't stop if a meteor hit me.
How can you say that?! The Mets have no closer!
I can fix it. Hold on. Look out. Look out.
Well OK then. Was that the oven timer?
Hey!! I need to relax! Okay? I was working all day!
Yeah, well you didn't call and leave your grip size.
Whoa, ah!! We're you just gonna give me some lemonade?
Chandler, if it really hurts that bad you should just tell her.
Please, I was trying to be nice, you're the worst one!
Well, I can't do everything! Look back over your time together.
Supposably. Supposably. Did they go to the zoo? Supposably.
All right, I'm gonna go say hi the chick and the duck.
Yeah, I guess, but what's like heads and what's tails?
Well why don't you just reach out and take his trampoline.
Guys, do you think we should ask Ross to come along?
But I counted, you're not supposed to live here! Oh man!
Hmm, soup. I mean, noodle soup. I mean soup!
No, I'm not questioning it, I'm saying it's stupid! What?!
Just kiddin,' I'll talk to them, you distract Rach.
Y'know, I'm beginning to see what Jake was talking about.
The sky's blue Ross and I had sex yesterday!
Ooh... I can't believe I'm kissing you. I'm kissing Rachel!
That's not gonna happen. No. Because we have a new deal!
You forget how many great songs Heart had.
B-bye Janice. So when ya' dumpin' her.
Yeah-eh-eah! Oh-oh, sorry, I-I knew what he meant.
Monica. Oh... huh, I always thought it would be Rachel.
They're takin all my stuff back. I guess you were right.
Aww man! I can't believe I locked myself out again!
All right! Now you go get that beautiful pig! Oink!
Uh huh, sure, yeah. How can you not remember me?
Hey, Chandler, you got a minute? I-I really need to talk to you.
What!? But I already bought my ticket to Bermuda!
Fine! Now, where'd we land on those pancakes?
Aaron! You gotta let me go. The guy's hammered!
Oh, okay. Phoebe, do you take this man to be your husband?
No-no-no, please-please Chandler I-I-I would owe you so much!
Yeah, Ross, way to ruin it. I was just going to get dressed.
your right! I love my life! I actually did sleep with her.
Uhh, are you saying that you're not entirely happy about this?
Huh? Days of our Lives picked up my option.
Later! Oh man! Hot girl! Hot girl!!
Thanks sweetheart. Give me a little sugar here. Okay.
You should both know, that he's a dead man. Oh, Chandler?
I just have to call my agent and tell her I can't do the part.
The Silly Putty! It's not so silly anymore!
Yeah, yeah. Hey, why don't you give a pull on that rope?
Hey, cut him some slack. It was Chandler's idea.
No, smile! Not that face, smile! Everybody smile!
Hey Monica, why are we watchin' the business channel?
That's fine. I'll just have a Tic-Tac to hold me over.
Y'know what? Bring her both, and I'll have the same.
Uhh Pheebs, I heard that. Can you put him on?
Sure. Here. I'll uh, save your parking spot.
Hi, uh, I'll be reading for the role of Mercutio.
Oh really! Where? Somewhere funny I'd bet!
Really, hey, you mind if I turn the heat down?
Monica, have you ever been with him when he wasn't drinking?
Come on Ross, be a good guy. Step up and do it!
All righty, what do you say we head back to my place?
What about me, he? Only had one lunch today.
Hey... hey listen... What do you guys know about investments?
But what if uh-and I'm not saying she will be-But...
That thing was a hazard! I'm very safety conscious.
Hey, you wanna do Joey a favor, maybe you go out with Joey.
All right. I'll give you one hint. Warren Beatty.
Well, I was hoping after tonight that maybe I could you know...
Okay. "Hey, Timmy, I've got a surprise for you."
Hey, Monica bought a bed from the Mattress King?
Yeah according to the news, most of the city did.
Uh, uh, we'll flip for it. Ducks or clowns.
Uh.. is it ok that I still think it looks delicious?
Why would they do that?! It was a good show right?!
All right! Man, this is unbelievable! I mean, it's great, but...
Yeah, o-o-o-o-okay anyway, I just wanted to say I'm sorry. Here.
Okay, this is it. It's my big fight scene coming up.
Because I think this character is going to be suspicious about stuff.
I'm gonna be in the waitin' room, handing out cigars.
Totally! I would love to spend New Year's with you.
And what's cool is, the character is from Naples, right?
What the hell does a paleontologist need a beeper for?
All right. Chandler, do you remember how I told you about our fridge?
Whoa! What are you doing here? How did your date go?
What?! Wait-wait-wait! The handsome man was about to enter!!
What? What the hell am I doing? You just broke my fridge!
No, but I hear lyme disease is open, so...
So stupid, ordering cheesecake, trying to be healthy.
Uhh, this is it, this is how we're gonna die. Ready?
Dude, are you okay? And when are the fajitas gonna be ready?
Hey, you can stay with us! We'll take care of ya!
Hey, that's never gonna make it all the way over here, buddy!
Thanks, you are such a good friend. And this is so weird.
You all right Chandler? Is there something funny about that name?
Hey, Mon! I'm not doing anything, why don't you fire me?
Okay you guys, I got a little more written. Are you ready?
You like someone. Tell me who it is. Who is it?
I dont care. Phoebes Phoebe. Ursulas... hot!
Orrr, you could follow him and see where he goes.
And a 50. Huh, these must be Chandler's pants.
No! No! No! For my new fridge-our new fridge!
All right, so. How did it go at the fertility clinic?
Awww, man! He promised he wouldn't take the chairs!!
No, but with this new car smell, you'll think you do.
From the land down under? I didn't know that either!
David Lynn! David Lynn! David Lynn!!
No wonder Rachel had to read this so many times.
Because Vincent, we were lovers. For two years!
Then you gotta come clean with Ma! This is not right!
So what does that mean? Are you guys getting back together?
Uh, well they might be a little mad at me over there.
Uh, wow, you just said a bunch of stuff I didn't know there.
Oh wait, before you tell me what it is! Okay, what is it?
Oh, great! Can you believe I found it on the second floor?
Oh anyway, I just wanted to say how wonderful I think you are.
I've gotta see this. All right Ugly Naked Guy!
No way. I've been going to the guy for 12 years.
Absolutely! And if it doesn't, can I get the extra ticket?
Yeah, but after Denise DeMarco, I had to promote it.
Check this out? Huh? Yeah. That's the stuff. What do you think?
Hellooo? Anybody in there order a celebrity? OW!
All right, it won't go down any further. It's stuck.
I was going for quiet desperation. But if you have to ask...
Maybe I could give thanks for you shuttin' up, eh?
No way! I've been going to the guy for 12 years.
Ross. I was thinking we could just go down the fire escape.
Looks like that no date pact thing worked out.
Oh, can you believe they gave Stephanie skin cancer?
Yeah! Why don't you stick around. You can sit right there.
Oh, I was reading it last night, and I got scared, so.
Yeah, is Sidney there? Oh, this is? Sidney's a woman.
Don't blame me, I saw it on The Discovery Channel.
Hey? what? what? wey! whoo! what? what!?
All right, all right maybe-maybe you should just ask her to leave.
Soon, soon, I'm gonna be on soon. There I am!
I hate that thing, it's like a... bolt of lightning.
Yeah, I saw her this morning walkin' it by the park.
You don't seem to understand. See, I was Dr. Drake Remoray.
Seventeen-fourteen Giants... three minutes to go in the third.
Hey, y'know what you guys? I think I'm gonna go walk her home.
: That book got me through some tough times.
How is "Monica, I love your sweet ass," inappropriate?
Yep. Hey, what do you say we make it a double feature?
I suddenly had the feeling that I was falling. But I'm not.
Aww, me too. Now let's finish this and go to bed.
I'm tellin' ya, he hasn't moved since this morning.
Some of the words are a little too sophisticated for ya?
If you get a second, find out where she got that cheeseburger.
Hey, does somebody wanna hand me one of those tiles.
This is my friend Rachel. Rachel, Kash, Kash, Rachel.
I can an A? In-in school? Hey, I'm a dork.
Look, does someone mind switching to sit with Charlie?
So Pheebs, where are you doing all, your bell ringing?
No they're not! They're ugly and stupid and delicious!
"Oh, Chandler, now, now, that's it. There, faster!"
Oh-oh, yeah-yeah, I bet all the sex makes it easier!
Hey, woah, let's go down there and get your hat back.
I'm gonna miss you, you're the hottest roommate I ever had.
No-no, I don't really have any money. Not yet, anyway...
Hey! Uh, Monica? Chandler? Can I talk to you guys for a second?
Oh, and guess what, I got an audition for All My Children.
Maybe you need sex. I had sex a couple days ago.
You can't just give up! Is that what a dinosaur would do?
Yeah, definitely, definitely. Ok, what do you wanna see first?
Oh hey, don't worry. I'm still ordained from your wedding.
Aw, come on! It'll be years before I forget you!
Uh listen, here's your Soapie. I accepted it for ya.
Please don't fire my friend. Just let me talk to her.
Okay, if you say so. All right, ready? Set! Go!
Well, I figured we're in another country, so it doesn't count.
Hey, how much did you guys tip the super this year?
Oh really? That'd be great! You guys can be the contestants!
I got a big date coming up, do you know a good restaurant?
Yeah really, Ross, have you ever been beaten up before?
But uh, uh, what about uh, Ross and uh. . .?
Oh, Richard's here. I should run down say bye to him
Sorry, I just, any excuse to tell that story y'know....
Ooh! Yeah. So yeah, so you know exactly what I'm talking about.
Yeah, but what if he doesn't? He's such a good duck.
Look, we were way out of line, we totally support you.
I'll kick that door in if you give me a little sugar.
God. He's crazy! Why doesn't he want to be with Rachel?
Hey-heeyyy - Look at that, it's a Christmas miracle!
But only in the moment. So do ya wanna kiss again?
Not likely. 'Cause you see that body bag right there
So.... back to your place...you thinking, maybe... huh-huh?
Or not. Uh, Rach, why don't you just move in with me?
Okay! All right, I'll see ya. We got it! We got it!
Hey-hey-hey-hey, if you're gonna start with that stuff we're outta here.
How little are they? I mean, are they like scary little?
I uh, I just came by because I-I want to talk to you about something.
So, you're not mad at me for getting fired and everything?
Hey-hey-hey, I think we might find out the answer to our question.
Uh, Pheebs, how long do you think this lady'll be with us?
Hey, so, uh, how's it going living over at Ross'?
Dude, I'm sorry. But hey, there's one spot left, right?
Olive loaf and ham spread, no mayo.
That's your move? Boy Rach, you're lucky you're hot.
Got it! Hey hey hey! Where do you think you're going?
I'm Joey! I'm an actor! I don't know squat about dinosaurs!
So that if we went out on a date, shed be there.
Yeah-yeah, I noticed that! Is that 'cause she's so passionate?
Oh, I've been there. Yeah, I am gonna go drive my Porsche.
Kinda, but I've just been having way too much fun.
Ahaha, he might as well just give us the points.
In that case should I make sure it's on real good?
Her first cookie? She has cookies all the time!
Oh! It all looks so beautiful: the turkey, the stuffing...
No, I-I just heard lunch. But yeah, I can go. Sure!
No, I'm picking you up for our date. These are for you.
Is it her fault that some of them didn't make it to you?
Oh whoa-whoa-whoa, no roommate stuff. Okay? We're on a date.
Good for you. Uh, quarters or rolls of quarters?
Well down at the adult video place down on Bleaker.
Get him a bone, get a bone. You gotta bone?
look I don't usually ask out women that I meet in coffeehouses.
Are you kiddin'? When they shoot you out of that cannon.
You can't have S-E-X, when you're taking care of the B-A-B-I-E!
Oh my God! Congratulations Ross, because Chandler, you've been Bamboozled!
It was unbelievable! I walked in there and she was all over me.
All right, well I guess I'll just have to do what I do on dates.
Uh-huh, not as high as... It worked! King!
Oh yeah, I always picture your Mom when I'm having sex.
Have you ever slept in the same bed as a monkey?!
Hey Mr. and Mrs. Geller! Let me help you with that.
In the woods. No wait-wait, that's the joke answer.
Yeah! Y'know, she could use a little... Oh nice shot!!!
An annulment? Ross! I don't think surgery's the answer here.
What?! How could you do that, how could you think she was Mary-Angela?
I know, she may be the hottest girl I've ever hated.
Noooo... Three Blind Mice goes like this...
Closed set. We know but we're friends with the monkey.
Oh uh, well I just came in for a cup of coffee to go.
Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Or, or I'm the one who dates her.
Yeah, so we just keep trying and trying until we... do it.
Have you ever tried to sit through Citizen Kane?
Sure, it looks stupid now, there's no music playing.
Whoa, dude, look out! You almost crushed my hat!
So what are you doing bringing her here?! There's people here!
Really? That's great! You and my sister, sittin' in a tree.
Guess what? I finally got that seed out of my teeth.
Oh! And so the miracle of life begins, and aaiiyyyeeee!
Dude, if you go back out there, you're gonna be Dead Ross!
Oh yeah? Hi, Ken Adams, nice to meet you.
Oh, no don't worry about that, I swallowed that years ago.
Uh Cecilia Monroe, she plays Jessica Lockhart.
Remoray. It's Portuguese. We need that information; I'm a doctor.
What-what are you guys doing here? I thought I told you not to come.
That guy's like a cartoon. What do you see in him anyway?
I guess I'll get washed up then. Watch that sunrise.
Oh yeah? Ross, how many items left in that bag?
Wow! There's a lot I didn't know about vomit. In a minute.
Look, I understand if you came by to hit me, I deserve it.
Well I uh, got what I came for. I'll uh, I'll see you guys.
Hey! Now I'm a man of the cloth, but I still have feelings!
No, I'm not! And it wasn't a hop it was a pademarie.
Ohh, then no. Maybe I should hear those specials again.
I'll be playing Drake Remoray's twin brother, Stryker!
Uhhh, I was an impulse buyer, near the register.
Well, what if they came in third in a modeling contest?
Uh so, will-will I be reading the same scene again?
Well, so, will you help me? I really wanna be in this play.
Okay... Well maybe now I'm not okay with it not being okay.
Ahh, wait, is Wendy the runner-up Miss Oklahoma?
So? Who would you rather have kiss you, me or Chandler?
But Ross, Ross. What do you, what do you think she's going to say?
Ross bruises like a peach. He bruises like a peach.
Wha...? You're gonna go now? I thought we could hang out?
So! You and Phoebe huh? How long have you been going out?
Oh, but when Phoebe has a problem, everyone's all ears!
Oh that's nice. Happy birthday Rachel, here's some goo.
Oh, they're so cute! Now, what, what kinds are they?
Yeah, poor cat, never saw that big butt coming.
A hamster? What, those things are like 10 bucks.
Well it's okay, its like... its just a football game.
Hey, how much cash do you got in your pocket right now?
Hey! That's the day after I stop menstruating! This isn't mine.
No-no! No way! Joey Tribbiani does not take charity...anymore.
No, eh, oh-oi, easy, it's not a hot dog!
Imagine a protective porn bubble if you will, okay?
Haven't you ever read the same book over and over again?
Okay. I got nominated for my part on Days of Our Lives!
Look, it's one thing not to cast me, but to lie to me?
But plus, it would be wrong and weird and-and-and bad.
No! Forget her, man! You don't need her, you don't need that!
Yes! Guess who's in an audition for a Broadway musical?
Me too! There's a game on Tuesday do you wanna go?
Y'know what? I think that's enough for today. Thanks for your help!
Huh, un, blu, bla, flu, flenk!
All right, then you'd better show me some of that too then.
Well, I've been better. But, I'm all right. So you like her huh?
Oh this is great! I might actually get to play Ben's dad!
Well, this-this-this was great. Didn't everybody have a great time?
Oh, hey, hey, can I give you guys your house-warming present now?
Yeah, sure. Well y'know, earlier she was talking about geography.
Eyes! No, no. Your eyes! No. Chandler's eyes!
Oh! Sorry. Uh, I've got those plans with Phoebe, why?
What? Rachel, listen, have you ever heard of Fortunata Fashions?
Or... just get a card that has a poem already in it.
It's no big deal. Hey, y'know, you do what you gotta do. Right?
Of course it does! It's smart! I used the the-saurus!
Kinda looks like that stuff you get when you get a bad infection.
Hey, but at least you got that cool, pregnant lady glow.
Fortune! This guy is so stupid. It's Count Rushmore!!
Oh, you said it Mike. Aw! There's got to be a better way!
Whoa, that doesn't necessarily mean that he's breaking up with you.
That's great. But uh, I'm not really expecting a lot of calls.
I figured, take a guess, help a charity, free boat!
Ah, our little ones are growing up fast, uh?
Ah... Hey, so this roommate of yours...is he good looking?
No! You don't want to wreck it, you don't want to go to fast!
Hey, is uh the rest of my candy bar around here?
It's a... It's a "welcome home" sign for the baby.
Yeah, look, we were just saying, this whole thing is really stupid.
Yeah. I understand. I understand. Man, I wish I saw Phoebe first!
How could someone get a hold of your credit card number?
Or ha-ha, we could go over there and pee on them.
A book? Is it like a book that's also a safe?
That's ridiculous! I'm not a "Star," just a regular famous actor.
Uh, I get Leslie out of the coma and then we make out.
Well, the tough thing is, she really wants to have sex with me.
What're you doin' here? Aren't you supposed to be out with Rachel?
But between you and Phoebe, I'd have to give the edge to Phoebe.
Uhh, excuse me is there a Mr. Bowmont at this table?
Rach we had to get out of there because, look what I won!
No reason, I'm just saying that uh... That's where I'll be.
Yeah! In fact, to prove how much you mean to me, here.
Well, there are so many things, it's hard to pick just one.
No, no, it's okay, I already told the waiter what they want.
See, this is why I don't date women who read. Uh-oh.
And Chandler I can't believe I let you pay for this one. Thanks man.
I don't know, I was kinda hopin' no one would ever find out.
You have any idea what this'll do for your sex life?
Hey buddy, do you think I can borrow your uniform this Thursday?
No-no-no, I'm serious. You don't smell it? Something's on fire.
..ah, what're you doing here? I've been trying to call you.
Oh hey listen I got us tickets to a Knicks game tonight.
Thank you! Well, I guess now I know who I'm taking to the awards.
Well, I guess I could sleep with her... I mean, how could I do that?
Wow? Wow what?! Wow what?! Who you-what?!!
Oh, 'They are warm, nice, people with big hearts'.
Wow, that's in like 20 minutes. You'd better get dressed.
So uh, you and Mona, been a while now. How's it going?
It's okay, it's okay Rach, it's me. Put down the scrunchy.
Okay, so what are we going to do about this hand twin thing?!
Oh, hey, my pleasure. So what are your intentions with my Phoebe?
I would like to meet him. He sounds like a stand up guy.
Hey, what about the scene with the kangaroo? Did-did you like that part?
Who says that wine has to cost more than milk!
Whew! Stood up to fast, got a little head rush.
Are you kidding me?! I love Archie! And the whole gang!
So you like the nachos uh? Myself I'm partial to...
Closeness-shmoshness! There was three of us for crying out loud!
Okay, I got it! This place makes the best sandwich in the world!
Oh-oh-oh, yeah! That's right, you take good care of those babies!
So we'll leave before it's over, we'll be back in time.
All right! All right! Uh, umm, Super-Speedy Speed round!
Hey Ross! That art stuff worked, you hooked me up.
Oh, I know how we can decide. Phoebe, show him your game!
I'm sorry, it's the pigs. they're reluctant to get in the blankets!
I had a dream once about a fax machine that did that.
I don't know, maybe I can't. I mean, maybe there's something wrong with me.
Thanks for coming Mrs. Greene. Well, ok, you take care.
Very good! Drawing on your own experience, I like that!
I know, and only one layer of jam?! What is up with that?
Oh, that sounds like fun, but we've got a ring to find!!
Which is why I waited until now to introduce you to Mike.
Hey, Monica, wow you've been in the bathroom for like a half-hour.
Oh! Oh, well! At least we're both having fun!
You bet I do! I just ah, wasn't listening then, that's all.
Okay, I'm all right, okay, but hey, could you just leave your lips?
Why wouldn't ya? Erin is great! Then-then there's you guys.
Hey, what if I said, I could even things out for ya, meatwise.
Hey, Chandler, that table place closes at 7, come on.
Uh, y'know, starve a fever, go to a play for a cold.
All right! Here we go! 1999! The year of Joey!
Hey, is that when you wrote salt water taffy man?
Well nothing yet, they really hate you and I want to fit in.
All right, I'll take a box of the cream filled Jesus's.
You spent a hundred dollars. That's the limit. You're screwed!
C'mon! Just try to picture her not pregnant, that's all.
But the drawer full of take-out menus is okay, right?
Well, maybe he's, maybe he's this really cool pharmacist guy.
Actually, tomorrow night kinda depends on how tonight goes.
That was a test. Good response. All right, full name.
You're ready to have a baby? My boy's all grown up!
Yeah. Uh, oh, OH, the best part, c'mon. Heh?
Ah well, the ah, Pennsylvania Dutch, come from Pennsylvania.
So I just talked to one of the DOOL writers today, and...
Hmm. Do you sleep with women and never call them again?
Yeah! I made it of this fruit bowl I found in the garbage.
Well, maybe a little. I wish you hadn't seen me throw up.
Really? Oh uh, oh just give me five more minutes with it.
Awww, one of my students got an audition. I'm so proud.
No you can't do that, where would the chick and the duck live?
Good call. Yeah. But, the face Ross, the face isn't Rachel.
Ross, did ask us first, and we set that night aside.
Hey, y'know in Roman times this was more than just a hat.
Fine. Gang up on me! I got you all right where I want you.
Man, this is a long drive! Are my eyes open? No!
Look, just because I know about you two, doesn't mean I like looking at it.
First of all, Utah? Dude, you can't just make stuff up!
Waiting for my Grandma to finish my laundry. What about you?
Man. Can you believe he's only had sex with one woman?
Okay, now the Mastodon is from the semi-late Jurassic period.
Oh, Kath, we should get going. We're going to by hamsters.
Uh, I scratched it on the ATM machine down on the corner.
Ahhh! My ah, my agent said it wasn't a dancing part.
I will be doing a dramatic reading of one of Emma's books.
Mornin' Pheebs. Well, my movie has officially been canceled.
Can we drop this? I am not interested in the guy's apartment.
When was the last time someone told you just how beautiful you are?
It'll kill him. I mean it'll, it'll just kill him.
No they can't! They were stupid enough to get knocked up!
Shhh! Not so loud, we don't wanna wake up, uh...
I, ah, I never said hate, I was very careful about that.
You shut up! I love arguing with her. I'll be right back.
Yeah, I mean it's never taken me a week to get over a relationship.
But then who? The waitress I went out with last month?
It'll be great for next weekend. I mean, it'll be grrreat.
Oh, hey, how about this? Wanna be an extra on my show?
Do you think he saw us or can we still sneak out?
Sure, yeah. I don't have time to say thank you because I really gotta go.
Hey you're right. Yeah, it's kinda been like us again a little bit.
Okay, really good. Anyway I gotta go; I'm late for work.
Now I can't believe it! What? Rachel's pregnant? Who's the father?
Okay, you hide my clothes. I'm gonna do the exact opposite to you.
What are you still doin' here?! I told you, lobster ravioli!
Uhhh, yeah. Yeah. But uh, I don't think it's the kind you're gonna like.
Phoebe. Whaddyou think a good stage name for me would be?
Right. Okay. Losing the robe. And the robe is lost.
Hey Chandler. Come on in. We're knitting pot holders.
Bye bye Mike!/Cya mike!/Bye mike!/Bye bye now!
I thought you paid. Ha, guess we won't be going back there!
Oh, it was amazing. You know how you always think you're great in bed?
Well uh, I had breakfast here so technically I saved $3.50.
Hey Kash. Uh hey-hey this is Ross. Ross, this is Kash.
No, no, it's not, don't listen to him! I'm gonna thump you!
I don't! No, I wanna live with the super-hot Australian dancer.
Where are you going? The vicar won't be home for hours.
See ya! All right Pheebs, I am ready for my first lesson.
See, didn't I tell ya these pillows would be a good idea?
46. Wow! Who's well educated now, Mr. I-forgot-ten-states?
And I got them a book on Karma Sutra for the elderly.
Strip joint! C'mon, you're single! Have some hormones!
"I can't. Oh, I want to, long pause, but I can't."
Here we go! Here we go! Here we go! How you doin'?
Wow Dennis Phillips! That's great! How did you guys meet?
Oh my God. So that's it?! I only get to bring one guest?
Leetch spots Messier in the crease- there's the pass!
Hey, y'know Ross, I think I kinda understand why I kinda lost it today.
Theres the waitress. Excuse me, Miss. Hello, Miss?
I'm so bored! Stupid rain, we... we can't do anything.
Right... ok, so just from the top of the page, right here.
Okay. Yeah. Listen would you uh, would you like to have dinner with me tonight?
Well, I couldn't do it. I told her I didn't want to get the part that way.
Sometimes I get in here just to get away from it! Hey, a nickel!!
Thanks. Thanks, but uh actually it's just gonna be me again tonight.
So you need someone who knows fashion, to tell you what looks good.
I didn't have to tell you that!! I'm stupider than Jane Rogers!!
Hey, look who's here! It's Joey, and he brought home a friend.
Because, Monica, the guy's so good, and I really, really want this part.
So! Stryker Remoray huh? When do you want me to start?
Even nicer when everyone gets to wear their underwear..
'Cause I only have one quarter, and I think my time is about to-
Don't worry, Chandler, it's not a globe of the United States.
No. No. But I'll go see a normal person movie with ya.
Come on Rach! Look, turning thirty is not that big a deal.
Yeah!Hey, you just have to promise not to get yourself thrown out again.
Yeah! Help me get this mini-fridge past the security guard.
Yeah, someplace nice. How much do you think I can get for my kidney?
Hey Robert, could you ah, ha, pass me those cookies?
Hey! Great, you're home! Guess what Phoebe got me for Christmas!
Damnit! Is there no mystery left in romance anymore!?
And it is a love that is based on having and giving and receiv-
I know; that just pushes them further and further apart.
I guess you wouldn't believe me if I said I was Kurt Douglas, huh?
Oh, so we didn't win, but it's fun to play the game, right?
Well if it's free food, how come you're charging me for it?
What are they doing out here? The coast's all the way over there.
One! No ten! You said ten! You can't take that back!
No! I am not a pervert! Okay? It's just... I just... Kinda...
All right, I-I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You see Rach I'm an actor...
Oh man, pizza? I like pizza. Put olives on the pizza.
No. Y'know how we're always saying we need a place for the mail.
Wow! That was incredible! Beard of bees, here I come!
Oh, she's putting Emma down, she'll be over in a second.
I swear to god, Dad. That's not how they measure pants.
Look at that, Charlton Heston eating a liquorice whip!
Is that true? If I keep reading is Beth gonna die?
Me too. In fact, I think I might be a little too comfortable.
Well you're whippin' so slow! Can't you do it any faster?
Good, me too. Eggs and milk are in the fridge. Thanks.
Thanks! Okay-okay check it out! Picture? What picture? Eh?
I'll do it!! It'll get the casserole stink off of mine.
But what about back home, anything going on there? Anybody you like?
Sandy! Hi! C'mon in! ...You brought your kids.
What do you have against the duck?! He doesn't make any noise!
No, no, it's not a girl, it's... a brand new Hugsy!
Hey, we all had better plans. This was nobody's first choice.
I'm sending back all this stuff that Chandler bought out of guilt.
Yeah! Ask them if they brought their friends any souvenirs!
aaw-ahhh-aaahhh STOP! STOP! I'm worried about damaging my head.
Almost cried huh? Hear that Chandler? Almost cried!
I finally get a part on TV and the monkey's makin' movies.
All right back off! I gotta gun! I'm not afraid to use it!
I'm Joey. I mean, I'm disgusting. I make low-budget adult films.
Oh well I think I am, yeah and I think I'm definitely gonna get the part.
Anyway! Her and Ross just started yelling at each other.
Oh yeah, it must be tough to keep your hands of him, huh?
Oh, you wouldn't know a great butt if it came up and bit ya.
Because, I know what I like and what I don't like! It's not the same thing!
Now that you're a couple, we don't get two presents from you guys?
But the audition's in a couple hours and I don't even understand the game.
Look, I don't hate Janice, she's-she's just a lot to take, you know.
Wait, here's one. Uh, would you be willing to cook naked?
We figured we could be late because you guys were gonna be on time.
Well to tell you the truth, they uh, they had a problem with the bag!
Hey. Ross, I know you're pissed at me, but we have to talk about this.
"I am what you made me. You know what? I could go right now."
I don't get it. What happened? What about everything you said under the bridge?
I gotta do what I gotta do, you gotta do what you gotta do, you just do it.
Oh uh, I don't know the boat way to say this, but uh never!
All right, I guess I can hold out a little longer. Let's have a game.
Well, that's pretty good. But you might wanna tone it down a little.
I'm so sorry. Look, if it was up to me you would never leave the show.
Oh, I'm gettin' heat from the guy in the hot pink thong.
Well, I'm feeling really insecure about the one we are shooting tomorrow...
All right well, y'know...I guess we know what we have to do to get down.
Whoa, whoa, no, no, I-I'm not playing with this guy, now.
Wait, wait, wait. You want him, I want her. He likes you.
Okay wait-wait p-please be cool! Okay? I work with this woman.
Well, you're timing couldn't be better. She's not my girlfriend anymore.
Yeah-eah! 200 dollar reward, split five ways!!
Why would I do that? It took three guys to get the thing in there!
I don't know! How about, "Thanks for taking the message." Jeez!
That's 'cause sometimes I just do it through my wall to freak you out.
Hey, you can't say you're breezy, that, that totally negates the breezy.
That was a good one. For a second there, I was like, "whoa."
Hey, hang up! You get food poisoning just talkin' to that place.
Boy I tell ya, that judging stuff took a lot out of me.
Chandler? What're you still doin' here, I though you guys took off.
One pregnant woman at a time, please! I just want you to be okay.
Don't worry man, I get to bring a guest. We'll show him.
Thanks Ross. I really like that bird though...I'll take the dog though.
Whoa! Okay. Yeah well, who-who was in World War I?
Okay, Monica picks ten, I call nine! Anyone else?
Hey-hey-hey, if my friend says it's time to go, it's time to go.
Well that's it. I'm done. Whew! There come the meat sweats.
Really? Me? Wow! I don't even know any huge gay people!
Hey Mon, do you have another pillow? Y'know, something a little snugglyer?
So I'm thinking, basically we pick it up and then we flip it.
So uh, hey, that uh, that wedding ring, huh? Man, that's nice!
Does a good teacher say, "Put down the beer pinhead!?"
Hey, hey! You said you're gonna wear a thong, where's the thong?
I love living with you so much. I just wish things didn't have to change.
Uh hey look uh Ross, look I think we need to talk about before.
Bedroom is clear, although you might need some new pillows.
Hey, look, I don't need you getting all judgemental and condescending and pedantic.
All right, all right. "Damnit Braverman, it's right there on the chart!"
Yeah, yeah. It's like my chance to give something back to the acting community.
Unless you wanna practice the Foxtrot again? Or-or the Tango?
Ah, he can't make it, he said he had to his... Whoa-oh!
Oh yeah. These are my old work pants, Sergio Valente's.
Hey what do you say, we move this onto the likes of the couch?
: Pheebs, have you ever been bitten by a hungry Italian?
Oh great. Hey! Go take off those pants, they look ready!
I bet Ross was in on it too. I mean he was conveniently busy.
Uh, excuse me. Jerry is the director, which one's he?
Look, it's a nice gesture, it is. But it just feels like--
Yeah. Hey, remember when she brought up that thing about the three of us?
Uh, waiter, one more plate of chicken wings over here.
And I ah, borrowed some of your cologne. I hope she likes it.
Enough said, I'm there for you man. Where is she, upstairs?
Oh, I don't watch soap operas. Excuse me, I have a life, y'know?
What the hell's the matter with you?! This is my favourite jersey.
I know! That's why we got to find Monica!! You know where she is?
Oh I-I uh, found the keys and now I'm just polishing her up.
I'm sorry, it just-I don't know it doesn't really look like it can do anything.
When you say used, do you mean eat as a pre-cooking snack?
My friend Rachel has a kid. I totally know nursery rhymes!
And Rachel. I would've told you but they made me promise not to tell!
It's hard, y'know, his huddle is closer to Dutch girl.
Nice going. You just saved yourself a couple months of sex.
Yeah, then-then who's the guy that painted the faces on the mountain?
Oh, a couple of nurses asked them out. Maybe they're with them.
Will you pick one, just pick one! Here, how about that one?
Careful! You're wasting good pastrami! Oh my God! I'm my dad!
Well, I'm totally over it Chandler. Friends forever! Don't come out here!
Water breaking, what do you mean? What's that, water breaking?
I-I did! I told her everything, Chandler! But she wouldn't believe me.
Well, actually the last place you were sitting was in there . Soo...
Six years? Wow... It's almost as long as highschool...
If you wanna get back in the car, we need the wire, your call.
Oh uh, hey Pheebs. Uh y'know what? I'll-I'll come back later.
Hey! Now, we're not actually gonna be sleeping in her, but do you mind?
They sent me today's script! They never send the script!
Yeah, we just don't happen to know any women that know how to play poker.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. You just want to put it on your hand!
Okay, look, I think we have to tell Rachel she messed up her dessert.
Y'know what? This is not fair to her. Let's just forget the tape!
I would sooner die in this hellhole then see her back with you!
Still, that really sucks, man. Especially on Valentine's Day.
Come on! Admit it! That was the best nap you ever had!
Now, y'know the bee probably died after he stung ya.
You don't own a TV? What's all your furniture pointed at??
No! No, that was Jack! Rachel thinks I asked her to marry me!
I just wanted to come by and y'know, wish you good luck on your date.
Oh, yeah, that. All right, means that much to ya, I'll let you have her.
Check it out, check it out. Heckles' high school yearbook.
Okay, you picked the Gimmie card! You get all of Ross's points!
Or.. we could flip a coin, and then multiply the..
Hey, if Little Joey's dead, then I got no reason to live!
Uh-huh. And I named them Chick Jr. and Duck Jr.
Mhm, maybe she used them with another boyfriend. Maybe Richard!
What kind of profit is that?! And you call yourself an accountant.
I don't know! I haven't totally decided how to talk on my boat yet.
You said I had to give you the chair, you didn't say anything about the cushions.
Who cares?! You went behind my back! I would never do that to you!
Ooh ooh ooh ooh, there's no room for milk!
I have to go to the bathroom too, but I don't want him complimenting my thing.
So I uh, I just talked to the director. That's it, we're done for the day.
Ooh-ooh, Pheebs, you want a strong name? How about, The Hulk?
All right, car magazines, cereal boxes, but it's like enough!
Hey Ross, listen, you want anything to drink, 'cause I'm heading up there.
Rach! Rachel! Okay, the next highest bidder is at table one.
What? Yeah! Sure! Uh, look at the uh, the reason...-Is it hot in here?
Look, my agent hooked me up with six tickets to a great play.
But what you saw, that is the extent of it, okay? One kiss.
Okay, uhh, would you rather be too wet or too dry?
Listen, I ah, went to that restaurant that you were talking about last week...
Oh my God! Oh! Hey, can I have an aquarium? And a sex swing?
Maybe. So this is the living room huh? Ooh, it's pretty dark.
Do you know how hard this is gonna be on him when he doesn't get it?
Right. Goodbye Erica, good luck in Salem. Take care
Yeah, I had to teach Ross my bit because I actually didn't get a callback.
I knew that! I sooo didn't know that, but you should see your faces.
Oh wow that's a great idea! And I still have his credit card.
Ben, Ben, hey Ben. Nothing. I don't think that's his name.
I tried to call you from the coffee shop, and there was no answer.
Oh-no, don't try and talk all normal with that thing in your ear.
Me too! Yeah. And comfortable. Do uh, do you like leather seats?
No hey Rach, it's cool okay? Y'know I'm a loner too! Right?
Dude-dude, who would you rather have kiss your sister, me or Chandler?
Man, I wish Ross was coming with us! Y'know? I'm gonna miss him!
I had to read the Bible pretty carefully, but... yeah we do.
Really, a shower huh? And uh, which-which room might that be?
Eggs. Who's eggs do you like better, his or mine, huh?
Oh well, Chandler and Monica are over there and it's kinda hard to concentrate.
Yeah, was there a part of you that... felt like it was... really wrong?
Uh yes, but it was, we just did it once uh, in London.
I don't know who made you the boss? All right? We invented this game!
No! No-no. Look, there's a bug stuck in tar right here.
What, you think I'm gonna tell a girl I like that I'm also seeing a cup?
Okay well, I was down on one knee with the ring in my hand.
Would you guys want to come down tomorrow and watch me tape the show?
Yes we do! Now look, that was the best nap I ever had!!
Hey, Gunther. Can you uh, can you cover for me? I just got an audition.
Whichever one you want, man. Whichever one you want. Not that one.
Yeah, here we are. Uhh... I... I think I'm...falling in love with you.
I can do an English accent?! That baby's going on my resume!
Well, you suck! But at least you suck at a man's game now.
Absolutely! I could be a vegetarian. There's no meat in beer, right?
For one thing, the guy on the tape said I was doing a good job!
Oh, ah, tour guide at the museum. Yeah, Ross got it for me.
That's right, you're not. You're a nurse. You're Nurse With Tray.
Noo-no-no, no, those are nicknames. I'm the chick and Chandler is the duck.
Yeah, in my third drawer on my dresser. You don't want to lose that.
C'mon show us what you bought. . . You know you want to.
You sure? Some extra crispy? Dirty rice? Beans?
I know, it was amazing! I mean, we totally nailed it, it was beautiful.
Ooh. I-I don't know Chan. I'm not so good with remembering lines.
Oh, no. Ah, I playing your husband, Victor. I'm Joey Tribianni.
So what are we gonna do?! We have no reinforcements! No-no food!
Come on! What are you doing?! I'm in character! Would you talk to her!
You hung up on the pizza place? I don't hang up on your friends.
Uh, we stars just try to eat right and get lots of exercise.
Yeah, I think we said good-bye to that when we invented hammer darts.
You know what you should've done, you should have told yourself that little story.
Easy there Captain Kirk. Oh, do you have a bobby pin?
Hey, I got one keyhole and about a zillion keys. You do the math.
Let me know about that coconut phone, it might great for the boat.
: Ahhh, that's alright. Y'know, that's a tough hand to beat.
Rachel, there you are! Come on, let's serve that dessert already!
Oh wow! Okay man, I'm sorry. I did not mean to make you feel bad.
What? Ace is high! Jack, queen, king, ace!
Oh, sometimes we use the same extras for different parts. It's okay.
Dude, if you think Fireball's relaxing, you've obviously have never played.
All right, he likes you back! Huh? Told ya, you should go for it!
Well, since you ask. They want me back on Days of Our Lives!
Well, let me ask you something, was Kip a better roommate than me?
Oh yeah? Well, you don't know about Hugsy, my bedtime penguin pal.
That's good, just keep rubbing your head. That'll turn back time.
Well, that was only 'cause I used the red one to unclog the drain.
All right! But uh, listen, what do you say we crank it up a notch?
Come on you guys, we want you to know we're very very sorry. Right guys?
No. I was told the name of the movie would not appear on the bill!
Thanks, man. And oh, while you're at it, could you get her a card?
Hey Rach! Hey, you mind if I read my comic books in here?
Uh.. who has to die for me to get her? Commercial Break.
Terrible! I messed up every line! I shouldn't even be an actor!
And remember whatever comes up first. Okay? And hurry, because ...
Maybe now you can actually do it. You know? You can finally get over her.
I didn't look at it. Stupid baby's head was blocking most of it.
So, you know I'm filling in for Phoebe's step dad, tomorrow, right?
Yeah, he did, look... look, it's right there on the counter! Ha-ho-ho!
Uh, listen I gotta double check for tickets tonight. Who-who got what?
Man, if anyone asked me to give up any of you, I couldn't do it.
Okay, I'm in my sweat pants. Bring on the food! What's the matter?
You should scream at me, or-or-or curse me, or hit me.
All right Carl, we're next. Now remember, what is not gonna be?
Y'know what you guys? I'm uh, I'm gonna go too. And uh, I'm sorry about everything.
Hey, that'd work on me! Why did I get to buy Mrs. Butterwords?
Come on man, you know I'd do it for you! Because, you're my best friend.
Man With Eye Patch! You get in there and you do your job.
I never laughed so hard-Did you see the wine come out of my nose?
Umm, no. No best friend, no. Just a lot of close friends.
Hey, are you cool with this. I mean, I don't want to leave you high and dry.
No! No. But ah, try the classifieds, people sell everything in there.
Yeah and we'd go check it out, but you took away our keys.
Phoebs, check it out, check it out, check it out, check it out.
I know, but don't you think the sick thing is way better than the play thing?
Okay, here's my big scene. My big scene's here! Oh my God.
Hey guys. Listen uh, you wanna get some dinner with me and Kathy tonight?
Really? In the moment, I really wanted to kiss you too. In the moment.
Yeah, my agent just called me with an audition for Days of Our Lives!
Okay, it all comes down to this. Whatever happens, happens. Destiny.
Yeah, so no one touches the remote. And no one touches the TV!
That's right, he almost could. Which is exactly how I got stuck there.
Oh yeah, that's just a little something for my huge gay fan base.
Oh, oh! Maybe we can lure them out. You know any birdcalls?
Is it on me? I feel, I feel like it's on me! I got, hey!
No, no, no, don't say "listen." I know that "listen." I've said that "listen."
Wow! I'm so sorry; I had no idea it would bother you this much.
Oh umm, my big scene is coming up. Big scene coming up.
Oh man! Aren't you guys done yet?! I wanna sit in my chair!
That wasn't a real date?! What the hell do you do on a real date?
No-no-no, I think I'm gonna see how things go with Kathy. She's pretty cool.
Kinda have a... a thing for the Days Of Our Life's people.
Oh really? Well, maybe you and I go out for drinks? You're the other one right?
Monica what're you doin'? You can't go shopping with her? What about Rachel?
That sounds like another word to me! Are you gonna take this seriously? Okay.
Hello? Oh, hi. Yeah, hold on a second. Ross, it's Julie, for you.
Fine, I'll rent a car and drive...! Ross, you have to get that job!
Ohh, great! Oh hey, listen Ross, thanks for being so cool about this.
Well, then it wouldn't be a secret. So yeah, that would be okay. Yeah. Yeah!
Y'know what? I think that's enough for now. Yeah. I don't want to be over rehearsed.
I got one. Which one of us do you think will be the last to get married?
Yeah, I uh weighted like 27 pounds when I was born so...
Well, I was thinking about that and I, I think the best way would be, to not.
Oh! Well that's it! He's the last one to go. I'm locking you guys in.
The reactor's gonna blow in three seconds, we're never gonna make it!
That's it? You know, it seems all you do lately is drop the ball.
Ahh, forget about it, I'm havin' a ball. How's the apartment doin'
What? My hands are totally clean, I just gave the duck a bath.
Thanks, yeah. I love this but ya know what, it makes me wanna pee.
Yeah, it's like a cow's opinion. It just doesn't matter. It's moo.
Wow! Well, uh... Hey! I'm really happy for you guys! Congratulations! See you later.
Oh No-no-no-no-no-no-no! He went over to Ross' to bring the dog back here!
Hey, Chandler, can we please stay focused on my problem here?! Y'know?
Hey, for what it's worth, with Rachel I don't think you'll ever be just "anybody."
Ok! Stop it you guys! Stop staring! You're freaking me out!
I'm serious. You're amazing. You know when to spritz, when to lay back.
Aw! Does that mean the Sam Goody's sale is over?!
Sure, yeah. Will you just keep an eye on the chick and the duck?
Hey, how much will you give me to eat this whole jar of olives?
Oh uh, ordinarily I would love too, but I am just swamped right now.
Yaaahhh. Ahhh, candles. What'dya thinks gonna happen here tonight?
Gimme a box a juice. Well, they switched me over to Hombre.
No, but it's okay. She just came in and gave him a hug, that it.
If you hated the bracelet so much, Chandler, you should have just said so.
Now hold on a second, fifth floor against that back wall?
How come Richard looks so much cooler with one of these than me?
Well, when Jake did it I saw that...he was wearing women's underwear!
What can I do? Look, I don't want to do anything to screw it up with Ursula.
Would you let it go Ross. It was just a dream. It doesn't mean...
All right they got water, orange juice, and what looks like cider.
Oh yeah, he looked like a real lumberjack in those pink laceys.
Chandler is a complex fellow, one who is unlikely to take a wife.
What they're not invited?! Oh no, that's terrible! They're gonna be crushed!
A couple? Like two people? Like one , two people?
Well no, I'm just in a coma. This must mean I have lines! Oh...
I know, I'm sorry, but can I just have a quick second to run to the bathroom?
Hey, is this person who decides whether or not you... get a baby?
Yeah! And you have so many more choices than you do with men's underwear!
I can't tell you what I'm wishing for! Else...you know...won't come true!
Well maybe I got a little upset and maybe I told them where they could go.
Whoa-whoa-whoa. Jokes? You guys know they have naked chicks in there, right?
Who cares, we'll eat at the sink! Come on, let's play!
The part I want to audition for is a fireman, this is so meant to be!
Oh uh, hey. Not as good as this guy! He brought Twizlers!
Estelle, you gotta get me some work. I-I lost my health insurance.
RACHEL PLEASE!!! JUST HAVE DINNER WITH US!!!
Re! Re! Then I can watch that! Rewind it! Rewind it!
Well, not that its any of your business, but, no, we havent, okay?
Hey, don't get mad at us! No one forced you to raise the stakes!
Oh-Wha-Ho! What are you middle naming me for?! I left you a note!
Yeah, you can fire her, but I would call security, she won't go easy.
Oh hey, don't worry about it man. Don't worry about it, no big deal.
Well, there's gonna be strippers there. He didn't say anything about no strippers.
Oh, wow! I'm so sorry, ok? I promise, we'll do better next time!
I don't know, birds just don't say, "Hello, sit here, eat something."
Oh, that's cool. We have interns at 'Days Of Our Lives'.
Well-I got a head rush from standing up to fast right there.
Okay. Years ago, when I was backpacking across Western Europe...
Yeah! And also, a little like a French guy. I never noticed that before.
I say, 'I am there!' Cool! Aw, is Ross going to?
Know what was great? The way his smile was kinda crooked.
Bijan for men? Bijan for men? Bijan for men? Hey Annabelle.
All right, look, I'm not proud of this, ok? Well, maybe I am a little.
Hey, I'm with you. He even asked me if I thought you'd go out with him.
Hey! So, what's with the 20 percent tip? Did I do something wrong?
No. no... eh... she went shopping with Rachel. Why? What's up?
Whoa-whoa-whoa! You're not gonna use the pay phone to call work, are ya?
Hey! How is New England not a state? Huh? They have a sports-team!
Yeah, it is. It's really tough. Y'know sometimes I think-Wow!! Nice move!
Come on man! You never want to do anything since you and Janice broke up.
"I thought I knew who the enemy was, but it was you all along."
What? I...I just figured since you're pregnant you're not gonna be seeing people.
Relax. Here hold this . This old stuff just comes right off.
GET THAT LEGLESS WITCH OUT OF HERE!
Ten. Okay. Now Tag there's such a thing as to many women.
Here she comes. Hold on, I'm gonna make your life much easier.
Hey you guys I'm gonna take off. I just wanted to let you guys know, say goodbye.
C'mon, you're going out with the guy! There's gotta be something wrong with him!
Just... seeing what it'd be like to be a paleontologist... it's fun, yeah!
Come on man, just-just let the girls stay, I'll do whatever you want.
I knew I shouldn't have mentioned it! That's what I wanted to name my kid!
Umm, listen, Ross do you really think this moving in with Rachel is a good idea?
Thanks for stopping by. See ya! I-I am so sorry. I...
I can't hear a word you're saying, my ears are ringing so bad.
Look, which one of us is gonna be having sex in there, me or you?
There was chocolate on the three. It looked like an eight, alright?
Well, you seem pretty insulted by that. What? I'm not good enough for you?
Just watch it, and if you don't like it, you don't pass it on to your bosses!
I know! All right, I'll see you guys over there! I'm off to fight the Nazis.
Yeah, I just got off the Internet! Man, there is a lot of porn out there!
That's always appropriate! Oh, okay. One more push! One more push!
Oh what, did someone outbid you for the teapot? Oh! Secret teapot?
Ohhhh, good one! And Yemen that actually sounds like a real country.
Oh, no no no. Its for Ursula. I just figured, you know, size-wise.
I do! So much! I can't stop thinking about her! I can't sleep, I-
Hey, you can cancel plans with friends if there is the possibility for sex!
How about zero down and zero a month for a long, long time?
Well then help me get it off! Plus, it smells really bad in here.
Hi Alex! And uh, as you can see my hands are not in my pants.
We've been stood up. And we want our free crab cakes.
That sketch you mentioned? Might it have looked a little something like this?
Actually I rent the whole place and, I just got what you meant. Thank you.
Uhh, I don't believe in these crazy diets y'know, just everything in moderation.
Correct! Which monarch has ruled Great Britain the longest?
Can I use your phone? Yeah, the number for a Sidney Marks, please.
No, Pheebs, listen, if you decide to do this, we'll be supportive like crazy.
You could say: "Hey Kenny, how come you're not Britney Spears?"
All right, fine... But if I enjoy this, you have only yourself to blame...
I was with you the whole time we were in Connecticut, when did you even get those?
Morning! Hey, how's my favorite genius and my little robot buddy?!
Yeah, but, hey look, don't go through her stuff. She gets really mad.
Actually, that will be long. You know, I really need to organize my thoughts.
Monica face it, Chandler is against marriage. And-and always will be!
Well, he's gonna. I'll see you a little later, ok? Hey, how ya doin'?
Why do you have to break up with her? Be a man, just stop calling.
Oh yeah, sorry about that. Mob mentality or whatever, I don't know...
Yeah, this slow roasted salmon, just how slow are we talkin' here?
It's my VISA bill. Envelope one of two. That can't be good.
Hey, no matter what happens with Ross and Emily, we still get cake right?
No! No. Don't do that, just next time make sure she really likes me.
Chandler! You are not gonna believe this! I have found my identical hand twin!
Probably not. Nah. I don't know how much I'm gonna wanna play after you go.
Say hello to the new champ of Chandler's dumb states game.
What is wrong with me. It looked more delicious when it was a penis.
No! It's not okay! It's not okay at all!! You're dead inside!!
And about this Nancy thing... If you're not sleeping with her, should I?
Look, we probably should have talked to you about this before it ever happened, but..
Come on, season tickets! Season tickets, do you know what that means?
So what if he didn't come! We can still go out and party ourselves!
We're geniuses! Yeah, look at them, look at them, they're really bonding.
Yeah okay. Even though my tax dollars paid for this car.
Well, if she's my friend, hopefully she'll understand. I mean, wouldn't you guys?
Incredible! I met the director this time and you'll never believe who it was.
Okay, it's an audio question, name this television theme song.
well that's not even the weird part. I don't think she remembered sleeping with me.
Yeah, I think that'd be best... So, so I'm gonna... I'm gonna take off...
But you're still moving in together, right? Because my ad came out today.
Morning. I just uh, came by to pick up my mail. Where's the mail?
Hey you guys, check it out. Check it out. It's like it's coming right at me.
Nice!! Yeah! Is that part of your resolution, your new thing for today?
Yeah! Well, well really it's three. Please. You're so good at it. I love you.
Great, I'm finished! In fact, I just dropped it off at the agency.
Hey that's not true! Look at uh, look at Angela Lansb-Angelina Jolie!
Uhh, do you mind sitting there. I'm-I'm saving this for my friend Ross.
I just got this really weird message from Ross. He said turn on MTV.
I know, I'm so bummed. Can we have our free crab cakes now?
Oh yeah yeah. I process. People want the processing, I'm the one they call.
It's two gifts in one. It's a pen that's also a clock! Huh?
I'm gonna miss these little guys. It was nice having birds around again.
Look, we're not throwing it out! I built this thing with my own hands!
Yeah. Ya know what I think; I think we were all just being too negative.
Look, it's too late, and I got an audition. I can't shop anymore! I...
Oh my God! You did too? It totally freaked me out, what was that?!
Wow, is this friendship? I think so. Check it out, we're bracelet buddies.
It is so amazing to meet you. I'm such a big fan of your work.
This is where I keep the pizza. And-Hey! Where did the napkin go?!
Yeah! And I like to hang out in a quiet place where I can talk to my friends.
Hey! What are you guys doing here? I thought you'd be out partying with Gandel-worf.
Come on, please, it'll be just this one more, well actually it's two.
Yeah, but it's not gonna last. She's too much for me in bed. Sexually.
Oh, well we watch it a second time and its Die Hard 2!
Nice, nice. Hey I got somethin' for you. [hands Chandler an envelope.
How about Tony's? If you can finish a 32-ounce steak, it's free.
'Cause I figured you'd hooked up with some girl and she'd left it there.
I got it from Monica. She sold it to me for a very reasonable price.
Fresh squeezed orange juice, with pulp! Just the way you like it.
Hey no, seriously, I don't need you to pick me... Alright! It still works.
All right, my New Year's resolution is to learn how to play the guitar.
Okay, listen, hey, Ross. Why don't you try to relax, okay? Maybe have a drink.
Nooo. I had a story all worked out but then Chandler sold me out.
Calm?! I wasn't calm! I've never been more scared in all my life!
Shoot! Shoot! Shoot! Shoot, or just fall down. That's good too.
Aww, man, he took the five of spades!! Oh, no-no-no, here it is!
Hey. I spent the night out. I met this cute bridesmaid. She is so...
Uh, for your information, since they hired a very hot weather girl.
Oh God. Uh, okay, here's the thing, this is the thing, okay, the thing is...
Yeah! And-and things aren't as...smashed down as I thought they were gonna be.
Wow! Maybe uh, maybe you and I ought to get to know each other a little better.
Yeah, try sticking it in the freezer for 20 minutes. I'm tellin' ya!
It's not what you said. It's the way you said it....Oh My God, I'm a woman!!!
You can come over and watch the Super Bowl. Every year, all right?
I still can't believe they took away my key. You trust me with yours.
No, no, no, no, that was - that was just for me. Are you sure about this?
What are you talkin' about? I never left you! You've always been my agent!
Yeah, turns out our kids go to the same school. Small world huh?
Rachel's having her baby!! Which is of no interest to me, I'm a neurologist.
Hey I was crying because, because nobody believed Quincy's theory. Okay?
Hey, it's a lot harder than it looks! Okay? She-she-she's hurting me.
All right. Hey Rach, while you're in there, throw something on Alicia Mae.
Hey Chandler, while you were sleeping that guy from your old job called again.
Fine, fine okay. But I gotta say technically, I didn't even do anything wrong.
What? Are you out of your mind? Lets throw some jello on them.
Right. Ok, ok, uh, ducks is heads, because ducks have heads.
Well, I only said that because of Ross, you know. Then I saw him kissing Charlie...
And that's just in the city. I get her up to 160 when I take her upstate.
Oh yeah, lava spewing, hot ash, of course some are dormant.
A monologue? I don't have.. I got it. Aah! so... I'm gonna take off!
Somebody was using his head. Hey, let's check out the rest of the place.
Relax okay, I-I-I can get this open. Anybody have a coat hanger?
Oh now-Hey Ross-Ross! Do you wanna-wanna come in for a beer or something?
Well, at the Christmas party him and Santa did some definitely gay stuff!
Whoa, whoa. And the fact that you dumped him because he hit on Phoebe?
Kathy was being really nice and you just walked away. I thought we had a deal.
yeah but she should remember sleeping with me I am very memorable, you guys know.
Six and a half! You knocked that last one out of my hand! Remember?
Hey. How come you're answering your own phone? Where's your crazy assistant?
Whoa, Monica runs a pretty tight ship over here. What are you doing?
Oh, hey, Lauren. Uh, you guys this is, this is Kate's understudy, Lauren.
You can come in, but your filter-tipped little buddy has to stay outside!
Wow! I can't believe this! This is incredible. I mean you just won an Oscar!
Hey! You guys! Remember that audition I had a while ago and didn't get the part?
Chandler gave me word of the day toilet paper. I'm gonna get some coffee.
What's not to like? Custard? Good. Jam? Good. Meat? Gooooood.
Ah... Chick Jr.? Duck Jr.? Don't hide from mama!
Maybe, maybe we did a good thing, helping Ross get back on his feet!
Oh, ain't that nice? The three of you trying on slutty lingerie together.
OK, you've got to promise that you'll never, ever tell Ross that I told you.
Oh, I like that, yeah. Wasn't at the parade because I had a family emergency.
We, we come back from our walk and the- the phone was ringing...
How's that pig-in-the-blanket workin' out for you? I wrapped those bad boys.
If you want, I'll sell my friends and use the money to buy you presents.
Hey, so how'd it go with Julie? Did you, did you break her heart?
Yeah, Chandler finds me so intimdating that it's better if we're on the same team.
Excuse me, could we get an egg over here, still in the shell? Thanks.
It's not what you said. It's the way you said it... Oh My God, I'm a woman!!!
Have you heard about a little something called, Not Making Girls Cry.
Guys! Guys!! You gotta let me nap! Ugh, I'm gonna get cranky!
All right! There is something. I kinda had a dream, but I don't want to talk about it.
Ahh-oy! That was the underwear I was wearing that night in London. Right Monica?
I discovered I'm able to count all of my teeth using just my tongue.
Tell me about it, I feel like I'm holding down the fort all by myself.
Well she better get here soon, the outlet stores close at 7.
I don't know. I might stay there for a few days while I look for an apartment.
Ow, I'm just going over the script now! You wanna read lines with me?
All right, come on look, Ross can take care of himself! It's not like he's...Chandler!
Okay, see that blind guy right there? I'm gonna bash his head in later.
No-no-no-no, he's not! No! Why are you trying to ruin the game? Come on!
He broke up with Julie. Well, go hug her, for god's sakes.
Hey, I may never have kids, and somebody's gotta carry on my family name.
Y'know, I can see why you think that, but ah, actually, you know who I think it is?
Not good, no. I didn't get the part, and I lost my job here, so ...
No dude, you gotta hold your breath until you're ready to answer the question.
Hey-hey! Stanley! Hey-hey! You're leading man is here! Let's get to work.
Oh. Well good! For me. What is this? Did you give yourself a facial?
Well, I started building one. But then I decided to take it to the next step.
And now Chandler! We're all gettin' so old! Why are you doing this to us?!
Uh, Rachel's here, so good luck man, let me know how it works out.
She's probably exhausted from all that adorable screaming she did last night.
Why would I want another apartment, huh? I've already got an apartment that I love.
Yeah! You gotta tell a girl before you tape her. Such a rookie mistake.
So, tell me. Was it like you and Chandler, and then you and me, or you and me and Chandler?
Whoa! Is this porn? What did I do? I must've hit something on the remote.
Two thousand dollars!? What do you think I am? I soap opera star!?
Then I blame you! Yeah! That's right! You threw me off with all your slapping!
Me too! Hey Rach, can I just say I think this is the best date I ever had!
Like this. Pictures of cute babies we don't know. We..we can't have that.
Oh come on man, you can dance with my partner, she's real, uh, mellow!
Oh, man, I could totally get that part. 'I'm sorry, that seat is taken.'
Well, I think it's ridiculous that you haven't had sex in three and a half months.
I'm outta here. Here's my credit card. Dinner's on me. I'm sorry, Chandler.
You know what the Celtics problem is? They let the players run the team.
Yeah, yeah, they must have jumped off the table, 'cause now they're gone!
What you-don't hold it like that! You're lettin' all the good stuff fall out.
Hmm that's weird. I don't remember being in a move called benefits lapsed.
Yeah, yeah. The pay is pretty good and you could do it for as long as you need.
Hey listen, so when's-when's my audition? I mean I know it's Thursday, but what time?
It was different for you guys! I mean, I mean, you were both in the same place, right?
Now you can't tell anyone, but uh...I put on shiny lip balm.
Oh, yeah. He's got that great baby smell. Get a whiff of his head.
Yeah, a naked bagel game? Dude, I don't know. That's a pretty small hole.
Oh, I know it... It is amazing these little things open doors... huh!
Yeah, I gotta go! I got an acting job. Like you'd believe that. This sucks!
He- he- he got in, he- he got in to San Diego.
Yes that's the one about the soldiers who fight in World War I!
He can still catch her! Come on, get out of there! Get out of there!
Hey! You guys! You're not gonna believe this! I just got off the phone with my agent...
I'm an actor, y'know? As-as a group, we tend to be over dramatic.
Whoa, wait, Pheebs, wait a second! Don't you wanna stay here and talk about it?
Oh, man, she loved it! She's over there showing Monica and Rachel right now.
Ross, hey, the band's ready outside for your first dance with Emily, so...
He's kinda tall, dark hair, hand looks exactly like this. See?
Well, you must be new here. Why don't we get a table and I'll buy you a drink.
All right, relax, relax. Just relax, just relax. Be cool, be cool.
Oh! Maybe it's because I'm on television. I'm an actor on Days of Our Lives.
Uhm... oh! Okay. You come with me, and you tell them that the house is haunted!
Uh, am I curious? I mean, I am as curious as... as... George!!
"I just wanna go back to my cell. 'Cause in my cell, I can smoke."
Ooh-ooh, I! I am thankful for this beautiful fall we've been having.
Thanks for everything Estelle. Bye. "out of area". Boy, I'll say.
No! No, I quit a long time ago. Did I forget to you that one? I'm sorry.
Oh, just er... you know, looking around. But you know what? This house... is great.
I just wanna say that I'm sorry I referred to the vein as a seperate person...
You know it's funny you should mention that 'cause I was thinkin'... what's with the boxes?
So what? Being funny is Chandler's thing... You know, like Ross's thing is...
So! Things can go wrong! You don't know! What if he doesn't make it?!
This right here is where I keep the pizza. And uh that's where the napkin is.
Hey! Handcuffs! And fur line, nice! I didn't know you guys had it in ya!
Hey! You guys! Check it out, check it out! Guess which job I got.
Y'know what? Why don't you just give us our souvenirs and get the hell out of here?
Really. Why can't we just get some pizzas and get some beers and have fun?
No it isn't! No, it's not. Because you can also explain it with the truth!
Will you relax?! What are you taking this so seriously for? It doesn't matter.
Or maybe, it's because you're hanging around here at 11:30 on a Wednesday.
Hey! Don't you hang up on me! I'll marry you and me right now! I have the power!
I hate to admit it, but you're probably right. How did you get to be so smart?
Well it's...It's not that crazy okay? Making them smaller, that would be crazy.
I mean naked game. Strip poker, we should totally play strip poker.
So anyway, I'm trying to get my boss's ex-wife to sleep with me. . .
Hey, why can't we use the same toothbrush, but we can use the same soap?
That, is not a cat! {I have to agree with Joey on this one.}
No, no. He said "When are you gonna grow up and start being a mom?"
Half the taste is in the smell! You-you're sucking up all the tastiness!
Okay, well my girl from the other night was special. She was a scientist too!
Man, I got this close to him and Monica kneed me in the back. What's going on?
All right. Let's get the contestants out of their isolation booths. And they're off!
Well, there is one way. His window's open, I say, we poke him.
Hey, this is a little extra somethin' for uh, ya know, always bein' there for me.
When I'm with a woman, I need to know that I'm going out with more people than she is.
Well I tried, but people kept coming in and then you took your breast out!
Okay, but I don't see you asking any other paying customers to put on aprons.
Yeah, I thought so too but, she said the casting people had some problems with me.
Chandler... hey... Rach... what's Hugsy doin' in the crib with Emma?
They go on one date and you're worried about them getting married?! He's not you!
These'll go great in my new place. You know, 'till I get real ones.
Yeah! I was thinking about maybe going upstairs and taking a little nap on my couch.
Tell me about it, huh? Oh no-no-no, I'm not with her, she's just Monica! Ewwuck!
Fine! Have you ever got stuck in a pair of your own leather pants?!
I couldn't help it! When a fist comes at your face, you duck! Look!
Can you stop yellin'? You're makin' me nervous, and I can't go when I'm nervous.
Monica, you have to do some damage control here, okay. 'Cause he's feeling like...
Well, you know that guy that's on my show that's in a coma? He's havin' a brunch.
Phoebs look, if you want to know what the deal is, you're just gonna have to ask him.
Nothing, I'm just practicing blowing you off because I'm gonna be a big movie star!
It's a name, yeah. I saw you, you know, in this great house with a big pool.
You know what? You are my friends, I wanna be supportive, I will come with you. SHOTGUN!
You know, I could like maybe... I could do a dramatic reading of one of her books!
That's it, just hey. Like at the end of a dance, HEY! Hey. He-hey.
Why? Why can't the world stop turning, just for a moment? Just for us?
No, it's not. I mean you-you made me your best man and I totally let you down!
Come on Ross! Look, I-I don't have any brothers; I'll never get to be a best man!
Yeah-yeah. And the craziest thing is that I just ate a whole pizza by myself!
Chandler, I didn't kiss her, he did! See what happens when you break the code?
Yeah, yeah... Absolutely. I mean, just because something's difficult doesn't mean that you quit.
Yeah, like a moth to a flame, I'm telling ya. Okay all right, so now you go.
Alright alright. You're a monkey. You're loose in the city. Where do you go?
Yeah! If you wanna sing at their wedding, well you sing at their wedding!
Excellent! Excellent! And uh, finally, are you into any weird stuff y'know, sexually?
Pheebs! There you are! Okay, you broke my fridge; you owe me 400 bucks!
Probably, yeah... I mean, maybe we should... hold off until we talk to Ross.
Anyway, I started working on what I'm going to say for the ceremony, do you wanna hear it?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! So, I walk in the door and make the right.
To tape the game? You do this every time Ross, you're not gonna be on TV!
Great story! But, I uh, I gotta go, I got a date with Andrea--Angela--Andrea... Oh man,
All right, so we'll get a little coffee, and get energized, and we'll head back out.
You know what's crazy? These jars. What is it, like two bites in here?
Oh, it was a lot of fun right up until Chandler got a finger in the eye!
Oh what, wait, wait a second, I mean, what are we doing? Who's going with who?
Hey! A dog! Hi! Who, you got to admit, looks a lot like Jane.
Ooh, ooh, I know! We should pool all own money and buy the Knicks!
Which helps him get to Phase Three, picturing yourself with other women.
Yeah well, I'm guessing after this she's not going to be crazy about electricity either.
That's great, but isn't it gonna bother that people still think you're a porn star?
I gotta say, I never knew I could enjoy the non-sex part of the date so much.
Don't stop! Move the bowl further away! Ross could make that shot!
Err...Well I...Know how much you used to make and I know how much your rent is.
Wait a minute, did you just make up all that stuff just to get out of being my agent.
Oh, ahh, go to the window. I'm wanna run down to the truck and show you something.
All right that's it! You're yelling and I don't see you taking your top off! I quit!
All right. Chandler, you can either spin the wheel or pick a Google card.
$200? Are you sure Pheebs? I mean, after what Sesame Street did to ya?
Come on! It'll be fun! Me, you, and Ross, and... Paul probably...
Ah, let me see! Damn, that's a lot of guys! Are you a little slutty?
No, no, my mouth says the words, my brain is thinking monster trucks!
Baby shower. Wow! That sounds sooo like something I don't want to do! Later!
If the Homo Sapiens, were in fact 'Homo-sapien', is that why there extinct?
Look, I can sense when women are depressed and vulnerable. It's one of my gifts.
This is so exciting for her. Well, I'll let you two fash...ists get down to business.
I know we're not, but Frank Medeio and... Eva Trorro... womba...
I AM NOT GONNA HELP YOU DO THAT! Goodbye!
I'd say, come again. No-no, wait I-I-I know this one, I know this one, uh...
Uh Ross! Are there uh, are there naked chicks on that piece of paper?
All right, all right, all right, all right, you wanna know what I do when I take resume shots?
You damn right I am, I've been waiting for a cookie for 7 minutes.
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!! None of that, not while you're living under my roof!
And I ate the food, I had the fish, it was good, yeah. It was good, yeah...
Hey, if she were marrying a guy, she'd be like the worst lesbian ever.
Hey and look he brought flowers. Thanks Ross, but I'm really more of a candy guy.
You don't know how long we're gonna be in here! We may have to repopulate the Earth.
Now dad, you'll be in my room, Ronni uh, you can stay in Chandler's room.
Oh, they gave it to me at the sleep clinic, and it's gonna help me not to snore.
Okay, buddy-boy. Here it is. You hide my clothes, I'm wearing everything you own.
Hey! I'm meeting Kathy in ten minutes! I've been looking all over for you!
We've only been going out for a couple of weeks, do you think I gotta get her something?
Set another place for Thanksgiving. My entire family thinks I have VD.
Oh, hi, I'm Joey. My stupid friends are buying this house. Who are you?
Yeah! I stayed at Kate's, but ah, nothing happened. Hey, Pheebs, where were ya?
Chandler, Chandler, y'know what we should do? You and I should go out and get some new sunglasses.
wow, the parade is really good this year. Man those horses can crap.
Relax. You're only at nine centimeters. And the baby's at zero station.
I know, I know..., but that's okay. I mean, we can control ourselves, we're not animals.
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa, I-I-Hey! I did not go out with your wife! Okay? I went out with her!
Okay, okay, fine! Make jokes, I don't care! This is a big break for me!
Well, it's good thing you got out when you did, before she blew up like that Vesuvius.
Good, good yeah, maybe while we're there, they can check your reflexes. "Oops."
Hey! Look, if it didn't work it's because you didn't tell it right! Show me how you did it.
You sure are naming a lot of ways to postpone sex, I'll tell ya...
Yes it is perfectly good, and it is not one of the places the duck got sick!
Don't you put words in people's mouths, you put turkey in people's mouths!
Yeah, you're right. Okay look, listen, let's talk about what a huge star I'm gonna be!
Good, and hey! My treat. But that's only because you're not eating anything, right?
Ah, y'know just in general people being gay, thing. I'm totally cool with that.
No-no, she kicked our butts. You could be on the Olympic standing-there team.
Hey Ross listen Chandler got you out of going to the lesbian sandwich museum this weekend!
Well, maybe that's because you're closer to you. So you look bigger to you from where you are.
Hey guys, so I just called the Powerball hotline, can you believe it? Nobody won.
No, no, no I need a good lie to explain why I wasn't at a work thing today.
I mean come on you guys! My own TV show? I just don't know if I'm good enough.
Yeah, and don't worry. I didn't try to sound smart at all! See ya later!
Well, that-that-that's it? You're gonna, you're gonna put it on your self or anything?
Oh I like this place. And technically, technically I'm not breaking any rules so I...
You're not gonna let me buy the Knicks?? I can't believe you're taking this away from me!
I can't believe it. When you guys come back, you're gonna have a baby! That is so weird!
Because you waited too long to make your move, and now you're in the friend zone.
Okay. Then I guess I have dry eyes and a scratchy throat for no reason.
Oh, nothing, no. It's an acting exercise, I'm practising my fake laugh.
Ross, you should know that my pants are startin' to come down and I'm not wearing any underwear!
I mean if-if you're thinking it's a woman's bag, it's not. It's a man's bag!
I can't decide which route to take to Vegas. Hey, you've traveled a lot right?
Hey, hey, look! It's not about a few fries... it's about what the fries represent.
Shh. He did it. He told her off, and not just about the kiss, about everything.
Oh no! No-no, keep reading! The good part's coming up. Keep going.
Man that was great! Huh? Can you believe how long we threw that ball around?
Don't you see what this means?! I can forget about that stupid movie. I'm gonna be a millionaire!
It's a rented tux. Okay. I'm not gonna go commando in another man's fatigues.
Look, it's not that easy. She said she wanted to marry me. I don't want to hurt her.
Okay, everybody just keep smiling. It'll kill my grandmother if she finds out.
Well sure, you name a kid that, what do you expect them to grow up to be?
Y'know, I'd walk back to London for another frosty one of those bad boys.
Oh really? So, 33 and still single, would you say you have commitment issues?
Ooh, it's probably a residual check, hey can you open it for me, I'm kinda....
Y'know, when we talked about face to face, I don't think we thought it all the way through.
Uh yeah, where-where's the guy who decides who's pictures go up on the wall?
I really am sorry about, you know..before. I just want to make sure you know that I really do like you.
Hey Monica it's Joey. Listen uh, Phoebe and I smell gas comin' from your apartment.
Oh no! How can she do that when she's never shown any interest in you?!?
All right, well maybe I'm enjoying it a little bit. I mean I'm getting pretty good at it.
No, we didn't even pay our cable bill-maybe this is how they punish us.
You do have a choice!! Ross, why are you listening to her?! Are you, are you crazy?!
Oh! Oh-oh, you gotta pick Joey! I mean, name one famous person named Chandler.
He seemed like a stand up guy. Oh, and he's not into anything weird sexually.
Road trip! Yeah, we can rent a car! I just have to be there by Tuesday!
Uh Rach, if you're gonna start another story, at least let me finish mine.
Yeah, I just... I just feel bad about firing Estelle. This is got to be killing her.
Wait a second, wait a second, where have I seen that cowgirl outfit before...
I know! I'm sorry! The guy's drunk, they won't let me go until we get this.
Look, I'll get new headshot taken, all right, so I want to get my eyebrows shaped.
Hey everybody! Uh, I'd like you to meet Janine. She's-she's gonna be my new roommate!
Hey Rach, listen I was thinkin' uh, I'm gonna have an extra room over at my place...
Well that thing is clearing in the way! All right. Ah-ha! Ah-ah!! Damn fridge!
Yeah, yeah. Hey, they totally match! They look great! They look great! How you doing!
Ross! Ross! Ross, listen! Who are you kissing at midnight, huh? Rachel or Phoebe?
Whoa, jam! I love jam! Hey, how come we never have jam at our place?
Wow, I've admired your work for years. You-you've done some really amazing stuff.
