Happy birthday sweetie.

Sure, I'd like that.
So Santa's coming?
So long, Vic!
Neither am I.
Oh, great! Me too.
Bye bye Joey.
But you're not bald.

I think its Tibidabo.
The Waltham Residence.
Hey, you got one right!
Rachel Green's office.
Hi, Mrs. Knight.
How cute was that?
I've never seen it!
Yeah, whatever. Oh no.
You have three nipples?
You've never turned?
Your territory, huh?
Of course I am!
You're gonna kill me!
I really can't slap you.
You're straight. I get it.
Still no smile?
It's all right. Sweetheart.
Oh my God! Bobby!
Oh my God! Whoah!

Five more seconds.
I guess he doesn't know.
Are you Phoebe Buffay?
Just call me Paul.
What's a matter with you?
What are you talking about?
Yeah, I guess that's true.
You don't think I'm cute?
Are you being British?!
What are you? Eight?
That's the whole part?
Well, she has issues.
Breakfast is near!
Very, very bad.
Hey-whoa-hey-hey, what was that?
Rachel? Do you smoke?
I'll take care of it.

Ahh, ahh, excuse me.
Oh. Good to see you guys.
Great. I'll see you later!
I recently had surgery.
It's a diaper genie.
Who in the hell are you?
Phoebe, you don't have to say that.
I intend to marry her.
So, did you talk to Joey?
Tonight. What are you doing?
I'm sorry, what's going on?
Okay. Oh no, I have to.
She broke my arm.
So where did you study?
Is that true miss?
Please, let me do something.
Do you wanna get a drink?
Gavin Mitchelle's office.
Don't, I like it dirty.
You put this in your coffee.
Oh, here they are right here.
No, we are. I'm sad.
Are you wearing my glasses?
C'mon. Let her. Yeah.
Would you like to see them?
I want you to move in with me.
What's too much fun?
Hey you're in our seats.
There's one thing missing.
You blew them away!
Ah, just one other thing.
Are you close with them?
That was a nice pep-talk.
Well, that could take a while.
It's-it's-it's almost dead!
You picked a great couch.
Did you bring the toe?
Whoa! Big octopus.
So, what'd you tell him?
Hey, listen. Call me.
I don't know. Maybe church-camp?
Oh, yeah! Let's do it!
What about my friend Victor?
Yes, Papaya Extract.
We were playing rugby.
You're gonna be a great father.
But you are a real boy!
Joe. How's it going?
That's really a day shoe.
He would like to kiss you.
Why would we be freaked?
No, not getting my bra!
You are an idiot. .
Joey!!! Happy Birthday!!
I think he's stoned again.
You know it's twins, right?
What if you put them here.
It's not that weird, is it?
So, you're a paleontologist, right?
Oh no-no, not at all.
So, this was uh, really fun.
What's wrong with the plane?
Joey Tribbiani, this is...
And your breasts! Hmm!!!
What do you know about love?
Phoebe! That's a great name.
Would you like some gum?
More wine, dear?
Ok... so... Goodbye.
Sorry, prom queen.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Rachel, I made you a cocoa.
Right! But, I am sorry.
Hi, how's it goin?
Yeah. That didn't work out.
Great. That would be fine.
Take 36 is up!
Who? Me the attacker?
Bing! That's a great name.
I don't want you taking that thing.
Well, I don't think this, y'know.
I'm in my boss's car!
I don't think she'd like that.
Hey! You're a good dancer!
You may kiss the bride.
You owe me a waffle.
"Then go, go!"
It can be anything you want.
I lose, now Jenga.
Hey, thanks for talking to me.
Well, if you don't, I will.
So... We go eat.
Actually they were Nana's.
You can come to my house!
No, the man is a mess.
But I don't want this to end.
This almost never happens!
Frank Jr. Jr.!!
Her name's Debra.
No, no, no, no, no!
Oh yeah, let's do that!
Wait! Where's my shoes?
You mean like from behind?
Because we can remember them.
So you want to come inside?
Hi. Is this your first?
My cousin's a paleontologist.
Umm, this is great wine.
So...? What do you think?
Er, yeah, it's mine.
Hey, what are you kidding me?
Sorry...we were just leaving.
I'll never forget you Hans.
Wait! We need shoes!
Well, I'm staying with you guys!
Chicken? Chicken boy!

So umm, are we cool?
Where can I wash up?
Oh, well I thought that ah...

Are you yelling at me?!
Yeah, can I help you with something?
Well, it was nice meeting you.

Okay, you guys free tonight?
You look beautiful this evening.
It was nice meeting you!
My god in heaven.

It went under the table.
What, you don't think I know that?
Incentive For Men?
Really! You-you sail?
Monica! Where are you from?
She took all my stuff.
Her name is Deliah.
Great, I'll see you then.
I see, and Dr. Biely?
You used to be my babysitter.
Well, was there anything else?!
Okay, that doesn't sound good.
You want me to cancel it?
I wish I could talk to her.
Ah, you... have the sex?
My joke wasn't funny.
Okay. Will you marry me?
So, shall we read?
Break up with Charlie!
Ok, you really want me out?
Just be honest with her.
Hey, I forgot my scarf.
Vic! Vic! Vic!!!
Are they, uh, firm?
It's really nice to see you again.
Y'know what, I should do it.
You two know each other?
What's in the cup, Ross?
You okay there, slugger?
Sorry, members only.
Normally, I would not do it.
I'm kind of funny looking.
Let's never speak of this.
Is this your first appology?
We don't need any toner.
Daddy cut me off.
Hi! Rachel Green's office.
Cool! I'll catch up!
Chandler, I'm gonna have you arrested.
They're wildly unpopular.
Uh, no not really. Why?
So, see ya on Saturday.
Are you remaking the bed?
So, can I get some candy?
So when are you getting married?
You did a good thing today.
Is that what you say to Chandler?
Neither of us like Ross!
I thought it went very well.
Hey, where's his thing?
You put this on a hamburger!
You put this on a sandwich.
Rach! Come on! Rach!
I think we've seen enough!
Clever. So how are you?
You've been married twice?
Sorry, everyone is booked!
Really?! That is so cool!
You must be a little uncomfortable.
Well, I'm very glad you're here.
No, my parents are rich.
One ticket to Yemen?
Breathe, breathe, breathe.
Eight! Easy eight.
Okay. I didn't know he was here.
Well, I'm not gonna talk because...
I-I-I'm leaving the show?
I'm sorry, I never had 'em.
Not so fast Wesley!
And you fixed the Philange?
I had them made special.
Hi Mom, it's Jill.
I came to give you this and this.
Why'd you freak out?
When is Santa coming?
Oh my God. I think you're right.
He... he's gonna propose?
Seriously, you're an intern?
Oh uh, up or down?
Almost time for cake.
No, she's hanging in there.
Is there a Julio here?
But there was no flash.
So how did everything go?
Ross? What's with the neck?
Hi! What-what're you doing here?
Then don't break in!!
I know. That's what I told her.
Oh! You know what I need?
Nobody. I was just practicing.
Hi, is uh Phoebe here?
Rachel! Could I have a moment?
Uhh, not that I know of.
All right. This is the kitchen.
Any painful gas?
We agreed on Minnie.
It's open! Come in!
I would love to go out with you.
That'd be great, thanks.
It's not that kind of anniversary.
No, I just thought it was cute.
We learned how to dance.
Very nice. Very nice.
Oh, sure. Sure, absolutely.
You got two more twos?
Chandler, what-what are you doing?
Well, what was supposed to happen?
We're uh, we're getting married.
Come on over here, sweetheart.
Do we have a name yet?
So! How's the library?
what's up is Phoebe ok?
Your pants are undone!
Alrighty. From the top.
Yeah? Well you look phenomenal.
But they're not here yet!
Looks good. I'll take it.
Yes, yes, do go on.
C'mon kid, let's go.
Making out in your office.
So glad you brought someone.

He touched my fanny.
Thank you! Good meeting you.
Oh my God, you're the sister!
A match, a candle...
Oh my God! I'm your groupie!
I want you right here, right now.
Oh, who's this little guy?!
That must have been hard.
What do you mean, your seat?
Okay Rachel, are you comfortable?
So we can go out again?
Just the last two pages.
Yeah, but I didn't get to see it.
Then uh, what's-what's this?
What does he look like?
Oh that was a real person?!
C'mon hurry, hurry.
One, two, three...
Would you like to call somebody?
We've come for her things.
Ok, just one more point.
You have three new messages.
Oh right, uhm, Don?
Hi. I'm Rob Dohnen.
I'm looking for Phoebe Buffay!
Put your balloons down!
And you're still married to him?
She's not making me uncomfortable.
Yeah, let's go. Thanks Ross.
Then, can I have your number?
Ah yeah, sorry about that.
You're right. It was 37.
Nothing! It's an expression.
Is that supposed to be funny?
Ten bucks a game?
No. No, you're not a loser.
Hey hey, come on in!
So, is it my turn now?
What are you doing here, Geller?
So you lied to me before?
Yeah! This feels really good.
Uhm... Ha ha!
Uh, it's the college playoffs.
This could've been hers!
Worth a shot, huh?
Cut! Very nice people!
Which is bad, because?
Oh, thanks! That's so sweet!
You told him he's adopted?
Yeah. Are we nuts here?
So it's just your mother then.
So uh, who's your photographer?
Howard's the handy man!
Why don't you try to do-
I decorated Dad's office.
Hey, what do you want to drink?
So, who's the lucky guy?
Ah actually, that is mine.
There isn't a piano here.
So you're not friends with him?
So, so, did you hear?
Well, it's nice to know that you...
Oh, just updating the phonebook.
Monana was very brave.
What in the name of hell?
I just, I thought Joey was there.
Good luck, with your girlfriend.
That's about 60 cents.
No, I told you...get out!
I understand that would be difficult.
No, you can't use your watch.
Wow, this place looks great.
Through the glass doors.
Oh, well, I'll show you around.
Dr. Wells is a woman.
Ohh, it's a bit small.
Chandler, what are you talking about?
All right, let's try one.
Rossy, we're ready for you.
By being in a box?
All right, see ya Pheebs.
Oooh it's getting close!

Nobody sees the king!
Monica, wake up. Monica.
No you do. You... just...
What do you need help for?
I guess we just keep dancing.
Why don't I remember this dog?
Rachel didn't you just light that?
We can go into detail...
You're an excellent patient!
How do you think I should propose?
Well, thanks again for lunch.
Umm, I thought about you all day.
Oh that'd be great. Sure!
Is everything all right, dear?
No, it really should be burgundy.
It's Allesandro, from Allesandro's.
Just get out of here, okay?
Madame, your passport please?
I think I know what's going on here.
Ohhh! Put it out!
And some biscottie cookies.
Hey Joey. Hi. Hey, buddy.
It does sound appealing.

It's an unpaid internship.
Here's your warm milk.
Oh, boy, do they suck.

Okay. It was nice to see you.
A film in Guadalajara!
Yes and you talked to her...

Oh I...I think they're funny.
Oh thanks! I like your top.
Thank you, Max. Thank you.
Thanks for dinner last night.
Yeah, sure, that'd be great.
Um, thank you for the gift.
I have a question about this scene.
I'm not allowed to have soda.
All right, let's move on.
I just sold it to that gentleman.
"Hey Chandler, it's Charlie"
Excuse me, you think I'm cheap?
Oh, good. Thisll be fun.
I suppose mainly sexual.
Joey, this is awkward part.
You're our third call tonight.
No, no, no. What was that?
Do you have a hair straightener?
Ohh! Didn't know! Okay!
Oh then you know each other.
Ah-ah-ah, you know what that is?

Oh, so sorry man! Sorry!
Well, what do you want me to say?

Hey! Oh God, is that Baywatch?
You told me I was the only one.
Your eyes are very pretty.

Well, you certainly own that room.
That's funny. Who are they?
A doctor at this hospital?
Hey guys, how is it going?
Then you gotta let them go.
Are you interested in this ring?!
Oh, actually I sorta have plans.

Hi. Okay, will that be all?
Oh, hey look nothing happened.
Sorry, I don't know any Earl.
He's getting married tomorrow right?
I am not telling you guys anything.
Oh, is he hungry already?
So, why did you break up?
Oh God, Ross I am so sorry.
No more so than acting.
Do you know who at my office?
I know! It's awful. I love you.
How do you fix the chair?
Ohhh, you're having a parteee.
Do you two know each other?
Well, thank you for giving it back.
I lost it. To drugs.
We'll do a quick check.
I just remembered, I have to do something.
I'm sorry, is the seat uncomfortable?
Yes, that's Raspberry coule.
Okay, I'll see you in an hour.
You don't think this is too fast.
I missed you. I'm gonna get changed.
So, Monica, how's the ankle?
Dr. Burke will see you know.
How you doin there squirmy?
I could be Chandler's new roommate.
I know a guy who's the 18th.
It's ok. Ho-honest mistake.
Hope you had a nice flight.
Oh my God, you are so paranoid!
Just aim for the bump.
You can do this. Just breathe.
Someone I can spoil, y'know?
Try. There's my little girl.
Well that's wonderful. . . I
I know! I'm Erin Brockovich!
Yeah, for you. Is that the list?
I'd love some juice. Thanks.
Oh my God! That was flirting?!
Wanna make it more interesting?
So I guess Rachel had you baby?
Hi, thanks for coming in again.
He went out with my wife!
More of Grandma's teramisu.
Help me! This hurts!
You must be Ben's mum.
Absolutely. I love the way you kiss.
Well, you got uhm... good energy.
Um, would you like to come in?
Hey Chandler, what are you doing here?
But you tell it really well, sweetie.
Trust me, I will never...
Anyway, it was lovely seeing you.
I was going to call him, but...
Okay lady, you're out of here.
Sure, he was in your "band"?
You must be Rachel, I'm Erin.
Mommy, I can't find Waldo.
I'm looking for Eddie Minowick.
Good for you. Alrighty, next?
Look, I'll just give you this and go.
Sorry I'm late, what's up?
Ooh, steer clear of you.
Well, I can't take this plane now.
Do you want me to check again?
Wow! You are really good at this.
I'll call you later. Bye Ross.
Yes, it is. Carol! Hi!
Oh Alessandro's! I love that place!
Oh my God, I love your shirt!
So, who's the mystery man?
I won! That was my quarter!
No. Sweetie, you're gonna be fine.
What do you need from the car?
Uh, that's our friend Tanya.
Yeah, well, now you're kinda not.
You need both hands for that?
According to recent findings!
What?! What would make you think that?
You mean like exclusive friends?
No, you stay, I'll do it .
That-that's him! You know him?
Well, hats off to the chef.
Err... we know what we want.
Don't you want to know about the sex?
Hey Toby, you got a sec?
As much as he needs.
How's it gonna be all right?!
So uh, you wanna go to Marquel's?
Couldn't it just be a coincidence?
Thanks for going along with this.
And could I get my ring back?
Oh, all right, fine, fine, fine.
He can have his job back.
This couch belongs to us.
Hey, that kid looks familiar.
You know, I can't tell it again...
Wait! You forgot your legs!
No, I was talking about your bedding.
So? Huh? What do you think?
No, I ahh, had another idea.
...Like, ...all of them?
No, no, I don't want to forget it.
Yeah, I'm really looking forward to it.
It's about your monkey. It's alive.
And I do have one seat left.
Hey! What the hell are you doing?!
How, how is this my fault?
More turkey Mr. Chandler?
Yeah! That's right. Yeah-yeah! Yeah!
Aren't you going to swallow that?
Ma'am, please sit down!
I have a question I need to ask you.
You might wanna get back in there.
They-they-they can smell fear.
Hi sweetie! Are you leaving?
Ah, which ever is closest.
All right, you have yourself a deal.
I've got no reason to stay.
I think I wanna get married to you today.
They all had a thing for him.
Well, somebody got some last night.
Phoebe's got another job, right?
Oh my God! Ray-ray Green?!
Doctors are wrong all the time.
You're right. Of course you're right.
That saves us a conversation.
Oh, I used to work with Frannie.
Is that an expensive blouse?
Rachel, please, don't make a scene.
I think I know who you're talking about.
Hi Dina. Good to see you.
'Cause you guys were on a break.
That's why you broke up with me?
Hi, I'm Precious, who are you?
Hi! I brought you back a macaroon!
Now get on out of here, you!
Oh, I'm not falling for that one!
You, get out of my shop!
Oh, like, uh, five minutes?
Hey! So what show are you on?
Oh! I like that. What's your name?
Are they still looking for us?
I came to talk to you about Howard.
We're gonna give it another try.
Who drank all the Kamikazes?
I'm sorry, I don't own a TV.
No-no that's a man's shirt.
Somebody called about a monkey?
No, you didn't. Hi, I'm Kathy.
Oh my God! It's like a fairyland.
Oh, please, we're happy to help.
What, wait, you mean like this?
It got caught on my watch.
That's my wife!!! Get out!
No Santa? Was I bad?
It doesn't happen to me either.
Well, we had a table in college.
I want to talk to you about your review.
Ahh, miss? More coffee?
Are you travelling with a child?
You can say that again Mac.
Rudolph, the red-nosed reindeer...
Oh, you don't have to do that every time.
It's a good play, isn't it?
I don't care! You just get him!
Ah, oh, the ah, vandalism.
I've had a really good time tonight.
Who in God's name are you?
18th and East End.
Well, I'm still sorry. Is he here?
No, I'm... not going to Minsk.
But, you're not identical twins.
Thank you. I'm from New York.
Would you.......Would you hug me?
May I see your boarding pass?
You're doing great, you're doing fine.
She told me she was 25.
Come on. I'll let you lead.
Did anybody call for security?
Oh boy, I just love to sing!
Become a drama critic!
Uhh, you said there was a party.
I think I lost. Three times.
Hey, Rach! How ya doin'?
You can't leave a baby alone!
So uh, do you live around here?
No, I really did forget my purse.
So, how's everything going in here?
A guy who won two.
I'd love an ice water.
Well, I don't know. Are you a masseur?
What's the matter? Are you upset?
Oh great! Wow! Yeah, it's comfortable.
Well all right, one thing happened?
You are playing American football?
Okay, hope I see you tomorrow night.
Just give me a chance too...
You really enjoyed yourself didn't you?
Your messages have been erased.
Hey Joey, you wanted to talk to me?
Ow! Did you just bite me?
Oh look at you! So handsome!
All right. It's no big deal.
So. I guess I'll see you around.
Scene 5, take 1.
I'll check the kitchen floors.
Are all the questions this personal?
Why won't you take our picture?
Are you one of Ben's mothers?
Can I get you a cup of coffee?
And wait, I've got something for you.
Honey, don't bite your nails.
All right, you two, stop it!
Actually yeah, that'll be great.
The baby's head is crowning.
Hey! How did everybody sleep?
Well that's not a third nipple.
No. This is my red sweater.
Oh, yeah. Had that dream.
You guys tell them you were married?
Wow! They're both really strong.
Okay! Thank you! That was great!
Hey, Chandler! What are you doing here?
I won't quit until you try.
Oh, you know what? I'll come with you!
No, I was working on my pottery.
No!! Cover it up!!
Honey, honey, people are looking.
Oh that's great! You are the best!
That's not what we talked about!!
What? Do you think he likes me?
I'm gonna go talk to uh, a friend.
No, just a salad will be fine.
Excuse me, I'm standing right here!
Oh, by the way... I'm awesome!!
Can I ask what-Come on in.
Any time you're ready, Joey.
Checking to see if it's even.
Excuse me, that's 50 bucks.
So ah, what's wrong with him?
Yeah, I just gotta run to the bathroom.
Ahh, look at you, you look great.
You're married more than once?
So? I mean have you thought about it?
You had sex with her didn't you?
Give me a 'for instance'.
I feel good! ...Who are you?
I thought you knew I was looking at you.
Really? Then why are you like that?
Well, at least I'm not a murderer!
Are you going to eat that bread?
Ross, can I talk to you for a minute?
Rachel, you needed to speak to me?
We kinda broke up this morning.
I'm not saying you have to be Barney.
There's nothing wrong with the plane.
That's sweet. Could I take her?
I'm sorry guys, closed set.
Miss? Are you boarding the plane?
Don't point your finger at me.
Actually I ah, I am a poet.
It's never gonna happen again right?
Aaaah, what's wrong, c'mon.
Yeah alright, that sounds alright.
"You have two new messages."
Oh, hi. I'm professor Wealer.
Oh wow! I'm free for her!
N-No running in the chapel!
'We' would be me and Rick.
I'm sure you have better things to do.
Hey, where are we going to lunch?
Do you know where the store is?
Yeah, it's a fine line huh?
I'm gonna leave the three of you alone.
You guys live around here too?
Oh hi. It's, it's Mark.
Well? Aren't you gonna do something?
Ah here, we brought wine.
Your '74 Lafite sir.
Oh, where'm I gonna stay, here?
Oh my God, I think I'm gonna cry!
So uh, Monica is Ross's sister.
...the scotch and the cigarettes...
Drops. Here, they're free.
No, it's too soon for you guys.
Rachel... I heard you guys whispering.
That's where you pick up the bag.
Ew, this feels very weird.
Bing! Ho! And the Bing-ette!
Would you like my tin-foil hat?
That's very good, what's your name?
Do-do you, do you have brothers?
No, let me explain! Fired!!
Care to venture a guess?
Didn't I just throw you out of here?
The one in the director's chair.
Have a seat son. Hey!!
What'd you think I was, a hooker?
Oh, well I tell Issac everything.
So, uh, is this, uh, mistletoe?
You're saying, my wife is in you?
Thank you! Enjoy your flight?
Alright, let me just get my coat.
You don't secretly smoke do you?
Uh-huh! Let me ask you something?
Well, whatever works for ya...
Oh my God, I can't believe you're here!
And your also bad in bedd-edd-edd!.
Joey, Joey! We're ready for you!
I know, but it's my job, sweethart!
Well, you'll have to wait your turn.
Oh, you are the, uh... paleontologist.
Ah, good to meet you. Robert.
All right. Here's your first baby.
A joke they would appreciate?
Maybe because you've got the keys?
No! No! I wanna see you take-off.
Well, you're Pennsylvania Dutch, right?
Elizabeth, what are you doing here?!
I gotta tell you, you look great now.
It's uh, it's already been roasted.
Drake, what're you getting at?
Aren't you gonna give me a kiss?
Well, if you want, you can work here.
Hello Rachel, you uh, got a minute?
Yeah, you can't eat that in my car.
Scene 5, take 2.
I've uh, I've come to talk to Ross.
Incidentally, when are you coming back?
You are so dead! I'm gonna get you.
Well... hey, the key works...!
A part of him did yes.
You tell her Jack, I can't do it.
Yeah, they wanna see you again tomorrow.
We appear to have angered it.
Then, you're redoing it because...
This is really hard for me to say.
You hired your husband a hooker?
Can't we just ask her to go?
We can have any future you want.
It's so nice to finally meet you!
...and the bansai's and the chiuaua...
Well uh, do either of you smoke?
I like her. She sees smart.
Okay, that's-that's not funny. Uhh.
You need to get out of my chambers.
I don't know. Let me see the ring.
Yeah, I love you. Okay, bye! Hi!
Morning's here! The morning's here!
God, you're gonna be here all night!
Hey Pheebs! How's it going?!
So. How'd you guys meet?
Hey pal, are you Joey Tribbiani?
Hey Duck, is Chick here?
I would have told him to do it too.
Look at this! There we go!
Of course! It's her favorite.
Sweetie, you think you can get in there?
Oh, I wouldn't miss it for the world.
Phoebe, can I talk to you for a second?
Oh my God! Did you talk to him?
Well I was just so excited to see you.
I think you should give him your star.
I haven't slept in four years!
Okay, I love you. Is that so bad?
1 minute 50 seconds.
We want you to speak to a psychiatrist.
Umm, actually, I'm getting married again.
Shh! No! Joe Hill!
Lights. Uh, romantic lights.
Y'know, all I'm looking for is the money.
Twenty-one hours, you're a hero.
When I was six years old.
Excuse yourself, and go to the bathroom.
She's not much of a phone person.
You're a strange kind of grown-up.
Oh. Okay! How can I help you?
Congratulations. I'll give you two a minute.
You're not wearing the patch yet.
Naah... I couldn't leave you alone.
So, have you kids eaten yet?
Umm, I'll have a cup of coffee.
Yes. They're insanely white.
Really! You got a place upstate?
And who may I say is calling?
Really? Because I think about you all the time.
Here's a copy of your bill.
So, the Etch-a-Sketch is from you guys?
*Now* it feels like Christmas.
Umm, do you sell these bags?
Can I get you something from the bar?
Oh, I was going to offer you my apartment.
Why aren't you moving your feet?
When's my daddy coming back?
Yeah, so she went back to Ohio.
Loved him! Yeah! He's great!
You wanted to see me Professor Geller?
Actually, I just gave up my practice.
We're gonna be roomies! Come on!
I'm sorry things didn't work out...
Mom, dad, thanks for dinner.
And first, I have to see the MET!
Ah Monica, my star student.
Y'know, they ruin it for everybody.
So I understand you're looking for a place.
Well kinda old, like 30.
I hear you can get people out of here.
Are you just repeating what I'm saying?
Here's a little something to get you started.
Well there's one and there's another .
I can promise not to tell her again.
Thank you guys for having us over.
Hey, how, how did you do that?
Uh-oh, I feel another one coming.
Nope! That never happened to me!
And that's not all I'm allergic to.
Good, because it's in ten minutes.
Um, yeah, um, twin thing.
Is it true they have beer?
I feel great. In fact! What?
Aunt Phoebe, what are you doing here?
Yeah, um, I'm, I'm leaving now.
Hey Toby! Have a good night.
Okay, she was here, but she left.
Keep singing! Keep singing!
So, are you experiencing any discomfort?
And my cholesterol's off the charts!
So how did you know I was even here?
Oh my God, that was for my benefit?
Yeah. We have rat babies now.
Hi! I-i-is this a bad time?
God, your hair sure is different!
We could write it down for you?
Ross? That opens my cervix.
I'm gonna take her back to the appartment.
So you like the short hair better.
Sure, I'll go check on Emma.
I'm sorry. He'll be waiting for me.
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Awww!
So umm, I'll see you tomorrow, huh?
You didn't marry your Barry. I did.
No come on. Come on tell me.
She's not here and please come in.
Aren't you with that girl over there?
Come on along and listen to...
Is Tony Randall dead?
But, he told me over the phone.
I remember when we first got engaged.
Am I allowed to drink anything?
Why would he break up with me?
So it's-it's not heeled yet?
Fine! Two minutes. Go.
No-no-no, the-the puppy's yours.
Please, come in. Have a seat.
But, you left the chair area.
Your lipstick's on his mouth.
Actually, I'm here about the assistant job.
Yeah, it is! Naked Ross!!
I'm uh, considering leaving your father.
Good, good, I'm a lawyer now.
Weird Girl, what are you doing?
You still don't know my name, do you?
Oh hi kids. Hi darling.
I don't know, they're just a little blah!
The one I told you about last week?
No, that's not exactly what I was..
Okay, okay, from the top. And...Action!
Do you not want to be seen with me?
Monica, you go to the head of the class.
Hey, what kind of work do you do?
Not your type?! She's gorgeous!
You don't clean the cappuccino machine?
Aw, you're right, you're right. I'm sorry.
My God, what were you thinking about?
Is this about me taking your watch?
Hi, is Rachel here? I'm her sister.
I'm probably gonna need those. Huh?
I just came for the red-velvet pillow.
I think you may have a drinking problem.
Oh, thank you Chandler! I just bought it.
Ahh that's the 2 points.
Hi Ross! You ready for breakfast?
I don't know, I mean I'm not sure ...
Glad to be of help. Matches.
Sure, sure. What's with the chair.
Hey, do you need me to pick you up?
What's Ross doing to you on that picture?
I love Mark. Do you know Mark?
I didn't think you were gay. I do now.
No you answer it and take pledges.
I think it makes you look really dangerous.
Well, I'm back from Minsk... permanently.
I think it's great you guys are doing this.
Yeah! Yeah, sort of. I'm sorry.
Ah well, I-I'm seeing someone.
Uh, I am, uh, being naked?
You don't think we should wait for him?
So, thank you for the delicious dinner.
Darling, that's a breast pump!
Why don't we take it for a spin?
Could you press up too please?
I'm sorry, is there something going on here?
Nobody! We put them in here!
Ross, whose glasses are those?
Hey umm, you brought protection right?
No no no. Talk... dirty.
How did you know there was a but?
Okay, I can let it go at eight.
Well, we did a little more than that.
So how do you kids like your coffee?
Oh hello Ross, where have you been?
So hum...Why did I have to hide?
Thanks for having me over, you guys.
I'm sure he was just joking, Ross.
Here's your call sheet for tomorrow.
Hey, mind if I use the phone?
I'm sorry. Was I not supposed to?
Yeah, well, he is a brilliant man.
So you know what I'm talking about, right?
How, how can you be here and there.
You have a Miss Monica Geller here.
Come in, I'm so glad you're here.
Good, good, life is good...
Oh my goodness! You haven't heard!
So, what did Francis leave me?
But you're supposed to work on Monday.
Alright, then I'm gonna change my name.
No, she's at a faculty meeting.
Hey... Wh... What are you doing?
Yeah! As long as we're here!
Wait-wait! You're umm, you're a potato...
Thanks. You wanna hear something funny?
Ross, they are killing you out there!
Thank you! So, can I stay with you?
What?! I've never seen one before!
How's that coffee comin,' dear?
Hi! And this is my wife Kara.
You found that handle, did ya?
Oh yes of course, hello Chandler.
So, eight days late huh?
Oh hey! Good, you're both here.
Er, uh, I'm just gonna go. Sorry.
This is from the woman at the bar.
It's uh, 27 dollars even.
No, where did you study acting?
You're right. We'll go with the burgundy.
Oh great! Oh, you. Umm, what's up?
No dear, that's what babies do.
Oh honey, I think I'm having one too!
Hold on! You got her pregnant?
So, I think you're boxes are over here.
Wow! That's ah, that's pretty nice!
Okay, I know that I went to that all ready.
Uh, I am, uh, to say good-bye.
Ross, drugs? Divorced? Again?
It's Eddie you freak, your roommate.
You need to fill out this form.
I thought you wanted to adopt your cat.
O-kay. Look, it, it was stupid.
I just realized why I remember this place.
Our little boy is getting married.
No, she touched mine first!
Mommy, what's wrong with that man?
No, I'm getting it. I'll be right back.
Yeah, Joey and Chandler sure are funny.
So what are you guys out doing today?
Oh my God, that's just like my name!
Maybe. Does that scare ya?
I'll even let you ring the bell.
Why? Are we done for the day?
I thought it was... quite tasty.
Good luck! Go get 'em!
Guess what, I got an audition!
I mean, there's a statue in Minsk...
Oh cool! You made him cry!
Well, call me if you change your mind.
What did Joey say? I like you back?
Ah well, this is the living room.
Yeah, me too. So, I guess this is it.
Shoot! I can't go, I have to work!
Do you have any question for Erica?
Clearly, I'm having sex with him?
What do you see? What do you see?
Oh! That feels sooo good!
Oh, I must've said that after you left.
Well, you kids take the train in?
Hey it's Mona! From the wedding.
Night Mon. Night Julio.
Six? You want me to join you?
You-you have a very beautiful... eye.
We stopped at the gift shop.
Yeah, what's up with that girl Monica?
Hey, so are you sure your ready to go.
You guys have such a great place here.
You go get that animal outta here.
I didn't ask. You wanna come in?
Oh, I'm gonna kick Chip's ass.
So uh, here's your office set!
Okay, I'll see you at the station later.
Smelly cat, smel-ly cat...
Huh. What's Tag's last name?
It did at first, but not anymore.
No, but it did! Didn't it?!
Ross is coming. Great! I love Ross!
So you guys want me to take this back?
Okay, let's try this one more time.
Oh, no no no. I'm fine. I'm fine.
That was great, the kids loved you.
I dunno, uh... you just have a-a...
No. And I don't think I'm gonna want to.
Yeah, yeah. Hey, thanks for doing that.
Also a good gift? Underwear.
And also, congratulations on your wedding.
Hey, anybody want to meet a hero?
This is impossible. Its just impossible.
You're disturbing my oboe practice.
Why don't we do a trial run.
SOMEBODY ORDER A PIZZA?
You! Chuckles! What's your name?
I thought you thought he was still a lawyer.
Ok, listen, thanks for coming in.
Dr. Geller, will you dance with me?
Oh, here is your beautiful baby. Congratulations!
Did I, uh, did I miss something?
Oh, look who's here, it's the weenies.
What's taking you boys so long?
Ah, Susan will be so pleased.
I'm going to look into your eyes now.
You're into hardcore S&M right?
I should just be happy to be near you.
I'm sorry, I, I just need a little time.
Some guys are just lucky I guess.
No, no, I'm still working on mine.
I'm just going to need to see your passport.
I think I saw Rachel out in the hall.
You're not gonna speed anymore right?
Okay. Have you started having contractions?
So far, I've sold seventy-five.
There's one leaving in thirty minutes.
I see. Have you considered therapy?
Why aren't you at home in bed?
I uh, don't really have a preference. You?
Comin' through. Move, move.
Look at her, my first grandchild.
You're so sweet! And I'm so surprised!
So, uh, what are you going to do next?
Thank you Richard, I appreciate the support.
Do you mind if I smoke in here?
Okay, all right. Let's do it. And...Action!
Oh, I'm sorry. I'll take this. Excuse me.
Oh yeah! Come on! Yeah right!
Don't be. It's just bad timing.
no it's not ringing any bells.
Hey Joey, I got some beer for you.
Jack used to handle the finances!
I must tell you, you look beautiful tonight.
Even if he were... cornered?
No, let's just leave the lights on.
I didn't realize that she was so close.
Y'know what? We need to move on.
One more chance Ursula, please?
I was gonna have Thanksgiving at my girlfriend's.
Bing! You got those numbers for me?
I studied for a year in Barcelona.
Hi David. Chandler. Monica... Oh!
I'm sorry you had to do this by yourself.
So what. I say, punch him.
Okay, last chance. Again, I'm sorry.
Yeah, we're not thirty, we're 31.
Really? You don't know what that means to me.
She's out, I'm gonna take her home.
How are we gonna get out of that one?
You don't need to fill these silences.
Ross, you didn't tell me you were a doctor!
No, she'll yell at me again.
First of all, it's on your ass.
Yeah uh...okay. I'm-I'm sorry. Bye.
Uh, there's a drunk Chinese guy.
You'd think, wouldn't you? Miss?
Oh, way, way better than Mindy.
What? Are you married? 'Cause that's okay.
I thought you came to say you were sick.
Oh, thank you Phoebs. That's very sweet.
You must've had your hands full.
No no no! Federal regulations!
All right you two, I'm gonna get going.
You know, I don't know what I'm looking for.
Sorry, there's just more room out here.
Oh, I, uh- I went to Aruba.
That's right. But if you don't want to know...
Uhm... Did you just hit my dad?
I'm gonna go check up on your friend.
I'm a party planner. I'll see you tomorrow.
I am so attracted to him right now.
YESSSSS!!!!! We got a baby boy!!
Just-just to clarify, I'm not Fonzie.
Twins actually run in my family.
He's a keeper. How are you feeling?
That's just halftime, there's more of this.
And now you'll see me buying it.
Mississippi? I said count to five'!
My kid's in a play right now.
Yeah, I just made it up. Spell it.
Look, I just wanted to have coffee with Rachel.
Thank you. Is that one of my cigarettes?
What, is he your pet rat?
Oh, please! What's wrong with Helen?
Yes, I feel that you are a little annoying.
Right... Oh, I got something for you, too.
Why? Why?! What's wrong with me?!
Right, why do you keep saying that?
No, I'm getting three separate heartbeats.
Would you like to see a semi-private room?
You're right, you're right! I'm gonna do it!
You bet. Maybe some other time?
Wait a minute! Take your pants.
Yeah...we kinda didn't use any...
Oh! What about, what about the girls?
Forget it Joey. I'm with Bob now.
Absolutely. You can relax; you did great.
Actually about an hour and a half.
They prefer it if I don't barter.
So, are we gonna get together or what?
Nina Bookbinder is here to see you.
Buon Giorno, Bella Phoebe!
Hey, it's the dinosaur guy. Hi, Ross.
Well, you are not doing a very good job!
Only if you'll be Phoebe Buffay.
You do now. You're having dinner with me.
Oh my God, who died on this?!
You lost 13 million dollars.
Joanna passed away last night.
Hey. What are we drinkin' over here.
Guys. Seriously, it is not like that.
Well, ok then. I'm gonna go. Bye.
I can't believe Emma is already one!
Stupid Jack, the word is stupid.
Okay. Okay, here's a good one of us.
Tonight, but don't say anything. Okay?
I think you should talk to Ross about all this.
It does. It feels really good!
It's so... something... You go girlfriend!
What can I say? She nailed it.
You're jealous because I'm a real doctor.
Y-, y-, you like that show?
WE WON!! Thank you! Yes!
Well all right. I'll see you at four.
Ohh! And I love spending time with you.
Don't go anywhere, I'll be right back.
I don't know? Do I? Do I?
I am gonna try and quit drinking.
So, how did your audition go today?
Oh. - What's *that* like?
Wow, uh, anything else I should know?
We've got a cab waiting downstairs.
Will you be my maid of honour?
Honey, we don't have any bears here.
No nonsense! We're all in this together.
Oh! Um... Well... I'm getting married.
Would ya care to venture one?
The doctor will be right with you sir.
I'm Rhonda, and these aren't real!
Hi Joey, what's goin' on man?
Oooh, that sounded like a bad one.
Oh, yes Elizabeth. Ah, 871.
There's a side of steamed vegetables.
Why? So you could hang up on me?
I took your advice, I left Myron.
Yeah, I filled them out last night?
Excuse me, sir, where are you going?
And then we've gotta get some sleep.
Uh, well... Joey and I broke up.
No! It don't go up on the wall!
Jack, that's what they call the subway.
I don't like you going out with my daughter Ross.
The dark of night has disappeared!!
Well, I just wanted to make sure you were okay.
No, I have some turning 21 to do.
Let it be me! Let it be me!
I assume we're talking about the baby now.
So, are you a member of any gym.
Don't worry about it. It's not a problem.
Wow! You look like... like my mom.
It could've been a hair straightener.
Yeah, I'm riding the alimony pony.
Oh, oh, I thought we were just talking.
Actually, I'm not here to complement the chef.
Thanks so much for showing me around.
Do I have a minute to go to the bathroom?
Well, it was great seeing you the other night.
Joe, mom and dad are fine...
Hey, it's so nice to finally meet you!
Well, anyway, I hope we can be friends.
Yeah, y'know the license plate game?
Yeah? Well you still shoulda told me.
Why do you keep looking at the screen?
Hello? It's not gonna be Helen Geller.
You don't have to go home tonight, do you?
Ross play rugby? I don't think so.
How hard could it be? You do it.
Hello, Monica. Hello, greeter girl.
Judy, going to the bathroom, good for you.
I'd love to ask out your friend Phoebe.
Gavin, Ralph loved your ideas.
Oh, that does sound. . .Ahh.
No-no really, was-was that not okay?
You really don't seem like you do. That's...
Mom, I'll call you later. Yeah. Yes?
Vic! Where have you been, baby?!
Hey, I got a 690 on my SATs.
Rust, is boat cancer, Ross.
OK Phoebe, you ready to try one?
Yeah, that-that Chandler cracks me up.
So, tell me a little bit about yourself.
Christie Turlington, Kate Moss...
Pecan sandy, just made em.
Saw your head. Saw your head.
Rachel, do you have any muffins left?
Well, I think this is a great place to work!
Oh! Well, you know what? It probably is.
Youre kidding? She seems so...
Oh yeah? How'd yours happen?
Oh I think it's best that I speak first.
Miss, I can't let you off the plane.
Did you cut this couch in half?
I'm close. I'm cheap. I'm the king.
You by the door. In or out?
I'll stay if you can tell me my name.
No but he didn't really talk about anything.
Well, her memory is pretty much gone.
Yeah, any messages for room 226?
Well, then it's not on the wall yet.
Would you like to move over to the couch?
Still rolling, annnnd action!
All right. Keep pushing! Come on!
Yeah, not really. Babies are dull.
You ready to go to the batting cage?
Okay, I guess you can...close the door now.
What?! They wanted a scary story!
Oh, sweety, you can't pull this off.
Looks like that might come any minute.
Oh, I know, I know. I've just been crazed.
I'll just wait to put your order in.
Which one? Which button, Jack.
Ya know, she's having another baby.
I'll take "You crossed the line".
All right, he's coming. He's coming!
Oh, figuring out our wedding plans.
This is so nice. Thank you for doing this.
Are you a, uh, friend of Rachel's?
Um, maybe 15, 16 years.
We must go now, quickly, please.
Of course. I'll always be your dad.
Uh, Phoebe you-you don't have an office.
Oh, a 16-hour sit-in for Greenpeace.
All right, honey, time to start pushing.
Oh, I know a guy in homicide up there.
Maybe we didn't make it clear enough.
Y'know it's that feeling you get, y'know?
No, it was. It was very very good.
Yeah, thank you Rachel, you are soo cool.
Y'know uh, actually I-I-I should get going.
I'll go check your file. Excuse me.
Can I get you another glass of wine?
I was just being polite, but, alright.
Oh well, no harm, no foul.
Ah, excuse me, are you Rachel Green?
Hey, no way, I'm in the shot man.
I really appreciate you taking the time to do this.
Well, I guess this is uh, I guess this is it.
Hey, my favorite part is coming up!
Oh, OK, yeah. I'll see ya later.
You obviously can't keep away from her.
And I'll fit you for a glass eye.
He better go on for what I'm paying.
Are you guys going to Chandler's for Thanksgiving?
I um, was sorta thinking about maybe...
Why don't you look in the mirror, scrud.
Oh we blew it. I blame myself.
Have you felt Rachel's cervix Ross?
Now Ross, repeat after me. I Ross...
I almost forget the tickets, didn't I?
Is it ok if I hug you now?
Your thinking about my leg aren't you?
No, no, that was my boss. I have to go.
Oh, what about this one. Rachel: OH!
Saw Regis Philbin once...
I wanted to be one with the waves, y'know?
Hey, what are you guys doing tomorrow night?
I'm sorry. Does the smoke bother you?
A garden salad for the lady.
I'm not sure I know what you're getting at.
Shut the door! Shut the door!!
Is your finger caught in that chair?
I am not going to apologize to a tree!
I got an extra one. You want this?
Oh, well we cut the trip short.
Hey Rach, I just heard. I'm so sorry.
Ohh! We're kidding! Oh, we're kidding!
You wrote that you have a cute touchie?
Uhh, I don't know, I just bring the scripts.
Oh no, I'm fully qualified to...
No, no, I ha-I have to give you something.
Ohh, Joey has the nicest friends!
God! What are you, in second grade?
Need uh, need a little hand there.
My parents are going to be really mad.
You're gonna keep an eye on us?
Yes! Yes! Please, just give it to me!
That was an accident! And so were you.
That's it, feel the rhythm. That's better.
So uh, I'm on my way back to the bathroom.
Oh, this is so good you have got to try it.
I can't imagine what he sees in her.
After you, miss Banana Hammock.
We really do feel bad about this though.
All right, ten centimeters, here we go.
I'm telling you, you never gave them to me.
Ough, I know, but I quit smoking!
Mmmh, those fries look delicious.
Uh, the usher told us to come...
Well, you know your insurance will cover that.
Suddenly, I very aware that I'm naked.
Really, y'think so? I don't..
Seriously, your dad doesn't like pranks.
No, Ross' sister was really fat.
Okay, so umm, what's your friend's name?
Yeah, that's pretty much what I had in mind.
Seriously. Wanna make one of those?
Joey there's a girl on the phone for you.
So, you wanna get a hamburger or something?
Yeah. Her. All of them. Anyone.
Monica, Chandler. I'd like you to meet Erica.
Hi honey, I've got a cab waiting.
Okay, fine, whatever. Welcome to the building.
Uh, a little woozy, but basically okay.
Hey, how do you guys get anything done?
Night Richard. Good luck Mon.
Back on in 30 seconds people!
Hi, hi. So.. Dreading this?
Were you this cute in high school?
Uh, your door isn't sound proof.
Okay, okay. But this is her last chance.
Nooo. Uh-huh, no way. What? No.
Things change, roll with em.
Sure, sure. Come on... ...in...
No that's not true. That is not true.
So the light went out in my refrigerator...
I'll see you later, sweetie. Bye Joey.
Madame, you must have your boarding pass..
So we never got to hear about your wedding!
It's a money thing, we don't have any.
I was her accountant four years ago.
And who is this little cutie pie?
That you and daddy were not on a break.
Kidding! God, I feel wild today!
Right there! That's my car! Hey!!
You have no idea who I am, do you.
Oh my God! What's wrong with your baby?!
Hey Chandler, here's this morning's projections.
As long as you don't see Rachel anymore.
Okay, but I get to hop on after her.
No, but this wonder broom is amazing!
Anyway, I'm guessing you hired somebody.
Yeah. You do know I was talking about you, right?
Better think of a new name for him.
You're welcome. I'm sorry. Did I hurt you?
Think she got fired at Riffs?
So... they sss-still seem normal.
A couple of hours, I feel awful.
Awkward? Why should he feel awkward?
Hey, do you want to go away this weekend?
You're stomping. It's disturbing my birds.
Oh wow. I really wish you'd call me.
How to make the next one even shorter?
Geez, we're gonna be late, sweetie...
Uh, your finger was covering the lens.
I don't know. Are they Greek Orthodox?
"Monica, it's Richard. Call me."
Oh, you mean it? That would be so fun!
Uhh, we were just in the neighbourhood, so...
Really?! Congratulations. When's the big day?
No, I'm leaving to get my hair dyed.
I'm getting my cigarettes out of my jacket.
Yeah, sure-sure, yeah, we're-we're-we're-we're-we're clicking.
We were surprise that we weren't invited.
Oh that explains all the women's underwear.
Anyway, I just wanna give you a heads up.
So, what time is Monica supposed to get here?
Oh wow, are those stuffed clams?
It's the baby's buttock, she's breech.
Another Minute Maid fiasco.
Five! Four! Three! Applause!
Jingle bells, jingle bells...
Oak, maple, elm, birch...
Almost! But first, we gotta start.
Oh don't worry, I'm not really a party girl.
Okay, but only if you give me a drag.
You're kidding, we wouldn't have missed it!
I was thinking about taking my lunch break.
No problem. So who's the party for?
No suds, no save. Ok?
Yeah. Did you tell someone that I was gay?
Mmmm... Ethan is my... boyfriend.
It's pretty much all the information you need.
Yes, it was very offensive to my people!
Well, I suppose I could give him a warning.
Yeah. Could you just sign right here please?
Yup, and waaay out of your league.
I-I can't go in there. I can't tell him!
No, that's cold, that's cold, that's...
Fill this out and bring it back to me.
Would you like some more coffee, baby-doll?
So, how's married life treating you?
Well, y'know, I never know how much to tip.
Well, that doesn't mean she can't look nice!
Stop the bus! Wait! Wait! Wait!
So... your resume is quite impressive.
Thanks. You're, uh, you're a good kid.
Would you mind doing a picture with us?
Yeah, it's my cat. Give me my cat.
Okay, you're dancing with that girl over there.
It looks like we're about ready over here.
Absolutely amazing! The part is yours.
Gosh, Ross, you know, you seem a little...
Cut! That was great everybody! Thank you!
I FEEL THE SAME WAY!
I write erotic novels, for children.
I'm having a conversation here! You were saying?
Santa has reindeers that can fly!
Anyway, hopefully, I'll see you around sometime.
The game is over, we eat now?
I don't understand, why didn't you help that man?
Hey, can we get some cappuccino over here?
Chandler, I like Joey a lot, but with you...
So, how come you wanted to eat in tonight?
I told that guy who answered your phone.
Excuse me. Excuse me. Sweetheart! Come!
Gotcha. Thanks again for meeting with me.
: Serve the ball, chump.
Hi, nice to meet you. Kate Miller.
Rachel, you didn't tell me your boyfriend smoked.
Well, you never told me how old you were.
Mike is your ex... uh... boyfriend!
Eh, why don't we start with the beer?
Oh my God, does she really thinks that?
Why does she keep making that noise?
Alright, that sounds like a two person job.
All right, that's it. I want both of you out.
Excuse me... This hospital is for people!
Oh come on! Don't be such a baby!
Yeah, well, uh, we're kind of a thing now.
Or we could throw you both in now!
Why? Wh-What are you going to do about it?
Uhh, I won't take no for an answer.
Get a shot of Monica. Where's Monica.
Hello Emma. Happy eighteenth birthday.
So are you his mother or his father?
Madame, if you don't have your boarding pass...
So... how many guys have your key?
You wanna know why. You wanna know why?
They said stuff to me too, y'know!
Here we go, one Hazelnut Latte.
Can-can we take a look at your ticket?
I tell you, this wedding is not going to happen.
Actually we're out of the lobster ravioli.
I'm gonna be really late for dance class!
No. But that reminds me, sign this.
Well, let's go to a bad one and make out.
I'm sorry Joey that's...that's the way it is.
We were just chit-chatting. How's your friend?
Excuse me, you're Monica Geller aren't you?
I'll let you two guys get acquainted, huh?
The sexy blonde behind the counter.
You want me to kick you guys out instead?
Yeah I can, it worked real well.
What do you think? You in the blue shirt.
You can watch our tape if you want.
Oh please God, let there be a song.
Anyway, I've decided to offer you the grant.
Really Mr. Geller, you don't have to do this.
Have a seat through the glass doors.
Oh I'm not, I just like to try these on.
Mommy is so proud of you. Hi. Hi.
Oh.. Never mind. Who are you?
You're not the fan who's dying are you?
No Joey! I knew you wouldn't be supportive!
Oh god, don't tell me, I did it wrong.
You gonna slice them up real nice?
Hi, Joey. Well well, look what you brought.
Hey, hey. Good to meet you, Roger.
Do you think that maybe, sometime, I could...
Umm, anyway...Do you want to have dinner tonight?
Well, that's why you wanted me to come, right?
Ooh, that's great, I love those little guys.
That must have been one lousy movie.
Alright, lady, now give me your purse!
Can I get you a cup of coffee, Sir?
They still want me for General Hospital.
Oh, it wasn't just me. We had a club!
Did you bring me any presents, Santa?
Nothing. I, I just remembered I have to leave.
It's me, I've been sleeping with your wife.
Jack? I hate him! He's a jerk.
Well, here's a schedule of what's coming up.
Those earrings look really lovely on you.
Here comes the beep, you know what to do.
Just so I know, if I had asked first...
Ah, I thought I'd find you here, Nasforatool.
And what will that be on the side of?
What a nice surprise! What are you doing here?
Well, we determined the cause of the fire.
What are they like? I've never had one.
Well of course not, but you were very good.
My parents say I'm gonna make new friends.
I am afraid you are gonna have to take a seat.
Umm, Ross. May I have a word with you?
I certainly see what the girls like coming here.
So that's your second marriage in two years.
My name is Gary, I live upstairs.
Well uh if you must know I'm a widower.
It seemed like such a simple idea.
Three for excavation and two for analysis.
No! No dessert, just a check, please.
Um.. we should really be sitting for this.
Alright, alright, I can get my own coat.
Would you like to spend the night in jail?
I know! I-I'm a big fan of yours.
No, no, we're here to give the money back.
Okay, all right... Get ready ladies!
I didn't mean a thong... I meant thongs...
I can show you an ID if you want?
Wait that's-that's, what that's not what you do?
Oh, we're having spaghetti! That's.... easy.
No-no-no, we'll move you just stay right there.
Well, actually, you only got to sing 'Memo-'.
Hey! You have no right to tell me what to do.
Mom, Dad, what are you guys doing here?
Can I borrow the keys to your apartment?
You wanna go down to the office right now?
Here's your check. That'll be $4.12.
Did I put too much rum in here?
Oh, well, is it what we thought it would be?
Tribbiani! Hold on, I'll get the plunger.
Why don't you fill out this address card.
No! No boom-boom before big fight!
Yeah, ummm, I don't like the hat that much.
Now don't worry! Everything's gonna be okay.
I'm sorry, it's just that you're so incredibly beautiful.
Thanks a lot. Hey Christine, I got it!
This is the boarding call for Flight 009.
You in the back, you're getting it all wrong!
I'd be happy to. You are very sweet.
Would you like to cut the umbilical cord?
I think my uterus just skipped a beat.
Uhh, yeah, I think I'm going to take-off too.
Remember all that stuff I taught you yesterday?
Hang it up! Hang up the phone!!
Are you okay? You seem kind of quiet.
What? Oh my God, there's really money in here.
Hmm Phoebe, were you ever in a sorority?
Hi! So, how did it go at the doctors?
Wait, you guys think I stole some ring?
Chandler, one of us has got to be strong.
No, no, there's no rush or anything.
Well, if there is anything else you wanna know...
Well, then he's, he's probably just, out.
Actually.. It's stuff you left at my apartment.
But please, let's just forget the whole thing.
I thought I would, but the translation's no good.
The doctor says it's a matter of hours.
You can't ask us son, that's cheating.
You really think this man is speaking French?
You do?! Wait, I like umm, the Beetles.
Yes. Are you one of the retarded cousins?
So, I got the results of the amnio today.
What's this? Blue nail polish?
Well then you really don't need me to live with you.
Well, if you stay till 9:20, I am.
Let's get you into wardrobe for a fitting.
Yeah, if the best is like unbelievable pain!
Well... there is just one small... stipulation...
I thought I heard voices. You must be Chandler.
Hey, hey, hey, her stuff wasn't in it.
Let us begin. Dearly beloved...
Oh I'm sorry, Jack's father is not available.
How could you have kept all of this from me?
Uh, excuse me folks this is a uhh...
I don't understand, do you want to go out with Ross?
Sure Just not as much as clams.
Anyway I just, uh, I think it's for the best.
Just a sec. Hope you find your monkey.
Oh, but the party's only just getting started!
You, you want, you want me to move out?
Oh, yeah, my firm represents the band.
You wanna talk, I mean I can come over?
Well, we were very young when we had her.
No! What are you going to do? Make me?
Hey! How come I haven't seen you here before?
That's fair, you've had a long trip.
I'll just run to the store and get some.
You can tell her I think her friend is cute.
Yep. Yep, that's what I didn't want to know.
What'd you do, dip it in sugar?
What's the matter with you? Get out of here!
I don't have any great ideas. I am eight.
Uh, we're going down to Colonial Williamsburg.
Hey, that's weird, today's my birthday too!
Boy I would just uh, I would freak out.
Umm, I'm gonna just go get this warmed up.
Ahh, I'd throw another thousand on that.
Flight's in an hour. I-I gotta go.
Hey, you don't have to smile. You just have to dance.
Ma'am, I assure you, the plane is fine.
But you know what might really cheer me up?
I am so glad that you could come over tonight.
You can't sit here if you're not gonna play.
That was Phoebe Buffay, the porn star.
She went to pick up Aunt Liddy.
This guy! He has a killer apartment.
Nothin' roomie, just watchin' you sleep.
Really?! Well see? I never knew about her.
I'm pressing, a policeman is on his way.
You expect me to believe.. Hi Ralph.
Your mom called me. So is this her?
This guy? Seriously? Later in the day.
Yeah, it's not. But I'm rich and thin.
If this is your idea of sexy talk?
Wow! That's wild! No, I had no idea.
It's okay! Shh! Hey. Hey. Shhhh.
You are so precious, I could just take you home.
Hey! I'm proud of that sauce, it's delicious.
I actually needed to talk to you before the birth.
What did we just finish talking about Ben?!
And we were both in the Peace Corps.
I have to be heading to my chateau, thank you.
Wait! Wait! There is the train station!
I can't believe we go on in, in a week.
In twenty seconds it'll be midnight...
Mmm-hmm. Because I know that this isn't the end.
Oh, you're back... this is my wife, Nancy.
Jack, give me that. Talk to your son.
I really don't think it's a very good idea, Phoebe.
I wanted to say how much I enjoyed your class.
Umm, Ginger's gonna take over this corner.
Excuse me. Can, can I help you with something?
This is huge, you can buy me beer.
Well we left ours in Monica's bedroom.
I know this is crazy but am I too late?
All right, he's crowning. Here he comes.
What happened to the, uh, puppet guy?
I won't! Until I have my next cigarette.
Oh my God! There's a toe in my kitchen.
Yeah. No, this is great. Thank you, Chandler. .
I was wondering if I could talk to you for a moment?
Yeah. Okay great. Im gonna be over here.
You know what. I think this audition is over.
Well why not you changed Ned's grade!
If you're talking about feminism, I think you're right.
Well umm, maybe if it had more heat.
"What the hell are you still doing here"?
Phoebe, your next client's in the waiting room.
Oh, you watched the show! What'd you think?
Thank you for your patience, you're the next caller.
Absolutely. Some people are just into appearances.
What are you doing? I thought you don't share food.
I'll be right back. Make yourself comfortable.
So who made her queen of the world?
Well uh, Ross? This is Joey. Joey? Ross.
The joke Bing. What's the matter with you?
Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife?
Could we see something in a slimmer heel?
You feel that too? Oh, I thought that was just me!
Well she said she had to think things over.
Alright mister, let's see those panties.
We want candy! We want candy now!
You already hit on me an hour ago.
Do you have a moment to talk about your lecture?
That is great. Good work! Chandler. Thank you.
Charlie! My God, you look absolutely stunning!
Well, I think Brian's a little out of your league.
Oh, yeah. Wasn't that like a year ago?
Understood. So, what'd you say back then?
Oh, right. He is so great. But that's over.
I miss you to. Well, at least I think I do.
Is he alright out there by himself?
We're going to take Erica to recovery now.
Hi! Hi. Hi, Rachel! What's she doing here?
Very clean! It looks great! Terrific!
He's here. I'm assuming one of you is the father.
Okay. He's cute, he's funny, he's-
Doesn't it make her nose look smaller?
Thanks for everything, I had such a great time.
Hi, I'm Joshua, I'm here to pick up Rachel.
Yeah, I-I'm taking pledges here, eh?
All right, thank you so much for all your help.
I'm surprised to, but yet here I am.
Hey. Ursula said she left her purse.
Suddenly I'm seeing him go off to college.
Carol, Carol, sweetie. Cleansing breath.
But they're so dull, they're all opthamologists.
I love your place! Where is this guy from?
Well, I will, because I won't be playing with you.
Listen uh, maybe we could get together later?
Ah what?! Jessica hates horses!
When I'm in a relationship, I love having a girlfriend.
Oh, I gotta get to work. So call me later?
Wait a minute, wait, this is because of you?
Hey! Are you ready to try nursing again?
Who-who else is in vice up there?
And while we're on the subject of news..
Well, Ross and I were in grad school together.
I'll be back in an hour to check you again.
We'll just get him cleaned up a bit.
Y'know I really want to move this relationship forward.
Oh, hey Rach! I thought we said seven?
Oh no! Where to? Too Paris?
Uh, Racquela tell me you massage, eh?
They're your backup singers... beind you.
No! It's where you put the dirty ones!
Your make-up kit? I'd feel better.
It's great. You're gonna be the hit of the conference.
So uh Chandler, you like that badge I got you?
Oh yes. Yes, yes, I am, uh-hmm.
Very good Monica! You know where they are.
Don't worry about it already. Things happen.
Oh wow! So, you're more than just dinosaurs.
Where's the 1920s princess cut ring.
I was just, I was just gonna take out my lenses.
Wow, my flat is twice this size!
Hey. They're just trying to decide somehting.
You can forget about Emily, she's not with us.
Aren't you in my Popular Culture class?
You wouldn't happen to have a very big fork?
Macaroni and cheese! We gotta make this!
Me neither. So you're like my big sister.
Oh, Mr. Scientist has to get all technical!
What is taking so long?! I mean whatever!
Oh, that's too bad. How'd they do it?
Loved your Stevie Wonder last night.
Sure! I'll get somebody to cover my shift.
We're all getting off. There is no Philange!
I mean, what the hell am I supposed to do now?
He always ridiculed my pottery classs...
So, ehm... I'm proposing to Pheobe tonight.
Well, I was probably going to do it at some point.
Oh my God, you are! And you're Rachel Green!
Dr. Farber, Jason Greenstein's gagging.
Then y'haven't. You're burning your tomatoes.
I missed you, too! So, how was your week?
...and you sand it and you varnish it...
Uh yes, I think I vaguely recall it.
Ok, ok, I'll throw away the traps.
Uh sir, may I see your tickets please?
You know.. this.. this is classic Rachel.
It ain't no thing, I'm wild too.
Not for her. Listen, I really wanted to thank you.
Oh! I'm gonna go wash up first. Thanks!
Hi, Ross. Yes, it's me. How did you know?
I'm Andrew, and I didn't pay for this pear.
Rachel, could you come in here for a moment, please?
I don't know man, we're really not supposed to do that.
Okay, thanks. I'll give you a call later tonight.
I wasn't thinking. I was too busy fallin'...
One uh, vegetarian pizza. That's $12.15.
Ross just read me his speech. It's fantastic!
Look, I'm gonna get better. Okay? I promise you.
Or if you prefer, this table is available.
I'm sorry, I can't tell the baby to wait for them.
No, Richard Burke gave them a ride.
Oh yeah, I'm so excited, I've never been there.
I moved back here a couple of months ago.
Why can't you get a girlfriend your own age?
Myron. Hmm... I told you he was old!
This is contestant number sixteen, Rebecca...
Oh, I was gonna talk to him about doing something tonight.
...and then Zana, just let one rip!!
Phoebe? The lady who sells toner?
Ross. You and I are going to have to have a little talk.
I missed you at work today. How are you feeling?
I'm sorry. That's always mr Campbell's table.
Uh, Phoebe, uh, I have... something I wanna say.
Yeah, the Knicks by 10. They suck.
Oh, hey, don't do that! Cut it out!
Um-hum. Talk New York to me again.
Hey, do you mind? We're under cover here.
So let's talk a little bit about your duties.
Op, this is saved. Gift shop.
Oh uh...I actually came here to ask you out.
Well our service is not grossly incompetent.
Tell me to stop, just...tell me to stop.
"I-I-I can't tell you somethin' I don't know."
Hi guys. I haven't seen you since this morning.
I've heard schho much about all you guyschh!
Changing one hundred! Good luck sir.
Umm, look I-I-I got a confession to make...
So, she has a boyfriend. What is your situation?
How are you doing? Are you feeling any better?
So, do you have any other question about advertising?
That's very thoughtful of you. It's very thougtful.
Actually, it turned out to be a lot of fun!
Well, the guy's worked here for 25 years.
There are a couple of forms to fill out.
Hey Joe does it have meatballs on it?
Doctor Geller, I'm such a huge fan!
For you and Emily, tonight, Die Fledermaus.
You know what makes the itching even worse?
Honey I swear! I wasn't looking at her!
But you just said "What's mine is yours"?
Wow, that's great! So, tell me about the grant!
Ross, why don't you give us your toast now?
Thank you. I'm going to rejoin my dinner party.
You're the only one who can save her Drake.
How about a hammer, or a small blade?
Well if it helps, it worked very well.
Could you also tell them I'm skinny now?
Oh, I miss you already. Can you believe this happened?
He is very sweet. Plus he's hot!
I put that tube top on as a joke.
Look, are you dating this girl you came with?
Well, the white seems to be untouched. Uh-oh.
So what are you saying? It's now or never?
Careful! They haven't quite taken yet.
She-she wasn't ready for a serious commitment.
Joey and Janice's DAY OF FUN!!!
Okay. Chandler, did your dad ever hug you?
No-no-no-no! Have a seat! Have a seat!
We're seriously asking for our money back?
There's no way in hell, I'm paying for it.
I got to go, so ah, I'll see you guys later.
So which one of you lucky boys is Chandler?
You said there was a gas leak in here.
In fact, ehm... I going to kiss you now.
Oh! Great! So how much does it pay?
Be right there. Be back in a sec.
Fire safety is not a joke, son.
If you have the time, I'd really appreciate the help.
I'll be right with you. Okay? Thanks, Wendy.
You think so? I've always kinda hated it.
Wait. Are you talking about the Dewar grant?
I have a question I was kinda gonna ask her myself.
Wait a minute, you don't have renter's insurance?!
Hey, lovely! Come, talk to me a minute!
The next baby should be along in a minute.
I think I might need one more cup of coffee.
No, no, I should get home, I'm kinda tired.
Is this guy, uhh, an old boyfriend?
Look, either you leave, or we remove you.
You're, hey, you're not paying for the pizza!
Hi, oh, I'm Lauren, Kate's understudy.
Ten centimeters, you're about to become a mom.
Don't you let her go! You're a lucky guy!
Yeah, it's the new building on Avenue A.
You don't want him, but you don't want me to have him?
Sorry David, but she really has to know this.
Ok, that's ok. I'm fine. I'm... oh!
Oh. Oh, sure, sure, uh, uh, how come?
Are you for Hanukkah, too? Because I'm part-Jewish.
So it was really cool seeing you lecture today.
Seeing some more of your super-cool slides.
Oh, there they are! I-I dropped my keys.
Hey, Joey. So did you hear about the new guy?
I used to be Bryce on All My Children.
Ah! Oysters! Let me feed you one.
I don't care. Why, do you want me to care?
Congratulations on your new boat, Joey Tribbiani!!
Welcome everybody, welcome to Amazing Discoveries!
But Rachel I thought she just had a baby with Ross.
Yeah Ross it's okay, it's me, Mr. Stevens.
Yeah, sounds like a good idea... Dr. Geller!
How about I order everyone the Moroccan chicken?
Wait, Ross. Ross. I - I have to take off.
You don't mind? Well, what do you know, it fits!
Give us a kiss. Come on! Come on!
That you enjoyed the occasional drink...ing binge.
So I guess you'd like to know how it all happened.
Mm! Seems like I would've remembered you!
Yeah, no we're not thirty. We're 31. Okay.
Well, he's a big boy, he'll get over it.
Marc Coreger, this is my wife Julie.
Oh you're right. Thank you! What's your name again?
Two days before Christmas? Sorry, man.
And we kinda figured about the porch swing.
No actually umm, I think that they're umm, gas.
Y'know what honey? I got to get back to the hospital.
Woo-wo-hey-hey-hey... Can we not talk about that right now?
Okay, we'll give a call if anything comes up.
Well, everyone seems to be enjoying your dish.
Joey! Here we go. Let's go very quickly!
I'm making change. I need change for the bus.
Oh, yeah, um, alright, I kinda need a divorce.
Yeah. Ooh, I know what this is missing! Alcohol!
I told 'em your candy is absolutely indescribable!
I-I'm sorry. I, I-I-I believe I ate that.
Keep the change. Sure you don't wanna pretzel?
You went out with her?! We had a pact!
The picture of my wife! In your pack!
Yeah... I'm pretty sure I'm still gonna marry him.
So why can't the three of us go out together?
Nancy and I were talking about the fall collection.
You're both gonna have to take this up with the judge.
Yeah, so, please don't fire me for doing this.
Thanks... uh... I'm so sorry about Ross, it's...
Hey. Listen, I want you to know how sorry I am...
You don't think they'll judge and ridicule me?
That's not true. If you don't wanna smoke ...
So, I'm surprised you agreed to have lunch with me.
Wow Bing! Burning the midnight oil.
You know what else? He's unbelievable in bed.
It's Petty. I'll be right back with your ticket.
It's time for me to conquer the physical world.
Ohh! What is that on your finger?! I'm blind!
Thank you, it's my mom's. So this is the kitchen.
Alright people, now everyone grab a partner.
A little mean? You made my life miserable!
Hi sweetie. Hi, can I talk to you for a second?
Oh right, that Rachel chick from the coffee place.
Do you have the, the Ralph Lauren file?
Take a seat. You okay? You feeling all right?
Good-bye and God speed, Hope Brady.
I dunno. Maybe you wanted your marriage to fail.
That sucks. I was buried in an avalanche.
Noth- I was- I was just saying to my-
Why don't we have dinner tonight and talk about it?
Oh, excuse me! I think you dropped s... Wow!
Actually, Alby is the guy I broke up with.
Alll right, we'll call you in a few minutes.
Isn't the Mastodon from the Pliocene Epic?
Look, um I really appreciate your coming down...
All those things I said about not being ready...
That's great. What kind of music do you play?
I mean, come on, buddy, get a real car!
Okay, there's an herbal tea you can drink.
I'm sorry... Ross Geller... Benjamin Hobart.
Good night, it was very nice to meet you all.
And then you tried to make me think that I was crazy.
Oh, they didn't tell me about your quick wit.
Yeah, we met in college. I mean, high school.
Well, you kids thank Dr. Burke for the ride?
I can't help it, I'm just, I'm just crazy about you.
Oh, wow! Yay! Wow! Hooray! Oh, man!
Maybe I'll just turn the lights down a little.
Great! But wh-wh-How do you know where I live?
I'm sorry that's who I am. I'm a positive person.
Yeah! Thank you so much for letting me stay here.
Your mother just added him to her list.
I believed you were saving this seat for someone.
I'm sorry. Semi-private rooms are all we have.
Actually, I think you're ready to go to the delivery room.
Yeah, what time do you wanna pick me up? Hello?
Well...I really have high hopes for my band.
Oh wait, Joey and I are supposed to have dinner .
Do you have fever? Let me see. Hum...
No, really, c'mon. You're smart, you're sexy...
After all, my parents died very young.
Uh, absolutely, yeah, sEnd her in. Hi.
Wait, this is important! Can Ella wait?
Ross you left you scarf in... Hey you guys.
Yeah, all the time. I want the baby to know my voice.
Mom, I thought I told you... Phoebe's a vegetarian.
Man, I could really flash somebody in this thing.
No no no, I wanna hear it from your lips.
I think it would make me wanna marry you even more.
Hey come on, you haven't heard my reason yet.
Whoa-whoa-whoa! I don't think so! Aren't you ovulating?
Yeah! Yeah, it was definitely an improvement. G'night.
We're at my stop. But would you like to have coffee?
I don't want to look at your file! This is over.
Michael, a pimp spit in her mouth!
Oh, actually, that's the shirt I wore to the gym.
No that's La Guardia. This is Mexico.
Hey, there's Phoebe! Is that Mike she's with?
...on the rocks with a twist? I remember.
The bathroom is down the hall, to your left.
Wow! Somebody wants people to know you have a boyfriend.
But uh, this is a study for identical twins.
I think you'll find this room more to your liking.
Would you like to go out and have a cup of coffee?
Sure, I'll just get my coat. Could you get that?
Monica, why have you brought me here of all places?!
Two pounds of Moca Java please.
There you are! Haaah, you got away from me!
This is your daughter? I can be your new mummy!
Oh, that's so... It really is...do we know...?
Oh, well, I'm so glad you brought him here then.
Oh great! Thanks Ross, you're such a good friend!
I think you just have a cold, it's definitely not Strep.
Hi! Hi. I think I left my keys here somewhere.
Does he, uh, fight with other animals?
I-I think I'm gonna look around a little bit more.
What do you think of adding him to our team?
Thanks, Bernice. Let's go away this weekend.
Why don't all of you tell me a little about your self?
Uhh, we know, he already did it last week.
Wait! No! No! It's my hamster! It's Mitzi!
Gloves. Brown, leather dress gloves.
Our table will be ready in a couple minutes.
Y'know, I don't really know you well enough for you to do that.
Your outgoing message has now been changed.
We just know she's got the IQ of a napkin.
Ok, would you care for my seat as well?
No he, he moved out and I moved in.
My name in Mike, and I do play piano.
Hmm, come on, you just said to her that you....
Wait a minute, his name is Dr. Bobby?
Oh, what are you, stupid? It's been three hours.
That's great! That's great! I-I'll propose to her!
I know you do but you and I can never be together that way.
Okay, no problem. Could you come here for a second?
Whoa, whoa, whoa . She cringed!
Yeah but it wasn't for me, it was for a friend.
The pizza-place across the street any good?
Forget the platoon! The platoon is gone!
Well, now we've gotta find something fun for you!
Y'know how the garage floods every Spring?
No, I'll be fine... I just should check the stitches...
I gather by that oh that he told you about me.
Well you can split it with another credit card.
The only man I've ever been with is your father.
One swift kick and he'll back off.
Okay, I just slapped my future sister-in-law's ass.
Did you know my husband has glasses just like that?
Maybe it wasn't Bob, maybe it was a mouse.
Wha, you know, maybe we can do something else!
Come on Phoebe! You can do it Phoebe! Come on!
I just never would have pictured Richard with a bimbo.
Sir! I'm afraid I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
Of course it did. They're made of wicker.
Umm, Alice ah, she ah, called it off.
Yep. I'm gonna wear these on our date tonight.
Hey! How's my pal Toby doing today?
He's under sedation, so he's pretty much out.
It took you that long to figure it out, huh?
Totally! Wow! Would you excuse me for a sec?
Is this the same spoon that was in my cast?
It doesn't really seem like enough to be fate.
Oh, dear. Jack, how do I turn this off?
Oh, 200 seconds of passion. We gotta go.
Uh, how is he at handling small objects?
What, you don't think they can hear sounds in there?
With him? You're is favourite, you're his guy!
Ahh-ahh, we'd better call the fire department!
Barley? What kind of party serves barley?
Mm. Unless we go with a different dress?
Hi! It's Tom, I'm here to pick up the phone.
Well, I hope you're gonna bid on some things Rachel.
If you didn't have your shirt tucked into them.
Come here, come here. Okay, don't get mad, okay.
Don't you talk to my husband like that you stupid bastard!
I - I just have to say this; you're really beautiful.
You-you-you said you were gonna be away all weekend!
Okay. I-But I think we should still have this conversation.
She could have been talking about either one of us.
No but... You don't want to get married either right?
I've got bad news. The Chinese guy left.
You're on fire! I'll call you in the morning, okay?
...Dammit, hire the girl! Okay, everybody ready?
Don't wink at me. And put on your apron.
Why don't you ask the reverend to pray on it?
Well, that's just probably 'cause of your Amish background.
Not you. Relax. Ever have to fire anyone?
Did not, she did not wink at you....
Hey. Are you all right? You seem a little distracted.
I'm really sorry but I may be a little while longer.
Oh, oh, I can do it for her, if you want...
Hey, how's my favorite parenting team doing?
That's my monkey. That's Patti, Patti the monkey.
Fine, then let's just say he's not my type.
Completely anonymous. From two kind strangers.
That's right, The I Hate Rachel Green Club!
Hey. Look, I'm sorry about yesterday, I, um-
Huh, I would've thought it was the other way around.
Anyway uh, I'll get moving on that new door.
Hey! Paul! Hi! The Wine Guy! Hey!
Oh wow, you look great! Glad you could make it.
Done it. I'll be back in a couple of hours.
Yes, because that's how long it takes to love me.
Well, then who's been dead for five years?
Goat cheese, water chestnuts, and panchetta.
Y'know you don't have to stand here with me, believe me...
... is it weird that it's not with each other?
Oh, wait a second! I didn't say I wasn't free!
Right, at the end, you choked on a cookie.
Uh, Rachel, sweetheart, could I see ya for a minute?
Do you even know what a banana hammock is?
You too, you let uh, your hair grow long.
No, you're my first. Put the money on the table.
We've gotta go, we've got that cab waiting.
Oh, I thought there was a mirror there. Okay, bye-bye.
Monica, I want to become the Ultimate Fighting Champion.
Ross, there's one thing that really scares me still.
This is worse than when he married the lesbian.
Hello. Well, Joshua, that $500 was for groceries.
Your loyal loving boyfriend Ross..... Ross!
To see who goes first, you got a quarter?
Well, when I tell my friends about her she will be.
There was also leaves and guk and stuff.
I'm sorry. Christmas is a very busy time, sir.
So, what is this information worth to you, my friend?
Well, I kinda did. Me. Eight weeks of me.
Well, there's a service in progress. Have a seat.
All right, it's time to act, my talking props.
Not on purpose, he ricocheted of you and got me.
Here's the Shelly Siegal stuff from December.
I'm pretty sure, professor Spafford from Cornell?
I guess I just figured of all people you would understand this.
Well, Chandler and I used to make out! A lot!
Well, Telia Shire suddenly became available.
One of the best, ma'am, one of the best...
Well don't forget that fiches over there by Rachel.
Uh actually, I'd like to speak with both of you.
Y'know who I ran into from school? Howie.
Wow! Everything looks great! Where should I sit?
Hi. I'm here for Ross Geller's memorial service.
Jij Hebt Seks Met Ezels.
Ice coffee? Tell me it's ice coffee!
Come on, Erica, start pushing again now.
Last stop, Montreal. This stop is Montreal.
In a minute. You-you checked today's Post?
Okay, thank you. It's the Italian Hand-Licker, isn't it.
Oh God! You see, that's what I was afraid of!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, the poem is not about you.
I must say it's nice to see you back on your feet.
Mmm. Bob Buttons. Here, Bob Buttons.
Hi, I'm Eric, I'm gonna be Chandler's new roommate.
And guess what? Good news! I got another job!
You-you work at one of those massage parlors?
I'm good except umm, you still owe me a dance.
We've lost visual contact with the suspect.
Oh look, look there's your old makeup kit!
Umm, nothing. I mean, I'm getting married next week.
I'm just going to say hi to the lads. All right?
You guys, the water's great. You should really go in.
Hey! Hey! No rough holding in my ER!
How do you spell that? So we can get it right.
Why do have a picture of Paulette in your pack?!
Yoko. I've decided to go to Minsk without you.
Mr. Simon's been waiting for- Oh my God!
Im sorry, I didnt get... Susan is?
This is the final boarding call for Flight 009.
Huh. Nice to meet you. I'll get started on this.
Well, yeah! I mean yeah, but only for three days.
I'm sorry we can't store your childhood things anymore.
It's not true. I never called your mother a wolverine.
Oh my God! No-no-no! Please! Please! Don't-don't-don't!
Excuse me. Doesn't this come with a side salad?
Did we not make ourselves clear the other day.
Shut up! I did not sound like that at all!
I'm fine. No, I'm not alone... I don't know, some guy.
I'm thinking that you are looking really fine it that dress.
Well, maybe after we get reacquainted uh, you can do me.
Sooo, Richard's shopping in the junior section.
I don't think that's gonna affect the plot of the show.
-if it's a boy, Minnie if it's a girl.
Okay. Do you think maybe sometime I could take you out?
Oh yeah, well I just started wearing bras again.
But... Well now, now's a different time for me.
Hey, hi, I need a ladle. You got a ladle?
Like 'em? I could eat a hundred of them!
Here are the boards for Friday's pitch .
Ahh, then you have to give us the lawn ornaments.
Monica told you I was cuter that this, didn't she?
How did you know they were in my bottom drawer?
Hey, what kind of puppy do you think I should get?
Oh, I'm Ronni. Ronni Rappelano? The mistress?
Hey, uh can I get a little piece of that cake?
See, this is just the kind of thing I was talking about.
Yeah, I'm looking for Phoebe, does she still live here?
Oh, right. Um, I've got some news. It's about us.
Now, let us try that again, shall we?
Oh no, not all the time... I do the best I can...
Of course we'll help! Yeah! We'll be here!
Rach, I'm sorry, but you didn't give me any contracts!
What're you gonna do, suck the door open?
Can-can I get your autograph, I'm your biggest fan.
Is it okay if I finish the apple juice?
Charla, 278. Sorry, dear, but still good.
Oh my god, Todd! What the hell did you do?
Well that sounds simple enough, let's just do that.
I'm sorry sir, these are for the pharmaceutical convention.
He'll be here OK, take a chill pill.
I mean this is so great! We're gonna be baby buddies!
You're pretty much running that risk either way.
Oh! My number is on there. Give me a call.
Great! I'm looking forward to it. Rachel, any messages?
Joey? Do you want me to put it all in your room?
Whoa, hey, that lady's all kinds of naked.
I don't think the next patient is very far along.
Oh wow, I didn't get you anything. Here's five back.
3, 2, 1. Happy New Year.
What're we looking at? That blue freckle?
Okay, I-I get the picture. Uh, thanks, for your time.
Sure will. I've uh, gotta go. Take care.
Yeah. Well see ya upstairs. See ya pals.
Happy birthday, sweetie! Give us a hug!
The movie theatre, you used to come in all the time.
Now, remember, nobody else drives that cab.
I just want to say that Ross is a wonderful young man.
It was horrible. They called me chicken boy.
It's just that we do have some large parties waiting.
...just because you're not in love with the guy you can't...
Oh y'know, we really should quit. Okay, let's quit!
Well you guys, I'm outta here. See ya pals.
Fine, I'm sorry, I didn't think it was that big a deal.
Well actually, did either of you pay for this class?
Being a doctor must take up a lot of time.
What the hell, it's for a good cause! All right!
I had so much fun tonight, and what a great restaurant.
We're great, I think I may have asked all my questions.
Sorry about that. So. What have you been up to?
Ready? "What the hell are you still doing here?"
She's helped so many people to quit smoking.
Yeah. Maybe it's for the best. You smell just like her.
Ohh, okay. Something didn't quite add up there.
No, actually, um, we talked about Helen Willick-Bunch.
Now, that can be arranged! Slippery little bugger!
We're waiting for the candy. Bring out the candy!
Do you ah, currently own a set of encyclopedias?
Do you know how fast you were traveling back there?
So, why do you let her go to a chiropractor for?
Oh, no thanks. I always carry one in my sock.
What's the matter honey? Did you see a little mouse?
All right, I'll tell her. Come on bugger face!
...of course you can kick his ass son.
You're kidding! I-I spent three years in Amsterdam.
No! Why can't the Armadillo leave? I want Santa!
Well it's wonderful to have you up and about, again, dear.
Hello, Sir. You're here to return those pants?
She did? Who got her condo in Boca?
Oh, wow. I can't believe you're throwing that in my face.
You didn't cancel the fabric order from Taiwan?
He has the most amazing Porsche under there!
Not possible! She's gonna be Mrs. No Balls.
Well, I don't understand why Adrienne's attracted to Victor.
Ross, let me show you where the guest room is.
No I'm here to take Emma to your mother's, remember?
So ah, there was this thing I wanted to talk to you about.
Oh. God, crazy Chandler. He spun me...off...the...bed!
Makes me feel um, peaceful, heh-heh, please.
It's an all Chinese cast. Can you be Chinese?
Ok. I heard a joke today. It's pretty funny...
Okay, good. Thank you. I'll be back shortly, all right?
Oh my God. This plane doesn't even have a Philange!
You know! At the place I told you about last night?
Then why did it have the word eternity in it?
So, tonight's the night of the big bachelor party?
My god. You still have your Christmas lights up?
I've looked everywhere. There's no gas leak.
I was wondering if you would consider coaching me for it?
Is there any entertainment there? What are people doing?
That's the best one! Oh my God, thank you so much!
Uh... uh... what're'you... what're'you guys doing here?
What? So you never went out with an actress before?
Good evening, Miss. Miss? Miss? Miss!
Hey, hey, hey there aren't any clothes in it.
Alright, turn around. Time to see you from behind.
I...I-I don't know, but I would say it's pretty good-o.
Nice hair. What'd ya do? Swim here?
Fine, it's fine... I'll just shower by myself...
Oh my god! Those guys are stealing my car!
Well, I'm not I'm not at all surprised they feel that way.
Sergei, would like to apologise for my behaviour tonight.
Jack. Could you come in here for a moment? NOW!
It's out there man! I've seen it! I got it!!
No, I'm bored with you now. I'm going to cut you off.
Mockolate. It's a completely synthetic chocolate substitute.
Oh, that's ok. I don't care which of them I beat.
It'd be even more exciting if we were going.
Oh, Ross? Ross! You can't put up flyers in here.
I sincerely hope the rest of your party is returning.
Yeah, can you guys just throw him in the pool later?
No, no, no, not the Mets, the MET, singular!
Okay ahh, well, just ahh, follow my lead.
Way to go son! I knew you'd find him!
Don't worry about it, I just didn't realize you were married.
So, if you were home right now, what would you be doing?
Look, if I wanna see Phoebe and she wants to see...
Hey, I wonder if you can see my apartment from up here.
Because that would be fantastic. What? You wanna kiss me?
Wait, how do you zoom out? There she is.
All right, the man in the picture is Chuck Magioni.
No, it's hard enough to get women to go out with me.
Marty's still totally paranoid. Oh, and, uh-
Rachel we tried to quit, but it was too hard!
Thank you so much! 'Cause I-I know I can do better!
I know what you're thinking Judy, the resemblance is uncanny!
Because I think about shaving it all off again sometime.
Why, did something happen to his falafel cart?
Which bedroom do ya want it in Miss Geller?
Really! Now this all better be here when I come back.
Knock knock!How are we today? Any nausea?
Australia, I just moved here a couple of weeks ago.
Okay, okay, come on, you can do it. You can do it!
Have the final numbers on my desk by Tuesday.
They say he's only got half a tank left.
Alright, I gotta report you. What's your medallion number?
You know what your problem is? You're threatened by me.
You got sprayed with two two' s and...
Oh right, you've got a church group meeting tonight.
Boy, I'm glad I wore the big belt today.
Smelly cat, smell-ly cat, it's not your fault.
Sir, this is not a first class ticket. I'm sorry.
I know, we did it!! Hey, that was incredible, huh?!
Hey! Hey! This is ah, my fiance, Mrs. Knight.
I found it. Finders keepers, losers weepers.
Umm, actually, I came down to ask you a big favour.
I just can't believe that Mike didn't give me any warning.
G. I. Joe. G. I. Joe?!
So you see Wigglemunch, that's why it's important to shaaaaaaare...
Look, I gotta go. I'm on call tonight. See you Saturday.
Yeah but Jessica doesn't have an English accent.
Absolutely, this will just be something we do, like racquetball.
So you spied on me. I can't believe you don't trust me.
This bill for my half of the wedding. it's insane.
98 hot saves, highest in the force.
I can't handle two nights in a row with them.
Oh and your agent said you were okay with the nudity.
So you really think those newspapers are just jealous of me?
You wanna return this couch? It's cut in half!
Happy?! Is that what I'm supposed to be Vic? Happy?
I should tell you that crying women make me very uncomfortable.
We're not throwing it away! I built that canoe!
Hi Phoebe, nice to meet you. So, how ya been?
It's just hard when I know I have e-mail I can't get!
Joey, you don't have to count down every time we kiss.
I'm sorry, that information is restricted to hospital staff...
So? Congratulations you two, I didn't even know you got married.
Yea-huh! That's what is says on my birth certificate.
I'm sorry, but isn't your wife back in New York?
The bedroom. Well it's pretty much your typical... bedroom.
I'm Mrs. Dr. Barry Hunter hyphen Farber.
Hello Ross. I love what you've done with this space.
Bing! We're all set for tonight, 8 o'clock.
Uh, can we have three chocolate mousses to go please?
Uh no, they're still here but I think I'm about to leave.
I don't know. I don't remember a lot of things that never happened.
Meet me in the nocturnal house in 15 minutes.
I have a wonderful idea. You should take Rachel to the prom.
Wow! Didn't she die like five years ago?
Hey, you've been here five years, you figure it out.
This is a great place. How long have you lived here?
Listen, it was nice to see you. I gotta run backstage.
Actually the wet season is June to December.
Coming in, we got a shooter! Money please.
Oh that's all right, I'm coming back later with your father.
I'm not trying to pull anything. Look I love you dude.
Is there, anything in this record that is actually true?
Fine. I'll go. But let me ask you one question...
Her name's Ronni. She's a pet mortician.
I can't believe that Ross is gone. It is just so sad.
Well. Your mom didn't tell us about the blobbies.
I know. I was sweepin' yesterday. It coulda been me.
It's the key to my Porsche. Well, the key to your Porsche.
Please, it's because otherwise I really don't know what I might do.
No, I'm sorry. It's just my foot itches like crazy.
Well yeah, it usually, it takes two people to...
I-I can't believe this! You-you've slept with him?!
And we'll need you and Rachel to testify before a judge.
Paul the Wine Guy? Oh yeah, I know Paul.
I don't see any reason why I would do that to myself again.
Can't you see what's going on here, this man is dead.
...says $30 Father; same as in town.
So why did you plan a party at the same time?
I can write an epic poem about this lip.
I want to talk to that bastard, see what his problem is.
Oh great! I'll keep it in my butt with your nose.
Ohh, I love Chinese! How did you know I love Chinese?!
Can you believe how we spent our two weeks together?
Yeah, he took the other one off and hit me with it.
wow. They must put a lot of makeup on you.
I don't know, I'm still pretty tired out from this afternoon.
Oh, thank god, it's not Mitzi. It's just a rat.
Since today... I am going to be a baby stylist.
Oh, I-I'm just making a list of people's birthdays.
We've only known each other for six weeks!
Can't you see what's going on here, this man is dying.
Well, I was thinking, why doesn't he give Monica a call?
Hold on. Fill these out, sit over there.
He's good with rear things, bring him in too.
Yeah, and I have a time share in the Pocanos with Flipper.
So how come it took you so long to ask me out?
And "X" is spelled uhm... "Mike Hannigan".
Well, you're just going to say no again but...gay porn.
I just, I y'know, I'm not very good at this. So, umm...
Are you rehearsing for some really bad mafia movie?
Suspect has just emerged naked from the sewer.
Uh, except that it was really the I Hate Rachel Club.
I'm sorry. Could you, could you try it without the purse?
There's an indoor pool, you can swim there!
No, it's a water balloon fight! We started it!
Ever since she walked out on me, I, uh...
Uh, in the future, if I could see the schedule beforehand...
I need these hangers separated ASAP. You're welcome.
Y'know, twin stuff is always a real big seller.
Thanks! Do you have a coaster? I don't wanna make a ring.
Wow, excuse me, sir, do you have a boarding pass?
Don't worry son, we'll just attach it and-
You're telling me this couch was delivered to you like this?!
Excellent! What Rachel has shrewdly observed here...
And you know, you can just give me my stuff whenever you want.
Oh. Look, just friends, I won't grope you. I promise.
Yeah, but it-it-it's my whole life-you come to England.
My God what a fantastically well lit hallway!
Ok, so it's a tie again, 41 to 41.
Oh believe me, Ross, I won't be telling anybody about this.
We went through the same thing when we were adopting.
So when do I get to meet Emma and show her this?
We don't give anything away unless it's someone's birthday.
If it's not a right angle, it is a wrong angle.
I know! I haven't even read them the specials yet!
Okay then, would you like to lie down on the table?
Oh no-no-no, he's just I don't know, he's just a little bookish.
Hi, darling. Where's my grandson, you didn't bring him?
Oh, there's tonnes of terrific stuff-I'll go with you!
Oh, I'm sorry. Lisa, Monica, Chandler. We used to date.
Hey, come dance. What? Are you married? 'Cause that's okay.
We're, we're just gonna get a little sip of water.
Not that old crow, my mother. Congratulations darling.
Right, okay, the one that lives in Montuak, umm-hmm.
Y'know, like where are we? Where is this relationship going?
Okay you two are asking the court for an annulment?
Well... I'll... just show you what I'm gonna do about it...
Peeeeeooooooooch "Hang up that phone!" One take!
Sure! Why not? You could be my sister for the day.
But, I was curious; do you have any plans for tonight?
I'll tell her that it's over tonight at dinner. I promise.
Okay, but that would actually be a big step down for me.
I'm sorry, why don't we do that right now? He's right here.
Well, I'm going to go into my new apartment now. Ehh!
Joey, I kinda have a lot to do today, what do you want?
Look at you in the apron. You look like you're in a play.
Uh Bing, I think we're gonna make this the last game.
What is this? Who put a twenty down here? Huh?
I'm not supposed to drink coffee, it makes me gassy.
Our last ocean view room was unacceptable to you.
Oh hi! Well, I guess that's two out of three, Joey.
Well, you just asked if I wanted to go to bed with you tonight.
Fonzie met Mork. Mork froze Fonzie.
I thought you were Chandler. But umm, one of who is over there.
Well, were gonna be layin off people in every department.
Can I have the next one please? Joey and Tony Tribbiani.
Okay, so...no toner today. Thanks anyway, bye-bye.
Hey, you're gettin' better. I'm gonna keep this by the way.
Yeah, it was my first date since the uh, since the divorce.
Oh my God! That's the doctor who was in my room before!
Here we go! Okay, keep pushing! Wait! I see something.
Have we talked about the possibility of multiple births?
Oh, blimey, I still can't believe you've got an earring!
Yeah, and neither did we. Give yourself a break.
So what about us? Everything we feel for each other.
I, I really have to be somewhere but it was nice meeting you.
Does it have melted cheese and marinara sauce?
I'm sorry, sorry. You're not supposed to say "long pause"
Yeah, the list that-of people we're allowed to sleep...
I bought a restaurant and I would like you to be the head chef.
Rachel, don't do this. This is just because you're turning thirty.
I'm Mackenzie. My stupid parents are selling this house.
This is so fun. This is like a reunion in the hall.
Think I better go before mommy starts weeping.
Hey Joey, could you uh, go through these lines with me?
I see him, you guys are just the worst hiders ever.
Not so good, Simmons and I gave him a wedgie.
That's a tomato. This one definitely goes in the display.
Oh yeah, but I can stay out as late as I want.
Oh also, you might be interested to know that I have a Ph.D.
No, I... I didn't mean the pen. Thank you for the book.
That's because I'm wearing a dress that accents my boobs.
Oh, why would he do this? I mean, what's wrong with me?
Come on, he's still in the bathroom! I'm begging you!
Joey, well thank you. That is so sweet. Oh, excuse me.
We can't scratch. You know we can't, we'll scar.
My friend Lewis told me you were giving out money.
You made him a candle light dinner in the park?
Why did you change it, Ella was so much prettier!
Oh, yeah. Oh, you know, that's too bad that didn't work out.
Hello everyone. So who am I saying hello too?
Oops! I did not mean to run into you like that sir.
And you tell him no one takes advantage of the Gellers.
I swear, whatever I was doing, I was always thinking of you.
Joey I can see you okay? You're hiding behind the coats.
Actually, I was kinda hoping it would be the other way around.
Hi, Joey. Well well, look what you brought. Very nice.
Last I heard, he was a pharmacist somewhere upstate.
I just had the greatest idea! I'm gonna come live with you!
Schnoodle. Oh my God, what the hell happened to my dog?
But if you wanna get married why didn't you say something before?
Why don't you get in the hot tub and I'll meet you there.
No thanks man, I'm not uh, I'm not really into sports.
I am so sorry I spilled wine all over your shirt.
Hard day huh? First the medical award, this.
Phoebe, we have rules here, this isn't that kind of place.
Yeah I.. I think so. It's nice to meet you Emma.
No. I went with, uh.. Now, this may hurt.
But that was after the wedding, it's not bad luck then.
Yeah, I-I considered that. I just know it would make me happy.
I am hurt! A plague on both your houses!
Knowing you're here, waiting for me I think it's kinda exciting.
Hey! The law says you have to accept any fare.
Sorry. We didn't hear you; we're on our honeymoon.
Oh! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Yes! Thank you!
Don't take that tone with me. All-all right you can.
Yeah, we loves 'em. I've never seen him with-
Nothing. Ok, everything. I think we're calling off the wedding.
Are you kidding me, I could stay and look at her forever.
And after that, what could I do except become a chef.
That's one way! Me, I- I went for the watch.
Okay. It's just like anything else, you just have to get used to it.
...emblem of the land I love. The home of....
Actually, I uh, I gotta get going. Give me a call sometime.
They're every four minutes and last 55 seconds.
He proposed to you? This is the worst birthday ever.
Please... go! Just let me know if you need a hand!
Listen Ross, you don't have to apologize. I understand why you were there.
Oh, yeah, they were so personal, really showed you cared.
Umm, that was really great, but I-I gotta take-off actually.
Cute assistant! What's his story? Is he...
The doctor will be here in a minute to do your sonogram.
Dating profile? I-I-I'm talking about the work resume.
Whattaya say we make these, uh, coffees Irish?
We found your fire alarm in the trash chute.
No it's not too soon, I had lunch at a eleven.
I left a Belgian waffle out here, did you take it?
I'm not a temp. I was transferred here from another department.
Let me get this straight man, you attacked your ex-wife?!
Oh, I have a friend who's a cop and he got it for me.
I'm sorry. I am such a doofus. I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.
Yeah well, thanks for bringing back what's left of him.
I'm sorry, I can't talk. I'm gonna go write in my journal.
All right, first thing we gotta do, damage control.
Connected? I mean.. to what? She's.. she's a lump.
In human terms, I'd say Cybill Shepard.
Here, monkey. Here, monkey! Here, monkey! Gotcha.
Start pushing. Here we go. Here come the shoulders...
Oops, I'm sorry. Excuse me. Is this the umm, the memorial?
All right! Let's try this again! You ready Joe?
Alright, Mommies, take a nice deep cleansing breath.
...what the hell does she want with half a boat...
Maybe if you just played some regular kiddie songs.
I still can't believe it! I'm the luckiest guy in the world!
Hey, so what'd I miss, what'd I miss, c'mon?
I mean, thats what this is all about, right? Ross? Ross?
We have it. Only now, we call it the beach house.
Please, stay on the line. Your call is important to us.
Clearly you've never been to Sandles Paradise Island.
And if I want to call for a reference on your last job?
It's just her water breaking. Calm down, will you?
Oh no. I feel it isn't really anybody's business, y'know.
I don't know. I don't know what I'm gonna do. I just- you decide.
Yeah, you can melt art. Hey, can I use your phone?
Then I go feel your friend up and make you mad at me.
I'm not sure yet. Why didn't you just tell me about all this?
Whoa! Hey-hey! What's going on here? Who is this guy?
There's a reset button under the plastic cover.
Hey Mon! Hey Chann! Just gettin' a soda!
Now, I want you to tell me what you're doing while you're doing it.
Wow, you look even... more beautiful than you did yesterday.
Everybody else got one, and you want one too. Don't you?
Yeah, I can talk them into giving you like, 30 dollars.
Oh, no thanks, I'm just waiting for, uh, Joey Tribbiani.
Oh. Oh I just cannot believe Clark stood me up!
Oh, sure, Valentine's is our busiest night of the year.
Sure. Sure. Second's up! Not...that kind of table.
N-no... uhm... did I buy a falafel from you yesterday?
I'm afraid, I'm not at liberty to divulge that information.
Yeah. We'd go to the science lab after hours!
Okay. And don't worry, I'm not just gonna take you out for donuts.
Absolutely! And when you do, make sure you ask for Brian.
The guy that's about to kick your ass talks like that.
"Alright, here, you want an answer... the answer... is..."
It was a simple mistake. It could happen to anyone.
Sweety, now, she's a woman, not a gumball machine.
I-I-I gotta go, I gotta go. Okay, not without a kiss.
Y'know what, I gotta go. And thank you so much for coming.
Oh no, don't be silly. I just bet I'd need these.
Okay I understand. I wouldn't want to be proved wrong either.
How could you know. Why wouldn't you punch me in the stomach?
Can't you figure that out based on my date of birth?
Well then I guess then I-I would I would have to say C.
Well, if that's what you want. I'll just put it all in my room.
I know. You're the guy who wouldn't chip in for the handyman.
You were so funny with that waiter! You're such a nut!
Well, goodbye Chandler. I had a great blackout. See ya.
Are you worried your date came, saw you, and left?
Oh, well just probably the worst one since I've been alive.
And we're dancing. A-five, six, seven, eight...
Hey lady. Hey wait up. How do you know my dad?
Is that why your hand is pressed against my crotch?
Well actually they're taping tomorrow. I don't really understand why.
Uh, actually I find Marion's views far to progressionist.
Great. Uhh, just tell her her husband stopped by.
Hi. Could I have a pack of Newport Lights, please?
Which one? Was it bald or was it tall?
Oh? Really? That's what my daughter means to you? Nothing?
Y'know what? It doesn't matter! Because it is not true!
Okay, it'll take just a little while to prepare the embryos.
Come on! You're just titling! Her legs are fine!
Well, I've changed your screensaver from that picture of *Nsync.
And someday soon, I hope to open my own restaurant.
MY SISTER'S GONNA HAVE MY BABY!!!!!!!
Touchet, touchet, Miss Americccan pie. Ameri-ccan.
Oh, you kids Well, this is the best party I've been to in years.
Nope. Uh, it's okay. It's just uh, God I hated her.
Russians! It showed them as terrorists and villains!
No one's ever thrown me a surprise party before!
Now, nooo! I'm just excited about the restaurant, that's all.
Umm, slight change of plans. We've shut down.
Hehehehey, isn't that the guy who used to wear your hat?
It's a nice watch, I don't wanna break it on your ribs.
I'm gonna marry Myron and keep looking for Mr Right.
Come on honey, let's go drink our body weight.
Dancing on your feet! Like the other girls did it.
Oh wow! That was amazing, was that really just an hour?!
Ah, yeah, umm. Home is never far away..
So um, is there a phone here, I can check my messages?
After a while it's like, shut your mouth, you know?
Jack, is it all our fault? Were we bad parents?
Oh no! Oh no! Oh no! Oh no! No! No! No!
Oh-kay, we'll have a table for you in about 45 minutes.
Ross! Ross! Come on! Get in here! Ross! Come on!
Joey, it's Anne Geddes. She's a famous artist.
Yeah. I can just go home and get back at him by myself.
Absolutely! Or maybe just a little less pimp spit.
Well, I couldn't have done it without you buddy. You're a genius.
Well, apparently I'm willing to offer her things that you are not.
Boy, somebody's gonna get a big fruit basket tomorrow.
'Cause the sweat's getting in my eyes and its burning.
I notice you picked out a lot of our dinosaur items.
You two could really hit it off! I'm gonna go mingle.
Oh no, stay here we'll keep doing this. I'll pay you.
I don't know anything about music, but I think you're really, really great.
Well, if you don't want to leave, why are we having this lunch?
Give me twenty seconds on the clock. Ready? Go!
Well, while you were on your baby vacation I was doing your job.
That's it? That's the giant number you were afraid to tell me?
Poppy. Oh, I'm gonna be a poppy. So when is the wedding?
Oh, that-that would be great. So you didn't even get to Italy?
I want a retraction! Our food is not inedible swill!
No, it's, it's more of a fifth date kinda revelation.
Well you should be. Screw it! Bring on the yams!
Huh? Really? -- Hm, that'd be so terrible?
Joe, I tried to wait until I was 25 like you did!
Why don't you like me! Chapter one: my first period.
....Mindy. Mindy, of course Mindy, it was always Mindy.
Oh no, I know that wouldn't work. My husband's in concert.
Well, maybe you and your baby should go to another strip club.
Okay, I don't need any toner because I'm going to kill myself.
I'd love to, but my lawyer said I can't do that anymore.
Hey, I'm trying to have a private conversation! Is that okay?!
Well, the delivery went out to you and I realized they forgot this.
My late husband gave me that lighter. I'm not kidding.
Oh wow, Ray-ray I have no idea what you're talking about.
What did I tell you about talking to your friends while you're working?
Terribly nice of you to offer to pay for half the wedding.
Look Phoebe, It's not about you. I just never wanna get married again.
They were so ornate and beautiful, I mean look at that!
No-no-no, do you uh light candles? Burn incense?
Well of course Ben, I meant my first granddaughter. Wow.
Yeah, what are they gonna say you didn't love me anymore. Come on.
Hey, dragon! Here's your tips from Monday and Tuesday.
Okay now I wouldn't date you because you seem a little creepy.
Uhm... Buenos dias, enchilada, por favor...
No shouting, but we still need a name for this little guy.
No no no no, it's potpourri. You're supposed to smell it.
Yeah! It's fine, it's fine. Robbie's gonna be here for hours.
Um, y'know, before we go ah, there's something I need to say.
Umm, it's a lollipop and a uh, a home pregnancy test.
Hi! Thank you so much for coming again. Did you like it tonight?
I'll give you store credit in the amount of four dollars.
Well, guess who my dad's making partner in his firm?
We're all beginners here. Nobody knows what they're doing.
Ahahaha... haha.. yes I can, of course. Excuse me.
Kinda stepped on the toes of what I was going to say.
Well I'm not gonna stop until I'm the Ultimate Fighting Champion.
Oh, so you're saying you'd choose convenience over health?!
Hi! I'm sorry, I know it's after hours but I really need candy.
'Days of Our Lives'! That's why you look so familiar!
Phoebe, these are our friends, Tom and Sue Angle.
Well, she was leaving work and she was hit by a cab.
All right. Well, y'know in my defense I was a lousy father.
Why do all you're coffee mugs have numbers on the bottom?
So you're asking us to refund your donation to the children?
Is it really your fa--I can't... well of course it is.
Right. Hey, ahh, you wanna come? Marge has a girlfriend.
your welcome again, I'm gonna make some coffee can I get you anything?
Next up is a marching band from Muskogee, OK.
Danny! Hurry up! The bath is getting cold!
You are no longer authorized to distribute birthday muffins.
Well, actually the last time you and I saw each other was that morning.
No. But it's okay, I'll just put out pickles or something.
Now, do you think it should say, "Love Ross and Mona?"
I...I uh, actually just moved from four blocks over.
Do you uh, want these things delivered Mr. and Mrs. Geller?
Well why not? So you can spend your time with this tramp?!
I think you'll like it, it has two out of the three tenors.
Oh, it's you. I see you everywhere. I'm Jim, Jim Nelson.
Well, we're starving, why don't we all go get something to eat?
You're no Brown Bird, I can see you through my peephole.
Flowers of Evil, by Beaudalire. Have you read it?
Oh, uh... we just uh... happen to wear the same shade.
Ooh. Ooh. But ya know what would be even sexier?
Dennis is a dear old friend and a fantastic lover.
Mmh... he does have a pretty serious latex fetish.
Oh umm, y'know I think it would be better if we just save it.
Y'know what Phoebe? This isn't really worth the free massage.
It seems your daughter and Richard are something of an item.
Boy, bad time to say the wrong name, huh Ross?
Why would you serve food on such a sharp stick?
Well, if I ever goto Minsk, you'd better watch out.
So, we're decided, no on plaid, yes on pink?
Soo, are we expecting the rest of our party shortly?
Hey Joey, hi! I'm Ray; I'm the producer of the show.
Dr. Farber, Bobby Rush is here for his adjustment.
I just wish Nana were alive to hear Ross's toast.
Umm uh, I'll make some coffee and we can uh, chat.
You wouldn't return my calls, you sent back my letters....
Oh, somebody's been doing his buns of steel video.
...and I was wondering if... you know, maybe one of you guys...
We got the grant. Three years, all expenses paid.
Peel the onion. First of all, he's good looking.
Calm down, we got time, we're running a little late.
Hi, I am Laura, I am here for your adoption interview.
So, it's Monica and Chandler. I only know you as file 0W33815-D.
Uhm, you're in your head. You-you're thinking way too much.
Yeah. Y'know, the hazelnut actually not a nut, it's a seed.
Sunshine is here! The sky is clear, the morning's here!
Look, you don't have to talk to it. You can sing to it if you want.
Certainly. Very well. And Dr. Geller, when is my birthday?
That's a good one! Do you hear that Ross? Three days!
Icky? You're actually gonna throw this away because it's icky?
So, okay! So you'll come with me on the Paris trip.
Hi, one, uh, mushroom, green pepper and onion?
I suppose it wouldn't be the end of the world... Oh, thank you!
No, but he did just win the McArthur genius grant.
Your face could be covered with lochs, I wouldn't care.
Rachel was just helping me out. My head got all sunburned.
Well hey, I wanna ask you about Monica's little "groomy" joke.
Here you go honey. One Diet Coke with ice.
No, you, you can't fit in that thing. That's not deep enough.
So you still think you, um... might want that fifth date?
See, if anyone overheard that, I didn't come off well.
I'm Gavin Mitchell, the person who's taken over your job.
Why is this happening to me?! I don't know, maybe it's my wound.
Oh umm, I-I don't know if I want to wear a woman's shirt.
Yeah. I have to sleep, have to, on this side of the bed.
It's not a game Ross, a woman died on my table today.
Great. Great! Just give me a sec to change film.
Well, if you want, I'll justI'll just break it off with her.
Hey, dinosaur guy, look at you, so sad. Come dance.
Put some pants on kid so I can kick your butt.
Well, I'd gotten Judy pregnant. I still don't know that happened.
Wow, you're a lot nicer on 'Days of Our Lives'.
Well, if you're one of Ross's best friends, why aren't you here?
You idiot, you stupid cowboy, you blinded me, I'm suing!
I'm sorry. If you wanna pretend that nothing happened, I can try.
Dahaaa! I'm going to find the men's room, be right back.
Guess what? Ben is going to be in a TV commercial!
Also, I've just been working on this big presentation for tomorrow.
OK, well then who was the kid that got caught masturbating?
Oh! It's Ross... Hey Ross! Hello-oo Ross! He's rude!
So last I heard you were gonna get married. Oh poor Ray-ray.
You can have your own office, and a raise! Effective tomorrow.
Oh it's great! It's great! Thank you so much for introducing us!
Well, that's sort of a given, but yes. Anyone else?
Oh good. Now there'll be someone there who likes my name.
Nope! I still can't believe she slept with you in the first place.
I always thought that too. Tell me, what does your father do?
He's not a hero. ...You know who our hero is.
I do love it, and I love your name. I love Princess Consuela.
1...2! Y'know what? You're young; you probably don't have glaucoma.
Hey Chandler, you can't keep your hands off her for one second!
Well, Phoebe's still pretty hung up on that Mike, uh?
Okay. So I'll come by in a couple hours and pick you up?
Umm, this may be a little weird, but I-I-I got a date here.
Elizabeth! Oh look, Elizabeth's here! Who are you talking to?
Well, there'll be women in bikinis holding up the scores.
And you promise you'll get this taken care of right away?
Well hi, I'm Jenny Boone. I'm the new teacher here.
3! 2! 1! HAPPY NEW YEAR!!
Oh shoot! Maybe next time. Thanks for a lovely evening.
So where's the young lady who I'm supposed to take downtown!
It says here that the knife went right through your shoe.
Y'know, there are two people who could put your picture up there.
Smelly cat, smelly cat, what are they feeding you?
Yeah, I guess. Look, what are we gonna do about this scene, huh?
So you're up for keynote speaker! Who's making the decisions?
So Rachel, your mom tells me you changed your major again.
Uh, I don't have a wife or girlfriend, but I do like to ski.
Well, any contribution, large or small, is always appreciated.
See the thing is umm, we're not able to y'know, uh, conceive.
Come on, you got the shopping bags and the Sack's catalog.
Please, clean my beakers. I don't get out of the lab much.
Wow umm, tell Sipowicz I'm real sorry for his loss.
See ya Phoebe! Oh and hey, thanks for chipping in!
Oh, I-I-I understand all that, but it's just-that was my puppy.
I was looking at stuffed animals, and Susan wanted a Chunky.
Kinda playing fast and loose with the word "interesting".
I feel pretty. Oh so pretty. I feel pretty and witty and...
hm-mmm... Mom said she gained like fifteen pounds.
So, I guess you and I should talk about Jack and Ben right now.
Okay, which one of you guys is Gunther Central-Perk? Hey, Joey?
Dr. Geller...? Charlie... What are you... what are you doing here?
Are you sure, because we may have something at Louis Vuitton.
So, you know... I have a little time. If you... if you want to...
Yeah well, at least now people will know she is a girl!
...and her yoga and her Bridges of Madison County...
Ooh, Jack.... Sometimes I forget how powerful you can be.
I just had the hardest day. Those bags are so heavy.
No, I umm, I read about her in Mom's suicide note.
Who is the father? Oh no! Please don't tell me it's her!
I don't know what to say, Benji. This is all so.... romantic.
Oh no! You get up there and do that again exactly like that!
Please stay on the line. You're call is very important to us.
Yeah... Well, when... you and I broke up I started seeing someone.
We took a road trip to Las Vegas man.
Hey! So what is this? Some kind of snake or something?
See that's just something I said now, so that maybe I could kiss you.
Oh my God. That sounds amazing. I would love to see pictures.
Oh hi, come on in. I'm Catherine, the listing agent.
Yeah, but you're back's a zero. You're gonna wanna even that out.
See? See? It was because you were looking fat pervert!
Wow you look so beautiful! If I knew you, I'd cry.
Hey, wait a second! So wait, what precinct are you with?
I... I know you're leaving tonight, but I just have to tell you. I love you.
Remember, Emma, heart disease kills women too!
When the Cretaceous period ended, the dinosaurs were gone.
Dr. Remore, report to first floor emergency, stat.
Oh, yeah, I don't like you this way. All right, I'll see you guys later.
Alright. Just give me your wallets and there won't be a problem.
And it didn't feel so girlie during the Gulf War.
Right now that seems so far away, seventeen years.
Oh, isn't it exciting, I mean it's like having a boyfriend for life.
Could you do me one favor, if it's not too much trouble?
Okay, so wait, all right, so how does that make things better?
Oooh, I gotta tell you... you are nothing like I thought you would be.
Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut...
Well, he may be now, because I think I hit him with my car.
I'm now thinking I would like to change my answer to, no one.
All right, everybody, I'm openin' the doors. You boys ready?
Oh no-no believe me, I'm leaving as soon as possible!
Well, she would take her keys and try to jam them...
Well, her favourite flower is the camellia. From the poem...
Y'know, that's-that's fine, but the line is, "Hmm, soup."
Yeah, we have time off and a lot of people are going on trips...
We're gonna have a big family, I've always wanted a big family!
Uh, like, could these margaritas be any stronger? Hey, Chandler.
Because it's in a slightly different time zone than the kitchen.
that is so wrong and on top of that his a glue sniffer.
No! You we're right, that was fun! I'm gonna go finish packing.
I'm sorry, you cannot go any further without a boarding pass.
Anyway, that's all I know. That, and this. This is the real him.
Oh, shoot, we gotta go, got a reservation in 30 minutes.
What's up? You're voice sounded all squeaky on the phone.
This is the final boarding call for Flight 664 to Yemen.
My friend Manny. I asked him to keep me away from you.
Ok if everyone's on board, it's settled, Chandler, Chandler?
Yeah, I know. I hate it too. Look, maybe we should just tell them.
Rachel, I need the Versachi invoice. Hello! You don't work for me.
I know! I almost called off my wedding. Oh, who's your band?!
This is Wayne, the man who created and operates C.H.E.E.S.E.
Really? Well, if you do, come in the spring. It's just lovely there.
Oh, no! This is work. I should call in. Can you excuse me?
And cut. Hey, Butt Guy, what the hell are you doing?
Hey, well, in a couple of weeks I won't be able to travel.
I don't think I'd be comfortable with any of my old lovers there.
I'm sorry, would you move your thumb? I can't see the seat number.
Oh, y'know what? Forget it, you already gave me an A.
That's fair... Although, can I ask... why do you think that is?
Where's my granddaughter? I've been practicing my magic tricks.
You must really like... Joey... to go to all that trouble for him.
We're on this bus, that's easily 200 years old...
You know what I keep wondering? Why you two are still sitting here.
Yeah! Hey, sure! The "Days of Our Lives" guy!
We already got the results back on that on, and they're not good.
Okay, he sees us. Now don't move. Don't look at him.
I-I gotta say, I-I-I-I'm not too sure I agree with that.
Wait, you're not 'G.Stephanopoulos?' Man, my dad's gonna kill me!
Well, I should hope not. Ross knows better than that by now.
What's the matter Dina? Don't you recognize your own mother?!
Okay, I've got some ugly friends, and they're all available too.
Y'know, I wore that cashmere sweater on a date last night.
Oh my God! I won! Do you have any idea what this means?!
Yeah, I understand, but before you do, she really needs to hear this.
Here, let me. Rachel Green's line, how may I help you?
Oh my. We're gonna need to take you straight to the delivery room.
Like an X-Ray. Bad day not to wear a bra.
No, it's been a long time since your dad and I went running.
Okay, so what you used to have with Rachel, is what I've got with Alice.
Oh, by the way, tomorrow we're auditioning for a Broadway show.
Yeah, well, it would've been, but uh, my parents just moved here.
Okay. Okay. Would, would it help if I went over and apologized?
Phoebe, why don't you come in the living room and meet our friends?
No, no, it's not like that. I, I work for a medical researcher.
Hey guys, I just uh, wanted to invite you to the party tomorrow night.
I could... but I won't. If I find that monkey, he's mine.
Okay, uh well, let's try one. Whenever you guys are ready.
I'll get it. Hello? Ross's place. Mike speaking. It's for you.
Where else would lame Mr. No Balls hide it?
Can you believe it. I've never had any professional dance training.
Top of act two. This is my entrance. You got it?
Well, I just wanted to see where you lived. Now, give me the tour.
...I just get this craving for Kung Pow Chicken.
Well, there was talk of shutting down Ralph Lauren all together.
Well, I used your boxes to divert water away from the Porsche.
No no no, no no no, neat, as in no rocks.
At one point near the end she deliberately defecated.....
Rachel, this is my friend Tom. This is the girl I told you about.
Are you kidding? My girlfriend doesn't know, I'm not gonna tell them!
It's a witness not a perp. And no one talks like that!
Oh, Ross, you gave a B to a Pottery Barn catalogue.
How could it be so much? The receptions at their house.
Listen Joey, we definitely want to see you for the callback on Saturday.
Yeah, it's here in the paperwork we got from the clinic in Ohio.
Yeah! And maybe someday we could get a place with two bathrooms.
Just...think about it. If you don't, I'll talk more about humping.
Yo, Chloe, do you have a quarter for the condom machine?
I'll feel better when I'm there, and I can know where you are all the time.
Oh, don't worry I have plenty of sun block, it's SPF-30.
And we've tried everything, we've seen a bunch of doctors.
This is where I get off. Well, I have your address and phone number.
Why don't we try massaging the breast to stimulate the flow.
Okaaay... so eh... so tell me, how did you guys meet.
Wow. What can I say? This doesn't make me like you any better!
So umm, you feel like taking a test? There's only one question.
You look strong, why don't I take that and you grab one of the boxes.
Okay. (Goes over and fluffs up the pillows on the couch.
I'll tell you what, Chandler, why don't you call me when you grow up!
Right. Well, on behalf of the children: thank you both very much.
Oh you're awesome! And, in that last speech? You soaked me.
Yes, well I was wrong, and I have to say you really impressed me today.
Good. Now imagine your vagina is opening like a flower.
All right. Well, there you go. Stop it, stop it, stop it.
Well, the-the three of us we were, kind of umm, a couple.
Oh, I missed you kids. Well, should I put my coat in the bedroom?
We get off around midnight, why don't we pick you up then?
Can't have?! Excuse me, the only thing I can't have is dairy!
Uh listen, I just-I thought you should know I broke up with Ursula.
I now find you shallow and um, a dork. All right, bye.
Well, this is fun. So Ross, did you kill any of these wives?
Because if you're not moving forward, y'know you're just moving backwards.
Yeah! Yeah, it's gonna be a small ceremony. Just family. His.
So anyway we really... Honey, we're just smoking all over you.
I'm gonna take off now. You're gonna let me go home, aren't you?
It's a filthy, disgusting habit and I want you to quit now!
Lipson knows. Do you have any idea who else knows?
"Hi, this is Richard. Please, leave a message at the tone."
This could be Gods way of telling us to eat at home.
Honey I made a reservation at China Garden, is that okay?
Oh, I'm so sorry I missed the ceremony, I was stuck at auditions.
You're right, I apologize. Scratch the last question. Spell "Boscodictiasaur".
Oh, I hate this but I-I-I have to go. I-I can't miss my flight.
You tell your friend Chandler that we're definately broken up this time.
There's something I never told you Amber. I'm actually your half- brother.
Ooh, duct tape. Was I supposed to bring something too?
Hey, pal, you have about three seconds to get away from my partner.
That's why I said all those things about your flirting and your drinking...
I'm sorry, I can't! I'm running a discussion group all afternoon.
Y'know, you look nothing like I would've thought. You're...you're so young.
They found rust. You know what rust does to a boat?
Well, if you like you can feel Rachel's and then feel mine to compare.
I'll call the university and tell them about your relationship and have you fired.
Well, I'm sorry. I just thought I'd try to make the place a little nicer.
... no... bu but there was my first boyfriend Billy.
Yeah, I'm sorry too. But, I gotta tell you, I am a little relieved.
For God's sake, will you let it go? There's no Rachel!
Okay, I hear you loud and clear. Bob will stay put.
Oh sure, we should see results-Whoa!! Clearly not the way to go!!
Ross, come on! Get in the bloody scrum! Ross, get in!
Well then why don't we see the bride and the groom and the bridemaids.
They already do. That's why they call it the 'tray spot.'
No. Thank you so much for coming in. We appreciate it, thank you.
So, what do you think of my daughter in the apron with the big job?
Oh no. I thought you said they could shoot the spot without you.
No, I would see you looking embarrassed because they are not on my desk!
Uh yes, I have these two rather beautiful $5 bills.
Well, you're practically dancing already. Why don't you just do it over here?
If you didn't pour the coffee, no one would have anything to drink.
Alright, here you go my friend. Eggs a-la Eddie, huh?
Well, you know, you have to take a course. Otherwise, they don't let you do it.
Eight o'clock is the cut-off and, aww, it's 8:02.
Well, Octavio, 27&7-Oh! And there's this great little place, Alessandro's.
Oh, ah, isn't there another professor that is supposed to come with us?
Well if you like, we can include your names in our newsletter.
Actually, I tried to call to you. You didn't need to come down here today.
I can hear you through the ceiling. My cats cant sleep.
And it is annoying when parents put their baby on the phone...
I'm sorry Amber. It's just like Brad to have to have the last word.
Uh, I'm a little embarrassed about calling you a hottie on my evaluation...
Y'know, it's funny, but when we were studying communicable diseases...
Oh no, but when it comes to love, what does age matter?
It wasn't on your list, but hopefully you'll think it's really fun.
Fine! Well then to quote Ross, "I'd better be going."
But I'm not gay. And I especially wouldn't want you to think I was gay.
It's allright! Crying is good. It lets the boo-hoos out.
Oh great! Is it vegetarian, 'cause Susan doesn't eat meat.
Oh, that's real pretty. Wait a minute, don't I get to see the bedroom?
No, no. She's fair game if you ask me, sorry buddy!
What is the great tragedy here? You go get yourself another appointment.
No. But God, a house made of cheese, wouldn't that be incredible?!
No. What ever happened to that little dude. So full of dreams...
Uh, Phoebe, I don't think your mom would want you to see what's about to happen.
Oh no-no-no-no, being adored. I'm used to it, don't worry about it.
Push. Push. Come on push for five seconds. 5...4...
There's nothing to discuss. We're not paying for your wine cellar.
Well, I guess having Rachel back wouldn't be the worst thing in the world.
Oh, I cannot believe he's using our divorce to sell mattresses.
With them, under them, what's the difference? Eh, Rach?
Rachel's coming up the path. Doesn't she look pretty. Jack...
Giving you my baby? You think I'd give you my child after this?
I'm just me, my wife died shortly after Lizzie was born.
Oh, scotch neat. Ya know, that's Rachel's father's drink.
Y'know what? I may regret this but uh, I'm going to give you a shot.
I can't believe you didn't know it's twins! This has never happened before.
Well maybe you can cut me some slack. I'm sort of in love.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I tried to stop, but I couldn't. I'm so pathetic.
Sorry, I just saw Ursula. I had to give the engagement ring back.
And if you see Rita Moreno, let her know I'm looking for her.
Yeah! I'm just going down there to relax and hang out with my friends.
Son, I had to shave my ears for tonight. You can do this.
Yeah! Actually Joey and I are going to the movies tonight, wanna come?
Well, at least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar...
Only because my parents wanted me to be, I wanted to be a sherrif.
Yeah, I got a big box of family stuff when my mom died.
Hi. Wait, no! Just put the mail down. It's-it's me!
Wow. Oh, I am really flattered, but I just I don't feel that way about you.
All you need is a woman who likes men and you'll be set.
And what's the one kind of boat that can never, ever sink?
Well what is it? Come on sweetie, your like, freaking me out here.
You know, I rarely connect with someone this much on the first date.
Oh no, no-no-no, is he ah, married, or involved with anyone?
Oh, you're losin' your apron here, let me get it. There you go.
I brought something that I want to give you, assuming of course that you want it.
Hang on a second. I'll-I'll talk to you in the morning. I'm sorry what?
Well, for one, he was talking about paintings that were nowhere around.
Yeah? Listen closely, Devon has got a weak ankle.
Well I'm gonna be on it this year. I'm gonna be one of the party people.
After what he just said, you're paying for the whole bloody lot.
No, I mean it. There are so few genuinely nice guys out there.
That's good, that's good. So, so, so who broke up with who?
They have a game room downstairs! Ping pong and stuff.
Maybe he's intimated by really smart, strong, successful women.
Oh, wow! You remembered! Oh! It's a Judy Jetson thermos!
Ooh, I don't know. Probably the smell of freshly cut grass.
No! No! It's just that, my dad never did. I miss my dad.
Yeah. Yeah, I'm sorry. I don't . . . I don't really like to talk about it.
Why do you even care if I was looking at her? Are you jealous?
I thought it was ok when you slept with your old assistant Tag.
Good morning. Drake, it's your brother Stryker. Can you hear me?
Hi! My boss let me off early, so I took the train.
So you work at Bloomingdale's, huh? My mom calls it Bloomies.
She's nice, huh? To think I almost brought my wife to this!
What are you going to do? Kill him? Like you did with Charles?!
Oh but then, they went and dropped you down that elevator shaft.
I can't say I care too much for that smell you've brought in with you.
Well, the biggest news is still you dumping Barry at the altar!
It's too late, all we can do now is sow up the wound.
You've sung Happy Birthday to 20 different women today!
I didn't even have a chance to act as though I'm okay with it!
Mr Campbell's not here yet. Let me show you to his table.
Here, sweetie, here. I took these when I had my golfing accident.
Well, welcome to the Winner Circle. Joey and Gene, you guys ready?
This is my father, Paul Stevens. Dad, this is Ross Geller.
Oh, I love them. Each one's like a little party in my uterus.
Do you want to ride around town on my little pink bicycle?
Oh my God! Someone, he's choking. Is anyone here a doctor?
Okay. I'll give you one chance to change my mind. You got one minute.
Well, then if there's nothing else, then the two of us should talk.
Oh, we were so sorry to hear about your parents splitting up, dear.
Look umm Joey, I-I don't think you're quite right for this project.
Hi, it's Eric. From the Halloween party, Ursula's fiance.
Sir? Sir? Excuse me, sir? Uh... I have a message for you.
Seriously? Its.. its just these rooms? I thought you were a doctor.
Sure! Monica, I can't get over how great you look! You look stunning!
Tartlets. Tartlets. Tartlets. The word has lost all meaning.
Yeah, most of the damage is pretty mostly contained in the bedrooms.
I don't want to see you lose a chunk of that pretty blond hair!
I must say this apartment, its, its, There are no words...
Well, I need a whole new wardrobe. My wife, well my ex-wife...
And the man who made all this possible... Mr. Peter Becker.
Classic Ross. Rachel, Rachel, oh how you glow. May I?
Take as long as you want. Just let me know when you're through.
I have no idea. Did you know Richard has a twinkie in the city?
Well okay, I'll swing by later. Do you live in this building?
What? The father can't drop by to see the daughter on her birthday?
Well okay, if it means that much to you, then I'll ask him out.
Im gonna wait till after we order. Its her, right.
Yeah, I'm movin' to a bigger place. You should definitely take this one.
Oh good, you're here. Yeah, and I was worried that it was going to be uncomfortable.
No-no-no, that was all true. This was just in case you pulled a Monica.
For what dear? For not inviting me or lying about it?
Ohh, listen. I've got to get going. Today was great, thanks!
Come on, let's have some fun. Huh? What do you want to do today?
Don't get up Jack! The safety pins are about to blow.
Actually she's my-my boss. Sous is French for under.
Me too! I'm sorry that guy in the subway licked your neck.
An Italian Catholic immigrant at this time would not be...
Seafood platter for the gentleman and extra fries. Enjoy!
Joe! I'm glad I found ya, I got an audition for ya!
Uh, the guy was Lou Gehrig. Didn't you kinda see it coming?
The guys across the hall are throwing water balloons at us.
So, I think you're ready to sell toner, do you have any last questions?
Excuse me, I-I couldn't help overhearing, you're marrying Chandler Bing?
Oh, I still do. Next year, I hope to make varsity though.
Well, I really wanted to meet you guys, but I have to run. I'll see you later?
Thanks. Hey, listen, would you like to go to a movie sometime or something?
That's fine, for now we'll just call her Baby Girl Green.
You've done all you can Dr. Wesley. You have got to let her go.
Please, make yourself comfortable and I will back in a moment with Erica.
Hey! You're in a play! I didn't know you could dance! You had a beard!
Yeah, well you'd be better if you just loosened your hips a little.
Yeah, but I kinda don't have a choice, it's my job. I mean, you understand right?
Oh. Well, I'll right you everyday. 15 Yemen Road, Yemen.
Yeah, well, sorry, Joe. You said let's just be friends, so guess what?
Let's see what we got here. Ohh, y'know, Fonzie dated triplets.
So Jack, you ever think about trading me in for a younger model?
Like when you go bowling and you know you're in somebody else's shoes?
Yeah, I don't know why, I'm sorry, I guess I just didn't want to lose face.
I think my character's gonna need a little bit more of reason than that.
I'm also allergic to peanuts, and cashews, and almonds, and filberts...
Pretty much, most of the time. We have a kind of... radar.
All right, all right, I'm coming over, and I'm bringing Chinese food.
Yes! I have it right here. Would you like to try it on Ms. Waltham?
Well, excuse me for putting a good spin on a traffic jam!
"I'd like to go for a walk", uhm "scratch my belly".
You're not going to say anything? On our 35th wedding anniversary?
Oh, that's great. I'm stalking the wrong woman. I am such a dingus!
That's not a good idea, that's kinda the reason the last guy got fired.
Joey says you don't really like his hat, but I think it's kinda dashing.
Hi! Gavin! Please to meet you. It was my idea to stand there.
That was a great lecture today. Did you get a little hair cut?
It's nothing, it's just that now your Father owes me five dollars.
Well let me ask you a question. Am I the Ultimate Fighting Champion?
Ladies and gentlemen please welcome the incomparable Helena Handbasket!
Oh, you know what? This is nothing. My father is a raging alcoholic.
I don't think so. Let's take it back to Richard's last line. Action!
...and after you've delivered the drinks, you take the empty tray....
Phoebe, Phoebe relax, it's okay. I mean we never said this was exclusive.
Well, it's not out here. Is there any chance it could be in your office?
I had to cut my hair to get rid of the uh, fogger smell.
I don't know, I mean, y'know, this is the city y'know, I just, I mean, I don't know.
Ahh, that's what your Grandmother's hands looked like when we found her.
You know what? Ever since I got here, you have been nothing but negative.
Sure, listen I was gonna order some pizza, you wanna share one?
Primarily in the Pierre Shale region of South Dakota.
Yeah, well, I had a great time with you.. I just can't stand your friends.
There is a man behind your curtain. I have a mace in my purse.
Joey, look at me, look at me. Do I have lipstick on my teeth?
I-I-I saw you on stage talking to that beautiful woman, y'know Sarah?
Hi, Phoebe! We were just at the drugstore and we got you a little present.
Me too. You know what? I just realised something. I don't wanna go home.
No! Y'know what Rachel? You're right, y'know he has been really nice to me.
Here, Ross, take our picture. Smile! You're on Janice Camera!
Rachel!! Open up!! It's your sister!! I have to talk to you!!
Oh I'm afraid that plane has already pulled away from the gate.
But um, we just refer to you as Bobo the Sperm Guy.
Could you tell Jasmine that I won't make it to yoga class today?
Well, that's up to Mr. Zelner. I'm sure he will make the right decision.
Yeah, drop it! Drop the towel! Please drop the wowww.
Well, after eight years of research I discovered that it can't be done.
Oh yeah yeah, thank God you were here to oversee all the kissing!
Oh, shut up. You know, it's a rebuilding year. You... waah!
Well, you said that we except the Discover Card, which we do not!
No, the line is pick a bag, so you need to pick up the bag.
Rachel, ready or not, here comes your knight in shining-Oh no.
Well ah, I've been doing a lot of thinking, and I look at my life...
Ohh, God, guys, check it out, you can see that girl's underwear!
You, you gotta be kidding. See, h-he, he can't act. .
Woah, woah, woah, what're, what're you talkin' about man.
Come on over the years none of you ever y'know, got drunk and stupid.
But then I'd have to go all the way around the dry cleaner place.
What do you got down there, Vic? What do you got under that tarp?
Change of plans, I made you a special Valentine's dinner! Surprise!
I do. I do. I love it. In fact, I think I'm gonna wear it home.
Well, it was quite large. I-I-I-I-I had to throw most of it away.
This is the last call for Flight 1066 to Athens. The last call.
Alright, but after this I want to see you outside. If the rain stops.
I think I will be all right! You wanna volley a bit for a serve?
Yeah, just, I feel like I'm about a hundred. I thought I was just one of the guys.
It's just so weird, two people look so much alike, and so different.
Reverend, can I ask? Does the bible say anything about adoption?
I think I may be able to book The Plaza on short notice.
Joey, Joey, I-I-I'll g-get you your job back if you help me out.
Relax. It's just Issac's D.J.-ing at the Philly. You should come.
Okay, here he comes. What is he doing? What the hell is he doing?!
Well thank you, I'll give you a tour later. It's actually three floors.
Ohh! Yes of course, thank you, thank you, thank you so very much.
Bye-bye. Oh uh, by the way, the answer is, the Brazil nut.
I can't believe she's really gone. Look around you, all of this is ours.
I think we'd better start again. Ross, repeat after me. I, Ross...
Ella wanted to go out, so we went shopping and got some sushi.
So, which one of you lovely ladies am I going to take to dinner huh?
I'll always remember that summer, because it's when I got all of these freckles.
Y'know, I-I-I just...I don't want to get in the middle of something so complicated.
Hi! Look! I got our pictures developed from Rockefeller Center.
Joey, hang on for a second. Lennart, can we talk to you for a moment?
Oh, look, here's Barry. Did he have to come straight from the office?
Ross umm, there's something that I've got to tell you, there's-there's someone else.
C'mon now Phoe, don't still be mad at me. How's it going?
Alright, that is not your father, that's just a picture of a guy in a frame.
But now I know I don't have a choice about this, I was born this way.
Hi, you're Chandler Bing, right? I'm Tom Gordon, I was in your class.
Ross, I'm only ringing to say stop harassing my relatives. Good-bye!
Wow! Wow, thanks a lot! I just wanna say, I think you're really talented.
..you add a pinch of saffron, it makes all the difference.
Wasn't Nick funny when he couldn't get his match lit?
No! You're clogging up the chute that I spent a half-hour unclogging!
Excuse me. Is this where the singing lady is that tells the truth?
Okay, yeah. I mean... If that's, if that's really what you want, okay.
Uuh, before we get into any staying-over-stuff, there is something you should know.
Of course, course one of 'em's Ma. What's the matter with you.
Don't you have a little too much penis to be wearing a dress like that?
Please, take the check, go have a great wedding and a wonderful life together.
Oh, because I was thinking, the semester's over; you're not my teacher anymore.
Ooh, yeah! She said she's having sooo much fun with Emily.
Ahh, I'm afraid I have some bad news. Marcel has passed on.
The Velveteen Rabbit. I kinda have the feeling you had something to do with it.
Yeah that would be great! Let me make sure I'm not doing anything Tuesday.
Oh, I'll-I'll be fine. Just God I hate her Ross! I hate her!
No, it's Sam Waterston! Crimes and Misdemeanors, Capricorn One.
Why don't we have Monica step away and we'll get Chandler and the bridemaids.
Actually I did it Ross. You remembered shockingly little of your own speech.
Sophie, get in here! You see! Now you're making Sophie uncomfortable!
Oh my god, there's an unattractive nude man playing the cello.
Why doesn't my key work and what's all my stuff doin' downstairs?
He told me! And he paid me 50 dollars not to tell.
This is a nice resume. Nice, nice, nice. Muy impressivo.
Well, yes, and now. Yes I did say it, and no, I didn't not say it.
Me? I'm fine, fine. I'm glad you're here. ...What's with your hair?
Oh. Oh my God. How can this be happening? What are we going to do?
Thanks so much for taking me to all those places. I had a great time.
Um, we should go too, I got patients at 8 in the moring.
Maybe. But that doesnt explain why they keep taking my scissors.
He picked it out of the toy store himself, he loves it.
Oh, this should be easy. I have a very wide pelvis. You remember Chandler.
No, it's about all women. Well, all American women. You feel better now?
So, here's somebody interesting, Joey. What do you know about Van Gogh?
So, these will match the jacket you picked out for me last week?
And if that person is already in your life, you should do something about it right?
All right, I need a clamp, sterile towel, and channel 31.
Oh no, it isn't! No! I think Barry is seeing someone in the city.
Well I mean, you're American to start with. You don't even have rugby here.
There's just one thing. Do you have a problem with full frontal nudity?
So you knocked her up but you're not gonna marry her. Dude! Anybody?
Ahh, thanks but no. You see I-I think I'm ready to dance with girls.
Y'know, it's a shame, because you and Lowell would've made a great couple.
Phoebe? Mike's ex-girlfriend Phoebe, the love of his life? That Phoebe?
I'll never understand you lesbians. So baby, tell me...what is new with you.
Well they said I should bring someone. Do you wanna be my dance partner?
This is where Ross and I are meeting for our date. So, what do you think?
Wow! I had no idea! But you know, I could always find another masseuse.
And-and then I sneak out and before Monica can her parents come in.
I guess I'm saying, I'll try and quit. I kinda like that you worry about me.
Oh, it's just... It's up to you. It's your name. You've got to live with it.
Well, there's my favorite client. So tell me darling, how was the audition?
So when people complement me on my cooking should I, what do I say?
Well I'm gonna have to put on a new lock, they'll find out anyway.
Buffay, are you going to plunge your stake into my dark places?
I invested in this night-club and it's opening tonight, would you like to come?
Hey-hey! Bing? Was that Bob from six you were just talking too?
Oh, and he's got such a good heart! Doesn't he have a good heart?
Wow! It looks like you were very generous with your grades this semester!
Oh, ow! Did Joey tell you to say that? You guys, are too much!
Yeah well, being that he was the victim, they're usually pretty talkative.
Look, the only who stands to get hurt is me. And I'm okay with that.
There are no hardware stores open past midnight in the Village.
Well, if I had told you, then it wouldn't have been surprise, now would it?
Well I don't mind, I'll cancel. I would never miss my secretary's birthday.
If you say yes then I'm serious, if you say no then I'm joking!
Yes. We're very popular. There's a two-year waiting list. Sorry!
Hi, Dean Lipson, zoo administrator. I was told you had a question.
You know, whatever we pick, she would've told us it's the wrong one.
So don't do it, it's fine. You don't have to do it just because Susan does it.
He musta been sweepin'. They found a broom in his hand.
Well, I've... I've been blessed with a... a lot of great roles.
I see. Well, I wish you both a lifetime of happiness. So you're bald?
Ohh forget it. Too hell with tradition, we're happy to do it.
No, the place is not open 'till Tuesday. Am I not saying it right.
Oh yeah? Well maybe you and I should take a walk through a bad neighborhood.
But um, here's an idea, have you ever worn women's underwear?
Yeah, you know, put chips in it, we'll make like a chip chick.
I don't know if you heard about what happened between me and Phoebe the other day_
Okay, I should, I should probably be getting back to my thing now. See ya.
No, it's just... I was enganged to a guy who turned out to be gay!
Anyway, I was wondering if, you were the sort of person who...eats lunch.
Well, if moving here is gonna make them happy, don't you want them to do it?
Why?! Why?! He said he'd call. Why hasn't he called?
Oh, okay. Well, I'll just leave the door open and go sit on the couch.
Hello? Yeah, um. Hang on one sec. Can I take this upstairs?
Ross? Ross! Wake up! Ross! Ross! Ross!! Ross!!! Ross!!!!
No, Gary Collins is the host. You'll be answering the phones.
I hate to be the one to say it, but honey you two are on your own.
Ok, unless you're not gonna try to get me to join a cult are you?
Chloe, switch with me, there's some guys here that got a crush on you.
I wonder if its time for you to rejoin our team at the museum?
That's cool. But... but if you do, I'm gonna need three days notice.
Because you've worked really hard, and it's your job, and you're a little crazy.
Oh, you're busy, that's ok, I'll get it. Anybody else want one?
Ow!-Ow!-Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Y'know, ow!
There may have been a-a joke or a limerick of some kind.
You could not be more wrong. You could try... but you would not be successful.
On behalf of the Children of New York, I reject your money.
I'm not gonna tell you! You're the bad man who broke Sarah's leg.
What do you mean? Yesterday you said I was too pretty to pay for stuff!
I usually prefer Elizabeth's boyfriends to address me as Mr. Stevens.
Now if you just pay me my three hundred dollars, I'll be on my way!
Ooh, that accident must have been terrible. You look positively ghastly.
Well, the director thinks you're really right for the part and wants to meet you tomorrow.
But, we can't go now. It looks like Rachel's gonna put on a skit.
I'm fine! And, I got you a present for letting me stay with you. Ready?
Well, it's getting late, I've got to get to the game, so I'm gonna... head.
Yeah, yeah, let me show you around. This is the uh, downstairs living room.
I crushed a pill and put it in her drink... Come on, sweetheart.
Oh please! It was such a big class! You never even noticed me!
Wow, so your child is a big fan of the Waldo books too?
I'm going to keep dating him Mother, and there's nothing you can do about it!
Excuse me, sir! This lady played my quarter, this is my money.
Wow, I didn't know they let you keep chickens and ducks as pets.
Wa-wa-wa-wait! Congratulations! You did it! You did it! You can relax now. Yeah.
Because you don't want me to be happy. You.. you have always been jealous of me.
I don't know... You know what? I'm gonna put you on with my bear. Hold on.
I'm sorry. Look, I know this can't bring him back but here, it's just a gesture.
The girl who won last year sold four hundred and seventy-five.
Drake, I've discovered the reason for all your headaches and memory loss.
Thanks so much for meetin' with me. Joey's told me so much about you!
Now, let me explain how this works. You go into the booth, and...
No, I try to save that for real awards. Now, if you'll excuse me.
I just came up to say, "Hi!" Hi! And you, sweetie, I'll see you tonight.
Look how nervous he gets! We haven't slept together in years!
Wait. You're right. I know you're right. And, thanks for being so nice. Here
And in the meantime you better let him drive. Does he have a license?

"Hi Joey, it's Jane Rogers can't wait for your party tonight"
Excuse me, hi. I was hoping I would run into you. Can we talk?
Oh, isn't a shame when one girl ruins it for the whole bunch?
...Hey! You're in a play! I didn't know you could dance! You had a beard!
God, this was really fun! I've been wondering if you were going to ask me out.
Oh, I don't know, she's pretty tired, too, I think we've got her onboard.
Oh yes! You're an excellent chef! As a person you're a little...
Cut! That was good. That was very good. You did everything I asked for.
Yeah, look, and I don't want you to feel like you have to give me your key just because...
No. No, haven't seen a monkey. Do you know anything about fixing radiators?
Okay, how about when you're not working. What do you do in your spare time?
No, no, no, you're doing fine, really... Why don't you go talk to my dad?
All right, enough! I don't want to hear about it anymore! Good luck, Chandler.
Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday dear ...

Ow. Um, it's just my lens. It's just my lens. I'll be right back.
Oh, time's up! Joey! You were, uh, almost on a roll there...
Let's get started. Five, six, a-five six seven eight...
Well, I think he's a little out there, but he does have some interesting ideas...
So what if it was? I thought there was nothing going on between you two...
This poor guy's been in a coma for five years. It's hopeless.
I've probably been talking too much. Why don't we talk about you a little bit?
Mmmmmm... Oh, Joey, Joey, Joey... I think I blacked out there for a minute!
Tasty! I'm really starting to feel like you guys have a history, it's-it's nice.
Hello, there. I'm Dr. Carlin. I see someone's having an allergic reaction.
Oh, Jack look, there's that house paint commercial that cracks you up.
My marriage like just ended, and I'm really not ready to get into anything yet.
If you're a professional chef, what are you doing taking Introduction to Cooking?
Me go out with Ross?! No! God no! What would make you think that?
No! Thank you! Monica, and Ross! I don't know what I'm gonna do about the two of you!
Yeah? Well, there's a lot of things Carol never did before I came along.
