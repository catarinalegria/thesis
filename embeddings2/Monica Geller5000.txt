I can't believe you bought this.
That's how old you are.
You'd better run!
Son of a bitch!
Thank you. They're yours.
How-how did that happen?
Did she really say that?
What? It's still going on.
No, I just talked to them.
How's it going with her?
Joey, speed it up!
So I'm kissing everyone?
I paid to have this done.
Well what did you send?
Why do I have to decide?
I'm not your best friend?
Guys, what's going on?
You didn't know that already?
This doesn't feel weird!
Is it a good play?
Just waiting for you sweetie.
Why is everything different?
These are for Erica!
Here, let me try.
Well, it matters to me!
No, not here. Maybe here.
What are you supposed to be?
Alright, alright, alright...
I mean really, think about it.
You said that was sexy!
Who's Mr. Girabaldi?
I'm gonna miss you so much.
Phoebe! Phoebe, open up!
I'm getting married next!!
That's insurance fraud.
Why don't you just call her?
What is the worse part?
So, how'd it go?
Yeah, well, is that better?
Okay, here's your penis!
So what'd he say?
Well you should be embarrassed.
Okay, umm, you're a loon.
We won't. 300?
Ross didn't scare you?
Oh no no no no!
But my clothes are-ohh!
So do them for free.
But we can go, right?
Oh no! What's the matter?
Just subtract twelve.
Everybody get your toys!
What the hell are you doing?!
He took my snack!
I thought she just had one.
Ooh, this always happens.
You're a really good kisser.
Did you just flick me?
Hey, it's good to see you!
Okay. Ow!!!!! Ow-oh-oh!
How who wears it?
That can't be your father.
Ah, the other Jack.
Hey! Did you find them?
Joey's bare ass!
Oh, god help us.
Oh, here's a great one.
You have dinosaur checks?
Happy New Year.
Aww, honey I'm sorry.
Chandler, why would you do that?
Rachel locked the door.
Put your head back.
What are you guys doing here?
No. I hate this part.
In...in two weeks.
Wow! You are really fast!
Fine! Happy Anniversary!
It's so good, isn't it?
Hey! You're wearing pants!
What are you trying on now?
Hey! So what do you think?
Hey, let me tell them!
Jeez! What is with you?
Alright, I'll be right back.
The thing we never do.
Hello, Mr. Heckles.
Let's go big bunny!
But we love our house.
I mean don't you trust her?
Wait, you like them with me.
Do you wanna go hunting?
How do you know a mugger?
Not at these prices.
Who are you talking too?
One Two Three...
That sounds like Nana.
All right, check me out.
No, here's your mail.
The best man? Wow!
Well, maybe you don't need them.
No. See you don't understand.
Oh no-no-no, it's still me.
Well, bye for me too.
All right, what's going on?
I'm changing out of this.
Yeah, I'd really like to.
We only ordered one!
Regular or decaf?
No that's, that's okay.
Clearly we were wrong.
Joey, you have to talk to her!
Oh my God! That's wild!
Well, apparently she does.
There were only twelve.
Who's David Lynn?
Come on, no peeking!
Bye sweetie, I love you.
OK, um. Goodbye.
Yeah, that's a big step.
It's clearly an Emma.
Yes! Have you seen it?
Y'know what, I like Kathy.
I am, aren't I?
Yeah. Don't do the dance.
Chandler, sense the tone!!
Pheebs, how's it going?
Oh no, we can't walk!
Oh my God, that's Charlie!
I'm so glad you liked it.
Can I ask you a question?
They hurt so much!
This is all of your things.
We were playing a game.
...What did I ask?
I wanna wear this everyday.
So, are you ready to go?
We're switching rooms.
You didn't hear the speech!
Phoebe, you are a bad ass!
I don't feel good right now.
Phoebe, it's not about quantity.
No really, they're OK.
And he's a great brother!
Then why are you laughing?
Now, open your eyes.
It's Chandler! Are you OK?
They've arrested Monica.
Yeah, but without the costumes.
Barry who you almost...?
Why did you hire me?
Chandler! What are you doing here?
Well, what about his family?
I'm engaged!!!!!! I'm engaged!!!!
Well, thanks, we like him.
Who the hell are you?!
Hi, nice to meet you!
What's wrong with PBS?
It's very interesting, Phoebe.
I am not high maintenance!
Who, who are they?
Worked like a charm.
I thought that was a good thing.
Let's get the show on it!
Okay, what's going on with you?
Well, I was having a conversation.
When were we not friends?
Well, I hope you're happy!
Gotta keep squishing.
You did a minute ago!
Was it really that good?
I would love to do it together!
Well you did a little bit.
What's with all this sand?
And that's Pete's Mom.
Um, Pennsylvania Dutch.
About nineteen pounds.
Ugh, I thought you were Rachel!
Wh-wh-what are you doing here?
That's not 'til Thursday.
I'm not gonna go out with him.
It's hard for some people!
No-no, don't-don't-don't do it!
Yeah? The work problem?
Phoebe, where's your purse?
Well, you're not working either.
Ross, thats my jacket.
Oh yeah, what's the plan?
Y'know what? You are right?!
I got you the foot massager.
Does anybody want these?
That doesn't seem fair.
I can't believe you didn't tell me.
We're with you. We got it.
Thunder being stolen!!
It's Monica, open up!
Y'know maybe a little bit!
Look at you with all the guys!
And Rachel. And that's Chandler.
Yeah! She's right in there!
Alright, 5 more minutes.
Hello. Oh, hey Ross!
How did you get in there?!
Chandler, why are you doing this?
Hey, Rach, how was work?
Hell, I wanna see Joey.
I can't believe it! I lost!
I...I have to fire him.
What else did you think about?
Oh, wait a minute honey.
So how does it look?
Yeah, I'm sorry. I really am.
Now calm down Joey.
I'll pick it up for you!
It's almost our anniversary!
Then why are you smoking?
Ow. Ow. Ow.
Look at you. All jealous.
Come on Rach, let's go.
The good stuff, huh?
Oh, now you want a pad.
Hey Phoebe! Guess what?
This is my favorite part.
He is right, isn't he?
You kissed another woman!
How about Mockolate mousse?
No, just a Friday night.
Hey, you've got a boyfriend!
Oh, none for me. Thanks.
Alright, you wanna feel better?
Well actually, Ross doesn't.
There's the man I married!!
Wow! You made a profit!
Is it the Italian guy?
How was your first day?
What is wrong with you?!!!
I never stop thinking about it.
You want some help with that?
Well, she saw the ring.
Never done that before.
Oh, I'm- I'm so sorry!
Yes, he is. Me.
You don't know military time?
Oh my God. Richard? Hi!
It's for their own good.
You can, I know you can!
I do not have baby fever!
Joey, we have something to tell you.
Awww. But still no.
Yes, you're having a boy!
No Phoebe I am mad!
I know. Closing credits.
His indian name?
Hi, glad you could come.
And who pays for that?
So, did I hear Poconos?
Rachel said everything was okay.
Well, I-I-I-I... I don't know...
I highly doubt that.
Two thousand dollars?
Yes! Okay! Okay! Wait-wait-wait!
From here to the airport?
All right? What's going on?
You really think that'll work?
Because then I don't have to!
Yeah! I bet I can do it.
Joey?! Oh my God, Rachel!
Y'know, just be there for her.
Oh man! I did it again!
Hi Pheebs, what's up?
She stole my jeans!
See he's nice. Right?
Oh well, it's not so bad.
Honey! Dinner's ready!
Why? Because of the government.
Oh my God, you're a freak.
Okay, it's ready. Come on.
Here's your tea Phoebe.
Here, let me help you.
That was gonna be my opener.
So, you're ready to do this?
I'm sorry, my friend Phoebe...
This totally makes sense!
Oh my God, this is horrible!
How about fifty bucks?
What are you doing with those?!
Yeah. That-that was the problem.
Oh, did you catch him?!
Yes that would be lovely.
What!? You faked it?
Are you serious? Oh my God.
Oh yeah, I totally agree.
Did she leave a number?
Yeah, he's gonna work on that.
That's what you say about porn.
Wanna give me a hand?
Best out of three?
Really, is he a swimmer?
Is Amanda here yet?
Alright, here you go, sweetie.
You stole them from me!
This isn't even my dress.
Sure, I love this part!
Well, we certainly are alone.
Hey, aren't you up next?
I so wanna be attracted to you.
That would be a good idea.
What are you smiling at?
He's gonna eat the cake!
She will be after tonight.
Okay, hold on a sec.
If you want, I'll do it.
Honey, you gotta talk to her.
His dancing partner?!
All right, so what do you say?
So you had fun, huh?
Well then get it, get it!
You realize what you are don't you?
I don't know what else to say.
Would you like something to drink?
What the hell are you cooking!
He's retiling my floor.
How'd you pay for them?
Maybe this wasn't your shot.
We are not going to whistle.
We'll be waiting for you...
Just uh, do the right thing.
Hi, Chandler. There you are.
You wanted it to be a surprise.
That I was going to eat him.
Then why did you move?!
Well, don't 'cha wanna?
Let me ask you a question.
That is sooo not true!
In case it happens.
Why don't you just get a roommate?
Alright, who wants to do it?
Ok, um, I'll go with you.
Oh, there's banana on it.
How desperate am I?
And what else is it not?
Okay. Don't you want a cookie?
Rach, wait, I can cancel...
You're plans were with us.
Oh my God, it was incredible.
So have you called her yet?
It's a... It's a boy!
That's a good call. Right.
How about, you're moving!!
Stick out your tongue.
Okay. Let's bring it in.
Why did they get divorced?
I'm not a baby, you're the baby.
They're still in my coat.
I'm still all those things!
Oh... what does that mean?
There's more beer, right?
I can't believe you're getting married!
Just the matter of ...payment?
It's just that, it's so much.
Phoebe, it's been two days.
So, what are you saying now?
Wait Chandler, what are you doing?!
Oh well, where is he?!
Chandler, where are your tools?
Wait, he's not here yet.
Really? The scientist guy?
That's what it sounded like.
Who wants it? Anybody?
What? Why, why would...
Please, I'm not going for anything.
Uh sorry, wrong number.
You think we're being obvious?
Well, I just lost my erection.
Not as each other!
Some moms do that.
Joey! Now that you're here...
Wafer thin ice!
Still smoking cigars?
So um, who was she?
Does it involve clogs?
Does it involve travel?
I don't know, clean places?
Well, we had a little fight.
Oh. Can I have a tissue?
Oh, is everything in the car?
Yep, we wanna get married!
Yeah, we're trying to get pregnant.
'I drink tea.'
You need to give him money.
Well, it just seems that...
Does it have to do with Joey?
But you told them you weren't?
What were you doing in Africa?
Hey, did you pick a roommate?
Joey, you don't have to finish that.
Oh. You're not gettin' it.
Hi.. how was the game?
What are you barking at?
Hey, did you stop by here?
Oh yeah, what are you reading?
Really? I don't really feel like it.
Excuse me Mr. Mexico.
But ehm...what is it not?
Did you break up with her?
It's 9:30 in the morning!
Well...I'd better get going.
I don't think this number's right!
Oh wait.. What are you doing?
Okay I'll take her, here.
Ow, what are the chances!
You just carry that around?
Scary pigeon's back?
So! He'll understand!
THAT'S NOT ME!
Okay Marjorie, hit it.
That was the adoption agency...
We're okay. I'm still ovulating.
I'm so glad you liked them!
Wow! Don't you look nice?!
I feel terrible, I really do.
Let me get you some coffee.
We have got to wash that!
I was the pile of coats!
This doesn't concern you!!
Ross, I thought you were over this.
That was a terrible throw!!
You're so efficient. I love you!
Okay, now you're even cuter!!
Yep! You got the tickets?
What uh-What did you-What?!
Too strong for me?
When did I sign for it?
Well, who's voice was that?
That's not really how it works.
I know. I need more pie.
I can't believe we're living here!
We are! Help us!
Makes me wanna puke!
Oh my God! Let me see.
I used to wet my bed.
And slept with the professor.
Just some stuff for the party.
So'd you guys have fun?
Crematorium Chris? Sure!
Hey, Rach, how's it going?
You painting his toenails?
Oh, you are so great! Thank you!
Ooh, are you gonna do magic?
Are you sure you wanna do this?
Ohh my God, I'm so sorry.
Why else would we be here?
Chandler, this actually bothers you?
Oh, I ordered mine first.
So, where do you want to go?
Yeah, but I don't think we have time.
No, no! Give it to me!
Deal! TIME LAPSE.
NO, NO, NOOO!
Hey Joey, come taste this.
Are we gonna take a limo?
That noise you just made?
You're not gonna mess it up.
What have you heard me sing?
Joey! I'm so proud of you!
Kiss him, you fool!!
I was in too much pain.
Score! Now can we go?
Wait what-wh-wh-what are you doing?!
...and head to Canada!
Sometimes I have bad dreams.
What are you doing with the lamp?
Well, uh, I ate some.
Does seem pretty perfect.
Okay, I think I get how to do this.
Or Spin the Bottle?
Oh, why? Why? What happened?
That's that weird voice again.
'Cause you invited your assistant.
Oh, let's not tell this story.
Chandler is such an idiot!
Um, I'm not actually Amish.
Oh, dad, turn it off.
Okay, I freaked out a little.
No-no-no, no! It's sensual!
Let her finish, doctor.
We didn't order cake.
How, how did that happen?
Why don't you just take it with you?
IT'S THE HUMIDITY!
Viva Las Gaygas!
Yeah, well they suck too.
You become friends after?
Really? Your work laugh?
Come here. Okay, be right back.
Yeah, I'm sorry. I'm-I'm so sorry.
Men are such idiots.
No you can't. She's yours!
Your mother told you this?
Pete's breaking up with me.
I'm a cool, fun aunt!
Okay, we're gonna need a distraction.
Nooooo. You're really not going?
Oh. Why didn't you take her?
You know, a party, or--
How? I don't have any money.
It doesn't make any sense.
Wait! Did you say 'G.Stephanopoulos?'
We checked. A lot.
Hi, I'm Ross's little sister.
Okay well that's good to know.
Just go get some! Go!
How 'bout just a boom?
Guys, we bought the tickets.
It's "Bolero" from "10".
You mean your pink shirt?
Ten dollars an hour.
Which one is which again?
Hey, guess what I'm doing tonight.
Yeah but I'm not keeping it.
I thought there wasn't a ball?
Does that sound like Janice?
But, I just cleaned the bathroom.
Try feeding her again.
Okay fine, now Ross...
Oh, so you like her too Chandler?
Score!! 7 to nothing!
Hey. It's him. Who is it?
Wow, what's the bad news!
Why isn't it working out?
Could not be more terrified.
You're not just saying that are you?
So, did you know Ross well?
That's right Patrick, bye-bye!
Nothing. I'm gonna take a shower.
She's in her room, why?
You still work at the multiplex?
You did it! You got ordained?!
Dammit, dammit, dammit!
Lucky bastard! Janice.
Thirty-two! Seventy-one! Hike!
About a half an hour.
We can't split them up!
I can't tell you. It's a secret.
Because the winner gets this!
Hi! Hey look who's here!
All right, everybody open them!
Okay-okay, I got it. I got it.
Oh, I'm gonna kill those guys.
I told you not to go down there!
Wow, you worked in a mine?
Love is the best medicine.
Oh-ho-ho, we've got company.
No, sweetie, I-I trust you.
Do you want me to pick you?!
And I would have to say pah-huh.
Really? Who's number two?
So, what have you guys been doing?
Two girls and a boy?
You know what? You can have mine.
Did you just smell my hair?
Yes? ..yes, she is.
I know, that's why I said again!
Phoebe, stop writing about us!
Pheebes, you know what I'm thinking?
All right, what's goin' on?
What?! You said he was sweet!
And I'm going to go get drunk.
You're right. Maybe I shouldn't go.
You know what? Let's not talk.
I can't find garbage bags!
Well, I guess now we can't go.
Pass the cheese, please.
Call us when you get there.
Phoebe, you'll catch pneumonia.
We're never gonna find anybody.
Oh, wait, and I got a beeper!
Who? Is that your sister?
Joey! You didn't even know her!
What about your massage client?
No, that is what the game is.
Wasn't there a little song?
Hello? It's the deli again!
That's probably what they'll say.
007 gets all the ladies.
Rachel! Let me in! Rachel!
I knew you didn't get a 1400!
Phoebe, what, what happened here?!
You al-you already had it?
I'm actually with her on this one.
I'll give you really good odds.
Why are so mad at him?
Rach, did you check the machine?
Oh wait I forgot my wrap.
Chip, is Chip Matthews.
Then I've gotta go. Bye.
No it's not, it's second.
See if he has ice.
All right, I'll try not to.
Put all my money in me.
Fine, I can do it. Whew.
That's right. Did you hear something?
He might still show up.
But Chandler lent you money!
Soakin' up all the culture.
What about the rest of Manhattan?!
Is that a bit you guys do?
Wow! She is pretty, huh?
Not a basset, a bassinet.
Okay, you ready to open yours?
Nana liked it rough!
From the tequila factory?
Does that smell bother you?
Oh, no no no no no.
So, should I call him back?
You guys, I am not that bad!
It might be kinda cool.
I thought you could use the help.
I used to love to play restaurant.
Hon, you gotta talk to Joey.
Bye... bye... BIRDIE.
Hugh! Hugh Grant!
One-Mississippi. Two-Mississippi. Three-Mississippi.
W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-...
I know! What is this, 1985?!
Just don't pick up your phone.
Joey, you know you don't actually have one.
Then why would he say it?
Did you go home and change?
Did you make brownies today?
What is the matter with your hand?
Something to remember me by!
Oh, I can't pass for 22?
Uch, you see, I'm ovulating.
Okay! All right! Let's do it!
Okay, you come up with an idea.
Are you saying I smell bad?
Maybe, do you need a tissue?
Then I won't have to kill you.
Hey, I thought you already had one.
Yeah I do rock that one.
Ooh... she backed out.
Aw, it's soo unfair.
I'm talking about me having a baby.
Okay, can we please go eat?
What?! You slept with Jason?
You owe me 20 bucks.
So she's a woman! So what?
Twelve dollars an hour.
Excuse me, where are you going?
Honey, sweetie, by the edges.
Oh, he's catching up to her!
We'll put buckles on it.
You're kidding! Where? Where?
Hey Chandler, wanna do it with me?
... everybody we know? Yeah.
Was your cabin pressurised?
Oh my god, what were you thinking?
Oh, we're not seeing a movie!
Wh?! What about my allergies?!
You used the Europe story!
Who wasn't invited to the wedding.
Wow. Joey, how do you do it?
"Marriage. It's not for everybody."
Why don't you just go out with her!
I wasn't. Let's get going!
You wanna get out of my face?
Hi, how are you doing Kelly?
Yeah? I'm proud of me too.
Yes, but we have to be fast.
No, no, no, that's Dina.
We didn't give you any money!
Hey, are we still on for tonight?
Yeah, okay, give that a try!
Well, that's it. Everything's packed.
Why the hell did you take her?
Is he gonna introduce us?
You just wanna each take one?
So, what are we gonna do today?
What did I tell you about the hall?!
Hey Joey, sweetie, taste this.
Just go over and say hi.
Well, you're not gonna get going are you?
Haven't we made this decision?
We just want you to think it through.
Ok, you have to stop playing now.
Hey Pheebs, how's it going?
Uh, where do you think you're going?
Oh, we're not doing that. Okay...
This woman's living my life.
Yes, they can stay with us.
Yeah, I think you should keep looking!
And this goes for all guys?
Okay mister! Fertilize me!
Oh! So you think I'm a failure!
Okay. Umm, Phoebe, you suck too.
Hey, what did you guys do today?
Oh my God, I was thinking four.
Wh-what are we gonna tell him?
This is your current cellphone?
Okay, he was talking about rules.
Oh my God! Kyle Lowder!
I'll get back to my new job.
Phoebe, we lost half of them.
Oh my God, we're gonna be parents!
See? It's no big deal.
Why do you want to see my hand?
What is it?! What about Pete?
Sure, what do you have in mind?
Oh my God, what are you gonna do?!
Can you believe Phoebe got pregnant?!
Ooh...hey honey, are you all right?
Well, you tell a lot of jokes!
That was a half an hour?
Really? If that's what you want...
Oh my God! Are-are you crying?
What, he doesn't like Josh?
We didn't get anything for anyone.
We need to talk to you about something.
Yeah, just like the one in the poem.
Rachel's really the one who's pregnant.
Wow! That is a great picture!
No one wanted seconds, right?
Phoebe, your liver is right here.
Hey, you got me, put it in.
Anything larger back there?
You start working on that list.
No, I'm wearing a wedding dress.
What kind of karate is that?
Spoon? So, what do you think?
Where did you get those jeans?!
But you live here! You know that.
I've gotta get back in the game.
Thank you Joey, thank you so much!
Dr. Burke, it, it's me.
Relax! It's Phoebe! Not you!
Fine. Go! Go! Go!
This is not the bed I ordered!
Yeah! Roses or Lilies?
I can't believe you let them win!
God bless you Chandler Bing!
Oh, look, he's waking up!
What a minute, what did he say?
Yeah, it takes two incomes.
Hi, that's what I'm doing for Phoebe!
You what? You said you liked them.
It was a really beautiful service.
Really, you want to wait a year?
The wedding starts at six.
Hey, you wanna go to see a movie?
Feeling a little better sweetie?
Ross, he's got the remote again.
So-so you would've just lied?
Yeah, come on, we can be guys!
I miss Rachel. No, my parents.
Oh, you got the whole night, huh?
Don't you love the huge yard?
That thing is not coming in here.
I didn't take a pregnancy test.
Hell no, we'll pay!
Do you think he knew I was here?
Third door on the left.
What? I-I said you had a-
Oh, I'm sorry. Can I get you something?
Promise me you'll be careful.
Cause I already invited her.
Pete, can I get you something else?
What if I turn out the lights?
You gave her food poisoning!?
I'm sorry, idea time is over.
I have to be up in seven minutes.
That is a slap in the face.
Well then we still have a problem.
Name one of his books.
So, what do you think we should do?
Okay, throw it straight this time.
All right, we should call somebody.
Yeah, but at least I'm doing it!
Sit down! We're winning!
I clunked your heads together!
Stop it Chandler. I'm sorry too.
What if they get mixed up?
He's totally flirting with you too.
That's-that's not Phase Three.
Yeah, he's just gotta get a shot.
Yes. But all the other ones.
Phoebe, you're gonna be with your grandma?
Sweetie, I wanted you to have him too.
So you hit her in the face?
Oh, thank you! What's going on?
Serve the ball, chump!
That's Phoebe! Where did you get that?
It's coming from the living room.
It's my New Year's resolution!
Y'know...go! Go! Right there!
Rachel, what're you gonna say to him?
That's because I'm in front of them.
Okay! Oh my God, thank you!!
Wow! That guy is so rude!
Oh, they-they sent me home.
No. He's not a horrible guy.
They won't take you to the vet.
So I got it when I was 13...
Ross, I can't believe you'd do that!
Okay, here comes another camera.
I don't have her number, butt-munch.
Well Phoebe doesn't eat turkey...
Who are they killing off?
I think I hear curtains closing...
What are you doing here so early?
Umm, can we see you ride it?
All right, I...I have to ask.
okay, Pheebs, theyre gone.
Would you stop staring at her?
OK. Just for a little while.
Chandler, you're not gonna die alone.
Weeeell, it's rum, and-
Hey Ross. What's up bro?
It's kind of an important one!
It's actually going to be just family.
Okay, he's a senior in college.
No, that landed in your food!
It's gonna be a problem, isn't it?
Rach, come see who's out here!
Mmh... this cake is amazing!
Maybe he didn't give you a chance.
Damn it! Rookie mistake!
Oh. Maybe they're- napping.
Oh, I'm sorry, mrs Hannigan.
The pink one with the flowers?!
Chandler, I'm gonna die a virgin!
Really? My God, he's really cute.
I knew you were not okay with that.
They thought Joey was a child?
Okay, let's talk about something else.
Oh, look at these little bunnies!
What do you do with your money now?
I'm sorry, I'll give it back to you.
Electrical plans for the building.
Rachel, the cute doctors are here.
"I'm a little bit country"...
Rach, he's a friend of ours.
Y'know which one was she again?
You were going to cut me out?
All right, I'll see you guys later.
Okay that does sound like fun.
Tell me about yourself, Zack!
How's the big anniversary dinner?
I do, but Rachel borrowed them.
No-no! Don't do it! Don't!
Here, take a couple of these.
Oh, I love it! Thank you so much!
Oh my God. He threw up?
As much as they love you?
Friday's perfect...She can't wait.
So how's it going with you guys?
Whoa!!! Are you kidding me?!
Joey's gonna be *so* upset.
Phoebe, come on, you have to tell us.
Yes! And that would be a shut-down!
Oh sweetie, I'm so proud of you!
It is not over! You're over!
Shoot! We're out of soda.
Yes, but you are dead inside.
Wait, did you know it was twins?
I can't be fair. You're my boyfriend.
Come on! It wasn't that bad!
I know, I just thought it would be fun.
Yeah, what, do you think we're stupid?
Ahh, Phoebe, I'm gonna miss you!
Oop, your cake is ready!
Nobody cares about the Dakotas.
Well there's not much we can do.
I wanna watch Entertainment Tonight.
Will! From high school.
That's sweet. Drink your hair.
It's nice to meet you. Janine...?
Ross, cough drops, please?
Chandler! Phoebe's hogging the game!
Okay, Phoebe you know what you're doing right?
Yes, I did! And you are welcome!
In 1981 you were 13!
Hey, Rach, did you make your money?
I just wanted to see how it's going.
Oh my God! It's like one mind.
You're mother killed herself!
I'll meet you there in two minutes.
My parents will be so happy.
No! Rachel is meeting us here.
We are on a roll, people!!
I have no idea what you just said.
Phoebe, can I talk to you for a second?
Oh that's sweet. Don't touch me.
Then all your stuff would be here.
Yes!! Yes! Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Come on! I really need your help!
That's Will from high school!
Chandler? Can you give me a hand?
I know.. it's gonna be really hard.
Really? I only had two glasses.
No, you were right. I don't have a plan.
That's it big girl! Come on!
Hey honey! I missed you today!
Did I squeeze it too hard?
No, you are not. We tell you stuff.
So what did you do today Pete?
Oh, but wait I do have a globe.
So, is Joey gonna stop snoring?
Your a poet and don't know it.
What are you talking about? What wedding?
Well do something! Get in there!
Yeah, that'd be great! Thank you!
I just thought he was nice, y'know?
All right, what about the third guy?
Pulling what? It's second down.
Isn't he an architect now?
Oh, you're breaking up with Tony?
Well, why would she lie to you?
Would it really have been that easy?
I'm just trying to spice it up!
What do you think brought than on?
So, are you sorry that I told them?
Hi, Dad, what are you doing here?
You wanna fool around with Joey?
Do you know what's a bad idea?
Rach! It's me! Pick up!
No, it's more like a good luck.
Chandler's making his sex face.
Wait! Oh my God! I can't get out!
I make the decisions, and I say no.
I gave you a key for emergencies!
Oh-ho, look what I got Julio.
007 has a fancy car!
Oh good, I think so too. Pheebs?
We are not friends with Phoebe anymore.
No-no-no! We need something old!
Oh my God Phoebe, you're on fire!
Good. And Rachel Green too.
Rachel, get the book! The book!
That's it. That's my worse Thanksgiving.
Seriously, what is this supposed to mean?
I'm sure they'll be here soon.
What?! You're going out with her again!
Did they just kill off Joey?
Oh, I was hoping you wouldn't remember.
Phoebe! Put that cigarette out!
Maybe I do! I'm pretty feisty!
I thought you were going out with Elizabeth.
Never call me from that phone.
So to get this part you can't be?
Oh my God! You're water broke!
Why is this car in my bedroom?
Oh my God Chandler! I can't believe it!
I know! Hey, how's Chandler doin'?
Stop it!! That's not funny!!
Umm, and looking at people differently.
Why would they think they're invited?
Phoebe, you have to lift it and point.
I have some pretty exciting news!
Here you go. You can wear this.
I don't need a tissue! I'm fine-d!
I swear you said you had the keys.
Which one was Pete Carney?
Hey, you touch that and you will be sorry.
Oh my God, are you out of a job?
No leg-chewing for us sir.
A tiny salt shaker!!!
: Hi, how was your flight?
Well, no. You're Chandler. Y'know, Chandler!
Yeah. What d'you wanna do tonight?
I hope Ross isn't too upset.
Oh, and the newspaper delivery guy.
I was just waiting for the perfect guy.
C'mon guys, it'll be fun!
That bastard taped over me!
You were my first kiss ever?
She's leaving for three months.
Ross, I'm gonna use yours, okay?
I need to borrow a hundred bucks.
Phoebe, you were supposed to take that back!
It's kind of a package deal!
You're gonna do some feet flirtin'!
Why? What did you do in the bathroom?
You don't want to know what tonight was.
No, I just I think that it's too soon.
We're gonna see each other naked.
Guys, you got your hair cut.
Aww, thank you. Uh Rach?
Okay, good! Okay, what do I want now?
Fine. She's wearing my bra!
Chicken Soup for the Soul?
Hey! How'd the audition go?!
Chicken? I could eat some chicken.
Oh, did you do a picture of Emma?
Actually, I was gonna do them jullienne.
Well, why don't we just bunny up.
All right, let's go say good-bye.
You still have feelings for me don't you?
What happened in Atlantic City?!
Hey! How did it go with Elizabeth?
Boy, do I have a surprise for you!
OK, try this salmon mousse.
What?! I-I-I don't, I don't do that!
Okay, well, stop staring at them.
I just had the most amazing bath.
Oh God, I am so sorry honey...
This doesn't mean anything, does it?
And you know what? We want a rematch.
I sure do! And you don't get one!
Does he not make enough money?
I'm sorry, but that's my happy place.
Well, how bout just her mom?
Oh wait! Stop! Stop! Stop!
Our guy's a great dancer!
I hate men! I hate men!
WE'RE GETTING A BABY!
Hey, Joey's ass! What are you doing?
Come here, I want to show you something!
Ok, well, what kind of ritual?
I wanna say good-bye at the car!
They won't be ready for weeks.
Haven't you and I covered that topic?
I know! I know, I'm so sorry for you!
God, I feel so guilty about Ross.
So, Phoebe runs weird huh?
I was probably waiting for it to open.
Why don't you go see Dr. Gettleman?
Ohh. And I don't even have a date.
What does she mean by 'involved'?
Y'know what? I'll think you'll play.
Yeah, but that's pigs not people!
What? Something happened with the plates?
I wish all guys could be like him.
I don't get older. I just get better!
Oh wow! Okay. Well that was fun.
So, Chandler, who's on your list?
You can't be a lawyer. You're eight.
Y'know, the possible side affects.
Oh dad, really you don't need to...
We don't, we don't wrestle now.
Hey, Joey, could you pass the cheese?
Well, are you just hanging out with Ross?
Ready for your birthday lunch?
DON'T...be too long with the phone.
Well, the club lost it's power.
I'm sorry that I borrowed your gloves
I know, but you have to open it today!
I think you're better than you think you are.
Do you not remember the puppet guy?
I am good. I finished my book.
Chandler? Do you promise to be good?
I was trying to help out a squirrel.
OK, what're we gonna do about this?
You were just being so nice to him!
Oh. I'm sorry it didn't work out.
Okay, now we just need something borrowed!
Joey!! What the hell were you doing?!
Helloooo? Yeah. Oh my God. Thanks.
But, I put some honey in it.
Ohhh, Chandler, sorry! Hey, Janice.
Heads! No, Tails! He-he-heads!
5 6 7 8!
I won't know what I would do without you.
He didn't ask me to marry him.
Chasing him all around the room?
You've got to be smooth about it.
Oh my God!!! What are you doing?!!
Uh, you left out the stupid part.
Wait! Wait! This isn't take-out!
I guess you have forgotten all about Joey?
I had to go with the odds Rach.
No he went out to get pizza.
Y'know what?! I gotta go! Ugh!
Okay, you're-you're really freaking me out.
What kinda things have you been saying?
Is your tongue swelling up?
Shrill?! The wedding is back on!
Son of a gun, it is!
Umm, she Rach, not it, she.
All right, I definitely taste nutmeg.
Oh nothing I'm just-just was yawning.
It's in the kitchen, I'll go get it.
Well, it's like that. With feelings.
Oh my God. She's gonna pick us!
Oh my God, I wrecked your baby!!
Okay, if it means that much to you...
So you talked to your dad, huh.
Well, I just caught the live show.
Okay! My turn! My turn!
Phyllis sees what I'm doing.
How would I know? I-I wasn't here.
God! If you're gonna cry about it!
Ahh! Aren't you dressed yet?
I don't think mine likes me either.
Hey Phoebe, will you give me a hand?
You got a callback too didn't you?
Making her a mixed tape?
You're the best friend I ever had.
Is he not cute enough for you?
You're a pig. And you can't do this.
No, we're not! We're not leaving!
Wouldn't you love to do it just once?!
Didn't she walk with a cane?
Hey, how long are you in the city?
You broke a little girl's leg?!!
Seriously, where did you get the hat?
Yeah. Which one do you like more?
How long has it been this time?
I guess. Why? Who's she with?
Stop it, stop it, stop it!
What?! You can't-what did you tell her?
No-no. Nothing wrong about that.
Alright. My job here is done.
There you go, enjoy your coffee.
Oh God, you fell off the wagon.
Well umm, Alexandra has been...
You did? What was he talking about?
Do you always have to bring him here?
There it is. Joey, what are you doing?
I know. Where do you wanna go eat?
Alright, well I'm tearing the lettuce.
Is your team winning hon?
Yes! You are so smart! I love you.
That's not true, you don't have a moustache.
Hey! My first review is out!
Oh, just until the glue dries.
I'll help you fix your sweater.
Y'know all my friends think this is weird.
That really was some of your best work.
This is a boy, and that's a girl.
So the going for help went well?
Hi. Do you know what time it is?
Yeah well, I ran into Richard.
Whatever you decide, whatever you do.
Oh! Do you need me to go with you?
Ugh! Well, y'know, we were away...
Alright, what was this sentence originally?
No, you said the baby creeps you out.
OK, I'll see you later babe.
So Ross, are you gonna bring Mona?
Please tell me you're stopping now.
So? What do you think of the house?
Is that a secret or a lie.
Oh good, I hate it when you do that.
No! Chandler and I are moving in together!
Thank God! I can't watch him anymore!
Nah... not-not special enough.
I didn't think you could keep it a secret.
Ethan, it's um... it's icky.
Ohh, you're about to get a little luckier.
Oh, right! I completely forgot about that.
Joey, where are the Jell-o shots?
This is kind of a classy place.
You can spill. In the sink.
Oh my God, Mike was gonna propose?
You didn't tell anybody I was did you?!
Oh my God! Oh my God! You have to go!
Weren't you asked to leave sonny?
It doesn't go with any of my stuff.
Yes it has! I made cookies!
And Mindy, your maid of...?
Nah, he doesn't do anything for me.
Fine, I'll rub it on myself.
Why can't you use the phone in here?
Please.. please, we are so close.
What are peanut butter fingers?!
God, look what I found in the drain.
You gotta help me out here Pheebs.
Ah, so glad you decided to come.
Did you know I was allergic to shellfish?
So it's okay to date a student.
OK, here you go. Good luck.
Five more and I'll flash you.
Me neither! We have to get in!
Can you go any faster with that?
Oh God! What did I just step on?
Come in. I've been waiting for you.
It's just, I'm not good at singing.
Ok. Hey, why don't you ask Richard?
You kissed a guy?!! Oh my God.
So? Do you think we should get it?
I don't know who I'm happiest for...
Oh, Candy! She was so spunky!
Joey... we always know what you mean.
Just waiting for it to stop bubbling.
Hello? Eighth street deli?
Wait! Joey! Joey! Are you okay?!
Rachel! That was a library card!
What, that little thing at the prom?
Honey, you're not pathetic, you're sad.
No, I called him. It's not gonna happen.
'Slim Pickings'...That is so cheesy.
The Luisa from home room!
Joey, Chandler knows I borrowed the money.
We're kidding. C'mon, tell us!
Right there! That was so fake!
Why, do you write him a lot?
Hey, the man's dog just died.
"Willing to adopt triplets?" No!
Okay, just get a lot better. Fast.
Promise to call me when you land.
Well, you used to like playing the guitar.
Do you want our guy to be your guy?
Where you can make out with your assistant.
Seriously, you don't think we should tell him?
We were just waxing our legs.
Oh, yay. Ok about that two.
You're jealous of Princess Caroline?
Oh yeah, picked a guy, 37135.
Oh stop it. Joey already told me.
We'll discuss it, in the morning!
I know!!! My erection is back!
Chandler, you don't believe in soul mates?
Tea gives Phoebe the trots.
I'm checking out the restaurant with Pete.
Careful. Careful. CAREFUL! Sorry.
Hey everybody! It's Fun Bobby!
Phoebe, I thought you said you know what you're doing?
You didn't even take off your pants.
Kinda like your Barca lounger.
Demi Moore is not a he.
Ok everybody, it's time for flan.
Hi. I'll be ready in just a second.
Hey, I could've had you if I wanted you.
I don't know, Chandler. Let's take a look.
They just gonna love you, just be yourself.
Did you like learn about her family?
What are you doing here? You can't be here!
Oh. Big family dinner tonight?
Thank you. Just make yourself comfortable.
Wow. That is not a happy hi.
I can't believe Phoebe's gonna have her babies!
What-what was it you were gonna tell us?
Everyone at our school heard it!
Sure, what? Ok, ok. Music?
Are you gonna dress up as Santa?
Oh, then it must've been you. Bye.
Anyway, how did it go with Kate?
Well, actually, I'm already seeing someone.
No, I don't think it ever works. Why?
Why? Do you have a report due?
Gunther, can I get a coffee to go?
Oh my God! You don't know me at all!
No, don't say it! Don't even think it!
You went out with Wallis Pincer?
Don't you want to look through the rest?
Really? I'd say 3 to 4.
About that? Erm...I'm going to change.
Do you wanna come in for some lemonade?
Have you even had a girl up here?
You read comic books right?
Yeah, I know. He can get really competitive.
Is there? Is there someone else?
I'll put a pillowcase over my head.
Chandler, wh-why don't we sit down?
Strip Happy Days Game?
I thought you said you were going to do nothing.
All you had to do was buy the card!
Why don't we just find a place for it?
What?!! You cannot tell him that!!
Great, now he's waving back.
A love scene? With who?
That's ok. I'm sorry I poisoned you.
Honey why don't you go lie down.
We do not have one of those signs.
But no. Maybe if I were baking.
Heyyy!! You got the door open!!
Joke. Joke. Blah! Blah!
That's different! I was drunk and stupid!
Wow! A lipper from Chipper.
Okay well I think...that's your answer.
Have you guys picked a date yet?
Oh my God! Have you lost your mind?
Rach, why won't they take it back?
Okay, come on, do it one more time!
Nice! Wow Phoebe you are good!
Okay. Can you give me a little push?
Hey Joey, I don't think we can use this.
Ehm, we were friends in 1992.
Me going out with Richard's son.
I guess they're back from their date.
And they weren't looking at you before?!
All right, look I'm just gonna unplug it.
GET OUT YOU DUFUS!!
Breathe, breathe, breathe... Good.
Y'know what, I'm gonna hold her head.
Hey, look at you! Where have you been?
Because Chandler still has feelings for you!
Come on, we can't let them win!
Honey, cover it up with the boat!
Shoot, I think I got mayonaise on you.
Rachel, things can get incredibly complicated.
I mean, that's a typical guy response.
Who? Two divorces and Joey?!
It's the heat. And-and the humidity.
Oh, gosh, you got some on your shirt.
It's just a little bit more, honey.
Well, we could start trying. Now.
I thought I was something that we both wanted!
Okay, so Ross will be doing the reading.
It's.. It's just so pretty and white.
Okay, okay... Chandler you... you stop it!
Do you wanna do it at the same time?
Ross they're really, really, really white.
Rach, are you really gonna let him do this?
It's enough for wedding scenario eight.
So this is it, we're really gonna adopt?
Why won't I be married when I'm 40?
You still want to move in together right?
Sorry. So how's it going with Joey?
So ah, Phoebe, how was your date?
We're-we're really sorry we fogged you.
Well we... we kinda broke up.
Hey, check me out, I'm a slut!
Hello, people who do not live here.
Yeah! And I got it on sale, too.
Did he just say 'Monica bang'?
He said he's really gonna miss you guys.
I'm sorry, I don't understand what you just said.
Well, Ross was mugged as a kid.
Because we won our apartment back!
Is it okay for me to come in now?
Hang on a second I just got in.
Okay everybody, let's go! Let's go!
Rachel!! Come on! Let me in!
But I thought if you left, you get fired.
How do you know she's gonna start talking?
Yeah, let-let-let's pretend that's not true.
Uh-huh, what exactly did you ask her?
Okay, I just don't get why you like it so much.
And yet, we're still poking him.
All right everybody, this turkey is ready!
Plus, everyone's gonna see your thing.
Ross, I hated you when we were kids.
Like only if the queen comes?
Wait! You're supposed to wear a costume!
What about when I started dating Chandler?
Hello? Hold on. It's your boss.
Have you ever taken out the trash?
I know. How could we have let this happen?
I'm just so glad you got to see the babies.
So, wait, you really did like my cookies?
Oh, I love my life, I love my life!
Chandler! He's seven; he's not stupid.
Boy, you are really not a morning person.
I can't believe he's that upset about this...
Good. What made you change your mind?
Uh, good hands. Healing hands.
Rach, does this have nonfat milk?
Okay, okay... Okay, I feel a little better.
Oh, thank you. Would you like a tour?
If I tell you, you'll think I'm crazy.
Well, we appreciate anything you can tell us.
Wait, now so you joined the gym?
I can't answer that! Chandler's my husband.
Okay, knock yourself out, Larry.
And yet, here we are doing it again.
Please, just a little bit off the back.
Say good-bye to sore muscles!
There are no tickets on the nightstand!
Thanks. So, I guess I better be going.
So, I guess you're next. You're ready?
Janice, what umm, what are you doing here?
Hmm, a little relieved, I gotta say.
So you're moving in with him. What happened?
They really were pretty, weren't they?
Rachel, he like, totally changed time.
Hey, come on, Phoebe, you understand don't you?
I guess Joey was right, it does nothing.
Come in! Come in! We're engaged!!!
Are you freaking kidding me, Green?
What did you do to his sweater vests?
Can you just hold on for one minute?
Eh, we weren't that close anyway!
Welcome to our side of the tunnel.
Aw, sometimes. Always, actually.
Yeah, we had a great time, thank you!
We were shopping, and we had lunch.
So Chandler, I guess I'll see you at dinner.
Home is Home Star stew.
I'm sorry that I made you stop seeing him.
I don't believe in soul mates either.
No-no-no, wait! We need something old!
Yes but my mom got me this job.
Are you saying that you don't wanna get with this?
Y'know you're really not supposed to be back here!
Again. Y'know what? I think we all did.
Ross, she's 25 years old.
: I'm gonna go freshen up ok.
You're right. I'm sorry. I should've told you.
Who do you wanna fool around with?
Looks like he's playin' baseball.
Oh no! You weren't supposed to see this!
Umm, do you have any uhh, moves?
Please! I made this game what it is.
Shut up!! It just got interesting!
Oh God, you are about to get sooo lucky.
We'll just...we'll just let her stay.
That is so funny. Let me see that.
What the hell is that dog doing here?!
Carol moved her stuff out today.
And so, we're hiding in the bathroom.
And lucky means, more cleavage?
Did you eat all the neighbor candy?!
Nothing, I just heard something nice about you.
She sent the chicken back again?!
Yeah, like you're gonna be pregnant. I mean pregnant.
That cold makes you sound so great.
Chandler, please, come on. Look at him.
Oh, that's what I would do, forget mine.
It-it's so great to see you both here.
Rach, Phoebe hates Pottery Barn.
There was just one woman, wasn't there?
That, you get? That, you get?
Cassie needs to stay at your place.
Richard buzzed. He's waiting downstairs.
Joey, what are you gonna do when you have a baby?
You want a problem? I'll give you a problem!
And the fact that they're both monkeys.
Chandler has two copies of Annie!
I'm so sorry. Please, stop freaking out.
Wait a minute, y'know, you're bringing me!
You seriously changed your name to that?
Oh! They're late and they're sloppy!
Honey? Is that something you're making up?
Phoebe, she sounded pretty upset to me.
Well good, here let me help you out.
So, you wore your nightie to dinner?
Okay, d'y'see anybody you think could be me?
That's right baby! Okay, what do I want now?
Oh, god, I am so spoiled... That's it!
Are you funny? Tell us a joke!
My God! Is this a gym card?
People! People say it! Come here!
That's not your regular dry cleaners.
Y'know what, you can play with my dollhouse.
Oh my God yes! Who is she?
You bet! No TV or anything!
Oh that's an eye removal machine.
He- he pooped in my shoe.
We weren't picking up, it's Amanda!
He is the man in the black dress.
Does anybody wanna split this with me?
Damn it, I did not think this through!
It's umm, it has something to do with transponding.
Good, they feel good, in my head.
Oh good, I'm glad that's catching on.
Y'know those are a delicacy in India.
Okay! Oh God, y'know what? It's really bad.
Yeah! Joey has the best boyfriend ever!
Freemont. West-Westmont, ah Westburg?
Grand Supreme Little Darling?
Well umm, Chandler and I are moving in together.
Fair enough, now go get ready!
No, although now that's what I'm thinking.
Hey. Call me when you get there. Okay?
But then how do we know who wins?
Wait-wait, go back to that sibling thing.
Look, I- I could go on pretending-
What if he reads it in the paper?
Don't you see? It's the perfect crime!
What do you mean "what do we do"?
Maybe we should just tell your parents first.
If Phoebe were my maid of honor...
Joey, that paper's like a year old!
Shut up! This place is a hole!
So, we're just four losers... SUPER!
If the school finds out you're fired.
Because they'll know we've been listening.
God, I'm sorry! I'll go back and get it!
You said you loved me! I can't believe this!
Because she's not gonna get to keep the babies.
Wow! Uh what, did he uh, say?
They're kissing let's just go around them.
These aren't for you! Are you upset?
I know. It's just such reckless spending.
Fun? Fun, you think this is fun?
You mean you know Paul like I know Paul?
Ok fine. I'll handle this. Phoebe?
Come on, she'll be here any minute.
Just figured, 'cause you and Ross are...
Stop sending food to our apartment.
Is-is-is there a-a Mrs. Stevens?
You made a joke right? So I laughed.
Did the girl ever let you ride it?
She's my favorite character on DOOL.
Umm, I-I really don't want to tell this story.
And a lot could still get in our way.
Nice try; I'm keeping the boots.
Umm, listen there's something I think you should know.
All right, all right, at least I'm prepared.
So maybe we should just. . .
How many kids were we gonna have?
Oh my God! He's gonna rat me out!
Yeah-yeah, you remember how I call you bunny?
It's okay honey, you'll find a name.
Yes Rachel, why do you care so much?
Well I-I really don't remember the name of it.
No, only because that's the graduation song.
Have you seen Rachel? Or a mirror?
Well, what made you make the exception for me?
It's out on the island. It's in Massapequa.
Newark airport. Why, where are you?
But I thought you wanted to live by yourself.
Is it the same thing that Chandler had?
Where is the James Taylor CD?
Y'know what, let's do the catering business.
Wow! It's like Rachel in High School.
Let go! I'm a tiny little woman!!
Who is also in charge of purchasing.
Oh my God! Where the hell have you been?!!
Please! I am not as bad as Ross.
I can't believe you're not gonna be here for Christmas.
I mean I-I don't I think I have enough quarters.
I knew you were likely to take a wife!
I just can't stand you being here all the time.
Call them mom and dad you loser!
Then get over yourself! Grow up!
Yeah you're right. I don't know what I was thinking.
You know the words! You are so into this!
All right, we'll call you when we get back.
Yeah could-could-could you get me something to drink?
And she wants to go hunting, too!!
Hey, you just got in 5 minutes ago!
We heard about your pants, I'm so sorry.
yeah oh my god, I'm so moved.
Oh my God, ice just got in my eye!
My boyfriend really does have good taste!
She is unbelievable, our mother is...
Making holiday candy for the neighbors.
Noo! I'll stay. He's my brother.
I know you do. Me too. So what now?
You know what? I-I think I'll wait out here.
Yeah, they do seem to feel pretty bad.
So we can be friends who sleep together.
So what? Don't you have any will power?
Alright, we're gonna have to unscrew the chain.
Hey-hey-hey. You wanna hear something that sucks.
I don't remember. Do you wanna take a walk?
Can we just start throwing things in?
Well I didn't want everyone to think I was stupid.
This is just Bactine. It won't hurt.
Oh, um, I don't know if that's a good idea.
Oh, wait a minute! Who's is the father?!
You were my Midnight Mystery Kisser?
Oh, so there is gonna be a fifth date?
Only if you say his full name.
Have you ever been to one of my weddings?
Do you mind telling us what it is?
I LOVE MY NEW JOB!
Okay Phoebe, we should probably go back now.
Relax. Y'know, she may not even know.
So Joey, why didn't you grow a moustache?
You got the job?! Why didn't you tell me?
: how do you know I have one of those?
At least you took me down with you!
Not one that can pee on the roof.
Honey, I just don't think that you understood the joke.
I proposed to Chandler! Alright, moving on...
So then, are you going to dump Jason?
Hey! How'd your date go with Jake?
Awww, come on-wait-stop it. Okay, to Monica.
I don't know. Maybe we're some kinda magnets.
No. Not after what happened with Steve.
Oh my God, he's beautiful. Thank you so much.
Y'know what, champ? I think I'll pass.
Oh my God! What were you doing in a library?
Oh, hey! Oh good, you brought food!
: But you don't remember sleeping with her.
Yeah, a lot. A lot, a lot!
Here you go! What do you think about centerpieces?
I'm parked in a garage on Morton!
Harder than it sounds. Isn't it?
Yeah, apparently, they're pretty good seats.
What about the part where he has rabies?
I don't know how any of these got opened?!
See ya.... Waitwait, what's with you?
Okay. Does it have to do with Ross and Rachel?
Can you hear me say "You're grounded"?
When, when did-how, how did you...
Ok, how about pilgrim Mockolate mousse?
What about these? These look the same?
Uhh, not much. Uh, work's good.
I've gotta tell you, Bob is terrific.
It's no big deal, I do it all the time.
Oh, thank god! Emma, there you are!
It's so unfair, you don't even like your job!
Rachel is not going to pick your stupid guy.
No, too late. You can't give it back!
So, um, how-how did you guys meet?
Do you really want to pull at that thread?
This is Chandler's chicken. This is the turkey.
Oh, George, baby, drop the towel!
Yes Phoebe, but this is all I have. Okay?
Oh yeah! What was his superpower again?
Thank you. My hair is very amused.
Yes... What is the end of that sentence?
Alright. Just keep him away from me.
: Ok This is how much I love you.
So umm, how was your date with Ginger?
Actually, I'm gonna go check on the twins.
You have scratches all over you, what happened?
Shut up, and put my table back.
Why? 'Cause otherwise you'd go for it?
She looks exactly like Aunt Marilyn.
Only if I don't have to get up and sing.
Is it something you'd be interested in?
Sure, we have no money, go ahead.
Yeah, uh, it's actually not that big a deal.
What?! There's only been like four kids.
Oh, my fiancee wants the Swing Kings.
It was Michelle. It was definitely Michelle.
Well, I think I shouldn't look directly at them.
Hi Dad! I can still call you that right?
All the time. In fact, I was undefeated.
It's okay. I don't care. It's uh, it's fine.
Hey! What did you decide to do about the movie?
Joey just hired Chandler to be his assistant!
Wha... How the hell is that gonna help?
Well, I thought that I would cut up the tomatos.
Yeah, you miss alot, when you're moo-ing.
Are you gonna be ok, officer, uhm,...
Oh good, Lenny and Squigy are here.
My turn? What-what are you talking about?
People have got to finish their stories!
I'm dicing, I'm dicing, I don't hear anything.
Would you ever be a surrogate for anyone?
No because it-it didn't seem important.
No Joey, I think he's just watchin' TV.
Because I don't work at the Szechwan Dragon.
Chandler! Chandler! I just figured out who you are!
How much did ever really win before?
Look at you, you won't even look at him.
What happened to Santa, Holiday Armadillo?
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.
I guess I wanted to keep it as a souvenir.
So basically, this is a getting-rid-of-everything-Rachel-ever-used sale.
There is no alley behind Macy's.
Okay, where is the Kat Stevens CD?
Well, that's it You gonna crash on the couch?
Wow, those pills really worked, huh?
A monkey. Have you seen a monkey?
Chandler stole a twenty from my purse!
So, you think you'll do it on his couch?
Is that some kind of boat talk?
How did it go with Frank and Alice?
Still, I was quick as a cat.
Ross, you've got to do something about the humping.
Yeah, I saw him waiting for an elevator.
I'm sorry, Joey. I'm gonna go to bed, guys.
Hi. Richard just told me he loves me.
Noooo! I'm lying. I am so drunk.
Hey, Rachel, Can-can I see you for a sec?
Hey! You smell like perfume and cigarettes.
I can't believe you guys are actually getting tattoos.
Heads up Ross! Score! You suck!
Hey Rach, aren't these candlesticks mine?
Gotcha. When do we tell them about this?
So this is what a stroke feels like.
So are you ever gonna tell whoever it is?
That's right, because I forbid you to smoke again.
Well I don't have them either. Where are they?
And! We also have speaker phone.
Well, high school was not my favourite time.
Ross, if you don't tell them, then I will!
People are supposed to wanna hang out here!
No. But I remember people telling me about it.
I'm sorry I almost made you sleep with Ross.
Well, not... worried, just... wondering.
She and Phoebe took the stripper to the hospital.
Got the keys? or Got the keys!
Hey, you think, you can keep it another night?
Hey, Joey, what would you do if you were omnipotent?
Yeah! Yeah! His name is Chandler and...
Well at least, I'm going to mute it.
Well, go over to her! She's not with anyone.
Oh, no thanks, we're just here to observe.
Oh, y'know what, I can't, it really kills.
yep, that's me, I am that stupid .
How many fingers am I holding up?
Could've played Monopoly, but nooooo.
..I dunno, a little too Alan?
Let's see, today's Monday... Never.
So, do you want me to watch Ben for you?
No! But I know exactly what I'm going to say.
Okay! Okay! Make me sterile, but okay.
Oh God, maybe he won't see us. Richard!
Yes it is! You saw me wearing it!
But, we pick again! We pick again!
Shhh! We just got her to go to sleep.
All I have is, is oregano and a Fresca.
Oh no, was I cleaning in my sleep again?
Or "Win, Lose or Draw".
Listen, I... I don't think this is the best time.
Richard's living room, drinking wine.
I swear, if you try it, you will love it!
You can not play bagpipes at the wedding!!
Joey, this is for you. It's blackberry curin.
Why, what's wrong with my bathroom floor?
Was he falsely accused of something?
Yeah, I tried to gnaw myself free.
I promise you, he would definitely want you back.
Oh look, and he did my crossword puzzle.
So you gave in and decided to call someone?
A hat! Yes! We need a hat.
Is he crazy?! You just had Ross's baby!
Chandler, you have to tell Joey that you're not in Tulsa.
Oh my God! Fog him! Fog him!
Oh please, you just want more blue pins.
I'm really getting tired of sneaking around.
Do you want to go out on a date with her?
That'll teach you to lick my muffin.
Hey, Rachel, isn't that stuff almost pure...
Oh yes! I have it right here, on ice!
Dad, Chandler was just laughing at your joke.
Okay, look at this one. This is my favourite.
Oh gosh, Phoebe, I think I caught your cold.
Oh, sweetie. Oh, look at you. You're shivering.
I hear ya. Excuse me for just a second!
Honey you-you got to beat your scores!
Oh, it is sooo perfect. Thank you so much.
Uh, Rach, it's the Visa card people.
Bet I know how that discussion's going to go.
Yes, I would like something. No, no thank you.
Oh my God! I have nothing left to teach you!
Can you believe he just offered me a restaurant?
I know the code to his answering machine.
Yes you did. You absolutely sold me...
Uh, look, officer... uhm Sir...
Okay. Well, it's good news. It's good news.
We could, or we can have sex in it.
Oh. Well did you get it? Let me see.
There's an ad for a naked chef?
Blow drying what, you have no hair.
How about a Youhoo with a funny straw?
Oh no! Did you take my bra too?!
No, I-I haven't seen your pink shirt.
Yes you did! You did like a little hop.
And I'm a wuss. And we should be partners.
Oh, please, that is such a lame excuse!
Didn't your dad used to call you Pumpkin?
How about at a game, on the big screen?
Phoebe, why is there a dog in our apartment?
Look, you and I went to different high schools...
Wow, do you mean like kiss him-kiss him?
I have not been sick in over three years!
Check your numbers! Make me rich!
I knew that! Rachel! Use you're head!
Well, it just seems like a really small number.
Ross! He's playing with my spatulas again!
Hey wait a minute, this one isn't dirty.
Oh, you're totally welcome! What'd she say?
Hey, don't blame me for wigging tonight!
When it's your assistant, I would say never.
Then, I'd steer clear of Phoebe.
Hi. It is so, so nice to meet you.
Ethan, focus. How could you not tell me?
Oh, look at those little fingers and toes!
Oh Soap Opera Digest award!
You're not gonna believe this. Okay, so I go over...
Well, we're still talking about it, aren't we?
That's it! Right there! Is all I wanted!
Well, can't you just have the party when we get back?
All right. Honey, that's-that's a sleeve. Okay?
Well, usually when I'm this anxious, I clean!
Hey Chandler! Did you like the macaroni and cheese?
I'm sorry, why is this girl going to call me?
Yeah. I hope she can kick his ass.
If you're not going then I don't want to go either.
Well, the giraffe's okay. And so is the pirate.
Has somebody been drinking my fat?
Okay. Okay, I'm ready. Come on big fella!
Are you serious? You still see Dr. Gettleman?
Hey, we can take her back with you if you want.
What do you have against the beautiful guest room?
Nice to meet you! My God you're great!
My boyfriend said he didn't like my massages.
Phoebe, we are so proud of you! You're amazing!
No, I'll do it. You just stick to your job.
Y'know, I try to stay positive. . .
Great. So the ball is in his court?
Do you really see this as a long-term thing?
Sure, every time, you're such a princess...
Phoebe, you have a, a twig in your hair.
Oh, right, right. How was your date, 'Chand-lrr'?
I wanted it so bad! Wanna go pack?
Wait a minute. I thought last night was great.
Damnit Phoebe! How did you even call him?
Phoebe, he's gotta be in the room for that to work.
When Rachel was with Paulo, what did you do?
I don't know, I lost it all ok. I lost it.
Rach, there's something uh, important I have to tell you.
Hey, we're probably fertile, let's go home!
You know, that guy she met at the coffeehouse.
I'm still not done not wanting to talk to you.
Very good! What do you need it for anyway?
This is harder than I thought it would be.
What, what are you doing? You can't go out there.
Ohh, everybody at the restaurant still hates me.
Chandler, would you like some more orange juice?
Well y'know Joey, you're a pretty charming guy.
Man, I feel like I'm coming down with something.
Hey, at least I knew where my guy was.
You are insane! You-you gotta give this up!
We took a cab. Did you guys walk?
So we're gonna try? I mean, are we trying?
Still get a discount on wedding dresses?
You-you're gonna have to put your foot down?
The park huh? A public place.
Thank you. I think I just had a tiny orgasm.
OK, how does everybody like their burgers?
Oh, would you let it go already?! You're fine!
Hey, this afternoon you said you'd be supportive...
All right, Phoebe get open. Rachel, go long.
Have I read it? No, are you enjoying it?
Is this the one that I threw out last year?
Oh my god, honey, I'm so so so so so sorry.
What? Are you serious?! Joey smells gas!
Oh, thanks! We'll try to stop by.
Pick a number! That is your only job!
I've been great, just great. How have you been?
OK, if you say stop, then we stop.
He was so good in that movie of MacBeth.
Thank you for letting us see the house again.
Okay, stop it Phoebe, you're getting me all tingly.
Ooh, chocolates on the pillows! I love that!
Okay, let's go!! Let's hit the road!!
Ooh, candy bars, crossword puzzles...
You know what? Then, Joey, we want you to do it.
Because I put my head between her legs.
Come here. I can breath through my mouth.
Chandler one time wore my underwear to work!
Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't do this.
I don't want him to think that I'm having an affair.
Now I love you. And not just 'cause I have to.
Hey, it's Funny's cousin, Not Funny.
How does that laugh not give you a headache?
It's a traditional Mexican custard dessert.
Look, I wanted to tell I'm-I'm sorry you lost.
Four, please. I'm really nervous. Thank you.
You're not gonna be here New Year's Eve??
Ross, when's this comet thing start?
Hey! Maybe the monkey will be at the audition!
Oh, oh, okay umm, so I'll see you soon.
What are you guys doing? Oh my God, is that Richard?
We're really glad you decided to meet our guy.
Hey, it was very moving! You're just heartless!
Well I'm Monica Geller, ball like a baby.
All right, come on, I'm-I'm late for work!
Oh my God, Joey, that is such a great tip.
Is it better than the other salmon mousse?
I can cook and you can take care of the money.
Roger wants to take her out tomorrow night.
Ross, your little creatures got the remote again.
Because! You could get to live out my fantasy!
Hi Chandler. It's really nice to see you NOT.
Ok, it is definitely less than a ballpark.
That's true! I knew I married you for a reason!
Oh umm, I meant to tell you, Ross is coming.
Well, tonight was-was going to be my first time.
She doesn't have a stomach-ache. She's in labor!
It will not be fine. We'll get in trouble.
Ross! The neighbors ate all my candy!!
I mean think about all the money that you're gonna make!
So! I'm just an empty vase, huh?
Yeah, hi, it's Monica. I just got a page.
Oh yeah...So how did you end up kissing?
That's right, she came back all by herself.
Michael Flatley, Lord of the Dance!
Yeah, but y'know we could sneak in and watch.
Would you look at her? She is so peaceful.
If you tell me, I'll tell you what Phoebe said.
Chandler, I don't even wanna see the musical Oklahoma!
We don't do that! Tell her we don't do that!
Oh, wait, wait, wait! Here they go again.
All weekend? That's a whole lotta naked.
I didn't say your songs were not good enough.
Ross, how long have you been planning this wedding?
You only think it's stupid because you suck at it.
Oh, Janine, the really hot dancer girl?
Ok, three kinds of potatoes coming up.
Joey...he's not even thinking about going after Rachel!
The wedding is off, sloppy and immature!
Huh. What's doofus spelled backwards?
Well, then, I'm okay with being high maintenance.
Other wall, people! Other wall!
Hey! Umm, I think Brenda needs a raise.
This Thanksgiving kicks last Thanksgiving's ass!
Umm, okay. If it's a boy it's Daniel.
Yeah, I think I have some around here somewhere. Why?
Uhh, y'know actually I was gonna do some laundry.
Phoebe, there's a dog sitting on my couch!
Change! Okay, sit down. Two seconds.
Yeah! And the winner gets a hundred bucks.
Okay, umm, okay, umm... It's just Joey and Ross.
No, not if their room has two beds!
Well, what kind of food is he looking for?
I-I already told him everything! You shush!!
That's also like the tenth time you told us.
Oh my God! That's my restaurant, I'm the chef there.
What? So now I'm not allowed to fire him?
Danny. Are you guys ever gonna go out again?
Rachel, it's a world where Joey is a neuro-surgeon.
Why? Do you think he's still mad at us?
Oh no! You and Phoebe are gonna help me in here.
Boy, that was-that was, umm... terrific.
Guys. I thought you were taking Ross to the game?
Yeah, two hours, a lifetime that's the same.
Yeah you will! And, are you kiddin' me?!
That's different, we were roommates! And when?!
Wow! I can't believe I actually rolled an eight.
No!! You have been screwing us all day!
Oh God, is it 6:30? Buzz him in!
It's all everybody at the party could talk about!
No I didn't. I asked, "got the ke-eys?"
Base Unit! Think Monica! Think!
Phoebe! You kinda caught me at a bad time.
Stop with the broom, we're not making noise.
Child-birth, it's a natural thing! It's beautiful.
What is wrong with this freezer?! Ow! Ow!!
My parents spent the money for our wedding!
So what. So he drank a lot tonight.
It's a globe and, a pencil sharpener.
No! Joey, we swore we'd never tell!
Is he right? Am I really-Am I awful?
Oh, wait, is he the guy I met at Christmas?
: you don't think sharks are sexy do you?
Oh, I'm sorry. Shoot, they were doing it before.
Whose little ball of paper is this?!
Of course! Joey wouldn't let you have one?
Oh really? When? Do you wanna do it with me?
Okay. So what do you.... you think she's faking?
Gary's gonna ask you to move in with him!!
Well if you want a problem? I'll give you a problem!
Oh, about that. Joey, you have to change before the party.
Oh my god, where's Emma? Where's Emma?
Fresh cookies! Hot from the oven!
Hello? Hold on please. Joey, it's your mom.
All right, get your coat, we're going to the hospital.
Ross, you did not come up with "got milk?"
Phoebe, why is smoke coming out of the bathroom?!
No-no, Rachel, don't get it! He can't see us!
I know you're planning my surprise bridal shower.
Those are my eyes! Those are my breasts.
Oh my God! How cute is the on-call doctor?
Well, I guess we won't be warming his house.
Oh no, two days, you must be bummed.
Ohhh, ooohhh... you are on a roll, mister!
I think I'll help her out. What is going on here?
I'm sorry, I'm just excited about being an aunt!
We'd be eating our soup right now.
Hey! Didn't you have that outfit on last night?
That's it! Take it! Take it! Take it!
I think that is so great! When are you gonna ask her?
I haven't really settled on a spot yet!
So you stole that tape from Richard's apartment?
Oh good God, Ross! How the hell do you do it?
Wait a minute! My last Kit-Kat bar!
Oh wait, Joey, you can't go like that! You stink!
Sush!! I cannot believe she is still up there.
Oh no, she's out having drinks with Carl.
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god!
Yo, Bing. Racquetball in 15 minutes.
Ross you know that tonight is your date with Hillary?
Well, unless goose is a vegetable...ha haaaah!
I cannot believe you broke up with her just like that.
It's okay. Chandler, are you afraid of me or something?
Mm-mh. I printed them out on my computer.
Yes, they are. The Blymens invited them.
Wait a minute, I can get ice at the restaurant...
What if something gets broken, they're so expensive.
Yeah, yeah, and you were going him y'know, your flower.
So guys, listen, I go over there, and umm...
I mean, my feelings for Richard are certainly gone.
Yeah, but I'm the only one related by blood.
Oh. Monica! ...Hi. I'm Mo- ...nana.
Look. Joey, do you know we can see you from here?
Fantastic! I have one question: How is that possible?
Remember it? What do you think this is, a freckle?
Ya know, you had no right to go out with him.
Alright. I'm gonna go change, I've got a date.
I hadn't! Photo 152 was a prototype.
My God, you can't even look at me! Can you?
Well, her father pays you for baby-sitting right?
You know that? You don't want to spoil your appetite.
...horribly attractive. I'll be shutting up now.
This is the most special day of our lives.
Awww, look at Aunt Monica's little boy!
Yeah, I don't hear Chandler's and he doesn't hear mine.
Yeah you're right, we can't-we shouldn't watch this.
Besides, it takes the focus off the hat.
Wow, the boyfriend's parents! That's a big step.
Let's see, 1939... yeah, 24, 25?
It sure is nice to do this together, isn't it?
You know, it still smells like monkey in there.
Rache, I think we have enough regular lamps.
Hey, I've come to terms with it, you have to too.
Don't worry about it Phoebe, we'll absolutely do it.
Get up. Come on. Let's get some coffee.
I hope you cleaned your hair out of the drain.
I want you to know, it wasn't me who turned you in.
How did you know that?! Joey! Chandler!! It's time!
Oh, what are we gonna do! I don't wanna see her!!
O-kay, so you wanna play it that way, do you?
Ooh, are we allowed to lie in the vows?!
Oh, I was thinking about having people over for the game.
Oooh! They are in for a world of pain!
Y'know what? You're right Phoebe. You're right. Thank you!
You know what. Tomorrow I'm gonna do your clocks.
Hey Rach, could you get me some cough drops?
Joey, I thought you were gonna try to be friends first!
You mean the guy who kept calling you Ron?
I wanna wake up early and go get it for you!
Honey, I'm going to put my hand in your pocket!
You'd better hope I don't see you in the hallway!!
"To take you to his mansion in the sky-y?"
Phoebe, c'mere. I want to show you something in the bathroom.
No! We're gonna have fun. We can make fudge!
Oh damn the jellyfish. Damn all the jellyfish!
Sounds like she's got the ah, whole package.
No... Either of you girls got a quarter?
You jerk! You know how much I love that kid!
Well forget it! It doesn't hurt that baaad!!!!
Okay. Let us start with the A's. Advertising.
Hey. There you are. You disappeared after dinner.
No, Rachel never pees in public restrooms.
You're getting a crush on your sister's fiance.
Hey, are you ready to get back on the dance floor?
You've got to get back out there, it's your party.
: Yes! Chandler Watches Shark Porn!
Wow! I'm-I'm-I'm glad you smashed her watch!
All right, then show me some manly moves.
No. You know, sometimes just things doesn't work out.
Alright, Cincinnati, no blinds, everybody ante.
Because Armadillos also wandered in the desert?
I love the "I forgot the present" fake out!
That's the nicest anyone has ever said to me!
Well there's some people who do want to marry me.
That place in Vermont? You can take a hint!
That's my favourite kind! Okay, we are doing this!
Not a lot, Phoebe's kidding, Phoebe's crazy.
You know what? I'm not gonna be able to enjoy this.
We're supposed to meet my parents in 15 minutes.
What-what are you doing? Is this supposed to be funny?
Then why the hell are you dumping my brother?!?
You got a present for my parents. That's so sweet.
Chandler, that's like your fourth cup of coffee!
I'm Monica Geller. I've been taking care of you.
Y'know she has 147,000 pairs of boots...
Yes! Why, did you-you forget to make yours?
Did he give you that whole "You're-not-up-to-this" thing again?
Why are you talking about volcanoes all of the sudden?
Okay. God well, we gotta go back and get them!
I told you! I am not coming to a naked wedding!
Wow, he's really not letting this go, is he?
I know what you mean. You're like a sister to me too.
Quick, Phoebe, tell us before he can swallow.
Joey! He's working! You would look good in that.
Look Julio, someone left their book here.
Un, no you didn't! You must be mistaken!
Y'know what? I-I don't want a big, fancy wedding.
Yeah. You're just gonna have to stop pissing me off.
Oh I can't. Dr. Roger is coming over again.
Oh, I'm totally crazy, but you-you like the food?
Sweetie, we heard you crying. Please don't cry.
Chinese menu guy. Forgot the menus.
Hey, did you guys know, that your oven doesn't work?
Oh yeah, like I'm going to let you talk to the queen.
Okay! There you go! It's two tickets to Vegas!
Ross and I always wanted to be Donny and Marie.
Because Phoebe and Gary are in that-can't-keep-their-hands-off-each-other-doing-it-in-the-park phase!
It just makes more sense as an ensemble.
Chandler, do you think we talk about our relationship enough?
Okay. Right. Oh my God that is gonna be so hard.
That's not true, there are great pictures of us!
Did you ever, uh, like, think about the future?
Fine, so you don't like them. Everybody else does.
What are you talking about? We're all together right now.
How can I not do it? I have $127 in the bank.
Ohh! Fish, seaweed, a sunken ship.
Oh yeah, of course. I'm fine it's just that-
Yes I did, I'm Monica, Super Aunt.
Six? I just had it for one night. It's three.
Yeah, well you promised Barry, you'd marry him.
Yeah! That's why I'm sleeping with him on the side.
Oh, just so you know, you-you have to let him win.
They could be our neighbors, what are they like?
No! We only mess around at his place!
You don't mind me touching your belly, do you?
You bought the beach house when I was 23!
See yeah umm, you kinda stole my thunder!
Yeah, I couldn't be mad at him for too long.
I-I'm the head chef. I-I can't get promoted.
So, why don't you just take it back to where you got it?
All right, that's it, we're going to the emergency room.
I feel really sad that we're not...really there anymore.
I know! I'll tell you something, we are gonna do that again!
Yeah, Chandler... you've been there for five years.
No, no. It felt nice to acknowledge this.
Oh my God. You're even dumber than I am!
Damnit! Damnit!! Here's your fifty bucks!
I promise you, next time I will absolutely tell you.
You don't have a car. And your license expired.
But more importantly to full well-rounded lives.
Oh Will. But you-you've worked so hard...
It's okay! It's good! It's good. It's a disease!
Joey, why don't you put them in the lost and found?
Guys, you're a few steps ahead of us.
Oh I love taking limos when nobody died!
Hmm, I don't know. We really have to talk this through.
You go girl. I can't pull that off can I?
Yeah. Rach, are you thinking you're gonna make it to Vail?
Yeah, we named the boy Jack after dad.
Wow. Oh wow. You know I love you too, right.
Okay, so you were trying to play bad this whole time.
Dad, it is not. What's with the red light?
Yeah, because I hear the king is looking to adopt.
Hold on a second! What is that on her ankle?
Guys, please, I'm just gonna have dinner with him. Okay?
Oh, that is so sweet. Oh gosh, love you. Insurance?
I know! Phoebe is gonna love dressing them in these!
No, I want everything that you just said. I want a marriage.
Was he wearing a stunning blue suit?
I just told Rachel that Roy touched my boob.
I can't believe her, y'know it's just-it's so typical.
C'mon give me five more. Five more.
All right! You and me! Let's go! Right now!
You broke up with a girl because she was fat?!
Hey, how are you feelin'? Any morning sickness?
Ditch you? Phoebe, you were pregnant with the triplets!
Oh that's a great idea. You're really good on the phone.
Y'know, I love doing crossword puzzles with you honey!
Ah-ah-ah, now you started this, you will finish it.
Oh-oh, no no don't worry, I'm gonna wash it.
Whatever keeps you off the balcony, big guy!
Look, I am not high maintenance. I am not. Chandler!
Not that bad? Did you hear the hammer story?
Here, let me make the milk, I'm up anyway.
You're really sticking with the shell necklace huh?
Oh that's too bad. It's true, but too bad.
Don't get too attached, she's having it cremated.
Limited seating?! I am just one tiny person!
I meant, why don't you take Richard to the game? What?
I know, how can you not be accross the hall anymore.
Who's Gladys? Oh! What a tragic loss!
Oh my God Rach. Bean bag chairs.
Oh my God, what would have done if I said yes?
No, I think that this is what you wanna do, I think it's great!
And what are you laughing at, Miss `My-keg-sucking-boyfriend-is-stealing-from-me!'
Well, it's a set and they should probably stay together.
All right, just trying to start an interesting discussion.
Chris says they're closing down the bar.
Y'know, maybe it's best that we never got to do it again.
See, now this is why I keep notepads everywhere.
Alright, you know what? That's it. You've had your chance.
I don't know exactly. It's-it's sorta like wrestling.
No! Rachel, you didn't find anyone so you can't tell him.
I've never loved anybody as much as I love you.
Doing great, the quiches are coming along.
I don't want her to get a boob job! That's crazy!
'Cause I don't want to encourage this kind of behaviour.
It's some of Richard's hair! What do I do with this?
Rachel, you say you're sorry or your sweater gets it.
You know, it's a really funny story how this happened.
Rachel, it's going to happen. Chandler is gonna move in here.
Chandler! He's your father; he should be at the wedding.
No! You are not gonna run out and leave her here!
They tore it down a few days early.
He probably wants you back because you're right for the job.
Ohh, I'm sorry I couldn't think of anymore for Ross!
No, actually, we're buying the house next door.
No you learn these things. You grow into it.
Y'know, there's a Starbucks about three blocks down.
How about we play for more money, say 150?
...Oh! I-I see you moved the green ottoman.
So are you thinking of starting up something with this guy?
Oh, I can't. We're throwing Phoebe a bachelorette party.
Well Joey, we're all...we're all very proud of you.
I'm in love too! But in an orderly fashion.
All right then, your bra would still be big.
Oh, my goodness, they've all gotten so big!
I have you scheduled for nudity at 2300 hours.
Hey Frannie, welcome back! How was Florida?
Rachel, listen to your mother. She is very smart.
Oh, they're brochures from different adoption agencies.
I gotta tell ya, I think it's okay to be that guy.
Why does my cinamon stick have an eraser?
He's in a different room! He's really that loud?
You are so cute! How did you get to be so cute?
: Im very, very drunk right now.
You remember that video I found of mom and dad?
Uch. I am still so mad at you for smoking.
BECAUSE OF OUR MEDDLING! Alright?
Eh... Heart Disease, Alzheimers, gout?
Sweetie! Edges! Fingers! Smudgey! Pictures!
So, uh, have you ever thought about being there for her?
She was like 30, dark hair, attractive.
Are, are you okay? I mean, do you want me to stay?
Hey, Rach, can you give me a hand with this box?
Oh my God, what a fun day! That sounds great!
I can't believe mom and dad are selling the house!
I don't know. I guess the other people just don't care enough.
No, no, don't get it. Let the machine pick up.
We forgot to sign one of the admissions forms.
You said your boss wants to buy your baby?!
Well, you-you coulda just turned the cushion over.
All right, biggest suite in the place. Come on!
The game's over! Take off your robe!
It's unbelievable! I-I can't believe that sign didn't work!
Shut up, the camera adds ten pounds.
What? I-I bought groceries, I was gonna make you dinner!
Oh yeah? Ok, let's settle this, come on!
Y'know they say a watched pot never beeps.
Joey, please come. It would mean so much to us.
I can't believe this is taking so long. How are you doing?
Uh well that depends, how are things with Phoebe?
Phoebe and Gary are so gonna hear about this at dinner.
There's nothing we can do. You erased the message!
Yeah! Hey! Thanks for getting me that girl's number.
No Mom, I don't have a restaurant, I work in a restaurant.
Rachel! Rachel! You haven't touched Eldad's hair!
I can't believe they called, and we're actually getting a baby.
Joey, take your time with that. That's my last batch.
Oh, relinquish is just a fancy word for lose!
Not just the phone pen. I never get my messages.
No reason. I-I keep private things in there.
Excuse me? He doesn't even know what he's doing!
Hey Phoebe... how you doin'? You feelin' better?
Easy Rach, we'll find it. Won't we!
Nothing. I just think it's nice when we're all here together.
Ross hasn't worked at the museum for a year!
Where is everybody? They're forty-five minutes late!
Chandler, stop! It is not going to pop open!
Oh, come on it's my wedding! That can be my present.
Oh, so you finally took it out of the marina huh?
No, but he told me, he thinks your a fox.
Well, no. But, um, I bet she probably does.
Oh, and you know who's selling a great apartment? Richard!
All right umm, a string quartet for the procession.
Rach, I know her pretty well, can I go? That's fine.
All right, I've heard enough. I've made my decision.
Well, if you want, you can stay with Rachel and me tonight.
Ok, it's 2100 hours. Time for your toast.
Okay! But you can't rip it. Well, maybe a little.
You and Mona are doing a holiday card together?
Yes, but you cannot tell anyone! No one knows!
He's seeing someone. I can't believe he's seeing someone.
I have no idea. But look how much they spent!
Relax, she-she's gonna give in way before you do!
That kid really kicked me hard on the plane.
Okay. I can do that. I gotta go powder my ass.
Yeah. And y'know, if you wanna cry, that's okay too.
Ross, we're kind of in the middle of diner here.
When you get a sec, another round of daiquiris.
Hey, where is this guy, it's been over an hour!
Do you think they recognize each other from in there?
First, I need a boyfriend, then I can have a list.
It needs to go about 20 blocks to the left!
I can not see him? I mean, you can't tell me what to do!
I don't know what to say. We shouldn't have lied to you.
Wait Chandler come on, let's-it's not a big deal!
I got offered the head chef job at Allesandro's.
Yeah, you can hear everything through these stupid walls.
I kind of have to don't I? Because of this stupid thing.
Oh well, maybe we can put it in the guest bedroom.
Relax, Ross. She's not made of ice cream!
Okay, here's your milk. What do you want to talk about?
Hey, where are all my ovulation-sticks? There's only one here.
No Phoebe, those are like the side affects and stuff.
Honey, the question is...do you really want to marry Joey?
One hour? You are such a leaf blower.
You're still so funny. You're so funny. What do I do?
Now, these are-are more realistic, but perishable.
Joey! Why is Janine not coming over for dinner?!
Why don't I just take off my clothes and have a nightmare.
Where are you guys going? Come on, one more game!
This is amazing. I mean, how, how did this happen?
Hey, cheer up! You're gonna see her again, right?
Well, that was weird. You were loud, and I was fast.
Is that, is that what they call strippers sometimes?
Oh, Joey, please tell me you're only donating your time.
Oh. Well then way to go you big movie star!
Yeah, I've had them picked out since I was fourteen.
Oh really? Okay, let's compare, shall we.
Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please?
Hey Hon, could you help me get the plates down?
This is so great! And I'm gonna be your baby's aunt!
No, it's not a sign! It's a very old key!
Uh, Chandler did! What does he want you to give up?
Wow, she must have hurt you pretty bad, huh?
This is what happens when you don't register for gifts!
Believe me, that is not why we won't be doing that!
Whoa whoa whoa! Where're you goin'?
Okay, I got my note cards. Do you got the presents?
Thank you. Rachel, can I talk to you outside for a sec?
Listen Rachel, I feel really bad about-What are you doing?
I know... it's just... I thought this was, you know... it.
Alright that's great, then just go. Go Knicks.
You cried yesterday at the six o'clock news.
Uh, Aunt Iris? This is Phoebe, and that's Rachel...
Yeah, we used to perform for our family and friends.
I'm quitting!! Woo-hoo! I'm okay!! I'm all right!!
Oh my God! My God! We've got the house !?
To score the winning touchdown, by the way.
No honey, I'm sorry, but the weekend's not over yet.
Close? She's got her tongue in his ear.
Hi! Hey, Pete you're back! Hey, check this out.
Hey, guys. I'm here to pick out my Christmas tree.
I'm also thinking about opening up my own restaurant.
Ok, hypothetically, why won't I be married when I'm 40?
Hey-hey, how goes the dancing? Gay yet?
Okay, count to three. 1. 2. 3!
I can't believe this! This is like the worst night ever!
Oh she misunderstood, she thought she was moving to Tulsa.
Ok, there's enthusiastic and there's just plain gay!!
Thank you. Come meet my friends. This is uh, Phoebe.
Okay, Joey's gonna catch it, and you and I are gonna block.
So Don, what-what other restaurants do you like?
Of course not nothing is. Between me and you...
Oh that's right, that's what I'd sound like if I exploded.
Oh Joey, Melanie called, said she's gonna be late.
'....Won't you, won't you, won't you.... '
You bet your ass, I'm gonna fire you! Thank you.
Phoebe why don't you just call her? You obviously want to.
So is it horrible? Is everybody working really hard?
Wow! Your lip went bald. Hey, thanks.
Why would someone do that?! ...One might wonder.
He's not gonna say anything, because we're not gonna tell him.
Do not start without me. Do not start without me.
Why? It's not like I'm putting little nipples on them.
Well, sure, what with it being her funeral and all.
I can't believe it's raining again! Oh, it's so unfair!!!
Chandler! You don't have to ask for my permission. You can go.
Who did we fight in World War I?
No, he's picking up dinner, why, what's up?
Wow! So, now you're going on a date with this girl?
Are you gonna break up with me if I get fat again?
I'd like a scotch on the rocks with a twist.
Count in our heads as-as good Madlibs.
I'll pick you up at eleven. So glad you're coming.
Wait a minute, they're making you take time off work?
But it didn't. Say hello to Mrs. Chatracus.
Do you still wanna call 'em? I wanna call 'em.
Nobody wants to do it? All right, I'll do it myself.
Okay, Joey's doing the ceremony and Chandler's giving you away.
It is going to be okay! It was worth a shot.
Is he doing his shark attack bit yet?
Oh! Enough! A monkey could have made 'em!
What are you doing?! Chandler! You can't just go back a phase!
Can I ask you just a little question, huh? Why tonight?
If you really want to watch that Serengetti thing, you can.
All right, half the people. I mean, just try it and see.
That could be a four or a five. It's your call.
No it's not! You want it, you're gonna have to win it!
Yeah. We-we had sex and then we fell asleep.
Okay, I-I d'know, you-you just- you have a quality.
So maybe they could umm, call the award the Monica?
So you're gonna be gone four days a week? No.
We're really sorry, but um, she did ask us first.
A small puff of air, now come on!
You're-you're-you're gonna bring the Barca Lounger over here?
My dad told me. They play golf together.
Oh my God, I love how thin these walls are!
You're from Yonkers! Your last name is Buffo-Martisis!
Well, I love it. I only hope my wedding looks this good.
Calling Dr. Big, Dr. Big to the bed.
Oh God, oh God, I am sorry... I am so sorry...
And I suppose you used a ring designer for that.
And about an hour ago, we made an offer.
Oh God... Why don't they put chairs back here?!
All right, I still need a calamari and a Caesar salad.
Wow! I Had no idea you had this much pride.
I'm gonna go across the hall to check on the yams.
Oh, god... She's told you that already, didn't she?!
Oh my God, this man is gonna get naked in my apartment!
I didn't mean to cut it off. It was an accident.
Well, we-we had to go back because I forget my jacket.
Don't worry. You'll find some place to get married.
I can't just walk away! I've put in four hours!
No, but that's probably 'cause I haven't asked them yet.
Don't feel bad for me! I won like every time!
Ross, is he gonna live with you, like, in your apartment?
Hey dad, what's up? Oh God. Ross, it's Nana.
Well that's the best part. Umm, you guys get to decide!
Hey, we could have used that kind of thinkin' earlier.
The waiter carried the breadsticks in his pants!
Well, I want he baby to come out all cute and fat!
Oh, when you get over this breakup we need to go shopping.
That's sounds great, but how are you going to afford it?
Oh, can I borrow this? My milk's gone bad.
This is it. Yeah, this is the one. I can't believe I found it!
Ok, thanks for coming, I hope you guys had fun.
Why are you reading this? You hate this kind of stuff.
Uhm the... the ministry... of names... bureau...
Oh, of course, it's so nice to see you again, Zack!
I... I'm sorry, who should be along in a what now?
Do you guys know what happened to Chandler's barca lounger?
Dad, dad. We got it!! We Got It!!!
Oh my God, oh my God. Call me on the phone!
Now come on. Well, I'm glad we worked things out.
So, how about you huh? How do you know the happy couple?
This is different! Greg and Jenny are in a relationship.
Are you sure he didn't break it because it really hurts.
Well if-if that's what it is, then it's-it's crazy.
He would just roll me over and I would stop snoring.
Hey, Rach, you're leaving tomorrow, shouldn't you be packing?
Honey, we don't really have to go to this thing tonight do we?
Joey, stop hitting on her! It's her wedding day!
I tried to reach you at work. There's....been a fire.
Honey, listen... You have nothing to worry about with Geoffrey.
Oh, wow, can you believe you're like three weeks away?
I know! Hey, you haven't been practising the routine, have you?
Are you okay? You've been acting weird all afternoon.
Honey, you're just in time, I'm about to sing another song!
I don't know. Rachel I'm-I'm sorry that I hurt your ankles.
She doesn't have a stomach ache, she's in labor.
Wendy? -- That sounds like a girl's name.
No, I have just to have two more points to beat him!
Well, I'd like to but, I'm not sure we have time to go.
Rachel! What is your cat doing in one of my bowls!
He's coming. Be cool, be cool, be cool.
I just talked to Joey, I just-I want to see how you were.
What's the matter, officer? Has someone been bad?
Why do you guys have so many keys in there anyway?
Do you think breaking up with him was a huge mistake?
My pink flowered bra! I recognize the strap!
No, umm, he met some girl at the coffee house.
Okay, Mike and Joey, get in position. Chandler, come with me.
Come on, was it somebody maybe you dated in college?
Do you really think marrying someone else is the right answer?
Please. Half the guys out there have makeup on.
Ohh, you are such a good boss! Is she pretty?
What?..... What, you wanna spell it out with noodles?
Phoebe? Oh, Phoebe, I'm so sorry. Have you been here long?
Apparently you were umm, a little mean to him in high school.
Go on, teach me something about men and women.
Oh please, he didn't hear it! He didn't hear it!!
But Ben is coming over tonight and he can't see this.
Please, it's a relief is what it is, is what it is.
What kind of social situation are you comfortable with?
Ah no, the other Phoebe, the one you went to go see.
I just told my Mom I'd cater a party for her.
Oh my God! Ohh! Look at this one! It's so beautiful!
Mail call, Rachel Green, bunk seven.
I-I don't-I don't think that I'm gonna wear the boots tonight.
He took up the carpet, and now you can hear everything.
Wait a minute, who told you? You are dead meat.
Ok, thank you. Uh, well this is it. Are you OK?
Ohh! Did you do what I said? Did-did-did you tell her?
All right, umm, we're not gonna really keep it this way though.
The ones we had right after you almost threw up.
Oh, we weren't talking about you. No, no way to recover.
Dad! There's Ross , why don't you go talk to him?
Okay, so how do I make him think I wanna have sex with him?
Look, here's a picture of Scotty Jared naked.
Rach! We weren't gonna miss our friends getting married!
The big hat, the pearls, the little pick handbag.
She's not pregnant. It's Rachel. Rachel's the one who's pregnant.
Okay, wait, you gotta hang up 'cause we're gonna be late.
'Fraid so. Brown hair, green eyes...
See, didn't I tell you?! You're getting over Ross already!
Mom! Dad! Ross smoked pot in college!
Hey, guys, what-what should I wear to a Knicks game?
Phoebe, do you want to go see a movie after dinner tonight?
OK, we got the cole slaw, we got the buns...
Those cute little black ones I wear all the time.
No! Are you doing it?! I don't hear anything! Come on!
So, why wait 'til Saturday, are you free tomorrow?
Awww, y'know what your nickname is, Mr. Big...
Chandler, we said we would meet at the coffeehouse at six.
Hey Joey, Chandler sold a story to Archie Comics!
What happened? You still have the Monica wedding fund don't you?
Oh my God, you can't even see where the Titanic hit it.
Wait. He pooped in my shoe? Which one?
Well, um, because mainly, um, they don't like you. I'm sorry.
Can we have our drinks please?! Waiter-Uh, tress!
Hmm, well you're around me all the time and you don't flirt.
Come on guys! Let's go! Come on, it's second down.
Well that is great. And seriously, she seems very nice.
Thanks, I'm set. Do you still live with your parents?
I'll bet he's totally over me, I'll bet he's fine.
Why?! Why? Why, why would anybody do something like that?
You just put an empty carton back in the fridge!
Well you look incredible too! You're just-you're so fit!
Oh hi! Hi! Y'know, we were just talking about bacon.
How are we gonna get home? Maybe a piggy-back ride?
Yeah, I changed them. I-I sent you a fax about it!
Y'know dad, Chandler is one of Ross's very best friends!
Hey, I have all the space I need. Just do what I did.
Yes smokie, that is what it was. I just can't get enough.
Oh my God! Well push it in! Push it in!
I hope you're not full, 'cause dinner's almost ready.
Okay, so from now on we have to call you Princess Consuela?
If it is a new message, what is he calling to say?
I don't care. Oh my god. I've lost the will to scold.
I can't believe he has a new roommate. Who is this guy?
He is so cute. So, where did you guys grow up?
Woah, woah, woah, let's go back to 29.
Hey, I made $17 before breakfast, what have you done?
Hard 8?! We should call it easy 8!
Oh my God! He just said my name! Did you hear that?
Well, I was going for wrong, but we can use your word.
Wow! It took you all night to come up with that plan?!
Don't worry, after a while he'll tune it out.
Oh yeah that's what you want - my inhibitions lowered.
Because he'll know what to do? Oh my God, you're a genius!
I need more swordfish. Can you get me some more swordfish?
Ooh, what'cha gonna do, fat boy, huh? What?
Joey, you're this guy's teacher. I mean how could you do this?
I wish I could say the same. I'm a little shook up!
No, wait, please don't go! I've got porn for you too!
Well...it's just umm...I'm afraid you might mess it up.
Well, we don't really have to decide anything right now, do we?
Did it ever occur to you that I might just be that stupid?
Chandler, look I-I know that your dad embarrassed you. I know...
So Phoebe, why are there men's shoes by the door.
Ooh, umm, oh Kathy! Kathy, I love you! Oh!
You can also find him under umm, dog and dead.
What is it? Is there something fundamentally unmarriable about me?
Oh my god, little Stevie Fisher? How've you been?
In that cute, little, sweet way she just did?
Oh, I wish I didn't have to wait to take a pregnancy test.
I can't believe you tried to cut me out. Why Phoebe, why?
Upstairs in the bathroom right before you felt up mom.
I'm sorry, they surprised me. There was nothing I could do!
Huh? What'd ya say Joe? I'll be right there.
You were staring about eight inches south of there.
Okay, Rachel, you wanna put the marshmellows in concentric circles.
There are no jobs. There are no jobs for me.
All right, sweetie that's fine. You didn't do it on purpose.
Thank you. All right, now who else do you want to invite?
So it looks like it's going really well for you two, huh?
Yeah? What does she think of your little science project?
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I-I should probably leave you girls alone.
You have got to get over this. You're not gonna end up alone.
Look look! He's doing it again, the guy with the telescope!
So I, I told Rachel it was just gonna be the two of us.
If only there were a smaller one to clean this one!
Of course we will, come on we gotta make dinner.
What do I smell? I smell smoke. Huh-did you smoke?
It's not Richard! Okay? It's this new guy and he's really good.
Oh my God, I went to high school with her. Rachel! Hi!
: yeah he has to stay in Tulsa this weekend.
Well, y'know it's none of my business, but aren't you married?
Well, he's my parents' best friend, he has to be there.
You just wanna stay home so you can make a move on Joey!
Alright, I've got a leg, three breasts and a wing.
I wanted to do this days ago so I think I should go first.
William Sonoma, fall catalog, Page 27.
Okay, have you considered using a girl with huge knockers?
That's a great idea! I was saving them for something special.
Well, that's okay dad, we-we can wait until later.
Okay? Ooo wee! Christmas party in my boots!
Wow! For just a week you guys are really close, huh?
Alright, I'm gonna go pick up a few things for the trip.
Now, are you glad we didn't start with the bikini strips?
That didn't work on mom, it's not going to work on us.
Wait a minute, she isn't... She's not the one who you...
Wait wait! I can't sing in front of all these people.
And make sure our room isn't next to theirs .
You guys, Joey just saw Janice kissing her ex-husband.
Hi, welcome home. I need to borrow a hundred bucks.
Umm, wait! Do you want to set the mood a little?
I'm gonna go to the bathroom, maybe I'll see you there in a bit?
Yeah, I'm going to take a bath. I'm just going to get a magazine.
Oh god, waddawe do, waddawe do, waddawe do?
I just thought it would be nice if I could have just this one night!
Did you ever go out with a guy your friends all really like?
Joey, she was listing the countries she's done it in.
No you're fine. All right well, do you think I could take Rachel?
Ohhh, oh my God! Oh my God! She knows about us!
Oh, that's there on the bottom, see the manager, Chandler Bing.
No, no, no, no, no, no pressure, no pressure!
Okay, well, why don't we all meet upstairs in an hour?
Well, it's done about two minutes before it looks like that.
Congratulations! Wow! I can't believe you're nominated for an Emmy!
Joey is gonna be a celebrity guest on a game show!
Yeah, we all have jobs. See, that's how we buy stuff.
Well, you used to dress up in Mom's clothes all the time.
Yeah... yeah, I think there is. -What were you gonna say?
Oh honey, is that 'cause your Mom died around Christmas?
Why don't you just be straight with her? Tell her the truth.
Ha ha, a joke that's funny in all countries.
Uh- Rachel has left the building, can you call back?
But that's clearly a joke. This could easily be true.
Hi! Umm, I'm Monica Geller, I'm the chef at Alessandro's.
I'll take it down to 95% but that's the best I can do.
I'll meet somone else. There'll be other Alans.
Why don't you come over tonight? And I'll make you favorite dinner.
Okay, you can not tell Chandler. Okay? That I ran into Richard.
Because you're on my team! And my team always wins!
Spend more time with the tie. That'll make a baby.
I'm Monica Gellar. Who do you know the bride and groom?
Nope. Going to the Big Apple Circus today.
I arranged some pillows on the bed to look like a guy.
He's not boring! He's just-he's just low key.
I know, but what are we gonna do? She really needs this job.
Well, if it annoys you so much, then why do you do it?
Ross married Rachel in Vegas! And got divorced! Again!!!!
That's right! You lose sucker!! Please still marry me.
No, nononono.. it's just.. things change. People change.
Oh God bless my dad sound proofing the basement!
There's nothing to tell! He's just some guy I work with!
Does Ralph mumble when you're not paying attention?
There's a pregnant woman in Ohio, and she picked us!
Oh, not at all. I have no morals and I need the cash.
Thanks, that would be great. Hey, honey, wouldn't that be great?
You know what this is, this is us getting ready for the prom.
Are you nuts?! We've got George Stephanopoulos' pizza!
Now? Is it okay if I go out with Chip Matthews?
Hey, Rache. You know what we haven't played in a while?
Ohmygod! Rat baby! Rat baby! Rat baby!
That does not mean you know us better, I-I want a rematch.
Okay, great! Bye. So guess who's coming to Thanksgiving dinner?
Because there are so many terrible sights in this world.
It's on us, all right, so don't worry. It's our treat.
All right baby, come on! Yes! Yes! I am on fire!
Oh my god, Joey, for all we know this guy could be horribly...
Can you believe it? I finally get to run my own kitchen!
Oh yeah, well there's the possibility that I won't make rent.
And that's why, I'm not inviting you in for a drink. Bye.
Ross, we haven't done the routine since middle school.
Okay! Okay! We can take a hint! What are you doing here?!
This is so cool, maybe this is something you can do every week.
How could I be asleep knowing that you were in the next room.
Matt Guire, Mark Lynn, Ben Wire...
Here's Frannie. Hmm, won't she be happy to see me?
Gosh, doesn't it seem like a million years ago?
No, please don't. Please, Joey. She will kill us!
Oh wait! You didn't just sit on my Kit-Kats did you?!!
Even Mary Tyler Moore would've been better.
What are you talking about?! 007 has all those gadgets!
As a thank you, Rachel and I will kiss for one minute.
I'm fine, just a little tired, I'm okay. How's Richard doing?
Honey, it's not pushy, he gave her his home number.
He's with Emily at a Bed and Breakfast in Vermont!
No. You don't have any of these cute little obsessive things.
Phoebe, they didn't make you pay for those knives, did they?
Nothing, just never seen you in little stretchy pants before.
Twenty bucks says they're married within the month.
Okay, let's do it. Mom and Dad are gonna be so faced!
Wait a minute! We're talking about someone that I'm going out with?
Wow. Then I would definitely not recommend Mrs. Doubtfire.
Wait, what that place, that pub he took us too?
Oh, I can't wait for everyone at work to see these... Ow!
Hey, have you figured out a way to tell him you're moving out?
Okay, let's start with the free messages outside the UN.
Well actually, I-I didn't eat mine. It's still in the bathroom.
And well, we probably shouldn't see each other anymore. I'm sorry.
Phoebe, do you think that your favorite animal says much about you?
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You know what, the way you did it was just fine.
What are you, animals? It's 4 o'clock in the afternoon!
Chandler, we still haven't gotten an RSVP from your dad.
That's right. Get it out of your system while we're alone.
You promised Dr. Weinburg, you'd never use that phrase.
No, he'll be fine. It's the other five I'm worried about.
I know, after you left the store, I chose different ones.
Chandler, you're an only child, right? You don't have any of this.
Yes you are! That's the only way to explain all this stuff!
Run, Marcel, run! Run, Marcel! Are you okay?
Ohh, sweetie! Hey, I bet you anything that he's gonna call you again.
Honey, if you know it through a wall, you know it too well!
Alright, great. Thanks a lot. I'm going to tap class.
I think, that if you really like this guy, you should just trust him.
No fair. I don't even have one. How come they get two?
I guess that makes sense. So, you think you're going to talk to him?
What are you doing here? I thought you had to do inventory all day.
Excuse me, umm, can I talk to you over here for just a second?
I know it's last minute, but we decided to have a Halloween party.
You know how much I love listening to your music, you know, but...
Oh, is it that pinball machine with the big bow on it?
Wow! It's really red! You should go see my eye doctor.
I'm sorry, I didn't know to look for Chinese food on the floor.
It's only been a couple of hours, so just give it some time.
This isn't how it's supposed to go, there can't be another guy.
Pretty much. So, what do you, what do you think of the floor?
... that she was the huge guy that mugged you? Yah.
Phoebe, don't worry about it. I'm sure she wants to live with you.
Honey, that's a great idea nailing the boxes to the floor!
Rach, you know that birthing tape you wanted to see? It's here.
So, did you come by to watch us win the big bucks?
If-if-if we ever did what you did a man would never call.
Hey, guys, guys, did you see my new, china cabinet?!
Who? Who do you know that are friends that just fool around?
These tiny, little non-breasts?! Please, it's gotta be Rachel.
Okay, okay. You two go get the dessert. And I'll let you in.
Get in there man! Flirt back, mix it up!
Three down knows I'm married, what's three down doin'?
I'm sorry honey, but we're gonna take you shopping. It's gonna be fine.
I've got a question. Richard made plans again with the guys.
I have been looking for them all week and she is wearing them!
I won't care, because I know you will be feeling it all in here.
Stop it. Stop! Okay let's go. We can be strong.
I personally would be honored if she wanted to live with me.
Okay.. Well, I'm going out with a guy my friends all really like.
Aw, I'm sorry sweetie that she doesn't feel the same way.
Oh Rachel, I know the best coffee house and it's sooo close.
Good. Uh honey, the Miami Vice soundtrack? Really?
All right, I'll do it just this once! But you can't tell anybody!
See now-now you're taking them away from their home.
Yeah. Run ten blocks, that'll help the smell.
I eat by myself in the alley because everybody hates me.
Is he really coming? Because I can see right into your apartment!
Mr. Bigot. He tells the most racist jokes.
You know what, I think it's cute, you trying to be more like Richard.
Oh, good to see you too. Did you come down here to tell me that?
We know how tough those parent/teacher conferences can be.
Wait a minute! Now I'm betting against all three of you?
Do you want to go to the bathroom, or do you wanna play poker?
Look umm, of all people, you do not want me to tell this story!
Alright . I think it's a big mistake but it's your decision.
Maybe she will. Uh! Why couldn't I have been a Reverend?
Quick, take off your dress, he won't notice the bed.
Wow! And around the ankles, y'know that is a tough spot.
Hey, they don't pay me a penny a word to make friends.
Did you ever feel like sometimes you are just so unbelievably uncoordinated?
Oh wait, Chandler, come here is there anything I can do? Anything?
Or if you want to kiss him, umm, you could use mistletoe.
I gotta go to work. Has anybody seen my left boob?
For the sixteenth time, no... I do not think you're obsessive.
Oh my God! Ross, are you in England? Was Emily surprised?
I can't believe you thought I was cheating. You own me an apology.
On three, 1...2...3! Now my pillow's all wet!
I love it! It's huge!! Let's open it! Open it!!
I know why do you think he was so worried about me getting bigger?
Ok, so you've done some good work! What about your carry-ons?
I'm sure everything's fine. Has her water broke yet?
Maybe. I just hope she realizes how hard it's gonna be.
Okay, what if the person who adopts the other one is horrible?
Two? TWO? How is that possible? I mean, have you seen you?
That was some hot love you gave me! I'm gonna go get ready.
Hey! Where 'ya headin' in those pants? 1982?
You guys are dead, I am so good at lighting rounds.
What?! Are you crazy?! I'm not getting married! I'm not even engaged.
I said that you had a nice butt, it's just not a great butt.
Well thank God you were here! I mean, we have to erase that!
I knew it!! Y'know, you're not so quiet yourself, missy!
That's what you've been working on for the past two hours?!
We'll be right there! Can't you just say it starts later?
Phoebe, you do seem a little tense. Here, let me help you.
Well, I guess we've established who's staying here with Monica...
It's never taken you more than a shower to get over a relationship.
Is anyone thankful for anything else besides a thong?
Maybe a Hello Kitty doll, the ability to walk...
Who has her own little desk when Roland's not there.
Tell them I'm a chef in a big New York restaurant!
I swear I've seen birds do this on Wild Kingdom.
Well you can't! We're booked solid for the next month!
It's okay, 'cause y'know what? You don't really need me for the business.
Hi! Can you do that and walk? 'Cause she said, "Next."
My God! Chandler, we said be 'aloof' not 'a doof'.
Okay. Let's hurry-Oh wait! Do we have a condom? Oh right!
What-what's the matter? Is there, is there something on my dress?
Oooh, I wish she could stay here, but Chandler is allergic!
Well, the good news is, I don't think anyone's looking at us.
Well, if you don't have anything to copy, why are you going down there?
You ordered a stripper for the shower?! That is totally inappropriate!
Are you kidding me?! Is this; is this turning you on?
That guy stood on your neck until you passed out!
You go back out there and you seduce her till she cracks!
It's wrong. You know what else is wrong? Phoebe picking Rachel.
This woman's got my life, I should get to see who she is.
All right, just give it back to me when your done. See you guys.
Y'know what? I-I think that umm, I don't feel like going to The Plaza.
Hey, don't mix those up, you could really ruin that lollipop.
Is that the one that speaks English or the one that doesn't?
You are so handsome! I wanna make love to you right here, right now!
Pleased to meet you. So you're coming to Rachel's party tonight?
Oh please! Did you hear that? Little drops of heaven.
I'm gonna go tell Joey that that you're back. I was really worried about you.
Well it wasn't my fault, Phoebe was in charge of the invitations!
No, but someone's really not going to get over that idea, are they?
Sweetie okay. It's okay. Everybody made it to the wedding. I'm fine.
That's my old dog. He passed away years ago.
With that moustache doesn't Chandler remind you of Aunt Sylvia?
Joe... Emus are birds. You raise them for meat.
Hello? What?! You what?! Hey you listen here missy! Wh-
Welcome home. I've missed you. join me in the bedroom?
Oh good God! If you want a baby so bad just go steal it!
No-no-no, don't-don't do the accent. You've got to see her again.
Well, I know that would make Joey happy, so, I would like that too.
All right, were you guys smoking something in the back of our van?
Ohh! Ohhhh! Were you sleeping sweetie? I'm sorry. Here.
Phoebe, we're getting married, married; not sixth grade married.
'A Woman Undone, by Rachel Karen Green'.
No, the one who looked at you once because you got in her way.
It was a project for one of the Home Ec classes.
I can't live like this! What are we gonna do? What are we gonna do?
No, you don't want this. I want to have your grandmother's cookie recipe.
Okay, so what do you, what do you want to do? Let's do something crazy!
Oh, okay. Alright, it's flight 421. Leaves at 8:40.
Uh yeah, I-I actually I thought about you a couple months ago.
Of course you can look at it! Yeah, I want your opinion too!
Yes, I'm sure! Rachel is there something that you want to talk me about?
I love how it crumbles. Now see, your chocolate doesn't do that.
You must feel horrible. Hey! The guys have free porn!
How can that be?! Oh wait! Wait! Are you, are you serious?!
Absolutely! It would just be one friend helping out another friend.
Joey, please don't do that. I think it's best that we just forget about it.
All right, I'm gonna go to work. Does anybody have a problem with that?
Do you want some shortbread? Eh that's Scottish like you are.
Oh wow wow wow!! Make room for your friend!
Chandler, relax it's not a contest. Certainly not a close one.
What, Phoebe, did you whip the potatoes? Ross needs lumps!
Great! We're hangin' in the kitchen! Let's stay in the kitchen!
I guess you can get back to deciding on what to get me for a present!
Okay, I've got some Ones, you wanna put them in her panties?
You know, if you just wait another... six and a half minutes...
Nobody move! Okay, you look that way; I'll look this way!
Alright, we don't know that it's him. I mean, it could be the football guy.
Hey, do you realize that at this time tomorrow we'll be getting married?
Phoebe! Come on I'm serious! I just got to talk to him about all this.
Well, maybe you could give to somebody else. Ooh, like Ross Geller.
Y'know, I don't like to brag about it, but I give the best massages!
Bye bye Mike!/Cya mike!/Bye mike!/Bye bye now!
Ohh... that wouldn't by any chance be... Joey Tribbiani?
Mom, uh, Chandler was just saying how beautiful your sweater is.
Where were you? We were supposed to meet in the wine cellar?
Ross this is the only thing left that has a shot at working.
So. Welcome. Is this your first time you're seeing Emma?
Oh my gosh! Rachel, honey.. are you okay? Where-where's Paolo?
Hey guys check it out! My mom sent me the paper!
Yeah. It's my dad's birthday, I decided to give him a stroke.
I missed you-you ugly, flat faced old freak!
Wait, Joey! Joey! That doesn't mean that-that you're in love with me!
Well, when you first met Barry, you flitted off to Vail.
Okay, can we change the topic? Because it's really doing nothing for me.
Well, she's not going to find them lying in the grass like that.
Chandler, what are you doing? That thing can put someone's eye out!
Phoebe, Sandra's mad at you too. It-it doesn't bother you?
A new pair of shoes for the Chan-Chan man! Yes!
Right! .. but we "know" what you're wishing for!
Okay! Okay! Okay! We'll see you in about 3 to 4 hours.
Rach, that's great! It's so good that you had a good time in Greece!
Why don't you just have a seat here? OK... give me the Gummi-bears.
I know that there's no hole there, I just really liked that picture.
But you should eat them now because they're hot from the oven.
Okay, does it involve something to do with Pete's computer company?
Dad , Mom . Look! Look who it is it's Chandler!
Hey, come on Phoebe, you can understand why this would be weird for me.
That's Dudley Moore. I said I wanted it like Demi Moore.
: Honey why don't you just let it go and ask her out again.
Umm, if ah, it might be okay if Ross came skiing?
Yeah, apparently they're turning it into some kinda coffee place.
It's not gonna happen. They're doing it tonight, we can do it tomorrow.
All right, we'll stay. We can just drive up after the party.
Chandler, please don't think I was trying to pressure you. Phoebe and Rachel...
You know what, Ross? I'm gonna throw in 50 bucks for you.
What happened to your rule about never sleeping with sick people?
You touch people's eyeballs every day and this feels weird.
Come on. I know you're not eighteen anymore, but give it a minute.
I can't believe it! What is it? Is it the rubbing or the smell?
Oh, honey, can you make sure we get a King size bed!
No, they were really cool. They were on their honeymoon too!
I-I-I wanna thank you all for coming. My family and my friends...
And everybody has to wear costumes. Come on! It'll be fun!
Oh, don't you guys look cute. You guys make such a cute couple.
Hello? Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Okay. I guess we can bet one more time.
Congratulations, I think youve found the worlds thinnest argument.
Good. Okay, I'm just gonna wait for Chandler to open the rest of them.
Well, what do you think of Mike and Chandler being in a car accident?
I mean, I-I, I really shouldn't say. I mean, I'm really not supposed to.
I'd like to have Don and Phoebe over. Wouldn't that be nice?
Two in a row! You've got to use your tongues now!
Oh my pleasure. Okay, I'm afraid I've got some bad news. Phoebe!
Ok, fine!! I bought 20 extra tickets for me and Chandler.
I'm not crying about that! I'm crying about something that happened at work.
What one? You wanted him to invite you to the party and he did it!
Chandler come on. We have to hem the new dust ruffle.
And that's great for you guys, but we want a lawn and a swingset...
Ok, we're not having birthday cake, we're having birthday flan.
Phoebe, listen. You were with me, and we were shopping all day.
All right okay, just so you know, I'm not gonna make a turkey this year.
Nope, she doesn't have to, I found out who the father is.
Our kids are gonna call her Aunt Janice aren't they?
Yeah, the best you got in high school was Wet Pants Geller.
What about the second minister we meet with? I kinda liked him.
Chandler? I was just in our bedroom and I found these on my pillow.
A wuss? Excuse me for living in the real world, okay?
Hey Joey! Aww, you remembered even though you're a big star!
No, it's not bad. It's not bad at all. It's-it's really nice.
Ross, you were right before, it was just a stupid fight about a room.
I'm fine-d. I'm fine-d! Y'know, it's a really hard word to say.
Hi, um, I'm gonna need a new set of these forms .
Wow! And you got a petticure. Your feet are all dressed up.
Yeah! I didn't know there would be dancing. That was a fun surprise!
So on this road trip, did you guys win any money?
Oh my God, this is great! This is so great! . Did you hear that?
I'm Monica. I'm disgusting. I stalk guys and keep their underpants.
Ohh come on, I love this song! Come on, you'll be fine.
Joey, what are you doing?! It's never gonna happen, she's seeing somebody.
Nah, while you're at Ross's if you see any lying around...
The Way You Look Tonight is on here! Dance with me?
Put the plates in the boxes!! Put the plates in the boxes!
Hey Rach, maybe your resolution should be to umm, gossip less.
I know, Amanda! Ah! She called me too! She's the worst!
See? They're as different as night and... later that night.
All right, look, nobody's smoking pot around all this food.
Didn't you hear that speech? If you don't kiss him then I will!
You're gonna like him so much. So umm, when do you want to meet him?
Yeah. I'm okay. I'm actually-I'm a little cold, can I have your jacket?
No! I was just getting into position and then everything went dark.
Okay, this isn't working. I'm still awake and now I have to pee.
Chandler, nobody likes breaking up with someone. You just gotta do it.
Okay, please be good, please. Just remember how much you all like me.
Oh, maybe he was getting him confused with his childhood therapist.
Hi. Uh, we'll be right there, we're just trying to decide something.
And I don't know if you've noticed but she's a HOTTY!! HI!
God, Ross is on a date with your sister! How weird is that?!
No it's not. We had an inspection and they didn't find anything.
Oh my God! Oh my God that's awful! What did you think of the house?
Hey Joey! Isn't that the girl that waved at you the other day?
This is so great! Now we can enter into doubles tournaments!
Oh, who cares, they still love me! "I am so excited..."
Wouldn't kick her out of bed. No more Vodka for me!
Ross , foot on the floor or come over no more!
What are you serious? You wanna marry him? Wha... What about Mike?
If that falls off the truck, it wouldn't be the worst thing.
Ross, just forget about it. This guy's got you totally wedged in.
I'm just saying, if we put just a little bit of makeup on you.
Because Purvry Perverson over here can't stop staring at her.
Are we playing football or what? Come on you hairy-backed Marries.
You're right, I'm sorry. It's not like you're y'know, going out with an ex-girlfriend.
Don't joke with me, okay? I'm very, very upset right now.
Also both of your sisters called and neither can make it.
The dinner will be ready in twenty minutes. This is so exciting.
Finger cramp. Oh God, sorry. Here, let me get that mom.
A quin pidio el pollo General Tso?
Ross, I think we should stick to the routine, we don't wanna look stupid!
Ohh, here you are. Y'know, I'm-I'm glad you decided to hear me out.
So you can like, bite, and pull people's hair and stuff?
Oh, that's okay, I can't wait to see everything again! All of the memories...
They gave us a fake number? Why? Why would they do that?
Jellyfish sting! Oh, it hurts! It hurts!! It hurts!!
Yeah, but Janice? That-that was like the worst breakup in history!
Phoebe, y'know why don't we just go upstairs and have some birthday cake?
Hey. Where is he, where's Richard? Did you ditch him?
Ahhh, hey honey? Don't you have to be at your interview now?
Keep on roaming Bert! We don't want any crazy today!
Look it is not my fault that your chairs are incredibly ugly!
Oh come on! You're making it sound worse than it actually was.
There's no man in here. How dare you accuse me of that.
I can't believe this. Do you think that your parents could help pay for it?
Excuse me, sir, would it help if I weren't wearing underpants?
That is the unusual activity. Look, they just wanna see if you're okay.
Inside of telling us you decided to write in your stupid book!
Um, and, well there's the.. the the small matter of...
Rachel! I'm never gonna think it's okay for you to cheat on your husband!
I can't leave it! You gouged a hole in my dingy floor.
No! No. They're umm... They're just uh...ground beef smileys.
Oh my God! That's Pete! But why is Bill huggin' Pete?
Maybe you don't need him to propose to you, maybe you can propose to him!
Oh, you two must have been so cute running around on a barge.
Oh, that's okay. By the way, I was just checking the shower massager.
Umm, going to the beach. When it stays light real late.
Because we're moving in a couple of days and it just didn't make sense.
What?! You're crazy! There's nothing sexual about the noises I make!
And I assume, Chandler, you are still boycotting all the pilgrim holidays.
Sweetie, I think the glasses look great. They make you look really sexy.
..well, why don't you tell them? After all it, is your ankle.
Well, I mean I guess there is no harm in putting my name down.
Hey, stay out of this, Chandler! This is between me... and ME!
We're not really gonna buy these people steak dinners are we?
Yes, a relationship. For your information I am crazy about this man.
Uh, Rach... how come you have dental floss in your hair?
I guess I set up the video camera to try and entice Joey.
Thank you. This is my friend Phoebe. She's gonna be helping me tonight.
Y'know what, that's fine, maybe you haven't grown up, but I have.
That really means a lot. Oh, and Mom, don't bite your nails.
Okay, so I'm responsible, I'm organised. But hey, I can be a kook.
Passport, check! Camera, check! Traveller's cheques, check!
No! Ace is low! Ace, two, three, four!
Uh, I don't know, butter, eggs, flour, lime, kiwi--
I can't think of anything we're doing. Why can't I think of anything we're doing?
And people will think you own a Porsche because you're wearing the clothes?
You don't? Well, that's the difference between a professional and a layman.
No it's umm, more like a wrap. Okay so uh, I'm gonna go guys.
Rachel umm, I was just talking to this guy and I think he'll have sex with you.
He called the Long Island Expressway a concrete miracle.
Okay, I will. Remember that thing that we just discussed that you wanted to do?
Right. Till I bought a blow dryer, then I was shunned.
Yes! We found you a really cute and funny guy from Chandler's work!
Mr. Heckles, our friend lost a monkey. Have you seen it?
Umm. Well, there's Rachel, and umm, I think that's it. How bout you?
Hey! It's me. Mon-i-ca! Can I just tell you how proud I am of you.
: then why were you watching them and giving YOURSELF a treat.
There's still so much to do. Have you written your vows yet?
I can't walk. Okay? Okay? These boots were a huge mistake!
Doesn't matter, I'll get 'em tomorrow. Or not. Whenever.
Umm, Chandler, if you want I can make you some macaroni and cheese for dinner.
Right, you only go for them 5 minutes before they get married.
They love my candy? Oh man!!! I've gotta go make more!!
Hey Rach, remember that great song, Me, Myself, and I?
We're just two people who find each other very attractive. Right?
Ah, and I mean, he's going out with her? He can not persue this.
Well I'd probably be scared of a guy using a fake voice.
Noo! My ex-boyfriend Richard! Y'know the tall guy, moustache?
Would you slap me? Would you slap me right here in the face?!
Hey, did you get the turkey basted-Oh my God! Oh my God! Who is that?
Oh! Did anybody see that-that documentary on the Korean War?
Come on! So she comes to the wedding! I mean it won't be so bad.
Didn't it drive you crazy to have a switch and not know what it did?
No-no, I-I really don't want to talk about it! I don't! Especially with you.
Well, maybe the mailman liked the cookies, we just didn't give him enough.
All right! Come on Monica! Look alive! Come on, look alive!
Well, I mean what about friends of your grandmother's? Wouldn't they have the recipe?
No! Umm well, some people say that Oysters are an aphrodisiac.
Well, let's just say it's not the first time you've stolen my thunder.
She's the actress that was in Disclosure, Indecent Proposal, Ghost!
Toe the line. Thread the needle. Think outside the box!
I know! I mean it's like me and your dad, that's a totally separate thing.
How hammered are you? Huh? These, these are Joey's sisters.
Oh it's umm, good! It's umm, it's good, just here watering the plants.
Ooh, an ink stain! Hey, can I watch how you get this out?
Uh, huh. Or maybe to a galaxy far, far away.
I thought I lost it. I got a new one, like, a month ago.
I think our lover's spat will start a little early this month.
I can't believe my parents are actually pressuring me to find one of you people.
Just like you told her you did! ... Just pointing out the irony.
We are going to Dick Clark's New Year's Rocking Eve!
Oh my God, she's not gonna like the chicken that night either is she?!
Hey, Rach, can I borrow your eyelash curler, I think I lost mine.
So your first whole weekend without Ben, what're you guys gonna do?
I know, he's just so, so... Do you remember you and Tony DeMarco?
God, you are so lucky. I mean, I mean. . . you know what I mean.
Joey, now that you're okay with the house, do you wanna go see your room?
Do you umm, you really think the best reason to get married is because you're sorry?
Yep, we're gonna meet the lady who could be carrying our baby.
Please! I feel so bad! Just watch the hot woman get naked!
Dr. Miller? P E C F D.
Well what are you gonna do when he finds out he wasn't even asked?!
Yeah, I asked you and Phoebe to pick up the pies. You did remember, right?
Oh, yes, umm, I'm here to pick up a dress that you have on hold.
You guys! Do you realize that any minute now, Phoebe can be pregnant?
Hey, how did it go with Mike, is he gonna let you keep the painting?
Hey. Okay, I gave him another chance, but Tim has got to go!
When I take a shower, she leaves me little notes on the mirror.
Ok, let me go check. Your mom want's to say goodbye.
No I don't know Chandler! Not anymore! It's like it's like something's changed.
You-you gotta take it now. Come on, do it as a present to me.
Joey let me ask you a question. What does this light switch do?
Well, if we owe it? Oh my... When is Joey gonna be home?
Limited seating my ass. Let's see who made the cut. Hi!
No no, it's not working on me. Wow! I must be growing up!
Rachel, you are packed though right, I mean please tell me that you're packed.
No it's not! No! No! Now it's about you and Ross getting back together!
Yeah, ah, but Pheebs don't you think he's a little young to get married?
Yeah, and we've paid for a room, that we're supposed to be in right now!
All right relax Mr. I've Had Sex Four Times!
Like I remember his office number! Speed dial 7.
Dr. Burke? I don't think so. I mean, like, he's a grown up.
Okay, I feel like I'm talking to Lassie. All right, Phoebe would you just tell me!
Oh, it's so beautiful. Ohh! Y'know, I-I don't know if I feel right about this.
Well, tonight, I actually went out with Chip Matthews in high school.
Anyway erm, are you going to get a handyman to install this stuff?
Not never. I mean, I'm gonna see him tomorrow at my eye appointment.
Hey! Okay, so I thought we'd start with my make up and then do my hair.
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
You're still gonna pay me, right? Or something a little less selfish.
What these? Oh, these are, um, for.. cuts and scrapes.
Look look! It's Rachel and Barry. No, don't everybody look at once!
What are you talking about? If you get married in Vegas you're married everywhere.
Oh, you really want to talk about getting people to like you huh, funny man?
Ok, which one of us do you think is gonna be the first one to get married?
Okay, it's baby time. Pants off Bing. Didn't see you there Geller.
Hey Ross! So, I was checking out the uh, real estate section...
A little tight? I could see double-oh and seven in those pants.
Forget it. Not after your cousin who could belch the alphabet.
It was a mistake. Please don't take this to mean anything, because it doesn't.
Ohh, I'm such an idiot. I can't believe I actually thought she could change.
Yeah sure, nature called, she wanted to see who else did.
Oh, it was awful. I guess some people just don't appreciate really good food.
Oh, I asked one of the waitresses at work if she'd help me out.
Rach? Can I talk to for just a minute? I-I dropped some socks.
Ok, but if something gets broken, and then the Queen comes over..
Ping pong? Honey, they have ping pong! Let's play!
'S'going pretty good, y'know? It's nice, and, we're having fun.
Did you also have his album, It's Not Easy Being Green?
Sweetie, you know I have no sense of humor when it comes to the wedding.
Hi. Uh, you... you don't know me, I'm Monica Geller... Ross's sister.
God, this is so hard. I can't decide between lamb or duck.
Oh, we used to drive each other crazy playing the shadow game.
I didn't even tell him to say that. . All right you're off my list.
Ugly Naked Guy's laying kitchen tile. Eww!
No, but she likes me. You abandoned her on a plane to Greece.
We ripped that couple apart, and kept the pieces for ourselves.
Ugh, they sent me home. They said I can't work if I'm sick.
Wait, what about the time I hit you in the face with the Silvian's pumpkin?
He says he wants to leave the country. He thinks you hate him.
It was great! It was great! How about you?! I mean you're having a baby!
Which we are, and-and we already paid for it. It's My Giant!
Well, this must've brought back some really bad memories for you, Ross.
Cute PJ's! You're really livin' it up here in London huh?
Excuse me, Mrs. Burkart? Well, we're all cleaned up in the kitchen.
Say it louder, I don't think the guy all the way in the back heard you!
Wait a minute, wait a minute. Yes he is. You are totally different.
Guys, rules are good! Rules help control the fun! Ohhh!
Yes, I will start with the carpaccio, and then I'll have the grilled prawns.
Oh that's so sweet! Look Chandler I don't care if you can't cry, I love you.
And then he told me he would run away with me, and he didn't.
I need two. I'm bringing Pete. My boyfriend. I have a boyfriend now!
No! Joey and Ross don't know anything and Chandler still thinks that Phoebe's pregnant.
Michelle! Of course, it was Michelle! Did it sound like Michelle?
I can't belive it, I'm gonna be an aunt. I'm gonna have like a nephew.
Look what I found in the drawer... And you said I'd never wear this...
Ok, you're being wierd. Do you want sex or did you do something bad?
Well, next time your massaging him, you should try and distract yourself.
Carol called me to thank me for the lasagna, I asked, she told me.
Oh! It was our pleasure. We are so much enjoying getting to know you.
Where's Benny? There he is! Where's Benny, there he is.
Oh Ross, sometimes grown-ups have commitments they just can't get out of!
Okay, please be careful with that. It was my grandmother's. Be careful.
Oh Rachel don't, don't you dare, don't, don't. Tell him I cook.
I'm guessing your new girlfriend wouldn't urinate on my coffee table.
Do you think things would have been better if you'd just told her the truth?
Yes, I want to change. And why-why don't you go down and get us a table?
'Cause I ran into him at the bank, he is still soo cute.
No! You don't know the system! There'll be nobody messing with the system!
I got one. "Socks. Because your family's feet deserve the best."
No, but... I saw the previews. They played it right before Jackass.
You are so sweet to notice! Yes, I lost three and a half pounds!
Hey Rach, the tampons here are only a penny. Let's stock up.
And Phoebe is his friend, so he thinks that would be breaking the rules!
I know! I know! And he totally freaked out and I can't find him anywhere!
Op, can I just tell you something? Very flattered but umm, I'm engaged.
Hey, we would still be living here if hadn't gotten the question wrong!
Dr. Greene. Oh my God it's Rachel's dad. What're you doing here?
I'm Catwoman, who wants to borrow the dress when you're too big for it.
Now another way to organise your stuffed animals, is by size.
Y'know, I-I... I have to figure...some st-Y'know, some stuff before I can...
Oh no, she's still at work, but she told me to tell you to call her.
Have a seat. Okay, listen umm, Chandler and I are going to live together, here.
Because they don't know we're dating. Do you think we should eat in the kitchen?
Were not doing anything. Were just sitting around talking, quietly.
I just thought that if I could follow the wire I could find out what it did.
Well maybe I'm ready now. I mean, it's a little scary, but maybe it's right.
Phoebe! Come on! Let's go! Come on! Why aren't you dressed yet?!
Wendy, we had a deal! Yeah, you promised! Wendy! Wendy! Wendy!
Oh, honey, I forgot. I promised Treeger that we'd leave our keys.
What does he think? Does he think I'm just gonna wait around for nothing?
You'll be fine. Nah, you won't, but I'll be back in two minutes.
What I said was, was that I understood. Joey's the one who agreed with you!
Ah, come on, sneakers are easy. You wear sneakers all the time.
We're gonna pick up the wedding dress then we're gonna have lunch with mom.
Ooh! I'm sorry! I think, I THINK, that may have missed the table!
I don't know. Hey, Rachel, you want the big plate? I want you to have the big plate.
Okay, the red ones are my guests and the blue ones are yours.
What if my own baby hates me? Huh? What am I gonna do then?
Wow! All right well, I mean, what can you do? If you lost it you lost it.
This is so great! This is exactly how we set the plates at the restaurant.
You should feel great about yourself! You're doing this amazing independence thing!
Yeah! Oh and interesting because I found the cameras in one of our bags!
Ohh, he's really shy. I-I don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet.
I still don't get why Greg and Jenny would give us a fake number.
'Cause, Gary and Phoebe think they're a hotter couple than we are!
Wow. My brother never even told me when he lost his virginity.
STOP IT!! ...Oh my God. It's true! Who am I?
Come on, that was back in high school! How could that still bother you?
I know, but y'know, this time you're gonna definitely know whether or not you did it!
Oh, hang on, hang on. Does Aunt Monica get a say in this?
Who's so brave, you're so brave, yes you are, you're so brave.
Okay. We have got to beat them! {Here we go yet again.}
Nothing. Just something I want to get Phoebe's opinion on for Valentine's Day.
Just a little but...it's just so scary! I don't even know what I would sing...
You are going to make a joke about my special present! Why would you do that?!
I don't see him. Hey! Maybe he's in the sugar bowl! Joey? Nope!
Okay, I'm never gonna wear them again. I just didn't get a chance to say goodbye.
Yeah! But, he can't not exactly see Emily, I mean that's his wife.
Hey, you know I got a question for ya. Just a little thing, no pressure.
I'm telling you, she went to the airport, and she's gonna go for it with Ross!
Thank you. It was so beautiful. I'm going to go to Joeys and get the pies.
Okay, one more, please. Come on, I'm gonna get it in this time, I will.
Not the way they're doing it. What, what happened? How did she die?
I don't know. I mean, I guess having sex in front of a baby isn't so...
Uhm, she has been showing us houses outside of the city.
You want a job? Turn off "Oprah," and send out a resume!
No, it doesn't say where it came from. Where would we return it?
Now there you go! I wouldn't want my best guest to strain her eyes!
Hey, thank you. Thank you so much. . You are SO going to Heaven!
Yeah, it's just we don't think of you as really being so much "with the words".
Well, we... "bore false witness"... See I could be a reverend.
Oh good, another dinosaur story. When are those gonna become extinct?
Aren't you afraid that Joey's going to figure all of this out? I heard it.
No! no! Let's figure out a fair way to decide who's staying.
Ross has never checked out of a room a minute before he had to.
Hey Maureen! Gosh! Hey uh, Chandler? This is my cousin Maureen.
Uh, so anyway, we thought one of you could read something during the ceremony.
Well yeah, but, you know, uh, 27 is a dangerous eye age.
Well, he did manage to keep his identity secret for a long time.
Oh, look! Acting for Beginners! Want to feel good about yourself?
Well, they're just gonna have to wait aren't they? I've only got two hands!!
Ok, alright, you guys, you'd better sit down, this is pretty big.
Joey, did you even interview this woman before you asked her to move in?
Because... I'm Monica Geller. It was my credit card you were using.
Wow, Monica! What an amazing opportunity to influence... dozens of people.
What did the doctor say? Any news on when the baby will come?
I want you to meet someone really special. Phoebe, this is Erica. And this is the baby!
Joey, we had a deal. That-that's why you're here! I've got to fire you!
Wait! Wait! Wait! You can't start today! Today's the rehearsal dinner!
All right. Have you said, "I love you?" You could say, I love you.
Phoebe I think he would notice if you didn't have a baby in nine months!
Well, we thought we would all go to a picnic , in Central Park!
Well, do you think he was waiting 'til after you left, so he could cry?
Look, I-I'm never gonna let you up so you may as well just go away.
Come on, okay, come on this is for all womankind. Let's kill 'um!
Come on! Come on, I was kidding! It was such an obvious joke!
The guy who made these hates feet and wants to see them die!
Oh that's cute! We really all enjoyed it. But y'know, it doesn't count.
There's something that we wanna tell you. We decided to name the girl-baby Erica.
Umm, listen I am sorry, but I'll put some out first thing in the morning.
Got it! Got it! Got it! Got it! Got it! Got it!
What does the red X next to Bob Greenmore's name mean?
It's harder for me! I have those four other women to compete with!
Two it is. Ok, time for bed, I'm gonna go brush my teeth.
It's goin' great. Right on schedule. Got my little happy helpers.
So that marriage stuff that you were saying yesterday, you don't really believe that do you?
Probably some y'know, European good-bye thing he picked up in London.
Oh, is that why you did it the secret hallway where nobody ever goes?!
Oh no no no no... this is dangerous territory. Keep it clean!
Oh, that's because I had lunch with Rich-Me neither! Okay, what do I want now?
Y'see, this is where you'd use that 'hello' word we talked about.
No, he didn't! He pretended to be a Quaker to get out of Korea.
Oh, then you do know it. So um what kind of things do you write about?
Oh my God, he's gonna do it now. Please, I cannot watch this, let's go.
Okay, I'll rest. But y'know if I'm going to bed, then you're coming with me.
It's gonna be weird to watch some actor pretending to be Ben's dad.
We don't have much time. Once the egg descended the oviduct ...
Phoebe, it's okay that you don't want me to be your girlfriend because I have the best boyfriend.
I'm telling-If you put that in her apartment you'll never hear the end of it.
Hey Rach, come on! We're gonna be late for the eye doctor appointment!
I-I am serious, I mean, we're, we're all over each other all the time.
No I didn't, I said kiwi lime. That's what makes it so special.
Alright, here we go. We've got salmon roulettes and assorted crudites.
Wow! A star! I know you all hate me and-and I'm sorry, but I don't care.
All right, that's it. You know what? Just get out of my way and stop moping.
So, I'm, I'm probably still ovulating. Do you want to give it another try?
All right shut up for a second and let me just see something. Oh, wow!
Hey, hold on there, tiger. How's it going? How you holding up?
That's it. I'm done. I don't care when the baby comes, no more betting.
Oh that's my doodle of a ladybug, with a top hat. She's fancy.
Vomit tux? Who vomited on-y'know what, what you up to Joe?
No, no really. I.. I wouldn't feel right about it. Just some water.
Oh my God! Did you hear that? She hired me because she thinks I'm good.
OK, great. You'll tell us and we'll laugh. Let's play poker.
I'm gonna leave some cards here. Please think of us for you next event.
No, my eye doctor is Richard! I can't go to him when I don't have a boyfriend!
When you were reading the dirty magazines without taking off the plastic!
Oh my God! Joey, what did you do after you threw her leg on the fire?
Oh, Nancy Thompson from Phoebe's old massage place is getting fired.
Oh that's okay. Don't worry about it, you can give it to me when we get back.
But what if it is better than ours? Should we at least look?
Yes! All right, y'know what? Why don't we start with a practice run? Okay?
Oh no! My parents have never seen me drunk! That they know of.
Oh, you came to tell him you love him! I knew it! I was right! I'm right, right?
: sweetie it's ok, I still love you, let me be a part of this.
...in this day and age how dumb do you have to be to get pregnant?
Wow! Play that message for Emily and this whole problem goes away!
Oh my God! No wonder I get such great service at Cafe Maurice.
Yeah, like I don't know, maybe you have a work problem that you need his advice on.
Wait wait wait. I was at home the whole time. How did I missed that?
Sure! It doesn't mean anything! Just like I know it doesn't mean anything with you!
You have to help me! I'm supposed to be writing my vows and all I have is this!
Joey, this is sick, it's disgusting, it's, it'snot really true, is it?
Yeah, and I wanted her to get to know the doctors and get settled into the hotel.
This is so unfair! She's got everything I want, and she doesn't have my mother.
Okay, but wouldn't it be easier if you had to tell me something that you could tell me.
Mira, Ross, Marcel se llevo el control remoto.
You know what? This has been kind of a girlie day. You're right, I'm sorry.
How cool is this?! We know three down! I'm touching three down!
Rose Marie really belongs on a smaller screen, doesn't she?
Hey guys! Do you wanna look at the song list for the wedding? Guys?
Come on...I just need it for some rent and..and some other bills.
Uhm, we just wanna give you a heads-up. Bill and Colleen hate us.
I'm glad you're here, we have a couple of things to ask you about the wedding ceremony.
What?! Are you kidding me?! You-you-you think we're ready to have a baby now?!
I have no idea, but X-rays alone could be a couple hundred dollars.
All right, hand me that other box of photos; that's the very last one.
Well, you don't have to decide right now, but if you could just look at our file...
Uh, listen, I need that broiling pan that Joey borrowed the other day.
Ohh, I've always wanted to go to this culinary fair that they have in Jersey!
Ohhh! No! This is my friend Rachel, we went to High School together.
I know that you're new at this, but this is completely unacceptable bath decorum.
...They threw us out! I was thrown out of a hotel! Me!
I can't believe we are at a real college party! I have to pee so bad!
Ooh, these tennis shoes are so tight. I think I'll take them off.
Oh, Aunt Liddy's coming? That means we get five dollars each!
Listen...I need to know that what I'm about to ask you, will never get back to Chandler.
Chandler, listen to me sweetie, I know you can do this. Okay? You have a beautiful smile.
I'm just having one of those days where you realize you're in a dead-end relationship!
Now you think I wouldn't enjoy that, because it is so fake, but I still do.
I gotcha. Sorry. So, did you ever make him throw up a whole anything?
Do you want me to cry? Is that what you want? Do you wanna see me cry?
It's my new perfume. Why don't you come closer where you can really appreciate it?
Here's the plan! Okay? I'm going to leave you get a look at Brenda's bra!
Ross's apartment is nice! How come we don't hang out here more often?
Okay! There's only one left, three letter word, not dog but...
Well, he told me he was going out with the guys, I just didn't know that you were the guys.
Well, now's a good time. I'm on my way to have my ears cut off.
Danny? You know Rachel? She's nice. She's not bad to look at, right?
It wasn't funny at all! Why would you do that? Why didn't you pick me?
You know what probably happened? Someone musta stolen my credit card.
Now are drawers will smell nice and we didn't waste these pantyhose.
Oh God! He's gonna come by and borrow some candles for his big date!
Ice, ice, ice squares anyone? Take a napkin. Alright.
I got it! How about, if we win, they have to get rid of the rooster?
You were the next caller five hours ago. You must be going crazy.
Yeah, I do think it's better this way. Yeah, we're being smart. Yes, I'm sure.
So you wanna tell us now, or are we waiting for four wet bridesmaids?
Oh, you can't show Phoebe this! She hates those corporate massage chains.
Hey, honey, my test is down the hall, are you sure you're going to be ok?
I know this is embarrassing, but nobody cares! No one here even knows you!
Look, I don't wanna do this test either, but I really do think it's a good idea!
Oh my God! A friend he's looking at differently, but it's wrong. It's Rachel!
Do you remember that jacket that you love so much, that you thought was too expensive?
Wow, that is a surprise. Just one little question, uh, why not Ross's room?
Maybe Joey doesn't have to give you the money, TV stars have assistants right?
What?! Why? Why is this crazy? So this isn't the ideal way to something....
Hi Honey! We're all here; we just want to wish you a Merry Christmas.
They wouldn't have put it there if it didn't do something! How can you not care?
No. I think we learned that from the sugarlips incident. I'm gonna get some tea.
I'm sick of the signs! It's too fast, I'm happy the way things are!
"Oh my God, I love Ross! I hate Ross! I love Ross! I hate Ross!"
Oh, what a great gift! Is The Way You Look Tonight on it?!
Chandler! I have to tell you, you smell so smokey I have to get up. I'm not kidding.
Oh! I hate that guy! I mean come on kid! Pull up your pants!
Y'know what? It really creeps me out choosing other people's sex clothes.
Why, it's dinner for six. 5 steaks, and an eggplant for Phoebe.
Maybe I can try at intermission? Phoebe, come on... you know what? Let's just go!
Hey. So um, I was thinking that maybe we should start dividing up our stuff.
Okay. I'm gonna be the mom that makes the world's best chocolate chip cookies.
I understand, but you're wishing for what we think you're wishing for, aren't you?
Hey, maybe I'll drive you up there! I'd like to buy some tickets myself!
Rachel, I need to borrow-You're not packed!!!! You're not packed even a little bit!
Since we've been going out, I think I've mentioned his name twice!
Well, it doesn't really matter ... you're both wishing for the same thing, right?
All right, you're telling me you can eat an entire turkey in just one sitting?
You're wrong! The centerpieces are fine! Do you ever get scared at all?
Remember that guy that gave me a bad review? Well... I'm getting my revenge!
Good, so do it Saturday night because we're going to dinner with her and Clark.
Wait a minute, I think Phoebe's right. You know I hear someone else in there with him.
Bye! Ten bucks says, I never see that woman again in my life.
Yeah, can we go call them? Is it too soon to call? I wanna call.
The basket is totally empty! My God, the neighbors ate all the candy!
I'm telling you, something's wrong! My brother does not stay out all night.
The second sister dies in Archie and Jughead Double Digest?
Really? Wow! It looks like I had some trouble staying inside the lines.
Oh no-no-no, stay, stay, stay, just keep talking. I'm always the hostess.
'Cause if you do that means you'd be cancelling it for me, and we're just friends.
Well, y'know how I always wanted to go out with Chip Matthews in high school?
Chandler, this is not our problem. We've got each other. That's all that matters.
I'm gonna go put my make up on, we have to be at the hotel in an hour!
So you can't lose, it's there in the title. Wonderfullness is baked right in.
I know there'll be other houses, but it's just so... I love that one so much.
Hi. We checked the third and fourth floor, no-one's seen Marcel.
So umm, when I was in the shower I was thinking about our first night in London...
All right, I know you're hurting, and-and I want to be supportive, but don't say that again.
So what if he wants to sleep with her? I mean, she's single and he's cute.
Oh, great! Just what you want for a new house with infants. Bird feces.
Because that's where the party is you goon. See this is just the staging area.
You're not gonna go anywhere, you said you were gonna eat here, and you're gonna eat here!
I would get a room with this cake. I think I could show this cake a good time!
Okay, I'm next. Don't! Don't start another game! I said I'm next! Phoebe!
What are you talking about? She just invited him to the biggest party of the millennium!
Yeah, come on, eat, whatever you want. Dr. Roger got beeped again.
But what kind of a sick bastard wants to do it in front of a deer?
Went down to the docks. Bet ya didn't know you could get it wholesale.
Oh, you're so sweet. Oh, but wait, what about our, what about the future and stuff?
I guess with you doing the internship, we're just spending more than we're bringing in.
And you've never been funnier. Joke, joke, joke, you were a hoot!
ooohh... hey! Wanna stick around and I'll whip you up some dinner?
You had sex in his chair?!... I said that a little too loudly, didn't I?
Well, y'know I-I-I think I'm gonna respect the privacy of my new secret boyfriend.
I don't know! Time to kiss a guy maybe?! What are you laughing at Pampers?
: OK... Dear Ms. Green... yeah... yeah... yeah... No.
I mean, I realize that his feelings may never completely go away, but you can.
They're all in there! Even these five that I hid in my bra ...
In the beginning where y'know it's all sex and talking and sex and talking and...
Baddest. Otherwise the song would be Fat Fat Leroy Brown.
What? We took a walk, nothing happened. I can back with nothing all over me.
Couldn't you just stay like this forever? Chandler! Couldn't you just stay here forever?
All right look, if I take Chandler out of the running will you be able to focus?
Well fine! I want to meet this chicken expert! Send the Colonel in!
Pheebs, you remember how we talked about saying things quietly to yourself first?
Ok..You know the old classics you know,You look nice? They're still ok.
It meant nothing! Okay? After all this time, how can you not trust me?
OK, I'll go. OK, senior year of college... on a pool table.
Hello Dan! I'm really looking forward to Saturday night! Really, really!
Ohh, Please?! I'm a single mom, with a thirty year old son!!
All right. We're gonna go. It's not for another six hours. We're gonna go then.
Do NOT let me sit in one of those. We'll be here for days.
Oh! You assume because I was heavy that's the only way I could win something?
Chandler could you at least send some women to my party? Alright that's Ross.
I think his begging days are over now that he's going out with Nancy Branson.
See what happens when you give people advice? I hope you told him not to?
Okay, I'd like to know how much the room was because I'd like to pay my half.
What?! You paid a thousand dollars for a cat when you owe me 300!!
Yeah! Okay, this one is a mushroom cap. Umm, this one is made of bologna.
You know, when you start get screwed over all the time, you gotta switch to low-fat.
Oh. So nice of her to pull my hair, 'till I dropped the key!
I'm gonna go into the bathroom so I can look at it in the mirror, as I eat it.
First of all um, I love you both so much and you're both so important to me...
Ok, everybody, there's food and drinks on the table. Go across the hall.
Honey, you've been really strong about this, I know how badly you wanted that job.
I don't understand, I mean am I so hard to live, is this why I don't have a boyfriend?
Rachel-Rachel-Rachel I-I cannot, I can't let-, actually I kinda want to see what happens.
Okay, but there is a wire back there! I mean that switch is connected to something!
But we were hoping that since we told you the truth that you still might consider...
I just-I can't believe that you think that you and Chandler know me and Rachel better than we know you.
Sandra, I am so sorry, I thought you were Rachel and we just weren't ready for you yet.
You wanna go right now? 'Cause I'll take you right now, buddy! You wanna go?
Hello! Were we at the same table? It's like... cocktails in Appalachia.
C'mon. Keeps his fingers to himself and he's always minty fresh.
Yes! Now, they're a little more than I normally spend on boots...or rent
Honey, what is the Bruce Springsteen CD in the Kat Stevens case?
That's a good idea! I bet they have one of those wind machines! Y'know...
Chandler! Okay, let me get this straight, it's okay for you to flirt, but not for me.
Al-alright, l-look you guys, this is the best relationship I've been in. . .
All right, he's keys are in the drawer. Y'know what? I also need some cash.
Oh, wow, so you're gonna be one of those "healthy, healthy, healthy guys"?
This was fun! But I've got an invasive vaginal exam to get to!
No, no, wait. His flight doesn't leave for another forty-five more minutes.
Chinadolor Bong, come on, we steal that TV Guide every week!
Hey! Mrs. Altman was the kind of woman you could tell she used to be pretty.
Well, maybe she thought that with all of your history it could be, you know, implicit.
Yeah, a-a-and clean. Not just health department clean... Monica clean.
Mhm, helpful brother - creepy loner at teen movie.
Do this for me! Come on, I catch you looking at woman's breasts all the time!
Okay. Man, I have not made this many cookies since I was in the ninth grade.
Well, doing nothing on your thirtieth is better than doing something stupid, like Ross.
Okay well, then we'll both do it today and he'll just have to deal with it!
Mrs. Bing? Here, these are my parents umm, Judy and Jack Geller.
You obviously haven't screwed over a lot of your friends. Which we all appreciate.
So I don't have to sing and I can just sit there and pass judgments on others?
They're in the kitchen getting something to eat. Can you believe how nice they are?
You're not dressed yet?! We're supposed to start having fun in 15 minutes!
I still say that if we had called your dad we coulda gotten better seats.
I... I'm sorry, did you say something? I can't hear through all this damned hair!
Oh, we were playing "peek-a-boo." She just - she loves it when I'm dramatic.
Just go up to her and ask her out. Oh, what's the worst thing that could happen?
Okay fine! Fine! Then you know what, I'll just write about Phyllis! Hmm!
Oh my god! Did you hear that? She said Monica! Oooh, I can't leave her!
Phoebe, he's a friend of my parents. He's like 20 years older than me.
Nooo! No, that's not true. No, best time ever! Yeah, you rocked me world!
Now see, this way you protect the plate.. and lets face it you have fun.
All right. Tell me if this is too cute. Lesbian wedding, chicken breasts.
Just breathe, breathe.. that's it. Just try to think of nice calm things...
Sorry. But I kind of have this feeling that we may have made a baby last night.
Did I miss it? Rachel, I-I want you to know that, if it's positive, we're gonna...
That's Mindy? Wow, she is pretty. Lucky. To have had a friend like you.
Ugh, I knew giving you that book was gonna come back and bite me in the ass!
Come on! Come on, it'll be fun! It'll make me feel so much better.
I can't believe she's gonna say yes to David. She's clearly in love with Mike.
Wait, no-no-no, I can go really fast! Dad, give me the keys to your Porsche!
Oh, Rachel, sweetie, look, here's a really cute picture of Joey and you at the reception.
See there you go. Woo! We're out of the woods. Okay, I'll get dressed now.
Honey, you made the bed again. I told you, you don't have to do that. This isn't camp.
Well, I'm gonna fill in for him as food critic for the Chelsea Reporter.
Oh hey Joey! We've been watching all day, when are you gonna be on TV?
You, and you, you're supposed to be at my party. And Gunther! What are you doing here?
Yeah, and in the long version, I dump him for telling people the short version.
Oh he's nice. He's nice! Y'know, you always stick up for the people we fog!
Okay, good, 'cause umm, well maybe we could have a little workout of our own...
All right, y'know what? We really are late! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!!
Okay, maybe people give out fake numbers, but they don't give out fake names.
What? You freak! You wouldn't even have known about this place if it wasn't for me!
So look umm, while we're st-still in London, I mean, we can keep doing it right?
Yeah I can! And don't think I don't, because I do! I mean all the time, you betcha!
Okay, we have a lot of options here, a number of prototypes for you to try on.
Hi, come in! Paul, this is.. ... everybody, everybody, this is Paul.
Yeah, I've just been fiddling around in here making delicious treats for everyone.
Oh wait, just one more thing! One more minute! Umm, you're a stupid bitch.
All right, but if-if he lights someone else on fire he is out of there!
Yeah with Chandler not getting paid, we could really use 300 million dollars.
Look, if you want you can keep it at our place until you find out what to do with it.
Phoebe knows and she's just trying to freak us out! That's the only explanation for it!
Guys! Guys! I just saw two people having sex in a car right outside.
All right fine, your guy may have a great body, but our guy is really funny.
Ok worse case scenario is...we borrow some money from my parents.
Cowboy boots? I've never worn cowboy boots in my whole life!
Chandler there's nothing wrong with crying! I mean you don't have to be so macho all the time.
Yeah. I mean it was kinda fun for a while, but didn't you start feeling silly?
It was okay. She's still kind of depressed because she broke up with her boyfriend.
Uh Tim? This is Phoebe. Phoebe this is Tim, my new sous chef.
We are the hottest! Huh? No one is hotter than we are! You're the best.
Really? Okay, so why don't you tell me what happened to Ross Junior year at Disneyland?
Yeah. All right, I'm gonna go tell Dan that it's not gonna happen. Don't do the dance.
Oh no, I already packed. The only thing I couldn't find though was your Speedo.
No, Phoebe, I'll tell you what, if you get ready now I'll let you play it at the wedding.
No I'm not sure that it's the best way to hear everything. Someone get me a glass!
This is me in The Sound of Music. See the von Trapp kids?
But Phoebe, you can go out with a creepy guy any night of the year. I know I do.
No Chandler no! No unscheduled stops. You can go when we stop for gas.
Oh. I guess you can. Okay but; I-I have to return it, so you can't like it.
You can't fire me. I make your decisions and I say, "I'm not fired!" Ha!
Olivia? I thought she was marrying Connor! Oh right, real life more important.
Is it like for dinosaur emergencies. 'Help, come quick, they're still extinct.'
Remember that guy from cooking school I told you about that put cilantro with everything?
Doesn't it ever just freak you out that-that you're never gonna be with anybody new again?
He's got something plastic lodged in his throat, we've got to go to the hospital.
Uh Rachel? Rachel, why don't you sit here? And Will you sit way over there.
Don't worry Joe, I won't come next year! Joey: What have you got there?
I don't know how museums work in England but, here, you're not supposed to take stuff.
Jean-Claude Van Damme. I didn't know he was in this movie, he is so hot.
Oh, honey!I can't. I was just telling these guys that things are crazy at the restaurant!
I know being spit on is probably not what you need right now. Um... how long?
Yeah, you really shouldn't. By the way, how was that year-long dig in Cairo?
Yes, because all good plans start with, "I'll go down the fire escape."
Rachel, say that I'm friends with her, we spend some time together. Is that so terrible?
Yeah. I bet you can't guess what color my tonsils are? I'll bet the apartment!
That's because he wasn't invited because of the way he behaved at our engagement party.
Okay, now that everything's wrapped up here, I think I'm, I'm gonna go do my laundry.
Yeah you will! The right guy is just around the corner! Okay, are we done with that?
A salad? Really I, I could do something a little more complicated if you like.
I can't believe we've never done this before! It's sooo good! So good for Monica!
Well maybe we can make a, a, a 'B' out of one of those roses.
It's supposed to be that small. It's a pre-appetizer. The French call it an amouz-bouche.
Look, I know that I should've told them. I know I shouldn't care what they think. I'm sorry.
Hey. Ross, did you know Mom and Dad are going to Puerto Rico for Thanksgiving?
Wow! That's great! Dad must really like you, he doesn't ask just anyone to play.
Ross let me ask you a question. All jokes aside, where is this relationship going?
What do you want me to do? Just sit here silently while you three have a conversation?
Okay, ooh, alright. Name, address... Okay, in case of emergency, call?
Wait a minute. Are you honestly telling me that-that you may never want to get married?
That would be a terrible punishment. But, I'm serious, I've never seen these before.
Oh, really? So why was I busting my ass to make this delicious Thanksgiving dinner?
This is crazy! I mean, it's such a stupid argument. I don't even wanna see Richard again.
She pulled it out of me! She's like a conversational wizard! How'd it go?
Well, I-I-there was this guy at the bank that I thought was cute umm, but I don't anymore.
Oh, absolutely. Yeah, you know I'm not even thinking about that thing that we're not supposed to think about.
That's okay, this is more important than fruit on my ceiling! You broke up?!
You know, I knew a girl in high school who did that. She was very popular.
Wow! That Mike thing was interesting! I don't know what's gonna happen with Phoebe and David.
Chandler, umm, I want you to take just a minute and I want you to think about how ridiculous this sounds.
Well, you broke up with Julie Grath! How much weight could she have gained?
I love you. Oh, wait, wait, wait! No hugs. The dresses... Oh what the hell.
I think so. Se, he-he's not inviting you to his party because he likes you.
I know. I just wish that once, I'd bring a guy home that they actually liked.
No, of course not. It's not even an issue. Cause I told him I was 22.
Hold it! Are you talking about Dick Clark's New Year's Rocking Eve?
But still, it's a big change. The end of an era, you might say!
He had to go, there's a deer just outside eating fruit from the orchard.
Wow, really? One time he just looked at my bra and it popped open.
Daddy! I don't think we need to hear about the specific positions you and mom had sex.
Because, you were mean to me and you, you teased me and you always, always got your way.
Chandler, please! Do you know how unbelievably glad I am that Joey was not there that night?!
I'm not sick!! I don't get sick! Getting sick is for weaklings and for pansies!
I said we are not going to do it, okay? Sometimes you can be such a, a big baby.
Oh because it doesn't...really fit. Oh by the way, I-I booked the Swing Kings.
Yeah, sure... uhm, I'm devastated, obviously... Did you think the neighborhood was homey?
Wow, you seem to be doing so much better. That's great. So how-how are things going?
Wait a minute, are you doing Joey's "Audition didn't go so well. Yeah it did?"
: maybe I will go yea will have a second honeymoon at the Tulsa romana.
Honey, having a heart attack is nature's way of telling you to slow it down.
Well uh, you and I are just goofing around, I thought, why not goof around with him.
Honey. Uh, not to sound too Florence Henderson but, dinner's on the table.
No-no, I-I just, I liked them so much that I went out and bought some for myself.
Yeah. Hey, that was nice of you guys to back off and let Joey get the girl for once.
I can't believe Joey's having lunch with his stalker. What i-, what is she like.
Well I guess there is no harm in telling you now, Rachel and Ross are gonna have a baby.
Of course I have! What do you think, I'm some 30 year old virgin?
Joey, I left my watch on the counter last night. It was right here, where is it?
I'm sorry, okay? It just-tonight was supposed to be y'know, it was supposed to be a big deal.
Then you'd be going back and forth all the time, I mean it doesn't make any sense.
My boots in tan! Hey! Can you get a little closer so I can see the price?
You're so pathetic! Why can't you just accept it, we're winning because I'm better than you.
No! But, I'm throwing this shirt away! I think there was a little misunderstanding before.
What is it with you people! I mean, the minute you start to feel something, you have to run away?
That's right. My Mom doesn't have any faith in me! Oh, that's hilarious! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.
I don't know! Why don't you just explain? What do they want? Find out what they want!
Oh, Chandler, that's sweet. But you don't have to do everything Doctor Phil tells you to do.
Yes, thank you so much. And again, we're so sorry. We could not feel worse about it.
No you're not. You're, you're allergic to lobster and peanuts and--oh my god.
Does it have to do with-with Chandler and that sock that he keeps by his bed?
Thank you! 2nd Customer: It was. The duck in particular was superb.
Some people have been saying its y'know little drops of heaven, but whatever.
I swear I didn't know she was a hooker! I mean wh-Did you let her smoke in here?
Phoebe! But I could take one of those little feet and put it in a pita pocket.
Ok, I don't wanna be negative so I'll say that most of the signs you bought are good.
Oh yeah? Well when you learned how to dance did you forget how to put on underpants?
Ah, it's an honest mistake. It could happen to anyone. All right, see ya.
Yeah, I'll be fine. You know, maybe I'll stay here and practice the art of seduction.
Thank you so much for seeing us. Phoebe has told us such great things about you guys.
With a wok? I thought you were going to read my boring book to put you asleep.
Ha,ha, ha, oh my life is just so amusing. Could we drop it now?
Hey, guess what I'm doing this weekend! I'm going to this culinary fair in New Jersey.
It's just that he doesn't have that much free time, ya know, and I don't know, what do I do?
Whatever Ross! Just replace the bulbs in the brake lights after you're done.
Rachel, what's going on? I mean isn't this the same Barry who you left at the altar?
What? So you guys don't mind going out with someone else who's going out with someone else?
Wait, you can't have the baby here! I mean I haven't sterilised it since the guys moved out!
Oh my God! She's amazing. Oh, oh I'm so glad you guys got drunk and had sex!
Here's your key. All right, you have to christen it! Now, go out and come back in!
Ooh! But the band and the photographer are coming all the way in from New Jersey!
That is so sweet. I know that I was acting a little crazy but umm, I feel the same way.
Wait, was this a-a small mediterranean guy with curiously intelligent good looks?
I'm so sorry that you had to find out this way. I'm sorry, but it's true, I love him too.
Okay. That's okay. I-I know that you're very upset right now. I know, I know that wasn't about me.
He's not great umm, but he's dealing with it. Oh wait a minute, you're not gonna try...
Why would I care where Chandler is? You know uhh...You know sometimes I don't even like Chandler.
Phoebe, you got Joey drums to annoy Rachel, so she wouldn't wanna live there anymore?
Thank you. So what does this Bob guy look like? Is he tall? Short?
Well it's...I mean I'd just-I'd be self-conscious. You're my friend; I'd be naked.
Y'know what, I think we should play a game. I mean come on, it's been twelve years.
So do you guys gonna come over tomorrow? I'll make that pasta thing I was telling you about.
Alright, I tell you what, I'll give this to you now if you can tell me where we keep the dustpan.
You heard the woman. Peel, chop, devil! I can't believe I lost 2 minutes.
Well uh, I'm trying to make something for Joey. Do you mind if I raid your fridge?
I told you you were a bath person! Hey, when you get out, maybe I can give you a facial!
Hey, look at me. I'm making jam, been at it since 4 o'clock this morning.
So! So we've got to go upstairs and have a lot of sex to prove them wrong!
Oh, I'm glad. Listen, I want to apologize about Chandler, though. I just did not see this coming.
Are you insane? I mean Joey, is going to kill you, he's actually going to kill you dead.
Oh, I've got it! I have got it! Pictures from your childhood. This will get you going good!
What?! Come on I am tough! Punch me right here! As hard as you can!
Okay fine! I keep betting Phoebe that you're gonna have the baby and I don't want to lose again!
Well, no, not at all, you're not terminal, you just, you just need some damage control.
Oh my God, can you believe we are surrounded by all this? I can barely control myself.
Chandler, there is nothing in there that concerns you! If you love me you-you'll let it go.
I would love too, but I can't! I mean I just can't, you know that I'm not good at confrontation.
Really? I'm perfectly comfortable. Hey, hey, hey, get in line buddy, I was next.
He wanted to tell me he's gonna compete is some ultimate fighting competition thingy.
Oh, the way you crushed Mike at ping pong was such a turn-on.You wanna...?
That's what it says here. Flight 421, leaves at 8:40, Newark airport.
Yeah, but the important thing to know about us, is how much we would care for this little baby.
All right people listen, I've got exactly twenty-eight minutes before I have to baste again.
Ugh, y'know, umm we gotta get up early and catch that plane for New York.
Well, are you asleep right now, Joe? 'Cause I don't think you have to wear it unless you are!
Oh man! If I had known I was coming to this party I never would have gotten married!
Wow, come in, have a seat. You must be exhausted coming all the way from...Texas.
I can't get married until I get something old, something new, something borrowed, and something blue.
How about if I dance around all covered in sauce? Huh? You think it's funny now?
Well, because every time we do, you make jokes about swinging and scare them away.
...And then we throw your body in the water... Gee, that does sound fun.
Well, I did one time, and-and I want to start doing it more. See that's what this is about.
Well, honey, it is pretty competitive. I mean I've got an actual rocket scientist here.
Joey, what are you doing? You promised Phoebe you wouldn't eat meat until she has the babies!
Oh, I'd like a latte. Oh y'know what? If you're gonna talk about me, I'm gonna go with you.
What's the big deal with her? Maybe she's attractive in an obvious kind of way.
Okay. I'm guessing that if you don't want to deliver, you probably don't want to pick stuff up either.
Yeah, y'know I-I made a commitment to you. Y'know what, it'd be, it'd be fun.
Y'know, I don't have an appointment, but I sure could use a physical. Are you sure you're okay?
Yeah, I talked to you on the phone, I'm the lady that got stuck with the racecar bed.
My brother, the PhD would like to know if there's any way to treat this orally.
Ok, um so, I still have to invite Dillon and Emma and Shannon Cooper.
I know what you need, you need a bodyguard. Hey Ross, what is Ben doing after preschool?
Oh Joey, look, we know you're having a hard time with this, but we really, we love it here.
We were, we were just in the storage area and we saw this really creepy man!
Man, man that is sharp. It must have cost you quite a few debloons.
Phoebe! I have to have those earrings, we're going to leave as soon as the show is over.
Okay, so it doesn't involve Ross or Rachel or Chandler or Joey. But, what about Pete?
She's a hooker! She's a hooker! She's a... Hi! Uh, we spoke on the phone.
No. Big deal, so you have a side of the bed, everybody has a side of the bed.
Oh, will you do the top of the cabinets? That'll really work up your appetite for lunch.
Okay. Phoebe that's it. Come on, get out-out of the chair. Get out! Oh come...Phoebe!
See? Ben doesn't think you're a loser, he thinks you're a cowboy! Now that's something.
I can't do it. I'm sorry, I wish I could, but umm, see you have these feelings for me....
Find some! Please! Anything that doesn't say I-I died tragically in France.
No, I know. But y'know what? It would make me feel better if Lewis apologized to me.
I-It's just so insulting! Big spring for a new blank tape, Doctor!
This is a garden view room, and we paid for an ocean view room.
Did you like her? And I'm just asking as a friend, because I am totally fine with this.
Well you let me know if you can, because y'know I can bake a pie to cover it.
Y'know what, this is obviously some kind of twisted joke she's trying to play on him.
My God, Rachel, I can't believe Phoebe made out with Ralph Lauren. Ohh, I'm so jealous.
I know, I've been looking at those doors, they look pretty sound proof, don't you think?
Can I ask you guys a question? D'you ever think that Alan is maybe.. sometimes..
Oh no it's not, no it's not. It's a first date. I'm sure that nothing is gonna...
Well uh, you and I are just goofing around, I thought, why not just goof around with him.
Wait-wait, guys! If-if we follow the rules, it's still fun and it means something!
If someone wants to give us a present, we don't want to deprive them of that joy.
Y'know if it's any consolation, he really did sound like he was having more fun with you.
I'm on top of the world, looking down on creation and the only explanation I can find...
Well, if you had kept listening, you-you would have heard me call him Mr. Big......ot.
Ross, come sign this birthday card for dad. Rich is gonna be here any minute.
Yeah... ..see, I was supposed to get married, but, um, I left the guy at the altar.
Hmm, care to make it interesting? I'll bet you that she'll have it by this time tomorrow.
No. Um, I know you like this, and I want you to have it. I think it'll look good in our apartment.
Um, you guys, you know when I said before, "thank you, but I don't really need your help"?
Wait. Rachel, no, he's married. Married! If you don't realise that, I can't help you.
Okay, listen, there's still some of Chandler's medicine under the sink in the bathroom. Bye!
Could you guys please try to keep it down, we're trying to start a Boggle tournament.
Let's just do it right now. Okay? It won't be hard. Just say what's in your heart.
: what's the big deal, you forgot, she forgot, maybe you were having an off night.
Oh my God! Ross, you wouldn't believe the cute little noises the twins are making. Listen.
Okay, fine I admit it! I feel terrible! Would you please rub this on my chest?
Wait a minute. That wasn't a hard eight! Last night I rolled a hard eight.
We got out pictures back from London. Here's all of us at the Tower of London.
Ok, let's see... uhm, okay, the turkey is in the oven, the stuffing is ready...
Okay, now this one is rare, this one is medium well! Now go-go-go! Hey Phoebe!
Oh, that's great! I mean I'm-I'm sorry, but I'm so happy for you. And now I can work for you!
No! Wait! If anybody gets to go.. it's us We've been complaining the longest!
Oh, I'm sorry. Of course I mean that. Interesting idea, umm, talk about it, but no.
Hey, don't say that! You got just as good a chance as anybody else of getting that job!
No, I want you to have a job that you love. Not statistical analysis and data reconfiguration.
Hey! Oh, I'm so glad you're home, I thought tonight we could finally organize these photos!
So how does this work, you going to balance the plates on these little guys' heads?
My Sweet Sixteen! Remember, you went to third base with my cousin Charlie.
Okay, I'm sorry. I think I can walk the rest of the way now. Just-just give me my boots.
Oh my God! Look at all the newspapers! It must be a good review! Is it great?!
Oh. Thank you. Ohhh, thank you very much. Oh, thank you for coming. Uh, just a second!
Okay, I've got a question. If you had to pick one of us to date, who would it be?
Mom and dad just sent me in here to find out if you were trying to get Ross stoned!
But the minute we start to lie to each other... And by 'we' I mean society.
It's almost 8 o'clock, it's almost past his bedtime. Where-where is he?
Well that's because you always sleep to noon, silly! This is what 9 looks like.
Maybe because it's you hung your head out of the window like a dog the whole ride here.
So how you doing today? Did you sleep okay? Talk to Barry? I can't stop smiling.
Oh-ho! But not in here! Can't eat 'em in bed, remember? No crumbies!
Get all freaked out because everybody was talking and just joking around about marriage and stuff.
No, there is no way! It can not be Ross! Unbelievable! Why is your family Scottish?!
Y'know what? I'm gonna make this up to you. I promised you a stripper , and you're gonna get a stripper.
No, I've had second thoughts about that. Do you realize how hard that would be to clean?
I don't, I just, I just like the smell of them. So, uh, what are you really doing here Dad?
It's a stupid game and I wasn't playing against other people, so technically I didn't lose.
Hey Tim? I need a calamari and a Caesar salad. And umm, could you get me the pesto?
Wasn't it a lot more exciting when we were y'know all over each other all the time?
Remember back in freshman year? Well, Billy Dreskin and I had sex on your bed.
This is for the scratchy twins out there. I taped oven mits to their hands.
I cant believe you. You still havent told that girl she doesnt have a job yet?
Nope, sound like me. Pheebs, it's going great. Look at Chandler with little baby girl Chandler.
Yeah-Oh that's right. You, you always wanted me too. Hey, I see you got your mustache back.
I thought it might be true. And I was afraid that you were gonna cry and then show it to me.
Am I doing here? Why? Surprised to see me? Ross brought me. How do you like that?!
Well, well Ross didn't care enough to be here, so I think he's out. You snooze you lose.
Well, an-anyway, I just-that night meant a lot to me, I guess I'm just trying to say thanks.
Okay, he's a lawyer, who teaches sculpting on the side. And- he can dance!
Ross is really strong! Okay, he's the strongest out of all three of you! Except for Joey.
Wow, for a guy who's recently lost his job, you're in an awfully good mood.
So big deal, so Joey's had a lot of girlfriends, it doesn't mean he's great in bed.
Okay. Okay, I got one. Do you remember that vegetarian pate that I made that you loved so much?
Yes. Yes, I was. A guy. From work. I'm seeing a guy from work! Ha!
The woman that got married a bunch of times and killed herself when you were 13?
Do I go horseback riding in the park? Do I take classes at the New School?
I can't wait to be with you! I'll just tell Rachel I'm gonna be doing laundry for a couple of hours.
Is-is-is that message old or new? Old or new?! Old or new?!
Hello! Organic substances recently discovered in the depths of the rain forest!
And say what? "You owe me a goodbye", I mean, he's got more pride than that.
Well, this is the last box of your clothes. I'm just gonna label it, "What were you thinking?"
I promise. Hey, speaking of together, how about we send out a holiday card this year?
What you guys don't understand is, for us, kissing is as important as any part of it.
My brother's going through that right now, he's such a mess. How did you get through it?
Well, I'm sorry, but Chandler and I could really use a weekend away. You know, to reconnect... emotionally.
Hold on a second, just put a little club soda on it and it should umm, be.....
That's weird. I've had the same number of beers as you and I don't feel anything at all.
Oh, by the way. Would it be okay if I gave the toast to mom and dad this year?
You're supposed to find your passion in life. You can be whatever you wanna be now. It's exciting.
Look, I don't even know how I feel about him yet. Just give me a chance to figure that out.
Rachel, I have not missed one question the whole game. I own this game! Look at my hand.
And for our two-week anniversary, he's gonna take me to his cousin's cabin for the weekend.
Oh, you can have an accent and I can't?! Top 'O the morning to ya laddies!
Come on Rach, come on. Let's see what's it like to be on a winning team for a change.
Alright, well, maybe I should let you and the second prettiest girl in Oklahoma get back to work.
Y'know, in my defense, umm there was no glitter on the macaroni and very little glue.
Yeah, well I might be if I had the supplies! I mean, I could do all this stuff. Only I don't.
Come on. Hello? I'm sorry you have the wrong number. Okay, I'll call you later dad. I love you.
Yeah but it was because I-I had an eye exam and I don't like my new eye doctor.
You wanna meet some people? This is uh; this is my husband Chandler. Chandler, this is Will.
No Chandler, you don't understand! Okay! Okay! Okay! Fine! Now you know. Okay? I'm y'know...I'm sick.
What?! I thought he'd love it! His favorite kid's book was the Velveteen Rabbit!
Well, if I had them taken out, then I wouldn't be able to do this. You like that, right?
Um, okay, here it goes. I'm not 22. I'm, I'm 25... and thirteen months.
Well Ross, you be careful now. You don't want to get a reputation as y'know Professor McNailshisstudents.
Yeah, tacos! Ever since you told me that story I've had such a craving for them.
Perhaps, you would like me to turn like this, so that you can bunny bump against my back.
Especially the after taste, you know, I'll tell ya, that'll last ya till Christmas.
I hope by maid you mean mistress, because if some other woman was here cleaning then...
No! Everything's cold. The turkey's dried out and the... the stuffing is all soggy.
I just tell her, I have to get it over with. I told Ross and Phoebe and she's the only one left!
No, I don't even know how serious he is about me. Until I do, I'm not telling them anything.
Oh, I guess we could try that, but... it seems so harsh! Have you ever done that?
Umm, when I said that uh, that Chandler and I wanted to umm, live together we meant alone together.
Okay, those people just left, come on! Quick! Give him the money and get their table!
That's crazy! . I am sorry. I just can't imagine giving up my one wedding day like that!
Why not! This is her wedding day, this is way more important than some stupid kids!
Mom's here? I wanted to have lunch with her today, she told me she was out of town.
Okay, just wait, please. I promise we'll come up with something. Just give us a little more time.
Phoebe and Rachel saw you with Nancy today and... em... they think you're having an affair.
When I fall asleep on the couch after reading, she covers me over with a blanket.
Chandler, you don't wanna miss this. This is the birth of your child! It's the miracle of life!
I'm so sorry that you had to find out this way. I'm sorry, but iit-t's true, I love him too.
Oh, he's sober alright. Just turns out that Fun Bobby was fun for a reason.
We should get over there and see if she's okay. Just one...second! Score! Game! Come on.
Rachel, you can go down there, you don't have to smoke. Just say you wanna get some fresh air.
Hello...? Oh hi... Oh my God...! Really...? I can't wait to tell Chandler... Ok, goodbye.
Well, the turkey's burnt. Potatoes are ruined, potatoes are ruined, potatoes are ruined.
Well...honestly ever since we got engaged I have been waiting for something to, to flip you out.
Look, guys, you can't do this, it's just going to make getting over each other, that much harder.
Yeah, but her plane got delayed in Athens. But actually, she should be here by now.
Phoebe! You're sick, you shouldn't play. You should just go home, get in bed, and stay there.
Honey, thanks for trying to figure out a way, but if you're going to Tulsa, I wanna go with you.
Because your all gonna make up fake specials and make me cook them like you did the other night?
Oh my God. You guys! You gotta come see this! There's some creep out there with a telescope!
Yes it is. You see I've always found the men's bathroom very sexual. Haven't you?
Oh, that's Nana, right there in the middle. 'Me and the gang at Java Joe's'.
Well, at least you're not hearing it for the first time at your fifth grade Halloween party.
Chandler, wait. It goes: Old job, new job, you. This is just something I have to do.
Unless... Maybe we do it here. I mean, how much can she even be aware of at this age?
Umm, why don't you give me something that would be a good reason and-and then I'll tell you if it's true.
I can't believe it! She's asleep! I got her to go to sleep! I have actual magical powers!
Oh my God, my ass is sweating! Please! Please! Can you come? It's today at four.
Ok! When I go places with high humidity, it gets a little extra body, ok?!
Okay, but all right you're a guy, does it not freak you that you're never gonna sleep with anybody else?
Honey, as we get closer to the wedding, is there anything that you would like to talk about or share?
You're right. I mean I'm sorry. Yeah, I shouldn't be laughing. I should be laying down papers for you!
Wait a minute, you got Ross Gellar and guest?! I wasn't invited and you got "and guest?!"
Oh my God Stu! I-I can't believe you did this! Now are you absolutely sure she's a hooker?
Wow! Wow! And it's definitely all gone? There's nothing there to work with? What were you thinking?
Yeah but see I have nothing to compare it too. So even if you're horrible, how would I know?
: Is this not the good part? Do you want me to fast forward to something a little toothier.
Y'know what we should do? We should all get dressed up and go to have champagne at The Plaza.
And Dad, y'know that mailman that you got fired? He didn't steal your Playboys! Ross did!
She's just upset because she, uh, she buttered a spider into her toast this morning.
Oh my God. Wait a minute, I had them put... Oh my God! It's in the quiche! Oh My God!
All right. But umm, I-I-I'll pay you back all the money you invested, and you can keep the van.
Oh, hi, Ross. Yeah. There's someone I want you to say hi to. He just happened to call.
Oh come on, it's only fair, you paid for the flight. Now is, is that enough lire?
So I hide in the shower and the next thing you know they're going at it right on the bathroom floor.
In one year?! My God what did she eat? Her-her family! That's not the point.
Oh my God, that place has the creamiest frosting! I use to hitchhike there when I was a kid.
Hi sweetie, look before I forget, did I leave my diaphram at your place? Hi mom.
It was Laura... She gave us a great report and we are officially on the waiting list.
So, do you guys wanna come and eat dinner at the restaurant sometime in the next few weeks?
Now, most guys will hit uh, 1-2-3 and then go to 7 and set up camp.
I will! But not tonight. For dinner music, I thought we could listen to that tape you made me.
It was, it was really nice. We started talking and I-I ended up having lunch with him.
Oh, so much fun. But the best part is, we met this incredible couple on the way back.
Oh, I love this street. The trees, the big front yards, the actual picket fences.
Thank you! You haven't said anything... 3rd Customer: Actually I do have one small complaint.
No you didn't. Oh and honey just so you know, now that you're marrying me, you don't get to win anymore.
Oh umm, how about your mom dying, or having to live on the streets when you were 14?
All right! Let's go! Let's go Team Monica! All right, we can work out the name later.
How she drove you crazy, picking on every little detail, like your hair... for example.
Yeah, well he's my brother! And plus he drives so slow he could never hurt it.
Okay, I'll be back in just a minute. Oh, Phoebe I'm sorry that I left lipstick marks on the phone.
So what! As long as he's not wearing a white dress and a veil I don't care.
Y'know what shoes would look great with this ring? Diamond shoes! You're not getting dressed.
They can't all be bad. Find the one where you make your bedroom eyes. Ohh, there it is.
We think if you saw it, you'd understand. I mean you guys were there. It is beautiful, isn't it?
: Honey look we can do something else, do you want me to get into the tub and thrash.
Okay, guys! The candy is coming; I just need another 15 minutes for the chocolate to cool!
David, can you help me?! I'm trying to explain to Chandler how a plane stays in the air.
We're supposed to uh, be spending a romantic weekend together, it-it, what is the matter with you?
Wow, so you guys are, you're never gonna be in the same room together? How is that even gonna work?
2 minutes, 12 pies and a part of one tin! Okay, I see you guys at 4.
So uh, Joey and Chanlder, I, I think it's time that you take Dr. Greene over to your place.
Oh, it was great! The widow wouldn't pay, so Phoebe yelled at her 'til she did.
Ok, I'll tell you what. How about I cook dinner at my place? I'll make it just like Mom's.
They baked it. I can't take this anymore. I'm gonna call a meeting tonight, I'm gonna fire you tonight.
Hey, waitwait, aren't you the guy that plays the butt in the new Al Pacino movie?
I don't believe this! When someone asks you in for lemonade, and to you that means they wanna have sex?
I hope you're hungry, we're starting with oysters. And y'know what they say about oysters, don't you?
Can we turn the TV off? Okay? Do we really want to spend the entire weekend like this?
Okay. Wait, just give me a second, I need to just get my boots off first. Ah...Ooh...Oohh...Ohh...Oh God...Ohh...Oh...Ohh...Ohhhh...
Ok. Great. I am so glad that you are here. We're really excited about getting this process started.
I can't believe you're dressing up for him. I mean, you're just, you're setting yourself up all over again.
Now I'm guessing that he bought her the big pipe organ, and she's really not happy about it.
All right!! All right. I got stung. Stung bad. I couldn't stand. I-I couldn't walk.
Oh thanks. Champagne, strawberries...Oh my God! I can't believe Chandler ordered porn on our wedding night!
Come on guys! Suck it up! We're closing in on ten hours! It's gut-check time!
Yeah. I think you have to draw him out. And then- when you do- he's a preppy animal.
I think he is fine! It's just that we don't know anything real about him... we should get more information.
You know, they're not actually supposed to have... I'll work on the lumps. Joey, you're going home, right?
Oh, what about that guy over there? Remember? That is the guy you flirted with at the counter that time.
Umhmm, umhmm, about the time you told me about New Year's Eve. Where is everybody else?
That was not an incident! I-I was gesturing, a-and the plate slipped out of my hand.
Okay, look, I-I have enough stuff for one more sandwich, I mean I was going to eat it myself, but
Hey, Rach. How was it with your friends? Okay! How would you like some Tiki Death Punch?
If it makes anybody feel better, then we can just forget the thing, and we'll just do the gift.
Oh y'know what? If you're gonna be acting like this all night, I really, I don't even want to be around you.
Um, I straightened out your shower curtain so you won't get mildew. What? To me that's nice.
I just checked my messages, and he said that when he gets back from Atlanta, we need to talk.
Of course there's another guy!! This is even more perfect! Now you have to prove your love!
Hey, it is unreasonable to expect a child to wait for a light bulb to cook brownies!
You know what would be real weird? Is if you weren't there. Just say you'll think about it, okay?
What about all the guys that you've got the phone numbers from? Why don't you just kiss one of them?
All right. I know you're not happy about us moving, but you're the only one who hasn't seen the house.
So, Mr. Rastatter, what exactly does this job entail? The ad wasn't too clear.
Well if Ted Kopel talked about his coworkers botched boob jobs, I would.
Sweetie, with you it's gonna be different. The sex is gonna be great, 'cause you-you guys are in love.
Rach, you're in a great place in your life. Come on, you've got a great job! Good friends...
Oh, I'm sorry honey, you know, but when she said "sex" I wasn't thinking about "sex with you"!
Whoa! Whoa!! Tackled by a girl! Bet ya don't see that everyday, do ya?
Wow, this is so weird. I just realized this might be the last time we'll all be hanging out together.
Really. Well, at least 'big girls' don't pee in their pants in seventh grade!
Okay. I gotta call Michelle. I gotta see if that was her voice or not. I'm sorry, I just have to.
Limited seating! Oh, that is such a lame excuse! That's not the reason she's not inviting me!
So if everyone liked it, and you liked it, that would make this a success. Which would make you...
Look at us all dressed up for the big office party! By the way, what are we celebrating?
Well, she corned me! She asked if the wedding was in town! I mean, what was I supposed to do?!
Oh, I wish there was a job where I could wear this all the time. Maybe someday, there will be.
Okay, if Joey does the ceremony, then we have to find someone else to walk Phoebe down the isle.
That's better. 90 seconds is a long time not to think about it...except all I did was think about it.
Did you not hear where my head was? Come on! Come on we're a team! We're in this together!
Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- -I'd want yours.
I have no moves. Okay, whatcha doin' there?! Oh y'know what? I'm sorry, this is just too weird.
I couldn't eat it! I had five friends who couldn't eat it, and one of them eats books.
Oh yeah, I got soap and sponges and rags and Carnuba wax and polishing compound.
Fine, you can have the bath, but I am taking your boat. Now you're just a girl in a tub!
Come on! Tests make us all better learners! Oh yeah! We should have essay questions!!
Alright. If you guys don't want it to be special, fine. You can throw any kind of party you want.
Hi, good morning lover. I gotta say after last night, I'm a little weak in the knees.
You know what? It seems like you've been making an awful lot of stuff Irish lately.
So I made snacks. Please, just hang out okay? I'm just gonna rest my eyes just a little bit.
I'm so sorry, I can't believe I did this, but I couldn't stop laughing at your Norman Mailer story.
I am going... I'm going--Turn it over! I'm... I am going to get these drops in your eyes.
You guys haven't gotten your presents yet? Tomorrow's Christmas Eve, what're ya gonna do?
And he came at us with an axe, so Rachel had to use a bug bomb on him!
Alright, you know, we got it, we got it. Let's play for real. High stakes... big bucks...
No, it's okay, not only did I get to go out with Chip Matthews, I got to dump Chip Matthews.
It will be my pleasure. My guy has diplomatic coupons. Your guy can't even say coupons.
Hey, hey, look. Look Ross, Ben drew a picture of you! Huh? You're-you're a cowboy!
No! No it's not! It's not gonna be okay! It sucks! No swing band! No lilies!
Didn't you listen to the story? I mean, this is twisted! How could you get involved with a woman like this?
: yea well the weird part is... he was getting off to a shark attack show!
Mmm, looking good. Ok, cider's mulling, turkey's turking, yams are yamming. What?
Wait a minute! So you told people I was pregnant?! Does this look like a conversation that I want to remember?!
Yeah... Yeah, I know it's pretty selfish, but haha, hey, that's me. Why don't you try the hummus?
Well, given that we forgot to invite her it would be an awfully big coincidence if she was.
Well, I was thinking, that you gave the guys such great haircuts, I thought, maybe you'd like to do mine?
Oh, well, I bought Chandler a five hundred dollar watch and he wrote me a rap song.
Ugh, we're screwed, aren't we? You know what? Just tell me on the way to the bird store.
Okay! I'll be right out. I'm slipping into something a little less comfortable, and a little more slutty.
All right, I'll go down there. But, I'm not gonna serve the lasagna. I'm gonna serve something I make.
Alright, but I'm very excited about this OK, so you gotta promise you won't get all big-brothery and judgmental.
You don't think that umm, "The chef's Mahi Mahi was awful awful," is bad press?
Pheebs, you've been up for 24 hours! Go to sleep, honey. Th-this isn't healthy.
All right... you're right. We're sorry. Now let's wake up Emma and get the fun time started!
Hello? It's Joey. I'm so glad you called! Chandler told me what happened. Y'know he's really upset about it.
Look, all we're trying to say is, don't let what happened with Carol ruin what you got with Emily.
And then Chandler was, was really sweet and he consoled me. And well we drank too much...
No, to get a table! Places like are always shakin' you down. Everybody wants to be paid off.
Because it would totally freak him out and tomorrow's our anniversary. I just don't want anything to spoil that.
Ohh, this is soo amazing! I can't believe my brother's getting married! And in London! It's so romantic!
That's right. That's right. And that is why you can't stay here tonight. And probably why you shouldn't come to the wedding.
I think the things that you said about me are really unfair, and I would like for you to give my bouillabaisse another chance.
All right, there's some pizza at my place, we can all eat with one hand right? Are you with me?
Please? Please?! We just don't want to deal with telling everyone, okay? Just promise you won't tell.
Okay. But wait, we can't. My Cousin Cassie is in the guest room, we're supposed to have lunch.
That's right! Maybe it's time you took a good hard look at a mirror young lady...old lady...lady!
You know it's funny, the last time Paulo was here, my hair was so much shorter and cuter.
That's right. I'm no longer a bride. I'll never be a bride again. Now, I'm just someone's wife!
Okay, now Thanksgiving's over, let's get ready for Christmas. Who wants to go get a Christmas tree?!
What are you talking about? She obviously lives on the second floor, seventh apartment from the left!
Can you believe it? ...Y'know what? I just don't feel the thing. I mean, they feel the thing, I don't feel the thing.
Look, doctor! Look, before we sign anything we really have to talk... We're not who you think we are.
All right, so I haven't cleared the budget with my parents yet, but tell me how this is for music.
Wait-wait!! Okay, stop it! Stop it! Stop! Now listen, no one's gonna fight in this apartment.
Oh, you mean like that guy thing where you act mean and distant until you get us to break up with you.
Look , I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have.
Umm, so how long have you been working with your dad? Come on, one of us had to mention him.
Oh, then bring it on! Oh, unless of course your afraid you might lose to a bunch of girls.
Y'know when girls sleep with guys with weird things on their body, they tell their friends about it.
Well, I actually had the weirdest conversation with Joey. He was talking about rules and right and wrong and...
Oh, I don't know. Maybe, um, "That was nice?" Admit something to me? "I'll call you?"
Bouncy baby, Bouncy baby, Ooh baby baby, Ooh baby baby, Ooh baby baby.
Well, uh y'know, our guy works with Chandler and he's really nice and smart and he's a great dresser!
And then we're gonna have a little Middle Eastern cous-cous. Something we can eat, with our hands.
Okay, I'm gonna go check on something across the hall. You start by washing these Not with soap!!
Well, umm, Walker was looking for this big bus load of kids.... All right, I get your point.
Is this the video of the baby being born? Sweetie, this is Phoebe's. Why were you even watching it?
: Here why don't you sit down, get yourself comfortable because I. have a little surprise for you.
Nothin', nothin', hey you're a cheapasaurus. I'm kidding, I'm kidding, thank you, I'm very greatful.
Oh really? Okay? Well what would you say if I told you that, y'know, Ross or Chandler could beat you up?
But getting over was the hardest thing that I've ever had to do. And I never let myself think about you.
All right everybody! Everybody guess what? I just convinced Paul to give us a test next week!
Rachel, if you want the little round waffles, you gotta have to wait until I find the little waffle iron.
It's beautiful! It's like the first bathroom floor there ever was. Whoa! Are you going in there for?
Really? Wow, well then come on, I wanna show you how to fold the toilet paper into a point.
Oh! Why didn't you tell me? I made him his own individual sweet potato stuffed pumpkin.
Phoebe! Rachel! It's Monica! I wonder what you could possibly need me for on such short notice! Oh.
-but that wouldn't be fair to me, it wouldn't be fair to Alan- It wouldn't be fair to you!
How many perfectly fine women are you gonna reject over the most superficial insignificant things?
The muscles from Brussels, wham bam Van Damme, did you see Time Cop?
Yeah.. uh, but for future reference, that thing in your hand can also be used as a phone.
You have nothing! You're not even going out! You're her baby sitter! You have a 12-year-old girl's job!
You better believe he's tired, after the day we had! If you know what I mean. You know what I mean?
Oh my God! You own an Italian restaurant and you think that tastes good?! Where are you even from?
Okay, how about the fact that he's engaged to another woman, who just happens to be your ex-best friend?
Ok listen, you go down to the pool and reserve the chairs, and I'll get the magazines and the lotion.
Oh my God. Okay, go into the bathroom, use whatever you want, just don't ever tell me what you did in there.
Okay. Umm, y'know, I don't think, I don't think I told you this, but umm, I just got out of a really serious relationship.
You gotta go home and get the earrings that you borrowed from me okay? Chandler wants me to wear them tonight.
Ok, let's see... Oh, the cranberry sauce, it is easy to make and no-one really cares about it.
Ross! That is so sweet of you to get Phoebe that bike! When I heard the story, I almost cried.
Okay, so, uh, we're in France, we're making the toast. Do you see a little bassinet in the corner?
Yeah but I was just screwing with you to try to get your voice all high and weird like mine is now!
Well you-you did start that rumor about Ross making out with Mrs. Altman, our 50-year-old librarian.
She picked Rachel. I mean, she tried to back out of it, but it was obvious. She picked Rachel.
He was in Ross's class...marching band...kinda overweight? Well, really overweight. I mean I was his thin friend.
No-no-no, that's a video-phone. But hey guys you're not supposed to be here, so please, do not touch anything.
Phoebe, relax none of that stuff ever happens! They just put it on there for legal reasons!
Oh, I know. I know. Hey, you know, you can take it if you want! The lease is still in Nana's name.
Would you look at them. Am I ever gonna find a boyfriend again? I gonna die an old maid.
Okay, come on, I can't get married until I get something old, something new, something borrowed, and something blue.
No. No you can't go. No this is fun. Come on we're just getting started. Here, here's your marker.
No honey. You have to sleep on this side of the bed because I have to sleep on this side of the bed.
Doctor, can I see you for just a minute please? My brother has a slight phobia about needles.
Joey, put that down! Oh my God! It's Pete. Okay, get out!! How the hell do you answer a video-phone!
Wait a minute...Joey. Joey you can't ask her out, she's your roommate. It-it'll be way too complicated.
Really well. Yeah. Surprisingly well. Yeah, she didn't cry. She wasn't angry or sad.
Hi. We're buying the house next door, and we were wondering if we could just take a look around.
I'm gonna hang this basket on the door and when the neighbors walk by they can all take a piece.
Hand me those tomatoes, I'm gonna show you what it should taste like! Come on, hand me them.
Wow, all you need now is The Killing Fields and some guacamole and you've got yourself a part-ay.
Phoebe, it's not what you wear. It's sort of your songs... I just don't think you should play at the restaurant anymore.
But either way... You're gonna get married, you're gonna be happy, my mom's gonna like you better than me.
Hello, this is Monica... Yeah??? Oh... Okay, yes, we'll be right, we'll be right down. Thank you.
Y'know, I-I-I don't think that I can. So if you don't mind, maybe this will be it for me on the work things.
Come on Chandler, come on! It'll give us great practice for when--people with babies come to visit.
What am I gonna do?! That is the dress! That is the dress! Wh...Chandler wants the band. What do I do?
Ya know, Roy saw Star Wars 317 times. His name was in the paper.
Now Joey, you go down there and you suck up to him. I mean you suck like you've never sucked before!
Really, Rachel, I was thinking of you the whole time. Look, I'm sorry, all right. I never meant for you to find out!
Oh really, you want to talk about quality? Have you heard of a key? It's what some people sing in.
Oh yeah, the Evander Holyfield phase. Oh man you were so hard up you practically came on to me.
Oh, Phoebe, she couldn't stop crying! With those thick glasses, her tears looked giant.
"Take me to the mansion in the sky-y". I am sorry, the song is over. Did you see me out there?
Phoebe is going to say "Yes" to David. See, that's what happens when you meddle in people's lives!
That's mine!! Now, would you both please start acting like adults? And get me my cough drops!
Wow! You might just get the first Nobel prize in rubbing. So what country is this guy from?
I gotta make up the guest bedroom. Hey, Cousin Cassie is coming to stay with us a few days.
No. It disappears back there behind that baseboard. For a minute there, I thought it went downstairs.
Okay, just back off mister! Whoa. 'Cause I am ready to have a baby. I just want Joey to be the father.
You know that's nice, y'know we could put it back there after the surgeons remove it from your colon!
For your information, ass munch, I've lost four pounds. Maybe even five with all the dancing.
Oh now that-that-that's funny, it seems like Chandler's conference could've been in Connecticut or Vermont.
What if I have babies, okay? I mean I'm gonna look different. I'm okay with that, but I'm not sure that you are!
Oh! Ohhhhh! Oh! Phoebe, come here. Aw, this is my new bed. You gotta feel this bad boy.
It is in the living room where there is also a light! And no one will kick you in the shin.
Look at me! My big concern is what's real?! Oh my God. We're really sad, aren't we?
Hey, I just whipped us up some Easy Bake treats, they should be ready in about three days.
Nice work everybody! So much for the y'know, "You can drive it, but don't tell Rachel" plan!
Well I think the length of teasing is directly related to how insane you were so, a long time.
Alright, I'll tell you what. I'll come get you in 5 minutes with some sort of um, kabob emergency.
Well, it's the thought. Hey, doesn't Ross's flight get in in a couple hours? At gate 27-B?
Look what I got! Look what I got! Look what I got! Can you believe they make these for little people?
I know. But umm, one time there was this really dirty car in front of the building, so I washed it.
Oh, no! I mean, obviously we want to see you take your clothes off! You big piece of eye candy!
No Joey! Chandler could be your assistant! See, he could answer all of your fan mail and stuff!
All right. Now do it soon, he just asked me how to convert his dollars into Vermont money.
Hey, you better hope that we're pregnant, because one way or another, we're giving a baby back to Rachel.
No, no! We should divide them up and I should get extra because we used my card to buy them!
I am not 'so'! OK, I was a teensy bit weird at first, but... I'll be good. I promise.
That's Paul's watch. You just put it back where you found it. Oh boy. Alright. Goodnight, everybody.
All right, look, I hate this as much as you, but if it makes you feel better, it's all your fault.
But I figured, you know, that shouldn't change anything. I mean, what the hell does it matter how old we are.
uh huh.. I mean these things happen. Its' just a plate. Its not like somebody died.
Now we just have to wait for a call and... and someone tells us there's a baby waiting for us. Oh...
Well, maybe you should send him something. So that when he gets to Las Vegas he'll know that you're sorry.
Okay, well, we have to get past this! Why don't we get rid of the tape and pretend it never existed?
Come here. I'll make you feel like one of the guys. You know for a really cool guy, you suck at foosball.
I'll get it. Hello. Hi Emily! Yeah, uh you-you tracked him down. Hold on one second.
All right, fine. Tonight's potatoes will be both mashed with lumps, and in the form of tots.
Hey! Do you think that we can get to the subway right there if we climb down through the manhole cover?
Yeah! All right, maybe you don't have to smile. Let's try something else. Let's try umm, try looking sexy.
You know, on the way over here, I saw this drunk guy throw up. And then a pigeon ate it!
No! That's where we keep the canned goods! Have you completely forgotten everything you learned at orientation?
Alright, well, this does not change anything. Okay, we need to get something to grease the sides of his face.
What is the matter with you?! Do you want to fall into the trap? Do you want to fall into the trap?!
No! Wait! I think I can figure out the recipe from this cookie! I do stuff like this at work all the time.
Ok, the first person's most embarassing memory is, 'Monica, your party sucks.' Very funny.
So whenever you're ready to apologize to me, I will forgive you. Good day! I can't feel my legs!
Um, well, I was going to, I-I-I really was. But um, then somewhere, just out of nowhere, I didn't.
Oh! Oh my God! That is the most beautiful top of a head I have ever seen! Chandler, you have to see this!
No, it doesn't, does it? But you wanted lumps, Ross? Well, here you go, buddy, ya got one.
Oh my God, sit down! Sit down! How long as it been since we've seen each other?
: Hey Rach its me ok I just got the Chandler's room and I caught him molesting himself.
Alright, for the bizillionth time, yes I see other women in shower at the gym, and no I don't look.
What?! You can't shed a tear for your dead wife!! Now, I left you a note from the beyond!
We were on the platform, ready to dance the world into the new Millennium, and the guy yelled 'CUT!'
This is so bizarre. I guess it kinda makes sense though, y'know she had such a terrible childhood.
My god, if I had a nickel for every guy I wish I hadn't..., but this is about your horrible mistake.
Oh sure, now you're Mister Sensitivity. But when you wanted to have sex right after my uncle's funeral.
Drunk enough to know that I want to do this. Not so drunk that you should feel guilty about taking advantage.
Oh, just some pictures I made and hung up. I thought they'd brighten up the place. They do don't you think?
So the wedding caterer sent me this list of twelve appetizers and I have to narrow it down to six.
Ugh, I can not believe this! I mean, who is she to judge us? We could not have been nicer to her!
So Nancy told me about this job at this great restaurant, Javo . It's just a little outside of Tulsa.
Yeah, you're my husband. I'm not gonna live in a different state than you for 208 days out of the year.
Okay that's it. I give up. At mom and dad's 40th anniversary, you're the one giving the speech.
Well, spring vacation is doing nice things with your grandparents. Spring break you're doing frat guys.
I'm sorry, okay. It's just that Chandler has somebody, and Phoebe has somebody- I thought I'd ask Fun Bobby.
Well, every, every Thanksgiving um, we used to have a touch football game called the 'Geller Bowl.'
Oh, you must be freezing. You know what you need? How about a nice steaming cup of hot Mockolate?
It says "Do it!". And behold she did adopt onto them a baby. And it was good.
You're the most incredible woman I've ever met. How can I lose you? Now, I don't actually have a ring...
Because! She's my cousin. I mean, we grew up together! We're family y'know? Well that's important to me.
No. If you thought this mess is going to bother me, you are wrong! All right, let's go Blinky! Chandler!!!!
Ow! Oh, that sounds nice! I am just there for jury duty. They really spruce that place up!
Damnit! Y'know this whole time we were concentrating on watching the babies and, and no one was watching Chandler!
Wow, isn't it ironic that David would show up on the same day that you and Mike exchange keys?
Wow. Y'know it is so weird. I mean, you're gonna tell this guy today and he has no idea what's gonna happen.
Me too! Yeah, Chandler can't stand it. He won't even allow me to have blue cheese in the house.
Please, when he left town you stayed in your pajamas for a month and I saw you eat a cheeseburger.
Believe me, Chandler and I have not seen each other in over a week. We'll probably be the first ones there.
Sorry! I'm just-I'm not very good at this! I'm a terrible liar and I hate having to lie to Rachel!
Y'know, it is so strange seeing Ross here this time of day, 'cause usually he's got the children's hospital.
Ross, but me down for another box of the mint treasures, okay. Where, where are the mint treasures?
All right, it'll be great! You just make her think you wanna have sex with her! It'll totally freak her out!
Did you just hung up on me? All right, look, I need you at the rehearsal dinner tonight at 1800 hours.
We're going to Las Vegas to see your dad. It's time you two talked, and I want to get to know my father-in-law.
It is nothing like the Hobbit. It's like reading about every relationship I've ever had, except for Richard.
MEG was good for me but I dumped her. Ya know, my motto is get out before they go down.
Okay, just stay there a couple more hours and if she doesn't show up by then, then just come on home.
Have you lost your mind? Chandler, this isn't about me! This is about you and all your weird relationship commitment crap!
Look at that! Look at that! They're going into the first class lounge! Do you know what they have in there?
God! Look at all these tickets! It's so exciting! You know I haven't won anything since the sixth grade.
Oh, well don't take it to the same place you took the stereo, 'cause they've had that thing for over a week.
Two guys in one night? Wow, I thought she became a slut after she got her nose fixed.
No, it just remind me of something this guy did today at work. I told you about that funny guy, Geoffrey, right?
Okay, Okay, All right. What if we got both houses? Huh? We can turn this house into a guest house.
Well what is it? What is it? If it's gonna help bring the baby here, like today. I mean, I think you should do it.
I am so glad you guys got together, Chandler and I are always looking for a couple to go out with and now we have one!
Maybe we could call the phone company. Maybe they could change the message. Maybe they can change his number.
Rachel would be Phoebe's, I would be Rachel's, that way we all get to do it once and no one would get upset.
Yeah and you better watch the flirting too, cause you know, in such close quarters, it could be trouble.
Y'know what, don't tell us. We'll just wait until Chandler gets home, because it'll be more fun that way.
Alright, lets say that it is him, would we not want the baby? No! Would we treat him any differently?
Oh! Let's see, well...if this is the wedding hall then umm you're parents will be at home in Queens.
Having a perfectly decorated tree is not what Christmas is about. It's about being with the people that you love.
I mean, you're the one they're gonna come to when they wanna run away from home, and the one they talk to about sex.
She's only a couple of months pregnant. She liked our application but who knows if she's gonna like us.
You're going to talk to him! Y'know what? We made a deal, I make your decisions and I say you're going to talk to him.
Ok, you see, the tag shouldn't be at the top left corner, it should be at the bottom right corner.
Ah no, you see, someone was supposed to take them down around New Years... but obviously someone forgot.
So, if you're parents hadn't got divorced, you'd be able to answer a question like a normal person?
Okay, everybody relax. This is not even a date. It's just two people going out to dinner and- not having sex.
You guys, I ordered some chocolate pies from that bakery on Bleecker. Could you pick them up for me?
Wow! You're a lot sturdier that Chandler. He crumpled like a piece of paper. So how was you're trip?
Am I on fire today or what?! Those birds are browned, basted, and ready to be carved!
Ok, my husband just gave your boyfriend some very bad advice. Look, David is going to propose to you tonight.
Oh, he is. And he is so dreamy. I mean, y'know what, when he left I actually used the phrase, 'Hummina-hummina-hummina.'
Did anybody else feel they just wanted to peel the skin off their body, to have something else to do?
Oh please! Yesterday on the subway? You couldn't stop staring at that woman with the big breasts the whole time.
Hi honey. We just got a wedding gift from Bob and Faye Bing; they don't like us do they?
Look at it! Ohhh! Wallpaper's a little faded, that's okay. Carpet's a little loose. Hardwood floors!!
"Hi I'm Rachel, is my sweater too tight? No? Oh, I'd better wash it and shrink it!"
Yeah. Go over to Joey's. Go over to Joey's and drink some beer and hammer up some drywall.
Oh, I know! Umm, is it because he's always correcting people's grammar? Whom! Whom! Sometimes it's who!
It's okay. I suppose it could happen to anyone, not anyone I know, but... By the way I can still see it.
Do you realize that four weeks from today we're getting married? Four weeks baby!! Four weeks!!!
Okay, we'll start with the building. You guys take the first and second floor, Phoebe and I'll take third and fourth.
Oh my god, Emma. Oh, sweetie, I forgot you were here. Oh, you're right, we can't do this. We can't leave her alone.
Would you stop? We've only been going out a couple of weeks, I mean we don't even know if he's gonna propose.
I can't believe you married Duncan. I mean how could you not tell me? We lived together, we told each other everything.
How do I tell Chandler that it's too soon. It's gonna break his heart, he's not gonna think that I don't love him anymore.
Okay you were right! All right, I never should have bought them! They're killing me! One toe at a time!
Chandler, this is crazy! What did you even say to him! "Come up, meet my wife! Give us your sperm"!
Does she use the cups? Yes! I believe she does. Does she use the plates? Yes! I believe she does.
So I'm not supposed to share my doubts and fears with the guy I'm gonna spend the rest of my life with?
Oh..please!I-I welcome criticism. 3rd Customer: The musician right outside the restaurant...it's kind of a mood-killer!
All right, I'm gonna show you something a lot of guys don't know. Rach, give me that pad, please? All right. Now...
Okay, looks like Ross and I are captains. Okay, so um, I bunnied first so that means I get to pick first. Joey.
Chandler, if that dog's been here that long, and you haven't had a reaction, maybe you're not allergic to this dog?
Well, I guess we should go back in. When you gave me another chance, I guess we should do the same for Amanda.
Oh, I so can't believe this! My uterus is an inhospitable environment? I was trying so hard to be a good hostess!
Oh no, you see we're on our honeymoon. So umm, can you do your little thing and bump us up to first class?
Anyway, it just doesn't seem worth it to make a whole turkey for just three people. Okay? It's a lot of work.
What? what? He obviously thinks that's a nice way to be proposed to, plus he'd never suspect it!
Okay. It's zero hour. All teams execute on my count. Let's get this bad boy on the road.
: do you know how many times I've seen him jump up like that, believe me I know what he was doing.
Yeah, ours pretty much sucked, oh, but, I did run into little Stevie Fisher. Remember him?
Let's take a walk. Y'know maybe you should consider writing for Talking Out of Your Ass magazine!
Okay listen, y'know when you move in Rachel's room is gonna be empty, you wanna talk about what we want to do with it?
Ok, I'm sensing that this is some kind of word play, because you are pink with barely controlled glee.
How great are you, you little saver?! I mean, the-the amount you have is exactly the budget of my dream wedding!
See? This is exactly why I'm making this candy. We can learn their names and get to know our neighbors.
Hello? No rejection? I got shot down at fat camp! Boy, kids are mean when they're hungry.
'Cause I just keeping thinking about all these things that I'm not gonna have and it's freaking me out. I don't know what to do about it.
Come on Phoebe, let's go! Come on, it's time to get serious, huddle up. Joey, keep your head in the game.
Hi, umm I know this is last minute, but we've decided to throw an impromptu baby shower for Rachel today.
Hey that reminds me, I thought we could use some extra luck so I brought a wishbone home from work.
'Cause they took our apartment, I wanted to punish them. But I'm-I'm done now. They've suffered enough.
No, honey, its. thats a special plate. See its a game, whoever gets that plate wins.
I-I-I'm sorry, your-your mouth was full, I didn't hear what you said. Umm, hats off to who now?
Isn't it? Then what about the amazing wainscotting and the crown molding and the dormer windows in the attic?
Yeah, well kinda cute, like really kinda cute, or kinda cute like your friend Spackel Back Larry?
Oh no-no-no, it's only one night a week, and plus I get to take all of you out for a lot of free dinners.
All right, let me see. Will Chandler have sex tonight? Don't count on it. Seems like it works to me.
I'm sorry. But not that sorry, 'cause you don't have to live with it. Um, we have a reservation under the name Chandler Bing.
Okay, y'know what? Don't worry, okay? We'll take care of it. We'll call her. Just go home and get ready.
I missed this apartment! Now, this is a grown-up's apartment! Y'know, I-I should be with a grown-up, do you know what I mean?!
How could you mess this up? It's so easy? You go into the booth, you count to five and you turn around!!
Hey. Okay, so umm, since that video camera thing didn't work out uh, I thought that I would give you just a little preview.
I can't do that either! The soles' are already a little scuffed up and the insides are filled with my blood.
You wanna finish this right now? All right, we get a deck of cards, high card wins. What do you say?
Uh, no. Loosely translated 'We should do this again' means 'You will never see me naked'.
You see, if we'd gone around them like I said, we-She would've given us those tickets. Damnit!
He just told me at the counter. He made me promise not to tell, but I couldn't hold it in any longer!
You see that guy? He's in classics now, but y'know as soon as we leave he's going straight to the porn.
No, I think we should save our china for something really special. Like if the Queen of England comes over.
Phoebe, your face is fine! Come on, none of this stuff is going to happen to you! Stop being such a baby!
You are so cute! No. No, it was a fight. You deal with it and move on! It's nothing to freak out about.
Hi, Ben. Hi. I'm your Aunt Monica. Yes I am. I'm your Aunt Monica. I...I will always have gum.
Ok first of all...It would be great. But that's not what I'm here to talk to you about. I need to borrow some money.
Deep Impact was the one with Robert Duval, Armageddon is what's going to happen to you if you wake me up.
Yeah, we switched meat suppliers at work, and the new guys gave me the steaks as sort of a thank-you.
Abso... ...lutely. See, I love creating new recipes. I love Thanksgiving. And, well, now, I love Mockolate.
Because I need the money, and I thought that it'd be a great way to get rid of that last little schmidgen of self-respect.
And it could be soon. I mean, think about it: right now, somewhere out there our baby could be being conceived.
I don't know. I mean, you saw him do a love scene, so maybe you don't have a thing for Joey, maybe you have a thing for Drake.
Oh my God. That was so amazing! When did you Hold on! I almost forgot loser! When did you stop sucking?
Absolutely! Yes, you say to him "I'm sorry Mike I can't live without her, she means too much to me!"
All right, hold on okay? First thing's first. Okay, now did Ross sit anywhere while he was naked?
Isn't that sad? I mean, can you see how pathetic that is? You shouldn't be jealous. You should feel bad for him.
The strange part was, he was really nice, umm and he looks great, but I didn't feel anything at all!
Hey, it's Phoebe and Rachel. Um, why don't you tell them what you were telling me earlier about me not being high maintenance?
Oh it's so cute. I wonder what age it is when you stop being able to put both legs over your head.
What?! I mean, I didn't work this hard and-and-and lose all this weight so that I can give my flower to someone like him!
It's gonna be ok. Ryan's been under water. He's just gonna be so glad that you don't have barnicles on your butt.
So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks?
Oh wait, wait, unless you happened to catch the Reruns' production of Pinocchio, at the little theater in the park.
Sex! This is the last day I'm ovulating, and when we don't do it now, we'll have to wait till next month.
Y'know in a weird way, you have too much power. Look, you're gonna have to help me out here, 'cause I only have three.
Oh, I know, I never wear fake ones. I just did it so my Mom wouldn't give me grief about me biting them.
Oh my God! Oh, this is incredible! Ohh! All right, y'know what? I'm just gonna roll right into that office and-and quit!
This is so wild. Ya know, I gotta admit, I was kinda surprised that you agreed to go on a blind date.
Hey Rach, the adoption agency needs letters of recommendation and we were wondering if you would write one for us.
Wow! Look At This! I Can'T Believe I Even Fit Into This Shirt! Oh, this is yours.
No, he's not. And if I can't get pregnant with you, then I don't want to get pregnant by... him or anyone else.
Well, at least you have one thing to be happy about. That jerk Gavin from your office didn't show up .
It is so great to meet a guy who is smart and funny, and has an emotional age beyond, like eight.
I don't know, my hand feels weird. I guess it's because, I'm engaged! How long before it starts getting annoying?
No, no, not a party. Just a surprise gathering of some people Rachel knows. Um, this is Phoebe and Chandler and Joey.
Oh man, they think they are so slick messing with us! But see they don't know that we know that they know! So...
Dad, dad this is a good thing for me. Ya know, and you even said yourself, you've never seen Richard happier.
All right, I'm gonna go steam my wedding dress okay? Who wants the responsibility of making sure nothing happens to it?
Come on, get into bed! I want to prove to you that I'm not sick! I wanna make you feel, as good as I feel.
Is there any chance that you can look at this as flattering? I mean, she's doing it because she wants to be more like you.
I need a few more things to make the margaritas. Uhh, I need some salt, some margarita mix, and tequila.
It's 2101 and I am not amused. . Ok, the bride and groom have a few words they'd like to say.
Listen, um honey, I appreciate this but you don't have to keep hanging out with them for me, I mean, they have each other.
Umm, I think I spoke too quickly. There-there's a learning curve with this job and maybe we can try it again.
Well. Sounds like you're writing yourself a little play there Rach. Wow! Let me know how that one turns out.
And Nancy said that it's really under price, because the guy lost his job and has to move in with his parents!
Good! Now, take those salads to table 4, And you! Get the swordfish! And you! Get a haircut!
That's right. You're making a commitment and that's the same, whether you do that at the Plaza or, where are you gonna do it?
Are you crazy?! We own those two! I mean look at 'um, he can't breath and she's popping pills.
I don't know, I've never had to use the other one. I'm just saying y'know, if we're having sex, he's not gonna be talking.
I'm making a list of all the things that are most likely to go wrong at the wedding. Now, that way I can be prepared.
No way, with one pound to go, c'mon. We're workin', we're movin', we're in the zone we're groovin'.
You're right, you're right I shouldn't freak out. 'Cause this is what will happen when you and I have babies! When will that be?!
Oh my god, where's my purse? No, you know what? I can replace everything in there. Get that binder, and let's go!
It's easy! Just keep it casual! Give him a kind word, shake his hand and give him the money!
It's not a date, okay. I'm just gonna teach him how to make lasagne for some pot luck dinner he has.
I've not seen her since high school graduation. Oh my God, that night she got so dru. . . motional.
Y'know what? Y'know when I said that I want you to deal with this relationship stuff all on your own? Well, you're not ready for that.
Okay, the realtor said another couple made an offer. Maybe the Janice's won't get it! Maybe the other couple will.
Oh no-no-no, not Dr. Burke. Dr. Burke is out of town. The-the on-call doctor will see me now.
: what means if he gets like a disease or kills someone. not if he gets his jollys to jaws!
Well, you just-you put a quarter in and y'know pull-pull some handles and win like a candy bar or something.
Here, let me show you. Okay, the towels are hanging next to the sink, and umm, you can use the fancy soap.
Listen, I'm sure that dad doesn't care. He probably thought this was funny; he'll be telling this story for years!
You call eight hours alone with my label maker wasted time? Ooh, now I get to use my shredder!
Look Rach, we have to move. I mean if they had lost, we would've made them get rid of the birds. Right?
Honey, that's okay. I actually know this woman, Nancy, who's a restaurant biz head-hunter. Maybe she'll know of something.
Ok, right about now the turkey should be crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside. Why are we standing here?
I gotta go water Pete's plants. Y'know what, if he's gonna break up with me, maybe I won't water his plants.
Is that why he's acting so weird...? He's jealous...? Oh my God, that is crazy. It's not like I'm attracted to Geoffrey...
Look, maybe this is none of my business, or maybe it is, I don't know... but, uh, I'm kind of worried about you.
Oh, no. He doesn't have time for that. But if you want, you can go help him and Joey pack up the guest room.
Well, the end table is wrong, The couch looks bizarre and don't even get me started on the refrigerator magnets.
That's right. That is right, you go over there and tell her you don't want her to live with you. Do not take no for an answer!
Oh my God! It's true!! Oh my God you are so amazing! Oh my God, can I just ask you to do me oh, just one favor?
All right Rachel, you sweep behind, I'll pitch it to you, you throw it down field to Phoebe. All right. Break.
I'm-I'm sorry, it's just that umm... Well I-I cook at this restaurant, Alessandro's, and umm I just got a really bad review...
Soon! I-I just couldn't before. You saw how upset Joey got! I couldn't do that to her, she's my best friend!
No! No-no! I love it! It is a great present! In fact, why don't you go home and wait for the thank you card?
Because I don't have the money or the equipment to handle something that big on such short notice. I mean there's no way.
Well umm, we were just talking about the y'know, the Swing Kings and just wondering whether y'know, they were the right way to go.
Well no wait a minute that's not true! No, what did, that was really sweet. And it kinda works out for the best.
I have like five times, but the guy is so charming, that I go up there to yell and then I end up apologizing to him.
No no no, if I couldn't pay you back right away then I'd feel guilty and tense every time I saw you.
It's so weird, how did Joey end up kissing Charlie last night? I thought you'd end up kissing Charlie.
You are! Hey, here's twenty bucks. -- Why don't you go buy yourself something pretty while I'm at work tomorrow?
He used to lock himself in the basement for hours. No one was every allowed to hear, "The Sound."
Good? Didn't you hear them...I was great! Thank you so much for making me do this. That's is the best gift ever.
Honey, we were at this beautiful place, and I-I-I just put our names down for fun! I mean, what's the harm in that?
Well, CHP because I used to have a crush on Eric Estrada. And ZXY becuase I think it sounds zexy.
I had to go all the way to the basement because some idiot keeps stuffing the trash chute with pizza boxes!
Chandler! It happens to lots of guys! You-you-you were probably tired, you had a lot of champagne, don't worry about it!
Okay. So you, me and London. Looking at people differently. Maybe he wants to do what you and I did in London with someone.
No, last time you said it like Dracula, and it scared her! Can I get you anything? You want some more ice chips?
Yes. Uh, yes, I did. That was my friend, Eddie Moskowitz. Yeah, he likes it. Reaffirms his faith.
Well I-I talked to and uh, she's definitely going to have this baby. Y'know, she said she was gonna raise it on her own.
All right, come on guys, let's go! Tie score, and we're runnin' out of time. Forty-two!! Thirty-eight!! Hike!
Well it wasn't that many guys. I mean, if you consider how many guys there actually are, it's a very small percentage.
Well, I'm never gonna listen to you again, that's for sure! "Y'know, harm can it do if you go and put your name down?"
And the musicians, look, they can go over here , okay? And the chairs can face this way , and... You go.
Oh, I haven't had that feeling since I first started going out with Chandler. Wow, I'm never gonna have that feeling again am I?
Well, I said 'no' to her coming over now! I couldn't say 'no' twice! I get this uncontrollable need to please people!
Look, these clowns are trying to take us for a ride and I'm not gonna let 'em! And we're not a couple of suckers!
Honey, uh, this is a picture of the frame guy posing in front of a bright blue screen with a collie.
I can't! I spent so much money on them and I told Chandler that I'd wear them all the time, I just can't give them away!
Yes there is! He's black and white and shaggy and he's sitting next to Rachel and licking Rachel's hand.
Yeah and if I had seven, maybe I would've said something like this, "Wow! My boyfriend's such a wise ass-seven!"
Ugh, I guess it got sent to the billing address as opposed to the shipping address. Uh! What a pickle.
Okay, just so you know, I'm gonna be ovulating from tomorrow until the sixth, so don't touch yourself in the next 48 hours.
Well for your information he happens to be one of the brightest, most sophisticated, sexiest men I've ever been with.
Not that, this, US. Oh my God, Ross, you-re, you're, it's jus-, you-, ever sin- you been here.
Aw, my little nephew. Come here, little one. There's my little baby Ben. Hey, my little boy. Hey, he's not crying.
Aww, sweetie, but it's not like you're not gonna have anything. You're gonna have nieces and nephews, and some ways that's even better.
Come on Rach, when a guy says he's going to call, it doesn't mean he's going to call. Hasn't it ever happened to you?
This isn't mine. Hey, this isn't, this isn't my stuff! Ugh, Ross! These are your boxes! Where are my boxes?
This is not, what I'm wearing. I'm ovulating and Chandler's gonna be home any minute, so I thought we would try before dinner.
Okay. All right, turkey. Eh, that won't work. Cheese? That won't work. Olive loaf? I hope that won't work.
Used to work with her. Used to! I'm a relative and I didn't get invited! A blood relative! Blood!!
Hey, Rach! I made a pile of your stuff over on this side of the room. If you could just......throw your purses at it.
Alright, wait a second, why would Ross tell everyone in your class that you are as... "gay as the day is long"?
Yeah, she hates all mass produced stuff. She thinks her furniture should have a history, a story behind it.
Okay. Mrs. Green! Okay I'm really sorry!! I'm apologizing for the- Okay, I bit my tongue, but I'm still really sorry!
Ours is so much better! This living room is smaller, the dining room looks like a cave! What a hole!
Huuh, alright, Danny Arshak, ninth grade. Oh, c'mon Rach, you know the bottle was totally pointing at me.
Ok, these were unbelievably expensive, and I know he's gonna grow out of them in like, 20 minutes, but I couldn't resist.
All right Rach, for what it's worth, I think that you're doing great. I mean y'know let's face it, no one handles this well.
Ok, so I think I'm just about done here, unless you have any bad stuff hidden somewhere, like... porn or cigarettes?
Don't get too cocky! Remember I won the last one! Oh, by the way, how did that feel, losing to a girl?
What are you being such a weenie for? So he has a Barbi, big deal. You used to dress up like a woman.
Oh, hey handsome! Oh, I'm gonna love you so much that no woman is ever gonna be good enough for you! Oh, we are so lucky!
She has a better chance of sprouting wings and flying up your nose than you do of not making fun of us.
Why?! To celebrate your relationship! To solidify your commitment! To declare your love for one another to the world!
Chandler that's crazy! If you give up every time you'd have a fight with someone you'd never be with anyone longer than-Ohhh!
Mom says it's all of Manhattan, parts of Brooklyn and Queens, and they have no idea when it's coming back on.
So, maybe I am a little high maintenance. And maybe Rachel is a little bit of a pushover. But you know what we decided you are?
No sweetie, you've got to win over the guy that controls C.H.E.E.S.E.! You've got to kiss some serious robot ass!
Oh my god. We're trying to get pregnant so he's probably starting to freak out about the fact that my body is going to change.
Noo!! The point is that is was you that was there that night! It is you that I am marrying! It is you that I feel in love with!
Joey, what's it like on a movie set, huh? Do you have a dressing room? Do you have a chair with your name on it?
Oh, I'll have an espresso. Oh acutally, I'll get it. If I ask you to, you'll probably end up drinking it yourself.
Well... That's not the only time this was an issue. You remember when umm, you spent Thanksgiving with us? You called me fat.
Umm, I'd love too! Ooh, I love macaroni and cheese. I love-I love the way this box feels against my cheek.
I don't need an actual man, just a couple of his best swimmers. And there, there are places you can go to get that stuff.
I cannot believe that I just spent the last two days trying to figure out the recipe and it was in my cupboard the whole time!
We left Joey alone with the food! Yep! Yep, I knew it! There he is... feeding stuffing to a dog!
Dad, please don't pick your teeth out here! Alright, and if you're gonna put your feet up, why don't you sit on the-
I don't know, how about the idiot who thought he could drive from Albany to Canada on a half a tank of gas!
Thats not how you see me, is it? Phoebe while cutting a sweet potatoe in the air: No you're all about the fun.
Umm, excuse me, we switched apartments. You can't eat are food anymore, that-that gravy train had ended.
All right, I've got a whole bunch of uh-uh, stuff in this area, but umm, I'm getting the feeling that you don't want to deliver.
I know, he's too charming, but if you two start going out, then it's just gonna make it so much harder for me to hate him.
No, a doctor of meat. Of course he's a real doctor. And he's handsome, and he's sweet, and know you'd like him.
Okay, look, this is probably for the best, y'know? Independence. Taking control of your life. The whole, 'hat' thing.
Because he's terrible! Okay, he's slow, he burns things, last night he lit my pastry chef on fire!
Oh, well. Now that I'm here I might as well help you with the cleaning and organizing! Just happen to have my label maker!
I just don't think arcade games go in the beautiful guest room. The beautiful guest room is gonna be filled with antiques.
Oh, um, around 8:02. We ah, talked for a little while, and then um, we went out for an innocent burger.
Y'know, no point in dragging it out. Dragging out the long process of you moving out and us not living together anymore.
Listen, uh, you told me something that was really difficult for you. And I, I-I figured if you could be honest, then I can to.
That tape was never meant to be seen by... Joey I would feel more comfortable if I was having this conversation in private.
Okay, I think that's it. The seating chart is done. This is our wedding. They all look like they're having fun don't they?
Hello? Chandler, what's wrong? Oh my God, are you alright? Yeah, I'll be right there. I'm so sorry, but Chandler was in a car accident.
Okay? Over here we have pink suede, which is nice. But umm, if it gets wet then you know it's gonna shrink.
Yeah, once again, I am sorry. Thank you. Bye. I just had to turn down a job catering a funeral for sixty people.
Ahh, Pete, the other day when you said you needed to talk, umm, just so I know, is it good news or bad news.
Okay, Ben, I won't tell your daddy that you had ice cream for dinner, if you don't tell about our little bonking incident.
Joey, you know, maybe your just not used to kissing men, maybe you just tensed up a little, maybe that's what you need to work on.
No, Ross, we do not hate Emily. We-we just, we just think that you're having to sacrifice a whole lot to make her happy.
Sounds smart and healthy to me. So um, just out of curiosity, um, do you currently have any other racquetball buddies?
Ohhh! Let me see! Oh God, I can't believe this! They're an hour late and they're just staying out there, talking!
You know, I know that things could still go wrong but if they don't? If this works out, we're gonna have a baby Chandler, a baby!
Y'know what? I am really tired of your bellyaching! Okay, I-I worked really hard at making this a nice place for us to live!
: Joey I am not going to objectify woman with you but if her face is as nice as her ass woah mamma.
Well he is! Yeah, I mean marriage is all he talks about! My goodness, in fact, I'm the one that's making him wait!
Okay it's time for the toast! Umm now-now, I know that Ross usually gives the toast, but this year I'm going to do it.
This is where I thought the barca lounger could go! You see you could see the TV and it's still walking distance to the kitchen.
Oh I'm working on my toast for the party, or as I like to call it. Sob fest 2002. Hey check this out.
Nononononono. Think who you're dealing with here. I mean, I'm not like you. I-I can't even stand in front of a tap class.
I give good massages! I used to give them to Rachel all the time before she got allergic! And-and-and Chandler loves them! Watch!
He cannot play at our wedding! I mean everyone will leave! I mean come on, that is just noise! It's not even a song!
Okay, if you need the vacuum, it's in my closet on the left-hand side. Ah, the garbage bags are next to the refrigerator...
Naaaa... He still kills me. Last night he had me laughing so hard, I swear... a little pee came out.
Rachel if you, if you want to go out with him, you can. Sound like a big jerk to me but if that's what you want to do...
Mom already called this morning to remind me not to wear my hair up. Did you know my ears are not my best feature?
Look honey, I wanted you to hook up with Ross as much as you did. But he's with her now and you're just gonna have to get over it.
Ohh, of course we are! We left it up to fate. If we were supposed to get married there would be a clear-cut sign.
Oh yeah, I remember mine! Ohh, it was my sixth birthday, my dad took me to the park, I got it, and...it bent.
It's just... It's hard enough not seeing you during the week, but for Christmas... alright, if this is what you have to do, I understand.
Okay, I have to get that. Now when I get back, I want you and your friends to be gone. Thanksgiving is over. The Vein has spoken.
Now everybody knows the basic erogenous zones. You got one, two three, four , five, six, and seven!
Well, I just think the baby would keep falling off the dog. Do you, uh, do you , do you not see kids in our future.
Honey! Do you know that none of that stuff came from me?! I mean I never said I wanted to have babies and get married right now!
Why don't you just weigh out the good stuff about the relationship against the bad stuff. I mean that's what I did when I first weighing stuff.
Hi Amanda! Actually now... it's... is not a good time. Dinner tomorrow night? Ok, Phoebe and I will see you then!
Money is so impersonal. Cookies says someone really cares. . . Alright, we're broke, but cookies do say that.
Yeah, well I don't think it really counts if you have to read them off the back of your hand after you fall asleep on the couch.
I mean I-I thought you were nuts at first, but you-you did it. And now you can just look back at this thing with no regrets.
Ya know, I was thinking. Ya know how we always stay at your apartment? Well, I thought maybe tonight we'd stay at my place.
I'm not really here. Just thought I'd drop these off...on the way.. my way... Do you come here a lot? Without me?
Chandler! Everyone--no one's eating my Tuscan finger food 'cause they're all filling up on Phoebe's snow cones!
How can you smoke in this day of age? Do you not seen that ad with a little kid walks to grandpa, it's chilling.
Okay. Okay, I can't wait! This is going to be the best Valentine's Day ever! I can't believe it! Make the presents! Make the presents!
Is that that couple on the first floor? Because we should get a baby before them. Yeah! That guy tried to sell me drugs.
You may be okay about getting hurt, but I am not okay with being the one who hurts you. That's why I can't take this job.
Honey, you can relax. Last night at work, Geoffrey told this really sexist joke. After that, not so funny anymore.
I am really an idiot. you see, I was filling out my friend's form, and instead of putting her information, I put mine.
Y'know what? He will forgive you. And I like to bring a pad with me when I go answer the phone just in case... Okay...
I'd rather hang out with a sniveling work weasel guy when I can be hanging out with my boyfriend who I actually respect.
I wanna buy 5 shares of SGJ and I wanna buy them now. C'mon time is money my friend. Thank you. Wooo.
Oh, I still can't believe my dad saw us having sex! He didn't make it to one of piano recitals, but this he sees!
Yeah. But a part of me also can't wait 'til it's over. Chandler and I have this pact not to have sex again until the wedding.
Look, there's Chandler. You knew, that stupid friend of Ross'. Said I'm fat. You know I've already lost 4 pounds!
Yeah, and y'know, if you could not mention to them that we live together, that would be great! , I was thinking we would eat around four.
I don't know it! I want to have a kid with you because I think you're going to be an amazing dad... at the fun parts and the hard parts.
Ohh... Oh, that's okay I hate when people come back to complement the chef. Like I have nothing better to do! So what's up?
Aww, the only reason you want to go out with me because my blond wig, and the big boobs, and the fact that I serve you food.
Well, after 15 years of mom and dad keeping it as a shrine to you, it's time the velvet ropes came down.
Guys can fake it? Unbelievable. The one thing that's ours! Besides, why would you fake it when we're trying to have a baby?
I'm gonna miss this hand! Okay I know it's a lot to ask, but oh my God Chandler, this is a once in a lifetime opportunity.
Okay, I got it. Phoebe? All right, you pull. I'm gonna spread the legs as wide as I can. Joey? Now is not the time!
Oh, sure it does! In high school, you weren't jealous at all even though all your girlfriends were cheating on you!
Well, because you signed it baby kangaroo Tribbiani . Hey, why don't you stop worrying about sounding smart and just be yourself!
It's not ok to do it in a doctor's office but it is ok to do it in a parked car behind a Taco Bell?
Oh it's not big, not at all, you know, kinda the same lines as, say, oh I don't know, having a third nipple.
When Mom and Dad drove you to the hospital to get your nose fixed, I swam into the lake and fished it out.
So why-why wasn't Ross's stuff ruined? And if you say the words medical marvel I'm going to Easy Bake your head!
Oh my God, I can't believe what I'm getting ready to say. I wanna have a baby, but I don't wanna have one with someone who doesn't really wanna have one.
Forget the bubblewrap! There isn't time! Rachel starts messing up Amy's hair: Frizzy frizzy frizzy frizzy!!
No! To take more pictures of all of us together. I mean I really think it's the best resolution because everyone will enjoy the pictures.
Chandler, we have talked about this. You are not supposed to give people advice! Now couldn't you just have made some sort of inappropriate joke?
We're moving in a couple of days and we've got a lot of packing to do. It would be great if you guys could pitch in.
Okay, all right, I think you're great, I think you're sweet, and you're smart, and I love you. But you will always be the guy who peed on me.
And when he's naked I can throw him out in the front yard and lock the door and all the neighbors will just humiliate him!
White House adviser? Clinton's campaign guy? The one with the great hair, sexy smile, really cute butt?
Hey! Continuing the countdown of your favorite meals. Tonight, No. 3, macaroni and cheese with cut up hot dogs.
An era is defined as a significant period of time. Now, it was significant to me, maybe it wasn't significant to you!
What if it's new? I mean, we agreed not to talk again, unless we had something really important to say. Shouldn't I call him back?
Yes! Carol and Susan's caterer had a mountain bike accident this weekend, and she's in a full body cast.
And it has to go perfectly, because if she doesn't like something about us she can keep us off every adoption list in the state.
I'm not going to be a part of this! You can't just bring some random guy at home and expect him to be our sperm donor!
I'm fine now, but it was really scary there for a while. I mean, someone slipped a-a threatening note under the door.
I'll be coordinator! Oh my God! I'm so sorry, I didn't get you anything! Okay, look everybody has to help! Okay? You can help, can't you Phoebe?
All right, big brother. Which of these do you think would make your little sister look hotter, so your best friend would want to do her?
Ok, all right. It was an accident, I swear, all right. I was putting on my jacket, and the thing, and the lamp, and it broke.
Okay! It's time for dinner. Everyone we're using our fancy china.. um and its very expensive so please be careful.
The days and nights are hard! I get it! Okay? Look umm, Rachel I'm sorry! I have to start getting ready! I'm getting married today!
Oh, and I can also speak a little French. Voulez-vous coucher avec moi ce soir? Why? What did I say?
All right, so now that Ross knows can you tell us y'know how it happened? I mean, when did it happen? How many times did it happen?
Wait a minute, you stayed home all day and played Ms. Pac-Man while I went off to work like some kind of chump?!
All right, I'm out of oven space. I'm gonna turn on Joey's. Please, watch him! Do not let Joey eat any of the food!
All right, all right. Maybe I can fit them in if I just do some rearranging. But uh, Rachel may actually have to sit at the bar!
No, those first two windows, that's the lobby. And y'know the other one over there, that's the stairway. You've been counting wrong.
Oh wait, you know what, I got it, I got it, pretend like you just woke up, okay, that will throw her off. Be sleepy.
Oh, my mom called, they're gonna run our engagement announcement in the local paper, so we're looking for a good picture of us.
Thanks. Like, check out my new catering stuff. Look at this! I'm an omelet station! Omelet? Made to order!
Hey Rach, what about this? Huh? Who-who gets this? See, I don't know if I want it because it might be y'know, too many memories!
Oh no! I don't know anything about cooking. I had to ask someone what it's called when the, when the water makes those little bubbles.
Sure! If you're just gonna hang out as friends, then maybe I'll join ya. You know, I'm your friend and Mike's friend .
I figured out I need to charge seventeen bucks a jar just to break even. So, I've got a new plan now. Babies.
I know! Now look, there's only one problem though. There's only room for one, so I guess one of you will have to stay at Joey's.
I'm on top of the world, looking down on creation and the only explanation I can find, is the wonders I've found ever since...
But, you see, it's just... this night has to go just perfect, you know? And, well, Wendy's more of a... professional waitress.
Y'know, I think if I were going to be with a woman. It'd, it'd be with someone like Michelle, she was so oh, she was so petite.
Oh...Phoebe? Maybe I wasn't clear before. I really love listening to your music here, but my restaurant is sort of an upscale place.
Oh, and by the way, he's lost a bunch of weight. I mean he looks goo-ood! Okay, I mean really, really gorgeous! I still love Chandler.
Great! Umm, well what-what I was doing in Chandler's room is that umm, I was cleaning it! In fact, he pays me to clean it!
That's what we used to call your ah, your motorcycle in high school. Y'know how a motorcycle is a Chopper, and you're Chip. Nevermind.
It's weird, but you know what I don't wanna throw this away. I mean this is like all I have left of him, gross, drain hair. Ooh!
When we found out that we're gonna get this baby, Chandler and I started talking and we decided that we didn't want to raise a kid in the city.
Ha, ha, very funny, very funny. But I think we'd like to give poker another try. Shall we, ladies?
All right, Chandler can make boxes, Ross can wrap, and Joey can lift things. Now Phoebe, go tell the guys they have to help out!
He didn't die. I saw his daughter last week. Said he was fine. Her on the other hand, botched Botox.
And, well, don't you have a lot of wild oats to sew? Or is that what you're doing with me? Oh my God, am I an oat?
Hey, see that snippy guy over there? He's the one who decides who gets up on the platform. We should go dance by him.
Yeah, well, I'm using noise. Okay. All right! So, is everybody ready? Here we go. I hear something! I hear something! Where is it?
Y'know I used to go out with this guy that was a really light sleeper, and whenever I started to snore, he would just roll me over...
That's a good question. Look umm, last night we let the dice decide. Maybe we should leave it up to fate again. I love you!
Okay, okay, I'm sure that Rachel came home early and picked up Emma. You go look across the hall, and I'll call her cell.
You're just new at this, it'll get better, think about your first day at work. I mean, that couldn't have been easy but you figured that out.
Okay, the reason why I asked you guys out to brunch today is because I have been doing some thinking about who should be my maid of honor.
All right people, we're in trouble here. We've only got 12 hours and 36 minutes left. Move, move, move!
That's good, have a seat. Um, the doctor says it's gotta be a needle. You're just gonna have to be brave, ok? Can you do that for me?
I wish we at least knew his name... Look at that face. I mean, even sleeping, he looks smart. I bet he's a lawyer.
This is great! Now she's gonna be mad at Rachel! Y'know what? And I'm just gonna swoop in there and be like the daughter she never had.
Look at these authentic fake medals. I tell ya, mom's gonna be voted best dressed at the make-believe military academy.
Well, I don't care! That-that turkey has to feed 20 people at my parent's house and they're not gonna eat it off your head!
Great! Well Rachel, the reason why I won't let you drive the Porsche is because you're a terrible driver. There! That wasn't about the wedding.
I know, I know. I'm just so tired of-of missing him. I'm tired of wondering why hasn't he called. Why hasn't he called!
I'll get everybody else , finally we can start celebrating my- I'm sorry, uh apparently I've opened the door to the past.
Yeah, I'm sure your ex-wife will be more than happy to move to another country so you can patch things up with your new wife.
You actually broke her watch? Wow! The worst thing I ever did was, I-I shredded by boyfriend's favorite bath towel.
You would not. I can't believe this. I hate this, you're too normal. I can't believe my boyfriend doesn't have a thing. My boyfriend doesn't have a thing.
I mean I have not been picked on this much since kindergarten and they had to bring in someone from junior high to do the see-saw with me.
Yes! Absolutely. Okay? Look, you'll know it's mine because on the right cup, the lacey part, there's a very noticeable rip.
Come on! Come on, if we have sex again it'll double our chances of getting pregnant. Do you think that closet's still available?
Okay, we've been out here for two hours and we haven't seen any stupid comets. Can we go now? I mean, Chandler's getting chilly.
Is it me? Is it like I have some sort of beacon that only dogs and men with severe emotional problems can hear?
And Ross, if it weren't for Rachel's rumor I mean no one in high school would even know who you were. She put you on the map!
That's because their nerves are probably deadened from being so stupid. But hey, y'know if you don't believe me, please, by my guest.
Alright, let me ask you this question: How many of you thought the music was fine, but not in keeping with the tone of the restaurant? .
Why don't you phase it out? Yeah, fade the accent out and people will think you're, y'know, that you're adjusting to life in America.
Joey they're not real. I start miles beneath the surface of these things, ok, they're fake. See honk honk.
Oh my god. Today's the sixth?! I may be done ovulating! I may have also served some very questionable meat at the restaurant.
A jazz trio for cocktails. The Bay City Rollers for dancing. Wait, that was from my sixth grade wedding.
Okay, everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor. This is everybody, this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my brother Ross?
No! No you should! A lot of major actors do nude scenes! I mean the chance to star in a movie? Come on!
Or, it could mean that-that you saw Chandler and me together and we y'know were being close and stuff and then you just want to have that with someone too.
I don't know. Look he's a great guy and I love being with him but... you know. Things happen, and they happen. You don't plan these things.
I mean, who knows how long it's gonna take for someone else to give us a baby? What if, what if no one ever picks us?
Oh good you're all here. Thanksgiving tomorrow, four o'clock. Oh, guess who I invited. Remember that guy Will Colbert from high school?
Noo!! It's driving me crazy. I mean every other way he's like the perfect guy, he has everything. Plus! He actually has everything.
Oh God! Orange juice just came out of my nose, but it was totally worth it. Oh my God, I completely forgot about your sound.
Well, um, look I-I don't want this to come our wrong, but ah, you seem awfully confident for a guy I just told I wasn't attracted too.
Yeah. Anyway, he told me about your apartment. And, um, I couldn't sleep, thinking about it. So, uh, would it be okay if I cleaned it?
I'm making cookies for Erica. And oh, by the way, we have to leave for the airport soon, her plane comes in about an hour.
Well, she actually has a boyfriend y'know herself, named Clark. Uh, she also kinda invited herself to our wedding. Clark too.
Oh yeah! I saw her walkin' it down the street the other day. She had uh, these flowers in the basket. It was so cute.
I'm his sister, okay? I love him! I don't want to see him get hurt! Come on! Doesn't that give me the right to control him-help him?
Alright here's something, it says to try holding the baby close to your body and then swing her rapidly from side to side.
Sit down. All right? Please, just listen to me. You are terrible at this! Okay? You are the worst ultimate fighter ever! Ever!!
Terrible. If-if I want something done right, I have to do it myself. Other people just wreck stuff. I really think I might kill someone tonight.
If we wanna get on camera, I think we have to get up on one of those platforms. They've been taping those people up there all day.
Well I'm not sure yet, but umm of the top of my head I'm thinking double sided tape and some sort of luncheon meat.
Hey. It's three in the morning. They don't know that I've come home yet. You notice how neither one of them are wondering where I am.
Uh-huh, but I'm sure you can handle this. I mean, I have won awards for my organizational skills, but, uh, I'm sure you'll do fine.
Okay, just to be clear comedy with the plates will not be well recieved. Ross makes some sort of sound to let us know it hurt.
So what, he's a little older, big deal, I mean he's important to me. Ya know if you ask him, he might take you on his Jag.
Of course I wouldn't approve, I mean, you were totally in love with this guy who, hello, was gay. I mean, what the hell were you thinking?
Really? But tomorrow night is the only night I get off from the restaurant. If you go to the game, we won't have a night together for another week.
Are you kidding?! I practically spent my entire childhood at the arcade! This is like-Oh my, this is like my second favorite game!
I'm getting married today!!! I think I just cracked a rib. But I don't care because today's my wedding day! My day is finally here!!
No!! Why didn't you make a copy and-and keep it in a fireproof box and keep it at least a hundred yards from the original?!!
Okay! The movers will be here in 11 hours. Rachel has not packed. Now, everybody has to help! Chandler, we're gonna start with...
"Tonight's the night we're gonna make it happen, tonight we'll put all other things aside. Give in thistime and show me some affection..."
Really Phoebs? Because, you know, you'd have to be an actual waitress. This can't be like your 'I can be a bear cub' thing.
Groomsman, groomsman, why are you just standing there, where is your bridesmaid? We've got a broken arrow. Bridesmaid down! Oh, that's me.
Here. Ben, do you wanna play the airplane game, do you wanna show Rachel? Come here. We're gonna do something fun. Okay. Weee!! Weee!!
That is a wonder. So tell me something, Mom. If you had to do it all over again, I mean, if she was here right now, would you tell her?
Oh my God! You are gonna love me so much! I felt really bad about the whole bachelorette party thing, so tonight you're gonna have a bachelor party.
Oh look, the pool table's free. Rack 'em up. I'll be back in just a minute. Get ready for me to whip your butt.
Fine! Don't be my friends! I'll buy new friends! Yeah, and then I'll pay for their plastic surgery so they'd look just like you!
Ohh, she's looking down the hall. Oh! She looked right at me! Oh wait, you can't see people through that little hole, can you? Hello!
Oh, it's a great party! Great food. Y'know, most parties it's all chips and salsa, chips and salsa. So umm, what's this?
Ohh! Umm, Phoebe, I kinda need to talk to you about that. Umm, well I-I-I think it might be time for me to take a step back from catering.
Oh, yeah, right! And after I took a shower this morning I just threw my towel on the floor! Oh God, it hurts to even joke about it.
Well then, y'know what? I care about you to much to watch you hurt yourself like this. So if you have to do this, then you're gonna have to do it without me.
Oh yeah, she didn't hire me out of pity, it wasn't so she could pick on me in front of her friends, she actually thinks I'm good.
I'm sorry, they just, they just look so good! And the saleswoman was looking at me like, "Oh, these are way too expensive for you."
This is Rachel. I mean, what are you gonna do, never going to talk to her again? I mean I know it's weird, it's awkward, but you gotta at least try.
It's so sweet. It really is. It has this big yard that leads down to this stream and then there's these old maple trees...
Hey guys! You found the presents? Chandler, you let them find the presents? Great! Do you know how long it took me to find you that water purifier?
Okay, fine. Let's talk about snow. -- Do you think it's snowing in Tulsa, where my husband is having sex on a copying machine?
Oh no no, this is not for him, this is for me. That way he's still sober but I find his stories about shoelaces much more amusing.
Well umm, they both have a egg yolk and butter base, but a bearnaise has shallots, shirvel, and most importantly tarragon.
It's gotta be one of a kind. Y'know like umm, y'know uh, what's that God awful ceramic fruit bowl she has on her counter?
The second that Ross walks in that door, I want you take him back to your bedroom and do whatever it is that you do that makes him go, rweee!!
No! Y'know, the fantasy! Meet someone from a strange land, fall in madly love, and spend the rest of your lives together.
Ok, so that's what we're doing. You know, when I'm in the coffee house bopping along to one of your songs, I'm wearing ear plugs.
Well, he did this bit... You probably had to be there, but it was Liza Minelli locked in our freezer, eating a raw chicken.
YOU BET YOUR ASS I AM! I just had the best first day ever! The kitchen: twice as big as Allessandro's.
C'mon Chandler, I think we have been given an opportunity. I mean, the mistake has already been made. They are writing up the paper right now.
Of course it was! Trust me, when it comes to psychology I know what I'm talking about. I took two psych classes in college.
Oh, Rach! Rach! Umm hey, could you do me a favor and would talk to Chandler's dad and try to keep him away from Chandler's mom?
All right then, go fight for her! Go to London! I mean, that could be you and Emily! That, but-but nicer. Just, go to London!
You know everything!! Oh wait, double or nothing. I bet you the baby is over seven pounds. I bet you it has hair. I bet you it's a girl.
I thought I was making headway, everyone was smiling at me all day, I get off work and I find out that they wrote this on my chef's hat.
Well, so far I have uh, my bride's maids dresses won't get picked up, my veil gets lost, or I don't have my something blue.
So wait, Ross's stuff is fine, but I have no memories because you wanted to keep the bottom two inches of your car away from water!!!
Okay! Very funny! Somebody let me out please?! Come on, I'm cold! And covered in marinara sauce! Come on! Let me out!
Wait a minute, just because he paid for your head shots you're gonna take him? Joey, I don't think you're comprehending just how slutty this dress is!
That is completely untrue. You think I'm high maintenance? Okay, prove it. I want you to make a list and we're going to go through it point by point!
We're Aunt Monica and uncle Chandler, by the way. You may not recognize us, because we haven't spoken to your parents in seventeen years!
Hey, isn't weird to think about how next year at this time they'll be a little baby at the table? Rachel's! But good to know where you're at!
Oh, well... um, that's all there are of these. But in about eight and a half minutes, we'll be serving some delicious onion tartlets.
Hello? Oh, Hi, Ju Hi, Jew! Uh huh? Uh huh? Ok. Um, sure, that'd be great. See ya then. Bye.
Uh, look, Larry honey, umm, I wrote the book on Section 5 and I know that you don't have to wear your hat unless you're in the kitchen.
Myself. Y'know for remembering to pack a thing. Yeah, you do a good thing, you get a check! My mom does it, I never realised it was weird.
This baby has got everything. Take y'know, locations for instance. First, organized alphabetically, then geographically, then by square footage.
Oh, please, stop! Look, we're supposed to be honest with each other. I-I just wish you could tell me-just say, "I don't like your massages."
If you have the big apartment you have to deal with people coming over all the time. That fridge has got to be stocked, okay, that's your department now.
It's not like I want to get married tomorrow! It's just that I-I'd like to believe that I'm in a relationship that's actually going somewhere, that I'm not just wasting my time!
Well, we're trying to find someone to perform our wedding and they're all either boring or annoying or y'know, can't stop staring at the ladies.
Let me think. Oh, when I was younger I used to dream that I got married to Mayor McCheese, and on our wedding night I ate his head.
Yes! Every year Ross makes the toast, and it's always really moving, and always makes them cry. Well this year I'm going to make them cry.
It's worse. The only thing that's getting me through is knowing that I'm gonna be seeing you soon. I think I may even try to get out of here early.
Well now, I get to spend my shower with the only people I really love! I mean, I get all those presents without having to talk to people I don't even like!
Nooo! Never! I mean, we're living in the moment. God, it is so nice for once to not have to get all hung up on 'Where is this going?'
Hey, the point is that he was at everyone of your swim meets and he was there cheering you on! Okay? That's a, that's a pretty great dad.
Yeah. In fact, I like her so much you tell her I want my cookies early this year! Y'know, a box of Thin Mints and some Tag-a-Longs.
When two people finally realise their feelings for each other, and-and they talk for hours, and they-they learn all about the other person!
De-caff. Okay, everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor. This is everybody, this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my brother Ross?
Oh, what a great argument, exhaling! All right, y'know what, I'll prove it to you, okay. I'll trade you Joey for Rachel, and I'll still win the game.
Um, yeah, so uh, uhh, listen, I'm sorry I didn't tell you this before but umm, I, I'm no longer at my job, I, I had to leave it.
Well, you're... you're different funny... I mean, you're... you're more sarcastic a-a-and... well, he does... bits... and impressions... and... and limericks...
All right, Rachel's party is in a couple of hours and there's a lot to do. Now, Ross, you got Geller blood, you're in charge of these yahoos!
Well, you guys have been friends forever. Remember the first time that you kissed Ross? How weird that was? You couldn't stop laughing? You got through that.
Umm, actually I was about to tell you that I was, I was going to get out of it, but hey, if we're just goofing around then uh, maybe I will go out with him.
Oh umm, that's because I just wanted to y'know walk in on me and Chandler while we were, y'know, doing it all night. Will you excuse me for just a second?
Could you please tell me what this is in reference to? Yes, hold on. Um, they say there's been some unusual activity on your account.
You would not believe my day! I had to work two shifts, and then to top it off, I lost one of my fake boobs, in a grill fire.
All right, eight we get married, but 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12 we don't get married.
Wait a minute! Unless, we give her all gifts she can use after she's done being pregnant. Like-like umm, regular coffee, Tequila.
Y'know what, I've got to walk out of here right now, 'cause getting over you is the hardest thing that I have ever had to do. I don't think I could do it again.
I think it's totally insane, I mean, they work for the hospital. It's like returning to the scene of the crime. You know, I say we blow off the dates.
Fine! If you want me to wear the boots, I'll wear the boots. In fact, I'll go into my room right now and y'know try the outfit on.
I know! It's just that...ever since high school Rachel was the one person I told everything too. Y'know? I miss that so much now. She's my best friend.
Man, this sucks! Y'know if Mom and Dad don't see us on TV after we made them so jealous, I mean, who's gonna be the losers then?
Why did I 'woo-hoo'? I mean, what was I hoping would happen? That-that he'd turn round and say 'I love that sound, I must have you now'?
Look. I'm sure there's some friendly way to reconcile this! Um, have a seat. First of all, we haven't been introduced, I'm Monica Geller.
What don't you just calm down Phoebe! All right?! Why don't you just get all your facts before you run around telling everybody that you're the only hot couple!!
Well, my breasts are going to get bigger weather you like it or not! And you know what? It's not just my breasts. My ass is going to get bigger too.
Okay. Oh but Joey, come over later because I'm going to teach you to make a bird feeder out of just a pine cone and some peanut butter.
Exactly. Oh, I love that I can be totally neurotic around you now. Tell me the truth. Don't you like it better now that everything on your desk is perpendicular?
Listen umm, I've been thinking, it's not fair for me to ask you to spend all of your money on our wedding. I mean, you work, you work really hard for that.
Oh, what'd ya bring me?! Awww, hotel toiletries from Japan. Oh, these are gonna go in my permanent collection. You want some coffee?
No I totally disagree. No I think it's fine for a guy to do something like that. Such you an actor. Not that you need to,your eyebrows are...
Yeah! You already got the first class tickets; you got the lounge! I mean we should get free stuff too! I mean you're not the only ones on your honeymoon!
Did you hear that?! They bumped them up to first class because they are on their honeymoon! Come on! Let's act like we're on our honeymoon.
Okay, I gotta go find Rachel but umm, if you guys see her could you please try to give her some really bad news so that mine doesn't seem so bad?
Hello? Oh, hi Wendy! Yeah, eight o'clock. What did we say? Ten dollars an hour?... OK, great. All right, I'll see you then. Bye.
Ohh, I'm so glad. Thank you so much for staying so calm during this. I mean it's really, it's made me stay calm. I coulda been worse!
Y'know what? After you're with this woman for like ten minutes, you forget all that. I mean, she is this astounding person, with this, with this amazing spirit.
All right uh, the important thing is to take your time, you want to hit 'em all, and you mix 'em up. You gotta keep them on their toes.
This wasn't addressed to Days of Our Lives, this is, this came to your apartment. There's no stamp on it, this woman was in our building.
It's so good, that I feel really selfish about being the only one who's eating it, that I think we should have everyone taste how good it is. Especially Ross.
Okay. No need to panic. Deep breathes everyone. Okay umm uh, we're just gonna have to spend some time and put the CDs in the right cases.
See Chandler? I'm getting a lot of use out of them already! They're very practical. See, you can wear them with dresses, with skirts, with pants...
Okay so this is where the band is. And this is where the bar is. And all these pins have people's names on them. And Rach, here you are.
Ya know, my party is fun. I mean, maybe it's a little quieter, less obvious sorta fun but, you know, if people would just give it a chance...
Well you know it's just like living with a girl. Only they don't steal your makeup. Unless they're playing "This is what my sister would look like"
Because I know that you think the lottery is "boohaki" but we're all here and gonna watch the numbers and have fun. And you're my brother, and I want you to be a part of this.
Okay, here's batch 22. Ohh, maybe these'll taste a little like your grandmother's. This has a little bit of orange peel, but no nutmeg.
They want me to do it, which is really cool, seeing as I've never catered before, and I really need the money, and this isn't a problem for you, is it?
Oh, friends first, drunk in London, you know the story. I've got a better question for you: Do you or any of your blood relatives have diabetes?
Ok. Hold on. Geller here! No! I said it has to be there by 4 o'clock. Goodbye. Oh, how hard it is to make an ice sculpture?
OH GOD NO! Nope, no, no, no. No! No, no. Nope! No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. NO! No!
All right, we still have a minute and a half to go, and we're down by two points. Two points.... Phoebe you do a button-hook again. Rachel, you go long.
The woman from the museum called and said that there was a cancellation and that we could move up our wedding and Chandler heard! I know! How bad is this?!
What?! Are you crazy? You just had Ross's baby! It's-it's so inappropriate. No, it's worse than that. It's wrong. It's... It is bigger than mine!
Yeah Joey she's...Rachel's got this really big work problem, and it is a head scratcher. Wow! Y'know what, if we're gonna make dinner we're gonna have to leave. Yeah.
That was that girl Megan! She booked the Swing Kings on the day of our wedding and said that I couldn't have them back unless I gave her the dress!
Why? It's just that I've waited seven years for an opportunity like this, and you can't even wait four and a half minutes for a stupid onion tartlet?
Wow, that's a big cable bill! Huh, you don't have a job, but you have no problem ordering porn... on a Saturday afternoon?! I was in the house!
You can't say that!! You-you don't know!! I mean I thought I was gonna pass out from the pain! Anyway I-I tried, but I-I couldn't...bend that way. So...
Okay, the owner of Allesandro's came over to yell at me, but instead I made him some sauce, and he offered me the job as head chef!!
Sure. Oh, um, Chandler? Y'know, the-the old Monica would-would remind you to scrub that Teflon pan with a plastic brush...But I'm not gonna do that.
Whoa-whoa-whoa, Phoebe you gotta take her! Y'know I-I-I said some really bad stuff about her, but y'know Rachel has some good qualities that make her a good roommate.
No no, the father can, but um, since I am the roommate I can tell you that she's not here and I'll pass along the message, ok. So bye-bye.
Okay, forget the specials for a minute. Umm, all right here's the thing, for the last two weeks I have umm, tried really hard to create a positive atmosphere...
Phoebe, it's okay. You don't have to tip toe around me. I-I've been thinking about it and umm, y'know what? I'm okay about not having that new relationship feeling...
Yes. I hated you. I mean I, I, loved you in a 'you're my brother so I have to' kind of way, but basically, yeah, I hated your guts.
So, I'll get candles and my mom's lace tablecloth, and since it's Rachel's birthday, I mean, we want it to be special, I thought I'd poach a salmon.
Okay, guys, listen, don't forget that tomorrow is the day that Emily gets married again, so whatever we do, just try to really keep Ross's mind off of it.
No. I don't think that you and I were destined to end up together. I think that we fell in love and work hard at our relationship. Some days we work really hard.
Yeah, I got this number from this guy at work and I hired a stripper to come dance for you. Am I going in the wife hall of fame or what?!
We're waiting for the adoption lady, but, hey, I'm glad you're here. I was cleaning this morning and I found this . I don't know if you wanna use it, but...
Oh, about five minutes. Right now they're interviewing his opponent. Apparently he trains by going to Iran and pulling the arms off thieves.
I've got a plan. I've got a plan. I'm going to ram this platter really hard into your ribs. You're gonna scream out and that'll wake her up!
Oh my God! You cleaned! Look at these floors! You did the windows! Oh, I have been begging you for months and you did! You cleaned! And nagging works!
Chandler is supposed to find out if he's getting an assistent job at his ad agency. But out of the 15 interns, they are only hiring three.
Be that as it may, d'you think you could just help us out here on that monkey thing? Y'know, just for old times' sake? Go Bobcats?
Are you kidding? This is where they get out stains! Okay? This is like Disneyland for me. I'm-I'm gonna be over here watching the dance of the clean shirts.
Okay. It's-it's about Alan. There's something that you should know. I mean, there's really no easy way to say this.. uh.. I've decided to break up with Alan.
Well, if you're gonna be totally rational about this, I can't argue with you! All right? Fine, if you wanna tell him, tell him. I just don't want to be a part of it.
I can't wait to be with you! I'll sneak over as soon as Ross picks up Ben. I'll just tell Rachel I'm gonna be doing laundry for a couple of hours.
Y'know, all these years, I thought you were on my side. But maybe what you were doing was sucking up to Mom and Dad so they'd keep liking you better!
Ok, how about this: We got wind up toys for Emma for her birthday. We can make them race, and whoever comes in last, stays!
You're the most wonderful man. And if you hadn't of said 'if I have to' like seventeen times, then I'd be saying 'okay, let's do it.'
I-I'm not gonna be able to make it into work today, I don't feel very good. Yes!! Wow! Uh, for a second there I thought I was really better, but I'm not.
Hey, have you guys eaten, because uh, Richard and I just finished and we've got leftovers... Chicken and potatoes... What am I wearing?...Actually, nothing but rubber gloves.
Lewis Posin! He was my best friend in fifth grade, and-and then one day I asked him to be my boyfriend and he said no. Do you know why?
I know...God. I haven't seen my savings take a hit like this since I was a kid and they came up with double-stuffed Oreos. What happened to all our money?
Ok, for my next song I think I'll sing something a little more upbeat. All right? Oh, how about the PointerSisters "I am so excited". And make it bouncy!
Oh, But you're finally doing something that you love! I can't ask you to give that up. Though it'd be nice if the thing that you love was y'know... finding gold.
Okay Ben, why don't you come open some more presents, and Santa, the Armadillo, and I have a little talk in the kitchen? There's a sentence, I never thought I'd say.
Chandler... In all my life... I never thought I would be so lucky. As to...fall in love with my best...my best... There's a reason why girls don't do this!
Hey, Joey, I don't think that you should leave Chandler alone. I mean it's only been two days since he broke up with Kathy. Maybe you can go fishing next week?
Wait a minute, Phoebe! We should be partners. We should be catering partners. I mean, think about it! You're not working right now, and we have such a great time together!
All right, let's be practical, if Ross isn't willing to do it, he's not the only guy in the world you can have sex with. You can borrow Chandler-Chandler is good!
Actually there is. Chandler usually helps me with this, but he's really into the game so I don't want to bother him. Could you help me fold these napkins?
If you would stop thinking about Ross for one minute you would notice that there are great guys everywhere! I mean, look! Look, Gunther! I mean, he's nice, he's cute.
Are you trying to tell me that we're moving to Oklahoma, or that you're gay? All right, not that this matters, but did they at least offer you a huge raise?
OK, look. That is Aunt Iris. This woman has been playing poker since she was five. You gotta listen to every word she says. Hi!
You invite my brother, you invite my whole family, and not me?! Why?! What-Why wouldn't you want me at your wedding? What could I have possibly done?! Stuart!
But I'm gonna be there... for the rest of my life. I mean, I can't break up with him. I'm the one who made him quit drinking. He's dull because of me.
Listen uh, I-I've been doing some thinking, and I don't know whether it's because we're here or Rachel's giving birth but umm, I think we should try to have a baby.
Anyway, Ross and I were always captains, and um, it got kind've competitive and one year, Geller Bowl VI, I accidentally broke Ross's nose.
But I need it. Otherwords I'm gonna have to take that horrible diner job. You know, with the dancing and the costumes. I don't wanna have to wear flame retardant boobs.
Okay, I got that. I'll escape over there. I'll come back over here. All right, come on Ms. Pac-Man. It's got-Right- Well, you're just a little bitch, aren't you?
Hi, Dad. No, no, it's me. li-listen, Dad, I can't talk right now, um, but there's something, um... there's something that I've been meaning to tell you...
I mean they're trying to do everything they can to make me quit, and if there were any other job, I would. But this is something I've been waiting for my whole life.
: Oh well this is the only one they had at our video store, but they did have something called crocodile killers. Or does it always have to be sharks?
Oh well umm, I make it myself! It's two parts ammonia and one part lemon juice. And now the secret ingredient is...y'know what? We just met.
Ok, Mike, enough is enough, now you love Phoebe and she loves you, so you need to get over your whole "I never want to get married" thing and step up!
Oh, why does this bother me so much? I mean I don't wanna be one of those people who tells their boyfriend they wanna spend 24 hours a day with them.
No. No. Not it. Not it. Not it. Don't crowd me! This is it! This is the dress! Oh my God, it's perfect! I'm sorry, this one's taken! Whoa!
Ah, well if you don't clear this off, you won't be getting one of those from me. But Ben's coming over here tomorrow to play this game, this can't be there.
Okay Ben, why don't you come open some more presents, and Santa, the Armadillo and I have a little talk in the kitchen? There's a sentence I'd never thought I'd say.
Man, I would be great in a war! I mean, I really, I think I would make a fantastic military leader. I mean I know I would make General way before any of you guys.
Chandler, here you go, got your traditional Thanksgiving feast, you got your tomato soup, your grilled cheese fixin's, and your family size bag of Funyuns.
Oh, you know, my flock is good, I mean, yeah, my flock pretty much takes care of themselves at this point. Good flock. Flock, flock, flock.
Chandler, you're not fourteen anymore. Okay? Maybe it's time that you let that stuff go. If your father's not at your wedding...you're gonna regret it for the rest of your life.
Hmm, no. I mean how can I accept a restaurant from him? I-I-I-I can't. I couldn't even accept a necklace from Stu Vincent in the seventh grade.
All right then, then nothing changes! Everything is great! Everything stays the same! And you go unpack because it's been three days and it's driving me insane!
Yes! Yes! And I think that the first gift that Rachel opens should be from the grandmother of the baby, because you're the most important person in this room. And in the world!
Oh my God, the cat's made my eyes water! Don't-don't throw it to me! My vision's been compromised!! Oh God! Okay. Okay. It's okay. Man, that was close.
Please... honey, leave the details to me. Now I wanna make this day as special for you as I can. Now, ok, I was thinking that the harpist should wear white.
Okay, sperm donor number 03815, come on down! Okay, he's 6'2", 170 pounds, and he describes himself as a male Geena Davis.
Well, instead of being sad that tonight is my last night together with Rachel we thought we'd go out to dinner and celebrate the fact that Rachel is moving in with Phoebe.
Whew. Although y'know, this is part of a salt and pepper set. I mean... I guess y'know it may just count as a half a present. What do you think?
Who? I mean have you seen a car come by here in the last hour and a half? I think we should call Ross, maybe he can get a car and come pick us up.
Oh my God. Phoebe. Don't look now, but behind us is a guy who has the potential to break our hearts and plunge us into a pit of depression.
I actually know someone in advertising. I grew up with this guy who is a vice president at a big agency. Maybe I can get him to meet you? Give me the phone.
That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong. Y'see, he's the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born.
Ok people, we are back in business! Oh God, we've missed you soo much! Ok, go and get your hair and make-up done, and I'll take care of everything.
No, no, no, I don't make chocolate pies. When I was younger I-I enter in this pie-eating contest. I ate so many that just the thought of them made me sick.
Any time you want. Y'know, when I was younger, all I wanted to do was to play with this dollhouse, but no!! It was to be looked at, but never played with.
You say 'Thank you very much,' and then you buy me something pretty. Come on, we're gonna put are hands in this bowl, and we're gonna start squishing the tomatoes.
Umm, I just wanna say, uh that with a pinch of exictement, a dash of hard work, a dollup of cooperation, we can have the recipe... Are you gonna kill me?
Honey I can't even imagine how hard this must be for you. But, I don't want you to lose Joey over it. And right now he just needs to know that you're still his friend.
I just can't believe you're in here. I mean, what am I gonna do without you? Who's gonna crash the embassy parties with me? Who's gonna take me to the Big Apple Circus?
Ross, Rachel promised it would be over by now. We seriously have to go, if we want to get to Vermont. I called them and the last train leaves in a half hour.
You know what? I take back what I said before. You keep playing at the restaurant, because with your music driving people inside, my bar sales are going up like crazy.
Oh good. Good, look I'm so sorry, for screwing up that cutting-her-out plan. But I have a new plan. Chandler agreed to call here in a few minutes with an emergency.
Ok, so there's not a magazine under the couch, or a pack of cigarettes taped to the back of the toilet tank, or a filthy video in the VCR?
: he has to work, there's some rush on the big ah damn it one of these days I'm really gonna have to start listening when he talks about his job.
Just going over my toast. Those two will never know what hit 'em. I can't wait. They're going to be crying so hard. They're going to be fighting for breath.
Oh my God, it's gonna WORK! We're gonna make it work! I'm gonna be a mummy and you're gonna be a daddy! All right, I'll see you suckers. I'm gonna get me... A BABY!
I know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish, but, were you planning on bringing up the whole baby/lesbian thing? Because I think it might take some of the heat off me.
You know, Rachel, when you ran out of your wedding, I was there for you. I put a roof over your head, and if that means nothing to you... twenty dollars an hour.
For this weekend! Oh gosh, it would be perfect, we get to see Joey plus we get to start our anniversary celebration on the plane. We can call it out plane-aversary.
How dirty do you think I am? I'm telling you, if you had some candles and some bubbles and some music, you would love it! It would take all of your stress away.
Well, of course I do. What's not to like! I'll take her in a minute! But, you know, I think that you're giving up too easy, honey. I think that you need to fight for her!
So, I went down to the post office, and it turns out it was those videos that I ordered for Richard about the Civil War. He loved the Civil War.
Lips moving, still talking. I mean it may not be ideal, but I'm so ready. No, I-I-I see the way Ben looks at you. It makes me ache, you know?
So, I read this article in the paper the other day that says you're not supposed to throw rice at weddings, because when pigeons eat rice it kills them.
Y'know what? You're right, I'm sorry. Actually you were a big help tonight. Yeah, and thanks for putting my grandmother in the cab and making sure she got to the hotel safely.
Tell him that you haven't seen your wife in a long time. Tell him that having a long-distance relationship is really difficult. Tell him that what little time we have is precious.
This is Monica! I'm Phoebe's friend. Listen, Phoebe is back with David and he's going to propose to her, and she is going to say "yes" but I know she really wants to be with you!
So I did tell you. Okay, y'know, that really isn't the thing. Umm, the thing is that, right now I'm just in a place in my life where I need to focus on me. Y'know what I mean?
Look, I'm not happy about this either, but y'know if-if Ross says he's happy then we're just gonna have to keep our feelings about Emily to ourselves. Are you cool with that?
Y'know, you called me that before so I-I took the liberty of fashioning a star out of aluminum foil. Now, no pressure, you like my cookies, you give me the star.
Then you two can, can sneak into the cockpit, and things will start to heat up, and then a stewardess comes in... I've been watching too much porn.
Oh no sweetie, no! This is my fault, I wasn't clear! I'm really sorry. And listen, you take as much time as you need to move out okay? There's absolutely no rush.
What is the matter with you?!! Why aren't you more upset?! Aren't you gonna be sad that we're not gonna be living together anymore?! I mean aren't you gonna miss me at all?!
Okay, I'll see you tomorrow! Just so you know, we're not seeing him tomorrow. I-I cannot spend another evening with that man. Do you remember how he behaved at our wedding?
Are you still crying about your damn baby? Pheebs, you gotta keep the line moving, remember, 20 seconds per person. Your see these clowns all the time!
As a joke, this customer at work who has a crush on me gave me a $20,000 tip. His number is on the check, he just did so I'd call him.
I know that switch does something, okay? So-so I went down to city hall and got these. All I had to do was pay $25 and wait in line for three hours.
Anyway um, when he left he forgot to take the poem with him. Now, I am like totally dense about poetry, but I think it's pretty good all right. Check it out.
Hey! Joey said no autographs! But if she's gettting one, then I want one too: To Monica. And none of this "best wishes" crap. I want "love".
Pants and a sweater? Why, mom? Who am I gonna meet in a blackout? Power company guys? Eligible looters? Could we talk about this later? OK.
Look, when it started I was just trying to be nice to her because she was my brother's girlfriend. And then, one thing led to another and, before I knew it, we were...shopping.
You just told me that he hates marriage! That-that he's a-a complex fellow who's unlikely to take a wife! That-that he's against marriage and always will be!
Oh no, it is okay, I mean as long as you know that Chandler and I are also very hot and fiery, just as hot as you! I mean our flame, whew, is on fire!
Well umm, I was thinking that maybe we could come up with a system where we trade of being maid of honor for each other. Like hypothetically, if Phoebe were mine...
Honey, you know I think you're hilarious! Come on, you know that joke you told me last week? The one about Jerry Lewis and the girl with the lazy eye...? That slayed me.
That's because I-I was just grabbing some things out of the dryer, and it's static cling. Or maybe it's just that God knew I'd be running into you and saw an opportunity.
Well y'know, I'm just-I'm just worried that bosses will see them and think they pay you too much money. Or! Or your assistant will see them and-and want a raise!
So great! He showed me where the restaurant's going to be. It's this, it's this cute little place on 10th Street. Not too big, not too small. Just right.
Please... Chandler is the love of my life... ... oooh leather pants! Have Mercy! Ross: So, eh... it's probably gonna be hard for you to leave Boston, huh?
Hi. Uh, my friend here was taking down our Christmas lights, and and she fell off the balcony and may have broken her foot or or ankle or something.
I'm a good person. And I'm a good chef, and I don't deserve to have marinara sauce all over me! Y'know what, if you want me to quit this bad, then all you have to do is...
Oh, and the people are so nice. There's this one guy, Geoffrey, he's the Maitre D., Chandler, you will love him. He is without a doubt, the funniest guy I have ever met.
No, that's not it. It's just that when we were asking him all those questions before, I just... I just realized I don't care if he's the most perfect guy in the world... he's not you.
Do you wanna live outside?! Because it's gettin' cold! She gets tons of catalogs and umm, she'll fold down the pages of the things she thinks that I'd like.
It was so wild. We told them we were the Gunnersens in room six fifteen. Only to find out the Boston Celtics had taken over the entire sixth floor!
Ross and Rachel don't know what they're talking about. I mean its not like their so responsible. Emma is a product of a bottle of Merlot and a five year old condom.
Hi! I'm Monica and I'm gonna be singing "Delta Dawn""Delta Dawn, what's that flower you have on? Could it be a faded rose from days gone by? ..."
You guys are always hanging out in my apartment! Come on, I'll only use my left hand, huh? Come on, wussies! All right, ok, I gotta go. I'm going, and I'm gone.
Well, you're making him a frieze salad with goat cheese and pine nuts, wild nuts, wild rice, roast asparagus, and salmon au croup.
No, if he doesn't like our cookies, too bad, I am not gonna be blackmailed. Look if worse comes to worse, it gets a little warm, we'll call it a theme party.
Okay, I have looked through a bunch of career guides, photocopied and highlighted key passages and put them into alphabetical folders so you can make an informed decision.
No-no, wait! Just let me finish, okay? This isn't something that we just, we just impulsively decided in-in Vegas, this is something we both really want. And it is going to happen.
Please ... if I win the lottery, you guys are not gonna leave me. Someone gave me a basket of mini-muffins last week and I couldn't get rid of you for 3 days!
I think we are getting a little ahead of selves here. Okay. Okay. I am just going to get up, go to work and not think about him all day. Or else I'm just gonna get up and go to work.
All right guys stop it. Rachel, we're very sorry that is a very insensitive thing for us to do. And y'know what? Let us make it up to you, we have two really great guys for you.
And when I told her that I was gonna be moving in with Chandler, she was really supportive. You were so great. You made it so easy. And now you have to leave. And I have to live with a boy!!
God, this adoption stuff is so overwhelming. There's inter-country adoption, dependency adoption.. There are so many ways to go, and this is like the biggest decision of our lives.
Phoebe, you get the bear, uhm, Joey, you get the robot, and Chandler and I get the dog. Ok, and the race is going to go from here to here. Now the one who comes in last, stays!
Oh really, so that hysterical phone call I got from a woman at sobbing 3:00 A.M., "I'll never have grandchildren, I'll never have grandchildren." was what? A wrong number?
Nooo! Okay. Whoa! Okay. See I was, I was a little nervous about turning thirty. So the bus boys took me out for some drinks. I wanna puke on you later!
I know! And four ninety-nine for a pillow top queen set, who cares about the divorce, those babies will sell themselves. And I'm appalled for you by the way.
Well then somebody's snoozing. Joey, not that this uh should affect you at all, but if you were to pick me, I was planning on wearing a sequined dress, cut down to here.
This would be a beautiful place to get married, yeah, but I wouldn't put the aisle there and I would never have the ceremony there! I mean you'd have the ceremony under this big beautiful arch.
No! No-no they're not. They're still very angry! But y'know Chandler is also half-Swedish. You know what the Swedish people are famous for? Sitting down and being quiet.
Go! I have it in my book. Go! Wait a minute! If you're in charge of the invitations why am I the one who has to call her-Hello Mrs. Green! Hi, it's Monica Geller.
Look, not that I enjoy talking about people who I went to high school with, 'cause I do, but umm, maybe we could talk about something else? Like you, I don't even know where you work?
No that was Jarred! Wow! I haven't thought about him in a long time... Anyway, umm Will's, Will's here on business and he didn't have a place to go so I invited him here.
So what, you're not the only one. I mean, half the time we don't know where we're going. You've just gotta figure at some point it's all gonna come together, and it's just gonna be... un-floopy.
Look Ross, the only question you need to ask is, "Do you see a future?" I mean like do you see yourself marrying her? Oh my God! You did it already! You married her, didn't you?!
Hello Greg? Hi, this is Monica from the plane? Listen, the number that you gave me 853-5... That is their old number! Jenny's been giving it out since they moved!
Ok, this is pumpkin pie with mockolate cookie crumb crust. This is mockolate cranberry cake, and these are mockolate chip cookies. Just like the Indians served.
You bet your ass I'm gonna fire you! Get out of my kitchen! Get out!! All right! Anybody else got a problem? How 'bout you Chuckles? You think this is funny now?
Uh, so, uh, Rach, uh... do you wanna save this wrapping paper, I mean, it's only a little bit torn... so are you gonna go for it with Ross or should I just throw it out?
All right. Op, here it is! Right underneath the can of-of bug bomb. I wonder if the best place to put something that cooks food is underneath the can of poison?
That's Great. You know we don't need to talk about this now. Really, I mean this is, is so way, way, way, in the future, I'm talkin' hovercrafts and apes taking over the planet.
Okay, this is the den. All right, check this out. Lights! Whoa! All right. Less lights! Bad lights! Lights go away! Oh, see you just need to find the right command.
Okay, I-I'm sorry. You and Joey, your both focusing on this uncomfortable thing, what you need to do is to change the subject. Next time you see him try to get him talking about something else.
Okay, maybe this will make your teeth look less white. Nope. Okay, colors that don't work are blue, yellow, green, red, black, white, orange, and purple.
Me? What are you talking about? Nobody could steal me from you. I mean, just because I'm friends with her doesn't make me any less friends with you. I mean, you're my...We're, we're...Oh, I love you.
Well, I'll tell you what we're gonna do: We are already late for Phoebe's birthday dinner, so you point out put out that cigarette, we're gonna put this fight on hold and go have sex.
Oh, he just doesn't want us to go through any trouble. Think of how excited he'll be when we go out and surprise him! Plus we get to have our own, ani-Vegas-ary! A-Nevadaversary!
Why would I say anything? That two of our best friends could start the greatest love affair of their lives! And they would have me to thank, and we could all start having babies?
Uh, Michelle. Yeah, that was me, I-I dialed your number by mistake. Oh, you're so sweet. Yeah, we were a great couple. I know I really miss him. Well, you know how it is, it's that....
Yeah, I think we're ready for our first course. OK, um, these are rot-shrimp ravioli, and celantro pondou sauce... ... with just a touch of mints... and... ... ginger.
It's okay. It's okay. Just pretend that it didn't happen! Okay? No one needs to know! I mean, Phoebe's not an official ballplayer! I mean, only official ballplayers can drop the ball!
Okay, Phoebe, y'know what? That-that's it, that's it, all right? No dinosaurs, no ghosts, no giant dogs, okay? They're not the right size, they're not Victorian, and they just don't go.
Well, because we want to get to know her better and she's never been to New York so she wants to see all the tourists' spots... you know, Statue of Liberty, Empire State Building...
OK LET'S GET THESE CHAIRS OUT HERE! Gunther, hit the Christmas lights. Okay, who left the ice sculpture ON THE STEAM GRATE?
Alright you two, I'm gonna go to the bathroom. Now I don't want anything going on while I'm gone. Here's a few things you can discuss: mucus, fungus and the idea of me and Ross doing it.
I'm with you Chandler! I mean I can't have sex with a sick person either, that's disgusting! But I'm not sick! Let me prove it to you. We are two healthy people in the pribe of libe.
See, this is why I told you never get involved with your assistant! And here is no such thing as keeping secrets when it comes to affairs. Did you hear that Chandler? No such thing!
No! But because he thought I was to faaaaa.... And every time I think about it, it makes me feel as bad as I did in fifth grade! Y'know, I-I really think that you should apologize to Julie.
I also, did a little something in fur. But umm, that's really just for me. Okay. So, why don't you go into your room and try these on and we'll see-get a better idea of what's gonna work.
Maybe he's bothering you so much because he likes you. It's like in first grade when Skippy Langwild always pushed me on the playground because he secretly had a crush on me?
I just wanted to say that I hope you do have sex tonight and I hope that you guys get back together, but I must warn you, the night that you announce your engagement I'm going to announce that I'm pregnant!
All right, Rachel, I know-I know you think I'm crazy, please, before you tell him you love him, just-just try to find one person who thinks this is a good idea. Because I bet you, you can't.
I've been doing a lot of thinking. A lot! And umm, well, I came up with a whole bunch of businesses you can do with your van. Okay umm, you could be flower delivery person.
Okay, y'know what, I'm not fine, I'm not. I mean how can I be fine, hearing you come in with her, she wants to see your bedroom.... Y'know what, what if we're friends who don't see other people?
Oh, this terrible! Everything is destroyed! Look at this. It obviously meant enough for me to save it, and I don't even know what it is! Ohh, it's still soft. What do you think this is?
Oh my God! YOU FORGOT THE PIES? Well, I cannot believe this. You force me to make dinner, then you're an hour late and you forget the one little thing that I asked you to do.
Level 1 alert. I repeat, level 1. This is not a drill. Okay we've got a situation. The minister just called. He's snowed in. He can't make it.
You're supposed to double the tax. Not double the tax of Romania. I mean, what's-what's the deal? Are you, are you trying to buy me? Is this the way you get girls to go out with you?
No! But, they're callin' out to me! I mean this little guy even crawled up into my lap. Oh come on, Chandler wouldn't mind if I opened just one present! What do you think it is?
Really? I'm really tired of being your relationship tutor. You're gonna have to figure this one for yourself. All right? Y'know what? If you're too afraid to be in a real relationship, then don't be in one.
Honey, I don't think that's something we need to worry about! First of all he's-he's never gonna tell her how he feels about her. And even if he did you have no idea how she'd react.
We have to do this. We are playing for women everywhere. Okay, just think about every lousy date that you ever had, okay, every guy who kept on the TV while you're making out...
Hey, wait a second. I can help you with this. You just need to be organized. We can make a list of your qualifications, and categorize jobs by industry. There could be folders and files!
Ok, trying to turn me on by making a mess? Know your audience! Besides, tomorrow we're doing those fertility tests and until then you need to keep your tadpoles in the tank.
Windows are clean, candels are lit. Uh, belt's to tight, gotta change the belt. Did I turn the fish? No, cause I made lasagne. Am I out of control?
You don't know everything. Did you know that I'm going out with Rachel tonight instead of you? Hmm? And did you know that the only baby around here is you?! And did you know that I can't even look at you right now?!
And, and, and they wear those little water wings, you know. And they're, they're running around on the deck. Then Hoyt wraps this big towel around all three of them.
Hey Phoebe. Hey, tell me what you think. All right. The house next door to the one that we're buying in Westchester? Just went on the market. I wanna take a look at it, but Chandler doesn't.
Chandler look, I don't want to be one of those wives who says, "You can't go to the game. You have to spend time with me." So, if you could just realize it on your own . . .
Alright, you see these little flower blossoms? They should be facing up, not down, because, well, the head of the bed is where the sun would be. You don't love me any more do you.
Oh, stop beating yourself up! People make mistakes! These things happen! There aren't any message you've forgotten to give me are there? Apparently you're not very good at it! I...
Oh my God, me too! Oh! Oh, we'd be like friends-in-law! Y'know what the best part is? The best part is that you already know everything about him! I mean, it's like starting on the fifteenth date!
Well,fall out of it. You know, you shouldn't even be here, it's a school night. Oh god, oh god. I'm like those women that you see with shiny guys named Chad. I'm Joan Collins.
Well, Rachel wants to take swing dance lessons. Which I think is a really stupid idea! It's dangerous, she's never gonna get what she wants, and who knows who she might end up hurting.
It's not just the drum noise. Every five minutes, Joey throws his sticks in the air, and I have to hear, "Oh my eye! Oh god, my eye!" I mean, it is so annoying.
I don't know! I don't-maybe you're feeling a little resentful. Maybe ah, maybe you thought you'd get married first! Maybe you can't stand the fact that your formally fat friend is getting married before you!
Hi! If you're calling before Saturday, you've reached Monica and Chandler. But if you're calling after Saturday, you've reached Mr. and Mrs. Bing! Please leave a message for the Bings!
Oh please! Dad turned my room into a gym 20 minutes after I moved out! I gotta say, a tanning bed and a stack of Victoria's Secret catalogues, not a gym!
Ok. Oh boy. You are doin' so good. You wanna squeeze my hand? All right, Ross, don't squeeze it so hard. Honey, really, don't squeeze it so hard! Oh, Ross! Let go of my hand!
Aunt Syl, stop yelling! All I'm saying is that if you had told me vegetarian lasagna, I would have made vegetarian lasagna. Well, the meat's only every third layer, maybe you could scrape.
And y'know what, I just realised, in the last year I've only gone out with two guys, Richard and Julio. You gotta help me out here, you gotta set me up, you gotta get me back in the game.
I can't believe I did this. I can't believe I'm singing for the people, and they liked me! Hey, did you hear thatone shouting "look at those tips"! I mean, did I really help you get a lot of tips?
So, how'd the lasagne go over? Really?! Good. So you owe me three pretty things. Yeah, I've been thinking a lot about you too. I know. It's hard this whole platonic thing. It's a word!
Well, we just happen to go to alot of places where you might drink. I mean, how do you go to a wine tasting without having a drink? Or... or to a club, or to the... zoo.
What? Wait! Why? Chandler! Chandler! Wait! I'm sorry, I was just playing for one second! I was trying to find you to tell you that, look if you don't want me to see Richard again, I won't! He means nothing to me!
Aunt Syl, I did this as a favor, I am not a caterer. What do you want me to do with a dozen lasagnas? Nice talk, Aunt Syl. You kiss Uncle Freddie with that mouth?
Yes. Well I got his machine and I left a message. But it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, because you know it was like a casual, breezy message. It was breezy! Oh God, what if it wasn't breezy?
That is exactly why I do not lend you stuff!! Okay?! I mean, first it's my jewelry! And if it's not my jewelry, it's-it's my blue sweater! And if it's not my sweater, it's my sunglasses!
All right. The super couldn't figure out what it did. A $200 an hour electrician couldn't figure out what it did. I've had seven pretty serious shocks. I officially give up.
It took me 28 years to find one man that I wanna spend my life with, if I have to wait another 28 years then, I'll be 56 before I can have a baby, and that's just stupid.
Hi. About last night... I know you are under a lot of stress and even though the things you said hurt me a little bit... My point is, uh, well, I'm willing to take my job back.
Look honey, you don't have to do this, okay? It's the strength you have inside that means the most to me. You're loyal, you're honest, and you have integrity! That's the kind of strength that I want in the man that I love!
I can't believe this, just like 2 weeks ago I was watching Sudden Death, now I'm on a date with Jean-Claude Van Damme. Can you beat up that guy? Can you beat up that guy?
Well, I've tried everything. I give up. I guess I'm not gonna be the mom who makes the world's best chocolate cookies. I do make the best duck confit with broccoli rabe. Kids love that right.
I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! Hi, Tim.
What?! Ross y'know this isn't even about you! I mean this is about Rachel and something wonderful happening for her. I mean you know even if you're right, what if he wants to sleep with her, does it mean he gets too?
Oh, is that so? Ok. If that's really what you want, then here... I give you the headset. Well, I don't really want to give you the headset. Well I guess if you're taking over, you should probably return these messages.
Oh honey, we're close now but you-you wouldn't believe the years of-of nugies, and wedgies, and flying wedgies, and atomic wedgies, and.... That's where the waistband actually goes over your head.
Hello? No, he's not here. Yeah, this is his wife. Yeah, well, it came as quite a shock to me too. I guess I should have known. Yeah, I mean, he just kept making me watch Moulin Rouge.
Fortunately, it is me. And, they made me head of purchasing, thank you very much. Anyway, I just ran into Ross and Chandler downstairs, and they think we should go out and celebrate. You know, someplace nice.
Hey guys this stuff is just so way in the past. You-you've been through so much since then. And right now you've got so much more important stuff going on in your life. Can't you just let this go?
You don't tell me what to do! I tell you what to do! Just call her. She's at the Paradise Hotel in Barbados. And while I've got you, you've got curly hair. What do you do in humidity? Damnit!
All right that's it, I give up! Whatever you want you can have it! You wanna sing a song? You wanna do a dance? You want your mom stand at the Alter and scream racial slurs? I don't care!
Yeah. The great thing about the jam plan was, I was taking control of my life. So I asked myself, what is the most important thing to me in the world and that's when I came up with the baby plan.
Come here! Come here! Sweetie you don't have to worry. No, besides y'know what? I'm gonna have a lot of new things with you. The first time we buy a house. Our first kid. Our first grandkid...
"Hi, it's Monica. I'm just checking in 'cause I got this message from you and I didn't know if it was old or new or what. So, I'm just checkin'. So let me know, or don't, whatever. I'm breezy."
You heard him! "No bigger!" "You're perfect!" "Just don't get any bigger!" Oh my god he sounded just like my high school wrestling coach. You know what? I'm going to have to talk to Chandler.
You went to one where you were popular, and you got to ride off Chip's motorcycle, and wear his letterman jacket. I went to one where I wore a band uniform they had to have specially made.
So Rach! You're the first guest at Hotel Monica! Umm, you'll just have to tell me how you like your eggs in the morning. And I thought I would bring them to you, y'know, in bed. Oh, you have been through so much.
It was soo amazing, he is so sexy, and smart, which makes him even sexier. Oh gosh, I gotta so you this. Last night, we were fooling around and he stops to write a poem.
I don't believe this! Wow, look at this refrigerator! It's gigantic! I mean I could live in this thing! I'd be cold, but I'm always cold. Oh my God, look at these spider burners! I love spider burners.
Please, don't listen to Joey, okay. Would you look at him? He-he's obviously depressed. He's away from his family; he's spending Thanksgiving with strangers. What he needs right now is for you to be his friend.
Okay, I umm, I ran into Richard yesterday and he asked me if I wanted to go for a bite and I did. The only reason I didn't tell you is because I knew you'd get mad and I didn't want to spoil our anniversary.
You know what, maybe I don't need to have children. You know maybe I just think I do because that is what society, and by that I mean my mom, has always convinced me that I... I do, I have to have children, I'm sorry, I just do.
No! No, no... wait! We didn't lose. The rules clearly stated that the last one to cross the finish line was the loser. Well, our dog never crossed the finish line, so technically...
I'm the hostess! Not those guys! I'm always the hostess! I mean, I was always the hostess, I mean even when I was little, I mean the girls brought their dollies to my tea party, I-I served the best air.
Okay. Could the waiters gather around to hear tonight's specials? Okay, first there is a Chilean Sea Bass prepared with a Mango relish on a bag-Why is nobody writing these down?
All right, that I'll retract. But I stand by my review, I know food and that wasn't it. You're marinara sauce tasted like tomato juice! You should serve it with vodka and a piece of celery.
I just ran into Dave and he told me that you blew him off! I mean, you listen to me! Now, I'm calling the shots! I say you leave Ross alone and go get Dave! What the hell were you trying to do?
Okay, we're gonna start in the kitchen. Plates get put into plate protectors and stacked ten to a box. The silverware gets bundled in rubber bands and then bubble wrapped. Got it?
This is so typical. Y'know, we give, and we give, and we give. And then- we just get nothing back! And then one day, y'know, it's just, you wake up, and "See you around!" Let's go, Phoebe.
This isn't easy for me either. I wish things were different, I... If you were a few years older, or if I was a few years younger, or if we lived in biblical times, I would really...
Let's see. Congress is debating a new deficit reduction bill... the mayor wants to raise subway fares again... the high today was forty-five... and- oh, teams played sports.
Oh my God, it was the best funeral ever! I mean, everyone loved the food, and guess what? I even got another funeral for tomorrow-the dead-guy-from-today's best friend. I mean, it is like I am the official caterer for that accident!
Honey, I'm not returning them. Okay? I mean I-I know they cost a lot, but I'm going to wear them all the time. You'll see. Besides, I love the compliments. I mean, have you ever had something so beautiful everyone wanted it?
'Dear Dr. Remore, know that I love you and would do anything to have you.' Gosh. 'Your not-so-secretive admirer, Erica Ford.' Ooh wait, 'PS enclosed please find 14 of my eyelashes.'
Ugh, she's upstairs not doing the dishes! And I tell ya something! I'm not doing them this time! I don't care if those dishes sit in the sink until they're all covered with-I'll do them when I get home!
No, you're right. Mnya, we shouldn't do it like this. Huch. For what it's worth, I'm, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have come down on you so hard about the smoking. So you had a few cigarettes, not the end of the world.
Right. Umm, listen since we're-we-re on that subject, umm, I just wanted to tell you that uh, well, I-I was going through a really hard time in London, what with my brother getting married and that guy thinking I was Ross's mother...
Honey, umm I-I love you, but umm, if you call our wedding a party one more time, you may not get invited. Okay? Listen, we could always earn more money, okay? But uh, we're only gonna get married once.
No, it is me! Y'know, I'm not just the person who needs to fluff the pillows and pay the bills as soon as they come in! Y'know, when I'm with her, I am so much more than that. I'm- I'm Monana!
All right. Umm, you could uh start out with a little 1, a 2, a 1-2-3, 3, 5, a 4, a 3-2, 2, a 2-4-6, 2-4-6, 4, 2, 2, 4-7, 5-7, 6-7, 7 ...7.....7...7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7...!
Fine! Judge all you want to but, married a lesbian, left a man at the altar, fell in love with a gay ice dancer, threw a girl's wooden leg in a fire, livin' in a box!!
All right. Umm, you could uh start out with a little 1, a 2, a 1-2-3, 3, 5, a 4, a 3-2, 2, a 2-4-6, 2-4-6, 4, 2, 2, 4-7, 5-7, 6-7, 7, ...7.....7...7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7...!
Hi, who's this? Hi, Joanne. Is Rachel working? It's Monica. Yes, I know I did a horrible thing. Joanne, it's not as simple as all that, ok? No, I don't care what Steve thinks. Hi, Steve.
Okay, fine but please don't be upset! Okay? I was really depressed okay? And really drunk! I just wanted something stupid and meaningless. I just wanted...just sex. So, when I...went to your room that night...I was actually looking...for Joey.
Well, there's a lot to think about. I mean, how is she, how is she going to handle this financially? How is she going to juggle work? Does she realize she's not going to have a date again for the next eighteen years?
No! No! I shouldn't have even opened these! I mean I-Joey I am out of control!! Joey, you have to do me a favor. No matter what I say, no matter what I do, please do not let me open another present! Okay?
I'm going into business people. I'm sick and tired of being depressed about Richard. I needed a plan, a plan to get over my man. What's the opposite of man? Jam. Oh Joey don't! It's way to hot.
Of course not. I mean gosh, Chandler what you did, it's, it's a wonderful thing and I really appreciate it. I know I have this weird thing where I want everything to be in the perfect place, but I'd never expect you to worry about that.
It's not like, I haven't any opportunities. I mean, y'know, I'm just waiting for the perfect guy. I'm seeing this guy Roger, all right? He's not perfect, but umm, I think maybe I should just get it over with. Y'know, give him my flower.
All right, I'll take one box of the mint treasures, just one, and that's it. I-I started gaining weight after I joined the Brown Birds. Remember, how Dad bought all my boxes and I ate them all?
You know what? This is not over. We will play you again, and we will win, and you will lose, and you will beg, and we will laugh, and we will take every last dime you have, and you will hate yourselves forever.
No! No, she doesn't. Uh Phoebe, what she makes-that's uh-they're sock rabbits. They are completely different-Okay! Okay! Okay! I didn't make it! I'm sorry! I totally forgot about tonight and the fact that we're supposed to make the presents!
Um, okay. You just called a little while ago about needing a signature on the admissions form. Well, it turns out we need a whole new one because uh, you see, I-I, I put the wrong name again. 'cause um...
My stock, MEG, it went up 2 points. Hey guys, do you realize that if I had invested my $127 in myself yesterday that I'd like have...a lot more than that today. Ya know what, I'm gonna do it.
We have too! I mean what if Ross's hears that and then calls her back and then they get back together? Is that what you want? Ross back with that controlling, neurotic, crazy Emily? The Emily that wouldn't let him see you?
Yeah, well you call her and tell her that y'know when we were kids her precious little Frannie tried to undress me several times, okay? And if I hadn't have stopped her, there probably wouldn't even be a wedding to go too.
No, they gave us glasses with lipstick on them! I mean, if they didn't change the glasses, who knows what else they didn't change. Come on sweetie, I just want this weekend to be perfect, I mean we can change rooms, can't we?
So anyway, I'm cooking dinner for him Monday night. You know, kind of like an audition. And Phoebe, he really wants you to be here, which will be great for me because then you can 'ooh' and 'ahh' and make yummy noises.
I can't believe that this whole time we thought he hated us. I mean, isn't it amazing how much you can touch someone's life, without even knowing it?...Would you look at this dump? He hated us. This is his final revenge!
She's this girl who used to live in the building before you did. Then she moved to England and she picked up this fake British accent. On the machine this is her message. "Monica, darling! It's Amanda calling!"
Ok people, I want you to take a piece of paper, here you go, and write down your most embarassing memory. Oh, and I do ask that when you're not using the markers, you put the caps back on them because they will dry out.
Don't stare. Now she just finished throwing his clothes off the balcony, now there's just a lot of gesturing and arm-waving, , Ok, that is either, "How could you?" or, "Enormous breasts!" Here he comes!
Yeah, you were, but you decided to make salmon because you had some left over at the restaurant. And then you realised if you bitched about it, then you would stop cooking, and you would have to make your famous baked potato and Diet Coke.
Yeah-yeah, y'know what? Yeah, that's it-that's it, everything will be mine! Nothing will be yours! That's-that's what I said! Oh come on, Chandler! I'm talking about the barca lounger! It just, it doesn't match! Where is it gonna go?!
See, I've been waiting my whole life to be engaged, and unlike some people I'm only planning on doing this once. So, uh y'know, maybe this is selfish and I'm sorry about it, but I was kinda hoping tonight could just be about that.
No! Really! Any time Ross makes a toast everyone cries, and hugs him, and pats him on the back and they all come up to me and say, "God, your brother." Know what they'll say this year? "God, you"
Okay, all right, how's this? 27. Italian-American guy. He's an actor, born in Queens. Wow, big family, seven sisters, and he's the only....boy. Oh my God, under personal comments 'New York Knicks, rule!'
Joey, I think you should consider something a little less risky. I mean, I think in this market, real estate is your best investment.The Fed. just lowered the rates and the interest on your mortgage is totally deductible. That's right, I know some stuff!
A positive atmosphere! But I-I-I have had it up to here. From now on, it is gonna be my way, or the highway! All right? Does anybody have a problem with that?!! Hey new guy! I said, does anybody have a problem with that?!
All right, listen you're just being silly. Rachel, even with that rumor you were one of the most popular girls in school and everyone wanted to be like you. One girl wanted to be like you so much she stuffed her pants with a Tootsie Roll!
Yeah, but I love you more. Besides y'know, nothing goes with Bing. So I'm screwed. I mean... Oh, hi Emma. Yeah, that's you. You're our little Em. Oh what's that honey? What? Oh, you want a little cousin? You want a cousin right now?!
Guys, hurry up! The flight leaves in four hours! It could take time to get a taxi! There could be traffic! The plane could leave early! When we get to London, there could be a line at customs! Come on!!
'Cause I was going by it the other day and I saw that there was a stock with my initials, MEG, on it and, well, sometimes I have to watch for two or three hours before it comes up again but when it does, it's pretty exciting.
You know what I'd love to do? I would like to go to France and eat nothing but bread and cheese-Not even bread, just cheese. No, I want the bread. Yeah. Ah, and pastries... And pate. Oh, I'm really not high, it's just I used to be fat.
Oh, isn't he? Oh, you know, I really think this time it may work with him. I mean, he just makes me feel so good and I've been feeling so lousy this last couple of months, no job, no boyfriend. Well, at least my cup is half full.
Yeah, y'know, but something like salmon which would be so much more elegant than the chicken. And, you wouldn't have to worry about the salmonella. But of course with salmon you'd have to worry about the chickenella... So, I can't wait to see this place you're getting married!
I will prove it to you! Okay? About a week ago I was wearing those jeans and I dropped a pen in my lap and it left an ink stain on the crotch. Now when she comes back I will find it and show you that stain!
Okay! Wait-wait-wait! Shhh! Okay, umm, I just wanna say that...I love you guys so-so much and-and thank you for being here on my special night. Our special night. I mean it just wouldn't be my-our-our night, if you all weren't here to celebrate with me-us-Damnit!
They've only been going out for a few weeks and Phoebe is completely hung up on Mike! She'll say "No", David's heart will be broken, it will be too hard for them to recover from and then Phoebe will end up alone again.
Oh God, stop with the plan! So what, so what you saw him with a girl? Who cares?! That doesn't mean anything! Now look, you're going to go out on a date with Danny and you're going to be so charming he's gonna forget all about that stupid subway girl.
Back then, I thought that I would never, ever get the chance to go out with a Chip Matthews, and now he's-he's called me up and asked me out. And the fat girl inside of me really wants to go. I-I owe her this. I never let her eat.
Why not?! I mean this has been the most amazing week. Would it be so terrible? Even if we were friends who lived together. Or, maybe someday friends who stood up in front of their other friends, and vowed to be friends forever.
Y'know, let's face it, I'm not a kid anymore! I-I need to be with someone who-who wants the same things that I do! I mean coming to my place of work and telling me that you love me, I want that! Talking about pig sex over lunch, I don't want that!
This place is really my Grandmother's. I got it from her when she moved to Florida, otherwise I could never afford a place like this. So if the landlord ever asks, I'm 87 year old woman, who's afraid of her VCR. So are you thirsty?
Okay, all right don't judge me to much. Okay? Um, but I saw this info-mercial, and um, I swear to you I have never-ever bought anything on TV before, except for this mop. But there was this stuff on leg waxing, it just, it looked so amazing....
Oh sweetie, you can never embarrass me. Okay, you can easily embarrass me. But come on, it doesn't matter. All right? I married you! So I want to dance on my wedding night with my husband. Come on. Just try not to move your feet at all. There you go.
It bit. It was a 50's theme restraunt. I have to cook in a costume and dance on the counter. I mean I was a chef at Cafe des Artistes. I mean how could I take a job where I have to make something called Laverne and Curly Fries?
I'm at work, ordinary day, you know, chop chop chop, sauti, sauti, sauti. All of a sudden, Leon, the manager, calls me into his office. It turns out they fired the head lunch chef, and guess who got the job.
You had a bathroom break at 2030. Pee on your own time, Mike! . Now, in regard to the toast, okay, you wanna keep them short, nothing kills a rehearsal dinner like long speeches. Okay. You just get in, do your thing and get out!
Oh how nice. Maybe later we can all go blow our noses on my wedding dress. Ross comes out of the guest bedroom with the diaper bag and the car seat carrying thingy.. yeah.. thats the techinal term.. He goes to Chandler.
Please, could you just try it for me? Come on, I used all my best stuff! I-I-I lit some candles. I put on some music. I used bath salts, plus bubble bath! And got you this little plastic Navy ship. So it's a boy bath!
Your boyfriend has been in there for over an hour. I can't believe it, it's like I'm living with him again. He's here when I go to sleep, he's here when I wake up, he's here when I want to use the shower, ughh. It's like I'm sixteen all over again .
Leon, Leon. Shhh! Guys. Wait, I don't understand. Those steaks were just a gift from the meat vendor. That was not a kick back. I'll just replace them and we can forget the whole thing. What corporate policy? No. Yeah. All right. I just got fired.
That doesn't matter! We have waited so long for this. I don't care if it's two babies. I don't care if it's three babies! I don't care if the entire cast of "Eight is Enough" comes out of there! We are taking them home, because they are our children!
Oh. Well, I didn't realize that you needed it back right away. I mean, you told me to go and be a caterer. So I went. I beed. I mean, I... I used it to buy all this stuff. But look-I've got another job tomorrow, so I'll pay you back with the money I make from that.
Hey. Oh good-good you're here! All right, I figured it out. I'm gonna take two tables of eight, I'm gonna add your parents, and I'm gonna turn them into three tables of six. Okay? And I called the caterer; I added two extra meals, we are good to go!
You're gonna find a place. But even if - God forbid - you didn't.. So you postpone the wedding. Is that really so bad? I mean, think about it. You could take all the time you needed to get everything that you want. You could have tulips, you could have salmon.... Mmmmm... Salmon!!
Whoa-whoa-whoa, Phoebe you gotta take her! Y'know, I-I-I said some really bad stuff about her, but y'know Rachel has some good qualities that make her a good roommate. She gets tons of catalogs and umm, she'll fold down the pages of the things she thinks that I'd like.
It is not over because she is going to call you and tell you she loves you. And the reason why she couldn't, is because her feelings were so strong, it scared her. Now you go home and wait for her call, she could be calling you from the plane! Come on now go! Go!
I'm getting married!!!! I'm gonna be a bride!!!! No, I will not shut up because I'm engaged! Ohh, big talk! Huh, why don't you come over here and say that to me?! Huh, buddy?! Yeah, my fiancee will kick your ass! Come on, apartment 20! Apartment 20!
If it bothers you that much, just go out and get the shoes. No. Don't do this. This is stupid! I don't have to prove anything, I'm gonna go get them...But then everyone will know. Unless I get them, and then wake up really early and put them back! ...I need help!
Yeah! And if, and if we have a baby one-day, and the doctor hands it to you in the delivery room and you don't cry, so what! And-and-and, and if we take him to college and come home and see his empty room for the first time, and you got nothing, it won't matter to me.
Okay, but if we don't get this house, she's stil gonna show up wherever we go! I mean, at least if she's here, it eliminates the element of suprise. I mean, never again will you have to hear the three words that make your balls jump back up inside your body.
Now, in some of these recipes, the quantities may seem just a little unusual, uh, like these coconut mockolate holiday nut bars. I've indicated four cups of coconut, and four cups of crushed nut, and only, uh, one tablespoon of mockolate.
It's just, I think, there's never gonna be a right time to have a baby. I mean, now you're unemployed and in a little while you'll find a new job that'll keep you really busy. There's always gonna be a reason not to do this, but I think once the baby comes, forget about all those reasons.
Oh, gosh, this is so weird. I mean, his whole life was in this apartment, and now it's gone. You know, I think it would be nice if we just took a few moments, for Mr. Heckles. I mean, he was kind of a pain, he was, but, he was a person. You're all going to hell.
With good news? Of course it is not good news, you just said "Doctor Connelly just called". If it was good news you would have said "Doctor Connelly just called! " But so what is it? Is there a problem, uh? Is there a problem with me or with you?
Well, I thought this would be a great opportunity to use up all the food that I don't want to move to the new house with me! So, enjoy: smoke oyster casserole with a breakfast cereal crust, kidney beans in their own juices, and for dessert, a questionable orange.
Something went wrong with Underdog, and they couldn't get his head to inflate. So anyway, um, his head is like flopping down Broadway, right, and I'm just thinking... how inappropriate this is. Um, I've got something in my eye, uh, Joey, could we check it in the light, please?
No, a guy would be saying, "I'm never gonna get to sleep with anyone else." Oh my God! I'm never gonna get to sleep with anyone else! I've been so busy planning the wedding that I forgot about all the things that I'd be giving up! I mean, I...I'm never gonna have a first kiss again.
All right, look, Ross. I realize that you have issues with Carol and Susan, and I feel for you, I do. But if you don't help me cook, I'm gonna take a bunch of those little hot dogs, and I'm gonna create a new appetizer called "pigs in Ross". All right, ball the melon.
And-and-and if I die, from a long illness. And you're writing out my eulogy and you open a desk drawer and you find a note from me that says, "I will always be with you," and you still can't shed one tiny tear, I know you'll be crying a river inside.
All right, that's a little sketch of the cake, umm some sample menus, umm y'know what I thought we would start out with Tuscan style finger food, and for music, here's an alphabetized list of all my CDs! I've highlighted the ones that would go really good with the food.
Look, I know that you're in a place right now where you really need to hate Julie's guts, but she didn't do anything wrong. I mean, she was just a girl who met a guy, and now they go out. I really think that if you gave her a chance, you'd like her. Would you just give that a chance, for me?
I mean this has been like my dream since I got my first Easy Bake Oven and opened Easy Monica's Bakery. I mean I would kill for this job. I mean I can totally do this job, and God knows I paid my dues. But Pete's just doing this because he has a crush on me.
Boy, I love carrots! Oh! Sometimes I like to put them between my fingers like this and-and hold them down here while I talk to you. Umm, and-and-and y'know if I get really hot umm, I-I like to pick up this knife and-and umm, I-I put the cold steal against umm, my body.
She's living my life, and she's doing it better than me! Look at this, look. She buys tickets for plays that I wanna see. She, she buys clothes from stores that I'm intimidated by the sales people. She spent three hundred dollars on art supplies.
Yeah, I mean yeah, I look great. Yeah, I feel great and yeah, my heart is not in trouble anymore! Blah, blah, blah! Y'know I still don't feel like I got him back, y'know? I just want to humiliate him. I wanna, I want him to be like naked and then I'm going to point at him and laugh!
Now, Mom, everything's going fine, really. Yeah, Ross is great. He's uh, he's in a whole other place. No, he's gone. No no, you don't have to fly back, really. What do you mean this might be your only chance? Would you stop? I'm only 26, I'm not even thinking about babies yet.
Fair? Please don't even talk to me about fair! Fair would've been you wanting to marry me back then! Or fair would've been Chandler wanting to marry me now! Believe me, nothing about this is fair! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing!
Y'know what really bothers me? Is-it's how-how different you act around them! I mean y'know the throwing the tennis games, the fake laugh, the "I'll see you around, Bing!" "Not if I see you first, Doug!" I gotta tell you, I don't like Work Chandler. Okay? The guy's a suck-up.
All right, Chandler get the coats. Erica let's go. Phoebe and Joey, keep packing! Oh my God we're gonna have a baby. All right. We're gonna have a baby! OH MY GOD, WE'RE GONNA HAVE A BABY! Oh God, oh God, I got to sit down, I got to sit down. Ooh!
No-no, it's not okay! It's not! I mean you were just... You're so incredible! You went through all this time and effort to make this tape for me! Y'know I'm just gonna-I, I am gonna make this up to you! I will! I-I am going to cook anything you want in here , and I am going to do anything you want in there!
You are both idiots. The joke is not funny, and it's offensive to women, and doctors, and monkeys! You shouldn't be arguing over who gets credit, you should be arguing over who gets blamed for inflicting this horrible joke upon the world! Now let it go! The joke sucks!
All right, all right! Let's just cut to the chase, okay? You're single. You're single. He gets off work at eleven. She'll be waiting for your call. I'll give him your number if I can get one calamari and one Caesar salad!! I did not yell. I am not putting a dollar in the jar.
I mean, all I'm asking for is just a little emotion! Is that too much to ask after six years?! I mean what? Are-are-are Rachel and I not as close as you guys?! I mean do we not have as much fun?! Don't I deserve a few tears?!! I mean we-we told Joey, he cried his eyes out!
All right, listen up. There is usually only one dress in each size so when they open those doors, fan out. Now, this is what you're looking for! Memorize it! When you locate the dress, blow on these. All right? Three short blasts, when you hear it. Come running.
Ohh, wow! That's great! Oh wow! We really have to start planning! I have, I have a lot of really specific ideas! We should probably get together like four times per week. You can come over to my place; we'll get together before work! What do you say, 6:30, my place? I'm so excited!
Oh-ho-ho, sweetie, sweetie, you gotta stop saying that, now. It's no big deal, it's not even worth mentioning, you see we all do it all the time. See watch this, Ben, Ben, Ben. Ow, Monica bang! Everybody bang. Ben bang. Rachel bang. Bang, Rachel bang! Oh, isn't that fun?
Okay! I will! Mrs. Green? Mrs. Green! It is rude to leave a party without saying good-bye to the host! Yeah, and-and also when someone apologizes to you the decent thing to do is to accept it! Now what I did to you, it wasn't on purpose! But what you're during to me now is just plain spiteful!
Okay, while we're waiting for these pills to kick in, I'm gonna sit you down on the couch. Come on. Get some nice soft pillows under your head, I'm gonna turn the TV on and you can watch whatever you want. And I'm-Sit down--gonna make you some tea. And then, I'm gonna rub your feet.
I swear, I promise. I promise. Oh my God, I'm so excited! {And I just can't hide it! I'm about to lose control and I think I like it! Sorry, just couldn't resist it.} All right, listen let me tell you, do not get her flowers. Okay? Because y'know, she cries when they die, and there's the whole funeral...
Well, if you really think about it, I mean four days is not that long. I mean, I see you Monday before you go to work, and I see you Thursday when you get back, and I always work late on Tuesdays, so really if you think about it, it's really just one day. And well, if we can't make it one day, we've got real problems my friend.
Okay, I was thinking we should have a beautiful guest room, right? With a mahogany sleigh bed and bedside tables with flowers on them all the time! And we could have a roll top desk with comment cards on them so people could say how much they loved staying here!! Okay, whatever, I really haven't thought about it that much.
Chandler, if you thought I was going to get you porn for Valentine's Day... you were right! Apparently, it's about a young girl who moves to the big city, you know, in search of stardom, but ends up having sex with a lot of guys! Yeah, it got four starts! Oh, wait a minute. Those aren't stars. Anyway, you want to take a look?
Hey listen umm, how would you like to get together? Say next Saturday? Okay, how about Sunday? Okay umm, the week after that? The week after that? Y'know what Greg? Y'know what? We are good, interesting, funny people with good questions and if you and your precious Jenny can't see that then... January 15th? We'll see you then! Okay!
Ok, here we go. We need to sort out the tickets as quickly as possible to see if we've won. So does anybody have any ideas how to organize this? Ok, how about this: we divide them into 6 groups of 40, and the remaining 10 can be read by whoever finishes their pile first.
Ohhh, I knew you loved her! Then you need to go to the airport and tell her. You're probably just gonna catch her just as she's about to go to the gate. You're gonna call out her name and say, "I love you!" And she's gonna say, "I love you, too!" And you guys are going to have the most amazing kiss, everyone at the gate will applaud.
I know. Let's try a look...of far off...wonderment. Okay, we'll-we'll gaze into our future and we'll think about our marriage and the days to come. Chandler! What is the matter with your face?! I mean this picture is supposed to say "Geller and Bing to be married," not "Local woman saves drowning moron!" Hey! Don't laugh at him! He's my drowning moron!
This switch thing has been driving me crazy. So I turned it off and checked every outlet. Now, four of them don't work. Which means, one of them has to be controlled by the switch. So, I plugged in things in all four of the outlets that-that make noise, so that way, when I turn it on I just follow the noise and find out which one it is.
Hi, Nancy. Hi, it's Monica Geller. I'm good. Listen, I'm looking for a job in Tulsa. Well yeah, my husband has been relocated...Because I love him! No, I don't want a job in New York. Javo is looking? Oh my God! He asked for me personally? Oh my God! Oh, wow, this is really flattering, but I'm moving to Tulsa. Yeah, so if you would tell Javo 'I'll take it!'
No, look, she's obviously unstable, okay? I mean she's thinking about running out on her wedding day. Okay, fine! But I mean, look at the position she's putting him in! What's he gonna do? Ross is gonna run over there on the wedding day and break up the marriage?! I mean, who would do that?! Okay, fine, all right, but that's y'know, it's different! Although it did involve a lot of the same people.
No. He Teaches A Course On Food Criticism At The New School, So Before We Go To The Movies I Wanna Go By There And Make Him Try My Bouillabaisse Again. Oh, I Cannot Wait To Read The Front Page Of The Post Tomorrow! "Restaurant Reviewer Admits I was wrong about Monica."
How hard is it? No shoes on the furniture. Back to Monica and Chandler's apartment. Amy is sitting on a chair by the bay window looking mad. Joey groans and gets off the phone: The producer from Days left a message on my machine asking why I wasn't at the parade. They said everybody's pissed off at me.. And they all got to meet Santa!
Hi, uh, Richard it's Monica, um, listen I did something kind of crazy tonight, um, maybe I'm getting my period or something, I don't know. Um, anyway, I, I, I beeped into your machine and I heard a message that, that freaked me out, and um, you know what Michelle will tell you the rest. I, I, um, I'm sorry, okay, I, I hope that we can forget the whole thing. Okay, bye.
I really like to say that I'm-um... Y'know what I'd really like to say? I'm drunk!! That's right mom and dad your little Harmonica is hammered!! And guess what! I've been drunk before! And I've smoked a cigarette! And I got a box of Ding-Dongs hidden in my underwear drawer! It's all okay. It's okay because I turned thirty today. And, and I can do anything I want! Because I am a grown up.
It's gonna be really scary. I mean, god. When we have a baby, there's gonna be so much that we're not able to control. I mean, the apartment's gonna be a mess, I won't have time to clean it. What if the baby gets into the ribbon drawer? Messes up all the ribbons?! What if there's no room for a ribbon drawer, because the baby's stuff takes up all the space!? Where will all the ribbons go!?!
It is so weird, I know what I said, but uh, this morning, I was lying in bed I was, I was imagining what it would be like to say yes. I know it's a little sudden, and it's a little rushed, and it's totally not like me to do something like this, but that doesn't mean I can't. Right? I mean I'm-I'm crazy about Pete, and I know that we want the same things, and when I thought about saying yes, it made me really happy.
Chandler, for so long I...I wondered if I would ever find my prince, my soul mate. Then three years ago, at another wedding I turned to a friend for comfort. And in stead, I found everything that I'd ever been looking for my whole life. And now...here we are...with our future before us...and I only want to spend it with you, my prince, my soul mate, my friend. Unless you don't want to. You go!
Emily has probably been planning it since she was five! Ever since the first time she took a pillowcase and hung it off the back of her head. That's what we did! We dreamed about the perfect wedding, and the perfect place, with the perfect four-tiered wedding cake , with the little people on top. Thanks. But the most important part is that we had the perfect guy who understood just how important all that other stuff was.
Absolutely! Now get out of here you!! Okay, I'm running out of places I can touch him! Look, is there something wrong with me? I mean why am I only attracted to guys where there's no future? Either they're too old, or they're too young, and then there's Pete who's-who's crazy about me, and who's absolutely perfect for me, and there's like zip going on! I mean, seriously, does it sound like something's wrong with me?!
Why? Because everything is my responsibility? Isn't it enough that I'm making Thanksgiving dinner for everyone? You know, everyone wants a different kind of potatoes, so I'm making different kinds of potatoes. Does anybody care what kind of potatoes I want? Nooooo, no, no! Just as long as Phoebe gets her peas and onions, and Mario gets his tots, and it's my first Thanksgiving, and it's all burned, and, and I... I...
Phoebe, that's how it starts. I don't need to eat the cake, I'll just smell the icing... why don't I just eat a little sliver, or, okay, just a slice or two. And next thing you know, you're 210 pounds and you get wedged in going down the tunnel slide. Phoebe, honey, I know this is hard. Look, if you talk to him, you're going to wanna see him. And if you see him, you're going to want to get back together with him. I know that's not what you want. Give me your phone.
