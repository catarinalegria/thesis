So then you know?
I think he's shy.
Ross, don't start.
That is never good.
I've still got it!
Isn't that great?
Don't touch me!
You just stay here!
Oh, this is so great.
What if I asked?
The only problem!
You can not do this.
You and me both.
How did it go?
Phoebe moved out.
Anybody tell you?
I'll be right back.
I'll be right there!
Do you not see it?
I love you too Chandler.
Me and Chandler?!
I'm sorry but...nothing.
You really liked it?
How did that happen?
We got some time.
You dated her!
That is not true!
Oh my God, Richard.
Erica, are you okay?
That's a good idea.
That is so sweet!
I'm not touching you.

Take me home!
Oh, you're a grandpa.
We're gonna have sex.
What did you just say?
They're nice guys.
Isn't this great?
Ok, then just go.
Isn't that cute?
What, forget it!
No, no, I don't.
Joey, you don't have too!
So, did you do it?
But... you suck!
Not even close.
Rachel, this is yours.
Phoebe, what are you doing?
Do you all promise?
What were we thinking?
Well, what did you do?
There's our star!
It's pretty clear.
Rachel, you and Mark?!
Can I talk now?
We'd love too.
Phoebe, that is awful!
No! I'm not okay!
Oh, you look so great.
We have a ladle.
Joey, what are you doing?
Make a wish?
Oh, c'mon in.
You're an opthamologist.
And I can't stop you.
You look great too.
You did? How?
How was that possible?
Why did you do that?
Phoebe, what's the matter?
I pick you, Phoebe.
I'm crying here!!
Oh, gosh, I'm sorry.
Oh, we have some...
No time for that!
Not any more.
Do you hear something?
Put it out!!
Why would you do that?
Mom, it's OK.
I know honey, I'm sorry.

That's very funny!
Aww! I love you!
Y'know what's weird?
Don't you just love it?
Here's your key

Does so count!
There was nudity!
And it's a magnet!
She said WHAT?
It's Joey's birthday.
All right, come here!
I need to talk to you.
I can't promise anything.
That other play?
We owe you?!
Oh, put him on!
Well, what's the part?
Yeah, we'll be okay.
What was that bam?
Oh God, I'm so sorry.
Yes, it's twins!
It's gonna be so great.
I'm really not deciding!
It's okay, it's okay.
You're not a senior?
We said six!
What's wrong Phoebe?
After the snap!
She's still mad.

Chandler what do you say?
Sometimes we were.
I guess, in time.
He is so amazing.
Is there a problem?
Oh yeah? When?
You didn't find her?
That is so unfair!
So what do you think?
Oh, this is so hard.
Oh. What's wrong?
Well, what's the job?
You don't have the guts.
Thank you, Pheebs!
It wasn't fun?!
Well put it back.
Because it's my apartment!
Phoebe, wait a minute!
Ross, that is gorgeous!
You're not on TV.
So, let's do this.
I can't believe we're here.
What about my questions?
Here you go sweetie.
Chandler gets pedicures!
He took off?
I know it is the best.
I'm not talking to her!
And you're cute too.
Great!! That's great!
Make it fifty!
Here we go again.
Where's your bed?
Come on, hurry!
I don't want a beer.
I don't want a cat!
Oh, dear god!
We are pretty good.
I'm, I'm really sorry.
Could you not look?
He could hear me.
You have other friends?
Do you have a plan?
What was her name?
Was he crying?
Grab my ass!
Oh! Me too!
Joey, we know that's you.
What? When was this?
Now, that you can do.
Phoebe did the signs!
: hey Joey.
Hey. Where's Joey?
Oh, you're so wonderful.
We'll talk later.
Where ya going?
"See you around?"
Weren't you nine?!
You need one too?
Well do you love him?
My brother, Ross.
Why is it sick?
Not Chandler, just Joey.
They were lovers.
What if they don't?
And Monica knows...
Okay. Here's the thing.
What's with the guitar?
That you're a liar.
Honey, what's the matter?
Honey, we gotta go!
This was your idea?
This is so huge.
Okay, dinner's ready!
How is that gonna happen?
No, sorry sweety..
What? I don't see anything.
It's because I'm scrappy.
Honey, both yours.
Oh yeah. Definitely.
Oh God! I gotta go!
Phoebe, don't get upset!
So we're back on?
Oh, that's too bad.
You sold me out.
Oh my God! Oranges!
Kinda. Oh my God!
I just... can't do it.
She's asleep. Chandler?
What about your breath?!
We're not doing anything.
We both do that!
Hi! There you are.
Ross, there he is.
So we do Supergirl.
Not any more!
Mmmm! It's good!
Shut up, Joey!
Are you still awake?
What's goin' on?
What are you talking about?
Wow, is that Michelle?
Joey, you had the night!
Oh, I already have one.
Okay, did you hear that?
That was me and Ross.
I don't think there's anything.
Make me rich!!
It could be Amanda!
Oh, I fell asleep.
Okay, this one I like!
Because they made me.
Joey that is horriable.
No, I'm-I'm serious!
Oh sweet Lord.
What are you up too?
I can't go to lunch!!
Oh! You're awake!
And it's so clean!!
Yeah. Mine too.
I love you, Pete!!!
Hate that guy!
What-what-what's that now?!
It's Fun Bobby.
Hey, what's going on?
Well, it's getting late.
The fake kind!
How ya feelin'?
You are married though.
What the hell is this?
I hope she's OK.
Oh God. I'm so sorry.
You are just the sweetest.
Have you seen Chandler?
That's not totally true.
You can't marry him!
Hi, come on in.
I punched you...?
Hmm, bite me.
Can I adopt you?
Ohh. Oh! Ohh!
Yeah! I think that's great!
I gave you one job!
And listen to this...
I'm not sure about this.
I don't know why I'm here.
I'm so happy for me.
Joey that is so sweet.
You keep saying that.
I'm really gonna miss you.
See you guys later.
It sounds interesting!
You're meeting Richard?
I really wanna have a baby.
Ohh that's sweet!
Rachel always cries!
Ohh! Yeah, I forgot.
Joey, do you work here?
Why would we do that?
Oh, yeah, that's true.
Chandler, I think I'm sick.
Yeah. Where were you?
What did you tell them?
Ohh, how is he?
Yeah, Ginger something.
It doesn't say that!
I don't think I'd care.
Over here dad.
No, give me the...
I think you're my favorite.
No! You have lasagnas!
Oh. Hi, Mr.Heckles.
One two three.
What?! What are you doing?!
Joey, what's going on?
Wait! What about Joey?
Would you please go?
Aww, not right now.
Oh my god, then...
No no no no.
What's the big deal?
That's just good sense!
Sorry we're late.
The head tilt?
You don't have any stuff.
Oh my God! Oh my God!
I'm kidding! I'm kidding!
Oh boy me too!
Phoebe, is this the recipe?
Oh, honey, the earrings...
So sexy. Honey.
Really?! How much?!
You know what? You're right.
I know! I know! I know!
Well Rachel's not here!
How did work go?
Watch the thorns!
Well, thanks anyway.
No I told you I can't.
Okay, I'm not getting this!
Hey. Whaddya doing?
Oh, that'd be great.
Are you okay, sweetie?
Okay. I love you so much.
Hey umm, what's this?
Oh my God! What happened?
What have I not told you?
Oh, so who won?
...Yeah. Yeah, I do.
Hey! Good luck!
Hey! Where's Mike?
My surprise party!
What? We could do it!
Phoebe, that stuff is...
Joey! You're doing great!
Oh, that's sounds great.
Then what's the problem?
Okay, Chandler, you go first.
Thanks. I think you got it!
I think I need a drink.
Hey, where is everybody?
What did he tell you?
Umm, well, he's...
Go! Go! Go!
Shh!! Wait, what?
Dad, I'm the twinkie.
I look like a man??
Don't you have to pee?
Oh THATS ME!
That's right, I got mine.
I thought you hated him?
Oh no, wait! Joey!
Hey! Happy Anniversary!
Hey! I didn't know either.
Anything but stew.
The three of us?
You really think this is okay?
I mean, was it Gina?
And six others.
And now your cell.
You have to go to London!
Are you sure you're okay?
D'you want to?
You don't need a shower.
What do you think you're doing?
W-wait. What is that?
He doesn't have anyone.
Alright, let's see..
Thank you so much Phoebe.
Guys! I'm not pregnant.
You bought a boat?
I don't have an atlas.
No! You can't do that!
Ooh, I want one...
Why is Ross naked?
It's good to see you too.
'Kay, here you go.
Fine, go have sex.
God, you are so strong.
Hey sweetie. Oh good.
Are you mocking me?
Somebody likes you!
Hey how was dinner?!
Okay! Ohhh no!
I'm going to get bigger!
So how was Joan?
Hey, where have you been?
The oven is on.
Joey. Erica, baby!
Uh, wait, backstage?
Are these the shoes?
So glad you came!
Can we come in?
You have to tell David!
Okay, I'm up! I'm up!
What the hell happened?!
Don't touch her!!
Nope, she's perfect.
What is the big deal?
Give it. Give it.
All right, you're hired!
Oh, then go Vassar.
Run, Phoebe, run!
Oh yeah right there!
Give me one more.
What?! Which one?!
Wow, this really sucks.
Oh my God! You're good!
Hi...May I help you?
I can't! I have to work!
Honey, what's going on?
That's not even a game!
I lost our mattresses.
But she liked us.
Are we still on that?
In like a half-hour?
Really you can do that?
I drew you a bath!
What can we do for you?
Can you blame him?
You think this is clever?
Oh, that's great! Congratulations!
What happened to Janine?
I'm not always that bad!
Alright, we have to talk.
Chandler, what were you thinking?
Oh my God! I love that!
Hey! How'd it go?
Yeah, no, me neither.
Hey, you wanna see something?
What is going on with you?
This bottle opener.
I know, it is isn't it?
Light still out?
I saved you a seat.
No, she's out shopping.
Another good point.
OH! Oh, oh!
To use the bathroom.
What kind of changes?
Hey! Don't be a baby!
Oh, okay. No problem.
Hey, have you seen Rachel?
You dropped it off?
I do not like that woman!
So far so good!
Oh-my-god Rachel! Rachel!
Rach? What are you doing?
We can't afford that.
Oh my-Oh good God!
No, I really, really do.
Good for you, Joey.
What did they do to you?
Joey, promise me something.
I was frustrated with you!
Again, you're welcome.
Would you just open it?
Star in a movie.
Lots of responses.
How did you get in here?
Oh, she's gonna love that!
I hear wedding bells.
Ow! Ow! Ow!
That was a good day!
I never knew that either.
Oh my God! I love him!
And you're not gonna do that.
Okay, okay. I hate this.
What are you guys gonna do?
Are you really gonna do this?
...I can imagine.
Damn! It's empty!
Oh, honey, that's incredible!
What? I didn't say anything.
Eldad, this is Rachel.
I'll take care of it.
I bet this will work!
Oh... How are they?
You don't even know me...
Happy birthday dad.
What is she talking about?
You're Lewis Posin.
He hates to lose.
So, what's your name?
Oh give it a rest!
I've been pretty good!
Ooh, and I can do this.
Oh May 15th.
Congratulations!/Good for you!/Great!
Huh, wanna bet?
Rachel, that's all we do.
I love this friend thing!
It's like two miles!
Well, you're-you're sweating.
That's Bill Clinton.
Uh-oh, it was bad?
I have nothing to say to you.
I am. I'm that stupid.
Uh, we're gonna be great.
Nancy doesn't smoke!
Yes, you are so smart!
Joey, that is not gonna work.
The sun is out!
So what're you gonna do?
Ha! My point!
Have you seen Chandler?!
Yes you did. Absolutely.
What's that supposed to mean?
Where were your parents?
Oh my God, Rachel! Hi!
Okay. That was her right?
'I am Bea.'
I-I-I think you look great.
He asked you out?!
Thank you soo, much.
All right then. Bye.
So what's Phoebe like?
Give me the good stuff.
Oh my god good?
Not now, I'm sick!
Yeah, in-in-in the bathroom.
It's gonna be so hot!
You really ok with it?
That was a long night.
Well, what were you gonna say?
I really need to talk to you.
This is so much fun!
What's hard to believe?
Yeah, I'll have a scotch...
Hey, I know I what I want!
A couple of days.
Are you guys gonna be okay?
Know when to stop.
Oh and you know what I want!
What took you so long?
Mine? Right here?
No, space doody!
Them?! Who's them?
You're not supposed to look!
No, that seems about right.
What? Who says that?
Waaay too special.
Man's got a point.
What was the dream about?
All right, be my guest.
Uh-oh, what's the matter?
How does she do that?
You flicked me first.
That's not even a word!
I'm just easing you in.
No, I haven't seen him.
Ok, here, watch this.
No, I will not cave.
We're just making conversation.
Y'know, I never saw that.
I think we found a place.
Yeah, I thought it was cute.
Go ahead Rach.
Um... hi there.
Yeah, thanks. You know what?
Well no, but um.
God Ross, what is that?
Very good, so good.
You have got to go home!
Why would I have the keys?
Honey, you don't have to do this.
And who laminated it?
Eh, you work for that.
You used to have carpet.
He's... our age.
I know. I just can't find...
Phoebe, I did not have sex.
Oh, why is it unfair?
Ooh, Phoebe, you look great!
And his puppet too.
Would you look at them?
What's Phase Two?
I can't believe you bought this.
That's how old you are.
You'd better run!
Son of a bitch!
Thank you. They're yours.
How-how did that happen?
Did she really say that?
What? It's still going on.
No, I just talked to them.
How's it going with her?
Joey, speed it up!
So I'm kissing everyone?
I paid to have this done.
Well what did you send?
Why do I have to decide?
I'm not your best friend?
Guys, what's going on?
You didn't know that already?
This doesn't feel weird!
Is it a good play?
Just waiting for you sweetie.
Why is everything different?
These are for Erica!
Here, let me try.
Well, it matters to me!
No, not here. Maybe here.
What are you supposed to be?
Alright, alright, alright...
I mean really, think about it.
You said that was sexy!
Who's Mr. Girabaldi?
I'm gonna miss you so much.
Phoebe! Phoebe, open up!
I'm getting married next!!
That's insurance fraud.
Why don't you just call her?
What is the worse part?
So, how'd it go?
Yeah, well, is that better?
Okay, here's your penis!
So what'd he say?
Well you should be embarrassed.
Okay, umm, you're a loon.
We won't. 300?
Ross didn't scare you?
Oh no no no no!
But my clothes are-ohh!
So do them for free.
But we can go, right?
Oh no! What's the matter?
Just subtract twelve.
Everybody get your toys!
What the hell are you doing?!
He took my snack!
I thought she just had one.
Ooh, this always happens.
You're a really good kisser.
Did you just flick me?
Hey, it's good to see you!
Okay. Ow!!!!! Ow-oh-oh!
How who wears it?
That can't be your father.
Ah, the other Jack.
Hey! Did you find them?
Joey's bare ass!
Oh, god help us.
Oh, here's a great one.
You have dinosaur checks?
Happy New Year.
Aww, honey I'm sorry.
Chandler, why would you do that?
Rachel locked the door.
Put your head back.
What are you guys doing here?
No. I hate this part.
In...in two weeks.
Wow! You are really fast!
Fine! Happy Anniversary!
It's so good, isn't it?
Hey! You're wearing pants!
What are you trying on now?
Hey! So what do you think?
Hey, let me tell them!
Jeez! What is with you?
Alright, I'll be right back.
The thing we never do.
Hello, Mr. Heckles.
Let's go big bunny!
But we love our house.
I mean don't you trust her?
Wait, you like them with me.
Do you wanna go hunting?
How do you know a mugger?
Not at these prices.
Who are you talking too?
One Two Three...
That sounds like Nana.
All right, check me out.
No, here's your mail.
The best man? Wow!
Well, maybe you don't need them.
No. See you don't understand.
Oh no-no-no, it's still me.
Well, bye for me too.
All right, what's going on?
I'm changing out of this.
Yeah, I'd really like to.
We only ordered one!
Regular or decaf?
No that's, that's okay.
Clearly we were wrong.
Joey, you have to talk to her!
Oh my God! That's wild!
Well, apparently she does.
There were only twelve.
Who's David Lynn?
Come on, no peeking!
Bye sweetie, I love you.
OK, um. Goodbye.
Yeah, that's a big step.
It's clearly an Emma.
Yes! Have you seen it?
Y'know what, I like Kathy.
I am, aren't I?
Yeah. Don't do the dance.
Chandler, sense the tone!!
Pheebs, how's it going?
Oh no, we can't walk!
Oh my God, that's Charlie!
I'm so glad you liked it.
Can I ask you a question?
They hurt so much!
This is all of your things.
We were playing a game.
...What did I ask?
I wanna wear this everyday.
So, are you ready to go?
We're switching rooms.
You didn't hear the speech!
Phoebe, you are a bad ass!
I don't feel good right now.
Phoebe, it's not about quantity.
No really, they're OK.
And he's a great brother!
Then why are you laughing?
Now, open your eyes.
It's Chandler! Are you OK?
They've arrested Monica.
Yeah, but without the costumes.
Barry who you almost...?
Why did you hire me?
Chandler! What are you doing here?
Well, what about his family?
I'm engaged!!!!!! I'm engaged!!!!
Well, thanks, we like him.
Who the hell are you?!
Hi, nice to meet you!
What's wrong with PBS?
It's very interesting, Phoebe.
I am not high maintenance!
Who, who are they?
Worked like a charm.
I thought that was a good thing.
Let's get the show on it!
Okay, what's going on with you?
Well, I was having a conversation.
When were we not friends?
Well, I hope you're happy!
Gotta keep squishing.
You did a minute ago!
Was it really that good?
I would love to do it together!
Well you did a little bit.
What's with all this sand?
And that's Pete's Mom.
Um, Pennsylvania Dutch.
About nineteen pounds.
Ugh, I thought you were Rachel!
Wh-wh-what are you doing here?
That's not 'til Thursday.
I'm not gonna go out with him.
It's hard for some people!
No-no, don't-don't-don't do it!
Yeah? The work problem?
Phoebe, where's your purse?
Well, you're not working either.
Ross, thats my jacket.
Oh yeah, what's the plan?
Y'know what? You are right?!
I got you the foot massager.
Does anybody want these?
That doesn't seem fair.
I can't believe you didn't tell me.
We're with you. We got it.
Thunder being stolen!!
It's Monica, open up!
Y'know maybe a little bit!
Look at you with all the guys!
And Rachel. And that's Chandler.
Yeah! She's right in there!
Alright, 5 more minutes.
Hello. Oh, hey Ross!
How did you get in there?!
Chandler, why are you doing this?
Hey, Rach, how was work?
Hell, I wanna see Joey.
I can't believe it! I lost!
I...I have to fire him.
What else did you think about?
Oh, wait a minute honey.
So how does it look?
Yeah, I'm sorry. I really am.
Now calm down Joey.
I'll pick it up for you!
It's almost our anniversary!
Then why are you smoking?
Ow. Ow. Ow.
Look at you. All jealous.
Come on Rach, let's go.
The good stuff, huh?
Oh, now you want a pad.
Hey Phoebe! Guess what?
This is my favorite part.
He is right, isn't he?
You kissed another woman!
How about Mockolate mousse?
No, just a Friday night.
Hey, you've got a boyfriend!
Oh, none for me. Thanks.
Alright, you wanna feel better?
Well actually, Ross doesn't.
There's the man I married!!
Wow! You made a profit!
Is it the Italian guy?
How was your first day?
What is wrong with you?!!!
I never stop thinking about it.
You want some help with that?
Well, she saw the ring.
Never done that before.
Oh, I'm- I'm so sorry!
Yes, he is. Me.
You don't know military time?
Oh my God. Richard? Hi!
It's for their own good.
You can, I know you can!
I do not have baby fever!
Joey, we have something to tell you.
Awww. But still no.
Yes, you're having a boy!
No Phoebe I am mad!
I know. Closing credits.
His indian name?
Hi, glad you could come.
And who pays for that?
So, did I hear Poconos?
Rachel said everything was okay.
Well, I-I-I-I... I don't know...
I highly doubt that.
Two thousand dollars?
Yes! Okay! Okay! Wait-wait-wait!
From here to the airport?
All right? What's going on?
You really think that'll work?
Because then I don't have to!
Yeah! I bet I can do it.
Joey?! Oh my God, Rachel!
Y'know, just be there for her.
Oh man! I did it again!
Hi Pheebs, what's up?
She stole my jeans!
See he's nice. Right?
Oh well, it's not so bad.
Honey! Dinner's ready!
Why? Because of the government.
Oh my God, you're a freak.
Okay, it's ready. Come on.
Here's your tea Phoebe.
Here, let me help you.
That was gonna be my opener.
So, you're ready to do this?
I'm sorry, my friend Phoebe...
This totally makes sense!
Oh my God, this is horrible!
How about fifty bucks?
What are you doing with those?!
Yeah. That-that was the problem.
Oh, did you catch him?!
Yes that would be lovely.
What!? You faked it?
Are you serious? Oh my God.
Oh yeah, I totally agree.
Did she leave a number?
Yeah, he's gonna work on that.
That's what you say about porn.
Wanna give me a hand?
Best out of three?
Really, is he a swimmer?
Is Amanda here yet?
Alright, here you go, sweetie.
You stole them from me!
This isn't even my dress.
Sure, I love this part!
Well, we certainly are alone.
Hey, aren't you up next?
I so wanna be attracted to you.
That would be a good idea.
What are you smiling at?
He's gonna eat the cake!
She will be after tonight.
Okay, hold on a sec.
If you want, I'll do it.
Honey, you gotta talk to her.
His dancing partner?!
All right, so what do you say?
So you had fun, huh?
Well then get it, get it!
You realize what you are don't you?
I don't know what else to say.
Would you like something to drink?
What the hell are you cooking!
He's retiling my floor.
How'd you pay for them?
Maybe this wasn't your shot.
We are not going to whistle.
We'll be waiting for you...
Just uh, do the right thing.
Hi, Chandler. There you are.
You wanted it to be a surprise.
That I was going to eat him.
Then why did you move?!
Well, don't 'cha wanna?
Let me ask you a question.
That is sooo not true!
In case it happens.
Why don't you just get a roommate?
Alright, who wants to do it?
Ok, um, I'll go with you.
Oh, there's banana on it.
How desperate am I?
And what else is it not?
Okay. Don't you want a cookie?
Rach, wait, I can cancel...
You're plans were with us.
Oh my God, it was incredible.
So have you called her yet?
It's a... It's a boy!
That's a good call. Right.
How about, you're moving!!
Stick out your tongue.
Okay. Let's bring it in.
Why did they get divorced?
I'm not a baby, you're the baby.
They're still in my coat.
I'm still all those things!
Oh... what does that mean?
There's more beer, right?
I can't believe you're getting married!
Just the matter of ...payment?
It's just that, it's so much.
Phoebe, it's been two days.
So, what are you saying now?
Wait Chandler, what are you doing?!
Oh well, where is he?!
Chandler, where are your tools?
Wait, he's not here yet.
Really? The scientist guy?
That's what it sounded like.
Who wants it? Anybody?
What? Why, why would...
Please, I'm not going for anything.
Uh sorry, wrong number.
You think we're being obvious?
Well, I just lost my erection.
Not as each other!
Some moms do that.
Joey! Now that you're here...
Wafer thin ice!
Still smoking cigars?
So um, who was she?
Does it involve clogs?
Does it involve travel?
I don't know, clean places?
Well, we had a little fight.
Oh. Can I have a tissue?
Oh, is everything in the car?
Yep, we wanna get married!
Yeah, we're trying to get pregnant.
'I drink tea.'
You need to give him money.
Well, it just seems that...
Does it have to do with Joey?
But you told them you weren't?
What were you doing in Africa?
Hey, did you pick a roommate?
Joey, you don't have to finish that.
Oh. You're not gettin' it.
Hi.. how was the game?
What are you barking at?
Hey, did you stop by here?
Oh yeah, what are you reading?
Really? I don't really feel like it.
Excuse me Mr. Mexico.
But ehm...what is it not?
Did you break up with her?
It's 9:30 in the morning!
Well...I'd better get going.
I don't think this number's right!
Oh wait.. What are you doing?
Okay I'll take her, here.
Ow, what are the chances!
You just carry that around?
Scary pigeon's back?
So! He'll understand!
THAT'S NOT ME!
Okay Marjorie, hit it.
That was the adoption agency...
We're okay. I'm still ovulating.
I'm so glad you liked them!
Wow! Don't you look nice?!
I feel terrible, I really do.
Let me get you some coffee.
We have got to wash that!
I was the pile of coats!
This doesn't concern you!!
Ross, I thought you were over this.
That was a terrible throw!!
You're so efficient. I love you!
Okay, now you're even cuter!!
Yep! You got the tickets?
What uh-What did you-What?!
Too strong for me?
When did I sign for it?
Well, who's voice was that?
That's not really how it works.
I know. I need more pie.
I can't believe we're living here!
We are! Help us!
Makes me wanna puke!
Oh my God! Let me see.
I used to wet my bed.
And slept with the professor.
Just some stuff for the party.
So'd you guys have fun?
Crematorium Chris? Sure!
Hey, Rach, how's it going?
You painting his toenails?
Oh, you are so great! Thank you!
Ooh, are you gonna do magic?
Are you sure you wanna do this?
Ohh my God, I'm so sorry.
Why else would we be here?
Chandler, this actually bothers you?
Oh, I ordered mine first.
So, where do you want to go?
Yeah, but I don't think we have time.
No, no! Give it to me!
Deal! TIME LAPSE.
NO, NO, NOOO!
Hey Joey, come taste this.
Are we gonna take a limo?
That noise you just made?
You're not gonna mess it up.
What have you heard me sing?
Joey! I'm so proud of you!
Kiss him, you fool!!
I was in too much pain.
Score! Now can we go?
Wait what-wh-wh-what are you doing?!
...and head to Canada!
Sometimes I have bad dreams.
What are you doing with the lamp?
Well, uh, I ate some.
Does seem pretty perfect.
Okay, I think I get how to do this.
Or Spin the Bottle?
Oh, why? Why? What happened?
That's that weird voice again.
'Cause you invited your assistant.
Oh, let's not tell this story.
Chandler is such an idiot!
Um, I'm not actually Amish.
Oh, dad, turn it off.
Okay, I freaked out a little.
No-no-no, no! It's sensual!
Let her finish, doctor.
We didn't order cake.
How, how did that happen?
Why don't you just take it with you?
IT'S THE HUMIDITY!
Viva Las Gaygas!
Yeah, well they suck too.
You become friends after?
Really? Your work laugh?
Come here. Okay, be right back.
Yeah, I'm sorry. I'm-I'm so sorry.
Men are such idiots.
No you can't. She's yours!
Your mother told you this?
Pete's breaking up with me.
I'm a cool, fun aunt!
Okay, we're gonna need a distraction.
Nooooo. You're really not going?
Oh. Why didn't you take her?
You know, a party, or--
How? I don't have any money.
It doesn't make any sense.
Wait! Did you say 'G.Stephanopoulos?'
We checked. A lot.
Hi, I'm Ross's little sister.
Okay well that's good to know.
Just go get some! Go!
How 'bout just a boom?
Guys, we bought the tickets.
It's "Bolero" from "10".
You mean your pink shirt?
Ten dollars an hour.
Which one is which again?
Hey, guess what I'm doing tonight.
Yeah but I'm not keeping it.
I thought there wasn't a ball?
Does that sound like Janice?
But, I just cleaned the bathroom.
Try feeding her again.
Okay fine, now Ross...
Oh, so you like her too Chandler?
Score!! 7 to nothing!
Hey. It's him. Who is it?
Wow, what's the bad news!
Why isn't it working out?
Could not be more terrified.
You're not just saying that are you?
So, did you know Ross well?
That's right Patrick, bye-bye!
Nothing. I'm gonna take a shower.
She's in her room, why?
You still work at the multiplex?
You did it! You got ordained?!
Dammit, dammit, dammit!
Lucky bastard! Janice.
Thirty-two! Seventy-one! Hike!
About a half an hour.
We can't split them up!
I can't tell you. It's a secret.
Because the winner gets this!
Hi! Hey look who's here!
All right, everybody open them!
Okay-okay, I got it. I got it.
Oh, I'm gonna kill those guys.
I told you not to go down there!
Wow, you worked in a mine?
Love is the best medicine.
Oh-ho-ho, we've got company.
No, sweetie, I-I trust you.
Do you want me to pick you?!
And I would have to say pah-huh.
Really? Who's number two?
So, what have you guys been doing?
Two girls and a boy?
You know what? You can have mine.
Did you just smell my hair?
Yes? ..yes, she is.
I know, that's why I said again!
Phoebe, stop writing about us!
Pheebes, you know what I'm thinking?
All right, what's goin' on?
What?! You said he was sweet!
And I'm going to go get drunk.
You're right. Maybe I shouldn't go.
You know what? Let's not talk.
I can't find garbage bags!
Well, I guess now we can't go.
Pass the cheese, please.
Call us when you get there.
Phoebe, you'll catch pneumonia.
We're never gonna find anybody.
Oh, wait, and I got a beeper!
Who? Is that your sister?
Joey! You didn't even know her!
What about your massage client?
No, that is what the game is.
Wasn't there a little song?
Hello? It's the deli again!
That's probably what they'll say.
007 gets all the ladies.
Rachel! Let me in! Rachel!
I knew you didn't get a 1400!
Phoebe, what, what happened here?!
You al-you already had it?
I'm actually with her on this one.
I'll give you really good odds.
Why are so mad at him?
Rach, did you check the machine?
Oh wait I forgot my wrap.
Chip, is Chip Matthews.
Then I've gotta go. Bye.
No it's not, it's second.
See if he has ice.
All right, I'll try not to.
Put all my money in me.
Fine, I can do it. Whew.
That's right. Did you hear something?
He might still show up.
But Chandler lent you money!
Soakin' up all the culture.
What about the rest of Manhattan?!
Is that a bit you guys do?
Wow! She is pretty, huh?
Not a basset, a bassinet.
Okay, you ready to open yours?
Nana liked it rough!
From the tequila factory?
Does that smell bother you?
Oh, no no no no no.
So, should I call him back?
You guys, I am not that bad!
It might be kinda cool.
I thought you could use the help.
I used to love to play restaurant.
Hon, you gotta talk to Joey.
Bye... bye... BIRDIE.
Hugh! Hugh Grant!
One-Mississippi. Two-Mississippi. Three-Mississippi.
W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-...
I know! What is this, 1985?!
Just don't pick up your phone.
Joey, you know you don't actually have one.
Then why would he say it?
Did you go home and change?
Did you make brownies today?
What is the matter with your hand?
Something to remember me by!
Oh, I can't pass for 22?
Uch, you see, I'm ovulating.
Okay! All right! Let's do it!
Okay, you come up with an idea.
Are you saying I smell bad?
Maybe, do you need a tissue?
Then I won't have to kill you.
Hey, I thought you already had one.
Yeah I do rock that one.
Ooh... she backed out.
Aw, it's soo unfair.
I'm talking about me having a baby.
Okay, can we please go eat?
What?! You slept with Jason?
You owe me 20 bucks.
So she's a woman! So what?
Twelve dollars an hour.
Excuse me, where are you going?
Honey, sweetie, by the edges.
Oh, he's catching up to her!
We'll put buckles on it.
You're kidding! Where? Where?
Hey Chandler, wanna do it with me?
... everybody we know? Yeah.
Was your cabin pressurised?
Oh my god, what were you thinking?
Oh, we're not seeing a movie!
Wh?! What about my allergies?!
You used the Europe story!
Who wasn't invited to the wedding.
Wow. Joey, how do you do it?
"Marriage. It's not for everybody."
Why don't you just go out with her!
I wasn't. Let's get going!
You wanna get out of my face?
Hi, how are you doing Kelly?
Yeah? I'm proud of me too.
Yes, but we have to be fast.
No, no, no, that's Dina.
We didn't give you any money!
Hey, are we still on for tonight?
Yeah, okay, give that a try!
Well, that's it. Everything's packed.
Why the hell did you take her?
Is he gonna introduce us?
You just wanna each take one?
So, what are we gonna do today?
What did I tell you about the hall?!
Hey Joey, sweetie, taste this.
Just go over and say hi.
Well, you're not gonna get going are you?
Haven't we made this decision?
We just want you to think it through.
Ok, you have to stop playing now.
Hey Pheebs, how's it going?
Uh, where do you think you're going?
Oh, we're not doing that. Okay...
This woman's living my life.
Yes, they can stay with us.
Yeah, I think you should keep looking!
And this goes for all guys?
Okay mister! Fertilize me!
Oh! So you think I'm a failure!
Okay. Umm, Phoebe, you suck too.
Hey, what did you guys do today?
Oh my God, I was thinking four.
Wh-what are we gonna tell him?
This is your current cellphone?
Okay, he was talking about rules.
Oh my God! Kyle Lowder!
I'll get back to my new job.
Phoebe, we lost half of them.
Oh my God, we're gonna be parents!
See? It's no big deal.
Why do you want to see my hand?
What is it?! What about Pete?
Sure, what do you have in mind?
Oh my God, what are you gonna do?!
Can you believe Phoebe got pregnant?!
Ooh...hey honey, are you all right?
Well, you tell a lot of jokes!
That was a half an hour?
Really? If that's what you want...
Oh my God! Are-are you crying?
What, he doesn't like Josh?
We didn't get anything for anyone.
We need to talk to you about something.
Yeah, just like the one in the poem.
Rachel's really the one who's pregnant.
Wow! That is a great picture!
No one wanted seconds, right?
Phoebe, your liver is right here.
Hey, you got me, put it in.
Anything larger back there?
You start working on that list.
No, I'm wearing a wedding dress.
What kind of karate is that?
Spoon? So, what do you think?
Where did you get those jeans?!
But you live here! You know that.
I've gotta get back in the game.
Thank you Joey, thank you so much!
Dr. Burke, it, it's me.
Relax! It's Phoebe! Not you!
Fine. Go! Go! Go!
This is not the bed I ordered!
Yeah! Roses or Lilies?
I can't believe you let them win!
God bless you Chandler Bing!
Oh, look, he's waking up!
What a minute, what did he say?
Yeah, it takes two incomes.
Hi, that's what I'm doing for Phoebe!
You what? You said you liked them.
It was a really beautiful service.
Really, you want to wait a year?
The wedding starts at six.
Hey, you wanna go to see a movie?
Feeling a little better sweetie?
Ross, he's got the remote again.
So-so you would've just lied?
Yeah, come on, we can be guys!
I miss Rachel. No, my parents.
Oh, you got the whole night, huh?
Don't you love the huge yard?
That thing is not coming in here.
I didn't take a pregnancy test.
Hell no, we'll pay!
Do you think he knew I was here?
Third door on the left.
What? I-I said you had a-
Oh, I'm sorry. Can I get you something?
Promise me you'll be careful.
Cause I already invited her.
Pete, can I get you something else?
What if I turn out the lights?
You gave her food poisoning!?
I'm sorry, idea time is over.
I have to be up in seven minutes.
That is a slap in the face.
Well then we still have a problem.
Name one of his books.
So, what do you think we should do?
Okay, throw it straight this time.
All right, we should call somebody.
Yeah, but at least I'm doing it!
Sit down! We're winning!
I clunked your heads together!
Stop it Chandler. I'm sorry too.
What if they get mixed up?
He's totally flirting with you too.
That's-that's not Phase Three.
Yeah, he's just gotta get a shot.
Yes. But all the other ones.
Phoebe, you're gonna be with your grandma?
Sweetie, I wanted you to have him too.
So you hit her in the face?
Oh, thank you! What's going on?
Serve the ball, chump!
That's Phoebe! Where did you get that?
It's coming from the living room.
It's my New Year's resolution!
Y'know...go! Go! Right there!
Rachel, what're you gonna say to him?
That's because I'm in front of them.
Okay! Oh my God, thank you!!
Wow! That guy is so rude!
Oh, they-they sent me home.
No. He's not a horrible guy.
They won't take you to the vet.
So I got it when I was 13...
Ross, I can't believe you'd do that!
Okay, here comes another camera.
I don't have her number, butt-munch.
Well Phoebe doesn't eat turkey...
Who are they killing off?
I think I hear curtains closing...
What are you doing here so early?
Umm, can we see you ride it?
All right, I...I have to ask.
okay, Pheebs, theyre gone.
Would you stop staring at her?
OK. Just for a little while.
Chandler, you're not gonna die alone.
Weeeell, it's rum, and-
Hey Ross. What's up bro?
It's kind of an important one!
It's actually going to be just family.
Okay, he's a senior in college.
No, that landed in your food!
It's gonna be a problem, isn't it?
Rach, come see who's out here!
Mmh... this cake is amazing!
Maybe he didn't give you a chance.
Damn it! Rookie mistake!
Oh. Maybe they're- napping.
Oh, I'm sorry, mrs Hannigan.
The pink one with the flowers?!
Chandler, I'm gonna die a virgin!
Really? My God, he's really cute.
I knew you were not okay with that.
They thought Joey was a child?
Okay, let's talk about something else.
Oh, look at these little bunnies!
What do you do with your money now?
I'm sorry, I'll give it back to you.
Electrical plans for the building.
Rachel, the cute doctors are here.
"I'm a little bit country"...
Rach, he's a friend of ours.
Y'know which one was she again?
You were going to cut me out?
All right, I'll see you guys later.
Okay that does sound like fun.
Tell me about yourself, Zack!
How's the big anniversary dinner?
I do, but Rachel borrowed them.
No-no! Don't do it! Don't!
Here, take a couple of these.
Oh, I love it! Thank you so much!
Oh my God. He threw up?
As much as they love you?
Friday's perfect...She can't wait.
So how's it going with you guys?
Whoa!!! Are you kidding me?!
Joey's gonna be *so* upset.
Phoebe, come on, you have to tell us.
Yes! And that would be a shut-down!
Oh sweetie, I'm so proud of you!
It is not over! You're over!
Shoot! We're out of soda.
Yes, but you are dead inside.
Wait, did you know it was twins?
I can't be fair. You're my boyfriend.
Come on! It wasn't that bad!
I know, I just thought it would be fun.
Yeah, what, do you think we're stupid?
Ahh, Phoebe, I'm gonna miss you!
Oop, your cake is ready!
Nobody cares about the Dakotas.
Well there's not much we can do.
I wanna watch Entertainment Tonight.
Will! From high school.
That's sweet. Drink your hair.
It's nice to meet you. Janine...?
Ross, cough drops, please?
Chandler! Phoebe's hogging the game!
Okay, Phoebe you know what you're doing right?
Yes, I did! And you are welcome!
In 1981 you were 13!
Hey, Rach, did you make your money?
I just wanted to see how it's going.
Oh my God! It's like one mind.
You're mother killed herself!
I'll meet you there in two minutes.
My parents will be so happy.
No! Rachel is meeting us here.
We are on a roll, people!!
I have no idea what you just said.
Phoebe, can I talk to you for a second?
Oh that's sweet. Don't touch me.
Then all your stuff would be here.
Yes!! Yes! Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Come on! I really need your help!
That's Will from high school!
Chandler? Can you give me a hand?
I know.. it's gonna be really hard.
Really? I only had two glasses.
No, you were right. I don't have a plan.
That's it big girl! Come on!
Hey honey! I missed you today!
Did I squeeze it too hard?
No, you are not. We tell you stuff.
So what did you do today Pete?
Oh, but wait I do have a globe.
So, is Joey gonna stop snoring?
Your a poet and don't know it.
What are you talking about? What wedding?
Well do something! Get in there!
Yeah, that'd be great! Thank you!
I just thought he was nice, y'know?
All right, what about the third guy?
Pulling what? It's second down.
Isn't he an architect now?
Oh, you're breaking up with Tony?
Well, why would she lie to you?
Would it really have been that easy?
I'm just trying to spice it up!
What do you think brought than on?
So, are you sorry that I told them?
Hi, Dad, what are you doing here?
You wanna fool around with Joey?
Do you know what's a bad idea?
Rach! It's me! Pick up!
No, it's more like a good luck.
Chandler's making his sex face.
Wait! Oh my God! I can't get out!
I make the decisions, and I say no.
I gave you a key for emergencies!
Oh-ho, look what I got Julio.
007 has a fancy car!
Oh good, I think so too. Pheebs?
We are not friends with Phoebe anymore.
No-no-no! We need something old!
Oh my God Phoebe, you're on fire!
Good. And Rachel Green too.
Rachel, get the book! The book!
That's it. That's my worse Thanksgiving.
Seriously, what is this supposed to mean?
I'm sure they'll be here soon.
What?! You're going out with her again!
Did they just kill off Joey?
Oh, I was hoping you wouldn't remember.
Phoebe! Put that cigarette out!
Maybe I do! I'm pretty feisty!
I thought you were going out with Elizabeth.
Never call me from that phone.
So to get this part you can't be?
Oh my God! You're water broke!
Why is this car in my bedroom?
Oh my God Chandler! I can't believe it!
I know! Hey, how's Chandler doin'?
Stop it!! That's not funny!!
Umm, and looking at people differently.
Why would they think they're invited?
Phoebe, you have to lift it and point.
I have some pretty exciting news!
Here you go. You can wear this.
I don't need a tissue! I'm fine-d!
I swear you said you had the keys.
Which one was Pete Carney?
Hey, you touch that and you will be sorry.
Oh my God, are you out of a job?
No leg-chewing for us sir.
A tiny salt shaker!!!
: Hi, how was your flight?
Well, no. You're Chandler. Y'know, Chandler!
Yeah. What d'you wanna do tonight?
I hope Ross isn't too upset.
Oh, and the newspaper delivery guy.
I was just waiting for the perfect guy.
C'mon guys, it'll be fun!
That bastard taped over me!
You were my first kiss ever?
She's leaving for three months.
Ross, I'm gonna use yours, okay?
I need to borrow a hundred bucks.
Phoebe, you were supposed to take that back!
It's kind of a package deal!
You're gonna do some feet flirtin'!
Why? What did you do in the bathroom?
You don't want to know what tonight was.
No, I just I think that it's too soon.
We're gonna see each other naked.
Guys, you got your hair cut.
Aww, thank you. Uh Rach?
Okay, good! Okay, what do I want now?
Fine. She's wearing my bra!
Chicken Soup for the Soul?
Hey! How'd the audition go?!
Chicken? I could eat some chicken.
Oh, did you do a picture of Emma?
Actually, I was gonna do them jullienne.
Well, why don't we just bunny up.
All right, let's go say good-bye.
You still have feelings for me don't you?
What happened in Atlantic City?!
Hey! How did it go with Elizabeth?
Boy, do I have a surprise for you!
OK, try this salmon mousse.
What?! I-I-I don't, I don't do that!
Okay, well, stop staring at them.
I just had the most amazing bath.
Oh God, I am so sorry honey...
This doesn't mean anything, does it?
And you know what? We want a rematch.
I sure do! And you don't get one!
Does he not make enough money?
I'm sorry, but that's my happy place.
Well, how bout just her mom?
Oh wait! Stop! Stop! Stop!
Our guy's a great dancer!
I hate men! I hate men!
WE'RE GETTING A BABY!
Hey, Joey's ass! What are you doing?
Come here, I want to show you something!
Ok, well, what kind of ritual?
I wanna say good-bye at the car!
They won't be ready for weeks.
Haven't you and I covered that topic?
I know! I know, I'm so sorry for you!
God, I feel so guilty about Ross.
So, Phoebe runs weird huh?
I was probably waiting for it to open.
Why don't you go see Dr. Gettleman?
Ohh. And I don't even have a date.
What does she mean by 'involved'?
Y'know what? I'll think you'll play.
Yeah, but that's pigs not people!
What? Something happened with the plates?
I wish all guys could be like him.
I don't get older. I just get better!
Oh wow! Okay. Well that was fun.
So, Chandler, who's on your list?
You can't be a lawyer. You're eight.
Y'know, the possible side affects.
Oh dad, really you don't need to...
We don't, we don't wrestle now.
Hey, Joey, could you pass the cheese?
Well, are you just hanging out with Ross?
Ready for your birthday lunch?
DON'T...be too long with the phone.
Well, the club lost it's power.
I'm sorry that I borrowed your gloves
I know, but you have to open it today!
I think you're better than you think you are.
Do you not remember the puppet guy?
I am good. I finished my book.
Chandler? Do you promise to be good?
I was trying to help out a squirrel.
OK, what're we gonna do about this?
You were just being so nice to him!
Oh. I'm sorry it didn't work out.
Okay, now we just need something borrowed!
Joey!! What the hell were you doing?!
Helloooo? Yeah. Oh my God. Thanks.
But, I put some honey in it.
Ohhh, Chandler, sorry! Hey, Janice.
Heads! No, Tails! He-he-heads!
5 6 7 8!
I won't know what I would do without you.
He didn't ask me to marry him.
Chasing him all around the room?
You've got to be smooth about it.
Oh my God!!! What are you doing?!!
Uh, you left out the stupid part.
Wait! Wait! This isn't take-out!
I guess you have forgotten all about Joey?
I had to go with the odds Rach.
No he went out to get pizza.
Y'know what?! I gotta go! Ugh!
Okay, you're-you're really freaking me out.
What kinda things have you been saying?
Is your tongue swelling up?
Shrill?! The wedding is back on!
Son of a gun, it is!
Umm, she Rach, not it, she.
All right, I definitely taste nutmeg.
Oh nothing I'm just-just was yawning.
It's in the kitchen, I'll go get it.
Well, it's like that. With feelings.
Oh my God. She's gonna pick us!
Oh my God, I wrecked your baby!!
Okay, if it means that much to you...
So you talked to your dad, huh.
Well, I just caught the live show.
Okay! My turn! My turn!
Phyllis sees what I'm doing.
How would I know? I-I wasn't here.
God! If you're gonna cry about it!
Ahh! Aren't you dressed yet?
I don't think mine likes me either.
Hey Phoebe, will you give me a hand?
You got a callback too didn't you?
Making her a mixed tape?
You're the best friend I ever had.
Is he not cute enough for you?
You're a pig. And you can't do this.
No, we're not! We're not leaving!
Wouldn't you love to do it just once?!
Didn't she walk with a cane?
Hey, how long are you in the city?
You broke a little girl's leg?!!
Seriously, where did you get the hat?
Yeah. Which one do you like more?
How long has it been this time?
I guess. Why? Who's she with?
Stop it, stop it, stop it!
What?! You can't-what did you tell her?
No-no. Nothing wrong about that.
Alright. My job here is done.
There you go, enjoy your coffee.
Oh God, you fell off the wagon.
Well umm, Alexandra has been...
You did? What was he talking about?
Do you always have to bring him here?
There it is. Joey, what are you doing?
I know. Where do you wanna go eat?
Alright, well I'm tearing the lettuce.
Is your team winning hon?
Yes! You are so smart! I love you.
That's not true, you don't have a moustache.
Hey! My first review is out!
Oh, just until the glue dries.
I'll help you fix your sweater.
Y'know all my friends think this is weird.
That really was some of your best work.
This is a boy, and that's a girl.
So the going for help went well?
Hi. Do you know what time it is?
Yeah well, I ran into Richard.
Whatever you decide, whatever you do.
Oh! Do you need me to go with you?
Ugh! Well, y'know, we were away...
Alright, what was this sentence originally?
No, you said the baby creeps you out.
OK, I'll see you later babe.
So Ross, are you gonna bring Mona?
Please tell me you're stopping now.
So? What do you think of the house?
Is that a secret or a lie.
Oh good, I hate it when you do that.
No! Chandler and I are moving in together!
Thank God! I can't watch him anymore!
Nah... not-not special enough.
I didn't think you could keep it a secret.
Ethan, it's um... it's icky.
Ohh, you're about to get a little luckier.
Oh, right! I completely forgot about that.
Joey, where are the Jell-o shots?
This is kind of a classy place.
You can spill. In the sink.
Oh my God, Mike was gonna propose?
You didn't tell anybody I was did you?!
Oh my God! Oh my God! You have to go!
Weren't you asked to leave sonny?
It doesn't go with any of my stuff.
Yes it has! I made cookies!
And Mindy, your maid of...?
Nah, he doesn't do anything for me.
Fine, I'll rub it on myself.
Why can't you use the phone in here?
Please.. please, we are so close.
What are peanut butter fingers?!
God, look what I found in the drain.
You gotta help me out here Pheebs.
Ah, so glad you decided to come.
Did you know I was allergic to shellfish?
So it's okay to date a student.
OK, here you go. Good luck.
Five more and I'll flash you.
Me neither! We have to get in!
Can you go any faster with that?
Oh God! What did I just step on?
Come in. I've been waiting for you.
It's just, I'm not good at singing.
Ok. Hey, why don't you ask Richard?
You kissed a guy?!! Oh my God.
So? Do you think we should get it?
I don't know who I'm happiest for...
Oh, Candy! She was so spunky!
Joey... we always know what you mean.
Just waiting for it to stop bubbling.
Hello? Eighth street deli?
Wait! Joey! Joey! Are you okay?!
Rachel! That was a library card!
What, that little thing at the prom?
Honey, you're not pathetic, you're sad.
No, I called him. It's not gonna happen.
'Slim Pickings'...That is so cheesy.
The Luisa from home room!
Joey, Chandler knows I borrowed the money.
We're kidding. C'mon, tell us!
Right there! That was so fake!
Why, do you write him a lot?
Hey, the man's dog just died.
"Willing to adopt triplets?" No!
Okay, just get a lot better. Fast.
Promise to call me when you land.
Well, you used to like playing the guitar.
Do you want our guy to be your guy?
Where you can make out with your assistant.
Seriously, you don't think we should tell him?
We were just waxing our legs.
Oh, yay. Ok about that two.
You're jealous of Princess Caroline?
Oh yeah, picked a guy, 37135.
Oh stop it. Joey already told me.
We'll discuss it, in the morning!
I know!!! My erection is back!
Chandler, you don't believe in soul mates?
Tea gives Phoebe the trots.
I'm checking out the restaurant with Pete.
Careful. Careful. CAREFUL! Sorry.
Hey everybody! It's Fun Bobby!
Phoebe, I thought you said you know what you're doing?
You didn't even take off your pants.
Kinda like your Barca lounger.
Demi Moore is not a he.
Ok everybody, it's time for flan.
Hi. I'll be ready in just a second.
Hey, I could've had you if I wanted you.
I don't know, Chandler. Let's take a look.
They just gonna love you, just be yourself.
Did you like learn about her family?
What are you doing here? You can't be here!
Oh. Big family dinner tonight?
Thank you. Just make yourself comfortable.
Wow. That is not a happy hi.
I can't believe Phoebe's gonna have her babies!
What-what was it you were gonna tell us?
Everyone at our school heard it!
Sure, what? Ok, ok. Music?
Are you gonna dress up as Santa?
Oh, then it must've been you. Bye.
Anyway, how did it go with Kate?
Well, actually, I'm already seeing someone.
No, I don't think it ever works. Why?
Why? Do you have a report due?
Gunther, can I get a coffee to go?
Oh my God! You don't know me at all!
No, don't say it! Don't even think it!
You went out with Wallis Pincer?
Don't you want to look through the rest?
Really? I'd say 3 to 4.
About that? Erm...I'm going to change.
Do you wanna come in for some lemonade?
Have you even had a girl up here?
You read comic books right?
Yeah, I know. He can get really competitive.
Is there? Is there someone else?
I'll put a pillowcase over my head.
Chandler, wh-why don't we sit down?
Strip Happy Days Game?
I thought you said you were going to do nothing.
All you had to do was buy the card!
Why don't we just find a place for it?
What?!! You cannot tell him that!!
Great, now he's waving back.
A love scene? With who?
That's ok. I'm sorry I poisoned you.
Honey why don't you go lie down.
We do not have one of those signs.
But no. Maybe if I were baking.
Heyyy!! You got the door open!!
Joke. Joke. Blah! Blah!
That's different! I was drunk and stupid!
Wow! A lipper from Chipper.
Okay well I think...that's your answer.
Have you guys picked a date yet?
Oh my God! Have you lost your mind?
Rach, why won't they take it back?
Okay, come on, do it one more time!
Nice! Wow Phoebe you are good!
Okay. Can you give me a little push?
Hey Joey, I don't think we can use this.
Ehm, we were friends in 1992.
Me going out with Richard's son.
I guess they're back from their date.
And they weren't looking at you before?!
All right, look I'm just gonna unplug it.
GET OUT YOU DUFUS!!
Breathe, breathe, breathe... Good.
Y'know what, I'm gonna hold her head.
Hey, look at you! Where have you been?
Because Chandler still has feelings for you!
Come on, we can't let them win!
Honey, cover it up with the boat!
Shoot, I think I got mayonaise on you.
Rachel, things can get incredibly complicated.
I mean, that's a typical guy response.
Who? Two divorces and Joey?!
It's the heat. And-and the humidity.
Oh, gosh, you got some on your shirt.
It's just a little bit more, honey.
Well, we could start trying. Now.
I thought I was something that we both wanted!
Okay, so Ross will be doing the reading.
It's.. It's just so pretty and white.
Okay, okay... Chandler you... you stop it!
Do you wanna do it at the same time?
Ross they're really, really, really white.
Rach, are you really gonna let him do this?
It's enough for wedding scenario eight.
So this is it, we're really gonna adopt?
Why won't I be married when I'm 40?
You still want to move in together right?
Sorry. So how's it going with Joey?
So ah, Phoebe, how was your date?
We're-we're really sorry we fogged you.
Well we... we kinda broke up.
Hey, check me out, I'm a slut!
Hello, people who do not live here.
Yeah! And I got it on sale, too.
Did he just say 'Monica bang'?
He said he's really gonna miss you guys.
I'm sorry, I don't understand what you just said.
Well, Ross was mugged as a kid.
Because we won our apartment back!
Is it okay for me to come in now?
Hang on a second I just got in.
Okay everybody, let's go! Let's go!
Rachel!! Come on! Let me in!
But I thought if you left, you get fired.
How do you know she's gonna start talking?
Yeah, let-let-let's pretend that's not true.
Uh-huh, what exactly did you ask her?
Okay, I just don't get why you like it so much.
And yet, we're still poking him.
All right everybody, this turkey is ready!
Plus, everyone's gonna see your thing.
Ross, I hated you when we were kids.
Like only if the queen comes?
Wait! You're supposed to wear a costume!
What about when I started dating Chandler?
Hello? Hold on. It's your boss.
Have you ever taken out the trash?
I know. How could we have let this happen?
I'm just so glad you got to see the babies.
So, wait, you really did like my cookies?
Oh, I love my life, I love my life!
Chandler! He's seven; he's not stupid.
Boy, you are really not a morning person.
I can't believe he's that upset about this...
Good. What made you change your mind?
Uh, good hands. Healing hands.
Rach, does this have nonfat milk?
Okay, okay... Okay, I feel a little better.
Oh, thank you. Would you like a tour?
If I tell you, you'll think I'm crazy.
Well, we appreciate anything you can tell us.
Wait, now so you joined the gym?
I can't answer that! Chandler's my husband.
Okay, knock yourself out, Larry.
And yet, here we are doing it again.
Please, just a little bit off the back.
Say good-bye to sore muscles!
There are no tickets on the nightstand!
Thanks. So, I guess I better be going.
So, I guess you're next. You're ready?
Janice, what umm, what are you doing here?
Hmm, a little relieved, I gotta say.
So you're moving in with him. What happened?
They really were pretty, weren't they?
Rachel, he like, totally changed time.
Hey, come on, Phoebe, you understand don't you?
I guess Joey was right, it does nothing.
Come in! Come in! We're engaged!!!
Are you freaking kidding me, Green?
What did you do to his sweater vests?
Can you just hold on for one minute?
Eh, we weren't that close anyway!
Welcome to our side of the tunnel.
Aw, sometimes. Always, actually.
Yeah, we had a great time, thank you!
We were shopping, and we had lunch.
So Chandler, I guess I'll see you at dinner.
Home is Home Star stew.
I'm sorry that I made you stop seeing him.
I don't believe in soul mates either.
No-no-no, wait! We need something old!
Yes but my mom got me this job.
Are you saying that you don't wanna get with this?
Y'know you're really not supposed to be back here!
Again. Y'know what? I think we all did.
Ross, she's 25 years old.
: I'm gonna go freshen up ok.
You're right. I'm sorry. I should've told you.
Who do you wanna fool around with?
Looks like he's playin' baseball.
Oh no! You weren't supposed to see this!
Umm, do you have any uhh, moves?
Please! I made this game what it is.
Shut up!! It just got interesting!
Oh God, you are about to get sooo lucky.
We'll just...we'll just let her stay.
That is so funny. Let me see that.
What the hell is that dog doing here?!
Carol moved her stuff out today.
And so, we're hiding in the bathroom.
And lucky means, more cleavage?
Did you eat all the neighbor candy?!
Nothing, I just heard something nice about you.
She sent the chicken back again?!
Yeah, like you're gonna be pregnant. I mean pregnant.
That cold makes you sound so great.
Chandler, please, come on. Look at him.
Oh, that's what I would do, forget mine.
It-it's so great to see you both here.
Rach, Phoebe hates Pottery Barn.
There was just one woman, wasn't there?
That, you get? That, you get?
Cassie needs to stay at your place.
Richard buzzed. He's waiting downstairs.
Joey, what are you gonna do when you have a baby?
You want a problem? I'll give you a problem!
And the fact that they're both monkeys.
Chandler has two copies of Annie!
I'm so sorry. Please, stop freaking out.
Wait a minute, y'know, you're bringing me!
You seriously changed your name to that?
Oh! They're late and they're sloppy!
Honey? Is that something you're making up?
Phoebe, she sounded pretty upset to me.
Well good, here let me help you out.
So, you wore your nightie to dinner?
Okay, d'y'see anybody you think could be me?
That's right baby! Okay, what do I want now?
Oh, god, I am so spoiled... That's it!
Are you funny? Tell us a joke!
My God! Is this a gym card?
People! People say it! Come here!
That's not your regular dry cleaners.
Y'know what, you can play with my dollhouse.
Oh my God yes! Who is she?
You bet! No TV or anything!
Oh that's an eye removal machine.
He- he pooped in my shoe.
We weren't picking up, it's Amanda!
He is the man in the black dress.
Does anybody wanna split this with me?
Damn it, I did not think this through!
It's umm, it has something to do with transponding.
Good, they feel good, in my head.
Oh good, I'm glad that's catching on.
Y'know those are a delicacy in India.
Okay! Oh God, y'know what? It's really bad.
Yeah! Joey has the best boyfriend ever!
Freemont. West-Westmont, ah Westburg?
Grand Supreme Little Darling?
Well umm, Chandler and I are moving in together.
Fair enough, now go get ready!
No, although now that's what I'm thinking.
Hey. Call me when you get there. Okay?
But then how do we know who wins?
Wait-wait, go back to that sibling thing.
Look, I- I could go on pretending-
What if he reads it in the paper?
Don't you see? It's the perfect crime!
What do you mean "what do we do"?
Maybe we should just tell your parents first.
If Phoebe were my maid of honor...
Joey, that paper's like a year old!
Shut up! This place is a hole!
So, we're just four losers... SUPER!
If the school finds out you're fired.
Because they'll know we've been listening.
God, I'm sorry! I'll go back and get it!
You said you loved me! I can't believe this!
Because she's not gonna get to keep the babies.
Wow! Uh what, did he uh, say?
They're kissing let's just go around them.
These aren't for you! Are you upset?
I know. It's just such reckless spending.
Fun? Fun, you think this is fun?
You mean you know Paul like I know Paul?
Ok fine. I'll handle this. Phoebe?
Come on, she'll be here any minute.
Just figured, 'cause you and Ross are...
Stop sending food to our apartment.
Is-is-is there a-a Mrs. Stevens?
You made a joke right? So I laughed.
Did the girl ever let you ride it?
She's my favorite character on DOOL.
Umm, I-I really don't want to tell this story.
And a lot could still get in our way.
Nice try; I'm keeping the boots.
Umm, listen there's something I think you should know.
All right, all right, at least I'm prepared.
So maybe we should just. . .
How many kids were we gonna have?
Oh my God! He's gonna rat me out!
Yeah-yeah, you remember how I call you bunny?
It's okay honey, you'll find a name.
Yes Rachel, why do you care so much?
Well I-I really don't remember the name of it.
No, only because that's the graduation song.
Have you seen Rachel? Or a mirror?
Well, what made you make the exception for me?
It's out on the island. It's in Massapequa.
Newark airport. Why, where are you?
But I thought you wanted to live by yourself.
Is it the same thing that Chandler had?
Where is the James Taylor CD?
Y'know what, let's do the catering business.
Wow! It's like Rachel in High School.
Let go! I'm a tiny little woman!!
Who is also in charge of purchasing.
Oh my God! Where the hell have you been?!!
Please! I am not as bad as Ross.
I can't believe you're not gonna be here for Christmas.
I mean I-I don't I think I have enough quarters.
I knew you were likely to take a wife!
I just can't stand you being here all the time.
Call them mom and dad you loser!
Then get over yourself! Grow up!
Yeah you're right. I don't know what I was thinking.
You know the words! You are so into this!
All right, we'll call you when we get back.
Yeah could-could-could you get me something to drink?
And she wants to go hunting, too!!
Hey, you just got in 5 minutes ago!
We heard about your pants, I'm so sorry.
yeah oh my god, I'm so moved.
Oh my God, ice just got in my eye!
My boyfriend really does have good taste!
She is unbelievable, our mother is...
Making holiday candy for the neighbors.
Noo! I'll stay. He's my brother.
I know you do. Me too. So what now?
You know what? I-I think I'll wait out here.
Yeah, they do seem to feel pretty bad.
So we can be friends who sleep together.
So what? Don't you have any will power?
Alright, we're gonna have to unscrew the chain.
Hey-hey-hey. You wanna hear something that sucks.
I don't remember. Do you wanna take a walk?
Can we just start throwing things in?
Well I didn't want everyone to think I was stupid.
This is just Bactine. It won't hurt.
Oh, um, I don't know if that's a good idea.
Oh, wait a minute! Who's is the father?!
You were my Midnight Mystery Kisser?
Oh, so there is gonna be a fifth date?
Only if you say his full name.
Have you ever been to one of my weddings?
Do you mind telling us what it is?
I LOVE MY NEW JOB!
Okay Phoebe, we should probably go back now.
Relax. Y'know, she may not even know.
So Joey, why didn't you grow a moustache?
You got the job?! Why didn't you tell me?
: how do you know I have one of those?
At least you took me down with you!
Not one that can pee on the roof.
Honey, I just don't think that you understood the joke.
I proposed to Chandler! Alright, moving on...
So then, are you going to dump Jason?
Hey! How'd your date go with Jake?
Awww, come on-wait-stop it. Okay, to Monica.
I don't know. Maybe we're some kinda magnets.
No. Not after what happened with Steve.
Oh my God, he's beautiful. Thank you so much.
Y'know what, champ? I think I'll pass.
Oh my God! What were you doing in a library?
Oh, hey! Oh good, you brought food!
: But you don't remember sleeping with her.
Yeah, a lot. A lot, a lot!
Here you go! What do you think about centerpieces?
I'm parked in a garage on Morton!
Harder than it sounds. Isn't it?
Yeah, apparently, they're pretty good seats.
What about the part where he has rabies?
I don't know how any of these got opened?!
See ya.... Waitwait, what's with you?
Okay. Does it have to do with Ross and Rachel?
Can you hear me say "You're grounded"?
When, when did-how, how did you...
Ok, how about pilgrim Mockolate mousse?
What about these? These look the same?
Uhh, not much. Uh, work's good.
I've gotta tell you, Bob is terrific.
It's no big deal, I do it all the time.
Oh, thank god! Emma, there you are!
It's so unfair, you don't even like your job!
Rachel is not going to pick your stupid guy.
No, too late. You can't give it back!
So, um, how-how did you guys meet?
Do you really want to pull at that thread?
This is Chandler's chicken. This is the turkey.
Oh, George, baby, drop the towel!
Yes Phoebe, but this is all I have. Okay?
Oh yeah! What was his superpower again?
Thank you. My hair is very amused.
Yes... What is the end of that sentence?
Alright. Just keep him away from me.
: Ok This is how much I love you.
So umm, how was your date with Ginger?
Actually, I'm gonna go check on the twins.
You have scratches all over you, what happened?
Shut up, and put my table back.
Why? 'Cause otherwise you'd go for it?
She looks exactly like Aunt Marilyn.
Only if I don't have to get up and sing.
Is it something you'd be interested in?
Sure, we have no money, go ahead.
Yeah, uh, it's actually not that big a deal.
What?! There's only been like four kids.
Oh, my fiancee wants the Swing Kings.
It was Michelle. It was definitely Michelle.
Well, I think I shouldn't look directly at them.
Hi Dad! I can still call you that right?
All the time. In fact, I was undefeated.
It's okay. I don't care. It's uh, it's fine.
Hey! What did you decide to do about the movie?
Joey just hired Chandler to be his assistant!
Wha... How the hell is that gonna help?
Well, I thought that I would cut up the tomatos.
Yeah, you miss alot, when you're moo-ing.
Are you gonna be ok, officer, uhm,...
Oh good, Lenny and Squigy are here.
My turn? What-what are you talking about?
People have got to finish their stories!
I'm dicing, I'm dicing, I don't hear anything.
Would you ever be a surrogate for anyone?
No because it-it didn't seem important.
No Joey, I think he's just watchin' TV.
Because I don't work at the Szechwan Dragon.
Chandler! Chandler! I just figured out who you are!
How much did ever really win before?
Look at you, you won't even look at him.
What happened to Santa, Holiday Armadillo?
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.
I guess I wanted to keep it as a souvenir.
So basically, this is a getting-rid-of-everything-Rachel-ever-used sale.
There is no alley behind Macy's.
Okay, where is the Kat Stevens CD?
Well, that's it You gonna crash on the couch?
Wow, those pills really worked, huh?
A monkey. Have you seen a monkey?
Chandler stole a twenty from my purse!
So, you think you'll do it on his couch?
Is that some kind of boat talk?
How did it go with Frank and Alice?
Still, I was quick as a cat.
Ross, you've got to do something about the humping.
Yeah, I saw him waiting for an elevator.
I'm sorry, Joey. I'm gonna go to bed, guys.
Hi. Richard just told me he loves me.
Noooo! I'm lying. I am so drunk.
Hey, Rachel, Can-can I see you for a sec?
Hey! You smell like perfume and cigarettes.
I can't believe you guys are actually getting tattoos.
Heads up Ross! Score! You suck!
Hey Rach, aren't these candlesticks mine?
Gotcha. When do we tell them about this?
So this is what a stroke feels like.
So are you ever gonna tell whoever it is?
That's right, because I forbid you to smoke again.
Well I don't have them either. Where are they?
And! We also have speaker phone.
Well, high school was not my favourite time.
Ross, if you don't tell them, then I will!
People are supposed to wanna hang out here!
No. But I remember people telling me about it.
I'm sorry I almost made you sleep with Ross.
Well, not... worried, just... wondering.
She and Phoebe took the stripper to the hospital.
Got the keys? or Got the keys!
Hey, you think, you can keep it another night?
Hey, Joey, what would you do if you were omnipotent?
Yeah! Yeah! His name is Chandler and...
Well at least, I'm going to mute it.
Well, go over to her! She's not with anyone.
Oh, no thanks, we're just here to observe.
Oh, y'know what, I can't, it really kills.
yep, that's me, I am that stupid .
How many fingers am I holding up?
Could've played Monopoly, but nooooo.
..I dunno, a little too Alan?
Let's see, today's Monday... Never.
So, do you want me to watch Ben for you?
No! But I know exactly what I'm going to say.
Okay! Okay! Make me sterile, but okay.
Oh God, maybe he won't see us. Richard!
Yes it is! You saw me wearing it!
But, we pick again! We pick again!
Shhh! We just got her to go to sleep.
All I have is, is oregano and a Fresca.
Oh no, was I cleaning in my sleep again?
Or "Win, Lose or Draw".
Listen, I... I don't think this is the best time.
Richard's living room, drinking wine.
I swear, if you try it, you will love it!
You can not play bagpipes at the wedding!!
Joey, this is for you. It's blackberry curin.
Why, what's wrong with my bathroom floor?
Was he falsely accused of something?
Yeah, I tried to gnaw myself free.
I promise you, he would definitely want you back.
Oh look, and he did my crossword puzzle.
So you gave in and decided to call someone?
A hat! Yes! We need a hat.
Is he crazy?! You just had Ross's baby!
Chandler, you have to tell Joey that you're not in Tulsa.
Oh my God! Fog him! Fog him!
Oh please, you just want more blue pins.
I'm really getting tired of sneaking around.
Do you want to go out on a date with her?
That'll teach you to lick my muffin.
Hey, Rachel, isn't that stuff almost pure...
Oh yes! I have it right here, on ice!
Dad, Chandler was just laughing at your joke.
Okay, look at this one. This is my favourite.
Oh gosh, Phoebe, I think I caught your cold.
Oh, sweetie. Oh, look at you. You're shivering.
I hear ya. Excuse me for just a second!
Honey you-you got to beat your scores!
Oh, it is sooo perfect. Thank you so much.
Uh, Rach, it's the Visa card people.
Bet I know how that discussion's going to go.
Yes, I would like something. No, no thank you.
Oh my God! I have nothing left to teach you!
Can you believe he just offered me a restaurant?
I know the code to his answering machine.
Yes you did. You absolutely sold me...
Uh, look, officer... uhm Sir...
Okay. Well, it's good news. It's good news.
We could, or we can have sex in it.
Oh. Well did you get it? Let me see.
There's an ad for a naked chef?
Blow drying what, you have no hair.
How about a Youhoo with a funny straw?
Oh no! Did you take my bra too?!
No, I-I haven't seen your pink shirt.
Yes you did! You did like a little hop.
And I'm a wuss. And we should be partners.
Oh, please, that is such a lame excuse!
Didn't your dad used to call you Pumpkin?
How about at a game, on the big screen?
Phoebe, why is there a dog in our apartment?
Look, you and I went to different high schools...
Wow, do you mean like kiss him-kiss him?
I have not been sick in over three years!
Check your numbers! Make me rich!
I knew that! Rachel! Use you're head!
Well, it just seems like a really small number.
Ross! He's playing with my spatulas again!
Hey wait a minute, this one isn't dirty.
Oh, you're totally welcome! What'd she say?
Hey, don't blame me for wigging tonight!
When it's your assistant, I would say never.
Then, I'd steer clear of Phoebe.
Hi. It is so, so nice to meet you.
Ethan, focus. How could you not tell me?
Oh, look at those little fingers and toes!
Oh Soap Opera Digest award!
You're not gonna believe this. Okay, so I go over...
Well, we're still talking about it, aren't we?
That's it! Right there! Is all I wanted!
Well, can't you just have the party when we get back?
All right. Honey, that's-that's a sleeve. Okay?
Well, usually when I'm this anxious, I clean!
Hey Chandler! Did you like the macaroni and cheese?
I'm sorry, why is this girl going to call me?
Yeah. I hope she can kick his ass.
If you're not going then I don't want to go either.
Well, the giraffe's okay. And so is the pirate.
Has somebody been drinking my fat?
Okay. Okay, I'm ready. Come on big fella!
Are you serious? You still see Dr. Gettleman?
Hey, we can take her back with you if you want.
What do you have against the beautiful guest room?
Nice to meet you! My God you're great!
My boyfriend said he didn't like my massages.
Phoebe, we are so proud of you! You're amazing!
No, I'll do it. You just stick to your job.
Y'know, I try to stay positive. . .
Great. So the ball is in his court?
Do you really see this as a long-term thing?
Sure, every time, you're such a princess...
Phoebe, you have a, a twig in your hair.
Oh, right, right. How was your date, 'Chand-lrr'?
I wanted it so bad! Wanna go pack?
Wait a minute. I thought last night was great.
Damnit Phoebe! How did you even call him?
Phoebe, he's gotta be in the room for that to work.
When Rachel was with Paulo, what did you do?
I don't know, I lost it all ok. I lost it.
Rach, there's something uh, important I have to tell you.
Hey, we're probably fertile, let's go home!
You know, that guy she met at the coffeehouse.
I'm still not done not wanting to talk to you.
Very good! What do you need it for anyway?
This is harder than I thought it would be.
What, what are you doing? You can't go out there.
Ohh, everybody at the restaurant still hates me.
Chandler, would you like some more orange juice?
Well y'know Joey, you're a pretty charming guy.
Man, I feel like I'm coming down with something.
Hey, at least I knew where my guy was.
You are insane! You-you gotta give this up!
We took a cab. Did you guys walk?
So we're gonna try? I mean, are we trying?
Still get a discount on wedding dresses?
You-you're gonna have to put your foot down?
The park huh? A public place.
Thank you. I think I just had a tiny orgasm.
OK, how does everybody like their burgers?
Oh, would you let it go already?! You're fine!
Hey, this afternoon you said you'd be supportive...
All right, Phoebe get open. Rachel, go long.
Have I read it? No, are you enjoying it?
Is this the one that I threw out last year?
Oh my god, honey, I'm so so so so so sorry.
What? Are you serious?! Joey smells gas!
Oh, thanks! We'll try to stop by.
Pick a number! That is your only job!
I've been great, just great. How have you been?
OK, if you say stop, then we stop.
He was so good in that movie of MacBeth.
Thank you for letting us see the house again.
Okay, stop it Phoebe, you're getting me all tingly.
Ooh, chocolates on the pillows! I love that!
Okay, let's go!! Let's hit the road!!
Ooh, candy bars, crossword puzzles...
You know what? Then, Joey, we want you to do it.
Because I put my head between her legs.
Come here. I can breath through my mouth.
Chandler one time wore my underwear to work!
Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't do this.
I don't want him to think that I'm having an affair.
Now I love you. And not just 'cause I have to.
Hey, it's Funny's cousin, Not Funny.
How does that laugh not give you a headache?
It's a traditional Mexican custard dessert.
Look, I wanted to tell I'm-I'm sorry you lost.
Four, please. I'm really nervous. Thank you.
You're not gonna be here New Year's Eve??
Ross, when's this comet thing start?
Hey! Maybe the monkey will be at the audition!
Oh, oh, okay umm, so I'll see you soon.
What are you guys doing? Oh my God, is that Richard?
We're really glad you decided to meet our guy.
Hey, it was very moving! You're just heartless!
Well I'm Monica Geller, ball like a baby.
All right, come on, I'm-I'm late for work!
Oh my God, Joey, that is such a great tip.
Is it better than the other salmon mousse?
I can cook and you can take care of the money.
Roger wants to take her out tomorrow night.
Ross, your little creatures got the remote again.
Because! You could get to live out my fantasy!
Hi Chandler. It's really nice to see you NOT.
Ok, it is definitely less than a ballpark.
That's true! I knew I married you for a reason!
Oh umm, I meant to tell you, Ross is coming.
Well, tonight was-was going to be my first time.
She doesn't have a stomach-ache. She's in labor!
It will not be fine. We'll get in trouble.
Ross! The neighbors ate all my candy!!
I mean think about all the money that you're gonna make!
So! I'm just an empty vase, huh?
Yeah, hi, it's Monica. I just got a page.
Oh yeah...So how did you end up kissing?
That's right, she came back all by herself.
Michael Flatley, Lord of the Dance!
Yeah, but y'know we could sneak in and watch.
Would you look at her? She is so peaceful.
If you tell me, I'll tell you what Phoebe said.
Chandler, I don't even wanna see the musical Oklahoma!
We don't do that! Tell her we don't do that!
Oh, wait, wait, wait! Here they go again.
All weekend? That's a whole lotta naked.
I didn't say your songs were not good enough.
Ross, how long have you been planning this wedding?
You only think it's stupid because you suck at it.
Oh, Janine, the really hot dancer girl?
Ok, three kinds of potatoes coming up.
Joey...he's not even thinking about going after Rachel!
The wedding is off, sloppy and immature!
Huh. What's doofus spelled backwards?
Well, then, I'm okay with being high maintenance.
Other wall, people! Other wall!
Hey! Umm, I think Brenda needs a raise.
This Thanksgiving kicks last Thanksgiving's ass!
Umm, okay. If it's a boy it's Daniel.
Yeah, I think I have some around here somewhere. Why?
Uhh, y'know actually I was gonna do some laundry.
Phoebe, there's a dog sitting on my couch!
Change! Okay, sit down. Two seconds.
Yeah! And the winner gets a hundred bucks.
Okay, umm, okay, umm... It's just Joey and Ross.
No, not if their room has two beds!
Well, what kind of food is he looking for?
I-I already told him everything! You shush!!
That's also like the tenth time you told us.
Oh my God! That's my restaurant, I'm the chef there.
What? So now I'm not allowed to fire him?
Danny. Are you guys ever gonna go out again?
Rachel, it's a world where Joey is a neuro-surgeon.
Why? Do you think he's still mad at us?
Oh no! You and Phoebe are gonna help me in here.
Boy, that was-that was, umm... terrific.
Guys. I thought you were taking Ross to the game?
Yeah, two hours, a lifetime that's the same.
Yeah you will! And, are you kiddin' me?!
That's different, we were roommates! And when?!
Wow! I can't believe I actually rolled an eight.
No!! You have been screwing us all day!
Oh God, is it 6:30? Buzz him in!
It's all everybody at the party could talk about!
No I didn't. I asked, "got the ke-eys?"
Base Unit! Think Monica! Think!
Phoebe! You kinda caught me at a bad time.
Stop with the broom, we're not making noise.
Child-birth, it's a natural thing! It's beautiful.
What is wrong with this freezer?! Ow! Ow!!
My parents spent the money for our wedding!
So what. So he drank a lot tonight.
It's a globe and, a pencil sharpener.
No! Joey, we swore we'd never tell!
Is he right? Am I really-Am I awful?
Oh, wait, is he the guy I met at Christmas?
: you don't think sharks are sexy do you?
Oh, I'm sorry. Shoot, they were doing it before.
Whose little ball of paper is this?!
Of course! Joey wouldn't let you have one?
Oh really? When? Do you wanna do it with me?
Okay. So what do you.... you think she's faking?
Gary's gonna ask you to move in with him!!
Well if you want a problem? I'll give you a problem!
Oh, about that. Joey, you have to change before the party.
Oh my god, where's Emma? Where's Emma?
Fresh cookies! Hot from the oven!
Hello? Hold on please. Joey, it's your mom.
All right, get your coat, we're going to the hospital.
Ross, you did not come up with "got milk?"
Phoebe, why is smoke coming out of the bathroom?!
No-no, Rachel, don't get it! He can't see us!
I know you're planning my surprise bridal shower.
Those are my eyes! Those are my breasts.
Oh my God! How cute is the on-call doctor?
Well, I guess we won't be warming his house.
Oh no, two days, you must be bummed.
Ohhh, ooohhh... you are on a roll, mister!
I think I'll help her out. What is going on here?
I'm sorry, I'm just excited about being an aunt!
We'd be eating our soup right now.
Hey! Didn't you have that outfit on last night?
That's it! Take it! Take it! Take it!
I think that is so great! When are you gonna ask her?
I haven't really settled on a spot yet!
So you stole that tape from Richard's apartment?
Oh good God, Ross! How the hell do you do it?
Wait a minute! My last Kit-Kat bar!
Oh wait, Joey, you can't go like that! You stink!
Sush!! I cannot believe she is still up there.
Oh no, she's out having drinks with Carl.
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god!
Yo, Bing. Racquetball in 15 minutes.
Ross you know that tonight is your date with Hillary?
Well, unless goose is a vegetable...ha haaaah!
I cannot believe you broke up with her just like that.
It's okay. Chandler, are you afraid of me or something?
Mm-mh. I printed them out on my computer.
Yes, they are. The Blymens invited them.
Wait a minute, I can get ice at the restaurant...
What if something gets broken, they're so expensive.
Yeah, yeah, and you were going him y'know, your flower.
So guys, listen, I go over there, and umm...
I mean, my feelings for Richard are certainly gone.
Yeah, but I'm the only one related by blood.
Oh. Monica! ...Hi. I'm Mo- ...nana.
Look. Joey, do you know we can see you from here?
Fantastic! I have one question: How is that possible?
Remember it? What do you think this is, a freckle?
Ya know, you had no right to go out with him.
Alright. I'm gonna go change, I've got a date.
I hadn't! Photo 152 was a prototype.
My God, you can't even look at me! Can you?
Well, her father pays you for baby-sitting right?
You know that? You don't want to spoil your appetite.
...horribly attractive. I'll be shutting up now.
This is the most special day of our lives.
Awww, look at Aunt Monica's little boy!
Yeah, I don't hear Chandler's and he doesn't hear mine.
Yeah you're right, we can't-we shouldn't watch this.
Besides, it takes the focus off the hat.
Wow, the boyfriend's parents! That's a big step.
Let's see, 1939... yeah, 24, 25?
It sure is nice to do this together, isn't it?
You know, it still smells like monkey in there.
Rache, I think we have enough regular lamps.
Hey, I've come to terms with it, you have to too.
Don't worry about it Phoebe, we'll absolutely do it.
Get up. Come on. Let's get some coffee.
I hope you cleaned your hair out of the drain.
I want you to know, it wasn't me who turned you in.
How did you know that?! Joey! Chandler!! It's time!
Oh, what are we gonna do! I don't wanna see her!!
O-kay, so you wanna play it that way, do you?
Ooh, are we allowed to lie in the vows?!
Oh, I was thinking about having people over for the game.
Oooh! They are in for a world of pain!
Y'know what? You're right Phoebe. You're right. Thank you!
You know what. Tomorrow I'm gonna do your clocks.
Hey Rach, could you get me some cough drops?
Joey, I thought you were gonna try to be friends first!
You mean the guy who kept calling you Ron?
I wanna wake up early and go get it for you!
Honey, I'm going to put my hand in your pocket!
You'd better hope I don't see you in the hallway!!
"To take you to his mansion in the sky-y?"
Phoebe, c'mere. I want to show you something in the bathroom.
No! We're gonna have fun. We can make fudge!
Oh damn the jellyfish. Damn all the jellyfish!
Sounds like she's got the ah, whole package.
No... Either of you girls got a quarter?
You jerk! You know how much I love that kid!
Well forget it! It doesn't hurt that baaad!!!!
Okay. Let us start with the A's. Advertising.
Hey. There you are. You disappeared after dinner.
No, Rachel never pees in public restrooms.
You're getting a crush on your sister's fiance.
Hey, are you ready to get back on the dance floor?
You've got to get back out there, it's your party.
: Yes! Chandler Watches Shark Porn!
Wow! I'm-I'm-I'm glad you smashed her watch!
All right, then show me some manly moves.
No. You know, sometimes just things doesn't work out.
Alright, Cincinnati, no blinds, everybody ante.
Because Armadillos also wandered in the desert?
I love the "I forgot the present" fake out!
That's the nicest anyone has ever said to me!
Well there's some people who do want to marry me.
That place in Vermont? You can take a hint!
That's my favourite kind! Okay, we are doing this!
Not a lot, Phoebe's kidding, Phoebe's crazy.
You know what? I'm not gonna be able to enjoy this.
We're supposed to meet my parents in 15 minutes.
What-what are you doing? Is this supposed to be funny?
Then why the hell are you dumping my brother?!?
You got a present for my parents. That's so sweet.
Chandler, that's like your fourth cup of coffee!
I'm Monica Geller. I've been taking care of you.
Y'know she has 147,000 pairs of boots...
Yes! Why, did you-you forget to make yours?
Did he give you that whole "You're-not-up-to-this" thing again?
Why are you talking about volcanoes all of the sudden?
Okay. God well, we gotta go back and get them!
I told you! I am not coming to a naked wedding!
Wow, he's really not letting this go, is he?
I know what you mean. You're like a sister to me too.
Quick, Phoebe, tell us before he can swallow.
Joey! He's working! You would look good in that.
Look Julio, someone left their book here.
Un, no you didn't! You must be mistaken!
Y'know what? I-I don't want a big, fancy wedding.
Yeah. You're just gonna have to stop pissing me off.
Oh I can't. Dr. Roger is coming over again.
Oh, I'm totally crazy, but you-you like the food?
Sweetie, we heard you crying. Please don't cry.
Chinese menu guy. Forgot the menus.
Hey, did you guys know, that your oven doesn't work?
Oh yeah, like I'm going to let you talk to the queen.
Okay! There you go! It's two tickets to Vegas!
Ross and I always wanted to be Donny and Marie.
Because Phoebe and Gary are in that-can't-keep-their-hands-off-each-other-doing-it-in-the-park phase!
It just makes more sense as an ensemble.
Chandler, do you think we talk about our relationship enough?
Okay. Right. Oh my God that is gonna be so hard.
That's not true, there are great pictures of us!
Did you ever, uh, like, think about the future?
Fine, so you don't like them. Everybody else does.
What are you talking about? We're all together right now.
How can I not do it? I have $127 in the bank.
Ohh! Fish, seaweed, a sunken ship.
Oh yeah, of course. I'm fine it's just that-
Yes I did, I'm Monica, Super Aunt.
Six? I just had it for one night. It's three.
Yeah, well you promised Barry, you'd marry him.
Yeah! That's why I'm sleeping with him on the side.
Oh, just so you know, you-you have to let him win.
They could be our neighbors, what are they like?
No! We only mess around at his place!
You don't mind me touching your belly, do you?
You bought the beach house when I was 23!
See yeah umm, you kinda stole my thunder!
Yeah, I couldn't be mad at him for too long.
I-I'm the head chef. I-I can't get promoted.
So, why don't you just take it back to where you got it?
All right, that's it, we're going to the emergency room.
I feel really sad that we're not...really there anymore.
I know! I'll tell you something, we are gonna do that again!
Yeah, Chandler... you've been there for five years.
No, no. It felt nice to acknowledge this.
Oh my God. You're even dumber than I am!
Damnit! Damnit!! Here's your fifty bucks!
I promise you, next time I will absolutely tell you.
You don't have a car. And your license expired.
But more importantly to full well-rounded lives.
Oh Will. But you-you've worked so hard...
It's okay! It's good! It's good. It's a disease!
Joey, why don't you put them in the lost and found?
Guys, you're a few steps ahead of us.
Oh I love taking limos when nobody died!
Hmm, I don't know. We really have to talk this through.
You go girl. I can't pull that off can I?
Yeah. Rach, are you thinking you're gonna make it to Vail?
Yeah, we named the boy Jack after dad.
Wow. Oh wow. You know I love you too, right.
Okay, so you were trying to play bad this whole time.
Dad, it is not. What's with the red light?
Yeah, because I hear the king is looking to adopt.
Hold on a second! What is that on her ankle?
Guys, please, I'm just gonna have dinner with him. Okay?
Oh, that is so sweet. Oh gosh, love you. Insurance?
I know! Phoebe is gonna love dressing them in these!
No, I want everything that you just said. I want a marriage.
Was he wearing a stunning blue suit?
I just told Rachel that Roy touched my boob.
I can't believe her, y'know it's just-it's so typical.
C'mon give me five more. Five more.
All right! You and me! Let's go! Right now!
You broke up with a girl because she was fat?!
Hey, how are you feelin'? Any morning sickness?
Ditch you? Phoebe, you were pregnant with the triplets!
Oh that's a great idea. You're really good on the phone.
Y'know, I love doing crossword puzzles with you honey!
Ah-ah-ah, now you started this, you will finish it.
Oh-oh, no no don't worry, I'm gonna wash it.
Whatever keeps you off the balcony, big guy!
Look, I am not high maintenance. I am not. Chandler!
Not that bad? Did you hear the hammer story?
Here, let me make the milk, I'm up anyway.
You're really sticking with the shell necklace huh?
Oh that's too bad. It's true, but too bad.
Don't get too attached, she's having it cremated.
Limited seating?! I am just one tiny person!
I meant, why don't you take Richard to the game? What?
I know, how can you not be accross the hall anymore.
Who's Gladys? Oh! What a tragic loss!
Oh my God Rach. Bean bag chairs.
Oh my God, what would have done if I said yes?
No, I think that this is what you wanna do, I think it's great!
And what are you laughing at, Miss `My-keg-sucking-boyfriend-is-stealing-from-me!'
Well, it's a set and they should probably stay together.
All right, just trying to start an interesting discussion.
Chris says they're closing down the bar.
Y'know, maybe it's best that we never got to do it again.
See, now this is why I keep notepads everywhere.
Alright, you know what? That's it. You've had your chance.
I don't know exactly. It's-it's sorta like wrestling.
No! Rachel, you didn't find anyone so you can't tell him.
I've never loved anybody as much as I love you.
Doing great, the quiches are coming along.
I don't want her to get a boob job! That's crazy!
'Cause I don't want to encourage this kind of behaviour.
It's some of Richard's hair! What do I do with this?
Rachel, you say you're sorry or your sweater gets it.
You know, it's a really funny story how this happened.
Rachel, it's going to happen. Chandler is gonna move in here.
Chandler! He's your father; he should be at the wedding.
No! You are not gonna run out and leave her here!
They tore it down a few days early.
He probably wants you back because you're right for the job.
Ohh, I'm sorry I couldn't think of anymore for Ross!
No, actually, we're buying the house next door.
No you learn these things. You grow into it.
Y'know, there's a Starbucks about three blocks down.
How about we play for more money, say 150?
...Oh! I-I see you moved the green ottoman.
So are you thinking of starting up something with this guy?
Oh, I can't. We're throwing Phoebe a bachelorette party.
Well Joey, we're all...we're all very proud of you.
I'm in love too! But in an orderly fashion.
All right then, your bra would still be big.
Oh, my goodness, they've all gotten so big!
I have you scheduled for nudity at 2300 hours.
Hey Frannie, welcome back! How was Florida?
Rachel, listen to your mother. She is very smart.
Oh, they're brochures from different adoption agencies.
I gotta tell ya, I think it's okay to be that guy.
Why does my cinamon stick have an eraser?
He's in a different room! He's really that loud?
You are so cute! How did you get to be so cute?
: Im very, very drunk right now.
You remember that video I found of mom and dad?
Uch. I am still so mad at you for smoking.
BECAUSE OF OUR MEDDLING! Alright?
Eh... Heart Disease, Alzheimers, gout?
Sweetie! Edges! Fingers! Smudgey! Pictures!
So, uh, have you ever thought about being there for her?
She was like 30, dark hair, attractive.
Are, are you okay? I mean, do you want me to stay?
Hey, Rach, can you give me a hand with this box?
Oh my God, what a fun day! That sounds great!
I can't believe mom and dad are selling the house!
I don't know. I guess the other people just don't care enough.
No, no, don't get it. Let the machine pick up.
We forgot to sign one of the admissions forms.
You said your boss wants to buy your baby?!
Well, you-you coulda just turned the cushion over.
All right, biggest suite in the place. Come on!
The game's over! Take off your robe!
It's unbelievable! I-I can't believe that sign didn't work!
Shut up, the camera adds ten pounds.
What? I-I bought groceries, I was gonna make you dinner!
Oh yeah? Ok, let's settle this, come on!
Y'know they say a watched pot never beeps.
Joey, please come. It would mean so much to us.
I can't believe this is taking so long. How are you doing?
Uh well that depends, how are things with Phoebe?
Phoebe and Gary are so gonna hear about this at dinner.
There's nothing we can do. You erased the message!
Yeah! Hey! Thanks for getting me that girl's number.
No Mom, I don't have a restaurant, I work in a restaurant.
Rachel! Rachel! You haven't touched Eldad's hair!
I can't believe they called, and we're actually getting a baby.
Joey, take your time with that. That's my last batch.
Oh, relinquish is just a fancy word for lose!
Not just the phone pen. I never get my messages.
No reason. I-I keep private things in there.
Excuse me? He doesn't even know what he's doing!
Hey Phoebe... how you doin'? You feelin' better?
Easy Rach, we'll find it. Won't we!
Nothing. I just think it's nice when we're all here together.
Ross hasn't worked at the museum for a year!
Where is everybody? They're forty-five minutes late!
Chandler, stop! It is not going to pop open!
Oh, come on it's my wedding! That can be my present.
Oh, so you finally took it out of the marina huh?
No, but he told me, he thinks your a fox.
Well, no. But, um, I bet she probably does.
Oh, and you know who's selling a great apartment? Richard!
All right umm, a string quartet for the procession.
Rach, I know her pretty well, can I go? That's fine.
All right, I've heard enough. I've made my decision.
Well, if you want, you can stay with Rachel and me tonight.
Ok, it's 2100 hours. Time for your toast.
Okay! But you can't rip it. Well, maybe a little.
You and Mona are doing a holiday card together?
Yes, but you cannot tell anyone! No one knows!
He's seeing someone. I can't believe he's seeing someone.
I have no idea. But look how much they spent!
Relax, she-she's gonna give in way before you do!
That kid really kicked me hard on the plane.
Okay. I can do that. I gotta go powder my ass.
Yeah. And y'know, if you wanna cry, that's okay too.
Ross, we're kind of in the middle of diner here.
When you get a sec, another round of daiquiris.
Hey, where is this guy, it's been over an hour!
Do you think they recognize each other from in there?
First, I need a boyfriend, then I can have a list.
It needs to go about 20 blocks to the left!
I can not see him? I mean, you can't tell me what to do!
I don't know what to say. We shouldn't have lied to you.
Wait Chandler come on, let's-it's not a big deal!
I got offered the head chef job at Allesandro's.
Yeah, you can hear everything through these stupid walls.
I kind of have to don't I? Because of this stupid thing.
Oh well, maybe we can put it in the guest bedroom.
Relax, Ross. She's not made of ice cream!
Okay, here's your milk. What do you want to talk about?
Hey, where are all my ovulation-sticks? There's only one here.
No Phoebe, those are like the side affects and stuff.
Honey, the question is...do you really want to marry Joey?
One hour? You are such a leaf blower.
You're still so funny. You're so funny. What do I do?
Now, these are-are more realistic, but perishable.
Joey! Why is Janine not coming over for dinner?!
Why don't I just take off my clothes and have a nightmare.
Where are you guys going? Come on, one more game!
This is amazing. I mean, how, how did this happen?
Hey, cheer up! You're gonna see her again, right?
Well, that was weird. You were loud, and I was fast.
Is that, is that what they call strippers sometimes?
Oh, Joey, please tell me you're only donating your time.
Oh. Well then way to go you big movie star!
Yeah, I've had them picked out since I was fourteen.
Oh really? Okay, let's compare, shall we.
Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please?
Hey Hon, could you help me get the plates down?
This is so great! And I'm gonna be your baby's aunt!
No, it's not a sign! It's a very old key!
Uh, Chandler did! What does he want you to give up?
Wow, she must have hurt you pretty bad, huh?
This is what happens when you don't register for gifts!
Believe me, that is not why we won't be doing that!
Whoa whoa whoa! Where're you goin'?
Okay, I got my note cards. Do you got the presents?
Thank you. Rachel, can I talk to you outside for a sec?
Listen Rachel, I feel really bad about-What are you doing?
I know... it's just... I thought this was, you know... it.
Alright that's great, then just go. Go Knicks.
You cried yesterday at the six o'clock news.
Uh, Aunt Iris? This is Phoebe, and that's Rachel...
Yeah, we used to perform for our family and friends.
I'm quitting!! Woo-hoo! I'm okay!! I'm all right!!
Oh my God! My God! We've got the house !?
To score the winning touchdown, by the way.
No honey, I'm sorry, but the weekend's not over yet.
Close? She's got her tongue in his ear.
Hi! Hey, Pete you're back! Hey, check this out.
Hey, guys. I'm here to pick out my Christmas tree.
I'm also thinking about opening up my own restaurant.
Ok, hypothetically, why won't I be married when I'm 40?
Hey-hey, how goes the dancing? Gay yet?
Okay, count to three. 1. 2. 3!
I can't believe this! This is like the worst night ever!
Oh she misunderstood, she thought she was moving to Tulsa.
Ok, there's enthusiastic and there's just plain gay!!
Thank you. Come meet my friends. This is uh, Phoebe.
Okay, Joey's gonna catch it, and you and I are gonna block.
So Don, what-what other restaurants do you like?
Of course not nothing is. Between me and you...
Oh that's right, that's what I'd sound like if I exploded.
Oh Joey, Melanie called, said she's gonna be late.
'....Won't you, won't you, won't you.... '
You bet your ass, I'm gonna fire you! Thank you.
Phoebe why don't you just call her? You obviously want to.
So is it horrible? Is everybody working really hard?
Wow! Your lip went bald. Hey, thanks.
Why would someone do that?! ...One might wonder.
He's not gonna say anything, because we're not gonna tell him.
Do not start without me. Do not start without me.
Why? It's not like I'm putting little nipples on them.
Well, sure, what with it being her funeral and all.
I can't believe it's raining again! Oh, it's so unfair!!!
Chandler! You don't have to ask for my permission. You can go.
Who did we fight in World War I?
No, he's picking up dinner, why, what's up?
Wow! So, now you're going on a date with this girl?
Are you gonna break up with me if I get fat again?
I'd like a scotch on the rocks with a twist.
Count in our heads as-as good Madlibs.
I'll pick you up at eleven. So glad you're coming.
Wait a minute, they're making you take time off work?
But it didn't. Say hello to Mrs. Chatracus.
Do you still wanna call 'em? I wanna call 'em.
Nobody wants to do it? All right, I'll do it myself.
Okay, Joey's doing the ceremony and Chandler's giving you away.
It is going to be okay! It was worth a shot.
Is he doing his shark attack bit yet?
Oh! Enough! A monkey could have made 'em!
What are you doing?! Chandler! You can't just go back a phase!
Can I ask you just a little question, huh? Why tonight?
If you really want to watch that Serengetti thing, you can.
All right, half the people. I mean, just try it and see.
That could be a four or a five. It's your call.
No it's not! You want it, you're gonna have to win it!
Yeah. We-we had sex and then we fell asleep.
Okay, I-I d'know, you-you just- you have a quality.
So maybe they could umm, call the award the Monica?
So you're gonna be gone four days a week? No.
We're really sorry, but um, she did ask us first.
A small puff of air, now come on!
You're-you're-you're gonna bring the Barca Lounger over here?
My dad told me. They play golf together.
Oh my God, I love how thin these walls are!
You're from Yonkers! Your last name is Buffo-Martisis!
Well, I love it. I only hope my wedding looks this good.
Calling Dr. Big, Dr. Big to the bed.
Oh God, oh God, I am sorry... I am so sorry...
And I suppose you used a ring designer for that.
And about an hour ago, we made an offer.
Oh God... Why don't they put chairs back here?!
All right, I still need a calamari and a Caesar salad.
Wow! I Had no idea you had this much pride.
I'm gonna go across the hall to check on the yams.
Oh, god... She's told you that already, didn't she?!
Oh my God, this man is gonna get naked in my apartment!
I didn't mean to cut it off. It was an accident.
Well, we-we had to go back because I forget my jacket.
Don't worry. You'll find some place to get married.
I can't just walk away! I've put in four hours!
No, but that's probably 'cause I haven't asked them yet.
Don't feel bad for me! I won like every time!
Ross, is he gonna live with you, like, in your apartment?
Hey dad, what's up? Oh God. Ross, it's Nana.
Well that's the best part. Umm, you guys get to decide!
Hey, we could have used that kind of thinkin' earlier.
The waiter carried the breadsticks in his pants!
Well, I want he baby to come out all cute and fat!
Oh, when you get over this breakup we need to go shopping.
That's sounds great, but how are you going to afford it?
Oh, can I borrow this? My milk's gone bad.
This is it. Yeah, this is the one. I can't believe I found it!
Ok, thanks for coming, I hope you guys had fun.
Why are you reading this? You hate this kind of stuff.
Uhm the... the ministry... of names... bureau...
Oh, of course, it's so nice to see you again, Zack!
I... I'm sorry, who should be along in a what now?
Do you guys know what happened to Chandler's barca lounger?
Dad, dad. We got it!! We Got It!!!
Oh my God, oh my God. Call me on the phone!
Now come on. Well, I'm glad we worked things out.
So, how about you huh? How do you know the happy couple?
This is different! Greg and Jenny are in a relationship.
Are you sure he didn't break it because it really hurts.
Well if-if that's what it is, then it's-it's crazy.
He would just roll me over and I would stop snoring.
Hey, Rach, you're leaving tomorrow, shouldn't you be packing?
Honey, we don't really have to go to this thing tonight do we?
Joey, stop hitting on her! It's her wedding day!
I tried to reach you at work. There's....been a fire.
Honey, listen... You have nothing to worry about with Geoffrey.
Oh, wow, can you believe you're like three weeks away?
I know! Hey, you haven't been practising the routine, have you?
Are you okay? You've been acting weird all afternoon.
Honey, you're just in time, I'm about to sing another song!
I don't know. Rachel I'm-I'm sorry that I hurt your ankles.
She doesn't have a stomach ache, she's in labor.
Wendy? -- That sounds like a girl's name.
No, I have just to have two more points to beat him!
Well, I'd like to but, I'm not sure we have time to go.
Rachel! What is your cat doing in one of my bowls!
He's coming. Be cool, be cool, be cool.
I just talked to Joey, I just-I want to see how you were.
What's the matter, officer? Has someone been bad?
Why do you guys have so many keys in there anyway?
Do you think breaking up with him was a huge mistake?
My pink flowered bra! I recognize the strap!
No, umm, he met some girl at the coffee house.
Okay, Mike and Joey, get in position. Chandler, come with me.
Come on, was it somebody maybe you dated in college?
Do you really think marrying someone else is the right answer?
Please. Half the guys out there have makeup on.
Ohh, you are such a good boss! Is she pretty?
What?..... What, you wanna spell it out with noodles?
Phoebe? Oh, Phoebe, I'm so sorry. Have you been here long?
Apparently you were umm, a little mean to him in high school.
Go on, teach me something about men and women.
Oh please, he didn't hear it! He didn't hear it!!
But Ben is coming over tonight and he can't see this.
Please, it's a relief is what it is, is what it is.
What kind of social situation are you comfortable with?
Ah no, the other Phoebe, the one you went to go see.
I just told my Mom I'd cater a party for her.
Oh my God! Ohh! Look at this one! It's so beautiful!
Mail call, Rachel Green, bunk seven.
I-I don't-I don't think that I'm gonna wear the boots tonight.
He took up the carpet, and now you can hear everything.
Wait a minute, who told you? You are dead meat.
Ok, thank you. Uh, well this is it. Are you OK?
Ohh! Did you do what I said? Did-did-did you tell her?
All right, umm, we're not gonna really keep it this way though.
The ones we had right after you almost threw up.
Oh, we weren't talking about you. No, no way to recover.
Dad! There's Ross , why don't you go talk to him?
Okay, so how do I make him think I wanna have sex with him?
Look, here's a picture of Scotty Jared naked.
Rach! We weren't gonna miss our friends getting married!
The big hat, the pearls, the little pick handbag.
She's not pregnant. It's Rachel. Rachel's the one who's pregnant.
Okay, wait, you gotta hang up 'cause we're gonna be late.
'Fraid so. Brown hair, green eyes...
See, didn't I tell you?! You're getting over Ross already!
Mom! Dad! Ross smoked pot in college!
Hey, guys, what-what should I wear to a Knicks game?
Phoebe, do you want to go see a movie after dinner tonight?
OK, we got the cole slaw, we got the buns...
Those cute little black ones I wear all the time.
No! Are you doing it?! I don't hear anything! Come on!
So, why wait 'til Saturday, are you free tomorrow?
Awww, y'know what your nickname is, Mr. Big...
Chandler, we said we would meet at the coffeehouse at six.
Hey Joey, Chandler sold a story to Archie Comics!
What happened? You still have the Monica wedding fund don't you?
Oh my God, you can't even see where the Titanic hit it.
Wait. He pooped in my shoe? Which one?
Well, um, because mainly, um, they don't like you. I'm sorry.
Can we have our drinks please?! Waiter-Uh, tress!
Hmm, well you're around me all the time and you don't flirt.
Come on guys! Let's go! Come on, it's second down.
Well that is great. And seriously, she seems very nice.
Thanks, I'm set. Do you still live with your parents?
I'll bet he's totally over me, I'll bet he's fine.
Why?! Why? Why, why would anybody do something like that?
You just put an empty carton back in the fridge!
Well you look incredible too! You're just-you're so fit!
Oh hi! Hi! Y'know, we were just talking about bacon.
How are we gonna get home? Maybe a piggy-back ride?
Yeah, I changed them. I-I sent you a fax about it!
Y'know dad, Chandler is one of Ross's very best friends!
Hey, I have all the space I need. Just do what I did.
Yes smokie, that is what it was. I just can't get enough.
Oh my God! Well push it in! Push it in!
I hope you're not full, 'cause dinner's almost ready.
Okay, so from now on we have to call you Princess Consuela?
If it is a new message, what is he calling to say?
I don't care. Oh my god. I've lost the will to scold.
I can't believe he has a new roommate. Who is this guy?
He is so cute. So, where did you guys grow up?
Woah, woah, woah, let's go back to 29.
Hey, I made $17 before breakfast, what have you done?
Hard 8?! We should call it easy 8!
Oh my God! He just said my name! Did you hear that?
Well, I was going for wrong, but we can use your word.
Wow! It took you all night to come up with that plan?!
Don't worry, after a while he'll tune it out.
Oh yeah that's what you want - my inhibitions lowered.
Because he'll know what to do? Oh my God, you're a genius!
I need more swordfish. Can you get me some more swordfish?
Ooh, what'cha gonna do, fat boy, huh? What?
Joey, you're this guy's teacher. I mean how could you do this?
I wish I could say the same. I'm a little shook up!
No, wait, please don't go! I've got porn for you too!
Well...it's just umm...I'm afraid you might mess it up.
Well, we don't really have to decide anything right now, do we?
Did it ever occur to you that I might just be that stupid?
Chandler, look I-I know that your dad embarrassed you. I know...
So Phoebe, why are there men's shoes by the door.
Ooh, umm, oh Kathy! Kathy, I love you! Oh!
You can also find him under umm, dog and dead.
What is it? Is there something fundamentally unmarriable about me?
Oh my god, little Stevie Fisher? How've you been?
In that cute, little, sweet way she just did?
Oh, I wish I didn't have to wait to take a pregnancy test.
I can't believe you tried to cut me out. Why Phoebe, why?
Upstairs in the bathroom right before you felt up mom.
I'm sorry, they surprised me. There was nothing I could do!
Huh? What'd ya say Joe? I'll be right there.
You were staring about eight inches south of there.
Okay, Rachel, you wanna put the marshmellows in concentric circles.
There are no jobs. There are no jobs for me.
All right, sweetie that's fine. You didn't do it on purpose.
Thank you. All right, now who else do you want to invite?
So it looks like it's going really well for you two, huh?
Yeah? What does she think of your little science project?
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I-I should probably leave you girls alone.
You have got to get over this. You're not gonna end up alone.
Look look! He's doing it again, the guy with the telescope!
So I, I told Rachel it was just gonna be the two of us.
If only there were a smaller one to clean this one!
Of course we will, come on we gotta make dinner.
What do I smell? I smell smoke. Huh-did you smoke?
It's not Richard! Okay? It's this new guy and he's really good.
Oh my God, I went to high school with her. Rachel! Hi!
: yeah he has to stay in Tulsa this weekend.
Well, y'know it's none of my business, but aren't you married?
Well, he's my parents' best friend, he has to be there.
You just wanna stay home so you can make a move on Joey!
Alright, I've got a leg, three breasts and a wing.
I wanted to do this days ago so I think I should go first.
William Sonoma, fall catalog, Page 27.
Okay, have you considered using a girl with huge knockers?
That's a great idea! I was saving them for something special.
Well, that's okay dad, we-we can wait until later.
Okay? Ooo wee! Christmas party in my boots!
Wow! For just a week you guys are really close, huh?
Alright, I'm gonna go pick up a few things for the trip.
Now, are you glad we didn't start with the bikini strips?
That didn't work on mom, it's not going to work on us.
Wait a minute, she isn't... She's not the one who you...
Wait wait! I can't sing in front of all these people.
And make sure our room isn't next to theirs .
You guys, Joey just saw Janice kissing her ex-husband.
Hi, welcome home. I need to borrow a hundred bucks.
Umm, wait! Do you want to set the mood a little?
I'm gonna go to the bathroom, maybe I'll see you there in a bit?
Yeah, I'm going to take a bath. I'm just going to get a magazine.
Oh god, waddawe do, waddawe do, waddawe do?
I just thought it would be nice if I could have just this one night!
Did you ever go out with a guy your friends all really like?
Joey, she was listing the countries she's done it in.
No you're fine. All right well, do you think I could take Rachel?
Ohhh, oh my God! Oh my God! She knows about us!
Oh, that's there on the bottom, see the manager, Chandler Bing.
No, no, no, no, no, no pressure, no pressure!
Okay, well, why don't we all meet upstairs in an hour?
Well, it's done about two minutes before it looks like that.
Congratulations! Wow! I can't believe you're nominated for an Emmy!
Joey is gonna be a celebrity guest on a game show!
Yeah, we all have jobs. See, that's how we buy stuff.
Well, you used to dress up in Mom's clothes all the time.
Yeah... yeah, I think there is. -What were you gonna say?
Oh honey, is that 'cause your Mom died around Christmas?
Why don't you just be straight with her? Tell her the truth.
Ha ha, a joke that's funny in all countries.
Uh- Rachel has left the building, can you call back?
But that's clearly a joke. This could easily be true.
Hi! Umm, I'm Monica Geller, I'm the chef at Alessandro's.
I'll take it down to 95% but that's the best I can do.
I'll meet somone else. There'll be other Alans.
Why don't you come over tonight? And I'll make you favorite dinner.
Okay, you can not tell Chandler. Okay? That I ran into Richard.
Because you're on my team! And my team always wins!
Spend more time with the tie. That'll make a baby.
I'm Monica Gellar. Who do you know the bride and groom?
Nope. Going to the Big Apple Circus today.
I arranged some pillows on the bed to look like a guy.
He's not boring! He's just-he's just low key.
I know, but what are we gonna do? She really needs this job.
Well, if it annoys you so much, then why do you do it?
Ross married Rachel in Vegas! And got divorced! Again!!!!
That's right! You lose sucker!! Please still marry me.
No, nononono.. it's just.. things change. People change.
Oh God bless my dad sound proofing the basement!
There's nothing to tell! He's just some guy I work with!
Does Ralph mumble when you're not paying attention?
There's a pregnant woman in Ohio, and she picked us!
Oh, not at all. I have no morals and I need the cash.
Thanks, that would be great. Hey, honey, wouldn't that be great?
You know what this is, this is us getting ready for the prom.
Are you nuts?! We've got George Stephanopoulos' pizza!
Now? Is it okay if I go out with Chip Matthews?
Hey, Rache. You know what we haven't played in a while?
Ohmygod! Rat baby! Rat baby! Rat baby!
That does not mean you know us better, I-I want a rematch.
Okay, great! Bye. So guess who's coming to Thanksgiving dinner?
Because there are so many terrible sights in this world.
It's on us, all right, so don't worry. It's our treat.
All right baby, come on! Yes! Yes! I am on fire!
Oh my god, Joey, for all we know this guy could be horribly...
Can you believe it? I finally get to run my own kitchen!
Oh yeah, well there's the possibility that I won't make rent.
And that's why, I'm not inviting you in for a drink. Bye.
Ross, we haven't done the routine since middle school.
Okay! Okay! We can take a hint! What are you doing here?!
This is so cool, maybe this is something you can do every week.
How could I be asleep knowing that you were in the next room.
Matt Guire, Mark Lynn, Ben Wire...
Here's Frannie. Hmm, won't she be happy to see me?
Gosh, doesn't it seem like a million years ago?
No, please don't. Please, Joey. She will kill us!
Oh wait! You didn't just sit on my Kit-Kats did you?!!
Even Mary Tyler Moore would've been better.
What are you talking about?! 007 has all those gadgets!
As a thank you, Rachel and I will kiss for one minute.
I'm fine, just a little tired, I'm okay. How's Richard doing?
Honey, it's not pushy, he gave her his home number.
He's with Emily at a Bed and Breakfast in Vermont!
No. You don't have any of these cute little obsessive things.
Phoebe, they didn't make you pay for those knives, did they?
Nothing, just never seen you in little stretchy pants before.
Twenty bucks says they're married within the month.
Okay, let's do it. Mom and Dad are gonna be so faced!
Wait a minute! We're talking about someone that I'm going out with?
Wow. Then I would definitely not recommend Mrs. Doubtfire.
Wait, what that place, that pub he took us too?
Oh, I can't wait for everyone at work to see these... Ow!
Hey, have you figured out a way to tell him you're moving out?
Okay, let's start with the free messages outside the UN.
Well actually, I-I didn't eat mine. It's still in the bathroom.
And well, we probably shouldn't see each other anymore. I'm sorry.
Phoebe, do you think that your favorite animal says much about you?
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You know what, the way you did it was just fine.
What are you, animals? It's 4 o'clock in the afternoon!
Chandler, we still haven't gotten an RSVP from your dad.
That's right. Get it out of your system while we're alone.
You promised Dr. Weinburg, you'd never use that phrase.
No, he'll be fine. It's the other five I'm worried about.
I know, after you left the store, I chose different ones.
Chandler, you're an only child, right? You don't have any of this.
Yes you are! That's the only way to explain all this stuff!
Run, Marcel, run! Run, Marcel! Are you okay?
Ohh, sweetie! Hey, I bet you anything that he's gonna call you again.
Honey, if you know it through a wall, you know it too well!
Alright, great. Thanks a lot. I'm going to tap class.
I think, that if you really like this guy, you should just trust him.
No fair. I don't even have one. How come they get two?
I guess that makes sense. So, you think you're going to talk to him?
What are you doing here? I thought you had to do inventory all day.
Excuse me, umm, can I talk to you over here for just a second?
I know it's last minute, but we decided to have a Halloween party.
You know how much I love listening to your music, you know, but...
Oh, is it that pinball machine with the big bow on it?
Wow! It's really red! You should go see my eye doctor.
I'm sorry, I didn't know to look for Chinese food on the floor.
It's only been a couple of hours, so just give it some time.
This isn't how it's supposed to go, there can't be another guy.
Pretty much. So, what do you, what do you think of the floor?
... that she was the huge guy that mugged you? Yah.
Phoebe, don't worry about it. I'm sure she wants to live with you.
Honey, that's a great idea nailing the boxes to the floor!
Rach, you know that birthing tape you wanted to see? It's here.
So, did you come by to watch us win the big bucks?
If-if-if we ever did what you did a man would never call.
Hey, guys, guys, did you see my new, china cabinet?!
Who? Who do you know that are friends that just fool around?
These tiny, little non-breasts?! Please, it's gotta be Rachel.
Okay, okay. You two go get the dessert. And I'll let you in.
Get in there man! Flirt back, mix it up!
Three down knows I'm married, what's three down doin'?
I'm sorry honey, but we're gonna take you shopping. It's gonna be fine.
I've got a question. Richard made plans again with the guys.
I have been looking for them all week and she is wearing them!
I won't care, because I know you will be feeling it all in here.
Stop it. Stop! Okay let's go. We can be strong.
I personally would be honored if she wanted to live with me.
Okay.. Well, I'm going out with a guy my friends all really like.
Aw, I'm sorry sweetie that she doesn't feel the same way.
Oh Rachel, I know the best coffee house and it's sooo close.
Good. Uh honey, the Miami Vice soundtrack? Really?
All right, I'll do it just this once! But you can't tell anybody!
See now-now you're taking them away from their home.
Yeah. Run ten blocks, that'll help the smell.
I eat by myself in the alley because everybody hates me.
Is he really coming? Because I can see right into your apartment!
Mr. Bigot. He tells the most racist jokes.
You know what, I think it's cute, you trying to be more like Richard.
Oh, good to see you too. Did you come down here to tell me that?
We know how tough those parent/teacher conferences can be.
Wait a minute! Now I'm betting against all three of you?
Do you want to go to the bathroom, or do you wanna play poker?
Look umm, of all people, you do not want me to tell this story!
Alright . I think it's a big mistake but it's your decision.
Maybe she will. Uh! Why couldn't I have been a Reverend?
Quick, take off your dress, he won't notice the bed.
Wow! And around the ankles, y'know that is a tough spot.
Hey, they don't pay me a penny a word to make friends.
Did you ever feel like sometimes you are just so unbelievably uncoordinated?
Oh wait, Chandler, come here is there anything I can do? Anything?
Or if you want to kiss him, umm, you could use mistletoe.
I gotta go to work. Has anybody seen my left boob?
For the sixteenth time, no... I do not think you're obsessive.
Oh my God! Ross, are you in England? Was Emily surprised?
I can't believe you thought I was cheating. You own me an apology.
On three, 1...2...3! Now my pillow's all wet!
I love it! It's huge!! Let's open it! Open it!!
I know why do you think he was so worried about me getting bigger?
Ok, so you've done some good work! What about your carry-ons?
I'm sure everything's fine. Has her water broke yet?
Maybe. I just hope she realizes how hard it's gonna be.
Okay, what if the person who adopts the other one is horrible?
Two? TWO? How is that possible? I mean, have you seen you?
That was some hot love you gave me! I'm gonna go get ready.
Hey! Where 'ya headin' in those pants? 1982?
You guys are dead, I am so good at lighting rounds.
What?! Are you crazy?! I'm not getting married! I'm not even engaged.
I said that you had a nice butt, it's just not a great butt.
Well thank God you were here! I mean, we have to erase that!
I knew it!! Y'know, you're not so quiet yourself, missy!
That's what you've been working on for the past two hours?!
We'll be right there! Can't you just say it starts later?
Phoebe, you do seem a little tense. Here, let me help you.
Well, I guess we've established who's staying here with Monica...
It's never taken you more than a shower to get over a relationship.
Is anyone thankful for anything else besides a thong?
Maybe a Hello Kitty doll, the ability to walk...
Who has her own little desk when Roland's not there.
Tell them I'm a chef in a big New York restaurant!
I swear I've seen birds do this on Wild Kingdom.
Well you can't! We're booked solid for the next month!
It's okay, 'cause y'know what? You don't really need me for the business.
Hi! Can you do that and walk? 'Cause she said, "Next."
My God! Chandler, we said be 'aloof' not 'a doof'.
Okay. Let's hurry-Oh wait! Do we have a condom? Oh right!
What-what's the matter? Is there, is there something on my dress?
Oooh, I wish she could stay here, but Chandler is allergic!
Well, the good news is, I don't think anyone's looking at us.
Well, if you don't have anything to copy, why are you going down there?
You ordered a stripper for the shower?! That is totally inappropriate!
Are you kidding me?! Is this; is this turning you on?
That guy stood on your neck until you passed out!
You go back out there and you seduce her till she cracks!
It's wrong. You know what else is wrong? Phoebe picking Rachel.
This woman's got my life, I should get to see who she is.
All right, just give it back to me when your done. See you guys.
Y'know what? I-I think that umm, I don't feel like going to The Plaza.
Hey, don't mix those up, you could really ruin that lollipop.
Is that the one that speaks English or the one that doesn't?
You are so handsome! I wanna make love to you right here, right now!
Pleased to meet you. So you're coming to Rachel's party tonight?
Oh please! Did you hear that? Little drops of heaven.
I'm gonna go tell Joey that that you're back. I was really worried about you.
Well it wasn't my fault, Phoebe was in charge of the invitations!
No, but someone's really not going to get over that idea, are they?
Sweetie okay. It's okay. Everybody made it to the wedding. I'm fine.
That's my old dog. He passed away years ago.
With that moustache doesn't Chandler remind you of Aunt Sylvia?
Joe... Emus are birds. You raise them for meat.
Hello? What?! You what?! Hey you listen here missy! Wh-
Welcome home. I've missed you. join me in the bedroom?
Oh good God! If you want a baby so bad just go steal it!
No-no-no, don't-don't do the accent. You've got to see her again.
Well, I know that would make Joey happy, so, I would like that too.
All right, were you guys smoking something in the back of our van?
Ohh! Ohhhh! Were you sleeping sweetie? I'm sorry. Here.
Phoebe, we're getting married, married; not sixth grade married.
'A Woman Undone, by Rachel Karen Green'.
No, the one who looked at you once because you got in her way.
It was a project for one of the Home Ec classes.
I can't live like this! What are we gonna do? What are we gonna do?
No, you don't want this. I want to have your grandmother's cookie recipe.
Okay, so what do you, what do you want to do? Let's do something crazy!
Oh, okay. Alright, it's flight 421. Leaves at 8:40.
Uh yeah, I-I actually I thought about you a couple months ago.
Of course you can look at it! Yeah, I want your opinion too!
Yes, I'm sure! Rachel is there something that you want to talk me about?
I love how it crumbles. Now see, your chocolate doesn't do that.
You must feel horrible. Hey! The guys have free porn!
How can that be?! Oh wait! Wait! Are you, are you serious?!
Absolutely! It would just be one friend helping out another friend.
Joey, please don't do that. I think it's best that we just forget about it.
All right, I'm gonna go to work. Does anybody have a problem with that?
Do you want some shortbread? Eh that's Scottish like you are.
Oh wow wow wow!! Make room for your friend!
Chandler, relax it's not a contest. Certainly not a close one.
What, Phoebe, did you whip the potatoes? Ross needs lumps!
Great! We're hangin' in the kitchen! Let's stay in the kitchen!
I guess you can get back to deciding on what to get me for a present!
Okay, I've got some Ones, you wanna put them in her panties?
You know, if you just wait another... six and a half minutes...
Nobody move! Okay, you look that way; I'll look this way!
Alright, we don't know that it's him. I mean, it could be the football guy.
Hey, do you realize that at this time tomorrow we'll be getting married?
Phoebe! Come on I'm serious! I just got to talk to him about all this.
Well, maybe you could give to somebody else. Ooh, like Ross Geller.
Y'know, I don't like to brag about it, but I give the best massages!
Bye bye Mike!/Cya mike!/Bye mike!/Bye bye now!
Ohh... that wouldn't by any chance be... Joey Tribbiani?
Mom, uh, Chandler was just saying how beautiful your sweater is.
Where were you? We were supposed to meet in the wine cellar?
Ross this is the only thing left that has a shot at working.
So. Welcome. Is this your first time you're seeing Emma?
Oh my gosh! Rachel, honey.. are you okay? Where-where's Paolo?
Hey guys check it out! My mom sent me the paper!
Yeah. It's my dad's birthday, I decided to give him a stroke.
I missed you-you ugly, flat faced old freak!
Wait, Joey! Joey! That doesn't mean that-that you're in love with me!
Well, when you first met Barry, you flitted off to Vail.
Okay, can we change the topic? Because it's really doing nothing for me.
Well, she's not going to find them lying in the grass like that.
Chandler, what are you doing? That thing can put someone's eye out!
Phoebe, Sandra's mad at you too. It-it doesn't bother you?
A new pair of shoes for the Chan-Chan man! Yes!
Right! .. but we "know" what you're wishing for!
Okay! Okay! Okay! We'll see you in about 3 to 4 hours.
Rach, that's great! It's so good that you had a good time in Greece!
Why don't you just have a seat here? OK... give me the Gummi-bears.
I know that there's no hole there, I just really liked that picture.
But you should eat them now because they're hot from the oven.
Okay, does it involve something to do with Pete's computer company?
Dad , Mom . Look! Look who it is it's Chandler!
Hey, come on Phoebe, you can understand why this would be weird for me.
That's Dudley Moore. I said I wanted it like Demi Moore.
: Honey why don't you just let it go and ask her out again.
Umm, if ah, it might be okay if Ross came skiing?
Yeah, apparently they're turning it into some kinda coffee place.
It's not gonna happen. They're doing it tonight, we can do it tomorrow.
All right, we'll stay. We can just drive up after the party.
Chandler, please don't think I was trying to pressure you. Phoebe and Rachel...
You know what, Ross? I'm gonna throw in 50 bucks for you.
What happened to your rule about never sleeping with sick people?
You touch people's eyeballs every day and this feels weird.
Come on. I know you're not eighteen anymore, but give it a minute.
I can't believe it! What is it? Is it the rubbing or the smell?
Oh, honey, can you make sure we get a King size bed!
No, they were really cool. They were on their honeymoon too!
I-I-I wanna thank you all for coming. My family and my friends...
And everybody has to wear costumes. Come on! It'll be fun!
Oh, don't you guys look cute. You guys make such a cute couple.
Hello? Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Okay. I guess we can bet one more time.
Congratulations, I think youve found the worlds thinnest argument.
Good. Okay, I'm just gonna wait for Chandler to open the rest of them.
Well, what do you think of Mike and Chandler being in a car accident?
I mean, I-I, I really shouldn't say. I mean, I'm really not supposed to.
I'd like to have Don and Phoebe over. Wouldn't that be nice?
Two in a row! You've got to use your tongues now!
Oh my pleasure. Okay, I'm afraid I've got some bad news. Phoebe!
Ok, fine!! I bought 20 extra tickets for me and Chandler.
I'm not crying about that! I'm crying about something that happened at work.
What one? You wanted him to invite you to the party and he did it!
Chandler come on. We have to hem the new dust ruffle.
And that's great for you guys, but we want a lawn and a swingset...
Ok, we're not having birthday cake, we're having birthday flan.
Phoebe, listen. You were with me, and we were shopping all day.
All right okay, just so you know, I'm not gonna make a turkey this year.
Nope, she doesn't have to, I found out who the father is.
Our kids are gonna call her Aunt Janice aren't they?
Yeah, the best you got in high school was Wet Pants Geller.
What about the second minister we meet with? I kinda liked him.
Chandler? I was just in our bedroom and I found these on my pillow.
A wuss? Excuse me for living in the real world, okay?
Hey Joey! Aww, you remembered even though you're a big star!
No, it's not bad. It's not bad at all. It's-it's really nice.
Ross, you were right before, it was just a stupid fight about a room.
I'm fine-d. I'm fine-d! Y'know, it's a really hard word to say.
Hi, um, I'm gonna need a new set of these forms .
Wow! And you got a petticure. Your feet are all dressed up.
Yeah! I didn't know there would be dancing. That was a fun surprise!
So on this road trip, did you guys win any money?
Oh my God, this is great! This is so great! . Did you hear that?
I'm Monica. I'm disgusting. I stalk guys and keep their underpants.
Ohh come on, I love this song! Come on, you'll be fine.
Joey, what are you doing?! It's never gonna happen, she's seeing somebody.
Nah, while you're at Ross's if you see any lying around...
The Way You Look Tonight is on here! Dance with me?
Put the plates in the boxes!! Put the plates in the boxes!
Hey Rach, maybe your resolution should be to umm, gossip less.
I know, Amanda! Ah! She called me too! She's the worst!
See? They're as different as night and... later that night.
All right, look, nobody's smoking pot around all this food.
Didn't you hear that speech? If you don't kiss him then I will!
You're gonna like him so much. So umm, when do you want to meet him?
Yeah. I'm okay. I'm actually-I'm a little cold, can I have your jacket?
No! I was just getting into position and then everything went dark.
Okay, this isn't working. I'm still awake and now I have to pee.
Chandler, nobody likes breaking up with someone. You just gotta do it.
Okay, please be good, please. Just remember how much you all like me.
Oh, maybe he was getting him confused with his childhood therapist.
Hi. Uh, we'll be right there, we're just trying to decide something.
And I don't know if you've noticed but she's a HOTTY!! HI!
God, Ross is on a date with your sister! How weird is that?!
No it's not. We had an inspection and they didn't find anything.
Oh my God! Oh my God that's awful! What did you think of the house?
Hey Joey! Isn't that the girl that waved at you the other day?
This is so great! Now we can enter into doubles tournaments!
Oh, who cares, they still love me! "I am so excited..."
Wouldn't kick her out of bed. No more Vodka for me!
Ross , foot on the floor or come over no more!
What are you serious? You wanna marry him? Wha... What about Mike?
If that falls off the truck, it wouldn't be the worst thing.
Ross, just forget about it. This guy's got you totally wedged in.
I'm just saying, if we put just a little bit of makeup on you.
Because Purvry Perverson over here can't stop staring at her.
Are we playing football or what? Come on you hairy-backed Marries.
You're right, I'm sorry. It's not like you're y'know, going out with an ex-girlfriend.
Don't joke with me, okay? I'm very, very upset right now.
Also both of your sisters called and neither can make it.
The dinner will be ready in twenty minutes. This is so exciting.
Finger cramp. Oh God, sorry. Here, let me get that mom.
A quin pidio el pollo General Tso?
Ross, I think we should stick to the routine, we don't wanna look stupid!
Ohh, here you are. Y'know, I'm-I'm glad you decided to hear me out.
So you can like, bite, and pull people's hair and stuff?
Oh, that's okay, I can't wait to see everything again! All of the memories...
They gave us a fake number? Why? Why would they do that?
Jellyfish sting! Oh, it hurts! It hurts!! It hurts!!
Yeah, but Janice? That-that was like the worst breakup in history!
Phoebe, y'know why don't we just go upstairs and have some birthday cake?
Hey. Where is he, where's Richard? Did you ditch him?
Ahhh, hey honey? Don't you have to be at your interview now?
Keep on roaming Bert! We don't want any crazy today!
Look it is not my fault that your chairs are incredibly ugly!
Oh come on! You're making it sound worse than it actually was.
There's no man in here. How dare you accuse me of that.
I can't believe this. Do you think that your parents could help pay for it?
Excuse me, sir, would it help if I weren't wearing underpants?
That is the unusual activity. Look, they just wanna see if you're okay.
Inside of telling us you decided to write in your stupid book!
Um, and, well there's the.. the the small matter of...
Rachel! I'm never gonna think it's okay for you to cheat on your husband!
I can't leave it! You gouged a hole in my dingy floor.
No! No. They're umm... They're just uh...ground beef smileys.
Oh my God! That's Pete! But why is Bill huggin' Pete?
Maybe you don't need him to propose to you, maybe you can propose to him!
Oh, you two must have been so cute running around on a barge.
Oh, that's okay. By the way, I was just checking the shower massager.
Umm, going to the beach. When it stays light real late.
Because we're moving in a couple of days and it just didn't make sense.
What?! You're crazy! There's nothing sexual about the noises I make!
And I assume, Chandler, you are still boycotting all the pilgrim holidays.
Sweetie, I think the glasses look great. They make you look really sexy.
..well, why don't you tell them? After all it, is your ankle.
Well, I mean I guess there is no harm in putting my name down.
Hey, stay out of this, Chandler! This is between me... and ME!
We're not really gonna buy these people steak dinners are we?
Yes, a relationship. For your information I am crazy about this man.
Uh, Rach... how come you have dental floss in your hair?
I guess I set up the video camera to try and entice Joey.
Thank you. This is my friend Phoebe. She's gonna be helping me tonight.
Y'know what, that's fine, maybe you haven't grown up, but I have.
That really means a lot. Oh, and Mom, don't bite your nails.
Okay, so I'm responsible, I'm organised. But hey, I can be a kook.
Passport, check! Camera, check! Traveller's cheques, check!
No! Ace is low! Ace, two, three, four!
Uh, I don't know, butter, eggs, flour, lime, kiwi--
I can't think of anything we're doing. Why can't I think of anything we're doing?
And people will think you own a Porsche because you're wearing the clothes?
You don't? Well, that's the difference between a professional and a layman.
No it's umm, more like a wrap. Okay so uh, I'm gonna go guys.
Rachel umm, I was just talking to this guy and I think he'll have sex with you.
He called the Long Island Expressway a concrete miracle.
Okay, I will. Remember that thing that we just discussed that you wanted to do?
Right. Till I bought a blow dryer, then I was shunned.
Yes! We found you a really cute and funny guy from Chandler's work!
Mr. Heckles, our friend lost a monkey. Have you seen it?
Umm. Well, there's Rachel, and umm, I think that's it. How bout you?
Hey! It's me. Mon-i-ca! Can I just tell you how proud I am of you.
: then why were you watching them and giving YOURSELF a treat.
There's still so much to do. Have you written your vows yet?
I can't walk. Okay? Okay? These boots were a huge mistake!
Doesn't matter, I'll get 'em tomorrow. Or not. Whenever.
Umm, Chandler, if you want I can make you some macaroni and cheese for dinner.
Right, you only go for them 5 minutes before they get married.
They love my candy? Oh man!!! I've gotta go make more!!
Hey Rach, remember that great song, Me, Myself, and I?
We're just two people who find each other very attractive. Right?
Ah, and I mean, he's going out with her? He can not persue this.
Well I'd probably be scared of a guy using a fake voice.
Noo! My ex-boyfriend Richard! Y'know the tall guy, moustache?
Would you slap me? Would you slap me right here in the face?!
Hey, did you get the turkey basted-Oh my God! Oh my God! Who is that?
Oh! Did anybody see that-that documentary on the Korean War?
Come on! So she comes to the wedding! I mean it won't be so bad.
Didn't it drive you crazy to have a switch and not know what it did?
No-no, I-I really don't want to talk about it! I don't! Especially with you.
Well, maybe the mailman liked the cookies, we just didn't give him enough.
All right! Come on Monica! Look alive! Come on, look alive!
Well, I mean what about friends of your grandmother's? Wouldn't they have the recipe?
No! Umm well, some people say that Oysters are an aphrodisiac.
Well, let's just say it's not the first time you've stolen my thunder.
She's the actress that was in Disclosure, Indecent Proposal, Ghost!
Toe the line. Thread the needle. Think outside the box!
I know! I mean it's like me and your dad, that's a totally separate thing.
How hammered are you? Huh? These, these are Joey's sisters.
Oh it's umm, good! It's umm, it's good, just here watering the plants.
Ooh, an ink stain! Hey, can I watch how you get this out?
Uh, huh. Or maybe to a galaxy far, far away.
I thought I lost it. I got a new one, like, a month ago.
I think our lover's spat will start a little early this month.
I can't believe my parents are actually pressuring me to find one of you people.
Just like you told her you did! ... Just pointing out the irony.
We are going to Dick Clark's New Year's Rocking Eve!
Oh my God, she's not gonna like the chicken that night either is she?!
Hey, Rach, can I borrow your eyelash curler, I think I lost mine.
So your first whole weekend without Ben, what're you guys gonna do?
I know, he's just so, so... Do you remember you and Tony DeMarco?
God, you are so lucky. I mean, I mean. . . you know what I mean.
Joey, now that you're okay with the house, do you wanna go see your room?
Do you umm, you really think the best reason to get married is because you're sorry?
Yep, we're gonna meet the lady who could be carrying our baby.
Please! I feel so bad! Just watch the hot woman get naked!
Dr. Miller? P E C F D.
Well what are you gonna do when he finds out he wasn't even asked?!
Yeah, I asked you and Phoebe to pick up the pies. You did remember, right?
Oh, yes, umm, I'm here to pick up a dress that you have on hold.
You guys! Do you realize that any minute now, Phoebe can be pregnant?
Hey, how did it go with Mike, is he gonna let you keep the painting?
Hey. Okay, I gave him another chance, but Tim has got to go!
When I take a shower, she leaves me little notes on the mirror.
Ok, let me go check. Your mom want's to say goodbye.
No I don't know Chandler! Not anymore! It's like it's like something's changed.
You-you gotta take it now. Come on, do it as a present to me.
Joey let me ask you a question. What does this light switch do?
Well, if we owe it? Oh my... When is Joey gonna be home?
Limited seating my ass. Let's see who made the cut. Hi!
No no, it's not working on me. Wow! I must be growing up!
Rachel, you are packed though right, I mean please tell me that you're packed.
No it's not! No! No! Now it's about you and Ross getting back together!
Yeah, ah, but Pheebs don't you think he's a little young to get married?
Yeah, and we've paid for a room, that we're supposed to be in right now!
All right relax Mr. I've Had Sex Four Times!
Like I remember his office number! Speed dial 7.
Dr. Burke? I don't think so. I mean, like, he's a grown up.
Okay, I feel like I'm talking to Lassie. All right, Phoebe would you just tell me!
Oh, it's so beautiful. Ohh! Y'know, I-I don't know if I feel right about this.
Well, tonight, I actually went out with Chip Matthews in high school.
Anyway erm, are you going to get a handyman to install this stuff?
Not never. I mean, I'm gonna see him tomorrow at my eye appointment.
Hey! Okay, so I thought we'd start with my make up and then do my hair.
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
You're still gonna pay me, right? Or something a little less selfish.
What these? Oh, these are, um, for.. cuts and scrapes.
Look look! It's Rachel and Barry. No, don't everybody look at once!
What are you talking about? If you get married in Vegas you're married everywhere.
Oh, you really want to talk about getting people to like you huh, funny man?
Ok, which one of us do you think is gonna be the first one to get married?
Okay, it's baby time. Pants off Bing. Didn't see you there Geller.
Hey Ross! So, I was checking out the uh, real estate section...
A little tight? I could see double-oh and seven in those pants.
Forget it. Not after your cousin who could belch the alphabet.
It was a mistake. Please don't take this to mean anything, because it doesn't.
Ohh, I'm such an idiot. I can't believe I actually thought she could change.
Yeah sure, nature called, she wanted to see who else did.
Oh, it was awful. I guess some people just don't appreciate really good food.
Oh, I asked one of the waitresses at work if she'd help me out.
Rach? Can I talk to for just a minute? I-I dropped some socks.
Ok, but if something gets broken, and then the Queen comes over..
Ping pong? Honey, they have ping pong! Let's play!
'S'going pretty good, y'know? It's nice, and, we're having fun.
Did you also have his album, It's Not Easy Being Green?
Sweetie, you know I have no sense of humor when it comes to the wedding.
Hi. Uh, you... you don't know me, I'm Monica Geller... Ross's sister.
God, this is so hard. I can't decide between lamb or duck.
Oh, we used to drive each other crazy playing the shadow game.
I didn't even tell him to say that. . All right you're off my list.
Ugly Naked Guy's laying kitchen tile. Eww!
No, but she likes me. You abandoned her on a plane to Greece.
We ripped that couple apart, and kept the pieces for ourselves.
Ugh, they sent me home. They said I can't work if I'm sick.
Wait, what about the time I hit you in the face with the Silvian's pumpkin?
He says he wants to leave the country. He thinks you hate him.
It was great! It was great! How about you?! I mean you're having a baby!
Which we are, and-and we already paid for it. It's My Giant!
Well, this must've brought back some really bad memories for you, Ross.
Cute PJ's! You're really livin' it up here in London huh?
Excuse me, Mrs. Burkart? Well, we're all cleaned up in the kitchen.
Say it louder, I don't think the guy all the way in the back heard you!
Wait a minute, wait a minute. Yes he is. You are totally different.
Guys, rules are good! Rules help control the fun! Ohhh!
Yes, I will start with the carpaccio, and then I'll have the grilled prawns.
Oh that's so sweet! Look Chandler I don't care if you can't cry, I love you.
And then he told me he would run away with me, and he didn't.
I need two. I'm bringing Pete. My boyfriend. I have a boyfriend now!
No! Joey and Ross don't know anything and Chandler still thinks that Phoebe's pregnant.
Michelle! Of course, it was Michelle! Did it sound like Michelle?
I can't belive it, I'm gonna be an aunt. I'm gonna have like a nephew.
Look what I found in the drawer... And you said I'd never wear this...
Ok, you're being wierd. Do you want sex or did you do something bad?
Well, next time your massaging him, you should try and distract yourself.
Carol called me to thank me for the lasagna, I asked, she told me.
Oh! It was our pleasure. We are so much enjoying getting to know you.
Where's Benny? There he is! Where's Benny, there he is.
Oh Ross, sometimes grown-ups have commitments they just can't get out of!
Okay, please be careful with that. It was my grandmother's. Be careful.
Oh Rachel don't, don't you dare, don't, don't. Tell him I cook.
I'm guessing your new girlfriend wouldn't urinate on my coffee table.
Do you think things would have been better if you'd just told her the truth?
Yes, I want to change. And why-why don't you go down and get us a table?
'Cause I ran into him at the bank, he is still soo cute.
No! You don't know the system! There'll be nobody messing with the system!
I got one. "Socks. Because your family's feet deserve the best."
No, but... I saw the previews. They played it right before Jackass.
You are so sweet to notice! Yes, I lost three and a half pounds!
Hey Rach, the tampons here are only a penny. Let's stock up.
And Phoebe is his friend, so he thinks that would be breaking the rules!
I know! I know! And he totally freaked out and I can't find him anywhere!
Op, can I just tell you something? Very flattered but umm, I'm engaged.
Hey, we would still be living here if hadn't gotten the question wrong!
Dr. Greene. Oh my God it's Rachel's dad. What're you doing here?
I'm Catwoman, who wants to borrow the dress when you're too big for it.
Now another way to organise your stuffed animals, is by size.
Y'know, I-I... I have to figure...some st-Y'know, some stuff before I can...
Oh no, she's still at work, but she told me to tell you to call her.
Have a seat. Okay, listen umm, Chandler and I are going to live together, here.
Because they don't know we're dating. Do you think we should eat in the kitchen?
Were not doing anything. Were just sitting around talking, quietly.
I just thought that if I could follow the wire I could find out what it did.
Well maybe I'm ready now. I mean, it's a little scary, but maybe it's right.
Phoebe! Come on! Let's go! Come on! Why aren't you dressed yet?!
Wendy, we had a deal! Yeah, you promised! Wendy! Wendy! Wendy!
Oh, honey, I forgot. I promised Treeger that we'd leave our keys.
What does he think? Does he think I'm just gonna wait around for nothing?
You'll be fine. Nah, you won't, but I'll be back in two minutes.
What I said was, was that I understood. Joey's the one who agreed with you!
Ah, come on, sneakers are easy. You wear sneakers all the time.
We're gonna pick up the wedding dress then we're gonna have lunch with mom.
Ooh! I'm sorry! I think, I THINK, that may have missed the table!
I don't know. Hey, Rachel, you want the big plate? I want you to have the big plate.
Okay, the red ones are my guests and the blue ones are yours.
What if my own baby hates me? Huh? What am I gonna do then?
Wow! All right well, I mean, what can you do? If you lost it you lost it.
This is so great! This is exactly how we set the plates at the restaurant.
You should feel great about yourself! You're doing this amazing independence thing!
Yeah! Oh and interesting because I found the cameras in one of our bags!
Ohh, he's really shy. I-I don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet.
I still don't get why Greg and Jenny would give us a fake number.
'Cause, Gary and Phoebe think they're a hotter couple than we are!
Wow. My brother never even told me when he lost his virginity.
STOP IT!! ...Oh my God. It's true! Who am I?
Come on, that was back in high school! How could that still bother you?
I know, but y'know, this time you're gonna definitely know whether or not you did it!
Oh, hang on, hang on. Does Aunt Monica get a say in this?
Who's so brave, you're so brave, yes you are, you're so brave.
Okay. We have got to beat them! {Here we go yet again.}
Nothing. Just something I want to get Phoebe's opinion on for Valentine's Day.
Just a little but...it's just so scary! I don't even know what I would sing...
You are going to make a joke about my special present! Why would you do that?!
I don't see him. Hey! Maybe he's in the sugar bowl! Joey? Nope!
Okay, I'm never gonna wear them again. I just didn't get a chance to say goodbye.
Yeah! But, he can't not exactly see Emily, I mean that's his wife.
Hey, you know I got a question for ya. Just a little thing, no pressure.
I'm telling you, she went to the airport, and she's gonna go for it with Ross!
Thank you. It was so beautiful. I'm going to go to Joeys and get the pies.
Okay, one more, please. Come on, I'm gonna get it in this time, I will.
Not the way they're doing it. What, what happened? How did she die?
I don't know. I mean, I guess having sex in front of a baby isn't so...
Uhm, she has been showing us houses outside of the city.
You want a job? Turn off "Oprah," and send out a resume!
No, it doesn't say where it came from. Where would we return it?
Now there you go! I wouldn't want my best guest to strain her eyes!
Hey, thank you. Thank you so much. . You are SO going to Heaven!
Yeah, it's just we don't think of you as really being so much "with the words".
Well, we... "bore false witness"... See I could be a reverend.
Oh good, another dinosaur story. When are those gonna become extinct?
Aren't you afraid that Joey's going to figure all of this out? I heard it.
No! no! Let's figure out a fair way to decide who's staying.
Ross has never checked out of a room a minute before he had to.
Hey Maureen! Gosh! Hey uh, Chandler? This is my cousin Maureen.
Uh, so anyway, we thought one of you could read something during the ceremony.
Well yeah, but, you know, uh, 27 is a dangerous eye age.
Well, he did manage to keep his identity secret for a long time.
Oh, look! Acting for Beginners! Want to feel good about yourself?
Well, they're just gonna have to wait aren't they? I've only got two hands!!
Ok, alright, you guys, you'd better sit down, this is pretty big.
Joey, did you even interview this woman before you asked her to move in?
Because... I'm Monica Geller. It was my credit card you were using.
Wow, Monica! What an amazing opportunity to influence... dozens of people.
What did the doctor say? Any news on when the baby will come?
I want you to meet someone really special. Phoebe, this is Erica. And this is the baby!
Joey, we had a deal. That-that's why you're here! I've got to fire you!
Wait! Wait! Wait! You can't start today! Today's the rehearsal dinner!
All right. Have you said, "I love you?" You could say, I love you.
Phoebe I think he would notice if you didn't have a baby in nine months!
Well, we thought we would all go to a picnic , in Central Park!
Well, do you think he was waiting 'til after you left, so he could cry?
Look, I-I'm never gonna let you up so you may as well just go away.
Come on, okay, come on this is for all womankind. Let's kill 'um!
Come on! Come on, I was kidding! It was such an obvious joke!
The guy who made these hates feet and wants to see them die!
Oh that's cute! We really all enjoyed it. But y'know, it doesn't count.
There's something that we wanna tell you. We decided to name the girl-baby Erica.
Umm, listen I am sorry, but I'll put some out first thing in the morning.
Got it! Got it! Got it! Got it! Got it! Got it!
What does the red X next to Bob Greenmore's name mean?
It's harder for me! I have those four other women to compete with!
Two it is. Ok, time for bed, I'm gonna go brush my teeth.
It's goin' great. Right on schedule. Got my little happy helpers.
So that marriage stuff that you were saying yesterday, you don't really believe that do you?
Probably some y'know, European good-bye thing he picked up in London.
Oh, is that why you did it the secret hallway where nobody ever goes?!
Oh no no no no... this is dangerous territory. Keep it clean!
Oh, that's because I had lunch with Rich-Me neither! Okay, what do I want now?
Y'see, this is where you'd use that 'hello' word we talked about.
No, he didn't! He pretended to be a Quaker to get out of Korea.
Oh, then you do know it. So um what kind of things do you write about?
Oh my God, he's gonna do it now. Please, I cannot watch this, let's go.
Okay, I'll rest. But y'know if I'm going to bed, then you're coming with me.
It's gonna be weird to watch some actor pretending to be Ben's dad.
We don't have much time. Once the egg descended the oviduct ...
Phoebe, it's okay that you don't want me to be your girlfriend because I have the best boyfriend.
I'm telling-If you put that in her apartment you'll never hear the end of it.
Hey Rach, come on! We're gonna be late for the eye doctor appointment!
I-I am serious, I mean, we're, we're all over each other all the time.
No I didn't, I said kiwi lime. That's what makes it so special.
Alright, here we go. We've got salmon roulettes and assorted crudites.
Wow! A star! I know you all hate me and-and I'm sorry, but I don't care.
All right, that's it. You know what? Just get out of my way and stop moping.
So, I'm, I'm probably still ovulating. Do you want to give it another try?
All right shut up for a second and let me just see something. Oh, wow!
Hey, hold on there, tiger. How's it going? How you holding up?
That's it. I'm done. I don't care when the baby comes, no more betting.
Oh that's my doodle of a ladybug, with a top hat. She's fancy.
Vomit tux? Who vomited on-y'know what, what you up to Joe?
No, no really. I.. I wouldn't feel right about it. Just some water.
Oh my God! Did you hear that? She hired me because she thinks I'm good.
OK, great. You'll tell us and we'll laugh. Let's play poker.
I'm gonna leave some cards here. Please think of us for you next event.
No, my eye doctor is Richard! I can't go to him when I don't have a boyfriend!
When you were reading the dirty magazines without taking off the plastic!
Oh my God! Joey, what did you do after you threw her leg on the fire?
Oh, Nancy Thompson from Phoebe's old massage place is getting fired.
Oh that's okay. Don't worry about it, you can give it to me when we get back.
But what if it is better than ours? Should we at least look?
Yes! All right, y'know what? Why don't we start with a practice run? Okay?
Oh no! My parents have never seen me drunk! That they know of.
Oh, you came to tell him you love him! I knew it! I was right! I'm right, right?
: sweetie it's ok, I still love you, let me be a part of this.
...in this day and age how dumb do you have to be to get pregnant?
Wow! Play that message for Emily and this whole problem goes away!
Oh my God! No wonder I get such great service at Cafe Maurice.
Yeah, like I don't know, maybe you have a work problem that you need his advice on.
Wait wait wait. I was at home the whole time. How did I missed that?
Sure! It doesn't mean anything! Just like I know it doesn't mean anything with you!
You have to help me! I'm supposed to be writing my vows and all I have is this!
Joey, this is sick, it's disgusting, it's, it'snot really true, is it?
Yeah, and I wanted her to get to know the doctors and get settled into the hotel.
