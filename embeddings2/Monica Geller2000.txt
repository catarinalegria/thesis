So then you know?
I think he's shy.
Ross, don't start.
That is never good.
I've still got it!
Isn't that great?
Don't touch me!
You just stay here!
Oh, this is so great.
What if I asked?
The only problem!
You can not do this.
You and me both.
How did it go?
Phoebe moved out.
Anybody tell you?
I'll be right back.
I'll be right there!
Do you not see it?
I love you too Chandler.
Me and Chandler?!
I'm sorry but...nothing.
You really liked it?
How did that happen?
We got some time.
You dated her!
That is not true!
Oh my God, Richard.
Erica, are you okay?
That's a good idea.
That is so sweet!
I'm not touching you.

Take me home!
Oh, you're a grandpa.
We're gonna have sex.
What did you just say?
They're nice guys.
Isn't this great?
Ok, then just go.
Isn't that cute?
What, forget it!
No, no, I don't.
Joey, you don't have too!
So, did you do it?
But... you suck!
Not even close.
Rachel, this is yours.
Phoebe, what are you doing?
Do you all promise?
What were we thinking?
Well, what did you do?
There's our star!
It's pretty clear.
Rachel, you and Mark?!
Can I talk now?
We'd love too.
Phoebe, that is awful!
No! I'm not okay!
Oh, you look so great.
We have a ladle.
Joey, what are you doing?
Make a wish?
Oh, c'mon in.
You're an opthamologist.
And I can't stop you.
You look great too.
You did? How?
How was that possible?
Why did you do that?
Phoebe, what's the matter?
I pick you, Phoebe.
I'm crying here!!
Oh, gosh, I'm sorry.
Oh, we have some...
No time for that!
Not any more.
Do you hear something?
Put it out!!
Why would you do that?
Mom, it's OK.
I know honey, I'm sorry.

That's very funny!
Aww! I love you!
Y'know what's weird?
Don't you just love it?
Here's your key

Does so count!
There was nudity!
And it's a magnet!
She said WHAT?
It's Joey's birthday.
All right, come here!
I need to talk to you.
I can't promise anything.
That other play?
We owe you?!
Oh, put him on!
Well, what's the part?
Yeah, we'll be okay.
What was that bam?
Oh God, I'm so sorry.
Yes, it's twins!
It's gonna be so great.
I'm really not deciding!
It's okay, it's okay.
You're not a senior?
We said six!
What's wrong Phoebe?
After the snap!
She's still mad.

Chandler what do you say?
Sometimes we were.
I guess, in time.
He is so amazing.
Is there a problem?
Oh yeah? When?
You didn't find her?
That is so unfair!
So what do you think?
Oh, this is so hard.
Oh. What's wrong?
Well, what's the job?
You don't have the guts.
Thank you, Pheebs!
It wasn't fun?!
Well put it back.
Because it's my apartment!
Phoebe, wait a minute!
Ross, that is gorgeous!
You're not on TV.
So, let's do this.
I can't believe we're here.
What about my questions?
Here you go sweetie.
Chandler gets pedicures!
He took off?
I know it is the best.
I'm not talking to her!
And you're cute too.
Great!! That's great!
Make it fifty!
Here we go again.
Where's your bed?
Come on, hurry!
I don't want a beer.
I don't want a cat!
Oh, dear god!
We are pretty good.
I'm, I'm really sorry.
Could you not look?
He could hear me.
You have other friends?
Do you have a plan?
What was her name?
Was he crying?
Grab my ass!
Oh! Me too!
Joey, we know that's you.
What? When was this?
Now, that you can do.
Phoebe did the signs!
: hey Joey.
Hey. Where's Joey?
Oh, you're so wonderful.
We'll talk later.
Where ya going?
"See you around?"
Weren't you nine?!
You need one too?
Well do you love him?
My brother, Ross.
Why is it sick?
Not Chandler, just Joey.
They were lovers.
What if they don't?
And Monica knows...
Okay. Here's the thing.
What's with the guitar?
That you're a liar.
Honey, what's the matter?
Honey, we gotta go!
This was your idea?
This is so huge.
Okay, dinner's ready!
How is that gonna happen?
No, sorry sweety..
What? I don't see anything.
It's because I'm scrappy.
Honey, both yours.
Oh yeah. Definitely.
Oh God! I gotta go!
Phoebe, don't get upset!
So we're back on?
Oh, that's too bad.
You sold me out.
Oh my God! Oranges!
Kinda. Oh my God!
I just... can't do it.
She's asleep. Chandler?
What about your breath?!
We're not doing anything.
We both do that!
Hi! There you are.
Ross, there he is.
So we do Supergirl.
Not any more!
Mmmm! It's good!
Shut up, Joey!
Are you still awake?
What's goin' on?
What are you talking about?
Wow, is that Michelle?
Joey, you had the night!
Oh, I already have one.
Okay, did you hear that?
That was me and Ross.
I don't think there's anything.
Make me rich!!
It could be Amanda!
Oh, I fell asleep.
Okay, this one I like!
Because they made me.
Joey that is horriable.
No, I'm-I'm serious!
Oh sweet Lord.
What are you up too?
I can't go to lunch!!
Oh! You're awake!
And it's so clean!!
Yeah. Mine too.
I love you, Pete!!!
Hate that guy!
What-what-what's that now?!
It's Fun Bobby.
Hey, what's going on?
Well, it's getting late.
The fake kind!
How ya feelin'?
You are married though.
What the hell is this?
I hope she's OK.
Oh God. I'm so sorry.
You are just the sweetest.
Have you seen Chandler?
That's not totally true.
You can't marry him!
Hi, come on in.
I punched you...?
Hmm, bite me.
Can I adopt you?
Ohh. Oh! Ohh!
Yeah! I think that's great!
I gave you one job!
And listen to this...
I'm not sure about this.
I don't know why I'm here.
I'm so happy for me.
Joey that is so sweet.
You keep saying that.
I'm really gonna miss you.
See you guys later.
It sounds interesting!
You're meeting Richard?
I really wanna have a baby.
Ohh that's sweet!
Rachel always cries!
Ohh! Yeah, I forgot.
Joey, do you work here?
Why would we do that?
Oh, yeah, that's true.
Chandler, I think I'm sick.
Yeah. Where were you?
What did you tell them?
Ohh, how is he?
Yeah, Ginger something.
It doesn't say that!
I don't think I'd care.
Over here dad.
No, give me the...
I think you're my favorite.
No! You have lasagnas!
Oh. Hi, Mr.Heckles.
One two three.
What?! What are you doing?!
Joey, what's going on?
Wait! What about Joey?
Would you please go?
Aww, not right now.
Oh my god, then...
No no no no.
What's the big deal?
That's just good sense!
Sorry we're late.
The head tilt?
You don't have any stuff.
Oh my God! Oh my God!
I'm kidding! I'm kidding!
Oh boy me too!
Phoebe, is this the recipe?
Oh, honey, the earrings...
So sexy. Honey.
Really?! How much?!
You know what? You're right.
I know! I know! I know!
Well Rachel's not here!
How did work go?
Watch the thorns!
Well, thanks anyway.
No I told you I can't.
Okay, I'm not getting this!
Hey. Whaddya doing?
Oh, that'd be great.
Are you okay, sweetie?
Okay. I love you so much.
Hey umm, what's this?
Oh my God! What happened?
What have I not told you?
Oh, so who won?
...Yeah. Yeah, I do.
Hey! Good luck!
Hey! Where's Mike?
My surprise party!
What? We could do it!
Phoebe, that stuff is...
Joey! You're doing great!
Oh, that's sounds great.
Then what's the problem?
Okay, Chandler, you go first.
Thanks. I think you got it!
I think I need a drink.
Hey, where is everybody?
What did he tell you?
Umm, well, he's...
Go! Go! Go!
Shh!! Wait, what?
Dad, I'm the twinkie.
I look like a man??
Don't you have to pee?
Oh THATS ME!
That's right, I got mine.
I thought you hated him?
Oh no, wait! Joey!
Hey! Happy Anniversary!
Hey! I didn't know either.
Anything but stew.
The three of us?
You really think this is okay?
I mean, was it Gina?
And six others.
And now your cell.
You have to go to London!
Are you sure you're okay?
D'you want to?
You don't need a shower.
What do you think you're doing?
W-wait. What is that?
He doesn't have anyone.
Alright, let's see..
Thank you so much Phoebe.
Guys! I'm not pregnant.
You bought a boat?
I don't have an atlas.
No! You can't do that!
Ooh, I want one...
Why is Ross naked?
It's good to see you too.
'Kay, here you go.
Fine, go have sex.
God, you are so strong.
Hey sweetie. Oh good.
Are you mocking me?
Somebody likes you!
Hey how was dinner?!
Okay! Ohhh no!
I'm going to get bigger!
So how was Joan?
Hey, where have you been?
The oven is on.
Joey. Erica, baby!
Uh, wait, backstage?
Are these the shoes?
So glad you came!
Can we come in?
You have to tell David!
Okay, I'm up! I'm up!
What the hell happened?!
Don't touch her!!
Nope, she's perfect.
What is the big deal?
Give it. Give it.
All right, you're hired!
Oh, then go Vassar.
Run, Phoebe, run!
Oh yeah right there!
Give me one more.
What?! Which one?!
Wow, this really sucks.
Oh my God! You're good!
Hi...May I help you?
I can't! I have to work!
Honey, what's going on?
That's not even a game!
I lost our mattresses.
But she liked us.
Are we still on that?
In like a half-hour?
Really you can do that?
I drew you a bath!
What can we do for you?
Can you blame him?
You think this is clever?
Oh, that's great! Congratulations!
What happened to Janine?
I'm not always that bad!
Alright, we have to talk.
Chandler, what were you thinking?
Oh my God! I love that!
Hey! How'd it go?
Yeah, no, me neither.
Hey, you wanna see something?
What is going on with you?
This bottle opener.
I know, it is isn't it?
Light still out?
I saved you a seat.
No, she's out shopping.
Another good point.
OH! Oh, oh!
To use the bathroom.
What kind of changes?
Hey! Don't be a baby!
Oh, okay. No problem.
Hey, have you seen Rachel?
You dropped it off?
I do not like that woman!
So far so good!
Oh-my-god Rachel! Rachel!
Rach? What are you doing?
We can't afford that.
Oh my-Oh good God!
No, I really, really do.
Good for you, Joey.
What did they do to you?
Joey, promise me something.
I was frustrated with you!
Again, you're welcome.
Would you just open it?
Star in a movie.
Lots of responses.
How did you get in here?
Oh, she's gonna love that!
I hear wedding bells.
Ow! Ow! Ow!
That was a good day!
I never knew that either.
Oh my God! I love him!
And you're not gonna do that.
Okay, okay. I hate this.
What are you guys gonna do?
Are you really gonna do this?
...I can imagine.
Damn! It's empty!
Oh, honey, that's incredible!
What? I didn't say anything.
Eldad, this is Rachel.
I'll take care of it.
I bet this will work!
Oh... How are they?
You don't even know me...
Happy birthday dad.
What is she talking about?
You're Lewis Posin.
He hates to lose.
So, what's your name?
Oh give it a rest!
I've been pretty good!
Ooh, and I can do this.
Oh May 15th.
Congratulations!/Good for you!/Great!
Huh, wanna bet?
Rachel, that's all we do.
I love this friend thing!
It's like two miles!
Well, you're-you're sweating.
That's Bill Clinton.
Uh-oh, it was bad?
I have nothing to say to you.
I am. I'm that stupid.
Uh, we're gonna be great.
Nancy doesn't smoke!
Yes, you are so smart!
Joey, that is not gonna work.
The sun is out!
So what're you gonna do?
Ha! My point!
Have you seen Chandler?!
Yes you did. Absolutely.
What's that supposed to mean?
Where were your parents?
Oh my God, Rachel! Hi!
Okay. That was her right?
'I am Bea.'
I-I-I think you look great.
He asked you out?!
Thank you soo, much.
All right then. Bye.
So what's Phoebe like?
Give me the good stuff.
Oh my god good?
Not now, I'm sick!
Yeah, in-in-in the bathroom.
It's gonna be so hot!
You really ok with it?
That was a long night.
Well, what were you gonna say?
I really need to talk to you.
This is so much fun!
What's hard to believe?
Yeah, I'll have a scotch...
Hey, I know I what I want!
A couple of days.
Are you guys gonna be okay?
Know when to stop.
Oh and you know what I want!
What took you so long?
Mine? Right here?
No, space doody!
Them?! Who's them?
You're not supposed to look!
No, that seems about right.
What? Who says that?
Waaay too special.
Man's got a point.
What was the dream about?
All right, be my guest.
Uh-oh, what's the matter?
How does she do that?
You flicked me first.
That's not even a word!
I'm just easing you in.
No, I haven't seen him.
Ok, here, watch this.
No, I will not cave.
We're just making conversation.
Y'know, I never saw that.
I think we found a place.
Yeah, I thought it was cute.
Go ahead Rach.
Um... hi there.
Yeah, thanks. You know what?
Well no, but um.
God Ross, what is that?
Very good, so good.
You have got to go home!
Why would I have the keys?
Honey, you don't have to do this.
And who laminated it?
Eh, you work for that.
You used to have carpet.
He's... our age.
I know. I just can't find...
Phoebe, I did not have sex.
Oh, why is it unfair?
Ooh, Phoebe, you look great!
And his puppet too.
Would you look at them?
What's Phase Two?
I can't believe you bought this.
That's how old you are.
You'd better run!
Son of a bitch!
Thank you. They're yours.
How-how did that happen?
Did she really say that?
What? It's still going on.
No, I just talked to them.
How's it going with her?
Joey, speed it up!
So I'm kissing everyone?
I paid to have this done.
Well what did you send?
Why do I have to decide?
I'm not your best friend?
Guys, what's going on?
You didn't know that already?
This doesn't feel weird!
Is it a good play?
Just waiting for you sweetie.
Why is everything different?
These are for Erica!
Here, let me try.
Well, it matters to me!
No, not here. Maybe here.
What are you supposed to be?
Alright, alright, alright...
I mean really, think about it.
You said that was sexy!
Who's Mr. Girabaldi?
I'm gonna miss you so much.
Phoebe! Phoebe, open up!
I'm getting married next!!
That's insurance fraud.
Why don't you just call her?
What is the worse part?
So, how'd it go?
Yeah, well, is that better?
Okay, here's your penis!
So what'd he say?
Well you should be embarrassed.
Okay, umm, you're a loon.
We won't. 300?
Ross didn't scare you?
Oh no no no no!
But my clothes are-ohh!
So do them for free.
But we can go, right?
Oh no! What's the matter?
Just subtract twelve.
Everybody get your toys!
What the hell are you doing?!
He took my snack!
I thought she just had one.
Ooh, this always happens.
You're a really good kisser.
Did you just flick me?
Hey, it's good to see you!
Okay. Ow!!!!! Ow-oh-oh!
How who wears it?
That can't be your father.
Ah, the other Jack.
Hey! Did you find them?
Joey's bare ass!
Oh, god help us.
Oh, here's a great one.
You have dinosaur checks?
Happy New Year.
Aww, honey I'm sorry.
Chandler, why would you do that?
Rachel locked the door.
Put your head back.
What are you guys doing here?
No. I hate this part.
In...in two weeks.
Wow! You are really fast!
Fine! Happy Anniversary!
It's so good, isn't it?
Hey! You're wearing pants!
What are you trying on now?
Hey! So what do you think?
Hey, let me tell them!
Jeez! What is with you?
Alright, I'll be right back.
The thing we never do.
Hello, Mr. Heckles.
Let's go big bunny!
But we love our house.
I mean don't you trust her?
Wait, you like them with me.
Do you wanna go hunting?
How do you know a mugger?
Not at these prices.
Who are you talking too?
One Two Three...
That sounds like Nana.
All right, check me out.
No, here's your mail.
The best man? Wow!
Well, maybe you don't need them.
No. See you don't understand.
Oh no-no-no, it's still me.
Well, bye for me too.
All right, what's going on?
I'm changing out of this.
Yeah, I'd really like to.
We only ordered one!
Regular or decaf?
No that's, that's okay.
Clearly we were wrong.
Joey, you have to talk to her!
Oh my God! That's wild!
Well, apparently she does.
There were only twelve.
Who's David Lynn?
Come on, no peeking!
Bye sweetie, I love you.
OK, um. Goodbye.
Yeah, that's a big step.
It's clearly an Emma.
Yes! Have you seen it?
Y'know what, I like Kathy.
I am, aren't I?
Yeah. Don't do the dance.
Chandler, sense the tone!!
Pheebs, how's it going?
Oh no, we can't walk!
Oh my God, that's Charlie!
I'm so glad you liked it.
Can I ask you a question?
They hurt so much!
This is all of your things.
We were playing a game.
...What did I ask?
I wanna wear this everyday.
So, are you ready to go?
We're switching rooms.
You didn't hear the speech!
Phoebe, you are a bad ass!
I don't feel good right now.
Phoebe, it's not about quantity.
No really, they're OK.
And he's a great brother!
Then why are you laughing?
Now, open your eyes.
It's Chandler! Are you OK?
They've arrested Monica.
Yeah, but without the costumes.
Barry who you almost...?
Why did you hire me?
Chandler! What are you doing here?
Well, what about his family?
I'm engaged!!!!!! I'm engaged!!!!
Well, thanks, we like him.
Who the hell are you?!
Hi, nice to meet you!
What's wrong with PBS?
It's very interesting, Phoebe.
I am not high maintenance!
Who, who are they?
Worked like a charm.
I thought that was a good thing.
Let's get the show on it!
Okay, what's going on with you?
Well, I was having a conversation.
When were we not friends?
Well, I hope you're happy!
Gotta keep squishing.
You did a minute ago!
Was it really that good?
I would love to do it together!
Well you did a little bit.
What's with all this sand?
And that's Pete's Mom.
Um, Pennsylvania Dutch.
About nineteen pounds.
Ugh, I thought you were Rachel!
Wh-wh-what are you doing here?
That's not 'til Thursday.
I'm not gonna go out with him.
It's hard for some people!
No-no, don't-don't-don't do it!
Yeah? The work problem?
Phoebe, where's your purse?
Well, you're not working either.
Ross, thats my jacket.
Oh yeah, what's the plan?
Y'know what? You are right?!
I got you the foot massager.
Does anybody want these?
That doesn't seem fair.
I can't believe you didn't tell me.
We're with you. We got it.
Thunder being stolen!!
It's Monica, open up!
Y'know maybe a little bit!
Look at you with all the guys!
And Rachel. And that's Chandler.
Yeah! She's right in there!
Alright, 5 more minutes.
Hello. Oh, hey Ross!
How did you get in there?!
Chandler, why are you doing this?
Hey, Rach, how was work?
Hell, I wanna see Joey.
I can't believe it! I lost!
I...I have to fire him.
What else did you think about?
Oh, wait a minute honey.
So how does it look?
Yeah, I'm sorry. I really am.
Now calm down Joey.
I'll pick it up for you!
It's almost our anniversary!
Then why are you smoking?
Ow. Ow. Ow.
Look at you. All jealous.
Come on Rach, let's go.
The good stuff, huh?
Oh, now you want a pad.
Hey Phoebe! Guess what?
This is my favorite part.
He is right, isn't he?
You kissed another woman!
How about Mockolate mousse?
No, just a Friday night.
Hey, you've got a boyfriend!
Oh, none for me. Thanks.
Alright, you wanna feel better?
Well actually, Ross doesn't.
There's the man I married!!
Wow! You made a profit!
Is it the Italian guy?
How was your first day?
What is wrong with you?!!!
I never stop thinking about it.
You want some help with that?
Well, she saw the ring.
Never done that before.
Oh, I'm- I'm so sorry!
Yes, he is. Me.
You don't know military time?
Oh my God. Richard? Hi!
It's for their own good.
You can, I know you can!
I do not have baby fever!
Joey, we have something to tell you.
Awww. But still no.
Yes, you're having a boy!
No Phoebe I am mad!
I know. Closing credits.
His indian name?
Hi, glad you could come.
And who pays for that?
So, did I hear Poconos?
Rachel said everything was okay.
Well, I-I-I-I... I don't know...
I highly doubt that.
Two thousand dollars?
Yes! Okay! Okay! Wait-wait-wait!
From here to the airport?
All right? What's going on?
You really think that'll work?
