Much as you are.
You are just like Jack.
They are gonna love me.
Oh my God Ross!!

It's like watching porn!
Oh my God!-Eh! Well...
That's it. Just relax.
I got me some drinks!
All right, you know Paolo?
You don't play the oboe!
Well, this is very generous!
It's a Thanksgiving miracle!
Oh, I missed you so much!
Was it not pain-free?
Oh no! Oh! Wow!!!
Fine! Fine! Oh-oh!
Did you find the dress?
So, you're like a zillionaire?
Well, it felt French.
I'd call that excessive.
Great! Okay, good for you!
No, I think we killed it.
Oh-oh, that's your thing.
Okay, maybe ask this guy.
Thank you so much for this.
She wasn't a hooker.

I don't even have a 'pl'.
What are you talking about?!
Oh. Aw, forget it.
I did not see that coming.
Ok, I'll walk you out.
Which one do you have?
Tell him, tell him.
Okay, let's talk outside.
Wher-where have you been?

I think it went into me.
All right. Bye bye.
Why is Ross doing that?
I don't what your talking about.
Trick or treat!
You're not serious, right?
I'll pull you through.
Maybe this is too weird.

Oh my God, are you guys okay?
Well, do you think I should propose?
All right, so let's switch.
And the big one's for me!
Why are you lying to him?
I ordered Chinese food.
I didn't see this on the menu.
Ross, I know what you're thinking.
Sex in his chair.

Yeah, okay, let's talk it out.
Ooh, oh, Rachel, don't look.
No, there's no dog here?
Oh wait, my grandmother's dead.
Oh, I hear divorce bells.
Alright, what are we gonna say?
Don't get me started on that.
Well, so do a lot of people.

Huh. Okay, Mr. Perkazet.
Okay, bye-bye! Good trip!
Well, you know that psychic I see?

Hey, have you guys seen Monica?
What-what are you talking about?!
What?! What else did you do?
Ross, where did you get this?!
So how long have you known?
Okay, I'll be out in a second.
Uh huh. Why is that?
Seriously, what-what's the part?
Oh no, she won't tell us.

Hey, everybody. Happy Thanksgiving!
Oh, okay. Hi new dad.
Oh wait, oh no. Wait.
Oh my god! Where are you?
He just got a divorce right?
Hey! Ooh, did you do it yet?
You're Frank's best man?!
I don't want it to end either.
Do you not know each other?
Do you have my birth certificate?
Yeah, is there a hair on it?
We know about your party Joey.
Oh! We could have done that.
Hey! Joey! Hey! Hey!! Wow!
That would be great. Thank you.
But you guys came so close.
Broke them all, huh?
See there it is right there.
Both it is, thank you.
Oh hey Joey! What's up?
Oooh, I like that, "daddy"
I don't want to hear about her!!
Maybe they don't trust us.
Well, if you think it will help.
Sure it does. Yeah, yeah.
Ha. Ha, ha.
Ahh, his work is done.
And-and a power tie?
God, I wish Mike were here.
It's okay. How's the soup?
Hey, are Ross and Rachel back?
So you're not homesick yet?
Whatever! What about you Meg?
What? Oh, are you pregnant too?!
No, I can spot you from here.
She's right! You have to stop!
Ugh, what's right with them?
You told me you hate massages!
Please...wait, how did you do that?
Yeah Joey that is so gross!
Um, not even a little bit.
All the time when you're cooking.
I know. I know, what's her number?
Okay, then maybe I can come too!
Ross, please! My make-up!
I don't ever want to see you again!
I'll run out and get you one.
Yeah I bet! Look out!
Mon! I'm so happy for you!
Buffay is spelled B-U-F-F-A-Y.
Okay, yeah, so it's not gonna work.
This is everybody. This is Ross.
Look at you all grown up.
My dear, sweet Rach.
Oh, is this the bug lady?
Rachel, what the hell is this?!
I wa-I wa-I wa...
London is stupid! Stupid!
You'd already broken up.
Oh, I didn't know you wanted her too!
Every little bit of you!
Let's run towards them!
It's all right. You can mourn.
Oh-okay, I get the game now.
Okay, thanks. Yeah, I'll try that.
But I don't. Me, Phoebe.
Can I tell you a little secret?
I'm still looking through mine...
Oh, you didn't have to come in with me.
So, did you pick one yet?
I knew I should have married Chandler.
Susan, he looks just like you.
Thank you, mister Bag.
That you don't stop talking about it.
You don't have any other choice!
Surprise! Look who's back!
Well, he made a move on me.
Wow? Really? That's fantastic!
I can't say because he's famous.
She was a drug dealer!
Hey. So, what did he say?
What is this? What's going on?
Alright, whadyou do with him?
Yeah. Not looking for dates.
Really?! 'Cause y'know that hurts.
Okay, I think we have a problem here.
Well, I taught me and I love me.
Anyway, I should go. Okay, bye.
You have got to be kidding me!
All right, so what were you thinking?
Hey Chandler, why so fancy?
Oh! What is that? What is that?
Oh, she's got gorgeous hair.
You know what, that's it, that's it.
Hm-mm, corn beef.
Hugh! Hugh Grant!
Merci. Au revoir.
Mexico! End credits.
Whoa, that's a lot of stuff.
So now what's going on here?
It's nice that he has someone.
Hey there, you handsome thing.
What? Wha-wha-wha-did you do ROSS!
But do you wanna get back together?
How could you possibly think that?
It's ok that's how you feel.
Thank you! And Happy Holidays.
That true, I am flaky.
Oh, all right. What did I have?
Going to the hospital tonight?
Well yeah, that and Chandler's problem.
Does Joey have any idea?
Oh, this one's for Chandler. Here.
Because I'm dumping him today.
Hey. So, did you talk to Rachel?
Fun Bobby is so great.
Y'know she has a face Ross!
Break my heart-Oh, all right.
Okay, but try and get Joey too.
My God! What did you order?!
It's in the cake, isn't it?
Is it an engagement ring?
That's the door. He's gone...
Okay, don't freak out. I'll go.
What?! No! It was my idea!
All right, what's going on there?
You didn't get the money, did you?
Oh we do, but not just yet.
Well, this is none of my business.
I am definitely gonna watch that!
That doesn't lock does it?
Yeah. What-what are you doing here?
There's sooo much you don't know.
I know. Hand me a tissue.
So? Did you get the annulment?
No! Joey, you're going to be great!
She is so great! I miss her.
Where? Ooh, come to Momma.
Oh good, I didn't miss the party.
What?! That's the first time today!
I-I'm with the umm, the 57th.
I'm, I'm breaking up with you.
Hey, hey, no, oh oh.
We should do something. Whistle.
Really?! Joey?! You don't say.
Um you, you got a minute?
You never run on a barge!
Yeah, yeah. You can do it to.
So, um, are you gonna call him?
Oh, look what we almost left.
Oh, whew, no, that's Bob.
I'm just taking it to be re-wired.
You can open your eyes now.
Or you can do volunteer work.
Wow, look at these prices.
Well I hope you have fun tonight.
Are you still mad at us?
Yeah! That was so weird, huh?
Is it a meatball sub?
Nooo! Why would you think that?
Who cares, it got you here.
Wow! Oh well, I will be there!
That's a, that's a long time.
Chandler, I found the perfect ring.
Now, have you told anyone else?
Well, what period is it from?
Wow! That is a bad audition.
