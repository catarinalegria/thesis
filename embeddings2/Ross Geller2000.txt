Just ignore them.
Give me the bag.
Really? Which one?

Of Ross and Rachel.
Oh, forget it, okay?
It was you, pal.
It was just a kiss.
That is so unfair!
Do you feel better?
All right, there you go!
Really?! We are?
Umm, she kissed me.
But I didn't want to.
Okay, good-good for you.
I am very...very sorry.
I don't know Rachel, why?

Oh, now you want a favour?
Nope! Something else.
He didn't get the goggles!
No, I don't want to hit you.
Yeah! Se vice?

Actually it's more like this.
Well, the stuff I just mentioned.
Yeah, what, what was I thinking?
You know where Joey is?
Come on, two on one.
Oh! What a game, huh?
Probably around gonorrhea.
He looks so tiny.
Don't make jokes now.
Oh man, this is hilarious.
What's wrong? Are you okay?
Hey Pheebs, what are you doing?
Try the bottom one.
No, no-no, Ross Geller.
So, for the whole weekend?
I can't believe you hated me.
Well I, I don't know. Why?

E-except, except that what?
It was a dry day.
No! That's-that's my arm!
Hey, there is uncle Joey!
