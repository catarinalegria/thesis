Oh. Well uh, you not being able to talk may make this easier. Listen umm... Listen I don't wanna be someone who comes between two best friends. I just, I can't stand seeing what this is doing to you guys, and I don't wanna be the cause of that. So, I don't think we can see each other anymore. I'm gonna go to my mom's in Chicago, I'm gonna stay there for awhile. I think this could've be something really amazing, but y'know this is probably for the best. Y'know? I'm gonna miss you. Good-bye, Chandler.
I'm so excited about having Monica come on board with us. Although I do feel bad about having fired chef Emillio, it's like losing a member of the family. Of course, that literally is the case for several of you. Tony, Carlos, Marie, please, tell your father how much we're gonna miss him. Now, I know that Monica has a lot of great ideas for this place, well, you all read the review. So without much further ado, I present to you our new head chef.
Not Sean Penn. Alright, I, I've got a funny one, alright. My last girlfriend Tilly. Ok, we're eating breakfast, right, and I made all these pancakes, there was like 50 pancakes right. And all of the sudden she turns to me, alright, and she says, 'Eddie.' I say, 'yeah,' she says, 'Eddie, I don't want to see you anymore.' And it was literally like she had reached into my chest, ripped out my heart, and smeared it all over my life, ya know. And now there's like this incredible abyss, ya know, and I'm falling and I keep falling and I don't think I'm ever gonna stop. That uh, wasn't such a funny story, was it?
I thought that movie was so incredibly... boring. I mean, that thing at the end where the kid kills himself because he can't be in the play? What was that?! It's like, kid, wait a year, leave home, do some community theatre. I walked out of there and I thought, 'Now, that's two hours of my life that I'm never getting back.' And that thought scared me more than all the other crap I was afraid to do.
Honey, relationships are hard. Like with your Mom and me. You know after we graduated college we broke up for a while. It seems her Father, your Grandfather, wanted her to travel around Europe, like he did. Of course, he got to do it on Uncle Sam's nickel, because he was also strafing German troop trains at the time. However,
All right, look. I've gotta tell you something. I'm not 17. I only said so that you'd think I was cute and vunerable. I'm actually 30, I have a wife, I have a job, I'm your Congressman. Monica, this is ridiculous, we're great together. We can talk, we make each other laugh, and the sex. Oh, man, okay i have no frame of graft, but I thought that was great.
Oh! You're right. Oh God. But, before I can say 'good-bye', there's something I really need you to know, Chandler. The way I feel about you, it's like, I finally understand what Lionel Richie's been singing about. Y'know, I mean what we have, it's like movie love, you're my soulmate, and I can't believe we're not going to be spending the rest of our lives together.
Now, I know things've been weird lately, but you're like my oldest friend in the world... Except for maybe Laurie Schaffer, who I don't talk to anywhere, 'cause she's all bitter now that she lost the weight and it turns out she doesn't have a pretty face. ....Okay, I'm just gonna ask you this once, and I want a straight answer.
I don't know one actor worth his salt that didn't say at one time or another, "God, I stink!" Hell, I just did a scene out there, first take, I stunk the place up. But, the important thing you must remember, no matter how badly you think you might stink, you must never, ever bust into my dressing room and use my shower! Do you understand me?!
Uh, we've just gotten a call from Rachel, and she told us what Ross did. It's pretty appalling, and Ross, if you're listening, I don't wanna play your song anymore. Why don't we devote our time to a couple that stands a chance? Avery, Michelle's sorry she hit you with her car and she hopes you two will work it out.
That's alot of information to get in in thirty seconds! Alright Joey, if wanna leave, just leave. Rachel, no you weren't supposed to put beef in the trifle. It did not taste good. Phoebe, I'm sorry, but I think Jacques Cousteau is dead. Monica, why you felt you had to hide the fact that you were in an important relationship is beyond me.
I still love you. And I know I probably shouldn't even be here telling you this, I mean you're with Chandler a guy I really like, and if you say he's straight I'll believe you! After seeing ya the other night I knew if I didn't tell ya I'd regret it for the rest of my life. Letting you go was the stupidest thing I ever did.
I mean, I know what I'm talking about. I gave up two babies, and I only wish I had someone there that had given up babies, that could tell me how terrible it is to give up babies. I just think that, it would be something you will regret every single day for the rest of your life. So, how ever hard it is to give up this puppy, it would be like a million times harder to give up a child. I really shouldn't have given you the puppy first.
Oh, I see. Well, I'm just gonna put in a call here and we'll find out what's goin' on and straighten it out. Yeah, hi, Lori please. Hi darling. So how 'bout Joey Tribbiani for the part of the cab driver, isn't he terrific? Uh-huuuuh. Uh-huuuuh. OK, doll. Talk to you later. Yeah, you're gonna have to sleep with her.
Y'know, I just was finally happy y'know. For the first time in my life! After my Dad left me, and then, and then getting arrested for stealing those birds, and then, and then the whole punctured lung thing! I can, it's still really hard to take deep breaths in cold weather, but with Alice all that stuff kinda went away. And now it's, and now it's gone and I don't know why!
Hello, I'm looking for Bob. This is Jane. I don't know if you're still at this number, but I was just thinking about us, and how great it was, and, well, I know it's been three years, but, I was kinda hoping we could hook up again. I barely had t he nerve to make this call, so you know what I did?
Maybe it's crazy in a perfect world, a world without lab coats and blazers, but you not in a perfect world, you in a museum now. See that scientist in the classes, he and I used to play together all the time in grade school, but now... Peter! Hey, Peter! It's me Rhonda! From PS-129! I shared my puddin' which you man! I gave you my Snack Pack! See, he pretend he don't even here me!
I wish I could know if you'd heard any of that. I suppose I've either just told you I love you or given my neighbours a good laugh. Mrs. Newman if you're listening, bugger off this in none of your business. I suppose there's not much chance you did heard that, and there's the call waiting so, I should go. Oh well. Hello.
Oh, no-no-no, that's not rude! It's perfectly in keeping with a trip that I've already been run down by one of your wiener carts, and been strip-searched at John F. Kennedy Airport, apparently to you people, I look like someone who's got a balloon full of cocaine stuffed up their bum.
Okay, you know, one of two things is happening here. Either you're seeing somebody behind my back, which would make you the biggest jerk on the planet. Or, else you're pretending that you're seeing somebody, which just makes you so pathetic that I could start crying right here in the cereal aisle. So like which of these two guys do you want to be?
Me? I'm fine. Look, honey, in an ideal world, there'd be no her, and your father would look like Sting. And I'll tell you something else. Ever since that poodle-stuffer came along, he's been so ashamed of himself that he's been more attentive, he's been more loving... I mean, it's like every day's our anniversary.
Actually it's, it's quite, y'know, typical behaviour when you have this kind of dysfunctional group dynamic. Y'know, this kind of co-dependant, emotionally stunted, sitting in your stupid coffee house with your stupid big cups which, I'm sorry, might as well have nipples on them, and you're like all 'Oh, define me! Define me! Love me, I need love!'.
Hi! Phoebe, I'm Dr. Harad, I'm going to be delivering your babies. I want you to know, you're gonna be in good hands. I've been doing this for a long time. I'll be back in a minute to do your internal, in the meantime, just relax because everything here looks great. And also, I love Fonzie.
...so y'know, that's why, within a few years, that voice recognition is gonna be pretty much standard on any computer you buy. Y'know, so you could be like-like, 'Wash my car.' 'Clean my room.' It's not gonna be able to do any of those things, but it'll understand what you're saying.
Hello Ross? It's Emily. I know this is out of the blue but uh, I'm getting married tomorrow. Well, maybe I am. I keep thinking about you and I'm wondering if-if we made a mistake giving up so fast. Are you thinking about me? Of course you're not, but if you are, call me tonight. Okay, bye.
Well, I'm so sorry. I thought I was leaving you with the best parents in the world, I didn't even hear about your Mom and Dad til a couple of years ago, and by then you were already grown up. I don't know, you're here, and I would, I would really, I would like to get to know you.
Oh yeah? I work in a cubicle surrounded by people. I've been talking to you for five minutes now about killing myself and no one's even looked up from their desk. Hang-hang on. Hey everybody! Uh, I'm gonna kill myself! I'll get back to ya. I got nothing. Wait. Uh, hey Marge! Ehh, nothing. Nothing.
Right. But, see, the longer I waited, the more phenomenal the kiss had to be, and now we've reached a place where it's just gotta be one of those things where I just like... sweep everything off the table and throw you down on it. And, uh, I'm not really a, uh, sweeping sorta fella.
Terrific! Well uh, there's one more thing. Uhh, uh it's really important to the director that everything in this movie is authentic. Yeah and so in your love scene with Sarah she talks about how she's never seen a naked man who wasn't Jewish. So...
While most of us think of chocolate bunnies and baskets as traditional Easter gifts. Some people insist on giving live chicks as presents. Unfortunately, the sad fact remains that most of these little guys won't live to see the fourth of July. Because of as a result of improper care, they will be dead.
Let me tell you what I think might be going on. No-no-no, don't look at the table. Look at me. Okay, I think somebody asked someone to move in with them. And I think someone said, "Yes" but now she's having doubts because things are moving to fast for someone. Does that sound at all possible to you?
Welcome back to our fall telethon. Now if you've been enjoying the performance of Cirque Du Soleil, and you'd like to see more of the same kind of programming, it's very simple. All you have to do is call in your pledge and at that time tell the operator, one of our volunteers, what kind of programming you'd like to...
No, ma'am. Well, anyhoo, we should be getting our F.D.A. approval any day now, hopefully, in time for Thanksgiving. See, the way we look at it, chocolate already dominates most of your major food-preparation holidays: Easter, Christmas, what have you.
Let me tell you a story. When I set out to create Moss 865, do you think it just happened overnight? No. There was Moss 1, that burnt down my Dad's garage, there was Moss 2 that would only schedule appointments in January, and 862 others that I learned from, just like I learned from this fight, never to let a guy stand on my neck.
Phoebe, it's okay that you feel this way. I mean it is soon. And there's a lot of things we don't know about each other, and I just figure that everything I really like. And the things I don't know, I get to learn about at someplace with both our names on the mailbox.
Yeah, well, it scares me! I mean I not even divorced yet, Chandler. You know, you just invited me over here for pasta, and all of the sudden you're talking about moving in together. And, and I wasn't even that hungry. You know what, it's getting a little late, and I-I should just, um...
Well, I've been calling you, but it turns out I had your number wrong. And when I finally got the right one from Information, there was no answer. So I thought I'd just come down here, and make sure you were okay.
No. See now I don't think you're being fair. I mean one night you see me and you get scared, I mean, what about all the other nights when you don't see me, huh? What about last night when you went and got a drink of water and I was nice enough to hide behind the door, what's that about, huh?
Hi, it's me. Listen, Bob. I'm probably way out of line here. I mean, It has been 3 years, and you're probably seeing someone else now, but if we could just have one night together, just for old time's sake, one hot, steamy, wild night...
Yeah, well your friends are in violation of it. I've been a nice guy up until now, but uh, I don't need this grief. I'm gonna call the landlord and tell him that Monica is illegally subletting here grandmother's apartment. Your friends are outta here pal.
We can't find another place. Then we can't have the wedding! I've ordered chicken and salad and-and cake for 150. What should be the most wonderful day of my life is rapidly turning into just Sunday with a spectacular amount of food!
I understand completely, there's nothing more horrifying than embarrassing yourself in front of your in-laws. As a matter of fact, when I started dating Judy I was unemployed, and her father asked me what I did for a living and I told him I was a lawyer.
It's so great seeing you guys again. I'd like to make a toast. Uh, as a poet once said, "In the sweetness of friendship, let there be laughter and sharing of pleasures for in the due of little things the heart finds it's morning and is refreshed."
Well, relax. If it makes you feel better, I've attended some of the finest medical schools in Central America. Well then, let's take a look at this skin abnormality of yours. Come on, have a seat. Eeh, huh. As I suspected, it's a koondis!
Ross, are you there? Ross, I don't know if you can hear this but... I'm gonna talk anyway, uh, I'm in the States with you sister and your friends and it's all over with Colin. I came here to tell you that, and to tell you-Yes, Joey you can have all the chocolate you want, just take it! Uh, I came here to tell you that I love you.
No. Because I know how to write men that women fall in love with. Believe me, I cannot sell a Paolo. People will not turn three hundred twenty-five pages for a Paolo. C'mon, the guy's a secondary character, a, y'know, complication you eventually kill off.
...and that was all before 10 o'clock. The caterer rang and said it was going to be Chicken Kiev instead of Chicken Tarragon. And then the florist phoned to say there aren't any tulips. Oh, and the chilliest has carpel-tunel syndrome. We're not gonna be...
My best shoes, so good to me. I wear them everyday. Down at the heel, holes in the toes. Don't care what people say. My feet's best friends, pals to the end. With them I'm one hot chicky. Though late one night, not much light, I....
Well, I've never told you this but, there were one or two times, back in college, when I'd get really drunk, go to a straight bar and wake up with a woman next to me. But I, I, I told myself it was the liquor and e-everyone experiments in college.
No-no it's okay. It's just that ah, I thought we had something pretty special here. And y'know I-I felt like you were someone I could finally open up to, and... That there's so much in me I have to share with you yet.
Yeah, he loved stilts. One time I was upstairs, I was stealing cigarettes out of my mom's purse, and uh, all of a sudden I look over and there's my dad's head bobbing past the window. He just had this big smile on his face and he was waving 'cause he was always happiest when he was on his stilts.
Now, y'see, most people, when their pets pass on, they want 'em sorta laid out like they're sleeping. But occasionally you get your person who wants them in a pose. Like, chasing their tail, or, uh, jumping to catch a frisbee.
I want you to met some friends of mine. This guy is my hero, he comes in with some stuff he wants it blown up 400%, we said we don't do that, and he says you gotta. And y'know what, we did it. And now anytime anybody wants 400, we just say 'let's Ross it!'
Oh, he's unbelievable. I mean for the first time in three years somebody wants to actually want to talk to me, but do you think he would let me enjoy that, no!! You silly diplomat, why don't you learn some English, Sergei?
Ross, look, I know I've been giving you a lot of jabs and it's partly because I'm very protective of Lizzie, and partly because well, they just keep coming to me. But I have to admit that after all the wonderful things that Lizzie has told me and the many, many, many stories that Rachel has told me that, well you're not all bad.
Oh please, I memorized those numbers when I was 15. But look at all the cool make-it-on-my-own stuff I got! This is my "Please, hire me" sweater. And these are my, "Don't you want to rent me this apartment?" pants.
Rachel and I had a really big fight, can I come in? I-I mean I know we're not supposed to see each other anymore and I'm okay with that, it's just that I don't know anybody in the city and I really need somebody to talk to about it.
I-I was wondering, my niece you see is in from London-well Shropshire really but y'know-well she's about your age I say. Anyway I have tickets for the opera, Die Fledermaus, and I was wondering if you'd like to keep her company this evening?
Hi, this is Heldi from the Morgan Chase museum. I'm calling for Monica Geller. I want to let her know that there was a cancellation and if she's still interested in having the Bing-Geller wedding at our facility, it is available...
Oh you don't have to be sorry. I'm...I'm obviously kidding. I'm not in love with you. I'm not in love with her. I don't hear coconuts banging together. Yeah, I don't...picture your face when I make love to my boyfriend. Anyway, I gotta go. Eh...kiss good-bye? No? Okay.
Before we go on with the show, I just want to say to the bride and groom how lucky they are to have found each other. In every life, a little rain must fall. Fortunately, in my life... It's raining men!
Phoebe's right Frank. I know it's hard to hear, but it would've been wrong to go through with it. I-I-I was being selfish, even though we, we want the same things now, in the future we may not. Is that it, is that what it is?
Ohhhh. Relax, take it easy buddy. Tell me twice, you want me to go? Alright, alright, guess I'll be back for my stuff. But if you think for one second I'm leaving you alone with my fish, you're insane Jack!
It was your mother's idea. Ya know, she didn't want you to know your real father because it hurt her so much when he left, and, I didn't want to go along with it, but, well then she died and, and it was harder to argue with her. Not impossible, but harder.
Uh, I-I-I was hoping to run into you here. I didn't know whether I should call or not, y'know I-I was only in town for a few days. And y'know, I didn't want to intrude on your life or-or anything like that, but I-I really wanted to see you and-but I didn't know if you wanted to see me.
Chandler! You've been Ross's best friend all these years, stuck by him during the drug problems. And now you've taken on Monica as well. Well, I don't know what to say. You're a wonderful human being.
Make sure you get this, they're gonna want it for the bloopers show. Alright cut! Listen up everyone, when we start again it's gonna be the countdown to new years, so I wanna see everybody's excitement.
Forget it Rachel! We're both so proud of how well you're doing. I'm not gonna let you blow it. In fact, if I catch you with a cigarette, you're fired. So go on, get out of here! Go on, I don't want you breathing this stuff! Go on!
Could you pull open the curtains for me? The astronauts from the space shuttle are gonna be on the news, and since we don't have a TV, the lady across the alley said she'd push hers up to a window, so I could watch it.
Oh please. Every moment is precious. Y'know? Besides, somebody had to ride in that other taxi with the rest of your luggage, and your friends don't really seem to care too much that you're leaving.
...anyway, his name is Allan and we've been going out for three years. He was my first client when I became a party planner. He was planning a party for his girlfriend at the time. Oh well. And he was Theta Beta Pi at Syracuse.
Look Joey, there's nothing I can do. Besides, you're probably gonna be out by four anyway. We've just got one short scene. It's just you and Richard, and God knows he's a pro. You'll be fine. Morning Richard.
You see, that's why I did so bad on this test. I'm having a hard time concentrating. When you're up there and you're teaching and your face gets all serious...you look so good. You wear that tight little turtleneck sweater...
I've kinda of had this ah, this crush on you. But since you were with Ross, I-I didn't do anything about it. But, now that you're not, I'd really like to ask you out sometime. So-so that's-that's what I'm doing, now.
...Luckily none of the bullets hit the engine block. So, we made it to the border, but just barely, and I- ...I've been talking about myself all night long, I'm sorry. What about you? Tell me one of your stories.
Listen. As someone who's seen more than her fair share of bad beef, I'll tell you: that is not such a terrible thing. I mean, they're your friends, they're just looking out after you.
Well umm, I thought I was going to go back to my apartment but then I just felt I couldn't really be alone tonight. I was wondering if I could maybe stay here with you, just I really feel that I need to be with family.
No no, it, it's fine, believe me. I do it too. I always answer with the 'I'm OK' head bob. 'I'm OK.' 'You sure?' 'Yeah, I'm fine.' Hey listen, I've got to set up the music. I got a new CD changer, of course the divorce only left me with 4 CD's to change.
Oh, well Richard raved about the food at his party, of course you were sleeping with him. Then I heard the food at that lesbian wedding was very nice, I assume you weren't sleeping with anybody there. Though, at least that would be something.
I'm just sayin', if I see one more picture of Ed Begley, Jr. in that stupid electric car, I'm gonna shoot myself! I mean, don't get me wrong... I'm not against environmental issues per se.... it's just that guy!
Oh, I don't mean to be a square, but I'd really appreciate it if you wait and drink your wine after the kids are asleep? Oh uh, thanks for this, I hope I can do the same for you sometime.
Why did you have to fill your father's head with all that garbage about making things right? Things were fine the way they were! There's chicken in there, put it away. For God's sake, Joey, really.
And then Susan and I got in this big fight because I said maybe we should call off the wedding, and she said we weren't doing it for them, we were doing it for us, and if I couldn't see that, then maybe we should call off the wedding. I don't know what to do.
Yes. Oh my god, are you kidding? Ross is so crazy about you, and I really wanted you to like me, and, it's probably me being totally paranoid, but I kinda got the feeling that maybe you don't.
Her name's Ann, she's a journalist. Ahh, we met on the plane. She asked me if she could finish off my peanuts, I thought she said something else, we had a big laugh. Yeah, I just, I mean I got, I got tired of waiting.
Yeah, and they-and they say that our-that our only chance to have a baby is that if they take my sperm, her egg and put it together in a dish and then put it into another girl. So we were wondering if you could be the girl that we could put it into.
Oh, no, honey, I mean, don't worry, I like hanging out with those guys. It's fun for me. They're different than my other friends, they don't start sentences with, 'You know who just died shoveling snow?'
Oh, well y'know, I would've called but I lost your phone number and then ah, my Mom locked me out of the house so I couldn't find it. And then, I tried to find a pay phone, and ah, the receiver was cut off. So...
Look, I-I-I am sorry that Rachel dumped you 'cause she fell in love with that Mark guy, and you are the innocent victim in all of this, but don't punish your friends for what Rachel did to you.
Of course I remember our kiss. I think about it all the time. I can still hear the coconuts knockin' together I... I just didn't want to tell you 'cause I didn't think that you'd return my love, and now that you have...
Kidney stones! Now, ordinarily Mr. Tribbiani, we try to break up the stones up with shock waves, but they're to close to the bladder now. Which means we can either wait for you to pass them or else go up the urethra...
Kate Miller's awkward and mannered portrayal is laughable. Badda-badda-badda. Ah-ha! Here it is! The direction by Marshal Talmant is... Thank you, boys and girls, you've ruined my life. Please, stuff your talentless faces with my Mother's crab cakes! Excuse me!!
It's weird. I always used to assume, that I would meet someone and fall in love and be happy and all that was just a given. But lately it's like what if it's not. Do you ever have that feeling?
Look umm, I, I was, I was just caught up in the moment. That's all it was. Joey, I'm-I'm sorry you feel bad, but haven't you ever sleep with a women where it meant more to her than it did to you?
Hello. Oh! It's you. Just ah, just one-one sec. I am going to take this call. When I continue, I hope that there will appear on stage this magical thing that in the theatre we call, committing to the moment!
All right, all right, there's a few too many people in this room, and there's about to be one more, so anybody who's not an ex-husband or a lesbian life partner, out you go!
Daryl Hannah was the most beautiful woman that he'd ever seen in his life and I said yeah, I liked her in Splash, a lot, but not so much in- in Wall Street, I thought she had kind of a
Don't get me started. Anyway, umm, since there are three babies and umm, we both got to put our names in, we would be truly honoured if you named the other boy baby.
...has become the penicillin of the twenty-first century. And so today, this hospital is about to take major steps toward leading that revolution. It is truly ironic, on one hand consider the size...
Let me just see if I got this straight. I tell you to stay away from my daughter or I'll have you fired. What you heard was, "Take my daughter, come up to my country house, and ruin my weekend with Rachel!"
So thanks for the warm welcome. It's good to have you guys on my team, and I come to play. I hope you do too. Now, let's go out there and get 'em! Huh? And remember, there is no 'I' in team.
So, in conclusion, the lines all go up , so I'm happy. Great job team! Tomorrow at 8:30. Phil! Nice job. Stevens! Way to go! Joel-burg, you maniac! I love ya! Bing! Good job, couldn't have done it without ya.
No-no-no, no, it's going to be fine. Because umm, because I teach Home Ec, and uh, I can have 30 kids making baby clothes all year long. Y'know it'll-it'll be like my very own little sweatshop.
Oh, you thought, huh? Yeah, well that didn't really work out too well for you did it you idiot!! What are you?! A moron!! Huh?! It says D-13! Okay?! Look you're surrounded by even numbers!! Did that give you some clue?!
Yeah, I was thinking that maybe we could go down to Time Square and pick up some ninja stars. And, oh, um, my friend Larry, he wants me to take a picture of a hooker.
Just relax. Just relax Paul, you're doing great. She likes you. She... Maybe, she likes you. She likes you. Y'know why? Because you're a neat guy. You are the man. You are the man! I still got it. Nice and sexy. You're just a love machine. I'm just a love machine and I won't work for nobody but you! Hey bab-y! Showtime. I'm just a love machine, yeah ba-by!
Oh, am I! I just danced with a wonderfully large woman. And three other girls made eyes at me over the buffet. Oh, I'm not saying it's something I wanna pursue, but it's nice to know I have options.
I realise I don't have any right to start get all parenty on you and everything now, but umm, uhh... Phoebe, would you please look at me and not the puppy, it's very important.
Come on, you gotta admit that our relationship is ah, is hitting a new level now. 'Cause you used to be like the chef, and I was the customer, and now we're like this-this couple that fights.
Well I know I was an idiot! And I tried to forget you, I really did! Y'know after we had lunch last year I spent six months in Africa trying to get you out of my head!
Folks, when we come back we'll be talking about her new book, 'Euphoria Unbound': the always interesting Nora Tyler Bing. You might wanna put the kids to bed for this one.
Now Chandler dear, just because your father and I are getting a divorce it doesn't mean we don't love you. It just means he would rather sleep with the house-boy than me.
Yeah, it's not like I don't have a sense of humor, huh? Hell, I even enjoy a naughty limerick now and then. But there's a time and a place, huh?! Unless you uh, have a limerick right now? No? Okay, well uh, you've got my fax number.
Ooh, hey! Hey, there little fella. Mr. Fuzzy-Man, how are you doing? Aww. Eww! Oh! Eww! Gross! Idiot!! Stupid little, fuzzy, yellow creature!! Oh look at me, I'm so cute, I'm a little chick who's disgusting! God, you're so stupid, how are you not yet extinct!! Quack-quack, quack-quack!! What are you quacking about?! Dumb Donald Doo-Doo!!
But Ross, I'm such having a great time! Your sister has just been telling me that you used to dress up like little, old ladies and hold make-believe tea parties.
Yeah, he's the handy man. He's gonna be retiring next week and everyone who lives here is kicking in a 100 bucks as a thank you for all the hard work type of thing.
Actually, I'm not buying. I'm selling. Let me ask you one question. Do your friends ever have a conversation and you just nod along even though you're not really sure what they're talking about?
No, no, no now in all seriousness, its not a lot of women would've had the guts to come back here tonight, and even fewer, who would do it with their asses hanging out!
Ms. Green would like to establish some ground rules before she comes out. She would appreciate it if you don't use the words old or downhill or they still look pretty damn good.
No, I'm not done. I-I-I just want you to know that I, the reason I didn't look you up was, well I was afraid that you'd react, just well like, the way, the way you're reacting right now, and can't we just, y'know, start from here?
Ooh, Can I have a napkin, please? Could you please hand me a napkin? Would you--Give me this thing all right!! Enough! And you are no longer my friend! We are finished! Nada!! No more! You are a bastard for doing this!! Get away from me!!
You're making a big mistake here. I mean, San Diego's all well and good, but if you give him to me, I'll start him off against a blind rabbit and give you twenty percent of the gains.
You know, I uh, I couldn't help but overhear what you just said, and I think it's time for you to forget about Rose, move on with your life...how 'bout we go get you a drink?
Oh, please, honey, listen, if I can do it, anybody can. You just start with half a dozen European cities, throw in thirty euphemisms for male genitalia, and bam! You have got yourself a book.
If I had one wish, it would be to build a time machine, go back to when I was 7, when Jimmy Hauser had the chicken pox. I would grab that kid and rub him all over my face.
Now Mr. Kaplan Sr. likes his coffee strong, so your gonna use two bags instead of one, see. Now pay attention, 'cause this part's tricky, see some people use filters just once.
Don't you point your pants at me! We have no choice! Anywhere that's half-decent would've be booked months ago, Ross don't you understand? This is our wedding I'm talking about.
Stop saying you're not talented, you're very talented. It's just with the bird dead and all, there's very little act left. Oh, honey, give me a break, will ya? Oooh, ooh, I'll talk to you later.
Y'know what, I want to talk to you about this so much, but we should probably do it when we could really get into it, are you free for dinner tomorrow night?
Of course I knew! What did you think? Your father is no James Bond. You should've heard some of his cover stories. "I'm sleeping over at my accountant's," I mean, what is that? Please!
Well I guess on some level I always knew I was straight. I though I was supposed to be something else, you know, I'm an ice dancer, all my friends are gay, I was just tryin' to fit in.
Oh, yeah, during the summer, I spend most weekends at my sister's beach house, which you are welcome to use by the way. Although, I should probably tell you, she's a porn star.
Well, uh, when Joey gave it to me, he said, "This is 'cause I know ya like Rabbits, and I know ya like cheese." Thanks. I love it. And I know how hard it must have been for you to find.
You know, nothing makes God happier than when two people, any two people, come together in love. Friends, family, we're gathered here today to join Carol and Susan in holy matrimony.
Listen, we both know you're gonna do it 'cause you're not a jerk. Okay? So you can either sulk here for a half hour and then go pick them up, or save us both time and sulk in the car.
Of course they're gonna say he's dead. They don't want the bad publicity. It's all a great big cover-up. Do you have any idea how high up this thing goes?
OK, look, this isn't the first time somebody's said something to me about this, but, I don't know... I always made excuses about it, like... uhhh... 'I'm just a social drinker,' or, 'C'mon, it's Flag Day.'
I know!! It's a museum! What, you're the only one around here who can make a joke! At least mine was funny. Ah, waiter, we will have two lobsters and a menu.
I wanted a big wheel. And instead my parents got me this little plastic chicken that you hop around on. It was embarrassing; kids made fun of me. That was a pretty tough year.
Oh, listen you guys. I have this friend at Bloomingdale's who's quitting tomorrow and he wants to abuse his discount. So, anyone want to come with me and take advantage of it?
I've been thinking about getting rid of it. I was driving it the other day and saw my reflection in a store window. Your mother's right, I do look like an ass.
It looks like one of her eyebrows fell down. Now unless someone convinces her to let me bleach it, Jean-Claude Van Damme is gonna be making out with Gabe Kaplan.
Oh, believe me, I don't want to get hurt either. I'm being smart about this. See these guys? They're the best trainers in the world, and Hoshi here used to be a paid assassin. A house painter! He used to be a house painter.
Well, I think you're better off without him. Oh honey, I know he's your daddy but, but to me he's still the irresponsible creep who knocked up your mom and stole her Gremlin.
Umm, no. See I already thought she was dead so I kinda made my peace with it. Plus, I'm going to a concert tomorrow. So... I'd invite you, but umm, I only have two tickets left.
It's like I'm lookin' in a mirror. Anyway, they're called "fishtachios". They taste exactly like pistachios, but they're made primarily of reconstituted fish bits. Here, try one. You're not allergic to anything, are you?
Do you remember how your father used to be? Always yelling, always yelling nothing made him happy, nothing made him happy, not that wood shop, not those stupid little ships in the bottle, nothing. Now he's happy! I mean, it's nice, he has a hobby.
It looks like we have surpassed last year's pledge total! Thank you viewers! The pledge that did it was taken by one of our volunteers... Oh boy! And may I say one of our sharpest dressed volunteers, Mr. Joseph Tribbiani!
This is the housekeeper speaking. And by the way, young lady, that is not how one addresses a person on the telephone. First one identifies oneself and then asks for the person with whom one wishes to speak.
I know, I know, I'm such an idiot. I guess I should have caught on when she started going to the dentist four and five times a week. I mean, how clean can teeth get?
Well, if that were true, I'd dating my Aunt Ruth. And the two times we went out were just plain awkward. Come on, you think she should go out with me, don't you?
Hey! Okay! Well thanks for coming out to see me. I just-I just thought it would be a very good idea to talk about this baby stuff in person. Y'know...
Well I did. I really did. And you guys, I've got to say, I'm sorry if I was a little weird after the last time we went out. I guess I was just nervous or something.
Ok, all right, well aren't there times when you come home at the end of the day, and you're just like, 'if I see one more cup of coffee'...
Okay, listen, I really like you. Okay? I think this can go somewhere. So what if I'm close to my family, are you gonna let that stand in the way of us?
So we talked about the whole presentation yesterday at lunch and he wondered if one person would be enough to get a take on the trip and I said, "Yeah, absolutely!"
In The Category Of Favorite Returning Male Character The Nominees Are John Wheeler from General Hospital , Gavin Grant from The Young and the Restless , Dunkin Harrington from Passions , and Joey Tribbiani from Days of Our Lives . And the Soapie goes to......Gavin Grant from The Young and the Restless!
It's probably because not mature enough. Or smart enough. Maybe he doesn't like the way I dress-No that can't be it. It's really gotta be the smart thing. Oh I'm so stupid! I'm just like this incredibly pretty stupid girl!
Oh...my Gawd, I-I understand. I-I am so sorry, I'll go. Good-bye Monica , I wish you a lifetime of happiness with him. Chandler, you call me when this goes in the pooper.
Oh honey! This is so exciting! I thought we screwed you up so bad this day would never come. Oh and just think. Soon there'll be lots of little Bings.
Well Lilly, when you see Lilly would you give her that, that note? Because I wanted to talk to her at the memorial but, well I pictured her getting mad at me the way you got mad at me and I well, I chickened out. So, uh, I wrote her that note, would you give it to her please?
Yeah, I've been thinking ever since you said we were having triplets, the best thing for me to do is to drop out of college and get a job.
Well, think about it. It's always on the news. 'A man is being held up, at gunpoint.' 'Tourists are being terrorised, at gunpoint.' And I just kept thinking: why does people continue to go there? Oh, ah. I should go.
And in fifth grade I got into a fight. Well, it wasn't really a fight. Richard Darinvel bit me on the nose and, and I feel down. I still have a little scare right here you can see it.
Uh, I gotta apologize for Kara's coffee. Y'know, I feel sorry for it if it ever got in a fight, it's not strong enough to defend itself. Did you hear what I said Bing?
No, it's only been six years. I just wanted to put a nice memory in your head so you'd know that I wasn't always such a terrible guy. ...Joe. Y'ever been in love?
We got the proofs back from that photo shoot, you know, the one with the little vegetables. Anyway, they pretty much sucked, so, I blew off the rest of the day, and I went shopping... ... and I got you, I'm looking, I'm looking, I'm looking, I got you...
And the vet said it was time. And so from half a world away, while my Mother held the phone to his ear, I said good bye to my dog,. In seven languages.
Phoebe, I have spent the last eight months in a steel tube with men, thinking about this moment. I am not gonna let a bunch of itchy spots stand between us.
Umm, no. Thanks, but I'll give these to Betty. So I read your evaluation of Tag, or to use his full name, Tag Sweetcheeks Jones. Is something going on with you two?
No, I'd be hearing about 'Why didn't I get the honey-glazed ham?', I didn't spend enough on flowers, and if I spent more she'd be saying 'Why are you wasting your money? I don't need flowers, I'm dead'.
Hey, Bob, it's Jade. Listen, I just wanted to tell you that I was really hurt when you didn't show up the other day, and just so you know, I ended up meeting a guy.
So I got it in the junior miss department, big diff. Anyway check it out man, it's gonna make a hell of a conversation piece at out next cocktail party, huh pal?
Okay. All right uh, Alex now when Joey says his line, "Take good care of your Momma son," that's your cue to cry. Got it? All right, let's do this.
Yeah. My Dad says if I spend as much time helping him clean apartments, as I do daydreaming about outer space, he'd be able to afford a trip to the Taj Mahal.
Actually, that can't happen. Yeah because you all have such different looks, we're putting you with Raymond and Kyle with Ben. So it'll be either you two or you two.
Why can't we just have what we have now? Why can't we just talk, and laugh, and make love, without feeling obligated to one another... and up until tonight I thought that's what you wanted too.
You're absolutely right they are writing me out of the show. They don't know exactly when it's going to happen, but apparently going to be very soon and that's it.
Oh...wait...you two think of me as family?! Oh, I have to ask you something now and be honest; do you want me to sing Careless Whisper or Lady In Red?
Ooh, then I guess the panty raid last night was totally uncalled for. Ok, I am going to take a shower and today I will be singing Jim Crochee's Leroy Brown.
'Despair fills the mattress showroom. My kingdom is suddenly without a queen. I'm so depressed I'm going to slash... my prices!! Check it out! Four ninety-nine for a pillow top queen set! I'm going medieval on prices!
You think you could make a mess and the big man in coveralls will come in here and clean it up, huh? Well, why don't think of someone else for a change?
Oh, no, nonononono, you see what he's doing? He knows no-one's gonna say all those names, so they'll wind up calling her Geller, then he gets his way!
Just for a coupla days. I got a job midtown. I figure I'm better off staying with the kid than hauling my ass back and forth on the ferry. I don't know this one.
I don't know, I-I guess I just had you pegged as one of those guys who're always 'me, me, me.' But you... you're a giver. You're like the most generous man I ever met. I mean... you're practically a woman.
Mom, we've been through this. No, I'm not calling him. I don't care if it is his kid, the guy's a jerk. No, I'm not alone. Joey's here. What do you mean, Joey who? Joey who?
Sweetheart, we love you just as much as Ross! Now, I'm sorry about everything that happened and I'd probably never be able to make it up to you, but here's a start.
Alrighty. Were gonna start with some basic third stage breathing exercises, so Mummies, why dont you get on your back? And... coaches, you should be supporting Mummys head.
Well you're fingerprints were all over my badge so I just ran it through the computer and this was listed as your last known address so I just checked it out.
Monica, I started my day by peeing in front of twenty-five other women, and you're worried about who's gonna take you to the Big Apple Circus?
I can't until I'm the ultimate fighter. I will do it. I'm telling you, the day will come when children will argue over who will win a fight, me or Superman. Now, I'm not saying I could beat Superman, but y'know, kids are stupid.
Yeah, but it wasn't much fun dropping it off at the dry cleaners in the skirt. So I need everything down to underwear, so if you're willing, I'm all yours.
I just wanted to come by and thank you for not laughing in my face yesterday. And I noticed there aren't any plants in your office so I wanted to bring you your first... There is a plant in your office.
All-right fine, but I just want to say, I'm not paying for your wine cellar. You thieving, would be speaking German if it weren't for us, cheap little man.
Bing! Read your Computech proposal, a real homerun. Ooh. Barely got ya that time, get over here. Come on. Wham! Good one. That was a good one. Keep at it team.
I met Phoebe today. She was really nice to me eventhough I'm such a loser. And, then when I was walking home I thought about her a lot, it was weird, but kinda cool.
Apparently Howie's editing now. Yeah, he-he-he calls me up and asks me if he can edit my new movie. Can you believe that?! Y'know I-I-I haven't spoken to him in like ten years and he asks me for a favor!
Ahh, I just have one problem left that I do not know how to solve. Uhh, Rachel maybe you want to come upstairs and help me figure it out?
Wait, y'know what, I-I came to you because I thought you'd understand! Oh no!! Y'know, I would storm out of here right now if-if I had some money, or a place to go...
Okay, who are you? The Hardy boys? Look, I don't need to steal some stupid ring, all right? I make $1,600 a week doing what I do; any of you guys make that?
Okay, okay look, I know I'm being Mr. Inappropriate today, but it's just so tough, I mean see you walking around and I just wanna touch you and hold you, come on no one's around, just, just kiss me.
I probably should've just left years ago when the offers were pouring in, but y'know I just got so comfy here! And... Ohh, I turned down some amazing work!
Yeah, well, anyhoo, here is your check. Thank you for all the trouble you went through. Um, listen, you didn't eat a lot of it while you were cooking, did you?
It's not the pants. It's you that is backwards. And if, and if you don't understand how important this is to me, well then, perhaps we shouldn't get married at all!
This is nice. I pay two hundred dollars for dinner, you put down twenty, and you come out looking like Mr. Big Shot. You really want to be Mr. Big Shot? Here, I'll tell you what, you pay the whole bill, Mr. Big Shot, all right.
Oh God! Here we go again. Why does this keep happening to me? Is it something I'm putting out there? Is this my fault? Or am I just nuts?
Hi, but I'm not here, you haven't met me. I'll make a much better first impression tomorrow when I don't have 20 hours of cab and plane on me.
Jeez, thank you really that is so nice. But um, to be honest, I don't think I can wear these, they're so tight, I feel like I'm on display. I'm sorry.
Oh Rachel, I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to overwhelm you. It's just that, when those gates open, you... Hard to close 'em. But they are closed now. Believe me.
And if it were true, how dare you come to me ask me for tips about a character that I've been playing for 20 years-I'll give you a tip!
Um, oh, I don't know. I mean, it's definitely weird not being with Ross, but I guess I'm doing OK. Actually I've got some of his stuff that he, um....
These are my night vision goggles. This is the book I pretend to read when I'm watching her in the park. And these are Mad Lips, they're just for fun.
Flowers, liquor, recarpet first floor. New guest bath, landscaping. I'm paying to remodel this guys house. I'm going to give that son on a bitch, a piece of my mind.
Hey by the way, I'm sure Sipowicz is gonna be all right. I heard that kid from Silver Spoons is really good. And where did you find my badge?
Listen, I-I-I don't come to this city much so I don't know if you're crazy or this is some kind of street theater, but could I have my keys.
That he wouldn't pay for my lawyer! Then he told me to come here and learn about the value of money from the one daughter he's actually proud off.
Okay, my trainer, Ho Chi, is teaching me a combination of Gee Koon Doe and Brazilian street fighting, I've even had my own octagon training ring designed.
Uh, no, not really, just that I was too young, y'know, but I don't see how I could all of the sudden be too young, 'cause I'm older than I was when we first got together.
Okay! We're about an hour away from getting the scene lit. So uh, if you guys don't mind, can we run it a couple of times?
Yo! Can I have your attention, please, Best Man, making a toast here. Thank you. I remember when Barry got home from his first date with Rachel...
I want to let her know that there was a cancellation and if she's still interested in having the Bing-Geller wedding at our facility, it is available...
Oh, you know, the usual, teaching aerobics, partying way too much. Oh, and in case you were wondering, those are my legs on the new James Bond poster.
Oh hey, Ross. Umm, see, I was thinking maybe you two could switch apartments because Phoebe's more our kind of people. Something to think about.
-hard quality. And uh, while Daryl Hannah is beautiful in a conventional way, you are luminous with a kind of a delicate grace. Then, uh, that-that-that's when you started yelling.
She's checking the coats. Joey, I'm gonna go wash the cab smell off my hands. Will you get me a white Zinfandel, and a glass of red for Janice.
She's checking the coats. Joey, I'm gonna go wash the cab smell off my hands. Will you get me a white Zinfandel, and a glass of red for Janice.
Okay. Well, it was great meeting you. And uh Rachel, I-I don't think I'll be calling you because umm, y'know you've gotten weird. Take care you guys.
Wow! Uhh, Rachel uhh, you're a real special lady, but my divorce isn't final yet and, and, and we've been on four days, so I'm thinking "No, but thanks."
Oh yeah, I still hang with Simmons and Zana, y'know. I see Spindler a lot. Devane, Kelly, and I run into Goldie from time to time. Steve Brown, Zuchoff, McGwire, J.T., Breadsly.
I know its frightening, but, big picture. The birth part is just one day, and when its over, were all gonna be parents for the rest of our lives.
Well, it's time for a new family to start their memories here and hopefully their check will clear before they find the crack in the foundation and the asbestos in the ceiling.
Okay. You've got a small, minor infection in that left eye. I want you to take these drops three times a day and you'll be as good as new.
No-no, it was! She was in Sex Toy Story 2, Lawrence of Alabia, and I got her autograph! The guys at the comic book store aren't gonna believe this!
Friends. Family. We are gathered to celebrate here today the joyous union of Ross and Emily. May the happiness we share with them today be with them always. Now Emily, repeat after me. I, Emily...
I'm sorry Chandler, y'know you are such a sweet guy and I, I don't want to hurt you. Oh, I wish there was something I can do to make you feel better.
Well, I got tanked myself last night. Pretty dicey drive home, Tapanzi Bridge never looked smaller. That's okay, you're still my number one guy! Bing!
Keep in mind, he's never used this product before, you're gonna see how easy this is to do. Go ahead. This works with any milk carton.
Uh, Delaware. She's on her way though, so until she gets here, I'm gonna be your coach. But don't worry, she told me all about the la-Mazada stuff.
From New York City, New York! Appearing in his Ultimate Fighting Championship debut! He's known for his confrontational business style. Ladies and Gentlemen, introducing Pete Beck-errrr!!
Joey, I'm gonna tell you the same thing I told Al Minser and his pyramid of dogs. Take any job you can get and don't make on the floor.
Monica! Chandler! I'm really-really sorry about tonight. I don't know if Joey told you; I just couldn't get out of going to this play. I'm sorry. Have a great time.
You say you love this man, yet you're about to ruin the happiest day of his life. I'm afraid I have to agree with you friend Pheebs.. This is a..this is a...terrible, terrible plan.
Hey man, check it out, I got some great stuff to dehydrate here. I got some grapes, got some apricots, I thought it would be really cool to see what happens with these water balloons.
Folks, has this ever happened to you. You go to the refrigerator to get a nice glass of milk, and these darn cartons are so flingin'-flangin' hard to open.
Listen Chandler, the way I see it is that I was lucky enough to find someone that I really love. I just-I wanna be around her as much as I can.
No no. Henry's almost two and he's talking and everyting. Here. You know, the other day he told me he liked me better than his other grandpa. Now in all fairness his other grandpa's a drunk but still. . .
Oh, what do you know? No one's going up to you and saying, "Hi, is that your nostril? Mind if we push this pot roast through it?"
You're taking this all wrong. Because, if I didn't leave you that tip, you wouldn't of come down here, we wouldn't be having this argument, and there wouldn't be this ah, heat between us.
But umm, you're right. I think that a person should know where they come from. Wh-which is why I ah, ahh, okay. I'm your mother.
Well, I don't know what to tell you dear. The only thing I can think of is that she always used to say that before she died, she wanted to see everything.
Sweethart, but none of that matters if it's too soon for you. It's fine! We don't have to move in together. I just-I want you to be happy
Alright, Monica dear, I'm gonna hit the road. Now I've left my 10 verbs on the table. And you be sure and send me that finished poem.
I needed to buy a hammer the other night, and I'm out walkin' around the neighborhood but apparently there are no hardware stores open past midnight in the Village.
So, the essence of the character is rooted in her confidence. So, when Jessica enters a room for instance, she owns everything and every person in that room. You try.
The next one's dedicated to Rachel from Ross. Rachel, he wants you to know he's deeply sorry for what he did and he hopes you can find it in your heart to forgive him.
Yeah, but, I don't do that anymore. I got kinda sick of it, and then I couldn't come up with anything good, so they fired me.
I mean, how hard can it be? Y'know, I mean, y'know, babies, y'know who doesn't want babies right? And besides y'know, I never had a Dad around, and ah, now-now I always will, 'cause y'know, it'll be me. Right?
Well, if he's up against a jungle cat or an animal with horns, you've got to give the little guy something. Otherwise it's just cruel.
Sorry, I wa- I was just saying to my friend that I thought you were the most beautiful woman that I'd ever seen in my- in my life. And then he said that- you said you thought
Okay, my next song's called Phoebe Buffay, What Can I Say. I Really Loved When We Were Singing Partners, And I Shouldn't Have Left You That Way.
So, what do you say, Joey? You get the whole set of encyclopedias for twelve hundred dollars, which works out to just 50 bucks a book!
I don't know which one, but I do know I need a cigarette. So what do you say we take a break, we go outside, and we'll figure this out when we come back?
...we talked through most of the night and we realized that the reason we were so angry at each other was because there are still feelings there. So...
No, but you should go to Chandler's. Because none of us knows how to cook, we'll probably just end up drinking all day.
Here we go people! Boxing Day! The Lucille Lortel Theatre, blah-la-la-la... Ah-ha! Joey Tribianni, gives an uneven performance, but Mr. Tribianni is not the worst thing in this production.
The three losers. Oh, poor Lily. Ohh, y'know I-I heard about what happened, that must have been just terrible for you, losing your mother that way.
Ohh, I don't think so. I mean it would be different if it was way into the future &#150;and-and-and we were getting married or something.
All right, kids. Here's the deal. According to my client's will, he wants to leave all his earthly possessions to "the noisy girls in the apartment above mine".
We've been trying to get pregnant, uh pretty much ever since we got engaged, we thought we'd get a jump on things, y'know no one's getting any younger.
Yes. Yes it is. I burned the formula and I put your diapers on backwards. I mean, I made up a song to sing you to sleep, but that made you cry even more!
Okay, I'm going to need a comforter, but did you have a hypoallergenic one because otherwise I get very nasal. Do you have a cat? 'Cause it's already happening. Do you hear that?
Well, if that's what you kids are calling it these days then, yes I am. I uh, I've kinda been waiting for the right person.
Oh. And Rachel has been really incredible in getting my morning bagel for me. It's amazing how she gets it right almost every time!
Ohh, well when you said all you were going to be doing between now and the time you leave is packing, you didn't really leave me much choice. Did you?
Okay. Understanding a little more why you're single. Ohh! Y'know, I have a friend you would like, she's really pretty. And then we could double date!
Ahh! Fair, schmair! Y'know? Look, if you want to get back at Ross, I am here for you. Really? No-no, I say-I say, I say we get back at him right on this couch. Right here!
Rachel, it's not that your friend is bad, it's that she's so bad, she makes me want to put my finger through my eye into my brain and swirl it around.
Uh, that's definitely a, uh, valid question. And, uh, the answer would be yes. Yes I was. But, see, I wanted it to be this phenomenal kiss that happened at this phenomenal moment, because, well, 'cause it's you.
No. But, Monica and I were talking, and-and I was so upset about the hall being knocked down, and she suggested that we put the wedding off for a bit.
Ross, I have been a divorce attorney for 23 years and never had I so much business from one client. Why don't you tell me what happened.
One meal! That's all I'm asking for. Please? We go out, we eat, and if you don't have a good time, I give you ten grand, we call it even.
Well, yes, it's kind've an unusual house. It has umm, three beautiful bedrooms and ah, no baths. But y'know, the ocean is right there.
All right, I was 15, it was my best friend, Ruth, and we got drunk on that hard cider, and then suddenly, I don't know, we were, we were making out.
Oh well thank you. Such a gentleman. Thank you. Ahh, it all looks so nice, so festive, all the balloons... The funniest thing happened to me on the way here. I was...
They're always going to tell you they don't need toner, but that's okay because whatever they say, you can find the answer to it here in this script.
Oh great! Well, tell him thanks. And since uh, Joey seems like such a nice guy, maybe we could go on a date sometime?
Well, you, wait no, my Mother didn't want us to be together, but the worst thing she ever did was tie me to the porch.
Oy. Look, I've been through a divorce, trust me you're gonna be fine. You just can't see it now because you haven't had any closure.
You are iron. You are steel! Let me ask you something, how come when I call your computer support line, I have to wait an hour and a half?
Well, I don't care about the divorces either, but I wouldn't date him. It's just that he's obviously still in love with this Rachel girl.
Okay look, Ross, just so you know that since Lizzie likes you so much, I've decided to accept the fact that you're going out with her.
I really don't think he does. And y'know what? Maybe you guys could help clue him in. Y'know, tell him I'm-I'm not interested in a serious relationship or something.
Well, it's your mother's bridge night so I thought that I would come into the city for a little Monicuddle. Since when did you start smoking cigars?
I don't know if Monica told you but this is the first date I've gone on since my divorce so, if I seem a little nervous, I am.
Well, maybe that's because you spent four years ignoring me. I mean, would it have been so hard to say 'Morning, Luisa'? Or 'Nice overalls'?
It's just that I uh, have been working for ten years now at this meaningless, dead-end job and nobody here even knows I exist!
You seek me out. Something deep in your soul calls out to me like a foghorn. Janice, Janice. You want me. You need me. You can't live without me. And you know it. You just don't know you know it. See ya.
What?! I can't believe you're trying to stifle me! When just 14 hours ago we figured out that that is exactly what my mother was trying to do to me!
I still can't believe they're tearing it down. It really is the most lovely building you'll ever see. I mean it's over... Oh my God!
The next time you want to dump a fire alarm in a trash chute, don't wrap it in a blanket that says, "Property of Phoebe Buffay not Monica."
We can, we can go to Aruba! When I went there on what would have been our honeymoon, it was, uh... it was really nice. You would've liked it.
Well, I don't know. I mean, it's conceivable that you wanted to sabotage your marriage so that the sibling would feel less of a failure in the eyes of the parents.
Every actor at one time or another-opp! Every actor thinks he stinks, even Lawrence Oliver at sometimes thought he stank, Bob Redford won't even watch himself.
Hey, sorry I'm late. But my, uh, grandfather, he- died about two hours ago. But I-I-I couldn't get a flight out 'til tomorrow, so here I am!
Oh, this is, this is unbelievable. I mean, first you sleep with my ex-girlfriend then you insult my inteligenct by lying about it and then you kill my fish, my Buddy?
Listen guys, it was great seeing you again. Mon, um, easy on those cookies, okay? Remember, they're just food, they're not love.
You know that thing you put over here with the pin in it? It's time to take the pin out. You'll find someone, I know you will. The right woman is just waiting for you.
Okay that's fine, I'll walk away. And I'll never bother you again, but only if you tell me Chandler's willing to give you everything I am.
I think his butt would like to get this shot before lunch. Once again, rolling... water working... and action....and cut. What was that?
Oh, right, all right, you know what pallie I understand, consider me gone, you know what, I'll be out by the time you get home from work tomorrow.
I just, I want you to know I didn't used to be like this. Before I meet your sister I was like this normal guy who sold beepers and cellular phones.
Ahh, forget it! I'll never be any good at this, my mom was right, I'm just a big potato with arms, and legs, and a head.
Well, it's technically not a zoo per se, it's more of an interactive wildlife experience. Let me ask you some questions about, is it, uh, Marcel?
He's out banging other women over the head with a club, while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet!
We may not have any weapons, but we still have food. In the basement I saw potatoes and some dry pasta, and a few tins of tuna!
No-no, I heard what you said, funny. I like funny. This team is about hard work, but it's also about having fun. Good to have you aboard Bing!
Excuse me. You should check this out, tell the other tenants. Apparently he's running around looking for some kind of a hot girl.
Naah, I crapped out, but Mr. 21 over here he cleans up, 300 bucks, check it out he buys me these new shoes, sweet huh?
Well yeah, I'm sorry. I know this is the wrong time and the wrong place but I had to tell ya! I wanna spend my life with you. I wanna marry you. I wanna have kids with you.
No, no, that's just Chuck Magioni, I-I sold him a house last year! And I'm very sorry, but I don't know where your Father is, and that's the truth.
I'll never remember all of that. So uh, what's the deal? Rachel comes home, people pop out and yell stuff, is that it?
Ah Joey. Joey Tribbiani. Listen Joey, I got a problem, I just got a call from my dance captain, he's having a relationship crisis and can't get out of Long Island.
Uh yeah, I can't believe I ever went out with somebody who would actually have an open flame in the middle of a wooden area.
Uh no, I have to go in a few hours. I have to be on the red-eye. Well listen, y'know, next time you're in Minsk umm...
Oh no-no, never say that. If we can't get it out then we can cut around the stain, add a little lace, you make a stylish throw.
I don't know. A week? Maybe two? The money will turn up! People will always wanna invest in movies! Hey, you're not rich are ya?
Well, because you'd be giving up a baby, and I-I really don't-I don't know if there's anything I can say that could make you understand the pain of giving up a baby. So, umm,
We've got a couple changes in your schedule. Your 4:00 herbal massage has been pushed back to 4:30 and Miss Somerfield canceled her 5:30 shiatsu.
Oookay. Are you aware that possession of an illegal exotic is, uh, punishable by up to two years in prison and confiscation of the animal?
Say Rachel, I was wondering if you'd like to go to a movie with me sometime. As my lover! Nnnsch, to out there. Maybe you'd just like to ah, get something to eat with me sometime? As my lover.
Well, I kinda wanted to sell the cookies. The girl who sells the most wins a trip to Spacecamp, and gets to sit in a real space shuttle.
All right, I'm leaving! Because I'm not going to spend one more day with someone whose out to sabotage my every move. That's you Rachel!
Well, based on what I heard, you two certainly don't qualify for an annulment. If you two don't want to be together you'll have to file for divorce.
Oh, yeah! I-I ran into you in the hallway in your building. It was right after I slept with Joey. He dumped me the next day.
No! I mean you're a really nice guy and I'm happy to be your roommate and your friend, I'm just y'know, I just don't feel that way about you.
F.Y.I.. I've decided to pay a professional musician to play in here on Sunday afternoons. Her name is Stephanie... something. She's supposed to be very good.
Well, you have to understand how humiliating it was for me up on that altar in front of my entire family, all my friends.
Well ah, the short version is, I ah pursued her for a couple of months, then I gave her a check for 20,000 dollars, and she was mine.
I'm sorry I find it hard to believe that a group of people who spends as much time together as you guys do has never bumped uglies.
...and I know I'll never miss doing it, but I gotta tell you, it's pretty cool knowing that you're making a difference in a kid's life.
I uh, I've been to his apartment and he wasn't there, and uh. I need to talk to him, so do you have any idea where he is?
And anyhow, I'm sorry I was so harsh before, but you have to understand that I still look at Lizzie like she's a twelve-year-old girl.
Yes, this Russell, Ross's divorce lawyer, just tell him that since I haven't heard from him, I assume he's decided to give the marriage a try.
He lives at 74 Laurel Drive in Middletown. If you hit the Dairy Queen, you've gone too far. You can take my cab.
Don't do this to me, again. You'd know I'd stay here in a minute, but I'd really miss so much work, they'll fire me.
Anyway, I schedule performers for the childrens libraries around the city and I was just thinking, have you ever thought about playing your songs for kids?
Well, we've been flirting back and forth, but I was hoping that tonight it would turn into something a little more than that.
For I'm loved by a pretty wonderful boy! Hello! And welcome to the show. I see some of our regulars in the audience. And a couple of irregulars.
Oh no, that's-that's an old card. Umm, I wanted to get out of that and-and do something where I can really help people and-and make a difference.
You know, in some cultures having a third nipple is actually a sign of virility. You get the best huts and women dance naked around you.
I-I used to be just like you. And then one day I saw a movie that changed my life. Did you ever see Dead Poets' Society?
May I have the rings? Emily, place this ring on Ross's finger as a symbol of your bond everlasting. Ross, place this ring in Emily's hand as a symbol of the love that encircles you forever.
May I have the rings? Emily, place this ring on Ross's finger as a symbol of your bond everlasting. Ross, place this ring in Emily's hand as a symbol of the love that encircles you forever.
How are you? Look, you guys wanna meet the group? Come on. So, are you one of the ones who fooled around with my dad?
You've spoiled everything! It's like a nightmare! My friends and family are out there! How can I face them?! How can you do this to me?!
You've spoiled everything! It's like a nightmare! My friends and family are out there! How can I face them?! How can you do this to me?!
I don't know, could be an hour, could be three, but relax, she's doing great. So, uh, tell me, are you currently involved with anyone?
Y'know what daddy? If you don't like Ross, that's fine. It doesn't matter to me, I'm gonna go out with him anyway.
Look, I know he's not perfect, but the truth is, at the end of the day, I still really wanna be Mrs. Dr. Barry Farber, D.D.S.
So, I understand you're thinking of having a baby? Well, I see you're nine months pregnant. That's a good start. How you doing with your contractions?
Really stupid. And I don't even know how it happened. I'm sorry, honey, I promise it will never happen again. Are we okay now?
Well, anyhoo, um, we are looking for a couple of chefs who can create some Thanksgiving-themed recipes. You think you might be interested?
Thank you soo much for coming on such a short notice. Ladies and gentlemen, I've-I've-I've been practicing medicine for twenty-three years, and I'm stumped.
Oh God, we just clicked! Y'know how people just click? Like he came by to pick me up, and I opened the door, and it was just like, click! Did he tell you?
Absolutely. Okay, first we'll start with a little club soda and salt, and then if that doesn't work we can go back to...
If you're planning on doing that throughout the entire flight. Please tell me now. So that I could that a sedative...or perhaps slip you one.
She said, "If I'm not gonna be happy getting married somewhere that we find in a day, well then we should just postpone it."
Oh! Oh! The usher must be right! What, with all that training they go through! Get out!! Here! Hey man, you want the aisle?
We might still have some money, if your father didn't think it was a good idea to sell ice over the Internet.
Well then here's the deal, you won't have to so long as never ever show your faces in this coffee house ever again.
No! That's bluffing. Lesson number one. Let me tell you something... everything you hear at a poker game is pure crap. : Nice earrings.
I just came by to give you a kiss, I have to go pick up the baby, so. I'll see you later sweetheart, you too Chandler.
Ross, it's going to be okay. I'm not going down there to hook up with a bunch of guys. I really like you. I like how things are going between us.
You know, I like the way you have efficiently folded this tab under. See in a tape emergency you could shave valuable seconds off your time.
Umm, it costs $16,000 each time you do this. So, umm, we're kinda using all the money we have to do it just this one time.
Yes! Although, I think we may be seeing a little too much of some people. Aren't you a little old to be wearing a dress like that?
Yeah. Ever since you flashed my badge at me, I kinda can't stop thinking about you. You're the prettiest, fake undercover whore I've ever seen.
Of course, you did. Forgot something else too ya bastard! Well, what about you? You're not feeling left out or anything are ya?
Hi Rachel. Ohh, I've been meaning to ask you. Have you seen the new Ralph Lauren sheets? Ohh, what am I thinking. Of course you have.
It's all right. It's all right. You don't have to explain. This isn't the first boyfriend bonfire that we've seen get out of control.
Nooo. And there's really no reason he should find out, so ah let's not make a big deal about it, okay?
Oh, they're working on this week, it's a total mess. But uh, I'm staying at my parents' house, we could go there.
I know! I know! And then you lose your apartment! And then you lose your job! And then your ex-wife gets married so fast! And now the coffee-ahh!! Ross, we need to talk.
What that woman... did. I am not doin that. Its just gonna have to stay in, thats all, everything will be the same, itll just stay in.
Oh no, no, right I shouldn't have said married. Uh, please don't go freaky on me. I didn't mean it. Well, I didn't say it; I take it back!
Hey. Oh no it's fine, don't worry about it. Yeah-no, stop apologizing, it's okay. Yeah! I'll talk to you tomorrow. I should uh, probably go.
Us, what about you guys? Man you really, bing, gave it to old Mr. Clean back there. He was a big guy.
Tell her, David. 'I don't wanna go to Minsk and work with Lifson and Yamaguchi and Flench, on nonononononono. I wanna stay here and make out with my girlfriend!!'
Hey uh, I don't mean to be presumptuous but I have these two tickets to the ballroom dancing finals tomorrow night if you want to go?
Okay, you're at ten centimeters. Time to start having some babies. All right, I want only the father in here please.
I know. I know, and when he proposed to me, everyone said "Don't do it, he's just gonna do to you what he did to Rachel," and now I feel so stupid.
Oh, yeah. I love Jennifer Van Murray's work. She's so brilliantly incisive when it comes to deconstructing the psyche of the American middle class.
Well, any how, some how I got pregnant, and, and I was scared. I was stupid and sellfish, and I was 18 years old. I mean, you remember what it's like to be eighteen years old?
Well, ever since we announced the engagement, he's been acting really weird, and then last night, he came home smelling like Chanel.
And that big bloke with the beard, he has got a trick hip. Yeah. And uh, and David over there, I heard he doesn't wear a cup.
Yes, and come see the bird show at 4. The macaws wear hats. Well it's a lot cuter if your monkey hasn't just died.
We are aware of the problem you are referring too. But as far as increasing security, I'm afraid the library is very understaffed. I, I can't help you.
No, that's not it. So, you're a soap actor? Well this must be pretty exciting for you to be in a real play, hmm?
Uh-oh-okay. Uh-oh-okay. I know what you all are thinking. But Chandler is in Yemen! I'm a young woman! I have needs! I can't wait forever!
And finally, our biggest item of the night, the 22-foot gentleman's day sailer sailboat. The winning bid was a whooping $20,000!
Oh, will you mind if I wash up? Because I came straight from work and who knows where these babies have been.
Well, don't think I haven't noticed your potential. Well, I've got a project for you that's a lot more related to fashion. How does that sound?
Yeah hey, you know if you want I can take you around back and show you where he hit his head on the rain gutter.
Car's waiting downstairs, I just wanted to drop off these copies of my book for your friends. Anything you want from Lisbon?
You know, my brother and his boyfriend have been trying to adopt for three years. What agency did you two go through?
Sweetie! So this is where you work? Oh, it's wonderful! Is it a living room? Is it a restaurant? Who can tell? But I guess that's the fun.
Well, I mean what can I say? I, I was married to Barbara for 30 years. She was my high school sweetheart, now you, that's two.
Anyway, she burned all of my clothes. I got away with two things. This suit and what turned out to be a skirt.
Joey, Ross is gonna be here any second, would you mind watching Ben for me while I use the ladies' room?
No. No! You're doing great! Don't you give up! That's why we didn't tell you and we're not gonna drag you down with us.
None. But if there was something you wanted to tell us, we're just gonna be right over there having coffee.
That's fine. Well, your other dad and I are gonna go have a romantic evening and I guess I'll just see you kids around.
Yeah. But then I changed my mind. I'm funny like that. So I told Lizzie, now I'm telling you, I don't want you seeing my daughter anymore.
Well, you know, there's no one way really, it's just, you know, whatever it takes so that you can finally say to him, "I'm over you."
Well then ask yourself this. Why do you think we keep ending up together? New Year's? Who invited who? Valentine's? Who asked who into whose bed?
Oh, just seems as though that maybe you have intimacy issues. Y'know, that you use your humour as a way of keeping people at a distance.
That is a tricky one. Well, Joey I really wanna thank you. You've, well you made a very difficult time for me a little less painful.
Okay, so since umm, you're not going to jail tonight I was wondering if you would like to go to dinner with me?
I don't think you understand packing. Look, I just don't want to leave it to the last minute. Last time I left in such a rush, I left my knickers here.
Oh, no, please, I spent most of mid-morning trying to stand up. Now uh, what can I do for you, my dear?
Well, I would like to propose a toast to the woman, who in one year from today, become Mrs. Dr. Barry Farber DDS
Hey Chan, is that Joey guy gonna come by and pick up his moose hat or should I just toss it out?
Bob is great. He's smart, he's sophisticated, and he has a real job. You, you go on three auditions a month and you call yourself an actor, but Bob...
The thing is it's kinda on the Q.T. The actor who has the part doesn't know he might be fired. It's the lead in a series, Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.
I mean, I knew they were having trouble with this whole thing, but they're my parents. They're supposed to give me away and everything.
There's an open call for Cats. I'm thinking we go down there, sing Memories and make complete fools of ourselves. Whaddya say?
By the way, Chandler. I cut you out of all my pictures. So if you want, I have a bag with just your heads.
I ran into Vlad at the place where they sell the big fish, and he said you played here a lot, so umm....
Yeah, I understand. Take as much time as you want. Ten, even twenty minutes if you need it. I'll be here. Not smoking.
Look, here's what we'll do. We'll put all keys and watches in the hat over there. Alright. Alright, c'mon man, let's do this.
What, you hired the same band I can't use the same speech. Thank you, thank you very much. Anyway, I wish you both a wonderful life together. And Rachel...
Well, I don't think there is anything to do. I mean I think you're really sweet, but I'm just not interested in you like that.
Although, I have enjoyed the fact that, uh your shirt's been stickin' outta your zipper ever since you came back from the bathroom.
I didn't need to know that. I guess 21 years is a lot. I mean, hell, I'm a whole person who can drink older than you.
Oh. Well, so we have to hide our relationship from one more person. Big deal. Besides, it's kinda fun hiding.
I realise that people are going to be disappointed. But, I'm sure they'll come back when we can do it right.
It's just not really who I am. Y'know, I've always been happier when...Why am I telling you this? You don't care about this stuff.
What that Rachel did to her life.... We ran into her parents at the club, they were not playing very well.
Eh, he said, thank you very much, he thinks you look very pretty tonight, your hair, golden like the sun. So you're a chef?
And when you have a second later, I wanna show you why we don't just trap spiders under coffee mugs and leave them there.
Oh it's nothing, it just says that you can't sue the city if you scrap your knee or y'know, get your head blown off.
Hey, it's okay. It was just a car backfire. Hey, look at that! You tried to save your buddy. You see that? You see what he did?
Look, he's a really great guy and I know that you really want this to work out, but I just don't see this having a future.
Aww, look who's being suddenly shy. You can't tell me you don't feel what I feel. Nobody can kiss that good and not mean it.
It's been so long! Last time I saw you, you were setting up your tent in line to see Return of the Jedi.
Really?! Well, that's just lovely, isn't it? I must've missed your call, even though I didn't leave the flat all day.
I'm sorry Mr. Geller. But ya know, there's an old saying, 'Sometimes monkeys die.' It's not a great saying but it certainly is fitting today.
Yeah. I felt a little weird about it. You're a teacher. I'm a student. But would you maybe want to go out with me sometime?
Well, I don't know what's in the boxes down here, but I do know there are six or seven Easy Bake Ovens in the attic.
Oh yeah-yeah, we should get the... So when Jessica kisses a man, she usually puts umm, both her hands on the man's face.
Oh really? Well, then you'd better tell his other wife, 'cause she called three times asking where he is.
Oh, she just graduated, and she wants to be something in cooking, or food, or.... I don't know. Anyway, I told her you had a restaurant-
Hmm, Lipson knows huh? Ahh, hello Mr. Opossum, enigma of the trees, upside-down denizen of the night, taunting gravity with...
Wait-wait-wait-wait! You can put your sad little muffin back in it's drawer. If you must know the truth, I didn't want to lose a perfectly good assistant.
I don't care. I am trying to get a person out of my body here, and you're not making it any easier.
Ooh, sorry little Mr. Chic-A-Dee, sorry you went doody in my hand! Well, I guess we're not going out anymore. Whaa!!!
I think I brought back half of the beach in my hair. It was so much easier when I used to shave my head.
No, no, I am, but only because for the last hour and a half I've been playing the movie Diner in my head.
Finally, I thought we'd never be alone. Can I just tell you something, I have not stopped thinking about you since the party.
No-ho-ho! Yeah. I mean, no-no-no-no-no, don't you worry, I'm sure with your qualifications you won't need to sleep with some guy to get that job. Although, I might need some convincing.
Actually, I'm dating at all anymore. See, I figured out that I was only dating guys that were like y'know bad for me, so until I work that out...
Oh don't be sorry, that's part of your job here to give your opinions and then I take credit for them--I'm kidding.
And I need to flip the light switch on and off 17 times before I leave a room or my family will die.
Well what if somebody steals something? How are you gonna run after him with one leg shorter than the other?!
Well I wouldn't miss it for the world. Oh! I'm getting all misty here! You'd think I was having my legs waxed or something.
I try not to let my work affect my personal life, but it's hard, when you... do what I do. It's like uh...Well, for instance, what do you do?
Oh okay. But y'know what? Be careful. Because a guy was helping me before had to leave because he hurt his back.
okay, but you have to admit that every time we go out... Women we meet at the hospital... It turns into...
Look honey, people get fired left and right in this business. I already got you an audition for Another World.
Well, I'd be forced to file a report. I'd have to consult with the legal department, and your future at the company would be in jeopardy.
Well, um, for the past few years I've been working.. ...which is funny because, that wasn't even my major.
Mushroom. Smile. They won't all be like this. Some women might even stay through dinner. Sorry, that's not funny
So it looks like you've got some great experience here. Let's see ahh, reason for leaving last job?
Oh, hey. I love children, I have children. I just don't want to be 70 when our kids go off to college, and our lives can finally start.
Yeah but maybe that's a good thing. Y'know I'm doing all these different sorts of things, and maybe I should try dating a geek too!
I don't know. Could be because I don't feel like standing around all night waiting for some guy who may or may not scream.
Um, so listen, how many times am I gonna have to touch you on the arm before you ask me on a date.
But... he gets it back, pass to the middle, lines it up and... BAM! Yes! Could that shot BE any prettier?
Did you hear that?! I don't need you guys to care about me! Because the universe cares! The whole universe! I really wished they'd care just a little bit though.
I'll go in a second, I-I just wanted to tell you that there hasn't been a day where I didn't regret giving you up.
It-it's probably just temporary. We're hoping to get some more money soon, so if could just uh, hang out.
And I never used to be able to just talk to girls in bars, but I got like 20 phone numbers last night.
No, he already knows that he owns everything in the room! He's not finding it out for the first time! So, try it again.
Hi. And batting for Sarah, Ross Geller, 872. Although, it looks like you bought an awful lot of cookies yourself.
Filing system? Oh-oh! You mean those-those little colored labels you put on all the folders? It certainly did brighten up the inside of the filing cabinets.
No. The one in Atlantic City, Dad loves the slots. He says he's gonna double the college money my Grandma left me.
Listen Joey, seeing as you've got the most experience, I want you to take these dancers and show them the combination.
Yeah, since the divorce, when anybody asks me how I am, it's always with a sympathetic head tilt. 'How ya doin'? You OK?'
The thing is, I think some of the parents, they were kinda hopin' that you'd play more songs about like, barnyard animals.
Oh that's interesting? Because I checked and only one keycard was used to access the copy machine yesterday during lunch and that keycard belonged to you, Rachel.
Yeah!! Little Leslie is here! We got another one! Oh my God, I can't believe I have two-two children. How scary is that?
Absolutely! But you-you would really feel better about me rejecting you if your actor friend can audition for my movie?
Well, I have to tell you, I was quite impressed with your paper on Pre-Cretaceous fossils. Yeah, it confirmed everything that I have written.
Oh my God. You listen to me, Chandler, you listen to me. One of these times is just gonna be your last chance with me.
Oh look, a standing ovation already! So early in the show. Oh turn around honey; let me see your pretty face.
So Ross was in college and decided to jump at the chance to take a young girl to her high school prom.
Because if you feel uncomfortable with your friend dating someone you work for, there are always ways to fix...that.
And Rachel shouldn't have any problem with that. The only problem might be getting a little too friendly, if you know what I mean.
So basically this is very easy. You read from the script and try to sell as much toner as you possibly can.
No I don't have a ring! You go get her Chandler. And can I give you a piece of advice? If you do get her, don't let her go. Trust me.
People! Last time there were some empty yoghurt containers lying around after class. Let's not have that happen again!
Yeah, stupidly charming isn't' it? Well listen let's, you wanna get something to eat? 'Cause this place is kinda depressing.
Oh, all she said was that I remind her too much of somebody. You have any idea who she's talking about?
This is just so exciting. You know, I never worked. I went straight from my father's house to the sorority house to my husband's house. I am just so proud of you.
Chandler! Come on, I'm gonna show how to roll up your underwear and stuff it in your shoes. It's a real space saver.
...But, you can't actually test this theory, because today's particle accelerators are nowhere near powerful enough to simulate these conditions.
All right, I just got changed in thirty seconds so you can be alone with him. You'd better go for it.
I do. You didn't love Barry. And I've never seen you this happy. I look at you and I think, oh, this is what I want.
So uh well the director is insisting that whoever play that part be authentically, anatomically not Jewish. Do you know what I'm saying?
Okay uh, we have narrowed it down to Raymond, Ben, Kyle, and Joey. The rest of you, thank you very much.
No, you didn't. The only thing that freaked me out was you saying that nothing could ever happen between us.
A piece of something: boxer shorts, greeting cards, and what looks like a half-charred pictureWow, that guy's hairier than the Chief!
Yeah, I... Well I really actually wanted to say umm, that, but um, I figured I probably shouldn't because y'know, I...have to leave.
Hey, buddy! Are you familiar with Section 11-B of the Health Code that requires all refuse material out the back exit?
No it's... Uh, my ex-wife Whitney is out there. I cannot deal with her right now. That woman is crazy!
Oh, you're so funny. Listen, umm, what are you doing after rehearsals? Do you want to get a drink, or something?
Oh, are you sure? Really? Because you know, you could make little puppets out of them, and you could use them in your theater of cruelty.
Hello, I am Guru Saj--Whoa!! That's supposed to be a duck right? 'Cause otherwise, this is waaay out of my league.
Actually, you know, uh, I gotta show this apartment tomorrow and uh, you know, this no faces thing might not be a bad idea.
Okay, well, my cell phone number is right here on the counter, please help yourself to anything in the fridge.
Yeah. Monica, I want you there in the front row when I win. I want you close enough to smell the blood. What do you think?
Aw, no problem dude. Y'know we got to look out for each other. We're the same, you and me.
For what it's worth I did appreciate you standing up for me. It felt really nice. It kinda made me like you even more.
No, no no no, you don't have to tell me anything. You don't have to explain yourself to me. Ooh, who am I to question the great Dr. Drake Remore?
Wait Joey! You didn't need to come down because the director saw your tape from yesterday and loved it.
No, I'm telling you last night was like umm, all my birthdays, both graduations, plus the barn raising scene in Witness.
This doesn't have anything to do with the fact that he is being raised by two women, does it?
Well, if I had to chose right now, which by the way I find really weird, I would have to say, Chandler.
You know, you read about it, you see it in the movies. Even when you practice it at home, man oh man, it is nothing like that.
Yeah, it's-it's my only weird thing, I swear. And I-I-I would've told you about it, but I didn't know they would be here.
Well um, why don't you call me in 20 years and tell me if you're still upset about this.
You'll never believe what just happened, Ross just totally blew me off and he didn't even tell me why!
Yeah, but y'know, I think the reason we're not getting that spin right is because my apartment's too small.
Awww! You know that's probably why babies learn to talk, so they can tell grown ups to cut it out.
There is a revolutionary new product that guarantees that you'll never have to open up milk cartons again. Meet the Milk Master 2000.
So are ready for the gym? They've got this new rock climbing wall, we can spot each other.
Joe, your dad's in love big time. And the worst part of it is, it's with two different women.
Look, look at your man, Ewing. Nice shot. You know what, he couldn't hit water if he was standing on a boat.
Yes! Yeah! Joey has great hair! Umm, I'm basically done here. Just let me get this off your neck.
Oh yeah, well who serves steak when there's no place to sit, I mean how are you supposed to eat this?
Oh yeah, well who serves steak when there's no place to sit, I mean how are you supposed to eat this?
Well, when you do, just let me know. I'll be right over there on the edge of my seat.
Oh great! That special bond again! Why do women have such a problem with the fact that I'm close with my sister?
Well, me and my dancer friends are thinking of doing Thanksgiving uptown. I thought you guys might like to come.
There's nothing to wonder about, Monica. You're gonna go back to being exactly who you were, because that's who you are.
Oh my God. He just gave you the coldest look I have ever seen. It's like he hates you. Then it is true.
Are you kidding? I take credit for Paul. Y'know before me, there was no snap in his turtle for two years.
Well uh, after you ran out on your wedding, Barry's parents told people that you were sort of....insane.
I know I'm no John Bon Jovi, or someone who find attractive, I'm just, I think, y'know, that you might end up feeling differently.
Hey, here's an idea. Why don't uh, I put the food in the fridge and we can eat it later?
Y'know, when I saw you at the store last week, it was probably the first time I ever mentally undressed an elf.
I'm sorry, you're right, I apologize, but I should tell you that I'm waiting for a date. Oh, and there he is now.
Y'know I have a torn rotator cuff, a hairline fracture in my right forearm, and a severely bruised Adam's Apple, but that really hurt.
Well, let's just say if I left 15 years ago, the landscape of Mexican cinema would be very different today!
Well, I knew you had the Rockys, and so I figured, you know, you can wear Bullwinkle and Bullwinkle, or you can wear Rocky and Rocky,or, you can mix and match, moose and squirrel. Whatever you want.
I just got a call to be a dancer on a television special for New Year's Eve. It's called some sort of Dick'n Rock'n Dickie Eve.
All right, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, We've got to do something about our little situation here Joey. So, this is my idea you and me spending some quality time together.
Could you leave a note? 'Cause I'm on a lot of pain killers now, and I don't know if I'll remember this tomorrow.
'Cause Rachel told me uh, you were dying to have a threesome with me and uh, Drew Barrymore. By the way, Drew has some groundrules and...
Do you know what it's like to grow up with someone who is critical of every single thing you say?
We started saving again when you were dating Richard and then that went to hell, so we redid the kitchen.
Is there ah, is there some way they can not be here. It's just ah, farm birds really kinda freak me out!
We're sorry honey, but we just assumed if you got married after you turned 30 you'd pay for it yourself.
Anyway, that's when me and my friends started this whole fruit basket business. We call ourselves 'The Three Basketeers.'
The only person that should feel awkward is you, and you didn't tell him not to call me, did you?
Hey, y'know, Alice is gonna be here so soon, you couldn't just like do me a favor and like, like hold them in?
I'll be there, and who knows, if things go well, maybe this time I'll get to see your underwear.
Y'know it-it's funny, um, Frank told me so much about you, but your not how I pictured you at all.
Oh. Well, I wish I could say no, but you can't stay my assistant forever. Neither can you Sophie, but for different reasons.
Friends. Family. We are gathered to celebrate here today the joyous union of Ross and Emily. Now Ross, repeat after me. I Ross...
This is so much fun, just the girls. You know what we should do? Does anybody have any marijuana?
I seem to have had a slight office mishap. Could you please get the key off the back of the door for me.
I'll bet your thinking, 'What's an intelligent girl who wants to be in fashion, doing making coffee?' Eh?
Well that's uh, that's a good point. Um ok, well, uh, I guess I got the wrong apartment then. I, I'm, look, I'm, ya know, I'm sorry, I'm terriably sorry.
Uh, yeah. Now you guys dance over there, you guys over there, and I want you two right around here, and everyone else spread out.
All right Miss Green, everything looks fine... Yep, I think we're starting to see some real progress here.
Thank you, listen, thanks a lot Tribbiani, . Oh my God, look at the time, I gotta catch the bus to the ball.
I don't know! I just, just do this! I-I always have to pick the like the smartest guy, or-or the most talented guy... Why can't I just pick someone like you?
All rightie, everybody look at me. Good. All right, its time. Bridesmaids and ushers let's see two lines, thank you.
We're very sad that it didn't work out between you and Emily, monkey. But, I think you're absolutely delicious.
We're very sad that it didn't work out between you and Emily, monkey. But, I think you're absolutely delicious.
Pete Becker is circling the ring now. It looks like, he's just trying to feel him out. Oh, Bruiser is just...
Last time I saw you, it was the morning I left for college. And you were just standing outside The Dairy Queen.
Joey, you gotta stay until the end. We can't stop filming just for you. It's not like it's your wedding.
Look, youre cold, I have to pee, and... ..theres a cup of coffee on the window. How bad could it be?
There she is. And over there, that's the other one. This is Mr. Buddy Boyle, Mr. Heckles' attorney. He'd like to talk to you.
And finally that you were unable to consummate the marriage. Well, that makes sense since you're gay and addicted to heroin.
Good runnin' into you at the bank today, so ah, here's my number, 555-9323. Give me a call. Later.
Well, you do realise the odds of that happening are a little slimmer if they never get to meet the guy..
I want to become the Ultimate Fighting Champion! It's the most intense physical competition in the world, it's banned in 49 states!
I dont know. For the past couple days, people have been avoiding me and giving me these really strange looks.
Well I don't know, I-I suppose we may have favored you unconsciously, you were a medical marvel! The doctor said your mother could...
Well, no, maybe-maybe it wasn't perfect, but y'know it was pretty cool, y'know, 'cause we had all those great talks y'know.
OK. You better. Oh God, here we go. Hey wanna see 'em go nuts? Watch this. Who needs glasses?
Just your dad. Although that's actually racquetball. You know I-I do have a blind date with my sister's neighbour next Tuesday.
We'll just grab some food and take it with us right upstairs, and we'll be right out of you hair.
Y'know, I don't think I want the lipstick that much. But umm... Oh, would you do me a favor? And umm, would you, would you give Lilly that, please?
Hello. Hello. How do you do? How do you do? Very nice to meet you. Darling it's the Gellers. Darling, it's the Gellers. She's very self-absorbed, you know. I should never have married her.
Oh, I knew you'd be so cool about this. All right, ah, hey, do you want to meet her?
Oh, my Bing-a-ling. I'll wait for you. Do you even know how long you're going to be gone?
Phoebe, I-I-I-umm, Oops. I just, I-I-I-I don't, I don't know what to say. I just can't believe that you're my daughter, you're so pretty.
I-I've got to go. This has been so great Ray-ray! Oh, there you are. Umm, so listen, just call me. Here's my card.
Okay, everybody, we'd like to get this in one take, please. Let's roll it.. water's working .. and... action.
Ooh, actually I've been making a list of all the women I know who might be into doing this!
Y'know, thanks for trying to cheer me up, but I'm not gonna date some random guy from your work.
Uh, listen um, as long as we're telling stuff, uh, I have another one for you. I'm a little younger than I said.
No, seriously. These hands. These miracle, magical, life-giving hands. Oh, just to be near them, touch them, maybe even lick one?
Excuse me, I'm sorry, you haven't said anything for about two and a half minutes, are you at all interested?
Min. Oh Rach, you're still here, at our wedding, they were packing up the chopped liver about now.
No! Of course we can still hang out with them. Just y'know, not two nights in a row. Okay?
Well, I don't know tonight when they yelled cut and we didn't get to kiss, I was really, really, disappointed, and I just, really wanted to kiss you
Yeah, they teamed us up as partners. Joey picked three scenes for us to do; all of them had us making out.
Yeah! I've been working so hard this semester. I really need to go crazy y'know, blow off some steam.
Wait! I think I see where you're going, but before you say anything else, can I just say one more thing?
Oh, no-no, y'know I absolutely adore Rachel it's just that, well it might be a awkward for you. But it's absolutely your decision. More tea?
: Toby... Oh, for God's sake, I don't know what she's talking about! There's no Rachel! Don't give me that deep freeze.
Sure you did! You came in, you got all awkward, and you ran into the bedroom. You were shouting, "Joey! Joey!" Bye Rach.
Okay. All right. This is what we're gonna call it 'Joey and Janice's DAY OF FUN!'
I left a bra drying on the shower rod, you don't think your son will think it's yours and be horribly traumatised?
So uh, you're not gonna be able to live here for a while, you ladies have a place to stay?
Wow. Y'know we're back where we were. Honey, I would love to do all that, but nothing's changed.
Willya relax? Look around. No pagan altars, no piles of bones in the corners, they're fine. Go like this.
I'm sorry Ray-ray. I mean if I thought it happened I would say it. Maybe I passed out and you did stuff to me while I was sleeping.
Ok, I have to sleep on the west side because I grew up in California and otherwise the ocean would be on the wrong side.
All right girls, and man. Let's see your final tallies. Ohhhh, Debbie, 321 boxes of cookies, Very nice.
Oh, fine. I'm leaving for New York tomorrow, which I hate- but I get to see my son, who I love...
Oh no, not you, big Joey. Oh my God, you're so much cuter than your pictures! I-I'm, I'm Ronni....Cheese Nip?
It really was. Oh, c'mere, sweetheart. Y'know, I think it might be time for you to start using night cream.
We're actually at the end of one of our research cycles, so we're not looking for applicants right now.
I'm sorry... I'm sorry, God, I am so sorry, I'm an idiot, I was weak, I couldn't help myself! Whatever I did, I only did because I love you so much!
It's okay if it bothers you. Really. I mean the only thing I need to know is 'how much it bothers you?' because I don't like wasting my time. Am I wasting my time?
Okay, okay, one thing's changed. But we still want different things and we know how this is gonna end.
Good. Good. Not that we don't want you to stay, obviously you're welcome-How much more homework do you have?
Honey, uh we, we can talk about this. It's just that it's costing about a hundred dollars a minute to be in here.
Hey you guys, umm do either one of you want to get in there before I take my bath.
In fact we're playing a game at the park tomorrow. You're welcome to play too if you want.
I was just coming over here to apologize for my behavior! I'd really like it if we could be friends.
Oh, that sounds lovely. We're gonna have to set that up. Oh, I better get back. Hope the baby feels better.
Yeah? You found them!! Y'know what? I'm not even going to gloat. I'm just really relived this whole thing is over.
Ah, no it's not. I've got picture-in-picture here. Yeah. Yeah, okay. I'm gonna have to call you back later. Monica? You. I'm gonna have to call you back.
...because I have a list of five goofy coffee house guys and yesterday I bumped you for that guy over there.
That would be great! Also, uh, I was hoping to catch a show so if you can make any suggestions...
I can't believe you thought that you were going to video tape us having sex on the first date!
Yeah, y'know when we found out we were going to have a baby, y'know I figured y'know like I should y'know have like a career-and I love refrigerators!
I'm fine! I'd fight tonight, if they'd let me. See this circle I'm marking off here? This is my zone of terror.
Oh, I'm sorry honey, I'm so, so, haaaaa! I'm so, so sorry, I just haaaaaa! But I, oh what happened was, I-I-I can't breathe. Can you get me a bag, or something?
Oh, uh, well, you left your good hair at my apartment, I figured you'd need it tomorrow for your meeting.
Yeah-yeah, it's this huge place, and-and it's got this gorgeous view of the park, and very, very romantic. What do you say?
Aw come on Joey, it's easy. Y'know, it's hand, hand, head, head, up, pas de bouree, pas de bouree, big turn here, grand sissone, sissone, sissone, slide back, step, step, step, and jazz hands!
See, about a month ago, I wanted to hurt you. More than I've ever wanted to hurt anyone in my life. And I'm an orthodontist.
Well, maybe I'll bring it out and have Monica stick her finger in it. That oughta sweeten it up, huh?
Yes, that's very good. Now a uh, big part of this job is cultivating personal relationships, especially with designers.
Actually, he is getting closer on the talking thing. He can't quite say mama yet, but once he said yumen.
Well yeah! ...Oh God. I- just- I thought- Good, Shelley. I'm just gonna go flush myself down the toilet now... Okay, goodbye...
That's right Wesley! I just stopped by to say that, you're not a real doctor! And that woman's brain, is fine!
I used to umm, schedule my classes so I could watch Dr. Drake Remoray on Days of Our Lives.
Joey, all the roles got to dance a little. But believe me with your dance background it'll be a piece of cake.
Speaking for my people, I'd have to say no. By the way, your friend Brian from Payroll, he is.
So it's down to these two, Nancy I know you like this one and I think I agree. Rachel, what do you think?
Uh, listen Bing, I received your memo. So, we're not gonna receive the systems report until next Friday?
Oh, that's so great! Okay, I'm really gonna do this! I don't know how to thank you guys.
Hold on, y'know I just got a box of Cubans, maybe I bring them by your office around uh, five?
Well I was thinking it would be um, kind of sexy if you wore mine tonight, at dinner.
You know, Junior Miss is where I started. Oh, I had to sleep with the ugliest guy to get that job.
Oh, my major was totally useless. I mean, how often do you look in the classifieds and see "Philosopher wanted"?
Yeah, if I have to. Monica, I don't wanna lose you, so if I have to do it all over again, then I will.
Not as impressive as you. I gotta tell you, I looked at your record and you've done some pretty weird stuff.
I mean hey! I just met you, I don't know you from Adam. ...Only child, right? Parents divorced before you hit puberty.
And y'know what I said to him? "I'm gonna hire a lawyer and I'm gonna sue you and take all your money. Then I'm gonna cut you off!"
Ahh, is it hot? My body always stays cool, probably 'cause I have so much skin. Hey, cheese!
Thanks for letting me stay here! I mean Monica's place was nice, but her fiancee sure stares a lot.
Oh look, you don't have to give it too me right now! You can slip it under my door.
This witness won't return my calls so we're gonna see if we can surprise him coming home.
I am telling you, up until I was, like nine, I thought that gunpoint was an actual place where crimes happen.
Ah, oh, hang on a second. Come in, come in. All right, so think about it, and call me back.
Well, you've got a little scratch on your cornea, your gonna have to wear a patch for a couple of days.
You are really good at that. So uh, I had fun tonight, you throw one hell of a party.
I'm Dr. Miller. Monica told me you were a little nervous, but don't worry everything's gonna be just fine.
Oh well, um, your, your laundry just smelled so good, that I thought I'd curl up in it. Is that all right?
I guess the last time we really hung out was when our parents rented that beach house together.
Well! Well! Well! Joey Tribbiani! So you came back huh? They think they can do better but they all come crawling back to Estelle!
Kidding! I'm gonna get there early, but I'm going to put you on the V.I.P list, okay? Look for me.
So Monica let me ask you a question. Y'know, since we broke up do you ever, think about me?
No, it isn't, because you won't let that happen. Don't you know it yet? You love me, Chandler Bing.
I should just go on to happier things, okay? Umm, why don't you tell about your lovely wedding?
Do you remember when you first came here, how you spent two weeks getting trained by another waitress?
Yeah! You're saying, you need to be with someone more mature. Maybe someone with, a license to practice medicine. Or a mustache.
I've gotta call my friend Mary and tell her how good this is, from Monica's room.
You are falling fast asleep. Deeper. Deeper. Deeper. You are now completely asleep. You don't need to smoke. Cigarettes don't control you. You are a strong, confident woman, who does not need to smoke. A strong, confident woman.
Well it's somewhere in between. You see, in a strictly technical sense, of course, I'm not uh..., well I, I mean I haven't ever uh...
Now maybe you just like wanna but the whole duck in there! Who cares, y'know? Now I got the legs...
Okay, okay... when Barry was engaged to you, he and I...kind of... had a little thing on the side.
And the advances in collating in the past five years, I mean we just got in an X-5000, y'know. The X-5000 makes the X-50 look like a T-71.
Ugh, well I will just have to soak up every once of Chandler Bing until that moment comes.
Don't do that to yourself. Any one of us could have tripped over that little girls jump-rope.
Yeah, but you can come and visit me. I bet that you could uh, own a few places down there.
Hi. I don't mean this to sound like high school, but did he say anything about me?
Y'know why? She's got the Christmas bonus list in there. I saw her working on it this morning.
Great! Dad! Thank you so much, I'll be back to pick him up in an hour.
Right, not just that. Umm, even though we love each other as much as we do, none the less...
Please! I have people coming from out of town today! And, I told them all about your candy!
Ross and Emily have made their declarations and it gives me great pleasure to declare them husband and wife.
Ross and Emily have made their declarations and it gives me great pleasure to declare them husband and wife.
Excuse me for a moment, will you please, I want to say good night to the Levines, before we go.
Ross, I think you misunderstood what I was saying. I just wanted to tell you that I'm going to Florida for a couple weeks.
Okay, here's where we go to the live shot of Times Square, nice work everyone that's a wrap!
Ohh, well. Y'know we were always together, in fact the had a nickname for the three of us.
So he's got a doll? So what? Unless you're afraid he's gonna grow up and be in show business.
They never did, so if ever see me giving them legal advice just nod along. Shall we?
God, this was really fun! I've been wondering if you were going to ask me out.
So based on your petition you are seeking an annulment on the grounds that Mr. Geller is mentally unstable.
Oh come on we went, we went to Time Square, we found ninja stars, I almost got arm broken by a hooker...
Listen to me. If you think sleeping with Ralph is going to get you my job. You are sadly mistaken.
Oh, Bob, he was nothing compared to you. I had to bite my lip to keep from screaming your name.
Of course you did. Look Ross, you can't get an annulment unless you and Rachel are both there.
Ahh, the bat. Ambassador of darkness, flitting out of his cave like a winged messenger, sightless spectre of the macabe.
Here's what's gonna happen. The music's gonna start, you're gonna dance, we're gonna tape, you don't look at the camera. Any questions?
Honey, you are not an oat. I, I mean I don't know, I, I guess I'm just not an oat guy. I've only slept with women I've been in love with.
I wasn't by myself. I had a doctor, a nurse, and a helper guy. So, did you see who won the game?
Yes, yes Monica is thin. It's wonderful. But what we really want to hear about is Ross's new girlfriend.
Oh, no-no-no, it's a good one! Fonzie plays the bongos. All right, are you ready? It's time to start pushing.
I know. OK, I wasn't completely honest with you when I told you that, uh, I didn't know exactly where he lived.
Um-hmm, and did you stay up all night in preparation for your sleep study. Uh, sir?
But you should probably talk to my roommate, because I told him and he knows Phoebe too.
Oh honey, come on, have a sense of humour, you've never been able to laugh at yourself.
The library board has had a lot of complaints from parents about some of the stuff in your songs.
Dr. Farber, we've got a bit of an emergency here...Jason Costalano is choking on his retainer.
Totally, I love them! And, maybe you could finish telling me about all the different kinds of sand.
And we'll need to have witnesses who can testify that you were not of uh, sound mind.
I'm telling you, it's a wonder your mother turned out to be the positive, life-affirming person that she is.
Oh, like I'd give up that job! Free popcorn and candy, anytime I want. I can get you free posters for your room.
You know, we're all wondering who this Rachel is. Can you point her out to me?
Well, I gotta buy a vowel. Because, oh my Gawd! Who, would've thought that someday, Chandler Bing would buy me a drawer.
Uh, Phoebe we've been getting complaints and uh, we're gonna move you to a less high-profile spot.
Well, you see, the-the thing is, we-we only got, we kinda have one shot to make it right.
The Empty Vase is not about you. My baby, you make me so sad that you would think this.
Well maybe you can date him then that would save me the trouble of killing him. Are you okay?
Hey Joey, we're ready for ya! Joey, this is Alex he's going to be playing your son.
Remember when you were a little kid, I used to take you to the navy yard and show you the big ships?
The woman I love is having a baby today. I've been waiting for this just as much as you have.
Our next item is the romantic trip to Paris. It goes to Emil Alexander high a high bid of 2,300.
I know I didn't do well on my midterms and stuff but, I was kinda hoping you could change my grade.
Okay, so let me just get this straight. You're accusing me of cheating on you, and insulting my performance?
So how are you? I've been meaning to ring you ever since I arrived but umm, well, I've been rather busy.
I hope you can find some way to be happy for me. And I hope you'll still be my maid of honor...?
And if that person is already in your life, you should do something about it right?
Mister Pretensous, you think there's no one finer, well but your poems are unpublished, and you work in a diner.
Hi. God, it seems like just yesterday you guys used to come out to watch me work.
Well Joey doesn't like to talk about it but, he's one of the stars of Days Of Our Lives.
Yeah, um, I was over there, then you said, "Excuse me, hello Miss," so now Im here.
He happens to be brilliant. Which is more than I can say for that sweater you're dating.
Well, here we sit, devil may care, just a little while ago you were reattaching someone's spinal cord.
No! Look, I was gonna tell you this over dinner, but I met somebody else. On my trip.
'Cause you're a little princess! "Daddy, buy me a pizza. Daddy, buy me a candy factory. Daddy, make the cast of Cats sing Happy Birthday to me..."
Oh, sure, yeah. This is the one of you father in a meadow, and, uh, helping a little boy fly a kite, and here he is at a graduation. . . another graduation. . . another graduation.
Listen, I-I guarantee you keep your job if you can teach me how to talk to women like you do.
I mean, I can't-I can't be in the same room as her! It drives me mad just thinking of you being in the same room as her!
Hey don't take it personal, he's under a lot of pressure, ya know, starring in a movie and all.
You have a very impressive resume, Ms. Green. I especially like what I see here about implementing a new filing system.
It's nice to see you're not still wearing that denim cap with all the little mirrors on it.
No! Thank you! Monica, and Ross! I don't know what I'm gonna do about the two of you!
Yeah. I mean y'know, we haven't been going out that long. Come on, we haven't even slept together yet. Huh.
Oh, I know and he's soo sweet! Listen, he said he was going to call, so put him straight through.
Well you kids talk about this place so much, we thought we'd see what all the fuss is about.
Did you know your mother spent $1200 dollars on bansai trees. I felt like Gulliver around that place.
A little birdie told me something about you wanting to rip your arm off and throw it at me.
Oh, sorry about that stuff hanging in there. It's just my thongs are too delicate for the dryer.
I know I haven't worked in an office before, and I really don't have a lot of experience, but uh...
Well, I gotta tell ya Bing; that partner of yours is a real tiger. Are you all right sweethart?
Ross, umm, you've been in there for a long time. I'm starting to get kinda freaked out.
That's right. Mr. Ford is a very good customer, he brings us a lot of clothes; you bring us nothing!
Oh, wait, no your right, no it was perfect and I can't believe that I screwed it up so bad.
She's probably not even very pretty, just young enough so that everything is still pointing up.
You're a very sweet person Ross, umm, unfortunately I don't think I can take another second of you whining!!
That guy has been waiting for his coffee for ten minutes! He's complained about you three times!
Hold it. I'm sorry, the surprise is a new swing set, if you could play it a little less...intense?
Ross. You're not actually suggesting Helen Willick-Bunch-Geller? 'Cause I think that borders on child abuse.
I love the way you look every night Chandler! That's why I made you this tape! Happy Birthday! Love Janice!
There's no way he smells, he's the only one around here with a shower in his dressing room.
Oh, 'scuse me. So Ross, uh, how's the wife? Off there too, uh? Uh, Chandler, quick, say something funny!
No! That's just the "Hey Guy" guy. He says that to everybody! He's the worst! I'd like to take him with me!
Oh, I think I see the problem. And I'm afraid we're gonna have to use a much stronger tool. Love.
Which means you had seven years of beach fun and you can't put a price on that sweetie.
I don't know about the hands, but the guy that was here before me just went to the bathroom.
How come all I can think about is putting that ice in my mouth and licking you all over?
I mean, this is no offense to your dad, sweetie, but I was thinking there might be more.
Oooh, c'mon, shut up, it's fun. Gimme a hug. Well, I think we're ready for some tequila.
Maybe. I was thinking about getting a cat, I was just going to go to the shelter but... Okay, why not?
We don't have 50 bucks, but would you be willing to trade for it? We've got a canoe.
Well, Adrian's looking for a reason to stay, right? Victor can't just kiss her, he's gotta, gotta really give her a reason, y'know?
Uh, actually, actually, I'm having a party at my place on Saturday, it's sort of a house warming kind of thing.
Woah, woah, no wait a minute now. C'mon it's your turn. Oh c'mon. Ya know, I don't need the actual number, just a ballpark.
I'd love to ask you in, but uh, my sister's visiting and I think she's asleep on the couch.
We were having lunch. Yeah and then all of the sudden we were like, "Hey! Y'know, we're here, having lunch let's get married!
Well then, uh, I uhh, guess that's me. Anyone else need to go on the elevator? Dr. Horton, Dr. Wong?
That was good, that was really good. But I-I think your hands maybe a little off, they should be maybe right like...
I know, that's what I kept telling myself but you just reach a point where you can't live a lie anymore.
Yes. Well, Mr. Kostelick wants you to stop by his office at the end of the day.
Well, we were in the city shopping, and your mom said you work here, aaand it's true!
I was passin' by and I saw that you were playing tonight, it's kinda cool seeing you up there.
Yeah, it happened to me once. I was just flipping through the channels and bam! It was like finding money.
Fortunately, I won't. And by the way, it seems to be perfectly clear that you were on a break.
Hot coffee!!! You idiot!! You were gonna spill hot coffee all over me, huh?!! What are you just some big, dumb, stupid, doofy idiot, with a doofy idiot hairdo, huh?! Huh?!
Honey.. you should always feel the thing. Listen, if that's how you feel about the guy, Monica, dump him!
Acting! Chandler, this is my job! I'm-I'm playing a part in a play! How can you not trust me?!
Right. He's not angry at the room either. Try it again, he owns it! He owns the room. It is his. He owns, owns, owns, owns the room! He owns it!! All right, it's a little weird, but it's getting better. Oh well, I'm gonna miss this woman so much. I don't know what I'm going to do! I mean, it's been 20 years of my life.
We know how expensive weddings can be, besides this may be the only wedding we get to throw .
Miss Waltham, is at the rehearsal dinner and it's not polite to make fun of people. Goodbye.
Are you thinking about me? Of course you're not, but if you are, call me tonight. Okay, bye.
Look, forget the check, okay. I like you. I think you're great. Come on, what do you say?
Okay, um, don't take this the wrong way, but your place kinda has a weird smell.
Monica, why don't you finish off these pies? I don't have any more room left in the fridge.
Ah, that's OK, come on in. Um, I'm sorry, is Monica Geller coming? I was told she was.
Say uh, Bing, did you hear about the new law firm we got working for us?
That's very interesting, ya know, 'cause that's exactly what someone who slept with her would say.
I know! Why don't you get drunk! That worked for a lot of girls in my high school.
Question. You're not dating anybody, are you, because I met somebody who would be perfect for you.
No. No. No. Okay, now, see, I wanna name the girl baby Leslie, and Frank wants to name one of the boy babies Frank JR. JR.
Well then you can't have any. Bear overboard! I think he's drowning. Hey fellows! Grab on a Sugar-O... save yourself! "Help! I'm drowning! Help!"
And then after decided to forgive you, seeing you at the airport catching our plane with her.
Let's try it again, and this time let's watch everybody watch Joey. Show 'em how it's done. Count it off.
Oh, she doesn't come down here any more. You can find her up on ten.
No. You have got it completely wrong. John Savage was deerhunter, no legs, John Voit was coming home, couldn't feel his legs.
I don't know, what's a koondis with you? Please, lie down! I've got a sav that oughta shrink that right up.
Yeah, that's my job. Alright, look up. . . look down, now open your eyes, now look down. That's right, look into the light. Now look at me. . . OK. Your eyes look good. Those are good eyes.
Wow! Uh, this is kind of embarrassing. I was actually coming over to talk to your friend.
No, no, no. We were there last night. She kept... ..bringing swordfish. are you gonna go to the, um?
Monica and Rachel had syrup, now I can get my man to cheer up. Good morning Joey.
That info-mercial! For the milk carton spout thing! You're-you're-you're the guy that doesn't know how to pour milk!!
Ehh, y'know after high school, you just kinda lose touch. Oh yeah! I ran into Richard Dorfman.
Oh umm, uh we don't sell cigarettes, but they have them at the newsstand across the street.
Yeah. Y'know we-we talked about just living together, but um, we want to have kids right away.
Congratulations on your first week at your brand new job! It won't be long before your the boss.
That reminds me of you so much, I mean umm, it-it's actually of Lenin. But, y'know at certain angles...
Word on the street - well, when I say street, I mean those little pretend streets they have here at the zoo.
It's gonna be an open casket, y'know, so at least I'll- I get to see him again.
...and even though none of the other kids believed me, I swear to God, that duck pushed me!
Well, I was just wondering about the mother-to-be, but.. thanks for sharing. Uh, lie back..
Take your shirt off, and let's see what we're dealing with here. What are you doing?
Well I actually, I-I really, I haven't seen her for years. But umm, well I-I was pretty tight with-with her and her daughter.
Hey, you keep pushing me on this, my foots going to meet the middle of your ass.
This ring is from the 1920s, it's a one and a half carat diamond with sapphires on either side.
Alright. Now I would like to see you wearing nothing but them. Take your clothes off.
Oh, hey, man I know, doesn't matter how much we love 'em, monogamy is too cruel a rule.
Well, uh, sometimes I think about selling my practice, we could move to France, make French toast.
How are you Ms. Hot Shot chef with the big fancy restaurant with the best chicken ever!
No, no, no, she's nice but, y'know, it just it made me realize that I'm just not, I'm just not ready to be dating, y'know?
Of course! I'm-I'm sorry. I-I'd hate you to miss anything like that on account of me. I can do this!
Thomas, this is gonna be hard, but I wanted it to come from me, and nobody else.
Oh, Net Usage Statistics, right. Gotcha, gotcha. Wont happen again. I wouldnt want to do anything to hurt your... "wenus."
No. That's not what I'm saying. I just may know a few things that might help you inflict some pain.
Yep! I sure know how to pick 'em, huh? Y'know I gave up a part on a soap for this!
Huh. Oh, boy! Uhh, I-I don't wear suits to work, and I bought six of them from you.
That's what real actors do! Annunciation is the mark of a good actor! And when you enunciate, you spit!
Alright, lets see if you're as good in person as you are on paper. Make me a salad.
Well he left four years ago so we're expecting him back any minute now.
Then I made the mistake of turning off the TV, I never got it back again. And I'm sad.
You know, ever since I was little, I've been able to pick up quarters with my toes.
So is there like a story or do they just stard doing it right. . . oh, never mind.
Okay, you got your free food! You ruined everyone's fun! Don't you think it's time you went home?!
If anyone asks, we'll just say Ben addressed them. Oh! So you invited Rachel then?
I'm Susie Moss. Fourth grade, glasses, I used to carry around a box of animal crackers like a purse.
You spend half your life in the bathroom, why don't you ever go out the bloody window!
You spend half your life in the bathroom, why don't you ever go out the bloody window!
I appreciate this soo much, I've been trying to go out with this guy for like a month.
Well, we kissed. I-I-I didn't initiate the kiss, but-but I also didn't stop it, and I've been feeling guilty.
Wha-, n-, no. I mean it's just a bunch of pretty people runnin' around on the beach, ya know.
You get to be the baby's father. Everyone knows who you are. Who am I? There's Mother's Day, there's Father's Day, there's no... Lesbian Lover Day.
She's upstairs. Monica! Come down! Everyone's here! Ross, Rachel, and the boy who hates Thanksgiving.
I'm so glad you could come Chandler, we've got plenty of food so I hope you're hungry.
We're beginning to see a lot of layering of sheer fabrics and colours. For instance a sheer navy blouse over a pink....
No, unfortunately Lizzie's mom passed away shortly after she was born. I raised her by myself.
I don't like looking foolish. Y'know what? Maybe uh, I don't arrest you today. Maybe I came by and you weren't here.
Okay, that's great, but can we make it smaller? Can we make it fit on the head of a pin? I love when we make things fit on the head of a pin.
Phoebe hang on a second Ross wants to say something. What? You slept with someone else?!
Oh, I hate you, I'm pushing my Aunt Roz through Parrot Jungle and you're having sex! So? Who?
I'm not very fond of New York. Queens I like. Ooh, what is this sparkle something! Honey! Huh?
Look, I just saw my best friends brains smeared across the canvas, that's not gonna be me, not me.
That's fine, actually I'm on the hiring committee, so there'll be at least one friendly face.
And the next time you cater for me, there will be nothing but ice in the freezer.
Yeah! I mean you're-you're beautiful and smart and sophisticated-a lot of this isn't based on tonight.
Oh, yeah, right. There was a break-in, few months back, inside job. Your monkey was taken.
Yeah, I do. Of course, I learned at my aunt's dog grooming shop, but hey, what do you say?
Y'know I-I thought it was gonna be weird, I mean I almost called and canceled, but it really isn't.
Look, I dont see why I should have to miss out on the coaching training just because I'm a woman.
Well, the director thinks you're really right for the part and wants to meet you tomorrow.
Oh, well obviously you know Barbara and I split up, otherwise you wouldn't have done the head tilt.
Well, I y'know, I was just, umm, I was just thinking and hoping, that umm, maybe you'd want to get back together?
Yeah, well, I had a 24-inch waist. You lose things. Now come on, get outta my way.
Oh, he's fine. He's fine. It's just that us getting along is difficult for him, because he doesn't like me.
Okay, here are the tips for this morning. Jen gets 50, 50 for me, and Joey owes eight dollars.
It really was. There was this great little pastry shop right by my hotel. There you go, dear.
Well, say no more. Y'know it takes guts to bring this up. Bing! You're okay.
This is where Ross and I are meeting for our date. So, what do you think?
Do you realise that we have not seen each other since the night of that U2 concert?
Yeah, people get pretty generous around the holidays. And it never hurts to wear tight trousers.
Oh, I wish. Look, honey, you have that report to finish, and I gotta go see my lawyer.
Maybe, before the game we could enjoy some eight year old some small batch Basel Hadens.
Thank you. I'd like to start with a song that I wrote for the first man I ever loved. Zachary.
No, I-I actually thought it was unfair the way everyone reacted. I mean you had just moved in.
No, it's okay. We're-we're gonna have three kids! And that's-that's a different kind of dream. Three kids and no money.
So once they caught on to the fact that we're, y'know, short and have breasts...
So, what are you guys in the market for? We've got uh, scarves, tulip post cards...
Oh, that was the blind date that I told you about, she called and switched it to today.
I don't know. They-they must be your mother's, but please, please don't ask her. I'll throw these away.
Now-now calm down. Come look in my office, some of it my still be in the trash.
Now-now calm down. Come look in my office, some of it my still be in the trash.
I'm sorry, is this the same Rachel who's name you said at the altar in the second marriage?
Oh, Ross, listen to me. I have sold a hundred million copies of my books, and y'know why?
He's the kind of guy you're friends with, y'know? But he's not the kind of guy you date. He's the kind of guy you'd date because you did. Me, not so much.
Well, I went over to Kyle's last night to pick up a few things and we got to reminiscing...
Hey! So since we're getting off early, do you want to go and paint mugs?
Yeah, so we just thought we'd stop by and let you know there's still no pressure.
Liam, do me a favour. Tell the lads to go easy on Ross, it's his first time.
Okay, but isn't sex better when it's with one person that you really, really care about.
You guys make me fly! High! Okay, we're gonna pick it up here, tomorrow.
Ah, it's not so much you, you were fat, you had your own problems. But you? What a bitch!
Cool, alright. So maybe, ya know, I could give you a call sometime, we could talk or somethin'.
Then we went to this bar and he hooked us up with all these women!
Monica... Hey Mon, I have a question. Is Leroy the baddest man in the whole damn town or the fattest man in the whole damn town?
Hey, y'know I was thinking, what are the odds like if-if, if you stuff like 200 of them in there?
Well no, just-just that one. But, it was stupid. Let's see, how did it, how did it go. Umm.
Ohh, here comes my dad and stepmum. Mister and Misses Geller, this is Steven and Andrea Waltham.
Well um, I was in ah Mrs. Knight's ah, I mean Alice, sorry, Alice, I always do that. I was in her ah, Home Ec class.
Presenting the award for Favorite Supporting Actress is Joey Tribbiani from Days of Our Lives.
Ohh... Oh! You were not meant to see me before the wedding. It's bad luck.
I have just resigned my post. Would you care to accompany me to the Rainbow Room? I have diplomatic coupons.
This where they put it? What, there no table available in the kitchen! Hello, baby.
He's gonna go up to the counter with Citizen Kane, Vertigo, and Clockwork Orgy. This is nice.
..a sound Mom and Dad never forget. For this after all, is the miracle of birth.
Well, this isn't how I was hoping how this would end, but I guess I have to appreciate your honesty.
Oh Drake, you are so talented, let me see those hands. Oh these hands, these beautiful hands, oh I could just eat them. . . but I won't.
Uh, Phoebe, I don't think your mom would want you to see what's about to happen.
A 98. I deducted 2 points because you are not wearing your chef's hat, and that is a Section 5 violation.
Alright, so now you're doing this whole book tour thing, how is that going?
I've probably been talking too much. Why don't we talk about you a little bit?
Over here Jack. OK. I see, Rachel's coming up the path. Oh doesn't she look pretty. Jack, get this.
How can you do this too me?! I thought I'd made my feelings about Rachel perfectly clear!
Well that's all right, you can come up to the front and dance with me.
Look at this, it's from the cellars of Ernest and Tova Borgnine, so how could we resist?
Well, it's not out here. Is there any chance it could be in your office?
Amber, I want you to know that I'll always be there for you, as a friend and as your brother.
Yeah he's no good. Do you ever think about me in a non-eye doctor way?
Oh no, these dresses are all so amazing but there is no way I could afford one.
Oh. Speaking of whom, I hear he's got some 20-year-old twinkie in the city.
It's from Rachel. She said that she loved the present, and she will see you when you get back.
Y'know what? That's okay, you guys have ordered so many that this one is on me!
I'll feel better when I'm there, and I can know where you are all the time.
Well, I think uhh, someone out there may have been bad mouthing you all over town.
I can't believe you really walk alone here! I mean, you hear such stories about New York.
Chandler, we've been here for an hour doing this! Now watch, it's easy.
That was Alice's mom, she said she left five hours ago. She should be here by now!
I uh, I gotta tell you man, I mean, that's uh, it's kinda out of the blue, I mean don't you think?
OK, now before I go, does anybody else need to be picked up? I'm still gonna go.
...No. I think some things are better left unsaid. I think it's nicer when people just get along.
Yeah, that would be fantastic! My-my nephew is crazy about the Knicks! This is fantastic, thank you so much Rachel.
Joey Tribbiani! I'm surprised your big head could fit through our small halls! I gotta go Joey.
Hi. Well, look, I was just gonna leave a message, isn't tonight your, your big anniversary dinner?
Oh no! But I just walked past three sales and I didn't go in. How strong am I?
Oh, look at us! Who would've thought that Cupid had a station at 14th Street Nails.
Well, if that's what you want. I'll just put it all in my room.
Uuh, before we get into any staying-over-stuff, there is something you should know.
Joey Tribbiani. Yes, ok. Hold on. She wants to talk to you. Take the phone.
No! Y'know what Rachel? You're right, y'know he has been really nice to me.
Oh. No, no, he is so smart. He'll figure it out. Do you want some chicken?
Ross, there is absolutely no way this is going to come off unless you start to...
So Chandler, you're parents must've been thrilled when you told them you were engaged.
It's so cool man, it's so, it's just 'cause being with her is so much better than like not being with her.
Is it yours? Ha! You wish, Chandler Bing. You are looking at a married lady now.
Oh, this is log I kept, recording her every movement. Do you wanna here something from it?
Well there really wasn't much time to get used to it, you know what I mean?
Ah, just some basic dehydrating of a few fruits and vegetables. MAN ALIVE this thing's fantastic!
I'm very interested to find out who's been doing her taxes these last four years.
Someone was in the lady's room, I couldn't wait. I left the lid up for ya though.
I don't think we need to, because you're tripping me out right now! Are you okay?
Okay! Feel free to look, but I'm telling you those contracts are not on this desk.
We are gathered here today to join Joanne Louise Cunningham and Charles, Chachi-Chachi-Chachi, Arcola in the bound of holy matrimony.
Don't worry, Hoshi taught me how to use an opponent's strength and weight against him.
Oh, wait, I remember, she also said she wanted to sleep with me one last time.
Could you uh, could you lower your script? I need to see your face so I can uh, play off your reaction.
Well, he better not come by here. He can't see the bride in the wedding dress.
Wait! Wait! I wanna see this. After I divorce him, half of that kingdom is gonna be mine.
So that's two boxes of the Holiday Macaroons. On behalf of the Brown Birds of America, I salute you.
Nice to meet you. I wish you'd told me we were having company, I'd fix myself up!
Okay, I'm afraid to say this, but let's pick it up where we left off.
Oh, is it the swearing? I mean is it the constant swearing? Because I gotta tell ya, if it is, you can just... kiss my ass!
Comin' out. Place your bet. Dice are out. Double or nothin'! Pay the front line!
Well don't be, because now everything's screwed up. I just want it the way it was.
Ohhh, are you a puppy! Contact paper! I never really know what to say when someone you're sleeping with gives you contact paper.
And then right, right when the scene ends, he could take her with this raw, animal....
Remember the class play? You, you pulled up my skirt and the entire auditorium saw my underpants.
But your chin here. Now, you'll feel a small puff of air in each eye.
Sweetheart, just gimme- gimme another chance, okay, we'll start all over again. We'll go back to Aruba.
Well, ever-ev-... ever since she left me, um, I haven't been able to, uh, perform. ...Sexually.
Oh. Oh my God. How can this be happening? What are we going to do?
And his opponent, from Hunnington Beach, California! He's a 300 pound street fighter, Tank Abbottttttt!!!!
Oh yes, well there's the coffee too. Rachel can carry two things at once!
Would you mind spending some time on my siadic area, it's been killing me today.
No, but it'll be OK, they're pretty cool, my brother's straight so. . .
Well if you're asking me to quit, then you're asking me to be someone I'm not. I've got to do this.

noth i was i was just saying to my
sorry i wa i was just saying to my friend that i thought you were the most beautiful woman that id ever seen in my in my life and then he said that you said you thought
daryl hannah was the most beautiful woman that hed ever seen in his life and i said yeah i liked her in splash a lot but not so much in in wall street i thought she had kind of a
hard quality and uh while daryl hannah is beautiful in a conventional way you are luminous with a kind of a delicate grace then uh thatthatthats when you started yelling
but you cant actually test this theory because todays particle accelerators are nowhere near powerful enough to simulate these conditions
uh thats definitely a uh valid question and uh the answer would be yes yes i was but see i wanted it to be this phenomenal kiss that happened at this phenomenal moment because well cause its you
right but see the longer i waited the more phenomenal the kiss had to be and now weve reached a place where its just gotta be one of those things where i just like sweep everything off the table and throw you down on it and uh im not really a uh sweeping sorta fella
rrrreally
okay okay okay yknow what this was just really expensive and ill take this was a gift
okay what the hell what the hell you want me to actually throw you or youyou wanna just hop
