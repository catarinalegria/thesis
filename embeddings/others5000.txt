What?! You say that to kids?!!
Ohh, well, this is just perfect!
Yeah Phoebe, I completely understand.
Oh, look, wish me luck!
Yeah, I forget which ones.
Oh, howd she take it?
Thank you. Thank you. I love you.
Ross! Stop it! Come on!
Say hi to Wally.
Yeah, and not a very good one.
...I mean it's my fault.
Joey asked me marry him.
He carries a briefcase.
Wow that was a big one.
Amazingly, that makes sense.
Oh what do you know? Virgin!
Oh... Oh boy... Hi...
What college was that Dina?
Oh-oh Professor Geller.
Aw, honey, that's so sweet.
Oh! Molly! You're not Ross.
Ah, Paolo, this is Phoebe.
Oh, I think I saw some in here.
Wow, you guys, this is big.
Honey that sounds like fun.
Yeah, I'm not talking about her...
Just washing the windshield.
Ross, why didn't you tell me that?
OK, OK, it's my turn.
Because, I wanted to hurt you.
Oh honey, but it is just about...
Ok, so let's talk money.
Is he romantic with her?
I think he's across the hall.
What do you, what do you mean?
Wow! I did not see that coming.
Hey, what's-what's going on?!
Well, it was all Ross's idea.
I didn't know there were docks.
Well, y'know, sometimes that helps.
Thank you. So are we good?
Hi, this is my friend Rachel.
Well, I would like to have the option!!
Well no, I don't smell anything.
Joey! Come here! Come here!
It's open! Hi, Joe!
Yeah. A year ago..
I don't want you to see me naked!
It's a uh, regatta gala.
I don't know where the phone is.
My God! What happened to you?
Awww, just like his daddy.
Just sit over there!!
What?! You got us evicted!!
Ohh, honey no problem. Okay.
Ohhhh, sorry I missed that.
Oh stupid metric system!
Oh! I knew it! What happened?
I'm just going to grab the phone.
Oh! What's new in sex?
Tag? Hi, who was that?
Three of your five, what?
Chandler, you have an assistant right?
What? Yeti-I mean Danny?
No! I'm so happy for them!
Excuse me. It's about the job.
What?! She made the tea!
Have you been working out?
Fine! We'll ask Phoebe.
Well... Umm, I got TiVo.
"Oh, my, god."
Her dancer friends?
Ha, I made you look....
Nothing. I don't want to do anything.
Ohh, and the nicest girlfriend!
I didn't know you guys hung out.
Oh. Right. ...Oh great.
Ross, you're like my best friend.
Let me see that. Oh, yeah.
That is the Coast Guard.
Then what? What do you want?
Well, then can we meet him?
Well, h-how is this like that?
Hello? Oh, Pheebs! It's Phoebe!
Did you just break the radiator?
Okay. Let's use this brush.
Hey he's wearing a sweater.
Not uh, not to my recollection.
Why?! What?! Are you kidding?!
No, you wait! This is ridiculous!
She asked-asked you out again?
Monica's gonna marry a millionaire!!!
Where the hell've you been?
We won. We won!
Thank you...we're so excited!
All right Ross!! I get it!!
Well try to keep it down.
Well then I can't tell you what I know.
Oh. Oh my God, is that Phoebe?
So what are you guys going to do?
Oh yeah. That's a great story.
You are soo enjoying this.
What are you, what are you doin'?
Okay fine, what do you have?
We'll be right back sir.
Oh my God! That is so good!
So you know how to fix it?
You want me to see a therapist?
No Joe, no miracle.
Okay, don't listen to him. Please?
Say more things like that.
I don't really care about the Knicks.
Do I have my own castle?
What? You really think she's hot?
Oh-oh! Okay, she's kicking!
What thing? What is this thing?
Come on! I think this is funny!
I'm-I'm sorry, I just thought that...
Hey, I thought that guy was married.
Um, Mon, Chandler's not here.
Oh, he's just goofing around.
Ooh, your brother. Score!
We're paying for this y'know.
I know, I still need to talk to you.
Really it's nothing. I'm just...
I couldn't be inner. Monica?
Awww, awww, it's beautiful.
Hey Joey, what 'cha doing?
Ohhhh, I cannot look at it!
Why the hell didn't you tell me!
Do you wanna play football?
Because he's stealing from me!
Wow! This place is fabulous!
Huh.. How about 600?
Oh yeah, she can't be herself.
Yeah, these are pretty ch-ching.
She you in the parking lot.
Oh and I'll call ya too!
Oh please, they're having sex.
Okay, I'll see you after the thing.
And um, what-what is that Ross?
How do you know about that story?!
Well, I-I'm startin' too.
Oh, sorry, it's my phone. Hello?
Whoa, how do you know about that?
Oh so-so not really never.
What song was that, Pheebs?
Did-did you take these back?
She-she died Jill.
Oh yeah. That makes sense.
Wel-wel-well what are we gonna do?
We have to get her a present?!
Hey, c'mon, cut it out.
All right. Hey-hey-hey!! Sandwiches!
Ohh, I'm gonna be on the news!
Oh wow! This is so cool.
Ohh-Do you think he will?!
Oh my god. Janice, hi!
God I'm just a horrible person.
I'm sorry. I'm done. I'm done.
Okay, I'm done. Do mine.
Yeah, Phoebe you're... awful!
Ooooh! Wow!! Oh, hi.
Ugh. Wait, wait, wait.
Because I knew you were lying!
You put these on my desk!
Probably just the first half.
All right!! Fine! Fine.
That's the end of this conversation!
Maybe you should put it off.
You give me back my Walkman!
So now what have we agreed?
Aww, look at the little thing.
Oh no, I can't. I got a date.
God, Monica it's on the ceiling.
So, uh, how was your day?
Alright! Enough out of you!
Monica, will-will you marry me?
Well yeah, sure, what's up?
Third one from the left?
You remember when we got these?
Yeah, Monica's settin' me up.
Aw. Hey, Pheebs, want this?
Hey Ross! I brought reinforcements.
OK, then get me your purse.
Oh, Joey, I have such a problem!
Yeah, yeah I like him a lot.
Oh, well okay. Well, there you go.
What is this? Ross, what is this?
You were gonna drink the fat.
You let Joey drive it?!
I think you should drink the fat.
Okay, umm, I'm gonna get my sweater.
Ross, please, I found the magazines!
Yeah, that was a real good one.
I KNOW!! I KNOW!! I KNOW!
Really?! Oh my God! I'm successful!
How did it go with Erin?
Take it like a man, Ross!
What did, what did he say?
Really! That-that great huh?
Oh my God! Oh, I cannot believe it!
But we should move quick.
Well, you were pretty damn good.
Oh my God Monica, who is that?
Oh. Amy! Happy Thanksgiving.
Yeah, 15 hundred dollars.
I, uh, think you already are.
Umm, can I use your bathroom?
Shake that nasty butt...
Joey! I can't believe you just did that!
Really?! You think that will work?
You guys wanna get some coffee?
I've got some bad news.
No-no, I'm staying put.
I just, I feel, I-I just...
Hi. Ohhh, you got my message.
Well why didn't you take the job?
Hi! Oh, I'm so glad you called.
Oh, Phoebe, do I wanna hear this?
Oh really? Like what Monica?
Here comes another contraction.
No so we're protecting her.
We are looking at a Playboy.
Hello! Ohh, kids love me.
Ohh, I mean it's just so realistic!
Eh. Beth dies.
4 o'clock. Food?
So I'm thinking about you. So what?
And... taped back together.
Ross, my father doesn't hate you.
No, I think that was the whole all.
You mean the one that you're wearing?
Whoa-whoa-whoa, let's say more!
Heey man, I work out.
You stole them from me!!
Wait, I-I just said "leave."
You've being seeing someone?
I didn't know you could get married here.
I meant, me plus one!
Let's dry 'em again.
Oh come on, I already went.
But Pheebs, y'know you earned it.
I can't... I can't hear it again.
No. A break from us.
I want the little round waffles.
Hi, hi can I help you?
Ooh, ooh, ooh,ooh,ooh. Hi.
Hi! Wh-what are you doing here?
Oh my God, I gotta go to work!
Oh, wow, Molly is just great!
What is this? What are we doing?
Oh God, I really had a good time!
It's not a baby! It's a cat!
I can't. Please, you do it for me.
Thank you. Okay, twenty dollars.
I thought I was a complete idiot.
Joey, you have got to take this back!
No-no-no, that' not Joshua.
Yeah well, I'm-I'm a slut.
Ohh, I like swimmer's bodies!
Ooh great! Very Monica.
Yes. You're not asking are you?
You are having a party tonight??
Really? You think that's all it is?
Yeah? I'm sorry about your girlfriend.

Monica, where did you get these?!
Why would I have to sleep with you?
No, was he any good in it?
Uhh... I think I just got engaged.
What-what are-what are these?
Oh, gosh, it's hot in here.
Excuse me, there was no time!
Hi Joey, how ya doin'?

Hey Joey, can I ask you something?
Emma! See? I don't want it.
We can't. We're not pharmacists!
Are you breaking up with us?
Oh no. No Ross, don't do this.
Throw in the duck too!
I don't care, I'm not going anywhere.
Oh, God, he's such a pig,
Why aren't you home yet?!
So Pheebs, pick one of them.
What?! What else did he say?
Yeah, it couldn't hurt to look.
You're out of Diet Coke.
You're out of toilet paper!
Well, look at that, same thing.
OK, I'm doin' it for ya.
Oh wow. Are you in trouble.
It's a pretty cool tux.
I'm sorry honey, what were you saying?
Ugh, Monica, I know about you and Chandler.
It'll be a short one.
Okay. Okay, see? I get the phone.
How'd it go with Pete?!
Oh, yeah. Definitely you, Pheebs.
Okay, what? What is too sensitive?
Well, y'know what, that doesn't matter.
She dropped off a casserole?
Uhh, the mailman, the super.
Well, what-what 'cha got there?
Which one do you think she is?
It's worse than the thumb!
Oh... what an interesting name.
AND YOU KNOW!!!

About an hour ago.
Okay. I'm sorry. You're right, you're right.

We love you, we're here for you.
Ohh, of course Monica's brother!
I don't know... sometimes it doesn't.
Would anybody like more coffee?
Wow. She does that a lot!
No, you could've lost your job.
Ross, I am a human doodle!!
Could tonight be the Night?
How is that the silver lining?
Are you okay? You're not blinking.
Yeah well unless we tell him.
Hey, Ross!!! I told you I don't!
No. I was just going to do this myself.
Wow! I can't believe that's our baby.
You-you're not wearing a jacket.
Mon, honey, I gotta ask you something.
Anybody wanna trade? Oh...
Sure we should... So.
No! No-no, I love it. Thank you.
Hey, how'd the interview go?
Oh, did you not want people to know that?
Well, I was gonna let you play with it.
Oh my God! The millionaire's here!
You're a pathetic loser, right?
Well you have to because maybe it's stupid.
Oh my God. Did you talk to him?

Ohh! Thank God! Where was it?
Does anybody want anything else?
Hey, Mon, you want some help?

Well, I-I could live without it.
Okay Monica, did you know about this?!
You are undressing very quickly.
You're just staring into space.
Okay. What?! What are you doing here?!
I know, I know. I went a little crazy.
Not even with your best friend.
What?! No! I'm not gonna move out!
Ok, here, I know what we can do.
Then what's with all the bananas?
Well we're gonna miss you around here.
Oh, I read that in high school.

Well, honey that was pretty obvious.

Oh, you bought me a present! Why?
Hi Joey! What are you doing here?
What? What!?! You kissed him?
No, I don't think we'll be doing that.
Okay, y'know what? Maybe I should go!
You really think it would be that different?
Okay! All right! How was she?
Would you excuse me for a second?
Why? Honey, what is the big deal?
Jurassic Park could happen.
Yeah, honey, they wouldn't miss this.
Now that she broke up with you?
Well, we are ready to try anything.
I've never lived like this before.
Wow. There it is, I see it.
Why aren't you guys at the movie?
All right. I'm a total pro!
Oh... Oh my God. He remembered.
Why-why aren't you more excited?
Well, congratulations, so do you love her?
Could you please get her attention?
Really? But I'm being so unreasonable.
Ross, can you pass me the yams?
No, Phoebs. I'm dating Russ.
Uh Ross? You asked me that.
Ahh... Chandler's on the couch!!
You just did a little dancy thing.
Actually, I just wanna talk to Tag.
I could not have done this without you.
What? Did her ass explode?!
Phoebe hates Pottery Barn?!
We took our apartment back!!
Well, I brought the next best thing.
I'm on the phone! Dr. Wiener?
Oh! Oh my God! What did I just do?
Uh, put your elbow in it.
High-five, the babies are coming!
Pretty uhm, different huh?
And Monica, what are you going to make?
Come on, just answer the question!
Oh well, you don't want to do that now?!
You went shopping for fur?
Oh. Yes! I would so move out!
And all these people actually died?
So umm, what's this book about?
All right, straight, and not subtle.
It depends on who asked.
Time is money my friend?
Okay, no uterus, no opinion.
It was only 500 bucks.
Bye. What a manipulative bitch.
Oh please, you inhale your food!
So did you break up with Joanna?
Really?! So this has happened to you?
Uhh, we still need a tip.
Oh, you're not having fun, are you?
No, I know! I get it! It's funny!
But he has to know how I feel!
Well y'know, I don't want you to be cold.
Well look, if you don't like this...
Oh! Screw it, I didn't get it!
Okay, even this is turning me on!
Noo! Maybe! I, I don't know.
How have you never been on Oprah?
Chandler, can you give us a minute?
Okay! All right, pick a half.
God. You seem really, really nice.
And you are a very funny clown.
Monica! I'm not gonna screw it up!
Oh my...God! Let me see that!
Noo! I wish! Okay, you ready?
And your fly's still open...
Oh my God, he dream-cheated on you!
Well what is it? Let me see.
Fine! I'm sorry for your loss!
Oh my God! My dog died!
Does anybody need more coffee?
But Ross, you want the name Ruth!
But I told you, I didn't have the time!
Okay, y'know maybe I should come back...

Well, yeah! I'm still pursuing that.
All right, so we weren't prepared!
Oh, well, are hey, are you nervous?
No! You gotta hold my hand!!
You all know? Does Ross know?
I'd do anything for you, you know that.
Well don't you have that big date tonight?
Thank you. Hello? I still don't get it.
Any sign of your brother?
Oh, it's perfect! But not for tonight.
Oh, that's very-Really very-very okay.
Great set tonight Phoebs.
Yeah! Remember I got that uh, gala.
I'm so happy and not at all jealous.
Huh. Does Monica know about this?
I hope you're going somewhere with this.
Hey, you.... So, what's up?

Oh, it dispenses clean diapers!
Ohh, thank you for the wonderful dinner.
Well, maybe you didn't want it to end?
Wow, he must like you the best.
OK, I'm guessing this is from...
Oh my god, oh, you guys are great.
That's all right. And so it begins.
Oh. Oh, it's beautiful. I see it now.
Okay! I got the keys! Okay! Okay!
Well, why didn't you just take a cab?

Down at the docks again?
All right are you guys gonna come down?
Oh, no sit-ups today Tag?
Oh gosh, she's going to kill me.
It's over! You have to accept that.
Hi! Tag. What are you doing here?
So it would just be, me alone?
Oh my God! Really?! Can I see it?
I get to hire my own assistant!
Oh, I'm not doing it alone. I have Ross.
Okay, you guys, just relax. I doooo.
Really? It doesn't seem desperate?
Okay, okay, okay should I be scared?
You didn't propose to me. Joey did.
And a crappy New Year.
Oh honey he doesn't need my help.
Was that all you wanted to ask me?
I want to tell you to have a good honeymoon!
So, did you shave your legs?
: We have apple cinnamon...
Well, I'm sorry, I thought you needed them!
Good! I'm glad it's not a problem.
Get out, get out of my apartment.
Nah, uh, uh, uh, uh.
Yeah but, he's not your type.
Ross, it just wouldn't have been feasible.
No! Wait! Wait-wait! Ross, please!
Yeah do it now, call right now.
That's a line from the show too!
You are asking me to be your wife!
Let us keep the apartment and...
Oh God, I know I'm a pathetic loser.
So how's it goin' with Joey?
Time's up, now your dead.
Look at it, isn't it beautiful?
Foot rubs for a month!
I know, I can do more than cook.
Oh my God you stole her award!
Chandler, there's a guy right over there.
Oh, you poor little famous man.
Yeah. Why? Is that weird for you?
So, is this just gonna be you and Carol?
No! If there was I wouldn't tell you.
Wow! I can't, I can't feel my hands.
I don't know! Maybe they have tools.
Come on, they were not that huge.
Yeah honey you don't believe her do you?
Phoebe, honey, wanna get some breakfast?
What? Oh, I'm sorry, I can't, I'm busy.
You didn't break up with that fireman?
Joey has got a secret peephole!
Vrrbddy, the bll is drrbing.
Okay! So, we'll just stay married.
And you really think this is a good idea?
Well, apparently he scares easy.
Yeah. You're not gonna end up alone.
Who ? Joey: Me.
Ross, why do you hate our child?
You would do that? I never get picked!
Hey, who's this little naked guy?
No-no, they're not very nice people.
Hey, what have you guys been up to?
Yeah and there's really cute guys there.
And that makes you angry because...
And stop saying that! I hate that!
Hi Tag! What are you doing here?
How long do cats live?
Honey, you got a little thing on your...
He doesn't speak much English.
Yeah, he's back. Is that a problem?
I don't know! I mean, what brought that on?
How come you didn't come over earlier?
Okay, just give me the damn drops!
What, what's it, what's going on?
Yeah, but, there were no suds.
Oo! When's her birthday?!
Oh, I'm sorry! Do you need the phone?
Well y'know, we did other stuff too.
Hey, Mom? Having fun?
Ok... "Emma just said gleba"!
Oh, it's so much more fun with you.
"Yeah. That works for me."
Yeah, I mean I was up sick all night.
Ohh, thank you, thank you, thank you.
Hey! Oh right, tonight was your party.
Oh! I would love to read a poem.
I knew it! I knew it, ahh....
I was laughing! You made me laugh!
Yeah that's actually a pretty good idea.
How can you not remember us kissing?!
Good day for married people huh?
No, we kinda broke up instead.
Uh, it was very nice meeting you.
I haven't seen him in so long!
Get the hell out of there, y'know?
Nope. We took her to lunch.
Ugh, those bastards! Let's go.
Oh, oh, I love that Japanese place.
Off to see young Ethan?
Honey don't worry, it was my mistake.
Ross, you had sex with another woman!
Great! We will do all of those.
Okay, y'know what? I'll-I'll have toast!
Are-are you saying he's a geek?
Uh, honey, yeah that was with Carol.
Oh, okay. Will you take my place?
Come on, I don't know what else to do.
Wow you, you. I had no idea.
So can we keep this between us?
Hey, Mon, I was just doing the dishes!
Do you guys know any cute guys?
Hey, umm, can I ask you guys something?
Okay, who are you talking to when you do that?
Oh! I do not have chubby ankles!
Honey, Monica, this is ridiculous! Look...
Well maybe he's just taking a nap.

All right, I'm gonna make more margaritas!
Okay mommy, don't ever leave me.
Ooh, good God, they're so yummy!
Oh good God! I've fallen down!
I don't know why they didn't just tell us.
Hi mum, put her back on!
I'm just kidding! You can go pee!
What? Shut up! We're winning!
Oh, God, ask them what they want.
I'll help you throw out your purse.
So, like, you guys all have jobs?
See? Now, he could date her.
How many guesses do you get?
Oh, we're leaving. Bye Kash.
Uh, he took the SAT's for me.
I don't care! This guy is a nightmare!
Take the top down did ya?
Oh, well you know who I love the most?
Look, either help me or go.
Somebody got in late last night.
Here. I thought you might be cold.
Oh, I'm sorry I spoiled you're evening.
Who are you saying "check" too?
Okay, get ready to see some beggin'!
You know, actually it's more like, hi.
Yeah, I mean, you should play in public!
Hey, hi! Hey, where've you been?
I mean he just started going out with her.
You have a play date with a stripper?!
Oh, screw you guys, you don't have to do it!
People are trying to sleep in here!
Oh yeah! I mean, that was pretty intense.
I thought you only met him once?
Yeah, but I'm pretty sure he's gay.
You never come into this office again!
You can't, because of the new skylight!
Yes, we should. I think we should.
Ohh, you've waited soo long.
'Cause I don't need your stupid ship.
Honey I swear it we just kissed.
Okay that is the one we already have!
I know that. That's why I was getting married.
Well...did you know he was gonna ask me?
Your fly is open, Geller.
But, but, Mona, I live here.
That almost hit me in the face.
Wow! Would I have seen you in anything?
Amy! Yes I do.. I really do.
Whoa! Wait! Hello! What about me?
Well, what are you guys doing tomorrow night?
I cannot believe Ross is buying this!
Great! Now he's gonna know it was me!
Oh good. Ahhh! My God, sorry!
Okay, that we may be able to do.
They made you head of the department!
What if she jumped out the bassinet?
Well, I-I should've told you the truth.
Hey, they were popular when I left!
Ross, honey, is there anything we can do?
I just don't know! It just doesn't feel right.
Oh, you are losing. Definitely losing.
Okay. Are you sure you wanna hear this?
Well, there's two spots left right?
Um, there was a Geller Cup?
Isn't that a line from the show?!
Good, Pheebs. What'd you buy?
I'm thinking, I'm gonna order a pizza.
Wow! Spinning that sounds like fun.
Oh, I don't know. I guess we have to eat.
...if you tell me, I might do it.
It's not funny, this is actually my job.
Hey Phoebs, whatcha got there?
Sandy, that's exactly what it is...
Oh, slides. So really nothing happened.
That's weird, she locked the door.
And I also brought my friend Joey...
How about 600 and these earrings?
Uh, actually, I think I'm gonna be busy.
Okay, you want me to stop at the ATM?
Yeah, well that's how mad I am!!
Oh! I have your key. Here you go.
N-no, Emma dropped her sock.
Okay. Just give us a second. Ross!
Just give us our apartment back!
Okay, let's do it. I'll move in.
Hi! Hey, Happy Valentine's Day!
Yeah well what are you, his boyfriend?
I am. Let me just get my coat.
Ah, so what are we looking at?
Oh, terrific! That'll be $2,000.
What are you ever gonna use that for?!
Well, y'know I-I don't know where he is.
Wiener, Wiener Wiener, Wiener!!!
Ohhhhh. That's how it got fixed!
You know, he was just doing his job...
Oh you did, there are twenty in here.
I'd need an expense account.
Well, Phoebe set me up on a date.
Hi, I'm back. Listen, I need to...
Because she hates Pottery Barn.
Why, how much is this gonna cost?
Call her! Call her now!
The ring from the cave, yeah.
Well it stupid, unfair question!
Get your hands out of there! No!
Okay, maybe they are not funny to you...
This is how I would hold a football.
Y'know Bob in Human Resources...
You were really gonna do that, weren't you?
That is the sweetest thing, I just....
Oh, right! Wait a minute, I do that too.
You took the same class twice.
Ah, did I leave the stove on?
All right, then you owe me $350.
No, we didn't get married! That's ridiculous!
Joey, where did you learn that word?
Oh they're pushing! They're pushing!!
What? What's what you were afraid of?
Good, good, good, good, good.
Oh, now see that's a fancy but.
We are so gonna find them this year.
So, um, will you bring the truck?
I'm just sort of in the middle of something.
Well, at least that's a great suit.
Ehhh, no, I wanna do Phoebe's thing.
Honey, maybe we should take you to a doctor.
All right... Oh, Emma loves him!
Wow, so why don't you go talk to him?
Oh! I've got a lot of those too!
Yeah. Who's workin' for you babe?
Phoebe, it's okay. I like living with Joey.
How could you not tell me you worked here?
Y'know, I'm still 29 in Guam.
Oh you went to the movies by yourself?
Sure. I just sharpened her this morning.
Well now it's an empty bar.
Well those are very popular frames.
Yeah! All right, I'll see you guys later.
Are you seein her again tonight?
Hello? Who are we spying on?
Huh. Well, uh, that's uh, that's interesting.
Phoebe just found out about Monica and Chandler.
Oh! So you're driving up to Connecticut?
Uh yes, heroin and crack.
So were you guys together a long time?
Ben, its Rachel! But whatever.
Oh, go on! You telling people about me?
Oh what, you-you want both of them?
Mon, Ethan called again. Mon?
Oh, he brought her back to his apartment.
Don't!! Honey, what are you doing here?!
I'm sorry, Rosita? As in...
You don't want to work for a guy like that.
Joey, Joey I love you so much, but I...
Will you stop calling it your apartment!
So you guys go, have a really good time.
Why on earth would I understand this?
What?! Chandler, what is the matter with you?!
No sorry hon, Monica's orders.
Okay, you'd tell me the truth. Right?
Yeah, that'd be great. I'd love it.
I can't believe it! I got a second interview!
Oh, Monica, c'mon, you do cool things.
Oh yeah! Yeah please, you guys have fun.
Hi, and I am also Emma's mother.
But you did! I mean, let's be honest.
So, will I like any of these guys?
Do you even know who Kip is?
Op! Wait, you dropped a pea.
Kinda hurtin' my hand though.
No, it's all right. I got nice boobs.
No don't! Go back to repeating!
Wow! If only more people knew.
Monica, how come you never told me this?!
Y'know who I always liked? Mork.
Oh, wow. Super ass-kissing power.
Hi! Oh, how was your date last night?
God, you have to tell me what happens tomorrow!
Thank you, thank you, thank you, Pheebs.
Sure! God, please take those off!
Okay guys, way to wish me luck!
You guys are really right...there aren't you?
I know I told you, it's a really big problem.
That is neither here nor there.
Uh, we are here to break up with you.
Oh, here's that trench-coat that you wanted.
What am I making him by the way?
Thanks, you can just put it on the table.
You are so just doing this out of spite.
Y'know, I can not believe you told him, Joey!
Well what?! How-how much is it?!
Please? YES! Sandy you're hired.
So did you read your evaluation yet?
What-what if I marry Ross-Or Joey?
Remind me to introduce you to someone!
What's your favourite thing about summertime?
My gynecologist tried to kill me.
My boss wants to buy my baby!
Hey Joey, how'd the audition go?
Yeah, I can't *wait* to go back to work.
You promised you would break up with her!
Do you even know what a vicar is?
He's perfect, he's never been better.
Now Joey, what did the duck do?!
Make love? What are you a girl?
Oh, God, oh, God, I mean it's just so.
Me, Fledermaus, great. I really-
That really is something; that's really cool.
No! Seriously! What's wrong with you?!
Hey! Umm, do you guys have any juice?
Oh! That would be sooo much fun!
Oh, god, I know it, that I freaked you out.
Grammy, Best New Artist.
Excuse me? Can I help you with anything?
Cat! What'm I saying? Cat!
It happened! I am telling you it happened!
To get you to make out with him!!!
Oh! Look! I have a sonogram picture!
No way. No way did you do this.
W-What are you, what are you talking about?
Well, you know, no suds, no save.
Oh wait Chandler, too many cooks...
Come on, Joey, I did it and it was fine.
This one is uh Paul O'Neil.
What?! My mom's not gonna be here?!
But wait you said everything was gonna be okay.
Okay, calm down, here they are.
: Sak's... Fifth... Avenue.
Ish. I just don't think I can bear it.
Phoebe, I thought your dad was in prison.
Hey Phoebe, can I talk to you for a second?
Okay, gotta go! Wish me luck!
Hi Danny! Wow! Thirsty huh?
No-no-no! No, no, no, we're not married.
Wo-women? You mean like old women?
I haven't seen you in like.. a year.
Manhattan does not have enough stores.
Oh, oh, this is good, this is really good.
I'm just visiting my good friend Carol.
Oh we just put her down for a nap.
Yeah, I think she wants the old one back.
Oh, y-yeah, so, you-you love me!
Did I miss it? Did I miss it?
Seriously, your dad doesn't like pranks.
Oh, just tell us! We're not gonna want it!
You're all gonna be aunts and uncles.
Chandler gets it! It's Chandler Bing!
Oh no, at the Grammies I always win.
Oh my God! You got her to stop crying!
How-how did you lose your job here?
Oh!! My God, what are you doing here?
You need to learn some new slang.
Huh, well maybe it uh, it changed.
Open it! Open it! Open it!
Yeah and I'm a horrible, horrible person.
Please, no, go, that'd be fine!
Yeah, we got him back. Everything's fine.
The meeting with the guy went great?
Well! Good night. I'm going upstairs.
Go get back on that case honey!
Y'know, it is not like I did this on purpose.
Chandler, relax, Chandler, she'll be here.
Hey, Pheebs, quick question for ya.
Well I-That's never gonna happen with Ross.
Y'know what? Let's, let's talk later.
You're gonna be late! Go! Go!
Oh God... Oh, he's in there right now?
Oh no, Baby Girl Geller-Green.
Ohh, so no sign of Emily huh?
Then, you will definitely get him back!
Ross said my name. Okay? My name.
Oh God, even his knock is boring.
I was just going to say that I left my keys.
What...that scene I saw was so good!
Yes! Thank you! Exactly! You want it?
Well then why did you give me a ring?
Not gonna find any clothes in there!
Hang in there. You hang in there.
There isn't. There is totally isn't.
Monica. You've, you've done it right?
And now you're watching me walk away.
No! Don't say that! Don't say that!
Some uh, some visual aides.
Joey. Honey what would I do without you?
They had to have that specially made?!
Oh, him, the little guy? Oh, I love him!
Ok, I will have the uh, side salad.
Why are- why are you so tanned?
Can I please be there when you tell her?
I don't know, what were the names I just said?
Oh, if she jumps, I get her tickets.
Oh-oh, that's a risky little game!
No, not that, I mean, what about you and Mindy?
You went out with a guy in the Navy?
Oh screw her, that part is mine!
Oh God twenty seconds my ass!!
No, I meant with the dropper over here.
Oh no! My new Paolo shoes!
Oo, toes!! Well, for some people.
Hey-hey! Oh, look at you, all sexy.
Oh, this lipstick looks just great on you.
Oh... ... Oh my God. He remembered.
Um, what- what would make you think that?
I got-I get a big pay raise!
Huh-hoo, yeah, no, it's still basil.
Yeah, and I am okay with being a pushover.
No, it wasn't. It was actually the...
Not for me. Chip and I broke up!
Uh-huh... why... do you not like them?
Oh, I went to have pizza. With Danny.
Oh my god, I left the water running.
Why, when did you get out of the game?
I don't have any issues with my Father.
How is you drinking helping the kids?
Hi! I just wanna--Ahhh!!! Oh my God! Oh my God!
I guess I can talk to one of my supervisors...
So Pheebs, what do you want for your birthday?
I don't know. Maybe I'll know when I see him.
Oh, you know what? Rachel.. She just left.
So, whaddya think George is like?
Well, what happened to your jam plan?
Me? Oh, no, I am not an actress.
Well and clearly not a minute sooner.
I'm not here! That's just my Chinese food!
Sorry I'm late, but I left late.
I can't. I'm busy. I'm apartment hunting.
No, I will. I'm just not up for it tonight.
No, you have it, really, I don't want it-
Okay, Ross, I'm really trying to tell you something here.
I don't know. Do I have to decide right now?
Yes! But what is wrong with this dog?!
Okay. Okay. Joey, it's okay. Settle down.
Joey, come on! We just went over this!
Oh! Well, um.. You've got plugs!
Oh no-no-no, no-no-no, that's not what I meant.
Okay, I'm just gonna write this out to cash.
Hey Mon? I'm gonna check my messages.
Well of course that is what I'm here for!
What are you doing?! Get in the front!
Wow! Whoa-whoa what's under the covers?
Aw what are you?! A detective?
What do you mean you quit?! You can't quit!
What, because that's your answer to everything?
Hey! That's just poking me in the eye!
I'm doin' good, baby. How you doin'?
Cute guys in little shorts? Sure.
You. Like you haven't done enough.
Oh, I don't think she likes the new Hugsy.
I know, I know, so it is just not a big deal.
Oh my God, they let you keep that stuff?!
Oh, oh, that's what you're talking about. Hey.
Yeah, I'm doing okay. I'm um...let's talk.
At his apartment. Is this juice?
Oh no, not in my room! I'll get him.
I-I-I-I'm just...I'm just a good kisser!
I can't. I can't push anymore, I can't.
Have you ever seen so much crap?
Hey, Mr Philips, nice suit!
Remember that big thing I was gonna tell you about?
Alright. So where'd you grow up?
And you're no friend to those with noses.
Yeah. Umm, unless you wanna come inside?
Ohh! It's so nice to meet you. Hello.
Why does it matter so much to you?!
Oh my God, Phoebe, are you gonna go to jail?!
Nobody, forget it! Rachel: Maybe.
Oh shoot! I work Monday nights.
What?! Why? Joey you were so ready for it!
Ohhhhhh, look it's the roller blades.
And a nice hot cider for Monica.
Ahhhhh, salmon skin roll.
Ewww, ewww, ewww, ewww!
I don't think he's the one who needs help.
Maybe that's all we do, what about Julie?
Well, what's the other thing, what do I think?
No-no-no! This chair's not going anywhere.
Hey, don't listen to them. I think it's sexy.
Oh honey, I'm so proud of you, Min.
Okay, you gotta give me some of your piece.
Damn! I wish I knew if that was right!
Why, does she have a bad personality?
Chandler! You're smoking? What are you doing?!
When Carol was pregnant with Ben...
Can I see you in my office for a minute?
Well then he gets a divorce, it's Ross!
Yeah, I did. I needed my lucky dress.
Phoebe, no! This is, this is insane.
Um-hmm. There we go. There it is.
But I-But everything is okay. I'm fine!
Ohh, wait a minute, we haven't pre...
Come on see, she doesn't look that bad.
What? Oh my God! I'm gonna miss you so much!
Wow, I really get crabby when I cook.
Pheebs, I don't think anyone's mad about that.
Honey, what are you doing? That's too heavy.
Well, well, well, look what mommy found!!
Alright, Monica, I want you to have the first taste.
Oh but look! That's gonna leave a stain!
Okay Ross, can I uh, can I ask you something?
I don't know. Y'know, they didn't get us anything.
Rome. Jerk missed his flight.
Already? That's pretty bad what you did.
Whatever Linus, I'm opening mine.
What? You just click when they click.
Well, Phoebe that's fine because I'm not moving.
Oh, it's just... Oh, Barry, this was not good.
Oh, look at the little cat! Look at it!
And um, excuse me, he helps me.
Ooh, I just feel bad, I never vacuum.
I think you should definitely go out with this guy.
Oh wow, you are really, you're really a creep.
Oh... that's too bad. Bye bye.
Wow! Mon, thanks! I love this plate!
Pheebs, could you maybe hand me a cracker?
I tried! They won't take her back.
Okay. Hang up! That's it! Come on!
Yeah, come on! What's going in on in there?
But honey, I think she's moving in with Chandler.
I'm so dead serious. I'm totally serious.
You don't pick me! You're stuck with me!
Monica, you broke up with him for a reason.
That's right! You do what the hand says!
Hey, wait a minute! That is my sock!
Oh, wait Ross! I'm sorry, one more thing!
Well just ask Mona to give it back!
Open your drapes! Open your drapes!
Wait a minute! What are you gonna tell Joanna?
Oh! I remember laughing! I laughed a lot.
Why? You saw it? Is it scary?
Hey. Gosh, you look soo familiar.
Okay. Umm, what should we do for the theme?
I don't know. Who would I have to sleep with?
You gave her a key to your apartment?!
Maybe, but shouldn't we wait for Chandler?
What, it's ok when Chandler does it?
Oh, it's just like a bloodbath in here today.
'Kay. Congratulations on your new job.
I a not gonna lie to you, I'm pretty sick.
Oh, I can't. Because I-I've seen them.
Did he call? Did Mark call?
Hey, how's...how's the uh, miracle chair?
Ugh, how can you even ask that question?!
If we broke up, and I lost you...
Well, because she loves you and because you love her.
Oh yeah, they're really great! Aren't they?
Guess who we ran into today?!
So umm, what time are you supposed to leave?
Okay, let me just get a cup of coffee.
I'm gonna go get one of those job things.
OK, OK. I'm with you, Cheech. OK.
Okay, y'know what? We don't need her measurements.
Yes, the hard part is truly over.
Wiper blades. I don't even have a car.
Okay. Uh, want something-want something to drink?
Umm, I think he's still out. What's wrong?
Oh, she's coming up! She's coming up!
Oh! Tommy, this is Ross. Ross, Tommy.
Hey, do you guys have any extra ribbon?
I... Well, I don't think they need any help.
No! It's just that, Kate bothered me.
Uh-huh. Y'know what I was, I was thinking about?
Joey I don't think you know what behalf means.
Ross, I didn't think it would that big of a deal.
Aren't you a little cute to be a doctor?
Oh-oh-oh, which one is Bonnie again?
Hey! Y'know what? Let's talk about relationships!
Let me, let me get you some wine!
So do you think that my dream means anything?
If I said I was, would you judge me?
That yeti is one smooth talker.
Oh, really, let me see, let me see.
When did you go to a sperm bank?
Oh, Phoebe, that really cute guy is here again.
I got to figure out what I'm going to wear.
Come feel this! Come feel my belly!
You wanna go inside and have some coffee?
Not unless different means the same.
And you just get to be cool Aunt Phoebe!
Alright, c'mon! Let's play Twister!
So are things with you and Joey any better?
Three people. Joshua's not gonna be there.
Hi. Look um, about what happened earlier...
I'm-I'm-I had no idea. I'm sorry. I...
I-I, got a job at Ralph Lauren.
Ohh, you guys are so made for each other.
No, everything's fine. I just gotta go back...
I mean, y'know I'm just gonna have to accept it ...
Oh I don't know honey. It's gonna be really late.
Uh, Pheebs? Who's George Snuffalopagus?
I know, me neither! I mean, you had a sketch!
Chandler Bing? It's time to see your thing.
What? Wait! Why...why do you get the story?
Is this a little too... Pheebs, what happened?
Are you comparing my daughter to a rat?
Monica, I don't want to lose 200 dollars.
Look at that guy by the window, wow!
I'm not asking you to go on a date with him!
Don't look at me I never get his jokes.
Yeah, it is amazing it lasted that long.
All right, wherever you wanna go is cool.
Ehhh, aw! . Well, that's new!
I thought I was making him filet mignon?
Whoa, look at you, you did pretty well.
Agh, it was the graduation from hell.
Monica! Look! Hi! What do ya think?
Oh-oh, sorry, it's this way, it's this way.
I know! My God! Do you have your speech?
Well, maybe that's, maybe that's really brave.
Ehhhummmm, I don't know, why don't you taste it.
You were with Kenny today, weren't you?
Oh my God, look there's Roy Gublik.
Oh my God! Did you get to see anything good?
Um, seven...e-e-eight, eight years. Wow.
Oh yeah? Did he pull the old...
Oh God. It seems like forever ago.
Ok, let's not make a big thing about this!
Tell her to wear her own earrings.
I can't watch. It's like firing Elmo.
He's coming over! He's coming over!
Ohh! You did not drop any socks!
Well, why doesn't he practice with a girl?
Yeah, why is it so hard for you to believe?!
Yep! Happy and healthy! And cute!
Richard? I'm not gonna go see your ex-boyfriend!
Ooo! Oh, I forgot they made sheets!
Chandler!! Promise me, you will end it.
Oh my God! You really are freakishly strong!
Luisa? Oh my God! Monica! It's Luisa!
Oh, it's so late for 'Shall we'...
Hi! Is my misery amusing to you?
Ok, we never shoulda talked about this.
Phoebe, don't you think you've had enough to drink?
Oh you really, you really just don't want to hear about it.
Yeah, I know. It's ridiculous! I can't see you either.
I'm not moving! Is that picture straight?
God how long do you think that's gonna last?
Oh, I found him. He was Paolo's cat.
Ok, you know what, I'm just gonna take her outside.
Okay. Okay. Okay. Joey, I have got to tell you something!
Boy, are you gonna be sorry if that's true.
Well, then I lost it. You buy me one!
Wow! You certainly think a lot of yourself.
And that's I'm so glad... there's no problem.
No not that. I kissed Gavin last night.
Really? Who would, who would you marry?
Okay, you're right. You're right. You can't help me.
Well, isnt, isnt that gonna be weird?
How many ways are there to do that?
I was gonna give you a chance to apologise to me.
You have been maid of honor before?!!
Phoebe, Shania Twain is still alive!
Wait a minute! Why don't you guys do something?!
Do you want to put the book in the freezer?
Okay so listen I'm gonna go lay down.
Phoebe!! Phoebe!! It's okay!! It's okay!!
Phoebe, you had a date three days ago.
Well you could've untied it with your hands.
Um... unless, unless I use yours.
It was really fun being married to you tonight.
See your twenty-five...and...uh, Monica, get my purse.
Oh, come on, would you just grab my ass.
Alright, alright, so I'm not a great typist...
Gotta go! Hi! Wow! There you go!
Yeah! But I don't know what he looks like!
Hi! Are you ready? We're gonna be late!
Yeah well, you know what, so is uh, Sorentino's.
Yeah, Why? You don't think a woman can do this?
You can keep those pants by the way.
Am I going to let you watch me undress?
My due date is in one week!
Allright. Well thank you so much for coming...
Yeah, well, you uh, better make it for three.
Oh my god, this is the worst date ever!
Stop it! Marcel! Bad monkey!
Phoebe is gonna be Monica's maid of honor!
Ross, we actually watched the documentary together.
Oh Pheebs, is that a new ankle bracelet?
Ok, so uh, who wants the last hamburger?
Thank you. What? You don't want to see this do you?
Wha... are you kidding? I can't return this.
I can't believe it! He still hasn't called.
No, it's not better. I still don't get to see you.
Nooo, he's leaving for a better job.
Pheebes, this woman is voluntarily bald.
Oh, y'know what? That was a complete misunderstanding!
Oooh, honey, you're not a total loser.
The thing is y'know, that you're married to Emily.
What?!! Stop it! Stop it! Oh my God!
Okay, just a little scared. What's going on Ross?
You are the official baby crier stopper!
Well, then I get to give him the cell phone.
I think she's checking out your beehive Ross.
No-no they do but, you just have to wait.
So honey, what are you gonna do about the little girl?
Oh now daddy, stay calm. Please.
EHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!! My God!!!!!!!!!!! Oh my God!!!!!!!
No, Monica! Monica! We have to fix this!
Oh you know what, you sound just like his wife!
Ohh, so do you! Did you lose weight?
But I haven't used my card in weeks!
Ross, she's gonna start getting ready soon!
Well, maybe-maybe I could be your roommate Pheebs.
Oh, y'know what, I didn't want cinnamon on this.
Oh I'm sorry, we're clo-... Hey sailor.
Well, I kind of... I kind of lost him.
Oh my God! We have to throw her a shower?!
Wrong! How do you get the mainsail up?
C'mon, he's right. Tit for tat.
A cyborg?! Isn't that like a robot?!
Umm, Joanna? I wanna talk about that interview.
Oh, she's so tiny. Where'd she go?
Yeah, Stevie's an old family friend.

Ross said there's still no word from Chandler.
They're in Vermont!! How could this happen?!
All right, come on, let's go get your coat.
You're right, I don't have to apologize. Sorry. Damnit!
Has anybody seen my engagement ring?
Hey, so did everything go okay with the annulment?

Okay. Well, I gotta go you guys. I'll see you later.
Wow, I am so glad I'm not Monica right now.
Oh no-no-no! No, I got this all under control.
That's right. You're very cheeky for a temp.
No, it's been three nights in a row.
Chandler, you stole this cheesecake. That is wrong.
No, no, no, you said, "got the keys".
See, I don't know, for me it would have to Chantal.

Everything you need to know is in that first kiss.
Yeah. Ahh, here's a box of your stuff.
Okay, now make it even, 'cause we don't...
I hope it's still funny when you're in hell.
No no no, wait, I wanna see what happens.
Joey, honey, I don't think you're supposed to go back there.
Oh but Phoebe, we're gonna be late for the movie.
Ohh! No way Phoebe! I want to be Monica's!
Ed Begley Jr. is not gay.
All right, we've got to tell her he's gone.
Oh, honey! Don't get up! What do you need?
Hey, umm, do you guys have that tape measure?
Oh my God! Oh my God, look at these pelts!
You have no respect for anybody's privacy!
You really, really need to get some sleep, honey.
Yeah, I didn't want you to get hit by the boom!
And I-I am just trying to figure out why.
Huh, yeah I guess we are roommates now.
Monica, can Phoebe borrow your green dress?
Well, are we all together? Like in a group?
Yeah sure, iced tea would be great.
Really? Wow, this is so much better than I...
Hey! What happened to you? Why didn't you come up?
Well that works out good, because I'm not listening.
Why, why, what's wrong with these guys?
Oh Joey honey I don't...I don't want to lose...
Okaaay. Any of you guys want anything else?
Joey, why wouldn't you invite us to your parties?
Yeah, and Lennart Haze is starring in it.
Ok. Wha...? where? Where are you going?
Hey, it's not that big a deal, I was just curious.
Oh honey, I'm so sorry, you were right, this feels great!
I'm not crazy, right? I mean, it was never like that.
HEY!! Do you have to do that? It's Saturday!
Yeah, and-and-and by someone, she means Joey.
What's that? What? I saw my name. What is it?
From you. I exchanged the blouse you got me.
You ah, you didn't say 'Yes' to that did you?
Oh wait, I have the ten of spades! Here!
I'm- uh- I'm okay... You look great!
Well... well, what did you do to make her laugh?
What? You guys, come on! What am I going to do?
Well it's mine too! What else you got?!
Joey is says Best Supporting Actress!
Ross, get over it! It's not like she hates you.
Yeah, so let's get started on the wedding plans!
Chandler, would you just tell her what she did was wrong?
Oh! Ok. Ok, you really wanna know who it is?
I'm so sorry, you guys. I didn't mean to bring you down.
Oh thank you! Oh God! Can I have another one?
See? I've even called Animal Control!
Relax! It's not like it's Citizen Kane!
You guys are unbelievable. No! He cannot come.
Uh yeah, actually I kinda need to talk to you too.
Oh no. You went on our honeymoon alone?
Oh my God! How long has she been crying?
We ended up having sex in his chair.
Uhhh, yeah. But it's not obvious why.
Oh Ross, honey you gotta stop torturing yourself!
Well, can I keep the presents and still be 29?
Not Joey, no, I was just lusting after Chandler.
Y'know, you should never be allowed to talk to people!
Oh, well, that's - that's very sweet. Thank you.
Aside from the fact that you said you had them?
Heeeeey, where have you been? What happened to you?
Joey, what-what are you doing going into my bedroom?!
What-wh-what so we'll just stay married forever?!
Are you serious-Really?! It's in such good condition.
Oh nothing I... Sorry, I just can't stop crying.
Oh we just-we drove each other crazy!
So uh, what are you guys doing for dinner tonight?
Hey Pheebs, you're still alive! How are you doing?
Oh my God! Oh, that's funny, I can't believe I did that.
Mindy?! My maid of honour, Mindy?!
But can it... just... happen a little bit?
Phoebe, that is juice, squeezed from a person.
Can you please, please take care of it for me?
Well would you like me to lie down on the table?
...I think that bitch cracked my tooth.
Hey, so did everything go all right with the annulment?
Okay, okay, could we change the subject, please?
Ohh, I love Joey! Joey lives with a duck!
What's this? Is this Ross's wedding invitation?
Excuse me? Oh yeah? Well, up yours too!
Ewww. Yeah. Umm. I think I'm gonna stay here.
And here we have the last of Paulo's grappa.
During a blackout? He'd get trampled!
But y'know, I could use a hand getting ready.
What's-what's going on? Phil's really pissed!
I wasn't supposed to put beef in the trifle!
Would you stop?! What is the matter with you?!
Ooh, do I sense a little bit of resentment?
Oh, Sophie, I guess you didn't hear about Joanna...
Hello?! I still don't know what the hell I'm doing!
Okay, but Ross, eventually you and I are gonna be dating.
Oh no. No-no! I think my water just broke.
Come on. Oh! And, uh, by the way....
What-what?! You're gonna leave this person with me?!
Oh, thank you so much for coming. Ross, get in here!
No, I think it's very obvious who's wrong here.
But your divorce isn't even final yet.
Only 'cause you took up half the circle.
Yeah! I am soo gonna marry that guy. Ohhh!
Can you believe what a jerk Ross was being?
Oh I see, so this suit is making a point.
Oh, Ross, I'm sorry. I completely ruined your evening.
Yeah. Uh-huh, I guess it is pretty big news.
All right, you guys, I kinda gotta clean up now.
I made the mistake of telling him that I was pregnant.
I don't wanna hear "Three failed marriages!"
Ummm, I think it's time to see the ring again.
Shh-shh-shh! The guys don't know yet do they?
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's just...It's just so sad!
Joey, God, your apartment is like a hundred degrees!
Joey! Kinda in the middle of a story here!
Ross, would you just stop it! It's getting really old.
Now, what exactly is in a cobb salad?
Whoa! Hey-hey, you planning on inviting us?
Well, what is a boss for? Hug it out!
Monica...would you please tell Joey that he is a pig?
Ross couldn't fit down the trash chute.
Oh, yeah, well hey, welcome to our sauna.
Okay-okay that-that's amazing. How did you know that?
Oh, I blew it. I wouldn't of even hired me.
Oops! All right, so what do you want to do now?
The most unbelievable thing happened to me today.
What?! What?! My birthday's not for another month!
These are from Halloween three years ago.
Yes! That I know, this is from White Plains.
What? What is so strange about me having a date?
Ohh, my new assistant is working out, yes.
I just purchased the La-Z-Boy E-cliner 3000.
Oh, so you just sort of happened to leave it in here?
Well, he gets the other one all riled up.
Well, I'm sorry I'm not going to an eye doctor!
No-no-don't! Don't leave me here with these people.
Okay come on Phoebe, it's nothing! Monica, come on!
You're not the man who left the cell phone.
Oh excuse me! Am I ruining my life?
Uh no, he's not. Can I take a message?
Remember when we were in high school together?
Yeah! I'm gonna have a boyfriend, you're gonna have a girlfriend...
Oh well yeah me too. Um.. I had a baby.
You're right, you're right. I should just tell her the truth.
Oh! Whoops! I'm sorry, you were talking about Emily!
Actually, y'know that's not the Thanksgiving I was talking about.
Yes. Yes, he says I'm damaged goods.
Yeah, well it was. I, I broke a cup.
Here he is. Hi. Guys, this is Russ.
Woah, woah, woah, what book is this?
Yeah, not girls anyway, guys agree like that.
Oh, 'scuse me. I was kinda using that machine.
Wait, what do you mean you're getting a new brain?
Come on! You guys can pee standing up.
Why? Do you have the answers written on there?
I've got magic beans. Never-never mind.
Well, I'm also sending out.... good thoughts.
Where's Chip, why isn't he here yet?
Nice seizing. . . gel boy.
Yeah, I told you to give Emily whatever she wants.
So my mother is not coming to my baby shower?!
So, which of this kitchen stuff is mine?
I cannot, I cannot believe that I invited you here today.
Why? Why not?! People love to hear that!
Timmy was my boyfriend and you made out with him!
Okidoki! Wow! We're never gonna find a nanny.
Yes, but still. They're people...with eyes.
Okay, but before you go, could you help me first?
Hi. Can Emma and I live here for a while?
Ross, what's the big deal? So I kissed the guy!
Oh my God, they told us that was for the mascot!
I know isn't it? It's like I'm right there with Joshua.
Wh-Hey, I just gave you peeing on a stick.
Okay. Oh wait, wait-wait, you're not gonna come with me?
Hi officer, was I going a little too fast?
Cool... "Urkel" in Spanish is "Urkel."
Oh my God! You are giving this a lot of thought.
Even when we were having sex in that chair?
Well, that-that's not your choice. Happy Halloween!
"Baddest man in the whole damn town."
No. What do you do if I say we are coming about?
No! Sorry, I just thought you were somebody else. Hi!
Wait-wait where are you going? Where are you going?
Yeah that seems fair. We never use them.
Because, I can't! Ross, I told you, no. I can't.
Okay, I thought it was about your neighbors liking you.
Oh, please tell me it's not because I'm going with Mark.
No. But don't worry, I'm sure they're still there.
That's it? Well I saw that! Ohh-ohh-oh, thank you.
No. And then I called him, and he wasn't there.
Be-because the last one was such a big seller?
Oh my God! That's so great! I'm so happy for you guys!
Oh, yeah, check it. Definitely, I want some of that.
Yeah, right. Look at you, you're practically giddy.
Now the filet mignon, what comes with that?
You said that she was, I just didn't disagree with you.
Oh, no, meh-nah-nah-nah, come on you're gonna ruin it!
No, she was just much better at job than me!
Oh Ross, would you stop, you got me, I'm dating you.
Oh well, y'know, the gala had to end sometime.
Whoa! I can't believe you did that. That was really sweet.
With my sister Jill and my ex-boyfriend Ross?
Hi! I just want to apologize. I'm really sorry I was a baby.
Maybe she hasn't really thought it through that well.
Oh, honey, don't worry. She's gonna make it on time.
Do you still have that, um, Navy uniform?
I'll be watching TV if anybody needs me.
And I will make everyone call me Mrs. Geller!
I'm just kidding too. I'm getting married in December.
Alright you guys, I'm takin' off my shirt.
Yeah, no, I don't-I don't put things in my eye.
Well, maybe they can find a way to bring you back.
Dealer takes two. What do you bet?
Hey Ross! Any word on the apartment yet?
Hey! You remembered to put clothes on this morning.
This is Bonnie? This is Bonnie? You're Bonnie?
Yeah. No. And you know what? Nobody even saw!
Hi, I thought you might like some ice chips.
I swear, I never wanted any part of your night!
Yes, of course there is! Okay? I'm not insane!
Well, okay. Would-would you get me a Diet Coke?
Oh, y'know, would you just for once, not remember every...little...thing!!
Because I think I just heard her moving around in there.
All gone! So, farm birds, huh?
Ooh, you guys, it starts in like 20 minutes.
I don't know, I just kinda ran into him last night.
Wow! Wow. Wow. Wow, it is hot in here.
Ohh! Right! Right, sorry, I'll be right back!
Did you not get a good enough look the other day?
All right, so are we not having dinner at all?
All right, that's it, you guys! What happened out there?
Ohh, Lilies. Joey, they're my favorite. Thank you.
Nice! One and a half carat easy.
Ross! Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me....
All right! Well, uh... we're gonna hit the beach?
Thank you. Well, I guess we have some time to kill.
Dark, big hair, with the airplane earrings.
Okay, it's missing something. Ooh, I know! Umm, okay.
I can't talk to you. I can't even look at you right now!
Hmm...maybe it starts with how she gets pregnant.
Hi. Sorry, things aren't working out so well.
Right, yeah, I've heard that about cute doctors.
Well, that would've been very hard to say no too.
Uh, well, I think, I think he broke up with me.
Oh Phoebe, we forgot that party we have to go to.
What? Wait-wait a minute, what? Phoebe, what's the matter?
Op, op, car! Car!! Ugh!!!
Well, you're not sixteen, you're both adults now.
Ummm. Oh! I'm sorry. It's a little old but...
That was her idea, I just gave her a nudge.
O-o-o-okay, how did it go? Tell me everything.
Well, I'll ask him for you, if you want me too?
There is a hardware store right down the street?
Ohh. So you raised her all on your own?
yeah I didn't disguise that very well did i.
That refrigerators don't live as long as people.
Oh, Monica! Would you stop being such a wuss?
So just bring it back downstairs, what's the problem?
Uh Pheebs, we just actually kinda wanted to be alone.
Yeah, actually Daddy Ross is allergic to lobster.
Yeah! And until now, I didn't think I'd love again.
Yeah... I, uhh... I have a... I have a date.
Yeah, what, so? You had feelings for me first.
Oh honey, thank you, but Mark's taking me out.
I don't know. Whatever I was feeling, I'm... not.
So now, what exactly is the point of the box?
And... that's the most sex I'm gonna have this weekend.
Okay. Head Ross! Head Ross! Head Ross!
Hey Pheebs, can I talk to you over here for a second?
Whoa, I'm sorry. Excuse me. We had this cart.
So, does this come in another color or...
Ugh, I knew it! Oh I cannot believe those two!
Have you ever had any weird romantic dreams?
Oh, thanks. So, uh, what are you gonna do this summer?
Ohh, well I'm not totally back yet, but thank you.
So Chandler, have you heard about Monica's secret boyfriend?
Yeah but, I've never asked a guy out before.
Wow! This is so amazing! What else? What else?
Wow. I, I don't even know what to say. Thank you.
Chandler? It's Alan, he wants to speak to you.
Hi, I'm Rachel Green. What can I do for you Joshua?
Really nice to meet you... and we'll call you.
Oh Pheebs that's so sweet--Ooh, those are so cute!
Wait a minute. Chandler has a jewelry box?
Or ya know, he's rubber and you're glue.
NO! Or, cut!You know, that's your call!
Cecilia Monroe man, what a great actress.
And uh, he will have a white wine spritzer.
Oh, in my head he's done some pretty "not-gay-stuff"!
That was amazing. I can't even send back soup.
Ross you're not listening to me, I don't have time to stop.
Okay. Seriously, breathe louder Ross! That's great!
I'm sorry Pheebs, I guess I'm just really said that I'm leaving.
Umm, well let's see Monica and Chandler are occupied.
Yes, I did. Thank you very much, it was excellent.
Oh, come on Ross! I think it would be really good for you!
What-yeah-what, y'know what? I hope Emily is a lesbian.
Well, however great she was I just can't afford that.
Well, so, are-are you sure that there are three?!
Ok, Ross, Ross, ok listen, what we have is amazing.
So umm, how-how are we gonna mess with them?
He's so cute! And he seems to like you so much.
Okay, a couple months late on the lecture, Ross.
Is Monica around? I-I have to ask her something.
Oh, could somebody give me a hand with this zipper?
Ahh, yes, I will have a glass of the Merlot
Well mainly because he's kissing that other guy.
So uh, Ryan, were you shipping off to?
Well, get 'em out of here! What's wrong with you?
Oh, but look how straight those noodles are!
I-I-I didn't! I didn't! She thought you were cute.
Now wait a minute. You just took all the words!
I-I-I of course, I have more responsibilities than that.
Ross? All this time? Well, I've got to talk to him.
Want a wedding dress? Hardly used.
Yeah. Just to be sure I'm gonna call Dr. Wiener.
Oh that's so great, now Emma has two Hugsy's.
Oh, wow thanks! Oh you're in real estate!
I use my breasts to get other people's attention.
All right! Who's are they? Who's are they?
Or I'll give them to my new boyfriend, Joshua.
Oh that couldn't have been pretty. but you know guys do that.
Oh, it's the best! So, umm how's Monica?
So what do you say? Can I be your girlfriend again?
Oh-oh!! One hand on the sheet Joe!
Wait, I'm not just gonna drink somebody's old coffee.
Yeah, Joey kinda disabled it when I moved in.
Oh, that's OK, it's just the shoulder, it's not my dress.
Well, I've brought some books. We could read.
Well, I was gonna, but I accidentally read something else.
Here it is! I love it. I wear it all the time.
Yeah, well, feminism yes, but also the robots.
Oh, Barry..! Come on, this is all way too..
Oh, well maybe there was a dog lookin' at him.
I know! I know, it's such a huge, life-altering thing.
Phoebe we just saw mine, let me see yours.
Ross, you stay here and talk, I'm gonna go have a baby.
Yeah, he did! Oh, see, this is what I'm talking about!
Oh well, too late, sorry, you already had some.
Ya know, Dr. Burke kissed me once.
Then what's that big lump under your covers?
Yes, you did! And don't you say, "No, I didn't!"
Hey Chandler. Monica just broke my seashell lamp.
Yeah, love. It's a tricky business isn't it?
This is Joey, and Phoebe, and this is Chandler, and you remember Ross.
Tag is not the father! And Joey knows now?
OK... see your two... and I raise you twenty.
Yeah, and and, I'm just gonna pay for this with a check.
Well, that doesn't sound like a very merry Christmas.
Momma's Little Bakery, Chicago, Illinois.

I can't believe they've been together for three years.
A card! A card! I pick a card!
Okay, y'know what? There is no more left, left!
Oh yeah! I've come up with a bunch of ideas!
I am so psyched I kept this chair for myself!
You do know that I will be here when he comes over.
All right, I'll-I'll take it again when I get home.
..You're, you're 'mah mah mah' what?
That is it! You just barge in here, you don't knock
Hi. Listen, I was um, thinkin' about. . .
Isn't it incredible?! Monica and Chandler, gettin' married.
I'm sorry, I just can't go to the hospital lookin' like this.
No! Really, no, please, please, that's, that's okay.
Well what if I told you, you can do it in my apartment?
So hot I cried myself to sleep last night.
No! There is.. there is noone else!
Any chance you think the couch looks good there?
Okay Ross come on let's just forget about the condoms.
I still don't get how you know when it's false labour.
Oh my God! You're a 30 year old virgin!
Did they mention that I'm rubber and you're glue?
Ooh, Julie's so smart, Julie's so special.
Hey, thanks Ross, for taking care of all of this.
I do need you! I need you to stand near my head!
I know. Ross still sees his pediatrician!!! I don't care!
Shut up that was my friend Melissa from college.
You're right, I'm sorry. Thank you. Okay, that's what I'm gonna do.
Now, that-that was a good thing that I told you, right?
All right, who's turn is it to help me get up!
Oh, how does he look? How does he look?
Huh, that's funny. You look like you're gonna be the...
What? What secrets? You know secrets? What are they?
Oh my God! Why is he jumping on those women!
Ok. Look uhh, Mon I'm, I'm really sorry.
Look, I'm fine. Watch. Look at that. Whoa-whoa!
Ross, didn't you say that there was an elevator in here?
I don't know, it was you and a bunch of albino kids.
Y'know Joey, I could teach you to sail if you want.
Okay, you are going to tell her and you're going to tell her now.
Yeah, I just get a little bummed when my birthday's over.
Oh!! I love this job! Wow! My first call.
No!! You are getting married! This is all I have.
Well, you sure had a hell of a time at the wake!
Okay well Ross! Stop it please! Wait a minute!
I'm talking about a bet, winner takes all.
Oh, wait! Sorry, Mr. Paul? Mr. Paul?
Stop it! Cut it out! Cut it out!
Well, y'know this whole marriage thing, kinda my idea.
Y'know what, I want you to leave! Get outta here!
Did Joey say what he was gonna go when he left?
Well, y'know I was thinking of moving the couch over here.
Well, I hope the ends of these sentences are good.
Thank you! I had just gone to the beach that weekend.
Yeah, pretty nice, huh? Now who's a pushover?
Well-well a little blind sided but y'know good.
Oh, but y'know, no, you didn't give me your phone number.
Hi you. I can't believe I'm waking up next to you.
Oh Ross, hi! Hey, how are ya? There you are!
What's the big deal? Why don't you wanna see Janice?
Yah! She's... uhm... not very good though...
Oh my God! Oh Monica! Those boots are amazing!
Oh boy, I just can't watch. It's too scary!
You remember not having sex in high school, right?
Okay. Well be careful with her, she's really tiny.
It's just so frustrating! Why doesn't she want my breast?!
Sorry. Paolo's catching an earlier flight.
Well, then, you'll just have to eat the other lamps.
Oh! Phoebe, why did you lie to me about working here?
But y'know umm, Rachel doesn't rhyme with draddle.
Why did you invite him?? I can't stand that guy!
So, he's on the show, he knows what happens.
Yeah okay, you laugh now, but she's gonna be yours.
Guess what. Ben just said his first word.
Ok, I, I will do your laundry for one month.
We are looking for our Christmas presents from Monica.
Yes, I've done my studying and I really know my stuff.
Hey, how are those tapes working out for ya?
Joanna, this is my friend Chandler Bing Joanna.
Oh no, no, no. Oh God, you think I made out with him.
Don't say, "Oh my God!" Oh my God what?
Yeah, y'know I-I think I'm just gonna hang out in my room.
Ugh, Monica I don't want to steal your stupid thunder!
Yeah, I know... ..I'm I'm just not that bright either.
Oooooooooh. Oh, that's nice. Oh, oh. Huh, Ross!
Well, why don't you talk to me about it, maybe I can help.
Yeah, that was an awesome day! Opening credits.
Heyyyyy! Contraceptives are not always effective! Right?
Hey Mon, look what I just found on the floor. What?
Oh, thank God I can't hear a word that you're saying!
Well, I have a job interview at Ralph Lauren tomorrow!
Of course it's true and it hurts so bad.
Ohh, God, I just got so nervous that he would say no.
Shhh...I don't know what to do, this is totally unprecedented.
Do you even understand what off the rack means?!
So uh...I guess we should...make it official huh?
Well since I'm movin' out and-and you're so beautiful...
Hey guys do you think this is too slutty-Hi Kash!
Well how can that be, you were just kissing Sabrina?
Oh thank you so much Mr. Kaplan, thank you so much.
Well Monica seems to think it's because you have feelings for me.
Oh yeah, we were but umm, now we've got candy.
I'm doing just fine! God, Tiffany, you smell so great!
Oh... you're not gonna do a magic trick, are ya?
Do you have anything that would... get us out of them?
Yeah that's right! Come on Joey; sex me up!
Yes! Yes! Yes, you do want to know! This is unbelievable!
Ooh, I was kinda hoping that wouldn't be an issue...
Oh, lucky me! Coffee and a live sex show!
Why would a charity give away a free boat?!
Well, I guess I could take a couple days off work.
Oh yeah, now everybody wants to be under this hat!
Yeah! You-you got the job! You're my new assistant!
All right, who would uh, like some yams? Will?
Hello. Umm, when is your next flight to London?
Yeah, but if you spent it, it would be like shopping!
Oh my God, look-look he's taking off her clothes!
Sure, but come on, as big as your wedding?
Okay, well, I'm gonna clear out some of these boxes.
And yet she was worth jeopardising our relationship!!
But I saved it. I put my basket on top.
Well better than you, but y'know still not what you want.
Well, she told me. She said she's kinda a loner.
Oh, well, it pretty much sucked. How was yours?
Yeah, uh you-you probably need that for stamps, right?
Joey, what are you talking about? You're a terrific actor.
Hey! Those are all the things I'm responsible for!
Phoebe, how would you do this to me? This was all your idea.
That is not true. She did! She forced me!
No no, 'cause mayo, that would make it gross.
Okay. So, can I serve you a little of-What? What? What?
She's steaming her dress, why? What's up?
Monica, what is with you? Who'd you have lunch with?
Oh, I beg to differ. The Pictionary incident?
I mean we're not, we're not gonna live together anymore?
Oh wow, you didn't even try to unhook my bra!
Okay. Phoebe, I-I think Ross is right. What are we gonna do?
Hey-whoa, slow down. No, keep moving. Wow!
What? C'mon you guys, I don't care, I have a date tonight.
Come on. How can I just tell him? What about Julie?
No, I did, but tell me again, because it's so romantic.
Well, it was a little extravagant, but I a pretty good deal.
Ohh, I'm gonna miss that big old squishy butt.
Okay. . Hello Drake, I'm surprised to see you here.
And fifty. So it was like one and fifty dollars.
Oh honey thank God you're home, I was getting worried.
..so, he said it was just a sprain, and that was it.
What?! Joey got a turkey stuck on his head?!
Oh, umm, I was just y'know working out and umm... Oh, that's it.
Um, Pheebs, so, you guys just dont get along?
Oh wow! That deserves another piece of candy.
Return them?! Shh! They're gonna hear you!
No-no, seriously-seriously, what was the especially me part about?
All right, cut, let's pick again, pick again.
Go-go-go-go, come on! So uh, what did you find out?
No, no, no, I admire a man who can cry.
"Indeed there isn't"... I should really get back to work.
Oh yeah? Another night of birdogging the chickas?
Well... he happens to be a very nice... guy....
Ohh, there's a picture of her in the yearbook actually.
Ugh, okay, well somebody will come and save us.
You know what we should all do? Go see a musical.
Jean-Claude she said yes, I'll see you tonight. Thank you.
Well I just came... I just needed to tell you... Congratulations.
So, which of these babies do you think is the ugliest?
Well honey, then why don't you break up with one of them?
You were supposed to be in there so I could see your thing!
I cannot believe that you didn't tell me that we are still married!!
Well, why do y'know go in that room and do your homework?
But! Don't you have to give him his money back?
It'll never last, he's just a rebound roommate.
I know. Days of Our Lives, thank you very much.
Joey... are you sure? I mean, I know how much you love him!
Hey! Oh my God you're here, let me see your hand!!
Umm, I'm sorry. Do you-do you have a problem with me?
What a jerk! You want me to kick his ass?
How's Ross doing? Y'know since all the Emily stuff.
Ross, thank you. Hey, do you guys wanna go see a movie?
Joey! The wedding is in less than an hour!
All right, well that's good to know. Good night, Steve.
Hello. I need to get on the 11 o'clock flight.
Yeah, yeah, I was just about to take a break anyways, so...
You wanna go in the bedroom? It's a little more comfortable.
I'm sorry. All right, I'll just stay in here this time. Okay.
Ross! Y'know what, I just got-why? Why did you do this?!
And that crazy party animal will be your brother-in-law.
Okay fine, I did. But I didn't see anything, I swear.
Chandler, aren't you worried about what to get Monica for Christmas?
Why? Seriously I did not understand a word that you said.
OK, Ross, listen to me, I am not yours to save.
Oh, wait before you guys go, can I just ask you a question?
Oh God! Thank God you're home! I'm watching Cujo.
Yes, Chandler, that's exactly what it is. It's your hair.
My God. Okay. Ha-ha-ha beat ya! Sucker!
Ooh, this is soo sweet, Joey our little twinkle-toes.
Okay honey, now I'm gonna try to listen from right here!
Oh y'know what honey? Let's not talk about that right now?
Oh hi, Mr. Wineburg, hi Mrs. Wineburg.
Excuse us for a minute. You didn't tell her to come?!
Y'know, I don't-I don't know. Let me, let me check.
Oh. Look at you making up crap for me. Oh God!
Oh God, oh, and then she told the funniest story...
Oh thank you, Chandler, this is so great, she's gonna love me.
Yeah, looks that way. First ones here! Wooo!!
I didn't know then. And how come you never said anything to me.
Well, I have been spending a lot of time in the lab.
Uh, Mon, you-you gonna leave your shoes out here?
I... Am I the only one that this is embarrassing for?
We went through a lot of wine tonight, you guys.
Okay. Okay. Okay. Uh, what do I, what do I do with him?
Ross, seriously! You've gotta go to an appropriate doctor.
Oh my God! It's Joey Tribbiani of Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.!!!!!!!
Yeah, I-I-I-I'm funny Ben, but I'm not stupid. Okay?
Thank you. Oh, cool! Free sample of coffee!
They took Ben to the park. Where've you been?
What? Wait a minute, I didn't pay, I thought you paid!
Yeah, y'know what? I'm-I'm gonna meet you upstairs in a minute.
Oh, great could you make me four copies of those?
I can do that. I certainly did it when we were going out.
Okay. Hey, what are you thinking? What are you thinking right now?
But ah, you're safe from it if it's in the freezer?
You know, this happens all the time to my computer at work.
Y'know what? I don't, I don't think Phoebe really wants to come.
Ohhh, this is the least jealous I've ever been!
Yeah! It's weird. But the thing is need to find a date.
Please tell me you're not gonna dress up like a dinosaur.
Oh, isn't that adorable? Joey is afraid of the tarantula.
Oh okay, hey guys, would you flip mine too?
I don't know! I'm-I'm kinda thinking it-it was the lobster...
Oh, I really liked him. Yeah, it was really, really, really good.
Uh-huh, doing it. Doing it. Phone doing it.
No! Phoebes! Don't you remember why you dumped the guy?
Oh wait, Ross, would you just stay and help me get dressed?
Oh thank you! Thank you, thank you, thank you! Emily?
Your company has a fine foods division?
I was just asking 'cause I need someone to watch Emma tonight.
Ross, I watched you get hypnotised in Atlantic City.
No. She's going to live with us for eight weeks.
Well, we were going to do that after-I mean umm, next.
So does it really hurt as bad as they say?
Look, Chandler, he has moved on, OK, you have to too.
Hi! Okay, don't be mad at me, but I couldn't resist.
Well then you just must have a natural talent for it.
Oh yeah, what department was that? The Jerk department?
Come on! I don't want you thinking of me like that any more!
All right, you're the boss. I guess I gotta do what you tell me.
I'm not saying that I'm a lesbian! I'm just saying that this happened!
There's not gonna be a wedding. Ross and I are not getting married.
Oh, oh, oh, I'll get 'Rainy Day Bear'!!
Ya know, in crazy world, that means you're married.
Oh, little 'X's! Great! That makes up for everything!
And the ring, was the size of my fist !
I accidentally packed these with my stuff. Who is this?
No, you guys, you really don't have to go, we're done talking.
Okay, you look in the kitchen, I will look in the back closet.
I knew it! I knew it. Come on tell me your moves.
Monica, you should totally put your name down on the list
Okay, uhh, I think I'm going to run to the ladies room.
Thank you doctor. Oh thank you for being so nice and calm.
No, I'm sorry, we're all out of those. Anybody else?
Well, I'm gonna take a nap, turkey makes me sleepy.
I knew that! I knew that! I was just messin' with you too!
Y'know Ross why don't you put that on your answering machine!
Ross, hey you know what might make it less boring?
Honey, I'm sorry, but he's right. I love you, but you're crazy.
Well that sounds kinda cool, kinda like The Hobbit.
Oh, I guess. Except everything looks like jammies now.
Just when you thought that dude couldn't get any wierder.
OK, OK. So, you ever get a pet with a girlfriend?
Honey, stop it! I am not going to tell you until I tell him.
No, I haven't had a chance to be alone with him yet.
So, what, you're just, you're just okay with being flaky?
Okay, uh-uh imagine this, "The Mr. Bowmont."
No, no, not at the moment, no, I'm not. Are you?
Well that is because you have never been on a date with me before.
Phoebe you can't have both of them! You have to pick one!
Wow, everything looks so good! I think I'm gonna have the chicken.
Oh, it's so sad they never had a chance to meet.
Phoebe, it's me. I'm going to hunt you down and kill you!
Oh, thank you that's very helpful, I'm glad you came over.
You just don't look old enough to have a twenty-year-old daughter.
Yeah. Oh! Was how you invented the cotton gin?!
Yeah well, Ross just made plans for the whole century.
Huh-huh, no act--no, uhh, that, that is basil.
Okay, in about ten seconds you're gonna see him kiss me.
Yes, but you can not tell Ross 'cause I want to surprise him.
I am so gonna miss watching you freak people out like that!
No that's just--That's just 'cause I'm such a good messer!
Yeah, and-and you better make sure he tips you this time.
It's not a miracle Joey! I'm sure there's some explanation.
I'm not telling you what to do! I am telling you what not to do!
It is our first official date. Our first date.
Uh-hmm, uh-hmm, yeah, yeah, I really liked your hands.
Oh, no, no, I don't have one. I just need to talk to my friend.
I'm sorry, I was just thinking you're day could still pick up.
Yes, my sister's giving us her place for the weekend.
What? Hey! No-no-no! This not cool! You don't even know me!
Uh...no. No, no, in fact, you're not having a boy.
And sorta just put the receipt back in your pocket?
Ahhhh , you brought rats to my birthday party?
And y'know what else, oh my God, are they gonna love you.
I give up you guys, I don't know what I'm going to do with this thing!
Oh, big glamour night. Me and Monica at Laundorama.
Oo, I can't watch this, it's like Sophie's Choice.
You, you, you said he liked me. You, you slowpokes!
Oh, yes! We'll have ourselves a little baby Ruth...
: Step away from the crib, I have a weapon!
Oh! Oh, I just thought of the greatest wedding gift to get you.
Great, people having sex, that's just what I need to see.
So you'll definitely get onstage, even if you don't win.
Oh, wow! Congratulations, that's quite a waste of time.
I am not gonna get fired, because I'm not gonna act on it.
That's easy for you to say, you weren't almost just killed.
You don't understand! You didn't see how brazen she was.
Oh yeah well, you know me, babies, responsibilities, ahhh!!!
So did I. I'm really glad Monica asked us out.
Hey! Ross, listen can you come to a charity event tonight?
I don't know... I mean, I've never looked at you that way before.
Yeah and you had fun teaching him how to be all Joey.
Huh. Wow, I wouldn't think Hobbs would like that so much.
No, actually I took it off then I drew it back on.
Because you are my sister and Ross and I have this huge history...
Thank you. OK. Machine. Just waiting for the beep.
All right, well, everybody just remember where they were sitting.
Alright, fine, you go ahead and you do that, alright Ross.
Oh, sure! Do you need me to train somebody new?
Okay. Hey. Umm. Does everybody hate these shoes?
On someone's lips? Where'd you get the hickey?
Oh, not as a friend, Phoebe!! Fine, I won't use it!
God. I have never been so uncomfortable in my entire life!
From the guy in the bar, why didn't I get that message?
I could, I could but I don't want to! I want to kiss Joey!
Joey, would you just come out here and stop being such a baby!
I was faking it! Can't you tell when I'm being fake?
Okay, see now I'm scared because I don't actually think you're kidding.
Wait a minute! What do you mean, you're taking over my job?
Oh great! Suddenly she sounds like a biblical whore.
Yeah, it is! But you're just a kid! I mean you're 25!
Well, I'll be waiting for you, just come up when you're done.
Ooh, and it's so nice having this little sink here...
Hey, hey, hey, hey, quit making up rules!
Chandler, what are you doing? There is a trash can right there.
Or. We could put a hat on his head.
Okay, but Monica, what if- what if it doesn't come together?
Wow. Well, I guess it was Cupid who brought her here.
But mom, I really know what I'm doing. I can handle this.
All right Monica, do you want to know why I was with Ross tonight?!
I know, but all that work you're doing to get it ready, I just...
Yeah, I'm not so sure you should be here when he comes up.
Oh, OH! Wow, I love those! Where did you get them?
Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing?
That's great, great. So do you have any questions for us?
Well, the first time didn't really count... I mean, y'know, 's'Barry.
Pheebs, if I had never met him this never would have happened!
All right, so... Ross, you're ok with all this? I mean...
Oh, no, no, no. Presents first. Food later.
Joey, why don't you just tell her what happened? It's not your fault.
Oh my god, I can't believe you let me put this in my mouth.
Maybe it was just the kind of story where you have to be there.
Hi. Umm, I think there's something that we really need to talk about.
Well, I'm sorry I went out with him when I knew you liked him.
Honey, we have to go. Our reservations are at 8:00.
Ross, you got that for free from the museum gift shop.
Yeah, and you know what? You're right, I do feel better, thank you Ross.
Oh, but he was my pig man...how did I not see this?
Oh no, I really don't want any--Oh! Thank you. Oh. Oh Ross...
She's ok, I just don't get a really good vibe from her!
Well! Is everybody else having just the best time?!
I'm sorry, too! OH GOD! I shouldn't have said anything!
Yes! I'd love to! Have her come by the office.
I'm sorry honey, I'm just having a, having a rough day.
Oh, wait, Joshua! Joshua! Yeah, well, that oughta do it.
Hmm. Kinda stepped on my point there, Mon.
Yeah, all right. All right! Just keep walkin'! All right?
Hi. What are you doing here? Isn't this against the rules?
You walked around all night in the city by yourself?
Would you excuse me, please? I'm trying to have a date here.
Well, last night you seemed to know your way around the table.
well watching sharks? Are you sure that's what he was doing?
What? What do you mean, "there you are"? Where was she?
You're so sweet. Oh my God! And you gave the baby Hugsy!
Um, excuse me Gavin, I have a question I need to ask you.
I am not horsing around okay? I am Porsching around.
Well, then, you know, couldn't she have just copied my haircut?
No, he said we were holding up the people behind us.
So I'll bring her by around seven? Is that okay?
Thank you. Oh Joey and look at this crib! It's so cute!
Please! We did not fog Danny! Who's Danny?
Op, but the twelfth brings a lover's spat.
Wow, a Swedish massage from a real Swedish person.
Wait no, honey, honey throw it to me, throw it to me.
Ross, I am telling you that she is using you to get back at me!
Well, so, now, do you guys have a lot of big plans?
Look Ross, if you're so freaked out, just get in the car!
Well, sure! Come in! Well, what-what happened to your girlfriend?
You can't just say, 'Nice to meet you, good night?'
In case you didn't notice, that is a scary man.
No Ross! Ross! Ross! My child has no father!
She's actually very sweet and we used to be very close.
I didn't see anything! I actually changed my mind about the name.
Maybe. But just a little one. Phoebe got the whole world.
Well, hon-ey. I'm just trying to look nice for your big night.
Oh. Do you want to watch the rest of the movie with me?
Well, I like the pretty little drawing of you in the wedding dress.
Tommy's supposed to be here soon, we're going to lunch.
Joey, do you have peanut butter on the back of your head?
Oh god, waddawe do, waddawe do, waddawe do?
Well, no. That's impossible. You can never be too Alan.
Oh yeah, Joey broke it. Had to get rid of it.
Okay, all right, give me the mug! I'll keep the mug.
Aahh, I'm a... chef at a restaurant uptown.
Okay, well, that's one less thing we have to do on Monday.
Oh, hi Mrs. Lynch! Is Joanna in already?
Ohh, I just don't think I have enough left on my credit card.
All right, first name on the speed dial is mom.
Oh, that would be great! I love him, I love him, I love him...
Joey! It is an auction! You don't guess, you buy!
Is there room on that step for a pathetic loser?
Umm, well let's see uh, this one is Tom Brokaw.
Oh yeah? Startin' to feel her again there are we?
So that there will be a decent place for me to sit.
OK, you wanna play? OK, let's play, let's play.
Yeah, y'know what? Don't look at it. Seriously, don't look at it.
Joey, there is a perfectly good couch across the hall!
Oh it's umm, it's tofu cake. Do you want some?
I know. At dusk. That's such a hard time for me.
Oh, Ross, c'mon. It's my fault, I almost lost your...
Oh, no problem. I'm so glad I could help. Happy for you.
"Well, but I'm not sure I really want to do anything about it."
Look! This is ridiculous. We should be packing you!!
Oh honey, don't worry. I really do feel like tomorrow's the day.
Ugh, horrible! I did the stupidest, most embarrassing thing!
Phoebe, your in pain, would you just go to the dentist, just go.
Oh, you are a petty man. You are a petty, petty....
Yeah, they were very y'know...wrestley. But, I guess that's normal?
Are you asking me to move out? Do you not want me here?
Now! Give him the sandwich! Give him the sandwich!
Oh it's OK. You were worth the wait, and I don't just mean tonight.
No, no, thats OK. Y'know, I think I'm gonna give it a go.
Well, isn't that a good thing? You said you were sick of this.
I'm so sorry! No I'm sorry! No I'm sorry! No I'm sorry!
Y'know what, you are mean boys, who are just being mean!
Yeah. I'm gonna have a baby. I'm gonna have a baby. I'm gonna have a baby!
No honey, we're sorry, we didn't mean it. I love you. I love you.
Hey! How's it going? Did you make any new friends?
Ross, honey, it's a nice couch. It's not a magic couch.
My boss, Joanna? Wow, that must've been awkward.
Hey-hey, now he's showing us his poking device.
What?! You-you actually thought that basket was gonna get you the apartment?
Well, I told him I would think about it, but I'm gonna tell him no.
Hi, I'm sorry, I need to borrow your phone for just one minute.
Awww, no, it's okay, we've actually known for a while.
I'm so not impressed. Everybody snacks when they shop.
Oh God. Oh I can't believe Joey Tribbiani heard me throw up!
Joey stop staring! There's nothing there! It's not true!
Oh, Joey, you know what, no-one is gonna be able to tell.
We're waiting for you to open the door. You got the keys.
Monica, nothing has even happened yet, and you're already so...
Oh, no, no! I heard you before, that is so not what this is!
Well, I used to date him, but you're still going out with her!
What...? Too sensitive to take care of our baby?
I'm not gonna gooo, so I think that will accomplish the not going.
Look, Ross, he's just... Sandy is just sensitive, that's all.
Well, I gotta get up early and it's almost seven o'clock.
Hey Phoebs, how'd it go with Scott last night?
Which you're not, because you've totally hung up on him!
Oh my God Ross! What in heaven's name are you doing here?
So uh, heard you had some fun with Tag last night.
I'm not! This is what I'm doing now. I've got this job-
No, these aren't all my suitcases. This one's Paolo's.
I-I am not uptight-Hey-hey-hey-oh-oh! Listen, I am not uptight, man.
Oh, name one stupid thing that is as stupid as this one!
And I hope Barry doesn't kill you and eat you in Aruba.
Oh no? Pheebs? Monica? Do I know anything about babies?
Wow. Wow, that's great. Great. Ok, wow, you know what.
I mean I got news for you mister, Emma? Not easy.
I would love to live with you Ross; that's-that's great! Thank you!
God, oh God Monica, I forgot. This is our first date.
So umm, you're gonna stay with me as long as I need you?
I know, I just didn't want to wear my glasses on my first date.
So did they call you to tell you your name's gonna be in this?
Yeah, I don't know who I was kidding. I can barely use chopsticks.
See Pheebs, I promised you no one would die, didn't I?
Am I the only one who doesn't think that she's hot? Ross?
C'mon, you guys, what're we gonna do, what're we gonna do?
Noo! Oh God we did-we didn't, we didn't uhh...
Oh but Joey, I have to go. There's no room for a baby here.
Shhhhh! Phoebe! All right, look. I have a little thing for him.
Oh my God! Oh my God! I can't go! I'm gonna be too nervous!
Yes, you have to get her something, and it should be something really nice.
Really?! Got a little crush on Tag there do ya?
Anyway sweetie, I am, I'm so sorry I ruined your night.
Ooh! My Chinese food! Let me get my cash!
Joey, I think everyone saw the wine come out of your nose.
Tommyyyy! Say, what's your favourite thing about summer?
Okay! I'll go with ya! I'll go! I'll go with ya.
Hey! Have you guys seen Jill? I can't find her anywhere.
How does going to a strip club help him better?
No. No, she told me his name was Ken Adams.
Yeah, yeah... It's... "climax your way to better skin".
What?! Joey, you don't want to go on a date with a pregnant lady.
And while I'm gone don't you boys sneak a taste.
You had to do it, didn't you? You couldn't just leave it alone.
All right I know, I know how it looks Pheebs, but I'm telling you...
So forcing her to marry Bobby is gonna make that happen?
Noo, that's our unbelievably loud upstairs neighbor.
I just, Phoebe, said y'know thought she saw something between you guys.
Come on, Terry, I'll even clean the cappuccino machine.
Yeah, I-I heard. I think it's great! Ohh, I'm so happy for you!
Nothing else worked. That girl is all about the ass...
Well maybe it would make me feel better if I slept with Joey.
Oh, y'know what? I can't. I have to have dinner with that Melissa girl.
Ok, off the top of my head... Don and Janet.
Eavesdropping. Pheebs, the ceiling tiles were falling down.
Oh, yeah. Oh, I loved him in those cell phone commercials.
No, I'm not blushing, I'm sunburnt! From, you know, the rain.
Thank you Joey. You know what? I'm not even sure I can have caffeine.
Well first, for forgetting to throw you a bridal shower.
I just- I don't think us getting back together is a good idea.
After our date last night, did you feel a little weird?
Monica look! Look-look-look! Here is that table that I ordered.
Bye bye Mike!/Cya mike!/Bye mike!/Bye bye now!
Okay. Okay, that's him! That's him! That's Cujo! That's Cujo!
No, the other thing. I really think it's great they work things out.
Hey Ross! Check it out! I learned a new trick!
Yeah, but it's okay, because when Ross left Mark came over.
I mean why, of all people would you want to go out with Chip?!
Ooh... oooh... oh, ah... Can I ask you a question?
Nothing! Oh God, we're just so excited that you want to get this apartment!
Awww, stop. Come on. Now go shave that head!
You give me back my sweater or it's handbag marinara.
Honey, you can say it, Poconos, Poconos, it's like Poc-o-nos
Oooooh. : Oh! I got an interview! I got an interview!
Uh- which one of us are you talking to there, Barr?
Why would you even want to come Ross? You're a horrible skier.
Yeah? Wow! Y'know, that this thing has speakers in the headrest!
Hi, uh, nothing. That horrible woman just took my machine.
He's downstairs getting the rest of the stuff out of the cab.
O-okay, now see, you never ever ever told us that...
Okay, walk us through it, honey, walk us through it.
Oh-oh, Pottery Barn! You can throw the rest away.
What are you? Monica!! Stop it!! Oh my God! Stop it!
Ok, I just, I just really need to be with myself right now. I'm sorry.
Oh, umm, okay, yeah, I'll be, yeah I'll be right back.
Maybe Joey's right. Maybe all good deeds are selfish.
Oh! Well let's look for them. Oh-oh-hey! Are these them?
Oh, it's a gift certificate to this new SPA in SOHO.
Alright, just put your hands out and I'll back up into them.
Hi! Thanks, hey so uh what'd you do last night?
Oh...see... but Joanne loved Chachi! That's the difference!
I don't care! The wires have come loose in your head!
I'm telling you it's like watching Bambi learn how to walk.
Oh, this is great! I am gonna call him right now! Oh, thank you!
Fine. Hi! Yes, I'd like to order a large pizza.
Hi! Ok, you're ready to go pick up Phoebe and go shopping?
Oh my God! I can't believe you guys are actually think you're moving in here!
And do you remember going into my purse and stealing the phone?!
Oh, ok, thank you. Do you see what all the guys see in her?
Oh! Well you're just the prettiest ballerina I've ever seen.
Show cat! Quality show cat! Show cat!
I lied! And I'm not sick! Just stay behind the curtain!
Oh my God! It sure didn't look this way when I lived here.
Shoot, shoot, this is never gonna work! He's right there!
Y'know you're-you're probably wondering about the old date on there.
She'll be a much better friend when the market closes.
Oh my God! Was she old? Does she have a view?
Okay, do you see, do you see what you're keeping me married too?!
Sure, I'll just sit next to the trans-sexual from purchasing.
Every day, you are becoming more and more like your mother.
Umm, or, maybe, I should stay away from all men.
Oh my God, its happening. It's already started. I'm Kip.
Well guys tend to get naked before they're gonna have sex.
Okay. Oh wait! Umm, did you send those contracts to Milan?
Oh yeah! Y'know, if it's not a headboard, it's just not worth it.
Oooh... ***I really can't hear what she says*** come here.
When certain people leave the table and I am not finished!
G.I. Joe? Do you really think he's gonna fall for that?
Oh God, she mu... she must need her diaper changed.
Hi. Tag, I have a conference call today is that correct?
Joey! Why did we have to rush out of there so fast?!
Great! It went great. Really great. Hey, is that wine?
Okay, you hard worker! I'll remember to put that in your evaluation.
I'll take a coffee. So how was your big date last night?
Hey, that is the...baby's problem. Oh, everything okay with the waiter?
I will not! I'm the divisional head of men's sportswear!
Joey. Joey, something feels weird and not good weird. I don't-Whoa!!
Oh, oh my God! I can practically hear the mahjong tiles!
No, it was a stupid bet! We were just playing a game!
Yeah. It was after the party, we were on the balcony and...
Paul. Umm, I just wanted you to know that Ross really is a great guy.
Yeah! You can hook it up to your TV and you get radio!
Yeah, well just be glad he's not playing a smaller instrument.
Ross! Phoebe's gonna be here any second, she cannot see this!
Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no, that's OK, I don't need them. I'm going for fours.
Yes, Joanna really has been an incredible mentor to me.
You are not. You have never been able to break up with her.
Oh wait, don't you have to pay for your, Busty Ladies?
It's my father. He wants to give me a Mercedes convertible.
Okay, Pheebs, you look in the kitchen, I will look in the back closet.
Oh, Chandler!! All right, this is it! You never see Joanna again!
Oh umm, y'know I lent it to Joey and I never actually got it back.
Well, y'know, if-if kids like to play with Capri pants.
Maybe. I-I don't know-Oh God, how could I be so stupid?!
Assistant buyer. Oh! I would be shopping... for a living!
Well, y'know, possibly. You didn't tell him that, though? Right?
Hey, do you believe this? Do you believe they are actually getting married?
Well, I have to say that earns tutu pieces of candy.
Dad, dad. We got it!! We Got It!!!
Look, um, I think we should talk about what happened on the terrace.
Uh, no she doesn't but I can, I can get a message to her.
He was a hamster! I am not going to vacuum up my baby!
Oh wait, no-no-no! Drag me down. Drag-drag me down.
Oh, God, no problem. So you're gonna go with the uh, waiting thing?
Well wait a minute, what happened to Days of Our Lives?
Uh, it's from yore. Like the days of yore. Y'know?
He-he said Rachel, right? Do you think I should go up there?
Okay, it's not Relaxi Cab. It's Relaxicab, like taxicab.
Wow! Umm, y'know, I-I would really love to, but I-I shouldn't.
Hi, my name is Rachel Green, I have an appointment for Emma.
No. No, I don't. Could you be a dear and go tell him?
Oh, I can't believe I ever let him touch me with those fingers.
I mean n-not-not fake at all like most famous people.
Okay uh, but before you do that. I-I, I need you to talk to me.
Horrible and degrading list of reasons not to be with me?
Ok, good-bye you guys. Thanks for everything. Oh, sorry! Oh, sorry!
Oh thank you. Hey y'know, I'm so sorry to hear about you and Elizabeth.
Yeah! Right! Okay, I'll see you guys later. Woo hoo!
I know. I'm sorry. Look, I'll make a deal with you all right? Okay?
Oh Joey! Joey! No, it's not you! You didn't get anybody pregnant!
So what's the final head count on my baby shower?
Pie in the hood, pie in the hood. Go.
What? What kind of a regatta gala starts at night?!
Well, have you been involved with someone where you haven't broken up?
Oh, god, I can't believe one of us actually has one of these.
Oh as, as opposed to your other multi-functional nipples?
Oh God. You did. You heard. Ok, listen, let me explain.
That went well. Almost everybody knew that she was a girl.
Oh, hey! Hi, there you are, I've been looking for you everywhere!
Hi! Oh, Ross, don't forget, we have that doctor's appointment tomorrow!
Yeah, because I was mad at you, not because I stopped loving you!
Of course they're listening to you! Everybody listens to you.
No! There's no orange juice in there! We win!!
This is easy...Can't do this! Oh! Wow! Seriously I can't do this.
Oh God... Okay. Alright. Alright. Okay. Ross, please don't hate me.
Now, if you will excuse me I am going to go and lie down.
You mean the mom you met in Montauk. She was a cat?!
Oh, I have to go tell Monica what a wonderful brother she has!
Oh! Oh, I think I'm gonna throw up a little bit. What did you say?
Ohh, it's me and La Poo! Wow! I miss that dog.
No!! No! He's not married, or involved, with anyone!
Oh Monica come on, y'know I don't sleep with guys on the first date!
Basically, there's the thing, and then there's the stuff after the thing.
I was giving you an appology and you were totally checking her out!
Oh, come on! You think that's gonna work on me?! I invented that!
I ah, will buy and wrap all of your Christmas gifts.
I'm fine, but that's not important. What's important is how was she?
Oh, well, actually we were just talking about me not going to Ross's wedding.
Well, for starters I would've said the right name at my wedding!
Oh, well, I...It's kind of weird talking to you about this, but...
Well, the cat... the cat turned out to be Paolo's cat!
I've just been thinking about how my baby and I are gonna be all alone.
Monica, your Sweet Sixteen was like a million years ago.
No? So you're saying that if I called it, it wouldn't ring?
Wow! They really got you guys. Your T.V. The chairs.
Oh God! This is silly, I'm gonna see you in a couple of hours!
Yes! She's gonna help us take care of the baby! Woo-hoo.
Hello?! Oh, yeah! This is gonna be a while. Excuse me. Yeah!
I know, that old lady at the end was ready to take you home.
Shhh don't say that loud, Gunther's gonna want to hug me.
December 26th, huh maybe she's Santa Clause.
Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me, excuse me, sorry. Hi.
Pam! Oh God okay, just imagine this, "The Pam."
Oh really?! Then how come all your stuff is in this box?!
Oh my God, I'm starting to look like my great aunt, Muriel.
Yeah, 'cause that's why you won't get Isabella Rosselini, geography.
All right, well the place was closed. I'll just copy it later.
Yeah it's umm... Yeah it's uh... It-it's y'know-It's nothing.
Oh, I so wanted Ross to know first, but I'm so relieved you guys know.
I'm sorry, they were just all coming at me, and I didn't know what to do.
So. I mean, who here does not have the time to get to know Julie?
Yeah, sure. All right, whose court is the ball in now?
Oh Daddy, no he didn't mean anything by that, he really didn't.
Oh, I'm sorry, were you speaking to me or sleeping with someone else?
...I just don't know if the world is ready for you and your bag.
So, what do think you wanna order? I'm really excited about that chicken.
Did we speak on the phone last night? Did you call me?
Joey, y'know that you could just not throw the sticks up in the air.
Oops. Sorry! Well, good thing you number all of them, huh?
Sure. I guess. Hey, I hear you don't have to go to London. Yay!
Vogue! Hey, so tell me about this Jane Eyre woman.
Ok, that's it! Just give'em to me! I'll split them up!
Oh, that is so sweet. I think I'm falling in love with you all over again.
Kind of ditzy? Too into her looks? Spoiled?
You are. Well, um... We, we, we were just... Wow!
Well, I don't get it, but she wanted me to give you her phone number.
No! Come on its late, we're not gonna go down to the office.
Ahh, I don't believe you. I think you don't want them to see you begging me.
Don't let him in! I'm supposed to be at a regatta gala.
Yeah, maybe if you gave this girl a chance it would go somewhere.
He's got this thing. And I keep telling him to go to my chiropractor...
Really?! You think so? Y'know, I had just rolled out of bed.
Wait-wait-wait, I just thought of another story about how nice Ross is!
Of course! Oh Joey, this ring I...it's beautiful I love it!
Oh okay, I'll fix that to. What's her e-mail address?
Ohh, out, oh God, I don't know why we didn't think to check there!
Yeah I know, and I bet you thought it would be weird. But it's not!
Yeah it is, it is. We really, really have to do something about that.
Ross, it took you ten years to finally admit you liked me.
Hi! Well, we were just about to take off and see a movie. Oh no!
Oh no-no-no-no-no, no, no! We, you with someone and me with someone.
Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh Chandler!! You guys are gonna be so happy!
No. Not-not for me, but why don't you take off your sweater?
Ohh wow! I'm sorry, but Ross you kicked off your shoes!
Joey, is what she just said umm-Oh my God. You were actually gonna...
Come on! Serious-ser-ser-seriously, what did she mean by that? Especially you!
So uh, apparently people are familiar with the Europe story?
Well, y'know he lost his keys so he was looking for them...
Yes, you do. When we left, you said, "got the keys."
Hi. Well hey, you don't - you don't think they're kind of cool?
Oh yeah! Oh my God! That is our friend! It's Naked Ross!
Ohh, thank you for my beautiul earrings, they're perfect. I love you.
No, no, no, no turtles scare me. I don't need that today.
That's fine. So Monica, you are now in control of my love life.
What, as part of your poor friends outreach program?
Wow, that's great Ross, I'm sorry we weren't more supportive before.
No because first they arrest the guy and then they try him.
Yes, his name is Barry, he's a doctor, thank you very much.
Yeah! Ohh, I've been waitin' so long to get on that body!
Oh, I probably shouldn't-so I will! Oh! Wow! It's like it's raining!
Okay honey, you do realize she only spins like that on ice.
Monica, why? Why would I ever want to take away from your night?
Well umm, maybe we could uhh... Ah-ha! Too slow!!
Oh my God, Melissa Warburton. I don't think I have the energy for this.
So ah, did you have fun at the bachelor party last night?
I don't know, I don't know. Urrrgh! Look, maybe we should take a break.
I'm having dinner with my dad tomorrow night, do you wanna come?
Okay-okay-okay! So, making things. That sounds like so much fun.
Well then let's just quit! We'll just quit! Let's all quit!
Y'know, I gotta tell ya, I just loved your look when you were bald.
I see your fifty cents... and I raise you... five dollars.
Okay, well that's now the third sign that I should not leave Emma.
'Gone for more jars. Back later. Monica Geller.'
All right, fine! But I had too! I had to do it for my career!
Well you uh, you were always really good at the uh, at the uh the stuff.
Hey, did you guys check out those new hand-dryers in the bathroom?
All right fine! You're not invited to the party we're gonna have either.
You may need to use this year to teach Ben about Phoebe.
Ok well, I heard that! Which means that she heard it too!
Hey Joey, is this the bed where Olivia lost her virginity?
Central Perk is proud to present Miss Phoebe Buffay.
Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. See Phoebe, Phoebe.
Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated?
How-how did end up in Vermont with that awful witch?!
So uh, Pheebs, honey, how are those mood swings coming?
Oh, I win! He's got Barney's on his speed dial.
Wow, Monica, you look just like your grandmother. How old was she there?
Guys! Guess what, guess what, guess what, guess what!
Wow! It looks like the Easter Bunny's funeral in here.
Ross honey, this is very nice, but, but I-I got a crisis.
Well, believe me, it's been a long time since I've been flung.
Hey! Everybody hide! Hide! I saw her! She's coming!
Well then Joey, what the hell were you doing with an engagement ring?!
Fancy soap? I thought we were savin' that for the Pope!
Umm, when were you gonna tell me that you're going out with Chip Matthews?
Well in High School, that added up to head cheerleader.
So tell me, what are Joey Tribbiani's end of the night moves?
You know what honey, you go ahead, we'll call her an alternate.
How did we end up with these jerks? We're good people!
No, it was on the house, it was, it was a newlywed special.
I mean do you have any fun, you know, fantasy type things?
Take 'em! Joey, you can touch them! They're your underwear.
Y'know, I gotta tell ya, this really does put in a better mood.
Well, it's a long story, but umm I broke Joey's chair...
Ok, I've got one. Wow, those things almost never come true.
Oh does it matter?! All that matters is that you look so handsome.
Listen, y'know what? I was really freaked out too when I found out...
Oh wow, uh okay, uh maybe. Umm, yes, I can do that!
All right, I gotta go to bed. Honey, I had such a wonderful time.
But it was beautiful. I mean it was small, but kind of spectacular.
No! Shoot, Dr. Schiff what kind of question is that?!
Oh! I'm sorry! Are we having an 89-year-old? How about Dayton?
Excuse me! But this is a purebred, show-quality Sphinx cat!
No, no, no.... the, um, the... 'love' part?
Ohh, he's married! Ross is married. I can't-I still can't believe it.
Oh my God, what a great surprise! This is such a beautiful house.
Umm, I think there was a restaurant... I know there was wine. . .
Oh it was perfect! I mean it really felt like he was my friend again.
I'm trying to put Emma down for a nap, have you seen Hugsy?
Oh yeah. I used to babysit him. Hey, how's his dad?
Well it's hard to tell... Oh God, if she would just stop moving.
Well hello! Welcome to Monica's. May I take your coat?
Ok... uh... maybe you're not always going after the wrong girl...
Yes! And he said really mean things that were only partly true.
Oh look who it is, my husband. The apple of my eye.
Pheebs is your grandmother maybe saying that you should live here alone?
I mean is that woman capable of talking about anything else but sex?
Oh, what do you, you want me to stop seeing him, is that what you want?
Monica, what is so amazing? I gave up, like, everything. And for what?
No, but I was doing my thing and everything was going according to the plan!
Okay, that doesn't help me, because we went to the same high school.
Excuse me, Dr. Bobby happens to be an excellent doctor.
Umm let me think...What do I want, what d-o I w-a-n-t...
Yeah, remember that thing I told you that happened yesterday? Well it didn't happen.
Joey! Why did you tell Chandler that Monica was getting a boob job?
What-what, wait a minute, you don't think that's why he wants me back?
Well, you're the one who wants to fire him, so you're gonna have to do it.
Oh my God!! Do it!! Honey, you've waited long enough!!
"Dear Rach, you're a great person. Sorry about your tiney-wienie."
Ohh! Yeah! Yeah that-that would've been a much simpler problem.
But Joey the baby is going to be crying, it's going to be loud.
Yeah, right, he almost danced me right down that...garbage chute.
Ohh-ho-hooohhh. The hair comes out, and the gloves come on.
Uh, I don't know. Why don't you put it right here next to my water?
Oh, great. Although I did sit down where there wasn't a chair.
And with Chandler in the next room. What are you, what are you sick?
Come on apartment! Come on apartment! Oh! I know queen is high!
Oh, come on! This is crazy! Can't we just flip a coin?!
We don't want it-it to be too much, we want it to be subtle.
He was right there. He got down on one knee and proposed.
Yes! Great! Give me those cigs! Give it! Give it!
No, I-I-I-I don't, I actually don't know who I'm talking about! So!
Ohhh... Okay, you were right. You were right! This was just not worth it.
Chandler and Monica?!! Oh, this is unbelievable!! How long have you known?
Oh, there you are! Hi! Oh, so, so, how was China, you?
What? He said 'we should do it again', that's good, right?
No-no, they just had a big blowout over what to do with my room.
Please, Ross, you-you got hurt playing badminton with my dad.
Well, now, how come you guys have never played poker with us?
Oh uh-huh, uh-huh, coffee, a little rub-rub-rub under the table.
Well, I wouldn't know because I got so freaked out that I hung up the phone.
Or...I could call in sick and not deal with it at all...
It's left sweetie, but that's okay sweetie, that's a tough one.
Yeah? Well, you should know. You've bought like a billion of 'em.
Okay, then y'know what? Help me! I need help! I can't do this!
Oh that's right! I'm sorry! I-I am early! Finish! Please!!
Phoebe! You picked Joey and Ross?! You can not have two backups!
Oh, come on! I'll give you ten free Ralph Lauren shirts.
Well, you ripped the paper out of the court reporter's machine!!
Oh, oh no. Do you think she walked in, saw you and left?
Joey, I'm really sorry that I lied to you. I was just trying to make things...
I bet he sensed that I was ready to have sex with another guy.
I cannot believe you guys! He was really nice and he left because of you!
Uh... Oh, Mindy, you are so stupid. Oh, we are both so stupid.
No. No-no-no-no, no. I mean, don't do that. Not, I mean not for me.
No, no, no, wait! Okay, okay. Don't! I'll go, I'll go!
Yeah and we'll drop it off downstairs so that we're not tempted.
All right! Y'know what? That's it! You wanna do it?! Let's do it!
Why do you care about the guy who won the Paris trip?
Ooh, Pheebs, what are you gonna say? Are you gonna tell him who you are?
Well honey, I'm late for a meeting. So can you just make it quick?
Hi. Thanks for the party, honey. Should I help you clean up?
Ohh! I would kill for a salmon skin roll right now!
Yeah fun? Great! So uh, so did you guys hit it off?
C'mon, seriously, you guys, you're not going to make me watch this alone!
Oh well actually gonna use a nanny and uh, I don't even have a housekeeper.
Okay Ross that's fine, but can you please stand near my head?
Ahhh, I think you look great! That bag is gonna get you that part.
Honey, listen, y'know what? The nurse said the doctor is wonderful.
What?! Me?! What about you and your consummated like bunnies nonsense!
I can't believe I don't get to go to my own prom, this is so harsh.
Joey, y'know you get any mustard on that bag, you can't return it.
You know that depends on what it is! I've done a lot of stuff.
Yes, we are very sorry to tell you this, but you, Phoebe, are flaky.
Ah! Well it was Joey reading Drake's lines in the dream...
Okay. All right, that's true! But y'know I just don't embarrass that easily.
All right honey, we'd better go if we wanna catch that movie.
Well, I-I-I've been on Standby for a flight home for hours.
Y'know what? That's a lot to remember, can't I just tell her you're a pig?
Ohh, gee. I wonder why she thinks you're going to call her?
So that we would have something to talk about! So it wouldn't be awkward!
Oh. Hi. We just found this cat and we're looking for the owner.
I can see that. You look like you slept with a hanger in your mouth.
Oh, thank you for doing that. I just can't deal with this just quite yet.
I feel like we're the only two people in the world. Oops. Sorry.
Ok actually Mon, Matthew was just giving me his phone number.
Uh-hmm. I'm just thinking about Phoebe; poor knocked up Phoebe.
Oh my God! Yes, I would love that, oh, that is soo sweet, Joey.
What? It's true, my right leg is two inches shorter.
Well, I should be involved in that, so why don't you get me up to speed?
You know how much I love that T-shirt! You never even where that T-shirt!
Wow! I definitely did not see that one backfiring! I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
Yeah! Hi Emma. Hey, why do you think she won't take my breast?
No, why do we always have to do everything according to your time table?
That's not her name! I'm sorry, she just doesn't feel like an Isabella.
Oh yeah! Actually, that's one of the reasons why we're not a couple.
No, hey, come on, if he asked you first, that's only fair.
That would be great! Wait, how long is Denise gone for?
Oh. Oh, those little clunky Amish things you think go with everything.
Full, dry, on its back, and no loose covers.
Yeah, he thought he broke your chair so he switched the chairs!
Well, it's embarrassing. People were looking at us like we were crazy.
I'm more than okay, I am really, really happy! Wanna know why?
Ross, you have to understand that your nice thing makes us feel this big.
Joey, you can't keep this to yourself, if you know about this, you have to tell him.
