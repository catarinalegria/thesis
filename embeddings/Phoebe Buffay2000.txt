Well, I-I wasn't hopping mad, y'know.
Okay, alright, I have a question, then.
All right, stop it, you're freaking me out.
Oh!!
Oh God, here we go. For the first time in my life I'm gonna say 'Hi birthfather'.
Oh! I can't believe it. I can't believe this. We're just like, sitting at home, trying to guess Joey's fingers, and you guys are out like partying and having fun, and you know, all, "hey, Blowfish, suck on my neck".
About what?
Oh yeah, like you never called!
Kills you?
I know where Minsk is.
Oh. It was a long shot. Hey, you guys can I just like have a second alone with the babies.
I can't help it. I need the meat. The baby needs the meat.
Wow, look at these prices.
I don't know. I haven't been out on a date in so long.
Well, he came in for a massage, and everything was fine until.
All right, stop it. Now you're just doing it to freak me out.
Yeah, I know, but I don't think that means anything.
All right, so let's switch.
I think it's just y'know that I haven't been with a guy in so long and how sometimes you're looking for something and you just don't even see that it's right there in front of you sipping coffee-Oh no, have I said to much? Well it's just something to think about. I know I will.
Great, all right, okay, and Monica ask me to make the drumming stop.
Why? Why do I have to learn?
No it's just that I got this new pager and I have it on vibrate. See ya!
OK, that's my tattoo.
I mean, well, 'cause when I was growing up, you know my dad left, and my mother died, and my stepfather went to jail, so I barely had enough pieces of parents to make one whole one. And here's this little baby who has like three whole parents who care about it so much that they're fighting over who gets to love it the most. And it's not even born yet. It's just, it's just the luckiest baby in the whole world. I'm sorry, you were fighting.
Marcia and Chester.
Oh.
Hang on! Hang on! Hang on! Go!! Who's this? Oh okay, you're gonna like working for me. What's your name? What kind of name is Brendy? I... Whatever... Stop talking! All right, from now on your name is Joan. You can pick your own last name.
No, it's not! We were just goofing around and I dared him to try them on.
Oh, I...
Hey!
Oh, look at little Leslie stretching in her sleep.
Ohh!
Oh no, how?
My massage client, Arthur? His daughter called and said that some guy that worked for me gave him a really weird massage this afternoon.
Sorry. How about over here?
Your getting married?!
Yeah, so please, please, please, don't say anything to Chandler.
Fine! Be murky!
Oh, ok, murder, cancer, soccer teams eating each other in the Andes.
No, only the three of you, any more than that and she'll get suspicious.
Hey.
Hey.
Yes, hi, Mr. Adelman. Thanks for meeting me.
Hmm, pulling in a salary in the high six figures or rubbing gross naked people for chump change-ooh, what do I do?! What will I do?!
What are you doing?!! Why are you defending him?! Just get me another doctor! One who is not crazy and who is not Fonzie!
Oh, I can still do that.
Honey, you've got to go. What's his office number?
Hey, what's going on?
I don't know! I didn't come with her!
Oh, is that who the monkey's named after?
So?
What? You mean behind my back?
Hey.
Oh yeah, it'll be fun.
More bandages! More bandages! Please, can I get some more bandages in here! This man is dying- Oh no.
Come on, it's not that big a deal!
Uh, I don't think so!
Of course! Yeah, I was uh, umm Thigh Mega Tampon.
Oh my God, they took my idea!
Oh, it's not!
Can I tell you a little secret?
Anyway, OK, now promise you won't like, freak out and say how great this is until I'm done, OK.
Ooh! That's so nice...
Uh-hmm.
Oh, no.
No.
Well, maybe 25-26.
Well, if you don't know I can't help you.
No, that would be, "Why are you being cute?"
Oh, yeah! You like 'em? I just, I went to a used clothes store and got a bunch of maternity stuff. These are sooo comfortable!
Excuse me, is this your car?
Right. My name was on there, but now it just says "carrot cake". So, um, so um, how many chords do you know?
Yeah? Are you sure, really.
Yeah, well, everybody does! I'm a really cool person. And y'know you had 29 years to find that out, but you didn't even try! Y'know what, you walked out on me, and I'm just, I'm gonna do the same thing to you.
I don't know. I mean, she obviously has some kind of unfinished business. Sit up!
What about me? I just found out that Denise is leaving town for a while, I don't have a roommate.
Oh, okay.
Hey, Frank. Look, okay, I know that you think I did like this totally evil thing, but I so didn't. There's someone here who can explain this better than I can.
OK, OK, don't get all squinky.
You know her?!
But, it's not like we're losing anything. Y'know?
Hey! Check it out! This is unbelievable! Joey has been holding his breath for almost four minutes!
Hey!
After he passed out, we put the sand around him to keep him warm.
A stripper at a bachelor party, that is so clich. Why don't you get a magician?!
You wanna try it again?
What?
Oh, okay. Well, so tell me everything about my parents. Everything.
Or, we could not tell them we know and have a little fun of our own
Oh my God! Monica's just gonna kill you.
Ewww! And "Oh no!" It's-they just want me to be the surrogate. It's her-it's her egg and her sperm, and I'm-I'm just the oven, it's totally their bun.
Yeah! What are you saying?
This is so typical. I'm always the last one to know everything.
No way! No way! You just broke with Tag a week ago.
Oh, I'll get it.
No, nothing like that. I was just...such a dummie. I taught this "massage-yourself-at-home-workshop." And they are.
No-no-no! We haven't started yet. Where's Alice?
Obviously I didn't think they were gonna start throwing things. I just thought if I kept insulting everyone, you would jump in and defend everyone and then you could look like the hero.
Hey.
Stilts?
Oh no.
...Then I've already seen this one!
What do you know?!
Okay, so after this audition, who decides who gets it?
Yes, I will tell her.
Sing!!
Listen, Robert's gonna be here any second so, will one of you just tell him?
Okay! Thanks! Happy Holidays, here's your joy.
I'm sorry, but sometimes they need help. That's fine. Go ahead and scoff. You know, there're a lot of things that I don't believe in, but that doesn't mean they're not true.
Oh, in that case--Yay! That was me hopping on board.
Ohh, okay, they gave you the old time pricing.
We're so stupid! Do you know what's going on in there? They're trying to take Joey!
That fan kinda looks like ours. And the birdcage and the...wait a sec! This is our exact living room!
Hey!
Huh?
Oh.
Yeah! And if you wanna look 19, then you... You gotta do something about your eyes.
Now... "Who will perform the ceremony! Who will perform the cer--Oh-oh! All right, I'll pound on him in the morning.
Oh, no, I have the cutest Christmas story!
Ohh! I did not get that.
Well then, what about you?! Huh?!
I'm not done yet, OK. God. OK, if that goes well, they may even want to make an album.
I'll give you $1 for them.
I sang. Hah!
Thanks! Y'know, that when you say things like that it makes me wanna rip that sweater vest right off!
I am definitely gonna watch that!
I don't have time for this.
Nope.
I'll get it.
Thanks a lot! I just got that jerk out of my mind!
Does Joey know?
Ya know, in all the years that we have been grandmother and granddaughter, you have never lied to me.
Me too! Oh! Did you ever see An Officer and a Gentleman?
Yeah. So um, did he ever talk about me, Phoebe?
No, I know what a silent is I meant, what's going on with your hair?
Well, I'm ready to get the hell out of here! Oh. Are you? Are you?!! Ohh! That's so great!! Ooh, not for Bonnie. But for you, yay! Ohh.
Oh, it's your audition from this morning. Can I use the phone again?
Wow! You really go all out when you're expecting company.
No! I do want to!
I don't know. I don't know. I can't lie to him again. Oh no I-no! I'm just gonna press my breasts up against him.
Okay, thank you, Mr. Heckles.
There it is!
Whatever.
Uh-huh, great story! I'm going!
What happened?
Because you're marrying him!
Umm, wow. This-this isn't gonna be easy. Umm, I don't think we should see each other anymore.
Nu-uh!
Oh wait! That can't be the one Rachel's talking about. She didn't even know that happened. So which one was it?
He said that, um, he understands how sex can be like, a very emotional thing for a woman and he was just afraid that I was gonna get all, y'know, like, 'ohh, is he gonna call me the next day' and, y'know, 'where is this going' and, ya know, blah-la-la-la-la. So he said he wanted to hold off until he was prepared to be really serious.
What?! That's the first time today!
No, 'cause he's yummy.
Ewwww!!
What the hell is this?! What, did you actually thought it would make me feel better to give me stuff that I can't use for another two months?! This sucks! All right, what's my next present?!
Ok, who wants to hear something ironic?
Are you still mad at us?
Okay, we're on it. We're on it.
Oh, God, just do it! Call her! Stop being so testosteroney!
Hey.
What makes it pilgrim?
Much as you are.
I know but it's so hard! Nothing rhymes with your stupid name!
So he's probably really nervous around women, y'know? Maybe, you just have to make the first move.
You're right! You're right. Don't say it.
Yeah, I understand.
Hey! Ross!
All right. I'll do it, I kissed him before I can do it again.
I'm so jealous you're all going! I can't believe I never knew that you can't fly in your third trimester!
So, here you are. It seems like yesterday I was talking to you in that little petri dish. Everyone said labor was the hardest thing I'd ever have to do, but they were wrong this is. Oh, I had the most fun with you guys! I wish I could take you home and see you everyday. Okay, I'll settle for being your favorite Aunt. I know Alice's sister has a pool, but you lived in me. Okay, so we're cool. Yeah, we're gonna be great. Little high fives! Ahh! Ahh! Ahh! Well, if you're gonna cry.
God! Ooh! What is that smell? It's coming from the bathroom. Ooh!
Because it's Arabian princess day at work! Okay?! Leave me alone!
So good!
What's that smell?
Yeah?
No, just a barrel.
So Monica, what were you gonna tell us?
Oh!
Well you obviously didn't see Chucky 3.
Oh good! Okay. 'Cause you were acting like you didn't.
No, no maybe 'cause it's harder to raise them, and the added expense, and...
You can still sleep at night and stuff.
Why, do I have a feeling that's not as happy as it sounds? No! Nooooo!!!
Great!
Well my guy is spectacular. Okay? He's a massage client and one time umm, when he was on the table, I looked at it. And I mean all of it.
Hey.
I'm in.
OK, Rachel, why don't you start talking first.
Ok, Love Story, Brian's Song, and Terms of Endearment.
Wait! Wait! Hi! Listen, Ross can I just talk to you for just a second?
Yeah, I agree. Ya know, I think fancy parties are only fun if you're fancy on the inside and I'm just not sure we are.
Personal shopping? What is that? Like where you walk around with snooty rich people and tell them what to buy?
Now, are you sure you don't want to go see a doctor?
Yeah. Not looking for dates.
Oh, yeah. Ok, thank you.
On your dresser.
No! No, the robots just work for them.
Well, she's out of town so, there's gotta be something in her house that tells me where my Father is.
And the big one's for me!
So go fix it! Go find Chandler! He's probably up in your room! Tell him that you're sorry and that you love him.
Wow! That is a bad audition.
Hey!
Oh, check it out, oh check it out. It's Smelly Cat the video.
Just calm down woman!
I really thought you making a good point. I mean y'know, until you got cut off.
All right. Good luck.
Okay, I wanna be sexy again so I'm trying to catch a cold. It should be easy, supposedly they're pretty common.
Hey!
Oh.
I-I can't find anything that I want to eat! Everything I eat makes me nauseous! I'm telling you, being pregnant is no piece of cake-ooh! Cake! No.
Congratulations!
Yeah okay, no if it helps you okay. Yeah.
It's Monica's bed. What?
All right, I will. No, I will. But umm, y'know just remember that it's still really early, okay so, if it says that I'm not pregnant, that doesn't mean that I'm not gonna get pregnant, okay and, and just please, just so I don't go completely nuts, just try not put all your hopes on this.
See? This is exactly why you shouldn't lie!
Yeah, her first day on a new spiritual plane and she's gonna come to the coffeehouse!
Well, who cares what your Mom thinks? So you pulled a Monica.
Because at that time you see, I thought everything that rhymed was true. So I thought y'know that if I'd work with stocks, I'd have to live in a box, and only eat lox, and have a pet fox.
Oh no, don't hate, you don't want to put that out into the universe.
Yeah and yeah, and it would probably be better than the last telephone job I had. Y'know, I probably wouldn't have to say spank as much.
You cook naked?
This is nice. We never do anything just the two of us.
OK, so, you know what you're doing, right?
Okay.
Ross, how many parents have you lost?
I love Jacques Cousteau!
What about this?
Just kidding!
Yeah, and you have nothing to worry about 'cos they're all crap!
Did I miss it, did I miss it?
Hi, so what happened?
If!
Surprise! Look who's back!
Yeah!
Hi.
But at least the apothecary table is real.
With what?
No, but let's come back to that later!
Ok, all right. We want to hear everything. Monica, get the wine and unplug the phone. Rachel, does this end well or do we need to get tissues?
The little jail between the doors!
Well, it's a problem for me, which means it's a problem for you 'cause I'm a cop.
Alright. I looked all over the building and I couldn't find the kitty anywhere.
Now I know that they said that the umm, the hair straightener started the fire but I think I'm partly at fault. You see, I didn't, I didn't tell you but umm, but I-I had recently refilled the tissues and so y'know let's just face it, that's just kindling! So I think it's better that I stay at Joey's.
Yeah?
Ah!
I don't know what to do with that.
Ooh, ok, that's it. Enough with the keys. No one say keys.
Okay bye.
W-w-I just-it's that-I have-y'know I have-I have an appointment. And it's very important.
Whatcha doin'?
Ohh! Okay, I'm going to have to kick her ass too.
I think he's right. You guys hang out at the coffeehouse way too much.
Hey, dude!
Oh, I hate this. Everything's changing.
No..umm, could I talk to one of them? It's very very important.
No, I know, I know, that this is Frank's life, y'know. Y'know, I don't want to be all judgmental, y'know, but this is sick, it's sick and wrong!
Finger sandwiches and tea.
Well, I mean, then what happens if it doesn't work out?
Almost never.
Ow!!!
Fish!
I hope it's you.
See? I'm doing it. I am totally doing it. I lost it.
Oh, I'm still mad at them but I also now that they bring happiness to lots of kids who's moms didn't kill themselves, so by supporting them, I'm doing a good thing, but I'm not happy about it. So there, a selfless good deed.
Yeah. But Sergei said it took the Germans six weeks to get all the way across it.
Okay, so what do you think ladies? Who wouldn't be interested? Who wouldn't want to date him?
Bye!
Thousands of times!! That doesn't make me sound too good does it?
What?
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!! Hey!!! Look what you're doing to Chandler!! Yeah, look, we know this is really, really hard for you guys. Okay? You don't, all right you don't have to love each other, okay? You don't, you don't even have to like each other much right now. But please, you have to figure out a way to be around each other.
Okay.
They were threefold.
Yeah, totally!
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
I know, the babies are asleep.
Didn't it like totally speak to you?
How are you? Good. Hi, thanks for coming.
Show me the badge again.
Yeah, think so. Oh! Huh. Whoah.
CHANDLER AND MONICA!!!!
She's already fluffed that pillow... Monica, you know, you've already fluffed that- -but, it's fine!
Okay!
Hey. Here. Ohh, who's the silver fox?
Yeah, but did you see the dents in his knuckles? That means he's artistic.
I really don't want to mess up what we have. I'm just-I'm worried it's gonna be a big mistake.
Not a good day for birds...
Uh-huh, and a little seed money for the party.
Give me your hands. Strings. Gimme it! Pick. Do you want to learn to play guitar?
Any luck?
That is.
We've got the ground-up flesh of formerly cute cows and turkeys, ew...
You should! How is she?
I'm just helping the kids!
And! She uses sex as a weapon!
Hey-ooh so, how was Vermont?
Well, they fired me and I'm having heart attack.
Okay! Okay! Okay!
Yeah.
Nope. Zilch, nothin', uh-uh.
Yeah!
Well, it helps the bee look tough in front of his bee friends. The bee is happy and I am definitely not.
I'm a lady Monica, I don't kiss and tell. But this hickey speaks for itself.
Oh, c'mon, like you tell me everything.
Oh, OK, I don't eat meat.
Thank you.
Whe-where did he put it?!
Guess what. Frank Jr., and Alice got married!
Yeah. We don't speak. She's like this high-powered, driven career type.
Ooh that is definitely Chandler, Joey, or Ross. Or-or Rachel!
No. I'm-I'm to depressed to talk.
Oh.
Oh! Yeah, y'know you and Ross are still married.
Open bar?
Aww, and good luck to you too! What a nice lady!
You're thing. You're thing. Y'know? You're the guy who gets divorced.
Oh, okay.
Oh my God! You got off easy! When my friend Silvie's husband said someone else's name in bed, she cursed him and turned his thingy green.
Yes. Once. Yeah, a little. He kinda did it to himself. It's not really a good story.
You guys. I'm sorry about your shopping.
Rachel Karen Green, where's the other earring?!
Hi! Oh yeah, uh-huh, it's me. I saw you grab your running shoes this morning and sneak out. You lied so you could run by yourself.
Yes! A friend of mine did it and it's totally legal!
Chandler, I-I will handle this! How much is it?
Oh-oh, that's your thing.
Yeah! Here! Oh no, these are the trick deck. Okay. Here yes. Okay.
I'm still on "no."
Yeah it is! It is! It's freshwater eel!
Sur-surprise.
Okay, London 1...
Uh-huh. Oh, yeah, I could write about the time my hair did that "Woo-hoo" thing.
Oh yeah, I totally agree.
I don't know, I mean, he's a good person, and he can be really sweet, and in some ways I think he is so right for me, it's just... I hate that guy!
Oh no, it is forbidden! No-no, Mrs. Potter fires people for fooling around with clients. And it's against my oath as a masseuse.
Okay, you know where you are better than I do. I was just curious.
Ohhh... Sure, yeah... ..okay, it fits.
Well, tell him, apology accepted.
Thank you, Happy Holidays.
I love the license plate game!
Yeah!
God, that is the nicest kitchen.
No!
Not that often!
Oh! And, he's the kinda guy who, when you're talking, he's listening, y'know, and not saying 'Yeah, I understand' but really wondering what you look like naked.
Yeah!
Alright. So um, stilts huh?
Okay! It's worth it, if it will get you moving. You haven't worked in months.
Ooh, you nailed the Old Lady!
Yeah, I can see where I'd be your best shot but, no. I'm sorry, but I think it's twisted.
Look at you! How, how do you feel?
Oh and they're gonna have a baby.
Just for a second.
Ross, where did you get this?!
I just went to my old apartment to get you the-the cookie recipe and the stupid fire burned it up!
I might have.
Oh, yeah! Okay! Great! Go, man, go put on your shoes, and, and march out there and meet her! Oh, wait, no, no you have to take a shower, 'cause, eww. No, you know what you have to answer her, answer her first. No, no, you know what make some coffee 'cause its too much.
'Right, well look, um, if Joey loses this audition, that is it for Estelle. I don't care! Annie you are a doll, what time can you see him?' I need a pen.
Hey everybody, Rachel was so good today. She didn't gossip at all.
Wait, wait, why were you at the courthouse?
Two.
You know, I think I want to write a song about all this.
You just can't stand anyone else enjoying themselves can't you?
Okay, umm, it's this tragic love story between Cathy and Heathcliff and umm, it takes place on like these really creepy mores in England. Which I think represents the wildness of Heathcliff's character. I totally get symbolism.
He said, "Nice to meet you Glenda." Well, obviously I couldn't give him my real name?
Butterscotch? No one? All right, you'll be sorry later.
Ooh.
Okay, don't worry, I'm just checking to see if the muscle's in spasm...huh.
I'm in.
Nothing, nothing.
He's alive! He's a-live!!!
No no no, doggie please. Oh, I do so wanna love all animals, please no.
Always.
What are you wrapping?
Okay, I think I need to do some shopping.
So, Scott asked me to come over for lunch today and I did.
It's not in the apartment? Oh no. I can't believe this is happening again.
Let's see!
Sure! Where is it?
Hmmm? Yeah. So, um, is she fat?
Oh no, yeah.
Uh-huh, well! But umm, still I'm-I'm mad at you.
I ate a bug.
I'm sorry, Monica, I'm really happy you got promoted, but cold cucumber mush for thirty-something bucks? No! Rachel just had that, that, that salad, and, and Joey with his like teeny pizza! It's just...
Oh hey! How was your audition?
She was?
Oh no.
Yeah, I think we are.
Rachel.
Hey! Ooh, wow that jacket looks great on you!
Ok, have a good break-up.
Well, it seems like there weren't any tears 'til you showed her the bill.
That's too hard. Too hard!
Ohh, yes it would.
Yeah, I know, he's sweet, but it's just not fun anymore, you know? I don't know if it's me, or his hunger strike, or, I don't know.
Why? Just 'cause you're too lazy to get up off your touchie?
I can't believe this!
I know.
Ohh! So you're 5639?!
No!
Hey!
I know! I know! I know!
Oh, because, you know... they don't like you.
Happy Holidays. Feliz Navidad. Allo, and Merry Christmas. Ohh thank you sir. Here's some joy.
No-no, that's not, that's not me Phoebe, that's her pal Phoebe. According to her high school yearbook, they were like B.F.F. Best Friends Forever.
Okay then.
No it isn't, this is my dad, alright, I'll show you.
Well, didn't you just hear what I said?!
Yeah, she came all the way back from Ross' building. Oh, the things she must have seen! And then she climbed up the fire escape and she tapped on the window with her teeny little paw and then we ran to let her in... I went to far, didn't I? When should I have stopped?
Hey! I've got a great idea for party favors for the shower. Okay, we get some uh mahogany boxes and carve everyone's names in them and inside is everyone's individual birth stone.
Bye, Gene.
Oh, well, it doesn't have a name-oh, okay, Phoebeball! No, it doesn't have a name. Umm, okay, Monica, what is your favourite thing about trees?
Yeah, look I was with my friend downstairs and we hear everything up here that you do, and I am sick and tired... .
Okay, thanks. Yeah, I'll try that.
My God! What did you order?!
Oh okay, well I'm sorry to bother you. Bye-bye. Yeah you're right, this is easy.
Terry's a jerk, and he won't let me work, and I hate Central Perk!
Okay. All right. Good luck explaining all the calls to China.
Yeah, otherwise, I mean that's, that's, that's just it for us hanging out together. Y'know is that what you want? Can you be civil?
What's with all the bottles of liquor?
That won't go with this dress though.
They give you away! There's just-there's just too much wisdom in there. Just put some tea bags on there for like 15 minutes.
Oh! Ooh! Oh, I didn't know that you did...pot.
Um, not even a little bit.
Why? Because she can sing and play guitar and do both at the same time?
Who's singing?
Ohh. Um-hmm. But y'know, she choose to find me. I mean, I have to respect her decision. Right?
Okay. I'd- just- I'd never be able to enjoy it. It would be like this giant karmic debt.
Oh. What's a lurker?
See, he's her lobster.
Ok. We can, um, we can burn the stuff they gave us.
I'm just saying, get his number just in case. But no Chandler is in an accident and can't perform sexually and he would want you to take a lover to satisfy the needs that he can no longer fulfill.
Ooh, this is it, 74.
This stuff is great!
I will find a selfless good deed! 'Cause I just gave birth to three children and I will not let them be raised in a world where Joey is right!
Hey, hey, ok, all right, that's it! Get in here. Come on. My god, you guys, I don't believe you. There are children coming into the world in this very building and your negative fighting noises are not the first thing they should be hearing. So just stop all the yelling, just stop it!
Okay, I would ring the bell to distract him and then I would knock the gun out of his hand with a Chinese throwing star.
Well, I snapped! Okay? You weren't taking the class seriously.
Well just figure out a way to talk him out of it.
Ohh, you and your ways. Since it's Christmastime. I'm going to be one of those people collection donations.
Okay, but try and get Joey too.
Works on you.
Oh, just go. You're never gonna get it!
Come on Ross, you're a paleontologist, dig a little deeper.
Yeah. Oh, can I come?
... with the double double double-jointed boy. Hey. So um, are you the professional guitar player?
Oh. Okay. Oo, sorry I acted like a bank.
So what's going on?
Oh, my, oh!
No! It's nice!
Rachel said that!
It's mostly just photographs of lesbian love scenes interspersed with video games and free sandwiches.
Ohhh. Thanks Chandler they're great!
Hey.
Well okay, let this be a lesson to all of you, all right. Once you, once you betray me, I become like the ice woman, y'know. Very cold, hard, unyielding, y'know nothing, nothing can penetrate this icy exterior. Can I have a tissue, please?
Hi.
Nooo! Why would you think that?
Oh, I wanna see! Lemme see! Lemme see!
Ohh, you are so lucky! Hey! So, where's Monica? Did you guys make up?
Hey. Oh thanks for the great movie tip.
Central... Park!
My guy is well read.
What, what is that?
Hey!
Joey? What's going on?
Um, well, Max told me about Minsk, so congratulations! This is so exciting!
I picked her! Oh thank God you want her! Ooh!
Hey you guys, look, the one-eyed jack follows me wherever I go. Right, OK, serious poker.
Ohh. No that's okay, he's a friend.
Umm, I think you're really, really great...
What's the matter?
If she's no fun, why do you want to date her at all?
Ah-ha! Too cocky!
Yeah, uh-huh, a 100 dollars.
Okay. Wait, do you know how you're going to stall her?
Yes!! Yes! Yes! Yes!! That's my Dad, that's Frank! Yeah! I'm sorry I'm getting all flingy.
No-no-no, but I am mad! I am mad! Because this stuff is everything that is wrong with the world! And it's all sitting up in my living room and all I can think about is how I don't have that lamp!
Hey.
Hi.
You're kinda stepping on the song.
Uh, here. What time?
Well, because we thought you knew!! It's so obvious! God, that would be like telling Monica, "Hey, you like things clean." Or, y'know, "Hey, Joey, you're gay."
Ah! Well! There you go! Last to know again! And I'm guessing... since nobody told me... this is Paolo.
You guuuyys.
Well, I-I thought a lot about what you said, and um, I realilized duh, all right maybe I was a little judgmental. Yeah, oh, but oh...
Okay.
Yes!
What?! Oh my... Oh my God!! What happened?!
Can you believe this. In, like, two hours I'm gonna have a dad. Eeeshk.
All right, betting and wagering of any kind, are, I'm sure, not permitted in the happy place. Okay. Just-just, you know, the-the lovely waterfalls, and the, the trickling fountains. And the-the calming sounds of the babbling brook....
This is my father, this is a picture of my dad.
Oh. Y'know, he hums while he does other stuff to.
Oh Joey, we've heard the specials three times! Okay? There's prime rib, mahi mahi, and a very special lobster ravioli.
Ooh, I love that place! So, no.
You ate meat! You had sex!
Ohh, ok, I see what you did there. Aren't you afraid though, that the writers are gonna be kinda mad when they read this?
Ohh knockers will help us figure it out.
Living with you would make me happy.
Why couldn't you have just figured this out six years ago?
It's okay. What the hell took you so long?
Yep, and that's why we don't invite you to play.
Wow! My breasts are really strong.
Isn't there a national football league.
Oh OK. So, um, the cat stinks but you love it, let's go.
Because you would rather live here with Joey.
Y'know you, you just stop being such a wuss and get those off and you come with us and watch naked girls dance around!!
Are you calling me selfish?!
Yeah, big guy, kinda bald.
Oh, hello, kettle? This is Monica. You're black.
Oh, let me see!
Fine! Okay, all right, so Jane Eyre, first of all, you'd think she's a woman, but she's not. She's a cyborg.
Well, how about a compromise then, okay? What if it's like y'know, Chanoey?
Yeah well, we'll see.
I just-I thought you guys were doing it, I didn't know you were in love!
Oh, if I were, would-would I have shooting pains up and down my left arm?
You guys, we said we were gonna have fun! Come on, hey, remember the time... You don't remember?
Watch this.
Oh my God! Oh my God, we are 31.
No listen to me! She is crazy!
My sticky shoes, my sticky-sticky shoes, why do you stick on me, ba-a-by! Thanks for the lights honey.
But then we ditch those two and that's when we get married. We'll have Chandler's money and Rachel's kids and getting custody will be easy because of Rachel's drinking problem.
So... What's the deal with umm, you and Joey?
Oh!! That's my new thing. I figure bodies at peace, make peace.
I can't. I can't believe I have plans, I can't. Can you do it tomorrow night though?
Hey.
Okay, yeah well, good news, you're going to have three babies.
Okay, I will find someplace else to do the rest of my appointments. I just don't know what the big deal is!
OK.
Oh hey, Monica, I heard you saw Donald Trump at your convention.
I'm just saying, this woman, I mean she's fictitious. No?
I don't believe this. Is this how this relationship's gonna work? Ross equals boss. I mean, c'mon what is this, 1922?
Yeah well, she certainly knew what she was doing New Year's Eve 1997.
How about we talk about this over dinner?
What?! I thought you were crazy about her!
What do you mean?
Hey.
No!
Hugh! Hugh Grant!
Ok, you can do this. It's just like pulling off a Band-aid. Just do it really fast, and then the wound is exposed.
Monica, I'm sorry I didn't come by last night. I was out with Gary; he let me ride around with him in his cop car. We saw and prevented crimes.
So have you decided on a band for the wedding? Because, y'know, I'm kinda musical.
Now if you want to receive e-mails about my upcoming shows, then please give me money so I can buy a computer.
YOU KNOW?!!!
Cool Aunt Phoebe. I am pretty cool!
Rachel.
Yeah, thanks. And listen, can you do me a favor? Could you just umm, wake me up in a couple hours, y'know if you can.
Better. Yeah.
Ooh, where are you off to, Travelin' Jake?
Oh no! No God, definitely not jealous!
Umm, okay I would like to talk to you about your toner needs.
That's a defense?
Okay. Ooh, y'know we could just do this.
Hey, you know what might help you deal with it? Think of it this way, you and Emily are in the past and you can't be mad about the past. So are you still mad about the Louisiana Purchase?
Based on this play? ...Based on this play!
Like a date type person?
So that's what you thought I did!! God! That's not what I do!
But I can't tell you.
Give her a break, it's hard being on your own for the first time.
Ameri-can. Y'know it's a very hard language. Let's do it again.
That's right, I don't... But I was, I was drunk on you!
Unless! She wants to spend the night holding my hair back for me.
Oh my God! How bad was it?
Hey!
Um you, you got a minute?
Well, do you see any babies?
Oh, me too!
Yummy noises.
Yeah but why didn't you just say that you didn't read the book?!
Yeah, we all know! We talk about it all the time!
I've found....
Hey! Hi!
I'm pretty sure it's gun.
All right, c'mere, gimme your feet.
No, no, you can get one yourself. It'll be on the house! Y'know what are big sisters for?
I... I cannot believe Ross even made this list. What a dinkus.
Hey, why don't you?
Oh, wait, let me get you another glass. That's been sitting out.
Ohh! No.
Hey!
Both of you together?
Yeah, I really liked that fighter pilot one.
Ooh! Oh!
What?!
Yes you do! This is your third divorce! You love divorce so much you're probably gonna marry it! Then it won't work out and you're gonna have to divorce it, divorcing guy. I'm so drunk.
Ooh! That's Good! Wow! But Now If You Were Pregnant, What Would You Name It? Hint Phoebe.
Come on, do it.
Oh God, I really missed that fat bastard!
Noooo!!
So how's your date with your cyberchick going. Ooh, hey, what is all that .
Just for the future, this is hardly a commercial for it.
I already had a baby. Leave me alone.
I don't have it!
Ooh, I think I wanna trade circles.
I would, but I get my morning sickness in the evening.
What's the big deal, y'know? It's not like it's a real marriage.
Because the more I drink, the less there is for the kids to drink.
Shh! Doogie, shh! Doesn't anybody understand that I'm gonna be having babies soon? Huh? Go! Go little boy, go!
He seems to hate you. Are you sure?
Oh, it's my fault?! You didn't have to massage him! You could've sent him away! You could've not rolled Tonka trucks up and down his back!
Hey!
Coming through! Oh! Coming through! Oh! Hello! Hi! No! Right! Coming through!
Oh no, I am mad at you. I know that much. But, I am sorry about the fat ass thing. You actually have a very sweet little hiney.
Oh no, Ross doesn't know anything.
Okay, well umm, I know that we haven't talked in a long time, but umm okay, our Mom is not our birth Mom. This-this other lady is our birth Mom.
I don't know.
Hi! Wish me luck!
Oh come on, they can be in the same room.
Oh my God!! The baby just kicked!
Monica, Monica, you know what gets out hummus.
Okay, you said I could sing at your wedding so, I'm just gonna need a small deposit.
I don't know, I hardly ever say that about people.
No!
Yeah! Ooh, you should come with me! Oh yeah, then I'd have someone to sit with!
Maybe nobody's tried this.
Okay. Then, take the tiara back and let me hold the musket again. Something's missing. It's not... Okay oh, let me see the ring my friend picked out.
Hey! Rachel! Come on!!!!
Monica, leave him alone!
What does that mean? Does he sell it, drink it, or just complain a lot?
Ewwww!!
Hi.
Oh my God!
OK, now I'm gonna kick some ass.
Or maybe he-he was writing to tell her that-that he's changed his name, y'know? Tell Monica I'm sorry.
Ooh, Atlantic City! Oh, that's a great plan! Who's plan was that?
Oh, somewhere Joey's head is exploding.
Wow, that's close. When's yours?
All right, wait! Just wait. Everybody just calm down. Okay? Let's give our friend Joey a chance to explain why he's such a big pervert!
Don't worry about me, I'm a robot! I'm just a machine!!
There you go.
Okay.
Oh God, I'm so glad you guys are happy, I was so afraid you were going to be all freaked.
Oh, look! Look! Look!
He just got a divorce right?
Oh, fine! Take his side!
Oh, ok, you know what I don't get? The way guys can do so many mean things, and then not even care.
What?
No, I really wanna live with you! I wanna move in with you!
Right, and its me.
I know, I just want to bite his bottom lip. But I won't.
Oh, okay. Listen, thanks for everything, Mon.
And a small piece of chocolate.
So you do know who he is! Sorry.
Um, I'm gonna have a cup of the cucumber soup, and, um, take care.
Umm, this stuffing is amazing. Do you think we should bring them some?
Okay. I have just a few questions to ask so I'm going to get out my official forms. Okay, so, question 1) You and uh, you were married to Francis' daughter Lilly, is that correct?
Ooh, it's sympathy pains. Ohh, that's so sweet!
It's a...tarantula! Oh! God! Rachel, look, I'm sorry. What was I thinking giving Joey this big, gross, scary spider in such a poorly constructed cage?
Maybe, because you told him not to.
No. You are the boss of you. Now you march your heinie in there and get that heart tattooed on your hip. GO!!
Listen to this! My reading was wrong, I'm not going die!
I don't know. You could tie her up, she could tie you up; you could eat stuff off each other...
Oh, you say someone's name enough, they turn around.
Ohh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. You'll get your turn!
I can't believe I'm gonna have a party! This is so great! A party! Yay!! I don't know why.
Oh my God, that's so freaky! Turn him off!!
Okay. Oh! Oh no.
Chandler?
Huh?
Thank you Rachel but, look at Monica!
What?
Yeah, I do, yeah.
It's too soon to tell. She's resting, which is a good sign.
Of course!
Okay, she would love that! Y'know, 'cause you know all the clean places to eat.
Please, don't play the music. Just uh one more. LIVE FROM NEW YORK! IT'S SATURDAY NIGHT!!
Say we are unagi!
Hm?
I've never been more convinced of your love for her.
Mmmmmm! Everything smells so delicious! You know, I can't remember a time I smelt such a delicious combination of of, OK, smells.
Hey, is Chandler here?
Yeah.
Yeah?
The little ones do.
It's not that bad.
No, no, I am against innocent trees being cut down in their prime, and their, their corpses grotesquely dressed in like tinsel and twinkly lights. Hey, how do you sleep at night?
Oh my God, he's not even appreciated in his own time. I would give anything to not be appreciated in my own time!
Oh no, the Mendels, they hate all living things, right?
Oh, they're just gonna umm, look to see if my endometria layer is thick.
That game should not be played without my supervision.
Wait a minute. What's his name?
How'd you know I was coming?
Sorry, I'm so sorry, I will pay you back.
No. This whole like playing-for-money thing is so not good for me. You know, I don't know, when I sang "Su-Su-Suicide", I got a dollar seventy-five. But then, "Smelly Cat", I got 25 cents and a condom. So you know, now I just feel really bad for Smelly Cat.
It's James Bond.
You guys are here! Yay!
Oh sure! Noo!
And y'know, even if they break up again, you'd better not let him in your sad men's club!
Ugh! No! This is so hard! I went through this whole book and found nothing! I want a name that's really like, y'know strong and confident, y'know? Like-like Exxon.
Uh huh. But they're not your friends anymore.
Oh? And how will you know what time to come over?
Watch, watch.
I know, you must've won like a contest or something!
Hey.
All right, so, what are we supposed to call you?
I don't want to hear about her!!
And maybe I could teach Ben about the Christmas skull and how people die.
No! No! Look at that! It's a line of ants! They're working as a team!
Shhh! I'm on a call! Umm well yeah, you can pick it up tonight, say 8:30? At-at my apartment. It's umm, it's umm 5 Morton Street, Apartment 14, umm and then maybe y'know after we can grab a bite to eat or whatever. Okay, well okay I'll see you then. Bye.
Great! Thank you very much.
Whoo-hoo!
Oh you're my biggest fan? I've always wanted to meet you! Hi! Sure! Yeah!
Okay, whatever. Y'know what? I don't have time have time to convince you because he's only here for four hours, and I'm gonna go see him!
All right. We're gonna take Clunkers to Ross's. We'll be back in a minute.
Yeah, I actually don't know...
Really?!
Oooh. Oh, well this is awkward.
Ross, could we please, please, please listen to anything else?
I can't, I have to take my grandmother to the vet.
Oh whoa-whoa-whoa! Wait a minute, open up your hand; let me take a look. Quarter. Dime. Lint? Not interested in that. What's this? A Canadian coin? Get outta here!
I'm so embarrassed, I'm the one he hit on!
Yeah, but you kinda knew that something was going on, didn't you?
OOooooo!
You guys make a very attractive couple.
So when, when do you leave?
Now, have you told anyone else?
No. What do you, what do you want me to be, like some stupid, big, like, purple dinosaur?
Oh no, none of them are the father. The father is my brother.
Oh. Well umm, okay here's a weird thing. My mother was also a supply manager.
Oh. Well is she, is she the first that you've been with?
What?
I don't even have a 'pl'.
Yep!
Yeah, y'know, people can be so self-involved.
Yeah! Why would my mother send me a fur? Doesn't she know me but at all! Plus, I have a perfectly fine coat that no innocent animal suffered to make!
Wait! Maybe, maybe you're overreacting! You do that y'know.
Oh no! No-no! I understand the pain! Don't-don't hurt the puppy.
Fine.
All right, Joey, same question.
Wow! I would trade.
It only takes two heart attacks to finally make you see.../One of them won't do it, but the second one will set you free.../Tell all your hate and anger, it's time to say good-bye.../And that is just what I will do, soon as those bastards I work for die!/La, la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la......
Ohh.
I KNOW THAT!!! You have to stop her!! She's going to ruin the wedding!!
Okay, what about you? Wouldn't you want a date?
Ohh!! Ohh!! And I love you!
Oh, so, how are we doing?
Oh my God! I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Which one's Demi Moore?
OH!! MY EYES!!! MY EYES!!!!
All right, no, well I want to kill them to, but their boys, y'know how are we gonna beat three boys?
Oh, okay! "Would I go back to Allesandro's? Sure, but I'd have to order two meals, one for me and one for the guy pointing the gun to my head." Wow! You really laid into this place.
Well, I'll tell you Rachel Karen Green, I had plans with Joey tonight and he left me this note.
Because you are so afraid of commitment! You talk to him, make him scared like you! Make him a...man!
Okay umm, I'd also like to try on the tiara. Oh yeah. Okay. What do you think, too much?
I will tell you as soon as you thank me for writing my book.
Hey Joey, I just wanted to let you know that I found a selfless good deed. I just went down to the park and I let a bee sting me.
But she just came up here!
Yeah, Chandler why don't you take a walk? This doesn't concern you.
Ok, right there. That, that's the third sign today. Right there.
Lotsa things.
Cigarettes?!!
Oy!!
Okay, well y'know what, don't worry you guys, 'cause I'm-I'm gonna do this as many times as it takes to get it right.
Hey!
Yeah. Um... I'm out.
Oh my God! This is a six-hour pill! That's it! I'm out of the woods! Ohh! What a relief!
Why?
Why do you care?
He says, that he would cremate my fur coat for free if I umm, y'know, bring in the next person I know who dies.
Ooh, uh...
Yeah. Hard Ass and Wuss. We could fight crime!
What if the husband person is the wrong guy, and you are the right guy. I mean you don't get chances like this all the time, if you don't meet her now, you're gonna be kicking yourself when your 80, which is hard to do, and that's how you break a hip.
Oh, you're such a cheater!
Hi!
Well, one of you has to take the first step! And it should be you, because she's the one who's leaving. It's harder for her!
Would she?
No spark? Didn't you sleep together?
Why? Why would you wanna... do that? Why?
Alright, could I just ask you one question?
Oh, I wasn't talking about his karma.
No. Why?
Oh, yeah, sure. So, how was your day?
Ohh, ohh.
Hi!
Not that way! But the bike brought you a lot closer!
You didn't read this one either?!
You have the power to do that?
I'll have coffee.
Oh, which museum?
Listen if you wanna go, just go.
Yeah! Okay-ooh, but are you going to have time to read it?
You know, did you ride mopeds? 'Cause I've heard... ... oh, I see... it's not about that right now. OK.
Totally.
No! Coins hate me!
We just have to really, really, really, not let stuff like money get--is that a hickey?
Knock, knock, knock, knock, hi. Um, could you please tell Sergei that um, I was fascinated by what Boutros Boutros Gali said in the New York Times.
I did it! I took care of the babies all by myself!
That's fine, just don't bring it in my mouth.
Really?
I helped!
Oh, hi, Mrs. Waltham. I need to speak with ether one of the best men, or Ross's sister Monica.
Let's just say, I'm glad I'm not Chandler.
Umm, you might even say that she pulled a Monica. She doesn't know we switched it.
It's amazing! My headache is completely gone! What are those pills called?
It's not that bad.
So is it like art?
Well, what did he do?
Oh, I see.
Noo!
Hey.
Hey!
Cute naked guy is really starting to put on weight.
Hey!! Get your ass back here, Tribbiani!!
Hey oh, Rach wait! Do you want to go to a movie tonight?
Then why are you answering? Do you at least know what route we're on?
You apologize to the tree right now or I am calling for backup. Backup! Backup!!
You'll have a last kiss.
Okay... Okay.
Ooh-Ooh! I did it! I did it! I figured out a way to make money! I'm gonna open up my own massage place and Frank's gonna help me! And! We can work it around his schedule so he doesn't have to quit school!
Oh weird, Chandler just told us he's got a conference there!
Ooh, it's not a toy.
Undo it. Undo it. Undo it.
Well then you'd better hurry! The Angelica! Go! Go!
Well, if you think it will help.
Your boobs are fine. Look, I never should have said anything. Come here. Come here. Oh, can't make.... hands... meet....
From the nursery rhyme. 'There was a crooked man, Who had a crooked smile, Who lived in a shoe, For a... while...'
Yeah! You're such a great friend!
Oh yeah, that's over.
This is Patrick.
Well, 'cause then they'd be like my mom used to make them, you know, before she died.
Why not?
Woo-yay!!
Hey, you should really read that book you wrote. Wow! You saw the hat in the kitchen and knew that she'd have to go in there hatless to get it. You can have your own health inspector detective show!
Oh Joey, I'm so sorry. You want some of my breakfast?
OK. Smelly cat, smell-ly cat, what are they feeding you? Smelly cat OK, sorry. I'm just, I'm just not getting that everyone um, gets how smelly this cat acually is. I just think that maybe if we could talk about this, 'cause I need to feel that you really care about the cat.
Oh, hey!
Oh my God! Dizziness, nervousness, drowsiness, facial swelling, nausea, headache-Headache. Vomiting, stomach bleeding, liver damage! Now okay, I don't recall any of this coming up when you gave me these little death capsules! Oh I'm sorry, extra strength death capsules!
What are you gonna do?
Oh, ew!
I would love that job!
Hey!
What?!
Definitely not his mother.
Destiny.
Well this doesn't even smell like opium.
Okay. Oh umm, Chandler, Monica is looking for you.
Oh I just miss him so much!
Oh! The yuk! Ross, he's doing it again!
Yeah. I just need you to bring me some photos of Ross.
Okay, well they are a huge responsibility, especially at this age. They require constant care. They-they need just the right food, and lot's and lot's of love.
Okay, don't give me a reason to get mad, okay
I dunno, let's see! So, okay, I dreamt that we were gonna get married, and he left, becuz he had to go fight a fire. And, um, so okay, I went to a night club, and I saw him making out with a girl.
Helloo! Oh!
Hey, guys, you know what Larry would say? He would say, "See you ladle."
I think she took it pretty well. You know Paolo's over there right now, so...
What if I had taken that job at Merrill Lynch?
I don't-she said y'know that I'd have triplets! But she also said one of them would be black.
That's not Ralph Lauren. Sounds like him though.
Ahhh!! Chandler and Monica!! Chandler and Monica!!
Oh, I don't know. I mean it was fun one time.
Ooh, it's not bad.
Yes. Yes! Fine! I am someone! You want me to say it? I have doubts! I'm sorry!
Really?! Really?!
Hi Rob Dohnen.
No, I just heard when people live together, they split the cost of stamps. Don't they?
Would you relax? I know what I am doing. This is how he wears it.
Oh my God Ross!!
Well, what period is it from?
Sure.
Which proves that I never lie.
No, not Phoebe, Dr. Philange. Oh no! You have it too!
Rachel?
Chandler.
Hey!! The charity's on fire! Help! Oh good! Thank you, I need that. Whoa! What is that?! It's nine o'clock in the morning!
There we go.You know what, if we were in prison, you guys would be, like, my bitches.
Hey you guys I'm gonna go out and take a walk.
What?!
Hey!
Oh, I'm sorry. Is that annoying? And speaking about being selfish in bed, how's Whitney?
Guys, I'm happy too.
I-I like pizza!
Nice!
Ha-ha, it's not my baby, ha-ha-ha!
Well if we make it yesterday, woo-hoo! We're done!
Yeah. Yeah, I'll be alright.
No, Joey! You borrowed my cab; you have to drive it back.
All right, hold on! Okay, let's just all think.
Oh, I don't know, I don't know. I think that's a little weird, y'know? Vinyl.
Well...
Okay! All right, let's start with the handshake. Hi.
God, they thought they can mess with us! They're trying to mess with us?! They don't know that we know they know we know! Joey, you can't say anything!
Well I'm sorry, I thought you said it was okay.
So great. Oh, we took a nap today and my Mom fell asleep on my tummy and purred.
Okay, what is this? A stupid contest? Because we got a winner here!
Then yes that is what I'm having.
Gunther, kiss me.
I know, they're gonna be so happy together.
Oh don't do that.
Least of all you.
Yeah that's better than my way.
No it's not, sorry.
Aw! Hey, do you think that Susan person is her lover?
There he is!
Yeah, I did. I think it sounds y'know big sistery, y'know, 'Frank's always late.'
Oh, no umm, hi, that-that, you have to put that out, 'cause I'm pregnant.
Umm, no thank you.
Ok, and I have the, uh receipt for my dinner with Nokululu Oon Ah Ah.
Yeah, it's just so strange. I mean, she probably woke up today and thought, "ok, I'll have some breakfast, and then I'll take a little walk, and then I'll have my massage." Little did she know God was thinking, "Ok, but that's it." Oh, but the weirdest thing was, ok, I was cleansing her aura when she died, and when the spirit left her body, I don't think it went very far.
Okay, I'll be out in a second.
Five minutes ago, a line like that would've floored me. Now nothing. Well, not nothing, I am still a woman.
There was a pregnancy test in the garbage, and it's positive. Monica's pregnant. So I guess she won't be totally alone.
Can you believe this? We were waiting for a hot guy and then an even hotter one shows up!
Oh! No problem! I...
I don't what your talking about.
Oh sure, Cilantro Larry.
So uh, now look at the picture...
Okay, bye.
Okay.
Oh. Oooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! My butt cheek is waking up! Oooh! Ooh!
Oh God, Korea is such a beautiful country.
Oh, Rachel and I have appointments to get our hair cut.
A dollar?
Oh! Here it is! Ooh, Joey! Why did you sign it, "Son of a bitch?"
Uh huh, what is happening to the world? I mean, no no no, 'cause ET leaves, and and Rocky loses, Charlotte dies.
Yeah, after this, I think he'll be doing that himself.
Oh, they love your casserole.
YOU DID NOT!!!! Oh! No! You came up with Relaxi Cab! That's not good.
Ahhh!! Chandler and Monica!! Chandler and Monica!!
Okay.
No Chandler, they can swallow one of those little parts! And also, look at his smooth area, that's just gonna mess them up.
OK, I can be a waitress, I can be a waitress.
Yeah?
Yeah, I guess I do, yeah.
Oh OK. Oh no, oh it's gone, that's so weird, I don't know how-where it went.
Yeah, she was bald, she's not now.
Ok, yeah, ok. Oh, OK.
I'm not gonna lie to you, Ross, it doesn't look good. I put a clip on one side, which seems to have stopped the curling.
Really?
Okay, let's go running!
Stop it! Stop it! She keeps squirming, trying to get away! Just like when she was alive.
Ohh!
I saw it.
Ah-ha! Okay, Las Vegas 1, London 0! I'll be right back.
Who, Josh?
Vince is a fireman.
Well speaking of chiming in, remember the time you burned down my apartment?
Ooo, a crossword! Can I help?
Oh right, maybe I'll just go home.
Both!
Umm, well I had a similar problem when I lived in Prague.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Happy, happy Chanukah, Chandler and Monica. Very merry...
It's fun, God I love how sexy I am.
Could you-could you umm, give us one second?
Yeah? Okay, I think I'll play it at the wedding.
No.
Yeah that was lucrative! Smart like your brother!
Oh look! That guy's peeing!
Excuse me, but umm, isn't he paying for your dinner?
I'm sorry.
Hello?
Swear?!
No I'm not okay. The only guy I've ever been crazy about has gone to Minsk and I may never...I may never see him again.
You could get arrested, right now! All right, yeah, I gotta take it back. I'm totally drunk with power.
No! Barry and Mindy.
What a neat idea. All your clothes match. I'm gonna do this.
Really? You can actually see it?
Yes, Denise. Denise!
Hey hey hey! She's on!
You won't even taste it?
Ick-neck-tree-anis..... There's a 'g' in there.
Uh-huh, uh-huh.
Oh we can't, we already have plans.
Wow! I didn't see that coming! You're-you're asking me out!
Umm, thank you for meeting with me.
Um, perhaps. Yes! Yes, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I was just afraid that you were still hung up on my sister.
Yeah, but you've known Rachel since High School and you cannot just cut her out of your life.
That sounds great!
Oh my God! So was she! And! Get this, okay? Your-your name is Earl, right? Her name was Pearl, P-Earl.
Oh Rach, good, listen isn't this perfect for me!
Oh, I cursed it. So now bad things will happen to he who spends it.
Yeah, yeah I got that.
Yeah, I think it was better when you guys were sad. Hey, uh, remember the roller blades?
Oh God!
Oh, hi Ross!
I like our way. Oh! Chess!
Ah! Oh my God! You r-r-rotten boys!
No, but would you like a thousand dollars and a football phone?
Okay. There may be a way that we can get the other ring back. 'Cause I heard the guy tell the jeweler where he was going to propose. So maybe we can get him to trade rings or something.
Ooh! Bath salts would be nice.
Umm, yeah! Today's.
Joey, I can't believe you would do that for me.
Oh, yeah!
Ok, this is the most romantic disease I've ever had.
I think on some levels she already knows.
Wait!
Oh, I am sorry but I am incredibly talented.
Hey!
Well, 'cause, I mean, what if, what if he's not this great dad guy? I mean, what if, what if he's just still the dirtbag who ran out on my mom and us? You know what? I've already lost a fake dad this week and I don't think I'm ready to lose a real one.
Oops!
Yay me.
I made a man with eyes of coal And a smile so bewitchin', How was I supposed to know That my mom was dead in the kitchen? La lalala la la la la lalala la la...
No that made me feel precious.
Me too! So happy for them!
Ameri-can.
Ohh, umm, we kinda took a little detour on the way over here.
"...fuchsia and mauvvve. Those are the 66 colours of my bedroommmm." Thank you, thank you. Ohh, and I invite you to count the colours in your bedroom. Except for you. You go away.
No.
I don't even know how that would work!
No. But thanks.
I know but I'm having so much fun doing good deeds.
Oh, I was telling them about you and Emily. Y'know, try to get some sympathy.
Oh, you're such a gentleman. Come on! We're going to my place!
It's very weird! I don't want some guy down there telling me, I'm y'know, dilatedamundo!
No, I'm fine.
No, but you're questioning my method!
Wh-wh-what are you doing?
Oh, yeah! Back then y'know, we called the Great War. It really was!
Okay. Oh, no!
Yeah?
'Dear Ms. Buffay. Thank you for calling attention to our error. We have credited your account with five hundred dollars. We're sorry for the inconvenience, and hope you'll accept this- -football phone as our free gift.' Do you believe this?! Now I have a thousand dollars, and a football phone!
Okay.
I know. Then, I'm gonna marry Chandler for the money and you'll marry Rachel and have the beautiful kids.
Well, I mean, I'm not married married, ya know, he's just a friend and he's gay and he's just from Canada and he just needed a green card.
Ross, you can't tell her not to go. You just started dating.
I never had a bike of my own.
No!! Hey-hey that's not a Nutter-Butter, that's just an old Wonton!
Hey you guys, you will never guess who's coming to New York.
You wouldn't! Okay look, Rachel I know you really want to do this, but I-I've never been maid of honor to anyone before! And I know you've done it at least twice!
You wanna be on my list too? Keep talking! Has anyone seem my list by the way?
Or, y'know, I used to beg for money. Of course it helps if you've got y'know a little of this goin' on. Wow! I still have it!
Oh, all right. What did I have?
Ooh, Joey, that's actually a really good idea!
where were you standing?
Umm, Rachel and I were just discussing it and she had some very interesting insights.
Are you crazy?
Thank you.
You were great. But they still made fun of you.
Oh wait, one sec. One sec. Hey you! Behind the glass! Who are you looking at! I've always wanted to say that when I was in one of these rooms, which was never!
Don't feel too sorry for me. At least my boyfriend isn't gay.
Umm, look it, you-you can't kill yourself.
Listen. You are not going to believe this but, that is not me singing on the video.
: Dear Ms. Green, thank you for your inquiry, however... oh...
Okay.
Oh, you just know.
'Cause my, my grandmother's never had chicken pox. Please, please tell me you have, 'cause oh my God, I forgot how cute you are.
That's sweat. You throw up all morning, you'll have that glow too.
That's a bird?
Hey!
Rach, Rach, I just remembered. I had a dream about Mr. Geller last night.
Yeah. I really like his glasses.
Ok, you weren't there.
Hey Rach!
The next, next?
You just said...
Oh, look at that.
Yeah.
I know you didn't, I was talking about Monica.
So your brother's straigh huh? Seriously.
It's okay, I mean she had a really incredible life. And it's not like I'm never gonna see her again, y'know she's gonna visit.
Really?! Oh that's so exciting! Thank you! Thanks Mon! Oh but Mon, if you touch my guitar again I'll have to pound on you for a little bit.
Okay, okay. If I were omnipotent for a day, I would want, um, world peace, no more hunger, good things for the rain-forest...And bigger boobs!
Oh, I'm sorry. But I really like this guy. And I think he really happens to like me.
Well, I think it's great that the medical community is finally trying to help sick hamsters.
Oh that's right!
Don't you just love the way they talk?!
Oh man.
Oh, if that's what you want you then you really should run his head under hot water and bang his head against a table.
Hey!
No, no, it's just my tooth.
Shiny.
You guys!
Yeah!
Alright, I'm sorry but these people needed me. They work hard all week, it's Saturday night, they deserve to have a little fun. Go.
I know. They were mine.
Wow! I owe Rachel 20 bucks!
Look, why don't you just pay for it yourself?
Actually I said she abandoned me to write jingles.
I know. Use it.
Uh-huh!
He broke that.
Rachel, come here. Okay, I was just starting to take my Thanksgiving nap, and I had another dream about Jack.
That sucks! That's not a trip! I just came from the park! What are we gonna high five about at the stupid Central Park? "Well, it's right by my house, all right!"
Because she exchanges every gift she ever gets, it's like impossible to get her something she likes. Come on, let's trade!
Ugh, PBS!
Well, maybe it won't work out. Maybe Ross won't like her personality.
Is it okay if I leave this stuff here 'til Rachel's birthday party?
Why?
Oh, my first massage today is this incredibly gorgeous guy, and every time I see him I just want to do things to him that I'm not allowed to charge for.
But we have to!
Why do you think, she's having so much fun living with Joey?
I can be a waitress. OK watch this. Um, gimme two number ones, 86 the bacon, one Adam and Eve on a raft and rick'em, la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la.
"You wish."
Yes, and it is my dying wish to have that ring. See, if I'm not buried with that ring then my spirit is going to wander the nether world for all eternity...
Well tell that to them. Oh! You can't, their dead.
Umm, a flea market?
Uh-huh.
It's such a shame you can't see which finger I'm holding up.
Well, I've got to get out of this bed, I'm going crazy here. Crazy!
I'm not gonna. But you know what's cool though? Ok, if you had a friend named Pete, then I could say, 'Oh yeah, I know Pete, he's friends with my brother.'
In your atlas!
And, and!
No, I felt it on my hip. You could tell.
Susan, he looks just like you.
I sound amazing. I, I, I've never heard myself sing before. I mean, except in my own head. Oh, this is so cool, now I can hear what you hear.
Hi Monica.
Oh, I love you Hexadrin! Oh look! It comes with a story!
Why?
Yeah, y'know what, there are other fish in the sea.
Shut it down.
Ohh. What is this?
Hellooo!
Good!
Sure.
You know like... uh okay... uh... 'Could that report be any later?'
I mean this poor woman.
That she's gonna move in with you and maybe then she'll fall in love with you and then when she finds out you're already married, she'll just be happy. Y'know? You're just, you're very sad.
'Annie! Hi. Listen we got a problem with Joey Tribbiani, apparently he missed his audition. Who did you speak to in my office? Estelle, no, I don't know what I'm going to do with her. No. All right, so your husband leaves and burns down the apartment, the world does not stop.'
The exclamation point in the title scares me. Y'know, it's not just Freud, it's Freud!
I have to tell you this story. Okay, I was coming over here and this driver...
Uh-huh, yeah, that's my cheat sheet.
We were out of Doritos.
Okay, so we got some more good rejections, lots of stuff to work on.
He's even kind of cute.
'Kay, bye!
I know! I know, and I've only been playing for like an hour!
Relax every muscle in your body. Listen to the plinky-plunky music. Okay, now close you eyes, and think of a happy place. Okay, tell me your happy place.
Okay, yeah, I'll see you later! Don't forget about the moving in!
I can't believe you didn't tell me there was a suicide note!
Thank you!
That is so smart! Break it off. Break it off now.
Oh, how did it go?
Oh! Hello? Yeah this is Phoebe. Really?!
Yeah, no, I'm fairly intuitive and psychic. It's a substantial gift.
You know what, that's it, that's it.
Its mostly just dumb sister stuff, you know, I mean, like, everyone always thought of her as the pretty one, you know... Oh, oh, she was the first one to start walking, even though I did it... later that same day. But, to my parents, by then it was like "yeah, right, well what else is new?"
Well, we both have.
All right. Hold on. I got it. Nickel! How much more do we need?
Yeah. I'm a hard ass.
One of the babies is kicking.
'Hi, I have Phoebe Buffay returning a page. Okay, well, um, she's in her car I'll have to patch you through.'
Yeah, but then Jacques Cousteau came and he kicked his ass for betraying me! It was soo cool! Then, he took me diving and he introduced me to his pet seahorse, who, by the way, was totally coming on to me, and please, that is not gonna happen.
Well, so do a lot of people.
Ok.
You ok?
Nothing-Why?!
Yeah, we should get a move on if we wanna make those dinner reservations.
Ok, somebody is on their way to ruin wedding okay. And I have to warn somebody, alright. So if you don't give me that number then I'm going to come over there and kick your snooty ass all the way to New Glocken..shire.
Hey! I call her!
Ohh, that's too bad!
Nah-ha!
What?
Hi.
Oh absolutely. Shall we say, around seven?
That you don't stop talking about it.
About how good your cards were.
Happy birthday!
Kyle's ex-wife? You were supposed to divert her not date her!
They're gonna call her Chandler.
I don't know. Ooh! Ooh! Look it! Ah-ha!
No, you threw out Phoebe. I'm Ms. Regina Phalange. Phalange!
So, I decided I'm definitely going to go with either Joey or Chandler.
Did you find the dress?
Good choice.
Well how would you know?! You didn't even read it!
Hello. This is Phoebe Buffay. I was wondering, please, if-if it's not too much trouble, please, umm, might I speak to Miss Emily Waltham, please?
I'm kind, caring, and sweet. What's Monica like?
Oh, yay!
Well, I mean, I'm not my sisters, you know, whatever, and um... I mean, its true, we were one egg, once, but err, you know, weve grown apart, so, um... I dont know, why not? Okay.
Hello.
Okay, I hear you! Are you capable of talking about any thing else?
You guys, why didn't you tell me you were eloping?
Okay, time to bring up the rest of the cups. Oh, hi Joey!
Okay, fine. Come dinosaur, we're not welcome in the house of no imagination.
Okay!
Well, how-how-how is that possible? You barely know her!
Our mom.
Oh, this is so nice. Alright I have to make a speech. I just wanna say that of all the guys that Monica has been with, and that is a lot, I like you the best.
So how are things going with you two? Is she becoming your special someone?
Oh, ok, um, I mean Frank senior.
Nothing, I'm sorry, I'm just, I'm out of sorts.
Y'know what? We thought you were different. But I guess it was just the coma.
What was that?
Oh, hey, look, I found coffee! Okay, let's skedaddle.
Gooood luck! Gooood luck! We all wish you good luuuuuuuuck!!!
Yeah!
All right, I can't wait!
No, it's just like, ya know, it's a whole mess of stuff, ya know. It's like, yesterday, ya know, my dad was this, like, famous Burma tree surgeon guy and, ya know, now he's a, a pharmacist guy and. . .
No it's not great. No, she's coming to tell Ross that she loves him.
Um, oh, I've got a birthday party, with some work people.
Okay y'know what you have to choose. All right, if-if the most important thing on the planet to you is this cat poopy thing then, okay you can have Smelly Cat, but we won't be partners. So what's it gonna be?
Yeah, complicated 'cause of the love.
That's my first name.
And this time, they've ganged up to form one giant, super hat.
Ooh-oh! Someone's wearing the same clothes they had on last night. Someone get a little action?
Love is sweet as summer showers, love is a wondrous work of art, but your love oh your love, your love...is like a giant pigeon...crapping on my heart. La-la-la-la-la- Thank you. La-la-la-la...ohhh!
Why? Why would you do that?
If you never smoke again I'll give you seven thousand dollars!
Hey Rach, what time do you get off? We're all gonna do something tonight.
Thanks.
That's so great! 'Cause you already know how to do that!
Monica, if you get five cool points, you get to make somebody take off one item of clothing. It hasn't happened yet, but we're all very excited.
All right, wait just one more second. Hi, it's Phoebe and Rachel's. Please leave a message, thanks!
You guys wanna try and catch a late movie or something?
I've never driven it! Okay? Not once! Okay once. Okay, I drive it all the time.
Okay, yeah. Triple A can pick us up.
Yeah, it's... Y'know there's-no you may not!
Well, how could it not be breezy, no, 'cause, you're, you're in such a breezy place.
Oh, you are so going to Minsk. You belong in Minsk. You can't stay here just 'cause of me.
We're moving in together! Isn't it great! Yay!
I'm coming! I'm coming!
Hey, Monica!
Well no, it was my fault so you should get the nice room.
"Are you in there little fetus? In nine will you come great us? I will buy you some Adidas."
If I let go of my hair, my head will fall off.
Come in.
Ohh, you guys, remember that cute client I told you about? I bit him.
Yeah, I would've except I had a big spaghetti stain on the other side.
Okay, umm, question 2) Umm, did that marriage end A. Happily, B. Medium, or C. In the total abandonment of her and her two children?
Hi.
Umm, do health inspectors work on commission?
Yeah!
Ohh, get a room.
A birthday party.
Ooh, what a great table! Where-where did you get it?
CHANDLER AND MONICA!!!!
Of course I can! It's just good sense to backup your backup! Look, I've already lost Chandler!
Besides, it might be kinda fun to form the new A-Team.
You're-you're what?!
Would you stop that! Do you wanna know the first thing she said when she came back from her lunch with Richard? She didn't feel anything for him. She loves you!
Look, he gave me his night vision goggles and everything.
Okay.
All right, forget it, nevermind, you can have mine.
Oh, interesting you should call me that! Now that I may never have one!
So you're a gladiator! Wow!
With the web, the spider she dies, she does. She has babies and dies. It's like ya know, hey welcome home from the hospital, thud.
Ohh, Monica, I am so excited for you.
Yeah, so I said, "OK, relax please," y'know, I mean, sex can be just about two people right there in the moment, y'know, it's, if he wants to see me again he can call and if not, that's fine too. So after a looooot of talking. . . I convinced him.
Listen to you two. It's so sad. Looks like I'm gonna be going to the goddess meetings alone.
There you go!
OK, I wasn't in love with him and I was just helping out a friend.
Hey!
Okay, first I'm not crazy. And second, say it don't spray it. Anyway his name is Malcom, and he wasn't following me, I mean he was, but 'cause he thought I was Ursula, ick. And, that's why, that's why he couldn't just come up and talk to me. 'Cause of the restraining order.
Or, we can decide by whose ever name is closer to the word phone.
Oh, is the play over?
Ohh, give him a kiss for me!
Ok, all right, let's hear about the kiss. Was it like, was it like a soft brush against your lips? Or was it like a, you know, a "I gotta have you now" kind of thing?
Hi.
I-I'm sorry it wasn't one of those movies with, like, y'know, guns and bombs and, like, buses going really fast...
Okay, I'm gonna put this in the car.
Yay!! Oh so, you're not, you're not mad at us anymore?
All right. All right! If he wants a date? He's gonna get a date. All right, I'm gonna go in.
Because, every time I go to the dentist, somebody dies.
Huh? Can you just imagine getting down on one knee and handing her this gorgeous piece of weaponry?
Okay, I have a wedgie.
Yes! She's very excited about that.
Oh, no no, that side doesn't have one, the paramedics had to cut through it.
That oughta do it.
Well, we don't n-n-n-n-need a fireman, we'd, we'd like a good mechanic. Oh my God, here they come! Well, we gotta get out of here!
So how was, how was your date?
Thanks! Okay.
This is terrible, what are you going to do?
Oh, all right. Oh! Look what we almost took!
Oh no! That really is nothing, she is very sexually aggressive.
So you hired yourself a little treat did ya?
Oh, just ask him!
I'm so sorry! No I'm sorry! No I'm sorry! No I'm sorry!
Because, I'm just, I'm incredibly anal and an unbelievable control freak.
Yes.
I have quarters!
Hey Rach, wanna hear the new song I'm thinkin' of singing this afternoon? I wrote it this morning in the shower.
So great! Okay! Tomorrow we're gonna drive out to Montauk.
Uh-huh!
Chandler, you called Janice! That's how much you wanted to be with someone!
I know! But if I didn't work there, what else would I do?
Umm, she said she'd be back December 26th.
Oh Ross no. Be careful, that is very old! Okay? Early Colonial bird merchants used to bring their birds to market in that.
Oh.
It's not, it's not very Thanksgiving-y.
It's hard to believe that just a little while ago this was nothing but ingredients.
Yeah, yeah, no it's OK 'cause, I mean, I know he's there, so, that's enough for now.
Yeah, and nobody slept with that Xerox girl.
Uh-huh, got it. Ooh, I'm gonna see my dad. Wish me luck, Grandpa! Commercial
There was a girl, we'll call her Betty, and a guy let's call him Neil. Now I can't stress this point too strongly, this story isn't real. Now our Neil must decide, who will be the girl that he casts aside. Will Betty be the one who he loves truly? Or will it be the one who we'll call Ju...Loolie? He must decide, he must decide, even though I made him up, he must decide!
I know, I know. Hello.
Watching ballroom dancing?
Oh, okay, umm, hi kids! Um, it's me, Aunt Phoebe. I can't wait to see you. Please don't hurt me!
I still cannot believe you're engaged! Just 'cause its happening so fast; not 'cause you're such a loser.
Ugh!
Um, yeah. Look, I mean, Im not saying shes like evil or anything. She just, you know, shes always breaking my stuff. When I was eight, and I wouldnt let her have my Judy Jetson thermos, so she threw it under the bus. And then, oh, and then there was Randy Brown, who was like... Have you ever had a boyfriend who was like your best friend?
Hey!
Yeah! You know all those yummy noises? I wasn't faking.
Yeah that's right you are so busted. Book 'em.
Hello. My name is Regina Phalange. I'm a businesswoman in town on business. Would you like to see my card? Ooh, what did I do with my file-a-facts? I must've left it in conference room B.
Umm, do you know, umm Sipowicz?
Um, is, is there any chance that you're rounding up? You know, like from, like 20?
Oh, but, could we not go together? I,I don't wanna be the geek that invited the boss.
But there's a whole table of mini-muffin baskets. Which one did you send?
Yeah, but you have to keep the name too!
Weee!!!
Oh, it's so pretty. This must have cost him a fortune.
Um, gram, um, can I see the pictures of my dad again?
What?!!
I'm doing okay. I think it's going well. Do you think they're having fun? Am I talking to fast?
Hey Mon umm, if you do get married, can I bring two guests?
Here he is.
Oh, yeah, it's my mom's.
You don't have to be back for a half-hour!
I don't-Look I don't know what you're complaining about now? You were both aware of the situation!
Have you seen your guy's body?
I'm totally getting it!
Um, cake.
Eh, Monica it, it feels so weird, y'know, Chandler's your friend... Oh! Oh my God! Aw, all right take this bed, you can make other friends.
Oo! Is it for my birthday present?
Well umm, okay we were in the market and she bent down to get some yogurt and she just never came back up again.
Yeah. You won't be able to take it.
Oh right, maybe I'll just go home.
But Mon, you have to get our money!
They found their bodies the very next day, they found their bodies the very next... la la la la la la.
Oh my God! That's David!
Hmm?
Y'know, you're friend's getting married, it's gotta change things.
Ok.
Wow! You guys really don't know anything!
You know, if you want, I'll do it with you.
This is so great.
Ta-da.
Well you know, you juist, you eat them and you can tell.
Yeah! You're the best!
You guys kissed!!!!! What does this mean?!! Are you, are you getting back together?! Can I sing at your wedding?
She sells drugs to kids.
Bamn! There you go! Huh?
What's the big deal? I did it at Monica and Chandler's!
Uh-huh.
Really?!
Okay. Well there's one down.
All right, I've never been engaged and I've never really been married, but I can only tell you what my mother told me. Whenever you have doubts or fears or anxieties about a relationship, do not communicate them to your husband.
Okay, but you cannot tell him... but look whose back!
No! Hey, we're not leaving until we get paid! I don't know who she thinks she is! Enough is enough! Hey, widow?
You sound like a guy.
Hey!
Oh!
Oh my god! Where are you?
OK, hey, HEY. Is your boyfriend the boss of you?
Oh, hey, y'know what? Tell them that bone story.
Nu-uh!
Apology accepted.
Marcel?
Hey! You were really great! You were really, really great!
Yeah, do you want to break a dying woman's heart?

It's not kicking me, it's kicking one of the other babies. Oh ! Don't make me come in there!
Hey!
Oh.
Maybe the overlords needed them to steer their spacecrafts.
Okay, baseball. Rick, playing baseball. Okay, slides into second, maybe even his pants come down a little... Oh no-wait no, no! No! Okay, all right, sandwiches, sandwiches. Umm, okay, on a plate, maybe Rick's pants come down a little. No! No! Okay, Chandler! Okay Chandler, ooh, that's working.
Oh. It's just so unexpected! I...I uh...Boy I'll tell you it's just such an honor to be nominated for a Nobel Prize and y'know to win one for a massage. Especially after having just won a Tony award for best actress in...
What is this obsessive need you have to make everyone agree with you? No, what's that all about? I think, I think maybe it's time you put Ross under the microscope.
Good. I should really start wearing hats!
It's so inspired! Look at him! Look at him go!
Hi!
Good! Good! Five points!
Oh, okay that explains it. I got a call at two in the morning, but all I could hear was, like, this high squeaky sound, so I thought okay its like a mouse or a opossum. But then I realized where would a mouse or a opossum get the money to make the phone call.
All right, fine, fine, but if you're my next victim, don't come back as a poltergeist and like suck me into the TV set.
No!
Oh I got it!! Oh! Ew! Broken boob! Ow!
Oh, right, OK. Ole.
Please Rachel, I am not an idiot.
Sure! Umm, where are you from?
Ohhh, wow.
No, no, no, no, no, no. Yeah, could I just?
Oh my God, he's lost it. He's totally lost it.
Yeah, but then I can be you sidekick Vunda.
Oh I know.
Okay.
Oh my God!
I see.
Maybe that's 'cause she's not really gone.
Please!
Okay, so now they know that you know and they don't know that Rachel knows?
Uh-huh, let's go. Oh, wait I have gum. Okay. Good, very good, firm but tender. I'd recommend you to a friend.
So, Sebastian, do you do any volunteer work?
Okay. All right you yellow-bellied-lilly-livered-DRAW!!
17 years ago.
Well then I think that's it.
Yeah?
Wait, no, look at this! "Two bedroom, two bath, must be non-smoker, Satan worshipers okay..." Oh, yeah, but it's on the ground floor.
Well at least we know she's a woman.
Oh Ross, hi.
No. It's all right; it's probably false labour. They said that, that can happen near the end, just somebody get the book.
Oh right, yeah okay, my Mom could, and I can't. We don't have that....
Yeah, I'm a big surprise.
No. I'm sorry. It's just 'cause I couldn't be there. 'Cause all I ever get to do now is pregnant stuff, it just bums me out.
No-no, let me in!
Yeah, yeah, I'm going to be out there spreading joy to the people. I mean, last year, I spread a little joy but not really enough. So this year, I'm going to do the whole city.
Oh, he-he can't talk right now.
All righty. I'll be back in-in a little bit. Unless you wanna come with me?
You really thought it was perfect?
Oh, okay, yeah. I put your stuff in her room, and her stuff in your room.
Oh my God!
Oh my God! You're right! Go! Go tell Chandler! Hurry before it's too late! Wait no! Does this also mean putting out doesn't get you love?
Ooh, I just pulled out four eyelashes. That can't be good.
She cancelled! My namesake cancelled on me!
Wow! That's so great! Oh! Oh! Cougar.
Rachel! Come on out! Monica made breakfast!
Oh my God!
Oh my God, oh my God! Poor Monica!
Let's see. Oh my God! Oh... But no! No! You can't-you can't hire him, because that-it's not professional. Umm, this is for me yes? Thanks.
Or...or we can chant and dance around naked, you know, with sticks.
Yeah. Oh, that's gone too. This is Monica's bathroom right?!
Oooh, so so so, did you read the book?
Okay, good. There you go. Doesn't anyone feel better?
Ohhh.
Uh-huh. You've met your match Rachel Green.
Why?! What's happening to the coffee house?! Oh!
Na-uh, I am!
Maybe your resolution is to not make fun of your friends, especially the ones who may soon be flying you to Europe for free on their own plane.
Aww, Pheebs.
Someday I'll, tell you about the time I stabbed the cop.
Okay. Is it a kind of hot sandwich?
Yeah, but they didn't ask me! Y'know? This way I'm just y'know, the exotic, generous stranger. That's always fun to be.
Oh, well... 'cause.... you just... I don't like this question.
Okay.
So, what should you have done?
I thought I'd try to take a walk. Would you pour me some water? I'll be back soon.
God Joey, this is taking forever!
I wonder where she is. That is so weird.
But you-you-you came to see Lilly?
I've had better.
Oh yeah! Yeah, no, we're gonna connect, y'know bond, and everything.
What?! No! It was my idea!
Maybe we can like go to a movie or something.
No-no, it's okay. But are we sure we don't want the waterbed?
Ross!!!
Oh, I wish I could, but I don't want to.
No, no, no, I know, I know, ooh. 'Hi, this is Katelynn, from Phoebe Buffay's office. Um, is um, Ann there for Phoebe, she'll know what it's about.'
Trouble?
Phoebe. Phoebe. Phoebe, yeah. She named me after you I guess.
That's a dog, every house should have a dog.
What?!
Wait, wait, I'm getting a deja vu...no, I'm not.
I would love it if I weren't here!
Oh, was I doing it again?
Oh, ok bye-bye.
Oh my God! How did you get back here?!
Well, umm, my Mom's friend, Phoebe, is actually my birth Mom.
Y'know, I don't-I don't think it's you. This is a freaky place. Hey! Guys! Oh no, it's you.
Wow. So, okay, maybe that means that, you're not over Ross yet and you have issues with your father.
No! Think about it, it's a taxi that people take when they need to relax, it's...
Hi! Yeah, I'm calling on behalf of Monica Geller's eye, and is um, is Richard Burke in today. He's out of town, but does she want to see the on-call doctor?
Okay quick, help me get this off!
What? Is it - is this 'cause of what Ross said?
Thanks! So are you.
Yeah, oh I'm sorry, it must be really hard to hear! I tell ya, it's a lot easier having three babies play Bringing in the Noise, Bringing in da Funk on your bladder! I'm so sick of being pregnant! The only happiness I get is from a cup of coffee, which of course is decaf, 'cause-Oh! I'm pregnant!
Oh? Hello you.
Oh my God! I'm sorry, too soon. You go.
Oh, um, it was nice. Took him to a romantic restraunt, ordered champagne, nice.
Oh, come on! I think he's ready to get rid of, what did you call it? The cheap knock-offs and dinosaur junk.
But...
Okay, 'cause right after my mom killed herself, I was just in this really bad place, y'know personally. So, I just thought that it'd make me feel better if I wrote to Sesame Street, 'cause they were so nice when I was a little kid! No one ever wrote back.
It's a Thanksgiving miracle!
No, I like him a lot but I don't think I'm ready for this!
Oh God. So-so you're making porn movies.
Wow! And I'm a vegetarian! All right, all right, well I'm sorry, we'll put some ice on it.
Uh-hmm.
I will replace it, I promise. I feel so terrible.
Joey's!
Earl! I'm Phoebe.
Maybe because you never listen to anything that I say. I talk about her all the time! DENISE!!!!!
Duh!! Christmas!
Okay.
Well the doctor says it takes a couple days, but my body's always been a little faster than Western medicine.
Op, the ruined quiches are ready.
Do the claws again.
I just-I thought you guys were doing it, I didn't know you were in love!
That sounds really great, but maybe you should be in charge of wiping.
Oh, there they are!
I know what time you said.
Come on! Let us be guys! Maybe we want to be guys!
Yeah, but you always say that.
Well, I am.
Which one?
Okay.
Yum-my!
Hi.
Oh.
Oh.
Yeah. You're trying to figure out where you know me from? All right, I'll give you a hint. From porn! Okay? Yeah your pervert boyfriend watched me in a porno movie! See?
Absolutely!
They're tiny and chubby and so sweet to touch, and soon they'll grow up and resent you so much. Now they're yelling at you and you don't know why, you cry and you cry and you cry. And you cry and you cry and you cry...
Yeah, I definitely. I don't like the name Ross.
...teen!
Well, umm, not much. But, I was just thinking that since those guys just got engaged that maybe it would be nice if they had some privacy, y'know? So, could I just move in with you for a couple days?
Speech! Speech! Let's hear from the birthday girl! Huh?
Do it!
Oh, so this is all about money! Y'know it's bad enough that-Ow! Oh, you have got to be kidding!
It's Phoebe.
Yeah! Sure! Ooh, I left my purse up at Monica's. I'll be right back.
Well, I said, I told him y'know, that I was the executor person of Francis' will and that I needed to talk to him so I'm gonna meet him at the coffee house later.
Hmm, something bad to tell Rachel... Bad news for Rachel, what could that be?!
Oh. Uh, I'm on.
I am.
But Joey, you're gonna be fine. You don't need that show, it was just a dumb soap opera.
Where's Chandler?
What?
Chandler, easy, easy. Go to your happy place. La la la la la la la.
Okay! All right! Yeah! 'Cause I just can't picture it.
Yu-huh. That's when my mother would shut off the TV and say 'The end'.
Does, um, anyone wanna see?
Wow! And hey, it's cool if you're a lesbian!
Do you have my birth certificate?
Yeah, come to papa.
Hey Rachel?
Oo! You should have one of us do it!
Sorry, mix up. Hey, how was the movie?
I don't know, it would totally depend on her coloring and... You got the job!!
Stay.
You said it was okay!
You heard her too?! You have the gift!
Ohhh!!!
Really?
Well, I taught me and I love me.
Umm, when I get married will you be my maid of honor?
Oh, okay. Excuse me sir? Could you come with me please? You have a phone call.
What's up? Tell Monica I'm sorry. Tell her yourself!
No, I'm really okay with this. Y'know why? 'Cause look at them, and I made that, so... I know it's gonna be like a million times harder to give up a baby but, oh my God, it's gonna feel like a million times better, right? I wanna do this. I wanna carry your baby.
Um, yeah I guess that's me.
Everyone. Except for uh... no everyone.
Oh, it's like the mother ship is calling you home.
No, I can spot you from here.
No, no, he hasn't been around.
Marcia and Chester are mad at Phyllis.
Shhh!! Please! What's he saying?
Hey! What are you doing here?
Why, what happened?
Hey.
Come on Mon, let her throw the ball.
Definitely!
Nah. Not really.
Rach?
What else?
What were you thinking?
You're Frank Buffay?
No.
Yeah, and maybe that you're a real
Okay umm, well, first Chandler and Monica will get married and be filthy rich by the way. Yeah. But it won't work out.
Because I think it means more to you.
Yes! Exactly! And that's why...
Oh, what was that for? Like a bake sale?
All right well let's see, Ross is a good father, but Joey has a boat-This is hard!
Ooh! How was Kathy's play?
Yeah. So?
Okay, I'm gonna go get Frank.
Oh yeah.
Ok, Ben, this is the part where Ernie buries Bert in the sand and can't find him. Now, I've looked ahead on the tape and he does find him again. But, ok, before that happens, there's some pretty rough goin' for a while but I think we can handle it. And, there's just the alphabet but we know that ends well so. Ok, here we go.
Ooh yeah! Then umm, what goes on top of the salami?
Okayyyyy, open up!
Hey! Maybe you'll die!
So?
Oh, that sucks!
Well, we should go.
Not for you.
Fine!
Sure!
I remember the day I got my first pay check. There was a cave in in one of the mines, and eight people were killed.
Get your foot off my contestant! Judge!
Oh, this life! Oh okay no, Chandler's is worse.
I know no, no, y'know you don't deserve this, you don't Ross. You're, you're really, you're so good.
Y'know what that means?
I would like to make a pledge. I would like to donate $200.
Oh! Suddenly somebody knows all about the side affects!
Hey! So you guys have anything planned for the big last night?
That's okay Rachel. I'm not judging you; that's just who you are. Me. I'm more free y'know? I run like I did when I was a kid, cause that's the only way it's fun. Y'know, I mean didn't you ever run so fast you thought your legs were gonna fall off? Y'know, like when you were like running towards the swings or running away from Satan? The neighbor's dog.
OK, let's go.
Ohh, I think she knows where my Dad is.
Oh, I'm flaky. I'll say anything.
Oh wait, my grandmother's dead.
Eh, don't be so hard on yourself. If someone I was still in love with was getting married...
Whatever! What about you Meg?
I guess it was kinda funny.
Okay, now's not the time Joey. All right? You can yell at me tomorrow.
No, it's just that he got this new like home theater dealie, and he wants y'know, us to check it out.
Ross, please! My make-up!
Ooh!
Hey, it's your Thanksgiving too, y'know, instead of watching football, you could help.
Oh good! Because we have an "I'm sorry" song.
Wow, I have the spirit of an old Indian women living in mine.
Well, deep-deep-deep down!
Most likely. Okay, I'm gonna be out there.
Okay. Listen, I'm sorry about before. Do you have anything her for $10.
Oh, wow.
Well actually, I know what time Chester and Marcia said.
Yeah, or you know, you could just wish that I didn't have them now.
Oh my God!!
It's gone.
It's okay to laugh right?
Who said you were?
Well, it's going okay.
We're practically kissing.
I found it!
Ok, so, ok, was he holding you? Or was his hand like on your back?
Rachel? Patrick is really rich. Give her some money.
Well, yeah! But I'm not gonna take anymore crap. Okay? No more Mrs. Nice Bucket!
Yeah.
I brought a bunch of stuff for the house, so check it out. Ha-ha.
Saved your ass.
Ooohh, why?
Well, are any of those people here?!
Come on, seriously! When did it end?
Oh, I'm Phoebe Buffay. I'm one of Ross's best friends.
Which-which sister is this? Is this the spoiled one or that's bitter?
Well, we didn't have a lot of money. But the girl across the street had the best bike! It was pink and it had rainbow colored tassels hanging off the handle grips, and-and-and a bell and this big, white wicker basket with those plastic daisies stuck on.
Yep, we shook on it. Yeah but believe me that is not how he wanted to seal the deal.
Okay. So, this wire is connected to this wire which plugs into here. Okay so, to get the beeping to stop all I have to do... Well done, Pheebs. What do you want from me?!!!!!!!
Uh-huh.
Come on you know what to do! You hire the first one! You don't hire an assistant because they're cute, you hire them because they're qualified.
Yeah?
Oh-okay, I get the game now.
Yeah, all right. Meanwhile, I'm gonna do whatever I can to help this so, I'm just gonna y'know, lie it your chair, Y'know? Yeah, good, I'm let gravity y'know, do its jobs.
What? Did you go to a costume party? Let me guess umm Pancho Vila? and you're Bob Saget.
That wasn't a date! That was, that was just friends getting together... having sex.
Yeah, I just don't buy it.
Ooh! So now why can't we tell Chandler?
Thanks. Hi, um, 'kay. I'd like to start with a song that's about a man that I recently met, who's, um, come to be very important to me. 'Kay.
Monica, she will kill you. She will kill you like a dog in the street.
Ten dollars an hour for what?
Hi!
Yeah. Its just, you know, its this whole stupid Ursula thing, its...
Okay, thank you very much, I'm gonna take a short break!
No, which one? The right or left? 'Cause the left one is lucky...
Come on Ross. We're sorry. Please tell us what it is.
It was really sweet. The last thing she said to me was; "Okay dear, you go get the eggs and I'm gonna get the yogurt and we'll meet at the checkout counter." And y'know what? We will meet at the checkout counter.
They've been quiet for a long time.
Oh good! All right, so you decided to tell him about the Richard thing.
And chili!
Yeah, I-I can't-I mean y'know I was trying to be really y'know okay and upbeat about it, I just-I feel so dwarfed by your musical gift. I...
No! Because he's in love with the British chippy! Look, Rachel, if you go, you're just gonna mess with his head and ruin his wedding! Y'know, it's too late! You missed you're chance! I'm sorry, I know this must be really hard, it's over.
What's going on?
So now what's going on here?
Okay, and then this is the coffee house. This is where I play my music.
Okay, I guess. I mean... I don't know, it's just, I guess I know it's going to be over soon.
Oh, look what we almost left.
Well okay, it's already February and I've only given two massages and they were both the worst tippers in the world!
I stepped in something icky.
Yeah! Now, why do you want to kill yourself?
You wanna do it right now?
Well, it just, it doesn't feel like playing anymore, it feels like work. It's like I'm working in the field.
Boy! I didn't see that coming!
Oh, it's Ross on one of his drives!
You didn't get the money, did you?
There we go.You know what, if we were in prison, you guys would be, like, my bitches.
Thank you.
So, what movie should we see?
All right.
Yeah. Except for, y'know when you're on a date and you're getting along really great but the guy's translator keeps getting in the way.
Oh! Oh! Oh no!! You swore!
I know who it is you remind me of. Evelyn Dermer. 'Course, that's before she got the lousy face lift. Now she looks like Soupy Sales.
No! Think about it okay? This isn't even my regular job! Okay? And my first day on the job, you're my first call! And-and somebody else might've hung up on you, but I wouldn't do that because I know about this stuff. My mom killed herself.
Yeah. 'Hello. Oh my God, I totally forgot! Well can't someone else do it. But, I have company. Yeah, no look, that's all right I'll come in.' Um, Frank, I'm really sorry but I have to go to work. It's-it's one of my regulars and he's insisting that I do 'um.
No, yeah! The groom cannot see the bride!
I am extremely talented!
Yeah.
Hey, Mel Gibson and Clint Eastwood.
What are we going to do?!
No, I mean I was really acting my ass off.
Joey.
Well, you're not more excited than I am! No way! I'm the most excited!
You guys are so pathetic, I, oh, OH, XANADU! OH.
The voice woman. Ya know, I mean, she has a great voice but she doesn't have a video.
Okay.
Drum roll.
I don't use a curling iron.
And all of the sudden his hands weren't the problem anymore.
Yuh-huh! I was the last one to know when Chandler got bitten by the peacock at the zoo. I was the last one to know when you had a crush on Joey when he was moving in. Looks like I was second to last.
Oh, Chandler funny?
I'm pretty.
You see? Nothing is good enough for her!
Yeah, me, too, technically.
Well, just buy the damn boat!
Ewww!
Hey.
No, nothing.
Well, I can't help you.
And I have your name and the fact that you're a drifter, so the ball's pretty much in your court.
No. This is what I do for luck, ok.
Ok, all done.
Yes! Your honor?
Hey you guys, Hums While He Pees just asked me out!
Jack!! Hey!
That's easy! You just have to think of him as a-as a jar of pickles that won't open.
See, we don't need them.
I, OK....
Yes, good! Ok...
Hey.
Okay. Bye!
Oh my God, so do I!
Okay, I understand why Superman is here, but why is there a porcupine at the Easter Bunny's funeral?
Fine! Fine! Oh-oh!
Me?!
That's short for Phoebe?! I thought that was just what we called each other!
Hey! Why isn't it Spiderman? Y'know like Goldman, Silverman...
Okay so, by melting, you meant melting.
Dun-dun-duuuur! Sorry.
Just for some short-term-work. You know, until I get back some of my massage clients.
Anyway, I just wanted to say thank you, it was just, it was so sweet.
If she says no, can I have the ring?
Thanks.
So Chandler, I-I'd love to come by tonight.
It's, I mean, it's nothing, I'm fine. It's my friends. They-they have a liking problem with you. In that, um, they don't.
Chicken. Which is so ironic considering I'm a vegetarian.
Y'know, if you want, you can call her machine, and if she has a lot of beeps, that means she probably didn't get her messages yet.
How do you know?
OK. Oh Monica! Guess what!
Thank you! And Happy Holidays.
The mailman was downstairs, so I brought up your mail.
No.
Does Joey have any idea?
Oh, this is my friend Roger.
Ohh! Oh, the Chelsea Reporter, ohh, this used to keep me so warm.
Since when are you into swing music?
Ok, here are the birthday candles. Where's the birthday cake?
Thank you.
Neither.
Look everybody, look at my new dollhouse!!
Yeah and I-I found you one too who is not a weirdo.
I do! I do! I do! I do! Ugh, like I can really chase you. I'm carrying a litter.
Oh that's so great! Ohh, so what's going on now?
Morly Safer.
Before I start, I just wanna say that umm, I have a cold, so if I sneeze in the middle of song, it's not on purpose. Oh, except the last verse of Pepper People. Smelly cat, smelly cat. What are they feeding you? This chick sounds good. Smelly cat, smelly-- Hey Gunther, be a good little boy and bring me a whiskey.
Mrs. Waltham. Hi. It's Phoebe again.
Oh yeah, come here.
Chuck Woolery?
Oh yes, yes, yes you can. Just say, um, 'Phoebe, my work is my life and that's what I have to do right now'. And I say 'your work?! Your work?! How can you say that?!'. And then you say, um, 'it's tearing me apart, but I have no choice. Can't you understand that?'. And I say 'no! No! I can't understand that!'.
Congratulations!
What?
What surprise party?
All right. Ok, but, but! You have to promise that you will not be all like control-y and bossy and Monica about it.
Hey!
You mean in case someone is trying to steal your bamboo sleeping mat or your kettle of fish?
Yeah, maybe, yeah. You know, and, and I'll knock on the door and, and he'll hug me and I'll have a dad. Ya know and I'll, I'll go to his pharmacy and everyone will be really nice to me 'cause, you know, I'm Franks daughter.
Joey, why don't you talk to Chandler about moving back?
Hi Geller-Bing residence. How can I help?
All right fine! This looks like so much fun.
Oh, I can't believe you called her fat.
Oh, how'd that happen?
A real man wouldn't just run to the hospital! No! What would, what would Krog do?
What is your job?
Bye, fat ass.
Which would you rather be a fireman or a swimmer?
Hey-Ooh, how's Hilda? Is she working out?
Oh-my-God!
Frank! Hi!
Well, I didn't get embarrassed running next to Miss . But no, okay. No, no, I can see why running with me would be embarrassing to you. Yeah, okay. You're uptight.
Oh, it's so pretty. This must have cost him a fortune.
Y'know, me, Rachel, the birds, the babies...
May I ask why?
Ha-ha. No, it's just I'm so pregnant that I-my guitar doesn't fit anymore. So I thought 'til I'm not, I'm just gonna play all my songs on this drum. It sounds really cool!
That is funny.
Ewww!
Come on, there's gotta be something.
There'll be times when you get older when you'll want to sleep with people just to make them like you. . . But don't. Cause that's another thing that you don't wanna do, everybody That's another thing that you don't wanna do.
She seems fine now.
Oh, I know a way that you can decide! All right, I'm going to ask you a series of questions and you answer as quickly as you can.
Uh-huh.
I'm just taking it to be re-wired.
All right, I already didn't give them back to you, that's what I said. Where is that other earring?
Hi, Ben. I'm your father. I am... the head. Aaaaaahhhh.... Alright, this barbecue is gonna be very fun.
Hi, Max!
Wait a minute! So when Emily comes you're just, you're not gonna see Rachel anymore?
Didn't you sleep together?
Hey.
And then you say that it's almost midnight and you have to go because you don't wanna start the new year with me if you can't finish it. I'm gonna miss you. You scientist guy.
Oh, that is so unfortunate.
Oh!
I..., a jingle? No, no-no-no, no.
How come?
Marcel?
Rach, it's gonna be okay! You guys are the best!
What?
Yeah, um, which ones in particular were great for you?
Yeah?
Yeah, just, okay, look I'm going. Um, come on. Op, op, behind the pillar, which way am I gonna go?
Aw, and I was gonna ask you to marry me because I forgot to say hello to you last week.
Look, she only suspects something okay? She doesn't know for sure, so just throw her off the track.
I-I wanted to apologise if I-y'know seemed a tad edgy yesterday at my shower. Y'know it's just the hormones, y'know.
Oh, I couldn't go in.
Really?! What's your name?
I'm, I'm freaking out! Monica kinda trusted me with something and she shouldn't have! All right, I haven't lived here in a while, so I have to ask you something. Does Monica still turn on the lights in her bedroom?
Okay, stop! Larry, okay, can't you just be Larry and not Larry the health inspector guy? Y'know I mean it was really exciting at first but now it's like, okay, so where are we gonna eat ever?
Yes! They called and you didn't get it! Okay, I mean you didn't get it, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
And then... your face is bloated?
Okay, I can do that! Oh, by the way, I love my office.
Ugh, what's right with them?
Ok, do you know how to go from D to A minor?
If it was, would you stop hanging out with her?
No. 'Cause you need that. No, it's okay, thanks.
So how are things going with you?
Oh, okay. Feel better, Rachel, 'kay?
Oh!
Minsk?
No but you shouldn't! Don't ever do that again.
Yeah, I... Well y'know I-I mean I missed the-the semi-finals, so I'd just be lost.
And why not?!
Okay, so it's probably just the Ross thing then.
Yeah! So--ooh, I gotta ask you though. How did you know where to find me?
Thank you. No? All right. Oh, it's so nice to see you.
Hi.
Oh, well get in line missy. So, can I have a ride stud?
I can't believe you're gonna ask Monica to marry you!
Yeah, not the one I had my eye on.
So you wouldn't mind if he was dating someone else?
Hi!
Dumbass!
Mmmm hmmm.
What? Oh, are you pregnant too?!
Oh, okay, I learned how to shoot a lay-up, a foul shot, and a twenty-three pointer.
Hi! Oh, yeah, no, I know. You're a chef. I know, and I thought of you first, but um, Chandler's the one who needs a job right now, so....
Oh, I know.
Yeah, and y'know what? I don't give a tiny rat's ass.
Yeah, um, in Albany, can I have the number of Frank Buffay. . . OK, um, in Ithica. . . alright, um, Saratoga. . . Oneonta. Alright, you know what, you shouldn't call youself information.
I'm having another heart attack!! Call 9-1-1!!
Oh yeah! I'd let him check out my kitchen floors.
Yeah, coffeehouse.
No, she just died today! Okay, umm, we're having a memorial service tomorrow.
I-I sure will, take care.
Oh I do, it's.... it's Bob Saget. She hates him.
Why? What happened now?
Sorry. ..Y'know, those stupid soda people gave me seven thousand dollars for the thumb.
Okay, obviously you don't know much about the U.S. government.
Yeah, all right.
Oh no wait no, this is wrong! Ross isn't here!
Na-uh, no, we are all responsible for our own babies.
Okay, well if I was in this for the money, I'd be a millionaire by now, y'know. You just got to get out of that jingle head sweetie.
They're gonna get through this, aren't they?
No, no, it's not your fault. You know it's partly my fault, 'cause I made you quit cold turkey. Sorry, no. Okay, well, I mean, I can't date you anymore, 'cause your, you know Wow! But um, but I will definitely, definitely help you get over my sister. Okay, stalk me for a while. Huh? Yeah, and, and, and, I'll be like an Ursula patch.
Come on Joey, don't make me feel badly about this.
Yes, you will be very sad. All right, well I gotta go tell Rachel the good news.
OK honey, you're dating Ross.
Let's run towards them!
Are you asking me to have a frenaissance?
Hey.
I'm wearing his briefs right now.
Ooh, I have to tell you something.
Yeah, okay, listen, umm, Mom, I hope you know you still mean a lot to me. And you're welcome to come back anytime.
Yeah, I already have my bell and later on...I get my bucket.
Which Richard?
But if-no look, okay. These jerks might not care about you, but the universe does! And that says a lot!
Yeah I know what I wanted to ask you. Um, can you roll your tongue? Because I can, and my Mom couldn't, and I thought y'know, I figured that was something I got from our Dad.
Okay, quit down.
Okay. Whoa, sorry. Why were you just like all in the dark?
Oh my God!! You threw Pepper on the fire!
Yeah, I'm sure that happened.
Yeah!
Or not, whatever.
Is it a meatball sub?
Hold me close, young Tony Dan-za.
Alright, I'm, I'm gonna go. I'm sorry about the dog, everything. I'm sorry.
Oh yeah, I'm sure. And all of a sudden his hands weren't the problem anymore.
Okay.
Um, I'm getting a lily for my Mom. 'Cause her name's Lily.
Wow! I didn't know you guys actually used those.
Umm, yeah, I'd like to go out with you officer...
Yeah! And until then you are going to sing to me because the radio's broken and you are selfish but have a nice voice.
Why?
Yeah, I know, but I don't think that means anything.
Okay, okay, okay, the black. But, oh, do you have black, with the little strappys?
Okay.
Cabin of loooooovvvvve.
OK, so what, you're just never gonna see him again?
Did I use that already today? I'm sorry.
That might work!
"Crazy underwear, creepin' up my butt. Crazy underwear, always in a rut. Crazy under--wear..." Oh No! What is he doing here? All right, just keep playing, just keep playing. You'll get through this; you'll be fine. Okay, thank you. And, as always no one talk to me after the show.
Hey! So I had a great day, Rick and I really hit it off, and we started making out, and then my boss walked in and fired me for being a whore.
Sure.
Bye!
Did you find it?
Oh no. Did umm, did she say why?
I wanna hear "The Sound."
Ok. Listen, just don't say anything about me, ok.
Good! Great! You can go first.
Hey, Joey! Hey! Ooh! Ooh! I just say someone on the-that looks just like you on the subway. And I was gonna go over and say 'hi!' but then I figured, he doesn't care if he looks like you.
...I feel a little sneezy And now I-
Hm, I mean maybe no-one ever really goes. Ever since my mom died, every now and then, I get the feeling that she's like right here, y'know? Oh! And Debbie, my best friend from junior high- got struck by lightning on a miniature golf course- I always get this really strong Debbie vibe whenever I use one of those little yellow pencils, y'know? ...I miss her.
Yeah, um, she was 82 years old. Her name was um, Mrs. Adelman.
None the less.
Ugh, I hate this year!
Oh no-no, no, I made a promise to myself that the next time I would talk to Ursula would be over my dead body. And that's not happening 'til October 15th, 2032.
No, huh uh, I'm sorry, no. No, I'm not some like sloppy second, charity band. You know what, there are thousands of places in this city where people would be happy to pay to hear me play. When I play, I play for me, I don't need your charity. Thank you! La la la la la la la....
How did you do that?
Okay, it just seems pretty wild and you're so-y'know so...vanilla.
Ohh, ohh, Lorne Green?
Fine, I'll go call her.
I need to talk to you, it's pretty urgent. It's about Monica and Chandler.
Umm, the street. Come on, let's go to the street. Ooh, listen, don't go onto the balcony until after I get back.
Great! Okay, good for you!
Uh-huh, yeah!
I won! I won! I finally won!
Oh, give it to me.
Okay.
What, he's not still following her. Do you think he is still following her?
Oh, yeah, he clipped on, he said call him as soon as you get a chance, he's at Flimby's.
Two?
Hey!
Hey, Joey, when you said the deal with Santa Clause, you meant?
Whoa!! That-okay, that's a lot of pressure on me and my uterus. So, well okay, so is there-is maybe is there something that I can do y'know just to like help make sure I get pregnant?
No, not wieght... y'know, more like insulation.
Hey. What a day. I took her everywhere. The Museum of Modern Art, Rockefeller Center, Statue of Liberty.
Oh, Joey! Oh, okay, see I didn't recognize you wearing, in those....pants.
Okay, I just thought of the perfect guy for Rachel to take to her thing.
Oh, no wonder I don't feel full.
Oh! Well, if that's what you want...
Hi! It's me. And soup. Hey, I just saw Josh, he looks so yummy in your leather jacket.
Sure, oh, is, is Frank home.
No! Why?
Mailbox.
What-what's up?
Okay, well I think that they're in my purse. Why don't you go get dressed and I'll look for them.
Well, I mean look it's, it's not your fault, you know. I mean this is just what, what she does to guys, okay.
Come on, play that funky music white boy.
So, how are things going with crazy? Has she cooked your rabbit yet?
Oh, see, Jack did love the cow.
No-no-no, I know, but you and I are different people though, and this is a totally different situation, and I know that I am not gonna regret this.
Chandler, Chandler.
Hi.
Oh no!
I know, it's tough. You know what the first thing I did after my mother's funeral was?
Yeah?
Why?
Yeah. Oh! It'll be like I have a wife in the fifties!
YOU KNOW?!!!
Didn't you like, just get your eyes checked?
Yeah, well me too, yeah. I think that's the challenge.
Don't feel bad. You know they used to like you a lot. But then you got promoted, and, you know, now you're like "Mr. Boss Man". You know, Mr. Bing. Mr. Bing, "Boss Man Bing".
Oh.
You guys. You suck too.
Sticky shoes, sticky shoes, always make me smile. Sticky shoes, sticky shoes, next time I'll.... avoid the..... pillleeeee.
That-It's not the same thing! This is totally different! This is with David! Remember David, the scientist guy? Okay, he's very special to me.
Whoa! I kinda liked it.
Something just brushed up against my right leg!
Got cha again, you guys are so easy.
Yeah, but I-I-I-I can do that for you, I'm gonna do that for you.
Eeee!!! Eee!! Eee!!
I miss you too!!!!
Well, it's not so much that you know, like I don't believe in it, you know, it's just...I don't know, lately I get the feeling that I'm not so much being pulled down as I am being pushed.
Oh yeah!
What make you think I can?!
Oh, yeah, that's the word I use when I can't remember the real thing.
Hey. Guess what! My landlord just called and my apartment is gonna get ready soon, so I guess I'll be moving out.
Oh my God! I killed him! I killed another one! And this curse is getting stronger too, to bring down something that big.
Joey! Wow, you didn't rip off any buttons.
Oh, I thought you weren't coming. What? Where were you?
I just wanted to see what all the fuss was about.
Oh hi!
Yeah? Why?
Easy. Step. How did it get on?
What about Glen? He could be a Glen.
Which you just gave up really quickly.
What is this? What's going on?
Yeah.
Oh, look, he's closing his eyes again.
"Good-bye Phoebe and Ursula. I'll miss you. P.S. Your Mom lives in Montauk." You just wrote this!
Oh that's right. You're still set on that?
Hi.
Most people don't like their jobs, I love my job! I have not been working for three hours and I'm already going crazy. I miss Joan.
How do you feel?
You're there!
Yeah, but, y'know, it's... it would be like starting on the fifteenth date.
They're not even touching the lasagna!
Umm, well I sorta have some bad news, can I come in?
Chandler, Chandler.
Oh yeah, you're solid. Yeah, you're just no me.
Ben, dinner!
Yeah, oh, Princess Leia and the gold bikini, every guy our age loved that.
Hey! Ooh, how was your first day working at the restaurant?
Oh I do! Oh, y'know what? No. Wait a second. I know it's in here somewhere.
Well, kinda. Yeah. Yeah.
You know who shaved you? That was me.
It's...
Fine. But you can't help me develop my new universal language.
If you would've let me finish, it goes on to say that he's probably not gay.
Oh my God, you guys are selling the entertainment center?
Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God!! So I-I mean so in a few months I'm going to have three full grown babies just walkin' around inside me?! Oh! Oh! And it's gonna be one of those log rides where they just come shooting out!
Oh my God! Why would you play hide and seek with someone you know is a flight risk?!
I-I mean I, well I think I can figure it out. I guess y'know I was born, and everyone started lying their asses off!
Great.
Hey.
Bras! We bought bras! We bought bras.
Smoked a joint? You know, lit a bone? Weed? Hemp? Ganja?
Ow! My ass. Okay. Okay. Oh, shhh!
Oh! I'm a masseuse. I give people massages and stuff.
No, no, that's the ghost for the attic.
Oh God!
Oh, hi.
Ooh, sorry. Um, and, and then you put your arms around me. And then you put your arms around me. And, um, and then you tell me that you love me and you'll never forget me.
Yeah! What have you got to lose? Y'know you might even end up with someone really special if you pick my guy.
Oh no, I'm not playing tonight.
Hey Rach, you wanna get some coffee?
Yeah, this is the guy I was telling you about.
Hey!
Talk about crap. Try listening to Stella Niedman tell the story of her and Rod Steiger for the hundredth time.
Wow! Hello, Mr. Chandler.
Ross, went to get a cab so we can all... No, wh-what are you doing! No, Monica, no!
I'm trying, but man that guy can push my buttons!
Okay but that's why you have to buy it, so it can fulfil it's Christmas destiny, otherwise there gonna throw it into the chipper. Tell him, Joey
Ohh, that's so nice! How great! Well, where? Where's the trip?!
She is gonna hate me.
Oh, I have dinner plans with Joey. We get together about once a month to discuss the rest of you guys.
Me too.
Hey.
That is so weird! I had a dream that you'd have lunch with Richard.
Hey!
So umm, now do you have any of Matt Lauer's clothes here? Maybe? Just ones that haven't been cleaned yet?
Oh.
Well, it's better than us deciding.
Well, if you must know I have written 14 books. And as I am the only one who has read them, I can tell you that they all have been very well received.
