I'm breaking up with you!
So is it like art?
How about just the bridemaids?

Good morning receptionist.
So, you're like a zillionaire?
Hey, how'd it go?
Oh, it's Dr. Seuss!
Oh, yeah. Ok, thank you.
I'd call that excessive.
It's Monica's bed. What?
I don't even have a 'pl'.
Oh yeah, I totally agree.
Which one do you have?
Ohh! I did not get that.
No wonder your pregnant.
Was it not pain-free?

I think it's important that you do.
You are a terrific actor.

Okay. Well there's one down.
So? What if they do?
Believe me I'm trying.

She seems fine now.
Oh, this is my friend Roger.

How'd you know I was coming?
I never get calls!! Hello?
I was in charge of cups.
Oh no, I'm not playing tonight.

Ok, yeah, ok. Oh, OK.
Is Rachel having the baby?
Hi Rob Dohnen.
I beg to differ .
Just calm down woman!
Why else would I be here?
Eww, I don't wanna do that.
You can't have sex with her!
Hi! Wish me luck!
Don't, don't do the plan-laugh.
So, what should you have done?
You got fake numbered.
Okay, get out of my kitchen!
Then don't touch one!!

Umm, I'm a masseuse...by day.
Aren't we done with that?

Oh, I hear divorce bells.
Not if I get there first.
You're the best. Thanks. Oh!
It's okay to laugh right?
No, no, it's just my tooth.
I'm pretty sure it's gun.
Hey!-Hey! What's going on?
Ah-ha! Too cocky!

You were supposed to tell her!
Are you gonna go over there?

I know, I took it hard too.
Chandler, you stink of cigarettes.
Ok, welcome to the fu-oh.
He's even kind of cute.
So-so you're really not going?

What is that sparkly thing?
Nothing! This is not over!
You really thought it was perfect?
God, Susan is so fun!
But you didn't give it to her?
What were you modeling for?
Okay, from the top, people!

Doing it on this table.
And the big one's for me!
Hey! Rachel! Come on!!!!
You won't even taste it?
Stick a fork what?

OK, is this really my father?
Okay, bye-bye! Good trip!
Hey, what's going on Joe?
You don't like ice cream?
Well, do you care about friendship?
So tell me about this girl?

Well, so do a lot of people.
Never mind, I got it.
Oh no, Ross doesn't know anything.
I'm so glad you could make it.
Oh, I'd say about a month.
Don't get me started on that.
Ooh, oh, Rachel, don't look.
What kind of an emergency?
Yeah, yeah. They even do you.
Richard Simmons?! Oh my God!
Wanna go see a movie?
Here. Y'know, just in case.
She was a drug dealer!
Fine, I'll go call her.
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't see you there.
I haven't really had any yet.
What does the sign say?
Broke them all, huh?
Him you're friends with.
Hey! New wallet, huh?
Okay, fine! Fine! Mmm...hmmmmm....

I don't want it to end either.
Do you not know each other?
Well, do you see any babies?

Yeah, we'll talk at dinner.
Hey, everybody. Happy Thanksgiving!
Oh, you're not going? Oh, why?
Huh. Okay, Mr. Perkazet.
Anything I can do to help?
Oh no, she won't tell us.
Well, can you dance at all?
Yeah I bet! Look out!
I stepped in something icky.
My guy is well read.
So whose ring is it?
What?! What else did you do?
Okay, then I must be disoriented.
Uh huh. Why is that?
Wow? Really? That's fantastic!
All the time when you're cooking.
Could you speak up please?
So how long have you known?
Eeee!!! Eee!! Eee!!
Yeah? Are you sure, really.
Well hey, it's just a backup.
God, I wish Mike were here.

Two weeks? That's it?
He just got a divorce right?
It's all right. You can mourn.
Both it is, thank you.
Okay, I'll be out in a second.
I don't want to hear about her!!
And-and a power tie?
There's a skylight?! Wow!!
Maybe they don't trust us.
Hey! Ooh, did you do it yet?
Oh! We could have done that.
Ross, where did you get this?!
Oh you...you made pesto?
See there it is right there.
That would be great. Thank you.
You'd already broken up.
Yeah. Why aren't you with Rachel?
Do you like car games?
Well, if you think it will help.
Seriously, what-what's the part?
Do you have my birth certificate?
Look at you all grown up.
I don't ever want to see you again!
Yeah, is there a hair on it?
I know. I know, what's her number?
Um, not even a little bit.
I'm telling it! I'm telling it!
You should! How is she?
So you're not homesick yet?
Oo, where are the seats?
Hey! Joey! Hey! Hey!! Wow!

Sure it does. Yeah, yeah.
My dear, sweet Rach.
It's ok that's how you feel.
Okay, then maybe I can come too!
Ugh, what's right with them?
You're Frank's best man?!
I knew I should have married Chandler.
Oh, you didn't have to come in with me.
Yeah Joey that is so gross!
Whatever! What about you Meg?
Good. So what were you thinking?
What?! No! It was my idea!
Umm, oh, about three months.
Wow. Where is your luggage?
I licked my arm, what?
Please...wait, how did you do that?
I'm still looking through mine...
Okay, yeah, so it's not gonna work.

It's okay. How's the soup?
That you don't stop talking about it.
All right, so what were you thinking?
So now what's going on here?
No, I can spot you from here.
Can I tell you a little secret?
All right, Joey, same question.
This is everybody. This is Ross.
I can't say because he's famous.
Rachel, what the hell is this?!
Hey Chandler, why so fancy?
Susan, he looks just like you.
Is it an engagement ring?
Y'know she has a face Ross!

It's nice that he has someone.
Okay, thanks. Yeah, I'll try that.
Oooh, yeah. You're a genius.
Does it look like a urinal?
Alright, whadyou do with him?
I-I'm with the umm, the 57th.
Oh-okay, I get the game now.
Oh! What is that? What is that?
You know what, that's it, that's it.
No! Joey, you're going to be great!
Oh we do, but not just yet.
What is this? What's going on?

Hey. So, what did he say?
Where? Ooh, come to Momma.
Okay, but try and get Joey too.
Yeah, complicated 'cause of the love.
Okay, don't freak out. I'll go.
You don't wanna win the lottery?
Oh, this one's for Chandler. Here.
That doesn't lock does it?
Does Joey have any idea?
How can you not know which one?
Yeah, but Jason's really sensitive.
Hm-mm, corn beef.
Hugh! Hugh Grant!
Well, he stabbed me first!!
We should do something. Whistle.
You have got to be kidding me!
My God! What did you order?!
Fun Bobby is so great.
Are you still mad at us?
Break my heart-Oh, all right.
Get your garlic-peelers off me!
Well I hope you have fun tonight.
Chandler, I found the perfect ring.
Because I'm dumping him today.
Boy! I didn't see that coming!
Now, have you told anyone else?
Anyway, I should go. Okay, bye.
So, here we are. Nervous?
That's not how you really feel is it?
Hey. Watcha guys doin?
Well, why are you doing this anyway?
What?! That's the first time today!
Oh my God! How bad was it?
You never run on a barge!
She is so great! I miss her.
Wow! Oh well, I will be there!
I don't know! I didn't come with her!
So? Did you get the annulment?
You didn't get the money, did you?
I know. Hand me a tissue.
Really?! Joey?! You don't say.
I'm just taking it to be re-wired.
No. I've learned my lesson.
Wow, look at these prices.
Yeah! That was so weird, huh?
I wanna hear "The Sound."
I am definitely gonna watch that!
So, um, are you gonna call him?
Is it a meatball sub?
Monica had lunch with Richard.
I hope you were using protection.
Wow! That is a bad audition.
Nooo! Why would you think that?
Oh, look what we almost left.
Why? Why do I have to learn?
Sure! Umm, where are you from?
I, but you're so close! No!
Shh! Get me out of here.
And-and you're using my name!
Oh my god, we killed Bob!
Umm, do you know, umm Sipowicz?
You told them he was missing?
John Glenn is here?!
Oh, I get more because I'm dainty.
Or you can do volunteer work.
Okay, now you're just kinda tidying.
Well, if you don't know I can't help you.
Are you ah, Phoebe Abott?
You're actually going through with this?
My guy has great teeth!
Well, what period is it from?
'Kay, put your head back.
Yeah that's better than my way.
Nah, I don't feel like playing.
So how are things going with you?
No-no, we do it every year!
Oh really? What was your first?
Hey look, you guys, it's snowing!
I'll give you $1 for them.
Everything you've heard is true.
Come on, like you never talk that.
Ooh, the pizza guy's here!
Sure. Yeah, he's kinda sexy.
Wait, you can't take the money out.
Well, this is none of my business.
You have chalk on your face.
Exactly! Because it's in the past!
Oh, that's it? A great idea!
No. No food with a face.
Yeah, just don't get your hopes up.
Oh, I wasn't even thinking about that.
Okay. Hey-Ooh, cool sheets!
I knew it! Because you love Rachel.
So when, when do you leave?
Why would you kill his fish?
How? How is your fault?
Didn't you two already talk?
Oooh. Oh, well this is awkward.
God, that is the nicest kitchen.
Oh! What what what! ...Hi.
What do you mean, comforted her?
Oh, I'm flaky. I'll say anything.
See? This is why you register.
No-no! I-I...I found one.
She wants to meet you in person.
Ooh, you guys have to make a wish.
Oh sure, Cilantro Larry.
Show me the badge again.
Okay Ross! Please don't die!
Oh my God, they took my idea!
Excuse me, is this your car?
Okay, thank you, Mr. Heckles.
Umm, thank you for meeting with me.
Now give me my real gift.
Hang in there, it's gonna happen.
One of the babies is kicking.
Um you, you got a minute?
Oh! Well, if that's what you want...
I would love it if I weren't here!

Half full of looooovvvvve.
And you're so sweet. And you're kind

Have you really done this before?
Monica your remote doesn't work.
Okay, we're on it. We're on it.
Wow! You guys really don't know anything!
No one's here! Oh damnit!
Well, I'm kinda on a clock here.
So, I'm here, ready to play.
You think he's emotionally unavailable?
YEAH...! How great is this...?
OK, OK, don't get all squinky.
Why did you go along with that?
There he goes, your fiance.
Just get your nails done?
No I-I meant your costume.
Oh, he-he can't talk right now.
uh huh how do I look.
I don't use a curling iron.
They have the best stuff in there.
Bamn! There you go! Huh?
Whe-where did he put it?!
I know. This is really, really huge.
Well, I have plans with Joey tonight.
I like our way. Oh! Chess!
I got no sleep last night!
Well, I left my guitar here again.
Yeah, what town are we near?
Oh, Gunther, can I get a scone?
Okay, so how do we decide that?
Wh-why is that the best part?
You're all invited to bite me!
Why don't you play with your roommate?
Yeah, uh-huh, a 100 dollars.
Which proves that I never lie.
Ooh! A Salami Buddy!
Well, that could've been really awkward.
I don't know, you might be the first one.
What? You mean behind my back?
One hundred thousand dollars!
Yeah, swing music is so out.
You completely stole my answer!
Happy thoughts! Happy thoughts!
Fine. Okay, enjoy your concert.
Oh! Here's Joseph Francis!
Hey. Ooh! Don't sit down!
Because I think it means more to you.
No that made me feel precious.
Okay, I'm gonna put this in the car.
Uh huh...we're playing you two.
Bread, so you never go hungry.
Why are you looking at me like that?
Maybe all the rulers are wrong.
I don't even know how that would work!
Alright, here, you have to hold this.
That's a good idea for a business!
On a totally different bet.
Maybe your scene's coming up?
Oh right, maybe I'll just go home.
So was it a lot more money?
I've got friends too. Okay, bye.
I'm having another heart attack!
Oh, what beautiful lukewarm sentiment.
Hey, were the hell have you been?!
You didn't read this one either?!
Oh my God, look! That's Elizabeth!
Not a good day for birds...
Yeah, big guy, kinda bald.
Now, it's you little bunny friend.
A little. Now you're talking.
Oh hey! How was your audition?
I want to see what he wants first.
Wait, does he eat chalk?
Yeah, you're right. How's the Mrs.?
Are you leaving "The Supremes"?
Finger sandwiches and tea.
Sounds like you're a little jealous.
would you call this girl? thanks-fo-r-a-love-ly-even-ing.
So, are you ready to talk about it?
No! No, that you and Rachel are engaged!
God! God! This is not going well.
No, no, he hasn't been around.
Well when can we have this shower?
This is the worst Christmas ever.
Because it's our thirtieth birthday.
All right, I have ya. Oh God.
Mike doesn't ever wanna get married.
What, what are they talking about?
No, I want you to have it. I don't want it.
Uh-huh, great story! I'm going!
No, I'm fine. I'm great. I'm with you.
Yeah, I know! So, what do you think?
You can't give up on your dream.
Umm, Chandler, Monica, this is Don.
Hey, Joey, I got you another present.
No. You're not, you're not stupid.
You missed a belt loop.
Okay, alright, I have a question, then.
Ohhh. Thanks Chandler they're great!
I know! Robin is so gay!
Well, she really wanted to talk to you now.
Well, didn't you just hear what I said?!
Did he go out for a cigarette?
Hey hey hey! She's on!
I know, they're gonna be so happy together.
So, what movie should we see?
Yes! Exactly! And that's why...
Well then, you should look with us.
Ohh, give him a kiss for me!
What are you, what are you doing here?
Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm, who's next?
It's not, it's not very Thanksgiving-y.
Ooh! How was Kathy's play?
No, don't look directly at them!
Bye Chandler! I miss you already.
Does it look like an ashtray?
Theodore... Bitsy... What a delight!
Oh, just go. You're never gonna get it!
so you don't think I'm a total freak.
Oh, just as well, I broke this one.
That is brand new information!!
Why won't you let me massage you?
Shhhhhh! I'm swamped right now.
Really? You're moving on from Ross?
That's all right, that's well, I figured....
Um, Chandler, Ross, this is Robert.
But why does it even matter?!
Listen if you wanna go, just go.
Yeah, it's for our catering business!
And that horrible museum tour!
Listen, I think I've left something here.
I can't believe you... ..did this.
Ooh, I love that place! So, no.
Now you know how you really feel about it.
Maybe, maybe I'll dance for you.
Yeah she said something about crumbies.
Good! Great! You can go first.
Grandma's gonna have to get in line.
Yes, but there isn't always time!
Just, you know, to see... um.
No, but you're questioning my method!
Yeah, we-we feel kinda responsible.
What's the matter? Why so scrunchy?
Yeah, but you have to keep the name too!
Time for your scalp massage!
Hey-ooh so, how was Vermont?
Excuse me. Umm, is Vince here?
So, um, have you told your parents?
Oh look! That guy's peeing!
Wait a minute. What's his name?
What, so what are you gonna tell him?
Yeah! You're such a great friend!
Which you just gave up really quickly.
Come on, there's gotta be something.
Yeah. And, first here's a gift.
He could be in disguise, y'know.
Your middle name is Pamela?
Hell yeah! I'll marry you!
Maybe just 10 minutes for you.
Hey what are you guys looking at?
Oh, are we gonna trash that place?
No, I wasn't gonna ask you that, no.
Okay. Ooh, y'know we could just do this.
Umm, he's here to have sex with you.
It's a Ms. Pac-Man machine!!
Yeah, in the back. You want a quarter?
Oh my god, I'm gonna be on TV!
Yes! She's very excited about that.
Hey, so? Are you gonna do it?
Come on, take 'em off!!
OK honey, you're dating Ross.
That was a test and you just failed.
Yeah? Well this is not what I ordered.
Yeesh, what'd you do about it?
There he is! There he is!
Yeah, y'know, people can be so self-involved.
You-you...you had sex with Ursula?!
Joey, look at me! I'm a nurse!
I'm sorry, I'm with a client right now.
You're kinda stepping on the song.
Well, why don't you just get him fired?
Or you could end up with everything.
Oh, fine! Take his side!
Yeah, I can't say croissant. Oh my God!
We did have fun, didn't we?
So, do you have any other possibilities?
What?! Well he never said that to me!
Ohh, I lost my mom to suicide.
Hey. Ooh, look at you, dressy-dress.
Yes, we should. I think we should.
Your secret bachelorette party...
Okay, but this can't be good for the baby.
I never had a bike of my own.
Nope, not knocked up yet.
My little brother's getting married!!
Ooh, I think I wanna trade circles.
Ohh, ohh, Lorne Green?
Oh, because, you know... they don't like you.
Are you just repeating what I'm saying?
Yeah, I kinda do. Well, how's this?
I can't believe what I'm hearing here...
I'm curious about the human body.
Well why don't you use your key?
Hey will you get me tickets too?
OK. Oh Monica! Guess what!
You must be a fireball in bed.
Would you care to venture one?
Thank you Rachel but, look at Monica!
Jeez, you say one thing, and...
The name was my favourite part!
Okay! Okay! I'm so glad you're here.
Me too! So happy for them!
But we've only had one job.
Bye-bye! That's why I moved out.
Okay, I think I need to do some shopping.
You guys. I'm sorry about your shopping.
Oh my God! Monica's just gonna kill you.
Ohh, the-the Foster puppets!
Umm, I think you're really, really great...
Oh. Ha-ha-ha. All right, anyway...
Umm, yeah, uh-huh, they're implanted.
Good! Good! Five points!
Look, I don't wanna talk about it. Okay?
I don't know. A cowboy theme?
So are you actually gonna see her again?
You're sure? You're absolutely sure?
You don't have to be back for a half-hour!
Yeah. Yeah, that's what you need a good...pill.
Well, tell him, apology accepted.
Alright, no, we could look at them!
I-I wanna be with her, I like her.
It's-it's not negative, it's positive.
Didn't it like totally speak to you?
We stand firm at $10.
Will you get us better gifts?
Do I? Thank you, so do you.
Ohhh boy, do I feel bad.
Well, it's better than us deciding.
And who else is going to be there?
What does she mean by HH?
No don't tear out your eyes!!
I-I sure will, take care.
Thank you. We both forgive you.
Are you asking me to have a frenaissance?
Wow! My breasts are really strong.
Why are you dressed as a gladiator?
Wow! Talking about high maintenance.
She sells drugs to kids.
Alright. So um, stilts huh?
Really? That hadn't occurred to me.
No, but it is fast. Isn't it?
You're still gonna go out with her?!
Shhh! Shhhh! Joey's asleep.
Sure. Do you need some floss?
Hi hi...Oh you have got to sing.
Come on! Look where you are!!
Oh, I wasn't talking about his karma.
So Monica, what were you gonna tell us?
Ohh. No that's okay, he's a friend.
Does, um, anyone wanna see?
Well, then tell him to stop staring!
Oh my God! Chandler just left though!
But I already gave them back to you!
Mon, can I talk to you for a sec?
Monica! I'm sorry I'm late! Monica?
So how was, how was your date?
For God sakes, it's Rachel!
I have liver damage. Ow! Oh!
Open it up, let me see.
Umm, well, umm Grandma died.
Okay, this is from your friend at work.
Oh my God! I love things. What happened?
Well last night, I met Monica's.
It's not Santa's plan. No, it's...
And then... your face is bloated?
See? Vegetarianism benefits everyone.
Relax, it's not like we're forking.
And a small piece of chocolate.
I'm trying to get your parents to like me.
Paolo made a pass at me.
Yes. Did you settle the bill?
Wait! What?! No!! Elevator!! No!
So, what happens to the old guys?
Another lie. You have a sickness!
Russ is Ross. Russ... Ross!
OK, who is the boss of you?!!
Wow, you told your dad the truth.
No. I'm-I'm to depressed to talk.
Because I cared enough to lie!
But again, Simmons. Go on.
Ooh, you nailed the Old Lady!
Well, just buy the damn boat!
Oh, sure! Bye Ross! Forever.
I'm wearing his briefs right now.
Is there anything we can do for you?
Nothing, you just have to be cool with it.
That's too hard. Too hard!
So you do know who he is! Sorry.
I know you didn't, I was talking about Monica.
Hey you guys! Look what I just got.
Ohh, well, you're my lucky penny.
Give her a key to your apartment.
Hi Gram. Whatcha doin'?
Umm, I'm trying to move that pencil.
I don't know, it's such a long trip.
OK, here I go. I'm goin' in.
Okay, well Ross, what is this really about?
Oh, you caught me. I am so busted.
Yeah. The '92 Ross wouldn't.
Hey, do you wanna go to dinner tonight?
Well, I think I can help you get over him.
Hmm, I wonder why. Pervert!
Um-hmm. Oh wait! This is Bonnie.
Living with you would make me happy.
What?! I thought you were crazy about her!
Oh yeah, that's right, the keyboards, huh?
Well, you were wrong, he doesn't like me!
Yeah, she was bald, she's not now.
But Mon, you have to get our money!
Ok, don't get me started on gravity.
Joey, I can't believe you would do that for me.
Bing, what an unusual name.
Well, are any of those people here?!
Nah. I kept myself busy.
I won! I won! I finally won!
So, uh, why didn't you say anything?
I love the license plate game!
Ohh, Monica, I am so excited for you.
Oh, I can't believe you called her fat.
Oh, no wonder I don't feel full.
Oh, he needed some time to grieve.
No! No! I-I meant for the baby!
Shhh!! Please! What's he saying?
No! You should've read it yourself!
Ooh ooh, we have a live one!
He's miserable! What happened to him?
Maybe that's 'cause she's not really gone.
Wow. Okay, I don't know how to talk to you.
Although, don't feel like you can't visit.
Oh! Oh! Oh no!! You swore!
We could have breakfast in bed...
Yeah, I know. It drives me crazy.
How do you even know a woman like that?
Yeah, I locked him years ago!
All right, I'll see you downstairs then.
I could've been killed I hope you know!
Then yes that is what I'm having.
Oh! Ooh! Oh Monica! It's so beautiful.
I don't know. Who's Soupy Sales?
Yeah, not the one I had my eye on.
Who the hell are all these people?
Well, how much do you think he needs?
So-so, what do you want for lunch?
Like a date type person?
So how are things going with Paul?
God Joey, this is taking forever!
Which is why my answer is yes!
Oh, it's Ross on one of his drives!
Yeah. You won't be able to take it.
Maybe, because you told him not to.
Oh, witty banter. Well done.
Okay, well maybe not on those levels.
I know Mike, why don't you keep digging?
Hey Rach, you wanna get some coffee?
Yeah, why don't you just find another apartment?
No! Oh! You're alive! You're alive!
That's weird. I bet they're doing it.
Cups? You're giving me cups?
Isn't it cool! Varoom! Varoom!
Hey, y'know what might cheer you up?
Ooh, wait.. wait, I see a woman.
Oh, got it, stay upwind of me.
Alright, could I just ask you one question?
Um, oh, I got you a birthday present.
My Father is Chuck Magioni?
Look at all the stuff people sent!
Ohh! So, did you get to meet her?
Ok so will he be back soon?
Oh, I hate this. Everything's changing.
Hey, Julie! Hey, how are you doing?
No, but let's come back to that later!
Oh honey no, you ate it all.
Yeah, or, or, or, Mississ-Pete.
You ate meat! You had sex!
So that story doesn't make you cry?
Did I miss it, did I miss it?
Y'know, suddenly I find you very attractive.
Huh. Okay. Well, I'm really happy for you.
You've never asked a guy out?!!
Yeah, this is the guy I was telling you about.
Oh, look, he's got Ross's haircut!
Does anyone wanna watch TV?
Right! Never! Never! I swear!
It kicked! I think the baby kicked!
OK, now I'm gonna kick some ass.
So did you sleep well last night?
Oh no! No! I know how to handle it.
OK, noone is named Sleeve.
Don't you just love the way they talk?!
Good! Good! I was just testing you.
Yeah, I definitely. I don't like the name Ross.
I have to go scream into a pillow.
Oh, I want to look too! . Yikes!
Wow. What are you gonna use it for?
Yeah, I know, but I don't think that means anything.
So uh, now look at the picture...
I brought you my old maternity clothes!
Okay, um, oh, the zoo commercial.
Oh! Ooh! Oh, I didn't know that you did...pot.
Oh now, don't give away the farm!
"Pick up grandma at the airport"?
Forget her! You enjoy this!!
Oh, God bless us, everyone.
Oh my God!! The baby just kicked!
They're not even touching the lasagna!
Ohh. . .K. How come?
Oh! Hello? Yeah this is Phoebe. Really?!
Okay, great so do you want to do it together?
Oooh! You are a very bad man!
Joey, it's Phoebe. Did you stop Rachel?
Remember, a virgin for me please.
Yes, you do. Chandler loves Kathy.
Oh, thank you. Four would be great.
Whoa, what kind of party was this?
Okay, I know. Hold on. Hey Ross?
No Rachel! They got here first!
No, you have to let me in right now!!
Oh we can't, we already have plans.
Have you seen your guy's body?
That's really beautiful. What does it mean?
Guys, the drawing is about to start!
But you-you-you came to see Lilly?
No, I didn't tell anybody that I knew you.
Oh, ok, um, I mean Frank senior.
Wow, Carol really messed you up!
Y'know what, forget it. It's ruined.
Sooo, what's goin' on, huh?
Umm, I think there's something you should maybe know.
Okay. Okay, but you can't fire him today.
Well I'm sorry, I thought you said it was okay.
Y'know what Joey left on my pillow?
All right. Did everyone get out okay?
So how's the piano playing going?
Mike? Okay! What's his last name?
Oh yeah, your microwave. The stereo.
All right, so, so you went to Pete's...
Ooh, honey. You stink at lying.
That won't go with this dress though.
You're right! You're right. Don't say it.
Well, what you're wearing is fine for that.
Come on. It doesn't taste bad.
And a glass of tepid water.
This is terrible, what are you going to do?
Does that mean Carcass is available?
Oh that looks so good, oh I love it.
What's with all the bottles of liquor?
Monica, do you want us to take you home?
I don't know what I'm gonna do about this coat.
Oh my God! I know who the father is...
NO! THEY'RE DOING IT!!!
Ok, you're gonna have to not touch my ass.
Wait, I think I know someone who does that.
Okay, so what do you guys really think of Chandler?
That is so great! Oh, I... Oh my God!
Where are you going, Mr. Suity-Man?
Hi! And you're going into what grade?
Come on, it's not that big a deal!
Umm here's your 3-D glasses.
No that is the last thing you want to do!
I-I-I-I-I don't know, I don't know what to say.
So did Heldi show you the place?
Don't even get me started on yours!
Ohh, he left his cell phone.
And you... Your home is lovely.
No listen to me! She is crazy!
Well at least we know she's a woman.
Oh, hey, Chandler I wanna hug you too!
Oh my god! Shouldn't we stop this?
Are you sure it wasn't an oyster?
Oh! Yeah, y'know you and Ross are still married.
Oooh. Girl's night out indeed.
Okay, we're gonna take a short break.
Oh yeah, like there are police for that!
Calm down. Maybe you're not pregnant.
Okay, we'll talk about something else then.
Ooo, a crossword! Can I help?
Yeah! But I'm a little shaky and nervous.
Good God man don't anger it.
You don't see it? You actually don't see it?
Let's just say, I'm glad I'm not Chandler.
Wait, Rach! Where's the other one?
Ick-neck-tree-anis..... There's a 'g' in there.
Oh no, the dog's not going to be there!
Hey! So Chandler, wanna go to the coffeehouse?
Oh that's a nickname we were trying out.
All right, the seven of us miss you.
But why didn't you just tell her the truth.
God, I hope they kick his ass!
That chick can't handle my corner.
Oh my God!! Excuse me! Excuse me!
Oh my God! Oh my God, we are 31.
Wow, that's close. When's yours?
Ah, Catwoman. So we meet again.
Alright, well, maybe now its not okay.
Yeah, think so. Oh! Huh. Whoah.
Alrighty, here come the water works.
...Then I've already seen this one!
Well then, what about you?! Huh?!
I'm sorry, there's laughing in my head.
Well, I hate to eat and run, but...
Ha-ha, it's not my baby, ha-ha-ha!
Oh, this is it. This what's gonna kill me.
Oh good, oh Joey and Chandler are back.
Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree!
The woman who cuts my hair!
Hey, why are you mopping your ceiling?
Well this doesn't even smell like opium.
Really? Lee Majors is hot!
Sure, oh, is, is Frank home.
No, back to happy. Back to happy!
Well, of course not for tonight. Yeah, hi!
I know. So, what's going on with you and Ross?
How about we talk about this over dinner?
Oh, okay, except I broke up with Roger.
Really? Even more humiliating than.
Okay, here I wish you health and happiness.
Please Rachel, I am not an idiot.
Okay, so it's probably just the Ross thing then.
No, I can handle it. No, I'm a professional.
This pregnancy is throwing me all off.
Everybody looks so happy. I hate that.
Great! Yeah, could you bring me the newspaper?
We could not, would not want to wait.
Regular Celery! Oh, I already have that.
And then for forgetting to invite you to it.
I don't know, I kinda like Bob for a girl.
Oh that's right. You're still set on that?
Wow! That's so great! Oh! Oh! Cougar.
No thanks, I've already seen one.
You know, the asthma guy was really cute.
Wow! Hey, why are you all dressed up?
Ooh, Joey, that's actually a really good idea!
You two will have very hairy children.
Here, look, alright, does this help?
Ok, who wants to hear something ironic?
Monica, Monica, you know what gets out hummus.
Okay. Umm, oh! Okay, I see a circle.
Well not exactly like the one in the poem.
Hey! Don't you give me any of your-Hey!
Oh yeah, so you can walk around naked.
Hey! Oh, how did baby shopping go?
I don't know, I don't have anyone right now. Y'know?
Okay, doctor says any minute now.
But... I'm ready, so, just deal.
Why don't you turn them inside ou...
Woo-hoo, first weekend away together!
Mike, you don't know, you don't know what you're doing!
Hey Monica, what about your extra tickets?
Ahh. OK, let's see yours again.
Oh, some guy she met at the movies.
Oh! No, I-I think I just had a contraction.
Oh, how do you play the shadow game?
You were fantastic! I'm so proud of you!
Nope. Zilch, nothin', uh-uh.
Thank you, very much! Oh! Thank you!
You know, if you want, I'll do it with you.
Wow! I owe Rachel 20 bucks!
Okay, I'm going to take him back to Wendy's.
Oh. No. No. Good! Yeah, me neither.
Ross, how many parents have you lost?
But, your Rachel wasn't whiny enough.
She is so amazing! You have no idea.
Oh, somewhere Joey's head is exploding.
Oh, no, I have the cutest Christmas story!
Oh my God! How did you get back here?!
Oh, okay, I'm sorry, thank you for my azzz.
No-no I can't! I can't let you do it!
You can still sleep at night and stuff.
What?! What do you mean you're going to London?
Oh, it's okay, it was just my left leg.
Oh, you're no ordinary roommate are you?
Sure, what.. what was the work thing?
Great! Okay then it's just us girls!
Umm, hey Rach, can I ask you something?
Oh my God, you've got to stop chattering!
Alright, I'll try, fine! Yes, Okay!
I'm just saying hi! Now I'm gonna go!
Right. Except that I do want to get married.
No! No, the robots just work for them.
Well, what kind of guy are you looking for?
Then why did she ask us to...
Look everyone, it's the spirit of Thanksgiving!
Why not?! Maybe I can, you don't know!
Ewww! Oh! It's the Mattress King!
Joey! Those are my maternity pants!
Oh...yes..is this..umm..Emily's Parents' house.
And also, we don't know what to do with this.
I'm not gonna right to you! That's not real!
It could be like a big giant guy.
The little jail between the doors!
Okay, well you put down the toilet seat.
I didn't know Playboy prints jokes.
No, no, that's the ghost for the attic.
Uh-huh, yeah, that's my cheat sheet.
Ten dollars an hour for what?
Come on, Mom, I'll take you home.
No-no, sorry. Cookies are good, thanks.
Well, you know what, they're our responsibility now.
Listen, I wanted to ask you something about marriage.
So instead you told me Monica was pregnant.
Oh, it's so great to see you feeling like this!
Y'know, it's even worse when you're twins.
Now, we can kick anybody's ass!
Oh! All right. Now, let's not do this!
No, don't-don't say I'm sorry with porn!
You know who shaved you? That was me.
It's okay. Go ahead, ask me out.
Morning. Rach, I'm here with the purses!
That is nice and we're done. TADA!
Noo! But that would've been so cool!
No kind. He just makes it up.
Oh, 19! We thought you said 90!
If she says no, can I have the ring?
No spark? Didn't you sleep together?
Well, I don't think Monica is gonna take this away.
Well then definately don't take his name.
Ooh! So now why can't we tell Chandler?
Wait, wait, why were you at the courthouse?
Well, y'know we don't call it that, but yeah!
So do you want to hang out or something?
Hey! Why are you all red and sweaty?
Ooh, this is it! Oh, that's him! That's him!
By the way, it's a costume party.
You didn't say Boutros Boutros Gali.
Oh no! No God, definitely not jealous!
Oh my God, has she slept at all?
Wow, it's like a dirty math problem.
He seems to hate you. Are you sure?
About how good your cards were.
Oo! Is it for my birthday present?
Oh I know, I helped pick out the ring.
Mrs. Waltham. Hi. It's Phoebe again.
Okay, I asked for the news, not the weather.
It was his sweater, but-Oh my God!
Undo it. Undo it. Undo it.
Oh, that's it? A great idea! Oh yeah.
OK. Um, how come I'm walking with you?
No. This is what I do for luck, ok.
Well did she know you two weren't married?
Yeah, but you shouldn't compare yourself to me.
Well, it's great that you're back! How are you?
No, whad'ya mean? He's not British.
Oh right, because you're so capable of change.
OK, so, you know what you're doing, right?
Oh, yeah try that. So, is that better?
But hes falling in love with her.
You guys make a very attractive couple.
Y'know, me, Rachel, the birds, the babies...
Mate? They're all brothers and sisters.
What happened to the intimate dinner party?
Yeah, you mean like that you're kind of a loner.
You guys, what was the Powerball number again?
Ooh, ooh! Why don't we invite her?
Okay, what about after I give you these candies?
So you still hadn't heard from Emily?
Okay. Oh umm, Chandler, Monica is looking for you.
What?! They took mine to give to you!
Oh, I wish I could, but I don't want to.
Mm-hmm. Throw me a bone here.
Okay. Do you guys want me to play for you?
Shh! Nothing works with this child!
I just lost a whole year of my life.
Uh-huh! Ross invited us all to watch.
Oh God, I really missed that fat bastard!
Op, the ruined quiches are ready.
Great, I'm seeing water rings again.
I dunno, 'cause you're smart, you're funny...
Sorry, I'm so sorry, I will pay you back.
We want the last six years back!!
Uh-oh. She may be onto us.
Wow you guys got a hospital? Fancy!
Oh my God, you're giving your real number.
Okay quick, help me get this off!
Oo! You should have one of us do it!
Yes, it reminds me of a simpler time.
Oh! I won't say, 'no' to a movie!
Oh my God! Monica's gonna totally freak out!
You heard her too?! You have the gift!
Yes, she gives the people what they want.
I..., a jingle? No, no-no-no, no.
Look, why don't you just pay for it yourself?
Okay, what about you? Wouldn't you want a date?
Oh, yeah! No, no, no, no, oh, oh.
Umm, that paper's two weeks old.
No, wait, oh, what are we sorry about?
Can you believe how much this is gonna cost?
I don't know. Ooh! Ooh! Look it! Ah-ha!
Because you would rather live here with Joey.
Yeah! In... really long hour world.
Oh, see, Jack did love the cow.
Did I use that already today? I'm sorry.
Okay, cancel backup! Cancel backup!
You wanna work on your interview skills?
Good. I should really start wearing hats!
Oh, exellent. Everyone was so, so nice.
Ok, well, are all the tickets in the bowl?
Ahhh!! Chandler and Monica!! Chandler and Monica!!
Oh my God, oh my God! Poor Monica!
I'm sorry, I can't do this. I'm not an actor.
Thank God, 'cause that hair on a baby...
Please don't leave me, I'll be lonely.
All right. Well, don't worry, I call shotgun!
Hey Mike, what's the capital of Peru?
Yeah, okay let's leave these two alone.
Yeah, ok. You probably did everything you could.
Ooh! Bath salts would be nice.
Well, I can't work with people who would do this.
Oh, look, he's closing his eyes again.
Taffy, really? I've never had any.
I already had a baby. Leave me alone.
All right, c'mere, gimme your feet.
Oh no. Did umm, did she say why?
See, there you go, the cleansing works!
No, just a regular old flying dwarf.
Oh, Paolo, hi, what are you doing here?
Yeah, but then I can be you sidekick Vunda.
Look at you! How, how do you feel?
Oh, I don't know. I mean it was fun one time.
I worked in a Dairy Queen, why?
Oh, hey, Monica, I brought back your iron.
You want it there? You take it there baby!
Okay! I just-I didn't know that you are a lesbian.
Were you guys making fun of Parker?
You're not? See, that's why you're so great!
Would you say your pesto is the best-o?
Oh, she sees him! Oh, they're hugging!
Oh! Okay! Yeah, that's okay. Have a seat.
Yep. Put more gas in.
We have good news, look whose back!
It's a normal Swedish name... Ikea...
Yep! Okay, gotta go, talk to you later.
Ow! My ass. Okay. Okay. Oh, shhh!
Wanna see mine, wanna see mine?
Here it comes. Our first kiss.
Oh my God! I'm sorry, too soon. You go.
They've been quiet for a long time.
Ah! Oh my God! You r-r-rotten boys!
Don't worry, we'll find you someone else.
Yeah, except your breasts look kinda small.
OK, Rachel, why don't you start talking first.
And um, and there's actually a, a woman?
No problem! Next week: stealing...
Hey, look who's up! How do you feel?
That's fine, just don't bring it in my mouth.
Okay. Is it a kind of hot sandwich?
The Police? Here? A reunion?!
Your knuckles are kinda hairy too...
No, not wieght... y'know, more like insulation.
Okay. Umm, ooh, ooh-oh, I have a game!
We could eat the wax! It's organic.
Hey, excellent, excellent water-table thing.
Hmmm? Yeah. So, um, is she fat?
Oh yeah, you're solid. Yeah, you're just no me.
What are people having, the garlic Martini?
Most likely. Okay, I'm gonna be out there.
Great! It worked! No one's sad.
Oh, yeah, sure. So, how was your day?
Wow! How long were we arguing for?
Well, that's not something a girl wants to hear.
I don't know, I hardly ever say that about people.
So your brother's straigh huh? Seriously.
Yeah, not in your case Lovey Loverson.
Hornswoggle? Ooh, this must be killing you.
How-how about you each get five vetoes?
Y'know, there's gonna be lots of other stuff.
Ok, so I guess we don't invite her parents.
Oh he knows! For the most part.
No. 'Cause you need that. No, it's okay, thanks.
Yeah? Okay, I think I'll play it at the wedding.
Y'know? Ooh, you can almost smell the opium.
Didn't you like, just get your eyes checked?
Well, I-I wasn't hopping mad, y'know.
Then I'm gonna have to ask you to keep it down.
But people that you don't know and will never see again.
They're gonna get through this, aren't they?
Whoa! Why do you get to answer the door?
The coins have finally forgiven me!
Damn you Monica Geller hyphen Bing!
So... What's the deal with umm, you and Joey?
Oh, no! I- I can't drink this now!
Well, if you really, really want it, then it's okay.
And you thanks for the face massage. Thank you.
Mon', not that you didn't sound good, but...
Yeah okay, no if it helps you okay. Yeah.
I'd say that chair's taking the brunt.
Everyone. Except for uh... no everyone.
No! No, she said you actually proposed to her.
You! An actor?! That's madness!
Wow! I didn't know you guys actually used those.
Hey! Ooh! How was teaching last night?
Oh, I have a headache. A horrible headache!
Um, um, Rachel can we talk for a sec?
Is anyone else starting to really like him?
Oh. Oh! Ma'am? Excuse me, ma'am?
Isn't there a national football league.
Oh, wait, wait. Clogs, or claws?
Look everybody, look at my new dollhouse!!
It's okay. What the hell took you so long?
Then it's really too bad that you can't tell me.
All right, stop it, you're freaking me out.
Wait a second! So, what's new with you?
Yeah! Now, why do you want to kill yourself?
Hey, do you need to get in? Here you go.
Oh that'd be me. Sir. After you.
Hey. We found her, we found the girl.
No...I really wanted to know how you feel about it.
Ah! Okay so that would make me Susan.
Oh, is that who the monkey's named after?
Oh, so they owe me like, three Phoebes.
What else do they add smell too?
Actually, it makes us feel that big.
Oh, hi Max! Hey, do you know everybody?
Yeah, it's... Y'know there's-no you may not!
I thought you said you read it in high school.
Does anyone want the rest of this Pop-Tart?
Why? Why would you wanna... do that? Why?
That you like, we get it. You like her. Great!
So is Joey going to have to give up the apartment?
Uh-oh. It's Scary Scientist Man.
Okay, I'll do it, but just these three, right
Hey Leslie, how'd you know I'd be here?
I don't know about that. I've got one that's worse.
Hey now you have two. Oh, now you have two.
I'm so embarrassed, I'm the one he hit on!
Oh, okay. There should be Gold Man!
Umm, is-is that because you're out of toner?
Are you gonna open the presents without Chandler?
Well you obviously didn't see Chucky 3.
I really, really enjoyed it. Very exotic.
God, what a great day. ...What? Weather-wise!
Absolutely, oh I promise. Tell her what?
Well, y'know I'm wearing layers and it's warm.
What about Glen? He could be a Glen.
I'm gonna get some coffee, anyone want anything?
I'm sorry, I broke down... I wanted to see him.
I can't believe you're gonna ask Monica to marry you!
It's so obvious, why doesn't he just ask?
Marcia and Chester are mad at Phyllis.
Ooh, ooh, did you ask Stacy Roth?
Umm, look it, you-you can't kill yourself.
No, I mean I was really acting my ass off.
Oh, I am sorry but I am incredibly talented.
No offense, but that sounds nothing like her.
No. I'm just, I wanna, I need to be alone.
OH!! MY EYES!!! MY EYES!!!!
Why, so he can get mad at the baby?
Wow! I cannot believe Mark asked you out.
Oh right, like they're gonna let me have a passport.
Since when are you into swing music?
I'll have one, please. Plus my money.
Easy. Step. How did it get on?
: Oh I see, so then, you were lying.
Sure! Yeah! Las Vegas, number one!
Hey you guys! Ok, we've got great news.
Yeah, we both can. And we both will.
You guys, why didn't you tell me you were eloping?
You see? Nothing is good enough for her!
Oh, okay. Feel better, Rachel, 'kay?
Have umm, have you thought anymore about you and Rachel?
Hello? Yes, I'm the one who found your phone.
I wonder where she is. That is so weird.
So... now... What about with Mike's mom?
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm just a little nervous.
No but you shouldn't! Don't ever do that again.
Not even if you just pretend that it's milk?
Then that's not breaking the law! I'm there!
Breaking up sucks! Oh, I really miss Mike!
North route or south route?
OK, I can be a waitress, I can be a waitress.
Well, it's just that maternity clothes are so expensive.
What? What happened to the window in the attic?!
You don't have to put a good spin on everything.
Turkey's are beautiful, intelligent animals!
I think on some levels she already knows.
Ah-hah! At least we know it's a him.
There is a speakerphone on the base unit...
Hey, do you think this is why Chandler took off?
Great, let's begin. How's the pressure?
Great! Ok...I'll go get the tube top.
Look out, incoming pumpkin pie!
Hold it! N.Y.P.D! Freeze punk!
Oh, I can't believe you guys lasted a whole year!
Nothing, I'm sorry, I'm just, I'm out of sorts.
Ohhh! My God! For tiny salt!
Oh come on, they can be in the same room.
Ursula! Wait! Err-err, it's me! Phoebe!
Ohh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. You'll get your turn!
Okay well, he would turn things to gold.
Maybe you need to spice things up a little.
Got it! It... It's hard to stop...
Hey. Oh thanks for the great movie tip.
You're right, you're right. Ah, you are so yumm.
Maybe we can like go to a movie or something.
Oh, alright, that's it, now I have to go see him.
Oh, you make sex noises when you get massaged!
Wait, wait, remember when my water broke?
Okay. Oh my God! What did I ever do to you?!
But, it's not like we're losing anything. Y'know?
Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew!
Hi! Okay, Monica, Rachel, this is my friend Roger.
I can't do that. I'm an actor. I have a process.
Yeah, I really liked that fighter pilot one.
Oh, Ode To A Pubic Hair?
Oh yeah you were helpful! Yeah, no, thanks you.
Well, he was a he in Arthur, and in Ten.
What... I could, I could do it. What is it?
And do you know what girls are really good at?
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't hear you over all the winning.
Oh you did? He did it! He did it!
I can't, I have to take my grandmother to the vet.
Hey you guys I'm gonna go out and take a walk.
Listen umm, yeah okay, I need to talk to you!
What time? Maybe we can share a cab!
Rachel! Come on out! Monica made breakfast!
Y'know she might not even notice he's gone.
All right, so, what are we supposed to call you?
Umm, yeah, I'd like to go out with you officer...
Yeah, but not as good as batch 17.
Whoa-whoa-whoa, you guys, do you know anything about chicks?
And because you're both, you know, white women.
I don't know. I-I think it's still gonna be a while.
Yeah, I feel great. 'Cause we're moving in together.
I-Rachel, you can't go! Ross loves Emily!
Joey. You know, um, he's really nutsy about you.
Is that a real place? Are they hiring?
Oh that's good, the chemistry thing for us too.
Okay, this will keep them away from your stuff.
So Chandler, I-I'd love to come by tonight.
Yeah, and nobody slept with that Xerox girl.
Yes, yes! Like the man in the shoe!
No, but it sounds like it was fricken funny...
Oh, okay. Listen, thanks for everything, Mon.
Um, were you planning on kissing me ever?
Oooh, so so so, did you read the book?
Listen, sorry about your death, that really sucks.
Oh Rachel, this is all so 'Papa don't preach.'
OK, Monica? I had another answer all ready.
500 bucks at a flea market?!
Oh, we were just trying to make Joey feel better.
Yeah I know, it was my candle. My candle!
Well, I bet that was very hard for him to do.
Huh, I might be losing interest in this.
All right-Ooh! Oh dead God, save me!
Uh huh. But they're not your friends anymore.
Ear plugs, or cloves of garlic?
Seriously, I don't Rachel's gonna think it's a good idea.
Monica! That's not right! Start with where.
Hey, thank you so much for these tickets, Chandler.
Okay. If you're alive you answer your phone!
OK, so what, you're just never gonna see him again?
Yeah, I'll do that. So who gets to be yours?
Oh no, let her stay out there. It's sweet.
They're here already? How are they doing this?
You're not the only one who has a date tonight.
Sting has a son that goes there too!
So-so how long did that last for you and Chandler?
Hi Geller-Bing residence. How can I help?
Oh, you like that? You should hear my phone number.
Oh, yeah, they're falling in love all over again.
A-Allright, well... I'll call the cab company.
Cool Aunt Phoebe. I am pretty cool!
Hey! You were really great! You were really, really great!
Uhu, uhu... and why do you think that is?
I'm sorry I have friends outside the six of us.
It's fun, God I love how sexy I am.
Being pregnant is tough on your tummy.
Uh-huh, and a little seed money for the party.
About 20 minutes. CLOSING CREDITS
Oh no wait, I'm sorry, that's 'pretty dumb.'
Okay, don't give me a reason to get mad, okay
Ohh, okay, they gave you the old time pricing.
What?! Oh my... Oh my God!! What happened?!
Oh, thank you! Oh... Oh my God, you're RICH!
I just wanted to see what all the fuss was about.
So, Sebastian, do you do any volunteer work?
Can you totally see through her shirt ?
No. Here. There. Ooh, double sixes.
Joey, why did you set me up with a stranger?
Come on, give me something. What's his name?
Hmm, they just don't make 'em like that anymore!
Oh no not that guy there. That guy right there.
Well, what am I gonna do? I really need my guitar!
Come on Mon, let her throw the ball.
You can't put your cigarette out on a tree!
Yep, and that's why we don't invite you to play.
Oh that's so great! Ohh, so what's going on now?
No idea! I though he was soft like you!
Yeah, well me too, yeah. I think that's the challenge.
Yes. Well, that's neither here nor there.
Right- where we've been looking all night!
'Hey! You're not dead! Okay, see ya!'
Oh hi Ben-No!! Don't look at the machine!
Just don't. Look at this funky shirt!
So. You two are totally into each other.
Not really, I got to drag him around too!
I just wish they'd realise they should be together.
Well at least I got these sheets for Ross.
After that? Yeah! No, I mean if I can help.
Hello Chandler, lovely day huh? You!
Ok. Listen, just don't say anything about me, ok.
That's so great! 'Cause you already know how to do that!
I dunno. I don't feel like kissing anyone tonight.
See? This is exactly why you shouldn't lie!
And Tim I just wanna say, good luck here.
And! She uses sex as a weapon!
You are really good! I play a little guitar myself.
Ross! How could you do that to an old man?!
Excuse me, Ross, old friends catching up.
I suppose I could tell her it's just all my fault.
But great news about the apartment pants, huh?
Okay, I knew I should have had this conversation with Joey.
I can smell it a little, bake the pie.
Hey. I need an atlas! I need an atlas!
Yes! You mean the world the world to me. Oh...
All right fine! This looks like so much fun.
Get your foot off my contestant! Judge!
Yeah, we all know! We talk about it all the time!
Ohh, I think she knows where my Dad is.
How long has it been since you had sex?
Oh God, Korea is such a beautiful country.
Oh! The yuk! Ross, he's doing it again!
Am I crazy or does this totally go?!
Well then get your money back and return them!
Hey. Ooh Ross! How'd the conversation go?
Hey! I brought you some house warming gifts.
Yes you can! Sting says so himself!
Umm, do health inspectors work on commission?
Oh, how was last night with Julio, senorita?
No, no, no, no, no, no. Yeah, could I just?
Ok Rachel, make a special flan wish.
Ok. Um, so does your guitar have a strap?
Now, are you sure you don't want to go see a doctor?
Oh, all right. Oh! Look what we almost took!
: Your Visa bill is huge!
Okay so, by melting, you meant melting.
Come on, seriously! When did it end?
Wait a second, or maybe you can go in first.
But at least the apothecary table is real.
You didn't leave lipstick marks on the phone.
No, I felt it on my hip. You could tell.
Wow! And hey, it's cool if you're a lesbian!
Doy! Probably right before she lost it!
Got cha again, you guys are so easy.
You ask an intriguing question Chandler Bing.
If you could do that, I'd marry the hippity-hop.
That's a dog, every house should have a dog.
Why?! What's happening to the coffee house?! Oh!
Okay. Come on! That's not running! Let's go!
Fine! Here! Take a hike toots!
Of course not, because you're in love with her.
Joey, why don't you talk to Chandler about moving back?
Cassie, are you finding everything okay in there?
Do you think they have yesterday's daily news?
In my day, divorce was not an option.
Everybody, this is Parker, Parker this is...
But somehow you came off as the bad guy.
Hey! What's up? Oh my God! What am I doing?!!
I'm sorry, it's just, I'm a little short on cash.
This is so fun. All right, what do we do now?
Oo, this is a big one. Eww! Arghhhh!!
So what do you guys want for an engagement present?
Ok, we're taking that paddle home, mister.
All right, forget it, nevermind, you can have mine.
We're moving in together! Isn't it great! Yay!
Hey. Here. Ohh, who's the silver fox?
Awww! Now you're just my annoying friend Chandler.
Rach, it's gonna be okay! You guys are the best!
You were great. But they still made fun of you.
Okay, watch, learn, and don't eat my cookie.
This is my father, this is a picture of my dad.
Oh, I love paper mache! What did you make?
So, he a little enthusiastic, what's wrong with that?
My songs aren't good enough for your restaurant?
Well, some things are just hard to say to your face.
Joey! Wow, you didn't rip off any buttons.
Oh my God! I do love you! How did you do it?!
Oh my God! Go away! Stop looking in here!
Okay, yeah. Triple A can pick us up.
I can't believe you tried to move the green ottoman.
Okay, a meat eater. Fine, that's one for you.
How are you? Good. Hi, thanks for coming.
Oh my God!! You threw Pepper on the fire!
No, now I feel bad. You wanna go to the concert.
Well, maybe you wouldn't have had you run in the chapel!
Hey, are you going to find out the sex of the baby?
Oh! I'm a masseuse. I give people massages and stuff.
Hey! Can we pick up where we left off?
Oh, what was that for? Like a bake sale?
Ohh! We went to a self-defense class today!
Oh my God! I don't believe it! Oh, you poor bunny.
Oh Joey, I'm so sorry. You want some of my breakfast?
Hey!! Get your ass back here, Tribbiani!!
Hey, Mel Gibson and Clint Eastwood.
All right, hold on! Okay, let's just all think.
Oh good! Okay. 'Cause you were acting like you didn't.
Could you-could you umm, give us one second?
...DUMB, DRUNKEN, BITCH!!! Thank you, thanks.
You've lasted a whole year. Good for you.
Ooh, great! Just the reaction I was hoping for.
Sorry, mix up. Hey, how was the movie?
No, what's more important, your friends or money?
Oh, it's incredible! I so want to be a Waxine girl.
Oh you'll probably take care of that on your hands.
Alright, now I will let go if you both stop.
Y'know, you are 12 years older than her.
Ooh, where are you off to, Travelin' Jake?
Oh, this life! Oh okay no, Chandler's is worse.
Oh my God! I can't believe my little brother is married!
Never mind. But it was going to be really good.
It's not all mine. We all get 50 cents.
Okay! All right! Yeah! 'Cause I just can't picture it.
Hmmm... No, no... No, I can't do this. It's bad.
Yeah that was lucrative! Smart like your brother!
Oh God. So-so you're making porn movies.
Very good handshake, good wrist action.
Ugh. Come on, Mona, don't kiss ass.
No look, I-I'm sure that people know you exist!
Oh, well he's yummy. We did a little kissin'.
Oh, I thought you weren't coming. What? Where were you?
Look, I'm talking right now! You're-you mean her.
Well, I have ah, vodka and cranberry juice.
Well, if you really wanna know, I'm-Oh! I can't tell you this.
You didn't notice she was wearing different clothes?!
Ohh, yeah. I think his exact words were...
Well, I guess they're not coming. You wanna just order?
Ooh, it's sympathy pains. Ohh, that's so sweet!
Wow! Could everyone totally see up his robe?
You know, I think I want to write a song about all this.
Yeah, after this, I think he'll be doing that himself.
Okay! All right, let's start with the handshake. Hi.
Uh-huh. You've met your match Rachel Green.
Oh, it's like the mother ship is calling you home.
Well, they fired me and I'm having heart attack.
Y'know! You don't make a very good first impression.
Oh my god. How many of those have you had?
Oh absolutely. Shall we say, around seven?
Okay. Yikes! That one doesn't look very fulfilled.
Who would you rather sleep with Monica or Rachel?
Yeah. That's fine. That's fair. Is it Tag?
Oh Rach, good, listen isn't this perfect for me!
But, also, what happened between you and your Mom?
You mean the chocolate chip cookie recipe?
...I feel a little sneezy And now I-
Let's try something else, let's play a game.
Oh, well... 'cause.... you just... I don't like this question.
Ohh! Okay, I'm going to have to kick her ass too.
Okay I can't let you do this! She's lying to you.
Yeah. Salt, so your life always has flavor.
All right, me too. Should we wake her up?
Because it was fate that made me call you today!
No-No! You need your sleep. Night-night! Shh!
So Ross, how umm, how did it go with Bonnie?
That's she's like the daughter she never had. Listen!
Okay. Oooh! Oh, this is our last huddle, yeah.
No, yeah! The groom cannot see the bride!
You've got to get out of here! Save yourself!
Well how would you know?! You didn't even read it!
Chandler sucks! He couldn't have gotten this good!
I will replace it, I promise. I feel so terrible.
Oh my God, he's lost it. He's totally lost it.
Okay, Seasons Greetings and everything, but still...
Oh, hello, kettle? This is Monica. You're black.
Hold me close, young Tony Dan-za.
Yeah, so please, please, please, don't say anything to Chandler.
Yeah, I know, I do that 'cause it makes me look taller.
I don't. He got...he-he-he-he's hit by a bus.
That's not Ralph Lauren. Sounds like him though.
Well you know, you juist, you eat them and you can tell.
Yeah, so... They gotta die someday. HELLO!
He's just such a great guy I'm so excited about him.
Ohhh... Sure, yeah... ..okay, it fits.
How can you let him talk to your crotch like that?
oh umm Mike's picking me up for a date.
I'm not writing about you! I'm writing about other people.
Hey Joey, y'know what? You are way to good for her.
I've never been more convinced of your love for her.
See, that just means it's working. Does this hurt?
Um, yeah sure. Why you wanna call your Mom?
Of course they do! Or I'm just really hungry.
Well just figure out a way to talk him out of it.
I miss Janice though. "Hello, Chandler Bing."
Oh, okay, see? Things are looking up already!
Chandler, I-I will handle this! How much is it?
Um, we went shopping for um, for, fur.
Okay. Okay, you don't have to walk behind me any more.
well, this is, this is, this is not over! Hello?
Okay, those are my sunglasses, you borrowed them from me.
Oh. Okay. Oo, sorry I acted like a bank.
That's nice. I like having things to read in the bathroom.
Ooh, ice! I am so in the mood for ice!
Oh? And how will you know what time to come over?
How long did you think this barbecue was gonna last?
Well you said that he's paying the people who are playing.
Rachel Karen Green, where's the other earring?!
Well, you could use your position y'know as the roommate.
Rachel, we're sorry for pushing those guys on you.
Okay, obviously you don't know much about the U.S. government.
Ok well give her a chance to see all of that!
Rach, so, that guy there. Straight or gay?
Hey Rach, will you come with me to a dressing room?
And, and then I got uh, these are apartment pants.
Wait you stole those from these people's wedding?
Thanks. Okay, now go away so we can talk about you.
See, this is exactly what we do not have time for.
Oh, look, twins. Hi, guys. Oh, cute, cute.
Yeah, um, I can't fly. I'm having my brother's babies.
Oh no wait no, this is wrong! Ross isn't here!
Do you want me to teach you? I'm a great teacher.
But umm, I mean, did you talk to them about, y'know...
Wow! What an incredible violation-and wonderful surprise.
Just wanna check my horoscope, see if it was right.
Ooh, what a great table! Where-where did you get it?
To see if know what these guys are talking about.
So what were you doing out there, do you not like Charlie?
If it was, would you stop hanging out with her?
She cancelled! My namesake cancelled on me!
Ooh, look at you fancy lads. What's the occasion?
So you guys'll stay here and hang out with me?
Well tell that to them. Oh! You can't, their dead.
No, that would be, "Why are you being cute?"
Something just brushed up against my right leg!
Make sure you check Chandler's jewelry box.
Okay! Thanks! Happy Holidays, here's your joy.
Hey! Hey, did you get your invitation to Ross's wedding?
I'm kind, caring, and sweet. What's Monica like?
Yeah! Oh, c'mere, Marcel! Oh, Marcel, c'mere!
You saved them! You guys! Oh God, you're the best!
Oh, you guys! We've got to keep all the tickets together.
Wow! You really go all out when you're expecting company.
Hey, oh, so, um...how'd you make out last night?
Okay. Wait, do you know how you're going to stall her?
Come on Joey, don't make me feel badly about this.
Oh, I wanna see! Lemme see! Lemme see!
Yeah, or you know, you could just wish that I didn't have them now.
Where is everyone? They're forty minutes late.
Hey lady, your day's over! It's my turn!
Oh, I'm Phoebe Buffay. I'm one of Ross's best friends.
I picked her! Oh thank God you want her! Ooh!
No, I like him a lot but I don't think I'm ready for this!
Umm, she said she'd be back December 26th.
Oh, you Americans always butcher the French language.
Y'know, I dunno who this is, but it's not Debbie.
I'm almost done with it, keep your panties on.
Oh my God, that's so freaky! Turn him off!!
I'm having another heart attack!! Call 9-1-1!!
So you wouldn't mind if he was dating someone else?
I didn't even think about that! Aaargh, sexual politics!!
Really? Not even to, um, change his PAJAMAS?!
Oh some guy from my gym. A little annoying.
I know but I'm having so much fun doing good deeds.
All right. I gotta go. I have break up with Vince.
You're the most beautiful bride I've ever seen.
Yeah that's Rachel. Beat me over the head with it.
Wait! Maybe, maybe you're overreacting! You do that y'know.
You guys, I'm sorry, could you please talk a little slower?
Joey stuffing 15 Oreos in his mouth.
Yeah that's right you are so busted. Book 'em.
Well, how-how-how is that possible? You barely know her!
I-I-I'd love to. Let me just tell my friend.
I know, you must've won like a contest or something!
Yeah. I just need you to bring me some photos of Ross.
Oh, you say someone's name enough, they turn around.
I know you're just moving uptown but I'm really gonna miss you.
Any chance Charlie has a deaf twin?
Popes in a Volkswagen! ...I love that joke.
So um, so what's up, you came to see me yesterday.
Ooh, oh no! I have to go! I have a massage appointment.
Yeah, y'know what, there are other fish in the sea.
I don't know. I haven't been out on a date in so long.
Wait-wait-wait, wait! Puppies. Cute or ugly?
yea you know you are a bit of a drama queen.
Now do me, do my back. Oh come on, harder.
So how is this for our big double date tonight?
And Joey, get me a bottle of wine and glasses?
Wait. Really?! 'Cause mine get me out of tickets.
He's not backing down. He went to get lotion.
Uh Joey, we're trying to dial down the crazy.
So, did shopping make you feel any better about Ross?
I can say I told you so but she's kinda doing that for me.
Oh yes, I see what you mean. That look is priceless.
That was the best part? Good honeymooning tiger.
Hi Phoebe Abott, I'm your best friends daughter!
Oh, look at little Leslie stretching in her sleep.
Okay. It's exactly how I'd imagined it would be.
Hey. I'll be right back. I've got to go to the bathroom.
What are you two girls whispering about over there?!
Yeah, I know. It's a real mustard-tastrophe. Can you help me?
Oh my God, I remember now! We were playing chess!
Well, not much has changed in the last five minutes.
You know... You're gonna be really, really hard to get over.
Oh, good!Ok, good for you!Try to recapture the magic!
Yeah, and y'know what? I don't give a tiny rat's ass.
Hi, sorry I'm late, I couldn't find my bearings.
I wanna see what's in your hand. I wanna see the trash.
Actually I said she abandoned me to write jingles.
Well, I never knew mine. Do you remember what it is?
Oh well, lost again. That's it! You and me, outside!
Although he does play with himself in his sleep.
Yeah, I might have said yes, but that would have been wrong.
Ohh knockers will help us figure it out.
Hey! You could do a lot worse than Joey Tribbiani!!
Which would you rather be a fireman or a swimmer?
Wow! Well, if you nail the interview, you'll get it!
Wow! Okay, dude alert! And who is this guy?
Joseph Francis Tribbiani are you home yet?!!
So you hired yourself a little treat did ya?
Oh, Boy Scouts could've camped under it!
Hey the wedding is so close! Are you getting nervous?
I can't believe this! How long as this been going on?
Yes. Yes I am. Oh my God, I'm gonna have a baby!
Excuse me, I don't want Greg and Jenny's rejects.
Oh I know, I've been there. I remember toward the end...
That wouldn't stand in the way of a true pianist.
Oh, boy scouts could have camped under there.
Yeah it is! It is! It's freshwater eel!
Hey! Do you want do you want a little taste of Pheebs?!
Yeah, but you kinda knew that something was going on, didn't you?
Of course you don't sweetie. You're brand new.
Oh, yeah. That is not true. Ross, is this your fantasy?
Y'know none of my other student thought I was stupid.
Okay, good. There you go. Doesn't anyone feel better?
Based on this play? ...Based on this play!
Embryossss? As in, "More than one?"
Hey-Ooh, how's Hilda? Is she working out?
And! Whoever finds it wins the prize!
Wow! Nice! Manly and also kind of a slut.
Okay, I can do that! Oh, by the way, I love my office.
What? Oh. Ooh. Whoa! That one kept going.
For what? I can't believe this! I gotta get out of here.
No, huh uh, no way, I'm sorry, not gonna happen.
Well, I mean, then what happens if it doesn't work out?
No-no-no! We haven't started yet. Where's Alice?
Hey, does Monica know about her broken plates yet?
No, I really wanna live with you! I wanna move in with you!
But what about all the "finding-his-flaws" stuff we've been doing?
Hey! Ooh, wow that jacket looks great on you!
He's right though, the '74 is absolute piss.
Yeah! Okay-ooh, but are you going to have time to read it?
Oh my God, you guys are selling the entertainment center?
Umm, not without you, lover. So, this is my bra.
Oh, hey, y'know what? Tell them that bone story.
Oh, right, so he gets a little crazy when he's stoned.
You should be. I'm very bendy. I'm gonna kiss you now.
Oh, the Angelica!! Go! Go! You didn't get the annulment?!!
You know you should go outside and be with the three-dimensional people.
Well actually, I know what time Chester and Marcia said.
Yeah. So um, did he ever talk about me, Phoebe?
Ohh, let me see it! Let me see your hand!
Look, can't we just say that you believe in something, and I don't.
Oh, hey, look, I found coffee! Okay, let's skedaddle.
Well, I guess we'll just have to put the wall back up.
Yeah, uh-huh, there was nothing. Can I get some water?
No I just, just wanted to know who he was, ya know.
Eww! Oh, it's all dirty. You should throw this out.
Y'know, just some good faith money to hold the date.
Yep, lipstick and a daughter, big day for you!
Wow! I didn't see that coming! You're-you're asking me out!
Oh, okay, I don't know what you just said, so let's get started.
No, I got in trouble for that before. I'll see you later.
Yes, hi, Mr. Adelman. Thanks for meeting me.
Well yes Rachel but you got something so beautiful out there.
I can't believe you didn't tell me there was a suicide note!
All right well, we're just gonna have to tell Monica, that's all.
Umm, no, it's a purse. And there's a thermos in it.
What's the big deal? I did it at Monica and Chandler's!
Because, every time I go to the dentist, somebody dies.
Yeah and I-I found you one too who is not a weirdo.
Are these for rent! I thought people were just bragging!
Ooh, I'll go in on that with you! I couldn't think of anything.
Joey's having a party and he wasn't gonna invite us?
Yeah! No, that's right. And I thought it was a really good idea.
Really? That's the thing I'm worse at! You'll see.
This is so typical. I'm always the last one to know everything.
Well, no no, you have to stay back. I, I have the pox.
Well, I thought you loved her when you-when you married her.
I think David would probably wanna hear a few lectures.
Three? You guys were worried I wouldn't even have one!
That's right, I don't... But I was, I was drunk on you!
Oh okay. All right, then I need to calm down a little.
Oh really? She said she wants to go away with you?
So what?! That doesn't give you the right to ditch me!
Oh yes, no, Richard would never steal your wind.
Yeah, well, y'know maybe you just need to try a little harder!
No, I know. That's a part of the whole, you know, them-not-liking-you-extravaganza.
This is nice. We never do anything just the two of us.
Yeah, do you want to break a dying woman's heart?
Oh! Joey uh, were you in our room last night?
And that's Judy over there at the bar with Emma?
Oh, Rachel and I have appointments to get our hair cut.
Oh, I tasted Ben's milk, and Ross freaked out.
Ross, you can't tell her not to go. You just started dating.
Everbody this is Frank! This is my half-brother Frank.
And I just wanted a new daddy for Davy and Becky.
Get out of here you lurker! Go on! Get!
Yes! Yes you can, I'm looking for Jack's parents.
Um, a chip. A tattoo, I'm getting a tattoo.
Just for the future, this is hardly a commercial for it.
Oh, in that case--Yay! That was me hopping on board.
Plus that shirt doesn't really match those pants.
So that's why she gave you a naked picture of herself.
Are you sure? Because I'm really dreading going to this party.
Why? The only person my playing is bothering is you!
Wow, kids. Frank, are you sure you're ready for that?
He is! But he's getting divorced-Ross! Maybe you know him.
That game should not be played without my supervision.
I know, I'm sorry, please forgive me. I don't know what to say.
Okay, see, see, everyone else is happy she's done.
So that's what you thought I did!! God! That's not what I do!
Okay, but you cannot tell him... but look whose back!
I can't believe he taped the two of them having sex!
Oh please, somebody tell me I don't have to go to work today!
Alright Monica, if there is something that you would like to share...
He said you poked at him with wooden spoons.
Ooh, ooh, fun! Okay... um, Liam Neeson.
Oh, well, see, there's this guy she met at the...
It's a Wonderful Life. Yes I've heard of this.
Y'know, dirty talk, mnage trois, toys...
Okay. Whoa, sorry. Why were you just like all in the dark?
Your welcome, oh please not the one with the turtles.
Well, I made you a candle light dinner in the park.
She's made it pretty clear, it is not going to happen.
Okay then I don't have a choice! I have to buy that lamp!
How could you not tell Mona that Rachel is living with you?
Oh, do you need a hug? You don't have to bring me anything!
Hmm, did you talk to Gary about the moving in thing?
Yeah, but I-I-I-I can do that for you, I'm gonna do that for you.
But you would have so much fun and you have a really nice voice.
What? Is it - is this 'cause of what Ross said?
Thank you. No? All right. Oh, it's so nice to see you.
Hey, maybe they meant to write, 'Quiet, bitch.'
He said: Are you seeing someone? And I said no...
No, not usually. But yeah, I could use one right now.
Well, I'm not gonna be the only one who's not getting paid.
Do you think that's something that he'd be mad at you for?
No thinking! No thinking! Tie or ascot?
But-but you know you cannot get involved with your assistant.
What's up? Tell Monica I'm sorry. Tell her yourself!
My chest hurts! Oh, and now I-I can't breathe.
Oh good! Because we have an "I'm sorry" song.
Okay, this is where you and I part ways. Noisy bitch!
Oh, it's the compulsively neat one by the window, okay.
No you're not, you're wondering which cushion it is.
That's good. I got to admit, I thought it was something else.
Ok Mike, better come back Mike, better come back.
Uh! The psychic also said that I would be betrayed.
Uck, look at this! Pottery Barn, yuck!
Thank you for coming everybody. There're cookies in the back.
Yeah... That does sound great. I'm going to get the phone.
Somebody went to college. Wow. What is it? I'm sorry.
Hey! Ooh, how was your first day working at the restaurant?
We were just wondering if Chandler's girlfriend is a girl.
Oh, there's no such thing as an innocent burger.
Oh...you don't have to go, I have something that will fit you.
I did it! I took care of the babies all by myself!
See? I'm doing it. I am totally doing it. I lost it.
Oh, I'm sorry, the oven mitts really freaked me out.
Umm, when I get married will you be my maid of honor?
Yeah, it's in the guys' apartment under the sink. Why?
Oh, totally. Oh, God, oh, she seemed so happy too.
I didn't know where to put it so I just left it here for now.
I'll be a fool for you. I'm sure, you know I don't mind.
Aww, and good luck to you too! What a nice lady!
No, but I like it. I think I left one of my rat babies.
Well... Yeah. You look great too. Did you get a haircut?
Oh all right, then I guess we're going back into the hallway.
Yeah, um, which ones in particular were great for you?
Well look no further, this one's yours! Ahhh.
I would, but I get my morning sickness in the evening.
Uh-huh, well! But umm, still I'm-I'm mad at you.
It really does... how long do you think we have to stay?
Okay! Rach, hi, I need those earrings you borrowed.
Get away from that! No! She's just getting dressed.
Wait, wait, I'm getting a deja vu...no, I'm not.
No, it's not supposed to be funny, it's supposed to be scary.
Oh, yeah, Bob said there might be flood damage.
Oh, you just caught me off guard! Yeah, that would be nice.
Well, I've never had it, I feel so left out. Oh look!
Hello grandma, if that is in fact your real name.
I don't know. They're so perfect for each other; it's crazy.
If you don't sail your boat, what do you do on it?
Well, that would be great but then what do we do about Denise?
Excuse me, but umm, isn't he paying for your dinner?
It's so inspired! Look at him! Look at him go!
Noooo!! Damn you ref! You burn in hell!!!
So, I just came from the company Ursula works for.
Well no, it was my fault so you should get the nice room.
But y'know what? It just seems that you two belong together.
Okay, you know where you are better than I do. I was just curious.
Oh! Okay, that actually makes more sense. So how was it?
Yeah I guess you're right. Yeah thanks. This helped. Thanks.
Honey, you've got to go. What's his office number?
I went shopping with Monica all day, and I had a salad.
No, it sucks. I was saving up to buy a hamster.
No-no-no oh, keep your name, don't take his name.
Don't worry about me, I'm a robot! I'm just a machine!!
Oh, okay. Well, so tell me everything about my parents. Everything.
Nope. You don't want to see a face covered with pox.
Why would the copy guy say he was Ralph Lauren?
Still going through that dry spell with Carol?
Well you certainly can't give her that stupid gumball ring.
Oh, Jason? Yeah, uh-huh, we're seeing each other tonight.
I think that uh, yours is a question with many answers.
I know! But if I didn't work there, what else would I do?
Come on, play that funky music white boy.
Bras! We bought bras! We bought bras.
Chicken. Which is so ironic considering I'm a vegetarian.
Okay, yeah well, good news, you're going to have three babies.
Let's see! Oh, you know who's great? Sandy Poophack.
No, not Phoebe, Dr. Philange. Oh no! You have it too!
Yeah but why didn't you just say that you didn't read the book?!
Joey, she's so cool. She speaks four languages.
Oh yay! Great! Okay, what room number is he in?
Wait a minute, I see what's happening here. You're threatened.
I'm just saying, this woman, I mean she's fictitious. No?
Okay, thank you very much, I'm gonna take a short break!
That's true. Well, is anything you told me about yourself true?
All right, I'm gonna go take a pregnancy test, right now.
You know, you are talking about one of my dear, dear friends.
Okay, now you're just taking lines right out of the song!
I know I am. That's why I can't wear a digital watch.
There-there was a suicide note?! Well, do you still have it?
Fine! I'll call Zurich and move some money around.
Ok, I've got milk Here you go... Oh! Better?
Well if we make it yesterday, woo-hoo! We're done!
Ok, do you know how to go from D to A minor?
Yeah a little. He seems really nice. Good kisser.
Y'know, you're friend's getting married, it's gotta change things.
Oh no, the Mendels, they hate all living things, right?
Okay, this is inexcusable. I am shocked to my very core!
Oh, no. Don't you hate it when people aren't there for you?
Rachel Green? Son of a bitch, she came back?
Yeah, well, don't "Aww Pheebs, that sucks!" me yet.
Um, the matador. Ole, ha ha ha.
Butterscotch? No one? All right, you'll be sorry later.
How could you say yes, what about our catering business?
Oh, it's so pretty. This must have cost him a fortune.
Oh, please! She's always got a broom in her hand!
Pumpkin? Yeah. But did he ever call you like, Budolph?
Umm, okay I would like to talk to you about your toner needs.
You keep the old ones in the back, that is so ageist.
Don't make me do this again, I don't like my voice like this.
Oh hey! So, how did your doctor's appointment go?
Oh, no, I meant that it's weird that you only have nine now.
Ohh!! God! Ooh! Get out of here, good for nothing.
Ooh, this is so exciting! Ooh, God, what are you going to bet?
Ooh, I have tasted my own medicine and it is bitter!
What about her whining and her constant need for attention?!
Have you two, you know... like... you know... you know... yet?
Tomato tart and which of the pastas would you recommend?
Yeah. Oh! It'll be like I have a wife in the fifties!
His first big kid's bike, this is so exciting!
I don't know. I'll just handle it-I'll ask you to talk to him!
Okay, so... allright... Which dress? You can say "neither".
Okay, so after this audition, who decides who gets it?
Oh. Mine does. Stephanie knows all the chords.
Oh good! Then you're in luck! Ben's not my son!
Ooh, my first birthday present... ..oh, this is really...
Yeah... All right, well that rules out Lana Titweiller.
Why would you leave your Belgian waffle in the hall?
I'm sorry, I'm just-I'm...I'm just not ready for a relationship right now.
Oh! Suddenly somebody knows all about the side affects!
So, how does Mona feel about you and Rachel living together?
I'm trying, but man that guy can push my buttons!
Ross, could we please, please, please listen to anything else?
Yeah, 'cause otherwise someone might get what they actually ordered.
Okay, so now they know that you know and they don't know that Rachel knows?
I can't!! I can't!! Noooooooo!!!!!!! You son of a bitch!!!!!
No, no, I'm fine, and y'know why? 'Cause of all the riboflavin.
Oh Ross, calm down, I'll give you the 80 cents.
Yeah... And that physique! You must work out all the time...
No-no, it's okay. But are we sure we don't want the waterbed?
No, but would you like a thousand dollars and a football phone?
No but at Monica's you can eat cookies over the sink!
Well, his name is Parker and I met him at the drycleaners.
So why don't ya show us the rest of your casa?
Will you excuse us, we need to talk for a moment.
Not that way! But the bike brought you a lot closer!
Well, if she isn't then cremating her was a big mistake.
Oh I got it!! Oh! Ew! Broken boob! Ow!
Ooh, yeah. Then what are you going to put on top of that?
It's so weird, I have never been fired from anything before!
Ah-ha! A classic sign of love, the hug!
I feel like my face is swelling. Is my face swelling?
He's just trying to show Joey how much he means to him.
I can't have any. You know I don't eat meat. Ohhh no.
C'mon, happy family gets a dog, frontier fun.
Remember how you said you were really dense about poetry? Oh.
Now wasn't Joey hitting on her at the wedding too?
Yeah! You know all those yummy noises? I wasn't faking.
Hey! So you guys have anything planned for the big last night?
Someday I'll, tell you about the time I stabbed the cop.
Okay, I just thought of the perfect guy for Rachel to take to her thing.
Oh, it's so romantic to send people off on their honeymoon.
Well, a palm reader, a manicurist, a hand doctor...
Come on Ross, you're a paleontologist, dig a little deeper.
No! You don't have to do anything! Just don't tell them that we know!
Okay. Hey Mon, why did you tell the guys you weren't pregnant?
I-I, came to fill your ice cube trays.
Oh no! Not that guy! He does look like him though.
What if I had taken that job at Merrill Lynch?
Oh my God Chandler, the one you picked is gone. It's over!
Ooh, I just pulled out four eyelashes. That can't be good.
Really? So she said, she didn't wanna live with me anymore?
You don't need Janice for that, you've got us. We...
Well umm, do you wanna get something to eat? I'm kinda hungry.
Ok, this is the most romantic disease I've ever had.
Yeah, this book was light years ahead of its time.
OK, hey, HEY. Is your boyfriend the boss of you?
...in you, my endless love. My endless love.
No you can't quit college! No! You're in college? Really?
Whoah, ooh, why is the air in here so negative?
Oh weird, Chandler just told us he's got a conference there!
All right, I can't sit here anymore. I have to walk places.
Well isn't he your friend? Don't you want him to be happy?
And all of the sudden his hands weren't the problem anymore.
Oh, I love you Hexadrin! Oh look! It comes with a story!
Yeah, Chandler why don't you take a walk? This doesn't concern you.
The mailman was downstairs, so I brought up your mail.
Yeah, and they've been coming by all day. They love it!
I sense these things. It was either but or butter.
What a great night, Chandler can't do it, these guys kissed...
Why couldn't you have just figured this out six years ago?
I know! I know, and I've only been playing for like an hour!
Cute naked guy is really starting to put on weight.
Come on Ross. We're sorry. Please tell us what it is.
No, you're too late!!! She already took out the trash!!!
Shhh! Stop it! Stop it Rachel! You can't do this here!
And a scented candle for the bathroom, because well, y'know.
Maybe the overlords needed them to steer their spacecrafts.
Oh, I can't believe you! You've been so good, for three years!
Oooh. Let's do. Let's send them mashed potatoes.
Oh, my new Mom, who-who's a big, fat abandoner!
Na-uh, no, we are all responsible for our own babies.
Oh yeah! I'd let him check out my kitchen floors.
Well normally I don't, but y'know......Green Bay is playing.
Yeah. But I also believed her when she said I was next.
Hey! Why isn't it Spiderman? Y'know like Goldman, Silverman...
This is going to be so much fun! Okay-shhh, I have to finish.
I would like to make a pledge. I would like to donate $200.
Well, he came in for a massage and everything was fine until...
Can I get you something to drink? Like a water and Valium?
Wow. So then did you make it with beef or Eggplant?
Yes! A friend of mine did it and it's totally legal!
Well, I snapped! Okay? You weren't taking the class seriously.
Can I please take these off? I swear I won't scratch.
Yes, 'cause now I have to go down there, and deal with them.
Oh wow, ooh! Ooh, big step for Phoebe and Mike.
Okay, you have to switch with me! Monica is driving me crazy!
All right, all right... I'll play if we don't keep score!
Whatever, it's the perfect end to the perfect weekend anyways.
My God, I can't get a minute of peace around this place.
Okay-okay, why don't I sit here and you'll both stop it!
I don't believe you! That is...brilliant! And Monica has no idea?
Thanks a lot! I just got that jerk out of my mind!
Oh, okay, it's the slide instead of stairs. Watch this.
Okay, it just seems pretty wild and you're so-y'know so...vanilla.
No, Joey! You borrowed my cab; you have to drive it back.
Happy, happy Chanukah, Chandler and Monica. Very merry...
All right, I'd better go too. I have to go talk to my dad.
It's not in the apartment? Oh no. I can't believe this is happening again.
Hello? What kind of bitch hangs up on a doctor!
No reason! That would just be a really big surprise, right?
Umm, no, not at first 'cause I-I don't want to freak him out
Ok, here are the birthday candles. Where's the birthday cake?
Okay, I will. But right after you tell me who the hell you are.
Yeah. Oh, that's gone too. This is Monica's bathroom right?!
Oh please, you are not gonna ditch again like you did with London.
How come you're watching a rabbi play electric guitar?
Okay, okay, okay, okay... Still sure about me being myself?
Well, the only thing you can do. Sleep with Ralph Lauren.
I told you not to do that yet. And, she wants to do a video.
Is it Ross? It's Ross isn't it-Oh my God, it's Joey!
I love you goddesses. I don't ever want to suck your wind again.
I'm so sorry! No I'm sorry! No I'm sorry! No I'm sorry!
Wow! That's exciting, you went to Japan, made up a woman.
Yeah, me too. Not in the shaky angry way you are though.
Yeah, and you have nothing to worry about 'cos they're all crap!
But, can't you leave the dollar? This money is for the poor.
Oh! Here we all are! Yeah, there's Ross and Joey and you and me.
No that's what you do when you want to get the truth out of someone.
I know it's so exciting! You know I've never lived with a guy before.
Sting's son, seven years old and there's a picture.
That man across the street just kicked that pigeon! Oh!
Don't be so corny Ross, it's not an after-school special.
Rachel? Patrick is really rich. Give her some money.
Ameri-can. Y'know it's a very hard language. Let's do it again.
Hey! It's raining. I don't want to fly in the rain. So...
Oh, anyway, they say, if we want, we can see it tonight.
David's like, y'know, Scientist Guy. He's very methodical.
Hmm, y'know there's another word for people like that. Losers!
All right, stop it. Now you're just doing it to freak me out.
You too. And Ursula?! It was really nice meeting you tonight!!
Monica, how did this happen? I thought you had this all planned out.
No it isn't, this is my dad, alright, I'll show you.
Wow! You're good! After this, we should solve crimes.
Ya-huh, all the time, cause they are the lightning bearers.
Just from a, from a long time ago. Is he here?
You name one woman that you broke up with for a real reason.
Aw! Hey, do you think that Susan person is her lover?
Well, he came in for a massage, and everything was fine until.
Well, we just decided that Rachel is gonna be your maid of honor.
I see. Nice sidestep on the do do thing by the way.
Oh no, ooh, ooh, did somebody forget to use a coaster?
Well, if you don't want your mother to move in with you, just tell her.
No! It's not a cigarette! The smoke is coming out of me!
Yeah, I see what you mean. By the way, nice Ross imitation.
Um, oh, I've got a birthday party, with some work people.
No! No, we have an emergency. Okay? Rachel's coming to London.
HEY! Mike called were going out again! YAY! YAY!
Mon, maybe one of these guys wants to wear your dress.
Oh my god, Rachel asked me if I knew anyone for her too.
Yes, I did it!!! I nailed it!!! Yay! What's next?
Oh no! That really is nothing, she is very sexually aggressive.
Oh my god! Look, it's Ross and Rachel. Oh, the plan is working.
Oh my God! You dated someone with a glass eye too?!
Oh my God! I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Which one's Demi Moore?
Oh, I'm going to give him something else besides joy, just...
I wouldn't bring that up, it would probably just bum him out.
Yeah, ooh, I like that! Yeah. Wait! How do you know about 'bah-bah-bha-bhan?'
Wow, ooh, you're gonna be making money hand over fist!
Yeah that's great! Next to that, Chandler won't look so stupid.
Oh my God! That guy at the counter is totally checking you out!
Yeah, if you get married in Vegas, you're only married in Vegas.
Oh. Well is she, is she the first that you've been with?
Come on! Let us be guys! Maybe we want to be guys!
Guess what. Frank Jr., and Alice got married!
No! Not the sex part, just the stuff leading up to it.
I lost a whole year! I can't believe it! This is so unfair!
Be careful, be careful! These are my rat babies!
Oh, I don't know, I don't know. I think that's a little weird, y'know? Vinyl.
No, y'know what don't close it 'cause the... keys...are in there.
So great! Okay! Tomorrow we're gonna drive out to Montauk.
Hey, does anybody want to join me in the aroma room?
All right. I'll do it, I kissed him before I can do it again.
Oh, yeah, that's the word I use when I can't remember the real thing.
I know, I just want to bite his bottom lip. But I won't.
Oh no wait, oh no, the elastic on my underwear busted.
Well that's only two days away. What is the other option?
Well, okay, I made a touchdown. It was my first touchdown. So?
Oh yeah, the doctor said that could be one of the side effects.
God! Ooh! What is that smell? It's coming from the bathroom. Ooh!
Well, I just got off the phone with my lover, James Brolin...
How about you less important people, let's open your presents!
No, we were talking about tennis. Tennis is more believable.
No I'm serious. I mean I'm intuitive, but my memory sucks.
Eh, better her than me! Hey, let's bake cookies!
Oh, I told the stripper to be here at five. That's good right?
Oh, thanks a lot. Do you want to get a cup of coffee?
Stating the obvious, but thank you. And it's not weird is it.
We're just celebrating that Joey got his health insurance back.
Yeah, but y'know, about have of these are gonna end up getting divorced.
We have got to get you lazy boys out of these chairs.
Yay!! Oh so, you're not, you're not mad at us anymore?
Ooh that is definitely Chandler, Joey, or Ross. Or-or Rachel!
Look, he gave me his night vision goggles and everything.
Not unless someone borrowed it and left it at the gynecologist.
OK, I wasn't in love with him and I was just helping out a friend.
Hey, y'know what? My Grandma had the exact same bag!
Okay, time to bring up the rest of the cups. Oh, hi Joey!
Not yet. Umm, I heard they really hurt, do they hurt?
On how far along he's in the sex change process!
You guys wanna try and catch a late movie or something?
I don't care, I've never won anything before, I can't believe this!
Yeah? And, he's-he's so centered and mature and confident.
Uhuh. Because I'm a single mother, supporting my two children.
Phoebe. Phoebe. Phoebe, yeah. She named me after you I guess.
Yeah, well, ya know, I'm kind of spooky that way. Wooo.
I know it's le poo right now, but it'll get better.
Monica! We lived together for years! I've seen you naked!
Joseph! Thou needn't worry, they shan't be long.
What's the big deal, y'know? It's not like it's a real marriage.
I just can't decide who she looks more alike, you or Rachel?
You just can't stand anyone else enjoying themselves can't you?
Oh okay, well I'm a masseuse, and I used to work at this place...
Good. I'm really looking forward to you and me having sexual intercourse.
Umm, well I sorta have some bad news, can I come in?
Speech! Speech! Let's hear from the birthday girl! Huh?
Oh. Y'know, he hums while he does other stuff to.
Oh, can I play too? I've never played football, like ever.
I can't believe I still don't know what happened to the window in the attic!
Oh yeah! Yeah, no, we're gonna connect, y'know bond, and everything.
If I let go of my hair, my head will fall off.
Listen to this! My reading was wrong, I'm not going die!
It's interesting that you lost. Now, I forget, do you like to lose?
Oh no, don't hate, you don't want to put that out into the universe.
Or instead, maybe you could just not marry my brother Frank.
Um, gram, um, can I see the pictures of my dad again?
Oh-oh no she doesn't! I know what that is. You can stay.
Umm, well I had a similar problem when I lived in Prague.
Is that a new Swede jacket? It looks really expensive.
No..umm, could I talk to one of them? It's very very important.
Oh yeah well, I'm sorry about that too, but what are you going to do?
Oh good! All right, so you decided to tell him about the Richard thing.
Yay! It's so exciting! Wow, you could've done that with us there.
You're thing. You're thing. Y'know? You're the guy who gets divorced.
Oh, Joey! Oh, okay, see I didn't recognize you wearing, in those....pants.
Yes... I'm sorry, I've never met a boyfriends parents before...
Oh, wait, let me get you another glass. That's been sitting out.
I know. But don't you think that it should be called Order and Law?
What about my children Drake?! Huh!? No!! No!! No! God!
Hey you guys, you will never guess who's coming to New York.
We didn't fool around with any of them. Dwha! Dwha!
No, 'cause this line is passion, and this is... just a line.
I don't know! How are the-the-the-the, y'know-You're clothes aren't funny.
So listen, you know my friend Chris who owns the crematorium?
You guys are over an hour late. What happened to you two?
Is it me, or is veto starting to sound really good?
Umm, I'm sorry. Won't-won't Jack's father be joining us?
Okay, just tell me this, did you or did you not smell her hair?
Ooh! I thought of a good flaw! Ross pops his gum!
Oh, you are so much the smitten kitten. You should ask him out.
Oh I do, it's.... it's Bob Saget. She hates him.
Oh, God, just do it! Call her! Stop being so testosteroney!
Why do you think, she's having so much fun living with Joey?
I can't help it. I need the meat. The baby needs the meat.
Okay, yeah, I'll see you later! Don't forget about the moving in!
That's like the tenth time I've peed since I've been here!
Wrap it up, wrap it up, wrap it up...
I need to talk to you, it's pretty urgent. It's about Monica and Chandler.
Oh, you're such a gentleman. Come on! We're going to my place!
Wait, what was that? That sounded like someone being nice to you.
I didn't do it! It was Chandler! He's... He's mad at you!
You guys! You guys! You're gonna have a baby! They're gonna have a baby!
I know but it's so hard! Nothing rhymes with your stupid name!
Duh, I think I know how to heat breast milk. Ok.
Ooh yeah! Then umm, what goes on top of the salami?
Shh, wait and see. Maybe we will, maybe we won't.
I will tell you as soon as you thank me for writing my book.
White Plains. Oh, it sounds like such a magical place.
What a mean thing to say! I would never tell you it's not your birthday!
I just-I thought you guys were doing it, I didn't know you were in love!
Oh my God Eric hi! Wait, how'd you get this number?
So, I decided I'm definitely going to go with either Joey or Chandler.
Be cool! Okay lady, your lurking days are over!
Y'know what, but there is, there is no right or wrong, here.
Oh, you so would! Oh, you should get that anyway. Like for clubbing.
Hey is this true, that you write a lot of your own lines?
Okay, alright, you buy me a soda, and then we're even. Okay?
Wow! I'm-I'm so happy for you guys. This is so-so, not stupid.
No!! Hey-hey that's not a Nutter-Butter, that's just an old Wonton!
Uh, it's a piece of paper and it says, "Ross" on it.
Well okay but I have two tickets to the ballroom dance finals.
Yeah, you know what the best part of it is? I get to do my "plan-laugh."
How - how do I get them to name the next one after me?
Okay, I hear you! Are you capable of talking about any thing else?
That is so smart! Break it off. Break it off now.
Yeah, I already have my bell and later on...I get my bucket.
Y'know Rach, I think that, I think you should be Monica's made of honor.
No thanks, I have a good one too. I just, I, I can't see him.
I can't say that didn't hurt. But I'll take you back Joey Tribbiani.
Well then you'd better hurry! The Angelica! Go! Go!
Oh wow. What, do you think maybe he's gonna tell you that he's gay?
Oh my God! That's the creep that you're with at the Statue of Liberty.
Well, of course I would want to see you. I...I think about you all the time.
No-no! That's okay, we'll just start over. Okay? Hi! I'm Phoebe.
Monica, you might want to remember that you are married. Where is Chandler anyway?
No, you threw out Phoebe. I'm Ms. Regina Phalange. Phalange!
Okay, I got a good one. Okay, umm, what is she? Like 12?
I have to tell you this story. Okay, I was coming over here and this driver...
- and there's five hundred extra dollars in my account.
No! Look-look! There's the coffee table they stole from us!
I was going too. Umm, I brought some wine. Would you like some?
Chandler, you called Janice! That's how much you wanted to be with someone!
That's a really nice gift. I was thinking of like a gravy boat.
I have to tie my shoe, so you go ahead, I'll catch up.
You're not? Then why did you ask us if we wanted to go?
Okay. Listen, I'm sorry about before. Do you have anything her for $10.
No, we were just laughing. You know, how laughter can be infectious.
Hey, Joey, when you said the deal with Santa Clause, you meant?
But are you saying that you would move out if I didn't buy that lamp?
It's such a shame you can't see which finger I'm holding up.
Okay, this kind of back talk is not gonna fly when we're married!
Hey, I never got to hear who you guys would pick to be your girlfriend.
Monica, can I talk to you behind my menu, please. What are you doing?
Okay, don't worry, I'm just checking to see if the muscle's in spasm...huh.
Besides, it might be kinda fun to form the new A-Team.
Well, umm, my Mom's friend, Phoebe, is actually my birth Mom.
Well for the regular guy, it's bad, but Chandler, Oh dear God!
One really does have a stick up one's ass. Doesn't one?
No, no, no. I'm sorry. It's "smelly cat, smel-ly cat".
If she's no fun, why do you want to date her at all?
Anyway, I just wanted to say thank you, it was just, it was so sweet.
Alright, I'm, I'm gonna go. I'm sorry about the dog, everything. I'm sorry.
All right, that makes sense. Ugh. But-Screw you I'm going first!
If you never smoke again I'll give you seven thousand dollars!
Oh my God! You're getting a massage! You never let me massage you!!
Oh, come on Will! Just take off your shirt and tell us!
Oh no!You guys aren't supposed to get divorced for 7 years!
Oh well, all right...um, no offense, but you were kind of rude.
Well look, if I wanted to see a fireman, I would date one. Okay?
Oh, interesting you should call me that! Now that I may never have one!
Well, I finally took your advice and asked him what was going on.
Wow! See, and I didn't think you'd be able to come up with anything.
Hey listen let me ask you, do you believe in soul mates?
Well, maybe it won't work out. Maybe Ross won't like her personality.
Well, you could wait 'til I go to the dentist, maybe I'll kill him.
Oh, Ross you're right, I don't know why I always thought this was real grass.
Oh before I forget, are you coming to Mike's piano bar tonight?
Yeah I mean if you want to say anything to her, I'd tell her off.
Ok, ok, how many of you enjoyed the music outside? Ha!
Yeah, so, he had a really funny hat-I don't want to talk about it.
Really? That's so sweet. I mean, I'm officially offended but, sweet.
Hey oh, Rach wait! Do you want to go to a movie tonight?
What a neat idea. All your clothes match. I'm gonna do this.
Okay, and then this is the coffee house. This is where I play my music.
It's gotta be better than that book. Oo! Like a crossbow!
Oh! I knew it! I knew it! I felt really thick this morning.
Oh no, none of them are the father. The father is my brother.
Smelly cat, smell-ly cat, what are they feeding you? Everybody.
Okay. All right. Good luck explaining all the calls to China.
I know, I want that too, but IS that going to make it too hard?
Well, who cares what your Mom thinks? So you pulled a Monica.
Wait, I'm-I'm sorry. What's the big deal about a holiday card?
Yeah, it all just came screaming back to me. So how's the game?
Me neither. I think I need to be with someone who wants what I want.
He-he does not like it! He hates it! He's in pain!
Build the unit Cinderelly, lay the tile Cinderelly.
Uh oh, ooh, are we not getting along with the new boy?
Wait! Wait! Hi! Listen, Ross can I just talk to you for just a second?
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm so rude. Does anyone want to come to the movies?
God. Do think it really doesn't hurt? 'Cause how can they do that?
Why? Just 'cause you're too lazy to get up off your touchie?
What a sad little life she must lead. Okay, ooh .
Happy Christmas Eve Eve. Oh my God, where did you get this?
Fire alarm? Oh! Hi, officer-fireman, can-can I help you?
Oh that's my grandma. And thanks Joey she's having a really great time.
OK so isn't there a little part of you that wants to get up there?
Not especially. But you know what, I think they had pot in them.
I know I'm not, but you are, and I was trying to spare your feelings.
No, no actually, he's smiling.. and... Oh my God, don't do that!!
I just, I just have this really strong feeling that this cat is my Mother.
Yay-oh-yay! Okay, I gotta go tell Frank and Alice! Right now!
Yes, it was! It was him! Uh huh! Okay, it was me!
Wow, that's great! I liked that better than the law thing, so...
OK, here I go. . . here I go. . . I'm goin'.
Oh, well, don't tell me you want to keep more of your stuff in my uterus.
Fine. But you can't help me develop my new universal language.
Oh my God. You'd put that poor little creature in jail?
Ohh, umm, we kinda took a little detour on the way over here.
Ohh. Oh wait! you guys won't be late for my dinner, will you?
That's ridiculous Rachel, we were all babies once. Oh, you mean today.
Uh-huh! Why do you think it takes me so long to answer the door?
Great, all right, okay, and Monica ask me to make the drumming stop.
Oh did you-what did you-did you work for two days straight?
Joey, can I have a sip of your coffee and a bite of your muffin?
Hey. I'm so excited; I just set up Rachel with the worst guy tonight.
So umm, I'm gonna get us some drinks. Would you help me out?
OK, fine, if it means that much to you I'll get rid of Bob.
My mom never gave birth. Oh! But my birth mom did.
He doesn't have rabies, he has babies. That's what my mom said.
Because the more I drink, the less there is for the kids to drink.
Oh, it's your audition from this morning. Can I use the phone again?
Ooh, hey, could we put on the news? I think it might be raining.
That is unfair. I'll call her and tell her it was totally my fault.
Kyle's ex-wife? You were supposed to divert her not date her!
Why?! You two are so meant to be together, everybody thinks so.
Hey Rach, what time do you get off? We're all gonna do something tonight.
They live on the upper east side on Park Avenue!
Yeah. Hard Ass and Wuss. We could fight crime!
You mean you stole it! Don't cover your mouth when you do that!
Oh no, one of those 'look for the hidden meaning' songs.
Oh OK. So, um, the cat stinks but you love it, let's go.
Umm, I lost one of your earrings. I'm sorry! I am so, so sorry!
I'm in vice. Yeah, in fact I'm undercover right now. I'm a whore.
Yeah, 'cause hello, these are not her boobies, these are her breasts.
OK fine! Please come and support Mike. You don't have to sing.
Mr. Bing's office. No I'm sorry, he's in a meeting right now.
I... I cannot believe Ross even made this list. What a dinkus.
No it's not great. No, she's coming to tell Ross that she loves him.
Ohh, that's so nice! How great! Well, where? Where's the trip?!
You just did it again. Chandler, your feelings for Chandler are certainly gone!
She said, "He's obviously still in love with this Rachel girl."
Ok. We can, um, we can burn the stuff they gave us.
Umm, I...I just think you don't expect someone so hot to be so sweet.
Hey you guys, Hums While He Pees just asked me out!
So, what did Rachel say when you told her you were still married to her?
Okay, maybe it was a trick question. Um, Rachel can we do this now?
That sounds really great, but maybe you should be in charge of wiping.
Um, the off-Broadway play people said 'You were pretty but dumb.'
Oh my God!!! Monica!! He's the stripper from your bachelorette party!!
Okay, enough with the third degree! I-I've, I don't live here anymore.
Sure! I feel so bad for you; I broke my leg once too.
Hey Ross! Doesn't Ben go to the Smithfield Day School?
It will be...in a minute. Listen, Tim you're a really great guy.
Well, it's just y'know that something like this would never to like The Hulk, y'know...
Oh! Oh my god. This is so exciting. How much am I gonna get?
Well, I think I broke it. But that's all right, here's the number you can call.
Well, if that's what they do in Minsk... In New York... it's...
Oh no! No-no! I understand the pain! Don't-don't hurt the puppy.
What the smell from Joey's? No, I can hardly smell it over here.
Oooh, is daddy getting angry? Is daddy gonna spank me?
Ooh, ok, that's it. Enough with the keys. No one say keys.
Well, I've got to get out of this bed, I'm going crazy here. Crazy!
Oh ok, Ryan, that guy I went out with, who's in the Navy.
But on the southern route there's a chicken that plays tic-tac-toe.
I think so too. And that little flap? Great for holding my lipstick.
Why would you start again after chewing all that quitting gum?
Yes there are! There are totally good deeds that are selfless.
No, I mean you break up with Janice and I'll break up with Tony.
Yeah, no, I'm fairly intuitive and psychic. It's a substantial gift.
David! What-what are you doing here? Aren't you supposed to be in Russia?
Um, yeah, you want Ursula, and I'm Phoebe. Twin sisters! Seriously.
Fine. All right, I'll give you one pointer. Look out for that bitch.
Oh, well get in line missy. So, can I have a ride stud?
Well, what I really want is for my mom to be alive and enjoy it with me.
Gooood luck! Gooood luck! We all wish you good luuuuuuuuck!!!
Right. Or you might get everything you've wanted since you were fifteen.
So, Scott asked me to come over for lunch today and I did.
Okay, okay, but Rachel's gonna be here too, can't I just ask her this stuff?
I gotta call him. Just to talk to him, there's no harm in that.
Oh. Ew! Ew! Ew! Ugh! Y'know what? This is too weird.
I just-I don't want us to jump into something we're not ready for.
Hello, Hello. Ohh, OHH, she knew I could kick her ass.
Okay-Oop! Too late! I'm leaving! Come on Chandler let's go!
Sounds like somebody wants to be Mr. Pizza Delivery Girl.
No, I know what a silent is I meant, what's going on with your hair?
Are you kidding? People acting like animals to music. Come on!
Oh, I don't make them a lot because I don't think it's fair to the other cookies
What?! No, you can't, you can't leave me here with them! We're baby-sitting!
Yeah, but, y'know, it's... it would be like starting on the fifteenth date.
What the hell is this, herbal tea? I hate herbal tea!
Why don't you go up there and ask him to 'step lightly, please?'
Oh well, I guess Italian isn't one of the four languages you speak.
Well, what am I going to tell Monica? She wants to wear them tonight!
Oh, I'm sorry. But I really like this guy. And I think he really happens to like me.
Hey Mon umm, if you do get married, can I bring two guests?
You guys are so pathetic, I, oh, OH, XANADU! OH.
Yeah, but did they have to shoot him down? I mean, that was just mean.
All right, we'll se you and Mike at the restaurant in a couple hours.
Who's cell phone is that? It's just so annoying; everywhere you go.
Yeah, we should get a move on if we wanna make those dinner reservations.
Oh yeah-No, she was really nice to me, but she's in hell for sure.
Okay, we have like ten minutes. Do you want me to get into that now?!
Ohh, you guys, remember that cute client I told you about? I bit him.
Yeah, I know. Oh, good thing it's one of those 801 numbers. Right?
So, now, Rach, this is a traditional English trifle, isn't it?
That's all right, I'll work here. This is goo, next to this plant.
Ooh! That's a good one! Mine is to pilot a commercial jet.
It's too soon to tell. She's resting, which is a good sign.
Oh, no umm, hi, that-that, you have to put that out, 'cause I'm pregnant.
Well, how about a compromise then, okay? What if it's like y'know, Chanoey?
Oh my God!! No! What?! Help me! Let me out! Now!
well it was awful every time I thought about what you said I started crying.
No. Oh wait yes! I do, I do have one question. What is toner?
Oh, I almost don't want to show this. Just remember I'm a minute younger.
Of course! Yeah, I was uh, umm Thigh Mega Tampon.
I got it from your maid. She's a bitch, but I wore her down.
Y'know what? We thought you were different. But I guess it was just the coma.
Wow, you guys go way back then. So what are you up to these days?
Well I don't, I don't have a mother so often I forget that other people...
I think he's right. You guys hang out at the coffeehouse way too much.
Fine! Then you tell Roger because he was really looking forward to this!
Oh, well what are you doing here? Are you about to do it? Is it Gunther?
Okay. All right, this is my favourite part of the weekend, right now, this.
No! No!! It's me! It's me! I-I didn't want to make any noise!
Yes!! Yes!! I'm the next caller! You were gonna have me hang up.
No I'm having fun. I'm really-And I'm really-really excited for you and Ursula.
Yeah, and these are my friends. People. This is Vince, Vince the people.
What? He's gonna be dressed as a baby! Oh hi Mrs. Green!
No, only the three of you, any more than that and she'll get suspicious.
Oh hey, Monica, I heard you saw Donald Trump at your convention.
She untied his G-string with her teeth. Somebody stop me!
Are you sure? I'll bet there's another flight to Minsk in like...
It's just my knitting that's all! Yes! I knit this. I'm very good.
Okay. Okay! Well okay, who do we know that's coming? Me. Are you?
Um well I don't really. Just genetically. He's kinda my dad too.
I brought a bunch of stuff for the house, so check it out. Ha-ha.
Ohh! Oh my. Oh, that reminds me, I have to see my OB-GYN today.
Rosss can! Give me the tickets! Ross can give me the tickets!!
Because my psychic is dead! She must've read the cards wrong!
Monica, she will kill you. She will kill you like a dog in the street.
'Cause, you know, if you don't look good, we don't look good. I love that voice.
No reason, it's just I know a single guy that cares about other people.
That is so weird! I had a dream that you'd have lunch with Richard.
Ok, Love Story, Brian's Song, and Terms of Endearment.
Absolutely! Just fight all your natural instincts and you'll be great.
OOOOOHHHHH! Fine, I can't take it anymore! I'm putting an end to this!
Oh, I was telling them about you and Emily. Y'know, try to get some sympathy.
Wow, I have the spirit of an old Indian women living in mine.
Well, I can't give you a massage, because my licence has been revoked again!
Or, we could not tell them we know and have a little fun of our own
Okay! Hey! What do I do?!! What are you doing? Did you find the dress?
No, no, Mr. Heckles no one is making any noise up here.
Uh, hello, this is Ross Geller's personal physician, Dr. Philange.
I can't! My circuits are fried! They're fried I tell you!!
That's sweat. You throw up all morning, you'll have that glow too.
Uh, wow! Isn't it ironic that he liked you and now you like him?
Like crop circles, or the Bermuda triangle, or evolution?
Also uhm... I just want you to know what a wonderful man your son is.
Me too! Oh! Did you ever see An Officer and a Gentleman?
That's short for Phoebe?! I thought that was just what we called each other!
Okay. Oh but don't tell them Monica's pregnant because, they frown on that.
OK Rach, which, which lily? This lily or that lily?
Oh, oh sweet Lord! This is what evil must taste like!
I'm starving. I know we were coming here tonight, I ate nothing all day.
Yeah, but only a genius would swallow a sonic blaster gun.
Why are you guys so upset? It's Old Yeller, it's a happy movie.
Are you kidding?! Another week with that sip, I'll kill myself!
Wait, if that's his favourite area, why is he being so mean to it?
No, we're gonna paint over the sword, and replace it with a baguette.
And I'm still waiting for my paper mache man. Thank you my babies.
Now, wait a minute. So, they're gonna name their first child Joey?
Oh no, Rach, no no, you know you're never supposed to wake a sleeping baby.
What about Ross? What about your moment? Don't you want to talk to Ross about it?
Umm, this stuffing is amazing. Do you think we should bring them some?
Hey! Umm, well, only okay because I just got back from, from the hospital.
Wait a second! This is about the fourth month of your pregnancy, right?
I can see that. A plate of brownies once told me a limerick.
Hey, don't call him that! His name is Spackel Back Harry!
Y'know I'm-I'm sensing that um, my grandmother would not be comfortable with that.
That's like the third time that lady's won on a machine I was playing.
Hey everybody, Rachel was so good today. She didn't gossip at all.
It's so weird seeing Ross and Rachel with a baby. It's just so grown up.
Oh, they're just gonna umm, look to see if my endometria layer is thick.
Oh my God! So was she! Oh, I've got-I've got goose bumps.
Oh that's all right. I'm still full from your homemade potato chips.
It was the end of the party, you were probably ironing wrapping paper.
Ok, right there. That, that's the third sign today. Right there.
So weird, you think he's so gross and you're willing to eat his crackers.
Um, I'm getting a lily for my Mom. 'Cause her name's Lily.
Alright, here's my $7.50. But I think you should know that this money is cursed.
Or, we could not tell them we know and have a little fun of our own.
There it is! Oh, look at that! Isn't Mother Nature amazing?
Great! Okay, if you'll just excuse me. So, did you hear something you liked?
Yeah! So--ooh, I gotta ask you though. How did you know where to find me?
No!! wait, wait, wait!! Oh please, hold it up so I can listen.
Ok, great! All right, bye! Pain in the ass!! That's off, right?
Oh right, yeah okay, my Mom could, and I can't. We don't have that....
Which-which sister is this? Is this the spoiled one or that's bitter?
Chandler, your being here is the best Christmas present I could have ever imagined.
Well, maybe he wouldn't be she didn't bring the office home every night!
So-so you two were married huh? What happened? You just drift apart?
Give her a break, it's hard being on your own for the first time.
Unless! She wants to spend the night holding my hair back for me.
Thousands of times!! That doesn't make me sound too good does it?
Fine! But please God; tell me how to stop them from going off!
Okay, ask her 'What is her current method of birth control?'
I know her! I bought homemade soap from her at a Dead show!
I don't know, he just started kissing me. Get him! Get him, Vince!
Yeah. But y'know we were thinking about you, y'know we ordered the Joey Special.
Oh down please. I-I hate to be a ball buster can I just do it?
Shocking! Let's play the game of who can stay quiet the longest.
Absolutely! Y'know, you get this rush of feelings, but then it goes away.
Mike, let me ask you something. How many sisters does Joey have?
Listen. Listen. Smelly cat, smelly cat, what are they feeding you?
Ah, it's been so long, so long. I can't believe you're still doing this!
Okay, so we got some more good rejections, lots of stuff to work on.
I'm-I'm just saying, don't freak out until you're a hundred percent sure.
I know. They should be a family. They should get married and have more children.
Uh, uh, gimme. Can you see me operating a drill press?
You're so much more than just brains! You're sweet, and kind, and funny...
It's hard to believe that just a little while ago this was nothing but ingredients.
No way! No way! You just broke with Tag a week ago.
Okay, what is this? A stupid contest? Because we got a winner here!
Sure you can! Give them some blocks, put them in a playpen!
Ooh, that is silly. I'll go up there, I'll tell him to keep it down.
OK, I smell smoke. Maybe that's 'cause someone's pants are on fire.
That's easy for you to say, I don't see three kids coming out your vagina!
It was really fun, I mean I've never talked on a car phone before.
Would you relax? I know what I am doing. This is how he wears it.
Oh that's good, I guess she'll have a choice between my guy and your weirdo.
Well, since the fire was kinda my fault I guess you should get to stay here.
You guys, we've been waiting for you for a long time, maybe you should order.
All right. Although I don't think we need one, I never stopped loving you.
About twenty, a couple people from work who had something else to do.
You mean the-Okay by siadic, you mean the towel covered portion.
Is it okay if I leave this stuff here 'til Rachel's birthday party?
Hey, oh, you know that guy who's been following me? I talked to him today.
I just thought we might be here for awhile. You know, things might get musical.
I mean, I know Joey is not my boyfriend, or my thermos, or anything, but...
OK, that makes no sense. Why would the villagers worship a pharmacist?
Or...or we can chant and dance around naked, you know, with sticks.
Ooh, Atlantic City! Oh, that's a great plan! Who's plan was that?
C'mon Mike, you can beat her! Knock that dog off her head!
Aw. I'm just-I'm in a place in my life right now where I...I...
Yeah! Sure! Ooh, I left my purse up at Monica's. I'll be right back.
And no, oh please, oh please let me finish. Oh I guess that was it.
So Theodore... I uhm... I can see where Mike gets his good looks from...
Oh, okay, yeah. I put your stuff in her room, and her stuff in your room.
Yeah, but remember you said you ordered something special, and it just hasn't come yet?
No-no wait-wait! I can't just let you hang up! Just please talk to me.
Uh-huh. Oh, yeah, I could write about the time my hair did that "Woo-hoo" thing.
Um, then yes, it's 'cause of Phoebe! So, you know, it's either her or me.
Well, he may not be my soul mate, but a girl's gotta eat.
Oh I do! Oh, y'know what? No. Wait a second. I know it's in here somewhere.
You're welcome. And thank you for "Science Boy". I learned a lot from him.
Okay, okay, okay, the black. But, oh, do you have black, with the little strappys?
Well, maybe it's so big because the house was built on radioactive waste.
Yeah, much better. And you know what, don't feel bad, because it's a hard song.
I was preparing you for my-didn't you think I was dead? Did that not come off?
I'm gonna find a selfless good dead. I'm gonna beat you, you evil genius.
You ask us to find you a guy and you come traipsing in here with your own!
We found your test in the trash, if you're not pregnant--It's because I am.
Why Scott doesn't want to sleep with me. It's 'cause I'm not sexy enough.
Because, I'm just, I'm incredibly anal and an unbelievable control freak.
Have fun. Oh wait, no, don't! I forgot I am totally against that now.
Eww, look. Ugly Naked Guy lit a bunch of candles.
Does a dog's lips move when he reads? Okay, no they don't.
Then why are you answering? Do you at least know what route we're on?
Don't feel too sorry for me. At least my boyfriend isn't gay.
Oh yeah, no-no-no. I'm fine. I'm okay, but umm, my Grandma sorta died.
Oh hey Ross oh I'm so glad someone's here could you zip me up?
It's not a stupid gumball machine looking ring! It's a beautiful ring!
I know! You see it is stuff like this which is why you're burning in hell!!
All right. If you care enough to make up that load of crap, okay.
Where'd you get too? We lost you after you opened up all the presents.
Um-hmm, yeah. They left me a message; they should be here any minute.
Oh yes. Yes. Yeah-no. She did. She left you umm, this lipstick.
Well, lots of people! Look, are you coming to memorial service or not?
Okay, all right, so, your in a meadow, millions of stars in the sky....
As a masseuse and a human, I'm begging you, never do that to anyone!
And maybe I could teach Ben about the Christmas skull and how people die.
Yeah- no- I'm just- it's, I haven't worked- It's my bank.
You can't fire him and dump him the same day, he'll kill himself.
Wow! Big day huh? People moving in, people getting annulled...
Just for some short-term-work. You know, until I get back some of my massage clients.
Well speaking of chiming in, remember the time you burned down my apartment?
You've have lipstick right here . That's okay, it's mine, we just kissed.
Okay, fine. Come dinosaur, we're not welcome in the house of no imagination.
I had nothing to do with it. Okay, it was my idea, but I don't feel good about it.
What, he's not still following her. Do you think he is still following her?
OK. OK, alrighty, let's play some tunes. Hi everybody, I'm Phoebe
Umm, Rachel and I were just discussing it and she had some very interesting insights.
Yeah, but did you see the dents in his knuckles? That means he's artistic.
I really thought you making a good point. I mean y'know, until you got cut off.
Okay, okay. It's James Brolin. James Brolin is the father of my baby.
Oh yeah it is! I'm going to the movies and it starts in like five minutes.
No, I can't talk to you! I don't have a fancy ad in the Yellow Pages!
Listen. You are not going to believe this but, that is not me singing on the video.
Rachel, listen-I mean, if you let me have him then I will really owe you one.
Okay, now's not the time Joey. All right? You can yell at me tomorrow.
You don't have to lie anymore, Ross, I know that it was a fourteen year-old girl.
I think she means 'You dance a dance class'. Oh, c'mon, c'mon.
No, which one? The right or left? 'Cause the left one is lucky...
Ohh! Oh, the Chelsea Reporter, ohh, this used to keep me so warm.
Okay, she would love that! Y'know, 'cause you know all the clean places to eat.
Hi, yeah, hi! I'm umm, Phoebe Buffay, and I have babies coming out of me.
Hey, it's your Thanksgiving too, y'know, instead of watching football, you could help.
I know. I know. I know. I know, and if you try to make it more you might wreck it.
Hey, why don't you guys go, get portraits done by a professional photographer.
Um, I'm gonna have a cup of the cucumber soup, and, um, take care.
Uh huh! If it's a girl, Phoebe, and if it's a boy, Phoebo!
Yeah. Its just, you know, its this whole stupid Ursula thing, its...
No! No! It's just that he gave me three tickets and there are six of us!
If you wanted to punish them, you should've just made them hang out here!
Well, it's a problem for me, which means it's a problem for you 'cause I'm a cop.
Well, you're not more excited than I am! No way! I'm the most excited!
Oh, okay I didn't get that message. So this doesn't count-Anyway, I'll be in my office.
Oooh look! Isn't this adorable, Ross let Ben address mine!
Ooh, God, it's him! It's that cop! God, I can't believe it! He found me!
No! But it's the nicest kitchen, the refrigerator told me to have a great day.
What are the chances? 1 billion Chinese people and they send Mike!?
Ohh, you are so lucky! Hey! So, where's Monica? Did you guys make up?
"No time for losers, 'cause we are the champions of the world...!" Thank you!
All right. Oh! Shoot! Oh shoot! Uh, Rachel wanted to see this tape!
Another amazing find! Wow! Oh I bet this has a great story too!
Oh, there's a cab! Taxi!! Good timing, my God, huh? Here you go.
Hey, Ross! I know you're still mad at me, but can I just talk to you for a second?
Oh, check it out, oh check it out. It's Smelly Cat the video.
Oh, it's a key. To be honest, I think I'd prefer the five dollars.
Rach, Rach, I just remembered. I had a dream about Mr. Geller last night.
Oh!! That's my new thing. I figure bodies at peace, make peace.
Yeah. We don't speak. She's like this high-powered, driven career type.
Yeah, I would've except I had a big spaghetti stain on the other side.
Wow, Mike Hannigan...You sure know how to make a girl say "Hell yeah!"
You don't know him. It's not important. He wants nothing to do with me or the baby.
I'm sorry, Ross, this is my old friend Lowell from the streets. Lowell, Ross.
You know what? You are right. I am gonna quit. It's time I took my life back!
I don't want to go into the whole thing, but umm, we have words and I kill him.
Yeah! It's not like it spits out a Clark bar after every game.
Oh okay, well I'm sorry to bother you. Bye-bye. Yeah you're right, this is easy.
Yeah. Ooh God, there's that face again! See I can't do this job! I...
Yeah we thought it would be nice to use the fancy china for dessert too.
I don't know, it would totally depend on her coloring and... You got the job!!
Okay. And, my, dead, mother, says, you, are, it. I'm with Rachel.
Oh sure okay, you can touch yourself in front of us but you can't talk to Rachel.
Alright. I looked all over the building and I couldn't find the kitty anywhere.
All right. We're gonna take Clunkers to Ross's. We'll be back in a minute.
Oh, no no, that side doesn't have one, the paramedics had to cut through it.
No, I'm just deciding which one to use-I'm gonna start writing another book!
Oh you're my biggest fan? I've always wanted to meet you! Hi! Sure! Yeah!
Mhuh, guys, that means the world to me. Huh, nkay, I'm gonna take off.
No-no, it'll be fun! We can come back and we can haunt these guys!
Yeah, I had a date with this guy, and I swear to God, he is her other half.
Oh no. Could I get anyone a coffee or...poison? No? Just for me? Okay.
Why? Because she can sing and play guitar and do both at the same time?
So how are things going with you two? Is she becoming your special someone?
Your kid is seven?! He's really small. Please! Please get the tickets!
Hi, I'm Ben. I'm hospital worker Ben. It's Ben... to the rescue!
After applying the Waxine and linen strips to leg number one,
Listen, Robert's gonna be here any second so, will one of you just tell him?
Oh, well, then you'll have extra seats, you know, for all your tiaras and stuff.
I'm hearing what you're saying, but at our prices everyone needs toner.
Um, well, Max told me about Minsk, so congratulations! This is so exciting!
Oh, look, look, he's closing his eyes. Look, he's opening his eyes.
I dunno, well he got over the "We were on a break" thing really quickly.
I know! Monica's gonna have a baby! Hey, can this count as her something new?
Hang in there, Man With Eye Patch, your tray is coming!
Yeah but if we throw her a party on her birthday, then it's not a surprise.
But there's a whole table of mini-muffin baskets. Which one did you send?
Well, she told me that I'm gonna die this week, so I'm kinda bummed about that.
In the cab, on the way over, Steve blazed up a doobie.
Of course, yeah. You know, a kiss on the cheek wouldn't be totally inappropriate...
Yeah! Ooh, you should come with me! Oh yeah, then I'd have someone to sit with!
Okay! Ooh-ahh, I'm gonna go pack. I'm gonna go pack my ass off!
Nuh-uh. I don't think any of our lives are ever gonna be the same ever again.
I got it for your wedding and I ordered it weeks ago, and it finally got here!
Yes! They called and you didn't get it! Okay, I mean you didn't get it, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
But, I need your germs! I want my cold back! I miss my sexy voice.
"Oh, I have to get my number back. Oh my God. He's gone." Dead on.
Oh yeah, I'm sure. And all of a sudden his hands weren't the problem anymore.
Yeah! Here! Oh no, these are the trick deck. Okay. Here yes. Okay.
No, she just died today! Okay, umm, we're having a memorial service tomorrow.
Oh, I cursed it. So now bad things will happen to he who spends it.
It's Lafite. The '74 Latour is actually drinking quite nicely.
Well, of course it smells really bad. You have your head up a dead animal.
I have new respect for Chandler. All right everybody! It's time to open the presents!
Yeah okay... yeah, your mom... okay... She looks nice, I can talk to her.
Say something! Say anything! Ask her out! She's not your cousin!
It's not like we-we know each other or anything. Or that have anything in common.
So how's your date with your cyberchick going. Ooh, hey, what is all that .
Joey, I just think you're getting worked up over nothing. This is probably just a crush.
Um, no, huh-uh. One of my clients died on the massage table today.
Or we could use it to call China. See how those guys are doing.
Yeah, no kidding, this just proves no good can come from having sex with Ross!
Oh, yeah, oh, I'm sure of it. You should just do it, just sweep and throw me.
Okay, remember that little problem I was having during my fourth month of pregnancy?
I'm Rachel. It's so annoying when I put Emma on the phone to talk with my friends.
Okay, I can fix this! Okay Monica, Rachel thinks all you can talk about is the wedding.
So have you decided on a band for the wedding? Because, y'know, I'm kinda musical.
All right. Hold on. I got it. Nickel! How much more do we need?
Hey! You guys, I'm writing a holiday song for everyone. Do you want to hear it?
Can you believe this. In, like, two hours I'm gonna have a dad. Eeeshk.
Well, there was this one kid who had a sticker on his backpack that said-
Y'know you guys were a lot more supportive when I wanted to make denim furniture.
Yeah, by the way, good luck in your next life as a dung beetle.
Why, do I have a feeling that's not as happy as it sounds? No! Nooooo!!!
You know if you want, we can sneak the dog back in and Chandler wouldn't even know.
Ok, so, ok, was he holding you? Or was his hand like on your back?
Yeah. And believe me, this suit does not do justice to what's underneath it.
I think she took it pretty well. You know Paolo's over there right now, so...
So wow, it looks like you took care of everything. Thanks a lot, co-host.
Oh, yeah! Back then y'know, we called the Great War. It really was!
Yes. Definitely! Yes! Let's live in an apartment that we both live in!
It's very weird! I don't want some guy down there telling me, I'm y'know, dilatedamundo!
Well, not so good. Upstate's pretty big, he's pretty small, you do the math.
What? What? You guys, what is going on? You not like Robert? Why are you laughing?!
Because I just didn't know how much I wanted it. And I love you, and I wanted to live with you.
I'm sorry, but I just wrote the best dance song for your wedding. Check this out.
Wow! It's huge! It's so much bigger than the cubicle. Oh, this is a cube.
This isn't a good deed, you just wanted to get on TV! This is totally selfish.
But, let's play this one first. And remember whoever talks first loses!
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. If you... If you want your key back, I totally understand.
All right, well I just wanted to say thank you though for diverting Kyle's ex.
Ah-ha! Okay, Las Vegas 1, London 0! I'll be right back.
Yeah, okay. Hey, wait. Do you know what kind of birth control she was using?
I KNOW THAT!!! You have to stop her!! She's going to ruin the wedding!!
Oh, Ross, Mon, is it okay if I bring someone to your parent's anniversary party?
Hey, guys, you know what Larry would say? He would say, "See you ladle."
Oh, look! There's Monica and Chandler! Hey! Hey, you guys! Hey! Ohh!! Ohh! Ahh-ahhh!!
Alright you guys, we can't turn on each other, Okay? That's just what she wants.
Oh hey, you guys, look! Ugly Naked Guy is putting stuff in boxes!
Are you lying? Is this like that time you tried to convince us that you were a doctor?
Umm, you might even say that she pulled a Monica. She doesn't know we switched it.
That's odd, 'cause this dog's been living here for the past 3 days
Sorry Frank, I'm kinda in the middle of the last favor you asked me to do.
Oh hey hi, he's doing it. He's breaking down the door. Okay, we're in.
Oh my God. This is where you got all our stuff, Pottery Barn! Oh my God!
Oh, ooh, Soap Opera Digest, oh that's one of my favorite digests.
Okay! It's worth it, if it will get you moving. You haven't worked in months.
No they ran out of "It's a girl" but I can fix this one, See?
I can't. I can't believe I have plans, I can't. Can you do it tomorrow night though?
Yeah, I thought I had one a couple of minutes ago, and now I know that was definitely one.
Yeah, and what a great way to say, "I secretly love you, roommate's girlfriend!"
Yeah, yeah, no, I don't, I don't know. But, y'know what, maybe it's just all for the best?
No it's just that I got this new pager and I have it on vibrate. See ya!
Okay, you said I could sing at your wedding so, I'm just gonna need a small deposit.
Well I'm sorry Rachel, but I'm not like you, ok? Not everyone can afford help.
I can't believe it. Did you tell your board about how kids want to hear the truth?
Oh, wait a minute it's not gonna be Baby Girl? I thought that was so original!
Yes! I will have the green salad, umm the house salad, and water's fine.
Oh, poor little Tooty is scared to death. We should find his owner.
My guy is a lawyer who has volunteer work. And, he has one of these
Hello handsome. Oh God. Oh look at you two. So when did you guys meet?
Woo-Hoo! The curse is broken! I called everybody I know, and everyone is alive.
Well, he's never coming back! Okay? You just cost me eight dollars a week!
I think my boyfriend ever so dreamy, I wonder what our wedding's gonna be like.
We're so stupid! Do you know what's going on in there? They're trying to take Joey!
Until then, General Grant, why don't you set up camp right there.
No no no, doggie please. Oh, I do so wanna love all animals, please no.
Yes, you will be very sad. All right, well I gotta go tell Rachel the good news.
That is so cruel! Why? Why would a parent name their child Bethel?
Yeah you're always singing "Yummy yummy yummy, I've got love in my tummy"
No! Wait! I was just saying that so you'd think I was a good person. Fight for me.
Ok, so now we need, um sage branches and the sacramental wine.
I can't believe you won't just admit it! Okay, just promise me that you won't do anything stupid.
No! Seven rats! I think we should take them home, we need feed them.
Well look-look, okay Ross, Kyle just told me some really bad stuff about her.
: Dear Ms. Green, thank you for your inquiry, however... oh...
I'm a lady Monica, I don't kiss and tell. But this hickey speaks for itself.
You guys, you know what I just realized? 'Joker' is 'poker' with a 'J.' Coincidence?
Yes, they are expected presently. Yeah, yeah um, their arrival is in the offing.
No, yeah, we never find them! She's always best at us that wily minx.
Well, I would love to but...the bike got stolen and the police have no suspects.
Yeah! And if you wanna look 19, then you... You gotta do something about your eyes.
...so this guy was all And I'm all, Buffay, Homicide. It was just so cool!
Okay, I guess. I mean... I don't know, it's just, I guess I know it's going to be over soon.
Y'know what, you should like, you should buy a state and then just name it after yourself.
What about, what about when I said y'know about the apartment pants, how dumb was I?
You know like... uh okay... uh... 'Could that report be any later?'
Okay If you guys have microphones in there too, I didn't mean any of that. I love you.
Terry's a jerk, and he won't let me work, and I hate Central Perk!
Well, it seems like there weren't any tears 'til you showed her the bill.
It's not mine, I didn't earn it, if I kept it, it would be like stealing.
Are there anymore from the good batch? 'Cause we could just work off of those.
Well, you said that you had customers lined up in the street, so I am here to entertain!
Which means she had a couple spritzers and a quick peck on the cheek.
I don't know. I mean, she obviously has some kind of unfinished business. Sit up!
You know, it's a lot less surprising to do that after I've buzzed you into the building.
Good. Oh oh! Roger's having a dinner thing and he wanted me to invite you guys.
Well I don't think it's very nice of you to park here, y'know you're blocking the entrance.
Yeah, I did. I think it sounds y'know big sistery, y'know, 'Frank's always late.'
Wow, money and a firm hand. Finally a Chandler I can get on board with.
Yeah, yeah, no it's OK 'cause, I mean, I know he's there, so, that's enough for now.
Hamburger. McDonald's. Old MacDonald had a farm, my dad is a pharmacist.
So, how are things going with crazy? Has she cooked your rabbit yet?
A little mirror that when you look into it you see yourself as an old woman.
After he passed out, we put the sand around him to keep him warm.
I'm telling you, if you want to take care of that thing, you should go to my herbal guy.
Just, 'cause, I don't want her to go through what I went through with Carl- oh!
Are you ready for your Scottish massage? Put your face in the hole, lassy.
Maybe because you never listen to anything that I say. I talk about her all the time! DENISE!!!!!
No, no maybe 'cause it's harder to raise them, and the added expense, and...
Phoebe, just watch that, I promise it will resotre all your faith in humanity.
Did you, did you touch any of the guitars while you were there? Did you?!
Y'know what? I'm not talking to you! You go back to sleep! And you, are you a rapist?!
Uh huh yeah there's just something umm, there's something you should know Vicrum just called.
All right, well, I just can't think about that right now. I just wanna say good-bye to my Grandma.
Oh, okay. Excuse me sir? Could you come with me please? You have a phone call.
That wasn't a date! That was, that was just friends getting together... having sex.
No, it's not! We were just goofing around and I dared him to try them on.
Thank you! God, no! You should see me when... Oh actually, no, I look pretty good.
Ross, you're tired. You've been looking all night. And clearly you suck at this.
If you would've let me finish, it goes on to say that he's probably not gay.
Rachel has something that she wants to tell you and umm, I believe that this is your red sweater.
I'D Better Go. Just Over Here I don't want to miss the fight.
Well actually you're the one person I can't tell this too. And the one person I want to the most.
Or, we can decide by whose ever name is closer to the word phone.
Well, we were um, sorta invited to go skiing, y'know Rachel's sister's cabin.
Okay, let's discuss Rachel's birthday. I say we throw a surprise party this weekend.
Okay, look I-I-I do something nice, okay? I'll-I'll fill her ice trays.
Thank you. Can you believe no-one between my apartment and here offered to do that for me?
A-ha! And... what is bluffing? Is it not another word for... lying?
Ooh. Oh. It looks like, like a tiny little person drowning in your cereal.
Smoked a joint? You know, lit a bone? Weed? Hemp? Ganja?
I bought them off Ebay! They used to belong to the late Shania Twain.
Because it's Arabian princess day at work! Okay?! Leave me alone!
Yeah, her first day on a new spiritual plane and she's gonna come to the coffeehouse!
You'd better get back in that kitchen Monica, the garlic is not gonna overuse itself.
And this time, they've ganged up to form one giant, super hat.
Not if nothing happens. Why can't... why can't we just hang out as friends?
All right. No, no, no, not a Richard thing, just put down the glass. And get out!
Ooh, is it someone in this building? Is it that tall guy from the first floor?
I'm not going along with some lie you made Ross, No I'm just gonna be honest with him.
No, yeah, we never find them! She's always best at us, that wily... minx.
Yeah, well, we'll see about that. Can I use your phone? I just wanna call everyone I know.
No-no, I know that, but I just have to make enough money for the second part of my plan.
Ooh, I gotta go. I found a guy that who could fix up the van for catering.
Ok, well, who identified the tone of this restaurant as pretentious comma garlicky?
See no-no, I made a batch and I froze it, and this is the only one left.
nothing, I'm excited about our date, Mike this is Ross Geller this is Mike Haaaaa.
Um-mmm, and I won't have to go there anymore because I gave them my correct address.
It's amazing! My headache is completely gone! What are those pills called?
Ok, I didn't see it, because I was putting on my jacket, but I uh want to believe you.
All righty. I'll be back in-in a little bit. Unless you wanna come with me?
Oh OK. Oh no, oh it's gone, that's so weird, I don't know how-where it went.
Yeah, and-and leaving us to go see hot dancer girls is not very Thanksgivingy.
Or! I should rush through dinner with Joey and I can meet David at 9:00!
Listen! You have to help me pick a dress 'cause I'm meeting Mike's parents tonight!
Right, yeah, ok, I'll ask the butler to fetch my diamonds out of the vault.
We just have to really, really, really, not let stuff like money get--is that a hickey?
Oh? Isn't that funny? I didn't see that before, I wouldn't have let her go up again.
Hello "ja", it's time for your massage, ja! Put your face in the hole.
That's funny, no. Cadillac, cataract, I get it, no I get it, you stay out there.
Wait for me! Wait for me! Wait for me! Oh cool, this is my first huddle.
What when Yeller saves saves the family from the wolf and everyone's happy?
I know no, no, y'know you don't deserve this, you don't Ross. You're, you're really, you're so good.
Yeah I mean it's probably nothing, but I just wanted to warn you that there might be something there.
Wow, a house for dolls, that is so cool! When I was kid, I had a barrel.
This is completely normal, around the fourth month your hormones start going crazy.
Come on, you know, Thanksgiving. Ooh, you got the bigger half. What'd you wish for?
So, what are we gonna do? Are we just gonna go ahead and set them up with people?
No! I'm not finished yet! Don't! Don't you dare hang up on me!!!
And then. I would use y'know the strongest tool at my disposal. My sexuality.
Yeah well, she certainly knew what she was doing New Year's Eve 1997.
Yes, and I'm sorry. I-I know things worked out for Chandler and Monica, but that's very rare.
There isn't time. You must leave everything. They'll take care of you next door.
No, the 'No Smoking' sign. There's no smoking in my Grandmother's cab.
Yes, and her boyfriend. But we're celebrating Thanksgiving in December 'cause he is lunar.
Would you stop already? Get out of the bitter barn and play in the hay.
Okay, so when you're done with your tea I'll look at your leaves and tell you your fortune.
Yeah the material feels so soft-hello Mr. Bicep! Have you been working out?
Oh wait, I change my mind! Okay, let's talk about the party! I have so many ideas!
Wait. Why was he yelling at her? He's the one who slept with someone else.
Cliff, do you really believe that a character from a TV show was here in your room?
Oh God, I'm so glad you guys are happy, I was so afraid you were going to be all freaked.
Oh, I took Larry there to eat but it was all violated. So we shut it down!
Oh, if I were, would-would I have shooting pains up and down my left arm?
Oh, you are so going to Minsk. You belong in Minsk. You can't stay here just 'cause of me.
Yeah, um, she was 82 years old. Her name was um, Mrs. Adelman.
Hmm, something bad to tell Rachel... Bad news for Rachel, what could that be?!
For your information, this happens to be a pain like no man will ever experience.
Yeah! Let's do it! Let's live together! Oh god, we're really going to move in together!
Okay Joey? Chandler's here, he was wondering... Okay, I guess he ran out of change.
Yeah, well, I'm very angry at him, because he slept with me and never called me back.
Ahh, toilet seat covers! Is that what you were doing while I was getting gas?
No, nothing like that. I was just...such a dummie. I taught this "massage-yourself-at-home-workshop." And they are.
I know. Oh, like you would drink her coffee after what you did to her with Van Damme.
Oh! Here it is! Ooh, Joey! Why did you sign it, "Son of a bitch?"
Tiger! Dragon! Iceberg!! Joseph, did you even study at all last night?
A stripper at a bachelor party, that is so clich. Why don't you get a magician?!
Yeah, I... Well y'know I-I mean I missed the-the semi-finals, so I'd just be lost.
No, listening! Sit! Y'know, maybe it would just really, really help if you would just talk.
Yes. Yes! Fine! I am someone! You want me to say it? I have doubts! I'm sorry!
Yeah... but you should know, I also have a jar of vaseline and a cat skull in here.
And on my way over here, I stepped in gum. ...What is up with the universe?!
Oh, um, it was nice. Took him to a romantic restraunt, ordered champagne, nice.
It's a video of my friend giving birth. Could you just bring it back to your apartment?
I don't know, they both want to live in a house of cheese! I don't know how you fight that.
Well, 'cause then they'd be like my mom used to make them, you know, before she died.
Wait a minute! So when Emily comes you're just, you're not gonna see Rachel anymore?
Yeah, I think it was better when you guys were sad. Hey, uh, remember the roller blades?
I know that, but look, we've got the Powerball number, we've won 3 dollars!
Will it? Will it?! I mean, how would you feel if you found out you were 31?
I know, it's tough. You know what the first thing I did after my mother's funeral was?
I can hear traffic and birds! I can hear the voices in my head again! I'm kidding.
No! No! Look at that! It's a line of ants! They're working as a team!
Okay. Okay but you should know though, I've raised my rates to $200 an hour.
No, I'm-I'm not sure about Hulk, but I like the idea of a name starting with "The."
Okay! Oh my God! My first bike! Thank you for the best present I've ever gotten.
I'm just gonna pass on the concert, 'cause I'm just not in a very Hootie place right now.
I'm sorry. It was just so funny when you started comparing Jane Eyre to Robocop.
Oh, this is so exciting! You get your picture back up on the wall of fame! Eek!
Fine, all right, mine had a dwarf that got broke in half, but y'know whatever.
Of course you can take a couple days off work because this trip includes me!
Oh, ok, murder, cancer, soccer teams eating each other in the Andes.
Okay. Oh no-no-no, you don't touch the guitar! First you learn here, then you learn here.
Yeah. So, we can do it tomorrow night, you guys. It's Valentine's Day. It's perfect.
Bye! We said good-bye at the door so as not to flaunt our new love.
Okay, well I think that they're in my purse. Why don't you go get dressed and I'll look for them.
Hey you guys, I don't mean to make things worse, but umm, I don't want to live with Rachel anymore.
Stop it! Stop it, before someone gets really hurt! Here David, you should just go.
OK, I just need two... the, um, ten of spades and the six of clubs.
Wow! Oh you can just imagine that this is where they kept all the stuff to make their potions.
Yes, thank you. You see, this is how normal people are supposed to react to drums.
Oh.Okay, then it gets worse, 'cause then I told him that I would see him tomorrow night.
You don't have to do that, Ross and Joey aren't here, you can watch the parade if you want.
Yes! Now, she feels terrible! She really wants to make up! You gotta find her.
Uh, Ross, those are the only lines we have, sorry. OK, you guys, once more.
Aw, and I was gonna ask you to marry me because I forgot to say hello to you last week.
Oh-ho yeah! A song with rhyming words. Oo, I never thought of that before.
least you've been married, OH MY GOD! I wanna trade lives with Ross.
Oh, did the little rich boy have a problem with the butler? Yes, mine's worse!
Uh-huh, got it. Ooh, I'm gonna see my dad. Wish me luck, Grandpa! Commercial
Yeah, I saw the article on your coffee table and I memorized the title to freak you out!
Some guy bought it. I'm sorry. I tired to stop it but they put me in jail!
Oh. It was a long shot. Hey, you guys can I just like have a second alone with the babies.
Oh, I knew something had to be wrong, because my fingernails did not grow at all yesterday.
Huh. So now, the real question is, who put those fossils there, and why?
Yes, I was going to incorporate that. Oh good, here's Monica, she'll have something nice to say.
God, I woke the beast. Sorry. I was wrong obviously, I just-I misspoke. It's okay.
I'm on top of the world, looking down on creation and the only explanation I can find...
No! Think about it, it's a taxi that people take when they need to relax, it's...
Good that's a good one. Okay, Monica, anything? Y'know? Does Rachel move the phone pen?
Yu-huh. That's when my mother would shut off the TV and say 'The end'.
No! No! I just went to pick up Phoebe Buffay's checks; there were a lot of them.
I can't say, I just thought it was really good... and... maybe would be worth something some day.
Oh God, here we go. For the first time in my life I'm gonna say 'Hi birthfather'.
Wow, this is it, I'm gonna meet my dad. This is like the biggest thing ever, huh.
I know, I'm sorry! But y'know, this ring is better! Monica never even saw the other ring.
Oh! Which can either mean you're having a baby or you're gonna make a scientific discovery!
Well, I think it's great that the medical community is finally trying to help sick hamsters.
Well, how could it not be breezy, no, 'cause, you're, you're in such a breezy place.
Oh, no, no, no, no. You know what, he's not into that stuff anymore. He quit for me.
Ugh, it's so exhausting waiting for death. Ohh, by the way, do you think you could-
Yes. Once. Yeah, a little. He kinda did it to himself. It's not really a good story.
You're Elizabeth's father, huh? I can see now where she gets her rugged handsomeness.
Oh! Get off!! Ow!! Oh, stop it!! Why?! Why are you doing that to me?!
Oh well, all right, I got thank you, I got uh, this y'know "I want a job sweater."
Oh, so this is all about money! Y'know it's bad enough that-Ow! Oh, you have got to be kidding!
Um, that's ok! Ok. All right. Now we need the semen of a righteous man.
No offence but, y'know sometimes it's hard to understand you, y'know with the accent, so...
All good, thanks. Do you maybe have a nickname have like a nickname that's easier to rhyme?
Ya know, in all the years that we have been grandmother and granddaughter, you have never lied to me.
I don't-Look I don't know what you're complaining about now? You were both aware of the situation!
Congratulations! I didn't want to say anything in front of Joey 'cause I didn't know if he knew yet.
Oh, and great! You might as well bring me my book, it's on the counter in your apartment.
Hey, you guys! Look what I found! Look at this! That's my Mom's writing! Look.
Oh! I know! It's because... he's gorgeous, and he's charming, and when he looks at you...
Oh, it's already closed, Chris gave me the keys to lock up-what is wrong?
I can't believe I'm gonna have a party! This is so great! A party! Yay!! I don't know why.
All right I... I gotta call my mom and ask her a left handed cooking question.
Okay, fine, I'll move. Alright, you don't have to manhandle me. Where? Okay. Thank you. Wach.
Oh God. Remember the girls' nights we used to have sitting around talking about you and Ross?
All I could think of was y'know, "Is he gonna kiss me? Is he gonna kiss me?"
Oh, do I have a middle name. All right Monica Velula Geller. It's that bedroom there.
You knew this and you never said anything?! With all the stupid dinosaur stuff you tell us?!
You apologize to the tree right now or I am calling for backup. Backup! Backup!!
Stop it! Stop it no! That's not fair! Y'know I can't resist that beautiful voice!
All right, don't freak out! Okay? I-I will help you. How long before you have to leave?
Its fine. I mean, this is something that you've been thinking about since you were what, 14?
Yeah I know. Isn't it great? One less person we have to make small talk with.
Oh, it's a secret. Oh goodie! Yes! We haven't done the secret thing in a long time.
Alright, don't say that. He's probably always been dull. You just, you know, set it free.
Okay, let's get some perspective people; it's not like I'm wearing a seeing-eye dog coat!
Oh my God! Why would you play hide and seek with someone you know is a flight risk?!
Don't worry, don't worry. We'll come up with a good lie. I'll help you practice it.
Okay. But the question is who's gonna go first. 'Cause whoever goes second is the bitch.
So, what? Monica, we have the winning ticket! My psychic said I was gonna win, remember?
I've had that dog there for three days and Chandler had no idea. He's not so smart.
No. No! No! ...So, um, do you think he's doing any better than he was this morning?
G-sharp? Have you been studying the real names of the chords? Have you? Oh my God!
This used to be your room? Wow! You must've been in really good shape as a kid.
Was it my work? Were they mad? Was it Jack? Did he yell?!
Hi. Y'know in England this car would be on the other side of the store. Woo!
We've got the ground-up flesh of formerly cute cows and turkeys, ew...
No that's just me coughing! Oh, good, there you are! Listen, um, I have a dog in my room.
Wow! And I'm a vegetarian! All right, all right, well I'm sorry, we'll put some ice on it.
And tell them that in 2 weeks I will once again be a masseuse in good standing!
Oh. Well umm, okay here's a weird thing. My mother was also a supply manager.
Y'know, I don't-I don't think it's you. This is a freaky place. Hey! Guys! Oh no, it's you.
Well, yeah, but... no. I mean, umm... doesn't.... doesn't Russ just remind you of someone?
You guys you really should get rid of those animals. They shouldn't be living in an apartment.
Well at least all my songs don't taste like garlic. Yeah, there are other ingredients Monica.
Okay, dinosaur attack!! Quick, everybody into the house!! Ahh-ahh! Roof! Rrroof-roof-roof!
Oh, hey, Mon, do you still have your like old blouses and dresses from high school?
So, so far is this trip to Vegas better or worse than the trip to London?
Okay, so what do you think ladies? Who wouldn't be interested? Who wouldn't want to date him?
Okay, is this the day of good news or what? I got us a job! The wedding reception.
I wouldn't say never, you know there's that guy well what about ok well there's gotta be someone.
Okay, whatever you say. But just be careful, all right? Rachel's not in the same place you are.
Yeah, I can see where I'd be your best shot but, no. I'm sorry, but I think it's twisted.
So he's probably really nervous around women, y'know? Maybe, you just have to make the first move.
Well, okay, fine, use my happy place. Okay, I'm just gonna, I have to ask that you don't move anything.
Okay. Ooh, I see a ladder. Which can mean either a promotion or a violent death.
No. They said you 'Weren't believable as a human being.' So, you can work on that.
When I got pregnant with the triplets, I took that test like three times just to make sure.
Happy thirtieth birthday! Here! It's for the child in you, and the woman. Happy thirtieth!
Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs!
That's the same month as Halloween. So, um, what kinda things do you like to do at home?
Ooh, this is cool...it says in some parts of the world, people actually eat the placenta.
Oh, but, could we not go together? I,I don't wanna be the geek that invited the boss.
All right, I already didn't give them back to you, that's what I said. Where is that other earring?
Y'know, for once, I am going to sit down and try to watch one of these things. .
Oh no, I know! I know! It's the one where Joey got Monica's turkey stuck on his head!
Eh, don't be so hard on yourself. If someone I was still in love with was getting married...
I really don't want to mess up what we have. I'm just-I'm worried it's gonna be a big mistake.
There we go.You know what, if we were in prison, you guys would be, like, my bitches.
Did you ever feed him a poison capsule that made him bleed from the eyes?
Ooh, three points. Both fine answers, but we were looking for leafy, leafy.
No, I just heard when people live together, they split the cost of stamps. Don't they?
What does that mean? Does he sell it, drink it, or just complain a lot?
Yeah. But Sergei said it took the Germans six weeks to get all the way across it.
Okay, you can totally say no, but umm, would it be okay with you if I set Ross up on a date?
Oh. Oooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! My butt cheek is waking up! Oooh! Ooh!
Well, Ursula is a waitress and-and she lives in Soho. And Phoebe, is on this couch.
All right well let's see, Ross is a good father, but Joey has a boat-This is hard!
Umm, wow. This-this isn't gonna be easy. Umm, I don't think we should see each other anymore.
Then he comes over! "I'm so worried about you." Uck! Be a man!
You're just so mean to each other! And I don't want to end up like that with Rachel. I still like you!
I do! I do! I do! I do! Ugh, like I can really chase you. I'm carrying a litter.
Um, not so good. He walked me to the subway and said 'We should do this again!'
He said, "Nice to meet you Glenda." Well, obviously I couldn't give him my real name?
I'm telling you he's dead. What we are about to have here is a dead fat guy on a stick.
See? And you don't care if people are staring, it's just for a second cause then you're gone!
Thanks, hi. Um, I wanna start with a song that means a lot to me this time of year.
Hell, I'm drunk right now! What? I can't have a mimosa with breakfast?! I'm on vacation!
Are you two talking about the same baby? Hey! Have you started off thinking of names yet?
Really, it doesn't mean anything. I mean, you know, Monica refers to Chandler as Richard all the time!
You know, I might know somebody. Hey, how about you set me up with someone, and we double date!
I'm sorry... I'm sorry. It's obviously way too early for us to be... having that conversation.
YOU DID NOT!!!! Oh! No! You came up with Relaxi Cab! That's not good.
Well, yeah! But I'm not gonna take anymore crap. Okay? No more Mrs. Nice Bucket!
I know. Then, I'm gonna marry Chandler for the money and you'll marry Rachel and have the beautiful kids.
I've never driven it! Okay? Not once! Okay once. Okay, I drive it all the time.
And I have your name and the fact that you're a drifter, so the ball's pretty much in your court.
Goodie! Thanks. So, how is it living with Rachel again? I mean, apart from the great food.
Oh let me guess, and you wanna have them all at the same time and you wanna have them for your brother.
When I was you! Y'know what, it's all Joey's fault, 'cause he left his nose open!
She's just so cute! I just wanna bite her ear off and use it and a sucking candy.
Who are you kidding? You just find some guy off the street for me? Oh God! This is humiliating!
You guys, we said we were gonna have fun! Come on, hey, remember the time... You don't remember?
W-w-I just-it's that-I have-y'know I have-I have an appointment. And it's very important.
Joey, this is Mary Ellen Jenkins. So, Mike, how do you and Joey know each other anyway?
Okay, Jasmine, can you, can you ask Mr. Whiffler if he can wait for like five minutes.
Um, is, is there any chance that you're rounding up? You know, like from, like 20?
Yes, when I first met you, you were like, "Blah, blah, blah." I was like, shhh!
No, no, we don't really have time for this right now. Okay, we have to keep Chandler away from my bedroom.
Oh, okay, I learned how to shoot a lay-up, a foul shot, and a twenty-three pointer.
The exclamation point in the title scares me. Y'know, it's not just Freud, it's Freud!
I know! I guess I am! Oh my god! Load up the Volvo I want to be a soccer mom!
Yeah, I had a massage client who worked there and-and he said I had a knack for stocks.
Y'know what, it doesn't matter what you say it's not gonna make a difference anyway, so you can just go.
I know, I know. So sweet... and so complicated. And for a shrink, he's not too shrinky, y'know?
Perhaps because you gave her an engagement ring? Y'know Ross doctors are supposed to be smart.
Excuse me! Can you tell me where I can find Earl? He's the supply manager around here.
I just really wanted to apologize again and... and also show you something I think you'll find very exciting.
I don't think it would have sold a million copies but it would have made a nice gift for you.
No, I just feel like being by myself for a while. All right? I'll see you guys later. Thanks.
Well, all right. 1700 bags of peanuts flying that high, that's pretty amazing too.
Ross, went to get a cab so we can all... No, wh-what are you doing! No, Monica, no!
But Joey, you're gonna be fine. You don't need that show, it was just a dumb soap opera.
I'm... I'm just... I'm the worst person ever. How can I not tell David that I'm seeing Mike?
Oh, I'm sorry. Is that annoying? And speaking about being selfish in bed, how's Whitney?
Yeah, I think I told it wrong. Y'know, we should talk about that because I don't totally understand what happened there.
But Monica, he loves his job so much! Can you just give him another chance? Please?
Um, I'm gonna go meet Duncan, he's skating tonight at the Garden, he's in the Capades.
Yes, and then I realized I'm against that, and uh, so then we bought some, uh, boobs.
Oh! Oh! Oh! Okay, fine, fine. Now I don't feel so bad about sleeping with Jason Hurley.
Can I borrow the phone? I want to call my apartment and check on my grandma. What's my number?
No, no, you can get one yourself. It'll be on the house! Y'know what are big sisters for?
I like waking up with you too. Oh! It's such a beautiful morning. Oh, I can stay here all day.
Listen to you two. It's so sad. Looks like I'm gonna be going to the goddess meetings alone.
It's just y'know, been a couple of hours, and she hasn't called. Not that I even care, y'know.
Well the Lions technically won, but it was a moral victory for the Green Bay...Mermen.
I don't-she said y'know that I'd have triplets! But she also said one of them would be black.
Oh! Oh, I can't believe it! I mean I think it's great! For him. She might be able to do better.
The voice woman. Ya know, I mean, she has a great voice but she doesn't have a video.
Well let's just hope it works. Y'know nine out of ten marriages end in divorce?
Okay so, we'll just come up with some kind of signal if it's going well you can take off.
Uh-huh, me too. Ross, maybe I should've specified that I'd be needing a grown up doctor.
Yeah... Oh Bitsy, hi. Uhm... listen I just wanted to thank you again for having me here tonight.
Oh yeah, oh and I know, but this isn't what it looks like, 'cause Rick is my ahh, husband.
Are you asking me out? 'Cause it would be kinda weird since you just broke up with my sister.
Your hair looks too good, I think it would upset her. Ross, why don't you come on in.
Yeah. I was just in there. He introduced himself and the next thing I know, we're making out. You know.
Huh, well, the girls in the satin nighties on the commercial don't seem to think it's that bad.
Yes, but I wanted you to want to live with me, but okay, if you're having so much fun over here...
What about me? I just found out that Denise is leaving town for a while, I don't have a roommate.
That's easy! You just have to think of him as a-as a jar of pickles that won't open.
Coming through! Oh! Coming through! Oh! Hello! Hi! No! Right! Coming through!
No, I-I mean your-your old best friend, here. Lily, from high school. Remember?
Save it Red! Unless you wanna spend the night in the slammer, you apologize to the tree.
Oh! Alright. Well I think the reason people laugh is becuase it's a play on the word roomy.
A real man wouldn't just run to the hospital! No! What would, what would Krog do?
Chandler's knees. Chandler's... ankles. Chandler's ankle hair. Oh no. Okay, you're all set.
We did! We violated Section 12 Paragraph 7 of the criminal code!
Oh, yeah! Are you telling me you... you're not even... a little turned on by Monica, right now?
Oh no! No no! Not at all. We're just moving in right now. See where it goes.
It's amazing! You better hurry up and fill out an application or I'm gonna beat you to it.
Okay, I didn't understand that, but y'know, maybe that's 'cause you were speaking the secret language of love!
You mean the time you broke the ketchup bottle and cleaned it up with Monica's guest towels?
It's me. It's Phoebe. Listen there's something in here I want to eat, what-what smells so good?
Ya, you know, Rachel ... she'll do whatever you want. Y'know, you can just walk all over her.
Yeah, it's totally meant to be. Tell him who you originally wanted to hook up with that night.
Yep, we shook on it. Yeah but believe me that is not how he wanted to seal the deal.
Well, I'm returning a call from a certain mom at the B-E-A-C-H. I just spelled the wrong word.
Okay, this is going to be harder than I thought. Umm, let's try some uh, aversion therapy.
Ooh, y'know what, I think it's time for puppy to go out again. Come on, let's go to the balcony.
You're kidding! And he plays rugby?! That's so funny. Ohh! I see how you did that. All right.
There is nothing wrong with Jake! Okay? He is all man! I'm thinking even more than you.
Oh, great. Great. You're doing great, you know real strong. Going strong. Keep going.
So okay what? You're gonna be married to a girl who doesn't even know about it?!-Op, woman! Sorry.
No! No, you can't arrest me! No!! I won't go back! I won't go back to that hell hole!!
Yeah, oh, Princess Leia and the gold bikini, every guy our age loved that.
Then what's wrong with them? Would they not go with your tiny portions of pretentious food?
How can people do that?... Oh, you guys, look! Ugly Naked Guy got gravity boots!
No, that's my stepdad. My real dad's the one that ran out on us before I was born.
Wow, so glad I changed. Almost wore my ??? outfit that can't contain my breasts.
Not great, but we can work on it at lunch. Okay, I can be at your apartment in two hours.
Five? Okay, where am I giving birth, a hospital or a big box under the stairs?
Okay, y'know what, you don't have to do that now. No-no-no-no!! Not him, you don't! Well the moment's over.
Well I guess it's okay to open one more if it's part of a set. Y'know, it's probably this one.
Okay, this is what I'm talking about, this. I-I need to live in a land where people can spill.
No no no, I'll be nice, I swear!!! Could you just give me the number for where they are?
Oh my God! This is a six-hour pill! That's it! I'm out of the woods! Ohh! What a relief!
You know.. you let your guard down, you start to really care about someone, and I just- I-
Okay, so The Plaza! Okay, we'll get us some Mai Thai's, maybe no more for you though.
Ok, there is no top. That's the beauty of Smelly Cat. Um, why don't you just follow me?
Ok, and I have the, uh receipt for my dinner with Nokululu Oon Ah Ah.
So how did this happen? Did she, did she lure you to an early bird dinner?
So long! Don't let the best door in the world hit you in the ass on your way out!
So. This has always been Monica's bed, what you're just noticing now, how self-involved are you?
Yeah! Yeah! Convince her that-that you're scared of commitment! Convince her that you're a little coward!
You know, it's so surprising that you and Joey have known each other for so long and I've never heard about you.
OK, look, see, this is him. My mother gave me this picture before she died, same guy.
I thought I'd try to take a walk. Would you pour me some water? I'll be back soon.
That's good, you should be impulsive and you should be romantic. Just...you did it with the wrong person. What?
No! There-there was a little, a little diff in the market and I lost 13 million dollars.
This is madness. It's madness, I tell you, for the love of God, Monica, don't do it!! ...Thank you.
... with the double double double-jointed boy. Hey. So um, are you the professional guitar player?
I know, I know, we can drive, we can vote, we can work, what more do these broads want?
No. No! It's just y'know first, I wanna take off all my clothes and have you rub lotion on me.
Well, I mean look it's, it's not your fault, you know. I mean this is just what, what she does to guys, okay.
Wow. So, okay, maybe that means that, you're not over Ross yet and you have issues with your father.
Ohh, you and your ways. Since it's Christmastime. I'm going to be one of those people collection donations.
I'm doing okay. I think it's going well. Do you think they're having fun? Am I talking to fast?
Oh, I-I gave them the puppy and it made them so happy that I decided I'm gonna carry their baby.
Oh, now you're sad and creepy, oh. You know what, I, I'm sorry I quit, okay, I just quit.
Uh-huh. Okay. Okay, don't you think, maybe, though, it's just that he's so perceptive that it freaks you out?
Hey, tell him about Relaxi-Taxi, and-and ask him if he thinks that's better than Relaxi Cab.
Well, uhm, back in my mugging days, you know, I, uhm, I worked St. Marc's Comics.
Sorry. ..Y'know, those stupid soda people gave me seven thousand dollars for the thumb.
Yeah. . . I'm sorry. We weren't really looking for anything to happen with you guys. I, I have a boyfriend.
I'm so jealous you're all going! I can't believe I never knew that you can't fly in your third trimester!
Okay umm, I'd also like to try on the tiara. Oh yeah. Okay. What do you think, too much?
OH!! Oh I thought they were just watching me. You know, like at, like at an aquarium, ya know.
Okay. Good, all right, let's get back in the car, 'cause it's freezing, and my chest is unsupported.
Yes!! Yes! Yes! Yes!! That's my Dad, that's Frank! Yeah! I'm sorry I'm getting all flingy.
I'm sorry Monica but I knew if I told you, you'd get really, like, judgemental and you would not approve.
What am I supposed to do? Ask every guy I make out with if he's married? No, yeah, I should.
Hi, Bubbles. Manly. Well, I just thought I would drop by and let you know how it went with Joey.
Well, at least you didn't rent yours from a store called, "It's Not Too Late."
Yeah. Oh, except one of the strings on my guitar is broken. Hey, Chandler, can I borrow your G-string?
Maybe that's because you haven't taken the time to get to know him. Let's remedy that, shall we?
All right. All right! If he wants a date? He's gonna get a date. All right, I'm gonna go in.
Okay, my turn. My turn. Oh! You're so cute! Oh, I could squeeze your little head! I won't.
Wait! But Ross if they don't get along then you should smooth things over. Make them be friends.
Well, look, why don't you just, why don't you do your Phase Two strip club thing with us.
Okay but if you don't find him and bring him back, I am gonna hunt you down and kick your ass!
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! No, no, you don't want that one. No, you can have this cool brown one.
Hi! Hi! Listen, my friend Ross is about to be divorced for the third time, but wouldn't you date him?
Okay, so I'm done my part, okay. It's your responsibility now, okay. The burden is off me, right?
No. What do you, what do you want me to be, like some stupid, big, like, purple dinosaur?
Don't be so negative! Good God! Isn't it possible that Sorry is sitting in there right now?!
Give me your hands. Strings. Gimme it! Pick. Do you want to learn to play guitar?
Yeah, but you've known Rachel since High School and you cannot just cut her out of your life.
Ohh. Um-hmm. But y'know, she choose to find me. I mean, I have to respect her decision. Right?
Yeah well, once again not knocking pays off. I only wish you hadn't been on the toilet.
Just one last time erm... the marriage thing... there's no wiggle room? None at all?
yeah well yeah you know Emma's birth certificate might say Geller but her eyes say Mookurgee.
No! No, her cab! She probably won't be using it; you can drive it to Las Vegas.
Hello. Oh good. Ross could you put up some of these flyers for me? OH!! Demon!! Demon!!
Well, it just, it doesn't feel like playing anymore, it feels like work. It's like I'm working in the field.
Umm, I'm talking about that which you already know but won't admit. You love her again; you re-love her!
Okay, I will find someplace else to do the rest of my appointments. I just don't know what the big deal is!
She's already fluffed that pillow... Monica, you know, you've already fluffed that- -but, it's fine!
Are you kidding? The woman has the nose of a bloodhound ... and the breasts of a Greek goddess.
Chandler, easy, easy. Go to your happy place. La la la la la la la.
Okay but look! Look at what I got! It's her address book! We have a guest list!
Yeah well, maybe she should've spent a little less time decorating and a little more time in the bedroom.
I know! I know, I opened it up and there it was, just floating in there, like this tiny little hitch-hiker!
And! And, they're gonna have a baby! And! And, they want me to grow it for them in my uterus.
I just like him so much that I just feel like I've had 10 drinks today and I've only had six.
Well, why did you make like a whole big thing out of y'know, everyone has to hang out in the big apartment?
It's not kicking me, it's kicking one of the other babies. Oh ! Don't make me come in there!
Well, I'll tell you Rachel Karen Green, I had plans with Joey tonight and he left me this note.
Oh, well um, not right now. Y'know I'm just gonna go to bed, I think the fumes are giving me a headache.
Anyway, OK, now promise you won't like, freak out and say how great this is until I'm done, OK.
There's your movie! Later on. Monica opens her front door. Chandler is sitting in the hallway.
I just talked him into it, don't tell me I have to do you too. The puppet master gets tired people.
I just went to my old apartment to get you the-the cookie recipe and the stupid fire burned it up!
Rachel, come here. Okay, I was just starting to take my Thanksgiving nap, and I had another dream about Jack.
Rach, look! Oh, hi! Where is my strong Ross Skywalker to come rescue me. There he is.
I am one of Ben's mothers. I'm a lesbian. It was, it was difficult coming out to my parents.
Oh, I was just here looking for, um, my um, my part of an old sandwich. Oh, here it is! Oh.
Wow! This place is incredible! Sting's pen...that he gave to Phoebe. Come on! Secret passageway!
Look, she only suspects something okay? She doesn't know for sure, so just throw her off the track.
No. It starts with a "v" and ends with an "x". Helpfully with a "to" in the middle.
Of course I can! It's just good sense to backup your backup! Look, I've already lost Chandler!
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God. You are not gonna believe this. I have just been discovered.
Oh, yeah, he clipped on, he said call him as soon as you get a chance, he's at Flimby's.
Good. Y'know-no-no, okay, it's-it feels like everything's been about me lately, so what's happening with you?
Oh, I have dinner plans with Joey. We get together about once a month to discuss the rest of you guys.
Okay do you-Okay, do you have a search warrant? Because the last time I checked this was still America!
Stop it! Stop it! She keeps squirming, trying to get away! Just like when she was alive.
You could get arrested, right now! All right, yeah, I gotta take it back. I'm totally drunk with power.
Oh, I'm sorry, oh, I just, I thought we could have them whipped and then add some peas and onions.
Yeah! What have you got to lose? Y'know you might even end up with someone really special if you pick my guy.
This is so cool, 'til Monica gets back, it's like I'm head chef and I get to make all the decisions.
I know! Evil! And... and... and... I like Mike so much, you know. It's just going really well. Oh my God!
I thought you were excellent! In fact for a minute there I was like, "Ooh, where'd Ross go?"
Ooh-oh! Someone's wearing the same clothes they had on last night. Someone get a little action?
Y'know, this is probably none of my business, but weren't you guys supposed to not be seen in public together?
Atlantic City, baby! Let's roll some bones! Hey Joey, high-five for rolling bones!
If we are not doing it together, we're not doing it at all! So, say goodbye to your tickets! .
Because this one is now! And-and it's two of our best friends! Who knows what you're gonna marry!
Um, perhaps. Yes! Yes, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I was just afraid that you were still hung up on my sister.
Hi! It's me. And soup. Hey, I just saw Josh, he looks so yummy in your leather jacket.
Because you are so afraid of commitment! You talk to him, make him scared like you! Make him a...man!
Oh please, these guys, we haven't even moved in yet and they have us picking out china patterns.
Smelly cat, smelly cat, what are they feeding you? Smelly cat, smelly cat, it's not your fault.
No, I'm just gonna help him, you know, get 'de-Ursula-ized', like you know, like I did for Joey after he went out with her.
...in Reservations at 8:00 by Neil Simon. Thank-thank you Neil. Thank you for the words.
I feel really strongly about this, Rachel. Please, don't use this gift certificate. I'm asking you as a friend.
Yeah, and it really freaked me out! And after a while I even tried to hurt you and it just spurred you on.
See, I-I think that one that Elton John wrote for, um, that guy on Who's The Boss.
I'm sorry, I-I-I-I don't live here anymore. I-I didn't know how to tell you, but y'know everybody else knows!
Ooh, is that spelled with a 'C' or a 'K'? Oh my God! It doesn't matter; they're both great!
All right, wait just one more second. Hi, it's Phoebe and Rachel's. Please leave a message, thanks!
Oh I-I don't know about that. No, I think that if the two of you had sex the-the-the repercussions would be catastrophic.
I can't believe it! I did it! I rode a bike! I never thought I'd be able to do that! Thank you Ross.
Now Ben, sometimes people may seem like jerks on the outside, but they have famous fathers.
No because I chickened out the last time when I tried to meet him. So I mean coincidences? I don't think so.
Yeah that's true. Yeah, you love her. You always have. You have a child together. There is no right answer.
It's nothing, it's just- Okay. I'm going through my mail, and I open up their monthly, you know, STATEMENT-
Why don't take care of this one, and should I get pregnant again, I'll hold onto your card, okay?
Oh! It's okay, you calm down after a while and then people can see how really sweet and wonderful you really are.
Ohh! I have! I have! I started making these little sock bunnies! Oh for crying out loud!
Yeah well, "excuse me, I ordered the smoked salmon appetizer, but I can't see it, I can't see it"!
Oh, ok, you know what I don't get? The way guys can do so many mean things, and then not even care.
I'm not done yet, OK. God. OK, if that goes well, they may even want to make an album.
No... actually, you might wanna stay away from Jane street... that's where stabby Joe works.
Wait okay, if this game is gonna cause problems between the two of you, then maybe I should just keep it.
So! Ross doesn't really decorate his tree with floss, but you don't hear him complaining do you? God!
They're just talking, and y'know what? Just because I think they're soul mates doesn't mean anything's gonna happen.
Uh-huh. Now you can turn around or you can go in there and rip the Band-Aid off. What to you want to do?
Gosh. I'm not gonna let that man make you eat your baby. Oh. Hey! Who is that guy? I think I know him.
Y'know the only reason he's marrying you is because he thinks all the things you were saying about yourself were true.
I still cannot believe you're engaged! Just 'cause its happening so fast; not 'cause you're such a loser.
Okay, I understand why Superman is here, but why is there a porcupine at the Easter Bunny's funeral?
Hi, Ben. I'm your father. I am... the head. Aaaaaahhhh.... Alright, this barbecue is gonna be very fun.
Oh, I'm so sorry. Um, and maybe I'm wrong! I but-y'know I'm gonna go out with him again, I'll find out more.
Oh. Okay, well I-I was kinda hoping that I would just...be alone y'know to think about my mom and her suicide.
No! I am a positive person. You are like Santa Clause on Prozac, at Disneyland, getting laid!
Thanks! Y'know, that when you say things like that it makes me wanna rip that sweater vest right off!
Nothing, I just thought I'd stop by.. y'know, after the uh... that I.. y'know, so what are you doing here?
No, you can't go. No-no-no, I can't hold this table on my own. If they ask me to move, I cave.
Lather, rinse, repeat, and lather, rinse, repeat, and lather, rinse, repeat, as needed.
No, it's just that he got this new like home theater dealie, and he wants y'know, us to check it out.
Oh, ok. How, it's been so long since you've had sex, you're wondering if they've changed it?
Um, Rachel I'm really sorry. That's okay, do you wanna get back together? Yeah, okay. Did anyone else hear that?!
I can't! I can't! Unless... Well are you saying that-that you would move out if-if I didn't buy that lamp?
Oh my God, you're right! I am too late; they're sitting on the couch and talking! Come on! Rachel?
Yeah! Sure! Yep! Oh, y'know what? If I heard a shot right now, I'd throw my body on you.
That is so sweet. But don't you think it's a little too soon? I mean there's so much we don't know about each other.
Wait, am I missing something though? 'Cause I thought death was something that's supposed to be sad, in a way.
How could you pick up a hitchhiker?! He could be a rape-, a rapist or a killer or something!
What a beautiful night to be running around the street, looking for tickets. And the wind sure made it fun.
You mean the one that my grandmother made me swear on her deathbed that I would never let out of our family?
He's awfully short and I think he's talking to himself. And to be completely honest, he's not that good in bed.
Can you believe this? We were waiting for a hot guy and then an even hotter one shows up!
And y'know, even if they break up again, you'd better not let him in your sad men's club!
Yeah, well he'd prefer water colors, but y'know, he has easy access to a lot of charcoal.
Okay, so umm, somebody has to call Frank and Alice. And then my mom wants to know--Joey, what are you doing?!
Ooh, technically you owe me $600 for sending out happy thoughts on your last ten auditions.
Oh wait! That can't be the one Rachel's talking about. She didn't even know that happened. So which one was it?
Hey you guys, look, the one-eyed jack follows me wherever I go. Right, OK, serious poker.
So great. Oh, we took a nap today and my Mom fell asleep on my tummy and purred.
Ok, look, before you even start, I'm not denying evolution, ok, I'm just saying that it's one of the possibilities.
Oh, I thought this was your party and it turns out it's a party for Howard. He's just the sweetest little man!
Well, come on, who cares what that guy thinks. What does Warren Beatty know about kissing Ooh.
It's okay. Actually y'know what, it's kinda cool. 'Cause it's like y'know, one life ends and another begins.
There you go! Oh, you are so lucky! You might actually get to meet Sting tomorrow! That's why you have kids!
Okay, look you wanna hold onto your food? You gotta scare people off. I learned that living on the street.
Well not clients, lovers. But let's just y'know, try it again. Come back and-and we'll work through it.
Hey! Check it out! This is unbelievable! Joey has been holding his breath for almost four minutes!
"Are you in there little fetus? In nine will you come great us? I will buy you some Adidas."
All I got was a lousy key chain! And by that time I was living in a box. I didn't have keys!
Okay, look at him. Look at those strong hands. Oh what I wouldn't give to be that can of condensed milk.
Huh? Can you just imagine getting down on one knee and handing her this gorgeous piece of weaponry?
Well, sure in a perfect world. But, no, I promised I wouldn't tell, and I swore to like all my gods.
Yes that's right. But still, I-, look at your purse, look at your sweater, look at yourselves.
"Ipan Stripan, Glupi Glabi! " And that is the Swedish National Anthem! Thank you for asking!
Yeah, it's about relationships. Y'know? The traps, the pitfalls, what not to do, keep going. This stuff is great!
That's it! 25 percent? That means that's it's like 75 percent chance of no baby at all!
Well, she's out of town so, there's gotta be something in her house that tells me where my Father is.
Now, that's trash. Young lady, you can't... Hey! Stop that young lady, she donated trash!
Ooh, oh, I've gotta go. Whoa, oh, head rush. One more, and then I have to go. Cool!
Well, he wants to do some ecclectic, so he's looking for someone who can, you know, create the entire menu.
Well, then you should come tonight. You know, just hang out with them. Let them see what a great guy you still are.
Joey, you pick who ever you want. Okay? You just listen to your heart. What does it tell you? Phoebe, Phoebe.
No, no-no, she was a human lady. This is the spirit of my Mom Lily, the one who killed herself.
Yeah. Yeah, I remember trying to steal a cardboard cutout of Evander Holyfield from a Foot Locker.
Oh, well, we have to celebrate. You know what we should do? We should do, like, a soap opera theme.
Uh-hmm. Okay. Well then, could we reschedule? For say, Friday night perhaps at 8 o'clock?
That's right! Oh, yeah... Well, I've totally forgotten about im! AH! That's-That's... a blast from the past!
Um-hmm, that's good to know. But let's stop focusing on what you don't do, and start focusing on what you do do.
Ok, it's very faint, but I can still sense him in the building. Go into the light, Mr. Heckles!
Yes. But I left in the Ys. 'Cause, y'know, "sometimes y". Uh, I also have something else for you.
Hi, um, I just thought that it would be fun if the three of us had some beers and got to know each other.
Oh, this is so intense. One side of my butt is totally asleep, and the other side has no idea.
Yeah, but you've got to pull yourself together! Monica can't see you like this! Then she'll know something's wrong!
It's not a blue screen... it's just, maybe it was just really clear that day. OK, I have to talk to my grandmother.
Well, and you know, it really is a testament to how he was raised. Especially to you. Because he's very respectful of women.
I am so sorry you got caught in the middle of that. I didn't mean to be so out there. I am furious with him!
Well let's just say its she's lucky she has a sweet ass, 'cause she's not so good at the writing.
No, uh-uh, I'm just, I'm nervous. So, you know what, maybe if I just, if I picture them all in their underwear.
Oh wow, three hours and still no baby. Ugh, the miracle of birth sure is a snooze fest.
Yeah, and I know you guys don't know a lot about psychic readings, but that one is pretty much the worse one you can get.
It's mostly just photographs of lesbian love scenes interspersed with video games and free sandwiches.
Uhuh... Yeah...!, you know. And given my life long search for irony, you can imagine how happy I am.
Oh, they see us! Oh, they, they look mad. Oh, they figured it out. They're coming this way. Run!
Or... maybe she has trouble loosening your knots because you're such a high maintenance tight ass!
You wanna be on my list too? Keep talking! Has anyone seem my list by the way?
Oh, okay, umm, hi kids! Um, it's me, Aunt Phoebe. I can't wait to see you. Please don't hurt me!
I'm not gonna give you tips! Look don't you see that this-this...this all came together so that I could stop you from doing this.
I can see that, 'cause they both have those big brown eyes and, ya know, the little pouty chin.
You know, did you ride mopeds? 'Cause I've heard... ... oh, I see... it's not about that right now. OK.
I can't believe two cows made the ultimate sacrifice so you guys could watch TV with your feet up.
I don't know. You could tie her up, she could tie you up; you could eat stuff off each other...
Well, a pipe was my weapon of choice and, uhm, pre-teen comic book nerds were my meat.
But lately all the guys I meet seem really nice at first, then they turn out to be the biggest jerks.
No! No! I'm talking you up to people. Just give it a little time, all right? Relax, get something to eat! Okay?
Um, that's really your decision, I mean, some people prefer, you know, to take off...oh whoops! You're being naked!
Or maybe he-he was writing to tell her that-that he's changed his name, y'know? Tell Monica I'm sorry.
Yeah, okay, listen, umm, Mom, I hope you know you still mean a lot to me. And you're welcome to come back anytime.
But I'm unemployed, my music is all I really have now. Well music, and making my own shoes. Pretty, huh?
Yeah, come on. You know you want it, you know you want it too, come on. Let's just be bad, it'll feel so good.
Well that's no way to sell newspapers. Why don't you try, "Extra! Extra! Read all about it!"
Listen Ross, we ran out of gas, and we don't know where we are, so we can't get a tow truck.
Oh no. No-no-no, don't do that! How could I live with myself if I knew I was depriving the world of your music.
Okay, ah, before you get all talky again, umm, could you also please tell Sergei that I really like his suit.
I don't know, it's just, you know...monkeys, Darwin, you know, it's a, it's a nice story, I just think it's a little too easy.
Oh, look at these! Hey, Ben. Just do it. Oh my God, oh, ok, was that too much pressure for him?
Oh, yeah, sure. I just hope you, hope you don't accidentally suck it up through your nose and choke on it.
Don't try to call him or anything, 'cause he's not there, he's out. His umm, his partner just died.
You mean in case someone is trying to steal your bamboo sleeping mat or your kettle of fish?
'Cause it's good money! But that doesn't change the fact that this is an evil blood sucking corporate machine!
I can't follow Ross! It'd be like those bicycle ridding chimps that followed The Beetles. No.
What? Did you go to a costume party? Let me guess umm Pancho Vila? and you're Bob Saget.
Well y'know every time that they say that like they're doing laundry we'll just give them a bunch of laundry to do.
I'm sorry, okay, I-I wasn't looking, and the store says that they won't take it back because you signed for it...
There you go, that's the spirit! Okay! Now, if you need money, I will lend you money, but just get moving!
Yeah, look I was with my friend downstairs and we hear everything up here that you do, and I am sick and tired... .
Yeah, say my name. Say it! And now I'm going to cover you back up, and umm we're never doing this again.
You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it kinda looks like an old potato.
All right, no, well I want to kill them to, but their boys, y'know how are we gonna beat three boys?
Because I'm normal! That was the one legacy my grandmother left me, and I know you wanted it as an engagement present.
Okay, don't sweat it. Chandler is nowhere around so go ahead get it out of your system. That guy's cute.
Ooh, what happened? Joey all nervous and looking down and fiddling with his ear: Oh.. My sister's raccoon.
I don't know. I don't know. I can't lie to him again. Oh no I-no! I'm just gonna press my breasts up against him.
Isn't it funny how we kept running into each other? It's as if someone really wants us to be together.
Okay. I'd- just- I'd never be able to enjoy it. It would be like this giant karmic debt.
Oh, oh, but y'know, you always see these really beautiful women with these really nothing guys, you could be one of those guys.
No I'm not. No! If anything I'm making you look better! They'll see you talking to me and that's--I'm a hit!
It's not even that. I used to do my songs because it made me happy, but now it's like, it's just all about the money.
Well, Susan, I see what appears to be a dark vent. Wait. Yes, it is in fact a dark vent.
Yeah! And until then you are going to sing to me because the radio's broken and you are selfish but have a nice voice.
You guys kissed!!!!! What does this mean?!! Are you, are you getting back together?! Can I sing at your wedding?
"Good-bye Phoebe and Ursula. I'll miss you. P.S. Your Mom lives in Montauk." You just wrote this!
Yeah, you are, Monica. Remember when I lived with you? You were like, a little, y'know, Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree!
All right. Ok, but, but! You have to promise that you will not be all like control-y and bossy and Monica about it.
As a matter of fact she said that's how I am going to die. So, excuse me for being a little skittish.
Oh my God, he's not even appreciated in his own time. I would give anything to not be appreciated in my own time!
Well, like acoustic folksy stuff. You know? But right now I'm working on a couple 'Iron Maiden' covers.
Ohhh, I wanna come over there and give you a hug and wish you luck on your wedding, but I don't-can't get up.
Fine all right, but I'd bet you'd be singing another tune if we were fighting over a ratchet.
Oh! What's the matter? Are you scared? You're afraid I'm a better singer? You're afraid I'm gonna beat you at singing?
Good for you! And hey, I thought your paper on punctuated equilibrium in the Devonian era was top notch!
Please, right now, no, every time I see him it's like 'Is it on the lose?' 'Is it watching me?'
Now you will not believe this. But, I was in the copy room, making copies, and Ralph Lauren came in.
Umm, sympathy pains. I thought it was really sweet at first, but now I think he's just trying to steal my thunder.
Yeah ok, well at least I didn't let some guy into the forest of my righteous truth on the first date.
I don't know why I was so nervous about this. And I don't know why Frank and Alice are always complaining. This is so easy.
Oh, hi, Mrs. Waltham. I need to speak with ether one of the best men, or Ross's sister Monica.
You guys, um I know that this really doesn't have anything to do with me, but um I love you guys too. Oh, I really needed that.
Uh, well I can tell you why. It's, it's because of me. But, y'know what, I only did it because I love you. Okay?
Well it's just like you're trying too hard. Always making jokes, y'know, you just-You come off a little needy.
It's okay, I mean she had a really incredible life. And it's not like I'm never gonna see her again, y'know she's gonna visit.
Yea. Can I please, please, please talk to one of the best men? This is going to be the last time I promise.
Come on, you guys, you have nothing to lose, I have everything to lose. Do you want me to lose everything? Everything?!
Excuse me, excuse me! Yeah, noisy boys! Is it something that you would like to share with the entire group?
Oh my God! No! Shoo! Kitty! No! No-no-no! Shoo! Come on, you! Come on. Crazy. Oh my God.
There was a pregnancy test in the garbage, and it's positive. Monica's pregnant. So I guess she won't be totally alone.
You got it! Ok. But not on the wine that you made, ok, because I just don't want to go back to the Emergency Room.
Oh my God! I had the best time with Tim last night. He is so sweet! Oh, I can't wait to get sous-neath him.
Does it matter? You're ultimately just gonna die or get divorced or have to blow your pets head off.
I'm really glad you guys are okay but, I just keep thinking what would happen if-if you two actually had hooked up.
You bought your sheets at a flea market? Ross come on, you gotta loosen the purse strings a little.
Oh, I know. I could only think of two names, him and Ed Begley Jr. and then I remembered he's gay.
Oh my god. This is huge. This is bigger than huge. This is like, all right, what's bigger than huge?
But look Chandler, right now, no one has a lower opinion of you than I do. But I totally believe you can do this.
Oh... No, I did that for someone once and I'm not comfortable having that kind of power and control over someone's life.
Really?! I looked into that. Yeah, but, I mean it costs like $60,000 and y'know you can die. And, you would die!
Okay. Would you rather live in the shirt pocket of a sweaty giant, or inside his shower drain?
'Cause he was creepy, and mean, and a little frightening... alright, still, it's nice to have a date on Valentine's Day!
Ok, I just wanna be really sure this time. Andie McDowell's the girl from Four Weddings and a Funeral, right?
Well, it's this guy I used to massage. And by massage, I mean hold down so he wouldn't turn over and flash me.
Oh! David, get one for us too! Oh, oh, and see if they have a heart-shaped one! And with mirrors on the ceiling!
Okay, well y'know what, don't worry you guys, 'cause I'm-I'm gonna do this as many times as it takes to get it right.
And you hate fish. Oh. That's so sweet, alright. Ok, alright, you can see. This is me... Oh, I am scary.
My sticky shoes, my sticky-sticky shoes, why do you stick on me, ba-a-by! Thanks for the lights honey.
Are you kidding? I'm like the one who talked him into it. I like to think of myself as the puppet master of the group.
Hey Rach, wanna hear the new song I'm thinkin' of singing this afternoon? I wrote it this morning in the shower.
Oh, I would love to have kids. . . you're, you're the, you're, me play the songs that I will write for them.
Wait-wait-wait-wait! So, explain something to me though, if, if nobody tagged Rachel, then isn't the play still going.
Ok, ok, you start preparing the formula and I start changing the box and then we gotta put them straight to bed.
Or, or, y'know, um, 'I think we should see other people' means 'Ha, ha, I already am'.
Aren't you gonna answer her, that's like the tenth bing-bong message she sent. She wants to know what's wrong?
Not personal, really, well they said that they never met an Italian actor with a worse Italian accent.
Y'know Monica you had a minor setback in your relationship with Chandler. Big deal! It's only Chandler. I am so sorry.
Ok, question number 28, have you ever allowed a lighning bearer to take your wind? I would have to say no.
Oh no, no, no. I learned never to borrow money from friends. No, that's why Richard Dreyfuss and I don't speak anymore.
Well I want to get in on this. Hey Mon? I don't think I can help you after all, I didn't realize this game was on.
Don't you see? Everyone's looking at me! The plan's working! I didn't even have to take off my top yet!
You're right, that was wrong. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. It's just that I liked you so much. Can we just, can we just start over?
David the scientist guy, David that I was in love with, David who went to Russia and broke my heart David!
Umm listen, I don't think...I don't think I'm gonna make it to the wedding. So I just want to wish you all the luck in the world.
I'll have to get back to you on that. Okay, bye! Oh my God! He wants me to come over and feel his bicep and more!
That's okay. All right, I'm gonna play song that's really, really sad. It's called Magician Box Mix Up.
It's a trip for two! Excuse me. Excuse me, is the person who won the Paris trip at this table?
Ok, you can do this. It's just like pulling off a Band-aid. Just do it really fast, and then the wound is exposed.
No. No! Yes! Ahh. Oh, would you look at that Monica? I just knocked off all of your top scores, how sad.
Yeah. Candy's the mother, Cookie's the daughter. The father's also Cookie. Why am I friends with these people?
Just pretend they're not even here! It's OK Monica, when that spotlight hits you it so bright you won't see anyoneanyway.
Umm, the street. Come on, let's go to the street. Ooh, listen, don't go onto the balcony until after I get back.
All right. Now some of you are gonna get cut, and some of you aren't. But I promise none of you are gonna feel a thing.
I know it's kind of weird, but I mean, she was a big part of my life there, you know, and now I just feel kind of alone.
Bye. Wow. So, that's great. You, Bill, Ross, and Emma are going to be so happy together. What were you thinking?
Well, yeah. Y'know, we were best friends, ever since we were little, our Moms worked on the barge together.
Yeah, but they didn't ask me! Y'know? This way I'm just y'know, the exotic, generous stranger. That's always fun to be.
Oh hey you guys, I couldn't get a reservation for the night of my birthday, so we have to do dinner Thursday night instead.
Yes, I...I am with child. And I didn't want to say anything because it's your day; I didn't want to steal your thunder.
So go fix it! Go find Chandler! He's probably up in your room! Tell him that you're sorry and that you love him.
Okay. Good-bye, little monkey guy. Alright, I wrote you this poem. Okay, but don't eat it 'till you get on the plane.
Oh, hey, hey Nick the boxer let's see what you got. All right ya, put 'em up. Come on.
No, we can go together! Just don't wait too long though, okay? 'Cause I'm outta here sometime before Friday.
Hey, you guys. Listen, I'm sorry that I was hogging the game before--Oh my God! Your friends have some unfortunate initials!
No, as soon as something opens up we'll move right in. Unless it doesn't have a pool, I need a pool.
That's so funny to think if you'd just done that right after the last contest, no one would have had to move at all.
Personal shopping? What is that? Like where you walk around with snooty rich people and tell them what to buy?
Roll playing... You could be the warden; she could be the prisoner. You could be the pirate; she could be the wench!
Ooh! That's Good! Wow! But Now If You Were Pregnant, What Would You Name It? Hint Phoebe.
Oh, it's bad. It's really bad. The only thing in there that isn't burned is an ass. Which I do not remember buying!
Plus, it totally ruined my schedule! I...I haven't done any of the things I wanted to do by the time I was 31!
Well, Vince is great, y'know `cause, he's like a guy, guy. Y'know? He's so burly, he's sooo very burly.
Yeah but, Mischa is so interested in you, that Sergei and I haven't been able to say two words to each other.
Found the vest! I mean we're gonna have to keep an eye on it, y'know make sure we don't lose it again...
Now OK, I haven't seen it yet so, if you don't like it, well, so what, none of you ever made a video. OK.
Well umm, okay we were in the market and she bent down to get some yogurt and she just never came back up again.
No, you can't go there! You know how I feel about these "big massage places"! They're putting people like me out of business!
So! Umm, anyway I-I lived in New York, someone wildly I guess, for umm-Well since I was fourteen.
It was an accident, and, and the woman who did this would never ever hurt a dog on purpose. She's a vegetarian.
I can't believe that! Now the only thing left of my grandmother's legacy is this crumb. I wish you a long and happy marriage.
Okay, first of all, breathe. Second of all, I don't get it. Aren't you the one that decided that you didn't want to be with Ross?
Shh. In a minute, I'm gonna create a diversion. When I do, walk quickly to the door and don't look back.
No-no-no, I know, but you and I are different people though, and this is a totally different situation, and I know that I am not gonna regret this.
Wait a minute. Dr. Drake Ramoray and I work at the same hospital. Wouldn't I come over to say hi to him?
Yeah, just, okay, look I'm going. Um, come on. Op, op, behind the pillar, which way am I gonna go?
Of course I do! And I'm gonna give it back to you as soon as they're done with it at the key shining place.
Five minutes ago, a line like that would've floored me. Now nothing. Well, not nothing, I am still a woman.
Why don't you hire him as an actor? You could have him dress up and put on little skits. Whatever you want.
But I'm a professional! And I'm really good! Look, if you're uncomfortable we can stop. Just give me a chance, okay. Please?
That fan kinda looks like ours. And the birdcage and the...wait a sec! This is our exact living room!
oh I dunno I dunno, you know I mean I like him but am I ready to take my grade a loins off the meat market.
'Hi, I have Phoebe Buffay returning a page. Okay, well, um, she's in her car I'll have to patch you through.'
I know, I know, and I was gonna get it but then he came in with this needle and uh, di-, did you know they do this with needles?
But if-no look, okay. These jerks might not care about you, but the universe does! And that says a lot!
"Whenever I get married, guess who won't get to sing? Somebody named Geller! And somebody else named Bing!"
Ok. Oh good, I'm dating a Russian cab driver. . Seriously does anyone buy this? I smell like beets!
Okay, I wanna be sexy again so I'm trying to catch a cold. It should be easy, supposedly they're pretty common.
Ok, ok, she's taking the trash out so I can get you out of here but it has to be now, she'll be back any minute.
But it's just so unfair that our date has to get cut short just 'cause some guy shot at a store clerk.
.and I said Vicrum you can't just call every time you get lonely you know, you, you gave up that right when you slept with Rachel.
I understand. Yeah. Ok so then ok, so we're both living in New York, not seeing anyone. That's so not like us!
"Hi, it's me, I'm coming over now. Hey, what if I'm already there when your playing this message?" Is that too spooky?
Ok. Do we have to talk like that then they're not around? Oh, no, no! Listen, is there someone who can fill in for me?
Yeah, thanks. And listen, can you do me a favor? Could you just umm, wake me up in a couple hours, y'know if you can.
Oh okay. Umm, all right. Hi, this is Phoebe from Empire Office Supplies, can I speak to your supply manager please?
I don't believe this. Is this how this relationship's gonna work? Ross equals boss. I mean, c'mon what is this, 1922?
More bandages! More bandages! Please, can I get some more bandages in here! This man is dying- Oh no.
No. I'm sorry. It's just 'cause I couldn't be there. 'Cause all I ever get to do now is pregnant stuff, it just bums me out.
Well okay, it's already February and I've only given two massages and they were both the worst tippers in the world!
Monica, I really appreciate you checking in on me, but I'm actually feeling a lot better. Yeah, I just kinda want to be alone right now.
Oh Jim, Jim Nelson I'm Phoebe, Phoebe Buffay. We certainly have been seeing a lot of each other lately.
Ohh, ok, I see what you did there. Aren't you afraid though, that the writers are gonna be kinda mad when they read this?
No! It's a great time, come in...! WOW, hi... Oh my gosh! What are you doing here? Are you back from Minsk?
Uh-huh, let's go. Oh, wait I have gum. Okay. Good, very good, firm but tender. I'd recommend you to a friend.
Oh, yeah. Aw, remember the days when you used to go out to the barn, lift up your shirt, and bend over?
Ah! Well! There you go! Last to know again! And I'm guessing... since nobody told me... this is Paolo.
Oh, David, I, I think you are a sweeping sorta fella. I mean, you're a sweeper! ...trapped inside a physicist's body.
Now if you want to receive e-mails about my upcoming shows, then please give me money so I can buy a computer.
Happy Holidays. Feliz Navidad. Allo, and Merry Christmas. Ohh thank you sir. Here's some joy.
Yeah, my mom used to put her head in the oven. Well, actually, she only did it the one time. But it was pretty weird.
Check it out! Cup hat! Cup banner! Cup chandelier! And the thing that started it all, the cup!
Well, one of you has to take the first step! And it should be you, because she's the one who's leaving. It's harder for her!
No, it's New York magazine. It's an article about the best schools in the city. So how well do you know Sting?
Earl, you're not hearing me! All I'm saying is that you're not alone all right? Everybody hates the people they work with!
You're the cook! With out you it's just me driving up to people's houses with empty trays and asking for money!
Yeah but the Swing Kings? Y'know they suck so much that people actually die at their concerts-They just stop living.
Hey. Guess what! My landlord just called and my apartment is gonna get ready soon, so I guess I'll be moving out.
Nothing! I swear to God I didn't know you guys would be here! And the good news is you didn't believe in soul mates. So...
Oh my God! I killed him! I killed another one! And this curse is getting stronger too, to bring down something that big.
I hate my regular clothes now! Y'know? I look down and-and I know that this isn't gonna be the most special day of my life.
No that's not true. If you're not moving forward, you're just staying still. And staying still is good. Watch this.
Hey you guys! Ok, you're not going to believe this! I just saw my psychic and she said I was definitely gonna win the lottery tonight!
Um, well, get over it. So, I mean you, you just seem to be a really nice guy, you know. Don't be so hard on yourself okay.
Hi! Oh, Alice, hi! Thanks. I'm so glad you could come, 'cause I've got a real umm, Home Ec emergency.
Ah, yeah, he's so adorable, God, he's just so much fun, Joey is the best, I'm glad you're having so much fun here.
Your boobs are fine. Look, I never should have said anything. Come here. Come here. Oh, can't make.... hands... meet....
Ooh! Ooh! And I brought Operation! But, um, I lost the tweezers, so we can't operate. But we can prep the guy!
Okay, whatever. Y'know what? I don't have time have time to convince you because he's only here for four hours, and I'm gonna go see him!
Fine! Okay, all right, so Jane Eyre, first of all, you'd think she's a woman, but she's not. She's a cyborg.
Okay umm, well, first Chandler and Monica will get married and be filthy rich by the way. Yeah. But it won't work out.
No, I mean, I mean, when you're at the fifteenth date, y'know, you're already in a very relationshippy place. Y'know, it's... you're committed.
Well the doctor says it takes a couple days, but my body's always been a little faster than Western medicine.
Oh, if that's what you want you then you really should run his head under hot water and bang his head against a table.
Joey, listen. I can't do this, it doesn't make any sense. Yesterday I was a nurse, and today I'm a waitress at a cafe?
Well, our plan is working. Rachel is having a miserable time, and Ross is just stood up somewhere at a restaurant all alone.
When she comes out, you hold her nose, I'll blow in her mouth, and the kid will just right out of her.
I don't know how to say this, but I think when your wife's spirit left her body, it um, kind of stuck around in me.
So umm, now do you have any of Matt Lauer's clothes here? Maybe? Just ones that haven't been cleaned yet?
Yeah? I know! I know! Uh huh? Listen why don't we just um, sit and relax? You know just be with each other. Quietly!
Well, it helps the bee look tough in front of his bee friends. The bee is happy and I am definitely not.
No, I know, this way when I go to the party later Mike will know I am over him cause I'm gonna smell like another guy. Yeah.
Yeah, well I had to learn, I was staying at the Y and some off the young men weren't acting Christian enough.
No. You are the boss of you. Now you march your heinie in there and get that heart tattooed on your hip. GO!!
Oh, this is terrible. Oh, they've made so many changes I can't even feel my grandmother's presence anymore-Ooh! New sconces!
Oh, I know a way that you can decide! All right, I'm going to ask you a series of questions and you answer as quickly as you can.
It's, I mean, it's nothing, I'm fine. It's my friends. They-they have a liking problem with you. In that, um, they don't.
Yeah, but at what cost? Six more months, three meals a day, I'm gonna eat like, y'know millions of cows.
Oh, look-look, Joey's on TV! Isn't that great? My pledge got Joey on TV! Oh that makes me feel-Oh no!
But you-you can't leave me with them! We-we're a team! We're playing a zone! They're gonna triple team me!
Oh, oh, OK, so everyone, pretend like I'm telling you a story, OK. And, and it's really funny. So everyone just laugh, now.
Yeah, I know because you have all the good words. What do I get? I get "it's," "and" oh I'm sorry, I have "A." Forget it.
No not you, Dr. Drake Remoray. You can ask him questions and see what's he like. People tell doctors everything.
Ross, you're being ridiculous! Okay? You are cute and smart and sweet and that is much more important than three stupid divorces!
Oh, come on! I think he's ready to get rid of, what did you call it? The cheap knock-offs and dinosaur junk.
Wait!! Where are you going?! What are you doing?! No!! Wait!! God!! Why am I always pregnant when she does that?!
Ross, it's not that big a deal! So you'll been divorced three times, you'll still have a life, you'll go on dates...
I love you. But I never needed a proposal from you. I just needed to know that we were headed somewhere, you know, that we had a future.
Sure, yeah. I mean, it's Joey. I don't want him to get hurt. Well, I must say, I am on fire! First Chandler, now Joey!
You're just saying that because you're my biggest fan. Joey listen, take good care of that guy, okay? He's a fan. Bye!
Unless! Unless umm, okay I-I would be willing to go to the concert, umm, all the while thinking about the children of course.
Okay, you have 19 questions left. Use them wisely. Come on Joey! You can't win if you don't ask any QUESTIONS!!!
Now... "Who will perform the ceremony! Who will perform the cer--Oh-oh! All right, I'll pound on him in the morning.
No-no, oh, I'm fine with the age thing y'know, until it starts sticking it's tongue down my little brother's throat!
You know what? Maybe once they start dating, and they see what's out there, they'll realise how good they are for each other.
Yes. Yes. Yes. I can't believe it! The baby wants bologna! Maybe he wants me to eat meat? I can't eat meat!
Y'know, birds have a very good sense of direction, and I thought maybe they could help us find where the presents are hidden.
Ok, good! You guys were so scared! There was no way I was gonna dump this... Oh God, no! I think I broke your bowl.
Hey, you guys, listen, this weekend we're all gonna go to Las Vegas to surprise Joey! Including me!! You wanna go?!
Hi, it's Phoebe. Listen someone's gonna have to take my 9:00 with Mr. Rehack, 'cause it's like 9:15 now, and I'm not there.
So you guys, I'm doing all new material tonight. I have twelve new songs about my mother's suicide, and one about a snowman.
Oh, I should go, too. Oh, now... tomorrow do you guys wanna share a cab to the airport or should Mike and I just meet you there.
Hey. What a day. I took her everywhere. The Museum of Modern Art, Rockefeller Center, Statue of Liberty.
Yeah, otherwise, I mean that's, that's, that's just it for us hanging out together. Y'know is that what you want? Can you be civil?
Well no, when I get to the point where... you know... I'm ready to hear cruel mocking jokes about Mike... I'm gonna come to you.
Rachel, it's okay. You don't have to do this. I believe you. All right? Okay, if-if you say that you kissed Melissa, then you kissed Melissa.
You are useless! Freaking out about commitment is the one thing you can do! The one thing! And you can't even do that right! God!
Oh, good, good, you guys are here! Listen, how would like to spend tomorrow taking care of three incredibly cute little puppies?!
Okay, so I totally took care of the babies all by myself! I fed 'em, bathed 'em, and put 'em to bed.
All right, there are no questions in the happy place. Okay, just, the warm breeze, and the moonlight flowing through the trees....
Oh...Who was so stupid and stubborn that she lashed out against her friend's cooking which she actually thinks is pretty great!
Okay pepperoni, pepperoni, pepperoni, okay Ross, I know she's pretty and you love her, but is she stupid?! She forgot my vegetarian!
Yeah, I agree. Ya know, I think fancy parties are only fun if you're fancy on the inside and I'm just not sure we are.
That's fair! Thank you so much. Thanks. Oops, it looks like when he got the pastry chef he got you a little bit too.
Well, I'm not proud of it, but, you know... sometimes when I was living on the street and I needed money for food and stuff I.
But they don't see all the wonderfulness that I see. They don't see all the good stuff and all the sweet stuff. They just think you're a little...
You remember her from my birthday party two years ago. She's yeah, like, average height, medium build, bald...
Yeah, that was Leslie calling again to see if we can get back together. That's the twentieth time today! And good luck Leslie!
Really? There's nothing sexual about this? Oooh. Oo God! Ohh. Ohhhh. Ohh. What are you looking at?! I mean hi.
I can't believe I never realized this before, I'm in my thirty's and never been in a long-term relationship oh my god what's wrong with me.
No! Hey, we're not leaving until we get paid! I don't know who she thinks she is! Enough is enough! Hey, widow?
No, no, because, you know, he's been in Minsk for 8 years and if he gets too much direct sunlight, he'll die.
Y'know what you should send him? A cartoon of cigarettes. 'Cause that why he could trade it for protection. No. That's prison.
I-I mean I, well I think I can figure it out. I guess y'know I was born, and everyone started lying their asses off!
Wow! Oh my God, well if they've ripped off our table ours must be much more than one and fifty dollars!
All in good time my love. All in good time. Oh shoot! I left my guitar in their apartment. Well you can let me in later.
No, you can't let this stop you from getting massages! No look, I have, I have lots of clients that make the same noises you do!
Oh, ok. Fine, I'll just, I'll take the hat back . Rachel: Hey, so you guys, the funniest thing happened, at work...
No! No! It's-it's uh a real thing! Anyone can get ordained on the Internet and perform like weddings and stuff!
Thankfully you don't need me at all so Okay Super aunt see you later! Rachel let's give it six to eight months .
Hey, buddy. How's my favorite dog, huh? How's my favorite dog? You're subdued. Did you give him a beer?
Well, maybe she didn't hear! Ok I'm gonna go into that dressing room, you stay in here and I'll talk and see if you can hear me.
Oh, you're a paleonthologist, too! Oh, ok, now, what do you think of Ranion's new theory of species' variegation in segmented arthopods?
Well, you kind of just did. That guy is going to call you tonight. Ross is going to pick up the phone and that's a pretty clear message.
Okay, I can't believe that Monica and Chandler are getting married. I remember talking about this day with Rachel while we were showering together, naked.
Alright, so, can we turn this off? Can we just make it... make them go away? Because I cant, I cant watch.
Ohh! Okay! Okay, cause when-when he said, "I can't wait to hear your first words," I thought, "There's a trick."
Please, don't play the music. Just uh one more. LIVE FROM NEW YORK! IT'S SATURDAY NIGHT!!
I remember the day I got my first pay check. There was a cave in in one of the mines, and eight people were killed.
I'm not gonna lie to you, Ross, it doesn't look good. I put a clip on one side, which seems to have stopped the curling.
Y'know you, you just stop being such a wuss and get those off and you come with us and watch naked girls dance around!!
Yeah... ooh... wow... Even started to think I'd never meet someone that, you know, I wanted to... do this with. Here you go.
Oh, OK, so then what is it? Some kind of... you know, like, like... some kind of, y'know, like... alright, what is it?
That's it?! You call that a fight? Come on! "We were on a break!" "No we weren't!" What happened to you two?!
I know but he call's and my heart goes to him. You know that bastard is one smooth talking free lance kite designer.
Yeah. I guess she hasn't seen everything yet. I'll be right back, she has to go to the bathroom again. Oh, such a pretty face.
Oh alright, stop, STOP THE MADNESS. This is crazy. Who can even remember why this even started in the first place?
Yeah, but, ah, ah, nothing has to happen. We're just having fun. You know, not everything had to go as far as "eye-contact."
Rachel, didn't have anything that I liked, so, but she had this Christmas ribbon, and I thought, 'All right, fine I'll be political.'
Okay I've got one for you, if you had too which one would you rather eat, a seeing eye dog or a talking gorilla?
Yeah, no, Ralph doesn't look anything like that guy. He's-he's young and he's got long hair and a beard and a hacky sack.
Well, c'mon, if it's important enough to discuss while I'm playing, then I assume it's important enough for everyone else to hear!
Well, so, umm, anyway umm, I've been, I've been looking for my Father, and umm, have you heard from him, or seen him?
Oh, well, it doesn't have a name-oh, okay, Phoebeball! No, it doesn't have a name. Umm, okay, Monica, what is your favourite thing about trees?
Wow! Five-month maternity leave, you're back for four days, kiss a co-worker, call in sick, they are lucky to have you!!
Oh okay. How about the whole "man walking on the moon" thing. You know? You. you could. You could see the strings people!
Yeah. Except for, y'know when you're on a date and you're getting along really great but the guy's translator keeps getting in the way.
Well, I-I thought a lot about what you said, and um, I realilized duh, all right maybe I was a little judgmental. Yeah, oh, but oh...
He says, that he would cremate my fur coat for free if I umm, y'know, bring in the next person I know who dies.
Rachel is one of my closest friends. Although, being the only one who knows anything about this does makes me feel special. Okay!
I-I wanted to apologise if I-y'know seemed a tad edgy yesterday at my shower. Y'know it's just the hormones, y'know.
Yeah, I know, he's sweet, but it's just not fun anymore, you know? I don't know if it's me, or his hunger strike, or, I don't know.
"We thought Phoebe would leave, but she just stayed and stayed. That's right, I'm here all night, and Chandler will never get l..."
Well, nobody wants a ghost. But you've got one, because the house is sitting on an ancient Indian burial ground.
Wow! This reminds me of the time when I was umm, living on the street and this guy offered to buy me food if I slept with him.
Um, um. It's huge. Yeah, that's the moment, when-when, you know she stopped being a princess, and became, like, a woman, you know.
Well-But-Now, if-if you can achieve positronic distillation of sub-atomic particles y'know before he does, then he can come back.
Ohh, they're having a great time with their Aunt Phoebe! Aunt Rachel hasn't been helpful at all. So, do you miss me?
That's not why you're going! You're going because you hope he's gonna say, "Yeah, I love you too, Rach. Forget that British chippy."
Well alright, looks like you guys have got it under control so I'm just gonna go. No! Really? Misery really does love company. All right!
Oh no, no, no, no... That's okay, that's okay... I mean, I'm... I am a vegetarian... except for veal... Yeah no, veal I love...
Ooh, so this is great! Rachel's gonna have a terrible date, Ross gets stood up, and then they'll realise how good they have it together.
Monica- Hi! Um, Monica, you're scaring me. I mean, you're like, you're like all chaotic and twirly. And not-not in a good way.
No, okay, you're right. You're easy-going. You're just not as easy-going as Rachel. She's just more flexible and-and mellow. That's all.
No, I know, I know, that this is Frank's life, y'know. Y'know, I don't want to be all judgmental, y'know, but this is sick, it's sick and wrong!
What are you doing?!! Why are you defending him?! Just get me another doctor! One who is not crazy and who is not Fonzie!
All right, fine, fine, but if you're my next victim, don't come back as a poltergeist and like suck me into the TV set.
Oh my God! Well the idea of a woman flirting with a-with a single man, we-we must alert the church elders!
...My mother's ashes Even her eyelashes Are resting in a little yellow jar, And sometimes when it's breezy...
And a crusty old man said I'll do what I can and the rest of the rats played moroccas. That's it, thanks, good night.
All better! Back to work! Except this clown from research told me I was fired. He should do his research, huh?
Alright, nothing is worth this. Uhm, I have a confession to make... uhm, okay, you know, that girl that mugged you when you were a kid.
Come on, you saw the way he ran out of here! What do you think? He's gonna stick around and talk to the daughter he abandoned!
...and I-I can't take it! Y'know? I'm just, always afraid one of them is gonna catch me with the other one. It's making me crazy.
Monica and Chandler said that you were having so much fun here. And apparently no amount of drums or tarantulas is gonna change that.
Well, it's a long story. It's kind of embarrassing. Let's just say there was a typographical error with a sex manual. How about you?
Umm, Wethering Heights. I'm taking a literature class at the New School and I have to finish it for the first session tomorrow.
I'm on top of the world, looking down on creation and the only explanation I can find, is the wonders I've found ever since...
No. No. It's just I was umm, I was with Ross and Jill after you left and umm, I'm pretty sure I saw a little spark between them.
Are you kidding. He is so considerate of my feelings and... you know I think... you'd also like to know that he is a very gentle lover.
Okay, now would you say that that's more than 50 yards away from Sting, his wife, or a member of his family?
All right. I'm gonna go to the fertility doctor and um, see if I'm ready to have Frank and Alice's embryo transferred into my uterus.
Well, on the bright side, now you won't have to see all these paleontologists with their shirts off. Not you guys. You got it going on!
But that woman can't know I work here. She's a friend of mine and I made this big stink about how awful this massage chains are.
Look, I feel really bad about how I freaked you out before, so I called the father and asked him to meet you here so you can tell him. Go!
No, I know! I-I'm sorry, but the moment I touch him, I just wanna throw out my old oath and take a new, dirty one.
Okay, well if I was in this for the money, I'd be a millionaire by now, y'know. You just got to get out of that jingle head sweetie.
Okay, I would ring the bell to distract him and then I would knock the gun out of his hand with a Chinese throwing star.
Right. My name was on there, but now it just says "carrot cake". So, um, so um, how many chords do you know?
Oh, wait, she's walking across the floor.. she's walking.. she's walking.. she's going for the pizza- Hey, that's not for you, bitch!
I-I'm sorry it wasn't one of those movies with, like, y'know, guns and bombs and, like, buses going really fast...
No. It's all right; it's probably false labour. They said that, that can happen near the end, just somebody get the book.
Yeah. Oh, I know what we can do. We could set Ross and Rachel up on horrible dates, so that they'll realise how good they are together.
Okay. We are at a rest stop on Route 27. Okay. There is no Route 27. Okay, either 93 or 76?
I'm, uhh, making up flyers trying to get new massage clients. So, can I come to Bloomingdale's and use the copy machine.
Oh my God! So was she! And! Get this, okay? Your-your name is Earl, right? Her name was Pearl, P-Earl.
Because she exchanges every gift she ever gets, it's like impossible to get her something she likes. Come on, let's trade!
Hey Joey, I just wanted to let you know that I found a selfless good deed. I just went down to the park and I let a bee sting me.
Shh! Doogie, shh! Doesn't anybody understand that I'm gonna be having babies soon? Huh? Go! Go little boy, go!
Will he know what this is in reference to? And he has your number? All right, I'll see that he gets the message. Bye bye.
Sure! Look, ok, bottom line: I love Mike... David! David. I love David. Don't look at me that way, Roseanne Rosannadanna!
Let's go! Come on! Move it! Come on! Shoes! Briefcase! Thanks Lou, good luck with the gall bladder.
And did you notice the ice? Look! We have it all! We have crushed! Cubed! And dry! Watch! Ahhh! Mystical!
No Chandler, they can swallow one of those little parts! And also, look at his smooth area, that's just gonna mess them up.
Hurry! Monica's gonna make you pack! She's got jobs for everyone! Now, it's too late for me, but save your selves!
Look kibbles, bits. Oh God, alright, get the hell off my leg you yippity piece of crap. Ok, alright, we have a problem.
Yeah and yeah, and it would probably be better than the last telephone job I had. Y'know, I probably wouldn't have to say spank as much.
By the time anyone's figured out what we've done, we'll be in sunny Mexico. Oh, wait, that's the end of a different plan.
Well, Ross does. What... You're - you're ruining the plan! Joey, you've - you've fixed him up with his perfect woman!
Okay, come on Rach it's present time! Y'know you're the glue that's holding this whole party together. It's kinda falling apart here.
Oh no, I am mad at you. I know that much. But, I am sorry about the fat ass thing. You actually have a very sweet little hiney.
You are unbelievable! I spent so much time finding the perfect girl for you, you know. Mary Ellen is really smart and cute and loose.
OK. Smelly cat, smell-ly cat, what are they feeding you? Smelly cat Oh woah, oh my God. I mean like, who was that?
Yeah, but Monica, do you actually want to be in a relationship where you can actually use the phrase, "That's not how your dad used to do it."
Wait a minute, no, this is, this is the reason you brought me. Okay? I know how to haggle. So let me handle this from here on out.
Yeah, but this isn't the face of a person who trusts a person. Ok, this is the face of a person who, you know, doesn't trust a person.
: Yeah, um... You know you, you should just forget about what I said under the bridge, I was talkin' crazy that night, I was so drunk!
Talk about crap. Try listening to Stella Niedman tell the story of her and Rod Steiger for the hundredth time.
Happy Chanukah, Monica! May your Christmas be snowy, Joey! Happy New Year, Chandler and Ross. Spin the draddle, Rachel!
Uhh, I can't stop thinking about it. It's just so hard. I just wanna grab all these houses and rub 'em all over my body.
Nobody! Nobody respects the bucket! You wouldn't believe what people put in here! Look! Okay, does this look like a garbage can to you?
Oh...Joey, you bummed him out! This was the happiest dog in the world, and he spends half a day with you, and look at him!
Most people don't like their jobs, I love my job! I have not been working for three hours and I'm already going crazy. I miss Joan.
Oh, yeah! You like 'em? I just, I went to a used clothes store and got a bunch of maternity stuff. These are sooo comfortable!
Y'know, if you want, you can call her machine, and if she has a lot of beeps, that means she probably didn't get her messages yet.
Well, it's not okay, because I gave a very memorable performance as the nurse. And now suddenly I'm the waitress? That's gonna confuse my fans.
My mom's gonna be here any minute. I can't do this, I can't give him up. Yes-no, I can. I don't want to. But I can. No.
I have a date with this diplomat I met while I was giving free massages outside the UN and, I don't know where his country is.
That is correct! Yes, you're supposed to take all of that stuff and put it in a little box in your mind and then lock it up tight.
Well, we don't n-n-n-n-need a fireman, we'd, we'd like a good mechanic. Oh my God, here they come! Well, we gotta get out of here!
No I'm not okay. The only guy I've ever been crazy about has gone to Minsk and I may never...I may never see him again.
Yeah! Y'know, we were really huge too, but then they had to shut us down when Regina Philange died of alcohol poisoning.
Oh, Greg and Jenny yuck! Hi Greg, I'm Chandler this is Monica. Hi Monica, this is Jenny. Hi Jenny. Hi Greg.
Well... but David, just... I just want you to know that... that... you know... telling you this... is one of the hardest things I've ever had to do.
Yes! I do! All the time! I love them! Oh my God! I did it! It's me! It's me! I burned down the house! I burned down the house!
They found their bodies the very next day, they found their bodies the very next... la la la la la la.
Oh my god. Now I've seen everything! Whoa, she's gone. She's gone. She's gone! Go ahead, get married. Go, go.
Honey, I wish you would get over her. I hate seeing you like this. Is there anything I can do for you? Do you want to look down my top?
Yeah! And look, see how they expand as the baby grows? And then after the baby's born, they're great for shoplifting melons.
Ugh, okay, I have an enormous crush on you. But because you're a client, I can't ask you out, even though you give me y'know, the feeling.
Alright, okay, so we can all go now. That is fun. Hey, you know what? We all haven't been together the six of us in such a long time.
Fine! I'll do it without you! I don't need you or anybody else! I'm gonna make it on my own! You'll see!! You'll all see!!
Yeah, umm that's Whitney , Kyle's ex-wife out there, now do you think that you can y'know divert her so that we can slip out?
Hi! Oh, yeah, no, I know. You're a chef. I know, and I thought of you first, but um, Chandler's the one who needs a job right now, so....
'Cause my, my grandmother's never had chicken pox. Please, please tell me you have, 'cause oh my God, I forgot how cute you are.
Y'know it doesn't matter how much I'm craving it. Y'know why I'm never gonna eat meat? Because it's murder, cold blooded murder.
Mmmmmm! Everything smells so delicious! You know, I can't remember a time I smelt such a delicious combination of of, OK, smells.
Well, y'know I may have relatives in France who would know. My grandmother said she got the recipe from her grandmother, Nesele Tolouse.
But I don't think I can! it was ok to move in when I didn't know what was gonna happen, but I can't move in knowing that nothing is ever gonna happen.
Well, I mean, I'm not married married, ya know, he's just a friend and he's gay and he's just from Canada and he just needed a green card.
That-It's not the same thing! This is totally different! This is with David! Remember David, the scientist guy? Okay, he's very special to me.
Uh huh, what is happening to the world? I mean, no no no, 'cause ET leaves, and and Rocky loses, Charlotte dies.
But no, because a doctor won't be able to help him, it's just gonna y'know naturally pass through his system in like seven years.
I'm just saying that only a man completely secure with his masculinity could walk around in women's underwear! I don't think you could ever do that.
Oh no! Wait! Wait! Okay, y'know what, you were right, you were right. We really weren't great at being guys, but you know why? Because we're girls.
Yeah. That's what you really want. Yeah, I don't want to be the reason you're unhappy, that would just make me unhappy, and I really don't want to be the reason I'm unhappy.
Alright, I'm sorry but these people needed me. They work hard all week, it's Saturday night, they deserve to have a little fun. Go.
That's like the pervert motto! Yeah! Yeah! They have you raise your right hand, put your left hand down your pants, and repeat that!
Cups and ice? Ooh, I get to be in charge of cups and ice? All right. Fine, okay, I will be in charge of cups and ice!
Oh my God! I'm going out with Eric! Ooh, this day is really gonna be so much better than I thought it was gonna be. Oh Ross, I can't make lunch.
The Licorice Room, you can eat all the furniture. And, when guests come over, they can stay on the tootsie roll-away bed.
My massage client, Arthur? His daughter called and said that some guy that worked for me gave him a really weird massage this afternoon.
Ok, ok, ok. Ooh, hey 'new doc on the block, Days of Our Lives' Joey Tribbiani.' Ooh, cool picture.
Well, alright, we already tried feeding her, changing her, burping her, oh try this one! Go back in time and listen to Phoebe!
No look, we've apologized twice! I can't do anymore than that. I know you hate it when people are mad at you but you just have to be okay with it.
Ooh! I know what you could make! I know! Oh, you should definitely make that thing... you know, with the stuff? You know, that thing... with the stuff...? OK, I don't know.
Oh well, okay, hey, y'know how when you're umm, you're walking down the street and you see three people in a row, and you say, "Oh, that's nice?"
Ok, I talked to the vet, people are so nice upstate. Anyway, he said that the little fella's gonna be ok and I can pick him up tomorrow.
Well my guy is spectacular. Okay? He's a massage client and one time umm, when he was on the table, I looked at it. And I mean all of it.
Or, y'know, I used to beg for money. Of course it helps if you've got y'know a little of this goin' on. Wow! I still have it!
Right, oh yeah. Wow, oh, it looks like Ross is breaking up with her. Uff, I hope he lets her down easy. Let's go.
Come on you know what to do! You hire the first one! You don't hire an assistant because they're cute, you hire them because they're qualified.
Like okay I-I-I, I haven't met any Portuguese people! I, I haven't had the perfect kiss! And I haven't been to sniper's school!
Oh no, it is forbidden! No-no, Mrs. Potter fires people for fooling around with clients. And it's against my oath as a masseuse.
Ugh! I don't know Monica. It feels funny just being here. I mean if you buy a bed from Janice's ex-husband, that's like betraying Chandler.
Ok, this is a typical lightning-bearer thing. Right there, it's like, um, 'Hello, who wants one of my fallic shaped man cakes?'
I don't know, I mean, he's a good person, and he can be really sweet, and in some ways I think he is so right for me, it's just... I hate that guy!
Well, they said that I had to think about it first, but what is there to think about? I'm gonna be giving them the greatest gift you can possibly give.
So, I need to write some depressing stuff to go along with my new floozy voice, but nothing that sad has ever really happened to me.
And how none of it matters when the people really love each other. And how people will believe anything you tell them as long as it's a compliment.
Gauze! Gauze! I need to get some gauze in here! Can I please get some gauze in here! Whew! This is getting ridiculous uh!
Y'know I had a dream where Ross and Rachel were still together, they never broke up. And we were all just like hanging out, and everyone was happy....
They give you away! There's just-there's just too much wisdom in there. Just put some tea bags on there for like 15 minutes.
Really?! Oh that's so exciting! Thank you! Thanks Mon! Oh but Mon, if you touch my guitar again I'll have to pound on you for a little bit.
Yeah, she turned you into this-this-this untrusting, crazy, jealous, sycophant. All right, so I don't know what sycophant means, but the rest is right.
I guess so, can I. can I think it's cool that you kiss me and also wanna kiss you again and umm, be a little concerned about the magic markers.
Eh, Monica it, it feels so weird, y'know, Chandler's your friend... Oh! Oh my God! Aw, all right take this bed, you can make other friends.
But, but this is my gig. This is where I play. My, my name is written out there in chalk. You know, you can't just erase chalk.
What are you guys talking about, I loved it! It was soo moving. Oh, plus it's just, it's so different from the stuff you usually hear.
Oooh! I have something you can do! I have this new massage client... Steve? Anyway, he's opening up a restaurant and he's looking for a head chef.
No!! No way! No! And stop using my name! And shame on you! And shame on all of you! You're disgusting! Especially you with that!
Ok, well, alright, who thinks the food is fine, the music was fine, but your evening was ruined by this incessant poll taking? .
God, they thought they can mess with us! They're trying to mess with us?! They don't know that we know they know we know! Joey, you can't say anything!
Ohh! All right! All right. Here's what we'll do, I'll get twice as drunk as Monica and then no one's will even notice her.
Okay. Hey, can you send somebody up and down 76 and check every rest stop, and, and also 93? Okay! Yeah, no they don't do that.
Oh, my first massage today is this incredibly gorgeous guy, and every time I see him I just want to do things to him that I'm not allowed to charge for.
Well, I'm watching it for some friends who went out of town. Wait. Hello, my name is Clunkers. May I please stay with you nice people?
Hey you guys! Chandler's coming and he says he has, like, this incredible news, so when he gets here, we could all act like, you know...
Ok, this is not about the MONEY, ok? It's about... it's about corporate greed destroying our hearts and leaving us... the hollow shells.
Like she's really mean, and she's over critical, and-and-No! She will paint a room a really bright color without even checking with you!
Ok, all right. We want to hear everything. Monica, get the wine and unplug the phone. Rachel, does this end well or do we need to get tissues?
Coo, again. Don't blame the pretty lady. It was not her fault. It was me, the pigeon, coo! Seriously, stop staring at her.
Well, I think my mother was too busy planning her suicide to provide saltwater treats. Thank you! So what, you're just never going to tell her?
Oh, this is so nice. Alright I have to make a speech. I just wanna say that of all the guys that Monica has been with, and that is a lot, I like you the best.
Oh Joey, we've heard the specials three times! Okay? There's prime rib, mahi mahi, and a very special lobster ravioli.
Hey!! The charity's on fire! Help! Oh good! Thank you, I need that. Whoa! What is that?! It's nine o'clock in the morning!
Look, I, y'know, I don't mind taking it slow, I like him a lot, y'know he's really interesting and he's really sweet and why won't he give it up?
Okay. Then he still has this huge decision to make. Now he's walking around thinking, 'Do I want to be a dad?' and then bam!
Hi! Oh yeah, uh-huh, it's me. I saw you grab your running shoes this morning and sneak out. You lied so you could run by yourself.
Yeah. Ok, you don't have to believe me but um, can you think of any unfinished business she might have had, like any reason she'd be hanging around?
If you hadn't just had a baby with my best friend I swear to Lucifer a raber dog would be feasting on your danglers RIGHT NOW!
Oh God, this is turning into the worst wedding day ever! The bride is pregnant. The groom is missing. And I'm still holding this.
Yeah, yeah, first there was my aunt Mary, and then there was umm, John, my mailman, and then my, my cowboy friend 'Albino Bob'.
Ohh, I'm getting too pregnant for this, lugging around a stupid massage table. Y'know, I have to find a job where I carrying a smaller table.
All right, all right, so up until '92-93 he was very trusting, then '94 hit, Carol left him and bamn! Paranoid city!
Y'know it's funny, you'd think I'd be angry. I mean, you'd think I'd wanna rip his tiny little head off. Fortunately, I'm past it.
No, no, no, no, no... It's not... it's not... i'ts not as bad as it looks... really. I was just saying goodbye to an old friend.
Yeah. Well, we called everyone in your phone book and bunch of people came, but it took us so long to get you here that they-they had to leave.
I, I don't know what to say. I mean, you know, you're married to someone for six years and you think you know him and then one day says, 'Oh, I'm not gay.'
But they shouldn't happen, you know what, you're, you're in a terrible, terrible business. Oh God, I don't wanna be the person who makes your face look like that.
I will find a selfless good deed! 'Cause I just gave birth to three children and I will not let them be raised in a world where Joey is right!
Yeah and oh, and but there's, there's wind and the wind can make us Goddesses. But you know who takes out wind? Men, they just take it.
I'm sorry, for the last time, why aren't you two together again? No, I know. I know, because you're not in that place. Which would be fine, except you totally are.
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. Ugly Naked Guy is decorating his tree. Oh my God, you should see the size of his Christmas Balls.
Um, that's it. No. Hey! You! J. Crew guy. Yeah. Why have you been following me? I mean, all week long everywhere I look there's you.
Yeah, what is that? Like, some kind of guy thing? Like, some kind of sexist guy thing? Like it's poker, so only guys can play?
Well, same thing we did all day, hang out at Gary's apartment. He is so amazing, we never left the bedroom. But have fun at the movie.
I can't ask him! Do you have any idea how inappropriate that would be?! All I'm saying is just talk to Frank. Okay? Just, y'know, feel him out!
Grasp one of the linen strips by its 'easy grab tab' and pull it off in one quick pain free motion.
Let's see. Oh my God! Oh... But no! No! You can't-you can't hire him, because that-it's not professional. Umm, this is for me yes? Thanks.
And they were serving franks which is his first name minus the s at the end. And there was a rotisserie with spinning chicken.
Well, I'm ready to get the hell out of here! Oh. Are you? Are you?!! Ohh! That's so great!! Ooh, not for Bonnie. But for you, yay! Ohh.
Okay but that's why you have to buy it, so it can fulfil it's Christmas destiny, otherwise there gonna throw it into the chipper. Tell him, Joey
Okay, dime! You guys should probably keep talking; this could take a while. Oh no, wait! Look it! Whoa! Oh my God, this is a police badge!
Yeah, I-I can't-I mean y'know I was trying to be really y'know okay and upbeat about it, I just-I feel so dwarfed by your musical gift. I...
It does! How would you feel if you couldn't share your cooking? Or-or imagine how Ross would feel if he couldn't teach us about dragons.
Oh well, as long as it is under control, you know, you can't do anything about it, he's already dating her, and she is a nice person, that wouldn't be right.
I, I don't, I don't understand, how can you be straight? I mean, you're, you're so smart and funny and you throw such great Academy Award parties.
So far, it kinda blows. I don't know, I just thought y'know that he'd feel more like a brother y'know, like you and Ross, just like close and connected and....
Okay, okay. If I were omnipotent for a day, I would want, um, world peace, no more hunger, good things for the rain-forest...And bigger boobs!
What is this obsessive need you have to make everyone agree with you? No, what's that all about? I think, I think maybe it's time you put Ross under the microscope.
I haven't exactly had a normal life and I never really felt I was missing out on anything but it just feels that now it's my turn some of the regular stuff.
Sticky shoes, sticky shoes, always make me smile. Sticky shoes, sticky shoes, next time I'll.... avoid the..... pillleeeee.
All right, I'm gonna close my eyes and point to someone, and you, whoever I point has to come up with something fun for us to do, and we have to do it.
Oh really. Okay. let me ask you something. Yesterday at the coffee house, I went to the bathroom and when I came back, my muffin was gone-who took it?
No, no, it's not that. Uhm... Remember when you asked me if I was seeing someone and I said no? Well, uhm... I am. His ... his name is Mike.
Hey, Frank. Look, okay, I know that you think I did like this totally evil thing, but I so didn't. There's someone here who can explain this better than I can.
Here, now I don't eat chicken, so it's just noodle soup. And there's no chicken in the broth either, so it's really just... noodle water.
Well, it was an accident...You know, it's a lot of oil and sometimes the hand just slips! Chandler: Have I got a surprise for you? Pack your bags!
What if we don't find him somebody else? We'll just tell her the date's off, but we don't tell Ross, and he goes to the restaurant and gets stood up!
Concert. Yeah. That does put us in...quite a pickle. Because you see I'm very busy before and after the concert, and he's obviously busy during.
All right, wait! Just wait. Everybody just calm down. Okay? Let's give our friend Joey a chance to explain why he's such a big pervert!
Oh, it's my fault?! You didn't have to massage him! You could've sent him away! You could've not rolled Tonka trucks up and down his back!
I like this lily. It's more open, ya know, and that's like my mom. She had a more open, giving spirit. Ooh, Foghorn Leghorn, ooh.
Oh absolutely yeah! Oh and keep in mind, now, I was carrying triplets so in, y'know, medical terms I was-I was thrice as randy.
Well, I said, I told him y'know, that I was the executor person of Francis' will and that I needed to talk to him so I'm gonna meet him at the coffee house later.
Oh Ross no. Be careful, that is very old! Okay? Early Colonial bird merchants used to bring their birds to market in that.
Yeah. Okay. Umm, y'know, my friends are having a Halloween party tonight at my old apartment so, you could come. Maybe I could meet the guy you're marrying.
Yeah! Or too, you could be two stockbrokers and you're-you're-you're rolling around naked on the trading floor and everybody's watching! It never happened.
Oh! And, he's the kinda guy who, when you're talking, he's listening, y'know, and not saying 'Yeah, I understand' but really wondering what you look like naked.
You guys, what, what do we do about Ross who drove all the way up here? What do we do? Just like send him back and we're then gonna go skiing?
Aw, honey it's not your fault, y'know this is who you are, and I love you, and I want us to be friends, and if I keep living here I don't see that happening.
No! It's my first birthday with a boyfriend, and he has to work. Uch, I get mad at him, but I think it's a little to soon to show my true colors.
All right y'know what, nevermind! Everyone wants to have a green one! I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to get so emotional, I guess it's just the holidays, it's hard.
I had to bring them! We killed their mother, they're our responsibility now. You know, they require constant care. You should know that, Rachel, you're a mother.
Nuh-uh! They're maternity pants. They even came with a list of baby names. See, these names are good, and these names are bad. Ohh.
Oh, no-no, this place is totally healthy! That-this milk is mine. I bought this today, 'cause I was thirsty for milk, y'know. Okay, let's go!
Yeah, I'm gonna go back to being Street Phoebe. Yeah! Oh but, y'know what? I can't go totally back because Street Phoebe really wouldn't be friends with you guys. Sorry.
Quite an interesting turn of events, suddenly it's my book to the rescue, huh? Ooh, very interesting. Yeah, well this certainly clears things up.
And! Y'know what Jake says? That women's underwear is actually more comfortable. And he loves the way the silk feels against his skin.
Mike knows I'm coming, and if I don't show up he'll think it's because of him! And I don't want to lose face! That's a very serious thing in my culture.
Oh hey Mon? Rach is here! Ohh, you're still pregnant. Oh, I'm sorry. I know how uncomfortable you are. Y'know what? You look great. Yeah, like fifty bucks.
Oh yes. Oh and, the part about how they're always like drinking from out pool of inner power, but God forbid we should take a sip.
Come on! The boss that fires a guy that's just been dumped, bitch! And the woman who dumps a guy that's just been fired, blond bitch!
I-I can't find anything that I want to eat! Everything I eat makes me nauseous! I'm telling you, being pregnant is no piece of cake-ooh! Cake! No.
Oh, okay, I'm having another one! This one doesn't hurt either-Ooh, yes it does! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ooh! Oh, I was kinda hoping that was it.
Oh my God! May I just say that you two gentlemen have the exact same hands! They're identical! Now, I've never seen anything like that in the business world.
Oh my God! You're right! Go! Go tell Chandler! Hurry before it's too late! Wait no! Does this also mean putting out doesn't get you love?
Okay, well I'll bring them by tomorrow morning. Okay, and uh, by the way, they're not actually puppies, they're Frank and Alice's triplets. Okay, see ya!
No, you are not, you are very attractive. You know what, I go through the exact same thing. Every time I put on a little weight, I start questioning everyting.
Okay Rachel, I can't wait to live with you! And you know what we should do? Bring Monica and then we could all live there together! We'll have so much fun!!
I, I don't wanna meet my father over the phone. What am I gonna say, like 'Hi, I'm Phoebe, the daughter you abandoned. Oh, by the way, I broke your dog.'
Gosh, what's the pay like? Oh, come on people... come on, now, if I don't know who makes the most, how do I know who I like the most! Hey Joey!
Well, because we thought you knew!! It's so obvious! God, that would be like telling Monica, "Hey, you like things clean." Or, y'know, "Hey, Joey, you're gay."
Wait! This seat is really uncomfortable! Yeah, maybe before we start we should just get another one. Perhaps, like an airplane seat-or a beanbag chair!
I just wish there was something we could do. Hello. Hello, Coma Guy. GET UP, YOU GIRL SCOUT! UP! UP! UP!
I want to, but I just want you to tell me that marriage isn't really that big a deal. You know that I won't, I won't be missing out on anything. That marriage stinks!
Alright, so, what, he's not a famous tree surgeon? And then, I guess, OK, he doesn't live in a hut in Burma where there's no phones?
Relax every muscle in your body. Listen to the plinky-plunky music. Okay, now close you eyes, and think of a happy place. Okay, tell me your happy place.
From the nursery rhyme. 'There was a crooked man, Who had a crooked smile, Who lived in a shoe, For a... while...'
I'll find Bob, I'll get him. Bob? Bob! Robert! Oh wait, I think I hear him. Oh - Oh my god! Bob had babies! Bob's a mom!
Okay, I'm gonna go too. I'm gonna go to the airport. I figure if I hang around there long enough, someone's bound to leave one of those planes unattended.
Oh! You know my friend Abby who shaves her head? She said that if you want to break the bad boyfriend cycle, you can do like a cleansing ritual.
No, uhm... David and I did use to go out... but years ago, and he lives in Minsk. He's only... he's only in town for a couple of days.
Well maybe you don't talk about your feelings back then. Maybe you just say something about y'know all the things that he's taught you. Like... Or all the things you taught him.
Thanks. Hi, um, 'kay. I'd like to start with a song that's about a man that I recently met, who's, um, come to be very important to me. 'Kay.
Ok, well that's bad. But don't you think it might be different with someone else? Perhaps a blonde who always uses a toilet. Except for once in the ocean.
I mean I guess, I just have to... tell David that nothing can happen between us. Unless I don't... You know, complicated moral situation, no right, no wrong...
Wait, no, look at this! "Two bedroom, two bath, must be non-smoker, Satan worshipers okay..." Oh, yeah, but it's on the ground floor.
Hello. This is Phoebe Buffay. I was wondering, please, if-if it's not too much trouble, please, umm, might I speak to Miss Emily Waltham, please?
Umm, well he's very dashing, y'know, and umm, very, very sophisticated, and he doesn't speak any English, but according to his translator, he totally gets me.
Eight dollars and 27 cents. But not really, 'cause I put in the first two, just to, you know, get the ball rolling, and to make myself feel better.
Yeah, I met him when I was playing guitar in Washington Square Park. Ryan threw in salt water taffy 'cause he didn't have any change.
No, no, no, I know, I know, ooh. 'Hi, this is Katelynn, from Phoebe Buffay's office. Um, is um, Ann there for Phoebe, she'll know what it's about.'
Monica, if you get five cool points, you get to make somebody take off one item of clothing. It hasn't happened yet, but we're all very excited.
Fine. The reason that I was leaning a little bit more toward Rachel than you is just that you're ... just ... kinda high maintenance-Okay let's go to lunch!
Yeah well, that's 'cause Monica put me in charge of cups and ice, and Monica is gonna rue the day that she put me in charge of cups and ice.
It's ok. I thought of the perfect lie for you. It's easy to remember and doesn't invite a lot of questions. You weren't at the parade because you had a family emergency.
So you don't know that's Barney's the store! That can be y'know his friend's house, or a bar. Who has Barney's the store on their speed dial?
Okay fine! Fine! We'll just have to think of some other way to put the whole 'Who came onto who,' thing to rest! Come on now, think!!
Maybe your resolution is to not make fun of your friends, especially the ones who may soon be flying you to Europe for free on their own plane.
Yep! As long as you understand that I'm going to call my lawyer and once he puts you on the stand he'll make you look like a fool. A fool!
Oh, I Got Tired Of Naming States. So I Decided To List The Types Of Celery, And I Have One regular celery.
That's right, there you go! Crushes happen all the time! I know I've had them for all you guys. Well, except for Ross and Chandler. And I'm sure you've had them for us.
And then you say that it's almost midnight and you have to go because you don't wanna start the new year with me if you can't finish it. I'm gonna miss you. You scientist guy.
Wow, that sounds great! And what are you making Monica, in case Rachel's dessert is... so good that I eat all of it. There's none left for anybody else!
Well, ok, I wasn't rich like you guys, ok, I didn't eat gold and have a flying pony... I had a hard life, my mother was killed by a drug dealer.
Well, I didn't get embarrassed running next to Miss . But no, okay. No, no, I can see why running with me would be embarrassing to you. Yeah, okay. You're uptight.
I sound amazing. I, I, I've never heard myself sing before. I mean, except in my own head. Oh, this is so cool, now I can hear what you hear.
Yeah, but if I do tell him, then he's gonna hate myself. I mean look at him and his Mom, I can't. But, you guys can, please you gotta talk him out of it.
Yeah! It's so much better than first grade when you don't know what's going on and definitely better than third grade. Y'know with all the politics and mind games.
Yeah, I'm so good in this scene that I'm stealing focus from you. Well, rise to the challenge Tribianni 'cause I just raised the bar. Come join me up here!
For 99 cents, I'd eat you. Okay, I can totally settle down here. It's got everything I could ever want, including Joey! Look! Oh! Look! Hi!
Well, if you must know I have written 14 books. And as I am the only one who has read them, I can tell you that they all have been very well received.
Yes, while I was in the chair! That's why I take such good care of my teeth now, y'know, it's not about oral hygiene, I floss to save lives!
With the web, the spider she dies, she does. She has babies and dies. It's like ya know, hey welcome home from the hospital, thud.
Y'know what, I can stay, I'm gonna stay. 'Cause the last time I went skiing I was to afraid to jump off the chair lift, I just went around and around.
I've always wanted to live with a guy. "Pick up your socks!" "Put down the toilet seat!" "No! We're not having sex anymore!" It's gonna be fun!
Yeah, but he did have to have a bunch of stitches and he said that only once in a blue moon does a dog's ear grow back so...still hoping.
A new grocery store. The universe said I was going to meet a nice guy and that's what they gave me? When I get up there I'm going to kick some ass.
Hi. Um, I want to start with a song thats about that moment when you suddenly realize what life is all about. OK, here we go. OK, thank you very much.
I know who it is you remind me of. Evelyn Dermer. 'Course, that's before she got the lousy face lift. Now she looks like Soupy Sales.
Thank you. Okay, go! Go! Go! Now, if after dinner you still really need to bust someone, I know a hot dog vendor who picks his nose.
Unless... Maybe it's too crazy about this... Alright so... you know, there is no future... but that doesn't mean we still can't have fun. You know what? Forget what I said.
It's a...tarantula! Oh! God! Rachel, look, I'm sorry. What was I thinking giving Joey this big, gross, scary spider in such a poorly constructed cage?
'kay, see you there. Happy humping! Hey...hey! Oh, wow, somebody smoked out here? Oh my god, don't people know, you're not allowed to smoke in public spaces?
"Little, tiny Tarzan, swinging on a nose hair. Swinging with the greatest of ease..." Darn it! Now, I don't know who to get to the next verse.
Hey! So I had a great day, Rick and I really hit it off, and we started making out, and then my boss walked in and fired me for being a whore.
No-no, that's not, that's not me Phoebe, that's her pal Phoebe. According to her high school yearbook, they were like B.F.F. Best Friends Forever.
Hmm, pulling in a salary in the high six figures or rubbing gross naked people for chump change-ooh, what do I do?! What will I do?!
Well, I, I like the idea of naming him after someone I love, and Joey and Chandler are great names. But, all right, I don't-maybe I'll just name him The Hulk.
Or we could just follow your clever jokes &#150; any ideas? No! Didn't think so! Okay, c'mon guys, show us where the presents are!
And he's going to be paying this woman? Why doesn't he just give her like a throne, and a crown, and like a, you know, gold stick with a ball on top.
well you not what you should feel terrible about, this could have been my serious guy he was sweet and smart and funny. Do you know how hard it is to meet a guy like that?
You're right. You're right, he's just embracing life. We could all stand to be a little more like Parker. You know what? I am like him! I'm a sunny, positive person.
Would you stop that! Do you wanna know the first thing she said when she came back from her lunch with Richard? She didn't feel anything for him. She loves you!
Oh can I? Vegetarians never get to do the wishbone. It's really not fair either! You know, just because we don't eat the meat doesn't mean we don't like to play with the carcasses!
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I never got to be in a club. I-I didn't go to high school, but three of us would meet behind a dumpster to learn French. Bonjour.
Okay. 'Jingle bitch screwed me over! Go to hell jingle whore! Go to hell Go to hell. Go to hell-hell-hell.' That's all I have so far.
Here, Monica, look what I got to wear when I play at the restaurant uh, huh wait! Right? I mean, this might even class up the ballad of the uncircumcised man.
Oh, honey, honey, tell them the story about your patient who thinks things are, like, other things. Y'know? Like, the phone rings and she takes a shower.
Well, yeah! Fun is good, but y'know I also wanted to learn. Y'know, people are always talking about what they learned in high school and I never went to high school.
Ohh, no. Oh okay, so you're a cop which means you can park anywhere, 'cause I know that 'cause I'm a cop too. So, all right, keep up the good work. 10-4.
I'm sorry I won't be able to make it to your imaginary wedding, but I'm really busy that day. Yeah, I already have a unicorn baptism and a leprechaun bar mitzvah.
Well, this doesn't have to be so sad though. Y'know? Maybe instead of just thinking about how much you're gonna miss each other, you should like think of the things you're not gonna miss.
Yeah! I mean, I don't know. I was just , I was looking, I was looking in his eyes and I was just thinking: Oh my God! It's David. David's here. He's just, he's so irresistible.
Sometimes men love women, sometimes men love men, and then there are bisexuals, though some just say they're kidding themselves. la la-la-la la-la-la-la-la-la-la...
No, no, no, I wouldn't do you myself, I mean that would be weird. Yeah, no, I'll get one of the other girls to do it. Oh, this will be so much fun! Hey! Are you excited?
He is sweet. He's too sweet. He calls me all the time. "So did-did you get home from work okay?" "Did-did you get out of the shower okay?"
Platting goats are platting. Platting down the street. Platting goats are platting, leaving little treats. Does it even work without my sexy voice?
Yes, and it is my dying wish to have that ring. See, if I'm not buried with that ring then my spirit is going to wander the nether world for all eternity...
Oh my God! You got off easy! When my friend Silvie's husband said someone else's name in bed, she cursed him and turned his thingy green.
Ugh! No! This is so hard! I went through this whole book and found nothing! I want a name that's really like, y'know strong and confident, y'know? Like-like Exxon.
The most popular Phoebe in tennis is called the overhand Phoebe. And if you win, you must slap your opponent on the Phoebe and say, "Hi, Phoebe!"
Okay, well umm, I know that we haven't talked in a long time, but umm okay, our Mom is not our birth Mom. This-this other lady is our birth Mom.
Yeah, all right. Meanwhile, I'm gonna do whatever I can to help this so, I'm just gonna y'know, lie it your chair, Y'know? Yeah, good, I'm let gravity y'know, do its jobs.
I know. We didn't do any of the romantic things I had planned, like having a picnic at Central Park and ya know, coffee at Central Perk. Oh I just got that.
Monica, I'm sorry I didn't come by last night. I was out with Gary; he let me ride around with him in his cop car. We saw and prevented crimes.
Come, sit. Sit. Sit! Umm, all righty, before we get started I just-I need you to state for the official record that you are in fact Frank Buffay.
Oh, I don't know. Umm, how about the fact that the underwear out there on the telephone pole is yours from when you were having sex with Fun Bobby out on the terrace.
And there's a country called Argentinaaaa, it's a place I've never seeeeen. But I'm told for fifty pesos you can buy a human spleen. Humaaan spleeeeen. Ole!
Well, OK, the record company sent over this piece of paper for me to sign, saying that it's OK for someone else to sing for me. That was my first clue.
Well, it's not so much that you know, like I don't believe in it, you know, it's just...I don't know, lately I get the feeling that I'm not so much being pulled down as I am being pushed.
: It wasn't just that she was fat, the woman smelled like garbage! Everyone! It wasn't just that she was fat the woman smelled like garbaaaaaage! Classy, uh?
I'm not gonna. But you know what's cool though? Ok, if you had a friend named Pete, then I could say, 'Oh yeah, I know Pete, he's friends with my brother.'
This is the happiest dog in the world. I borrowed him from my friend Wendy. Now, you can only keep him until he cheers you up. And he will cheer you up!
I'm sorry, but sometimes they need help. That's fine. Go ahead and scoff. You know, there're a lot of things that I don't believe in, but that doesn't mean they're not true.
Yeah I know what I wanted to ask you. Um, can you roll your tongue? Because I can, and my Mom couldn't, and I thought y'know, I figured that was something I got from our Dad.
Okay, don't panic. I'm gonna go to the store, I'm gonna get you another set of nails, no one's gonna know, and you're gonna look great. Oh! Oh, it's 'cause they're gonna eat-that's the problem.
Y'know, I bet it would actually make my grandmother very happy to know that we're trying to figure out her recipe. I bet she's l-l-lookin' up at us and smiling right now.
I hate this. 'Cause I tell you, I had the most amazing two weeks planned for us, and almost everything I had in mind, we had to be a lot closer than this.
Okay. Then, take the tiara back and let me hold the musket again. Something's missing. It's not... Okay oh, let me see the ring my friend picked out.
Okay, well they are a huge responsibility, especially at this age. They require constant care. They-they need just the right food, and lot's and lot's of love.
Ooh, sorry. Um, and, and then you put your arms around me. And then you put your arms around me. And, um, and then you tell me that you love me and you'll never forget me.
Hey. Look, I know you've been really depressed lately, so I brought someone over to cheer you up. Right outside this door is a real, live, furry playmate.
Hey Ross! So listen, about you and the dinosaur girl, are you really just gonna let a couple of Nobel prizes scare you off? What is that, come on, a piece of paper?
You wouldn't! Okay look, Rachel I know you really want to do this, but I-I've never been maid of honor to anyone before! And I know you've done it at least twice!
I may play the fool at times, but I'm a little more than a pretty blond girl with an ass that won't quit. I believe this belongs to the father of your baby.
Yeah, she clamed she had to go out of town suddenly. She's avoiding me, she doesn't want to tell me where my Father is. She knows, and she won't tell me.
Ewww! And "Oh no!" It's-they just want me to be the surrogate. It's her-it's her egg and her sperm, and I'm-I'm just the oven, it's totally their bun.
Okay, umm, question 2) Umm, did that marriage end A. Happily, B. Medium, or C. In the total abandonment of her and her two children?
Oh! I'm sorry Rachel, I don't have time for your childish games, ok? I still have to go find something incredible to wear so I can beat Mike at "who's more over who"!
Yeah, ok. I guess you're right. Allright, so we should just give them away. But to nice families, with children, and reduced fat wheat thins. They're Bob's favorites.
Yes, yes I do. God, oh it's just perfect! Wow! I bet it has a great story behind it too. Did they tell you anything? Like y'know where it was from or...
Obviously I didn't think they were gonna start throwing things. I just thought if I kept insulting everyone, you would jump in and defend everyone and then you could look like the hero.
Yeah. I actually am, yeah. Y'know life-life's gonna had you all kinds of stuff, y'know you learn your little lessons and hopefully you grow. Wanna hear a new song?
Oh this, well I'm glad you asked. Now, don't you hate it when you have to cut a tin can with an ordinary steak knife? Ahh! Now, I know what you're thinking...
Yeah. You're just gonna knock on his door and change his life forever. You're like Ed McMahon except without the big check, or the raw sexual magnetism.
Excuse me? Could you help me with something? The patient I'm looking for has a broken leg and is in a wheelchair. And umm, he's like early to mid-thirties, very attractive.
Well you all know that I'm a pacifist so I'm not interested in war in any way. But y'know what? When the revolution comes, I will have to destroy you all. Not you Joey.
Yeah! As long as it's free! Food here is ridiculously over-p... Phoebe: Who's hoping the hand raising thing is still cute enough that you won't hate me?
No wait! Just-Okay-Just wait! You guys! Wait you guys! Don't make any rash decisions, okay? Just remember my promise, when we get married, three times a week.
No, no, no, oh no-no-no, it's has to be 800. 'Cause all those big companies have 800 numbers, every one. Yeah, every big Utah-based company has one.
Oh, look look look. The last candle's about to burn out. 10, 9, 8, 7... ... negative 46, negative 47, negative 48....
But then we ditch those two and that's when we get married. We'll have Chandler's money and Rachel's kids and getting custody will be easy because of Rachel's drinking problem.
You're in my office! Look, I have made a lot of cash for this company! Okay? I am talking big bucks! Pesos! Yen! Rubles! You make one little mistake...
Well hello, Mrs. Penella! Thank you so much for coming! Well, okay look, here's your umm, 3-D glasses and Reverend Pong will tell you when to put them on.
Wow, Joey and a professor! Can you imagine if they had kids and if the kids got her intelligence and Joey's raw sexual magnetism... Oh, those nerds will get laaaaaid!
Look, Ross, in this box are all the things I got from mugging that I thought were too special to sell... or smoke. Anyway, I was looking through it and I found "Science Boy"
Let's just play, ok. Good, ok. Here we go, double sixes, here we go... Here we go, come to mama, just getting ready to roll the dice...
Ohh, okay maybe they put your picture back up they can put you next to Matt Lauer. Look at him, smiling at me. Yeah I know; we'd be great together!
Mon... Marcia and Chester are planning on seeing a movie on Sunday night. Marcia thinks they're supposed to meet at six, Chester thinks it's at seven.
Yes, and now he's using this three divorces reason because he wants to stay married to her because he loves her. I must say, "Well done!" Bravo Meg.
Yeah. Let's see, my had Mom killed herself, and my Dad had run off, and I was living in a Gremlin with a guy named Cindy who talked to his hand.
Oh no, I don't believe in Western medicine. No, if you just apply pressure to these points right here. Then your hand starts to hurt and you still have a headache, so thanks.
So you like the drums! That's, that's great! Y'know, I was worried, that, you know, they would maybe an unbearable living situation. All right, okay, well, apparently not! So, yay!
I had a great time. It was really top drawer. And Here's Something Rich thirteen bathrooms in this place... I threw up in the coat closet... Ta taaa...
Well maybe he was just nervous, y'know you can be very intimidating. And besides I've met your pastry chef and she can stand to be taken down a peg or two.
Yeah! Well, I really liked that Lamaze class I took! Y'know and this time I thought I'd go for something, y'know a little more intellectual, with a less painful final exam.
Whoa!! That-okay, that's a lot of pressure on me and my uterus. So, well okay, so is there-is maybe is there something that I can do y'know just to like help make sure I get pregnant?
Please don't be a space ship. Please don't be a space ship. Oh thank God! How could you be beeping?! I just disconnected you! I took out your battery! How can...
Yeah, eight of them. That's 56 to him. You know also, if, if it's raining, you can't let him look up too long 'cause that cone'll fill up really really fast.
Fine! You go learn from your qualified instructor! But don't come crying to me when everyone's sick and tired of hearing you play Bad, Bad Leroy Brown!!
Yeah! How would you like it if I sent you to Lee Majors' house and told you that he liked you, and you went down there and you found out that he didn't like you? How would you feel?
Oh thank god. Oh, you changed your mind. Oh, look I know you probably want to be alone, and you don't want to talk about it, that's fine. I just want you to know, I think you are doing the right thing and...
Oh no-no, no, I made a promise to myself that the next time I would talk to Ursula would be over my dead body. And that's not happening 'til October 15th, 2032.
Well it's just-it's one of those situations that I just hate. Y'know? A massage client gave me three tickets to the Helmet-Pelts exhibit at the Morgan Chase museum.
Oh, I am having the best karma this week. First, I find this woman who knew my parents, and then my client with the fuzzy back gives me his beach house.
OK. I just met this producer of this like, teeny record company, who said that I have a very fresh, offbeat sound and she wants to do a demo of Smelly Cat.
Look David, if... if you had never left, then... yeah, we'd probably still be together right now, but... you did leave, and I-I'm with Mike and I really care about him...
Umm, my friend, Bonnie. She just always thought Ross was really cute, and now that you two aren't together, she asked if I could set it up, but if you're not cool with it...
What am I gonna do?! What am I gonna do?! I can't call my office they'll kill me! I can't call my clients they'll kill themselves! Great, now my chest hearts.
I'm in the shower and I'm writing a song. Stop me if you've heard it. My skin is soapy, and my hair is wet, and Tegrin spelled backward is Nirget.
'Right, well look, um, if Joey loses this audition, that is it for Estelle. I don't care! Annie you are a doll, what time can you see him?' I need a pen.
Knock, knock, knock, knock, hi. Um, could you please tell Sergei that um, I was fascinated by what Boutros Boutros Gali said in the New York Times.
Oh no, you're not supposed to be here. This is the staging area, you should, it's all wrong, you should leave, ya know, get out. Or perhaps you'd like a creme d'menthe.
Me too. Although this city is my home, so. So that's dumb what I said, don't tell him I said that. Umm, you make something up. Nice, thank you. This is me. Here.
Yes, and apparently he is married to some singer, but he said he would leave her for me. And I said, "James, James Brolin, are you sure?" James Brolin said...
Hi! Yeah, I'm calling on behalf of Monica Geller's eye, and is um, is Richard Burke in today. He's out of town, but does she want to see the on-call doctor?
Please! Please! Please! Please! Oh please! Please! Please! Frank and Alice asked me to baby sit the triplets and I'm nervous 'cause I've never done that before by myself!
Yes, yes, and it's, and we always have to go to, you know, someplace nice, you know? God, and it's not like we can say anything about it, 'cause, like this birthday thing, it's for Ross.
Ugly Naked Guy's taking his turkey out of the oven. Oh my god. He's not alone. Ugly Naked Guy's having Thanksgiving dinner with Ugly Naked Gal.
You're thinking about this way too much. Just tell him and get it over with. It's like, it's like ripping off this Band-Aid. Quick and painless, watch. Oh mother of...See?
I'm sooo sorry!! I just... I keep thinking about Mike! I'm crazy about David, and we're having so much fun together. Why-Why do I miss Mike? That's-that's gonna go away, right?
You mean whenever Monica and Chandler where like y'know doing laundry or going grocery shopping or-Oh! All that time Monica spent on the phone with sad Linda from camp!
That she's gonna move in with you and maybe then she'll fall in love with you and then when she finds out you're already married, she'll just be happy. Y'know? You're just, you're very sad.
All right, all right, we'll just do our best. Okay? So let's say I'm the interviewer and I'm meeting you for the first time. Okay. "Hi! Come on in, I'm uh, Regina Philange."
Yeah! Why would my mother send me a fur? Doesn't she know me but at all! Plus, I have a perfectly fine coat that no innocent animal suffered to make!
I know, I know! I'm like playing the field. Y'know? Like, juggling two guys, I'm sowing my wild oats. Y'know? Y'know, this kind've like y'know oat-sowin', field-playin' juggler.
Yeah, he's really great though. He has this incredible zest for life, and he treats me like a queen, except at night when he treats me like the naughty girl I am.
That sucks! That's not a trip! I just came from the park! What are we gonna high five about at the stupid Central Park? "Well, it's right by my house, all right!"
Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Umm, could-could I get a copy of that? 'Cause Carol threw it out, she lost ours. She's such a scatterbrain, but man what a hot piece of ass.
You know, now you're more like, you know like, "Mr. Caring Boss," "Mr.", you know, "I'm one of you, Boss," "Mr., I wanna be your buddy, Boss Man Bing!"
Ha-ha. No, it's just I'm so pregnant that I-my guitar doesn't fit anymore. So I thought 'til I'm not, I'm just gonna play all my songs on this drum. It sounds really cool!
Yeah no, I'm telling you Rachel has such a great eye for this stuff. Ross, y'know if you ever decide you need to redecorate-And I think that you should. You should, you should ask Rachel to help.
No! But she gave me the box that it came in. It had a picture of the bike on the front. So I would sit on it and my step-dad would drag me around the backyard.
I can be a waitress. OK watch this. Um, gimme two number ones, 86 the bacon, one Adam and Eve on a raft and rick'em, la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la.
Yeah! Let's do that!! That-that sounds good. We should sit down and talk, just me, my lover Carol, and the Stings. Umm, how-how will I get in touch with them?
She was acting, she was pretending like she hasn't heard from him on years, but I found this picture on her fridge, and look ! Isn't this what he would look like now?
Umm... Wow, all right. Wow! Yay! Ooh, I'm gonna meet a guy! And really soon! And he's gonna be the man of my dreams. Probably not the guy I had a dream about last night.
Oh please! Just before when you were asleep in the lounge! That Armenian family was watching you instead of the TV. Oh, that reminds me. That Mr. Hasmeje still has my Gameboy.
Yeah, yeah, I'm going to be out there spreading joy to the people. I mean, last year, I spread a little joy but not really enough. So this year, I'm going to do the whole city.
You know, what I think is so great that you are totally into this person and yet for all you know she could be like 90 years old, or have two heads, or. It could be a guy.
No, I made myself take an oath. Yeah, no fooling around with clients and umm, always be prepared. Yeah, that one's actually from the Boy Scouts, but it just makes good sense.
Yeah, I should go to, `cause I'm playing in one hour. Hey, you guys should come hear me, ooh hear me. Ooh, My sticky shoes--eww! Eww! I lost my sexy phlegm!
Okay. I have just a few questions to ask so I'm going to get out my official forms. Okay, so, question 1) You and uh, you were married to Francis' daughter Lilly, is that correct?
You don't have to be awake to be my man, As long as you have brainwaves I'll be there to hold your hand. Though we just met the other day, There's something I have got to say...
Oh wait, one sec. One sec. Hey you! Behind the glass! Who are you looking at! I've always wanted to say that when I was in one of these rooms, which was never!
Go Charlie! But my point is, ok so she dated them but she also broke up with them. Maybe she's looking to, you know, slum it with some average Joe Phd.
OK, hi. For your information this is exactly what I wanted. This is a tattoo of the earth as seen from a great distance. It's the way my mother sees me from heaven.
Hey, you know what might help you deal with it? Think of it this way, you and Emily are in the past and you can't be mad about the past. So are you still mad about the Louisiana Purchase?
"...fuchsia and mauvvve. Those are the 66 colours of my bedroommmm." Thank you, thank you. Ohh, and I invite you to count the colours in your bedroom. Except for you. You go away.
Yeah. You're trying to figure out where you know me from? All right, I'll give you a hint. From porn! Okay? Yeah your pervert boyfriend watched me in a porno movie! See?
Oh, great! We couldn't keep our eyes off each other all night and then every once and a while y'know, he'd kinda lean over and stroke my hair and touch my neck.
Raindrops on roses and rabbits and kittens, bluebells and sleighbells and- something with mittens... La la la la...something and noodles with string. These are a few...
Well, yeah, because I have to break up with someone, and... Okay so Jason is sensitive, but now so's Vince Plus, Vince has the body y'know? So... It's really just about the math.
I know. It's just y'know usually when you're, when you're done with the pregnant thing, y'know, then you get to do the mom thing. I'm gonna be y'know, sitting around in my leather pants, drinking Tequila.
Uh-huh, yeah that's too bad. I really want to go to his concert Friday night, but it's totally sold out. I know! Why don't you meet him and get tickets?! If you get two I'll take you.
What the hell is this?! What, did you actually thought it would make me feel better to give me stuff that I can't use for another two months?! This sucks! All right, what's my next present?!
Oh! It will be fun! Ohh! Yay! Oh! Okay, ooh, let's plan the wedding reception. Wow! You really wanted me to do something with this van. Y'know what, I want you to take the chef job.
Okay, then you don't know what it feels like when one of them comes back. Do you? I believe this is my Mother. Even if I'm wrong, who cares? Just be a friend. Okay? Be supportive.
Hey, Joey! Hey! Ooh! Ooh! I just say someone on the-that looks just like you on the subway. And I was gonna go over and say 'hi!' but then I figured, he doesn't care if he looks like you.
You guys were right. He's just too excited about...everything. I mean I'm all for living life, but this is the Geller's 35th anniversary. Okay? Let's call a spade a spade this party stinks.
Oh well, what do you know, there goes my identical twin sister. Just walkin' along looking like me. What, is this just like a freakish coincidence, or did you know she takes this train?
Well not so much a pet as, you know, an occasional visitor who I put food out for, you know. Kinda like Santa. Except Santa doesn't poop on the plate of cookies.
Well, you know what Chandler? I think you've gotta face it. You're like, the guy in the big office, you know. You're the one that hires them, that fires them... They still say you're a great boss.
Yes you do! This is your third divorce! You love divorce so much you're probably gonna marry it! Then it won't work out and you're gonna have to divorce it, divorcing guy. I'm so drunk.
Chandler, you gotta stop staring at the door. It's like a watched pot, you know if you keep looking at it then the door is to, never gonna boil. I think what you have to do is try not to...
Hey. Ursula's fiance is really sweet! He's a teacher, he does all this volunteer work. Y'know normally y'know, I don't like really sweaty guys. But this one? I could just mop him up!
Oh no, no, no, no, no, no. Don't get me wrong. No, he's not in like a sissy way. No, no, no... when he gets going, he can rattle a headboard like a sailor on leave...
No, no, no, I actually it's any baby animals: kittens, fish babies... You know... especially veal... and this, this nice vein of fat running through it... Hmmm... yummy Hmmm...
No-no-no, but I am mad! I am mad! Because this stuff is everything that is wrong with the world! And it's all sitting up in my living room and all I can think about is how I don't have that lamp!
No, that was my way of telling you. Well, it turns out he's incredibly sensitive, he keeps a journal and he paints. He even showed me charcoal drawings that he drew of me.
Umm, well I, I kinda had a little chat with Alice, and I sort of made her see why you two shouldn't be together, y'know. And you're gonna see it to, one day, you really, really will.
No. This game is grotesque. Twenty armless guys joined at the waist by a steel bar, forced to play soccer forever. Ahh, hello, human-rights violation.
Ok, all right, let's hear about the kiss. Was it like, was it like a soft brush against your lips? Or was it like a, you know, a "I gotta have you now" kind of thing?
I couldn't tell him no. He got so sad. Maybe it'll be all right. I do really like him a lot and probably do it eventually anyway and plus, think of all the money I'll save on stamps.
I don't know, but we're having dinner tomorrow night, so I figured, she's gonna tell me then. Y'know maybe she just wanted to give him time to, buy me presents, I don't know! So, you're all bored?
Sparkly. So, wow, this is pretty wonerful, huh. Mr. major capades guy. I, I remember when you were just, like, King Friday in Mr. Roger's Ice is Nice.
All right, y'know forget hypnosis. The way to quit smoking is you have to dance naked in a field of heather, and then bath in the sweat of six healthy young men.
Okay. So, this wire is connected to this wire which plugs into here. Okay so, to get the beeping to stop all I have to do... Well done, Pheebs. What do you want from me?!!!!!!!
Oh right, ok um. Ok so its not just the lie you tell. but its the way you tell it. . For example if you look down at the ground when you're talking, people know you're lying.
Well, umm, not much. But, I was just thinking that since those guys just got engaged that maybe it would be nice if they had some privacy, y'know? So, could I just move in with you for a couple days?
Okay. Okay. I-Okay umm...this...I-I sent my friend Joey in here to find out stuff about you. Umm y'know, if it helps you came off great. A lot better than I'm coming off right now.
No! I definitely don't wanna get married. No I just wanted to make sure you didn't want to too. Whew! Coz you know when we move in and you start changing your mind there's gonna be hell to pay mister!
OK, no. For your information I'm going to see him so I can put all those feeling behind me. OK, and the reason I'm dressed like this is because I think it's nice to look nice for your gay husband.
Wow, a year and a half ago I didn't even know I had a brother, and now I have a sister too. Okay. Okay. Stop it, don't. So, I gotta get you a gift now. Is there anything you need?
Yeah, y'know what I noticed Rachel? He scares easy. Is that the kind of guy you'd like to take to a ball? "Hey Sebastian, would you like to dance?" "Uhh, okay-I gotta go!"
Umm, look we don't, we don't really know each other so it would be really easy to just forget about this, but there seems to be something between us. And I don't know about you but that doesn't happen to me a lot.
Okay. There may be a way that we can get the other ring back. 'Cause I heard the guy tell the jeweler where he was going to propose. So maybe we can get him to trade rings or something.
Yes! I know! I know! Yeah! So the baby is totally craving meat. This afternoon I tried tricking it, I made it a soy-burger to make it think it was getting meat, y'know? And I got nauseous.
Okay, stop! Larry, okay, can't you just be Larry and not Larry the health inspector guy? Y'know I mean it was really exciting at first but now it's like, okay, so where are we gonna eat ever?
Of course not! And you're gonna love Mary Ellen. She's really smart and cute and funny, and I can't tell you how I know this, but she' not opposed to threesomes. So tell me some about my guy.
I'm so, so, so sorry, Joey. I definitely am gonna see you're play. I swear you're play is very important to us, thank you for your patience. You're play is the next play is the next play I'm gonna see.
Oh great! And listen, could you do us a favor and not tell Chandler and Monica about this? 'Cause y'know umm, they don't-they don't have any kids of their own and-and this door was like a child to them.
But everybody sings. It's so much fun! Last time this adorable old man got out there, forgot all of the words, flipped outand everyone booed him off the stage. So funny.
Good, but wait. Okay, all right, here we go. Now I want you to relax. Take a deep breath. Clear your mind. Which do you like better peanut butter or egg whites?
Please, I almost fell for that with, uh, Pride of the Yankees, I thought I was gonna see a film about Yankee pride and then, boom, the guy gets Lou Gehrig's disease.
No, Mike, I don't want to kill him! I thought we were just gonna capture him and, and you know, set him free in the country side where he can maybe meet a friendly possom and a wisecracking owl.
OK. Ooh, OK, you gotta give me a second, I wanna get this just right. Dude, 11 o'clock, totally hot babe checkin' you out. That was really good, I think I'm ready for my penis now.
Well, freaked. 'Cause it turns out that the odds are really sucky. And! This is Frank and Alice's like only shot. Like, they are literally putting all of their eggs in my basket.
Hello. My name is Regina Phalange. I'm a businesswoman in town on business. Would you like to see my card? Ooh, what did I do with my file-a-facts? I must've left it in conference room B.
Oh, it's like huge weight has been lifted! 'Cause look, no hair loss, not a rash, no hives, I'm just so happy! Because no shortness of breath, no temporary euphoria-Oh.
Maybe not! Y'know? Seriously, three babies are a handful maybe they're y'know, looking for a chance to unload one of them. Listen, I-I hate to miss an opportunity just because I didn't ask! Y'know?
I'll get it, okay. Hi, Monica and Rachel's. Yeah, just a second, can I ask who's calling. Oh, ew, it's Michelle! Ew! She, she must have that Caller Id thing. You should get that.
Yeah, I've discovered that Ross forgot to take his brain medicine, uh, now without it, uh, in the brain of Ross, uh women's names are interchangeable, through-through no fault of his own.
Oh God, I tried everything to make myself feel better. I even tried writing a song about it... but... I can't think of anything that rhymes with AARRGGHH!! Hey Monica, I really need your help getting through this...
Yeah! It really has been great too, you know, some of this people must have seen me play before because they were requesting a bunch of my songs! Yeah, "You suck" and "shut up and go home".
No, 'cause you just said dad and everywhere I go today I keep getting signs telling me to go see my father. Like when I was walking over here and I passed a buffet...which is my father's last name.
Hey! I've got a great idea for party favors for the shower. Okay, we get some uh mahogany boxes and carve everyone's names in them and inside is everyone's individual birth stone.
Because at that time you see, I thought everything that rhymed was true. So I thought y'know that if I'd work with stocks, I'd have to live in a box, and only eat lox, and have a pet fox.
I didn't watch the ending, I was too depressed. It just kept getting worse and worse, it should have been called, "It's a sucky life and just when you think it can't suck any more it does."
I'm sorry, Monica, I'm really happy you got promoted, but cold cucumber mush for thirty-something bucks? No! Rachel just had that, that, that salad, and, and Joey with his like teeny pizza! It's just...
Yeah, my mom sent me a family heirloom that once belonged to my grandmother. Can you believe it?! A year ago I didn't even have a family, and now I have heirlooms for crying out loud.
Check it out. Okay, I can play this when the guests are coming in. Okay. "First Time I Met Chandler, I Thought He Was Gay. But here I am singing on his wedding day!"
Oh whoa-whoa-whoa! Wait a minute, open up your hand; let me take a look. Quarter. Dime. Lint? Not interested in that. What's this? A Canadian coin? Get outta here!
Oh y'know what's sadder than this? Bambi. I cried for three days with that movie. No wait two! Because on the third day my mother killed herself so I was partly crying for that.
Don't be worried about that! Your tombstone can say whatever you want it to say! It could say, Ross Geller, Good at Marriage! Y'know? Mine's gonna say Phoebe Buffay, Buried Alive.
Well, if I'm going down, I'm taking you with me. Harboring a fugitive? That's one to three years minimum. Good luck Chandler. Okay, you can arrest me. Fine. But you'll never make it stick and you know it!
'Cause you're still into Monica. So you told her there was somebody else so she would agree to work with you, so 'cause you figure oh if you spent a lot of time together, maybe something might happen, and...
Food here at 'Javu'..will kill you..the food here at 'Javu' ...will kill you.. Monica: Thank god, it's just you! I thought someone was swinging a bag of cats against the wall.
Wrong? Really? You know the word wrong. Everything isn't perfect? Everything isn't magical? Everything isn't a glow with the light of a million fairies? They were just brake lights, Parker!
Oh okay, it's P as in Phoebe, H as in hoebe, O as in oebe, E as in ebe, B as in bee-bee and E as in 'Ello there mate!
Well it's only like my favorite bay! {Actually, it's not bad. It just gets a little cold in winter, but in Wisconsin winter only lasts from August to June. J }
I'm just saying, get his number just in case. But no Chandler is in an accident and can't perform sexually and he would want you to take a lover to satisfy the needs that he can no longer fulfill.
New York City has no power, and the milk is getting sour. But to me it is not scary, 'cause I stay away from dairy.... la la la, la la, la la...
Oh, okay! "Would I go back to Allesandro's? Sure, but I'd have to order two meals, one for me and one for the guy pointing the gun to my head." Wow! You really laid into this place.
Ok, um, hi, hello, hi, ok, so, um, this is a song about a love triangle between three people that I made up. Um, it's called, um, "Two of Them Kissed Last Night".
Well, let's see, it's not. Really, like that. Because, you see that was an actual problem, and uh, yours is just like y'know a bunch of y'know high school crap that nobody really gives y'know...
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know. You know, I mean, on the one hand, Mother may I? But y'know on the other hand... No. No, I can't. We're friends. No, oh, no. I don't want to risk what we have.
Love is sweet as summer showers, love is a wondrous work of art, but your love oh your love, your love...is like a giant pigeon...crapping on my heart. La-la-la-la-la- Thank you. La-la-la-la...ohhh!
Hey you guys wait! Guys! This place is so much better than London! Okay? This lady dressed like Cleopatra gave me a coupon, 99 cent steak and lobster dinner. Huh!
Sure, yeah, no I can do that, yeah, because umm, y'know, the muscles in the siadic area can get y'know, real nice and tight. So umm, tell me Rick, how umm, how did you injure the area.
Oh wait a second you guys...for the last couple weeks I've been that guy everywhere I go. We take the same bus. We go to the same bookstore, the same dry cleaners; maybe he's the tea guy.
Don't feel bad. You know they used to like you a lot. But then you got promoted, and, you know, now you're like "Mr. Boss Man". You know, Mr. Bing. Mr. Bing, "Boss Man Bing".
I made a man with eyes of coal And a smile so bewitchin', How was I supposed to know That my mom was dead in the kitchen? La lalala la la la la lalala la la...
Yeah, well, everybody does! I'm a really cool person. And y'know you had 29 years to find that out, but you didn't even try! Y'know what, you walked out on me, and I'm just, I'm gonna do the same thing to you.
Just, you know, long time ago. Well, when men used to tell women what to do - a lot. And then there was suffrage, which is a good thing but is sounds horrible. Do you want to get this tattoo?
Yeah, um, in Albany, can I have the number of Frank Buffay. . . OK, um, in Ithica. . . alright, um, Saratoga. . . Oneonta. Alright, you know what, you shouldn't call youself information.
Hey, you should really read that book you wrote. Wow! You saw the hat in the kitchen and knew that she'd have to go in there hatless to get it. You can have your own health inspector detective show!
No, no, I am against innocent trees being cut down in their prime, and their, their corpses grotesquely dressed in like tinsel and twinkly lights. Hey, how do you sleep at night?
Hmm, okay, total abandonment. Okay, reasons for abandonment, A. Top secret government work, B. Amnesia, or C. Or you're just a selfish, irresponsible bad, bad man?
Oh yeah. You know, I don't know if I was happier when um George Bailey destroyed the family business or um, Donna Reid cried, or when the mean pharmacist made his ear bleed.
That was supposed to be a good thing, I forget why. Just listen, Monica, I, do you know, okay, do you know, I couldn't sleep for like a month because I got like a dot of ink on one of the sofa cushions.
Oh good, ok. Oh nooo, I have to go because I'm late for my um, Green Eggs and Ham discussion group. Um tonight it's why he would not eat them on a train. Have fun bye.
Well, hey, what if Kenny were the real brains behind the whole company? You know. What if Kenny hired that Ralph Lauren guy to be the pretty front man? Huh, did she ever think of that?
Oh, I believe it. I think the baby can totally hear everything. I can show you. Look, this will seem a little weird, but you put your head inside this turkey, and then we'll all talk, and you'll hear everything we say.
Oh, ok, you want me to marry Mike? Alright, well, let's just gag him and handcuff him and force him down the aisle. I can just see it: "Mike, do you take Phoebe..." You know, it's every girl's dream!
Oh! Since tomorrow. I met this really cute guy in the park and he like y'know, jogs, and blades, and swims, and so y'know we made a deal that's he's going to teach me all sorts of jock stuff.
Oohh, um, no, I don't think that's the problem. 'Cause we went, um, dancing the other night and the way he held me so close, and the way he was looking into my eyes I just like... definitely felt something.
Well, I mean, I'm not my sisters, you know, whatever, and um... I mean, its true, we were one egg, once, but err, you know, weve grown apart, so, um... I dont know, why not? Okay.
Yeah that's right Chandler does still think I'm pregnant. He hasn't asked me how I'm feeling or offered to carry my bags. Boy, I feel bad for the woman who ends up with him. After you of course.
Oh, I love you guys too, but Mike got off work early. Wait. Wait, I'm not t-not that kind of girl that just ditches her friends to be with her boyfriend. You know what? I am. Bye guys! Judy! Bye.
Yuh-huh! I was the last one to know when Chandler got bitten by the peacock at the zoo. I was the last one to know when you had a crush on Joey when he was moving in. Looks like I was second to last.
I'm, I'm freaking out! Monica kinda trusted me with something and she shouldn't have! All right, I haven't lived here in a while, so I have to ask you something. Does Monica still turn on the lights in her bedroom?
I know, but that creep that I went on that date with goes to there so I have to find a new one. I also have to find a new video store, a new bank, a new adult bookstore, a new grocery store...
Okay that's even sadder. Look, I know, I know what I got myself into, it's just that now that they're in me it's like, it's like I know them y'know, I mean-I mean, it's just not gonna be easy when these little babies have to go away.
Pretty big? It's huge! God, this guy doesn't have a clue! He's just walking down the street thinking, 'I had sex with Rachel Green. I rock!' then bam! He's a father and everything's different.
Anyway, I'm going out with Sergei again tonight, and um, could you come and be the translator's date? So that when we, it's time for our alone time, you two could split off. Y'know, he's really, he's kinda cute.
Wow, what is with all the negativity? You sound like Monican't , not Monican... ...Monica. Look, you know, you have been playing around with this catering thing for over three years. Do you want to be a caterer or not?
Oh! I can't believe it. I can't believe this. We're just like, sitting at home, trying to guess Joey's fingers, and you guys are out like partying and having fun, and you know, all, "hey, Blowfish, suck on my neck".
There'll be times when you get older when you'll want to sleep with people just to make them like you. . . But don't. Cause that's another thing that you don't wanna do, everybody That's another thing that you don't wanna do.
I don't accept this rule. When me make plans, I expect you to show up. Okay, I can't just be a way to kill time 'til you meet someone better! Y'know boyfriends and girlfriends come and go, but this is for life!
Okay y'know what you have to choose. All right, if-if the most important thing on the planet to you is this cat poopy thing then, okay you can have Smelly Cat, but we won't be partners. So what's it gonna be?
Whoa-whoa-whoa! No drinks near the bucket! Set it down over there and then you can make a contribution! And you can leave the hurt bunny look over there too! Hi Bob! I thought I told you to get outta here!
No but, why does that have to be a bad thing. Just change what it means. Y'know? Go down there and prove your Mother wrong. Finish the job you were hired to do, and we'll call that pulling a Monica.
All right, I've never been engaged and I've never really been married, but I can only tell you what my mother told me. Whenever you have doubts or fears or anxieties about a relationship, do not communicate them to your husband.
Ohh, they gave me a great spot. Right by Macys. Yeah, they hardly ever give such a good spot to a rookie, but I'm the only one who can sing "Merry Christmas" in 25 languages. I lied.
Well, he's kinda like the guy I went to see that with. Except, except he-he's smarter, and gentler, and sweeter... I just- I just wanna be with him all the time. Day and night, and night and day... and special occasions...
Hi, this Phoebe from Empire Office Supplies, can I speak to your supply manager please? Earl, thanks. Hi Earl, this is Phoebe from Empire Office Supplies I'd like to talk to you about your toner needs.
Okay. Umm look, you're coming on a little strong. But I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt, because it seems the universe really wants to be together. So, why don't we just start over okay? And you can just tell me about yourself.
Ok, somebody is on their way to ruin wedding okay. And I have to warn somebody, alright. So if you don't give me that number then I'm going to come over there and kick your snooty ass all the way to New Glocken..shire.
I dunno, let's see! So, okay, I dreamt that we were gonna get married, and he left, becuz he had to go fight a fire. And, um, so okay, I went to a night club, and I saw him making out with a girl.
All right so Earl, let's just forget about the people at the office, okay? There-there's gotta be someone else in your life worth sticking around for! What about-what about your family, your friends, or maybe your girlfriend?
Ninety percent of a women's pheromones come out the top of her head! That's why, that's why women are shorter. So that men will fall in love when they hug them! Oh come on Ross, you're a scientist.
...sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle;and away they all flew like the down of a thistle; but I heard him exclaim, ere he drove out of sight, "Merry Christmas to all, and to all a goodnight!"
Okay, you guys. You guys I think I know what's going on here. Okay, you guys... STOP!! I know that, I know that you're acting mad because you think that it'll make it easier to leave. But deep down you're still really sad. Deep-deep down.
Okay. Okay, here's what we're gonna do. Okay, I'm gonna break into this mini-van and put it in neutral. You guys push it forward so Ross can drive out of his spot. Okay? All right, here we go. Haul ass!!!!
Ooh! No, no, no, no, he's not like a kook, no. He's just like this, this very passionate, incredibly romantic guy, that got like a tinsy bit carried away, you know. And we just get along really well, and he's so cute.
Ooh-Ooh! I did it! I did it! I figured out a way to make money! I'm gonna open up my own massage place and Frank's gonna help me! And! We can work it around his schedule so he doesn't have to quit school!
Oh yeah, I've done it for years. I actually stopped because I was so accurate. Y'know, and-and y'know, one of the great joys of life is it's-it's wondrous unpredictability. Y'know? And also tea tends to give me the trots.
No, no, no. It's not! It's not my mom. It belonged to mom. Yeah, no, she used to put it out every Christmas to remind us, that even though it's Christmas, people still die. And, you can put candy in it.
Well, I heard you're having a problem with one of the boys in your class. And so I thought I would just come down here and sit you both down, have a little talk and make it all okay. Now umm, the boy's name is Sting's son.
Nothing! You have apologized to her like a million times and she's been nothing but terrible to you. And don't forget you just threw her daughter a lovely, albeit slightly boring, shower, and she hasn't even thanked you for it.
No! Rachel, that's what they want me to do. My warranty expires tomorrow, if I don't get through, they're not gonna fix my crappy, broken phone for free! We cannot let them win! It's us versus them!
she's a lucky, lucky lady! So, where are you going to-what the mother of crap is up with this stuff? Oh, God. Is it gum, is it food? What's the deal? Oh, it's nice! May I try a pink one?
No. No, he is my submaring guy. He resurfaces like every couple years and we have the most amazing three days together. Only this time he's coming for two weeks. Two whole weeks, which means yay.
Y'know that's really fair. Y'know? Most guys who have been divorced three times are like 60. Ross, nobody cares about this except you! This-this embarrassment thing is all in your head! Here, I'll show you! Come here.
No, I know, I'm just nervous. Y'know it's just y'know Mom's dead, don't talk to my sister, Grandma's been sleeping a lot lately. It's like the last desperate chance to have a family, y'know, kinda thing. You're so sweet to wait with me.
Yeah, I talked to my grandma about the Old Yeller incident, and she told me that my mom used to not show us the ends of sad movies to shield us from the pain and sadness. You know, before she killed herself.
It was really sweet. The last thing she said to me was; "Okay dear, you go get the eggs and I'm gonna get the yogurt and we'll meet at the checkout counter." And y'know what? We will meet at the checkout counter.
How could it not be? I mean pretty soon they're gonna be having kids, and then they're just gonna be hanging out with other couples who have kids. And then maybe they're gonna have to leave the city to be near a Volvo dealership.
Okay, umm, it's this tragic love story between Cathy and Heathcliff and umm, it takes place on like these really creepy mores in England. Which I think represents the wildness of Heathcliff's character. I totally get symbolism.
C'mon you guys. It's a known fact that lobsters fall in love and mate for life. You know what, you can actually see old lobster couples walkin' around their tank, ya know, holding claws like. . .
There's a reset button?! Ugh, thank you! Thank you! There's a reset button! My God! Why didn't I see that! Reset button, reset button, where is there a reset button? Oh here it is! Oh! Ohh, God!
oh, oh, oh! This is so great! Oh my god! This was not at all scary. Hi everybody. Hi Betty! Betty, Hi! You found Betty! Oh my god! This is great. Everybody I love is in the same room, Where's Joey?
I think it's just y'know that I haven't been with a guy in so long and how sometimes you're looking for something and you just don't even see that it's right there in front of you sipping coffee-Oh no, have I said to much? Well it's just something to think about. I know I will.
My grandmother has this new boyfriend, and they're both kind of insecure in bed. Oh, and deaf. So they're constantly, like, having to reassure each other that they're having a good time. You have no idea how loud they are!
They're tiny and chubby and so sweet to touch, and soon they'll grow up and resent you so much. Now they're yelling at you and you don't know why, you cry and you cry and you cry. And you cry and you cry and you cry...
Okay, stop tormenting me! This mink! Okay, they're mean! And they hate squirrels! And y'know, okay, most of these probably wanted to be coats! All right, fine, now I get it. Here. You take it. Are you happy now? I'm cold!
What?! He was with her when he wrote this poem. Look, 'My vessel so empty with nothing inside. Now that I've touched you, you seem emptier still.' He thinks Monica is empty, she is the empty vase!
I'm just, I'm, I'm, I'm used to playing for grown-ups. Ya know, they just, grown-ups drink their coffee and do their grown-up thing, ya know, and kids listen. This is a huge responsibility. What? Are you gonna kiss me?
Yeah, maybe, yeah. You know, and, and I'll knock on the door and, and he'll hug me and I'll have a dad. Ya know and I'll, I'll go to his pharmacy and everyone will be really nice to me 'cause, you know, I'm Franks daughter.
Good. It's just so hard, it's hard for me to ... let them go. I guess it just brings back memories, you know, from ... when I gave birth to my brother's triplets and I had to give them up. I haven't told you about that yet, have I?
Oh, come on! Yes, remember that time on the frozen lake? We were playing chess, you said I was boring, and then you took off your energy mask and you were Cameron Diaz! Okay, there's a chance this may have been a dream.
I just-I just started walking around not knowing what to do next, y'know? I-I started asking people on the street if they wanted massages. Then these policemen, thought I was a whore too. It's been a really bad day, whore wise.
Ok. I mean I know I did the right thing. You know, Mike never wants to get married and I shouldn't be in a relationship that has no future... but... pretty soon I'm gonna miss him so much. I'm gonna wanna see him again and you have to stop me from doing that.
Yeah, I like Vince a lot, y'know? But, it's just Jason's so sensitive, y'know? And in the long run, I think sensitive it's just better than having just like a really, really, really nice butt. Jason! Definitely Jason! Okay, wish me luck!
Oh... Mike's sister just invited me to a party tonight, he's gonna be there. And she was like "Oh, don't worry! I asked him. He's totally ok with seeing you!". So now I have to go so he'll think that I'm totally ok with seeing him!
...and then it goes back to the chorus... Smelly cat, Sme-lly ca-t / I-t's not your fau-lt. And that's the end of the song... I realise that you didn't ask to hear it, but uhm... no-one had spoken in seventeen minutes.
No! Because he's in love with the British chippy! Look, Rachel, if you go, you're just gonna mess with his head and ruin his wedding! Y'know, it's too late! You missed you're chance! I'm sorry, I know this must be really hard, it's over.
Oh, I'm still mad at them but I also now that they bring happiness to lots of kids who's moms didn't kill themselves, so by supporting them, I'm doing a good thing, but I'm not happy about it. So there, a selfless good deed.
Yeah, I should probably take it back. Ooh, but you know what? While I'm at the police station, I could check their Ten Most Wanted lists because my friend Fritzy has been like number 11 forever, so this could be her year!
Ooh, I can't do this. My mom was right. If I can't-if I can't give him up, then there's no way I can give up a baby. Ohh, God, Frank and Alice are gonna be so crushed. What-what else, what else can I give 'em-a kidney!
What if the husband person is the wrong guy, and you are the right guy. I mean you don't get chances like this all the time, if you don't meet her now, you're gonna be kicking yourself when your 80, which is hard to do, and that's how you break a hip.
I know! So this woman probably could like have all kinds of stories about my parents, and she might even know like where my Dad is. So I looked her up, and she lives out by the beach. So maybe this weekend we could go to the beach?
I found you in my bed! How'd you whined up there? You are a mystery! Little black curly hair! Little black curly hair! Little black, little black, little black, little black, little black curly hair............
All right, betting and wagering of any kind, are, I'm sure, not permitted in the happy place. Okay. Just-just, you know, the-the lovely waterfalls, and the, the trickling fountains. And the-the calming sounds of the babbling brook....
Because I was ashamed ok? I sold out for the cash! And then they give me benefits like medical, and dental, and a 401K. But you know... you pay a price. Now I'm this Corporate stooge and punching a clock and Ugh! paying taxes!
Oh. It's just so unexpected! I...I uh...Boy I'll tell you it's just such an honor to be nominated for a Nobel Prize and y'know to win one for a massage. Especially after having just won a Tony award for best actress in...
Well, I'm going to the dentist, so listen, okay, just be on the look out for anything that, that, that you can fall into, or, or that can fall on you, or... All right, just look out! Okay, And um, I also just wanna, I just wanna tell you all that um......
No, it's just like, ya know, it's a whole mess of stuff, ya know. It's like, yesterday, ya know, my dad was this, like, famous Burma tree surgeon guy and, ya know, now he's a, a pharmacist guy and. . .
Okay. Ooh, I'm setting the phone down. But I'm still here! Just don't go anywhere I'm still here. Don't-don't switch or anything, 'cause I'm, I'm right here. Just one sec. One sec! One second!! Wait! One second! Just...
Okay. Okay, let's say I bought a really great pair of shoes. Do you know what I'd hear, with every step I took? 'Not-mine. Not-mine. Not-mine.' And even if I was happy, okay, and, and skipping- 'Not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not-mine'...
But, I mean, do you think he's gonna enjoy it when he's up to his elbows in the diapers from all the babies they have to have right away?! This is not fair to Frank, and it-it's not fair to the babies, and y'know what, it's not good home economics.
I did it! One mile on a hippity-hop! That's it!! That's everything I wanted to do before I was thirty. Oh, except I wanted to patch things up with my sister. But oh well. Yay!! And-and girls this thing is a Godsend if you know what I mean.
Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God!! So I-I mean so in a few months I'm going to have three full grown babies just walkin' around inside me?! Oh! Oh! And it's gonna be one of those log rides where they just come shooting out!
Ha-ha, that's great, ha-ha. I can't wait to hear the rest of it, ya know, but I really have to go to the bathroom so... Hey, come with me. Yeah, yeah, it'll be like we're gal pals, ya know, like at a restraunt. Oh, it'll be fun, c'mon.
Speaking of Christmas, umm since Monica and I are starting a new business and have like no money, umm, this year maybe we could do secret Santa, and then we each only buy one gift. And-and there's the added mystery of who gets who.
No! Think about it okay? This isn't even my regular job! Okay? And my first day on the job, you're my first call! And-and somebody else might've hung up on you, but I wouldn't do that because I know about this stuff. My mom killed herself.
You got problems because of you! Not your name! All right, this has got to stop! Chandler is a great name! In fact-yes, I'm, I'm sorry. I know you really wanted me to name the baby Joey, but eh, so, I'm-I'm, I'm gonna, I'm gonna name the baby Chandler.
Yeah, okay, I've-I've been dating both of you, and it's been really horrible. 'Cause y'know it's been a lot of fun, for me. Umm, but I-I like you both, and I, and I didn't know how to chose, so... I'm sorry, I'm just, I'm terrible, I'm a terrible person. I'm terrible.
Well, it was just, it was all so crazy, you know. I mean, Chandler was in the closet, counting to 10, and he was up to 7 and I hadn't found a place to hide yet. I-I-I meant to tell you, and I wrote it all down on my hand. See, all of it.
Well, but thats what he was for me. And she you know, kind of stole him away, and then... broke his heart... and then he wouldnt even talk to me any more. Because he said he didnt wanna be around... anything that looked like either one of us.
Well, I've been reading up and for your information, minks are not very nice. Okay, I admit it! I love this coat! Okay, I-it's the best thing I've ever had wrapped around me, including Phil Huntley! Remember Phil Huntley? He was fine!
This is fashion?! Okay, so to you, death is fashion?! That's really funny. Here's Phoebe umm, sporting uh, y'know, cutting edge hairy carcass from y'know, the steal traps of wintry Russia. I mean, you really thing this looks good? 'Cause I do.
Yeah. 'Hello. Oh my God, I totally forgot! Well can't someone else do it. But, I have company. Yeah, no look, that's all right I'll come in.' Um, Frank, I'm really sorry but I have to go to work. It's-it's one of my regulars and he's insisting that I do 'um.
No. This whole like playing-for-money thing is so not good for me. You know, I don't know, when I sang "Su-Su-Suicide", I got a dollar seventy-five. But then, "Smelly Cat", I got 25 cents and a condom. So you know, now I just feel really bad for Smelly Cat.
I can't. I can't. She dumped me, I mean I totally trusted her and then one day it was 'Okay, bye Pheebs' gone. Y'know what the saddest part is, when we were playing together, that was like the most fun I've ever had in like all my lives.
Yeah, it's weird. I can't help it though he's so sweet, he's like this little puppy dog, y'know? But like a really tough one that shots bad guys. Ohh, I just love beginning parts of relationships, y'know?! You just like can't keep your hands off each other.
Yeah, and I'm so, so sorry, Ross, I'm sorry, but, you know, if you think about it, it's kinda neat. I mean, well, it's just that I I've always felt kinda like an outsider, you know, the rest of you have these connections that go way back and, you know, now, you and I have... have a great one!
Okay, 'cause right after my mom killed herself, I was just in this really bad place, y'know personally. So, I just thought that it'd make me feel better if I wrote to Sesame Street, 'cause they were so nice when I was a little kid! No one ever wrote back.
Okay. You know how people need transportation, but they also need massages to help them relax so I just figured we could combine the two, okay, I give the massages and Frank drives! I can fix up the van, bolt the table in the back, and you know what I've got?
That's right, exactly. All right, it's a good bye kiss, that's good. Bye-bye. Okay, no, the important thing is that you see what I'm saying, y'know, just y'know, this is clearly wrong. Okay, I've decided I'm gonna let this happen! Okay, can I just get my purse? Okay, all right, good. .
Well, I'm not sure. I mean, I guess until she y'know, gets used to the fact that there's y'know, a new mom. Y'know, I think she's worried that y'know, she's gonna, she's gonna be replaced. Well, that's not gonna happen is it? Noo. Okay, I have to return a call in the other room.
No, look, I told you that I didn't want you to try and sell it, and you just, you big fat did it anyway. God, y'know what, I think five years ago I probably would've done anything to play with you but, I can do it by myself. And if I can't trust you then just forget it.
Yeah, right! See, he gave up something, but then he got those magic beans. And then he woke up, and there was this, this big plant outside his window, full of possibilities and stuff.. And he lived in a village, and you live in the Village..
Okay, so maybe you don't get her a ring. Maybe you-maybe you do something different. Y'know? Maybe you get her an engagement bracelet, y'know? Or an engagement tiara? Or-ooh! An engagement Revolutionary War musket! (Picks one up from the display in the corner.
No, I'm really okay with this. Y'know why? 'Cause look at them, and I made that, so... I know it's gonna be like a million times harder to give up a baby but, oh my God, it's gonna feel like a million times better, right? I wanna do this. I wanna carry your baby.
No. wh - get off your sister! Oh my god, what are we gonna do? We have 7 rats. So what if each of them has 7 rats? And then each of those have 7 rats? That's like ... That's math I can't even do! What are we gonna do?
No, 'cause she didn't tell me I was gonna die until the very end of the session, and I was not gonna waste a whole another hour there! I mean I've only got a week left, y'know? I've really gotta start living now! , leans back, and starts reading.)
Well okay, let this be a lesson to all of you, all right. Once you, once you betray me, I become like the ice woman, y'know. Very cold, hard, unyielding, y'know nothing, nothing can penetrate this icy exterior. Can I have a tissue, please?
Ok, um, we haven't known each other for that long a time, and, um, there are three things that you should know about me. One, my friends are the most important thing in my life, two, I never lie, and three, I make the best oatmeal raisin cookies in the world.
Yeah, so I said, "OK, relax please," y'know, I mean, sex can be just about two people right there in the moment, y'know, it's, if he wants to see me again he can call and if not, that's fine too. So after a looooot of talking. . . I convinced him.
OK. Smelly cat, smell-ly cat, what are they feeding you? Smelly cat OK, sorry. I'm just, I'm just not getting that everyone um, gets how smelly this cat acually is. I just think that maybe if we could talk about this, 'cause I need to feel that you really care about the cat.
What, what's about to happen? I've never seen this part before. Hey, Travis, watcha doin' with that gun? Oh no, no no Travis, put down the gun. No no no no, he he's your buddy, he's your Yeller, no, no no, the end, THE END.
All right, I will. No, I will. But umm, y'know just remember that it's still really early, okay so, if it says that I'm not pregnant, that doesn't mean that I'm not gonna get pregnant, okay and, and just please, just so I don't go completely nuts, just try not put all your hopes on this.
Yeah, but then Jacques Cousteau came and he kicked his ass for betraying me! It was soo cool! Then, he took me diving and he introduced me to his pet seahorse, who, by the way, was totally coming on to me, and please, that is not gonna happen.
Hang on! Hang on! Hang on! Go!! Who's this? Oh okay, you're gonna like working for me. What's your name? What kind of name is Brendy? I... Whatever... Stop talking! All right, from now on your name is Joan. You can pick your own last name.
Yeah. Oh, OOOH, yeah, you know, did you notice how he always starts his stories with, um, OK, 'I was soooo wasted,' or, 'Oh, we were soooo bombed,' or, ummm, ooh, ooh, 'So I wake up, and I'm in this dumpster in Connecticut.'
Well, so what I like him! Do I make fun of the people you've dated? Tag, Janice, Mona? No, because friends don't do that. But, do you want my opinion? Do you want it? 'Cause in my opinion, your collective dating record reads like the who's who of human crap.
Well, 'cause, I mean, what if, what if he's not this great dad guy? I mean, what if, what if he's just still the dirtbag who ran out on my mom and us? You know what? I've already lost a fake dad this week and I don't think I'm ready to lose a real one.
Ooh, if you take the northern route there's a man in Illinois with a beard of bees. {Okay, I must protest this, I've lived in Illinois all my life and know of no man with a beard of bees! Wisconsin, on the other hand, might be a different story.}
Ohh that's so sweet! Oh! Hang on! Hang onnnnnn!!! Go!! No! No-no! I said sell when it hits 50! 5-0, it's a number! It comes after 4-9!! No, it's okay. It's okay, you're allowed one mistake. Just kidding, you are of course fired.
Here you go. You know what, I just have one more question, um, if you had figured this out sooner and um, I had been around, do you think that I would have been the one who. . . no, um, I'm sorry, don't tell me, I don't th ink either answer would make me feel better.
Well, you promised me a fun road trip! We've been on the road six hours and you've been asleep for five and a half! We are switching at the next rest stop and you are going to drive all the way back! That will be your punishment, you greedy sleeper!
Uh, only if you have the hiccups too. Yeah, the pictures are for you, the water and the chocolate is for me. I just didn't feel like getting up. Okay, I'm gonna show you a picture of Ross. Okay? And you're going to remember all of the bad things about him. All right? Really focus on his flaws.
Oh, okay that explains it. I got a call at two in the morning, but all I could hear was, like, this high squeaky sound, so I thought okay its like a mouse or a opossum. But then I realized where would a mouse or a opossum get the money to make the phone call.
Oh my God! Dizziness, nervousness, drowsiness, facial swelling, nausea, headache-Headache. Vomiting, stomach bleeding, liver damage! Now okay, I don't recall any of this coming up when you gave me these little death capsules! Oh I'm sorry, extra strength death capsules!
Hey, hey, ok, all right, that's it! Get in here. Come on. My god, you guys, I don't believe you. There are children coming into the world in this very building and your negative fighting noises are not the first thing they should be hearing. So just stop all the yelling, just stop it!
Today we're gonna start with some songs about barnyard animals. Oh, the cow in the meadow goes moo, Oh, the cow in the meadow goes moo. Then the farmer hits him on the head and grinds him up, And that's how we get hamburgers. Nooowww, chickens!
Okay, first I'm not crazy. And second, say it don't spray it. Anyway his name is Malcom, and he wasn't following me, I mean he was, but 'cause he thought I was Ursula, ick. And, that's why, that's why he couldn't just come up and talk to me. 'Cause of the restraining order.
'Annie! Hi. Listen we got a problem with Joey Tribbiani, apparently he missed his audition. Who did you speak to in my office? Estelle, no, I don't know what I'm going to do with her. No. All right, so your husband leaves and burns down the apartment, the world does not stop.'
Yeah, from now on everyone you lurk, I'm gonna lurk first! You move on to someone else, I'm gonna be one step ahead of you, every single time! And then I'll be on your ass every hour of every day 'til Monday, because that's when I go home. When do you leave?
Now I know that they said that the umm, the hair straightener started the fire but I think I'm partly at fault. You see, I didn't, I didn't tell you but umm, but I-I had recently refilled the tissues and so y'know let's just face it, that's just kindling! So I think it's better that I stay at Joey's.
Yeah, I dreamt that he saved me from a burning building and he was so brave and so strong! And it's making me look at him totally differently. Y'know, I mean he used to be just, y'know "Jack Geller Monica and Ross's dad" and now he's he's "Jack Geller, dream hunk."
Oh, yeah! Okay! Great! Go, man, go put on your shoes, and, and march out there and meet her! Oh, wait, no, no you have to take a shower, 'cause, eww. No, you know what you have to answer her, answer her first. No, no, you know what make some coffee 'cause its too much.
Yeah, but there's a two-year wait. And then what if you get engaged in two years and then you got to wait another two years for this place. That's four years. Chandler's not gonna wait that long. He's gonna find somebody else, y'know? Someone, someone who did put their name on the list.
Well, Frank has to quit college because his super fertile sister is having three babies! I need to make a lot of money really fast, and I had an idea that I want to talk to you about, 'cause you work for a big company. Okay, insider trading, what information is there that you can give me.
I cannot believe I can't find a selfless good deed! Y'know that old guy that lives next to me? Well, I snuck over there and-and raked up all the leaves on his front stoop. But he caught me and force-fed me cider and cookies. Then I felt wonderful. That old jackass!
Well, we didn't have a lot of money. But the girl across the street had the best bike! It was pink and it had rainbow colored tassels hanging off the handle grips, and-and-and a bell and this big, white wicker basket with those plastic daisies stuck on.
Hi. Listen, I'm sorry about that whole thing with Roger. It really wasn't right, and I, and I want to make it up to you, so umm, I brought you something that I think you'll really enjoy. Now, this is just a loan. Okay? I'm gonna, I'm gonna want him back. So... I'm gonna go now. I'm sorry, I thought I could do it and I can't!
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!! Hey!!! Look what you're doing to Chandler!! Yeah, look, we know this is really, really hard for you guys. Okay? You don't, all right you don't have to love each other, okay? You don't, you don't even have to like each other much right now. But please, you have to figure out a way to be around each other.
No. No, I won't. But I should tell you this, this exact same thing happened to my roommate Denise. She moved in with a guy who was secretly married to her and he said he didn't love her, but he really did, and it just blew up! And that's how she ended up living with me! Okay, that's a lie.
Yeah, she came all the way back from Ross' building. Oh, the things she must have seen! And then she climbed up the fire escape and she tapped on the window with her teeny little paw and then we ran to let her in... I went to far, didn't I? When should I have stopped?
Look Eric, turn around. Look, I like you, but it shouldn't be this hard. Y'know? This is our first date y'know? First dates are supposed to be about excitement and electricity and 'Ooh, he just touched my hand, did he mean to touch my hand?' and y'know first kisses and......second kisses.
No, I don't think this was your shot. I mean, I don't even think you just get one shot. I really believe big things are gonna happen for you, I do! You've gotta just keep thinking about the day that some kid is gonna run up to his friends and go 'I got the part! I got the part! I'm gonna be Joey Tribbiani's ass!'.
"Crazy underwear, creepin' up my butt. Crazy underwear, always in a rut. Crazy under--wear..." Oh No! What is he doing here? All right, just keep playing, just keep playing. You'll get through this; you'll be fine. Okay, thank you. And, as always no one talk to me after the show.
Okay, baseball. Rick, playing baseball. Okay, slides into second, maybe even his pants come down a little... Oh no-wait no, no! No! Okay, all right, sandwiches, sandwiches. Umm, okay, on a plate, maybe Rick's pants come down a little. No! No! Okay, Chandler! Okay Chandler, ooh, that's working.
Shhh! I'm on a call! Umm well yeah, you can pick it up tonight, say 8:30? At-at my apartment. It's umm, it's umm 5 Morton Street, Apartment 14, umm and then maybe y'know after we can grab a bite to eat or whatever. Okay, well okay I'll see you then. Bye.
It only takes two heart attacks to finally make you see.../One of them won't do it, but the second one will set you free.../Tell all your hate and anger, it's time to say good-bye.../And that is just what I will do, soon as those bastards I work for die!/La, la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la......
Its mostly just dumb sister stuff, you know, I mean, like, everyone always thought of her as the pretty one, you know... Oh, oh, she was the first one to start walking, even though I did it... later that same day. But, to my parents, by then it was like "yeah, right, well what else is new?"
Whoa!! He is soo unreasonable! God, although I think I understand what he means. Oh my God, this is like 60 Minutes, okay, when, when, at first you're really mad at that pharmaceutical company for making the drug and then y'know you just feel bad for the people because they needed to make their hair grow.
you know maybe this is a wake up call, about your whole dating attitude. Your in your thirty's and you've never had a serious relationship and you have never been in a long term relationship, here you go from woman to woman, meaningless experience to meaningless experience never even worrying that it doesn't tern into anything serious.
Well look, you don't really like the one from uptown and you're too exhausted from dating the one up in Poughkeepsie, so I say you just end them both. Okay? You take a train up to Poughkeepsie and break up with her, and on your way back you break up with uptown. And then by the time you get home tonight, you're done!
well there is no Vicrum, Ross made him up because I never really have been in a long-term relationship, I've never lived with a guy, and I've never even celebrated an anniversary so. if that's too weird for you and you wanna leave I totally understand. In fact I'll close my eye's make it less awkward You kissed me.
You just abandoned your whole belief system. I mean, before, I didn't agree with you, but at least I respected you. How, how, how are you going to go into work tomorrow? How, how are you going to face the other science guys? How, how are you going to face yourself? Oh! That was fun. So who's hungry?
'Okay, go ahead.' Um, hi Annie. Fantastic! You got it. Oh, okay, um, 'Will he work for scale?' you ask me. Well, I don't know about that, except that I do and he will. Great, oh you are such a sweetheart. I would love to have lunch with you, how about we have lunch next.... Op, went through a tunnel.
'Dear Ms. Buffay. Thank you for calling attention to our error. We have credited your account with five hundred dollars. We're sorry for the inconvenience, and hope you'll accept this- -football phone as our free gift.' Do you believe this?! Now I have a thousand dollars, and a football phone!
No, huh uh, I'm sorry, no. No, I'm not some like sloppy second, charity band. You know what, there are thousands of places in this city where people would be happy to pay to hear me play. When I play, I play for me, I don't need your charity. Thank you! La la la la la la la....
Wait, you know what, I got a little story. When I was in Junior High School I went through this period where I thought I was a witch. And there was this guidance counselor who said something to me, that I think will help you a lot. He said okay, 'you're not a witch you're just an average student.' See what I'm saying?
No Dr. Skeptismo! I'm sure. First of all, okay, there's the feeling. Okay, and for another, how about the fact that she went into my guitar case which is lined with orange felt. My Mother's favourite fish is Orange Roughy... Cats....like....fish! Hi, Mommy. Oh, I haven't seen this smile in 17 years!
Pay the caterer! Look, I've had a lot of jobs, okay, and there are some people who just always try to get out of paying. It's either, you know, "that massage wasn't long enough, or, "I don't recognize any of those songs," or, you know, "these sombreros aren't big enough. Bad little white girl!"
Yeah, oh I'm sorry, it must be really hard to hear! I tell ya, it's a lot easier having three babies play Bringing in the Noise, Bringing in da Funk on your bladder! I'm so sick of being pregnant! The only happiness I get is from a cup of coffee, which of course is decaf, 'cause-Oh! I'm pregnant!
Okay, umm, if a kid gets straight A's, his parents would say, "Yeah, he pulled a Monica." Y'know? Or a fireman saves a baby, and they go, "Yeah I know, he pulled a Monica." Or someone hits a homerun and the announcer says, "Yeah, that one's outta here." Though some things don't change.
Probably? Yeah, I don't like that word. Kind of what 'probably' really means. Yeah, uh-huh. Yeah, oh, "Your mom probably won't kill herself," y'know? I'm sorry, but I'm not hanging all my hopes of Rachel and I living together on-on "Probably!" Y'know? You gotta take care of yourselves! In this world history teaches us nothing!
Okay, Lesson One: Chords. Now, I Don'T Know The Actual Names Of The Chords But Umm, I-I-I Made Up Names For The Way My Hand Looks While I'M Doing Them. So then, this is Bear Claw. Okay, umm, Turkey Leg and Old Lady.
Umm, okay, okay, look. I took this picture from your fridge. Okay, because I know that this is my Father. Yeah, this is Frank Buffay and you are standing right there next to him. Now, look I deserve to know where I came from. All right? So if you can help me find my Father then you should! Otherwise, you're just mean! So, just tell me the truth!
No he won't. And that's not even the point! Monica, I made a whole speech about you do not cancel plans with friends! And now y'know what? Just because, potentially, the love of my life comes back from Russia just for one night, I-I should change my beliefs?! I should change beliefs! No! No! No, if I don't have my principles, I don't have anything!
No, no, it's not your fault. You know it's partly my fault, 'cause I made you quit cold turkey. Sorry, no. Okay, well, I mean, I can't date you anymore, 'cause your, you know Wow! But um, but I will definitely, definitely help you get over my sister. Okay, stalk me for a while. Huh? Yeah, and, and, and, I'll be like an Ursula patch.
He said that, um, he understands how sex can be like, a very emotional thing for a woman and he was just afraid that I was gonna get all, y'know, like, 'ohh, is he gonna call me the next day' and, y'know, 'where is this going' and, ya know, blah-la-la-la-la. So he said he wanted to hold off until he was prepared to be really serious.
Before I start, I just wanna say that umm, I have a cold, so if I sneeze in the middle of song, it's not on purpose. Oh, except the last verse of Pepper People. Smelly cat, smelly cat. What are they feeding you? This chick sounds good. Smelly cat, smelly-- Hey Gunther, be a good little boy and bring me a whiskey.
Oh yes, yes, yes you can. Just say, um, 'Phoebe, my work is my life and that's what I have to do right now'. And I say 'your work?! Your work?! How can you say that?!'. And then you say, um, 'it's tearing me apart, but I have no choice. Can't you understand that?'. And I say 'no! No! I can't understand that!'.
Excuse me. Excuse me! Thanks. Um, clearly this is a very, very hard time for you. Um, but, um, we provided a service, and we deserve to be paid because you ate that service, and, um, we are not leaving here until we're paid every penny. 'Cause you know what, lady? We're part time caterers, and we have no place else to go.
Ok, Ben, this is the part where Ernie buries Bert in the sand and can't find him. Now, I've looked ahead on the tape and he does find him again. But, ok, before that happens, there's some pretty rough goin' for a while but I think we can handle it. And, there's just the alphabet but we know that ends well so. Ok, here we go.
yeah I've nothing to be ashamed of ok so I haven't been in a relationship that lasted longer then a month. Ok I haven't had a real boyfriend you know if he can't handle that he can leave. which he will and that's ok. so I'll just be alone forever you know alright I'll be. it'll be fine. it'll be fine. I'll go walking tours with widows and lesbians. Oh.
That's okay Rachel. I'm not judging you; that's just who you are. Me. I'm more free y'know? I run like I did when I was a kid, cause that's the only way it's fun. Y'know, I mean didn't you ever run so fast you thought your legs were gonna fall off? Y'know, like when you were like running towards the swings or running away from Satan? The neighbor's dog.
Um, yeah. Look, I mean, Im not saying shes like evil or anything. She just, you know, shes always breaking my stuff. When I was eight, and I wouldnt let her have my Judy Jetson thermos, so she threw it under the bus. And then, oh, and then there was Randy Brown, who was like... Have you ever had a boyfriend who was like your best friend?
"Went to the store, sat on Santa's lap./Asked him to bring my friends all kind of crap./Said all you need is to write them a song./They haven't heard it, so don't try and sing along./No, don't sing along./Monica, Moncia, have a happy Chanukah./Saw Santa Clause, he said hello to Ross./And plese tell Joey, Christmas will be snowy!/And Rachel and Chandler, have err-umm-glander!!"/Happy holidays, everybody!
You're welcome. I remember when I first came to this city. I was fourteen. My mom had just killed herself and my step-dad was back in prison, and I got here, and I didn't know anybody. And I ended up living with this albino guy who was, like, cleaning windshields outside port authority, and then he killed himself, and then I found aromatherapy. So believe me, I know exactly how you feel.
Okay. Umm, before we get started, I just wanna say for the record that I love Ross, I think he's such a great guy. Here. Okay, now, close your eyes. And imagine that you're with Ross okay and imagine that you're kissing him. And you're-you're running your hands all over his body. And then you run your hands through his hair, but eew-oh gross it's some kind of grease, it's-uck! Hah?
Yeah, it's just so strange. I mean, she probably woke up today and thought, "ok, I'll have some breakfast, and then I'll take a little walk, and then I'll have my massage." Little did she know God was thinking, "Ok, but that's it." Oh, but the weirdest thing was, ok, I was cleansing her aura when she died, and when the spirit left her body, I don't think it went very far.
Oh, for god's sake, Judy, pick up the sock! Pick up the sock! Pick up the sock! I'm sorry, was that rude? Di-did my, my li-little outburst blunt the hideousness that is this evening? Look, I know, you all have a lot going on, but all I wanted to do was have dinner with my friends on my birthday. And you are all so late and you didn't even have the courtesy to call. Well, it's too late now.
Hm, I mean maybe no-one ever really goes. Ever since my mom died, every now and then, I get the feeling that she's like right here, y'know? Oh! And Debbie, my best friend from junior high- got struck by lightning on a miniature golf course- I always get this really strong Debbie vibe whenever I use one of those little yellow pencils, y'know? ...I miss her.
She is lying! And I bet I can prove it. Excuse me. Okay. Okay. Yeah-Not a prayer chain, but what looks like a detailed drawing of a bank floor plan. Okay, here's the nametag from the restaurant where she works as a waitress! Not a teacher, a waitress. All right, here's her driver license, this oughta be good, she always lies about this. How old did she say she was?
I just think that this was a really bad sign, ya know. I mean, like the beast at the threshold, you know. It's just like, I have no family left, ya know. I mean except for my grandmother, you know, but let's face it, she's not gonna be around forever, despite what she says. And I have a sister who I've barely spoken to since we like shared a womb. I don't know, this is my real father and I just, I want things to be like just right.
Monica slow down! Ok? I'm just excited to be living with him. You know I mean, I don't know, Can I see someday being married to Mike? Sure! Yeah. Y'know..I can picture myself walking down the aisle in a wedding dress that highlights my breasts in an obvious yet classy way. But do I want that house in Connecticut...you know..near the good schools where Mike and I can send Sophie and Mike Junior.. Oh my god I do.
There was a girl, we'll call her Betty, and a guy let's call him Neil. Now I can't stress this point too strongly, this story isn't real. Now our Neil must decide, who will be the girl that he casts aside. Will Betty be the one who he loves truly? Or will it be the one who we'll call Ju...Loolie? He must decide, he must decide, even though I made him up, he must decide!
OK, um, I'm gonna play, um, some songs about grandparents, OK. Now, grandma's a person who everyone likes, she bought you a train and a bright, shiny bike. But lately she hasn't been coming to dinner, And last time you saw her she looked so much thinner. Now, your mom and your dad said she moved to Peru, but the truth is she died and some day you will too. La-la-la la la-la-la la la-la-la la...
I mean, well, 'cause when I was growing up, you know my dad left, and my mother died, and my stepfather went to jail, so I barely had enough pieces of parents to make one whole one. And here's this little baby who has like three whole parents who care about it so much that they're fighting over who gets to love it the most. And it's not even born yet. It's just, it's just the luckiest baby in the whole world. I'm sorry, you were fighting.
Ok, Ross, could you just open your mind like this much, ok? Wasn't there a time when the brightest minds in the world believed that the world was flat? And, up until like what, 50 years ago, you all thought the atom was the smallest thing, until you split it open, and this like, whole mess of crap came out. Now, are you telling me that you are so unbelievably arrogant that you can't admit that there's a teeny tiny possibility that you could be wrong about this?
Hello, tiny embryos. Well, I'm-I'm Phoebe Buffay, hi! I'm-I'm-I'm hoping to be your uterus for the next nine months. You should know, that we're doing this for Frank and Alice, who you know, you've been there! Umm, y'know they want you so much, so when you guys get in there, really grab on. Okay, and-and I promise that I'll keep you safe and warm until you're ready to have them take you home, so... Oh! And also, umm next time you see me, I'm screaming, don't worry, that's what's supposed to happen.
Well I have a video, you have to pay attention. No this, this voice woman, she's so talented but, according to the producer people, they said she doesn't have like the right look or something, ya know. I mean, it's like, she's like one of those an imals at the pound who like nobody wants 'cause they're not pretty enough or you know. Like, like some old dog who's just kind of like stinky and. Huuuuh, oh my God, she's smelly cat. Oh, oh that song has so many levels.
So, here you are. It seems like yesterday I was talking to you in that little petri dish. Everyone said labor was the hardest thing I'd ever have to do, but they were wrong this is. Oh, I had the most fun with you guys! I wish I could take you home and see you everyday. Okay, I'll settle for being your favorite Aunt. I know Alice's sister has a pool, but you lived in me. Okay, so we're cool. Yeah, we're gonna be great. Little high fives! Ahh! Ahh! Ahh! Well, if you're gonna cry.
So here is a, a very special holiday song that I wrote for some very important people to me. "Went to the store, sat on Santa's lap. Asked him to bring my friends all kinds of crap. Said all you need is to write them a song. Now, you haven't heard it yet, so don't try to sing along. No, don't sing along. Monica, Moncia, have a happy Hanukkah. Saw Santa Claus, he said hello to Ross. And please tell Joey, Christmas will be snowy! And Rachel and Chandler, have err-umm-glander!!" Happy holidays, everybody!
Uhm... Okay, well, allright, uhm... Originally I'm from upstate, but uhm... then my mom killed herself and my stepdad went to prison, so... I just moved to the city where uhm... I actually lived in a burned out Buick LeSabre for a while... which was okay, that was okay, until uhm... I got hepatitis, you know, 'cause this pimp spit in my mouth and... but I... I got over it and uhm... anyway, now I'm uhm... a freelance massage therapist, uhm... which, you know, isn't always steady money but at least I don't pay taxes, huh... So... where does everyone summer?
Ok, so this is pretty much what's happened so far. Ross was in love with Rachel since, you know, forever, but every time he tried to tell her, something kind of got in the way, like cats, and Italian guys. Finally Chandler was like "forget about her" but when Ross was in China on his dig, Chandler let it slip that Ross was in love with Rachel. She was like, "Oh my god." So she went to the airport to meet him when he came back, but what she didn't know was, that Ross was getting off the plane with another woman. Uh-Oh! So, that's pretty much everything you need to know. But, enough about us. So, how've you been?
Me taking care of you is no problem, huh? You guys feel safe. Right? Okay, I'm gonna take that spit bubble as, "Yeah, I do!" Okay, after I get rid of this dirty diaper Leslie, I'll set you up with a clean one. Okay, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you. I just have to clean that up. Okay? 'Cause let's face it, we're at Monica's. I broke it. All right. Well, that's just the way that goes. Okay, good. Why are there only two of you? Where is Leslie? Well, you can't answer. Leslie? Where are you Leslie? Leslie, now would be a good time for your first words! Well, look at you! Hey! You are a little bit mischievous! My gosh! Oh, you're a lot mischievous! Well, it'll dry. Okay, you sit with your brother and sister now-who aren't there!
All right, everyone calm down! Everyone calm down! I have something that I would like to say! Who here likes Ross? Of course you don't like him! He-he didn't give you any money, he raised his own hand when I asked, "Who hear likes Ross," and he's wearing two nametags! I-I'll be honest with you guys, when I first met Ross I didn't like him at all! But then once I got to know him I saw that he's really sweet and caring and very generous. I mean, all I'm saying is don't judge Ross before you get to know him all right? I mean, I like all you guys now, but when I first meet you y'know Kurt, I thought, y'know abrasive drunk, umm Lola, mind numbingly stupid! And okay, you guys Gold-digger, cradle robbing perv! So, I think you all know what I mean.
