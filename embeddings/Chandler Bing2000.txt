Look, you have done enough! Okay? You have to stop this now.
Wait a minute, is she going for spring vacation or is she going for spring break?
What?
Hi!
Okay, then get the lobster!
Hey.
Okay. Okay. All right. Help! Am I a Mark, or a John?
I like her.
Okay, well it this bed isn't new, how come there is plastic on the mattress?
Nothing, except tell you, uh, I think it's wonderful how much energy you have.
It doesn't matter. I just don't want to be one of those guys that's in his office until twelve o'clock at night worrying about the WENUS.
You made pottery?
What are we gonna do?
Really?
Okay.
I hope she throws up on you.
You burn your mouth?
Well, I then guess I'm going to Yemen! I'm going to Yemen! When we get to Yemen, can I stay with you?
Hey, you feelin' better?
Okay, we have to talk. I'm just getting out of a very serious relationship...
C'mon, I'll show you to my room. ...That sounds so weird when it's not followed by "No thanks, it's late."
Scotch on the rocks, with a twist, on a coaster? Ha-ha, Monica! Monica!
Really?!
You don't think I've tried? You think I like having 50 dollars taken out of my bank account every month? No, they make you go all the way down there! Then they use all of these phrases and peppiness to try and confuse you! Then they bring out Maria.
Look, I may have jumped the gun here. Um, I just got out of a relationship and I'm not really in a, in a commitment kind of place.
What?
Our minister...
Is that a problem?
Boy did we make friends with the wrong sister!
So uhh, how's the palace?
Wha- wh- why, why, why does he suspect that?
Hey.
Maybe it's the sound of Ross climbing into my brain and stealing my thoughts.
Hey Joe.
Du-ude!
Hey.
Wow! Look at them run.
Hey.
Hey.
I got it! Scotch... tape.
Come on, pick up, pick up! Hello? Transit Authority? Yes, hello. I'm doing research for a book, and I was wondering what someone might do if they left a baby on a city bus. Yes I do realize that would be a very stupid charact er.
No. No, I just think that maybe I-I'd heard it somewhere before.
But you found the keys to his clothes?
No, no he went for a walk.
That's not true! I wanted to wear my bathrobe and eat peanut clusters all day. I wanted to start drinking in the morning. Don't say that I don't have goals!
Of course I am. I reject anyone who's crazy enough to actually go out with me, and then I bitch about the fact that there aren't any great women out there.
I'm not in a meeting. I'm right... Whoops.
Eeeshk.
Hi, um, I'm account number 7143457. And, uh, I don't know if you got any of that, but I would really like a copy of the tape.
Okay before we start the celebration, Monica has to go put on her party dress.
I don't believe it. The most romantic night of my life and I'm runner up.
It's OK. It's OK. I was always rooting for you two kids to get together.
NO! No, I'll take that for ya.
Oh man!
I used to have that bumper sticker.
Why wouldn't they be happy?
...And what did you bring?
Oh-hey-hey-hey! There you are!
Well, I don't know what Big Leon told ya but it's an even thousand if you want me for the whole night. What is this for?
Volleyball.
All right, y'know what? Forget it, all of you forget it! You've ruined it! Go home! You've ruined it! You've ruined it!
Oh hey, it's, it's terriffic. I mean it's a regular space... fest.
Oh, I'm Ross. I'm Ross. I'm too good for the Hut; I'm too good for the Hut.
"So how does it feel knowing you're about to die?"
Are you serious?
Okay. Joey, trade lives with me!
Oh my God, introduce us!
Or... Dick.
Would you come on! Come on! Thank you.
You just said... Of course you're my best friend. Would you please tell Rachel though?
All right, fine! Fine! Why don't you pull over? I'll get out right now!
God, it's great to catch up! I can't believe how long it's been!
No, look, that's it, it's over, I want you out, I want you out of the apartment now.
I have the lung capacity of a two year old.
You are totally and completely 100% forgiven.
Why not?
Okay, you are new!
Wow! You look just like your son Mrs. Tribbiani!
Oh yes!
What?!
All right.
They do?
Actually, can I get some hot water with a little lemon? I think I strained my voice screaming in there. Does it have to be so loud?
You're right, and I'm sorry! This means a lot to me! I want you to be my friend again! I swear, I won't say another word tonight.
What?
I'm gonna grab you some tissue.
Oh, do you not want to?
Yes, and we'd appreciate it if no one told him yet.
Our baby.
And I just realized I can sleep with my eyes open.
Uh-huh.
Oh really? Uh, Monica said she had a date at 9:00.
I don't know. I can't tell, what ever it was went back in too quickly.
Listen, I have to, uh, um, I have to, I have to confess something.
No, it's not that, I just don't want to be stuck here all night with your fat sister.
And monkeys can't write out prescriptions.
Oh, why not. Was I doing anything particularly... saucy?
What?!
So, when I woke up this morning, he'd stolen all the insoles out of my shoes.
I know, that, that's why I don't want to go tonight, I'm afraid I'm going to say something stupid.
Let me see this guy. W-H-Wow! Don't show this to Monica! And don't tell her about the W-H-Wow!
Look forget it okay? I don't want to go. I don't want to see him. I don't wanna.
Janice, I'm sorry but umm, you can't stay here tonight.
Well, what is it?
Did she freak out?
Oh yea yea, absolutely.
Ahh, do you have any coconut flavoured deities?
I said art lover.
Yeah, I'm not in that.
Uh, no, I got to see Donald Trump waiting for an elevator.
Okay! Now you stay out here, and you think about what you did!!
Feelings, such strong feelings.
That's ok.
Make sure you put all that stuff back in the closet, okay?
Okay.
It was at the front door. When I got home. Somebody sent it to us.
Gunther, can I get another cup of coffee, please? So uh, what do you do when you're not working here?
Well you don't have to sound so surprised.
God, I love these fingers...
Hhhiiii.
Joey, Joey. Hey, some girl just walked up to me and said, 'I want you Dennis,' and stuck her tounge down my throat. I love this party.
Nice try.
Things sure have changed here on Waltons mountain.
Yeah, I'm cool. Casual.
Whoa!
No. No. We're not gonna do that, y'know why? Because its not an even trade.
It's my joke.
Well, it's sharp, it's metal, I think I can do some, you know, serious damage with it.
Okay.
Oh, uh.. I want her to think I might be in a restaurant.. y'know? I might have some kind of life, like I haven't been sitting around here honing for the past few hours.
But are you sure you can do this?
Ba dum bumb cheshhh!
98. 99. 100. Okay, go!
Right.
Okay but what about y'know my pinchable butt and my bulging biceps-She knows!
Rachel got Ross the tuxedo that Val Kilmer wore in Batman. Okay Batman is so much cooler than James Bond!
I'm not Jewish, so...
I'm totally screwed. Okay, they are gonna be hot and heavy on stage every night, and then they're gonna go to their cast parties and he's gonna try to undermine me. Y'know it'll be like, "So where's your boyfriend, what's-his-name, Chester?" And she'll go, "No-no-no, it's Chandler." And he'll go, "Whatever. Ha-ha-ha-ha!"
Hey, yo.
Oh, yeah, easy for you to say, you don't have to walk around sporting some reject from the Mr. T collection.
All right, fine, you know what, we'll both sit in the chair. I'm soooo, comfortable.
Well, I think it all started when you said, "Hey Joey, why don't you be my best man."
Thanks!
Then it's okay!
Oh my God!!
Okay, no problem, just remember to wake us up before you go-go.
I'm still on London time, does that count?
I turned it off. Mother of God, I turned it off!
Oh that makes me feel so warm in my hollow tin chest.
Well you see in Cups, once you get $700, you have to double it.
Well I do, but uh, Eddie makes them this way and, well they're pretty darn good.
Oh-oh, yeah, and did he also say that ah, some of the dialogue was corny and that he actually found it was funny and not sexy?
One more game?
Ooh, I do! I do! I do!
Yes, but for the last time.
Ah, Sliced Bread, a wonderful Lady MacBeth.
Monica! This is the Men's room! Isn't it?
Hey!
I didn't think I was!
Whoa-whoa-whoa! You broke Joey's chair?
Daaahhhh!
Ho-ho, you win! 50 dollars!
Umm, how's it going with you guys?
Not a lot of closet space, but he can just hang his stuff out the window in a bag!
Oh no-no-no-no!
Mrs. Braverman must be out.
Mon, get out here!
Wow, you're, you're right. I have a horrible, horrible name.
Yes it is! From now on, I have no first name.
Ooh, yum!
Okay!
Monica and I are celebrating our ten-month anniversary, we've got reservations at Ja George.
I'm here to see Mary-Angela.
Orange juice.
Okay!
Yay!
Ahhhh!
There's a beautiful woman at eight, nine, ten o'clock!
...spender.
No-no-no-no. Hey!
The mean guys at the coffee house took my hat.
No, I mean, come on, seriously think about it, we get married, we're up at the altar and I'm like this.
Hey listen, come on, Joey is having a problem! A little girl is beating him up.
Yeah-yeah, so big that it actually makes our doors look smaller!
Y'know, I saw a wine cellar downstairs...
I love you so much.
You dove in front of Ross! Ross!
That's nice.
Yes! I love you! I've never loved anybody as much as I love you.
All right look, I think it's time for you to settle down. Y'know? Make a choice, pick a lane.
What?
You know who else picked Rachel? Ross, and you know what else Ross did? He stole my joke. You know what? I'm going to get a joke journal. Y'know? And document the date and time of every single one of my jokes.
I couldn't say that I was naked because she's allowed too see me naked.
Extremely allergic, okay? If I'm anywhere near a dog for more than 5 minutes, my throat will just close up!
You're not gonna die an old maid, maybe an old spinster cook.
Excuse me...
You are a frightening, frightening man.
Yes. Yes.
All right. I will go out and I will try to find something for her, okay?
Your just, your just clearly not familiar with our young persons vernacular. See, when we say dad, we mean buddy. We mean pal.
You built a fort didn't ya?
Yeah, she seemed cool, attractive. I'll do it.
Stop what?!
Oh, yeah.
Look Joe, I know you wanted to do the wedding...
Love your condoms my man.
Oh, great. This is just...
Woooo!!!
Yeah, that's kinda a relief.
Ross! You gotta stop! Okay?! You can't just stare through the peep hole for three hours! You're gonna get peep eye!
I have no idea.
Ginger. I'm talking to Ginger, so....
And, ah, you know, your fooling around with her. And you get all these like, mental images in your brain, you know, like Elle MacPherson, or that girl at the Xerox place....
No it's not. It's small. It's tiny. It's petite. It's wee.
Yeah, I'd love to but I've tried that so many times they won't even let me in the store anymore.
Give him money? It was a joke!
What-what Richard thing?
Smooth.
This, this actually is a...
Well hello!
What've you been up to?
Ross?
Don't you have to be Claymation to say stuff like that?
No, you kidding? The guy's a freak..
Okay listen, just give me anything I can make two of.
I don't know, y'know. What, what, would you do?
I don't think that's what they were talking about Joe!!
I wasn't sure which one Mary-Angela was. Look, I'm sorry okay, I was really drunk, and you all look really similar.
So what are you going to do?
You can say that because she's not your mom.
Oh Mon-Mon-Mon-Mon-look, this is the honeymoon suite. The room expects sex. The room would be disappointed if it didn't get sex. All of the other honeymoon suites would think it was a loser.
Okay, so how bummed were you when the second sister died huh?
Yes, it does bother me! And I think it would bother a lot of people. Rachel, when you were going out with Ross, did it bother you when he flirted with other women?
Well, invisible kids can be that way sometimes.
Why not?
What happened?!!
No, it can mean anything. Like uh, all of the sudden you're jealous because I've become the apartment stud.
F-hah.... flennin....
That's so funny, because I think I just did!
Okay, but now see you're crying!
Dude! Dude!
Yo, paisan! Can I talk to you for a sec? Your tailor is a very bad man!
Yeah!
So y'know, uh, when's he getting back?
Oh!
No, no I just ah, didn't do them. Instead, I ah, hung out with a couple of friends and had a couple of beers so I certainly don't deserve any praise, verbal or otherwise.
Tuna or egg salad? Decide!
If you need money, will you please-please just let me loan you some money?
Well then why can't I see it?
Why her mom?
I don't believe they're brother and sister.
Alright, here's ten.
Well, I'm there too!
See, I told you they don't swim.
Yes?
Before!!
Uh, Magellan? You got 46 states.
It's okay, I got a plan.
Nope, not under here!
Joe?
No you don't! No, no, no, I say you have to give your divorce another chance.
Well it's very unsettling.
We're going to Everest! Okay, it would be nice to leave an ass print on Everest!
There's another carton right over there.
What?
Yes, we're standing out ground...apparently.
How do you know that? How?
Okay, I'll do it!
Yeah! You graduated Magma Ku Laude, right?
Nice camoflauge man, for a minute there I almost didn't see ya.
Okay!!!!!
Can I check out what she did to my room?
You didn't think I used to wear glasses, right?
The doctor.
What about the time difference?
So uh, what's this thing you're auditioning for?
Ahh, you know what? That is....Who wouldn't want you?
Oh no thanks. I don't like any thing from my Scottish heritage.
I don't know. Should we try it?
Beam me up Jesus.
Hi! I'm back. Yeah, that sounds great. Okay. Well, we'll do it then. Okay, bye-bye.
Oh, I'm sorry, so 'we' is?
Isn't Ben in this?
That's correct.
Uhh, 9.
Well, she is going to know that you stole the joke.
Y'know what? It's gonna be okay. Y'know what? She's probably not gonna even want to come.
Hey! Happy birthday.
Hey, that was really good!
What?
I knew it!
You-you do?
Good luck, man. I hope you get it.
Okay.
You know it?
Oh yeah, but don't worry. I don't think anybody's gonna focus on that as long as your wearing that towel dress.
Oh no.
Ahhhh-I'm not going to call you.
Y'know I had a big meal on Monday, y'know. So that's just gonna get me straight through the week.
Your cappucino sir.
What?!
Well okay Jerry, thanks for stopping by.
Y'know sometimes the good ideas are just right in front of you, aren't they?
Okay, well, then, I-I have to go to the bathroom.
Oh.
Well now you have two. Hey, I am good at math.
Nooo.
No!
Oh, I'm sorry, then you're widowed?...Hopefully?
Well, that's pretty much all I'm looking for from these people.
Okay, I thought of the joke two months ago at lunch with Steve.
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!!
Yeah I know, but I was really confused and then I talked to these guys.
Yes.
A woman's
Sure I do. In fact, I think the whole concept of marriage is unnatural. I mean look at pigs. Let's take a second here and look at pigs. Okay pigs don't mate for life. I mean a pig can have like a hundred sexual partners in a lifetime, and that's just an ordinary pig not even a pig that's good at sports!
Unbelievable
Well, it throws my WENUS out of whack.
Are you all right?
Oh-no, y'know with Gandolf we'd be out all night!
All guys that are awake. Then we go to sleep and then all the guys from the other end of the world wake up and behave the exact same way.
And err, he informed me that uh, she took the news rather badly, in fact, he uh, mentioned the word frenzy.
The door hasn't been locked in five years, but okay! Ready?!
I'm over here big guy.
No! That was a lie! See how easy that was?
No, I guess I just never really cried. Y'know? I'm not a crying kind of guy.
Yeah, well, I don't dance at weddings.
Yes, I know, as it happens my room is very very close to the parade route.
All right look, am I serious, okay? Tomorrow at 3:30 I am going down to the courthouse.
Joey! No way. I'm not answering that.
Hey.
Don't think of it as a cigarette. Think of it as the thing that's been missing from your hand. When you're holding it, you feel right. You feel complete.
What's this in my pocket? Why it's Joey's porno movie.
Hey.
Oh, I don't know.
Ok, Janice. Janice. Hey, Janice. Look, there's no way for me to tell you this. At least there's no new way for me to tell you this. I just don't things are gonna work out.
You actually think that something can happen between Emily and Susan?
Yes, but the coffee table doesn't match the...blahebdmsdlkhdyslkd;btyds...Rooosss!!!!
Phoebe knows about us!
What?
Y'know what? There's some nice guys at my office, do you want me to set you up?
Althea?! What are you doing?!
I don't want to look.
Thanks.
Well, you do want all that stuff, right?
Hey, Ben, remember us? Ok, the mole came off.
And Milton Berle has a...
...Quality, right, great.
And I'm cute too.
Hey, you have got to try this cheesecake.
God?
Bladder Control Problem Stop Wife Beating Hemorrhoids? Winner of 3 Tony Awards...
I think it's the dying cat parade.
Yeah, well, you wouldn't think it was cool if you're eleven years old and all your friends are passing around page 79 of 'Mistress Bitch.'
Nothing! It's over! Dammit! This is regularly scheduled programming!
Yes, it is, at Office Max.
I didn't know you were taking a class. That is so cool.
Your tax dollars?
I KNEW IT!!!!
Yeah, he let us drive his Jaguar. Joey for 12 blocks, me for 15.
With Roger? Not just with Roger?! Oh my God!
It's like this, me, no jokes.
I see where you're goin'!
Hey, what did your agent say?
He's right. Nobody's gonna benefit, and you're just gonna hurt her.
Hi.
Welcome home man.
Y'know I was thinking if we had a...a big fight and uh we broke up for a few hours...
Interesting, cause in my dreams, I'm allways surprisingly inadequate.
Morning.
That's so weird, I had such a blast with him the other night.
What???
Hey.
Well, I did not know that.
You hear that! That is her chose, mister I'll let you have her! I win! You suck! I rule all! A mini-wave in celebration of me!!
I was not and oh God, shh!
God that is good TV.
Hey!
You're right.
She answered.
Hey, y'know what you should do? You should take her back to the 1890's, when that phrase was last used.
What?
It's my joke.
Yeah I know, we're losing Ross, Joey said hence...
I made that joke up.
Oh, Danielle! I wasn't expecting the machine... Give me a call when you get a chance. Bye-bye. Oh God!
Oh, I know. This must be so hard. Oh, no. Two women love me. They're both gorgeous and sexy. My wallet's too small for my fifties, and my diamond shoes are too tight.
Your sister Joan is crazy.
No! In his office! How many kisses were there?
I think this is probably why Damone smokes in his cell alone.
No-no all kids are embarrassed by their parents, you'd have to come up with a whole new word for what I went through. When I was in High School, he used to come to all of my swim meets dressed as a different Hollywood starlet. Y'know it's hard enough to be fourteen. You're skinny. You're wearing speedoes-That your mom promised that you would grow into! And you look up into the stands and there's your dad cheering you on dressed as Carmen Miranda. We was wearing a headdress with real fruit that he will later hand out to your friends as a healthy snack!
Listen, Phoebs, this is gonna be OK. Ross, Russ. Russ, Ross.
Couldn't be more out.
Oh. Y'know, that night meant a lot to me too, and it wasn't because I was in a bad place or anything, it just meant a lot to me 'cause, you're really hot! Is that okay?
Then why-why is she going to a play?!
Okay.
Diet soda.
Hey!
Girth? Why, why, why, wh-why, why, why, why would they do this?
Yeah, get out!
It's very, very nice. Well, come here. I'm very were gonna be having all the sex.
I could use the money; it could give me time to write.
It's nice.
There are snow cones! Snow cones! Yuck!
What?
Oh yes! Oh yes!
That was pretty 007.
Phil.
So, what are you gonna do?
Well it's just my entire family was run out of Scotland by...Vikings. Anyway, lots of bad memories.
Sydney Portier? Hehheh.
OK well here, we'll just move the coffee table closer to the couch.
Hey, we haven't been on a second date, she needs to hear me pee?
Okay, I'm gonna go to the bathroom. Will you watch my phone?
Wait a minute, wait. You're telling me this actress person is the only woman you ever wanted who didn't want you back?!
Yeah, didn't he tell ya?
Yes, we don't get married unless there's a sign! Okay, so say uh, say you roll another eight then there's a definite sign that we should get married.
Oh well it's not me, it's my character, Chandy. Yeah the rogue processor who seduces his co-worker's wives for sport and then laughs about it the next day at the water cooler. In fact, I have her panties right there in my drawer.
So, you don't think I'm terminal?
Oh and Ross was like what? A lion tamer?
Okay! You don't think I thought of that?
Central Perk?
That's what's weird? Joey, the man's been captain of a cereal for the last 40 years.
Look you have to realize I don't think of you as a thin, beautiful woman. See this is one of things that I can apologize for later! Look, what I mean is you're Monica! Okay? And I am in love with Monica.
Hey, Rach, can I get...
It's not a big deal. It's, just it's right here, and it's all the time.
Nothing, Monica and I had a stupid fight.
What's wrong?
Clearly I did not start drinking enough at the start of the meal.
Well I just, thought maybe you'd wanna book some time with the best you'd ever had.
Sorry. I'm sorry. Y'know what, we're just gonna throw it.
I think it's winning.
Okay, y'know, we-we're safe right? I mean nothing bad can go down!
Yeah. Either that, or you just turned him on and sent him off to a stripper.
No! Look, I don't cry! It's not a big deal! Okay?!
I'm sorry!
Oh no-no-no, I'm, I'm paddling away!
Oh yeah, that sounds great. Oh, and listen, it's, it's gonna be....
Would you please get some rest!
Oh, don't say that! Don't say that. That's not true. Is it?
Ohhh Oh no, wait a minute, I have no one.
I'm not your garbage man. I'm your mailman.
All right! I found one that fits!
That's great!
Spanish midgets. Spanish midgets wrestling. Julie. Ok, yes, I see how you got there.
Hey! What are you guys doing?
I got something for her. It's a book!
Uhh, Joey's grandmother is right there.
Oh! Right. Umm, maybe that's because I didn't send him an invitation.
Hey!
Yeah, well, I guess they had a fight, and he got drunk....
Oh Maria. You can't say no to her, she's like this lycra spandex covered gym...treat.
Yes!
Ok, now, remember, no trading. You get the pretty one, I get the mess.
Well we could just stay in and cook for ourselves.
Are you all right?!
Hey-hey! I thought Naked Thursday's was just our thing man!
Yes that was mine.
Oh, that's fine! Go with your instincts, go with your instincts.
Dear God! This parachute is a knapsack!
Y'know what else I can't believe? I had to kiss Phoebe and Rachel every time I left a room, I mean it's too bad they didn't see us having sex.
Jeannie, the head of east coast operations Jeannie?
So, I finally catch up to her and she says this relationship is going to fast and we have to slow down.
Ok.
No I'm serious, we should tell each other everything. I do not have any secrets from you.
You-you-you don't wanna give into the fear.
Could we be more white trash?
Hey! Everybody at work loved you last night!
Okay! I was gonna wait 'til uh, it was official y'know? But I got so excited I just had to tell you guys because you're my best friends.
Yeah?
Oh yes!
Okay.
Oh, yeah. Uh, no you can't have my jacket! Because then I would be cold! If you thought that you were going to be cold, you should've brought your own jacket. But uh, other than that, are you okay? Are you okay?
Ow!
Yeah, can I get a 3-piece, some cole slaw, some beans, and a Coke--Diet Coke.
Yeah baby!
Okay. You were right. I'm in love with Joey's girlfriend.
All right buddy, way to go!
Hi, it's me.
Look all I know is when Monica and I went to see them, we had fun! And there's another reason too.
Really?!
All right buddy, time to roll over. No-no! No, no-n-n-n-no!! You are going to a clinic! You're going to a clinic, and a pyjama store!
Hi, honey! I'm home!
Ya know Phoebs, don't feel so bad for 'em. After they're done playing, I break out the little plastic women and everybody has a pretty good time.
Okay.
Fine with me.
Uh, yes, yes it is.
There you are.
Monica...
You got it. Good woman! Could we get a bottle of your most overpriced champagne?
Well y'know, Monica and I were friends before we started dating. So maybe-maybe that's it?
No, it's not like, like Phil Spiderman. He's a spider, man. Y'know like ah, like Goldman is a last name, but there's no Gold Man.
Okay, you guys uh, you guys pick first
I happen to know a Fun Bob.
So, you busy Thursday?
Yeah.
What a great apology! And you accept! Okay, bye-bye!
All right listen, I have to go to the bathroom, but if the place with the big fish comes up again. I'd like know whether that's several big fish or just one big fish.
Yes!
They have that on the napkins at the club.
I thought your time ran out.
I stayed home from work today while you were at rehearsal so somebody could be here with our chick!
And I'm sure we're all very excited that Ross and Emily are getting married at Montgomery Hall. I mean to think, my friend getting married in Monty Hall. Ohh, come on!! Monty Hall!! Lets make a Deal!! Come on, you people!! All right, forget it!! Congratulations, Ross and Emily.
Well where... Where did she go?
Okay, we have our stripper. A miss Crystal Chandelier.
Sorry man.
I didn't realize that.
Oh thanks.
Yeah?
Ooh, this is a Dear Diary moment.
Why not?! I mean it's just, it's just climbing! It's just, it's just steep!
Listen to me!!
No, no, Phoebs. You know why? Cause he's dead.
Yeah, this more than anything else, is the staging area.
Big dog?
I think you played the Gunther card too soon.
Y'know what I just realized? You just freaked out about our relationship.
Okay, so what name am I cool enough to pull off?
Okay.
So take care.
All right, I have to get that, but no-no. Hello? Hi! Yeah listen, I'm, I'm in need of a stripper and I was told that you do that. Let me ask you this, what, what do you do for the extra hundred? So would I, would I have to provide the grapes?
Yeah, I can say that I have a conference and you can say you have a chef thing.
That's so funny, 'cause I was thinking you look more like Joey Tribbiani, man slash woman.
We're doomed. Okay, they're gonna take 50 bucks out of our accounts for the rest of our lives. What are we gonna do?
Jeez, what a baby.
My lighter's in there!
Well, it's not like I went to Spain. I went to the bathroom, you knew I was coming back.
Wow! That sandwich really does smell good.
It is so good to see you!
Ya know, my cousin went to hell on a football scholarship.
Ok, that's Eric.
Who?
No. How are ya Paul?
Monica, you remember me telling you that joke, right?
Yes, please don't spoil all this fun.
Oh that's not true! That's not true! I got her that backpack and she loved it! I remember how much she was crying the day when that big dog ran off with it... Oh, there was no big dog. All right this sucks! I already got her this briefcase, and I had R.G. put on it... Her initials...
So tell me something, is leaving the Christmas lights up part of your plan to keep us merry all year long?
Oh, I'm so glad we cleared that up. Look, I'm sorry, some things are different for men and for women.
Okay!
I didn't know that.
You can't just call Monica's room.
Great. It was great. She's ah, she's great, great looking, great personality, she's greatness.
Why do they put so much steam in there?!
Open up! Open up! Open up!
Oh, I have to get married in James Bond's tux!
OK Phoebs, how many do you want?
April 18th, excessive noise. Italian guy's gay roommate comes home with the dry-cleaning. Well that's excellent.
Neat. I'm gonna die alone.
Well you know, we got to talking and uh, he said he needed a place and I had a spare room.
Great job with the cups, Pheebs!
Wait a minute, I can't give this to her.
Yeah, for about 30 minutes.
No, no, the actual cartoon character. Of course the balloon. It's all over the news. Right before he reached Macy's, he broke free and was spotted flying over Washington Square Park. I'm goin' to the roof, who's with me?
I was not trying them out, Susie asked me to wear them.
And I'm blah? Listen, the only thing more boring than watching modern dance is having to listen to you talk about it, "Oh Chandler, I just lost myself in the moment."
Monica and I are engaged.
Everything's gonna be all right. Okay, Dick?
Okay! So, what do you girls have planned for tonight?
Which I may say, right now, is out of control.
She's not gonna care if I put her stuff back in the same stupid place.
By then, the cheesecake may have gone bad. We don't want her to come back to bad cheesecake.
Yes!!
Okay, bye, champ. Now, I know there's gonna be a lot of babes in San Diego, but remember, there's also a lot to learn.
What are you guys doing out here?
At a fake game!!
Oh, and don't get me wrong, I appreciate the sentiment. It's just that I, I have a rather, sensitive posterior, and ah, besides, it's making all the other guys jealous.
Well, if it helps there were only three. So it would just be for tonight, right?
Nothing for you, you have Paolo. You don't have to face the horrible pressures of this holiday: desperate scramble to find anything with lips just so you can have someone to kiss when the ball drops!! Man, I'm talking loud!
You put your fist through the wall?
Have you seen Joey?
Oh, come on, there's a rest stop right up there! Come on, I really have to goooooooooo.
Yeah. Y'know I keep thinking that something stupid is gonna come up and I'll go all...Chandler. But nothing has.
You know the hotels?
Yeah, okay.
Yeah, well, I miss the tip! It's the best part. It has the nail.
Right on! Oh! Uh, but, don't take to long okay? 'Cause uh, we're gonna test out our fake ID's tonight, right Clifford Alverez.
Yeah.
I spent the entire day with you, why didn't you tell me?!
Bye.
Do either of you have the keys?
Well, it's a pretty big commitment, I mean, what if one of us wants to move out?
Ohhh-hoo, funny story!
Okay! So yeah, maybe we can get together umm... Can you hold for one second please? What?!
See, I'm finding out all this stuff about you today, like you like the Law & Order and that you flirted with every guy in the Tri-State area!
Well, uh, Dr. Greene, where are you going?
But then later that night...
Stop that now!
Thanks.
Have you figured out what started the fire Mr. Fireman?
Oh come on man! At least let me finish this last one.
Well, I don't know what mad him so mad, y'know? All I said was that uh, I didn't think this wasn't gonna be his big break, that this movie wasn't going to do anything for him, and that uh, y'know it didn't sound like a real movie--Okay, he should've pushed me off of the bridge.
Sure.
Yeah, well, you're wrong! Okay, you're wrong.
No. Not anymore.
You've got it.
Hey, you're gonna be fine. You're one of the most caring, most responsible men in North America. You're gonna make a great dad.
Y'know what, I think we can go out there. I mean they have more important things to worry about.
Joey, why is your cable out?
Hey!
I don't want to say.
The hot chicks?
Bye, momi-moo.
I think you smell great!
Well what... Y'know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna go over there; I'm gonna kick his ass! Will you help me?!
Hey, I can be pretty charming, babe, I won YOU over, didn't I?
You got a Cheeto on your face man.
Okay, will you just go help her change please!
What does it look like I'm doing? I am cleaning!
I don't know exactly.
Hey! Oh, good, Ross! You're parents like me, right?
Look, Ross, you gotta understand, between us we haven't had a relationship that has lasted longer than a Mento. You, however have had the love of a woman for four years. Four years of closeness and sharing at the end of which she ripped your heart out, and that is why we don't do it! I don't think that was my point!
Well, there are other ways of winning back your money, how about a little uh, a little Blackjack?
Sure. What's up?
He paints quite a picture doesn't he?
Hey Joe what's up?
It's okay, the duck's using our bathroom anyway. Hey Joe! What are you getting Kathy for her birthday?
Hey!
We actually missed it.
Well actually uh, there was something we wanted to tell you about the wedding. Um, it's going to be a small ceremony. Uh, tiny! We're not even sure why we're having it.
Well, wait there's, there's more. See the contact paper is to go into your brand new drawer. See, the drawer actually goes in my dresser.
Air hole! Air hole!!
Really?! You do that?
Me too.
You're kidding! Did you tell her I wasn't?
It is to me. You wanted to sleep with Batman, and instead you had to settle for Robin.
Well, Joey, I wrote a little song today. It's called Get Up.
Hey.
Chelsea.
Dee, the sarcastic sister from Whats Happening.
Ross is Batman!
How much did I love The King and I?
Hey, anybody got a length of rope about six feet long with a little nouse at the end?
Okay. Okay. Yes honey, I made it myself. I can't do it. I can't do it. Oh! Oh! A mixed tape! A mixed tape!!
She's moving on! Okay, if it's not this guy, it's gonna be somebody else! And unless you're thinking about subletting my peep hole, you are going to have to get used to the fact that the relationship is over! Okay, man? It's over.
Okay, this is good, this is good. All right listen, I have one. Janice likes to cuddle, at night, which, you know I'm all for. But, uh, you know when you want to go to sleep, you want some space. So, uh, how do I tell her that without, you know, accidentally calling her fat or something.
Good night.
And it's not as if you have a boyfriend's shoulder to cry on.
Oh yeah, it's actually in my bedroom.
Oh, come on! You've been acting strange all day!
Yeah, now how's that going though? Are you okay with the not-flirting thing?
Hey Phoebe!
Well seeing that drunk Santa wet himself, really perked up my Christmas.
Okay, good-bye. Good-bye.
I mean, if it were me, I think I'd have difficulty just getting out of bed at all.
Oh, okay!
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you! And you are about to marry a wonderful man! Hey! I'm marrying a dead woman!
Great story again! The yarns that you weave! Woo-hoo-hoo!
All right! Fine! I'm going. But when I get back it's chair sitting, and I'm the guy who's....sitting in a chair!
Ohh, umm, y'know what, I already ate.
No, Janice.
I am, I'm ignoring you.
Oh, so you're divorced?
This is so sad. I mean, I only have like ten pins.
Wow, I don't know what to say. Wow, I, I don't know what to say.
Oh, don't thank me, thank the jerk that never showed up. Okay, I gotta get to get to work.
Oh, we could do this all day.
Damn Rollos!
Just a little bit of sugar.
Noho. Who doesn't they like me?
This is ridiculous.
Do you know what just happened?
Oh yeah, that's very nice. Plus, y'know they were free and they're too small.
Hey, you have nothing but talk about her for the last 48 hours! If you were in a school yard you'd be pulling her pigtails and pushing her down now!
Well, either that or uh...
Woah, woah, I've put on a little weight?
I can't believe she cracked your code!
Really?
I know.
Y'know Richard...you are a good guy.
Could there be more Kims?
You really like it?
So what do you say, maybe sometime I hold your gun?
I'm good.
All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring. Now I don't know what to do, everybody starts looking at me.
Yeah, and I don't have any cologne.
Y'know what? You should go to my guy, because when I went in there with my third nipple. He just lopped it right off. Y'know? So I guess I'm lucky. I mean not as lucky as people who were born with two nipples.
Hi! Hi! You're crazy! Okay? This is Emily. Emily is straight.
Uh, Ross?
Julie Grath, my camp girlfriend.
The actor playing Mac couldn't do it, they needed to see you at 2 o'clock.
Can we start over?
I think it's great. It's great. Y'know, they're thinking of changing the name of this place.
You wanna play?
You got your passport?
Maybe 'cause the last one was made by Pepperidge Farm. Look Eddie, isn't there something else you're supposed to be doing right now?
What?
So tell me, how do- how do you think your husband would feel about you sitting here with me?...Sliding your foot so far up my pant leg you can count the change in my pocket?
Uh, let's see... Alvin... Simon... Theodore.... no.
So, ahh, how are ya? How ya...How ya... You okay?
Well, we are great guys.
See uh, that's-that's actually what I wanted to talk to you about. I-I think I know who the other guy is.
Oh no, yes we do my man. Remember when we were back in college and we went to that spring dance and you walked right up to that girl you liked and you could not stop talking about the Irish potato famine?
Stay back, I've got kiwi. Run, Joey, Run!
OK, I guess this is gonna seem kinda bittersweet now, but... Joey, that's who.
No we didn't!
Do I ever.
Oh, aaaah!
What are you doing tonight?
That's funny, I saw no phlegm.
All right, let me in.
Ross, ten o'clock.
Hey.
Forget it, that's off.
And yet, believable. So I decided not to fire her again until I can be assured that she will be no threat to herself, or others.
That's what I did when I lost my Clydesdales.
Y'know what maybe it's gonna be okay, I mean it's been a week.
Oh, yeah, I don't know what they were doing, but at one point sea turtles actually came up to the house.
They're still just friends, right?
All right! I'm putting it out, I'm putting it out.
Okay.
Was his question what's more boring than him?
Thanks.
Daddy. All right look, here's the story. Well, we had just finished playing racquetball and we were gonna take a steam. I walk into the steam room and it was really steamy. So I take off my glasses and that's when in happened.
What?
He took my essence!
I'm just trying to help you out! Okay? I wanna make sure that you're okay.
Yes, the doctors say if they remove it, he'll die.
I am your friend, and I am not gonna let you do this!! You are surprisingly strong!
Half a tank? We still got a lot of high-speed chasing to do!
Hey!
You gotta let me slam the door!
All right!
Ho-ho, so hard we had to throw out your underwear again?
Yeah, it's beautiful.
Yes, hitting her with a frying pan's a good idea. We might wanna have a backup plan, though, just in case she isn't a cartoon.
I'm never gonna find a roommate, ever.
Screw the Knicks!
What? Are you kidding? That was like 16 years ago.
Okay, bye!
Susie Moss, right, yeah, wow, you look. . . great job growing up.
I'm still mad at you for not telling me.
Well, uh, we can talk about that too Pheebs.
Okay! Now I assume the Saucer card came up when you played last.
Prague?
Thank God!
Yes!
Monica.
I don't know. I can't--I just, I can't get her out of my head. Y'know? I mean, I'm a very bad person. I'm a very, very bad person. I'm a horrible person. No you're not Chandler! We still love you Chandler!
All right look, forget it, forget it. You told her you love her, it's over.
Emotional Knapsack?
Well, doesn't the fact that I wore the bracelet even though I hated it say something about our friendship and how much it means to me?
Lets not do that any more.
What?!
Yeah, y'know what I got a better idea. How-how 'bout it blocks none of mine door and a lot of yours?
And here is the bottle of wine for you to bring over tonight. You were also going to buy Monica flowers but you couldn't afford it, because you paid dinner last night.
Oh, come on. What was with that whole Black Bart speech? : "When I play poker, I'm not a nice guy!"
Oh man, I am so sorry. Are, are you okay?
Are you telling me that you bought the chair that is making all other lounge systems obsolete? The chair that Sit magazine called the Chair of the Year?
Okay, anything for you sir?
I'm telling you this thing won't print. Yes, I pressed that button like 100 times. You know, for a hot line you are not so hot. What? What is that in the background? Are you watching Star Trek?
That's sweet.
No, it was me. I'm sorry. I over reacted.
They don't have those.
You're definitely scaring here.
Okay, well, it's definite, two more weeks of winter.
Did she call? You-you told her I was sick right? Always tell her I am sick!
Which is why Asteroids is perfect! It's the oldest game!
Then free as a bird. What's up?
Hey, y'know what we can do? Y'know, now that we are up? We can just like talk to each other all night long, y'know like we did when we were first going out. It'd be fun!
Well, your kind of sitting in my seat.
Ugh, we have already proved that we are hot! Okay? So why-why are you getting so obsessed about this thing?!
Are you okay? I'm so sorry, he wouldn't leave. He kept asking me about chicken.
Okay, there are no famous Joey's. Except for, huh, Joey Buttafucco.
So uh Monica, do you, do you like the Law & Order?
Why yes Ross, pressing my third nipple opens the delivery entrance to the magical land of Narnia.
Hey Joe! I was just watching a movie-e-e...
Uh-oh.
Had it.
Monica and I almost got married last night.
Well, I thought you guys were cuddlily sleepers.
Hey man, look it's my best bud. How ya doin? Wow, you are really gettin' good at that Marcel Marceau thing. Hey, whaddya say uh, we play some ball, you and me, huh, whaddya say? OK, that's my bad.
Yeah okay. Well, what's the next little bit?
Fine!
Because I'm in love with Monica!!
So will I.
Yeah, well, don't expect that to happen anytime soon!
Huh.
Hey!!
Yeah so, Tuesday?
Now I know it's been awhile, but I took it as a good sign.
Y'know, I was hoping for a little more enthusiasm.
It could've been worse, he could've shot her.
Y'know, I can't believe Kathy did this too me. I really, thought that she was the one. I tell you what, from now on I'm never getting out of this chair, ever! Okay? From now on, this chair is the one! You wanna what else is the one? My sweat pants!
Why two?
You're right, I know.
Top of the world? Dock of the bay? I'm out.
How long have we been home?
See that is the problem with invisible dentists.
Mine is the red one! Oh God. Can open, worms everywhere.
Yes! Well that-yes.
Fun Bobby? Your ex-boyfriend Fun Bobby?
Okay.
Hey!
Oh no, it's terrific, it's... it's... y'know, you deserve this, after all your years of struggling, you've finally been able to crack your way into showbusiness.
Hey, Kicky. What're you doing?
Thanks. What, let me have her?! What do mean? Like if you didn't I wouldn't have a shot?
... And where's this money coming from?
Well, I'm sorry Joe. I didn't think the doctor was gonna buy that it just *fell* out of the socket.
Yeah, I mean when you were late last night, Kathy and I got to talking, and one thing to another and...
Hey! How'd it go?
Oh, yes. Well it's very beautiful. It's cream-colored and tight I don't mean tight, I mean it's not too tight, not that I was looking at-
Hello.
Not once did we do that.
What?
Alrighty.
Well, she's just so much fun with Joey, I just assumed, she'd still be living with him.
Well, not at first.
Oh, yeah, easy for you to say, you don't have to walk around sporting some reject from the Mr. T collection.
I can't believe it. Paolo kissed my mom?
Ooh, that girl that I hate, eww, drives me crazy, eww, eww, oh!
Y'know what, I think this might be one of the times he's wrong.
Look, I figured I would try to convince him not to tell the story anymore, and I figure the best way to do that is face to face-And by face I don't mean his lap. And by face, I don't mean my ass.
Sounds like a really bad idea to me.
So you're just, kinda rubbing it on yourself?
Is it loaded? Oh, little candy hearts. Chan and Jan Forever.
No he's, he's alright, just uh, he spends most of his time in his room.
Y'know, how did I get this reputation as a dropper? Okay? I'm anything but a dropper.
Hey, how's the first day goin'?
We're worried about you.
Forget it, that's off.
Wow, in 45 minutes you can find her twice.
Oh, I am no women, but that is one tasty dish.
I invented the game of Cups as a way to give Joey money.
Hey.
Like an eclipse.
No not Candy Lady.
Maybe we'll have to listen and see!
Didn't you used to call it the Little Major?
Can I finish my story?!
Treeger's snaking the shower drain.
Hey, he's not crying.
Thank you, Joey.
Wh-what?
'Cause, I wanted to uh, give you this.
007?! This is James Bond's tux?!
I think they get it.
That's not funny.
So you knew we were gonna miss the movie!
I spelled out boobies.
I do?
Ah, finally an explanation.
You sure?
Yep! And! A beautiful woman agreed to go out with me. Joey wanted to ask her out, but uh, she picked me.
Yes it would. What do you say to $50?
Oh! Some guy. Some guy. 'Hey Jill, I saw you with some guy last night. Yes, he was some guy.
No-no-Really?!
Yeah.
Ok, Phoebe.
She's one of us now.
Cool, girl roommate.
Yes please.
No, I got him.
Could I borrow it?
What do we use to split it?
That's great.
This is great! Helen, could you come in here for a moment?
Okay, all right. I just spent the entire afternoon looking for a present for Kathy that would be better than the rabbit.
Well, I see you've had a very productive day. Don't you think the cowboy hat is a little much?
Okay. Okay. What are you gonna do to me if you get the part?
I'm not saying it was a good idea, I'm saying I snapped!
You didn't see how mad he was, y'know?
I'm not freaking out. Why would I be freaking out? A woman named Heldi called and said we were getting married, but that happens everyday.
Look, Monica...
By me?
Varrrrrroom! Hey! Watch it lady! Varrrrrrrrrrom! Hey-hey good lookin'! Varrrrrrrrroom. All right, I'll leave. My bed's so boring.
Thanks man.
Is that a swing?
What are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing?
Um, is it sugarless?
Hi.
Oh totally! Pull my finger.
Well, this is much better.
Oh, I just wanted to say, "Hey!"
Okay, I'm going to go stand over there.
It's a nickname, I'll explain later.
I am, I actually am. I mean this is amazing. My entire life I have feared this place, and now that I'm here it's like what was the big deal. I could probably say 'Let's move in together.' and I'd be okay.
But I do know that it's some time tomorrow.
Freedom! I want my freedom! Why won't you here me?! Sophie, help me! Help me!!
Alright, alright, alright. It's been fourteen and a half minutes and you still have not said one word. Oh God, do something. Just make contact, smile!
Come in!
Hey, all right!
All right.
Well, of course I do! My good friend Joey over here.
It could've been worse, he could've shot her.
I got glasses!
Janice's birthday is coming up, I want to get her something speacial. Come in here with me.
Batman has a utility belt!
Well, it sounds kinda stupid... Who's she?
Pheebs! We have to take you to the hospital now!
Oh, ahh, no thanks, I just had an M&M.
Oh yeah, it's great! See you take a tennis ball, a bowl, and some lighter fluid-Op! Op!
No.
Oh, that's good. Maybe he'll hear you and pull the cord.
Oh no-no, I can't do that.
No, I didn't misunderstand, okay? She was all over me! She touched my bicep for crying out loud!
I paid for those tickets!
That's a mailman! That's our mailman! Hi. How are ya?
I can't believe you got us into trouble.
No.
I see, but once you get your first paycheck you'll be springing a big hotel suite, right? I mean, lead in a movie, they must be paying you a lot?
All right, maybe I should call her.
Well, I think it's very brave what you said.
Ooh. Uh, I don't know how to tell you this, but she's in Monica's bedroom, getting it on with Max, that scientist geek. Ooh, look at that, I did know how to tell you.
Um, ok... the... the fifth dentist caved and now they're all recommending Trident?
Joey!
Hey-hey-hey. So what happened? A forest tick you off?
So ah, whatcha watching?
So in your whole life, you've only been with one oh.
I'm sorry man, there's never a good time to stop catching on fire.
Did she see us yet? Did she see us?
I know, I know, but you're gonna have plenty of chances. There are literally thousands of women out there just waiting to screw me over.
So, uhh, em, you want me to uh, give you a hand with the foosball table?
What?
What kind of scary-ass clowns came to your birthday?
Isn't that Ross's money?
Oh, good. Rog is here.
To yourself. Hey-hey-hey, y'know what that's pretty good.
So it did go well.
Secret? Married people aren't supposed to have secrets between one another. We have too much love and respect for one another.
Please, don't take away my cool thing. Please?! Pretty please?!
Hey.
Hey!
Please, please, please, don't be mad at me.
You know, once youre inside, you dont have to knock any more.
Heads it is.
Oh-ho, liked what she saw, huh? Dug my action, did she? Checkin' out the Chan-Chan man!
Were you so late because you were burring this woman?
Oh my God! Those are my bedroom eyes?! Why did you ever sleep with me?
Is he the one with the beautiful wife?
Hello.
Wish me luck.
No, just knowing you're gonna be there is enough.
Huh? Where, whaddya mean?
'Kay!
And I don't wanna say this, I don't you guys to hate me, but uh, I don't think, I can be around that dog anymore. Okay, so either the dog goes, or I go. Oh my god!!
Why?! I mean if this guy was me and it was me who had learned that it was me who was the best you'd ever had, I'd be going like this.
So was I.
Whoa-whoa-whoa!
Crazy bitch.
Okay, on three. One....Two....
No you don't-get it in black, not brown.
See Joe, not that that's not grrreat! But, one of the cool things about having somebody we know perform the ceremony is that it can be about us! Y'know, it can be more personal. You can tell stories about us!
Hello. It's Gandolf!!! So, are you in town? Oh, well, well maybe next time then.
Well, I thought- I thought you talked to Rick.
Well, maybe it's a contest, y'know? Like, collect all five?
I so am.
Yeah, I heard you and Rachel talking.
Oh that's great! Right there! Can we get some of that over here please? There we go.
: I thought we had them!
That's great. All right, I gotta get to work, I got a big dinosaur bone to inspect.
You look beautiful. Is this new?
I wanna quit the gym.
Oh hey listen, don't be mad at him, it's our fault. I'm sorry we've been hoggin so much of his time.
Something else I might have said?
Well, you may wanna rethink the dirty underwear. This is basically the first time she's gonna see your underwearyou want it to be dirty?
You're welcome.
Why can't I tell them that we live together?
Hey, relax I just need more time. We're going to dinner tonight.
Okay, so Richard, Richard!
Oh yeah man. Joey.
Okay, here you go. I have two queens, what do you have?
Seriously? Seriously, no! You can play your own age which is 31!
That's me.
All right, how about we, how 'bout we sell it.
Goodnight.
Oh Mon-Mon-Mon-Mon-look, this is the honeymoon suite. The room expects sex. The room would be disappointed if it didn't get sex. All of the other honeymoon suites would think it was a loser.
So how's it going there in Financial Services?
Wha-
You did.
Okay, I don't think we can turn anymore!
I can't believe I ruined this.
Yeah, well. It's the right thing to do.
What?
I'm just saying that sometimes we like to do stuff that costs a little more.
Hey.
I don't know. It's a bracelet.
Okay!
The... Jamestown colony of Virginia. You see, King George is giving us the land, so...
Dum! Dum-dum-dum! Dum! Dum! Dum! Dum-dum-dum!
Oh that's so sweet! I want to show you something too!
I'm coming already!!
Well, she walked in when I was looking at the ring brochures. You can understand that, right? Guys? Guys?
Okay.
No!
Pheebs, wake up and smell the restraining order.
Why are you screaming and hugging?
You were not supposed to hear that! I said that behind you back!
Uh, what was that?
What are you, what are you gonna show me my clothes?
Well, y'know I'm 29. I mean who needs a savings account.
Because, I-I should've called! Y'know if I had just called her after our big, stupid fight, she never would've gone out with Nick, and they would've ended up in bed together. I threw her at his man nipples!
You have to really wanna see it.
Hey!
Uh, yeah.
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I found this great place called "Invisible things for Kathy." Can you give me a hand with all this stuff?
Okay, okay, here she comes! How do I look? Do I look like a guy who doesn't want to get married?
Let me tell you about this chick I scored with last night! Oh no wait a minute that was you!
No.
Listen, I'm, I'm sorry I didn't make it over there today.
Oh, you should live with Joey, Roll-os everywhere.
It did enter my mind! But then something happened that made it, shoot right out.
Stop it! You're killing me! I think I just moved on to Phase Four!
See ya. Goodbuy you fruit drying psychopath. So you want me to help you unpack your stuff?
Ye-e-es!!
She was a welder.
Ooh, I'm alive with pleasure now.
Bing doesn't seem so weird now, does it?
That's a hernia.
Ah sure. What's in 'em?
Listen, I-I'm gonna grab a beer.
What's an identical hand twin?
And yet you're surprisingly upbeat.
Actually, it's Miss Chinandolor Bong.
Of course the packaging does appeal to grown-ups and kids alike.
We are switching back, right now!
Uh, are you crazy? Are you insane? If you live with Phoebe, you two are gonna be y'know, live-living together!
Whoa! And this manchild has no problem with how old you are?
Come on in.
Oh that's great!
Oh yeah, it's beautiful country up there.
Y'know, I've had dates like this.
Well that's a full cup!
Well, it's because I trust you, you're one of my best friends, and you walked in on me when I was looking at ring brochures.
Right, right. Sometimes you guys just burst into flames.
Don't worry honey, we'll make yours funnier.
That is so not... That is so not... That... Oh, shut up!
I did! But the store wouldn't take her back! So then I took her to the shelter, and you know what I found out?
Then put out fire by peeing, no get invited back.
So we both finished our vows.
Why? Okay? Why? Wh-wh-why did that have to happen?
So, what do you think?
Hi.
All right, look, look. What did... what did you get for Angela Delveccio for her birthday?
Hey, I hear what your saying, okay? And, thanks for the warning.
What?!
I'm the ruptured spleen.
Yep! From now on its gonna be the four of you guys and me and the misses. The little woman. The wife. The old ball and chain.
Ehh.
Hey.
Yeah, listen, how cold is it going to be there? Do I need a coat or will all these sweater vests be enough?
Our guy has great hair.
I can't call her, I left a message! I have some pride.
Hey.
Eh?
Hey! Hey, hey-hey, hey.
And, a lemon lime.
Oh, this is horrible, it's just horrible.
Hey, what are you doing here? Shouldn't you be at work?
What're we gonna do? What're we gonna do?
That-that's bad?
Defend yourself.
Uh why, do you have a lecture?
Yes, but these women are very hot, and they need our help! And they're very hot.
Uh-huh.
I'd carry you around in my pocket.
I can check that for ya.
Oh, you don't want me on the trip?
Pretty good! I told her.
Eh. I thought that was an alp.
Oh, what a crappy night!
So?
Oh, I'm going on the lamb.
Are you serious?! I mean like eloping?! No more stupid wedding stuff?! No more these flowers or these flowers or these flowers-Think of the money we'll save!! We're not eloping. I love the flowers. Can our wedding be bigger please?
Ummmmmmmm, no.
Okay, so he's out of here.
Okay, make sure you look both ways before you cross the street.
You, you are gonna love this.
No, it came out to an even twenty.
Oh, by the way, that is her full name.
Look, maybe I got carried away before. But there's something you gotta know. If I'm the best, it's only because you've made me the best.
And protected them from a tornado?
I'm sorry we, we don't have your sheep.
Two hours, that lasted!
Thanks for picking out the earrings man.
Yeah, he's made phone calls, written letters, he even came to New York, but I always said I was too busy to see him. Y'know it's all very Cats in the Cradle-I don't want to get into it. Here we go.
Is not.
Who's Rick?
Yeah.
Oh, I loved the play. You were great, and Nick ditto. Clearly you're having sex with him.
Sounds great.
You think we're ready for something like that?
Yes, here it comes! I'm stuck here all day, and then you come in and spend two seconds with us and then expect to go off gallivanting with your friends? Well I don't think so mister!
Isn't that what happened with you and the bride's maid?
Oh yeah? Well, how'd she take it?
Nothin! This is the nine millionth ring store we've been too and I can't find the perfect ring! Ugly ring! Ugly ring! Ugly ring! It's a beautiful selection.
Four hours? You guys have been doing this for four hours?
Hi, I'm Chandler. Your live-in boy
I walk into a room and he won't even talk to me, he just mumbles something in Italian. And I know he only knows the bad words.
Joey was in a porno movie.
Y'know what? I can't believe this! Do you know what you did? My girlfriend is out there thinking things over! You made my girlfriend think!!
Work on your music?
How can I dump this woman on Valentine's day?
Well, you want me to uh, clench anything, or-... Susie? Susie.
Ross.
Thank God you didn't try to fan out the magazines. I mean, she'll scratch your eyes right out.
Oh, good!
You don't get a lot of 'doy' these days...
No, you should.
Maureen Rosilla.
Do you want me to be afraid of you?
All right, all right, I'll go sleep with my girlfriend. But I'm just doing it for you guys.
Well, sure, but can you play it on a plane?
Well, there you are! So what did Elizabeth say?
Hi...dad.
I don't care, she slept with me.
Okay, okay, I tell you what. You roll another hard eight; and we get married here tonight.
Yeah, we're gonna have to get you out of those shoes.
Hey guys, what are you doing?
Y'know what? I have been trying to apologize to him all week! If he's not gonna let me do it on the phone, I'm gonna go down there and do it in person.
Well, it still has to go, right?
I love you!
Yeah! No! No! No! Don't fall asleep! Okay, I am going to make you some coffee. And I probably won't spill coffee grounds all over the kitchen floor.
This is the New York Times.
Yeah.
Could you want her more?
Oh-ho, it'll be back. Oh-ho, there's nobody in the room.
Listen, it's kind of an emergency. Well, I guess you know that, or we'd be in the predicament room.
Joey, be a pal. Lift up my hand and smack her with it.
Come on, Ross, you gotta get back in the game here, ok? The Rachel thing's not happening, your ex-wife is a lesbianI don't think we need a third...
Nah-uh! I know you! Okay? I know the thoughts that you have in the head--in your head!
Oh come on!!
Are you serious?
Oh, y'know, y'know what Pheebs?
Are you looking at naked tribe's women?
See? Now, that's why only the little fake men are supposed to do all the kicking.
We have heard you play.
Oh, okay Ross. Listen, this pen is kinda getting boring, so can you pick me up some porn?
I'm intrigued.
Yeah, I understand.
I'm gonna ask Monica to marry me.
Way to be cool, man.
This-this Fonzie person you keep referring too, is that uh, is that another doctor?
So uh, what are you in for?
Wait, wait! Wh-what are you doing here?
Woah, hey, yo.
Yeah, well, she's probably talking to Richard.
Nothing.
No, no no no. You'll be fine. Hillary's bind, right?
What is it doing here?
I'm trppd... in an ATM vstbl... wth Jll Gdcr!
Did you hear that?
Why haven't you told them?!
Easy for you to say; you'll be wearing a veil.
...little playthings with yarn?
What, what, what?!
Okay.
All right. I'll tell you what. When we're 40, if neither one of us are married, what do you say you and I get together and have one?
What just happened?
Thanks, I'm glad you see it that way.
Too many jokes... must mock Joey!
Congratulations.
Wouldn't that be Frank the III?
Nice!
Bye-bye.
Oh, you're right I, I should play in the hay. Forget about the fact that I just dropped 400 dollars to replace a bracelet that I hated to begin with. Bring on the hay.
Cry?! I just found a talking puppy, I'm rich!
You know, you think I would.
Sir, can I ask you to umm, could you...hold out that ring and ask me to marry you?
That's a good plan, Joe. Next time we wanna pick up women, we should just go to the park and make out. Taxi, taxi!
So- you can tell?
Well, we're really not that close. Okay, so I guess this is uh, good-bye then.
Those were like the best seats ever.
I'm not even getting married! Okay, this is a question for science fiction writers!
Making chocolate milk. Do you want some?
Say again?
Oh, man. I'm sorry, I'm so-so sorry.
They're not even paying ya! This doesn't even sound like a real movie!
You don't have it.
I do not hate Ross!
So-If you wear that you'll make mine less special.
If you get this one, we buy everybody here a steak dinner!
"Benefits lapsed."
We used them as pillows when we went camping.
Okay, one question.
Oh, okay, thanks.
I got a good one, I got a good one! I once walked in on both my parents making love to the same guy.
He just said, "No strippers."
Well, thanks man. Now I can get my pony.
No! Smokes-A-Lot Lady blew smoke directly into my mouth. Eh-uh-are you okay?
Probably because...
Rachel, wait, wait.
Mmmm. Not tonight, honey. I got an early day tomorrow.
No, did he hug you?!
Well, look it's been a really emotional time y'know, and you've had a lot to drink. And you've just got to let that go okay? I mean you were the most beautiful in the room tonight!
And I think Ross is generous too.
He's being silly, because he knows that we enjoy the silliness!
There's a Phoebe on my sandwich!
Aww, I love you so...
Yes! I'm fine. In fact I've been fine for a long time now and I think, the reason is you.
You're a little high maintenance.
Yes, and we're very excited about it.
'S'why I'm dancing...
Yeah, I know, but all of those little annoying things she did before we fell in love? Like her voice, her laugh, her personality-Well, they're all back! Y'know? And she's picked up like nine new ones!
Well, why can't you do them tomorrow?
Oh yes, sir! Put me out of my misery. Are you sure you never played pro? Please let them win!
Hey! Well, I've been preparing for that my entire life! Or something about you that's mean!
Im just trying to find the right moment, you know?
No, we're still together. Yeah we went out for two summers, and then I broke up with her.
Can I give you a present now?
She's really going to love this, you know? The bottom line is I want her to have it, even if I don't get to be the one who gives it to her.
Yeah, I'm kinda wishing everyone wasn't here right now.
Really? Worse than, "More turkey Mr. Chandler?"
Do you think that there's a town in Missouri or some place called Sample? And ah, as you're driving into town there's-there's like a sign, and it says "You're in Sample."
Ok, Monica, only dogs can hear you now, so, look, the door's open. Here we go.
Oh yeah! With who?
Our kids are gonna be fat aren't they.
You look good.
I may have.
I am totally picturing you with all those women!
Yes! Ross, you have to stay!
We can't do that that's insane. I mean 'A' he could wake up and 'B' y'know, let's go for it.
What a wank!
Phebes, it was your birthday, like, months ago.
Well, she seems very nice and everything, but that whole thing about her coming all the way down here, just to see if I was okay? I mean,... how needy is that?
I can't believe she's married.
Excuse me? You don't think I could get a Brian? Because I could get a Brian. Believe you me. ...I'm really not.
Cupping.
What did you just do?
Oh good, I was hoping that would come up.
Wow, what a geek. They spent $69.95 on a Wonder Mop.
Yes, he is!
Just tryin' somethin' here, ya know.
Oh, I couldn't be happier.
You ah, you have, you have to leave, now? How come?
Yes please.
All right, I'll tell ya what, the next time you ask me a question like that I'll lie.
Well, close to...
Bad dream?
So how'd it go?
All right, there's a nuclear holocaust, I'm the last man on Earth. Would you go out with me?
I personally could have a gallon of Alan.
Yeah. Thanks for making me do this.
I've had a very long, hard day.
Y'know what? We're not sad, we're not sad, we're just not 21 anymore. Y'know? I'm 29 years old, damnit! And I want to sit in a comfortable chair, and watch television and go to bed at a reasonable hour!
Uh, yeah, I just got my pick-up sticks back from the shop. Bring your nerves of steel.
And we just sit here. I mean if I die the only way people would even know I was here, would be by the ass print on this chair! Look, we have to do something. Okay? Something huge!
Oh. Oh, God!
Please tell me you got the message!
You took off your pants and climbed under the sheets!
Okay. All right.
Yeah, I know that means buddy!
That's great!
No. No!
Oh my good God.
Oh, so that's this is gonna work now? You're just gonna order me around all the time?
That's a pig.
She was kidding.
Listen, I just wanted to apologize about this afternoon and the whole massage thing. Y'know? I-I really like 'em.
Yeah.
Hey!
Okay! Okay! Okay! You win! You win!! I can't have sex with ya!
'Scuse me.
I was being Shelly Winters from The Poseidon Adventure.
That was there when I got here.
You okay there man?
If I help, we can find 'em faster!
Man, if you tried something like that on my birthday, you'd be starin' at the business end of a hissy fit.
I'm not even... I'm not even...
Y'know what, pretty good.
Joe...
He's finally happy with that and walks away.
Oh hey Rachel, sweetheart? You have got to tell the post office that you have moved. Okay? We are still getting all your bills and stuff.
Hey.
I'll see you guys later, I gotta go...do a thing.
Oh, that's-that's okay, no problem.
Look I never should have kissed your girlfriend, but I'm...
Don't do anything. Keep it inside. Learn how to hide your feelings! Don't cry outloud.
You're kidding right?
Oh come on, it was so obvious! There was no chemistry between you two!
That's weird. I don't think my boss likes me either.
Hi. You guys have any wrapping paper?
Well, I feel like a snack!
Rachel lost Marcel.
Hey, so can you make it on Friday?
Yes! Yes, but I can only pay $8,000.
Really.
Yes because uh, you look so young.
The man is showing brain.
Run, Joey! Run for your life!
Yeah, I ended up in the storage room, and not alone.
Yes. It's very difficult to appreciate a Thanksgiving dinner once you've seen it in reverse.
Sorry! I-I-I don't know what to say.
Well let's see, there was the guy with the ferrets, that's plural. The spitter. Oh-ho, and yes, the guy that enjoyed my name so much he felt the need to make a little noise every time he said it. Nice to meet you, Chandler Bing Bing! Great apartment Chandler Bing, Bing!
Honey, it is not a date! I haven't talked to her in ten years! You can't just call up somebody you haven't talked to in ten years and ask them for a favor. There are rules, y'know? You gotta, you got to put in some time.
But I just wa...
Really? Okay. Great!
Well, what did the police say?
Alright, OK, alright. But if we put on spandex and my boobs are bigger than yours, I'm goin' home.
Well, no, although I did have an imaginary friend, who... my parents actually preferred.
Yeah, o-okay.
That's still in there?!
Oh, no, no, no, don't go! I've scared ya'! I've said too much! I'm hopeless, and awkward, and desperate for love!! Hey, Janice! It's me. Um, yeah, I-I-I just wanna apologize in advance for having chased you down the street.
What?
Phoebe and Rachel! So the people that knew about our wedding before me were you, Phoebe and Rachel, Heldi, and apparently some band called Starlight Magic 7 who are available by the way!
Well there you go.
Eldad is much more cooperative! And he can dance! You dance for Rachel!
Oh yeah! Yeah, so you-you bumped into Richard! You grabbed a bite! It's no big deal.
All right, look! Look. I think I can explain this.
Totally crazy stupid.
He's open!
Okay well, this side looks bigger. Uh... There's more crust on this side. Y'know? So, maybe if I measured...
This is Chandler Bing! This is Chandler Bing!
You don't have to stop having fun just because I'm here. Kathy didn't cheat on all of you. Well, except you.
See, that's why we don't let her play.
Do you know why?
Y'know, I don't know why you're so embarrassed, they were very nice boobies.
Danielle! Hi! Uh- everybody, this is Danielle, Danielle, everybody.
Oh, yay...
Come on, you're going to Bloomingdale's with Julie? That's like cheating on Rachel in her house of worship.
You told him to play the boxer gay!!
Oh, who should I blame? The nice bell man who had to drag out luggage to 10 different rooms?
How do you not fall down more?
Ok, that's me.
Right here!
Well, actually, yesterday I was smoking again. Today, I'm, I'm smoking still.
Yo!! Spackel boy! Get up!
For three years?
No-no, not something stupid, something huge.
Sounds like a fun party.
Yes, I-I know that you do, but I think one of the reasons people were complaining though, was that they paid to hear the actor sing Old Man River.
Hey, look, Phoebe I wanted to meet her in person too, okay, but she's married, she has a husband.
How can he do that? Didn't you sign a lease?
No?
Ah, let's see. What next? Blow a bubble. A bubble's good. It's got a... boyish charm, it's impish. Here we go.
You know when guys hang out they don't just drink some beer and hammer up drywall?
Thank you for writing your book. Its-its uh, great book and you are the queen of everything.
Ya know I remember my father, all dressed up in the red suit, the big black boots, and the patent leather belt, sneakin around downstairs. He didn't want anybody to see him but he'd be drunk so he'd stumble, crash into something and wake everybody up.
I don't know if I've told you this, but he's kinda tried to get in contact with me a lot over the last few years
Have you ever been with a woman?
Um, we're kind of having an emergency and we-we were looking for something...
Could've been a peach.
Yeah, well sure, when he did it, it was funny. When I did it to my boss's hat. . . all of the sudden I have this big attitude problem.
Oh-ho-ho-ho-no! No! No switching! No sharing, and don't come crying to me! Ha-ha-ha! I may just sit here and have my cake all day! Just sit here in the hallway and eat my...
Wellll?
You're our age!
I know that one! ...No, that's Popes into a Volkswagen.
Uh, hey!
Oh, uh, yeah... I just knew that sometimes when you're writing, you... you don't always know the exact time.
Why is Phoebe singing to Carl Mulden?
Hey.
Okay, bye! Oh my God!!
I know, just quick-quick question, quick question. Which one was Deep Impact and which one was Armageddon?
You mean with Casey.
I'm an alien. I'm an alien.
We have to leave for New York in an hour.
All right! Isn't this a woman's hat?
I'll cancel the sodas.
Like finding money with naked people on it!
How can you not be wearing any underwear?
Okay. Here's a question you never have to ask. My dad just called and wanted to know if he could borrow one of your pearl necklaces.
I'm going crazy! Okay? Do you have any thing around here that looks homemade?
You can tell us.
Yes, and I was saying the actual words.
OK.
Hey, Janice.
And say nothing?
I can't believe it! We're here!
Pretty well. Except for the stapler thing. Little tip: if youre ever in a similar situation, never ever leave your hand... ..on the desk.
Yes, I realise that.
All right Joey, be nice. So does he have a hump? A hump and a hairpiece?
So, you uh, you think that Speed Racer guy gets a lot of tickets er?
All right! Bring it on, you...
It is the softest hair! Touch it!
See now it feels like Christmas!
Ah, it's just a weekend, big deal!
Yeah, like that thought never entered my mind.
Ha! Ha! Ha!
Uh, four, a boy, twin girls and another boy.
Skull?
No, there are great pictures of you standing next to a guy who's going like this...
Oh, I don't think I ever heard that story.
All right, buddy!
Yeah! Okay, go, go, go get him.
No Rach, it's not just you. My thirtieth birthday certainly wasn't that much fun.
That's what they'll call us.
Hey!
Ok, pure evil, horny and alone. I've done this.
Okay, that hurt us.
Oh, he works in the Fine Foods division.
Okaaay, rock, hard place, me.
I'm not mad.
I am telling you, years from now, schoolchildren will study it as one of the greatest first dates of all time. It was unbelievable! We could totally be ourselves, we didn't have to play any games...
....with??
Ahh, so how many cameras are actually on you?
Don't take this personally okay? It's just that I just can't have sex with a sick person.
You don't turn and slide, you throw it out! I'm tired of having to get a tetanus shot every time I get dressed!
Really?
Look, I understand, but I have to put my foot down. Okay? The answer is no.
No. Is there anyway, anyway you think he'll understand this?
No, Beth doesn't die, she doesn't die. Does she Rachel?
Oh, I hate that. I once had a thing of half and half, stole my car.
Perfect decibel.
Rent?
If it helps, I could slide over.
Y'know, I uh.. just thought I'd throw this out here. I'm no math whiz, but I do believe there are three girls and three guys right here.
Listen, this is totally getting out of hand! Okay? She wants me to put lotion on her!
I'm fine.
Did they teach you that in your anger management class?
And I was a perfect gentleman and I walked her to her hotel room and said goodnight.
Double it!
Okay. Listen-listen, we're not gonna have to walk this way the entire time are we?
Hey that's what I tell girls about me.
Ok, think, what would Jack and Chrissy do?
Oh.
Okay. I just wanted them to hear it from somebody else.
Okay.
Look, forget it. We tried, but Phase Three is a lost cause, Okay? Those strippers were insanely hot, and I couldn't picture myself with any of them.
Hey, guys, it's after midnight, merry Christmas everyone.
Flashdance.
Ya know there isn't a part of that sentence I don't need explained.
I hit her in the eye! I hit her in the eye! This is the worst break-up in the history of the world.
Yes, and while I'm doing that, Ross has a great computer story for you.
I don't know! He went crazy! Y'know, we were playing that game where you-you ask a question and you answer it really fast.
But you're still my friend?
When'd you meet her?
Yes, and I get my ya-yas from Ikea. You have to put them together yourself, but they cost a little less.
Well she, she wouldn't do that, she's with, she's with me.
We don't need to remedy that.
Oh, oh, c'mon in.
No I didn't!
Well, maybe it was God, doing me.
Hi!
Yeah, I mean, it would be rude to them for us to leave now.
I am now!
So, we gettin' a fish?
Oh-oh-hey!
The reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make a big deal out of it.
Basically we just feel that he's...
You know, it's funny when my parents got divorced, they sent me to this shrink, and she told me that all kids have a tendency to blame themselves. But in your case it's actually kinda true.
Guys! Guys! Come on! It's Thanksgiving, it's not important who wins or loses. The important thing is, the Dutch girl picked me! Me! Not you! Holland loves Chandler! Thank you, Amsterdam! Good night!!
Yeah umm, they're called wallets.
Because, you know, you don't have to. If you want, you could just take a nap right here.
Cookie?
Elizabeth Hornswoggle?
Okay, we-we swallow our feelings. Even if it means we're unhappy forever. Sound good?
Oh, hurry up. I want to sign that.
Now this feels like Thanksgiving.
Before you say anything, have we got a story for you! Guess who we bumped into at dinner!
Now Monica, I know you're upset, but don't forget. There is going to be a wedding, you are going to throw the bouquet, and then there's going to be a honeymoon, maybe in Paris.
No. When it comes to sweets, he's surprisingly strict.
Right.
Where?
So is your apron. You're wearing it like a cape.
Uhh, no.
What?! Ow!
What do we do? What do we do?
That would be impossible to resist if you weren't all drippy here.
Well, somebody should.
Hi, listen, I'm sorry about before. I don't need to have a game room. I mean when I was a kid I only played those games because I couldn't get girls, and now I can 'em-Now, I have you. Not-not that I think that I have you or think of you as property in any sort of way, I see women...
I can save you time ladies, I'm right here.
Well that's good. Because you didn't! And I'm incredibly happy for ya!!
Okay!
All right, great, road trip baby! This okay with you?
Okay, if you see a little version of me in there? Kill it!
It's true.
You're okay there?
The only way that I said six would be if the seven's, let meet at seven, not at six.
Not yet.
What about that circled one?
Pirates again?
No, no, no.
Technically we could have sex again. What do you think, bossy and domineering?!
Oh-ho-ho, I don't think so!
And to you too, Helen.
Yeah.
Steps! Slut! You will all be very happy to hear that Kathy is sleeping with that guy!
Look, you have to help me! Okay? I mean, I know what to do with a woman, y'know, I know where everything goes, it's always nice. But I need to know what makes it go from nice to, "My God! Somebody's killing her in there!"
No! No! No! I can't do that!
Happy birthday! I'm sorry.
Hey, you guys!
They put you in jail?
Well you might if it were anything like 7!
Okay, did you see that?! With the inappropriate and the pinching!!
Pheebs, if she could come back as a couch, we'd really appreciate it.
Marcel?
Will you excuse me I have to um.....
Okay. Bye.
Oh-oh.
Look, I-I'm just gonna be right across the hall and I promise you, the minute Monica and I break up I'm moving right back in with you!
Okay, could you just stop talking for a second? Yemen. That's right, yes, I'm being transferred to Yemen!
Joey kicked me out of the car on the George Washington bridge!
Sure. And listen, thanks for doing that for us, by the way.
Let me ask you, why is everybody using these tiny lights nowadays? I remember when people used to use big lights.
A freakish thin date with a hanger for her head?
So uh, now that little Chandler turned out to be a girl, what are they gonna name her?
Hey. Do you want this scone? It came for me but it would probably rather sleep with you!
Oh No, It's Terrific, It'S- It'S- Y'Know, You Deserve This, After All Your Years Of Struggling, You'Ve Finally Been Able To Crack Your Way Into Show Business.
I don't know R.G., I was thinking something girlie for your office.
He can do more than that! He can destroy the universe!
Fine.
Oh, Richard. That's all I ever hear, Richard, Richard, Richard!
Look, I thought about it too, and I'm sorry. I think we should spend all of the money on the wedding.
Did you have a crush on me, when you first met me?
Toootal chick-flick.
Okay.
She said she'd call me.
Blue blazer back. He-he wants it back.
Hey Mon, how's it going?
Oh, that was my work laugh.
I'm sorry, I thought you were Joey's other grandmother. I've done it again.
We can't accept this.
I'm not fine. Here she comes.
In a foreign, romantic country...
Hey, woah, hey, woah.
Hey, listen, why don't we go change in my room?
Hey, Pheebs!
Oh my God!
Oh, hey.
Surprise!!
Oh no-no-no, no more offers. You can't offer anything to us!
No, see, I'm trying this new screening thing. You know, I figure if I'm always answering the phone, people'll think I don't have a life. My god, Rodrigo never gets pinned.
Honestly? Me too.
Oh that's not bad, Pheebs?
You tell me! Maybe, it's because I was just fooling with my ex! Oh no-no-no-no, no-no-no-no, that was you!!
Yeah!
Honey, it's gonna be okay.
Hey!
Hey, come on, give me a break, I'm out on a limb here.
Hey! Can you take a duck and a chick to the theatre?
Where did you, when did you, how did you... How did you get a girl like that?
All right, rock on.
So great things are happening at work and in your personal life!
What if Mary-Angela comes to the door and I ask for Mary-Angela?
Oh! Oh! That's so hard.
You can't wear that! I'm wearing the famous tux! James Bond's tux!
There's not gonna be a next time! You can not ever see him again!
Why would our guy be a weirdo?
Veronica. Look, it's got to be Veronica, the girl in the red skirt. I definitely stuck my tongue down her throat.
Well, we could count again.
And I will cook anything you want in here , and do anything in there!
You got it.
Well, I've got a girl in here.
I can't remember the last time I got a girl to take care of my monkey.
Forty-five minutes? We have tickets to the Musicman at 8:00.
All right, Pheebs, back me up here, ok? You believe in that karma crap, don't you?
Ohh, she's pretty. Pretty ahh, pretty girl, the pretty--she's pretty.
Who sold a story to Archie Comics?!
I can't believe this! What the hell were you thinking?
That's perfect! That's brilliant!
I can't take the big white dog! You love it!
Well, we have a deal, where we each get to pick five celebrities that we can sleep with, and the other one can't get mad.
Okay, so if an eight comes up, we take it as a sign and we do it! {Whoa! Where have I heard that before? Matthew Perry talking about signs in Las Vegas. I guess it must've been some movie I saw.} What do you say?
Hey, what time is it? The big game is about to start!
Yeah, big zero gravity moon steps.
That's... That's was...
Oh yeah, that was great. Thanks to you, the hottest cocktail waitress there is quitting to teach the third grade!
You mean there's more than one of us.
Say Ross, when you picture Phoebe living on the street, is she surrounded by the entire cast of Annie?
Okay! Okay! Okay! I'll do it! Oh God, I thought... Wait a minute, I-I can do this. I thought that it mattered what I said or where I said it. Then I realized the only thing that matters is that you, you make me happier than I ever thought I could be. And if you'll let me, I will spend the rest of my life trying to make you feel the same way. Monica, will you marry me?
Ugh. Just a sec, give me a minute to wake up for this-Ah-ha-ha!! You lost the ring! You're the worst best man ever!
If you listen very carefully, I think its Celebration by Cool and the Gang.
Okay.
So um, how come you guys haven't talked about this before?
Why, it's six tickets to Hootie and the Blowfish! The Blowfish!
Alright, one of you give me your underpants.
Oh! Worm medicine for the duck.
Alright.. okay. No. Give it to me.
Almost over man.
Calm down? Calm down? You set me up with the woman that I've dumped twice in the last five months!
Well maybe he was nervous.
Yeah!
All right. Now go see Miss Kitty and she'll fix you up with a nice hooker.
Okay.
Tonight? You-you didn't say it was going to be at nighttime.
We came over as soon as we saw.
Okay, it's not a check. They're saying your health insurance expired because, you didn't work enough last year.
Yeah, and someday when you're ready, you'll make it past the hedges.
Well, I was trying to prove that I was right. Y'know? And it turns out I was wrong. And now it's lodged in my throat.
Good luck.
That's it?
Yeah, and not that you would, but I wouldn't hang out with...all the guys in my office.
Ross came in forth and cried!
Uh, Julie.
So, has anyone talked to Dr. and Mrs. Geller yet?
I think I do! Thank you, Monica.
Umm, not feeling better 'bout Malcom.
No I don't! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
Honey, the tortilla chips know what you mean.
OK, now wait a minute. That is the craziest typing test I've ever seen.
Whoa!
And?
I'm tellin' you, she leaned back, I could see her brain.
I can do that, I've had 30 years of practice.
Alright, we're gettin' closer.
You didn't get more movies that are gonna have us reaching for the tissues all night did you?
I don't know, Richard's really nice and everything, uh, it's just that we don't know him really well, ya know, and plus he's, ya know, old -er than some people, but, uh, younger than some buildings.
Ho, ho, ho, holy crap is it hot in here!
I, I'm sorry, I uh I already have a roommate.
Yes.
You're naked in this picture!
What, like a number?
And yet, she's still not hanging up the phone.
Okay, but you gotta push past this because it is about to get so good!
Thank you! Thank you!
Ahh, I believe my exact words were, 'Flaign,en - sten'. I mean I didn't know what to say, how do you know if you wanna do it on an elevator?
Hi.
You'll get one.
I think I should get the chair!
That's easy, baggage claim.
Turns out he is kinda funny.
Great! Okay, here.
Pheebs, we're not giving you a deposit for our wedding!
Very informative!
Yeah, me either.
Alright, you did it! Do we have any fruit?
I see.
What a sweet story.
Okay, I'll give them back. Look! What is so great about that sandwich?
Okay, okay, a little announcement, I just want everyone to know that the position of my best man is still open! And uh, so is the position of the bride.
I've met the perfect woman. OK, we're sitting on her couch, we're fooling around, and then suddenly she turns to me and says, 'Do you ever want to do it in an elevator?'
Awesome!
No, no, no, actually losers rhyme.
Does anyone else think David Copperfield is cute?
Okay .
Okay, I'm not gonna have one.
I'm hoping that when Bob doesn't show up, she will seek comfort in the open arms of the wry stranger at the next table.
Thanks, Phoebe. But I just don't really see myself in a big white hat.
Tell her, I'm allergic, and I will sue!
Okay, now will you guys get out of here? I want this is to be a surprise and she's gonna know.
So it's pretty much the same Pheebs.
Well, I think, I think Ross knows about me and Monica.
Hello!
Okay.
Too bad, she's leaving.
What about all that "friends forever" stuff?
What?
Before or after you were shot by your own troops?
If I broke up with you, I'd miss you.
That's why for an entire year people called me Sir Limps-A-Lot?!
Nah, Nah, it's okay. I feel like I need to be in guy place. You know, do kind of like a man thing.
Oh, sure, they love us over there.
Why not?!
Hey uh, Rach, funny story. I ah, bumped into Joanna on the street yesterday.
Oh, what can happen? I mean, would you...
Well, Joey's my best friend.
Oh, listen. If this is about those prank memos, I had nothing to do with them. Really. Nothing at all. Really. Nothing.
You!
Oh, I thought that's what they used to cover Connecticut when it rained.
Picking Rachel.
Yes! Way to go, man! Still got the egg, huh?
Come on, let me see that smile.
Look what do I do? I wanna get past this, I don't wanna be afraid of the commitment thing. I wanna go through the tunnel, to the other side!
Oh, ok.
No! Shhh!
Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out.
Maybe it was his sister's. You know, maybe it was his daughter's.
Oh, you're-you're going?
What are you writing?
No! No! Not, Paris.
Okay y'know what, because you said that, I'm not putting out tonight.
It's gonna be okay, right? I mean she's not gonna leave me? This is, this is fixable.
Easy Lenny.
All right, look, if you insist on wearing that, in public, y'know, you're gonna spend the rest of the afternoon all by yourself.
Well, Monica and Chandler can't go. We're going to dinner remember?!
All right I'll have one.
Wow, it's, it's like porno for clowns.
It can't happen like this. Okay? I'll meet you back at the hotel.
I'd like to propose a toast. Little toast here, ding ding. I know this isn't the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting. Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know? So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.
I don't get it, I mean, you just got him. How can he be an adult already?
All right, we haven't had sex yet. Okay, what's the big deal? Y'know? This is special, and I want our love to grow until we move on to the next level.
Oh uh, o, OK.
I'm not gonna mess it up.
You got waaaay too much free time.
Alright, somebody kiss me. Somebody kiss me, it's midnight! Somebody kiss me!
Well, y'know, you're-you're gonna meet somebody! You're a great catch! Y'know when I was telling all those guys about you, I didn't have to lie once.
No, I'm not!
Hey!
What?
ahem... um... Crystal duck.
...The second guy.
Oh, is that against the rules?
Du-du-I wrote it, I wrote it on the board! I wrote it on the board, then I went all over New York City looking for ya! I went to Ross's! I went to the coffeehouse! I went to any place that they made sandwiches!
Well, listen, don't tell us what's gonna happen though, 'cause I like to be surprised.
I know.
OK, I don't, I don't mind the last pound. OK, in fact I kind of like the last pound. OK, so don't make me do anything that I'll regret.
All right. Look, I'm gonna go in here, and you don't buy me anything ever.
We heard you play all the way from your apartment!
Wow, this is serious. Ive never known you to pay money for any kind of capade.
Hey, buddy boy, how'd the audition go?
Yes!
Yeah but when he proposed to me with the ring I got goose bumps.
Oh, good!
Okay, I'll stop.
It's, all good! Okay bye-bye Mon! She's-she's gonna kill me.
Well, y'know, you and me, it had to end sometime.
Stop talking, stop talking now. Let me just get this straight. You're actually stealing my hat?
Funniest? Heckles?
Oh, man. In my next life, I'm coming back as a toilet brush.
Yes you did! Admit it! You freaked out!
Do we pay for this?
I'm not gonna talk to her, she obviously got my message and is choosing not to call me. Now I'm needy and snubbed. God, I miss just being needy.
Oh, that's Ross's.
No I-I-I'm fine.
Well, you're not gonna believe this, but if you have seven minutes...
Yeah, but I bet it works.
Oh, that's The Wedding March. Does, does that freak you out?
Look, uh, just come later, we'll get everything squared away and you can come back later.
Me?! Why me?
Hey! Phoebe! We can talk to Phoebe!!
Okay.
Okay, fine, $300.
Well you did pull his hair.
He's not supposed to ask my girlfriend to marry him! I'm supposed to do that!
Oh, oh, a quality, good, because I was worried you guys were gonna be vague about this.
Yeah! Totally! Totally, and you?
I'm so sorry you're sick.
It's like 'Night of the Living Dead Christmas Trees.'
Yes... thank you. That was... that was....
Yeah, all right.
You're gonna be carrying their baby and give them a Sony Play Station?
It came up.
Is this still about her whole 'The Flintstones could've really happened' thing?
Let it go!!
Someone's left a glass on the coffee table. There's no coaster. It's a cold drink, it's a hot day. Little beads of condensation are inching their way closer and closer to the surface of the wood...
Buh-bye. I just got us reservations at Michelle's and tickets to the Musicman to celebrate our first holiday season as a betroughed couple.
Listen Phoebe, he's right. People are not supposed to have heart attacks at 31.
Exactly.
I figured I'd buy those. Pat, I'd like to buy a vow.
Well, what if all my stuff was here?
Leave me alone! For the love of God, leave me alone!!!
See, you think it's just a pen, but then you turn it over and it's also a clock.
Oh yeah!
Y'know you, really didn't have to take me to the airport.
Wh-wh-why, wh-why, why, why was there kissing!? There should be no kissing!!
Who's the bitterest man in the living room, the bitterest man in the living room? Hi, neighbor.
I know!
Yeah, Joey just pressed something on the remote and it just, came on!
We have to assign heads to something.
Hey.
How is that worse?!
Okay, look I need your help, I don't know what to get her for Valentine's Day.
Drop off my dry cleaning. Pick up my vitamins. Teach me how to spell vitamins. Wear in my new jeans.
Well the duck can swim.
Yes, Fran. I know what time it is, but I'm looking at the WENUS and I'm not happy!... Oh, really, really, really? Well, let me tell you something... you will care about it, because I care about it! You got it? Good! Whooooaaaa....
...He's in.
Okay, but don't you think this is a little extreme?
Okay, come here! Come here.
Wow umm, calm down.
How do you know?!
I'm not macho.
Can I be that guy?
Phoebs, let me ask you something, were, were these, uh, funny brownies?
Joey, I saw you push him!
He's not gonna make it, he's stuck in Chicago.
No! No-no-no-no-no-no. It sounds like they really need you down there.
Joey?
Hey look, are we gonna have to bring this out every time Ross comes over?
Yeah, not bad right? You know what, Monica's gonna be working late, so I'm gonna make this place spotless. You know what else I'm gonna do, know what else I'm gonna do? I'm gonna go downstairs, I'm gonna get her some flowers. Now who wouldn't wanna live with me?
'Cause he was just so darn cute.
Oh, hey guys!
OK, I was wrong, that's what they used to cover Connecticut.
Yes. Yes!
Oh, uh, listen, about tonight...
Well, we used there's up last night making scary faces.
Because, I'm too afraid.
No, I don't see anything different other than the fact that the room got so much brighter when you came into it.
Hey, I had a terrible childhood and I don't do porn.
Well, my Grandfather was Swedish and my Grandmother was actually a tiny little bunny.
Well, those were seals, man.
So-You got in voluntarily?!
Y'know that is a popular opinion today I must say.
Yeah, you-you gotta love the talking.
Oh no-no-no-no-no-no, vomit tux! No-no, vomit tux!
No, no I only dated two girls in college, both blonde, both not attractive... Hold on one second; let me check this out. (He gets up and grabs a photo album.
Well that was before all the vaporizing action.
Okay, okay, you got it!
So I have a flaw! Big deal! Like Joey's constant knuckle-cracking isn't annoying? And Ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word? And Monica, with that snort when she laughs? I mean, what the hell is that thing? ...I accept all those flaws, why can't you accept me for this?
Batman has the Batmobile!
Okay, don't say anything, you might scare it away.
I'll hold you close in my arms. I can't resist your charms. And love....
I don't know, my mother spent most of her money on her fourth wedding. She's saving the rest for her divorce. And any extra cash my father has he saves for his yearly trips to Dollywood.
Why?
About Ross!
Whoever stood you up is a jerk.
Hi! Nice to meet you!
You do? Why?
I could die.
The only superpower you have is a slightly heightened sense of smell.
I still can't believe they promoted her to lieutenant.
Yeah?
Thank you!
Yeah that was stupid. Let's not do that.
To Put the Camera Away!!!
Whoa ho.
It's me. I'm the other guy.
Alright, hang on a second there Custer.
No I didn't!
No-no-no-no, no, it's a good thing. Why must we dial so speedily anyway? Why must we rush through life? Why can't we savor the precious moments? Those are some huge breasts you have.
Really? Right across the street?
You had to ask.
So you came to the room looking for Joey? Did you ever in-intend on telling me about this?
I'm afraid I might just be.
How is that ever going to happen?!
Buy it for ya, or win it for ya?
The one time they're not home.
What, what's what you mean?
Oh, I see. I thought you just really, really liked your new couch.
Hey.
Okay...
You have to give 'em something, you know. Okay, now that was Gerston, Santos, and who's the guy with the moustache?
All right.
Aahhuuhhh....
Well this is great! I'll give you a call! We should do it again sometime!
Okay, what do you saw I go over there and say how much I like her? No-no it'll be good, I can tell her much I've been thinking about her. That I haven't stopped thinking about her since the moment I met her. That I'm so fantastically, over-the-top, wanna-slit-my-own-throat in love with her, that for every minute of every hour of every day I can't believe my own damn bad luck that you met her first!!
Yes?
Ahh-hahaha!
I am only one man! Okay Ross, time is up!
Joey, it's been three days, okay.. Your just a little homesick, Okay. Would you just try to relax. Just, just try to enjoy yourself.
Oh my God.
Y'know what, we have to turn off the porn.
Yeah, she's dying... Of a cough apparently.
Ehh, you're just liquored up.
Hey.
Well, the heart wants what it wants. I'll see you later.
Hey, is Rachel here?
Guess who's back in show business.
Yeah, or you can do the easy thing and smoke.
Come on! Gary's such a great guy! Whatever the problem is, you can work it out!
Oh, just hanging out, talkin' about uh, websites. Yeah, we saw this really interesting website about marriage and how totally unnecessary it is and how its just a way for the government to keep tabs on you.
I think that's gum.
Ladies, ladies, let's just compromise okay? Phoebe, Rachel take off Monica's bra.
So, is Janine around?
It's gonna be ok. You know that?
I'm not moving out.
How many times have I told you guys, you never watch the cooking channel!
That's good one too, Pheebs. Now all you have to do is find a planeload of people who's resolution is to plummet to their deaths.
Fears and Pet Peeves.
Yeah?
Uh-oh, it's my boss!
The food there was, was great.
He's a he?
Can I just say one thing?
She was.... But y'know what, just in case, maybe we should come up with a set of ground rules.
Pheebs?
Hey!
Look, Joey, Kathy is clearly not fulfilling your emotional needs. But Casey, I mean granted I only saw the back of her head, but I got this sense that she's-she's smart, and funny, and gets you.
No, she's not okay? And I'll prove it to you. I'm gonna call her right now. Phone's done ehh.
Nice work my friend.
I don't know. That's the thing. I don't know what I want to do. I just know I'm not going to figure it out working there.
Oh. Nope, that patch is no good.
Okay. But it is officially nighttime.
Okay, open ours next. Open ours next!
What?!
Yeah, here, somewhere else, y'know where-where ever.
Am I naked again?!
So ah, isn't a bit cold out for shorts?
Oh fresh air!
Well yeah! But now that I know that you're having these thoughts, I'm back to panic, anxiety, and uh I'm definitely gonna need some kind of sports drink.
Well, it certainly worked for that Valdez kid.
What?
Yeah, I wanted to make a dramatic scene, but I hate packing.
Well, did-did you correct him?
You want it?
Well, couldn't we just lose our virginities again? Ya know, because I think actually mine's growing back.
Hey, I hear that you and Joshua are going out to dinner with Ross and Emily, and I think that's, I think that's really cool.
Well she's, she's the kinda girl-Joey was unconscious.
Oh, that's cool. Then I'll just bring them both over.
Oh that's great! Good for you.
Oh my God.
What?
Oh great, food with hair on it.
Y'know it's funny I started it but, now it's scary me. So could you come out here please?
Joey, this is Die Hard 1 again.
See you later Mon.
Unwilling to steal from work, interesting.
Well, not me. But that's what's happened, and, ah, and, and there's more. We should take a trip.
Hey!
Nice job Joe! You're quite the craftsmen.
So I got ya something.
No-no-no, y'know what? I really shouldn't have said that you were embarrassing me, I mean that really wasn't cool. And if it makes you feel any better, I've had a really lousy day.
Yeah, if that was true, gym class would've been a lot more interesting.
Well, I have a call in about that.
Here we go! Here we go!
Oh my God! If you say that one more time, I'm gonna break up with you!
I saw you checking me out during the game last night.
It is a crime that you and I don't spend more time together.
Laundry. Huh. Is that my new nickname?
....three years of modern dance with Twila Tharp! Five years with the American Ballet Theater?!
So--You got in voluntarily?!
Monica said wedding.
What the hell is going on?!
Yeah.
Well, you know, I appreciate you giving it a shot.
There you go! There you are!
Look there is no way you're doing this wedding now. Okay?
Thank you Rachel.
I was dangerously dehydrated during the first six months of our relationship. Look, for me the rush is knowing that we are gonna be together for the rest of our lives.
Our trains are on the same track, ok? Yeah, sure, I'm coming up 30 years behind him, but the stops are all the same. Bitter Town. Aloneville. Hermit Junction.
Okay umm, before I meant you I had really little life and I couldn't imagine growing old with...
This is nuts. This is crazy. She came over for like two minutes, dropped off a fish tank, and left, end of story.
That's why I lost my toe?! Because I called you fat?!
Much sense?!
No!
Okay we have to do something about your breath.
Yeah, all right.
Okay, hold on. Okay.
Borrow money from me?
No, interestingly enough her leaf blower picked up.
But you found me!
Umm, yeah.
Look Joe, I just, I just don't want to get your hopes up real high.
Oh no, no, no, no.
Look at this!
No!! Okay!! What's with the third degree?! Why don't you just shine a light in my eyes?!
I just think it's weird, you know? Heckles and me, Heckles, and me, me and Heckles...Would you knock it off?
Rachel, could I see you for a moment?
Oop!
No, I am.
She?
For an emergency just like this.
Hey Joe!
No-no-no-no! That was the joke!
If I turn into my parents, I'll either be an alcoholic blond chasing after twenty-year-old boys, or... I'll end up like my mom.
You just thought of that in there?
I don't know, but Donald Trump wants his blue blazer black.
Oh my God! Oh my God!
Oh yes!
Yeah, we're gonna go.
Is this a service you're providing me?
Ahh, no thanks. No chicken, bye-bye then.
What equity investments?
That's the thing, see I would like to stay in the pribe of mwha-ah-libe.
Night-night.....Janice. 'Look at all that room on her side, you good fit a giant penguin over there. That would be weird though. Okay, hug and roll time. I'm huggin', I'm huggin', your rollin', and....yes! Freedom! Except for this arm! I'm stuck. Stuck arm! Okay, time for the old table cloth trick, one fluid motion. Quick like a cat, quick like a cat! And 1...2...3!'
So, what are you doing here? I thought tonight was your big anniversary dinner.
Does it matter?!
All right, look, you're not really gonna buy that are you? Don't you think you've embarrassed me enough for one day?
Well, we're-we're hanging out in here!
If marriage worked, I'd be all for it. But do you know what the divorce rate in this country is? 97%.
Y'know, I would've bet good money that he'd be the first one of us to get married.
Count of three?
Or Casey.
Of course, of course not. I just have to uh, go over to the place where I-I made it and pick-pick it up.
No! No! I don't want him to know we're yet! I'm not sure I'm ready for that. And besides he's not gonna be too happy to see me either.
Ok, they're coming, shhh.
Yeah. Do we have any Fruit Roll-Ups?
Hi, Pheebs!
Yeah, that's when if you get the babies out by the end of the month, they give you 2% financing.
You know, I don't mean to brag, but I waited tables at Innsbruck in '76. Amouz-bouche?
Do you mind if we stick you in another cabinet? They seem all right with it!
There's a Mr. Bing!
Joey, what-wh-wh-wha-wh-wha-wh-wha-wh-wha-what are you doing here?
No, no, no, no, no!
You know, I think I might just.
Wow! Listen, we had a good run. What was it? Four? Five months? I mean, that's more than most people have in a lifetime! So, good-bye, take care, bye-bye then!
Come on. An 80-foot inflatable dog let loose over the city. How often does that happen?
What did you do when they found out?
Okay, you give the worst massages in the world.
Hey.
But we don't know the neighbors.
That's a good call. Right.
Hey, it's me.
No. No, not at all, that's-that's ridiculous.
Okay, so I guess that's about ah, two weeks before the topless thing kicks in.
Oh no-no-no, no. No, no, no, I just, I just need a pretend ticket.
Where are they? Where are they?
And the moment of joy is upon us.
Hey!
No! No! No! No--one can beat me.
Two!
Hey listen, we've gotta go, I promised Richard we'd meet him downstairs.
I think it's great. Y'know, it's sweet, it's romantic...
Oh it's always nicer to here than, "Aw crap! You again!"
What gave me away?
Yes. Okay, there's this one guy, Patrick, I think you're gonna like him, he's really nice, he's funny, he's a swimmer.
Well it's just while Monica and I were dancing to them it was...the first time I knew that...you were the woman I wanted to dance all my dances with.
Oh-oi-ho, yeah!
Bob here.
So where are we on the whole going back to the place where they have all the marriages thing? I love you.
When you're marrying us; that's what you should say.
Ross, I am not gonna run away again! I just want to get a little fresh air.
No! Uh, I d'know! The point is, if you were gonna set me up with someone, I'd like to think you'd set me up with someone like him.
Kind of? If you just kept this to yourself none of this would've happened.
Absolutely!
No, we're playing this game I learned at work. You have to name all the states in six minutes.
Run! Run you crazy, rich freak!
Hey, y'know what? I was wrong.

Yeah, we got, um-hmm.
Hey!
I wish I had smoked for my career...
She's amazing! She makes the women that I dream about look like short, fat, bald men!
Having a swim.
We wanna hear Monica's Thanksgiving story!
She is gonna recognize that I did a nice thing and-and, appreciate it.
Does this mean we're gonna have to start paying for coffee?
Do we have to make the entire thing?
Oh yeah, that looks good.
What's wrong? What's wrong? You're married that's what's wrong.
So...
I am so, so, so, so sorry!
Yeah, I think I do! Y'know what? You move in with her! You move in with her right now! Maybe I should in with Monica!
Look, Monica...
Hi! Listen, can we watch cartoons on your television? We need a porn break. We spent the last two hours watching In & Out & In, Again.
All right look, if you're not gonna stay for me, then at least stay for them! Okay, they have had a very difficult year! What with the robbery and all!
See, maybe that's the one we should've actually hidden.
OK.
In the game room!
More importantly, was I any good?
You are aware that she's not a monkey, right?
Ground control to Major Tom! Commencing countdown...engines...on!
