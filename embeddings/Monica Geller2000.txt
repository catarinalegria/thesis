Yeah, am I in it?
Hi Ben!
Stop it!! That's not funny!!
Rach, he's a friend of ours.
No, but she likes me. You abandoned her on a plane to Greece.
Well, honey, it is pretty competitive. I mean I've got an actual rocket scientist here.
That was a half an hour?
God, I'm sorry! I'll go back and get it!
I can't go to lunch!!
I do not like that woman!
Why?
You'll see.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, where are we on the hundred bucks?
That was me.
All right, fine. Tonight's potatoes will be both mashed with lumps, and in the form of tots.
I'd like a scotch on the rocks with a twist.
Phoebe?
Hey, did you pick a roommate?
I mean, all I'm asking for is just a little emotion! Is that too much to ask after six years?! I mean what? Are-are-are Rachel and I not as close as you guys?! I mean do we not have as much fun?! Don't I deserve a few tears?!! I mean we-we told Joey, he cried his eyes out!
Would you look at them?
She sent the chicken back again?!
All right. Mmm-mmm.
Chandler!!
Yes, you're having a boy!
Of course!
Is this the one that I threw out last year?
It's only been a couple of hours, so just give it some time.
It's work.
Anyway, how did it go with Kate?
Hey!
I really like to say that I'm-um... Y'know what I'd really like to say? I'm drunk!! That's right mom and dad your little Harmonica is hammered!! And guess what! I've been drunk before! And I've smoked a cigarette! And I got a box of Ding-Dongs hidden in my underwear drawer! It's all okay. It's okay because I turned thirty today. And, and I can do anything I want! Because I am a grown up.
How?
The Bible?!
Bye... bye... BIRDIE.
Well, I just think the baby would keep falling off the dog. Do you, uh, do you , do you not see kids in our future.
Sooo?
Uh, Rach... how come you have dental floss in your hair?
Lucky bastard! Janice.
And Rachel. And that's Chandler.
Ross married Rachel in Vegas! And got divorced! Again!!!!
Yeah... ..see, I was supposed to get married, but, um, I left the guy at the altar.
Yeah, no, me neither.
So I did tell you. Okay, y'know, that really isn't the thing. Umm, the thing is that, right now I'm just in a place in my life where I need to focus on me. Y'know what I mean?
It's worse. The only thing that's getting me through is knowing that I'm gonna be seeing you soon. I think I may even try to get out of here early.
My brother, the PhD would like to know if there's any way to treat this orally.
Still crying?
Okay. Four.
OK, we got the cole slaw, we got the buns...
Have you found your dress yet?
He's coming. Be cool, be cool, be cool.
Oh God, yes!
Well, you know.
Why did they get divorced?
Really! That long?! Look all you want, it's happening!
Which?
And he's a great brother!
Okay everybody, let's go! Let's go!
No!!
Yes!
You sold me out.
I knew you were likely to take a wife!
Oh yeah, I got soap and sponges and rags and Carnuba wax and polishing compound.
Edward Nevski?
Yeah! All right, maybe you don't have to smile. Let's try something else. Let's try umm, try looking sexy.
No.
I can't belive it, I'm gonna be an aunt. I'm gonna have like a nephew.
We're good.
You are?
Hey, Rach, did you make your money?
What?!
Oh, I already have one.
Okay.
Perhaps, you would like me to turn like this, so that you can bunny bump against my back.
We'll discuss it, in the morning!
Frozen lasagnas?
What?!
Ooooh! And-and-and what-what's this?
So I, I told Rachel it was just gonna be the two of us.
Was it...
All right. We're gonna go. It's not for another six hours. We're gonna go then.
Oh, just until the glue dries.
Okay, wait, you gotta hang up 'cause we're gonna be late.
Ow!!!!!!! Ow-ow-ow-ow!
Yes.
We're really sorry, but um, she did ask us first.
Oh man, they think they are so slick messing with us! But see they don't know that we know that they know! So...
Whoa!
Now there you go! I wouldn't want my best guest to strain her eyes!
Wh?! What about my allergies?!
Oh great! Did you get a movie?
What do you mean?
It's harder for me! I have those four other women to compete with!
That is a wonder. So tell me something, Mom. If you had to do it all over again, I mean, if she was here right now, would you tell her?
Wait, was this a-a small mediterranean guy with curiously intelligent good looks?
That noise you just made?
No, honey, in a wonderful way. You know what you want now. Most guys don't even have a clue. You are ready to take risks, you are ready to be vulnerable, and intimate with someone.
Hello?
Yeah, she's here. Hold on a second.
Please, it's a relief is what it is, is what it is.
Oh yeah, I remember mine! Ohh, it was my sixth birthday, my dad took me to the park, I got it, and...it bent.
Hey, I made $17 before breakfast, what have you done?
Yeah, good for you. Y'know you're tough, you lived on the streets.
No, we don't.
Hey guys!
Hi sweetie, look before I forget, did I leave my diaphram at your place? Hi mom.
I'm, I'm really sorry.
Wait. Rachel, no, he's married. Married! If you don't realise that, I can't help you.
You're kidding! Where? Where?
Okay. Well, it's good news. It's good news.
Okay, I gotta go find Rachel but umm, if you guys see her could you please try to give her some really bad news so that mine doesn't seem so bad?
So, why wait 'til Saturday, are you free tomorrow?
So anyway, I'm cooking dinner for him Monday night. You know, kind of like an audition. And Phoebe, he really wants you to be here, which will be great for me because then you can 'ooh' and 'ahh' and make yummy noises.
You bet.
It's for their own good.
Sixty guests.
That was you?
Okay! Ohhh no!
Come in! Come in! We're engaged!!!
But I figured, you know, that shouldn't change anything. I mean, what the hell does it matter how old we are.
Chandler, you're an only child, right? You don't have any of this.
Nah, I got it.
What are you guys doing here?
Okay, all right, how's this? 27. Italian-American guy. He's an actor, born in Queens. Wow, big family, seven sisters, and he's the only....boy. Oh my God, under personal comments 'New York Knicks, rule!'
Ready!
Noo!! Okay!!
I just asked you.
All right, umm, we're not gonna really keep it this way though.
Oh and you know what I want!
Come on! So she comes to the wedding! I mean it won't be so bad.
Ooh, Ugly Naked Dancing!
No.
Chandler!
What?!?!
Oh, I wish there was a job where I could wear this all the time. Maybe someday, there will be.
Did you also have his album, It's Not Easy Being Green?
Phoebe, relax none of that stuff ever happens! They just put it on there for legal reasons!
Bye.
Yeah, what is it?
They've arrested Monica.
Okay, can we change the topic? Because it's really doing nothing for me.
'Cause I don't want to encourage this kind of behaviour.
No-no, don't-don't-don't do it!
Well you let me know if you can, because y'know I can bake a pie to cover it.
Hey.
Joey!
Aww, the only reason you want to go out with me because my blond wig, and the big boobs, and the fact that I serve you food.
Why not?
Okay!
Well, maybe you're right-She made fun of my phone pen!
I do.
Chandler, for so long I...I wondered if I would ever find my prince, my soul mate. Then three years ago, at another wedding I turned to a friend for comfort. And in stead, I found everything that I'd ever been looking for my whole life. And now...here we are...with our future before us...and I only want to spend it with you, my prince, my soul mate, my friend. Unless you don't want to. You go!
Yeah, you have to go fight for her!
Yep! You got the tickets?
How 'bout one last game of racquetball?
What?!
That's the surprise!
Okay!
Okay, those people just left, come on! Quick! Give him the money and get their table!
That cold makes you sound so great.
What?!
Can you blame him?
What are you doing here? You can't be here!
So what're you gonna do?
She picked Rachel. I mean, she tried to back out of it, but it was obvious. She picked Rachel.
Thanks.
Yeah-yeah, you remember how I call you bunny?
So?!
Aaahhhhhhh! Aaahhhh!
Anything but stew.
I don't know! I don't-maybe you're feeling a little resentful. Maybe ah, maybe you thought you'd get married first! Maybe you can't stand the fact that your formally fat friend is getting married before you!
Yesss!!
Chandler, listen to me sweetie, I know you can do this. Okay? You have a beautiful smile.
Honey, you made the bed again. I told you, you don't have to do that. This isn't camp.
Phoebe!
Of course.
It's no big deal, I do it all the time.
Come on!
I know.
What're you gonna do?
Hah, no no no no no no no no no no.
All right, get your coat, we're going to the hospital.
Y'know what really bothers me? Is-it's how-how different you act around them! I mean y'know the throwing the tennis games, the fake laugh, the "I'll see you around, Bing!" "Not if I see you first, Doug!" I gotta tell you, I don't like Work Chandler. Okay? The guy's a suck-up.
This totally makes sense!
That's good, have a seat. Um, the doctor says it's gotta be a needle. You're just gonna have to be brave, ok? Can you do that for me?
Oh my God!
You know, that's true. You'd be a great person to have around the day after an emergency.
I just don't think arcade games go in the beautiful guest room. The beautiful guest room is gonna be filled with antiques.
Would you look at them. Am I ever gonna find a boyfriend again? I gonna die an old maid.
But, I just cleaned the bathroom.
Oh. Can I have a tissue?
Now, are you glad we didn't start with the bikini strips?
Really?!
Okay. Don't you want a cookie?
Over here dad.
See, didn't I tell you?! You're getting over Ross already!
Count in our heads as-as good Madlibs.
Well then get it, get it!
No. I hate this part.
Hey.
Gin.
What did you tell them?
What?
Yeah, apparently, they're pretty good seats.
I can't believe this! This is like the worst night ever!
That's that weird voice again.
So, should I call him back?
So then, are you going to dump Jason?
Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't do this.
I know. Thanks.
Those cute little black ones I wear all the time.
No, I will not cave.
And the way she slaps all the time!
We forgot to sign one of the admissions forms.
How, how did that happen?
I will! But not tonight. For dinner music, I thought we could listen to that tape you made me.
I just told my Mom I'd cater a party for her.
Okay listen, y'know when you move in Rachel's room is gonna be empty, you wanna talk about what we want to do with it?
Oh.
Well then, y'know what? I care about you to much to watch you hurt yourself like this. So if you have to do this, then you're gonna have to do it without me.
Okay, here's your penis!
All right, Rachel, I know-I know you think I'm crazy, please, before you tell him you love him, just-just try to find one person who thinks this is a good idea. Because I bet you, you can't.
And you're cute too.
I know! I know! I know!
All right, that's it. You know what? Just get out of my way and stop moping.
It's my New Year's resolution!
Ha, ha, very funny, very funny. But I think we'd like to give poker another try. Shall we, ladies?
Yeah baby!
Really? Who's number two?
Ohh.
All right, I definitely taste nutmeg.
Oh that's cute! We really all enjoyed it. But y'know, it doesn't count.
Nope. Going to the Big Apple Circus today.
See now-now you're taking them away from their home.
What?!! What?
I think it's a great idea. Yeah, we could have a dinner party and just invite her close friends.
Then I won't have to kill you.
Oh my God! What were you doing in a library?
You came?!
Ooh, umm, oh Kathy! Kathy, I love you! Oh!
That's sounds great, but how are you going to afford it?
Ross isn't here.
Rachel! Rachel! You haven't touched Eldad's hair!
Okay, one more, please. Come on, I'm gonna get it in this time, I will.
Jellyfish sting! Oh, it hurts! It hurts!! It hurts!!
Hey. Call me when you get there. Okay?
Ok, um, I'll go with you.
I got it!!
Okay, let's go!! Let's hit the road!!
Yeah, right.
No time for that!
You know the words! You are so into this!
I know.
What are you talking about?
Don't stare. Now she just finished throwing his clothes off the balcony, now there's just a lot of gesturing and arm-waving, , Ok, that is either, "How could you?" or, "Enormous breasts!" Here he comes!
Hey Joey! Isn't that the girl that waved at you the other day?
Yeah. It's Dutch.
Wait, you can't have the baby here! I mean I haven't sterilised it since the guys moved out!
I am not.
Now, open your eyes.
There was nudity!
So, did I hear Poconos?
I'm sorry, but that's my happy place.
Ohhh! What are you doing to me?! Oh look, I-I... I'm sorry but umm, this-this-this-this is not going to happen.
Y'know, Joey, I think it's time to give up the bag.
I know that switch does something, okay? So-so I went down to city hall and got these. All I had to do was pay $25 and wait in line for three hours.
I hope you're hungry, we're starting with oysters. And y'know what they say about oysters, don't you?
We're kidding!
Hey there.
I know! I'll tell you something, we are gonna do that again!
I'm just so excited to make the presents! Shoot!
Sure.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Phoebe. It's just a little shorter than what we had discussed.
Yeah, Chandler... you've been there for five years.
Do you realize that four weeks from today we're getting married? Four weeks baby!! Four weeks!!!
Yes Phoebe, but this is all I have. Okay?
You do?
Maybe a Hello Kitty doll, the ability to walk...
Awww, come on-wait-stop it. Okay, to Monica.
You're still gonna pay me, right? Or something a little less selfish.
Hi.
Because he'll know what to do? Oh my God, you're a genius!
Oh, thank you!
Okay, let's do it. Mom and Dad are gonna be so faced!
Yeah?
He's a dropper!
Remember that guy from cooking school I told you about that put cilantro with everything?
You need to give him money.
Ohhh, Chandler, sorry! Hey, Janice.
Oh, just some pictures I made and hung up. I thought they'd brighten up the place. They do don't you think?
That's not true, you don't have a moustache.
Oh, um, that was my bathing suit from high school. I was uh, a little bigger then.
Why are so mad at him?
Guys, you got your hair cut.
My boyfriend said he didn't like my massages.
What do you mean?
I can't believe you did that.
Well, are you asleep right now, Joe? 'Cause I don't think you have to wear it unless you are!
Oh God.
No way!
Yes, I did! And you are welcome!
I know being spit on is probably not what you need right now. Um... how long?
They're green?
Okay, I'm not getting this!
Hey!
Well, we-we had to go back because I forget my jacket.
Yeah, we all have jobs. See, that's how we buy stuff.
What's 'pleh'?
Phoebe and Gary are so gonna hear about this at dinner.
Yeah, I'll have a scotch...
Well, Rachel wants to take swing dance lessons. Which I think is a really stupid idea! It's dangerous, she's never gonna get what she wants, and who knows who she might end up hurting.
I'll pick it up for you!
Hi!
Chandler, wh-why don't we sit down?
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god!
Oh, there's banana on it.
Hey! How did it go with Elizabeth?
See? They're as different as night and... later that night.
Enough!
Go on.
Well, what kind of food is he looking for?
Me going out with Richard's son.
Get up. Come on. Let's get some coffee.
All right, I'm gonna go steam my wedding dress okay? Who wants the responsibility of making sure nothing happens to it?
Relax! You'll be fine. Oh much better. You're invisible now.
I'm not a baby, you're the baby.
What's so funny?
Wait! Wait! Wait! You can't start today! Today's the rehearsal dinner!
But I'm...
Okay. I'm guessing that if you don't want to deliver, you probably don't want to pick stuff up either.
Okay, I'd like to know how much the room was because I'd like to pay my half.
Oh, she was a cruel, cranky, old bitch! And I'm sorry she died. Did Dad say I get the dollhouse?
Ow!
Hey.
Hi Chandler.
Yes! Carol and Susan's caterer had a mountain bike accident this weekend, and she's in a full body cast.
Huh?
Okay, Joey's gonna catch it, and you and I are gonna block.
See he's nice. Right?
Come on! Come on! Hurry! We're running out of time! Huddle up!
Thank you.
No, I don't even know how serious he is about me. Until I do, I'm not telling them anything.
Are you sure?
Oh my god, Joey, for all we know this guy could be horribly...
Okay.
'Cause if you do that means you'd be cancelling it for me, and we're just friends.
Umm. Umm. Umm. I don't think so.
All right.
I won the game.
Hey!
Why do you care so much anyway?
Sorry, Rach.
Well... That's not the only time this was an issue. You remember when umm, you spent Thanksgiving with us? You called me fat.
I want a baby.
Hey.
And so, we're hiding in the bathroom.
Yeah, yeah.
Oh, Phoebe, she couldn't stop crying! With those thick glasses, her tears looked giant.
Give me that!
I promise you, next time I will absolutely tell you.
I'm sorry.
I'll meet you there in two minutes.
Barry who you almost...?
And then Chandler was, was really sweet and he consoled me. And well we drank too much...
What are peanut butter fingers?!
Okay, I will. Remember that thing that we just discussed that you wanted to do?
'I drink tea.'
Where are you guys going? Come on, one more game!
Are you sure?
Ok, thanks for coming, I hope you guys had fun.
You go girl. I can't pull that off can I?
I'm sorry, okay? It just-tonight was supposed to be y'know, it was supposed to be a big deal.
Chandler!
All right uh, the important thing is to take your time, you want to hit 'em all, and you mix 'em up. You gotta keep them on their toes.
Yeah. I hope she can kick his ass.
You become friends after?
How could I be asleep knowing that you were in the next room.
Okay, in we go.
Aww...
Oh.
Hey, it's Phoebe and Rachel. Um, why don't you tell them what you were telling me earlier about me not being high maintenance?
This is so cool, maybe this is something you can do every week.
Yes.
Stop!
All right, he's keys are in the drawer. Y'know what? I also need some cash.
Honey! Dinner's ready!
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.
Do you want our guy to be your guy?
So, why don't you just take it back to where you got it?
Did you two...
Oh yeah? When?
No, it doesn't, does it? But you wanted lumps, Ross? Well, here you go, buddy, ya got one.
Yeah. We-we had sex and then we fell asleep.
I see pizza!
All right, just give it back to me when your done. See you guys.
We had a characturist!
Oh, I know, I never wear fake ones. I just did it so my Mom wouldn't give me grief about me biting them.
No, my eye doctor is Richard! I can't go to him when I don't have a boyfriend!
You did it! You got ordained?!
Okay, come on, do it one more time!
Oh, so there is gonna be a fifth date?
Still smoking cigars?
Something wrong?
What?
Ahhh, hey honey? Don't you have to be at your interview now?
Hi!
Mrs. Bing? Here, these are my parents umm, Judy and Jack Geller.
The wedding is off, sloppy and immature!
I am, aren't I?
Okay, we're gonna need a distraction.
A-ha!!!
Freemont. West-Westmont, ah Westburg?
Chandler! You don't have to ask for my permission. You can go.
Oh umm, that's because I just wanted to y'know walk in on me and Chandler while we were, y'know, doing it all night. Will you excuse me for just a second?
Chandler there's nothing wrong with crying! I mean you don't have to be so macho all the time.
No.
Hello, Mr. Heckles.
Bodington's!
Okay, I think that's it. The seating chart is done. This is our wedding. They all look like they're having fun don't they?
Honey, I'm sorry.
You have to go to London!
No, sweetie, I-I trust you.
I never knew that either.
Who has her own little desk when Roland's not there.
My God, I can't believe this! I mean I knew that mom and dad were invited, but I thought that was it! I mean from the ages 7 to 9 Frannie and I were inseparable!
What are you talking about? If you get married in Vegas you're married everywhere.
Who? I mean have you seen a car come by here in the last hour and a half? I think we should call Ross, maybe he can get a car and come pick us up.
Oh come on! You're making it sound worse than it actually was.
Hey!
No.
Hey, you know I got a question for ya. Just a little thing, no pressure.
Oh, you mean like that guy thing where you act mean and distant until you get us to break up with you.
Hmm.
You are going to make a joke about my special present! Why would you do that?!
No, just a Friday night.
I like them a lot.
They want me to do it, which is really cool, seeing as I've never catered before, and I really need the money, and this isn't a problem for you, is it?
No, although now that's what I'm thinking.
Oh.
Oh, I-I don't know.
Oh my god.
Third door on the left.
Please! I made this game what it is.
You guys are always hanging out in my apartment! Come on, I'll only use my left hand, huh? Come on, wussies! All right, ok, I gotta go. I'm going, and I'm gone.
'I am Bea.'
Hey!
Where ya going?
In the bank.
That you're a liar.
Sweetie! Edges! Fingers! Smudgey! Pictures!
Well, I was going for wrong, but we can use your word.
You promised Dr. Weinburg, you'd never use that phrase.
Yeah.
Oh, it was great! The widow wouldn't pay, so Phoebe yelled at her 'til she did.
Shhhh!!!
What?!
Burning's good.
Rose Marie really belongs on a smaller screen, doesn't she?
Pretty much.
Well, you're-you're sweating.
I like 'em.
Hey.
All right then. Bye.
Since we've been going out, I think I've mentioned his name twice!
Yes, we are.
Probably some y'know, European good-bye thing he picked up in London.
I can't believe this, just like 2 weeks ago I was watching Sudden Death, now I'm on a date with Jean-Claude Van Damme. Can you beat up that guy? Can you beat up that guy?
Did you ever go out with a guy your friends all really like?
Those are my eyes! Those are my breasts.
You can not play bagpipes at the wedding!!
Well, my financially challenged friends, I split my money and I bought some shares of CHP and ZXY.
Oh.
I still say that if we had called your dad we coulda gotten better seats.
Done?
Why is Ross naked?
All right people, we're in trouble here. We've only got 12 hours and 36 minutes left. Move, move, move!
Do you really want to pull at that thread?
Hi...May I help you?
What did they do to you?
Yeah, I think that fifth shower actually got the interview off me.
Yeah, I don't hear Chandler's and he doesn't hear mine.
Damnit Ross, get your butt out of the bathroom.
Phoebe why don't you just call her? You obviously want to.
Jeffery.
Oh, good.
Yeah, I'd say so. And there's no 'j' in 'engorged'.
You didn't find her?
I can cook and you can take care of the money.
You really think that'll work?
Um, okay, here it goes. I'm not 22. I'm, I'm 25... and thirteen months.
Anyway um, when he left he forgot to take the poem with him. Now, I am like totally dense about poetry, but I think it's pretty good all right. Check it out.
Well, then, I'm okay with being high maintenance.
No! Rachel, you didn't find anyone so you can't tell him.
Really?
Just be yourself. But, not too much.
Your boyfriend has been in there for over an hour. I can't believe it, it's like I'm living with him again. He's here when I go to sleep, he's here when I wake up, he's here when I want to use the shower, ughh. It's like I'm sixteen all over again .
Ugh! Well, y'know, we were away...
Rachel, I have not missed one question the whole game. I own this game! Look at my hand.
Uff.
Love is the best medicine.
Hey.
Oh my God, what are you gonna do?!
Chandler, what are you doing? That thing can put someone's eye out!
Ok, well, what kind of ritual?
Okay. That was her right?
And ice!
Wow!
I'm sorry honey.
I think so too.
I'm so sorry. Please, stop freaking out.
No!
That's right.
Really?
Chandler!!
Honey, that's a great idea nailing the boxes to the floor!
Does he not make enough money?
Um-hmm.
My brother, Ross.
I need two. I'm bringing Pete. My boyfriend. I have a boyfriend now!
Okay, the red ones are my guests and the blue ones are yours.
I'm fine-d. I'm fine-d! Y'know, it's a really hard word to say.
Oww!
I'll get it.
Thank you Joey, thank you so much!
That's okay, this is more important than fruit on my ceiling! You broke up?!
Well, go over to her! She's not with anyone.
Hey Ross! So, I was checking out the uh, real estate section...
Hey, look at me. I'm making jam, been at it since 4 o'clock this morning.
It's the heat. And-and the humidity.
Honey, I just don't think that you understood the joke.
Oh God... Why don't they put chairs back here?!
Alright, I'll give you the ear thing but don't you think the ending was pretty wonderful?
I have no moves. Okay, whatcha doin' there?! Oh y'know what? I'm sorry, this is just too weird.
Harder than it sounds. Isn't it?
You're right. I mean I'm sorry. Yeah, I shouldn't be laughing. I should be laying down papers for you!
Look at these authentic fake medals. I tell ya, mom's gonna be voted best dressed at the make-believe military academy.
He took my snack!
We'll see.
I-I already told him everything! You shush!!
Carol moved her stuff out today.
He's in a different room! He's really that loud?
Y'know what? I'll think you'll play.
Ethan, it's um... it's icky.
That's insurance fraud.
There's an ad for a naked chef?
Duh-huh!
You know!
Paolo, I really hate you for what you did to Rachel, but I still have five of these, so heat it at 375 until the cheese bubbles.
No.
What's going on here? You go out with tons of girls.
Great!
Mine? Right here?
You'll do what?
Well, I guess we've established who's staying here with Monica...
Keep going.
A monkey. Have you seen a monkey?
Yeah.
Or 45.
Hi. Hi, uh, yes, this is Monica Geller. Um, I believe I'm taking some classes with you and I was wondering what they were.
Hi! Hey, Pete you're back! Hey, check this out.
Of course! Joey wouldn't let you have one?
Michael.
Oh, you're right.
Hello.
Ditch you? Phoebe, you were pregnant with the triplets!
Relax, she-she's gonna give in way before you do!
STOP IT!! ...Oh my God. It's true! Who am I?
Uh-oh, what's the matter?
Oh no, two days, you must be bummed.
Hey, Rach, can I borrow your eyelash curler, I think I lost mine.
Hello, people who do not live here.
Vomit tux? Who vomited on-y'know what, what you up to Joe?
Y'know, maybe it's best that we never got to do it again.
No, it was Ginger. I remember, because when he told me, I said, 'the movie star.'
I know, I know. I'm just so tired of-of missing him. I'm tired of wondering why hasn't he called. Why hasn't he called!
You were staring about eight inches south of there.
Oh, some idiot customer put a suggestion in the suggestion box.
No-no, it's not okay! It's not! I mean you were just... You're so incredible! You went through all this time and effort to make this tape for me! Y'know I'm just gonna-I, I am gonna make this up to you! I will! I-I am going to cook anything you want in here , and I am going to do anything you want in there!
Dead leg!!
Alright, here we go. We've got salmon roulettes and assorted crudites.
Oh, good.
Rach, you're in a great place in your life. Come on, you've got a great job! Good friends...
Oh yeah? When?
But Phoebe, you can go out with a creepy guy any night of the year. I know I do.
Oh, why does this bother me so much? I mean I don't wanna be one of those people who tells their boyfriend they wanna spend 24 hours a day with them.
What if I asked?
How-how are you, Mom?
Hey guys.
It's so good, isn't it?
Alright, check.
Yeah.
You got it from Pottery Barn?!
Okay! But you can't rip it. Well, maybe a little.
It is not over! You're over!
Really? Your work laugh?
Oh, then bring it on! Oh, unless of course your afraid you might lose to a bunch of girls.
Come on, we can't let them win!
Yeah, tacos! Ever since you told me that story I've had such a craving for them.
Joey, I'm in!
Then you'd be going back and forth all the time, I mean it doesn't make any sense.
You know, if you just wait another... six and a half minutes...
How hammered are you? Huh? These, these are Joey's sisters.
It was a project for one of the Home Ec classes.
Okay, Chandler, you go first.
To score the winning touchdown, by the way.
Pete! Pete!! That guy's pretty huge!
Hell, I wanna see Joey.
Because... I'm Monica Geller. It was my credit card you were using.
Right.
And who pays for that?
The waiter carried the breadsticks in his pants!
We thought since Phoebe was staying over tonight we'd have kinda like a slumber party thing. We got some trashy magazines, we got cookie dough, we got Twister...
Uh, wait, backstage?
Ok. Oh boy. You are doin' so good. You wanna squeeze my hand? All right, Ross, don't squeeze it so hard. Honey, really, don't squeeze it so hard! Oh, Ross! Let go of my hand!
You're right, I'm sorry. It's not like you're y'know, going out with an ex-girlfriend.
Really?
No. He's not a horrible guy.
Hey!
Hey!
Not everybody's happy. Hey Bobby!
Absolutely.
Phoebe, you have to lift it and point.
I don't know. I guess the other people just don't care enough.
What was her name?
Okay. Umm...
Yay!
Would you just open it?
All right. But umm, I-I-I'll pay you back all the money you invested, and you can keep the van.
Two it is. Ok, time for bed, I'm gonna go brush my teeth.
No one.
We said six!
I won't give you anything, but you'll owe me 2.95.
Okay, all right don't judge me to much. Okay? Um, but I saw this info-mercial, and um, I swear to you I have never-ever bought anything on TV before, except for this mop. But there was this stuff on leg waxing, it just, it looked so amazing....
Can you believe it? ...Y'know what? I just don't feel the thing. I mean, they feel the thing, I don't feel the thing.
Why would the little girl creep you out?
Anybody lose this?
Joey... we always know what you mean.
Hi. Uh, you... you don't know me, I'm Monica Geller... Ross's sister.
No kidding, out of towners huh? What did you tell 'em?
No, the one who looked at you once because you got in her way.
Y'know what? I am really tired of your bellyaching! Okay, I-I worked really hard at making this a nice place for us to live!
Nothing.
No Phoebe, those are like the side affects and stuff.
Well, I-I-there was this guy at the bank that I thought was cute umm, but I don't anymore.
Really? Weird. Anyway, see, I planned everything really well. I planned and I planned and I planned. It just turns out, I don't think I planned enough time to actually do it.
Hello? Oh, Hi, Ju Hi, Jew! Uh huh? Uh huh? Ok. Um, sure, that'd be great. See ya then. Bye.
Oh my God! Rachel!! You look terrific!
You wanted it to be a surprise.
Oh, hang on, hang on. Does Aunt Monica get a say in this?
Ross.
Wait a minute, I can get ice at the restaurant...
Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please?
I'm engaged!!!!!! I'm engaged!!!!
'....Won't you, won't you, won't you.... '
You should feel great about yourself! You're doing this amazing independence thing!
Are you sure this time?
Great.
Why would you do that?
How?
My parents spent the money for our wedding!
Ok, these were unbelievably expensive, and I know he's gonna grow out of them in like, 20 minutes, but I couldn't resist.
Are we playing football or what? Come on you hairy-backed Marries.
Aww, man!
Umm, you've got some on your pants.
I lost our mattresses.
Alright, go on.
Oh no it's not, no it's not. It's a first date. I'm sure that nothing is gonna...
All right, what about the third guy?
Alright, you see these little flower blossoms? They should be facing up, not down, because, well, the head of the bed is where the sun would be. You don't love me any more do you.
Chandler?
Ok, the first person's most embarassing memory is, 'Monica, your party sucks.' Very funny.
Oh, we used to drive each other crazy playing the shadow game.
Yeah.
Well, apparently she does.
Alright, but I'm very excited about this OK, so you gotta promise you won't get all big-brothery and judgmental.
I think it's romantic.
She was like 30, dark hair, attractive.
Don't come in here!
Joey, do you work here?
Morning.
I swear I've seen birds do this on Wild Kingdom.
I would love too, but I can't! I mean I just can't, you know that I'm not good at confrontation.
Hi.
You're right.
Who are they killing off?
Well, that's different. My lie didn't make one of us a felon in 48 states. What were you thinking?
Well I think the length of teasing is directly related to how insane you were so, a long time.
Oh, that's Nana, right there in the middle. 'Me and the gang at Java Joe's'.
The woman that got married a bunch of times and killed herself when you were 13?
Let me try.
All right relax Mr. I've Had Sex Four Times!
Me? What are you talking about? Nobody could steal me from you. I mean, just because I'm friends with her doesn't make me any less friends with you. I mean, you're my...We're, we're...Oh, I love you.
Ahh, Pete, the other day when you said you needed to talk, umm, just so I know, is it good news or bad news.
A wuss? Excuse me for living in the real world, okay?
Yeah, sure.
Who?
The park huh? A public place.
Yes! Have you seen it?
No! But because he thought I was to faaaaa.... And every time I think about it, it makes me feel as bad as I did in fifth grade! Y'know, I-I really think that you should apologize to Julie.
All right, so what do you say?
Hey, what's up?
Wow, all you need now is The Killing Fields and some guacamole and you've got yourself a part-ay.
Is someone there?
You've got to be smooth about it.
What is wrong with this freezer?! Ow! Ow!!
Hey Rach, could you get me some cough drops?
Rachel! That was a library card!
Ross, the heat!
Hi, again.
Mr. Heckles.
Say you're sorry.
Okay, but all right you're a guy, does it not freak you that you're never gonna sleep with anybody else?
Yeah, it's good.
Oh I can't. Dr. Roger is coming over again.
So we're back on?
Stop with the broom, we're not making noise.
Hey, I went up.
Are you okay?
Mira, Ross, Marcel se llevo el control remoto.
Please.
Y'know, I don't like to brag about it, but I give the best massages!
Blow drying what, you have no hair.
Thank you soo, much.
And I would have to say pah-huh.
Jody!
So, what are you saying now?
I wish we at least knew his name... Look at that face. I mean, even sleeping, he looks smart. I bet he's a lawyer.
Wait Chandler, what are you doing?!
What were we thinking?
So umm, how was your date with Ginger?
Wait! What about Joey?
I made you a surprise.
All right, I'll do it just this once! But you can't tell anybody!
Oh.... my... God.
Thanks. I'll call you tomorrow. Okay. Okay, let's let the Alan-bashing begin. Who's gonna take the first shot, hmm?
So, what's this.
Really? Wow! It looks like I had some trouble staying inside the lines.
I don't need an actual man, just a couple of his best swimmers. And there, there are places you can go to get that stuff.
You know what? This has been kind of a girlie day. You're right, I'm sorry.
Why? Do you have a report due?
Ross, he's got the remote again.
Oh please, you just want more blue pins.
Ross, that is gorgeous!
Just go get some! Go!
You'll vamp?!
How can you not remember? You made us call you...Bea.
Noo!!
Do you want to go out on a date with her?
Tonight you're supposed to waitress for me, my catering thing, any of those words trigger anything for you?
Hey, you guys.
Ross.
It's on us, all right, so don't worry. It's our treat.
Yes.
Look at it! Ohhh! Wallpaper's a little faded, that's okay. Carpet's a little loose. Hardwood floors!!
Rachel, it's a world where Joey is a neuro-surgeon.
I wanna buy 5 shares of SGJ and I wanna buy them now. C'mon time is money my friend. Thank you. Wooo.
Sometimes I have bad dreams.
Why? 'Cause otherwise you'd go for it?
All right. When is, when is the next flight out?
Well what are you gonna do when he finds out he wasn't even asked?!
Uh-hmm.
Fair? Please don't even talk to me about fair! Fair would've been you wanting to marry me back then! Or fair would've been Chandler wanting to marry me now! Believe me, nothing about this is fair! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing!
Who's Denise?
All right, I'm gonna show you something a lot of guys don't know. Rach, give me that pad, please? All right. Now...
Because that's where the party is you goon. See this is just the staging area.
No! To take more pictures of all of us together. I mean I really think it's the best resolution because everyone will enjoy the pictures.
Oh look, the pool table's free. Rack 'em up. I'll be back in just a minute. Get ready for me to whip your butt.
What?!
The oven is on.
Oh, you're breaking up with Tony?
Come in! Come in! We're engaged!!!
I'll get everybody else , finally we can start celebrating my- I'm sorry, uh apparently I've opened the door to the past.
Hi, Ben. Hi. I'm your Aunt Monica. Yes I am. I'm your Aunt Monica. I...I will always have gum.
Nooo!
That's Bill Clinton.
What if I turn out the lights?
No! No, she doesn't. Uh Phoebe, what she makes-that's uh-they're sock rabbits. They are completely different-Okay! Okay! Okay! I didn't make it! I'm sorry! I totally forgot about tonight and the fact that we're supposed to make the presents!
Hi.
Oh my.
Uh, no. Loosely translated 'We should do this again' means 'You will never see me naked'.
Wait-wait, guys! If-if we follow the rules, it's still fun and it means something!
Wow! I can't believe I actually rolled an eight.
Hey!
So, are you ready to go?
What?
Really?!
Hi Chandler.
What you guys don't understand is, for us, kissing is as important as any part of it.
Hi, honey.
A small puff of air, now come on!
I know. Let's try a look...of far off...wonderment. Okay, we'll-we'll gaze into our future and we'll think about our marriage and the days to come. Chandler! What is the matter with your face?! I mean this picture is supposed to say "Geller and Bing to be married," not "Local woman saves drowning moron!" Hey! Don't laugh at him! He's my drowning moron!
Well, she was shocked when I told her, but then again so were most people.
How can I not do it? I have $127 in the bank.
Okay great!
I'm Monica. I'm disgusting. I stalk guys and keep their underpants.
I guess that's how.
No.
We heard about your pants, I'm so sorry.
Thanks, I'm set. Do you still live with your parents?
Oh, I think so.
You're right. I'm sorry. I should've told you.
Don't get too attached, she's having it cremated.
Y'know what, I'm gonna hold her head.
Don't say it!
No, it's more like a good luck.
No! No!
Oh yeah. Definitely.
Ohh!
Forget it.
How many perfectly fine women are you gonna reject over the most superficial insignificant things?
Ross, you were right before, it was just a stupid fight about a room.
Fair enough, now go get ready!
And you know what? We want a rematch.
And then we're gonna have a little Middle Eastern cous-cous. Something we can eat, with our hands.
Yeah, just like the one in the poem.
Wouldn't you be?
Awww, look at Aunt Monica's little boy!
What are we gonna do?
Yes!!
Hey!
Are you okay?
We have a ladle.
Wow! For just a week you guys are really close, huh?
Chris says they're closing down the bar.
Yeah, I think you should keep looking!
Oh wait! You didn't just sit on my Kit-Kats did you?!!
I've never loved anybody as much as I love you.
All right!! All right. I got stung. Stung bad. I couldn't stand. I-I couldn't walk.
Uh, no!!
Did you eat all the neighbor candy?!
Honey! Do you know that none of that stuff came from me?! I mean I never said I wanted to have babies and get married right now!
I know!!!
A jazz trio for cocktails. The Bay City Rollers for dancing. Wait, that was from my sixth grade wedding.
Yeah. And y'know, if you wanna cry, that's okay too.
Yeah! And the winner gets a hundred bucks.
What? I'm just said.
Who's Mr. Girabaldi?
What's to know? Buy sell, high low, bears bulls... Yes Manhattan...yeah telephone number of the stock...selling store.
You okay?
Cut it out.
Okay, great! Bye. So guess who's coming to Thanksgiving dinner?
I mean this has been like my dream since I got my first Easy Bake Oven and opened Easy Monica's Bakery. I mean I would kill for this job. I mean I can totally do this job, and God knows I paid my dues. But Pete's just doing this because he has a crush on me.
I know! And four ninety-nine for a pillow top queen set, who cares about the divorce, those babies will sell themselves. And I'm appalled for you by the way.
I blame London.
Uh huh.
Ok, I'll tell you what. How about I cook dinner at my place? I'll make it just like Mom's.
Really?
I don't want a ghost.
Ohh my God, I'm so sorry.
Okay, I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I-I-I was um, I was taking a nap.
Happy birthday dad.
Oh my God, Rachel! Hi!
How ya feelin'?
What?! Ross y'know this isn't even about you! I mean this is about Rachel and something wonderful happening for her. I mean you know even if you're right, what if he wants to sleep with her, does it mean he gets too?
I'm fine now, but it was really scary there for a while. I mean, someone slipped a-a threatening note under the door.
Well I didn't want everyone to think I was stupid.
Oh.
Me too.
Why?!
Who is this?
Oh. Well then way to go you big movie star!
Oh, no thanks, we're just here to observe.
Rachel, what's going on? I mean isn't this the same Barry who you left at the altar?
Wow! That guy is so rude!
That's ok. I'm sorry I poisoned you.
You know that? You don't want to spoil your appetite.
Okay! Okay, let's race! First one there wins! Ha-ha!
I know! It's just that...ever since high school Rachel was the one person I told everything too. Y'know? I miss that so much now. She's my best friend.
The fake kind!
Now, Mom, everything's going fine, really. Yeah, Ross is great. He's uh, he's in a whole other place. No, he's gone. No no, you don't have to fly back, really. What do you mean this might be your only chance? Would you stop? I'm only 26, I'm not even thinking about babies yet.
In...in two weeks.
Y'know what, you can play with my dollhouse.
Oh, Candy! She was so spunky!
Sorry! I'm just-I'm not very good at this! I'm a terrible liar and I hate having to lie to Rachel!
I know! Hey, how's Chandler doin'?
I'll be coordinator! Oh my God! I'm so sorry, I didn't get you anything! Okay, look everybody has to help! Okay? You can help, can't you Phoebe?
Rach, there's something uh, important I have to tell you.
You touch people's eyeballs every day and this feels weird.
Okay.
Oh my God! Oh my God!
Yeah, yeah, it's interesting.. but y'know what? Just for fun, let's see what it looked like in the old spot. Alright, just to compare. Let's see. Well, it looks good there too. Let's just leave it there for a while.
No-no, wait! Just let me finish, okay? This isn't something that we just, we just impulsively decided in-in Vegas, this is something we both really want. And it is going to happen.
There's nothing we can do. You erased the message!
Well, umm, Walker was looking for this big bus load of kids.... All right, I get your point.
Phoebe that's crazy!
No Chandler no! No unscheduled stops. You can go when we stop for gas.
Ross will do it.
Yes it is! You saw me wearing it!
Yes! We found you a really cute and funny guy from Chandler's work!
Oh shut up!
Yes that would be lovely.
What is it?! What about Pete?
I called him.
Wow! So, now you're going on a date with this girl?
Mom! Dad! Ross smoked pot in college!
Well thank God you were here! I mean, we have to erase that!
Chandler, nobody likes breaking up with someone. You just gotta do it.
I can not see him? I mean, you can't tell me what to do!
Weren't you asked to leave sonny?
With that moustache doesn't Chandler remind you of Aunt Sylvia?
'Scuse me?
I thought there wasn't a ball?
So the wedding caterer sent me this list of twelve appetizers and I have to narrow it down to six.
Cause I already invited her.
It's okay. It's okay. Just pretend that it didn't happen! Okay? No one needs to know! I mean, Phoebe's not an official ballplayer! I mean, only official ballplayers can drop the ball!
Not now, I'm sick!
Wait a minute, why don't you just call Mark. I mean, who says you have to sit here and wait for him, you've got to make stuff happen.
Hey.
Yes you did. You absolutely sold me...
Why would they think they're invited?
What?!
What these? Oh, these are, um, for.. cuts and scrapes.
Do you think things would have been better if you'd just told her the truth?
What if it's new? I mean, we agreed not to talk again, unless we had something really important to say. Shouldn't I call him back?
Oh my God!
Yes. I hated you. I mean I, I, loved you in a 'you're my brother so I have to' kind of way, but basically, yeah, I hated your guts.
Oh, my pleasure.
Thanks. Like, check out my new catering stuff. Look at this! I'm an omelet station! Omelet? Made to order!
We have a baby?
The only problem!
Okay, fine.
What was it for?
So you can like, bite, and pull people's hair and stuff?
Well, I think I shouldn't look directly at them.
Come on!
Uh, huh. Or maybe to a galaxy far, far away.
Yeah, I talked to you on the phone, I'm the lady that got stuck with the racecar bed.
Yeah, I know. He can get really competitive.
Joey!
It's only you.
No.
Now, these are-are more realistic, but perishable.
300 dollars?!
Two girls and a boy?
What's the matter?
Maybe.
I mean I have not been picked on this much since kindergarten and they had to bring in someone from junior high to do the see-saw with me.
Stupid.
Thank you.
Rach, that's great! It's so good that you had a good time in Greece!
He used to lock himself in the basement for hours. No one was every allowed to hear, "The Sound."
Y'know what shoes would look great with this ring? Diamond shoes! You're not getting dressed.
Oh no sweetie, no! This is my fault, I wasn't clear! I'm really sorry. And listen, you take as much time as you need to move out okay? There's absolutely no rush.
Yeah, the best you got in high school was Wet Pants Geller.
Hey!
I can do it, okay? Come on, let's go.
God, you are so lucky. I mean, I mean. . . you know what I mean.
No no no, if I couldn't pay you back right away then I'd feel guilty and tense every time I saw you.
I don't think mine likes me either.
Who wasn't invited to the wedding.
God, you are so strong.
Vividly.
Come on, okay, come on this is for all womankind. Let's kill 'um!
That's because I-I was just grabbing some things out of the dryer, and it's static cling. Or maybe it's just that God knew I'd be running into you and saw an opportunity.
I am going... I'm going--Turn it over! I'm... I am going to get these drops in your eyes.
It's hard for some people!
Hi!
Richard's living room, drinking wine.
It is not over because she is going to call you and tell you she loves you. And the reason why she couldn't, is because her feelings were so strong, it scared her. Now you go home and wait for her call, she could be calling you from the plane! Come on now go! Go!
It's like two miles!
Okay.
Okay.
It is so weird, I know what I said, but uh, this morning, I was lying in bed I was, I was imagining what it would be like to say yes. I know it's a little sudden, and it's a little rushed, and it's totally not like me to do something like this, but that doesn't mean I can't. Right? I mean I'm-I'm crazy about Pete, and I know that we want the same things, and when I thought about saying yes, it made me really happy.
Wait! Oh my God! I can't get out!
Do you think he knew I was here?
No it's umm, more like a wrap. Okay so uh, I'm gonna go guys.
I'm outa here.
Now? Is it okay if I go out with Chip Matthews?
No I don't.
No! Umm well, some people say that Oysters are an aphrodisiac.
So then you know?
Ohh! Ohhhh! Were you sleeping sweetie? I'm sorry. Here.
Good, they feel good, in my head.
I hate this game!
Oh, thank you.
You and me both.
Does that smell bother you?
Hmm, no. I mean how can I accept a restaurant from him? I-I-I-I can't. I couldn't even accept a necklace from Stu Vincent in the seventh grade.
Fine!
New York.
You better believe he's tired, after the day we had! If you know what I mean. You know what I mean?
Okay.
This is so much fun!
What time?
Well, you broke up with Julie Grath! How much weight could she have gained?
That was me and Ross.
Hey Rach, the tampons here are only a penny. Let's stock up.
Look, I'm not happy about this either, but y'know if-if Ross says he's happy then we're just gonna have to keep our feelings about Emily to ourselves. Are you cool with that?
Eh, we weren't that close anyway!
Oh, that's too bad.
There's nothing to tell! He's just some guy I work with!
Look, you and I went to different high schools...
Joey let me ask you a question. What does this light switch do?
They can't all be bad. Find the one where you make your bedroom eyes. Ohh, there it is.
Well forget it! It doesn't hurt that baaad!!!!
Twelve dollars an hour.
Could you guys please try to keep it down, we're trying to start a Boggle tournament.
I love you too Chandler.
Wow! All right well, I mean, what can you do? If you lost it you lost it.
Well that's because you always sleep to noon, silly! This is what 9 looks like.
Joey!
Dr. Burke, it, it's me.
Oh wow! Okay. Don't scare me like that okay? I mean for a minute there I was like, "Oh my God! The worst has happened!"
Oh my God!
Continue.
Thank God! I can't watch him anymore!
Is-is-is there a-a Mrs. Stevens?
Ohh.
Uh, so, uh, Rach, uh... do you wanna save this wrapping paper, I mean, it's only a little bit torn... so are you gonna go for it with Ross or should I just throw it out?
What-what are you doing? Is this supposed to be funny?
Eww!!
What?!
I don't think so.
Whoa whoa whoa! Where're you goin'?
Y'know, there's a Starbucks about three blocks down.
It's this dumb thing that Ross made up `cause he was trying to fool our parents. It's a way of giving the finger, without actually having to give it. I remember I cried the night you made it up, `cause it was the first time that I realized that I was actually cooler than my older brother.
Oh, I asked one of the waitresses at work if she'd help me out.
Hugh! Hugh Grant!
Haven't you and I covered that topic?
Yeah! Oh yes!
Whatever you decide, whatever you do.
We're switching rooms again.
Thank you. Come meet my friends. This is uh, Phoebe.
This is my dress!
Oh gosh, listen if you and Chip do it tonight, promise me you'll tell me everything.
Shoot! We're out of soda.
Oh, here's a great one.
Oh, don't you guys look cute. You guys make such a cute couple.
Why?
You know Paul?
Please? Please?! We just don't want to deal with telling everyone, okay? Just promise you won't tell.
Phoebe, you got Joey drums to annoy Rachel, so she wouldn't wanna live there anymore?
Ya know, my party is fun. I mean, maybe it's a little quieter, less obvious sorta fun but, you know, if people would just give it a chance...
Because the winner gets this!
Yeah!
Really?
Why is this car in my bedroom?
We checked. A lot.
This is Rachel.
Whose little ball of paper is this?!
You're kidding?! That's great!
Chandler... In all my life... I never thought I would be so lucky. As to...fall in love with my best...my best... There's a reason why girls don't do this!
Sweetie, with you it's gonna be different. The sex is gonna be great, 'cause you-you guys are in love.
I don't know, maybe. I mean I'm dating a man who's pool I once peed in.
Oh. I guess you can. Okay but; I-I have to return it, so you can't like it.
Big time!
Ready?
There were only twelve.
But you've only slept with two people.
Hey Rach, remember that great song, Me, Myself, and I?
So, are you sorry that I told them?
I'm so sorry.
The strange part was, he was really nice, umm and he looks great, but I didn't feel anything at all!
I think our lover's spat will start a little early this month.
Hey Joey, sweetie, taste this.
On three, 1...2...3! Now my pillow's all wet!
Which one was Pete Carney?
Oh, my fiancee wants the Swing Kings.
Oh my God! He just said my name! Did you hear that?
Oh! So you think I'm a failure!
you don't have insurance?
Yeah right.
Didn't it drive you crazy to have a switch and not know what it did?
Then you'd be going back and forth all the time, I mean it doesn't make any sense.
I'm not gonna go out with him.
Seriously, where did you get the hat?
Ohh! Yeah, I forgot.
Oh, thanks! We'll try to stop by.
Okay...who are you?
No, look, she's obviously unstable, okay? I mean she's thinking about running out on her wedding day. Okay, fine! But I mean, look at the position she's putting him in! What's he gonna do? Ross is gonna run over there on the wedding day and break up the marriage?! I mean, who would do that?! Okay, fine, all right, but that's y'know, it's different! Although it did involve a lot of the same people.
Chandler! It happens to lots of guys! You-you-you were probably tired, you had a lot of champagne, don't worry about it!
Hey, you guys!
I know!
Ross, I can't believe you'd do that!
Y'know what we should do? We should all get dressed up and go to have champagne at The Plaza.
Thank you.
No forget it, I'm not gonna tell you now.
Why?
That's true.
Are you alone?
I'm checking out the restaurant with Pete.
Ross? Let's go.
Well if Ted Kopel talked about his coworkers botched boob jobs, I would.
This is disgusting!
He's seeing someone. I can't believe he's seeing someone.
Phoebe, she sounded pretty upset to me.
What? I-I bought groceries, I was gonna make you dinner!
Chinese menu guy. Forgot the menus.
Ross, but me down for another box of the mint treasures, okay. Where, where are the mint treasures?
Who did we fight in World War I?
I'm so happy for me.
Ross hasn't worked at the museum for a year!
We both do that!
Oops! Y'know, your birthday is in a month-and-a-half, what do you say I forget to get you a present for that too?
Oh, good to see you too. Did you come down here to tell me that?
Joey?! Oh my God, Rachel!
Okay. Umm, Phoebe, you suck too.
Well, what did you do?
Mr. Bigot. He tells the most racist jokes.
You don't have a car. And your license expired.
What the hell is that dog doing here?!
You flicked me first.
We're gonna see each other naked.
Did you smoke?
Oh my God, you're a freak.
Well he is! Yeah, I mean marriage is all he talks about! My goodness, in fact, I'm the one that's making him wait!
Ohh, I'm so glad. Thank you so much for staying so calm during this. I mean it's really, it's made me stay calm. I coulda been worse!
You didn't!
What?! Which one?!
...love you.
What?
Really? Okay, so why don't you tell me what happened to Ross Junior year at Disneyland?
I tried to reach you at work. There's....been a fire.
You didn't even take off your pants.
I can't leave it! You gouged a hole in my dingy floor.
Yeah. All right, I'm gonna go tell Dan that it's not gonna happen. Don't do the dance.
Shh!! Wait, what?
Great. It's gym class all over again.
Oh, I'm so glad you guys like it. Yay! All right I gotta go to work.
In one year?! My God what did she eat? Her-her family! That's not the point.
Hey.
I don't know. Maybe we're some kinda magnets.
I'm sorry, I'll give it back to you.
Yeah, well they suck too.
Wait, we're supposed to organize the wrapping paper drawer.
Shut up, and put my table back.
You would not. I can't believe this. I hate this, you're too normal. I can't believe my boyfriend doesn't have a thing. My boyfriend doesn't have a thing.
Wonderful!
No way, with one pound to go, c'mon. We're workin', we're movin', we're in the zone we're groovin'.
Sure, we have no money, go ahead.
Oh, sweetie. Oh, look at you. You're shivering.
Huh?
What?!
Oh, that's great! Congratulations!
Oh, that's sounds great.
And when I told her that I was gonna be moving in with Chandler, she was really supportive. You were so great. You made it so easy. And now you have to leave. And I have to live with a boy!!
Them?! Who's them?
But I need it. Otherwords I'm gonna have to take that horrible diner job. You know, with the dancing and the costumes. I don't wanna have to wear flame retardant boobs.
That's great!
Danny. Are you guys ever gonna go out again?
That's probably what they'll say.
Okay, Phoebe, y'know what? That-that's it, that's it, all right? No dinosaurs, no ghosts, no giant dogs, okay? They're not the right size, they're not Victorian, and they just don't go.
Well, I've tried everything. I give up. I guess I'm not gonna be the mom who makes the world's best chocolate cookies. I do make the best duck confit with broccoli rabe. Kids love that right.
Yeah and you better watch the flirting too, cause you know, in such close quarters, it could be trouble.
What are you talking about?
No-no, I-I just, I liked them so much that I went out and bought some for myself.
It's goin' great. Right on schedule. Got my little happy helpers.
No, those first two windows, that's the lobby. And y'know the other one over there, that's the stairway. You've been counting wrong.
Well, maybe the mailman liked the cookies, we just didn't give him enough.
Pulling what? It's second down.
I know!!
I thought you said you were going to do nothing.
This is where I thought the barca lounger could go! You see you could see the TV and it's still walking distance to the kitchen.
Ok, which one of us do you think is gonna be the first one to get married?
Is he doing his shark attack bit yet?
No!
Chip, is Chip Matthews.
Oh, absolutely. Yeah, you know I'm not even thinking about that thing that we're not supposed to think about.
I never stop thinking about it.
You still want to move in together right?
Honey, uh, this is a picture of the frame guy posing in front of a bright blue screen with a collie.
What are you doing?!
She's my favorite character on DOOL.
Well it didn't!
Finger cramp. Oh God, sorry. Here, let me get that mom.
Hey, Joey, what would you do if you were omnipotent?
What about when I started dating Chandler?
Hello.
Ross used to stay up every Saturday night to watch Golden Girls!
We're kidding. C'mon, tell us!
Hey guys.
Rachel, it's going to happen. Chandler is gonna move in here.
You made pancakes?
How about a Youhoo with a funny straw?
Hey, come on, Phoebe, you understand don't you?
Very good, so good.
Okay so this is where the band is. And this is where the bar is. And all these pins have people's names on them. And Rach, here you are.
Oh my God! Joey, what did you do after you threw her leg on the fire?
This bottle opener.
You're welcome.
All right, y'know what? We really are late! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!!
That's a good idea! I bet they have one of those wind machines! Y'know...
Oh my God! Fog him! Fog him!
Well you did a little bit.
Well fine! I want to meet this chicken expert! Send the Colonel in!
Did you ever feel like sometimes you are just so unbelievably uncoordinated?
In.
Really?!
How?
You may be okay about getting hurt, but I am not okay with being the one who hurts you. That's why I can't take this job.
Well, what about his family?
So you hit her in the face?
When it's your assistant, I would say never.
Another good point.
If the school finds out you're fired.
Doesn't matter, I'll get 'em tomorrow. Or not. Whenever.
I don't want a beer.
I'll be right back.
No. Big deal, so you have a side of the bed, everybody has a side of the bed.
You have got to get over this. You're not gonna end up alone.
Oh, from who?
It was okay. She's still kind of depressed because she broke up with her boyfriend.
Hey, we can take her back with you if you want.
Hi.
A couple of days.
I cannot believe that I just spent the last two days trying to figure out the recipe and it was in my cupboard the whole time!
Nothing. Nothing.
But, I put some honey in it.
Chandler?
Hi.
Phyllis sees what I'm doing.
Man, I knew it! I knew you were going to do this!!
How desperate am I?
Well, we're trying to find someone to perform our wedding and they're all either boring or annoying or y'know, can't stop staring at the ladies.
Thank you.
I promise you, he would definitely want you back.
Oh, an old glove?
What?!! You cannot tell him that!!
Happy birthday!!!
Monica and I just crashed an embassy party.
Okay! Oh God, y'know what? It's really bad.
Electrical plans for the building.
Okay. I love you so much.
Went down to the docks. Bet ya didn't know you could get it wholesale.
Come here. I'll make you feel like one of the guys. You know for a really cool guy, you suck at foosball.
Well, an-anyway, I just-that night meant a lot to me, I guess I'm just trying to say thanks.
Ugh, y'know, umm we gotta get up early and catch that plane for New York.
I figured out I need to charge seventeen bucks a jar just to break even. So, I've got a new plan now. Babies.
Why do you do it?
Mom and dad just sent me in here to find out if you were trying to get Ross stoned!
This doesn't mean anything, does it?
Okay, I'll go!
What makes you think that I might not be okay?
I'm changing out of this.
You know what? This is not over. We will play you again, and we will win, and you will lose, and you will beg, and we will laugh, and we will take every last dime you have, and you will hate yourselves forever.
Drunk enough to know that I want to do this. Not so drunk that you should feel guilty about taking advantage.
That's right! You lose sucker!! Please still marry me.
NOOOO!!!!!!!!
Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- -I'd want yours.
You gotta help me out here Pheebs.
Nothing, I don't know.
Yeah, I've just been fiddling around in here making delicious treats for everyone.
See yeah umm, you kinda stole my thunder!
Alright.
So, um, how-how did you guys meet?
No?
He didn't ask me to marry him.
What?
You painting his toenails?
Okay, this one I like!
William Sonoma, fall catalog, Page 27.
Will you stop!
If you're not going then I don't want to go either.
No.
See? It's no big deal.
Are you serious?
Just go over and say hi.
Okay, I've got some Ones, you wanna put them in her panties?
I love this friend thing!
Say you're sorry.
All right, hand me that other box of photos; that's the very last one.
No I don't know Chandler! Not anymore! It's like it's like something's changed.
Okay, I got it. Phoebe? All right, you pull. I'm gonna spread the legs as wide as I can. Joey? Now is not the time!
It's Joey's birthday.
Why not?
Hey. Where is he, where's Richard? Did you ditch him?
Hey baby.
Well, y'know it's none of my business, but aren't you married?
I understand.
Nooo!
The ones we had right after you almost threw up.
That guy stood on your neck until you passed out!
Why, do you write him a lot?
He's totally flirting with you too.
In that cute, little, sweet way she just did?
Chandler! What are you doing here?
Thanks. I think you got it!
Honey, it's not pushy, he gave her his home number.
I know. I need more pie.
Whoa! Are you okay?
Oh?
Okay! There's only one left, three letter word, not dog but...
Why don't you just take it with you?
Uh-huh.
I think I need a drink.
Crematorium Chris? Sure!
Oh.
It's that terrible?
That's terrible.
Hi, nice to meet you!
Wow. Joey, how do you do it?
Okay! Very funny! Somebody let me out please?! Come on, I'm cold! And covered in marinara sauce! Come on! Let me out!
Okay, ooh, alright. Name, address... Okay, in case of emergency, call?
You say 'Thank you very much,' and then you buy me something pretty. Come on, we're gonna put are hands in this bowl, and we're gonna start squishing the tomatoes.
Ok, you see, the tag shouldn't be at the top left corner, it should be at the bottom right corner.
Well, not... worried, just... wondering.
Rachel, what're you gonna say to him?
They'r alright.
Hey.
Phoebe, y'know why don't we just go upstairs and have some birthday cake?
Please, when he left town you stayed in your pajamas for a month and I saw you eat a cheeseburger.
I know, how can you not be accross the hall anymore.
I can't tell you. It's a secret.
Of course there's another guy!! This is even more perfect! Now you have to prove your love!
What?!
Okay, d'y'see anybody you think could be me?
Boy, you are really not a morning person.
Hey, don't mix those up, you could really ruin that lollipop.
Oh my God! You're water broke!
Oh God, you fell off the wagon.
Ooh, chocolates on the pillows! I love that!
Ross!
Oh Rachel, I know the best coffee house and it's sooo close.
Yeah. I bet you can't guess what color my tonsils are? I'll bet the apartment!
Oh, let's not tell this story.
Unless...
Did you like it?
Oh God, I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry..
Why would I have the keys?
So how does this work, you going to balance the plates on these little guys' heads?
Well, I don't care! That-that turkey has to feed 20 people at my parent's house and they're not gonna eat it off your head!
Come in. I've been waiting for you.
Relax. Y'know, she may not even know.
Look at you, you won't even look at him.
Hello! Were we at the same table? It's like... cocktails in Appalachia.
You did not go!
Hi.
Uh, look, Larry honey, umm, I wrote the book on Section 5 and I know that you don't have to wear your hat unless you're in the kitchen.
Come on! I really need your help!
Guys, please, I'm just gonna have dinner with him. Okay?
Thank you. This is my friend Phoebe. She's gonna be helping me tonight.
And, and, and they wear those little water wings, you know. And they're, they're running around on the deck. Then Hoyt wraps this big towel around all three of them.
You have nothing! You're not even going out! You're her baby sitter! You have a 12-year-old girl's job!
I'm sorry that I borrowed your gloves
I read to you.
Is anyone thankful for anything else besides a thong?
It's so good, that I feel really selfish about being the only one who's eating it, that I think we should have everyone taste how good it is. Especially Ross.
Hi!
Wendy, we had a deal! Yeah, you promised! Wendy! Wendy! Wendy!
Hey, Rachel, isn't that stuff almost pure...
What?
If you tell me, I'll tell you what Phoebe said.
Come on, no peeking!
What are you talking about?
Please!
Does so count!
Wait a minute, Phoebe! We should be partners. We should be catering partners. I mean, think about it! You're not working right now, and we have such a great time together!
It's gotta be one of a kind. Y'know like umm, y'know uh, what's that God awful ceramic fruit bowl she has on her counter?
Okay, look, this is probably for the best, y'know? Independence. Taking control of your life. The whole, 'hat' thing.
So look umm, while we're st-still in London, I mean, we can keep doing it right?
Hi, I'm Ross's little sister.
I love you.
Hey!
Excuse me, where are you going?
What is it?
Limited seating?! I am just one tiny person!
What are you talking about? What wedding?
What about the part where he has rabies?
Hey!
Alright, I've got a leg, three breasts and a wing.
Well I'm not sure yet, but umm of the top of my head I'm thinking double sided tape and some sort of luncheon meat.
What? Wait! Why? Chandler! Chandler! Wait! I'm sorry, I was just playing for one second! I was trying to find you to tell you that, look if you don't want me to see Richard again, I won't! He means nothing to me!
Oh, I'm sorry. Can I get you something?
Keep talking.
Good! Now, take those salads to table 4, And you! Get the swordfish! And you! Get a haircut!
What is that?
Alright, for the bizillionth time, yes I see other women in shower at the gym, and no I don't look.
Did you just smell my hair?
What?
W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-...
Nope. Schhorry.
Did you know I was allergic to shellfish?
How does she do that?
Y'know, I-I-I don't think that I can. So if you don't mind, maybe this will be it for me on the work things.
Okay.
Ohh, this is soo amazing! I can't believe my brother's getting married! And in London! It's so romantic!
Congratulations! Wow! I can't believe you're nominated for an Emmy!
Really?
From here to the airport?
Well, I'm never gonna listen to you again, that's for sure! "Y'know, harm can it do if you go and put your name down?"
Yes, but you cannot tell anyone! No one knows!
Yes, a relationship. For your information I am crazy about this man.
Umm.
Really?
Yes!!
I was.
Why did you hire me?
In like a half-hour?
You've got to get back out there, it's your party.
Thank you. Rachel, can I talk to you outside for a sec?
Ya know, Roy saw Star Wars 317 times. His name was in the paper.
Are you crazy?!
Okay, just get a lot better. Fast.
Wow. That is not a happy hi.
Jacket now.
Okay that does sound like fun.
Hi!
It was.
Yeah, well you promised Barry, you'd marry him.
About a half an hour.
Oh my God!
Run, Marcel, run! Run, Marcel! Are you okay?
Take care.
Really?! You promise?
Oh no-no-no, not Dr. Burke. Dr. Burke is out of town. The-the on-call doctor will see me now.
Really!
What did you do to his sweater vests?
What's that supposed to mean?
Chandler, I'm unemployed and in dire need of a project. Ya wanna work out? I can remake you.
No, Ross, we do not hate Emily. We-we just, we just think that you're having to sacrifice a whole lot to make her happy.
Oh stop it. Joey already told me.
As a thank you, Rachel and I will kiss for one minute.
Please, just a little bit off the back.
The best man? Wow!
Nooo!
Is that all?
Yeah, let-let-let's pretend that's not true.
What did you say?
"Hi I'm Rachel, is my sweater too tight? No? Oh, I'd better wash it and shrink it!"
Ross, when's this comet thing start?
Yeah! But, he can't not exactly see Emily, I mean that's his wife.
Oh...
Okay. Can you give me a little push?
I don't believe you spent my wedding fund on the beach house!
So your first whole weekend without Ben, what're you guys gonna do?
Uh-huh.
All right, look, Ross. I realize that you have issues with Carol and Susan, and I feel for you, I do. But if you don't help me cook, I'm gonna take a bunch of those little hot dogs, and I'm gonna create a new appetizer called "pigs in Ross". All right, ball the melon.
Your favorite!
Phoebe, you're gonna be with your grandma?
People! People say it! Come here!
Do you mind telling us what it is?
How's it going?
Yeah, I think I have some around here somewhere. Why?
Hello? Yeah, hi! Mrs. Tribbiani? Hi, this is Monica Geller. Yeah I'm just calling to say that Chandler and I uh, really hope you can make it to the wedding. Yeah, apparently a bunch of invitations that we sent weren't delivered. Umm, I guess there was some screw up at the damn post office! T-Tell me about it! Yeah, yeah, the US Post Office? No, more like US lost office! What are they Irish?!
Well, he's my parents' best friend, he has to be there.
Put all my money in me.
Oh my God!
No, you're the best.
Yeah. I guess.
I wish all guys could be like him.
Sure! It doesn't mean anything! Just like I know it doesn't mean anything with you!
What? You freak! You wouldn't even have known about this place if it wasn't for me!
Bye! Ten bucks says, I never see that woman again in my life.
I know. But umm, one time there was this really dirty car in front of the building, so I washed it.
Well, no, not at all, you're not terminal, you just, you just need some damage control.
Fat?!
Oh my God.
You're so efficient. I love you!
Shut up! This place is a hole!
I know.
Y'know, I only know of two surefire ways to shut a man up. And one of them is sex.
Oh Ross, sometimes grown-ups have commitments they just can't get out of!
Are you sure you wanna do this?
Ross, how long have you been planning this wedding?
It's not your birthday.
Oh my God!
Hey, guys, what-what should I wear to a Knicks game?
That's right. That's right. And that is why you can't stay here tonight. And probably why you shouldn't come to the wedding.
Let go!
Are you kidding me?! Is this; is this turning you on?
Oh, now you want a pad.
Would you let it go? It's not that big a deal.
What, Phoebe, did you whip the potatoes? Ross needs lumps!
I gotta go to work. Has anybody seen my left boob?
OK, what're we gonna do about this?
No-no! Don't do it! Don't!
I know, but you have to open it today!
No time for that!
Oh. Well did you get it? Let me see.
Ross, there he is.
Wow! It's like Rachel in High School.
Oh, you came to tell him you love him! I knew it! I was right! I'm right, right?
I know! I know.
Same category?
Okay.
Bye!
Chandler! Okay, let me get this straight, it's okay for you to flirt, but not for me.
No! I'm not okay!
What are you talking about? She just invited him to the biggest party of the millennium!
Chandler that's crazy! If you give up every time you'd have a fight with someone you'd never be with anyone longer than-Ohhh!
Are you insane? I mean Joey, is going to kill you, he's actually going to kill you dead.
I know.
That's not funny.
If you would stop thinking about Ross for one minute you would notice that there are great guys everywhere! I mean, look! Look, Gunther! I mean, he's nice, he's cute.
What's with him?
What was the dream about?
Oh yeah, well there's the possibility that I won't make rent.
What?
Oh-oh, no no don't worry, I'm gonna wash it.
Why?
We were, we were just in the storage area and we saw this really creepy man!
Okay. Man, I have not made this many cookies since I was in the ninth grade.
Y'know, let's face it, I'm not a kid anymore! I-I need to be with someone who-who wants the same things that I do! I mean coming to my place of work and telling me that you love me, I want that! Talking about pig sex over lunch, I don't want that!
De-caff. Okay, everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor. This is everybody, this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my brother Ross?
Well, so far I have uh, my bride's maids dresses won't get picked up, my veil gets lost, or I don't have my something blue.
I think he's shy.
Well umm, we were just talking about the y'know, the Swing Kings and just wondering whether y'know, they were the right way to go.
Unless...
Hey.
Yeah, I think we're ready for our first course. OK, um, these are rot-shrimp ravioli, and celantro pondou sauce... ... with just a touch of mints... and... ... ginger.
Phoebe, do you think that your favorite animal says much about you?
Hi, Dad. No, no, it's me. li-listen, Dad, I can't talk right now, um, but there's something, um... there's something that I've been meaning to tell you...
My Sweet Sixteen! Remember, you went to third base with my cousin Charlie.
He's not gonna say anything, because we're not gonna tell him.
Hate that guy!
I'll help you fix your sweater.
Ross you know that tonight is your date with Hillary?
Is it the Italian guy?
Why did I 'woo-hoo'? I mean, what was I hoping would happen? That-that he'd turn round and say 'I love that sound, I must have you now'?
Well, uh, I ate some.
And lucky means, more cleavage?
Here, I got it. I'll will play my message for you guys, and you can tell me if it's breezy enough.
Wait, wait, he came up with that himself. Tell them, Chandler.
Yeah, ah, but Pheebs don't you think he's a little young to get married?
Chandler, umm, I want you to take just a minute and I want you to think about how ridiculous this sounds.
Chandler, we said we would meet at the coffeehouse at six.
You wanna get out of my face?
They have racquets don't they?!
Excellent!
You can, I know you can!
Hey Rach, what about this? Huh? Who-who gets this? See, I don't know if I want it because it might be y'know, too many memories!
Phoebe, stop writing about us!
Because then I don't have to!
Yeah, she hates all mass produced stuff. She thinks her furniture should have a history, a story behind it.
Look, when it started I was just trying to be nice to her because she was my brother's girlfriend. And then, one thing led to another and, before I knew it, we were...shopping.
What?
Viva Las Gaygas!
So, Mr. Rastatter, what exactly does this job entail? The ad wasn't too clear.
OK, look. That is Aunt Iris. This woman has been playing poker since she was five. You gotta listen to every word she says. Hi!
Hey!
Hey! There you are!
Ok, um so, I still have to invite Dillon and Emma and Shannon Cooper.
I'm sorry, I think that you just misunderstood her.
Hey-hey-hey. You wanna hear something that sucks.
Hello Dan! I'm really looking forward to Saturday night! Really, really!
Maybe.
What are you talking about?
Ross, your little creatures got the remote again.
Ugh, she's upstairs not doing the dishes! And I tell ya something! I'm not doing them this time! I don't care if those dishes sit in the sink until they're all covered with-I'll do them when I get home!
All right!
This baby has got everything. Take y'know, locations for instance. First, organized alphabetically, then geographically, then by square footage.
Oh it's umm, good! It's umm, it's good, just here watering the plants.
See ya.... Waitwait, what's with you?
So, Chandler, who's on your list?
Why don't you just weigh out the good stuff about the relationship against the bad stuff. I mean that's what I did when I first weighing stuff.
That's my pie!
Cups.
It was Michelle. It was definitely Michelle.
Oh-oh, my God!
That's Mindy? Wow, she is pretty. Lucky. To have had a friend like you.
What baby?
Wow! I'm-I'm-I'm glad you smashed her watch!
Oh! Do you need me to go with you?
Are you sure you wanna do this?
No-no-no, that's a video-phone. But hey guys you're not supposed to be here, so please, do not touch anything.
Yes, I'm sure! Rachel is there something that you want to talk me about?
So um, who was she?
All right, eight we get married, but 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12 we don't get married.
Cute PJ's! You're really livin' it up here in London huh?
Then what is it?
Like I remember his office number! Speed dial 7.
I'd do anything for you.
You're gonna find a place. But even if - God forbid - you didn't.. So you postpone the wedding. Is that really so bad? I mean, think about it. You could take all the time you needed to get everything that you want. You could have tulips, you could have salmon.... Mmmmm... Salmon!!
I can't be fair. You're my boyfriend.
Joey, I left my watch on the counter last night. It was right here, where is it?
Well, thanks anyway.
Oh yeah, I totally agree.
Guys, hurry up! The flight leaves in four hours! It could take time to get a taxi! There could be traffic! The plane could leave early! When we get to London, there could be a line at customs! Come on!!
Oh, that's what I would do, forget mine.
Phoebe, what's the matter?
Joey, what are you doing? You promised Phoebe you wouldn't eat meat until she has the babies!
Wow! You might just get the first Nobel prize in rubbing. So what country is this guy from?
You sat back and let him have her, you didn't fight at all. Am I right? Do you want the same thing to happen with Emily?
Why are you talking about volcanoes all of the sudden?
Not as each other!
I'm getting married!!!! I'm gonna be a bride!!!! No, I will not shut up because I'm engaged! Ohh, big talk! Huh, why don't you come over here and say that to me?! Huh, buddy?! Yeah, my fiancee will kick your ass! Come on, apartment 20! Apartment 20!
This is me in The Sound of Music. See the von Trapp kids?
Chandler.
Oh.
Well, you're not working either.
Hell no, we'll pay!
Here!
How did work go?
What is it?!
Well, this is the last box of your clothes. I'm just gonna label it, "What were you thinking?"
I mean, I realize that his feelings may never completely go away, but you can.
Regular or decaf?
Okay, so I'm responsible, I'm organised. But hey, I can be a kook.
He's not boring! He's just-he's just low key.
I can't believe you're gonna have sex on my engagement night!!
Noo!! It's driving me crazy. I mean every other way he's like the perfect guy, he has everything. Plus! He actually has everything.
Oh my God!
All right, check me out.
Sure, every time, you're such a princess...
I'm dicing, I'm dicing, I don't hear anything.
Or incredibly offensive.
Yes!!
Who is that?!
Dr. Greene. Oh my God it's Rachel's dad. What're you doing here?
How did it go?
Don't say it.
You don't know everything. Did you know that I'm going out with Rachel tonight instead of you? Hmm? And did you know that the only baby around here is you?! And did you know that I can't even look at you right now?!
Oh, right, right. How was your date, 'Chand-lrr'?
What?
No, it is me! Y'know, I'm not just the person who needs to fluff the pillows and pay the bills as soon as they come in! Y'know, when I'm with her, I am so much more than that. I'm- I'm Monana!
What-what's the matter? Is there, is there something on my dress?
Of course not. I mean gosh, Chandler what you did, it's, it's a wonderful thing and I really appreciate it. I know I have this weird thing where I want everything to be in the perfect place, but I'd never expect you to worry about that.
Oh my God yes! Who is she?
You know what, maybe I don't need to have children. You know maybe I just think I do because that is what society, and by that I mean my mom, has always convinced me that I... I do, I have to have children, I'm sorry, I just do.
Yo- hooo!
Hey umm, what's this?
Joey, you know, maybe your just not used to kissing men, maybe you just tensed up a little, maybe that's what you need to work on.
Carol called me to thank me for the lasagna, I asked, she told me.
How can that be?! Oh wait! Wait! Are you, are you serious?!
Anyway, we're really excited about our wedding plans, and well I guess pretty soon we'll be making a big withdrawal from the Monica wedding fund. What?
Oh, please.
But I'm gonna be there... for the rest of my life. I mean, I can't break up with him. I'm the one who made him quit drinking. He's dull because of me.
Okay.
Uh-hmm.
I just thought he was nice, y'know?
You're the most wonderful man. And if you hadn't of said 'if I have to' like seventeen times, then I'd be saying 'okay, let's do it.'
Oh my God, it was the best funeral ever! I mean, everyone loved the food, and guess what? I even got another funeral for tomorrow-the dead-guy-from-today's best friend. I mean, it is like I am the official caterer for that accident!
No, no, wait. His flight doesn't leave for another forty-five more minutes.
She said that?!
No that's, that's okay.
Back then, I thought that I would never, ever get the chance to go out with a Chip Matthews, and now he's-he's called me up and asked me out. And the fat girl inside of me really wants to go. I-I owe her this. I never let her eat.
Well at least, I'm going to mute it.
Hello.
Joey, we had a deal. That-that's why you're here! I've got to fire you!
Okay, here's batch 22. Ohh, maybe these'll taste a little like your grandmother's. This has a little bit of orange peel, but no nutmeg.
No.
How? I don't have any money.
Oh God! He's gonna come by and borrow some candles for his big date!
Rachel's at work.
Rach? Can I talk to for just a minute? I-I dropped some socks.
Hi, Dad, what are you doing here?
It's Richard Burke.
You guys, Joey just saw Janice kissing her ex-husband.
Okay, let's start with the free messages outside the UN.
Oh God bless my dad sound proofing the basement!
What's hard to believe?
Or not.
So, we did okay at the strip club, right?
No, a guy would be saying, "I'm never gonna get to sleep with anyone else." Oh my God! I'm never gonna get to sleep with anyone else! I've been so busy planning the wedding that I forgot about all the things that I'd be giving up! I mean, I...I'm never gonna have a first kiss again.
Maybe, do you need a tissue?
Would it really have been that easy?
I am so jealous.
Oh honey, is that 'cause your Mom died around Christmas?
She looks exactly like Aunt Marilyn.
Umm, so how long have you been working with your dad? Come on, one of us had to mention him.
Hello? Hold on please. Joey, it's your mom.
No-wait-no-no!!!!!!!
Do you wanna come in for some lemonade?
What?! I didn't take care of everything, there's-there's plenty of things for you to do!
Umm, why don't you give me something that would be a good reason and-and then I'll tell you if it's true.
What?! I mean, I didn't work this hard and-and-and lose all this weight so that I can give my flower to someone like him!
Oh, you really want to talk about getting people to like you huh, funny man?
Oh, are the drapes still closed hon?
Okay, the reason why I asked you guys out to brunch today is because I have been doing some thinking about who should be my maid of honor.
Honey, umm I-I love you, but umm, if you call our wedding a party one more time, you may not get invited. Okay? Listen, we could always earn more money, okay? But uh, we're only gonna get married once.
Hey guys!
Wait a minute, they're making you take time off work?
Come on, she'll be here any minute.
Awww, just like you always wanted. Congratulations
When two people finally realise their feelings for each other, and-and they talk for hours, and they-they learn all about the other person!
It's my TV.
I think you look fine.
Oh, I haven't had that feeling since I first started going out with Chandler. Wow, I'm never gonna have that feeling again am I?
All right, Phoebe get open. Rachel, go long.
Wait a minute, are you doing Joey's "Audition didn't go so well. Yeah it did?"
Okay? Over here we have pink suede, which is nice. But umm, if it gets wet then you know it's gonna shrink.
Alright.
You're gonna like him so much. So umm, when do you want to meet him?
Would you stop? We've only been going out a couple of weeks, I mean we don't even know if he's gonna propose.
Oh my God, I went to high school with her. Rachel! Hi!
What is it with you people! I mean, the minute you start to feel something, you have to run away?
So on this road trip, did you guys win any money?
I will.
Look umm, of all people, you do not want me to tell this story!
Well, if you're gonna be totally rational about this, I can't argue with you! All right? Fine, if you wanna tell him, tell him. I just don't want to be a part of it.
Um, well, I was going to, I-I-I really was. But um, then somewhere, just out of nowhere, I didn't.
The wedding starts at six.
Listen, uh, you told me something that was really difficult for you. And I, I-I figured if you could be honest, then I can to.
Are you alright?
Oh, Larry.
Hi.
Nice to meet you! My God you're great!
How was your first day?
Maurice.
Uh, ah. Unless you wanna stay over? I mean, I'm going to, so...
I'm just easing you in.
Not never. I mean, I'm gonna see him tomorrow at my eye appointment.
Y'know in a weird way, you have too much power. Look, you're gonna have to help me out here, 'cause I only have three.
Hey! It's me. Mon-i-ca! Can I just tell you how proud I am of you.
Cache? Jaunty?
Oh that's an eye removal machine.
What took you so long?
Why do you guys have so many keys in there anyway?
And what are you laughing at, Miss `My-keg-sucking-boyfriend-is-stealing-from-me!'
Chandler! I have to tell you, you smell so smokey I have to get up. I'm not kidding.
Uh, yeah.
What about me?
Look at us all dressed up for the big office party! By the way, what are we celebrating?
Hey!
GET OUT YOU DUFUS!!
That is not true!
That was some hot love you gave me! I'm gonna go get ready.
He is so cute. So, where did you guys grow up?
What?!
Well...honestly ever since we got engaged I have been waiting for something to, to flip you out.
Pheebs, how's it going?
I can't believe that this whole time we thought he hated us. I mean, isn't it amazing how much you can touch someone's life, without even knowing it?...Would you look at this dump? He hated us. This is his final revenge!
You're not on TV.
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
What are you doing?
I'm a twinkie.
Deal!
Phoebe, what are you doing?
How much did ever really win before?
Yeah! She's right in there!
Look at you. All jealous.
I bet this will work!
Of course.
Then all your stuff would be here.
I'll bet he's totally over me, I'll bet he's fine.
It doesn't say that!
You're not dressed yet?! We're supposed to start having fun in 15 minutes!
I just thought that if I could follow the wire I could find out what it did.
Oh, you must be freezing. You know what you need? How about a nice steaming cup of hot Mockolate?
I wanna wake up early and go get it for you!
Hey, I've come to terms with it, you have to too.
Quit flicking
Joey, you had the night!
Okay! Why?!
Hey Joey, Chandler sold a story to Archie Comics!
Phoebe, your face is fine! Come on, none of this stuff is going to happen to you! Stop being such a baby!
This is so unfair! She's got everything I want, and she doesn't have my mother.
What do you mean?
Hold on a second! What is that on her ankle?
What?!
Chandler, look I-I know that your dad embarrassed you. I know...
Phoebe, your liver is right here.
White House adviser? Clinton's campaign guy? The one with the great hair, sexy smile, really cute butt?
Get in there man! Flirt back, mix it up!
Hey-hey.
So what, you're not the only one. I mean, half the time we don't know where we're going. You've just gotta figure at some point it's all gonna come together, and it's just gonna be... un-floopy.
Well?
Why won't I be married when I'm 40?
Yeah. You're just gonna have to stop pissing me off.
I was kidding.
Wait a minute. I thought last night was great.
..I dunno, a little too Alan?
Well, if we owe it? Oh my... When is Joey gonna be home?
Yeah.
Whoa!!! Are you kidding me?!
No.
Oh. Why didn't you take her?
Hey!
Oh god, waddawe do, waddawe do, waddawe do?
I'm Monica.
All right, sorry.
No you robot!!
Rachel, the cute doctors are here.
Well, when you first met Barry, you flitted off to Vail.
Y'know, I never saw that.
Hey, don't blame me for wigging tonight!
This isn't even my dress.
What?
Really?
Okay, umm, okay, umm... It's just Joey and Ross.
Right. Umm, listen since we're-we-re on that subject, umm, I just wanted to tell you that uh, well, I-I was going through a really hard time in London, what with my brother getting married and that guy thinking I was Ross's mother...
Clogs.
Why?! To celebrate your relationship! To solidify your commitment! To declare your love for one another to the world!
Why would someone do that?! ...One might wonder.
You didn't.
What?
Yeah, but Janice? That-that was like the worst breakup in history!
You are just the sweetest.
So you had fun, huh?
Oh wait, Joey, you can't go like that! You stink!
Like?
Oh good, another dinosaur story. When are those gonna become extinct?
Oh, that's great! I mean I'm-I'm sorry, but I'm so happy for you. And now I can work for you!
Okay.
Think about it.
Rach, here's your mail.
I'm his sister, okay? I love him! I don't want to see him get hurt! Come on! Doesn't that give me the right to control him-help him?
What? So you guys don't mind going out with someone else who's going out with someone else?
Oh, I like Elizabeth.
Oh that's okay. Don't worry about it, you can give it to me when we get back.
No, nononono.. it's just.. things change. People change.
Hey!
I'm kidding! I'm kidding!
You are not a freak. You're a guy.
All right then, your bra would still be big.
Because she's not gonna get to keep the babies.
Hey, it's Funny's cousin, Not Funny.
Hey, the man's dog just died.
What?
And his puppet too.
If you want, I'll do it.
Okay! Okay! Okay! We'll see you in about 3 to 4 hours.
Last night.
Yes! All right, y'know what? Why don't we start with a practice run? Okay?
You dated her!
Ok, that's enough.
Yeah! That's why I'm sleeping with him on the side.
Hm-hmm!
No.
What?!!
Rachel! You okay?
Pete.
Oh good, Lenny and Squigy are here.
Shut up, I'm happy.
Hello? It's Joey. I'm so glad you called! Chandler told me what happened. Y'know he's really upset about it.
Hey, have you guys eaten, because uh, Richard and I just finished and we've got leftovers... Chicken and potatoes... What am I wearing?...Actually, nothing but rubber gloves.
Well, it's getting late.
Joey, what are you doing?! It's never gonna happen, she's seeing somebody.
There you go!
Yes but my mom got me this job.
Hey. Ross, did you know Mom and Dad are going to Puerto Rico for Thanksgiving?
W-wait. What is that?
Well, not anymore.
Okay, now Thanksgiving's over, let's get ready for Christmas. Who wants to go get a Christmas tree?!
Yes.
Yeah hey, a weird thing happened today whey I was at brunch. This woman overheard that I was marrying you and-and then she...she wished me good luck.
That can't be your father.
Oh! Let's see, well...if this is the wedding hall then umm you're parents will be at home in Queens.
That's what you've been working on for the past two hours?!
So it's okay to date a student.
I need a few more things to make the margaritas. Uhh, I need some salt, some margarita mix, and tequila.
Are you scared?
Good. What made you change your mind?
My God! Chandler, we said be 'aloof' not 'a doof'.
Hi, Josh.
I can't believe her, y'know it's just-it's so typical.
Yeah, I do know.
Chandler is such an idiot!
Honey. Uh, not to sound too Florence Henderson but, dinner's on the table.
Woo-hoo, stuud!
I can't believe he did this.
Christmas cookie?
'Cause I just keeping thinking about all these things that I'm not gonna have and it's freaking me out. I don't know what to do about it.
I know!
All right ah, Ross, this is the extent of my knowledge on the subject. Call Rachel.
All right boys, last chance for the tickets!
Oh hey Joey! We've been watching all day, when are you gonna be on TV?
Is Joey here?
Oh really, so that hysterical phone call I got from a woman at sobbing 3:00 A.M., "I'll never have grandchildren, I'll never have grandchildren." was what? A wrong number?
Because! She's my cousin. I mean, we grew up together! We're family y'know? Well that's important to me.
Oh, but wait I do have a globe.
All weekend? That's a whole lotta naked.
Joey, this is sick, it's disgusting, it's, it'snot really true, is it?
Did you like her? And I'm just asking as a friend, because I am totally fine with this.
Phoebe! Rachel! It's Monica! I wonder what you could possibly need me for on such short notice! Oh.
That's not gonna work.
What is it hon?
All right, you ready?
Oh my God!
Like a pirate?!
No! But, I'm throwing this shirt away! I think there was a little misunderstanding before.
That's Phoebe! Where did you get that?
Okay, but wouldn't it be easier if you had to tell me something that you could tell me.
Yeah, there you go!
Yeah. Which one do you like more?
Oh. Big family dinner tonight?
Oh, I love my life, I love my life!
Who is it?
It's okay. I suppose it could happen to anyone, not anyone I know, but... By the way I can still see it.
So how was Joan?
Maybe. Joey: Wait. Your 'not a real date' tonight is with Paul the Wine Guy?
Hi.
No I didn't, I said kiwi lime. That's what makes it so special.
'Fraid so. Brown hair, green eyes...
Well, an-anyway, I just-that night meant a lot to me, I guess I'm just trying to say thanks.
Am I doing here? Why? Surprised to see me? Ross brought me. How do you like that?!
All right, there's some pizza at my place, we can all eat with one hand right? Are you with me?
What?!
Hard 8?! We should call it easy 8!
Uh, listen, I need that broiling pan that Joey borrowed the other day.
Yeah, y'know I-I made a commitment to you. Y'know what, it'd be, it'd be fun.
You stole them from me!
Chandler, this actually bothers you?
Alright.
Not necessarily...
God, Ross is on a date with your sister! How weird is that?!
Well, she actually has a boyfriend y'know herself, named Clark. Uh, she also kinda invited herself to our wedding. Clark too.
I sure do! And you don't get one!
Ow. Ow. Ow.
No he's not!
Can you believe he just offered me a restaurant?
Here's your tea Phoebe.
Rachel, you say you're sorry or your sweater gets it.
Whatever.
Yeah!
All right, were you guys smoking something in the back of our van?
Please!!
So! He'll understand!
Rachel!
It's not gonna happen. They're doing it tonight, we can do it tomorrow.
What's wrong Phoebe?
That was you?!
And! We also have speaker phone.
What can we do for you?
Well, I mean what about friends of your grandmother's? Wouldn't they have the recipe?
Ohh, here you are. Y'know, I'm-I'm glad you decided to hear me out.
Nothing.
That's right. My Mom doesn't have any faith in me! Oh, that's hilarious! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.
What we did was wrong. Oh god, I just had sex with somebody that wasn't alive during the Bicentennial.
Oh Soap Opera Digest award!
Because Chandler still has feelings for you!
Really?! How much?!
Deal!
Man, this sucks! Y'know if Mom and Dad don't see us on TV after we made them so jealous, I mean, who's gonna be the losers then?
Hello? Oh, hi Wendy! Yeah, eight o'clock. What did we say? Ten dollars an hour?... OK, great. All right, I'll see you then. Bye.
It-it's so great to see you both here.
OK, try this salmon mousse.
Why?
Okay. Umm, y'know, I don't think, I don't think I told you this, but umm, I just got out of a really serious relationship.
Alright.
Yeah. I think you have to draw him out. And then- when you do- he's a preppy animal.
Can we just start throwing things in?
And, well, don't you have a lot of wild oats to sew? Or is that what you're doing with me? Oh my God, am I an oat?
There are no jobs. There are no jobs for me.
Yeah, come on, we can be guys!
Paul!
OK.
Really?!
Okay, looks like Ross and I are captains. Okay, so um, I bunnied first so that means I get to pick first. Joey.
Four, please. I'm really nervous. Thank you.
I love you!
And what if I was still fat? Well, you wouldn't be dating me, that's for sure.
I can't find garbage bags!
Hi! If you're calling before Saturday, you've reached Monica and Chandler. But if you're calling after Saturday, you've reached Mr. and Mrs. Bing! Please leave a message for the Bings!
Hoyt?
I'll get it! Happy Thanksgiving!
Hello, Chandler.
Man, I would be great in a war! I mean, I really, I think I would make a fantastic military leader. I mean I know I would make General way before any of you guys.
No, only because that's the graduation song.
I'm sorry I almost made you sleep with Ross.
Thanks!
You are so sweet to notice! Yes, I lost three and a half pounds!
Oh, Rachel, sweetie, look, here's a really cute picture of Joey and you at the reception.
Y'know what, I've got to walk out of here right now, 'cause getting over you is the hardest thing that I have ever had to do. I don't think I could do it again.
Oh my God, sit down! Sit down! How long as it been since we've seen each other?
You really think this is okay?
It was a mistake. Please don't take this to mean anything, because it doesn't.
It was a really beautiful service.
Oh, why is it unfair?
Especially the after taste, you know, I'll tell ya, that'll last ya till Christmas.
Could you please tell me what this is in reference to? Yes, hold on. Um, they say there's been some unusual activity on your account.
We'll try to be more careful okay? It's just that, we don't want everyone to know because this is going really well, and maybe the reason it's going really well is because it's a secret.
Rachel, what are you doing? Its freezing out here. Would you come back inside?
Does she use the cups? Yes! I believe she does. Does she use the plates? Yes! I believe she does.
Then you two can, can sneak into the cockpit, and things will start to heat up, and then a stewardess comes in... I've been watching too much porn.
I think his begging days are over now that he's going out with Nancy Branson.
All right.
So, do you want me to watch Ben for you?
Well, why would she lie to you?
Sit down. All right? Please, just listen to me. You are terrible at this! Okay? You are the worst ultimate fighter ever! Ever!!
Hi.
All right, well why don't I go out with an ex-boyfriend and do Joey a favor?!
Game!
You're Lewis Posin.
Okay!
All right then, go fight for her! Go to London! I mean, that could be you and Emily! That, but-but nicer. Just, go to London!
Ya know, I was thinking. Ya know how we always stay at your apartment? Well, I thought maybe tonight we'd stay at my place.
So, what do you think we should do?
Joey that is so sweet.
Phoebe! Phoebe, open up!
Look!
Yeah.
I think I'll help her out. What is going on here?
I mean don't you trust her?
Well that's it. People never say `We need to talk' unless it's something bad.
Windows are clean, candels are lit. Uh, belt's to tight, gotta change the belt. Did I turn the fish? No, cause I made lasagne. Am I out of control?
Oh, Rach! Rach! Umm hey, could you do me a favor and would talk to Chandler's dad and try to keep him away from Chandler's mom?
If you really want to watch that Serengetti thing, you can.
I'm really not deciding!
Then get over yourself! Grow up!
I have like five times, but the guy is so charming, that I go up there to yell and then I end up apologizing to him.
Isn't this great?
I give good massages! I used to give them to Rachel all the time before she got allergic! And-and-and Chandler loves them! Watch!
Hey!
My God! Is this a gym card?
Okay, so Ross will be doing the reading.
Why?
Chandler, I said I was sorry.
No honey, I'm sorry, but the weekend's not over yet.
Chandler, please, come on. Look at him.
Are you funny? Tell us a joke!
Just like you told her you did! ... Just pointing out the irony.
But my clothes are-ohh!
I have no idea.
Wait a minute, she isn't... She's not the one who you...
Yeah.
What's up?
Just uh, do the right thing.
Oh.
Y'know what, champ? I think I'll pass.
