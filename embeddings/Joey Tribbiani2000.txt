Yeah, yeah sure, goodnight.
You don't say.
Yeah, take a hike wetpants!
Can I come?! I won't even talk! You'll just hear the noise from my video camera.
OH YES!!!!!
Yeah, like you could find something as sophisticated as this.
No way! It's mine!!
Joey. Hey Jake, do you like the Knicks?
So uh, hey, that uh, that wedding ring, huh? Man, that's nice!
Yeah-Hey, don't worry, she's a terrific girl. And hey listen, could you do me a favor? When she comes out could you just mention that I'm not looking for a serious relationship; that'd be great.
Chandler, you have to start getting over her. All right, if you play, you get some fresh air, maybe it'll take your mind off Janice, and if you don't play, everyone will be mad at you 'cause the teams won't be even. Come on.
Yeah, Ross, way to ruin it. I was just going to get dressed.
Uhh, the ball thing.
Thank you. Wait wait wait wait, you see me again. Hang on, the guy's butt's blockin' me. There I am, there I am, there I am, there I am, there I am. . .
Hey!
No! No! No, not after seeing that.
Hey-hey-hey! So, how did it go with Dana? Any reason I should leave a block of time open say Thursday?
Woah, woah, woah, woah. Which sister?
I am telling you Ross, she is definitely gonna fall in love with you again! Now, is that what you want?
Cookie, now you can punch him!
I'm just so nervous! Y'know? The callback isn't until tomorrow at five. I feel like my head is going to explode!
Alright open your eyes.
Uh, aren't we kind of in the middle of something here?
Luck!
I'm afraid the situation is much worse than we expected. Your sister is suffering from a..subcranial hematoma. Perhaps we can discuss this over coffee.
Yeah! And-and things aren't as...smashed down as I thought they were gonna be.
: That book got me through some tough times.
Yeah?
With a man?
That's what that was?! 'Cause that other thing? I thought you were on to something, but it did nothing for me.
Hey, Chan, can you help me out here? I promise I'll pay you back.
Poor thing. Cut down in her prime.
Uhhh, Phoebe and Joey.
I was tired!
Hey, what's up?
Hey!
You got a little bored?
Whoa-whoa-whoa! Before you start handing out wedding rings and planning bachelor parties, don't you have to decide who your best man is gonna be?
Come on man! You never want to do anything since you and Janice broke up.
That guy's still doing that?!
Sure! Where are the seats?
You got it.
Well, if she's my friend, hopefully she'll understand. I mean, wouldn't you guys?
... It's a fertility study.
Take it back?
Pheebs! There you are! Okay, you broke my fridge; you owe me 400 bucks!
Hey, that coupon expires, you know.
No! If anyone's a sex addict here, it's Monica! Yeah. Yeah. She has been trying to get me back in the sack ever since London!
Joey!
Oh, wait-wait! Maybe it's a pickle?!
Oh, they cut me out of the show.
All right, I'm gonna go!
Like you wouldn't believe. Wow! This is a great place.
I don't know.
Well, he's not used to women being so forward with him; but uh, I good check with him-He says it's okay. Great! Thanks! Bye-bye!
You kissed my girlfriend!
She's right y'know.
Now she sounded breezy.
No. Why?
Was the chord at least right...
I don't know, I was kinda hopin' no one would ever find out.
All right, I'll see you in the morning.
Look at this clown! Just because he's got a bigger boat he thinks he can take up the whole river. Get out of the way jackass! Who names his boat Coast Guard anyway?
Listen uh, could you put Kathy on, I wanna apologize.
Ohhh, here it comes.
Kinda looks like that stuff you get when you get a bad infection.
Or maybe it's because this guy's doing so good they wanna put more people on it. You should see this guy, Chandler, he goes through two bottles a day.
Man that was great! Huh? Can you believe how long we threw that ball around?
What?!
Just now, after acting class. At first I thought she was doing some kind of scene, that's why I let people watch.
Is to have a long, long talk. Y'know? Get Joey out on the open road and really open him up.
Huh?
So I can do it?
Oh no-no-no! No-no-no-no-no-no-no!
Becasue at first he thought it was Joseph. But after he asked Joseph about it, turns out it was you. Anyway, I just thought you should know.
Funny one! That's good!
Hey! Y'know how we ah, save all those chopsticks for no reason we get when we get Chinese food?
Okay, take it easy.
Right. Thanks. It's June. I'm outta here.
: Ahhh, that's alright. Y'know, that's a tough hand to beat.
No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no... It's okay, I mean I-look Rach, I know I scared you off with that whole Naked Thursday's thing, but we don't have to do that!
Yeah, I guess it is. Listen, I ah, I gotta say good bye, and-and I gotta say it quick 'cause this is killing me. One thing you gotta know, is that I will never forget you. But, you've got things you have to do now, and so do I. And so... I'm gonna get on this spaceship, and I'm gonna go to Blargon 7 in search of alternative fuels. But when I return, 200 years from now, you'll be long gone. But I won't have aged at all. So you tell your great-great-granddaughter to look me up, because Adrienne, baby, I'm gonna want to meet her.
What?
Cool.
You wanna eat? My treat!
Good, otherwise my watch would fall off.
Gettin' drunk and going to a strip club.
Hey! How you doin'?
Hey!!
Why don't you go see Frankie? My family's been goin' to him forever. He did my first suit when I was 15. No wait, 16. No, 'scuse me, 15. All right, when was 1990?
Beth, Beth dies?
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa, I-I-Hey! I did not go out with your wife! Okay? I went out with her!
All right, so we should go catch our movie.
Okay! When?!
Me too. In fact, I think I might be a little too comfortable.
Uh, I don't know. Ya see, it's just, see I was a regular on a soap opera y'know? And to go from that to this, I just... Plus, I'd have to wait on all my friends.
Probably Monica and Chandler.
Uhh, Chandler's not here.
Do you want me to want you to care?
Ohhhh man
Hey! You guys! Check it out, check it out! Guess which job I got.
Uh, uh, we'll flip for it. Ducks or clowns.
Oh.
Well we have to make room for the fresh ones.
Huh, Rach I got to say it's gonna take a lot of money for me to go out on a date with a dude.
He forgot to leave his grip size!
Hey!
Well, I think it's ridiculous that you haven't had sex in three and a half months.
Do you have any respect for your body?
Me too. Alright, whattaya got.
All right! There is something. I kinda had a dream, but I don't want to talk about it.
Oh no! How can she do that when she's never shown any interest in you?!?
So that's it! It's over! Everybody knows!
Hey, what time is it?
Yeah, come on, think about it. You're 18, okay, she's 44, when you're 36, she's gonna be 88.
We're playing Strip Happy Days Game!
In a minute!!
My identical hand twin! The person whose hands are exactly like mine! This thing is a gold mine!
I don't know, it smells good.
Yeah well next thing you know, he'll be telling you that your high heels are good for his posture!
Well, I had the audition but Gunther said I had to stay here and be in charge so he could go get his hair dyed. So, I went anyway, and then he fired me.
We've got a box.
Come on, we were great together. And not just at the fun stuff, but like, talking too.
Hey!
Boy, it was so hard not to laugh, I tell ya. Hey, hey, the place looks great!
Ooh, sorry! No-no-no, so close though, but-bye-bye!
You do, thanks.
Ah, y'know just in general people being gay, thing. I'm totally cool with that.
Hey, you're back too!
Well, I guess I could sleep with her... I mean, how could I do that?
No, no. He said "When are you gonna grow up and start being a mom?"
Y'know, you look familiar. Do I know you from somewhere?
Yeah, what's that about?
She keeps punching me.
All right, okay, now, we just have to make sure she doesn't find out some other way. Did you think about the trail?
No, look.
I know. Yeah, his name is Pat.
Aww, you guys are so cute!
You bet I do! I just ah, wasn't listening then, that's all.
Yeah. Yeah.
Oh, yeah, that. All right, means that much to ya, I'll let you have her.
We love you, man.
Yeah.
Hey.
Yeah and the most important thing is that it won't be some like, stranger up there who barely knows you. It'll be me! And I swear I'll do a really good job. Plus, y'know I love you guys and-and it would really mean a lot to me.
Hey! I'm off to my audition. How do I look?
Oh umm, not go.
Well. I guess you think you're pretty special huh? Sittin' up here in your fancy small hall building. Makin' stars jump through hoops for ya, huh? Well y'know what? This is one star who's hoop... This is a star that the hoop-this hoop-I was Dr. Drake Remoray!
That's how they do pants! Ross, will you tell him? Isn't that how they measure pants?
What?! Noooo...
Die Hard!!!!!!
That's so sweet. I'm gonna get some coffee.
I can't believe I'm hearing this!
She's right in there.
Are you all right?
See you in 2003.
Hey Phoeb's, I think you're good to go.
Any one of the brilliant actresses nominated for this award tonight deserves to take it home. Unfortunately only one can. The nominees for Best Supporting Actress are from Passions Erin Goff. From One Life to Live Mary Loren Bishop , from All My Children Sarah Mchann, and from Days of Our Lives Jessica Ashley. And the winner is......Jessica Ashley from Days of Our Lives. Uh, unfortunately Jessica couldn't be with us tonight so I'll be accepting this award on her behalf. And I'm sure that Jessica would like to thank my parents who always believed in me. She'd also like to thank my friends, Chandler, Monica, Ross, Phoebe, and Rachel who's sittin' right there!
You're kiddin'.
Wh? Monday, one day. Tuesday, two day. Wednesday, when huh what? Thurs- Oh!
Oh, what did I say?
Yeah! Y'know, she could use a little... Oh nice shot!!!
So, you'd hire me, right?
Hey.
.....Well, this is still ruined, right?
Yeah, well, it feels different.
They know you know.
Oh, y'know, when we did that was when that bird was flying overhead with the fish in his mouth. Did you see it? It was gross!
Hey!
You're right! That did cheer me up!
No way. I've been going to the guy for 12 years.
No.
That's ridiculous! I'm not a "Star," just a regular famous actor.
No way! Mr.Salty is a sailor, all right, he's got to be, like, thetoughest snack there is.
Say hello to Reverend Joey Tribbiani!
Well, the movie got shutdown because they ran out of money, so I'm working here 'til it starts up again, if it ever does.
Wow, that was kinda brutal.
Uh, can I talk to you for a second, over there?
Yeah, well...
Nice, nice. Hey I got somethin' for you. [hands Chandler an envelope.
Hey! Hey!!
Ross, hey, the band's ready outside for your first dance with Emily, so...
Yeah. What time are you meeting her?
There was a seen in Footloose...
Boy that Julie's a talker, huh?
Hey, it's a lot harder than it looks! Okay? She-she-she's hurting me.
Hi!
Oh, you want something serious. Y'know what you should do, you should get her one of those um, barium enemas. Those are dead serious.
Oh. Are you sure you don't want to come? Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan, they get mail and stuff.
All right, I guess I can hold out a little longer. Let's have a game.
Well down at the adult video place down on Bleaker.
Hey Mon! Want some pancakes?
Check this out? Huh? Yeah. That's the stuff. What do you think?
I don't know! But it's the same!
Well, I think we've all learned something about who's disgusting and who's not. Eh? All right, now, I'm going to get back to my bucket. I'm only eating the skin, so the chicken's up for grabs.
Okay wait-wait p-please be cool! Okay? I work with this woman.
Y'know, there's two women dude.
Y-y-yeah! Yeah you do.
Who's Elaine?
Yes, it's a highly controversial procedure.
You want me to lie to Chandler?
Ross and I were helping the girls pack, took a little break, I lost $1,500 to him in Cups!
That's ridiculous!
Ohhh.
Oh yeah? Ross, how many items left in that bag?
So what? Look, suppose we were a divorced couple.
Ooh, you smell great tonight. What're you wearing?
Hey, Julie, I didn't know you wore lenses.
Yeah, yeah. We went to a Mets game, we got Chinese food, and you know, I love this woman. You have got competition buddy.
That's not what she said last night.
They have a kid together, y'know. They're like, they're like a family, and if, I don't know, there's chance they could make that work, I know I wouldn't want to be the guy who stood in the way of that. Are you okay? Do you wanna ah, come poke a nude guy?
Argh-argh!! Ooh, soft. Is this mink?
What, you think I'm gonna tell a girl I like that I'm also seeing a cup?
How you doin'?
Cut it out Ross! I hate to have to save your life and kick your ass in the same day!
Sure, it's hard to forget! But that doesn't mean you have to talk about it! A lot of things happened on that trip that we should never, ever talk about.
Hey.
What?!
Ohhh. Ahh! What are you doing?! I thought you were gonna take her back to the store today.
Yeah, unless you hook up with a bunch of pigeons.
Oh-Wha-Ho! What are you middle naming me for?! I left you a note!
I'd love to show ya, but I just tucked her in. She's sleeping. Hey uh, would you two girls like to go for a drink?
Okay, okay, fine! Make jokes, I don't care! This is a big break for me!
I'm surprised you didn't go home wearing your lunch.
Uh huh.. uh huh... oh my God! Okay! Okay, I'll be there! That was my agent. My agent has just gotten me a job...in the new Al Pacino movie!
And I ate the food, I had the fish, it was good, yeah. It was good, yeah...
46. Wow! Who's well educated now, Mr. I-forgot-ten-states?
What about Ross? I mean, are you still mad at him cause he made that list about you?
Yeah! Yeah. I'll be all right.
Oh, uh, hey Rach. I uh, I was just coming over here to uh... Oh wait, I don't have to lie to you, you don't live here anymore. Uh, I'm eating their food. What are you doing?
Ross good, I'm uh glad you're here. I wanna talk to you about something.
Yep, it's fat. I drank fat!
Man, we gotta do something about that guy. This morning, I caught him looking into our apartment. It creeps me out! I feel like I can't do stuff!
Okay, everybody just keep smiling. It'll kill my grandmother if she finds out.
You guys got anything to eat? I just went down to Johnos for some chicken and it was closed!
Yeah? That's so nice!
C'mon, she's your mom!
All right. Chandler, do you remember how I told you about our fridge?
Ross, you need some help?
No, not that one. We're trying to figure out who to bring to the Knicks game tonight, we have an extra ticket.
It does in mine!
You?! And-and you?!
I knew I shouldn't have mentioned it! That's what I wanted to name my kid!
That's right, mister, and I don't care how old you are, as long as you're under my roof you're gonna live by my rules. And that means no sleeping with your girlfriend.
Wouldn't you pay good money to see these identical hands showcased in some type of a uh, entertainment venue?
It's not a cat!
Maybe you'll order a little sangria?
Oh. Okay. Hey, can I ride this outside?
Oh, I know...
What? No! No Ross! No-no! Stop! I'm not jumping! Okay, look I have an audition tomorrow and I can't go if I break my leg.
Uhhh.. y'know what? Forget about me. Let's, uh... let's give you another turn.
The Estelle Leonard Talent Agency. Wow, an agency left me its card! Maybe they wanna sign me!
Ooh!
I said name one!
Clear the tracks for the boobie payback express. Next stop: Rachel Green.
I don't know! I really want this part! And they tell you no matter what you get asked at an audition you say yes. Like if-if they want you to ride a horse, you tell 'em you can! And just figure out how to do it later.
Yeah, life's pretty great isn't it?
Doctor? Wow! I didn't know he had a nickname.
All right, huddle up, right over here.
No, it's just ah, I care so damn much about little Ben that uh, it was more important to see him succeed.
No, things are fine with Kathy. I'm having a late dinner with her tonight, right after my early dinner with Casey.
No, as part of the audition. See, I'm up for this part of this guy, who the main guy kisses.
Okay, may I see the comics?
So you're playing a little Playstation, huh? That's whack! Playstation is whack! 'Sup with the whack Playstation, 'sup?! Huh? Come on, am I 19 or what?!
Just a, uh... hearing disability.
Yeah!
Come on, season tickets! Season tickets, do you know what that means?
Hey.
Hey! So, what's with the 20 percent tip? Did I do something wrong?
All right!
Kristen Lang.
I don't know, I just always pictured you ending up with one of those tall, smart blond guys, name like.... Hoyt.
Say it... say it!
Wait, wait, wait!
Hey.
Yeah
Thank you! Well, I guess now I know who I'm taking to the awards.
Six and a half! You knocked that last one out of my hand! Remember?
I like that! Oh, okay! Show him your bra! He's afraid of bras! Can't work 'em!
Oh sure, right back there.
Hey!
Alright, when'd'ya have it on last?
What do ya say? What do ya say?
OK, alright, the people who threw the water.
Wow, this is wild. What're you gonna get?
I can't believe you didn't know it was a line!
But hey, thanks for teachin' us Cross-Eyed Mary. You guys, we gotta play that at our regular game.
I don't think so.
Hey, you're ah, pretty good at this.
Uhhh, I don't think you're gonna like this.
Hey!
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Let her dangle.
No! No! I-I can do it one more time! See? Look! Hmm, noodle soup. Damnit!
Okay, now the Mastodon is from the semi-late Jurassic period.
All right, you know what we gotta do? We gotta get you outta here. Come on, I'll buy you breakfast, let's go.
Excellent, I'll be there.
I fall down an elevator shaft? What the hell does this mean, I fall down an elevator shaft?
That just cost me four bucks. But uh listen, I just called to see how the chick and the duck are doing?
I can't write! Y'know I mean I-I-I'm an actor, I don't have the discipline that takes, y'know? I can't do it.
Good, me too. Eggs and milk are in the fridge. Thanks.
I think you did.
Well my old man is doing a plumbing job down there and he heard they have an opening. So, you want me to see if I can get you an interview?
All right! Thanks! You're the best! Now listen, the last day of auditions is Thursday. Okay? So I gotta get in there by Thursday. Okay? Just remember Thursday. Thursday. Can you remember Thursday?
Joe Stalin. Y'know, that's pretty good.
I wanna rock and roll all night!
Yeah.
Yeah.
They're so small!
Hi!
How come the writing is in Spanish?
Sure. Yep.
I finally get a part on TV and the monkey's makin' movies.
Wow! Well, my folks really liked it! So what-what did you guys think? It wasn't that good.
I told ya.
Yep.
Yeah, it's like a cow's opinion. It just doesn't matter. It's moo.
Her name is Dutch, and also Marklan.
Hey.
Yeah! Much! Listen uh, not that I'm y'know insecure about my manhood or anything y'know, but I think I need to hook up with a woman like right now.
Hey.
Wh-why?
Not the other one?
I don't get it! It was in my room all night! And if she didn't take it, and I didn't take it; and you didn't take it, then who did? Shh! We're trying to think!
Hey, Ross, want some cider?
How's that different? Oh! Yeah!
Yeah, hi. You guys got any of those baby chicks? 'Cause I was watching this ah, commercial on TV and man, those guys are cute!
You meant sex, right?
You know, uh... Chandler got you a gift, too.
Good for you!
Well I don't know remember exactly but, it's-it's pretty much about having and giving and sharing and receiving.
Well, I think it went pretty well. I.. I got a callback for Thursday.
Oh-no, don't try and talk all normal with that thing in your ear.
Hmm.
What, what is it?
Okay look, Chandler, if this you have got to listen! You're gonna throw that juice at me, aren't ya?
Wow! Look at this! He wrote a check for 50,000 dollars to Hugo Ligrens Ring Design. Oh, sorry, what do you think the good news is?
What the hell is in there?
But only in the moment. So do ya wanna kiss again?
All right!
Yeah! Oh my God! Is this what it's like to be you?
Isn't it? And it's engraved too, check it out.
All right, I'm sorry. Rach I-Rach I'm sorry. Okay? I'm sorry! Maybe I can make up for it by, taking you roughly in the barn.
Same kind of thing happened to me! Woman pizza delivery guy come over, gives me the pizza, takes the money, and leaves!
Thirty seconds left on the timer!
Y'know what I think? I think somebody's got a little crush on Casey. How 'bout I fix you two up? What do you think?
Hey, y'know in Roman times this was more than just a hat.
I wanna gooooooo!
Hey, Chandler, that table place closes at 7, come on.
But I got to act with a robot Pheebs, and-and I don't know anything about technology! I can't even use Chandler's computer except to find porn! And-and that's only 'cause it's right there when you turn it on!
Ross?
Yeah, lady, I do! I got a problem with that!
Oh, I don't know.... Yeah, can't do it.
Hey, Felicity.
'Cause I figured you'd hooked up with some girl and she'd left it there.
Shhh! Man, you made me lose it!
Yeah it is. . . what?
Exellent dream score.
Okay.
Man, it must be so cool remembering stuff like that! I don't have any past life memories.
Hey!
What are we supposed to be seeing here?
$200? Are you sure Pheebs? I mean, after what Sesame Street did to ya?
Wow.
That's it, just hey. Like at the end of a dance, HEY! Hey. He-hey.
Yeah! Well, well really it's three. Please. You're so good at it. I love you.
Okay!
All right!
So what, like people are gonna come in and think, "Uh-oh, I'm outside again?" Of course!
Hey!
Okay, first-first of all, you want to make it look spontaneous. I look down , look down, keep looking down; then I look up. See? All right, now you try. Look down , you're looking down, keep looking down...
Hey.
Oh, you bet I am!
Yes! I will have the lobster ravioli.
Huh. But still Ross, you're worst day with two women, pretty much better than any other day! Y'know what I mean?
I know...
I'm sorry, I just...I like things the way they are.
Are you kidding me?! She's gonna this boat!
What? My hands are totally clean, I just gave the duck a bath.
Where have you been?
"Warden, in five minutes my pain will be over. But you'll have to live with the knowledge that you sent an honest man to die."
Y'know I don't think you should be talking at all in there! I think you've got to much thinking to do to be talking and making jokes!
Mine!
That's kinda nice.
Apparently, there's like a million guys out there that can play Mac, and there's only this one robot and this one guy who controls it! I didn't know he could get me fired! What am I going to do?
Y'know what? Make fun all you want. This is a great bag! Okay? And it's as handy as it is becoming. Now, just because you don't understand something, doesn't make it wrong. All right? So from now on you guys are gonna have to get used to the fact that Joey, comes with a bag!
Ah, the stalker.
Wait, here's one. Uh, would you be willing to cook naked?
Not like him, per-se, just not un-like him.
Oh God. Uh, okay, here's the thing, this is the thing, okay, the thing is...
She's comin'.
There's gravy?
Like the three musketeers, only with fruit.
No! No! I am not a sex addict!
Damnit!
...I'm his butt double. 'Kay? I play Al Pacino's butt. Alright? He goes into the shower, and then- I'm his butt.
Hey Pheebs, guess who we saw today.
Yeah! Well, I think we'll see if they actually let you play. Huh? I mean they tell you anything you want to hear like-like, "You look 19," and then they just take it away like-like, "No you don't."
Okay...
Dude! I am trying to sleep!
Well, when it's not right, you know it.
We're now in the ceremony, Monica is about to say, "I do" when her drunk uncle starts yelling. What do you do? Go!
I'm...happy...for you?
Hey, what have you guys been up too?
Hey, do we do this too much?
Well, this guy came by to look at the unit and-and he said he didn't think big enough to fit a grown man!
Oh yeah? If I can't, I'll knock five bucks off the price off the unit.
Oh what, wait, wait a second, I mean, what are we doing? Who's going with who?
What?!
Uh-oh, shht! The Misses.
Sure you do, it was a gift from me. Oh! And you have these three great kids.
Well I guess I should've thought about my wife and kids before I talked back to chef Geller!
All right, look I'm sorry you guys, but it's just that I gotta get these new head shots made. And they're really expensive, y'know? I'm down to like three! Well, actually two 'cause one of 'em I kinda blackened in some teeth-Why did I do that?!
That's a really long time.
You a little sad about that sweetheart?
And you'll be topless?
Hey-hey, Ross?
Okay, good, so there you go. Go with Vince.
You know there already is a Joseph Stalin?
Hey.
Pheebs! Wait up! Listen uh, close your eyes. Maybe that's one thing you can cross off your list.
Can I ask you something?
Is ah, is Chandler around?
Hey!
Yeah.
And the duck gets the Nutter-Butter!
Thanks man.
So, are you ready to go?
A hamster? What, those things are like 10 bucks.
I mean come on you guys! My own TV show? I just don't know if I'm good enough.
Ohhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!
Ok.
Hi Ben! So you wanna be an actor huh? I gotta tell ya, it's no picnic. There's tons of rejection. No stability. One day you're Dr. Drake Remoray, the next day you're eating ketchup right out of the bottle.
Now, wait a second! You make food and robots?
That's 'cause sometimes I just do it through my wall to freak you out.
Kinda, but I've just been having way too much fun.
Ah, Gunther, I can't pay for this right now because I'm not working, so I've had to cut down on some luxuries like uh, payin' for stuff.
All right well, I guess I gotta go get a job. I'm gonna go see my agent.
Ten. Okay. Now Tag there's such a thing as to many women.
If he goes first he can!
Yeah! Okay! Hey! Hi!
What the?!
Hey, so how'd it go with Julie? Did you, did you break her heart?
I'm gonna be in the waitin' room, handing out cigars.
Yeah, but I don't wanna die!
You could?
Hey Ross, listen, you know that right now, your baby's only this big? This is your baby. Hi Daddy!
Why don't we just go on two.
It's like if you woke up one day and found out your dad was leading this double life. He's like actually some spy, working for the C.I.A. That'd be cool.... This blows!
Guys! Guys!! You gotta let me nap! Ugh, I'm gonna get cranky!
I mean, the giant is like five years younger than me, y'know, you think I'll ever get there?
Look I don't know this baby. I don't know if she's a famous artist or not. You know, and I don't want to be a jerk but you're changing too much around here.
What? I have seven Catholic sisters. I've taken care of hundreds of kids. Come on, we wanna do it, don't we?
Oh, nothing, no. It's an acting exercise, I'm practising my fake laugh.
Hi! How are the Gellers?
No! I would never do that! You-you're like my brother!
....yeah... what else?
Noo! Nothing!
Well, I can't do everything! Look back over your time together.
Dan just moved in downstairs. Yeah, he just got back from like this four-month trek in the Andes. Nice fella.
Oh my God! You're pregnant!
Yeah, we haven't dropped it in...
Yeah, three days on the lake without a shower. Plus! I fell in that big tub of worms at the bait stand! Hey, how-how's he doing?
Yeah.
Hi, how ya doing?
Okay. I went down to the 'Mattress King' showroom and, and I saw Janice, kissing her ex-husband.
Well, we can talk about something else. What do you want to talk about? Vivisection? The Vasdeferens? The Vietnam War?
Really? I don't...
And it's not fake, it's totally brutal.
Where is the waitress?! I'm starving!
Needs some clothes altered?
Well, I was thinking about that and I, I think the best way would be, to not.
Hey.
My Giant? I love that movie!
Oh, it was so amazing. After the love making...
What? What's wrong?
London baby!!
Rach we had to get out of there because, look what I won!
You guys! You guys! You're not gonna believe what my agent just told me!
That's not a bad idea. Yeah. Okay, but if I got to turn on the charm tomorrow I'm not wasting anymore of it over here with you guys. Well, actually I got a little bit saved for you Pheebs.
No, but if you're willing to cook naked, then you might be willing to dance naked. And then...
Oohh!! Ohh! Oh-oh-oh! Oh-oh!!
Really? You'd-you'd do that for me?!
All right back off! I gotta gun! I'm not afraid to use it!
Why God?! Why are you doing this to us?!
Oh. Okay. Ooh! Ooh! Okay, maybe I'll talk about London! Y'know when you two hooked up! Only, only I won't say hooked up. I'll say, "Began their beautiful journey..."
No, Pheebs, listen, if you decide to do this, we'll be supportive like crazy.
All right, it's another commercial; I still haven't told her!
Glove salesman!
It's better! You can't go to a museum in your underwear!
Think it'll work?
So I just talked to one of the DOOL writers today, and...
Ewwwww!
What? Rachel, listen, have you ever heard of Fortunata Fashions?
Huh.
Huh?!
Yeah, he's just really great to hang around with.
You serious?
Not so much.
Okay, all right.
And you're not supposed to be gossiping!!
To her parent's I think and she said you shouldn't call her. But if I were you I would.
He hooked up!! Tell us about her!
What are they doing out here? The coast's all the way over there.
And deaf!
Yeah?! So's yours!
No, I wasn't gonna ask you that, no.
It's not what you said. It's the way you said it....Oh My God, I'm a woman!!!
Well, since you ask. They want me back on Days of Our Lives!
Hey, kids...
Hey!
Yeah, did I fool ya?
Marcel?
Whoa-whoa, but her birthday isn't like for another month.
Look at this, how did I spend so much money?
Hey! I did not cry my eyes out!! Come on! It's like the end of an era! No more J-man and Channie's!!
Hey Phoebs.
Hello Mr. Bing...I love you.
Yeah! And hey, thanks for coming with me. And thanks again for helping me take a shower.
Oh that's on the house courtesy of Joey Tribbiani.
It's ah, step-ity, step and jazz hands.
What?!
I don't know. Just uh, just tell 'em it was a mix-up with the invitations, or-No-no-no! Blame it on the post office. They hate the post office. And the Irish! But I don't think you can blame it on them so...
Umm, okay.
I'm telling ya, you guys are totally getting back together!
Oh we kissed it up real nice.
Hey, it's gonna be all right.
So, you're just Bing?
Surprise!!
Yes! Yeah, it's like they're always saying "let's go here, let's go there". Like we can afford to go here and there.
No-no! No way! Joey Tribbiani does not take charity...anymore.
Hey!!
Oh!
Pheebs! Sorry!
Ohh yeah, that's the stuff.
A monkey.
"...when I look back over our time together..."
Hard to tell, I was naked.
Sorry. Monica and Chandler are making love.
Which, is the new plan!
Good, and hey! My treat. But that's only because you're not eating anything, right?
Hi.
If you ask me, as long as you got this job, you've got nothing pushing you to get another one. You need the fear.
Phoebe here with the cab yet?
Chandler is a complex fellow, one who is unlikely to take a wife.
Ooh-ooh, Pheebs, you want a strong name? How about, The Hulk?
I'm always on the swings! What am I doing wrong?!
Oh really! Where? Somewhere funny I'd bet!
No ma'am.
Hey guys. Listen uh, you wanna get some dinner with me and Kathy tonight?
Hi. I'm Joey Tribbiani; I'm here to audition for man.
Wait a minute! Wait a minute! We have a winner!
Oh. That is quite a situation. Uh, do you see any like, powder?
Nah, you're not tall enough to be a Mark, but you might make a good Barney.
What do you mean?
Yeah. Uh, ...a slice......six dollars?
All right, I guess this will be fine.
Oh man!
Hey.
There y'go, kids.
Oh, it was amazing. You know how you always think you're great in bed?
Anyone mind if I save this?
We did it!!
Dude, Phoebe's mom has got a huge peni...
What?!
I've gotta see this. All right Ugly Naked Guy!
Oh, you should here me.
Cool.
Hey!
Really?
Yeah, but it's my wax.
Dude, you're not even man enough to order the channel that carries the sport.
Hey, I was pretty close. Uhh, so bad news. Umm, I can't buy the boat, I don't have any money.
She was kidding about that right?
Really? I can do it?
Uh, yeah, okay. Except I sorta felt like I needed a couple of seconds to get ready.
Can't help you, I'm not wearing any.
Maybe, my ruler's wrong.
It is???
You'd tell me if you were moving out right
Noooo. No-no-no, these babies sell themselves.
Yeah-yeah, absolutely.
It's the big night! We wanted to wish you good luck!
No, not really. They give you all the information, it's uh, it's like memorizing a script. "And on your left, you have Tyrannosaurus Rex, a carnivore from the Jurassic period.
Hey you guys. Hey, you all know my dad, right?
Come on Pheebs! I can't take this anymore! Let-let me make it up to you. Huh? Ground control to Major Tom. Commencing countdown, engines on. Take your protein pills and put your helmet on!
How is it you?
Yeah. Bijan for men?
Ooh, I was gonna say bologna, but that's much better. How about a little of that smoked turkey?
Ooh, Ross, look! Look!
Look-look-look you guys, I need some help! Okay? Someone is going to have to convince my hand twin to cooperate!
Oh, hold up, I'll walk out with you. Now, Rach, when she taught you to kiss, you were at camp, and.. were you wearing any kinda little uniform, or- That's fine, yeah...
Oh, how bad is it?
Hey.
Oh well, Chandler and Monica are over there and it's kinda hard to concentrate.
I don't think so.
So, you were both dorks. Big deal.
Look, it's not about her. Okay? But seeing you two together just reminds me of what you did. And I don't want to live with some one who doesn't know what it is to be a friend. So, I'll see ya.
I Gotcha!!
Well, how long do you think it'll be?
Thanks. Thanks, but uh actually it's just gonna be me again tonight.
Uh, boat rope.
Why not?
Well, I sorta am. I mean yeah, I'm dating this girl who's also seeing another guy. But, I don't know, I'm not to worried about it.
Okay. Okay, I totally hear ya. Oo how about this? I vamp a little 'til they get there?
Well, they go into the chipper.
Fuggetaboutit. How you doin?
Sorry, I just, any excuse to tell that story y'know....
Can we see her?
Really?
Aaaaagggghhhhh. Mommy
What?
All right! Now hey, I need to use the bathroom. Since I don't need any assistance in there, take a break!
Okay.
Joey. Joey. Joey. Joey! Joey!!
So Pheebs, where are you doing all, your bell ringing?
Oh, it's great! It's a great place to just kinda, sit, hang around, drink a few beers, eat some chips.
What?!
Monica, how are you gonna do that?
That's great, but isn't it gonna bother that people still think you're a porn star?
Have you seen Monica?
Well all right then, I guess I shouldn't get to excited about the fact that I just kissed her!
Not in my head.
"Take could care of your Momma son." "Take could care of your Momma son." "Come on son! Your Momma's good people!"
Hey no problem.
Oh hey, no, you're not welcome. Okay, look, I hate this! You guys keep embarrassing me! Yesterday, Rachel found your razor in our bathroom and I didn't know what to say, so I said it was mine and-and that I was playing a woman in a play. And one thing led to another and
Because Vincent, we were lovers. For two years!
Well actually...
Yeah. I'll uh, I'll call ya.
Huh.
What?
Hey Ross, listen, you want anything to drink, 'cause I'm heading up there.
Phoebe!
Hey, listen, lady.... ...whoa.
Yep. I just, I just watched her sleep for like hours, just breathing in and breathing out. And then I knew she was dreaming 'cause, 'cause her eyes keep going like this.
Oh-whoa-wait, Gunther don't-don't forget your shirt.
Likewise. Uh, I'll take that. It's what I came for. So, this is new. Where'd you two meet?
Did I get it?
Uhh, are you saying that you're not entirely happy about this?
Nope.
Of course! Only an idiot would wear this stuff if you didn't have the car! Right?
Felicity and I, we're watching My Giant, and I was thinking, "I'm never gonna be as good an actor as that giant." Do you think I'm just wasting my life with this acting thing?
No, I-I just heard lunch. But yeah, I can go. Sure!
Barmifsaed?
All right! Man, this is unbelievable!
Alright, alright, hey y'know fair is fair, if you're right, you're right, what can I say, but hey oh no!
Is that true? If I keep reading is Beth gonna die?
No, only for sex.
Okay.
Come on! It'll be fun! Me, you, and Ross, and... Paul probably...
Why? Is it because I'm friends with Phoebe?
Yeah, if I'm willing to sleep with the casting lady.
It's like, you got so many lines to learn so fast, that sometimes you need a minute to remember your next one. So while you're thinkin' of it, you take this big pause where you look all intense, you know, like this.
Here, I brought you some flowers.
I call Monica's room!
I got you something! Open it! Open it!
Ok ok ok ok. Monica, we'll bring him, but only if he takes the Jaguar.
No you're not! Not to me!
Uh, y'know, starve a fever, go to a play for a cold.
Why do you have to break up with her? Be a man, just stop calling.
Yeah, all right. Ooh!
Yeah.
Hi.
Oh!
No.
Uh, waiter, one more plate of chicken wings over here.
That's...kinda hot.
You talked to him. Are you crazy?
Not a problem.
Tampa Bay's got a terrible team.
Oh mommie, oh daddie, I am a big old baddie! Oh mommie, oh daddie, I am a big old baddie!
No! I'm up for a Soapie!
All right relax, look I'll pay you with the money from the acting job I am definitely gonna get thanks to you.
Who?
Hey. Hey look I am still Joey, okay. Flowers they're just, you know, they're nice to look at. And that happens to be a picture by a famous artist. Of a famous baby.
Oh my God! I cannot believe you guys are talking about this! The problems in the bedroom are between the man and the woman!!! All right?!! Now Chandler is doing the best he can!!
I don't care, Rach! Look, I am tired of being the guy who knows all the secrets but can't tell anyone!
I'm sorry, it just-I don't know it doesn't really look like it can do anything.
Ahhhhhhhhhh...
Uhhh, mine too! Yeah.
You and Rachel.
Hey you guys, check it out. Check it out. It's like it's coming right at me.
Okay, imagine the best sex you've ever had.
That wasn't a real date?! What the hell do you do on a real date?
You went through my personal property?
Hey!
Well, that is usually what I would do. But I just never thought you'd be on the receiving end of it. How could you do this?!
Closeness-shmoshness! There was three of us for crying out loud!
Oh uh, me and Ross can be the judges.
Absolutely! And if it doesn't, can I get the extra ticket?
Will you grow up? I'm not talking about sexy stuff, but, like, when I'm cooking naked.
Yeah, poor cat, never saw that big butt coming.
Look we've got to find her. Phoebe just called!! Rachel's coming to tell Ross she loves him!!
Ross has a boyfriend.
Yeah?
Eww! Look, I'm asking a favor here. If I do this for her brother, maybe Angela will come back to me.
What happened? What happened?
Okay.
Yeah, it's mine.
What?
But I counted, you're not supposed to live here! Oh man!
Hey! Well I hope it goes better than the last time you did it for that girl downstairs, remember?
They gave me the shaft all right.
Bikini, French cut, thong! And-and the fabrics! You've got cotton, silk, lace! And y'know what I've always wondered about?
Okay.
Gotcha.
All right now remember, something this big and long is going to be difficult to manuver, fortunately I have a lot of experience in that area.
Hi, Lauren.
Nothing, he's just really believes in that.
All right, well I guess I'll just have to do what I do on dates.
And a 50. Huh, these must be Chandler's pants.
Damnit Phoebe!!
Sorry.
no. No, I, I couldn't do that.
No, I'm not questioning it, I'm saying it's stupid! What?!
Yeah, you're gonna go up to her and say, "Here's your egg back, I'm returning your egg."
Hey! Wanna play some foosball? Please?
Gimme a box a juice. Well, they switched me over to Hombre.
Oh.
Something like that?
Hey! Is the show still on?
Thanks!
But it's available now! Isn't it?
Oh, her ankles are a little chubby.
Finally!
And?
Oh thanks. Thanks. It was great meetin' ya. And listen if any of my friends gets married, or have a birthday, or a Tuesday...
What is the matter with you?!
Vulva?
Cage closed?
Yes! Shame about you man.
Am I in it?
What are you talkin' about? I never left you! You've always been my agent!
Oh right great! Welcome aboard!
I'm Joey.
Is she great or what?
A book? Is it like a book that's also a safe?
See? That's a great smile! Easy. Natural. Now, pretend I have a camera. You're changing it!
So, you saw me on Days Of Our Lives huh? Want me to, want me to do a little Dr. Drake Remoray for ya?
Wow, that's, uh, dirty.
Oh-ho! I bet the British version is gooooood!
Okay.
My god, Angela.
Hey, you're not Kip!
I know, Monica told me.
What's in it?
I'm so sorry. Look, if it was up to me you would never leave the show.
You hug me!
Really? Who-who have you taught?
I know I don't have too! It tastes good.
Hello.
Oh hi!
Yeah.
But my mom always makes them. It's like a tradition. You get a little piece of turkey on your fork, a little cranberry sauce, and a tot! It's bad enough I can't be with my family because of my disease.
Yeah?
Check it out, Giants-Cowboys.
Hey, don't get religious on me, ok. A guy in your position needs to be a little better at relaxing. You know. Why do you think we have the comfortable chairs? Huh...come here...sit down. Ready? Ahh!! Ohh, yeah!! Huh?!
Yeah-yeah-yeah, and they had that beer! That uh...
You forget how many great songs Heart had.
Every night!!
Yes, I'm afraid it is. You deserve much better than me Erica. You deserve to be with the real Drake, he's the one you fell in love with. Go to Salem, find him, he's the guy for you.
The reactor's gonna blow in three seconds, we're never gonna make it!
Oh yeah, sure, that makes sense. Yeah. 'Cause you already told her you love her and she didn't say it back, then she called you and told you that there's another guy, so yeah, go to London that'll scare her!
Ross! So when is it gonna air?
Yeah, and I'm a little tired from digging the hole.
Gotcha. Phoebs, walk with me.
No, don't be sorry. I don't need it anymore. I found my identical hand twin!
Well, what if they came in third in a modeling contest?
Well, I ain't gonna say no to that.
Okay! How you doin'?
It was unbelievable! I walked in there and she was all over me.
That is incredible! You are the master!
Yeah I did!
I can't tell you what I know.
Look now, Phoebe remember, hey, their just fulfilling their Christmas....
Hey!
Whoa-ho-ho! Yeah, okay.
I can't decide which route to take to Vegas. Hey, you've traveled a lot right?
I know.
See ya!! What the hell was that?!
Noooo!!
Your other student, was you!
Hey!
Phoebe! We're both your backup?!
I don't wanna hear it! Now go to my room!
Yeah, that was real.
I wish. See, I guess another thing I probably should've told you about Ginger is that she kinda has a ah, artificial leg.
Just trying to get comfortable. I can't sleep in my underwear.
I'm takin' Ursula tonight. It's her birthday.
Come on! Who has the biggest boobs?
Well to tell you the truth, they uh, they had a problem with the bag!
Oh my God, you guys have no idea.
Ah!! Okay! Eyes open at all times! Oh, hey, how do we decide where we... y'know each would, y'know be?
So! Stryker Remoray huh? When do you want me to start?
No!
Well, remember when they got in that big fight and broke up and we were all stuck in her with no food or anything? Well, when Ross said Rachel at the wedding, I figured it was gonna happen again, so I hid this in here.
Pheebs, he seems to enjoy it.
Oh, y'know the same thing happened to me one time.
You cuddled.
Chandler? What're you still doin' here, I though you guys took off.
Thank God! I'm exhausted!
Yeah, I didn't know you guys were going to be here.
Hey guys!
Yeah.
Rachel, would you stop saying that?! Hey-hey look, remember on the show when-when Caprice was dying and she gave me...
Hey, you guys are still gonna come visit me, right?
Hi!
Oh that's too bad. I've kinda been saving up. Uh, are you sure there's no studies I can participate in?
Wow! That's pretty nice. I thought he cut off his ear 'cause he sucked. What else you got in there?
Hey.
In the dream I did enjoy the closeness.
I bet that kiss isn't looking like such a big mistake now, is it?
Yes!!! Ha-ha-ha!
I thought we talked about this. I don't like pulp. No pulp. Pulp isn't juice. All juice, okay?
Chandler?
That kinda sounds like your dream dude.
What?! He got to do it at your first wedding!
Hey! So Estelle lined up a bunch of auditions for me tomorrow and I'll have my health insurance back in no time.
It's never gonna happen.
Nothing, why?
Dr. Drake Remoray. Days of Our Lives. Voted most datable neurosurgeon by Teen Beat.
Hey!
You don't kiss your friend's mom! Sisters are okay, maybe a hot-lookin' aunt... but not a mom, never a mom!
Oh I like this place. And technically, technically I'm not breaking any rules so I...
What is it?
Yeah!! I call that London style.
Yeah!!
Ha-ha. Are all you processors dorks?
Hey you guys.
I may have to, I hate to do it, but I'm the star! Y'know? There's a limit to how many sandwiches I can eat off the floor. Excuse me. Joey Tribbiani.
No. No, I just uh, I just loved the way it feels when everybody thinks I own a Porsche.
You just give him a spoon baby!
Okay. Have a benefit.
Ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah! Enh? All right, what do you think?
All right Carl, we're next. Now remember, what is not gonna be?
Well we'll see!
Oh no, no-no-no-no! I don't want to know!
Hey, y'know you could always visit him.
Fine. Gang up on me! I got you all right where I want you.
Sorry! Sorry.
Hey.
Come on man, you know I'd do it for you! Because, you're my best friend.
Dude, you should've gone out once and a while.
Well yeah, don't-don't you think it's a she?
But, hey, look, you know the good thing is, is that we spent the whole day together and I survived, and what's even more amazing, so did she. It was bat day at Shea Stadium.
Aw, man I'm sorry . This must be very tough for ya, huh .
And I gotta pay rent! Look, how-how about this? You don't fire me, instead I stay here, I gain their trust, and they'll start listening to all the nice things I've been saying about you.
That's right!
Look, I know I feel asleep before I could shower and now I don't have time! They're just ten blocks away, if I run, I can make it.
Sure it is! She needs a pen for work, she's writing, she turns it over.... "Whoa! It's time for my date with Joey!"
All right well, I'd better take that back.
Oh my God, quick turn off the TV.
Yeah, I guess, but what's like heads and what's tails?
He's right, cause if you're just gonna, like, break his heart, that's the kind of thing that can wait.
Hey, hey, check it out, guess what I got.
Somebody wanna help me out here?
Marcel, I'm hungry.
Sure I can, standard shotgun rules, I'm sight of the room and I called it.
No.
I Play Al Pacino's Butt. All Right? He Goes Into The Shower, And Then- I'M His Butt.
Phoebs, check it out, check it out, check it out, check it out.
Hard to tell, they're so tiny and upside-down. Wait, wait. They're walking away... they're walking away... No, no they're not, they're coming right at us! Run! Run!
Felicity and I, we're watching My Giant, and I was thinking, "I'm never gonna be as good an actor as that giant." Do you think I'm just wasting my life with this acting thing?
Someone like an...angel?
Here. Now I only owe you $49.50.
Sounds nice.
I want you to like her! But if that's too damned difficult for you, then the least you can do is pretend.
Naa, you're just sayin' that 'cause you're in love with Yasmine Blepe.
No! Because he didn't believe in my movie! Which is a big mistake because it is real! Real!
Alright, well next time you take a shower, think about the last thing I wash and the first thing you wash.
Well, I guess you're right. Maybe, maybe I'll take her down to the incinerator. It's gonna be so said, and kinda cool. She's heeled!
I know! My grandmother's gonna see this!
Services? Oh, services.
Wait, wait, wait. You want him, I want her. He likes you.
Well then maybe I will.
Estelle, you gotta get me some work. I-I lost my health insurance.
No problem. Hey Chandler
That is so not my motto.
Okay, you hide my clothes. I'm gonna do the exact opposite to you.
All right. I can't see.
How is "Monica, I love your sweet ass," inappropriate?
Ohh, hey! Why don't you book a date for both of you at one of those romantic spas?
I guess I'll get washed up then. Watch that sunrise.
I don't know! But it's the same!
I couldn't help it, there love is so pure.
Since always. It's like dating language. Y'know, like 'It's not you' means 'It is you'.
I didn't know it was an auction!
Hey, Monica, who would yours be?
Hey, we all had better plans. This was nobody's first choice.
All right, that's it! He cannot do this to Phoebe. This guy is going to get the butt kicking of a lifetime! But, is he a big guy?
Pizza!! We like Pizza!! Get out!!!
It's cute, huh?
What?!
Good luck, man.
Look, you and I have been given a gift. Okay? We have to do something with it. Like-like, hand modeling! Huh? Or-or magic! And you know NASA's gonna wanna talk to us!
Who knows?
Oh, I don't know Pheebs. It'll be okay.
So that's it? It's over? Just like that?
You pushed him!
Look, there's nothing I can do for him right now, he's still in his sweat pants, that's still Phase One. Y'know? I'll be back for Phase Two, I would never miss Phase Two.
Really?
Oh, hey! Joey Tribbiani.
Yeah, we look great together.
Pheebs! You're blocking the porn! Look out!
Yeah, sure. Well, you must be new here. Maybe we should-I'm sorry, can I ask you something?
I mean, the giant is like five years younger than me, y'know, you think I'll ever get there?
Oh-ooh, that's the turn-on.
Was she happy you gave her the job?
Well, who's to say what's true? I mean...
Yeah, yeah. It's like my chance to give something back to the acting community.
Well, you're timing couldn't be better. She's not my girlfriend anymore.
Look, my best friends are getting married in like an hour. Okay? And I'm the minister. Please! Please! Can you pull it together?
Thank you. Thank you.
What's the game?! What's the game?!
Beth is really, really sick.
Aaaaagggghhhhh.
Yeah?
Nothing. No, nothing.
Come on! Look just-just tell-let her know that you really want them to be there. Let's not forget, this is a woman that has sent you many lasagnas over the years.
What can I do? Look, I don't want to do anything to screw it up with Ursula.
Yeah. What are we getting?
Hey!
C'mon, you're going out with the guy! There's gotta be something wrong with him!
So did that do anything for ya?
Oh, all blank, and no blank, make's blank a blank blank. Oh no-no-no, no, the end when Jack almost kills them all with that blank, but then at last second they get away. Aww!
Hey Pheebs! Listen, uh can you do me a favor? I forgot the pin number to my ATM card can, can you get it for me?
"Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in!"
Yeah well, I'm guessing after this she's not going to be crazy about electricity either.
Hey-hey don't look at me! I just work here!
Instead of...?
I can give it a shot.
Put your hands together.
What?!
This is crazy.
Nah.
It's no big deal. Hey, y'know, you do what you gotta do. Right?
I don't know.
Really. Why can't we just get some pizzas and get some beers and have fun?
C'mon, you guys, it wasn't that bad. It was better than that thing I did with the trolls, at least you got to see my head.
All right, here we go.
Man, I didn't think we were gonna make it!
Hey.
That's horrible! Well, you did the right thing man.
Okay, is there anything else?
No-no hey buddy, please let me dance with that girl, I really like her and I think I have a shot.
Thank you!
I don't know Rach.
It's a woman.
Delicious.
Hey, cut him some slack. It was Chandler's idea.
I know! All right, I'll see you guys over there! I'm off to fight the Nazis.
Okay well that may be true. But, in-in okay, Air Force One the Russians were terrorists! And evil! And plus he kills a bunch of them! That-that-that's offensive to Russians.
Nooo!
Dude! Hernia operations cost like, a lot probably. Besides it's getting darker and more painful, that means it's healing.
Yeah!
I think I know that girl.
There are?
Uh, excuse me. Jerry is the director, which one's he?
Hey, Mr. Bing. That uh, hotel you stayed at called. Said someone left an eyelash curler in your room.
Well, actually the last place you were sitting was in there . Soo...
Oh yeah? If you're gonna make me choose between you and the hat? I choose the hat.
Yeah, she's been out there for twenty minutes, I'm surprised you didn't hear her on the way over.
Put it on.
I found my identical hand twin!
Hey, so listen, I went across the street and talked to the doorman- I got the peeper's name! Can I use the phone?
It just seems so futile, you know ? All these women, and nothing. I feel like Superman without my powers, you know? I have the cape, and yet I cannot fly.
Heh... I was bluffing.
Hey-hey dancer girl! Can I go to the bathroom? I just.. Here we go. Looking good Gellers!
He's talking to London!
I like it.
Hey! Who was up from 2 o'clock this morning until 5 o'clock this morning trying to get her back to sleep?
Hey, what happened to your fancy chef's jacket?
Wow!!
Thank you so much.
Yeah! In fact, to prove how much you mean to me, here.
This is impossible Monica, why don't you just pick all 15?
Ah whatever!
Somebody help me out here!
Yeah.
Yeah, this slow roasted salmon, just how slow are we talkin' here?
No, no, no, don't say "listen." I know that "listen." I've said that "listen."
Hey buddy! How's it going?
Look, we were way out of line, we totally support you.
Or clowns. Oh, oh wait. That one's definitely Ben. Remember, he had that cute little mole by his mouth.
I don't want them to move to a Volvo dealership!
Hey!! Hey-hey-hey!
Yeah.
The balloon?
That sounds perfect!
Hey!
Hey! Mine was by accident! All right, the boiler explodes and destroys the hotel, and kills the dad.
All right.
If you said it like that, you probably did, yeah.
An-an-anyway I-I just wanted to say that since I'm getting your brain when you leave the show, I was wondering if there was any tips you can give me...
It may not be a bed of roses.
That you're actually 50?
Mom, so what did you think?
Well, you might wanna make a little extra, y'know you'll probably be hungry after the sex.
Really? 'Cause I could kinda use the money.
Damn!
Oh.
Whoa-whoa, what is it?
Good for you. Uh, quarters or rolls of quarters?
Oh, okay. The what?
What?
Okay, you're on.
Oh! And so the miracle of life begins, and aaiiyyyeeee!
Can I ask you something?
There's my scene, there's my scene. "Mrs. Wallace, I'm Dr. Drake Ramoray, your sister's neurosurgeon. I'm afraid the situation is much worse than we expected. Your sister is suffering from a..."
Ye-ye, we go to yours!
God, I just, I hate her! I hate her!! With her, 'Oh, I'm so talented.' and 'Oh, I'm so pretty,' and 'Ooh, I smell so good.'
No, but I hear lyme disease is open, so...
Look, Pheebs, I just, I wanna apologize for, for saying that your method was stupid and-and maybe ask you to be my teacher again. And-and I promise, I won't touch a guitar until you say I'm ready. You really think I'm ready?
Hey-hey! Stanley! Hey-hey! You're leading man is here! Let's get to work.
See? Eh, wasn't that fun?
Yeah, it is! You wouldn't have lost the ring, right? Y'know what, Ross you were right from the start, he should be your best man.
Hey, is uh the rest of my candy bar around here?
Well, the brown one brings out your eyes, but your butt looks great in the blue one.
Chandler? A word.
Sure! I would love to wait with you guys! Thanks!
Yeah. Hey, I hope Ross didn't think that we just went in there because we were uncomfortable being out here!
Maybe that's the problem.
Not following you.
Yeah. Whew, it's hot with all of this stuff on. I ah, I better not do any, I don't know, lunges.
U-N-I-sexy?
Here's a little tip, she really likes it when you rub her neck in the same spot over and over and over again until it starts to get a little red.
Oh and uh the guy who got the Paris trip is at table four.
All right!
Uhh, well I've got an audition down the street and I spilled sauce all over the front of my shirt. You got an extra one?
What?
Well, we were! But Ross was talking so loud on his phone they threw us out!
Oh, yoii. What was that for?
Yeah, they're not coming.
No-no.
Hey!
It will be when you look like that in a tight skirt! This is great! I'm getting more dates than ever!
Ohh, a hunk of sandwich from last year.
No. What?
I meant female nudity. Alright? I don't need to see Lou Grant frolicking.
Ms. Monroe... Oh there you go.
How'd it go?
No! No! No! No! No! How you doin'?! How you doin'-Damnit Carl! Go wait in the hall!
Monica. Oh... huh, I always thought it would be Rachel.
No.
Oh don't listen to him, he's just some guy who really wants the apartment, but I don't think he's gonna get it.
That's right! I'm taking the essence.
Set another place for Thanksgiving. My entire family thinks I have VD.
Yeah, o-o-o-o-okay anyway, I just wanted to say I'm sorry. Here.
Hmm, noodle soup.
Hey, no matter what happens with Ross and Emily, we still get cake right?
You can pee here!
We didn't ruin it!
I got it.
Monica and Rachel made out.
See ya! All right Pheebs, I am ready for my first lesson.
All right.
Thank you. Cha-ching! Oh, well hello Mr. Lincoln. Better luck next time buddy. And the drinks are on me!
Hey you guys, this is my agent, Estelle.
Good.
Yeah, I-I think that women just have a lower threshold of pain than men, that's all. I mean, come on, it's just a little wax.
Hey!
Listen, while you're on a roll, if you feel like you gotta make like a Western omelet or something... Although actually I'm really not that hungry...
I will be okay! Look Chandler, you gotta get it out of your head that I can't take care of myself. Okay? Look, I'm not gonna miss you helping me out with money. The only thing that I'm gonna miss...is you. And now the dog.
Oh, but when Phoebe has a problem, everyone's all ears!
Hey Gunther, have you uh, have you seen Chandler?
Somehow they got the idea that you only invited them because of me. They...feel a little unwanted.
Okay! Look-look-look, uh, if you're gonna be moving in with him I feel it's my responsibility to tell you the truth about him! Okay? He's a terrible roommate! Terrible! He uh, forgets to umm... Oh-oh he always, he always umm-Oh, who am I kidding! He's the best roommate ever!
Cool!!
Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot you had that whole Rachel thing.
Uhhh, Phoebe and Joey.
Aww that's nice. Family should be there, huh? This is her wedding, happiest day of her life.
No, was my best friend. Anyway, I don't know why you're pushing for him so hard. With him out of the way as my best friend, there's a spot open.
Then, uh, then I'm sorry.
What's the matter Ross?
Right-right up here.
Hi!
Yeah, maybe it's like y'know, that jock thing. Y'know how football players pat each other after touchdowns.
So, did you uh, find anyone to marry you guys yet?
Yeah, I know!!!!
Oh, hey, Monica, we've got a question.
Hey! I'm in, they're gonna let me audition!
She really said that?
Who-ah-ho.
Hey, now you're the one who wet his pants.
'Cause he has a strong suspicion that you dropped the ball on the Lender project.
Oh yeah! For every dollar Shutter Speed makes, one penny of it goes right in Joey's pocket.
All right, what are we havin'?
How could I not get the part? The play was about a 29-year-old Italian actor from Queens.
It's between us and the sea, Ross!
Hey!
Okay! Okay, look! You-you-you got Harrison Ford up there!
So, we're having fun, right?
Oooh.
Why isn't that valet back with my Porsche?
What are you doing?
Not me.
There's my scene, there's my scene. "Mrs. Wallace, I'm Dr. Drake Ramoray, your sister's neurosurgeon.
What's not to like? Custard? Good. Jam? Good. Meat? Gooooood.
Hey, wouldn't be cool if our duck and chick had a little baby? We could call it Chuck.
Wow! Didn't know that.
Bye-bye!
Yeah, it's this great part, this boxer named Nick. And I'm so, so right for it, y'know, he's just like me. Except he's a boxer, and has an evil twin.
Hey, if she were marrying a guy, she'd be like the worst lesbian ever.
Joseph's good, isn't he?
Why God?!! Why?!! We had a deal!! Let the others grow old! Not me!!
Thanks.
Ahh, yes.
Anything I can do? Whatever you need.
Oh, I embarrass you?
Ohhh!
Hey, listen you ah....
What's goin' on?
Yep. Ice Capades.
I'm not sure.
Oooh, what you got there?
I wanted to go to the strip club!
Hit me!
Well, it's not a part, no. I'm teaching acting for soap operas down at the Learning Extension.
I don't want to marry Chandler!
Havin' some trouble?
Name one!
Oh-oh, yeah-yeah, I bet all the sex makes it easier!
Oh, I'm-I'm not working tomorrow.
Come on!
I'm sure it's a famous watering can, okay. But, come on...and what is with the really hot stick in the bathroom?
Oh.
Thursday's clearly not good for ya, pick a day!
I-I did! I told her everything, Chandler! But she wouldn't believe me.
Hey! I am secure with my masculinity.
Hey!
Come on Pheebs! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!
Oh really? Well, maybe you and I go out for drinks? You're the other one right?
The vicar!
Hey, here she comes.
I'll get it.
...I d'know.
Yeah. And uh, I paid for the other half.
Yes!
Yeah, but sandwich time is right now.
Oh, well no problem there.
Uhh, just a minute officer!!
Uh-uh, excuse me, I do have to interrupt on Ross's behalf. I-I think the rule applies here y'know, since she has a chance to get on broad back...
Hey! So I'm back.
I discovered I'm able to count all of my teeth using just my tongue.
So let me get this straight. If you go with Bonnie tonight, you're doing the smart, healthy thing and moving on.
Uh, listen I gotta double check for tickets tonight. Who-who got what?
Ewww! Ugly Naked Guy is using his new hammock. It's like a Play-Doo Fat Factory.
I don't know Ross! I-I tell you what, let's flip to see who does it, okay? You-you call it in the air, all right?
Okay, well my girl from the other night was special. She was a scientist too!
Nope. Man look at this! Ross, I can't believe you said you'd play rugby. I mean look how brutal this is!
Days Of Our Lives. Anyway, you're not gonna believe it! My character is coming out of his coma!!
Lookin' good Mr. Cotter.
So you've just married the one time then?
There's like-there's like 300 bucks in this one!
Hey!
Chandler, is that...
I'll be right back. What was that?
All right well, y'know...I guess we know what we have to do to get down.
Hi-hi, I'm Joey.
Oh, forget about it. She rocks!
Hey, you wanna do Joey a favor, maybe you go out with Joey.
Hey Rach!
She's gone. She had a bag and she left.
So you're really doing this, huh?
Hey listen, why don't you come downstairs with me? There's some really nice girls down there.
Didn't I tell ya? Always showin' off.
Someone you didn't make up!
Great...Great...and thanks for being so understanding. I mean, I didn't want to make a big deal out of this, you know. You could, uh, put the picture of the famous baby in my room. I mean, if you want to.
Done! I did it! Heh, who's stupid now?
My folks.
And you don't a little good about donating the money?
Ok, uh, hey Richard, if you had an extra ticket to the Knicks game and you had to choose between a friend who smells and one who bruises you who would you pick?
Well all right so, it looks like we're even!
Hey, how come, uhh, Chandler didn't come?
Yes, now is when you swoop! You gotta make sure that when Paolo walks out of there, the first guy Rachel sees is you, She's gotta know that you're everything he's not! You're like, like the anti-Paolo!
Are you kidding me? I never rent a movie without it! Oh. Uh, okay uh let me call you back.
Okay. "It's a typical New York City apartment. Two guys are hanging out." Ross
You know what, you guys? It's their first time, why don't we just forget about the money, alright?
What?! What good is that gonna do anybody?
Ah, he can't make it, he said he had to his... Whoa-oh!
Yep! Looks like it's gonna be a leeeeean Christmas at the Dragon house this year.
Hello? Oh, hi. Yeah, hold on a second. Ross, it's Julie, for you.
Ma! What're you doing here?
Are you ok, Ross?
Well uh, I went down there and told him that no one treats my friends like that and that he'd better come up here and apologize. I'll see you later.
Oh yeah. If you ah, move your hamper, you see what color the tile used to be. Yeah.
Y'know what else makes you wonder?
What is it?
Ben! Ben! Ben!
What?! Wait-wait-wait! The handsome man was about to enter!!
Uhhhh.... I'll just pee in the street.
Nothing, I'm just practicing blowing you off because I'm gonna be a big movie star!
Ooh ooh ooh ooh, there's no room for milk!
Yeah, Rach, I think you're handling that really well.
Sure?
Say what?
Hey-hey listen...
Uh, well, kinda yeah. Like, remember last week when Alex was in the accident? Well the line in the script was, 'If we don't get this woman to a hospital, she's going to die.' But I made it, ' If this woman doesn't get to a hospital, she's not gonna live.'
Oh well listen, anyway she's directing the new Al Pacino movie. You gotta get me an audition!
That guy's like a cartoon. What do you see in him anyway?
What you do mean?
Just pull on it.
Wouldn't she?
You can come over and watch the Super Bowl. Every year, all right?
No-no, stay right there. Gettin' closer.
A handsome man enters. Hey! How's it going guys? I don't know what you two were talking about, but I'd like to say thanks to both of you. You, you wouldn't let me give up on myself, and you well you co-created Fireball. The end.
You have any idea what this'll do for your sex life?
It's hard, y'know, his huddle is closer to Dutch girl.
No, yeah, no, ok, but not yet. I don't wanna seem too eager. One Mississippi, two Mississippi, three Mississippi. That seems pretty cool. Hey, Angela.
Good for you!!
I'm sorry, do I know you?
I don't! No, I wanna live with the super-hot Australian dancer.
Oh come on. Nobody likes two different kinds of eggs equally. You like one better than the other and I wanna know which.
Yeah lady! Give us candy!!
Definitely!
Animals dressed as humans.
I'm not talking to you! You broke my fridge!
Yeah.
Yeah-yeah, it's down to me and two other guys.
Miracle!
Whoa, that doesn't necessarily mean that he's breaking up with you.
Hey, no way, that rooster's family!
You see this, this is a friend.
You should both know, that he's a dead man. Oh, Chandler?
Hey!
What about the chick?
A little foos?
I'm Joey. I mean, I'm disgusting. I make low-budget adult films.
Oh well, that changes everything! Y'know what Pheebs?
Okay, look I'm sorry, I went in there to take a nap and I know I shouldn't have, but you got porn!
Y'miss it?
Hey! You're here! Great! Great! Great! Let's get going buddy, we've got a scene to shoot!
And we don't work hard?
Hey everybody! Uh, I'd like you to meet Janine. She's-she's gonna be my new roommate!
Hey. It happened!
I know. It was so cool when I was up there before. Me and Jim Belushi would just be crackin' up about something... Then I get fired off of Days Of Our Lives and he takes me down. Now he's just laughing at me. Look at him, that smug Belushi bastard, I'll...
Thank you.
Isn't there any way you can keep him?
I have to pee. And Rachel's in the bathroom!
Wait a minute.
Let's see what else he'll do!
The Unbearable Likeness of Being!
Yes! Yes, I did.
Okay. Okay. Ace!
Yeah, my agent just called me with an audition for Days of Our Lives!
Can I see the comics?
Exactly.
Hey Chandler! Y'know that girl you went to college with who-who became a movie director?
Oh, a couple of nurses asked them out. Maybe they're with them.
No. No, Kathy.
Yeah, yeah. Hey, why don't you give a pull on that rope?
Yeah.
Yeah but, I can pronounce Jurassic.
Man, I wish Ross was coming with us! Y'know? I'm gonna miss him!
Are you thinking about Monica?
Ahh, you drive safe.
That's not gonna work out! Then she's gonna come home all weepy and you'll be tellin' her, "Oh that's okay. You'll find someone." And then, bamn! She finds you!
Oh, you said it Mike. Aw! There's got to be a better way!
Look, I'm sorry I didn't tell ya. I'm sorry man.
Geez, look how fat she got.
Hey, you know our phone's not working?
Really? Oh uh, oh just give me five more minutes with it.
Oh, hey, how about this one. Ah, it's says so in the script! Y'know ah, I-I don't know why my character likes you either, I mean it says in the script here that you're a bitch.
Why don't you like PBS, Pheebs?
Whoa-whoa dad? There's a dad in the commercial?
Okay, for next time, what do you say?
Hey-hey-hey-hey, I can help you decide who should do it! Yeah, we could have like uh, like an audition and see how you'd handle maid of honor type situations.
Uh, well yeah-yeah, I've got all of that going on. Yeah, listen uh, I want you to make sure you tell Chandler that he couldn't have been more wrong! Uh-oh! I gotta go Monica, my uh, my sushi's here!
That makes sense!
Rach, these are for you.
...look both ways before you cross the street.
Where've you been?
Iced tea.
Yeah.
Rach! Rachel! Okay, the next highest bidder is at table one.
Well, there were a couple of calls last night, but ah, I don't think any of them are gonna work out.
A TV as if it appears from nowhere! That's the dream! Man, how did you afford this stuff?
An annulment? Ross! I don't think surgery's the answer here.
Hey, I don't need violence to enjoy a movie. Just so long as there's a little nudity.
You are dogged man! I totally fit!
Yeah-yeah, yeah, with that-that uh, plumber girl...
Y'know what Ross? I'm not gonna let you get away with this!
Woah, hey, yo.
Fumble!
I'm gonna go down there and teach that guy a lesson.
Look, Rach, Rach! I've been with my share of women. In fact, I've been with like a lot of people's share of women. The point is, I've never felt about anyone the way Ross felt about you.
Okay.
Hey, the ad alone cost 300 bucks!
Phoebe?
Me too, but I guess I do have a couple of more-
Yeah, but what if he doesn't? He's such a good duck.
Where's all the tissues?!
Uhh, excuse me is there a Mr. Bowmont at this table?
Thank you.
Yeah.
Hey.
Oh-ho, you should get inside my head.
Did you see the size of the closets?!
Ok, you know what blows my mind? Women can see breasts any time they want. You just look down and there they are. How you get any work done is beyond me.
Fresh squeezed orange juice, with pulp! Just the way you like it.
Sure, now I'm scared.
I mean, it's not so much an underpant as it is a feat of engineering. I mean, it's amazing how much they can do with so little material! And the way they play with your mind! Is it there? Is it not there?
Thank you!
True story!
You mean how they're friends and nothing more?
Well, no, not exactly! All right, look, I, I wasn't trying to save Ross. Okay? My sandwich was next to Ross. All right? I was, I was trying to save my sandwich.
Of course you do! I saved him! You're mad at me! It all adds up! You want Ross out of the picture.
Ross, you should know that my pants are startin' to come down and I'm not wearing any underwear!
Yeah that dog left!
Huh? So whaddya think? Casa de Joey. Huh? I decorated it myself.
Hey! Hey! Be careful around my Porsche!
It's him, not it!
Hey, hey, hey, you're lucky I caught them when I did, or else who knows what woulda happened.
Oh no! No! No!
Yeah!!!
How was your conference?
What, are you crazy? When a blind man gets his sight back, does he walk around like this?
Okay, but I don't see you asking any other paying customers to put on aprons.
Oh no, not you too!
Seven hundred bucks!
All right. Good deal.
Warm milk and Excedrin P.M.
Pantyhose! Y'know? They way they start at your toe and go all the way up to here... I should go take these off shouldn't I?
Excuse me, Aaron? Hi! Umm, I have a little problem with the schedules. Originally, I wasn't supposed to work today, and I have this wedding that I really have to be at. It's my best friend's, and I'm officiating so I really can't work past four.
Yeah, I like that. But no-no, how does that explain why Rachel found my underwear at your place?
How're you doing?
Wow, is this friendship? I think so. Check it out, we're bracelet buddies.
How'd you get over that teacher?
No! I am not a pervert! Okay? It's just... I just... Kinda...
What?!
Great! Thanks.
Uhh....
Listen, the next time you talk to him, can you ask him which one the strongest Power Ranger is?
You think I need a new walk?
Is he gonna be ok?
So, you just left? Her place was really that bad?
You know what the. . .
Hiya.
You call that delicious?
Okay. Okay, okay, hey. There we go, let's get your feet up there. Good night, Kate. Sweet dreams. I'm gonna put this can right here in case you have to hurl.
Yeah, wow, sorry Rach.
Oh-ho-ho, you think I don't know what breaks my fridge? Excuse me! Well what do you know! Broken! That'll be $400!
Yeah! But if would've know what kind of friend you were gonna turn out to be, I wouldn't have worried about it so much! See you around!
Uh, it's 2:30 in the morning!
Look, I don't hate Janice, she's-she's just a lot to take, you know.
Over the line?! You-you're-you're so far past the line, that you-you can't even see the line! The line is a dot to you!
No, no, no, don't get up, I got a cooler right here.
Here. I need to borrow some moisturizer.
Hey Pheebs! Hey!
Yeah, what's that like?
How you got three women to marry you, I'll never know.
Good morning.
Whoa, jam! I love jam! Hey, how come we never have jam at our place?
Hey, I've done plays before. I'm a serious actor.
Y'know, breadstick fangs are always funny.
All right! I'll try! But if I can't, you can stay with Chandler and I until you get settled.
Ooh! So close.
Oh well-Hey-hey! Maybe, maybe uh, maybe this is a good thing. Y'know? It'll-it'll give you a chance to shake things up, play different characters. You're so talented.
Me too! Me too! Me too!
...Yeah?
This is for my boat, pretty cool huh?
About what?
Hey Pheebs! Listen, this wooden box keeps sliding out from under the seat. What-what is it?
Oh. Maybe. But hey I know how I can find out. We're going to a New Year's Eve party, right? So at midnight, I can kiss her. And if she kisses me back, great! Y'know? But if she says 'Dude, what the hell are you doing?' I can say 'It wasn't me, it was New Years!'
Hey, y'know what you guys? I think I'm gonna go walk her home.
Can I talk to you for a second?!
Yeah I guess you're right.
Well uh, she didn't want to hang out with you guys two nights in a row. I'm so sorry.
He's got the body for it.
And I gotta go sell some Christmas trees.
What happened to the foosball?
Wow! That was good. That was... Tweezers?
Excellent.
Oh yeah!
Y'know, I can see why you think that, but ah, actually, you know who I think it is?
Almost cried huh? Hear that Chandler? Almost cried!
Check it out. How much of a man am I?!
Yeah, it was! All right, listen, I can't...
No it isn't, I ate that.
Where are you going? The vicar won't be home for hours.
Look, I just need a wire something to jimmy it. Oh hey, one of you guys give me the underwire from your bra!
Hey, y'know what? I'll come too. I'm making money now; it's about time I give something back.
No-no, I don't really have any money. Not yet, anyway...
Ohh great!!!
What-what is it, what is it?
Good enough to get fired.
Good-good, okay, sprinkle some of that on your legs, it'll absorb some of the moisture and then you can get your pants back up.
Well, there was that one time that Monica and Rachel got together.
Yeah. Whew, it's hot with all of this stuff on. I ah, I better not do any, I don't know, lunges.
Aww, man. That's the girl I was hiding from. When she finds out he's my roommate, she's gonna tell him what I did.
Guggly worm.
Now? You want me to go over there now?
If the Homo Sapiens, were in fact 'Homo-sapien', is that why there extinct?
No.
Tequila!!
Why would he turn off the TV?
So ah, Phoebe tells us you write jingles.
No I'm not. Why would you say that? That's just mean.
Nice going. You just saved yourself a couple months of sex.
So why don't you give me your number?
What are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing?
Alright alright. You're a monkey. You're loose in the city. Where do you go?
C'mon, sit. Just sit down, sit.
That's great! That would be great! Let's do that!
Ooooooh.
Ah.
Damnit Carl!
Really? To what?
Okay.
Well OK then. Was that the oven timer?
Dude! What are yo-you trying to kill me?!
Erica.
Hey uh, have you guys scene Chandler?
Kate, do you even like me?
But sadly I could not be enticed.
The allergy guy got the part! Thanks!
Man, hell of a two weeks, huh? Y'know what, though? I really feel like I learned something.
Hey, Monica, I got a question. I don't see any tater tots.
Good luck.
Twice?
Oh-oh, hey-hey, Kate! Listen I want you to meet everybody. Everybody, this is Kate.
That uh, that is my roommate Rachel.
Wow Pheebs, you speak Italian?
All right, look, I'm not proud of this, ok? Well, maybe I am a little.
All right! You can have the chair.
Come on look guys, don't fight.
Well, I can't use these forever. I mean, let's face it, they're no friend to the environment.
Look Rach, my parents bought this fridge just after I was born, okay? Now, I have never had a problem with it. Then you show up and it breaks! What does that tell ya'?
Okay. Well, if that's how you feel about it, fine! None of you get to live with me in my great big hand-shaped mansion! Except uh, you Pheebs. You can live in the thumb.
Do you want me to learn?!
Hey, Gunther. Can you uh, can you cover for me? I just got an audition.
Hey guys! I was at the library all morning and I already finished my five pages for today!
Pheebs, you can't do that. The casting director doesn't talk to friends, she only talks to agents.
Come on baby, don't go. Please? What do you say?
No, but he's...
Wow! That was incredible! Beard of bees, here I come!
Hey Monica, why are we watchin' the business channel?
Hey, uh, why don't you read it to her?
Oh, oh, oh, sorry.
Oh, 'cause you can just match the evaluation to the exam with the same handwriting and boom, there's your admirer.
I put it on to scare Chandler!
Maybe I could give thanks for you shuttin' up, eh?
Yeah? I just figured y'know, after living with you it'd be an interesting change of pace to have a female roommate, y'know? Someone I can learn from, someone-someone who's different than me. And what's more different than me; a guy who's not 19 than say a girl who is 19? Enh? Not just a hat rack my friend!
All right! But uh, listen, what do you say we crank it up a notch?
Rach! Hey! It's fine! You're at Joey's!
No-no! No! I mean it's gonna be all smelling like Monica!
Look, it's okay, no, no, no, really, look um, I really appreciate this Pheebs, but I think I'm gonna have to go back to Estelle.
What're you doin' here? Aren't you supposed to be out with Rachel?
What's up with Gene?
So, assistant to the director. That's a really exciting job, I mean, you must have a ton of cool responsibilities.
Okay, time to take off the bra.
You said, you wanna come in for some lemonade?
Well that thing is clearing in the way! All right. Ah-ha! Ah-ah!! Damn fridge!
Great story! But, I uh, I gotta go, I got a date with Andrea--Angela--Andrea... Oh man,
Chandler giving you a hard time huh?
I told you not to move it! Rach, how would you feel if say, I wanted to move you mom, and you said don't, and I did it anyway and her head fell off?
Oh, they gave it to me at the sleep clinic, and it's gonna help me not to snore.
Yeah, yeah, okay. Uh, look buddy, I came with that girl, and I had this plan to kiss her at the new years countdown &#150; I'm trying to win her over, so I was wondering if..
This is it! This is my category.
They sent me today's script! They never send the script!
He's planning your birthday party.
All right, put your 20 bucks down. First one to find the tasty treat wins. Okay?
Well maybe I love ya'.
Okay, see that blind guy right there? I'm gonna bash his head in later.
My whole family's from Naples!
Or ha-ha, we could go over there and pee on them.
Nope.
Oh whoa-whoa wait a minute! I have to do it?!
Okay. See you guys later.
Priesthood! Look Ross, I'm telling you, she has no idea what you're thinking. If you don't ask her out soon you're going to end up stuck in the zone forever.
Nope. Op, wait! There he goes.
Do you uh, do you-ready for a refill?
Yeah, I had to teach Ross my bit because I actually didn't get a callback.
You know more than one Fun Bobby?
Oh there is! If you want something enough and your heart is pure, wondrous things can happen!
And now Chandler! We're all gettin' so old! Why are you doing this to us?!
All right! So that's it! It's over! Everybody knows!
Saw a girl with that vest.
Ah well, the ah, Pennsylvania Dutch, come from Pennsylvania.
Thanks, Rach. Look, you guys are just terrific. Y'know? Now, how about clearing out of here so I can get some new customers. It's all about turnover.
Yeah.
Can you tell me how this happened?
Interesting.
Uh Cecilia Monroe, she plays Jessica Lockhart.
You kissed him?!
I got time.
Joseph Stalin. I think you'd remember that!
Well, he's gonna. I'll see you a little later, ok? Hey, how ya doin'?
Why is 10 the highest?
Hey!
Ugh, I cannot wait to ask her out!
Okay, I guess it doesn't seem that weird.
I know, here-here!!
Yeah, in a poem maybe.
Great. Then you'll be able to spend more quality time with your real friends, the spoons.
Hey!
Na, na I'm ok. Oh and uh, just so you know, I'm not movin' back in 'cause I have to. Well, I mean, I do have to. It's just that that place wasn't really, I mean, this is...
Yeah, you don't want that.
No-no, thank you.
What's twisted?
Awful! Horrible!
'Cause it's always somethin', you know, like Monica's new job, or the whole Ross's birthday hoopla.
Wow, that's in like 20 minutes. You'd better get dressed.
Whadja think?
Sorry.
Yes! Didn't you ever read Sports Illustrated?! No! I didn't read yours! But come on, we can go to the game tonight!
Well, I think we all learned something.
Well, maybe a little. I wish you hadn't seen me throw up.
Alright... I've got to go shower.
Hey!
Yeah! I'm fine! Thanks! Hey Rach, how you doin'?
"Take good care of your Momma son."
Chandler's wearing panties.
Hi, here's the deal. We lost a carseat on a bus today. It's white plastic, with a handle, and it fits onto a stroller. Oh, and there was a baby in it. He wants to talk to you again.
Okay! We'll need a six-pack of Zima.
Uh, hey, Dr. Greene, why don't you come with me, we'll put your jacket on Rachel's bed.
So! Things can go wrong! You don't know! What if he doesn't make it?!
You're smoking again?!
Whoah!
When you're off the phone, do you wanna get a pizza?
Well, that's pretty good. But you might wanna tone it down a little.
All right! Here we go! 1999! The year of Joey!
Where's my underwear?!
Yeah bye-bye! Hey! So just a light layer?
Maybe, I should call this place and get them to put my 'Days of Our Lives' on here. You know, juice this puppy up a little.
All right, I'm gonna go say hi the chick and the duck.
If you wanna get back in the car, we need the wire, your call.
Uhh, that's not them. I'm gonna go call the police.
Vell, Eva, ve've done some excellent vork here, and I vould have to say, your pwoblem is qviiite clear.
Yeah! Yeah! That would be very helpful! Yeah.
They know you know.
Phoebe, that's crazy. When I first met you, you know what I said to Chandler? I said, "Excellent butt, great rack."
All right! Westminster Abbey! Hands down, best Abbey I've ever seen. Hey! Okay. What do you think of the Abbey, Chandler?
Ohh yeah.
So I got your car, it's right outside.
Can we come it yet?! We're dying out here!
Whaddya think? Today's the big day!
C'mon! Just try to picture her not pregnant, that's all.
Look, just because I know about you two, doesn't mean I like looking at it.
Okay.
Well, back to square one.
What about her? They've only been going out for two weeks. Ross has been in love with you for like 10 years.
Look, do you want the ring or not?!
They can't kill me, I'm Francesca's long lost son.
Ah! Huh?
Oh No-no-no-no-no-no-no! He went over to Ross' to bring the dog back here!
That's all right. Hey you guys, you know what's going to be great about the fishing trip this year? When my dad gets me out in the middle of the lake and gives me that, "Joey, what are you doing with your life?" stuff. I can say, "Well, I'm doing a movie with Charlton Heston dad. What are you doing with your life?"
Come on baby, come on!
If I can't have it you can't have it!
Hey.
Nooo. No, no, ah, are you sure it wasn't something that sounded like Ginger, like ah, Gingeer?
Oh, Richard's here. I should run down say bye to him
See you later, Gene.
Oh well then, good night!
So you've been sittin' around here all mornin'?
Hey Estelle, listen...
Oh, it's a new TV show. Yeah. I'm up for the part of Mac Macaveli or "Mac." Yeah, I'm a detective and I solve crimes with the help of my robot partner. He's a, he's a Computerized Humanoid Electronically Enhanced Secret Enforcer or-or "C.H.E.E.S.E."
Not a dad.
Hey-hey, you're startin' to sound like the butcher's wife there in-in chapter seven.
Hey! Now, I've been watching some tapes, how's this? "Jessica Lockhart will never step foot in this place again! Ever!!"
Hey.
Im sayin I see a difference.
Hey!
B-bye Janice. So when ya' dumpin' her.
You couldn't do it?!
Yeah, yeah, and the Indians taught the Pilgrims what it meant to be hot in the new world!
Hey! Are you okay?
Let me see that!
No-no! I used to get paid for all kinds of medical stuff, remember? Let's see uh, well I don't want to donate sperm again. I really prefer doing that at the home office y'know? Ooh-ooh, maybe they want like some of my blood or-or spit or something, huh?
Spock's birth control.
But I made cards!!
In Bizarro World!! You broke the code!
Oh great! Y'know I would've been perfect for this part, but whatever! Y'know, thanks for making a bad decision and ruining your movie! Good day!
What are you talking about? Bitch.
Listen, drama critics they're nothing but, but people who couldn't make it as actors. You know what you should do?
Yeah, I uh weighted like 27 pounds when I was born so...
What a tool!
Oh sure, go with the sissy.
Oh, no no, that's the beauty part, it goes with everything. You put this on, you're good to go. Ohhh man, you are so wearin' that bracelet.
So what's it gonna be?
Hey! Great, you're home! Guess what Phoebe got me for Christmas!
I don't get it. What happened? What about everything you said under the bridge?
Plus, y'know, I think it should be Joe. Y'know, Joey makes me sound like I'm, I dunno, this big. Which I'm not.
Ah, it's career stuff. I don't know if you heard but they killed off my character on the show.
Yeah-yeah. And the craziest thing is that I just ate a whole pizza by myself!
All right, that's it. Y'know I was still gonna let you have her. But now, forget about it. Prepare to feel very bad about yourself.
And-and-and not only that, I'm gettin' a new brain!!
Ohh, great! Oh hey, listen Ross, thanks for being so cool about this.
Okay Rach, that muffin and espresso, $4.50. Ross, double latte, $2.75. Chandler, coffee and a scone, $4.25. And Pheebs, herbal tea, $1.25. So, all together that's $12.75.
You were right before. I mean, friends are so important.
Oh man! Aren't you guys done yet?! I wanna sit in my chair!
And, and just so you know, if you wanted to expand this scene like, like have the cab crash or somethin', I could attend to the victims 'cause I have a background in medical acting.
You're kidding right?
Ohh, I love birds.
What's up?
Well, what am I gonna do Rach?! I don't have that kind of money!
Oh dear God, let me think.
Dark red.
So Pheebs what's this guy like?
You can't make crotchless panties? You take, you take a pair of scissors and you just cut...
No you don't, I just saw you go in there with Monica!
But it's dark out.
Well knock it off, you're supposed to be my friend.
The airport?
How about a scone on the house baby?
Sure.
I need something sweet.
Hey.
I don't want to, I'm scared.
She's still asleep.
Dude-dude-dude!
All right. Don't look at my list, Ross, 'cause there's a lot on there that you don't have.
Let's ride.
What?
We'll just see.
What do you mean?
Uhh do it?
Well, you gotta give him something that he can't say no too. Like uh, Knicks tickets! Invite the guy to a Knicks game, you're guaranteed he'll say yes!
All the way to the airport huh? You know that's over 30 miles, that's gonna cost you about so bucks.
Oh, you have no idea. And-and when we're on stage I get to-to kiss her and-and touch her, but then she goes home with the director, and it's like somebody's ripping out my heart!
Uh... Phoebe? Phoebe?
Such as?
Did you tell the guy you wanted to have sex with his wife and then fall right out of your chair?
No-no-no-no-no! It's a surprise, but it's gonna be tricky thought because she said she was gonna be pretty busy at work for a while.
Everyday use.
What about Game 1 of the Series?
Have you heard about a little something called, Not Making Girls Cry.
Oh-no-no-no, you are! You do this, you give me the great advice, and hey listen, I was thinking about what you said yesterday about focusing on one woman, I'm gonna do that.
Hi everyone.
What's up man?
Yeah?!
Oh wow that's a great idea! And I still have his credit card.
I'm not answering that.
Great! All right, so I'll call you later.
Here you go.
I'll see you at 8:00.
All right.
I'm sorry! But hey, it's over now, right? Because you can tell them that you know they know and I can go back to knowing absolutely nothing!
Hey, woah, hey, woah.
Hey, Ross, Bodington's!
Noo! I can't take any more secrets! I've got your secrets. I've got their secrets. I got secrets of my own y'know!
Great scene yeah?
Yeah! Well, now that you brought it up, our fridge is broken. We have to get a new one. Now, I checked around and your half is $400. Thanks a lot.
Hey Ross, will you pass me that knife?
Yes!
What are you talking about? 'One woman'? That's like saying there's only one flavor of ice cream for you. Lemme tell you something, Ross. There's lots of flavors out there. There's Rocky Road, and Cookie Dough, and Bing! Cherry Vanilla. You could get 'em with Jimmies, or nuts, or whipped cream! This is the best thing that ever happened to you! You got married, you were, like, what, eight? Welcome back to the world! Grab a spoon!
I have an audition, but I'll definitely hook up with you later. Where are you gonna be around noon?
What? Chandler! Tell 'em!
That's right, $2,000.
Hey.
Looks good, uh?
"...Amy! Happy birthday to you!"
Uh, no, she's at dance class.
It's not my first time.
Wow! This looks great!
Just pickle.
What?
YES!!
Oh! Maybe they'll name yours after you! Y'know, they'll call it, The Ross. And then people would be like, "Awww, he's got a Ross."
He should take the sack?
Hey Gunther, let me get a lemonade to go.
Oh... Yeah, you do.
Hi.
Uhh, well, she's...really good in bed.
Ross and Rachel left us a message saying they were getting married! Isn't that why you guys are here?
Why?
Don't you think I asked him that before he got in?!
Like what?
Look, Chandler I don't think us getting our asses kicked is a solution. Okay? Just go and find Monica!
I think I'm gonna cry!
Oh man! Now she's gonna start all over! We're never gonna get to introduce the hot girls to the new world!
Oh man! Aren't you guys done yet?!
You've seen my huge stack of porn right?
The Irish gig guy?!
Hey Pheebs!
Okay.
I say push her down the stairs.
Look, Ross look, I'm on board about this totally honesty thing, I am, just not about stuff that's gonna get you in trouble.
What?
Yeah okay. Even though my tax dollars paid for this car.
Hi, uh, I'll be reading for the role of Mercutio.
Can you believe this? Al Pacino! This guy's the reason I became an actor! "I'm out of order? Pfeeeh. You're out of order! This whole courtroom's out of order!"
Oh no-no-no-no!
Hey Ross. This probably isn't the best time to bring it up, but you have to throw a party for Monica.
Oh anyway, I just wanted to say how wonderful I think you are.
Hey Mon!
Hey!
That's a good call. Right.
What? Me having a job?
Well, this guy came by to look at the unit and-and he said he didn't think big enough to fit a grown man!
So, you're not mad at me for getting fired and everything?
You wanna smell him?
Who cares? You're Rachel! Who's Kip?
Uh, moist, yeah.
Well, you're way sounds a lot better than mine. Yeah. Yeah! It's not that I'm a bad actor...
Hey Rach, you uh, you want some sandwich?
You won't boss me around anymore?
Oh, tell me about it. And she's been on the show forever, it's gonna be really hard to fill her shoes.
Whoah, boy, hockey was a big mistake! There was a whole bunch of stuff we could've done tonight!
Psss, that is whack!
Come on you guys, come on please-please just give her another chance, huh? She'll come around I promise.
Oh my God! That's great! Congratulations! What's the story?!
This is how much we pay for electric?!!!
Yeah! Yeah, why? What's up?
I'm telling you, that monkey is a chick magnet! She's going to take one look at his furry, cute little face and it'll seal the deal.
Yeah, so did I.
He hooked up! He hooked up with someone.
Oh yeah! I got in there myself once. My roommate bet me five bucks that I couldn't, and then he stuck a board through the handles that locked me in. Yeah. It was funny 'til I started feeling like I was in a coffin.
That's great. Listen, wouldn't it be great though if I got to play Ben's dad?
Right. No big deal.
Chandler!
The ring is gone!
No. No, I'm Joey Tribbiani; we did a scene together yesterday. I-I'm the guy in the coma!
Well, I eat a lot of meat right?
Exactly! All right, everybody, listen up. The coffeehouse is going to be closed for about an hour.
What?
Dude you said, "No!"
Alan.
What a phony.
Oh! Hey right! Not a problem. I totally understand. You need to y'know make sure I don't have any horrible scars or tattoos. Don't you worry; I have nothing to hide. So there you go, that's me. One hundred percent natural! I tell ya, that has never happened before.
No! No, I quit a long time ago. Did I forget to you that one? I'm sorry.
Say hello to the new champ of Chandler's dumb states game.
Hey, how much cash do you got in your pocket right now?
Yeah!
Yeah. Listen uh, I'd prefer it if you didn't call me Joey. Since I don't know anyone here, I thought it'd be cool to try out a cool work nickname.
Hey! Dude, some guy just called for you.
Aww, man, he took the five of spades!! Oh, no-no-no, here it is!
Hey.
Two days ago.
What's this?
Yeah! Help me get this mini-fridge past the security guard.
Imagine a protective porn bubble if you will, okay?
Hey man, you feeling any better?
No way! 'Kay look, if I have to go to the doctor for anything it's gonna be for this thing sticking out of my stomach!
They're ribbed for your pleasure.
People, people, people.
Hey, you know about that?!
Yeah!!
This is where I keep the pizza. And-Hey! Where did the napkin go?!
Hey-hey!
What?
Hey.
Hey Ross, wouldn't it be great if we could go two straight hours without dropping it?!
Yeah, we set up a court in your room. Uh, you didn't really like that grey lamp, did you?
Dawson?!
Oh, y'know what? Since I'm here, I think I'm gonna have me a little beer on the port side.
Check it out, he's winning! Pete's winning!
Yeah! Because this commercial belongs to me and Mitch!
Wow. Thanks. So, uh, what happened?
What-what are you guys doing here? I thought I told you not to come.
And she's back in the game.
Bijan for men? Bijan for men? Bijan for... Hey, Annabelle, Uh, listen, I was wondering if maybe after work you and I could go maybe grab a cup of coffee.
Hey Monica!
Is it back in the cage?
I'm tellin' ya that girl totally winked at me.
Yeah!
Why would you need to say hi to them, you've been feeding them for four days?
I suddenly had the feeling that I was falling. But I'm not.
Ugh! I don't know what I'm going to do! I called the company that sent and th-they don't care! Then I called 9-1-1 and they laughed at me, if this isn't an emergency, then what is?
Hey!
And Chandler I can't believe I let you pay for this one. Thanks man.
All right, we'll start with...apples.
Uhhhh.
Kiss her! Kiss her!
You want to see her again, right?
Right this is staging.
All right! Now you go get that beautiful pig! Oink!
Eggs. Who's eggs do you like better, his or mine, huh?
I'm 30!
The fruit roll up.
What-what's so funny?
You do?
Well, that was only 'cause I used the red one to unclog the drain.
Hey!
Look, I told ya, I'm not going to any clinic! I don't have a problem, you're the one with the problem! You should go to a "Quit being a baby and leave me alone" clinic!
London baby!
I didn't do that! Who would've done that?!
Oh yeah. These are my old work pants, Sergio Valente's.
I don't know. What are you wearing?
Ahh-oy! That was the underwear I was wearing that night in London. Right Monica?
Hey-hey!
Hey!
Hey, hey, look at that talent.
Ma, I don't mean to be disrespectful, but... what the hell are you talking about?! I mean, what about you?
So, Ross and Rachel got married, Monica and Chandler almost got married, do you think you and I should hook up?
I want to go on a ride along!
Ahh, alright, alright, alright, I was young and I just wanted a job, OK. But at the last minute I couldn't go through with it so they let me be the guy who comes in to fix the copier but can't 'cause there's people havin' sex on it.
It's like, you got so many lines to learn so fast, that sometimes you need a minute to remember your next one. So while you're thinkin' of it, you take this big pause where you look all intense, you know, like this.
G'night.
Morning. I just uh, came by to pick up my mail. Where's the mail?
Heads.
No. Nope, I uh...I th-I thought it might be kind of a cool character thing. Y'know? He's uh, he's a face toucher.
Really?! Well, when?
That, is not a cat! {I have to agree with Joey on this one.}
See after the scene, Mr. Beatty comes up to me and says 'good actor, bad kisser'. Can you believe that, me not a good kisser, that's like, like Mother Theresa, not a good mother.
He's doin' some thinkin'!
Morning!
Just casually slip it in, y'know lay the groundwork. Tell her uh, I'm a loner-No! An outlaw! Tell her she doesn't want to get mixed up with the likes of me.
I want this part so much! Y'know? If I don't get this part I'm never gonna eat Macaroni and Cheese again!-No, I didn't say that! That's a lie.
Done.
Vomiting stories are funny...
You got screwed.
Thanks! I've been working out. Hey listen, is it obvious that I'm wearing six sweaters?
Yeah!
Hey!
I can't believe it, Ross. This sucks!
Uhh, rub it?
Who's your friend? He's hot!
What?
Ow!
Oh, well think of it like this, when you're 90...
Feminist issue. That's where I went!
Hey, how much did you guys tip the super this year?
What are you gonna do? You're gonna fire me?
I don't know who made you the boss? All right? We invented this game!
Whoa-whoa! No-no-no-no-no, nothing is going up! Okay? Up, up is not an option-what's a urethra? Are you crazy?!
Then she came back with "The question is, when are you gonna grow up and realise I have a bomb?"
You have Knicks tickets?
Hey Ma. Listen, I made the appointment with Dr. Bazida, and... Excuse me? Did you know this isn't Ma?
Uh-huh.
She told us.
You got porn!
Well, you're amazing.
How about 'cause if you don't, his mother might.
Come on man there's gotta be something that gets you choked up! Like uh, uh oh, what if you saw a three-legged puppy?
Uh no, not really. It's an independent film y'know? So we don't have a real big budget. I figured I'd just stay in your room.
Thanks for stopping by. See ya! I-I am so sorry. I...
Won't-won't that take longer?
Yeah, me too.
I got this pair marked excess, I gotta tell ya, there was no room for excess anything in there.
Yeah-eah! 200 dollar reward, split five ways!!
Hey, Rach, how you doing with The Shining?
Oh yeah...
Well, okay. You were my girlfriend and we were doing the crossword puzzle. Y'know like you guys were doing last night. So, that's it. I'm in love with Monica and I'll be moving out.
Thank you.
Hey, look, I don't need you getting all judgemental and condescending and pedantic.
Awwww!
Awww! Mel Torme died.
Ross! Can I talk to you for a second?
I love babies, with their little baby shoes, and their little baby toes, and their little baby hands...
Phoebe, could you do me a favour? Could you try this on? I just wanna make sure it fits.
Whoa-whoa, that-that was just a theory! There's a lot of theories that didn't pan out. The lone gunman. Communism. Geometry.
All right well, I'll take you someplace nice then. Look! A guy tipped me a hundred bucks today.
No! No! No! For my new fridge-our new fridge!
I don't need to think about it. I was Dr. Drake Remoray. That was huge. Big things are gonna happen, you'll see. Ross, you still there?
Hey, there's me! April 17th. Excessive noise. Italian guy comes homes with a date. Hey Chandler, look, you're in here too.
You got it. Okay. Now, I can pass for 19 right?!
Hey man, what's up?
Okay, it's a typical New York City apartment. Two girls are just hanging out.
Hey! Chef Geller! Y'know that little speech you made the other day? Well I got a problem with it!
Yeah. And speaking of volcanoes, man are they a violent igneous rock formation.
No. No.
What? No-no it's her birthday!
Pheebs, I am so sorry! I know I promised you a fun road trip with your friend and I didn't deliver. But-but-but now I know that you think being awake is an important part of friendship! So, so, so I will strive to-to stay awake for as long as I know you.
Well, you know that guy that's on my show that's in a coma? He's havin' a brunch.
And for Ross, Mr. Sweet-tooth.
Oh, no no no. Its for Ursula. I just figured, you know, size-wise.
You practice losing the Grammies too?
Yeah right.
Ok, um, uh, we three feel like, that uh, sometimes you guys don't get that uh, we don't have as much money as you.
Uh, listen Phoebs, I know you're not goin' in there but do you think it'd be alright if I went in and used his bathroom? Oh, that's fine, never mind. Cool, snow, kinda like a blank canvas.
I gotta do what I gotta do, you gotta do what you gotta do, you just do it.
Okay, fine, so now what, I just pull it off?
Hey!
That's uh, scenes from next week's show. Next week's!
The country?
It's two gifts in one. It's a pen that's also a clock! Huh?
Y'know Terry, I-I don't really need to do this. I got my own cable TV series, with a robot.
Not likely. 'Cause you see that body bag right there
Hey, where are you going?
Out.
Alright, look, I'll start, OK?
Well, thank you. So, can we play 20 Questions now? I've got a really good one! I've been thinking about it since Kansas.
They loved me!
Hey-hey.
Don't do it!
It-it doesn't?
OK.
What's the matter with you?!
You don't know how long we're gonna be in here! We may have to repopulate the Earth.
I gotta tell you. You're the best in the business.
I'm coming up!
Well nothing yet, they really hate you and I want to fit in.
Hello.
I'm saying maybe you and I crank it up a notch.
What award are you practicing for?
Hey, I'm back!
You don't think this is going to be a big break for me?
But it hurt's my Joey's Apple.
Because, I'm not wearing any underwear now.
Home is Home Star stew.
Oh-ho, yeah!
No-no-no, I'm serious. You don't smell it? Something's on fire.
Pheebs!
Thanks for coming Mrs. Greene. Well, ok, you take care.
4:30.
Then you're not invited.
Oh man, pizza? I like pizza. Put olives on the pizza.
You're right. Maybe I shouldn't even go on the call back.
Congratulations.
Okay, get ready to owe me!
Okay. Did ah, you guys mean you plus one?
Thanks! Let's keep going.
What if we have to pee?
What's he doin' in my section?
Ooh, sorry. Sorry. You finish, go.
Hey, Kate!
I doubt it. Mostly regional work.
They actually said that?
Oh, yeah, yeah, sure. We live in the building by the uh sidewalk.
OK, we'll just leave, and when we pass her on the stairs, she won't know it's me 'cause we've never met.
How you doin'? Joey Tribbiani, America.
Because I think this character is going to be suspicious about stuff.
You play hard to get.
Is everything okay?
So I guess you all saw it.
Yeah, at Macy's. You were the Obsession girl, right? I was the Aramis guy. Aramis? Aramis?
Did you not hear the plot of the movie? "She's been dead for ten years." I'm gonna be a millionaire!
Yes that's the one about the soldiers who fight in World War I!
Hey.
Kinda.
I don't know, Chandler is supposed to be passin' 'em around...
Or maybe, it's because you're hanging around here at 11:30 on a Wednesday.
Oh wow! You can tell this soon.
Hey, it's not the first time I lost a girl to a cowboy spraying cologne. Bijan for men? Bijan for men?!
Oh yeah, lava spewing, hot ash, of course some are dormant.
Umm...
Nice try. See the Netherlands is this make believe place where Peter Pan and Tinker Bell come from.
Eh, what are you gonna do?
Oh come-look, when I was a kid my dad's company gave season tickets to the number one salesman every year, all right? My dad never won! Of course, he wasn't in the sales division, but still, I never ever, ever forgot that!
Listen, uh, I don't know when I'm gonna see you again.
Wha? Wha..aa? Let me get the father. Hey, we need a father over here! We need a father!
No! No, I'm the minister! All right, look-look, put 'em both on the phone, I'll marry them right now.
All right, let's go Pheebs.
No-no-no! We gotta go! Come on! Here we go.
Way to be strong, man!
Pathetic mess? I know, butcome on, man, she's needy, she's vulnerable. I'm thinkin', cha-ching! Thanks. Look, you have not been out with a woman since Janice. You're doin' this.
No, smile! Not that face, smile! Everybody smile!
All right, well first of all I would like to say that you both performed very well. Okay? You should be proud of yourselves. And-and I would also like to say that in this competition there are no losers. Well, except for Rachel-Damnit!
You got to go on a ride along?!
Okay, what else?
All righty, what do you say we head back to my place?
Oh, ha-ha-ha! Ooh! Wait a minute, I used to get medical experiments down on me all the time!
Yeah. Yep. Yeah. All right, well uh, I'd better go.
Yeah.
This is the unit for you my friend. Sturdy construction, tons of storage compartments, some big enough to fit a grown man.
Yeah.
See, there was kind of a mix up in my agent's office, but I'm still on TV and that's good exposure.
Oh, uh, ok. Right this way. All the other pregnant women seem to be goin' in here.
If you want some privacy you can use my hole.
Yeah.
Hey, it's me! I'm comin' in!
This sucks man! The last night you're here and I lose the two most important things in my life, the foosball table and $500.
I know! Yeah, but, look I can handle it. All right? Look, I can listen to the radio, huh? And Ross gave me this great book .
Well look, I'm breaking up with Katie so I had to put on some extra padding. Y'know? I mean, if she hits me when she's happy, can you imagine how hard she's gonna hit me when I tell her I'm taking away the Joey love?
Look, I'm telling you if I put my hand on my stomach right here it doesn't hurt that bad.
Why not?
Hey. Man, it is so hard to shop for girls.
Hey, I didn't stalk her. I mean
Well, I'm doing this telethon thing on TV and my agent got me a job as co-host!
All right, I should get going, big day a work. Y'know I'm in a coma? Today, they do this test on me and it turns out I'm not brain dead.
Yes!
Hey, Pheebs!
Man, I got this close to him and Monica kneed me in the back. What's going on?
Over the line?! You-you're-you're so far past the line, that you-you can't even see the line! The line is a dot to you!
Man, this is a long drive! Are my eyes open? No!
Now you're thinking you gotta sleep with him.
Uh, hi. We uh, we used to work together.
Dude, I'm telling ya! I'm fine!
Tongue?
Oh, so you're playing Adrienne, huh?
Come on man! Listen so uh, are you gonna squeeze the perps shoes a little bit before he lawyers up?
I know it doesn't make much sense...
Hey, what if I said, I could even things out for ya, meatwise.
Gotcha.
Hey, it's not like it sounds.
This is your place?
It is me! It's a musical version of Tale of Two Cities. So I think I'm gonna sing New York, New York, and ah, oh I left My Heart in San Francisco.
No-no-no! Look, I've been thinking about it. I'm an actor right? So I won't get nervous talking in front of people.
Whoa, wait, Pheebs, wait a second! Don't you wanna stay here and talk about it?
What the hell does a paleontologist need a beeper for?
But hey, Ross, this place is available now!
Yeah you got 5 years left!
No! I want an award I did win! But nobody's giving me any of those! Plus-Hey Rach, if-if I put it up there right? When people come over they'll see it and they'll think I won it.
Well, let me ask you something, was Kip a better roommate than me?
Oh my God! How many of these things did you have? These are pure vodka.
I don't want to talk about it. Y'know, you could've at least saved me a whole cookie.
Alright, come on you guys, it's not that big a deal. Really... I mean, I just go down there every other day and... make my contribution to the project. Hey, hey, but at the end of two weeks, I get seven hundred dollars.
So where you gettin' it?
A date?! No, no Pheebs you-you must be mistaken, because I know you wouldn't schedule a date on the same night you have plans with a friend!
Girls say it to me all the time! And believe me, if she's anything like me, she's just gonna be relieved.
Well maybe I got a little upset and maybe I told them where they could go.
Hey Monica!
Joey Tribbiani.
No no, seriously, Chandler and I were just talkin about this. He is so much cooler than our dads. I mean, you know, our dad's are ok, ya know, but Richard is just- ow, ow. What are you kickin me for? Huh? I'm tryin to talk here.
Question. Was ah, 'Egg the Gellers!' the war cry of your neighbourhood?
Actually I rent the whole place and, I just got what you meant. Thank you.
Those two only had each other!
You're right, I'm sorry. You're right.
Everybody's doing stuff!
Huh.
