Y'know, so I don't read as many important books as you do, and I don't write trick poems that seem to be about one thing but are actually about something else. And y'know what, I get excited about stupid stuff, like when I my People magazine comes on Saturday, and the new Hold Everything catalog. Y'know but that does not mean that I'm empty, I care about things. I care about my friends and family. You have no right to make that kind of judgment about me.
Absolutely! Now get out of here you!! Okay, I'm running out of places I can touch him! Look, is there something wrong with me? I mean why am I only attracted to guys where there's no future? Either they're too old, or they're too young, and then there's Pete who's-who's crazy about me, and who's absolutely perfect for me, and there's like zip going on! I mean, seriously, does it sound like something's wrong with me?!
No, look, she's obviously unstable, okay? I mean she's thinking about running out on her wedding day. Okay, fine! But I mean, look at the position she's putting him in! What's he gonna do? Ross is gonna run over there on the wedding day and break up the marriage?! I mean, who would do that?! Okay, fine, all right, but that's y'know, it's different! Although it did involve a lot of the same people.
Hello? Yeah, hi! Mrs. Tribbiani? Hi, this is Monica Geller. Yeah I'm just calling to say that Chandler and I uh, really hope you can make it to the wedding. Yeah, apparently a bunch of invitations that we sent weren't delivered. Umm, I guess there was some screw up at the damn post office! T-Tell me about it! Yeah, yeah, the US Post Office? No, more like US lost office! What are they Irish?!
It is so weird, I know what I said, but uh, this morning, I was lying in bed I was, I was imagining what it would be like to say yes. I know it's a little sudden, and it's a little rushed, and it's totally not like me to do something like this, but that doesn't mean I can't. Right? I mean I'm-I'm crazy about Pete, and I know that we want the same things, and when I thought about saying yes, it made me really happy.
Emily has probably been planning it since she was five! Ever since the first time she took a pillowcase and hung it off the back of her head. That's what we did! We dreamed about the perfect wedding, and the perfect place, with the perfect four-tiered wedding cake , with the little people on top. Thanks. But the most important part is that we had the perfect guy who understood just how important all that other stuff was.
I really like to say that I'm-um... Y'know what I'd really like to say? I'm drunk!! That's right mom and dad your little Harmonica is hammered!! And guess what! I've been drunk before! And I've smoked a cigarette! And I got a box of Ding-Dongs hidden in my underwear drawer! It's all okay. It's okay because I turned thirty today. And, and I can do anything I want! Because I am a grown up.
I know. Let's try a look...of far off...wonderment. Okay, we'll-we'll gaze into our future and we'll think about our marriage and the days to come. Chandler! What is the matter with your face?! I mean this picture is supposed to say "Geller and Bing to be married," not "Local woman saves drowning moron!" Hey! Don't laugh at him! He's my drowning moron!
Okay, I was thinking we should have a beautiful guest room, right? With a mahogany sleigh bed and bedside tables with flowers on them all the time! And we could have a roll top desk with comment cards on them so people could say how much they loved staying here!! Okay, whatever, I really haven't thought about it that much.
Michelle, I only beeped in so I could hear my message. I mean that's allowed. Yeah-huh! I mean look, yeah, you know what I would really appreciate it if you didn't tell your Dad about. What do you mean, you're not comfortable with this? Come on we're friends!! That bitch always hated me. I'm calling her back.
This switch thing has been driving me crazy. So I turned it off and checked every outlet. Now, four of them don't work. Which means, one of them has to be controlled by the switch. So, I plugged in things in all four of the outlets that-that make noise, so that way, when I turn it on I just follow the noise and find out which one it is.
See? That's what I mean. I mean that, that's great! But I wouldn't trade in what I have for that. I mean I'm gonna be with Chandler for the rest of my life, and that's what makes me happy. Hey sweetie, come here! Come sit down. Hey Phoebe and I were just talking about how our relationship is deep and meaningful. It really is don't you think?
Chandler, for so long I...I wondered if I would ever find my prince, my soul mate. Then three years ago, at another wedding I turned to a friend for comfort. And in stead, I found everything that I'd ever been looking for my whole life. And now...here we are...with our future before us...and I only want to spend it with you, my prince, my soul mate, my friend. Unless you don't want to. You go!
I swear, I promise. I promise. Oh my God, I'm so excited! {And I just can't hide it! I'm about to lose control and I think I like it! Sorry, just couldn't resist it.} All right, listen let me tell you, do not get her flowers. Okay? Because y'know, she cries when they die, and there's the whole funeral...
Oh, isn't he? Oh, you know, I really think this time it may work with him. I mean, he just makes me feel so good and I've been feeling so lousy this last couple of months, no job, no boyfriend. Well, at least my cup is half full.
Look, I know that you're in a place right now where you really need to hate Julie's guts, but she didn't do anything wrong. I mean, she was just a girl who met a guy, and now they go out. I really think that if you gave her a chance, you'd like her. Would you just give that a chance, for me?
Oh. Well, I didn't realize that you needed it back right away. I mean, you told me to go and be a caterer. So I went. I beed. I mean, I... I used it to buy all this stuff. But look-I've got another job tomorrow, so I'll pay you back with the money I make from that.
Hi, uh, Richard it's Monica, um, listen I did something kind of crazy tonight, um, maybe I'm getting my period or something, I don't know. Um, anyway, I, I, I beeped into your machine and I heard a message that, that freaked me out, and um, you know what Michelle will tell you the rest. I, I, um, I'm sorry, okay, I, I hope that we can forget the whole thing. Okay, bye.
Now, Mom, everything's going fine, really. Yeah, Ross is great. He's uh, he's in a whole other place. No, he's gone. No no, you don't have to fly back, really. What do you mean this might be your only chance? Would you stop? I'm only 26, I'm not even thinking about babies yet.
Oh, gosh, this is so weird. I mean, his whole life was in this apartment, and now it's gone. You know, I think it would be nice if we just took a few moments, for Mr. Heckles. I mean, he was kind of a pain, he was, but, he was a person. You're all going to hell.
All right, listen up. There is usually only one dress in each size so when they open those doors, fan out. Now, this is what you're looking for! Memorize it! When you locate the dress, blow on these. All right? Three short blasts, when you hear it. Come running.
All right, look, Ross. I realize that you have issues with Carol and Susan, and I feel for you, I do. But if you don't help me cook, I'm gonna take a bunch of those little hot dogs, and I'm gonna create a new appetizer called "pigs in Ross". All right, ball the melon.
Something went wrong with Underdog, and they couldn't get his head to inflate. So anyway, um, his head is like flopping down Broadway, right, and I'm just thinking... how inappropriate this is. Um, I've got something in my eye, uh, Joey, could we check it in the light, please?
Why? Because everything is my responsibility? Isn't it enough that I'm making Thanksgiving dinner for everyone? You know, everyone wants a different kind of potatoes, so I'm making different kinds of potatoes. Does anybody care what kind of potatoes I want? Nooooo, no, no! Just as long as Phoebe gets her peas and onions, and Mario gets his tots, and it's my first Thanksgiving, and it's all burned, and, and I... I...
Ohh, wow! That's great! Oh wow! We really have to start planning! I have, I have a lot of really specific ideas! We should probably get together like four times per week. You can come over to my place; we'll get together before work! What do you say, 6:30, my place? I'm so excited!
Y'know, let's face it, I'm not a kid anymore! I-I need to be with someone who-who wants the same things that I do! I mean coming to my place of work and telling me that you love me, I want that! Talking about pig sex over lunch, I don't want that!
All right, that's a little sketch of the cake, umm some sample menus, umm y'know what I thought we would start out with Tuscan style finger food, and for music, here's an alphabetized list of all my CDs! I've highlighted the ones that would go really good with the food.
Okay, while we're waiting for these pills to kick in, I'm gonna sit you down on the couch. Come on. Get some nice soft pillows under your head, I'm gonna turn the TV on and you can watch whatever you want. And I'm-Sit down--gonna make you some tea. And then, I'm gonna rub your feet.
Ok people, I want you to take a piece of paper, here you go, and write down your most embarassing memory. Oh, and I do ask that when you're not using the markers, you put the caps back on them because they will dry out.
Okay, all right don't judge me to much. Okay? Um, but I saw this info-mercial, and um, I swear to you I have never-ever bought anything on TV before, except for this mop. But there was this stuff on leg waxing, it just, it looked so amazing....
Oh God, stop with the plan! So what, so what you saw him with a girl? Who cares?! That doesn't mean anything! Now look, you're going to go out on a date with Danny and you're going to be so charming he's gonna forget all about that stupid subway girl.
See, I've been waiting my whole life to be engaged, and unlike some people I'm only planning on doing this once. So, uh y'know, maybe this is selfish and I'm sorry about it, but I was kinda hoping tonight could just be about that.
I also, did a little something in fur. But umm, that's really just for me. Okay. So, why don't you go into your room and try these on and we'll see-get a better idea of what's gonna work.
No! Listen, I'm not gonna go through this with you again, okay. Just once I wanna beat when you can't blame it on the broken nose, the buzzer, or the fact that you thought you were getting mono. Let's just call this, tie score and it's halftime.
It's this dumb thing that Ross made up `cause he was trying to fool our parents. It's a way of giving the finger, without actually having to give it. I remember I cried the night you made it up, `cause it was the first time that I realized that I was actually cooler than my older brother.
'Cause I was going by it the other day and I saw that there was a stock with my initials, MEG, on it and, well, sometimes I have to watch for two or three hours before it comes up again but when it does, it's pretty exciting.
Ohhh, I knew you loved her! Then you need to go to the airport and tell her. You're probably just gonna catch her just as she's about to go to the gate. You're gonna call out her name and say, "I love you!" And she's gonna say, "I love you, too!" And you guys are going to have the most amazing kiss, everyone at the gate will applaud.
So anyway, I'm cooking dinner for him Monday night. You know, kind of like an audition. And Phoebe, he really wants you to be here, which will be great for me because then you can 'ooh' and 'ahh' and make yummy noises.
Y'know what really bothers me? Is-it's how-how different you act around them! I mean y'know the throwing the tennis games, the fake laugh, the "I'll see you around, Bing!" "Not if I see you first, Doug!" I gotta tell you, I don't like Work Chandler. Okay? The guy's a suck-up.
If it bothers you that much, just go out and get the shoes. No. Don't do this. This is stupid! I don't have to prove anything, I'm gonna go get them...But then everyone will know. Unless I get them, and then wake up really early and put them back! ...I need help!
This place is really my Grandmother's. I got it from her when she moved to Florida, otherwise I could never afford a place like this. So if the landlord ever asks, I'm 87 year old woman, who's afraid of her VCR. So are you thirsty?
I mean, all I'm asking for is just a little emotion! Is that too much to ask after six years?! I mean what? Are-are-are Rachel and I not as close as you guys?! I mean do we not have as much fun?! Don't I deserve a few tears?!! I mean we-we told Joey, he cried his eyes out!
Right. Umm, listen since we're-we-re on that subject, umm, I just wanted to tell you that uh, well, I-I was going through a really hard time in London, what with my brother getting married and that guy thinking I was Ross's mother...
Right. Umm, listen since we're-we-re on that subject, umm, I just wanted to tell you that uh, well, I-I was going through a really hard time in London, what with my brother getting married and that guy thinking I was Ross's mother...
I mean this has been like my dream since I got my first Easy Bake Oven and opened Easy Monica's Bakery. I mean I would kill for this job. I mean I can totally do this job, and God knows I paid my dues. But Pete's just doing this because he has a crush on me.
So Rach! You're the first guest at Hotel Monica! Umm, you'll just have to tell me how you like your eggs in the morning. And I thought I would bring them to you, y'know, in bed. Oh, you have been through so much.
Back then, I thought that I would never, ever get the chance to go out with a Chip Matthews, and now he's-he's called me up and asked me out. And the fat girl inside of me really wants to go. I-I owe her this. I never let her eat.
Okay, I've broken them down into categories. Okay, we have uh, we got holidays, birthdays, candids, y'know... And then what I've done is I've cross-referenced them by subject. Right? So if you're looking up, oh let's say birthdays and dogs, you get Photo 152. See?
Okay, all right, how's this? 27. Italian-American guy. He's an actor, born in Queens. Wow, big family, seven sisters, and he's the only....boy. Oh my God, under personal comments 'New York Knicks, rule!'
No-no, it's not okay! It's not! I mean you were just... You're so incredible! You went through all this time and effort to make this tape for me! Y'know I'm just gonna-I, I am gonna make this up to you! I will! I-I am going to cook anything you want in here , and I am going to do anything you want in there!
Of course not. I mean gosh, Chandler what you did, it's, it's a wonderful thing and I really appreciate it. I know I have this weird thing where I want everything to be in the perfect place, but I'd never expect you to worry about that.
It bit. It was a 50's theme restraunt. I have to cook in a costume and dance on the counter. I mean I was a chef at Cafe des Artistes. I mean how could I take a job where I have to make something called Laverne and Curly Fries?
Leon, Leon. Shhh! Guys. Wait, I don't understand. Those steaks were just a gift from the meat vendor. That was not a kick back. I'll just replace them and we can forget the whole thing. What corporate policy? No. Yeah. All right. I just got fired.
I'm getting married!!!! I'm gonna be a bride!!!! No, I will not shut up because I'm engaged! Ohh, big talk! Huh, why don't you come over here and say that to me?! Huh, buddy?! Yeah, my fiancee will kick your ass! Come on, apartment 20! Apartment 20!
Yeah, y'know, but something like salmon which would be so much more elegant than the chicken. And, you wouldn't have to worry about the salmonella. But of course with salmon you'd have to worry about the chickenella... So, I can't wait to see this place you're getting married!
It is not over because she is going to call you and tell you she loves you. And the reason why she couldn't, is because her feelings were so strong, it scared her. Now you go home and wait for her call, she could be calling you from the plane! Come on now go! Go!
So what, you're not the only one. I mean, half the time we don't know where we're going. You've just gotta figure at some point it's all gonna come together, and it's just gonna be... un-floopy.
Okay, I umm, I ran into Richard yesterday and he asked me if I wanted to go for a bite and I did. The only reason I didn't tell you is because I knew you'd get mad and I didn't want to spoil our anniversary.
No, a guy would be saying, "I'm never gonna get to sleep with anyone else." Oh my God! I'm never gonna get to sleep with anyone else! I've been so busy planning the wedding that I forgot about all the things that I'd be giving up! I mean, I...I'm never gonna have a first kiss again.
Hey. Oh good-good you're here! All right, I figured it out. I'm gonna take two tables of eight, I'm gonna add your parents, and I'm gonna turn them into three tables of six. Okay? And I called the caterer; I added two extra meals, we are good to go!
Yeah, you were, but you decided to make salmon because you had some left over at the restaurant. And then you realised if you bitched about it, then you would stop cooking, and you would have to make your famous baked potato and Diet Coke.
And-and-and if I die, from a long illness. And you're writing out my eulogy and you open a desk drawer and you find a note from me that says, "I will always be with you," and you still can't shed one tiny tear, I know you'll be crying a river inside.
Yeah, well you call her and tell her that y'know when we were kids her precious little Frannie tried to undress me several times, okay? And if I hadn't have stopped her, there probably wouldn't even be a wedding to go too.
Oh, he just doesn't want us to go through any trouble. Think of how excited he'll be when we go out and surprise him! Plus we get to have our own, ani-Vegas-ary! A-Nevadaversary!
Um, okay. You just called a little while ago about needing a signature on the admissions form. Well, it turns out we need a whole new one because uh, you see, I-I, I put the wrong name again. 'cause um...
Look, not that I enjoy talking about people who I went to high school with, 'cause I do, but umm, maybe we could talk about something else? Like you, I don't even know where you work?
I mean they're trying to do everything they can to make me quit, and if there were any other job, I would. But this is something I've been waiting for my whole life.
Your boyfriend has been in there for over an hour. I can't believe it, it's like I'm living with him again. He's here when I go to sleep, he's here when I wake up, he's here when I want to use the shower, ughh. It's like I'm sixteen all over again .
Honey, umm I-I love you, but umm, if you call our wedding a party one more time, you may not get invited. Okay? Listen, we could always earn more money, okay? But uh, we're only gonna get married once.
No! No, she doesn't. Uh Phoebe, what she makes-that's uh-they're sock rabbits. They are completely different-Okay! Okay! Okay! I didn't make it! I'm sorry! I totally forgot about tonight and the fact that we're supposed to make the presents!
Listen you guys, I don't mean to be a pain about this but, um, I've noticed that some of you are just placing them on. You wanna push the caps until you hear them click. Gunther, where're you going?
You are both idiots. The joke is not funny, and it's offensive to women, and doctors, and monkeys! You shouldn't be arguing over who gets credit, you should be arguing over who gets blamed for inflicting this horrible joke upon the world! Now let it go! The joke sucks!
Okay! Wait-wait-wait! Shhh! Okay, umm, I just wanna say that...I love you guys so-so much and-and thank you for being here on my special night. Our special night. I mean it just wouldn't be my-our-our night, if you all weren't here to celebrate with me-us-Damnit!
Don't stare. Now she just finished throwing his clothes off the balcony, now there's just a lot of gesturing and arm-waving, , Ok, that is either, "How could you?" or, "Enormous breasts!" Here he comes!
You're gonna find a place. But even if - God forbid - you didn't.. So you postpone the wedding. Is that really so bad? I mean, think about it. You could take all the time you needed to get everything that you want. You could have tulips, you could have salmon.... Mmmmm... Salmon!!
Hey, umm, so listen umm, my friends were telling me a little about this ah, ultimate fighting thing and it, well it sounds really dangerous. I-I don't want you to get hurt, 'cause I kinda like you.
Ya know what, I think I'm gonna go to my room and read Cosmo, maybe there's something helpful in there. Know what, at least maybe I can learn how to do an at home bikini wax with leftover Cristmas candles.
It's not like, I haven't any opportunities. I mean, y'know, I'm just waiting for the perfect guy. I'm seeing this guy Roger, all right? He's not perfect, but umm, I think maybe I should just get it over with. Y'know, give him my flower.
I can't believe that this whole time we thought he hated us. I mean, isn't it amazing how much you can touch someone's life, without even knowing it?...Would you look at this dump? He hated us. This is his final revenge!
Why not?! I mean this has been the most amazing week. Would it be so terrible? Even if we were friends who lived together. Or, maybe someday friends who stood up in front of their other friends, and vowed to be friends forever.
Oh my God, it was the best funeral ever! I mean, everyone loved the food, and guess what? I even got another funeral for tomorrow-the dead-guy-from-today's best friend. I mean, it is like I am the official caterer for that accident!
No, it is me! Y'know, I'm not just the person who needs to fluff the pillows and pay the bills as soon as they come in! Y'know, when I'm with her, I am so much more than that. I'm- I'm Monana!
Alright, you see these little flower blossoms? They should be facing up, not down, because, well, the head of the bed is where the sun would be. You don't love me any more do you.
No, I can't afford this either. No. I-I-I'm, I'm just to figure out which one I want then I'm gonna get it at Kleinman's, this discount place in Brooklyn, day after tomorrow they are having a huge sale.
It was soo amazing, he is so sexy, and smart, which makes him even sexier. Oh gosh, I gotta so you this. Last night, we were fooling around and he stops to write a poem.
We have to do this. We are playing for women everywhere. Okay, just think about every lousy date that you ever had, okay, every guy who kept on the TV while you're making out...
My stock, MEG, it went up 2 points. Hey guys, do you realize that if I had invested my $127 in myself yesterday that I'd like have...a lot more than that today. Ya know what, I'm gonna do it.
I know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish, but, were you planning on bringing up the whole baby/lesbian thing? Because I think it might take some of the heat off me.
Okay, fine but please don't be upset! Okay? I was really depressed okay? And really drunk! I just wanted something stupid and meaningless. I just wanted...just sex. So, when I...went to your room that night...I was actually looking...for Joey.
All right, that I'll retract. But I stand by my review, I know food and that wasn't it. You're marinara sauce tasted like tomato juice! You should serve it with vodka and a piece of celery.
So, how'd the lasagne go over? Really?! Good. So you owe me three pretty things. Yeah, I've been thinking a lot about you too. I know. It's hard this whole platonic thing. It's a word!
Fortunately, it is me. And, they made me head of purchasing, thank you very much. Anyway, I just ran into Ross and Chandler downstairs, and they think we should go out and celebrate. You know, someplace nice.
Boy, I love carrots! Oh! Sometimes I like to put them between my fingers like this and-and hold them down here while I talk to you. Umm, and-and-and y'know if I get really hot umm, I-I like to pick up this knife and-and umm, I-I put the cold steal against umm, my body.
Y'know what, I've got to walk out of here right now, 'cause getting over you is the hardest thing that I have ever had to do. I don't think I could do it again.
'Dear Dr. Remore, know that I love you and would do anything to have you.' Gosh. 'Your not-so-secretive admirer, Erica Ford.' Ooh wait, 'PS enclosed please find 14 of my eyelashes.'
Okay, guys, listen, don't forget that tomorrow is the day that Emily gets married again, so whatever we do, just try to really keep Ross's mind off of it.
And when I told her that I was gonna be moving in with Chandler, she was really supportive. You were so great. You made it so easy. And now you have to leave. And I have to live with a boy!!
What? Wait! Why? Chandler! Chandler! Wait! I'm sorry, I was just playing for one second! I was trying to find you to tell you that, look if you don't want me to see Richard again, I won't! He means nothing to me!
No! But because he thought I was to faaaaa.... And every time I think about it, it makes me feel as bad as I did in fifth grade! Y'know, I-I really think that you should apologize to Julie.
Oh, stop beating yourself up! People make mistakes! These things happen! There aren't any message you've forgotten to give me are there? Apparently you're not very good at it! I...
Hey, Joey, I don't think that you should leave Chandler alone. I mean it's only been two days since he broke up with Kathy. Maybe you can go fishing next week?
All right, I'll take one box of the mint treasures, just one, and that's it. I-I started gaining weight after I joined the Brown Birds. Remember, how Dad bought all my boxes and I ate them all?
Ugh, she's upstairs not doing the dishes! And I tell ya something! I'm not doing them this time! I don't care if those dishes sit in the sink until they're all covered with-I'll do them when I get home!
Y'know what? You're right, I'm sorry. Actually you were a big help tonight. Yeah, and thanks for putting my grandmother in the cab and making sure she got to the hotel safely.
Well, I've tried everything. I give up. I guess I'm not gonna be the mom who makes the world's best chocolate cookies. I do make the best duck confit with broccoli rabe. Kids love that right.
She's living my life, and she's doing it better than me! Look at this, look. She buys tickets for plays that I wanna see. She, she buys clothes from stores that I'm intimidated by the sales people. She spent three hundred dollars on art supplies.
What?! Ross y'know this isn't even about you! I mean this is about Rachel and something wonderful happening for her. I mean you know even if you're right, what if he wants to sleep with her, does it mean he gets too?
I just ran into Dave and he told me that you blew him off! I mean, you listen to me! Now, I'm calling the shots! I say you leave Ross alone and go get Dave! What the hell were you trying to do?
Look, when it started I was just trying to be nice to her because she was my brother's girlfriend. And then, one thing led to another and, before I knew it, we were...shopping.
Okay, y'know what, I'm not fine, I'm not. I mean how can I be fine, hearing you come in with her, she wants to see your bedroom.... Y'know what, what if we're friends who don't see other people?
Uh, Michelle. Yeah, that was me, I-I dialed your number by mistake. Oh, you're so sweet. Yeah, we were a great couple. I know I really miss him. Well, you know how it is, it's that....
Anyway um, when he left he forgot to take the poem with him. Now, I am like totally dense about poetry, but I think it's pretty good all right. Check it out.
I know that switch does something, okay? So-so I went down to city hall and got these. All I had to do was pay $25 and wait in line for three hours.
Guys, hurry up! The flight leaves in four hours! It could take time to get a taxi! There could be traffic! The plane could leave early! When we get to London, there could be a line at customs! Come on!!
Fine! Judge all you want to but, married a lesbian, left a man at the altar, fell in love with a gay ice dancer, threw a girl's wooden leg in a fire, livin' in a box!!
So I did tell you. Okay, y'know, that really isn't the thing. Umm, the thing is that, right now I'm just in a place in my life where I need to focus on me. Y'know what I mean?
Well umm, I was thinking that maybe we could come up with a system where we trade of being maid of honor for each other. Like hypothetically, if Phoebe were mine...
Yeah. The great thing about the jam plan was, I was taking control of my life. So I asked myself, what is the most important thing to me in the world and that's when I came up with the baby plan.
Look, I'm not happy about this either, but y'know if-if Ross says he's happy then we're just gonna have to keep our feelings about Emily to ourselves. Are you cool with that?
All right, Rachel, I know-I know you think I'm crazy, please, before you tell him you love him, just-just try to find one person who thinks this is a good idea. Because I bet you, you can't.
All right guys stop it. Rachel, we're very sorry that is a very insensitive thing for us to do. And y'know what? Let us make it up to you, we have two really great guys for you.
A positive atmosphere! But I-I-I have had it up to here. From now on, it is gonna be my way, or the highway! All right? Does anybody have a problem with that?!! Hey new guy! I said, does anybody have a problem with that?!
Really? I'm really tired of being your relationship tutor. You're gonna have to figure this one for yourself. All right? Y'know what? If you're too afraid to be in a real relationship, then don't be in one.
Great! It's so amazing! I mean, last time Dr. Roger came over, I was so nervous, but then after being with you I'm all like, "Can the doctor see me now?"
We have too! I mean what if Ross's hears that and then calls her back and then they get back together? Is that what you want? Ross back with that controlling, neurotic, crazy Emily? The Emily that wouldn't let him see you?
Well, instead of being sad that tonight is my last night together with Rachel we thought we'd go out to dinner and celebrate the fact that Rachel is moving in with Phoebe.
Nooo! Never! I mean, we're living in the moment. God, it is so nice for once to not have to get all hung up on 'Where is this going?'
See, this is why I told you never get involved with your assistant! And here is no such thing as keeping secrets when it comes to affairs. Did you hear that Chandler? No such thing!
I'm going into business people. I'm sick and tired of being depressed about Richard. I needed a plan, a plan to get over my man. What's the opposite of man? Jam. Oh Joey don't! It's way to hot.
I think we are getting a little ahead of selves here. Okay. Okay. I am just going to get up, go to work and not think about him all day. Or else I'm just gonna get up and go to work.
Umm, actually I was about to tell you that I was, I was going to get out of it, but hey, if we're just goofing around then uh, maybe I will go out with him.
Oh, why does this bother me so much? I mean I don't wanna be one of those people who tells their boyfriend they wanna spend 24 hours a day with them.
Okay. Could the waiters gather around to hear tonight's specials? Okay, first there is a Chilean Sea Bass prepared with a Mango relish on a bag-Why is nobody writing these down?
Yeah! And if, and if we have a baby one-day, and the doctor hands it to you in the delivery room and you don't cry, so what! And-and-and, and if we take him to college and come home and see his empty room for the first time, and you got nothing, it won't matter to me.
Oh my God, me too! Oh! Oh, we'd be like friends-in-law! Y'know what the best part is? The best part is that you already know everything about him! I mean, it's like starting on the fifteenth date!
As a joke, this customer at work who has a crush on me gave me a $20,000 tip. His number is on the check, he just did so I'd call him.
Let's see. Congress is debating a new deficit reduction bill... the mayor wants to raise subway fares again... the high today was forty-five... and- oh, teams played sports.
I mean, why should I let them meet him? I mean, I bring a guy home, and within five minutes they're all over him. I mean, they're like- coyotes, picking off the weak members of the herd.
Well,fall out of it. You know, you shouldn't even be here, it's a school night. Oh god, oh god. I'm like those women that you see with shiny guys named Chad. I'm Joan Collins.
Oh umm, that's because I just wanted to y'know walk in on me and Chandler while we were, y'know, doing it all night. Will you excuse me for just a second?
All right that's it, I give up! Whatever you want you can have it! You wanna sing a song? You wanna do a dance? You want your mom stand at the Alter and scream racial slurs? I don't care!
You say 'Thank you very much,' and then you buy me something pretty. Come on, we're gonna put are hands in this bowl, and we're gonna start squishing the tomatoes.
I-I'm not gonna be able to make it into work today, I don't feel very good. Yes!! Wow! Uh, for a second there I thought I was really better, but I'm not.
Uh, so, uh, Rach, uh... do you wanna save this wrapping paper, I mean, it's only a little bit torn... so are you gonna go for it with Ross or should I just throw it out?
And y'know what, I just realised, in the last year I've only gone out with two guys, Richard and Julio. You gotta help me out here, you gotta set me up, you gotta get me back in the game.
Man, this sucks! Y'know if Mom and Dad don't see us on TV after we made them so jealous, I mean, who's gonna be the losers then?
Just, I love you so much. Just...It's just sometimes it bothers me that I'm never gonna have that feeling. Y'know when you meet someone for the first time and it's new and exciting? Y'know that rush?
Yeah, I mean yeah, I look great. Yeah, I feel great and yeah, my heart is not in trouble anymore! Blah, blah, blah! Y'know I still don't feel like I got him back, y'know? I just want to humiliate him. I wanna, I want him to be like naked and then I'm going to point at him and laugh!
You know, Rachel, when you ran out of your wedding, I was there for you. I put a roof over your head, and if that means nothing to you... twenty dollars an hour.
Nothing, I'm just trying to recreate some of the fun that we had at my place the other day. Remember, when you picked Rachel over me? That was funny.
Yeah-yeah, y'know what? Yeah, that's it-that's it, everything will be mine! Nothing will be yours! That's-that's what I said! Oh come on, Chandler! I'm talking about the barca lounger! It just, it doesn't match! Where is it gonna go?!
Listen umm, I've been thinking, it's not fair for me to ask you to spend all of your money on our wedding. I mean, you work, you work really hard for that.
You guys are always hanging out in my apartment! Come on, I'll only use my left hand, huh? Come on, wussies! All right, ok, I gotta go. I'm going, and I'm gone.
Okay, I gotta go find Rachel but umm, if you guys see her could you please try to give her some really bad news so that mine doesn't seem so bad?
Chandler, you're not fourteen anymore. Okay? Maybe it's time that you let that stuff go. If your father's not at your wedding...you're gonna regret it for the rest of your life.
Well, Rachel wants to take swing dance lessons. Which I think is a really stupid idea! It's dangerous, she's never gonna get what she wants, and who knows who she might end up hurting.
Please, don't listen to Joey, okay. Would you look at him? He-he's obviously depressed. He's away from his family; he's spending Thanksgiving with strangers. What he needs right now is for you to be his friend.
I mean I have not been picked on this much since kindergarten and they had to bring in someone from junior high to do the see-saw with me.
It's worse. The only thing that's getting me through is knowing that I'm gonna be seeing you soon. I think I may even try to get out of here early.
Yeah, yeah, it's interesting.. but y'know what? Just for fun, let's see what it looked like in the old spot. Alright, just to compare. Let's see. Well, it looks good there too. Let's just leave it there for a while.
I'm with you Chandler! I mean I can't have sex with a sick person either, that's disgusting! But I'm not sick! Let me prove it to you. We are two healthy people in the pribe of libe.
It was so wild. We told them we were the Gunnersens in room six fifteen. Only to find out the Boston Celtics had taken over the entire sixth floor!
"Hi, it's Monica. I'm just checking in 'cause I got this message from you and I didn't know if it was old or new or what. So, I'm just checkin'. So let me know, or don't, whatever. I'm breezy."
Okay, the reason why I asked you guys out to brunch today is because I have been doing some thinking about who should be my maid of honor.
Now, in some of these recipes, the quantities may seem just a little unusual, uh, like these coconut mockolate holiday nut bars. I've indicated four cups of coconut, and four cups of crushed nut, and only, uh, one tablespoon of mockolate.
Who? I mean have you seen a car come by here in the last hour and a half? I think we should call Ross, maybe he can get a car and come pick us up.
You went to one where you were popular, and you got to ride off Chip's motorcycle, and wear his letterman jacket. I went to one where I wore a band uniform they had to have specially made.
Y'know, all these years, I thought you were on my side. But maybe what you were doing was sucking up to Mom and Dad so they'd keep liking you better!
It took me 28 years to find one man that I wanna spend my life with, if I have to wait another 28 years then, I'll be 56 before I can have a baby, and that's just stupid.
We'll try to be more careful okay? It's just that, we don't want everyone to know because this is going really well, and maybe the reason it's going really well is because it's a secret.
Oh, this terrible! Everything is destroyed! Look at this. It obviously meant enough for me to save it, and I don't even know what it is! Ohh, it's still soft. What do you think this is?
No, if he doesn't like our cookies, too bad, I am not gonna be blackmailed. Look if worse comes to worse, it gets a little warm, we'll call it a theme party.
No, honey, in a wonderful way. You know what you want now. Most guys don't even have a clue. You are ready to take risks, you are ready to be vulnerable, and intimate with someone.
That's because I-I was just grabbing some things out of the dryer, and it's static cling. Or maybe it's just that God knew I'd be running into you and saw an opportunity.
I know! It's just that...ever since high school Rachel was the one person I told everything too. Y'know? I miss that so much now. She's my best friend.
I've been doing a lot of thinking. A lot! And umm, well, I came up with a whole bunch of businesses you can do with your van. Okay umm, you could be flower delivery person.
But I'm gonna be there... for the rest of my life. I mean, I can't break up with him. I'm the one who made him quit drinking. He's dull because of me.
It's not just the drum noise. Every five minutes, Joey throws his sticks in the air, and I have to hear, "Oh my eye! Oh god, my eye!" I mean, it is so annoying.
Maybe because you used to be aloof, or that you're really sarcastic, or that, y'know, you joke around all the time. Or that you take off your clothes and throw them on the couch.
Oh no sweetie, no! This is my fault, I wasn't clear! I'm really sorry. And listen, you take as much time as you need to move out okay? There's absolutely no rush.
You bet your ass I'm gonna fire you! Get out of my kitchen! Get out!! All right! Anybody else got a problem? How 'bout you Chuckles? You think this is funny now?
Hey. It's three in the morning. They don't know that I've come home yet. You notice how neither one of them are wondering where I am.
Yeah, I think we're ready for our first course. OK, um, these are rot-shrimp ravioli, and celantro pondou sauce... ... with just a touch of mints... and... ... ginger.
They want me to do it, which is really cool, seeing as I've never catered before, and I really need the money, and this isn't a problem for you, is it?
Look Ross, the only question you need to ask is, "Do you see a future?" I mean like do you see yourself marrying her? Oh my God! You did it already! You married her, didn't you?!
That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong. Y'see, he's the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born.
No, they gave us glasses with lipstick on them! I mean, if they didn't change the glasses, who knows what else they didn't change. Come on sweetie, I just want this weekend to be perfect, I mean we can change rooms, can't we?
Nooo! Okay. Whoa! Okay. See I was, I was a little nervous about turning thirty. So the bus boys took me out for some drinks. I wanna puke on you later!
That is a wonder. So tell me something, Mom. If you had to do it all over again, I mean, if she was here right now, would you tell her?
I know! And four ninety-nine for a pillow top queen set, who cares about the divorce, those babies will sell themselves. And I'm appalled for you by the way.
Phoebe, it's okay. You don't have to tip toe around me. I-I've been thinking about it and umm, y'know what? I'm okay about not having that new relationship feeling...
Lips moving, still talking. I mean it may not be ideal, but I'm so ready. No, I-I-I see the way Ben looks at you. It makes me ache, you know?
If you have the big apartment you have to deal with people coming over all the time. That fridge has got to be stocked, okay, that's your department now.
So wait, Ross's stuff is fine, but I have no memories because you wanted to keep the bottom two inches of your car away from water!!!
The woman from the museum called and said that there was a cancellation and that we could move up our wedding and Chandler heard! I know! How bad is this?!
What don't you just calm down Phoebe! All right?! Why don't you just get all your facts before you run around telling everybody that you're the only hot couple!!
So great! He showed me where the restaurant's going to be. It's this, it's this cute little place on 10th Street. Not too big, not too small. Just right.
Well, if you're gonna be totally rational about this, I can't argue with you! All right? Fine, if you wanna tell him, tell him. I just don't want to be a part of it.
No, thank you! You have given me so much! I mean, if it wasn't for you, I would never have gotten to sing Memories on the stage at the Wintergarden Theater!
Lewis Posin! He was my best friend in fifth grade, and-and then one day I asked him to be my boyfriend and he said no. Do you know why?
Or, it could mean that-that you saw Chandler and me together and we y'know were being close and stuff and then you just want to have that with someone too.
Come here! Come here! Sweetie you don't have to worry. No, besides y'know what? I'm gonna have a lot of new things with you. The first time we buy a house. Our first kid. Our first grandkid...
Okay Ben, why don't you come open some more presents, and Santa, the Armadillo, and I have a little talk in the kitchen? There's a sentence, I never thought I'd say.
That was that girl Megan! She booked the Swing Kings on the day of our wedding and said that I couldn't have them back unless I gave her the dress!
I know, he's too charming, but if you two start going out, then it's just gonna make it so much harder for me to hate him.
No-no, wait! Just let me finish, okay? This isn't something that we just, we just impulsively decided in-in Vegas, this is something we both really want. And it is going to happen.
I can't wait to be with you! I'll sneak over as soon as Ross picks up Ben. I'll just tell Rachel I'm gonna be doing laundry for a couple of hours.
Hello? Oh, hi Wendy! Yeah, eight o'clock. What did we say? Ten dollars an hour?... OK, great. All right, I'll see you then. Bye.
You don't know everything. Did you know that I'm going out with Rachel tonight instead of you? Hmm? And did you know that the only baby around here is you?! And did you know that I can't even look at you right now?!
It's so good, that I feel really selfish about being the only one who's eating it, that I think we should have everyone taste how good it is. Especially Ross.
Me? What are you talking about? Nobody could steal me from you. I mean, just because I'm friends with her doesn't make me any less friends with you. I mean, you're my...We're, we're...Oh, I love you.
For this weekend! Oh gosh, it would be perfect, we get to see Joey plus we get to start our anniversary celebration on the plane. We can call it out plane-aversary.
Yeah, well I don't think it really counts if you have to read them off the back of your hand after you fall asleep on the couch.
I'm a good person. And I'm a good chef, and I don't deserve to have marinara sauce all over me! Y'know what, if you want me to quit this bad, then all you have to do is...
Hey, have you guys eaten, because uh, Richard and I just finished and we've got leftovers... Chicken and potatoes... What am I wearing?...Actually, nothing but rubber gloves.
Do you wanna live outside?! Because it's gettin' cold! She gets tons of catalogs and umm, she'll fold down the pages of the things she thinks that I'd like.
OK, look. That is Aunt Iris. This woman has been playing poker since she was five. You gotta listen to every word she says. Hi!
Okay, the owner of Allesandro's came over to yell at me, but instead I made him some sauce, and he offered me the job as head chef!!
Oh my God. Phoebe. Don't look now, but behind us is a guy who has the potential to break our hearts and plunge us into a pit of depression.
Oh, please, stop! Look, we're supposed to be honest with each other. I-I just wish you could tell me-just say, "I don't like your massages."
Exactly. Oh, I love that I can be totally neurotic around you now. Tell me the truth. Don't you like it better now that everything on your desk is perpendicular?
Well, we're trying to find someone to perform our wedding and they're all either boring or annoying or y'know, can't stop staring at the ladies.
You know what, maybe I don't need to have children. You know maybe I just think I do because that is what society, and by that I mean my mom, has always convinced me that I... I do, I have to have children, I'm sorry, I just do.
Look honey, I wanted you to hook up with Ross as much as you did. But he's with her now and you're just gonna have to get over it.
Hi. Uh, my friend here was taking down our Christmas lights, and and she fell off the balcony and may have broken her foot or or ankle or something.
I thought I was making headway, everyone was smiling at me all day, I get off work and I find out that they wrote this on my chef's hat.
Well, I don't care! That-that turkey has to feed 20 people at my parent's house and they're not gonna eat it off your head!
Honey! Do you know that none of that stuff came from me?! I mean I never said I wanted to have babies and get married right now!
Okay listen, y'know when you move in Rachel's room is gonna be empty, you wanna talk about what we want to do with it?
Wait a minute, why don't you just call Mark. I mean, who says you have to sit here and wait for him, you've got to make stuff happen.
That's Great. You know we don't need to talk about this now. Really, I mean this is, is so way, way, way, in the future, I'm talkin' hovercrafts and apes taking over the planet.
Then you two can, can sneak into the cockpit, and things will start to heat up, and then a stewardess comes in... I've been watching too much porn.
Um, yeah, so uh, uhh, listen, I'm sorry I didn't tell you this before but umm, I, I'm no longer at my job, I, I had to leave it.
But I need it. Otherwords I'm gonna have to take that horrible diner job. You know, with the dancing and the costumes. I don't wanna have to wear flame retardant boobs.
Uh, look, Larry honey, umm, I wrote the book on Section 5 and I know that you don't have to wear your hat unless you're in the kitchen.
You sat back and let him have her, you didn't fight at all. Am I right? Do you want the same thing to happen with Emily?
Aunt Syl, stop yelling! All I'm saying is that if you had told me vegetarian lasagna, I would have made vegetarian lasagna. Well, the meat's only every third layer, maybe you could scrape.
I just can't believe you're in here. I mean, what am I gonna do without you? Who's gonna crash the embassy parties with me? Who's gonna take me to the Big Apple Circus?
You would not believe my day! I had to work two shifts, and then to top it off, I lost one of my fake boobs, in a grill fire.
Why? It's just that I've waited seven years for an opportunity like this, and you can't even wait four and a half minutes for a stupid onion tartlet?
If you would stop thinking about Ross for one minute you would notice that there are great guys everywhere! I mean, look! Look, Gunther! I mean, he's nice, he's cute.
Chandler... In all my life... I never thought I would be so lucky. As to...fall in love with my best...my best... There's a reason why girls don't do this!
Chandler... In all my life... I never thought I would be so lucky. As to...fall in love with my best...my best... There's a reason why girls don't do this!
I don't know, I've never had to use the other one. I'm just saying y'know, if we're having sex, he's not gonna be talking.
So, I read this article in the paper the other day that says you're not supposed to throw rice at weddings, because when pigeons eat rice it kills them.
Be that as it may, d'you think you could just help us out here on that monkey thing? Y'know, just for old times' sake? Go Bobcats?
All right uh, the important thing is to take your time, you want to hit 'em all, and you mix 'em up. You gotta keep them on their toes.
And, and, and they wear those little water wings, you know. And they're, they're running around on the deck. Then Hoyt wraps this big towel around all three of them.
Y'know what? Y'know when I said that I want you to deal with this relationship stuff all on your own? Well, you're not ready for that.
Yeah! I mean it was really funny, I-I just don't think you got it. You see Kara's coffee is-is-is weak tasting, okay? But-but what Doug was-was imply that it was weak physically. You get it now honey?
Any time you want. Y'know, when I was younger, all I wanted to do was to play with this dollhouse, but no!! It was to be looked at, but never played with.
I am so glad you guys got together, Chandler and I are always looking for a couple to go out with and now we have one!
Anyway, we're really excited about our wedding plans, and well I guess pretty soon we'll be making a big withdrawal from the Monica wedding fund. What?
Well now, I get to spend my shower with the only people I really love! I mean, I get all those presents without having to talk to people I don't even like!
This isn't easy for me either. I wish things were different, I... If you were a few years older, or if I was a few years younger, or if we lived in biblical times, I would really...
Could you please tell me what this is in reference to? Yes, hold on. Um, they say there's been some unusual activity on your account.
Okay, maybe this will make your teeth look less white. Nope. Okay, colors that don't work are blue, yellow, green, red, black, white, orange, and purple.
Oh, well... um, that's all there are of these. But in about eight and a half minutes, we'll be serving some delicious onion tartlets.
Paolo, I really hate you for what you did to Rachel, but I still have five of these, so heat it at 375 until the cheese bubbles.
And, well, don't you have a lot of wild oats to sew? Or is that what you're doing with me? Oh my God, am I an oat?
Pants and a sweater? Why, mom? Who am I gonna meet in a blackout? Power company guys? Eligible looters? Could we talk about this later? OK.
Yeah. But a part of me also can't wait 'til it's over. Chandler and I have this pact not to have sex again until the wedding.
Yeah. In fact, I like her so much you tell her I want my cookies early this year! Y'know, a box of Thin Mints and some Tag-a-Longs.
It's weird, but you know what I don't wanna throw this away. I mean this is like all I have left of him, gross, drain hair. Ooh!
Okay. Oh but Joey, come over later because I'm going to teach you to make a bird feeder out of just a pine cone and some peanut butter.
All right, all right. Maybe I can fit them in if I just do some rearranging. But uh, Rachel may actually have to sit at the bar!
You may be okay about getting hurt, but I am not okay with being the one who hurts you. That's why I can't take this job.
Oh please! Dad turned my room into a gym 20 minutes after I moved out! I gotta say, a tanning bed and a stack of Victoria's Secret catalogues, not a gym!
Ohh! Umm, Phoebe, I kinda need to talk to you about that. Umm, well I-I-I think it might be time for me to take a step back from catering.
Oh, about five minutes. Right now they're interviewing his opponent. Apparently he trains by going to Iran and pulling the arms off thieves.
Oh, my mom called, they're gonna run our engagement announcement in the local paper, so we're looking for a good picture of us.
Well, um, look I-I don't want this to come our wrong, but ah, you seem awfully confident for a guy I just told I wasn't attracted too.
That's good, have a seat. Um, the doctor says it's gotta be a needle. You're just gonna have to be brave, ok? Can you do that for me?
How do you think I am?! You've wrecked all my childhood memories. You love Ross more than me. And I just rubbed a dead mouse on my face!
I can't believe this, just like 2 weeks ago I was watching Sudden Death, now I'm on a date with Jean-Claude Van Damme. Can you beat up that guy? Can you beat up that guy?
No no, the father can, but um, since I am the roommate I can tell you that she's not here and I'll pass along the message, ok. So bye-bye.
We're not gonna have sex! Okay, nothing's changed here. He still doesn't want children and I still do, so that's why we're just gonna be friends.
Umm, I just wanna say, uh that with a pinch of exictement, a dash of hard work, a dollup of cooperation, we can have the recipe... Are you gonna kill me?
OK, wait, wait, wait, wait. You know what? Ross, let's - let's switch places. You get in the middle. No un-, ya know, unless this looks like we're trying to cover something up.
No! No-no they're not. They're still very angry! But y'know Chandler is also half-Swedish. You know what the Swedish people are famous for? Sitting down and being quiet.
Well then, y'know what? I care about you to much to watch you hurt yourself like this. So if you have to do this, then you're gonna have to do it without me.
Oh look, the pool table's free. Rack 'em up. I'll be back in just a minute. Get ready for me to whip your butt.
Huh. So you're saying like umm, if there was an award for the best bad massage, well who would get that?
You're the most wonderful man. And if you hadn't of said 'if I have to' like seventeen times, then I'd be saying 'okay, let's do it.'
All right, Chandler can make boxes, Ross can wrap, and Joey can lift things. Now Phoebe, go tell the guys they have to help out!
Terrible. If-if I want something done right, I have to do it myself. Other people just wreck stuff. I really think I might kill someone tonight.
I think this is so cool because none of our friends are here and we can be a real couple. We don't have to hide.
Yeah hey, a weird thing happened today whey I was at brunch. This woman overheard that I was marrying you and-and then she...she wished me good luck.
All right. The super couldn't figure out what it did. A $200 an hour electrician couldn't figure out what it did. I've had seven pretty serious shocks. I officially give up.
You can't say that!! You-you don't know!! I mean I thought I was gonna pass out from the pain! Anyway I-I tried, but I-I couldn't...bend that way. So...
I think it's totally insane, I mean, they work for the hospital. It's like returning to the scene of the crime. You know, I say we blow off the dates.
Well, I'm never gonna listen to you again, that's for sure! "Y'know, harm can it do if you go and put your name down?"
Y'know I used to go out with this guy that was a really light sleeper, and whenever I started to snore, he would just roll me over...
What if it's new? I mean, we agreed not to talk again, unless we had something really important to say. Shouldn't I call him back?
All right, I've got a whole bunch of uh-uh, stuff in this area, but umm, I'm getting the feeling that you don't want to deliver.
All right then, then nothing changes! Everything is great! Everything stays the same! And you go unpack because it's been three days and it's driving me insane!
That's because their nerves are probably deadened from being so stupid. But hey, y'know if you don't believe me, please, by my guest.
Why did I 'woo-hoo'? I mean, what was I hoping would happen? That-that he'd turn round and say 'I love that sound, I must have you now'?
My God, I can't believe this! I mean I knew that mom and dad were invited, but I thought that was it! I mean from the ages 7 to 9 Frannie and I were inseparable!
Yeah, and y'know, if you could not mention to them that we live together, that would be great! , I was thinking we would eat around four.
Oh my God. Okay, go into the bathroom, use whatever you want, just don't ever tell me what you did in there.
Okay, forget the specials for a minute. Umm, all right here's the thing, for the last two weeks I have umm, tried really hard to create a positive atmosphere...
Is there any chance that you can look at this as flattering? I mean, she's doing it because she wants to be more like you.
All right Rach, for what it's worth, I think that you're doing great. I mean y'know let's face it, no one handles this well.
Aww, the only reason you want to go out with me because my blond wig, and the big boobs, and the fact that I serve you food.
Okay, Phoebe, y'know what? That-that's it, that's it, all right? No dinosaurs, no ghosts, no giant dogs, okay? They're not the right size, they're not Victorian, and they just don't go.
The second that Ross walks in that door, I want you take him back to your bedroom and do whatever it is that you do that makes him go, rweee!!
Oh no no, this is not for him, this is for me. That way he's still sober but I find his stories about shoelaces much more amusing.
That's a good question. Look umm, last night we let the dice decide. Maybe we should leave it up to fate again. I love you!
Ohh, she's looking down the hall. Oh! She looked right at me! Oh wait, you can't see people through that little hole, can you? Hello!
Sure. Oh, um, Chandler? Y'know, the-the old Monica would-would remind you to scrub that Teflon pan with a plastic brush...But I'm not gonna do that.
Look Rach, we have to move. I mean if they had lost, we would've made them get rid of the birds. Right?
Okay! The movers will be here in 11 hours. Rachel has not packed. Now, everybody has to help! Chandler, we're gonna start with...
So, I'll get candles and my mom's lace tablecloth, and since it's Rachel's birthday, I mean, we want it to be special, I thought I'd poach a salmon.
Well, we just happen to go to alot of places where you might drink. I mean, how do you go to a wine tasting without having a drink? Or... or to a club, or to the... zoo.
Okay, we've been out here for two hours and we haven't seen any stupid comets. Can we go now? I mean, Chandler's getting chilly.
Okay, here's batch 22. Ohh, maybe these'll taste a little like your grandmother's. This has a little bit of orange peel, but no nutmeg.
I just wanted to say that I hope you do have sex tonight and I hope that you guys get back together, but I must warn you, the night that you announce your engagement I'm going to announce that I'm pregnant!
Hey, see that snippy guy over there? He's the one who decides who gets up on the platform. We should go dance by him.
Dad, please don't pick your teeth out here! Alright, and if you're gonna put your feet up, why don't you sit on the-
Oh yeah! I saw her walkin' it down the street the other day. She had uh, these flowers in the basket. It was so cute.
Do you realize this is probably the last time we'll all be here in the coffee house as six single people?
Great! Well Rachel, the reason why I won't let you drive the Porsche is because you're a terrible driver. There! That wasn't about the wedding.
Listen, um honey, I appreciate this but you don't have to keep hanging out with them for me, I mean, they have each other.
'Cause I just keeping thinking about all these things that I'm not gonna have and it's freaking me out. I don't know what to do about it.
It's gotta be one of a kind. Y'know like umm, y'know uh, what's that God awful ceramic fruit bowl she has on her counter?
I cannot believe that I just spent the last two days trying to figure out the recipe and it was in my cupboard the whole time!
If we wanna get on camera, I think we have to get up on one of those platforms. They've been taping those people up there all day.
Yeah. Anyway, he told me about your apartment. And, um, I couldn't sleep, thinking about it. So, uh, would it be okay if I cleaned it?
Okay ah, please don't freak out. Umm, but ah, there's a blue fingernail in one of the quiche cups, and there's no way to know which one.
Y'know, I really have to tell Rachel, but I... We just have to get it over with! Y'know, the next time we see them we're just gonna tell them. Okay? That's it.
That is completely untrue. You think I'm high maintenance? Okay, prove it. I want you to make a list and we're going to go through it point by point!
Well... That's not the only time this was an issue. You remember when umm, you spent Thanksgiving with us? You called me fat.
Hey, it's Phoebe and Rachel. Um, why don't you tell them what you were telling me earlier about me not being high maintenance?
Ya know, my party is fun. I mean, maybe it's a little quieter, less obvious sorta fun but, you know, if people would just give it a chance...
Oh yeah, she didn't hire me out of pity, it wasn't so she could pick on me in front of her friends, she actually thinks I'm good.
I don't know! I don't-maybe you're feeling a little resentful. Maybe ah, maybe you thought you'd get married first! Maybe you can't stand the fact that your formally fat friend is getting married before you!
This would be a beautiful place to get married, yeah, but I wouldn't put the aisle there and I would never have the ceremony there! I mean you'd have the ceremony under this big beautiful arch.
Windows are clean, candels are lit. Uh, belt's to tight, gotta change the belt. Did I turn the fish? No, cause I made lasagne. Am I out of control?
Ohh, of course we are! We left it up to fate. If we were supposed to get married there would be a clear-cut sign.
Yeah, I'm sure your ex-wife will be more than happy to move to another country so you can patch things up with your new wife.
Aunt Syl, I did this as a favor, I am not a caterer. What do you want me to do with a dozen lasagnas? Nice talk, Aunt Syl. You kiss Uncle Freddie with that mouth?
Wait a minute! Unless, we give her all gifts she can use after she's done being pregnant. Like-like umm, regular coffee, Tequila.
I don't need an actual man, just a couple of his best swimmers. And there, there are places you can go to get that stuff.
All right. Op, here it is! Right underneath the can of-of bug bomb. I wonder if the best place to put something that cooks food is underneath the can of poison?
It's okay. It's okay. Just pretend that it didn't happen! Okay? No one needs to know! I mean, Phoebe's not an official ballplayer! I mean, only official ballplayers can drop the ball!
Oh, what'd ya bring me?! Awww, hotel toiletries from Japan. Oh, these are gonna go in my permanent collection. You want some coffee?
So what, he's a little older, big deal, I mean he's important to me. Ya know if you ask him, he might take you on his Jag.
Ohh... Oh, that's okay I hate when people come back to complement the chef. Like I have nothing better to do! So what's up?
All right, we still have a minute and a half to go, and we're down by two points. Two points.... Phoebe you do a button-hook again. Rachel, you go long.
Y'know what? He will forgive you. And I like to bring a pad with me when I go answer the phone just in case... Okay...
Oh, well don't take it to the same place you took the stereo, 'cause they've had that thing for over a week.
Okay. It's-it's about Alan. There's something that you should know. I mean, there's really no easy way to say this.. uh.. I've decided to break up with Alan.
Oh! Let's see, well...if this is the wedding hall then umm you're parents will be at home in Queens.
Hey, the point is that he was at everyone of your swim meets and he was there cheering you on! Okay? That's a, that's a pretty great dad.
We're going to Las Vegas to see your dad. It's time you two talked, and I want to get to know my father-in-law.
Honey, we were at this beautiful place, and I-I-I just put our names down for fun! I mean, what's the harm in that?
"Hi, uh, Richard it's Monica, um, listen I did something kind of crazy tonight, um, maybe I'm getting my period or something, I don't know." Nooo!!
I'm at work, ordinary day, you know, chop chop chop, sauti, sauti, sauti. All of a sudden, Leon, the manager, calls me into his office. It turns out they fired the head lunch chef, and guess who got the job.
Of course I wouldn't approve, I mean, you were totally in love with this guy who, hello, was gay. I mean, what the hell were you thinking?
You're supposed to double the tax. Not double the tax of Romania. I mean, what's-what's the deal? Are you, are you trying to buy me? Is this the way you get girls to go out with you?
Hi! If you're calling before Saturday, you've reached Monica and Chandler. But if you're calling after Saturday, you've reached Mr. and Mrs. Bing! Please leave a message for the Bings!
Okay, Rachel, do you have any idea how painful it is to tell someone that you love them and not have them say it back?
Oh my God, the cat's made my eyes water! Don't-don't throw it to me! My vision's been compromised!! Oh God! Okay. Okay. It's okay. Man, that was close.
Hey Rach, what about this? Huh? Who-who gets this? See, I don't know if I want it because it might be y'know, too many memories!
Myself. Y'know for remembering to pack a thing. Yeah, you do a good thing, you get a check! My mom does it, I never realised it was weird.
Oh, Rach! Rach! Umm hey, could you do me a favor and would talk to Chandler's dad and try to keep him away from Chandler's mom?
Anyway, Ross and I were always captains, and um, it got kind've competitive and one year, Geller Bowl VI, I accidentally broke Ross's nose.
Oh God! Orange juice just came out of my nose, but it was totally worth it. Oh my God, I completely forgot about your sound.
Oh, what a great argument, exhaling! All right, y'know what, I'll prove it to you, okay. I'll trade you Joey for Rachel, and I'll still win the game.
Would you stop? We've only been going out a couple of weeks, I mean we don't even know if he's gonna propose.
Look. I'm sure there's some friendly way to reconcile this! Um, have a seat. First of all, we haven't been introduced, I'm Monica Geller.
He's great! I mean we have such a good time together! He's so funny, and sooo sweet, and I'm not attracted to him at all!!
Well no wait a minute that's not true! No, what did, that was really sweet. And it kinda works out for the best.
Y'know what, don't tell us. We'll just wait until Chandler gets home, because it'll be more fun that way.
All right, come on guys, let's go! Tie score, and we're runnin' out of time. Forty-two!! Thirty-eight!! Hike!
I mean I-I thought you were nuts at first, but you-you did it. And now you can just look back at this thing with no regrets.
This is so typical. Y'know, we give, and we give, and we give. And then- we just get nothing back! And then one day, y'know, it's just, you wake up, and "See you around!" Let's go, Phoebe.
Umm, so how long have you been working with your dad? Come on, one of us had to mention him.
Y'know, I-I-I don't think that I can. So if you don't mind, maybe this will be it for me on the work things.
Hey, Rach! I made a pile of your stuff over on this side of the room. If you could just......throw your purses at it.
Why don't you phase it out? Yeah, fade the accent out and people will think you're, y'know, that you're adjusting to life in America.
I'm making a list of all the things that are most likely to go wrong at the wedding. Now, that way I can be prepared.
Well. Sounds like you're writing yourself a little play there Rach. Wow! Let me know how that one turns out.
He cannot play at our wedding! I mean everyone will leave! I mean come on, that is just noise! It's not even a song!
I have like five times, but the guy is so charming, that I go up there to yell and then I end up apologizing to him.
Hi, who's this? Hi, Joanne. Is Rachel working? It's Monica. Yes, I know I did a horrible thing. Joanne, it's not as simple as all that, ok? No, I don't care what Steve thinks. Hi, Steve.
What is the matter with you?!! Why aren't you more upset?! Aren't you gonna be sad that we're not gonna be living together anymore?! I mean aren't you gonna miss me at all?!
Umm, why don't you give me something that would be a good reason and-and then I'll tell you if it's true.
Okay, all right, I think you're great, I think you're sweet, and you're smart, and I love you. But you will always be the guy who peed on me.
Okay, all right, I think you're great, I think you're sweet, and you're smart, and I love you. But you will always be the guy who peed on me.
All right, I'm out of oven space. I'm gonna turn on Joey's. Please, watch him! Do not let Joey eat any of the food!
How do I tell Chandler that it's too soon. It's gonna break his heart, he's not gonna think that I don't love him anymore.
Chandler that's crazy! If you give up every time you'd have a fight with someone you'd never be with anyone longer than-Ohhh!
Y'know what? After you're with this woman for like ten minutes, you forget all that. I mean, she is this astounding person, with this, with this amazing spirit.
Wait a minute, Phoebe! We should be partners. We should be catering partners. I mean, think about it! You're not working right now, and we have such a great time together!
Okay? Over here we have pink suede, which is nice. But umm, if it gets wet then you know it's gonna shrink.
Well, so far I have uh, my bride's maids dresses won't get picked up, my veil gets lost, or I don't have my something blue.
Really, Rachel, I was thinking of you the whole time. Look, I'm sorry, all right. I never meant for you to find out!
You invite my brother, you invite my whole family, and not me?! Why?! What-Why wouldn't you want me at your wedding? What could I have possibly done?! Stuart!
Phoebe, your face is fine! Come on, none of this stuff is going to happen to you! Stop being such a baby!
Listen, uh, you told me something that was really difficult for you. And I, I-I figured if you could be honest, then I can to.
Oh it's so cute. I wonder what age it is when you stop being able to put both legs over your head.
But getting over was the hardest thing that I've ever had to do. And I never let myself think about you.
No! Y'know, the fantasy! Meet someone from a strange land, fall in madly love, and spend the rest of your lives together.
Ok, these were unbelievably expensive, and I know he's gonna grow out of them in like, 20 minutes, but I couldn't resist.
Because I don't have the money or the equipment to handle something that big on such short notice. I mean there's no way.
Look, these clowns are trying to take us for a ride and I'm not gonna let 'em! And we're not a couple of suckers!
Hey. Okay, so umm, since that video camera thing didn't work out uh, I thought that I would give you just a little preview.
Rachel you have to read this book. It's called Be Your Own Windkeeper. It's about how women need to become more empowered.
Y'know in a weird way, you have too much power. Look, you're gonna have to help me out here, 'cause I only have three.
Okay, if you need the vacuum, it's in my closet on the left-hand side. Ah, the garbage bags are next to the refrigerator...
Okay, Ben, I won't tell your daddy that you had ice cream for dinner, if you don't tell about our little bonking incident.
We thought since Phoebe was staying over tonight we'd have kinda like a slumber party thing. We got some trashy magazines, we got cookie dough, we got Twister...
Joey, put that down! Oh my God! It's Pete. Okay, get out!! How the hell do you answer a video-phone!
Hi, Dad. No, no, it's me. li-listen, Dad, I can't talk right now, um, but there's something, um... there's something that I've been meaning to tell you...
Wow, so you guys are, you're never gonna be in the same room together? How is that even gonna work?
Mom already called this morning to remind me not to wear my hair up. Did you know my ears are not my best feature?
Hi. Hi, uh, yes, this is Monica Geller. Um, I believe I'm taking some classes with you and I was wondering what they were.
Okay so this is where the band is. And this is where the bar is. And all these pins have people's names on them. And Rach, here you are.
I am really an idiot. you see, I was filling out my friend's form, and instead of putting her information, I put mine.
What?! I mean, I didn't work this hard and-and-and lose all this weight so that I can give my flower to someone like him!
Y'know what? I am really tired of your bellyaching! Okay, I-I worked really hard at making this a nice place for us to live!
All right, I'm gonna go steam my wedding dress okay? Who wants the responsibility of making sure nothing happens to it?
Come here. I'll make you feel like one of the guys. You know for a really cool guy, you suck at foosball.
Oops! Y'know, your birthday is in a month-and-a-half, what do you say I forget to get you a present for that too?
Because I need the money, and I thought that it'd be a great way to get rid of that last little schmidgen of self-respect.
Okay, everybody relax. This is not even a date. It's just two people going out to dinner and- not having sex.
I don't believe this! Wow, look at this refrigerator! It's gigantic! I mean I could live in this thing! I'd be cold, but I'm always cold. Oh my God, look at these spider burners! I love spider burners.
Chandler, here you go, got your traditional Thanksgiving feast, you got your tomato soup, your grilled cheese fixin's, and your family size bag of Funyuns.
Well I'm not sure yet, but umm of the top of my head I'm thinking double sided tape and some sort of luncheon meat.
It's not like I want to get married tomorrow! It's just that I-I'd like to believe that I'm in a relationship that's actually going somewhere, that I'm not just wasting my time!
Oh y'know what? If you're gonna be acting like this all night, I really, I don't even want to be around you.
Okay, how about the fact that he's engaged to another woman, who just happens to be your ex-best friend?
This wasn't addressed to Days of Our Lives, this is, this came to your apartment. There's no stamp on it, this woman was in our building.
Man, I would be great in a war! I mean, I really, I think I would make a fantastic military leader. I mean I know I would make General way before any of you guys.
No. Um, I know you like this, and I want you to have it. I think it'll look good in our apartment.
Well that's a little crazy. Although I am y'know glad to hear that you're branching out on what you look at on the Internet.
De-caff. Okay, everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor. This is everybody, this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my brother Ross?
Well, maybe you should send him something. So that when he gets to Las Vegas he'll know that you're sorry.
I'll get everybody else , finally we can start celebrating my- I'm sorry, uh apparently I've opened the door to the past.
Oh wait, you know what, I got it, I got it, pretend like you just woke up, okay, that will throw her off. Be sleepy.
I'll be coordinator! Oh my God! I'm so sorry, I didn't get you anything! Okay, look everybody has to help! Okay? You can help, can't you Phoebe?
Listen, I'm sure that dad doesn't care. He probably thought this was funny; he'll be telling this story for years!
Well, I just think the baby would keep falling off the dog. Do you, uh, do you , do you not see kids in our future.
I'm on top of the world, looking down on creation and the only explanation I can find, is the wonders I've found ever since...
Is it me? Is it like I have some sort of beacon that only dogs and men with severe emotional problems can hear?
Oh wow! Okay. Don't scare me like that okay? I mean for a minute there I was like, "Oh my God! The worst has happened!"
Honey, as we get closer to the wedding, is there anything that you would like to talk about or share?
So why-why wasn't Ross's stuff ruined? And if you say the words medical marvel I'm going to Easy Bake your head!
Because Phoebe and Gary are in that-can't-keep-their-hands-off-each-other-doing-it-in-the-park phase!
Oh, sure it does! In high school, you weren't jealous at all even though all your girlfriends were cheating on you!
I just tell her, I have to get it over with. I told Ross and Phoebe and she's the only one left!
The days and nights are hard! I get it! Okay? Look umm, Rachel I'm sorry! I have to start getting ready! I'm getting married today!
You gotta go home and get the earrings that you borrowed from me okay? Chandler wants me to wear them tonight.
Yeah. But of course we had to update it a little bit. Hey, by the way, great thinking about catching me!
Oh my God! Oh, this is incredible! Ohh! All right, y'know what? I'm just gonna roll right into that office and-and quit!
Well for your information he happens to be one of the brightest, most sophisticated, sexiest men I've ever been with.
No, those first two windows, that's the lobby. And y'know the other one over there, that's the stairway. You've been counting wrong.
I don't know, how about the idiot who thought he could drive from Albany to Canada on a half a tank of gas!
Hey guys! You found the presents? Chandler, you let them find the presents? Great! Do you know how long it took me to find you that water purifier?
Oh no, it is okay, I mean as long as you know that Chandler and I are also very hot and fiery, just as hot as you! I mean our flame, whew, is on fire!
Aww, sweetie, but it's not like you're not gonna have anything. You're gonna have nieces and nephews, and some ways that's even better.
I wish we at least knew his name... Look at that face. I mean, even sleeping, he looks smart. I bet he's a lawyer.
Well, after 15 years of mom and dad keeping it as a shrine to you, it's time the velvet ropes came down.
And when he's naked I can throw him out in the front yard and lock the door and all the neighbors will just humiliate him!
Ahh, Pete, the other day when you said you needed to talk, umm, just so I know, is it good news or bad news.
What are you being such a weenie for? So he has a Barbi, big deal. You used to dress up like a woman.
He just told me at the counter. He made me promise not to tell, but I couldn't hold it in any longer!
Look at these authentic fake medals. I tell ya, mom's gonna be voted best dressed at the make-believe military academy.
Come on Phoebe, let's go! Come on, it's time to get serious, huddle up. Joey, keep your head in the game.
When two people finally realise their feelings for each other, and-and they talk for hours, and they-they learn all about the other person!
Yeah, once again, I am sorry. Thank you. Bye. I just had to turn down a job catering a funeral for sixty people.
Sit down. All right? Please, just listen to me. You are terrible at this! Okay? You are the worst ultimate fighter ever! Ever!!
It's gonna be ok. Ryan's been under water. He's just gonna be so glad that you don't have barnicles on your butt.
But I figured, you know, that shouldn't change anything. I mean, what the hell does it matter how old we are.
Oh no-no-no, it's only one night a week, and plus I get to take all of you out for a lot of free dinners.
I'm sorry. But not that sorry, 'cause you don't have to live with it. Um, we have a reservation under the name Chandler Bing.
It's not a date, okay. I'm just gonna teach him how to make lasagne for some pot luck dinner he has.
You know what would be real weird? Is if you weren't there. Just say you'll think about it, okay?
Well umm, we were just talking about the y'know, the Swing Kings and just wondering whether y'know, they were the right way to go.
Okay, just stay there a couple more hours and if she doesn't show up by then, then just come on home.
Great! Umm, well what-what I was doing in Chandler's room is that umm, I was cleaning it! In fact, he pays me to clean it!
Well, you're making him a frieze salad with goat cheese and pine nuts, wild nuts, wild rice, roast asparagus, and salmon au croup.
Here, let me show you. Okay, the towels are hanging next to the sink, and umm, you can use the fancy soap.
I can't believe you married Duncan. I mean how could you not tell me? We lived together, we told each other everything.
No! Wait! I think I can figure out the recipe from this cookie! I do stuff like this at work all the time.
Well he is! Yeah, I mean marriage is all he talks about! My goodness, in fact, I'm the one that's making him wait!
All right, let me see. Will Chandler have sex tonight? Don't count on it. Seems like it works to me.
So, I went down to the post office, and it turns out it was those videos that I ordered for Richard about the Civil War. He loved the Civil War.
I figured out I need to charge seventeen bucks a jar just to break even. So, I've got a new plan now. Babies.
So I hide in the shower and the next thing you know they're going at it right on the bathroom floor.
No that is not what happened with us. Well, I was umm, I was really sad that night because this guy that I was Ross's mom.
Chandler! Everyone--no one's eating my Tuscan finger food 'cause they're all filling up on Phoebe's snow cones!
No, Ross, we do not hate Emily. We-we just, we just think that you're having to sacrifice a whole lot to make her happy.
Oh yeah, I remember mine! Ohh, it was my sixth birthday, my dad took me to the park, I got it, and...it bent.
When Mom and Dad drove you to the hospital to get your nose fixed, I swam into the lake and fished it out.
Here, I got it. I'll will play my message for you guys, and you can tell me if it's breezy enough.
Okay, but all right you're a guy, does it not freak you that you're never gonna sleep with anybody else?
Y'know, it is so strange seeing Ross here this time of day, 'cause usually he's got the children's hospital.
No you didn't. Oh and honey just so you know, now that you're marrying me, you don't get to win anymore.
Ohh, I'm so glad. Thank you so much for staying so calm during this. I mean it's really, it's made me stay calm. I coulda been worse!
Oh, I know, I never wear fake ones. I just did it so my Mom wouldn't give me grief about me biting them.
Okay, sperm donor number 03815, come on down! Okay, he's 6'2", 170 pounds, and he describes himself as a male Geena Davis.
MEG was good for me but I dumped her. Ya know, my motto is get out before they go down.
But, you see, it's just... this night has to go just perfect, you know? And, well, Wendy's more of a... professional waitress.
No, no, not a party. Just a surprise gathering of some people Rachel knows. Um, this is Phoebe and Chandler and Joey.
This is where I thought the barca lounger could go! You see you could see the TV and it's still walking distance to the kitchen.
No. If you thought this mess is going to bother me, you are wrong! All right, let's go Blinky! Chandler!!!!
What's to know? Buy sell, high low, bears bulls... Yes Manhattan...yeah telephone number of the stock...selling store.
Oh honey, we're close now but you-you wouldn't believe the years of-of nugies, and wedgies, and flying wedgies, and atomic wedgies, and.... That's where the waistband actually goes over your head.
Wow, this is so weird. I just realized this might be the last time we'll all be hanging out together.
She has a better chance of sprouting wings and flying up your nose than you do of not making fun of us.
Mom says it's all of Manhattan, parts of Brooklyn and Queens, and they have no idea when it's coming back on.
Oh my God, I can't believe what I'm getting ready to say. I wanna have a baby, but I don't wanna have one with someone who doesn't really wanna have one.
They can't all be bad. Find the one where you make your bedroom eyes. Ohh, there it is.
I mean, you're the one they're gonna come to when they wanna run away from home, and the one they talk to about sex.
Okay, I got it. Phoebe? All right, you pull. I'm gonna spread the legs as wide as I can. Joey? Now is not the time!
Dad, dad this is a good thing for me. Ya know, and you even said yourself, you've never seen Richard happier.
Ugh, I can not believe this! I mean, who is she to judge us? We could not have been nicer to her!
It is so great to meet a guy who is smart and funny, and has an emotional age beyond, like eight.
You are so cute! No. No, it was a fight. You deal with it and move on! It's nothing to freak out about.
Well sure! I'm just wearing sweats! But that's good that you're not in love with me, because you just want a girlfriend!
I know. But umm, one time there was this really dirty car in front of the building, so I washed it.
Sounds smart and healthy to me. So um, just out of curiosity, um, do you currently have any other racquetball buddies?
No-no-no, that's a video-phone. But hey guys you're not supposed to be here, so please, do not touch anything.
No! No you should! A lot of major actors do nude scenes! I mean the chance to star in a movie? Come on!
I know! Now look, there's only one problem though. There's only room for one, so I guess one of you will have to stay at Joey's.
Yeah, we switched meat suppliers at work, and the new guys gave me the steaks as sort of a thank-you.
You know, they're not actually supposed to have... I'll work on the lumps. Joey, you're going home, right?
Whoa-whoa-whoa, Phoebe you gotta take her! Y'know I-I-I said some really bad stuff about her, but y'know Rachel has some good qualities that make her a good roommate.
Okay, look, this is probably for the best, y'know? Independence. Taking control of your life. The whole, 'hat' thing.
Look, all we're trying to say is, don't let what happened with Carol ruin what you got with Emily.
Nononononono. Think who you're dealing with here. I mean, I'm not like you. I-I can't even stand in front of a tap class.
Look, if you want you can keep it at our place until you find out what to do with it.
Oh it's not big, not at all, you know, kinda the same lines as, say, oh I don't know, having a third nipple.
All right, so I haven't cleared the budget with my parents yet, but tell me how this is for music.
This is so wild. Ya know, I gotta admit, I was kinda surprised that you agreed to go on a blind date.
Y'know, I think if I were going to be with a woman. It'd, it'd be with someone like Michelle, she was so oh, she was so petite.
You actually broke her watch? Wow! The worst thing I ever did was, I-I shredded by boyfriend's favorite bath towel.
My mother's driving me crazy, but Ross is getting married. I'm happy. I'm not going to let anything spoil that.
Ok, all right. It was an accident, I swear, all right. I was putting on my jacket, and the thing, and the lamp, and it broke.
Well, I did one time, and-and I want to start doing it more. See that's what this is about.
No!! Why didn't you make a copy and-and keep it in a fireproof box and keep it at least a hundred yards from the original?!!
See? This is exactly why I'm making this candy. We can learn their names and get to know our neighbors.
Okay, I think that's it. The seating chart is done. This is our wedding. They all look like they're having fun don't they?
Ok, right about now the turkey should be crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside. Why are we standing here?
All right, I'm gonna show you something a lot of guys don't know. Rach, give me that pad, please? All right. Now...
Okay, I've got a question. If you had to pick one of us to date, who would it be?
No! To take more pictures of all of us together. I mean I really think it's the best resolution because everyone will enjoy the pictures.
Oh really, so that hysterical phone call I got from a woman at sobbing 3:00 A.M., "I'll never have grandchildren, I'll never have grandchildren." was what? A wrong number?
I give good massages! I used to give them to Rachel all the time before she got allergic! And-and-and Chandler loves them! Watch!
When girls hang out, we don't have pillow fights in our underwear. I'm sorry. We do. We do. I don't know why I said that.
Mom and dad just sent me in here to find out if you were trying to get Ross stoned!
If it makes anybody feel better, then we can just forget the thing, and we'll just do the gift.
Because it would totally freak him out and tomorrow's our anniversary. I just don't want anything to spoil that.
This baby has got everything. Take y'know, locations for instance. First, organized alphabetically, then geographically, then by square footage.
Ok, this is pumpkin pie with mockolate cookie crumb crust. This is mockolate cranberry cake, and these are mockolate chip cookies. Just like the Indians served.
So, maybe I am a little high maintenance. And maybe Rachel is a little bit of a pushover. But you know what we decided you are?
Okay, you stay here, and just wait by the phone. Spray Lysol in my shoe, and wait for Ross to kill you.
Deep Impact was the one with Robert Duval, Armageddon is what's going to happen to you if you wake me up.
Joey, what's it like on a movie set, huh? Do you have a dressing room? Do you have a chair with your name on it?
I don't believe this! When someone asks you in for lemonade, and to you that means they wanna have sex?
You just told me that he hates marriage! That-that he's a-a complex fellow who's unlikely to take a wife! That-that he's against marriage and always will be!
Yeah and you better watch the flirting too, cause you know, in such close quarters, it could be trouble.
You wanna finish this right now? All right, we get a deck of cards, high card wins. What do you say?
I love you. Hey listen umm, when, when you were talkin' about our future you said cat, but you meant dog right.
Well, the end table is wrong, The couch looks bizarre and don't even get me started on the refrigerator magnets.
We should get over there and see if she's okay. Just one...second! Score! Game! Come on.
Alright, but I'm very excited about this OK, so you gotta promise you won't get all big-brothery and judgmental.
Okay, look, I-I have enough stuff for one more sandwich, I mean I was going to eat it myself, but
Look, I don't even know how I feel about him yet. Just give me a chance to figure that out.
Chandler! It happens to lots of guys! You-you-you were probably tired, you had a lot of champagne, don't worry about it!
I had to go all the way to the basement because some idiot keeps stuffing the trash chute with pizza boxes!
Rachel if you, if you want to go out with him, you can. Sound like a big jerk to me but if that's what you want to do...
Look at us all dressed up for the big office party! By the way, what are we celebrating?
Hello? It's Joey. I'm so glad you called! Chandler told me what happened. Y'know he's really upset about it.
I'm fine now, but it was really scary there for a while. I mean, someone slipped a-a threatening note under the door.
I'm his sister, okay? I love him! I don't want to see him get hurt! Come on! Doesn't that give me the right to control him-help him?
Oh my God! We love that show! I mean Ross and I have been watching it since I can remember!
Yeah but see I have nothing to compare it too. So even if you're horrible, how would I know?
The strange part was, he was really nice, umm and he looks great, but I didn't feel anything at all!
You're right, you're right I shouldn't freak out. 'Cause this is what will happen when you and I have babies! When will that be?!
He used to lock himself in the basement for hours. No one was every allowed to hear, "The Sound."
Okay. But wait, we can't. My Cousin Cassie is in the guest room, we're supposed to have lunch.
Have you lost your mind? Chandler, this isn't about me! This is about you and all your weird relationship commitment crap!
Oh umm, how about your mom dying, or having to live on the streets when you were 14?
I'm gonna go put my make up on, we have to be at the hotel in an hour!
Are you crazy?! We own those two! I mean look at 'um, he can't breath and she's popping pills.
I don't know. Look he's a great guy and I love being with him but... you know. Things happen, and they happen. You don't plan these things.
Alright. If you guys don't want it to be special, fine. You can throw any kind of party you want.
Okay, just wait, please. I promise we'll come up with something. Just give us a little more time.
Hey! Continuing the countdown of your favorite meals. Tonight, No. 3, macaroni and cheese with cut up hot dogs.
I'd rather hang out with a sniveling work weasel guy when I can be hanging out with my boyfriend who I actually respect.
Oh, you mean like that guy thing where you act mean and distant until you get us to break up with you.
You see that guy? He's in classics now, but y'know as soon as we leave he's going straight to the porn.
Oh-ho-ho, sweetie, sweetie, you gotta stop saying that, now. It's no big deal, it's not even worth mentioning, you see we all do it all the time. See watch this, Ben, Ben, Ben. Ow, Monica bang! Everybody bang. Ben bang. Rachel bang. Bang, Rachel bang! Oh, isn't that fun?
Really! All right? Let's forget about this going home stuff and celebrate our anniversary. Okay, this is empty.
I'm gonna hang this basket on the door and when the neighbors walk by they can all take a piece.
Look, maybe this is none of my business, or maybe it is, I don't know... but, uh, I'm kind of worried about you.
Rachel, you can go down there, you don't have to smoke. Just say you wanna get some fresh air.
Okay, everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor. This is everybody, this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my brother Ross?
I'm not really here. Just thought I'd drop these off...on the way.. my way... Do you come here a lot? Without me?
Thanks. I'll call you tomorrow. Okay. Okay, let's let the Alan-bashing begin. Who's gonna take the first shot, hmm?
All right, there's some pizza at my place, we can all eat with one hand right? Are you with me?
What we did was wrong. Oh god, I just had sex with somebody that wasn't alive during the Bicentennial.
I've not seen her since high school graduation. Oh my God, that night she got so dru. . . motional.
Of course there's another guy!! This is even more perfect! Now you have to prove your love!
I can't wait to be with you! I'll just tell Rachel I'm gonna be doing laundry for a couple of hours.
Ok. Oh boy. You are doin' so good. You wanna squeeze my hand? All right, Ross, don't squeeze it so hard. Honey, really, don't squeeze it so hard! Oh, Ross! Let go of my hand!
No sweetie, you've got to win over the guy that controls C.H.E.E.S.E.! You've got to kiss some serious robot ass!
Hey, I just whipped us up some Easy Bake treats, they should be ready in about three days.
Wait a minute...Joey. Joey you can't ask her out, she's your roommate. It-it'll be way too complicated.
Joey, you know, maybe your just not used to kissing men, maybe you just tensed up a little, maybe that's what you need to work on.
Oh, and I can also speak a little French. Voulez-vous coucher avec moi ce soir? Why? What did I say?
All right, it'll be great! You just make her think you wanna have sex with her! It'll totally freak her out!
What Phoebe meant to say was umm, how come you're having a party and we're not invited?
I'm the hostess! Not those guys! I'm always the hostess! I mean, I was always the hostess, I mean even when I was little, I mean the girls brought their dollies to my tea party, I-I served the best air.
Come on Rach, when a guy says he's going to call, it doesn't mean he's going to call. Hasn't it ever happened to you?
Phoebe, it's okay that you don't want me to be your girlfriend because I have the best boyfriend.
Ohh, this is soo amazing! I can't believe my brother's getting married! And in London! It's so romantic!
Oh, um, around 8:02. We ah, talked for a little while, and then um, we went out for an innocent burger.
I gotta make up the guest bedroom. Hey, Cousin Cassie is coming to stay with us a few days.
Noo!! It's driving me crazy. I mean every other way he's like the perfect guy, he has everything. Plus! He actually has everything.
I will! But not tonight. For dinner music, I thought we could listen to that tape you made me.
Guys, could you please just stop throwing the ball for one minute and just help me find it!
Really Phoebs? Because, you know, you'd have to be an actual waitress. This can't be like your 'I can be a bear cub' thing.
Huuh, alright, Danny Arshak, ninth grade. Oh, c'mon Rach, you know the bottle was totally pointing at me.
Oh, I haven't had that feeling since I first started going out with Chandler. Wow, I'm never gonna have that feeling again am I?
Because your all gonna make up fake specials and make me cook them like you did the other night?
Oh my God! You own an Italian restaurant and you think that tastes good?! Where are you even from?
Behind my brother's back? ... is exactly the kind of crazy thing you won't be hearing from me.
Nice work everybody! So much for the y'know, "You can drive it, but don't tell Rachel" plan!
Yeah.. uh, but for future reference, that thing in your hand can also be used as a phone.
Why don't you just weigh out the good stuff about the relationship against the bad stuff. I mean that's what I did when I first weighing stuff.
Alright, for the bizillionth time, yes I see other women in shower at the gym, and no I don't look.
Okay, we'll start with the building. You guys take the first and second floor, Phoebe and I'll take third and fourth.
Yes. I hated you. I mean I, I, loved you in a 'you're my brother so I have to' kind of way, but basically, yeah, I hated your guts.
My god, if I had a nickel for every guy I wish I hadn't..., but this is about your horrible mistake.
Well, that's different. My lie didn't make one of us a felon in 48 states. What were you thinking?
Didn't you listen to the story? I mean, this is twisted! How could you get involved with a woman like this?
So I'm not supposed to share my doubts and fears with the guy I'm gonna spend the rest of my life with?
Doesn't it ever just freak you out that-that you're never gonna be with anybody new again?
You have nothing! You're not even going out! You're her baby sitter! You have a 12-year-old girl's job!
Ok, I'll tell you what. How about I cook dinner at my place? I'll make it just like Mom's.
Umm, excuse me, we switched apartments. You can't eat are food anymore, that-that gravy train had ended.
Tonight you're supposed to waitress for me, my catering thing, any of those words trigger anything for you?
Phoebe! You're sick, you shouldn't play. You should just go home, get in bed, and stay there.
I don't know, my hand feels weird. I guess it's because, I'm engaged! How long before it starts getting annoying?
How great are you, you little saver?! I mean, the-the amount you have is exactly the budget of my dream wedding!
So the wedding caterer sent me this list of twelve appetizers and I have to narrow it down to six.
No, I don't even know how serious he is about me. Until I do, I'm not telling them anything.
It is in the living room where there is also a light! And no one will kick you in the shin.
Phoebe, relax none of that stuff ever happens! They just put it on there for legal reasons!
Really? Wow, well then come on, I wanna show you how to fold the toilet paper into a point.
A jazz trio for cocktails. The Bay City Rollers for dancing. Wait, that was from my sixth grade wedding.
Ross! That is so sweet of you to get Phoebe that bike! When I heard the story, I almost cried.
All right then, go fight for her! Go to London! I mean, that could be you and Emily! That, but-but nicer. Just, go to London!
Hmm, no. I mean how can I accept a restaurant from him? I-I-I-I can't. I couldn't even accept a necklace from Stu Vincent in the seventh grade.
Hello? Oh, Hi, Ju Hi, Jew! Uh huh? Uh huh? Ok. Um, sure, that'd be great. See ya then. Bye.
Yes! Carol and Susan's caterer had a mountain bike accident this weekend, and she's in a full body cast.
What is it with you people! I mean, the minute you start to feel something, you have to run away?
No. No. Not it. Not it. Not it. Don't crowd me! This is it! This is the dress! Oh my God, it's perfect! I'm sorry, this one's taken! Whoa!
Now everybody knows the basic erogenous zones. You got one, two three, four , five, six, and seven!
Now everybody knows the basic erogenous zones. You got one, two three, four , five, six, and seven!
Well, I was thinking, that you gave the guys such great haircuts, I thought, maybe you'd like to do mine?
No, it doesn't, does it? But you wanted lumps, Ross? Well, here you go, buddy, ya got one.
Okay, those people just left, come on! Quick! Give him the money and get their table!
Yeah, well, I'm using noise. Okay. All right! So, is everybody ready? Here we go. I hear something! I hear something! Where is it?
Wow! You might just get the first Nobel prize in rubbing. So what country is this guy from?
Ya know, I was thinking. Ya know how we always stay at your apartment? Well, I thought maybe tonight we'd stay at my place.
Soon! I-I just couldn't before. You saw how upset Joey got! I couldn't do that to her, she's my best friend!
Oh that's okay. Don't worry about it, you can give it to me when we get back.
Well, umm, Walker was looking for this big bus load of kids.... All right, I get your point.
Did anybody else feel they just wanted to peel the skin off their body, to have something else to do?
What if I have babies, okay? I mean I'm gonna look different. I'm okay with that, but I'm not sure that you are!
Ah no, you see, someone was supposed to take them down around New Years... but obviously someone forgot.
Okay! Very funny! Somebody let me out please?! Come on, I'm cold! And covered in marinara sauce! Come on! Let me out!
Because! She's my cousin. I mean, we grew up together! We're family y'know? Well that's important to me.
White House adviser? Clinton's campaign guy? The one with the great hair, sexy smile, really cute butt?
Oh hey Joey! We've been watching all day, when are you gonna be on TV?
Phoebe! Rachel! It's Monica! I wonder what you could possibly need me for on such short notice! Oh.
Oh! Ohhhhh! Oh! Phoebe, come here. Aw, this is my new bed. You gotta feel this bad boy.
Yeah and if I had seven, maybe I would've said something like this, "Wow! My boyfriend's such a wise ass-seven!"
Honey, uh, this is a picture of the frame guy posing in front of a bright blue screen with a collie.
Okay, I'll be back in just a minute. Oh, Phoebe I'm sorry that I left lipstick marks on the phone.
And he came at us with an axe, so Rachel had to use a bug bomb on him!
We're supposed to uh, be spending a romantic weekend together, it-it, what is the matter with you?
Wow, all you need now is The Killing Fields and some guacamole and you've got yourself a part-ay.
I just checked my messages, and he said that when he gets back from Atlanta, we need to talk.
I think it's a great idea. Yeah, we could have a dinner party and just invite her close friends.
Come on, get into bed! I want to prove to you that I'm not sick! I wanna make you feel, as good as I feel.
Wow! You're a lot sturdier that Chandler. He crumpled like a piece of paper. So how was you're trip?
No, Phoebe, I'll tell you what, if you get ready now I'll let you play it at the wedding.
That is exactly why I do not lend you stuff!! Okay?! I mean, first it's my jewelry! And if it's not my jewelry, it's-it's my blue sweater! And if it's not my sweater, it's my sunglasses!
Can we turn the TV off? Okay? Do we really want to spend the entire weekend like this?
Chandler, if that dog's been here that long, and you haven't had a reaction, maybe you're not allergic to this dog?
I don't, I just, I just like the smell of them. So, uh, what are you really doing here Dad?
So do you guys gonna come over tomorrow? I'll make that pasta thing I was telling you about.
I said we are not going to do it, okay? Sometimes you can be such a, a big baby.
It is nothing like the Hobbit. It's like reading about every relationship I've ever had, except for Richard.
Oh, I'll have an espresso. Oh acutally, I'll get it. If I ask you to, you'll probably end up drinking it yourself.
Sweetie, with you it's gonna be different. The sex is gonna be great, 'cause you-you guys are in love.
That's mine!! Now, would you both please start acting like adults? And get me my cough drops!
Oh, then bring it on! Oh, unless of course your afraid you might lose to a bunch of girls.
Chandler there's nothing wrong with crying! I mean you don't have to be so macho all the time.
You do know that was me who just said that right? Hey. As long as we're both up...
No no no, if I couldn't pay you back right away then I'd feel guilty and tense every time I saw you.
I'll get it. Hello. Hi Emily! Yeah, uh you-you tracked him down. Hold on one second.
All right, look, I hate this as much as you, but if it makes you feel better, it's all your fault.
Oh, I wish there was a job where I could wear this all the time. Maybe someday, there will be.
I'm getting married today!!! I think I just cracked a rib. But I don't care because today's my wedding day! My day is finally here!!
Well, at least you're not hearing it for the first time at your fifth grade Halloween party.
Okay, looks like Ross and I are captains. Okay, so um, I bunnied first so that means I get to pick first. Joey.
It's beautiful! It's like the first bathroom floor there ever was. Whoa! Are you going in there for?
So, if you're parents hadn't got divorced, you'd be able to answer a question like a normal person?
So look umm, while we're st-still in London, I mean, we can keep doing it right?
So look umm, while we're st-still in London, I mean, we can keep doing it right?
That's right. That's right. And that is why you can't stay here tonight. And probably why you shouldn't come to the wedding.
Yeah, well I might be if I had the supplies! I mean, I could do all this stuff. Only I don't.
What are you talking about? She obviously lives on the second floor, seventh apartment from the left!
Alright, I tell you what, I'll give this to you now if you can tell me where we keep the dustpan.
Having a perfectly decorated tree is not what Christmas is about. It's about being with the people that you love.
All right, hold on okay? First thing's first. Okay, now did Ross sit anywhere while he was naked?
That's what we used to call your ah, your motorcycle in high school. Y'know how a motorcycle is a Chopper, and you're Chip. Nevermind.
Ok, which one of us do you think is gonna be the first one to get married?
So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks?
All right, fine. Tonight's potatoes will be both mashed with lumps, and in the form of tots.
Oh wait, wait, unless you happened to catch the Reruns' production of Pinocchio, at the little theater in the park.
They wouldn't have put it there if it didn't do something! How can you not care?
But Phoebe, you can go out with a creepy guy any night of the year. I know I do.
Come on. Hello? I'm sorry you have the wrong number. Okay, I'll call you later dad. I love you.
You know what? This is not over. We will play you again, and we will win, and you will lose, and you will beg, and we will laugh, and we will take every last dime you have, and you will hate yourselves forever.
Well, this is the last box of your clothes. I'm just gonna label it, "What were you thinking?"
Listen, we don't have to make that a guest room, we can think of something to do with the room together.
Yeah, she hates all mass produced stuff. She thinks her furniture should have a history, a story behind it.
All right Rachel, you sweep behind, I'll pitch it to you, you throw it down field to Phoebe. All right. Break.
You know that's nice, y'know we could put it back there after the surgeons remove it from your colon!
Probably the only time I'll ever say this, but did you see the ass on her?
Yeah you will! The right guy is just around the corner! Okay, are we done with that?
Oh, absolutely. Yeah, you know I'm not even thinking about that thing that we're not supposed to think about.
You know what? It seems like you've been making an awful lot of stuff Irish lately.
Then you'd be going back and forth all the time, I mean it doesn't make any sense.
Then you'd be going back and forth all the time, I mean it doesn't make any sense.
Well...honestly ever since we got engaged I have been waiting for something to, to flip you out.
Rachel, if you want the little round waffles, you gotta have to wait until I find the little waffle iron.
No, to get a table! Places like are always shakin' you down. Everybody wants to be paid off.
No Joey! Chandler could be your assistant! See, he could answer all of your fan mail and stuff!
You know it's funny, the last time Paulo was here, my hair was so much shorter and cuter.
But either way... You're gonna get married, you're gonna be happy, my mom's gonna like you better than me.
Yeah, well, I'll take a little crying any day over Howard-the-"I-win"-guy. "I win! I win!" I went out with the guy for two monthsI didn't get to win once.
Look at me! My big concern is what's real?! Oh my God. We're really sad, aren't we?
No, no, no. They say it's the same as the distance from the tip of a guy's thumb to the tip of his index finger.
Oh, just some pictures I made and hung up. I thought they'd brighten up the place. They do don't you think?
Would you look at them. Am I ever gonna find a boyfriend again? I gonna die an old maid.
Pheebs, you've been up for 24 hours! Go to sleep, honey. Th-this isn't healthy.
Here's your key. All right, you have to christen it! Now, go out and come back in!
And for our two-week anniversary, he's gonna take me to his cousin's cabin for the weekend.
Now I'm guessing that he bought her the big pipe organ, and she's really not happy about it.
Here. Ben, do you wanna play the airplane game, do you wanna show Rachel? Come here. We're gonna do something fun. Okay. Weee!! Weee!!
This is so bizarre. I guess it kinda makes sense though, y'know she had such a terrible childhood.
Do you umm, you really think the best reason to get married is because you're sorry?
Well, CHP because I used to have a crush on Eric Estrada. And ZXY becuase I think it sounds zexy.
Oh now that-that-that's funny, it seems like Chandler's conference could've been in Connecticut or Vermont.
Alright, I'll tell you what. I'll come get you in 5 minutes with some sort of um, kabob emergency.
We were on the platform, ready to dance the world into the new Millennium, and the guy yelled 'CUT!'
Y'know what, this is obviously some kind of twisted joke she's trying to play on him.
Let's take a walk. Y'know maybe you should consider writing for Talking Out of Your Ass magazine!
Let's just do it right now. Okay? It won't be hard. Just say what's in your heart.
Good, so do it Saturday night because we're going to dinner with her and Clark.
Please, when he left town you stayed in your pajamas for a month and I saw you eat a cheeseburger.
Rach, you're in a great place in your life. Come on, you've got a great job! Good friends...
So uh, Joey and Chanlder, I, I think it's time that you take Dr. Greene over to your place.
Okay, so, uh, we're in France, we're making the toast. Do you see a little bassinet in the corner?
I'm so sorry that you had to find out this way. I'm sorry, but it's true, I love him too.
That's Paul's watch. You just put it back where you found it. Oh boy. Alright. Goodnight, everybody.
No. No you can't go. No this is fun. Come on we're just getting started. Here, here's your marker.
All right look, if I take Chandler out of the running will you be able to focus?
Joey, what are you doing? You promised Phoebe you wouldn't eat meat until she has the babies!
Joey, what are you doing? You promised Phoebe you wouldn't eat meat until she has the babies!
Well, he told me he was going out with the guys, I just didn't know that you were the guys.
Did you like her? And I'm just asking as a friend, because I am totally fine with this.
All right, you just make sure that Chandler catches the ball, I'll take care of the rest.
That is so sweet. I know that I was acting a little crazy but umm, I feel the same way.
Just go up to her and ask her out. Oh, what's the worst thing that could happen?
Yes. Well I got his machine and I left a message. But it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, because you know it was like a casual, breezy message. It was breezy! Oh God, what if it wasn't breezy?
Y'know if it's any consolation, he really did sound like he was having more fun with you.
Oh, you must be freezing. You know what you need? How about a nice steaming cup of hot Mockolate?
I'm telling-If you put that in her apartment you'll never hear the end of it.
Wasn't it a lot more exciting when we were y'know all over each other all the time?
No. It was painful. Oh my God , they should call it Pain-zine, now with a little wax.
It's just that he doesn't have that much free time, ya know, and I don't know, what do I do?
Oh, she was a cruel, cranky, old bitch! And I'm sorry she died. Did Dad say I get the dollhouse?
Wow! That's great! Dad must really like you, he doesn't ask just anyone to play.
Phoebe knows and she's just trying to freak us out! That's the only explanation for it!
Gee, I don't know Rach. Order up!! I got a Yentel soup, a James Beans, and a Howdy hold the Dowdy!
Joey, I left my watch on the counter last night. It was right here, where is it?
So! So we've got to go upstairs and have a lot of sex to prove them wrong!
Y'know what we should do? We should all get dressed up and go to have champagne at The Plaza.
So big deal, so Joey's had a lot of girlfriends, it doesn't mean he's great in bed.
Y'know when girls sleep with guys with weird things on their body, they tell their friends about it.
Ross, come sign this birthday card for dad. Rich is gonna be here any minute.
Look , I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have.
Oh, it was great! The widow wouldn't pay, so Phoebe yelled at her 'til she did.
Chandler, umm, I want you to take just a minute and I want you to think about how ridiculous this sounds.
Get all freaked out because everybody was talking and just joking around about marriage and stuff.
Well, if you had kept listening, you-you would have heard me call him Mr. Big......ot.
'Cause they took our apartment, I wanted to punish them. But I'm-I'm done now. They've suffered enough.
All right. But umm, I-I-I'll pay you back all the money you invested, and you can keep the van.
Okay, guys! The candy is coming; I just need another 15 minutes for the chocolate to cool!
All right, well why don't I go out with an ex-boyfriend and do Joey a favor?!
Um, you guys, you know when I said before, "thank you, but I don't really need your help"?
I can't do it. I'm sorry, I wish I could, but umm, see you have these feelings for me....
Okay, I'll rest. But y'know if I'm going to bed, then you're coming with me.
Oh gosh, listen if you and Chip do it tonight, promise me you'll tell me everything.
Well I think the length of teasing is directly related to how insane you were so, a long time.
All right then, when I'm done with this place, it's gonna be ten times better than that place!
I don't know how museums work in England but, here, you're not supposed to take stuff.
Perhaps, you would like me to turn like this, so that you can bunny bump against my back.
What? You freak! You wouldn't even have known about this place if it wasn't for me!
Nope, sound like me. Pheebs, it's going great. Look at Chandler with little baby girl Chandler.
Okay. Umm, y'know, I don't think, I don't think I told you this, but umm, I just got out of a really serious relationship.
Really? Okay, so why don't you tell me what happened to Ross Junior year at Disneyland?
Well it wasn't that many guys. I mean, if you consider how many guys there actually are, it's a very small percentage.
Chandler, please! Do you know how unbelievably glad I am that Joey was not there that night?!
I know!! Chip? Hi! It's Monica. 'Kay. 'Kay. Okay. Okay, good-bye. Oh my God, we just had the best conversation!!
Come on guys! Suck it up! We're closing in on ten hours! It's gut-check time!
Umm, listen I am sorry, but I'll put some out first thing in the morning.
Okay. Okay, I can't wait! This is going to be the best Valentine's Day ever! I can't believe it! Make the presents! Make the presents!
Ohhh! What are you doing to me?! Oh look, I-I... I'm sorry but umm, this-this-this-this is not going to happen.
See there you go. Woo! We're out of the woods. Okay, I'll get dressed now.
Rachel, what's going on? I mean isn't this the same Barry who you left at the altar?
Well, she corned me! She asked if the wedding was in town! I mean, what was I supposed to do?!
Well, I-I-there was this guy at the bank that I thought was cute umm, but I don't anymore.
Wow, you seem to be doing so much better. That's great. So how-how are things going?
Well, are you asleep right now, Joe? 'Cause I don't think you have to wear it unless you are!
'Cause if you do that means you'd be cancelling it for me, and we're just friends.
Sorry! I'm just-I'm not very good at this! I'm a terrible liar and I hate having to lie to Rachel!
I wanna buy 5 shares of SGJ and I wanna buy them now. C'mon time is money my friend. Thank you. Wooo.
All right people listen, I've got exactly twenty-eight minutes before I have to baste again.
I have no moves. Okay, whatcha doin' there?! Oh y'know what? I'm sorry, this is just too weird.
You know, that's true. You'd be a great person to have around the day after an emergency.
Am I on fire today or what?! Those birds are browned, basted, and ready to be carved!
I just-I can't believe that you think that you and Chandler know me and Rachel better than we know you.
All right people, we're in trouble here. We've only got 12 hours and 36 minutes left. Move, move, move!
You're going to talk to him! Y'know what? We made a deal, I make your decisions and I say you're going to talk to him.
Well, uh y'know, our guy works with Chandler and he's really nice and smart and he's a great dresser!
Drunk enough to know that I want to do this. Not so drunk that you should feel guilty about taking advantage.
Ugh, y'know, umm we gotta get up early and catch that plane for New York.
Ugh, y'know, umm we gotta get up early and catch that plane for New York.
I am not 'so'! OK, I was a teensy bit weird at first, but... I'll be good. I promise.
I'm glad you're here, we have a couple of things to ask you about the wedding ceremony.
We left Joey alone with the food! Yep! Yep, I knew it! There he is... feeding stuffing to a dog!
Yeah, ours pretty much sucked, oh, but, I did run into little Stevie Fisher. Remember him?
I know being spit on is probably not what you need right now. Um... how long?
Hey, Rach. How was it with your friends? Okay! How would you like some Tiki Death Punch?
Am I doing here? Why? Surprised to see me? Ross brought me. How do you like that?!
Oh, what about that guy over there? Remember? That is the guy you flirted with at the counter that time.
Honey, you made the bed again. I told you, you don't have to do that. This isn't camp.
Oh my God! Joey, what did you do after you threw her leg on the fire?
Well, an-anyway, I just-that night meant a lot to me, I guess I'm just trying to say thanks.
Well, an-anyway, I just-that night meant a lot to me, I guess I'm just trying to say thanks.
Yeah-Oh that's right. You, you always wanted me too. Hey, I see you got your mustache back.
Uh, no. Loosely translated 'We should do this again' means 'You will never see me naked'.
Because they don't know we're dating. Do you think we should eat in the kitchen?
No. No, just, just, just a couple more boxes. It-it-it's no big deal, all right, I'm-I'm cool. You gotta help me out with a couple more boxes!
Oh, I don't know. Maybe, um, "That was nice?" Admit something to me? "I'll call you?"
Not that, this, US. Oh my God, Ross, you-re, you're, it's jus-, you-, ever sin- you been here.
And what if I was still fat? Well, you wouldn't be dating me, that's for sure.
You guys haven't gotten your presents yet? Tomorrow's Christmas Eve, what're ya gonna do?
Y'know, I only know of two surefire ways to shut a man up. And one of them is sex.
You know, when you start get screwed over all the time, you gotta switch to low-fat.
It's easy! Just keep it casual! Give him a kind word, shake his hand and give him the money!
Phoebe! I have to have those earrings, we're going to leave as soon as the show is over.
Now Joey, you go down there and you suck up to him. I mean you suck like you've never sucked before!
Does it have to do with-with Chandler and that sock that he keeps by his bed?
Money is so impersonal. Cookies says someone really cares. . . Alright, we're broke, but cookies do say that.
Oh my God! It's true!! Oh my God you are so amazing! Oh my God, can I just ask you to do me oh, just one favor?
Come on Chandler, come on! It'll give us great practice for when--people with babies come to visit.
Sandra, I am so sorry, I thought you were Rachel and we just weren't ready for you yet.
So how does this work, you going to balance the plates on these little guys' heads?
Okay. I gotta call Michelle. I gotta see if that was her voice or not. I'm sorry, I just have to.
Rachel would be Phoebe's, I would be Rachel's, that way we all get to do it once and no one would get upset.
Okay, this is the den. All right, check this out. Lights! Whoa! All right. Less lights! Bad lights! Lights go away! Oh, see you just need to find the right command.
Oh come on, it's only fair, you paid for the flight. Now is, is that enough lire?
Yes. Uh, yes, I did. That was my friend, Eddie Moskowitz. Yeah, he likes it. Reaffirms his faith.
In one year?! My God what did she eat? Her-her family! That's not the point.
Well, it's the thought. Hey, doesn't Ross's flight get in in a couple hours? At gate 27-B?
Hello, this is Monica... Yeah??? Oh... Okay, yes, we'll be right, we'll be right down. Thank you.
Noo!! The point is that is was you that was there that night! It is you that I am marrying! It is you that I feel in love with!
Rachel, say that I'm friends with her, we spend some time together. Is that so terrible?
If someone wants to give us a present, we don't want to deprive them of that joy.
I can't believe you're dressing up for him. I mean, you're just, you're setting yourself up all over again.
Damnit! Y'know this whole time we were concentrating on watching the babies and, and no one was watching Chandler!
I need a few more things to make the margaritas. Uhh, I need some salt, some margarita mix, and tequila.
I know, I've been looking at those doors, they look pretty sound proof, don't you think?
I know, I've been looking at those doors, they look pretty sound proof, don't you think?
How about if I dance around all covered in sauce? Huh? You think it's funny now?
All right, that's it. You know what? Just get out of my way and stop moping.
Yeah, but her plane got delayed in Athens. But actually, she should be here by now.
All right shut up for a second and let me just see something. Oh, wow!
Do you think things would have been better if you'd just told her the truth?
All right, just give it back to me when your done. See you guys.
Wow, for a guy who's recently lost his job, you're in an awfully good mood.
Oh my God, sit down! Sit down! How long as it been since we've seen each other?
Hey! Okay, so I thought we'd start with my make up and then do my hair.
Look umm, of all people, you do not want me to tell this story!
I'm just having one of those days where you realize you're in a dead-end relationship!
Oh, that's great! I mean I'm-I'm sorry, but I'm so happy for you. And now I can work for you!
It was, it was really nice. We started talking and I-I ended up having lunch with him.
You better believe he's tired, after the day we had! If you know what I mean. You know what I mean?
Just out. Had some lunch, just me, little quality time with me. Thanks for your jacket.
Wait, you can't have the baby here! I mean I haven't sterilised it since the guys moved out!
Are you kidding?! I get a Porsche and the barca lounger's gone?! This is the best day ever!
Y'know, in my defense, umm there was no glitter on the macaroni and very little glue.
You would not. I can't believe this. I hate this, you're too normal. I can't believe my boyfriend doesn't have a thing. My boyfriend doesn't have a thing.
Oh my God. You guys! You gotta come see this! There's some creep out there with a telescope!
Oh, I've got it! I have got it! Pictures from your childhood. This will get you going good!
Phoebe, you got Joey drums to annoy Rachel, so she wouldn't wanna live there anymore?
Wait a minute, are you doing Joey's "Audition didn't go so well. Yeah it did?"
Yeah, tacos! Ever since you told me that story I've had such a craving for them.
Oh! Why didn't you tell me? I made him his own individual sweet potato stuffed pumpkin.
And the musicians, look, they can go over here , okay? And the chairs can face this way , and... You go.
I'm gonna go into the bathroom so I can look at it in the mirror, as I eat it.
Maybe. Joey: Wait. Your 'not a real date' tonight is with Paul the Wine Guy?
Okay, but wouldn't it be easier if you had to tell me something that you could tell me.
My God, Rachel, I can't believe Phoebe made out with Ralph Lauren. Ohh, I'm so jealous.
I'm so sorry, I can't believe I did this, but I couldn't stop laughing at your Norman Mailer story.
Hey Gunther. Hi. I mean you're going out on a date with the noisy guy upstairs?
Oh God! He's gonna come by and borrow some candles for his big date!
Oh, Rachel, sweetie, look, here's a really cute picture of Joey and you at the reception.
Could you guys please try to keep it down, we're trying to start a Boggle tournament.
Wait a minute. Are you honestly telling me that-that you may never want to get married?
He's not great umm, but he's dealing with it. Oh wait a minute, you're not gonna try...
What?! You can't shed a tear for your dead wife!! Now, I left you a note from the beyond!
Yeah... ..see, I was supposed to get married, but, um, I left the guy at the altar.
Alright, before I tell you, uh, why don't you tell me how many women you've been with.
Well uh, I'm trying to make something for Joey. Do you mind if I raid your fridge?
Joey they're not real. I start miles beneath the surface of these things, ok, they're fake. See honk honk.
Please? Please?! We just don't want to deal with telling everyone, okay? Just promise you won't tell.
Please? Please?! We just don't want to deal with telling everyone, okay? Just promise you won't tell.
I didn't even tell him to say that. . All right you're off my list.
The woman that got married a bunch of times and killed herself when you were 13?
How many perfectly fine women are you gonna reject over the most superficial insignificant things?
Hey! Oh, I'm so glad you're home, I thought tonight we could finally organize these photos!
Yeah... Yeah, I know it's pretty selfish, but haha, hey, that's me. Why don't you try the hummus?
Yeah. All right, I'm gonna go tell Dan that it's not gonna happen. Don't do the dance.
You're right, I'm sorry. It's not like you're y'know, going out with an ex-girlfriend.
It's okay. I suppose it could happen to anyone, not anyone I know, but... By the way I can still see it.
Y'know, no point in dragging it out. Dragging out the long process of you moving out and us not living together anymore.
How she drove you crazy, picking on every little detail, like your hair... for example.
Oh no, she's still at work, but she told me to tell you to call her.
Okay, listen, there's still some of Chandler's medicine under the sink in the bathroom. Bye!
No-no, I-I just, I liked them so much that I went out and bought some for myself.
So how you doing today? Did you sleep okay? Talk to Barry? I can't stop smiling.
No no. See, in my bedroom I set my clock six minutes fast. You wanna know why?
Wow, come in, have a seat. You must be exhausted coming all the way from...Texas.
And Dad, y'know that mailman that you got fired? He didn't steal your Playboys! Ross did!
Well, she was shocked when I told her, but then again so were most people.
I just don't think arcade games go in the beautiful guest room. The beautiful guest room is gonna be filled with antiques.
Y'know what, I think we should play a game. I mean come on, it's been twelve years.
Oh, I'm sorry. Of course I mean that. Interesting idea, umm, talk about it, but no.
What you guys don't understand is, for us, kissing is as important as any part of it.
Yes it is. You see I've always found the men's bathroom very sexual. Haven't you?
Well, every, every Thanksgiving um, we used to have a touch football game called the 'Geller Bowl.'
Alright, I'll give you the ear thing but don't you think the ending was pretty wonderful?
Oh, Phoebe, she couldn't stop crying! With those thick glasses, her tears looked giant.
What are you talking about? She just invited him to the biggest party of the millennium!
Um, I straightened out your shower curtain so you won't get mildew. What? To me that's nice.
Well, my financially challenged friends, I split my money and I bought some shares of CHP and ZXY.
What the... Yes you're too late! Where was all this three years ago?!
Hey, do you realize that at this time tomorrow we'll be getting married?
Oh my god! Did you hear that? She said Monica! Oooh, I can't leave her!
Oh, you really want to talk about getting people to like you huh, funny man?
You are going to make a joke about my special present! Why would you do that?!
I can't believe this. Do you think that your parents could help pay for it?
Oh, good to see you too. Did you come down here to tell me that?
This is crazy! I mean, it's such a stupid argument. I don't even wanna see Richard again.
Well, she actually has a boyfriend y'know herself, named Clark. Uh, she also kinda invited herself to our wedding. Clark too.
No, my eye doctor is Richard! I can't go to him when I don't have a boyfriend!
I got it! How about, if we win, they have to get rid of the rooster?
You, and you, you're supposed to be at my party. And Gunther! What are you doing here?
I don't have anything like that, but let me go see if Rachel does.
Oh, then you do know it. So um what kind of things do you write about?
Ok, the first person's most embarassing memory is, 'Monica, your party sucks.' Very funny.
Well, they're just gonna have to wait aren't they? I've only got two hands!!
Chandler could you at least send some women to my party? Alright that's Ross.
You're not dressed yet?! We're supposed to start having fun in 15 minutes!
Okay, one more, please. Come on, I'm gonna get it in this time, I will.
Okay, good, 'cause umm, well maybe we could have a little workout of our own...
Doctor, can I see you for just a minute please? My brother has a slight phobia about needles.
Okay. I'm guessing that if you don't want to deliver, you probably don't want to pick stuff up either.
All right ah, Ross, this is the extent of my knowledge on the subject. Call Rachel.
Alright, you know, we got it, we got it. Let's play for real. High stakes... big bucks...
They love each other, and they wanna celebrate that love with the people that are close with them.
Oh yeah? Well when you learned how to dance did you forget how to put on underpants?
All right fine, your guy may have a great body, but our guy is really funny.
It was okay. She's still kind of depressed because she broke up with her boyfriend.
Chandler, listen to me sweetie, I know you can do this. Okay? You have a beautiful smile.
I think this is so great! I mean, you and Ross! D-did you have any idea?
