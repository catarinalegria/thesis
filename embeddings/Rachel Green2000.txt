I couldn't be inner. Monica?
All right, bye-bye.
No, no-no, it's okay, calm down. Mark and I talked, and I realised how much I love your stupid brother, and, yeah, we got our problems, but I really want to make it work.
Umm, Joanna? I wanna talk about that interview.
Aw. Hey, Pheebs, want this?
Yeah.
Do you really want an award you didn't win?
Oh my God!
Got a job on a river boat?
Oh honey thank God you're home, I was getting worried.
Really?! You think that will work?
I'm gonna go get one of those job things.
Why, when did you get out of the game?
You wanna go inside and have some coffee?
Hi.
Pheebs, I don't think anyone's mad about that.
Oh, if I only want two kids, can I keep him for another year?
Okay! "Hello Ross, this is Dr. McNeeley from the Fake Accent University, we'd like you to come on board with us full time!
What?
Uhhh, yeah. But it's not obvious why.
Me either. Umm, all right, first thing I need you to do is go downstairs and find a women named Hilda and tell her to go home.
No, no no no, don't need to know the details.
It's a different guy!
Joey! It is an auction! You don't guess, you buy!
Oh, I'm sorry, did my back hurt your knife?
Oh really, OK.
Oh wow, uh okay, uh maybe. Umm, yes, I can do that!
I didn't know that.
Chandler, you stole this cheesecake. That is wrong.
What?
I haven't seen it yet!
I was just getting him to like you.
Nothing.
Excuse me, there was no time!
Here, kitty-kitty. Here kitty-kitty. Where did you go, little kitty-kitty-kitty? Here kitty-kitty-kitty-kitty...
Ohh, so no sign of Emily huh?
Is he okay in there?
You know what?
Oh, no, Michael, it's not you. I'm sorry, it's just, it's this thing. It's probably not as bad as it sounds but this friend of mine is, is getting a cat with his girlfriend.
Yeah, but how much can you tell from a look?
It's the same story.
Oh.
Chandler, this is not addressed to you. This is addressed to Mrs. Braverman downstairs. Thief.
I don't know, his uh, his hair never really bothered me that much, and y'know it was always more crunchy than it was greasy.
We... We are not... ...going to let it... be a problem.
Hey!
Oh, no, no, I don't have one. I just need to talk to my friend.
Yeah, and-and you better make sure he tips you this time.
Yeah! But I don't know what he looks like!
I think I just shipped 3,000 bras to personnel. Oh honey, I gotta go. Mark, I need you!
Wrong! How do you get the mainsail up?
Why aren't you at work?
Well, y'know what? Actually, I was about to bid on this lovely trip to Paris.
Um, there was a Geller Cup?
So, how are you?
Oh, god.
What?!
I tried! They won't take her back.
Excuse me, I wanted you to help, but you couldn't move your arms because you were wearing three life jackets.
You're so pretty.
Ok. That's fine.
Oh!
Okay.
Oh Ross, hi! Hey, how are ya? There you are!
And do you remember going into my purse and stealing the phone?!
Umm, well let's see uh, this one is Tom Brokaw.
Wow. Wow, that's great. Great. Ok, wow, you know what.
Hi, Pheebs.
Okay, but before you go, could you help me first?
Monica.
Oh, here's that trench-coat that you wanted.
Hey!
Im okay! Im okay! Mr. Heckles, Mr. Heckles could you help me please?
Joey, y'know you get any mustard on that bag, you can't return it.
Men just take out wind?
What?!
Awful, absolutely awful.
Well okay-Well don't ruin it! Just play along at least!
So this is Brooklyn.
Some of them.
You're hurt!
What? Wait-wait a minute, what? Phoebe, what's the matter?
Where's Chandler?
Yeah, I'm good.
You walked around all night in the city by yourself?
No! Wait! Come on!
Okay, um, I... All right Phoebe look, I just wanted to say that I'm sorry. OK? I handled the situation horribly and I should not have lied to you.
Really? You think so?
Well, he doesn't really love her. I mean, it's just a rebound thing from me.... You'll see!
Chandler, you have an assistant right?
Thank you. Thank you. I love you.
No! Don't say that! Don't say that!
Well, now, how come you guys have never played poker with us?
Yeah, I do. I think you should go, by yourself, get some distance, clear your head, I think it'd be really good.
Well, I kind of... I kind of lost him.
Hey!
Ohh, well I'm not totally back yet, but thank you.
You need that, you need that too 'cause obviously, a thief could just tear this up.
I can make you a legend. I can make you this generation's Milton Berle.
Oh-oh, sorry, it's this way, it's this way.
Good different?
Oh good God! I've fallen down!
OK, listen, I'm sorry about last night and I really want to make it up to you.
Yeah, I...
And-and what else?
Oh, come on! You think that's gonna work on me?! I invented that!
Oh my God!! You just ruined the thing I was practicing the whole way home, but I'm soo happy!
Well, you know I'm not surprised. I mean have you seen them together, they're really cute.
Okay, oh, here's what you do. Just act like everything around you turns you on.
All right, all right, all right. Last night, I had a dream that, uh, you and I, were...
Joey, you are not! You're 31.
Yeah.
Monica, will-will you marry me?
Oh please, theyve been going out a week. They havent even slept together yet, I mean, thats not serious.
Oh, oh, this is good, this is really good.
Phoebe! You picked Joey and Ross?! You can not have two backups!
I know.
Oh yeah? Startin' to feel her again there are we?
But see, it was a plan. Y'know, it was clear. It was figured out, and now everything's just kinda like...
Okay.
Okay, y'know what?! I know-I know how to settle this! All right here, this is what we're gonna do! I'm gonna write Joey on one napkin and I'm gonna right Ross on the other napkin and we are going to pick one! And that person is going to be our backup! Okay?
Or Carol! But they're funny to kids and who is it hurting?!
No, just singing.
Do you got your gracious loser face?
Well we're gonna miss you around here.
Whoa! Hey-hey, you planning on inviting us?
Oh, well, I guess I had that one coming. I'm just gonna throw it out, it's probably just a bunch of shampoo and...
Which one do you think she is?
Oh no, wait a minute, wait, I've got a presentation tomorrow. I can't miss that.
Great, people having sex, that's just what I need to see.
Uh no, he's not. Can I take a message?
Well since I'm movin' out and-and you're so beautiful...
She's totally right! When we were together, you got all freaked out about Mark and there was nothing going on.
Yeah, which, by the way Chandler, I would like back one of these days.
Yes, his name is Barry, he's a doctor, thank you very much.
Um, this is gonna sound kinda goofy but uhhm, my friend over there, who cooks by the way, um, she thinks you're cute.
Okay.
Your fly is open, Geller.
Fine. Fine, but I'll have you know that once I taught him that stuff he called me Fun Aunt Rachel. And I loved being Fun Aunt Rachel but I'll go back to being Boring and Uncomfortable Aunt Rachel if that's what you want!
Oh my God, Melissa Warburton. I don't think I have the energy for this.
Where ya going?
Oh that's right! I'm sorry! I-I am early! Finish! Please!!
Phoebe, you were right. I should've never gone to London, and from now on you make all of my decisions for me.
Excuse me, can I, can I bum one of those? Y'know what, actually... Okay, okay, okay, what's so funny over here?
Ohh, wait a minute, we haven't pre...
That was amazing. I can't even send back soup.
Hi!
I am. Let me just get my coat.
Monica look! Look-look-look! Here is that table that I ordered.
Ow!
Well you know, after about thirty or forty fights, you kinda catch on.
Well, last time I almost got fired. You must end it, you must end it now!
Hey!
Okay.
I'm fine! I'm fine! I'm just losing a tooth, it's no big deal. I have a dentist! Y'know. I'm gonna go put some ice on it. Excuse me. What do I do now? What do I do now?
Oh my god!!
Okay, let me just change.
Oh, I'm sorry, were you speaking to me or sleeping with someone else?
Oh I know, my God, this is so-this rice is so-I am so good.
Yeah, what're you saying, you just sort of put away feelings or whatever the hell it was you felt for me?
Oh!!
Hey Pheebs, can I talk to you over here for a second?
Small...
Really?
Oh, thanks.
Alright, alright, so I'm not a great typist...
Okay please, you're kidding right?! I wrote that one as a joke for you!
I know isn't it? It's like I'm right there with Joshua.
Come on! They rushed into this thing so fast it's ridiculous! I mean, they're gonna be engaged for like what? A year? And somewhere along the way, one of them is gonna realise what they've done and they're call the whole thing off. I'm telling ya, you're gonna be dancing at my wedding before you're dancing at there's.
Well this has story behind it! I mean they had to ship it all the way from the White Plains store.
Sure? Thanks.
Oh, sure! Do you need me to train somebody new?
Oh! I do not have chubby ankles!
You don't even know!
And remember how I said I was going to keep it in my purse so that if it rang I could just pick it up?
Maybe it, maybe it doesn't have to be this tough. I mean, maybe you were on the right track with this whole, you know, spontaneous thing. I mean, women really like that.
Ross! I just had a conversation with her, and she said that she and Joey made a deal!
Wow! Would I have seen you in anything?
Oh, look at me, look at me. Oh, I'm on a date with a really great guy, all I can think about is Ross and his cat and his... Julie. I just want to get over him. gosh, why can't I do that?
Oh, I would love to!
I don't know. The left one.
Okay honey, you can finish this later we're gonna be late. We gotta go.
Okay. Hey, what are you thinking? What are you thinking right now?
Okay.
Honey I swear it we just kissed.
No! Come on! Don't make me go long. Use me. They never cover me.
Oo, I can't watch this, it's like Sophie's Choice.
What?
So Chandler, have you heard about Monica's secret boyfriend?
Oh, hi!
Good different?
Ohhhhhhhh God.
Ross, you got that for free from the museum gift shop.
Yeah, yeah, I know.
Then, no.
Anastassakis/Papasifakis wedding, excellent! {It's a good thing Jennifer Aniston is Greek, because she had to pronounce those names. Luckily for me, they were written on a sign.} Congratulations. Mazel Tov! Hi! Oh, great hat. Listen umm, I need you to perform another wedding. Can you do that?
Really?
Okay, Pheebs, can I ask? So, hes going out with her. I mean, is it really so terrible?
Seriously, your dad doesn't like pranks.
Oh yeah, they're really great! Aren't they?
I'll help you throw out your purse.
Oh yeah well, you know me, babies, responsibilities, ahhh!!!
Ohh, OK, OK, OK, well, basically, lately, I've uh, I've uh, sort of had feelings for you.
Okay.
What?
Because a car backfired?
Well, y'know, a little of this, a little of that. Got myself a date tomorrow night.
Oh, alright. The weirdest place would have to be... ... oh, the foot of the bed.
Who gave you that hickey?
Really?
Oh, oh, I love that Japanese place.
Hey Ross! Any word on the apartment yet?
I know!
D'oh!! I've got it!
No. Well, yeah, maybe.
Okay, go to the left. The left!
What?!
You're right, I don't have to apologize. Sorry. Damnit!
I know, me neither! I mean, you had a sketch!
Hello!
I don't know. I don't know... I thought about it all the way there, and I thought about it all the way back... and, uh, oh, you guys, y'know, it's Ross. Y'know what I mean? I mean, it's Ross.
You do?
Uh-huh.
Oh, my, God, c'mon, you guys! He's gonna be home any minute! He's gonna kill me!
Yeah, we could. Oh hey look! There's some Kappa Kappa Deltas! I was a Kappa. Hey sisters! Wow, we really are bitches.
What was that?
Y'know what? That's a lot to remember, can't I just tell her you're a pig?
When she sees that you're gone, she's gonna know that I let you out, and that I was in here, and I'm gonna get fired!
Well then uh, we better make this night count. Oh wait, I forgot to turn off the cappucino machine. Anchors away. Oh no no, my purse, my purse, my purse, my purse, my purse, my pu rse. Oh, you know what. I forgot to turn off the bathroom light.
I meant er, young, young, I meant young, young to be a doctor. Oh good, Rach.
I'd need an expense account.
Me neither.
Some uh, some visual aides.
It's Joshua.
Thanks!
: We have apple cinnamon...
High-five, the babies are coming!
Well...
Oh my God! Oh, I cannot believe it!
Well, maybe that's my decision. Well, maybe I don't need your money. Wait!! Wait, I said maybe!!
Ohh, not compared to you.
Well, then, I guess that's the difference between us. See, I'd never make a list.
None for me.
I'm just visiting my good friend Carol.
Are they in love?
OK, well, bye.
Yeah but, you don't, you don't, you don't want to try to much too fast. Y'know? I mean, you do remember what happened to the little girl that tried to much too fast don't you?
I bet he sensed that I was ready to have sex with another guy.
Yes, you did.
Well yeah, I do, but I decided to take a long lunch and spend some time with my friend Monica. Y'know I-I feel that we don't talk anymore. How are you? What is new with you?
Okay.
Closer than here?
Phoebe, come on that's silly.
Ohhh!!!!
What?
Okay. Umm, what should we do for the theme?
Oh! Ow!
Y'know, you should never be allowed to talk to people!
Oh my God! What does that thing do?
This place is amazing.
Wow that's uh, juicy. Umm, y'know what though Mon, I actually do have a lot of work to do so if-if-are you sure there's just not anything else?
Hello, excuse me.
OK, I'm guessing this is from...
"Indeed there isn't"... I should really get back to work.
Oh god. I think I'm gonna be sick.
Oh, y'know, it's just like hats, and a shirt, and CD's, just sort of stuff that you've left here.
God. You seem really, really nice.
And I also brought my friend Joey...
No.
That's it. Ow!!!
There it is.
Relaxi-Taxi!
Well, but Pheebs.
What? What's what you were afraid of?
Okay. Oh wait! Umm, did you send those contracts to Milan?
Well, you're lucky you never met that bitch Sharon Majesky. Anyway, umm... The rest of you life, y'know? Any regrets?
Y'know what? No. It's not over until someone says, "I do."
Oh thank you, Chandler, this is so great, she's gonna love me.
Ross, that girl just spent the entire evening talking to your friends, asking to hear stories about you, looking through Monica's photo albums, I mean you don't do that if you're just in it for two weeks.
Huh.
Ohhhhhh, look it's the roller blades.
Man in the black dress... Hi! I'm Rachel! I'm a friend of Monica and Chandler's!
Oh my God. Can you imagine if there was?! I mean, what would happen exactly.
Hey!
So c'mon, you guys, tell me all the dirt!
What-Pheebs?! Two dates in one day? That's so unlike you.
No.
Oh... Oh, Pheebs.
Monica, what did you mean before when you said you didn't want to talk to anyone, especially me?
I mean do you have any fun, you know, fantasy type things?
All right, well, you're right, these are the best oatmeal cookies I've ever had.
Oh no-no-no, no-no-no, that's not what I meant.
Aw, thanks!
Wait, what do you mean you're getting a new brain?
Oh, all right. But y'know I gotta say, I don't, I don't think six years counts as an era.
Hi!
Monica's making jam.
How did we end up with these jerks? We're good people!
I know.
Oh hi! Y'know, I just wanted to see if there were any leads on the old job front.
Do you want to put the book in the freezer?
Umm, okay. But while you dial, let me show you the features of my new ringing handbag. Oh, it does work!
Hey Mon, little question for ya! How do you think this suit will look on an assistant buyer?
You want me to just call him up and tell him that you're seeing him instead? That's what you want?
Hey, hubby!
Great! Monica's moving!
Okay, here we go...
Ohh.
Huh.
Hi Russ, I've just got two more tables to clean and then we'll go, OK?
Ahhhhh, salmon skin roll.
Okay!
Ok, while you "mmm" on it for awhile, I'm gonna go find a place for my new lamp.
Go on! Go on.
O-kay!! See what you did, I'm gonna be doing it by myself now. Okay?
Hi.
What? C'mon, talk to me.
I cannot believe Ross is buying this!
You really, really need to get some sleep, honey.
Monica, Monica, look at this lamp. Is this tacky or what? We have to have this.
Oh, hi!
Yeah.
I don't think so.
You guys, there's a little girl in Soho looking for this cat. I mean, you know what that means?!
What?
Hi! I just wanna--Ahhh!!! Oh my God! Oh my God!
Yeah?
Hey! Out of all of us, who do you think is gonna get married next?
Yeah! Closure. That's what it is, that's what I need. God, you're brilliant! Why didn't I think of that? How do I get that?
Ohh, gee. I wonder why she thinks you're going to call her?
I give up you guys, I don't know what I'm going to do with this thing!
Isn't that a line from the show?!
Are you sure?
That's great!
Daddy, daddy, you know what, I really wanna hear more about this, I really do, but I just have, I just have to do a, some stuff.
Ohhhh!! ...What? What?
You're a pathetic loser, right?
Wiper blades. I don't even have a car.
OK, ready when you are.
I can't believe Mark didn't call. It's Sunday night, and he didn't call.
Oh yeah, now everybody wants to be under this hat!
Well, I-I know you can do that too. I'm just, I'm just saying if you need somebody to talk to... Hi!
You...are...not going to believe it! Joshua came into work today, and guess what happened?
Noo, I y'know I don't see why she has to play with you, that's all. I mean doesn't she have any y'know other stripper moms friends of her own?
Hey.
I'm- uh- I'm okay... You look great!
Kind of ditzy? Too into her looks? Spoiled?
Well, it was all Ross's idea.
Here he is. Hi. Guys, this is Russ.
Well that was depressing, I think I just bought a soft pretzel from one of the kids from Fame. Ready to go to the movies?
So, like, you guys all have jobs?
He didn't turn me down! He's at the game isn't he? I got the date, I'm just not on it!
Ross, honey, is there anything we can do?
Well okay, how about four hours in a freezing museum auditorium listening to Professor Pitstains and he's 'Hey everybody! Remember that thing that's been dead for a gazillion years. Well there's this little bone we didn't know it had!'
Phoebe. We would like to talk to you for a second.
What?
Ohhh! That is soo sweet!
Good luck, honey!
Oh God. No! Oh not again! This-this happened when my grandfather died. It's ugh! Sorry. Oh, okay, so I'm sorry, what-what were you-what did you want to tell me?
Cool... "Urkel" in Spanish is "Urkel."
Wh... So... If neither of you are married by the time you're 40, you're gonna marry Joey.
What?! You kissed!
Okay.
Why would a charity give away a free boat?!
Hi!
Oh, please tell me it's not because I'm going with Mark.
Y'know, I gotta tell ya, this really does put in a better mood.
Yeah?
Oh my God! You are giving this a lot of thought.
Hey!
It's not a purse! It's a shoulder bag.
Joey, had reasons.
Wow!!
I don't know! I mean, we still care about each other. There's a history there. 'S'like you and Carol.
What?! I didn't have a good time in Greece! Ross abandoned me! Okay, I couldn't get a plane out, so I had to stay in their honeymoon suite with people coming up to me all the time going, "Oh, Mrs. Geller, why are you crying?" I mean, it was sooo humiliating. I felt like such an idiot! I mean, it's all my fault! And you know why, because I make very bad decisions.
I mean, y'know I'm just gonna have to accept it ...
Well, it would be easier to move just right across the hall. Wait a minute, unless you're thinking about Naked Wednesday's.
You don't tell a guy that you're looking for a serious relationship! You don't tell the guy that! Now you scared him away!
Really?!
Hi.
Oh they're in the top drawer. Hurry.
Hi! Okay, don't be mad at me, but I couldn't resist.
See Pheebs, I promised you no one would die, didn't I?
All right listen umm, I just bought something I'm not sure she's gonna like it, and it's gonna seem a little crazy, but this is something that I wanted since I was a little girl.
Yeah but, maybe it's not what we think. Maybe it's tell Monica I'm sorry I...drank the last of the milk.
No, Phoebs. I'm dating Russ.
Yes, yes it is true. And I know this because, because he pretended to be Drake to, to sleep with me.
Okay, y'know, would you feel better if we went someplace else? I mean we could pack all this stuff up and y'know go to your apartment.
On someone's lips? Where'd you get the hickey?
Don't!! Honey, what are you doing here?!
Hey!
Really?!
Oh, I can't watch this.
Oh my God.
Maybe it was just the kind of story where you have to be there.
Okay, very cute braces. Anyway y'know what, the point is Tag, start looking because you are going to find those contracts on your desk.
Ooh, I was soo nervous about that letter. But the way you owned up to everything, it just showed me how much you've grown. Y'know?
Apartment pants?
It was like months ago. We were walking by this antique store, and I saw this pin in the window, and I told him that it was just like one my grandmother had when I was a little girl. Oh! I can't believe he remembered!
Ohhhh!
God I'm just a horrible person.
I dunno. Y'know to me he'll always be "Jack Geller, walks in while you're changing."
What are you talking about Pheebs? I don't... Oh my God, you drew on me?!
So Pheebs, pick one of them.
There, well, see? Barry wouldn't even kiss me on a miniature golf course.
Hi, how was the movie?
Oh, me too.
Thank you.
I don't know. Whatever I was feeling, I'm... not.
Oh as, as opposed to your other multi-functional nipples?
No, no, no, no turtles scare me. I don't need that today.
Yes, Chandler, that's exactly what it is. It's your hair.
Okay.
Oh.
So what are you saying; I should run him under hot water and bang his head against a table?
I think so.
What? Why? Where are you?
Okay.
What are you, what are you doin'?
And you were at this job for four years?
This one is uh Paul O'Neil.
No, you're not an idiot, Ross. You're a guy very much in love.
Wait, I-I just said "leave."
Okay! All right, pick a half.
Ohh. Oh, so you really wanted to learn. Yeah, y'know, Pheebs I just wanted to have fun. Ohh, you know who you should go with?
Hello!
Not unless different means the same.
Well! Is everybody else having just the best time?!
What, what, what?
You see, you look beautiful. For god sakes, dim the lights.
Of course they're listening to you! Everybody listens to you.
Okay, that was Phoebe Buffay, everybody. Woo!
Ross, it's too hard.
Yeah, it'll be fun. We'll run in the park. It'll be like our first y'know roommate bonding thing.
Oh wow.
Hmm. Look, Ross, if you want your neighbors to like you, why don't you just pay the hundred bucks? The party's gonna cost you way more than that.
Barry?
And I hope Barry doesn't kill you and eat you in Aruba.
Oh, no-no-no, no-no-no, it has become, it has-yeah. Oh no, those were four great dates.
Wait, wait, Chandler, this is what you're havin' for Thanksgiving dinner? What, what, what is it with you and this holiday?
Look! I cleaned! I did the windows, I did the floors... I even used all the attachments on the vacuum, except that little round one with the bristles, I don't know what that's for.
Hi. Sorry, things aren't working out so well.
Oh my God! That's so great! I'm so happy for you guys!
Thank you, Okay, Okay.
Oh, Monica. You are not still going over that thing.
All right, y'know what? I-I'm sorry. I will try to tone it down and uh stop yelling.
Ohhh, OK.
Well, have fun!
Hey.
Yes.
Maybe. I-I don't know-Oh God, how could I be so stupid?!
No, you're right. Well, we'll find something. Let's just get you out of that. Come on.
Yeah! You and that girl from that copy place, which yesterday you took full responsibility for!!
Oh, y'know what? That was a complete misunderstanding!
Really?!
OK, OK. I'm with you, Cheech. OK.
Well, believe me, it's been a long time since I've been flung.
Oh, I called them. And when they ask me what I saw, I can be very generous or very stingy.
Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated?
How is you drinking helping the kids?
Ohhhh, sorry I missed that.
Ohh... I mean two best friends falling in love, how often does that happen?
You may need to use this year to teach Ben about Phoebe.
Okay. Happy birthday Grandma! It's better to be over the hill then buried under it. All our love Monica and Chandler. That's funny, yeah!
OK Julie, so now let's start with your childhood, what was that like?
Oh, God...
I am? Oh, look at that, yes I am. Enough about me, enough about me, Mr. Back from the Orient. Come on. I wanna hear everything! Everything.
Ohh! I would kill for a salmon skin roll right now!
I'm not vanilla! I've done lots of crazy things! I mean I got-I got drunk and married in Vegas!
Yeah, why is it so hard for you to believe?!
Yeah, but it's okay, because when Ross left Mark came over.
Both of you?
Ohh! It's so nice to meet you. Hello.
Yeah.
Hey! Oh right, tonight was your party.
Oh..Go..Oh..and I told my boss that someone made out with Ralph Lauren. If she finds out that I lied to her, she is going to hate me even more. Phoebe!!
Op, ice. I need ice.
Yeah, I'm fine.
Oh gosh, she's going to kill me.
Hmmm... this is so nice.
Yeah, I said what was okay when I thought she was some weird bald chick. I mean, y'know, that girl has hair got all over head!
Hi!
Oh. Well then, you better go take that back because they're gonna charge you for that.
No that could kill her.
Ow! Ow! Ow!
What-what-what are you gonna do?
Yeah fun? Great! So uh, so did you guys hit it off?
Ohh. Ooh!
Does it?
I don't know!
Oh, hey, don't you have to go pick up Emily?
What?
Hi.
Do you?
Allll done!
Ooh, I like those sunglasses.
What?
All right.
Yeah. Who's workin' for you babe?
I use my breasts to get other people's attention.
Uhh.... waitressing?
Yeah! That would be great!
Oh hi!
Oh, okay, we're going. Yeah.
Yeah, at the lecture, I told you that last week, you said you didn't mind.
I will not! I'm the divisional head of men's sportswear!
Well yeah, sure, what's up?
Huh, well maybe it uh, it changed.
Are you over me?
Uh-huh.
Oh my God! Oh my God, look at these pelts!
Okay, remember uh, remember how you told me that your grandmother put up that wall to make that into two bedrooms?
Absolutely.
Hey-hey, you guys oh hurry up, get some, there's a whole cart outside...
No! Come on its late, we're not gonna go down to the office.
Sure.
And heels.
Monica? Monica!
Oh my God!
No, of course, of course I've heard of them! Ross, what did you get?
What?
Well, sure! Come in! Well, what-what happened to your girlfriend?
Oh, Ross...
Ross, that was a Halloween costume, unless you would like me to go to this thing as Little Bo Peep.
Ross? Look, whatever this relationship stuff that Emily wants, just give it to her. Come on, the bottom line here is that you love her. So just fix whatever she wants fixed. Just do it. I mean, you're gonna have to try. You'll just gonna hate yourself if you don't. Oh come on answer it! It's driving me crazy!
Oh no wait Pheebs, I think for something like that you just ask them to move in with you. But I'm not sure, Chandler?
All right, fine.
Hey Joey, how'd the audition go?
Nope. We took her to lunch.
Umm, okay, I think I'm-I'm just gonna-just gonna say it. Just gonna say it. Uhh, I'm still in love with you Ross.
Y'know you're-you're probably wondering about the old date on there.
Well, I do, but you're just gonna have to actually look at this as more of an investment than a cat.
Okay-okay-okay-okay-okay-okay-okay! I got it! I got it! I got it! I can't! I can't! I can't! I cannot go with you and my sister thing. Okay? I just can't. It's just too weird, all right? I imagine the two of you together and I freak out. It freaks me out. I can't do it! I can't do it.
All right are you guys gonna come down?
Well, well, well, hop back in bucko, cause I got four sixes! I won! I actually won! Oh my God! Y'know what? I think I'm gonna make a little Ross pile. I think that one was Ross's, and I thinkohthat one was Ross's. Yes! : Well, I have got your money, and you'll never see it...
Oh God... well, it started about a half hour before the wedding. I was in the room where we were keeping all the presents, and I was looking at this gravy boat. This really gorgeous Lamauge gravy boat. When all of a sudden- Sweet 'n' Lo?- I realized that I was more turned on by this gravy boat than by Barry! And then I got really freaked out, and that's when it hit me: how much Barry looks like Mr. Potato Head. Y'know, I mean, I always knew looked familiar, but... Anyway, I just had to get out of there, and I started wondering 'Why am I doing this, and who am I doing this for?'. So anyway I just didn't know where to go, and I know that you and I have kinda drifted apart, but you're the only person I knew who lived here in the city.
Okay.
All right, look, here's the bottom line Ross, this is fixable, if we act fast, okay. So, I'll invite him to brunch tomorrow and you can make nice.
What?! Joey got a turkey stuck on his head?!
OK, OK, it's my turn.
No, no-no-no. Phoebe, this was my fault and besides y'know what? I'm fine here.
Aww, Joey, come here. Look honey, I know this must be really, really difficult for you and I--Oh, I'm sorry. Am I hurting you?
Okay, you gotta give me some of your piece.
Wow. Well, I guess it was Cupid who brought her here.
Hey.
It'll be a short one.
But y'know umm, Rachel doesn't rhyme with draddle.
Good. Although y'know, he-he's a private guy. Y'know, I wish I could get him to open up a little bit, share some feelings.
Honey, y'know I just gotta tell you, I think this is such a terrific thing you're having these babies for Frank and Alice.
Mon. Hi!
Okay, hold on just a second. I'm sorry, it's for human resources, everybody has to do it. Could you just stand up please?
Umm, well let's see Monica and Chandler are occupied.
Oh, I'm sorry. Ross Tillman.
No, we didn't get married! That's ridiculous!
Well what is it? Let me see.
Yeah, umm, no honey.
Ya, know what Barr, I'm not gonna leave. I probably should, but I'm not, see 'cause I promised myself that I would make it through at least *one* of your weddings . See now, tonight, all I really wanted was to make it though this evening with a little bit of grace and dignity. Well , I guess we can all agree that's not gonna happen. There's nothing really left to say except.... "Her name was Lola. She was a showgirl. With yellow feathers , feathers in her hair, and a dress cut down to there. She would..."
Yes, you have to get her something, and it should be something really nice.
Oh my God.
Hi!
I believe you. So, it was right in the middle of a staff meeting so of course no one else wants to correct her so everyone else is calling me Raquel! By the end of the day, the mailroom guys were calling me Rocky!
Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight with you Ross! Look, urrgh, maybe we should take a break.
Charming.
With Ross and Jill?
All right, let's do it.
Oh my God! Did you get to see anything good?
Oh my God! That's Monica!!
I do the same thing.
No! It didn't! That's what I want to talk to you about. Now, just to brief you... I may cry, but they are not tears of sadness or of anger, but just of me having this discussion with you.
So Mon, when are we gonna meet this new secret waiter man?
Honey, why is it hard, I mean we've been together for almost a year now?
Well there's yore. And uh, y'know, yesteryear.
Ohh, it's Joshua invited me to this fancy club opening tonight. But, I already told Mr. Waltham that I would take his niece to this dumb old opera. So... What are you gonna do?
I know, I just didn't want to wear my glasses on my first date.
Men are unbelievable.
Joey! Joey, good one!
Noooo, no, I'm not mad at him. I'm.. I'm not really anything at him anymore.
Oh right, 'cause you always pull your pants down at the count of three and play Wipe-out on your butt cheeks.
Yeah.
Me? I'm great! I'm fine! I'm sooo good!! But, you know who's not great?! Men! You're a man right Ross?!
Oh.
Um... unless, unless I use yours.
No, y'know what? Maybe somebody came in here and fixed it! Or something!
Hey, do you guys have... ...hi.
Wait, so, you're going?
It's not a baby! It's a cat!
Time's up, now your dead.
Oh, I wanna quit, but then I think I should stick it out, then I think why would such a person stay in such a demeaning job, just because it's remotely related to the field they're interested in.
I knew it! I knew it, ahh....
Oh, it's so easy for you I mean, you're not married, you get to have sex with who ever you want!
I'm sorry, Rosita? As in...
I mean if you think about it, I mean Ross did learn something from each marriage.
Oh they are nice. We-we custom-make tuxedos for celebrities and then when they're done with them they just send 'em back.
Op, but the twelfth brings a lover's spat.
Yeah! Especially not with all of these knives and cookbooks around...
What's Flimby's?
Mrs., Mrs. Gobb?
Ugh, the worse day! Y'know, you think you're making progress at work and then your boss calls you Raquel.
Oh, yeah, check it. Definitely, I want some of that.
Yeah, when we're in the audience he doesn't talk to us, but he does wave.
I know, yeah, sorry.
Ohhh.
Thank you. Hey-hey umm, uh, is there, is there any such thing as an annulment shower?
Chandler!! You have the best taste in men!
Wh-what?!
Ohh...
Yes, we should. I think we should.
Oh God, Phoebe!
Okay. Okay. All right, you take care of that. And meanwhile, the party is tomorrow and we still don't have a guest list.
Oo! When's her birthday?!
Yes! He has a naked picture of Monica! He takes naked pictures of us! And then he eats chicken and looks at them!
Thank you.
Yeah, this is Tag. Tag, this is Phoebe. Phoebe, can I see you for a second?
Oops sorry, my mistake.
Well what happened at dinner?
Pheebs?
Pheebes, this woman is voluntarily bald.
Hey Joey, what 'cha doing?
Daddy, I just... I can't marry him! I'm sorry. I just don't love him. Well, it matters to me!
Wherever I go. Come on you and me, we'll-we'll start a new group, we're the best ones.
I guess you don't.
Yeah, she's gay.
Cats, how long do they live figuring you don't... y'know, throw 'em under a bus or something?
I accidentally kissed him in the interview, and now he wants me back y'know of course, 'cause "Let's bring the girl back who kisses everybody!"
OK, you're whiney, you are, you're obsessive, you are insecure, you're, you're gutless, you know, you don't ever, you don't just sort of seize the day, you know. You like me for what, a year, you didn't do anything about it. And, uh, oh, you wear too much of that gel in your hair.
Oh please...
So now what have we agreed?
Oh.
I can't talk to you. I can't even look at you right now!
Come on, it's not a big deal! We stayed up all night coming up with a plan so that us dating will not be a problem.
No! God, would you just calm down!
Hey Mon!
Hi you guys.
What'cha gonna' do?
Oh, you're not having fun, are you?
Ohh, I love Joey! Joey lives with a duck!
Ohh-ha-ha!
Okay. Okay honey, he's fine, he's fine, let's just put him down. Come here, Ben. See that's a good boy. How could you do that to him!! Ross trusted me, what is he going to say?!
So, whaddya think George is like?
Yes. Here you go Officer uh, Handsome.
That's not the end.
What is this? Ross, what is this?
I'm not going to sleep with Ralph Lauren. I mean, I could, but I wouldn't.
Just get out! Now!!
Yes-yes, just a few seconds and she'd still be with us-nothing about an assistant buyer?
Run Phoebe run.
No-no-no, that' not Joshua.
Julie.
Ugh, horrible! I did the stupidest, most embarrassing thing!
What do you mean you quit?! You can't quit!
Ah, first, I-I would like to say thank you for agreeing to see me again.
Well that works out good, because I'm not listening.
Hey.
Oh yeah, sure, that too.
Four.
Oooh.
Oh my God!! Do it!! Honey, you've waited long enough!!
Hello. I need to get on the 11 o'clock flight.
Oh, it's just an anti-theft device.
No, you know what, I think you should go.
Ooh great! Very Monica.
Well it's not, honey I'm sorry, I guess I'm just nervous. I mean, it's you, ya know, it's us. I mean, we're crossing that line, sort of a big thing.
Oh man!
What's up?!
Do you have any ice?
Time is money my friend?
Well, you know, honey, I don't think everybody gets Smelly Cat. You know, I mean, if all you've ever actually had are healthy pets, then, whoosh!
Come on Ross! You said you wanted to talk about it, let's talk about it!! How was she?
Okay, I need a, I need a drink!
Take it like a man, Ross!
Oh! What a great way to earn some extra pocket money.
Marcel, this is for you. It's, uh, just, y'know, something to, um, do on the plane.
Why, why not?
Yes.
I'd wait.
Well, if it makes you feel any better, I made a fool out of myself.
No! Forget it! I am not gonna ask Frank to give you one of his kids!!
Yay!
Okay.
I can't believe this is happening.
How could you not tell me that she has hair?
Well, you're not totally paranoid.
32.
But I do not want to have everything decided for me. I spent my whole life like that. It's what I had with Barry, that was one of the reasons I left. I, I like not knowing right now and I'm sorry if that scares you but if you want to be with me you are gonna have to deal with that.
And Mrs.?!
Yeah that's great. But first, wait, talk to me, talk to me. Tell me about your day.
Hi! Sorry- sorry we're late, we, uh, kinda just, y'know, lost track of time.
God, he's good.
Well, y'know what, no, you do not make my decisions because y'know what, you're fired.
Yeah, whoosh!
Joey!
Phoebe, what are you doing?
Get your hands out of there! No!
You love her.
Uh-huh.
Monica, your Sweet Sixteen was like a million years ago.
Maybe you should put it off.
What? Guys, I'm not.
And the fact that you were jeopardising my career never entered your mind?!
Oh, okay, we're going. Yeah.
Here is a book of poetry that I know Monica loves. And-and ohh God this is funny, look, this is a picture of one Halloween where she dressed up as a bride. And look, she made me carry her train, which was weird because I was Wonder Woman. Oh and here's a little purse that I found. Y'know I just thought that maybe they could hold the rings in there.
Oh my God. Oh my God Ross, no, hang up the phone, give me the phone Ross, give me the phone, give me the phone, give me the. . .
I don't know.
Hey!
I can't go to my own prom without a date, I can't, it's too late.
Okay, I'm not just waitressing. I'm.. I, um... I write the specials on the specials board, and, uh... and I, uh... I take the uh dead flowers out of the vase... Oh, and, um, sometimes Artelle lets me put the little chocolate blobbies on the cookies.
You fell asleep?!
That had to hurt!
Is my hook unhooked? These things keep falling down, I can't. . .
Sure.
Phoebe, I bet somebody's missing that badge.
See? I've even called Animal Control!
Thank you. What a bitch.
No! None! I mean, my first night in the city, he mentioned something about asking me out, but nothing ever happened, so I just... : W-well, what else did he say? I mean, does he, like, want to go out with me?
Yes of course, absolutely! You're right. I'm sorry.
What?!
I'm sorry, I was just thinking you're day could still pick up.
I'm just not going.
Huh, yeah I guess we are roommates now.
Hey!
Joey, why would you do that?
OK.
Yeah, I'm doing okay. I'm um...let's talk.
Y'know Ross why don't you put that on your answering machine!
Yeah, I know, I know, I know he does. But I have to tell him how I feel! He deserves to have all the information and then he can make an informed decision.
Surprise...
Not stupid. The very cute, cute, cute doctors asked us out for tomorrow night, and I said "yes."
Come on you guys! What are doing?! I thought we were the patch sisters!
Noooooooo!!
NO but Ross. We are never gonna happen, OK. Accept that.
Bye!
Hey Ross? Umm, I just ran into Caitlin in the hallway and-and uh, you must be getting better at this flirting stuff than I thought.
Oh, slides. So really nothing happened.
4 o'clock. Food?
What?! The duck?! What the hell did the damn duck do now?!
No-no-no! This chair's not going anywhere.
Hey.
Okay, well can't you just try it one more time Ross? For me? For me?
Hi Daddy.
Ok, Chandler, Mon, there's only one bananna nut muffin left.
Uh, Pheebs? Who's George Snuffalopagus?
I'm so sorry! No I'm sorry! No I'm sorry! No I'm sorry!
What?!
I did but she doesn't think anyone would be stupid enough to confuse Kenny the copy guy with Ralph Lauren.
Now wait a minute. You just took all the words!
I mean, do you think there are people who go through life never having that kind of...
No, but they stuck me in personal shopping. Which is just a huge step down!
No, I haven't had a chance to be alone with him yet.
Luisa? Oh my God! Monica! It's Luisa!
Yeah?
What? You just click when they click.
Y'know I can't believe I even thought about getting back together again! We are so over!!
Rossy, Rossy.
Uh, honey, yeah that was with Carol.
That's easy for you to say, you weren't almost just killed.
Be-because I didn't want him to think I was stupid! I mean, that was really embarrassing what happened to you!
Oh-okay, but Pheebs?
Is that the heartbeat?
Ross! Phoebe's gonna be here any second, she cannot see this!
Honey, you got a little thing on your...
Well, because she loves you and because you love her.
No....
I had one.
That wouldn't help me.
Great!
Okay, come on-Joey, I'll buy you a new one! All right? We'll go down to the store right now and we'll-we'll get you a new chair.
Oh, I am sorry...
Oh wow! Look at this place!
Get off.
...Monica.
Well, so, why don't you just turn it off?
No. No, you can't.
Okay, y'know what? Maybe I should go!
Come on Phoebe, look at that! They are not breaking up, look at them. Okay that's, you know what that is? That is a, that is a second date, that's what that is! Look at that, she just put her hand on his thigh...
No, it's been three nights in a row.
Hey.
Oh! I remember laughing! I laughed a lot.
Even when we were having sex in that chair?
Yeah, yeah, I was just about to take a break anyways, so...
Oh, you are a petty man. You are a petty, petty....
Grammy, Best New Artist.
Ohh, of course Monica's brother!
Oh, it's so late for 'Shall we'...
What? Oh my God! I'm gonna miss you so much!
Hey, Monica!
Oh, little 'X's! Great! That makes up for everything!
God, oh God Monica, I forgot. This is our first date.
Really? Okay. Okay, I-I'll go upstairs. If-if you get me something from the car.
What?!
Oh my God! Joey Tribbiani from Days of Our Lives, just walked in here!
Oh, what a load of crap. That is a dot. Your mother is up in heaven going, 'Where the hell is my lily, you wuss?' OK, Phoebe, that is not a tattoo, this is a tattoo.
Honey, that's you're name.
Ohh! Me too!
Only 'cause you took up half the circle.
Okay, you just go on and make your little jokey-jokes, but if you do not know what you are doing out at sea you will die at sea. Am I getting through to you sailor?!
Absolutely! Absolutely!
Now, now the one in the feather boa, that's Dr. Francis. Now, she used to be a man. Okay, now look, see, there's Raven. We hate her. We're glad she's dying. Okay- Wh- wh- Marcel, are you playing with Monica's shoes? You know you're not supposed to pl- whoah. Marcel, did you poo in the shoe? Marcel, bad monkey! Oh! Oh! Sorry, Barry. Little engagement gift. I'm sure you didn't register for that. Who died? Who died? Roll him over! Oh, c'mon, roll him over! Oh...! Well, we know it wasn't Dexter, right Marcel? Because- Marcel? Marc-
We're gonna find love!
Oh Daddy, no he didn't mean anything by that, he really didn't.
I-I don't want your job. I-I don't. Ohh this is such a mistake. I did not make out with him. Nobody made out with him. I did not use my keycard yesterday. I don't even know how to use my keycard.
Okay.
Wait, we still have time to talk and they're-they're not even in the car yet! Oh look, there they go, okay.
Okay, walk us through it, honey, walk us through it.
Maybe Joey's right. Maybe all good deeds are selfish.
Together?
Okay.
But! Don't you have to give him his money back?
Well what?! How-how much is it?!
You know what, I'm gonna do that, I'm gonna call him up, and I'm gonna ask him out. I can do that. Ask him out. How you doin'? Hi! Joshua? It's Rachel Green from Bloomingdale's. Yeah, umm, I was wondering if you umm, if you umm, left your wallet at the store today? Well, we found a wallet, and we- the license? Well, that is a good idea! Uh, well, let's see here this says this license belongs to a uh, uh, belongs to a mister uh, Pheebs, and umm, yeah, so sorry to bother you at home. I'll see you tomorrow. Bye. You've done that a thousand times?
Chandler gets it! It's Chandler Bing!
He-he said Rachel, right? Do you think I should go up there?
Y'know, I'm still 29 in Guam.
Oh that.
The bll is drrbing!
Well those are very popular frames.
Yeah, and not a very good one.
Oh. Oh! I can do it!
I don't care! I don't care! You are going to have to take her out again and end it, and end it in way that she knows it's actually ended. And, I don't care how hard it is for you, do not tell her that you will call her again!
Well, I-I guess-I...
Can I please be there when you tell her?
Just a waitress?
Oh, yeah.
Oh my God this is sooo humiliating. I think the only thing that tops that was, was, was when I was in the eight grade and I had to sing the Copa Cabana in front of the entire school. I think I got about two lines into it before I ran and freaked out. Oh my God, my entire life is flashing before my eyes.
Don't you have a laundry room in your building?
I didn't know then. And how come you never said anything to me.
Um-hmm.
Barry was the guy that I was almost married and Mindy was my best friend.
Ohh, okay. Wh-Ah-ha! Wait a minute. Uh Ben, I can't do it.
Well, from me. And I know it's not your big money song, but it's my favorite.
So ah, did you have fun at the bachelor party last night?
Where did you get that?
Yeah, well, word of advice: Bring back the comedian. Otherwise next time you're gonna find yourself sitting at home, listening to that album alone.
Mon?
God, I'm not lame, okay. I can do something. I can throw, would you let me throw, come on this is my game too.
Yes!
Oh, you-you mean your earrings?
Yeah! I got my girls.
Yeah, what's it about?
Get up!
Okay. Uh, well can we, can we get you anything Mr. Zelner? Maybe some chocolates?
OK, OK, that is my favorite sweater, that is my third date sweater.
December 26th, huh maybe she's Santa Clause.
Oh.
No, he told me. He prefers to leave certain things to the imagination.
I don't know, it was you and a bunch of albino kids.
Alright you guys, I'm takin' off my shirt.
No, I did, but tell me again, because it's so romantic.
Yeah but-but-but you liked me! Oh my God, I can't believe this, all this time, I liked you and you liked me!
Oh!! My God, what are you doing here?
Well, yeah, right, y'know what? Yeah, you're right, I mean, we no, we have our fun. Yeah! But if ......I mean, I mean like craaaazy! Y'know? Okay, all right. This is gonna, this is gonna sound y'know, a little umm, hasty, but uh, just go with it. Umm. Ugh. What if we got married?
Yeah Phoebe, I completely understand.
Well, sure, but they might think it's kinda weird considering I don't work there anymore.
I'll figure something out.
No, it was just the three of us.
Oh, hi.
Really?
Now, does it really matter?
How do you think this suit would look on an assistant buyer at Bloomingdale's?
Okay, no, that's not the right decision. That's not, that's not right, no Ross-Ross, come on! I mean, that woman made you miserable! Okay, Ross, do you really want to get back into that?
He just kept asking, and asking, and asking, and asking, and asking, and asking.
Well, people missed you in there. And in fact, there was actually a request for "Smelly Cat".
Mon. I wish I could, but I've made plans to walk around.
When I was um, 7, I crashed my bike right out in front of his house and to stop me from crying he kissed me right here.
Wait a minute! Wait a minute! I'm not saying that you shouldn't have a bag, I just-it's just there are other bags that are a little less umm, controversial.
Hey.
No, you have it, really, I don't want it-
All right, look. Why don't you just return the book, let Joey give her the clock pen, and you give her something worse than that. Like... a regular pen.
Alright, I got it Ross.
Yeah. That's Daddy.
No, I think I'm gonna catch up on my correspondence.
I really think you need to go now.
Hey-whoa-whoa-whoa!! Ho-ho-hold on a sec there, Mr. Kissey! Y'know, I've been meaning to talk to you about this whole, little, new European thing you got going on, and I just need to tell you that it makes me very uncomfortable and I just-y'know-stop it!
Hi!
...And so then I realised. All this stuff I had been doing. proposing to Joshua, lying to Ross about why I couldn't come to the wedding. Was all just a way of...
I don't know.
I ah, will buy and wrap all of your Christmas gifts.
Yeah.
You're gonna be late! Go! Go!
Phoebe!! Phoebe!! It's okay!! It's okay!!
Yeah, don't push it though.
Oh, that's um, interesting.
What are you doing?! Get in the front!
Oh my God! My dog died!
What?!
Oh, I have to go tell Monica what a wonderful brother she has!
Oh god.
Yeah.
Let's roll!
What?
Well, I, umm...
Ross, I watched you get hypnotised in Atlantic City.
Remember when we were in high school together?
Hey, come on now!
What?
Yes, I realize that...
Hi!
Oh.
Honey, no one thinks you're a pansy, but we do think you need a tissue.
Oh... that's too bad. Bye bye.
Oh good. Ahhh! My God, sorry!
I am so proud of Joey, I can't believe he's going to be on Law & Order!
I'm unpacking!
Huh-hoo, yeah, no, it's still basil.
Hey, how's...how's the uh, miracle chair?
Yeah, all right. All right! Just keep walkin'! All right?
Ohh!
Yeah.
Nobody does honey.
Monica!!!
Well-well that's 'cause I went down there and they were all smoking. This is actually the smell of success.
I get to hire my own assistant!
I am so gonna miss watching you freak people out like that!
And umm, vintage handkerchiefs y'know 'cause, people cry at weddings. I'm just gonna grab a couple of these.
Fine.
Oh.
I'm gonna get back to retraining.
Oh no-no-no-no-no, no you don't!
Oh thank you! Oh God! Can I have another one?
We ended up having sex in his chair.
Wow. I, I don't even know what to say. Thank you.
Joey, you have got to take this back!
This is Joey, and Phoebe, and this is Chandler, and you remember Ross.
Okay. Okay. Joey, it's okay. Settle down.
How are you holding up?
Oh what do you know? Virgin!
That's fine!
Yeah, I'm sorry.
And stop saying that! I hate that!
I am still talking!! And then you chase away the one guy that I actually liked! I mean, no offense to you guys. Really! I mean congratulations on all the cash, and-and y'know--Wow! You do have very soft hair! But I would much rather go to the ball all by myself than go through anymore of this! Good-bye! Now do you use some sort of special conditioner on that hair?!
Well, of course I am! It's not gonna happen to Ross! He's your brother. He's your old college roommate. Ugh, it was just a matter of time before someone had to leave the group. I just always assumed Phoebe would be the one to go.
Well it's mine too! What else you got?!
Joey! The wedding is in less than an hour!
Ross.
I mean, it-it was like, it was like he made us into a team.
This is totally your fault!
Phoebe!
Ohh, he's married! Ross is married. I can't-I still can't believe it.
Well...
Okay, you know what? I don't have it, but I can tell you exactly where it is on my night stand, and...okay. But you know what? I have my drivers license and I have a twenty.
Oh-ho!
So Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.
Ooh, Julie's so smart, Julie's so special.
Vogue! Hey, so tell me about this Jane Eyre woman.
Oh my God! It sure didn't look this way when I lived here.
No, I'm just kidding I would never do that to you! Okay, everybody, it's trifle time!
Well I assume the ah, happy couple isn't up yet. Did you guys hear them last night?
I don't care about the little dude! I can't! I cannot listen to anymore of this! Y'know, the only person who would want to listen to this is a mental health professional! And then it's only because they get paid $100 an hour! Do you know how much money I could've made listening to you? $2,000! And do you know when I figured that out? While you were talking!
A birthday party.
And?
Hey guys! What's...
Ross, hi, it's Rachel. I'm just calling to say that um, everything's fine and I'm really happy for you and your cat who, by the way, I think you should name Michael. And, you know, ya see there I'm thinking of names so obviously, I am over you. I am over you and that, my friend, is what they call closure.
What'd you get?
Hi Danny! Wow! Thirsty huh?
Well, I don't get it, but she wanted me to give you her phone number.
Is he romantic with her?
Of course he will! But Chandler the most important thing is you forgive yourself!
Oh! Y'know what? You're right! We meet, you flirted and then bamn nine years later you had me!
So, what, you're just, you're just okay with being flaky?
Then why do you ask?!
Okay.
Oh I'm sorry, we're clo-... Hey sailor.
Really?
Oh how can you possibly know? Look at this mess, Tag! I mean, this is what I'm talking about! You have to be organized! You've got newspapers! You've got magazines! You got-Ohh! And who is this chippy? A little young for you Tag, but whatever.
Yes! Did you see that?
Ross! Your honor, rest assured relationship ended like two years ago! And could you strike "Consummated like bunnies" from the record?
And, I'll be nice.
I can't kiss anyone.
Well you have to because maybe it's stupid.
Oh-oh!
Ross! Stop that!
Yeah, uh you-you probably need that for stamps, right?
I did!! I watched! I watched! I watched Monica bang his head against that thing!
Well y'know, I don't want you to be cold.
No! No-no, no-no-no, very quiet, said with love, no yelling.
Say it!
I'm sorry, I was just reading the joke below it. Man, that one is funny.
Fancy soap? I thought we were savin' that for the Pope!
What?
I'm not! This is what I'm doing now. I've got this job-
Come on Ross give me the keys! Monica does not know what she's talking about! I am an excellent driver!
I cannot push it in!
All right.
Oh my God! How?!
Phoe-be!!
All right, listen, missy. If you want this cart, you're gonna have to take me with it!
Oww!
Okay. Okay.
Joey look, just look at it this way, the sooner Phoebe breaks Chandler the sooner this is all over and out in the open.
Oh, great!
Come on.
Hi! Wh-what are you doing here?
Hey Chandler. Monica just broke my seashell lamp.
Ohhh... I'm fine.
Goodnight.
'Sup?
Uhh, we still need a tip.
Hey, Mon.
Oh my God Phoebe, this is impossible! We can't do this by Friday! We have to find a place. We have to invite people! We have to get food! There's just too much to do! It's impossible! We can't do it! We cannot do it! We cannot do it!
Big night!
You're sister? You're sister's asleep on the couch? Ohhh! I saw her with you on the subway and now she's asleep on the couch!
I mean I'm probably 98% happy, maybe 2% jealous. And I mean what's 2%? That's nothing.
I'm so dead serious. I'm totally serious.
Yes!
Honey, I'm sorry, but he's right. I love you, but you're crazy.
And remember how you always said you were afraid the landlord would find out and then tear it down?
Ok, Ok, Pheebs...
It's so that I can spend Thanksgiving with my family. See, every year we go skiing in Vail, and normally my father pays for my ticket, but I sort of started the whole independence thing, you know, which is actually why I took this job.
"I'm Monica, I don't get phone messages from interesting people. Ever!"
Phoebe! It's 6 o'clock in the morning! Why aren't you at Gary's?
I don't care! I wanna meet this guy who's the best sex she ever had!
Hang in there. You hang in there.
Oh, sorry. I meant Chandler.
Hey.
Well, that shouldn't be a problem. I mean I work in fashion and all I meet are eligible straight men.
Great!
My parents happened. All they had to do was sit in the same stadium, smile proudly, and not talk about the divorce. But nooo, they got into a huge fight in the middle of the commencement address. Bishop Tutu actually had to stop and shush them. But you know what, you know what the good news is? I get to serve coffee for the next 8 hours.
I... Well, I don't think they need any help.
She you in the parking lot.
Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight over and over again, Ross, no, you're, you're, you're making this too hard.
Phoebe you can't have both of them! You have to pick one!
Wow, y'know if Joey and Chandler walked in right now, we could make a fortune!
Who is being loud?
Oh, somebody will.
Well, congratulations, so do you love her?
Music. Very nice.
I'm so happy and not at all jealous.
More than jewelry.
Grape.
Yeah!
Hey, Sophie!
Well y'know, it's you guys. You-you do this kind of stuff! Y'know? I mean, you-you were gonna get married in Vegas and then you backed out! I guess I'm not upset because I don't see you guys going through with it. I'm sorry.
Hi.
I just can't believe this is happening. I mean, when I was little, everybody's parents were getting divorced. I just figured as a grownup I wouldn't have to worry about this.
Well umm, that one is pretty but uh, I just, I just love this fabric Sorry.
Come on, please?! I'm boredddd! You let me do it once before.
Monica, your dad just beeped in, but can you make it quick? Talking to Rome. I'm talking to Rome.
Mr. Treeger.
Well relax, he'll be here.
Joey, I really don't...
Ross, no! There is no way I am leaving this room looking like this!
But we should move quick.
All right, wherever you wanna go is cool.
Ugh! No more crying! Please! I just dumped one cry baby, I'll dump you too!
Ahhhh!
Okay.
Do you even know what a vicar is?
Wait a minute, you're only giving free stuff away to the pretty girls?
Hi. Look um, about what happened earlier...
Because you are my sister and Ross and I have this huge history...
Let me, let me get you some wine!
Ughh!
And if you need anything else, I do not believe we've met. Hi. I'm, uh, Rachel Green. I'm Carol's... ex-husband's... sister's roommate.
Why?
Pete the Weeper? Remember that guy who used to cry every time we had sex. "Was it good for you?"
What am I making him by the way?
So, did you shave your legs?
You want me to just quit my job so that you can feel like you've got a girlfriend?
Ahh, so do you, beautiful.
I'm sorry, what did you just say? Did you just say hi? Oh my God, Ross, Ross, Ben just said 'Hi'.
Well, maybe sometimes I find out things or I hear something and I pass that information on y'know kinda like a public service, it doesn't mean I'm a gossip. I mean, would you call Ted Kopel a gossip?
Yeah, y'know I-I think I'm just gonna hang out in my room.
Ugh, Monica, I know about you and Chandler.
You don't have birds.
Why?! What is it?
Alright, don't tell me, don't tell me! Decaf cappucino for Joey.. Coffee black.. Late.. And an iced tea. I'm getting pretty good at this!
Hi! So I'm out having lunch at Monica's and this guy starts talking to me, and it turns out he works for a buyer at Bloomingdale's and there happens to be an opening in his department. So I gave him my phone number and he's gonna call me this weekend to see if he can get me an interview!
He's soo lucky, if Janice were a guy, she'd be sleeping with somebody else by now.
Did we speak on the phone last night? Did you call me?
Nooo!
Yes.
What did you get her?
No, happy for you!
Ah!
Really?!
Okay, I have to tell you something that I have never admitted during our entire friendship! But, when we were in high school I made out with James Farrell even when I knew that you liked him! Wow, that feels so good to get off my chest! Okay, you go!
He's coming over! He's coming over!
I mean, look-look today you escaped death, y'know? And maybe this is a chance for you to escape getting back together with Emily?
Every day, you are becoming more and more like your mother.
Oh, you're not gonna tell the whole story about how your parents got divorced again are you?
Well, things change.
I'm sorry, you know, maybe I wasn't being clear. Uh, this is our cart.
Excuse me. Hi.
Yeah but, he's not your type.
Unbelievable.
Oh my god, oh, you guys are great.
Yeah, right. Look at you, you're practically giddy.
Oh God, oh God, it's sowed on though.
Ohh, I would love too.
Was that the cake?
He is, isn't he? I don't know, I don't know, I mean maybe it's just being here at the beach together or, I don't know. But it's like something...
Oh, well, that shouldnt be so hard, now that youre dating. "Sweetheart, youre fired, but how bout a quickie before I go to work?"
Umm, hi!
You wanna go in the bedroom? It's a little more comfortable.
Oh yeah, what's it about?
Oh, it's okay.
Coming.
Here's your lemonade.
I wasn't supposed to put beef in the trifle!
DANGER!!!!!
Hey! Hey!
Hey!
It happened! I am telling you it happened!
Yeah! His name is um, Mark something.
Well, I don't know. I called all the people in Monica's phone book and these are the only ones who could show up on 24 hours notice.
Okay well Ross! Stop it please! Wait a minute!
Wow! I can't, I can't feel my hands.
Yes it is.
Y'know what Ross? You're not going anywhere. You're gonna sit right here. I'm gonna make you a cup of tea and we're gonna talk this thing whole out. All right? Hey, Dave!
Well, yeah! I'm still pursuing that.
What?! You-you actually thought that basket was gonna get you the apartment?
You could.... say you're sorry to her mom.
What?
Just washing the windshield.
I think it's sexy.
Because!
Y'know what Chandler, you got yourself into those cuffs, you get yourself out of them.
Oh my God, what happened?
Oh my God! Oh my God! I can't go! I'm gonna be too nervous!
Okay, well, I'm gonna clear out some of these boxes.
Where are you going?
Yes, it bothers me Ross, but y'know if he was a regular at the coffee house, I'd be serving him sneezers.
Uh, I-I had a drink with lunch. Did those cost reports come in?
And that makes you angry because...
I-I-I didn't! I didn't! She thought you were cute.
No because first they arrest the guy and then they try him.
Oh, umm, I was just y'know working out and umm... Oh, that's it.
I don't care! The wires have come loose in your head!
A cyborg?! Isn't that like a robot?!
No, I-I live with Phoebe. I mean you're alone, alone. And I just-it's just not the time for us. I'm sorry.
Well, y'know what, that doesn't matter.
Right.
"Pheebs, can't make it, got a date. Talk to you later. Big Daddy." Big Daddy?
I'll call the super.
It's fine.
Oh yeah, no, what's that?
Yeah.
What?!
Oh Ross, you're so great.
Ok, ok, ok, I will, I will, I, hey, I will clean the apartment for two months.
What?! Me?! What about you and your consummated like bunnies nonsense!
I did.
There he is!
Oh, I gotta get my ticket!
Merrill Lynch?
Oh my God!! Great!
Oh, good for you!
Hi!
Goodnight.
Oh my gosh, wow. Monica. Oh my god. Mom. This is so great.
Why, where are you going?
Well Joey, you'll probably get it. But you should probably your-your gracious loser face. Y'know when like the cameras are on you and you wanna look disappointed but also that your colleague deserved to win. Y'know? So it's sorta like...
You went out with a guy in the Navy?
Yeah, we ended up spending the day together and had such a great time!
Oh, that's OK, it's just the shoulder, it's not my dress.
Hey, do you believe this? Do you believe they are actually getting married?
Ohh, are you setting Ross up with someone? Does she have a wedding dress?
Oh, yeah, well... Yeah, no use wasting this baby, just lyin' around the house.
Really!
Ohhhh, I cannot look at it!
What?! Are you crazy?
Hey!
That cute waiter guy from your restaurant, the one that looks like a non-threatening Ray Liotta?
I know I had it this morning, and I know I had it when I was in the kitchen with...
Hey.
No, no, thats OK. Y'know, I think I'm gonna give it a go.
Yeah, fair enough.
Rachel.
Oh, I....
Oh God Monica hi! Thank God! I just went to your building and you weren't there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are, you are!
Hi you guys!
Oh oh oh, wait! You only got whipped cream in there! Ya gotta take a bite with all the layers!
Thanks!
Me?!
No, absolutely. Y'know like it was umm...
Okay.
Oh, did you not want people to know that?
Boy, you really can't stand to lose, can you? Your whole face is getting red... little veins popping out on your temple...
Oh, well maybe there was a dog lookin' at him.
Yes!!
I'm more than okay, I am really, really happy! Wanna know why?
Hey!
Uh, thank you Phoebe. Umm, well, what struck me most when reading Jane Eyre was uh, how the book was so ahead of its time.
Oh! Thank God!
Well-well, I don't know Ross-really?
Okay. Okay, see? I get the phone.
This is Bonnie? This is Bonnie? You're Bonnie?
Yeah, I know. It's ridiculous! I can't see you either.
Jill this is not about me being jealous of you! This is about you being a brat! Wanting what you can't have!
Meeting Julie.
Hey.
Hi Daddy!
Oh. Oh my God, is that Phoebe?
You will like it!
What are you doing?
Umm, I said I thought you were a good kisser, and uh, and that I like your tiney-tiny touchie.
Yeah! You and that girl from that copy place, which yesterday you took full responsibility for!!
Thank you. I...yeah.
No! Help me!
Y'know, I don't-I don't know. Let me, let me check.
Yes! Hell yes!
Hey.
Hey, y'know what? You're the one who wants to make this big change and move in with Chandler! You should be the one to go! Why should I have to leave?!
Nothing!
Yeah!
No-no! Big bear! Big bear outside! I think I-I-would you-actually, would you go check on that?
Okay Joey, we're luffing a little bit, so could you tighten up the cunningham?
Well, what is the other reason?
Hi.
Oh honey, I'm sorry.
Oh Ross, come on! You just did what you had to do.
Don't just say yes! This isn't a game, Joey you can really get hurt out here. Okay, so do you want to pay attention or do you want to die?!
Do you really not know where I'm going with this? It left! It's one huge room!
Sorry!! I just feel bad about all that sleep you're gonna miss wishing you were with me!
No Paul, I don't know anything about you! Y'know, like-like your childhood! Tell me about your childhood!
Okay, see now I'm scared because I don't actually think you're kidding.
What are you guys doing here?
All right! Y'know what? That's it! You wanna do it?! Let's do it!
What's going on?
Oh good.
Do you want me to quit?
Aww, look at the little thing.
Well, so, are-are you sure that there are three?!
Are any of you guys free tonight? My boss is hosting this charity event for underprivileged kids and the more people I bring, the better I look. So, Monica? Chandler?
Why's that?
Op, op, car! Car!! Ugh!!!
: Really? : Sure, we have scones left! : OK, read them to me.
Wel-wel-well what are we gonna do?
I mean what if this keeps happening? Y'know, they'll-they'll be outside smoking, making all the decisions and I'll just be up in my office breathing my stupid clean air, y'know? And then when the day comes when Kim wants to promote one of us, who do you think she's gonna pick? Me or Smokey Smokerson?
Ugh, she is a slut!
Awww, stop. Come on. Now go shave that head!
Oh, Mon, sure.
Hi! Is my misery amusing to you?
I can not believe he would do that to Mon-Whoa! Joey, do they know that we know?
Pheebs!
Oh, okay, well, I think we should let Phoebe decide, because she's the only who's impartial, and she's so pretty.
Wow! Tell me something Joey--Whoa! I just fell right off the couch there.
Whatever! Okay, I'm not your mother.
What?
Ok, doggie get the- aahhh. Ok go get the sandwich, get the sandwich doggie. Good doggie get the sandwich, get the...ok, Joey, the dog will lick himself but he will not touch your sandwich, what does that say?
Oh, hmm.
You are so just doing this out of spite.
Joey, you're such an amazing actor! How do you know where Dr. Drake Remoray leaves off and Joey Tribbiani begins?
Well, I have to be, I don't really have a choice, I mean, you know, I could look at the bright side, I get two birthday parties and two birthday cakes.
No honey, okay, okay, you wanna know why Ross canceled the date? Because I asked him to.
I'm fine, I'm fine.
Come on Ross! You said you wanted to talk about it, let's talk about it!! How was she?
Oh, good point.
No?
Does anybody need anything?
That's good enough. Right? Okay, well umm, I'm gonna go look at my books!
So uh, what are you guys doing for dinner tonight?

I love working with designers!
Honey, you can say it, Poconos, Poconos, it's like Poc-o-nos
And ya know what, now I've got closure.
No Mon that's not the point. I'm out a thousand dollars, I'm all scratched up, and I'm stuck with this stupid cat that looks like a hand!
What are you saying?
Why not?
Yeah, well, you uh, better make it for three.
Hi!!
Hey, Mom? Having fun?
I think she's checking out your beehive Ross.
Oh, this one's for me!
Pheebs, you go with Monica and try on her green dress. If that doesn't work, you can wear my gray silk one. Oh, gosh, what am I wearing?!
Ok, we never shoulda talked about this.
Oh, I'm sorry. You know what? I cannot have this conversation with you. I mean, god, you just come in here, and drop this bomb on me, before you even tell Daddy. What? What do you want? Do you want my blessing?
Yeah and there's really cute guys there.
Yeah that works.
What?
I'm just kidding too. I'm getting married in December.
O-okay!
I don't wanna hear "Three failed marriages!"
Oh?
Remind me to introduce you to someone!
He's perfect, he's never been better.
Oh, the guys are here.
Yeah, maybe...
Hey, it's not that big a deal, I was just curious.
No, I'm just....
Yeah, it is.
I can't, I gotta go.
I loved the moment when you first saw the giant dog shadow all over the park.
Okay, I heard that.
Who was that?
...we went back the house and we got really silly and we...we made out.
Yeah, Joey kinda disabled it when I moved in.
Okay, stop what you're doing, I need envelope stuffers, I need stamp lickers.....
No.
Go!!
Steve... sleeve!
Oh, okay.
No I wasn't! You were supposed to tell her to come and I was supposed to bring the cake!
Umm, honey, look he just came over to....
Well now what's the rush?
Okay.
Ross, didn't you ah, play soccer in High School? Oh no wait, that's right. You just organized their game schedules on your Commodore 64.
Ohhhhh. That's how it got fixed!
Uh-huh, I get it, smoke, chimney, chimney sweep, very funny, ha-ha.
Ok, ok, ok, moving on, moving on, next question. Ok number 29, have you ever betrayed another goddess for a lightning bearer? Ok, number 30.
Go to the post office! I'm sure her picture's up! ...Okay, Monica, y'know what, honey, you're kinda losing it here! I mean, this is really becoming like a weird obsession thing.
What?! What?!
Chandler! Patrick just uh, ended things with me. Did you or did you not tell him that I was looking for a serious relationship?
Yeah, I mean, you know it, I mean, if it were me I, I, you know, I'd want you to, I don't know, like catch me off guard, you know, with like a really good kiss, you know really, sort of um, soft at first, then maybe um brush the hair away from my face, and look far into my eyes in a way that let's me know that something amazing is about to happen.
A lot.
Terry is a jerk, ok? That's why we're always saying "Terry's a jerk!" That's where that came from.
Everybody...
Said what? Exactly.
Oh yeah? Another night of birdogging the chickas?
You all know? Does Ross know?
Y'know what you should do?
Ross, I have been walking around like this since the plane! I can-you have so crossed a line.
Alright, I feel that this is totally unjustified. She gave me the green light, I did nothing but-. Do you think I can't see you in the TV set?
Exactly.
Well actually thanks, but I think I'm just gonna hang out here tonight. It's been kinda a long day.
Oh, do I?
Ok, I, I hear what you're sayin'. I'm with you. Um, but I, but I'm trying really hard. And I think I'm doing better. I really do. Does anybody need coffee? Oh, look at that.
Barry?!
Oh! Look what happened! {Don't get your hopes up guys, we only get to see her from the back or from the neck up. Its times like these I wish that the networks would broadcast some nudity other than Denis Franz's butt.} Huh, check me out! I'm in my kitchen...naked! I'm picking up an orange. I'm naked! Lighting the candles, naked, and carefully.
Look, this is not that big of a deal! You just don't date Ross! There's a million other guys out there, you just...
What?
Okay, uh, you let me go grocery shopping, and I buy laundry detergent, but it's not the one with the easy-pour spout.
I have so got it. There's gonna be rumours about this, there's no way to stop it. Sophie knows, Monica and Phoebe know.
Yeah, right, he almost danced me right down that...garbage chute.
Phoebe?! Wait a-but-but she just, she said that Joey was her backup.
Well, who wouldn't?!
Not at all inappropriate!
Yeah. Hi Mark!
Bye hon.
Huh?
I think you should definitely go out with this guy.
'Okay. Okay, daddy we'll see you tomorrow night. Okay bye-bye.'
Oh yeah! Of course, I mean, she's gonna get over this, y'know? I mean, so you said my name! Y'know you just said it 'cause you saw me there, if you'd have seen a circus freak, you would've said, "I take thee circus freak." Y'know, it didn't mean anything, it's just a mistake. It didn't mean anything. Right?
So I hear the Ralph Lauren fooled around with someone in the copy room.
Hey!
And?
No! There is.. there is noone else!
Hey!
Oh, okay!
It's my father. He wants to give me a Mercedes convertible.
I've never wanted you more.
Monica, y'know what? The only reason I did that was because your party was so boring!
But, they're across the hall! I mean that's two doors away, it would take them a long time to peck their way back over here.
Ohh, Phoebe, what am I going to do?
What line?
Well, we have gotta find out if he's alive.
Ugh!
You and Ralph?
I'm going commando, too.
What? Monica, they are cute, they are doctors, cute doctors, doctors who are cute!
So umm, what time are you supposed to leave?
All right, I'll see you guys later.
Ross, I said I'm sorry like a million times. What do you want me to do? You want me to break my foot too? Okay, I'm gonna break my foot, right here. Ow!! Oh! Oh my God, oh my God! There, are you happy now?!
Um, ok, uh, oh god, um, when you and uh Ross first started going out, it was really hard for me, um, for many reasons, which I'm not gonna bore you with now, but um, I just, I see how happy he is, you know, and how good you guys are together, and um, Monica's always saying how nice you are, and god I hate it when she's right.
Oh my God! Oh my God!! Ohh, Jessica Lockhart!! In my apartment!! I am such a huge fan! I am such a huge fan!
So what happens next?
Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, this is so stupid! I mean, I gave Barry up, right? I should be happy for them! I am, I'm happy for them.
Joey! Why did we have to rush out of there so fast?!
Okay, you are going to tell her and you're going to tell her now.
OK!
Oh, wait Joey! We fought the Nazis in World War II, not World War I.
Hi!
God, Monica it's on the ceiling.
You're twins?
How did it go with Erin?
Okay.
Oh my God Phoebe! I mean I'm just-Wait a minute. If I'm your maid of honor that means you are Monica's.
In a month?
Yeah, you do.
Okay umm, Ross? I'm-I'm really warm, so I'm going to be taking off my sweater. Now, I'm just letting you know that this is not an invitation to the physical act of love.
Hey!
Yeah-yeah, did-didn't you use to have a pair? They were really round, burgundy, and they made you look kind of umm...
Y'know, you-you also could've used uh, lamps and then followed the light.
No, nothin'.
Hello, Mrs. Chatracus.
Yeah, see ya.
Wow! H-umm! Hi! Yes, uh I'm sorry the models are actually down the hall.
Oh, howd she take it?
Blow it.
Oh. That's so Monica can keep track. That way if one on them is missing, she can be like, 'Where's number 27?!'
Right!
Aside from the fact that you said you had them?
I don't know!
Hey. Oh, poor Pheebs.
Okay, Pheebs, y'know what, let's look at this objectively all right? Ninth grade, right? The obsession starts. All right? The summer after ninth grade he sees me in a two-piece for the first time, his obsession begins to grow. So then...
Yeah and I'm a horrible, horrible person.
He plays for the Yankees. Seriously, ESPN! Just once and a while, have it on in the background. Ooh, this one was Pierce Brosnan!
We're not?!
What?
Ohh, here you are. I was looking for you before. Joshua's gone so you and Emily are free to go.
Arghh!!
Yes, I know! And Joey knows! But Ross doesn't know so you have to stop screaming!!
Hey, did you guys check out those new hand-dryers in the bathroom?
Well, I'm sorry I'm not going to an eye doctor!
Who's this from?
No, the other thing. I really think it's great they work things out.
Oh no, yeah.
Monica, you don't even have a bed, you sleep in a ball on the floor!
Hey, uh, Joey?
Okay, stop-stop! Phoebe?!
Noo.
It's a truffle. It's got all of these layers. First there's a layer of ladyfingers, then a layer of jam, then custard, which I made from scratch, then raspberries, more ladyfingers, then beef sauteed with peas and onions, then a little more custard, and then bananas, and then I just put some whipped cream on top!
Yeah.
Joey, you're gonna have to stop rushing me, you know what? You don't get any dessert.
Hi! You might not remember us, but we are the girls that fogged you.
Okay.
Hey!
Oh, wait yes, but I can't eat too much. Paul is taking me out to dinner tonight, he said he has a big surprise planned.
Thank you.
Monica! Look! Hi! What do ya think?
All right.
All right. We figured you might respond this way, so we have a backup offer.
So. Ross, I've bugged him about this a million times, he's not gonna change.
Ohh, please! Cooking soothes me. Ahh. So, dig in!
Hello?
I got the job!
What?
Cute guys in little shorts? Sure.
Thank you.
Monica, can Phoebe borrow your green dress?
Fine.
Y'know if what I do is so lame, then why did you insist on coming with me this morning? Huh? Was it so I just wouldn't go with Mark?
Oh is it?! Uhh, hello? Yes hi, is Rachel there? Yes she is, just one moment please. It's for me!
Well...
What?!
Okay.
Wh--Why don't I tell you over here?
Good!
Yeah, that'd be great. I'd love it.
I don't know. What do you mean last night? Nothing, nothing uh, happened last night.
Hmm.
Uh, Joey..
I'm off my break now so uh, um here you take this and um, I am gonna go pour these very nice people some coffee. Ok. Oh look at that, I don't have a pot. I don't have a pot. Well, hey, maybe I've got one at home, or in Scarsdale. Hey is that a door?
Okay. Walked right into that one didn't he?
Oh don't even ask!
Yeah that's right you weren't thinking! Y'know what? Let me give you something to think about!
But....
Ohh...
Stop it! I will kill you. I hate the fact that my room is so small.
I need some milk.
Yes!
Yeah, but if you spent it, it would be like shopping!
Well hello! Welcome to Monica's. May I take your coat?
Uhh, hang in there?
Come on! You guys can pee standing up.
Oh, wait! Sorry, Mr. Paul? Mr. Paul?
So?
Monica, last Saturday night, what happened on Walker Texas Ranger?
How have you never been on Oprah?
Interesting.
Hey!
Hi!!
Ohh, thank you for my beautiul earrings, they're perfect. I love you.
Huh. Well, y'know that's actually a really good idea, because that way they'll be closer to the mugs. Y'know what, you should have the other waitresses do that too.
She-she died Jill.
Joey...
Rob Tillman!
And you know which one we should see? The 1996 Tony award winner. Do you happen to know the name of that one?
Agghhh.
Wow, he's cute, Pheebs! But I thought you just started dating that Kindergarten teacher.
I'm so sorry, you guys. I didn't mean to bring you down.
Oh!
Well maybe he's just taking a nap.
Oh, please, Monica. You've always hated my lamp, and then, all of a sudden, it's just magically broken?
Hey!
Huh, that's funny. You look like you're gonna be the...
Mon, if uh you were at lunch alone, how come it cost you uh 53 dollars?
Well yeah, I wish that you would. Well, no it's not in there! How about that drawer?
Really? How good?
That's a good story, Grandpa.
He-he said Rachel, right? Do you think I should go up there?
Ross, Ross, please listen to me. Ross, you are so much better for me than Paolo ever was. I mean you care about me, you're loving, you make me laugh.
Ohhh! Well of course I will watch him! We have fun, don't we Ben?
My God!
Okay.
Hi.
Yeah? Well, you should know. You've bought like a billion of 'em.
What is the emergency?!
Okay, but Pheebs, Pheebs, Jack gave up a cow, I gave up an orthodontist. Okay, I-I-I know, I know I didn't love him-
Hey.
Ross, please, I found the magazines!
It-it did!
Barry who I almost.
Vrrbddy, the bll is drrbing.
Bye house!
Oh, God, he's such a pig,
You were supposed to be in there so I could see your thing!
Ross! What are you... I'm sorry sir. I just, I think he just really likes you.
All right, fine. Um, you were not the only one there. Joey was there too.
Oh, look, wish me luck!
Ohh, well, isn't that just lovely. That's something the two of you will be able to enjoy for a really, really, really, really, really long time.
I know that too.
Ok, I know this is gonna sound really stupid, but I feel that if I can do this, you know, if I can actually do my own laundry, there isn't anything I can't do.
How-how did end up in Vermont with that awful witch?!
Honey, this really is an incredible thing to do for them, but there are things to think about.
Oh my God! Look at this!
Oh my God, Jill!
Virgo?
Huh.. How about 600?
Yes, Joey, I remember, she's annoying, but you know what she's-she's his girlfriend now. I mean what can we do?
Yeah, you bet.
Okay. Umm, well, first I would like to start by apologizing for kissing you and uh, for yelling at you.
What-wh-what so we'll just stay married forever?!
Oh my God. Oh my God Ross, no, hang up the phone, give me the phone Ross, give me the phone, give me the phone, give me the. . .
Ross said my name. Okay? My name. Ross said my name up there that obviously means that he still loves me! Okay, don't believe me, I know I'm right-do you guys want to go downstairs and get a drink?
I cannot believe her.
Nah, uh, uh, uh, uh.
Ross, Chandler wrote something about me on his computer and he won't let me see.
Left.
Well that's his last name.
Monica, I'm your best friend.
Ok, Monica. I just have to know one thing. Did you go with her to Bloomingdale's? Oh! Ok, ok, ok, I just really, uh, I just really need to not be with you right now.
I know. At dusk. That's such a hard time for me.
Okay then!
Oh God I just can not imagine what is gonna happen if Chandler doesn't show up!
Oh, not much. I-I got a job.
Pheebs, this guy has been obsessed with your sister, for God knows how long, okay, you don't just give up something like that.
Nothing! Oh God, we're just so excited that you want to get this apartment!
Yeah! Y'know, ever since I ran out on Barry at the wedding, I have wondered whether I made the right choice. And now I know.
Y'know Marcel?
Thank you.
Ohh, God, I just got so nervous that he would say no.
So, if I wanna have my kid when I'm 35, I don't have to get pregnant until I'm 34. Which gives Prada four years to start making maternity clothes! Oh wait, but I do want to be married for a year before I get pregnant...
Joey no, this is wrong! You have to take it back, okay? You don't want to win an award this way. You're very talented. And someday you're gonna win one of these for real and that one is gonna mean something.
Honey, might I suggest watching a little more ESPN and a little less E!?
No, it's not better. I still don't get to see you.
Okay please tell me that this is just one of your jokes that you do that I don't get.
Ugh! I cannot believe Chip dumped me for that slut Nancy Branson. I am never going out with him again. I don't care how much he begs!
To get you to make out with him!!!
Oh, Phoebe, do I wanna hear this?
Ive never done that.
Oh God, come on you guys, is this really necessary? I mean, I can stop charging anytime I want.
Over here!
It's a, it's a cat!
Pretty well, actually...
What are you? Monica!! Stop it!! Oh my God! Stop it!
I know!
Eh. Beth dies.
Ummmm.... well, actually I'm already done, but I...I kinda got plans.
Well, you might want to tell him it sounds like his wife is gay.
Yeah uh, y'know what uh, let's skip it.
Ross!
"Oh, my, god."
Thank you! You're great!
Well, so what does he do?
Well...
Rosss...
Look, I cannot do this right now, okay, I've got a deadline, would you just go home, I'll talk to you later.
Yeah, I guess. I-I... I mean, do-do you think we're ever gonna have that?
No Mon, you want to put them in concentric circles. I want to do this.
Hey... hi, ladies... uh, can I get you anything? : Did you bring the mail?
You found my book?!
My God!
Okay, you want me to stop at the ATM?
Thank you. So how-how 'bout you, are-are you seeing anybody?
Why didn't you get it?
Hi! Are you ready? We're gonna be late!
Oh please, what do you know! You married a lesbian!
Chandler, there's a guy right over there.
What's up?
Yeah, and also we need more umm, drinks. Hold on a second. Whup, okay. Hello! Vegas? Yeah, we would like some more alcohol, and y'know what else? We would like some more beers. Hello? Ohh, I forgot to dial!
Ugh.
Oh my God! Phoebe look, it's Ross and that girl.
No, she left a message. But it-it kinda got erased. There's just something wrong with your machine.
Are ah, having dinner with my Dad tomorrow night, I hope that's okay.
What? Wait, what?
Actually, what I think you said was, "don't touch that, and get the hell out of my kitchen."
That is the most ridiculous.
Oh my God, Phoebe, Pottery Barn has ripped off the design of our antique!
What? Wait, what?
I mean you definitely should do that.
Oh. That WENUS.
Hmm.
So Pheebs, what is the book about?
You should find out what his hobbies are and then use that to bond with him. Yeah! Like if I would strike up a conversation about say umm, sandwiches. Or uh, or my underwear.
Well, you know that my parents are out of town and Chip was going to come over...
'Cause I don't need your stupid ship.
Ooohhhh!!
Oh Phoebe!
No, there's a party. There's a party. But the power, that is still up for grabs. You follow me?
Ya know, I mean this is supposed to be a joyous occasion. My sister's graduating from college, nobody thought she would. It's a true testament to what a girl from long island would do for a Celica.
Yeah.
Everybody, this is Paolo. Paolo, I want you to meet my friends. This is Monica.
Ahhhh....
Guess who we ran into today?!
Uhh, no, no, it bothered me when he slept with other women.
Like a little girl. I know. I know. I know. This is all my fault; I wanted him to open up. But God, I didn't know that I was gonna unleash this-this weepy, clingy, moist monster!
Ross! Come on! That's all right! Fine--Okay, I have a weird thing about my eye. Can we not talk about it please?
I didn't. I got under him.
Uh-huh.
I'm a waitress.
What?! Wait a minute! No wait a minute! Okay? Look, that night was the one wild thing I have ever done in my entire life, and I'm not gonna let you take that away from me! Okay, so if you don't remember that, maybe you will remember this!
Already? That's pretty bad what you did.
No, no Phoebe no, I was...no. You know what, I was, I was actually just checking to, see, if I could run. And I can!
What?!!
Ross gave it to me.
No. Ross, it, it just seems that y'know it's time we-we y'know, move on. I mean, I mean don't' you think?
Hey Mon? I'm gonna check my messages.
Ross! I think she is trying to make something happen with you to get back at me!
No, we never do that
Yeah, but then you spent Phoebe's entire birthday party talking to my breasts, so then I figured maybe not.
Wow! They really got you guys. Your T.V. The chairs.
I know.
Oh, uh, Joanna I was wondering if I could ask you something. There's an opening for an assistant buyer in Junior Miss...
Oh no, I'm sorry, you look a lot different from the last time I-I saw you.
Hi! All right, let's go shoppin'!!
Well, what'm I gonna do? What'm I gonna do?
Joey, y'know that you could just not throw the sticks up in the air.
Ugh, I knew it! Oh I cannot believe those two!
I'm serious, I really, I think I need just to have some...meaningless, sex y'know, with the next guy that I see.
Thanks.
What?
Well, there's a kiss that he won't forget for a couple of hours, y'know.
Okay.
You had to do it, didn't you? You couldn't just leave it alone.
Okay.
So, if-if I mess this up, there's nothing else for dessert?
Oh, no no no no. Oh no no no no. I have to do this to her?
Hey Pheebs.
Don't say that I have no sentiment! This is a movie stub from our first date! This is an eggshell from the first time you made me breakfast in bed! This is from the museum from the first time we... were together. Okay, maybe I exchange gifts sometimes, but I keep the things that matter!
Oh that's okay.
Oh, Joey! Sorry!
Well, you should have.
Yeah, and could you please chop some up and just put it right there in the sauce?
Wait a minute. Chandler has a jewelry box?
Smell familiar?
No!
Thank you. Thank you very much. Umm, I've known them separately and I've known them together and-and to know them as a couple is to know that you are truly in the presence of love. So I would like to raise my glass to Monica and Chandler and the beautiful adventure they are about to embark upon together. I can think of no two people better prepared for the journey.
Well, don't look at me! My hair's straight! Straight! Straight! Straight!
Well,sounds like you two have issues.
Come on! Serious-ser-ser-seriously, what did she mean by that? Especially you!
Nodded off!! Ross you were snoring. My father's boat didn't make that much noise when it hit rocks!
Why not?
Pheebs?
Oh Phoebe, we forgot that party we have to go to.
Hi!
And hey! Just so you know, it's not that common! It doesn't happen to every guy! And it is a big deal!!
Excuse me. It's about the job.
Hey!
Well, I told him I would think about it, but I'm gonna tell him no.
So?
Nope!
That's great! Wow man, so Joey must've really taught you some stuff huh?
Wow.
Well neither do I!
I just can't believe this! I mean, with the holidays coming up- I wanted him to meet my family-
Honey, he's about to go hit on Isabella Rosselini. I'm just sorry we don't got popcorn.
Yeah and you had fun teaching him how to be all Joey.
Hey you.
Beef.
Pie in the hood, pie in the hood. Go.
Are you serious?
Well, they always called.
Wow! This is great! Look at all these cups! This is so weird.
He's got this thing. And I keep telling him to go to my chiropractor...
Oh, yeah! Real fun. Y'know, this bra... Really, bothers me. Y'know, this used to be my bedroom. Yeah. A lot of memories in here, a lot of memories. If these walls could talk, y'know what they'd say? Wanna hear some memories?
Ooh, Pheebs, what are you gonna say? Are you gonna tell him who you are?
I've got magic beans. Never-never mind.
Well, I've been up since six. Thanks to somebody's dumb-ass rooster.
I'm doing just fine! God, Tiffany, you smell so great!
No?
Yes, I did. Thank you very much, it was excellent.
No Ross!! Don't! You can't just kiss me and think you're gonna make it all go away, okay? It doesn't work that way. It doesn't just make it better. Okay?
Drums?
Oh, that sounds great.
Stop it! Cut it out! Cut it out!
Hm-mmm!
What? Wait a minute, I didn't pay, I thought you paid!
Well, we were going to do that after-I mean umm, next.
Y'know what, you are mean boys, who are just being mean!
Thanks! I've been here about six years, and Rachel moved in a few months ago.
God! And to have to hear about it from Gunther!!
Hi.
No.
Where the hell've you been?
What is the matter with you?!
Yes! Thank you! Exactly! You want it?
Why do you care about the guy who won the Paris trip?
Ugh! Look you guys, I'm really excited about this! Okay? I don't care what you think! I'm gonna go set up a little litter box for Mrs. Whiskerson. Well, what am I gonna call her? Fluffy?!
Are you drunk?!
Yeah?
It's Joshua.
Okay!
Oh come on, what are you talking about? You've got three years painting houses. Two whole summers at T.G.I. Friday's, come on!
That's great!
Nice? They were nice. I mean, that's it? I mean, mittens are nice.
Nothing.
Hey!
Why, does she have a bad personality?
Ah.
Shut up that was my friend Melissa from college.
No-no, I bought those.
Ohh, whoa God! Storage rooms give me the creeps! Monica, come on please hurry up honey! Please?
What did you just say?
You don't pick me! You're stuck with me!
Ok, so uh, who wants the last hamburger?
Fine! I judged you. I made a snap judgement. But you did it too! And you are worse because you are sticking to your stupid snap judgement! You can't even open up your mind for a second to see if you're wrong! What does that say about you?
Oohhh.
Hey, you guys...
Hey.
I think you should drink the fat.
I know. I know. Oh God. There's no tissue! Can you grab me some toilet paper?
Uh well, I guess I'm not gonna miss the fact that you're never allowed to move the phone pen.
Wow! Monica!
It's worse than the thumb!
It's not a big deal!
I had one glass.
Umm, well I would have to say that it's a, it's tragic love story.
Let us keep the apartment and...
I ah... Oh! I'll squeeze you fresh orange juice every morning!
So umm, what time are you supposed to leave?
Whoa! Y'know what Katie? I gotta tell ya I-I-I-I think you are the one who is too much.
Ross, you don't know that.
I'm sorry, let her?
Really?
Oh my God, they told us that was for the mascot!
What? What?!
I haven't seen him in so long!
That was you?! We heard about you in Junior High! Did you really just shake your fist in the air and shout, "I will be revenged?!"
Yeah but, my assistant Tag does sit-ups in the office during lunch. Ohh! I could just spread him on a cracker.
Sophie sit!!
Well, here's another question for ya. Uhh, do you know what that silver knob on the toilet does?
Monica and Chandler are really moving in here and I have to move out and everything is changing.
Right!
You think about stuff like that?
Yeah, but that was different. Y'know? I mean, we were, we were going out then, now I think it's weird.
Maybe, but shouldn't we wait for Chandler?
Come on Joey, I just bought you a new chair! The most expensive one in the store! Hey, y'know what I was thinking? We could name her Francette.
Okay.
Oh yeah! Oh my God! That is our friend! It's Naked Ross!
Oh, making it worse!
You're kidding.
It won't come off!
What?!
Why?! Why not?!
Yeah and we'll drop it off downstairs so that we're not tempted.
Oh, Chandler that is so nice.
Okay! All right! How was she?
Well, have you been involved with someone where you haven't broken up?
Ahh.
...I think that bitch cracked my tooth.
I, I don't have it.
That sounds like a plan. Umm, is there a place I can go freshen up?
What?
Okay.
I know.
Yeah, and none of these stupid grocery questions, real personal questions.
Oh! Oh, I love that but.
Yeah?
Then, you will definitely get him back!
Ooh, and it's so nice having this little sink here...
Okay Phoebe calm down, there's no need to place blame. Okay? I warned her about those candles.
Yeah, I went to a wedding once where they had swing music and uh, two months later the couple got divorced. And now I'm not saying that there's any connection here y'know, but they did tell me that's why they got divorced.
Really?
That's not true!
Yeah!
Monica, what is with you? Who'd you have lunch with?
Okay, it's missing something. Ooh, I know! Umm, okay.
Oh yeah! I know.
Ok, he's goin' to get my coat. He's goin' to get my coat. Oh my god, you guys. I can't believe this. This is unbelievable. What's that?
Jill?
Okay. Okay. Okay. Umm, maybe you can start with, "Chandler, even though we were friends; there was a part of me that always knew I wanted more."
Wow! How are you?!
I'm not telling you what to do! I am telling you what not to do!
Oh, I don't know. I guess it's not about no guys, it's about the right guy, y'know? I mean, with Barry, it was safe and it was easy, but there was no heat. With Paolo, that's all there was, was heat! And it was just this raw, animal, sexual...
Well, I was kinda supposed to be headed for Aruba on my honeymoon, so nothing!
What?! What?! He was trying to cheer me up! My pony was sick.
Because, he's my friend.
You know what, it's feeling a lot better, thank you, um... Well, listen, why don't you two sit down and, and we'll get you some glasses... okay... STAT!
Momma's Little Bakery, Chicago, Illinois.
No.
Okay.
I can't believe I don't get to go to my own prom, this is so harsh.
Hi! Thanks, hey so uh what'd you do last night?
No, it's all right. I got nice boobs.
I was laughing! You made me laugh!
I know.
No. I just need to be by myself for a while, you know? I just got to figure out what I want
I-I am not uptight-Hey-hey-hey-oh-oh! Listen, I am not uptight, man.
No. She doesn't die.
Why? Who's not having. . . Are you and Julie not, are, are you and, are you and Julie not having sex?
Why are you adding, why are you adding, why are you adding, why are you adding?
OK, I'm doin' it for ya.
I'm so sorry! Are you okay?
Yeah?
Now wait a minute that's not fair. He was married to me a hell of a lot longer than he was married to Emily, he just didn't tell me. Maybe I have to pee again.
Then what's with all the bananas?
So don't do it.
Right,.. well,.. we never actually got to that... Oh, it was just so nice to see him again, y'know? It was comfortable, it was familiar... it was just nice!
Yes!
Who's this from?
Just a bug.
Oh, c'mon. We'll have, we'll have a big party, and no-one'll know who's with who.
A couple of bucks.
Yes! Yes! Yes, I do! I do know! Frank and Alice are gonna want to keep all of their children!
Why don't you just marry her? Oh no, wait a minute you can't, I'm sorry I forgot, she's not a lesbian.
All right, well the place was closed. I'll just copy it later.
Umm... I'm never gonna getting married!
Thanks, but I gotta go to work and get my eyes scratched out by Mindy.
So you're gonna be in the car, I will be upstairs, and that's where everybody's gonna be!
Yeah.
Well, then can we meet him?
Well that sounds fun too.
Whoa, that Diet Coke just went straight to my head! Woo!
It wouldn't have mattered anyway, Phoebe, you and I are, are gonna live together, we're roommates; that's the deal.
Well, you were pretty damn good.
Well, I like you less!
Kinda.
I thought this might happen today. Ross, I know the holidays can be rough. Y'know? And it's probably really hard for you to be alone right now.
Joey, it's just a chair! What's the big deal?
And that's Phoebe , and that's Joey.
All right, we were shaking hands and he kinda leaned toward me... Y'know maybe he was going to open the door, but I totally miss read him and I uhhh...
I forgot... I am supposed to pick up a friend at the airport. I am so sorry! I'm so... if you want to stay, and finish your drinks, please do.... I meanI'm sorry. I-I-I gotta go. I'm sorry.
Well, it doesn't sound like it! I mean, it's pretty easy not to kiss someone, you just don't kiss them! See look at us, right now, not kissing!
How about you guys?
Really?!
Oh my...
Ugh, that was so embarrassing! I can't believe you let me go on and on like that!
Yes!
You were gonna drink the fat.
Funny, because I was just gonna go across the hall and write that on Chandler.
What's that?
Oh. Right. ...Oh great.
Well... he happens to be a very nice... guy....
Wow! Look at that, Chip Matthews called. I wonder what he wants?
Y'know what? Fine, I don't care. Don't believe me, I know I'm right-do you guys want to go downstairs and get a drink?
Oh, how does he look? How does he look?
..You're, you're 'mah mah mah' what?
Yeah?
Oh, I'm sorry what?
You guys this cat is nothing like my grandmother's cat. I mean, it's not sweet, it's not cute, I even dragged that little string on the ground, and it just flipped out and scratched the hell out of me. And I swear, I know this sounds crazy, but every time this cat hisses at me I know it's saying, "Rachel!"
You're out of toilet paper!
Oh!
It's a uh, regatta gala.
Well that too. Joey?
She could be out of town. Maybe she'll be gone for months.
All right, come on, let's go get your coat.
Hi! Tag. What are you doing here?
A big idiot.
What?!
So what-what is the exhibit.
Ross, I'm doing everything that I can, I've got everybody looking for him, and I- Oh! Who is it?
Ross! We broke up two years ago; you've been married since then. I think it's okay that we see other people.
What was the book?
I mean, we are way past the fling thing, I mean, I am feeling things that I've only read about in Danielle Steele books, you know? I mean, when I'm with him, I'm totally, totally...
Chip! Hi, it's Rachel. Rachel Green. Yeah, umm, you left me a message. Yes you did, my roommate wrote it down. Monica Geller. Ohh.
What thing? What is this thing?
Well, I was gonna let you play with it.
Okay, your band is playing at Arnold's, collect three cool points. Which means, I have five, and that means I get Joey's boxers!
Excuse me, Dr. Bobby happens to be an excellent doctor.
God, isn't this exciting? I earned this. I wiped tables for it, I steamed milk for it, and it was totally not worth it. Who's FICA? Why's he getting all my money? I mean, what- Chandler, look at that.
Oh, well, are hey, are you nervous?
Okay. All right, I see what he's doing! He's not asking me out, because he wants me to ask him out.
Hi!
Joey!
You know, actually it's more like, hi.
Or maybe you would see me looking embarrassed because you are talking on the phone with your crotch!
You said she was bald!!
Ah, oh God. Oh, honey, oh that's OK.
Right?
It's really not that big!
We'll take Literature!!
I'm not saying that I'm a lesbian! I'm just saying that this happened!
Did Joey say what he was gonna go when he left?
Yeahh, but, but those really go better with pants. Maybe I should wear pants?
Oh, Barry..! Come on, this is all way too..
Okay! All right! How was she?
Okay now Joey, y'know that since you're returning all of this stuff right after the audition you're gonna have to wear underwear?
They're in Vermont!! How could this happen?!
Yeah, I forget which ones.
So uh, Pheebs, honey, how are those mood swings coming?
Just think, in a couple of years we get to turn into them.
Whoa-whoa, there's two living rooms? God, growing up here, this place must've been a real babe magnet.
Right.
Remember that big thing I was gonna tell you about?
I don't know, I don't know. Urrrgh! Look, maybe we should take a break.
Um. yeah.
Yeah, because I was mad at you, not because I stopped loving you!
Thanks Chandler.
Ooh, ooh, ooh,ooh,ooh. Hi.
Wait a minute! What are you gonna tell Joanna?
Oh...see... but Joanne loved Chachi! That's the difference!
Wow! It looks like the Easter Bunny's funeral in here.
Oh God, I know I'm a pathetic loser.
And I'm in it? Then let me read it.
Okay!
I hate when Ross is right!
Oh it does, it does! It is a room separating apparatus from Colonial times.
Ohh, thank you.
Is there room on that step for a pathetic loser?
Ah, so what are we looking at?
We?!
Not right now.
So you know, I...I handed in that marketing report and I never got to hear what you thought.
And sorta just put the receipt back in your pocket?
Hey!
All right!
What?
Daddy.
Monica, this is Dan , one of the guys that we're gonna be going out with on Saturday. Uh Dan, Monica.
I had a bra.
Oh, I'm sorry I spoiled you're evening.
Honey, what are you doing? That's too heavy.
Well thank you, you too.
Well isn't it better that I exchanged it for something that I enjoy and that I can get a lot of use out of?
Oh, that is so sweet!
Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me, excuse me, sorry. Hi.
What's that song? It has been in my head all day long.
Really?
All right, will you, will you at least tell him how hollow and unsatisfying this, dating tons of women thing is!
Uh-huh.
Tommy's supposed to be here soon, we're going to lunch.
Okay.
Oh, can we read them?
See, I don't know, for me it would have to Chantal.
Horrible and degrading list of reasons not to be with me?
God. I forgot how much I love driving. I have got to get my license renewed.
What?
You promised you would break up with her!
All right. Be sexy.
Well, honey that was pretty obvious.
Well, is Ross home? Maybe I'll just call him to see if he's actually seen her.
No-no, they just had a big blowout over what to do with my room.
No, I've just always wanted to do that. Can you help me clean this up?
Y'know, with the right pair of pumps, that would be a great little outfit.
Honey, I'm sorry.
Oh! Well, um.. You've got plugs!
Yeah! Why?
Ewww, ewww, ewww, ewww!
That's not European!
Yay! Emily!
Okay, I'm totally cool!
Now you're probably going to hire one of the people who did not ah, who did, who did not umm, yell at you and storm out, and I think that's a big mistake and here's why. I made a huge fool of myself and I came back, that shows courage. When I thought you wanted sex in exchange for this job, I said no. That shows integrity. And, I was not afraid to stand up for myself and that shows courage. Okay umm, now I know I already said courage, but y'know you gotta have courage. And umm, and finally when I thought you were making sexual advances in the workplace, I said no and I was not litigious. {By the way, litigious means to want to litigate and litigate is to make a lawsuit against. So she didn't want to sue him. Don't worry, I had to look it up too.} So there you go, you got, you got courage, you got integrity, you got courage again, and not litigious. Look Mr...
Oh my ... you think I'm a pushover. Well wait, watch this, you know what? You're not invited to lunch. What do you think of that? I think that's pretty strong, that's what I think. Come on, Monica, let's go to lunch.
...how about I move in with you?
Oh, god.
Okay uh, but before you do that. I-I, I need you to talk to me.
What a jerk! You want me to kick his ass?
OK, OK.
Well, they never have any paper in there y'know. So my rule is 'no tissue, no tuschy.' Well, if everybody's going.
But I hired you!
Okay.
I mean I think I'd say no to anybody right now. Oh, but it was so strange. I mean I'm standing there with this charming, cute guy, who's asking me to go out with him, which I'm allowed to do, and I felt guilty. Y'know, like I'd be cheating on Ross or something.
Oh well, no I...
All right, let's go!
Do you wanna play football?
Monica, please?
Oh!
Something to do with numbers?
No! No-no, I love it. Thank you.
Oh! Ross is sooo great!
Surprise!!!
Monica. You've, you've done it right?
Oh my God, what a great surprise! This is such a beautiful house.
Oh, it's a Macy's bag!
Yeah. Yeah. Oh, but once you find it, ohh it's so worth the wait.
What are you talking about, Ross, you just said that you read it twice! Look, y'know what, either it does or it doesn't, and if you have to even think about it...
Noooooooo!
There you go!
Well, the cat... the cat turned out to be Paolo's cat!
Paul. Umm, I just wanted you to know that Ross really is a great guy.
Hey, who's this little naked guy?
Okay look, let me paint you a little picture. All right, you are settin' sail up the Hudson! You've got the wind in your h--arms! You-you get all that peace and quiet that you've always wanted! You get back to nature! You can go fishin'! You can-ooh, you can get one of those little hats and have people call you captain, and then when you're old, Cappy.
Hey!
What?
Right.
Goodbye, baby.
Now Joey remember, if you win you have to hug me! You hug me!
Hey!
Hey.
You do know that I will be here when he comes over.
Ross, what's the big deal? So I kissed the guy!
Hey, don't listen to them. I think it's sexy.
I'm an assistant buyer!!
Oh, he sees her!
Okay, well then how about puberty! Come on, that's always a painful time! Y'know your friends invite you to a slumber party and then they stick your hand in warm water while you're sleeping so that you pee in your sleeping bag.
Ohh, you should know, this place is a real babe magnet. Wanna make out?
No, I meant with the dropper over here.
What's the big deal? Why don't you wanna see Janice?
This one?
I overheard you guys on the phone the other day, and you said, "I'll just tell Rachel that I'm doing laundry for a couple of hours." And he said, "Laundry? Is that my new nickname?" And you said, "No! You know what your nickname is, Mr. Big."
You just finished?
Yeah?
Eww!
'Kay. Congratulations on your new job.
Hey! Hey-hey-hey!!
Ahhhh.
Oh, yeah, right.
Ooh! Y'know what? If we made reservations, we could have unagi in about a half-hour.
What?
Gimme a 'Y!'
Oh, I don't know. Well maybe it's just the idea of Barry for the rest of my life. I don't know I think I feel like I need to have one last fling, y'know, just to sorta get it out of my system.
No, these aren't all my suitcases. This one's Paolo's.
God I know, you're right.
Ohh, great!
Oh! Oh, I just thought of the greatest wedding gift to get you.
Okay.
What?! What?! My birthday's not for another month!
Still in love with?!
Oh they're pushing! They're pushing!!
Uhhhooo.
