Well the duck can swim.
Sounds like a date to me.
So are you gonna...talk to her?
And, a lemon lime.
Oh, how well you know me...
Oh! It's on! It's on!
I-kea! This is comfortable.
Put Joey on the phone.
No. No. I don't think so.
Oh okay, I'll-I'll try.
Oh o-, OK man.
I'll catch you guys later.
Oh, what a crappy night!
But I think we should tell her.
Can you people not see me?!
Hey, Rach, can I get...
Man, I am so beat.
Could've been a peach.
What?! What are you talking about?
That's not specific to girls.
Phoebs, play with meeee.
How do you know that? How?
Don't play with his things.
Hey guys, what are you doing?
Okay, who wore those?
Hey, y'know what? I was wrong.
Yes, money well spent!
I never want to leave you again!
This game is kinda fun.
Althea?! What are you doing?!
What about the obsessive cleaning?
The man's got a point.
Your boyfriend is so cool.
Yes! Ross, you have to stay!
That, that's what's stupid.
You mean the lully story?
I want you to say that you like her!
Did she go out with him?
How about Joey... Pepponi?
I can't believe it! We're here!
Because I'm gonna play for ya.
So uh, what are you in for?
You're shooting with Althea?!
Ah! Ahh!! Ahh!!
Fine! Maybe I will too!
We've got to do something!
...And what did you bring?
Takin' that with you, huh?
What did you guys just do?!
What-what 'cha doin'?
To pay for the gym.
Hey! Hey, hey-hey, hey.
He thought you said gonad.
It's exactly like it sounds.
Ring dammit, ring!
Well that's a full cup!
That was there when I got here.
Take off your shirt!
This is going in your book?
Oh, you must stop shooping.
Man, I gotta get a kid.
You're right, this is more fun.
Did you not understand the story?
I know, it's beautiful. Amazing.
Can I finish my story?!
She's just doing her job!
Why haven't you told them?!
Okay, bye! Oh my God!!
Oh, right, right, shut up.
What stupid thing did you do?
Hey Joe what's up?
I paid for those tickets!
Oh that's not bad, Pheebs?
Hello sir, you know Monica.
Well you proved them wrong.
Beam me up Jesus.
Okay, we owe you a present.
Yes have you seen any?
Hi! Nice to meet you!
There we go little fella.
That's perfect! That's brilliant!
The reason he just said.
Is anybody else scared?
You are so great! I love you!
I'm sorry, did you say cheese?
But honey you don't have to.
Oh, good. Rog is here.
Oh no-no-no. This is amazing.
No, no, this is the first time.
That's what they'll call us.
Don't worry about it Pheebs.
Okay. I wanna quit the gym.
Well, how you died was funny.
You have to pick your moments.
No, because you're not a grandmother!
What if Joey were president?
What about that circled one?
She picked those out too.
And no kissing your neck.
Dude that is so sad.
It was a "Wendy's!! "
Okay, look, just do it gently.
No don't I beg of you!
What are you guys doing together?
The wife says "Hi!".
Oh, uh, listen, about tonight...
Is there a puppy here?
You're naked in this picture!
She said she'd call me.
Do you know what I was thinkin'?
Way to be cool, man.
Yes, this, this was pleasant.
Oh, we could do this all day.
Because I'm in love with Monica!!
Actually Monica and I are engaged.
OH MY GOD!!!
Oh they didn't want to come!
I said, "Like what?"
You don't know. You didn't see it.
Doctor Connelly just called.
Oh that's great! Good for you.
Y'know, that party wasn't bad.
Hey! Did you find the cameras?
How's your room Rach?
Yes, yes, we had the sex.
Oh, the tears are real.
It was a car backfire!
I married Fred Sanford!
Well, like father, like son.
I thought your time ran out.
So, is Janine around?
Kori? Kori Weston?
God, I love these fingers...
Yeah, I've been there my friend.
It is so good to see you!
Okay. How about in that cabinet?
Ah, finally an explanation.
Well, I-I guess I gotta go.
Pheebs! Always a pleasure.
This, this actually is a...
Pretty good! I told her.
I'm afraid I might just be.
Oh, so that's what this is for.
Y'know that wasn't part of it?
Eh..., I don't, I don't know.
Oh, that was my work laugh.
Your liking it, huh?
Sounds like a fun party.
Who the hell is Carl?!
Why is your family Ross?!
Well, I've got a girl in here.
Sure, I'll do it with ya.
Who are you going out with?
Oh, is that against the rules?
Oh come on you big faker!
We're teeth people Zack!
You're definitely scaring here.
Yeah, I'm not sure I can do that.
No-no-no-no! That was the joke!
And the world will never know.
Okay, I promise, I'll end it.
I'm doing this because I'm sorry?
Hey, look at all the boxes!
Dude, don't do that too me!
Die Hard still great!
Hey, big guy, game time.
All right, I'll pick that one.
Eddie, do you remember yesterday?
I'm sure you're right, but why?
Well, I, I should go in there.
I got it! Scotch... tape.
So ah, whatcha watching?
Game's tomorrow night Joe.
But, I never left the room!
So, we gettin' a fish?
Yeah, right, yeah, I guess so.
Man, she is really gullible.
No not Candy Lady.
Oh no, you'll have to come.
Hiya doin' pumpkin?
You're turning into a woman.
And was the curse lifted?
Not once did we do that.
Which is why you should do it.
You're a little high maintenance.
You're not gonna need my help?
They're still just friends, right?
How do Monica and Phoebe know?
Why wouldn't they be happy?
I can't seem to say goodbye.
Okay, excuse me for a minute.
Me! On my computer.
Yeah, and I don't have any cologne.
No! Her boyfriend Richard!
Yes that was a nice place!
Two hours, that lasted!
You can't just call Monica's room.
Hey! How'd the audition go?
Mma, Mma, Mmaah
Ooh! Calm down ...
Oh my God, what's up?!
There you go! There you are!
And a bagel with only...
No, that was Dana Caplin.
You hear that? We're the guys.
I always liked you, Ken.
You're turning into a women.
Y'know uh, I didn't actually do this.
You had a bachelorette party?!
Okay, here is the phone bill.
So you're really okay with this?
Yes! You're never gonna make it!
Okay, what is in here? Rocks?
I've got canned goods.
Yeah, it's annoying, isn't it?
I'm not breaking up with her!
So whaddya got there Monica?
What the hell is going on?!
Okay, so when do you want to go?
Oh, good, Joey's home now.
Stay out of my freezer!
I can't believe the guys missed this.
Yeah, never cheat on Rachel.
We are gonna be great parents.
Uh, yes, yes it is.
Whoa, snowing out there?
Well then maybe you shouldn't go.
Uh, could you leave me one?
GET OUT NOW!!
No, did he hug you?!
There has got to be a way!
Hey! How'd the interview go?
No! No! Not, Paris.
Ahhhh-I'm not going to call you.
She was not good. Not good.
You're flingin'-flangin' right I am!
You said that to me last week.
I thought I had to make the jokes!
What are you guys doing out here?
Well then why can't I see it?
Why am I hearing cheering?
What've you been up to?
Well, so why not go knock?
Alright, we're gettin' closer.
He started mine first!
oh yes, God yes!!
Oh God, kindergarten flashback.
Joey! Joey! Joey! J-J-Joey-Joey-J-Joey!
Where's my seat belt?
Here we go, here we go.
What... did you get me there?
Well, those were seals, man.
I'm sorry, I got a little occupied.
Well, only if you order stuff.
Ooh, let me talk to him!
Yeah.... she's not so cute.
Our guy smells incredible.
Well, what did the police say?
Yeah, he thinks that's my name.
I'm gettin' my chair back!
Yeah, but I bet it works.
I know, but just let me say it.
Can I sleep on your couch?
Wow! Just like in the pros.
mmm That's enough about you!
Oh! Oh! That's so hard.
Oh my God, introduce us!
Oh yeah, there-there she is!
But then later that night...
I think so. Yeah, get off me.
It's yelling...bleeding...dilating. Oh, the dilating...
Well, you-you know what I meant.
When have I ever done that?!
There's a Phoebe on my sandwich!
Glass, sand, whatever.
Uhhuh, how did you know that?
But you said you were ready too.
I'm gonna put on some music.
Okay! You don't think I thought of that?
And this- is my reward!
I was shrieking... like a Marine.
Love your condoms my man.
Could there be more Kims?
Just act like you belong.
Hey, you said that without gagging!
No, actually Laurie's a boy.
Do you have my credit card?
Well, maybe you don't marry this one.
Whoa-whoa-whoa! We're having kids?!
Huh! Where is the dog?!
Oh, well... Maybe we could...
You know, I think I might just.
And then Joey remembered something.
Yeah, I heard you and Rachel talking.
As crazy as soccer?
But are you sure you can do this?
And the Knicks rule all.
Hey, woah, hey, woah.
Kinda. They're really big.
You did look like an idiot.
I'm not going to let you say anything.
Hello! One marriage please!
It's gonna be ok. You know that?
Well no, Charlie's gonna get that.
When did that happen to you?!
Well, she... she didn't win...
Bye. I can't stand the woman!
Janice is gonna go away now.
I do NOT want this unit!!
Youre not gonna lose him.
I'm not even... I'm not even...
What?! Why does she think that?
Jenny! That is so Jenny!
I wasn't staring. I was leering.
Well, you...don't look good Joe.
What is the matter with you ?!?
I think I do! Thank you, Monica.
Ah! The high road...
I didn't know you had another level.
Bye. Are you still out there?
We don't need to remedy that.
What does yours say Pheebs?
I don't know... um, Grease?
I did pay for half of it.
All right buddy, way to go!
If I see him, I'll ask.
Oh, well thank you in advance.
No! We're not borrowing money.
Wow! Look at them run.
Well then maybe you should take it.
I'm gonna grab you some tissue.
Can I give you a present now?
Yeah, I just got uh, got plans.
You went home with the waitress.
I'd love it if you would do it.
Can you figure out what I'm doing?
We're not gonna lose to girls.
Hey! Did you have the baby yet?
"Happy Birthday Peehe."
Mm! Night Gar'!
Sydney Portier? Hehheh.
WHAT IS IT?!
You totally screwed him over.
No freakshow, she's fictional.
That was pretty intense huh?
The one time they're not home.
So you didn't mean any of that?!
You left a shoe here?!
I quit and you learn what I do?
There are seven?! That's one?
Oh, that's-that's okay, no problem.
Op, op, I'm convinced!
Hey, Kicky. What're you doing?
Quick! What time is it?!
I got the time to get to know Julie.
That new mountain bike?
Might wanna try Joseph.
So what job did you get Joe?
Paid your phone bill?
Nothing, I just like to go like this.
Still on Amelia Earhart?
Nope! I can do this all day.
Yes, you can pass for 19.
Okay, let's play my game now.
Well it's not Sean Penn.
Sure. Ummm. What's up?
Yes, but I-I uh, don't have too.
Well, it still has to go, right?
Oh, I got some thoughts on that.
See, I told you they don't swim.
Well, that's what we said about Joey...
Wow, he looks so normal.
I'll look forward to your call.
Stop talkin' to your men.
I'm gonna ask Monica to marry me.
Well, that makes me feel so good.
But I love swing music!
: I thought we had them!
There you go! Someone came!
How about those three pointers?
There's no back to this couch!
Oh, okay. Send her in.
I have *not* thought this through!
Your work makes me sad.
I love you. And I know about the baby.
There's a forest right outside.
Oh, you don't want me on the trip?
Joey was in a porno movie.
Now this feels like Thanksgiving.
Y'know what? I-I kinda have.
You mean you didn't get it from this?
Ooh, I do! I do! I do!
I'll get you the Cliff Notes.
And he's not speaking metaphorically.
They got a breakfast buffet.
No! No! No! I can't do that!
Joey, I saw you push him!
All right, call it in the air.
Lets not do that any more.
Hi, Nina. Come on in.
They're in my bag over there.
No. How are ya Paul?
And I think Ross is generous too.
Shh! Nice to see you again.
I'd like a Google Card.
No, we only went out once.
Yeah! All right! You go first.
Wow that's actually pretty cool.
Oh you've got to be kidding me.
God!! What am I gonna do?!
Thanks Joey, that's a good idea.
Oh, I'm sorry, then you're widowed?...Hopefully?
All right, maybe I should call her.
Yeah, you almost overreacted to something.
Well, maybe it was God, doing me.
Man, that's some bad advice!
Who said anything about Christmas?
Ok, well, this was very special.
Ooh, oh, oh, that's her.
I don't know. Should we try it?
Did it turn into sand?
Well, she wasn't sleeping with him.
Okay, but now see you're crying!
This game makes no sense!
Why are you screaming and hugging?
What do we use to split it?
I love you, St. Valentine.
Oh no nonononononnononono, don't go..
Okay, you ready for the last picture?
7:15. Watch doesn't work.
Kill me. Kill me now.
You can always sell your baby.
Please tell me you got the message!
So uhh, how's the palace?
...That's it. I'm getting cigarettes.
Guys guys, check this out.
This is the best game ever!!!
Did you do it on our invitations?!
How did you? How? How?
Here we go! Here we go!
Yes, we're standing out ground...apparently.
It's alright. Is she good-looking?
Oh, but it's not 'til tomorrow!
Hey! Remember when I had corneas?
Well, did-did you correct him?
Oh, she's sorry! I feel better!
Our next cocktail party?
Your last roommate's kidney?
What we did last night was....
Do either of you have the keys?
It's a kitchen slash bathroom.
Okay, the old hug and roll.
Now you do that, you're on TV.
Yeah, it's a very large plane.
Y'know Richard...you are a good guy.
My friend's name is Joey.
Yeah well, I'm gonna go spit.
Wait! You're going out with Kathy!
Yeah, 'cause I already asked Janice.
Man, didn't she like just get here?
Did somebody sign your bra?
Neat. I'm gonna die alone.
I had the exact same conversation.
Wow umm, calm down.
I am strong! I'll show you!
You, touching yourself, out!
Yes, every single one of them.
Why don't you open with a joke?
I didn't know it was a big secret.
...and then it got canceled.
Huh-huh! You can't give her that.
No one was around to hear that?
What are you crazy? That's a baby!
So you really OK about all this?
Oh no, you see, actually it is.
Okay, but if you can't...no dinner!
Oh, I just wanted to say, "Hey!"
The man is showing brain.
I don't know, five hundred dollars?
Hey Mon, how's it going?
What in God's name is that?!
And I just want a million dollars!
I think we've found our sperm!
Are those my wife's nipples?
We're flipping Monica's mattress.
Joey's tailor...took advantage of me.
Oh, I can uh, check that for ya.
Oh well, that makes it not terrible.
Excuse me. How ya doin'?
Yes, and we're very excited about it.
I know, I still am one of these.
Just a little bit of sugar.
Oh, and uh, the fabric softener?
Step away from the duck.
Well, why can't you do them tomorrow?
I'm a little busy here Paul.
Ok, they're coming, shhh.
How is that ever going to happen?!
What do we do? What do we do?
...Take off their hats!
I cannot believe you didn't pick me.
I don't care, she slept with me.
Oh my God, how did you do that?
We have free porn here!!!
Okay, well tonight's the big night.
I don't see him. Do you see him?
No, no he went for a walk.
I can't figure out what to make Monica.
Rachel, could I see you for a moment?
Man, I'm so lucky I have Monica.
Yeah, why not. So I told her.
We're notwe're not saying anything.
Really? Right across the street?
But, we'll stay here with you.
does what always have to be sharks.
Yeah, you-you gotta love the talking.
Hey, whoa-whoa! What's she like?
Either, it makes no difference.
Your family name is Tribbiani.
Hey, what did your agent say?
How do you know so much about this?
So you uh, want to do something tonight?
Our guy has great hair.
Whoa-ho, back off, Missy!
Joey, what-wh-wh-wha-wh-wha-wh-wha-wh-wha-what are you doing here?
I-never borrowed your Walkman.
I'm going to need a bigger boat.
I happen to know a Fun Bob.
He's taking off her coat!
It doesn't say that. Does it?
But the Kit-Kats are all right?!
Oh yea yea, absolutely.
Well we...we still hang out.
Because the kids need new shoes.
You wanna see if we still have it?
Well, now, I actually have to get to work.
Oh, I'll go out and get you some.
What?! I'm Chandler! Oh, that's Richard!
More so than anything else.
Mrs. Braverman must be out.
Hey, look, what do you want from me?
So uh, which one is mine?
Wherever! I've got like 20!
L-leaving my troubles behind?
How long have we been home?
Y'know, I've had dates like this.
Actually, uh, we're both the father.
Okay. But it is officially nighttime.
Have you talked to him lately?
You want me to wear your panties?
Hey, you have got to try this cheesecake.
Alright I feel youger already!
Turns out he is kinda funny.
I don't think the flash went off.
Right behind you, big guy!
No! No! No! I just kissed her.
Joey, can I talk to you for a second?
Well it's not flexed right now!
Here it is! Here it is!
Fears and Pet Peeves.
And that's... how... it's done!
Honey? Leave it to the pros.
Joey told you about the leg, huh?
What am I supposed to do with these?
Some guy, Tom Gordon.
Do you remember talking to me yesterday?
Well, you do want all that stuff, right?
No, no, no, you say that proudly.
Okay, so this time I won't quit!
Yes...Yes..Uh-huh, You? We did you.
Yeah let's head off to work.
Too bad, she's leaving.
Well, what if all my stuff was here?
Oh yeah, I should probably call them.
Diagnostician or boo-boo fixer?
He didn't say anything about that to me.
Yeah, I guess it's a little better now.
Have you ever been with a woman?
You're building a post office?
Thank you for that! I was not flirting.
Look out kids, he's coming!
Okay, you guys uh, you guys pick first
Hey! So are you enjoying the bike?
No, he's right, I'm totally lying.
Okay, so you both just know this stuff?
Yes, 98.6. You're gonna be fine.
Okay, okay. So, should I call her?
Yeah, I think we should see other people.
That's funny, I saw no phlegm.
You still can't stand her can you?
We don't have to come up with this now.
Do we have to make the entire thing?
Hey, come on, it's not your fault.
I'm not fine. Here she comes.
Well you did pull his hair.
Yeah? You don't think it's just pathetic?
Are you trying to get everybody divorced?
Would you like to have dinner sometime?
Joe. Joe! Answer the phone.
Oh, I'm sorry, so 'we' is?
So, uh, you met someone, huh?
Yeah but you don't need--What is this?
Ehh, you're just liquored up.
I was not and oh God, shh!
It's like this, me, no jokes.
Y'know I think we should invite them.
Oh, this is horrible, it's just horrible.
I'm an alien. I'm an alien.
For an emergency just like this.
I need to talk to you, it's urgent!
Joey, why is your cable out?
But I don't wanna do it in a cup!
And, we're done with the yogurt.
Oh suddenly, flowers are feminine?
The food there was, was great.
I could fall asleep at a play.
Oh, well give me the phone then.
Last time I do that, I promise.
And now you're giving me the message!
Oh look, it's the woman we ordered.
Hey that's what I tell girls about me.
I hope she throws up on you.
...little playthings with yarn?
You are a frightening, frightening man.
Oh. Oh, did-did-did I wake you?
No! No! No! I was so careful!
Rach, Rach, we gotta settle.
Monica, can I talk to you for a sec?
Would you please get some rest!
The Hard Rock Caf?
Yes, include more people in this.
And condoms are the way to do that?
Oh! She's growing inside you.
Oh yeah, it's actually in my bedroom.
Well you don't have to sound so surprised.
Oh, tell her good luck with that.
Mom. Thanks for wearing something.
Oh so there can't be any yelling.
Okay, 'cause that's not gonna get annoying.
Hey, so can you make it on Friday?
So, you feel like a dad yet?
Well I'm not showing you my 'tat.'
No, come on, you know that's not true.
Well, we're-we're hanging out in here!
Okay, so you will meet our guys?
You really think that is what he meant?
This is the New York Times.
Oh it's uh, over there on the table.
Yeah, we're gonna need to see that tape.
Yeah. Is that a dinosaur tie?
Of course it is. Wow-whoa!
Yeah, I know. She makes me happy.
See? They're Joey's! J-J-J-J-J-Joey's!
Well, actually just one birthday flan.
Do I smell essential oils?
Maybe that's because soy-burgers suck!
Madre Sierra the of Treasure!
Treasure of the Sierra Madre!
I found a dried up seashores.
Something else I might have said?
And there's not chance that will work?
It's your mommy. It's your mommy.
Believe me, sometimes that happens.
That's easy, baggage claim.
Yes because uh, you look so young.
Huh? Where, whaddya mean?
Okay, I don't think we can turn anymore!
No, we'd just like to close them.
Yeah, why don't we lose the gloves.
You look beautiful. Is this new?
Yah, I think I broke my hip.
Okay... ..whose turn is it?
You can't leave! I have your shoe!
They got a phone in there, right?
Tell it to the Time Turtle!
See now it feels like Christmas!
Oh, we're gonna flip for the baby?
Sure, everybody loves a kidder.
Well, where's the logic in that?!
Well I like both eggs equally.
That was like 5 years ago.
But we're not ready to tell yet!
It's Thursday! How was the audition?!
Not even on page 7?
Is this because of the burrito thing?
Okay, how'd it go at the doctor's?
You don't think I get up when you get up?
Apology accepted. Excuse us.
When did I try to give you money?
David is going to propose to Phoebe.
Yeah! Totally! Totally, and you?
One of the slots got filled.
And now I've picked it up again.
Woah, woah, that's not pretty!
I didn't know Ross and you were so close.
Well maybe it was all of your questions.
'Cause, I wanted to uh, give you this.
More coffee over here, please!
No, I wasn't gonna ask you that, no.
NO! No, I'll take that for ya.
I used to have that bumper sticker.
He just said, "No strippers."
It means we're holding hands.
Oh, yes, could I have one of those.
And lots of kissing your neck.
Basically we just feel that he's...
Are you actually saying these words?
Why would our guy be a weirdo?
And uh, Rachel, glad to have you back.
Wouldn't that be Frank the III?
Weird world. Your kids?
The whole thing! Can we go?
Oh totally! Pull my finger.
I wouldn't read too much into it.
Where did you hear it from before?
You mean like for award shows?
Look, we can't stay in here forever.
And yet you're surprisingly upbeat.
All right, I'm off to see your dad.
We really...didn't get a chance to...
Fine, I'll give the suit back.
You're not a dad. You're not a dad.
So then I guess Ferdinad is out.
I don't know, Monica picked out the flowers.
Oh, ok, 'cause we never do that.
Not to mention the cold sores.
Uhh... Yeah sure. Click!
Yeah. Thanks for making me do this.
First I was afraid, I was petrified.
All right, I'm nine years old.
Hey, you guys all know what you want to do.
Eh, somebody's in a good mood!
Well, Kathy's last boyfriend was Joey.
Okay, yeah, I think it's really stuck now.
Ok, look! Enough is enough!
Do you want me to be afraid of you?
Oh, I don't think I ever heard that story.
Okay, I'm going to go stand over there.
So I'm not, not gonna lose her?
In a foreign, romantic country...
Richard was there so I couldn't do it!
Well, you owe me one, big guy.
We're you just ten seconds later!
Okay Ross, why don't you come with me?
I stole Monica's and changed the name.
OK, this one right here is from me.
OK, so now we draw cards.
I will have the uh, Cajun catfish.
I'm sorry, I guess I just like the pulp.
Whoa-whoa-whoa! You broke Joey's chair?
So, uh, wh-where ya from?
I don't believe they're brother and sister.
So it's pretty much the same Pheebs.
Yeah, well. It's the right thing to do.
I'm never gonna find a roommate, ever.
Well now-now you're just talking crazy.
Oh, yeah! How did you meet her?
Yeah, I wouldn't know having missed everything.
Yes talk to her. Be a man.
I got something for her. It's a book!
She's okay with Rachel and the baby?
Uh why, do you have a lecture?
That's so cool. I'll let Monica know.
Yeah. We're doing the right thing, right?
I'm just going to wait for a little while.
Nina? Nina. Nina. Nina.
I'm coming over tonight though, right?
And you're gonna make them all disappear.
Is he the one with the beautiful wife?
How do you not fall down more?
Yeah umm, they're called wallets.
Well, you're forgetting about the time difference.
Your sister Joan is crazy.
What happened? I'm just eating candy.
Thanks, I'm glad you see it that way.
Higher or lower than what?
Ooh, I don't know if we're there yet.
Gee, Monica, what's in the bag?
Yeah, I've always hated that Howie.
I can't believe you got us into trouble.
I'm smoking. I'm smoking, I'm smoking.
That's very funny. We done now?
Yeah, well, I don't dance at weddings.
Shh! It is a family name!
Yes, Bravo on the hot nanny.
Feelings, such strong feelings.
Happy Anniversary, 10 months!
Yes that would have made more sense.
Ah sure. What's in 'em?
Oh, no, no. I just meant hypothetically.
I've been taking dancing lessons.
Did you tell her what we talked about?
Y'know Pheebs, it's kinda our anniversary.
All right! I found one that fits!
Then you're gonna have to watch it for me.
Oooh-hoo, very attractive, forgiving.
let ME be a part of this!
You do know that Wham broke up?
Fowl? No. Women? Nooo.
Umm, how's it going with you guys?
So, basically just a Chinese guy.
No, the baby's out! Look, look!
You think we're ready for something like that?
Ho-ho, you win! 50 dollars!
Yes I did, and I think you should do it.
It's not gonna be exactly like last time.
Hi. Anybody know a good tailor?
In the James Taylor case.
I just wanted to show Monica your book.
Work people? Nobody told me.
I'm kidding. This is going to be fun.
Oh what's the matter? Are you scared?
Oh hey, how'd the interview go?
Will you excuse me I have to um.....
Well that would help the pride thing.
Well maybe you don't have to tell him anything.
Hey. Hold on a second. Huh?
We were playing poker, alright...
How about the closet by the bathroom?
Sorry! I-I-I don't know what to say.
All right! Bring it on, you...
No, the little girl creeps me out.
So you know this leaves us with...
You're it! Now run and hide!
Yeah, right here in my pocket. Pheebs?
That's so funny, because I think I just did!
Yes, and I was saying the actual words.
Batman has a utility belt!
Are you hugging the door right now.
Love what you've done with the place.
Alright, now try taking a puff.
Have I got the 50 guys for you!
Oh. You mind if I join you?
A hundred and forty-five pounds.
We really need to take those tests?
I said, "Geez, relax Monnnnn."
Nancy Thompson's getting fired!
Hey, how's the first day goin'?
But what did he mean by rules?
Oh, man. I'm sorry, I'm so-so sorry.
Thank you Helen, that'll be all.
And protected them from a tornado?
Thank you. I got a job in advertising.
Did you like me when we first met?
What about things that are already gold?
Those aren't eleven and a half.
What did you do when they found out?
What about the ones you have on the nightstand?
Yeah, well, she's probably talking to Richard.
Could we be more white trash?
Ya know, the man's got a point.
What, what are you laughing at?
I'm sorry, are you just used to saying that?
I say we go with Careless Whisper.
I don't have a *job*! *Closing Credits*
Hi, Chandler Bing, I have a reservation.
Alright, one of you give me your underpants.
Well, I ended up telling her everything.
Bet she'd sleep with you now...
Listen, I'm really glad you got the part.
Then I got all needy and clingy.
Noho. Who doesn't they like me?
I can see why that's hard to resist.
Did you not hear me say, "Du-ude?!"
That means nothing to me. Come on!
So, uh, how often can you do it?
Because he was looking at her differently.
Alright! Just follow my lead!
Hello? Hey Charlie, what do you know?
He had sex with Mr. Girabaldi!
It's a nickname, I'll explain later.
Might wanna open with the snowman.
Oh, y'know I-I can't hear that enough.
They said it could be up to a year.
So you don't think I have a, a quality?
So I guess it's just uh, you and me then.
So we both finished our vows.
No-no-no-no-no-no-no, you are not getting me this way.
Kick save and... denied.
You built a fort didn't ya?
Well where... Where did she go?
So I really never get to win anymore?
OK, then, eat me, I'm done.
Should I tell her I ordered tea?
...Come on! Why are we here?!
But I do know that it's some time tomorrow.
Okay, y'know your not though. Let's go.
We are switching back, right now!
Wait a minute, I can't give this to her.
Oh yeah? Well, how'd she take it?
Had the money in the wrong hand.
Who cares? It's a stupid game.
I... I don't know... you seem lovely.
Well Monica just told me that they don't.
Are you aware that you're still talking?
Oh, sure, they love us over there.
Eh. I thought that was an alp.
I thought you were gonna be gone all day.
Well, it just hurts so bad. I uh...
Okay. Joey, trade lives with me!
What's the second part of your plan?
Where are they? Where are they?
You guys ready fore the movies?
What are the odds? What are the odds?
Oh I'm sorry! Do you need a break?
Because of the weekend, we had a fight.
I told you I should not wear this color.
I am so, so, so, so sorry!
Phoebe, I asked you to guard the ring!
Alright, what have we learned so far?
Oh, so you're going with the teacher, huh?
Oh great, food with hair on it.
And Milton Berle has a...
Maybe we'll have to listen and see!
Phoebe, are you having a heart attack?!
Come on, let me see that smile.
Eddie, I didn't sleep with your ex-girlfriend.
I'm leaning. This is where I lean.
Me asking is kind of a sign.
Is that what you're thinking about right now?
The key's stuck in the lock.
There's another carton right over there.
Why to save your dignity my man.
I'd carry you around in my pocket.
Yeah, but I'm, I'm so much faster...
OK, so at this point, the dealer...
Ross came in forth and cried!
Well, your kind of sitting in my seat.
Yeah all right, so we'll hang out.
Richard used to do it, didn't he?
Yeah, so, what's that supposed to mean?!
Uhh, Joey's grandmother is right there.
Oh come on! Are you listening to this?
Y'know, we haven't found anybody else.
Her ankle is what you're watching?
Uh, let's see, who do I hate?
You mean there's more than one of us.
Oh my God! Who's gonna watch that?!
Phoebe, it's me. You can tell me anything.
More importantly, was I any good?
Really? In front of all this people?
So, Zack's pretty nice, uh?
Great job with the cups, Pheebs!
Do you think he'll ever forgive me?
There is not one hair on that head.
Yeah! Okay, go, go, go get him.
Yeah all right. Okay, good night guys.
Yeah. Yeah, I mean what, what would we do?
We're on a semi-first name basis.
I would really love it if could do both.
Why?! Why do I have to tell him?!
Can you believe how lame this is?
Oh, uh, when-when are you coming back?
ahem... um... Crystal duck.
Okay, is this lamp in the same place?
You're not even giving them a chance!
I don't know. But I-I-I know I love you!
But if we win, we get your apartment.
Sorry, my my thing was in there with me.
Funny: Ha-Ha Or Funny
Sounds like a really bad idea to me.
Hey, there he is! There he is!
What? What did you take a picture of?
It's Paris, who knows we're here!
Wh-How did you lose at Cups?!
Ohh, she's-she's not really my type.
This is terrible. What am I going to do?
Do you know which one you're gonna be?
You got it. You got Nevada twice.
Oh, what can happen? I mean, would you...
Now imagine you live at the supermarket.
Don't judge me, I'm only human!
Oh, uhh, actually I uh, have some news.
Wait the uh, the kiss or the situation?
Look guys, I know it's a little steep.
I'm afraid I can't let you do that, Joe.
What's an identical hand twin?
I did. But it came at a price.
Because it's Sunday. It's God's day.
Like, when you're cooking a steak.
Okay uh, here's the electric bill.
Bullwinkle socks. That's so sweet.
Okay. I can't believe tomorrow's the big day.
I can't believe she can out run you man!
Oh well, that, that makes it not terrible.
Yeah that was stupid. Let's not do that.
Could you get us a couple of beers?
What? What are you, what are you talking about?
Hey, how was your breakfast with Hillary?
Okay, it's not a guy, all right, I know her.
Okay. 1...2...3-Go! I'm gonna kill myself!
Guys, guys, guess who I am?!
Listen, I-I'm gonna grab a beer.
I'm still mad at you for not telling me.
David, I'm pretending to read here!!
No-no, why don't you hang on to that one.
Bye..... ridiculously dull Bobby.
Is there any chance you didn't see that?
So, you still don't think I'm boyfriend material?
Depends on what you mean by we.
Okay, how long is this going to go on.
I think it's the dying cat parade.
Okay. It's not different at all, is it?
Hannibal Lecter...better roommate than you.
Are you sure? Did you see the stain?
Excuse me, you guys are getting tattoos?
Do you think you could get through a poem?
Ethan? There's, there's an Ethan?
...Poulet passes it up to Leetch!
Uh, Dana Keystone from college.
So, you feel like goin' for a run?
I know it would make me happy, ma'am.
That's right my friend. It's time for...
Joey! No way. I'm not answering that.
Hey Ross, look what I've got going here.
Hey man, how did the audition go?
Now, is that never talking about it again?!
You're pretending the pillow's a girl right?
I've had a very long, hard day.
Hey, my Father's house does that!
Ow, no 'woo-hooing,' no 'woo-hooing.'
Oh yeah, it's beautiful country up there.
We have to assign heads to something.
Yes, it is, at Office Max.
Hey Monica, here's your broom back.
Hey! Do we have a baby name yet?
Do you happen to know what I'm going to say?
Well maybe there is one thing you can do.
What size shoes do you wear?
What a coincidence, I listen in my sleep.
I'm gonna call and get off work tomorrow!
Why would the baby creep me out?
I can't believe she cracked your code!
We are. He's meeting us here.
I didn't know you read tea leaves.
No actually, I was just going for colorful.
Now why would she say that's embarrassing?
Ah, it's just a weekend, big deal!
You tricked me to get me into bed?
Now-now, why would you say that Joseph?
To Put the Camera Away!!!
That was you?! I thought it was Jack!
Yes! Am I crazy to be this upset?
It's weird! In a doctor's office?
Okay, but don't you think this is a little extreme?
Look, we have enough, just walk away.
Oh! Good for you Pheebs, way to go!
Well, it didn't say "This is a virus"!!
Oh my God! That's why I got up too!
Yeah, well, you're wrong! Okay, you're wrong.
Hey Joe! I was just watching a movie-e-e...
WENUS. Weekly Estimated Net...
'Cause it's-it's not his last name.
Oh, is she related to Ralph Lauren?
Yeah, I know, I did that two minutes ago.
What problem did you tell him you had?
C'mon, we're great together, why not?
Maybe Monica has a bobby pin.
Oh, that's OK, we'll figure something out.
Okay! This is it! We're gonna get married!
Oh, yeah! RACHEL TALKS TOO!
See, that's why we don't let her play.
You're on in 5 Ms. Minnelli.
You can say that because she's not your mom.
Nothing, Monica and I had a stupid fight.
Hell is filled with people like you.
Oh, hurry up. I want to sign that.
Okay. Well, I think the centerpieces are too big
Monica and I almost got married last night.
So they're going on dates? When?
Wait. Advertising! That's a great idea!
Dying people say the craziest things.
Oh you got a wedding dress? That's great!
Hey! Phoebe! We can talk to Phoebe!!
No, you kidding? The guy's a freak..
Yeah, just leave me alone for a while.
All right, look, look, what am I gonna do?
So uh, what did this woman look like?
Are you eating the cheesecake without me?!
Ooh, I'm alive with pleasure now.
Do you really find this attractive on him?
That's what you say at the end of a date.
No, no, no, actually losers rhyme.
There it is! So what're you gonna do?
Good luck, man. I hope you get it.
Well, your gonna need much bigger jars.
Hey, look, we're on that TV thing!
Run, Joey! Run for your life!
Something so sweet and...disturbing about that.
I think we may have really done it this time.
How can you not be wearing any underwear?
Is this a service you're providing me?
I mean, what am I supposed to do with myself?
Well, this is just as boring in England.
Guess who's back in show business.
Yeah I know, guess who beeped him?
Would you tell her I let you win please?
You are, you're gonna leave me like this?
You got a Cheeto on your face man.
I am proud of all my friends today.
Oh, no, no, no dear God, no!
Well, maybe it's because of the way you're dressed.
No. But I'm sure 'tomatoes' does.
I wish I had smoked for my career...
And you're our age. You're our age.
He took my joke, he took it.
This is the worst bachelor party ever!
Oh, thank you, sir... or man-who's-two-years-younger-than-me.
Air hole! Air hole!!
That's what I did when I lost my Clydesdales.
And monkeys can't write out prescriptions.
We don't know what could make this go away.
Tickets please! That's courtside baby!
I'm watching the game, but I'm not deaf!
Maybe we should give them some privacy.
Ah, sure, Nina. Whats up?
Why did you look at me when you said that?
I don't suck. It's sucks. You suck.
So, uh... what do you think it is about me?
We wanna hear Monica's Thanksgiving story!
He's really picky about his patients.
Honey, there's really nothing to worry about.
I think somebody has a crush on somebody.
You gotta let me slam the door!
Yeah. You're right. Hey I-I can do that.
Here we go. Okay, brace yourselves.
It is starting to get dark out there.
Oh dear God, there's two of them!
Honey, you remember my boss Doug right?
Whoever stood you up is a jerk.
Look Eddie, aren't you forgetting anything?
Stupid, useless Canadian money!
I didn't nail the boxes to the floor.
That guy's going home with a note!
Joey said that you're in here with another man.
Phoebe, we can hear the dog barking!
How about to the street say from the balcony?
Was the setting of Phoebe's triumph.
No, it was me. I'm sorry. I over reacted.
No, our guy is just a floating head.
Because you're the only one that can be fair.
All right, that's it, give me your underwear.
Actually, it's Miss Chinandolor Bong.
No, it came out to an even twenty.
So you didn't uh, choose Ross before me.
Uhh, you've had a lot of sex right?
'Cause he was just so darn cute.
Uh, no Pheebs. What's it look like?
Hey ladies! What are you in here for?
I'm sorry we, we don't have your sheep.
What does it look like? I'm going home.
Hey Caitlin! Somebody got a haircut.
We should always always break up together.
Well sensitive is important, pick him.
You can be the best man when I get married.
Okaaay, rock, hard place, me.
I don't think you did a very thorough job!
What, you guys really think that I'm that shallow?
The young hot ball and chain.
And look how happy the mom is now!
Why is there jelly on your shoe?
Yeah. And what you're doing feels so good.
Oooh, I'm afraid that does not exist.
So she's just waiting over there for ya?
I don't think we've actually done this before!
Well you coulda tried, not kissing him.
Alright, hang on a second there Custer.
Ahh, ooh, try a hard 8.
It got interesting! Damn you Oprah!
And is this in case the house sneezes?
Everything's gonna be all right. Okay, Dick?
Alright.. okay. No. Give it to me.
I feel violated. And not in a good way.
Pregnant Woman Slays Four?
What do you mean, like, buy it together?
Score! Where are the disposable cameras?
That's Mr. Girabaldi playing the piano.
You are not going to believe what I did today!
Okay we have to do something about your breath.
Yes, please don't spoil all this fun.
Monica can I talk to you outside for a minute?
You-you-you don't wanna give into the fear.
But you found the keys to his clothes?
Thanks. I'll see you New Year's Day.
Who jumps at loud noises!
Really?! That's what you heard? You said that?
No-no, not something stupid, something huge.
Well, I thought that would be the best thing to do.
Hey, Joey, Playboy printed my joke.
Well, uh, we can talk about that too Pheebs.
You dove in front of Ross! Ross!
Yeah well, I hear the place looks great.
Was it like a sneeze only better?
I just have to know, okay. Is it my hair?
I can't talk to you now, I gotta find Monica!
The Sooner State, whatever that is.
How long you been waitin' to say that?
Why don't you just give him to somebody else?
Those were like the best seats ever.
Multiple, so many paper cuts.
I can save you time ladies, I'm right here.
Tonight, on a very special Blossom.
Thanks for picking out the earrings man.
And yet you don't recognize that you're crazy.
Oh no-no, no you don't, just come back.
Seriously dude, 3 years ago.
What're we gonna do? What're we gonna do?
Ok. First of all, this is green!
I wanted to be with you. I missed you so much.
So you might say, the ring is irreplaceable?
Well, Ross and Emily aren't gonna use it.
Well, we're gonna... we're gonna figure this out.
You put your fist through the wall?
You're obviously not their favorite pet.
Of course I will call you. I love you.
Shocking! Since you still have the keys.
Oh good, I was hoping that would come up.
Where is she? I'm not scared of you!
We got some Vap-O-Rub in some places.
I'm still on my first. I just think you're nice.
Do not speak ill of the dead.
Then why didn't you tell me to do that?!!
Well that was before all the vaporizing action.
So I guess we wear swimsuits in here!
Oh yea, your right. It's the second one.
Here, pass these, will ya..
It's not a real game! I made it up!
Oh nope, I-I have plans with Joey.
Oh yeah? Is he funnier than me?
Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas!
The cushions are the essence of the chair!
And I also got... two more apples.
Ginger. I'm talking to Ginger, so....
Yeah alright. What're these, raisins?
Shhh, busy beaming with pride.
Marcel swallowed a Scrabble tile.
Ross and the most beautiful girl in the world.
Okay, listen this really hurts. Let's go.
Y'know what, we have to turn off the porn.
Yeah, we'll be down in like five minutes.
Well, I-I just didn't think it was funny sir.
Well, how do you find clothes that fit?
Is that what this is about? You like Caitlin?
We can? All right, I'm tryin' that.
You got waaaay too much free time.
It is when you put it together with that one.
Bye-bye little puppet Joey hand?
Does that mean I get the good loving tonight?
I called you fat?! I don't even remember that!
Well, let's see... Okay uh, is that her?
Were you're parents happy, or something?
Oh. Nope, that patch is no good.
Oh! Worm medicine for the duck.
Why can't I tell them that we live together?
You may wanna get some more of those too.
Thanks. You wanna see what it looks like?
Ba dum bumb cheshhh!
THAT'S TOO MUCH INFORMATION!!
Then why-why is she going to a play?!
I'm not your garbage man. I'm your mailman.
No, the doctors say it may kill her.
Why have I seen this thing three times?!
Treeger's snaking the shower drain.
Well, this does butch it up a bit.
Thank you! All right, I gotta go unpack.
Oh no-no-no, I'm, I'm paddling away!
Without my toe?! I need my toe!
Give him money? It was a joke!
Now I've upset you? What did I say?
Ahh, Merry Christmas; I miss you guys!
You have no trouble telling time now right?
Well, I think it's very brave what you said.
Because soap is soap. It's self-cleaning.
Julie Grath, my camp girlfriend.
98. 99. 100. Okay, go!
Well I've-I've never done that with you before.
Well, you're welcome! Glad I could help.
And I am not blah, I am a hoot!
Okay, that's like the least fun game ever.
That's the way I did it 'til I was 19.
Yeah, I'm sorry man. You wanna go watch?
And that's the only colour that comes in.
All right! Isn't this a woman's hat?
I can't believe we are even having this discussion.
Well, I thought you guys were cuddlily sleepers.
Well, you know, I appreciate you giving it a shot.
Well, she is going to know that you stole the joke.
No, you sh-No you said you made that up!!
I can't believe I did this! What an idiot!
Skidmark's still got a way with the ladies.
David is going to propose to Phoebe tonight!
I used to undress my cousin Glenn.
Oh, yeah! Thanks for inventing the lottery!
I don't want him to tell this story for years.
I've got five bucks says you can't.
Wow! I don't have the worst costume anymore!
Ok, you're going to have to stop that, forever!
Well, Phoebe I thought I'd--Yeah, what the hell.
Would you come on! Come on! Thank you.
Yeah, we're gonna have to get you out of those shoes.
Well, I thought- I thought you talked to Rick.
Because it's a relaxing and enjoyable time!
So you might say, it's a magic ring.
Couldn't I just say, "This is Ross?"
So you knew we were gonna miss the movie!
Excellent! Y'know Ross met somebody too!
Oh, my god, I'm so sorry. Are you ok?
Well, why don't we move this into the bedroom?
I did not say fat! I said, "Fa-aa-aw-ow..."
...And then he burst into flames.
Gary, I'm here to report a crime.
Well, remember the first time we saw Jaws?
I can't believe you don't know what I do for a living!
Okay! Come on! Let's go! All right!
Okay, you give the worst massages in the world.
My God! You must be good in bed!
That's just a lot of big talk, y'know.
Would you give me one minute!! Please.
Ding dong, the psycho's gone.
All right. Well, I'll check the guest room.
You didn't see how mad he was, y'know?
Yes! See you and I have always been like-
Okay, look, I'm gonna have to ask you all to leave.
Oh, I had an appointment to get my haircut...
To the left, to the left- aww!
Wow! She looks great. Doesn't she?
Did he just say, he loves Fonzie?
Well, I don't really know what that is, but let's!!
Yeah o-okay, but I'm just doing this for you.
Well, she looks the exact opposite of that.
They have that on the napkins at the club.
Phoebe, would you take a look at this mess!!!!
Helen drinks. Will you marry me?
Y'know we already went over this and I won!
Y'know, I saw a wine cellar downstairs...
So, do you know what you're gonna call her yet?
You're not actually supposed to stop on the bridge.
Look Joe, I know you wanted to do the wedding...
Yeah! yeah... The hard part is over!
You're kidding! Did you tell her I wasn't?
If it helps, I could slide over.
It just doesn't...feel like we're breaking up.
You couldn't have told me about this on the phone?
Yeah, like that thought never entered my mind.
So you risked your life, for a sandwich!
So, what do you thing the good news is?
Santa pants. Santa Claus's pants.
I'm telling you I think Phoebe thinks I'm foxy.
Aren't you just a tinsy bit curious?
I still don't get it, we didn't do anything wrong.
Okay. My word! Those are snug.
Oh well you're the best. You come here to me.
Ooh, she's asleep, that means we can...
You are aware that she's not a monkey, right?
No, just the months you actually want to live here.
Okay, how many of that girl are you seeing?
Okay! Oh man! Don't tell me I did this!
It's okay, you don't have to be the best at everything.
Maybe, she doesn't hit him all the time.
No, Eddie likes to keep it over there.
I love you too. And... I like you as a friend.
Not the disposable cameras from the tables.
That, that is funny. Can I have it back?
Well maybe you should put some ice on it.
Damnit. Alright call me when you know more.
No Joey! No Joey! Don't Joey! Joey!
Well that puts me in a difficult position.
Ok so, can I have my hat back?
Hey, that's... that's 'joincidence' with a 'C'!
So y'know, uh, when's he getting back?
Uh, Magellan? You got 46 states.
The cold weather hurts my hip!
Monica, you remember me telling you that joke, right?
Those are my gifts, I got them for you.
Please, one ridiculous problem at a time!
I totally understand. Can I just see your bra?
Oh, by the way, that is her full name.
Ooh, she should not be wearing those pants.
So, how many have you sold so far?
OK. Brake left, gas right?
Yes! Yes, but I can only pay $8,000.
I'm talking about you. You big, big freak.
Yes, we do. But, we have to change first.
Well, I did put a lot of thought in the tape.
Y'know uh, you didn't really have to help me pack.
Myyy mother, ladies and gentlemen.
Oh, it's awkward. It's awkward. It's awkward.
Unwilling to steal from work, interesting.
Well you might if it were anything like 7!
Is that Joey?! Let me talk to him!
Hi, I'm Chandler. Your live-in boy
Hey! Which one's my turkey burger?
Yeah. Do we have any Fruit Roll-Ups?
Y'know, I was hoping for a little more enthusiasm.
Yeah, what was wrong with your old...human teeth.
Wouldn't it be easier if we just moved?
Y'know that whole swimming thing is a myth.
Hey-hey, hey! I don't know why I did that!
Dear God! This parachute is a knapsack!
Course there, they just call it food.
Can I check out what she did to my room?
Alright I'll tell you what, I'll play you for it.
Oh my God!! Is everybody getting married?!!
Okay, will you just go help her change please!
I don't know, y'know. What, what, would you do?
Are you looking at naked tribe's women?
It's a big company, I don't-if you-I...
Yo!! Spackel boy! Get up!
I swallowed the sonic blaster gun.
Yeah I just... wanted to call and say hey.
Yes! Yes! A thousand times, yes!
Joey told me, he saw you two kissing.
Oh, yeah, that hug looked pretty brutal.
Sorry, the first guy runs the lips.
Actually he's the smallest person in the world.
You didn't think I used to wear glasses, right?
Because I told everyone he slept with dinosaurs.
What about all that "friends forever" stuff?
Yup, get ready for the gelatenous fun.
Twenty-three!! Seventy-four!! You wanna go shotgun?
I personally could have a gallon of Alan.
Well, they're Joey's! They gotta be Joey's!
Well I, I think we'd remember something like that.
Don't ask me, I was in there canoodling you!
I'm not in a meeting. I'm right... Whoops.
No! No! No! No--one can beat me.
Oh, Satan's minions at work again...
Hey Phoebs, can I have the milk after you?
It's my game. You want the job or not?
You are not allowed to laugh at my joke.
I said, 'So I'm not gonna lose her?'
Yeah, like there's any way I could ever do that.
I don't know. But I know I'm not afraid to do this.
If I broke up with you, I'd miss you.
Y'know who has a great video camera?
No. No, not at all, that's-that's ridiculous.
Say goodbye elves, I'm off to Tulsa.
Okay, well, then, I-I have to go to the bathroom.
No, just knowing you're gonna be there is enough.
Yeah, or you can do the easy thing and smoke.
You're coming on to the entire room! I'm Chandler.
I'm so glad we've got adjoining rooms!
And you wonder why Ross is their favorite?
Yes, but I don't think life experience with these.
No not okay, you can't look for Monica's presents!
Okay. So uh, Ross is kinda bummed huh?
Hey so, did uh, did she move out?
Ooh! Ahh, Pheebs, was gonna tell a story.
Hey! I'm sorry! That- where are you going?
See that is the problem with invisible dentists.
All right, let's show them how it's done.
Forget it! Okay, I'm not giving up the apartment.
OK Phoebs, how many do you want?
Hi. You guys have any wrapping paper?
You didn't bring me here to do that, did you?
No, no, you're right, it is a ridiculous name!
Yeah. Solid effort. Solid effort.
Well, y'know, you and me, it had to end sometime.
All right, then massage me up right nice!
What? Oh, yeah, I'm gonna be a junior copywriter.
So you're never actually going to pay me back?
Just tryin' somethin' here, ya know.
Oh my goodness! Where did you hide it?
I can't believe you'd want us to raise Emma.
Or we can do the actual telephone thing.
You told him to play the boxer gay!!
Just practicing. You're good. Carry on.
Wait! You look? You-you massaged me.
Ah, well no, it's just uh, me and Wendy.
Wait, wait! Wh-what are you doing here?
Well, it's official there are no good movies.
Oh no, now it's not gonna make any sense!
Then free as a bird. What's up?
Oh well, we don't because we got...the...other pl-place.
Oh, and I promise, I will not fake it this time.
I would never lie to get someone into bed.
People who've never ever been to Paris.
At least as long as I have the pants.
Just give us the cheapest room you have.
Laundry. Huh. Is that my new nickname?
...it was like the Algonquin kids table.
Pheebs! We have to take you to the hospital now!
Why would Monica be keeping Richard in here?
We're not gonna talk about girth are we?
Y'know, I knew something like this was going to happen.
Umm, not feeling better 'bout Malcom.
Again I must go back to, how?
Okay, ten blocks down. Five to go.
Well, don't, don't think me immodest, but, me?
People do stupid things when they're upset.
Ooh, this is a Dear Diary moment.
Whoa, whoa, prom night flashback.
Can you see my nipples through this shirt?
Rachel, I love you! Deal with me first!
Oooh! I hope you're happy too, honey!
Hey, you know who used to have nails like that?
'So Cheesy' also has an opening.
Well, it does not ring a bell with me...
You wanna see flirting? I'll show you flirting.
Hey that's okay. So, where do you want to go?
Ohh, umm, y'know what, I already ate.
I don't think that's what they were talking about Joe!!
This is Chandler Bing! This is Chandler Bing!
If I help, we can find 'em faster!
Oh nothing, we're just talking. Y'know, blah-blah-blah.
Wow, it's, it's like porno for clowns.
You are totally and completely 100% forgiven.
Y'don't think that makes me seem a little...
No, no, no, I don't, I don't really wanna play.
Look at us, we're a couple of couples!
Oh yeah, it was great. You should be a chef.
Well, thanks man. Now I can get my pony.
I am totally picturing you with all those women!
She must've been planning this for years!
I was making a coconut phone with the professor.
I'll give you a thousand dollars to talk to us.
Ugly Naked Guy got a Thighmaster!
Princess Leia in the gold bikini.
Well, that's impossible, can you check again, please?
Well, invisible kids can be that way sometimes.
What are you looking at me for? I didn't know that.
Oh, yeah, he's my... he's my best friend.
There's a tape here with Monica's name on it.
Why do you want to play this game so bad?
But nothing has to happen until your ready.
So you never had sex with a Kennedy, have you?
Anyway, err... I need to borrow some money.
... And where's this money coming from?
Y'know, I, I really don't think we need a canoe.
Yes it would. What do you say to $50?
What are you smiling about? What is so funny?
Knit, good woman, knit, knit!
I'm so tired. Yeah okay, but no foreplay.
Oh dear God, they gave us glasses!
Okay! Okay! Everybody down! Everybody down!
Yeah, I-I-I think so. Yeah, I-I think so...
Alright, you did it! Do we have any fruit?
Well, uh, Dr. Greene, where are you going?
Yeah, I don't you should say that even when you're healthy.
I know, I, I should have talked to you first about it.
Jeez, relax! It's not like we're mar-ah-ah!!
It's the semi-finals...of her...botchy ball tournament.
The ball is Janice. The ball is Janice.
Ah, you obviously saw my personal ad.
I have a job interview I have to get ready for.
No, I have a great idea for a present for her.
Well if people don't know they shouldn't just guess!
You're watching a football game at a funeral?
Oh come on, come on, it can't be that bad.
Oh that's so funny because we found someone too.
Oh, y'know, what did you mean when you said pivot?
It is. Did I... not tell you about her?
And thats the Chrysler Building right there.
Wait a minute! I have a date tomorrow night.
Do you want us to leave the room, or?
It is the softest hair! Touch it!
Yeah okay. Well, what's the next little bit?
And what does she have to think about? I love her!
No. He.....he's coming out of his shorts.
You don't owe me anything, I don't want you money...
Excuse, I seem to have dropped my ball.
So there is no good time to ask that question.
Well, it throws my WENUS out of whack.
Well, it sounds kinda stupid... Who's she?
He's finally happy with that and walks away.
Bermuda, Bahama, come on pretty mama...
Well, you remember Cathy Bates in Misery?
Looks like Joey is doing allright with her.
I can't believe it. Paolo kissed my mom?
I'm hangin in. . . and a little out.
I, I'm sorry, I uh I already have a roommate.
Right, fine, I'll do it, but no talking.
Well let's....let's see what everybody thinks of that?
Y'know I was thinking, what if I uh, unpack here?
Okay, are you aware unagi is an eel?
So uh, what's this thing you're auditioning for?
Well, yeah, but y'know, what-what if I was wrong?
Well, I think, I think Ross knows about me and Monica.
Well, You could, but... probably just the one time.
He's not snoozing, he's teaching a class.
Hey Joe! You wanna shoot some hoops?
When was the last time you saw her wear it?
Well, sure, but can you play it on a plane?
By the way, that fight was totally arousing.
Ross had a ring?! And he was gonna propose?
Please, please, please, don't be mad at me.
It's the theme from Good Will Humping.
Oh, you should live with Joey, Roll-os everywhere.
Our new fridge? I don't live here anymore.
Well, you can understand, given how we started.
: What do you need, what do you need?
Tell her, I'm allergic, and I will sue!
Whoa-whoa-whoa, what are we going to do about my job?
Actually, it pays nothing. It's an internship.
God why why would you want to do that to yourself!?
I would have to say that is an 'L'-shaped bracket.
He pulled a quarter out of my ear!
007?! This is James Bond's tux?!
Why is Phoebe singing to Carl Mulden?
Okay, it's just that dogs make me a little uncomfortable.
Oh come on Ross, I think we're all losers here.
How much did I love The King and I?
I'm sorry you're here with me instead of Roger.
Okay, I'll try. And you can't make any noise.
Well, yeah... 's'no Brian in Payroll.
Because you shouldn't be with him. You should be with me.
Open up! Open up! Open up!
No, I saw a picture of you covered in blueberries.
Hey Eddie, you uh, wanna play some foosball?
Honey, the tortilla chips know what you mean.
Right. So uh, have you written yours yet?
Looking for restaurant jobs for you in Tulsa.
So, Spock actually hugs his father?
Maybe I should quit and get a job that pays.
You couldn't have at least changed your shirt.
Well, it's good that you finally have a place to do that.
Awful. Awful. Couldn'ta gone worse.
Ohh! You guys gonna be living together again?
Yeah, you think so, well? Should I ask him?
Wow! That sandwich really does smell good.
Hey! Hi! You uh, ready to exchange gifts?
So Joey breaks my chair and I get nothing!
Joey, this is Die Hard 1 again.
Hardest thing I've ever done in my life.
I'm not crazy about babies. I'm crazy about us.
I can't believe this! What the hell were you thinking?
Yes, but haven't you wanted a kid like forever?
Well that would be nice. I'll go get the lotion.
And if not, we got to do it on a bucket.
Why did you take the shower curtain down?
Y'know you, really didn't have to take me to the airport.
Monica, I think you've gone over to the bad place.
Pete Becker. Pete... Is this him?
I'm still on London time, does that count?
Man, if only you'd gotten here sooner.
I tell people secrets. It makes them like me.
One more score to go! You can do it!
The tall girl who wouldn't sleep with you?
Stop it! We're doing this! Let's do it!
I'm sure it's somebody for you. Now, go hide.
And the moment of joy is upon us.
Did you make it, or are you just serving it?
So, what do you say? Can you get out of work?
So you kissed her, so what happened after that?
Hey, Monica? Can I ask you a cooking question?
Tuna or egg salad? Decide!
That's kind of a masculine name, don't you think?
Hey, buddy boy, how'd the audition go?
Okay, I don't sound like that. That is so not true.
So, who's up for a big game of Kerplunk?
It hurts me. It physically hurts me.
Do you realize you get louder each week?
Ok, let's do Julie. What's wrong with her?
You don't get a lot of 'doy' these days...
Okay, so now do you believe that she's attracted to me?
Okay. You were right. I'm in love with Joey's girlfriend.
Maybe that's because she's a minion of the anti-Christ.
I thought...maybe...you got me porn for Valentine's Day.
Hmm, let's see if it comes up this time.
Nice job Joe! You're quite the craftsmen.
What does a Wicked Wango card do?
Y'know, I sensed that I should stop. So we're okay?
Tell me it's "you and me" we.
Didn't you used to call it the Little Major?
It kills over one americans every year.
Who sold a story to Archie Comics?!
Ooh, I hate when my father calls me that.
I'll take this one too Uh ... Mommy?
Oh man! I am so excited-I may vomit!
Hey, stick a fork in me, I am done.
No you don't-get it in black, not brown.
So how's it going there in Financial Services?
Monica, I feel like you should have German subtitles.
Well, why don't you tell her to stop being silly!
Yeah, I don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet.
Jill says vestibule... I'm going with vestibule.
Okay, but that's, like, the easiest era.
Okay, don't say anything, you might scare it away.
Please tell me you know which one is our baby.
Oh yeah, me too, she's so cool and pretty.
Okay, but if he asks, I'm not going to lie.
Well, there you are! So what did Elizabeth say?
I'm gonna miss being able to afford food.
It is not okay that I'm aroused by this now.
Yes! You want babies! You have baby fever!
Okay, I gotta ask, who calls us that?!
I think it's great. Y'know, it's sweet, it's romantic...
Oh yeah. I'll take, I'll take your picture.
Yes... thank you. That was... that was....
I still can't believe they promoted her to lieutenant.
Why? This was supposed to be a temp job!
Oh wow! Is that what this all have been about?
Oh man, I am so sorry. Are, are you okay?
What are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing?
What does it look like I'm doing? I am cleaning!
Oh, come on. You told me about the last dream.
Hey! Everybody at work loved you last night!
Ahh yes, the messers become the messies!
Who cares? Nobody reads those things.
Wow! You are way to young to have seen that!
Or what my Father called Thursday night.
What!? They are totally ripping us off!
Just tell me what I need to do to make things right.
I can't believe there is a naked hooker in there!
And yet, she's still not hanging up the phone.
All this lying has been hard on us too.
Uhh, yes, absdolutely, um. Why again?
Pull my finger--My hand is messed up.
Yes, yes, but did you see who she was dating?
He paints quite a picture doesn't he?
What are you, what are you gonna show me my clothes?
Oh that's great, with my luck, that's gonna be him.
We heard you play all the way from your apartment!
I'd be sad sure, but I wouldn't cry.
I think that's the youngest girl ever to reject me.
Do you have any beers? We're out of beers.
How long it took to go back in the water?
Oh, well someone left this . This is yours?
Oh god, I have to tell you something. You're not pregnant.
I thought you were showing me how much you mean to me.
Ok, good night. You big freak of nature.
Like finding money with naked people on it!
Suddenly I wish I was reading my own name.
That's how radio stars escape stalkers.
Okay, you know, you know when your in bed, with a woman.
Hey, listen, why don't we go change in my room?
I can't take the big white dog! You love it!
Oh, it's so hard to care when you're this relaxed.
Mr. D, hows it going, sir?
No, she's still upset because I saw her boobies.
Hello Phoebe, I've been thinking about you all day.
Yes, if the foxhole was lined with sandwiches.
Monica! This is the Men's room! Isn't it?
Okay, umm, we all have to play strip poker.
We think he was trying to spell out 'MONKEY.'
Maybe he's calling to say your obsessive and crazy.
We came over as soon as we saw.
Sorry, we're on a major flan high.
Well, it certainly worked for that Valdez kid.
Well, this is fascinating. So, uh, what is it about me?
Don't you have to be Claymation to say stuff like that?
Maybe the problem was you were pronouncing it kara-tay.
Yeah, she's dying... Of a cough apparently.
All right fine! But I'm only doing this for you!
Well, then, I might as well offer to stay.
Good idea. Where do you want to go to lunch?
Well get rid of her, obsessive and shrill.
Why? Do you another boyfriend in there or something?
Oh, so you're already doing your part for the kids.
So um, Mary-Angela, what's your second favorite?
Y'know, sometimes that fake out thing is just mean!
In a minute? What's gonna happen in a minute?!
Well, does that mean that you're not going to wearing yours?
Uh Kathy, with K or a C?
Hey, that monkey's got a Ross on its ass!
To my best bud. Thanks best bud.
Right! I just think that this is happening too soon.
Did your Dad ever dress up like Santa?
Oh that's all right, I have it memorized. It's 1A.
Come on, he won't even know what they mean.
Is it wrong that I was totally aroused by that?
Then you distract her with a Barbie doll.
Me, that guy who just said butt cracks?
Well, I'm not really in a sexy mood right now.
Oh that's all right sir, and that's just one girl.
Wow! Fortunately she has a very pretty face!
Angela's the screamer, Andrea has cats.
Yeah, yeah, it's just that with my last roommate Kip...
Oh, I have to get married in James Bond's tux!
And we're done with the chicken fried rice.
Yeah, she seemed cool, attractive. I'll do it.
Ahh, just like the apothecary tables of yore...
We're just hanging out by the spoons. Ladle?
Where's Joey? His mom's on the phone.
Yeah, Jell-o just like Mom used to make.
Yeah, just think of it as $25 per room!
Woah, woah, I've put on a little weight?
So you're just, kinda rubbing it on yourself?
No, no, you got zero points for 'IDNEY'.
No, I think we're just blurry shapes to him now.
Too many jokes... must mock Joey!
You sure you don't wanna stick around a little longer?
It's kinda a ah, a third nipple kinda thing.
No, just wanna make sure we're on the same page.
See that'll stop when you pick up the phone.
Run! Run you crazy, rich freak!
Well I've forgotten what it tastes like okay?!
Well, you got here just in time. I really have to go buddy.
Ahhhh-gaaaahhh. Eddie what're you still doin' here?
Oh, ahh, no thanks, I just had an M&M.
Hey, I had a terrible childhood and I don't do porn.
Oh, I'm fine about my problem now, by the way.
Is that gal pal spelled L-O-S-E-R?
So, you stole my joke, and you stole my money.
Please don't do that again, it's a horrible sound.
Hi sweetie. So, what was with all the whispering?
Batman has Robin! We get ESPN right?
Sweet mother of all that is good and pure.
Joe, I don't think this is going to be your big break.
Hey! Oh, good, Ross! You're parents like me, right?
Honey, there are like 20 tickets on the nightstand!
Turns out they can't fire me. Because I quit.
Yeah, big zero gravity moon steps.
'Look, Gippetto, I'm a real live boy.'
Hi! We're checking out of the bridal suite.
Really? Struck down in the pribe of libe!
Well, I'm guessing uh, tonight at the coffee house.
Isn't that what happened with you and the bride's maid?
Oh, just a bit of shopping. How've you been?
Hey, check out that girl! She is really hot!
Yes, apparently Stevie and the band are like this.
So, are you really gonna go out with that nurse man?
Well, you could also give back the money you owe me.
Yeah I even got a ring. Did you get a ring?
It must take you forever to find your keys.
Ladies? Ross's speech is in 45 minutes.
Phase Three! I just achieved Phase Three!
If we do that, we gotta get Die Hard.
Ohhh Oh no, wait a minute, I have no one.
Our kids are gonna be fat aren't they.
Well that's not fair, you've already had some!
That's awesome! That's great! What made you do it?!
Yes! And that's why I'm under the table. Celebrating.
Ross! It's got your wavy black lines!
He's not gonna make it, he's stuck in Chicago.
Well, I try to y'know, squeeze things. Are you okay?
Well, I told you not to walk. Here. There. Okay.
I think you played the Gunther card too soon.
Forget what I said, I was babbling! Pick me!
I couldn't find anything at Joey--Hey-hey, oh hey!
Y'know, I'm so glad I picked you to help me with this.
Hey, hey, those guys are takin our stuff!
Kids, new dream... I'm in Las Vegas.
Ok, think, what would Jack and Chrissy do?
Pheebs, wake up and smell the restraining order.
But those are the words! Those exact words!
Well we could just stay in and cook for ourselves.
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!!
Why do they put so much steam in there?!
Not exactly. . . I'm wearin panties.
All right! I'm putting it out, I'm putting it out.
Phoebe is going to say "yes"? That's, that's great!
Oh honey, leave them alone, they're in love.
No, I don't think that's the kinda thing they're looking for.
Ok honey. that was close. -Cut to Rachel.
Really?! I didn't think girls ever just wanted a fling.
I missed most of the party Charlie's a girl, right?
See, maybe that's the one we should've actually hidden.
Or a job where you don't have to carry a table.
Ahh, you know what? That is....Who wouldn't want you?
How can I answer that when I'm pretending I don't know you?
Ahh, no thanks. No chicken, bye-bye then.
Hi, could we get two burritos to go, please?
He's the headliner of a gay burlesque show.
Get ready to run. Congratulations on your wedding.
Oh, no no no, she took off with my clothes.
Monica got ice in her eye, and it hurts.
You look amazing. I'm the luckiest man in the world.
So, thanks for having me over! Rach. Pheebs.
I'll see you guys later, I gotta go...do a thing.
That's fast math! We could use you in Tulsa.
I don't know what it is, I just can't take a good picture.
Bit country? C'mon in here you roomie.
I am only one man! Okay Ross, time is up!
Hey Eddie. Daahh!! What're you doin' here?
Oh yeah, then uh, what was Phoebe's song about?
Buy it for ya, or win it for ya?
I know it's tough now, but things will get better.
There was no fish when she dropped it off.
Ahh, so how many cameras are actually on you?
Yeah, yeah, she works over at that place, uh...
Okay, but after that, we're shootin' some pool.
Yeah, she couldn't live without the Chan Love.
Okay, let me just straighten out your helmet there.
I was in charge of the cameras! Gift shop?
No-no, I mean what, what's this about your new place?
I didn't know you and Carol were getting divorced, I'm sorry.
Yeah, see, I can't pull of baby-doll can I?
Oh I'm so sorry man! Is there anything I can do?
Your computer, I don't know wha... everything's gone!
No, you keep the pack. I'm all cried out today.
Okay! So, what do you girls have planned for tonight?
Me and Frank and Phoebe, Graduation 1965.
You still haven't told Rachel you weren't really proposing?
Okay, from now on, you don't get to talk to other people.
Okay, you guys spend waaaay too much time together.
I am sorry, moment to make fun of that, please!
Yes! You mean the world the world to me. Oh...
Yes. Hey, can I ask you, is Eddie a little...
At least let me smoke it to the good part.
Oh, I'm taking my ex-girlfriend of my speed dialer.
Out of curiosity, what is your secret ingredient?
Don't worry about it. I'm taking care of it tonight.
And you left the toilet seat up, you bastard.
Why? Okay? Why? Wh-wh-why did that have to happen?
No,... no... NO! Look, I'm, I'm married!
Oh, he works in the Fine Foods division.
Oh, yeah? What happened when we played last time?
Hey, why don't you wear those earrings I gave you?
No, you don't have to, and you can't because I live here too.
Oh yes, yes... let me... take your coat.
What's the matter with me? Why I'm such a girl?
But it's all so overwhelming. I don't know where to start.
Okay. Okay, now wait a minute that was totally different.
Oh my God! Someone's killed Square Man!
Six-hour trip to London. That's a lot of Monica.
Oh that's so sweet! I want to show you something too!
Bing doesn't seem so weird now, does it?
So do you think uh, Joey's more charming than me?
Authorization? I don't need that. I'm gonna put everything back.
Phoebe found your pregnancy test in the trash.
When you're marrying us; that's what you should say.
Seriously sir, my brains? All over the wall.
So ah, isn't a bit cold out for shorts?
Hey, how'd it go? How'd she like the gift?
Yes you did! Admit it! You freaked out!
Oh, I would never bet this apartment. It's too nice.
Hey, what do I know? I wanted to get a bigger gorilla.
Hey, shut up!! You're not my real Mom!!
Well it wouldn't kill you to say it once in a while.
Honey, try to focus the trash talk on him!
Sorry. I'm sorry. Y'know what, we're just gonna throw it.
Ahh, do you have any coconut flavoured deities?
We have to leave for New York in an hour.
Are you suggesting we dance our troubles away?
Yeah. Oh it's not warm yet, we still have time.
I messed up. Okay? I'm sorry, I really messed up.
Oh and Ross was like what? A lion tamer?
Did she see us yet? Did she see us?
So umm, you-you flirt with guys all the time?
What are doing? You know I can only dish it out!
Okay. You have to stop the Q-tip when there's resistance!
Worst porn ever! Worst porn ever!
To yourself. Hey-hey-hey, y'know what that's pretty good.
You're gonna put on sweats and clean, aren't you?
Uh honey, I know you don't like to relinquish control...
Wow, in 45 minutes you can find her twice.
Oh, would you say this was the most upset you could be?
No, it's suicide. The man's got an egg.
Ahh, I think it just moved. It's really poking me.
Yes, Janice. Why is that so difficult for you to comprehend?
The Velveteen Rabbit was brown and white!
Y'know, I-I can't really put a price on that Joe.
So those were pity laughs? PITY LAUGHS?
She'll love it. Go with the egg, my friend.
Oooh that may be a New World's record
OK, is there a mute button on this woman?
It's like a baby caterpillar chasing its mama!
Those are book ends! That's a great gift!
I can't even believe this! I really come off that badly?
How can I dump this woman on Valentine's day?
Well it you don't know that, then I don't want to do this with you.
Oh right, your allergies. All her, she hates you.
Whoa-whoa, wait a minute, did you say, you love her?
All right, well I'm gonna put my sweats back on.
Oh uh well tomorrow's no good for her either.
So is your apron. You're wearing it like a cape.
Okay. I just wanted them to hear it from somebody else.
It bodes well for me that speed impresses you.
I didn't know you were taking a class. That is so cool.
Okay! That's a four! And where-where's the other one?
Well, that's not true, he-he smacked you once.
Just coffee! Where are we gonna hang out now?
Yes, I know, but her friend sounds like such a...
Next time you snore, I'm rolling ya over!
If I'm goin' down, I'm takin' everybody with me.
Okay. Okay. What are you gonna do to me if you get the part?
Don't worry honey, we'll make yours funnier.
I just don't see why those two can't work things out!
Monica's all upset, because I sent Clunkers away.
Look, we just think that maybe she's being a little unreasonable.
I can do that, I've had 30 years of practice.
Listen, they are really great. If you just got a chance...
Oh that's great, my friend Joey's in the movie business.
Well she's, she's the kinda girl-Joey was unconscious.
Don't try to make me uncomfortable with feminine stuff!
Uh yes, but uh, I just watch it for the articles.
Well, you still havent taken down the Christmas lights.
It's so good I don't know what I've done to deserve it!
I am not working. There's not much to do around here!
All right, look! Look. I think I can explain this.
Yeah, me too. Look, I'll just get my old job back.
That's weird. I don't think my boss likes me either.
That was not a security blanket! That was a wall-hanging!
Yeah, ah, ah . . . I'll think of something.
I'm sorry. If you ask me, I'd move in with him.
And no one touches the air around the TV!
I like it in the stern. ...of the boat. Hello.
I messed up, it was a meeting, everybody was smoking.
Well, whatever it is, I hope it involves winking.
Hey, what are you doing here? Shouldn't you be at work?
Oh, beautiful? Really? Beautiful? You think this is beautiful?
Uh-uh, yes. I would like to see that ring please.
Look, this isn't funny! You get back here right now!
Pudo aver sido General Tso!
Well, you don't you have Captain Hook explain it to her.
Yeah well, too bad we're gonna have to return them.
Who did you originally want to hook up with?
Well y'know, things are different. I'm...I'm married now.
Scared me out of ever wanting to live with him.
Which I may say, right now, is out of control.
Boy did we make friends with the wrong sister!
Yes, yes, we did, thanks to Vidal Buffay.
What a great apology! And you accept! Okay, bye-bye!
No, that's all right. I just had a jar of mustard.
Don't listen to him, he's in a really bad mood!
Okay, I'm a rookie. I should not be in the end zone.
I fear a jury will see it the same way!
I know, let's rest and drink lots of fluids.
Yes I'm gonna put it back exactly where I found it.
Now, it's not wrapped because I just, just finished it.
Guys are signing over their 401-K's to me?
I was just trying to bring a little culture to the group.
Nah, Phoebs, that's the guy that comes in the frame.
As we all are at some point during the day.
Are you sure?! Because our guy smells incredible!
You'll be perfect for this! That's already your name!
Hey, I may have no money, but I still have my pride.
I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name. Paul, was it?
Yeah, I'm kinda wishing everyone wasn't here right now.
Wow, there's my fantasy come true. No, seriously.
Excuse me, Doug? Hey there sports fan!!
Ahh, Gepeto, $5,000 dollars? Are you insane?
No. No I'm just tired. Y'know, from-from the walk.
And I just realized I can sleep with my eyes open.
So you don't get paid unless the movie makes money?
Yeah I know, we're losing Ross, Joey said hence...
Look I never should have kissed your girlfriend, but I'm...
Cry?! I just found a talking puppy, I'm rich!
Well, I'm sure you get another one at Ann Taylor's.
Okay, listen, how far am I gonna have to go with her?
Yes, that is cool. Because I have models here y'know......never.
I see, I see, y-y-you're trying to freak me out.
Wow! Pregnancy does give you some weird cravings.
Im just trying to find the right moment, you know?
Yeah, come on, it's Ross and Rachel, they've got too.
Well y'know, what if she didn't actually sleep with the guy?
Aww, turkey! Aww, giving thanks! Aww!
Yeah, here, somewhere else, y'know where-where ever.
You know what's not funny? Male Pattern Baldness.
Look, she's not backing down! She went like this!
Pheebs, we're not giving you a deposit for our wedding!
Did you see our bank statement? Can this be right?
Yeah, at least you hid your feelings well about it.
This is ridiculous, he's not gonna hold his breath...
Oh, sweet Lord. New realms of pleasure!
Yes, but the coffee table doesn't match the...blahebdmsdlkhdyslkd;btyds...Rooosss!!!!
Well, why does she not want to hang out with us?!
Janice, I'm sorry but umm, you can't stay here tonight.
This isn't your first surprise party, is it sir?
Wow!! Can Joey and I put them on and fight?
No-no-no-no, this is bad! It's bad! This is bad!
I love the specifics, the specifics were the best part!
I mean, you were the most beautiful woman in the room tonight!
Is this why they don't like me or why you don't like me?
Because it's flattering! Come on Monica! Come on Monica!
And you don't think taking care of our chick is work?
I have the lung capacity of a two year old.
Making chocolate milk. Do you want some?
You got a man who's a nanny...? You got a manny...?
Okay, well I won't uh, worry about this anymore then.
Yes, and we call Ross Lingers In The Bathroom.
I suppose that Monica will have the ... manipulative shrew.
Phebes, it was your birthday, like, months ago.
Oh, y'know-y'know what, I was looking at it upside down.
Oh Jeez honey, I thought, I thought you were asleep.
Yeah, well, good luck trying to top the last one.
That's really not the kind of thing we are looking for Zack.
Well, that's pretty much all I'm looking for from these people.
I shouldn't even bother coming up with a line, right?
How can he do that? Didn't you sign a lease?
She gets crazy! This scar is from Pictionary!
Blue blazer back. He-he wants it back.
So uh, man, are you gonna go to the play with me tonight?
If that doesn't keep kids in school, what will?
Wow! That ripped! That ripped real nice!
That thing that I have to do to make a baby. I faked it.
Was his question what's more boring than him?
Oh don't forget, my office holiday party is tonight.
Yeah, is this your pretty pink pillow on the couch?
Oh yeah! Okay, let's play again. What do you got?
What are you guys? Like a gang or something?!
Well then, how do you know when vegetables are done?
Okay, give me a second! Did you clean up in here?
Do you know me or are you just really good at this game?
Fun Bobby? Your ex-boyfriend Fun Bobby?
They're terrific, and they live right here in the city.
I wouldn't brag too much about that thing, big guy.
Well, it's, it's yummy. So Mary-Angela do you like it?
I wasn't doing anything. Uh-oh, what did she do now?
Honey, are you seriously ever gonna wear the boots again?
You like the Purple Rain display! Hey Bob.
Well y'know a lot of those Muppets don't have thumbs.
With Roger? Not just with Roger?! Oh my God!
Uh, excuse me? Could you take a picture of us?
Well, what's the deal with these? These-these look nice.
You're right, I have no excuses! I was totally over the line.
That was so unlikely. Well, let's get married! I guess.
Well now you have two. Hey, I am good at math.
Yes indeedy! With a beautiful view of...
Do we have any... Do we have any thoughts here?
Well, I'm, I'm sorry... Ahhh. Have we met?
Wow! You look just like your son Mrs. Tribbiani!
No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no!!! You can't come in here! R-r-r-r-Ross is naked.
She's not as pretty as she was when she was 29.
I see. Y'know umm, Phoebe makes sock bunnies.
Joey got meat sauce on the banister again!
Yeah, well, don't expect that to happen anytime soon!
Hello? Oh, uh, Rachel, it's the Visa card people.
Let me think. Let me think-Oh! I don't care.
It is a crime that you and I don't spend more time together.
I got caught up and work, but I'm quitting tomorrow.
Okay, when are we gonna tell Rachel what is actually gonna happen?
It's okay, I want this to be your night too. To Monica.
Come on! I was there! I know he's the love of your life.
Uh-Oh. It's Isaac Newton, and he's pissed.
Good job Joe! Well done! Top notch!
Yeah. Oh no wait, I'm not an nine-year-old girl.
So? What? What? They're gone! Monica's gonna freak!
I'm gonna say this for the last time. Would you please just...
Yes, it's working! Why isn't she calling me back?
Before we go out there I've got a present for ya.
That's great, but shouldn't you be on the toilet right now?
Y'know, I was thinking about ah, asking her for her number.
Okay, I'm gonna go to the bathroom. Will you watch my phone?
Well okay Jerry, thanks for stopping by.
Well, the heart wants what it wants. I'll see you later.
Okay, there's something different though--Oh my God! You smoked!
Yes, you got something from the Screen Actor's Guild.
Oh really, I didn't know they had foosball in the 1800's.
Oh-no, y'know with Gandolf we'd be out all night!
So, the ebola virus. That's gotta suck, huh?
So, we'll do the rest of the bills later then?
I can see it now, "Look dad, it's the Sphinx!"
Okay, did you see that?! With the inappropriate and the pinching!!
It could've been worse, he could've shot her.
Take whatever you want, just please don't hurt me.
I have to! Okay? It's time! Okay, I hate dogs.
Oh no-no-no I was just squinting. That doesn't mean anything.
Hey, how 'bout it? You, me, Saturday night?
That's a little more relaxed than you want them to get.
Tell us what happened, Brown Bird Ross.
Hey! Can you take a duck and a chick to the theatre?
I can't call her, I left a message! I have some pride.
Did you have a crush on me, when you first met me?
Okay, here you go. I have two queens, what do you have?
Well, thank God your livelihood doesn't depend on it.
Honey I... I love your breasts the way they are!
Honey! That's crazy! I don't want you to get me a stripper...
Well, I-I thought I did but, I-I guess I did not!
See, I'm not bad at this fixing up thing, huh?
Well, my apartment isn't there anymore, because I drank it.
No-no, I don't think you heard me. Are you ready to party?!
I saw you checking me out during the game last night.
Oooh, Rich is goin' to the party too, huh?
No no no... I mean, why? why is she here??
You mean the guy who kept staring at your chest?
Oh the phone! The phone's making sounds! Hello!
Yeah, fine. Fine. Not perfect!! But good enough.
I'm not saying it was a good idea, I'm saying I snapped!
My God! He wants to do it with Phoebe in London!
That's why I lost my toe?! Because I called you fat?!
Dum! Dum-dum-dum! Dum! Dum! Dum! Dum-dum-dum!
The mean guys at the coffee house took my hat.
Hey! This is where your hyper-organized-pain-in-the-ass stuff pays off!
Oh, it's nothing, it's a little thing... I hate that guy.
Listen, I'm, I'm sorry I didn't make it over there today.
Well, you must be pretty mad at yourself right now...!
Look, you have done enough! Okay? You have to stop this now.
What kind of scary-ass clowns came to your birthday?
Oh no problem, maybe I'll play with my left hand.
Look, I'm sorry. Okay? I'm weak, and pathetic, and sorry.
Yeah, I believe I was talking to Joey, alright there, Mother-Kisser?
You are gonna be a huge star! I'm gonna hug ya!
Why haven't you told them?! Wouldn't they be happy?!
It's okay. Go take the test and see if we're okay.
Ah. Your own brand of vigilante justice.
Sense the tone! No that kid Nate got it.
Okay listen, just give me anything I can make two of.
Hey, there's two messages. These could be from work!
Well, listen, this has been great but I'm officially wiped.
I'll be a fool for you. I'm sure, you know I don't mind.
That's it?! I gave up my Disneyland story for that?
Oh yes, somebody just said, "Can you hear anything?"
Don't touch the computer. Don't ever touch the computer.
Yeah, I ended up in the storage room, and not alone.
All right, so who do you got it narrowed down to?
Hey, you just wanna forget about raquetball and hang out here?
Yeah, I'm not gonna pay for those acting classes anymore.
All right look. Penis schmenis. We're all people.
Right. Right. Well ah, y'know we could flip for it.
That's the magic story you use when you wanna have sex!
Y'know what? You can say goodbye to the tan ones.
Weirder than watching his two moms make out?
C'mon, we're roommates! My eyes!! My eyes!!
Come on, it was like cousins having sex up there!
no I'm not quite sure you got the right movie that's all.
Joey, if I go first, I wanna be looking for my keys.
Oh! Look at that, time's up! My turn!
Yes you did! You look happy and sick; you smoked!
Dee, the sarcastic sister from Whats Happening.
Well let me think about that, while I remove my pants!
I'm out of words. Should I just say the whole thing again?
Were you so late because you were burring this woman?
Okay, now let's decide who has the nicest ass.
Okay, ah umm, ah, a 8. Ah, a 6?
There just don't happen to be any women in our games.
I guess. It's always gonna be scary when we have a baby.
Then I look down, and I realize there's a phone... there.
I had sex today. I never have to answer that phone again.
Oh yeah! Yeah! Don't worry about me, I'll be fine!
No, I'm not mocking you, or you beautiful guest room.
Excuse me little one, I have a very solid backhand.
Look there is no way you're doing this wedding now. Okay?
Easy for you to say; you'll be wearing a veil.
And may-maybe we could end up on a boat again?
I don't know, it's these new shoes, they're all slippery.
Y'know that is a popular opinion today I must say.
He has sex, and we get hit in our heads.
So ah, your first sexual experience was with a woman?!
Just tell her the truth! Tell her you're not ready.
This sounds like a hernia. You have to-you-you-Go to the doctor!
Wow! Why do you want to get rid of her so badly?
Oh my God that's it, that's the ring! How much is it?
Y'know what maybe it's gonna be okay, I mean it's been a week.
We used them as pillows when we went camping.
All right, how about we, how 'bout we sell it.
Well, I guess thats why they call it psychology, sir.
I gotta check out this hot girl! There she is!
Weirdest thing. Did I hear--Mother of God it's true!
Yes! Chandler Bing, 7! Chandler Bing, 0.
Great, at a hundred dollars an apple, we're there!
Noo! Oh, it's okay, it's okay, baby, baby, baby.
Oh, that's cool. Then I'll just bring them both over.
Are they end to end, or tall like pancakes?
Twenty percent is a pretty generous tip Joe.
Still terrified, I'll take care of it. No problem.
You know, I'm not sure a sports team is the way to go.
I don't see any uh, cabs. Maybe we should just walk?
A place where no one will ever get out alive?
Bob. Bob! Bob!!! What the hell are you doing?!
Well, of course I do! My good friend Joey over here.
Okay, well, it's definite, two more weeks of winter.
Yeah, well, I guess you don't need my help Victor Victoria!
Is that supposed to be funny! I was really worried over here!
No... no! And yet it did. Good-bye, Janice.
This is great! Helen, could you come in here for a moment?
Does anyone else think David Copperfield is cute?
Wow, you're, you're right. I have a horrible, horrible name.
She's right, you shouldn't have bought tickets just for us ...
Yeah! You graduated Magma Ku Laude, right?
Yeah, you got me. I'm out five big ones! Here you go.
It still wouldn't be clean. All I want is my freedom.
Yes, and we'd appreciate it if no one told him yet.
Hey, you cry every time somebody talks about Titanic!
Listen, I've got a secret for ya. I let him win.
You know, we don't really take advantage of living in the city.
Does South Oregon have a sports-team? There you go.
Are you sure he's gonna be able to crack that code?
Here you go. Now stop bringing us pizzas you.
Be right there sweetums. A totally different situation.
I just get mad when Rachel doesn't remember where we're going.
Does this mean we're gonna have to start paying for coffee?
Right, right. Sometimes you guys just burst into flames.
Honey, she keeps canceling on us, take the hint.
Oh it's Bing, sir. I'm sorry , I was just ah...
Why can't we talk in here? With, with, witnesses.
What? Are you kidding? That was like 16 years ago.
Not that big a deal? There...there was touching of things.
I spent the entire day with you, why didn't you tell me?!
Guys, guys, I've got great news! Guess what.
Why are you in here if Joshua is all the way over there?
Okay uh, for now, temporarily, you can call me, Clint.
I always knew you were gonna make it. I'm so proud of you.
Okay. Holy double-vented comfort Batman! What's this?
Horrifying? Scarring? Something people go to jail for?
No. I'm not letting you or anybody else see, ever.
I was just telling Joey about the opening in Fleischman's group.
Oh relax man, relax. You're looking a little flushed.
The cameras? Remember last night I told you to take them?
Hey, what time is it? The big game is about to start!
25J and K, any chance those aren't together?
Oh no-no-no-no-no-no, vomit tux! No-no, vomit tux!
During this time...are you, are you still my best man?
Well, I-I still think you're very-very nice and very pretty...
Oh yes you can. You just make the faces and the noises.
You ah, you have, you have to leave, now? How come?
No, you don't have to, and you can't because I, I live here too.
Believe me, I've been saying that for years. Oh my God!
I'm sorry buddy, but I don't think I'm gonna be able to make it.
That's a mailman! That's our mailman! Hi. How are ya?
Okay, everybody stay here. I will find out what's going on.
So Rachel's all moved out huh? How are you taking it?
Ya know I think this is much better than the coffee house.
Things sure have changed here on Waltons mountain.
What if Mary-Angela comes to the door and I ask for Mary-Angela?
Uch, do you think, Monica is gonna be able smell it?
Oh, come on! I don't care! Come on! Whose is it?
Oh no-no-no, you-yeah, of course you get to be my best man.
Tonight? You-you didn't say it was going to be at nighttime.
I never sucked, I actually didn't want you to know how good I was!
And basically, that's how a bill becomes a law.
Go and tell Rachel right now before Ross finds out.
Well, maybe I won't kiss you, and then you'll have to stay.
Y'know what, I'm gonna uh, play the field just a little more.
Okay, we have our stripper. A miss Crystal Chandelier.
Yeah. So do we need to hug here or. . .
Actually, I think this apartment sullies the good name of crap
Yeah, this more than anything else, is the staging area.
Yeah! Why don't you stick around. You can sit right there.
I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done.
So, are you guys in the movie, or are you just really paranoid.
Someone I don't know sent me an e-mail and I opened it.
That is funny. It was also funny when I made it up.
Oh, why not. Was I doing anything particularly... saucy?
Great! Now, the score is 7 to almost 7.
I'll try to stop. Wait, did you say until the sixth?
Well, never say never but y'know probably uh yeah, never.
Okay! Now you stay out here, and you think about what you did!!
What is the point of having them if we never use them?
Well, Monica and Chandler can't go. We're going to dinner remember?!
I dunno, but.. I think it's about to attack the Enterprise.
Well, that is what happened, and I don't even see you denying this!
No! That was a lie! See how easy that was?
I don't think the contestants are supposed to speak to each other.
Just out of curiosity did she tell you how you're gonna go?
Well, bye Mon, bye Ross, Rachel, bye Emma!
Yeah, but Sebastian? What is that? A cat's name?
Well, how could anyone not be in love with Yasmine Blepe?
I have to; he's my best friend, and you're seeing him.
Yes, yes it is, short story, that I was writing.
Oh, come on! You've been acting strange all day!
My Grandmother used to say that exact same thing to me.
Yes, Gunther, can I get two cups of chino, please?
What's wrong? What's wrong? You're married that's what's wrong.
I'm a little bit uncomfortable with the that way you express yourself.
Oh, I am no women, but that is one tasty dish.
You kissed my best Ross! ...Or something to that effect.
Yeah! Anderson just scored again! There's no Anderson.
Phoebe Buffay In Buffay The Vampire Layer.
So um, how come you guys haven't talked about this before?
So what do you say, maybe sometime I hold your gun?
All right, let's play one more hand! One more!
Wax the door shut, we're never leaving, ever.
Yes! I've-I've never seen a roll like this in my life!
This teramisu is, is excellent. Did you make it Mary-Angela?
I know that one! ...No, that's Popes into a Volkswagen.
Yes, and this with the cigarette butt in it, is that decaf?
I could use the money; it could give me time to write.
Wow, y'know when you say it, it doesn't sound so scary.
And you're upset because you didn't make your best friend cry?
Well, I think you need to come out of your shell just a little.
This is so sad. I mean, I only have like ten pins.
No-no-no-no, the game's not over, we're just switching teams.
Yes, if the presents are hidden south for the winter.
Okay, so what name am I cool enough to pull off?
Well, you're not gonna believe this, but if you have seven minutes...
Bye bye Mike!/Cya mike!/Bye mike!/Bye bye now!
Ross, don't press send, don't press se... !
This ice cream tastes like crap by the way.
Yes it is! From now on, I have no first name.
Y'know what, I think this might be one of the times he's wrong.
You were not supposed to hear that! I said that behind you back!
Hi, I'm Chandler, and I have no idea who Dorothy is.
Ah, Sliced Bread, a wonderful Lady MacBeth.
So, just the ones gave back to us and we had framed!
Uh, let's see... Alvin... Simon... Theodore.... no.
No-no-no-no, if we let her stay, she will stay forever!
What's this in my pocket? Why it's Joey's porno movie.
"So how does it feel knowing you're about to die?"
Top of the world? Dock of the bay? I'm out.
If can invade Poland, there isn't anything I can't do.
Aren't you supposed to be at an audition for another hour?
Oh, that's good. Maybe he'll hear you and pull the cord.
Well, I'm gonna get another espresso. Can I get you another latte?
No! Look, I don't cry! It's not a big deal! Okay?!
Okay. What if we lived together and you understand what I'm saying?
Ok, there is one more way to say it, who knows it?
Have you figured out what started the fire Mr. Fireman?
No, no, Phoebs. You know why? Cause he's dead.
Oh-ho, it'll be back. Oh-ho, there's nobody in the room.
And this from the cry-for-help department. Are you wearing makeup?
No. When it comes to sweets, he's surprisingly strict.
Hey, guys, it's after midnight, merry Christmas everyone.
Wait! Wait! We'd really love it if you could be there.
Yeah, well, I guess they had a fight, and he got drunk....
Ross is smart and funny, d'you ever think that about him?
New haircut? Necklace? Dress? Boots? Boots!
OK, I was wrong, that's what they used to cover Connecticut.
Y'know what I just realized? You just freaked out about our relationship.
I snapped, okay? I couldn't handle the pressure and I snapped.
You see you can't tell which one is which either, dwha!!
You-you-you didn't know that. Well, I guess my work here is done!
Are you sure you weren't looking at your hands in a mirror?
Yeah? I hope you're not thinking about cleaning the living room.
And I'll be using his dead body as a shield.
I don't know R.G., I was thinking something girlie for your office.
So-If you wear that you'll make mine less special.
"Wanted. Female roommate, non-smoker, non-ugly." Nice!
Uh, four, a boy, twin girls and another boy.
You know what? I'm not gonna end up like this. I'll see you man.
I'm in the bathroom, can you come in here? I think there's something wrong.
Hey, relax I just need more time. We're going to dinner tonight.
Okay Ross has the cameras, has he checked out yet?
That's a bad duck!!! How'd the thing go tonight, Ross?
Really?! Joe? What would you do if you were in Ross's situation?
Well, have you guys made anything that maybe I can take credit for?
Yes, but, Ross you chose a career of talking about dinosaurs.
All right, but I should warn you, I'm not going. I'm going.
No. We were in the middle of sex...and you fell asleep.
You know, it's very hard to take you seriously when you look like that.
Op, foot in a puddle, foot all in a puddle.
As in Barbara Streisand's husband James Brolin?
Because I'm very happy for him! And you, you lucky dog!
Wow that was my scariest voice! You're very brave.
Okay y'know what, because you said that, I'm not putting out tonight.
There are snow cones! Snow cones! Yuck!
I turned it off. Mother of God, I turned it off!
Hey-hey! I thought Naked Thursday's was just our thing man!
Nude... ... pictures of Anna Kournikova. I'm so sorry.
Good, God's speed, good people! You're not gonna go?
Oh, I'm glad you guys are past that little awkward phase.
Oh no-no-no, Monica would freak. But to hell with that bitch.
She's shhing me! It's my phone and she's shhing me!
Okay, open ours next. Open ours next!
Well, as long as the pilgrims didn't eat it, I'm in.
Can you hold on a moment? I have another call. I love her.
Julie hi! Chandler Bing, I, I guess you remember me.
Alright, I hope you realize you're not getting these underpants back.
You roll another hard eight and we get married here tonight.
I am really sorry. That is so terrible. I am so, so sorry.
You're right, it has been you dream for over 15 seconds.
Okay, so, I'm in Las Vegas... I'm Liza Minelli-
Oh really?! You think you're stronger? Why don't you prove it?
Y'know when we move in together, can I get a gumball machine?
The sheer volume, it was like flying with the Riddler!
Well she, she wouldn't do that, she's with, she's with me.
No! No-no-no-no-no-no. It sounds like they really need you down there.
You know that thing, when you and I talk to each other about things?
Yeah, Monica doesn't like that either, Maybe I should stop doing that.
No. No. Actually I forgot, what is the deal with that again?
...in you, my endless love. My endless love.
I might have checked to see if I was ovulating a couple times.
It's like 'Night of the Living Dead Christmas Trees.'
Yes! Two thousand dollars exactly! How do you know that!
What, Ethan? He got to spend the whole day with you!
And don't get me started on the way that people from Tulsa talk.
Yeah, that's the same as "it has something to do with wind".
Okay, okay, so we get to take that stupid troll thing home!
He's coming into the audience. He's coming into the audience.
Hey. Soaps? Shampoos? Are you really taking all this stuff?
Yes we're all in here and we would love for you to join us!
You'll have to pardon my roommate, he wanted to marry this.
You're not, what do you, what do you got a bionic foot?
This sounds like a hernia. You have to-you-you go to the doctor!
Well, aren't we Mr. "The glass is half empty."
Are we gonna talk about what you guys did last night? Or...
Hey, look at this. "My Big Book of Grievances."
Well, y'know, most women would kill for three guys like us.
But I made you a tape of what I think are all romantic songs.
Four different women! I've had sex way more times!
Y'know those big-big uh, road signs that say "Merge?"
Dude, don't rub my face in your crazy single life!
Oh, give her the deposit! Give her the ring! I don't care!
You took off your pants and climbed under the sheets!
Damn! The tailpipe's not hot enough to light this!
No, interestingly enough her leaf blower picked up.
Before or after you were shot by your own troops?
Oh, don't say that! Don't say that. That's not true. Is it?
Op, y'know what though, it's kind've a girlie briefcase.
Doesn't know, "Hello." But she knows Capricorn One.
Would you like me to write her a little poem as well?
Don't look honey. Change the channel! Change the channel!
Ah he's a, he's not a big fan of foosball.
Okay, two, three years of rent, utilities, food...
With the balled-up socks? I figured you taught him that.
Hey, come on, we got the gift, the concert, and the cake.
Well, we used there's up last night making scary faces.
Yes. Yes! Right! And I feel horrible. You have to believe me!
And they don't like it when you explain why your jokes are funny.
Bravo Dennis thanks for pleasing my mother so.
Who are you? Ansel Adams?! Get outta here!
You actually think that something can happen between Emily and Susan?
Make sure you put all that stuff back in the closet, okay?
Did they teach you that in your anger management class?
Oh, I don't know man. I haven't talked to her in like ten years.
There is nothing like the support of your loving wife, huh?
Sure, you guys don't have this problem, you're made of wood. Hey!
"The phone. Bringing you closer to people...who have phones."
Ok, I don't care what you guys say, something's bothering her.
Oh really? Then how come no one here is wearing them?
Ho-ho, so hard we had to throw out your underwear again?
Shhhh! Shhhhh! Shhhhh! Shhhhh! I can't, I can't hear you.
By the way, this didn't seem so dorky in the hall.
Because it's complicated, it's complex- Hey, you kissed my mom!
I don't think of her that way, you know, she's a, she's a colleague.
Yeah. Well, I think our second fight is going to be a big one!
Well, no, actually she uh, asked me if I wanted to get a drink.
Look at Officer Ross riding back here with the visitors.
For the last time no! Get out! Get out, Joey!
Oh, did you get that from the 'I Love Rachel' pizzeria?
Okay. Now all we've got to do is get rid of this chair.
Hey! Babe! Aren't you excited we're going on our honeymoon?
Which is why geese are so relaxed this time of year.
Oh, uh, well, I haven't seem it but if I do I'll let you know.
Hey, Ben, remember us? Ok, the mole came off.
What?! It's not right! We're not ready to have a kid now!!
I also want you to remember that I let you live here rent free!
Please God don't let it be Kung Pow Chicken.
Okay. "So. Whaddya want from me, Damone, huh?"
You're welcome. Hey Joey, thanks for parking the car .
Maybe we shouldn't pay our phone bill-free phone sex.
Well, I'm so confused as to what we've been doing so far...
So he has to be a male who has at least $50.
Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian... Did I say that out loud?
He can do more than that! He can destroy the universe!
I'd love to stay, but I have eh... got a hot date...
So I laugh at my boss's jokes, what's the big deal?
Hey Rach! There she is...My perfectly proportioned wife.
Okay, you know how that people say that Tulsa is the Paris of Oklahoma?
When I walk outside naked people throw garbage at me.
So in your whole life, you've only been with one oh.
Oh really? Uh, Monica said she had a date at 9:00.
Well, instead of just hanging out, we figure we'd do nothing.
Well, can we help?! You want us to take you back to the house?!
Alright look Ross I'll give you 50 dollars for your underpants.
Hey! Wow! You look great! Wanna move in with me tomorrow?
Ah, you're still just a little fat girl inside aren't you?
Yes, the doctors say if they remove it, he'll die.
So, how's the hideously inappropriate crush on Rachel coming?
Okay, if you see a little version of me in there? Kill it!
Ah, no-no-no just Ross. Ross and Joey is embarrassing enough.
Yeah, you don't want to be stuck with us for the next five weeks.
Are you sure Joe? Are you sure you're not just a sex addict?
Yes! Way to go, man! Still got the egg, huh?
You know, it's... something funny about sneakers. I'll be right back.
Yes there are, I just saw them a few minutes ago.
Look, you don't have to draw an actual wo-whoa! She's hot!
Are there no conscious men in the city for you two?
Can somebody else hug him? I have to stay by the window.
Ok. Ok. Having a phone has finally paid off.
No. No, I-I was, I was talking about the book I was reading.
Yeah, I mean, it would be rude to them for us to leave now.
Wow, I don't know what to say. Wow, I, I don't know what to say.
I was not trying them out, Susie asked me to wear them.
Oh, well then, if anybody should have a party it should be him.
Chandler, Chandler Bing. I'm not gay, I'm not gay at all.
That was one of the worse things ever. And not just on TV.
I can see it from right here. It'll cost you one husband.
That's right. You're husband's home. So, now the sex can stop.
Oh, I just went for a walk, around the living room. Whatever...
Why are you napping over here instead of over at your place?
Okay, for the last time. It's not named for each individual man.
Well that's the brilliance of it. The pretty people... and the running.
Ok, so now that you're in, what are you gonna do if we win?
Why don't you use ours across the hall, 'cause she...has...problems.
It must be a virus. I think it erased your hard drive.
Oh, that's fine! Go with your instincts, go with your instincts.
This is great, another Thanksgiving with nothing to give thanks for.
Ok, I'm makin' a break for it, I'm goin' out the window.
Yes, as a matter of fact he did, so I can't let you go.
Then put out fire by peeing, no get invited back.
All right. I've got a plan. I'll go down the fire escape.
Well, you're not suggesting that we spend all of the money on the wedding?
Which is why Asteroids is perfect! It's the oldest game!
Yeah, I wanted to make a dramatic scene, but I hate packing.
No! In his office! How many kisses were there?
Oh yeah, me too. Y'know if this shirt is dirty. Yep.
Wow! Really?! We get all this rusty crap for free?!
Oh no thanks. I don't like any thing from my Scottish heritage.
Because then we would be the guys who turned off free porn.
Y'know, if you're gonna work late, I could look in on him for you.
What does a guy have to do to be taken seriously around here?!
Oh y'know what, I was already trying to trade for ah, well, you.
Yes, but the batteries... Chandler: Thank you, thank you very much!
Well, I can't say "hump" or "screw" in front of the B-A-B-Y.
I was being Shelly Winters from The Poseidon Adventure.
Well, you can see my dad in Vegas kissing other dads.
Wait a minute, hold the phone! You're not Elizabeth's dad?!
Uhh, a T-shirt that says, "I don't belong here."
Oh, Richard. That's all I ever hear, Richard, Richard, Richard!
Hey-hey-hey. So what happened? A forest tick you off?
Wait a minute, all jokes aside? I didn't agree to that!
Sure. And listen, thanks for doing that for us, by the way.
Oh I'm sorry, you're kicking me out of my own living room?
I just want you to know that what you witnessed in there, that wasn't for fun.
Well yeah, in that it's not being used and I... have it to spare.
Oh, I see. I thought you just really, really liked your new couch.
Okay. I've been thinking about it too, and I, I think we're ready.
Maybe it was his sister's. You know, maybe it was his daughter's.
Petrie, right, right. Okay, some people gonna be working this weekend.
Well, I guess there's nothing left for us to do but-but kiss.
Oh yeah, Dana Keystone. She was in my Movement class.
Well, I'm sorry if my friends aren't as sophisticated as yours.
So when you said, "Get up early," did you mean 1986?
So ah, Joey tells me you two met in acting class.
Muskogee! That's like four hours from Tulsa. Woo hoo!
When I was growing up I...played the one on the far left.
Ground control to Major Tom! Commencing countdown...engines...on!
Well, y'know I'm 29. I mean who needs a savings account.
He's right. Nobody's gonna benefit, and you're just gonna hurt her.
I confronted her, and she didn't deny it! I don't live here!
Oh no-no-no, no more offers. You can't offer anything to us!
No. Is there anyway, anyway you think he'll understand this?
But this is eleven. It's almost twice as hard up here.
Y'know I am the groom right? I was told it was kinda big deal.
No, the thing was, we were gonna go see Hootie and the Blowfish.
Okay, but don't touch it, because you fingers have destructive oils.
Stay back, I've got kiwi. Run, Joey, Run!
Actually Pheebs its more of a husband and wife kinda thing.
No! I want a flabby gut and saggy man breasts!
All right, hold on! If you win, we give up the birds.
Yes you can. You're thinking about time, you can't go back in time.
Hey, come on, give me a break, I'm out on a limb here.
Right. So, it'll be the same except... less sex with you.
Oh, yeah, sure, it's not mine anyway. It can with the pants.
Oh yeah, that sounds great. Oh, and listen, it's, it's gonna be....
That's the thing, see I would like to stay in the pribe of mwha-ah-libe.
Gap commercial. So did you book them? Did you call?
Well, you're welcome. And tell them we're really glad they're coming.
Okay I promise. I'll-I'll hate it. Wow! You-you look...hideous.
Okay, no problem, just remember to wake us up before you go-go.
Really? Worse than, "More turkey Mr. Chandler?"
I can't believe her! Did she tell you we were having money problems?
Forgive me? You haven't been taking my calls in a week!
Okay, make sure you look both ways before you cross the street.
Four hours? You guys have been doing this for four hours?
A cool phone number, and a possible name for the kid.
Well I mean, let me get the door first. Oh, hi! No one.
All right, great, road trip baby! This okay with you?
Eldad, sit down. Move over! Move over now!
I know it sounds really weird, but we're just so bad at relationships.
I invented the game of Cups as a way to give Joey money.
In my defense, it was dark and he was a very pretty guy.
Guys thank you very much but neither of you is marrying us.
No, I almost did, couldn't leave Ross there without a spotter!
So great things are happening at work and in your personal life!
That's why our honeymoon photos look like me and Diana Ross!
I'm not sure what they did, but I'm inclined to blame Enron.
Y'know, I would be offended, but Monica is freakishly strong, so...
Oh, you do? Because she said you guys havent talked in like years.
Forty-five minutes? We have tickets to the Musicman at 8:00.
No, no, I'm just looking for a man to draw on me with chalk.
Do you even remember which part of the wall is not spackle?
There's a beautiful woman at eight, nine, ten o'clock!
Honey, you did call him back. 'Cause, it's, it's really old.
If this is the way all the Gellers flirt, we don't have a problem.
DO NOT DISTURB DO NOT DISTURB! Monica:
Whoho ho... Listen to the judgement from the porn star!
Is that why you became a chef? So that people would like you?
Okay. You won't believe what Monica's older brother just said to me!
Great story again! The yarns that you weave! Woo-hoo-hoo!
Should I use my invisibility to fight crime or for evil?
What honey, it's like fifteen blocks to the subway. Let's go.
Well, here we are, just a bunch of thirty year olds.
That is funny, maybe for my birthday she'll murder someone.
No. No, I just think that maybe I-I'd heard it somewhere before.
Well, I don't have to buy that, "I'm with stupid" T-shirt anymore.
Oh, y'know what, I'm gonna be okay, you don't have to throw a party for me.
Here you go Phoebe! Here you go Phobo! Phewbedo! Phaybobo.
Honey, we've been over this. I need to be facing the other way.
Right, because it's fast. Because, it's so fast. It's fast!
Hey, I hear what your saying, okay? And, thanks for the warning.
Jeannie, the head of east coast operations Jeannie?
Yeah I know, but I was really confused and then I talked to these guys.
Yeah, and I-I gave first names to all of the foosball players.
Okay, something to cover the smell ... Oven cleaner! Unscented!
Just for a few seconds, so I can know what it is... Please?
And it's not as if you have a boyfriend's shoulder to cry on.
Oh, she's regional Vice President; She's... just below me.
Oh, good, because as of four o'clock this afternoon, I am not.
No, no, see? See? Hey, it's printing. Hey, it's printing!
God! She is not stealing from us! Okay, will you let this go?
Go change! She doesn't want her parents to know she's drunk.
Okay, we have to talk. I'm just getting out of a very serious relationship...
Hey, do you want this done quick, or do you want this done right?
Would you put that back on?! Monica's gonna be here any minute!
So, ahh, how are ya? How ya...How ya... You okay?
Oh, I wish I'd know you were going to do that, I ordered Chinese.
I'm sorry. That's the one thing I can't do. I promised I'd be with Monica.
For a minute there I thought you were actually tryin' to smell something.
So, has anyone talked to Dr. and Mrs. Geller yet?
What? No, I want to watch this. . Did your cable go out?
All right, but you can't use that again for a whole year. I'm in.
Cheese, it's smelly. You must smell a lot of the time too.
Get in here! Hey, and you can not smoke in here! Merry Christmas.
Joey, I uh! I can't believe this is how I'm spending my anniversary.
No, we'll-we'll bring it back! Just put it under your dress.
Nope! Because I'm not your boyfriend. Hey Pheebs, how did it go?
Okay, so how bummed were you when the second sister died huh?
I'll tell you what, I will go get them developed and you can go home.
Are we greeting each other this way now? 'Cause I like that.
Because that's the only part of you he can see when he's on the table!
Ya know, my cousin went to hell on a football scholarship.
Oh come on man! At least let me finish this last one.
Oh uh, as it turns out, we can't do it. Monica has to work.
That's so weird, I had such a blast with him the other night.
If you get this one, we buy everybody here a steak dinner!
He's being silly, because he knows that we enjoy the silliness!
Okay, worst case scenario. Say you never feel like a father.
I'm just trying to help you out! Okay? I wanna make sure that you're okay.
Are you kidding? Okay, I'll give you a hint; I'll give you a hint.
I climb down the fire escape and you can't put that in the closet?
Alright, the truth is, I soiled myself during some turbulences.
She was working on Valentine's Day so we're celebrating it tonight.
Listen, I have to, uh, um, I have to, I have to confess something.
This is gonna be soo cool, dude, we never party anymore!
No, no no no. You'll be fine. Hillary's bind, right?
I'm tellin' you, she leaned back, I could see her brain.
Oh, and you know whose knowledge of her ex-boyfriend is shocking? Monica!
So uh Monica, do you, do you like the Law & Order?
I know what you're thinking, Dave Thomas, founder of Wendy's.
Yes. When Monica and I were in London, we were both in London.
You can call off the roommate search! Hi! I'll be living here.
And sometimes, I'll want you to steal third, and I'll go like this.
Not like that, I won't! Kip would have liked the birds!
Well I think it's safe to say that our friendship is effectively ruined.
Ok well, thanks, you won't regret it. I'll see you tomorrow .
I can't remember the last time I got a girl to take care of my monkey.
I want to say you but, that seems like such an easy answer.
Ok, pure evil, horny and alone. I've done this.
Well I was... I was exactly expecting company after... 9:15.
Soo, ah, Eric, what kind of photography do ya do?
I majored in lightning rounds. All right, we're gonna destroy you.
Well you should meet my uncle, Bada. I'll let myself out.
My chair. Now, if anybody asks, your name is Rosita!
Oh, is it on the computer, cuz I'd love to give it a read...?
That all the pieces of my life are falling right into place!
Because uh...we-we...we split up. Monica and I split up. Hold me.
No I don't! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
See my friend-my friend, Rachel, she wants to be set up.
And then the peacock bit me. Please kiss me at midnight.
Well, you can't just not see Rachel anymore, she's one of your best friends.
Oh, we had a lot of liquor left over from the Christmas party.
You got it! Here we go! Come on! This is great! Ahhh!
Should we go make a baby right now before you change your mind?
I thought I broke Joey's chair! That's why I replaced it with mine!
Oh, thanks! I'm... actually thinking about becoming a motivational speaker.
No, I don't want to tell anybody else because I don't want Monica to find out.
No! No, she didn't say that. I-I-I think you should talk to Monica now.
Well I didn't think that was serious. Ya know I thought that was just a fight.
All right, let's break this down. What exactly did he say to you?
I'm sorry, I thought you were Joey's other grandmother. I've done it again.
Okay, okay. You have to help us decide whose joke this is.
Well, you couldn't have looked everywhere or else you would've found her!
You'd think that would embarrass me, but you see I'm maxed out.
I couldn't say that I was naked because she's allowed too see me naked.
Well, maybe it's a contest, y'know? Like, collect all five?
Oh, thanks, but I think she'd feel like we're gangin' up on her.
No bunny at all!! Always no bunny at all!!!
Y'know what, I'm, I'm gonna spend some alone time with the pen.
Yeah, about 300 guys I went to high school with. Yeah, thanks.
There's not gonna be a next time! You can not ever see him again!
Hi. Okay, you're too late okay? Because she's already with our guy.
She is gonna recognize that I did a nice thing and-and, appreciate it.
So you...you don't want to live with Don in a cheese house?
If only there was something in your head to control the things you say.
Ho, ho, ho, holy crap is it hot in here!
I am sorry I am late. You'll understand when you'll see Joey.
It can't happen like this. Okay? I'll meet you back at the hotel.
Yes, but you ended up having sex with both of them that afternoon.
Okay, you get her in here. You bolt the door. I'll be in the closet.
Yes, if it really doesn't mean anything, because you know that I'm just not ready...
No, we're just four people with neck problems. You talk like this.
Because she's not eleven! And it's not the seventh night of Hanukkah!
No, I'm afraid I won't be able to make love as well as him.
It's not a big deal. It's, just it's right here, and it's all the time.
Now I know it's been awhile, but I took it as a good sign.
I would but mine doesn't fit. The pants are a little tight.
Ah-ha, you're not the boss of me. Yeah, you are! Ooh, saucy.
It's funny. When you said "unpaid" it sounded like you said "unpaid."
Ok, I think she's trying to tell us something. Quick, get the verbs.
This is the way that I find out. Most moms use the phone.
At least he died doing what he loved... watching blimps.
I thought you said those jokes were funny. Joke! Joke! Joke!
Leave me alone! For the love of God, leave me alone!!!
I also got this great salt and pepper shaker from the restaurant.
So if Monica's not around, then I'm not good enough to raise Emma?
That sounds good. I'll call you- or you call me, whatever...
Hey! Honey, can I ask you a question about the Valentine's Day gifts?
Oh you wouldn't uh, care. It's just a stupid comic book story.
Yeah o-, OK, alright. Doesn't matter, time for Baywatch.
Yeah-yeah, so big that it actually makes our doors look smaller!
Do you think I work at some kind of boot pricing company?
Wha- wh- why, why, why does he suspect that?
Great! Now, we can go to the Ranger game! Last night!
Damn. My mail order grandfather hasn't come yet.
Why? Wh- wh- why is Mr. Douglas looking for me?
Why, it's six tickets to Hootie and the Blowfish! The Blowfish!
Oh, it would be you! You! Monica! And you'd get all the votes!
Ya know there isn't a part of that sentence I don't need explained.
All right. Look, I'm gonna go in here, and you don't buy me anything ever.
Okay! Okay! Okay! You win! You win!! I can't have sex with ya!
I mean, especially considering how tough it's been for you to find work.
Oh, I thought that's what they used to cover Connecticut when it rained.
Right, calm down, O'Mally. I'll slip him some money.
Joey, you have to tell her what's going on! And what did it look like?!
What? No, I'm taking Monica to a romantic inn in Vermont !
And the inventor of the door rests happily in his grave.
Y'know, I don't know why you're so embarrassed, they were very nice boobies.
Oh, yeah, well, poor Richard. Y'... I can grow a moustache!
Luckily, the guy she settled for can't hear what you're talking about.
Stunning entertainment center. Fine, fine Italian craftsmanship.
They look great! Does your boyfriend have the best taste or what?
Don't touch the phone! I'll get it, I'll get it, I'll get it!!
Okay, but you gotta push past this because it is about to get so good!
Honey, I know you're in pain right now, but I'm a little turned on.
Oh, so being a good friend means acting like a total jerk?
No, I prefer to keep a safe distance from all this merriment.
Honey why am I watching a bunch of sharks swimming around.
Oh my God! That is so not the opposite of taking somebody's underwear!!
I didn't mean that. I just meant that the apartment is worth so much more.
Yeah, I can say that I have a conference and you can say you have a chef thing.
A freakish thin date with a hanger for her head?
Well, what did you think, that-that elves came in and fixed it?
Really? So, you're gonna stick with this 'it's all for her' thing?
I dunno what it is, it just doesn't quite feel like Christmas to me.
Kip, my old roommate, y'know we all used to hang out together.
All right, I'm gonna do it! I'm gonna get shot down. Any advice?
Monica, it's 6:30 in the morning. We're not working out, it's over.
Yes, but there's two in martini, soo everybody back to my office.
Oh, come on. I can never get a girl like that with conventional methods.
Well that's good. Because you didn't! And I'm incredibly happy for ya!!
That's funny, this conversation's how I got the bullet hole in my head.
Nothing, just your overcoat sounds remarkably like Brent Mussberger.
Yeah! Sure, sure. So, what was going on with you today? Oh-oh-oh!
Life-sized Imperial Storm Troopers from Sharper Image?
What, no, "Nice apartment, I bet the bedrooms are huge?"
Okay. Okay. All right. Help! Am I a Mark, or a John?
Okay, I guess we can lose to junior high girls some other time.
Nice camoflauge man, for a minute there I almost didn't see ya.
All right, I suppose I can wait a day. Hey, what are you doing Friday?
Well you see in Cups, once you get $700, you have to double it.
Okay, I'll give them back. Look! What is so great about that sandwich?
Because you kept talking to him while he was trying to go to the bathroom?!
See, it pays to know the man who wears my shoes. Me.
I was looking forward to playing basketball, but I guess that's out the window.
No no! I just love the way you look, I am warm, for your form.
Me! I do that. So... Seriously, do I look okay? I'm little nervous.
See ya. Have fun planning your mellow bachelor party.
Yeah, we could do that without y'know risking our lives at all!
That was in the fourth grade. How could you still be upset about that?
Listen ah, Joe, I-I need to, I need to talk to you about something.
So, you heard it, you repeated it, so that must mean you wrote it.
Love her! That's right, I...LOVE...HER!!! I love her!! I love you, Monica.
Well, just until we find an energy source to replace fuel.
I'm trppd... in an ATM vstbl... wth Jll Gdcr!
Come on Monica, it's our Valentine's Day. Please? Please-please, please?
And I will cook anything you want in here , and do anything in there!
Hey, this isn't like swimming after you eat, pick up the phone!!
Any chance you are trying to pick a fight to make all this easier?
Yes!! I love you! I can't even remember what we were fighting about!
Oh, I'm sorry, am I getting in the way of all the room switching fun?
Mmmm. Not tonight, honey. I got an early day tomorrow.
That would be impossible to resist if you weren't all drippy here.
Honey, it's not the bath I enjoy, it's the wet, naked lady.
Does he say that before he sticks his thermometer in your touchy?
Oh, that's uh, that's pretty nice but I'm gonna go with the one I picked first.
Ha-ha-ha. A little to hard. What am I not ah, boyfriend material?
Y'know I rued the day once...didn't get a whole lot else done.
I want to. I love her so much, but I'm afr...It's too huge.
Hey! Look I brought a friend for dinner, this is Zack, from work!
Whoa! And this manchild has no problem with how old you are?
See Joe, that's why your parents told you not to jump on the bed.
Well, it's like that old saying, have some sex, eat some cake.
It's all very, very good. So you wanna go uh, mix it up?
Hey, look at this! They're lighting the big Christmas tree tonight.
Uh, no, I got to see Donald Trump waiting for an elevator.
Ok, but can you tell him that, because he thinks he's too pink.
Because he thinks I slept with his ex-girlfriend and killed his fish.
Danielle! Hi! Uh- everybody, this is Danielle, Danielle, everybody.
Pheebs you didn't have to get us anything for our wedding you already sang...
Yeah, Joey just pressed something on the remote and it just, came on!
Well, you want me to uh, clench anything, or-... Susie? Susie.
Yes! Good thing we have that, 'Not in New York' rule.
Umm, so this Aunt Marilyn is-is-is-is she coming to the wedding?
No, Beth doesn't die, she doesn't die. Does she Rachel?
Ohh that's the worse thing that can happen on an anniversary ever!
This is so bad. If-if you're not Mary-Angela, then-then who is?
All right. I will go out and I will try to find something for her, okay?
Really...? See... that's the thing: you gotta keep it smart, people!
I'm trppd... in an ATM vstbl... wth JLL GDCR.
Hey, look, I know what it is to be a friend, I just-I just screwed up!
Eleven days before Halloween.. all the good costumes are gone?
Monica has a secret closet and she won't let me see what's in it.
God, it's great to catch up! I can't believe how long it's been!
Damn those robots, they're supposed to be our faithful servants!
I did break up with her! She just took it really, really well!
Hi! Hi! You're crazy! Okay? This is Emily. Emily is straight.
Ya know if you want to, I can just hold them down and you could .
Well, I have kissed over four women. Do you wanna get under the covers?
And those guys were this close to lettin' us play this time too.
Because if I go home, we're gonna become the Bings! I can't be the Bings!
Okay, look I need your help, I don't know what to get her for Valentine's Day.
Well, I'll tell ya I do enjoy guilt, but, ah, it wasn't me.
Clearly I did not start drinking enough at the start of the meal.
Braid each other's hair and ride horseback on the beach?
Well next time ask! Or at least wait for me to ask!
I'm just saying that sometimes we like to do stuff that costs a little more.
That's why for an entire year people called me Sir Limps-A-Lot?!
Pheebs, if she could come back as a couch, we'd really appreciate it.
Joey, be a pal. Lift up my hand and smack her with it.
Wow, that's lucky. What if her name was Big Ugly Splotch?
Ok, who wants light cheese, and who wants dark cheese?
Are you kidding? If I wasn't married she'd be rejecting me right now.
Listen, Phoebs, this is gonna be OK. Ross, Russ. Russ, Ross.
Ooh! Yes! Okay! Here's what we do, we-we forget it happened.
Buy stamps, pick up dry cleaning...Don't let Phoebe in.
What would you give to a kid if he wanted a ticket to play with?
Honey, we're leaving tomorrow you've still got a lot of packing to do.
Okay, y'know, we-we're safe right? I mean nothing bad can go down!
Uh, Joey's having an embolism, but I'd go for a Nip, y'know?
Richard! No one supposed to know about us! See I, did it again.
That's a good idea. I wonder where I could get a basket of porn...
So, ahh, what kind of powers would Gold Man have?
Someone on the subway licked my neck! Licked my neck!!
Y'know what? It seems like all of the sudden; so much has happened.
See, that's why I could never be an actor. Because I can't say gig.
Well good, good for you. You really think that Roger is the perfect guy?
So, Joey on Law & Order, you must be very proud!
Joey kicked me out of the car on the George Washington bridge!
Yes, I believe we can expect a call from the President any moment now.
Yeah, I'm gonna pass. 'Cause I was kinda iffy when it was puppies.
Yes! I love you! I've never loved anybody as much as I love you.
Can I come a little bit closer, valuable things are getting squished...
'kay, look: Can we just drop this? I'm not gonna smoke again.
I do! Want a hint? huh? "I do" "I do".
Yeah. I feel so bad. Is there anything I can do to make it up to you?
Oh, good, good. Play more, 'cause I wanna see how it ends.
Great, a faster way to tell people that I'm unemployed and childless .
Interesting, cause in my dreams, I'm allways surprisingly inadequate.
Can't believe you guys bought that, enjoy your slow death .
Ok, so it's just because it was my table, I have to buy a new one?
I think this is probably why Damone smokes in his cell alone.
Pulling flowers out it makes the bag look a lot more masculine.
All right, so you're telling me that I have to tell racist jokes now?!
Apparently my sperm have low motility and you have an inhospitable environment.
That is so not... That is so not... That... Oh, shut up!
Okay Bob listen uhh, I'm the reason you didn't get the job up here.
Okay, but be careful okay, because I wanna get our security deposit back.
Look, I'm sorry! But there's nothing I can do, I think I'm in love with her!
That's right! It was the wrong kind of eight, no wedding! Damnit!
Yes. Yes, there is, they play on Sundays and Monday nights.
Yeah, now how's that going though? Are you okay with the not-flirting thing?
Well, we're really not that close. Okay, so I guess this is uh, good-bye then.
Oh, that's The Wedding March. Does, does that freak you out?
Carol? I was just wondering if Joey could ask you a question about breast-feeding?
Yeah. I know it must be important to you when you start chattering like a monkey.
Nope! Every once and a while I just scream stuff at the TV.
The big deal is I was sitting there last, so, that's my seat.
Nothing! It's over! Dammit! This is regularly scheduled programming!
Okay, but there is a big difference. You are a lot hotter than I am.
Yeah, and someday when you're ready, you'll make it past the hedges.
That's funny. Does it-does it hurt? Does the labor hurt?
Lowell? Financial Services' Lowell, that's who you saw me with?
Nothing happened? Nothing? So you didn't tell my girlfriend that you love her?
Yeah but when he proposed to me with the ring I got goose bumps.
Please, don't take away my cool thing. Please?! Pretty please?!
So, what are you doing here? I thought tonight was your big anniversary dinner.
Oh good, because uh we got Rachel 800 gallons of water.
Oh! Right. Umm, maybe that's because I didn't send him an invitation.
His legs flail about as if independent of his body!
Okay, easy Martina. I think we should let them win the next game.
I was surprised to see a kangaroo in a World War I epic.
Yes it was very sad when the guy stopped drawing the deer!
Oh, okay, I have condom in my wallet that I've had since I was twelve.
I believe in tall, handsome strangers who hit on my wife!
Oh what is it honey, you need some tea? Some soup? Oh-ohhhh!
Oh! That's great, they haven't seen the place since I moved in!
They were just giving those away at the store in exchange for money.
I don't know. I can't tell, what ever it was went back in too quickly.
Uhh, yeah. She uh, she uh, she uh might've mentioned him.
Yes, but in Ross's case, they both know in two weeks that's it.
Y'know I'm-I'm really glad we decided not to sleep together before the wedding.
Yeah, we played, we watched TV.. that juggling thing is amazing.
yeah just some good old fashion girl on girl American action.
Absolutely! Y'know, because touchie can mean both ass and good worker.
Yeah. Just let me grab my jacket and tell you I had sex today.
Well, Joey, I wrote a little song today. It's called Get Up.
Oh yeah? Listen, don't tell Monica, she'll rip your heart right out.
Hey, no way! Come on, this is you guys, call her and work it out.
Hey Rach! Ah........ Perfection. Wouldn't change a thing. Not a thing.
Nothing, just a little extra air in my mouth. Pffft. Pffffffft.
Oh my God! If you say that one more time, I'm gonna break up with you!
Oh no-no-no, no. No, no, no, I just, I just need a pretend ticket.
Why don't you go up on stage. I'll get a picture of you doing the speech.
Hey Joey, do you wanna play football or you wanna.. Hi, I'm Chandler.
It's-it's about Kathy. Umm, uh, I like her. I like her a lot actually.
Well, this was great. I'll give you a call. We should do it again sometime.
Oh that makes me feel so warm in my hollow tin chest.
Thanks for trying. Oh, and by the way there is no Count Rushmore!
I'm up! I'm up, I've gotten up now! Anybody ah, want anything?
Okay this is great, but Joey said he didn't want any of us out there.
Hey now besides, if worst comes to worst, I'll be your boyfriend.
Who walks into a room and asks to see a person's hands?!
Emma? Emma? Look at me! Well, I think I'll go downstairs for a while.
Yeah! I'm just pretending to watch the game so I don't have to help out with stuff.
Y'know, if you listen closely, you can hear a thousand retailers scream.
Would you get that please? People have been calling to congratulate me all day.
Yeah, we were just talking about that. I can't believe how stupid we used to look.
Hey Jo. When'd you start usin' mousse in your hair?
How many times have I told you guys, you never watch the cooking channel!
Yeah, well, I only have twenty minutes until Ethan, so, y'know..
Well see now that I can see crying over, but Bambi is a cartoon!
I'm full, and yet I know if I stop eating this, I'll regret it.
Ah, well, maybe thats, ah, because youre getting a big raise.
Ah, I fooled around with Joey's sister. Well, that's not the worst part.
What happened to 'you can't live without me four days a week'?
I cannot believe Ross told you that! And in my defense, it was a Wendy's!
All right. "My husband is sleeping with his secretary." She's married!
You got the lead in a movie? That's amazing! What's the movie about?!
Yep. That's a lot of cats Jo Lynn. Single are ya?
Oh since forever! I used to go all over town listening to bands!
Look, I'm just gonna be across the hall, we can still do all the same stuff.
If we keep talking this way, aren't we gonna freak her out soon?
You just, you look so different! Terrific! That dress! That body!
I'm sorry man, there's never a good time to stop catching on fire.
Let me ask you, do you have to be Carol's lesbian life partner?
Because sometimes, Phoebe after you sleep with someone, you have to kill the fish.
No you are not! You are sweet and wonderful and this is gonna happen for you.
Well, I just thought it'd make me feel good to do something nice for my friend.
She's not gonna care if I put her stuff back in the same stupid place.
Hey, does anybody need anything copied? I'm going down to the Xerox place.
Look, I may not know a lot about babies, but do you really think I'm not capable?
What rule? There's no rule, if anything, you owe me a table!
But I didn't get to shake my belly like a bowl full of jelly.
Wait a minute, hold the phone! You're not talking about Chuckles University?!
If that is your father calling to tell this story then the marriage is off!
Well, don't we look nice all dressed up?...It's stuff like that, isn't it?
You know, once youre inside, you dont have to knock any more.
Oh, and Ive got Earth Science, but I'll catch you in Gym.
Thanks, Phoebe. But I just don't really see myself in a big white hat.
Yes, and while I'm doing that, Ross has a great computer story for you.
Yeah, the last six weeks. I wanted this to be a moment you will never forget.
Look, we're not just messing around! I love her. Okay, I'm in love with her.
It's, all good! Okay bye-bye Mon! She's-she's gonna kill me.
Okay, I thought of the joke two months ago at lunch with Steve.
How did you guys find me? I knew I should've hid at the gym!
You wouldn't know if Jeanette's planning on keeping her baby, would ya?
All right, if I do this, can we at least discuss sex on the balcony?
Oh, you know, I would, but that might get in the way of my lying around time.
Yeah, huh. I'm just uh, you know I'm just picking up some things for a party.
AND TO ALL A GOOD NIGHT! *Opening Credits*
Sounds like two people are really enjoying the Dewey decimal system.
Typical Christmas-y stuff, you know? Our holidays are pretty traditional...
Dog grooming huh? Okay, just don't make my tail too poofy.
Alright, alright, but you better be wearing clothes when I open my eyes.
Really? Wow. That's some pretty powerful imaginary sperm you must have there.
Well, then it looks like somebody is gonna have to give back somebody his cushions.
But you said you forgave me. It was just a couple of cigarettes-no big deal.
Well, the gay community is a lot more vocal than the dead community.
I don't know, but Donald Trump wants his blue blazer black.
Okay, so Rachel's got 48 and Phoebe has the lead in...vegetables, Joey?
Wow, it seems serious. What seems to be the problem, Ashley Judd?
Oh please, I saw the way you were checking out his mouldings. You want it.
Janice was my safety net, ok? And now I have to get a snake.
Well, I... I've got a pop-up book that told me everything I need to know.
Cheese you say? That's some pretty smelly work, huh Don?
Okay. And it's not just chicks y'know? It's all kinds of other animals!
Hey look, are we gonna have to bring this out every time Ross comes over?
I don't know! What could she possibly be hiding in here that I can't see?!
So, how would you like to have a baby that's half yours and half his!
So apparently we just don't pay for food anymore. Do you see what I see?
Wow, what a geek. They spent $69.95 on a Wonder Mop.
Yeah, I thought so to until I paper mached one of my eyes shut.
Oh. Well, hold on camper, are you sure you've thought this thing through?
Look, I can't do this. I can't make luv to you while we're fighting this way.
No, look, that's it, it's over, I want you out, I want you out of the apartment now.
I don't, I hate Joseph, ok. I think he's a brown-nosing suck up.
But I didn't get to shape my belly like a bowl full of jelly.
Well why didn't you stop her?! Why didn't you just tell her it was a plan?!
Your little men are gonna get scored on more times than your sister.
Oh my God, I can't believe this! Y'know, I thought...I thought you were a good guy.
Look Joe, I just, I just don't want to get your hopes up real high.
Oh, believe me, to survive this party, you're gonna have to come up with one too.
Y'know, it's been a while since we've screamed something. Maybe we should.
Look, you know what? If this is the way you feel, then maybe you should take it.
Ohh, great, I have condom in my wallet I've had since I was twelve.
Sur-surprise him? We're not, we're not gonna make anybody mad are we?
The only superpower you have is a slightly heightened sense of smell.
The fact that you'd even ask that question shows how little you know me.
They were huge. When she sneezed, bats flew out of them.
I figured I'd buy those. Pat, I'd like to buy a vow.
He's not supposed to ask my girlfriend to marry him! I'm supposed to do that!
Ok, now, remember, no trading. You get the pretty one, I get the mess.
No, I guess I just never really cried. Y'know? I'm not a crying kind of guy.
Oh please, could she be more out of my league? Ross, back me up here.
Was it formerly owned by a blonde woman and some bears?
Hey! How come I'm stuck dicing, when he gets to ball the melon.
Well, listen, don't tell us what's gonna happen though, 'cause I like to be surprised.
Okay. Listen-listen, we're not gonna have to walk this way the entire time are we?
Oh yeah, and what would my opening line be? 'Excuse me. Blarrglarrghh.'
Ohh, she's pretty. Pretty ahh, pretty girl, the pretty--she's pretty.
If you need money, will you please-please just let me loan you some money?
Oh yes! Monica, get in here! There's a high-speed car chase on!
Yes, Joey's made arrangements to have his baby in a movie from the 50's.
Yeah, he's lived here for years, I don't, I don't know what you're talking about man.
The spoon. You licked and-and you put. You licked and you put.
Is that your tiny little box, that's too small to put anything in?
I'm going crazy! Okay? Do you have any thing around here that looks homemade?
This reminds me of a very specific part of the tape. Okay, here we go.
Almost as good as that play with the two naked girls on the see-saw.
Oh it's always nicer to here than, "Aw crap! You again!"
I hear ya. But! Unfortunately, my company is transferring me overseas!
All right!! Wait! Wait, there's no sidewalk! Yeah, I'm gonna die here.
Yeah, well, I miss the tip! It's the best part. It has the nail.
Y'know sometimes the good ideas are just right in front of you, aren't they?
Okay, a little problem. The key broke in the lock and I can't get in!
Yeah, Joey said I uh, I needed to relax so he gave me an antihistamine.
It's OK. It's OK. I was always rooting for you two kids to get together.
Hey, we haven't been on a second date, she needs to hear me pee?
No. But uh, Joey has, and I usually talk to them in the morning time.
Another cheesecake came! They delivered it to the wrong address again!
Uhh, that was Joey. He's running a little late, he says he's sorry.
Y'know what Rach, maybe you should just, y'know stay here at the coffee house.
That's a good thing actually, because ah, he used to have me rehearse with him.
Stop it! You're killing me! I think I just moved on to Phase Four!
It's a hand. It's a thing you use as a Jack and Coke holder.
I don't believe it. The most romantic night of my life and I'm runner up.
Look forget it okay? I don't want to go. I don't want to see him. I don't wanna.
No it's not. It's small. It's tiny. It's petite. It's wee.
Oh, ain't this nice? It's so quiet, I could just lie here all day.
What are you talking about? We love Schhteve! Schhteve was schhexy!.. Sorry.
Oh hey, it's, it's terriffic. I mean it's a regular space... fest.
OK, I'm gonna get some more coffee before the pinching and eye-poking begins.
Does that room have a closet I can lock him in? We'll take it.
Technically we could have sex again. What do you think, bossy and domineering?!
I don't get it, I mean, you just got him. How can he be an adult already?
Maybe I could give thanks by taking my Playstation over to my new apartment.
So you can balloon up or you can shrink down and I will still love you.
Oh, she's at home, putting up decorations for Rachel's birthday party tonight.
Eh, they're both good. I generally just go with, Monica's drunk again.
Yeah, if that was true, gym class would've been a lot more interesting.
Whoah whoah, back up there, Sparky. What'd you mean by that?
Kinda puts that whole pillow thing in perspective, huh, Mon?
I just walked in the bathroom and saw Kathy naked! It was like torture!
Half a tank? We still got a lot of high-speed chasing to do!
Hey it's the most eligible man in NY. How's the moving on going?
I just came over to drop off...nothing. So that weekend kinda sucked, huh?
Oh yeah, well can you picture me saying "Go to your room! You're grounded"?
What...? That's not you! Life is good again! Ride 'em cowgirl!
Monica! Can I talk to you for a second? Listen, I appreciate you getting me the costume...
It's your parents' anniversary and you're going to talk about their dead pet?
You know, this is actually good, because if we ever lose Ross, we have a spare.
So Dan, nurse not a doctor huh? Kinda girlie isn't it?
Yeah, that'd be much worse than being 28, and still working here.
No, I realize that honey, but I'm not gonna spend all of the money on one party.
Oh? Did somebody miss me? Is there a child to raise poorly?
OK well here, we'll just move the coffee table closer to the couch.
Is it just me, or can you actually see his abs through his overcoat?!
She's not gonna make you wear one of those big plastic cones, is she?
Well, I don't see that we have a choice. But, when we're back home, we don't do it.
Of course the packaging does appeal to grown-ups and kids alike.
Oh yeah. First off all, chasing the Churo guy isn't jogging.
Yeah, she, she brought the invisible cab. . . hop in.
Oh good. Good, because I'm sure this interview is gonna last a couple of weeks.
I-I can't believe Jill's gone. I can't help it, I opened a gate.
Nah, not so much. Alright, now we smoke. Oh.. my.. God.
Well, I'm here to see my old buddy Ben. What are you doing here, weird...turtle-man?
Uh, what about y'know the massage thing? That never gave you a heart attack.
Okay, all right, I'll just uh, make sure that uh, Joey gets her something really great.
So I was right. This is what it feels like to be right. It's oddly unsettling.
The most unbelievable thing has happened. Underdog has just gotten away.
Okay, ten bucks says that we can name every item in that bag.
We wanted to kiss at midnight, but nobody else is going to so y'know...
Oooh, did he put a little starch in your bloomers? Who said that?
Well this is great! I'll give you a call! We should do it again sometime!
Oh, Ross, when you make out card; be sure to make it out to, EM-I-LY.
Then, I might as well ... do this . Not really sure what to do now.
No, I mean it, this feels really good. Is it a hundred percent cotton?
It's fine, it's fine. Look, do you wanna get this part, or not? Here.
Well, maybe since the age of 9, Frannie's made some new friends.
Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew!
I'm sorry. When you were in high school you made out with a 50-year-old woman?
It was at the front door. When I got home. Somebody sent it to us.
Well, let's just say the impressions you made in the butter left little to the imagination.
It's not something to be proud of, okay? You have to go to a sleep clinic!
All right look, I'm changing it to 50 bucks, or your best offer.
I am so much older than these other interns. I can't compete with them.
Oh no-no-no! Stay! Stay! Because you-you should you-you-you should stay!
That thing, it's a uhh. . . yeah it's, it's a little flashy.
Oh, good! Good! Do you guys know how to get a chick out of a VCR?!
Question. If I don't care about my watch, can I use it as a weapon?
Hey Ross, I was wondering if... Oh my God!! Where are all the men???
Our eyes are closed and we're about to cross the street. Very good.
Now, Monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne...
Oh, man. In my next life, I'm coming back as a toilet brush.
Oh well, this was a really important experience for me, and I wanted to share it with you.
Really? What do you do? You just sit in there stewing in your own filth.
Get out. Get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out.
Why not?! I mean it's just, it's just climbing! It's just, it's just steep!
Well, uh, why don't you ask him yourself. Joey, this is my new roommate Eddie.
Well you wouldn't, but we own the paper, we can print whatever we want.
You can't tell, but I'm trying to break the tension by mooning you guys!
Yeah, and not that you would, but I wouldn't hang out with...all the guys in my office.
No ah, hold on a second Joe, where do Dutch people come from?
All right! Go left! Go left! Go right!! Go right!!
Monica says that her Maitre D. is the funniest guy she's ever met.
Weekly Estimated Net Usage Systems. A processing term.
When you go lunching with hunky moustache men and don't tell me about it!
Hey, you guys! Hey, Ross, quick question for ya. Are you ready to party?
If I'd known you guys were coming over, I would have brought more pizza.
Seriously? Seriously, no! You can play your own age which is 31!
Okay, now when you come back I hope you remember that, that chick is not a toy!
Oh my God, it's that Victoria's Secret model. Something... something Goodacre.
Um, we're kind of having an emergency and we-we were looking for something...
Oh-oh, I'm a duck! I go, "Quack, quack!" I'm happy all the time!
You don't want to be guys, you'd be all hairy and wouldn't live as long.
Well, thanks. I grow it myself. Y'know who also has great hair is Joey!
Oh, I'm packing. Y'know I'm-I'm packing 'cause I'm moving to Yemen tomorrow.
That's right! Where are the guys? I'm ready to get drunk and see some strippers.
I'll make something up! I'm good at lying, I actually did borrow your Walkman!
You can't wear that! I'm wearing the famous tux! James Bond's tux!
Look, I understand, but I have to put my foot down. Okay? The answer is no.
Ok, we all laughed when you did it with the stuffing, but that's not funny anymore.
I don't even know the man. Okay? We're not the close. I haven't seen him in years.
Hey, that's not good. Can I get an espresso and a latte over here, please?
We will take a moonlit walk on the Rue de la .
Monica, could you excuse us for a second? I need to talk to the girl with the flowers.
The door hasn't been locked in five years, but okay! Ready?!
I think it's great. It's great. Y'know, they're thinking of changing the name of this place.
Ok, Janice. Janice. You gotta give me Janice. That wasn't about being picky.
All right look, forget it, forget it. You told her you love her, it's over.
Well that's not an, even a real fish. No, that's a goldfish cracker.
The guy was hammered, okay? There's no way, you look like Ross's mother.
Hey, yeah... we could all sleep together and then one of us could get amnesia.
They're not even paying ya! This doesn't even sound like a real movie!
Phoebs, let me ask you something, were, were these, uh, funny brownies?
All right, fine! Fine! Why don't you pull over? I'll get out right now!
No you don't! No, no, no, I say you have to give your divorce another chance.
Yeah, but what if it's not? What if there is a reason why we can't have a baby?
Well then there was the second set, the infamous booger head shots.
Thank you Gunther, put it there. Definitely not easier with coins. Thank you.
Oh, well, ah... maybe thats because theyre ah... jealous, of us.
Oh, they said uh, "You don't have insurance here, so stop calling us."
Okay! Now I assume the Saucer card came up when you played last.
Nothing, except tell you, uh, I think it's wonderful how much energy you have.
You're not gonna die an old maid, maybe an old spinster cook.
Nah-uh! I know you! Okay? I know the thoughts that you have in the head--in your head!
Okay, a quick one. Come on hug it out. Oh hey! There you go. Okay.
Okay. Thats better. Now I want you to both apologize to each other and mean it.
Look I know it was a stupid reason to break up with somebody, but I was 15!
Hey, y'know what? Why don't we think about changes we can make in the living room?
Oh come on, it was so obvious! There was no chemistry between you two!
Oh, that's Parent's Day, first grade. That's me with the janitor Martin.
Listen er..I need to ask you a favor but you can't tell Monica anything about it.
Oh, so that's this is gonna work now? You're just gonna order me around all the time?
Yes, yes, it's just that we ah, we kinda all ready, made plans with Ross.
What?! I am an excellent secret keeper. I have kept all of our secrets.
Mine is the red one! Oh God. Can open, worms everywhere.
Is that Joey? Is that Joey? Let me talk to him! I wanna talk to him!
Look, I appreciate it, but uh, it's a little creepy. Y'know? I'm not a bachelor anymore.
Are you judging them by their covers? Because you're really not supposed to do that.
Ok. So if we both had Emma and I die she'd have to give her up.
If I was a superhero who could fly and be invisible, that would be the best.
If I took this promotion, it'd be like admitting that this is what I actually do.
All right, y'know what, we've been talking about London too much haven't we?
Yeah, I mean we're gonna have to move around some furniture to make room for my chair.
Janice. Hi, Janice. Ok, here we go. I don't think we should go out anymore. Janice.
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
All right, all right, we were. We were trying to make a baby. Monica's ovulating.
Oh, umm, Joey was born, and then 28 years later, I was robbed!!
Hey listen, we've gotta go, I promised Richard we'd meet him downstairs.
The front page? You really do live in your own little world, don't ya?
No. And if I did, I don't think we'd be going out. Monica, this is getting ridiculous!
Okay, okay, just because he buys you dinner, does not mean you owe him anything.
It's very, very nice. Well, come here. I'm very were gonna be having all the sex.
That sounds like my first bike. My dad gave me his old one.
You do owe me so much. You owe me three thousand, four hundred...
Oh my God! Those are my bedroom eyes?! Why did you ever sleep with me?
Yeah. Hey, here's an idea, why don't we use our wedding china today?
Hello. Hi, Janice! Can you hold on for a second? Okay. Okay, what do I do?
It's great. Maybe tomorrow we can rent a car and run over some puppies.
Yeah, I guess I could use that. I could say that your love sends me to the moon.
Uh-huh, first you tell us where you got the prettiest lace in all the land.
Well you know that thing you said before, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't intrigued.
Well, actually, yesterday I was smoking again. Today, I'm, I'm smoking still.
I'm just hanging out. Y'know, having fun. Y'know with the girl that I'm seeing casually.
The bath salts! They're starting to effervesce! It's different. It's interesting.
Hey, I can be pretty charming, babe, I won YOU over, didn't I?
Don't try to sway her. I'm your only chance to have a baby. Okay, let's go.
Where is she, Where is she? Oh, hey, I have a question, where is she?
I'm sorry, we're just kinda excited because we finally have a couple to hang out with.
I'll take one. Sometimes I like to hold stuff like this and pretend I'm a giant.
Oh, And We Should Warn You, Before You Watch It don't watch it.
No, you didn't get me!! It's an electric drill, you get me, you kill me!!
I'm gonna do it tomorrow y'know, and-and surprise her, but now you've ruined it!
Well, my Grandfather was Swedish and my Grandmother was actually a tiny little bunny.
Well they were chair-shaped cows. They never would have survived in the wild.
Okay, let's play! The big game, Italy vs. China, apparently.
Well he's probably mad after you called him this morning to borrow his goggles.
Well, it's a pretty big commitment, I mean, what if one of us wants to move out?
Pheebs, I don't understand. How can you have a roommate that none of us know anything about?
Don't take this personally okay? It's just that I just can't have sex with a sick person.
It's just you and Rachel, just the two of you? This is a date. You're going on a date.
Hey, come on, you came through, you did what you had to do. That is very dad.
Well the people in my group wanna spend the holiday weekend with their families.
Hi! I'm back. Yeah, that sounds great. Okay. Well, we'll do it then. Okay, bye-bye.
He- he- he got in, he- he got in to San Diego.
Is this still about her whole 'The Flintstones could've really happened' thing?
You believe that this guy is destined for someone else and you're still gonna date him?
I mean, don't you think if things were gonna happen with Rachel, they would've happened already?
A tall guy with hair similar to mine, oh unknowable universe!
Well, 'cause she came back the third summer and she'd gotten really fa-aa-aw-ow...
You're gonna be carrying their baby and give them a Sony Play Station?
I am your friend, and I am not gonna let you do this!! You are surprisingly strong!
Yeah, it's two guys in a ring, and the rules are "There are no rules."
So, uhh, em, you want me to uh, give you a hand with the foosball table?
It's very, very nice. Well, come here. I'm very happy were gonna have all the sex.
Because I went to an all boys high school and God is making up for it.
No, it's not that, I just don't want to be stuck here all night with your fat sister.
We didn't get to the audition. I'm gonna take her to coffee and then we'll do it then.
Oh, right, well yeah, I graduated fourth grade and realized I wasn't a pimp.
I'm not even getting married! Okay, this is a question for science fiction writers!
everything's great, just watching some regular television there, what a pleasant surprise.
I think this is the first time in our marriage that I've felt like the more attractive one.
Hey, will you grab me a cruller? Sit down! Will you go to the hospital?!
Look you have to help me out here. I thought we had a deal. I thought by the time...
Na, forget it, it's probably stripped and sold for parts by now.
Would you just please....give me the receipt 'cause this is great. It's top notch.
Well, actually it's a hockey team, so it's angry Canadians with no teeth.
All right, all right, I'll go sleep with my girlfriend. But I'm just doing it for you guys.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, you're right. Come on, do it, do it, go, come on!!!
Maybe, isn't she the woman who lives below you and has sex really loud?
Okay before we start the celebration, Monica has to go put on her party dress.
Okay. But if you don't come back soon, there's pretty much nothing I can do about it!
Is it loaded? Oh, little candy hearts. Chan and Jan Forever.
Eldad is much more cooperative! And he can dance! You dance for Rachel!
Tonight?! Isn't an engagement ring supposed to have a diamond? Oh, there it is!
Well, it's not like I went to Spain. I went to the bathroom, you knew I was coming back.
Y'know what? It's gonna be okay. Y'know what? She's probably not gonna even want to come.
What?! I didn't even know that-Why didn't you tell me?! Why am I talking like this?!
Airplane! Airport! Airport '75! Airport '77! Airport '79!
Well, if it helps there were only three. So it would just be for tonight, right?
You know, I mean, you can't tell your parents you were fired because they'd be disappointed.
I don't think this town is big enough for both of us to relax in. Draw!!
Yeah, can I get a 3-piece, some cole slaw, some beans, and a Coke-(Yelps in
Oh, come on tell me. I could use another reason why women won't look at me.
No, there are great pictures of you standing next to a guy who's going like this...
Okay, there are no famous Joey's. Except for, huh, Joey Buttafucco.
This is Chandler Bing! This is Chandler Bing! Yes, the groom-No! Not the groom!!
You're right, I'm sorry. "Once I was a wooden boy, a little wooden boy..."
Uh, if I were omnipotent for a day, I'd.. make myself omnipotent forever.
Wow, you'd think we should get that over 20 years or go for the big payout.
Yeah but they're right. I mean, I'm not a strong father figure and I never will be.
Yeah, yeah. Some people said some nice things about him. I think somebody should have it.
Y'know, it wasn't that big a deal. He just balled up socks... and a melon...
Now wait a minute, I claimed you in the name of France four years ago.
That's okay Pheebs, we're not having a party or anything, so you don't have to get us...
Yes. Yes, thanks for letting me use your phone... and for saving my life.
Oh, she's got you running errands, y'know, picking up wedding dresses... Wah-pah!
Ross, I am not gonna run away again! I just want to get a little fresh air.
Well, I thought if I littered, that crying Indian might come by and save us.
Oh, I hate that. I once had a thing of half and half, stole my car.
Okay, now will you guys get out of here? I want this is to be a surprise and she's gonna know.
Well, if the magician can open my beer with his but cheeks, then all right.
It's gonna be okay, right? I mean she's not gonna leave me? This is, this is fixable.
Yes, well, I expect this from her. Okay? She's always been a Freudian nightmare.
Well, I'm gonna go home and bask in the triumph of my Central Park idea.
Where did you, when did you, how did you... How did you get a girl like that?
Y'know, I would've bet good money that he'd be the first one of us to get married.
Okay! Listen, I'm gonna be moving out so you will be in charge of paying the rent.
Okay but what about y'know my pinchable butt and my bulging biceps-She knows!
So, you uh, you think that Speed Racer guy gets a lot of tickets er?
Yes! Remember? Right before we cut the cake, I went up to you and I said...
Sleeping with somebody new, anxiety, panic, and I'm afraid even more sweating.
C'mon, there's nothin' to see, it's just a tiny bump, it's totally useless.
Wh-wh-why, wh-why, why, why was there kissing!? There should be no kissing!!
All my energy is going into not asking that question. I can't believe I screwed this up!
Look, I just wanted to apologize for last night. I got the feeling we made you a little uncomfortable.
Do you mind if we stick you in another cabinet? They seem all right with it!
My favorite part was when Superman flew all the Jews out of Egypt.
Y'know, how did I get this reputation as a dropper? Okay? I'm anything but a dropper.
Well, we haven't exactly met, we just stayed up all night talking on the internet.
Yes, and his father invented that magnetic strip on the back of credit cards.
What would she get for herself for two thousand dollars that she wouldn't tell me about?
Y'know what? There's some nice guys at my office, do you want me to set you up?
Joey just called. He's got courtside Knicks tickets for him and me tomorrow night.
We've been driving for a half-hour, and you haven't looked at the road once.
Maybe it's the sound of Ross climbing into my brain and stealing my thoughts.
Pheebs, what are you doing with the coat? How about the whole animal rights thing?
Alright, somebody kiss me. Somebody kiss me, it's midnight! Somebody kiss me!
I'll hold you close in my arms. I can't resist your charms. And love....
Okay, well it this bed isn't new, how come there is plastic on the mattress?
Kind of? If you just kept this to yourself none of this would've happened.
Get the woman a pad! Get the woman a pad! A pad! A pad!
Okay, I have news. You don't have to move to Tulsa. You can stay here and keep your job.
Monica, there are no words... There are no words! This should not be this hard!
Ok Tommy, that's enough mourning for you! Here we go, bye bye!!
No, I don't even think he knew. Hey, would you sleep with somebody to get a great job?
Oh, I'm Ross. I'm Ross. I'm too good for the Hut; I'm too good for the Hut.
Listen, in the middle of everything if I scream the word, "Yippee!" just ignore me.
Oh yeah, that's very nice. Plus, y'know they were free and they're too small.
Okay, but impersonating a police officer is a serious thing. You could get arrested.
Jeez, at 2:30 in the morning, I didn't expect to have to fight over the remote.
You know, I once dated a Miss Crankypants. Lovely girl, kinda moody.
Well I was! Then I went down to the gift shop because I was out of cigarettes...
Okay, here's the thing. We're gonna get you some coffee and they will never know that you're drunk.
I mean, if it were me, I think I'd have difficulty just getting out of bed at all.
Ok, so let me just get this straight. So we're uh, strictly talking about the middle?
Ahh, come on! Y'know what-y'know what, I think I'm just gonna go home and call Kathy.
See, you think it's just a pen, but then you turn it over and it's also a clock.
All right, now look at her and tell me she doesnt look exactly like her sister.
If you listen very carefully, I think its Celebration by Cool and the Gang.
Oh no, it's gonna be named after some snack or baked good isn't it?
A hot girl's at stake and all of the sudden he's Rain Man.
And I was a perfect gentleman and I walked her to her hotel room and said goodnight.
Are you okay? I'm so sorry, he wouldn't leave. He kept asking me about chicken.
Well, I suppose I'd have to say you!! But, what if we're watching a movie in here?
Okay, but let's do it now though, because Chopper 5 just lost it's feed!
Yeah. Either that, or you just turned him on and sent him off to a stripper.
You know when "That's fine" sounds true when someone yells it and spits!
I know, that, that's why I don't want to go tonight, I'm afraid I'm going to say something stupid.
Not to shabby, I got this all off myself...using my wife's tools. Oh my God!
Well, it's a training program, but at the end, they hire the people they like.
No, I hope not! I tried to offer him some money, but he wouldn't take it.
Yeah y-you, how hard is it to say something? Rachel came over to borrow something.
OK, I guess this is gonna seem kinda bittersweet now, but... Joey, that's who.
Yeah, listen. Okay, before you do anything Joey-like, you might wanna run it by err...
Because, you know, you don't have to. If you want, you could just take a nap right here.
Yes, I know, as it happens my room is very very close to the parade route.
Okay and he hasn't proposed yet because she has no ring on her finger.
I'll teach ya! Come on, come on, it's really easy and really, really fun.
Well, that's the best kiss I've had with anyone I've ever met in a men's room.
OK that's not what he was doing. Alright, he was looking for his bus money.
We talked 'til like two. It was this perfect evening... more or less.
And this has nothing to do with the fact that he needs a note to get out of gym.
So? Would you care to join me in our first dance as husband and wife?
Well y'know, Monica and I were friends before we started dating. So maybe-maybe that's it?
Scotch on the rocks, with a twist, on a coaster? Ha-ha, Monica! Monica!
OK, but uh, I hope you realize this means we're gonna miss hearing about the specials.
Wait a minute, wait a minute, you don't like the guy Rachel's dating? Well, that's odd.
Well seeing that drunk Santa wet himself, really perked up my Christmas.
Oh that's great! Right there! Can we get some of that over here please? There we go.
Well... we-we do. You can only eat Tic Tacks in even numbers.
Hey! Wow, it is true what they say, pregnant bellies look like a drum.
Okay, so I guess that's about ah, two weeks before the topless thing kicks in.
That's right, each. Oh, and a uh Rob Roy. I've always wanted to know...
You know, I can't believe you. Linda is so great! Why won't you go out with her again?
Joey, look, are you attracted to Monica? Right here, right now, are you attracted to her?
This is not out of the blue, this is smack dab in the middle of the blue.
Hey! Here's a dollar, consider it a deposit. Please sing at our wedding.
Yeah, jus' second. Good-bye Mr. Heckles. We'll try to keep it down.
Huh. Did, uh... any of the rest of you guys think that when you first met me?
All right. I thought about it and maybe you're right. Maybe Krog is not a safe toy.
Well, y'know if Joey and I played with matches we could get you up to an even hundred.
That's a relatively open weave and I can still see your... nipular areas.
See? Now, that's why only the little fake men are supposed to do all the kicking.
I wasn't trying to open your closet! I wasn't trying to open your closet! I swear!
Nothing! I said, I said "You're so great" and then I just, I just stopped talking!
No, it's... fancier than a pimple. Look Ross, why don't you just go see a...
No, no, but they are going to lease us a Ford Focus. I'll get out of it.
Oh that was yours? Uh, yeah, we used it when the duck was throwing up caterpillars.
Okay. You opened all the presents without me?! I thought we were supposed to do that together!
Oh, come on, there's a rest stop right up there! Come on, I really have to goooooooooo.
Is everybody else seeing a troll doll nailed to a two by four?
Well, I think it all started when you said, "Hey Joey, why don't you be my best man."
I've got nowhere to go this morning. I'm unemployed! I don't know what I'm gonna do with my life.
So uh, now that little Chandler turned out to be a girl, what are they gonna name her?
No Rach, it's not just you. My thirtieth birthday certainly wasn't that much fun.
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm trppd in an ATM vstbl wth Jll Gdcr.
If it's not, then there's two of them. And that would mean it's the end of the world!
Come on! Would you please pay attention, I could wake up at any moment!
Oh, now? No, no, I think something this nice should be saved for a special occasion.
Yes, Fran. I know what time it is, but I'm looking at the WENUS and I'm not happy!
Yeah, Karen. I'm thinking about having an affair with her. Oh, you know what? I just did.
See Joe, we want you to tell stories but y'know, romantic stories. Nice stories.
Yeah, I coulda counted to three like four times without all this 'two' talk.
No. No. We're not gonna do that, y'know why? Because its not an even trade.
Listen Phoebe, he's right. People are not supposed to have heart attacks at 31.
You not gonna believe this: She lied! She tricked me into having sex with her.
What's wrong with sun-dried tomatoes? On a barbecue chicken pizza? No?
Well uh, there was acting classes, stage combat classes, tap classes...
Yeah, I know, for a really great stew you just y'know, stick your head in between 'em.
I just want to watch a little television. What is the big deal? Geez, relax mom.
Oh well, that's uh, a little later than I uh, generally care to stay, but sure!
Look, I thought about it too, and I'm sorry. I think we should spend all of the money on the wedding.
Hey thanks. Scott Alexander, Joey Tribbianni. Joey is a uh, fellow processor.
Oh good, 'cause I've already thought of 3... 4! I've just thought of a fourth.
Oh no-no Joey, I am not going to tell you because I am an excellent secret keeper.
Well, you know what they say, elephants never forget. Seriously, good luck marrying me.
I did! A penis one! Look, just so I know, what was so wrong about what I said?
No-no-no-no, I've supported you one hundred percent and I want to prove that to you in person!
Forget it! Okay, I'm not giving up my bachelor pad for some basketball seats!
That's great. All right, I gotta get to work, I got a big dinosaur bone to inspect.
Y'know, when you say partner it doesn't sound cop. It, it sounds gay.
Oh yes! Just had me a little nubbin-ectomy. Yep! Two nipples, no waiting.
Joey, a woman just stuck her tounge down my throat, I'm not even listening to you.
Uh Joe, when it's one o'clock in the morning and you don't come by? That's okay!
Hey! Well, I've been preparing for that my entire life! Or something about you that's mean!
Hey listen, for the first four years of my work everybody called me Sha-la-lap. Seriously.
Sorry, you had a paleontologist on your face. But, uh, it's gone now, you're alright.
We don't know Bob, ok? We know me. We like me. Please let me be happy.
Anyway, I should go, one of the lifeguards was just about to dismantle a nuclear device.
The reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make a big deal out of it.
Hey, look, what do you want me to say? Do you want me to say that I'll stop seeing her?
All right, fine, you know what, we'll both sit in the chair. I'm soooo, comfortable.
Well, she's just so much fun with Joey, I just assumed, she'd still be living with him.
Yeah, because if I was at my old job we'd say 300 million? No thank you!
Oh, oh, a quality, good, because I was worried you guys were gonna be vague about this.
I'm not great at the advice, can I interest you in a sarcastic comment? Some cheese?
I'd like to go up the ladder of chance to the golden mud hut please.
Yep, we sure showed those Hassidic jewellers a thing or two about softball..
I Understand who would cancel an actual date to go to a fake bachelor party?
You got it. Good woman! Could we get a bottle of your most overpriced champagne?
This-this Fonzie person you keep referring too, is that uh, is that another doctor?
Oh, I think this is the episode of Three's Company where there's some kind of misunderstanding.
Yeahhh. I'm tellin' ya something, that ah, first smoke after nap time....
Which, by the way, is the real San Francisco treat. I got her machine.
Yeah, we were gonna give fifty, but if you guys gave more, we don't wanna look bad.
No he's, he's alright, just uh, he spends most of his time in his room.
I wish there was an easier way for us to have a child but I don't think there is one.
Ahh, Hotties of the Paleontology Department, there's a big selling calendar, eh?
Well, so, play for the next 30 minutes and then write until he gets home.
Yeah, I know what you're thinkin'! Yes, yes, your breasts are just as firm and juicy.
I can't believe I let you talk me into buying this stupid gumball machine looking ring!
Alright, ok, alright. So I can't fire Joseph but uh, I can sleep with his wife.
No I'm serious, we should tell each other everything. I do not have any secrets from you.
Look, when I've been drinking, sometimes I tend to get overly friendly, and I'm sorry.
Sure, why don't you set it up. I'll just be over here, browsing through the personals.
No, but Horny for Monica Minister called, wanting to know if we were still together.
All right, I'll tell ya what, the next time you ask me a question like that I'll lie.
Oh God, I can't believe I'm even considering this... I'm very very aware of my tongue...
Where I don't want to have a relationship ever! I just want to have sex with strippers and my friends!!
All right Rock, Paper, Scissors who has to tell the whore to leave! What?
I've actually ruined this haven't I? It's time for the good ice cream now, right?
Joey's gonna be thrilled! He was hoping you'd come by as a slutty nurse.
Girth? Why, why, why, wh-why, why, why, why would they do this?
Mr. Millionaire, new from Snooty Playthings! Third wife sold separately.
Yeah... I just don't have that much cheffing experience. Unless it's an all-toast restaurant.
Ladies, ladies, let's just compromise okay? Phoebe, Rachel take off Monica's bra.
Ah, y'see, perfect might be a problem. Had you said 'co-dependent', or 'self-destructive'...
Yeah. Yeah, but it was a really, really long time ago! Does she still feel bad?
I mean, You wouldn't want any part of me to get any bigger would you? Don't answer that.
If you guys feel this big, maybe that's not our fault. Maybe that's just how you feel.
So, Saturday night, the big night, date night, Saturday night, Sat-ur-day night!
We're going to Everest! Okay, it would be nice to leave an ass print on Everest!
And uh, you don't have a mustache which is good. I'm Chandler; I make jokes when I'm uncomfortable.
No, if crazy plate lad.. If Monica dies then I would get Emma, Right?
Oh yes, yes, we could play some other game... like, uh, I don't know... Pictionary?
Okay... You start on the image of a guy putting on the shoes. He's about my age.
Y'know what, I think we can go out there. I mean they have more important things to worry about.
Well I just, thought maybe you'd wanna book some time with the best you'd ever had.
We were playing Gin? Y'know if we were a couple, we could play this game naked.
Hey honey, you got the kind with the little girl, you said we were gonna to get the kind with the baby.
Yeah, it was time. The old condom ring in the leather just doesn't say 'cool' anymore.
All right Joey, be nice. So does he have a hump? A hump and a hairpiece?
You just said... Of course you're my best friend. Would you please tell Rachel though?
Well, let me see... I-I believe I'm... yes, falling asleep in front of the TV.
It's not gone! I mean, I'm sure you printed out a copy. You have a hard copy, right?
Oh-no-no-no! Don't! Don't! See-see, you're getting me confused, I'm starting to urn.
So you came to the room looking for Joey? Did you ever in-intend on telling me about this?
Well, second prettiest that year; I mean, of *all* the girls in Oklahoma, she's probably...
Actually, this is for Kathy's birthday. It's an early edition of her favorite book.
Hello. It's Gandolf!!! So, are you in town? Oh, well, well maybe next time then.
Okay! Okay! Let me try it again, you're gonna wanna date this next guy, I swear!
Susie Moss, right, yeah, wow, you look. . . great job growing up.
No, actually I meant my fingers. Look at 'em, look at how happy they are.
Okay. I'm gonna get the ring! I'm gonna get the ring! I'm gonna go find her and I'm just going to propose!
So, you gotta play the odds, pick somebody who's gonna be in the country like all the time.
He's a great guy, y'know? And he loves you a lot, you are a very lucky lady.
Well you should be. You missed the most powerful three hours in the history of the theater.
All right, Pheebs, back me up here, ok? You believe in that karma crap, don't you?
That's a great idea! We can easily think of a way for us both to enjoy the room.
I'm sorry, it was a one-time-thing. I was very drunk and i was somebody else's subconscious.
Here you go Joe, here's the freshly squeezed orange juice you asked for.
Well, we are fond of the silliness, but we also have a soft spot for the love.
Well, is there any chance you were looking into a bright, shiny thing called a mirror?
Alright, whoever this is, stop calling me! It's been six months! It's not funny!
Ross, just for my own piece of mind, you're not married to anymore of us are ya?
Hey! Hold on a minute, hold on a second. Do you think these pearls are nice?
Okay, okay, I tell you what. You roll another hard eight; and we get married here tonight.
Janice's birthday is coming up, I want to get her something speacial. Come in here with me.
Look, uh, just come later, we'll get everything squared away and you can come back later.
So she stole your pants and then she came back and wore them in front of you?
Yeah, can I get a 3-piece, some cole slaw, some beans, and a Coke--Diet Coke.
Y'know it's funny I started it but, now it's scary me. So could you come out here please?
Well, no, although I did have an imaginary friend, who... my parents actually preferred.
Well, it's sharp, it's metal, I think I can do some, you know, serious damage with it.
Is not as important as the fact that Phoebe took care of the babies all by herself.
I know, I know, I just always wondered if I could get her eyes to pop out of her head.
Honey, I don't like baths! Could you draw me a picture of us having sex on the balcony?
Would you all stop yelling in our apartment! You are ruining moving day for us!
Your parents caught Ross smoking pot in college and he blamed it on me!
If we hadn't lost the game they never would've invented us to dinner tomorrow night.
Yes. It's very difficult to appreciate a Thanksgiving dinner once you've seen it in reverse.
Well, y'know two regulars. And ah one that barely qualifies as... Ahh, what?
Oh yeah. Boy, urine cuts right through an ice sculpture doesn't it?
Well, I was kinda hoping we could do this without him. Oh no-no-no, leave the gloves on.
Y'know what, he's right. There's something like uh, ammonia in that, that like kills the pain.
That's so funny, 'cause I was thinking you look more like Joey Tribbiani, man slash woman.
OK, now wait a minute. That is the craziest typing test I've ever seen.
Who's number two? One of the more difficult games sewer workers play.
So, when I woke up this morning, he'd stolen all the insoles out of my shoes.
Wait a minute, is she going for spring vacation or is she going for spring break?
No! Smokes-A-Lot Lady blew smoke directly into my mouth. Eh-uh-are you okay?
This is so exciting! It's so glamorous! People taking our picture. How do I look?
It is to me. You wanted to sleep with Batman, and instead you had to settle for Robin.
I don't know. Maybe it's because it smells a little weird. It's like old pumpkins or something.
You know, I don't think we brought enough stuff. Did you forget to pack the baby's anvil?
Hey uh, Rach, funny story. I ah, bumped into Joanna on the street yesterday.
Yes, I distinctly remember 'cause I thought it was a joke. Now just give her a chance, okay?
And you did it first?! This is gonna kill him! You know how much he loves to propose!
Sir, can I ask you to umm, could you...hold out that ring and ask me to marry you?
Ken, please! No, I can't, I can't smoke. If I smoke, my wife would kill me.
I think I can safely say that we all have family issues, work stuff and/or are sick.
We can't tell him, you can't go up to a guy you barely know and talk about his.... stuff.
No, we're still together. Yeah we went out for two summers, and then I broke up with her.
Because weddings are a great place to meet women, and when I dance, I look like this...
Oh, he's in the back. The duck pissed him off, said that eggs came first.
So she was just pretending to have a good time last night? She was lying to our faces?!
Aren't you one of the stars of the popular daytime soap Days of Our Lives?
Should we tell Rachel there's an empty private room right next door to hers?
Becasue it reminded you of the way our forefathers used to bitch at each other?
Where's Monica?! Where is she? I need to talk to her! It's urgent! Is she here?
I can not believe that I am going out with someone that is getting divorced. I'm such a grown up.
Let's just say if I can't find the right CD case I just put it in the nearest one.
Yeah, that's like the most ugliest dress I've ever seen. Wh-why do you to return it?
Oh, so what you're saying is you're not completely fulfilled by Rick, Ethan and myself?
Why not, just because his great-grandmother was obese, our kids are gonna get that from you anyway!
The actor playing Mac couldn't do it, they needed to see you at 2 o'clock.
Joey ate my last stick of gum, so I killed him. Do you think that was wrong?
How can she be great if she's from Poughkeepsie? That joke would've killed in Albany.
Oh, don't thank me, thank the jerk that never showed up. Okay, I gotta get to get to work.
Okay, all right, all right, all right! Okay! Okay, here's something, here's something blue and new.
And that would have made the official party line. Monica and I are having a little financial trouble.
Okay, wait. All right, that's it, okay, I'm out of here. I am not going to be embarrassed anymore!
Oh yeah, your uh, name came up in a uh, conversation that terrified me to my very soul.
That is so weird, because every time I go to the dentist, I look down the hygienist's blouse.
Wow, this is serious. Ive never known you to pay money for any kind of capade.
Or maybe she doesn't steal stuff and Joey just slept with her and never called her back.
Did she call? You-you told her I was sick right? Always tell her I am sick!
Well, that's the part where you tell him that I moved to France. When actually I'll be in Cuba.
Where have you been?! I tried to call you! I want to talk to you! I still feel so bad!
No way! If anything you've gotta let me win! My wife thinks I'm a wimp!
That's right, I can throw her off. I can make her think marriage is the last thing on my mind.
Oh, so, forget about the birds, but big red insects suggest fine dining!
You know, Ross, some scientists are now saying that, that monkeys and babies are actually different.
I'm only going to pretend I'm moving to Yemen, it's the only way I can get rid off her.
Ooh, that girl that I hate, eww, drives me crazy, eww, eww, oh!
Hey, I'm going for sushi does anybody want.. Whoa-whoa, somebody missed the off ramp.
All right look, am I serious, okay? Tomorrow at 3:30 I am going down to the courthouse.
You didn't get more movies that are gonna have us reaching for the tissues all night did you?
You look beautiful mom. You look beautiful too dad. I love you both. I'm so glad you here.
Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs!
It did enter my mind! But then something happened that made it, shoot right out.
And the other ah, Dutch people, they come on from somewhere near the Netherlands, right?
Rachel, what is the deal with you and doctors, anyway? Was, like, your father a doctor?
Dehydrated Japanese noodles under fluorescent lights... does it get better than this?
Oh good, when he comes back for his keys, I'll be sure to give him your shoe.
Oh! Uh, yeah! Is this a cold pizza talk or a leftover meatloaf talk?
Because you know how competitive you get and well, I say it's cute, others disagree, and I'm lying!
Oh Maria. You can't say no to her, she's like this lycra spandex covered gym...treat.
I will loan you the money. Just go to the hospital and let's just get that thing...pushed back in.
You know when guys hang out they don't just drink some beer and hammer up drywall?
Let me see this guy. W-H-Wow! Don't show this to Monica! And don't tell her about the W-H-Wow!
All right, there's a nuclear holocaust, I'm the last man on Earth. Would you go out with me?
Hey. Do you want this scone? It came for me but it would probably rather sleep with you!
Well, what if we just ah, called her, used a fake name, and had her come to my office?
The weirdest thing happened at the coffee house, I think, I think Phoebe was hitting on me.
Really? Oh What A Beautiful Morning! Surrey With A Fringe On Top.
Yeah, he let us drive his Jaguar. Joey for 12 blocks, me for 15.
Listen, this is totally getting out of hand! Okay? She wants me to put lotion on her!
Y'know when I said that because we're getting married that we should share everything and not have any secrets?
Y'know what you should do, just toss 'em in the shedder and claim you never got 'em.
No, he visited a little town south of throw up. So what was Phoebe's secret?
Uhh yeah. Yeah, it's right, right down there. Right there, yeah. Can I ask you why?
Look, it's my wedding day okay? If you were getting married I would never do anything to upset you.
I don't know, I-I have to listen to both of them, they don't exactly let each other finish...
Honey, I'm gonna save you some time, 200 CDs, not one of them in the right case.
It's a traditional Mexican custard dessert...Look talk to Monica, she's on the food committee.
Uhl..ell. By the way, in case you missed that, that sound was, "Uhl, ell."
Hey, you know what I was thinking? When we get married, are you gonna change your last name to Bing?
Hey listen, come on, Joey is having a problem! A little girl is beating him up.
Well, uh, let's try one more. . . there you go, say Ernie's, 8 o'clock.
Thanks. What, let me have her?! What do mean? Like if you didn't I wouldn't have a shot?
You know what... these aren't half-bad! You should suggest something like these to Ralph Lauren.
You wanna tell secrets?! Okay! Okay! In college, Ross used to wear leg warmers!
Well the vet seems to think that's she's becoming a rooster. We're getting a second opinion.
Yo, paisan! Can I talk to you for a sec? Your tailor is a very bad man!
It means that we can keep trying, but there's a good chance this may never happen for us.
He's right, if you quit this job, you then have motivation to go after a job you really want.
It was terrible. I fought with my colleagues y'know, the entire time. Are you kidding with this?
But you're not just a soap actor. You are a soap actor with freakishly tiny feet.
Yeah, well... Y'know, it just got me thinking though, why would anybody ever want to get married huh?
Panicking! And using the Internet to try to prove that I'm related to Monica. How is she?
I need you to come to this bachelor party for my weird cousin Albert, y'know he's the botanist.
All right, look, look. What did... what did you get for Angela Delveccio for her birthday?
Well, I may be drunk, but I know what she said! Then I went over to Beefsteak Julie's...
...so then the farmer says, "That's not a cow and you're not milking it."
Well you know, we got to talking and uh, he said he needed a place and I had a spare room.
No no no. Good. So you're moving on? Do you have any idea where you're moving?
Thank you for writing your book. Its-its uh, great book and you are the queen of everything.
Right. Look, I know I'm a little bit older than you guys, but it's not like I'm Bob Hope.
You said that you paid all that money because those boots go with skirts, dresses, and pants!
All right. Now go see Miss Kitty and she'll fix you up with a nice hooker.
Ross, a sports car? Wouldn't it have been cheaper to just stuff a sock down there?
Yeah, either that, or Gloria Estefan was right, eventually, the rhythm is going to get you.
We were two miles from the house. Scared and alone. We didn't think we could make it.
I can't believe you didn't tell me! You know that the two pillars of marriage are openness and honesty!
Huh? Are, uh, any of these cultures, per chance, in the tri-state area?
Hey, so where are we staying? Is the movie putting us up in a big hotel suite?
Remember that really cold morning, you woke up and those dogs were licking your face?
Steps! Slut! You will all be very happy to hear that Kathy is sleeping with that guy!
Well I do, but uh, Eddie makes them this way and, well they're pretty darn good.
So what do you think? I want that guys genes for my kid! Those eyes, those cheeckbones!
Yes, but if it's any consolation, before the bird dropped it, he seemed to enjoy it.
Are you kidding me?! Joey. Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey!!
Oh we did, and you still have all your lamps. Chandler: Oh, I didn't factor in the room tax.
Well, if I was wearing your underwear then, uh, what would you be wearing?. . . You're swell.
Y'know what, we should all calm down because your brother's not going to punch me. Are ya?
Yeah, but that's like two blocks away from the beach. I mean, it's a total party zoo.
Well, why don't you check in one of my saddlebags while I chew on a bale of hay!
All right, let's get some perspective here, ok? These things, they happen for a reason.
Come on! Gary's such a great guy! Whatever the problem is, you can work it out!
Okay! So yeah, maybe we can get together umm... Can you hold for one second please? What?!
Its not just that shes cute, okay. Its just that... shes really really cute.
What are you still doing here? She just broke up with the guy, it's time for you to swoop in!
They don't really talk to us about that kind of stuff. I can get you some free white out though.
Yes, but these women are very hot, and they need our help! And they're very hot.
I don't know. I just had this weird sense. You know, but that's me. I'm weird and sensitive. Tissue?
I don't know! You were a delight to talk to. You asked all those insightful, great questions.
Well, I-I-I'm done with this. You want anything Ross? Sports? International? Apartment listings?
Because it says "Captain Ross" on the side and "I hate Monica" on the bottom.
Everybody at my school heard it! You were the hermaphrodite cheerleader from Long Island?!
Oh come on, by age seven kids have already seen orgies. Was it just me?!
Shhhhhhhhh!!! I'm sorry, I thought maybe I'd make some warm milk and it would help me sleep.
You know, I don't mean to brag, but I waited tables at Innsbruck in '76. Amouz-bouche?
For my last birthday you gave me a hug! Okay, read the card! Read the card!
Will you marry me? Will you marry me? Hey, you marry me! What's going on little elves?
Monica and I are celebrating our ten-month anniversary, we've got reservations at Ja George.
One. . . two. . . two and a half. OK, just show me one of them.
Well, I'm sorry Joe. I didn't think the doctor was gonna buy that it just *fell* out of the socket.
Ok, while Ross is on the phone, everybody owes me 62 bucks for his birthday.
Okay, let me just jump in and ask, at what point did you think this was a successful marriage?
Stop talking, stop talking now. Let me just get this straight. You're actually stealing my hat?
This guy invented Moss 865! Every office in the world uses that program!
You, move out. Take your fruit, your stupid small fruit and GET OUT!
Maybe she didn't move on, you know...maybe that kiss was just an impulsive one-time birthday thing.
Goin' out, huh? Wow! Wow! So things didn't work out with Kathy, huh? Bummer.
So, why is she leaving? Is it a school night and she has a lot of homework to do?
Hey, Ross, I just wanted to apologize... ..don't tell me you actually made those gay pictures of me?
Hey, y'know what, maybe we should get going. I mean what time did Chloe say we should be there?
Yes! Yes! I'm good! Are you good? Are you good? Is everything-are you-are you perrr-perfect?!
I know. Can you believe it? One year ago today I was just your annoying friend Chandler.
No, honey you're not sick! Look, I don't love you because you're organized, I love you in spite of that.
All right, you want to see if the joke stealer will let us watch the show at his place?
Well, there are other ways of winning back your money, how about a little uh, a little Blackjack?
Listen, it's kind of an emergency. Well, I guess you know that, or we'd be in the predicament room.
Well, she's aware when we leave the room. She may notice if we start... canoodling in it.
No-no, that's okay, apparently there's a new policy where we don't have to share everything with everybody.
Check it out! Check it out! When the babies wake up, they can meet Krog!
Oh yeah, yeah! Look what I got, look what I got. See, she's fully dressed, right?
Ok, go quick! Ross: Thank you for a delightful stay. Ross: Oh, my maple candy!
Okay umm, before I meant you I had really little life and I couldn't imagine growing old with...
Ooh, you know, I had a grape about five hours ago, so I'd better split this with you.
I thought we weren't gonna have bachelor/bachelorette parties! Y'know, we agreed that it was a silly tradition.
Yes, how's this: They're so uncomfortable it's like getting kicked in the nuts for your feet!
Well, I see you've had a very productive day. Don't you think the cowboy hat is a little much?
Yes, and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a child's pillow.
Okay, well he totally screwed up the punch line. Y'know, it's supposed to be arrghh-eh og-errigh.
Y'know, of all my friends, no-one knows the crap I go through with my mom more than you.
Okay. Then I guess it's just, wait here then. Hi. I need one fake ticket to Yemen.
What the hell happened?!! How were you locked in?!! And where the hell is all of our stuff?!!
Spanish midgets. Spanish midgets wrestling. Julie. Ok, yes, I see how you got there.
Well y'know, they only give you three letters, so after A-S-S it is a bit of a challenge.
No, we're playing this game I learned at work. You have to name all the states in six minutes.
Bob? Ooh, working here with us? Everyday? Yeah, I don't know if he has what it takes.
I don't know. That's the thing. I don't know what I want to do. I just know I'm not going to figure it out working there.
We'll take a brief time out while Messier stops to look at some women's shoes.
Oh, hi! Excuse me, is uh Rachel Green here? I was supposed to meet her for lunch.
Guys? I've got something important to tell ya. Guys? Guys?! I'm gonna ask Monica to marry me.
No, no, no, no, no, no No. Monica, it's Sunday morning. I'm not running on a Sunday.
I think I know what you mean though...the lamp is the hotel's, but the bulbs ...oh, you already got that.
Monica, I was wondering if you can make me some of that righteous mac and cheese like last year.
If you said, "Big lima bean, bubbling up." Would she understand the difference?
Ok, Monica, only dogs can hear you now, so, look, the door's open. Here we go.
All right, Ross, I just have to do one thing, really quickly, it's not a big deal. GET UP!!
Let me tell you about this chick I scored with last night! Oh no wait a minute that was you!
I haven't... I haven't even thought about the results yet... I just assumed that everything was gonna be ok.
Okay, well I'm gonna get Ross, get the cameras, and get them developed. 32 Joe. You're 32!
I can't believe you would actually say that. I would much rather be Mr. Peanut than Mr. Salty.
See uh, that's-that's actually what I wanted to talk to you about. I-I think I know who the other guy is.
Oh, uh, he's not here right now, uh, I'm Chandler, can I take a message, or, or a fishtank?
Y'know what would really help me through this tough time is choking something. Can I choke ya?
Kathy's with her parents, I have nothing to do, so tomorrow we are partying with Gandolf dude!
You don't, like go into the back of my closet, and look under my gym bag or anything?
By then, the cheesecake may have gone bad. We don't want her to come back to bad cheesecake.
Jeez, man did you fall.. Hi! So ah, did ya, did-did-did ya fall high?
Oh, uh, yeah... I just knew that sometimes when you're writing, you... you don't always know the exact time.
You know, I may be way out on a limb here, but do you, do you, have a problem with Janice?
Well, I relied on a carefully regimented program of denial and, and wetting the bed.
Freedom! I want my freedom! Why won't you here me?! Sophie, help me! Help me!!
Okay, could you just stop talking for a second? Yemen. That's right, yes, I'm being transferred to Yemen!
Okay, but you should know he eats five times a day and shoves pennies up his nose.
Look, it really is gonna be okay. The important thing is that we love each other and that we're gonna get married.
All right look, y'know, this maybe tough but come on, this is Ross! I survived college with him!
It was an accident. Not like I was across the street with a telescope and a box of donuts.
Yes, I told him how talented you were. I told him all about Days Of Our Lives.
OH...MY...GAWD! I am so sorry sweetie, are you okay? You didn't tell her we were getting married, did you?
Before you say anything, have we got a story for you! Guess who we bumped into at dinner!
So where are we on the whole going back to the place where they have all the marriages thing? I love you.
Well, before we answer that, I think we should address the more important question. How dumb are you?
Yes, I did. Yes, I did. Because, you're my girlfriend, and that's what girlfriends should, should get.
Thanks. Listen, about the weekly numbers, I'm gonna need them on my desk by nine o'clock.
Yes but there's six of us so we'd only have to get struck by lightning 7 times.
All right, I took the quiz, and it turns out, I do put career before men. Get up.
Look, she's really nice. Okay? And she mentioned that she adored the way that you arranged the sponges.
I don't get it neither, I mean you're obviously desperate, you're asking women how they want to be killed.
You hear that? You may not be with your families, but at least it's gonna smell like ham in here.
All right, I will help you out but you have to promise me you will not tell anyone what I am about to tell you.
Well now you understand how I feel every single day, ok? The world is my lesbian wedding.
Now, do I get to look at this book or is it just for people who are actually involved in the wedding?
Ross, what're you... what're you... what are you doing? You're having a memorial service for yourself!?
Great. It was great. She's ah, she's great, great looking, great personality, she's greatness.
Yeah, I mean when you were late last night, Kathy and I got to talking, and one thing to another and...
No, I mean, come on, seriously think about it, we get married, we're up at the altar and I'm like this.
Well, I am drinking lots of cups of coffee because I'm exhausted! Because Joey started snoring!
You know, I don't mind a... male nanny, but I do draw the line at a male wetnurse.
That's a good idea, 'Dear Janice have a Hubba-Bubba birthday'. I would like to get her something serious.
Hey, listen, I'm sorry about this afternoon, y'know, if I would've known you guys were... I never would've...
The sun'll come out...tomorrow! Bet...your bottom dollar that tomorrow... ...there'll be sun.
I will give you a hundred dollars to whistle right now. How can you eat the cheesecake without me?!
Oh yeah! Yeah, so you-you bumped into Richard! You grabbed a bite! It's no big deal.
You know, I flew a long way t see my loving wife? Is she here by the way?
Yeah, that's when if you get the babies out by the end of the month, they give you 2% financing.
You can wear them with shorts on a street corner and earn the money to pay for them.
Y'know what? I don't trust you with this cake anymore! And I got it first, and I'm takin' it back!
Oh, not with my combination of ice cubes, aloe Vera and my gentle self-loathing touch.
It's incredible, I mean one minute she's inside you and then 47 hours later here she is.
Sure! That's one of the great things about being engaged. I'm not nervous talking to pretty girls anymore.
That's what's weird? Joey, the man's been captain of a cereal for the last 40 years.
Oh, I loved the play. You were great, and Nick ditto. Clearly you're having sex with him.
Listen, I just wanted to apologize about this afternoon and the whole massage thing. Y'know? I-I really like 'em.
Her ass print is still on your grandmother's quilt, do you really want to talk about smoking?
Y'know, we don't have to watch this. Weekend At Bernie's is on Showtime, HBO, and Cinemax.
Yeah, but uh, it was 1982 and my flock of seagulls haircut was tickling her chin.
Nah, Monica's watching some cooking show. Come on, I don't want to miss when they were skinny.
Honey, isn't it possible that the company that sold the jeans made more than just the one pair?
So, shouldn't we go give her the benefit of the doubt before we go...snooping around her crotch?
Hey, y'know what you should do? You should take her back to the 1890's, when that phrase was last used.
Oh yes, and that's what I want a roommate that I can walk around with and be referred to as the funny one.
The only way that I said six would be if the seven's, let meet at seven, not at six.
Well, I then guess I'm going to Yemen! I'm going to Yemen! When we get to Yemen, can I stay with you?
OH MY GOD! When you came in I switched the channel, I was just watching regular porn.
OK, that's enough of the view. Check this out, look at this. Sit down, sit down.
Okay, well. Janice said 'Hi, do I look fat today?' And I, I looked at her....
Noo!! I don't care! I'm not, I'm not gonna playing one-on-one strip poker with you for practice!
Oh yeah, you got the big TV. We'll be over there all the time. . . except when we are here.
Hm-hmm, I told you! I can't believe that I've only got two hours before I call in sick for work.
Look all I know is when Monica and I went to see them, we had fun! And there's another reason too.
Look, I'm telling you this is just like my parents divorce, which is when I started smoking in the first place.
Yes! I'm fine. In fact I've been fine for a long time now and I think, the reason is you.
Yeah, he's really excited about it too, he even recorded show times on his answering machine.
Yeah, and then I fell asleep on the subway and went all the way to Brooklyn. Brooklyn is f-far!!
Good, good. Listen, heh, I dunno what Shelley told you about me, but, uh... I'm not.
Oh actually, I'd rather you...Yeah, go ahead. We're gonna have to burn that room down anyway.
Oh that's all right fellas, I saw a kitchen this morning - on TV. Stop talking. OK.
Umm ma'am, do you have a minute? I kind of have some bad news. I don't think I can move to Tulsa.
Aside from adoption the only other choice is insemination, so... we're talking about sperm donors.
No!! Okay!! What's with the third degree?! Why don't you just shine a light in my eyes?!
Hey, look, Phoebe I wanted to meet her in person too, okay, but she's married, she has a husband.
Yeah, oh, but I just keep picturing you rolling around with him with your cowboy boots in the air...
This coming from the man who couldn't split our 80 dollar phone bill in half.
That's still yours. Okay, now remember it's a surprise party. So, when you go in, act surprised.
See buddy, that's all you need, a bunch of toothless guys hitting each other with sticks.
Well she totally called me on it, okay. She said, 'cut it out, get real', and I did.
This is probably the wrong thing to be worrying about, but... you're getting ham on my only tie.
Really?! I-I thought you weren't looking for something serious? I thought you were looking for some kind of a fling.
Come on Chloe! Finish up with your customer first. Come on Chloe! Come on Chloe!!
Y'know I was thinking if we had a...a big fight and uh we broke up for a few hours...
What 'not work out'? I'm seeing her again on Thursday. Didn't you listen to the story?
Oh, don't worry about it I mean you probably were tired, you had a lot of champagne, it happens to everybody.
Well don't you see how gross that is? I mean that's like you using my toothbrush. You used my toothbrush?
Gunther, can I get another cup of coffee, please? So uh, what do you do when you're not working here?
Definitely roses. Well, I just think they're a little more weddingy. But Lilies are the clear choice.
Why? Why-why-would you-Wh-why... Look, I just don't want you to think that we're animals who do it whenever we want.
...also I was the point person on my company's transition from the KL-5 to GR-6 system.
Okay, give me a chance to win my money back. Okay? Sudden death, one goal, $1,000.
Yeah. Y'know I keep thinking that something stupid is gonna come up and I'll go all...Chandler. But nothing has.
I tried, but apparantly singing "I will survive" in a helium voice - not helping.
Yeah, it kinda makes that-that one night special. Y'know, technically we still are over international waters.
All right, just, just take the entertainment center, and then when you get home, throw the canoe away!
All right look, I think it's time for you to settle down. Y'know? Make a choice, pick a lane.
What I do do...is manage to uh, create an atmosphere of support for the people working with me.
well, well, well it must be five in Tulsa because it's six o clock IN NY.C!
99...100! Ready or not, here I come! All right, let's go over the concept one more time.
Well, couldn't we just lose our virginities again? Ya know, because I think actually mine's growing back.
No, she's not okay? And I'll prove it to you. I'm gonna call her right now. Phone's done ehh.
Yes, God forbid we throw out old underwear. You-you know what? I'm going to go over to Joey's.
Oh, just this! Y'know what it's my fault really, because the couch is usually where we keep the varnish.
Sure, and Joey; do not let Ross look at any of the maps or the globe in your apartment.
Um, ok... the... the fifth dentist caved and now they're all recommending Trident?
All right, this isn't so bad. I like the flower smell! Which is okay, because I've got my boat.
Hey, you have to forget about Elizabeth. I mean if you're not careful you may not get married at all this year!
I had too okay?! We're getting married! Married couples can't keep secrets from one another!
Are you just tired now or are you always tired, 'cause that could be a sign of clinical depression.
Well, she walked in when I was looking at the ring brochures. You can understand that, right? Guys? Guys?
Well, not me. But that's what's happened, and, ah, and, and there's more. We should take a trip.
Not a lot of closet space, but he can just hang his stuff out the window in a bag!
And hats off to Phoebe. Quite a competitor. And might I say your breasts are still showing.
Y'know, he won't even talk to me. How am I going to apologize to him if he won't even talk to me?
Okay, okay, here she comes! How do I look? Do I look like a guy who doesn't want to get married?
Hey, listen. I'm never going to lie to you again, okay? And I want you to know that nobody thinks you're stupid.
Oh, y'know what? The last time Joey went to a meadow, his mother was shot by a hunter.
Do you have to be a Century 21 real-estate agent to get to wear those really cool jackets?
Of course, I didn't get to enjoy any of that, because Joanna's such a big, dull dud!
Listen can you guys uh, speak up, it's harder for us to hear you when you lower your voice.
Why not?! I'd be thrilled if I heard that some hot girl was just looking to get-oh I see.
Noo!! You don't have a boyfriend because....I don't, I don't know why you don't have a boyfriend. You should have a boyfriend.
Yeah, I think that's wrong, but there's a Connect the Dots in here for you later. Hey, how about maroon?
Yeah okay, I was just talking to the guys. Just look at them I mean, is it okay if they come visit?
Well, if we're gonna do that we should come up with some kind of order. Y'know alphabetically or by genre?
Yes, back then I, uh, used humor as a defense mechanism. Thank God I don't do that anymore.
Well, of course, lambs are scarier. Otherwise the movie would've been called Silence of the Ducks.
You don't have to stop having fun just because I'm here. Kathy didn't cheat on all of you. Well, except you.
Yeah, I'd love to but I've tried that so many times they won't even let me in the store anymore.
I Think last night was great. You know, the Karaoke thing. Tracy and I doing Ebony and Ivory.
Y'know I had a big meal on Monday, y'know. So that's just gonna get me straight through the week.
Not as much fun as last time. Apparently you only get porn if you're giving a sperm sample.
Who's the bitterest man in the living room, the bitterest man in the living room? Hi, neighbor.
All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring. Now I don't know what to do, everybody starts looking at me.
Yeah, I miss that too. I tell you what; from now on we'll make time to hang out with each other.
A Speedo? Uh, I don't have a Speedo. I'm gonna go pack my regular long bathing suit.
Waitress. Got it. You guys wanna play Doom? Or we could keep doing this. What else?
What do you care? You're an actor. This is your day job. This isn't supposed to mean anything to you.
Oh, great. We have to watch him do yoga in his underwear, but for this he closes the drapes!
We can't do that that's insane. I mean 'A' he could wake up and 'B' y'know, let's go for it.
Guys, come on! Let's go! The puck drops in 20 minutes! Come on, Joe!
Well, I think I judged her too quickly, and this time we were able to take the relationship to the next level.
Putting on the sneakers... thought I'd get into a younger mindset, you know, to see if it sparked anything.
Oh I do! Op, no, wait a minute, I took it out of my shirt when I put it on this morning.
See ya. Goodbuy you fruit drying psychopath. So you want me to help you unpack your stuff?
Uh, yeah, I just got my pick-up sticks back from the shop. Bring your nerves of steel.
Well, I can't believe I've been here almost seven seconds and you haven't asked me how my date went.
The reason we haven't told them we're together is because they hate me, okay? So will you fix this?
Oh, I'm so glad we cleared that up. Look, I'm sorry, some things are different for men and for women.
Wow, Ralph Lauren is really going out of there way to show they're not in the baby buying business.
Nope, nope, I'd just ah, I'd rather talk to you. Yes, I do. Yes, I do have to go to the bathroom.
Okay, a little announcement, a little announcement. I've decided that my best man is, my best friend Gunther!
Why must everybody watch me sleep? There'll be no more watching me sleep, no more watching.
Thank God you didn't try to fan out the magazines. I mean, she'll scratch your eyes right out.
I don't know! Joey hasn't had this much trouble getting out words since we saw him in Macbeth!
Yeah, well, I'm kinda heading into a new career direction and, you know, you gotta start at the bottom.
Oh, okay Ross. Listen, this pen is kinda getting boring, so can you pick me up some porn?
Oh my God, honey we are so meant to be together. We both have copies of the Annie soundtrack.
Janice I didn't even know you were pregnant! Who's the unwitting human who's essence you've stolen?
Somewhere there is someone with a tranquilizer gun and a huge butterfly net looking for that man.
Oh, Danielle! I wasn't expecting the machine... Give me a call when you get a chance. Bye-bye. Oh God!
...I think you'll find if I come to work here, I don't micro-manage. I don't shy away from delegating.
....And then I just, you know, threw the bag of barley at her, and ran out of the store.
I don't care, I don't care! Game's over! I'm weak! I've gotta smoke! I've gotta have the smoke!
No, I just always see guys doing this when they get handcuffs taken off them. Hello sweet pants!
I just think it's weird, you know? Heckles and me, Heckles, and me, me and Heckles...Would you knock it off?
So, I finally catch up to her and she says this relationship is going to fast and we have to slow down.
Come on, you're going to Bloomingdale's with Julie? That's like cheating on Rachel in her house of worship.
She's amazing! She makes the women that I dream about look like short, fat, bald men!
I can see the headline now: "Lottery winners' friend filled with regret eats own arm".
Oh I see, I see, because of the third nipple thing. Ha ha ha ha. . .
Okay, she is the star of the play. And she is my girlfriend! I get to have sex with the star of the play!
Hey, anybody got a length of rope about six feet long with a little nouse at the end?
The only reason you're doing this to Joey is because you're bored. Okay, it's not his fault that you're unemployed.
No, no, Ross and Rachel will be back soon and then I gotta go to the office Am I producing them?
No, I don't see anything different other than the fact that the room got so much brighter when you came into it.
You tell me! Maybe, it's because I was just fooling with my ex! Oh no-no-no-no, no-no-no-no, that was you!!
Well, I didn't do anything. I didn't want to be the guy who has a problem with his boss slapping his bottom.
I was giving you some of my best moves, and you missed it. So please wake up so we can do it right!
Well, I believe the piece of furniture was fine until your little breakfast adventure with Angela Delvecchio
Hey, you know what, here's a thought. Why don't you stay home from work today and just hang out with me.
Rach, if you have a crush on this guy, why would you hire him? I mean y'know you can't date him right?
All right, look, you're not really gonna buy that are you? Don't you think you've embarrassed me enough for one day?
She did not have to tell me, I saw the play, and there was no heat. Back me up here, Ross!
Look, you can't call somebody after this long just to say, 'In case you didn't notice, I don't like you!'
Uh-huh, and I got all the top ten scores, I erased Phoebe off the board! High five!
Uh, are you crazy? Are you insane? If you live with Phoebe, you two are gonna be y'know, live-living together!
All right Mike, let's get this over with. Sudden death. Whoever wins this point, wins.
If they can't find a home for her, they kill her! And I'm not gonna let that happen to little Yasmine!
Oh yeah, it's so cool. Now I gotta go, Officer Bing has gotta, 10-100. That's pee-pee.
Come on, don't be crazy. You don't think there's someone out there better suited for Monica than me, do ya?
Nah, Nah, it's okay. I feel like I need to be in guy place. You know, do kind of like a man thing.
Look, the only way I will even consider this is if they offer a lot more than just season seats.
You have to give 'em something, you know. Okay, now that was Gerston, Santos, and who's the guy with the moustache?
Oh yeah, it's great! See you take a tennis ball, a bowl, and some lighter fluid-Op! Op!
She was.... But y'know what, just in case, maybe we should come up with a set of ground rules.
Listen Eddie, um, I've been thinking about our current living situation and uh, why are you smiling?
Yeah that was great. That was really great! But to tell you the truth, I'm more excited about where we are right now.
Well, the movie was great, dinner was great, and there's nothing like a cool, crisp New York evening.
And I love the milk! But, I'm not gonna some British girl to move in with me! Joey, you say things now.
No no, seriously, Joey's my dad, Monica's my dad. I've even got some dads down at work.
Okay, we-we swallow our feelings. Even if it means we're unhappy forever. Sound good?
Well, let's just say it's ironic how footage of someone being born can make you want to kill yourself.
It's possible. You are very loveable, I'd miss you if I broke up with you. I was just trying to be supportive.
Don't do anything. Keep it inside. Learn how to hide your feelings! Don't cry outloud.
Well, if he's gonna break up with you, maybe Joey and I should water his plants. If y'know what I mean.
Right now, right here. Don't ya think we're in kind of a public plaaaa They do have the shrimp.
Wow, Heckles was voted class clown, and so was I. He was right. Would you listen to that?
No, I didn't misunderstand, okay? She was all over me! She touched my bicep for crying out loud!
Look, we have no time okay? We must focus. We gotta get everything back into its original place.
Yeah, ok. I'm sure that doctor's office can't be worst than on a class trip to the Hershey's factory!
Nice going, imp. OK, it's OK. All I need to do is reach over and put it in my mouth.
Good! I haven't smoked yet today, I feel great, and-and-and confident, that is a stunning blouse.
I'm telling you, he's great! I mean, even if my sperm worked fine, I'd think he'd be the way to go!
I noticed you were enjoying that Ravioli with a beautiful set of teeth. Did you have braces as a child?
My wife and I have some boundary issues, you know, sometimes we ask inappropriate questions. We're working on it.
Well it's just my entire family was run out of Scotland by...Vikings. Anyway, lots of bad memories.
Ah, uh, I owe you a long overdue apology. I never should have broken up with you because you were overweight.
It's okay, the duck's using our bathroom anyway. Hey Joe! What are you getting Kathy for her birthday?
Bedroom. Bathroom. Living room. This right here is the kitchen, and thanks for coming by, Bye-bye.
No, it can mean anything. Like uh, all of the sudden you're jealous because I've become the apartment stud.
Honey, it's 2:00 on a Wednesday and I'm watching Road Rules, how stressed do you think I am?
No, no. But let me show you what I can do. "Bagels and donuts. Round food for every mood."
Hi! I'm Dorf! You're date for the evening. Oh come on! Dorf on dating, that's good stuff!!
I stayed home from work today while you were at rehearsal so somebody could be here with our chick!
Thank you! Today, my boss keep slapping my butt and he was acting like it was no big deal.
Yeah, it's like someone literally wrote down my worst nightmare and then charged me $32 to see it!
She's smart and funny, y'know? We were up all last night talking, she said the funniest thing about--what?
Oh, you dont know. Helen, could you make sure we put through the paperwork on Miss Bookbinders raise?
No, nono, don't- don't worry about it. Believe me, apparently other people have made the same mistake.
That's not backing me up! Look, you said with the off-stage and the heat, and the onstage and the oy heat.
Y'know when you guys said you were gonna go across the hall and look, you don't, you don't do that every year do you?
Don't worry, I'll be back before you know it. Yes it will be the same. Because I know, that's how. I promise.
Well, in spite of the yummy bagels and palpable tension, I've got pants that need to be altered.
I hit her in the eye! I hit her in the eye! This is the worst break-up in the history of the world.
Hey, listen, I know I came in late last week, but I slept funny, and my hair was very very &ndash;
Be-cause, we were talking about ways that he could beat Mike and I told him that Phoebe wanted to get married.
Oh, y'know what, that might be okay even if it was just kind of a fling, that might be all right with Rachel.
You've reached Monica and Chandler's, if you're listening to this message, we're probably screening. Yeah we are.
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-what-what if Martin Luther King had said that? I kinda have a dream! I don't want to talk about it.
Ah well, she's got this weird idea, that, uh, y'know, just because you and I are alone, that something is gonna happen.
Who says you can't get a nice punch bowl for under six bucks? Maybe we can take it back?
What're you kidding? I broke up with her. She actually thought that Sean Penn was the capital of Cambodia.
Oh yeah? Joshua, give me a call sometime, guys like you never go out of style-what did you throw away?
I pity the fool who puts on my jewelry, I do, I do. I pity the fool that. . . Hi!
Oh, we wanted to finish the crossword before we went to bed. Hey, do you know a six-letter word for red?
Oh Joey's got a really bad hernia, but that's nothing a little laser eye surgery won't fix!
Y'know what Gunther, go ah, go ahead, I'm-I'm talking to ah, . This is the part where you say your name.
Well, maybe we can fix it y'know? Maybe we can send him some-some big-big flowers and scare him!
Ah, the "I'm sorry I rejected you" phone call. I'm not used to getting it from guys. Hey, Steve.
All right! Fine! I'm going. But when I get back it's chair sitting, and I'm the guy who's....sitting in a chair!
I hope you know what I'm giving up for ya, because she's not just the boss in your office, if you know what I mean.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you! And you are about to marry a wonderful man! Hey! I'm marrying a dead woman!
Mr. and Mrs. Geller, you look wonderful, it is great to have you hear, let us take off your coats!
They are needy, they are jumpy, and you can't tell what they are thinking, and that scares me a little bit.
Somebody wanna help me, tryin' to rip out my heart. Uh, that's great. Anybody seen a nipple?
Yes, I did. I told it to Dan at work, and he said it was the funniest joke he'd ever heard.
Is this really your long term plan, for me to run interference? Because I could get a job any day now.
When it comes down to it, you would risk your life for Ross before you would for me. That's the bottom line.
All right, kids, I gotta get to work. If I don't input those numbers,... it doesn't make much of a difference...
Excuse me? You don't think I could get a Brian? Because I could get a Brian. Believe you me. ...I'm really not.
Well, as old as he is in dog years, do you think Snoopy should still be allowed to fly this thing?
As bad as that went I actually enjoyed myself. I think that I'm going to apologize for all of the stupid things I do.
I do limericks... uhm... There once was a man named Chandler, whose wife made him die inside.
Because you broke a chair and you broke a chair! The only one around here that hasn't broke a chair, is me!
Oh, uh, I... don't... care. Ok, now, remember, no trading. You get the pretty one, I get the mess.
So what the hell happened to you in China? I mean, when last we left you, you were totally in love with, you know.
Where the hell is everybody? Bitter lady: Why don't you like me?! Chapter One: My first period.
Of course, of course not. I just have to uh, go over to the place where I-I made it and pick-pick it up.
Okay, uh, how about, how about-y'know what? We could play a new game. A new game, it's fun.
Well, maybe it was the kind of food that tasted good at first but then made everybody vomit and have diarrhea.
Okay, all right. I just spent the entire afternoon looking for a present for Kathy that would be better than the rabbit.
No, no, no, no, no, NO! No, no... we're not together. We're not a couple. We're definately not a couple.
Whoa, whoa, so I'm guessing you didn't get the part, or... uh, Italy called and said it was hungry.
Hey, I hear that you and Joshua are going out to dinner with Ross and Emily, and I think that's, I think that's really cool.
Deposit my specimen? You know, usually I have to call a 900 number for that kind of talk. Thanks, got it.
Now, there is a dress laid out on your bed. Okay, you're doing great. You're doing great. You're doing fine.
I like this girl, okay, I seriously like this girl, you now how sometimes I tend get a little defended and quipy...
Out of my league. I could get a Brian. If I wanted to get a Brian, I could get a Brian. Hey, Brian.
We should start with the big stuff. Y'know? That'll be the easiest. Uh, let's start with the couch. I got it.
Yeah, I think I do! Y'know what? You move in with her! You move in with her right now! Maybe I should in with Monica!
Oh that's right. It's your first day! So are you psyched to fight fake crime with your robot sidekick?
Will power? I've watch home movies of you eating ding-dongs without taking the tin foil off.
Alright, so I'm back in high school, I'm standing in the middle of the cafeteria, and I realize I am totally naked.
I got a good one, I got a good one! I once walked in on both my parents making love to the same guy.
They couldn't be worse. I spent eight hours calling him last night, just trying to get him to talk to me.
The... Jamestown colony of Virginia. You see, King George is giving us the land, so...
I did! But the store wouldn't take her back! So then I took her to the shelter, and you know what I found out?
Well, ye, yes, actually, but, uh, they were my Aunt Edna's, and there were three of us in there.
Okay, I accept that. When Janice asked me and I said no, she took that to mean that I was calling her a cow.
Oh yeah, gym member. I try to go four times a week, but I've missed the last 1200 times.
No, see the thing is I want to get out of here before Joey gets all worked up and starts calling everybody bitch.
You slept with somebody three hours after you thought you broke up. I mean bullets have left guns slower!
I know, just quick-quick question, quick question. Which one was Deep Impact and which one was Armageddon?
...Couldn't enjoy a cup of noodles after that. I mean, is that ridiculous? Can you believe she actually thought that?
Well, I have an appointment to see Dr. Robert Pillman, career counselor a-gogo. I added the "a-gogo."
Oh yeah, but don't worry. I don't think anybody's gonna focus on that as long as your wearing that towel dress.
Well it's kinda hard to be friends with Drake because of his busy schedule and the fact that he's not real.
Uh, Joey is gonna be right back. Right back! Meanwhile, let's-let's-let's talk about you. So, you're old and small.
Say Ross, when you picture Phoebe living on the street, is she surrounded by the entire cast of Annie?
But come on, look at how cute and small this is! So I got it to give Monica so she'd know I was okay.
I wasn't sure which one Mary-Angela was. Look, I'm sorry okay, I was really drunk, and you all look really similar.
Well, she probably wasn't familiar with the process having spent most of her life sitting for oil paintings!
Ha-ha-ha--enh-enh. I'm so glad you guys are all here! My office finally got wrinkle free fax paper!
Oh, yeah, I don't know what they were doing, but at one point sea turtles actually came up to the house.
Yes, how 'bout a verse of Killing Me Softly. You're gonna sneeze on my fish, aren't you?
Oh, yeah, easy for you to say, you don't have to walk around sporting some reject from the Mr. T collection.
Sorry, I just don't like the idea of when I say, "I do," he's thinking, "Yeah, I'd do her too!"
Wait a minute, it's perfect. We got a lot of time to kill and we're in a building that's full of beds!
Hey, sorry I'm late. Congratulations, Mon. I'm not sorry I'm late. How incredible was my afternoon with Jade?
It's just that we bought a hibachi together, and then he ran off and got married, and things got pretty ugly.
Yeah, well look at this kitchen, slash bathroom. Well that's great! Y'know so you can cook while in the tub.
Oh my God, the air purifier! Ross's air purifier! All I heard through 4 years of college was
Well this is great. Y'know, those cameras were the only thing that was gonna cheer Monica up today, she's really depressed.
Y'know, I-I could see how this could happen, y'know you're up there every night, you're naked, touching, kissing.
Oh. Oh right! Right! Because you're still seeing him and uh, he's a good guy. I mean, I remember a time when...
Oh, it's a website, it's the, uh, the Guggenheim museum. See, she likes art, and I like funny words.
I'd just like to say that I'm totally behind this experiment. In fact, I'd very much like to butter your head.
Oh, it's not important? It's not important?! If it wasn't for a bride's maid you'd be marrying him not me!
All right! Ten buck! Fork it over! Cough it up! Pay the piper! Gimme it.
What, you never look down in the shower? Oh please. I'm not allowed to make one joke in the monkey-is-penis genre?
Oh I just got another rejection letter. They said my writing was funny, just not "Archie Comic funny."
How do you feel about the, "I really did forgot the present, please forgive me" not fake out?
Yes! And look, now that I know if I got some extra stuff lying around can we, can we share the closet.
Oh, it doesn't matter. Hey, y'know what, I've got two tickets to tonight's Rangers game, you wanna come with me?
Could be. I mean technically she did strip, we just, we just missed it. Ma'am, are you also a stripper?
If you're cooking on the stove, does that mean that your new secret boyfriend is better in bed than Richard?
Yes! It's flown into your blouse and you'd better undo your buttons lest it sting you!
Hey Rach, now that you're working at Ralph Lauren, can you bring me back some of those polo shirts?
Yeah, we talked and Monica made me see that I over reacted a little bit and some things in life are more important.
Ooh-hoo. Very hot, very sexy. But ah, y'know she's too international, y'know she's never gonna be around.
I had about a mugful in this lovely 'I got boned at the Museum of Natural History' mug.
Oh-ho, liked what she saw, huh? Dug my action, did she? Checkin' out the Chan-Chan man!
Yes, and I get my ya-yas from Ikea. You have to put them together yourself, but they cost a little less.
I asked myself that very question, sir. Uh, this is Monica. This is my boss, Doug. Doug this is Monica.
That's alright, I'll take it. Bad things happen to me anyway. This way I can break 'em up with a movie.
I... thought it was a timely start to thinking about other people. Besides, this gift still says I love you guys.
Okay, it's not a check. They're saying your health insurance expired because, you didn't work enough last year.
Hey, you guys in the living room all know what you want to do. You know, you have goals. You have dreams. I don't have a dream.
I'm so pathetic! Monica knows what she wants to say! You should've seen her. Writing, writing, writing!
Ugh, we have already proved that we are hot! Okay? So why-why are you getting so obsessed about this thing?!
All right. Yes. Okay. I get your point. But if it's not your bra will you just let the woman clean the apartment?!
Actually, in Oklahoma smoking is legal in all commune areas and offices with fewer than fifteen people.
But hey, it's courtside. The cheerleaders are going to be right in fr. . . That's not the way to convince you.
Well, I was trying to prove that I was right. Y'know? And it turns out I was wrong. And now it's lodged in my throat.
....three years of modern dance with Twila Tharp! Five years with the American Ballet Theater?!
Now that's so funny, because last Christmas I got the gift of space. We should get them together and make a continuum.
I am sorry, but some of us have to get up early and go to work! He does not know that I am not some of us.
Hi.... um... okay, next word... would be... Chandler! Chandler is my name, and, uh... ...hi.
Y'know what, I can handle it, handle's my middle name. Actually it's the ah, middle part of my first name.
How... exactly are you pursuing that? Y'know other than sending out resumes like what, two years ago?
So did Monica tell you about this great band called the Swing Kings that we're trying to get to play at the wedding?
We share a wall! So either he's great in bed, or she just likes to agree with him a lot.
Don't worry, I'm brave! I am brave! I...I am brave! No-no-no-no!! Can you tell me who is there please?
Oh, no-no-no-no. Last time I left a spontaneous message I ended up using the phrase "Yes indeedy-o."
No, no the gravel capades. Yeah, the turns aren't as fast but when Snoopy falls. . . funny.
I don't know if I've told you this, but he's kinda tried to get in contact with me a lot over the last few years
Alright, OK, alright. But if we put on spandex and my boobs are bigger than yours, I'm goin' home.
I'm sorry, he's a little bit wound up, we had to stop at every maple candy stand on the way here.
Oh no no no, she's a total wack job. Yeah, she thinks that Joey is actually Dr. Drake Remore.
Right. You know what? Actually I just get off the plane, so I'm feeling kinda gross. Maybe I should just take a shower.
Well, thanks a lot for hookin' me up Rach. I want you to know that I want you to attend our wedding as my guest.
That was a celebration of life. Alright, look, I'm not gonna do this. Alright, is this really the way you want a baby to be conceived?
No. No, see when I first meet somebody it's uh it's mostly panic, anxiety, and a great deal of sweating.
Well, she spent the last six months getting over him, and now she's celebrating that by going on a date with him.
Bladder Control Problem Stop Wife Beating Hemorrhoids? Winner of 3 Tony Awards...
I don't know, I don' I don' know! I was just trying to get into a young mindset, you know, and it just started to flow.
Well what... Y'know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna go over there; I'm gonna kick his ass! Will you help me?!
I don't think I have to hear the rest. Advertising makes perfect sense. Sorry you had to waste all this time, though.
And you... Ross, I believe, if you check Rachel's bag you will find a half-eaten box of cookies in there.
But wait a minute though, how are we gonna get there, though, because my Mom won't let me cross the street.
Yeah, y'know what I got a better idea. How-how 'bout it blocks none of mine door and a lot of yours?
Hey! I need you to set me up for a joke. Later, when Monica is around, I need you to ask me about fire trucks.
Yes. Okay, there's this one guy, Patrick, I think you're gonna like him, he's really nice, he's funny, he's a swimmer.
Just do it! Okay, it's Janice and if I get it I'm going to have to see her tonight. Oh, that's great I'm gonna have to see her tonight.
Well, it's because I trust you, you're one of my best friends, and you walked in on me when I was looking at ring brochures.
Oh y'know, I've been living here a while and I've never seen what's inside that closet. What is, what is in there?
Very, very funny, but don't say things like that in front of Monica. I don't want you putting any ideas in her head.
Come on. An 80-foot inflatable dog let loose over the city. How often does that happen?
Thanks, it's ah, Gaelic, for 'Thy turkey's done.' So ah, I'm gonna go, nice, nice meeting you.
Right, I mean, come on, I'm sure that if you had a funeral or a memorial service, tons of people would come.
All right, Janice, likes him. In fact she likes him so much she put him on her freebie list.
I don't know; I'm not used to girls making passes at me! ... Wait a minute... am I sexy in Oklahoma?
Oh, yeah, right, OK... inlcuding the waffles last week, you now owe me... 17 jillion dollars.
Nooo!! She's really dull! And she gets this gross mascara goop thing in the corner of her eye!
Hey, by any chance did either of pick uh Rachel for your secret Santa, 'cause I wanna trade for her.
OK, what is it about me? Do I not look fun enough? Is there something. . . repellant. . . about me?
Look at her go! She must love me more than I love her! What's wrong with me? Ooh, don't open that door.
Wait, if we're lucky, and we're really really really quiet, we may be able to hear the sound of a condom breaking!
I was just at the bank, and there was this really hot teller, and she didn't ask me to go do it with her in the vault.
Well, I'm upset-for you. I mean, having sex with an endless line of beautiful women must be very unfulfilling for you.
So how come Richard's selling the place? Went bankrupt? Medical malpractice? Choked on his own moustache?
You called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a Santa costume, so I borrowed one from a guy at work!
Oh yeah, that was great. Thanks to you, the hottest cocktail waitress there is quitting to teach the third grade!
I-no! I didn't read the box before I opened it. And you can't return a box after you've opened the box.
Yes, the moon, the glow, the magical feeling, you did this part- Could I get some painkillers over here, please?
What a minute, I know that hat! I was taken aboard that hat! They did experiments on me! I can't have children!!
But I'll tell you something. One of these days we're get off of our buts and rent Die Hard again!
Don't you think it's better for him to think that you're cheating on me, than for him to think that I'm cheating on him? I heard it.
Oh hey listen, don't be mad at him, it's our fault. I'm sorry we've been hoggin so much of his time.
Listen, if you want to borrow money, its kind of a bad time. I'm buying dinner for 128 people tomorrow night.
If marriage worked, I'd be all for it. But do you know what the divorce rate in this country is? 97%.
Mrs. Tedlock. You're looking lovely today. And may I say, that is a very flattering sleeve length on you.
Oh! Some guy. Some guy. 'Hey Jill, I saw you with some guy last night. Yes, he was some guy.
Oh, who should I blame? The nice bell man who had to drag out luggage to 10 different rooms?
Because he's crazy. Okay? He came up to me earlier and thanked me for my very moving performance in Titanic.
What an interesting approach to guitar instruction. Y'know some might find it amusing, I myself find it regular.
Yeah or also when you don't have somebody breathing down your neck ALL THE LIVE LONG DAY!!
I was not staring at her. Okay? I was just listening intently. It's called being a good conversationalist. Watch. Say something.
Well, I heard that you thinking about asking Phoebe to move in with you and I thought maybe, we should have a talk. Man to uh, me.
No-no! This is my fiancee and her heart was set on that ring. You don't want to break her heart now do you?
Y'know, I forgot the combination to this about a year ago? I just carry it around. Do you have any Chap Stick?
Man, if you tried something like that on my birthday, you'd be starin' at the business end of a hissy fit.
Kathy! Kathy! Hi!! Kathy! Kathy! Kathy! Fetch! Fetch it! Kathy! Kathy! Kathy! Kathy! Kathy.
Yes, on a scale from 1 to 10, 10 being the dumbest a person can look, you are definitely 19.
What? There was ice there that night with Carol? Plastic seats? Four thousand angry Pittsburgh fans?
Says here that a muppet got whacked on Seasame Street last night. Where exactly were around ten-ish?
Oh-ho, come here. Listen, you are one of my favourite people and the most beautiful woman I've ever known in real life.
Janice, I have something I need to tell you, and I want you to let me get through it, because it's, it's, it's not gonna be easy.
Well, you couldn't get them anyway. Ian doesn't plan anymore and Derrick... And Derrick is a name I shouldn't know.
Look, for the first time in my life I'm in a real relationship. Okay, I'm not gonna screw that up by y'know, telling the truth.
Why yes Ross, pressing my third nipple opens the delivery entrance to the magical land of Narnia.
Ah, Kim Basinger, Cindy Crawford, Halle Berry, Yasmine Bleeth, and ah, Jessica Rabbit.
Alright, I'll tell you what, you call the couch and then, and then we'll call the couch, and we'll see who it comes to.
Yes, Joey has a very careful screening process. Apparently, not everyone is qualified to own wood and nails.
Hey, you're not him. You're you. When they were all over you to go into your father's pipe-fitting business, did you cave?
Yeah, Joe, I assure you if I'm staring down the barrel of a gun, I'm pretty much peeing every which way.
Yes. She was smart, she was pretty, and she honestly cared about me. Janice is my last chance to have somebody.
Wait a minute, wait. You're telling me this actress person is the only woman you ever wanted who didn't want you back?!
Yeah, I can be a hero, I could do that. I could, I could do... I, w-w-what if, what if it attacks me?
Exactly. Weekend At Bernie's! Dead guy getting hit in the groin twenty, thirty times! No?
So um, after you put the suggestion in the box, how long did it take for the roller skating thing to happen.
Oh no-no-no, you don't want to do that, then you're gonna get stuck with Rachel and she exchanges every gift she ever gets.
Oh yeah, I had no idea the amazing journey you go through as a woman! Tell me, tell me about your first period!
I don't have anything against the beautiful guest room, especially since everybody we know lives about 30 seconds away!
'Candy and Cookie'. 'Candy and Cookie?' Monica got me porn?! Girl-on-girl porn?! She really must love me!!
Calm down? Calm down? You set me up with the woman that I've dumped twice in the last five months!
Oh yes, sir! Put me out of my misery. Are you sure you never played pro? Please let them win!
"Look, this is ridiculous! I'm not paying for that room! Ok?" "Oh, thank you very much!" Yeah, I'm going to Vermont...
You don't turn and slide, you throw it out! I'm tired of having to get a tetanus shot every time I get dressed!
Let her know I like her? What are you, insane? It's the next day! How needy do I want to seem? I'm right, right?
Wish it! Hi. Hi, I-I was just sitting over there, and uhh, Chandler. My name is Chandler. Did I say that?
Oh, come on! It's not like this is an everyday occurrence for me! I mean usually I'm pretty much just in there by myself.
Say your son never feels connected to you, as one. Say all of his relationships are affected by this.
One nation, under God. Indivisible with liberty and justice for all. I remembered it. The champagne is here.
Ah, I don't know, you tell me. Anything you ah, wanna tell me, because, if you ah, you should, if you, you would, tell me.
Why don't you cut him a little slack? Okay? Maybe if he relaxes a little bit, he'll get some work done.
Hi. We're the guys who called about the baby. We left the baby on ths bus. Is he here? Is he here?
Well, it'll probably slow it down at first but, once I get used to the extra weight, I'll be back on track.
Now, that's a lot harder than it sounds. You always forget at least one, or in some cases... fourteen .
Great, because my shoes are giving me a little problem on the dance floor, can I borrow the boots from your costume?
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I found this great place called "Invisible things for Kathy." Can you give me a hand with all this stuff?
Yeah, and at the end of the play, he, he got up y'know, and he just started like, banging his hands together!
Yep! And! A beautiful woman agreed to go out with me. Joey wanted to ask her out, but uh, she picked me.
I'm not in charge of where the conference is held. Do you want people to think it's a fake conference? It's a real conference.
I have a weird feeling about this place. How do I know that they are not gonna secretly videotape me and put it all over the internet.
I don't know! He went crazy! Y'know, we were playing that game where you-you ask a question and you answer it really fast.
Well, I think it's great that you're going on a date, you know? I mean, it sounds healthy. I mean, you have needs. Embrace your womanhood!
Oh yes! Bye Bye Birdie, starring Joseph Stalin. Joseph Stalin is the Fiddler on the Roof.
You know what, everybody? Go home. You should be with your families. It's bad enough that we're working New Year's Eve.
How can I not be upset? Okay? I finally fall in love with this fantastic woman and it turns out that she wanted you first!
So explain something to me here, uh, what kind of a relationship do you imagine us having if you already have a husband and a boyfriend?
Yeah, we have all this paperwork that needs to be filed by the end of the year. If I don't get it done, I'll be fired.
All right, look, if you insist on wearing that, in public, y'know, you're gonna spend the rest of the afternoon all by yourself.
Yes, yes I am. Err, listen, the reason that I called you in here today was, err... please dont hate me.
And I'm the happiest guy in the world! Oh honey, come on don't be upset. We still have so much to look forward to!
C'mon, I'll show you to my room. ...That sounds so weird when it's not followed by "No thanks, it's late."
Veronica. Look, it's got to be Veronica, the girl in the red skirt. I definitely stuck my tongue down her throat.
Because that's where Joey gave me some stuff to store that I've never seen before in my life! Okay, that did not just happen!
Oh! Thanks, I'm crazy about our place. Hey! speaking of crazy... do you have a history of mental illness in the family?
Oh, the duck seems to think that Monica got me garbage! Hmm, I wonder what I could get Monica that's as good as garbage?
Well, let's just say that Krog will be fully equipped to destroy the universe again in twelve to fourteen hours.
You know, you should really go on this show. All right, listen, I got three tickets to the Rangers tonight. What'd ya' say?
Okay, look, Joey! Come on, think about it, first of all, he'll never be President. There's never gonna be a President Joey.
Well, I'll stay, but only because I wanna hear about Hanukkah. Ben, will you sit here with Santa and learn about Hanukkah?
All right, should we just, should we just get married? Y'know? I mean should we just do it? All the signs are telling us to do it.
Yeah Ross, I mean... we're excited to hear the speech but the rest of the time we're gonna wanna do, you know, "island's stuff".
Yes. Yes, and ah, ah, the trees are happy too, because for most of them, it's the only chance to see New York.
There's gonna be a wedding. You're gonna be the bride. Two hundred people are going to be looking at you in a clean white dress.
Oh, I thought you were great in Silence of the Lambs. Oh come on, admit it! All things considered, you had fun tonight.
Um, absolutely. Uh, how 'bout tomorrow afternoon? Do you know uh, Central Perk in the Village, say, five-ish?
All right, who keeps leaving old newspapers in the trash?! I really wanted to take Kathy to this, I can't believe I missed it.
Whoa-ho, whoa! No, I was thinking about y'know for me, as a part of that whole getting over Janice thing you were talking about.
Oh, no, no, I'm an intern, just like you guys... except for the tie, the briefcase... and the fact that I can rent a car.
Oh, yeah. I'd marry him just for his David Hasselhoff impression alone. You know I'm gonna be doing that at parties, right?
No-no-no! I am the king of bad Thanksgivings. You can't just swoop in here with your bad marriage and take that away from me.
You mean these tuxes have been down the red carpet with people yelling, "You are you wearing?! You look fabulous!"
Well, I don't know what Big Leon told ya but it's an even thousand if you want me for the whole night. What is this for?
April 18th, excessive noise. Italian guy's gay roommate comes home with the dry-cleaning. Well that's excellent.
So tell me something, is leaving the Christmas lights up part of your plan to keep us merry all year long?
Well, I think you should seriously consider the marriage thing, give Rachel another chance to dress up like Princess Bubble Yum.
All right look, if you absolutely have to tell her, at least wait until the timing's right. And that's what deathbeds are for.
Ah, look on the bright side, I mean you won't have to live with this ugly chair! That was here already huh? I love you.
We're trying to get pregnant. Y'know I'm not really comfortable doing this in front of the babies. So, when do you want to start trying?
Yeah...I mean I want this so much! I mean, I wanna get one, I want my friend Charlie to get one...Except I don't care about Charlie.
You know I think he will be surprised, 'till he realizes he's a monkey, and uh, you know, isn't capable of that emotion.
I know. You're right. I want to see you too. I've just got to figure out a way to tell Joey, you know? He's really looking forward to this.
I will tell the story! It was going great. I let him win. We were bonding. He even said I could call him dad.
It's a tradition, like the parade. If the parade decided it was gay, moved out, and abandoned its entire family.
Eh, yeah, well ah, waitress at a coffee shop and cheer squad co-captain only took up so much room.
Then we will sprinkle rose pedals on the bed and make love. Not just because it's romantic, but because I can!
We're doomed. Okay, they're gonna take 50 bucks out of our accounts for the rest of our lives. What are we gonna do?
I'm gonna hold him a different way. Look I don't understand, if you hated it so much, why did you buy it in the first place?
Well, we have a deal, where we each get to pick five celebrities that we can sleep with, and the other one can't get mad.
Oh hey! There's some kids playing in the street, you wanna go down there and give them a project, ruin their day?
Well it couldn't have been worse. A woman literally passed through me. OK, so what is it, am I hideously unattractive?
Yeah, this is so good, that I'm gonna go enjoy it on the balcony so that I can enjoy the view whilst I enjoy my dessert.
Okay well, this side looks bigger. Uh... There's more crust on this side. Y'know? So, maybe if I measured...
Honestly? Our apartment is a hotbed for electromagnetic activity. Now Monica and I have been immunized, but sadly you have not.
Yeah, listen, how cold is it going to be there? Do I need a coat or will all these sweater vests be enough?
Ooh, Lambchop. How old is that sock? If I had a sock on my hand for thirty years it'd be talking too.
Yeah, listen, Joey isn't gonna be here tonight so why don't you come over and I'll let you uh, feel my bicep. Or maybe more.
Well, I'm sure you'll teach her a lesson when she steps off the dock onto nothing. Hey Mr. Douglas.
Look, I'm not saying that you should magically forgive me! But you're not perfect! You've made some errors in judgment too!
You're right, and I'm sorry! This means a lot to me! I want you to be my friend again! I swear, I won't say another word tonight.
Yep, we're a couple and that's what couples do. And, I wanna meet your parents. We should take a trip with your parents!
Oh yeah, that's what she says. But maybe you're not ovulating at all, maybe it's just a clever ruse to get me into bed.
So you understand, I'd feel a lot more comfortable if you didn't tell people what happened. Y'know, I'm a little...I'm a little embarrassed about it.
Y'know? So I was thinking that we could get one of those signs and hang it over our bed. Because, that's you and I together! Merge!
You are incredible. Unless, I...I'm not gonna smoke again. And if I do, I promise, I will hide it so much better from you.
Okay! I was gonna wait 'til uh, it was official y'know? But I got so excited I just had to tell you guys because you're my best friends.
Oh, that would be Monica. Hey, listen, I wanna borrow a coupla things, Aurora spent the night, I really wanna make her breakfast.
Let me ask you, why is everybody using these tiny lights nowadays? I remember when people used to use big lights.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, it just seems that Robert isn't as concealed in the shorts area, as ah, one may have hoped.
Yeah, I'm gonna stick with the ring. Oh, this one's nice! I like this one! Sir? Uh, kind sir? Can I see this one?
What if I never find someone? Or worse, what if I've found her, but I dumped her because she pronounced it "supposably"?
Math!! You're giving me math! All right, look y'know what, forget about it, you go for the girl, we'll see who gets her.
We are going to have a legitimate member of the clergy! And when I say legitimate I mean, gay and in control of his saliva!
Here's a picture of Ross. And that's me. And that's me and Ross. Oh-ho, that is a picture of our first kiss as a married couple.
Okay, so that's it, everybody knows! It's official, we're moving in together. No turning back. Are ya scared? Are ya?
Eh, y'know what, she's to political, she probably wouldn't let you do it, unless you donated four cans of food first.
Hey, it's me. I know you can't stand to be in the same room as me, so I just thought I'd try and apologize over the phone. All I...
Uh, credit card. Oh no! No-no, but I left my credit card with Joey. Okay, I'll go get it. You guard the ring.
Ross is wearing leather pants! Does nobody else see that Ross is wearing leather pants? Someone comment on the pants!
I'll try, but I'm not sure what good it would do, y'know? Because I'm a lot less afraid of commitment than I used to be.
That's right! I do! And I'm your man. And I'm going to get us through this situation even if it means you working twice as hard.
Well, you have to honest with her! Otherwise you may think that you're going down the same path, but you're really going down different ones.
Did I not tell *anyone* about New Year's Eve? -- Alright, look, go! Go home, okay? Merry Christmas! Go.
Oh come on! He said he was going to do my inseam, and he ran his hand up my leg, and then, there was definite...
Well Joey, I'm a headhunter. I hook up out of work Soviet scientists with rogue third-world nations. Hi Rasputin!
Okay, I will do it. But I have to warn you; this may make me a better person and that is not the man you feel in love with!
Because, if Santa and the Holiday...Armadillo? ...are ever in the same room for too long the universe will implode. Merry Christmas!
Young! You're a man-child okay?! Now go get changed because everybody's ready and please, oh please, keep my underwear!
Well, you may wanna rethink the dirty underwear. This is basically the first time she's gonna see your underwearyou want it to be dirty?
I know what you meant!! You notice that ever since we got this chick, we've been fighting a lot more than we used too?
But we had one of the greatest talks we ever had last night. I mean it was, it was like when we first started living together.
This is about you and Richard. He's clearly not over you. He keeps a tape so he can... look at it whenever he wants.
Yeah, Ross sure is a great guy, y'know I've always felt that how a young man turns out is a reflection on his father.
Yeah, you know, I really thought I deserved it. But... let's go win the lottery... I mean, we still have 130 chances to win, right?
Well, doesn't the fact that I wore the bracelet even though I hated it say something about our friendship and how much it means to me?
Look, I-I'm just gonna be right across the hall and I promise you, the minute Monica and I break up I'm moving right back in with you!
It was unbelievable. I-I've never met anyone like her. She's had the most amazing life! She was in the Israeli army...
No, Stephen Hurs was the kid who would eat anything for money, David Stein was the guy who had no elbows.
Okay, but this is the last time. With a chick-chick here, and a chick-chick there. Here a chick, there a chick, everywhere a chick-chick--chickeeeen.
Well, I have a girlfriend, I'm-I'm happy. So, I no longer feel the need to go out of my way to stop others from being happy.
And err, he informed me that uh, she took the news rather badly, in fact, he uh, mentioned the word frenzy.
Yeah, it's like when you're a kid, and your parents put your dog to sleep, and they tell you it went off to live on some farm.
Alright. Once I got on the subway, right, and it was at night, and I rode it all the way to Brooklyn... just for the hell of it.
Stretchy pants! Why, those are the greatest things in the world! If I were you I would wear them every day, every day!
You guys haven't actually met before, but, boy! You're both polite! Go to have a seat Zack, and I'll get you a beer.
Okay so you mean no as in, "Gee Chandler, what an interesting idea. Let's discuss it before we reject it completely."
Well, what? What? What is it? That she left you? That she likes women? That she left you for another woman that likes women?
Phoebe if it helps Alexandra has only been massaging Monica for like three years. If! I said, "If it helps!"
Yes, I do. Now, I may not understand why you have to win so badly, but if it's important to you then it's important to me, because I love you.
Oh, come on. What was with that whole Black Bart speech? : "When I play poker, I'm not a nice guy!"
Oh-oh, yeah, and did he also say that ah, some of the dialogue was corny and that he actually found it was funny and not sexy?
Secret? Married people aren't supposed to have secrets between one another. We have too much love and respect for one another.
So Ross, how was your date the other night? Did you tell her about the magical ride that starts with the flush of every toilet?
Oh, listen. If this is about those prank memos, I had nothing to do with them. Really. Nothing at all. Really. Nothing.
All right. I'll tell you what. When we're 40, if neither one of us are married, what do you say you and I get together and have one?
Ugh. Just a sec, give me a minute to wake up for this-Ah-ha-ha!! You lost the ring! You're the worst best man ever!
I'm not gonna watch it... I don't NEED to watch it... I mean, what good could possibly come from watching? Well, we know I'm gonna watch it.
Well what is wrong with me? Am I .. am I incomptent? Because I managed to survive whatever it is that killed the three of you!
Uh, Yes. Yes. Ive just been going over your data here, and little thing, youve been post-dating your Friday numbers.
Look, I may have jumped the gun here. Um, I just got out of a relationship and I'm not really in a, in a commitment kind of place.
No, no. It-it's not about the swearing, it's more about ah, the way, that you ah, occasionally, concentrate, your enthusiasm on my buttock.
No-o-o! No? No-o-o! Look Joey, here's the thing, Monica and I have decided to live together, here. So, I'm gonna be moving out man.
This is unbelievable. Its been like a half an hour. If this was a cartoon, youd be looking like a ham right about now.
So, whaddya say boys, should I call him? Well, ya know what they say. Ask your slippers a question... you're going crazy.
Well, maybe he had some kind of uh, new, cool style, that you're not familiar with. And uh maybe you have to get used to it.
Alright, Janice, that's it! Janice... Janice... Hey, Janice, when I invited you to this party I didn't necessarily think that it meant that we-
Well, I'm off to Tulsa, so if your Maitre D. friend has any funny Oklahoma jokes, tell him to e-mail me at www.hahanotsomuch.com.
Look, Ross, you have what you want, you're back with Rachel. If you bring this up now you're gonna wreck the best thing that even happened to you.
Well, come on, I've been saving this money for six years and I kinda had some of it earmarked for the future, not just for a party.
Hey, look Joey, I'm just saying if you need something to hold you over, I can get you a job right here as an entry level processor.
Okay, here is the thing. We have thrown a very formal surprise party for you in there! All of your friends are in there and your parents!
It means that my guys won't get off their barcaloungers and you have a uterus that is prepared to kill the ones that do. It means...
Well the package says you have to uh, constantly keep it moving. Stir and drink, stir and drink, never let it settle.
Look, maybe I got carried away before. But there's something you gotta know. If I'm the best, it's only because you've made me the best.
I know, I know, but you're gonna have plenty of chances. There are literally thousands of women out there just waiting to screw me over.
That's good one too, Pheebs. Now all you have to do is find a planeload of people who's resolution is to plummet to their deaths.
No. All right, y'know what, she's gonna think that I'm handing you a credit card, but what I'm really gonna do is hand you a library card.
Hi, um, I'm account number 7143457. And, uh, I don't know if you got any of that, but I would really like a copy of the tape.
C'mon, Ross! You, me, Joey, ice, guys' night out, c'mon, whaddya say, big guy, Huh? Huh? Huh?
Or 'You're such a nice guy' means 'I'm gonna be dating leather-wearing alcoholics and complaining about them to you'.
It doesn't matter because nothing beats a three and a six. That my friend is D-Cup. Okay, now much have you won so far?
Hey, you're gonna be fine. You're one of the most caring, most responsible men in North America. You're gonna make a great dad.
He was asking all these questions about you, me, and London. And, of course the glue that holds this all together, the rules.
Maybe 'cause the last one was made by Pepperidge Farm. Look Eddie, isn't there something else you're supposed to be doing right now?
I know there'll be many moments in the years to come when I'll regret asking the following question, but- And Andrew is?
Hey, Joe, I gotta ask. The girl from the Xerox place buck naked , or, or a big tub of jam.
Y'know what? I can't believe this! Do you know what you did? My girlfriend is out there thinking things over! You made my girlfriend think!!
Look what do I do? I wanna get past this, I don't wanna be afraid of the commitment thing. I wanna go through the tunnel, to the other side!
You're arranging flowers! You got dead flowers! You got a picture, a picture, of a baby dressed like flowers! This is not Joey!!
Oh hey Rachel, sweetheart? You have got to tell the post office that you have moved. Okay? We are still getting all your bills and stuff.
Ross! You gotta stop! Okay?! You can't just stare through the peep hole for three hours! You're gonna get peep eye!
Okay. Here's a question you never have to ask. My dad just called and wanted to know if he could borrow one of your pearl necklaces.
You know, I don't get this. A month ago, these people were my friends. You know, just because I'm in charge doesn't mean I'm a different person.
No. This is just part of a dare devil game that I play called 'wait until the last moment before I burst and die.'
I walk into a room and he won't even talk to me, he just mumbles something in Italian. And I know he only knows the bad words.
Okay-dokay, you've each won a game and I've lost what's felt like a year of my life. So everybody goes home a winner.
I am so sorry. I really am. I was an idiot back then. I rushed the stage at a Wham concert for crying out loud!
Well, that's what we do. Y'know, I-I mess up and then you tell me how to fix it and then I do and then y'know you think I'm all cute again.
Well, that's like money in your pocket! - Alright look, you want me to say it? This sucks. Being here sucks! This work sucks!
I don't know, but don't worry, don't worry, because I know how to take a picture now. Okay, see? Look down , look down, look down...
That's a good plan, Joe. Next time we wanna pick up women, we should just go to the park and make out. Taxi, taxi!
I don't know what to say. I'm sorry that we make more money than you. But we're not gonna feel guilty about it. We work really hard for it.
I know. See, yes. That's Yasmine Bleeth, she's a completely different kind of chick. I love you both. But in very different ways.
Actually, can I get some hot water with a little lemon? I think I strained my voice screaming in there. Does it have to be so loud?
Extremely allergic, okay? If I'm anywhere near a dog for more than 5 minutes, my throat will just close up!
No! I just happened t'do a lot trivias about smoking in different states. For example, in Hawaii cigarettes are called Leyhallalookoos.
Rachel got Ross the tuxedo that Val Kilmer wore in Batman. Okay Batman is so much cooler than James Bond!
Hey, I can be smooth. Listen, we're a little bit in a hurry, so, if you can get us a table a little quicker, I'd appreciate it.
No-no, he's not back yet, but he'll be here any minute. So uh, come on in. Have a seat. Bow or stern?
Okay. Okay. Yes honey, I made it myself. I can't do it. I can't do it. Oh! Oh! A mixed tape! A mixed tape!!
Oh, it wasn't a big deal. I just went to a couple of bookstores, talked to a couple of dealers... called a couple of the author's grandchildren.
It doesn't matter. I just don't want to be one of those guys that's in his office until twelve o'clock at night worrying about the WENUS.
I'm sorry. I, I told you I was in Tulsa because I wanted to spend the night with Monica and I, I didn't know . . . I didn't think you'd understand.
Knock-knock. Who's there? Ross Geller's lunch. Ross Geller's lunch, who? Ross Geller's lunch, please don't take me. Okay?
Yeah, well I went to boarding school with four hundred boys. Any sex I had would've involved a major lifestyle choice.
Well appealing as that does sound to her boyfriend and her brother, I can't do that we promised we'd make each other gifts this year.
No! No! I don't want him to know we're yet! I'm not sure I'm ready for that. And besides he's not gonna be too happy to see me either.
She's really going to love this, you know? The bottom line is I want her to have it, even if I don't get to be the one who gives it to her.
Well, you know Phoebs. I don't know if it's your kinda thing, because it involves a lot of being normal. For a large portion of the day.
Hey-hey-hey Rachel, funny thing. Actually, the ah, end zone starts at that pole, so you're five feet short, so we win!
Well, y'know, you're-you're gonna meet somebody! You're a great catch! Y'know when I was telling all those guys about you, I didn't have to lie once.
Well, I'm guessing he wants to do a little dance. . . ya know, make a little love. . . well pretty much get down tonight.
My Catholic friend is right. She's distraught. You're there for her. You pick up the pieces, and then you usher in the age of Ross!
Oh, yes. Well it's very beautiful. It's cream-colored and tight I don't mean tight, I mean it's not too tight, not that I was looking at-
Say, Joe, I had a strange idea of what we could do for our last night. What do you say we play a little uh, foosball for money?
Okay, last night at dinner, when the meals came, she put half her chicken piccata on my plate and took my tomatoes.
Come on, Ross? Remember back in college, when he fell in love with Carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?
Oh, yeah! Absolutely! Anything you need man! But you have to promise me the second you are feeling better so that we can make fun of your hair!
I mean I was nothing before you. Call the other girls and ask. Which wouldn't take long. But when I'm with you, and we're together, OH...MY...GOD.
Oh no no no no, no no no no no no, you see, what I had planned shouldn't take more that 2, 3 minutes tops.
See that's where I think that you're wrong. We've been playing these babies man for man; we should really be playing a zone defense.
Is that a hint? Because we love you Doctor Connelly but we don't think we'd want you to be our child! Wow, talking about an inhospitable environment!
I think we have some time. Have you ever heard him talk? "Uh, Phoebe, uh, I would be honoured, uh..." Spit it out, David!
My diary! My diary, that's brilliant. I should have told her it was my diary, she never would have made me read her my diary.
Okay, bye, champ. Now, I know there's gonna be a lot of babes in San Diego, but remember, there's also a lot to learn.
Yes-yes, I was just trying to figure out a way to uh, demonstrate how I could get my exceptionally large feet into my even bigger mouth.
I know, me too. Hey! Y'know what if we went away for a whole weekend? Y'know we'd have no interruptions and we could be naked the entire time.
Yeah, I mean, there's probably gonna be some ground work which will probably stink, you know, grown man getting people coffee is a little humiliating.
All right, y'know what? Forget it, all of you forget it! You've ruined it! Go home! You've ruined it! You've ruined it!
Lie!!! How hard is that?! The check's in the mail! Oh your baby is so cute! I can't wait to read your book Ross!!
Buh-bye. I just got us reservations at Michelle's and tickets to the Musicman to celebrate our first holiday season as a betroughed couple.
Me too. I wanna find a baby that needs a home and I wanna raise it with you. And I wanna mess it up in our own specific way.
Varrrrrroom! Hey! Watch it lady! Varrrrrrrrrrom! Hey-hey good lookin'! Varrrrrrrrroom. All right, I'll leave. My bed's so boring.
Yeah, well I don't think you can make that statement, unless you've been kicked in an area that God only meant to be treated nicely.
You guess I'm right? When we stayed at that bed and breakfast, you wouldn't have sex with me because you thought a deer was staring through the window.
Well, my secretary is gonna be out for a couple of weeks. She is having one of her boobs redused. It's a whole big boob story.
This is nuts. This is crazy. She came over for like two minutes, dropped off a fish tank, and left, end of story.
Yeah. Good call, nice one. Hold it!! Hold it! What if me eyes are closed, and, and my hand is out there....
Eh, forget about the future and stuff! So we only have two kids, y'know? We'll pick our favorite and that one will get to go to college.
Can you believe it? I mean, don't I seem like somebody who should be doing something really cool? You know, I just always pictured myself doing something...something.
All right buddy, time to roll over. No-no! No, no-n-n-n-no!! You are going to a clinic! You're going to a clinic, and a pyjama store!
No-no, wait! There's got to be a better explanation. You can tell them you had to make an adult film for your adult film class.
Okay, okay, a little announcement, I just want everyone to know that the position of my best man is still open! And uh, so is the position of the bride.
Well, I'm crazy about her now. I think this could be the real thing. Capital 'R'! Capital 'T'! Don't worry, those are the right letters.
Oh that's great! Great! Thanks! But that dress I mean it's like yuck! It's terrible! It makes me wanna just rip it right off of you!
I don't know what that's like?! Up until I was 25 I thought the only response to, "I love you," was, "Oh crap!"
Drop off my dry cleaning. Pick up my vitamins. Teach me how to spell vitamins. Wear in my new jeans.
Y'know, I uh.. just thought I'd throw this out here. I'm no math whiz, but I do believe there are three girls and three guys right here.
Why?! I mean if this guy was me and it was me who had learned that it was me who was the best you'd ever had, I'd be going like this.
Y'know what this is like? This is like when my parents got divorced. Man, I hope Ross doesn't try to kidnap me after Cub Scouts.
OK, I don't, I don't mind the last pound. OK, in fact I kind of like the last pound. OK, so don't make me do anything that I'll regret.
That's not really important right now. What is important is; while we appreciate the gesture, we just don't feel bagpipes are appropriate for our wedding.
Dude, you have got to turn on Behind the Music. The band Heart is having a really tough time, and I think they may break up.
Funniest guy she's ever met! I'm funny, right...? What do you know, you're a door... You just like knock-knock jokes... Save it for inside!
Okay, our news. My company has asked me to head up our office in Tulsa , so as of Monday I'm being officially relocated.
Wow, it sounds even cooler when somebody else says it. I was awesome, ok? She was biting her lip to stop from screaming.
No, but wait-what if I bought it from you, y'know? And your nice gesture would be giving it to me at a reasonable price, say $1,500?
So is he housetrained or is he gonna leave little bathroom tiles all over the place? Stay. Good, STAY! Good fake dog.
Come on, Monica, things could be worse. You could get caught between the moon and New York City. I know it's crazy, but it's true.
Because you've only known her for six weeks! Okay, I've got a carton of milk in my fridge I've had a longer relationship with!
No! Uh, I d'know! The point is, if you were gonna set me up with someone, I'd like to think you'd set me up with someone like him.
Look Ross, if you don't know them by now, you will never know them, okay? That is the beauty of this game. It makes you want to kill yourself.
Finally, I figure I'd better answer it, and it turns out it's my mother, which is very-very weird, because- she never calls me!
This isn't one of those uh, y'know "If she doesn't come, we-we don't, we don't come?" Right? Because I already bought my ticket...
No, no, no-no-no. I smoked for years, then I quit. Right now, I can't remember why. You're not allowed to smoke in this office. Not right?
Oh, that's not true. You had an impact on me, I mean, it's 15 years later and we're still best friends. Doesn't that count for something?
Joey, it's been three days, okay.. Your just a little homesick, Okay. Would you just try to relax. Just, just try to enjoy yourself.
Hang up, hang up. And that was a great movie! I'm so gonna get back at Ross... oh yeah, this will show him, here we go .
Yep! From now on its gonna be the four of you guys and me and the misses. The little woman. The wife. The old ball and chain.
So this is nice! I wish I didn't have to go, believe me! But unfortunately I have to. Oh uh, by the way, what's the name the girl you're dating?
Yeah I know, but I figured a shot y'know? Maybe one of those stories would make me cry and then you wouldn't think I was y'know, all dead inside.
Yeah! It's a stupid job, and I could not stand leaving you. And why should I be the only one who doesn't get to do what he *really* wants to do?
I had to! Okay, imagine you were married... and you found a tape of your wife in another guys' apartment... Wouldn't you need to know what was on it?
That would be no. Look, just because you played tonsil tennis with my mom doesn't mean you know her. Alright? Trust me, you can't talk to her.
Oh, come on Monica, reliving past pain and getting depressed is what Thanksgiving is all about. Y'know, for me anyway. And of course, the Indians.
Okay first of all, the impression, uncanny. And second, that was not flirting, that was just casual conversation between two people. That is all.
Joey! Joe! Full bag. Beer's still cold. Something terrible must've happened here! Oh no-no-no-no-no-no! Stevie, I was never here!
Look I'm very glad that you saved Ross from the car backfire, but y'know, it could've been a bullet and you y'know, you didn't try to save me!
Oh, well... Maybe I'll join them some time. I just hope the club doesn't slip out of my hand and beat the moustache off his face.
You kidding? You're the most beautiful woman in most rooms... Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What's going on? You and I just made out! You and I are making out?
Now all you have to do is just get through a little bit more, okay? Then we can put you in bed, okay? Just smile and don't talk to anyone.
Your just, your just clearly not familiar with our young persons vernacular. See, when we say dad, we mean buddy. We mean pal.
I'm sure that would mean a lot to him. And if heaven has a door, I'm sure he's pressing his ear up against it and listening intently.
I figure that $1,500 would cover him for a few months, y'know? But I have to trick him into taking it so I won't hurt his pride.
Here's the thing, Janice. You know, I mean, it's like we're different. I'm like the bing, bing, bing. You're like the boom, boom, ... boom.
Joey, Joey. Hey, some girl just walked up to me and said, 'I want you Dennis,' and stuck her tounge down my throat. I love this party.
And weenie number two has it. Unless, of course, nine-down, Knights in White Satin was sung by the Doody Blues.
Janice! There you are! There you are! I had to have one last kiss, and also-also you said that you were going to leave right after I got on the plane!
Oh-aw my God! Now, I understand if you never want to sleep with me again, but that would be wrong. We're too good! We owe it, to sex!
Well he doesn't have to know! It's not like we run in the same circles. I hang out with you guys, and he stars in a drag show in Vegas.
That was an obvious joke, and I didn't think of it. Why didn't I think of it? The source of all my powers. Oh dear God, what have I done!
You can always spot someone who's never seen one of his plays before. Notice, no fear, no sense of impending doom...
Let me finish ... however, it doesn't look like I'm gonna get this job so I can't afford to have principles, so screw you, the tickets are ours!!
Yes, hitting her with a frying pan's a good idea. We might wanna have a backup plan, though, just in case she isn't a cartoon.
I'm hoping that when Bob doesn't show up, she will seek comfort in the open arms of the wry stranger at the next table.
All guys that are awake. Then we go to sleep and then all the guys from the other end of the world wake up and behave the exact same way.
Y'know what? I have been trying to apologize to him all week! If he's not gonna let me do it on the phone, I'm gonna go down there and do it in person.
Okay, then you gotta back away, all right? You don't need that kind've hurt. Take it from a guy who's never had a long term relationship......
It could be less than a year. I mean, you've heard my stuff. "Pants. Like shorts, but longer." It'll probably be more than a year.
But uh Ross, Ross is a great guy! I was roommates with him in college. Uh, funny story... You're roommate in college died didn't he?
oh, oh, yeah, ok, thanks. I can't believe I didn't even think of that. I guess I was just so worried about having to... come here and do... 'that'...
Y'know, if I won $5,000 I'd join a gym, y'know build up my upper body and hit Richard from behind with a stick!
And yet, believable. So I decided not to fire her again until I can be assured that she will be no threat to herself, or others.
Well, I got a job interview. It's kinda a big deal too. Its a lot more money and I'd be doing data reconfiguration and statistical factoring.
Well, I think, I think, Ross already has one. Now, this one's free, right? Because you paid for the first two, so the third one's free.
Nope... Hey... so I'm gonna... put the plates back. You know, I think you were right, I don't think we should use these plates again for a looong time.
I'm telling ya, Joanna's got it all wrong. Okay? All I said was, 'This was fun. Let's do it again sometime. I'll give you a call.'
I'll take that bet my friend. And you know what, paying me the 50 bucks could be the "new thing you do that day!" And it starts right now!
See, I'm finding out all this stuff about you today, like you like the Law & Order and that you flirted with every guy in the Tri-State area!
Yes, we don't get married unless there's a sign! Okay, so say uh, say you roll another eight then there's a definite sign that we should get married.
Oh, I can't believe my sperm have low motility because, let me tell you, when I was growing up they sure seem to be in a hurry to get places!!
I'm not freaking out. Why would I be freaking out? A woman named Heldi called and said we were getting married, but that happens everyday.
Y'know what else I can't believe? I had to kiss Phoebe and Rachel every time I left a room, I mean it's too bad they didn't see us having sex.
You gave them one day's notice, not everyone in our class checks the web site everyday and Monica... it's probably the way you stand!
Well, we're talking about sperm donors and Zack may be the guy! I mean, look, he's intelligent, he's healthy, he's athletic, I mean, he is "spermtastic"!
OK, alright, last minute lesson, last minute lesson. Joey... three... eight. Eight... three. Alright babe, deal the cards.
Expect it in 4-6 weeks. Umm, hey, umm, Joey's gonna be at the telethon for the rest of the day, we have the whole place to ourselves.
You are an amazing wife. No really you're amazing you were actually gonna do this for me, I mean where do you find the strength and understanding over something like that.
All right, say you do that. You know sooner or later somebody's gonna come along that slices a better cheddar. And then where're you gonna run?
Huh! So that's what I would look like if I worked out... and was being serviced by a policeman. You're not actually going to send these out are ya?
Yeah, well, you wouldn't think it was cool if you're eleven years old and all your friends are passing around page 79 of 'Mistress Bitch.'
Alright look, if it means that much to you, a may be able to get on more with the big boobs. But the giant ass and the big clown feet?
Yeah, but its not who I am. Everything they said was exaclty why I was worried about having a kid. And its true. And look everybody knows it.
Right on! Oh! Uh, but, don't take to long okay? 'Cause uh, we're gonna test out our fake ID's tonight, right Clifford Alverez.
If you clear things up with Rachel then Ross never needs to find out, but you have to do it now before he hears about it and kicks your ass!
Okay, it's his first time out, so he's probably gonna wanna do some of the touristy things. I'll go to Cats, you go to the Russian Tea Room.
Well it's just while Monica and I were dancing to them it was...the first time I knew that...you were the woman I wanted to dance all my dances with.
Yeah, yeah, I think it looks pretty good. I was a little worried I was uncovering a birthmark right aboutthere, but it turned out to be a little piece of chocolate.
Yeah, well sure, when he did it, it was funny. When I did it to my boss's hat. . . all of the sudden I have this big attitude problem.
See, this is the brilliance of the show. I say always keep them running. All the time, running. Run. Run Yasmine, run like the wind.
Yeah, sure. What do you need? We got lace, satin, sateen, raffia, gingham, felt, and I think my testacles may be in here too.
It's about cutting my people a little slack, ya know, for morale. Look, if you wanna see some rough numbers, I can get them to you by Wednesday.
Well yeah! But now that I know that you're having these thoughts, I'm back to panic, anxiety, and uh I'm definitely gonna need some kind of sports drink.
Okay, I've been doing a lot of thinking about us, y'know a lot of uhh, us thinking. And uh, well I guess there's only one-one way to do this.
Yeah, well, sorry doesn't bring back the little piggy that cried all the way home! I hate this stupid day! And everything about it! I'll see you later.
They're these prototype sneakers and come up with ideas on how to sell them which I can't do because no self-respecting adult would ever where these.
Now sweetie, I know you don't like my office parties, but you can wear your new boots. See? Every cloud has a...supple leather lining.
Ah, let's see. What next? Blow a bubble. A bubble's good. It's got a... boyish charm, it's impish. Here we go.
No, it's not like, like Phil Spiderman. He's a spider, man. Y'know like ah, like Goldman is a last name, but there's no Gold Man.
I'll tell you what, for the rest of our lives, I'll be careful until told otherwise. hey wait a minute this isn't the china we picked out..
It's a funny story, actually. I kind of fell asleep in the meeting this morning so when I said I'd move to Tulsa, I didn't really know what I was saying.
No, it's like all of the sudden, we were this couple. And this alarm started going off in my head 'Run for your life! Get out of the building!'
Hey, y'know, I have had it with you guys and your cancer and your emphysema and your heart disease. The bottom line is, smoking is cool, and you know it.
Trust me, you don't want him there either. Okay? Nobody is gonna be staring at the bride when the father of the groom is wearing a back-less dress.
Ahh, I believe my exact words were, 'Flaign,en - sten'. I mean I didn't know what to say, how do you know if you wanna do it on an elevator?
If I turn into my parents, I'll either be an alcoholic blond chasing after twenty-year-old boys, or... I'll end up like my mom.
Joey kept screaming at me, "Do it now! Do it!! Do it! Do it now!!" Sometimes late at night I can still here the screaming.
OK, I'm officially unpacked. Thanks for helping me man. Joe? Well, I guess Joey went home. Oh and look, there's still one box that I have to unpack.
Alright, alright, alright. It's been fourteen and a half minutes and you still have not said one word. Oh God, do something. Just make contact, smile!
I'm not gonna talk to her, she obviously got my message and is choosing not to call me. Now I'm needy and snubbed. God, I miss just being needy.
Well, I could make it seem like he's here. "Here's some little known facts about cous-cous. They didn't add the second cous until 1979."
Made a few calls, pulled some strings, and they agreed to seat us at 11:30 if we both had the chicken and didn't get desert.
Phoebe, did you see that?! He totally checked you out! He is so cute! Mine has a picture of The Village People, what does that mean?
Come on, Ross, you gotta get back in the game here, ok? The Rachel thing's not happening, your ex-wife is a lesbianI don't think we need a third...
Yes, yes I did, but what I didn't say was what I was about to say, what I wanted to say was, uh... would you like to go out with me sometime, thankyou, goodnight.
Look at these videos. You know, I mean, who does he think he is? Magnum Force, Dirty Harry, Cool Hand Luke... Oh my God!
The Bings have horrible marriages! They yell. They fight. And they use the pool boy as a pawn in their sexual games!
Yeah, just some 9-year-old Filipino kids who worked their fingers bloody for 12 cents an hour. That didn't happen, I made that up!
And you're thinking of taking it? So before you said being me with me was more important than any job, but I guess now it's old job, me, new job.
You hear that! That is her chose, mister I'll let you have her! I win! You suck! I rule all! A mini-wave in celebration of me!!
This is okay. We're all adults here; there's nothing to be ashamed of. Now, let's put our underwear in our pockets and walk out the door.
That's actually why. Look, I'm starting a whole new career now, and I'm not saying that I don't want to have a baby, I'm just saying maybe we could wait a little while.
That's our phone number. Now look, I know I kinda sprung this whole me moving out on thing, so why don't I just-why don't I just cover you for a while?
Ya know Phoebs, don't feel so bad for 'em. After they're done playing, I break out the little plastic women and everybody has a pretty good time.
Oh yeah, I just showed this a picture of you and guys were throwing themselves at me! They're buying me drinks! They're giving me stuff! Knicks tonight?
Joey's not a friend. He's...a stupid man who left us his credit card. Another drink? Some dessert? A big screen TV?
No. I mean I believe that uh, certain people are more suited for each other and I believe in falling in love, but soul mates, I don't think they exist.
I know you probably don't want to go out with me, y'know because I make too many jokes and I've never been in a serious relationship and I guess I'm not technically a "doctor..."
Good morning everyone, it's nice to see our team together for the first time. Now, before we get started, are there any questions? Yes, Ken is it?
All right look, if you're not gonna stay for me, then at least stay for them! Okay, they have had a very difficult year! What with the robbery and all!
You bet I did, Ben, put it there! Well, it would have worked this time, if his hands weren't so damn small! Ho, ho, ho!
Well, she seems very nice and everything, but that whole thing about her coming all the way down here, just to see if I was okay? I mean,... how needy is that?
Y'know that thing that Ross was gonna do at our wedding?! He was hanging out with me yesterday and he turned to me and said, "You're half Scottish right?"
Y'know what I think it is? It's the fishnet stockings. Y'know? Whenever I see a girl in fishnet stockings it reminds me of my father in fishnet stockings.
Well, listen I ah, still have one more person to ah meet, but unless it turns out to be your sister, I think you're chances are pretty good. All right.
Thank you, Mister Drunken Gambler! Okay, you get this and uh, we get the biggest suite in the place! Wait-wait-wait-wait! We get the biggest suite in the place.
Don't think of it as a cigarette. Think of it as the thing that's been missing from your hand. When you're holding it, you feel right. You feel complete.
Yeah! If-if-if we did do this there would be a lot of pressure on me, y'know? Because you've been waiting a very long time and I wouldn't want to disappoint you.
No! No! I support you 100%! I just didn't, I didn't get it right away. Y'know now I'm caught up! Identical hand twins! It's a million-dollar idea!
Tomorrow night is good. Tomorrow night is good, but uh, y'know what? Why put off something till tomorrow that you can do right now? Eldad come here!
Oh my God. What is th... it's like a guy never lived in here. Look, you've got to be careful. This girl thing is dangerous. It's spreading already.
Well, wait there's, there's more. See the contact paper is to go into your brand new drawer. See, the drawer actually goes in my dresser.
Okay. Uh, we'll dim the lights, dim the lights. Or turn them out all together. Uh, no scented candles. Okay here. Here we go.
Oh, and don't get me wrong, I appreciate the sentiment. It's just that I, I have a rather, sensitive posterior, and ah, besides, it's making all the other guys jealous.
Thank God, because I don't wanna do this either. You know, I was just doing because I thought that was what you wanted to do. You know, I'm the husband, I'm supposed to... bring the sperm.
I got good. I played this game all day and now I rule at it! They should change the name of it to Ms. Chandler. Although I-I hope they don't.
Oh no..don't thank me. Thank you. You know there's not one thing I would change about you? Not one single thing! And definitely not... two... single things.
Well what's the difference? Your eggs aren't here anymore, are they? You took your eggs and you left. You really expect me to never find new eggs?
No, I invited him to dinner so you could get a chance to get to know him! I mean, if we go through a sperm bank you never meet the guy, get to check him out.
All right, we haven't had sex yet. Okay, what's the big deal? Y'know? This is special, and I want our love to grow until we move on to the next level.
Yeah, she was at Rockefeller Center skating with her husband, she looked so happy. I almost feel bad for whipping that kid's pretzel at them.
Well actually uh, there was something we wanted to tell you about the wedding. Um, it's going to be a small ceremony. Uh, tiny! We're not even sure why we're having it.
That's not true! I wanted to wear my bathrobe and eat peanut clusters all day. I wanted to start drinking in the morning. Don't say that I don't have goals!
Y'know what? Forget it! We are just hungry! We have not had lunch! We are just light-headed! So let us go out and have lunch and forget about the cheesecake.
Yes, I-I know that you do, but I think one of the reasons people were complaining though, was that they paid to hear the actor sing Old Man River.
Oh, see, I had to tell her that my number was your number, because I couldn't tell her that my number was my number because she thinks that my number is Bob's number.
No, the best reason to get married is pregnancy. Sorry is pretty much fourth y'know, behind being ready and actually wanting to get married. Will you be my wife?
Alright you guys are off to party number one and you, you are off to party number two Alright fellas, let's keep it movin', let' keep it movin.
Yeah! If the car that backfired had run over you! Y'know what, I think I'll go home before Ross starts rambling about his newfound respect for life.
Okay, I get it. So, I get nothing! Nothing here is mine! Everything here is yours! I'll get up in the morning put on your clothes, and head off to work!
No, no, no, no! No, no, no, no! It's okay, it's okay. I didn't go. Don't cry, it's just a bit! I'm your uncle Chandler; funny is all I have!
Yeah! No! No! No! Don't fall asleep! Okay, I am going to make you some coffee. And I probably won't spill coffee grounds all over the kitchen floor.
Y'know, it'll be okay. It'll be okay. Because when they come over, I will be all charming, I will make them fall in love with me, and then we'll tell 'em.
Now Monica, I know you're upset, but don't forget. There is going to be a wedding, you are going to throw the bouquet, and then there's going to be a honeymoon, maybe in Paris.
Oh no, it's terrific, it's... it's... y'know, you deserve this, after all your years of struggling, you've finally been able to crack your way into showbusiness.
Yes, it does bother me! And I think it would bother a lot of people. Rachel, when you were going out with Ross, did it bother you when he flirted with other women?
Of course I am. I reject anyone who's crazy enough to actually go out with me, and then I bitch about the fact that there aren't any great women out there.
Well, look it's been a really emotional time y'know, and you've had a lot to drink. And you've just got to let that go okay? I mean you were the most beautiful in the room tonight!
You know me sir. Oh ah, I do have a question for ya. Do you know how I get around the office computer network so I can access the really good Internet porn?
I hear ya, Mugsy! But look, all these rooms are fine okay? Can you just pick one so I can watch--have a perfect, magical weekend together with you.
I'm sorry! Hey-hey Joe, why don't you uh, lift up your shirt? Take a look at this kiddo. We have a crying child! Roll the damn cameras!
I was dangerously dehydrated during the first six months of our relationship. Look, for me the rush is knowing that we are gonna be together for the rest of our lives.
Oh well, not as lovely as you. I mean, I can't believe that you would have a thirty-year-old daughter! And you! I can't believe that you would have a tux that's thirty years old!
Don't go! I'm sorry. I'm so sorry! Look! This guy fell asleep! He fell asleep too! Be mad at him! Or, call an ambulance.
And here is the bottle of wine for you to bring over tonight. You were also going to buy Monica flowers but you couldn't afford it, because you paid dinner last night.
It's football... It's just football... This is great! This is the first time I've ever enjoyed football... It may be customary to get a beer... What the... What are you doing?
No! Ok, this is not good. You are a guy. Ok? This is a guys place. If you let this go, you're going to be sitting around with your fingers soaking in stuff.
Good save! We're back on track, and I'm... ..chewing someone else's gum. This is not my gum. Oh my God! Oh my God! And now you're choking.
Ok, Janice. Janice. Hey, Janice. Look, there's no way for me to tell you this. At least there's no new way for me to tell you this. I just don't things are gonna work out.
Are you telling me that you bought the chair that is making all other lounge systems obsolete? The chair that Sit magazine called the Chair of the Year?
Look, we've always talked about having babies someday. I'm not saying it has to be right now, but I'm starting to think that we can handle it. We're good. We're really good.
That's not what I had in mind! See, people like Ross don't generally wear these types of pants. You see, they're very tight. Maybe there's something in that area.
No, I can't. No-no, listen, I, I know how much this means to you and I also know that this is about more than just jewelry, it's about you and me and the fact that we're best buds.
Wait a minute, wait a minute, I see where this is going, you're gonna ask him to New Year's, aren't you. You're gonna break the pact. She's gonna break the pact.
Well... there's surrogacy, but Monica has dreamt her whole life of carrying a child, she has felt that watching a surrogate would be... too hard for her.
Oh, is this about you-you dating the nurse? Yeah, Joey already told me, and I am so-so fine. I mean, you and I we're just, y'know, we're nothing, we're goofin' around.
Alright, lo...look. I don't smoke anymore. But if the rest of you want to light up, go ahead, it's fine. So you all smoke then? That's almost rude, that I'm not.
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What is all this pressure?! Is this some new kind of strategy? Why don't you put down your copy of 'The Rules' huh mantrap?!
Pretty well. Except for the stapler thing. Little tip: if youre ever in a similar situation, never ever leave your hand... ..on the desk.
Hey, you have nothing but talk about her for the last 48 hours! If you were in a school yard you'd be pulling her pigtails and pushing her down now!
Well apparently Albert has no friends. He's very excited about the bachelor party though. I think actually the only reason he's getting married is so he can see a stripper.
I see, but once you get your first paycheck you'll be springing a big hotel suite, right? I mean, lead in a movie, they must be paying you a lot?
Okay, okay, but don't worry, because we also have cereals, muffins, waffles, and, jams, jellies, and marmalades. Which I'm fairly certain are the same thing.
It was fine, y'know? But she didn't agree with me as strongly as she agreed with Joey. She was more like, "I see you point, I'm all right with it."
Wait. Before we go in, I just want you to know I love you. I had a great time on our honeymoon, and I can't wait to go in there and spend the rest of our life together.
No, I can't. No no, listen, I, I know how much this means to you and I also know that this is about more than just jewelry, it's about you and me and the fact that we're best buds.
They're not gonna swallow anything, you guys are being way over protective. When I was a kid, my mom used to just throw me into a pile of broken glass!
Well, you're gonna have to leave sometime, because you both have jobs, and as soon as you do, we're switching it back! There's nothing you can do to stop us! Right, Joe?
All right! That's fine! That's fine! I won't bring over the chairs! I won't bring anything over! I wouldn't want to ruin the ambiance over here at Grandma's place!!
Oh I used too, but then Joey thought it would be fun to go to Central Park and hit rocks at...bigger rocks. Hey Rach, do you have a tennis racquet?
Oh, uh, that would be mine. See, I wrote a note to myself, and then I realised I didn't need it, so I balled it up and... ...now I wish I was dead.
And people say you don't pay attention. No, this is a much better job. It's vice-president of a company that does data reconfiguration and statistical factoring for other companies.
Look, forget it. We tried, but Phase Three is a lost cause, Okay? Those strippers were insanely hot, and I couldn't picture myself with any of them.
I'm telling you, she gives the worst massages ever!! Okay, it was like she was torturing me for information. And I wanted to give it up I just-I didn't know what it was!
Oh, nononowaitwaitwaitnono! Uh... we may not know anything about radiators per se, but we do have a certain amount of expertise in the heating and cooling... mileu.
Oh. Y'know, that night meant a lot to me too, and it wasn't because I was in a bad place or anything, it just meant a lot to me 'cause, you're really hot! Is that okay?
And I don't wanna say this, I don't you guys to hate me, but uh, I don't think, I can be around that dog anymore. Okay, so either the dog goes, or I go. Oh my god!!
No-no-no, y'know what? I really shouldn't have said that you were embarrassing me, I mean that really wasn't cool. And if it makes you feel any better, I've had a really lousy day.
What do you think she's just gonna sit there quietly? You don't think she's gonna want to make a toast? You don't think she's gonna want to grab the microphone and sing Part-time Lover?!
No, 'Slim Pickings', it's a barbecue restaurant. They're looking for a cook. Actually 'cook' may be a bit of a stretch. They're looking for someone to shovel mesquite.
Oh, I figured you guys would all be mad at me. So I got you some gifts that I found on the side of the road. Who wants the teddy bear with one leg?
Well I've been playing it for like eight hours, it'll loosen up. Come on, check out the scores. Oh, and also look at the initials, they're dirty words.
You wanna talk about people's feelings? You should have heard how hurt professor Stern was yesterday when I told him I wouldn't be able to go with him to Key West!
Ooh. Uh, I don't know how to tell you this, but she's in Monica's bedroom, getting it on with Max, that scientist geek. Ooh, look at that, I did know how to tell you.
And I'm blah? Listen, the only thing more boring than watching modern dance is having to listen to you talk about it, "Oh Chandler, I just lost myself in the moment."
So, it's a typical day at work. I'm inputting my numbers, and big Al calls me into his office and tells me he wants to make me processing supervisor.
Well I would've been happy because I would've be able to spend the rest of my life with the woman that I love. Or, you would've seen a Chandler shaped hole in that door.
Nope, hymn 253, His Eyes Are On The Sparrow! When my parents got divorced is when I started using humour as a defence mechanism.
Well, I tried Billy Jean King, but... you know, you and Monica have the same "I'm gonna kill you" look...? I can usually make it go away by kissing her...
Oh, uh.. I want her to think I might be in a restaurant.. y'know? I might have some kind of life, like I haven't been sitting around here honing for the past few hours.
You'll see, you guys are all gonna go off and get married, and I'm gonna end up alone. Will you promise me something? When you're married, will you invite me over for holidays?
Hey. I just, I just wanted to come over to-to say that I'm sorry. Y'know? I know I acted like the biggest idiot in the world, and I can completely understand why you were so upset.
I'm not worried, I'm uh, I'm fascinated. Y'know it's like uh, Biology! Which is funny because in high school I uh, I-I failed Biology and tonight Biology failed me.
It's just that I'm sick of being a victim of this Dick Clark holiday. I say this year, no dates, we make a pact. Just the six of us- dinner.
Oh wow, I hope you don't take this the wrong way but, I know we had plans to meet up tonight and, ugh, I'm just kinda worried about what it might do to our friendship.
All right listen, I have to go to the bathroom, but if the place with the big fish comes up again. I'd like know whether that's several big fish or just one big fish.
Y'know what? I am going to take you out to dinner tonight. I found this place that makes the greatest mozzarella sticks and jalepino poppers. No? Really? They taste so good.
And, I want you to remember that I gave you twenty seven dollars. No strings attached. Now, if you can't remember that, I think we should write it down-let's write it down!
Whatever I decide to do, I'm gonna be starting a career from scratch. It's gonna be a while before I make a living at it. Maybe now is not the right time to be starting a family.
It's not that hard to learn. And as for people realizing you have no idea what you're doing, hey, you're an actor. Act like a processor, people will think you're a processor.
Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out.
Hello? Hello? Oh, hey Charlie. Did anybody else hear? ... What? Susan got it?? How? Oh man, I would have slept with him!! .. Alright, bye.
Well, I don't have to break up with her this time. We're not involved! I'm going to do a pre-emptive strike! I'm going to end it with her before it starts. My ass is like frozen!
Oh hey. I'd shake your hand but uh; I'm really into the game. Plus, I think it'd be better for my ego if we didn't stand right next to each other.
All right! Fine! But it's just a lunch date, no more than an hour! And from now on I get my own dates, I don't want you setting me up with anybody ever again!
Look, don't you see what's happening here. Instead of hitting on her right away, he's becoming her confidant. Now he's gonna be the guy she goes too to complain about you.
Well, it's just the reason that I'm asking is because I kind of eh, uh, I was unable to-I mean I really wanted too, but I couldn't.... There huh-hmm, there-there was an incident.
Oh, yeah. But you have to give it back if I get a job. Of course, by that time in the future ties will be obsolete and we'll all be wearing silver jump suits.
Yes, but this is Pete. Okay? He's not like other people, on your first date he took you to Rome. For most guys that's like a third or fourth date kinda thing.
No, see, I'm trying this new screening thing. You know, I figure if I'm always answering the phone, people'll think I don't have a life. My god, Rodrigo never gets pinned.
Well, why don't you send her a musical bug, op, no you already did that. All right look, you're going to have to go there yourself now, okay, make a few surprise visits.
Oh no no no no, I'd love to be somebody's assistant! Answering phones, getting coffee, I live for that stuff! And I'm not too mature... farts, boobies, butt cracks!
All right, check it out. Check this out. It says here that there's a place you can go to rent videos of all the museums! "It's almost as good as being there."
Nothin! This is the nine millionth ring store we've been too and I can't find the perfect ring! Ugly ring! Ugly ring! Ugly ring! It's a beautiful selection.
Yes, but I feel like I've really gotten in touch with my feminine side enough today. You know. In fact I think we're two sachets away from becoming a lesbian couple.
Big picture please! So I was in the gift shop, and that's when I uh, saw this. New York.) Yeah, y'know what? I thought anything that can fit into this, can't be scary.
Well, last time I saw him he was heading out the door with the bride's maid and a bucket of strawberries. So uh, you're not still upset about what that guy told ya are ya?
You're damn right I'm right. I say you show this guy what you're made of. I say you stand your ground. I say you show him that you are the baddest hombre west of the lingerie.
"Jeremiah was a bullfrog. Was a good friend of mine, never understood a single word he said, but I helped himdrink his wine." So you just touch yourself for anything?
I was asleep. Oh no! No-no honey! Y'know what's sexy? Layers. Layers are sexy. And blankets are sexy. And oh! Hot water bottles are sexy.
Little baby girl Chandler, where I have heard that before? Oh right, Coach Ruben. Do you know what Pheebs? When you're done over there, we kinda have a situation over here too.
No. No, I won't. Do you know why I took all those lessons? See, for the first time I didn't want you to be embarrassed to be seen on the dance floor with some clumsy idiot.
Hey, y'know what we can do? Y'know, now that we are up? We can just like talk to each other all night long, y'know like we did when we were first going out. It'd be fun!
Okay, Ms. McKenna, she kind of works above my boss, she asked me to move to Tulsa and be the president of our office there, and I was sleeping and apparently, said yes.
Look, I want those basketball seats as much as you do! Okay, but we can't leave in the small apartment after we've lived here! Didn't you ever read Flowers for Algernon?
Oh Mon-Mon-Mon-Mon-look, this is the honeymoon suite. The room expects sex. The room would be disappointed if it didn't get sex. All of the other honeymoon suites would think it was a loser.
Y'know what, it doesn't matter, 'cause she picked me. Me! From now on I get the dates and you have to stay home on Saturday nights watching Ready, Set, Cook!
Hi! Listen, can we watch cartoons on your television? We need a porn break. We spent the last two hours watching In & Out & In, Again.
I'm right! Right? There was like no chemistry between them. Before they had heat, and now there's no heat! Now you know what this means, Joey told us what this means!
You know what's weird. Donald Duck never wore pants. But whenever he's getting out of the shower, he always put a towel around his waist. I mean, what is that about?
All right, think about it. Now remember when you were going out with that girl Donna and you guys broke up. Remember how horrible it was when you guys bumped into each other at the supermarket?
My specimen is in the room and I just want to thank whoever knocked on the door while I was in there. Really helped speed the process along! Janice! You're not... gone?
Yeah, I'm putting my foot down. Yeah look, when I proposed I told you that I would do anything to make you happy, and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy then, then that's what we're gonna do.
Y'know, I can't believe I'm getting my nails done! And you said it was gonna be fun! Which it kinda is. Also, you said there would be other guys here. There are no other guys here!
And we just sit here. I mean if I die the only way people would even know I was here, would be by the ass print on this chair! Look, we have to do something. Okay? Something huge!
Oh, you're right I, I should play in the hay. Forget about the fact that I just dropped 400 dollars to replace a bracelet that I hated to begin with. Bring on the hay.
Hey, no, I've never been lower or wetter. I'll be fine. I'll just turn your, uh, bedroom into a game room or somethin', you know, put the foosball table in there.
Heckles played clarinet in band, and I played clarinet. And he was in the scale modeler's club, and I was, well, there was no club, but I sure thought they were cool.
Wow! Listen, we had a good run. What was it? Four? Five months? I mean, that's more than most people have in a lifetime! So, good-bye, take care, bye-bye then!
Yeah, I'm putting my foot down. Yeah look, when I proposed I told you that I would do anything to make you happy, and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy, then, then that's what we're gonna do.
And, ah, you know, your fooling around with her. And you get all these like, mental images in your brain, you know, like Elle MacPherson, or that girl at the Xerox place....
Okay, it's just weird! Okay? I don't want to be standing their saying my vows and then having the mental image of you and Monica! I-I-I need...I don't know what I need. I need a walk.
Do you think that there's a town in Missouri or some place called Sample? And ah, as you're driving into town there's-there's like a sign, and it says "You're in Sample."
Well maybe you're going about this the wrong way. You know I mean think about it. Single white male, divorced three times,two illegitimate children. The personal ad writes itself....
Hey, y'know what, if you're gonna do that, if you're gonna name him Joey, you should name him Chandler. Oh, come on! Chandler's funny, sophisticated, and he's very loveable, once you get to know him.
No-no-no-no-no-no-no!! I can't get myself right out of them! You must have me confused with the Amazing Chandler!! Come on, you have to unlock me, she could be gone for hours, and I'm cold, and
Uh then there was that dialect coach who helped you with that play where you needed a southern accent. Which after twenty hours of lessons still came out Jamaican.
No, no, I keep trying, y'know? I can get out, "Joey, I have too..." but then I lose my nerve and I always finish with, "...go to the bathroom." He may think I'm sick.
Look you have to realize I don't think of you as a thin, beautiful woman. See this is one of things that I can apologize for later! Look, what I mean is you're Monica! Okay? And I am in love with Monica.
Yes, here it comes! I'm stuck here all day, and then you come in and spend two seconds with us and then expect to go off gallivanting with your friends? Well I don't think so mister!
Well! We er..climbed up four flights of stairs, manueveored a narrow hallway, dodged a rabid pitbul... but these last three feet are where it gets really tricky.
Oh, then no thanks. What the hell was that? Mental note: If Jill Goodacre offers you gum, you take it. If she offers you mangled animal carcass, you take it.
I've met the perfect woman. OK, we're sitting on her couch, we're fooling around, and then suddenly she turns to me and says, 'Do you ever want to do it in an elevator?'
I always thought having a heart attack was nature's way of telling you to die! But you're not gonna die. I mean, you are going to die, but you're not gonna die today. I wish I was dead.
Allright, I'm gonna watch it... I mean look, it's probably not even what I think it is... And even if it is... It can't possibly be as bad as what I'm picturing in my head... Can it?
No, no I just ah, didn't do them. Instead, I ah, hung out with a couple of friends and had a couple of beers so I certainly don't deserve any praise, verbal or otherwise.
Look you don't understand, Gandolf is amazing. Y'know you're never know what's gonna end up happening, you go out for a couple of beers and end up on a fishing boat to Nova Scotia!
Sure! Just give me a second to get all huffy and weird like you! Do you believe that who everdid something over here last night did what they did or didn't do ...I mean come on!!
Hello? Oh hi, Doctor Connelly. No, she's not here but, you know, I can tell her. Should I be sitting down for this? Oh. Well, so what does that mean? Ok. Ok, thank you. Thanks.
See, now, why would you assume that? Just because we're married? I will have you know that we are very hip, happening people. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to get back to reading the obituaries.
I say, Drew! Are you seeing anybody right now? Og-ee-op, I'm not asking for me, I'm... I mean... No, I'm-I'm not gay, I'm not asking you out. I'm not-I'm not-I'm not gay!
Little?! You freaked out big time! Okay? And I fixed it! We have switched places! I am the relationship and king and you are the crazy, irrational screw up! And now we're back.
But I am willing to offer her all those things. This was just a plan, y'know? A way to throw her off course so that when I offered her all these things, she'd be surprised!
You know, it's funny when my parents got divorced, they sent me to this shrink, and she told me that all kids have a tendency to blame themselves. But in your case it's actually kinda true.
Monica, will you stop? This is nuts. Do you know how long it's gonna be before you actually have to deal with this problem? I mean, you don't even have a boyfriend yet. Joey, she does not look fat.
Oh no-no-no, I will do it. Honey, you have to learn to sit down and relax and let your husband take care of things once and awhile. It's locked, you have to help me. Why is it locked?
Yes, yes she is. Didnt I memo you on this? See, after I let her go, err, I got a call from her psychiatrist, Dr. Flanen-nen, Dr. Flanen, Dr. Flan.
So tell me, how do- how do you think your husband would feel about you sitting here with me?...Sliding your foot so far up my pant leg you can count the change in my pocket?
Which I bought for ya. Taught ya how to use it. You thought it was a copier. Look, if there was anything I could do, I would do it. Okay? But everybody's allowed one mistake, right?
Y'know, maybe this isn't such a big deal. Y'know, I mean, the way that I see it is you get a great job and you get to have sex. Y'know, I mean, throw in a tree and a fat guy and you've got Christmas.
All right, you will notice that I am fully dressed. I, in turn, have noticed that you are not. So in the words of A. A. Milne, "Get out of my chair, dillhole!"
Hey, we're having some fun now, huh, Ross? Wanna do another one, huh Russ? OK... eleven letters, atomic element number 101... ends in ium.
Joey if you wanna punch me, go ahead, I deserve it. But I just want you to know that I would never soberly hurt you or your family, you're my best friend. I would never do anything like this ever again.
Hey, don't worry. I figure it'll be 2 hours to Phoebe's dad's house, they'll meet, they'll chat, they'll swap life stories, we'll still have plenty of time.
Hey, look, you're in trouble either way! Okay? If she comes back and sees me locked to this instead of the chair, she's gonna know you were in here. So you might as well just let me go.
Oh-ho-ho-ho-no! No! No switching! No sharing, and don't come crying to me! Ha-ha-ha! I may just sit here and have my cake all day! Just sit here in the hallway and eat my...
Ok, you know how most kids get their allowance from mowing the lawn or taking out the garbage, well I earned mineby plucking the eyebrows of my father and his "business" partners.
Oh please, you are obsessed with babies and-and marriage and everything that's related to babies and-and marriage! I've got an idea, why don't we turn down the heat on this pressure cooker?!
Our trains are on the same track, ok? Yeah, sure, I'm coming up 30 years behind him, but the stops are all the same. Bitter Town. Aloneville. Hermit Junction.
We just finished this magnificent Thanksgiving dinner. I have--and I remember this part vividly--a mouthful of pumpkin pie, and this is the moment my parents choose to tell me they're getting divorced.
Allright, fine, but don't blame me if it doesn't work. Because you know as well as I do that once Joey sets his mind on something, more often than not, he's going to have sex with it.
Woah, woah, woah. I don't need a roommate either, OK? I can afford to live here by myself. Ya know, I may have to bring in somebody once a week to lick the silverware.
Okay now it doesn't matter which one you choose, y'know? It's completely up to you. Our guy is perfect, or you can go out with the guy Phoebe deemed not good enough to go out with herself.
So Steve said he had to go to the doctor. And Steve's doctor's name is Doctor Muppy. So I said, 'Doctor Monkey?' And that is how the whole Doctor Monkey thing came up.
Yes, yes I actually saw him leave. I mean that guy is standing in the window holding a human head. He is STANDING IN THE WINDOW HOLDING A HUMAN HEAD!
Because we don't do that. We are Bings! And if there's one thing my father taught me was... well to always knock before going into the pool house... but the other thing was never borrow money.
Maybe we finish this for him! "Also I cloned a dinosaur in my lab. She's now my girlfriend. I don't care what society says. It's the best sex I've ever had"... aaand SEND!
Oh that's so cool! Why would a cop come in here though? They don't serve donuts. Y'know what actually, could you discover the badge again? I think I can come up with something better than that.
Well, Chandler will be there for you too. I mean, well, he might be a little late, but-but, he'll be there. And he'll bring you some cold soda, if want you need him for is that you're really hot.
Let me get this straight. I called yesterday trying to cancel my reservation and I was told it was not refundable, then we drove six hours all the way up here and now you tell me that we don't have a reservation?
Nine times! Okay, I had to put on lotion! But, it's gonna be okay, because as of tomorrow I'm conducting an experiment, and if all goes as planned, my butt will be smack free.
Alright. "It was summer, and it was hot. Rachel was there. A lonely gray couch. 'Oh, look,' cried Ned, and then the kingdom was his forever. The end."
Oh, because his penis was too big. Oh, I'm sorry, that's the kind of thing I do. They broke up because Mike didn't want to get married. Hey, what if you just let Phoebe know you'd be open to marriage?
Yeah, I know, I-I wish I had too, but y'know I-I think this is a good thing. Y'know? 'Cause we've had our first fight, and now we can move on. Y'know, I know for me- Nick's pants?
Okay, hear me out. Okay? You give the best bad massages. If anybody was looking for the best bad massage and they were thinking to themselves, "Who's the best of that?" They'd have to go to you.
No, it's a book that's just a book, okay? It's an early edition of the Velveteen Rabbit. It was her favorite book as a kid. So, uh, just... let me know if she likes it, okay?
You know he coulda gotten me a VCR, he coulda gotten me a set of golf clubs, but no, he has to get me the woman repeller! The eyesore from the Liberace house of crap!
No! That was a test! In a couple of hours I'm gonna get really drunk and wanna call Kathy and you guys are gonna have to stop me! And then after that, I'm gonna get so drunk, I'm gonna wanna call Janice
Oh come on! Hello! Hi! My name is Chandler, here's my friend Ross right here, and we were wondering you know if you're up for it. We only need six more people for a human pyramid...Swoop!! Swoop!!
Phoebe and Rachel! So the people that knew about our wedding before me were you, Phoebe and Rachel, Heldi, and apparently some band called Starlight Magic 7 who are available by the way!
I don't know. I can't--I just, I can't get her out of my head. Y'know? I mean, I'm a very bad person. I'm a very, very bad person. I'm a horrible person. No you're not Chandler! We still love you Chandler!
No, no I only dated two girls in college, both blonde, both not attractive... Hold on one second; let me check this out. (He gets up and grabs a photo album.
Hi, my name's Chandler. I just moved in next door and I was wondering if you would be interested in battling me in a post-apoplectic world for control of the galaxies last remaining energy source?
All right, check out this bad boy. 12 megabytes of ram. 500 megabyte hard drive. Built-in spreadsheet capabilities and a modem that transmits at over 28,000 b.p.s.
Oh yeah! I mean at first I hated it, but why wouldn't I, because as a man I've been trained not to listen! But after chapter 16: "fat, single and ready to mingle", I was uplifted.
I am telling you, years from now, schoolchildren will study it as one of the greatest first dates of all time. It was unbelievable! We could totally be ourselves, we didn't have to play any games...
Let me see what you wrote about yourself: "Doctor Paleontology, two kids... " You split with Carol because you have different interests?... I think you split with Carol because you've one very similar interest!
I don't care, this is our apartment! And they stole-you stole it-our apartment, and we won that apartment fair and square, twice! And I am getting it back right now. I'm getting back right now!
Oh, I know. This must be so hard. Oh, no. Two women love me. They're both gorgeous and sexy. My wallet's too small for my fifties, and my diamond shoes are too tight.
What do you want from me, I've never met the guy. So anyway, Rachel, I'm sorry you can't stay, but the rest of us have a lot of work to do. What are you doing? All right, listen, I've got to wake up!
Alright, that's it. Look Joey, I'm sorry, I realize this is the role of a lifetime for ya, and if I could just fire Joseph, I would, but unfortunately that's not possible so I'm gonna have to let both of you go.
Y'know what, I know what will cheer you guys up! I had a little talk with the boys in New York, told 'em about all the hard work you've been doing and that a little Christmas bonus may be in order.
Oh, just hanging out, talkin' about uh, websites. Yeah, we saw this really interesting website about marriage and how totally unnecessary it is and how its just a way for the government to keep tabs on you.
To her face? Look it's the end of the date, I'm standing there, I know all she's waiting for is for me to say 'I'll call her' and it's just y'know, comes out. I can't help it, it's a compulsion.
Oh just great. He beeps me now with codes. One is, "Bring me food." Two is, "I'm with a girl, bring us food." Three is, "I'm lost and I can't find food."
Monica is a self-sufficient, together lady. Being with her has been like being on a vacation. And what may be perceived as high maintenance is merely attention to detail and--generosity of spirit.
I'm telling you this thing won't print. Yes, I pressed that button like 100 times. You know, for a hot line you are not so hot. What? What is that in the background? Are you watching Star Trek?
So.. let me get this straight. So my two friends die, I get Emma. Then my wife dies, then Emma the one tiny ray of hope left in my life gets taken away from me?
Yeah I gotta say thank you, I was really nervous. Y'know I've been told I come on to strong, make to many jokes, and then it was really hard to sidestep that duty thing. Duties. Duties! Poo.
Actuary... no. Book-keeper... no. Topless dancer... Hey, d'you know what I just realized? You are the sole wage earner. *You* are the head of the household. I don't do anything - I'm a kept man!
Oh, no, no. Nina... ..she is whooo wewee-woo whoo whoo! In fact, if you asked her right now, she would have no recollection of being fired at all, none at all.
I can blow dry it. I can put gel on it. It doesn't matter, I still wind up with this little cowlicky thing on the middle part of my head. It's so annoying. Does it bug you?
Oh, yeah. Uh, no you can't have my jacket! Because then I would be cold! If you thought that you were going to be cold, you should've brought your own jacket. But uh, other than that, are you okay? Are you okay?
You know, it haunts me? Up 'til now, the worst thing I ever saw, was my father doing tequila shots off the naked houseboy. After this, I would gladly make that my screensaver!
Well yes yes... You look nice can mean that your face looks nice. I want to compliment your body. I mean..I wouldn't change it. At all. And more specifically, I wouldn't want anything to get any bigger.
I am, I actually am. I mean this is amazing. My entire life I have feared this place, and now that I'm here it's like what was the big deal. I could probably say 'Let's move in together.' and I'd be okay.
Look, Joey, Kathy is clearly not fulfilling your emotional needs. But Casey, I mean granted I only saw the back of her head, but I got this sense that she's-she's smart, and funny, and gets you.
Hey I didn't kill your fish. Look Eddie... Would you look at what I'm doin' here. That can't be smart. So we're just gonna take this guy right off ya and put him here in Mr. Pocket. Tangellon?
Look, I figured I would try to convince him not to tell the story anymore, and I figure the best way to do that is face to face-And by face I don't mean his lap. And by face, I don't mean my ass.
I don't know, Richard's really nice and everything, uh, it's just that we don't know him really well, ya know, and plus he's, ya know, old -er than some people, but, uh, younger than some buildings.
See Joe, not that that's not grrreat! But, one of the cool things about having somebody we know perform the ceremony is that it can be about us! Y'know, it can be more personal. You can tell stories about us!
Pheebs, can you help me pick out an engagement ring for Monica? I can't figure this out! It's so hard! Should I get her a Tiffany cut or a Princess cut or a-ah-ah! Paper cut!
Oh no, yes we do my man. Remember when we were back in college and we went to that spring dance and you walked right up to that girl you liked and you could not stop talking about the Irish potato famine?
Two. This photographer, who seemed really dull. And this actor guy, who I'm not sure about, because when he called and I answered the phone 'Chandler Bing,' he said 'Whoa-whoa, short message.'
Well, don't believe everything you hear, Ken. But yeah, that's true. Alright, let's get started, by take a look at last quarter's figures. Ah, Claudia, aren't you supposed to blow smoke up the bosses' ass?
What if I had had the guts to quit my job? I'd probably be writing for the New Yorker, getting paid to be funny. But my job's fun too! I mean tomorrow, I-I don't have to wear a tie.
He said...he said, he said that they're having a great time. I'm sorry. But, the silver lining, if you wanna see it, is that he made the decision all by himself! Without any outside help whatsoever.
Oh my God this doesn't count! Okay? The interview was over, that was the real Chandler Bing in there, this is just some crazy guy out in the hall! Call security! There's a crazy guy out in the hall!
I am here, on my knees, holding up these couch cushions as a symbol of my sorrow and regret, much like they did in biblical times. Though you may haveth anger now. . .
Oh, that's ok.I'll just try and reschedule. "Hi, this is Chandler Bing. I made a reservation there and I need to change it Oh, what do you mean it's not refundable? Can I just come some other time? Oh, can't you make an exception?"
Yeah, I know, but all of those little annoying things she did before we fell in love? Like her voice, her laugh, her personality-Well, they're all back! Y'know? And she's picked up like nine new ones!
No-no-no-no, no, it's a good thing. Why must we dial so speedily anyway? Why must we rush through life? Why can't we savor the precious moments? Those are some huge breasts you have.
All right ladies, here's what we're gonna do. You are gonna take off my clothes. You two, go get the oils. And you just constantly scream at the top of your voice, "Chandler's the king! Chandler's the king!"
Yeah, Ross can't go so it's between my friend Eric Prower who has breath issues and Dan with the poking. 'Did you see that play? Do you want some more beer? Is that Spike Lee?'
I am trying to open your eyes, my man! Don't you see, if you lived with Phoebe she's always gonna be there. You're gonna get home, she's there. You go to bed, she's there. You wake up and oh yes, she's there!
Can I just say how much I appreciate you coming with me. When we get to Tulsa I'm taking you for a great dinner at 'Slim Pickings'. 'So Cheesy'? 'Whole Hog'? It's going to be tough to keep Kosher in Tulsa.
Okay, okay-okay, ah, Chloe works with that guy Issac. Issac's sister is Jasmine. And Jasmine works at that message place with Phoebe. And Phoebe's friends with Rachel. And that's the trail, I did it!
The meaning of the box is three fold. One , it gives me the time to think about what I did. Two , it proves how much I care about my friendship with Joey. And three , it hurts!
All right, wait! Come on! Just wait one second! There has to be something that I can do! Something! If we still had that entertainment unit I would get in it for six hours and think about how I let you down. What?
Oh, so that's why the priest threw holy water on me. Okay, listen, you have to cheer up! Okay? You should come out with Ross and me, I mean anything is better than sitting around here crying all day about Kate.
She's moving on! Okay, if it's not this guy, it's gonna be somebody else! And unless you're thinking about subletting my peep hole, you are going to have to get used to the fact that the relationship is over! Okay, man? It's over.
I don't know, my mother spent most of her money on her fourth wedding. She's saving the rest for her divorce. And any extra cash my father has he saves for his yearly trips to Dollywood.
Yeah, he's made phone calls, written letters, he even came to New York, but I always said I was too busy to see him. Y'know it's all very Cats in the Cradle-I don't want to get into it. Here we go.
You had a dream about a girl that I am seeing?! Oh, that is so cool! I can't tell you how many times I've dreamt about a girl that he was seeing. Anyway we're talking about your dream. I love you. Your dream?
Okay, Pheebs, we decided the picnic idea was a little... Y'know, it didn't have any... It-it, well it blew. So, we thought, that this afternoon that we would all go away for the whole weekend to, Atlantic City!
I am mad! But you know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna forgive you! Because that's what friends do! They forgive their friends when they do everything you just said, all on the list there. Well, but I want you to remember that I forgave you.
Eight and a half hours of aptitude tests, intelligence tests, personality tests... and what do I learn? "You are ideally suited for a career in data processing for a large multinational corporation."
If you wanna give Joey a Christmas present that disrupts the entire building, why not get him something a little bit more subtle, like a wrecking ball, or a vile of small pox to release in the hallway?
Okay, here's the situation. The keys to the cuffs are on the back of the door. Could you be a doll and grab them and scoot on over and unlock me? And on a totally different subject, that is a lovely pantsuit.
What? Oh this is excellent. You know he coulda gotten me a VCR, he coulda gotten me a set of golf clubs, but no, he has to get me the woman repeller, the eyesore from the Liberace house of crap.
Well, y'know, I had some trouble with it at first too, but the way I look at it is, I get all the good stuff: all the fun, all the talking, all the sex; and none of the responsibility. I mean, this is every guy's fantasy!
I drew my own bath, but I did it wrong! The water's tepid. The salt didn't dissolve and is now... lodged places. And the scents I used don't compliment each other. Eucalyptus and chamomile-Oh!
Nothing for you, you have Paolo. You don't have to face the horrible pressures of this holiday: desperate scramble to find anything with lips just so you can have someone to kiss when the ball drops!! Man, I'm talking loud!
Yes, Fran. I know what time it is, but I'm looking at the WENUS and I'm not happy!... Oh, really, really, really? Well, let me tell you something... you will care about it, because I care about it! You got it? Good! Whooooaaaa....
I pity the fool who puts on my jewelry, I do, I do. I pity the fool that. . . Hi. Hey man, we were just doin' some uhh, impressions over here. Do your Marcel Marceau. That's actually good.
An invitation for the At First Sight premiere? Oh my God! Val Kilmer didn't wear this in Batman! He wore it to the premiere of some tooty-fruity love story where he played a blind guy!
Okay, I've already taught you so much already, but whatever. See when you flirt with a guy you think, "I'm just flirting, no big deal." But the guy is thinking, "Finally! Somebody who wants to sleep with me!"
Sorry, I just...can't sleep. Ooh! Where is that book that you are reading with the two women who were ice-skating and wearing, wearing those hats with the flowers on it? Because every time I look at that cover I'm like...
You know who else picked Rachel? Ross, and you know what else Ross did? He stole my joke. You know what? I'm going to get a joke journal. Y'know? And document the date and time of every single one of my jokes.
Someone's left a glass on the coffee table. There's no coaster. It's a cold drink, it's a hot day. Little beads of condensation are inching their way closer and closer to the surface of the wood...
Okay, so we've established my name, and hit me. But theoretically y'know, I mean say we weren't friends, say it's a blind date. I show up at your door, and I'm like "Hey, nice to meet, ya. Hey, oh-hey."
Look, you have to help me! Okay? I mean, I know what to do with a woman, y'know, I know where everything goes, it's always nice. But I need to know what makes it go from nice to, "My God! Somebody's killing her in there!"
Daddy. All right look, here's the story. Well, we had just finished playing racquetball and we were gonna take a steam. I walk into the steam room and it was really steamy. So I take off my glasses and that's when in happened.
Yes, but I just had one. Two. Two tiny cigarettes. Okay, five. A pack. Two pack...a...a carton. Three big fat cartons in two days. But it's over, I made a decision, I'm not gonna smoke anymore.
She's right, it's Jill. Jill Goodacre. Oh my God. I am trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre! Is it a vestibule? Maybe it's an atrium. Oh, yeah, that is the part to focus on, you idiot!
Y'know what? You should go to my guy, because when I went in there with my third nipple. He just lopped it right off. Y'know? So I guess I'm lucky. I mean not as lucky as people who were born with two nipples.
You know what, okay, fine. Don't get up, you just sit right there. I just hope, you don't mind, you know, my hand right here. Op, not touching, can't get mad! Not touching can't get mad! Not touching can't get mad!
Y'know what? We're not sad, we're not sad, we're just not 21 anymore. Y'know? I'm 29 years old, damnit! And I want to sit in a comfortable chair, and watch television and go to bed at a reasonable hour!
Ho-oh, he's gonna get some! Of the glare from the streetlight out of his apartment. Y'know so umm, he's closed the drapes there so he can have a nice, pleasant conversation with your little sister. Well, I'm off to bed!
All right! Okay! I think I am making some progress with Joey, when I went into the apartment he went straight into his bedroom but he only slammed the door once! I mean yeah, he gave me the finger while doing it.
I mean, I can write slogans. I mean, how hard can it be, right? "Cheese. It's milk that you chew." "Crackers. Because your cheese needs a buddy." "A grape. Because who can get a water melon in your mouth?"
Because, I-I should've called! Y'know if I had just called her after our big, stupid fight, she never would've gone out with Nick, and they would've ended up in bed together. I threw her at his man nipples!
Honey, it is not a date! I haven't talked to her in ten years! You can't just call up somebody you haven't talked to in ten years and ask them for a favor. There are rules, y'know? You gotta, you got to put in some time.
Hey man, look it's my best bud. How ya doin? Wow, you are really gettin' good at that Marcel Marceau thing. Hey, whaddya say uh, we play some ball, you and me, huh, whaddya say? OK, that's my bad.
All right everybody, I know that it's Christmas Eve and you'd rather be with your families, but there's *no* call for writing "Screw you, Mr. Bing!" on the back of my chair! -- By the way, you can all call me Chandler.
And then you click it and, uh-oh, she's naked. And then, and then you click it again and she's dressed. She's a business woman, she's walking down the street, she's window shopping, and whoa-whoa-whoa, sh-she's naked!
Umm, you know how we always said that it would be fun to move to Paris for a year? You know, you could study French cooking and I could write and we could take a picnic along the Seine and go wine tasting in Bordeaux?
No. You decided to go into the out-of-work actor business. Now that wasn't easy, but you did it! And I'd like to believe that when the right woman comes along, you will have the courage and the guts to say "No thanks, I'm married."
Oklahoma where the wind comes sweeping down the plane, STOP IT! Why couldn't they have sent me to Texas? 7 o clock maybe I'll hit the gym who am I kidding pay-per-view porn. -Cuts to Monica.
Well, I like that idea. Obviously! I was thinking maybe-maybe-maybe it could be a game room, y'know? I mean you can buy old arcade games like uh, like Space Invaders and Asteroids for $200, the real ones! The big-big ones!
Du-du-I wrote it, I wrote it on the board! I wrote it on the board, then I went all over New York City looking for ya! I went to Ross's! I went to the coffeehouse! I went to any place that they made sandwiches!
All right fine, don't do anything, just sit here and talk to us, meanwhile she is talking to him about you. And he's being Mr. Joe Sensitive, and she starts thinking 'Maybe this is the guy for me, because he understands me.'
Hear me out woman. I'll go down the fire escape. Then, I'll wait for a while. Then, when I come up the stairs, it'll be just like I just got back from Tulsa. Then, Joey and I will come in and see that there's no guy in here.
Because that's who I am, okay? I'm sure a mature man like Richard could see a tape like that and it wouldn't bother him. Just'd be another saucy anecdote for him to share at his men's club over brandy and moustaches.
Phoebe thinks you and Don are soul mates, and I don't believe in that kind of stuff. But then you two totally get along. So look, I won't stand in your way if you want to run off with Don and live in a house of cheese.
Actually, we're trying, and I don't think Monica's gonna wanna postpone it. We're supposed to have sex tonight. Actually, she's probably at home naked right now. I tend to keep talking until somebody stops me. I can just picture her on the bed right now.
Guys! Guys! Come on! It's Thanksgiving, it's not important who wins or loses. The important thing is, the Dutch girl picked me! Me! Not you! Holland loves Chandler! Thank you, Amsterdam! Good night!!
The problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter how great the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y'know? I mean, we're in the car, we're fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake.
Oh No, It's Terrific, It'S- It'S- Y'Know, You Deserve This, After All Your Years Of Struggling, You'Ve Finally Been Able To Crack Your Way Into Show Business.
I'll take it! All right look, I gotta know. Are you finished with me? Are you finished with him? Do you still love him? Do you still love me? All right look, I'm gonna need an actual answer here okay, so which is it, him or me?
No, I know, but it's just so hard, you know? I mean, you're sitting there with her, she has no idea what's happening, and then you finally get up the courage to do it, and there's the horrible awkward moment when you've handed her the note.
I don't wanna know what Monica got me. Y'know? I mean, look, I'm sure she worked really hard at getting you a present, and wanting to surprise me, and you guys are gonna ruin that, and I, look we have to put these back, this is not what Christmas is about.
Oh, it's not just that, I would be England's most powerful weapon. Jet setting heartbreaker on her majesty's secret service. A man who fears no one; with a license to kill. Would Monica let me wear this?
Yeah! I've never been in a relationship that's lasted this long before. Y'know to get past the beginning and still be around each other all the time, I think that's pretty incredible. And the fact that this is happening all with you, yeah I think that's pretty exciting.
Hey, you know what you can do? I remember reading about this director, I think it was Orson Wells, who at the beginning of the movie would hire somebody, just so he could fire them in front of everybody. Then they would all know, who's boss.
Are you serious?! I mean like eloping?! No more stupid wedding stuff?! No more these flowers or these flowers or these flowers-Think of the money we'll save!! We're not eloping. I love the flowers. Can our wedding be bigger please?
Monica, you have got to stop this competitive thing! Okay? It's crazy. {Finally! The voice of reason.} I mean, just impress Gary and Phoebe we have to go upstairs and have sex over and over and I'm saying no to this, why? Get your coat.
Our balcony? Seriously? That's so funny because I told Monica we should put lights on our balcony. And she said"No, no. It's too cold, nobody will go out there." And I said "Maybe if we put some light out there they will"
All right, I have to get that, but no-no. Hello? Hi! Yeah listen, I'm, I'm in need of a stripper and I was told that you do that. Let me ask you this, what, what do you do for the extra hundred? So would I, would I have to provide the grapes?
Yeah, not bad right? You know what, Monica's gonna be working late, so I'm gonna make this place spotless. You know what else I'm gonna do, know what else I'm gonna do? I'm gonna go downstairs, I'm gonna get her some flowers. Now who wouldn't wanna live with me?
Oh, no, no, no, don't go! I've scared ya'! I've said too much! I'm hopeless, and awkward, and desperate for love!! Hey, Janice! It's me. Um, yeah, I-I-I just wanna apologize in advance for having chased you down the street.
No! That would be so awkward! Look-Besides, we work in different departments. He's on the sixth floor y'know? So he calls me Toby once in a while. What's the big deal? It could be worse, it's not like he's calling me Muriel.
No-no-no, if you unplug it, I'll have nothing to show for my day! It would be like I was at work. No! Hey look at that! Look at that, it's still there! This thing must have some kind of primitive ROM Chip in it or something!
Okay, so if an eight comes up, we take it as a sign and we do it! {Whoa! Where have I heard that before? Matthew Perry talking about signs in Las Vegas. I guess it must've been some movie I saw.} What do you say?
She said yes!! She said yes!! Awful play, man. Whoah. Her name's Aurora, and she's Italian, and she pronounces my name 'Chand-lrr'. 'Chand-lrr'. I think I like it better that way. Oh, listen, the usher gave me this to give to you.
No, no, the actual cartoon character. Of course the balloon. It's all over the news. Right before he reached Macy's, he broke free and was spotted flying over Washington Square Park. I'm goin' to the roof, who's with me?
Y'know, I can't believe Kathy did this too me. I really, thought that she was the one. I tell you what, from now on I'm never getting out of this chair, ever! Okay? From now on, this chair is the one! You wanna what else is the one? My sweat pants!
I Think It's Great That You Work Here. You'Re Going To Make A Lot Of Money, And Here's Your First Tip. Don't eat yellow snow. . Ah ha ha, 2:15, coffeehouse.
What are you talking about? The couch is perfectly in line with the carpet. And then I can just walk over here and casually just put my feet right up on the... OK, OK, here's what we do, we just uh, move the couch closer to the coffee table.
Ok, all right, look. Let's get logical about this, ok? We'll make a list. Rachel and Julie, pros and cons. Oh. We'll put their names in bold, with different fonts, and I can use different colors for each column.
Nobody is opening anything ok? Look, I don't know about you guys, but I wanna see the look on Monica's face when I give her my present, and I'm sure she wants to see the look on my face when I get mine. So please, please, can we just, can we put them back?
Hey, I didn't make up the rules. Now, after you receive the doubling bonus, you get uh, one card. Now that one card could be worth $100 bringing your total to 1,500. Don't get to excited because that's not gonna happen unless you get-No way!
David, let me stop you there 'cause I think I see where this is going. I'm not very good at giving advice. So if you want advice, go to Ross, Monica, or... Joey, if the thing you wanna advice about is pizza toppings or burning sensation when you pee.
Oh well it's not me, it's my character, Chandy. Yeah the rogue processor who seduces his co-worker's wives for sport and then laughs about it the next day at the water cooler. In fact, I have her panties right there in my drawer.
No-no-no! It is going to be okay, because Mrs. Braverman is gonna send away for a free one and that way we all win! The only losers are the big cheesecake conglomerate, Momma's Little Bakery. I feel terrible, I'm a horrible, horrible, horrible person.
Oh no no no.. I'll get her. I'm super-compentent and totally responsibile and fourth in line to raise Emma. I'll be right there Emma. Just let me get my trusty diaper bag here. Well.. what do you know? I guess, I'll be the one who dies first.
Hi! Hi. Okay, there was a slight mix-up at the jewelry store, the ring you're about to propose with was supposed to be held for me. So, I'm gonna need to have that back. But, in exchange I'm willing to trade you this beautiful, more expensive ring. Ew.
Well, I umm, I mean this is just off the top of my head now, umm but I have this friend. This actor friend and he would kill me if he thought I was doing this umm, but umm would it be possible for him to get an audition for your movie say on Thursday?
Ok, ok, you can be shirts and I'll be skins. I'll be skins. Hey, how you holdin' up there, tiger? Oh, sorry, when my parents were getting divorced I got a lot of tigers. Got a lot of champs, chiefs, sports, I even got a governor.
Well, I don't know what mad him so mad, y'know? All I said was that uh, I didn't think this wasn't gonna be his big break, that this movie wasn't going to do anything for him, and that uh, y'know it didn't sound like a real movie--Okay, he should've pushed me off of the bridge.
Hey, look, this name has been holding me back my entire life. Okay, it's probably why kids picked on me in school, and why I never do well with women... So, as of 4 o'clock tomorrow, I'm either gonna be Mark Johnson or John Markson.
It is going to be perfect. I am taking her to her favorite restaurant. I'm going to get her a bottle of the champagne that she really loves; therefore knows how expensive it is. Then when the glasses are full, instead of proposing a toast I'm just gonna propose.
You know, guys I got to say. This means so much to me. That you would trust me with your child. I mean, we all know that Monica and I have been trying to have a baby of our own. You know I've had my doubts about my skills as a father, but that you two.. that you two....
Okay look, don't...don't be mad okay? But after I unpacked the boxes I wanted to do something nice for you, so, I-I-I cleaned the apartment. So I moved everything around and then I forgot where it, where it went back and I'm sorry, I'm very sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Really? He does? Hey, buddy, what's up! Oh, she told you about that, huh. Well, yeah, I have one now and then. Well, yeah, now. Well, it's not that big- ..well, that's true,.. Gee, y'know, no-one- no-one's ever put it like that before. Well, okay, thanks!
I'm sorry. You're not easy-going, but you're passionate, and that's good. And when you get upset about the little things, I think that I'm pretty good about making you feel better about that. And that's good too. So, they can say that you're high maintenance, but it's okay, because I like ... maintaining you.
Well, it's not your fault. What are you gonna do? Not take her to the hospital? Y'know? You're doing nothing wrong. Except for harboring an all consuming love for the woman whose carrying his baby. Richard? If-if you're in there, could you pass me my credit card?
No no no! Look, Carol, can I call you Carol? Wh-why would I when your name is Elaine? Oh what a great picture of your son, strapping! That's a picture of your daughter, isn't it, well she's lovely. I like a girl with a strong jaw. I'll call you from Tulsa.
I don't see it that way. Okay? Because, I see two Monicas, the one that was my friend, who lived across the hall, and wanted to have a lot of babies and then the new Monica, who I just started to date. Now, who's to say what she wants?! I'm right. I'm right. Am I right?
Come on, pick up, pick up! Hello? Transit Authority? Yes, hello. I'm doing research for a book, and I was wondering what someone might do if they left a baby on a city bus. Yes I do realize that would be a very stupid charact er.
You know, on second thought, gum would be perfection. 'Gum would be perfection'? 'Gum would be perfection.' Could have said 'gum would be nice,' or 'I'll have a stick,' but no, no, no, no. For me, gum is perfection. I loathe myself.
It was awful. To get out of going to dinner with Doug I told him that you and I split up. So then he took me to all these strip clubs and sleazy bars, and then when I wouldn't give him my wedding ring, he threw a soda can at a bird!
I just think that things would go a lot smoother if we each have our own zone. Phoebe, you can be in charge of wiping. And y'know Mon, you can be in charge of diapering and I can be in charge of looking how cute they are when they put their hands around...
She doesn't know. Says she loves us both. Y'know I woke up this morning and I was in love, well I was happy. Y'know it serves me right for buying that twelve pack of condoms. And now I can't even return them, because she choked on the reciept!
You don't think I've tried? You think I like having 50 dollars taken out of my bank account every month? No, they make you go all the way down there! Then they use all of these phrases and peppiness to try and confuse you! Then they bring out Maria.
Y'know what the worse part was? I got to see what my life would be like without you. It was like It's a Wonderful Life with lap dances. Please promise that you will never leave me, that we will grow old together, and be with each other for the rest of our lives.
Look, I just don't think Monica and I are ready to get married yet! Y'know? I mean, I love her and everything but seeing Ross and Rachel coming out of that chapel was like a, like a wake-up call that Monica and I are moving so fast. Y'know? And, how do I tell her without crushing her?
What are you, stop naming dwarves! Hello, Janice. Hi, I'm so glad that you called, I know I've been acting a really weird lately. And, it's just because I'm crazy about you, and I just got...stupid, and, and scared, and....stupid a couple of more times. I'm sorry. Really?! Really?!
Okay, so this isn't a picture of our first, but it is a picture of my first kiss with...with this lady. Which by the look on your face I'm sure you'll remember. So we don't need--There's no need to have this picture. How about I take the real pictures and get them developed right now.
Hi, listen, I'm sorry about before. I don't need to have a game room. I mean when I was a kid I only played those games because I couldn't get girls, and now I can 'em-Now, I have you. Not-not that I think that I have you or think of you as property in any sort of way, I see women...
We're not gonna have this conversation again... Look at this place. Why am I so intimidated by this guy? Pretentious art, this huge macho couch. When we know all he does is sit around all day crying about losing Monica to a real man! You don't think he's here, do you?
Okay, this is good, this is good. All right listen, I have one. Janice likes to cuddle, at night, which, you know I'm all for. But, uh, you know when you want to go to sleep, you want some space. So, uh, how do I tell her that without, you know, accidentally calling her fat or something.
So, Ross and I are going to Disneyland and we stop at this restaurant for tacos. And when I say restaurant, I mean a guy, a hibachi, and the trunk of his car. So Ross has about 10 tacos. And anyway, we're on Space Mountain and Ross starts to feel a little iffy.
Ya know I remember my father, all dressed up in the red suit, the big black boots, and the patent leather belt, sneakin around downstairs. He didn't want anybody to see him but he'd be drunk so he'd stumble, crash into something and wake everybody up.
Hey, just because this woman thinks she can actually see Joey through the magical box in her living room doesn't mean she's not a person. I mean, does she not deserve happiness, does she not deserve love? What're you lookin' at me for? He's the one who wants to boff the maniac.
It's not just their marriage! I mean, look at yours. Look at everybody's! The only person that can make marriage work is Paul Newman! And I've met me; I am not Paul Newman. I don't race cars! I don't make popcorn! None of my proceeds go to charity.
Uh, two larges, extra cheese on both. But listen, don't ring the buzzer for 19, ring 20, Geller-Green, they'll let you in, OK. If you buzz our door, there's no tip for you. OK, thanks. Pizza's on the way. I told you we wouldn't have to get up.
Well let's see, there was the guy with the ferrets, that's plural. The spitter. Oh-ho, and yes, the guy that enjoyed my name so much he felt the need to make a little noise every time he said it. Nice to meet you, Chandler Bing Bing! Great apartment Chandler Bing, Bing!
Oh God, it freaked me out. Okay, I know it shouldn't have, but it did. I mean I like her, I don't want to stop seeing her, but every so often it's like 'Hey, y'know what, where's your leg?' I mean I'm the smallest person in the world aren't I? I'm the smallest person in the world.
So I have a flaw! Big deal! Like Joey's constant knuckle-cracking isn't annoying? And Ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word? And Monica, with that snort when she laughs? I mean, what the hell is that thing? ...I accept all those flaws, why can't you accept me for this?
A-huh. So he's rolling down the street and he starts to lose control, you know... maybe he falls... maybe hurts himself. Just then, a kid comes flying by wearing the shoes. He jumps over the old guy and laughs, and the line reads: "Not suitable for adults!"
But only because I was up all night worried about this meeting, ain't that funny? Irony? Not a fan, alright . See, here's the thing. I went home and told my wife about Tulsa and she won't go. See, me, I love Tulsa! Tulsa is heaven! Tulsa is Italy-Please don't make me go there!
Alright look, let's think about this, ok, do you really think that people are gonna stir up your family at this tragic time? That people are gonna post condolences on a website? This is not about people not caring that you're dead .This is about people not having a decent outlet for their grief.
Alright! That is it. This is our apartment and you can not behave this way. Now if you can't act your age then you shouldn't be here at all. Now those plates may not be as nice as the pretty pink ones I picked out, but they're very important to Monica. I want you to apologize to her right now.
I'm saying that she... is a devil woman! Y'know I mean you think you know someone and then they turn around and they sleep with Nick! Nick, with his rock hard pecs, and his giant man-nipples! I hate him, I hate her! Well, I don't hate her, I love her. This is all my fault really.
Well uh, Archie needs money to fix his jalopy , uh but he doesn't want Reggie to just give him the money. So Reggie hires him as his assist-as his butler. And then makes him do all these crazy things like bring him milkshakes that can't have lumps in them.
Yeah! When you were talking about Roger, that was killing me! Look, things like last night they don't just happen. Y'know? Or at least not to me. Or with the other two women, in the morning y'know I was just lying there and I couldn't wait to just go hang out with my friends, but with you I always y'know with a friend.
And I'm sure we're all very excited that Ross and Emily are getting married at Montgomery Hall. I mean to think, my friend getting married in Monty Hall. Ohh, come on!! Monty Hall!! Lets make a Deal!! Come on, you people!! All right, forget it!! Congratulations, Ross and Emily.
Of course he has this big huge dog! That uh, barks into the night. Well, who doesn't love dogs? Ah, he's a tap dancer! Yes, some would say that is a lost art. He's a pimp! There you go! Yes, he's a pimp. He's a big, tap dancing pimp! Hello?
I know, And then all of the sudden your Mom pops into your head. And your like 'Mom, get outta here!' You know, but of course, like, after that you can't possibly think of anything else, and you can't, you know, stop what your doing. So it's kinda like, you're, you know. You know.... You don't know!
I'm sorry. Hey, at least you guys get to go home and be with your families tonight. I have to go back to an empty hotel room and lay down on a very questionable bedspread. And then tomorrow morning, you get to have Christmas morning in your own houses, wich, by the way, none of you have invited me to.
Oh that's not true! That's not true! I got her that backpack and she loved it! I remember how much she was crying the day when that big dog ran off with it... Oh, there was no big dog. All right this sucks! I already got her this briefcase, and I had R.G. put on it... Her initials...
It was working until you showed up, you big tree! I mean, this isn't fair. You had your chance with her! You had your chance and you blew it! And this is my chance and I am not going to blow it because we are meant for each other! And this is all just been one stupid mistake! I was gonna propose tonight.
OK, well that's the part where I'm a wank. But I was hoping we wouldn't focus on that. Hey, c'mon man, I said I was sorry like a hundred times, I promise I will never take it off my. . . wrist. But if, if you want to stay in there and be mad, you know, you just uh, you stay in there.
So... Oklahoma is a crazy place. You know, they call it the Sooner state. Frankly I'd sooner be in any other state. And what's with Oklahoma having a pan handle? Can all states have stuff like that? Hey yeah, I'm from the waistband, Wyoming. But when I was seven, we headed over to the crotch.
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow. Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow. . She's insane, the woman is insane. It's before work, it's after work, it's during work. She's got me doing butt clenches at my desk. And now, they won't bring me my mail anymore.
All right everybody! Just be quiet! Be quiet! Be quiet!! Pipe-pipe-pipe down! What is the matter with you people?! This woman was trying to do a nice thing for you. She was making candy so she could try to get to know all of you, and I'll bet that not one of you can tell me her name! Am I right?
Look at this. Pictures of all the women that Heckles went out with. Look what he wrote on them. Vivian, too tall. Madge, big gums. Too loud, too smart, makes noise when she eats. This is, this is me. This is what I do. I'm gonna end up alone, just like he did.
I'm sorry. I'm-I'm-I'm sorry that I said I was going to when I'm not. Look, this has nothing to do with you, y'know? And this isn't Rachel's fault. It's me. I have serious, serious problems when it comes to women. I have issues with commitment, intimacy, mascara goop. And I'm really sorry, it's just that this is not, this isn't going to work out.
Look, Ross, you gotta understand, between us we haven't had a relationship that has lasted longer than a Mento. You, however have had the love of a woman for four years. Four years of closeness and sharing at the end of which she ripped your heart out, and that is why we don't do it! I don't think that was my point!
No, no resentment, believe me, it's worth it. 'Kay? Y'know in a relationship you have these key moments that you know you'll remember for the rest of your life? Well, every- single- second is like that with Aurora.. and I've just wasted about thirty-five of them talking to you people, so, uh.. Monica, can you help me with the door?
Oh it's been going on way to long now. Y'know, I mean the first time he said it we were just passing each other in the hallway, so I didn't say anything. And then the next time he said, "Hey Toby, do you want a donut?" And I-I wanted a donut. And now it's five years later, the donut's gone and I'm still Toby.
You know what? You know what? I think we're making too big a deal out of this. ok? So we pay our bills a little late this month and maybe next month we cut back on a few things. And maybe we start eating out of Joey's refrigerator for a change. You're chef... what can you make out of backing soda and beer?
I'm totally screwed. Okay, they are gonna be hot and heavy on stage every night, and then they're gonna go to their cast parties and he's gonna try to undermine me. Y'know it'll be like, "So where's your boyfriend, what's-his-name, Chester?" And she'll go, "No-no-no, it's Chandler." And he'll go, "Whatever. Ha-ha-ha-ha!"
Couldn't sleep last night you know, then I started worrying about this big divisional meeting that I have later today, the more I worried about it the more I couldn't sleep. Y'know? I was like, if I fall asleep now I'll get six hours sleep, but if I fall asleep now I'll get five hours sleep. Not matter what I did I couldn't fall asleep.
What's with the word y'all? You know, just... two words just... pushed together... Are we all allowed to do that, because if so, I say why stop there? You know, your new poodle could be your noodle. And fried chicken? Could be fricken.Waiter, waiter excuse me, I'll have the fricken? See, that's... that's funny with the fricken, right?
Sure I do. In fact, I think the whole concept of marriage is unnatural. I mean look at pigs. Let's take a second here and look at pigs. Okay pigs don't mate for life. I mean a pig can have like a hundred sexual partners in a lifetime, and that's just an ordinary pig not even a pig that's good at sports!
Hey. Well, you will all be pleased to know that I have a date tomorrow night. This woman, Alison, from work. She's great. She's pretty, she's smart. And uh, I've been holding off on asking her out in the past, because she has an unusually large head. But, I'm not gonna let that stuff hang me up anymore. Look at me. I'm growing.
No, that's okay. Monica I thought this was going to be the most difficult thing I ever gonna had to do. But when I saw you walking down that aisle I realized how simple it was. I love you. Any surprises that come our way it's okay, because I will always love you. You are the person I was meant to spend the rest of my life with. You wanna know if I'm sure?
No, it's not! When I looked at the other ring I could see Monica's face when I gave it to her, y'know? And I could see her saying yes. When I look at this ring, all I see is a ring! Unless I look at it really closely and then I can see my own eye. Look, this is the most important thing I'm gonna do in my life. I wanna make sure it's perfect.
I think you should go back with Gary. I don't wanna be the guy that breaks up a family, y'know when my parents split up, it was because of that guy. Whenever I would see him I was always think y'know 'You're the reason, you are the reason why their not together.' and I hated that guy. And it didn't matter how nice he was, or how happy he made my Dad.
Oh good, okay, I can't take it anymore. I can't take it anymore. So you win, okay? Here! Pheebs? Flying a jet? Better make it a spaceship so that you can get back to your home planet! And Ross, phone call for you today, Tom Jones, he wants his pants back! And Hornswoggle? What are you dating a character from Fraggile Rock?!
Okay! Okay! Okay! Oh God, I thought... Wait a minute, I-I can do this. I thought that it mattered what I said or where I said it. Then I realized the only thing that matters is that you, you make me happier than I ever thought I could be. And if you'll let me, I will spend the rest of my life trying to make you feel the same way. Monica, will you marry me?
Oh no thats okay, you're totally right. I don't know anything about disciplining a child. But it did hurt my feelings and I want you to know that when I die, you don't get Joey. Ross walks away with a face of yeah ok. Amy walks over to the couch and sits down next to Rachel: Ucch. Uchh In case you hadn't noticed, I'm not talking to you.
Monica, that was also true an hour ago! I mean, please, look at you! Your hand is blistered, you can barely stand, your hair is inexplicable! Ok, you've already proven you are just as good as he is, now we've missed our dinner reservations, so now let's just go upstairs, order room service, take a shower and shave your head!
And! They like me more just because I was with ya! I think you repaired a lot of the damage from when they met Joey. And Doug wants us to play tennis with them. He's never even talked to me outside of work. Except for that time when we bumped into each other at that strip club. Strip church. Anyway, I'm gonna go try and find a racquet.
Okay! Okay! Okay! I'll do it! Oh God, I thought... Wait a minute, I-I can do this. I thought that it mattered what I said or where I said it. Then I realized the only thing that matters is that you, you make me happier than I ever thought I could be. And if you'll let me, I will spend the rest of my life trying to make you feel the same way. Monica, will you marry me?
No! Danielle, hi! It's, uh, it's Chandler! I'm fine. Uh, listen, I don't know if you tried to call me, because, uh, idiot that I am, I accidentally shut off my phone. Oh, uh, okay, that's fine, that's great. Okay. She's on the other line, she's gonna call me back. She's on the other line, she's gonna call me back, she's on the other line, gonna call me back...
Y'know, I don't know if you've ever looked up the term goofing around in the dictionary... Well, I have, and the technical definition is, two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just wanna spend more time together. But if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me, then we have to, y'know, get you my original dictionary. I am so bad at this.
Well, stuff like where'd we live, y'know? Like a small place outside the city, where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff. Y'know, we could have a cat that had a bell on it's collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door. Of course, we'd have an apartment over the garage where Joey could grow old.

Excuse me, look, we've been here for over an hour, and a lot of people less sick than my friend have gone in. I mean, that guy with the toe thing? Who's he sleeping with? Oh, c'mon Dora, don't be mad... I know we both said some things we didn't mean, but that doesn't mean we still don't love each other. Y'know, I feel like I've lost her.. Ba-!
Okay, I went over to Ross' apartment to bring back Clunkers. Y'know, for you, and... I left the door open and she must have gotten out and I looked everywhere, all over the apartment, including the roof, which FYI Ross, one of your neighbors, growing weed. I couldn't find him, and I am so, so, so, sorry. But I do know where we could all go ease the pain.
...Well, y'know, part of me wants that, but it's like I'm two guys, y'know? I mean, one guy's going 'Shut up! This is great!' But there's this other guy. Actually it's the same guy that wells up every time that Grinch's heart grows three sizes and breaks that measuring device... And he's saying, y'know, 'This is too hard! Get out! Get out!'
Oh come on guys, it's not like I moved to Europe! I just moved across the hall! And we would have you over all the time if it weren't for Monica's allergies. You're right, I could never lie to you. She hates you. Should I get that? Hello? Uh no, Joey's not here right now. Can I take a message? Yeah, okay so the audition has been moved from 5:00 to 2:30? Okay great. Bye.
Well, first of all, they're not called "sneakers" anymore. Apparently, they're called "kicks" or "skids" and I think I heard somebody say "slorps". And here, look: they've got these wheels to pop out from the bottom so you can roll around 'cause, apparently, walking is too much exercise. Kids, kids, roll your way to childhood obesity! Would you help me try to sell these?
Okay, what do you saw I go over there and say how much I like her? No-no it'll be good, I can tell her much I've been thinking about her. That I haven't stopped thinking about her since the moment I met her. That I'm so fantastically, over-the-top, wanna-slit-my-own-throat in love with her, that for every minute of every hour of every day I can't believe my own damn bad luck that you met her first!!
I'd like to toast, Ross and Emily. Of course, my big toast will be tomorrow at the wedding, so this is kind of my little toast or Melba toast, if you will. Okay. I known Ross for a long time. In fact, I knew him when he was going out with his first girlfriend. And I thought things were going to work out for him.. Until the day he over inflated her. Ohh, Dear God..
Well look, it's not easy to spend this much time apart, you know. She's entitled to be a little paranoid... or, in this case: right on money! ... You know, she's amazing, and beautiful, and smart, and if she were here right now, ...she'd kick your ass. Look, you're a really nice person... ham stealing and adultery aside. But, what I have with my wife is pretty great, so nothing is ever gonna happen between us.
If I'm gonna be an old, lonely man, I'm gonna need a thing, you know, a hook, like that guy on the subway who eats his own face. So I figure I'll be Crazy Man with a Snake, yknow. Crazy Snake Man. And I'll get more snakes, call them my babies, kids will walk past my place, they will run. "Run away from Crazy Snake Man," they'll shout!
Night-night.....Janice. 'Look at all that room on her side, you good fit a giant penguin over there. That would be weird though. Okay, hug and roll time. I'm huggin', I'm huggin', your rollin', and....yes! Freedom! Except for this arm! I'm stuck. Stuck arm! Okay, time for the old table cloth trick, one fluid motion. Quick like a cat, quick like a cat! And 1...2...3!'
Joey? Got you a Joey Special, two pizzas! Joe? Hello? Damnit! Hello? No, Joey's not here right now, but I can take a message I think. He's still got a chance for the part?! Oh, that's great news! Well no obviously not for the actor who was mauled by his dog. Oh well, that's great. I will give Joey the message. Thank you! Yes! Okay, Mac audition at 2:00. Allergy actor attacked. By dog not flowers.
It just keeps getting worse and worse! Y'know? I mean it's bad enough that I'm in love with my roommates girlfriend-which by the way, I think she knows. Because every time we're in the room together there's this weird like energy between us. And call me crazy, but I think she likes me too. And now I have seen her naked. I mean at least when I've seen her with clothes on, I could imagine her body was like covered in boles or something. But there are no boles, she's smooth! Smooth!
I'd like to propose a toast. Little toast here, ding ding. I know this isn't the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting. Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know? So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.
No-no all kids are embarrassed by their parents, you'd have to come up with a whole new word for what I went through. When I was in High School, he used to come to all of my swim meets dressed as a different Hollywood starlet. Y'know it's hard enough to be fourteen. You're skinny. You're wearing speedoes-That your mom promised that you would grow into! And you look up into the stands and there's your dad cheering you on dressed as Carmen Miranda. We was wearing a headdress with real fruit that he will later hand out to your friends as a healthy snack!
Hey Mr. Kostelic! How's life on the fifteenth floor? Yeah, I miss you too. Yeah, it's a lot less satisfying to steal pens from your own home, you know? Well, that's very generous er, but look, this isn't about the money. I need something that's more than a job. I need something I can really care about.... And that's on top of the yearly bonus structure you mentioned earlier? Look, Al, Al... I'm not playing hardball here, OK? This is not a negotiation, this is a rejection! No! No! No, stop saying numbers! I'm telling you, you've got the wrong guy! You've got the wrong guy! I'll see you on Monday!
