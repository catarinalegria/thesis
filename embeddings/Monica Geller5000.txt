Wait, you like them with me.
Oh no! What's the matter?
It's a diaper commercial.
But my clothes are-ohh!
Did you just flick me?
Alright, alright, alright...
Yeah, that's a big step.
Hey! How's it goin'?
He took my snack!
Let's go big bunny!
No. I hate this part.
You have dinosaur checks?
We're switching rooms.
That sounds like Nana.
Who, who are they?
We won't. 300?
Rachel, there's nothing in it.
How who wears it?
Jeez! What is with you?
I'm gonna start getting ready!
Hey! Good, you're home!
It's so good, isn't it?
Well, I hope you're happy!
Y'know what? You're-you're right.
The good stuff, huh?
Okay. Ow!!!!! Ow-oh-oh!
Put your head back.
They've arrested Monica.
Aww, honey I'm sorry.
Shut up, I'm happy.
In...in two weeks.
Well, I was having a conversation.
No. See you don't understand.
You did a minute ago!
We were playing a game.
What happened to your teeth.
Come on, no peeking!
So do them for free.
Yeah, I'd really like to.
Oh, god help us.
Oh no-no-no, it's still me.
I don't feel good right now.
All right, what's going on?
Honey! Dinner's ready!
Not at these prices.
So, are you ready to go?
Who's David Lynn?
Well, maybe you don't need them.
I'm changing out of this.
I can't believe it! I lost!
No that's, that's okay.
Joey, you have to talk to her!
This is all of your things.
I thought that was a good thing.
Oh, an old glove?
I know. Closing credits.
Well, apparently she does.
Regular or decaf?
The best man? Wow!
Yes! Have you seen it?
Hi, nice to meet you!
Ross, thats my jacket.
Well you did a little bit.
Rach, here's your mail.
I'm so glad you liked it.
Y'know what, I like Kathy.
We all chipped in.
Chandler! What are you doing here?
I would love to do it together!
Or incredibly offensive.
Let's get the show on it!
They hurt so much!
Why, how much is that?
Why did you hire me?
Okay, what's going on with you?
All right, check me out.
Best out of three?
I am, aren't I?
There's the man I married!!
No really, they're OK.
Yeah, but without the costumes.
I wanna wear this everyday.
...What did I ask?
I can't believe you didn't tell me.
Y'know what? You are right?!
Let's get you out of here!!
Well, what about his family?
Phoebe, you don't eat animals.
I am not high maintenance!
And he's a great brother!
It's Monica, open up!
Hell, I wanna see Joey.
Who the hell are you?!
And Rachel. And that's Chandler.
Pheebs, how's it going?
I'm not gonna go out with him.
I'm engaged!!!!!! I'm engaged!!!!
Oh no, we can't walk!
It's very interesting, Phoebe.
What?! People don't do that!
Phoebe, you are a bad ass!
Well, you're not working either.
What's wrong with PBS?
Oh.... my... God.
What's with all this sand?
Was it really that good?
Now, open your eyes.
Barry who you almost...?
What else did you think about?
Wh-wh-what are you doing here?
Two thousand dollars?
Well, thanks, we like him.
What's fish hooking?
Worked like a charm.
Hello. Oh, hey Ross!
Phoebe, where's your purse?
Chandler, why are you doing this?
Hey, Rach, how was work?
Alright, you wanna feel better?
Yes, he is. Me.
I...I have to fire him.
Oh, wait a minute honey.
Y'know maybe a little bit!
Yeah, I'm sorry. I really am.
No-no, don't-don't-don't do it!
How did you get in there?!
Can I ask you a question?
Look at you with all the guys!
Where do you want to start?
We're with you. We got it.
There were only twelve.
Gotta keep squishing.
That's not 'til Thursday.
She stole my jeans!
And that's Pete's Mom.
Oh yeah, what's the plan?
About nineteen pounds.
Come on Rach, let's go.
How about fifty bucks?
So you had fun, huh?
Yeah? The work problem?
It's almost our anniversary!
Does anybody want these?
Um, Pennsylvania Dutch.
I do not have baby fever!
Oh my God, you're a freak.
Oh, none for me. Thanks.
Because then I don't have to!
You want some help with that?
Yeah! She's right in there!
Thunder being stolen!!
I got you the foot massager.
You like Green Bay?
That doesn't seem fair.
I so wanna be attracted to you.
God, what is wrong with me.
How was your first day?
Ross, we can handle this.
He is right, isn't he?
No, just a Friday night.
Ugh, I thought you were Rachel!
Look at you. All jealous.
OK, um. Goodbye.
Wow! You made a profit!
Honey, you gotta talk to her.
I never stop thinking about it.
This totally makes sense!
Then why are you laughing?
Then why are you smoking?
Oh man! I did it again!
Oh, now you want a pad.
Oh, I'm- I'm so sorry!
Hey Phoebe! Guess what?
All right? What's going on?
It's hard for some people!
I'll pick it up for you!
Is it the Italian guy?
Y'know, just be there for her.
How about Mockolate mousse?
What the hell are you cooking!
NO, NO, NOOO!
Scary pigeon's back?
I'm sorry, my friend Phoebe...
So how does it look?
Yeah. That-that was the problem.
So, did I hear Poconos?
Joey, we have something to tell you.
It's Chandler! Are you OK?
You kissed another woman!
Rachel said everything was okay.
Well, what am I going to say?
It's for their own good.
That would be a good idea.
Oh my God. Richard? Hi!
Now calm down Joey.
You realize what you are don't you?
How'd the lecture go?
You stole them from me!
Yeah! I bet I can do it.
What is wrong with you?!!!
Well, she saw the ring.
You can, I know you can!
No Phoebe I am mad!
Ow. Ow. Ow.
This is my favorite part.
That's what you say about porn.
Awww. But still no.
See he's nice. Right?
Never done that before.
That I was going to eat him.
And who pays for that?
That was gonna be my opener.
Yes that would be lovely.
Okay, it's ready. Come on.
I highly doubt that.
You really think that'll work?
But ehm...what is it not?
What are you doing with those?!
His indian name?
Oh well, it's not so bad.
Yes, you're having a boy!
Really? The scientist guy?
Yeah, he's gonna work on that.
Ow, what are the chances!
Well, we certainly are alone.
Hi, glad you could come.
Hi, Chandler. There you are.
Here's your tea Phoebe.
Well, I just lost my erection.
You look cute in bubbles.
Are you serious? Oh my God.
And what else is it not?
Yes! Okay! Okay! Wait-wait-wait!
Oh wait.. What are you doing?
Wanna give me a hand?
Sure, I love this part!
I'm not a baby, you're the baby.
From here to the airport?
Really, is he a swimmer?
Oh yeah, I totally agree.
This isn't even my dress.
If you want, I'll do it.
She will be after tonight.
All right, so what do you say?
How'd you pay for them?
Ok, um, I'll go with you.
I don't know what else to say.
So, what are you saying now?
I can't believe you're getting married!
Kiss him, you fool!!
Why? Because of the government.
Well actually, Ross doesn't.
Oh, did you catch him?!
Well then get it, get it!
Just uh, do the right thing.
Okay, hold on a sec.
Alright, here you go, sweetie.
Did she leave a number?
Okay. Don't you want a cookie?
Oh my God, this is horrible!
Joey?! Oh my God, Rachel!
Let me ask you a question.
He's gonna eat the cake!
It's just that, it's so much.
Why don't you just get a roommate?
Hey, aren't you up next?
Hi Pheebs, what's up?
That's a good call. Right.
Well, we had a little fight.
We are not going to whistle.
That is sooo not true!
Maybe this wasn't your shot.
Oh... what does that mean?
There's more beer, right?
In case it happens.
We're okay. I'm still ovulating.
So have you called her yet?
You wanted it to be a surprise.
Yeah, we're trying to get pregnant.
That's what it sounded like.
Oh, So you can move them!
Then why did you move?!
We'll be waiting for you...
Excuse me Mr. Mexico.
Rach, wait, I can cancel...
'I drink tea.'
Okay. Let's bring it in.
How desperate am I?
Not as each other!
Just the matter of ...payment?
Wait Chandler, what are you doing?!
Why did they get divorced?
The baby shower for Phoebe!
You need to give him money.
Oh, there's banana on it.
Does it have to do with Joey?
Wait, he's not here yet.
Please, I'm not going for anything.
You think we're being obvious?
Oh my God, it was incredible.
Well, don't 'cha wanna?
You're so efficient. I love you!
You're plans were with us.
Stick out your tongue.
What have you heard me sing?
So um, who was she?
Hey, did you stop by here?
Who wants it? Anybody?
Alright, who wants to do it?
What? Why, why would...
They're still in my coat.
His dancing partner?!
You just carry that around?
So, did you two have fun?
Hi.. how was the game?
Some moms do that.
And slept with the professor.
Oh. Can I have a tissue?
Oh well, where is he?!
He's retiling my floor.
That is so sweet. I love you.
Phoebe, it's been two days.
This doesn't concern you!!
Oh, is everything in the car?
Try feeding her again.
I don't know, clean places?
Oh. You're not gettin' it.
Crematorium Chris? Sure!
So'd you guys have fun?
Okay I'll take her, here.
Oh yeah, what are you reading?
What were you doing in Africa?
How about, you're moving!!
Does it involve clogs?
Does it involve travel?
But you told them you weren't?
Too strong for me?
Yep! You got the tickets?
So-so there is no party.
Still smoking cigars?
What are you smiling at?
Uh sorry, wrong number.
Well, it just seems that...
No, no! Give it to me!
I don't think this number's right!
Did you break up with her?
Chandler, this actually bothers you?
IT'S THE HUMIDITY!
So! He'll understand!
THAT'S NOT ME!
Yep, we wanna get married!
Ross, I thought you were over this.
It's 9:30 in the morning!
I'm so glad you liked them!
Are you sure you wanna do this?
Hey, did you pick a roommate?
Oh, you are so great! Thank you!
Well, who's voice was that?
I know. I need more pie.
Let me get you some coffee.
So, where do you want to go?
How-how are you, Mom?
I used to wet my bed.
Yeah, but I don't think we have time.
Well...I'd better get going.
Just some stuff for the party.
Ooh, are you gonna do magic?
Okay, now you're even cuter!!
Joey look it's really sweet...
We have got to wash that!
Hey guys! Dinner's ready!
I can't believe we're living here!
What uh-What did you-What?!
Ross's parents are my parents!
You know, a party, or--
Hey, Rach, how's it going?
Makes me wanna puke!
Why else would we be here?
Joey! I'm so proud of you!
That was a terrible throw!!
I feel terrible, I really do.
Joey, you don't have to finish that.
No, I just, I fell down.
Your mother told you this?
Wafer thin ice!
Hey Joey, come taste this.
Does seem pretty perfect.
You painting his toenails?
Okay well that's good to know.
Ohh my God, I'm so sorry.
Okay, I think I get how to do this.
We are! Help us!
Why don't you just take it with you?
So, did you know Ross well?
Joey! Now that you're here...
When did I sign for it?
Okay, I freaked out a little.
What are you doing with the lamp?
How 'bout just a boom?
How? I don't have any money.
That noise you just made?
Oh, let's not tell this story.
No it's not, it's second.
You become friends after?
Wait what-wh-wh-what are you doing?!
Hi, I'm Ross's little sister.
I knew you didn't get a 1400!
Wow, you worked in a mine?
Oh. Why didn't you take her?
Sometimes I have bad dreams.
Uch, you see, I'm ovulating.
I was in too much pain.
I can't tell you. It's a secret.
You're not gonna mess it up.
Well, uh, I ate some.
Score! Now can we go?
Yeah but I'm not keeping it.
Really? Your work laugh?
Um, I'm not actually Amish.
Yeah, I'm sorry. I'm-I'm so sorry.
Two girls and a boy?
Yeah, well they suck too.
You're not just saying that are you?
So you didn't leave the bank?
No-no-no, no! It's sensual!
Why isn't it working out?
That's that weird voice again.
Oh, dad, turn it off.
This is your current cellphone?
Are we gonna take a limo?
You mean your pink shirt?
How, how did that happen?
Viva Las Gaygas!
Or Spin the Bottle?
We haven't eaten yet!
Pete's breaking up with me.
You know what? You can have mine.
'Cause you invited your assistant.
Hey. It's him. Who is it?
"Marriage. It's not for everybody."
You know what? Let's not talk.
Hey, guess what I'm doing tonight.
The green dress? Really?
Nooooo. You're really not going?
Okay, we're gonna need a distraction.
I'm gonna set them to my time.
Nothing. I'm gonna take a shower.
So, what have you guys been doing?
I thought there wasn't a ball?
Oh, why? Why? What happened?
Oh, no no no no no.
Okay fine, now Ross...
But Chandler lent you money!
Oh, I ordered mine first.
You did it! You got ordained?!
I told you not to go down there!
Chandler is such an idiot!
And well, what did she say?
I know, that's why I said again!
Come here. Okay, be right back.
No, sweetie, I-I trust you.
Wait! Did you say 'G.Stephanopoulos?'
But, I just cleaned the bathroom.
Men are such idiots.
Pheebes, you know what I'm thinking?
Guys, we bought the tickets.
Hi! Hey look who's here!
Just go get some! Go!
Score!! 7 to nothing!
Does that sound like Janice?
You still work at the multiplex?
Put all my money in me.
That's it! Dinner is over!
Yeah I do rock that one.
Oh, so you like her too Chandler?
Something to remember me by!
Could not be more terrified.
Was your cabin pressurised?
And I would have to say pah-huh.
Hello? It's the deli again!
You slept with her didn't you?
Serve the ball, chump!
I used to love to play restaurant.
We checked. A lot.
That's right Patrick, bye-bye!
Why are so mad at him?
I'm actually with her on this one.
See? It's no big deal.
You're right. Maybe I shouldn't go.
And I'm going to go get drunk.
What?! You said he was sweet!
Okay-okay, I got it. I got it.
Who? Is that your sister?
Hon, you gotta talk to Joey.
Yes, but we have to be fast.
Rach, did you check the machine?
Oh, I'm gonna kill those guys.
Because the winner gets this!
So, should I call him back?
What?! You slept with Jason?
Really? Who's number two?
Did you just smell my hair?
Dammit, dammit, dammit!
Lucky bastard! Janice.
Thirty-two! Seventy-one! Hike!
007 gets all the ladies.
Well, I guess now we can't go.
That's probably what they'll say.
You didn't dress up either?!
I'm talking about me having a baby.
I'll give you really good odds.
Oh my God! Kyle Lowder!
Joey! You didn't even know her!
... everybody we know? Yeah.
No, that is what the game is.
Oh my god, what were you thinking?
What are you the memory woman?
He might still show up.
Oh-ho-ho, we've got company.
All right, what's goin' on?
Do you want me to pick you?!
I can't find garbage bags!
Oh wait I forgot my wrap.
Phoebe, you'll catch pneumonia.
We're never gonna find anybody.
Phoebe, stop writing about us!
Ten dollars an hour.
About a half an hour.
Wasn't there a little song?
Excuse me, where are you going?
Please, guys, we have to talk.
Pass the cheese, please.
We didn't order cake.
Yes? ..yes, she is.
Do you know anything about women?
Oh, wait, and I got a beeper!
All right, I'll try not to.
What about the rest of Manhattan?!
Phoebe, what, what happened here?!
Joey, you know you don't actually have one.
Honey, sweetie, by the edges.
You al-you already had it?
Not a basset, a bassinet.
Okay, he was talking about rules.
Did you go home and change?
Oh great! Did you get a movie?
Oh, I can't pass for 22?
She lets you borrow them.
Then why would he say it?
All right, I guess we should go.
What is the matter with your hand?
Chip, is Chip Matthews.
Ok, you have to stop playing now.
I know! What is this, 1985?!
Fine, I can do it. Whew.
You guys, I am not that bad!
Really? If that's what you want...
Is that a bit you guys do?
Then I've gotta go. Bye.
Rachel! Let me in! Rachel!
Soakin' up all the culture.
Does that smell bother you?
Oh, he's catching up to her!
Wow. Joey, how do you do it?
It might be kinda cool.
Just don't pick up your phone.
Wow! She is pretty, huh?
Hey Chandler, wanna do it with me?
That's right. Did you hear something?
Is he gonna introduce us?
Then I won't have to kill you.
Are you saying I smell bad?
Okay! All right! Let's do it!
Hi, how are you doing Kelly?
You just wanna each take one?
Relax! It's Phoebe! Not you!
Who wasn't invited to the wedding.
Maybe, do you need a tissue?
Yeah, it's just something I picked up.
Ahhh! You are on my list.
Why don't you just go out with her!
See if he has ice.
Hey, I thought you already had one.
I'll get it! Happy Thanksgiving!
So she's a woman! So what?
The second sister dies?!
Okay, you ready to open yours?
You wanna get out of my face?
You owe me 20 bucks.
About a week and a half.
From the tequila factory?
Yeah? I'm proud of me too.
Well, you're not gonna get going are you?
You used the Europe story!
Okay mister! Fertilize me!
Hey, are we still on for tonight?
Bye... bye... BIRDIE.
Hugh! Hugh Grant!
One-Mississippi. Two-Mississippi. Three-Mississippi.
W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-...
Sweety, what are you talking about?
This woman's living my life.
What did I tell you about the hall?!
I thought you could use the help.
You're kidding! Where? Where?
Oh, baths are so relaxing!
Hey Joey, sweetie, taste this.
Wh?! What about my allergies?!
We didn't give you any money!
Did you make brownies today?
Love is the best medicine.
Oh, we're not doing that. Okay...
I clunked your heads together!
We'll put buckles on it.
Why the hell did you take her?
Oh, we're not seeing a movie!
Okay, can we please go eat?
It's actually going to be just family.
Just go over and say hi.
So, what are we gonna do today?
Ooh...hey honey, are you all right?
Oh my God, we're gonna be parents!
I miss Rachel. No, my parents.
Yep! And lot's of it!
I didn't take a pregnancy test.
And this goes for all guys?
Oh! So you think I'm a failure!
We just want you to think it through.
Hey, how did the audition go?
I can't believe you let them win!
What is it?! What about Pete?
Aw, it's soo unfair.
We didn't get anything for anyone.
Breaks your heart doesn't it.
No, I'm wearing a wedding dress.
I'll get back to my new job.
Damn it! Rookie mistake!
Wh-what are we gonna tell him?
Okay. Umm, Phoebe, you suck too.
Yeah, I think you should keep looking!
Okay, if you really wanna have sex...
Haven't we made this decision?
Yeah, okay, give that a try!
So I got it when I was 13...
Why do you want to see my hand?
Tell me about yourself, Zack!
It was hard! Phoebe: Hey!
I'm sorry, idea time is over.
Rachel's really the one who's pregnant.
Oh my God, what are you gonna do?!
So-so you would've just lied?
No, no, no, that's Dina.
What kind of karate is that?
Oh my God, I was thinking four.
Hey Pheebs, how's it going?
Oh my God! Are-are you crying?
Do you think he knew I was here?
I've gotta get back in the game.
Twelve dollars an hour.
That was a half an hour?
Where did you get those jeans?!
You start working on that list.
We're switching rooms again.
Cause I already invited her.
Hey, you got me, put it in.
Hi, that's what I'm doing for Phoebe!
Yes, they can stay with us.
Really, you want to wait a year?
But you live here! You know that.
Well, you tell a lot of jokes!
Dr. Burke, it, it's me.
Wow! That is a great picture!
What a minute, what did he say?
You're not gonna be phased out!
Promise me you'll be careful.
Spoon? So, what do you think?
Well then we still have a problem.
Yeah, just like the one in the poem.
Anything larger back there?
Can you believe Phoebe got pregnant?!
You're mother killed herself!
Fine. Go! Go! Go!
Phoebe, your liver is right here.
Oh, you got the whole night, huh?
Yeah, but at least I'm doing it!
Phoebe, we lost half of them.
That thing is not coming in here.
What, he doesn't like Josh?
The wedding starts at six.
Yes. But all the other ones.
That's Phoebe! Where did you get that?
This is not the bed I ordered!
Pete, can I get you something else?
Stop it Chandler. I'm sorry too.
I have no idea what you just said.
Yeah! Roses or Lilies?
Yeah, come on, we can be guys!
We are on a roll, people!!
Okay, I'm done. Read mine.
OK. Just for a little while.
So, what do you think we should do?
You gave her food poisoning!?
Rachel, what're you gonna say to him?
That's-that's not Phase Three.
Feeling a little better sweetie?
It's my New Year's resolution!
Oh, look, he's waking up!
Okay, throw it straight this time.
It was a really beautiful service.
Oh, thank you! What's going on?
What? I-I said you had a-
My parents will be so happy.
What if I turn out the lights?
Ross, he's got the remote again.
Thank you Joey, thank you so much!
Okay, let's talk about something else.
Y'know...go! Go! Right there!
He's totally flirting with you too.
You wanna fool around with Joey?
Sweetie, I wanted you to have him too.
I knew you were not okay with that.
That's so sweet. Find anything?
And I've got the car keys.
Oh my God! It's like one mind.
What do you do with your money now?
: Hi, how was your flight?
No-no! Don't do it! Don't!
Hey honey! I missed you today!
Wow! That guy is so rude!
Oh, I'm sorry. Can I get you something?
Phoebe, you're gonna be with your grandma?
It is not over! You're over!
Maybe he didn't give you a chance.
Yeah, he's just gotta get a shot.
Shoot! We're out of soda.
No. He's not a horrible guy.
What are you doing here so early?
I have to be up in seven minutes.
Hell no, we'll pay!
That's because I'm in front of them.
Ross, I can't believe you'd do that!
Okay! Oh my God, thank you!!
Okay, he's a senior in college.
Oh, I didn't know you liked football.
It's gonna be a problem, isn't it?
All right, we should call somebody.
I don't have her number, butt-munch.
Friday's perfect...She can't wait.
Okay that does sound like fun.
How's the big anniversary dinner?
So you hit her in the face?
Rach, come see who's out here!
Yeah, you have to go fight for her!
They won't take you to the vet.
Phoebe, can I talk to you for a second?
Yes, but you are dead inside.
That is a slap in the face.
As much as they love you?
Third door on the left.
The pink one with the flowers?!
Y'know which one was she again?
Umm, can we see you ride it?
Chandler, you're not gonna die alone.
What if they get mixed up?
Okay, here comes another camera.
Sit down! We're winning!
Well Phoebe doesn't eat turkey...
Well, at least you scared someone.
Yes!! Yes! Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Oh sweetie, I'm so proud of you!
So how's it going with you guys?
Rach, he's a friend of ours.
I know, I just thought it would be fun.
Oh, they-they sent me home.
It's kind of an important one!
All right, I...I have to ask.
Really? My God, he's really cute.
Would you stop staring at her?
It's coming from the living room.
Oh. Maybe they're- napping.
Electrical plans for the building.
It's kind of a package deal!
Weeeell, it's rum, and-
I'm sorry, I'll give it back to you.
Oh, but it's made her so happy.
Who are they killing off?
okay, Pheebs, theyre gone.
Rachel, the cute doctors are here.
What do you think brought than on?
Oh, I love it! Thank you so much!
Chandler, I'm gonna die a virgin!
I thought you were going out with Elizabeth.
Come on! It wasn't that bad!
No, it's more like a good luck.
Hey, Rach, did you make your money?
They have racquets don't they?!
I wanna watch Entertainment Tonight.
Heads! No, Tails! He-he-heads!
Do you know what's a bad idea?
Yes! And that would be a shut-down!
All right, I'll see you guys later.
Really? I only had two glasses.
Hi, Dad, what are you doing here?
Okay, Phoebe you know what you're doing right?
Yeah, what, do you think we're stupid?
I can't be fair. You're my boyfriend.
Will! From high school.
Come on! I really need your help!
Yeah. What d'you wanna do tonight?
What are you talking about? What wedding?
Whoa!!! Are you kidding me?!
Oh that's sweet. Don't touch me.
That's it big girl! Come on!
It's nice to meet you. Janine...?
Well, why would she lie to you?
Yeah! Oh he's great, I love him.
Hey! How'd the audition go?!
So what did you do today Pete?
No, you are not. We tell you stuff.
Ahh, Phoebe, I'm gonna miss you!
I just wanted to see how it's going.
Phoebe, come on, you have to tell us.
So, are you sorry that I told them?
Here, take a couple of these.
Well there's not much we can do.
I'm just trying to spice it up!
007 has a fancy car!
Why would they think they're invited?
That's Will from high school!
Oh, but wait I do have a globe.
What?! You're going out with her again!
Ready for your birthday lunch?
Pulling what? It's second down.
I just thought he was nice, y'know?
No-no-no! We need something old!
I am so glad you said cooks.
That bastard taped over me!
I'll meet you there in two minutes.
Ross, cough drops, please?
Rachel, get the book! The book!
Well, why don't we just bunny up.
So, is Joey gonna stop snoring?
Did I squeeze it too hard?
Hey Rach, somebody got you shoes!
Yes, I did! And you are welcome!
Did they just kill off Joey?
In 1981 you were 13!
Oh my God. He threw up?
Rach! It's me! Pick up!
Why is this car in my bedroom?
I gave you a key for emergencies!
I know.. it's gonna be really hard.
Good. And Rachel Green too.
Your a poet and don't know it.
Chandler! Phoebe's hogging the game!
So to get this part you can't be?
Yeah, that'd be great! Thank you!
Then all your stuff would be here.
All right, let's go say good-bye.
Isn't he an architect now?
Please tell me it's his mother.
Well do something! Get in there!
All right, what about the third guy?
Chandler's making his sex face.
You know what, everything's gonna be okay.
Never call me from that phone.
Chandler? Can you give me a hand?
Oh, you're breaking up with Tony?
No! Rachel is meeting us here.
Oop, your cake is ready!
Why do you care so much anyway?
That's it. That's my worse Thanksgiving.
I make the decisions, and I say no.
Have you found your dress yet?
Oh good, I think so too. Pheebs?
Oh-ho, look what I got Julio.
I know! Hey, how's Chandler doin'?
Oh my God, are you out of a job?
You don't want to know what tonight was.
I swear you said you had the keys.
C'mon guys, it'll be fun!
Maybe I do! I'm pretty feisty!
I need to borrow a hundred bucks.
Phoebe! Put that cigarette out!
Why don't you go see Dr. Gettleman?
I'm sure they'll be here soon.
So you watched the movies huh?
Nobody cares about the Dakotas.
Oh my God Chandler! I can't believe it!
Well, you could actually go to the gym.
Stop it!! That's not funny!!
Oh God, I am so sorry honey...
You still have feelings for me don't you?
Wait! Oh my God! I can't get out!
No, I just I think that it's too soon.
You're gonna do some feet flirtin'!
Oh my God Phoebe, you're on fire!
I don't need a tissue! I'm fine-d!
Umm, and looking at people differently.
Okay, good! Okay, what do I want now?
Here you go. You can wear this.
Oh, and the newspaper delivery guy.
Well, no. You're Chandler. Y'know, Chandler!
We're gonna see each other naked.
What? Something happened with the plates?
Hey! How did it go with Elizabeth?
Oh my God! You're water broke!
Oh wow! Okay. Well that was fun.
Aww, thank you. Uh Rach?
So you're free Thursday, then.
Fine. She's wearing my bra!
God, I feel so guilty about Ross.
Boy, do I have a surprise for you!
Oh my God! You still have the Chipper!
I was just waiting for the perfect guy.
Our guy's a great dancer!
Chicken? I could eat some chicken.
No leg-chewing for us sir.
Which one was Pete Carney?
She has to know that your not ready.
Does he not make enough money?
Phoebe, you were supposed to take that back!
Oh, I was hoping you wouldn't remember.
Phoebe, you have to lift it and point.
Really? Let's get past the moment.
What happened in Atlantic City?!
Seriously, what is this supposed to mean?
That you're not funny or sexy?
I just, I can't believe that we made it!
Would it really have been that easy?
Actually, I was gonna do them jullienne.
I just had the most amazing bath.
I'm sorry, but that's my happy place.
Phyllis sees what I'm doing.
I know! I know, I'm so sorry for you!
Ok, well, what kind of ritual?
'Slim Pickings'...That is so cheesy.
A tiny salt shaker!!!
What?! I-I-I don't, I don't do that!
Come here, I want to show you something!
Ross, I'm gonna use yours, okay?
Umm, she Rach, not it, she.
No, you were right. I don't have a plan.
Guys, you got your hair cut.
I guess you have forgotten all about Joey?
Chicken Soup for the Soul?
I sure do! And you don't get one!
Okay, now we just need something borrowed!
I wish all guys could be like him.
You're a pig. And you can't do this.
OK, try this salmon mousse.
I wanna say good-bye at the car!
Y'know, the possible side affects.
I was trying to help out a squirrel.
Well, how bout just her mom?
This doesn't mean anything, does it?
Well, are you just hanging out with Ross?
Careful. Careful. CAREFUL! Sorry.
Ohh. And I don't even have a date.
Y'know what? I'll think you'll play.
What does she mean by 'involved'?
And you know what? We want a rematch.
You were just being so nice to him!
He didn't ask me to marry him.
So, Phoebe runs weird huh?
What kinda things have you been saying?
Oh. I'm sorry it didn't work out.
You can't be a lawyer. You're eight.
Oh dad, really you don't need to...
I hate men! I hate men!
It's just, I'm not good at singing.
I think you're better than you think you are.
Wow Joey, this is, uhh...
I am good. I finished my book.
So, Chandler, who's on your list?
I have some pretty exciting news!
They won't be ready for weeks.
5 6 7 8!
You've got to be smooth about it.
I'm sorry that I borrowed your gloves
Hey, Joey's ass! What are you doing?
Haven't you and I covered that topic?
You got it from Pottery Barn?!
Oh my God, I wrecked your baby!!
Do you not remember the puppet guy?
You are not a freak. You're a guy.
Phyllis is sitting in a chair.
Chandler? Do you promise to be good?
Ohhh, Chandler, sorry! Hey, Janice.
Joey we know you steal our food.
I know, but you have to open it today!
Hey, Joey, could you pass the cheese?
DON'T...be too long with the phone.
We don't, we don't wrestle now.
OK, what're we gonna do about this?
Oh wait! Stop! Stop! Stop!
Okay, if it means that much to you...
That would be the work of a Blowfish.
So the going for help went well?
No he went out to get pizza.
But, I put some honey in it.
This is kind of a classy place.
How would I know? I-I wasn't here.
I had to go with the odds Rach.
Didn't she walk with a cane?
All right, I definitely taste nutmeg.
Is he not cute enough for you?
Joey!! What the hell were you doing?!
Well, it's like that. With feelings.
Right there! That was so fake!
And some of us really have to pee.
Do you always have to bring him here?
I was probably waiting for it to open.
Oh my God!!! What are you doing?!!
Shrill?! The wedding is back on!
So you talked to your dad, huh.
Is that a secret or a lie.
Wouldn't you love to do it just once?!
Promise to call me when you land.
That really was some of your best work.
Chasing him all around the room?
It's in the kitchen, I'll go get it.
Ahh! Aren't you dressed yet?
There it is. Joey, what are you doing?
Helloooo? Yeah. Oh my God. Thanks.
I don't think mine likes me either.
Yeah, but that's pigs not people!
What?! You can't-what did you tell her?
No, you said the baby creeps you out.
Hey Phoebe, will you give me a hand?
She's leaving for three months.
Okay, you're-you're really freaking me out.
God! If you're gonna cry about it!
Is your team winning hon?
I know. Where do you wanna go eat?
Seriously, where did you get the hat?
Honey, we have been through this before!
Well, I just caught the live show.
Yes! You are so smart! I love you.
Stop it, stop it, stop it!
You broke a little girl's leg?!!
You got a callback too didn't you?
I know!!! My erection is back!
Please tell me you're stopping now.
You did? What was he talking about?
Oh nothing I'm just-just was yawning.
How long has it been this time?
Hey, how long are you in the city?
Hi. Do you know what time it is?
Oh! Do you need me to go with you?
Is your tongue swelling up?
Yeah well, I ran into Richard.
We're kidding. C'mon, tell us!
Y'know what?! I gotta go! Ugh!
Wait! Joey! Joey! Are you okay?!
I didn't think you could keep it a secret.
Oh God, you fell off the wagon.
OK, I'll see you later babe.
Ooooh! And-and-and what-what's this?
Okay! My turn! My turn!
Uh, you left out the stupid part.
You went out with Wallis Pincer?
Yeah. Which one do you like more?
Oh, just until the glue dries.
No, we're not! We're not leaving!
Alright, well tell me one of yours.
Making her a mixed tape?
Y'know all my friends think this is weird.
Wait! Wait! This isn't take-out!
Hey! My first review is out!
You didn't tell anybody I was did you?!
No-no. Nothing wrong about that.
Oh good, I hate it when you do that.
You had no right to go out with him.
Alright, well I'm tearing the lettuce.
There you go, enjoy your coffee.
I'll help you fix your sweater.
So Ross, are you gonna bring Mona?
No! Chandler and I are moving in together!
Ohh, you're about to get a little luckier.
That's not true, you don't have a moustache.
Oh, right! I completely forgot about that.
Fine, I'll rub it on myself.
Thank God! I can't watch him anymore!
OK, here you go. Good luck.
Ethan, it's um... it's icky.
No, I called him. It's not gonna happen.
I'm checking out the restaurant with Pete.
About that? Erm...I'm going to change.
Why can't you use the phone in here?
Oh, yay. Ok about that two.
Yes it has! I made cookies!
I don't want things to change! Do you?
Well umm, Alexandra has been...
Don't you want to look through the rest?
Nah... not-not special enough.
Ooh, Ugly Naked Dancing!
You read comic books right?
Whatever you decide, whatever you do.
You didn't even take off your pants.
Me neither! We have to get in!
Honey, you're not pathetic, you're sad.
You can spill. In the sink.
So it's okay to date a student.
Ok. Hey, why don't you ask Richard?
Hey, the man's dog just died.
It doesn't go with any of my stuff.
Ugh! Well, y'know, we were away...
Wait, now, what am I doing again?
Hey everybody! It's Fun Bobby!
Well, you used to like playing the guitar.
And Mindy, your maid of...?
That's different! I was drunk and stupid!
Oh my God! Oh my God! You have to go!
Uh, would you stop it with that already?!
Five more and I'll flash you.
Did you know I was allergic to shellfish?
Phoebe, I thought you said you know what you're doing?
Do you want our guy to be your guy?
Can you go any faster with that?
What are peanut butter fingers?!
The Luisa from home room!
Honey why don't you go lie down.
Nah, he doesn't do anything for me.
A love scene? With who?
No, don't say it! Don't even think it!
Ok everybody, it's time for flan.
What, that little thing at the prom?
Weren't you asked to leave sonny?
Everyone at our school heard it!
You look fabulous honey, you really do.
Sure, what? Ok, ok. Music?
Hi. I'll be ready in just a second.
Joey... we always know what you mean.
Strip Happy Days Game?
Joey, where are the Jell-o shots?
Where you can make out with your assistant.
Oh, then it must've been you. Bye.
They just gonna love you, just be yourself.
Hello? Eighth street deli?
God, look what I found in the drain.
Wow. That is not a happy hi.
Rachel! That was a library card!
Okay. Oh! A coloring book!
Gunther, can I get a coffee to go?
I know, but look at me all tan.
What are you doing here? You can't be here!
Joey, Chandler knows I borrowed the money.
Come in. I've been waiting for you.
Oh yeah, picked a guy, 37135.
You gotta help me out here Pheebs.
You kissed a guy?!! Oh my God.
Oh, Candy! She was so spunky!
Rachel, things can get incredibly complicated.
Really? You promise you won't tell anyone?
Anyway, how did it go with Kate?
Like only if the queen comes?
Did you like learn about her family?
Well, are you going to be able to do this?
Nice! Wow Phoebe you are good!
Why, do you write him a lot?
Oh stop it. Joey already told me.
Yeah, she's here. Hold on a second.
That's ok. I'm sorry I poisoned you.
Just waiting for it to stop bubbling.
I don't know, Chandler. Let's take a look.
Have you even had a girl up here?
: I'm gonna go freshen up ok.
We were just waxing our legs.
Hey, I could've had you if I wanted you.
What-what was it you were gonna tell us?
There are no tickets on the nightstand!
Chandler, you don't believe in soul mates?
Okay, just get a lot better. Fast.
Umm, you've got some on your pants.
What about when I started dating Chandler?
Is there? Is there someone else?
Hello? Hold on. It's your boss.
"Wendy" is a fat girl name.
Do you wanna come in for some lemonade?
All you had to do was buy the card!
Thank you. Just make yourself comfortable.
Well, we could start trying. Now.
Are you gonna dress up as Santa?
Just a minute! That's Mrs. Tribbiani!
I thought you said you were going to do nothing.
We'll discuss it, in the morning!
Demi Moore is not a he.
No, I don't think it ever works. Why?
I can't believe Phoebe's gonna have her babies!
Oh my God! You don't know me at all!
Honey, cover it up with the boat!
Tea gives Phoebe the trots.
Kinda like your Barca lounger.
Rach, why won't they take it back?
Oh. Big family dinner tonight?
Well, actually, I'm already seeing someone.
A kiss? What are you talking about?
So this is it, we're really gonna adopt?
What?!! You cannot tell him that!!
So, I'll get-get back to my friend.
Sorry. So how's it going with Joey?
Okay well I think...that's your answer.
I thought I was something that we both wanted!
Yeah, I know. He can get really competitive.
Come on, we can't let them win!
Well, Ross was mugged as a kid.
Rachel!! Come on! Let me in!
How do you know she's gonna start talking?
Really? I'd say 3 to 4.
It's the heat. And-and the humidity.
Me going out with Richard's son.
Not everybody's happy. Hey Bobby!
Hey, look at you! Where have you been?
We do not have one of those signs.
So ah, Phoebe, how was your date?
Why don't we just find a place for it?
You still want to move in together right?
Rach, are you really gonna let him do this?
Chandler, wh-why don't we sit down?
Do you wanna do it at the same time?
It's enough for wedding scenario eight.
Have you guys picked a date yet?
Okay, come on, do it one more time!
Eh, we weren't that close anyway!
But no. Maybe if I were baking.
I'm sorry, I think that you just misunderstood her.
Oh, I'm sorry. Was that another joke?
You're jealous of Princess Caroline?
Okay. Can you give me a little push?
I'm sorry, I don't understand what you just said.
Okay, okay... Chandler you... you stop it!
Wow! A lipper from Chipper.
Great, now he's waving back.
Yeah! So-so when are you getting married?
Y'know what, I'm gonna hold her head.
Why won't I be married when I'm 40?
We, we just wanna see the end.
Shut up!! It just got interesting!
And they weren't looking at you before?!
I guess they're back from their date.
But I thought if you left, you get fired.
If I tell you, you'll think I'm crazy.
Joke. Joke. Blah! Blah!
I mean, that's a typical guy response.
All right, look I'm just gonna unplug it.
Oh, gosh, you got some on your shirt.
Okay, so Ross will be doing the reading.
Heyyy!! You got the door open!!
I can't answer that! Chandler's my husband.
Because Chandler still has feelings for you!
Who do you wanna fool around with?
Is it okay for me to come in now?
Hang on a second I just got in.
Bye boots-Wait! Half off?!
Why? Do you have a report due?
No, you messed it up. You're stupid.
Oh my God! Have you lost your mind?
Hello, people who do not live here.
Welcome to our side of the tunnel.
Ross, I hated you when we were kids.
Oh, I love my life, I love my life!
Yeah, let-let-let's pretend that's not true.
Yeah! And I got it on sale, too.
Did he just say 'Monica bang'?
All right everybody, this turkey is ready!
Nothing, I just heard something nice about you.
We're-we're really sorry we fogged you.
Who? Two divorces and Joey?!
What makes you think that I might not be okay?
Wow, you're really crazy about her, huh?
Uh-huh, what exactly did you ask her?
So, wait, you really did like my cookies?
He said he's really gonna miss you guys.
Yes but my mom got me this job.
So you're moving in with him. What happened?
Wendy bailed. I have no waitress.
I know. How could we have let this happen?
No-no-no, wait! We need something old!
You can let some of them go by!
Rachel, he like, totally changed time.
And yet, we're still poking him.
You got out of the whole Tulsa thing?
Okay. So, which boxes are mine?
Rach, Phoebe hates Pottery Barn.
Okay everybody, let's go! Let's go!
I can't believe he's that upset about this...
You bet! No TV or anything!
Please, just a little bit off the back.
Wait, now so you joined the gym?
Are you saying that you don't wanna get with this?
Chandler! He's seven; he's not stupid.
So, we're just four losers... SUPER!
What did you do to his sweater vests?
Janice, what umm, what are you doing here?
Rach, you're gonna come though aren't you?
Plus, everyone's gonna see your thing.
Rach, does this have nonfat milk?
I'm sorry that I made you stop seeing him.
Because we won our apartment back!
They really were pretty, weren't they?
Hey, check me out, I'm a slut!
So Chandler, I guess I'll see you at dinner.
Honey? Is that something you're making up?
Wait! You're supposed to wear a costume!
And lucky means, more cleavage?
And yet, here we are doing it again.
Oh, thank you. Would you like a tour?
Oh, how do you play the shadow game?
Shoot, I think I got mayonaise on you.
Hey, come on, Phoebe, you understand don't you?
That's a little more than I wanted to see.
Boy, you are really not a morning person.
There was just one woman, wasn't there?
Okay, knock yourself out, Larry.
No forget it, I'm not gonna tell you now.
I guess Joey was right, it does nothing.
Y'know you're really not supposed to be back here!
Hmm, a little relieved, I gotta say.
Oh, that's what I would do, forget mine.
Can you just hold on for one minute?
Come in! Come in! We're engaged!!!
Thanks. So, I guess I better be going.
Yeah, like you're gonna be pregnant. I mean pregnant.
Say good-bye to sore muscles!
Fair enough, now go get ready!
Have you ever taken out the trash?
That is so funny. Let me see that.
Oh no! You weren't supposed to see this!
I don't believe in soul mates either.
Oh my God! Rachel!! You look terrific!
And the way she slaps all the time!
Okay. Chandler? Can I see you for a second?
You've never met Bob, have you?
Phoebe, she sounded pretty upset to me.
You're right. I'm sorry. I should've told you.
Well we... we kinda broke up.
People! People say it! Come here!
Umm, do you have any uhh, moves?
Ross they're really, really, really white.
Ok fine. I'll handle this. Phoebe?
Yeah, there's one right under the cabinet.
Please! I made this game what it is.
We were shopping, and we had lunch.
I LOVE MY NEW JOB!
I'm parked in a garage on Morton!
Oh God, you are about to get sooo lucky.
That cold makes you sound so great.
Good. What made you change your mind?
Just figured, 'cause you and Ross are...
But then how do we know who wins?
Wait a minute, y'know, you're bringing me!
I'm so sorry. Please, stop freaking out.
Aw, sometimes. Always, actually.
Again. Y'know what? I think we all did.
Home is Home Star stew.
Are you funny? Tell us a joke!
: how do you know I have one of those?
Ross, she's 25 years old.
Well good, here let me help you out.
Looks like he's playin' baseball.
Carol moved her stuff out today.
My God! Is this a gym card?
Oh, god, I am so spoiled... That's it!
Did you eat all the neighbor candy?!
That's right baby! Okay, what do I want now?
yeah oh my god, I'm so moved.
And the fact that they're both monkeys.
Y'know what, you can play with my dollhouse.
You want a problem? I'll give you a problem!
And so, we're hiding in the bathroom.
It-it's so great to see you both here.
Oh good, I'm glad that's catching on.
Cassie needs to stay at your place.
So, you wore your nightie to dinner?
And she wants to go hunting, too!!
He is the man in the black dress.
Oh my God yes! Who is she?
Joey, what are you gonna do when you have a baby?
Chandler, please, come on. Look at him.
So Joey, why didn't you grow a moustache?
Joey, that paper's like a year old!
How many kids were we gonna have?
Chandler has two copies of Annie!
That, you get? That, you get?
Because they'll know we've been listening.
We'll just...we'll just let her stay.
Oh my god, I am losing my mind.
Does anybody wanna split this with me?
You said you loved me! I can't believe this!
No, although now that's what I'm thinking.
Maybe we should just tell your parents first.
Okay, d'y'see anybody you think could be me?
Yes... What is the end of that sentence?
Freemont. West-Westmont, ah Westburg?
GET OUT YOU DUFUS!!
It's okay honey, you'll find a name.
God, I'm sorry! I'll go back and get it!
Well umm, Chandler and I are moving in together.
What the hell is that dog doing here?!
You mean you know Paul like I know Paul?
You made a joke right? So I laughed.
She sent the chicken back again?!
Yeah! Joey has the best boyfriend ever!
Richard buzzed. He's waiting downstairs.
Can you hear me say "You're grounded"?
So what? Don't you have any will power?
Y'know those are a delicacy in India.
Oh yeah! What was his superpower again?
Fun? Fun, you think this is fun?
That's not your regular dry cleaners.
Hey. Call me when you get there. Okay?
Wow! Uh what, did he uh, say?
: But you don't remember sleeping with her.
Umm, listen there's something I think you should know.
Don't you see? It's the perfect crime!
Yes Rachel, why do you care so much?
I can't believe you're not gonna be here for Christmas.
Just be yourself. But, not too much.
Wait-wait, go back to that sibling thing.
He- he pooped in my shoe.
If Phoebe were my maid of honor...
: Ok This is how much I love you.
Umm, I-I really don't want to tell this story.
Where is the James Taylor CD?
If the school finds out you're fired.
Okay! Oh God, y'know what? It's really bad.
Good, they feel good, in my head.
Oh that's an eye removal machine.
Look, I- I could go on pretending-
Oh, well... That had been your window.
They're kissing let's just go around them.
Stop sending food to our apartment.
I knew you were likely to take a wife!
Come on, she'll be here any minute.
Honey, I just don't think that you understood the joke.
Call them mom and dad you loser!
Did the girl ever let you ride it?
But I thought you wanted to live by yourself.
Hey-hey-hey. You wanna hear something that sucks.
Nice try; I'm keeping the boots.
Have you seen Rachel? Or a mirror?
Like asking her to move in with you?
I just can't stand you being here all the time.
Yeah you're right. I don't know what I was thinking.
Yeah-yeah, you remember how I call you bunny?
Is it the same thing that Chandler had?
I mean I-I don't I think I have enough quarters.
All I say is, she better get the job.
All right, all right, at least I'm prepared.
So maybe we should just. . .
I know. It's just such reckless spending.
Well, what made you make the exception for me?
She is unbelievable, our mother is...
It's no big deal, I do it all the time.
Y'know what, let's do the catering business.
Is-is-is there a-a Mrs. Stevens?
Please! I am not as bad as Ross.
Hey, you just got in 5 minutes ago!
These aren't for you! Are you upset?
Yeah huh!! Cover yourself up!
Oh, um, I don't know if that's a good idea.
It's umm, it has something to do with transponding.
Why would the little girl creep you out?
Well I didn't want everyone to think I was stupid.
What? You bet I'd lose a nail?
You know the words! You are so into this!
All right, look at my on the back page.
Only if I don't have to get up and sing.
Ohh, welcome to an adult relationship!
We heard about your pants, I'm so sorry.
It's so unfair, you don't even like your job!
Oh, thank god! Emma, there you are!
No. Not after what happened with Steve.
So then, are you going to dump Jason?
It's out on the island. It's in Massapequa.
My boyfriend really does have good taste!
Okay Phoebe, we should probably go back now.
At least you took me down with you!
Who is also in charge of purchasing.
Rach, try holding her a different way.
Oh my God! Where the hell have you been?!!
Oh my God! He's gonna rat me out!
Awww, come on-wait-stop it. Okay, to Monica.
Hi Dad! I can still call you that right?
You got the job?! Why didn't you tell me?
She's my favorite character on DOOL.
You know what? I-I think I'll wait out here.
This is just Bactine. It won't hurt.
All right, we'll call you when we get back.
I know you do. Me too. So what now?
Only if you say his full name.
Shut up! This place is a hole!
Wow! It's like Rachel in High School.
I don't remember. Do you wanna take a walk?
Let go! I'm a tiny little woman!!
Well I-I really don't remember the name of it.
Oh, so there is gonna be a fifth date?
When, when did-how, how did you...
Okay. Does it have to do with Ross and Rachel?
Hey! How'd your date go with Jake?
Relax. Y'know, she may not even know.
Still, I was quick as a cat.
How crazy that we'd run into you!
Oh, hey! Oh good, you brought food!
So this is what a stroke feels like.
Not one that can pee on the roof.
Yeah could-could-could you get me something to drink?
Umm. Umm. Umm. I don't think so.
Yeah, uh, it's actually not that big a deal.
Hey, Rachel, Can-can I see you for a sec?
Nothing. I don't kn-Umm. I don't know. Umm...
Would you ever be a surrogate for anyone?
I don't know. Maybe we're some kinda magnets.
Have you ever been to one of my weddings?
So we can be friends who sleep together.
Alright. Just keep him away from me.
How are we gonna do that? There's no way.
Noo! I'll stay. He's my brother.
Oh, wait a minute! Who's is the father?!
Oh my God! What were you doing in a library?
Hey, great skirt! Birthday present?
Y'know what, champ? I think I'll pass.
I'm sorry! It wasn't your whole toe!
Harder than it sounds. Isn't it?
Here you go! What do you think about centerpieces?
Making holiday candy for the neighbors.
Can we just start throwing things in?
Ok will do. So glad you came.
My turn? What-what are you talking about?
I don't know how any of these got opened?!
Yeah, apparently, they're pretty good seats.
Do you mind telling us what it is?
You have scratches all over you, what happened?
We are talking about Rachel here. You and Rachel.
No, only because that's the graduation song.
So umm, how was your date with Ginger?
: Eww are you talking about my bother.
But you've only slept with two people.
Yes Phoebe, but this is all I have. Okay?
I might've said that. Why is that funny?
Ok, how about pilgrim Mockolate mousse?
What about the part where he has rabies?
So, um, how-how did you guys meet?
So basically, this is a getting-rid-of-everything-Rachel-ever-used sale.
No because it-it didn't seem important.
See ya.... Waitwait, what's with you?
Sure, we have no money, go ahead.
Got the keys? or Got the keys!
This is Chandler's chicken. This is the turkey.
Okay, look, this could be a really long game.
People are supposed to wanna hang out here!
Do you really want to pull at that thread?
It's okay. I don't care. It's uh, it's fine.
How much did ever really win before?
Yeah, a lot. A lot, a lot!
Then get over yourself! Grow up!
Oh, George, baby, drop the towel!
Shut up, and put my table back.
Because she's not gonna get to keep the babies.
No. I can't be away from you for that long.
What?! There's only been like four kids.
Rachel is not going to pick your stupid guy.
What happened to Santa, Holiday Armadillo?
You faked it? You couldn't have faked it!
What about these? These look the same?
It was Michelle. It was definitely Michelle.
Hi. Richard just told me he loves me.
There is no alley behind Macy's.
Is it something you'd be interested in?
Chandler, you have to tell Joey that you're not in Tulsa.
Hey, you think, you can keep it another night?
So, you think you'll do it on his couch?
Well, I think I shouldn't look directly at them.
All the time. In fact, I was undefeated.
I've gotta tell you, Bob is terrific.
I can't believe you guys are actually getting tattoos.
That's right, because I forbid you to smoke again.
Ross, you've got to do something about the humping.
Look at you, you won't even look at him.
Shhh! We just got her to go to sleep.
Is that some kind of boat talk?
Joey just hired Chandler to be his assistant!
Chandler stole a twenty from my purse!
Well I don't have them either. Where are they?
She looks exactly like Aunt Marilyn.
Ross, if you don't tell them, then I will!
Why? 'Cause otherwise you'd go for it?
Heads up Ross! Score! You suck!
How many fingers am I holding up?
Wow, those pills really worked, huh?
Chandler! Chandler! I just figured out who you are!
I hear ya. Excuse me for just a second!
People have got to finish their stories!
Oh my God, ice just got in my eye!
How did it go with Frank and Alice?
So are you ever gonna tell whoever it is?
Well, I thought that I would cut up the tomatos.
Hey Rach, aren't these candlesticks mine?
No Joey, I think he's just watchin' TV.
Hey! What did you decide to do about the movie?
Check your numbers! Make me rich!
I'm sorry I almost made you sleep with Ross.
You gave my father a lap dance!
Oh good, Lenny and Squigy are here.
No. But I remember people telling me about it.
Uhh, not much. Uh, work's good.
I guess I wanted to keep it as a souvenir.
Oh, my fiancee wants the Swing Kings.
Because I don't work at the Szechwan Dragon.
So, do you want me to watch Ben for you?
I'm dicing, I'm dicing, I don't hear anything.
I can do it, okay? Come on, let's go.
Well, that's it You gonna crash on the couch?
Is he crazy?! You just had Ross's baby!
A monkey. Have you seen a monkey?
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.
No! But I know exactly what I'm going to say.
Dad, Chandler was just laughing at your joke.
Listen, I... I don't think this is the best time.
Yes it is! You saw me wearing it!
Yeah, I saw him waiting for an elevator.
So you gave in and decided to call someone?
Noooo! I'm lying. I am so drunk.
Okay! Okay! Make me sterile, but okay.
Oh, no thanks, we're just here to observe.
And! We also have speaker phone.
Right now, Joey and Chandler's, go now.
Well at least, I'm going to mute it.
Wow, do you mean like kiss him-kiss him?
I'm sorry, Joey. I'm gonna go to bed, guys.
Okay, where is the Kat Stevens CD?
yep, that's me, I am that stupid .
Damnit Phoebe! How did you even call him?
I swear, if you try it, you will love it!
You can not play bagpipes at the wedding!!
Well, not... worried, just... wondering.
Well, go over to her! She's not with anyone.
Hey, Joey, what would you do if you were omnipotent?
I promise you, he would definitely want you back.
Awww, just like you always wanted. Congratulations
Do you want to go out on a date with her?
Honey you-you got to beat your scores!
That's it! Right there! Is all I wanted!
All I have is, is oregano and a Fresca.
Let's see, today's Monday... Never.
Could've played Monopoly, but nooooo.
Thank you. My hair is very amused.
Oh yes! I have it right here, on ice!
Hey, we're probably fertile, let's go home!
Oh, y'know what, I can't, it really kills.
Okay, don't miss that flight. You know I love you.
Are you serious? You still see Dr. Gettleman?
How about a Youhoo with a funny straw?
..I dunno, a little too Alan?
Didn't your dad used to call you Pumpkin?
Hey, Rachel, isn't that stuff almost pure...
Can you believe he just offered me a restaurant?
Richard's living room, drinking wine.
He was so good in that movie of MacBeth.
Well, high school was not my favourite time.
Very good! What do you need it for anyway?
Ross! He's playing with my spatulas again!
Oh gosh, Phoebe, I think I caught your cold.
Hey, don't blame me for wigging tonight!
Oh, sweetie. Oh, look at you. You're shivering.
Oh my God! Fog him! Fog him!
Oh please, you just want more blue pins.
Yes, I would like something. No, no thank you.
Has somebody been drinking my fat?
Joey, this is for you. It's blackberry curin.
Or! A bakery delivery person.
Oh, it is sooo perfect. Thank you so much.
Bet I know how that discussion's going to go.
Oh look, and he did my crossword puzzle.
We could, or we can have sex in it.
But, we pick again! We pick again!
Oh. Well did you get it? Let me see.
Oh God, maybe he won't see us. Richard!
I'm sick of Japanese. We're not going there.
No, I'll do it. You just stick to your job.
Okay, look at this one. This is my favourite.
Y'know, I try to stay positive. . .
A hat! Yes! We need a hat.
Uh, Rach, it's the Visa card people.
Yes you did! You did like a little hop.
That'll teach you to lick my muffin.
I knew that! Rachel! Use you're head!
No, I-I haven't seen your pink shirt.
Oh, are the drapes still closed hon?
Ohh, everybody at the restaurant still hates me.
Blow drying what, you have no hair.
Oh yeah...So how did you end up kissing?
: you don't think sharks are sexy do you?
Oh, would you let it go already?! You're fine!
I'm sorry, why is this girl going to call me?
Look, you and I went to different high schools...
Hey, it was very moving! You're just heartless!
Phoebe, why is there a dog in our apartment?
Nice to meet you! My God you're great!
Do you really see this as a long-term thing?
If you're not going then I don't want to go either.
I know the code to his answering machine.
Well, usually when I'm this anxious, I clean!
Yeah, hi, it's Monica. I just got a page.
Okay. Well, it's good news. It's good news.
I have not been sick in over three years!
I don't know, I lost it all ok. I lost it.
OK, if you say stop, then we stop.
Why, what's wrong with my bathroom floor?
You're not gonna believe this. Okay, so I go over...
Oh no, was I cleaning in my sleep again?
There's an ad for a naked chef?
Phoebe, we are so proud of you! You're amazing!
Hey wait a minute, this one isn't dirty.
And I'm a wuss. And we should be partners.
Well, it just seems like a really small number.
Yeah. I hope she can kick his ass.
Oh my god, honey, I'm so so so so so sorry.
Oh no! Did you take my bra too?!
Rach, there's something uh, important I have to tell you.
Wait a minute. I thought last night was great.
When it's your assistant, I would say never.
I'm just so excited to make the presents! Shoot!
Okay. Okay, I'm ready. Come on big fella!
Oh, you're totally welcome! What'd she say?
Ethan, focus. How could you not tell me?
I'm still not done not wanting to talk to you.
What?! I just touched him and he went over.
Base Unit! Think Monica! Think!
I'm really getting tired of sneaking around.
Oh, look at those little fingers and toes!
Hey, at least I knew where my guy was.
You know, the guys are probably having a great time.
Well, we're still talking about it, aren't we?
What, what are you doing? You can't go out there.
Still get a discount on wedding dresses?
You are insane! You-you gotta give this up!
You're not gonna be here New Year's Eve??
All right. Honey, that's-that's a sleeve. Okay?
I think somebody needs another lap dance.
Hey, we can take her back with you if you want.
Oh, okay. Here, why don't you let me do it?
I didn't say your songs were not good enough.
Chandler, I don't even wanna see the musical Oklahoma!
Phoebe, he's gotta be in the room for that to work.
Great. So the ball is in his court?
How do you know exactly what she's going through?
My boyfriend said he didn't like my massages.
So we're gonna try? I mean, are we trying?
Phoebe, you have a, a twig in your hair.
Oh. Oh yeah! Ohhhhh! Ohh! Oh yeah!
Well y'know Joey, you're a pretty charming guy.
Oh, please, that is such a lame excuse!
Yes you did. You absolutely sold me...
I wanted it so bad! Wanna go pack?
Well, tonight was-was going to be my first time.
You know, that guy she met at the coffeehouse.
I've been great, just great. How have you been?
Great. It's gym class all over again.
Hey Chandler! Did you like the macaroni and cheese?
When Rachel was with Paulo, what did you do?
Oh, thanks! We'll try to stop by.
Well, the giraffe's okay. And so is the pirate.
Hey! Maybe the monkey will be at the audition!
Oh Soap Opera Digest award!
Sure, we'll do that. What are you up to?
Oh, right, right. How was your date, 'Chand-lrr'?
Sure, every time, you're such a princess...
I don't want him to think that I'm having an affair.
Then, I'd steer clear of Phoebe.
Pick a number! That is your only job!
You-you're gonna have to put your foot down?
Ross, when's this comet thing start?
What? Are you serious?! Joey smells gas!
Man, I feel like I'm coming down with something.
Chandler, would you like some more orange juice?
OK, how does everybody like their burgers?
Is this the one that I threw out last year?
If you tell me, I'll tell you what Phoebe said.
Okay, stop it Phoebe, you're getting me all tingly.
Now I love you. And not just 'cause I have to.
The park huh? A public place.
What are you guys doing? Oh my God, is that Richard?
Roger wants to take her out tomorrow night.
Ooh, chocolates on the pillows! I love that!
What do you have against the beautiful guest room?
Well I'm Monica Geller, ball like a baby.
Look at you! Come here! Feel better?
All right, Phoebe get open. Rachel, go long.
I don't know. I don't know. It's just going to be so great!
Come here. I can breath through my mouth.
That's true! I knew I married you for a reason!
You wanna be in charge of the food committee?
I mean think about all the money that you're gonna make!
We took a cab. Did you guys walk?
Ok, it is definitely less than a ballpark.
No, I want everything you just said. I want a marriage.
Monica and I just crashed an embassy party.
Look, I wanted to tell I'm-I'm sorry you lost.
I can cook and you can take care of the money.
We don't do that! Tell her we don't do that!
Have I read it? No, are you enjoying it?
Any woman would be lucky to have ya.
How does that laugh not give you a headache?
That's right, she came back all by herself.
Ohhh, ooohhh... you are on a roll, mister!
No, not if their room has two beds!
Hey, it's Funny's cousin, Not Funny.
We're really glad you decided to meet our guy.
Ooh, candy bars, crossword puzzles...
So! I'm just an empty vase, huh?
Is it better than the other salmon mousse?
Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't do this.
Okay, let's go!! Let's hit the road!!
Ross! The neighbors ate all my candy!!
Four, please. I'm really nervous. Thank you.
Well, then, I'm okay with being high maintenance.
Chandler one time wore my underwear to work!
Oh my God! That's my restaurant, I'm the chef there.
Yeah, two hours, a lifetime that's the same.
Yeah, but y'know we could sneak in and watch.
Ross, your little creatures got the remote again.
Oh, oh, okay umm, so I'll see you soon.
: Yes! Chandler Watches Shark Porn!
I-I already told him everything! You shush!!
It will not be fine. We'll get in trouble.
Oh umm, I meant to tell you, Ross is coming.
Because I put my head between her legs.
What? So now I'm not allowed to fire him?
Because! You could get to live out my fantasy!
Ross, you did not come up with "got milk?"
Yeah, I think I have some around here somewhere. Why?
Would you look at her? She is so peaceful.
How 'bout one last game of racquetball?
Huh. What's doofus spelled backwards?
Phoebe! You kinda caught me at a bad time.
You only think it's stupid because you suck at it.
Joey...he's not even thinking about going after Rachel!
Uhh, y'know actually I was gonna do some laundry.
Of course! Joey wouldn't let you have one?
All right, come on, I'm-I'm late for work!
Phoebe, there's a dog sitting on my couch!
Hey! Didn't you have that outfit on last night?
All weekend? That's a whole lotta naked.
No I didn't. I asked, "got the ke-eys?"
He hates me. My nephew hates me.
Guys. I thought you were taking Ross to the game?
That's it! Take it! Take it! Take it!
What if something gets broken, they're so expensive.
Oh my God, Joey, that is such a great tip.
So you stole that tape from Richard's apartment?
Well, what kind of food is he looking for?
Oh my god, where's Emma? Where's Emma?
Ross, how long have you been planning this wedding?
Ok, three kinds of potatoes coming up.
Nothing. I just want the baby to be born today.
"To take you to his mansion in the sky-y?"
No... Either of you girls got a quarter?
Michael Flatley, Lord of the Dance!
Oh, Janine, the really hot dancer girl?
Rachel, it's a world where Joey is a neuro-surgeon.
Yeah you will! And, are you kiddin' me?!
It's all everybody at the party could talk about!
Hey! Umm, I think Brenda needs a raise.
Wow! I can't believe I actually rolled an eight.
Who cares? He works in a museum!
Fantastic! I have one question: How is that possible?
Hello? Hold on please. Joey, it's your mom.
The wedding is off, sloppy and immature!
Yeah! And the winner gets a hundred bucks.
Okay, umm, okay, umm... It's just Joey and Ross.
Wow, the boyfriend's parents! That's a big step.
Why? Do you think he's still mad at us?
My parents spent the money for our wedding!
It's a traditional Mexican custard dessert.
Is he right? Am I really-Am I awful?
Danny. Are you guys ever gonna go out again?
Stop with the broom, we're not making noise.
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god!
I don't think you'll ever get my parents that drunk!
Whose little ball of paper is this?!
So what. So he drank a lot tonight.
He's in the bathroom. I don't think you wanna go in there!
O-kay, so you wanna play it that way, do you?
I think I'll help her out. What is going on here?
Umm, okay. If it's a boy it's Daniel.
Change! Okay, sit down. Two seconds.
That's also like the tenth time you told us.
Oh, wait, is he the guy I met at Christmas?
Boy, that was-that was, umm... terrific.
That's different, we were roommates! And when?!
Oh God, is it 6:30? Buzz him in!
Child-birth, it's a natural thing! It's beautiful.
: I cannot tell you how happy that makes me!
Oh really? When? Do you wanna do it with me?
What is wrong with this freezer?! Ow! Ow!!
Where are we gonna find a tiny little hat?
I think that is so great! When are you gonna ask her?
It's a globe and, a pencil sharpener.
I know you're planning my surprise bridal shower.
No-no, Rachel, don't get it! He can't see us!
I mean, my feelings for Richard are certainly gone.
Ya know, you had no right to go out with him.
Okay. So what do you.... you think she's faking?
Oh wait, Joey, you can't go like that! You stink!
Oh, my mother's right. I'm never going to get married.
Oh good God, Ross! How the hell do you do it?
Nothing, um, it's just, um... It's Roger.
No! Joey, we swore we'd never tell!
No!! You have been screwing us all day!
Gary's gonna ask you to move in with him!!
Yes I did, I'm Monica, Super Aunt.
Phoebe, why is smoke coming out of the bathroom?!
I hadn't! Photo 152 was a prototype.
Those are my eyes! Those are my breasts.
We'd be eating our soup right now.
Un, no you didn't! You must be mistaken!
Well if you want a problem? I'll give you a problem!
Okay. Let us start with the A's. Advertising.
I cannot believe you broke up with her just like that.
You should go to the game. It's okay. I want you to.
You know that? You don't want to spoil your appetite.
Oh, I was thinking about having people over for the game.
I'm sorry, I'm just excited about being an aunt!
Oh, about that. Joey, you have to change before the party.
Yeah, I don't hear Chandler's and he doesn't hear mine.
Sush!! I cannot believe she is still up there.
Ross you know that tonight is your date with Hillary?
Hey. There you are. You disappeared after dinner.
It's okay. Chandler, are you afraid of me or something?
Yeah you're right, we can't-we shouldn't watch this.
All right boys, last chance for the tickets!
The truth is, Dad, we're-we're trying.
You got a present for my parents. That's so sweet.
Wait a minute! My last Kit-Kat bar!
Remember it? What do you think this is, a freckle?
Don't worry about it Phoebe, we'll absolutely do it.
Yeah, yeah, and you were going him y'know, your flower.
Fresh cookies! Hot from the oven!
Oh my God! How cute is the on-call doctor?
Oh no, two days, you must be bummed.
Oh no, she's out having drinks with Carl.
Yeah, but I'm the only one related by blood.
All right, get your coat, we're going to the hospital.
My God, you can't even look at me! Can you?
So guys, listen, I go over there, and umm...
I would do it but she thinks I'm attracted to her!
You jerk! You know how much I love that kid!
You know, it still smells like monkey in there.
Sounds like she's got the ah, whole package.
Look. Joey, do you know we can see you from here?
Oh. Monica! ...Hi. I'm Mo- ...nana.
Besides, it takes the focus off the hat.
BECAUSE OF OUR MEDDLING! Alright?
Eh... Heart Disease, Alzheimers, gout?
Alright. I'm gonna go change, I've got a date.
Yo, Bing. Racquetball in 15 minutes.
Well, unless goose is a vegetable...ha haaaah!
Honey, I'm going to put my hand in your pocket!
...horribly attractive. I'll be shutting up now.
You'd better hope I don't see you in the hallway!!
Oh damn the jellyfish. Damn all the jellyfish!
Well, her father pays you for baby-sitting right?
Damnit Ross, get your butt out of the bathroom.
Hey, I've come to terms with it, you have to too.
What-what are you doing? Is this supposed to be funny?
That's the nicest anyone has ever said to me!
Ooh, are we allowed to lie in the vows?!
Oh yeah, like I'm going to let you talk to the queen.
Get up. Come on. Let's get some coffee.
Let's see, 1939... yeah, 24, 25?
Phoebe, c'mere. I want to show you something in the bathroom.
Rache, I think we have enough regular lamps.
How did you know that?! Joey! Chandler!! It's time!
No, I want everything that you just said. I want a marriage.
I'm Monica Geller. I've been taking care of you.
Awww, look at Aunt Monica's little boy!
It sure is nice to do this together, isn't it?
Hey Rach, could you get me some cough drops?
I want you to know, it wasn't me who turned you in.
You've got to get back out there, it's your party.
: Im very, very drunk right now.
Well there's some people who do want to marry me.
I wanna wake up early and go get it for you!
Not a lot, Phoebe's kidding, Phoebe's crazy.
You know what? I'm not gonna be able to enjoy this.
Wait a minute, I can get ice at the restaurant...
No! We're gonna have fun. We can make fudge!
Well, I guess we won't be warming his house.
You know what. Tomorrow I'm gonna do your clocks.
Yes, they are. The Blymens invited them.
Y'know what? You're right Phoebe. You're right. Thank you!
I hope you cleaned your hair out of the drain.
No. You know, sometimes just things doesn't work out.
Wow! I'm-I'm-I'm glad you smashed her watch!
You're getting a crush on your sister's fiance.
No! We only mess around at his place!
Well, if you wanna get a drink later we can.
It's your suitcase. We're going to Las Vegas.
Joey, I thought you were gonna try to be friends first!
Well it clearly wasn't showering or shaving.
Y'know what? I-I don't want a big, fancy wedding.
I love the "I forgot the present" fake out!
Well forget it! It doesn't hurt that baaad!!!!
What are you talking about? We're all together right now.
Oh that's great, why don't you tell mommy on me.
No, Rachel never pees in public restrooms.
Why are you talking about volcanoes all of the sudden?
Sweetie, we heard you crying. Please don't cry.
All right, then show me some manly moves.
Okay! There you go! It's two tickets to Vegas!
Oh, I'm totally crazy, but you-you like the food?
Joey! He's working! You would look good in that.
Alright, Cincinnati, no blinds, everybody ante.
We're supposed to meet my parents in 15 minutes.
Y'know, Joey, I think it's time to give up the bag.
Wow, he's really not letting this go, is he?
Yeah! That's why I'm sleeping with him on the side.
Yeah. You're just gonna have to stop pissing me off.
Did he give you that whole "You're-not-up-to-this" thing again?
Here you go, maybe this'll cheer you up.
This is the most special day of our lives.
It just makes more sense as an ensemble.
I know! I'll tell you something, we are gonna do that again!
Hey, are you ready to get back on the dance floor?
Oh I can't. Dr. Roger is coming over again.
Chandler, do you think we talk about our relationship enough?
Then why the hell are you dumping my brother?!?
Okay, so you were trying to play bad this whole time.
Yes! Why, did you-you forget to make yours?
Because Armadillos also wandered in the desert?
Yeah, I couldn't be mad at him for too long.
Would you let it go? It's not that big a deal.
Six? I just had it for one night. It's three.
Chandler, that's like your fourth cup of coffee!
...I think he deserves a Nobel Prize.
Okay. God well, we gotta go back and get them!
I promise you, next time I will absolutely tell you.
See yeah umm, you kinda stole my thunder!
The game's over! Take off your robe!
I feel really sad that we're not...really there anymore.
Oh I love taking limos when nobody died!
How can I not do it? I have $127 in the bank.
Did you ever, uh, like, think about the future?
So, why don't you just take it back to where you got it?
Y'know she has 147,000 pairs of boots...
Oh, just so you know, you-you have to let him win.
Y'know, I love doing crossword puzzles with you honey!
Oh yeah, of course. I'm fine it's just that-
Hey, did you guys know, that your oven doesn't work?
Quick, Phoebe, tell us before he can swallow.
Ok, then, why are you... all dressed up??
You bought the beach house when I was 23!
Hey Phoebe... how you doin'? You feelin' better?
Uch. I am still so mad at you for smoking.
It's okay! It's good! It's good. It's a disease!
You go girl. I can't pull that off can I?
That's not true, there are great pictures of us!
Because Phoebe and Gary are in that-can't-keep-their-hands-off-each-other-doing-it-in-the-park phase!
Look Julio, someone left their book here.
Hold on a second! What is that on her ankle?
Oh that's a great idea. You're really good on the phone.
I-I'm the head chef. I-I can't get promoted.
No, I think that this is what you wanna do, I think it's great!
Yeah, well you promised Barry, you'd marry him.
Yeah. Rach, are you thinking you're gonna make it to Vail?
I don't want her to get a boob job! That's crazy!
Wow. Oh wow. You know I love you too, right.
I can't believe mom and dad are selling the house!
No you learn these things. You grow into it.
Damnit! Damnit!! Here's your fifty bucks!
Oh-oh, no no don't worry, I'm gonna wash it.
Whatever keeps you off the balcony, big guy!
Oh Will. But you-you've worked so hard...
Well... of course I thought of you! But... but...
Oh my God. You're even dumber than I am!
Hmm, I don't know. We really have to talk this through.
You don't have a car. And your license expired.
I just told Rachel that Roy touched my boob.
It's some of Richard's hair! What do I do with this?
You know, it's a really funny story how this happened.
All right, that's it, we're going to the emergency room.
Joey, why don't you put them in the lost and found?
You broke up with a girl because she was fat?!
Yeah, Chandler... you've been there for five years.
Pete! Pete!! That guy's pretty huge!
Well, it's a set and they should probably stay together.
I can't believe her, y'know it's just-it's so typical.
So are you thinking of starting up something with this guy?
Not that bad? Did you hear the hammer story?
Rachel, you say you're sorry or your sweater gets it.
All right! You and me! Let's go! Right now!
Oh, that is so sweet. Oh gosh, love you. Insurance?
You said your boss wants to buy your baby?!
Alright, you know what? That's it. You've had your chance.
Guys, you're a few steps ahead of us.
Was he wearing a stunning blue suit?
No! Rachel, you didn't find anyone so you can't tell him.
Ditch you? Phoebe, you were pregnant with the triplets!
Hey Frannie, welcome back! How was Florida?
Guys, please, I'm just gonna have dinner with him. Okay?
I meant, why don't you take Richard to the game? What?
Rachel, it's going to happen. Chandler is gonna move in here.
I can't believe this is taking so long. How are you doing?
I know! Phoebe is gonna love dressing them in these!
Oh yeah? Ok, let's settle this, come on!
Dad, it is not. What's with the red light?
Don't get too attached, she's having it cremated.
Chinese menu guy. Forgot the menus.
I'm in love too! But in an orderly fashion.
Here, let me make the milk, I'm up anyway.
Y'know, maybe it's best that we never got to do it again.
I know, how can you not be accross the hall anymore.
No Mom, I don't have a restaurant, I work in a restaurant.
How about we play for more money, say 150?
Look, I am not high maintenance. I am not. Chandler!
I've never loved anybody as much as I love you.
He probably wants you back because you're right for the job.
You're really sticking with the shell necklace huh?
Hey, how are you feelin'? Any morning sickness?
Limited seating?! I am just one tiny person!
Well, that was weird. You were loud, and I was fast.
See, now this is why I keep notepads everywhere.
Rachel, listen to your mother. She is very smart.
C'mon give me five more. Five more.
No! You are not gonna run out and leave her here!
Oh my God, what would have done if I said yes?
'Cause I don't want to encourage this kind of behaviour.
They tore it down a few days early.
All right, just trying to start an interesting discussion.
Ohh, I'm sorry I couldn't think of anymore for Ross!
And what are you laughing at, Miss `My-keg-sucking-boyfriend-is-stealing-from-me!'
Honey, the question is...do you really want to marry Joey?
Why does my cinamon stick have an eraser?
So, uh, have you ever thought about being there for her?
I don't know exactly. It's-it's sorta like wrestling.
Doing great, the quiches are coming along.
Oh my God, what a fun day! That sounds great!
Y'know they say a watched pot never beeps.
Chandler! He's your father; he should be at the wedding.
Ok, there's enthusiastic and there's just plain gay!!
Ah-ah-ah, now you started this, you will finish it.
Y'know, there's a Starbucks about three blocks down.
I gotta tell ya, I think it's okay to be that guy.
Well Joey, we're all...we're all very proud of you.
He's in a different room! He's really that loud?
All right, I've heard enough. I've made my decision.
Uh well that depends, how are things with Phoebe?
Chris says they're closing down the bar.
I don't know. I guess the other people just don't care enough.
He's seeing someone. I can't believe he's seeing someone.
Are, are you okay? I mean, do you want me to stay?
So, we did okay at the strip club, right?
Yeah! Hey! Thanks for getting me that girl's number.
Oh that's too bad. It's true, but too bad.
...Oh! I-I see you moved the green ottoman.
Wow! Imagine what our kids would look like!
Oh, and you know who's selling a great apartment? Richard!
She's right...of course not. Honey, get the tape.
I don't know what to say. We shouldn't have lied to you.
Oh, relinquish is just a fancy word for lose!
Hey, Rach, can you give me a hand with this box?
Phoebe and Gary are so gonna hear about this at dinner.
Rachel! Rachel! You haven't touched Eldad's hair!
Excuse me? He doesn't even know what he's doing!
Oh she misunderstood, she thought she was moving to Tulsa.
Rach, I know her pretty well, can I go? That's fine.
You remember that video I found of mom and dad?
I can't believe it's raining again! Oh, it's so unfair!!!
Nothing. I just think it's nice when we're all here together.
I have no idea. But look how much they spent!
No, but he told me, he thinks your a fox.
No reason. I-I keep private things in there.
Just double checking ...no, no, no... No!
I can not see him? I mean, you can't tell me what to do!
Hey Hon, could you help me get the plates down?
Oh good! 'Cause where else would we get any?
But why?! Did he get in touch with Emily?
Oh, come on it's my wedding! That can be my present.
Hey, cheer up! You're gonna see her again, right?
Well, if you want, you can stay with Rachel and me tonight.
Well, you-you coulda just turned the cushion over.
Okay then, I don't stink. I'm a good chef. Okay.
Joey, take your time with that. That's my last batch.
All right then, your bra would still be big.
Wait Chandler come on, let's-it's not a big deal!
Okay, here's your milk. What do you want to talk about?
You are so cute! How did you get to be so cute?
Hey, where are all my ovulation-sticks? There's only one here.
Ross hasn't worked at the museum for a year!
What? I-I bought groceries, I was gonna make you dinner!
Bobby and I are going away for the weekend, remember?
Sweetie! Edges! Fingers! Smudgey! Pictures!
Oh, so you finally took it out of the marina huh?
Oh. Well then way to go you big movie star!
That kid really kicked me hard on the plane.
That's a good idea! Wait, do you know how to waiter?
Listen Rachel, I feel really bad about-What are you doing?
Yeah, but if it's good news, you should tell him now.
You and Mona are doing a holiday card together?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, where are we on the hundred bucks?
Thank you. Rachel, can I talk to you outside for a sec?
You're still so funny. You're so funny. What do I do?
Yes, but you cannot tell anyone! No one knows!
Easy Rach, we'll find it. Won't we!
Yeah. Umm, Chandler can I talk to you outside for a second?
Alright that's great, then just go. Go Knicks.
Wow! I Had no idea you had this much pride.
It's unbelievable! I-I can't believe that sign didn't work!
We forgot to sign one of the admissions forms.
Shut up, the camera adds ten pounds.
Well, no. But, um, I bet she probably does.
Okay! But you can't rip it. Well, maybe a little.
All right, biggest suite in the place. Come on!
I kind of have to don't I? Because of this stupid thing.
Okay. I can do that. I gotta go powder my ass.
She was like 30, dark hair, attractive.
I got offered the head chef job at Allesandro's.
There's nothing we can do. You erased the message!
Yeah. And y'know, if you wanna cry, that's okay too.
Why don't I just take off my clothes and have a nightmare.
Not just the phone pen. I never get my messages.
First, I need a boyfriend, then I can have a list.
To score the winning touchdown, by the way.
All right umm, a string quartet for the procession.
This is amazing. I mean, how, how did this happen?
I know... it's just... I thought this was, you know... it.
Where are you guys going? Come on, one more game!
Relax, she-she's gonna give in way before you do!
Yeah, I've had them picked out since I was fourteen.
Is that, is that what they call strippers sometimes?
No Phoebe, those are like the side affects and stuff.
Whoa whoa whoa! Where're you goin'?
So? How did it go with Joshua last night?
Do you still wanna call 'em? I wanna call 'em.
I can't believe you're gonna have sex on my engagement night!!
This is what happens when you don't register for gifts!
Wow, she must have hurt you pretty bad, huh?
How can you not remember? You made us call you...Bea.
When you get a sec, another round of daiquiris.
I can't believe this! This is like the worst night ever!
Oh well, maybe we can put it in the guest bedroom.
So is it horrible? Is everybody working really hard?
So you're gonna be gone four days a week? No.
Oh, Joey, please tell me you're only donating your time.
Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please?
This is so great! And I'm gonna be your baby's aunt!
Do not start without me. Do not start without me.
Ok, hypothetically, why won't I be married when I'm 40?
Joey! Why is Janine not coming over for dinner?!
Of course not nothing is. Between me and you...
My dad told me. They play golf together.
I'm also thinking about opening up my own restaurant.
He's not gonna say anything, because we're not gonna tell him.
It needs to go about 20 blocks to the left!
Well, sure, what with it being her funeral and all.
Wow! So, now you're going on a date with this girl?
Now, these are-are more realistic, but perishable.
No honey, I'm sorry, but the weekend's not over yet.
Phoebe why don't you just call her? You obviously want to.
Wendy? -- That sounds like a girl's name.
One hour? You are such a leaf blower.
Thank you. Come meet my friends. This is uh, Phoebe.
No! Steady as a rock! Now, are you with me.
Ok, Mr. Heckles, we'll try to keep it down.
You bet your ass, I'm gonna fire you! Thank you.
It sounds like it's coming from across the street.
Honey, listen... You have nothing to worry about with Geoffrey.
You don't have to stick up for her. She can't here you.
Okay, I got my note cards. Do you got the presents?
Relax, Ross. She's not made of ice cream!
Chandler! You don't have to ask for my permission. You can go.
Oh that's right, that's what I'd sound like if I exploded.
Oh really? Okay, let's compare, shall we.
I'm quitting!! Woo-hoo! I'm okay!! I'm all right!!
Count in our heads as-as good Madlibs.
No, it's not a sign! It's a very old key!
Who did we fight in World War I?
So maybe they could umm, call the award the Monica?
Wait a minute, they're making you take time off work?
Hey-hey, how goes the dancing? Gay yet?
Yeah. We-we had sex and then we fell asleep.
Wow! Your lip went bald. Hey, thanks.
Are you gonna break up with me if I get fat again?
And I suppose you used a ring designer for that.
No it's not! You want it, you're gonna have to win it!
Nobody wants to do it? All right, I'll do it myself.
Is he doing his shark attack bit yet?
Oh, when you get over this breakup we need to go shopping.
Hi! Hey, Pete you're back! Hey, check this out.
'....Won't you, won't you, won't you.... '
But it didn't. Say hello to Mrs. Chatracus.
Oh, of course, it's so nice to see you again, Zack!
Close? She's got her tongue in his ear.
Can I ask you just a little question, huh? Why tonight?
That could be a four or a five. It's your call.
What are you doing?! Chandler! You can't just go back a phase!
Oh God, oh God, I am sorry... I am so sorry...
Uh, Aunt Iris? This is Phoebe, and that's Rachel...
If you really want to watch that Serengetti thing, you can.
Why? It's not like I'm putting little nipples on them.
I'd like a scotch on the rocks with a twist.
Okay, Joey's gonna catch it, and you and I are gonna block.
Honey, you're just in time, I'm about to sing another song!
That's sounds great, but how are you going to afford it?
No, I have just to have two more points to beat him!
Come on, was it somebody maybe you dated in college?
So Don, what-what other restaurants do you like?
Well, we-we had to go back because I forget my jacket.
I can't just walk away! I've put in four hours!
Hey, guys. I'm here to pick out my Christmas tree.
All right, half the people. I mean, just try it and see.
It's Chandler's way of pretending he didn't take mime.
Why would someone do that?! ...One might wonder.
Ohh, you are such a good boss! Is she pretty?
It is going to be okay! It was worth a shot.
We're really sorry, but um, she did ask us first.
Don't worry. You'll find some place to get married.
Why are you reading this? You hate this kind of stuff.
Well, I love it. I only hope my wedding looks this good.
A small puff of air, now come on!
Oh Joey, Melanie called, said she's gonna be late.
Ok, thanks for coming, I hope you guys had fun.
Do you guys know what happened to Chandler's barca lounger?
Don't feel bad for me! I won like every time!
Ross, is he gonna live with you, like, in your apartment?
So, how about you huh? How do you know the happy couple?
Calling Dr. Big, Dr. Big to the bed.
Please. Half the guys out there have makeup on.
Man, I knew it! I knew you were going to do this!!
You're-you're-you're gonna bring the Barca Lounger over here?
Oh, can I borrow this? My milk's gone bad.
Why do you guys have so many keys in there anyway?
Awww, y'know what your nickname is, Mr. Big...
No, but that's probably 'cause I haven't asked them yet.
Do you really think marrying someone else is the right answer?
Oh yeah that's what you want - my inhibitions lowered.
Hey, we could have used that kind of thinkin' earlier.
All right, I still need a calamari and a Caesar salad.
Okay, I-I d'know, you-you just- you have a quality.
Well if-if that's what it is, then it's-it's crazy.
Oh, we weren't talking about you. No, no way to recover.
The waiter carried the breadsticks in his pants!
I just talked to Joey, I just-I want to see how you were.
Honey, we don't really have to go to this thing tonight do we?
Well that's the best part. Umm, you guys get to decide!
I'm gonna go across the hall to check on the yams.
Now come on. Well, I'm glad we worked things out.
Dad, dad. We got it!! We Got It!!!
Okay, count to three. 1. 2. 3!
This is it. Yeah, this is the one. I can't believe I found it!
Oh, god... She's told you that already, didn't she?!
Dad! There's Ross , why don't you go talk to him?
: yeah he has to stay in Tulsa this weekend.
Oh God... Why don't they put chairs back here?!
Hey dad, what's up? Oh God. Ross, it's Nana.
Are you okay? You've been acting weird all afternoon.
This is different! Greg and Jenny are in a relationship.
Do you think breaking up with him was a huge mistake?
He would just roll me over and I would stop snoring.
That's not even a word! I can get this! I can get this!
Are you sure he didn't break it because it really hurts.
You've been lying to me? I can't believe you'd do that.
Outgoing! Did that say outgoing?! Not, outgoing!!!
Okay, so how do I make him think I wanna have sex with him?
What happened? You still have the Monica wedding fund don't you?
Even if I shrink down to two inches tall?
Wait a minute, who told you? You are dead meat.
Oh my God, oh my God. Call me on the phone!
All right. When is, when is the next flight out?
Apparently you were umm, a little mean to him in high school.
I know! Hey, you haven't been practising the routine, have you?
I don't know. Rachel I'm-I'm sorry that I hurt your ankles.
Joey, stop hitting on her! It's her wedding day!
I'm sorry, I can't help you. See? Rules are rules.
Yes smokie, that is what it was. I just can't get enough.
Joey, what's going on. What didn't you tell us you work here?
Oh!! You guys knew about this and you didn't tell us?!
Well, I'd like to but, I'm not sure we have time to go.
I didn't mean to cut it off. It was an accident.
Mom! Dad! Ross smoked pot in college!
Is all this about you not being able to grow a moustache?
Please, it's a relief is what it is, is what it is.
I just told my Mom I'd cater a party for her.
Oh please, he didn't hear it! He didn't hear it!!
Oh please! Why else would you have made out with Ross?!
So, why wait 'til Saturday, are you free tomorrow?
No, umm, he met some girl at the coffee house.
Phoebe? Oh, Phoebe, I'm so sorry. Have you been here long?
Honey, I'm not even going to pretend I was listening. Hey! Hey!
C'mon, you can't live off your parents your whole life.
Rachel! What is your cat doing in one of my bowls!
Well, now she has no eyebrows, mission accomplished.
I-I don't-I don't think that I'm gonna wear the boots tonight.
I won't give you anything, but you'll owe me 2.95.
Okay, have you considered using a girl with huge knockers?
Phoebe, do you want to go see a movie after dinner tonight?
No! Are you doing it?! I don't hear anything! Come on!
What is it? Is there something fundamentally unmarriable about me?
Don't worry, after a while he'll tune it out.
I wish I could say the same. I'm a little shook up!
The ones we had right after you almost threw up.
She's not pregnant. It's Rachel. Rachel's the one who's pregnant.
What?..... What, you wanna spell it out with noodles?
But Ben is coming over tonight and he can't see this.
I tried to reach you at work. There's....been a fire.
Oh hi! Hi! Y'know, we were just talking about bacon.
What do I smell? I smell smoke. Huh-did you smoke?
I don't care. Oh my god. I've lost the will to scold.
See, didn't I tell you?! You're getting over Ross already!
Ohh! Did you do what I said? Did-did-did you tell her?
So, did you play in college? sweatshirt he's wearing.)
Wait. He pooped in my shoe? Which one?
Ah no, the other Phoebe, the one you went to go see.
Go on, teach me something about men and women.
He took up the carpet, and now you can hear everything.
Rach! We weren't gonna miss our friends getting married!
Come on guys! Let's go! Come on, it's second down.
Hmm, well you're around me all the time and you don't flirt.
Y'know dad, Chandler is one of Ross's very best friends!
Ohmygod! Rat baby! Rat baby! Rat baby!
Look, here's a picture of Scotty Jared naked.
Live together? There have been no signs for that.
All right, umm, we're not gonna really keep it this way though.
I can't believe it! That there is no money for my wedding?!
No, you can't! Friends hooking up is a bad idea.
Why?! Why? Why, why would anybody do something like that?
I'll bet he's totally over me, I'll bet he's fine.
Oh, actually this year we just made him homemade cookies.
There are no jobs. There are no jobs for me.
Okay, wait, you gotta hang up 'cause we're gonna be late.
Oh my God! Ohh! Look at this one! It's so beautiful!
Oh, I wish I didn't have to wait to take a pregnancy test.
Mail call, Rachel Green, bunk seven.
Oh! Oh, my God! No wonder my mother hates me!
'Fraid so. Brown hair, green eyes...
Those cute little black ones I wear all the time.
Oh my God! Well push it in! Push it in!
Hey, guys, what-what should I wear to a Knicks game?
Well, um, because mainly, um, they don't like you. I'm sorry.
So Phoebe, why are there men's shoes by the door.
What's going on here? You go out with tons of girls.
The big hat, the pearls, the little pick handbag.
He's coming. Be cool, be cool, be cool.
I hope you're not full, 'cause dinner's almost ready.
Well you look incredible too! You're just-you're so fit!
If it is a new message, what is he calling to say?
Hi, welcome home. I need to borrow a hundred bucks.
So it looks like it's going really well for you two, huh?
He is so cute. So, where did you guys grow up?
You just put an empty carton back in the fridge!
OK, we got the cole slaw, we got the buns...
Spend more time with the tie. That'll make a baby.
Chandler, we said we would meet at the coffeehouse at six.
Well that is great. And seriously, she seems very nice.
So umm, what do you say we make it a weekly appointment?
How are we gonna get home? Maybe a piggy-back ride?
Twenty bucks says they're married within the month.
My pink flowered bra! I recognize the strap!
Joey, you're this guy's teacher. I mean how could you do this?
Hey, I have all the space I need. Just do what I did.
Wow! It took you all night to come up with that plan?!
Ooh, what'cha gonna do, fat boy, huh? What?
You have got to get over this. You're not gonna end up alone.
Hey Joey, Chandler sold a story to Archie Comics!
You just wanna stay home so you can make a move on Joey!
I can't believe he has a new roommate. Who is this guy?
Oh my God, you can't even see where the Titanic hit it.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I-I should probably leave you girls alone.
Oh my God! He just said my name! Did you hear that?
Can we have our drinks please?! Waiter-Uh, tress!
Hey, I made $17 before breakfast, what have you done?
I need more swordfish. Can you get me some more swordfish?
I'm sorry. I've never had a maid before, is this not okay?
Chandler, look I-I know that your dad embarrassed you. I know...
Well, I was going for wrong, but we can use your word.
Wait wait! I can't sing in front of all these people.
You can also find him under umm, dog and dead.
And make sure our room isn't next to theirs .
No it's not, b'cause she's still in love with Mike!
All right, sweetie that's fine. You didn't do it on purpose.
Wow! For just a week you guys are really close, huh?
Really! That long?! Look all you want, it's happening!
Woah, woah, woah, let's go back to 29.
Oh my god, little Stevie Fisher? How've you been?
Now, are you glad we didn't start with the bikini strips?
Ooh, umm, oh Kathy! Kathy, I love you! Oh!
Alright, I'm gonna go pick up a few things for the trip.
Because he'll know what to do? Oh my God, you're a genius!
But that's clearly a joke. This could easily be true.
You were staring about eight inches south of there.
I wanted to do this days ago so I think I should go first.
Wow, being dumped by you obviously agrees with her.
Of course we will, come on we gotta make dinner.
Well, that's okay dad, we-we can wait until later.
That's a great idea! I was saving them for something special.
Well, y'know it's none of my business, but aren't you married?
I'm sorry, they surprised me. There was nothing I could do!
Hard 8?! We should call it easy 8!
Hi. Alan, this is everybody. Everybody, this is Alan.
I arranged some pillows on the bed to look like a guy.
Thanks, I'm set. Do you still live with your parents?
It's not Richard! Okay? It's this new guy and he's really good.
Well, you used to dress up in Mom's clothes all the time.
Okay if Mike were here what would the two of you be doing?
Did it ever occur to you that I might just be that stupid?
Okay, Rachel, you wanna put the marshmellows in concentric circles.
Hi! Umm, I'm Monica Geller, I'm the chef at Alessandro's.
Upstairs in the bathroom right before you felt up mom.
Oh my God, I went to high school with her. Rachel! Hi!
Well...it's just umm...I'm afraid you might mess it up.
You guys, Joey just saw Janice kissing her ex-husband.
Yeah? What does she think of your little science project?
In that cute, little, sweet way she just did?
No you're fine. All right well, do you think I could take Rachel?
Look look! He's doing it again, the guy with the telescope!
Yeah, I'm going to take a bath. I'm just going to get a magazine.
Oh honey, is that 'cause your Mom died around Christmas?
Why don't you just be straight with her? Tell her the truth.
Well, we don't really have to decide anything right now, do we?
Huh? What'd ya say Joe? I'll be right there.
Thank you. All right, now who else do you want to invite?
So I, I told Rachel it was just gonna be the two of us.
... that she was the huge guy that mugged you? Yah.
No, wait, please don't go! I've got porn for you too!
Because you're on my team! And my team always wins!
Chandler, we can't let this tape wreck Valentine's Day!
That didn't work on mom, it's not going to work on us.
Yeah... yeah, I think there is. -What were you gonna say?
Umm, wait! Do you want to set the mood a little?
So I wouldn't need any, right? Cause I have a straight.
Ha ha, a joke that's funny in all countries.
Why don't you come over tonight? And I'll make you favorite dinner.
Yeah, we all have jobs. See, that's how we buy stuff.
I'm gonna go to the bathroom, maybe I'll see you there in a bit?
That is an excellent excellent question. That is excellent.
Okay, you can not tell Chandler. Okay? That I ran into Richard.
Well, it's done about two minutes before it looks like that.
That's right! You lose sucker!! Please still marry me.
I just thought it would be nice if I could have just this one night!
Wait, we're supposed to organize the wrapping paper drawer.
Wait a minute, she isn't... She's not the one who you...
Oh god, waddawe do, waddawe do, waddawe do?
I know, after you left the store, I chose different ones.
Okay? Ooo wee! Christmas party in my boots!
No, nononono.. it's just.. things change. People change.
Congratulations! Wow! I can't believe you're nominated for an Emmy!
Okay, well, why don't we all meet upstairs in an hour?
Well, he's my parents' best friend, he has to be there.
Alright, I've got a leg, three breasts and a wing.
I'll meet somone else. There'll be other Alans.
Did you ever go out with a guy your friends all really like?
Ohhh, oh my God! Oh my God! She knows about us!
Oh, that's there on the bottom, see the manager, Chandler Bing.
Oh, not at all. I have no morals and I need the cash.
I'll take it down to 95% but that's the best I can do.
Joey, she was listing the countries she's done it in.
Uh- Rachel has left the building, can you call back?
No, no, no, no, no, no pressure, no pressure!
There's nothing to tell! He's just some guy I work with!
How would that go? Well, it didn't rhyme, but I liked it.
William Sonoma, fall catalog, Page 27.
Excuse me, umm, can I talk to you over here for just a second?
What are you, animals? It's 4 o'clock in the afternoon!
Does Ralph mumble when you're not paying attention?
Ross, we haven't done the routine since middle school.
All right baby, come on! Yes! Yes! I am on fire!
I'm Monica Gellar. Who do you know the bride and groom?
You know what this is, this is us getting ready for the prom.
No, he'll be fine. It's the other five I'm worried about.
Who? Who do you know that are friends that just fool around?
Honey, it's not pushy, he gave her his home number.
So, did you come by to watch us win the big bucks?
No, please don't. Please, Joey. She will kill us!
Nope. Going to the Big Apple Circus today.
Ross married Rachel in Vegas! And got divorced! Again!!!!
Now? Is it okay if I go out with Chip Matthews?
This is so cool, maybe this is something you can do every week.
Hey, have you figured out a way to tell him you're moving out?
He's not boring! He's just-he's just low key.
That does not mean you know us better, I-I want a rematch.
You know how much I love listening to your music, you know, but...
Oh yeah, well there's the possibility that I won't make rent.
Fine. I'm just glad I didn't give her my secret ingredient.
As a thank you, Rachel and I will kiss for one minute.
Hey, Rache. You know what we haven't played in a while?
Oh my god, Joey, for all we know this guy could be horribly...
What are you talking about?! 007 has all those gadgets!
Nothing, just never seen you in little stretchy pants before.
I think, that if you really like this guy, you should just trust him.
Can you believe it? I finally get to run my own kitchen!
Okay, great! Bye. So guess who's coming to Thanksgiving dinner?
Yes you are! That's the only way to explain all this stuff!
I'm fine, just a little tired, I'm okay. How's Richard doing?
Gosh, doesn't it seem like a million years ago?
Here's Frannie. Hmm, won't she be happy to see me?
I can't believe you thought I was cheating. You own me an apology.
No. You don't have any of these cute little obsessive things.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You know what, the way you did it was just fine.
Well actually, I-I didn't eat mine. It's still in the bathroom.
Well you can't! We're booked solid for the next month!
Phoebe, they didn't make you pay for those knives, did they?
Wow. Then I would definitely not recommend Mrs. Doubtfire.
I know why do you think he was so worried about me getting bigger?
It's on us, all right, so don't worry. It's our treat.
Oh wait! You didn't just sit on my Kit-Kats did you?!!
And well, we probably shouldn't see each other anymore. I'm sorry.
Wait a minute! We're talking about someone that I'm going out with?
Wait, what that place, that pub he took us too?
Alright . I think it's a big mistake but it's your decision.
Okay, let's start with the free messages outside the UN.
Okay, let's do it. Mom and Dad are gonna be so faced!
What are you doing here? I thought you had to do inventory all day.
Even Mary Tyler Moore would've been better.
Chandler, you're an only child, right? You don't have any of this.
I know, what about Rachel? I mean how are we even gonna ask her?
Phoebe, do you think that your favorite animal says much about you?
I'm sorry honey, but we're gonna take you shopping. It's gonna be fine.
How could I be asleep knowing that you were in the next room.
Welcome to the real world! It sucks. You're gonna love it!
Do you want to go to the bathroom, or do you wanna play poker?
That's right. Get it out of your system while we're alone.
Are you nuts?! We've got George Stephanopoulos' pizza!
He's with Emily at a Bed and Breakfast in Vermont!
Right! .. but we "know" what you're wishing for!
Matt Guire, Mark Lynn, Ben Wire...
Ohh, sweetie! Hey, I bet you anything that he's gonna call you again.
Oh, you're welcome for the party. I'm glad you're having a good time.
Honey, that's a great idea nailing the boxes to the floor!
I guess that makes sense. So, you think you're going to talk to him?
I wanted it for years! I was gonna make cookies for my children.
Hey, guys, guys, did you see my new, china cabinet?!
Oh God bless my dad sound proofing the basement!
Rach, you know that birthing tape you wanted to see? It's here.
No fair. I don't even have one. How come they get two?
Phoebe, don't worry about it. I'm sure she wants to live with you.
Tell them I'm a chef in a big New York restaurant!
Hello? Oh, hi Ross! See? Other people call me!
Bye bye Mike!/Cya mike!/Bye mike!/Bye bye now!
I have been looking for them all week and she is wearing them!
Hah, no no no no no no no no no no.
And that's why, I'm not inviting you in for a drink. Bye.
This isn't how it's supposed to go, there can't be another guy.
You know what, I think it's cute, you trying to be more like Richard.
If-if-if we ever did what you did a man would never call.
Yeah, I think that fifth shower actually got the interview off me.
Alright, great. Thanks a lot. I'm going to tap class.
Chandler, we still haven't gotten an RSVP from your dad.
Oh my God! Then-then-then what are we even doing?! What is this?!
Welcome home. I've missed you. join me in the bedroom?
Oh wow wow wow!! Make room for your friend!
I know it's last minute, but we decided to have a Halloween party.
What-what's the matter? Is there, is there something on my dress?
It's only been a couple of hours, so just give it some time.
Okay! Okay! We can take a hint! What are you doing here?!
Joe... Emus are birds. You raise them for meat.
Forty-two to twenty-one! Like the turkey, Ross is done!
I've got a question. Richard made plans again with the guys.
These tiny, little non-breasts?! Please, it's gotta be Rachel.
Wow! And around the ankles, y'know that is a tough spot.
By the way, Ross dropped by a box of your stuff.
Wow! It's really red! You should go see my eye doctor.
See now-now you're taking them away from their home.
Aw, I'm sorry sweetie that she doesn't feel the same way.
Three down knows I'm married, what's three down doin'?
Run, Marcel, run! Run, Marcel! Are you okay?
Yeah. Run ten blocks, that'll help the smell.
I won't care, because I know you will be feeling it all in here.
Pretty much. So, what do you, what do you think of the floor?
Oh, is it that pinball machine with the big bow on it?
Oh, good to see you too. Did you come down here to tell me that?
Okay.. Well, I'm going out with a guy my friends all really like.
Wait, you're giving me your Porsche, you're kidding me right?!
Is he really coming? Because I can see right into your apartment!
I know! Although, you did tell an awful lot of jokes.
That's what you've been working on for the past two hours?!
You promised Dr. Weinburg, you'd never use that phrase.
I eat by myself in the alley because everybody hates me.
Well, maybe you're right-She made fun of my phone pen!
Stop it. Stop! Okay let's go. We can be strong.
Get in there man! Flirt back, mix it up!
That was some hot love you gave me! I'm gonna go get ready.
All right, I'll do it just this once! But you can't tell anybody!
For the sixteenth time, no... I do not think you're obsessive.
I personally would be honored if she wanted to live with me.
Look umm, of all people, you do not want me to tell this story!
I knew it!! Y'know, you're not so quiet yourself, missy!
Good. Uh honey, the Miami Vice soundtrack? Really?
Hey, they don't pay me a penny a word to make friends.
I love it! It's huge!! Let's open it! Open it!!
Pleased to meet you. So you're coming to Rachel's party tonight?
Maybe. I just hope she realizes how hard it's gonna be.
Did you ever feel like sometimes you are just so unbelievably uncoordinated?
Mr. Bigot. He tells the most racist jokes.
I'm sure everything's fine. Has her water broke yet?
Oh wait, Chandler, come here is there anything I can do? Anything?
What?! Are you crazy?! I'm not getting married! I'm not even engaged.
Or if you want to kiss him, umm, you could use mistletoe.
Quick, take off your dress, he won't notice the bed.
Two? TWO? How is that possible? I mean, have you seen you?
Well, if you don't have anything to copy, why are you going down there?
You guys are dead, I am so good at lighting rounds.
Wait a minute! Now I'm betting against all three of you?
I'm gonna go tell Joey that that you're back. I was really worried about you.
We'll be right there! Can't you just say it starts later?
I said that you had a nice butt, it's just not a great butt.
Oh good God! If you want a baby so bad just go steal it!
Phoebe, you do seem a little tense. Here, let me help you.
I don't believe you spent my wedding fund on the beach house!
How can you tell? You can only see the back of his head!
No kidding, out of towners huh? What did you tell 'em?
So. Welcome. Is this your first time you're seeing Emma?
Oh my God! Ross, are you in England? Was Emily surprised?
We know how tough those parent/teacher conferences can be.
Hey! Where 'ya headin' in those pants? 1982?
I gotta go to work. Has anybody seen my left boob?
Oh Rachel, I know the best coffee house and it's sooo close.
This woman's got my life, I should get to see who she is.
Is anyone thankful for anything else besides a thong?
Well thank God you were here! I mean, we have to erase that!
Yeah, I'd say so. And there's no 'j' in 'engorged'.
I swear I've seen birds do this on Wild Kingdom.
Who has her own little desk when Roland's not there.
It's okay, 'cause y'know what? You don't really need me for the business.
No, but someone's really not going to get over that idea, are they?
Oooh, I wish she could stay here, but Chandler is allergic!
Hi! Can you do that and walk? 'Cause she said, "Next."
It's never taken you more than a shower to get over a relationship.
You go back out there and you seduce her till she cracks!
That guy stood on your neck until you passed out!
No, the one who looked at you once because you got in her way.
Phoebe, we're getting married, married; not sixth grade married.
Besides, if anybody's gonna get free stuff, it's gonna be me.
Well, the good news is, I don't think anyone's looking at us.
That's my old dog. He passed away years ago.
Yes, I'm sure! Rachel is there something that you want to talk me about?
Are you kidding me?! Is this; is this turning you on?
Well, maybe you could give to somebody else. Ooh, like Ross Geller.
Y'know what? I-I think that umm, I don't feel like going to The Plaza.
Well, I guess we've established who's staying here with Monica...
Is that the one that speaks English or the one that doesn't?
It's wrong. You know what else is wrong? Phoebe picking Rachel.
Okay. Let's hurry-Oh wait! Do we have a condom? Oh right!
Maybe a Hello Kitty doll, the ability to walk...
Hello? What?! You what?! Hey you listen here missy! Wh-
She's over a week late! She gotta have it today, right?
: Honey why don't you just let it go and ask her out again.
On three, 1...2...3! Now my pillow's all wet!
Hey, don't mix those up, you could really ruin that lollipop.
No, you don't want this. I want to have your grandmother's cookie recipe.
My God! Chandler, we said be 'aloof' not 'a doof'.
Well it wasn't my fault, Phoebe was in charge of the invitations!
Okay, so what do you, what do you want to do? Let's do something crazy!
With that moustache doesn't Chandler remind you of Aunt Sylvia?
All right, just give it back to me when your done. See you guys.
Yeah, good for you. Y'know you're tough, you lived on the streets.
Sweetie okay. It's okay. Everybody made it to the wedding. I'm fine.
Hey, do you realize that at this time tomorrow we'll be getting married?
You know what, Ross? I'm gonna throw in 50 bucks for you.
Of course you can look at it! Yeah, I want your opinion too!
Ok, fine!! I bought 20 extra tickets for me and Chandler.
You are so handsome! I wanna make love to you right here, right now!
Well, I know that would make Joey happy, so, I would like that too.
All right, were you guys smoking something in the back of our van?
You must feel horrible. Hey! The guys have free porn!
All right, I'm gonna go to work. Does anybody have a problem with that?
Phoebe! Come on I'm serious! I just got to talk to him about all this.
And I don't know if you've noticed but she's a HOTTY!! HI!
Ohh! Ohhhh! Were you sleeping sweetie? I'm sorry. Here.
Oh, honey, can you make sure we get a King size bed!
Rach, that's great! It's so good that you had a good time in Greece!
You ordered a stripper for the shower?! That is totally inappropriate!
Put the plates in the boxes!! Put the plates in the boxes!
Joey, please don't do that. I think it's best that we just forget about it.
Mom, uh, Chandler was just saying how beautiful your sweater is.
I can't live like this! What are we gonna do? What are we gonna do?
Oh please! Did you hear that? Little drops of heaven.
Uh yeah, I-I actually I thought about you a couple months ago.
The fuzzy little mints at the bottom of her purse.
No-no-no, don't-don't do the accent. You've got to see her again.
'A Woman Undone, by Rachel Karen Green'.
Nobody move! Okay, you look that way; I'll look this way!
It was a project for one of the Home Ec classes.
I guess you can get back to deciding on what to get me for a present!
Oh, maybe he was getting him confused with his childhood therapist.
Hello? Hello? Oh! Rachel, it's Paolo calling from Rome.
Great! We're hangin' in the kitchen! Let's stay in the kitchen!
Come on. I know you're not eighteen anymore, but give it a minute.
Oh. So you made her walk the plank? Aye, matie?
Okay, I've got some Ones, you wanna put them in her panties?
Wait, Joey! Joey! That doesn't mean that-that you're in love with me!
So do you think that these pictures-Are, are they trying to tell a story?
Do you want some shortbread? Eh that's Scottish like you are.
How can that be?! Oh wait! Wait! Are you, are you serious?!
Ok, we're not having birthday cake, we're having birthday flan.
Absolutely! It would just be one friend helping out another friend.
What, Phoebe, did you whip the potatoes? Ross needs lumps!
You know, if you just wait another... six and a half minutes...
Why don't you just have a seat here? OK... give me the Gummi-bears.
It's not gonna happen. They're doing it tonight, we can do it tomorrow.
What happened to your rule about never sleeping with sick people?
I love how it crumbles. Now see, your chocolate doesn't do that.
Well, when you first met Barry, you flitted off to Vail.
Umm, if ah, it might be okay if Ross came skiing?
Well, she's not going to find them lying in the grass like that.
I can't believe it! What is it? Is it the rubbing or the smell?
Chandler, what are you doing? That thing can put someone's eye out!
Okay! Okay, let's race! First one there wins! Ha-ha!
Y'know, I don't like to brag about it, but I give the best massages!
You touch people's eyeballs every day and this feels weird.
Where were you? We were supposed to meet in the wine cellar?
Yeah, apparently they're turning it into some kinda coffee place.
I know that there's no hole there, I just really liked that picture.
Ross this is the only thing left that has a shot at working.
Dad , Mom . Look! Look who it is it's Chandler!
A new pair of shoes for the Chan-Chan man! Yes!
Chandler, relax it's not a contest. Certainly not a close one.
Hey, come on Phoebe, you can understand why this would be weird for me.
I'd like to have Don and Phoebe over. Wouldn't that be nice?
No, they were really cool. They were on their honeymoon too!
Oh my gosh! Rachel, honey.. are you okay? Where-where's Paolo?
I missed you-you ugly, flat faced old freak!
What one? You wanted him to invite you to the party and he did it!
But you should eat them now because they're hot from the oven.
Chandler, please don't think I was trying to pressure you. Phoebe and Rachel...
Oh, who cares, they still love me! "I am so excited..."
Yeah. It's my dad's birthday, I decided to give him a stroke.
I'm not crying about that! I'm crying about something that happened at work.
Didn't you hear that speech? If you don't kiss him then I will!
I don't have anything like that, but let me go see if Rachel does.
I mean, I-I, I really shouldn't say. I mean, I'm really not supposed to.
Phoebe, Sandra's mad at you too. It-it doesn't bother you?
Okay, can we change the topic? Because it's really doing nothing for me.
No, it's not bad. It's not bad at all. It's-it's really nice.
Hey guys check it out! My mom sent me the paper!
See? They're as different as night and... later that night.
Hello? Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Okay. I guess we can bet one more time.
Oh, don't you guys look cute. You guys make such a cute couple.
Okay, does it involve something to do with Pete's computer company?
Yeah, the best you got in high school was Wet Pants Geller.
Don't joke with me, okay? I'm very, very upset right now.
That's Dudley Moore. I said I wanted it like Demi Moore.
Our kids are gonna call her Aunt Janice aren't they?
There's no man in here. How dare you accuse me of that.
All right okay, just so you know, I'm not gonna make a turkey this year.
A wuss? Excuse me for living in the real world, okay?
And everybody has to wear costumes. Come on! It'll be fun!
Okay! Okay! Okay! We'll see you in about 3 to 4 hours.
Rach, get the heat. Ross, could you turn the heat down please?
Phoebe, listen. You were with me, and we were shopping all day.
Wow! And you got a petticure. Your feet are all dressed up.
Ross, you were right before, it was just a stupid fight about a room.
Hi, um, I'm gonna need a new set of these forms .
Wouldn't kick her out of bed. No more Vodka for me!
Okay, I talked to the guy with the shovel and I found out what happened.
Ohh come on, I love this song! Come on, you'll be fine.
So on this road trip, did you guys win any money?
This is so great! Now we can enter into doubles tournaments!
Chandler, nobody likes breaking up with someone. You just gotta do it.
I'm fine-d. I'm fine-d! Y'know, it's a really hard word to say.
Good. Okay, I'm just gonna wait for Chandler to open the rest of them.
I think I feel ok about it. Actually I think I feel really good about it.
Okay, this isn't working. I'm still awake and now I have to pee.
Hey Joey! Aww, you remembered even though you're a big star!
You're gonna like him so much. So umm, when do you want to meet him?
Two in a row! You've got to use your tongues now!
Wait a minute! He stopped talking the minute Phoebe came in!
Chandler come on. We have to hem the new dust ruffle.
Congratulations, I think youve found the worlds thinnest argument.
The Way You Look Tonight is on here! Dance with me?
What are you serious? You wanna marry him? Wha... What about Mike?
Nah, while you're at Ross's if you see any lying around...
: then why were you watching them and giving YOURSELF a treat.
Joey, what are you doing?! It's never gonna happen, she's seeing somebody.
Ross, just forget about it. This guy's got you totally wedged in.
Oh my pleasure. Okay, I'm afraid I've got some bad news. Phoebe!
I-I-I wanna thank you all for coming. My family and my friends...
Relax! You'll be fine. Oh much better. You're invisible now.
I'm Monica. I'm disgusting. I stalk guys and keep their underpants.
Yeah. I'm okay. I'm actually-I'm a little cold, can I have your jacket?
Ahhh, hey honey? Don't you have to be at your interview now?
Hey Rach, maybe your resolution should be to umm, gossip less.
Yeah! I didn't know there would be dancing. That was a fun surprise!
Okay, please be good, please. Just remember how much you all like me.
No! I was just getting into position and then everything went dark.
Umm. Well, there's Rachel, and umm, I think that's it. How bout you?
Oh come on! You're making it sound worse than it actually was.
Ross, I think we should stick to the routine, we don't wanna look stupid!
Hey Joey! Isn't that the girl that waved at you the other day?
What about the second minister we meet with? I kinda liked him.
All right, look, nobody's smoking pot around all this food.
Ross , foot on the floor or come over no more!
What is going on with you? Since when are you so crazy about babies?
I can't think of anything we're doing. Why can't I think of anything we're doing?
God, Ross is on a date with your sister! How weird is that?!
You're right, I'm sorry. It's not like you're y'know, going out with an ex-girlfriend.
Look it is not my fault that your chairs are incredibly ugly!
Excuse me, sir, would it help if I weren't wearing underpants?
Okay, I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I-I-I was um, I was taking a nap.
Phoebe, y'know why don't we just go upstairs and have some birthday cake?
I'm just saying, if we put just a little bit of makeup on you.
Finger cramp. Oh God, sorry. Here, let me get that mom.
Hey. Where is he, where's Richard? Did you ditch him?
Now, this is last minute so I want to apologize for the mess. Okay?
Wait, wait, he came up with that himself. Tell them, Chandler.
Hi. Uh, we'll be right there, we're just trying to decide something.
The dinner will be ready in twenty minutes. This is so exciting.
Well, this may sound crazy, but there maybe something we could fashion.
I can't believe this. Do you think that your parents could help pay for it?
Oh, that's okay, I can't wait to see everything again! All of the memories...
So you can like, bite, and pull people's hair and stuff?
Ping pong? Honey, they have ping pong! Let's play!
I think this is so great! I mean, you and Ross! D-did you have any idea?
Yeah, but Janice? That-that was like the worst breakup in history!
Because Purvry Perverson over here can't stop staring at her.
Also both of your sisters called and neither can make it.
Oh, that's okay. By the way, I was just checking the shower massager.
Are we playing football or what? Come on you hairy-backed Marries.
Rachel umm, I was just talking to this guy and I think he'll have sex with you.
Ohh, here you are. Y'know, I'm-I'm glad you decided to hear me out.
Um, and, well there's the.. the the small matter of...
Oh, you two must have been so cute running around on a barge.
Umm, going to the beach. When it stays light real late.
..well, why don't you tell them? After all it, is your ankle.
They gave us a fake number? Why? Why would they do that?
Noo! My ex-boyfriend Richard! Y'know the tall guy, moustache?
And people will think you own a Porsche because you're wearing the clothes?
No! Ace is low! Ace, two, three, four!
Mr. Heckles, our friend lost a monkey. Have you seen it?
Oh my God! That's Pete! But why is Bill huggin' Pete?
That is the unusual activity. Look, they just wanna see if you're okay.
Sweetie, I think the glasses look great. They make you look really sexy.
Rachel! I'm never gonna think it's okay for you to cheat on your husband!
Anyway erm, are you going to get a handyman to install this stuff?
So! Dinner in the kitchen around four! I'll see you then.
Yes, a relationship. For your information I am crazy about this man.
That really means a lot. Oh, and Mom, don't bite your nails.
Y'know what, that's fine, maybe you haven't grown up, but I have.
I'm fine! I just, I'm thinking how much it's an end of era.
I can't walk. Okay? Okay? These boots were a huge mistake!
A quin pidio el pollo General Tso?
I guess I set up the video camera to try and entice Joey.
Ah, and I mean, he's going out with her? He can not persue this.
Hey! It's me. Mon-i-ca! Can I just tell you how proud I am of you.
I can't leave it! You gouged a hole in my dingy floor.
Inside of telling us you decided to write in your stupid book!
And I assume, Chandler, you are still boycotting all the pilgrim holidays.
Jellyfish sting! Oh, it hurts! It hurts!! It hurts!!
No it's umm, more like a wrap. Okay so uh, I'm gonna go guys.
Well, I mean I guess there is no harm in putting my name down.
Honey, wait. We only did it once. It didn't mean anything to me.
We're not really gonna buy these people steak dinners are we?
Umm, Chandler, if you want I can make you some macaroni and cheese for dinner.
You-you gotta take it now. Come on, do it as a present to me.
Well I'd probably be scared of a guy using a fake voice.
Okay, so I'm responsible, I'm organised. But hey, I can be a kook.
Yes! We found you a really cute and funny guy from Chandler's work!
Okay! You get the vacuum cleaner and I'll get the furniture polish!
We're just two people who find each other very attractive. Right?
Thank you. This is my friend Phoebe. She's gonna be helping me tonight.
Uh, Rach... how come you have dental floss in your hair?
No! No. They're umm... They're just uh...ground beef smileys.
Didn't it drive you crazy to have a switch and not know what it did?
Right, you only go for them 5 minutes before they get married.
Right. Till I bought a blow dryer, then I was shunned.
Why in the world would you take this tape and and why would you watch it?
I thought I lost it. I got a new one, like, a month ago.
Umm, this is going to be fun. Watch me freak out Chandler. Honey?
I think our lover's spat will start a little early this month.
Well, let's just say it's not the first time you've stolen my thunder.
No-no, I-I really don't want to talk about it! I don't! Especially with you.
There's still so much to do. Have you written your vows yet?
I can't believe my parents are actually pressuring me to find one of you people.
Hey Rach, remember that great song, Me, Myself, and I?
Ooh, an ink stain! Hey, can I watch how you get this out?
What?! You're crazy! There's nothing sexual about the noises I make!
Passport, check! Camera, check! Traveller's cheques, check!
Uh, I don't know, butter, eggs, flour, lime, kiwi--
He called the Long Island Expressway a concrete miracle.
They love my candy? Oh man!!! I've gotta go make more!!
Now stop it! Double or nothing that she has it by tomorrow!
Hey, Rach, can I borrow your eyelash curler, I think I lost mine.
Ok, but if something gets broken, and then the Queen comes over..
Hey, did you get the turkey basted-Oh my God! Oh my God! Who is that?
Who do you think would win in a fight, Catwoman or Supergirl?
Come on! So she comes to the wedding! I mean it won't be so bad.
I know! I mean it's like me and your dad, that's a totally separate thing.
Yeah, he used to have this recurring nightmare, just really freaked him out.
No no, it's not working on me. Wow! I must be growing up!
Okay, I will. Remember that thing that we just discussed that you wanted to do?
Well, maybe the mailman liked the cookies, we just didn't give him enough.
Well, I mean what about friends of your grandmother's? Wouldn't they have the recipe?
Just like you told her you did! ... Just pointing out the irony.
No! Umm well, some people say that Oysters are an aphrodisiac.
Would you slap me? Would you slap me right here in the face?!
All right! Come on Monica! Look alive! Come on, look alive!
Oh it's umm, good! It's umm, it's good, just here watering the plants.
You guys! Do you realize that any minute now, Phoebe can be pregnant?
Okay, it's baby time. Pants off Bing. Didn't see you there Geller.
Hey Ross! So, I was checking out the uh, real estate section...
You don't? Well, that's the difference between a professional and a layman.
Oh, yes, umm, I'm here to pick up a dress that you have on hold.
Oh my God, she's not gonna like the chicken that night either is she?!
Do you umm, you really think the best reason to get married is because you're sorry?
It worked! Ooh baby baby baby, ooh baby baby baby!
Doesn't matter, I'll get 'em tomorrow. Or not. Whenever.
We are going to Dick Clark's New Year's Rocking Eve!
Oh! Did anybody see that-that documentary on the Korean War?
No, Chandler's still in Phase One, and Joey's that thing you smell.
Well what are you gonna do when he finds out he wasn't even asked?!
Ooh! I'm sorry! I think, I THINK, that may have missed the table!
Yeah, ah, but Pheebs don't you think he's a little young to get married?
Oh, we used to drive each other crazy playing the shadow game.
Toe the line. Thread the needle. Think outside the box!
Well, tonight, I actually went out with Chip Matthews in high school.
So your first whole weekend without Ben, what're you guys gonna do?
God, you are so lucky. I mean, I mean. . . you know what I mean.
Joey let me ask you a question. What does this light switch do?
Well, this must've brought back some really bad memories for you, Ross.
Well, it was either a pink bunny or no bunny at all.
She's the actress that was in Disclosure, Indecent Proposal, Ghost!
I got one. "Socks. Because your family's feet deserve the best."
Like I remember his office number! Speed dial 7.
How hammered are you? Huh? These, these are Joey's sisters.
No I don't know Chandler! Not anymore! It's like it's like something's changed.
Well, if we owe it? Oh my... When is Joey gonna be home?
Please! I feel so bad! Just watch the hot woman get naked!
I know, he's just so, so... Do you remember you and Tony DeMarco?
Dr. Burke? I don't think so. I mean, like, he's a grown up.
Oh, some idiot customer put a suggestion in the suggestion box.
No it's not! No! No! Now it's about you and Ross getting back together!
Oh, I'm so glad you guys like it. Yay! All right I gotta go to work.
You're still gonna pay me, right? Or something a little less selfish.
All right relax Mr. I've Had Sex Four Times!
Oh, you really want to talk about getting people to like you huh, funny man?
Ok, you're being wierd. Do you want sex or did you do something bad?
Ok, let me go check. Your mom want's to say goodbye.
No, but I will leave a sweater that smells like me right next to you!
What are you talking about? If you get married in Vegas you're married everywhere.
well no offense honey, but your taste is a little feminine for me.
Uh, huh. Or maybe to a galaxy far, far away.
Dr. Miller? P E C F D.
It was great! It was great! How about you?! I mean you're having a baby!
Okay, I feel like I'm talking to Lassie. All right, Phoebe would you just tell me!
Ah, come on, sneakers are easy. You wear sneakers all the time.
Limited seating my ass. Let's see who made the cut. Hi!
Ugly Naked Guy's laying kitchen tile. Eww!
Rachel, you are packed though right, I mean please tell me that you're packed.
Not never. I mean, I'm gonna see him tomorrow at my eye appointment.
Hey. Okay, I gave him another chance, but Tim has got to go!
Ok, which one of us do you think is gonna be the first one to get married?
Hey! Okay, so I thought we'd start with my make up and then do my hair.
Oh, it's so beautiful. Ohh! Y'know, I-I don't know if I feel right about this.
Hi. Uh, you... you don't know me, I'm Monica Geller... Ross's sister.
No, but... I saw the previews. They played it right before Jackass.
Sweetie, you know I have no sense of humor when it comes to the wedding.
You want a job? Turn off "Oprah," and send out a resume!
I didn't even tell him to say that. . All right you're off my list.
Just a little but...it's just so scary! I don't even know what I would sing...
Oh, it was awful. I guess some people just don't appreciate really good food.
It was a mistake. Please don't take this to mean anything, because it doesn't.
Hey Rach, the tampons here are only a penny. Let's stock up.
Ohh, I'm such an idiot. I can't believe I actually thought she could change.
Wait a minute, wait a minute. Yes he is. You are totally different.
And then he told me he would run away with me, and he didn't.
A little tight? I could see double-oh and seven in those pants.
'S'going pretty good, y'know? It's nice, and, we're having fun.
Guys, rules are good! Rules help control the fun! Ohhh!
Look look! It's Rachel and Barry. No, don't everybody look at once!
God, this is so hard. I can't decide between lamb or duck.
Forget it. Not after your cousin who could belch the alphabet.
Got it! Got it! Got it! Got it! Got it! Got it!
No, but she likes me. You abandoned her on a plane to Greece.
Say it louder, I don't think the guy all the way in the back heard you!
No! Joey and Ross don't know anything and Chandler still thinks that Phoebe's pregnant.
Wait, what about the time I hit you in the face with the Silvian's pumpkin?
Rach? Can I talk to for just a minute? I-I dropped some socks.
Yeah sure, nature called, she wanted to see who else did.
Why don't you just stop doing stupid things? Then you wouldn't have to apologize.
Excuse me, Mrs. Burkart? Well, we're all cleaned up in the kitchen.
Oh, I asked one of the waitresses at work if she'd help me out.
He says he wants to leave the country. He thinks you hate him.
I need two. I'm bringing Pete. My boyfriend. I have a boyfriend now!
What these? Oh, these are, um, for.. cuts and scrapes.
Well, next time your massaging him, you should try and distract yourself.
Michelle! Of course, it was Michelle! Did it sound like Michelle?
This is so great! This is exactly how we set the plates at the restaurant.
We don't have much time. Once the egg descended the oviduct ...
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
Cute PJ's! You're really livin' it up here in London huh?
Oh that's so sweet! Look Chandler I don't care if you can't cry, I love you.
Yes, I want to change. And why-why don't you go down and get us a table?
Yes, I will start with the carpaccio, and then I'll have the grilled prawns.
Oh Rachel don't, don't you dare, don't, don't. Tell him I cook.
I don't know. Hey, Rachel, you want the big plate? I want you to have the big plate.
Carol called me to thank me for the lasagna, I asked, she told me.
I know! I know! And he totally freaked out and I can't find him anywhere!
Did you also have his album, It's Not Easy Being Green?
No! You don't know the system! There'll be nobody messing with the system!
I can't belive it, I'm gonna be an aunt. I'm gonna have like a nephew.
Oh no no no no... this is dangerous territory. Keep it clean!
I'm guessing your new girlfriend wouldn't urinate on my coffee table.
Oh Ross, sometimes grown-ups have commitments they just can't get out of!
Oh no, she's still at work, but she told me to tell you to call her.
Oh, hang on, hang on. Does Aunt Monica get a say in this?
Well maybe I'm ready now. I mean, it's a little scary, but maybe it's right.
I'm Catwoman, who wants to borrow the dress when you're too big for it.
Y'know, I-I... I have to figure...some st-Y'know, some stuff before I can...
Do you think things would have been better if you'd just told her the truth?
Phoebe! Come on! Let's go! Come on! Why aren't you dressed yet?!
I know, but y'know, this time you're gonna definitely know whether or not you did it!
Hey, you know I got a question for ya. Just a little thing, no pressure.
What if my own baby hates me? Huh? What am I gonna do then?
: I saw what you were doing in Tulsa. angry sharks turn you on!
Ugh, they sent me home. They said I can't work if I'm sick.
I gotta tell you, yesterday was amazing. That massage felt so good!
Which we are, and-and we already paid for it. It's My Giant!
Dr. Greene. Oh my God it's Rachel's dad. What're you doing here?
We ripped that couple apart, and kept the pieces for ourselves.
I don't know. I mean, I guess having sex in front of a baby isn't so...
We're gonna pick up the wedding dress then we're gonna have lunch with mom.
Op, can I just tell you something? Very flattered but umm, I'm engaged.
Where's Benny? There he is! Where's Benny, there he is.
Because they don't know we're dating. Do you think we should eat in the kitchen?
What does he think? Does he think I'm just gonna wait around for nothing?
What I said was, was that I understood. Joey's the one who agreed with you!
Wendy, we had a deal! Yeah, you promised! Wendy! Wendy! Wendy!
And Phoebe is his friend, so he thinks that would be breaking the rules!
Wow. My brother never even told me when he lost his virginity.
Have a seat. Okay, listen umm, Chandler and I are going to live together, here.
Frannie was the one who found your Playboys and showed them to mom.
Come on, that was back in high school! How could that still bother you?
Were not doing anything. Were just sitting around talking, quietly.
Wow! All right well, I mean, what can you do? If you lost it you lost it.
'Cause I ran into him at the bank, he is still soo cute.
You are going to make a joke about my special present! Why would you do that?!
Aren't you afraid that Joey's going to figure all of this out? I heard it.
Nothing. Just something I want to get Phoebe's opinion on for Valentine's Day.
Hey, we would still be living here if hadn't gotten the question wrong!
I just thought that if I could follow the wire I could find out what it did.
When you were reading the dirty magazines without taking off the plastic!
Come on...I just need it for some rent and..and some other bills.
Yeah! But, he can't not exactly see Emily, I mean that's his wife.
What did the doctor say? Any news on when the baby will come?
I'm telling you, she went to the airport, and she's gonna go for it with Ross!
Who's so brave, you're so brave, yes you are, you're so brave.
I still don't get why Greg and Jenny would give us a fake number.
No way! You had your party, now I have mine! Is everything alright?
You are so sweet to notice! Yes, I lost three and a half pounds!
Thank you. It was so beautiful. I'm going to go to Joeys and get the pies.
Ohh, he's really shy. I-I don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet.
So, I'm, I'm probably still ovulating. Do you want to give it another try?
Not the way they're doing it. What, what happened? How did she die?
STOP IT!! ...Oh my God. It's true! Who am I?
Ross has never checked out of a room a minute before he had to.
Okay. We have got to beat them! {Here we go yet again.}
Well, he did manage to keep his identity secret for a long time.
Yeah! Oh and interesting because I found the cameras in one of our bags!
When I take a shower, she leaves me little notes on the mirror.
Okay, the red ones are my guests and the blue ones are yours.
You should feel great about yourself! You're doing this amazing independence thing!
Uh, so anyway, we thought one of you could read something during the ceremony.
Because... I'm Monica Geller. It was my credit card you were using.
All right. Have you said, "I love you?" You could say, I love you.
Oh good, another dinosaur story. When are those gonna become extinct?
Joey, we had a deal. That-that's why you're here! I've got to fire you!
Well, they're just gonna have to wait aren't they? I've only got two hands!!
Probably some y'know, European good-bye thing he picked up in London.
Come on! Come on, I was kidding! It was such an obvious joke!
Okay, I'm never gonna wear them again. I just didn't get a chance to say goodbye.
All right shut up for a second and let me just see something. Oh, wow!
'Cause, Gary and Phoebe think they're a hotter couple than we are!
Wait wait wait. I was at home the whole time. How did I missed that?
Umm, listen I am sorry, but I'll put some out first thing in the morning.
Phoebe I think he would notice if you didn't have a baby in nine months!
No, it doesn't say where it came from. Where would we return it?
Hello? Oh yes, one minute please. It's for you. It's the fire inspector.
It's goin' great. Right on schedule. Got my little happy helpers.
It's harder for me! I have those four other women to compete with!
Oh, is that why you did it the secret hallway where nobody ever goes?!
Oh, then you do know it. So um what kind of things do you write about?
Oh my God, he's gonna do it now. Please, I cannot watch this, let's go.
The guy who made these hates feet and wants to see them die!
Joey, did you even interview this woman before you asked her to move in?
Well yeah, but, you know, uh, 27 is a dangerous eye age.
Two it is. Ok, time for bed, I'm gonna go brush my teeth.
They've elected me to talk to you about the baby talk - it's not so good.
Hey Maureen! Gosh! Hey uh, Chandler? This is my cousin Maureen.
So that marriage stuff that you were saying yesterday, you don't really believe that do you?
Oh, that's because I had lunch with Rich-Me neither! Okay, what do I want now?
Oh, look! Acting for Beginners! Want to feel good about yourself?
That's it. I'm done. I don't care when the baby comes, no more betting.
Look, I-I'm never gonna let you up so you may as well just go away.
: sweetie it's ok, I still love you, let me be a part of this.
Oh, you came to tell him you love him! I knew it! I was right! I'm right, right?
Come on, okay, come on this is for all womankind. Let's kill 'um!
It's gonna be weird to watch some actor pretending to be Ben's dad.
Now there you go! I wouldn't want my best guest to strain her eyes!
Wow, Monica! What an amazing opportunity to influence... dozens of people.
I'm telling-If you put that in her apartment you'll never hear the end of it.
Okay, I'll rest. But y'know if I'm going to bed, then you're coming with me.
Well, do you think he was waiting 'til after you left, so he could cry?
I don't see him. Hey! Maybe he's in the sugar bowl! Joey? Nope!
Well, we thought we would all go to a picnic , in Central Park!
...in this day and age how dumb do you have to be to get pregnant?
Oh, Aunt Liddy's coming? That means we get five dollars each!
Y'know when I said to you earlier that I was at work umm, I'm at my new work.
Sure! It doesn't mean anything! Just like I know it doesn't mean anything with you!
Phoebe, it's okay that you don't want me to be your girlfriend because I have the best boyfriend.
Oh God Phoebe!! Oh that's it! That's it! Right there! Oh! Ooooh-oooh-ooooh...
I-I am serious, I mean, we're, we're all over each other all the time.
No I didn't, I said kiwi lime. That's what makes it so special.
Oh no! My parents have never seen me drunk! That they know of.
Listen...I need to know that what I'm about to ask you, will never get back to Chandler.
Y'see, this is where you'd use that 'hello' word we talked about.
Oh that's okay. Don't worry about it, you can give it to me when we get back.
I understand, but you're wishing for what we think you're wishing for, aren't you?
All right, that's it. You know what? Just get out of my way and stop moping.
Wow! A star! I know you all hate me and-and I'm sorry, but I don't care.
Hey, hold on there, tiger. How's it going? How you holding up?
Okay, one more, please. Come on, I'm gonna get it in this time, I will.
Hey Rach, come on! We're gonna be late for the eye doctor appointment!
Yeah, like I don't know, maybe you have a work problem that you need his advice on.
I'm gonna leave some cards here. Please think of us for you next event.
No, no really. I.. I wouldn't feel right about it. Just some water.
Hi Honey! We're all here; we just want to wish you a Merry Christmas.
OK, great. You'll tell us and we'll laugh. Let's play poker.
Well, with all these doctors and nurses, I'm gonna say, midget rodeo.
Wow! Play that message for Emily and this whole problem goes away!
Okay, but wouldn't it be easier if you had to tell me something that you could tell me.
Hey guys! Do you wanna look at the song list for the wedding? Guys?
No-no-no that was good, it was, that was uh, that was a goood kiss...
I'm just having one of those days where you realize you're in a dead-end relationship!
I know this is embarrassing, but nobody cares! No one here even knows you!
Hey, honey, my test is down the hall, are you sure you're going to be ok?
Vomit tux? Who vomited on-y'know what, what you up to Joe?
Oh my-This is so embarrassing. Oh my God, I'm never gonna get massaged again!
Well, now's a good time. I'm on my way to have my ears cut off.
You have to help me! I'm supposed to be writing my vows and all I have is this!
All right, well why don't I go out with an ex-boyfriend and do Joey a favor?!
Yes! All right, y'know what? Why don't we start with a practice run? Okay?
Oh my God! Did you hear that? She hired me because she thinks I'm good.
Oh! I hate that guy! I mean come on kid! Pull up your pants!
This is so unfair! She's got everything I want, and she doesn't have my mother.
Oh, you can't show Phoebe this! She hates those corporate massage chains.
Oh that's cute! We really all enjoyed it. But y'know, it doesn't count.
I have no idea, but X-rays alone could be a couple hundred dollars.
Look, I don't wanna do this test either, but I really do think it's a good idea!
No, my eye doctor is Richard! I can't go to him when I don't have a boyfriend!
You know what? This has been kind of a girlie day. You're right, I'm sorry.
Wait! Wait! Wait! You can't start today! Today's the rehearsal dinner!
What?! Are you kidding me?! You-you-you think we're ready to have a baby now?!
Oh, Nancy Thompson from Phoebe's old massage place is getting fired.
Oh my God! Joey, what did you do after you threw her leg on the fire?
I gotcha. Sorry. So, did you ever make him throw up a whole anything?
Oh that's my doodle of a ladybug, with a top hat. She's fancy.
Alright, here we go. We've got salmon roulettes and assorted crudites.
I'm glad you're here, we have a couple of things to ask you about the wedding ceremony.
Oh! And don't let me leave without getting the name of that carpet guy.
Ooh, these tennis shoes are so tight. I think I'll take them off.
Uh, listen, I need that broiling pan that Joey borrowed the other day.
I know that you're new at this, but this is completely unacceptable bath decorum.
All right, hand me that other box of photos; that's the very last one.
Chandler, listen to me sweetie, I know you can do this. Okay? You have a beautiful smile.
Well, it doesn't really matter ... you're both wishing for the same thing, right?
Ross used to stay up every Saturday night to watch Golden Girls!
Oh my God! No wonder I get such great service at Cafe Maurice.
You were the next caller five hours ago. You must be going crazy.
Yeah, I do think it's better this way. Yeah, we're being smart. Yes, I'm sure.
It wasn't funny at all! Why would you do that? Why didn't you pick me?
Do you want me to cry? Is that what you want? Do you wanna see me cry?
Well, he told me he was going out with the guys, I just didn't know that you were the guys.
Yeah, a-a-and clean. Not just health department clean... Monica clean.
Mira, Ross, Marcel se llevo el control remoto.
Hey, maybe I'll drive you up there! I'd like to buy some tickets myself!
"Oh my God, I love Ross! I hate Ross! I love Ross! I hate Ross!"
Now you think I wouldn't enjoy that, because it is so fake, but I still do.
Ohhh! No! This is my friend Rachel, we went to High School together.
Joey, this is sick, it's disgusting, it's, it'snot really true, is it?
Here's the plan! Okay? I'm going to leave you get a look at Brenda's bra!
Oh God! He's gonna come by and borrow some candles for his big date!
Let me put it this way. We're having sex whether you're here or not.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Phoebe. It's just a little shorter than what we had discussed.
How cool is this?! We know three down! I'm touching three down!
Ross's apartment is nice! How come we don't hang out here more often?
Ice, ice, ice squares anyone? Take a napkin. Alright.
Ok..You know the old classics you know,You look nice? They're still ok.
Chandler! I have to tell you, you smell so smokey I have to get up. I'm not kidding.
It's my new perfume. Why don't you come closer where you can really appreciate it?
Danny? You know Rachel? She's nice. She's not bad to look at, right?
ooohh... hey! Wanna stick around and I'll whip you up some dinner?
I'm sick of the signs! It's too fast, I'm happy the way things are!
But what kind of a sick bastard wants to do it in front of a deer?
...They threw us out! I was thrown out of a hotel! Me!
Ohh, I've always wanted to go to this culinary fair that they have in Jersey!
You know what probably happened? Someone musta stolen my credit card.
Oh, what a great gift! Is The Way You Look Tonight on it?!
Okay! There's only one left, three letter word, not dog but...
The basket is totally empty! My God, the neighbors ate all the candy!
What?! Why? Why is this crazy? So this isn't the ideal way to something....
They wouldn't have put it there if it didn't do something! How can you not care?
So you wanna tell us now, or are we waiting for four wet bridesmaids?
Wow, that is a surprise. Just one little question, uh, why not Ross's room?
Rose Marie really belongs on a smaller screen, doesn't she?
Hey. So um, I was thinking that maybe we should start dividing up our stuff.
Good, so do it Saturday night because we're going to dinner with her and Clark.
Now are drawers will smell nice and we didn't waste these pantyhose.
Chandler, this is not our problem. We've got each other. That's all that matters.
Maybe Joey doesn't have to give you the money, TV stars have assistants right?
Bye! Ten bucks says, I never see that woman again in my life.
See what happens when you give people advice? I hope you told him not to?
Come on! Come on! Hurry! We're running out of time! Huddle up!
Oh my God! A friend he's looking at differently, but it's wrong. It's Rachel!
I do! I'm a professional chef! Oh relax! It's not a courtroom drama!
No. I think we learned that from the sugarlips incident. I'm gonna get some tea.
The second sister dies in Archie and Jughead Double Digest?
You! It's not like it's a big deal! You-you don't still do it or anything!
Do you remember that jacket that you love so much, that you thought was too expensive?
Rachel, I need to borrow-You're not packed!!!! You're not packed even a little bit!
So umm, when I was in the shower I was thinking about our first night in London...
I guess with you doing the internship, we're just spending more than we're bringing in.
Oh! You assume because I was heavy that's the only way I could win something?
Oh, you're so sweet. Oh, but wait, what about our, what about the future and stuff?
Hey Rach, a guy from Ralph Lauren called, you got a second interview!
They're all in there! Even these five that I hid in my bra ...
Yeah, can we go call them? Is it too soon to call? I wanna call.
Y'know what? It really creeps me out choosing other people's sex clothes.
Okay. I'm gonna be the mom that makes the world's best chocolate chip cookies.
Remember that guy that gave me a bad review? Well... I'm getting my revenge!
Honey, you've been really strong about this, I know how badly you wanted that job.
This was fun! But I've got an invasive vaginal exam to get to!
'Cause if you do that means you'd be cancelling it for me, and we're just friends.
All right, you're telling me you can eat an entire turkey in just one sitting?
Why, it's dinner for six. 5 steaks, and an eggplant for Phoebe.
Okay, I'd like to know how much the room was because I'd like to pay my half.
Well, y'know how I always wanted to go out with Chip Matthews in high school?
Yeah, come on, eat, whatever you want. Dr. Roger got beeped again.
You're wrong! The centerpieces are fine! Do you ever get scared at all?
Chandler could you at least send some women to my party? Alright that's Ross.
So I don't have to sing and I can just sit there and pass judgments on others?
Oh, we were playing "peek-a-boo." She just - she loves it when I'm dramatic.
All right, I know you're hurting, and-and I want to be supportive, but don't say that again.
You're not gonna go anywhere, you said you were gonna eat here, and you're gonna eat here!
I'm telling you, something's wrong! My brother does not stay out all night.
Maybe I can try at intermission? Phoebe, come on... you know what? Let's just go!
Hello Dan! I'm really looking forward to Saturday night! Really, really!
Since we've been going out, I think I've mentioned his name twice!
They all came from the list you handed out to us two weeks ago.
Couldn't you just stay like this forever? Chandler! Couldn't you just stay here forever?
And what if I was still fat? Well, you wouldn't be dating me, that's for sure.
I mean, I realize that his feelings may never completely go away, but you can.
You had sex in his chair?!... I said that a little too loudly, didn't I?
Well fine! I want to meet this chicken expert! Send the Colonel in!
Really? Wow! It looks like I had some trouble staying inside the lines.
So you can't lose, it's there in the title. Wonderfullness is baked right in.
Oh no-no-no, stay, stay, stay, just keep talking. I'm always the hostess.
Uh, ah. Unless you wanna stay over? I mean, I'm going to, so...
How about you go put on your 007 tuxedo and I'll make you a nice martini.
All right look, if I take Chandler out of the running will you be able to focus?
In the beginning where y'know it's all sex and talking and sex and talking and...
I got it! How about, if we win, they have to get rid of the rooster?
What are you talking about? She just invited him to the biggest party of the millennium!
Ok worse case scenario is...we borrow some money from my parents.
Because that's where the party is you goon. See this is just the staging area.
It meant nothing! Okay? After all this time, how can you not trust me?
Now see, this way you protect the plate.. and lets face it you have fun.
Probably the only time I'll ever say this, but did you see the ass on her?
Rachel, what are you doing? Its freezing out here. Would you come back inside?
: OK... Dear Ms. Green... yeah... yeah... yeah... No.
OK, I'll go. OK, senior year of college... on a pool table.
Cowboy boots? I've never worn cowboy boots in my whole life!
Well, y'know I-I-I think I'm gonna respect the privacy of my new secret boyfriend.
Pheebs, you remember how we talked about saying things quietly to yourself first?
I'm gonna go put my make up on, we have to be at the hotel in an hour!
Hi. We checked the third and fourth floor, no-one's seen Marcel.
And you've never been funnier. Joke, joke, joke, you were a hoot!
I can't believe she's gonna say yes to David. She's clearly in love with Mike.
Went down to the docks. Bet ya didn't know you could get it wholesale.
I don't understand, I mean am I so hard to live, is this why I don't have a boyfriend?
What? We took a walk, nothing happened. I can back with nothing all over me.
I don't know! Time to kiss a guy maybe?! What are you laughing at Pampers?
Okay, I'm next. Don't! Don't start another game! I said I'm next! Phoebe!
All right. We're gonna go. It's not for another six hours. We're gonna go then.
What?! You paid a thousand dollars for a cat when you owe me 300!!
I just-I can't believe that you think that you and Chandler know me and Rachel better than we know you.
Baddest. Otherwise the song would be Fat Fat Leroy Brown.
I... I'm sorry, did you say something? I can't hear through all this damned hair!
Okay well, then we'll both do it today and he'll just have to deal with it!
You wanna go right now? 'Cause I'll take you right now, buddy! You wanna go?
You know, when you start get screwed over all the time, you gotta switch to low-fat.
I think his begging days are over now that he's going out with Nancy Branson.
Olivia? I thought she was marrying Connor! Oh right, real life more important.
Phoebe, he's a friend of my parents. He's like 20 years older than me.
Ohh, Please?! I'm a single mom, with a thirty year old son!!
Yeah! Okay, this one is a mushroom cap. Umm, this one is made of bologna.
I'm gonna go into the bathroom so I can look at it in the mirror, as I eat it.
Yes! Now, they're a little more than I normally spend on boots...or rent
Alright, I'll give you the ear thing but don't you think the ending was pretty wonderful?
Don't worry Joe, I won't come next year! Joey: What have you got there?
It's a dead dog. That's Chi-Chi; she died when I was in high school.
All right, he's keys are in the drawer. Y'know what? I also need some cash.
Sorry. But I kind of have this feeling that we may have made a baby last night.
Okay. Man, I have not made this many cookies since I was in the ninth grade.
Ok, everybody, there's food and drinks on the table. Go across the hall.
First of all um, I love you both so much and you're both so important to me...
Okay, but there is a wire back there! I mean that switch is connected to something!
Do this for me! Come on, I catch you looking at woman's breasts all the time!
: maybe I will go yea will have a second honeymoon at the Tulsa romana.
Rachel-Rachel-Rachel I-I cannot, I can't let-, actually I kinda want to see what happens.
Hey! Mrs. Altman was the kind of woman you could tell she used to be pretty.
Yeah with Chandler not getting paid, we could really use 300 million dollars.
Chandler! Okay, let me get this straight, it's okay for you to flirt, but not for me.
OK, we done with the chit-chat? Are we ready to play some serious poker?
Hello! Were we at the same table? It's like... cocktails in Appalachia.
Sandra, I am so sorry, I thought you were Rachel and we just weren't ready for you yet.
You're not dressed yet?! We're supposed to start having fun in 15 minutes!
Honey, what is the Bruce Springsteen CD in the Kat Stevens case?
Nooo! No, that's not true. No, best time ever! Yeah, you rocked me world!
Come on! Come on, it'll be fun! It'll make me feel so much better.
Al-alright, l-look you guys, this is the best relationship I've been in. . .
What the... Yes you're too late! Where was all this three years ago?!
That's a good idea! I bet they have one of those wind machines! Y'know...
C'mon. Keeps his fingers to himself and he's always minty fresh.
Honey, you made the bed again. I told you, you don't have to do that. This isn't camp.
Well, doing nothing on your thirtieth is better than doing something stupid, like Ross.
Well, she was shocked when I told her, but then again so were most people.
Just go up to her and ask her out. Oh, what's the worst thing that could happen?
Oh my god! Did you hear that? She said Monica! Oooh, I can't leave her!
Okay fine! Fine! Then you know what, I'll just write about Phyllis! Hmm!
Yeah. All right, I'm gonna go tell Dan that it's not gonna happen. Don't do the dance.
Chinadolor Bong, come on, we steal that TV Guide every week!
I still say that if we had called your dad we coulda gotten better seats.
Oh, wow, so you're gonna be one of those "healthy, healthy, healthy guys"?
Yes, because all good plans start with, "I'll go down the fire escape."
So look umm, while we're st-still in London, I mean, we can keep doing it right?
Wait, no-no-no, I can go really fast! Dad, give me the keys to your Porsche!
What? You freak! You wouldn't even have known about this place if it wasn't for me!
Well, it was the first time. Y'know, there's not always a lot of agreement the first time.
What Phoebe meant to say was umm, how come you're having a party and we're not invited?
You obviously haven't screwed over a lot of your friends. Which we all appreciate.
Oh, honey!I can't. I was just telling these guys that things are crazy at the restaurant!
Did I miss it? Rachel, I-I want you to know that, if it's positive, we're gonna...
Guys! Guys! I just saw two people having sex in a car right outside.
Oh wait, just one more thing! One more minute! Umm, you're a stupid bitch.
What?! I didn't take care of everything, there's-there's plenty of things for you to do!
You, and you, you're supposed to be at my party. And Gunther! What are you doing here?
All right fine, your guy may have a great body, but our guy is really funny.
Yeah, I've just been fiddling around in here making delicious treats for everyone.
That's Mindy? Wow, she is pretty. Lucky. To have had a friend like you.
See there you go. Woo! We're out of the woods. Okay, I'll get dressed now.
All right. Tell me if this is too cute. Lesbian wedding, chicken breasts.
Really? Cause I'd need like $500 for all the food and the supplies and stuff.
Oh, Rachel, sweetie, look, here's a really cute picture of Joey and you at the reception.
Mrs. Bing? Here, these are my parents umm, Judy and Jack Geller.
Oh he's nice. He's nice! Y'know, you always stick up for the people we fog!
Oh hey Joey! We've been watching all day, when are you gonna be on TV?
Okay, good, 'cause umm, well maybe we could have a little workout of our own...
Really? Okay, so why don't you tell me what happened to Ross Junior year at Disneyland?
Oh yes, it is. I'm sorry I borrowed it, I was cold. I hope its okay?
Yeah I can! And don't think I don't, because I do! I mean all the time, you betcha!
No, no, wait. His flight doesn't leave for another forty-five more minutes.
Ok who thinks the food is delicious and a little pretention never hurt anyone?
Hi, come in! Paul, this is.. ... everybody, everybody, this is Paul.
Look, if you want you can keep it at our place until you find out what to do with it.
Phoebe knows and she's just trying to freak us out! That's the only explanation for it!
No, Phoebe, I'll tell you what, if you get ready now I'll let you play it at the wedding.
Well, I'm gonna fill in for him as food critic for the Chelsea Reporter.
Yes! Maybe it's a false positive. Are you sure you peed on the stick right?
All right, y'know what? We really are late! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!!
Yeah that, plus his mom used to put sour cream on everything!
All right, but if-if he lights someone else on fire he is out of there!
Ugh, I knew giving you that book was gonna come back and bite me in the ass!
Okay well then, I'll fire him today and you go out with him for another week.
Okay, maybe people give out fake numbers, but they don't give out fake names.
Yeah. I mean it was kinda fun for a while, but didn't you start feeling silly?
Yeah, and in the long version, I dump him for telling people the short version.
Chandler there's nothing wrong with crying! I mean you don't have to be so macho all the time.
Daddy! I don't think we need to hear about the specific positions you and mom had sex.
I can't believe we've never done this before! It's sooo good! So good for Monica!
Okay, we have a lot of options here, a number of prototypes for you to try on.
Okay, now that everything's wrapped up here, I think I'm, I'm gonna go do my laundry.
But Phoebe, you can go out with a creepy guy any night of the year. I know I do.
Thank you! 2nd Customer: It was. The duck in particular was superb.
It was okay. She's still kind of depressed because she broke up with her boyfriend.
Okay, umm-umm, I'll just--I'll be right back, I just gotta go ah, go ah...
Wow! That Mike thing was interesting! I don't know what's gonna happen with Phoebe and David.
Just breathe, breathe.. that's it. Just try to think of nice calm things...
Rachel, say that I'm friends with her, we spend some time together. Is that so terrible?
Uh Tim? This is Phoebe. Phoebe this is Tim, my new sous chef.
No Chandler no! No unscheduled stops. You can go when we stop for gas.
I know being spit on is probably not what you need right now. Um... how long?
Doesn't it ever just freak you out that-that you're never gonna be with anybody new again?
Oh, absolutely. Yeah, you know I'm not even thinking about that thing that we're not supposed to think about.
We are the hottest! Huh? No one is hotter than we are! You're the best.
Uh Rachel? Rachel, why don't you sit here? And Will you sit way over there.
Remember that guy from cooking school I told you about that put cilantro with everything?
Yeah you will! The right guy is just around the corner! Okay, are we done with that?
That's because he wasn't invited because of the way he behaved at our engagement party.
I don't know how museums work in England but, here, you're not supposed to take stuff.
No, of course not. It's not even an issue. Cause I told him I was 22.
Oh, really? So why was I busting my ass to make this delicious Thanksgiving dinner?
Ok, I don't wanna be negative so I'll say that most of the signs you bought are good.
Wow! That's great! Dad must really like you, he doesn't ask just anyone to play.
You can't fire me. I make your decisions and I say, "I'm not fired!" Ha!
Is it like for dinosaur emergencies. 'Help, come quick, they're still extinct.'
Well maybe we can make a, a, a 'B' out of one of those roses.
This is me in The Sound of Music. See the von Trapp kids?
Oh. I guess you can. Okay but; I-I have to return it, so you can't like it.
He's got something plastic lodged in his throat, we've got to go to the hospital.
Jean-Claude Van Damme. I didn't know he was in this movie, he is so hot.
I know. I just wish that once, I'd bring a guy home that they actually liked.
You know, I knew a girl in high school who did that. She was very popular.
Well uh, you and I are just goofing around, I thought, why not goof around with him.
Honey, having a heart attack is nature's way of telling you to slow it down.
What do you want me to do? Just sit here silently while you three have a conversation?
Oh no, I already packed. The only thing I couldn't find though was your Speedo.
That's okay, this is more important than fruit on my ceiling! You broke up?!
Oh gosh, listen if you and Chip do it tonight, promise me you'll tell me everything.
Wait a minute. Are you honestly telling me that-that you may never want to get married?
Chandler, umm, I want you to take just a minute and I want you to think about how ridiculous this sounds.
Yeah. I bet you can't guess what color my tonsils are? I'll bet the apartment!
Hey. Ross, did you know Mom and Dad are going to Puerto Rico for Thanksgiving?
Well, I-I-there was this guy at the bank that I thought was cute umm, but I don't anymore.
Because, you were mean to me and you, you teased me and you always, always got your way.
Yeah. Hey, that was nice of you guys to back off and let Joey get the girl for once.
A salad? Really I, I could do something a little more complicated if you like.
It's supposed to be that small. It's a pre-appetizer. The French call it an amouz-bouche.
Hold it! Are you talking about Dick Clark's New Year's Rocking Eve?
I think so. Se, he-he's not inviting you to his party because he likes you.
Look, I know that I should've told them. I know I shouldn't care what they think. I'm sorry.
I-It's just so insulting! Big spring for a new blank tape, Doctor!
This is crazy! I mean, it's such a stupid argument. I don't even wanna see Richard again.
Phoebe! But I could take one of those little feet and put it in a pita pocket.
She pulled it out of me! She's like a conversational wizard! How'd it go?
No-no, I-I just, I liked them so much that I went out and bought some for myself.
But still, it's a big change. The end of an era, you might say!
Okay, ooh, alright. Name, address... Okay, in case of emergency, call?
He had to go, there's a deer just outside eating fruit from the orchard.
Yeah, I'll be fine. You know, maybe I'll stay here and practice the art of seduction.
Joey is having a secret Days Of Our Lives party up on the roof!
Chandler, please! Do you know how unbelievably glad I am that Joey was not there that night?!
Of course I have! What do you think, I'm some 30 year old virgin?
The babies are asleep, I'm sure you'll be okay on your own for a while!
Wait. Rachel, no, he's married. Married! If you don't realize that, I can't help you.
Well, you broke up with Julie Grath! How much weight could she have gained?
Ross let me ask you a question. All jokes aside, where is this relationship going?
I said we are not going to do it, okay? Sometimes you can be such a, a big baby.
Ah, it's an honest mistake. It could happen to anyone. All right, see ya.
Hey Gunther. Hi. I mean you're going out on a date with the noisy guy upstairs?
I'm not sick!! I don't get sick! Getting sick is for weaklings and for pansies!
Well I guess there is no harm in telling you now, Rachel and Ross are gonna have a baby.
Oh my God, can you believe we are surrounded by all this? I can barely control myself.
Some people have been saying its y'know little drops of heaven, but whatever.
Oh my God! She's amazing. Oh, oh I'm so glad you guys got drunk and had sex!
Wow, you seem to be doing so much better. That's great. So how-how are things going?
I can't believe Joey's having lunch with his stalker. What i-, what is she like.
I swear I didn't know she was a hooker! I mean wh-Did you let her smoke in here?
I'm sorry, okay? It just-tonight was supposed to be y'know, it was supposed to be a big deal.
All right, you just make sure that Chandler catches the ball, I'll take care of the rest.
Wait a minute, are you doing Joey's "Audition didn't go so well. Yeah it did?"
Oh because it doesn't...really fit. Oh by the way, I-I booked the Swing Kings.
You're so pathetic! Why can't you just accept it, we're winning because I'm better than you.
My boots in tan! Hey! Can you get a little closer so I can see the price?
With a wok? I thought you were going to read my boring book to put you asleep.
Don't worry Phoebe, you're gonna meet someone. If I can meet a great guy, so can you.
Well that's it. People never say `We need to talk' unless it's something bad.
I don't know! Why don't you just explain? What do they want? Find out what they want!
That is so sweet. I know that I was acting a little crazy but umm, I feel the same way.
Oh yeah? Well when you learned how to dance did you forget how to put on underpants?
Joey, I left my watch on the counter last night. It was right here, where is it?
I can't get married until I get something old, something new, something borrowed, and something blue.
No you're not. You're, you're allergic to lobster and peanuts and--oh my god.
What's the big deal with her? Maybe she's attractive in an obvious kind of way.
That's right. My Mom doesn't have any faith in me! Oh, that's hilarious! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.
No, I want you to have a job that you love. Not statistical analysis and data reconfiguration.
Yes, thank you so much. And again, we're so sorry. We could not feel worse about it.
Okay. That's okay. I-I know that you're very upset right now. I know, I know that wasn't about me.
No! But, I'm throwing this shirt away! I think there was a little misunderstanding before.
Okay fine! I keep betting Phoebe that you're gonna have the baby and I don't want to lose again!
Does it have to do with-with Chandler and that sock that he keeps by his bed?
Are you insane? I mean Joey, is going to kill you, he's actually going to kill you dead.
: what's the big deal, you forgot, she forgot, maybe you were having an off night.
It's just that he doesn't have that much free time, ya know, and I don't know, what do I do?
So do you guys gonna come over tomorrow? I'll make that pasta thing I was telling you about.
Because, honey, I mean this in the sweetest way possible, nobody is gonna wanna watch that.
Wait, you can't have the baby here! I mean I haven't sterilised it since the guys moved out!
I'm so sorry that you had to find out this way. I'm sorry, but it's true, I love him too.
Rachel, what's going on? I mean isn't this the same Barry who you left at the altar?
I would love too, but I can't! I mean I just can't, you know that I'm not good at confrontation.
Honey. Uh, not to sound too Florence Henderson but, dinner's on the table.
What is it with you people! I mean, the minute you start to feel something, you have to run away?
Y'know what, I think we should play a game. I mean come on, it's been twelve years.
Well, no, not at all, you're not terminal, you just, you just need some damage control.
Ha,ha, ha, oh my life is just so amusing. Could we drop it now?
What? So you guys don't mind going out with someone else who's going out with someone else?
Hey, guess what I'm doing this weekend! I'm going to this culinary fair in New Jersey.
Oh, I've got it! I have got it! Pictures from your childhood. This will get you going good!
...And then we throw your body in the water... Gee, that does sound fun.
Well uh, you and I are just goofing around, I thought, why not just goof around with him.
Why would I care where Chandler is? You know uhh...You know sometimes I don't even like Chandler.
Wait, was this a-a small mediterranean guy with curiously intelligent good looks?
So you're a little older. Try to look at the positive: You have all this life experience.
Here's your key. All right, you have to christen it! Now, go out and come back in!
I told you you were a bath person! Hey, when you get out, maybe I can give you a facial!
Then you'd be going back and forth all the time, I mean it doesn't make any sense.
He wanted to tell me he's gonna compete is some ultimate fighting competition thingy.
Oh man! If I had known I was coming to this party I never would have gotten married!
Thank you. So what does this Bob guy look like? Is he tall? Short?
He's not great umm, but he's dealing with it. Oh wait a minute, you're not gonna try...
Oh no it's not, no it's not. It's a first date. I'm sure that nothing is gonna...
Well uh, I'm trying to make something for Joey. Do you mind if I raid your fridge?
Well it's...I mean I'd just-I'd be self-conscious. You're my friend; I'd be naked.
Phoebe, you got Joey drums to annoy Rachel, so she wouldn't wanna live there anymore?
Wait. Rachel, no, he's married. Married! If you don't realise that, I can't help you.
What?! Come on I am tough! Punch me right here! As hard as you can!
Phoebe! I have to have those earrings, we're going to leave as soon as the show is over.
So! So we've got to go upstairs and have a lot of sex to prove them wrong!
Alright, I tell you what, I'll give this to you now if you can tell me where we keep the dustpan.
Whatever Ross! Just replace the bulbs in the brake lights after you're done.
How about if I dance around all covered in sauce? Huh? You think it's funny now?
Oh, I'd like a latte. Oh y'know what? If you're gonna talk about me, I'm gonna go with you.
Chandler, there is nothing in there that concerns you! If you love me you-you'll let it go.
Man, man that is sharp. It must have cost you quite a few debloons.
Did you like her? And I'm just asking as a friend, because I am totally fine with this.
Well, honey, it is pretty competitive. I mean I've got an actual rocket scientist here.
Well, I did one time, and-and I want to start doing it more. See that's what this is about.
Hey, look at me. I'm making jam, been at it since 4 o'clock this morning.
My God, Rachel, I can't believe Phoebe made out with Ralph Lauren. Ohh, I'm so jealous.
Y'know what, this is obviously some kind of twisted joke she's trying to play on him.
I know, but now we have this second one and it just, it feels like it's snowballing, y'know?
All right people listen, I've got exactly twenty-eight minutes before I have to baste again.
See? Ben doesn't think you're a loser, he thinks you're a cowboy! Now that's something.
Alright, before I tell you, uh, why don't you tell me how many women you've been with.
No. Big deal, so you have a side of the bed, everybody has a side of the bed.
Y'know if it's any consolation, he really did sound like he was having more fun with you.
Find some! Please! Anything that doesn't say I-I died tragically in France.
You heard the woman. Peel, chop, devil! I can't believe I lost 2 minutes.
Well, are you asleep right now, Joe? 'Cause I don't think you have to wear it unless you are!
Okay. Phoebe that's it. Come on, get out-out of the chair. Get out! Oh come...Phoebe!
Okay. I'm guessing that if you don't want to deliver, you probably don't want to pick stuff up either.
Well you let me know if you can, because y'know I can bake a pie to cover it.
No. Um, I know you like this, and I want you to have it. I think it'll look good in our apartment.
Y'know, I don't have an appointment, but I sure could use a physical. Are you sure you're okay?
I can't do it. I'm sorry, I wish I could, but umm, see you have these feelings for me....
I know what you need, you need a bodyguard. Hey Ross, what is Ben doing after preschool?
Ugh, y'know, umm we gotta get up early and catch that plane for New York.
Joey, what are you doing? You promised Phoebe you wouldn't eat meat until she has the babies!
Okay, so it doesn't involve Ross or Rachel or Chandler or Joey. But, what about Pete?
Oh, will you do the top of the cabinets? That'll really work up your appetite for lunch.
No, I know. But y'know what? It would make me feel better if Lewis apologized to me.
Well, if you had kept listening, you-you would have heard me call him Mr. Big......ot.
Wow, come in, have a seat. You must be exhausted coming all the way from...Texas.
Um, you guys, you know when I said before, "thank you, but I don't really need your help"?
Ok, um so, I still have to invite Dillon and Emma and Shannon Cooper.
Listen, we don't have to make that a guest room, we can think of something to do with the room together.
Hey, don't say that! You got just as good a chance as anybody else of getting that job!
Oh, that's Nana, right there in the middle. 'Me and the gang at Java Joe's'.
We were, we were just in the storage area and we saw this really creepy man!
I know, I've been looking at those doors, they look pretty sound proof, don't you think?
Yeah... ..see, I was supposed to get married, but, um, I left the guy at the altar.
Oh, that's great! I mean I'm-I'm sorry, but I'm so happy for you. And now I can work for you!
Wait a minute. That wasn't a hard eight! Last night I rolled a hard eight.
Yeah, y'know I-I made a commitment to you. Y'know what, it'd be, it'd be fun.
I don't know, maybe. I mean I'm dating a man who's pool I once peed in.
My brother, the PhD would like to know if there's any way to treat this orally.
Hmm, care to make it interesting? I'll bet you that she'll have it by this time tomorrow.
Wait-wait, guys! If-if we follow the rules, it's still fun and it means something!
Really? I'm perfectly comfortable. Hey, hey, hey, get in line buddy, I was next.
All right ah, Ross, this is the extent of my knowledge on the subject. Call Rachel.
Can I ask you guys a question? D'you ever think that Alan is maybe.. sometimes..
Yeah, I talked to you on the phone, I'm the lady that got stuck with the racecar bed.
I'm on top of the world, looking down on creation and the only explanation I can find...
So how does this work, you going to balance the plates on these little guys' heads?
Let's just do it right now. Okay? It won't be hard. Just say what's in your heart.
Oh-ho! But not in here! Can't eat 'em in bed, remember? No crumbies!
If someone wants to give us a present, we don't want to deprive them of that joy.
This is a garden view room, and we paid for an ocean view room.
Oh my God! We love that show! I mean Ross and I have been watching it since I can remember!
Hey! Oh, I'm so glad you're home, I thought tonight we could finally organize these photos!
Ross, come sign this birthday card for dad. Rich is gonna be here any minute.
Okay, listen, there's still some of Chandler's medicine under the sink in the bathroom. Bye!
Oh, I'm sorry. Of course I mean that. Interesting idea, umm, talk about it, but no.
We got out pictures back from London. Here's all of us at the Tower of London.
It's almost 8 o'clock, it's almost past his bedtime. Where-where is he?
My Sweet Sixteen! Remember, you went to third base with my cousin Charlie.
No, I've had second thoughts about that. Do you realize how hard that would be to clean?
Could you guys please try to keep it down, we're trying to start a Boggle tournament.
Okay, I'm sorry. I think I can walk the rest of the way now. Just-just give me my boots.
But the minute we start to lie to each other... And by 'we' I mean society.
No, there is no way! It can not be Ross! Unbelievable! Why is your family Scottish?!
Get all freaked out because everybody was talking and just joking around about marriage and stuff.
She's a hooker! She's a hooker! She's a... Hi! Uh, we spoke on the phone.
Well, an-anyway, I just-that night meant a lot to me, I guess I'm just trying to say thanks.
Well that's because you always sleep to noon, silly! This is what 9 looks like.
I don't, I just, I just like the smell of them. So, uh, what are you really doing here Dad?
Oh my God! Look at all the newspapers! It must be a good review! Is it great?!
They love each other, and they wanna celebrate that love with the people that are close with them.
Alright, well, maybe I should let you and the second prettiest girl in Oklahoma get back to work.
My brother's going through that right now, he's such a mess. How did you get through it?
Mom and dad just sent me in here to find out if you were trying to get Ross stoned!
You're supposed to find your passion in life. You can be whatever you wanna be now. It's exciting.
Okay, fine I admit it! I feel terrible! Would you please rub this on my chest?
Am I doing here? Why? Surprised to see me? Ross brought me. How do you like that?!
The woman that got married a bunch of times and killed herself when you were 13?
You know, that's true. You'd be a great person to have around the day after an emergency.
Hey Ross, maybe if your skin was lighter. Your teeth wouldn't look so bright.
I cant believe you. You still havent told that girl she doesnt have a job yet?
Wasn't it a lot more exciting when we were y'know all over each other all the time?
I was just saying that because I was ovulating and you said you wouldn't have sex with me while we're fighting.
Remember back in freshman year? Well, Billy Dreskin and I had sex on your bed.
Okay, I've got a question. If you had to pick one of us to date, who would it be?
So how you doing today? Did you sleep okay? Talk to Barry? I can't stop smiling.
Well, well Ross didn't care enough to be here, so I think he's out. You snooze you lose.
I thought it might be true. And I was afraid that you were gonna cry and then show it to me.
Okay, he's a lawyer, who teaches sculpting on the side. And- he can dance!
Wow, for a guy who's recently lost his job, you're in an awfully good mood.
Is-is-is that message old or new? Old or new?! Old or new?!
Sounds like you need to think about what you want, talk to Gavin, and you definitely should talk to Ross.
Guys, could you please just stop throwing the ball for one minute and just help me find it!
Yes. Yes, I was. A guy. From work. I'm seeing a guy from work! Ha!
You do know that was me who just said that right? Hey. As long as we're both up...
Okay, now this one is rare, this one is medium well! Now go-go-go! Hey Phoebe!
Do I go horseback riding in the park? Do I take classes at the New School?
It's a stupid game and I wasn't playing against other people, so technically I didn't lose.
Nope, sound like me. Pheebs, it's going great. Look at Chandler with little baby girl Chandler.
Hey Tim? I need a calamari and a Caesar salad. And umm, could you get me the pesto?
Okay. Okay, I got one. Do you remember that vegetarian pate that I made that you loved so much?
Mom's here? I wanted to have lunch with her today, she told me she was out of town.
So big deal, so Joey's had a lot of girlfriends, it doesn't mean he's great in bed.
Ross is really strong! Okay, he's the strongest out of all three of you! Except for Joey.
Yeah-Oh that's right. You, you always wanted me too. Hey, I see you got your mustache back.
Oh. Thank you. Ohhh, thank you very much. Oh, thank you for coming. Uh, just a second!
Rachel, I have not missed one question the whole game. I own this game! Look at my hand.
Honey, thanks for trying to figure out a way, but if you're going to Tulsa, I wanna go with you.
Ok! When I go places with high humidity, it gets a little extra body, ok?!
And for our two-week anniversary, he's gonna take me to his cousin's cabin for the weekend.
Look, I don't even know how I feel about him yet. Just give me a chance to figure that out.
You wanna meet some people? This is uh; this is my husband Chandler. Chandler, this is Will.
I can't believe it! She's asleep! I got her to go to sleep! I have actual magical powers!
Y'know what? I'm gonna make this up to you. I promised you a stripper , and you're gonna get a stripper.
Oh, by the way. Would it be okay if I gave the toast to mom and dad this year?
I promise. Hey, speaking of together, how about we send out a holiday card this year?
: Is this not the good part? Do you want me to fast forward to something a little toothier.
Look, guys, you can't do this, it's just going to make getting over each other, that much harder.
Yeah, well I might be if I had the supplies! I mean, I could do all this stuff. Only I don't.
I think it's a great idea. Yeah, we could have a dinner party and just invite her close friends.
I can't wait to be with you! I'll just tell Rachel I'm gonna be doing laundry for a couple of hours.
Come on Rach, come on. Let's see what's it like to be on a winning team for a change.
Okay, those people just left, come on! Quick! Give him the money and get their table!
Come on. Hello? I'm sorry you have the wrong number. Okay, I'll call you later dad. I love you.
Hold on a second, just put a little club soda on it and it should umm, be.....
Perhaps, you would like me to turn like this, so that you can bunny bump against my back.
Yeah but it was because I-I had an eye exam and I don't like my new eye doctor.
Umm, when I said that uh, that Chandler and I wanted to umm, live together we meant alone together.
What you guys don't understand is, for us, kissing is as important as any part of it.
Y'know, in my defense, umm there was no glitter on the macaroni and very little glue.
Hello! Organic substances recently discovered in the depths of the rain forest!
Rachel, you can go down there, you don't have to smoke. Just say you wanna get some fresh air.
Chandler, wait. It goes: Old job, new job, you. This is just something I have to do.
Especially the after taste, you know, I'll tell ya, that'll last ya till Christmas.
: Honey look we can do something else, do you want me to get into the tub and thrash.
I just tell her, I have to get it over with. I told Ross and Phoebe and she's the only one left!
No, I don't even know how serious he is about me. Until I do, I'm not telling them anything.
Oh, he's sober alright. Just turns out that Fun Bobby was fun for a reason.
Unless... Maybe we do it here. I mean, how much can she even be aware of at this age?
Well Ross, you be careful now. You don't want to get a reputation as y'know Professor McNailshisstudents.
Thank you! You haven't said anything... 3rd Customer: Actually I do have one small complaint.
I hope by maid you mean mistress, because if some other woman was here cleaning then...
Okay, just wait, please. I promise we'll come up with something. Just give us a little more time.
Oh, you can have an accent and I can't?! Top 'O the morning to ya laddies!
Um, okay, here it goes. I'm not 22. I'm, I'm 25... and thirteen months.
Come on Chandler, come on, I can handle Ross. Hold on! Hey Ross. What's up bro?
Yeah, tacos! Ever since you told me that story I've had such a craving for them.
So, do you guys wanna come and eat dinner at the restaurant sometime in the next few weeks?
Oh, um, that was my bathing suit from high school. I was uh, a little bigger then.
Oh my God. You guys! You gotta come see this! There's some creep out there with a telescope!
This is for the scratchy twins out there. I taped oven mits to their hands.
Well, at least you're not hearing it for the first time at your fifth grade Halloween party.
No Chandler, you don't understand! Okay! Okay! Okay! Fine! Now you know. Okay? I'm y'know...I'm sick.
What?! I thought he'd love it! His favorite kid's book was the Velveteen Rabbit!
Umm, why don't you give me something that would be a good reason and-and then I'll tell you if it's true.
Phoebe! You're sick, you shouldn't play. You should just go home, get in bed, and stay there.
Oh, hi, Ross. Yeah. There's someone I want you to say hi to. He just happened to call.
Because your all gonna make up fake specials and make me cook them like you did the other night?
Yeah, but her plane got delayed in Athens. But actually, she should be here by now.
We should get over there and see if she's okay. Just one...second! Score! Game! Come on.
Honey, as we get closer to the wedding, is there anything that you would like to talk about or share?
Okay, but all right you're a guy, does it not freak you that you're never gonna sleep with anybody else?
Yes it is. You see I've always found the men's bathroom very sexual. Haven't you?
David, can you help me?! I'm trying to explain to Chandler how a plane stays in the air.
No you didn't. Oh and honey just so you know, now that you're marrying me, you don't get to win anymore.
Oh come on, it's only fair, you paid for the flight. Now is, is that enough lire?
Well, this is the last box of your clothes. I'm just gonna label it, "What were you thinking?"
Umhmm, umhmm, about the time you told me about New Year's Eve. Where is everybody else?
Well...honestly ever since we got engaged I have been waiting for something to, to flip you out.
I will! But not tonight. For dinner music, I thought we could listen to that tape you made me.
Yeah but see I have nothing to compare it too. So even if you're horrible, how would I know?
Y'know what shoes would look great with this ring? Diamond shoes! You're not getting dressed.
Wow! Wow! And it's definitely all gone? There's nothing there to work with? What were you thinking?
I think he is fine! It's just that we don't know anything real about him... we should get more information.
Anyway, I picked up this outfit that I want to wear and the, and the boots don't really go with it.
You're right. I mean I'm sorry. Yeah, I shouldn't be laughing. I should be laying down papers for you!
Well, the turkey's burnt. Potatoes are ruined, potatoes are ruined, potatoes are ruined.
Oh my God, my ass is sweating! Please! Please! Can you come? It's today at four.
And Dad, y'know that mailman that you got fired? He didn't steal your Playboys! Ross did!
Hi sweetie, look before I forget, did I leave my diaphram at your place? Hi mom.
Bouncy baby, Bouncy baby, Ooh baby baby, Ooh baby baby, Ooh baby baby.
Y'know what we should do? We should all get dressed up and go to have champagne at The Plaza.
Oh my God Stu! I-I can't believe you did this! Now are you absolutely sure she's a hooker?
Wait a minute, you got Ross Gellar and guest?! I wasn't invited and you got "and guest?!"
Hi, good morning lover. I gotta say after last night, I'm a little weak in the knees.
Now, most guys will hit uh, 1-2-3 and then go to 7 and set up camp.
All right. But umm, I-I-I'll pay you back all the money you invested, and you can keep the van.
It was, it was really nice. We started talking and I-I ended up having lunch with him.
Oh umm, how about your mom dying, or having to live on the streets when you were 14?
She's just upset because she, uh, she buttered a spider into her toast this morning.
They can't all be bad. Find the one where you make your bedroom eyes. Ohh, there it is.
So I hide in the shower and the next thing you know they're going at it right on the bathroom floor.
Oh my God. Wait a minute, I had them put... Oh my God! It's in the quiche! Oh My God!
Oh, so much fun. But the best part is, we met this incredible couple on the way back.
I can't believe you're dressing up for him. I mean, you're just, you're setting yourself up all over again.
They baked it. I can't take this anymore. I'm gonna call a meeting tonight, I'm gonna fire you tonight.
Okay. Wait, just give me a second, I need to just get my boots off first. Ah...Ooh...Oohh...Ohh...Oh God...Ohh...Oh...Ohh...Ohhhh...
Wow, so you guys are, you're never gonna be in the same room together? How is that even gonna work?
So what! As long as he's not wearing a white dress and a veil I don't care.
Okay, I'll be back in just a minute. Oh, Phoebe I'm sorry that I left lipstick marks on the phone.
So uh, Joey and Chanlder, I, I think it's time that you take Dr. Greene over to your place.
Yeah, well he's my brother! And plus he drives so slow he could never hurt it.
: yea well the weird part is... he was getting off to a shark attack show!
What about all the guys that you've got the phone numbers from? Why don't you just kiss one of them?
In one year?! My God what did she eat? Her-her family! That's not the point.
I hope you're hungry, we're starting with oysters. And y'know what they say about oysters, don't you?
How she drove you crazy, picking on every little detail, like your hair... for example.
We're supposed to uh, be spending a romantic weekend together, it-it, what is the matter with you?
Oh my God! That's great! Oh wow! You're a published writer! I wish I had a present for you!
Hey, waitwait, aren't you the guy that plays the butt in the new Al Pacino movie?
Ok, I'll tell you what. How about I cook dinner at my place? I'll make it just like Mom's.
I don't believe this! When someone asks you in for lemonade, and to you that means they wanna have sex?
You know what would be real weird? Is if you weren't there. Just say you'll think about it, okay?
Okay, guys! The candy is coming; I just need another 15 minutes for the chocolate to cool!
Oh, it was great! The widow wouldn't pay, so Phoebe yelled at her 'til she did.
All right! Let's go! Let's go Team Monica! All right, we can work out the name later.
Oh, what about that guy over there? Remember? That is the guy you flirted with at the counter that time.
Now I'm guessing that he bought her the big pipe organ, and she's really not happy about it.
You know, they're not actually supposed to have... I'll work on the lumps. Joey, you're going home, right?
Are you kidding?! I get a Porsche and the barca lounger's gone?! This is the best day ever!
Sweetie, with you it's gonna be different. The sex is gonna be great, 'cause you-you guys are in love.
Okay, look, I-I have enough stuff for one more sandwich, I mean I was going to eat it myself, but
When I fall asleep on the couch after reading, she covers me over with a blanket.
Come on guys! Suck it up! We're closing in on ten hours! It's gut-check time!
If it makes anybody feel better, then we can just forget the thing, and we'll just do the gift.
Yeah. I think you have to draw him out. And then- when you do- he's a preppy animal.
Just out. Had some lunch, just me, little quality time with me. Thanks for your jacket.
Wow, this is so weird. I just realized this might be the last time we'll all be hanging out together.
I just checked my messages, and he said that when he gets back from Atlanta, we need to talk.
Oh y'know what? If you're gonna be acting like this all night, I really, I don't even want to be around you.
Oh absolutely. I like it even more on you than I did on Colonel Sanders. Ross! Ross! I'm kidding!
Hey, what are you doing? You gotta save room, you've got almost an entire turkey to eat.
That was not an incident! I-I was gesturing, a-and the plate slipped out of my hand.
Rach, you're in a great place in your life. Come on, you've got a great job! Good friends...
So, Mr. Rastatter, what exactly does this job entail? The ad wasn't too clear.
Of course there's another guy!! This is even more perfect! Now you have to prove your love!
Well if Ted Kopel talked about his coworkers botched boob jobs, I would.
You bet that I'd screw up?! So all that stuff about hiring me because I was good was...
So I made snacks. Please, just hang out okay? I'm just gonna rest my eyes just a little bit.
No, it was Ginger. I remember, because when he told me, I said, 'the movie star.'
Can we turn the TV off? Okay? Do we really want to spend the entire weekend like this?
All right fine! If it means that much to you! But just-there's gonna be a ton left over.
Um, I straightened out your shower curtain so you won't get mildew. What? To me that's nice.
Hey, Rach. How was it with your friends? Okay! How would you like some Tiki Death Punch?
Okay. I gotta call Michelle. I gotta see if that was her voice or not. I'm sorry, I just have to.
Joey! This is not like learning to ride a horse! This is like learning to...grow a turtleneck!
All right!! All right. I got stung. Stung bad. I couldn't stand. I-I couldn't walk.
Oh thanks. Champagne, strawberries...Oh my God! I can't believe Chandler ordered porn on our wedding night!
Alright. If you guys don't want it to be special, fine. You can throw any kind of party you want.
Hey, it is unreasonable to expect a child to wait for a light bulb to cook brownies!
A Magic Eight ball?! You can't be serious, you can't make this decision with a toy!
Ok listen, you go down to the pool and reserve the chairs, and I'll get the magazines and the lotion.
Come on! Tests make us all better learners! Oh yeah! We should have essay questions!!
Didn't you listen to the story? I mean, this is twisted! How could you get involved with a woman like this?
All right then, when I'm done with this place, it's gonna be ten times better than that place!
Here, I got it. I'll will play my message for you guys, and you can tell me if it's breezy enough.
Hello? It's Joey. I'm so glad you called! Chandler told me what happened. Y'know he's really upset about it.
I'm so sorry, I can't believe I did this, but I couldn't stop laughing at your Norman Mailer story.
Fine, you can have the bath, but I am taking your boat. Now you're just a girl in a tub!
Look at us all dressed up for the big office party! By the way, what are we celebrating?
Well, she corned me! She asked if the wedding was in town! I mean, what was I supposed to do?!
Oh, I wish there was a job where I could wear this all the time. Maybe someday, there will be.
So if everyone liked it, and you liked it, that would make this a success. Which would make you...
Oh yeah, I got soap and sponges and rags and Carnuba wax and polishing compound.
Look, all we're trying to say is, don't let what happened with Carol ruin what you got with Emily.
Limited seating! Oh, that is such a lame excuse! That's not the reason she's not inviting me!
Whoa! Whoa!! Tackled by a girl! Bet ya don't see that everyday, do ya?
Wait a minute! So you told people I was pregnant?! Does this look like a conversation that I want to remember?!
I swear I didn't. Hey! Is that why you guys used to go up to your bedroom and lock the door?
Well, I was thinking, that you gave the guys such great haircuts, I thought, maybe you'd like to do mine?
Really. Well, at least 'big girls' don't pee in their pants in seventh grade!
You know what? It seems like you've been making an awful lot of stuff Irish lately.
I am going... I'm going--Turn it over! I'm... I am going to get these drops in your eyes.
No, it's okay, not only did I get to go out with Chip Matthews, I got to dump Chip Matthews.
Yeah... Yeah, I know it's pretty selfish, but haha, hey, that's me. Why don't you try the hummus?
And he came at us with an axe, so Rachel had to use a bug bomb on him!
Because it would totally freak him out and tomorrow's our anniversary. I just don't want anything to spoil that.
Alright, but I'm very excited about this OK, so you gotta promise you won't get all big-brothery and judgmental.
I have no moves. Okay, whatcha doin' there?! Oh y'know what? I'm sorry, this is just too weird.
Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- -I'd want yours.
Y'know, I only know of two surefire ways to shut a man up. And one of them is sex.
That's better. 90 seconds is a long time not to think about it...except all I did was think about it.
: Here why don't you sit down, get yourself comfortable because I. have a little surprise for you.
Okay! I'll be right out. I'm slipping into something a little less comfortable, and a little more slutty.
Well, given that we forgot to invite her it would be an awfully big coincidence if she was.
Phoebe is going to say "Yes" to David. See, that's what happens when you meddle in people's lives!
No! No it's not! It's not gonna be okay! It sucks! No swing band! No lilies!
Did you not hear where my head was? Come on! Come on we're a team! We're in this together!
Alright, you know, we got it, we got it. Let's play for real. High stakes... big bucks...
I think the things that you said about me are really unfair, and I would like for you to give my bouillabaisse another chance.
Hey, hey, look. Look Ross, Ben drew a picture of you! Huh? You're-you're a cowboy!
You know it's funny, the last time Paulo was here, my hair was so much shorter and cuter.
I couldn't eat it! I had five friends who couldn't eat it, and one of them eats books.
That's right. That's right. And that is why you can't stay here tonight. And probably why you shouldn't come to the wedding.
You don't think that umm, "The chef's Mahi Mahi was awful awful," is bad press?
It will be my pleasure. My guy has diplomatic coupons. Your guy can't even say coupons.
Oh, then bring it on! Oh, unless of course your afraid you might lose to a bunch of girls.
I'm just saying it's been a really long time for you. I mean, women have needs. Do it, get yours!
You guys haven't gotten your presents yet? Tomorrow's Christmas Eve, what're ya gonna do?
uh huh.. I mean these things happen. Its' just a plate. Its not like somebody died.
And then Chandler was, was really sweet and he consoled me. And well we drank too much...
Phoebe, it's not what you wear. It's sort of your songs... I just don't think you should play at the restaurant anymore.
All right, I'll go down there. But, I'm not gonna serve the lasagna. I'm gonna serve something I make.
Drunk enough that I know I wanna do this. Not so drunk that you should feel guilty about taking advantage.
Ohh, this is soo amazing! I can't believe my brother's getting married! And in London! It's so romantic!
Pheebs, you've been up for 24 hours! Go to sleep, honey. Th-this isn't healthy.
All right, there's some pizza at my place, we can all eat with one hand right? Are you with me?
Please? Please?! We just don't want to deal with telling everyone, okay? Just promise you won't tell.
What we did was wrong. Oh god, I just had sex with somebody that wasn't alive during the Bicentennial.
Mmm, looking good. Ok, cider's mulling, turkey's turking, yams are yamming. What?
No, to get a table! Places like are always shakin' you down. Everybody wants to be paid off.
Okay, come on, I can't get married until I get something old, something new, something borrowed, and something blue.
No. It was painful. Oh my God , they should call it Pain-zine, now with a little wax.
: Hey Rach its me ok I just got the Chandler's room and I caught him molesting himself.
What are you talking about? She obviously lives on the second floor, seventh apartment from the left!
That's right! Maybe it's time you took a good hard look at a mirror young lady...old lady...lady!
Oh really, you want to talk about quality? Have you heard of a key? It's what some people sing in.
Y'know when girls sleep with guys with weird things on their body, they tell their friends about it.
"Take me to the mansion in the sky-y". I am sorry, the song is over. Did you see me out there?
Oops! Y'know, your birthday is in a month-and-a-half, what do you say I forget to get you a present for that too?
How many perfectly fine women are you gonna reject over the most superficial insignificant things?
Umm, so how long have you been working with your dad? Come on, one of us had to mention him.
Wait-wait!! Okay, stop it! Stop it! Stop! Now listen, no one's gonna fight in this apartment.
Can you believe it? ...Y'know what? I just don't feel the thing. I mean, they feel the thing, I don't feel the thing.
You have nothing! You're not even going out! You're her baby sitter! You have a 12-year-old girl's job!
Oh, you mean like that guy thing where you act mean and distant until you get us to break up with you.
All right, so I haven't cleared the budget with my parents yet, but tell me how this is for music.
Okay. Umm, y'know, I don't think, I don't think I told you this, but umm, I just got out of a really serious relationship.
Is this the video of the baby being born? Sweetie, this is Phoebe's. Why were you even watching it?
Nothin', nothin', hey you're a cheapasaurus. I'm kidding, I'm kidding, thank you, I'm very greatful.
Chandler, I'm unemployed and in dire need of a project. Ya wanna work out? I can remake you.
Yeah.. uh, but for future reference, that thing in your hand can also be used as a phone.
That's right. I'm no longer a bride. I'll never be a bride again. Now, I'm just someone's wife!
Oh really? Okay? Well what would you say if I told you that, y'know, Ross or Chandler could beat you up?
Oh, I don't know. Maybe, um, "That was nice?" Admit something to me? "I'll call you?"
Okay. But wait, we can't. My Cousin Cassie is in the guest room, we're supposed to have lunch.
Oh my God! You own an Italian restaurant and you think that tastes good?! Where are you even from?
Rachel, if you want the little round waffles, you gotta have to wait until I find the little waffle iron.
Look , I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have.
Okay, now Thanksgiving's over, let's get ready for Christmas. Who wants to go get a Christmas tree?!
Well, I actually had the weirdest conversation with Joey. He was talking about rules and right and wrong and...
Ross! That is so sweet of you to get Phoebe that bike! When I heard the story, I almost cried.
But getting over was the hardest thing that I've ever had to do. And I never let myself think about you.
Really well. Yeah. Surprisingly well. Yeah, she didn't cry. She wasn't angry or sad.
You gotta go home and get the earrings that you borrowed from me okay? Chandler wants me to wear them tonight.
All right everybody! Everybody guess what? I just convinced Paul to give us a test next week!
Phoebe! Rachel! It's Monica! I wonder what you could possibly need me for on such short notice! Oh.
Ohhh! What are you doing to me?! Oh look, I-I... I'm sorry but umm, this-this-this-this is not going to happen.
Okay, how about the fact that he's engaged to another woman, who just happens to be your ex-best friend?
I know! I know! I am a terrible person! I mean, Chandler is never going to trust me with anything ever again!
Oh! Why didn't you tell me? I made him his own individual sweet potato stuffed pumpkin.
You better believe he's tired, after the day we had! If you know what I mean. You know what I mean?
It's beautiful! It's like the first bathroom floor there ever was. Whoa! Are you going in there for?
-but that wouldn't be fair to me, it wouldn't be fair to Alan- It wouldn't be fair to you!
Well, umm, Walker was looking for this big bus load of kids.... All right, I get your point.
Really? Wow, well then come on, I wanna show you how to fold the toilet paper into a point.
Well, uh y'know, our guy works with Chandler and he's really nice and smart and he's a great dresser!
Drunk enough to know that I want to do this. Not so drunk that you should feel guilty about taking advantage.
No no. See, in my bedroom I set my clock six minutes fast. You wanna know why?
Hey, you better hope that we're pregnant, because one way or another, we're giving a baby back to Rachel.
Well you-you did start that rumor about Ross making out with Mrs. Altman, our 50-year-old librarian.
So don't think of it as a bachelor party, think of it as a...a two month anniversary present.
No-no-no, that's a video-phone. But hey guys you're not supposed to be here, so please, do not touch anything.
She picked Rachel. I mean, she tried to back out of it, but it was obvious. She picked Rachel.
No. No you can't go. No this is fun. Come on we're just getting started. Here, here's your marker.
Oh my God. Okay, go into the bathroom, use whatever you want, just don't ever tell me what you did in there.
Phoebe, relax none of that stuff ever happens! They just put it on there for legal reasons!
And then we're gonna have a little Middle Eastern cous-cous. Something we can eat, with our hands.
Behind my brother's back? ... is exactly the kind of crazy thing you won't be hearing from me.
Yeah but I was just screwing with you to try to get your voice all high and weird like mine is now!
Hello, this is Monica... Yeah??? Oh... Okay, yes, we'll be right, we'll be right down. Thank you.
Really! All right? Let's forget about this going home stuff and celebrate our anniversary. Okay, this is empty.
He was in Ross's class...marching band...kinda overweight? Well, really overweight. I mean I was his thin friend.
I'm gonna hang this basket on the door and when the neighbors walk by they can all take a piece.
No honey. You have to sleep on this side of the bed because I have to sleep on this side of the bed.
Doctor, can I see you for just a minute please? My brother has a slight phobia about needles.
Y'know, I-I-I don't think that I can. So if you don't mind, maybe this will be it for me on the work things.
Wow, all you need now is The Killing Fields and some guacamole and you've got yourself a part-ay.
Wow! You might just get the first Nobel prize in rubbing. So what country is this guy from?
Really, Rachel, I was thinking of you the whole time. Look, I'm sorry, all right. I never meant for you to find out!
But either way... You're gonna get married, you're gonna be happy, my mom's gonna like you better than me.
Come on! Surprise her! Show up at her doorstep! Don't let her go without a fight!
Oh yeah, the Evander Holyfield phase. Oh man you were so hard up you practically came on to me.
No, no! We should divide them up and I should get extra because we used my card to buy them!
Oh sure, now you're Mister Sensitivity. But when you wanted to have sex right after my uncle's funeral.
Hand me those tomatoes, I'm gonna show you what it should taste like! Come on, hand me them.
Would you look at them. Am I ever gonna find a boyfriend again? I gonna die an old maid.
Wait a minute...Joey. Joey you can't ask her out, she's your roommate. It-it'll be way too complicated.
The muscles from Brussels, wham bam Van Damme, did you see Time Cop?
What if I have babies, okay? I mean I'm gonna look different. I'm okay with that, but I'm not sure that you are!
You know, on the way over here, I saw this drunk guy throw up. And then a pigeon ate it!
Okay, so, uh, we're in France, we're making the toast. Do you see a little bassinet in the corner?
Come on Chandler, come on! It'll give us great practice for when--people with babies come to visit.
Now Joey, you go down there and you suck up to him. I mean you suck like you've never sucked before!
What am I gonna do?! That is the dress! That is the dress! Wh...Chandler wants the band. What do I do?
Oh! Ohhhhh! Oh! Phoebe, come here. Aw, this is my new bed. You gotta feel this bad boy.
Joey, put that down! Oh my God! It's Pete. Okay, get out!! How the hell do you answer a video-phone!
Okay, just back off mister! Whoa. 'Cause I am ready to have a baby. I just want Joey to be the father.
Okay, is this like 'I have an early class tomorrow' or 'I'm secretly married to a goat?'
Yeah, you're my husband. I'm not gonna live in a different state than you for 208 days out of the year.
No. It disappears back there behind that baseboard. For a minute there, I thought it went downstairs.
Oh, Phoebe, she couldn't stop crying! With those thick glasses, her tears looked giant.
That's Paul's watch. You just put it back where you found it. Oh boy. Alright. Goodnight, everybody.
That's mine!! Now, would you both please start acting like adults? And get me my cough drops!
Look at me! My big concern is what's real?! Oh my God. We're really sad, aren't we?
Okay, well, we have to get past this! Why don't we get rid of the tape and pretend it never existed?
I know. But umm, one time there was this really dirty car in front of the building, so I washed it.
Oh now that-that-that's funny, it seems like Chandler's conference could've been in Connecticut or Vermont.
Alright, I'll tell you what. I'll come get you in 5 minutes with some sort of um, kabob emergency.
Well, maybe you should send him something. So that when he gets to Las Vegas he'll know that you're sorry.
It is in the living room where there is also a light! And no one will kick you in the shin.
You know that's nice, y'know we could put it back there after the surgeons remove it from your colon!
Nice work everybody! So much for the y'know, "You can drive it, but don't tell Rachel" plan!
Ya know, Roy saw Star Wars 317 times. His name was in the paper.
All right, look, I hate this as much as you, but if it makes you feel better, it's all your fault.
Yeah! All right, maybe you don't have to smile. Let's try something else. Let's try umm, try looking sexy.
I gotta make up the guest bedroom. Hey, Cousin Cassie is coming to stay with us a few days.
Look what I got! Look what I got! Look what I got! Can you believe they make these for little people?
Well I think the length of teasing is directly related to how insane you were so, a long time.
I'll get it. Hello. Hi Emily! Yeah, uh you-you tracked him down. Hold on one second.
No Joey! Chandler could be your assistant! See, he could answer all of your fan mail and stuff!
Ok, the first person's most embarassing memory is, 'Monica, your party sucks.' Very funny.
I am not 'so'! OK, I was a teensy bit weird at first, but... I'll be good. I promise.
So Nancy told me about this job at this great restaurant, Javo . It's just a little outside of Tulsa.
But I figured, you know, that shouldn't change anything. I mean, what the hell does it matter how old we are.
So whenever you're ready to apologize to me, I will forgive you. Good day! I can't feel my legs!
You're the most incredible woman I've ever met. How can I lose you? Now, I don't actually have a ring...
Come here. I'll make you feel like one of the guys. You know for a really cool guy, you suck at foosball.
Hey, I just whipped us up some Easy Bake treats, they should be ready in about three days.
Wow, isn't it ironic that David would show up on the same day that you and Mike exchange keys?
Well, it's the thought. Hey, doesn't Ross's flight get in in a couple hours? At gate 27-B?
Oh..please!I-I welcome criticism. 3rd Customer: The musician right outside the restaurant...it's kind of a mood-killer!
No! Wait! I think I can figure out the recipe from this cookie! I do stuff like this at work all the time.
Hey! Do you think that we can get to the subway right there if we climb down through the manhole cover?
No! That's where we keep the canned goods! Have you completely forgotten everything you learned at orientation?
All right, fine. Tonight's potatoes will be both mashed with lumps, and in the form of tots.
Alright, for the bizillionth time, yes I see other women in shower at the gym, and no I don't look.
All right. Now do it soon, he just asked me how to convert his dollars into Vermont money.
Wow. Y'know it is so weird. I mean, you're gonna tell this guy today and he has no idea what's gonna happen.
My god, if I had a nickel for every guy I wish I hadn't..., but this is about your horrible mistake.
What?! You can't shed a tear for your dead wife!! Now, I left you a note from the beyond!
What is the matter with you?! Do you want to fall into the trap? Do you want to fall into the trap?!
Well sure! I'm just wearing sweats! But that's good that you're not in love with me, because you just want a girlfriend!
No, it doesn't, does it? But you wanted lumps, Ross? Well, here you go, buddy, ya got one.
Aww thanks! God Will I'm so glad that you came! You look great! You must've lost like...
Um, well, I was going to, I-I-I really was. But um, then somewhere, just out of nowhere, I didn't.
God! Look at all these tickets! It's so exciting! You know I haven't won anything since the sixth grade.
No, it just remind me of something this guy did today at work. I told you about that funny guy, Geoffrey, right?
Damnit! Y'know this whole time we were concentrating on watching the babies and, and no one was watching Chandler!
Oh, just some pictures I made and hung up. I thought they'd brighten up the place. They do don't you think?
Okay that's it. I give up. At mom and dad's 40th anniversary, you're the one giving the speech.
This is so bizarre. I guess it kinda makes sense though, y'know she had such a terrible childhood.
All right, it'll be great! You just make her think you wanna have sex with her! It'll totally freak her out!
We were on the platform, ready to dance the world into the new Millennium, and the guy yelled 'CUT!'
Oh my God, sit down! Sit down! How long as it been since we've seen each other?
Believe me, Chandler and I have not seen each other in over a week. We'll probably be the first ones there.
MEG was good for me but I dumped her. Ya know, my motto is get out before they go down.
So the wedding caterer sent me this list of twelve appetizers and I have to narrow it down to six.
Please, when he left town you stayed in your pajamas for a month and I saw you eat a cheeseburger.
Oh, you must be freezing. You know what you need? How about a nice steaming cup of hot Mockolate?
Because! She's my cousin. I mean, we grew up together! We're family y'know? Well that's important to me.
Well, spring vacation is doing nice things with your grandparents. Spring break you're doing frat guys.
Sorry! I'm just-I'm not very good at this! I'm a terrible liar and I hate having to lie to Rachel!
I'm sorry, okay. It's just that Chandler has somebody, and Phoebe has somebody- I thought I'd ask Fun Bobby.
Ugh, I can not believe this! I mean, who is she to judge us? We could not have been nicer to her!
We're going to Las Vegas to see your dad. It's time you two talked, and I want to get to know my father-in-law.
Ok, my husband just gave your boyfriend some very bad advice. Look, David is going to propose to you tonight.
Look at that! Look at that! They're going into the first class lounge! Do you know what they have in there?
No. If you thought this mess is going to bother me, you are wrong! All right, let's go Blinky! Chandler!!!!
Okay, just stay there a couple more hours and if she doesn't show up by then, then just come on home.
Ok, I'm sensing that this is some kind of word play, because you are pink with barely controlled glee.
You're going to talk to him! Y'know what? We made a deal, I make your decisions and I say you're going to talk to him.
It is nothing like the Hobbit. It's like reading about every relationship I've ever had, except for Richard.
Well what is it? What is it? If it's gonna help bring the baby here, like today. I mean, I think you should do it.
Well, every, every Thanksgiving um, we used to have a touch football game called the 'Geller Bowl.'
Y'know, it is so strange seeing Ross here this time of day, 'cause usually he's got the children's hospital.
Oh, I so can't believe this! My uterus is an inhospitable environment? I was trying so hard to be a good hostess!
Well, that's different. My lie didn't make one of us a felon in 48 states. What were you thinking?
Ross, but me down for another box of the mint treasures, okay. Where, where are the mint treasures?
Me too! Yeah, Chandler can't stand it. He won't even allow me to have blue cheese in the house.
I mean, you're the one they're gonna come to when they wanna run away from home, and the one they talk to about sex.
Having a perfectly decorated tree is not what Christmas is about. It's about being with the people that you love.
Okay, everybody relax. This is not even a date. It's just two people going out to dinner and- not having sex.
Y'know what, don't tell us. We'll just wait until Chandler gets home, because it'll be more fun that way.
Oh, well don't take it to the same place you took the stereo, 'cause they've had that thing for over a week.
Chandler, this is crazy! What did you even say to him! "Come up, meet my wife! Give us your sperm"!
Yeah and you better watch the flirting too, cause you know, in such close quarters, it could be trouble.
Okay, Rachel, do you have any idea how painful it is to tell someone that you love them and not have them say it back?
I'm sorry it's just, Phoebe just always thought you were, you were charming in a, in a sexless kind of way.
Did anybody else feel they just wanted to peel the skin off their body, to have something else to do?
Oh! Let's see, well...if this is the wedding hall then umm you're parents will be at home in Queens.
I am so glad you guys got together, Chandler and I are always looking for a couple to go out with and now we have one!
: do you know how many times I've seen him jump up like that, believe me I know what he was doing.
So, if you're parents hadn't got divorced, you'd be able to answer a question like a normal person?
Well, my financially challenged friends, I split my money and I bought some shares of CHP and ZXY.
Ok, you see, the tag shouldn't be at the top left corner, it should be at the bottom right corner.
Have you lost your mind? Chandler, this isn't about me! This is about you and all your weird relationship commitment crap!
Hi, sorry. I almost didn't hear you, because y'know I'm just so in love with my new husband. We're on our honeymoon.
Maybe we could call the phone company. Maybe they could change the message. Maybe they can change his number.
It's okay. I suppose it could happen to anyone, not anyone I know, but... By the way I can still see it.
Rachel would be Phoebe's, I would be Rachel's, that way we all get to do it once and no one would get upset.
Hey that reminds me, I thought we could use some extra luck so I brought a wishbone home from work.
Am I on fire today or what?! Those birds are browned, basted, and ready to be carved!
Oh, he is. And he is so dreamy. I mean, y'know what, when he left I actually used the phrase, 'Hummina-hummina-hummina.'
Wow! You're a lot sturdier that Chandler. He crumpled like a piece of paper. So how was you're trip?
Oh my god, Emma. Oh, sweetie, I forgot you were here. Oh, you're right, we can't do this. We can't leave her alone.
No, honey, its. thats a special plate. See its a game, whoever gets that plate wins.
"Hi I'm Rachel, is my sweater too tight? No? Oh, I'd better wash it and shrink it!"
Do you realize that four weeks from today we're getting married? Four weeks baby!! Four weeks!!!
Yeah. But of course we had to update it a little bit. Hey, by the way, great thinking about catching me!
Tonight you're supposed to waitress for me, my catering thing, any of those words trigger anything for you?
Maybe. Joey: Wait. Your 'not a real date' tonight is with Paul the Wine Guy?
Look at it! Ohhh! Wallpaper's a little faded, that's okay. Carpet's a little loose. Hardwood floors!!
Okay listen, y'know when you move in Rachel's room is gonna be empty, you wanna talk about what we want to do with it?
Hi honey. We just got a wedding gift from Bob and Faye Bing; they don't like us do they?
Yeah. Go over to Joey's. Go over to Joey's and drink some beer and hammer up some drywall.
I can't believe you married Duncan. I mean how could you not tell me? We lived together, we told each other everything.
How do I tell Chandler that it's too soon. It's gonna break his heart, he's not gonna think that I don't love him anymore.
Ah no, you see, someone was supposed to take them down around New Years... but obviously someone forgot.
Okay, we'll start with the building. You guys take the first and second floor, Phoebe and I'll take third and fourth.
Oh, I know! Umm, is it because he's always correcting people's grammar? Whom! Whom! Sometimes it's who!
So I'm not supposed to share my doubts and fears with the guy I'm gonna spend the rest of my life with?
Oh no, you see we're on our honeymoon. So umm, can you do your little thing and bump us up to first class?
See? This is exactly why I'm making this candy. We can learn their names and get to know our neighbors.
Hello? No rejection? I got shot down at fat camp! Boy, kids are mean when they're hungry.
No, I think we should save our china for something really special. Like if the Queen of England comes over.
Anyway, it just doesn't seem worth it to make a whole turkey for just three people. Okay? It's a lot of work.
Okay you were right! All right, I never should have bought them! They're killing me! One toe at a time!
All right, I'm gonna show you something a lot of guys don't know. Rach, give me that pad, please? All right. Now...
Ok first of all...It would be great. But that's not what I'm here to talk to you about. I need to borrow some money.
Okay, looks like Ross and I are captains. Okay, so um, I bunnied first so that means I get to pick first. Joey.
Does she use the cups? Yes! I believe she does. Does she use the plates? Yes! I believe she does.
Do you realize this is probably the last time we'll all be here in the coffee house as six single people?
Would you stop? We've only been going out a couple of weeks, I mean we don't even know if he's gonna propose.
Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet!
Chandler, if that dog's been here that long, and you haven't had a reaction, maybe you're not allergic to this dog?
You are so cute! No. No, it was a fight. You deal with it and move on! It's nothing to freak out about.
My mother's driving me crazy, but Ross is getting married. I'm happy. I'm not going to let anything spoil that.
Oh no-no-no, it's only one night a week, and plus I get to take all of you out for a lot of free dinners.
No that is not what happened with us. Well, I was umm, I was really sad that night because this guy that I was Ross's mom.
And it could be soon. I mean, think about it: right now, somewhere out there our baby could be being conceived.
'Cause I just keeping thinking about all these things that I'm not gonna have and it's freaking me out. I don't know what to do about it.
I don't know. I mean, you saw him do a love scene, so maybe you don't have a thing for Joey, maybe you have a thing for Drake.
Isn't that sad? I mean, can you see how pathetic that is? You shouldn't be jealous. You should feel bad for him.
How great are you, you little saver?! I mean, the-the amount you have is exactly the budget of my dream wedding!
Let's take a walk. Y'know maybe you should consider writing for Talking Out of Your Ass magazine!
Hi, umm I know this is last minute, but we've decided to throw an impromptu baby shower for Rachel today.
Phoebe, your face is fine! Come on, none of this stuff is going to happen to you! Stop being such a baby!
Yeah, ours pretty much sucked, oh, but, I did run into little Stevie Fisher. Remember him?
'Cause they took our apartment, I wanted to punish them. But I'm-I'm done now. They've suffered enough.
Oh my God. That was so amazing! When did you Hold on! I almost forgot loser! When did you stop sucking?
Come on Phoebe, let's go! Come on, it's time to get serious, huddle up. Joey, keep your head in the game.
I-I-I'm sorry, your-your mouth was full, I didn't hear what you said. Umm, hats off to who now?
Okay, y'know what? Don't worry, okay? We'll take care of it. We'll call her. Just go home and get ready.
Well, at least you have one thing to be happy about. That jerk Gavin from your office didn't show up .
All right, let me see. Will Chandler have sex tonight? Don't count on it. Seems like it works to me.
Hi, Ben. Hi. I'm your Aunt Monica. Yes I am. I'm your Aunt Monica. I...I will always have gum.
You see that guy? He's in classics now, but y'know as soon as we leave he's going straight to the porn.
Yeah, well kinda cute, like really kinda cute, or kinda cute like your friend Spackel Back Larry?
No, he's not. And if I can't get pregnant with you, then I don't want to get pregnant by... him or anyone else.
Sex! This is the last day I'm ovulating, and when we don't do it now, we'll have to wait till next month.
Hey. Okay, so umm, since that video camera thing didn't work out uh, I thought that I would give you just a little preview.
You see, if we'd gone around them like I said, we-She would've given us those tickets. Damnit!
He just told me at the counter. He made me promise not to tell, but I couldn't hold it in any longer!
Hey, it's Phoebe and Rachel. Um, why don't you tell them what you were telling me earlier about me not being high maintenance?
: what means if he gets like a disease or kills someone. not if he gets his jollys to jaws!
You wanna finish this right now? All right, we get a deck of cards, high card wins. What do you say?
I missed this apartment! Now, this is a grown-up's apartment! Y'know, I-I should be with a grown-up, do you know what I mean?!
Yeah, we switched meat suppliers at work, and the new guys gave me the steaks as sort of a thank-you.
So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks?
I can't do that either! The soles' are already a little scuffed up and the insides are filled with my blood.
I'm sorry. But not that sorry, 'cause you don't have to live with it. Um, we have a reservation under the name Chandler Bing.
Oh, she was a cruel, cranky, old bitch! And I'm sorry she died. Did Dad say I get the dollhouse?
Honey, that's okay. I actually know this woman, Nancy, who's a restaurant biz head-hunter. Maybe she'll know of something.
Huh. So you're saying like umm, if there was an award for the best bad massage, well who would get that?
Come on, get into bed! I want to prove to you that I'm not sick! I wanna make you feel, as good as I feel.
Dad, dad this is a good thing for me. Ya know, and you even said yourself, you've never seen Richard happier.
Oh it's so cute. I wonder what age it is when you stop being able to put both legs over your head.
Is that why he's acting so weird...? He's jealous...? Oh my God, that is crazy. It's not like I'm attracted to Geoffrey...
What?! I mean, I didn't work this hard and-and-and lose all this weight so that I can give my flower to someone like him!
Deep Impact was the one with Robert Duval, Armageddon is what's going to happen to you if you wake me up.
All right, hold on okay? First thing's first. Okay, now did Ross sit anywhere while he was naked?
Uh, no. Loosely translated 'We should do this again' means 'You will never see me naked'.
The strange part was, he was really nice, umm and he looks great, but I didn't feel anything at all!
Because I need the money, and I thought that it'd be a great way to get rid of that last little schmidgen of self-respect.
Okay, you stay here, and just wait by the phone. Spray Lysol in my shoe, and wait for Ross to kill you.
Abso... ...lutely. See, I love creating new recipes. I love Thanksgiving. And, well, now, I love Mockolate.
Listen, um honey, I appreciate this but you don't have to keep hanging out with them for me, I mean, they have each other.
It's gonna be ok. Ryan's been under water. He's just gonna be so glad that you don't have barnicles on your butt.
I think this is so cool because none of our friends are here and we can be a real couple. We don't have to hide.
I don't know, my hand feels weird. I guess it's because, I'm engaged! How long before it starts getting annoying?
Well that's a little crazy. Although I am y'know glad to hear that you're branching out on what you look at on the Internet.
Umm, I think I spoke too quickly. There-there's a learning curve with this job and maybe we can try it again.
Is there any chance that you can look at this as flattering? I mean, she's doing it because she wants to be more like you.
You call eight hours alone with my label maker wasted time? Ooh, now I get to use my shredder!
This is so wild. Ya know, I gotta admit, I was kinda surprised that you agreed to go on a blind date.
Oh, I know, I never wear fake ones. I just did it so my Mom wouldn't give me grief about me biting them.
Well. Sounds like you're writing yourself a little play there Rach. Wow! Let me know how that one turns out.
Oh my God! Oh, this is incredible! Ohh! All right, y'know what? I'm just gonna roll right into that office and-and quit!
All right, I'm gonna go steam my wedding dress okay? Who wants the responsibility of making sure nothing happens to it?
I need a few more things to make the margaritas. Uhh, I need some salt, some margarita mix, and tequila.
Yeah and-and I'm sorry too. But, well I just-I like things done a certain way and the chemistry's just not right.
No, no, not a party. Just a surprise gathering of some people Rachel knows. Um, this is Phoebe and Chandler and Joey.
Oh wait, wait, unless you happened to catch the Reruns' production of Pinocchio, at the little theater in the park.
Y'know in a weird way, you have too much power. Look, you're gonna have to help me out here, 'cause I only have three.
Oh man, they think they are so slick messing with us! But see they don't know that we know that they know! So...
Good? Didn't you hear them...I was great! Thank you so much for making me do this. That's is the best gift ever.
It's so weird, how did Joey end up kissing Charlie last night? I thought you'd end up kissing Charlie.
Wow! Look At This! I Can'T Believe I Even Fit Into This Shirt! Oh, this is yours.
Look Rach, we have to move. I mean if they had lost, we would've made them get rid of the birds. Right?
Y'know what? Y'know when I said that I want you to deal with this relationship stuff all on your own? Well, you're not ready for that.
It is so great to meet a guy who is smart and funny, and has an emotional age beyond, like eight.
I don't know, I've never had to use the other one. I'm just saying y'know, if we're having sex, he's not gonna be talking.
You're right, you're right I shouldn't freak out. 'Cause this is what will happen when you and I have babies! When will that be?!
You are! Hey, here's twenty bucks. -- Why don't you go buy yourself something pretty while I'm at work tomorrow?
I'm making a list of all the things that are most likely to go wrong at the wedding. Now, that way I can be prepared.
Thanks. I'll call you tomorrow. Okay. Okay, let's let the Alan-bashing begin. Who's gonna take the first shot, hmm?
Look, maybe this is none of my business, or maybe it is, I don't know... but, uh, I'm kind of worried about you.
Are you crazy?! We own those two! I mean look at 'um, he can't breath and she's popping pills.
It's easy! Just keep it casual! Give him a kind word, shake his hand and give him the money!
Oh no-no-no, not Dr. Burke. Dr. Burke is out of town. The-the on-call doctor will see me now.
Okay, just so you know, I'm gonna be ovulating from tomorrow until the sixth, so don't touch yourself in the next 48 hours.
Because I don't have the money or the equipment to handle something that big on such short notice. I mean there's no way.
It's not a date, okay. I'm just gonna teach him how to make lasagne for some pot luck dinner he has.
I've not seen her since high school graduation. Oh my God, that night she got so dru. . . motional.
Well, I don't know... I-It's... just the way you say it... I mean, you're funny... You have that funny thing. You're a funny guy!
Here, let me show you. Okay, the towels are hanging next to the sink, and umm, you can use the fancy soap.
No way, with one pound to go, c'mon. We're workin', we're movin', we're in the zone we're groovin'.
Well, you just-you put a quarter in and y'know pull-pull some handles and win like a candy bar or something.
Listen, I'm sure that dad doesn't care. He probably thought this was funny; he'll be telling this story for years!
Good! Now, take those salads to table 4, And you! Get the swordfish! And you! Get a haircut!
I know!! Chip? Hi! It's Monica. 'Kay. 'Kay. Okay. Okay, good-bye. Oh my God, we just had the best conversation!!
Well no wait a minute that's not true! No, what did, that was really sweet. And it kinda works out for the best.
That's right. That is right, you go over there and tell her you don't want her to live with you. Do not take no for an answer!
Soon! I-I just couldn't before. You saw how upset Joey got! I couldn't do that to her, she's my best friend!
No! No-no! I love it! It is a great present! In fact, why don't you go home and wait for the thank you card?
No no no, if I couldn't pay you back right away then I'd feel guilty and tense every time I saw you.
This is not, what I'm wearing. I'm ovulating and Chandler's gonna be home any minute, so I thought we would try before dinner.
I gotta go water Pete's plants. Y'know what, if he's gonna break up with me, maybe I won't water his plants.
Alright, wait a second, why would Ross tell everyone in your class that you are as... "gay as the day is long"?
I have like five times, but the guy is so charming, that I go up there to yell and then I end up apologizing to him.
I'm-I'm sorry, it's just that umm... Well I-I cook at this restaurant, Alessandro's, and umm I just got a really bad review...
Well, CHP because I used to have a crush on Eric Estrada. And ZXY becuase I think it sounds zexy.
Oh my God! It's true!! Oh my God you are so amazing! Oh my God, can I just ask you to do me oh, just one favor?
Honey, we were at this beautiful place, and I-I-I just put our names down for fun! I mean, what's the harm in that?
Ok, right about now the turkey should be crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside. Why are we standing here?
Okay. So you, me and London. Looking at people differently. Maybe he wants to do what you and I did in London with someone.
Well umm, we were just talking about the y'know, the Swing Kings and just wondering whether y'know, they were the right way to go.
Well, the end table is wrong, The couch looks bizarre and don't even get me started on the refrigerator magnets.
Well it wasn't that many guys. I mean, if you consider how many guys there actually are, it's a very small percentage.
Chandler! It happens to lots of guys! You-you-you were probably tired, you had a lot of champagne, don't worry about it!
Don't get too cocky! Remember I won the last one! Oh, by the way, how did that feel, losing to a girl?
Thats not how you see me, is it? Phoebe while cutting a sweet potatoe in the air: No you're all about the fun.
I can't! I spent so much money on them and I told Chandler that I'd wear them all the time, I just can't give them away!
He used to lock himself in the basement for hours. No one was every allowed to hear, "The Sound."
Oh, I haven't had that feeling since I first started going out with Chandler. Wow, I'm never gonna have that feeling again am I?
I had to go all the way to the basement because some idiot keeps stuffing the trash chute with pizza boxes!
All right Rachel, you sweep behind, I'll pitch it to you, you throw it down field to Phoebe. All right. Break.
Well I-I talked to and uh, she's definitely going to have this baby. Y'know, she said she was gonna raise it on her own.
Yes. Uh, yes, I did. That was my friend, Eddie Moskowitz. Yeah, he likes it. Reaffirms his faith.
I love you. Hey listen umm, when, when you were talkin' about our future you said cat, but you meant dog right.
Well, I'm never gonna listen to you again, that's for sure! "Y'know, harm can it do if you go and put your name down?"
Oh my god. We're trying to get pregnant so he's probably starting to freak out about the fact that my body is going to change.
Yeah and if I had seven, maybe I would've said something like this, "Wow! My boyfriend's such a wise ass-seven!"
Aw, my little nephew. Come here, little one. There's my little baby Ben. Hey, my little boy. Hey, he's not crying.
Honey, uh, this is a picture of the frame guy posing in front of a bright blue screen with a collie.
Come on Rach, when a guy says he's going to call, it doesn't mean he's going to call. Hasn't it ever happened to you?
All right, come on guys, let's go! Tie score, and we're runnin' out of time. Forty-two!! Thirty-eight!! Hike!
No! No-no! He is totally incompetent. I called the chef who recommended him to me. He said, "Ha-ha! Gotcha!"
Yes there is! He's black and white and shaggy and he's sitting next to Rachel and licking Rachel's hand.
That tape was never meant to be seen by... Joey I would feel more comfortable if I was having this conversation in private.
Look! You knew this about me when you married me! You agreed to take me in sickness and in health. Well, this is my sickness!
And the musicians, look, they can go over here , okay? And the chairs can face this way , and... You go.
Used to work with her. Used to! I'm a relative and I didn't get invited! A blood relative! Blood!!
This isn't mine. Hey, this isn't, this isn't my stuff! Ugh, Ross! These are your boxes! Where are my boxes?
Okay. All right, turkey. Eh, that won't work. Cheese? That won't work. Olive loaf? I hope that won't work.
Well for your information he happens to be one of the brightest, most sophisticated, sexiest men I've ever been with.
Yeah, she hates all mass produced stuff. She thinks her furniture should have a history, a story behind it.
Not that, this, US. Oh my God, Ross, you-re, you're, it's jus-, you-, ever sin- you been here.
Aww, sweetie, but it's not like you're not gonna have anything. You're gonna have nieces and nephews, and some ways that's even better.
All right Rach, for what it's worth, I think that you're doing great. I mean y'know let's face it, no one handles this well.
Look, these clowns are trying to take us for a ride and I'm not gonna let 'em! And we're not a couple of suckers!
Hi. Hi, uh, yes, this is Monica Geller. Um, I believe I'm taking some classes with you and I was wondering what they were.
: Joey I am not going to objectify woman with you but if her face is as nice as her ass woah mamma.
Okay. Mrs. Green! Okay I'm really sorry!! I'm apologizing for the- Okay, I bit my tongue, but I'm still really sorry!
Mom says it's all of Manhattan, parts of Brooklyn and Queens, and they have no idea when it's coming back on.
Why?! To celebrate your relationship! To solidify your commitment! To declare your love for one another to the world!
Huuh, alright, Danny Arshak, ninth grade. Oh, c'mon Rach, you know the bottle was totally pointing at me.
No sweetie, you've got to win over the guy that controls C.H.E.E.S.E.! You've got to kiss some serious robot ass!
What are you being such a weenie for? So he has a Barbi, big deal. You used to dress up like a woman.
I cannot believe that I just spent the last two days trying to figure out the recipe and it was in my cupboard the whole time!
Hey, Rach! I made a pile of your stuff over on this side of the room. If you could just......throw your purses at it.
Naaaa... He still kills me. Last night he had me laughing so hard, I swear... a little pee came out.
No, a doctor of meat. Of course he's a real doctor. And he's handsome, and he's sweet, and know you'd like him.
Noo!! The point is that is was you that was there that night! It is you that I am marrying! It is you that I feel in love with!
Ok, these were unbelievably expensive, and I know he's gonna grow out of them in like, 20 minutes, but I couldn't resist.
Umm, excuse me, we switched apartments. You can't eat are food anymore, that-that gravy train had ended.
Oh, I'll have an espresso. Oh acutally, I'll get it. If I ask you to, you'll probably end up drinking it yourself.
Joey, what's it like on a movie set, huh? Do you have a dressing room? Do you have a chair with your name on it?
Umm, I'd love too! Ooh, I love macaroni and cheese. I love-I love the way this box feels against my cheek.
So, maybe I am a little high maintenance. And maybe Rachel is a little bit of a pushover. But you know what we decided you are?
Chandler that's crazy! If you give up every time you'd have a fight with someone you'd never be with anyone longer than-Ohhh!
Dad, please don't pick your teeth out here! Alright, and if you're gonna put your feet up, why don't you sit on the-
I don't need an actual man, just a couple of his best swimmers. And there, there are places you can go to get that stuff.
No, Ross, we do not hate Emily. We-we just, we just think that you're having to sacrifice a whole lot to make her happy.
I don't know, how about the idiot who thought he could drive from Albany to Canada on a half a tank of gas!
Well... That's not the only time this was an issue. You remember when umm, you spent Thanksgiving with us? You called me fat.
All right, I've got a whole bunch of uh-uh, stuff in this area, but umm, I'm getting the feeling that you don't want to deliver.
How can you smoke in this day of age? Do you not seen that ad with a little kid walks to grandpa, it's chilling.
We left Joey alone with the food! Yep! Yep, I knew it! There he is... feeding stuffing to a dog!
Uh I really don't know what to tell you Rach, I really don't. I mean, maybe Joey can help you out with your, with your big work problem.
Honey, you can relax. Last night at work, Geoffrey told this really sexist joke. After that, not so funny anymore.
She has a better chance of sprouting wings and flying up your nose than you do of not making fun of us.
Oh, um, around 8:02. We ah, talked for a little while, and then um, we went out for an innocent burger.
It's just... It's hard enough not seeing you during the week, but for Christmas... alright, if this is what you have to do, I understand.
Listen, uh, you told me something that was really difficult for you. And I, I-I figured if you could be honest, then I can to.
Yeah, once again, I am sorry. Thank you. Bye. I just had to turn down a job catering a funeral for sixty people.
I know, he's too charming, but if you two start going out, then it's just gonna make it so much harder for me to hate him.
Okay, look, this is probably for the best, y'know? Independence. Taking control of your life. The whole, 'hat' thing.
Joey, you know, maybe your just not used to kissing men, maybe you just tensed up a little, maybe that's what you need to work on.
Because he's terrible! Okay, he's slow, he burns things, last night he lit my pastry chef on fire!
Okay, I think that's it. The seating chart is done. This is our wedding. They all look like they're having fun don't they?
Ahh, Pete, the other day when you said you needed to talk, umm, just so I know, is it good news or bad news.
It's not ok to do it in a doctor's office but it is ok to do it in a parked car behind a Taco Bell?
Forget the bubblewrap! There isn't time! Rachel starts messing up Amy's hair: Frizzy frizzy frizzy frizzy!!
Okay? Over here we have pink suede, which is nice. But umm, if it gets wet then you know it's gonna shrink.
Okay, Ben, I won't tell your daddy that you had ice cream for dinner, if you don't tell about our little bonking incident.
Oh I'm working on my toast for the party, or as I like to call it. Sob fest 2002. Hey check this out.
Y'know, no point in dragging it out. Dragging out the long process of you moving out and us not living together anymore.
I just don't think arcade games go in the beautiful guest room. The beautiful guest room is gonna be filled with antiques.
Sounds smart and healthy to me. So um, just out of curiosity, um, do you currently have any other racquetball buddies?
He cannot play at our wedding! I mean everyone will leave! I mean come on, that is just noise! It's not even a song!
Oh, I still can't believe my dad saw us having sex! He didn't make it to one of piano recitals, but this he sees!
I give good massages! I used to give them to Rachel all the time before she got allergic! And-and-and Chandler loves them! Watch!
Rachel if you, if you want to go out with him, you can. Sound like a big jerk to me but if that's what you want to do...
Honey! Do you know that none of that stuff came from me?! I mean I never said I wanted to have babies and get married right now!
This is where I thought the barca lounger could go! You see you could see the TV and it's still walking distance to the kitchen.
Y'know what? I am really tired of your bellyaching! Okay, I-I worked really hard at making this a nice place for us to live!
Look honey, I wanted you to hook up with Ross as much as you did. But he's with her now and you're just gonna have to get over it.
Nononononono. Think who you're dealing with here. I mean, I'm not like you. I-I can't even stand in front of a tap class.
Okay it's time for the toast! Umm now-now, I know that Ross usually gives the toast, but this year I'm going to do it.
Okay, if you need the vacuum, it's in my closet on the left-hand side. Ah, the garbage bags are next to the refrigerator...
Well, I just think the baby would keep falling off the dog. Do you, uh, do you , do you not see kids in our future.
Okay. Okay, I can't wait! This is going to be the best Valentine's Day ever! I can't believe it! Make the presents! Make the presents!
Ya know, I was thinking. Ya know how we always stay at your apartment? Well, I thought maybe tonight we'd stay at my place.
Why don't you just weigh out the good stuff about the relationship against the bad stuff. I mean that's what I did when I first weighing stuff.
I mean I-I thought you were nuts at first, but you-you did it. And now you can just look back at this thing with no regrets.
Guys can fake it? Unbelievable. The one thing that's ours! Besides, why would you fake it when we're trying to have a baby?
Mom already called this morning to remind me not to wear my hair up. Did you know my ears are not my best feature?
I don't know it! I want to have a kid with you because I think you're going to be an amazing dad... at the fun parts and the hard parts.
Well he is! Yeah, I mean marriage is all he talks about! My goodness, in fact, I'm the one that's making him wait!
Ohh, of course we are! We left it up to fate. If we were supposed to get married there would be a clear-cut sign.
Yeah, well I don't think it really counts if you have to read them off the back of your hand after you fall asleep on the couch.
Who da wenny-Benny boy? You the Wenny-wenny-Benny-Benny boy, yes. Don't cry. Don't cry. Why is he still crying?
Okay, all right, I think you're great, I think you're sweet, and you're smart, and I love you. But you will always be the guy who peed on me.
Oh yeah, I remember mine! Ohh, it was my sixth birthday, my dad took me to the park, I got it, and...it bent.
You may be okay about getting hurt, but I am not okay with being the one who hurts you. That's why I can't take this job.
He's great! I mean we have such a good time together! He's so funny, and sooo sweet, and I'm not attracted to him at all!!
I wanna buy 5 shares of SGJ and I wanna buy them now. C'mon time is money my friend. Thank you. Wooo.
Chandler, we have talked about this. You are not supposed to give people advice! Now couldn't you just have made some sort of inappropriate joke?
Y'know what? He will forgive you. And I like to bring a pad with me when I go answer the phone just in case... Okay...
Money is so impersonal. Cookies says someone really cares. . . Alright, we're broke, but cookies do say that.
I'm gonna miss this hand! Okay I know it's a lot to ask, but oh my God Chandler, this is a once in a lifetime opportunity.
Now everybody knows the basic erogenous zones. You got one, two three, four , five, six, and seven!
Yeah. But a part of me also can't wait 'til it's over. Chandler and I have this pact not to have sex again until the wedding.
I'm not really here. Just thought I'd drop these off...on the way.. my way... Do you come here a lot? Without me?
Chandler! Everyone--no one's eating my Tuscan finger food 'cause they're all filling up on Phoebe's snow cones!
I'm not going to be a part of this! You can't just bring some random guy at home and expect him to be our sperm donor!
No! All he's thinking about is how you're taking this! I mean, listen it's totally freaking him out. He's talking about moving to Vermont.
I'd rather hang out with a sniveling work weasel guy when I can be hanging out with my boyfriend who I actually respect.
Oh...Phoebe? Maybe I wasn't clear before. I really love listening to your music here, but my restaurant is sort of an upscale place.
Okay! It's time for dinner. Everyone we're using our fancy china.. um and its very expensive so please be careful.
Well, after 15 years of mom and dad keeping it as a shrine to you, it's time the velvet ropes came down.
Aww, the only reason you want to go out with me because my blond wig, and the big boobs, and the fact that I serve you food.
Sure! If you're just gonna hang out as friends, then maybe I'll join ya. You know, I'm your friend and Mike's friend .
I am really an idiot. you see, I was filling out my friend's form, and instead of putting her information, I put mine.
Oh my God, I can't believe what I'm getting ready to say. I wanna have a baby, but I don't wanna have one with someone who doesn't really wanna have one.
Yeah, and y'know, if you could not mention to them that we live together, that would be great! , I was thinking we would eat around four.
Ohh... Oh, that's okay I hate when people come back to complement the chef. Like I have nothing better to do! So what's up?
Oh it's not big, not at all, you know, kinda the same lines as, say, oh I don't know, having a third nipple.
He didn't die. I saw his daughter last week. Said he was fine. Her on the other hand, botched Botox.
Okay, I got it. Phoebe? All right, you pull. I'm gonna spread the legs as wide as I can. Joey? Now is not the time!
Oh, sure it does! In high school, you weren't jealous at all even though all your girlfriends were cheating on you!
Oh no! I don't know anything about cooking. I had to ask someone what it's called when the, when the water makes those little bubbles.
The days and nights are hard! I get it! Okay? Look umm, Rachel I'm sorry! I have to start getting ready! I'm getting married today!
What if it's new? I mean, we agreed not to talk again, unless we had something really important to say. Shouldn't I call him back?
An era is defined as a significant period of time. Now, it was significant to me, maybe it wasn't significant to you!
So why-why wasn't Ross's stuff ruined? And if you say the words medical marvel I'm going to Easy Bake your head!
No! To take more pictures of all of us together. I mean I really think it's the best resolution because everyone will enjoy the pictures.
Yes! Carol and Susan's caterer had a mountain bike accident this weekend, and she's in a full body cast.
Wait a minute, you stayed home all day and played Ms. Pac-Man while I went off to work like some kind of chump?!
Oh wow! Okay. Don't scare me like that okay? I mean for a minute there I was like, "Oh my God! The worst has happened!"
All right, big brother. Which of these do you think would make your little sister look hotter, so your best friend would want to do her?
Come on! Come on, if we have sex again it'll double our chances of getting pregnant. Do you think that closet's still available?
All right, so now that Ross knows can you tell us y'know how it happened? I mean, when did it happen? How many times did it happen?
When Mom and Dad drove you to the hospital to get your nose fixed, I swam into the lake and fished it out.
Okay, okay, I'm sure that Rachel came home early and picked up Emma. You go look across the hall, and I'll call her cell.
Alright, let me ask you this question: How many of you thought the music was fine, but not in keeping with the tone of the restaurant? .
I'll be coordinator! Oh my God! I'm so sorry, I didn't get you anything! Okay, look everybody has to help! Okay? You can help, can't you Phoebe?
Hey! Continuing the countdown of your favorite meals. Tonight, No. 3, macaroni and cheese with cut up hot dogs.
White House adviser? Clinton's campaign guy? The one with the great hair, sexy smile, really cute butt?
And when he's naked I can throw him out in the front yard and lock the door and all the neighbors will just humiliate him!
I'm fine now, but it was really scary there for a while. I mean, someone slipped a-a threatening note under the door.
You sat back and let him have her, you didn't fight at all. Am I right? Do you want the same thing to happen with Emily?
Gee, I don't know Rach. Order up!! I got a Yentel soup, a James Beans, and a Howdy hold the Dowdy!
All right, I'm out of oven space. I'm gonna turn on Joey's. Please, watch him! Do not let Joey eat any of the food!
Ok, all right. It was an accident, I swear, all right. I was putting on my jacket, and the thing, and the lamp, and it broke.
No, those first two windows, that's the lobby. And y'know the other one over there, that's the stairway. You've been counting wrong.
All right, all right. Maybe I can fit them in if I just do some rearranging. But uh, Rachel may actually have to sit at the bar!
But, you see, it's just... this night has to go just perfect, you know? And, well, Wendy's more of a... professional waitress.
Y'know, I think if I were going to be with a woman. It'd, it'd be with someone like Michelle, she was so oh, she was so petite.
It's weird, but you know what I don't wanna throw this away. I mean this is like all I have left of him, gross, drain hair. Ooh!
That's what we used to call your ah, your motorcycle in high school. Y'know how a motorcycle is a Chopper, and you're Chip. Nevermind.
Oh wait, you know what, I got it, I got it, pretend like you just woke up, okay, that will throw her off. Be sleepy.
I know! Now look, there's only one problem though. There's only room for one, so I guess one of you will have to stay at Joey's.
Oh, and I can also speak a little French. Voulez-vous coucher avec moi ce soir? Why? What did I say?
Hey Rach, what about this? Huh? Who-who gets this? See, I don't know if I want it because it might be y'know, too many memories!
Oh my god. Today's the sixth?! I may be done ovulating! I may have also served some very questionable meat at the restaurant.
You're just new at this, it'll get better, think about your first day at work. I mean, that couldn't have been easy but you figured that out.
Oh, and by the way, he's lost a bunch of weight. I mean he looks goo-ood! Okay, I mean really, really gorgeous! I still love Chandler.
Wait a minute, why don't you just call Mark. I mean, who says you have to sit here and wait for him, you've got to make stuff happen.
I figured out I need to charge seventeen bucks a jar just to break even. So, I've got a new plan now. Babies.
Rachel you have to read this book. It's called Be Your Own Windkeeper. It's about how women need to become more empowered.
Oh, my mom called, they're gonna run our engagement announcement in the local paper, so we're looking for a good picture of us.
Great! Umm, well what-what I was doing in Chandler's room is that umm, I was cleaning it! In fact, he pays me to clean it!
Thanks. Like, check out my new catering stuff. Look at this! I'm an omelet station! Omelet? Made to order!
Ha, ha, very funny, very funny. But I think we'd like to give poker another try. Shall we, ladies?
Alright here's something, it says to try holding the baby close to your body and then swing her rapidly from side to side.
That's a good question. Look umm, last night we let the dice decide. Maybe we should leave it up to fate again. I love you!
All right, Chandler can make boxes, Ross can wrap, and Joey can lift things. Now Phoebe, go tell the guys they have to help out!
I'm on top of the world, looking down on creation and the only explanation I can find, is the wonders I've found ever since...
Yeah, I'm sure your ex-wife will be more than happy to move to another country so you can patch things up with your new wife.
Great! Well Rachel, the reason why I won't let you drive the Porsche is because you're a terrible driver. There! That wasn't about the wedding.
And, well, don't you have a lot of wild oats to sew? Or is that what you're doing with me? Oh my God, am I an oat?
Y'know I used to go out with this guy that was a really light sleeper, and whenever I started to snore, he would just roll me over...
Okay, the reason why I asked you guys out to brunch today is because I have been doing some thinking about who should be my maid of honor.
Good morning, Tiger! I'm making you a nice big breakfast so you can keep up your strength for tonight. You're gonna get me good and pregnant.
Hey, see that snippy guy over there? He's the one who decides who gets up on the platform. We should go dance by him.
That's good, have a seat. Um, the doctor says it's gotta be a needle. You're just gonna have to be brave, ok? Can you do that for me?
Is it me? Is it like I have some sort of beacon that only dogs and men with severe emotional problems can hear?
You would not. I can't believe this. I hate this, you're too normal. I can't believe my boyfriend doesn't have a thing. My boyfriend doesn't have a thing.
Yeah, well, I'm using noise. Okay. All right! So, is everybody ready? Here we go. I hear something! I hear something! Where is it?
I wish we at least knew his name... Look at that face. I mean, even sleeping, he looks smart. I bet he's a lawyer.
Okay, just to be clear comedy with the plates will not be well recieved. Ross makes some sort of sound to let us know it hurt.
I mean I have not been picked on this much since kindergarten and they had to bring in someone from junior high to do the see-saw with me.
You actually broke her watch? Wow! The worst thing I ever did was, I-I shredded by boyfriend's favorite bath towel.
That's because their nerves are probably deadened from being so stupid. But hey, y'know if you don't believe me, please, by my guest.
And Ross, if it weren't for Rachel's rumor I mean no one in high school would even know who you were. She put you on the map!
Paolo, I really hate you for what you did to Rachel, but I still have five of these, so heat it at 375 until the cheese bubbles.
"Tonight's the night we're gonna make it happen, tonight we'll put all other things aside. Give in thistime and show me some affection..."
This is great! Now she's gonna be mad at Rachel! Y'know what? And I'm just gonna swoop in there and be like the daughter she never had.
I'll get everybody else , finally we can start celebrating my- I'm sorry, uh apparently I've opened the door to the past.
Yes! Absolutely. Okay? Look, you'll know it's mine because on the right cup, the lacey part, there's a very noticeable rip.
Okay, we've been out here for two hours and we haven't seen any stupid comets. Can we go now? I mean, Chandler's getting chilly.
Why don't you phase it out? Yeah, fade the accent out and people will think you're, y'know, that you're adjusting to life in America.
Well, um, look I-I don't want this to come our wrong, but ah, you seem awfully confident for a guy I just told I wasn't attracted too.
I don't know. Look he's a great guy and I love being with him but... you know. Things happen, and they happen. You don't plan these things.
Oh God! Orange juice just came out of my nose, but it was totally worth it. Oh my God, I completely forgot about your sound.
Well, I don't care! That-that turkey has to feed 20 people at my parent's house and they're not gonna eat it off your head!
Or, it could mean that-that you saw Chandler and me together and we y'know were being close and stuff and then you just want to have that with someone too.
When girls hang out, we don't have pillow fights in our underwear. I'm sorry. We do. We do. I don't know why I said that.
Look at these authentic fake medals. I tell ya, mom's gonna be voted best dressed at the make-believe military academy.
Really? But tomorrow night is the only night I get off from the restaurant. If you go to the game, we won't have a night together for another week.
Okay, fine. Let's talk about snow. -- Do you think it's snowing in Tulsa, where my husband is having sex on a copying machine?
Noo!! It's driving me crazy. I mean every other way he's like the perfect guy, he has everything. Plus! He actually has everything.
All right people, we're in trouble here. We've only got 12 hours and 36 minutes left. Move, move, move!
Yeah. Anyway, he told me about your apartment. And, um, I couldn't sleep, thinking about it. So, uh, would it be okay if I cleaned it?
No! No you should! A lot of major actors do nude scenes! I mean the chance to star in a movie? Come on!
A jazz trio for cocktails. The Bay City Rollers for dancing. Wait, that was from my sixth grade wedding.
I know, I know. I'm just so tired of-of missing him. I'm tired of wondering why hasn't he called. Why hasn't he called!
We're not gonna have sex! Okay, nothing's changed here. He still doesn't want children and I still do, so that's why we're just gonna be friends.
What's to know? Buy sell, high low, bears bulls... Yes Manhattan...yeah telephone number of the stock...selling store.
YOU BET YOUR ASS I AM! I just had the best first day ever! The kitchen: twice as big as Allessandro's.
Okay, everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor. This is everybody, this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my brother Ross?
I'm his sister, okay? I love him! I don't want to see him get hurt! Come on! Doesn't that give me the right to control him-help him?
Oh yeah! I saw her walkin' it down the street the other day. She had uh, these flowers in the basket. It was so cute.
Terrible. If-if I want something done right, I have to do it myself. Other people just wreck stuff. I really think I might kill someone tonight.
Well I'm not sure yet, but umm of the top of my head I'm thinking double sided tape and some sort of luncheon meat.
Joey they're not real. I start miles beneath the surface of these things, ok, they're fake. See honk honk.
Sit down. All right? Please, just listen to me. You are terrible at this! Okay? You are the worst ultimate fighter ever! Ever!!
Are you kidding?! I practically spent my entire childhood at the arcade! This is like-Oh my, this is like my second favorite game!
If we wanna get on camera, I think we have to get up on one of those platforms. They've been taping those people up there all day.
Fine! Don't be my friends! I'll buy new friends! Yeah, and then I'll pay for their plastic surgery so they'd look just like you!
Of course I wouldn't approve, I mean, you were totally in love with this guy who, hello, was gay. I mean, what the hell were you thinking?
I'm getting married today!!! I think I just cracked a rib. But I don't care because today's my wedding day! My day is finally here!!
Oh good you're all here. Thanksgiving tomorrow, four o'clock. Oh, guess who I invited. Remember that guy Will Colbert from high school?
So what, he's a little older, big deal, I mean he's important to me. Ya know if you ask him, he might take you on his Jag.
No, no, no. Honey, I'm ok. Shake it off! Oh, no! No shaking, no shaking! Ooh! Ooh! Oh my God! I can't play!
Of course it was! Trust me, when it comes to psychology I know what I'm talking about. I took two psych classes in college.
Hey. It's three in the morning. They don't know that I've come home yet. You notice how neither one of them are wondering where I am.
Well, he did this bit... You probably had to be there, but it was Liza Minelli locked in our freezer, eating a raw chicken.
Really Phoebs? Because, you know, you'd have to be an actual waitress. This can't be like your 'I can be a bear cub' thing.
Here. Ben, do you wanna play the airplane game, do you wanna show Rachel? Come here. We're gonna do something fun. Okay. Weee!! Weee!!
All right! Okay, it's just Phoebe. Will's still on a diet, Chandler doesn't eat Thanksgiving food, and Rachel's having her aversion to poultry.
Ok, so that's what we're doing. You know, when I'm in the coffee house bopping along to one of your songs, I'm wearing ear plugs.
Well, she actually has a boyfriend y'know herself, named Clark. Uh, she also kinda invited herself to our wedding. Clark too.
That is a wonder. So tell me something, Mom. If you had to do it all over again, I mean, if she was here right now, would you tell her?
Oh my God! You are gonna love me so much! I felt really bad about the whole bachelorette party thing, so tonight you're gonna have a bachelor party.
No!! Why didn't you make a copy and-and keep it in a fireproof box and keep it at least a hundred yards from the original?!!
Well then, y'know what? I care about you to much to watch you hurt yourself like this. So if you have to do this, then you're gonna have to do it without me.
Well, you're... you're different funny... I mean, you're... you're more sarcastic a-a-and... well, he does... bits... and impressions... and... and limericks...
This is Rachel. I mean, what are you gonna do, never going to talk to her again? I mean I know it's weird, it's awkward, but you gotta at least try.
Oh look, the pool table's free. Rack 'em up. I'll be back in just a minute. Get ready for me to whip your butt.
Ohh! Umm, Phoebe, I kinda need to talk to you about that. Umm, well I-I-I think it might be time for me to take a step back from catering.
I'm sorry, they just, they just look so good! And the saleswoman was looking at me like, "Oh, these are way too expensive for you."
Ohh, she's looking down the hall. Oh! She looked right at me! Oh wait, you can't see people through that little hole, can you? Hello!
Oh yeah, she didn't hire me out of pity, it wasn't so she could pick on me in front of her friends, she actually thinks I'm good.
No, no, no. They say it's the same as the distance from the tip of a guy's thumb to the tip of his index finger.
Okay! The movers will be here in 11 hours. Rachel has not packed. Now, everybody has to help! Chandler, we're gonna start with...
Oh no no, this is not for him, this is for me. That way he's still sober but I find his stories about shoelaces much more amusing.
Oh, it's a great party! Great food. Y'know, most parties it's all chips and salsa, chips and salsa. So umm, what's this?
Oh, Rach! Rach! Umm hey, could you do me a favor and would talk to Chandler's dad and try to keep him away from Chandler's mom?
The second that Ross walks in that door, I want you take him back to your bedroom and do whatever it is that you do that makes him go, rweee!!
So wait, Ross's stuff is fine, but I have no memories because you wanted to keep the bottom two inches of your car away from water!!!
Hey guys! You found the presents? Chandler, you let them find the presents? Great! Do you know how long it took me to find you that water purifier?
It's gotta be one of a kind. Y'know like umm, y'know uh, what's that God awful ceramic fruit bowl she has on her counter?
All right then, go fight for her! Go to London! I mean, that could be you and Emily! That, but-but nicer. Just, go to London!
No! Y'know, the fantasy! Meet someone from a strange land, fall in madly love, and spend the rest of your lives together.
Y'know, I really have to tell Rachel, but I... We just have to get it over with! Y'know, the next time we see them we're just gonna tell them. Okay? That's it.
Well, so far I have uh, my bride's maids dresses won't get picked up, my veil gets lost, or I don't have my something blue.
You know everything!! Oh wait, double or nothing. I bet you the baby is over seven pounds. I bet you it has hair. I bet you it's a girl.
Hey, isn't weird to think about how next year at this time they'll be a little baby at the table? Rachel's! But good to know where you're at!
Oh, well... um, that's all there are of these. But in about eight and a half minutes, we'll be serving some delicious onion tartlets.
Let me think. Oh, when I was younger I used to dream that I got married to Mayor McCheese, and on our wedding night I ate his head.
Well umm, they both have a egg yolk and butter base, but a bearnaise has shallots, shirvel, and most importantly tarragon.
That is completely untrue. You think I'm high maintenance? Okay, prove it. I want you to make a list and we're going to go through it point by point!
I thought I was making headway, everyone was smiling at me all day, I get off work and I find out that they wrote this on my chef's hat.
If you have the big apartment you have to deal with people coming over all the time. That fridge has got to be stocked, okay, that's your department now.
Okay! Very funny! Somebody let me out please?! Come on, I'm cold! And covered in marinara sauce! Come on! Let me out!
It's not like I want to get married tomorrow! It's just that I-I'd like to believe that I'm in a relationship that's actually going somewhere, that I'm not just wasting my time!
Hello? Oh, Hi, Ju Hi, Jew! Uh huh? Uh huh? Ok. Um, sure, that'd be great. See ya then. Bye.
Well now, I get to spend my shower with the only people I really love! I mean, I get all those presents without having to talk to people I don't even like!
No I totally disagree. No I think it's fine for a guy to do something like that. Such you an actor. Not that you need to,your eyebrows are...
Wait a minute, just because he paid for your head shots you're gonna take him? Joey, I don't think you're comprehending just how slutty this dress is!
Honey, we've been trying to have a baby for over a year. I think it's a good idea to find out if everything's ok. Just a few routine tests.
When two people finally realise their feelings for each other, and-and they talk for hours, and they-they learn all about the other person!
Nooo! Never! I mean, we're living in the moment. God, it is so nice for once to not have to get all hung up on 'Where is this going?'
It's worse. The only thing that's getting me through is knowing that I'm gonna be seeing you soon. I think I may even try to get out of here early.
Oh, please, stop! Look, we're supposed to be honest with each other. I-I just wish you could tell me-just say, "I don't like your massages."
Well, my breasts are going to get bigger weather you like it or not! And you know what? It's not just my breasts. My ass is going to get bigger too.
Yes! Every year Ross makes the toast, and it's always really moving, and always makes them cry. Well this year I'm going to make them cry.
This baby has got everything. Take y'know, locations for instance. First, organized alphabetically, then geographically, then by square footage.
Oh, what a great argument, exhaling! All right, y'know what, I'll prove it to you, okay. I'll trade you Joey for Rachel, and I'll still win the game.
Yeah. In fact, I like her so much you tell her I want my cookies early this year! Y'know, a box of Thin Mints and some Tag-a-Longs.
Umm, actually I was about to tell you that I was, I was going to get out of it, but hey, if we're just goofing around then uh, maybe I will go out with him.
Oh umm, that's because I just wanted to y'know walk in on me and Chandler while we were, y'know, doing it all night. Will you excuse me for just a second?
Myself. Y'know for remembering to pack a thing. Yeah, you do a good thing, you get a check! My mom does it, I never realised it was weird.
Nothing, I'm just trying to recreate some of the fun that we had at my place the other day. Remember, when you picked Rachel over me? That was funny.
Uh, look, Larry honey, umm, I wrote the book on Section 5 and I know that you don't have to wear your hat unless you're in the kitchen.
Hey, the point is that he was at everyone of your swim meets and he was there cheering you on! Okay? That's a, that's a pretty great dad.
Um, yeah, so uh, uhh, listen, I'm sorry I didn't tell you this before but umm, I, I'm no longer at my job, I, I had to leave it.
Well, we're trying to find someone to perform our wedding and they're all either boring or annoying or y'know, can't stop staring at the ladies.
Wow, that's a big cable bill! Huh, you don't have a job, but you have no problem ordering porn... on a Saturday afternoon?! I was in the house!
Could you please tell me what this is in reference to? Yes, hold on. Um, they say there's been some unusual activity on your account.
De-caff. Okay, everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor. This is everybody, this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my brother Ross?
Listen umm, I've been thinking, it's not fair for me to ask you to spend all of your money on our wedding. I mean, you work, you work really hard for that.
Y'know what, I've got to walk out of here right now, 'cause getting over you is the hardest thing that I have ever had to do. I don't think I could do it again.
You would not believe my day! I had to work two shifts, and then to top it off, I lost one of my fake boobs, in a grill fire.
I know! It's just that...ever since high school Rachel was the one person I told everything too. Y'know? I miss that so much now. She's my best friend.
Look. I'm sure there's some friendly way to reconcile this! Um, have a seat. First of all, we haven't been introduced, I'm Monica Geller.
I think it's totally insane, I mean, they work for the hospital. It's like returning to the scene of the crime. You know, I say we blow off the dates.
Exactly. Oh, I love that I can be totally neurotic around you now. Tell me the truth. Don't you like it better now that everything on your desk is perpendicular?
Fine! If you want me to wear the boots, I'll wear the boots. In fact, I'll go into my room right now and y'know try the outfit on.
What don't you just calm down Phoebe! All right?! Why don't you just get all your facts before you run around telling everybody that you're the only hot couple!!
Well you know it's just like living with a girl. Only they don't steal your makeup. Unless they're playing "This is what my sister would look like"
Oh, friends first, drunk in London, you know the story. I've got a better question for you: Do you or any of your blood relatives have diabetes?
Wait a minute! Unless, we give her all gifts she can use after she's done being pregnant. Like-like umm, regular coffee, Tequila.
Man, this sucks! Y'know if Mom and Dad don't see us on TV after we made them so jealous, I mean, who's gonna be the losers then?
Because I know that you think the lottery is "boohaki" but we're all here and gonna watch the numbers and have fun. And you're my brother, and I want you to be a part of this.
What?! Are you crazy? You just had Ross's baby! It's-it's so inappropriate. No, it's worse than that. It's wrong. It's... It is bigger than mine!
All right, eight we get married, but 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12 we don't get married.
Why did I 'woo-hoo'? I mean, what was I hoping would happen? That-that he'd turn round and say 'I love that sound, I must have you now'?
Did you hear that?! They bumped them up to first class because they are on their honeymoon! Come on! Let's act like we're on our honeymoon.
Yeah! You already got the first class tickets; you got the lounge! I mean we should get free stuff too! I mean you're not the only ones on your honeymoon!
This wasn't addressed to Days of Our Lives, this is, this came to your apartment. There's no stamp on it, this woman was in our building.
Oh, what'd ya bring me?! Awww, hotel toiletries from Japan. Oh, these are gonna go in my permanent collection. You want some coffee?
Okay. Oh but Joey, come over later because I'm going to teach you to make a bird feeder out of just a pine cone and some peanut butter.
It's so good, that I feel really selfish about being the only one who's eating it, that I think we should have everyone taste how good it is. Especially Ross.
Okay, I gotta go find Rachel but umm, if you guys see her could you please try to give her some really bad news so that mine doesn't seem so bad?
Hello? Oh, hi Wendy! Yeah, eight o'clock. What did we say? Ten dollars an hour?... OK, great. All right, I'll see you then. Bye.
Ya know, my party is fun. I mean, maybe it's a little quieter, less obvious sorta fun but, you know, if people would just give it a chance...
Y'know what? After you're with this woman for like ten minutes, you forget all that. I mean, she is this astounding person, with this, with this amazing spirit.
Okay. No need to panic. Deep breathes everyone. Okay umm uh, we're just gonna have to spend some time and put the CDs in the right cases.
Ohh, I'm so glad. Thank you so much for staying so calm during this. I mean it's really, it's made me stay calm. I coulda been worse!
Anyway, we're really excited about our wedding plans, and well I guess pretty soon we'll be making a big withdrawal from the Monica wedding fund. What?
All right uh, the important thing is to take your time, you want to hit 'em all, and you mix 'em up. You gotta keep them on their toes.
Chandler is supposed to find out if he's getting an assistent job at his ad agency. But out of the 15 interns, they are only hiring three.
They want me to do it, which is really cool, seeing as I've never catered before, and I really need the money, and this isn't a problem for you, is it?
Ok, for my next song I think I'll sing something a little more upbeat. All right? Oh, how about the PointerSisters "I am so excited". And make it bouncy!
See Chandler? I'm getting a lot of use out of them already! They're very practical. See, you can wear them with dresses, with skirts, with pants...
All right, we still have a minute and a half to go, and we're down by two points. Two points.... Phoebe you do a button-hook again. Rachel, you go long.
You can't say that!! You-you don't know!! I mean I thought I was gonna pass out from the pain! Anyway I-I tried, but I-I couldn't...bend that way. So...
Phoebe, it's okay. You don't have to tip toe around me. I-I've been thinking about it and umm, y'know what? I'm okay about not having that new relationship feeling...
That was that girl Megan! She booked the Swing Kings on the day of our wedding and said that I couldn't have them back unless I gave her the dress!
Okay so this is where the band is. And this is where the bar is. And all these pins have people's names on them. And Rach, here you are.
The woman from the museum called and said that there was a cancellation and that we could move up our wedding and Chandler heard! I know! How bad is this?!
Yeah Joey she's...Rachel's got this really big work problem, and it is a head scratcher. Wow! Y'know what, if we're gonna make dinner we're gonna have to leave. Yeah.
Okay, here's batch 22. Ohh, maybe these'll taste a little like your grandmother's. This has a little bit of orange peel, but no nutmeg.
I know...God. I haven't seen my savings take a hit like this since I was a kid and they came up with double-stuffed Oreos. What happened to all our money?
Oh, But you're finally doing something that you love! I can't ask you to give that up. Though it'd be nice if the thing that you love was y'know... finding gold.
"Hi, uh, Richard it's Monica, um, listen I did something kind of crazy tonight, um, maybe I'm getting my period or something, I don't know." Nooo!!
No no, the father can, but um, since I am the roommate I can tell you that she's not here and I'll pass along the message, ok. So bye-bye.
Sure. Oh, um, Chandler? Y'know, the-the old Monica would-would remind you to scrub that Teflon pan with a plastic brush...But I'm not gonna do that.
Yes. I hated you. I mean I, I, loved you in a 'you're my brother so I have to' kind of way, but basically, yeah, I hated your guts.
Okay, guys, listen, don't forget that tomorrow is the day that Emily gets married again, so whatever we do, just try to really keep Ross's mind off of it.
No. I don't think that you and I were destined to end up together. I think that we fell in love and work hard at our relationship. Some days we work really hard.
Are you trying to tell me that we're moving to Oklahoma, or that you're gay? All right, not that this matters, but did they at least offer you a huge raise?
Okay, forget the specials for a minute. Umm, all right here's the thing, for the last two weeks I have umm, tried really hard to create a positive atmosphere...
Okay, the owner of Allesandro's came over to yell at me, but instead I made him some sauce, and he offered me the job as head chef!!
Why? It's just that I've waited seven years for an opportunity like this, and you can't even wait four and a half minutes for a stupid onion tartlet?
Okay ah, please don't freak out. Umm, but ah, there's a blue fingernail in one of the quiche cups, and there's no way to know which one.
All right fine. Fine, I'll do it. I've just got to get this off the screen. Carol and Susan are still upset that you taught him pull my finger.
Okay. It's-it's about Alan. There's something that you should know. I mean, there's really no easy way to say this.. uh.. I've decided to break up with Alan.
So, I'll get candles and my mom's lace tablecloth, and since it's Rachel's birthday, I mean, we want it to be special, I thought I'd poach a salmon.
No. No, just, just, just a couple more boxes. It-it-it's no big deal, all right, I'm-I'm cool. You gotta help me out with a couple more boxes!
Yeah, I got this number from this guy at work and I hired a stripper to come dance for you. Am I going in the wife hall of fame or what?!
I-I'm not gonna be able to make it into work today, I don't feel very good. Yes!! Wow! Uh, for a second there I thought I was really better, but I'm not.
Be that as it may, d'you think you could just help us out here on that monkey thing? Y'know, just for old times' sake? Go Bobcats?
Well, if you're gonna be totally rational about this, I can't argue with you! All right? Fine, if you wanna tell him, tell him. I just don't want to be a part of it.
How do you think I am?! You've wrecked all my childhood memories. You love Ross more than me. And I just rubbed a dead mouse on my face!
Oh, about five minutes. Right now they're interviewing his opponent. Apparently he trains by going to Iran and pulling the arms off thieves.
Whoa-whoa-whoa, Phoebe you gotta take her! Y'know I-I-I said some really bad stuff about her, but y'know Rachel has some good qualities that make her a good roommate.
: Oh well this is the only one they had at our video store, but they did have something called crocodile killers. Or does it always have to be sharks?
Okay Ben, why don't you come open some more presents, and Santa, the Armadillo, and I have a little talk in the kitchen? There's a sentence, I never thought I'd say.
Are you kidding? This is where they get out stains! Okay? This is like Disneyland for me. I'm-I'm gonna be over here watching the dance of the clean shirts.
Oh my God! You cleaned! Look at these floors! You did the windows! Oh, I have been begging you for months and you did! You cleaned! And nagging works!
Lewis Posin! He was my best friend in fifth grade, and-and then one day I asked him to be my boyfriend and he said no. Do you know why?
You're the most wonderful man. And if you hadn't of said 'if I have to' like seventeen times, then I'd be saying 'okay, let's do it.'
I can't wait to be with you! I'll sneak over as soon as Ross picks up Ben. I'll just tell Rachel I'm gonna be doing laundry for a couple of hours.
Hey, Joey, I don't think that you should leave Chandler alone. I mean it's only been two days since he broke up with Kathy. Maybe you can go fishing next week?
Chandler... In all my life... I never thought I would be so lucky. As to...fall in love with my best...my best... There's a reason why girls don't do this!
Y'know, all these years, I thought you were on my side. But maybe what you were doing was sucking up to Mom and Dad so they'd keep liking you better!
Wait a minute, Phoebe! We should be partners. We should be catering partners. I mean, think about it! You're not working right now, and we have such a great time together!
Hi, Dad. No, no, it's me. li-listen, Dad, I can't talk right now, um, but there's something, um... there's something that I've been meaning to tell you...
Hey, have you guys eaten, because uh, Richard and I just finished and we've got leftovers... Chicken and potatoes... What am I wearing?...Actually, nothing but rubber gloves.
Ok, Mike, enough is enough, now you love Phoebe and she loves you, so you need to get over your whole "I never want to get married" thing and step up!
All right, let's be practical, if Ross isn't willing to do it, he's not the only guy in the world you can have sex with. You can borrow Chandler-Chandler is good!
You invite my brother, you invite my whole family, and not me?! Why?! What-Why wouldn't you want me at your wedding? What could I have possibly done?! Stuart!
Actually there is. Chandler usually helps me with this, but he's really into the game so I don't want to bother him. Could you help me fold these napkins?
If you would stop thinking about Ross for one minute you would notice that there are great guys everywhere! I mean, look! Look, Gunther! I mean, he's nice, he's cute.
But I'm gonna be there... for the rest of my life. I mean, I can't break up with him. I'm the one who made him quit drinking. He's dull because of me.
Listen uh, I-I've been doing some thinking, and I don't know whether it's because we're here or Rachel's giving birth but umm, I think we should try to have a baby.
OK, look. That is Aunt Iris. This woman has been playing poker since she was five. You gotta listen to every word she says. Hi!
Okay Ben, why don't you come open some more presents, and Santa, the Armadillo and I have a little talk in the kitchen? There's a sentence I'd never thought I'd say.
I mean they're trying to do everything they can to make me quit, and if there were any other job, I would. But this is something I've been waiting for my whole life.
Oh well umm, I make it myself! It's two parts ammonia and one part lemon juice. And now the secret ingredient is...y'know what? We just met.
I actually know someone in advertising. I grew up with this guy who is a vice president at a big agency. Maybe I can get him to meet you? Give me the phone.
Ah, well if you don't clear this off, you won't be getting one of those from me. But Ben's coming over here tomorrow to play this game, this can't be there.
Yeah, well, I'll take a little crying any day over Howard-the-"I-win"-guy. "I win! I win!" I went out with the guy for two monthsI didn't get to win once.
No, thank you! You have given me so much! I mean, if it wasn't for you, I would never have gotten to sing Memories on the stage at the Wintergarden Theater!
Okay, I got that. I'll escape over there. I'll come back over here. All right, come on Ms. Pac-Man. It's got-Right- Well, you're just a little bitch, aren't you?
We'll try to be more careful okay? It's just that, we don't want everyone to know because this is going really well, and maybe the reason it's going really well is because it's a secret.
But I need it. Otherwords I'm gonna have to take that horrible diner job. You know, with the dancing and the costumes. I don't wanna have to wear flame retardant boobs.
Anyway, Ross and I were always captains, and um, it got kind've competitive and one year, Geller Bowl VI, I accidentally broke Ross's nose.
: he has to work, there's some rush on the big ah damn it one of these days I'm really gonna have to start listening when he talks about his job.
You know what? I take back what I said before. You keep playing at the restaurant, because with your music driving people inside, my bar sales are going up like crazy.
No. No. Not it. Not it. Not it. Don't crowd me! This is it! This is the dress! Oh my God, it's perfect! I'm sorry, this one's taken! Whoa!
All right then, then nothing changes! Everything is great! Everything stays the same! And you go unpack because it's been three days and it's driving me insane!
Oh, why does this bother me so much? I mean I don't wanna be one of those people who tells their boyfriend they wanna spend 24 hours a day with them.
Chandler, you're not fourteen anymore. Okay? Maybe it's time that you let that stuff go. If your father's not at your wedding...you're gonna regret it for the rest of your life.
Yes! Yes! And I think that the first gift that Rachel opens should be from the grandmother of the baby, because you're the most important person in this room. And in the world!
Hmm, no. I mean how can I accept a restaurant from him? I-I-I-I can't. I couldn't even accept a necklace from Stu Vincent in the seventh grade.
Chandler, here you go, got your traditional Thanksgiving feast, you got your tomato soup, your grilled cheese fixin's, and your family size bag of Funyuns.
Well, instead of being sad that tonight is my last night together with Rachel we thought we'd go out to dinner and celebrate the fact that Rachel is moving in with Phoebe.
It's great! How? Chandler. Well my boss and I worked out a deal where I only have to be in Tulsa four days a week, so the other three I can be here with you.
Man, I would be great in a war! I mean, I really, I think I would make a fantastic military leader. I mean I know I would make General way before any of you guys.
Tell him that you haven't seen your wife in a long time. Tell him that having a long-distance relationship is really difficult. Tell him that what little time we have is precious.
Any time you want. Y'know, when I was younger, all I wanted to do was to play with this dollhouse, but no!! It was to be looked at, but never played with.
Yeah hey, a weird thing happened today whey I was at brunch. This woman overheard that I was marrying you and-and then she...she wished me good luck.
Whew. Although y'know, this is part of a salt and pepper set. I mean... I guess y'know it may just count as a half a present. What do you think?
That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong. Y'see, he's the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born.
I know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish, but, were you planning on bringing up the whole baby/lesbian thing? Because I think it might take some of the heat off me.
I just can't believe you're in here. I mean, what am I gonna do without you? Who's gonna crash the embassy parties with me? Who's gonna take me to the Big Apple Circus?
Oh my God, the cat's made my eyes water! Don't-don't throw it to me! My vision's been compromised!! Oh God! Okay. Okay. It's okay. Man, that was close.
Honey I can't even imagine how hard this must be for you. But, I don't want you to lose Joey over it. And right now he just needs to know that you're still his friend.
Umm, I just wanna say, uh that with a pinch of exictement, a dash of hard work, a dollup of cooperation, we can have the recipe... Are you gonna kill me?
You say 'Thank you very much,' and then you buy me something pretty. Come on, we're gonna put are hands in this bowl, and we're gonna start squishing the tomatoes.
Who? I mean have you seen a car come by here in the last hour and a half? I think we should call Ross, maybe he can get a car and come pick us up.
Okay, sperm donor number 03815, come on down! Okay, he's 6'2", 170 pounds, and he describes himself as a male Geena Davis.
Oh my God. Phoebe. Don't look now, but behind us is a guy who has the potential to break our hearts and plunge us into a pit of depression.
Just going over my toast. Those two will never know what hit 'em. I can't wait. They're going to be crying so hard. They're going to be fighting for breath.
Hey! Joey said no autographs! But if she's gettting one, then I want one too: To Monica. And none of this "best wishes" crap. I want "love".
You know, Rachel, when you ran out of your wedding, I was there for you. I put a roof over your head, and if that means nothing to you... twenty dollars an hour.
This is Monica! I'm Phoebe's friend. Listen, Phoebe is back with David and he's going to propose to her, and she is going to say "yes" but I know she really wants to be with you!
For this weekend! Oh gosh, it would be perfect, we get to see Joey plus we get to start our anniversary celebration on the plane. We can call it out plane-aversary.
So, I went down to the post office, and it turns out it was those videos that I ordered for Richard about the Civil War. He loved the Civil War.
How dirty do you think I am? I'm telling you, if you had some candles and some bubbles and some music, you would love it! It would take all of your stress away.
Please... Chandler is the love of my life... ... oooh leather pants! Have Mercy! Ross: So, eh... it's probably gonna be hard for you to leave Boston, huh?
Y'know what? You're right, I'm sorry. Actually you were a big help tonight. Yeah, and thanks for putting my grandmother in the cab and making sure she got to the hotel safely.
So, I read this article in the paper the other day that says you're not supposed to throw rice at weddings, because when pigeons eat rice it kills them.
So I did tell you. Okay, y'know, that really isn't the thing. Umm, the thing is that, right now I'm just in a place in my life where I need to focus on me. Y'know what I mean?
Honey, you know I think you're hilarious! Come on, you know that joke you told me last week? The one about Jerry Lewis and the girl with the lazy eye...? That slayed me.
Look, I'm not happy about this either, but y'know if-if Ross says he's happy then we're just gonna have to keep our feelings about Emily to ourselves. Are you cool with that?
Oh no sweetie, no! This is my fault, I wasn't clear! I'm really sorry. And listen, you take as much time as you need to move out okay? There's absolutely no rush.
Hi! I'm Monica and I'm gonna be singing "Delta Dawn""Delta Dawn, what's that flower you have on? Could it be a faded rose from days gone by? ..."
Then you two can, can sneak into the cockpit, and things will start to heat up, and then a stewardess comes in... I've been watching too much porn.
Lips moving, still talking. I mean it may not be ideal, but I'm so ready. No, I-I-I see the way Ben looks at you. It makes me ache, you know?
Maybe because you used to be aloof, or that you're really sarcastic, or that, y'know, you joke around all the time. Or that you take off your clothes and throw them on the couch.
My God, I can't believe this! I mean I knew that mom and dad were invited, but I thought that was it! I mean from the ages 7 to 9 Frannie and I were inseparable!
Y'know, you called me that before so I-I took the liberty of fashioning a star out of aluminum foil. Now, no pressure, you like my cookies, you give me the star.
Okay, I'll see you tomorrow! Just so you know, we're not seeing him tomorrow. I-I cannot spend another evening with that man. Do you remember how he behaved at our wedding?
Really? Weird. Anyway, see, I planned everything really well. I planned and I planned and I planned. It just turns out, I don't think I planned enough time to actually do it.
Oh, and the people are so nice. There's this one guy, Geoffrey, he's the Maitre D., Chandler, you will love him. He is without a doubt, the funniest guy I have ever met.
What is the matter with you?!! Why aren't you more upset?! Aren't you gonna be sad that we're not gonna be living together anymore?! I mean aren't you gonna miss me at all?!
As a joke, this customer at work who has a crush on me gave me a $20,000 tip. His number is on the check, he just did so I'd call him.
Ross and Rachel don't know what they're talking about. I mean its not like their so responsible. Emma is a product of a bottle of Merlot and a five year old condom.
Anyway um, when he left he forgot to take the poem with him. Now, I am like totally dense about poetry, but I think it's pretty good all right. Check it out.
Okay, I have looked through a bunch of career guides, photocopied and highlighted key passages and put them into alphabetical folders so you can make an informed decision.
No, that's not it. It's just that when we were asking him all those questions before, I just... I just realized I don't care if he's the most perfect guy in the world... he's not you.
I know that switch does something, okay? So-so I went down to city hall and got these. All I had to do was pay $25 and wait in line for three hours.
Look, when it started I was just trying to be nice to her because she was my brother's girlfriend. And then, one thing led to another and, before I knew it, we were...shopping.
Great! It's so amazing! I mean, last time Dr. Roger came over, I was so nervous, but then after being with you I'm all like, "Can the doctor see me now?"
Well umm, I was thinking that maybe we could come up with a system where we trade of being maid of honor for each other. Like hypothetically, if Phoebe were mine...
Pants and a sweater? Why, mom? Who am I gonna meet in a blackout? Power company guys? Eligible looters? Could we talk about this later? OK.
Well y'know, I'm just-I'm just worried that bosses will see them and think they pay you too much money. Or! Or your assistant will see them and-and want a raise!
So great! He showed me where the restaurant's going to be. It's this, it's this cute little place on 10th Street. Not too big, not too small. Just right.
You just told me that he hates marriage! That-that he's a-a complex fellow who's unlikely to take a wife! That-that he's against marriage and always will be!
That's because I-I was just grabbing some things out of the dryer, and it's static cling. Or maybe it's just that God knew I'd be running into you and saw an opportunity.
I'm a good person. And I'm a good chef, and I don't deserve to have marinara sauce all over me! Y'know what, if you want me to quit this bad, then all you have to do is...
Hi. Uh, my friend here was taking down our Christmas lights, and and she fell off the balcony and may have broken her foot or or ankle or something.
Oh no, it is okay, I mean as long as you know that Chandler and I are also very hot and fiery, just as hot as you! I mean our flame, whew, is on fire!
Please ... if I win the lottery, you guys are not gonna leave me. Someone gave me a basket of mini-muffins last week and I couldn't get rid of you for 3 days!
No, c'mon, we can't stop, c'mon, we've got three more pounds to go. I am the energy train and you are on board. Woo-woo, woo-woo, woo-woo Woo.
We thought since Phoebe was staying over tonight we'd have kinda like a slumber party thing. We got some trashy magazines, we got cookie dough, we got Twister...
It was so wild. We told them we were the Gunnersens in room six fifteen. Only to find out the Boston Celtics had taken over the entire sixth floor!
No, honey, in a wonderful way. You know what you want now. Most guys don't even have a clue. You are ready to take risks, you are ready to be vulnerable, and intimate with someone.
I think we are getting a little ahead of selves here. Okay. Okay. I am just going to get up, go to work and not think about him all day. Or else I'm just gonna get up and go to work.
You guys are always hanging out in my apartment! Come on, I'll only use my left hand, huh? Come on, wussies! All right, ok, I gotta go. I'm going, and I'm gone.
And when I told her that I was gonna be moving in with Chandler, she was really supportive. You were so great. You made it so easy. And now you have to leave. And I have to live with a boy!!
Do you wanna live outside?! Because it's gettin' cold! She gets tons of catalogs and umm, she'll fold down the pages of the things she thinks that I'd like.
Look, not that I enjoy talking about people who I went to high school with, 'cause I do, but umm, maybe we could talk about something else? Like you, I don't even know where you work?
No, if he doesn't like our cookies, too bad, I am not gonna be blackmailed. Look if worse comes to worse, it gets a little warm, we'll call it a theme party.
Go! I have it in my book. Go! Wait a minute! If you're in charge of the invitations why am I the one who has to call her-Hello Mrs. Green! Hi, it's Monica Geller.
No-no, wait! Just let me finish, okay? This isn't something that we just, we just impulsively decided in-in Vegas, this is something we both really want. And it is going to happen.
All right guys stop it. Rachel, we're very sorry that is a very insensitive thing for us to do. And y'know what? Let us make it up to you, we have two really great guys for you.
Well, you're making him a frieze salad with goat cheese and pine nuts, wild nuts, wild rice, roast asparagus, and salmon au croup.
Oh really, so that hysterical phone call I got from a woman at sobbing 3:00 A.M., "I'll never have grandchildren, I'll never have grandchildren." was what? A wrong number?
No that was Jarred! Wow! I haven't thought about him in a long time... Anyway, umm Will's, Will's here on business and he didn't have a place to go so I invited him here.
Nooo! Okay. Whoa! Okay. See I was, I was a little nervous about turning thirty. So the bus boys took me out for some drinks. I wanna puke on you later!
I know! And four ninety-nine for a pillow top queen set, who cares about the divorce, those babies will sell themselves. And I'm appalled for you by the way.
Well then somebody's snoozing. Joey, not that this uh should affect you at all, but if you were to pick me, I was planning on wearing a sequined dress, cut down to here.
Look Ross, the only question you need to ask is, "Do you see a future?" I mean like do you see yourself marrying her? Oh my God! You did it already! You married her, didn't you?!
No! No-no they're not. They're still very angry! But y'know Chandler is also half-Swedish. You know what the Swedish people are famous for? Sitting down and being quiet.
Uh, so, uh, Rach, uh... do you wanna save this wrapping paper, I mean, it's only a little bit torn... so are you gonna go for it with Ross or should I just throw it out?
Alright you two, I'm gonna go to the bathroom. Now I don't want anything going on while I'm gone. Here's a few things you can discuss: mucus, fungus and the idea of me and Ross doing it.
Maybe he's bothering you so much because he likes you. It's like in first grade when Skippy Langwild always pushed me on the playground because he secretly had a crush on me?
You bet your ass I'm gonna fire you! Get out of my kitchen! Get out!! All right! Anybody else got a problem? How 'bout you Chuckles? You think this is funny now?
That's Great. You know we don't need to talk about this now. Really, I mean this is, is so way, way, way, in the future, I'm talkin' hovercrafts and apes taking over the planet.
Hello Greg? Hi, this is Monica from the plane? Listen, the number that you gave me 853-5... That is their old number! Jenny's been giving it out since they moved!
This would be a beautiful place to get married, yeah, but I wouldn't put the aisle there and I would never have the ceremony there! I mean you'd have the ceremony under this big beautiful arch.
Just, I love you so much. Just...It's just sometimes it bothers me that I'm never gonna have that feeling. Y'know when you meet someone for the first time and it's new and exciting? Y'know that rush?
So what, you're not the only one. I mean, half the time we don't know where we're going. You've just gotta figure at some point it's all gonna come together, and it's just gonna be... un-floopy.
Okay, I-I'm sorry. You and Joey, your both focusing on this uncomfortable thing, what you need to do is to change the subject. Next time you see him try to get him talking about something else.
Well, I'll tell you what we're gonna do: We are already late for Phoebe's birthday dinner, so you point out put out that cigarette, we're gonna put this fight on hold and go have sex.
Ok, trying to turn me on by making a mess? Know your audience! Besides, tomorrow we're doing those fertility tests and until then you need to keep your tadpoles in the tank.
Ok, this is pumpkin pie with mockolate cookie crumb crust. This is mockolate cranberry cake, and these are mockolate chip cookies. Just like the Indians served.
Why would I say anything? That two of our best friends could start the greatest love affair of their lives! And they would have me to thank, and we could all start having babies?
Me? What are you talking about? Nobody could steal me from you. I mean, just because I'm friends with her doesn't make me any less friends with you. I mean, you're my...We're, we're...Oh, I love you.
Hey, wait a second. I can help you with this. You just need to be organized. We can make a list of your qualifications, and categorize jobs by industry. There could be folders and files!
I know. Hey, do you realize we may have just changed our lives forever? We may have just started a family. Nine months from now we can be here, having our own baby.
All right. Op, here it is! Right underneath the can of-of bug bomb. I wonder if the best place to put something that cooks food is underneath the can of poison?
Oh, he just doesn't want us to go through any trouble. Think of how excited he'll be when we go out and surprise him! Plus we get to have our own, ani-Vegas-ary! A-Nevadaversary!
Uh, Michelle. Yeah, that was me, I-I dialed your number by mistake. Oh, you're so sweet. Yeah, we were a great couple. I know I really miss him. Well, you know how it is, it's that....
Okay, this is the den. All right, check this out. Lights! Whoa! All right. Less lights! Bad lights! Lights go away! Oh, see you just need to find the right command.
Okay, maybe this will make your teeth look less white. Nope. Okay, colors that don't work are blue, yellow, green, red, black, white, orange, and purple.
Yeah, I think we're ready for our first course. OK, um, these are rot-shrimp ravioli, and celantro pondou sauce... ... with just a touch of mints... and... ... ginger.
Okay, Phoebe, y'know what? That-that's it, that's it, all right? No dinosaurs, no ghosts, no giant dogs, okay? They're not the right size, they're not Victorian, and they just don't go.
I also, did a little something in fur. But umm, that's really just for me. Okay. So, why don't you go into your room and try these on and we'll see-get a better idea of what's gonna work.
I just wanted to say that I hope you do have sex tonight and I hope that you guys get back together, but I must warn you, the night that you announce your engagement I'm going to announce that I'm pregnant!
I'm with you Chandler! I mean I can't have sex with a sick person either, that's disgusting! But I'm not sick! Let me prove it to you. We are two healthy people in the pribe of libe.
You're supposed to double the tax. Not double the tax of Romania. I mean, what's-what's the deal? Are you, are you trying to buy me? Is this the way you get girls to go out with you?
Honey, I don't think that's something we need to worry about! First of all he's-he's never gonna tell her how he feels about her. And even if he did you have no idea how she'd react.
It's okay. It's okay. Just pretend that it didn't happen! Okay? No one needs to know! I mean, Phoebe's not an official ballplayer! I mean, only official ballplayers can drop the ball!
No! But because he thought I was to faaaaa.... And every time I think about it, it makes me feel as bad as I did in fifth grade! Y'know, I-I really think that you should apologize to Julie.
See, this is why I told you never get involved with your assistant! And here is no such thing as keeping secrets when it comes to affairs. Did you hear that Chandler? No such thing!
Okay, y'know what, I'm not fine, I'm not. I mean how can I be fine, hearing you come in with her, she wants to see your bedroom.... Y'know what, what if we're friends who don't see other people?
No! No! No! No sweetie! No! Not like that! We're not at a barn dance. You've gotta-you wanna fold them like swans. Like I showed you at Christmas time, remember?
I've been doing a lot of thinking. A lot! And umm, well, I came up with a whole bunch of businesses you can do with your van. Okay umm, you could be flower delivery person.
All right, Rachel, I know-I know you think I'm crazy, please, before you tell him you love him, just-just try to find one person who thinks this is a good idea. Because I bet you, you can't.
Oh, this terrible! Everything is destroyed! Look at this. It obviously meant enough for me to save it, and I don't even know what it is! Ohh, it's still soft. What do you think this is?
Really? I'm really tired of being your relationship tutor. You're gonna have to figure this one for yourself. All right? Y'know what? If you're too afraid to be in a real relationship, then don't be in one.
We have to do this. We are playing for women everywhere. Okay, just think about every lousy date that you ever had, okay, every guy who kept on the TV while you're making out...
Hey, umm, so listen umm, my friends were telling me a little about this ah, ultimate fighting thing and it, well it sounds really dangerous. I-I don't want you to get hurt, 'cause I kinda like you.
Chandler look, I don't want to be one of those wives who says, "You can't go to the game. You have to spend time with me." So, if you could just realize it on your own . . .
No! But, they're callin' out to me! I mean this little guy even crawled up into my lap. Oh come on, Chandler wouldn't mind if I opened just one present! What do you think it is?
Windows are clean, candels are lit. Uh, belt's to tight, gotta change the belt. Did I turn the fish? No, cause I made lasagne. Am I out of control?
You don't know everything. Did you know that I'm going out with Rachel tonight instead of you? Hmm? And did you know that the only baby around here is you?! And did you know that I can't even look at you right now?!
Excuse us! Alright here's a question: Who was so worried about her restaurant being fancy that she made a big deal about her friend playing her music and feels really bad about it now?
Oh, stop beating yourself up! People make mistakes! These things happen! There aren't any message you've forgotten to give me are there? Apparently you're not very good at it! I...
I can't believe I did this. I can't believe I'm singing for the people, and they liked me! Hey, did you hear thatone shouting "look at those tips"! I mean, did I really help you get a lot of tips?
Alright, you see these little flower blossoms? They should be facing up, not down, because, well, the head of the bed is where the sun would be. You don't love me any more do you.
And, and, and they wear those little water wings, you know. And they're, they're running around on the deck. Then Hoyt wraps this big towel around all three of them.
Well,fall out of it. You know, you shouldn't even be here, it's a school night. Oh god, oh god. I'm like those women that you see with shiny guys named Chad. I'm Joan Collins.
I don't know! I don't-maybe you're feeling a little resentful. Maybe ah, maybe you thought you'd get married first! Maybe you can't stand the fact that your formally fat friend is getting married before you!
Oh my God, me too! Oh! Oh, we'd be like friends-in-law! Y'know what the best part is? The best part is that you already know everything about him! I mean, it's like starting on the fifteenth date!
Hi! If you're calling before Saturday, you've reached Monica and Chandler. But if you're calling after Saturday, you've reached Mr. and Mrs. Bing! Please leave a message for the Bings!
Well, Rachel wants to take swing dance lessons. Which I think is a really stupid idea! It's dangerous, she's never gonna get what she wants, and who knows who she might end up hurting.
Ok. Oh boy. You are doin' so good. You wanna squeeze my hand? All right, Ross, don't squeeze it so hard. Honey, really, don't squeeze it so hard! Oh, Ross! Let go of my hand!
It's not just the drum noise. Every five minutes, Joey throws his sticks in the air, and I have to hear, "Oh my eye! Oh god, my eye!" I mean, it is so annoying.
Oh please! Dad turned my room into a gym 20 minutes after I moved out! I gotta say, a tanning bed and a stack of Victoria's Secret catalogues, not a gym!
And y'know what, I just realised, in the last year I've only gone out with two guys, Richard and Julio. You gotta help me out here, you gotta set me up, you gotta get me back in the game.
Aunt Syl, stop yelling! All I'm saying is that if you had told me vegetarian lasagna, I would have made vegetarian lasagna. Well, the meat's only every third layer, maybe you could scrape.
Look honey, you don't have to do this, okay? It's the strength you have inside that means the most to me. You're loyal, you're honest, and you have integrity! That's the kind of strength that I want in the man that I love!
It took me 28 years to find one man that I wanna spend my life with, if I have to wait another 28 years then, I'll be 56 before I can have a baby, and that's just stupid.
What? Wait! Why? Chandler! Chandler! Wait! I'm sorry, I was just playing for one second! I was trying to find you to tell you that, look if you don't want me to see Richard again, I won't! He means nothing to me!
So, how'd the lasagne go over? Really?! Good. So you owe me three pretty things. Yeah, I've been thinking a lot about you too. I know. It's hard this whole platonic thing. It's a word!
Well, we just happen to go to alot of places where you might drink. I mean, how do you go to a wine tasting without having a drink? Or... or to a club, or to the... zoo.
Hello? No, he's not here. Yeah, this is his wife. Yeah, well, it came as quite a shock to me too. I guess I should have known. Yeah, I mean, he just kept making me watch Moulin Rouge.
You heard him! "No bigger!" "You're perfect!" "Just don't get any bigger!" Oh my god he sounded just like my high school wrestling coach. You know what? I'm going to have to talk to Chandler.
Aunt Syl, I did this as a favor, I am not a caterer. What do you want me to do with a dozen lasagnas? Nice talk, Aunt Syl. You kiss Uncle Freddie with that mouth?
That is exactly why I do not lend you stuff!! Okay?! I mean, first it's my jewelry! And if it's not my jewelry, it's-it's my blue sweater! And if it's not my sweater, it's my sunglasses!
Yes. Well I got his machine and I left a message. But it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, because you know it was like a casual, breezy message. It was breezy! Oh God, what if it wasn't breezy?
OK, wait, wait, wait, wait. You know what? Ross, let's - let's switch places. You get in the middle. No un-, ya know, unless this looks like we're trying to cover something up.
I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! Hi, Tim.
You don't tell me what to do! I tell you what to do! Just call her. She's at the Paradise Hotel in Barbados. And while I've got you, you've got curly hair. What do you do in humidity? Damnit!
I can't believe this, just like 2 weeks ago I was watching Sudden Death, now I'm on a date with Jean-Claude Van Damme. Can you beat up that guy? Can you beat up that guy?
What?! Ross y'know this isn't even about you! I mean this is about Rachel and something wonderful happening for her. I mean you know even if you're right, what if he wants to sleep with her, does it mean he gets too?
Oh honey, we're close now but you-you wouldn't believe the years of-of nugies, and wedgies, and flying wedgies, and atomic wedgies, and.... That's where the waistband actually goes over your head.
Well, I've tried everything. I give up. I guess I'm not gonna be the mom who makes the world's best chocolate cookies. I do make the best duck confit with broccoli rabe. Kids love that right.
All right. The super couldn't figure out what it did. A $200 an hour electrician couldn't figure out what it did. I've had seven pretty serious shocks. I officially give up.
Hey guys this stuff is just so way in the past. You-you've been through so much since then. And right now you've got so much more important stuff going on in your life. Can't you just let this go?
"Hi, it's Monica. I'm just checking in 'cause I got this message from you and I didn't know if it was old or new or what. So, I'm just checkin'. So let me know, or don't, whatever. I'm breezy."
Fortunately, it is me. And, they made me head of purchasing, thank you very much. Anyway, I just ran into Ross and Chandler downstairs, and they think we should go out and celebrate. You know, someplace nice.
All right that's it, I give up! Whatever you want you can have it! You wanna sing a song? You wanna do a dance? You want your mom stand at the Alter and scream racial slurs? I don't care!
Yeah. The great thing about the jam plan was, I was taking control of my life. So I asked myself, what is the most important thing to me in the world and that's when I came up with the baby plan.
Come here! Come here! Sweetie you don't have to worry. No, besides y'know what? I'm gonna have a lot of new things with you. The first time we buy a house. Our first kid. Our first grandkid...
I mean, why should I let them meet him? I mean, I bring a guy home, and within five minutes they're all over him. I mean, they're like- coyotes, picking off the weak members of the herd.
No, I can't afford this either. No. I-I-I'm, I'm just to figure out which one I want then I'm gonna get it at Kleinman's, this discount place in Brooklyn, day after tomorrow they are having a huge sale.
So Rach! You're the first guest at Hotel Monica! Umm, you'll just have to tell me how you like your eggs in the morning. And I thought I would bring them to you, y'know, in bed. Oh, you have been through so much.
You know what, maybe I don't need to have children. You know maybe I just think I do because that is what society, and by that I mean my mom, has always convinced me that I... I do, I have to have children, I'm sorry, I just do.
I'm the hostess! Not those guys! I'm always the hostess! I mean, I was always the hostess, I mean even when I was little, I mean the girls brought their dollies to my tea party, I-I served the best air.
It was soo amazing, he is so sexy, and smart, which makes him even sexier. Oh gosh, I gotta so you this. Last night, we were fooling around and he stops to write a poem.
Okay, I umm, I ran into Richard yesterday and he asked me if I wanted to go for a bite and I did. The only reason I didn't tell you is because I knew you'd get mad and I didn't want to spoil our anniversary.
Please, don't listen to Joey, okay. Would you look at him? He-he's obviously depressed. He's away from his family; he's spending Thanksgiving with strangers. What he needs right now is for you to be his friend.
I don't believe this! Wow, look at this refrigerator! It's gigantic! I mean I could live in this thing! I'd be cold, but I'm always cold. Oh my God, look at these spider burners! I love spider burners.
You went to one where you were popular, and you got to ride off Chip's motorcycle, and wear his letterman jacket. I went to one where I wore a band uniform they had to have specially made.
I just ran into Dave and he told me that you blew him off! I mean, you listen to me! Now, I'm calling the shots! I say you leave Ross alone and go get Dave! What the hell were you trying to do?
Listen you guys, I don't mean to be a pain about this but, um, I've noticed that some of you are just placing them on. You wanna push the caps until you hear them click. Gunther, where're you going?
No, you're right. Mnya, we shouldn't do it like this. Huch. For what it's worth, I'm, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have come down on you so hard about the smoking. So you had a few cigarettes, not the end of the world.
Okay. Could the waiters gather around to hear tonight's specials? Okay, first there is a Chilean Sea Bass prepared with a Mango relish on a bag-Why is nobody writing these down?
All right, that I'll retract. But I stand by my review, I know food and that wasn't it. You're marinara sauce tasted like tomato juice! You should serve it with vodka and a piece of celery.
Right. Umm, listen since we're-we-re on that subject, umm, I just wanted to tell you that uh, well, I-I was going through a really hard time in London, what with my brother getting married and that guy thinking I was Ross's mother...
This isn't easy for me either. I wish things were different, I... If you were a few years older, or if I was a few years younger, or if we lived in biblical times, I would really...
Honey, I'm not returning them. Okay? I mean I-I know they cost a lot, but I'm going to wear them all the time. You'll see. Besides, I love the compliments. I mean, have you ever had something so beautiful everyone wanted it?
This is so typical. Y'know, we give, and we give, and we give. And then- we just get nothing back! And then one day, y'know, it's just, you wake up, and "See you around!" Let's go, Phoebe.
Oh my God, it was the best funeral ever! I mean, everyone loved the food, and guess what? I even got another funeral for tomorrow-the dead-guy-from-today's best friend. I mean, it is like I am the official caterer for that accident!
Honey, umm I-I love you, but umm, if you call our wedding a party one more time, you may not get invited. Okay? Listen, we could always earn more money, okay? But uh, we're only gonna get married once.
Ugh, she's upstairs not doing the dishes! And I tell ya something! I'm not doing them this time! I don't care if those dishes sit in the sink until they're all covered with-I'll do them when I get home!
'Dear Dr. Remore, know that I love you and would do anything to have you.' Gosh. 'Your not-so-secretive admirer, Erica Ford.' Ooh wait, 'PS enclosed please find 14 of my eyelashes.'
Let's see. Congress is debating a new deficit reduction bill... the mayor wants to raise subway fares again... the high today was forty-five... and- oh, teams played sports.
Yeah, yeah, it's interesting.. but y'know what? Just for fun, let's see what it looked like in the old spot. Alright, just to compare. Let's see. Well, it looks good there too. Let's just leave it there for a while.
Yeah! I mean it was really funny, I-I just don't think you got it. You see Kara's coffee is-is-is weak tasting, okay? But-but what Doug was-was imply that it was weak physically. You get it now honey?
No, it is me! Y'know, I'm not just the person who needs to fluff the pillows and pay the bills as soon as they come in! Y'know, when I'm with her, I am so much more than that. I'm- I'm Monana!
Hi, who's this? Hi, Joanne. Is Rachel working? It's Monica. Yes, I know I did a horrible thing. Joanne, it's not as simple as all that, ok? No, I don't care what Steve thinks. Hi, Steve.
Well, there's a lot to think about. I mean, how is she, how is she going to handle this financially? How is she going to juggle work? Does she realize she's not going to have a date again for the next eighteen years?
Okay, fine but please don't be upset! Okay? I was really depressed okay? And really drunk! I just wanted something stupid and meaningless. I just wanted...just sex. So, when I...went to your room that night...I was actually looking...for Joey.
No! No! I shouldn't have even opened these! I mean I-Joey I am out of control!! Joey, you have to do me a favor. No matter what I say, no matter what I do, please do not let me open another present! Okay?
Of course not. I mean gosh, Chandler what you did, it's, it's a wonderful thing and I really appreciate it. I know I have this weird thing where I want everything to be in the perfect place, but I'd never expect you to worry about that.
Fine! Judge all you want to but, married a lesbian, left a man at the altar, fell in love with a gay ice dancer, threw a girl's wooden leg in a fire, livin' in a box!!
All right. Umm, you could uh start out with a little 1, a 2, a 1-2-3, 3, 5, a 4, a 3-2, 2, a 2-4-6, 2-4-6, 4, 2, 2, 4-7, 5-7, 6-7, 7 ...7.....7...7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7...!
I'm going into business people. I'm sick and tired of being depressed about Richard. I needed a plan, a plan to get over my man. What's the opposite of man? Jam. Oh Joey don't! It's way to hot.
All right. Umm, you could uh start out with a little 1, a 2, a 1-2-3, 3, 5, a 4, a 3-2, 2, a 2-4-6, 2-4-6, 4, 2, 2, 4-7, 5-7, 6-7, 7, ...7.....7...7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7...!
It's not like, I haven't any opportunities. I mean, y'know, I'm just waiting for the perfect guy. I'm seeing this guy Roger, all right? He's not perfect, but umm, I think maybe I should just get it over with. Y'know, give him my flower.
All right, I'll take one box of the mint treasures, just one, and that's it. I-I started gaining weight after I joined the Brown Birds. Remember, how Dad bought all my boxes and I ate them all?
No! No, she doesn't. Uh Phoebe, what she makes-that's uh-they're sock rabbits. They are completely different-Okay! Okay! Okay! I didn't make it! I'm sorry! I totally forgot about tonight and the fact that we're supposed to make the presents!
Um, okay. You just called a little while ago about needing a signature on the admissions form. Well, it turns out we need a whole new one because uh, you see, I-I, I put the wrong name again. 'cause um...
Well, if you hadn't meddled to start with, I wouldn't have had to go in there and meddle myself. Now, no matter how much we meddle, we will never be able to un-meddle the thing that you meddled up - in the first place!
You know what? This is not over. We will play you again, and we will win, and you will lose, and you will beg, and we will laugh, and we will take every last dime you have, and you will hate yourselves forever.
Ya know what, I think I'm gonna go to my room and read Cosmo, maybe there's something helpful in there. Know what, at least maybe I can learn how to do an at home bikini wax with leftover Cristmas candles.
My stock, MEG, it went up 2 points. Hey guys, do you realize that if I had invested my $127 in myself yesterday that I'd like have...a lot more than that today. Ya know what, I'm gonna do it.
Yeah, well you call her and tell her that y'know when we were kids her precious little Frannie tried to undress me several times, okay? And if I hadn't have stopped her, there probably wouldn't even be a wedding to go too.
We have too! I mean what if Ross's hears that and then calls her back and then they get back together? Is that what you want? Ross back with that controlling, neurotic, crazy Emily? The Emily that wouldn't let him see you?
Besides tampons and salt? Ooh! My God! Maple candy! That's so sweet of you. That's weird...it's empty! Ross: Hi you guys! what's going on, you... you guys wanna hang out...or...? do you...do you guys hear a buzzing?
So anyway, I'm cooking dinner for him Monday night. You know, kind of like an audition. And Phoebe, he really wants you to be here, which will be great for me because then you can 'ooh' and 'ahh' and make yummy noises.
No, they gave us glasses with lipstick on them! I mean, if they didn't change the glasses, who knows what else they didn't change. Come on sweetie, I just want this weekend to be perfect, I mean we can change rooms, can't we?
Ok people, I want you to take a piece of paper, here you go, and write down your most embarassing memory. Oh, and I do ask that when you're not using the markers, you put the caps back on them because they will dry out.
I can't believe that this whole time we thought he hated us. I mean, isn't it amazing how much you can touch someone's life, without even knowing it?...Would you look at this dump? He hated us. This is his final revenge!
Joey, I think you should consider something a little less risky. I mean, I think in this market, real estate is your best investment.The Fed. just lowered the rates and the interest on your mortgage is totally deductible. That's right, I know some stuff!
Yeah, you were, but you decided to make salmon because you had some left over at the restaurant. And then you realised if you bitched about it, then you would stop cooking, and you would have to make your famous baked potato and Diet Coke.
Don't stare. Now she just finished throwing his clothes off the balcony, now there's just a lot of gesturing and arm-waving, , Ok, that is either, "How could you?" or, "Enormous breasts!" Here he comes!
See, I've been waiting my whole life to be engaged, and unlike some people I'm only planning on doing this once. So, uh y'know, maybe this is selfish and I'm sorry about it, but I was kinda hoping tonight could just be about that.
Yeah-yeah, y'know what? Yeah, that's it-that's it, everything will be mine! Nothing will be yours! That's-that's what I said! Oh come on, Chandler! I'm talking about the barca lounger! It just, it doesn't match! Where is it gonna go?!
No! Really! Any time Ross makes a toast everyone cries, and hugs him, and pats him on the back and they all come up to me and say, "God, your brother." Know what they'll say this year? "God, you"
Yeah, but I love you more. Besides y'know, nothing goes with Bing. So I'm screwed. I mean... Oh, hi Emma. Yeah, that's you. You're our little Em. Oh what's that honey? What? Oh, you want a little cousin? You want a cousin right now?!
A positive atmosphere! But I-I-I have had it up to here. From now on, it is gonna be my way, or the highway! All right? Does anybody have a problem with that?!! Hey new guy! I said, does anybody have a problem with that?!
All right, listen you're just being silly. Rachel, even with that rumor you were one of the most popular girls in school and everyone wanted to be like you. One girl wanted to be like you so much she stuffed her pants with a Tootsie Roll!
Okay, all right, how's this? 27. Italian-American guy. He's an actor, born in Queens. Wow, big family, seven sisters, and he's the only....boy. Oh my God, under personal comments 'New York Knicks, rule!'
'Cause I was going by it the other day and I saw that there was a stock with my initials, MEG, on it and, well, sometimes I have to watch for two or three hours before it comes up again but when it does, it's pretty exciting.
Guys, hurry up! The flight leaves in four hours! It could take time to get a taxi! There could be traffic! The plane could leave early! When we get to London, there could be a line at customs! Come on!!
They've only been going out for a few weeks and Phoebe is completely hung up on Mike! She'll say "No", David's heart will be broken, it will be too hard for them to recover from and then Phoebe will end up alone again.
Oh, isn't he? Oh, you know, I really think this time it may work with him. I mean, he just makes me feel so good and I've been feeling so lousy this last couple of months, no job, no boyfriend. Well, at least my cup is half full.
Yeah, y'know, but something like salmon which would be so much more elegant than the chicken. And, you wouldn't have to worry about the salmonella. But of course with salmon you'd have to worry about the chickenella... So, I can't wait to see this place you're getting married!
You know what I'd love to do? I would like to go to France and eat nothing but bread and cheese-Not even bread, just cheese. No, I want the bread. Yeah. Ah, and pastries... And pate. Oh, I'm really not high, it's just I used to be fat.
No! Listen, I'm not gonna go through this with you again, okay. Just once I wanna beat when you can't blame it on the broken nose, the buzzer, or the fact that you thought you were getting mono. Let's just call this, tie score and it's halftime.
I will prove it to you! Okay? About a week ago I was wearing those jeans and I dropped a pen in my lap and it left an ink stain on the crotch. Now when she comes back I will find it and show you that stain!
Okay! Wait-wait-wait! Shhh! Okay, umm, I just wanna say that...I love you guys so-so much and-and thank you for being here on my special night. Our special night. I mean it just wouldn't be my-our-our night, if you all weren't here to celebrate with me-us-Damnit!
Oh God, stop with the plan! So what, so what you saw him with a girl? Who cares?! That doesn't mean anything! Now look, you're going to go out on a date with Danny and you're going to be so charming he's gonna forget all about that stupid subway girl.
Back then, I thought that I would never, ever get the chance to go out with a Chip Matthews, and now he's-he's called me up and asked me out. And the fat girl inside of me really wants to go. I-I owe her this. I never let her eat.
Y'know, let's face it, I'm not a kid anymore! I-I need to be with someone who-who wants the same things that I do! I mean coming to my place of work and telling me that you love me, I want that! Talking about pig sex over lunch, I don't want that!
Oh how nice. Maybe later we can all go blow our noses on my wedding dress. Ross comes out of the guest bedroom with the diaper bag and the car seat carrying thingy.. yeah.. thats the techinal term.. He goes to Chandler.
Why not?! I mean this has been the most amazing week. Would it be so terrible? Even if we were friends who lived together. Or, maybe someday friends who stood up in front of their other friends, and vowed to be friends forever.
Oh sweetie, you can never embarrass me. Okay, you can easily embarrass me. But come on, it doesn't matter. All right? I married you! So I want to dance on my wedding night with my husband. Come on. Just try not to move your feet at all. There you go.
Okay, all right don't judge me to much. Okay? Um, but I saw this info-mercial, and um, I swear to you I have never-ever bought anything on TV before, except for this mop. But there was this stuff on leg waxing, it just, it looked so amazing....
This place is really my Grandmother's. I got it from her when she moved to Florida, otherwise I could never afford a place like this. So if the landlord ever asks, I'm 87 year old woman, who's afraid of her VCR. So are you thirsty?
It bit. It was a 50's theme restraunt. I have to cook in a costume and dance on the counter. I mean I was a chef at Cafe des Artistes. I mean how could I take a job where I have to make something called Laverne and Curly Fries?
I'm at work, ordinary day, you know, chop chop chop, sauti, sauti, sauti. All of a sudden, Leon, the manager, calls me into his office. It turns out they fired the head lunch chef, and guess who got the job.
Please, could you just try it for me? Come on, I used all my best stuff! I-I-I lit some candles. I put on some music. I used bath salts, plus bubble bath! And got you this little plastic Navy ship. So it's a boy bath!
Your boyfriend has been in there for over an hour. I can't believe it, it's like I'm living with him again. He's here when I go to sleep, he's here when I wake up, he's here when I want to use the shower, ughh. It's like I'm sixteen all over again .
Leon, Leon. Shhh! Guys. Wait, I don't understand. Those steaks were just a gift from the meat vendor. That was not a kick back. I'll just replace them and we can forget the whole thing. What corporate policy? No. Yeah. All right. I just got fired.
Oh. Well, I didn't realize that you needed it back right away. I mean, you told me to go and be a caterer. So I went. I beed. I mean, I... I used it to buy all this stuff. But look-I've got another job tomorrow, so I'll pay you back with the money I make from that.
You're gonna find a place. But even if - God forbid - you didn't.. So you postpone the wedding. Is that really so bad? I mean, think about it. You could take all the time you needed to get everything that you want. You could have tulips, you could have salmon.... Mmmmm... Salmon!!
You used to tell girls you were a Kennedy. Ooh, uh, thanks. Wow, little tight, isn't it? How d'you get a bigger table? You-you had a big table, but they made you move. Huh-huh, shut up Monica. Whoo, I suppose that Chandler will have the smoked duck.
Hey. Oh good-good you're here! All right, I figured it out. I'm gonna take two tables of eight, I'm gonna add your parents, and I'm gonna turn them into three tables of six. Okay? And I called the caterer; I added two extra meals, we are good to go!
It is not over because she is going to call you and tell you she loves you. And the reason why she couldn't, is because her feelings were so strong, it scared her. Now you go home and wait for her call, she could be calling you from the plane! Come on now go! Go!
Excuse me, excuse me, hi, I'm Monica Geller..I'm the head chef here.. .. Ok, I was actually expecting a little applause there, but whatever! Ok, quick question: by a show of hands, how many of you were bothered by this woman's singing outside?
With good news? Of course it is not good news, you just said "Doctor Connelly just called". If it was good news you would have said "Doctor Connelly just called! " But so what is it? Is there a problem, uh? Is there a problem with me or with you?
I'm getting married!!!! I'm gonna be a bride!!!! No, I will not shut up because I'm engaged! Ohh, big talk! Huh, why don't you come over here and say that to me?! Huh, buddy?! Yeah, my fiancee will kick your ass! Come on, apartment 20! Apartment 20!
If it bothers you that much, just go out and get the shoes. No. Don't do this. This is stupid! I don't have to prove anything, I'm gonna go get them...But then everyone will know. Unless I get them, and then wake up really early and put them back! ...I need help!
It's just, I think, there's never gonna be a right time to have a baby. I mean, now you're unemployed and in a little while you'll find a new job that'll keep you really busy. There's always gonna be a reason not to do this, but I think once the baby comes, forget about all those reasons.
Yeah! And if, and if we have a baby one-day, and the doctor hands it to you in the delivery room and you don't cry, so what! And-and-and, and if we take him to college and come home and see his empty room for the first time, and you got nothing, it won't matter to me.
Oh, gosh, this is so weird. I mean, his whole life was in this apartment, and now it's gone. You know, I think it would be nice if we just took a few moments, for Mr. Heckles. I mean, he was kind of a pain, he was, but, he was a person. You're all going to hell.
Now, in some of these recipes, the quantities may seem just a little unusual, uh, like these coconut mockolate holiday nut bars. I've indicated four cups of coconut, and four cups of crushed nut, and only, uh, one tablespoon of mockolate.
Something went wrong with Underdog, and they couldn't get his head to inflate. So anyway, um, his head is like flopping down Broadway, right, and I'm just thinking... how inappropriate this is. Um, I've got something in my eye, uh, Joey, could we check it in the light, please?
Okay, I've broken them down into categories. Okay, we have uh, we got holidays, birthdays, candids, y'know... And then what I've done is I've cross-referenced them by subject. Right? So if you're looking up, oh let's say birthdays and dogs, you get Photo 152. See?
No, a guy would be saying, "I'm never gonna get to sleep with anyone else." Oh my God! I'm never gonna get to sleep with anyone else! I've been so busy planning the wedding that I forgot about all the things that I'd be giving up! I mean, I...I'm never gonna have a first kiss again.
All right, look, Ross. I realize that you have issues with Carol and Susan, and I feel for you, I do. But if you don't help me cook, I'm gonna take a bunch of those little hot dogs, and I'm gonna create a new appetizer called "pigs in Ross". All right, ball the melon.
And-and-and if I die, from a long illness. And you're writing out my eulogy and you open a desk drawer and you find a note from me that says, "I will always be with you," and you still can't shed one tiny tear, I know you'll be crying a river inside.
All right, that's a little sketch of the cake, umm some sample menus, umm y'know what I thought we would start out with Tuscan style finger food, and for music, here's an alphabetized list of all my CDs! I've highlighted the ones that would go really good with the food.
Look, I know that you're in a place right now where you really need to hate Julie's guts, but she didn't do anything wrong. I mean, she was just a girl who met a guy, and now they go out. I really think that if you gave her a chance, you'd like her. Would you just give that a chance, for me?
She's living my life, and she's doing it better than me! Look at this, look. She buys tickets for plays that I wanna see. She, she buys clothes from stores that I'm intimidated by the sales people. She spent three hundred dollars on art supplies.
I mean this has been like my dream since I got my first Easy Bake Oven and opened Easy Monica's Bakery. I mean I would kill for this job. I mean I can totally do this job, and God knows I paid my dues. But Pete's just doing this because he has a crush on me.
Boy, I love carrots! Oh! Sometimes I like to put them between my fingers like this and-and hold them down here while I talk to you. Umm, and-and-and y'know if I get really hot umm, I-I like to pick up this knife and-and umm, I-I put the cold steal against umm, my body.
Michelle, I only beeped in so I could hear my message. I mean that's allowed. Yeah-huh! I mean look, yeah, you know what I would really appreciate it if you didn't tell your Dad about. What do you mean, you're not comfortable with this? Come on we're friends!! That bitch always hated me. I'm calling her back.
Now, Mom, everything's going fine, really. Yeah, Ross is great. He's uh, he's in a whole other place. No, he's gone. No no, you don't have to fly back, really. What do you mean this might be your only chance? Would you stop? I'm only 26, I'm not even thinking about babies yet.
Yeah, I mean yeah, I look great. Yeah, I feel great and yeah, my heart is not in trouble anymore! Blah, blah, blah! Y'know I still don't feel like I got him back, y'know? I just want to humiliate him. I wanna, I want him to be like naked and then I'm going to point at him and laugh!
It's this dumb thing that Ross made up `cause he was trying to fool our parents. It's a way of giving the finger, without actually having to give it. I remember I cried the night you made it up, `cause it was the first time that I realized that I was actually cooler than my older brother.
Y'know what really bothers me? Is-it's how-how different you act around them! I mean y'know the throwing the tennis games, the fake laugh, the "I'll see you around, Bing!" "Not if I see you first, Doug!" I gotta tell you, I don't like Work Chandler. Okay? The guy's a suck-up.
Fair? Please don't even talk to me about fair! Fair would've been you wanting to marry me back then! Or fair would've been Chandler wanting to marry me now! Believe me, nothing about this is fair! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing!
No-no, it's not okay! It's not! I mean you were just... You're so incredible! You went through all this time and effort to make this tape for me! Y'know I'm just gonna-I, I am gonna make this up to you! I will! I-I am going to cook anything you want in here , and I am going to do anything you want in there!
I mean, all I'm asking for is just a little emotion! Is that too much to ask after six years?! I mean what? Are-are-are Rachel and I not as close as you guys?! I mean do we not have as much fun?! Don't I deserve a few tears?!! I mean we-we told Joey, he cried his eyes out!
You are both idiots. The joke is not funny, and it's offensive to women, and doctors, and monkeys! You shouldn't be arguing over who gets credit, you should be arguing over who gets blamed for inflicting this horrible joke upon the world! Now let it go! The joke sucks!
All right, listen up. There is usually only one dress in each size so when they open those doors, fan out. Now, this is what you're looking for! Memorize it! When you locate the dress, blow on these. All right? Three short blasts, when you hear it. Come running.
Ohh, wow! That's great! Oh wow! We really have to start planning! I have, I have a lot of really specific ideas! We should probably get together like four times per week. You can come over to my place; we'll get together before work! What do you say, 6:30, my place? I'm so excited!
All right, all right! Let's just cut to the chase, okay? You're single. You're single. He gets off work at eleven. She'll be waiting for your call. I'll give him your number if I can get one calamari and one Caesar salad!! I did not yell. I am not putting a dollar in the jar.
Oh-ho-ho, sweetie, sweetie, you gotta stop saying that, now. It's no big deal, it's not even worth mentioning, you see we all do it all the time. See watch this, Ben, Ben, Ben. Ow, Monica bang! Everybody bang. Ben bang. Rachel bang. Bang, Rachel bang! Oh, isn't that fun?
Okay! I will! Mrs. Green? Mrs. Green! It is rude to leave a party without saying good-bye to the host! Yeah, and-and also when someone apologizes to you the decent thing to do is to accept it! Now what I did to you, it wasn't on purpose! But what you're during to me now is just plain spiteful!
Well, if you really think about it, I mean four days is not that long. I mean, I see you Monday before you go to work, and I see you Thursday when you get back, and I always work late on Tuesdays, so really if you think about it, it's really just one day. And well, if we can't make it one day, we've got real problems my friend.
Okay, while we're waiting for these pills to kick in, I'm gonna sit you down on the couch. Come on. Get some nice soft pillows under your head, I'm gonna turn the TV on and you can watch whatever you want. And I'm-Sit down--gonna make you some tea. And then, I'm gonna rub your feet.
I swear, I promise. I promise. Oh my God, I'm so excited! {And I just can't hide it! I'm about to lose control and I think I like it! Sorry, just couldn't resist it.} All right, listen let me tell you, do not get her flowers. Okay? Because y'know, she cries when they die, and there's the whole funeral...
See? That's what I mean. I mean that, that's great! But I wouldn't trade in what I have for that. I mean I'm gonna be with Chandler for the rest of my life, and that's what makes me happy. Hey sweetie, come here! Come sit down. Hey Phoebe and I were just talking about how our relationship is deep and meaningful. It really is don't you think?
Ok, here we go. We need to sort out the tickets as quickly as possible to see if we've won. So does anybody have any ideas how to organize this? Ok, how about this: we divide them into 6 groups of 40, and the remaining 10 can be read by whoever finishes their pile first.
Okay, I was thinking we should have a beautiful guest room, right? With a mahogany sleigh bed and bedside tables with flowers on them all the time! And we could have a roll top desk with comment cards on them so people could say how much they loved staying here!! Okay, whatever, I really haven't thought about it that much.
Hey listen umm, how would you like to get together? Say next Saturday? Okay, how about Sunday? Okay umm, the week after that? The week after that? Y'know what Greg? Y'know what? We are good, interesting, funny people with good questions and if you and your precious Jenny can't see that then... January 15th? We'll see you then! Okay!
Chandler, if you thought I was going to get you porn for Valentine's Day... you were right! Apparently, it's about a young girl who moves to the big city, you know, in search of stardom, but ends up having sex with a lot of guys! Yeah, it got four starts! Oh, wait a minute. Those aren't stars. Anyway, you want to take a look?
Ohhh, I knew you loved her! Then you need to go to the airport and tell her. You're probably just gonna catch her just as she's about to go to the gate. You're gonna call out her name and say, "I love you!" And she's gonna say, "I love you, too!" And you guys are going to have the most amazing kiss, everyone at the gate will applaud.
I know. Let's try a look...of far off...wonderment. Okay, we'll-we'll gaze into our future and we'll think about our marriage and the days to come. Chandler! What is the matter with your face?! I mean this picture is supposed to say "Geller and Bing to be married," not "Local woman saves drowning moron!" Hey! Don't laugh at him! He's my drowning moron!
Hi, Nancy. Hi, it's Monica Geller. I'm good. Listen, I'm looking for a job in Tulsa. Well yeah, my husband has been relocated...Because I love him! No, I don't want a job in New York. Javo is looking? Oh my God! He asked for me personally? Oh my God! Oh, wow, this is really flattering, but I'm moving to Tulsa. Yeah, so if you would tell Javo 'I'll take it!'
This switch thing has been driving me crazy. So I turned it off and checked every outlet. Now, four of them don't work. Which means, one of them has to be controlled by the switch. So, I plugged in things in all four of the outlets that-that make noise, so that way, when I turn it on I just follow the noise and find out which one it is.
How hard is it? No shoes on the furniture. Back to Monica and Chandler's apartment. Amy is sitting on a chair by the bay window looking mad. Joey groans and gets off the phone: The producer from Days left a message on my machine asking why I wasn't at the parade. They said everybody's pissed off at me.. And they all got to meet Santa!
No, look, she's obviously unstable, okay? I mean she's thinking about running out on her wedding day. Okay, fine! But I mean, look at the position she's putting him in! What's he gonna do? Ross is gonna run over there on the wedding day and break up the marriage?! I mean, who would do that?! Okay, fine, all right, but that's y'know, it's different! Although it did involve a lot of the same people.
It's gonna be really scary. I mean, god. When we have a baby, there's gonna be so much that we're not able to control. I mean, the apartment's gonna be a mess, I won't have time to clean it. What if the baby gets into the ribbon drawer? Messes up all the ribbons?! What if there's no room for a ribbon drawer, because the baby's stuff takes up all the space!? Where will all the ribbons go!?!
Hi, uh, Richard it's Monica, um, listen I did something kind of crazy tonight, um, maybe I'm getting my period or something, I don't know. Um, anyway, I, I, I beeped into your machine and I heard a message that, that freaked me out, and um, you know what Michelle will tell you the rest. I, I, um, I'm sorry, okay, I, I hope that we can forget the whole thing. Okay, bye.
No. He Teaches A Course On Food Criticism At The New School, So Before We Go To The Movies I Wanna Go By There And Make Him Try My Bouillabaisse Again. Oh, I Cannot Wait To Read The Front Page Of The Post Tomorrow! "Restaurant Reviewer Admits I was wrong about Monica."
It is so weird, I know what I said, but uh, this morning, I was lying in bed I was, I was imagining what it would be like to say yes. I know it's a little sudden, and it's a little rushed, and it's totally not like me to do something like this, but that doesn't mean I can't. Right? I mean I'm-I'm crazy about Pete, and I know that we want the same things, and when I thought about saying yes, it made me really happy.
I really like to say that I'm-um... Y'know what I'd really like to say? I'm drunk!! That's right mom and dad your little Harmonica is hammered!! And guess what! I've been drunk before! And I've smoked a cigarette! And I got a box of Ding-Dongs hidden in my underwear drawer! It's all okay. It's okay because I turned thirty today. And, and I can do anything I want! Because I am a grown up.
Hello? Yeah, hi! Mrs. Tribbiani? Hi, this is Monica Geller. Yeah I'm just calling to say that Chandler and I uh, really hope you can make it to the wedding. Yeah, apparently a bunch of invitations that we sent weren't delivered. Umm, I guess there was some screw up at the damn post office! T-Tell me about it! Yeah, yeah, the US Post Office? No, more like US lost office! What are they Irish?!
Chandler, for so long I...I wondered if I would ever find my prince, my soul mate. Then three years ago, at another wedding I turned to a friend for comfort. And in stead, I found everything that I'd ever been looking for my whole life. And now...here we are...with our future before us...and I only want to spend it with you, my prince, my soul mate, my friend. Unless you don't want to. You go!
Absolutely! Now get out of here you!! Okay, I'm running out of places I can touch him! Look, is there something wrong with me? I mean why am I only attracted to guys where there's no future? Either they're too old, or they're too young, and then there's Pete who's-who's crazy about me, and who's absolutely perfect for me, and there's like zip going on! I mean, seriously, does it sound like something's wrong with me?!
Emily has probably been planning it since she was five! Ever since the first time she took a pillowcase and hung it off the back of her head. That's what we did! We dreamed about the perfect wedding, and the perfect place, with the perfect four-tiered wedding cake , with the little people on top. Thanks. But the most important part is that we had the perfect guy who understood just how important all that other stuff was.
Why? Because everything is my responsibility? Isn't it enough that I'm making Thanksgiving dinner for everyone? You know, everyone wants a different kind of potatoes, so I'm making different kinds of potatoes. Does anybody care what kind of potatoes I want? Nooooo, no, no! Just as long as Phoebe gets her peas and onions, and Mario gets his tots, and it's my first Thanksgiving, and it's all burned, and, and I... I...
Y'know, so I don't read as many important books as you do, and I don't write trick poems that seem to be about one thing but are actually about something else. And y'know what, I get excited about stupid stuff, like when I my People magazine comes on Saturday, and the new Hold Everything catalog. Y'know but that does not mean that I'm empty, I care about things. I care about my friends and family. You have no right to make that kind of judgment about me.
Phoebe, that's how it starts. I don't need to eat the cake, I'll just smell the icing... why don't I just eat a little sliver, or, okay, just a slice or two. And next thing you know, you're 210 pounds and you get wedged in going down the tunnel slide. Phoebe, honey, I know this is hard. Look, if you talk to him, you're going to wanna see him. And if you see him, you're going to want to get back together with him. I know that's not what you want. Give me your phone.
No, no it's going to be great. Really! Mom, Dad, when I got married, one of the things that made me sure I could do it was the amazing example the two of you set for me. For that and so many other things I want to say thank you. I know I probably don't say it enough, but I love you. When I look around this room, I'm-I'm saddened by the thought of those who could not be here with us. Nana, my beloved grandmother who would so want to be here, but she can't because she's dead. As is our dog Chi-Chi. I mean look how cute she is. . Was. Do me a favor and pass this to my parents. Remember she's dead. Okay, her and Nana, gone. Wow! Hey does anybody remember when Debra Winger had to say goodbye to her children in Terms of Endearment? Didn't see that? No movie fans?! You want to hear something sad? The other day I was watching 60 Minutes these orphans in Romania, who have been so neglected, they were incapable of love. You people are made of stone! Here's to mom and dad! Whatever!
