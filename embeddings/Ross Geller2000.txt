Somewhere maybe along the equator?
Pheebs, if you don't tell him, soon he's gonna be married, and then you're gonna hate yourself.
Mitzi is.....
Oh my God, you've got a crush on your sister's stalker.
30 seconds on the clock. 5 questions wins the game. The lightning round begins...now! What is Joey's favorite food?
Ok, no, no, you hang up. You, you, y...
Well, oh just ah, I was just wondering, when you and I split up, did you get the tape that was half the last episode of M*A*S*H and half the hostages coming home?
He's right, even if it's to say something complementary.
Uh, I like to, uh, to add something to that...
You have to tell her! You have to tell her! It's your moral obligation, as a friend, as a woman, I think it's a feminist issue! Guys? Guys?
Oh yeah, I'd love that.
You did! Oh.... I always figured you just thought I was Monica's geeky older brother.
She's not here yet. She's not here. She's having my baby and she's not here.
Ironically, most of the boxes seem to be labeled clothes.
Hey.
Umm, okay, yeah, sure. But wh-what's wrong with Monica and Chandler?
See there, you uhh, alright, ya, you did what I said.
I love you.
Hey!
You tell them to wait!
So tell me something. What does the phrase 'no date pact' mean to you?
I'm sorry, man. Hey, y'know what you should do? You should make something happen for yourself. Y'know, like-like write a play. Write a movie! Huh? I mean, what about those Good Will Hunting guys?
What?
Yeah, it is.
2:17.
Don't you realise none of this would've ever happened if I didn't think at that same moment you weren't having sex with Mark?
No, I'm good.
What, uh... what were you thinking?
I'll do it. Hey, whatever you need me to do, I'm your man. Whoa-oh-whoa! Are you, are you okay?
Yeah, what, what was I thinking?
A little. Yeah. I made a snack.
Oh God. Y'know, botanists are such geeks.
Oh, yeah.
Why, why, why would you dream that?
Well, I-I gotta go break up with Bonnie.
Are you not seeing him anymore?
Look, I... Look, I'm having a great time with you and I just don't want us to move to fast or put to much pressure on us. So, I'm sorry I just don't think we should go away together yet. It's-it's too soon.
Okay, remember, we were young. Hey, Spring break, sophomore year, I got high in my bedroom and my parents walked in and smelled it and so I told them that you had gotten stoned and jumped out the window.
To wear in front of people?
We'll be starting with apples.
I want my turkey now!
It's the-Chandler!!
Yeah, we'll just use our special cake tools.
Who's drink can I freshen?
I am!
Yeah. And did you, did you pack that bathing suit?
All right.
Come here. Listen, you deserve so much better than him...you know, I mean, you, you, you should be with a guy who knows what he has when he has you.
No no no, go-
Ok, ok, now what is wrong with my Snuggles? What, it says I'm a sensitive, warm kinda guy, you know, like a warm, fuzzy bear. Ok, I can pick something else up on the way.
I can't believe it. Can I tell you something? I'm a little mad at him now.
And where she's going everyone else'll be dressier?
Nothing! There's nothing to do! I mean, she lives there, I live here. I mean, she-she'd have to uh, move here. She should move here!
I fell asleep!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, ho, ho, ho, you did not win the game, the touchdown didn't count, because of the spectacularly illegal, oh and by the way savage nose breaking.
Hmph.
All right. All right, I'm gonna do it!
Hi, we have a little bathroom emergency.
Dude, what are you doing?
Rachel...
Getting married. Okay. Okay. You can, you can do that too! Just like you've done everything else!
Oh, who cares?
Not just restaurants, from our house.
Hi.
That is correct.
I didn't know what I was taking full responsibility for! Okay?! I didn't finish the whole letter!
All right. Y'know what? We don't have to go downstairs! We can bring Vegas up to us! All right, come on, come on, we'll play some blackjack. Here we go. 13.
Oh I a lot of stuff!
Phoebe!
I know.
Oh God.
So, uh, does it do anything, you know, special?
What?
Go? Why?
Hey!
You ever figure out what that thing's for?
No-no, this is my collection of fossil samples.
So, we're off.
We're all alone in an empty apartment.
How we doing, you guys ready?
Yes, yes of course, what-what would this be regarding?
Hey, this- Heyy...
Well, howdya feel?
Not so good.
Men. I guy I know.
Yes, but also Hanukkah! See, you're part Jewish, and-and Hanukkah is a Jewish holiday.
Hey-hey have you ever locked yourself in a TV cabinet VD boy?!
Hey, would you ah, would you like some juice?
...and these come in the shapes of your favourite Christmas characters, Santa, Rudolph, and Baby Jesus.
Thank you, but I want to remove it Pheebs. I don't want to make it savory.
Dad, we-we can't believe you're selling the house.
I just wanna clarify this: are you outing Mr. Peanut?
What? What?
Look, don't blame us. You guys coulda been there, you know.
It's heads. Gentlemen, pick your category.
Hi Janine!
Yes.
I...Reorganized The Fridge. See, Bottom Shelf: Meats And Dairy. And Top Shelf expired products.
Really. It's always been you, Rach.
Breathe! Breathe! Breathe throw the pain.
So, what are you guys doing four weeks from today?
Oh, I-I don't know, it's kind of expensive for a studio.
So, you gals wanna hand over your money now? That way, we don't have to go through the formality of actually playing.
Five letters.
Got me.
Ok, just, just remember how crazy I am about you, ok?
Hey, Paulo. What are you doing here?
Uh actually, I sent the flowers before the actual date. So techincally, technically I didn't break any rules. Thanks for stopping by though.
Look, just because some idiot drew on your face doesn't mean you shouldn't have any fun! Okay? And besides, hey-hey-hey no one is even gonna look at you. Okay? This is Vegas! Hello! There are tons of other freaks here! There are tons...of...freaks here. No other. No. Come on! No one will notice, I swear!
Really?
I always knew I was havin a baby, I just never realised the baby was having me.
Uh-huh.
He finally asked you out?
Good morning. Nice breasts by the way.
Yeah, but, but look what I'm...
Bye Ben.
We're good.
Dear Lord!!
Ohhh. Big boy, riding the bus--Hey, I have a question. How come it says Property of Human Services on his butt?
OK, fine, well I'm not gonna watch, alright.
You know what I like most about him, though?
Joey?!
Okay, okay, I'm sorry, it will never happen... Uh-oh! Wait a minute! Wait-wait, now there are a hundred of you and I'm the king.
Hey!
Rachel one brunch is not gonna solve anything. You gotta face it, okay we're never gonna get along.
Look, I am totally, totally over her, OK, I just... : Hiiii!
Won't you dance around with me.
I, er...
Okay, hey, that's okay with me. Two down and I have exactly twelve minutes.... Wha, my watch stopped. My watch. Okay, see, the, the dinosaur tail isn't going around any more. What time is it? It's 7:33, I have seven minutes. I have seven minutes!!
Yes!
Good! A verbal contract is binding in the state of New York!
Hey, anyone hear from Phoebe yet?
Ahh, whoo-hoo!!
No! No! I...didn't do that. It's just... Okay, honestly no. I don't, I don't see a big future with her.
You were worried about me? You didn't know how I was going to react?
It's no surprise that your winning, 'cause you got to pick first, so you got the better team.
Oh, now you want a favour?
Oh my God, the wedding book?! I haven't seen that since the forth grade!
Oh, hey y'know, they-they really overcharge you for that stuff. But who cares?! Because it's all on me! That is, one big drink!
A wandering?
I mean my God...
Hey guys!
My marriage, I think my marriage is um, is kinda over.
Hi, is Rachel there?
Yeah!
I guess he musta gotten the part in that play.
Most of you don't know me, I'm Rachel's boyfriend.
All right here. Watch me execute the three 'P's of championship play. Power. Precision. and penache.
What? No! Of course, of course I do! Are-are they gone?
You are such a tattletale! Mom, Dad, you remember that-that time you walked in my room and smelled marijuana?
Oh, hey, hey, I got that.
All right, see you guys.
All right, did you just say all right?
Yeah, well it came to about $112, but what the hell, just call it an even 110?
What?
No! No! No!
You mean, we-you and me?
Seriously, I-I asked you before and you still haven't gotten it.
Okay here we are Paul, Elizabeth. So I hope you guys were finding something to talk about.
Hey.
Hey!
I'm here.
What, now you're not even taking to me? Look Rachel, I-I'm sorry, okay, I'm sorry, I was out of my mind. I thought I'd lost you, I didn't know what to do. Come on! Come on, how insane must I have been to do something like this? Huh? I-I don't cheat right, I, that's not me, I'm not Joey!
All right I've been feeling incredibly guilty about this, because I wanna be a good friend, and dammit I am a good friend. So just, just shut up and close your eyes .
No.
No, no, no just do it. Go in there and pick something out so we can go.
Thanks? But I have plans; Elizabeth and I are going out of town.
Ahh. Ooh, is this a ah, is this a bad time?
No! Why?
Ohhhh...
You weren't trying to entice me with your nakedness.
That's, that's Julie. Ju... Julie, Julie. Hi Julie.
Okay.
Phoebe! I can't believe you gave them money! I thought you agreed it was totally unreasonable that they asked me for that money!
Hi.
I don't know, God, I... well, it's not like she's a regular mom, y'know? She's, she's sexy, she's...
Neil Sedaka wears them.
And what are you going to do for him?
Oh, uh, can it wait a second Joey? I have to tell my parents something. No it can't? Okay.
Nuh-uh.
Hey.
It was ridiculous. Ya know, these guys, they were bullies, actual bullies, ya know. We're grown ups, this kinda stuff isn't supposed to happen anymore.
'Scuse us
Uh, hello, it's third down.
Yeah, c'mon I mean I though, you know, I thought we're just foolin' around. Like when, uh, when we were kids.
Right.
For your information, it's a card sharp, not a card shark.
The physical act of love.
Yeah, it really was!
Hi!
Okay! Okay! But if she doesn't call, it is definitely over! No, wait. Wait. Unless, eventually, I call her, y'know just to she what's going on, and, and she says she'll call me back, but then she doesn't. Then it's over.
...So I think Alan will become the yardstick against which all future boyfriends will be measured.
I can.
I, Ross...
I didn't order lemonade.
So, uh, how's she doing?
Well, there you go.
What?
Ok, would people stop drinking the breast milk?
Yeah-No!!
Hey!
No.
That's all right, we-we don't need you. In fact, hey I'm over it already.
Not nice enough.
Well, he had gravity boots.
Well, Ben would be there.
Really?
The uh, the baby that hasn't been born yet? Wouldn't that mean you're... crazy?
I think It's the most beautiful table I've ever seen.
Who would you rather be Simon or Garfunkle?
Green. To the green.
No I don't, to hell with her, she left me!
What are you, what are you doing?
D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help?
Wow, well uh, uh, actually, Julie's downstairs getting a cab, I just need the cat toy, did Monica say. . . What? Why, why are you looking at me like that?
Althea is correct.
Yeah.
What?! What?!
Good morning. Hey pal, look who I brought. It's your old friend Harry Elefante.
It-it-The point is my natural charisma has made him fail his midterm.
Hmm? Oh, yeah.
Oh, I believe I had the half-drunk cappuccino with the lipstick on the rim.
Okay. So well I'll umm, I'll have her home by midnight.
No, four minutes ago you had a half hour, we have to be out the door at twenty to eight.
That's right, he's not Drake, he's Hans Remore, Drake's evil twin.
Hey, how are you holding up?
Well maybe it's cold in there. Or maybe I screwed up the first date I had in 9 years.
He told you everything! I mean you totally cracked him!
I'm sorry. It's just that this is the worse Thanksgiving ever.
My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I'm not, I can't do-
No, no, we will. We just won't tell her she messed up.
Hey, do you have any gum?
Hi!
Atta boy.
Because it's a special hat. See he bought it 'cause he was feeling really down one day so he got the hat to cheer himself up, ya know. Now Chandler...
And, uh, and then I kissed her.
Yeah.
He-he was with me umm, we're playing a little game, y'know? Hide and seek.
I suppose.
Yes, I do have a laundry room in my building, um, but there's a.... rat problem. Apparently they're attracted to the dryer sheets, and they're goin' in fine, but they're comin' out all.... fluffy. Anyway, say, sevenish?
Well, when you're subletting an apartment from your wife's cousin and then you get a divorce, sometimes the cousin suddenly wants his apartment back.
She's not even here yet.
Ah, what good are you.
Yeah, but this can't be it, I mean.
I was really upset about Rachel and Paolo, and I think I had too much tequila, and Nora- um, Mrs. Mom- your Bing- was just being nice, y'know, and- But nothing happened, nothing- Ask Joey, Joey, uh, came in-
Yeah. What-what should I do?
I see your twenty, raise you twenty-five.
Aqui est.
Are you angry at me because I said your handwriting is childlike?
What's the matter? You okay?
Yeah?
I knew you were gonna throw that in my face!! That was three years ago! She apologized and she apologized! What more do you want?!!
Well, actually it's been great. She's 20 so she's not looking for anything too serious, which is perfect for me right now.
Well umm...
Does it? Does it? Yeah, I wanted to give that whole 'Does it?' part just another glance.
Wha-I'm having, I'm having a boy! Huh, am I having a boy?
Monica, come on now. Let's go, baby coming.
It's not a club.
No, but it's-it's-it's hot!
That's okay, I'm cool over here. I'll catch up with you later, Joey.
I made a man twice my size cry. I mean, I haven't done that since I was four and I washed my dad's Porsche with rocks.
Yeah, well, m-maybe you're right.
Um. I know it says black tie optional, but, um this may be pushing it a little, um.
I don't know.
What, are we keeping Thanksgiving a secret this year?
Y'know what? He didn't want to talk to us about being angry, well maybe we don't talk to him at all!
Yeah, well what about you? You weren't you know, so hot in college either. After everything he said, he'd go "ba dum bum chessh"
I-I-I don't even know why I bother to talk to you guys about it. Y'know what? I'm just gonna do it on my own with no naked chicks.
What the hell are doing?!!
OK. Hold my board.
Okay.
You take your time.
Oh, she isn't home.
Press the button.
Look, don't worry about me. Okay? I'll just stay real energetic and stay away from the ball. I'll uh, I'll be that guy right out of the circle.
Hmm?
Good! That's good!
That-that's always good news. Are you okay?
Look sweetie, I could be the bigger man, I could be the biggest man, I could be a big, huge, giant man, and it still wouldn't make any difference, except that I could pick your Father up and say 'Like me! Like me tiny doctor!'
Okay the sleeping thing. Very tricky business, but there is something you can do.
It really was.
That sounds great. Same for me.
Nope.
No thank you for... Thank you.
I'm getting married, to..day!!
I know.
We got a head, we got shoulders, we got arms, we got, oh, look at the little fingers, oh, and a chest, and a stomach. It's a boy, definitely a boy! All right! Ok, legs, knees, and feet. Oh, oh. He's here. He's a person.
They published my paper.
Well, I said it loud.
Fine! Thank you for warning me. At breakfast I'll be on full alert for room painting and sex weapons.
Gimme the bottle. Gimme the towel.
Well, I-I was watching her the other day at the pizza place.
Humm, that sounds, I don't, perfect.
Rach, thanks but uh, I don't need you doing me any favors.
No!!
I'm just trying to help you, move on.
Wow.
You're great. And I-I know someday this will happen for you too. You just hang in there.
Oh hey, hey, huh, how about this weekend we have a laser disc marathon okay, and maybe a tournament on my new dart board? Huh, huh, what do you think? Two days of darts, it'll be great!
Oh my-Come here! Come here! It's okay. Everything's gonna be okay.
Oh I'm, I'm making this too hard. Okay, what do you want me to do.
That would be no.
Oh, no, no.
Fine.
Oh hey, don't thank me, thank yourself. You're the one who faced her fears and ultimately overcame them.
Okay.
Well then that's it. And if George and Adelaide can't accept that, then the hell with them. Look, if my parents didn't want me to marry you, no way that would have stopped me. Look, this is your wedding. Do it.
All right. I think it was a mouse.
You see what men do! Don't tell me men are not nice! This is men!!
Uhh, not much. You guys want to see a movie tonight?
I don't know Rachel, why?
Oh, that's right! He called to ask out Monica! That-that's gotta be embarrassing!
Yeah.
Ugh. It's definitely getting worse.
Let me see! Show them!
What about the time I said we were on a break?
Oh, oh. Oh, oh. Oh this is it. Oh my god it's baby time. Baby time.
The point is I... I don't need this right now, OK. It, it's too late, I'm with somebody else, I'm happy. This ship has sailed.
Yeah!!!
Why-why can't you take a couple of days off?
Hey, if they have a ball maybe you can stick razor blades in it and teach them a new game, Gonna Need Stitches Ball.
Fine.
Nevermind.
Y'know what, y'know what, I'm-I'm not the one that wanted that, that break, okay. You're the one that bailed on us. You're the one that, that ran when things got just a little rough!
One more time, "Hey, don't you want a washboard stomach and rock hard pecs?"
I'm supposed to attach a brackety thing to the side things, using a bunch of these little worm guys. I have no brackety thing, I see no whim guys whatsoever and- I cannot feel my legs.
Uh.. uh.. Well, Joey and I had discussed getting in an early morning racquetball game. But, um, apparently, somebody overslept.
No.
Chloe? Hi..
I can't believe you hated me.
You see this, this is a person who is ready to go. Phoebe you, oh, you are my star.
Sure. I'll help you.
I go back there with lawn ornaments, he's going to laugh in my face.
You're gonna be a party person! Those guys rock the most!
Hello, baby. Hello, hello.
That was just the pants on the couch. Umm, hey, do you, do you mind if I use your bathroom?
It's not a library...
Thanks. I-I think I'm dying. I really do.
I just wanted to thank you again for last night, what a great party! And the guys from work had a blast. Y'know, one of them had never been to a bachelor party before. Yeah! And-and another one had never been to a party before, so...
Is uh, is Monica here?
Hi.
Eh, either way I'll pass. I still can't eat those. What's so funny?!
Okay, okay, okay. I'll get the bagels.
Hey Chandler! Saw the new furniture. Very nice.
Hey, what's goin' on?
Cassie?!
You deserve to be with someone who appreciates you, and who gets how funny and sweet and amazing, and adorable, and sexy you are, you know? Someone who wakes up every morning thinking "Oh my god, I'm with Rachel". You know, someone who makes you feel good, the way I am with Julie. Was there a second of all?
Okay, I gotta go.
Okay umm, bad stuff. Well, I'm-I'm 12 years older than she is.
So what, we just sit?
Well, umm, why don't you give him a call?
No, that's, no, as long as you're okay. So I'll ah, I'll see you tomorrow.
I know, why not?
Umm, no.
Hi! What are you, what are you doing here?
Oh. How do you uh, ya know, keep it so neat?
You wanna wander in the hall? Ooh, hey Ben, what if the Holiday Armadillo told you all about the festival of lights?
Anyway. That's when our Mom said we were not to play football ever again.
Do you perhaps seeing a note on top of it?
Oh, thanks, thanks. So Monica tells me that uh, you don't want to play anymore because me and y'know my talent. Is that true?
Okay, hold my crawler.
Okay, let's go!
Nope! Something else.
Is that Mark?
No, it's okay. Some-some kid asked me to pick it up for him, but I don't...
Okay, umm...
Dude, we were good!
Thank you for bringing her into our lives.
You should've seen the look on her face. I don't want Rachel to hate me! I don't know what to do.
You're not going to go.
Uh-huh, I see that.
Yeah, he's head of the department.
Oh no! It could be better, but it's gonna be okay, right?
I know where Joey would be. He would be down in the foxhole protecting all of us.
Okay, okay, so we're in the car. Right? And bang! A shot was fired. And Joey with no regard for his own safety throws himself on me!
We're here!
Whatever dude, you kissed a guy.
Uhh, hey look, I don't really enjoy being with other men that way. But, um, zoo dollars?
Hey, Pheebs!
Okay.
Uh, yeah! I still can't believe she hates Pottery Barn!
I had a problem.
You don't have to shout everything.
What? What?
Now, how will they know if you're ready?
Your mother's right. Take her, you can wear my tux.
Are you intrigued?
Mon?
I'm sorry you lost your money, but I won it fair and square.
Oh, what are you going to do, follow me down there?
Phoebe? Phoebe?
Okay, good-good for you.
I hear ya.
Naa. A while ago I got a sah out of him, which I thought, ya know, might turn into sah-condary caregiver but... Hey, would you uh, would you hold him for a sec, 'cause I, I gotta take this off.
Well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title?
Look, I-I drew a sketch about how we're gonna do it. Okay Rach, that's you. That's the couch.
And she's just so sexy and funny and has the cutest little...
Am I?! And was it your idea to postpone the wedding?!
She does want to.
No, I can't. I would, I really would, but my son is here; I can't leave him. Isn't-you don't think there's any way?
Oh, right!
Yeah?
Oh, that. Umm, she took it really well.
Ahh, sorry, nothing you can do about it. It's one of my ah, rights as the ex-boyfriend. Oop, oh yeah!
Monica, I'm cutting you off.
Uh, lunch chef, purchasing, own little desk when Roland's not there. Here's to my little sister--
I think you would have to clean a whole lot of apartments to go all the way to India.
It doesnt matter. You dont dip your pen in the company ink.
Look, would you guys grow up? That is the most natural beautiful thing in the world.
Wow! I didn't know that there was a Pottery Barn up here.
Yeah! Yeah, Emily always wanted to get married in this beautiful place that her parents got married, but it's going to be torn down, so... I mean, I-I know it's crazy, but everything up 'til now has been so crazy, and I don't know, this just feels right. Y'know?
Thanks. You ready to go?
Are you sure?
No you do-y'know what, you're not gonna suck me into this.
Well, I called over there and it turns out Ugly Naked Guy is subletting it himself and he's already had like a hundred applicants.
Hey! How'd the ah, basketball go?
No, you've heard my practice. Okay? Just-just give me a chance to perform for you and then decide whatever you want. And I'm not going to tell you what song I'm gonna play either. But uh, let's just say when it's over I'll bet there will be a we bit o' celebration.
All right, here's the ring.
Yeah?
??? Thro up a thro thro--a thro thro!
Listen, I know you wanted to talk to me, but I have an idea that may make you want to stay married. We register, and you get to keep all the presents!
And if you wait right here, I'll go get Ross.
I have to go. Yeah, Carol should be home by now, soo...
Hey
Hi.
No! No! It's wrong! It's-it's-it's naughty. It's taboo.
Because you're a kook! Instead you wait until they send you a notice.
Let-let me make sure I'm hearing this right, you're ending this with me because I'm too whiney? So you're saying, I've become so whiney that I annoy you, Janice.
Do you know the word crapweasel?
I-I-I don't care if I said some other girl's name you prissy, old twit!
Well I told you it was Chandler who was smoking the pot but it was me. I'm sorry.
Well... you never know. How's, um.. how's the family?
Oh thanks!
What did you get?
I played bad on purpose guys.
That doesn't matter. She wanted to call Bob. Hey, for all we know, Bob is who she was meant to be with. You may be destroying two people's chance for happiness.
I uh, I just got back from uh, from Julie's.
'Kay, first of all, this attitude is not helping.
Dad...dad, please! As I was saying umm, I'm Dr. Ross Geller. Uhh, and I'm the best man. And uh, this marriage is doubly special for me umm, because not only is the groom my best friend but uh, the bride is my little sister. And, she's the greatest sister a guy could ask for. So if you'd all please join me in raising a glass to the, the couple we're here to celebrate. To the Bings.
She is not... She's gay. Oh my God. She is so gay! I can't believe this.
No. Look, I told you I am not a part of this thing.
Really?! So what would you say Pheebs? Stuff like uh, "Keep your mitts off my grub?"
You-you-you-you threw my sandwich away!
Hey, you guys! What do you, what do you think about making that beach trip an annual thing?
Yeah.
Yeah sure.
Hey-hey Pheebs!
Of course I am! Okay, let's go godfather.
Wow, Monica's letting other people help decorate her tree! Did someone get her drunk again or?
Okay!
Ah, I'm sorry.
College?
What's her last name?
I picked up the divorce papers. Uh, I've already signed everything and I put little 'X's where you need to sign.
All right, I see what you guys are saying. I'll uh, I'll go downstairs and fill out an application.
No.
We, we just decided to uh, to go for it.
Hey hey, we'll be fine. We're just gonna need a little time.
Yeah, which was nice.
Okay.
Is this about Mark?
You're right. That's very different. So let's, let's just sign the papers. All right? What?
Aww.
Yep.
Sorry, I'm sorry. Close, close, close...
Rach, do you uh, are you gonna separate those?
Oh, she didn't think it would be that big of deal.
Susan Sarandon.
Huh.
Wha, OK, I'm sorry, let's uh, why don't we find someplace else.
Apparently, he told Johnny Shapiro that she's quite a girl. In fact, he told Johnny that he thinks he's falling in love with her.
Eat your fish.
Hmm.
You were trying to eat it!
Doorknob! Doorknob!
Yeah! We'd meet, we'd meet total strangers, and hang out with them!
Well, pretty incredible according to the message she left you on my machine. Hey, Chandler, why is this woman leaving a message for you on my machine?
Y'know, I-I-you've done a lot of stupid stuff too! Okay?
I was thinking more like a hundred.
So, Dr. Green, how's the old boat.
Monica knows.
Oh what's the big deal?! I wasn't even invited to the ceremony, just the reception. And-and y'know what? If it makes you feel any better, Joan and I will just make an appearance and then, and then we'll-we'll leave early as a sign of protest.
What do you mean?
Hey, uh, you can ignore that.
Second date!
Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow.
It would really help when I'm kissing you if you didn't shout out my sister's name.
Will you hold Ben for a sec? Come here. Come here.
Hhhiiii.
Dude!
Uh, Rach, do you want me to shuffle those?
I'll be fine, alright? Really, everyone. I hope she'll be very happy.
What, what's that?
Hey, so uh, y'know how there's something I wanted to talk to you about?
Get the what?
But, okay.
Uh, Phoebe...
You have to respect the sea!
Phoebe.
Oh Mon, I laughed so hard...
Thanks for the help, problem solved.
And I too am just a love machine.
All right, maybe it means that too...
I'm reading your ad.
What?!
Oh, you uh, you wanna hear a freaky coincidence? Guess who's doing laundry there too?
Ohh, man! Chicago, is sooo lucky!
Please. This is so your fault.
We're just tryin' to do a nice thing here.
...And I read about these women trying to have it all, and I thank God 'Our Little Harmonica' doesn't seem to have that problem.
Hello? Hey Mon, how's the packing going? Ben? He's fine. Yeah, he's right-Oh my God! Get your head of your shirt there son! What? Yeah, it's a pumpkin. I'll come pack.
So uh, any ideas for the bachelor party yet?
Alright boys, let's eat.
Buy mommy.
Done!
No. No, no. She doesn't want to see you right now.
I'm-I'm gonna wear this all the time! I love this shirt!!
Everybody!
Twice.
No, I, I only know Lipson.
And, I love you!!
So suck it up man, it's a job, it's money.
Okay. Honey?
Ugh, museum.
Maybe this would've happened if I'd been more nurturing, or I'd paid more attention, or I... had a uterus. I can't believe this!
Guess what?
Ow! Ow! Okay, okay, fine, fine! All right, you wanna win by cheating, go ahead, all right. Phoebe the touchdown does count, you win.
That's true, thanks dad. People should be dancing! Huh? Hey, this is a party! Come on! Joey, dance!!
Look, don't worry. Okay? You're gonna be fine.
And this girl is making eyes at Chandler, okay? So after awhile he-he goes over to her and uh, after a minute or two, I see them kissing. Now, I know what you're thinking, Chandler's not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out with girls, and you're right, Chandler's not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out with...girls.
Awww, man! Really?
Yes! You're the person who checked out my book?!
Monica had such a crush on him. Yeah, she used to kiss his poster every night before she went to bed.
Well, not really. I mean technically it's-it's not against the rules or anything, but it is frowned upon. Especially by that professor we ran into last night, Judgey von Holierthanthou.
I'm the Holiday Armadillo, your part-Jewish friend. You sent me here to give Ben some presents. Remember?
With the belly-button ring? Oh, muhawa!
You're over me?
Well, I'm gonna kiss you.
Oh. Oh-oh.
Do you have a point?
I thought, uh... it was a fifty cent limit.
Well maybe, you know, maybe we should stay for one song.
Oh-ho, okay.
Well, I do! Why don't we go back to my place, light a couple of candles, break open a box of Cinnamon Fruit Toasties, uh...
Sweetie, it's be gonna okay, all right. It's a wedding, generally people focus on the bride.
Hey!
Yeah.
It's ok. I'm sorry.
No, of course not! ...Yeah, yeah, it is.
Oh.
Why?!
Well then we'll-we'll see you the day after tomorrow. Mom?! Dad?! What-what...what you guys doing here?!
It just amazes me that your still pulling stuff like this.
Oh, okay. What-what about?
Oh great! That means I'm stuck with, "So, we were watching you in there and you were sittin' right here! Whoa!"
What?
No?
All right, fine! Fine! Have me fired! But uh, I want you to know that you and I are not all that different. I mean, I too am a neat guy.
Emily, hi! Uh, how-how was you flight?
What's with her?
Aw, how can you say that? I cant even get Marcel to stop eating the bath mat. How am I gonna raise a kid?
Oh no. Don't, don't, don't start packing. Come on!
...Chandler!
She's doing her laundry.
Nothing, ah there was this thing at the museum. Come on. Easy.
You're drunk! Mom and dad are gonna be maaaaadd! Maybe I'm a little drunk.
You mean hardball?
Okay, there are no stupid fights!! This isn't about the room, this is about what the room...represents! And unfortunately, this room could destroy you!!
Yeah, me too.
What?
Look...
...run it all over your body until you're... trembling with... with...
Thanks for letting me tag along tonight you guys.
Yeah! Oh, I-I love this babies!
Um-hmm! Doesn't that sound delicious at the last minute?
Hey.
Yeah, not as much as you used to love to play uncooked batter eater.
You kissed her.
Oh yeah? I guess we'll just see!
I was up all night writing this really nasty letter to Emily! It was perfect and now it's all covered in-in... Actually, thanks!
So I guess you bought that book after we broke up huh?
Oh-oh, hitting me where it hurts, my ski skills.
Come on out, honey! I'm telling you look good! Tell her she looks good, tell her she looks good.
What do you like better flora or fauna?
All right. A room. A man enters, he looks suspicious. That's it? Joey, you're supposed to have five pages done by now! Including an exciting incident! And what is, and what is all this?! The official rulebook of Fireball.
Thank you.
Well, so, you-you'll get a job here! I mean, I'm always hearing about uh, them foreigners coming in here and stealing American jobs; that could be you!
Okay, sure.
No.
So Rach, maybe you and I could fly out together Saturday.
Where in Cuba?
Oh.
That's okay, Joe.
Ah-ha, nowhere to run!
What'd you do, take him whaling?
Okay.
You really didn't know?
Hey, it's my list.
Okay, good luck
Is that why in junior high you were the only one that hung out with that Ukrainian kid?
Who's that?
Oh, I'm just over here with Ben. I thought we'd say hi.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Excuse me, I'm seizing. Mr. Treeger, here's another 50, happy Hanukkah. Will uh, will this help with the knob getting?
Hey, there's uh, some people outside, askin' about candy.
I am gonna see her again.
Yeah-No-but-but-but-but! We're just gonna go home and take a shower. Now, that's not scary right?
Yeah.
Believe me, it seems like less because they hid it from us for so long.
It's my joke.
Do not give him any money!
No!
He is my girlfriend's father, okay? It's-it's, it's weird!
Little girl misses her cat. Crazy lady thinks her mother is in a cat. Okay, y'know what, I have to go have dinner with my son, can I trust that when you see Phoebe, you will tell her.
We're sorry, Pheebs, we're sorry.
Well, yeah!
You don't believe in evolution?
No! No! No! No-no-no-no.
Yeah.
Hey!
Go, go, go!
Yeah! Right!
Joey! The vet said it's a simple procedure.
Right! So when Rigby got his samples back from the laboratory he made a startling discovery! What he believed to be igneous, was in fact sedimentary. Imagine his consternation when- Oh bloody hell.
Oh, they'll like me. Once they come to my awesome PAR-TAY! Okay, I gotta run. I gotta go get some nametags.
She looks so small.
So I'm a pimp huh? It's okay! Look, I know that sometimes I can be a pain in the ass, but you just have to talk to me. Tell me if something is bothering you. Okay? And for my part I will do everything I can to keep my annoying habits just .
Susan wanted a Chunky. We're having a baby, ok, a baby, you don't stop for Chunkys.
Not at the concert.
Well, I asked him if he wanted to eat, he said, "No." I asked him if he wanted to sleep, he said, "No." I asked him what he wanted to do, he said, "No." So, he's sweeping.
Yes, yes, fine, that is my penis. Can we be grown-ups now?
No, no, that-that, that's all right. Umm, I'm just glad you called.
We're just gonna be friends.
I know I miss you too. I can't wait to see you. I love you. Bye.
Yeah, that way I figure, ya know, we'll be far enough away from our parents that we don't have to see them all the time but close enough that they can come over and babysit whenever we want. And yes, I know, the taxes are a little higher than, let's say, Nassau county but the school system's supposedly great.
What? Okay, okay, okay, okay.
What? Wh- hello? The Millners' farm in Connecticut? The Millners, they had this unbelievable farm, they had horses, and, and rabbits that he could chase and it was- it w- .....Oh my God, Chi Chi!
Yeah, yeah man don't do it. I mean if you date her, then-then-then I can't date her.
Hey, does anybody want to get some lunch? All those in favor say I?
I... I do, I do not love Rachel. I'm gonna tell her right now about the whole thing so we can get this marriage annulled as fast as possible. Okay? Would I do that if I loved her?
Well, well I am married. Even though I haven't spoken to my wife since the wedding.
What-what are you doing?! Are you-Okay that's not funny! Just stop horsing around!
I like that.
Ok, Mom never hit.
And she just gave you this?
Yeah.
I love it, when we share.
Okay, we could still make dinner if we skipped the appetisers and asked for our check right away.
I was kinda, supposed to be on TV tonight for The Discovery Channel.
I just have to go, all right? Do I need a reason? Huh? I mean I have things to do with my life, I have a jam packed schedule, and I am late- for keeping up with it. Okay?
Look both, Joey and Monica feel the same way that I do. No-no-no-no.
Calm down. There's no reason to get testy.
So uh, what did you tell them about me?
Hi. Uh, I have been in the bathroom. Stay clear of the salmon mousse.
I don't know, but when I spoke to her, she said she had already passed the mucus plug.
What?
Yeah, well my-my ex-wife and I share custody of Ben and umm, uh, and just so you know, Carol and I are on excellent terms as I'm sure you are with your wife! Oh, I'm sorry! It's unbelievable!
I've got to say; I know I divorce a lot of women, never thought I would be divorcing you.
Well ah, Aunt Silvia was, well not a nice person.
Hey Rach, can you pass me the TV Guide?
God, that was, that was amazing, that was incredible. You guys, you guys kicked butt.
Yeah, I'm gonna stay and read my book. I just wanna be alone right now.
All right.
Maybe it's a universal thing?
Gunther! Gunther. Gunther, please tell me you didn't say anything to Rachel about me and the girl from the Xerox place.
Wow! Really?!
Yeah, well, he's a baby not a bomb.
Rach...
Now, if you need to stay late, I want to be supportive of that.
Fine. I'll go.
And bus.
What do I do now?
Oh-oh, Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger.
Oh, hey, if I make you laugh, here's an idea, why don't you invite Paulo over and have a little romp in the sack and I'll just stand in the corner and tell knock-knock jokes.
Oh. Listen, do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerability become any kind of a factor here-but do you think it would be okay if I asked you out? Sometime? Maybe?
What?!
Not her. Yeah, this is someone else I meet, and I-I can't decide between the two of them. Y'know the one from Poughkeepsie, even though she's a two hour train ride away, is really pretty, really smart, and-and a lot of fun. But this other girl, well, she lives right uptown. Y'know she's, well she's-she's just as pretty, I guess she's smart, she's not fun.
What?
No, no it's not interesting. OK, it's very, very not interesting. In fact it's actually 100 percent completely opposite of interesting.
Can we please focus here, a naked man's life hangs in the balance!
I don't know what to say.
Okay, this play, I want you to do a down and out to the right. Okay. Break!
I'm sorry I had to take such drastic measures to make my point, but I-look, I just want you guys to be safe. DANGER!!!!! Ahhh, huh? Unagi.
And somebody took a shot at me!
What? That's impossible.
Joey, some people don't like that.
That is so made up!
Rachel, this is your apartment.
Well, we won't wanna raise kids in the city so we'll probably move to uh, Scarsdale.
What do you mean? Nothing happened! I had to get out of there.
Great! Because Emily and I are getting married in a month!
Rach, Rach, I am so sorry. I am so-so sorry.
No no, you're uh, you're my lobster. See um, lobsters, uhh, in the tank when, when they're old, uhh, they get with, uhh, they walk around holding the claws. In the tank, ya know, with, with the holding and. . . Uhh, Phoebs you wanna help me out with the, the whole lobster thing?
Hey uh, this is Elizabeth.
Oh, you-you're-you're one to talk.
Carol, honey, shhh, shhh, everythings gonna be alright.
Oh uh, I had trouble remembering everyone's name, so I-I kinda came up with nicknames. Like the guy on the other side of you was Smelly von Brownshirt.
Oh.
Okay. Well, apparently Chandler's angry at us for not getting him a ticket to that Knicks game a couple of weeks ago.
So uh, Emily just went to the airport.
Damn! I can't believe I took her off my list.
Hi!
I was just thinking. When my time comes-
No, I'm getting back down 'cause she lives in Poughkeepsie. She seems really great, but she's like totally great, but she lives two and a half hours away.
No but, no but.
Yours, I just got 43 points for 'KIDNEY'.
What? No! No! I am not gonna hide it from Phoebe-Ooh, although I did get some great Pottery Barn sheets!
Hey. Oh, oh, how'd it go?
Oh, you and me?
So let's decide on the spending limit...
Yeah.
This is beautiful!
Oh, please...
Y'know what? I-I'm not even gonna talk about this. Okay? This little thing is over. I know you have a girlfriend! Okay--Yeah! And I know about the other professors! How do you think that makes me feel Ned?! You used me! You don't love me and you never did! Ah Professor Winston, Professor Fredrickson, I'll be right with you. Don't make this worse and I'll give you a C. Shall we?
They make you take an oath?
Hey guys!
Here you go, you can pay me back whenever you like.
No.
Yeah, you got it right? You got it right? You got it?
'That thing'? This is how you greet guests at a party? Let me ask you something, if I showed up here with my new girlfriend, she wouldn't be welcome in your home?
Okay! All clear!
Ok, well, if you do take him out for his walk, you might wanna bring his hat, and there's extra milk in the fridge, and there's extra diapers in the bag.
Chandler. I sensed it was you.
Hey guys, does anybody know a good date place in the neighborhood?
Oh for cryin' out loud!
Yeah?
Wow! Great! Wait, dad who-who's cigarettes are these?
I can do that. Oh-oh, what if she gets upset?
No, no, don't. Why don't we?
Oh that's nice.
What, so he was a little analytical. That's what he does, y'know? C'mon, he's not that bad.
Let's show 'em.
No!
He's right, what she did was unforgivable.
What am I looking at?
I couldn't possibly eat another bite.
Yeah!!
Dad, dad, please. Look I don't want anything to upset Emily tonight. Alright, she's had a hard enough couple of days as it is. Now here, here, let me go talk to him, okay?
Oh no-no-no! Oh-no! No! No! Emily!
I got itI'm getting it!
Ah, Cheryl!
I can't believe no one believes me!
You know what, this is ridiculous, ok. This is your birthday, this is your party. I say we just put 'em all together and if they can't deal with it, who cares.
I'll be right down.
I am sorry, Chandler.
Yeah! Anyway, I-I still think we should try to patch things up, y'know? Like uh, maybe we could get him to get tickets to another Knicks game and invite him.
No, a car backfired, but I thought somebody was taking a shot at me. And Rach, I...I survived! And I was filled with this-this great respect for life. Y'know? I-I want to experience every moment. I want to seize every opportunity. I-I am seeing everything so-so clearly now.
Well, y'know, monogamy can be a, uh, tricky concept. I mean, anthropologically speaking-
It went great! And I didn't need any jokes or naked chicks either!
A woman in my office is a lesiban. I'm just saying.
There was just an explosion, okay? My hearing would be impaired.
I'm gonna call her.
No. I... I wanted to be with you. I don't know, I feel like lately, I feel like you're slipping away from me, y'know. With this new job, and all these new people, and you've got this whole other life going on. I-I-I know it's dumb, but I hate that I'm not a part of it.
There you go. So she dips into her savings, that's what it's there for. She's gonna be fine, and if you need a little extra, you know where to find it.
Alright. : Your money's mine, Green.
Wow! That aspirin dance really works!
Oh please, can't I come to your special, magical cabin?
Mon, look who I ran into!
Oh my god! I'm so sorry, Cheryl. I must have freaked out.
Hey!
I'm taking my time, alright? I'm laying the groundwork. Yeah. I mean, every day I get just a little bit closer to...
Excuse me?
Open up. We want to talk to you.
Yay!
Who needs a lease when it's family!
Great! Great! You're making the bike very happy.
What?!
That said it was my sandwich?!
It could happen.
Wh-Hey-Whoa-whoa, where, where you going?!
Oh my God.
What? No! No, I'm not stopping. I'm Red Ross!
Sure, what's up?
Oh, but I've got tickets to the Van Gogh exhibit! I've been waiting like a year for this.
Okay. All right. So let's see, let's play from the trash can, to the lightpost. Right. Two hand touch, we'll kick off.
I'm shipping out tomorrow.
Oh my God, what happened?
Surely you can think of something good.
Look you're my wife. We're-we're married. Y'know? I-I love you. I-I really miss you.
Hey, there.
Ahem... I want.... OK, I want to... feel your... hot, soft skin with my lips.
Fine, I-I give up. Santa, Santa can stay.
She seems really, really fun!
Yeah, I'm-I'm sure. Yeah, get out of here before I change my mind.
Hi.
Where's Ben?
Cool!
In your mouth?!
No.
All right.
Doing great! Yes-yes-yes! Take control! Yes!
Yeah, just... just Nana stuff.
Oh yeah, yeah? Well uh, when we were going out, I read tons of porno magazines! 'Sup?
We were on a break!!! Okay!! We were, we were..., yeah. Where are you? I'll find you.
Save it.
You need me to go down there with you and hold your hand?
The one that always stares at me when I come in?
Nothing. Nothing nothing nothing.
Basically, Rachel and I were in Vegas and we got drunk...
I mean, I don't feel like I even have a girlfriend anymore.
Please don't say naked chicks.
So uh, Emily called last night...
Every week, the TV Guide comes to Chandler and Joey's apartment. What name appears on the address label?
Hey, what have you guys been up to?
He's coming here for Thanksgiving!
Over my dead body!
What do you think you're doing?!
Oh, great. Great. There was a projectile, uh, throwing up incident, but he started it.
Yeah, no problem.
Bunny!
What's goin' on?
That's no problem.
What?
Petty...
Why? Why can't you go to him?
A little bit.
I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father.
Hey, Pheebs.
Hey!
But, won't she notice I have makeup on?
Oh, actually I haven't even been home yet. Do you mind if I check my messages?
The game, Rachel, the game. You owe us money for the game.
Only way to fly.
Thanks Aunt Pheebs. Hey, you didn't microwave that, did you, because it's breast milk, and you're not supposed to do that.
Who is Maria?
Listen, I'm in Elizabeth's bathroom...
'Cause there's time to make up for that. We can do stuff together. You always wanted to go to that Colonial Williamsburg. How 'bout we do that?
You uh, you may have been right about Jill.
Okay, okay, fine, you're right. Let's ah, let's take a break, let's cool off, okay, let's get some frozen yogart, or something..
Good, so do I
ON A CAT??!!!!
Look, can, can you do something for me?
Wow! I could've died tonight.
I'll help you. Yeah, I'll make up a schedule and make sure you stick to it. And plus, it'll give me something to do.
Yeah, 'cause life's just that kind.
Oh, I am very in.
Yes, we have something we have to get to.
Ah Joey, I don't think you get to pick the cities.
Would you look at that guy, I mean how long has he been talking to her. It's like, back off buddy she's a waitress not a geisha.
Excuse me?
And on your anniversary, for shame!
It's awful I know, I mean, I feel terrible but I have to do this if I want my marriage to work. And I do, I have to make this marriage work. I have too. But the good thing is we can still see each other until she gets here.
No. No. Nothing happened. I shut the drapes to uh, show her slides of my favorite fossils.
Hey. When you guys were kids and you played Happy Days, who were you? I was always Richie.
Well, it's not for sure but umm, we met this guy in the park who thought Ben was really cute--y'know, which he is--so umm anyhoo, he uh, he gave us his card and told us to bring him down for this commercial he's auditioning.
Got it!
Knock-knock.
The way he makes me feel about myself.
I've seen her at work, but I always figured, ah-huh? But, uh, I made her dinner. We had a great time. And we're going out again tomorrow.
Well, I'm going to take off. Congratulations man.
Oh, oh Chandler...
No-no-no! Only if I promise never to see Rachel again.
It was, it was great. Oh, what happened?
I didn't get the annulment.
So do I. Okay Rach, before anything happens I just want to lay down a couple of ground rules. This is just about tonight. I don't to go through with this if it's going to raise the question of "Us." Okay? I just want this to be about what it is!
Yeah but, on the bright side, we get to be roommates again.
Really. It's always been you, Rach.
Yeah, which she probably stole from some cheerleader.
Well, Chandler and I are in a bar...
No. No, uh, Phoebs? You can'tyou can't do...
That's right good things, that-that is what I said.
Y'know, if, if this is too weird for you, we can still back out at...
Come on, you-you can't tell me you actually believe that-that there's a woman inside that cat!
Tough noogies, we're watching Predators of the Serengetti.
Your joke? Well, I think 'the Hef' would disagree, which is why he sent me a check for one hundred ah-dollars.
It's okay. Come, come on in.
Okay, stay calm. Nothing is going to happen to you, you are not in that much trouble.
Ooooohhhh.
Help!
Naa.
Okay, Mon, I really don't think this is the... Okay, you're dialing, you are dialing.
Right.
What a pity stay?
Yeah!!
Cool! Dad! My report cards! Hey, check this out dad, Math, A. Science, A. History, A. Gym... Oooh, my rock polisher!
That commercial always makes me so sad.
She's not- past, she's present, she's back.
Hey, hey buddy, Marcel. Marcel. In the jungle, the mighty jungle the lion sleeps tonight. In the jungle, the mighty jungle the lion sleeps tonight. a-weema-way, a-weema-way.....
Hi! What are you, what are you doing here?
That's funny. Umm.... It's not funny.
Whoa-whoa-whoa! Emily, honey, okay?
You know, that Steffi Graf has quite a tush. I'm just saying, it's right there.
Oh I'm, I'm making this too hard. Okay, what do you want me to do.
I don't think charging new clothes too your dad qualifies as making it on your own.
But we haven't seen each other since then. Well I land in China, guess who's in charge of the dig.
What difference does that make?!
Thanks.
Oh. What's wrong with Ross?
Yeah. Ya know, a boy and a girl. Hopefully the girl will come first so Ben here won't feel too competitive.
Good call!
Oh...my...God! I-I see what this is! You are in love with Rachel!
Now, hold on! Hold on! Look, look, your daughter and I are supposed to leave tonight for our honeymoon, now-now you-you tell her that I'm gonna be at that airport and I hope that she'll be there too! Oh yeah, I said Rachel's name, but it didn't mean anything, Okay? She's-she's just a friend and that's all! That's all! Now just tell Emily that I love her and that I can't imagine spending my life with anyone else. Please, promise me that you'll tell her that.
I mean, uh, who... who cares about a little sloppiness?
There might be, a teeny, tiny, possibility.
No-no, one daddy, two mommies. All right, it's all yours.
She hates Pottery Barn?!!
Yeah, hey I-I have clothes, I even pick them out. I mean for, for all you know I could be a fashion..... monger.
No, just give me another minute.
Hey.
Oh, I don't, I don't, I don't know...
Well, I'm just saying, I mean why else would he just, y'know, swoop in out of nowhere for no reason.
Chandler's gone again!
Uh no-no, she-she's out for the night.
I am very...very sorry.
Oh, oh my God, is this the wrong day? I don't believe it, uh, well, hey, I guess if it works out we'll, we'll have something to tell the grandkids.
Well, what is she goes down and-and sleeps with a bunch of guys?
You do, huh?
I know. I know.
Oh but I-I-I haven't paid you yet!
This screen is amazing, I mean Dick Van Dyke is practically life-size.
I assume we're looking for an answer more sophisticated than 'to get you into bed'.
C'mon, what, you never think about our future?
Fun? Where was the fun? Tell me specifically, which part was the fun part? Where's my puck?
Really.
Yeah?
Right. No biggie. Stay loose.
Mon, look at yourself. You have cookie on your neck.
Great to see you!
Yeah!
Not that big a deal? It's amazing. Ok, you just reach in there, there's one little maneuver, and bam, a bra right out the sleeve. All right, as far as I'm concerned, there is nothing a guy can do that even comes close. Am I right?
Uh-uh-Wow! Uh, I thought you guys were just like making jokes, I had no idea. What you know what? You guys are wrong. Uh yes, there is a chronological age difference but I never notice it. You know why? Because she is very mature. Besides, it doesn't really matter to me what you guys think. I mean, I'm the one dating Elizabeth, not you!
Oh, somebody's feeling better.
Hey lady! I don't care how much you want it! Okay?! I am not gonna to have sex with you in the bathroom!
You are, you're welling up.
Kristen, hi. Are you uh, new to the area, 'cause if you are...I'd love to show you around sometime.
Thanks. Thanks. And thanks again.
Yeah? Sometimes it's...
Right.
All right. Feel good?
No, no you don't understand the animal hospital is way across town he's choking I don't know what else to do.
Yeah. There's no breaking them up, is there?
I guess it could.
Oh no! It could be better, but it's gonna be okay, right?
Hey. Happy Thanksgiving!
Oh yeah, nobody knows. And we're not supposed to ask.
Chandler, have you ever put on a black cocktail dress and asked me up to your hotel room?
All right! All right! Chandler entered a Vanilla Ice look-a-like contest and won!
Well this uh, this may be a little awkward.
Sure.
Maybe I'll take her to that new French restaurant down the street...
That'll be a neat trick, when you're, when you're dead!
I'm starving!
Look, you were right. She looks at me and sees a friend, that's all. But then I met Julie, and I don't know, we're havin' a great time. And I have to say, I never would've gone for it with her if it hadn't been for you.
Yes, and the dimmer switch.
When did Rigatoni get back from Rome?
Emily?!
No, it turns out that the one from uptown was making a joke. But it was a different joke than I thought-it wasn't that funny. So I'm still torn.
Fifteen.
Little louder, okay, I think there's a man on the twelfth floor in a coma that didn't quite hear you...
Yes, yes, fine, that is my penis. Can we be grown-ups now?
No, no, Carol. There's nothing wrong with it. I just, I just don't think breast milk is for adults.
Well, is this Hillary your HOT assistant chef Hillary?
Hi Tushie.
God that is the most beautiful engagement ring ever!
People can hear you.
Well, Emily's willing to work on the relationship.
Oh, thanks!
Yeah! Se vice?
Ohh, this cake is really good!
What?! That's not gonna make you any money!
No touch! No touch!
You are? Me, too!
Nobody likes change.
In the bank.
No Chandler, everything! Like stuff you like, stuff she likes, technique, stamina, girth....
All right, all right, it's just that you left a red sock in with all your whites, and now, everything's kinda pink.
Gunther?!
How weird is that? Y'know? You're moving in with me and have the one thing I don't have. It's like uh, in a way you-you complete me kitchen.
What's going on?
Pepper?
Oh.
She said, "Thank you." I said, "I love you." And she said, "Thank you."
She said what?
Ohh...
Twice.
I know!
So you wanna watch uh, Entertainment Tonight?
I don't know. Soap?
I was not!
No! And somehow, we ended up with a joint checking account.
Look, were down to just one point. Could we please, maybe just settle it after the wedding.
Oh my God..
Oh really, really great! Yeah! A-actually she's right down the street, umm, do-do you know what? You should stop bye and say hi.
Oh here, I think this is us. Yeah.
Oh, thanks, Pheebs!
I'm fine! I saw a psychiatrist at work today.
No, because she hasn't come home yet. And she hasn't been home all night! She's obviously staying with that other guy, and I'm the stupid moron who spent the whole night outside her apartment!
Okay. What ah, what is the matter with you? What's going on?
Well, you can't know where I am all the time. Look, this marriage is never gonna work if you don't trust me.
Are you insane? C'mere, Marcel, c'mon.
Ooohhhh!!
Well, I tried! But when I got to my lawyer's office all I could hear was, "Three divorces. Three divorces!" Look, I just don't want my tombstone to read, Ross Gellar, Three Divorces.
Oh. And how was the date?
No, actually I was just saying it looks like we're not sitting together. But now you mention it, there was ice there that night... It was the first frost...
You see, and you thought she'd be judgemental.
Hey-hey, since you're the 'fix-it' lady, here's a pickle, what do you do when the bride says she doesn't want to have the wedding at all?
Thank you!
He didn't get the goggles!
Ah. Joey you're-you're having lunch with my mom?
Come on, two on one.
Animal sex, animal sex? So what're you saying, I mean, you're saying that like, there's nothing between us animal at all. I mean there's not even like, uhm, a little animal, not even, not even like, like chipmunk sex?
Thank you!
Uhhhh... Joey cried last night.
Well, Rachel's having drinks with him tonight.
Fighting?!
When did I say you were boring?!
Joey, you owe $1100 at I Love Lucite.
No? What happened, big guy?
Hey, y'know what nickname never caught on? The Ross-A-Tron!
Oh, it's my new beeper.
Uh Joey, that's just the minumum amount due, that's your total due.
Hey, do uh, do you have a minute?
It's nothing, I just gave her a hug.
Remember? You-you were eating pizza.
Hey!
I can't believe it! He's looking right at us!
Uh... to the bathroom.
Will you-will you please?
No, no, I was turnin' the knob and, and. . . here it is.
Well sure. But I get married all the time so...
So listen ah, I picked Monica for secret Santa, but I'm already getting her something for Chanukah, I was wondering if you wanna switch.
Fine by me; hope she wins.
Alright, I want my monkey.
Hey! Uh, Phoebe's not here is she?
Yeah, right!
Phoebe, why'd you do it?
I know, why not?
You were incredible! Brand new woman, ladies and gentlemen.
Wow! Thanks, you guys. That's uh-ohhh, I wanna, I wanna play you another piece! Umm! Uh-oh! I left my uh, helicopter sounds on another disk. I'll be right back! Okay? This is so nice, I'm-I am so...
Phoebe, oh my God! Wh-wh-what are you doing here?
What? What-what, what are talking about? It-it worked with you.
You've got to help me my monkey swallowed a 'K'!
Yeah-yeah you guys. Get out of here!
What?
You bet. In the U.S., China, Africa, all over.
Yes, but I've lived here for 25 minutes.
Ohh! A man with a plan!
I have no idea. I mean... But-but I assure you I will figure it out.
Isabella Rosselini.
That's it, your doing great.
Well..
My doctoral dissertation is in the library at school, I went to see it, and there were students makin' babies right in the middle of the Paleontology section!
What big thing?
What are you doing? Are you trying to hurt me? Or something?
Yeah!
No, but, but I wanna be with you in spite of all those things.
Okay, okay, okay, I've got two cabs and no people. Go! Go! Go!
Yeah, yeah. I got a lemon schmush.
Dude, I need to talk to you a sec.
Hey Chandler. Monica!
Hey guys!
What's the score?
I don't know, I don't think mom and dad would mind. Remember when you were 9 and Richard was 30, how dad used to say, 'God I hope they get together.'
You and your ice.
Umm, Jo's a girl, it's short for Josephine.
Oh yeah!
Okay. Well, you be careful.
Oh! Listen umm, I, I just stopped by to see if you wanted to see this play tonight. Umm, it's supposed to be excellent. The director is the same...
Yeah!
What?
What, we-uh- we don't have shoes here, or...?
Oh no-no-no-no!
This is my wedding.
Sorry.
Not only did we go out, we did it 298 times!
Anyone want me to appraise anything?
No.
There's nothing the matter with me. See, I'm not completely devoid of sentiment, see I have feelings.
Hi, Pheebs!
Oh look, did, did you just see that? Did you see? He just waved, he just waved, he's never waved before, you've never waved before. Yes he has. Very good.
Practical jokes.
Fine, you're right. Let's ah, let's take a break, let's cool off, okay, let's get some frozen yoghurt, or something..
You will?!
These-these are beads of joy.
Oh my God, he just said your name, that's great! Good job Ben.
Tell me about it. So what, what's your magic number?
Look, you'll get there. You're an amazing chef.
Yeah, yeah, everybody's here. Hey, everybody, say hi to Julie in New Mexico.
I love you.
I just, I don't understand, I mean, how-how can she do this? Y'know, what, am I, am I like a complete idiot for thinking that she'd actually show up?
Okay, Phoebe, this Dr. Oberman. He has no strong feelings about Fonzie or any of the Happy Days gang.
This was Carol's favorite beer. She always drank it out of the can, I should have known.
Okay, good stuff. Umm, well she's-she's sweet and pretty and...
So, what? That's it?
Somebody seems to be missing being the hostess.
So it's looks like we're the first ones here.
Not even, say, breaking up with Janice?
Just the one divorce in '99! Y'know what, I am gonna be happy this year. I am gonna make myself happy.
I swear!
No! The reason I'm asking is that... I sorta had one last night.
Hey!
Still I could tell. She was into me. Well, why don't you set us up?
Yeah, what's going on?
No, you started it.
Yeah, they print jokes, interviews, hard-hitting journalism. It's not just about the pictures.
Sometimes I wonder if I did the right thing, ya know, giving him away.
Ugh. Well, we're just gonna have to jump. Yeah. Now, we're gonna have to make sure to land to the right of that patch of ice, okay? Not hit the dumpster on the other side and uh, and try to avoid that-that weird brownish red stuff in the middle. So, when you get down there...you go up to the roof and you let me in.
Okay, Monica: Right foot red.
What?!
Good luck!
Okay, if you'll excuse me, I-I'm gonna go hang out with some people who don't know the Space Mountain story.
Oh yeah, Emily convinced me to do it.
Oh really? Well I-I guess Monica should know about Atlantic City.
Yeah, make that three.
Uhh, naa, no no no, I, I must be thinking of someone else, uh, maybe me. Don't you have some folding to do? Go fold dear. Fold. You fold.
Hi. Mom. Dad.
OH MY GOD!! I didn't really believe it until you just said it!!
Oh.
Ohhh.
That's right, and that's why we celebrate Hanukkah today. The end.
It was, it was okay.
You bug me.
A date.
Uh, Rachel, I've been thinking. I don't think us getting together tonight is such a good idea. I'm calling it off.
Phoebe really likes the bike huh?
No wait, look. Look! I'm sorry, it's just I've never even met Howard. I-I mean I don't know Howard.
Okay.
That, for all I knew would, could last forever. That to me is a break-up.
What?!
Great. Great.
Thank you.
Hey!
Then don't do that, alright?
The routine!
You can have the last piece, if you want.
Okay, I've got to go pick up Ben but I-I will figure something out. Hey, didn't he used to have a cat?
Yeah.
So you guys having any luck getting rid of the entertainment center?
All right. Uhh, international.
Hey, here's a question; where did you guys get the finest oak East of the Mississippi?
That is really nice...lying! No way is that the reason!
How about you?
What, you didn't get it? The doctor is a monkey.
Uh, excuse me, uh, where can we find the monkey?
Oh, we have to get you an engagement present?
Funny, my birthday was seven months ago.
Emotional hell. So, did they lend you the money yet?
Yeah. Listen, can you keep this information to yourself?
Really.
No, God no! That is no place for a woman. Those guys will grab anything.
It's the off light. Right Ross?
You want me to call her right now?
What do you mean?
Look, check this out. Is it a coffee table, is it a panther? There's no need to decide.
Why did you hate me?
So, uh, the other night Rachel and I are in bed talking about fantasies, and I happened to describe a particular Star Wars thing....
Yes, yes I am. Are you a, uh, a friend of Rachel's?
Yeah that! You know I hate practical jokes! They're mean and they're stupid and-and I don't want my son learning them!
Yeah, I know, I uh, I tried them on.
Now I'm depressed! ... Even more than I was.
About the yelling.
Oh, we were helping Chandler write his vows, but he kicked us out because Joey kept making inappropriate suggestions.
Yeah, take your time.
Nothing, it's just that hypnosis is beyond crap.
What? Whoa, whoa whoa whoa, what do you mean, back to Jordie? We never landed on Jordie. We just passed by it during the whole Jessy, Cody, Dylan fiasco.
What, do you, well umm, oh how about I come up there?
Yeah! Got it!
No, no, I'm serious. Thank you.
Y'know your probably not allowed to sleep with any of your students.
Yeah, I recognize the ankles!
Fine, I'm mentally unstable.
Well, maybe the crazy fog has lifted and she realises that life without me.... a-sucks.
Right?
Ooh, Ooh.
You are totally jealous.
Well, I was with Carol for like eight years and I lost her. And now if it's possible I think I love you even more. So, it's hard for me to believe that I'm not gonna, well that someone else is not going to take you away.
No, no, wait, ok, ok, look at the other side. Look at Julie's column.
Yeah, it's-it's tough being single. That's why I'm so glad I found Amanda.
Why?! Are there like bears or something?! Ohh. Oh, protection. Yeah-no, yeah-no, that-that-that I forgot.
Not for tonight. Not for tonight! Wh-what, what, what, are you doing?
Here she comes. Don't say a word, okay? Just be cool, don't be...y'know you.
Uh okay, well there's-there's wine in the kitchen.
Because It's The Highest. Situation No.1 You're with Monica, the wedding is about to start when Monica gets cold feet. Go!
You know what, I think we've had all the bad luck we're going to have.
It's not that. Okay? Annulments are more complicated than I...
Oh-oh really? Did you confuse it with your own turkey sandwich with a Moist Maker?
Yeah. I'm paying you to stop.
What is it?
Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, but then the coffee table won't be centered in the seating area.
So are you sure about this whole moving in thing?! I mean it's a really big step! And-and what's the rush?!
No! No! I'm not! It's-it's-it's perfect! I mean it's better than you just-just moving here, 'cause it's us together forever, and that's-that's what I want.
They put that in.
You slept with my sister?
No-no, I got the edge. I know it's not exactly ethical but I sent him a little bribe to
I just wanted to tell you something before you heard it from someone else and I hope this isn't too weird, but uh, I had uh, a thing with Janice. What you're-you're not mad?
This is crazy! I mean, yes-yes Rachel is my good friend and I-I have loved her in the past, but now, she is just my wife! Phoebe, will you-will you help me out here?
That ring? When my grandmother first came to this country, that ring and the clothes on her back were all she had with her.
Okay!
Oh, I'm threatened by you?
So, are you gonna see him again?
So, um, what do you do for a living?
What?! What?! Talking about what?!
Hi.
Yes! Wow, well, that-that was easy. Okay, you-you go.
Challenge excepted.
Hello.
Oh, now you can exchange them if you want, ok.
Well, I mean if uh, if Emily gave me a choice...
Uhh, believe me when he's older, he'll understand.
Yeah. Hey, remember the time I jammed that pencil into your hand?
It's still a gift! I got it from the gift shop!
Gunther have you uh, have you seen Chandler?
You're wrong.
Oh I-, Oh wait, Tony can you hang on? That's the other line. Hello. Oh yeah she's here but uh, can she call you back? OK thanks. Call Joanna. Hi.
Who the hell is Jordie?
Hey, Joey. Are men ever nice to strange women for no reason?
Is everything okay?
Bummer.
You did! Oh.... I always figured you just thought I was Monica's geeky older brother.
So that's the only reason she could be here huh? It couldn't have anything to do with the fact that-that maybe I'm a good listener and I uh I put on a great slide show!
What?!
Good! Me neither! So it's not a problem. We're just two friends who happen to be roommates.
What guys? Oh, yeah.
There you go. Thank you!
Yeah.
Hey!
Okay, see ya later.
Hey!
Mike "Gandolf" Ganderson, only like the funest guy in the world.
What?!
Yes, hello. I have a question. Umm, I used your pen to draw on my friend's face. A beard and a moustache. Thank you. No, she didn't think so. I know it's like anyway, umm well make-up didn't cover it and we've tried everything to get it off and nothing's worked. What-what do we do? Yeah. Uh-huh. Yeah. Oh! Okay. Okay, thank you! Yeah, it's not coming off.
Hey, what took you guys so long? Your cab left when ours did!
Whoo!
Uh-huh.
What, that wasn't the great news?
And in my defense, the cleaning lady came on to me!
So where are we going next?
Okay, it's not, it's not.
Hey!
So um...Thanksgiving. The holiday season is upon us, hm?
Hi!
All right.
Petty...
Oh sweetie, when do you think you're going to get off tonight?
Phoebe! You're note, amazing! Not only did no one touch my sandwich, but people at work are actually afraid of me. Yeah, a guy called me mental! Mental Geller, yeah, I always wanted a cool nickname like that.
Okay! You take care!
Oh right. Right. Ooh, remember the time I uh, I pinned you down and tickled you 'til you cried? We're probably too old to do that now.
Yeah, I mean... I think when it's your shot, y'know, you-you know it's your shot. Did it... feel like your shot..?
Cassie?
They kept your room for a while.
Wow. Umm... Huh... I'm-I'm not sure what to do with that right now.
Wow! You-you look great!
What?! Give-give me a brush.
Is Rachel here? I gotta talk to her.
Well, yeah. I can't-I can't stay here all night, and if I go in there she's-she's gonna wanna... do stuff.
Hey! What's up?
That's correct. Ladies?
Yeah?
You're right. Yours is worse. You are the king of bad Thanksgivings.
I am not in love with her. She was very upset about having to move out so I eh, didn't tell her we were still married because she would only get more upset. I-I just comforted her, as a friend.
Oww!! Son of a...!! Ow! Come on!
Is this?!
Woooo!!!
So do you have like any nuclear weapons on board?
Jill, how did you pay for all this? I thought your dad took away your credit card.
No no no, I mean, hey, why shouldn't I be happy for you? What would it say about me if I couldn't revel in your joy? I'm revelling baby, believe me!
Huh!
Oh, we went to see a collection of Victorian doorknobs and the Cupert-Hewitt museum.
It's, uh... it's endearing, really.
It's your joke.
Well, why don't you just start with something simple. Like umm, Monica from the moment I met you, I knew I loved you.
Well, ya know, they're a little behind the times in Colonial Williamsburg.
Hi!
Meth-methane smells...
Happy birthday!!!
What?
Hey everybody, Pheebs is here!
I'm sorry, my pie was, was in your hood. Now I just have to get the coffee out of that guy's pants and I'll be back in the hospital by 7.
So, uh, Rachel, what are you, uh, what're you doing tonight?
Until we start to look very small.
Oh, taking my parents back to the hotel.
Thank you! And I have to say that first scene when you meet Mac...
Why not?
Of course he is! What, do you think I'd just use my son as-as an excuse? What kind of father do you think I am?
No, I mean, look I don't know if anything is going to happen with us, again. Ever. But I don't want to know that it-it never could. So I stopped it and she got mad and broke my projector.
Why?
Mon?
Perfect. Perfect. So now everybody's getting kissed but me.
Whip it out, whip it out.
Cool!
Yep.
What?
Oh well that's great, so I guess this is ah, this is good bye then. Huh? Good bye.
Hey!
Hey Rach, can I talk to you outside for a second?
No, it's not just 'cause I'm jealous. I mean I'm not, I'm not, I'm not jealous, okay? It's... Look, the guy, he screamed, he actually screamed at this couple sitting in our seats.
Know what-If somebody doesn't tell me what's going on right now...
Howard?
No tongue.
At the vet.
Thanks for being born.
What?! You totally get embarrassed!
What?
Oh my God, oh- is today the twentieth, October twentieth?
Yes! Yes! Yes!!
Emily!
...As in Mouse?
Well you need 60% to pass...
Yeah, y'know the ah, the girlfriend I told you about last night? Well it turns out she ah, she wants to get back together with me. Oh, I found it!!
Yes, yes I am. And you are a....
Phoebe, how could you do this to me?!
I-I-I...
Look at that, look at that, see how she's pushing him away and he won't budge. Alright, I'm gonna do something. Excuse me, are you Rachel?
Look, I don't feel like dancing, I feel like having a drink. Okay?
Whoa, whoa, whoa. You looked at her. You never look. You just answer, it's just a reflex. Do I look fat? Nooo! Is she prettier than I am? Noo! Does size matter?
Sure.
So listen uh, I know you and I haven't really had a chance to talk since uh, Emily and I decided to get married, and uh, I was just wondering how you were.
We met at Phoebe's birthday party, I'm, I'm Ross Geller.
Tell me about it.
Come on, show them to me.
You're gonna be an aunt.
All right I guess I'm, gonna go pack.
Did you tell your sister to ask me out?
What?
Oh-oh, guess what? I-I have a date with Elizabeth Hornswoggle.
I'm just sayin' if dogs do experience jet lag, then, because of the whole um, seven dog years to one human year thing, then, when a dog flies from New York to Los Angeles, he doesn't just lose three hours, he loses like a week and a half.
Why are you mad at me?
Take thee, Rachel... Emily. Emily.
What happened?!!
Okay.
Ohh, it's Joey! I love Joey!
This is fun. Hey Rach, remember that whole "We were on a break thing?" Well, I'm sorry, will you marry me?
... and that's the story of the dreidle. Now, some people trace the Christmas tree back to the Egyptians, who used to bring green palm branches into their huts on the shortest day of the year, symbolising life's triumph over death. And that was like 4000 years ago.
Yeah!
Ok, here, here. There we go.
The sex? Um, I'm having enough trouble with the image of you and Susan together, when you throw in Tanya , yaw...
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa, Joey!
Oh, mine's December...
No! No no, it is nothing like me and Carol!
Mon, speaking of which, dad says he knows someone you can call for an interview.
Yeah! Rach?
No, no, really, I've got to take the car back anyway, I'm spending all day tomorrow with Ben, It's fine, no guilt I promise.
Phoebe?
No, go on! It's Paul the Wine Guy!
Ah, so then his plane didn't explode in a big ball of fire?... Just a dream I had- but, phew.
Quack, quack..
Why does anyone have to be naked?
Can I ask you something? Have you ever had a guy have a crush on you?
Dude, we got to talk.
Because I am bored...Out of my mind. I've already been to the bank, post office, and the dry cleaners.
No, that's all right.
And tell them what? The naked guy we stare at all the time isn't moving.
Hey, y'know, Mon, if things wrong out between you and Richard's son, you'd be able to tell your kids, that you slept with their grandfather.
DANGER!!!!
You can't just call Godfather. Don't you think her brother should be Godfather?
No, no, no, no. Tick, tick, tick, tick.
...will be two months...
Oh wait-wait-wait! The message is blinking. Maybe you didn't erase it.
Before the snap!
Oh, Pheebs, I'm sorry, Ive got to go. Ive got Lamaze class.
It's not something you are! It's something you have!
They don't look any bigger than me!
No way.
Okay, quick and painful.
What?
Hey!
Oh-oh-okay, but-but I know, that even though I've been a-a complete idiot up 'til now, I mean, I mean you-you-you have to come here. You have to come here so we can work this out.
Me too!
Yeah!
Okay, first of all, I don't play with cheaters, and second of all, you know I had swollen glands!!
I'm gonna use the cushion.
Oh good, you scared me for a minute.
Monica, Monica, your guest are turning into jerky, OK.
I gave him an extremely professional massage!
When did I say that?
Hey Chandler, what are you doing tonight?
Hello! What's this? Oh right its that girl's phone number. Yeah-yeah, there it is, just a phone number a really hot girl gave me. It's no big deal, I mean it is her home phone number, but... Whoa! Whoa-whoops, I almost lost this baby! Yeah, the lovely Amanda gives me her number and I-I go and drop it.
Gandolf the wizard. Hello! Didn't you read Lord of the Rings in high school?
Look Rach if-if you want to go for a ride in the Porsche I'll be glad to take you for a quick spin around the block.
Well y'know 'cause Rachel and I used to go out.
What are you doing here, Santa?
Uh, I'm not really a shot drinking kinda guy.
Can I ask you somethin'?
That was 14 hours ago.
Alright. There's a theory, put forth by Richard Leakey-
Oh, come on it's only three blocks! And-and, it's not very heavy, try it! Come on! Come on!
Sure! Oh, and Joey's got the mashed potatoes if you want to exchange them.
No, sorry I don't. Tell me why would anyone pay someone to scar their body for life? What if it doesn't come out right Phoebe? Then it's like, I don't know, havin' a bad hair cut all the time. Why's everyone staring at me?
Hey!
Oh.
Oh mom! Okay, umm, her name is Carol. And she's really pretty. And smart. And uh, she's-she's on the lacrosse team and the golf team. Can you believe it? She plays for both teams!
Put it back exactly where you found it?
All right, ready?
What-what is it?!
I tired attacking two women, did not work.
Were you the ones called the cops?!
Come on, man! Just-just take the sweats off. Okay? Just take 'em off and we'll have some fun.
Hey!
Uh.
Go Joe!!!
I am dressed.
Pop it in.
I loved this place! To tell you the truth, I wish I didn't have to move.
Why is it inside out?!
Hey!
No, Susans gonna be there too. Weve got dads, weve got lesbians, the whole parenting team.
No?
It's really a uh-uh three person game, y'know?
So it's really a question of who could you have possibly done.
Mon.
Oh, great! Listen, oh I had to get you a whole new battery. I got you the best one I could, 'cause that's not where you want to skimp.
Er.... um.....
Um, yeah.
Why don't you come, I mean, I-I have two tickets, why not?
We know!
Hey, uh, I'm really, really sorry about what happened in the cafeteria today.
OK. Here goes. For a while now, I've been wanting to, um....
So Rachel called. Wants to see me. Going over in a minute.
Thanks, Dad, really, I ju... you know, I just, I just needed to know, um... when did you start to feel like a father?
Oh yeah! So ah, kinda pretty, pretty good. He sounds like a nice, good guy.
No-no-no, it's just a bit sudden. No, it's great. Okay? I'm totally on board. I love you too, all righty. Bye.
Y'know actually it does have a very interesting history. Uh, this street is the first street in the city to have an underground sewer system. Before that sewage and waste would just flow right down the street. Yeah, sometimes ankle deep!
Hi.
No no, no, that, that's your Christmas tip, alright. Oh, hey, do you think there's a chance you could fix that radiator now?
Yeah but Pottery Barn! Y'know what I think? It's just she-she's weird. Y'know it's because she's a twin. Twins are weird.
It's okay if he bumps his head, kids bump their heads all the time, y'know, it was your first time babysitting, I figured you did the best you could.
You hated me when we were kids?
Yay!
'Kay!
What the? What...
Oooooh.
Joey, you look nothing like Ben.
Joshua...guy at that club, dancing and having a good time, the thought of it kinda...y'know.
How'd did it go?
One, two, three, four!
Gas? Wow! Intense.
We're looking into it.
Well ah, actually...
What am I doing?
Hey. So I uh, I didn't get that apartment. Some problem with my application.
Hey!
That little naked guy would be me.
Thanks. Yeah, Carol borrowed it for a class, and I have to get it back to the museum.
No, this is pretty much it.
I can do that.
59 seconds. Quartz, ha.
Oh, and also, he's, he's walkin' kind of funny, his left leg is moving a lot faster than his right leg, and he's in there just sort of y'know...
No the man's right, that's what I had with Rachel.
Who?
What?
No-no.
One more day, seriously/
So, I just picked up a message from Emily, she and Susan are going to a poetry reading together!
Alright you kids, bye now.
Come on. You gotta help me figure out what to do. Okay?
I don't know, I told her it was stupid to put off the wedding just because the hall was gone and she liked flipped out.
Joey, please!
Freakish.
That's different, okay. That's like, uh 'Who dated a stripper?' or 'Who did it on the back of the Staton Island Ferry?'.
Mom, there are so many people in my life. Some of them are seeing people and some of them aren't. Is that crystal?
Hi.
Grab a spoon. Do you know how long it's been since I've grabbed a spoon? Do the words 'Billy, don't be a hero' mean anything to you?
I... I don't know what you are talking about.
Anyone else? Huh? Bring 'em on!
People are doing it in front of my book!
Cool.
Well, eww. What? Is it a pimple?
Well thanks!
Alright, alright, now-now who should I say tricked me into doing it?
Hey.
My-my ring? My-my wedding ring? The-the stripper stole my wedding ring?! H-how?! How could this all happen?!
No really, I mean, I mean, God, I could use a friend.
Yeah! Got it!
Oh okay, lift it straight up over your head! Straight up over your head! You can do it! You can do it! Okay. You got it?
That's too bad.
Man, look at all those stars! Infinite space. It really, really makes you wonder, doesn't it?
Can I, can I help you with something?
You were at the coffeehouse!
That's okay.
I would say that.
Where'd you get fruit at four in the morning?
Yeah, yeah. It wasn't every morning.
hey, fella! How you doing?
She's talking.
What is this?!
Hi!
Is that what I want?
Oh absolutely! It has been in my family for generations, and every bride who has worn it has had a long and happy life.
OK, what's the longest you've been in the relationship before ha, have, having the sex?
Get married.
Oh, come here sweetie, listen, you're gonna go on like a thousand interviews before you get a job. That's not how that was supposed to come out.
Come on up. I'm gonna get the rest of his stuff together.
Hmm?
You're right, you're right, it is.
Yeah, that's okay, I mean if you guys all have to go away for the first weekend I'm alone by myself, y'know then I totally, totally understand.
All right, show's over. Nothing to see here. Ok, let's do laundry.
Look, I don't have to answer your questions! Okay? I'm a big boy, I can do whatever I want!
No, it's for when Carol goes into labor. She can get me wherever I am. I mean, all she has to do is to dial 55-JIMBO.
Hiiiiii.
Yeah.
Here, check it out. It's the first one, too.
I missed you too.
Thank you.
No thanks. I'm 29.
Yeah, yeah, what is it?
You're not serious, I mean, you really... you really talk to it?
Hey! Everyone.
'Cause Carol's a lesbian. And, and I'm not one. And apparently it's not a mix and match situation.
C'mon Monica, do it. Hey, you guys, um, Monica has some news.
Uh, hold, let me see, I don't know. So what're you gonna do. . .
Oke-dokey.
Yes, of course they like you!
I know. That's why I did it. Come on, are they really that bad?
That only took me an hour.
Uh, hello, the buzzer buzzed. It doesn't count.
I'm going to China.
So uh, have a great time down there.
Bye.
I, I know it's big, I just didn't know it was uh, ha-ha big.
Yes, I do.
Well, I don't know, it's-it's kinda in a place that's not... It's not visually accessible to me, and I was hoping maybe you guys could-could help me out.
Laugh all you want but uh, she actually left me a message saying she'd like to go out again.
You like it?
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What's with the tackling?
No, I tried that. She says it has a weird smell.
Yeah.
OK, now I'm nervous.
Anyway, she thought the very idea of me playing rugby with him was like hilarious. So I'm gonna show her how tough I really am!
No.
Here you go.
Now that's a little spoiled. He was supposed to type "little", the idiot.
Hey! Okay! I got my passport, fresh socks, and a snake bite kit!
We're not done.
Yes, yes it is. In prison! Whatsa matter with you?
No, why?
Eh? We'll show him!
Like uh y'know like this! This! She-she could've made this!
What?
No! Pick me! I don't want to end up an old maid!
No!
He is saving your butt, ah, unless of course I'm stepping on some toes here, in which case I can just mosey on, I've got plenty of people to help on the Interstate.
Uh, excuse me. Evolution is not for you to buy, Phoebe. Evolution is scientific fact, like, like, like the air we breathe, like gravity.
Yeah.
In this life, Phoebe.
Yeah, yeah.
Before I forget, are we hitting faces?
Hi Whitney.
Look, you guys I just wanna say, I really, really appreciate you spending this time with me. It's been a pretty hard time right now, so I just wanna say thanks.
I think he can be.
Okay, I...
Okay, Jasmine, please, please don't. I love my girlfriend very much, and I want more than anything to just work it out with her. Okay?
Well I'm jumping! I have a son! Okay? He won't have a father if-if I die!
Okay, all right, I'll take you. I'll go call Joan.
Turns out them Emily is just crazy about Susan. Yeah, they're going to the theatre together! They're going to dinner! They're going horseback riding!
I'm calling Mom.
Well isn't there something you can do to earn a little extra money? I mean, can't-can't you pick up, I don't know, an extra shift here?
Good.
Yep.
No, no, I mean, I mean a thing on my body.
Monica, if you want, I can lend you some money.
Well, hello Rachel!
Doesn't sound as crazy as paying a thousand dollars for a cat.
Well, I said-I said something to Phoebe.
Okay, you wanna play rough, we can play rough.
I think when someone steals your credit card, they've kind of already thrown caution to the wind.
No, no, she's great and it's not like we haven't done anything. I mean, uh, uh, we, we do plenty of other stuff, lot's of other stuff, like uhh. . .
Fine.
Well w-w-w-w-wait, w-wait, wait, wait a minute! I mean a couple of stupid boxes get wet and she gets a Porsche?!
Come on! Like I wanted him to tell you, I ran all over the place trying to make sure that didn't happen!
Let go! Let go!
Oh, sorry we didn't know.
Eh?
Oh. Uh, by the way, if it makes you feel any better. I happen to like 8-year-old boys.
Monica you really think I should try this phasing out thing?
No-no, it's not that, it's just... I-I just moved in.
Technically, huh, no.
Good for you.
Oh hey, hey Mark.
Yeah.
Uh, no, no, see, because not...not all guys are going to be a Paolo.
Ok.
Yeah!
And if I remember correctly, Ray Ban was the official sponsor of World War I!
Uh, so this play umm, what do you think? It's-it's gotten great reviews! Y'know the uh...
Yeah, well missy, you better be glad that list is laminated.
Hey.
Ah....
Hi!
What?
Of course, of course, Mr. Stevens.
Ok, um, uh, more clothes in the dryer? I'm fine, I'm fine.
Uh, well, don't worry, I'll use the gentle cycle. Ok, um, basically you wanna use one machine for all your whites, a whole nother machine for colors, and a third for your uh, your uh, delicates, and that would be your bras and your under-panty things.
You ate my sandwich?
Hey!
Yeah!
Okay, it's second down. Take all the second downs you need.
It makes him miss the bowl, but whatever.
Well, I just spoke to Carol. Ben's got the chicken pox.
Well, they're not mine!
Okay.
Ohh! Thank you.
Nono, that would be me again.
Dear Mary-Angela. Hi. How's it going. This is the hardest letter I've ever had to write. What the hell's a matter with you? How do you think Joey's going to react when he finds out that you blew off his sister with a letter?
Doctor Burke is sexy?
Let me see, I gotta see, I gotta see. Oh, a head. Oh, it's, it's huge. Carol, how are you doing this?
Umm... Wow! That's-that's some pricey nut!
Yeah? Well, I-I think Ben's asleep.
Hey! What's she doing back here?
You complete me kitchen, matey!
Hi! Hi! Hi. Has umm, anyone seen Chandler?
No look I wasn''t right, that's what I came here to tell you. I was totally hung up on, on my own stuff. Listen, I'm someone who needs the whole security thing, ya know. To know exactly where my next paycheck is coming from buy you, you don't need that and that's amazing to me. I could never do what you do Joey.
Hey now! That was an accident, okay.
I got it at Pottery Barn!! Okay?!
Y'know, you're right. Thank you.
..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he-
Pshhshhh!
We're still married! Don't tell Rachel. See you later.
Oh just say it Kyle!
I'd like to return this couch. I'm not satisfied with it.
Okay, well, we'll call the company that sent her!
I whitened them.
No! No! Of course it didn't mean anything! I mean, uh well, I can understand why Emily would think it meant something, y'know, because-because it was you...
Happy for you.
Hey, I can handle it! All right?
Why?! Why on the lips?!
...What shoe?
No, y'know what, I guess it's partially my fault. Y'know, I shouldn't've, uh, asked you to start off with a monkey. I should've started you off with like a pen or a pencil.
Ross, uh and uh, I'd just like to say that it did take a lot of courage for Rachel to come here tonight. And, uh, for the record she did not run out on Barry because she had syphilis. What are you doing I'm serious. Uh, the reason she walked out on, on Barry is simply that she didn't love him, which incidentally worked out pretty well for me Cheers.
Joey-
Hey.
It was...This disagreement over... My god. You...you look beautiful.
Umm, she kissed me.
Four percent. Okay. I tip more than that when there's a bug in my food.
Yeah. Op! Uh-oh! I think your Dad must've added wrong. He only tipped like four percent.
Spring vacation.
It's all right.
Uhh, it was okay. Yeah, it was fun.
What?
Yeah, huh.
OK, turn around. I just don't want you staring at me when I'm doing this.
I would never do that!
I-I had to show Chandler something?
Remember when sometimes he'd borrow your hat, and, and when you got it back there'd be little monkey raisins in it.
And while that was good advice, you should know that what-what she wants...
Yeah? How'd it go?
Touched. Used. Sat on. Sleep on.
And here's little Ben nodding off...
Huh?
Excuse me, your, your, your wind?
She's your cousin. She's your cousin! If she knew what was going on in your head she'd think you were sick! Or would she? Let's back up a second. She was the one who suggested opening a bottle of wine. She was the one who turned down the lights. She was the one that wanted to rent Logan's Run, the sexiest movie ever. Oh, I know that look. Forget it. I want it. She wants it. I'm going in.
How was I supposed to know we'd end up being friends after college, let alone you-you would be living with my sister?
Come on you guys, it's no big deal!
Okay.
So I told Carl, 'Nobody, no matter how famous their parents are, nobody is allowed to climb on the dinosaur.' But of course this went in one ear and out.....
Thank you for teaching me a valuable lesson.
Yeah, but-but he didn't know that!
I know.
And so what if I like to go home, throw on some Kenny G, and take a bath!
Hey!
I can't believe you let George Michael slap you.
Is that-are you saying yes? Is that yes?
Wait, wait, wait.
Em-Emily? Em-Emily? Emily!
Oh, why don't you make her one of your little jokes.
DANGER!!! DANGER!!!!!
Hey, when the snippy guy sees the routine, he'll wanna build us our own platform!
Yeah?
Hi.
Yeah!
I'm gonna be on TV!!
Besides, there's a big age difference.
So, this must be kinda neat for ya, huh? I mean, your Dad tells me that you get a couple of days off school, and you, you ah, don't have to sell those cookies anymore.
Exactly. So you didn't, didn't mention anything to Issac right?
Oh come on, we just had this huge fight, all right, don't I have to wait a while?
Go over there and tell that woman the truth.
Oh God, no.
What the hell are you doing? You scared the crap outta me.
I don't think tho.
How come? Everybody else does.
Dysprosium? Try mendelevium.
Hey.
No, 10 is the highest.
Hey I'm sorry to do this to you again but uh, is there any way you can look after Ben for a little bit? I-I've got this meeting at school. And-and he-he asked for his uh, 'Fun Aunt' Rachel, so...
Well I guess you can start by drivin a cab on Another World.
Nah, I dunno... I think you reach a certain age, having a roommate is kinda pathe- ....sorry, that's, that's 'pathet', which is Sanskrit for 'really cool way to live'.
Okay, I'll be up in, 18 pages. Front and back. Very exciting.
Oh.. you don't get it!
Okay, please-please Paul, just let me explain...
No.
What?
Hiiii-Ya!! I'm serious! You're not walking out on my sister!
Okay, okay. Enough, enough with the lunging. No! I'm sick of this. Okay. I've had it up to here with you two! Neither you can come to the party!
Oh, it's-it's Marcel. He keeps shutting me out, y'know? He's walking around all the time dragging his hands...
So?
Ohh! Ohh! In college, Chandler got drunk and slept with the lady who cleaned our dorm!
Oh, where are you guys going?
Ah, the lesser-known "I don't have a dream" speech.
All right, try pedaling.
Yes, you can, very much.
Must pee.
Hmm-Hmm.
I guess when you don't have so many distractions, it's easier for you to focus. Huh?
Diverse.
There's this kid in my class who said he's in love with me.
Wow!
Flip me for it? No, no, no... heads, heads, heads!
Hi, we're visitiing. It's Ben and his da-da. Da-da. Can you say da-da? Look, I'm gonna tell your momies you said it anyway so you might as well try.
Oh my God, you guys!!
Wha, heh, how could you know, I don't even know!
Oh! ...Yeah, they were gross. Oh, you know what I loved? Her Sweet 'n' Los. How she was always stealing them from- from restaurants.
Uberveiss. It's new, it's German, it's extra-tough.
What-why?
I.....got.....dressed. Really, really quickly. Okay, okay. There we go, there we go.
Eh-wh-Excuse me?
You, you know I, I don't, have a- have a problem with that.
It's an empty apartment.
That is a great idea! And! I know Ugly Naked Guy because we've been watching him for like five years so that gives me back my edge! Oh, let's see now he had the trampoline.
Oh.
Yeah.
What?! What? How do you, how do you even know its broken?!
Ben! I mean, Ben! Ben!
Well, it turns out that she is going to Daytona for spring break woo-hoo. That means, that means wet T-shirt contests, guys doing shots off of girl's bodies, waking up next to people you don't even know...
No, you, ya know there's no need to make it u. . . how?
You know the song! Sing along!
Really.
Like 'em, like 'em? Or, I'd like to get store credit for that amount like 'em?
You're kidding.
Thanks a lot.
This is a girl that I really like and had too swoop in there!
Peach pit. That night we, uh- we had-
Hello? No she can't come to the phone right now. Oh, right no problem. Okay, bye-bye.
Eh, 'cause I knew that if I told you, you'd make me go, and I knew you needed someone to be with you tonight. Come on. Come on.
What?
Nothing. Oh, actually, great news! I just got off the phone with Emily and it looks like I'm moving to a new apartment. Woo-hoo!
And, I love you!!
What? You forgot fourteen states?
Bye sweetie.
I knew all I had to do was let the material speak for itself. Everyone's all, "Ross you have to be funny and sexy." Well, I proved them wrong! And now, I'm gonna pass the news onto Joey and Chandler.
Excellent, that was excellent.
Oh, now, don't listen to him, Pheebs, I think it's endearing.
It was soo not an accident. She saw I was about to tag her, so she threw her big fat grandma arm elbow right into my face. And just keep running.
You can't do that!
This is so cool. You're actually gonna be on television.
Maybe I should open a divorced men's club.
Hey everyone!
Got me.
No. But... it only has to happen once. Look, you and I both know we are perfect for each other, right? I mean... so, the only question is... are you attracted to me?
Oh. Listen, do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerability become any kind of a factor here- but do you think it would be okay if I asked you out? Sometime? Maybe?
Oh, thanks Gunther. STUPID BRITISH SNACK FOOD!!!!!!!
All right Emily, as much as I love you, I'm sorry, I can't move to London without Ben.
Maybe he's just jumping on a pogo-stick and really likes it?
God no!
Really?
What?!
Yeah alright.
Burt!
What?
Y'know what? She'd-she'd love this. Uh, it's an exact replica of Apollo 8. I made it in the sixth grade.
Yeah, maybe.
Oh, I've got to go pick up Ben, we've got a play date this afternoon.
Okay, there's this guy, Warren, from the museum and he's going on a dig for like two years and he's got this great place he needs to sublet. So uh, you interested?
Oh hey, that was a good one, huh? Help! Help!
I'm telling you, she said she's looking for a relationship with someone exactly like me.
Wha... what, here?
Phoebe!
W-What was the one right before bananas?
Well, excuse her for knowing what she wants to do with her life!
Yeah!
Why? Why would I why? Why? Why? Why?
I'm-I'm Ross by the way.
Yes. Yes. Don't worry. Everything's fine. We'll uh, we'll see you tomorrow at the wedding.
Look, that has nothing to do with this, ok? She's my ex-wife. If she were marrying a guy, none of you'd expect me to be there.
Yeah, all right, it's a date.
Well, I-I want to give her another chance, y'know? She lives so close. And, at the end of the date, the other time, she-she said something that was-if she was kidding was very funny. On the other hand, if she wasn't kidding, she's not fun, she's stupid, and kind of a racist.
Hey, someone order a coat?
Emily, there is nothing between Rachel and me. Okay? I love you.
What?
Well, where do I start? This is Julie. Julie, this is Rachel.
Well I, I don't know. Why?
Well, that's cool. So did...
Why don't we just put 'poor little Tooty' out in the hall?
I'm going to the bathroom.
Anyway, suddenly I'm down field, and I realise that I'm the one who's supposed to catch him, right? Only I know there is no way I'm gonna get there in time, so I am running, and running, and that, that is when I woke up. See I, I am so not ready to be a father.
No. No. No, I'm-I'm glad you did. Look, if nothing else, it's-it's always great when someone tells you they love you.
Ok, ok, here is to my sister, the newly-appointed head lunch chef--
Hey, what are you guys, what are you guys talking about?
Phoebe.
Thanks.
It didn't.
It's called the Bapstein-King comet, okay? Hey! Hey! Bapstein was a very well respected astronomer!
And why wouldn't he get it?
Okay, Elizabeth Hurely....
Yeah. You see my-my sister makes these amazing turkey sandwiches. Her secret is, she puts a, an extra slice of gravy soaked bread in the middle; I call it the Moist Maker. Anyway, I-I put my sandwich in the fridge over here...
It's winter, they are fewer people on the street.
So Joey umm, you look familiar. Are uh, are you on TV or something?
Why are we in bed together?
Hey Mon!
It hurts my teeth.
How rude.
Anyway it-it kinda-it all boils down to this, the last time I talked to Emily...
Whatever dude, you kissed a guy.
Shoot.
Oh no, no, no, wait, wait, Isabella. Don't, don't just dismiss this so fast. I mean this is a once in a lifetime opportunity...
This is Ross?
No-no-no-no-no.
Look, I don't care it starts at eight, we can't be late.
No. I am not putting on makeup.
Uh, hello!
You got me a cola drink?
Monica?
Oh my God! That's Rachel naked! I can't look at that! I am looking at this. Okay, vivid colors, expressive brush strokes-Unless she wants me to be looking at that. She knows I'm home. She knows I can see her. What kind of game is she playing? I think maybe someone's lonely tonight. Oh-ho, Dr. Geller! Stop it! You're being silly! Or, am I?
Hey, come on in.
Well, I'm not going to go now anyway .
Hey guys.
Hey, I am not unemployed. I'm on sabbatical!
Oh.
Me either...
So, Phoebs owes $7.50, Monica, you owe $10, and Rachel, you owe fifteen big ones.
I was doing great with Julie before I found out about you.
Look, I'm sorry, I thought it looked pretty.
Then where the hell have you been?!
Number six: the way you smell.
Yeah! I don't know. I mean, last year Elizabeth now-now this kid. What-what-what-what is it?! Am I giving out some kind of...sexy professor vibe?
Look, I don't think so Pheebs. All right, I'll do it. But just because you're a friend.
Okay.
That is what the thing is.
Y'know-thanks!
That's not what this is about okay? I-I am a sports car enthusiast. I have always been into cars.
Hey Rach.
To London! Come to London. Please? It'll mean so much to me.
I was having a little chat with ah, Bonnie, and ah, guess what, she-she happened to bring up y'know, who was behind the um, whole head shaving idea, and now, who was it? Oh, that's right, that's right, it was you!
I am, uh, I am...
Mr. Dickens gets to pick 'em.
We had such a great time! She's-she's incredible! I thought the-the age difference might be a problem, but it wasn't. It wasn't at all. Elizabeth is very mature for her age. A concept lost on some people!
I'm gonna have to give him up.
Yeah, I really do. Yeah, but what am I gonna do, I mean we-we both agreed that it was gonna be a two-week thing, y'know no commitment.
May I come in?
Yeah, um, okay see, you were, you were on the list but my friend, Chandler brought up the very good point that you are international, so I bumped you for Wynona Rider, local.
No really, I mean, I mean, God, I could use a friend.
Hey are you getting Monica and Chandler an engagement present?
You should get some sleep.
Ok, do you have any ideas for any openers?
There's no 'or' in mind. What is wrong with these pants?!!
Hi.
Well for starters, you may want to light it and lose the spatula.
No, no, no, this weekend guys!
Oh yeah! Wasn't she uh...
I've gotta go, there's a deer just outside eating fruit from the orchard!
Nu-uh!
Uh, oh-ho bye.
Are we really in Montreal?!
Yeah.
Umm?
Le Poo's still alive?!
...nauseous, I'm physically nauseous. What am I supposed to do, huh? Call immigration? I could call immigration!
So how'd it go?
Come on. These people'll scooch down. You guys'll scooch, won't you? Let's try scooching! Come on. Come on. Uh, Kristen Riggs, this is Carol Willick. Carol, Kristin. Uh, Carol teaches sixth grade. And, Kristin, Kristin... ...does something that, funnily enough, wasn't even her major!
Emily that's ridiculous. Look, I'm-I'm moving for you, I'm cutting friends out of my life for you. Please, just get on the plane and come to New York. Okay, you'll see you're the only person I want to be with.
Look, look, look.
My first time with Carol was...
I think I have an old band uniform from high school.
Pretty soon I guess.
Okay. Um, how about these?
I'm still hungry!
What? What? What?!
Do you uh, do you talk about me?
Okay, it's not, it's not.
Oh, I was unbelievable.
Why aren't you guys dressed?
Yeah. Yeah, oh you loved that thing. You always had it with you. You never went anywhere without-without that coloring book.
And! Break!!
Oh, Emily that is, that is so great. It's gonna be so great! We're gonna be like-like-like two idiots in love!
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What makes you think we're gonna break up?
Wh- are you welling up?
Hey! So, uhh, Amanda just-just dropped me off. Yeah, that's one of the things I love about her, she's...uh, she's old enough to drive. So uhh, I guess you're not going to mom and dad's tonight?
Right. I guess, I guess I should call Emily.
No one got me an engagement present.
Y'know what? I'm good! I'm good!
What?
No! You let go!
And the reason I'm doing this is because I am Joey's friend. And if you were a good friend, you'd be doing the same thing.
Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, that glacier's getting kinda close.' See?
Wh-haa-haa! Look what 'cha did!
I didn't get a cat.
Hey! Oh, we-we can't keep eating like this.
Save the breakthroughs for therapy, okay. The clock is ticking. We have no time, and we are losing, we are losing to girls.
Why?
What is Monica's biggest pet peeve?
Marcel! Marcel! Marcel, no! Good boy. See, how can nobody want him?
That's what you said last night.
Look who I found standing outside of the Szechwan Dragon staring at a parking meter.
Celia, don't worry! Don't scream! He's not going to hurt you! Soothing tones, Celia. Soothing tones! Marcel...
Dad, dad, dad, I'm talkin' about the whole uh, baby thing. Did you uh, ever get this sort of... panicky, "Oh my god I'm gonna be a father" kind of a thing?
HEY, SHE'S FAST!! OKAY?!! Oh! You-you think you can be beat me? Let's go! Outside!!
Look, I do not re-love her.
Hey does anyone have any gum?
The Armadillo was actually not so thrilled about that part! Okay Ben, it's time to light the Hanukkah candles!
She, she was different.
No. So what. So what if we get beaten up, maybe that's just something every man has to go through once in his life. Ya know, like a, like a right of passage or somethin'.
A little? Your place looks like page 72 of the catalogue. Oh look at that! The ornamental bird cage! Large!
Yeah, but not very well, unless 14-across, 'Gershwin musical' actually is bitemebitemebitemebiteme.
Is there somebody else?
Move in with me.
I'm the holiday armadillo! I'm a friend of Santa's and he sent me here to wish you a Merry Christmas!
Are you out of your mind?
Hey!
Yowzah!!!
I wonder how I would react under fire, y'know? And not backfire but-but heavy fire, like I was in a war or something.
I'm getting married today!! Ahh, whoo-hoo!!
We were drunk! I would've married uh, Joey with that amount of alcohol!
Well, I don't know.... huh-huh.... but I'm hoping huh-huh.
Hello!
Yes, very nice Rachel.
Yeah, definitely, I'm sure you'll feel totally different when it's our baby.
You all right?
Oh, yeah, why not?
Well, yeah, kinda. Um, but that's okay, see we have an understanding, um, see we each have this list of five famous people, so I'm allowed to sleep with you. No, no, no, it's flattery.
Awww.
Fine. I just need to know that you're not gonna tell your sister.
Uh, okay, yeah, we could do that, but before we head off to the murder capital of the North-East, I was, uh, kinda wanting to run something by you. Y'know how we were, uh, y'know, talking before about, uh, relationships and stuff? Well-
Uh, never mind, I don't want to know.
Oh God, thank you! Umm, uh, Mr. Stevens I'd like you to meet my friends uh, this is Phoebe, Monica, and Chandler.
You're kid's name is Raymond!
Uh, hello dad! Monica and I just saw the house in the paper! Yes we're surprised! Who did you leave a message with?
I know! I'm saying you have to watch them all the time.
Tag? Y-You're going? Uh we didn't, uh we didn't get the chance to talk. Uh, so, where did you say you're from again?
Kiwi? Kiwi? I thought it was a key lime pie.
What, what is it?
Hey, what are you doing shopping at eight in the morning?
What?
Can I come over tomorrow and pick up Fluffy Meowington's cat toy.
Oh, Rachel, I'm-I'm sorry.
There you go. You put on a tuxedo! Now that wasn't so scary, was it?
Oh yeah, she's-she's amazing. And-and she's so much fun. And! Y'know what? When I'm with her, I'm fun! I even signed up for helicopter classes. She's leaving in two days, I don't have to do it.
No, I missed and hit the door. But, it opened really hard!
Look, I'm sorry.
You still on that?
Well, what-what would you do? Rach, if you were me, what-what would you do?
Ok, Phoebe, this is it. In this briefcase I carry actual scientific facts. A briefcase of facts, if you will. Some of these fossils are over 200 million years old.
Yeah, I was going for the metaphor.
Oh wow, yeah! See, I did not get that.
Ohh.
Sexy?
Nooo!
Look I've already looked at like a thousand apartments this month and none of them even compares to that one!
I know.
Hey! It's 42-21!
Are you kidding? Okay, look. I-I studied evolution. Remember, evolution? Monkey into man? Plus, I'm a doctor, and I had a monkey. I'm Doctor Monkey!
Yeah, see, I don't think it's gonna that difficult considering this one won't be taking place in the basement of a Pizza Hut.
Guys? There's a somebody I'd like you to meet.
I uh, I don't know, I guess I'm just gonna see, see what happens.
Oh yeah it will! Come on, up! Up-up-up! Up! Yes! Here we go! Pivot! Pivot! Piv-ot! Piv-et!! Piv-ett!!! Piv-et!
I'm fine. Just-just... having my worst fear realised...
You had fantasies about Emily?
Oh, thank God!
No.
Oh-no. No. No.
Ohio!! Thank you!
Well, the doctor says he's gonna be fine, he's just sleeping now.
Oh, I promise, what.
Yeah, anything goes, except ah, eye gouging and fish hooking.
You told her!
Hey, you're not going to believe this. I made up a joke and sent it in to Playboy. They printed it!
No-no. It's-it's me, Ross!
Well, John McLane had plans!
Okay, you go grab it!
Thank you.
God, I don't believe this. She could be giving birth in the cab.
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
Hi.
What? Come on Rach, tell me what you're thinking?
No! And I'm not gonna be, so you can save you little speech.
'Cause I know what you're trying to pull here. Okay? It's not gonna work.
Yeah!!
Ooh, ooh. Because she's my ex-wife, and will probably want to bring her, ooh, ooh, lesbian life partner.
Who wants to make some long distance calls?
Stop saying, "Blood" to strangers.
Hey.
Are you sure? Great. Carol? Wanna come over and join us?
I- I think they're great! I, I really do.
Yeah, I uh, totally forgot about that. You mind if I take a rain check? I'm waiting for a call from Emily.
C'mon.
How can you not believe in evolution?
Okay! All right! Now, Chandler you-you wanna live with Monica, right?
Two seconds...
Mm-Hmm.
So they ah, they all took off, it was pretty hard watching them go, y'know?
Yeah, you didn't get one.
Okay, I've got three of my five.
Oh, no, no, no, it's-it's not the lecture ah, I mind, umm....
You're good.
So, for the whole weekend?
Wait-wait, so, you get to be my best man twice and I never get to be yours at all?
Hey!
Oh, thank you. Hey, hey. Rachel!!!!
I know, it's crazy! We were just pushing Ben on the swings...
No! No! Wh... What are you doing?!! GET OFF MY SISTER!!!!!!!!!!!!!
What do you mean, they're not moving in? They-they're still moving in right?
Stay away!
Sure, your dresser is missing but this she notices.
You wanna explain that?
Rach!
It'll be okay Joe.
Alright, alright, ok. Bye.
I don't believe this. I miss, I miss the first time of everything. I missed, what, the first time he rolled over, the first time he crawled. What else did I miss? Has he spoken yet, is he driving, does he have a favorite liquour?
No-no it's not. What-what happened there Ned?
Hi.
'That' would be Marcel. You wanna say hi?
I don't know, I mean you were a lot bigger, I mean, stronger back then.
No, why?
