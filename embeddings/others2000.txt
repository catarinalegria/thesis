Hey, Monica!
G'night.
Yeah that would be great! Let me make sure I'm not doing anything Tuesday.
Hey, buddy! Are you familiar with Section 11-B of the Health Code that requires all refuse material out the back exit?
Wait! Where's my shoes?
No me, I am so sorry...
Wait a minute, hold it. Johnson! Will you come in here a moment?
This is the last call for Flight 1066 to Athens. The last call.
You don't think I'm cute?
Ross, there's one thing that really scares me still.
Yeah, drop it! Drop the towel! Please drop the wowww.
Here's the thing.
Great!
Oh please God, let there be a song.
I'm going to look into your eyes now.
Can you really do that?
Hey Joey. Hi. Hey, buddy.
Ow!
I'll get our seats.
Okay.
Wait! We need shoes!
How did you get here so fast, I just saw you in Salem?
Good. Bye!
No, no!
You see, that's why I did so bad on this test. I'm having a hard time concentrating. When you're up there and you're teaching and your face gets all serious...you look so good. You wear that tight little turtleneck sweater...
Oh wow! That was amazing, was that really just an hour?!
I think we're here.
I like Ross.
Go ahead. Try a piece. Yeah, we think that Mockolate is even better than chocolate.
Don't do this to me, again. You'd know I'd stay here in a minute, but I'd really miss so much work, they'll fire me.
What's the matter? Are you upset?
Hi
Ok, that's ok. I'm fine. I'm... oh!
We're beginning to see a lot of layering of sheer fabrics and colours. For instance a sheer navy blouse over a pink....
Our next item is the romantic trip to Paris. It goes to Emil Alexander high a high bid of 2,300.
It's probably because not mature enough. Or smart enough. Maybe he doesn't like the way I dress-No that can't be it. It's really gotta be the smart thing. Oh I'm so stupid! I'm just like this incredibly pretty stupid girl!
Here comes the beep, you know what to do.
Well,... thanks.
I guess.
You know, in some cultures having a third nipple is actually a sign of virility. You get the best huts and women dance naked around you.
Ross!
...I may have only been in therapy for three weeks now dear but...
Twenty year old has got a severed toe on his right foot.
Diet Coke.
You need these books.
Yeah Ross it's okay, it's me, Mr. Stevens.
Scene 5, take 2.
Oh no, it isn't! No! I think Barry is seeing someone in the city.
Somebody called about a monkey?
You were amazing out there.
Mom, we've been through this. No, I'm not calling him. I don't care if it is his kid, the guy's a jerk. No, I'm not alone. Joey's here. What do you mean, Joey who? Joey who?
No.
Oh my God. I think you're right.
Hi Kim.
Good-bye! Good luck!
Can't you see what's going on here, this man is dying.
Rough numbers?
You know, Junior Miss is where I started. Oh, I had to sleep with the ugliest guy to get that job.
Yeah.
What was all that about?
Yeah, that's pretty much what I had in mind.
I know, it's horrible isn't it?
Oh, Ross? Ross! You can't put up flyers in here.
No you stop!
Buffay, are you going to plunge your stake into my dark places?
Right. He's not angry at the room either. Try it again, he owns it! He owns the room. It is his. He owns, owns, owns, owns the room! He owns it!! All right, it's a little weird, but it's getting better. Oh well, I'm gonna miss this woman so much. I don't know what I'm going to do! I mean, it's been 20 years of my life.
So anyway we really... Honey, we're just smoking all over you.
What?
I'm sorry it didn't work out between you and me, or you and me. Drew was very disappointed.
You?
I know I haven't worked in an office before, and I really don't have a lot of experience, but uh...
So you wanna get some dinner?
Hey pal, are you Joey Tribbiani?
Oh my God.
Oh, Net Usage Statistics, right. Gotcha, gotcha. Wont happen again. I wouldnt want to do anything to hurt your... "wenus."
I have a wonderful idea. You should take Rachel to the prom.
How do you know Frank?
Thanks.
She's checking the coats. Joey, I'm gonna go wash the cab smell off my hands. Will you get me a white Zinfandel, and a glass of red for Janice.
I, Emily...
Good luck, babe.
Bye! See you later!
How's the hired help?
Sooo!! Anyway...
Hi!
Get out!
See what you did.
...No. I think some things are better left unsaid. I think it's nicer when people just get along.
We can't scratch. You know we can't, we'll scar.
Well, if you're one of Ross's best friends, why aren't you here?
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Awww!
That's my monkey.
Apparently Howie's editing now. Yeah, he-he-he calls me up and asks me if he can edit my new movie. Can you believe that?! Y'know I-I-I haven't spoken to him in like ten years and he asks me for a favor!
Me? I'm fine, fine. I'm glad you're here. ...What's with your hair?
You-you have a very beautiful... eye.
Whats she doing here?
Morning.
Hey.
Oh no-no-no-no, being adored. I'm used to it, don't worry about it.
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, I think I forgot my receipt.
How are you? Look, you guys wanna meet the group? Come on. So, are you one of the ones who fooled around with my dad?
Well, we kissed. I-I-I didn't initiate the kiss, but-but I also didn't stop it, and I've been feeling guilty.
Well, it was great seeing you the other night.
We met with him. Did he show you the photos of the nude wedding he did?
Aaawwwwww!!
Right, okay, then no.
Yeah, I'm riding the alimony pony.
Well, I suppose I could give him a warning.
Yo, Chloe, do you have a quarter for the condom machine?
Oh no! But I just walked past three sales and I didn't go in. How strong am I?
No, don't say it.
He's... new.
98 hot saves, highest in the force.
For Chandler!
Oh, you're losin' your apron here, let me get it. There you go.
The pizza-place across the street any good?
That's okay.
Yeah! You're saying, you need to be with someone more mature. Maybe someone with, a license to practice medicine. Or a mustache.
Dr. Richard Burke is out of town. Dr. Timothy Burke, his son, will see you now.
I, I don't know.
Oh my God!
I'm sorry.
Sure.
Hey, y'know I was thinking, what are the odds like if-if, if you stuff like 200 of them in there?
You-you work at one of those massage parlors?
-hard quality. And uh, while Daryl Hannah is beautiful in a conventional way, you are luminous with a kind of a delicate grace. Then, uh, that-that-that's when you started yelling.
Well, if you see him, tell him to pack his bags. We are going to Minsk.
Not her.
Take thee, Emily...
Yeah, refrigerator college.
Surprise.
Hey!
That's it, feel the rhythm. That's better.
I don't like looking foolish. Y'know what? Maybe uh, I don't arrest you today. Maybe I came by and you weren't here.
Uh-huh. Is it dirty?
I know. OK, I wasn't completely honest with you when I told you that, uh, I didn't know exactly where he lived.
What?!
What? He's cute!
Oh. Oh-oh-okay, I get it.
No.
I miss you already!!
So you still in touch with anyone from high school?
Yeah! Punch him!!
You've got panties stuck to your leg.
You hopped a little bit. Yeah, I really sorry.
What'd you do, dip it in sugar?
Ohh.
Alright, let's take this outside.
Professor Geller!
Goodbye.
How are you?
Y'know what?
Hi guys. I haven't seen you since this morning.
No no no!
Really? Well, in that case...
Ross, I love you!
Monica, why have you brought me here of all places?!
Yeah! Yeah, sort of. I'm sorry.
Stay well.
I now find you shallow and um, a dork. All right, bye.
I'm telling you, it's a wonder your mother turned out to be the positive, life-affirming person that she is.
Yep.
Are you going to eat that bread?
Oh, sure, yeah. This is the one of you father in a meadow, and, uh, helping a little boy fly a kite, and here he is at a graduation. . . another graduation. . . another graduation.
I was just being polite, but, alright.
You know, my brother and his boyfriend have been trying to adopt for three years. What agency did you two go through?
No-no-no, no. I'm going to talk. I believe that the sun has set on our day in the sun.
Hey!
Hey!
Oh Rachel, uhh...
Are you okay? What's wrong?
3! 2! 1! HAPPY NEW YEAR!!
Oh, it's good news. No, it's definitely good news. Hold on a second, I have another call. Hey, how's it going?
What?! What would make you think that?
Listen guys, it was great seeing you again. Mon, um, easy on those cookies, okay? Remember, they're just food, they're not love.
Oh, yeah, my firm represents the band.
Aaaahhhhhhh.
Uh, they're not in it.
OK, I'll just sit here and... uh... chat with your, uh.... friend-type....people.
I don't know.
Well, it was quite large. I-I-I-I-I had to throw most of it away.
Hi!
Oh! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Yes! Thank you!
Oh my God! What's wrong with your baby?!
Oh. Well uh, you not being able to talk may make this easier. Listen umm... Listen I don't wanna be someone who comes between two best friends. I just, I can't stand seeing what this is doing to you guys, and I don't wanna be the cause of that. So, I don't think we can see each other anymore. I'm gonna go to my mom's in Chicago, I'm gonna stay there for awhile. I think this could've be something really amazing, but y'know this is probably for the best. Y'know? I'm gonna miss you. Good-bye, Chandler.
Oh my God! It didn't remind you of...
You, you want, you want me to move out?
Why don't we what?
Thats unbelievable.
Ahh, nooo!!
Ohh! Didn't know! Okay!
What's the matter?
I want you to move in with me.
Yeah!
Yes!
Ok, you really want me out?
So, I'll call you tomorrow.
Your license please.
Yeah, you can melt art. Hey, can I use your phone?
Yep. I'm gonna wear these on our date tonight.
You're kidding. Oh my God.
I don't see it. You are dancing with the tall guy over there. Tall guy, raise your hand!
Hi.
We never get smacked.
Please, please take him too.
Hey!
Do you have the, the Ralph Lauren file?
Yeah, uh, Joey said I could use your shower, since, uh, Chandler's in ours?
How about a hammer, or a small blade?
There's nothing to wonder about, Monica. You're gonna go back to being exactly who you were, because that's who you are.
Get a shot of Monica. Where's Monica.
Yeah, thanks.
Friends. Family. We are gathered to celebrate here today the joyous union of Ross and Emily. Now Ross, repeat after me. I Ross...
Yay!!
Oh please, I memorized those numbers when I was 15. But look at all the cool make-it-on-my-own stuff I got! This is my "Please, hire me" sweater. And these are my, "Don't you want to rent me this apartment?" pants.
Uh, you guys see me as a dad?
He picked it out of the toy store himself, he loves it.
Not you. Relax. Ever have to fire anyone?
What?
I got a little drunk...and naked.
Oh my god, there's an unattractive nude man playing the cello.
Yeah, well, sure I touch them, but I spent years learning not to squish them. That's my hand.
Hey, what kind of puppy do you think I should get?
Attack!
Acting! Chandler, this is my job! I'm-I'm playing a part in a play! How can you not trust me?!
Joey Tribbiani, this is...
Hello, Mr. Bing.
We may not have any weapons, but we still have food. In the basement I saw potatoes and some dry pasta, and a few tins of tuna!
All right.
Thank you, Max. Thank you.
You are gonna be fine, believe me.
Well, I've been calling you, but it turns out I had your number wrong. And when I finally got the right one from Information, there was no answer. So I thought I'd just come down here, and make sure you were okay.
Well, I was thinking, why doesn't he give Monica a call?
Five dollars a box.
...Now what is this about you-you being arrested i-in London? What is that all about?
Monica told you I was cuter that this, didn't she?
I did not!
Surprise!
That's all!
Remember the class play? You, you pulled up my skirt and the entire auditorium saw my underpants.
You were right.
Um, so listen, how many times am I gonna have to touch you on the arm before you ask me on a date.
Really?
Oh Drake.
I thought you knew I was looking at you.
Oh my God! It's like a fairyland.
Well. Your mom didn't tell us about the blobbies.
She's not here and please come in.
Oh, I'm gonna blow this one up, and I'm gonna write 'Reunited' in glitter.
Daddy!
Professor Geller?
Phoebe?
Hey, how do you guys get anything done?
Your loyal loving boyfriend Ross..... Ross!
I'm gonna try.
And tell him what?
Oh, yeah!
No, I'm picking you up.
Hey!
...has become the penicillin of the twenty-first century. And so today, this hospital is about to take major steps toward leading that revolution. It is truly ironic, on one hand consider the size...
No.
Makes me feel um, peaceful, heh-heh, please.
okay, but you have to admit that every time we go out... Women we meet at the hospital... It turns into...
Plate?
Fabulous.
So when do you imagine you gave them to me? In the morning or in the afternoon?
Here, we are.
Oh really, you guys tryin' again?
What?!
Thanks. You're, uh, you're a good kid.
Hi.
Shhh.
What's in the cup, Ross?
It's a nice watch, I don't wanna break it on your ribs.
Oh. They don't.
I'll remember that.
Yeah!
Okay. I'll be right back.
Judy, the kids..
I was just coming over here to apologize for my behavior! I'd really like it if we could be friends.
What do you see?
Not Sean Penn. Alright, I, I've got a funny one, alright. My last girlfriend Tilly. Ok, we're eating breakfast, right, and I made all these pancakes, there was like 50 pancakes right. And all of the sudden she turns to me, alright, and she says, 'Eddie.' I say, 'yeah,' she says, 'Eddie, I don't want to see you anymore.' And it was literally like she had reached into my chest, ripped out my heart, and smeared it all over my life, ya know. And now there's like this incredible abyss, ya know, and I'm falling and I keep falling and I don't think I'm ever gonna stop. That uh, wasn't such a funny story, was it?
No. No, you're not a loser.
Look, I just saw my best friends brains smeared across the canvas, that's not gonna be me, not me.
A test?!!
I miss you to. Well, at least I think I do.
Hmm.
Why doesn't my key work and what's all my stuff doin' downstairs?
This is a great place. How long have you lived here?
Excuse me. You should check this out, tell the other tenants. Apparently he's running around looking for some kind of a hot girl.
Is it dry in here?
'Despair fills the mattress showroom. My kingdom is suddenly without a queen. I'm so depressed I'm going to slash... my prices!! Check it out! Four ninety-nine for a pillow top queen set! I'm going medieval on prices!
I uh, I've been to his apartment and he wasn't there, and uh. I need to talk to him, so do you have any idea where he is?
Here you go.
Chandler Bing?
That's right. Mr. Ford is a very good customer, he brings us a lot of clothes; you bring us nothing!
Wait that's-that's, what that's not what you do?
Yeah. That's okay, right?
Yeah, that sounds about right.
What? Are you married? 'Cause that's okay.
That saves us a conversation.
Yes!!
Yeah! Right!
What?
Uh-oh, busted!
Get my glasses too.
I must tell you, you look beautiful tonight.
Yeah, all the time. I want the baby to know my voice.
Ok, and this is Funny Clown. Funny Clown is only for after his naps, not before his naps or he won't sleep.
COME ON!!!!
Hey man, check it out, I got some great stuff to dehydrate here. I got some grapes, got some apricots, I thought it would be really cool to see what happens with these water balloons.
Kidding! God, I feel wild today!
No, I don't know him.
Hello Tilly.
Could you pull open the curtains for me? The astronauts from the space shuttle are gonna be on the news, and since we don't have a TV, the lady across the alley said she'd push hers up to a window, so I could watch it.
No. No. No. Okay, now, see, I wanna name the girl baby Leslie, and Frank wants to name one of the boy babies Frank JR. JR.
So, okay! So you'll come with me on the Paris trip.
Oh no, I-I'm sorry, I guess we lost track of everybody after high school.
Can I get some ice here?!
No.
I'm getting my cigarettes out of my jacket.
I can promise not to tell her again.
I'll see you later, sweetie. Bye Joey.
Yes, Waltham interiors.
Oh, yeah. Had that dream.
This is Wayne, the man who created and operates C.H.E.E.S.E.
Here are the audition scenes.
No.
You wanna know why. You wanna know why?
I am famished. What do I want...
Phoebe, you don't have to say that.
Yes?
But, you're not identical twins.
No, no no no, you don't have to tell me anything. You don't have to explain yourself to me. Ooh, who am I to question the great Dr. Drake Remore?
Okay. Will you marry me?
Heavy.
So... We go eat.
He can have his job back.
Nancy and I were talking about the fall collection.
Oh, this is so good you have got to try it.
Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut..
Well, ever-ev-... ever since she left me, um, I haven't been able to, uh, perform. ...Sexually.
Yeah, I've been thinking ever since you said we were having triplets, the best thing for me to do is to drop out of college and get a job.
Rachel, I need the Versachi invoice. Hello! You don't work for me.
We're waiting for the candy. Bring out the candy!
I don't know, I mean, y'know, this is the city y'know, I just, I mean, I don't know.
Umm, no.
I know! And I'm just getting out of a marriage, I mean talk about meant to be!
Okay.
Anyway, hopefully, I'll see you around sometime.
Oh wow, Ray-ray I have no idea what you're talking about.
Okay.
Will you be my maid of honour?
You are an idiot. .
This is the final boarding call for Flight 009.
He carries it everywhere, it's like a security blanket, but with ski boots and a kicky beret.
Can't wait.
Working with blind kids.
Well, maybe I'll bring it out and have Monica stick her finger in it. That oughta sweeten it up, huh?
What did we just finish talking about Ben?!
Yeah! C'mon!
Yeah!
Hello darling.
Gloves. Brown, leather dress gloves.
Yep.
Ooh, steer clear of you.
Hey guys.
And you! I throw myself at you and you say no, how gay are you?
Thank you.
I know! Why don't you get drunk! That worked for a lot of girls in my high school.
Hey. Look, I'm sorry about yesterday, I, um-
Uh, I am, uh, to say good-bye.
I thought you wanted to adopt your cat.
Yeah? Listen closely, Devon has got a weak ankle.
But were fine.
Hey, I'm trying to have a private conversation! Is that okay?!
No, I hate cats.
Eight! Easy eight.
I think his butt would like to get this shot before lunch. Once again, rolling... water working... and action....and cut. What was that?
Look, you don't want to fight me.
Suddenly I'm seeing him go off to college.
Well, I don't know. I mean, it's conceivable that you wanted to sabotage your marriage so that the sibling would feel less of a failure in the eyes of the parents.
You know what, where he hugs you and kinda rolls you away and... Oh... my....God.
It's no big deal. Chandler was just kissin' me because he thought I was Mary-Angela.
I brought you something.
Sign here.
Okay, so wait, all right, so how does that make things better?
It doesn't say that in the script.
I think he's stoned again.
I'll feel better when I'm there, and I can know where you are all the time.
Hi, Dean Lipson, zoo administrator. I was told you had a question.
Oh no-no-no. Fonzie is the nickname of Arthur Fonzerelli. The Fonz.
OH...MY...GAWD!!!!
Everybody has to audition.
If that helps you.
Whenever you're ready.
What?!
Y'know what umm, actually I, I really, I should go.
Normally, I would not do it.
And when you have a second later, I wanna show you why we don't just trap spiders under coffee mugs and leave them there.
Huuh.
Uh-huh. G-good deal.
Are they, uh, firm?
No.
You're right.
I can dial 9-1-1 at the touch of a button, y'know. Now, go away!
Hey Joey, you wanted to talk to me?
Careful! They haven't quite taken yet.
Carol, Carol, sweetie. Cleansing breath.
My God! You love me!
I'm gettin' back together with my ex-girlfriend.
It was a simple mistake. It could happen to anyone.
Don't worry about it. It's not a problem.
Hey!
Eww!
Hey! Hello, babe! Wh what're what're you doing here?
Yeah, we'll see!
Oh, okay. Hey, two beers.
Now, let us try that again, shall we?
Yeah, you're funny.
Oh, I got that for him.
Give me a 'for instance'.
Breakfast is near!
Ohh. Hi!
Gotcha!!
Okay.
Hi!
Yeah, yeah, let me show you around. This is the uh, downstairs living room.
Hi. Uh, did I accidentally drop a condom in your case? It's kind of an emergency.
All right girls, and man. Let's see your final tallies. Ohhhh, Debbie, 321 boxes of cookies, Very nice.
Just ah...
Here you go.
Hi, I'm Joshua, I'm here to pick up Rachel.
Y'know it's ironic...
I see the head.
Yeah...
C'mon in.
Yeah! Hey, do Monica and Rachel work there?
It's just that I uh, have been working for ten years now at this meaningless, dead-end job and nobody here even knows I exist!
Does it have melted cheese and marinara sauce?
And if that person is already in your life, you should do something about it right?
Umm, it costs $16,000 each time you do this. So, umm, we're kinda using all the money we have to do it just this one time.
She's there?!
What?
Excuse me, I-I couldn't help overhearing, you're marrying Chandler Bing?
What's wrong?
Okay, but that would actually be a big step down for me.
Hi, Joey.
Oh?
Huh. Yeah?
I'm Scott.
God bless the chickpea.
No, it was. It was very very good.
Um, y'know, before we go ah, there's something I need to say.
I'm sorry, Joey, that is my chose.
So uh, you're not gonna be able to live here for a while, you ladies have a place to stay?
I can't speak for Emily, but Susan is in a loving, committed relationship.
Yeah, I-I'm taking pledges here, eh?
Oh God!
Maybe you should.
Before we go on with the show, I just want to say to the bride and groom how lucky they are to have found each other. In every life, a little rain must fall. Fortunately, in my life... It's raining men!
Hey, pal, you have about three seconds to get away from my partner.
Ross umm, there's something that I've got to tell you, there's-there's someone else.
How did you--?
Okay. You ready to push again?
Oh my God! Whoah!
Oh no, these dresses are all so amazing but there is no way I could afford one.
It's not Rick.
I am so attracted to him right now.
Thomas, this is gonna be hard, but I wanted it to come from me, and nobody else.
Bye-bye. Oh uh, by the way, the answer is, the Brazil nut.
We don't give anything away unless it's someone's birthday.
Please reattach this, it's against the law to disconnect them.
Hi honey, I've got a cab waiting.
All right. Bye.
When's your birthday?
Chandler?
Okay, well, my cell phone number is right here on the counter, please help yourself to anything in the fridge.
It was a simple mistake. It could happen to anyone.
Thanks. Maybe I'll see in the spring, with the uh, y'know, for the uh, bathing suits.
We could write it down for you?
Yes?
Really?!
Um, now. Phoebs.
What people?
Congratulations! You now just crossed the line into completely useless. Get out.
All right, he's crowning. Here he comes.
It's yours!
I gotta tell you, you look great now.
Yeah?
Don't worry, Hoshi taught me how to use an opponent's strength and weight against him.
Joey? Joey Tribbiani?
Kidney stones! Now, ordinarily Mr. Tribbiani, we try to break up the stones up with shock waves, but they're to close to the bladder now. Which means we can either wait for you to pass them or else go up the urethra...
I think I brought back half of the beach in my hair. It was so much easier when I used to shave my head.
What's up?
Hey, Joe.
He'll be here OK, take a chill pill.
No! Y'know what Rachel? You're right, y'know he has been really nice to me.
Is this guy, uhh, an old boyfriend?
Great. That would be fine.
That's great! That's wonderful!
All right, all right, there's a few too many people in this room, and there's about to be one more, so anybody who's not an ex-husband or a lesbian life partner, out you go!
Oh, my god, I am so glad you called me. I had the most supremely awful day.
Uh, your door isn't sound proof.
That's it. That's my whole name.
Ah! Nora Bing!
Well, my goodness, what was that?
Yeah?
No!
I don't understand, why didn't you help that man?
Lose the robe.
Hey Pheebs!
What?
Adios.
I'm supposed to meet and hug a fan whose dying, but that's not supposed to be until later!
Ah what?! Jessica hates horses!
Lecroix. Janine Lecroix
Alright. Let's talk reality for a second.
Good luck!
Well, maybe you and your baby should go to another strip club.
You know, I rarely connect with someone this much on the first date.
I think we'd better start again. Ross, repeat after me. I, Ross...
Nobody knows his name. Me and the girls just call him the Hombre man.
Uh, I'm a little embarrassed about calling you a hottie on my evaluation...
No-no-no, do you uh light candles? Burn incense?
I can't believe we go on in, in a week.
I'm sorry Chandler, y'know you are such a sweet guy and I, I don't want to hurt you. Oh, I wish there was something I can do to make you feel better.
We are aware of the problem you are referring too. But as far as increasing security, I'm afraid the library is very understaffed. I, I can't help you.
Hey.
Hey, you listen.
But you're not.
I think I saw Rachel out in the hall.
I feel pretty. Oh so pretty. I feel pretty and witty and...
Thanks.
Really?
Min. Oh Rach, you're still here, at our wedding, they were packing up the chopped liver about now.
Me neither. So you're like my big sister.
This will be your phone.
Hi, but I'm not here, you haven't met me. I'll make a much better first impression tomorrow when I don't have 20 hours of cab and plane on me.
Well, I think Brian's a little out of your league.
What?! Why?
The girl who won last year sold four hundred and seventy-five.
Y'know, I just was finally happy y'know. For the first time in my life! After my Dad left me, and then, and then getting arrested for stealing those birds, and then, and then the whole punctured lung thing! I can, it's still really hard to take deep breaths in cold weather, but with Alice all that stuff kinda went away. And now it's, and now it's gone and I don't know why!
Absolutely! Is Friday okay?
No, I-I-I gotta go.
Hey, Joey. Hey, buddy.
Well, I couldn't have done it without you buddy. You're a genius.
Uh, a little woozy, but basically okay.
No, you, you can't fit in that thing. That's not deep enough.
Rachel, I made you a cocoa.
That's right.
I'm not coming back.
Well, I kinda wanted to sell the cookies. The girl who sells the most wins a trip to Spacecamp, and gets to sit in a real space shuttle.
Well, ever since we announced the engagement, he's been acting really weird, and then last night, he came home smelling like Chanel.
Yeah well, thanks for bringing back what's left of him.
Ohh! We're kidding! Oh, we're kidding!
Hi!
Stop it!
Hey, what do you want to drink?
Uh, bye Monica.
You are playing American football?
Ohh... Oh! You were not meant to see me before the wedding. It's bad luck.
Hey! You're a good dancer!
Sorry, members only.
Oh you're awesome! And, in that last speech? You soaked me.
...because I have a list of five goofy coffee house guys and yesterday I bumped you for that guy over there.
Yeah. Yeah, excellent.
Chandler?
Forget it Rachel! We're both so proud of how well you're doing. I'm not gonna let you blow it. In fact, if I catch you with a cigarette, you're fired. So go on, get out of here! Go on, I don't want you breathing this stuff! Go on!
Alright!
Oh...my Gawd, I-I understand. I-I am so sorry, I'll go. Good-bye Monica , I wish you a lifetime of happiness with him. Chandler, you call me when this goes in the pooper.
Oh! Oh!
I suppose mainly sexual.
I'll never forget you Hans.
Hi.
Uh, the usher told us to come...
You've sung Happy Birthday to 20 different women today!
Nooo!
Hey.
It's the Gellers!
Oh, okay.
Who told you that?
Do you want a date Saturday?
Okay.
Sorry, I don't know any Earl.
It was your mother's idea. Ya know, she didn't want you to know your real father because it hurt her so much when he left, and, I didn't want to go along with it, but, well then she died and, and it was harder to argue with her. Not impossible, but harder.
Yeah, what's the gala for?
Uh, no! No! That's...art! If it bothers you I can put my art out.
What is going on?
No, but you should go to Chandler's. Because none of us knows how to cook, we'll probably just end up drinking all day.
It's laminated!
Okay.
Don't, I like it dirty.
I'm sure as hell a dancer, it's no use Marge will never go for me.
Uh Bing, I think we're gonna make this the last game.
Hi.
I did. Now I'm the idiot.
That reminds me of you so much, I mean umm, it-it's actually of Lenin. But, y'know at certain angles...
I thought you were Chandler. But umm, one of who is over there.
I had them made special.
No can do, like I told the girl, I can't get a new knob until Thursday.
Okay.
I still love you. And I know I probably shouldn't even be here telling you this, I mean you're with Chandler a guy I really like, and if you say he's straight I'll believe you! After seeing ya the other night I knew if I didn't tell ya I'd regret it for the rest of my life. Letting you go was the stupidest thing I ever did.
Dr. Geller!
Hi Monica.
Yo! Can I have your attention, please, Best Man, making a toast here. Thank you. I remember when Barry got home from his first date with Rachel...
Oh, that-that would be great. So you didn't even get to Italy?
Don't get up Jack! The safety pins are about to blow.
So once they caught on to the fact that we're, y'know, short and have breasts...
I had so much fun tonight, and what a great restaurant.
Ohh, y'know, Susan's gonna be shooting a commercial in London next week.
Because if you feel uncomfortable with your friend dating someone you work for, there are always ways to fix...that.
It's a bathing suit?
Well, she was leaving work and she was hit by a cab.
But...
So ah, Monica ready yet?
Yeah. I'm Stephanie.
I could have birds.
You don't know how that happened?! Your dog thought my diaphragm was a chew toy!
Ah Joey. Joey Tribbiani. Listen Joey, I got a problem, I just got a call from my dance captain, he's having a relationship crisis and can't get out of Long Island.
Hey, what kind of work do you do?
You picked a great couch.
No-no really, was-was that not okay?
Good.
Bye.
Bing! That's a great name.
Hey! I missed you.
So, I think you're ready to sell toner, do you have any last questions?
Wait a minute, his name is Dr. Bobby?
They still want me for General Hospital.
That's great.
I'm sorry I find it hard to believe that a group of people who spends as much time together as you guys do has never bumped uglies.
Ross, come on! Get in the bloody scrum! Ross, get in!
Phoebe?
Yeah, you can't eat that in my car.
Poco... a leetle.
What's he talking about?
Ohhhhhh!
So uh, Monica is Ross's sister.
Umm, is Tag here?
Oh well, um, your, your laundry just smelled so good, that I thought I'd curl up in it. Is that all right?
Alright.
I can't say.
Oh.
No.
Nothing. I, I just remembered I have to leave.
No I don't think so.
Oh, I'm sorry honey, I'm so, so, haaaaa! I'm so, so sorry, I just haaaaaa! But I, oh what happened was, I-I-I can't breathe. Can you get me a bag, or something?
Oh no! Oh no!
I guess he doesn't know.
Bye.
Rachel, please, don't make a scene.
Uh yes, I think I vaguely recall it.
Crap!!
Uh, the dog.
Yeah!
Almost! But first, we gotta start.
Thanks. Hey, listen, would you like to go to a movie sometime or something?
Well that's all right, you can come up to the front and dance with me.
You didn't marry your Barry. I did.
Oh cool! You made him cry!
No! No!
What is, honey?
Ohh, its been better. The Annual Net Usage Statistics are in.
Ohh, and I see you're having a little party too. Is she here, huh, huh?
You're doing great, you're doing fine.
Okay! See you later!
Our FDA approval didn't come through. Something about laboratory rats.
Ahh-ahh, we'd better call the fire department!
Cut.
Okay.
Yeah!! Little Leslie is here! We got another one! Oh my God, I can't believe I have two-two children. How scary is that?
Excuse me, that's 50 bucks.
I'm poor! I gotta take the bus!
Rust, is boat cancer, Ross.
Hi. I'm Rob Dohnen.
OK, well then who was the kid that got caught masturbating?
You found that handle, did ya?
Hi!
You got it.
Hi.
Okay, that's-that's not funny. Uhh.
I have a little comb.
No, unfortunately Lizzie's mom passed away shortly after she was born. I raised her by myself.
Everybody else got one, and you want one too. Don't you?
Hello, Waltham Interiors.
Rachel has those in burgendy.
Ohh, I love Chinese! How did you know I love Chinese?!
It doesn't really seem like enough to be fate.
Macaroni and cheese! We gotta make this!
You don't like puppies?
Those earrings look really lovely on you.
Oh, that's great. I'm stalking the wrong woman. I am such a dingus!
Im sorry, I didnt get... Susan is?
Come on, touch it!
Oh come on! Morning's here! Morning's here! The morning is here! Sunshine is here!
As were you.
Thanks Phoebe!
No! It's because that way the camera only sees her! Do you wanna try it?
A sandwich?
Anyway, I schedule performers for the childrens libraries around the city and I was just thinking, have you ever thought about playing your songs for kids?
Yeah. So how have you been doing?
No! No! I wanna see you take-off.
You do now. You're having dinner with me.
Umm, Frank Buffay.
Oh I know!!
You must be Ross.
Good luck, with your girlfriend.
Howard's the handy man!
Hey, you. He's just adorable.
No, you make them funny. You're the funny one!
So, here's somebody interesting, Joey. What do you know about Van Gogh?
Hi. Could I have a pack of Newport Lights, please?
Um-hum, you're jealous.
No-no it's okay. It's just that ah, I thought we had something pretty special here. And y'know I-I felt like you were someone I could finally open up to, and... That there's so much in me I have to share with you yet.
Sorry, it's not.
In a moment, please, I'm in the middle of a task. And you have a customer.
It could've been a hair straightener.
There's one thing missing.
Thanks.
All right, enough! I don't want to hear about it anymore! Good luck, Chandler.
That's alot of information to get in in thirty seconds! Alright Joey, if wanna leave, just leave. Rachel, no you weren't supposed to put beef in the trifle. It did not taste good. Phoebe, I'm sorry, but I think Jacques Cousteau is dead. Monica, why you felt you had to hide the fact that you were in an important relationship is beyond me.
She's upstairs. Monica! Come down! Everyone's here! Ross, Rachel, and the boy who hates Thanksgiving.
What do we got here?
Uh yeah, I can't believe I ever went out with somebody who would actually have an open flame in the middle of a wooden area.
Oh, oh oh!! I'm sorry, can I interrupt? You know I just want to say..That you are a horrible, horrible person.
You may kiss the bride.
Got it. Yeah all right. Yeah, okay.
No, but it'll be OK, they're pretty cool, my brother's straight so. . .
You were saying?
Yeah.
Kristen.
Hi Rachel.
It's-it's-it's almost dead!
Oh wow, look at this nice deep hole I've been digging. Hey Bert, isn't this a nice hole here. Hey.
Yeah, I'm gonna say no.
I'll be back in ten minutes.
Yoko. I've decided to go to Minsk without you.
Alright, alright, I can get my own coat.
Oh!
Oh my god! Youre amazing!
This witness won't return my calls so we're gonna see if we can surprise him coming home.
Well...
Yeah?
Oh Fonzie.
No.
I told you, we're adding new operators all the time. Could we concentrate on my training?
Really?!
Hi!!
All right.
Yes. Uh, can't you wait until tomorrow? All right. Unbelievable!!
Can I please see your face?
Really Mr. Geller, you don't have to do this.
Why not?
Ahh.
Kate?
Nothing. Ok, everything. I think we're calling off the wedding.
And anyhow, I'm sorry I was so harsh before, but you have to understand that I still look at Lizzie like she's a twelve-year-old girl.
It's been so long! Last time I saw you, you were setting up your tent in line to see Return of the Jedi.
God! Ross!
Uh no, I have to go in a few hours. I have to be on the red-eye. Well listen, y'know, next time you're in Minsk umm...
Oh, no!! No, no!
That's a good one.
Thank you sweetheart.
So, all right.
Good luck.
And then right, right when the scene ends, he could take her with this raw, animal....
Okay, so let me just get this straight. You're accusing me of cheating on you, and insulting my performance?
Oh, you watched the show! What'd you think?
I guess you guys heard, Rachel dumped me.
Yeah!
Elizabeth, what are you doing here?!
Are you guys going to Chandler's for Thanksgiving?
No. And I don't think I'm gonna want to.
Well, this isn't how I was hoping how this would end, but I guess I have to appreciate your honesty.
Ohh, so cute.
Bye.
Really?
Fleischman's group. Whatever you do, don't touch his sandwiches. Ha-ha-ha...
All we want is two Caffe Lattes.
Hey, Pheebs! Hi!
Hi! Rachel Green's office.
Looks like that might come any minute.
Yeah, get out! Now!
Phoebe, Phoebe relax, it's okay. I mean we never said this was exclusive.
Um, maybe 15, 16 years.
Your not doing it.
Alright, that is not your father, that's just a picture of a guy in a frame.
Well, if I had to chose right now, which by the way I find really weird, I would have to say, Chandler.
How-how I like to melt stuff, and how I dislike stuff that doesn't melt.
Hey! Rachel!
Monica! I think Rachel's here!
Don't spoil it.
Umm, yeah-no thanks.
I...I uh, actually just moved from four blocks over.
I can still see you!
Great.
Im gonna wait till after we order. Its her, right.
Red Barbra?
So you work at Bloomingdale's, huh? My mom calls it Bloomies.
Actually, I'm dating at all anymore. See, I figured out that I was only dating guys that were like y'know bad for me, so until I work that out...
Wait. You're right. I know you're right. And, thanks for being so nice. Here
It's kidney stones.
No, I ahh, had another idea.
Are you interested in this ring?!
You have a very impressive resume, Ms. Green. I especially like what I see here about implementing a new filing system.
Smelly Cat, Smelly Cat, what are they feeding you? Smelly Cat, Smelly Cat, it's not your fault.
Yeah, but you didn't.
I had a really nice time tonight.
What'd you think I was, a hooker?
We were playing rugby.
Are you alright?
Ohh, well when you said all you were going to be doing between now and the time you leave is packing, you didn't really leave me much choice. Did you?
Rachel is my girlfriend.
Oh, candles! What is that? A blanket? A video camera? Oh my God!
I know I couldn't. So....
Hi Rachel!
And who is your friend?
Well, go ahead Rachel.
Yeah. My Dad says if I spend as much time helping him clean apartments, as I do daydreaming about outer space, he'd be able to afford a trip to the Taj Mahal.
That's not so good.
The one with "Heston" on it.
Oh, yeah!
Ah, cool! Taco shells! You know, these are... they're like a little corn envelope.
No, I umm, I read about her in Mom's suicide note.
So, who's the lucky guy?
Yeah.
I just want to say that Ross is a wonderful young man.
France sucks!
I'm sorry?
Here you go honey. One Diet Coke with ice.
Ready to go?
Okay.
Hey, it's everybody.
Well, that doesn't mean she can't look nice!
Phoebe! That's a great name.
Hi, nice to meet you. Kate Miller.
I came to talk to you about Howard.
Don't do that to yourself. Any one of us could have tripped over that little girls jump-rope.
Oh my God! What are you doing here?
Hi!
With a K.
All right. This is the kitchen.
Isn't there?
Wow, I didn't know they let you keep chickens and ducks as pets.
Well I'm sorry.
What's with you?
Come on, you got the shopping bags and the Sack's catalog.
I see. Have you considered therapy?
All rightie, everybody look at me. Good. All right, its time. Bridesmaids and ushers let's see two lines, thank you.
Yeah, but even soo.
And while we're on the subject of news..
That's sweet. Could I take her?
C'mon hurry, hurry.
Santa!
Not on purpose, he ricocheted of you and got me.
Hey.
Ok, all right, well aren't there times when you come home at the end of the day, and you're just like, 'if I see one more cup of coffee'...
That's right.
Hi!
Oh. Uh, what?
Oh hey! Good, you're both here.
So. I guess I'll see you around.
You gonna slice them up real nice?
Oh yeah, I still hang with Simmons and Zana, y'know. I see Spindler a lot. Devane, Kelly, and I run into Goldie from time to time. Steve Brown, Zuchoff, McGwire, J.T., Breadsly.
Bing! Read your Computech proposal, a real homerun. Ooh. Barely got ya that time, get over here. Come on. Wham! Good one. That was a good one. Keep at it team.
Oh, that's okay, it gave me time to finish glazing my nipples.
Excuse me... This hospital is for people!
Sorry, there's just more room out here.
Wow, uh, anything else I should know?
Because I think about shaving it all off again sometime.
Well, I'm going to go into my new apartment now. Ehh!
Of course you did. Look Ross, you can't get an annulment unless you and Rachel are both there.
Monica... Hey Mon, I have a question. Is Leroy the baddest man in the whole damn town or the fattest man in the whole damn town?
Thank you.
No, you didn't. The only thing that freaked me out was you saying that nothing could ever happen between us.
I missed you. I'm gonna get changed.
Yeah.
Let us begin. Dearly beloved...
Joey Tribbiani. Yes, ok. Hold on. She wants to talk to you. Take the phone.
Phoebe?
Oww!!!! Joey, she just kicked me.
No, Joey!
Baywatch!!
I told 'em your candy is absolutely indescribable!
We might still have some money, if your father didn't think it was a good idea to sell ice over the Internet.
Joey, I'm gonna tell you the same thing I told Al Minser and his pyramid of dogs. Take any job you can get and don't make on the floor.
Y'know, when I saw you at the store last week, it was probably the first time I ever mentally undressed an elf.
So when people complement me on my cooking should I, what do I say?
Yes sir.
A couple of hours, I feel awful.
Dance with your father.
She's probably not even very pretty, just young enough so that everything is still pointing up.
Hey Joe, you ever think about joining the force? We could use a guy like you.
Ms. Waltham?
Hey, you keep pushing me on this, my foots going to meet the middle of your ass.
How you doin'?
Wait. I wanna show you something.
Oh Hans.
Um, leave.
Oh my God!
Dr. Farber, we've got a bit of an emergency here...Jason Costalano is choking on his retainer.
Surprise.
Let's go!!
Excuse me?
Whoa!!
Come in.
Y'know, that's-that's fine, but the line is, "Hmm, soup."
I think my character's gonna need a little bit more of reason than that.
Did you pick out the vowels?
Well, they don't have to know that...
I'm just sayin', if I see one more picture of Ed Begley, Jr. in that stupid electric car, I'm gonna shoot myself! I mean, don't get me wrong... I'm not against environmental issues per se.... it's just that guy!
Do you know how fast you were traveling back there?
If you're planning on doing that throughout the entire flight. Please tell me now. So that I could that a sedative...or perhaps slip you one.
Hi honey.
He went out for groceries.
Look, youre cold, I have to pee, and... ..theres a cup of coffee on the window. How bad could it be?
Ross. You and I are going to have to have a little talk.
Well, Jamie was the name of Susan's first girlfriend, so we went back to Jordie.
What are you going to do? Kill him? Like you did with Charles?!
Chandler?
You wouldn't return my calls, you sent back my letters....
It's open! Come in!
May I see your boarding pass?
The only person that should feel awkward is you, and you didn't tell him not to call me, did you?
I'm sorry, but I can't say.
Yeah.
Ahh! Fair, schmair! Y'know? Look, if you want to get back at Ross, I am here for you. Really? No-no, I say-I say, I say we get back at him right on this couch. Right here!
Oh, Jack look, there's that house paint commercial that cracks you up.
Meet me in the nocturnal house in 15 minutes.
No-no, I heard what you said, funny. I like funny. This team is about hard work, but it's also about having fun. Good to have you aboard Bing!
What kinda change?
Were you this cute in high school?
What about Benitez?
Hi.
It wasn't my decision!
Well, let's go to a bad one and make out.
Well, it's nice to know that you...
Oh no.
You don't think they'll judge and ridicule me?
..you add a pinch of saffron, it makes all the difference.
We already got the results back on that on, and they're not good.
Bakersfield!
They have parasites?
Woooo hoooo!!!
Hey Joey!
Janice has a question. Who of the six of you has sleep with the six of you?
Good idea! Yes!
But you're not bald.
What?
Oh, right. He is so great. But that's over.
That was a great lecture today. Did you get a little hair cut?
Ohh!
Really? Because I think about you all the time.
...and you sand it and you varnish it...
No, I wanna melt it.
Hey.
Yeah, just, I feel like I'm about a hundred. I thought I was just one of the guys.
We love you. Buy.
He told on us?
Actually, that's our three hole punch.
You really didn't have to. Wow.
Hey, everybody!
This is nice. I pay two hundred dollars for dinner, you put down twenty, and you come out looking like Mr. Big Shot. You really want to be Mr. Big Shot? Here, I'll tell you what, you pay the whole bill, Mr. Big Shot, all right.
What?
Well, okay, so what's now-go get, go get the eggs, put 'em in there.
Hi! What's going on?
Oh that would be great!
What one?
F.Y.I.. I've decided to pay a professional musician to play in here on Sunday afternoons. Her name is Stephanie... something. She's supposed to be very good.
Can't hear you!
No.
Well, maybe that's because you spent four years ignoring me. I mean, would it have been so hard to say 'Morning, Luisa'? Or 'Nice overalls'?
Ahh, yes.
What's different?
...No, we hate him.
I found the picture!
Great.
Of course, you did. Forgot something else too ya bastard! Well, what about you? You're not feeling left out or anything are ya?
I'm gonna go talk to uh, a friend.
Yeah, it's-it's my only weird thing, I swear. And I-I-I would've told you about it, but I didn't know they would be here.
How?
Actually its, Vatican City. Now ahh, what do you know about vulcanised rubber?
I-I'm sorry. I, I-I-I believe I ate that.
Can't you see what's going on here, this man is dying.
What do you mean? Yesterday you said I was too pretty to pay for stuff!
Okay, you guys free tonight?
Me too.
Oh. Well, I wish I could say no, but you can't stay my assistant forever. Neither can you Sophie, but for different reasons.
Here I am!
Yeah, but this is
You're into hardcore S&M right?
Uh, I gotta apologize for Kara's coffee. Y'know, I feel sorry for it if it ever got in a fight, it's not strong enough to defend itself. Did you hear what I said Bing?
Well, maybe after we get reacquainted uh, you can do me.
I'd love it too. Shoot, I gotta go. So, I'll talk to you later.
Look, I just wanted to have coffee with Rachel.
They say he's only got half a tank left.
Oh hey, great, you're up. Rachel, this is my sister Krista. Krista, this is Rachel.
So I was wondering....
Um, coffee to go, please.
Oh dark mother, once again I suckle at your smokey tit.
Oh! Okay! Phew!
Buon Giorno, Bella Phoebe!
No, under these circumstances it has to be an injection, and it has to be now.
How could it be so much? The receptions at their house.
Is she gonna be all right?
Good deal.
Hi.
Ross, whose glasses are those?
3-B!
You told on us?
Hey, that's weird, today's my birthday too!
That's right Wesley! I just stopped by to say that, you're not a real doctor! And that woman's brain, is fine!
And where is your hat?
Yeah, I do. Of course, I learned at my aunt's dog grooming shop, but hey, what do you say?
Would you mind spending some time on my siadic area, it's been killing me today.
Oh yeah!
Well, Telia Shire suddenly became available.
Okay.
Hello, Rachel.
This is a glaucoma test.
I just came by to give you a kiss, I have to go pick up the baby, so. I'll see you later sweetheart, you too Chandler.
I didn't think you were gay. I do now.
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Wait-wait!
Oh, he won't sit here. Only the people in the white coats sit over there, and only the people in the blue blazers sit here.
Yes necessarily! I mean, I dunno what it is, maybe it's the Amish thing.
Ross! Ross! Come on! Get in here! Ross! Come on!
'Cause you're a little princess! "Daddy, buy me a pizza. Daddy, buy me a candy factory. Daddy, make the cast of Cats sing Happy Birthday to me..."
But seriously, I believe that we should all support President Clinton. And her husband Bill.
Oh, yeah! I-I ran into you in the hallway in your building. It was right after I slept with Joey. He dumped me the next day.
And the spitting?
Happy birthday.
Honey, uh we, we can talk about this. It's just that it's costing about a hundred dollars a minute to be in here.
Yeah. Well see ya upstairs. See ya pals.
Phoebe, it's okay that you feel this way. I mean it is soon. And there's a lot of things we don't know about each other, and I just figure that everything I really like. And the things I don't know, I get to learn about at someplace with both our names on the mailbox.
For God's sake, will you let it go? There's no Rachel!
Mmm.
Oh my God!
Of course we're hitting faces, why wouldn't you hit faces?
Chandler is fantastic!!
Phoebe, we have rules here, this isn't that kind of place.
So, anyone up for a midnight dip in the ocean?
Ohh, no. Ugh. Oh, leaving London, my whole family lives there.
Oh, I was going to offer you my apartment.
All right, you two, stop it!
Are they here yet?
Hey Joey, I got some beer for you.
Well it's somewhere in between. You see, in a strictly technical sense, of course, I'm not uh..., well I, I mean I haven't ever uh...
The one in the director's chair.
You okay there, slugger?
Hello!
Yeah, I'm really looking forward to it.
Someone in there?
Your turn.
Hi!
Oh great! Oh, you. Umm, what's up?
Yeah, well, it would've been, but uh, my parents just moved here.
Welcome everybody, welcome to Amazing Discoveries!
No.
I don't care! You just get him!
Okay, I'll see you in a bit.
Yeah, ummm, I don't like the hat that much.
Well uh, after you ran out on your wedding, Barry's parents told people that you were sort of....insane.
Rachel we tried to quit, but it was too hard!
Even if he were... cornered?
Eh, worth a shot. Look Joey, let me know where you're staying, okay?
Excuse me for a moment, will you please, I want to say good night to the Levines, before we go.
I could... but I won't. If I find that monkey, he's mine.
What?
I'll just throw them out.
Why are your eyes so white?
Why can't we just have what we have now? Why can't we just talk, and laugh, and make love, without feeling obligated to one another... and up until tonight I thought that's what you wanted too.
Hey! Hi!
Wait-wait a minute; that doesn't make any sense.
You have me!
Well, I would make them Belgian, but the waffles are hard to get into that flask.
Whaddo I mean. Whaddya mean, whaddo I mean? I mean underpants, mister, that's what I mean.
Oh, I still do. Next year, I hope to make varsity though.
Hey.
Well, I'm sorry. I just thought I'd try to make the place a little nicer.
Christmas eve.
Oh, sure. Sure, absolutely.
Yeah. Did you tell someone that I was gay?
Well, it's time for a new family to start their memories here and hopefully their check will clear before they find the crack in the foundation and the asbestos in the ceiling.
...but when all is said and done, he still drinks out of the mugs.
Maybe we didn't make it clear enough.
We don't have to.
You're telling me this couch was delivered to you like this?!
Hi Ralph.
Now, remember, nobody else drives that cab.
Oh my God!
What four of us?
Hey, honey! Okay, so did you find any apartments? Anything in Brooklyn Heights?
Really?!
Oh-kay, we'll have a table for you in about 45 minutes.
That's terrible! I'm sorry!
I'll never remember all of that. So uh, what's the deal? Rachel comes home, people pop out and yell stuff, is that it?
For what?
I can do that.
Oh, you're busy, that's ok, I'll get it. Anybody else want one?
Thanks.
Nobody sees the king!
What are you doing?
O-kay. Look, it, it was stupid.
We'd better take these pants off upstairs or that stain's gonna set.
Yes! Although, I think we may be seeing a little too much of some people. Aren't you a little old to be wearing a dress like that?
I'm sorry, is this the same Rachel who's name you said at the altar in the second marriage?
You are so bad!
Listen Joey, we definitely want to see you for the callback on Saturday.
Okay, see ya!
What's this? Blue nail polish?
What?! I've never seen one before!
Ready?
Oh please. Every moment is precious. Y'know? Besides, somebody had to ride in that other taxi with the rest of your luggage, and your friends don't really seem to care too much that you're leaving.
That's a good one!
Ho-ho, I will.
Is this about me taking your watch?
All right.
Are you sure, I can crush a walnut with my butt.
Monopoly!
You mean Dr. Geller?
Monica bang!
Where do I know you from?
I have to be heading to my chateau, thank you.
A little.
Would you.......Would you hug me?
I think you'll like it, it has two out of the three tenors.
How are you Ms. Hot Shot chef with the big fancy restaurant with the best chicken ever!
1...2...
Don't worry son, we'll just attach it and-
My god. You still have your Christmas lights up?
Rachel, one of your customers seems to have left his billfold. A Joshua Bergen.
Yeah, could you scooch?
What about Julie?
You are mad!
That's one way! Me, I- I went for the watch.
Yeah, I was just kidding.
You want me to cancel it?
He musta been sweepin'. They found a broom in his hand.
C'mon, this is us.
Hey, hold on a second.
Yeah, I know. I hate it too. Look, maybe we should just tell them.
Well, I don't know. I mean it's not like we don't have anything in common. I mean I like uh, pizza.
But, we can't go now. It looks like Rachel's gonna put on a skit.
Hi.
Which one? Which button, Jack.
Oh I, I have plans tonight.
No.
Yeah, let's go.
Eh, he said, thank you very much, he thinks you look very pretty tonight, your hair, golden like the sun. So you're a chef?
Ben. Ben. Ben's good. How come you never mentioned Ben before?
It's Alan.
Hey-hey-hey Joey!
Alright.
Oh, Ross!
You're doing it again.
Which means you had seven years of beach fun and you can't put a price on that sweetie.
Thanks.
That's the best one! Oh my God, thank you so much!
I guess I'm saying, I'll try and quit. I kinda like that you worry about me.
No, that's not exactly what I was..
I forgot my purse.
How you doin'?
You know, you're a really great listener. Most guys I go out with, they just talk and talk.
No-no I heard! I'm just sorry.
Absolutely, yeah!
There is a little child inside this man!
I'm sorry guys, closed set.
So it's just your mother then.
Really? You two?
Ha! Ahhhhhhh!
What?
Tell her, David. 'I don't wanna go to Minsk and work with Lifson and Yamaguchi and Flench, on nonononononono. I wanna stay here and make out with my girlfriend!!'
Yes.
What contracts?
No.
That's fine.
Would you like to spend the night in jail?
Ross, are you there? Ross, I don't know if you can hear this but... I'm gonna talk anyway, uh, I'm in the States with you sister and your friends and it's all over with Colin. I came here to tell you that, and to tell you-Yes, Joey you can have all the chocolate you want, just take it! Uh, I came here to tell you that I love you.
No!
Um, yeah, I'm just... ..working.
Nice to meet you Monica. Bing!
No, you didn't. Hi, I'm Kathy.
You okay? You all right?
Just a little gag gift somebody gave me. Put your hands together.
Ooh, that's great, I love those little guys.
I gotta go.
Hey, what happened to you?
Right.
I mean, I know what I'm talking about. I gave up two babies, and I only wish I had someone there that had given up babies, that could tell me how terrible it is to give up babies. I just think that, it would be something you will regret every single day for the rest of your life. So, how ever hard it is to give up this puppy, it would be like a million times harder to give up a child. I really shouldn't have given you the puppy first.
'Cause Rachel told me uh, you were dying to have a threesome with me and uh, Drew Barrymore. By the way, Drew has some groundrules and...
We've lost visual contact with the suspect.
Well it was Chandler! We didn't think he'd ever propose!
Well, at least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar...
You're a genius, Ross.
You want a piece of me, sir? Is that what your saying? You want a piece of me?
Ross.
Ohh!!
One-Mississippi! Two-Mississippi! Three-Mississippi!
Actually, I'm reading it to the baby.
Hi, this is Dick Clark, live in Times Square. We're in a virtual snowstorm of confetti here in Times Square...
Okay. Okay.
OK, everyone gather up.
Basically, we think you're a horrible human being, and bad things should happen to you.
Hey Chandler, here's this morning's projections.
Well, this has been fun.
Is your finger caught in that chair?
Oh, no.
Okay, Ms. Lambert handles all our closures. Would you come over here please?
Mom, Dad, what are you guys doing here?
Oh, that is so not true.
You have a son?
Clearly, I'm having sex with him?
What did you say?!
Your thinking about my leg aren't you?
I wasn't thinking. I was too busy fallin'...
Well someone does.
Sure! That would be nice.
Hey.
Not as impressive as you. I gotta tell you, I looked at your record and you've done some pretty weird stuff.
Are you Phoebe Buffay?
Don't you let her go! You're a lucky guy!
Would you like some gum?
Well okay, if it means that much to you, then I'll ask him out.
Say uh, Bing, did you hear about the new law firm we got working for us?
Hi!
Y'know, all I'm looking for is the money.
Yeah he's no good. Do you ever think about me in a non-eye doctor way?
You got a problem with that?
Well, if we learned one thing today C.H.E.E.S.E. is that cheerleaders and high explosives don't mix.
Yeah, it was.
I really can't say.
It was Max's stuff.
Whoooaa!
Hey, no way, I'm in the shot man.
You don't want him, but you don't want me to have him?
Hmm.
Because if you're not moving forward, y'know you're just moving backwards.
I know. I know! I'm a duplex.
He always ridiculed my pottery classs...
Well you, her, I mean, she's very...y'know. And you're like...y'know.
Hi Rachel.
No I didn't.
Rachel was just helping me out. My head got all sunburned.
I know! I know! And then you lose your apartment! And then you lose your job! And then your ex-wife gets married so fast! And now the coffee-ahh!! Ross, we need to talk.
Oh no. I thought you said they could shoot the spot without you.
Sure.
...Hey! You're in a play! I didn't know you could dance! You had a beard!
Who?
I know, I know. Just hang in there, OK. OK, I'll go out first, alright.
Actually, that can't happen. Yeah because you all have such different looks, we're putting you with Raymond and Kyle with Ben. So it'll be either you two or you two.
I played Smelly Cat for the people at my old ad agency, they went nuts.
What? Is it my breath?
And the vet said it was time. And so from half a world away, while my Mother held the phone to his ear, I said good bye to my dog,. In seven languages.
Good-bye Chandler Bing.
No way!
Well I mean, you're American to start with. You don't even have rugby here.
I can't believe this. I just-I can't believe this. How-how-Oh my God. How long ago?
So are you his mother or his father?
No you do. You... just...
All right, I need a clamp, sterile towel, and channel 31.
YOU IDIOT!!!!!
Y'know you could totally sell this. It'd be perfect for like umm, a kitty litter campaign.
So, you wanna get a hamburger or something?
I'd really rather talk to him.
Hey.
Do I know why we're rushing?
Well umm, maybe if it had more heat.
They don't?
So you know what I'm talking about, right?
I'll be right with you. Okay? Thanks, Wendy.
You guys make me fly! High! Okay, we're gonna pick it up here, tomorrow.
Sophie, get in here! You see! Now you're making Sophie uncomfortable!
Oh, I got it.
To get my coat.
I am Julio.
What?!
Oh, wow! You remembered! Oh! It's a Judy Jetson thermos!
Hmm, noodle soup.
Oh, hi.
Hello, sweetheart.
Please, let me do something.
Oh thank you.
This isn't your toe, this is a small, very cold piece of carrot.
Oh, I-I-I understand all that, but it's just-that was my puppy.
Oh, I must've said that after you left.
Oh?
Oh no!
Monica? My God you used to be so. . . I mean you, you, you, you must have lost like. . . You look great.
Noth- I was- I was just saying to my-
Elizabeth!
Actually, I'm not here to complement the chef.
No, thank you. Chandler!
Over here Jack. OK. I see, Rachel's coming up the path. Oh doesn't she look pretty. Jack, get this.
Hi Ben!
No. Because I know how to write men that women fall in love with. Believe me, I cannot sell a Paolo. People will not turn three hundred twenty-five pages for a Paolo. C'mon, the guy's a secondary character, a, y'know, complication you eventually kill off.
There are no hardware stores open past midnight in the Village.
Margha.
Okay! Thank you! That was great!
Hey.
No, you're my first. Put the money on the table.
So?
No we won't.
Bye Phoebe.
But my apartment is so...
Hey.
Danny! Hurry up! The bath is getting cold!
It's uh, 27 dollars even.
Yeah, if I have to. Monica, I don't wanna lose you, so if I have to do it all over again, then I will.
Hey Rachel!
Yeah?
Tell me everything.
I'm sorry?
Yes, and she's very supportive.
Lights. Uh, romantic lights.
My funny valentine, sweet comic valentine! You make me high over my heart!
Umm, actually, I came down to ask you a big favour.
No, Gary Collins is the host. You'll be answering the phones.
13.
Oh! Wow! Hey!
You are no longer authorized to distribute birthday muffins.
Um, oh, I don't know. I mean, it's definitely weird not being with Ross, but I guess I'm doing OK. Actually I've got some of his stuff that he, um....
Yep.
Yeah!
Okay, we're not.
No, I just thought it was cute.
Bon giorno tutti!
Great!
It's uh, $12.50.
Oh, yeah!
You missed the exit!
You have been M.I.A for the past seven sorority newsletters, what's up with you?!
Why?
Hello Skidmark.
Well, now we've gotta find something fun for you!
Morning.
You have a Miss Monica Geller here.
Oh, well obviously you know Barbara and I split up, otherwise you wouldn't have done the head tilt.
I'm actually the office manager.
You work and you work and you work at a marriage but all he cares about is his stupid boat.
Actually, I'm here about the assistant job.
Chicken? Chicken boy!
Me too!
Bye.
Oh, damn! I got it on my pants.
Well, I'm from California.
Your name, please?
Yeah. I felt a little weird about it. You're a teacher. I'm a student. But would you maybe want to go out with me sometime?
Oh, here they are right here.
Charla, 278. Sorry, dear, but still good.
Rach! Come on! Rach!
Nice uh, costume.
Well ah, what can you swing?
Pizza guy!
The Waltham Residence.
Oh Drake.
Sure. What?
All right. Okay. I'm starving!
You were fired? What're you gonna do?
Hi Phoebe.
Kate Miller's awkward and mannered portrayal is laughable. Badda-badda-badda. Ah-ha! Here it is! The direction by Marshal Talmant is... Thank you, boys and girls, you've ruined my life. Please, stuff your talentless faces with my Mother's crab cakes! Excuse me!!
We can't find another place. Then we can't have the wedding! I've ordered chicken and salad and-and cake for 150. What should be the most wonderful day of my life is rapidly turning into just Sunday with a spectacular amount of food!
Guess what? Ben is going to be in a TV commercial!
How are we gonna get out of that one?
Well, apparently I'm willing to offer her things that you are not.
I think we have an answer.
Yesss?
...This is kind of embarrassing, but occasionally after I've been intimate with a man...
Umm, I'm actually a first year resident, but I get that a lot, you see, I-I graduated early...
You know what makes the itching even worse?
And cut!
Have the final numbers on my desk by Tuesday.
Yeah, that-that Chandler cracks me up.
Good bye Ross.
He's the kind of guy you're friends with, y'know? But he's not the kind of guy you date. He's the kind of guy you'd date because you did. Me, not so much.
When?
But now I know I don't have a choice about this, I was born this way.
The platoon is dead! Face facts Tony!
Hey! Hey! No rough holding in my ER!
No, no, no.
I think you'll find this room more to your liking.
Chandler.
Hey! Hey! Hey! This is 92.3, WXRK, K-Rock for our $1,000 daily challenge.
Okay, um, don't take this the wrong way, but your place kinda has a weird smell.
My skirt, you lifted, kids laughing. I was Susie Underpants 'till I was 18.
What do you mean, your seat?
I don't like you going out with my daughter Ross.
No, it's-it's Andrew.
Shut the book!
Chandler!
Oh great! Wow! Yeah, it's comfortable.
Oh! Sorry! Umm, I actually do need to talk to you.
Or I'll call you!
I dropped a cup.
You tell your friend Chandler that we're definately broken up this time.
You wanted to see me Professor Geller?
Just a small tranquiliser.
Excuse me?
Seeing some more of your super-cool slides.
Knock knock!How are we today? Any nausea?
Nice to meet you Mac!
According to recent findings!
Um.. we should really be sitting for this.
What are you doing here?
...on the rocks with a twist? I remember.
Hey!
Wait, how do you zoom out? There she is.
I can't until I'm the ultimate fighter. I will do it. I'm telling you, the day will come when children will argue over who will win a fight, me or Superman. Now, I'm not saying I could beat Superman, but y'know, kids are stupid.
You are so fired.
Uh actually, I'd like to speak with both of you.
Okay.
We got the grant. Three years, all expenses paid.
So I understand you're looking for a place.
Wait a minute! Take your pants.
I'm hungry. Wanna get some pizza? You can keep yelling if there's more.
Yeah, I heard it.
It got caught on my watch.
Well, I hope you're gonna bid on some things Rachel.
Yes, Papaya Extract.
I'm sorry.
Okay.
Thanks! Enjoy your funeral.
Hey, how's my favorite parenting team doing?
I think my uterus just skipped a beat.
Gotcha.
...the lullabye of...
Okay, you know, one of two things is happening here. Either you're seeing somebody behind my back, which would make you the biggest jerk on the planet. Or, else you're pretending that you're seeing somebody, which just makes you so pathetic that I could start crying right here in the cereal aisle. So like which of these two guys do you want to be?
He's kind of intense huh?
By the way, Chandler. I cut you out of all my pictures. So if you want, I have a bag with just your heads.
Here, monkey. Here, monkey! Here, monkey! Gotcha.
I'm not very fond of New York. Queens I like. Ooh, what is this sparkle something! Honey! Huh?
Oh look, you don't have to give it too me right now! You can slip it under my door.
Be right there. Be back in a sec.
Well, he's doing terrible!
Plate. Plate. Plate.
Oh hi kids. Hi darling.
You know! At the place I told you about last night?
But... he gets it back, pass to the middle, lines it up and... BAM! Yes! Could that shot BE any prettier?
Yeah! That's right. Yeah-yeah! Yeah!
Oh, Liam.
You brought a picnic, oh, what a boyfriend. That's it, on Monday I start wearing make-up.
Yes, I'm familiar with the concept. We can just look for it.
You too.
Well? Aren't you gonna do something?
Yay!!
Umm, no.
Ooohhh.
Hi, Ross.
Good afternoon, are you the decision maker of the house?
Yeah. Thank you.
Do you two know each other?
What?
Kenny the copyboy.
Now, I want you to tell me what you're doing while you're doing it.
Oy.
I've literally never been this happy.
What 'cha doing?
Wow.
I know a guy who's the 18th.
Okay, so what you used to have with Rachel, is what I've got with Alice.
Flight's in an hour. I-I gotta go.
You are!
Frank Jr. Jr.!!
You mean dying man?
Yeah, I'd really like that.
Help!
Then uh, what's-what's this?
Yeah? Well, there's a lot of things Carol never did before I came along.
There are a couple of forms to fill out.
Where is this party?
Hey! Sugar-O's!
That's very thoughtful of you. It's very thougtful.
You do realize that you won't have access to our new full service Swedish spa.
Could you guys help me?
How hot are we?
Yes you did! What was it?
You really enjoyed yourself didn't you?
Really?! Congratulations. When's the big day?
As I recall when we got married, I saw the groom in the wedding dress.
I left a bra drying on the shower rod, you don't think your son will think it's yours and be horribly traumatised?
That's quite all right, but I feel obligated to tell you that this meeting is being videotaped.
Okay. And don't worry, I'm not just gonna take you out for donuts.
Thank you for your patience, you're the next caller.
It looks like your uterus is ready for implantation.
Well they said I should bring someone. Do you wanna be my dance partner?
Definitely her.
This should be fun.
Yeah, I-I considered that. I just know it would make me happy.
Hello, funny Valentine.
I notice that you've been trusted with a lot of rather important responsibilities.
Stop saying that. I hate that.
Actually they were Nana's.
Hey uh, I don't mean to be presumptuous but I have these two tickets to the ballroom dancing finals tomorrow night if you want to go?
No that's La Guardia. This is Mexico.
Y'know what, I gotta go. And thank you so much for coming.
I see. Well, I wish you both a lifetime of happiness. So you're bald?
You're gonna kill me!
Oh, no. Oh, no.
Okay.
Umm, no. Thanks, but I'll give these to Betty. So I read your evaluation of Tag, or to use his full name, Tag Sweetcheeks Jones. Is something going on with you two?
Right there! That's my car! Hey!!
Can I see your license please?
What is wrong now?!
You know, I don't know what I'm looking for.
No, no, no, she's nice but, y'know, it just it made me realize that I'm just not, I'm just not ready to be dating, y'know?
So you still think you, um... might want that fifth date?
Ok, just one more point.
Uh-huh.
All right Miss Green, everything looks fine... Yep, I think we're starting to see some real progress here.
Well, here's your phone doctor.
So this is it? Victor?
Nice to meet you Joey.
It's called the cherry.
Oh my God!!
I'm not gonna tell you! You're the bad man who broke Sarah's leg.
What?
Wait, you're not 'G.Stephanopoulos?' Man, my dad's gonna kill me!
Hey, be right there.
Whattaya say we make these, uh, coffees Irish?
You've been married twice?
Hi!
Of course! It's her favorite.
To the Bings!
Woah, woah, woah, what're, what're you talkin' about man.
Folks, when we come back we'll be talking about her new book, 'Euphoria Unbound': the always interesting Nora Tyler Bing. You might wanna put the kids to bed for this one.
Oh that's great! You are the best!
Here you go.
beside meeeee-eeee-ee. .
Ohhhh.
Hey, Rach!
It took you that long to figure it out, huh?
I know.
Ohh! Yes of course, thank you, thank you, thank you so very much.
Yeah, and they-and they say that our-that our only chance to have a baby is that if they take my sperm, her egg and put it together in a dish and then put it into another girl. So we were wondering if you could be the girl that we could put it into.
So, these will match the jacket you picked out for me last week?
You dog!
In the moment, yeah.
Y'know, it's a shame, because you and Lowell would've made a great couple.
Texas?
Listen, we both know you're gonna do it 'cause you're not a jerk. Okay? So you can either sulk here for a half hour and then go pick them up, or save us both time and sulk in the car.
My god, what happened?
Taxi.
Yep, sucks!
I ran into Vlad at the place where they sell the big fish, and he said you played here a lot, so umm....
So I'll see you at the party? Beer's beer man, 24, 7!!
Hi! So, how did it go at the doctors?
Not really.
Aww!
No, your a masseuse, it's cool, I'm not a cop.
Hey Joey, we're ready for ya! Joey, this is Alex he's going to be playing your son.
Oh, no-no, y'know I absolutely adore Rachel it's just that, well it might be a awkward for you. But it's absolutely your decision. More tea?
Well that's wonderful. . . I
Okay, I'll pay you tomorrow.
Hey you guys, umm do either one of you want to get in there before I take my bath.
Hello, I'm looking for Bob. This is Jane. I don't know if you're still at this number, but I was just thinking about us, and how great it was, and, well, I know it's been three years, but, I was kinda hoping we could hook up again. I barely had t he nerve to make this call, so you know what I did?
What?
What?
You're straight. I get it.
Okay. He's cute, he's funny, he's-
'We' would be me and Rick.
Oh my God!
It is okay, if I stay and watch?
It did at first, but not anymore.
I'm sorry. Was I not supposed to?
This is worse than when he married the lesbian.
Oh, thank you Chandler! I just bought it.
I gotta go.
No, you can't use your watch.
Hey, can we get some cappuccino over here?
Well uh, do either of you smoke?
Oh, say no more!
I just hope...
I didn't even have a chance to act as though I'm okay with it!
What?!
Dope!
That's not my monkey. Just the dress is mine, you can send that back whenever.
I mean, I can't-I can't be in the same room as her! It drives me mad just thinking of you being in the same room as her!
We stopped at the gift shop.
It's Pam.
Umm, that was really great, but I-I gotta take-off actually.
Right. Could you sign this?
Well, we determined the cause of the fire.
No, ma'am. Well, anyhoo, we should be getting our F.D.A. approval any day now, hopefully, in time for Thanksgiving. See, the way we look at it, chocolate already dominates most of your major food-preparation holidays: Easter, Christmas, what have you.
No! Come on!
Okay, all right. Let's do it. And...Action!
I thought it was toner.
Ah, it's not so much you, you were fat, you had your own problems. But you? What a bitch!
Oh, I'm Ronni. Ronni Rappelano? The mistress?
Oh, I see. Well, I'm just gonna put in a call here and we'll find out what's goin' on and straighten it out. Yeah, hi, Lori please. Hi darling. So how 'bout Joey Tribbiani for the part of the cab driver, isn't he terrific? Uh-huuuuh. Uh-huuuuh. OK, doll. Talk to you later. Yeah, you're gonna have to sleep with her.
It's so cool man, it's so, it's just 'cause being with her is so much better than like not being with her.
Move!
Can you believe how we spent our two weeks together?
You must really like... Joey... to go to all that trouble for him.
Doesn't matter.
Oh, that's why you never see pigeons at sushi bars. See, we're having fun.
Yeah! Yep.
You have three nipples?
Oh no, but when it comes to love, what does age matter?
Yeah, most of the damage is pretty mostly contained in the bedrooms.
Y'know how the garage floods every Spring?
-make the decision-
Sorry.
Oh. Thanks.
Luisa Gianetti! Lincoln High? I sat behind you guys in home room!
Yeah. I mean, I coulda done it better, but these people keep staring at me.
I am Father Kalebasous.
Well I just thought...
Huh. Oh, boy! Uhh, I-I don't wear suits to work, and I bought six of them from you.
Marcel?
Y'know what, don't be. This is not, don't be, 'cause it's not so bad.
It's okay, Rachel knows.
If you're talking about feminism, I think you're right.
Anyway, she burned all of my clothes. I got away with two things. This suit and what turned out to be a skirt.
Yeah, sure. Good luck!
Or your keys.
What?
Hello.
Hi darling.
You're right. Of course you're right.
Hi sweetie! Are you leaving?
Oh!
Rachel?
There's no way he smells, he's the only one around here with a shower in his dressing room.
I'm all done.
Things that move me. The, the shadow of a tree, a child laughing, or this lip.
...and I know I'll never miss doing it, but I gotta tell you, it's pretty cool knowing that you're making a difference in a kid's life.
Uh, absolutely, yeah, sEnd her in. Hi.
Hi!
What kind of person is allergic to lobster? I guess the kind of person that works at a library.
What's up?
Is there any entertainment there? What are people doing?
I am hurt! A plague on both your houses!
Oh, well, I'm so glad you brought him here then.
C'MON!
I just remembered, I have to do something.
-if it's a boy, Minnie if it's a girl.
Okay. I didn't know he was here.
Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine.
What, wait, you mean like this?
Ross, let me show you where the guest room is.
No, bribes.
And Action!
Okay look, Ross, just so you know that since Lizzie likes you so much, I've decided to accept the fact that you're going out with her.
Presenting the award for Favorite Returning Male Character is McKensize...
"Hi, this is Richard. Please, leave a message at the tone."
Oh.
I invested in this night-club and it's opening tonight, would you like to come?
Okay, listen, I really like you. Okay? I think this can go somewhere. So what if I'm close to my family, are you gonna let that stand in the way of us?
Oh, one other thing. Hoshi thinks that you being ringside may have affected my concentration.
Oh my God, I think I'm gonna cry!
Hello, there. I'm Dr. Carlin. I see someone's having an allergic reaction.
Oh shoot! Maybe next time. Thanks for a lovely evening.
Oh, no-no-no, it's a good one! Fonzie plays the bongos. All right, are you ready? It's time to start pushing.
I was thinking what it would be like to kiss you.
Then we agree?
You suck!!
Sorry!
Wow umm, tell Sipowicz I'm real sorry for his loss.
Yeah?
Now, y'see, most people, when their pets pass on, they want 'em sorta laid out like they're sleeping. But occasionally you get your person who wants them in a pose. Like, chasing their tail, or, uh, jumping to catch a frisbee.
No.
Well, we had a table in college.
You wanted to see me?
Uh, no, Susan and me.
I-I can't believe this! You-you've slept with him?!
You have?
Flexible hours.
Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Yay!!
You know what your problem is? You're threatened by me.
I think it makes you look really dangerous.
They already do. That's why they call it the 'tray spot.'
Yeah. What?
You're still going to that chiropractor, that man couldn't get into medical school in Extapa!
Oh that'd be great. Sure!
So Ross was in college and decided to jump at the chance to take a young girl to her high school prom.
Get a shot of Monica. Where's Monica.
It's like I'm lookin' in a mirror. Anyway, they're called "fishtachios". They taste exactly like pistachios, but they're made primarily of reconstituted fish bits. Here, try one. You're not allergic to anything, are you?
Hey Rachel!
Oh, well we cut the trip short.
I don't know. Maybe maybe low self-esteem, maybe maybe to compensate for overshadowing a sibling, maybe you...
See you later Rach.
Ah, which ever is closest.
Maybe because you've got the keys?
Rach, are you okay?
Hey buddy, this is a family place, put the mouse back in the house.
Uhh, yeah.
So, what time is Monica supposed to get here?
Well I actually, I-I really, I haven't seen her for years. But umm, well I-I was pretty tight with-with her and her daughter.
They-they-they can smell fear.
Here we go.
Youre doing it again.
Hey!
Oh, isn't Lori a doll?
What does Rachel see in this guy? I love Rachel. I wish she was my wife.
Hmm, Lipson knows huh? Ahh, hello Mr. Opossum, enigma of the trees, upside-down denizen of the night, taunting gravity with...
It's this way? Sorry.
Don't you want to know about the sex?
Morning's here! Sunshine is here! The sky is clear, the morning's here! The morning's here!
Wow. What can I say? This doesn't make me like you any better!
All right.
Oh, thank you Phoebs. That's very sweet.
Oh. Oh my God. How can this be happening? What are we going to do?
So, I understand you're thinking of having a baby? Well, I see you're nine months pregnant. That's a good start. How you doing with your contractions?
But they're so dull, they're all opthamologists.
Hey, Phoebe.
But... Well now, now's a different time for me.
Oh, right, all right, you know what pallie I understand, consider me gone, you know what, I'll be out by the time you get home from work tomorrow.
She got a job in L.A.
By being in a box?
I can't imagine why.
Hi.
Uh, I-I-I was hoping to run into you here. I didn't know whether I should call or not, y'know I-I was only in town for a few days. And y'know, I didn't want to intrude on your life or-or anything like that, but I-I really wanted to see you and-but I didn't know if you wanted to see me.
Monica bang!
Joe, your dad's in love big time. And the worst part of it is, it's with two different women.
Hey!
Yes, what's the name, please?
You can keep saying it, but it won't stop being true.
Oh Rachel, I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to overwhelm you. It's just that, when those gates open, you... Hard to close 'em. But they are closed now. Believe me.
Pete?!
Oh, please, honey, listen, if I can do it, anybody can. You just start with half a dozen European cities, throw in thirty euphemisms for male genitalia, and bam! You have got yourself a book.
I can't believe it!
Hey, what do you want to drink?
Well of course I am!
Kidding! I'm gonna get there early, but I'm going to put you on the V.I.P list, okay? Look for me.
It's us.
That'd be great, thanks.
Nice hair. What'd ya do? Swim here?
What?
Thank you so much for coming.
Thank you. I'm going to rejoin my dinner party.
Oh, okay. Well, I'll just leave the door open and go sit on the couch.
Yeah, I know, I.
Yeah, I filled them out last night?
Oh, thank you. You're welcome.
I want to become the Ultimate Fighting Champion! It's the most intense physical competition in the world, it's banned in 49 states!
Hey!
Hi! Hey!
...and that was all before 10 o'clock. The caterer rang and said it was going to be Chicken Kiev instead of Chicken Tarragon. And then the florist phoned to say there aren't any tulips. Oh, and the chilliest has carpel-tunel syndrome. We're not gonna be...
I knew you'd understand.
My joke wasn't funny.
Hey. They're just trying to decide somehting.
Come on in.
Nooo. Uh-huh, no way. What? No.
Look, the only who stands to get hurt is me. And I'm okay with that.
Hey!
No kidding.
So is there like a story or do they just stard doing it right. . . oh, never mind.
I'm sorry.
Actually we're out of the lobster ravioli.
It's about your monkey. It's alive.
You do?! Wait, I like umm, the Beetles.
Nope.
Anytime you're ready.
Would ya care to venture one?
Oh yeah-yeah, we should get the... So when Jessica kisses a man, she usually puts umm, both her hands on the man's face.
Aw, no problem dude. Y'know we got to look out for each other. We're the same, you and me.
I love this artichoke thing! Oh, don't tell me what's in it, the diet starts tomorrow!
Ehh, y'know after high school, you just kinda lose touch. Oh yeah! I ran into Richard Dorfman.
Yeah.
Why?! Why?! He said he'd call. Why hasn't he called?
Me too.
Well, I think I'll go and unpack.
Ross play rugby? I don't think so.
Are you okay?
Actually, I'm not buying. I'm selling. Let me ask you one question. Do your friends ever have a conversation and you just nod along even though you're not really sure what they're talking about?
I'll see you tomorrow.
Are you guys ready?
Hey! What's going on?
What do you think?
That's weird.
Aren't you going to swallow that?
Right... Oh, I got something for you, too.
No, no, I don't want to forget it.
Phoebe, I-I-I-umm, Oops. I just, I-I-I-I don't, I don't know what to say. I just can't believe that you're my daughter, you're so pretty.
I'll take a look at him.
Then I made the mistake of turning off the TV, I never got it back again. And I'm sad.
It's, uh, it's Paul.
I know a great little place.
I'm not on the list!
And I'm his friend, Dr.Rosen.
Hi!
Is everything all right, dear?
I know you did, cookie. Oh, I know you did. So tell me. Did you see her?
No. Nothing. Imagine, if she had just stepped off that curb a few seconds later.
Oh, I love them. Each one's like a little party in my uterus.
If it's not a right angle, it is a wrong angle.
You don't need to fill these silences.
Hey!
I'm Mrs. Dr. Barry Hunter hyphen Farber.
Breathe, breathe, breathe.
Cut! Alex, remember you're supposed to cry. Can you cry for us this time?
Who are you?
Hey Danny.
There's nothing to discuss. We're not paying for your wine cellar.
Yeah, me too. So, I guess this is it.
Hi!
Sure I do.
Keep on scooching.
If you want it to be.
Rachel, you didn't tell me your boyfriend smoked.
Could we see something in a slimmer heel?
I'd love to, but my lawyer said I can't do that anymore.
Alright, turn around. Time to see you from behind.
He's out banging other women over the head with a club, while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet!
How's my Bing-a-ling?
Hi.
It would be nice after hearing 20,000 people chant "You suck!"
What is this? Who put a twenty down here? Huh?
Yeah, a slice of cheesecake and-and a date if you're given' 'em out.
Alright we're back! Ten seconds left here we go! Ten! Nine! Eight! Seven!
Bye guys.
That's because they are.
Oh that's cool, I was gonna fire you anyway.
Okay, I'm afraid to say this, but let's pick it up where we left off.
Oh!
But like how?
You're no Brown Bird, I can see you through my peephole.
Hey! Paul! Hi! The Wine Guy! Hey!
Oh it's nothing, it just says that you can't sue the city if you scrap your knee or y'know, get your head blown off.
Do I know you?
Fight.
Oh no.
Really?!
Joey, well thank you. That is so sweet. Oh, excuse me.
This couch belongs to us.
Oh my God, I'm married!
I'm sorry Joey, as long as he's here and he's conscious we're still shooting.
Let's get you into wardrobe for a fitting.
Here you go.
Anyway, that's when me and my friends started this whole fruit basket business. We call ourselves 'The Three Basketeers.'
Yes, we certainly do, it's going to be...
I'll see you after work sweetie.
What?
Uh-oh.
And we're dancing. A-five, six, seven, eight...
Thank you Richard, I appreciate the support.
I'm really sorry but I may be a little while longer.
No, no-no, no-no, my point is that I kept coming back because, I wanted to see you.
Come on. I'll let you lead.
Yep. Yep, that's what I didn't want to know.
I'm sorry, who are you?
Yeah, the list that-of people we're allowed to sleep...
Gloves?
Dennis.
I know I'm no John Bon Jovi, or someone who find attractive, I'm just, I think, y'know, that you might end up feeling differently.
Come on! Speech!
Oh, I totally agree.
Oh, thanks.
Oh, oh, I thought we were just talking.
Yeah. Yeah, I'll have a cup of coffee.
Nice car!
Sure.
Oh yeah! We went to the Knicks game.
We're very sad that it didn't work out between you and Emily, monkey. But, I think you're absolutely delicious.
Oh, don't worry I have plenty of sun block, it's SPF-30.
It was you?
Hi! Remember me?
Oh! You know what I need?
That's my wife!!! Get out!
Yes...
Yeah, no we're not thirty. We're 31. Okay.
Wait Joey! You didn't need to come down because the director saw your tape from yesterday and loved it.
Rudolph, the red-nosed reindeer...
I was gonna say...
Well then I guess then I-I would I would have to say C.
Yeah, but, I don't do that anymore. I got kinda sick of it, and then I couldn't come up with anything good, so they fired me.

Well, you were fired.
Yeah. Ooh, I know what this is missing! Alcohol!
Oh. No, no, he is so smart. He'll figure it out. Do you want some chicken?
Ross, they are killing you out there!
It's lame, I know. But I'm a goal-oriented person, very eager to learn...
We're actually at the end of one of our research cycles, so we're not looking for applicants right now.
So based on your petition you are seeking an annulment on the grounds that Mr. Geller is mentally unstable.
Oh-ho, I think it's nice.
Yeah, it's not like I don't have a sense of humor, huh? Hell, I even enjoy a naughty limerick now and then. But there's a time and a place, huh?! Unless you uh, have a limerick right now? No? Okay, well uh, you've got my fax number.
Mushroom. Smile. They won't all be like this. Some women might even stay through dinner. Sorry, that's not funny
Yeah. I can just go home and get back at him by myself.
Actually, I tried to call to you. You didn't need to come down here today.
Well, this all looks good.
Yeah!
It's not a game Ross, a woman died on my table today.
We agreed on Minnie.
Ewww!
Well, the guy's worked here for 25 years.
Wh..
Okay. Have you started having contractions?
Oh.... my.... God.
Can anyone else name a well known seed that's been masquerading as a nut?
You are falling fast asleep. Deeper. Deeper. Deeper. You are now completely asleep. You don't need to smoke. Cigarettes don't control you. You are a strong, confident woman, who does not need to smoke. A strong, confident woman.
Oh great!
All right, that's it. I want both of you out.
October 25th.
Well, I would like to propose a toast to the woman, who in one year from today, become Mrs. Dr. Barry Farber DDS
That was...so good.
You too, sir.
Oh crap!
M-Me again?
It's just not really who I am. Y'know, I've always been happier when...Why am I telling you this? You don't care about this stuff.
Oh.
Oh, so did I.
Sweethart, but none of that matters if it's too soon for you. It's fine! We don't have to move in together. I just-I want you to be happy
You by the door. In or out?
Yeah! That would be great!
How did you know there was a but?
All right.
Ohhhhh!
Amen!
Rachel?
All right. Well, there you go. Stop it, stop it, stop it.
Absolutely!
Okay.
Hey!
Yeah.
Okay.
Goat cheese, water chestnuts, and panchetta.
If kids is what I takes to be with you then kids it is.
There's something I never told you Amber. I'm actually your half- brother.
Is that an expensive blouse?
Hey lady. Hey wait up. How do you know my dad?
Oh, okay, I get it.
No, no, there's no rush or anything.
Tell me about it!
Is it yours? Ha! You wish, Chandler Bing. You are looking at a married lady now.
No! Why?
A surfer.
Take thee Ross...
Oh, all she said was that I remind her too much of somebody. You have any idea who she's talking about?
I was her accountant four years ago.
Mmmmmm... Oh, Joey, Joey, Joey... I think I blacked out there for a minute!
Can't have?! Excuse me, the only thing I can't have is dairy!
All right, Carol, I need you to keep pushing. I need Excuse me, could I have this?
Yeah, sure.
Oh well thank you. Such a gentleman. Thank you. Ahh, it all looks so nice, so festive, all the balloons... The funniest thing happened to me on the way here. I was...

So glad you brought someone.
All right, there was none. Let's talk signing. You be noisy girl number one, you be noisy girl number two.
Hello. Hello.
Oh! What about, what about the girls?
Oh, a 16-hour sit-in for Greenpeace.
Which do I like?
Just tell me the truth.
Hi, its us.
Y'know, I know you're talking, but all I hear is, "Blah. Blah. Blah-blah-blah."
Yeah, show it. Show it. The nubbin, the nubbin, the nubbin.
Wooooo!!!!
We're gonna give it another try.
I'm okay. I gotta go down to the police station and look at mug shots.
Yay!!
Honey, it isn't good luck.
I'm sorry... I'm sorry, God, I am so sorry, I'm an idiot, I was weak, I couldn't help myself! Whatever I did, I only did because I love you so much!
So, would you like any dessert?
No, no?
Rachel, Rachel, sweetheart. You're a terrible, terrible waitress. Really, really awful.
Do you want to ride around town on my little pink bicycle?
All right, honey, time to start pushing.
Listen to me. If you think sleeping with Ralph is going to get you my job. You are sadly mistaken.
I ah, I work at Bloomingdale's and I might know of a job possibility if your, if your interested?
How does it happen?

Okay, it'll take just a little while to prepare the embryos.
Oh no.
Okay, errrr, Monica?
Bye.
Y'know, thanks for trying to cheer me up, but I'm not gonna date some random guy from your work.
Let it go, Ross.
I know that.
Well, you're just going to say no again but...gay porn.
What?
Y'know, you look nothing like I would've thought. You're...you're so young.
Hi, this is Heldi from the Morgan Chase museum. I'm calling for Monica Geller.
Just hearing you describe it as forbidden, it's really hot.
You kids ready?
Yes, you said that.
Hi, I'm Maria.
Look, he's a really great guy and I know that you really want this to work out, but I just don't see this having a future.
Thanks, any suggestions?
Oh, she just graduated, and she wants to be something in cooking, or food, or.... I don't know. Anyway, I told her you had a restaurant-
I'm sorry Rachel, I'm sorry...
G'bye, everybody.
What're you doing?
Fine. I don't like you!!
I was wondering if I could talk to you for a moment?
Her name's Debra.
Are you all right?
Joey!!! Happy Birthday!!
But, he told me over the phone.
Whoa!!
Yeah.
You're our third call tonight.
Good morning.
No-no, it was! She was in Sex Toy Story 2, Lawrence of Alabia, and I got her autograph! The guys at the comic book store aren't gonna believe this!
Were you following me?
Yeah, OK.
Oh!
Night-night Bing-a-ling.
Okay.
Hey, lovely! Come, talk to me a minute!
Horrible!
Well, there's my favorite client. So tell me darling, how was the audition?
