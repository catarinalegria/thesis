So anyway I just didn't know where to go, and I know that you and I have kinda drifted apart, but you're the only person I knew who lived here in the city.</td>\n","      <td id=\"T_379cc_row14_col1\" class=\"data row14 col1\" > I think we are getting a little ahead of selves here. Okay. Okay. I am just going to get up, go to work and not think about him all day. Or else I'm just gonna get up and go to work.</td>\n","      <td id=\"T_379cc_row14_col2\" class=\"data row14 col2\" > What are you talking about? 'One woman'? That's like saying there's only one flavor of ice cream for you. Lemme tell you something, Ross. There's lots of flavors out there. There's Rocky Road, and Cookie Dough, and Bing! Cherry Vanilla. You could get 'em with Jimmies, or nuts, or whipped cream! This is the best thing that ever happened to you! You got married, you were, like, what, eight? Welcome back to the world! Grab a spoon!</td>\n","      <td id=\"T_379cc_row14_col3\" class=\"data row14 col3\" > Look, Ross, you gotta understand, between us we haven't had a relationship that has lasted longer than a Mento.   You, however have had the love of a woman for four years.   Four years of closeness and sharing at the end of which she ripped your heart out, and that is why we don't do it!  I don't think that was my point!</td>\n","      <td id=\"T_379cc_row14_col4\" class=\"data row14 col4\" > Right, you're not even getting your honeymoon, God.. No, no, although, Aruba, this time of year... talk about your-  -big lizards... Anyway, if you don't feel like being alone tonight, Joey and Chandler are coming over to help me put together my new furniture.</td>\n","      <td id=\"T_379cc_row14_col5\" class=\"data row14 col5\" > You're welcome. I remember when I first came to this city. I was fourteen. My mom had just killed herself and my step-dad was back in prison, and I got here, and I didn't know anybody. And I ended up living with this albino guy who was, like, cleaning windshields outside port authority, and then he killed himself, and then I found aromatherapy. So believe me, I know exactly how you feel.</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n"],"text/plain":["<pandas.io.formats.style.Styler at 0x1c5068e0790>"]},"execution_count":18,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["import pandas as pd\n","import numpy as np\n","\n","df = pd.DataFrame.from_dict(dict)\n","\n","# displaying the DataFrame\n","df.style"]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.11.2"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":2}
