Basically, there's the thing, and then there's the stuff after the thing.
'Cause it's always somethin', you know, like Monica's new job, or the whole Ross's birthday hoopla.
Wha--? Whoa, hey, I don't want my birthday to be the source of any kind of negative--there's gonna be a hoopla?
If it makes anybody feel better, then we can just forget the thing, and we'll just do the gift.
G-gift? The thing's not the gift?
Umm, or, maybe, I should stay away from all men.
You don't?!
No! The guy is mean. I mean really mean. I think you should stay away from him.
No, it's not just 'cause I'm jealous. I mean I'm not, I'm not, I'm not jealous, okay? It's... Look, the guy, he screamed, he actually screamed at this couple sitting in our seats.
Yeah, and at the end of the play, he, he got up y'know, and he just started like, banging his hands together!
Hey, do you believe this? Do you believe they are actually getting married?
Well thank you, you too.
Thanks.
Well sure. But I get married all the time so...
Ohh...
Pam! Oh God okay, just imagine this, "The Pam."
Y-Yeah! What-what is your wife's name?
It's Pam.
Aw-awww!
I don't think she'd like that.
What? What kind of a regatta gala starts at night?!
Don't let him in! I'm supposed to be at a regatta gala.
We'll be right there! Can't you just say it starts later?
The fake kind!
Hey, hi, I need a ladle. You got a ladle?
Yeah, because I was mad at you, not because I stopped loving you!
All right! Ross, do you think it's easy for me to see you with somebody else?
Y'know, hey! You're the one who ended it, remember?
You still love me?
Noo.
Okay uh, but before you do that. I-I, I need you to talk to me.
Thanks.
Hey! Okay, so I thought we'd start with my make up and then do my hair.
About what?
Umm... I'm never gonna getting married!
All right, well the place was closed. I'll just copy it later.
Yes.
Here she comes. Hold on, I'm gonna make your life much easier.
Or not. Uh, Rach, why don't you just move in with me?
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa, Joey!
Ok, good-bye you guys. Thanks for everything. Oh, sorry! Oh, sorry!
Well, 'cause then they'd be like my mom used to make them, you know, before she died.
Ok, three kinds of potatoes coming up.
The most unbelievable thing has happened. Underdog has just gotten away.
The balloon?
Uh, no she doesn't but I can, I can get a message to her.
Hi, hi can I help you?
Yeah, I'm looking for Phoebe, does she still live here?
Great. Uhh, just tell her her husband stopped by.
What?
Vogue! Hey, so tell me about this Jane Eyre woman.
Well, I was gonna, but I accidentally read something else.
What?
No! You should've read it yourself!
Come on Phoebe! Don't be such a goodie-goodie!
I ah, will buy and wrap all of your Christmas gifts.
For 50 bucks, you can get one book! What will it be? A? B? C?
Oh, I-I think I'm gonna stick with the V, I wanna see how this bad boy turns out.
No!
I ah... Oh! I'll squeeze you fresh orange juice every morning!
I know. I'm sorry. Look, I'll make a deal with you all right? Okay?
Oh I don't know honey. It's gonna be really late.
Oh come on, not again.
Hmm.
For every night that you're asleep before I get home from work...
Yeah! You can hook it up to your TV and you get radio!
Yeah? Wow! Y'know, that this thing has speakers in the headrest!
No. Really?
My chair heels itself.
Earl, you're not hearing me! All I'm saying is that you're not alone all right? Everybody hates the people they work with!
Ross! Phoebe's gonna be here any second, she cannot see this!
Oh no!
It's my new apothecary table!
Well why not?! She'll-she'll love it! It's the real thing! I got it at Pottery Barn.
I know you did! I bought the same one! And if she sees your table she's gonna know that I lied to her. I told her ours was an original.
You mean the mom you met in Montauk. She was a cat?!
What? What's wrong?
I just, I just have this really strong feeling that this cat is my Mother.
No, no-no, she was a human lady. This is the spirit of my Mom Lily, the one who killed herself.
Are you sure she's in the cat, or have you been taking your grandma's glycoma medicine again?
Of course they're listening to you! Everybody listens to you.
Yeah, I mean, come on Ross, no one will even notice. I mean they're probably not even listening!
They're not listening too me?
Monica you really think I should try this phasing out thing?
I think you look fine.
Wow. Wow, that's great. Great. Ok, wow, you know what.
Uh-huh.
Yeah, that way I figure, ya know, we'll be far enough away from our parents that we don't have to see them all the time but close enough that they can come over and babysit whenever we want. And yes, I know, the taxes are a little higher than, let's say, Nassau county but the school system's supposedly great.
Huh?
I'm off my break now so uh, um here you take this and um, I am gonna go pour these very nice people some coffee. Ok. Oh look at that, I don't have a pot. I don't have a pot. Well, hey, maybe I've got one at home, or in Scarsdale. Hey is that a door?
Wow! Umm, y'know, I-I would really love to, but I-I shouldn't.
Hey!
All righty, what do you say we head back to my place?
Why? Why can't the world stop turning, just for a moment? Just for us?
Isn't that a line from the show?!
You are not. You have never been able to break up with her.
So what are you doing bringing her here?! There's people here!
Don't worry about it. I'm taking care of it tonight.
Well, I don't have to break up with her this time. We're not involved! I'm going to do a pre-emptive strike! I'm going to end it with her before it starts. My ass is like frozen!
Yeah, try sticking it in the freezer for 20 minutes. I'm tellin' ya!
Oh thank you. Hey y'know, I'm so sorry to hear about you and Elizabeth.
Hey you!
Hey, come on in.
Oh, thanks. Yeah, I really thought we'd be able to make it work, but uh, I guess it just wasn't meant to be.
Yeah, love. It's a tricky business isn't it?
Well, for starters I would've said the right name at my wedding!
No, it's not better. I still don't get to see you.
Well, what-what would you do? Rach, if you were me, what-what would you do?
I can't believe this is happening.
I know.
Did we speak on the phone last night? Did you call me?
I don't know, I, I feel like I had a dream about you last night but I, I don't remember.
OK. Oh, oh, oh.
No, I stayed at Julie's last night.
Huh.
Wow! They really got you guys. Your T.V. The chairs.
Thanks, I'm set. Do you still live with your parents?
Oh yeah, but I can stay out as late as I want.
Oh yeah, your microwave. The stereo.
Aww, man, he took the five of spades!! Oh, no-no-no, here it is!
December 26th, huh maybe she's Santa Clause.
That would be great! Wait, how long is Denise gone for?
Umm, she said she'd be back December 26th.
Oh look who it is, my husband. The apple of my eye.
Okay, I got us a court date for tomorrow at 2:00 and I picked up all the forms. I'll take care of everything.
Oh really?! Then how come all your stuff is in this box?!
Great! Monica's moving!
I am not!
Okay, you guys. You guys I think I know what's going on here. Okay, you guys... STOP!! I know that, I know that you're acting mad because you think that it'll make it easier to leave. But deep down you're still really sad. Deep-deep down.
No Phoebe I am mad!
Yes, you do. When we left, you said, "got the keys."
We're waiting for you to open the door. You got the keys.
No I don't.
No I didn't. I asked, "got the ke-eys?"
No, no, no, you said, "got the keys".
Well wait a minute, what happened to Days of Our Lives?
Whatever dude, you kissed a guy.
How could this happen to me?! Yesterday I had two TV shows! Today, I got nothin'!
Uh, well they might be a little mad at me over there.
What happened?
Yeah, 'cause that's why you won't get Isabella Rosselini, geography.
So?
So, you gotta play the odds, pick somebody who's gonna be in the country like all the time.
Okay so, by melting, you meant melting.
Yeah.
So. I mean, who here does not have the time to get to know Julie?
Well, you have been in our lives for nearly two months now and we don't really know you. I mean, who is Julie? I mean, what do you like, what don't you like? We wanna hear everything.
Well, that could take a while.
I got the time to get to know Julie.
I got time.
Oops. Sorry! Well, good thing you number all of them, huh?
All right, hand me that other box of photos; that's the very last one.
Okay.
I hadn't! Photo 152 was a prototype.
Ohhhh. Honey, honey, honey, it's okay, it's okay honey. I'm gonna fix you a drink, huh? Maybe a margarita?
So uh, Pheebs, honey, how are those mood swings coming?
Pheebs, did...you want a cookie?
Thank you so much.
I haven't really had any yet.
Hey guys!
He's got this thing. And I keep telling him to go to my chiropractor...
Look, look I'm sorry. It's just that....
Ross? What's with the neck?
You're still going to that chiropractor, that man couldn't get into medical school in Extapa!
Thank you! That's what I keep saying.
No? So you're saying that if I called it, it wouldn't ring?
You stole the phone!
No I didn't!
No.
Umm, okay. But while you dial, let me show you the features of my new ringing handbag. Oh, it does work!
Oh Monica come on, y'know I don't sleep with guys on the first date!
Well y'know, we did other stuff too.
Did you two...
Matt Guire, Mark Lynn, Ben Wire...
Anymore!!
Oh, I have to go tell Monica what a wonderful brother she has!
Ross-Ross, you have no idea what this means to me! I mean, I mean I was gonna be homeless. You just saved me! You're my hero!
Hero, I uh, I don't know-well, all right.
Oh please! You're gonna say things now, aren't ya?
No. No, I won't. But I should tell you this, this exact same thing happened to my roommate Denise. She moved in with a guy who was secretly married to her and he said he didn't love her, but he really did, and it just blew up! And that's how she ended up living with me! Okay, that's a lie.
Sure. I guess. Hey, I hear you don't have to go to London. Yay!
For Stella! Remember? She's gettin' her grove back in like 20 minutes.
Yeah, I uh, totally forgot about that. You mind if I take a rain check? I'm waiting for a call from Emily.
It's not that easy, there's still a lot of relationship stuff.
Like what?
Oh, come on! You think that's gonna work on me?! I invented that!
Jill?
I'm sorry Rachel, I'm sorry...
Right! But, I am sorry.
All right, it's okay. One little setback is okay, just don't let it happen again, all right? Now since daddy paid for all this stuff, I should take it all away. But I'm just gonna take the-the pajmena. And the uh, and the uh pants. Y'know what, I'm just gonna take it all away, 'cause that way you'll just really learn the lesson. Okay? All righty, I'm gonna run a couple of errands and I will see you at dinner.
Really?! You think so? Y'know, I had just rolled out of bed.
Here it comes.
This is a great picture.
Yeah? Well you look phenomenal.
Well she should, it was taken ten years ago!
Oh no-no-no-no-no, no, no! We, you with someone and me with someone.
Yeah, I guess. I-I... I mean, do-do you think we're ever gonna have that?
You mean, we-you and me?
Oh good, you scared me for a minute.
Shake it off.
Oh God! This is silly, I'm gonna see you in a couple of hours!
Thanks.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Bye house!
'Gone for more jars. Back later. Monica Geller.'
Mon?
Mon?
Wait a minute, look.
What?
Joey, y'know that you could just not throw the sticks up in the air.
Phoebe, you got Joey drums to annoy Rachel, so she wouldn't wanna live there anymore?
Maybe on some level.
What is Rock 'n' Roll about that?
Hey, Joey, I got you another present.
Oh, god, I can't believe one of us actually has one of these.
Susan, he looks just like you.
Thanks.
I know, I still am one of these.
Ross, can I?
Don't let him in! I'm supposed to be at a regatta gala.
Umm, yum!
It's Danny.
We'll be right there! Can't you just say it starts later?
What? What kind of a regatta gala starts at night?!
Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me, excuse me, sorry. Hi.
I forgot... I am supposed to pick up a friend at the airport. I am so sorry! I'm so... if you want to stay, and finish your drinks, please do.... I meanI'm sorry. I-I-I gotta go. I'm sorry.
But...
For God's sake, will you let it go? There's no Rachel!
Oh, hey, hey, I got that.
Oh, I'm sorry, were you speaking to me or sleeping with someone else?
All right, let's go!
You're welcome.
We were on a break!
Y'know Ross why don't you put that on your answering machine!
Oh, well, actually we were just talking about me not going to Ross's wedding.
Wow, you seem to be doing so much better. That's great. So how-how are things going?
Good. Y'know-no-no, okay, it's-it feels like everything's been about me lately, so what's happening with you?
Oh!
It just might be too hard, given the history and all that...
Ohh, thank you for my beautiul earrings, they're perfect. I love you.
Ohh, thank you for the wonderful dinner.
Thanks for being born.
Oh, now you can exchange them if you want, ok.
Now I love you even more.
Guys! Guess what, guess what, guess what, guess what!
Hi!
Hey.
Um, ok... the... the fifth dentist caved and now they're all recommending Trident?
Noooo... the interview! She loved me! She absolutely loved me. We talked for like two and a half hours, we have the same taste in clothes, andoh, I went to camp with her cousin... And, oh, the job is perfect. I can do this. I can do this well!
Well umm, maybe we could uhh... Ah-ha! Too slow!!
Oh hey-hey wait! How do we fairly decide who gets the phone?
I don't know.
Ah-ha! Too cocky!
I'm going to keep dating him Mother, and there's nothing you can do about it!
Oh my God, I'm starting to look like my great aunt, Muriel.
That's okay.
But you haven't even heard the chorus!
All right. Y'know what? We don't have to go downstairs! We can bring Vegas up to us! All right, come on, come on, we'll play some blackjack. Here we go. 13.
Hit me!
...I just don't know if the world is ready for you and your bag.
Honey wait, Joey, I'm sorry I mean as terrific as I think you are with it...
Oh, hey!
I can't believe I'm hearing this!
Wait a minute! Wait a minute! I'm not saying that you shouldn't have a bag, I just-it's just there are other bags that are a little less umm, controversial.
Hello?! Oh, yeah! This is gonna be a while. Excuse me. Yeah!
I'd love to!
What?
My God!
Oh, I'm sorry. Is that annoying? And speaking about being selfish in bed, how's Whitney?
Fancy soap? I thought we were savin' that for the Pope!
Here, let me show you. Okay, the towels are hanging next to the sink, and umm, you can use the fancy soap.
Thank you.
See he's nice. Right?
Yeah, but Monica, do you actually want to be in a relationship where you can actually use the phrase, "That's not how your dad used to do it."
Oh, I win! He's got Barney's on his speed dial.
Yes okay. Well now see this isn't telling us anything. Joe. Carlos. Peter. Ooh! Peter Luger! T hat's a steak house!
Okay, a meat eater. Fine, that's one for you.
So you don't know that's Barney's the store! That can be y'know his friend's house, or a bar. Who has Barney's the store on their speed dial?
His new girlfriend!
I see your fifty cents... and I raise you... five dollars.
Call.
I'm in.
I thought, uh... it was a fifty cent limit.
Well, I just lost a job, and I'd like to raise the bet five bucks. Does anybody have a problem with that?
I'm sorry, they were just all coming at me, and I didn't know what to do.
I'm so sorry! Are you okay?
No! I'm not okay!
Thirty seconds left on the timer!
Okay, okay, so we get to take that stupid troll thing home!
You are. Well, um... We, we, we were just... Wow!
Ross?
I'm here.
What? Great, now I'm having a baby.
What?
Okay-okay-okay! So, making things. That sounds like so much fun.
You guys!
You can't make crotchless panties? You take, you take a pair of scissors and you just cut...
Yeah, I thought so to until I paper mached one of my eyes shut.
Oh, I love paper mache! What did you make?
Ross honey, this is very nice, but, but I-I got a crisis.
Well you said you couldn't go out so....
You brought a picnic, oh, what a boyfriend. That's it, on Monday I start wearing make-up.
Yeah, but I got cous-cous!
Honey, honey, I'm sorry, I know it's our anniversary but I told you on the phone I don't have time to stop.
Ross, it took you ten years to finally admit you liked me.
Oh-oh, you lie.
What you don't think I'd go up to her?
Yeah, well missy, you better be glad that list is laminated.
You know what honey, you go ahead, we'll call her an alternate.
No, no, no.... the, um, the... 'love' part?
What did you just say?
ahem... um... Crystal duck.
F-hah.... flennin....
Oh.... my God.
Yeah! Ohh, I've been waitin' so long to get on that body!
That's right, I wanna do it with you! I've been trying to fight it, but you just said all the right things.
I-I-I-I did?
This body?
Yeah that's right! Come on Joey; sex me up!
Kind of ditzy? Too into her looks? Spoiled?
Good luck.
Ok, just, just remember how crazy I am about you, ok?
Now that's a little spoiled. He was supposed to type "little", the idiot.
Just a waitress?
Yeah, maybe if you gave this girl a chance it would go somewhere.
My beers?! Look you guys, she's a very nice girl. Okay? We had a good time, but I just-I don't see it going anywhere.
Yeah, but you always say that.
Look I'm sorry you guys, I-I just don't think so.
Whatever.
Ohh wow! I'm sorry, but Ross you kicked off your shoes!
Noo!! No! You thought, you actually thought I wanted to have sex with you?!
No! No! No! No-no-no-no.
Can we, can we just forget this ever happened?
Yes of course, absolutely! You're right. I'm sorry.
Oh Daddy, no he didn't mean anything by that, he really didn't.
I know.
Excuse me, you think I'm cheap?
Nothing I do means anything, really.
This is nice. I pay two hundred dollars for dinner, you put down twenty, and you come out looking like Mr. Big Shot. You really want to be Mr. Big Shot? Here, I'll tell you what, you pay the whole bill, Mr. Big Shot, all right.
So ah, did you have fun at the bachelor party last night?
People, people, people.
Let's try it again, and this time let's watch everybody watch Joey. Show 'em how it's done. Count it off.
Oh yeah, yeah! Look what I got, look what I got. See, she's fully dressed, right?
Right.
No, no, no, no turtles scare me. I don't need that today.
Thank you, thank you, thank you, Pheebs.
Your welcome, oh please not the one with the turtles.
Honey, just relax, it's gonna be fine. Hey, umm,. why don't I come down there and I'll take you out to lunch?
Oh honey, thank you, but Mark's taking me out.
Oh my God, Melissa Warburton. I don't think I have the energy for this.
Oh umm, uh we don't sell cigarettes, but they have them at the newsstand across the street.
That'd be great, thanks.
Oh my God! Ray-ray Green?!
Melissa!
Hey, did you guys check out those new hand-dryers in the bathroom?
Hey.
That was gonna be my opener.
I thought that was just a rumour.
True story.
Well you uh, you were always really good at the uh, at the uh the stuff.
Yeah, just give me a minute! Oh well, yes, I can think of one good thing.
What?
Yeah? I was good at the stuff huh?
Uh-hmm, uh-hmm, yeah, yeah, I really liked your hands.
Excuse me! But this is a purebred, show-quality Sphinx cat!
Yes it is!
Why is it inside out?!
How much did you pay for that?
Well, it was a little extravagant, but I a pretty good deal.
Oh God... Okay. Alright. Alright. Okay. Ross, please don't hate me.
Oh God, Ross, I cannot do this.
Okay, quick and painful.
Oh, what? What-what?
Y'know Marcel?
Come on! Serious-ser-ser-seriously, what did she mean by that? Especially you!
What do you think Monica mean when she said she didn't want to talk, especially with me? I mean, why not especially you and me? We were both out there kissing.
Still thinking about it huh?
Oh, who cares?
I care!
Well in High School, that added up to head cheerleader.
Come on Ross give me the keys! Monica does not know what she's talking about! I am an excellent driver!
You're fast and irresponsible. That adds up to a bad driver.
Did you see the look that girl just gave me? Huh? She must've seen me cruising in the bad boy.
I think she's checking out your beehive Ross.
Well, have you been involved with someone where you haven't broken up?
If we broke up, and I lost you...
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What makes you think we're gonna break up?
No. But... it only has to happen once. Look, you and I both know we are perfect for each other, right? I mean... so, the only question is... are you attracted to me?
I don't know... I mean, I've never looked at you that way before.
Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh Chandler!! You guys are gonna be so happy!
Ugh! No more crying! Please! I just dumped one cry baby, I'll dump you too!
I'm gonna ask Monica to marry me.
I know.
Where's all the tissues?!
I mean do you have any fun, you know, fantasy type things?
Well honey, what about you?
What?
No.
Come on you gotta have one!
Central Perk is proud to present Miss Phoebe Buffay.
I cannot believe we're having this conversation.
C'mon! Just try to picture her not pregnant, that's all.
Thanks. Hi, um, 'kay. I'd like to start with a song that's about a man that I recently met, who's, um, come to be very important to me. 'Kay.
You don't have to be awake to be my man, As long as you have brainwaves I'll be there to hold your hand. Though we just met the other day, There's something I have got to say...
Ohh, out, oh God, I don't know why we didn't think to check there!
Oh my God! Where the hell have you been?!!
Just, y'know out.
What were you doing?
I uh, went to a bar. And then I just uh, just walked around for a while.
No! Come on its late, we're not gonna go down to the office.
Or maybe you would see me looking embarrassed because you are talking on the phone with your crotch!
You wanna go down to the office right now?
Okay I understand. I wouldn't want to be proved wrong either.
Okay get your coat! Oh! When did you unhook this? Nice work!
Wow! It looks like the Easter Bunny's funeral in here.
Hey!
Oh.
Come on, come on, we're-we're-we're lighting the candles!
Oh.
Oh does it matter?! All that matters is that you look so handsome.
Well y'know what they say, the 23rd time's the charm. Aww, look at you all handsome!
Whose is it?
Whose is it?
I don't want to say.
I don't know, I don't know. Urrrgh! Look, maybe we should take a break.
Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight over and over again, Ross, no, you're, you're, you're making this too hard.
Oh I'm, I'm making this too hard. Okay, what do you want me to do.
Okay, okay, fine, you're right. Let's ah, let's take a break, let's cool off, okay, let's get some frozen yogart, or something..
No. A break from us.
Well hello! Welcome to Monica's. May I take your coat?
You know, Rachel, when you ran out of your wedding, I was there for you. I put a roof over your head, and if that means nothing to you... twenty dollars an hour.
Done.
Hi Steve!
Hello, Monica. Hello, greeter girl.
Oh yeah! Oh my God! That is our friend! It's Naked Ross!
Good. I'm really looking forward to you and me having sexual intercourse.
Hey-hey, check it out! Check it out! Ugly Naked Guy has a naked friend!
Yeah, it is! Naked Ross!!
Show time!
Well, it's a long story, but umm I broke Joey's chair...
I just purchased the La-Z-Boy E-cliner 3000.
That's awesome! That's great! What made you do it?!
Whoa-whoa-whoa! You broke Joey's chair?
Yeah.
Wait-wait-wait, I just thought of another story about how nice Ross is!
I like Ross.
Ohhh! Kids!
That's okay Rach, we're not liking Ross right now.
Oh! I've got a lot of those too!
No, it was on the house, it was, it was a newlywed special.
I know. I always thought if you and I got married, it would be the one that stuck. And it wouldn't be a secret, and we wouldn't have our wedding dinner at Pizza Hut.
Did I, did I even treat?
That may be the most depressing thing I've heard in my life. I should probably get these to my lawyer's office.
Hey, thanks Ross, for taking care of all of this.
Hi! Well, we were just about to take off and see a movie. Oh no!
Erin.
Hey Rachel.
What's wrong?
Oh Phoebe, we forgot that party we have to go to.
No because first they arrest the guy and then they try him.
I am so proud of Joey, I can't believe he's going to be on Law & Order!
I know. But don't you think that it should be called Order and Law?
Don't get me started on that.
I was not flirting.
Well, you ripped the paper out of the court reporter's machine!!
This is totally your fault!
My fault?! You threatened the judge!
That was the only way I could get him to stop typing!
Hi! How are the Gellers?
Oh, I probably shouldn't-so I will! Oh! Wow! It's like it's raining!
Pat the dog. Oh! Oh! I get it!!
Do you uh, do you-ready for a refill?
Pretty cool, huh? But if you're thinking you can put a fish in there and it wouldn't get sucked up into the mechanism, well you'd be wrong.
Umm, can I use your bathroom?
Well then let's just quit! We'll just quit! Let's all quit!
Oh sure, every Sunday night I'm telling myself I'm quitting but every Monday morning it's like
Tell me about it!
It does sound appealing.
Oh, I never could do it.
That's fine. So Monica, you are now in control of my love life.
Oh... No, I did that for someone once and I'm not comfortable having that kind of power and control over someone's life.
I'll do it!
Okay, I gotta go to work.
And uh, Rachel, glad to have you back.
Okay honey, you do realize she only spins like that on ice.
All right let me see. Uma Thurman, Winona Ryder, Elizabeth Hurely, Michelle Pfieffer, and Dorothy Hammel?
Hey, it's my list.
Ow!-Ow!-Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Y'know, ow!
Hey!-Hey! What's going on?
Yeah it is, it is. We really, really have to do something about that.
What is this? Who put a twenty down here? Huh?
Oh, yeah, that would be me, um, I have, I have a problem I-I tip way too much, way, way, too much, it's a sickness really.
I know.
Excuse me, you think I'm cheap?
Wow, Monica, you look just like your grandmother. How old was she there?
Got me.
Oh, that's Nana, right there in the middle. 'Me and the gang at Java Joe's'.
Let's see, 1939... yeah, 24, 25?
Looks like a fun gang.
Well, I don't get it, but she wanted me to give you her phone number.
Hey Ross? Umm, I just ran into Caitlin in the hallway and-and uh, you must be getting better at this flirting stuff than I thought.
What do you mean?
And she just gave you this?
Yeah!
Y'know, I gotta tell ya, this really does put in a better mood.
Hey, y'know what might cheer you up?
What?
Oh, I wish there was a job where I could wear this all the time. Maybe someday, there will be.
Oh God! He's gonna come by and borrow some candles for his big date!
What, as part of your poor friends outreach program?
Oh! I can't believe it. I can't believe this. We're just like, sitting at home, trying to guess Joey's fingers, and you guys are out like partying and having fun, and you know, all, "hey, Blowfish, suck on my neck".
Look, don't blame us. You guys coulda been there, you know.
It's work.
I don't know what to say. I'm sorry that we make more money than you. But we're not gonna feel guilty about it. We work really hard for it.
Y'know, I gotta tell ya, I just loved your look when you were bald.
Ohh-ha-ha!
I think I brought back half of the beach in my hair. It was so much easier when I used to shave my head.
Really?!
Ohh!
Yeah I know, and I bet you thought it would be weird. But it's not!
Rachel.
Rachel! Well, you-you're not at home, you're-you're-you're right here.
Okay. So well I'll umm, I'll have her home by midnight.
Why aren't you home yet?!
Oh, that is so sweet. I think I'm falling in love with you all over again.
God! And to have to hear about it from Gunther!!
Come on! Like I wanted him to tell you, I ran all over the place trying to make sure that didn't happen!
Y'know what, I think we can go out there. I mean they have more important things to worry about.
Yeah, we'll be fine.
Umm, when were you gonna tell me that you're going out with Chip Matthews?
Let it go!!
Hey!
Now? Is it okay if I go out with Chip Matthews?
Nooo! It's not okay! I can't believe you would want to after what he did to me!
All right fine! You're not invited to the party we're gonna have either.
Nooo!
Then you're not invited.
Oh-whoa, what party?
Well umm...
Ohh, he's married! Ross is married. I can't-I still can't believe it.
Pheebs! Always a pleasure.
Oh, Rachel, sweetie, look, here's a really cute picture of Joey and you at the reception.
Honey, sweetie, by the edges.
I mean, y'know I'm just gonna have to accept it ...
Joey, is what she just said umm-Oh my God. You were actually gonna...
I can't believe you thought that you were going to video tape us having sex on the first date!
Hiya.
What is going on here?
And with Chandler in the next room. What are you, what are you sick?
Yeah, sure. All right, whose court is the ball in now?
Oh well, y'know, the gala had to end sometime.
Don't go anywhere, I'll be right back.
I thought there wasn't a ball?
Oh, come on! He's glad that I came, he doesn't want me to go anywhere, balls flying all over the place!
You know what honey, you go ahead, we'll call her an alternate.
Ross, it took you ten years to finally admit you liked me.
Yeah, well missy, you better be glad that list is laminated.
Okay, hold my crawler.
Okay.
Oh yeah. I used to babysit him. Hey, how's his dad?
Oh, well, it pretty much sucked. How was yours?
Yeah, ours pretty much sucked, oh, but, I did run into little Stevie Fisher. Remember him?
Uh, good.
Uh, aside from that, the whole evening was pretty much a bust.
Oh that's right! I'm sorry! I-I am early! Finish! Please!!
Ohh! My God! Barry!!
You-you-you said you were gonna be away all weekend!
Surprise! Look who's back!
Hey Pheebs!
Monica, why? Why would I ever want to take away from your night?
Uh, Rachel, I've been thinking. I don't think us getting together tonight is such a good idea. I'm calling it off.
Why to save your dignity my man.
I don't know! I don't-maybe you're feeling a little resentful. Maybe ah, maybe you thought you'd get married first! Maybe you can't stand the fact that your formally fat friend is getting married before you!
Oh wow. That-y'know what? That is so unfair. Y'know what? Now I want to steal your thunder! Come on Ross, let's go have sex!
Well, y'know he lost his keys so he was looking for them...
I'll call you later. Bye Ross.
What-what-what the-how da-how did-what the-how did-what?!
In your mouth?!
No! Downstairs! And we got to talking y'know, for like two hours, and I really liked him so I invited him up here for a cup of coffee.
Wow, that's great Ross, I'm sorry we weren't more supportive before.
How'd the lecture go?
It went great! And I didn't need any jokes or naked chicks either!
I knew all I had to do was let the material speak for itself. Everyone's all, "Ross you have to be funny and sexy." Well, I proved them wrong! And now, I'm gonna pass the news onto Joey and Chandler.
That you're not funny or sexy?
Ohh-ho-hooohhh. The hair comes out, and the gloves come on.
"Indeed there isn't"... I should really get back to work.
Yeah, 'cause otherwise someone might get what they actually ordered.
Did you ever go out with a guy your friends all really like?
No.
Well, believe me, it's been a long time since I've been flung.
Hey, y'know, at least you have somebody to miss that stuff with! I hate being alone this time of year! Next thing you know it'll be Valentine's Day, then my birthday, then bang!-before you know it, they're lighting that damn tree again. Ohh, I want somebody! Y'know, I want a man!! I mean, it doesn't even have to be a big relationship, y'know, just like a fling would be great.
Really?! I didn't think girls ever just wanted a fling.
Well, I know what I'm giving you for Christmas.
Y'know what? There's some nice guys at my office, do you want me to set you up?
Yeah, right, he almost danced me right down that...garbage chute.
Well, why doesn't he practice with a girl?
Well, he's too shy, he doesn't thing he's good enough to dance with girls yet.
Oh, would you let it go already?! You're fine!
Hey.
Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. See Phoebe, Phoebe.
Yes but my mom got me this job.
OK, I can be a waitress, I can be a waitress.
Really Phoebs? Because, you know, you'd have to be an actual waitress. This can't be like your 'I can be a bear cub' thing.
I can be a waitress. OK watch this. Um, gimme two number ones, 86 the bacon, one Adam and Eve on a raft and rick'em, la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la.
How did we end up with these jerks? We're good people!
Pete the Weeper? Remember that guy who used to cry every time we had sex. "Was it good for you?"
Yeah, well, I'll take a little crying any day over Howard-the-"I-win"-guy. "I win! I win!" I went out with the guy for two monthsI didn't get to win once.
I don't know. Maybe we're some kinda magnets.
I know I am. That's why I can't wear a digital watch.
Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated?
So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped?
Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN...
Got me.
Remember when we were in high school together?
How-how did end up in Vermont with that awful witch?!
They're in Vermont!! How could this happen?!
Ow!
Maybe, she doesn't hit him all the time.
When we first met her, she was soaking, her feet were wet! Who wouldn't be miserable? I'm telling you when I got her into a dry pair of shoes, she was a totally different person.
What?! Me?! What about you and your consummated like bunnies nonsense!
Well, based on what I heard, you two certainly don't qualify for an annulment. If you two don't want to be together you'll have to file for divorce.
That's great! Are you happy now? Look what you did with your funny, funny form!
And what--What are you typing that for? Did you hear what she said? We don't get the annulment. Don't type that! What?! Stop typing! Hey! Stop typing! Stop typing! Stop typing!!
Okay, do you see, do you see what you're keeping me married too?!
Oh, there you are! Hi! Oh, so, so, how was China, you?
Oh my god. Oh my god. Excuse me. Move! Move! Emergency! Excuse me!
Rach!
It was, it was great. Oh, what happened?
What?
What? He said 'we should do it again', that's good, right?
Um, not so good. He walked me to the subway and said 'We should do this again!'
Ohh. Ouch.
Uh, no. Loosely translated 'We should do this again' means 'You will never see me naked'.
Since when?
Chandler and Monica?!! Oh, this is unbelievable!! How long have you known?
AND YOU KNOW!!!
Yeah, I know!!!!
Too long! Oh my God, Rach, I've been dying to talk to someone about this for so long! Listen, listen, we can't say anything about this to anybody, they're so weird about that! Listen...
Hey!
Ohh! I would kill for a salmon skin roll right now!
Yeah it is! It is! It's freshwater eel!
All right, maybe it means that too...
Y'know what? Fine! Get attacked! I don't even care!
Come on Ross. We're sorry. Please tell us what it is.
Oh look who it is, my husband. The apple of my eye.
Umm, she said she'd be back December 26th.
December 26th, huh maybe she's Santa Clause.
Okay, I got us a court date for tomorrow at 2:00 and I picked up all the forms. I'll take care of everything.
Well sure, if you say you're gonna take care of everything I have no reason to doubt you. Give me those forms! All right, now I'm gonna do this my way and I don't want to hear a peep out of you!
Well it's hard to tell... Oh God, if she would just stop moving.
Hold on a second! What is that on her ankle?
Her ankle is what you're watching?
She's just doing her job!
You sick bastards!
Ohhh... Okay, you were right. You were right! This was just not worth it.
What?
We forgot to sign one of the admissions forms.
Thank you.
Okay, let me just change.
And with Chandler in the next room. What are you, what are you sick?
Joey, is what she just said umm-Oh my God. You were actually gonna...
What is going on here?
I'm Joey. I mean, I'm disgusting. I make low-budget adult films.
You guys promised you'd be more careful! I mean, come on! The good Joey name is being dragged through the mud here!
What? It's true, my right leg is two inches shorter.
Oh God!
Argue with that.
Come on! You're just titling! Her legs are fine!
I know that!
All right honey, we'd better go if we wanna catch that movie.
Your work makes me sad.
Oh man! I want that place so much!! I was so sure that was gonna work! There's twelve bucks I'll never see again!
Bye!
Bye!
All right, fine! But I had too! I had to do it for my career!
I did not!
Yes you did! You look happy and sick; you smoked!
I wish I had smoked for my career...
That's so gross!
No, no, no, wait! Okay, okay. Don't! I'll go, I'll go!
Oh, wait, let me get you another glass. That's been sitting out.
I think this will be fine. Okay, vanilla milkshake, just a vanilla milkshake, with chicken bits floating in it. Cheers.
You will?!
You were really gonna do that, weren't you?
You may need to use this year to teach Ben about Phoebe.
Nope. I mean, I know Susan does every year, but I think I wanna take this year to teach him all about Hanukkah.
And maybe I could teach Ben about the Christmas skull and how people die.
Hmm.
Hey.
Okay, then y'know what? Help me! I need help! I can't do this!
Okay.
Not even close.
Okay! All right! Let's do it!
All right!
Yeah? Well, you should know. You've bought like a billion of 'em.
Well, she walked in when I was looking at the ring brochures. You can understand that, right? Guys? Guys?
God that is the most beautiful engagement ring ever!
Yeah, you didn't get one.
Okay, well tonight's the big night.
Yeah, remember that thing I told you that happened yesterday? Well it didn't happen.
Ohh, hi, Kim.
Hi Rachel.
You didn't cancel the fabric order from Taiwan?
Okay, two things didn't happen. Remember I told you that someone made out with Ralph Lauren in the copy room? Well, it turns out that's not true.
Ok, I've got one. Wow, those things almost never come true.
Ok, that's enough.
Ok Rachel, make a special flan wish.
Ok, Chandler, Mon, there's only one bananna nut muffin left.
Oh, I ordered mine first.
Yes! And he said really mean things that were only partly true.
God! If you're gonna cry about it!
Whoa-whoa, Treeger made you cry?
I'm gonna go down there and teach that guy a lesson.
Joey, please don't do that. I think it's best that we just forget about it.
Oh my God!! Do it!! Honey, you've waited long enough!!
Yeah, I heard it.
It's not like, I haven't any opportunities. I mean, y'know, I'm just waiting for the perfect guy. I'm seeing this guy Roger, all right? He's not perfect, but umm, I think maybe I should just get it over with. Y'know, give him my flower.
Y'know what? You are right?!
Yes!! I mean sex does not have to be a big deal! There shouldn't be all this rules and restrictions! Y'know, people should be able to sleep with who ever they want, whenever...
Yeah fun? Great! So uh, so did you guys hit it off?
I'll take a coffee. So how was your big date last night?
Uhh, it was okay. Yeah, it was fun.
I guess so.
So uh, so did anything happen? Because rumor has it you guys shut the drapes!
Come on apartment! Come on apartment! Oh! I know queen is high!
All right, cut, let's pick again, pick again.
Okay.
Uh-huh, not as high as... It worked! King!
Yeah baby!
Honey, listen, y'know what? The nurse said the doctor is wonderful.
Look, Pheebs-Pheebs, it's gonna be okay.
That's easy for you to say, I don't see three kids coming out your vagina!
Yeah, he's head of the department.
All right-Ooh! Oh dead God, save me!
Yeah, he thought he broke your chair so he switched the chairs!
Joey you broke my chair!!
Your chair?!
So, there was no miracle?!
No Joe, no miracle.
Oh my God, what a great surprise! This is such a beautiful house.
Why don't you get in the hot tub and I'll meet you there.
Ohh, okay.
Thank you, it's my mom's. So this is the kitchen.
You've reached Monica and Chandler's, if you're listening to this message, we're probably screening. Yeah we are.
What-what, wait a minute, you don't think that's why he wants me back?
Yes!
I bet that kiss isn't looking like such a big mistake now, is it?
Yeah! No?
A kiss? What are you talking about?
Pheebs is your grandmother maybe saying that you should live here alone?
Oh yeah? Startin' to feel her again there are we?
A little bit, yeah.
You heard her too?! You have the gift!
Phoebe, it's okay. I like living with Joey.
That was surreal. Okay, what do think? Are you interested at all?
Okay, my boss, Joanna, when you left, she started asking questions about you...
Oh-ho, liked what she saw, huh? Dug my action, did she? Checkin' out the Chan-Chan man!
Yeah, she seemed cool, attractive. I'll do it.
Oh thank you, Chandler, this is so great, she's gonna love me.
Monica, what is so amazing? I gave up, like, everything. And for what?
C'mon, sit. Just sit down, sit.
You should feel great about yourself! You're doing this amazing independence thing!
You are just like Jack.
...Jack from downstairs?
Okay, that doesn't help me, because we went to the same high school.
I mean why, of all people would you want to go out with Chip?!
Look, you and I went to different high schools...
You went to one where you were popular, and you got to ride off Chip's motorcycle, and wear his letterman jacket. I went to one where I wore a band uniform they had to have specially made.
They had to have that specially made?!
Oh, what do you, you want me to stop seeing him, is that what you want?
Ow. Ow. Ow.
Alright, now I will let go if you both stop.
Uh-huh.
You want me to just call him up and tell him that you're seeing him instead? That's what you want?
Uh... Oh, Mindy, you are so stupid. Oh, we are both so stupid.
What?
I know. I know, and when he proposed to me, everyone said "Don't do it, he's just gonna do to you what he did to Rachel," and now I feel so stupid.
What do you mean?
Smell familiar?
No-no, they just had a big blowout over what to do with my room.
Oh thanks, but listen, I was just at Monica's and she and Chandler had a big fight and they're not moving in.
What do you mean, they're not moving in? They-they're still moving in right?
What?! Over a stupid room!
Yeah, I feel kinda bad for them, but I'm also really psyched 'cause I don't have to move in here!
Yes, his name is Barry, he's a doctor, thank you very much.
Monica! Look! Hi! What do ya think?
Oh my God, you can't even see where the Titanic hit it.
Awww, just like you always wanted. Congratulations
Thank you. So how-how 'bout you, are-are you seeing anybody?
No. No-no-no-no, no. I mean, don't do that. Not, I mean not for me.
No, not that, I mean, what about you and Mindy?
Well, if you want, I'll justI'll just break it off with her.
Dr. Farber, Bobby Rush is here for his adjustment.
Thanks, Bernice. Let's go away this weekend.
Well, I-I-I've been on Standby for a flight home for hours.
Hi!
Hi! What are you, what are you doing here?
Oh.
Ohh, so no sign of Emily huh?
Ahhh, I think you look great! That bag is gonna get you that part.
All right, let's go say good-bye.
Hey! I'm off to my audition. How do I look?
And a date with a man!
Y'know what? Make fun all you want. This is a great bag! Okay? And it's as handy as it is becoming. Now, just because you don't understand something, doesn't make it wrong. All right? So from now on you guys are gonna have to get used to the fact that Joey, comes with a bag!
I'm fourth! Look at you with your little maple syrup award!
I did, but that was really fun.
And the winner is...Joey Tribbiani! Oh... Wow! I honestly never expected this. I uh, I didn't prepare a speech. But umm, I'd like to thank my parents, who've always been there for me. I'd also like to thank my friends, Chandler, Monica, Phoebe, Rachel...
Yeah may-maybe you don't tell anyone about this.
What? No! It's not a big deal! I do that too, with my shampoo bottle.
Oh wow, uh okay, uh maybe. Umm, yes, I can do that!
Uh-huh.
No really, I mean, I mean, God, I could use a friend.
Okay!
Okay!
Oh, come on! This is crazy! Can't we just flip a coin?!
Oh uh, me and Ross can be the judges.
Well, it's better than us deciding.
No! Coins hate me!
Okay. Okay fine, y'know what? We will let Ross and Joey decide. Hiiiii, Ross! Sweetie.
No, but I was doing my thing and everything was going according to the plan!
Well, you should be, this is all your fault! You meddled in our relationship!!
You had no relationship!!
Oh God, stop with the plan! So what, so what you saw him with a girl? Who cares?! That doesn't mean anything! Now look, you're going to go out on a date with Danny and you're going to be so charming he's gonna forget all about that stupid subway girl.
She was kinda stupid. You're right. All right, I'm just gonna go on the date. I'm gonna go on the date. That is the new plan.
Hey look-look, Phoebe's talking to uh, Cute Coffeehouse Guy.
Amazing!
And those guys were this close to lettin' us play this time too.
Oh, you guys call him Cute Coffeehouse Guy, we call him Hums While He Pees.
Yes, and we call Ross Lingers In The Bathroom.
Oh, come on! I'll give you ten free Ralph Lauren shirts.
So, will you talk to him?
I don't know Rach.
One! No ten! You said ten! You can't take that back!
Hey Joey, you wanted to talk to me?
Take 'em! Joey, you can touch them! They're your underwear.
Yeah!
Yeah!
Chandler? A word.
That's it! I'm tired of covering for you two! This has got to stop! Ahh! And tighty-whiteys! What are you, 8?
Please, Ross, you-you got hurt playing badminton with my dad.
Nope. Man look at this! Ross, I can't believe you said you'd play rugby. I mean look how brutal this is!
Hey, I can handle it! All right?
That's 'cause-'cause you're mom's dog kept-kept looking at me.
Okay, Ross, look-look-look-look, look right here. That's called a scrum, okay? It's kinda like a huddle.
Hi. Well hey, you don't - you don't think they're kind of cool?
Um, a chip. A tattoo, I'm getting a tattoo.
A tattoo? Why, why would you want to do that? Hi.
No, sorry I don't. Tell me why would anyone pay someone to scar their body for life? What if it doesn't come out right Phoebe? Then it's like, I don't know, havin' a bad hair cut all the time. Why's everyone staring at me?
Ross, come sign this birthday card for dad. Rich is gonna be here any minute.
Why do you care about the guy who won the Paris trip?
Oh and uh the guy who got the Paris trip is at table four.
Oh, okay.
It's a trip for two! Excuse me. Excuse me, is the person who won the Paris trip at this table?
That was me.
Yeah and we'll drop it off downstairs so that we're not tempted.
It was cheesecake. It was fine. It had a buttery, crumbly, graham cracker crust, with a very rich yet light, cream cheese filling... Wow! My whole mouth just filled with saliva!
Y'know what? Forget it! We are just hungry! We have not had lunch! We are just light-headed! So let us go out and have lunch and forget about the cheesecake.
Good idea. Where do you want to go to lunch?
Momma's Little Bakery, Chicago, Illinois.
Well, yes, we got married in Vegas and uh, and the names I think.
Ross! Your honor, rest assured relationship ended like two years ago! And could you strike "Consummated like bunnies" from the record?
Is there, anything in this record that is actually true?
Well, based on what I heard, you two certainly don't qualify for an annulment. If you two don't want to be together you'll have to file for divorce.
That's great! Are you happy now? Look what you did with your funny, funny form!
Oh, and somebody can get those leather pants she's always wanted!
Oh my God! We are throwing the most depressing baby shower ever!
Wait a minute! Unless, we give her all gifts she can use after she's done being pregnant. Like-like umm, regular coffee, Tequila.
Oh, she's gonna love that!
What the hell is this?! What, did you actually thought it would make me feel better to give me stuff that I can't use for another two months?! This sucks! All right, what's my next present?!
Oh. Hi. We just found this cat and we're looking for the owner.
You know, on second thought, gum would be perfection. 'Gum would be perfection'? 'Gum would be perfection.' Could have said 'gum would be nice,' or 'I'll have a stick,' but no, no, no, no. For me, gum is perfection. I loathe myself.
Oh no, the Mendels, they hate all living things, right?
Er, yeah, it's mine.
He seems to hate you. Are you sure?
Uh, I don't know. Why don't you put it right here next to my water?
Ok, I will have the uh, side salad.
And what will that be on the side of?
And for you?
Um, I'm gonna have a cup of the cucumber soup, and, um, take care.
Well, now, how come you guys have never played poker with us?
Oh, guys, you should've seen him. 'Read 'em and weep.'
And then he did.
Yeah, what is that? Like, some kind of guy thing? Like, some kind of sexist guy thing? Like it's poker, so only guys can play?
No, women are welcome to play.
Oh, great. Although I did sit down where there wasn't a chair.
Hey!
Hey, Rach, how was work?
By the way, Ross dropped by a box of your stuff.
Oh, well, I guess I had that one coming. I'm just gonna throw it out, it's probably just a bunch of shampoo and...
I can't believe I don't get to go to my own prom, this is so harsh.
I don't know.
Well, c'mon. Don't ya want to find out?
OK. Hold my board.
Atta boy.
We don't want it-it to be too much, we want it to be subtle.
Okay, now make it even, 'cause we don't...
What? What?
No. No, y'know you don't, you don't wear enough of this. What?
Since when, since when do you think I don't wear enough of this?
Oh. Oh, those little clunky Amish things you think go with everything.
I don't know. The left one.
Which ones?
Hey.
Hi.
I feel like we're the only two people in the world. Oops. Sorry.
It's so secluded up here.
I know. I like it up here.
What's the matter honey? Did you see a little mouse?
No-no! Big bear! Big bear outside! I think I-I-would you-actually, would you go check on that?
Ooh, Pheebs, what are you gonna say? Are you gonna tell him who you are?
Y'know what? Make fun all you want. This is a great bag! Okay? And it's as handy as it is becoming. Now, just because you don't understand something, doesn't make it wrong. All right? So from now on you guys are gonna have to get used to the fact that Joey, comes with a bag!
All right, I'd better go too. I have to go talk to my dad.
Umm, no, not at first 'cause I-I don't want to freak him out
Well, but aren't you pissed at him?! I mean this guy abandoned you! I gotta tell you if this were me, this guy would be in some serious physical danger! I mean I-I-I'd walk in there and I'd be like, "Yo, dad! You and me outside right now!" I kinda scared myself.
Hey, you guys! Guess what? Barry and Mindy are getting a divorce!
Bye.
I-I can't believe Jill's gone. I can't help it, I opened a gate.
Oh my God!
Wow!
Okay. All right, that's true! But y'know I just don't embarrass that easily.
No, not really. I mean you've seen me naked hundreds of times.
Uh-huh. But it was a first for the rest of my building.
What?! You totally get embarrassed!
No, I don't! Ross, I think I'm just a more secure person than you are.
Yes, we are very sorry to tell you this, but you, Phoebe, are flaky.
Okay.
So, maybe I am a little high maintenance. And maybe Rachel is a little bit of a pushover. But you know what we decided you are?
Hah!
That true, I am flaky.
Joey, y'know you get any mustard on that bag, you can't return it.
Joey, what are you doing with the bag? You're audition is not until tomorrow.
Yeah, but sandwich time is right now.
Why would I return it? I love this bag!
All right, then you owe me $350.
That's your, that's your dad's bedroom. That's your dad's bedroom!
Well, why do y'know go in that room and do your homework?
Ohh, I wouldn't do it in there. That's my dad's bedroom.
Why are you yelling?
Whoa, that Diet Coke just went straight to my head! Woo!
All right! Y'know what? That's it! You wanna do it?! Let's do it!
Yeah. Look Joey, it's enough all right?! You keep making these stupid jokes and this sleazy innuendoes and it's-I'm not-it's just not funny anymore!
All right, I'm sorry. Rach I-Rach I'm sorry. Okay? I'm sorry! Maybe I can make up for it by, taking you roughly in the barn.
Huh?
That's right, I wanna do it with you! I've been trying to fight it, but you just said all the right things.
So, if-if I mess this up, there's nothing else for dessert?
Nothing?
No, sweetie, I-I trust you.
You're not gonna mess it up.
Wow, Monica, I love that, you really have faith in me. Thank you. Technical question, how do you know when uh, the butter's done?
Hey! Everybody hide! Hide! I saw her! She's coming!
It's older than that. Ross was actually conceived right near this tuxedo.
Ohh!
Okay! Okay! Everybody down! Everybody down!
Crap.
I cannot believe you guys! He was really nice and he left because of you!
Okay! See you later!
Turns out he is kinda funny.
Yeah, but Sebastian? What is that? A cat's name?
Yeah, y'know what I noticed Rachel? He scares easy. Is that the kind of guy you'd like to take to a ball? "Hey Sebastian, would you like to dance?" "Uhh, okay-I gotta go!"
Umm, I think there was a restaurant... I know there was wine. . .
Ahhhh.
Oh. And how was the date?
Wow, well uh, uh, actually, Julie's downstairs getting a cab, I just need the cat toy, did Monica say. . . What? Why, why are you looking at me like that?
I don't know, I, I feel like I had a dream about you last night but I, I don't remember.
Phoebe! You picked Joey and Ross?! You can not have two backups!
Ahh.
But getting over was the hardest thing that I've ever had to do. And I never let myself think about you.
Of course I can! It's just good sense to backup your backup! Look, I've already lost Chandler!
What?!
Just think, in a couple of years we get to turn into them.
So Joey, you okay?
Yeah, I guess. It's just parents, after a certain point, you gotta let go. Even if you know better, you've gotta let them make their own mistakes.
If I turn into my parents, I'll either be an alcoholic blond chasing after twenty-year-old boys, or... I'll end up like my mom.
Hey.
It's left sweetie, but that's okay sweetie, that's a tough one.
Right?
Nope.
I don't know why you just don't say left.
Okay, go to the left. The left!
I bet he sensed that I was ready to have sex with another guy.
Wow! Look at that, Chip Matthews called. I wonder what he wants?
Well ah, actually...
Well, umm, why don't you give him a call?
Okay. Are you sure you wanna hear this?
You're lookin' at it upside down-y'know what? It doesn't matter.
Yes. I have a weird sense of humor, and I'm kinda strangely proud of my butt.
It's kind of a risky joke Tag, and what is-what is this drawing I can't figure out what this is?
Yeah, it's not like I don't have a sense of humor, huh? Hell, I even enjoy a naughty limerick now and then. But there's a time and a place, huh?! Unless you uh, have a limerick right now? No? Okay, well uh, you've got my fax number.
Whoa! I can't believe you did that. That was really sweet.
Oh, wait and on the nineteenth a secret crush announces itself.
Op, but the twelfth brings a lover's spat.
You are going to make a joke about my special present! Why would you do that?!
Hey guys!
Hey!!
That would be great! Wait, how long is Denise gone for?
Well there's an idea!!
Yeah!
Umm, she said she'd be back December 26th.
December 26th, huh maybe she's Santa Clause.
I mean is that woman capable of talking about anything else but sex?
All right, I was 15, it was my best friend, Ruth, and we got drunk on that hard cider, and then suddenly, I don't know, we were, we were making out.
Tell it again. Seriously.
Yeah, sure. Well y'know, earlier she was talking about geography.
Joey, she was listing the countries she's done it in.
How would you feel about taking out my assistant Tag? I'll pay.
Hey, listen umm, what-what are you doing tonight?
Nothing, why?
Huh, Rach I got to say it's gonna take a lot of money for me to go out on a date with a dude.
I'm not asking you to go on a date with him!
No, hey, come on, if he asked you first, that's only fair.
And heels.
Ross, did ask us first, and we set that night aside.
Ohhh boy, do I feel bad.
Oh yeah.
I'm more than okay, I am really, really happy! Wanna know why?
Yeah! Sit!
You okay?
Do I?
'Cause I am really happy about us. I think we are, I think we are so on the right track! Y'know? I mean, I think we are working, I think we are clicking. Y'know?
So, pretty much around the same time that you started telling this story.
See now it feels like Christmas!
... and that's the story of the dreidle. Now, some people trace the Christmas tree back to the Egyptians, who used to bring green palm branches into their huts on the shortest day of the year, symbolising life's triumph over death. And that was like 4000 years ago.
Hey you guys.
Hey Joe what's up?
Really? You don't say, because mine was licked on by kittens.
Phoebe, how would you do this to me? This was all your idea.
I know, I know, and I was gonna get it but then he came in with this needle and uh, di-, did you know they do this with needles?
Hey.
Hey.
You know how much I love that T-shirt! You never even where that T-shirt!
Okay, all right, give me the mug! I'll keep the mug.
No!! Y'know-y'know don't do me any favours. In fact, where, where's the rest of my stuff?! Huh? Like-like my umm, Hey, this book is mine!! And-and-and, and that T-shirt you sleep in? I'd like that back too. Yes, I do.
I'm just trying to help you, move on.
Oh, you are a petty man. You are a petty, petty....
Ohh, gee. I wonder why she thinks you're going to call her?
Yep. I just, I just watched her sleep for like hours, just breathing in and breathing out. And then I knew she was dreaming 'cause, 'cause her eyes keep going like this.
I'm telling ya, Joanna's got it all wrong. Okay? All I said was, 'This was fun. Let's do it again sometime. I'll give you a call.'
That's what you say at the end of a date.
You can't just say, 'Nice to meet you, good night?'
'Okay. Okay, daddy we'll see you tomorrow night. Okay bye-bye.'
I know! And four ninety-nine for a pillow top queen set, who cares about the divorce, those babies will sell themselves. And I'm appalled for you by the way.
I'm close. I'm cheap. I'm the king.
We?
Are ah, having dinner with my Dad tomorrow night, I hope that's okay.
Oh my God! Yes, I would love that, oh, that is soo sweet, Joey.
No.
Well my old man is doing a plumbing job down there and he heard they have an opening. So, you want me to see if I can get you an interview?
Not a problem.
Thanks.
Yeah! Especially not with all of these knives and cookbooks around...
Well, I've been up since six. Thanks to somebody's dumb-ass rooster.
You guys you really should get rid of those animals. They shouldn't be living in an apartment.
All right. I'm gonna go to the fertility doctor and um, see if I'm ready to have Frank and Alice's embryo transferred into my uterus.
Now, how will they know if you're ready?
Anyway, they want to take us out Saturday night! What do you say?
They're male nurses.
Not in my head.
Umm. Umm. Umm. I don't think so.
What? What are you talking about?! You-you're the one who's been telling me to get over Ross and move on. I'm moving on, and you're moving on with me. Come on, give me one good reason why you don't wanna go.
Yes! Great! Give me those cigs! Give it! Give it!
Oh but you could. You can. Absolutely! We can help each other out! We can get--what are those--those patches! We could be like the Patch Sisters!
Oh y'know, we really should quit. Okay, let's quit!
My late husband gave me that lighter. I'm not kidding.
Okay then!
Oh yeah. Right. So now, are-do you, do you still do music?
Oh my God, sit down! Sit down! How long as it been since we've seen each other?
1987, the day after Christmas, at Sean McMahon's party. I played you one of my songs, y'know Interplanetary Courtship Ritual.
Sometimes, you should come over sometime! I'll play you one of my other...
Oh my God! Joey Tribbiani from Days of Our Lives, just walked in here!
What is my sister doing there?! And why are the drapes shut?!
Oh great!
Hello?
O-okay, Rach calm-calm down, okay? She-she's really upset we're just talking.
Ross! I think she is trying to make something happen with you to get back at me!
Yeah, I guess. I-I... I mean, do-do you think we're ever gonna have that?
Ohh...
You okay?
You mean, we-you and me?
Oh no-no-no-no-no, no, no! We, you with someone and me with someone.
Wow! I definitely did not see that one backfiring! I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
What a nice story!
So Ross was in college and decided to jump at the chance to take a young girl to her high school prom.
Yeah, take your time.
Just-just so you know I was a freshman and she was a senior. So it wasn't as bad as-as...
Umm, well I would have to say that it's a, it's tragic love story.
Okay, umm, it's this tragic love story between Cathy and Heathcliff and umm, it takes place on like these really creepy mores in England. Which I think represents the wildness of Heathcliff's character. I totally get symbolism.
How would you characterize the theme of this book, uh let's see here , Rachel Green?
Well, that's sort of a given, but yes. Anyone else?
Oh-oh-oh, symbolism! And uh, the-the uh, wildness of the mores, which I think is-is mirrored in the wildness of Heathcliff's character.
Well, it's embarrassing. People were looking at us like we were crazy.
Well, y'know, the reason I didn't wanna go running with you is because um, well y'know the way that you run is a little...
So?
Why do you care?
Because they're people.
I can see that. You look like you slept with a hanger in your mouth.
You should both know, that he's a dead man. Oh, Chandler?
So how you doing today? Did you sleep okay? Talk to Barry? I can't stop smiling.
I know, he's just so, so... Do you remember you and Tony DeMarco?
Oh, yeah.
Oh! What a great way to earn some extra pocket money.
Yeah!
Great! Umm, well what-what I was doing in Chandler's room is that umm, I was cleaning it! In fact, he pays me to clean it!
Y'know when I said to you earlier that I was at work umm, I'm at my new work.
That's good enough. Right? Okay, well umm, I'm gonna go look at my books!
No seriously, y'know the contracts I gave you, did you overnight them?
Okay. Oh wait! Umm, did you send those contracts to Milan?
If this is your idea of sexy talk?
What contracts?
Okay please tell me that this is just one of your jokes that you do that I don't get.
Okay. Yeah, that would be nice actually, to have the apartment to myself for a night.
That sounds great.
Yeah? All right I'll call the airlines.
Oh yeah, so you can walk around naked.
No! So I can be by myself. Y'know? Have a little alone time.
Ok, Barry's letters. Adam Ritter's boxer shorts.
Can we just start throwing things in?
Ok, yeah, ok. Oh, OK.
Ok, and I have the, uh receipt for my dinner with Nokululu Oon Ah Ah.
Look, here's a picture of Scotty Jared naked.
Well, I wouldn't know because I got so freaked out that I hung up the phone.
I overheard you guys on the phone the other day, and you said, "I'll just tell Rachel that I'm doing laundry for a couple of hours." And he said, "Laundry? Is that my new nickname?" And you said, "No! You know what your nickname is, Mr. Big."
Well. Sounds like you're writing yourself a little play there Rach. Wow! Let me know how that one turns out.
Well, if you had kept listening, you-you would have heard me call him Mr. Big......ot.
What?!
Uhh, no, no, it bothered me when he slept with other women.
Chandler, this actually bothers you?
Yes, it does bother me! And I think it would bother a lot of people. Rachel, when you were going out with Ross, did it bother you when he flirted with other women?
And thank you, for that.
But y'know, I never really had anything to worry about. Ross was never very good at the flirting thing.
No, you're not an idiot, Ross. You're a guy very much in love.
Yeah. I'm sorry.
I just, I don't understand, I mean, how-how can she do this? Y'know, what, am I, am I like a complete idiot for thinking that she'd actually show up?
Same difference.
All ticketed passengers for Flight 1066 to Athens should now be on board.
I mean, it-it was like, it was like he made us into a team.
Alan.
He was unbelievable. He was like that-that-that Bugs Bunny cartoon where Bugs is playing all the positions, right, but instead of Bugs it was first base-Alan, second base-Alan, third base-...
Yep, we sure showed those Hassidic jewellers a thing or two about softball..
Can I ask you guys a question? D'you ever think that Alan is maybe.. sometimes..
Well, you might want to tell him it sounds like his wife is gay.
Who are these men?
Men. I guy I know.
She is not... She's gay. Oh my God. She is so gay! I can't believe this.
Good day for married people huh?
Since when, since when do you think I don't wear enough of this?
We don't want it-it to be too much, we want it to be subtle.
No. No, y'know you don't, you don't wear enough of this. What?
Well I, close your eyes, I just think you're gonna like this a little better, 'cause, close-close...
Blow it.
Okay, y'know what uh, actually, that's great. That helps a lot. Thanks.
Oh fine.
Ready? Wrestle!
Guys, come on! Let's go! The puck drops in 20 minutes! Come on, Joe!
Joey's not going.
Ohh, okay. Wh-Ah-ha! Wait a minute. Uh Ben, I can't do it.
Ohhh! Well of course I will watch him! We have fun, don't we Ben?
Okay, I'll see you later pal.
What?
I can't let him go out that way, he's got a meeting. You've got something here on your back.
Yeah, but Mon that's totally different. He was you're health teacher.
And you're still not attracted to him at all?
Hmm, no. I mean how can I accept a restaurant from him? I-I-I-I can't. I couldn't even accept a necklace from Stu Vincent in the seventh grade.
Oh, please.
What? Honey.
What you got there? Something else that's not yours that you can break?
You are ready to make a commitment!
Whoa! Don't know about that.
No. Um, I know you like this, and I want you to have it. I think it'll look good in our apartment.
Thank you.
Ross, you have to understand that your nice thing makes us feel this big.
Charity?
We're just tryin' to do a nice thing here.
Actually, it makes us feel that big.
I don't, I don't understand. I mean, you, it's like we can't win with you guys.
Okay, y'know what? There's only one way I'm leaving this hotel room.
Oops! All right, so what do you want to do now?
I wanna get out of the room! Y'know, I...I really miss downstairs.
Well hello! I'm Ross!
Good luck to ya!
All right! Ross, do you think it's easy for me to see you with somebody else?
I don't know.
You don't know?! Rach, you balded my girlfriend!
Y'know, hey! You're the one who ended it, remember?
Yeah, because I was mad at you, not because I stopped loving you!
Yes your honor, and here are, are forms, all filled out.
Damnit! Y'know this whole time we were concentrating on watching the babies and, and no one was watching Chandler!
Okay you two are asking the court for an annulment?
So based on your petition you are seeking an annulment on the grounds that Mr. Geller is mentally unstable.
Fine, I'm mentally unstable.
So do you uh, think we can get you one of those uh, uniform things?
It was nice to meet you.
Take care.
You like that do ya?
Oh yeah.
No! No-no, no-no-no, very quiet, said with love, no yelling.
Just sit over there!!
Okay! Okay, you're yelling again! See that?
Oh, y'know what? Since I'm here, I think I'm gonna have me a little beer on the port side.
Okay Joey, we're luffing a little bit, so could you tighten up the cunningham?
Well Chandler, what is this very weird, metal A Z thing?
Those are my gifts, I got them for you.
Ohhh. Thanks Chandler they're great!
Those are book ends! That's a great gift!
Oh, okay, I'm sorry, thank you for my azzz.
Oh, well, that's, that's mighty big of you, Ross. I said don't go!
No, you don't, Ross. Imagine the worst things you think about yourself. Now, how would you feel if the one person that you trusted the most in the world not only thinks them too, but actually uses them as reasons not to be with you.
No, but, but I wanna be with you in spite of all those things.
You know what? You know what? If, things were the other way around, there's nothing you could put on a list that would ever make me not want to be with you.
Well, then, I guess that's the difference between us. See, I'd never make a list.
They had to reduce it because of, of my deviated septum.
Oh my God.
What is with your nose?
OK, I was wrong, that's what they used to cover Connecticut.
You know what this is, this is us getting ready for the prom.
And now, y'know, I'm like... I'm like the other woman! I feel so..
Please. I haven't heard from her in seven months, and now she calls me? I mean, what else is it about? Oh! She was my best friend, you guys! We went to camp together... she taught me how to kiss..
Yeah?
..Naughty!
Right, I'll see you guys later...
No, why do we always have to do everything according to your time table?
NO!
No?
Actually it's the movie theatre that has the time schedule. So you don't miss the beginning.
No, see this isn't about the movie theatre, this is about you stealing my wind.
Joey, you can't keep this to yourself, if you know about this, you have to tell him.
What? So what are you going to do? I mean how, how are you going to tell Chandler?
Well, I was thinking about that and I, I think the best way would be, to not.
It'll kill him. I mean it'll, it'll just kill him.
Well, you could wait 'til I go to the dentist, maybe I'll kill him.
My God, I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I didn't mean to do that! I wouldn't do that!
What?! Wait! What are you talking about?! You love their Kung Pao Chicken!
Chicken? Chicken boy!
Nothin! This is the nine millionth ring store we've been too and I can't find the perfect ring! Ugly ring! Ugly ring! Ugly ring! It's a beautiful selection.
Okay, so maybe you don't get her a ring. Maybe you-maybe you do something different. Y'know? Maybe you get her an engagement bracelet, y'know? Or an engagement tiara? Or-ooh! An engagement Revolutionary War musket! (Picks one up from the display in the corner.
Excuse me, Dr. Bobby happens to be an excellent doctor.
You're still going to that chiropractor, that man couldn't get into medical school in Extapa!
Thank you! That's what I keep saying.
Uh.
Wait a minute, his name is Dr. Bobby?
Mon. I wish I could, but I've made plans to walk around.
No.
Twelve dollars an hour.
You know, Rachel, when you ran out of your wedding, I was there for you. I put a roof over your head, and if that means nothing to you... twenty dollars an hour.
Done.
Okay, so let's play for some pepper! Stop spending my money!
Monica?!
I'm just trying to spice it up!
I got it! How about, if we win, they have to get rid of the rooster?
Oooohh that's interesting.
I'm not going to sleep with Ralph Lauren. I mean, I could, but I wouldn't.
Ohh, Phoebe, what am I going to do?
Well, the only thing you can do. Sleep with Ralph Lauren.
Ohh, sleep with Kenny.
That wouldn't help me.
Ok, so anyway, you were telling me about Paris, it sounds fascinating.
Ok?
Ok.
It really was. There was this great little pastry shop right by my hotel. There you go, dear.
Come on, Lydia, you can do it. Push! Push 'em out, push 'em out, harder, harder. Push 'em out, push 'em out, way out! Let's get that ball and really move, hey, hey, ho, ho. Let's I was justyeah, right. Push! Push!
All right, okay, look, what if you could keep the apartment and get the tickets?
Hey, so? Are you gonna do it?
No. No. We're not gonna do that, y'know why? Because its not an even trade.
Done!
Let me finish.
Yeah, just give me a minute! Oh well, yes, I can think of one good thing.
No, absolutely. Y'know like it was umm...
Surely you can think of something good.
What?
Well you uh, you were always really good at the uh, at the uh the stuff.
Come on, please?! I'm boredddd! You let me do it once before.
Okay, who's next?!
No-o-o! No way!
Yeah well, if ah, if that's the rule this weekend... No!
Yes!
That's all right. I mean hard is it to get a couple drinks right, huh?
Oh, um, no, no, no, no excuse me, hello. Hi. My friend ordered an onion, not an olive, and uh I ordered a rum and Diet Coke, which I don't think this is.
I am so sorry.
Well, I would like to propose a toast to the woman, who in one year from today, become Mrs. Dr. Barry Farber DDS
Ummm, I think it's time to see the ring again.
Thank you. So how-how 'bout you, are-are you seeing anybody?
Yes, his name is Barry, he's a doctor, thank you very much.
Awww, just like you always wanted. Congratulations
Aww, not right now.
Oh, but that's okay.
Wait a minute. Do you not like all dogs? I mean, not even puppies?
They are needy, they are jumpy, and you can't tell what they are thinking, and that scares me a little bit.
Right, they are scary. Ahh, she just ate a treat out of my hand!!!
Is there a puppy here?
You don't like puppies?
Y'know what? That's a lot to remember, can't I just tell her you're a pig?
Why?! What?! Are you kidding?!
Just casually slip it in, y'know lay the groundwork. Tell her uh, I'm a loner-No! An outlaw! Tell her she doesn't want to get mixed up with the likes of me.
Hey, I'm gonna call her later! Honest! Oh come on, Chandler used to do it! He'd even make the girl pancakes! Plus, he'd make extras and leave 'em for me.
Well forget it, I'm not telling that girl anything. That is not my responsibility.
We... We are not... ...going to let it... be a problem.
Come on, it's not a big deal! We stayed up all night coming up with a plan so that us dating will not be a problem.
Oh yeah, what's the plan?
Wow! It took you all night to come up with that plan?!
Well y'know, we did other stuff too.
Okay Ross, we're-wait a minute. Umm, I uh, I kinda have a little confession.
Uh-hmm.
Congratulations.
What?
Well, y'know this whole marriage thing, kinda my idea.
What's that song? It has been in my head all day long.
Oh. Thank you.
That's no problem.
It's the theme from Good Will Humping.
Y'know who doesn't even like dirty movies? My new boyfriend Joshua.
Y'know, I figure if I can make coffee, there isn't anything I can't do.
That is amazing.
Congratulations.
If can invade Poland, there isn't anything I can't do.
Listen, while you're on a roll, if you feel like you gotta make like a Western omelet or something... Although actually I'm really not that hungry...
Yeah, at the lecture, I told you that last week, you said you didn't mind.
Funny book?
Hmmm. Oh, no, no, I just thinking about something funny I heard today. Umm, Mark, Mark saying 'I'll see you Saturday.'
Oh, no, no, no, it's-it's not the lecture ah, I mind, umm....
Oh, please tell me it's not because I'm going with Mark.
All right, I'm sorry. I'm sorry I didn't tell you but you were so mad already!
What line?
Wh-wh-what line? The line that prompted a student in my last class of the day to say uh, "Dude, don't you ever was your face?"
Of course I was mad! I told you I-I hate this stuff! Okay? It-it's not funny!
Hey Ross!
I mean maybe you didn't hear about a serious relationship called me and Joshua?
Uhh, hang in there?
Oh, no, I didn't mean, uh...
Oh, I thought you guys had just been on like four dates, I didn't realise that had become anything, yet.
Oh, no-no-no, no-no-no, it has become, it has-yeah. Oh no, those were four great dates.
Whoa, that Diet Coke just went straight to my head! Woo!
That's your, that's your dad's bedroom. That's your dad's bedroom!
Why are you yelling?
Hi, honey.
See you later.
We can't find Chandler...-'s vest. We can't find Chandler's vest.
Okay. All right. Honey listen. When I tell you what I'm about to tell you, I need you to remember that we are all here for you and that we love you.
Okay, you're-you're really freaking me out.
How can that be?! Oh wait! Wait! Are you, are you serious?!
Found the vest! I mean we're gonna have to keep an eye on it, y'know make sure we don't lose it again...
No! So I can be by myself. Y'know? Have a little alone time.
Okay. Yeah, that would be nice actually, to have the apartment to myself for a night.
Oh yeah, so you can walk around naked.
Naked alone time.
No! Phoebe just because I'm alone doesn't mean I wanna walk around naked. I mean, you live alone, you don't walk around naked.
Well, I feel fine, but I think you're bumming out the rest of the kids.
All you had to do was buy the card!
Hey! Look who's back! It's the birthday girl! How's the birthday girl feeling?
What?
Okay! Y'know what? I realized it was stupid to get upset about not having a husband and kids. All I really needed was a plan. See I wanna have three kids...
What-Pheebs?! Two dates in one day? That's so unlike you.
Wow, he's cute, Pheebs! But I thought you just started dating that Kindergarten teacher.
Oh, Jason? Yeah, uh-huh, we're seeing each other tonight.
I know, I know! I'm like playing the field. Y'know? Like, juggling two guys, I'm sowing my wild oats. Y'know? Y'know, this kind've like y'know oat-sowin', field-playin' juggler.
So Pheebs, do they know about each other?
Well, why shouldn't I be? I have great friends! I have a wonderful job!
Gooood morning!!
Eh, somebody's in a good mood!
Where you can make out with your assistant.
Come on, it's not a big deal! We stayed up all night coming up with a plan so that us dating will not be a problem.
Look Daddy, it's my life. Well maybe I'll just stay here with Monica.
C'mon Daddy, listen to me! It's like, it's like, all of my life, everyone has always told me, 'You're a shoe! You're a shoe, you're a shoe, you're a shoe!'. And today I just stopped and I said, 'What if I don't wanna be a shoe? What if I wanna be a- a purse, y'know? Or a- or a hat! No, I'm not saying I want you to buy me a hat, I'm saying I am a ha- It's a metaphor, Daddy!
You can see where he'd have trouble.
Well, I guess we've established who's staying here with Monica...
Well, maybe that's my decision. Well, maybe I don't need your money. Wait!! Wait, I said maybe!!
Monica, you don't even have a bed, you sleep in a ball on the floor!
Stop it! I will kill you. I hate the fact that my room is so small.
Hey, I have all the space I need. Just do what I did.
Y'know what? I am really tired of your bellyaching! Okay, I-I worked really hard at making this a nice place for us to live!
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
Wow! This is great! Look at all these cups! This is so weird.
Oh my God! You guys this is so great! I mean it's so unexpected! I mean Chandler's birthday is even before mine!
Surprise!
I was in charge of cups.
Oh, okay, not so weird.
Chandler honey, I'm sorry. Ok, can we watch Joey's show now please?
Why would you kill his fish?
Because sometimes, Phoebe after you sleep with someone, you have to kill the fish.
Yeah.
Wait, he's not here yet.
Hey, there was one Italian guy, OK, and do you even have a point?
Right, you, you only had a year. We only hung out every night.
Not, not, not every night. You know, and... and it's not like I didn't try, Rachel, but things got in the way, y'know? Like, like Italian guys or ex-fiances or, or, or Italian guys.
The point is I... I don't need this right now, OK. It, it's too late, I'm with somebody else, I'm happy. This ship has sailed.
Yeah, what're you saying, you just sort of put away feelings or whatever the hell it was you felt for me?
Ross!! Oh my--ugh!! You kept count?! You are such a loser!
Fine! We went out.
Not only did we go out, we did it 298 times!
A loser you did it with 298 times!
Oh. Oh! Ma'am? Excuse me, ma'am?
You get away from me!! You sick, sick, sick, sick-o!!
Oh my God! That's Monica!!
Oh no-no-no! No-no-no-no-no-no-no!
What's going on?
Joey has got a secret peephole!
NO but Ross. We are never gonna happen, OK. Accept that.
No, listen to me. I fell for you and I get clobbered. You then fall for me and I again, somehow, get clobbered. I'm tired of being clobbered, ya know, it's, it's just not worth it.
Well, but, but. . .
E-except, except that what?
No, no, ACC-cept that.
Oh my God you're amazing! Did you just pull that out of her purse?
We have to get her a present?!
Okay but look! Look at what I got! It's her address book! We have a guest list!
Uh-huh, and a little seed money for the party.
Cassie?!
No. Oh, oh, I guess it would be different if I were- with somebody.
Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, this is so stupid! I mean, I gave Barry up, right? I should be happy for them! I am, I'm happy for them.
Really.
Whoah, uh, what happened to, uh, 'Forget relationships! I'm done with men!' The whole, uh, penis embargo?
Oh, I don't know. I guess it's not about no guys, it's about the right guy, y'know? I mean, with Barry, it was safe and it was easy, but there was no heat. With Paolo, that's all there was, was heat! And it was just this raw, animal, sexual...
No, not really. I mean you've seen me naked hundreds of times.
I'm sorry. I'm done. I'm done.
Y'know, last night was embarrassing for you too.
Uh-huh. But it was a first for the rest of my building.
Okay. All right, that's true! But y'know I just don't embarrass that easily.
Oh, if I only want two kids, can I keep him for another year?
Yeah, I'm sorry.
Hey! How'd it go?
You did the right thing.
I don't like this anymore.
Well, it was just something Josh said about v-necks, but you had to be there.
Cookies and porn, you're the best mom ever!!
What? What?
Yeah, how does Jason look in a v-neck?
It's Joshua.
Ross! I think she is trying to make something happen with you to get back at me!
What is my sister doing there?! And why are the drapes shut?!
O-okay, Rach calm-calm down, okay? She-she's really upset we're just talking.
So that's the only reason she could be here huh? It couldn't have anything to do with the fact that-that maybe I'm a good listener and I uh I put on a great slide show!
Ross, I am telling you that she is using you to get back at me!
Oh! Yay! Look! There's a piece that doesn't have floor on it!
Well-But-Now, if-if you can achieve positronic distillation of sub-atomic particles y'know before he does, then he can come back.
I can give it a shot.
Stick to your side!
Hey, come on now!
Ah you went one too far. Uh, flowers or balloons?
Ooh great! Very Monica.
And chili!
Both!
We're paying for this y'know.
So wait, this guy goes down for like two years at a time?
Hey, is that when you wrote salt water taffy man?
No. No, he is my submaring guy. He resurfaces like every couple years and we have the most amazing three days together. Only this time he's coming for two weeks. Two whole weeks, which means yay.
That'll teach you to lick my muffin.
Hiii.
So who's idea was it to put everybody in the diner on skates?
Well this is great! I'll give you a call! We should do it again sometime!
Well, so anyway Beth, what I'm saying is I should've considered your feelings before I went home with you that night. I've ah, I've recently learned what's it like to be on your side of it, and I'm sorry. So, do you think you can forgive me? Great. Thanks. Okay, bye. Hello, Jennifer? Oh hi, Mrs. Loreo, is Jennifer there? Oh, she's not home huh? Well ah, actually I kinda need to talk to you too.
Oh, some idiot customer put a suggestion in the suggestion box.
Oh my God, they took my idea!
What are you talking about Pheebs? I don't... Oh my God, you drew on me?!
Pancho Vila?
Yeah!
Hey, you wet my pants!
Whoa, what kind of party was this?
Oh God, I hate my job, I hate it, I hate my job, I hate it.
Oh thank you so much Mr. Kaplan, thank you so much.
I need these hangers separated ASAP. You're welcome.
I know honey, I'm sorry.
Oh, I wanna quit, but then I think I should stick it out, then I think why would such a person stay in such a demeaning job, just because it's remotely related to the field they're interested in.
Oh, ah nothin'. I just felt like hangin' out here and reading.
Good morning. Nice breasts by the way.
Hey, what happened to you?
Oh, the water was sooo great! We jumped off this pier and my suit came off.
Ohhhh, sorry I missed that.
Huh. Except, Phoebe's not gonna be the one that gets to dress them.
Oh, that is so sweet!
I know! Phoebe is gonna love dressing them in these!
Because she's not gonna get to keep the babies.
Oh my God! We are throwing the most depressing baby shower ever!
What, so I can't lokk nice? There might be doctors there.
Yeah, save it for the cab, okay.
What are you doing? We're going to a hospital.
Joey, get out of the fridge.
All right, all right.
Now, she thinks that I made out with him and I did it to get her job.
Now I've upset you? What did I say?
It's not what you said. It's the way you said it....Oh My God, I'm a woman!!!
But why didn't you just tell her the truth.
I did but she doesn't think anyone would be stupid enough to confuse Kenny the copy guy with Ralph Lauren.
It just might be too hard, given the history and all that...
Oh, well, actually we were just talking about me not going to Ross's wedding.
Oh!
Wow! This reminds me of the time when I was umm, living on the street and this guy offered to buy me food if I slept with him.
Well, h-how is this like that?
She is so cute! You could fit her right in your little pocket!
I was thinking Chinese food.
Ohh, I love Chinese! How did you know I love Chinese?!
I don't know. I mean I like her a lot, and she's really nice, but...
But what?
Okay, I'll see you back at home, if I ever get a flight out of here.
Right!
Y'know-thanks!
Yeah, well...nah.
What? Wait, what?
I... It just-it took me so long to get that desk organized.
What?
I feel great. In fact! What?
Oh, I'm sorry.
There it is.
Or Carol! But they're funny to kids and who is it hurting?!
Okay, maybe they are not funny to you...
Oh my God!
Uh, y'know what? I'll tell you who it hurts! It hurts the kid who has all his clothes stolen in gym class so he has to go to the principal's office wearing nothing but a catcher's mitt!
That was you?! We heard about you in Junior High! Did you really just shake your fist in the air and shout, "I will be revenged?!"
Yeah, yeah, you go talk to your friend. You tell him, "Nice try."
No, it's all right, you can just drop the act Tommy. I know what's going on here. Your Danny's wingman right? You guys are best buds. Frat bros!
I'm gonna go talk to uh, a friend.
Man! He just keeps lobbing them up and I just keep knocking them right out of the park!
I think I need a drink.
Oh! Well, as a single woman, who is available, I think you look great!
Would you like to go to a basketball game with me? You know, its funny, basketball, because I happen to have tickets too... Umm, who likes the Knicks-
What do you think?
Huh. Yeah?
Yep. Oh, yeah, look you great. Oh yeah. Yeah, this looks great. Umm, so you like it?
Come on you guys! What are doing?! I thought we were the patch sisters!
Hey! Hey-hey-hey!!
Uh-oh, busted!
Yeah. That didn't work out.
Rachel we tried to quit, but it was too hard!
Yeah actually, I think we're gonna take off too. We rented a movie.
Then why are you wearing Monica's jacket?
Because it's flattering! Come on Monica! Come on Monica!
Oh! I won't say, 'no' to a movie!
Uh Pheebs, we just actually kinda wanted to be alone.
Oh, maybe that's Emily calling back to leave the exact same message.
Yeah well unless we tell him.
Well, if you're gonna be totally rational about this, I can't argue with you! All right? Fine, if you wanna tell him, tell him. I just don't want to be a part of it.
Hey Ross! It's you! I just want you to remember this feeling. You are lucky to be alive! So live everyday to the fullest. Love yourself, okay? Okay. Oh, and also get stamps. Bye!
Wow! Play that message for Emily and this whole problem goes away!
I can make you a legend. I can make you this generation's Milton Berle.
Oh, I called them. And when they ask me what I saw, I can be very generous or very stingy.
Go on.
And Milton Berle has a...
Ohh, not compared to you.
Well okay-Well don't ruin it! Just play along at least!
What?!
I know you're planning my surprise bridal shower.
Okay. Sorry.
Oh my God! We have to throw her a shower?!
Hi Tag! Hey, so did you have fun with uh, with Joey last night?
You see? Nothing is good enough for her!
Good morning.
Oh yeah! We went to the Knicks game.
Ohh that's nice.
What?! The duck?! What the hell did the damn duck do now?!
Why are you napping over here instead of over at your place?
Well, the duck...
Uh, well he did not get sick somewhere in there and it was immediately found and properly cleaned up!
Now, do I get to look at this book or is it just for people who are actually involved in the wedding?
You knew that our hot, sweaty, writhing bodies were....
You'd be okay if you knew that Mark had kissed me, and been naked with me, and made love to me?
Yes.
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la! Okay, okay, yeah, I would have been devastated but, I would still want to be with you. Because it's, I mean it's you.
Ohhhhh!
No, I don't! Ross, I think I'm just a more secure person than you are.
Okay. All right, that's true! But y'know I just don't embarrass that easily.
What?! You totally get embarrassed!
Is that so?
Yeah.
Pheebs, Monica tripped me, I don't think I can ever run again, ever!
Hey!
Hey!
Why? Why would you do that?
I don't know. Rachel I'm-I'm sorry that I hurt your ankles.
And not one of your coupons for an hour of "Joey Love."
Yes, you have to get her something, and it should be something really nice.
Oh, I know...
Ooo, a crossword! Can I help?
No! I'm sorry, honey, it's just that last week I got all but three answers and I really want to finish a whole one without any help.
Oh, no no no no. Oh no no no no. I have to do this to her?
Ok, ok, so you're not a fan, but I mean, come on, you cannot do this to her.
Uh--
Lather, rinse, repeat, and lather, rinse, repeat, and lather, rinse, repeat, as needed.
You know, I don't think we brought enough stuff. Did you forget to pack the baby's anvil?
I don't know, something either trees or disease-Ralph mumbles a lot.
Anyway, there's this big charity ball this weekend and Ralph Lauren bought a table, so I kinda have to go...
What's the charity?
Does Ralph mumble when you're not paying attention?
Yeah! It's weird. But the thing is need to find a date.
Well, y'know it's just been so long since I've been to Chuckie Cheese.
Oo! When's her birthday?!
I don't know Rachel, why?
Oh, I like Elizabeth.
Well thanks!
Noo!! No! You thought, you actually thought I wanted to have sex with you?!
Oh God, you saw me?! Oh!
You weren't trying to entice me with your nakedness.
No! No! No! No-no-no-no.
Ohh wow! I'm sorry, but Ross you kicked off your shoes!
So what should we do? Should we start looking for a new place?
You can't, because of the new skylight!
There's a skylight?! Wow!!
Y'know I'm-I'm sensing that um, my grandmother would not be comfortable with that.
Oh yeah? Startin' to feel her again there are we?
I can not believe he would do that to Mon-Whoa! Joey, do they know that we know?
Are you kidding?!
No!
No.
Joey!
Why? Just because you're not mature enough to understand something like that?!
Oh, Chandler that is so nice.
That is really nice...lying! No way is that the reason!
No, he's right, I'm totally lying.
Then what is it?
Uh, I don't have any brothers so I don't know, but uh, did you guys wrestle?
Hey, umm, can I ask you guys something?
Sure.
Oh-oh, yeah.
All the time. In fact, I was undefeated.
Well, I will go to the hospital tomorrow, it'll still be broken then.
No. I have got to get ready and go to a dinner at my bosses house. It's a very big deal, there's a lot of people there I have to meet.
And I'm sure you're gonna make a big impression. Hi! I'm Rachel Green. It's nice to meet you. Come on, you probably have a broken rib!
Rach...
But y'know, I could use a hand getting ready.
So Mon, when are we gonna meet this new secret waiter man?
So Chandler, have you heard about Monica's secret boyfriend?
Uhh, yeah. She uh, she uh, she uh might've mentioned him.
Ohh, he's really shy. I-I don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet.
Yeah, I don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet.
Hi! You might not remember us, but we are the girls that fogged you.
Oh he's nice. He's nice! Y'know, you always stick up for the people we fog!
Yeah?
We're-we're really sorry we fogged you.
Okay.
Now, you do realize that she's a cartoon, and way out of your league?
So, Chandler, who's on your list?
Ah, Kim Basinger, Cindy Crawford, Halle Berry, Yasmine Bleeth, and ah, Jessica Rabbit.
I know, I know, I just always wondered if I could get her eyes to pop out of her head.
Hey, Monica, who would yours be?
Yes, yes, Bombay is bery, bery nice time of year.
Oh, you can have an accent and I can't?! Top 'O the morning to ya laddies!
Just please stop!
Hey, will you grab me a cruller? Sit down! Will you go to the hospital?!
Dude! Hernia operations cost like, a lot probably. Besides it's getting darker and more painful, that means it's healing.
Yeah, and you don't mind if I call, because you only want good things for me.
Honey, it's not pushy, he gave her his home number.
What, he gave you his home number? As in like, to, to his home?
That's right good things, that-that is what I said.
Hello, Mark? Hi, it's Rachel Green. Oh no, don't you apologize. Yeah, I'll hold. He left my number at work, but he was helping his niece with her report on the pioneers.
Oh my gosh, wow. Monica. Oh my god. Mom. This is so great.
Now I love you even more.
Surprise.
Happy birthday sweetie.
Wow you, you. I had no idea.
I'll take all of your photos and put them into photo albums!
Foot rubs for a month!
Freedom!
Freedom! I want my freedom! Why won't you here me?! Sophie, help me! Help me!!
Sophie sit!!
Oh y'know what, we don't have to talk about work. We can talk about anything!
Well yeah, I do, but I decided to take a long lunch and spend some time with my friend Monica. Y'know I-I feel that we don't talk anymore. How are you? What is new with you?
Uhh, not much. Uh, work's good.
Okay. Umm...
Hey! Y'know what? Let's talk about relationships!
OK, listen, I'm sorry about last night and I really want to make it up to you.
Hi. Listen, I was um, thinkin' about. . .
Listen can you guys uh, speak up, it's harder for us to hear you when you lower your voice.
No, you, ya know there's no need to make it u. . . how?
Well, I was thinking maybe a um, a romantic dinner with um, candles and wine and then uh, maybe going back to my place for um, dessert.
That's right Joey, the chair angel came in and heeled your chair.
No, y'know what? Maybe somebody came in here and fixed it! Or something!
Someone like an...angel?
Get your non-believer ass outta my chair!
Well, she'll understand right? It's not like I did it on purpose.
Y'know what? No. It's not over until someone says, "I do."
Ohh-Do you think he will?!
No! Because he's in love with the British chippy! Look, Rachel, if you go, you're just gonna mess with his head and ruin his wedding! Y'know, it's too late! You missed you're chance! I'm sorry, I know this must be really hard, it's over.
I do! I do! I do! I do! Ugh, like I can really chase you. I'm carrying a litter.
The Waltham Residence.
All right, fine. Um, you were not the only one there. Joey was there too.
No, forget it.
Oh, why not. Was I doing anything particularly... saucy?
All right.
Was there...uh, huh, huh, huh... andybody, anybody else there.
Nice? They were nice. I mean, that's it? I mean, mittens are nice.
Okay, Pheebs, I was hoping for more of a change.
Y'know, I don't know why you're so embarrassed, they were very nice boobies.
Okaaay, rock, hard place, me.
You're so funny! He's really funny! I wouldn't wanna be there when when the laughter stops.
No seriously! Seriously! What has happened to the sanctity of marriage?
Let me uh, let me ask you something, do wedding vows mean squat to you people?! And why is it that the second we tell you we're going out of town, bamn there you are in bed with the neighbor's dog walker?!
We're sorry.
Didn't you spend last night at Joey's?
Aw what are you?! A detective?
Yeah, which, by the way Chandler, I would like back one of these days.
Ross, that was a Halloween costume, unless you would like me to go to this thing as Little Bo Peep.
Look, I didn't recognize it without that inflatable sheep.
Oh Rach, good, listen isn't this perfect for me!
Oh, it's perfect! But not for tonight.
Well, do you want to hear what actually happened or Joey's lewd version?
What is this? What's going on?
Oh good! Can I tell her?! Can I tell her?!
Joey's!
Okay...
No, I have all of the good words. OK, fine, fine, we can switch.
Phoebe, come on that's silly.
All right, so let's switch.
Okay.
Okay.
Barry was the guy that I was almost married and Mindy was my best friend.
No! Barry and Mindy.
Oh sorry, I hear divorce I immediately go to Ross. Who-who's Barry and Mindy?
Ohh-oh, wasn't he cheating on you with her?
Yeah, but that just means that he was falling asleep on top of her instead of me.
Well that is because your eye immediately goes to the big naked man.
Or we can do the actual telephone thing.
Oh my God! I love this apartment! Isn't it perfect?! I can't believe I never realized how great it is!
It's amazing! You better hurry up and fill out an application or I'm gonna beat you to it.
Ohh.
Okay, well if I stop playing with Joey and Chandler, can I play with Mark?
Because, he's my friend.
Okay, but do you really need another friend? I mean...
Is that funny? Am I supposed to be laughing?
I don't know, you thought 'See you Saturday' was funny. Look honey, Mark is in fashion okay, I like having a friend that I can share this stuff with. You guys would never want to go to a lecture with me.
Joey, what are you doing with the bag? You're audition is not until tomorrow.
What? Are you referring to my man's bag? At first, I thought it just looked good, but it's practical too. Check it out! It's got compartments for all your stuff! Your wallet! Your keys! Your address book!
Your make-up!
Yeah, but sandwich time is right now.
Joey, y'know you get any mustard on that bag, you can't return it.
"I'm Monica, I don't get phone messages from interesting people. Ever!"
You know what else I'm not gonna miss? "I'm Monica. I wash the toilet 17 times a day. Even if people are on it!"
"Hi I'm Rachel, is my sweater too tight? No? Oh, I'd better wash it and shrink it!"
Hey! I call her!
"Oh my God, I love Ross! I hate Ross! I love Ross! I hate Ross!"
I don't know, I'm sorry, I always slept in the back when we drove up here.
Yeah, we are definitely on Route 27.
Okay. We are at a rest stop on Route 27. Okay. There is no Route 27. Okay, either 93 or 76?
Okay. Hey, can you send somebody up and down 76 and check every rest stop, and, and also 93? Okay! Yeah, no they don't do that.
Ugh, okay, well somebody will come and save us.
No. But I was showing him some cufflinks and I felt his pulse.
You...are...not going to believe it! Joshua came into work today, and guess what happened?
He asked you out?!
Saucy!
What are these?
No, I've just always wanted to do that. Can you help me clean this up?
Well, you've been here for two months now and your boss is required to hand in a performance evaluation. But y'know, there is one thing that I have yet to evaluate.
Are you serious?
The basket is totally empty! My God, the neighbors ate all the candy!
Well, either that or uh...
With my alignment. I've got one leg shorter than the other.
Oh-ho please. Ask her how?
What do you need help for?
Oh God!
Argue with that.
Oh I know, my God, this is so-this rice is so-I am so good.
Hmmm!
Oh my God!
Behind you?
Oh, yeah, I'm sorry. They used to live here; sometimes they migrate back over.
Yeah, this is Tag. Tag, this is Phoebe. Phoebe, can I see you for a second?
Hi! Rachel Green's office.
You must be Hilda.
Phoebe! That's a great name.
Oh, you like that? You should hear my phone number.
Well forget it, I'm not telling that girl anything. That is not my responsibility.
Y'know what? That's a lot to remember, can't I just tell her you're a pig?
Hey, I'm gonna call her later! Honest! Oh come on, Chandler used to do it! He'd even make the girl pancakes! Plus, he'd make extras and leave 'em for me.
Fine! Now, where'd we land on those pancakes?
Hi!
Ohh, nothing, I just wanted to see you. See you and hug you. See you.
Hi!
What's up? You're voice sounded all squeaky on the phone.
Great!
Yeah! Sit!
Ugh, that was so embarrassing! I can't believe you let me go on and on like that!
And you're okay with that?
I don't know. It's going to be weird not having a job for a while, but I, I definitely don't care about my sandwich.
I'm sorry. It was just so funny when you started comparing Jane Eyre to Robocop.
That was not funny!
OK, OK, that is my favorite sweater, that is my third date sweater.
No.
Rachel, you say you're sorry or your sweater gets it.
Say you're sorry.
OK, you wanna play? OK, let's play, let's play.
For every night that you're asleep before I get home from work...
I know. I'm sorry. Look, I'll make a deal with you all right? Okay?
Hmm.
Yeah.
I will wake you up in a way that's proved very popular in the past.
Well, we were just talkin' about you guys gettin' married and how great it is.
Hey.
What's going on?
Yeah, you can get a Volvo. If that's what you really want.
Oh that's so sweet.
Well if you go to Disneyland, you don't spend the whole day on the Materhorn.
Now, most guys will hit uh, 1-2-3 and then go to 7 and set up camp.
That-that's bad?
Well you might if it were anything like 7!
All right uh, the important thing is to take your time, you want to hit 'em all, and you mix 'em up. You gotta keep them on their toes.
Well umm, that one is pretty but uh, I just, I just love this fabric Sorry.
Y'know, I don't really know you well enough for you to do that.
So it's down to these two, Nancy I know you like this one and I think I agree. Rachel, what do you think?
Oh don't be sorry, that's part of your job here to give your opinions and then I take credit for them--I'm kidding.
She is kidding, but don't ever disagree with her again. Okay, now I'm kidding!
I mean Ross all that does is remind us that you are interested in fossils.
Well, her father pays you for baby-sitting right?
No, no, that's funny. But maybe it's time to move on, let it go, y'know? Stop it! Besides, Rachel is going out with Elizabeth's father, so ah, he's much older than she is. Looks like I'm not the only one interested in fossils, huh?
Okay, okay. Uh, well uh, Rachel is going to need to yell sweet nothings in his ear.
Ross.
Oh Monica that was the best Thanksgiving dinner ever! I think you killed us.
All right! Isn't this a woman's hat?
Dude, stop talking crazy and make us some tea!
I couldn't possibly eat another bite.
I need something sweet.
She's right. She's right. You are no different than the rest of them.
Chandler, you have just described virtually every man that we have ever gone out with.
You are not a freak. You're a guy.
Wait a minute, wait a minute. Yes he is. You are totally different.
In a bad way?
Ohh, I mean, we were really drunk. I'm just glad we didn't do anything stupid.
Oh! I remember laughing! I laughed a lot.
And we didn't have sex.
Tell me about it.
Mornin' Pheebs. Well, my movie has officially been canceled.
Wait a minute! She just made a scene in the middle of the ceremony!
Oh!
Yes! Excellent! Perfect score!
Hey! Do you want do you want a little taste of Pheebs?!
It is time for you to give your maid of honor speech.
No, of course, of course I've heard of them! Ross, what did you get?
Apartment pants?
Yeah, you never heard of them?
Huh? Oh, I got this--this!
A pajmena?
We're not gonna do this, all right? She's just gonna think that we're doin' it.
Well, somebody should.
Look uh, if we're gonna do this...
Oh, I see, so everybody wins.
Who is it?
Ahh....So...Wow...The spring line, it's really going to be great this year, huh?
So you know, I...I handed in that marketing report and I never got to hear what you thought.
I didn't read it.
Yeah.
So I hear the Ralph Lauren fooled around with someone in the copy room.
Wh-no, but y'know who did stop in here looking for ya, Tennille.
Yeah me too.
Hey uh, have you guys scene Chandler?
So that marriage stuff that you were saying yesterday, you don't really believe that do you?
Sure I do. In fact, I think the whole concept of marriage is unnatural. I mean look at pigs. Let's take a second here and look at pigs. Okay pigs don't mate for life. I mean a pig can have like a hundred sexual partners in a lifetime, and that's just an ordinary pig not even a pig that's good at sports!
Ross, she's not weird, she just wants her stuff to be one of a kind.
Ross, get over it! It's not like she hates you.
Yeah but Pottery Barn! Y'know what I think? It's just she-she's weird. Y'know it's because she's a twin. Twins are weird.
Huh. Y'know what's not one of a kind? A twin!
Hey!
Hmm. Umm, why do you have a copy of The Shining in your freezer?
Yeah, I know. I had the greatest day though, I got to sit in on the meeting with the reps from Calvin Klien. I told my boss I liked this line of lingerie, she ordered a ton of it. How was your day?
I discovered I'm able to count all of my teeth using just my tongue.
Oh, I was reading it last night, and I got scared, so.
But ah, you're safe from it if it's in the freezer?
Oh God, oh God, oh God oh God oh God oh God....
Has anybody seen my engagement ring?
Yeah, it's beautiful.
No, look, don't touch that!
Oh, like I wasn't dreading tomorrow enough, having to give it back to him... 'Hi Barry! Remember me? I'm the girl in the veil who stomped on your heart in front of your entire family!' Oh God and now I'm gonna have to return the ring, without the ring, which makes it so much harder...
Y'know what, I-I have to go talk to her, would you let me just get changed?
I care!
And so do I.
Okay. Sure.
Am I going to let you watch me undress?
Did you tell the doctor you did it jumping up and down on your bed?
Aww, is it broken?
No, I gotta wear this thing for a couple weeks.
Nooo. I had a story all worked out but then Chandler sold me out.
Well, I'm sorry Joe. I didn't think the doctor was gonna buy that it just *fell* out of the socket.
Oh, well, you know, they're just separated so, you know, never know, we'll see.
Hi.
Oh, we were so sorry to hear about your parents splitting up, dear.
Well, I can't say any of us were surprised. Your parents have been unhappy ever since we've known them. Especially after that incident in Hawaii.
What, what incident?
Well, basically, lately, I've uh, I've uh, sort of had feelings for you.
Ohh, ohh.
When, when were you... under me?
OK, I need to lie down.
He broke up with Julie. Well, go hug her, for god's sakes.
Look at that! Look at that! We all do it. Okay, I'm stopping now.
Monica bang!
Oh-ho-ho, sweetie, sweetie, you gotta stop saying that, now. It's no big deal, it's not even worth mentioning, you see we all do it all the time. See watch this, Ben, Ben, Ben. Ow, Monica bang! Everybody bang. Ben bang. Rachel bang. Bang, Rachel bang! Oh, isn't that fun?
You okay?
Oh yeah! Y'know, if it's not a headboard, it's just not worth it.
I'm sorry, you know, maybe I wasn't being clear. Uh, this is our cart.
Whoa, I'm sorry. Excuse me. We had this cart.
Yeah, well, I had a 24-inch waist. You lose things. Now come on, get outta my way.
Hey, hey, hey there aren't any clothes in it.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, quit making up rules!
Oh honey, this is his office too. I told you we're Joanna's two assistants.
Oh, he's just goofing around.
Ohhhhh yeah, that's, that's funny. Why ah, why isn't he goofing around in his own office?
Why does Joanna need two assistants, how, how lazy is she?
Oh! Oh my God! What did I just do?
Yeah. Yeah. Oh, but once you find it, ohh it's so worth the wait.
Yeah, well, y'know umm... No honey, listen I think it's a great idea to become friends with someone before you date them, but I think the way you do it is y'know you meet someone, become their friend, build a foundation, then you ask them out on a date. Don't hit on your existing friends!
Won't-won't that take longer?
Yeah. I understand. I understand. Man, I wish I saw Phoebe first!
Come here to me. No-no, you come here to me.
She could be out of town. Maybe she'll be gone for months.
Its still there!
Mrs. Braverman must be out.
By then, the cheesecake may have gone bad. We don't want her to come back to bad cheesecake.
No that could kill her.
I know, I know! I just can't keep this one in, so I pick up the phone...
What? What secrets? You know secrets? What are they?
And you're not supposed to be gossiping!!
I'm not listening to you!
Ross, umm, you've been in there for a long time. I'm starting to get kinda freaked out.
Hello? Like he was really gonna send you one? She was a big girl.
Okay, okay, okay, I got one! Anyway- The valentine Tommy Rollerson left in your locker was really from me.
Excuse me?!
Really. Well, at least 'big girls' don't pee in their pants in seventh grade!
I was laughing! You made me laugh!
All right, all right, well you just blew your chances at dating Bob!
Jill this is not about me being jealous of you! This is about you being a brat! Wanting what you can't have!
Can't have?! Excuse me, the only thing I can't have is dairy!
Who?!
In Human Resources!!!!!!
Okay Monica, what are you doing? You're gonna lose your job! This is not you!
Yes, yes, it does. Okay, look, the restaurant called, they wanna know if you're gonna be showing up for work?
Nope. Going to the Big Apple Circus today.
No, it is me! Y'know, I'm not just the person who needs to fluff the pillows and pay the bills as soon as they come in! Y'know, when I'm with her, I am so much more than that. I'm- I'm Monana!
Hello? Yes, she is, hold on a second, please. Monana, it's for you, the credit card people.
Well, y'know what, no, you do not make my decisions because y'know what, you're fired.
Why? Why not?! People love to hear that!
I make the decisions, and I say no.
You can't fire me. I make your decisions and I say, "I'm not fired!" Ha!
Well...
Did-did you come up here to work on that term paper or something?
Obviously.
Elizabeth, what are you doing here?!
Yeah! Yep.
Well, why do y'know go in that room and do your homework?
You told this guy that I was looking for a fling?! You don't tell the guy that!
Well, y'know, possibly. You didn't tell him that, though? Right?
Ummmmmmmm, no.
Why not?! I'd be thrilled if I heard that some hot girl was just looking to get-oh I see.
Oh, between you telling him that I wanted to have a fling and me putting out on the first date-oh, he's so gonna get the wrong idea.
What? Wait a minute. What are you saying, that I'm a pushover? I'm not a pushover.
Well, people are different.
Ya, you know, Rachel ... she'll do whatever you want. Y'know, you can just walk all over her.
Oh, okay, you're not a pushover.
Oh my ... you think I'm a pushover. Well wait, watch this, you know what? You're not invited to lunch. What do you think of that? I think that's pretty strong, that's what I think. Come on, Monica, let's go to lunch.
Anyway, um, I guess this belongs to you. And thank you for giving it to me.
What?
Me.
Well, thank you for giving it back.
Hello?!
You guys, does this look like something the girlfriend of a paleontologist would wear?
Look, our table is down in front, okay, my boss is gonna be there, everyone will see if we arrive after it starts.
Has somebody been drinking my fat?
I don't know, you might be the first one.
Rach, did you check the machine?
All right. So you're telling me that there is nothing going on between you and Chandler.
What?!
Mr. Bigot. He tells the most racist jokes.
Me and Chandler?!
All right, put your 20 bucks down. First one to find the tasty treat wins. Okay?
Ughhhh!! Forget it! This is, this is not how this is supposed to happen.
Oh no-no-no! No, I got this all under control.
You really don't seem like you do. That's...
Well, what was supposed to happen?
Can you not look at me when I say this? I thought that if I could get you here, I could seduce you.
Ooh, so cute, that I'm thinking about jamming this pen in my eye.
I'll be right with you. Okay? Thanks, Wendy.
Oh my God! How cute is the on-call doctor?
Dr. Burke will see you know.
Oh no-no-no, not Dr. Burke. Dr. Burke is out of town. The-the on-call doctor will see me now.
Well, wait a minute! The puss is good! It means it's healing!
Oh honey, I'll say good-bye to you at the car if you don't mind the puss.
See ya!
Hey Pheebs, what 'cha reading? Pheebs? Hello? Phoebe? Phoe-Phoebe! Come on!
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't see you there.
Ow ow ow. Ow ow ow. Ow ow ow.
My god. You still have your Christmas lights up?
Fill this out and bring it back to me.
Okay, ooh, alright. Name, address... Okay, in case of emergency, call?
You.
No Mon, you want to put them in concentric circles. I want to do this.
We will.
Okay, Rachel, you wanna put the marshmellows in concentric circles.
Every year.
Y'know, for once, I am going to sit down and try to watch one of these things. .
Monica, last Saturday night, what happened on Walker Texas Ranger?
I think you should definitely go out with this guy.
Nah, he doesn't do anything for me.
Well, umm, Walker was looking for this big bus load of kids.... All right, I get your point.
All right.
Yeah and you stretch 'em out with your big old clown feet.
Oh yeah, good start Mon.
She lets you borrow them.
Do you wanna live outside?! Because it's gettin' cold! She gets tons of catalogs and umm, she'll fold down the pages of the things she thinks that I'd like.
What else?
Well, we're a little early, the lecture doesn't end for 15 minutes.
That's a hernia.
Why did I have to start working out again? Damn you 15s!
Yeah, but y'know we could sneak in and watch.
Yeah, we could. Oh hey look! There's some Kappa Kappa Deltas! I was a Kappa. Hey sisters! Wow, we really are bitches.
Phoebe? I'm sorry about the whole lifting out thing. You gotta come with me!
Yes that would have made more sense.
Y'know, I-I don't even feel like I know you anymore man! All right, look, I'm just gonna ask you this one time. And whatever you say, I'll believe ya. Were you, or were you not on a gay cruise?!
Come where?
Wherever I go. Come on you and me, we'll-we'll start a new group, we're the best ones.
Really! What is with that guy? I mean you'd forgive me if I fogged you.
O-kay!
Wow! That guy is so rude!
Well you did a little bit.
Oh my God, honey, I'm so sorry!
Well, there's a kiss that he won't forget for a couple of hours, y'know.
What?
Huh.
Yeah. Either that, or you just turned him on and sent him off to a stripper.
Is there a Julio here?
Well do you get to look through one of those like, those periscope thingys.
So do you have like any nuclear weapons on board?
I can't say.
I'm sorry, but I can't say.
Wow, it, it's neat learning about submarines.
What the hell is that?!! What the hell is that? Is that you? Ohhhhhhh!
Yes! Totally!
Oh! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Yes! Thank you!
Boy, you are really not a morning person.
BACK OFF!!! Get up! Get up! Get up! God damn it! Get up, get up, get up, get up, get up!!
Yeah! Can you believe that something that stupid actually got us our apartment back?
Good night.
Men are such idiots.
That's so funny to think if you'd just done that right after the last contest, no one would have had to move at all.
Yeah, let-let-let's pretend that's not true.
I'm sorry your wife is gay. I guess women aren't that great either.
Good day for married people huh?
I'm sorry your husband cheated on you.
Try telling my wife that.
Okay to come in?
Oh my God!! Ohh, that is it! I'm leaving! You are just a horrible person!
Said what? Exactly.
That you enjoyed the occasional drink...ing binge.
Wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait!! If you're gonna get all sensitive about it! I don't want to lose you. What if I, create a position for you? I'll make you an assistant buyer in this department.
Say more things like that.
Y'know, with the right pair of pumps, that would be a great little outfit.
Alright. Well then how about I call your supervisor, and I tell her that you shot my friend in the ass with a dart?
It'll be nice to get this off finally, won't it? Yes it will. Or we can leave it on for now, that's fine.
Listen, I'm- I'm sorry I was so hard on you before, it's just I...
Oh, Ross, c'mon. It's my fault, I almost lost your...
Yeah! Oh by the way, thank you for loaning us Pamela and Yasmine.
Thank God! I can't watch him anymore!
You guys ready fore the movies?
Man! They cannot get enough!
Okay, pick a card.
Ohh! This is so exciting! Oh God... Come and knock on my door...
Rach...
Yeah, he's gonna work on that.
We'll be waiting for you...
...once you know the stories, it's not that bad. First marriage, wife's hidden sexuality, not my fault. Second marriage, said the wrong name at the altar, a little my fault. Third marriage, well they really shouldn't allow you to get married when you're that drunk and have writing all over your face, Nevada's fault.
Oh My God, Phoebe, that's not Ralph Lauren. That's Kenny the copy guy.
What?
Yeah, no, Ralph doesn't look anything like that guy. He's-he's young and he's got long hair and a beard and a hacky sack.
What?
Oh..Go..Oh..and I told my boss that someone made out with Ralph Lauren. If she finds out that I lied to her, she is going to hate me even more. Phoebe!!
Hey! Out of all of us, who do you think is gonna get married next?
What?
Say something! Say anything! Ask her out! She's not your cousin!
Probably Monica and Chandler.
Hi. Could I have a pack of Newport Lights, please?
Ohh no you don't! You got lighting last time, lighting is mine!
Wh-what are we gonna tell him?
Well, the lighting was okay.
And I have costumes.
Oh great! That means I'm stuck with, "So, we were watching you in there and you were sittin' right here! Whoa!"
Nooo! It's not okay! I can't believe you would want to after what he did to me!
Umm, when were you gonna tell me that you're going out with Chip Matthews?
Now? Is it okay if I go out with Chip Matthews?
What, that little thing at the prom?
Monica! I couldn't find him for two hours! He was having sex with Amy Welch!
Both of them are here, both of them, both of them are here?
Happy birthday sweetpea.
Daddy.
Well, we could count again.
I can't believe this is happening.
Oh! Good thing Chandler's not here, he always wins at this game.
Could we be more white trash?
How desperate am I?
I just told my Mom I'd cater a party for her.
How come?
Well, you should be, this is all your fault! You meddled in our relationship!!
I just saw Danny getting on the subway with a girl and he had his arm around her.
Oh, honey, I'm sorry.
You had no relationship!!
No, but I was doing my thing and everything was going according to the plan!
OK, well, you wouldn't let me finish and I was jus- Ow. That hurt
Would you let me talk.
Did you just flick me?
Quit flicking
Ow, you stop flicking.
Let's just say my Curious George doll is no longer curious.
Stop it! Marcel! Bad monkey!
What?
Oh, Monica. You are not still going over that thing.
This woman's living my life.
Oh my God, you guys, what am I doing? What am I doing? This is so un-me!
I have absolutely no idea.
That's... that's classic.
If you want, I'll do it.
I know, I just want to bite his bottom lip. But I won't.
Well, sure...just a sec, though, 'cause Paolo's on his way over.
No, these aren't all my suitcases. This one's Paolo's.
Um, um, Rachel can we talk for a sec?
Oh! Ok, um, ok, um,
Oh, Pheebs, Pheebs...
Hey, listen, Ronni, how long would you say Chandler's been in the shower?
Bathroom's up there.
Great.
Oh, like, uh, five minutes?
Perfect. Fasten your seatbelts, it's peepee time. Hey, Mr. Trib.
Ohh, please! Cooking soothes me. Ahh. So, dig in!
So I guess it's Joey then!
This is so nice. Thank you for doing this.
Great! Oh, it all looks sooo good!
Hmmm!
C'mon, you're going out with the guy! There's gotta be something wrong with him!

There's nothing to tell! He's just some guy I work with!
All right Joey, be nice. So does he have a hump? A hump and a hairpiece?
Wait, does he eat chalk?
That's good enough. Right? Okay, well umm, I'm gonna go look at my books!
Oh! What a great way to earn some extra pocket money.
Y'know when I said to you earlier that I was at work umm, I'm at my new work.
Okay.
Okay.
Wow! Tell me something Joey--Whoa! I just fell right off the couch there.
Joey, you're such an amazing actor! How do you know where Dr. Drake Remoray leaves off and Joey Tribbiani begins?
Well, with Dr. Drake they always tell me what to say. And with Joey, I pretty much have to make it up on my own.
Yeah you did.
Okay.
Well hello! So, when are we gettin' back out on the water matey?
Hey.
Hey.
Oh uh, I don't know the boat way to say this, but uh never!
Why not?
Phoebe?! Wait a-but-but she just, she said that Joey was her backup.
What? Who?
Phoebe.
Ohh, I don't think so.
Ross! I just had a conversation with her, and she said that she and Joey made a deal!
It's okay! It's okay! It kicked once, it'll kick again!
Oh my God!! The baby just kicked!
Ohh!
Oh my God!
All right, well, everybody just remember where they were sitting.
Oh no, I'm sorry, you look a lot different from the last time I-I saw you.
This is Bonnie? This is Bonnie? You're Bonnie?
I can show you an ID if you want?
Oh yeah, well I just started wearing bras again.
Oh, that must be it.
Funny, because I was just gonna go across the hall and write that on Chandler.
Hey, I didn't make up the rules. Now, after you receive the doubling bonus, you get uh, one card. Now that one card could be worth $100 bringing your total to 1,500. Don't get to excited because that's not gonna happen unless you get-No way!
Well, this is the last box of your clothes. I'm just gonna label it, "What were you thinking?"
Hey you guys, I don't mean to make things worse, but umm, I don't want to live with Rachel anymore.
What?!
I know. Yeah, see, there's so much to do and I have so little time to do it in.
Yeah. It's just gonna be too hard. Y'know? I mean, it's Ross. How can I watch him get married? Y'know it's just, it's for the best, y'know it is, it's... Y'know, plus, somebody's got to stay here with Phoebe! Y'know she's gonna be pretty big by then, and she needs someone to help her tie her shoes; drive her to the hospital in case she goes into labour.
You don't have a car. And your license expired.
All right, check it out. Check this out. It says here that there's a place you can go to rent videos of all the museums! "It's almost as good as being there."
It's better! You can't go to a museum in your underwear!
I can't believe Mark didn't call. It's Sunday night, and he didn't call.
She's right in there.
Hey, Chandler!
Bummer.
Yeah, right. Look at you, you're practically giddy.
I can imagine you in a short plaid skirt and knee socks.
Yeah well, I'm guessing after this she's not going to be crazy about electricity either.
...now remember you have to imagine me in a kilt.
Do you wanna start telling secrets?
No!
Ummmm.... well, actually I'm already done, but I...I kinda got plans.
Hey, yeah... we could all sleep together and then one of us could get amnesia.
Hey Rach, what time do you get off? We're all gonna do something tonight.
You have other friends?
Yeah... I, uhh... I have a... I have a date.
Come on! I am here to take care of you! What do you need? Anything.
Oh, honey! Don't get up! What do you need?
Oh, no. Oh, nothing.
Okay, I have a wedgie.
Okay, that is all you.
Hey! Hey, you guys, I finished the crossword all by myself! Hug me!
I did it! Oh! I finished it! I did it all by myself! And there's nobody to hug!
Move!
Uh... yay!
Thanks!
Honey, no one thinks you're a pansy, but we do think you need a tissue.
I'm so sorry you're sick.
I'm not sick!! I don't get sick! Getting sick is for weaklings and for pansies!
I have not been sick in over three years!
I'm gonna grab you some tissue.
Y'know who doesn't even like dirty movies? My new boyfriend Joshua.
What's that song? It has been in my head all day long.
It's the theme from Good Will Humping.
Yeah right.
No, he told me. He prefers to leave certain things to the imagination.
I did, Monica was so sweet she left a little mint on my pillow.
I did.
Yeah?
Y'know what Joey left on my pillow?
What?
OK, you know what, are, are you being like, the blind date guy again?
What?
Uh, uh, well you're, umm, you're my lobster.
No no, you're uh, you're my lobster. See um, lobsters, uhh, in the tank when, when they're old, uhh, they get with, uhh, they walk around holding the claws. In the tank, ya know, with, with the holding and. . . Uhh, Phoebs you wanna help me out with the, the whole lobster thing?
Do the claws again.
Ross, no! There is no way I am leaving this room looking like this!
What?! What else did he say?
Umm, he said he thought I was funny. So... Okay, look-look umm, let's just go downstairs, we'll have some fun, and you will forget all about it.
Oh, come on! Rach, it's-it's not that bad.
Ross, I am a human doodle!!
O-kay!! See what you did, I'm gonna be doing it by myself now. Okay?
All right. Fine.
Yowzah!!!
Aww, come on.
That's it. Ow!!!
Ugh, you will not believe what that sleaze-ball from Ralph Lauren did too me!
Here let me...
Wh-whoa! All right, okay-okay, I see, I see what's going on here! Now listen, look-look, I'm sorry if I gave you the wrong impression, but I am not some hussy who will just sleep around to get ahead! Now even though I , hey-hey-hey, even though I kissed you, that does not give you the right to demand sex from me. I do not want, this job that bad. Good day, sir.
Okay-okay that-that's amazing. How did you know that?
You got ink on your lip.
Okay, now that is the third time someone has said something like that to me today.
Well it's wonderful to have you up and about, again, dear.
Stay well.
Rach! Rach!
Oh, hi!
And the fact that you were jeopardising my career never entered your mind?!
You promised you would break up with her!
I did break up with her! She just took it really, really well!
It did enter my mind! But then something happened that made it, shoot right out.
Y'know what Chandler, you got yourself into those cuffs, you get yourself out of them.
Really? Just casually strewn about in that reckless haphazard manner?
Uh, Mon, you-you gonna leave your shoes out here?
Uh-huh!
Doesn't matter, I'll get 'em tomorrow. Or not. Whenever.
She is a kook.
Hey, honey! What's the matter? Fine, I was just trying to be nice! Whoa!
I thought I was making headway, everyone was smiling at me all day, I get off work and I find out that they wrote this on my chef's hat.
Hey, maybe they meant to write, 'Quiet, bitch.'
I mean I have not been picked on this much since kindergarten and they had to bring in someone from junior high to do the see-saw with me.
Ohhh!
I'd say from the looks of it; our naked buddy is moving.
Yeah umm, they're called wallets.
Oh hey, you guys, look! Ugly Naked Guy is putting stuff in boxes!
Ironically, most of the boxes seem to be labeled clothes.
Ohh, I'm gonna miss that big old squishy butt.
Yeah, we ended up spending the day together and had such a great time!
Hey Joey!
Erin! Still here!
Why wouldn't ya? Erin is great! Then-then there's you guys.
Ohh, listen. I've got to get going. Today was great, thanks!
Ohh, you can say. Come on, I don't want you to feel like you can't tell me things.
Why's that?
I don't think I should say.
Okay.
'Kay.
Hello! Oh yeah! Hey! Hold on a second she's right here! It's Chandler.
Yeah, poor cat, never saw that big butt coming.
Right.
Oh? Hello you.
Hello Phoebe, I've been thinking about you all day.
Wait! No, that's ridiculous. Come on, he lives three blocks away!
Yeah. Could you just sign right here please?
Oh, sure. Whoa-whoa, what's this? The delivery charge is almost as much as the couch!
Yeah, y'know what? I'll take it myself, thank you! All right Rach, let's go!
Yeah! Are you kiddin'?
Phoebe! It's 6 o'clock in the morning! Why aren't you at Gary's?
All right! Come on Monica! Look alive! Come on, look alive!
Oh good, you're all up.
Oh yeah, that's over.
What?!
Ross! What are you... I'm sorry sir. I just, I think he just really likes you.
So uh, I'm on my way back to the bathroom.
Yeah, all right. All right! Just keep walkin'! All right?
Hey! Y'know that teacher who had a baby with her student?
What the? What...
A mistake?! What were you trying to put it in? Her purse?!
Just get away from me!
No, it was a mistake! I made a mistake! Okay?
Whe-where did he put it?!
Ross, you had sex with another woman!
Well, if it makes you feel any better, I made a fool out of myself.
Oh, Ross, I'm sorry. I completely ruined your evening.
Yeah.
Helps a little.
Is there room on that step for a pathetic loser?
Because you're not finished yet and I won't have it! Greens do not quit!
What do you mean you quit?! You can't quit!
Why not?!
Greens? I'm a Tribbiani! And Tribbianis quit!
Oh my God, wait did I-I just said Greens don't quit didn't I? Did I just say Greens don't quit?!
Well, you know I'm not surprised. I mean have you seen them together, they're really cute.
What are you the memory woman?
Their not breaking up. Chandler and Janice. Their not breaking up. He didn't blink or anything.
Cute! This is Janice! You remember Janice?
Yes, Joey, I remember, she's annoying, but you know what she's-she's his girlfriend now. I mean what can we do?
Oh honey, I'll say good-bye to you at the car if you don't mind the puss.
Okay!
Anybody want to say good-bye to me at the car?
See ya!
Well, wait a minute! The puss is good! It means it's healing!
Okay, so anyway I'm sittin' in my office and guess who walks in.
Joey! Kinda in the middle of a story here!
Ooh, sorry. Sorry. You finish, go.
I'm gonna be on two TV shows!
Oh, that's great!!
How do you think this suit would look on an assistant buyer at Bloomingdale's?
Hey, Pheebs, quick question for ya.
Yeah.
I don't know, it would totally depend on her coloring and... You got the job!!
Yes!!!
Ah, first, I-I would like to say thank you for agreeing to see me again.
Sure. Joey...
Dahhhhh!! No! Noooo!!
That's quite all right, but I feel obligated to tell you that this meeting is being videotaped.
Okay. Umm, well, first I would like to start by apologizing for kissing you and uh, for yelling at you.
Hi guys! This is Josh. Josh, these are my friends, and that's Ross.
How's it going with her?
Great, actually. I'm thinking tonight, maybe the night. Yeah, I mean ah, the kids are gonna play together and then when they're asleep, I'm thinking Amanda and I break open a bottle of wine, and do a little "playing" ourselves.
Hi, Josh.
Hi.
Okay honey, you can finish this later we're gonna be late. We gotta go.
Honey, we have to go. Our reservations are at 8:00.
...in Reservations at 8:00 by Neil Simon. Thank-thank you Neil. Thank you for the words.
Please, don't play the music. Just uh one more. LIVE FROM NEW YORK! IT'S SATURDAY NIGHT!!
Oh hey! How was your audition?
Well, Ross, we were worried about you. We didn't know how you were going to react.
Awww, no, it's okay, we've actually known for a while.
What? What? What?! You guys knew? You all knew and you didn't tell me?!!
You were worried about me? You didn't know how I was going to react?
Okay, all right, whew! What do you say we all clear out of here and let these two lovebirds get back down to business? Hey-hey-hey, I-I-I'm just talking here, he-he's the one doing your sister.
He even offered to meet me for lunch tomorrow to prep me for it.
Yay!
There you go.
Oh, that is amazing!
Yeah well, if I know Mark, and I think I do, I'd expect nothing less.
Yeah. Yeah. Definitely, well it definitely took me by surprise, but I'm okay.
Oh.
I know if you were getting married I'd feel, kinda..... y'know.
Yeah?
Yeah.
It's okay. Sometimes, things don't work out the way you'd thought they would.
Well, apparently he scares easy.
Oh, Rachel, I'm-I'm sorry.
Come here.
Oh, hey, don't you have to go pick up Emily?
No, he told me. He prefers to leave certain things to the imagination.
Y'know who doesn't even like dirty movies? My new boyfriend Joshua.
Yeah right.
Oh-oh, yeah, and did he also say that ah, some of the dialogue was corny and that he actually found it was funny and not sexy?
Yes!
Ok, Chandler, Mon, there's only one bananna nut muffin left.
Ok Rachel, make a special flan wish.
Ok, I've got one. Wow, those things almost never come true.
Oh, I ordered mine first.
Yeah, but I'm, I'm so much faster...
I'm Monica's maid of honor. Okay? Don't try to blue pin me!
So now, these are all the tuxedos that we make and if there's anything that you like, we can make you a deal. Anything at all. But these are the three that Monica pre-approved.
Well, thanks a lot for hookin' me up Rach. I want you to know that I want you to attend our wedding as my guest.
Well, what's the deal with these? These-these look nice.
Oh they are nice. We-we custom-make tuxedos for celebrities and then when they're done with them they just send 'em back.
Right, you, you only had a year. We only hung out every night.
I didn't know then. And how come you never said anything to me.
There was never a good time.
Not, not, not every night. You know, and... and it's not like I didn't try, Rachel, but things got in the way, y'know? Like, like Italian guys or ex-fiances or, or, or Italian guys.
Hey, there was one Italian guy, OK, and do you even have a point?
I can't go to my own prom without a date, I can't, it's too late.
He'll be here OK, take a chill pill.
I just told Rachel that Roy touched my boob.
If you're not going then I don't want to go either.
Oh, I'm gonna kick Chip's ass.
Okay get your coat! Oh! When did you unhook this? Nice work!
No! Come on its late, we're not gonna go down to the office.
Okay I understand. I wouldn't want to be proved wrong either.
All right, it won't go down any further. It's stuck.
Ugh. Well, we're just gonna have to jump. Yeah. Now, we're gonna have to make sure to land to the right of that patch of ice, okay? Not hit the dumpster on the other side and uh, and try to avoid that-that weird brownish red stuff in the middle. So, when you get down there...you go up to the roof and you let me in.
Hey! Joey, would you mind giving me and Ross a hand moving his couch?
Hey by the way, I'm sure Sipowicz is gonna be all right. I heard that kid from Silver Spoons is really good. And where did you find my badge?
Oh.
Oh, I'd love too, but I got acting class. But y'know what? I guess I can blow that off, for you.
Thanks!
Well y'know, we have 7 people and like 10 pizzas, what do you think?
Yeah. I'm-I'm telling you he's really sweet and he's really funny and he's just ugh, got a good heart. And besides, I y'know, I think he really likes you.
Really?!
I just, I thought Joey was there.
Hey Ross? Umm, I just ran into Caitlin in the hallway and-and uh, you must be getting better at this flirting stuff than I thought.
Now Joey remember, if you win you have to hug me! You hug me!
Do you got your gracious loser face?
Yeah.
Okay. Can I squeeze your ass?
On TV?! Yeah!
Wow! Have you ever rescued anyone from a burning building before?
Hey!
Vince is a fireman.
98 hot saves, highest in the force.
Well, y'know if Joey and I played with matches we could get you up to an even hundred.
And your lap does not count! Okay? Come on help me move this.
So that there will be a decent place for me to sit.
Rach, there is a decent place to...
No. No. No.
No?
This bench, it's hollow! I can't believe I never knew that! Oh, the presents!!!
Hey, this is hollow.
What?
No, don't look directly at them!
What?
Look, If I don't get to London!! He is going to marry that other girl!!!
Sure, you know what? Come on, we'll just tell them that there was like a problem with like the "engine".
I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to step aside, Miss.
I can't imagine why.
All right, you know what? I am not leaving here, until you call that plane back!!
Wait a minute, you're only giving free stuff away to the pretty girls?
Hey Joey, how come our stuff isn't free?
It will be when you look like that in a tight skirt! This is great! I'm getting more dates than ever!
Yeah Joey that is so gross!
How about a scone on the house baby?
Oh hey-hey wait! How do we fairly decide who gets the phone?
Yeah! And until now, I didn't think I'd love again.
Nice try.
I don't know.
Well umm, maybe we could uhh... Ah-ha! Too slow!!
Whoa, wait, listen, I think I'm just gonna talk to Ross about what he think it meant.
What?
Toe the line. Thread the needle. Think outside the box!
Wait. Rachel, no, he's married. Married! If you don't realise that, I can't help you.
Okay, you're right. You're right. You can't help me.
OK Julie, so now let's start with your childhood, what was that like?
I got time.
Rach, I know her pretty well, can I go? That's fine.
Well, in a nutshell. . .
Nah, uh, uh, uh, uh.
: Thank you. : I saw your twenty-five, and I raise you... seven.
OK, then get me your purse.
OK, here you go. Good luck.
...teen!
: Joey, I'm a little shy.
I mean if you think about it, I mean Ross did learn something from each marriage.
Listen, I-I guarantee you keep your job if you can teach me how to talk to women like you do.
Oh wow Wayne, it's not really something you can teach y'know? It's pretty much something you're born with if you--You-you can teach it! I'll show you right how to do it.
How to make the next one even shorter?
Now wait a minute that's not fair. He was married to me a hell of a lot longer than he was married to Emily, he just didn't tell me. Maybe I have to pee again.
I don't know! But maybe if we keep that drawer shut, it'll die.
Oh, I think I saw some in here.
What is it?!
I can't believe we're living here!
What?! What-what is it?!
Oh God I just can not imagine what is gonna happen if Chandler doesn't show up!
Oh thank you! Oh God! Can I have another one?
Sure. Do you need some floss?
Oh here's a whole bunch.
Oh, I mean she's gonna be at the wedding waiting for him and people will be whispering, "Oh that poor girl." Y'know? Then she'll have to come back here and live all alone.
Well, don't look at me! My hair's straight! Straight! Straight! Straight!
I don't use a curling iron.
Well someone does.
It could've been a hair straightener.
Oh.
Well, I've been up since six. Thanks to somebody's dumb-ass rooster.
Hey!
Hey, what are you doing shopping at eight in the morning?
You guys you really should get rid of those animals. They shouldn't be living in an apartment.
Yeah! Especially not with all of these knives and cookbooks around...
Oh my God! Did you check your entire desk! Did you check all the drawers!
Hi! I got you some coffee. To, uh... ...fair enough. So! Do you got anything for me?
Still no luck.
Do you want me to check again?
Well yeah, I wish that you would. Well, no it's not in there! How about that drawer?
Oh my God! We are throwing the most depressing baby shower ever!
Huh. Except, Phoebe's not gonna be the one that gets to dress them.
Because she's not gonna get to keep the babies.
Wait a minute! Unless, we give her all gifts she can use after she's done being pregnant. Like-like umm, regular coffee, Tequila.
Oh, and somebody can get those leather pants she's always wanted!
Hey Mon, what are you doing now? Wanna come see a movie with us?
This bicep?
Well it's not flexed right now!
Uhh, y'know actually I was gonna do some laundry.
Oh.
What? No! It's not a big deal! I do that too, with my shampoo bottle.
I'm fourth! Look at you with your little maple syrup award!
Yeah may-maybe you don't tell anyone about this.
Really?
Yeah.
Ok, thanks Pheebs Oh my God, why have I never tasted these before?!
Oh, Pheebs, Pheebs...
Ok, um, we haven't known each other for that long a time, and, um, there are three things that you should know about me. One, my friends are the most important thing in my life, two, I never lie, and three, I make the best oatmeal raisin cookies in the world.
Oh, I don't make them a lot because I don't think it's fair to the other cookies
All right, well, you're right, these are the best oatmeal cookies I've ever had.
Well, okay, look. I don't know, listen, I don't know what's going on here but let's...
Umm, you-you and your sister seem to have umm, a very special bond, and...
Oh great! That special bond again! Why do women have such a problem with the fact that I'm close with my sister?
Do-do you, do you have brothers?
No, I have two sisters. But one of them has a very masculine energy.
No, you're right, you are absolutely right. I mean that makes, that makes everything different.
Hey, Chandler, don't freak out! I'm telling you something you already know! Come on, she broke up with Richard because he didn't want to have babies. And she's a woman, and she's almost 30, and y'know it's Monica.
I don't see it that way. Okay? Because, I see two Monicas, the one that was my friend, who lived across the hall, and wanted to have a lot of babies and then the new Monica, who I just started to date. Now, who's to say what she wants?! I'm right. I'm right. Am I right?
Okay. It's not different at all, is it?
Not unless different means the same.
I know I had it this morning, and I know I had it when I was in the kitchen with...
Doy! Probably right before she lost it!
You don't get a lot of 'doy' these days...
...Dinah?
Ohhhhh, don't be mad...
Well that-y'know it's just uh, I've never done that before. Me and him alone.
Huh umm...
What's the matter?
Rach, he's not an ex-con.
Okay. Okay. Okay. Uh, what do I, what do I do with him?
Oh, my-my new assistant has very happy that I hired my new assistant.
Ohh, my new assistant is working out, yes.
Was she happy you gave her the job?
Hello? Oh hey! Can you, can you hang on a second? It's the producers over at Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E. can you excuse me for a minute? Hey, funny you should call. I was just looking over next week's script. Canceled?! Like they're taking it off the air? Ohh. All right, see you Monday. We're not even shootin' them anymore?!! All right, bye! They canceled Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E!
Sorry.
It's not! I'm defrosting a chicken. Oh, I uh sold Mrs. Whiskerson.
All right! Let's go! Let's go Team Monica! All right, we can work out the name later.
Rachel! What is your cat doing in one of my bowls!
Oh, thank God!
Did you get your money back?
Hey. I've got something that's gonna make you happy. Guess what Gunther found?
Would you stop already? Get out of the bitter barn and play in the hay.
Oh, you're right I, I should play in the hay. Forget about the fact that I just dropped 400 dollars to replace a bracelet that I hated to begin with. Bring on the hay.
Hey now you have two. Oh, now you have two.
What am I gonna do, huh?
Hey. Whe-ell, look at you, finally got that time machine workin' huh?
Hey.
Hey.
Seriously, you like it? This guy was sellin' them on 8th avenue and I looked at 'em and I though, you know what I don't have?
A mirror?
No, see this isn't about the movie theatre, this is about you stealing my wind.
No, why do we always have to do everything according to your time table?
Actually it's the movie theatre that has the time schedule. So you don't miss the beginning.
You go girl. I can't pull that off can I?
Excuse me, your, your, your wind?
Joey, you're gonna have to stop rushing me, you know what? You don't get any dessert.
Yeah, I'm not gonna pay for those acting classes anymore.
Rachel, there you are! Come on, let's serve that dessert already!
Really?
No, I'm just kidding I would never do that to you! Okay, everybody, it's trifle time!
I don't know. What do you mean last night? Nothing, nothing uh, happened last night.
What?
Are we gonna talk about what you guys did last night? Or...
Yeah!
Uh-huh! Ross invited us all to watch.
Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, why are we so sure that this is a girl?
Oh, 'cause you can just match the evaluation to the exam with the same handwriting and boom, there's your admirer.
A hot girl's at stake and all of the sudden he's Rain Man.
It's a girl! Anyway, it wou-it wouldn't matter. Okay? Because I'm a teacher and she's a student.
Oh, is that against the rules?
Well uh, his answering machine was very understanding. Ugh. I feel blue.
Well, I did my best to convince him that I'm not some crazy girl who is dying to get married-I'm just going through a hard time.
What did he say?
Ohh, sweetie! Hey, I bet you anything that he's gonna call you again.
Yeah, maybe, but I don't think I even care. I don't think he's the one I'm sad about. Y'know, I know that I said that I am totally okay with Ross getting married, but as it turns out, I don't think I'm handling it all that well.
Are ah, having dinner with my Dad tomorrow night, I hope that's okay.
'Okay. Okay, daddy we'll see you tomorrow night. Okay bye-bye.'
We?
Oh shoot, tomorrow's not so good, I'm supposed to um, fall off the Empire State building and land on a bicycle with no seat. Sorry.
Ross, my father doesn't hate you.
That sounds like a plan. Umm, is there a place I can go freshen up?
Ohh, you should know, this place is a real babe magnet. Wanna make out?
Hey, here's an idea. Why don't uh, I put the food in the fridge and we can eat it later?
Oh yeah, yeah uh, it's down the hall and uh, second door to your left.
Ah.
Honey wait, Joey, I'm sorry I mean as terrific as I think you are with it...
Y'know, Joey, I think it's time to give up the bag.
I don't wanna give up the bag. I don't have to give up the bag! Do I Rach? Oh, you think I should give up the bag!
Oh, hey!
...I just don't know if the world is ready for you and your bag.
Wow, this is so cool, you guys. The entire city is blacked out!
Hi. Um, I want to start with a song thats about that moment when you suddenly realize what life is all about. OK, here we go. OK, thank you very much.
Oh, great. This is just...
Mom says it's all of Manhattan, parts of Brooklyn and Queens, and they have no idea when it's coming back on.
Wow, you guys, this is big.
Ohhh! Well of course I will watch him! We have fun, don't we Ben?
Hey!
Hey I'm sorry to do this to you again but uh, is there any way you can look after Ben for a little bit? I-I've got this meeting at school. And-and he-he asked for his uh, 'Fun Aunt' Rachel, so...
Okay, I'll see you later pal.
Ohh, okay. Wh-Ah-ha! Wait a minute. Uh Ben, I can't do it.
You see, you look beautiful. For god sakes, dim the lights.
You look fabulous honey, you really do.
Yeah? Are you sure, really.
I, I, I'm hideous.
It's gonna be ok. Ryan's been under water. He's just gonna be so glad that you don't have barnicles on your butt.
Everybody, this is Paolo. Paolo, I want you to meet my friends. This is Monica.
Wow.
Lucky sixes....
Hi!
And Joey....
No! No, I am not getting in a car with Ross, we will just have to live here!
Ugh, okay, well somebody will come and save us.
Who? I mean have you seen a car come by here in the last hour and a half? I think we should call Ross, maybe he can get a car and come pick us up.
But if...
No you guys, I am not getting in a car with him, you'll have to think of something else.
Yeah, I-I-I just pulled the tab and I just fogged his yeti ass!
It was like this crazy-eyed, hairy beast man! He was like a, like a bigfoot or a yeti or something!
And he came at us with an axe, so Rachel had to use a bug bomb on him!
Uhh, like dark hair, bushy beard?
Yeah!
You want me to just quit my job so that you can feel like you've got a girlfriend?
Everybody!!
I mean, I don't feel like I even have a girlfriend anymore.
Is this about Mark?
Oh my God.
So what?! Y'know what? The way I see it--Ow! Son of a bitch!!
Y'know what? I am going to do something today. I'm not just gonna sit around like some old lady. I'm gonna get something pierced. Like my uh, like my nose or my tongue or something.
Really?! 'Cause y'know that hurts.
Look Rachel, I know what you're going through. I'm totally freaked about turning 25.
Get out, get out of my apartment.
What?! What?! He was trying to cheer me up! My pony was sick.
Yeah! I've been sailing my whole life. When I was fifteen my dad bought me my own boat.
Your own boat?
Do you know what I was thinkin'?
What?
So I hear the Ralph Lauren fooled around with someone in the copy room.
Ahh....So...Wow...The spring line, it's really going to be great this year, huh?
Yeah.
Tell me everything.
Hey guys.
Ross, you are so pathetic. Why can't your son just play with his doll?
You know what it's fine. If you're okay with the Barbi thing, so am I.
Give daddy the Barbi! Ben, give, give me the Barbi. Okay, how 'bout, don't you want to play with the monster truck? No. Okay, oh, oh, how about a Dino-soilder?
I gotta go to work. Has anybody seen my left boob?
I love that movie.
No, no-no-no. Phoebe, this was my fault and besides y'know what? I'm fine here.
Uh-huh.
Now I know that they said that the umm, the hair straightener started the fire but I think I'm partly at fault. You see, I didn't, I didn't tell you but umm, but I-I had recently refilled the tissues and so y'know let's just face it, that's just kindling! So I think it's better that I stay at Joey's.
Okay. Oh umm, Chandler, Monica is looking for you.
Really?
Oh. Well then, you better go take that back because they're gonna charge you for that.
Here's your lemonade.
I didn't order lemonade.
But...
Go-go-go-go, come on! So uh, what did you find out?
We're just really...very excited about this charity event that we have to go to.
You are beautiful.
Oh, thank you! What's going on?
Here.
Oh! Thank you!
I can get a quick bite to eat, but then I have to come back up here.
I've got some bad news.
What?
Come on sweetie! You've had to work late every night for the past two weeks, what is it this time?
Actually, it's kinda my fault. I-I quit today.
Okay please, you're kidding right?! I wrote that one as a joke for you!
So did you read your evaluation yet?
No! It was marked confidential I just sent it down to Human Resources.
A joke they would appreciate?
I'm thinkin' no.
Okay... Let me put it this way. Anything from Crabtree and Evelyn?
So Pheebs, what do you want for your birthday?
Well, what I really want is for my mom to be alive and enjoy it with me.
Ooh! Bath salts would be nice.
Ooh, okay... good.
Isn't this amazing? I mean, I have never made coffee before in my entire life.
Right. Thanks. It's June. I'm outta here.
Y'know, here's the thing. Even if I could get it together enough to- to ask a woman out,... who am I gonna ask?
That is amazing.
Congratulations.
Well, from me. And I know it's not your big money song, but it's my favorite.
Well, people missed you in there. And in fact, there was actually a request for "Smelly Cat".
Really? From who?
Hi. Uh, did I accidentally drop a condom in your case? It's kind of an emergency.
Yeah. Here you go.
Hi! I'm Rachel. This is Phoebe. I'm the maid of honor. How do you know Monica?
Well, I don't know. I called all the people in Monica's phone book and these are the only ones who could show up on 24 hours notice.
Hmm, y'know there's another word for people like that. Losers!
I was her accountant four years ago.
Ohhhh!
No, y'know what? Maybe somebody came in here and fixed it! Or something!
Well no.
Miracle!
Someone like an...angel?
That's right Joey, the chair angel came in and heeled your chair.
Now that you're on you're own, you're free to look as stupid as you like.
Oh I see, so this suit is making a point.
Right.
You like it right?
Oh absolutely. I like it even more on you than I did on Colonel Sanders. Ross! Ross! I'm kidding!
Okay please tell me that this is just one of your jokes that you do that I don't get.
No seriously, y'know the contracts I gave you, did you overnight them?
What contracts?
Like what?
Y'know, like the thing when you put the phone in your pants? Tag! I'm serious! This isn't funny! Those contracts absolutely had to go out today!
Oh yeah, sorry. Wait honey, so what did you do that made dad cut you off?
Oh! Did you hear that?! My dad's proud of me! My dad's proud of me.
Rach?
Okay, I bought a boat.
You bought a boat?
Oh, stop that! Don't kid about that! Will all the stars be there?
Oh my God! Oh my God!! That is like the third most prestigious soap opera award there is!
Thank you! Well, I guess now I know who I'm taking to the awards.
Many are scheduled to appear.
Oh my God! Oh my God! I can't go! I'm gonna be too nervous!
Thanks, but I gotta go to work and get my eyes scratched out by Mindy.
Get down?
...And boogie!
Relax. Y'know, she may not even know.
Please. I haven't heard from her in seven months, and now she calls me? I mean, what else is it about? Oh! She was my best friend, you guys! We went to camp together... she taught me how to kiss..
No, I have two sisters. But one of them has a very masculine energy.
Well, okay, look. I don't know, listen, I don't know what's going on here but let's...
Do-do you, do you have brothers?
Are you close with them?
No-no, they're not very nice people.
Monica, what are you talking about? You don't know the first thing about the stock market.
Do what?
Put all my money in me.
What's to know? Buy sell, high low, bears bulls... Yes Manhattan...yeah telephone number of the stock...selling store.
See, didn't I tell ya these pillows would be a good idea?
Wow! Look at that, Chip Matthews called. I wonder what he wants?
Good! 'Cause I've got a product report to read, it's like eight pages, I hope I don't fall asleep.
Why? Did you write it?
Well ah, actually...
I bet he sensed that I was ready to have sex with another guy.
No, you're right. Well, we'll find something. Let's just get you out of that. Come on.
Ooooh! Honey, well we'll find you something. Do you wanna wear my black jacket?
That won't go with this dress though.
No, no, no, no, no, no, not out of that, not out of clothes.
Monica, can Phoebe borrow your green dress?
God, Ross, look, what you and I have is special, all Paolo and I ever had was...
Ross, Ross, please listen to me. Ross, you are so much better for me than Paolo ever was. I mean you care about me, you're loving, you make me laugh.
Oh, hey, if I make you laugh, here's an idea, why don't you invite Paulo over and have a little romp in the sack and I'll just stand in the corner and tell knock-knock jokes.
Animal sex, animal sex? So what're you saying, I mean, you're saying that like, there's nothing between us animal at all. I mean there's not even like, uhm, a little animal, not even, not even like, like chipmunk sex?
Ok, Ross, try to hear me. Ok, I, hey, I'm not gonna lie to you. Ok, it was good with Paolo.
Stop it! I will kill you. I hate the fact that my room is so small.
I hate this apartment! I hate the color of these walls! I hate the fact that this place still smells like bird! I hate that singing guy!
Are you kidding? I love that guy! Morning's here! Morning is here-
Hey, I have all the space I need. Just do what I did.
Monica, you don't even have a bed, you sleep in a ball on the floor!
Yes, I know! And Joey knows! But Ross doesn't know so you have to stop screaming!!
I KNOW!! I KNOW!! I KNOW!
YOU KNOW?!!!
What's going on?
Ohhh!!!
What future boyfriends? Nono, I th- I think this could be, y'know, it.
From the nursery rhyme. 'There was a crooked man, Who had a crooked smile, Who lived in a shoe, For a... while...'
...So I think Alan will become the yardstick against which all future boyfriends will be measured.
Really!
Oh, yeah. I'd marry him just for his David Hasselhoff impression alone. You know I'm gonna be doing that at parties, right?
Ohh, are you setting Ross up with someone? Does she have a wedding dress?
No, the one who looked at you once because you got in her way.
Still I could tell. She was into me. Well, why don't you set us up?
Hey.
Hey.
I don't know, y'know? I feel a little umm... No, y'know what? Nevermind, I'm gonna be fine.
Oh, thanks.
You okay over there?
Oh, don't worry about it I mean you probably were tired, you had a lot of champagne, it happens to everybody.
Hey!
And by the way, have I mentioned that back in high school, I was a cow?
God bless the chickpea.
Oh, god, I am so spoiled... That's it!
I used to wet my bed.
I use my breasts to get other people's attention.
Oh my God! Calling from Rome! Bon giorno, caro mio.
Oh, oh, a quality, good, because I was worried you guys were gonna be vague about this.
Hello? Hello? Oh! Rachel, it's Paolo calling from Rome.
So he's calling from Rome. I could do that. Just gotta go to Rome.
Monica, your dad just beeped in, but can you make it quick? Talking to Rome. I'm talking to Rome.
God. I forgot how much I love driving. I have got to get my license renewed.
Okay whatever.
You've seen my huge stack of porn right?
You don't have a valid driver's license-Okay that is it! Pull over right now!
Oh Ross you're so tense! You just gotta relax okay? Just need to relax all right? Just need to relax...
I'm sorry, I was just reading the joke below it. Man, that one is funny.
Hey, tell Dan, 'Thanks.'
What?
Monica, you remember me telling you that joke, right?
No.
What? Come on, you do what you want to do. Do we always have to do everything together?
Why did you look at me when you said that?
Well, I guess now we can't go.
You know what? You're right.
Fine.
No, I'm just kidding I would never do that to you! Okay, everybody, it's trifle time!
Joey, you're gonna have to stop rushing me, you know what? You don't get any dessert.
Really?
So, now, Rach, this is a traditional English trifle, isn't it?
It sure is.
Yeah, honey, maybe you can talk to somebody who's had a baby. Like your mom?
Yeah.
We just want you to think it through.
My mom never gave birth. Oh! But my birth mom did.
Umm, I love this touchy. Can I take it to work with me?
I don't care! I wanna meet this guy who's the best sex she ever had!
Ohh, he's really shy. I-I don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet.
Yeah, I don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet.
Really?! That's what you heard? You said that?
I might've said that. Why is that funny?
Well, you know that my parents are out of town and Chip was going to come over...
Not for me. Chip and I broke up!
Oh, why? Why? What happened?
Yeah, yeah, and you were going him y'know, your flower.
Okay, Monica, can you just call it sex?! It really creeps me out when you call it that! Okay, and by the way, while we're at it, a guy's thing is not called his tenderness. Believe me! Hi!
Oh we were, but that was just a , I mean that was just a big drunken mistake.
Yeah, well my-my ex-wife and I share custody of Ben and umm, uh, and just so you know, Carol and I are on excellent terms as I'm sure you are with your wife! Oh, I'm sorry! It's unbelievable!
Don't worry about it, I just didn't realize you were married.
You're back.
You two were married?!
Uh-huh, yeah I did, because I wore out my first copy when I was with you.
Y'know, I can not believe you told him, Joey!
So I guess you bought that book after we broke up huh?
Oh yeah, yeah? Well uh, when we were going out, I read tons of porno magazines! 'Sup?
Ross! How could you do that to an old man?!
Perfect. Fasten your seatbelts, it's peepee time. Hey, Mr. Trib.
Hey, listen, Ronni, how long would you say Chandler's been in the shower?
Oh, like, uh, five minutes?
Hey. Morning, dear.
Chandler Bing? It's time to see your thing.
So, it's pretty late, you're probably uh, not still planning on. . .
Boy that Julie's a talker, huh?
Goodnight.
Oh, no no, I am.
Oh, well, are hey, are you nervous?
All right, y'know what, come on, do we really have to watch this while we eat?
Then I made the mistake of turning off the TV, I never got it back again. And I'm sad.
Why would he turn off the TV?
Oh no-no-no-no!
We don't know what could make this go away.
Well, remember how we were too drunk to remember anything the night we were married?
Well, y'know this whole marriage thing, kinda my idea.
Excuse me?
Yeah?
And uh, yeah, I didn't really, I didn't want to say anything, but it kinda it just, it kinda kept coming back to me, and umm, remember we were in the casino and for some reason thought it would be funny to eat a lot of grapes. And uh, and I thought it would be funnier if we got married. So as a, as a compromise we decided first to get married, and then to eat a lot of grapes. So umm, sorry I got us into this mess.
All right, you know what? I am not leaving here, until you call that plane back!!
Look, If I don't get to London!! He is going to marry that other girl!!!
I can't imagine why.
I'm getting married today!! Whoo-hoo!!
Morning, Ross.
Oh my God, it's so huge, but you just have to promise me that you cannot tell anyone.
Okay. Okay. Okay. Joey, I have got to tell you something!
What-what is it, what is it?
Oh no, no-no-no-no! I don't want to know!
Yes! Yes! Yes, you do want to know! This is unbelievable!
Well, I didn't see Joshua last night, but I did punch a girl in the face.
Hey-whoa, slow down. No, keep moving. Wow!
So? How did it go with Joshua last night?
What?
Why?
Please! During that second time you couldn't have picked her out of a lineup!
Even when we were having sex in that chair?
I swear, whatever I was doing, I was always thinking of you.
You did it twice?
Well, the first time didn't really count... I mean, y'know, 's'Barry.
I ah... Oh! I'll squeeze you fresh orange juice every morning!
I ah, will buy and wrap all of your Christmas gifts.
No!
With extra pulp?
Yeah!!
And you've got lenses! But you hate sticking your finger in your eye!
Oh! Well, um.. You've got plugs!
Careful! They haven't quite taken yet.
Not for her. Listen, I really wanted to thank you.
Okay..
Hello? Uh, Rachel. Great, someone is in our apartment. Call the cops!
You just thought of that in there?
Yeah sure, nature called, she wanted to see who else did.
You're on the phone!
Oh my God! Oh my God! Thank you! That was the fire department, there was a fire at our place!
Well, I was kinda supposed to be headed for Aruba on my honeymoon, so nothing!
Shut up, Joey!
So Rachel, what're you, uh... what're you up to tonight?
Right, you're not even getting your honeymoon, God.. No, no, although, Aruba, this time of year... talk about your- -big lizards... Anyway, if you don't feel like being alone tonight, Joey and Chandler are coming over to help me put together my new furniture.
Yes, and we're very excited about it.
Y'know what Chandler, you got yourself into those cuffs, you get yourself out of them.
And the fact that you were jeopardising my career never entered your mind?!
It did enter my mind! But then something happened that made it, shoot right out.
No-no-no-no-no-no-no!! I can't get myself right out of them! You must have me confused with the Amazing Chandler!! Come on, you have to unlock me, she could be gone for hours, and I'm cold, and
Oh, Chandler!! All right, this is it! You never see Joanna again!
Oh no, wait a minute, wait, I've got a presentation tomorrow. I can't miss that.
Well, I guess I could take a couple days off work.
Of course you can take a couple days off work because this trip includes me!
Oh, but I've got tickets to the Van Gogh exhibit! I've been waiting like a year for this.
Art lover!
Oh my God. Can you imagine if there was?! I mean, what would happen exactly.
Okay. Uh, well can we, can we get you anything Mr. Zelner? Maybe some chocolates?
Umm, no. Thanks, but I'll give these to Betty. So I read your evaluation of Tag, or to use his full name, Tag Sweetcheeks Jones. Is something going on with you two?
Well, I'd be forced to file a report. I'd have to consult with the legal department, and your future at the company would be in jeopardy.
Well...
Y'know I can't believe I even thought about getting back together again! We are so over!!
You fell asleep?!
It was 5:30 in the morning, and you had rambled on for 18 pages. Front and back!! Oh-oh-oh, and by the way, Y-O-U-apostrophe-R-E means 'you are,' Y-O-U-R means 'your!'
FINE BY ME!!
Oh, oh, and hey-hey-hey, those little spelling tips will come in handy when you're at home on Saturday nights playing Scrabble with Monica!!
Ok, ok, so you're not a fan, but I mean, come on, you cannot do this to her.
But what about Phoebe?
Rachel, it's not that your friend is bad, it's that she's so bad, she makes me want to put my finger through my eye into my brain and swirl it around.
Uh--
Oh, no no no no. Oh no no no no. I have to do this to her?
I will wake you up in a way that's proved very popular in the past.
For every night that you're asleep before I get home from work...
Yeah.
Now, if you need to stay late, I want to be supportive of that.
Right.
Uh, morning. Do you guys think you could close your eyes for just a sec?
Please, just a little bit off the back.
I'm still on "no."
No-no-no-no-no, I'm not fallin' for that again.
What's goin' on?
Yeah. Oh, yeah. And I mean, the connection, I mean y'know, emotionally, mentally, physically...
Oh, no-no-no, no-no-no, it has become, it has-yeah. Oh no, those were four great dates.
Oh. Yeah?
Wow, that's-that's-that's incredible.
I know isn't it? It's like I'm right there with Joshua.
Hey, nice pillow. So now tell me, is this genuine Muppet skin?
Art it is.
Look, check this out. Is it a coffee table, is it a panther? There's no need to decide.
Hey, excellent, excellent water-table thing.
Thanks, yeah. I love this but ya know what, it makes me wanna pee.
Yeah, when we're in the audience he doesn't talk to us, but he does wave.
I eat by myself in the alley because everybody hates me.
Look, Ross, really it's-it's no big deal. Y'know you wear a white coat, I wear a blue blazer, if that means we can't be friends at work, then so be it. Y'know, hey I understand. Y'know? Hey, when I'm in a play and you're in the audience, I don't talk to you, right? So it's y'know, it's uh, it's cool. I'll see you tomorrow.
Hi.
Hey!
Yeah! Yeah. They're...they're-they're my friends, uh, Monica Stephanopolus and uh, and Chandler Acidofolus.
Anastassakis/Papasifakis wedding, excellent! {It's a good thing Jennifer Aniston is Greek, because she had to pronounce those names. Luckily for me, they were written on a sign.} Congratulations. Mazel Tov! Hi! Oh, great hat. Listen umm, I need you to perform another wedding. Can you do that?
I don't know. Are they Greek Orthodox?
Hi! Hi! Hi. Has umm, anyone seen Chandler?
I thought he was with you.
Wow, you know what? That is the best fake speech I think I've ever heard.
Hey, it's Phoebe and Rachel. Um, why don't you tell them what you were telling me earlier about me not being high maintenance?
Monica is a self-sufficient, together lady. Being with her has been like being on a vacation. And what may be perceived as high maintenance is merely attention to detail and--generosity of spirit.
Really? I've heard better.
Wait, wait, he came up with that himself. Tell them, Chandler.
I don't know. We were watching TV, and then he pooped in Monica's shoe-
Now, now the one in the feather boa, that's Dr. Francis. Now, she used to be a man. Okay, now look, see, there's Raven. We hate her. We're glad she's dying. Okay- Wh- wh- Marcel, are you playing with Monica's shoes? You know you're not supposed to pl- whoah. Marcel, did you poo in the shoe? Marcel, bad monkey! Oh! Oh! Sorry, Barry. Little engagement gift. I'm sure you didn't register for that. Who died? Who died? Roll him over! Oh, c'mon, roll him over! Oh...! Well, we know it wasn't Dexter, right Marcel? Because- Marcel? Marc-
How could you lose him?
Wait. He pooped in my shoe? Which one?
I don't know. The left one.
I just y'know, I didn't expect him to be this happy so soon. Ufff. Ooo-ooh!
Yes.
So?
Oh no.
What?
No! Forget it! I am not gonna ask Frank to give you one of his kids!!
Me?!
I can't ask him! Do you have any idea how inappropriate that would be?! All I'm saying is just talk to Frank. Okay? Just, y'know, feel him out!
You're right.
Tell him it's for you.
Monica, y'know what? The only reason I did that was because your party was so boring!
Ahh, third base.
It's all everybody at the party could talk about!
We had a characturist!
Oh!!
Oh hell, he's done this three times! He knows what its about!
Oh no wait no, this is wrong! Ross isn't here!
Oh...
Yeah!
Hey, what's going on?
Well then honey, buy the lamp! Hey, we have that 60 bucks from Ross.
Okay! Okay-okay look-no I did, I just wanted this stuff and I know how you feel about Pottery Barn. Just... Come on don't be mad.
No-no-no, but I am mad! I am mad! Because this stuff is everything that is wrong with the world! And it's all sitting up in my living room and all I can think about is how I don't have that lamp!
I can't! I can't! Unless... Well are you saying that-that you would move out if-if I didn't buy that lamp?
What?! No! I'm not gonna move out!
But I thought that ring stood for Caprice's undying love for her brother.
No! No-no-no...
Yes! Yes!! And every time you look at it, I want you to remember that you are a good person. Okay, you've had the chance to cheat, and with me, but you didn't. And that's what this ring stands for.
Look, do you want the ring or not?!
Yeah!
Oh, I am, my side still hurts from when you crashed into me yesterday.
Oh, please.
What? Honey.
Oh God, I'm so sorry.
I know.
Okay, Pheebs, quick, what shoes should I wear? The black or the purple?
Duh!! Christmas!
Okay, hey, that's okay with me. Two down and I have exactly twelve minutes.... Wha, my watch stopped. My watch. Okay, see, the, the dinosaur tail isn't going around any more. What time is it? It's 7:33, I have seven minutes. I have seven minutes!!
Just, just, just pick one!
Okay, okay, okay, the black. But, oh, do you have black, with the little strappys?
All right, easy mimey, the moment has passed, it ain't gonna happen!
Oh please! Why else would you have made out with Ross?!
Got me.
I just thought it would be nice if I could have just this one night!
I swear, I never wanted any part of your night!
Why are you adding, why are you adding, why are you adding, why are you adding?
No, no, no now in all seriousness, its not a lot of women would've had the guts to come back here tonight, and even fewer, who would do it with their asses hanging out!
Uh, I like to, uh, to add something to that...
Most of you don't know me, I'm Rachel's boyfriend.
Oh dear God.
Well yeah, I wish that you would. Well, no it's not in there! How about that drawer?
Oh my God! Did you check your entire desk! Did you check all the drawers!
Do you want me to check again?
Well, it's not out here. Is there any chance it could be in your office?
Y'know, I don't-I don't know. Let me, let me check.
Okay, oh, here's what you do. Just act like everything around you turns you on.
Then, you will definitely get him back!
Okay, so how do I make him think I wanna have sex with him?
What do you mean?
Well, like anything can be sexy. Like umm, oh-oh, like this dishtowel! Ooh, ooh, this feels sooo good against my cheek! And-and if I feel a little hot, I can just dab myself with it. Or I can bring it down to my side and bring it through my fingers while I talk to him.
Okay, I'm just gonna go over the basic points just one more time, are you ready?
Joey, just ignore the boats all right? We're not finished with the lesson yet.
All right.
Come on Rach, not again. I got it! Okay? Let's start sailing, and I want to go over there where that boatload of girls is! Yo-ho-ho!
Oh, okay. Is that what you want to do? You wanna go over and give a little shout out to the old, hot chickas? Okay, let's do that Sailor Joe. Quick question though, what's this called?
Yeah, and none of these stupid grocery questions, real personal questions.
All right! Ten buck! Fork it over! Cough it up! Pay the piper! Gimme it.
That does not mean you know us better, I-I want a rematch.
Yeah! And the winner gets a hundred bucks.
Serious?
Really? Okay. Okay, I-I'll go upstairs. If-if you get me something from the car.
Good. Good. Not that we don't want you to stay, obviously you're welcome-How much more homework do you have?
Ahh, I just have one problem left that I do not know how to solve. Uhh, Rachel maybe you want to come upstairs and help me figure it out?
What do you need from the car?
Surprise me.
That's great! Wow man, so Joey must've really taught you some stuff huh?
Oh.
And I never used to be able to just talk to girls in bars, but I got like 20 phone numbers last night.
A little.
Yeah?
Wow, y'know if Joey and Chandler walked in right now, we could make a fortune!
Monica! Stop it!
Damn! It's empty!
Ooh that is definitely Chandler, Joey, or Ross. Or-or Rachel!
Hello? It's Joey. I'm so glad you called! Chandler told me what happened. Y'know he's really upset about it.
What, what, so that you can dance with the woman that stole your credit card?
What are you doing?
Alright, great. Thanks a lot. I'm going to tap class.
This woman's got my life, I should get to see who she is.
Go to the post office! I'm sure her picture's up! ...Okay, Monica, y'know what, honey, you're kinda losing it here! I mean, this is really becoming like a weird obsession thing.
Yeah, and could you please chop some up and just put it right there in the sauce?
With ah, extra anchovies.
That's okay, I'll just pick 'em off.
You can have the last piece, if you want.
Well, I should think so. You slept with someone.
Oh, yeah, I had too. There was never any parking by the Psychology building.
Fine, all right, mine had a dwarf that got broke in half, but y'know whatever.
So Rachel, your mom tells me you changed your major again.
Hi Rachel.
Oh hi!
Umm, Chandler, you do realize that those ideas are probably already in Monica's head.
And that crazy party animal will be your brother-in-law.
Very, very funny, but don't say things like that in front of Monica. I don't want you putting any ideas in her head.
Wh-wh-why?!
Well, because she loves you and because you love her.
Y'know, you-you also could've used uh, lamps and then followed the light.
This switch thing has been driving me crazy. So I turned it off and checked every outlet. Now, four of them don't work. Which means, one of them has to be controlled by the switch. So, I plugged in things in all four of the outlets that-that make noise, so that way, when I turn it on I just follow the noise and find out which one it is.
I bet I stopped listening before you did.
Yeah, well, I'm using noise. Okay. All right! So, is everybody ready? Here we go. I hear something! I hear something! Where is it?
It's coming from Joey!
Ok, uh, Billy Dreskin, Pete Carney, Barry, and uh, oh, Paolo.
Well, there's you.
Better not be doin' these in order.
Oh yes, the weenie from Torrini.
Oh honey, are you jealous of Paolo? Oh, c'mon, I'm so much happier with you than I ever was with him.
Okay, well can't you just try it one more time Ross? For me? For me?
Okay, look, Ross, I realise that my Father is difficult, but that's why you have got to be the bigger man here.
Look sweetie, I could be the bigger man, I could be the biggest man, I could be a big, huge, giant man, and it still wouldn't make any difference, except that I could pick your Father up and say 'Like me! Like me tiny doctor!'
Rachel one brunch is not gonna solve anything. You gotta face it, okay we're never gonna get along.
Okay, well you are just gonna have too, okay. Because I already got a Mother and a Father who cannot stay in the same room together, okay, I don't wanna have to have a separate room for you too!!
Oh, well, we can hand it to Gunther and he'll put it in lost and found.
All right, straight, and not subtle.
Ohh, he left his cell phone.
Or we could use it to call China. See how those guys are doing.
What if, um, if he calls his own cell phone to find out who found it and I answer and we start talking and we fell in love. I mean wouldn't that be a great story? Kind of like a fairy tale for the digital age.
Well, y'know, a little of this, a little of that. Got myself a date tomorrow night.
Sorry.
What happened?
See, didn't I tell you?! You're getting over Ross already!
Well...
Ross! I just had a conversation with her, and she said that she and Joey made a deal!
Phoebe?! Wait a-but-but she just, she said that Joey was her backup.
Ohh, I don't think so.
That's impossible! I mean we have had a deal for years! We-we-we shook on it, although believe me she wanted to do a lot more than that.
Where the hell have you been?!
Okay, you are crazy! I'm sorry, but she sounded generally upset! I mean, listen!
Ugh!
Y'know what, this is obviously some kind of twisted joke she's trying to play on him.
Your messages have been erased.
Noooooooo!
Wow, he's cute, Pheebs! But I thought you just started dating that Kindergarten teacher.
Look, I gotta go. I'm on call tonight. See you Saturday.
Okay.
Oh, Jason? Yeah, uh-huh, we're seeing each other tonight.
What-Pheebs?! Two dates in one day? That's so unlike you.
Honey, why is it hard, I mean we've been together for almost a year now?
A big idiot.
A big idiot. Just you have to realize is, this whole Mark thing is kinda hard for me.
Well, I was with Carol for like eight years and I lost her. And now if it's possible I think I love you even more. So, it's hard for me to believe that I'm not gonna, well that someone else is not going to take you away.
Let it be me! Let it be me!
Sure Pheebs, you know, that's what it's there for, emergencies and pretend agents.
Yeah, Joe, I assure you if I'm staring down the barrel of a gun, I'm pretty much peeing every which way.
Oh, it's your audition from this morning. Can I use the phone again?
Come on baby, come on!
'Hi, I have Phoebe Buffay returning a page. Okay, well, um, she's in her car I'll have to patch you through.'
Pheebs, I don't know what to say. I guess the flea market was just better last time.
She does want to.
Yeah!
Well at least I got these sheets for Ross.
Yeah.
Oh my god. Oh my god. Excuse me. Move! Move! Emergency! Excuse me!
Come on, they're gonna love you.
Ok, so this is pretty much what's happened so far. Ross was in love with Rachel since, you know, forever, but every time he tried to tell her, something kind of got in the way, like cats, and Italian guys. Finally Chandler was like "forget about her" but when Ross was in China on his dig, Chandler let it slip that Ross was in love with Rachel. She was like, "Oh my god." So she went to the airport to meet him when he came back, but what she didn't know was, that Ross was getting off the plane with another woman. Uh-Oh! So, that's pretty much everything you need to know. But, enough about us. So, how've you been?
Rach!
Oh, there you are! Hi! Oh, so, so, how was China, you?
That sounds great! I'd love to live at Warren's!! I love Warren! Thank you!
Yeah! Why?
Okay, there's this guy, Warren, from the museum and he's going on a dig for like two years and he's got this great place he needs to sublet. So uh, you interested?
Don't thank me! If you wanna thank something, thank the volcano that erupted thousands of years ago, killing but perfectly preserving an entire civilization. Here's Warren's number.
Oh, this is great! I am gonna call him right now! Oh, thank you!
Ohh, you should know, this place is a real babe magnet. Wanna make out?
Whoa-whoa, there's two living rooms? God, growing up here, this place must've been a real babe magnet.
Yeah, well, it would've been, but uh, my parents just moved here.
Hey, here's an idea. Why don't uh, I put the food in the fridge and we can eat it later?
That sounds like a plan. Umm, is there a place I can go freshen up?
Well, y'know what? Actually, I was about to bid on this lovely trip to Paris.
Well, y'know I-I don't know where he is.
Well, I hope you're gonna bid on some things Rachel.
Ohh, nice choice.
Yeah.
Umm, you-you and your sister seem to have umm, a very special bond, and...
Yeah uh, y'know what uh, let's skip it.
What?! Why?!
Oh great! That special bond again! Why do women have such a problem with the fact that I'm close with my sister?
Well, okay, look. I don't know, listen, I don't know what's going on here but let's...
She'll be out in a second. So, Chip, how's umm, Amy Welch?
I'm great! I'm great. I've got a great job at Bloomingdale's, have wonderful friends, and eventhough I'm not seeing anyone right now, I've never felt better about myself.
So ah, Monica ready yet?
Amy Welch? Wow! I haven't seen her since... So, Monica about ready?
This is the unit for you my friend. Sturdy construction, tons of storage compartments, some big enough to fit a grown man.
Yeah, we're, we're actually just gonna walk 'cause it's right up there at the Angelica.
Oh but Phoebe, we're gonna be late for the movie.
Oh, there's a cab! Taxi!! Good timing, my God, huh? Here you go.
Oh, the Angelica!! Go! Go! You didn't get the annulment?!!
I know.
Oh, nothing, he's just goofy like that, I actually, hardly notice it anymore.
Bye, Chandler.
So ah, what's wrong with him?
Oh no, no-no-no, is he ah, married, or involved with anyone?
No!! No! He's not married, or involved, with anyone!
Here you go Pheebs. Who else wants one of my special homemade brownies?
Oh my God.
Varrrrrroom! Hey! Watch it lady! Varrrrrrrrrrom! Hey-hey good lookin'! Varrrrrrrrroom. All right, I'll leave. My bed's so boring.
I will have one.
Okay, I'm not gonna have one.
Ooh, goooosh, ooh, these are cookies smashed in the sports section.
What?
Uhhh, I don't think you're gonna like this.
Oh look, and he did my crossword puzzle.
Yeah, but not very well, unless 14-across, 'Gershwin musical' actually is bitemebitemebitemebiteme.
Monica and Chandler are really moving in here and I have to move out and everything is changing.
I do not have feelings for Rachel! Okay?!
Ohh, what's wrong?!
Oh my-Come here! Come here! It's okay. Everything's gonna be okay.
Thank you.
And I still have about five seconds to spare. Okay, that was about seven seconds.
Yeah, after this, I think he'll be doing that himself.
Rachel!! Wow! You, uh, you look, wow!
So we're a little late.
Come on. Oh! And, uh, by the way....
You and your stupid fear. I hate your fear. I would like to take you and your fear....
No, it's not gonna be okay Ross, tomorrow is my last day, and I don't have a lead. Okay, y'know what, I'm just gonna, I'm just gonna call Gunther and I'm gonna tell him, I'm not quitting.
You-you-you don't wanna give into the fear.
Hey! I got great news!
Run, Joey! Run for your life!
Remember when we went to Central Park and rented boats?.. That was fun.
Relieved?
Yeah, well, I had a great time with you.. I just can't stand your friends.
Yeah. He could row like a viking.
Hi.
Yeah? Okay! Good, good, because he's coming. He's coming. Hey, what's up?
Well, like anything can be sexy. Like umm, oh-oh, like this dishtowel! Ooh, ooh, this feels sooo good against my cheek! And-and if I feel a little hot, I can just dab myself with it. Or I can bring it down to my side and bring it through my fingers while I talk to him.
I can do that!
Monica, I was wondering if you can make me some of that righteous mac and cheese like last year.
Umm, I'd love too! Ooh, I love macaroni and cheese. I love-I love the way this box feels against my cheek.
Well excuse me, my fashion-impaired friends, I am here to tell you that hats are back.
Ohh, thank you.
Buy it for ya, or win it for ya?
And this time, they've ganged up to form one giant, super hat.
Go, go, go!
Wow! H-umm! Hi! Yes, uh I'm sorry the models are actually down the hall.
All right. I'm a total pro!
Hello?
Actually, I'm here about the assistant job.
Really?! Okay well then, all right, well just have a seat there. Umm, so what's-what is-what's your name?
Yes, absolutely. I would wait and wait. . . then I'd wait some more.
I'd wait.
You'd wait?
Really?
Oh yeah, I don't care how much she tells you she wants it, I don't care if begs, she pleads, she tells you she, she's gonna have sex with, with another man. That just means it's working.
Well you know, after about thirty or forty fights, you kinda catch on.
And it works both ways.
Okay, so you both just know this stuff?
Okay, for instance. Let's say, Janice is coming back from a trip and she gives you two options. Option number 1 she'll take a cab home from the airport. Option 2 is you can meet her at baggage claim. Which do you do?
That's easy, baggage claim.
All right, listen, missy. If you want this cart, you're gonna have to take me with it!
Hey, hey, hey, hey, quit making up rules!
Let go!
Yes! Did you see that?
You were incredible! Brand new woman, ladies and gentlemen.
Well Joey, I hate to admit it, your way of sailing is a lot more fun.
They never did, so if ever see me giving them legal advice just nod along. Shall we?
So I guess we wear swimsuits in here!
Yeah, yeah. Hey, why don't you give a pull on that rope?
Ohh we're not sailing.
All right, well, you're right, these are the best oatmeal cookies I've ever had.
Ok, thanks Pheebs Oh my God, why have I never tasted these before?!
Oh, I don't make them a lot because I don't think it's fair to the other cookies
Which proves that I never lie.
I guess you don't.
Okay Joey, we're luffing a little bit, so could you tighten up the cunningham?
No! No-no, no-no-no, very quiet, said with love, no yelling.
Oh, y'know what? Since I'm here, I think I'm gonna have me a little beer on the port side.
Uh, wow, you just said a bunch of stuff I didn't know there.
Joey, come on! We just went over this!
Monica, what did you mean before when you said you didn't want to talk to anyone, especially me?
Oh, give her the deposit! Give her the ring! I don't care!
Yes.
What a great apology! And you accept! Okay, bye-bye!
No-no, seriously-seriously, what was the especially me part about?
Monica, Monica, look at this lamp. Is this tacky or what? We have to have this.
Hey, there's me! April 17th. Excessive noise. Italian guy comes homes with a date. Hey Chandler, look, you're in here too.
April 18th, excessive noise. Italian guy's gay roommate comes home with the dry-cleaning. Well that's excellent.
Rache, I think we have enough regular lamps.
What? Come on, it's not like I'm asking for this girly clock or anything, which, by the way, I also think is very cool.
Noooo, no, I'm not mad at him. I'm.. I'm not really anything at him anymore.
What? What is so strange about me having a date?
What about Ross? I mean, are you still mad at him cause he made that list about you?
What are you talking about?
I don't know. Whatever I was feeling, I'm... not.
Well, sure, but they might think it's kinda weird considering I don't work there anymore.
Yeah.
I'm, uhh, making up flyers trying to get new massage clients. So, can I come to Bloomingdale's and use the copy machine.
Oh my God. What happened?
I-I, got a job at Ralph Lauren.
But you-you said black. Why would he want his blue blazer black?
What?
Blue blazer back. He-he wants it back.
Well, you-you know what I meant.
No, you messed it up. You're stupid.
Oh but he did say that they found the grandmother wandering down fifth avenue.
Ross said there's still no word from Chandler.
Oh man.
Okay. Well there's one down.
I'm getting married today!!! I think I just cracked a rib. But I don't care because today's my wedding day! My day is finally here!!
Yeah! It's an apothecary table. Does anyone even know what an apothecary is?
Monica look! Look-look-look! Here is that table that I ordered.
You got it from Pottery Barn?!
A pharmacist.
Rach, Phoebe hates Pottery Barn.
I mean, do you think there are people who go through life never having that kind of...
No, he said we were holding up the people behind us.
And you didn't marry him because...?
Probably. But you know, I'll tell you something. Passion is way overrated.
Yeah right.
He just kept asking, and asking, and asking, and asking, and asking, and asking.
Agh, what a jerk. I kept talking about you and he kept asking me out. I mean, naturally, you know, I said no.
Well, thanks anyway.
Rachel if you, if you want to go out with him, you can. Sound like a big jerk to me but if that's what you want to do...
Jean-Claude she said yes, I'll see you tonight. Thank you.
I'm training to be better at a job that I hate, my life officially sucks.
Come on! All the cool kids are eating 'em!
And when you have a second later, I wanna show you why we don't just trap spiders under coffee mugs and leave them there.
Look Rach, wasn't this supposed to a temporary thing? I thought you wanted to do fashion stuff?
Well, yeah! I'm still pursuing that.
...we went back the house and we got really silly and we...we made out.
Remember?! We-come on both had the sarongs on, and we had the-the coconut bikini tops...
Yeah?
Oh wow, Ray-ray I have no idea what you're talking about.
Really?!
No! You gotta get me out of here Phoebe! These bargain shoppers are crazy!
Okay! Hey! What do I do?!! What are you doing? Did you find the dress?
Did you find the dress?
I-We gotta get Monica.
No! You gotta hold my hand!!
Okay. Okay. It's-since you've never done it before you can be Monica's made of honor.
Yeah but Phoebe...
And no, oh please, oh please let me finish. Oh I guess that was it.
Oh, thank you so much! Okay.
I'm gonna marry someone good y'know.
Well, where is he? He is supposed to be here. What if the baby needs him?
Yeah, well, it's an important day. I wanna look nice. Um, has uh Dr. Franzblau been by?
No, I haven't seen him.
Rachel, what is the deal with you and doctors, anyway? Was, like, your father a doctor?
Yeah, why?
Okay? Wait okay, tell-tell me that you like him, please? I mean tell me that you like him.
So how's it goin' with Joey?
Uh, okay.
Look, he's a really great guy and I know that you really want this to work out, but I just don't see this having a future.
But you said that you liked him! I mean what happened?! Did ya just change your mind?!
Okay, my boss, Joanna, when you left, she started asking questions about you...
I-I know. Well if something comes up...
Oh, I'm glad you guys are past that little awkward phase.
Oh-ho, liked what she saw, huh? Dug my action, did she? Checkin' out the Chan-Chan man!
That was surreal. Okay, what do think? Are you interested at all?
It's not here Pheebs, it's not here. Ohh, I went to Joey and Chandler's last night! Okay!
No you didn't.
All right, I already didn't give them back to you, that's what I said. Where is that other earring?
Make sure you check Chandler's jewelry box.
Wait a minute. Chandler has a jewelry box?
So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped?
A lot.
Mm.
Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN...
Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated?
Y'know what? I think we can just leave it at that. It's kinda like a symbolic gesture...
C'mon, cut. Cut, cut, cut,...
Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut...
Rachel! That was a library card!
Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut..
Julie! Julie, isn't that great? I mean, isn't that just kick-you-in-the-crotch, spit-on-your-neck fantastic?
Well, Ross and I were in grad school together.
But we haven't seen each other since then. Well I land in China, guess who's in charge of the dig.
It's an expression.
Well, we just wanted to say a quick hi, and then we're gonna go see the baby.
All right, fine, but don't get mad at me. It's-it's just a little hard to believe.
What is the matter with you?!
What is the matter with you?!! Why aren't you more upset?! Aren't you gonna be sad that we're not gonna be living together anymore?! I mean aren't you gonna miss me at all?!
What's hard to believe?
Well y'know, it's you guys. You-you do this kind of stuff! Y'know? I mean, you-you were gonna get married in Vegas and then you backed out! I guess I'm not upset because I don't see you guys going through with it. I'm sorry.
Here we go. I'm serving my last cup of coffee. There you go. Enjoy.
That's great! Hey! Excellent!
Oh, God bless us, everyone.
Should I tell her I ordered tea?
No.
Yeah that's right you weren't thinking! Y'know what? Let me give you something to think about!
Well, it doesn't sound like it! I mean, it's pretty easy not to kiss someone, you just don't kiss them! See look at us, right now, not kissing!
Let me finish, okay? She started kissing me and-and I didn't stop it. I guess I-I just wasn't thinking...
Oh wait-hold it! But then I started thinking and I stopped the kissing.
Oh, well thank you for taking your tongue out of my sister's mouth long enough to tell me that.
Ross, Chandler wrote something about me on his computer and he won't let me see.
Well what is it? Let me see.
Hey, someone order a coat?
He won't? He won't! Because, isn't that, isn't that the, the short story you were writing?
Yes, yes it is, short story, that I was writing.
Yep. Oh, yeah, look you great. Oh yeah. Yeah, this looks great. Umm, so you like it?
Oh! Well, as a single woman, who is available, I think you look great!
Huh. Yeah?
I do. I do. I love it. In fact, I think I'm gonna wear it home.
Great.
Oh my God! Joey Tribbiani from Days of Our Lives, just walked in here!
Oh yeah. Right. So now, are-do you, do you still do music?
Sometimes, you should come over sometime! I'll play you one of my other...
Rach, he's a friend of ours.
You are friends with Dr. Drake Remoray?
Okay, good. Now that since you know, when you come over would you mind actually using it?
Well, here's another question for ya. Uhh, do you know what that silver knob on the toilet does?
Sure! It flushes it.
Hello!
Hey! Ah!!
Well, is Ross home? Maybe I'll just call him to see if he's actually seen her.
Hey! Have you guys seen Jill? I can't find her anywhere.
No, I haven't.
Who is it?
It's Phoebe! Phoebe!
Hey! Wait a minute! That was different! I did those things because I was in love with you!
Oh, name one stupid thing that is as stupid as this one!
Okay, how about you flew to London to stop my wedding! Ah, how about you told me you loved me after I was already married!
Yeah! Right!
You're right. That's very different. So let's, let's just sign the papers. All right? What?
Okay, see now, what I just heard, blah-blah-blah, blah-blah-blah-blah-blah, blah-blah-blah, blah, blah.
Well okay, how about four hours in a freezing museum auditorium listening to Professor Pitstains and he's 'Hey everybody! Remember that thing that's been dead for a gazillion years. Well there's this little bone we didn't know it had!'
First of all it's Professor Pittain! And second of all, that little bone, proved that, that particular dinosaur had wings, but didn't fly.
Y'know what, 100 million people went to see a movie about what I do, I wonder how many people would go see a movie called, Jurassic Parka.
Oh, that is so...
So. Ross, I've bugged him about this a million times, he's not gonna change.
Yes, it bothers me Ross, but y'know if he was a regular at the coffee house, I'd be serving him sneezers.
So?
You really serve people sneezers?
Well um, I don't.
No-no! Don't dance for me! Please? Don't! What is the matter with you guys?
That's right Patrick, bye-bye!
Eldad is much more cooperative! And he can dance! You dance for Rachel!
Yeah, okay, let's talk it out.
I... Am I the only one that this is embarrassing for?
Okay, stop what you're doing, I need envelope stuffers, I need stamp lickers.....
Oh my God, how did you do that?
Okay, the other night I was leaving the museum just as 'Laser Floyd' was letting out of the planetarium, without even trying I sold 50 boxes! That's when it occurred to me, the key to my success, 'The Munchies.' So I ah, started hitting the new dorms around midnight. I am selling cookies by the case. They call me 'Cookie Dude!'
Well hey, who did these resumes for ya?
Me! On my computer.
Yeah. So Frank, three babies. Whew, that just seems like a lot, huh?
Oh, honey, don't worry. She's gonna make it on time.
Yeah.
Not to me.
Yeah, fair enough.
You...are...not going to believe it! Joshua came into work today, and guess what happened?
Ross, come on! Get in the bloody scrum! Ross, get in!
JOEY!!!!!!
He asked you out?!
No. But I was showing him some cufflinks and I felt his pulse.
Okay, Phoebe, honey, you gotta be kidding. I mean, you know you cannot keep one of these babies!
I want to keep one.
Ohh, I'm gonna be on the news!
Why not?! Maybe I can, you don't know!
Yes! Yes! Yes, I do! I do know! Frank and Alice are gonna want to keep all of their children!
I know! It's like I'm being punished for not having this disgusting, poisoning habit!
...and then they came back from smoking and they had made all of the decisions without me!
That doesn't seem fair.
Yeah, it is the best.
I mean what if this keeps happening? Y'know, they'll-they'll be outside smoking, making all the decisions and I'll just be up in my office breathing my stupid clean air, y'know? And then when the day comes when Kim wants to promote one of us, who do you think she's gonna pick? Me or Smokey Smokerson?
Do you really not know where I'm going with this? It left! It's one huge room!
And remember how you always said you were afraid the landlord would find out and then tear it down?
Yeah?
Oh no! Oh! Wow!!!
See?
Well, I'm really sick of your smoking, so I brought something that is going to help you quit.
No-no, why don't you hang on to that one.
Okay, that's like the least fun game ever.
Oh. Nope, that patch is no good.
Come on, it's a hypnosis tape. This woman at work used it for two weeks straight and she hasn't smoked since.
No-no-no, no, honey please, I've got, I've just have so much to deal with.
Well, there was a disaster in shipping and I've got to get this order in. Honey, I'm so sorry, but it looks like I'm gonna be here all night.
What, do you, well umm, oh how about I come up there?
Anyway, I'm going out with Sergei again tonight, and um, could you come and be the translator's date? So that when we, it's time for our alone time, you two could split off. Y'know, he's really, he's kinda cute.
Yeah, well kinda cute, like really kinda cute, or kinda cute like your friend Spackel Back Larry?
Uh, I-I had a drink with lunch. Did those cost reports come in?
Oh, well drop and give me ten more!
What?
Yeah, I filled them out last night?
Oh, great could you make me four copies of those?
Hey-hey, you guys oh hurry up, get some, there's a whole cart outside...
Excuse me, I'm standing right here!
Oh yes, there you are.
Goodbye Geller.
Now, hold on! Hold on! Look, look, your daughter and I are supposed to leave tonight for our honeymoon, now-now you-you tell her that I'm gonna be at that airport and I hope that she'll be there too! Oh yeah, I said Rachel's name, but it didn't mean anything, Okay? She's-she's just a friend and that's all! That's all! Now just tell Emily that I love her and that I can't imagine spending my life with anyone else. Please, promise me that you'll tell her that.
Umm, I said I thought you were a good kisser, and uh, and that I like your tiney-tiny touchie.
I'm thinkin' no.
What did you say?!
No, not my touchie.
Well, it gets worse. When asked if you take initiative I wrote, "Yes, he was able to unhook my bra with minimal supervision," and under Problems with Performance I wrote, "Dear God, I hope not," and then uh, then I drew a little smiley face, and then a small pornographic sketch.
Really? Oh thank you! Oh... Oh, would it be completely inappropriate to give you a hug?
Oh! You are?
Um-hmm.
Yes!
Okay, well then how about a handshake? Oh God I'm sorry! Oh God, I'm sorry! I did not mean to touch that-I mean you there. There. Uhh, okay, so thank-thank you, I'm going to leave now thank you very much uh-huh, thank you so-Hey! I'll see you Monday!
Yeah, kicking a guy in the crotch all morning really takes it out of ya!
Ohh! We went to a self-defense class today!
Wow!
Takes it out of you?
Now, we can kick anybody's ass!
Yeahh, but, but those really go better with pants. Maybe I should wear pants?
Just, just, just pick one!
Okay, okay, okay, the black. But, oh, do you have black, with the little strappys?
Yeah, pants, what, what an idea. Or better yet, um, how 'bout you go without any pants. Look, I don't know what you're trying to do to me, but just get your butt in there and pick out any shoes that fit your feet, okay. No, no I don't care if they match. I don't care if they make your ankles or your knees or your earlobes look fat. Okay.
But I...
I'm going to find out if he really thinks supermodels are too skinny. Hey, Pheebs!
Yeah, he likes porn.
Where ya going?
Hey.
Hey!
Absolutely. Shoop, shoop, shoop. Only a hundred and two dollars to go.
Yeah. Oh, can I come?
Yeah. Rach, are you thinking you're gonna make it to Vail?
I thought it was $98.50.
Yeah, well it was. I, I broke a cup.
Have I been living with him for too long, or did that all just make sense?
Huh. A moo-point?
Yeah, it's like a cow's opinion. It just doesn't matter. It's moo.
Please, don't listen to Joey, okay. Would you look at him? He-he's obviously depressed. He's away from his family; he's spending Thanksgiving with strangers. What he needs right now is for you to be his friend.
You're right, I'm sorry. Thank you. Okay, that's what I'm gonna do.
Joey, just ignore the boats all right? We're not finished with the lesson yet.
That is the Coast Guard.
What are they doing out here? The coast's all the way over there.
All right.
Okay, I'm just gonna go over the basic points just one more time, are you ready?
No I wasn't! You were supposed to tell her to come and I was supposed to bring the cake!
Excuse us for a minute. You didn't tell her to come?!
You were supposed to tell her!
Fine, I'll go call her.
Yes! And please tell her to bring a cake!
No. No, not at all, not at all. I actually was gonna bring someone myself, so...
Like a date type person?
Yeah, kinda. It's this woman from work. I hope that won't be too weird. Will it, Rach?
But you said one.
I meant, me plus one!
Man in the black dress... Hi! I'm Rachel! I'm a friend of Monica and Chandler's!
Yeah! But I don't know what he looks like!
He is the man in the black dress.
I'm Amanda.
Oh I get it! A...man...duh!
Yes it is! It is true! I went, I went after Ross in stupid London.
What?! I didn't have a good time in Greece! Ross abandoned me! Okay, I couldn't get a plane out, so I had to stay in their honeymoon suite with people coming up to me all the time going, "Oh, Mrs. Geller, why are you crying?" I mean, it was sooo humiliating. I felt like such an idiot! I mean, it's all my fault! And you know why, because I make very bad decisions.
Oh that's not true.
London is stupid! Stupid!
Phoebe, you were right. I should've never gone to London, and from now on you make all of my decisions for me.
Okay, but taking care of a drunk, naked woman seems like a job for Joey.
Maybe that will liven up this party.
Okay, will you just go help her change please!
Yep.
This one's from me.
Oh wait-wait-wait!! No! Don't go in there! Don't go in there! I need another soda!
Elizabeth! Okay. Okay. I'm gonna go out this window. I'll meet you at the front door. Just tell them you're going home, okay?
Okay!
Ross!
Oh my God Ross! What in heaven's name are you doing here?
Okay. What the hell was that? You know what? Don't answer me. I have a date with Danny.
Friday's perfect...She can't wait.
On the date, I will be able to talk to her directly? See ya Friday.
How could I not get the part? The play was about a 29-year-old Italian actor from Queens.
Well, Telia Shire suddenly became available.
These are, these aren't for you. These are for you. Welcome to our country.
I am? Oh, look at that, yes I am. Enough about me, enough about me, Mr. Back from the Orient. Come on. I wanna hear everything! Everything.
Well, where do I start? This is Julie. Julie, this is Rachel.
Thank you. I'm from New York.
Ok, well, not a problem. We'll just use them to stop the bleeding. Ok. Baggage claim? Ok.
Ooh! Look! Look! Look! Look, there's Joey's picture! This is so exciting!
I'm free! I'm free!
That oughta do it.
You can always spot someone who's never seen one of his plays before. Notice, no fear, no sense of impending doom...
The exclamation point in the title scares me. Y'know, it's not just Freud, it's Freud!
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You're right, you are a tough guy. You're the toughest palaeontologist I know.
You're kidding! And he plays rugby?! That's so funny. Ohh! I see how you did that. All right.
Anyway, she thought the very idea of me playing rugby with him was like hilarious. So I'm gonna show her how tough I really am!
All right, come on look, Ross can take care of himself! It's not like he's...Chandler!
Thanks!
All right. We figured you might respond this way, so we have a backup offer.
I don't want to move again!
I don't care, this is our apartment! And they stole-you stole it-our apartment, and we won that apartment fair and square, twice! And I am getting it back right now. I'm getting back right now!
Oh no-no-no, no more offers. You can't offer anything to us!
Let us keep the apartment and...
What?! Wait! What are you talking about?! You love their Kung Pao Chicken!
Yeah. Yeah, I-I-I see the scare. Listen, Paul, I think this is really great that-that y'know, you shared your feelings. It's really, it's beautiful, but umm, what do you say we go share some food?
Oh, I couldn't eat now.
Chicken? Chicken boy!
My God, I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I didn't mean to do that! I wouldn't do that!
Honey, might I suggest watching a little more ESPN and a little less E!?
Some of them.
You mean these tuxes have been down the red carpet with people yelling, "You are you wearing?! You look fabulous!"
Okay, who wore those?
Umm, well let's see uh, this one is Tom Brokaw.
Well, Valentine's Day was like two weeks ago, so I wouldn't get her a calendar!
No.
Okay, look I need your help, I don't know what to get her for Valentine's Day.
She was working on Valentine's Day so we're celebrating it tonight.
Ohh, hey! Why don't you book a date for both of you at one of those romantic spas?
So uh, so did anything happen? Because rumor has it you guys shut the drapes!
Yeah fun? Great! So uh, so did you guys hit it off?
I guess so.
No. No. Nothing happened. I shut the drapes to uh, show her slides of my favorite fossils.
Oh, slides. So really nothing happened.
Uh, wait, so you guys are telling me you actually did the routine from eighth grade?
Uh, yeah, okay. Except I sorta felt like I needed a couple of seconds to get ready.
We were on the platform, ready to dance the world into the new Millennium, and the guy yelled 'CUT!'
Yeah. But of course we had to update it a little bit. Hey, by the way, great thinking about catching me!
'Cos I was gonna say there's no way you could've done the end the way you guys did it back then!
Ohh! And I'm one of them!! Wow! Oh, I just cannot believe this! I mean, Joey Tribbiani!
Oh Mon, listen I have to ask! Okay, Joey Tribbiani invited me back to his apartment, now does he do this with a lot of girls?
Yeah, a lot. A lot, a lot!
Well, y'know it's none of my business, but aren't you married?
Yeah. Oh I just wish we could not be married for a little bit! Y'know I just wish we could be like on a break!
Well, ultimately, I was trying y'know, I-I wanted...tell him y'know, that I'm still in love with him.
Ohh! You did not drop any socks!
I just ran into Dave and he told me that you blew him off! I mean, you listen to me! Now, I'm calling the shots! I say you leave Ross alone and go get Dave! What the hell were you trying to do?
What?!! You cannot tell him that!!
Why? Why not?! People love to hear that!
No? Y'know, I can tie one of these into a knot using just my tongue.
Care for a cherry?
Oh, no thanks.
You okay? You all right?
So we should probably get going soon.
Listen honey, can you keep dad occupied, I'm gonna go talk to mom for a while.
Dennis.
Ok, that's me.
Ok, do you have any ideas for any openers?
Uhh, let's just stay clear of 'I'm the guy that's doing you daughter' and you should be ok.
Uh-huh, I get it, smoke, chimney, chimney sweep, very funny, ha-ha.
Joey.
Hey Rach, do you smell smoke?
No-no-no, I'm serious. You don't smell it? Something's on fire.
Well no, I don't smell anything.
Hey! Hey-hey, now this was no one's fault Pheebs. Okay? It was an accident.
I know! Now look, there's only one problem though. There's only room for one, so I guess one of you will have to stay at Joey's.
Well, since the fire was kinda my fault I guess you should get to stay here.
Well no, it was my fault so you should get the nice room.
Okay!
Thanks for lunch, Chandler. Y'know, you didn't have to walk me all the way back up here.
Hey.
Hey.
Oh, that's-that's okay, no problem.
Honey um, honey, you do realise that we don't keep the women's lingerie here in the office?
Well, does a good student drink seven beers during his first lesson?
Look Joey, I'm sorry if-if you thought that was mean, but I gotta tell ya something. That was not mean. Okay, my father is mean. He used to yell at me all the time on the boat, I mean it was horrible. I was just being a good teacher.
Does a good teacher say, "Put down the beer pinhead!?"
Six and a half! You knocked that last one out of my hand! Remember?
Yeah, I didn't want you to get hit by the boom!
Yeah it is, mostly because I get to boss people around, which I just love to do.
Aahh, I'm a... chef at a restaurant uptown.
Good for you.
This hummus is great.
God bless the chickpea.
Ooooh! Honey, well we'll find you something. Do you wanna wear my black jacket?
Is this a little too... Pheebs, what happened?
Hummus. I got the hummus.
That won't go with this dress though.
No, you're right. Well, we'll find something. Let's just get you out of that. Come on.
Honey, this really is an incredible thing to do for them, but there are things to think about.
Well, they said that I had to think about it first, but what is there to think about? I'm gonna be giving them the greatest gift you can possibly give.
You're gonna be carrying their baby and give them a Sony Play Station?
Yeah, like you're gonna be pregnant. I mean pregnant.
I know!
No! No! It's just that all the people in the entire world that I want to talk to are right here.
Pheebs? Could you get that? Please?
Why? Just 'cause you're too lazy to get up off your touchie?
Okay!
Sucker!
Sorry!! I just feel bad about all that sleep you're gonna miss wishing you were with me!
Oh, oh, and hey-hey-hey, those little spelling tips will come in handy when you're at home on Saturday nights playing Scrabble with Monica!!
Hey!!
Oh, no-no-no don't you worry about me falling asleep. I still have your letter!!!
And hey! Just so you know, it's not that common! It doesn't happen to every guy! And it is a big deal!!
Well, I met Danny's sister yesterday, and uh that was actually the girl on the subway.
Uh, you weighted 200 pounds.
Still, I was quick as a cat.
Oh, you're kidding.
Yeah, they were very y'know...wrestley. But, I guess that's normal?
Yeah, we got a lot to do! We gotta think about the flowers, the caterers, the music...
Okay!
Already?!
Oh, I got some thoughts on that.
Oh wait Chandler, too many cooks...
Ok, ok, Roger was creepy, but he was nothing compared to Pete Carney.
Can you stop yellin'? You're makin' me nervous, and I can't go when I'm nervous.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, you're right. Come on, do it, do it, go, come on!!!
Which one was Pete Carney?
Pete the Weeper? Remember that guy who used to cry every time we had sex. "Was it good for you?"
Ohh... I mean two best friends falling in love, how often does that happen?
Isn't it incredible?! Monica and Chandler, gettin' married.
I know, they're gonna be so happy together.
Not that often!
No! I'm so happy for them!
Oh Chandler, I know, I know... oh, hey! You can see your nipples through this shirt!
That's so great! 'Cause you already know how to do that!
Can you believe it? I mean, don't I seem like somebody who should be doing something really cool? You know, I just always pictured myself doing something...something.
Here you go, maybe this'll cheer you up.
Ooh, you know, I had a grape about five hours ago, so I'd better split this with you.
Honey, he's about to go hit on Isabella Rosselini. I'm just sorry we don't got popcorn.
Okay.
Rach, are you really gonna let him do this?
Hi! Hi, I'm Ross, you don't know me, but I'm a big, big fan of yours. I mean, Blue Velvet, woo-oo hoo! Um, I was wondering if I could um, maybe buy you a cup of coffee? Or maybe reimburse you for that one?
Aren't you with that girl over there?
Okay no way, you cannot use that to get the cute guy and the last blueberry muffin.
All right, first name on the speed dial is mom.
Ohh, I lost my mom to suicide.
Did I use that already today? I'm sorry.
Yes okay. Well now see this isn't telling us anything. Joe. Carlos. Peter. Ooh! Peter Luger! T hat's a steak house!
She has got so much going on we-we have only two options. We have Friday...
Plus, everyone's gonna see your thing.
Well when can we have this shower?
Well that's only two days away. What is the other option?
Yesterday!
Of course he will! But Chandler the most important thing is you forgive yourself!
Oh, stop beating yourself up! People make mistakes! These things happen! There aren't any message you've forgotten to give me are there? Apparently you're not very good at it! I...
Do you think he'll ever forgive me?
Y'know what? I-I kinda have.
Already? That's pretty bad what you did.
Be-because I didn't want him to think I was stupid! I mean, that was really embarrassing what happened to you!
Okay then.
Yeah but why didn't you just say that you didn't read the book?!
Phoebe!
Yeah?
: So basically, you get your ya-yas by taking money from all of your friends.
And you know what? We want a rematch.
Well that's fine with me. Could use the money.
...Yeah.
Yes, and I get my ya-yas from Ikea. You have to put them together yourself, but they cost a little less.
Yeah, we wanted to throw you a big surprise and a great shower, and now you don't have either.
You al-you already had it?
Yeah. Well, we called everyone in your phone book and bunch of people came, but it took us so long to get you here that they-they had to leave.
We ruined everything.
Ugh...
Yes, my wind. How do you expect me to grow if you won't let me blow?
You go girl. I can't pull that off can I?
Excuse me, your, your, your wind?
You, you know I, I don't, have a- have a problem with that.
Ok, I just, I just really need to be with myself right now. I'm sorry.
No! Come on! Don't make me go long. Use me. They never cover me.
All right, no, well I want to kill them to, but their boys, y'know how are we gonna beat three boys?
All right, we still have a minute and a half to go, and we're down by two points. Two points.... Phoebe you do a button-hook again. Rachel, you go long.
Honey, there's a reason.
God, I'm not lame, okay. I can do something. I can throw, would you let me throw, come on this is my game too.
Oh my God, I can't believe this is a real $20,000 check, oh this is just so exciting.
Oh my God, Monica's gonna go out with a millionaire.
I'm not gonna go out with him.
Or incredibly offensive.
Oh yeah, sure, that too.
Yeah no, I mean it was at a flea market, so it was y'know, it was like a dollar.
Oh, okay see I thought, I thought you meant how much was it when it was new, y'know like back then.
Oh no.
A dollar?
And fifty. So it was like one and fifty dollars.
Oh, no problem. You can borrow it, by the way. Here are your keys, hon.
They took Ben to the park. Where've you been?
Just out. Had some lunch, just me, little quality time with me. Thanks for your jacket.
Okay.
Mon, if uh you were at lunch alone, how come it cost you uh 53 dollars?
Yes you do. You think of it as your apartment, and I'm just somebody who rents a room.
You still think of it as your apartment, don't you?
No.
Mmmmm.
Ok, while you "mmm" on it for awhile, I'm gonna go find a place for my new lamp.
What do you get? Emily!! Emil-Whoa!! Okay! So that's me as a cheerleader! Ta-dum!
Gimme a 'Y!'
Y!
Are you all right?
I'm fine! I'm fine! I'm just losing a tooth, it's no big deal. I have a dentist! Y'know. I'm gonna go put some ice on it. Excuse me. What do I do now? What do I do now?
No, she had to have just taken that test because I took out the trash last night.
Oh my God!
Hey, do you think this is why Chandler took off?
Oh God, this is turning into the worst wedding day ever! The bride is pregnant. The groom is missing. And I'm still holding this.
Okay Phoebe, we can not tell anyone about this.
I don't know, I, I feel like I had a dream about you last night but I, I don't remember.
Umm, I think there was a restaurant... I know there was wine. . .
Wow, well uh, uh, actually, Julie's downstairs getting a cab, I just need the cat toy, did Monica say. . . What? Why, why are you looking at me like that?
OK. Oh, oh, oh.
Did we speak on the phone last night? Did you call me?
Ok, let me take these cakes back 'cause they're gonna take that out of my paycheck.
We're good?
Yeah.
Ding dong, the psycho's gone.
Are you sure this time?
Yeah, but that just means that he was falling asleep on top of her instead of me.
Barry was the guy that I was almost married and Mindy was my best friend.
Ohh-oh, wasn't he cheating on you with her?
Why did they get divorced?
Well, apparently she caught him cheating on her with someone else. Isn't that sad? God, could you imagine if I actually married him?! I mean how different would my life be?
Chandler, you have just described virtually every man that we have ever gone out with.
You have got to get over this. You're not gonna end up alone.
Of course I am. I reject anyone who's crazy enough to actually go out with me, and then I bitch about the fact that there aren't any great women out there.
You are not a freak. You're a guy.
She's right. She's right. You are no different than the rest of them.
But you said that you liked him! I mean what happened?! Did ya just change your mind?!
Okay? Wait okay, tell-tell me that you like him, please? I mean tell me that you like him.
Look, he's a really great guy and I know that you really want this to work out, but I just don't see this having a future.
Kinda.
Then change it back!
Well, then, I guess that's the difference between us. See, I'd never make a list.
Oh, well, that's, that's mighty big of you, Ross. I said don't go!
You know what? You know what? If, things were the other way around, there's nothing you could put on a list that would ever make me not want to be with you.
I never know how long you're supposed to wait in this type of a situation before you can talk again, you know? Maybe a little longer.
Now, in some of these recipes, the quantities may seem just a little unusual, uh, like these coconut mockolate holiday nut bars. I've indicated four cups of coconut, and four cups of crushed nut, and only, uh, one tablespoon of mockolate.
No, I know, I know, and I'm sure your little boy is not going to grow up to be one.
No. I just need to be by myself for a while, you know? I just got to figure out what I want
Uh, no, no, see, because not...not all guys are going to be a Paolo.
What?
What?
So you're gonna be in the car, I will be upstairs, and that's where everybody's gonna be!
Surprise me.
Okay.
Just relax. Just relax Paul, you're doing great. She likes you. She... Maybe, she likes you. She likes you. Y'know why? Because you're a neat guy. You are the man. You are the man! I still got it. Nice and sexy. You're just a love machine. I'm just a love machine and I won't work for nobody but you! Hey bab-y! Showtime. I'm just a love machine, yeah ba-by!
Phoebe!
Look Benny, spoon. Spoon. Come on! All right, y'know what I think he's bored.
Joey, Homo Sapiens are people.
Hey-hey, I'm not judging.
Here. Ben, do you wanna play the airplane game, do you wanna show Rachel? Come here. We're gonna do something fun. Okay. Weee!! Weee!!
Who's so brave, you're so brave, yes you are, you're so brave.
Joey, if you wanna look good, why don't you just come down to the store? I'll help you out.
Yeah, like you could find something as sophisticated as this.
Done.
Great! Thanks, Rach!
Sure! God, please take those off!
Hey... hi, ladies... uh, can I get you anything? : Did you bring the mail?
Hey, guys.
Hey.
Lots of responses.
: Really? : Sure, we have scones left! : OK, read them to me.
Oh my God! What if he thinks I'm the kind of girl that-that would just sleep with him?
I accidentally kissed him in the interview, and now he wants me back y'know of course, 'cause "Let's bring the girl back who kisses everybody!"
Come on, Rach.
He probably wants you back because you're right for the job.
Maybe. I-I don't know-Oh God, how could I be so stupid?!
I am so proud of Joey, I can't believe he's going to be on Law & Order!
You wanna see flirting? I'll show you flirting.
I'm good.
I know. But don't you think that it should be called Order and Law?
No because first they arrest the guy and then they try him.
Oh, it's so easy for you I mean, you're not married, you get to have sex with who ever you want!
Yeah. Oh I just wish we could not be married for a little bit! Y'know I just wish we could be like on a break!
Well, you're not.
Yeah I can! And don't think I don't, because I do! I mean all the time, you betcha!
Monica. You've, you've done it right?
No you guys, I am not getting in a car with him, you'll have to think of something else.
No! No, I am not getting in a car with Ross, we will just have to live here!
But if...
Oh good, oh Joey and Chandler are back.
So the going for help went well?
Oh no-no, no! It's good! It's all good! I-I actually work at Ralph Lauren!
Wh--Why don't I tell you over here?
So last I heard you were gonna get married. Oh poor Ray-ray.
Shut up!
I will not! I'm the divisional head of men's sportswear!
Y'know what? I cannot do this with my left hand! Would you please, help me with this too?
Sure. I'll help you.
Oh, good! Good! Do you guys know how to get a chick out of a VCR?!
Ohh.
Okay. Let's use this brush.
You need that, you need that too 'cause obviously, a thief could just tear this up.
Oh, it's just an anti-theft device.
Then uh, what's-what's this?
Oops, sorry. Listen, we-we have to have a party tonight! Actually, we have to have one in five minutes, so everybody cancel your plans.
What are you talking about?
Ooooh, that's fine. We'll see who has the last laugh there, monkey boy.
Hmm. Kinda stepped on my point there, Mon.
So, you gals wanna hand over your money now? That way, we don't have to go through the formality of actually playing.
OK, we done with the chit-chat? Are we ready to play some serious poker?
Hey you guys, look, the one-eyed jack follows me wherever I go. Right, OK, serious poker.
Well, uh, I-I don't know. See when-when you put it that way y'know it does sort of...
No-no, they're not very nice people.
Okay, listen, I really like you. Okay? I think this can go somewhere. So what if I'm close to my family, are you gonna let that stand in the way of us?
Danny! Hurry up! The bath is getting cold!
What?
Daddy, I just... I can't marry him! I'm sorry. I just don't love him. Well, it matters to me!
Tuna or egg salad? Decide!
I'll have whatever Christine is having.
If I let go of my hair, my head will fall off.
Ooh, she should not be wearing those pants.
Okay, that's gonna take them a minute. Do you have anything else you wanna get off your chest?
What?
Right there! That's my car! Hey!!
I can't believe this!
Wait, we still have time to talk and they're-they're not even in the car yet! Oh look, there they go, okay.
Oh, yeah, I'm sorry. They used to live here; sometimes they migrate back over.
Oh I know, my God, this is so-this rice is so-I am so good.
Behind you?
Is there ah, is there some way they can not be here. It's just ah, farm birds really kinda freak me out!
Yeah, sure, okay. Okay.
Oh, yeah, well... Yeah, no use wasting this baby, just lyin' around the house.
Well, we were going to do that after-I mean umm, next.
Well, we're starving, why don't we all go get something to eat?
So... We go eat.
Yes.
Well, actually Gunther sent me. You're not allowed to have cups out here, it's a thing.
Well relax, he'll be here.
No, I know, I'm just nervous. Y'know it's just y'know Mom's dead, don't talk to my sister, Grandma's been sleeping a lot lately. It's like the last desperate chance to have a family, y'know, kinda thing. You're so sweet to wait with me.
Does anyone else think David Copperfield is cute?
No, but he told me, he thinks your a fox.
No-no-no! No-no-no! Please Ross, I can't! I can't do it! It's just gonna freak me out!!!
Thank you. I...yeah.
I mean after tomorrow night.
Okay! Okay! Ooh-hey-hey-hey! Okay! Okay! Okay! I'll-I'll tell her tonight I can't see her anymore.
Ross thanks.
Late thirties? Oh come on you guys! Is it just me? Am I overreacting to this?
Y'know, I'm still 29 in Guam.
Hey, 30 is not that old! Do you know how old the Earth is?
No Rach, it's not just you. My thirtieth birthday certainly wasn't that much fun.
And now Chandler! We're all gettin' so old! Why are you doing this to us?!
I love him. He's so pretty I wanna cry! I don't know what to do. Tell me what to do.
No, I-I just don't know how you decide who to hire. I mean I've got it narrowed down to two people. One of them has great references and a lot of experience and then there's this guy...
What about him?
Come on you know what to do! You hire the first one! You don't hire an assistant because they're cute, you hire them because they're qualified.
Uh-huh. No, I hear what you're saying and-and-and that makes a lot of sense but can I just say one more thing? Look how pretty!
Ooh! Y'know what? If we made reservations, we could have unagi in about a half-hour.
All I'm saying is, it's one thing being prepared for an attack against like each other; whole another story being prepared for an attack, I don't know, like a surprise!!
All right, you know that one was coming, but that doesn't mean you have unagi.
Y'know what...
Hey-hey, is Monica here?
Look-look-look-look-look, my first pay check! Look at the window, there's my name! Hi, me!
Alright, alright, maybe it'll take my mind off it. Do you promise to buy me a big thumb finger?
You got it.
I remember the day I got my first pay check. There was a cave in in one of the mines, and eight people were killed.
Wow, you worked in a mine?
All right Paul, I'm not asking for a lot here. Okay? Just give me something. Anything!
Well, you're lucky you never met that bitch Sharon Majesky. Anyway, umm... The rest of you life, y'know? Any regrets?
Nope.
Okay.
Okay.
Uh well, y'know what? I don't think if I feel comfortable stealing on my very first day...
Luck!
Hey Rach, now that you're working at Ralph Lauren, can you bring me back some of those polo shirts?
Unwilling to steal from work, interesting.
Besides, if anybody's gonna get free stuff, it's gonna be me.
Uh, I'm just, I'm just looking out your window. At-at the view. What are you guys doing?
Oh yes, it's me! Sorry!
What are you doing here?
We got some Vap-O-Rub in some places.
Oh, he brought her back to his apartment.
I know. I know. Oh God. There's no tissue! Can you grab me some toilet paper?
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's just...It's just so sad!
Yeah, but you've got to pull yourself together! Monica can't see you like this! Then she'll know something's wrong!
Yeah. Oh, that's gone too. This is Monica's bathroom right?!
Oh!
What? Monica, they are cute, they are doctors, cute doctors, doctors who are cute!
Not stupid. The very cute, cute, cute doctors asked us out for tomorrow night, and I said "yes."
I think it's totally insane, I mean, they work for the hospital. It's like returning to the scene of the crime. You know, I say we blow off the dates.
Alright, what have we learned so far?
SURPRISE!!!
No. I just need to be by myself for a while, you know? I just got to figure out what I want
Yep!
See, Rach, uh, see, I don't think that swearing off guys altogether is the answer. I really don't. I think that what you need is to develop a more sophisticated screening process.
Uh, no, no, see, because not...not all guys are going to be a Paolo.
No, I know, I know, and I'm sure your little boy is not going to grow up to be one.
Oh, you're not gonna tell the whole story about how your parents got divorced again are you?
I'm sorry. It's just that this is the worse Thanksgiving ever.
No-no-no! I am the king of bad Thanksgivings. You can't just swoop in here with your bad marriage and take that away from me.
Oh God, no.
Oh, come on! I wanna hear it! It wouldn't be Thanksgiving without Chandler bumming us out!
Oh yeah. Well, at least I wasn't too chicken to tell some guy I thought he was cute.
You give me back my sweater or it's handbag marinara.
You don't have the guts.
Oh alright, stop, STOP THE MADNESS. This is crazy. Who can even remember why this even started in the first place?
Yes that's right. But still, I-, look at your purse, look at your sweater, look at yourselves.
Okay. Uh, well can we, can we get you anything Mr. Zelner? Maybe some chocolates?
Yeah, sure Mr. Zelner, for you anything-minute. Okay. Fine. Abort the plan, abort the plan.
Uh actually, I'd like to speak with both of you.
Umm, no. Thanks, but I'll give these to Betty. So I read your evaluation of Tag, or to use his full name, Tag Sweetcheeks Jones. Is something going on with you two?
Oh my God. Can you imagine if there was?! I mean, what would happen exactly.
Ross is on a date with my sister and they shut the drapes two and a-half-hours ago.
Ho-oh, he's gonna get some! Of the glare from the streetlight out of his apartment. Y'know so umm, he's closed the drapes there so he can have a nice, pleasant conversation with your little sister. Well, I'm off to bed!
Oh, uh, hey Rach. I uh, I was just coming over here to uh... Oh wait, I don't have to lie to you, you don't live here anymore. Uh, I'm eating their food. What are you doing?
Whoa, I didn't know we could date your sister!
Joey we know you steal our food.
Marcel, this is for you. It's, uh, just, y'know, something to, um, do on the plane.
Marcel, I'm hungry.
That was good.
Uh, if you guys don't mind, I'd like to take a moment, just me and him.
Oh, sure. Sure, absolutely.
Airport, airport. Ross, not alone, Julie, arm around her. Cramp, cramp.
Yes, yes, we did, thanks to Vidal Buffay.
'Cause, you know, if you don't look good, we don't look good. I love that voice.
Ok, I think she's trying to tell us something. Quick, get the verbs.
You, you, you said he liked me. You, you slowpokes!
: Really? : Sure, we have scones left! : OK, read them to me.
Hey... hi, ladies... uh, can I get you anything? : Did you bring the mail?
Lots of responses.
: Dear Ms. Green, thank you for your inquiry, however... oh...
: We have apple cinnamon...
Oh! Did you hear that?! My dad's proud of me! My dad's proud of me.
Wow! What did he say?
That he wouldn't pay for my lawyer! Then he told me to come here and learn about the value of money from the one daughter he's actually proud off.
Rach?
Oh yeah, sorry. Wait honey, so what did you do that made dad cut you off?
Well, last time I almost got fired. You must end it, you must end it now!
I don't understand! Last time you went out with her you said she was a 'big, dull dud.'
Well, I think I judged her too quickly, and this time we were able to take the relationship to the next level.
Oh, come on! It's not like this is an everyday occurrence for me! I mean usually I'm pretty much just in there by myself.
Chandler!! Promise me, you will end it.
Yeah, sure. Umm, they didn't have poppy seed bagels, so I... Oh my word!
It's me! Good morning!
Rachel, could you come in here for a moment, please?
I seem to have had a slight office mishap. Could you please get the key off the back of the door for me.
Oh, yeah! Yeah!
Come on Ross! You said you wanted to talk about it, let's talk about it!! How was she?
Was she good?
Don't answer that.
She was...
Awful! Horrible!
Ugh, Ross! That was not a near death experience! That was barely an experience!
Okay, no, that's not the right decision. That's not, that's not right, no Ross-Ross, come on! I mean, that woman made you miserable! Okay, Ross, do you really want to get back into that?
Okay, look, yesterday I would've even considered calling her back, but my ex-wife calls on the same day I have a near death experience. I mean, that-that has got to mean something!
You weren't there! Okay, maybe this is something that I-I'm supposed to seize! Y'know?
Okay, y'know what? Maybe, this is not about seizing stuff. Maybe this is about escaping stuff.
Ross, tonight was about the two of you getting along. Oh, would you just see my chiropractor, already.
You had to do it, didn't you? You couldn't just leave it alone.
Four percent. Okay. I tip more than that when there's a bug in my food.
Yeah, I'm gonna go to a doctor who went to school in a mini-mall.
Hey Pheebs, what are you doing?
Okay, y'know what? Maybe, this is not about seizing stuff. Maybe this is about escaping stuff.
Ugh, Ross! That was not a near death experience! That was barely an experience!
You weren't there! Okay, maybe this is something that I-I'm supposed to seize! Y'know?
Huh.
I mean, look-look today you escaped death, y'know? And maybe this is a chance for you to escape getting back together with Emily?
No, you know what, it's late, everything's gonna be closed. Why don't we just do it another night?
Yeah well, you know what, so is uh, Sorentino's.
Wha, OK, I'm sorry, let's uh, why don't we find someplace else.
No, no, we won't.
We won't?
Honey, come on! You live far away! You're not related. You lift right out.
Well, of course I am! It's not gonna happen to Ross! He's your brother. He's your old college roommate. Ugh, it was just a matter of time before someone had to leave the group. I just always assumed Phoebe would be the one to go.
Ehh!!
Hey!
Hey, Mr. Bing. That uh, hotel you stayed at called. Said someone left an eyelash curler in your room.
I did it! Oh! I finished it! I did it all by myself! And there's nobody to hug!
Oh my god! I'm so sorry, Cheryl. I must have freaked out.
Oh, thank god, it's not Mitzi. It's just a rat.
Move!
Hey! Hey, you guys, I finished the crossword all by myself! Hug me!
No, but they stuck me in personal shopping. Which is just a huge step down!
Bloomingdale's eliminated my department.
Oh my God, are you out of a job?
Personal shopping? What is that? Like where you walk around with snooty rich people and tell them what to buy?
Uh-huh.
Hello? Yeah, this is she. Oh! You're kidding! You're kidding! Oh thank you! I love you!
You saved them! You guys! Oh God, you're the best!
It's like 'Night of the Living Dead Christmas Trees.'
Sure, everybody loves a kidder.
I got the job!
Yeah, I mean, come on Ross, no one will even notice. I mean they're probably not even listening!
Well...
Why don't you phase it out? Yeah, fade the accent out and people will think you're, y'know, that you're adjusting to life in America.
They're not listening too me?
Of course they're listening to you! Everybody listens to you.
Because it's Richard's son! It's like inviting Greek tragedy over for dinner!
I know, it's sick.
Why is it sick?
Hey, come on, Phoebe, you understand don't you?
Yeah, I can see where I'd be your best shot but, no. I'm sorry, but I think it's twisted.
Ok, everybody, let's give a uh nice warm Central Perk welcome to--
Come on, pick up, pick up! Hello? Transit Authority? Yes, hello. I'm doing research for a book, and I was wondering what someone might do if they left a baby on a city bus. Yes I do realize that would be a very stupid charact er.
Hi, here's the deal. We lost a carseat on a bus today. It's white plastic, with a handle, and it fits onto a stroller. Oh, and there was a baby in it. He wants to talk to you again.
Terry's a jerk, and he won't let me work, and I hate Central Perk!
Uh, to Stephanie Schiffer.
What are you talking about?! Mindy, the guy is the devil! He's Satan in a smock!
Okay. Okay, we'll be here! Hating you! Did you see how he was sweating when he walked out of there? Listen honey, if I'm hogging the ball too much you just jump right in there and take a couple punches because I'm telling you, this feels great.
Yeah... I'm pretty sure I'm still gonna marry him.
Look, I know he's not perfect, but the truth is, at the end of the day, I still really wanna be Mrs. Dr. Barry Farber, D.D.S.
Oh God.
Yeah that's great. But first, wait, talk to me, talk to me. Tell me about your day.
Oh, if that's what you want you then you really should run his head under hot water and bang his head against a table.
Honey I made a reservation at China Garden, is that okay?
It was fine.
Okay. Hey, what are you thinking? What are you thinking right now?
Well, I assume I'll have to take showers with him, but y'know, that's true of any job.
That's excellent.
So, he's just a nice guy. You really think this Mark doesn't want anything in exchange for helping him?
How ya feelin'?
Well, my apartment isn't there anymore, because I drank it.
Why? Is he? He is! Isn't he? He's dating that slut in marketing!
I am not gonna get fired, because I'm not gonna act on it.
So you wouldn't mind if he was dating someone else?
Maybe I should open a divorced men's club.
Dude that is so sad.
Yeah, so what is she, like a... like a spokesmodel, or an aerobics instructor, what?
Probably the only time I'll ever say this, but did you see the ass on her?
Where did you, when did you, how did you... How did you get a girl like that?
Actually she's a paleontology doctoral candidate, specializing in the centazoic era.
Okay, but that's, like, the easiest era.
Oh my God, Phoebe, Pottery Barn has ripped off the design of our antique!
Ross, where did you get this?!
I got it at Pottery Barn!! Okay?!
Wow! Oh my God, well if they've ripped off our table ours must be much more than one and fifty dollars!
Oh yes.
I know you did. I'm just gonna deal with it, I'm just gonna deal with it. I gotta get out of here.
Ok, ok, ok. How did this happen to me? How did this happen to me? A week ago, two weeks ago, I was fine. Ross was just Ross, just this guy. Now he's Rrrooossss, oh, this really great guy that I can't have.
Sweetie, I wanted you to have him too.
Ok, I don't care what you guys say, something's bothering her.
You know, I think I was sixteen.
For Stella! Remember? She's gettin' her grove back in like 20 minutes.
Hi! Are you ready? We're gonna be late!
For what?
Yeah, I uh, totally forgot about that. You mind if I take a rain check? I'm waiting for a call from Emily.
Sure. I guess. Hey, I hear you don't have to go to London. Yay!
I loved the moment when you first saw the giant dog shadow all over the park.
So don't do it, it's fine. You don't have to do it just because Susan does it.
Hello, baby. Hello, hello.
Yeah, but did they have to shoot him down? I mean, that was just mean.
Ok, right about now the turkey should be crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside. Why are we standing here?
Chandler, this is not addressed to you. This is addressed to Mrs. Braverman downstairs. Thief.
Oh, y'know I'm not that much of a sweet tooth. I--Wow. My God, so creamy. Oh my God, this is the best cheesecake I have ever had. Where did you get this?
It was at the front door. When I got home. Somebody sent it to us.
I-no! I didn't read the box before I opened it. And you can't return a box after you've opened the box.
Why, why not?
Oh, y'know what you should get 'em? One of those little uh, portable CD players.
That's okay Pheebs, we're not having a party or anything, so you don't have to get us...
If someone wants to give us a present, we don't want to deprive them of that joy.
Oh, I already have one.
Not unless someone borrowed it and left it at the gynecologist.
Is my hook unhooked? These things keep falling down, I can't. . .
Oh, thanks. So, uh, what are you gonna do this summer?
Oh, you know, I'm just gonna, I'm gonna hang out, work on my music.
Uh, hold, let me see, I don't know. So what're you gonna do. . .
Oh, the guys are here.
Hi Russ, I've just got two more tables to clean and then we'll go, OK?
Hi.
Hey Ross.... bahhhh!
OK, I'll just sit here and... uh... chat with your, uh.... friend-type....people.
Rachel? Um, hi.
Yeah, but umm... Yes, but, Fonzie was already cool, so he wasn't hurt, right?
Undo it. Undo it. Undo it.
Fonzie met Mork. Mork froze Fonzie.
Yeah, that's right.
Hey!
Well, someone that has his own tux, or has the ability to rent a tux.
Yeah! It's weird. But the thing is need to find a date.
Well, what kind of guy are you looking for?
So he has to be a male who has at least $50.
Ooh! So close.
Oh no! No! It's actually-it's very sweet. It's very sweet. Look! Yeah, do you want it?
It's not a baby! It's a cat!
Eew! It's creepy looking!
No, I hate cats.
Well, so then what are you doing to me? Okay? Just get out of here! All right? Move on!
Nooo! Nooooo! You lent me Monica's earrings?! I'm not allowed to borrow her stuff!
Tell her to wear her own earrings.
These are her earrings.
Why not?
Because I lose her stuff!
I got the tickets! I got the tickets! Five hours from now, shoop, shoop, shoop.
All right, that's it. You know what? Just get out of my way and stop moping.
That's closer.
Oh, you must stop shooping.
Ok, I'm gonna get my stuff.
Or maybe you would see me looking embarrassed because you are talking on the phone with your crotch!
Y'know what Tag, if we went down to the office you would see those contracts sitting on your desk.
No, I would see you looking embarrassed because they are not on my desk!
You wanna go down to the office right now?
No! Come on its late, we're not gonna go down to the office.
Yeah, we found them. There were in the guest room closet behind some coats.
Really, y'think so? I don't..
I couldn't find anything at Joey--Hey-hey, oh hey!
Yeah, and you have nothing to worry about 'cos they're all crap!
Those are my gifts, I got them for you.
Okay, Pheebs, can I ask? So, hes going out with her. I mean, is it really so terrible?
Are you alright?
Yeah. Its just, you know, its this whole stupid Ursula thing, its...
Um, yeah. Look, I mean, Im not saying shes like evil or anything. She just, you know, shes always breaking my stuff. When I was eight, and I wouldnt let her have my Judy Jetson thermos, so she threw it under the bus. And then, oh, and then there was Randy Brown, who was like... Have you ever had a boyfriend who was like your best friend?
No.
Hit me. Hit me. Hit me. Hit me. Hit me. Hit me. Hit me.
Also Monday.
What time? Maybe we can share a cab!
We need more cards.
Yeah, and also we need more umm, drinks. Hold on a second. Whup, okay. Hello! Vegas? Yeah, we would like some more alcohol, and y'know what else? We would like some more beers. Hello? Ohh, I forgot to dial!
Well, how can you be a tour guide, don't you have to be a dinosaur expert or something?
So what job did you get Joe?
Oh, ah, tour guide at the museum. Yeah, Ross got it for me.
No, not really. They give you all the information, it's uh, it's like memorizing a script. "And on your left, you have Tyrannosaurus Rex, a carnivore from the Jurassic period.
Great!! That's great!
Of course I clean it. I mean, I,I will cleeeean it. I mean, I will cleeeean it.
Come on, Terry, I'll even clean the cappuccino machine.
You don't clean the cappuccino machine?
Oh, all right, fine, fine, fine.
Done.
Hey! Hey! Hi! Hey-hey-hey, I'm Rachel! From upstairs? The ones with all the pizza?
Yeah?
What else do they add smell too?
Oh, is there a problem?
No. No. Every thing's--they're fine. Great pizza. But it's uh, actually umm my friend Ross. He uh, just gets really nervous when he's flirting.
Here, kitty-kitty. Here kitty-kitty. Where did you go, little kitty-kitty-kitty? Here kitty-kitty-kitty-kitty...
Oooh! You are a very bad man!
You owe me a cat.

Wow.
All right. Let's say I had slept with Mark. Would you have been able to forgive me?
Hi, it's Phoebe. Listen someone's gonna have to take my 9:00 with Mr. Rehack, 'cause it's like 9:15 now, and I'm not there.
Don't you realise none of this would've ever happened if I didn't think at that same moment you weren't having sex with Mark?
Yes I would.
You'd be okay if you knew that Mark had kissed me, and been naked with me, and made love to me?
Well, actually, I meant for me. The hiring committee is meeting people all day and...
Oh, uh, Joanna I was wondering if I could ask you something. There's an opening for an assistant buyer in Junior Miss...
Okay, but that would actually be a big step down for me.
Oh. Well, I wish I could say no, but you can't stay my assistant forever. Neither can you Sophie, but for different reasons.
God, I am so glad you don't have a problem with this, because if you did, I wouldn't even consider applying.
Well, so then what are you doing to me? Okay? Just get out of here! All right? Move on!
Oh no! No! It's actually-it's very sweet. It's very sweet. Look! Yeah, do you want it?
No, I hate cats.
Wow! What an unusual cat!
Yes! Thank you! Exactly! You want it?
You guys, there's a little girl in Soho looking for this cat. I mean, you know what that means?!
You guys, you're never gonna believe what I just found tacked up on a telephone pole! Look kinda familiar?
Apparently Phoebe's mother also goes by the name Julio.
Yeah-eah! 200 dollar reward, split five ways!!
Do we have to tell her?
Everything's ruined. My bed. My clothes. Look at my favorite blue sweater.
Oh, it's bad. It's really bad. The only thing in there that isn't burned is an ass. Which I do not remember buying!
How's your room Rach?
Isn't that mine?
Fine! I'm sorry for your loss!
Oh God, ohh, okay, y'know what, do you think ah, do you think that you just forget that I told you this?
I'm sorry, that's not funny.
Actually, it kinda is. My wife won't return my calls. I don't know where my wife is. "Hey Ross, where's the Mrs.?" Don't know!
Well, I kinda half to. I mean, because the thing is...
The thing is y'know, that you're married to Emily.
Oh not-not so much. Umm, what-what do you, what do you mean is there something wrong with Ross?
Yeah.
He's the kind of guy you're friends with, y'know? But he's not the kind of guy you date. He's the kind of guy you'd date because you did. Me, not so much.
Oh no-no-no, he's just I don't know, he's just a little bookish.
Are-are you saying he's a geek?
Ok, so Phoebe, now are you gonna call your dad and let him know that his dog is ok?
Oh, thank God.
Yeah, but he did have to have a bunch of stitches and he said that only once in a blue moon does a dog's ear grow back so...still hoping.
I, I don't wanna meet my father over the phone. What am I gonna say, like 'Hi, I'm Phoebe, the daughter you abandoned. Oh, by the way, I broke your dog.'
Hey Phoebs, if you want, I'll do it.
Thank you. Now are you sure? Because once I make a copy, there's no turning back.
Hey, can I borrow the key to your house so I can run across the street and make a copy?
Sure! Here.
Yeah, I'm-I'm sure. Yeah, get out of here before I change my mind.
Umm, listen, Ross do you really think this moving in with Rachel is a good idea?
Oh so you know that, you guys talked about that, so you get along, so you think you're gonna go out?
That is great. Hey, y'know who doesn't have to job hunt? Ross. He works at the university.
Yeah.
Me go out with Ross?! No! God no! What would make you think that?
I just, Phoebe, said y'know thought she saw something between you guys.
Monica! I couldn't find him for two hours! He was having sex with Amy Welch!
Nooo! It's not okay! I can't believe you would want to after what he did to me!
What, that little thing at the prom?
Come on, that was back in high school! How could that still bother you?
I mean why, of all people would you want to go out with Chip?!
Well, maybe that's my decision. Well, maybe I don't need your money. Wait!! Wait, I said maybe!!
Look Daddy, it's my life. Well maybe I'll just stay here with Monica.
Well, I guess we've established who's staying here with Monica...
Just breathe, breathe.. that's it. Just try to think of nice calm things...
Raindrops on roses and rabbits and kittens, bluebells and sleighbells and- something with mittens... La la la la...something and noodles with string. These are a few...
What, so you go over there, you tell him you think he's cute, what's the worst that could happen?
Wow, so why don't you go talk to him?
Oh, yeah.
He could hear me.
OK, I'm doin' it for ya.
Ok, Paulo, why don't you just go get dressed, and then you be on your way, ok, bye-bye.
Bon giorno tutti!
Ewww!
Rachel, how did this happen?
I don't know, I just kinda ran into him last night.
Ross said my name up there, I mean, come on, I just can't pretend that didn't happen can I?
Mon, honey, I gotta ask you something.
Now?
Oh, I-I don't know.
Monica, what should I do?
Actually, what I think you said was, "don't touch that, and get the hell out of my kitchen."
No, that was his costume. See, he's actually an orthodontist, but he came as a regular dentist.
Um, you guys, you know when I said before, "thank you, but I don't really need your help"?
Really? Weird. Anyway, see, I planned everything really well. I planned and I planned and I planned. It just turns out, I don't think I planned enough time to actually do it.
Hey, Mon, you want some help?
Ohh, I'm gonna have to get over it. God, see I didn't know that's I had to do, I just have to get over it.
Ooh, Julie's so smart, Julie's so special.
Look honey, I wanted you to hook up with Ross as much as you did. But he's with her now and you're just gonna have to get over it.
Woah.
Foxy lady.
Well, he doesn't really love her. I mean, it's just a rebound thing from me.... You'll see!
Well I-I think your wrong.
Oh-no.
Fortunately, I won't. And by the way, it seems to be perfectly clear that you were on a break.
Do something..... Something....
So you know, I...I handed in that marketing report and I never got to hear what you thought.
Oh, Kim, Hi.
Uhh-huh.
I didn't read it.
Ahh....So...Wow...The spring line, it's really going to be great this year, huh?
I did!! I watched! I watched! I watched Monica bang his head against that thing!
I did!
I know! I'm saying you have to watch them all the time.
Monica did it?
Monica?
Yeah, but she also invited you and Ross. Yeah, honey, I'm sorry, but I don't think that was a romantic thing.
I don't think so.
What are you talking about? She just invited him to the biggest party of the millennium!
Oh. Maybe. But hey I know how I can find out. We're going to a New Year's Eve party, right? So at midnight, I can kiss her. And if she kisses me back, great! Y'know? But if she says 'Dude, what the hell are you doing?' I can say 'It wasn't me, it was New Years!'
Well, that's a lot better than Ross trying to kiss me in High School, and saying that he did it because he needed chapstick.
There, well, see? Barry wouldn't even kiss me on a miniature golf course.
I just never had a relationship with that kind of passion, you know, where you have to have somebody right there, in the middle of a theme park.
Well, it was the only thing to do there that didn't have a line.
Come on.
No, he said we were holding up the people behind us.
Oh, my, God, c'mon, you guys! He's gonna be home any minute! He's gonna kill me!
Alright alright. You're a monkey. You're loose in the city. Where do you go?
Okay, it's his first time out, so he's probably gonna wanna do some of the touristy things. I'll go to Cats, you go to the Russian Tea Room.
Okay, we'll start with the building. You guys take the first and second floor, Phoebe and I'll take third and fourth.
Well, what'm I gonna do? What'm I gonna do?
Honey um, honey, you do realise that we don't keep the women's lingerie here in the office?
Thanks for lunch, Chandler. Y'know, you didn't have to walk me all the way back up here.
Oh, that's-that's okay, no problem.
Yes, I realise that.
Summer catalogue!
Hi! Sorry- sorry we're late, we, uh, kinda just, y'know, lost track of time.
There y'go. Ross?
Uh, I'm not really a shot drinking kinda guy.
...But a man can change.
Anyone want me to appraise anything?
Oh, come on! Saran Wrap on the toilet seat, you don't think that's just a little funny?!
Oh that.
Yeah that! You know I hate practical jokes! They're mean and they're stupid and-and I don't want my son learning them!
I was barefoot. Now tell me, the toilet thing is the only thing you taught him right?
Yes.
Ooh, Phoebe's here! Okay, let's turn out all the lights and we'll just watch the movie!
Hey!
Hey!
Okay. Hey-Ooh, cool sheets!
Oh, you like it? You wanna know where I got it?
Oh, The Velveteen Rabbit! Oh my God, when the boy's love makes the rabbit real!
'Kay.
Actually, this is for Kathy's birthday. It's an early edition of her favorite book.
Okay, but don't touch it, because you fingers have destructive oils.
Huh. Well, then you'd better keep it away from Ross's hair. So this is pretty rare. How did you get that?
Oh hi! Y'know, I just wanted to see if there were any leads on the old job front.
Yeah, not it here it isn't.
Sorry I'm late, what's up?
Oh no! But I just walked past three sales and I didn't go in. How strong am I?
That is great. Hey, y'know who doesn't have to job hunt? Ross. He works at the university.
Well, I-I know you can do that too. I'm just, I'm just saying if you need somebody to talk to... Hi!
Well, why don't you talk to me about it, maybe I can help.
No. No. You-you can't help. I mean, I kinda have to do this without your help.
Thanks.
Ross? Look, whatever this relationship stuff that Emily wants, just give it to her. Come on, the bottom line here is that you love her. So just fix whatever she wants fixed. Just do it. I mean, you're gonna have to try. You'll just gonna hate yourself if you don't. Oh come on answer it! It's driving me crazy!
Ugh!!! Well, the apartment is already subletted! I mean, this is just hopeless. I'm never gonna find anything.
I can't believe you won't just admit it! Okay, just promise me that you won't do anything stupid.
Look, we're just friends now! Okay? Why would I do anything stupid?
You can live with me.
What?!
Maybe it's not as bad as I think. Y'know, maybe they didn't take it the way I meant it.
See, this is why I told you never get involved with your assistant! And here is no such thing as keeping secrets when it comes to affairs. Did you hear that Chandler? No such thing!
What happened? I'm just eating candy.
Absolutely! Y'know, because touchie can mean both ass and good worker.
Ugh, I just gotta get the thing back!
Oh it does, it does! It is a room separating apparatus from Colonial times.
Fascinating.
Another amazing find! Wow! Oh I bet this has a great story too!
Ah!
Hmm, a lot of this stuff is from Colonial times. Hey, what are some other time periods Rachel?
I just can't believe this! I mean, with the holidays coming up- I wanted him to meet my family-
I'm sorry..
Oh, she's sorry! I feel better!
I'll meet somone else. There'll be other Alans.
Oh, yeah! Right!
You want me to just call him up and tell him that you're seeing him instead? That's what you want?
Oh, what do you, you want me to stop seeing him, is that what you want?
Uh-huh.
OK.
Oh that's what you want.
Come on, I don't really want to be doing this right now. I am carrying a very heavy couch.
Really? You two?
Yeah! Rach?
Then tell him quickly.
Fine! We went out.
Well, I never thought I'd say this, but I'm gonna go use Ugly Naked Guy's bathroom.
It's amazing! You better hurry up and fill out an application or I'm gonna beat you to it.
Ohh.
Oh, look! There's Monica and Chandler! Hey! Hey, you guys! Hey! Ohh!! Ohh! Ahh-ahhh!!
What?!
I'm not paying for half of that! I'm only staying here until my apartment gets fixed.
Huh, yeah I guess we are roommates now.
Yeah! Well, now that you brought it up, our fridge is broken. We have to get a new one. Now, I checked around and your half is $400. Thanks a lot.
Look Rach, my parents bought this fridge just after I was born, okay? Now, I have never had a problem with it. Then you show up and it breaks! What does that tell ya'?
That refrigerators don't live as long as people.
Ok, Pheebs, you know what, if we had that, we wouldn't be doing the ritual in the first place.
All I have is, is oregano and a Fresca.
Um, that's ok! Ok. All right. Now we need the semen of a righteous man.
Can we just start throwing things in?
Ok, yeah, ok. Oh, OK.
I'm serious, I really, I think I need just to have some...meaningless, sex y'know, with the next guy that I see.
Rachel stop!
You're so bad!
Excuse, I seem to have dropped my ball.
Yeah, so?
Well, not myself, but I know other people that have. Ok, you caught me. I'm a laundry virgin.
Oh god. Oh, am I being like a total laundry spaz? I mean, am I supposed to use like one machine for shirts and another machine for pants?
Rach, have you never done this before?
Uh, well, don't worry, I'll use the gentle cycle. Ok, um, basically you wanna use one machine for all your whites, a whole nother machine for colors, and a third for your uh, your uh, delicates, and that would be your bras and your under-panty things.
Ok, Well, what about these are white cotton panties. Would they go with whites or delicates?
Nooo Way! The most romantic song ever is The Way We Were.
Huh.
I have to say Tupolo Honey by Van Morrison.
See, I-I think that one that Elton John wrote for, um, that guy on Who's The Boss.
What song was that, Pheebs?
Oh God, come on you guys, is this really necessary? I mean, I can stop charging anytime I want.
And who pays for that?
Um... my... father.
C'mon, you can't live off your parents your whole life.
I know that. That's why I was getting married.
Whoa! Y'know what Katie? I gotta tell ya I-I-I-I think you are the one who is too much.
Oh! Ow!
Oh, ow! Did Joey tell you to say that? You guys, are too much!
Ohh, Joey has the nicest friends!
Ohh, and the nicest girlfriend!
No, no, that's not what we ordered... We ordered a fat-free crust with extra cheese.
I don't even have a 'pl'.
Hi, one, uh, mushroom, green pepper and onion?
Wait, you're not 'G.Stephanopoulos?' Man, my dad's gonna kill me!
Wait! Did you say 'G.Stephanopoulos?'
You have not worn that T-shirt since you were 15!! It doesn't even fit you anymore!
Huh?
I'm-I'm gonna wear this all the time! I love this shirt!!
Oh, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah...
yeah-yeah-yeah!!
No. Yeah, and I know that. All right, well thank you so much for coming in it was nice to meet you.
I've never interviewed anyone before. I've actually never had anyone work for me before. Although when I was a kid, we did have a maid, but this is-this isn't the same thing.
No dear. It's not.
Thank you! Good meeting you.
All right. I'm a total pro!
So Joey I just hooked Ross and Chandler up with some tuxedos for the wedding, do you need one?
Hey!
Hey!
No, I'm performing the ceremony. I'm not wearing a tux.
Well, what are you going to wear?
All right, all right, all right. Last night, I had a dream that, uh, you and I, were...
Look at you, you won't even look at him.
Oh, come on tell me. I could use another reason why women won't look at me.
Doing it on this table.
Wow!
Julie! Julie, isn't that great? I mean, isn't that just kick- you-in-the-crotch, spit-on-your-neck fantastic?
Well, Ross and I were in grad school together.
But we haven't seen each other since then. Well I land in China, guess who's in charge of the dig.
Oh, that is so sweet. No, no, ok, you hang up. Ok, ok, one, two, three. Well you didn't hang up either.
She didn't hang up either...
Are you kidding? I'm trained for nothing! I was laughed out of twelve interviews today.
Guess what?
You got a job?
And yet you're surprisingly upbeat.
You would be too if you found John and David boots on sale, fifty percent off!
I can't let him go out that way, he's got a meeting. You've got something here on your back.
Ohh, okay. Wh-Ah-ha! Wait a minute. Uh Ben, I can't do it.
What?
What? That's great. That is great. What did we just finish talking about Ben?!
Oh I...
I just saw Danny getting on the subway with a girl and he had his arm around her.
Oh.
Hey, what's up?
Oh, honey, I'm sorry.
Well, you should be, this is all your fault! You meddled in our relationship!!
Right. Was it the, "Please don't show me another picture of a trilobite vibe?"
Oh, slides. So really nothing happened.
Something could've happened. All right? She-she really dug my slides. And-and she was definitely giving me the vibe.
Anyway, if she, if she wasn't in to me, why-why would she ask me out again?
She asked-asked you out again?
Honey, honey, I'm sorry, I know it's our anniversary but I told you on the phone I don't have time to stop.
Ross honey, this is very nice, but, but I-I got a crisis.
Yeah, but I got cous-cous!
Okay, you don't have to stop, I'm invisible, I'm not here.
But I don't, hmm... Oh, who approved that order?! Well there is no Mark Robbinson in this office. Get me Mark on the phone!
Okay, now what was that all about? Is it-does it not taste good? Let me try it.
I'll help you dial.
I'm gonna go into the bathroom so I can look at it in the mirror, as I eat it.
Wha? No no! Ah! All gone! So good! Maybe Chandler has some left.
It tastes like feet!
Ok, while you "mmm" on it for awhile, I'm gonna go find a place for my new lamp.
Yes you do. You think of it as your apartment, and I'm just somebody who rents a room.
Mmmmm.
Ok, Pheebs. See how I'm making these little toys move? Opposable thumbs. Without evolution, how do you explain opposable thumbs?
Maybe the overlords needed them to steer their spacecrafts.
No honey, okay, okay, you wanna know why Ross canceled the date? Because I asked him to.
It's not random, it's Bob.
It's probably because not mature enough. Or smart enough. Maybe he doesn't like the way I dress-No that can't be it. It's really gotta be the smart thing. Oh I'm so stupid! I'm just like this incredibly pretty stupid girl!
You asked him too?!
Hm-mmm.
Thanks! I've been here about six years, and Rachel moved in a few months ago.
Hello! Here we go!
This is a great place. How long have you lived here?
Yeah... ..see, I was supposed to get married, but, um, I left the guy at the altar.
Really?
Okay! No accountants. Oh, and no one from like legal. I don't like guys with boring jobs.
Yeah! Wait a minute, it's been a long time that I've been single. How come you never offered this before?
Well, I have a girlfriend, I'm-I'm happy. So, I no longer feel the need to go out of my way to stop others from being happy.
Oh and Ross was like what? A lion tamer?
Hey!
Can you not look at me when I say this? I thought that if I could get you here, I could seduce you.
Ughhhh!! Forget it! This is, this is not how this is supposed to happen.
Well, what was supposed to happen?
Huh. Oh, boy! Uhh, I-I don't wear suits to work, and I bought six of them from you.
Well, I'm sorry, I thought you needed them!
Okay, okay. Umm, well ah, maybe he, maybe he feels awkward because you are my boss.
Maybe he's intimated by really smart, strong, successful women.
Sophie, would you please climb out of my butt. Why hasn't he called, Rachel? Why?
Awkward? Why should he feel awkward?
Well...
Im okay! Im okay! Mr. Heckles, Mr. Heckles could you help me please?
No no no no no. You wanted me to take them down, so... ..Im takin em down. Okay? Whoa!
Oh-my-god Rachel! Rachel!
See, this is just the kind of thing I was talking about.
Ow ow ow. Ow ow ow ow. Ow ow ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow.
Okay. Well that's pretty much all that we have-Oh! Oh! Have you ever had a virgin margarita?
Uh great! How do you feel about Diet Coke?
I'm not allowed to have soda.
What's a virgin?
Water it is.
Well y'know what they say, the 23rd time's the charm. Aww, look at you all handsome!
I've had better.
All right! I found one that fits!
Whose is it?
Oh does it matter?! All that matters is that you look so handsome.
Yeah, but that was different. Y'know? I mean, we were, we were going out then, now I think it's weird.
I don't want you to see me naked!
Rachel, I've seen you naked a million times. I ate hot fudge off you naked. Remember, I-I sucked that mini-marshmallow out of your belly button?
Rach, y'know I can see you naked any time I want.
What?
Oh, c'mon. We'll have, we'll have a big party, and no-one'll know who's with who.
Yeah, and I met this really hot single mom at the store. What's an elf to do?
Okay, so I'm gonna be the only one standing there alone when the ball drops?
Hey, y'know, this is so not what I needed right now.
What's the matter?
Okay. Okay fine, y'know what? We will let Ross and Joey decide. Hiiiii, Ross! Sweetie.
Oh, come on! This is crazy! Can't we just flip a coin?!
No! Coins hate me!
Hey there, you handsome thing.
Wow, this cologne really is every bit as good as Georgio.
I'm sorry, as I was saying the store number is wrong, and I'm sorry but that's... Oh my God!!
None for me.
Okay sorry, whew.
Okay, that's a fire. Oh yeah. Oh yeah.
Excuse me, I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to call you back, I've got a Schemp in my office. What are you doing?
That is great. Hey, y'know who doesn't have to job hunt? Ross. He works at the university.
Oh hi! Y'know, I just wanted to see if there were any leads on the old job front.
Oh no! But I just walked past three sales and I didn't go in. How strong am I?
Yeah.
Oh so you know that, you guys talked about that, so you get along, so you think you're gonna go out?
All right, y'know what? I-I'm sorry. I will try to tone it down and uh stop yelling.
Yeah, I didn't want you to get hit by the boom!
Well it hit me anyway! And it would've hurt a lot less if I had finished that last beer.
You won't boss me around anymore?
I won't boss you around.
OK, so that's... that's what, two bottles? And yet somehow we went through five?
I had one glass.
I had about a mugful in this lovely 'I got boned at the Museum of Natural History' mug.
Oooooh.
Ooooooh.
Oh, god, this is great! The plane is gone, so it looks like I'm stuck here with you guys.
Here we come, walkin' down thethis doesn't smell like Mom's.
No, it doesn't, does it? But you wanted lumps, Ross? Well, here you go, buddy, ya got one.
Hey, we all had better plans. This was nobody's first choice.
Oh, really? So why was I busting my ass to make this delicious Thanksgiving dinner?
Honey, you're not gonna make enough money to help Frank and Alice just by selling knives.
Are you sure?
No!
No-no, I know that, but I just have to make enough money for the second part of my plan.
What's the second part of your plan?
Mon, if uh you were at lunch alone, how come it cost you uh 53 dollars?
Oh, no problem. You can borrow it, by the way. Here are your keys, hon.
Okay.
You know what probably happened? Someone musta stolen my credit card.
And sorta just put the receipt back in your pocket?
Oh! See just I'm right back where I started! Aww, this sucks! Being alone, sucks!
Y'know, you should never be allowed to talk to people!
I know! I know!
Well, y'know, you're-you're gonna meet somebody! You're a great catch! Y'know when I was telling all those guys about you, I didn't have to lie once.
Really?
Yes-yes, just a few seconds and she'd still be with us-nothing about an assistant buyer?
Yes, so close. Mrs. Lynch, I know that this is an emotional and difficult time, for all of us. But by any chance did Joanna send any paperwork your way before... it happened.
No. Nothing. Imagine, if she had just stepped off that curb a few seconds later.
No, I'm sorry. I have to go.
Good morning!
Oh, I know, I'm sorry you guys. You're just gonna have to get used to the fact that I will not be dating Ross.
I don't know. Whatever I was feeling, I'm... not.
But you guys came so close.
Here he is. Hi. Guys, this is Russ.
Hhhhiiiii.
Yeah, Joey honey, I don't know if this'll mean anything to you but you'll always be pre-approved with us.
No, I don't. It's like, ya know, you work your whole life for somethin' and you think that when you get it it's never gonna be as good as you thought it would be. But this so was. Ya know, it changed everything. Like the other day, I got this credit card application, and I was pre- approved. Huh? I've never been pre-approved for anything in my life.
I'm sorry man.
No, that means nothin to me.
Uhhhaahh.
Well, y'know what though you guys? I really appreciate that but I think I'm just gonna take Sebastian to the charity.
Yes! We found you a really cute and funny guy from Chandler's work!
Yeah and I-I found you one too who is not a weirdo.
Are you sure?! Because our guy smells incredible!
Uh, would you stop it with that already?!
Sure, you know what? Come on, we'll just tell them that there was like a problem with like the "engine".
Okay, you know what? You're going to have to call that plane and tell them to swing around and come and pick me up.
I can't do that.
I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to step aside, Miss.
Look, If I don't get to London!! He is going to marry that other girl!!!
Ohh, here you are. I was looking for you before. Joshua's gone so you and Emily are free to go.
I'm sorry, I, I just need a little time.
Okay.
That's okay. She's still in there enjoying her fake party and uh, it's too late to do any of the things I had planned, so...
Oh, Ross, I'm sorry. I completely ruined your evening.
No Monica! I'm serious! Oh, maybe I should just forget about it. Become a lesbian or something.
Umm... I'm never gonna getting married!
Yeah you will! The right guy is just around the corner! Okay, are we done with that?
Any woman would be lucky to have ya.
Well maybe it would make me feel better if I slept with Joey.
Well actually thanks, but I think I'm just gonna hang out here tonight. It's been kinda a long day.
Right, you're not even getting your honeymoon, God.. No, no, although, Aruba, this time of year... talk about your- -big lizards... Anyway, if you don't feel like being alone tonight, Joey and Chandler are coming over to help me put together my new furniture.
Yes, and we're very excited about it.
Okay, sure.
Hey Pheebs, you wanna help?
Uh well, I guess I'm not gonna miss the fact that you're never allowed to move the phone pen.
I have one.
Good! Great! You can go first.
Good that's a good one. Okay, Monica, anything? Y'know? Does Rachel move the phone pen?
Aw, sometimes. Always, actually.
Ok, look you guys, I really don't want to get into this right now. I think it'll just make everyone uncomfortable.
Not for you.
All right, what's goin' on?
Fine. All right, fine.
Yeah.
Oh, Phoebe, are you still on hold? I was supposed to call my Dad back like two hours ago.
Wait. Give him a minute.
Noo! Oh, it's okay, it's okay, baby, baby, baby.
Oh, yeah, he clipped on, he said call him as soon as you get a chance, he's at Flimby's.
What's Flimby's?
Oh totally, totally. Y'know it's not that big of deal, we already kinda did it once y'know.
I know!
Oh gosh, listen if you and Chip do it tonight, promise me you'll tell me everything.
I know, but y'know, this time you're gonna definitely know whether or not you did it!
I know, I know. And oh, and this time Chip promised that-that this time it will last at least for an entire song!
Ugh! Get out! Get out! Go! Come on! No! Not in there! He's in there!
I'll be right back.
You and your ice.
Did you really hear a bear?
Go-go!
Oh, no-no-no, no-no-no, it has become, it has-yeah. Oh no, those were four great dates.
I mean maybe you didn't hear about a serious relationship called me and Joshua?
Oh, I thought you guys had just been on like four dates, I didn't realise that had become anything, yet.
Oh. Yeah?
Yeah. Oh, yeah. And I mean, the connection, I mean y'know, emotionally, mentally, physically...
Well I assume the ah, happy couple isn't up yet. Did you guys hear them last night?
Shhh! Shhhh! Joey's asleep.
After he passed out, we put the sand around him to keep him warm.
Oh, yeah, I don't know what they were doing, but at one point sea turtles actually came up to the house.
Good morning.
Well maybe he saw your hand slip briefly from the ten and two o'clock position.
Fourth gear!!
What?! What does he want?! I wasn't doing anything!
Maybe it's uh Sergeant Sagittarius coming back to flirt some more!
It's a different guy!
Well, wait a minute, you're the boss! Why don't you just yell at them? Or, fire them?
Ohhh!
I mean they're trying to do everything they can to make me quit, and if there were any other job, I would. But this is something I've been waiting for my whole life.
I would love too, but I can't! I mean I just can't, you know that I'm not good at confrontation.
Hey, you know what you can do? I remember reading about this director, I think it was Orson Wells, who at the beginning of the movie would hire somebody, just so he could fire them in front of everybody. Then they would all know, who's boss.
Well, I do, but you're just gonna have to actually look at this as more of an investment than a cat.
Okay, a thousand.
I thought you wanted to adopt your cat.
Okay, yeah, I just wanted a cat.
Obviously you know how to haggle, so I'm not gonna try and take you on. Okay? So $800 and I don't call the cops because you're robbing me blind! Blind! Just take cat, leave the money, and run away! Run away! Damnit! Cat, can't you at least smile or something?! Okay, did anybody just hear that? Anybody?
Oh, okay. Uhh, well let's see. You're about-well uh, this one is large. And this one-
Yeah!
Gloves. Brown, leather dress gloves.
Also large?
Yeah! Okay, two larges coming right up!
Wherever I go. Come on you and me, we'll-we'll start a new group, we're the best ones.
Phoebe? I'm sorry about the whole lifting out thing. You gotta come with me!
Come where?
Okay, but try and get Joey too.
Pheebs, you mind if I speak to Rachel alone for a sec?
I think I just shipped 3,000 bras to personnel. Oh honey, I gotta go. Mark, I need you!
Oh! Oh my God! What did I just do?
What?
Okay, bye-bye.
Ow! Ross!!
I dunno. Y'know to me he'll always be "Jack Geller, walks in while you're changing."
Really?!
Yeah, I dreamt that he saved me from a burning building and he was so brave and so strong! And it's making me look at him totally differently. Y'know, I mean he used to be just, y'know "Jack Geller Monica and Ross's dad" and now he's he's "Jack Geller, dream hunk."
Y'know dad, Chandler is one of Ross's very best friends!
Yeah, Ross sure is a great guy, y'know I've always felt that how a young man turns out is a reflection on his father.
Yeah, I know, go long. Y'know, it's like all I'm doing is running back and forth from the huddle.
Math!! You're giving me math! All right, look y'know what, forget about it, you go for the girl, we'll see who gets her.
Chandler, I want you to run a post pattern to the left, okay. And sweetie..
Well ah, you wanna just stay out there?
Can I see that for second.
Hey, so he stole a couple bucks from me! At least he bought me something with it!
Ohh, that is soo sad.
And what are you laughing at, Miss `My-keg-sucking-boyfriend-is-stealing-from-me!'
That's mine!! Now, would you both please start acting like adults? And get me my cough drops!
Fine.
Thank you. Hey-hey umm, uh, is there, is there any such thing as an annulment shower?
Oh Ross, come on! This is not, this is not a marriage!! This is the world's worst hangover! Ross, listen, if you do not get this annulment, I will!
All right. All right, I'll do it.
Wait! Wait! There is the train station!
Oh, okay.
No! You guys can't leave yet! You have to stay, we-we got the whole big thing planned!
Yes, we have something we have to get to.
Uhh, yeah, I think I'm going to take-off too.
What big thing?
So, Spin The Bottle works like this I spin the bottle, it lands on Gunther, so I would have to kiss Gunther. (She crawls over to where Gunther is sitting and sees the look of anticipation on Gunther's face and decides not to kiss him.) All right. Who wants to go first?
But y'know, I never really had anything to worry about. Ross was never very good at the flirting thing.
Uhh, no, no, it bothered me when he slept with other women.
And thank you, for that.
What? What-what, what are talking about? It-it worked with you.
Oh! Y'know what? You're right! We meet, you flirted and then bamn nine years later you had me!
Oh, no, no no. I meant that he's gonna be paying that other woman beause she's a professional.
What?
Well you said that he's paying the people who are playing.
Well, I'm not gonna be the only one who's not getting paid.
Well, but Pheebs.
Oh, alright. The weirdest place would have to be... ... oh, the foot of the bed.
You did not go!
Come on.
Step back.
We have a winner!
Yeah, my mom got my dad's season tickets in the divorce, so she just gave them to me.
Uhh, a T-shirt that says, "I don't belong here."
You have Knicks tickets?
Yeah, apparently, they're pretty good seats.
Yeah.
Hey, I was doin' great before I found out about you. You think it's easy for me to see you with Julie?
What?
I was doing great with Julie before I found out about you.
Then you should have said something before I met her.
I didn't know then. And how come you never said anything to me.
Yeah you like totally let him wash his feet in the pool of your inner power.
What?
Do you not remember the puppet guy?
And his puppet too.
Yeah ok, well at least I didn't let some guy into the forest of my righteous truth on the first date.
Oh my God!! You just ruined the thing I was practicing the whole way home, but I'm soo happy!
Hey Mon, little question for ya! How do you think this suit will look on an assistant buyer?
Okay, the owner of Allesandro's came over to yell at me, but instead I made him some sauce, and he offered me the job as head chef!!
Can you believe it? I finally get to run my own kitchen!
Ohh, you've waited soo long.
...and then they came back from smoking and they had made all of the decisions without me!
Rachel? Do you smoke?
Oh no, my dad's a doctor and he would always tell me just horror stories......about ghosts and goblins who totally supported the princess's right to smoke.
That doesn't seem fair.
I know! It's like I'm being punished for not having this disgusting, poisoning habit!
And your horoscope says, "On the fifth a special someone is going to give you a gift."
Okay, Chandler!
Okay.
Oh, well thank you in advance.
Op, but the twelfth brings a lover's spat.
Ugh! No more crying! Please! I just dumped one cry baby, I'll dump you too!
Okay! I was gonna wait 'til uh, it was official y'know? But I got so excited I just had to tell you guys because you're my best friends.
I think I'm gonna cry!
I'm gonna ask Monica to marry me.
Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh Chandler!! You guys are gonna be so happy!
Yeah, I feel kinda bad for them, but I'm also really psyched 'cause I don't have to move in here!
No-no, they just had a big blowout over what to do with my room.
What?! Over a stupid room!
Oh no, yeah no, that part's great!
What's all this about you guys fighting?! Is this really over a room?! I mean, that is so silly!
All right. All right Phoebe I will let you have him, but you owe me; you owe me big!
No-no they do but, you just have to wait.
Rachel, listen-I mean, if you let me have him then I will really owe you one.
Yeah! You're such a great friend!
Ohh...
Ross, I have been walking around like this since the plane! I can-you have so crossed a line.
Hey, you wet my pants!
Whoa, what kind of party was this?
Rach! Wait! The men's room is that way.
Ugh!
Well, people missed you in there. And in fact, there was actually a request for "Smelly Cat".
Well, you know, honey, I don't think everybody gets Smelly Cat. You know, I mean, if all you've ever actually had are healthy pets, then, whoosh!
It's not even that. I used to do my songs because it made me happy, but now it's like, it's just all about the money.
Really? From who?
Well, from me. And I know it's not your big money song, but it's my favorite.
No Paul, I don't know anything about you! Y'know, like-like your childhood! Tell me about your childhood!
Yeah that's great Paul, but y'know I wanna know what--Wow, those are really great! I just wanna know what, what is behind this-this strong, silent exterior. Y'know they say that still waters run deep and I wanna swim in yours.
Are you talking about having sex?
Normal.
Okay, well then how about puberty! Come on, that's always a painful time! Y'know your friends invite you to a slumber party and then they stick your hand in warm water while you're sleeping so that you pee in your sleeping bag.
Yes, I'm sorry. Do you have any extra pants? Umm, my friend seems to have had a little accident.
Hi!
Miss? May I help you?
Can I change a hundred?
Changing one hundred! Good luck sir.
OK, sorry to break up this party, but I've got resumes to fax before work tomorrow...
Heh... I was bluffing.
A-ha! And... what is bluffing? Is it not another word for... lying?
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Rach, Rach, we gotta settle.
Uh, no. Wait, you know what, this is the outfit that makes my calves look fat. Nevermind.
I don't know, you might be the first one.
Rach, did you check the machine?
Well, Joey, I wrote a little song today. It's called Get Up.
All right! You can have the chair.
I don't understand! Last time you went out with her you said she was a 'big, dull dud.'
Well, not at first.
What is she doing here?
Well, I think I judged her too quickly, and this time we were able to take the relationship to the next level.
Well, last time I almost got fired. You must end it, you must end it now!
Okay. Umm, well, first I would like to start by apologizing for kissing you and uh, for yelling at you.
Ah, first, I-I would like to say thank you for agreeing to see me again.
That's quite all right, but I feel obligated to tell you that this meeting is being videotaped.
Fair enough.
Now you're probably going to hire one of the people who did not ah, who did, who did not umm, yell at you and storm out, and I think that's a big mistake and here's why. I made a huge fool of myself and I came back, that shows courage. When I thought you wanted sex in exchange for this job, I said no. That shows integrity. And, I was not afraid to stand up for myself and that shows courage. Okay umm, now I know I already said courage, but y'know you gotta have courage. And umm, and finally when I thought you were making sexual advances in the workplace, I said no and I was not litigious. {By the way, litigious means to want to litigate and litigate is to make a lawsuit against. So she didn't want to sue him. Don't worry, I had to look it up too.} So there you go, you got, you got courage, you got integrity, you got courage again, and not litigious. Look Mr...
Ohh, OK, OK, OK, well, basically, lately, I've uh, I've uh, sort of had feelings for you.
Ohh, ohh.
When, when were you... under me? Rach. Rachel do you, I mean, were you, uh. . . What?
You've had feelings for me?
Yeah, what, so? You had feelings for me first.
Okay you're right. I'll hire Hilda tomorrow. Dumb old perfect for the job Hilda!
Uh-huh. No, I hear what you're saying and-and-and that makes a lot of sense but can I just say one more thing? Look how pretty!
Let's see. Oh my God! Oh... But no! No! You can't-you can't hire him, because that-it's not professional. Umm, this is for me yes? Thanks.
Let me see this guy. W-H-Wow! Don't show this to Monica! And don't tell her about the W-H-Wow!
Hey-hey-hey Joey!
Y'know what Tag, if we went down to the office you would see those contracts sitting on your desk.
Yes I did! And I put a little Post-It on it that said, "Must go out today," and underlined today three times and, and then I put a little heart in the corner because I didn't want to seem to bossy.
I'm telling you, you never gave them to me.
No, I would see you looking embarrassed because they are not on my desk!
Or maybe you would see me looking embarrassed because you are talking on the phone with your crotch!
Uhh, let's just stay clear of 'I'm the guy that's doing you daughter' and you should be ok.
Listen honey, can you keep dad occupied, I'm gonna go talk to mom for a while.
Ok, do you have any ideas for any openers?
Ok people, I want you to take a piece of paper, here you go, and write down your most embarassing memory. Oh, and I do ask that when you're not using the markers, you put the caps back on them because they will dry out.
Hi Dr. Greene. So, uh, how's everything in the uh, vascular surgery....game?
Yeah. Just, if it's possible, could you leave him somewhere and go have sex with another guy?
Oh, you go out with him.
Oh, really?!
I'll try.
So you guys having any luck getting rid of the entertainment center?
No! They didn't even talk to each other. God, how was I supposed to know they were having problems?
None.
They didn't fight a lot?
In my day, divorce was not an option.
Hey, look who's up.
There's been a teeny-teeny change in plans. It turns out that I'm not free tonight. So...
I'm Rachel Green.
Thank goodness.
Really?! Well, that's just lovely, isn't it? I must've missed your call, even though I didn't leave the flat all day.
Oh well, no I...
Hi! Just so you know, we-we didn't mean to fog you, we thought you were like a yeti or something.
We're-we're really sorry we fogged you.
Okay.
Okay.
Yesss?
Wh... So... If neither of you are married by the time you're 40, you're gonna marry Joey.
Are you serious?!
Yeah, I locked him years ago!
Yep, we shook on it. Yeah but believe me that is not how he wanted to seal the deal.
Oh, seriously?
Ok, ok, ok, I will, I will, I, hey, I will clean the apartment for two months.
Ok, I, I will do your laundry for one month.
No.
Alright, I tell you what, I'll give this to you now if you can tell me where we keep the dustpan.
Agghhh.
Y'know, bonus night. Y'know, when two people break up but they get back together for just one night.
Oh, I know. Hey, y'know what we never did? Oh no, not that. We uh, we never had bonus night!
A what?
One night, just-just sex. No strings attached?
Yeah-yeah, we never had that,
I'm so glad, I'm so glad you shared. And I'm glad that you're done. What do you say we umm...
Oh... I'm sorry. I... I-I don't mean-I didn't mean to stifle you. I... This is all just a little overwhelming.
Oh Rachel, I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to overwhelm you. It's just that, when those gates open, you... Hard to close 'em. But they are closed now. Believe me.
I would really like that.
That was...so good.
Oh, well thank you for taking your tongue out of my sister's mouth long enough to tell me that.
Yeah that's right you weren't thinking! Y'know what? Let me give you something to think about!
Oh wait-hold it! But then I started thinking and I stopped the kissing.
Look I-I realize if anything were to happen with me and Jill then nothing could ever happen with us!
What?!
That's your whole name, okay of course it is! Okay, well let's-let's just have a look-see here.
Uh-huh, go on.
That's it. That's my whole name.
I know I haven't worked in an office before, and I really don't have a lot of experience, but uh...
Oh come on, what are you talking about? You've got three years painting houses. Two whole summers at T.G.I. Friday's, come on!
You think I trust you with it?! No! We're gonna split it! You take half and I take half!
Oh no-no-no-no-no, no you don't!
Oh yes! Oh yes!
Well that's not fair, you've already had some!
What? Oh, well then y'know what? I think Monica would be very interested to know that you called her cheesecake dry and mealy.
...I am jealous of her?! I mean who does she think she is?! Princess Caroline?!
Who?!

You're jealous of Princess Caroline?
Do I have my own castle?
Um... yeah. Well, I mean, when I first met you, y'know, I thought maybe, possibly, you might be...
Well yeah! ...Oh God. I- just- I thought- Good, Shelley. I'm just gonna go flush myself down the toilet now... Okay, goodbye...
...Couldn't enjoy a cup of noodles after that. I mean, is that ridiculous? Can you believe she actually thought that?
You did?
Yeah, but then you spent Phoebe's entire birthday party talking to my breasts, so then I figured maybe not.
Well, he didn't say, but it was a fire. I'm guessing not very good. Come on, we gotta go!
Oh my God! Oh my God! Thank you! That was the fire department, there was a fire at our place!
Oh my God! How bad was it?
Come on!
What are you smiling about? What is so funny?
What? What? He's interested in you. He-he likes your hair, he just wants to know how you got here.
Nice hair. What'd ya do? Swim here?
Okay, that's it, I can't take it anymore.
Oh, please. Sweetie it's hopeless, okay, I'm just gonna go.
What?!
Oh no, no-no-no, that's not, not, not, what he is doing. He's just, he's just really romantic.
It's from Ross, it's a love bug.
Wow! Somebody wants people to know you have a boyfriend.
Ah, excuse me, are you Rachel Green?
Yes.
That's right, I wanna do it with you! I've been trying to fight it, but you just said all the right things.
All right! Y'know what? That's it! You wanna do it?! Let's do it!
Huh?
I-I-I-I did?
Yeah! Ohh, I've been waitin' so long to get on that body!
I found him! Very funny, come here! That is exactly why I've come here to talk to you okay?
I'd love that. I would loooove... So uh, so where is sweet little Ben? I would love to have a little...
Gotcha!!
Rach, do you want some sugar in your coffee?
Yes oh--Do I want sugar in my coffee? No, just some milk would be good Carol. Thanks. Okay, do you remember all that stuff I taught you yesterday?
He didn't turn me down! He's at the game isn't he? I got the date, I'm just not on it!
I have an extra ticket. An extra ticket. Not, two tickets, I have an extra ticket.
So the first time you ask a guy out, he-he turns you down?
Okay, it's ready. Come on.
What's ready?
Uh, I will see you... and I'll raise you. What do you say... want to waste another buck?
Couldn't be more out.
Me too. Rachel.
No, not this time. So... what'd you have?
I'm not telling.
I know, so do I. Oh Phoebe, I'm so glad you made me do this. OK, lemme se yours.
Upstairs in the bathroom right before you felt up mom.
Oh that looks so good, oh I love it.
Ahh. OK, let's see yours again.
Phoebe we just saw mine, let me see yours.
Ok, ok, that's fine. Fine. Hey, I'm sorry about that spill before. Only $98.50 to go.
Excuse me, sir. Hi, you come in here all time. I was just wondering, do you think there's a possibility that you could give me an advance on my tips?
Huh?
Hey. Ross, did you know Mom and Dad are going to Puerto Rico for Thanksgiving?
No, they're not.
Wha... forget it Ross, no, I am not gonna stand here and make a list of. . .
Monica, pigeons learn faster that you.
Hey, Rach, you know what? I think, I think I know what'll make you feel better. How 'bout you make a list about me.
C'mon Rachel.
OK, you're whiney, you are, you're obsessive, you are insecure, you're, you're gutless, you know, you don't ever, you don't just sort of seize the day, you know. You like me for what, a year, you didn't do anything about it. And, uh, oh, you wear too much of that gel in your hair.
Oh, y'know, it's just like hats, and a shirt, and CD's, just sort of stuff that you've left here.
Yeah. Ahh, here's a box of your stuff.
What?!
What are you doing? Are you trying to hurt me? Or something?
No. Ross, it, it just seems that y'know it's time we-we y'know, move on. I mean, I mean don't' you think?
Oh yeah, scared the hell out of me. I thought we'd lost you forever. Pheebs, you lie down?
Pheebs, what-what are you doing?
I was preparing you for my-didn't you think I was dead? Did that not come off?
Yeah, thanks. And listen, can you do me a favor? Could you just umm, wake me up in a couple hours, y'know if you can.
Monica!
Saving, saving, saving me from the pleasant conversation with the interesting man, saving me?
What?
I was saving you.
Oh, see from where I was sitting I uh. . .
OK, Ross, listen to me, I am not yours to save.
Well, that shouldn't be a problem. I mean I work in fashion and all I meet are eligible straight men.
You are falling fast asleep. Deeper. Deeper. Deeper. You are now completely asleep. You don't need to smoke. Cigarettes don't control you. You are a strong, confident woman, who does not need to smoke. A strong, confident woman.
And y'know what, I just realised, in the last year I've only gone out with two guys, Richard and Julio. You gotta help me out here, you gotta set me up, you gotta get me back in the game.
Pete, can I get you something else?
Yeah, a slice of cheesecake and-and a date if you're given' 'em out.
Okay. Oh, uh, wait a minute, y'know what? I uh, I can't decide this. Umm, okay, just hold on a second.
Yeah. Umm, unless you wanna come inside?
Yeah!
Okay, yeah!
Umm, hi!
And remember how you always said you were afraid the landlord would find out and then tear it down?
Okay, remember uh, remember how you told me that your grandmother put up that wall to make that into two bedrooms?
Yeah?
Yeah?
Do you really not know where I'm going with this? It left! It's one huge room!
Great!! It was very, very nice to meet you sir--Ow! Hey! What are you doing?! Are you crazy!
Okay. Okay!
1...2! Y'know what? You're young; you probably don't have glaucoma.
Okay. You've got a small, minor infection in that left eye. I want you to take these drops three times a day and you'll be as good as new.
Yeah, no, I don't-I don't put things in my eye.
Well, if you see him, will you please tell him that I'm looking for him and that this I am not gonna throw up!
Is Joey Tribbiani here?
Umm, no.
That-that's always good news. Are you okay?
Me? I'm great! I'm fine! I'm sooo good!! But, you know who's not great?! Men! You're a man right Ross?!
No, she left a message. But it-it kinda got erased. There's just something wrong with your machine.
Well, I-I-I don't know how this fits into your whole "seizing" thing but um, Emily called you today.
You talked to her?
Well, okay, what-what did she say?
Well, uh something about having second thoughts about the wedding and did you guys make a mistake breaking up and uh, she wants you to call her.
Honey, you have nothing to prove. And if you really like this girl, I don't flirting is the right thing to...
Oh, mine! Mine! Mine! Okay, here goes. Prepare yourselves for some Class A flirting.
Okay, hold on. Okay.
You'll see. Okay. Oh, what's-what's her name?
Caitlin!
"Pheebs, can't make it, got a date. Talk to you later. Big Daddy." Big Daddy?
Umm, I think he's still out. What's wrong?
Well, I'll tell you Rachel Karen Green, I had plans with Joey tonight and he left me this note.
Oh that's a nickname we were trying out.
Hey, y'know what nickname never caught on? The Ross-A-Tron!
Yeah! You and that girl from that copy place, which yesterday you took full responsibility for!!
You bet.
And for the record, it took two people to break up this relationship!!
I didn't know what I was taking full responsibility for! Okay?! I didn't finish the whole letter!
What?!!
Ross, I'm doing everything that I can, I've got everybody looking for him, and I- Oh! Who is it?
I know, I know, I'm sorry-
No, y'know what, I guess it's partially my fault. Y'know, I shouldn't've, uh, asked you to start off with a monkey. I should've started you off with like a pen or a pencil.
Animal Control.
See? I've even called Animal Control!
Oh honey, are you jealous of Paolo? Oh, c'mon, I'm so much happier with you than I ever was with him.
Ok, uh, Billy Dreskin, Pete Carney, Barry, and uh, oh, Paolo.
Oh yes, the weenie from Torrini.
Really?
Oh please. That Paolo thing was barely a relationship. All it really was was just, ya know, meaningless animal sex. Ok, ya know, that sounded soooo much better in my head.
I, I didn't say any... I sw... I did not say anything, I swear. He stopped by.
No. You know, sometimes just things doesn't work out.
And this has nothing to do with the fact that he needs a note to get out of gym.
Listen, the next time you talk to him, can you ask him which one the strongest Power Ranger is?
Oh, yeah.
I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love- and that'd be it? ..Ross?
Remember when we were in high school together?
Yeah.
Yes, yes!
Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here..
Yeah Melissa, I don't want to be known as the uh, office bitch, but I will call your supervisor.
Oh yeah. All right, back to work.
Hey! Isn't that Tag's backpack.
Great! That's great Monica! Great! Now, Chandler, you want to give us a smile?
Okay.
No? All right, here's the truth um, Joey said what he said, because um, I'm attracted to you.
Uh, yeah, well, see, he... Joey knows, that I'm-I'm very insecure about my back and, and...you're hugging me, so obviously you are not repulsed by it, yeah!
Wait-wait a minute; that doesn't make any sense.
Wow.
Yeah, I admit it. I have a crush on you, and uh, and, and I know that's crazy because we work together, and-and nothing could ever happen, and the last thing I want to do is-is to freak you out or make you feel uncomfortable. Which is why it would be really great if you said something right about now.
Monica? You gonna be very proud of me. I just got us dates with two unbelievably cute nurses.
Yeah, that's when if you get the babies out by the end of the month, they give you 2% financing.
Yeah.
Oh my!
They're male nurses.
Is that him again? Tell him I'd come to the phone, but my ankles are weighin' me down.
Hello?
Hi.
Listen, I... I don't think this is the best time.
Look, can, can you do something for me?
I don't know! I mean, we still care about each other. There's a history there. 'S'like you and Carol.
Sex in his chair.
What, uh... what were you thinking?
No! No no, it is nothing like me and Carol!
Please. If she said to you, "Ross, I want you on this couch, right here, right now," what would you say?
Ah, hah-hah-hah-ho, yeah, he wishes. Oh, I'm sorry, look at me. OK, Michael, let's talk about you.
I mean he just started going out with her.
Is this guy, uhh, an old boyfriend?
Alright.
OK, OK. So, you ever get a pet with a girlfriend?
Oh honey, I'm sorry we can't help you there, 'cause we're cuddlily sleepers. Okay, I'm late for work.
Wrong! Now you're single. It's actually secret option number three, you meet her at the gate. That way she knows you love her.
Okay, this is good, this is good. All right listen, I have one. Janice likes to cuddle, at night, which, you know I'm all for. But, uh, you know when you want to go to sleep, you want some space. So, uh, how do I tell her that without, you know, accidentally calling her fat or something.
Oh.
All right are you guys gonna come down?
Oh, I know. Hey, y'know what we never did? Oh no, not that. We uh, we never had bonus night!
Uh-huh.
Way to go guys. Y'know, you-you were really good at the stuff too.
A what?
Y'know, bonus night. Y'know, when two people break up but they get back together for just one night.
Are you serious?! Chandler, we ate an entire cheesecake two days ago and you want more?
So just bring it back downstairs, what's the problem?
I can't seem to say goodbye.
Well I've forgotten what it tastes like okay?!
It was cheesecake. It was fine. It had a buttery, crumbly, graham cracker crust, with a very rich yet light, cream cheese filling... Wow! My whole mouth just filled with saliva!
Yeah, sure Mr. Zelner, for you anything-minute. Okay. Fine. Abort the plan, abort the plan.
Let's roll!
Hello Rachel, you uh, got a minute?
Uh actually, I'd like to speak with both of you.
Okay. Uh, well can we, can we get you anything Mr. Zelner? Maybe some chocolates?
Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. Maybe it's not so bad. How did you leave it?
That is never good.
Then I got all needy and clingy.
She said she'd call me.
Ohh!
Hey, can I borrow the key to your house so I can run across the street and make a copy?
No, the other thing. I really think it's great they work things out.
Yeah. There's no breaking them up, is there?
Sure! Here.
Thank you. Now are you sure? Because once I make a copy, there's no turning back.
I am not a baby! You know what? I swear to god, just because you get so uptight every time we...
Willya relax? Look around. No pagan altars, no piles of bones in the corners, they're fine. Go like this.
I said we are not going to do it, okay? Sometimes you can be such a, a big baby.
Sure, every time, you're such a princess...
You know what?
Excuse me, I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to call you back, I've got a Schemp in my office. What are you doing?
I'm sorry, as I was saying the store number is wrong, and I'm sorry but that's... Oh my God!!
Okay, that's a fire. Oh yeah. Oh yeah.
I'm sorry. But ah, hey, oh, somebody's off the phone, how 'bout a glass of wine by the fire, I could get it going again.
Ross you're not listening to me, I don't have time to stop.
Oh, it's a tattoo! That's weird, Phoebe doesn't... Wait that's Ursula! That's not Phoebe that is Ursula!
She's just doing her job!
You sick bastards!
Re! Re! Then I can watch that! Rewind it! Rewind it!
Hey! What's up? Oh my God! What am I doing?!!
I'm sorry, what did you just say? Did you just say hi? Oh my God, Ross, Ross, Ben just said 'Hi'.
Ok, we can do this now, can't we Ben? Yes we can, yes we can. There. I did it. I did it. Look at that, oh, stays on and everything. Hi.
Hi.
Wha, what?
Ben just said hi.
Ok Ross, just so you know, calling it a poopie diaper doesn't make this process any cuter.
Yeah, well they suck too.
Ok, and then you take the poopie diaper and you put it in the poopie diaper pail.
Hello.
It's us.
That cute waiter guy from your restaurant, the one that looks like a non-threatening Ray Liotta?
Since when do take naps in that position. Oh God Monica, tell me you were waiting for a guy! Please tell me you were waiting for a guy!
Yes. Yes, I was. A guy. From work. I'm seeing a guy from work! Ha!
Uh-huh, that one!
Y'know what, just give me a second and I'll be out of your hair. I'm just gonna grab a jacket. When I get back, I want every little detail. Maybe that's him.
well, now, wait a second, who did I just put as my "In case of emergency" person?
Um... unless, unless I use yours.
Hah, no no no no no no no no no no.
That's insurance fraud.
Well, alright, then, forget it. Might as well just go home. Ow ow ow ow!
Really! God Ross, what were you thinking? I know it's really shallow, but a part of me wants him again.
I don't know, but-but look how shiny!
I can't believe you bought this.
Oh, well get in line missy. So, can I have a ride stud?
Hop in. Get ready for the smoothest ride of your life.
Eh, I'm just so sorry I put you through it. And, I y'know, I don't want to get back together over a machine.
Hi, it's me. I've been trying to reach you all night. I feel awful. Please, Ross, you gotta know there is nothing between me and Mark. This whole break-up thing is just stupid.
Yeah!!
Na-huh.
So, I love you.
Well, she-she ob-obviously saw the tire tracks that were leading up to the closed garage.
How did you know we were here?
Umm...
Obviously.
Elizabeth, what are you doing here?!
Mon, honey you're not dying. I'm just moving out. Y'know, I mean we're gonna see each other all the time.
Wow! Mon, thanks! I love this plate!
Something to remember me by!
But still, it's a big change. The end of an era, you might say!
Are you okay? You're not blinking.
Oh my God! Oh my God! Thank you! That was the fire department, there was a fire at our place!
Hello? Uh, Rachel. Great, someone is in our apartment. Call the cops!
You're on the phone!
Oh my God! How bad was it?
Well, he didn't say, but it was a fire. I'm guessing not very good. Come on, we gotta go!
I mean I'm probably 98% happy, maybe 2% jealous. And I mean what's 2%? That's nothing.
I'm so happy and not at all jealous.
Oh no! No God, definitely not jealous!
Totally. I'm like 90/10.
Yeah me too.
Mira, Mira, el viejo desnudo est haciendo el hula hoop!
A quin pidio el pollo General Tso?
Pudo aver sido General Tso!
Ewww!
Hola, Joey!
Yeah but-but-but you liked me! Oh my God, I can't believe this, all this time, I liked you and you liked me!
You like me?
Yeah! I mean you're-you're beautiful and smart and sophisticated-a lot of this isn't based on tonight.
But...
Oh no-no-no don't say but! No-no, but's never good! Let's just leave it at, you like me and I like you.
Hey Mon, little question for ya! How do you think this suit will look on an assistant buyer?
Yeah.
Well, those were seals, man.
Okay, the owner of Allesandro's came over to yell at me, but instead I made him some sauce, and he offered me the job as head chef!!
Oh my God!! You just ruined the thing I was practicing the whole way home, but I'm soo happy!
Oh no-no, no-no, they don't want you to put your hands in the pockets until you are out of the store.
Yeah?
Man, I could really flash somebody in this thing.
Why not?!
Well, that's because of a lot of...
So I was with Joshua for an hour today, and he has not asked me out. It's just so frustrating!
Hi!
Hey!
Why don't you ask him out?
Oh, yeah, totally! That's such a turn-on!
Oh, all right. But y'know I gotta say, I don't, I don't think six years counts as an era.
Are you okay? You're not blinking.
I'm fine! I just, I'm thinking how much it's an end of era.
An era is defined as a significant period of time. Now, it was significant to me, maybe it wasn't significant to you!
What is the matter with you?!
Okay, hi. Ladies and gentlemen, back by popular demand, Miss Phoebe Buffay. Wooh!
Phoebe, you're on.
Oh, oh, good.
Thanks, hi. Um, I wanna start with a song that means a lot to me this time of year.
I made a man with eyes of coal And a smile so bewitchin', How was I supposed to know That my mom was dead in the kitchen? La lalala la la la la lalala la la...
Phoebe, if this guy's going through a divorce, is it such a good idea to start going out with him?
He is! But he's getting divorced-Ross! Maybe you know him.
It's not a club.
Hey, divorced men are not bad men!
They have that on the napkins at the club.
I meant er, young, young, I meant young, young to be a doctor. Oh good, Rach.
Aren't you a little cute to be a doctor?
Excuse me?
Thank you.
Right.
No, no, no, no I don't think it's weird, I think, I think umm, in fact, in fact you know what I think?
No, no no no, don't need to know the details.
It's just, it's, it's me. You, you know I've only been with one woman my whole life and she turned out to be a lesbian. So now I've got myself all psyched out, you know, and it's become, like this, this thing and I. . . Well, you just must think I'm weird.
What?
I think it's sexy.
See, there's always one guy. "If I had a wish, I'd wish for three more wishes."
Yeah, see.. you took mine. Chandler, what about you?
Uh, if I were omnipotent for a day, I'd.. make myself omnipotent forever.
Hey Joey. Hi. Hey, buddy.
Hey, Joey, what would you do if you were omnipotent?
Hi! I got you some coffee. To, uh... ...fair enough. So! Do you got anything for me?
Yeah! No! No! No! Don't fall asleep! Okay, I am going to make you some coffee. And I probably won't spill coffee grounds all over the kitchen floor.
Okay, I'm up! I'm up!
Still no luck.
Oh my God! Did you check your entire desk! Did you check all the drawers!
Ok, Well, what about these are white cotton panties. Would they go with whites or delicates?
Well, not myself, but I know other people that have. Ok, you caught me. I'm a laundry virgin.
Uh, well, don't worry, I'll use the gentle cycle. Ok, um, basically you wanna use one machine for all your whites, a whole nother machine for colors, and a third for your uh, your uh, delicates, and that would be your bras and your under-panty things.
Uh, that, that, that would be a judgment call.
He is so cute. So, where did you guys grow up?
No, I-I live with Phoebe. I mean you're alone, alone. And I just-it's just not the time for us. I'm sorry.
I thought this might happen today. Ross, I know the holidays can be rough. Y'know? And it's probably really hard for you to be alone right now.
You're alone.
Ah well, can't blame a guy for trying!
Oh and Okay, and uh if anyone needs help pretending to like it, I learned something in acting class, try uh, rubbing your stomach or uh, or saying "mmm" and uh, oh oh! And smiling , okay?
Yeah, I did, but y'know what? I am really, really trying to cut back, y'know? Good luck, Rach.
I am so on board!
Rachel didn't you just light that?
I've actually been thinking about quitting lately.
Oh sure, every Sunday night I'm telling myself I'm quitting but every Monday morning it's like
Look, I cannot do this right now, okay, I've got a deadline, would you just go home, I'll talk to you later.
Hey, Ross!!! I told you I don't!
Don't yell at me okay, this is the most I've seen you all week.
Yeah, but wait...
Good bye!
Oh sorry didn't mean to interrupt. It's just such a beautiful space; do you do a lot of weddings here?
This would be a beautiful place to get married, yeah, but I wouldn't put the aisle there and I would never have the ceremony there! I mean you'd have the ceremony under this big beautiful arch.
May I help you?
Yes. We're very popular. There's a two-year waiting list. Sorry!
Monica, you should totally put your name down on the list
Oh, okay see I thought, I thought you meant how much was it when it was new, y'know like back then.
It was only 500 bucks.
500 bucks at a flea market?!
Oh no.
Yeah no, I mean it was at a flea market, so it was y'know, it was like a dollar.
OH MY GOD!!! Sorry, I was just imagining what it'd be like to catch the money bouquet.
Yeah, I like Vince a lot, y'know? But, it's just Jason's so sensitive, y'know? And in the long run, I think sensitive it's just better than having just like a really, really, really nice butt. Jason! Definitely Jason! Okay, wish me luck!
Good luck!
Excuse me. Umm, is Vince here?
Oh sure. Vince?!
Man! He just keeps lobbing them up and I just keep knocking them right out of the park!
I'm gonna go talk to uh, a friend.
Yeah, yeah, you go talk to your friend. You tell him, "Nice try."
I think I need a drink.
Yeah!
Oh my God! Listen to you talkin' about having kids. Oh my Joey. Oh, please don't get married before I do.
Didn't you sleep together?
Yeah that really calms me down. And! We have so much in common! She loves sandwiches, sports, although she is a Met fan, not much of an issue now but if were ever to have kids, well that's a...
Okay.
Oh. Oh I just cannot believe Clark stood me up!
'Cos I was gonna say there's no way you could've done the end the way you guys did it back then!
Uh, wait, so you guys are telling me you actually did the routine from eighth grade?
Yeah. But of course we had to update it a little bit. Hey, by the way, great thinking about catching me!
What? We could do it!
I don't know, I mean you were a lot bigger, I mean, stronger back then.
No, that was his costume. See, he's actually an orthodontist, but he came as a regular dentist.
These are from Halloween three years ago.
Oh, look, here's Barry. Did he have to come straight from the office?
Um, you guys, you know when I said before, "thank you, but I don't really need your help"?
Actually, what I think you said was, "don't touch that, and get the hell out of my kitchen."
God, I am so glad you don't have a problem with this, because if you did, I wouldn't even consider applying.
Well, actually, I meant for me. The hiring committee is meeting people all day and...
Oh. Well, I wish I could say no, but you can't stay my assistant forever. Neither can you Sophie, but for different reasons.
Really? Well, in that case...
And that's I'm so glad... there's no problem.
Why don't you just marry her? Oh no, wait a minute you can't, I'm sorry I forgot, she's not a lesbian.
Ross, cough drops, please?
At least I know she's not going out with me to get into R rated movies.
You see Amanda and I have a very special...
You have nothing! You're not even going out! You're her baby sitter! You have a 12-year-old girl's job!
Oh God. Ross, OK, if you care about me at all, you will get the pie out of the man's hood.
I'm done now.

Get the what?
Pie in the hood, pie in the hood. Go.
No, I didn't. I wouldn't say I had the keys unless I had the keys, and I obviously didn't have the keys.
All right, listen, smirky. If it wasn't for you and your stupid balloon, I would be on a plane watching a woman do this right now. But I'm not.
I swear you said you had the keys.
Ooh, ok, that's it. Enough with the keys. No one say keys.
Why would I have the keys?
Well, I-I-I don't know how this fits into your whole "seizing" thing but um, Emily called you today.
Because a car backfired?
Okay, why are you here?
You talked to her?
No, she left a message. But it-it kinda got erased. There's just something wrong with your machine.
No...Yeah, all the time, constantly. It's terrifying. But you know that I figure it...it has to work out.
Yeah. Hmmmm.
It's weird. I always used to assume, that I would meet someone and fall in love and be happy and all that was just a given. But lately it's like what if it's not. Do you ever have that feeling?
Why?
Because, uh-it has to.
So why don't you just let me worry about making the trifle and you just worry about eating it, alright?
Well you're whippin' so slow! Can't you do it any faster?
Joey! Come on! I don't wanna make any mistakes, alright? This is the only dessert and if I screw it up everybody's gonna be like "Oh, remember that Thanksgiving when Rachel screwed up the trifle?"
Oh I am!
Ross, if you don't tell them, then I will!
No! Oh what does he know! Come on Rosita, us chichas got to stick together! You bitch!
Stevie the TV?
Is there a problem?
Hey, y'know what's weird? After you guys get married, when you introduce me to people you're gonna have to say, "This is my brother-in-law Ross." Not, "My friend Ross," "brother-in-law Ross." That's weird isn't it?
Couldn't I just say, "This is Ross?"
So it seemed that my prom date had stood me up, so Ross selflessly, offered to take me.
Don't touch him!
Okay! All right. Umm, all right Wayne, level with me. Okay? I-I keep hearing all these rumors that I might get fired. Okay, they even have actors coming in to read for my part! Come on man, you-you got to give me a second chance! I mean, I love-I love this little guy! Ah-ah!! Okay, that's why you didn't want me to touch him right? Here you go! Okay? Stupid! I can't believe it! God! Hey, how you doin'?
What a nice story!
So Ross was in college and decided to jump at the chance to take a young girl to her high school prom.
Oh well, it's kinda lonely up there, so I just thought I would come out here and get some fresh air.
Yeah I did!
Hey Rachel, what are you doing out here?
Nancy and I were talking about the fall collection.
Oh great!
Yeah, I have to tell Ross that I love him. Now honey, you take care, you don't have those babies until I get back.
Because I'm going to London.
What?! What do you mean you're going to London?
But what about all the "finding-his-flaws" stuff we've been doing?
Yeah, that didn't work.
I love how he cares so much about stuff. If I squint I can pretend he's Alan Alda.
Awwww!!
So I told Carl, 'Nobody, no matter how famous their parents are, nobody is allowed to climb on the dinosaur.' But of course this went in one ear and out.....
Oh good, another dinosaur story. When are those gonna become extinct?
If I was a superhero who could fly and be invisible, that would be the best.
Ross, you guys went out once. You took your kids to Chucky Cheese, and you didn't even kiss her.
I could die.
Yeah, it's-it's tough being single. That's why I'm so glad I found Amanda.
I tell people secrets. It makes them like me.
Oh.
Oh no wait Pheebs, I think for something like that you just ask them to move in with you. But I'm not sure, Chandler?
You're right, I'm sorry. Will you marry me?
Aw, and I was gonna ask you to marry me because I forgot to say hello to you last week.
Okay, how long is this going to go on.
Well I think the length of teasing is directly related to how insane you were so, a long time.
Oh, let me see! Oh, God, is he just the sweetest thing? You must just want to kiss him all over!
Awww, look at Aunt Monica's little boy!
Oh, look, he's got Ross's haircut!
That would be nice.
Pardon?
Oh God, oh. Great, Monica, y'know what, you could've called, I have been up here, I've been worried...
Are you drunk?!
Noooo! I'm lying. I am so drunk.
Monica? Monica!
Water rules!
Zelner! Right! I knew that! I really, really want this job and I think, I think I would be really good at it.
Now you're probably going to hire one of the people who did not ah, who did, who did not umm, yell at you and storm out, and I think that's a big mistake and here's why. I made a huge fool of myself and I came back, that shows courage. When I thought you wanted sex in exchange for this job, I said no. That shows integrity. And, I was not afraid to stand up for myself and that shows courage. Okay umm, now I know I already said courage, but y'know you gotta have courage. And umm, and finally when I thought you were making sexual advances in the workplace, I said no and I was not litigious. {By the way, litigious means to want to litigate and litigate is to make a lawsuit against. So she didn't want to sue him. Don't worry, I had to look it up too.} So there you go, you got, you got courage, you got integrity, you got courage again, and not litigious. Look Mr...
Zelner.
Y'know what? I may regret this but uh, I'm going to give you a shot.
Oh! You are?
Look, I know what's going on here, okay, Mark explained it all to me. He said this is what you guys do.
Oh, please, Ross it was so obvious! It was like you were marking your territory. I mean you might have well have just come in and peed all around my desk!
I would never do that!
Yeah well if, if, if Mark said that, than Mark's an idiot.
Mark's a genius!
Oh my God! You guys this is so great! I mean it's so unexpected! I mean Chandler's birthday is even before mine!
What?! What?! My birthday's not for another month!
That's the surprise!
Surprise!
Wow! This is great! Look at all these cups! This is so weird.
Yes! Yes! Yes, I do! I do know! Frank and Alice are gonna want to keep all of their children!
Okay, Phoebe, honey, you gotta be kidding. I mean, you know you cannot keep one of these babies!
Why not?! Maybe I can, you don't know!
Maybe not! Y'know? Seriously, three babies are a handful maybe they're y'know, looking for a chance to unload one of them. Listen, I-I hate to miss an opportunity just because I didn't ask! Y'know?
Phoebe, no! This is, this is insane.
Phoebe, you were right. I should've never gone to London, and from now on you make all of my decisions for me.
Yes it is! It is true! I went, I went after Ross in stupid London.
London is stupid! Stupid!
Oh... No, I did that for someone once and I'm not comfortable having that kind of power and control over someone's life.
I'll do it!
I'd love that. I would loooove... So uh, so where is sweet little Ben? I would love to have a little...
Okay.
Umm uh, I'll make some coffee and we can uh, chat.
Gotcha!!
I found him! Very funny, come here! That is exactly why I've come here to talk to you okay?
Oh, I called them. And when they ask me what I saw, I can be very generous or very stingy.
I have so got it. There's gonna be rumours about this, there's no way to stop it. Sophie knows, Monica and Phoebe know.
How do Monica and Phoebe know?
Go on.
I can make you a legend. I can make you this generation's Milton Berle.
Well, alright, then, forget it. Might as well just go home. Ow ow ow ow!
well, now, wait a second, who did I just put as my "In case of emergency" person?
That's insurance fraud.
Okay, okay. I hate this.
Thank you. Thank you. I love you.
No, not even close. Forget Vail, forget seeing my family, forget shoop, shoop, shoop.
I'd just like to say that I'm totally behind this experiment. In fact, I'd very much like to butter your head.
Hey, Rach, did you make your money?
Rach, here's your mail.
Thanks, you can just put it on the table.
Definitely! Phoebe, you will not find a single game show host, who's ass I cannot kick.
Oh, of course!
Chuck Woolery?
Say it!
Say we are unagi!
Ok, well, not a problem. We'll just use them to stop the bleeding. Ok. Baggage claim? Ok.
These are, these aren't for you. These are for you. Welcome to our country.
Thank you. I'm from New York.
No way!
I'm telling you, she went to the airport, and she's gonna go for it with Ross!
OK... ah, it's light... ...it rattles... it's... Travel Scrabble! Oooohhh, thank you!
Well, thank you, Melanie.
OK, this one right here is from me.
This one's from Joey... feels like a book. Thinks it's a book... feels like a book. And... ...it's a book!
Oh, it's Dr. Seuss!
Well, here's another question for ya. Uhh, do you know what that silver knob on the toilet does?
They wouldn't have put it there if it didn't do something! How can you not care?
Like this.
Sure! It flushes it.
Okay, good. Now that since you know, when you come over would you mind actually using it?
Yes, Joey, I remember, she's annoying, but you know what she's-she's his girlfriend now. I mean what can we do?
Well, you know I'm not surprised. I mean have you seen them together, they're really cute.
Cute! This is Janice! You remember Janice?
There you go! That's the spirit I'm looking for! What can we do? Huh? All right who's first? Huh? Ross?
Well I'm thinking that Chandler's our friend and Janice makes him happy, so I say we just all be adult about it and accept her.
Well isn't it better that I exchanged it for something that I enjoy and that I can get a lot of use out of?
Huh, well maybe it uh, it changed.
Oh my God! You actually exchanged it!
What did you get?
Credit.
No. Ross, it, it just seems that y'know it's time we-we y'know, move on. I mean, I mean don't' you think?
Oh, y'know, it's just like hats, and a shirt, and CD's, just sort of stuff that you've left here.
What are you doing? Are you trying to hurt me? Or something?
Yes.
Yeah?
Yeah but, maybe it's not what we think. Maybe it's tell Monica I'm sorry I...drank the last of the milk.
What's up? Tell Monica I'm sorry. Tell her yourself!
Oh my God! Chandler just left though!
Or maybe he-he was writing to tell her that-that he's changed his name, y'know? Tell Monica I'm sorry.
I think it means he freaked out and left!
Well-well that's 'cause I went down there and they were all smoking. This is actually the smell of success.
Thanks!
No, I'm-I'm serious!
Okay, there's something different though--Oh my God! You smoked!
I did not!
Yeah, well, it's a Mercedes if I move back home. Oh, it was horrible. He called me young lady.
It's my father. He wants to give me a Mercedes convertible.
That guy, he burns me up.
Ooh, I hate when my father calls me that.
Did he give you that whole "You're-not-up-to-this" thing again?
He's soo lucky, if Janice were a guy, she'd be sleeping with somebody else by now.
Yes, and grumpy.
What are you, stop naming dwarves! Hello, Janice. Hi, I'm so glad that you called, I know I've been acting a really weird lately. And, it's just because I'm crazy about you, and I just got...stupid, and, and scared, and....stupid a couple of more times. I'm sorry. Really?! Really?!
I love you too.
Aw, it's soo unfair.
Patrick and I had such a great time last night! I mean I think this could maybe turn into something serious.
Chandler!! You have the best taste in men!
Well, like father, like son.
Really?! I-I thought you weren't looking for something serious? I thought you were looking for some kind of a fling.
Well, y'know, possibly. You didn't tell him that, though? Right?
You guys, you're never gonna believe what I just found tacked up on a telephone pole! Look kinda familiar?
We're not throwing it away! I built that canoe!
Good for you!!
Apparently Phoebe's mother also goes by the name Julio.
You guys, there's a little girl in Soho looking for this cat. I mean, you know what that means?!
Hello? Yes, she is, hold on a second, please. Monana, it's for you, the credit card people.
Okay Monica, what are you doing? You're gonna lose your job! This is not you!
No, it is me! Y'know, I'm not just the person who needs to fluff the pillows and pay the bills as soon as they come in! Y'know, when I'm with her, I am so much more than that. I'm- I'm Monana!
Helloooo? Yeah. Oh my God. Thanks.
What?
I have an extra ticket. An extra ticket. Not, two tickets, I have an extra ticket.
Yeah. Well, I think our second fight is going to be a big one!
Okay, for next time, what do you say?
So the first time you ask a guy out, he-he turns you down?
He didn't turn me down! He's at the game isn't he? I got the date, I'm just not on it!
No, there's a party. There's a party. But the power, that is still up for grabs. You follow me?
That's right! 'Cause that would give him the control! So now he's all ooh, coming up with this whole I've got a party thing y'know, trying to get me to hint around for an invitation. Blew up in his face, didn't it?
So-so there is no party.
I think so. Se, he-he's not inviting you to his party because he likes you.
Exactly.
Uhh, because I'm trying to play hard to get. Oh, quick he's looking over here, say something funny.
You really didn't know?
Why are you in here if Joshua is all the way over there?
Like what?
What-what-what is so funny?
Okay. All right, I see what he's doing! He's not asking me out, because he wants me to ask him out.
Okay, see ya.
Well, I guess we won't be warming his house.
And you're not gonna do that.
That's right! 'Cause that would give him the control! So now he's all ooh, coming up with this whole I've got a party thing y'know, trying to get me to hint around for an invitation. Blew up in his face, didn't it?
Oh thanks, but listen, I was just at Monica's and she and Chandler had a big fight and they're not moving in.
Hey!
Hey! Oh listen, I was just clearing some space for your stuff.
What do you mean, they're not moving in? They-they're still moving in right?
No-no, they just had a big blowout over what to do with my room.
They're my new 'I don't need a job, I don't need my parents, I've got great boots' boots!
You would be too if you found John and David boots on sale, fifty percent off!
Oh, how well you know me...
How'd you pay for them?
Uh, credit card.
And then Jean-Claude took me to that place Crossroads and that's where we hung out with Drew Barrymore.
Rachel if you, if you want to go out with him, you can. Sound like a big jerk to me but if that's what you want to do...
Jean-Claude she said yes, I'll see you tonight. Thank you.
Oh man, she's so smokin, she has got the greatest set of. . . no guys around, huh.
Does anybody need anything?
Ross, that was a Halloween costume, unless you would like me to go to this thing as Little Bo Peep.
Oh-ho, it'll be back. Oh-ho, there's nobody in the room.
Look, I'm sorry, I thought it looked pretty.
Look, I didn't recognize it without that inflatable sheep.
Yeah, which, by the way Chandler, I would like back one of these days.
Oh my God Phoebe! I mean I'm just-Wait a minute. If I'm your maid of honor that means you are Monica's.
Really?!
Uh-hmm.
Oh! Well, if that's what you want...
Ohh! No way Phoebe! I want to be Monica's!
Closure, that's what it is. Closure. Hello, excuse me. Excuse me, hel. . . woo
Yeah! Closure. That's what it is, that's what I need. God, you're brilliant! Why didn't I think of that? How do I get that?
Well, you know, there's no one way really, it's just, you know, whatever it takes so that you can finally say to him, "I'm over you."
Hang on.
Hello, excuse me.
No! Ross, no! It is not fine! Eh-eh-according to my plan I should already be with the guy I wanna marry!
No, so I don't have to get married until I'm 33! That's three years, that's three whole years-Oh, wait a minute though. I'll need a year and a half to plan the wedding, and I'd like to know the guy for a year, year and a half before we get engaged... Which means I need to meet the guy by the time I'm thirty.
Which is fine! Because you just turned--twenty-eight!
Will you quit hoggin' it!
I'm telling you it's like watching Bambi learn how to walk.
You would be too if you found John and David boots on sale, fifty percent off!
Are you kidding? I'm trained for nothing! I was laughed out of twelve interviews today.
And yet you're surprisingly upbeat.
Oh, how well you know me...
They're my new 'I don't need a job, I don't need my parents, I've got great boots' boots!
It wouldn't have mattered anyway, Phoebe, you and I are, are gonna live together, we're roommates; that's the deal.
Did you get all this stuff for Joey to try and drive me out of the apartment? Honey, if you wanted to do that, you might as well just gotten him a fish, you know how fish freaked me out!
Fish!
Yes, but I wanted you to want to live with me, but okay, if you're having so much fun over here...
Oh, it's so much more fun with you.
Yeah, but then you spent Phoebe's entire birthday party talking to my breasts, so then I figured maybe not.
Um... yeah. Well, I mean, when I first met you, y'know, I thought maybe, possibly, you might be...
You did?
Huh. Did, uh... any of the rest of you guys think that when you first met me?
I did.
She's totally right! When we were together, you got all freaked out about Mark and there was nothing going on.
Huh.
What?
This totally makes sense!
It does not!
What, no, no, no, mine are deceptively small I mean, I-I-I actually sometimes, st-stuff my bra.
Okay, Monica's are the biggest.
These tiny, little non-breasts?! Please, it's gotta be Rachel.
All right then, your bra would still be big.
No, I stuff outside the bra.
Remember?! We-come on both had the sarongs on, and we had the-the coconut bikini tops...
Anyway, speaking of drinking too much. I was uh, tellin' Phoebe about that one crazy night after the Sigma Chi luau where you and I uh, we made out.
What?
Yeah?
...we went back the house and we got really silly and we...we made out.
Oh, yeah, sure, sure, sure, sure. Listen, can we please have lunch the next time I'm in the city?
Yeah.
So, I'll get-get back to my friend.
Oh, that'd be great.
Okay!
Come on, this isn't funny. She thinks it's my fault that you haven't called her. You have to call her!
Why hasn't he called Rachel? Why? Why? I don't understand. Why? He said he'll call. Why? Why? Chandler I'm telling you she has flipped out, she's gone crazy!
Oh, well give me the phone then.
Look, you can't call somebody after this long just to say, 'In case you didn't notice, I don't like you!'
Well then you're going to have to take her out again.
Okay. Oh wait! One more thing umm, do-do we still need to uh settle the question of "us?"
Yes.
All right I guess I'm, gonna go pack.
Hey you guys wait! Guys! This place is so much better than London! Okay? This lady dressed like Cleopatra gave me a coupon, 99 cent steak and lobster dinner. Huh!
Phoebe, you don't eat animals.
Umm, okay, I think I'm-I'm just gonna-just gonna say it. Just gonna say it. Uhh, I'm still in love with you Ross.
Okay.
Go ahead.
Wow. Umm... Huh... I'm-I'm not sure what to do with that right now.
What? What? Was that a joke? 'Cause it's mean.
Yeah! I've been sailing my whole life. When I was fifteen my dad bought me my own boat.
Y'know Joey, I could teach you to sail if you want.
You could?
Your own boat?
What?! What?! He was trying to cheer me up! My pony was sick.
Yeah Pheebs, honey, she just got engaged a couple of hours ago. I doubt she's even had time to...
To Monica!
So have you decided on a band for the wedding? Because, y'know, I'm kinda musical.
Well speaking of chiming in, remember the time you burned down my apartment?
Yeah, you're on your own.
Yeah honey, I'm standing right there! Why didn't you just tell him about the mole I haven't got checked yet.
I'd love some juice. Thanks.
Okay. Wow! This is going so well. Did you see us? Did you see?
Excellent!
There will come a time in each of your careers when you'll have a chance to screw over another soap opera actor. I had such an opportunity in the recent, present. And I'm ashamed to say that I took it, I advised a fellow actor to play a role, homosexually. Yeah, we both auditioned for the part, and uh, as it turned out, they ah, they liked the stupid gay thing and cast him. And now, he's got a two year contract opposite Susan Luchhi, the first lady of daytime television, and me, me I'm stuck here teaching a bunch of people, most of whom are too ugly to even be on TV. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Thank you.
Ross, things aren't gonna be weird between us, right? I mean was that just the stupidest thing, me telling you that?
The thing is y'know, that you're married to Emily.
That is what the thing is.
No. No. No, I'm-I'm glad you did. Look, if nothing else, it's-it's always great when someone tells you they love you.
That's what I said! Thank you for being so nice.
No honey, it's okay! Listen, I'll got to Ross's and get the blender, you get all the margarita stuff ready.
Ohhhh. Honey, honey, honey, it's okay, it's okay honey. I'm gonna fix you a drink, huh? Maybe a margarita?
Ross has the blender! Ugh, everything's just falling apart!
All right, he's keys are in the drawer. Y'know what? I also need some cash.
Okay, you want me to stop at the ATM?
Oh yeah, really? Is it Ross? Yeah? Okay, well let me make this a just a little bit easier for you.
Ohh! Lucky me! Oh my God! That is good news, Ross! I think that's the best news I've heard since Le Poo died!
You have no idea what a nightmare this has been. This is so hard.
What are you doing?
Storming out!
Careful. Light. Okay, do you know how, just sweep it across the lid. Okay? Just sweep it.
Yeah.
All right.
Oke-dokey.
Oh-ho!
Oh my God, wait did I-I just said Greens don't quit didn't I? Did I just say Greens don't quit?!
Because you're not finished yet and I won't have it! Greens do not quit!
Greens? I'm a Tribbiani! And Tribbianis quit!
Yes! Yes! You did and you're still yelling at me!
No! No! No! I'm not yelling at you, I'm just yelling near you. Oh God Joey, ohh I'm my father. Oh my God, this is horrible! I've been trying so hard not to be my mother I did not see this comin'. Oh, Joey, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I just wanted you to learn.
Ok, Ross, try to hear me. Ok, I, hey, I'm not gonna lie to you. Ok, it was good with Paolo.
God, Ross, look, what you and I have is special, all Paolo and I ever had was...
Animal sex, animal sex? So what're you saying, I mean, you're saying that like, there's nothing between us animal at all. I mean there's not even like, uhm, a little animal, not even, not even like, like chipmunk sex?
Knock-knock.
But, what you and I have is so much better. Ok, we have tenderness, we have intimacy, we connect. Ya know, I swear, this is the best I have ever had.
Well then how come you're still at a job that you hate, I mean why don't you quit and get 'the fear'?
The fear?
He's right, if you quit this job, you then have motivation to go after a job you really want.
Because, I'm too afraid.
I don't know, I mean I would give anything to work for a designer, y'know, or a buyer.... Oh, I just don't want to be 30 and still work here.
Then, we had this big, stupid fight, and I said I wanted to take a break, I don't want to take a break.
Fine, you're right. Let's ah, let's take a break, let's cool off, okay, let's get some frozen yoghurt, or something..
No. A break from us.
I've been thinking, this is crazy, I mean don't, don't you think we can work on this?
Hey, what do you want to drink?
Yeah, what're you saying, you just sort of put away feelings or whatever the hell it was you felt for me?
Hey, there was one Italian guy, OK, and do you even have a point?
The point is I... I don't need this right now, OK. It, it's too late, I'm with somebody else, I'm happy. This ship has sailed.
Hey, I've been doin' it since the ninth grade, I've gotten pretty damn good at it.
Alright, fine, you go ahead and you do that, alright Ross.
Ohh Tag, umm...you're such a great guy and we have sooo much fun together but I don't-I don't...
Umm...
What's up?
Wait! I think I see where you're going, but before you say anything else, can I just say one more thing?
Well said. And a uh good example of the fun I was referring to uhh, but I just think I'm past the point where I think I can y'know, just have fun.
Okay. Switch places with me! Switch places with me! Come on! I'll go under, you go over!
Hello darlings.
And there's daddy!
Yeah, I'll get right on that.
Oh come on Ross!!
OK, here we go. Honey, I'm sorry, they were all out of apple pie, someone just got the last piece.
Yeah.
Never call me from that phone.
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God. You are not gonna believe this. I have just been discovered.
Now wait a minute, I claimed you in the name of France four years ago.
Okay, remember uh, remember how you told me that your grandmother put up that wall to make that into two bedrooms?
Oh my God!
What?
Yeah?
And remember how you always said you were afraid the landlord would find out and then tear it down?
Yeah, it's kinda like a 'good luck on your first day' sort of thing. Is this actually a lunchbox?
Oh honey, thank you, but Mark's taking me out.
Mark is that ah, the same Mark that helped you get the job?
Umm, no, it's a purse. And there's a thermos in it.
Oh.
So-so, you missed a message from who? Chandler or your mom? Or Chandler? Or your mom?
You get your messages!
Yeah, well I don't think it really counts if you have to read them off the back of your hand after you fall asleep on the couch.
Great! It worked! No one's sad.
Yes! I win again! Ha-ha! That's like 500 bucks you owe me! Whoo-ho-hoo! $500 that is a loooot of electricity! Whoo-ho-ho! I gotta buy some food.
Oh, okay, well, I think we should let Phoebe decide, because she's the only who's impartial, and she's so pretty.
All right!
Ooh, this is so exciting! Ooh, God, what are you going to bet?
Okay. Umm, ooh, ooh-oh, I have a game!
Okay!
Okay, you know what? You're going to have to call that plane and tell them to swing around and come and pick me up.
Hello. I need to get on the 11 o'clock flight.
Oh I'm afraid that plane has already pulled away from the gate.
I can't do that.
Sure, you know what? Come on, we'll just tell them that there was like a problem with like the "engine".
Oh... I'm sorry. I... I-I don't mean-I didn't mean to stifle you. I... This is all just a little overwhelming.
I don't care about the little dude! I can't! I cannot listen to anymore of this! Y'know, the only person who would want to listen to this is a mental health professional! And then it's only because they get paid $100 an hour! Do you know how much money I could've made listening to you? $2,000! And do you know when I figured that out? While you were talking!
What?! I can't believe you're trying to stifle me! When just 14 hours ago we figured out that that is exactly what my mother was trying to do to me!
Oh Rachel, I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to overwhelm you. It's just that, when those gates open, you... Hard to close 'em. But they are closed now. Believe me.
I'm so glad, I'm so glad you shared. And I'm glad that you're done. What do you say we umm...
And remember how I said I was going to keep it in my purse so that if it rang I could just pick it up?
Umm Pheebs, remember when we were in the coffee house we decided that I was going to keep the uh, the cute guy's cell phone?
Yeah.
Yeah!
And do you remember going into my purse and stealing the phone?!
Yeah! Wait a minute, it's been a long time that I've been single. How come you never offered this before?
Well, I know what I'm giving you for Christmas.
Y'know what? There's some nice guys at my office, do you want me to set you up?
Well, I have a girlfriend, I'm-I'm happy. So, I no longer feel the need to go out of my way to stop others from being happy.
Okay! No accountants. Oh, and no one from like legal. I don't like guys with boring jobs.
Well, y'know, the reason I didn't wanna go running with you is because um, well y'know the way that you run is a little...
Well, I-I should've told you the truth.
Uh-Huh, Which is...?
So?
Well, it's embarrassing. People were looking at us like we were crazy.
Okay, look, Ross, I realise that my Father is difficult, but that's why you have got to be the bigger man here.
All right, look, here's the bottom line Ross, this is fixable, if we act fast, okay. So, I'll invite him to brunch tomorrow and you can make nice.
Look, honey, I have tried to make nice, it doesn't work.
Look sweetie, I could be the bigger man, I could be the biggest man, I could be a big, huge, giant man, and it still wouldn't make any difference, except that I could pick your Father up and say 'Like me! Like me tiny doctor!'
Okay, well can't you just try it one more time Ross? For me? For me?
Honey, this is not your fault, just because you guys had a fight, it does not justify her sleeping with someone.
How? How is your fault?
Because, I-I should've called! Y'know if I had just called her after our big, stupid fight, she never would've gone out with Nick, and they would've ended up in bed together. I threw her at his man nipples!
Well, if-if she thought they were on a break...
Rachel, one of your customers seems to have left his billfold. A Joshua Bergen.
Y'know, I-I gotta tell ya, those eye drops are a miracle. My eye is a 100% better.
Very good Monica! You know where they are.
I sure do! And you don't get one!
They're still in my coat.
Damn!
Okay Phoebe calm down, there's no need to place blame. Okay? I warned her about those candles.
No-no-no, do you uh light candles? Burn incense?
Yes! I do! All the time! I love them! Oh my God! I did it! It's me! It's me! I burned down the house! I burned down the house!
God, it's great to catch up! I can't believe how long it's been!
Chandler, is that...
Right. So, what you have to do is, you have to accidentally run into her on purpose. And then act aloof.
This is a very critical time right now. If you feel yourself reaching for that phone, then you go shoe shopping, you get your butt in a bubble bath. You want her back you have to start acting aloof.
She has to know that your not ready.
So I'm not, not gonna lose her?
Oooh, honey, you're not a total loser.
Hey! Hey, Pheebs, check it out. Yeah, for my desert, I have chosen to make a traditional English truffle!
Hey!
Hey!
Wow, that sounds great! And what are you making Monica, in case Rachel's dessert is... so good that I eat all of it. There's none left for anybody else!
Nothing.
Hey, do you guys know what you're doing for New Year's? Gee, what?! What is wrong with New Year's?
So what are you gonna be?
Ah, I'm gonna be one of his helpers. It's just such a slap in the face, y'know?
Nothing for you, you have Paolo. You don't have to face the horrible pressures of this holiday: desperate scramble to find anything with lips just so you can have someone to kiss when the ball drops!! Man, I'm talking loud!
Well, for your information, Paolo is gonna be in Rome this New Year, so I'll be just as pathetic as the rest of you.
Monica, number one, I don't think Ben understands the concept of bribery, and number two, I... What?!
Okay. If you're alive you answer your phone!
Okay, Ben, I won't tell your daddy that you had ice cream for dinner, if you don't tell about our little bonking incident.
You said number two.
I also said number one.
I uh, I have two tickets to the Knicks game tonight if you're interested, just as a thank you for this week.
Basketball!
I'm sorry.
Wow! That would be great.
Really?
Oh my God! Oh my God!! That is like the third most prestigious soap opera award there is!
Honey? Is that something you're making up?
No, no, no! It's real! And it has been since 1998. Hey Rach! Rach! I'm up for a Soapie!
Thank you! Well, I guess now I know who I'm taking to the awards.
Oh, stop that! Don't kid about that! Will all the stars be there?
Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight with you Ross! Look, urrgh, maybe we should take a break.
Oh my God.
Okay, it's not, it's not.
Fine, you're right. Let's ah, let's take a break, let's cool off, okay, let's get some frozen yoghurt, or something..
No. A break from us.
Really?! Okay well then, all right, well just have a seat there. Umm, so what's-what is-what's your name?
Wow! H-umm! Hi! Yes, uh I'm sorry the models are actually down the hall.
Actually, I'm here about the assistant job.
Tag Jones.
Uh-huh, go on.
Oh, wait Joey! We fought the Nazis in World War II, not World War I.
Oh. Well then way to go you big movie star!
I know! All right, I'll see you guys over there! I'm off to fight the Nazis.
Whoa! Okay. Yeah well, who-who was in World War I?
Go ahead.
You'd be okay if you knew that Mark had kissed me, and been naked with me, and made love to me?
All right. Let's say I had slept with Mark. Would you have been able to forgive me?
Yes I would.
Yes.
You knew that our hot, sweaty, writhing bodies were....
I mean y'know, I'm thinking. You could bring her, and you guys could go up to your old room, and not make out.
Well where's Amanda?
Hey Rach, could you get me some cough drops?
Ross, cough drops, please?
At least I know she's not going out with me to get into R rated movies.
Ugh, the worse day! Y'know, you think you're making progress at work and then your boss calls you Raquel.
Hey!
Hey.
Hey listen, for the first four years of my work everybody called me Sha-la-lap. Seriously.
I believe you. So, it was right in the middle of a staff meeting so of course no one else wants to correct her so everyone else is calling me Raquel! By the end of the day, the mailroom guys were calling me Rocky!
Wait, we still have time to talk and they're-they're not even in the car yet! Oh look, there they go, okay.
Okay, that's gonna take them a minute. Do you have anything else you wanna get off your chest?
I can't believe this!
Okay Phoebe, we should probably go back now.
Please don't leave me, I'll be lonely.
Yeah and honey I promise next time that I will just say good-bye and tell 'em you're not looking for a relationship.
No hey Rach, it's cool okay? Y'know I'm a loner too! Right?
Hey Joey, y'know what? You are way to good for her.
No! No. Don't do that, just next time make sure she really likes me.
Well that too. Joey?
But see, it was a plan. Y'know, it was clear. It was figured out, and now everything's just kinda like...
Okay, but Pheebs, Pheebs, Jack gave up a cow, I gave up an orthodontist. Okay, I-I-I know, I know I didn't love him-
Oh, see, Jack did love the cow.
Floopy?
Yeah.
Y'know what? Fine, I don't care. Don't believe me, I know I'm right-do you guys want to go downstairs and get a drink?
If anybody asks, I'm your sister, Joan. Listen. C'mon, you guys. Ross said my name up there that obviously means that he still loves me!
Your sister Joan is crazy.
Yes, we do. But, we have to change first.
Yes, I want to change. And why-why don't you go down and get us a table?
I did but she doesn't think anyone would be stupid enough to confuse Kenny the copy guy with Ralph Lauren.
Now, she thinks that I made out with him and I did it to get her job.
But why didn't you just tell her the truth.
Well, hey, what if Kenny were the real brains behind the whole company? You know. What if Kenny hired that Ralph Lauren guy to be the pretty front man? Huh, did she ever think of that?
You were with Kenny today, weren't you?
When she sees that you're gone, she's gonna know that I let you out, and that I was in here, and I'm gonna get fired!
Wait a minute! What are you gonna tell Joanna?
About what?
I'll make something up! I'm good at lying, I actually did borrow your Walkman!
No, there's nothing to make up, she's gonna know that I have a key to her office, I've got to get you locked up back the way you were!
Come on Ross give me the keys! Monica does not know what she's talking about! I am an excellent driver!
Take the top down did ya?
Only way to fly.
You're fast and irresponsible. That adds up to a bad driver.
Well in High School, that added up to head cheerleader.
Well not when they find out you slept with Jason Hurley an hour after he broke up with Monica.
Only 'cause you took up half the circle.
Listen to you two. It's so sad. Looks like I'm gonna be going to the goddess meetings alone.
One hour? You are such a leaf blower.
Oh hey uh, be careful with that 3-D last supper, Judas is a little loose.
Wait, wait, Chandler, this is what you're havin' for Thanksgiving dinner? What, what, what is it with you and this holiday?
Thank you. Thank you so much!
Chandler, here you go, got your traditional Thanksgiving feast, you got your tomato soup, your grilled cheese fixin's, and your family size bag of Funyuns.
All right, I'm nine years old.
Oh, I hate this story.
Oh, well, I guess I had that one coming. I'm just gonna throw it out, it's probably just a bunch of shampoo and...
Oh, great. Although I did sit down where there wasn't a chair.
By the way, Ross dropped by a box of your stuff.
Something wrong?
No. Nothing.
Yeah, well, it's an important day. I wanna look nice. Um, has uh Dr. Franzblau been by?
Hey. Ooh, look at you, dressy-dress.
Did you go home and change?
No, I haven't seen him.
Well, where is he? He is supposed to be here. What if the baby needs him?
Monica, your dad just beeped in, but can you make it quick? Talking to Rome. I'm talking to Rome.
Oh my God! Calling from Rome! Bon giorno, caro mio.
So he's calling from Rome. I could do that. Just gotta go to Rome.
Hey dad, what's up? Oh God. Ross, it's Nana.
So, uh, how's she doing?
Okay. God y'know, if someone told me a week ago that I would be peeing in Joey Tribbiani's apartment...
Umm, can I use your bathroom?
It's uh, right through there.
Yeah, life's pretty great isn't it?
Yeah, it sure is!
Look, this is not that big of a deal! You just don't date Ross! There's a million other guys out there, you just...
Y'know Bob in Human Resources...
Ugh! I cannot believe you did this too me! You had me doubting how smart I was! You had me doubting my fashion sense!
Hey! You have no right to tell me what to do.
I'm not telling you what to do! I am telling you what not to do!
Okay, but if it only happened that one time, how come we found your underwear in our apartment the other day?
Of course it's true! How else would you explain all the weird stuff that's been going on?
Yes it's true.
Ahh-oy! That was the underwear I was wearing that night in London. Right Monica?
I guess I wanted to keep it as a souvenir.
Well maybe she and her friends are just having a contest to see who can bring home the biggest geek.
Okay, but that's, like, the easiest era.
I've seen her at work, but I always figured, ah-huh? But, uh, I made her dinner. We had a great time. And we're going out again tomorrow.
Fine by me; hope she wins.
Hi. You guys have any wrapping paper?
Well, we were walking down the street and we saw that van that you guys used for catering and we realised...
Ooh-Ooh! I did it! I did it! I figured out a way to make money! I'm gonna open up my own massage place and Frank's gonna help me! And! We can work it around his schedule so he doesn't have to quit school!
That's sounds great, but how are you going to afford it?
I'm telling it! I'm telling it!
Okay.
Yeah. Oh I just wish we could not be married for a little bit! Y'know I just wish we could be like on a break!
Ohh! And I'm one of them!! Wow! Oh, I just cannot believe this! I mean, Joey Tribbiani!
Well, y'know it's none of my business, but aren't you married?
Well, you're not.
Oh, it's so easy for you I mean, you're not married, you get to have sex with who ever you want!
And hey! Just so you know, it's not that common! It doesn't happen to every guy! And it is a big deal!!
Sorry!! I just feel bad about all that sleep you're gonna miss wishing you were with me!
Oh, no-no-no don't you worry about me falling asleep. I still have your letter!!!
I KNEW IT!!!!
Gin.
Ok, I'm sorry, I'm just not very good with babies. I mean I haven't been around them, I mean, you know, since I was one.
This is how I would hold a football.
Ok, here, here. There we go.
It's alright, it's no big deal.
Really?
Yeah, it'll be fun. We'll run in the park. It'll be like our first y'know roommate bonding thing.
Phoebe, come on can we finish this later? Cause I wanna go running before it gets dark. Oh! Why don't you come with me?!
Really?
Okay, let's go running!
Yeah and there's really cute guys there.
All right, you know what, that's fine. If you guys want to be children about this, that's fine. I do not need to see it.
All right, you know what? This isn't funny anymore. There's something about me on that piece of paper and I want to see it.
No, you don't.
What is this? Ross, what is this?
Good luck.
Yes, yes it is true. And I know this because, because he pretended to be Drake to, to sleep with me.
That's right, he's not Drake, he's Hans Remore, Drake's evil twin.
Is this true?
And then he told me he would run away with me, and he didn't.
And you left the toilet seat up, you bastard.
Oh! I see. And I've sort of been maintaining my amateur status so that I can waitress in the Olympics.
But, but?
But, you see, it's just... this night has to go just perfect, you know? And, well, Wendy's more of a... professional waitress.
You know, I don't mean to brag, but I waited tables at Innsbruck in '76. Amouz-bouche?
Talk to me.
Oh! Y'know what? You're right! We meet, you flirted and then bamn nine years later you had me!
But y'know, I never really had anything to worry about. Ross was never very good at the flirting thing.
What? What-what, what are talking about? It-it worked with you.
All right, all right. You-you-you know what I'm going to do? I am going to order another pizza and when Caitlin gets here, you-you--I will show how well I flirt. Yeah! I will, I will get her phone number! And not the one on the menu!
I found it!
Hey-hey-hey that's funny! Your funny Chandler! Your a funny guy! You wanna know what else is really funny?!
Well you sure used a large font.
Eh, yeah, well ah, waitress at a coffee shop and cheer squad co-captain only took up so much room.
Something else I might have said?
I don't know, I don't know, weren't you the guy that told me to quit my job when I had absolutely nothing else to do. Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!!
Oh, by the way Mon, I don't think the mailman liked your cookies. Here are the ornaments your mom sent.
You guys haven't gotten your presents yet? Tomorrow's Christmas Eve, what're ya gonna do?
Don't you have to be Claymation to say stuff like that?
Well, maybe the mailman liked the cookies, we just didn't give him enough.
Monica, pigeons learn faster that you.
No-no! Big bear! Big bear outside! I think I-I-would you-actually, would you go check on that?
I feel like we're the only two people in the world. Oops. Sorry.
What's the matter honey? Did you see a little mouse?
Honey, we don't have any bears here.
Well, okay. Would-would you get me a Diet Coke?
Ohh! Phoebe, this is all your fault! Now he loves her, he's gonna marry her, and this is all your fault.
Come on Phoebe, look at that! They are not breaking up, look at them. Okay that's, you know what that is? That is a, that is a second date, that's what that is! Look at that, she just put her hand on his thigh...
Oh no! That really is nothing, she is very sexually aggressive.
You said it was okay!
You said she was bald!!
Ohhhh. Honey, honey, honey, it's okay, it's okay honey. I'm gonna fix you a drink, huh? Maybe a margarita?
Oops. Sorry! Well, good thing you number all of them, huh?
I hadn't! Photo 152 was a prototype.
Ross has the blender! Ugh, everything's just falling apart!
No honey, it's okay! Listen, I'll got to Ross's and get the blender, you get all the margarita stuff ready.
Oh Joey, I'm sorry I just couldn't tell her all those things you wanted me to tell her. And y'know we got to talking and I...
Bye!
So, system kinda broke down huh?!
We want you to marry her!
What?!!
Well, at first it was really intense, you know. And then, oh, god, and then we just sort of sunk into it.
Do not start without me. Do not start without me.
Ok, all right, let's hear about the kiss. Was it like, was it like a soft brush against your lips? Or was it like a, you know, a "I gotta have you now" kind of thing?
Ok, so, ok, was he holding you? Or was his hand like on your back?
No, actually first they started on my waist. And then, they slid up, and then, they were in my hair.
Excuse me, I wanted you to help, but you couldn't move your arms because you were wearing three life jackets.
Well, lesson learned! Rachel is mean!
Yeeeeeep... Yep-yep-yep-yep-yep. I remember when she took out on her dad's boat she wouldn't let me help at all.
You have to respect the sea!
Look Joey, I'm sorry if-if you thought that was mean, but I gotta tell ya something. That was not mean. Okay, my father is mean. He used to yell at me all the time on the boat, I mean it was horrible. I was just being a good teacher.
Oh, please, Monica. You've always hated my lamp, and then, all of a sudden, it's just magically broken?
I am. Let me just get my coat.
Ok, all right. It was an accident, I swear, all right. I was putting on my jacket, and the thing, and the lamp, and it broke.
Phoebe, tell her!
Ok, I didn't see it, because I was putting on my jacket, but I uh want to believe you.
I didn't have to, because I was wearing my 'I heart Ross' sandwich board and ringing my bell.
No, only for sex.
Thank you. So did you ah, did you tell Mark Something about me?
Uh-huh.
Joey!!! Happy Birthday!!
So what are you saying; I should run him under hot water and bang his head against a table?
Good. Although y'know, he-he's a private guy. Y'know, I wish I could get him to open up a little bit, share some feelings.
That's easy! You just have to think of him as a-as a jar of pickles that won't open.
No that's what you do when you want to get the truth out of someone.
Hi honey.
Phoebe, his music could not get any worse. There are rats in the basement that are hanging themselves.
Oh my God, he's lost it. He's totally lost it.
What?
Thank you, thanks. Yeah, I lost it. Y'know, I'm not gonna play anymore, would you, can you finish my set?
After that? Yeah! No, I mean if I can help.
Hi, I'm sorry I'm late but I am ready, ready to talk you up! When does Liz's father get here?
Okay here we are Paul, Elizabeth. So I hope you guys were finding something to talk about.
Yes, we were just...
I'm already here.
Oh! Ross is sooo great!
Ross, you have planned out the next 20 years of our lives, we've been dating for six weeks.
I don't know, you tell me. One minute I'm holding Ben like a football, the next thing I know, I've got two kids, I'm living in Scarsdale complaining about the taxes.
Well I'm sorry, I think about stuff. Ya know, I mean, you're at work, you're assembling bones, your mind wanders.
C'mon, what, you never think about our future?
Yes, but I, I think about who's apartment we're gonna sleep at tomorrow night and, and where we're gonna have dinner next Saturday night. I do not think about what our childrens' names are gonna be. You know what our childrens names are gonna be.
Please. If she said to you, "Ross, I want you on this couch, right here, right now," what would you say?
I don't know! I mean, we still care about each other. There's a history there. 'S'like you and Carol.
No! No no, it is nothing like me and Carol!
If it helps, I could slide over.
It's, it's, it's, uh, a totally diferent situation! It's, it's apples and oranges, it's, it's orthodontists and lesbi- I gotta go.
No, actually first they started on my waist. And then, they slid up, and then, they were in my hair.
Well, at first it was really intense, you know. And then, oh, god, and then we just sort of sunk into it.
Ok, so, ok, was he holding you? Or was his hand like on your back?
Ohhhh.
And, uh, and then I kissed her.
Of course I packed! Monica relax! I just wanted to ask Phoebe her opinion on what I should wear tonight.
Well and clearly not a minute sooner.
Rachel, you are packed though right, I mean please tell me that you're packed.
My God, I can't get a minute of peace around this place.
Oh my God! Monica's just gonna kill you.
Monica, would you calm down? The credit card people said that you only have to pay for the stuff that you bought.
How could someone get a hold of your credit card number?
I have no idea. But look how much they spent!
I know. It's just such reckless spending.
I think when someone steals your credit card, they've kind of already thrown caution to the wind.
Monica, this is Dan , one of the guys that we're gonna be going out with on Saturday. Uh Dan, Monica.
Hi!
Rachel.
Nice to meet you.
Hello Dan! I'm really looking forward to Saturday night! Really, really!
Yeah. And y'know who should've shut their drapes? Is that perverted old couple two doors over.
I'm good.
Oh, are the drapes still closed hon?
Is that a swing?
Oh don't even ask!
And Chandler, you're gonna have to watch those long showers you take in the morning because you know Raquel can't be late.
And that was so sweet of you to ask! Oh my God, the three of us are gonna have such a good time living together!
Yes, we are.
Rach...
Yeah, he's gonna work on that.
Oh wow, eight hours? So you could probably really use one of those plug-in telephone headsets huh?
So are things with you and Joey any better?
They couldn't be worse. I spent eight hours calling him last night, just trying to get him to talk to me.
Should we all expect Christmas gifts that can be stolen from your office?
You shouldn't.
I'm not gonna tell you, but if you found out on your own, that would be okay and then we could talk about it. Right?
Remember that big thing I was gonna tell you about?
Oh, no!
Well, then it wouldn't be a secret. So yeah, that would be okay. Yeah. Yeah!
Yeah. Well. Hey uh Joe, would mind going over to Chandler's bedroom and get that book back that he borrowed from me?
But don't you think Rosita would've wanted you to move on? I mean y'know, she did always put...your comfort first.
Okay, come on-Joey, I'll buy you a new one! All right? We'll go down to the store right now and we'll-we'll get you a new chair.
She's not even cold yet!
That's true.
Okay? You ready?
Okay, okay, okay, look, just don't freak out, but I kinda lost it. I know it's in the apartment, but I definitely lost it.
Oh what, you-you want both of them?
Rachel Karen Green, where's the other earring?!
Well, what am I going to tell Monica? She wants to wear them tonight!
Tell her to wear her own earrings.
Oh Ross you're so tense! You just gotta relax okay? Just need to relax all right? Just need to relax...
God. I forgot how much I love driving. I have got to get my license renewed.
You don't have a valid driver's license-Okay that is it! Pull over right now!
What-what are you doing?! Are you-Okay that's not funny! Just stop horsing around!
I am not horsing around okay? I am Porsching around.
Oh. Listen, I'm so sorry. I would, I would've never fogged you if y'know if you hadn't looked so.... Y'know.
What? Yeti-I mean Danny?
I had to cut my hair to get rid of the uh, fogger smell.
Absolutely. Some people are just into appearances.
What?
All right, you know what? This isn't funny anymore. There's something about me on that piece of paper and I want to see it.
Alright. "It was summer, and it was hot. Rachel was there. A lonely gray couch. 'Oh, look,' cried Ned, and then the kingdom was his forever. The end."
That's it? That's all you wrote? You're the worst writer in the whole world.
No, you don't.
All right, you know what, that's fine. If you guys want to be children about this, that's fine. I do not need to see it.
Hi. Hey, hi! So uh, Frank and Alice wanted me to tell you that they're still outside making phone calls.
Which one do you have?
I don't care.
But umm, I mean, did you talk to them about, y'know...
Yeah, umm, no honey.
Ross! Come on! That's all right! Fine--Okay, I have a weird thing about my eye. Can we not talk about it please?
What?
Anytime anything comes close to touching her eye or anyone else's she like freaks out. Watch! Watch!
All right, fine.
Hey Rach, remember that great song, Me, Myself, and I?
Okay. Ah, well we'll just see about that, okay. I will read The Shining, and you will read Little Women.
Well, umm, I guess I read Little Women more than once. But I mean that's a classic, what's so great about The Shining?
The question should be Rach, what is not so great about the shining. Okay? And the answer would be nothing. All right? This is like the scariest book ever. I bet it's way better than that classic of yours.
All right, you got it.
All right.
Well, I just lost a job, and I'd like to raise the bet five bucks. Does anybody have a problem with that?
I see your fifty cents... and I raise you... five dollars.
I thought, uh... it was a fifty cent limit.
: Loser?
No, I fold.
Jill this is not about me being jealous of you! This is about you being a brat! Wanting what you can't have!
I'm not telling you what to do! I am telling you what not to do!
Why are you so jealous of me?
Can't have?! Excuse me, the only thing I can't have is dairy!
All right, all right, well you just blew your chances at dating Bob!
Ow ow ow. Ow ow ow ow. Ow ow ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow.
Im okay! Im okay! Mr. Heckles, Mr. Heckles could you help me please?
See, this is just the kind of thing I was talking about.
Hi. Uh, my friend here was taking down our Christmas lights, and and she fell off the balcony and may have broken her foot or or ankle or something.
My god. You still have your Christmas lights up?
Oh no, yes I do! I do! I mean, come on go on, you were, you were saying I am happier when uh, y'know?
Wow! I did not see that coming.
It's just not really who I am. Y'know, I've always been happier when...Why am I telling you this? You don't care about this stuff.
When I'm in a relationship, I love having a girlfriend.
Really?
Okay, see, see, you guys, what if we don't get magic beans? I mean, what if all we've got are.. beans?
...Pheebs?
Oh, well... 'cause.... you just... I don't like this question.
Get him! GET HIM! Get him! Get- YESSS! Not laughing now, are ya pal!
See buddy, that's all you need, a bunch of toothless guys hitting each other with sticks.
Oh, you're one of those. But y'know what? I have two sisters of my own and we just-just tortured each other.
Fifty-two minutes. So no-no brothers and sisters, huh? That must be nice. You don't have to share stuff.
Sharing is good.
Really? Like how?
Well y'know, we would umm, repeat everything the other said, or uh, we'd jump out of closets to scare each other, or switch the sugar for the salt so they'd put salt on their cereal.
Agh, what a jerk. I kept talking about you and he kept asking me out. I mean, naturally, you know, I said no.
No one was around to hear that?
So what'd he say?
Well, thanks anyway.
He just kept asking, and asking, and asking, and asking, and asking, and asking.
Cats, how long do they live figuring you don't... y'know, throw 'em under a bus or something?
How long do cats live?
I'm sorry?
Um, maybe 15, 16 years.
That's just great.
Yes, yes, it does. Okay, look, the restaurant called, they wanna know if you're gonna be showing up for work?
Monica? Monica!
Water rules!
Nope. Going to the Big Apple Circus today.
Okay Monica, what are you doing? You're gonna lose your job! This is not you!
I'm not vanilla! I've done lots of crazy things! I mean I got-I got drunk and married in Vegas!
Vanilla?!
Yeah.
To Ross.
All right, y'know what? If you don't want to believe me about this, why don't you just come with me to dinner tonight and she will tell you.
And that was so sweet of you to ask! Oh my God, the three of us are gonna have such a good time living together!
Oh my God! That's so great! I'm so happy for you guys!
Really?!
Yes, we are.
And Chandler, you're gonna have to watch those long showers you take in the morning because you know Raquel can't be late.
God, I'm not lame, okay. I can do something. I can throw, would you let me throw, come on this is my game too.
No! Come on! Don't make me go long. Use me. They never cover me.
Honey, there's a reason.
Come on Mon, let her throw the ball.
All right Rachel, you sweep behind, I'll pitch it to you, you throw it down field to Phoebe. All right. Break.
That's crazy! You can't do that! What are you going to tell her? Oh God. Ohh, you already agreed to this, haven't you?
Yeah?
...is for me not to see you anymore.
It's awful I know, I mean, I feel terrible but I have to do this if I want my marriage to work. And I do, I have to make this marriage work. I have too. But the good thing is we can still see each other until she gets here.
Ohh! Lucky me! Oh my God! That is good news, Ross! I think that's the best news I've heard since Le Poo died!
I don't know, I mean, this is just my initial gut feeling... but I'm thinking... oh, I'm thinking it'd be really great.
I don't know. I don't know... I thought about it all the way there, and I thought about it all the way back... and, uh, oh, you guys, y'know, it's Ross. Y'know what I mean? I mean, it's Ross.
Sure.
Oh my God, me too! Oh! Oh, we'd be like friends-in-law! Y'know what the best part is? The best part is that you already know everything about him! I mean, it's like starting on the fifteenth date!
Yeah, but, y'know, it's... it would be like starting on the fifteenth date.
Anyway, there's this big charity ball this weekend and Ralph Lauren bought a table, so I kinda have to go...
Well, of course I do! My good friend Joey over here.
Oh, I'm sorry. Thank you Chandler.
What's the charity?
I don't know, something either trees or disease-Ralph mumbles a lot.
You don't tell a guy that you're looking for a serious relationship! You don't tell the guy that! Now you scared him away!
You idiot!!
I'm sure you're right, but why?
Oh, man. I'm sorry, I'm so-so sorry.
Y'know, you should never be allowed to talk to people!
Yeah! Oh, umm when-when Monica and Chandler got engaged I started putting some stuff together, y'know just in case...
Yeah. Yeah, and y'know you-you deserve to win. And-and y'know I was thinking about it, if-if you're Monica's maid of honor that means I get to be yours.
Oh yeah!
Oh that's so sweet thanks.
Here is a book of poetry that I know Monica loves. And-and ohh God this is funny, look, this is a picture of one Halloween where she dressed up as a bride. And look, she made me carry her train, which was weird because I was Wonder Woman. Oh and here's a little purse that I found. Y'know I just thought that maybe they could hold the rings in there.
When?! After the birth of our first secret child?! Ross didn't get the annulment; we are still married.
I cannot believe that you didn't tell me that we are still married!!
Look I was going to tell you!
What?
You're kidding!
Yeah, I do. I think you should go, by yourself, get some distance, clear your head, I think it'd be really good.
No, you know what, I think you should go.
What?
Oh, I don't, I don't, I don't know...
Oh, come on Ross! I think it would be really good for you!
Oh no! Yes! Of course, I know that! I just-I meant y'know are you still a 'We' or are you just 'You?'
Oh. We?
Well yeah, it usually, it takes two people to...
I'm just me, my wife died shortly after Lizzie was born.
Ohh. So you raised her all on your own?
Oh! Hi you guys, oh my God! You'll never gonna believe happened to me today! I am sitting in my office and...
Phoebe, do you think that your favorite animal says much about you?
What? You mean behind my back?
You guys! You guys! You're not gonna believe what my agent just told me!
Joey! Kinda in the middle of a story here!
What? Oh, well then y'know what? I think Monica would be very interested to know that you called her cheesecake dry and mealy.
You think I trust you with it?! No! We're gonna split it! You take half and I take half!
Well that's not fair, you've already had some!
What do we use to split it?
Okay! All right, pick a half.
Not stupid. The very cute, cute, cute doctors asked us out for tomorrow night, and I said "yes."
..so, he said it was just a sprain, and that was it.
Uh, you left out the stupid part.
I think it's totally insane, I mean, they work for the hospital. It's like returning to the scene of the crime. You know, I say we blow off the dates.
What? Monica, they are cute, they are doctors, cute doctors, doctors who are cute!
Okay. Okay. All right, you take care of that. And meanwhile, the party is tomorrow and we still don't have a guest list.
Well I'm not sure yet, but umm of the top of my head I'm thinking double sided tape and some sort of luncheon meat.
Hey! I've got a great idea for party favors for the shower. Okay, we get some uh mahogany boxes and carve everyone's names in them and inside is everyone's individual birth stone.
Okay. Okay! Well okay, who do we know that's coming? Me. Are you?
Hey!
Oh no-no-no-no-no, I'm still waiting to hear from that job and the store closes at nine, so you can eat then.
I want to go to the bathroom.
Alright, well, I'm gonna order a pizza.
That's fine. I'll just have a Tic-Tac to hold me over.
Alright, Cincinnati, no blinds, everybody ante.
Gone! I mean its amazing Pheebs. I feel so free and so graceful. Hey! Look out for the horse! Sorry!
Oh honey, I'm so sorry, you were right, this feels great!
See? And you don't care if people are staring, it's just for a second cause then you're gone!
Is it okay for me to come in now?
Uh-huh
Yeah-but come on-Listen, I'm sorry I don't want to make you uncomfortable, but I told Phoebe that it happened and she doesn't believe me.
Wh... Come on! Remember? We were on the sleeping porch! We couldn't stop giggling? And our coconuts kept knockin' together?
Oh, somewhere Joey's head is exploding.
I'm sorry Ray-ray. I mean if I thought it happened I would say it. Maybe I passed out and you did stuff to me while I was sleeping.
No!!
Nooo! Hello? Oh, yeah, no, I know, I-I haven't been using it much. Oh, well, thanks, but, I'm okay, really.
Oh, okay. Will you take my place?
Alright. Yes, this is Rachel.
Green. To the green.
I've got magic beans. Never-never mind.
Honey, y'know I just gotta tell you, I think this is such a terrific thing you're having these babies for Frank and Alice.
Happy birthday!
Just-just to clarify, I'm not Fonzie.
I know, it is.
Yeah!
Oh please, I hate packing, it's closer to work, and we do have fun. Although, I'm really gonna miss living with you.
Phoebe, it's okay. I like living with Joey.
Are you sure?
Oh me too.
I know. Oh-oh, wait did you hear that-hear that? Listen, I'm gettin' something from your grandmother, she said that since you get to keep the one bedroom apartment you should give Rachel the purple chair?
Yes, it bothers me Ross, but y'know if he was a regular at the coffee house, I'd be serving him sneezers.
Yeah. That's Daddy.
That's Daddy?! But doesn't it bother you? You're a waitress.
So?
So. Ross, I've bugged him about this a million times, he's not gonna change.
Well this has story behind it! I mean they had to ship it all the way from the White Plains store.
Phoebe hates Pottery Barn?!
Yeah, she hates all mass produced stuff. She thinks her furniture should have a history, a story behind it.
It's gotta be one of a kind. Y'know like umm, y'know uh, what's that God awful ceramic fruit bowl she has on her counter?
Hey! I made that for her!
Ohh. Oh, so you really wanted to learn. Yeah, y'know, Pheebs I just wanted to have fun. Ohh, you know who you should go with?
Phoebe, come on! What is the big deal? I thought this was going to be something we could do together! Y'know, I thought it would be fun!
Well, yeah! Fun is good, but y'know I also wanted to learn. Y'know, people are always talking about what they learned in high school and I never went to high school.
I know! I know! I know!
Monica, you asked the question.
And umm, vintage handkerchiefs y'know 'cause, people cry at weddings. I'm just gonna grab a couple of these.
Here is a book of poetry that I know Monica loves. And-and ohh God this is funny, look, this is a picture of one Halloween where she dressed up as a bride. And look, she made me carry her train, which was weird because I was Wonder Woman. Oh and here's a little purse that I found. Y'know I just thought that maybe they could hold the rings in there.
Ohh.
This stuff is great!
Oh, I forgot this was in here. Umm, this was the uh garter that I was saving for my wedding and I wanted it to be Monica's something borrowed and it's blue. Yeah...
Fifty-two minutes. So no-no brothers and sisters, huh? That must be nice. You don't have to share stuff.
Hey! We were not on a-Okay. That's fine! Fine. Y'know what Ben? One day when you are a lot older I am going to tell you that entire story over a pitcher of real margaritas, okay?
When's my daddy coming back?
Sharing is good.
Oh, you're one of those. But y'know what? I have two sisters of my own and we just-just tortured each other.
We should defiantly play football more often. Maybe there's a like league we could join or something.
Guys! Guys! Come on! It's Thanksgiving, it's not important who wins or loses. The important thing is, the Dutch girl picked me! Me! Not you! Holland loves Chandler! Thank you, Amsterdam! Good night!!
Ow!!
Isn't there a national football league.
Yes. Yes, there is, they play on Sundays and Monday nights.
The logic is, that there are two of us and we are both strong enough to break a chair in half!
No-no-no! This chair's not going anywhere.
Well, where's the logic in that?!
So Joey breaks my chair and I get nothing!
That's right!
Ohh, whoa God! Storage rooms give me the creeps! Monica, come on please hurry up honey! Please?
Look, I'm not happy about this either, but y'know if-if Ross says he's happy then we're just gonna have to keep our feelings about Emily to ourselves. Are you cool with that?
No! But y'know, I'm an actor, I'll act cool.
Rachel, if you want the little round waffles, you gotta have to wait until I find the little waffle iron.
I want the little round waffles.
Oh no-no-no don't say but! No-no, but's never good! Let's just leave it at, you like me and I like you.
Yeah but-but-but you liked me! Oh my God, I can't believe this, all this time, I liked you and you liked me!
But...
Okay uh, however...
Oh, now see that's a fancy but.
Okay, okay, okay, I got one! Anyway- The valentine Tommy Rollerson left in your locker was really from me.
A couple hours.
Oh, that's nice!
Excuse me?!
Hello? Like he was really gonna send you one? She was a big girl.
Okay..Okay.. Look. I'm sorry that I lied to you before. You were right. Ralph and I were an item but were not anymore.
Kim, hi.
Hi Rachel. Ohh, I've been meaning to ask you. Have you seen the new Ralph Lauren sheets? Ohh, what am I thinking. Of course you have.
Oh, really?
Yeah, he dumped me. He said, "Rachel, I can't do this. Even though you are a very, very, very beautiful woman. I can't do this. I'm married and I'm sorry." And then I don't know why but he said, "and you will never get promoted. Especially not above Kim, who is an integral cog in the Ralph Lauren machine."
Oh well then, so I'm just going to go back to talking to my friend here. And you can go back to enjoying your little hamburger.
It's not funny, this is actually my job.
Oh believe me, I-I-I've been there. I had to sort mannequin heads at that Mannequins Plus.
Ah, just one other thing.
Yes?!
Terry is a jerk, ok? That's why we're always saying "Terry's a jerk!" That's where that came from.
Honey, I'm sorry.
And he's going to be paying this woman? Why doesn't he just give her like a throne, and a crown, and like a, you know, gold stick with a ball on top.
Yeah, ok. You probably did everything you could.
Ok, you know what, lemme, let me just see what else I can do. All right, look, look. Why don't you just let her go on after Stephanie whatever-her-name-is. I mean, you won't even be here. You don't pay her. It's not gonna cost you anything.
No! No! Phoebe, come on! I don't want to switch! Please come on! I can throw wet paper towels here!
Okay, you have to switch with me! Monica is driving me crazy!
That's right, all the ladies want to stay at Joey's.
No but at Monica's you can eat cookies over the sink!
I know. I'm sorry.
So, come on, what was the big news Pete wanted to tell you Mon?! Or should I say Mrs. Monica Becker?
So Monica, what were you gonna tell us?
I have no idea.
No-no-no oh, keep your name, don't take his name.
He didn't ask me to marry him.
Okay now Joey, y'know that since you're returning all of this stuff right after the audition you're gonna have to wear underwear?
Pheebs, I'm so sorry.
It was really sweet. The last thing she said to me was; "Okay dear, you go get the eggs and I'm gonna get the yogurt and we'll meet at the checkout counter." And y'know what? We will meet at the checkout counter.
All right, then you'd better show me some of that too then.
Okay, it's missing something. Ooh, I know! Umm, okay.
Hey! Y'know what? You are in our apartment all the time! Okay? This is, this is just a drop in the bucket mister!
Hey! Hi!
Rach, what uh, what are you doing here?
Y'know, it-it doesn't matter. The important thing is that you're here. You're my friend, and you're here. Oh!
Okay, just a little scared. What's going on Ross?
Let me tell you something. As a woman there is nothing sexier than a man who does not want to have sex.
I think it's sexy.
Sexy?
No kidding?
Oh yeah. In fact you know what I'd do?
I don't know Tag! How can your genitals make phone calls? Okay? It's not a perfect world! Just go please.
Puzzler. A bit of a puzzle. Why don't you um, check the copy room, maybe you left the contracts in there?
How could I have left them in the copy room?
Fine.
Thank you. Hello? I still don't get it.
Alright. Well then how about I call your supervisor, and I tell her that you shot my friend in the ass with a dart?
Alright. In high school I was the prom queen and I was the homecoming queen and the class president and you... were also there! But if you take this monkey, I will lose one of the most important people in my life. You can hate me if you want, but please do not punish him. C'mon, Luisa, you have a chance to be the bigger person here! Take it!
Nope.
It'll be nice to get this off finally, won't it? Yes it will. Or we can leave it on for now, that's fine.
Y'know, with the right pair of pumps, that would be a great little outfit.
Oh, did you beat him at a board game? He turns into such a baby when he starts to lose.
Oh, I know! Umm, is it because he's always correcting people's grammar? Whom! Whom! Sometimes it's who!
Yeah? Sometimes it's...
Okay, I'm the baby.
Eh! Stop it!
Yeah, yeah and you know what, I know she's gonna wanna run again, I just don't know how to get out of it, I mean, I live with her.
Aw, Mon...
So, Phoebe runs weird huh?
Why don't you just be straight with her? Tell her the truth.
Yeah.
Wh, Ross what do you want from me? You want me, you want me to quit my job so you can feel like you have a girlfriend?
But I told you, I didn't have the time!
Yeah, well you never have the time. I mean, I don't feel like I even have a girlfriend anymore, Rachel.
No, but it'd be nice if you realised, it's just a job!
Just a job!
No, no, trust, me, it's, it's, it's much better that I know. Uh, I just liked it better before it was better...
Oh, God...
Should I not have told you?
I think she took it pretty well. You know Paolo's over there right now, so...
We should get over there and see if she's okay. Just one...second! Score! Game! Come on.
Chandler! Patrick just uh, ended things with me. Did you or did you not tell him that I was looking for a serious relationship?
Prague?
There's sooo much you don't know.
I did! I absolutely did!
You idiot!!
Huh. Well, then you'd better keep it away from Ross's hair. So this is pretty rare. How did you get that?
Oh, The Velveteen Rabbit! Oh my God, when the boy's love makes the rabbit real!
Okay, but don't touch it, because you fingers have destructive oils.
Oh, it wasn't a big deal. I just went to a couple of bookstores, talked to a couple of dealers... called a couple of the author's grandchildren.
Oh, honey, that's so sweet.
Okay, uh, you let me go grocery shopping, and I buy laundry detergent, but it's not the one with the easy-pour spout.
Because you're a kook! Instead you wait until they send you a notice.
I could do that.
Why would someone do that?! ...One might wonder.
Someone's left a glass on the coffee table. There's no coaster. It's a cold drink, it's a hot day. Little beads of condensation are inching their way closer and closer to the surface of the wood...
Ha! See, I knew, I knew you'd get it on the first guess. Isn't it cool! It's an apothecary table.
Guess!
Umm, a flea market?
Wow! Oh you can just imagine that this is where they kept all the stuff to make their potions.
Ohh, yes.
Oh oh oh, wait! You only got whipped cream in there! Ya gotta take a bite with all the layers!
Alright, Monica, I want you to have the first taste.
Really?
Okay.
Op! Wait, you dropped a pea.
Yeah, oh my God, tomorrow! That, no, it's perfect. Oh God, thank you soo much. Great! Bye! I got the interview!
Hello, Mark? Hi, it's Rachel Green. Oh no, don't you apologize. Yeah, I'll hold. He left my number at work, but he was helping his niece with her report on the pioneers.
That is so made up!
Yay!
There you go.
Hi, Pheebs? Okay, so just spoke to the nurse and the reason that your doctor is late is because uh, she's not coming.
Okay, so umm, somebody has to call Frank and Alice. And then my mom wants to know--Joey, what are you doing?!
I gotta get the before shot!
What?!
Apparently she fell in the shower and hit her head.
Gunther, Gunther, please, I've worked here for two and a half years, I know the empty trays go over there.
Yes. Yes, and ah, ah, the trees are happy too, because for most of them, it's the only chance to see New York.
...and after you've delivered the drinks, you take the empty tray....
What if you put them here.
Huh. Well, y'know that's actually a really good idea, because that way they'll be closer to the mugs. Y'know what, you should have the other waitresses do that too.
That-that is your make out buddy. Don't you recognize him? Oh wait. Ohh, Phoebe I love you. Kiss me please.
Oh, I am no women, but that is one tasty dish.
Hey. Here. Ohh, who's the silver fox?
That's not Ralph Lauren. Sounds like him though.
What?
Yeah! Closure. That's what it is, that's what I need. God, you're brilliant! Why didn't I think of that? How do I get that?
Oh, look at me, look at me. Oh, I'm on a date with a really great guy, all I can think about is Ross and his cat and his... Julie. I just want to get over him. gosh, why can't I do that?
Oy. Look, I've been through a divorce, trust me you're gonna be fine. You just can't see it now because you haven't had any closure.
Well, you know, there's no one way really, it's just, you know, whatever it takes so that you can finally say to him, "I'm over you."
Closure, that's what it is. Closure. Hello, excuse me. Excuse me, hel. . . woo
No, I know, but Ihe just went on. He's right there, he's got the blue jacket on, I... can I j-just...
Oh, no, no, I don't have one. I just need to talk to my friend.
Oh, oooh. I'm sorry. You are not allowed on the jetway unless you have a boarding pass.
No no no! Federal regulations!
OK, alright, OK, um... then could you please, uh... just give him a message for me? Please? This is very important.
Joey look, just look at it this way, the sooner Phoebe breaks Chandler the sooner this is all over and out in the open.
He's not backing down. He went to get lotion.
Oh man! Aren't you guys done yet?! I wanna sit in my chair!
Ooh!
Okay!
Oh, come on! He's glad that I came, he doesn't want me to go anywhere, balls flying all over the place!
Yeah, sure. All right, whose court is the ball in now?
I thought there wasn't a ball?
Rachel, this is my friend Tom. This is the girl I told you about.
Oh, go on! You telling people about me?
Oh, right. Sorry. But Tag's not coming; his girlfriend came into town, so he's spending Thanksgiving with her.
How come we have one extra place setting?
'Cause you invited your assistant.
Oh! Why didn't you tell me? I made him his own individual sweet potato stuffed pumpkin.
Well, I was going to, but then I figured, you know... you're food is so delicious and perfect, you can never have too many of those pumpkin things.
Someone? I brought people. Mr. Thompson, this is Phoebe. Phoebe, this is Mr. Thompson. He's the head of my department.
Oh, hi!
So glad you brought someone.
Oh, hi.
And I also brought my friend Joey...
Ugh. Excuse me, could you give this to that guy over there? Go ahead. Thank you. Sorry. Okay, Las Vegas.
Kids, new dream... I'm in Las Vegas.
Ahh, miss? More coffee?
Okay, so, I'm in Las Vegas... I'm Liza Minelli-
What you guys don't understand is, for us, kissing is as important as any part of it.
Wait, but there's no money! Well this is terrible! You guys are gonna have to get married in like a, rec. center!
My parents spent the money for our wedding!
My God! What did you order?!
Honey, it's gonna be okay.
No! No it's not! It's not gonna be okay! It sucks! No swing band! No lilies!
You guys! It was bananas, cream, and beef! I-I just cannot believe that you ate that so that I wouldn't feel bad!
No! Thank you! Monica, and Ross! I don't know what I'm gonna do about the two of you!
I'll talk to them!
Well actually, I-I didn't eat mine. It's still in the bathroom.
No it isn't, I ate that.
Well, it would be easier to move just right across the hall. Wait a minute, unless you're thinking about Naked Wednesday's.
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa, Joey!
No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no... It's okay, I mean I-look Rach, I know I scared you off with that whole Naked Thursday's thing, but we don't have to do that!
Thursday's clearly not good for ya, pick a day!
Hi!
I'm sure he will forgive you. Look, we have all been there! Y'know, you fight, you make up, it's just the way it works.
Y'know what? He will forgive you. And I like to bring a pad with me when I go answer the phone just in case... Okay...
You didn't see how mad he was, y'know?
It took two people to break up this relationship!!
Yeah! You and that girl from that copy place, which yesterday you took full responsibility for!!
Don't worry, we're just gonna search here for an hour, them we're gonna go over to Joey's and search, OK?
Oh well, that makes it not terrible.
No, yeah, we never find them! She's always best at us that wily minx.
No not okay, you can't look for Monica's presents!
But we have to!
Puzzler. A bit of a puzzle. Why don't you um, check the copy room, maybe you left the contracts in there?
In the afternoon. Mr. Zelner came into my office after lunch. He put them on my desk, and then I put a Post-It on it that said, "Must go out today." So you just keep looking in there! All right?
It's not here.
How could I have left them in the copy room?
I don't know Tag! How can your genitals make phone calls? Okay? It's not a perfect world! Just go please.
She was kinda stupid. You're right. All right, I'm just gonna go on the date. I'm gonna go on the date. That is the new plan.
No, but I was doing my thing and everything was going according to the plan!
Oh God, stop with the plan! So what, so what you saw him with a girl? Who cares?! That doesn't mean anything! Now look, you're going to go out on a date with Danny and you're going to be so charming he's gonna forget all about that stupid subway girl.
Come on, hurry!
Hey, how do you spell suspicious?
Then we took a walk down to Bendall's, and I told him not to, but he got me a little bottle of Chanel...
Y'know, it was, uh.. it was actually really great. He took me to lunch at the Russian Tea Room, and I had that chicken, where y'know you poke it and all the butter squirts out...
Not a good day for birds...
That's nice... now, was that before or after you told him to stop calling, stop sending you flowers and to generally leave you alone, hmm?
Right,.. well,.. we never actually got to that... Oh, it was just so nice to see him again, y'know? It was comfortable, it was familiar... it was just nice!
C'mon, I'm not saying it was a bad movie, I'm just saying, you know, it was a little. . . hard to follow.
Didn't you like, just get your eyes checked?
Well yeah, but, you know, uh, 27 is a dangerous eye age.
I told you there was going to be sub-titles.
I know, I just didn't want to wear my glasses on my first date.
I know, I know. And oh, and this time Chip promised that-that this time it will last at least for an entire song!
Oh totally, totally. Y'know it's not that big of deal, we already kinda did it once y'know.
I know, but y'know, this time you're gonna definitely know whether or not you did it!
So I'm thinking about asking Rachel out tonight. Y'know maybe play her that song we wrote last week.
Emotional Knapsack?
Oh is it?! Uhh, hello? Yes hi, is Rachel there? Yes she is, just one moment please. It's for me!
Phoebe!
That is a different phone.
That is damning evidence.
Oh my God! I bet that's him. My digital fairy tale is about to begin. I wonder how I should be? Should I be uh Hello? Or should I be Hi! It's Rach... Would you stop doing that?!
I'm not jealous. All right this is about, umm, people feeling certain things y'know about strippers. And y'know, and um, I...
Noo, I y'know I don't see why she has to play with you, that's all. I mean doesn't she have any y'know other stripper moms friends of her own?
You are totally jealous.
Honey, I love you too.
Ugh. Wait, wait, wait.
I have so got it. There's gonna be rumours about this, there's no way to stop it. Sophie knows, Monica and Phoebe know.
D'oh!! I've got it!
You don't have it.
How do Monica and Phoebe know?
Oh, I called them. And when they ask me what I saw, I can be very generous or very stingy.
Umm, okay. But while you dial, let me show you the features of my new ringing handbag. Oh, it does work!
No? So you're saying that if I called it, it wouldn't ring?
No.
Phoebe!
That is a different phone.
Y'know when I locked myself in the bathroom at my wedding, it was because I was trying to pop the window out of the frame.
Look, I'm sorry.
Emily is kinda taking a long time, huh?
Oh, right!
Get the hell out of there, y'know?
All right look lady here is the deal, I came here for an annulment and I am not leaving here until I get one!
Okay, do you see, do you see what you're keeping me married too?!
You need to get out of my chambers.
Yeah!
Would you like to spend the night in jail?
Good! 'Cause I've got a product report to read, it's like eight pages, I hope I don't fall asleep.
I know!! Chip? Hi! It's Monica. 'Kay. 'Kay. Okay. Okay, good-bye. Oh my God, we just had the best conversation!!
I was just leaving.
Why? Did you write it?
Wow! Look at that, Chip Matthews called. I wonder what he wants?
Hello? Um, yeah, uh, Okay ah, hold on a second, lemme lemme just check and see if see if she's here.
Good. Maybe he can switch it back.
Maybe not.
It's the woman from the hospital admissions office. She says there's a problem with the form. Oh, god, oh god...
Oh god, waddawe do, waddawe do, waddawe do?
All right, y'know what? If you don't want to believe me about this, why don't you just come with me to dinner tonight and she will tell you.
I'm not vanilla! I've done lots of crazy things! I mean I got-I got drunk and married in Vegas!
To Ross.
Okay! All right! Yeah! 'Cause I just can't picture it.
Oh-ho, you should get inside my head.
Hey, Mon, if you were hoping to sleep with Joshua the first time tonight, which one of these would you want to be wearing.
Well, I, I like the idea of naming him after someone I love, and Joey and Chandler are great names. But, all right, I don't-maybe I'll just name him The Hulk.
I knew I shouldn't have mentioned it! That's what I wanted to name my kid!
Y'know what? It really creeps me out choosing other people's sex clothes.
Sorry. I'm so exited! I've been waiting for this for months! I got my hair coloured! I got new sheets! I'm making him a very fancy meal.
Do you guys ever get the feeling that um, Chandler and those guys just don't get that we don't make as much money as they do?
Well I guess I gotta start savin' up for Ross's birthday, so I guess I'll just stay home and eat dust bunnies.
Can you believe how much this is gonna cost?
Yes! Yeah, it's like they're always saying "let's go here, let's go there". Like we can afford to go here and there.
Yes, yes, and it's, and we always have to go to, you know, someplace nice, you know? God, and it's not like we can say anything about it, 'cause, like this birthday thing, it's for Ross.
Ross! We broke up two years ago; you've been married since then. I think it's okay that we see other people.
Well...
Is that what this is about? You like Caitlin?
Well, I-I was watching her the other day at the pizza place.
Hm-mmm.
Ross-Ross, you have no idea what this means to me! I mean, I mean I was gonna be homeless. You just saved me! You're my hero!
Well, I'm-I'm just glad I could, y'know, help you out.
Wow! I'm-I'm so happy for you guys. This is so-so, not stupid.
Hero, I uh, I don't know-well, all right.
Oh, I have to go tell Monica what a wonderful brother she has!
Yeah-yeah, did-didn't you use to have a pair? They were really round, burgundy, and they made you look kind of umm...
No I didn't!
Are you sure?
Feminine.
Yes!
Whoa-whoa, there's two living rooms? God, growing up here, this place must've been a real babe magnet.
Wow! This place is fabulous!
Yeah, yeah, let me show you around. This is the uh, downstairs living room.
Yeah, well, it would've been, but uh, my parents just moved here.
Ohh, you should know, this place is a real babe magnet. Wanna make out?
Oh, no! No you guys! Come on, you don't have to do that! I'm happy for him! I am! I really-I'm-I'm happ-I'll work on it.
What's this? Is this Ross's wedding invitation?
See, maybe that's the one we should've actually hidden.
I'm sorry honey.
Yeah.
Okay, y'know what, y'know what? This playing hard to get thing is not working. Umm, hand-hand me those cherries. Okay. Okay. Hi!
I said, "Like what?"
Now that's a thinker.
Hi!
Care for a cherry?
Well y'know what? I hope Monica forgives you after you throw her, her vegetarian, voodoo, goddess circley shower!
No! Y'know what? No! No! You thing was so stupid anyway, this was ridiculous-We're gonna flip a coin! All right?! Heads!
The coins have finally forgiven me!
Rach, it's gonna be okay! You guys are the best!
Boy I tell ya, that judging stuff took a lot out of me.
I can not believe I have to walk down the aisle in front of 200 people looking like something you drink when your nauseous.
Come on out, honey! I'm telling you look good! Tell her she looks good, tell her she looks good.
Oh my God, you look so good!
So don't, I don't see why we have to go to this thing anyway, it's your ex-fiancee's wedding.
Because I promised Mindy I would.
Oh please, theyve been going out a week. They havent even slept together yet, I mean, thats not serious.
No, come on, he doesnt know this stuff. If he knew how you felt.
But hes falling in love with her.
Okay... Okay.
Oh, okay, oh.
Ooh, I just wish we hadn't lost those four months, but if time was what you needed just to gain a little perspective...
You have! Ross, you should give yourself credit. I mean my Mom never thought this would work out. It was all, "Once a cheater, always a cheater."
Umm-hmm.
WE WERE ON A BREAK!!!!!!!
Coffee house?
Yeah, you know what we should all do? We should play that game where everyone says one thing that they're thankful for.
Phoebe, you have to lift it and point.
Oh. Aw, forget it.
Ooh-ooh, I! I am thankful for this beautiful fall we've been having.
That's very nice.
Yeah, I love that story. Um, I got a question for you guys. Why do people keep is saying that is good to see me up and about?
Oh honey, I'm so proud of you, Min.
Min. Oh Rach, you're still here, at our wedding, they were packing up the chopped liver about now.
Well uh, after you ran out on your wedding, Barry's parents told people that you were sort of....insane.
Insane!
Phoebe, come on! What is the big deal? I thought this was going to be something we could do together! Y'know, I thought it would be fun!
That was not funny!
Well, I snapped! Okay? You weren't taking the class seriously.
Well, yeah! Fun is good, but y'know I also wanted to learn. Y'know, people are always talking about what they learned in high school and I never went to high school.
Ohh. Oh, so you really wanted to learn. Yeah, y'know, Pheebs I just wanted to have fun. Ohh, you know who you should go with?
Everybody? Shh, shhh. Uhhh... Central Perk is proud to present the music of Miss Phoebe Buffay.
She is a kook.
If it bothers you that much, just go out and get the shoes. No. Don't do this. This is stupid! I don't have to prove anything, I'm gonna go get them...But then everyone will know. Unless I get them, and then wake up really early and put them back! ...I need help!
Hi. Um, I want to start with a song thats about that moment when you suddenly realize what life is all about. OK, here we go. OK, thank you very much.
Oh, great. This is just...
It's the woman from the hospital admissions office. She says there's a problem with the form. Oh, god, oh god...
Maybe not.
Hello? Um, yeah, uh, Okay ah, hold on a second, lemme lemme just check and see if see if she's here.
Oh god, waddawe do, waddawe do, waddawe do?
I don't know! Why don't you just explain? What do they want? Find out what they want!
Excuse me, can I, can I bum one of those? Y'know what, actually... Okay, okay, okay, what's so funny over here?
So anyway I sent the designs over to Ralph and he's very excited about the line.
Oh that's great! You are the best!
I thought you didn't smoke.
Oh, I thought you guys meant marijuana cigarettes, y'know? Y'know what I mean, like dubbies? And I actually, I thought to myself, "Wow, those guys are crazy!" But no, I actually smoke the regular ones all, all the time.
No. No no no no no. That's Rodney McDowell. Andie McDowell is the guy from Planet of the Apes.
Great!
Ok, I just wanna be really sure this time. Andie McDowell's the girl from Four Weddings and a Funeral, right?
Oh, yeah. Ok, thank you.
You're welcome.
Thirty. Ugh, I mean thirty! Monica, do you remember mean, old Mrs. Kreeger in the fifth grade? She was thirty!
There you go!
I did it! One mile on a hippity-hop! That's it!! That's everything I wanted to do before I was thirty. Oh, except I wanted to patch things up with my sister. But oh well. Yay!! And-and girls this thing is a Godsend if you know what I mean.
Come on, let's have some fun. Huh? What do you want to do today?
Nothing. I don't want to do anything.
OK, alright, OK, um... then could you please, uh... just give him a message for me? Please? This is very important.
No, I know, but Ihe just went on. He's right there, he's got the blue jacket on, I... can I j-just...
No no no! Federal regulations!
Alright. What's the message?
Uh... I don't know.
When a guy breaks up with his girlfriend, what is an appropriate amount of time to wait before you make a move?
Oh, wait before you guys go, can I just ask you a question?
Yeah.
Oh, I'd say about a month.
Really? I'd say 3 to 4.
Well, y'know what? Thanks to you I'm half way there! Ugh! Oh! I am so mad! Ross, I don't think I have ever been this angry!
I don't wanna hear "Three failed marriages!"
Look, if you'd had two failed marriages, you'd understand!
What about the time I said we were on a break?
Ugh!
She is so good at throwing drinks in people's faces, I mean I don't think I've ever seen her finish a beverage.
She's my favorite character on DOOL.
Nice.
And the way she slaps all the time!
Oh!
Nodded off!! Ross you were snoring. My father's boat didn't make that much noise when it hit rocks!
Listen, I ah, I know it's a longshot. But, by any chance did she find that funny?
So I nodded off a little.
Come on! Forty-five minutes! Forty-five minutes the man talked about strappy backed dresses.
Well okay, how about four hours in a freezing museum auditorium listening to Professor Pitstains and he's 'Hey everybody! Remember that thing that's been dead for a gazillion years. Well there's this little bone we didn't know it had!'
No! Y'know what? No! No! You thing was so stupid anyway, this was ridiculous-We're gonna flip a coin! All right?! Heads!
Well then I demand a recount!
Actually, it wasn't that close.
The coins have finally forgiven me!
Well y'know what? I hope Monica forgives you after you throw her, her vegetarian, voodoo, goddess circley shower!
Pheebs, this guy has been obsessed with your sister, for God knows how long, okay, you don't just give up something like that.
Phoebe, what are you doing?
Oh, no, no, no, no. You know what, he's not into that stuff anymore. He quit for me.
Look, he gave me his night vision goggles and everything.
You're taking the word of a guy who has night vision goggles?
Okay, listen, I'm thinking, why don't we just tell them who we really are? I mean, it'll be fine, I really think it'll be fine.
..well, why don't you tell them? After all it, is your ankle.
You know what, it's feeling a lot better, thank you, um... Well, listen, why don't you two sit down and, and we'll get you some glasses... okay... STAT!
It will not be fine. We'll get in trouble.
Oh, Monica! Would you stop being such a wuss?
No I know, because to be a grandmother you have to be married and have children and I don't have any of those things. That's why it's so funny.
No, I know! I get it! It's funny!
No, because you're not a grandmother!
All you had to do was buy the card!
Hey! Look who's back! It's the birthday girl! How's the birthday girl feeling?
Okay, honey, what he means by that, is ...while this is a very nice gift, maybe it's just not something a boyfriend gives?
Why not?
Because she's not eleven! And it's not the seventh night of Hanukkah!
Sure it is! She needs a pen for work, she's writing, she turns it over.... "Whoa! It's time for my date with Joey!"
All right, look, look. What did... what did you get for Angela Delveccio for her birthday?
No! Phoebe just because I'm alone doesn't mean I wanna walk around naked. I mean, you live alone, you don't walk around naked.
No! So I can be by myself. Y'know? Have a little alone time.
Naked alone time.
Uh-huh! Why do you think it takes me so long to answer the door?
So, so far is this trip to Vegas better or worse than the trip to London?
Okay, hold on just a second. I'm sorry, it's for human resources, everybody has to do it. Could you just stand up please?
Oh come on, what are you talking about? You've got three years painting houses. Two whole summers at T.G.I. Friday's, come on!
It's lame, I know. But I'm a goal-oriented person, very eager to learn...
No-no-no-no. Hey!
Anyway, I should go. Okay, bye.
Yeah hon, it can't hurt to put your name down! I mean in if two years if you're not engaged you just don't use it.
What?! Are you crazy?! I'm not getting married! I'm not even engaged.
Yeah, but there's a two-year wait. And then what if you get engaged in two years and then you got to wait another two years for this place. That's four years. Chandler's not gonna wait that long. He's gonna find somebody else, y'know? Someone, someone who did put their name on the list.
Well, I mean I guess there is no harm in putting my name down.
I'm gonna do it too!
No no no no no. You wanted me to take them down, so... ..Im takin em down. Okay? Whoa!
Yeah, um, may we help you?
Rachel, what are you doing? Its freezing out here. Would you come back inside?
Oh-my-god Rachel! Rachel!
Im okay! Im okay! Mr. Heckles, Mr. Heckles could you help me please?
Pete the Weeper? Remember that guy who used to cry every time we had sex. "Was it good for you?"
Ok, ok, Roger was creepy, but he was nothing compared to Pete Carney.
Which one was Pete Carney?
Yeah, well, I'll take a little crying any day over Howard-the-"I-win"-guy. "I win! I win!" I went out with the guy for two monthsI didn't get to win once.
How did we end up with these jerks? We're good people!
Why? Who's not having. . . Are you and Julie not, are, are you and, are you and Julie not having sex?
What? C'mon, talk to me.
OK, what's the longest you've been in the relationship before ha, have, having the sex?
Technically, huh, no.
Wow. Is it, is it 'cause she's so cold in bed. Or, or is it 'cause she's like, kinda bossy, makes it feel like school?
Me? I'm great! I'm fine! I'm sooo good!! But, you know who's not great?! Men! You're a man right Ross?!
Well, if you see him, will you please tell him that I'm looking for him and that this I am not gonna throw up!
That-that's always good news. Are you okay?
Yeah.
Sit down!
No-no, that wasn't me! Well, we should get started. Let me show you my underwear. The selection of underwear we carry.
Okay.
Rachel, you needed to speak to me?
Oh-oh, sorry, it's this way, it's this way.
It's this way? Sorry.
Oh y'know what? Y'know what? Now that you know what you want you should go to Kleinman's and get it half off. This place is so overpriced.
Oh, you're so lucky. My fiancee wants the heavy metal band Carcass.
Ooh, is that spelled with a 'C' or a 'K'? Oh my God! It doesn't matter; they're both great!
I own this store.
So, does this come in another color or...
So we're okay, we're okay, we're okay, aren't we? No, we're not okay, we're not okay, there's a bump, there's a bump.
All right, I like that.
Okay.
Oh my God! Well push it in! Push it in!
I cannot push it in!
Gee, I always heard them talk about that, I just always thought that it was a club they went to. Oh God, I'm, I'm sorry.
Huh. Well, y'know that's actually a really good idea, because that way they'll be closer to the mugs. Y'know what, you should have the other waitresses do that too.
They already do. That's why they call it the 'tray spot.'
It's all right. Sweetheart.
So, this must be kinda neat for ya, huh? I mean, your Dad tells me that you get a couple of days off school, and you, you ah, don't have to sell those cookies anymore.
It was like this crazy-eyed, hairy beast man! He was like a, like a bigfoot or a yeti or something!
You guys! You guys!
We were, we were just in the storage area and we saw this really creepy man!
And he came at us with an axe, so Rachel had to use a bug bomb on him!
Yeah, I-I-I just pulled the tab and I just fogged his yeti ass!
Dear losers, do you really think I'd hide presents under the couch? P.S. Chandler, I knew they'd break you.
Oh, it's a Macy's bag!
Ooh, who's it for?
Uh-oh. She may be onto us.
We are so gonna find them this year.
Because I'm married. That's right, I am a married woman! And I came to a TV star's apartment to have an affair! Uck!
God I'm just a horrible person.
Wh-why?
That's ridiculous! I'm not a "Star," just a regular famous actor.
Yeah and I'm a horrible, horrible person.
I dunno.. I-I thought it looked better there. And I- and also, it's an extra seat around the coffee table.
Uh-oh...
How-how did that happen?
Yeah, yeah, it's interesting.. but y'know what? Just for fun, let's see what it looked like in the old spot. Alright, just to compare. Let's see. Well, it looks good there too. Let's just leave it there for a while.
I can't believe you tried to move the green ottoman.
Oh right, 'cause you always pull your pants down at the count of three and play Wipe-out on your butt cheeks.
Ross, I watched you get hypnotised in Atlantic City.
Hey, that guy did not hypnotise me! Okay.
All right, y'know forget hypnosis. The way to quit smoking is you have to dance naked in a field of heather, and then bath in the sweat of six healthy young men.
Or what my Father called Thursday night.
Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, this is so stupid! I mean, I gave Barry up, right? I should be happy for them! I am, I'm happy for them.
What?
Hi.
Really.
No. Oh, oh, I guess it would be different if I were- with somebody.
Oh, uh, Joanna I was wondering if I could ask you something. There's an opening for an assistant buyer in Junior Miss...
Gandolf the wizard. Hello! Didn't you read Lord of the Rings in high school?
No, I had sex in high school.
Okay, but that would actually be a big step down for me.
Well, actually, I meant for me. The hiring committee is meeting people all day and...
Oh, between you telling him that I wanted to have a fling and me putting out on the first date-oh, he's so gonna get the wrong idea.
You told this guy that I was looking for a fling?! You don't tell the guy that!
Why not?! I'd be thrilled if I heard that some hot girl was just looking to get-oh I see.
Hey, Joey, could you pass the cheese?
Yeah. Listen uh, I'd prefer it if you didn't call me Joey. Since I don't know anyone here, I thought it'd be cool to try out a cool work nickname.
We just uh, we just met at the newsstand. We both grabbed for the last Field & Stream. What? I read that.
Hey! You guys umm, I want you to meet Sebastian.
Hi.
Can I get you a cup of coffee?
Oh yes! Thank you!
So from that you think you've got me all figured out? Well, you don't! Y'know I-I could have toys for underprivileged kids in here!
What? Hey! No-no-no! This not cool! You don't even know me!
Come on, you got the shopping bags and the Sack's catalog.
Do you?
Well, y'know, if-if kids like to play with Capri pants.
All right, will you, will you at least tell him how hollow and unsatisfying this, dating tons of women thing is!
Hey! No-no-no-no, you can't take him away from me! I got a great partner to pick up girls with! Finally!!
I'm still right here!
What?!
I just don't want him to meet anybody until I am over my crush-And I will get over it. It's-it's not like I love him, it's just physical! But-I mean I get crushes like this all the time! I mean hell, I had a crush on you when I first met ya!
Daddy, daddy, you know what, I really wanna hear more about this, I really do, but I just have, I just have to do a, some stuff.
Ok mom, you know what, fine, I'll make an appointment ok, but you know what, right now, I gotta go, I gotta go do a thing.
Did you know your mother spent $1200 dollars on bansai trees. I felt like Gulliver around that place.
You work and you work and you work at a marriage but all he cares about is his stupid boat.
You work and you work and you work on a boat...
Yeah but, my assistant Tag does sit-ups in the office during lunch. Ohh! I could just spread him on a cracker.
Oh, I gotta get back to work.
You don't have to be back for a half-hour!
Rach, if you have a crush on this guy, why would you hire him? I mean y'know you can't date him right?
Oh no, I know that. I know that. Although, we made a joke that we spend so much time together he should call me his work wife.
Hey. Oh, I have a question. If-if-if one of you had to pick one of the other two guys to go out with, who would you pick?
Yeah, well, I kinda thought.
Hey.
No way.
I'm not answering that.
I don't know, his uh, his hair never really bothered me that much, and y'know it was always more crunchy than it was greasy.
I can do that. I certainly did it when we were going out.
Okay. Umm, before we get started, I just wanna say for the record that I love Ross, I think he's such a great guy. Here. Okay, now, close your eyes. And imagine that you're with Ross okay and imagine that you're kissing him. And you're-you're running your hands all over his body. And then you run your hands through his hair, but eew-oh gross it's some kind of grease, it's-uck! Hah?
Okay, this is going to be harder than I thought. Umm, let's try some uh, aversion therapy.
Okay.
Phoebe, what the hell are you talking about? Other than their names being similar, I'm sorry, I do not see what you're seeing.
Steve... sleeve!
OK, noone is named Sleeve.
For your information, it's a card sharp, not a card shark.
You could not be more wrong. You could try... but you would not be successful.
That's right, he can have his job back. I'm glad we got that all straightened out. There you go, Joey, you got your job back.
What?
He can have his job back.
That's great. Thanks Rach.
Yeah, pretty nice, huh? Now who's a pushover?
Okay, but Pheebs, Pheebs, Jack gave up a cow, I gave up an orthodontist. Okay, I-I-I know, I know I didn't love him-
Ah, the other Jack.
Yeah, right! See, he gave up something, but then he got those magic beans. And then he woke up, and there was this, this big plant outside his window, full of possibilities and stuff.. And he lived in a village, and you live in the Village..
Oh, see, Jack did love the cow.
But see, it was a plan. Y'know, it was clear. It was figured out, and now everything's just kinda like...
Wait a minute! You let Ross drive the Porsche and when I ask you, you say you're the only one who's allowed to drive it.
Hey!
Hey uh Mon, I saw the Porsche parked out front, can I get the keys? Thought I'd take that bad boy out for a little spin.
Yeah, well he's my brother! And plus he drives so slow he could never hurt it.
It's a car Monica! Not a rocket ship!
Y'know, I know it's totally superficial and we have absolutely nothing in common, and we don't even speak the same language but Goooooooddddddd....
God, the first time he smiled at me... those three seconds were more exciting than three weeks in Bermuda with Barry.
You know, did you ride mopeds? 'Cause I've heard... ... oh, I see... it's not about that right now. OK.
Paolo. Hi.
Ross!
I mean, look-look today you escaped death, y'know? And maybe this is a chance for you to escape getting back together with Emily?
Okay, y'know what? Maybe, this is not about seizing stuff. Maybe this is about escaping stuff.
Huh.
That does make sense. Because I do wanna seize some opportunity, but I-I really don't wanna see or talk to her.
Well, there you go!
And there's a peach cobbler warming in the oven so the plate's gonna be hot but that shouldn't be a problem for you.
Well that wasn't easy.
Ok, dinner's on.
Alright you kids, bye now.
Bye.
Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight over and over again, Ross, no, you're, you're, you're making this too hard.
Oh my God.
Okay, it's not, it's not.
Oh I'm, I'm making this too hard. Okay, what do you want me to do.
I don't know, I don't know. Urrrgh! Look, maybe we should take a break.
Oh, I would love some. But y'know what? Y'know what? Let's not drink it here. I'm feeling kinda crazy. You wanna go to Newark?
Great! It went great. Really great. Hey, is that wine?
Yeah. You, uh, you want some?
Uh, okay, yeah, we could do that, but before we head off to the murder capital of the North-East, I was, uh, kinda wanting to run something by you. Y'know how we were, uh, y'know, talking before about, uh, relationships and stuff? Well-
Oh God, Ross, I cannot do this.
No, honey, they're not, but don't worry, because we are going to find them, and until we do, we are all here for you, ok?
I'm having a baby in here! Ok, everyone stand back. Ow.
Are they here yet?
Ok.
Ok?
Really. Mindy, if it'll make you feel any better, when I was engaged to him he went through a whole weird thing too.
Um, what- what would make you think that?
Well, ever since we announced the engagement, he's been acting really weird, and then last night, he came home smelling like Chanel.
Oh God! You see, that's what I was afraid of!
What? What's what you were afraid of?
How would you like to sit in a chair that fully reclines, has a rolling massage, and speakers in the head rest?
Hey Chandler!
Hey!
Yeah, I'd love to but I've tried that so many times they won't even let me in the store anymore.
Well what if I told you, you can do it in my apartment?
Well, they said would but they would only give me store credit. I mean, what am I going to do, get a thousand regular cats?
Maybe that's because she's a minion of the anti-Christ.
Rach, why won't they take it back?
Look, if you want you can keep it at our place until you find out what to do with it.
No Mon that's not the point. I'm out a thousand dollars, I'm all scratched up, and I'm stuck with this stupid cat that looks like a hand!
No, no Phoebe no, I was...no. You know what, I was, I was actually just checking to, see, if I could run. And I can!
Oh, sorry about that stuff hanging in there. It's just my thongs are too delicate for the dryer.
Hi! Oh yeah, uh-huh, it's me. I saw you grab your running shoes this morning and sneak out. You lied so you could run by yourself.
Please Rachel, I am not an idiot.
No, wait Phoebe.
Ben y'know when uh, when you were a baby, you and I used to hang out all the time. 'Cause I was, I was your daddy's girlfriend.
Does calling it not mean anything anymore?!
We are going to have a legitimate member of the clergy! And when I say legitimate I mean, gay and in control of his saliva!
But you're not anymore!
No, I'm not.
And you know which one we should see? The 1996 Tony award winner. Do you happen to know the name of that one?
You know what we should all do? Go see a musical.
Sure...
I don't know... um, Grease?
No....
Hey Mon, let's give Pete a chance Come on, he was funny, he seems really nice, and that check thing was adorable.
Here you go.
Thanks
What check thing?
As a joke, this customer at work who has a crush on me gave me a $20,000 tip. His number is on the check, he just did so I'd call him.
Okay, y'know, would you feel better if we went someplace else? I mean we could pack all this stuff up and y'know go to your apartment.
But, they're across the hall! I mean that's two doors away, it would take them a long time to peck their way back over here.
Okay, that's-that's not funny. Uhh.
Oh, they're working on this week, it's a total mess. But uh, I'm staying at my parents' house, we could go there.
Your parents'?
Okay. All right. Honey listen. When I tell you what I'm about to tell you, I need you to remember that we are all here for you and that we love you.
Oh good God! I've fallen down!
What's going on?
Okay, you're-you're really freaking me out.
We can't find Chandler...-'s vest. We can't find Chandler's vest.
The earring? No. But look, I found my sunglasses under the couch! I've been looking for these since like last summer.
Hey!
Did you find it?
Okay, those are my sunglasses, you borrowed them from me.
Okay, calm down, here they are.
Oh God, it says he was hit by an ice cream truck and dragged for nine--teen blocks. Oh. Oh my God.
Oh my God, Le Poo, our dog!
Le Poo's still alive?!
Sweetie, we heard you crying. Please don't cry.
It's Le Poo.
Well, for your information, Paolo is gonna be in Rome this New Year, so I'll be just as pathetic as the rest of you.
Hey, do you guys know what you're doing for New Year's? Gee, what?! What is wrong with New Year's?
Nothing for you, you have Paolo. You don't have to face the horrible pressures of this holiday: desperate scramble to find anything with lips just so you can have someone to kiss when the ball drops!! Man, I'm talking loud!
Yeah, you wish!
It's just that I'm sick of being a victim of this Dick Clark holiday. I say this year, no dates, we make a pact. Just the six of us- dinner.
Yeah! Y'know, ever since I ran out on Barry at the wedding, I have wondered whether I made the right choice. And now I know.
Yeah.
Really?
Aww...
Big day.
Oh, Ross, relax. It's probably like two dollars for the first contraction, and then fifty cents for each additional contraction.
Yes, Joey's made arrangements to have his baby in a movie from the 50's.
God, I don't believe this. She could be giving birth in the cab.
What, it's ok when Chandler does it?
You have to pick your moments.
Well that was depressing, I think I just bought a soft pretzel from one of the kids from Fame. Ready to go to the movies?
No! No boom-boom before big fight!
How 'bout just a boom?
Um-hmm. Oh wait! This is Bonnie.
Hi!
Well, that's a lot better than Ross trying to kiss me in High School, and saying that he did it because he needed chapstick.
Yeah, but she also invited you and Ross. Yeah, honey, I'm sorry, but I don't think that was a romantic thing.
Oh. Maybe. But hey I know how I can find out. We're going to a New Year's Eve party, right? So at midnight, I can kiss her. And if she kisses me back, great! Y'know? But if she says 'Dude, what the hell are you doing?' I can say 'It wasn't me, it was New Years!'
It was a dry day.
We are going to Dick Clark's New Year's Rocking Eve!
Aww, Joey, come here. Look honey, I know this must be really, really difficult for you and I--Oh, I'm sorry. Am I hurting you?
I know what you need, you need a bodyguard. Hey Ross, what is Ben doing after preschool?
Hey listen, come on, Joey is having a problem! A little girl is beating him up.
Hey!
Hey! I brought you some house warming gifts.
Oh, yeah, yeah. Actually, I got the extended disco version, with three choruses of "You'll never make it on your own".
Ooh, I hate when my father calls me that.
Did he give you that whole "You're-not-up-to-this" thing again?
Uh-huh, uh-huh.
Hi, Joey.
Yeah. Well. Hey uh Joe, would mind going over to Chandler's bedroom and get that book back that he borrowed from me?
I'm not gonna tell you, but if you found out on your own, that would be okay and then we could talk about it. Right?
Well, then it wouldn't be a secret. So yeah, that would be okay. Yeah. Yeah!
Now? You want me to go over there now?
Yeah!
I just never had a relationship with that kind of passion, you know, where you have to have somebody right there, in the middle of a theme park.
Step back.
We have a winner!
Well, it was the only thing to do there that didn't have a line.
There, well, see? Barry wouldn't even kiss me on a miniature golf course.
No! Ross, come on! No! Listen, look I thought a lot about how to tell you this and the bottom line, Ross, is we can not stay married.
Hey!
Listen, I know you wanted to talk to me, but I have an idea that may make you want to stay married. We register, and you get to keep all the presents!
I don't know if it's true.
Oh b-b-but it is!
Well, umm, I guess I read Little Women more than once. But I mean that's a classic, what's so great about The Shining?
How often do you read it?
Haven't you ever read the same book over and over again?
The question should be Rach, what is not so great about the shining. Okay? And the answer would be nothing. All right? This is like the scariest book ever. I bet it's way better than that classic of yours.
Okay. Ah, well we'll just see about that, okay. I will read The Shining, and you will read Little Women.
She is not Rachem. What the hell's a Rachem? Is that some stupid paleontology word that I wouldn't know because I'm just a waitress.
Oh! I do not have chubby ankles!
No, no, wait, ok, ok, look at the other side. Look at Julie's column.
No, Rach, come on. Rach! Rach, no, no! She's not Rachel, she is, she is not, Ra--Rachel?
My diary! My diary, that's brilliant. I should have told her it was my diary, she never would have made me read her my diary.
I don't know, I mean I would give anything to work for a designer, y'know, or a buyer.... Oh, I just don't want to be 30 and still work here.
Well then how come you're still at a job that you hate, I mean why don't you quit and get 'the fear'?
Because, I'm too afraid.
Yeah, that'd be much worse than being 28, and still working here.
Rachel?
...So a bird just grabbed it, and then tried to fly away with it and, and then just dropped it on the street?
Are you kidding?
What's not to like? Custard? Good. Jam? Good. Meat? Gooooood.
Yes, but if it's any consolation, before the bird dropped it, he seemed to enjoy it.
Rachel, come here. Okay, I was just starting to take my Thanksgiving nap, and I had another dream about Jack.
Well, it'd better not be about the apartment pants, because I just pitched the idea to my boss at Ralph Lauren and she loved it.
What's up?!
Umm, I think there's something you should maybe know.
No. No. It's just I was umm, I was with Ross and Jill after you left and umm, I'm pretty sure I saw a little spark between them.
What?!
Wow, Monica, I love that, you really have faith in me. Thank you. Technical question, how do you know when uh, the butter's done?
So, if-if I mess this up, there's nothing else for dessert?
You're not gonna mess it up.
Well, it's done about two minutes before it looks like that.
Hey!
Oh they are nice. We-we custom-make tuxedos for celebrities and then when they're done with them they just send 'em back.
I'm Monica's maid of honor. Okay? Don't try to blue pin me!
Well, what's the deal with these? These-these look nice.
You mean like for award shows?
Some of them.
Y'know I don't, I don't understand guys, I mean I-I would never congratulate Monica on a great stew by y'know, grabbin' her boob.
I gotta tell ya, I think it's okay to be that guy.
Yeah, maybe it's like y'know, that jock thing. Y'know how football players pat each other after touchdowns.
Yeah, I know, for a really great stew you just y'know, stick your head in between 'em.
Okay, can we please go eat?
No! I'm sorry, honey, it's just that last week I got all but three answers and I really want to finish a whole one without any help.
And not one of your coupons for an hour of "Joey Love."
Ooo, a crossword! Can I help?
Fine. But you can't help me develop my new universal language.
Hey!
Love to love ya baby! Ow! Love to love ya baby! Ow! Love to love ya, baby! Darnit! Ugh.
Oh! Look what happened! {Don't get your hopes up guys, we only get to see her from the back or from the neck up. Its times like these I wish that the networks would broadcast some nudity other than Denis Franz's butt.} Huh, check me out! I'm in my kitchen...naked! I'm picking up an orange. I'm naked! Lighting the candles, naked, and carefully.
Oh my God! That's Rachel naked! I can't look at that! I am looking at this. Okay, vivid colors, expressive brush strokes-Unless she wants me to be looking at that. She knows I'm home. She knows I can see her. What kind of game is she playing? I think maybe someone's lonely tonight. Oh-ho, Dr. Geller! Stop it! You're being silly! Or, am I?
Hey.
May I come in?
Okay, well this is all very impressive Hilda, um I just have one last question for you. Uh, how did I do? Was this okay?
And you were at this job for four years?
That's right.
What?
I've never interviewed anyone before. I've actually never had anyone work for me before. Although when I was a kid, we did have a maid, but this is-this isn't the same thing.
Ohh, yeah, well I wanted to give Emily a big American good-bye cheer. So okay! Ready! Okay! Gimme an 'E!'
Hi!
Nice uh, costume.
E!
Gimme an 'M!'
Honey, come on, I have to be at work in like ten minutes Oh, all right, well it's not like I'm employee of the year or anything.
Oooh.
We're all alone in an empty apartment.
There it is.
Oh, oh, that's what you're talking about. Hey.
Okay, swear you won't tell, but when Mark left he gave me a key to Joanna's office. Do you wanna see the list?
That's weird, she locked the door.
Y'know why? She's got the Christmas bonus list in there. I saw her working on it this morning.
Yeah!
Hi! How are you?
Hi, welcome to our tropical Christmas party. You can put your coats and sweaters and pants and shirts in the bedroom.
Good luck Phoebs.
OK, here I go. . . here I go. . . I'm goin'.
It's hard to tell because I'm sweating, but I use exactly what the gel bottle says, an amount about the size of a pea. How, how can that be too much?
Ice, ice, ice squares anyone? Take a napkin. Alright.
Well, I did my best to convince him that I'm not some crazy girl who is dying to get married-I'm just going through a hard time.
Well, I just called Joshua...
Oh, how did it go?
What did he say?
Well uh, his answering machine was very understanding. Ugh. I feel blue.
Oh what, my whole insane jealousy thing? Well, y'know, as much fun as that was, I've decided to opt for sanity.
Yeah, Monica's settin' me up.
But uh, uh, what about uh, Ross and uh. . .?
So you really OK about all this?
Oh yeah, c'mon, I'm movin' on. He can press her up against that window as much as he wants. For all I care, he can throw her through the damn thing.
Y'know what else is really great about him, oh, what is the word for the adult that doesn't have dinosaur toys in their bedroom?
I know, isn't he great? It's so nice to finally be in a fun relationship, y'know? There's nothing boring about him, and ah, I bet he's never set foot in a museum.
Well maybe he'll get to go soon, like on a class trip or something.
Oh!
What was that?
When somebody does not buzz you in, Ross, that means go away. That doesn't mean please climb up the fire escape.
Yeah, by the way, good luck in your next life as a dung beetle.
Rach! Whoops! Rach, hey, open up, please!
I just wanna read something. It's your pro list.
Not interested.
Uh-huh. No, I hear what you're saying and-and-and that makes a lot of sense but can I just say one more thing? Look how pretty!
I love him. He's so pretty I wanna cry! I don't know what to do. Tell me what to do.
Come on you know what to do! You hire the first one! You don't hire an assistant because they're cute, you hire them because they're qualified.
Let's see. Oh my God! Oh... But no! No! You can't-you can't hire him, because that-it's not professional. Umm, this is for me yes? Thanks.
Okay you're right. I'll hire Hilda tomorrow. Dumb old perfect for the job Hilda!
You are right there with Emily. And it's y'know, it's kinda like.... it's a tie! Well, I gotta get, I gotta get back to the dishes.
I know isn't it? It's like I'm right there with Joshua.
Uh-huh.
I gotta get to work.
Oh yeah? Fine.
Well, they never have any paper in there y'know. So my rule is 'no tissue, no tuschy.' Well, if everybody's going.
No. Thank you.
No, Rachel never pees in public restrooms.
No, y'know what don't close it 'cause the... keys...are in there.
Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no!!
Oh Mon, listen I have to ask! Okay, Joey Tribbiani invited me back to his apartment, now does he do this with a lot of girls?
Well uh, Archie needs money to fix his jalopy , uh but he doesn't want Reggie to just give him the money. So Reggie hires him as his assist-as his butler. And then makes him do all these crazy things like bring him milkshakes that can't have lumps in them.
Wait a minute. That sounds a little familiar! Did they already do that one? 'Cause I think I read it!
Yeah, a lot. A lot, a lot!
Ohh! And I'm one of them!! Wow! Oh, I just cannot believe this! I mean, Joey Tribbiani!
No! I mean come on! This is a huge deal! Fine I want-I need more details, who-who initiated the first kiss?
I can't believe you would say that!
Sorry. Monica and Chandler are making love.
I don't know.
Is he romantic with her?
What? Come on, it's not like I'm asking for this girly clock or anything, which, by the way, I also think is very cool.
Monica, Monica, look at this lamp. Is this tacky or what? We have to have this.
Rache, I think we have enough regular lamps.
It doesn't go with any of my stuff.
Well, what about my stuff?
Uh, yeah. Uh, Monica, y'know, honey, I've been thinking about it and I've decided thisthis whole Ross thing, it's just not a good idea.
From you. I exchanged the blouse you got me.
Well, it's the thought. Hey, doesn't Ross's flight get in in a couple hours? At gate 27-B?
Oh, why?
Because, I feel like I wouldn't just be going out with him. I would be going out with all of you. Oh, and there would just be all this pressure, and I don't wanna...
Okay great, hold on a sec! Oh, here you go! You don't mind do ya? That would really help me out a lot! Thanks!
Sure, I'll do it with ya.
Okay.
I mean I-I don't I think I have enough quarters.
I have quarters!
Oh. That's so Monica can keep track. That way if one on them is missing, she can be like, 'Where's number 27?!'
I know.
Why do all you're coffee mugs have numbers on the bottom?
Y'know what?
No. And I don't think I'm gonna want to.
You're sister? You're sister's asleep on the couch? Ohhh! I saw her with you on the subway and now she's asleep on the couch!
So did I. I'm really glad Monica asked us out.
I'd love to ask you in, but uh, my sister's visiting and I think she's asleep on the couch.
Oh, I thought I heard you.
Oh hey, great, you're up. Rachel, this is my sister Krista. Krista, this is Rachel.
Oh wow. That-y'know what? That is so unfair. Y'know what? Now I want to steal your thunder! Come on Ross, let's go have sex!
Monica, why? Why would I ever want to take away from your night?
I don't know! I don't-maybe you're feeling a little resentful. Maybe ah, maybe you thought you'd get married first! Maybe you can't stand the fact that your formally fat friend is getting married before you!
I can't believe you're gonna have sex on my engagement night!!
Well, somebody should.
Okay! Okay-okay look-no I did, I just wanted this stuff and I know how you feel about Pottery Barn. Just... Come on don't be mad.
No! No! No! No it's not! No it's not! Come on! Phoebe, ours is totally different! I mean we don't have the... We don't have the...that lamp! And-and that screen is y'know, on the other side.
Oh my God. This is where you got all our stuff, Pottery Barn! Oh my God!
No-no-no, but I am mad! I am mad! Because this stuff is everything that is wrong with the world! And it's all sitting up in my living room and all I can think about is how I don't have that lamp!
Well then honey, buy the lamp! Hey, we have that 60 bucks from Ross.
Well, you're lucky you never met that bitch Sharon Majesky. Anyway, umm... The rest of you life, y'know? Any regrets?
Okay, well then how about puberty! Come on, that's always a painful time! Y'know your friends invite you to a slumber party and then they stick your hand in warm water while you're sleeping so that you pee in your sleeping bag.
Nope! That never happened to me!
Nope.
All right Paul, I'm not asking for a lot here. Okay? Just give me something. Anything!
Umm Pheebs, remember when we were in the coffee house we decided that I was going to keep the uh, the cute guy's cell phone?
How are ya?
Good.
Yeah.
And remember how I said I was going to keep it in my purse so that if it rang I could just pick it up?
Come on, it's not a big deal! We stayed up all night coming up with a plan so that us dating will not be a problem.
Well, why shouldn't I be? I have great friends! I have a wonderful job!
Where you can make out with your assistant.
Oh yeah, what's the plan?
We... We are not... ...going to let it... be a problem.
I can't believe you don't want to know. I mean, I couldn't not know, I mean, if, if the doctor knows, and Carol knows, and Susan knows....
Uh, I am, uh, being naked?
Um, that's really your decision, I mean, some people prefer, you know, to take off...oh whoops! You're being naked!
And Monica knows...
Wha, heh, how could you know, I don't even know!
I have the best job in the entire world! The most adorable guy came over today, and I got to dress him up all day!
I'll tell you what, Chandler, why don't you call me when you grow up!
Yeah, well, don't expect that to happen anytime soon!
Rachel has a new doll.
Oh, I wish he was a doll, then I could get a Rachel doll and bump them together and make kissy noises. Oh! And he has the most beautiful name, I never realised it, Joshua! Josh-u-a! Joshua! Josh.
I know, but it's just it's the first time, and I just don't want her to think that because I didn't marry Barry, that my life is total crap, you know?
Oh god.
I can't believe you're so uptight about your mom comin'.
Talk about crap. Try listening to Stella Niedman tell the story of her and Rod Steiger for the hundredth time.
Uh, Pheebs, how long do you think this lady'll be with us?
Don't say anything. I don't wanna speak, I don't wanna think. I just want you to take me and kiss me and make love to me right here, right now.
Hi.
I can't believe you came back.
Rachel! Rachel!
What?
Well, let me just check that with what I got here, all right see 038 is not the number for this store, 038 is Atlanta. And I...
I love Mark. Do you know Mark?
Yeah!!
Pepper?
None for me.
Well, oh, Mark, I'm doing this for the wrong reasons, y'know? I'm just doing it to get back at Ross. I'm sorry, it's not very fair to you.
I can't do this.
Yep. Yep, that's what I didn't want to know.
Ahh! Fair, schmair! Y'know? Look, if you want to get back at Ross, I am here for you. Really? No-no, I say-I say, I say we get back at him right on this couch. Right here!
Oh God. I'm sorry about this.
This one's from Joey... feels like a book. Thinks it's a book... feels like a book. And... ...it's a book!
OK, this one right here is from me.
OK... ah, it's light... ...it rattles... it's... Travel Scrabble! Oooohhh, thank you!
Oh, it's Dr. Seuss!
: That book got me through some tough times.
I'm just bummed about the way I left things with Ross. I shouldn't have lied to him about having to work. He seemed so mad at me.
Oh, I don't know. I guess we have to eat.
Yeah, I do. What's the matter?
Eh, don't be so hard on yourself. If someone I was still in love with was getting married...
Still in love with?!
Yeah, I said what was okay when I thought she was some weird bald chick. I mean, y'know, that girl has hair got all over head!
Ohh, well, this is just perfect!
Well I'm sorry, I thought you said it was okay.
Well, maybe it won't work out. Maybe Ross won't like her personality.
Why, does she have a bad personality?
Joey, you're such an amazing actor! How do you know where Dr. Drake Remoray leaves off and Joey Tribbiani begins?
I was kidding.
So was I.
Well, with Dr. Drake they always tell me what to say. And with Joey, I pretty much have to make it up on my own.
Wow! Tell me something Joey--Whoa! I just fell right off the couch there.
That's-that's great! See? I already feel like I know you a little better! Thank you. Okay, come on. Now we can go eat. Let's go.
Hm-mmm.
I wanted a big wheel. And instead my parents got me this little plastic chicken that you hop around on. It was embarrassing; kids made fun of me. That was a pretty tough year.
It was horrible. They called me chicken boy.
Oh!
Hi! Sorry to bother you, but I don't think we can accept your acceptance of our apology, it just doesn't really seem like you mean it.
Okay.
Yesss?
Yeah.
O-kay!
Phoebe, come on can we finish this later? Cause I wanna go running before it gets dark. Oh! Why don't you come with me?!
What?
Oh, you're no ordinary roommate are you?
Really?
Yeah, it'll be fun. We'll run in the park. It'll be like our first y'know roommate bonding thing.
All right. All right, all right, all right, all right, I know it's stupid! I will go see him this afternoon, and I will just put an end to it!
I have my reasons.
Okay, how about the fact that he's engaged to another woman, who just happens to be your ex-best friend?
Wow... Wow!
Yeah.
Oh it was great! It was great! I went down there just like you said, y'know? And we talked business. Kim totally took my opinions.
Yeah?! So's yours!
How did work go?
You stink!
Thanks!
Ok mom, you know what, fine, I'll make an appointment ok, but you know what, right now, I gotta go, I gotta go do a thing.
You want me to see a therapist?
Sweetheart, you obviously have a problem. You've chosen a boyfriend exactly like your father.
Did you know your mother spent $1200 dollars on bansai trees. I felt like Gulliver around that place.
Daddy, daddy, you know what, I really wanna hear more about this, I really do, but I just have, I just have to do a, some stuff.
No, there's nothing to make up, she's gonna know that I have a key to her office, I've got to get you locked up back the way you were!
When she sees that you're gone, she's gonna know that I let you out, and that I was in here, and I'm gonna get fired!
I'll make something up! I'm good at lying, I actually did borrow your Walkman!
Oh-ho-ho, I don't think so!
Well, this is much better.
All right let me see. Uma Thurman, Winona Ryder, Elizabeth Hurely, Michelle Pfieffer, and Dorothy Hammel?
And who laminated it?
That would be me.
Hey, it's my list.
Okay honey, you do realize she only spins like that on ice.
Come on, it's a hypnosis tape. This woman at work used it for two weeks straight and she hasn't smoked since.
Well, I'm really sick of your smoking, so I brought something that is going to help you quit.
Oh. Nope, that patch is no good.
Pffhah.
What's your problem?
Well, I was actually-I-I came over here to-to borrow this lamp. To umm, look at my books, y'know, see them a little better.
Hey! Hi!
Wh-wh-what are you doing here?
Okay great!
Yeah!
What? You wanna see me self-defend myself?! Go over there and pretend you're a sexual predator! Go on! I dare ya!!
Yeah!
After one class? I don't think so.
Well, of course you can defend yourself from an attack you know is coming, that's not enough. Look, I studying kara-tay for a long time, and there's a concept you should really be familiar with. It's what the Japanese call unagi.
Isn't that a kind of sushi?
Ohh, well, isn't that just lovely. That's something the two of you will be able to enjoy for a really, really, really, really, really long time.
Together.
Yeah, we figure it'll live with Ross half the time, and with me half the time.
Hopefully.
Well. Woah, look at that! I gotta go, I gotta date. With a man. Um, OK, you guys have a really, uh, have a really good night and you two have a, uh, have a, uh, really good cat. OK, we're not supposed to take these when we leave.
Ohh, it's gonna be so great! I'm gonna get to help decide what we sell, I'm gonna have an office with walls and everything. I'm gonna have walls!
Yes!!!
You got the job?! Why didn't you tell me?
Okay, is this the day of good news or what? I got us a job! The wedding reception.
Ohh! Umm, Phoebe, I kinda need to talk to you about that. Umm, well I-I-I think it might be time for me to take a step back from catering.
I thought this might happen today. Ross, I know the holidays can be rough. Y'know? And it's probably really hard for you to be alone right now.
I just- I don't think us getting back together is a good idea.
Eh?
You're alone.
No, I-I live with Phoebe. I mean you're alone, alone. And I just-it's just not the time for us. I'm sorry.
Anyway, I'm going to be the coordinator of the woman's collection, I'll work right under the director, it's the perfect, perfect job for me!
Wh-what?!
I got this pair marked excess, I gotta tell ya, there was no room for excess anything in there.
Wow! Well, if you nail the interview, you'll get it!
Yeah.
Wow! I don't know if I could ever do that. I always figured the first time I had a baby was with somebody I love and that baby would be a...keeper.
Yeah, what's your point?
Well, the stuff I just mentioned.
Y'know you guys were a lot more supportive when I wanted to make denim furniture.
No, Pheebs, listen, if you decide to do this, we'll be supportive like crazy.
Chandler, I gotta tell you, I love your mom's books! I love her books! I cannot get on a plane without one! I mean, this is so cool!
C'mon, she's your mom!
Exactly. Weekend At Bernie's! Dead guy getting hit in the groin twenty, thirty times! No?
Yeah, well, you wouldn't think it was cool if you're eleven years old and all your friends are passing around page 79 of 'Mistress Bitch.'
C'mon, Chandler, I love your mom. I think she's a blast.
Okay, very cute braces. Anyway y'know what, the point is Tag, start looking because you are going to find those contracts on your desk.
Oh how can you possibly know? Look at this mess, Tag! I mean, this is what I'm talking about! You have to be organized! You've got newspapers! You've got magazines! You got-Ohh! And who is this chippy? A little young for you Tag, but whatever.
It's my sister.
So when do you imagine you gave them to me? In the morning or in the afternoon?
In the afternoon. Mr. Zelner came into my office after lunch. He put them on my desk, and then I put a Post-It on it that said, "Must go out today." So you just keep looking in there! All right?
Good. Although y'know, he-he's a private guy. Y'know, I wish I could get him to open up a little bit, share some feelings.
Oh, I'm sorry. You wanna bite?
So how are things going with Paul?
That's easy! You just have to think of him as a-as a jar of pickles that won't open.
So what are you saying; I should run him under hot water and bang his head against a table?
Okay! Here we go! Okay! Hi, Joey! It's Rachel! Umm, I am free tomorrow night. Yeah, sure, sure I can bring some sandwiches.
You're not dying Hope, you're gonna live a long, healthy life. With me.
Oh Drake.
So honey this uh, this threesome thing umm, I mean how-how are you gonna start to find...
Ooh, actually I've been making a list of all the women I know who might be into doing this!
Yeah. Your teeth? Yes, I saw them from outside. You guys are never going to believe this. But, Phoebe made out with Ralph Lauren.
Yeah.
Oh, hey, hey Rach, do you notice anything..ahh...
What???
Oh my god.
Me either. Umm, all right, first thing I need you to do is go downstairs and find a women named Hilda and tell her to go home.
Yeah!
I can't believe it!
Hey.
Hey! Good, you're home!
Okay, come on-Joey, I'll buy you a new one! All right? We'll go down to the store right now and we'll-we'll get you a new chair.
Joey, Joey I am so sorry.
I told you not to move it! Rach, how would you feel if say, I wanted to move you mom, and you said don't, and I did it anyway and her head fell off?
She's not even cold yet!
But don't you think Rosita would've wanted you to move on? I mean y'know, she did always put...your comfort first.
Well, uh something about having second thoughts about the wedding and did you guys make a mistake breaking up and uh, she wants you to call her.
No, she left a message. But it-it kinda got erased. There's just something wrong with your machine.
Well, okay, what-what did she say?
Wow!
Now, that-that was a good thing that I told you, right?
Ooh, is this one of those things where you throw it in a bag with some graveyard dirt and hang it from a north-facing tree?
Okay.
And a glass of tepid water.
Uh, only if you have the hiccups too. Yeah, the pictures are for you, the water and the chocolate is for me. I just didn't feel like getting up. Okay, I'm gonna show you a picture of Ross. Okay? And you're going to remember all of the bad things about him. All right? Really focus on his flaws.
I can do that. I certainly did it when we were going out.
Ooh, I was soo nervous about that letter. But the way you owned up to everything, it just showed me how much you've grown. Y'know?
Oh-hooo, I missed you.
I missed you too.
I suppose.
You have! Ross, you should give yourself credit. I mean my Mom never thought this would work out. It was all, "Once a cheater, always a cheater."
Oh no, I know that. I know that. Although, we made a joke that we spend so much time together he should call me his work wife.
Yeah but, my assistant Tag does sit-ups in the office during lunch. Ohh! I could just spread him on a cracker.
Rach, if you have a crush on this guy, why would you hire him? I mean y'know you can't date him right?
Soon he'll be able to call you, that lady he knew who got fired.
I am not gonna get fired, because I'm not gonna act on it.
No! Downstairs! And we got to talking y'know, for like two hours, and I really liked him so I invited him up here for a cup of coffee.
Well, y'know he lost his keys so he was looking for them...
In your mouth?!
You were at the coffeehouse!
Ross, what's the big deal? So I kissed the guy!
Well, someone was supposed to write "Rach, take down the lights" and put it on the re... frigerate... How long has that been there?
So tell me something, is leaving the Christmas lights up part of your plan to keep us merry all year long?
Ah no, you see, someone was supposed to take them down around New Years... but obviously someone forgot.
Hey, where you been?
I went back to Riffs. I think Ursula likes me. All I ordered was coffee, she brought me a tuna meltt and four plates of curly fries.
Ok, he's goin' to get my coat. He's goin' to get my coat. Oh my god, you guys. I can't believe this. This is unbelievable. What's that?
Let me get my coat.
Ok. No, hey, whoa, whoa, I'll get your coat.
What? Nothing.
What's that? What? I saw my name. What is it?
Hey, come on! I had this friend from college and I made the stupid mistake of telling Joey that one time...she and I y'know...kissed a little bit.
Joey's!
Okay...
Yeah, I'm sure that happened.
It-it did!
God, the first time he smiled at me... those three seconds were more exciting than three weeks in Bermuda with Barry.
If you want, I'll do it.
I know, I just want to bite his bottom lip. But I won't.
You know, did you ride mopeds? 'Cause I've heard... ... oh, I see... it's not about that right now. OK.
Y'know, I know it's totally superficial and we have absolutely nothing in common, and we don't even speak the same language but Goooooooddddddd....
Oh my God! Oh my God!! Ohh, Jessica Lockhart!! In my apartment!! I am such a huge fan! I am such a huge fan!
Hi.
Hey!
Well, it's nice to know that you...
MONICA!!!! MONICA!!!!
Well, I was thinking maybe a um, a romantic dinner with um, candles and wine and then uh, maybe going back to my place for um, dessert.
OK, listen, I'm sorry about last night and I really want to make it up to you.
No, you, ya know there's no need to make it u. . . how?
Humm, that sounds, I don't, perfect.
What's this.
Well, there was a disaster in shipping and I've got to get this order in. Honey, I'm so sorry, but it looks like I'm gonna be here all night.
Oh, hi.
Hey, what's going on?
What, do you, well umm, oh how about I come up there?
No-no-no, no, honey please, I've got, I've just have so much to deal with.
Well y'know I was just in the neighborhood and I passed by your building and I thought to myself, "What's up with Carol and sweet, little Ben?"
Hi!
What a nice surprise! What are you doing here?
Can I ask what-Come on in.
Okay.
And y'know what, I'm gonna, I'm gonna go to bed now, but ah, on my way to work tomorrow morning, I'm gonna stop by around 8:30.
So, I love you.
I love you.
Okay.
Bye.
Y'know what? I've just had it with high school boys! They are just silly. Silly, stupid boys! I'm going to start dating men!
Ugh! I cannot believe Chip dumped me for that slut Nancy Branson. I am never going out with him again. I don't care how much he begs!
I think his begging days are over now that he's going out with Nancy Branson.
Umm, I'm sorry Judy, I couldn't find that bowl that you and Jack were looking for.
Call them mom and dad you loser!
Look Joey, come on she's so perfect for you! I mean she's sweet, she-she likes baseball, and she-she had two beers at lunch.
Joey, she's so cool. She speaks four languages.
Man, do you know what guys want!
My beers?! Look you guys, she's a very nice girl. Okay? We had a good time, but I just-I don't see it going anywhere.
Yeah, but you always say that.
Oh really? So you're saying they just slid out of your bottom drawer, crawled across the floor, then jumped on to my desk?!
You put these on my desk!
I did not!
How did you know they were in my bottom drawer?
I am so hot for you right now.
Yeah! Guess who walks into my office is the end of my story. It was Ralph Lauren! Ralph Lauren walked into my office!
Joey!
Oh, you weren't finished?
Uh Rach, if you're gonna start another story, at least let me finish mine.
It's the same story.
Oh my goodness, she had the smoothest skin! I mean when I stuck that dollar bill in her g-string and grazed her thigh...
See, I don't know, for me it would have to Chantal.
Oh, Chantal!
Phase Three! I just achieved Phase Three!
Really?!
Um, this is gonna sound kinda goofy but uhhm, my friend over there, who cooks by the way, um, she thinks you're cute.
Excuse me. Hi.
Hi.
You don't think I'm cute?
I, I don't know, um, do you think you're cute? OK, we're kinda gettin' off the track here. Um, I was supposed to come here and tell you my friend thinks you're cute. So what should I tell her?
Oh-oh-oh, symbolism! And uh, the-the uh, wildness of the mores, which I think is-is mirrored in the wildness of Heathcliff's character.
Umm, well I would have to say that it's a, it's tragic love story.
Well, that's sort of a given, but yes. Anyone else?
Excellent! What Rachel has shrewdly observed here...
You completely stole my answer!
Noo! Maybe! I, I don't know. Ross, I still can't forgive you for what you did, I can't, I just, but sometimes when I'm with you I just, I feel so...
Oh, y-yeah, so, you-you love me!
Noo, nnnnn. What does this mean? What do you, I mean do you wanna, get back together?
What?!
I just, I feel, I-I just...
And if you need anything else, I do not believe we've met. Hi. I'm, uh, Rachel Green. I'm Carol's... ex-husband's... sister's roommate.
Hi, I thought you might like some ice chips.
Thanks.
It is nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Franzblau. I'm your roommate's... brother's... ex-wife's obstetrician.
Oh, that's funny!
Oh no! No! No-no-no-no! No, I mean come on that's-that's crazy-I mean that's crazy. So what's-what's going on with you? What is going on with you?
Ross thanks.
You want me to call her right now?
Well umm, oh! I might be teaching another class this semester!
Yeah do it now, call right now.
Terrible? Hell, I was in Greece! That was a nice hotel! Nice beach, met the nice people. Not to shabby for Rachel.
Oh Ross, come on! You just did what you had to do.
That's it? You're not mad? I mean, it must've been terrible.
So, what? That's it?
Well, yeah! We're cool. Totally cool.
Hey Ross? Umm, I just ran into Caitlin in the hallway and-and uh, you must be getting better at this flirting stuff than I thought.
Well y'know, we have 7 people and like 10 pizzas, what do you think?
I just, I thought Joey was there.
What do you mean?
Well, I don't get it, but she wanted me to give you her phone number.
Country club newsletter. My mother sends me the engagement notices for 'inspiration.' Oh my God! Oh my God, it's Barry and Mindy!
Oh. Right. ...Oh great.
What is it?
Barry who you almost...?
Barry who I almost.
Ohh! Lucky me! Oh my God! That is good news, Ross! I think that's the best news I've heard since Le Poo died!
That's crazy! You can't do that! What are you going to tell her? Oh God. Ohh, you already agreed to this, haven't you?
It's awful I know, I mean, I feel terrible but I have to do this if I want my marriage to work. And I do, I have to make this marriage work. I have too. But the good thing is we can still see each other until she gets here.
You have no idea what a nightmare this has been. This is so hard.
Oh yeah, really? Is it Ross? Yeah? Okay, well let me make this a just a little bit easier for you.
But I don't, hmm... Oh, who approved that order?! Well there is no Mark Robbinson in this office. Get me Mark on the phone!
Honey, honey, I'm sorry, I know it's our anniversary but I told you on the phone I don't have time to stop.
Okay, you don't have to stop, I'm invisible, I'm not here.
I love Mark. Do you know Mark?
Yeah!!
Oh, wait yes, but I can't eat too much. Paul is taking me out to dinner tonight, he said he has a big surprise planned.
Yeah!
Hey, and then lunch.
Oh wow. What, do you think maybe he's gonna tell you that he's gay?
What?! No! Why?!
Uhh, I mean this is like reading about my own life. I mean this book could have been called 'Be Your Own Windkeeper Rachel'.
Oh, God, oh, God, I mean it's just so.
Isn't it.
I don't think it would have sold a million copies but it would have made a nice gift for you.
Hey you guys.
"Oh my God, I can't find a boyfriend! So I guess I'll just stumble across the hall and sleep with the first guy I find in there!"
Hey! I call her!
"Oh my God, I love Ross! I hate Ross! I love Ross! I hate Ross!"
Yeah, we should get a move on if we wanna make those dinner reservations.
Still broken?
I am so sick of guys. I don't want to look at another guy, I don't want to think about another guy, I don't even want to be near another guy.
Oh, Ross...
What?
Huh.
Oh Ross, you're so great!
Because, I feel like I wouldn't just be going out with him. I would be going out with all of you. Oh, and there would just be all this pressure, and I don't wanna...
Uh, yeah. Uh, Monica, y'know, honey, I've been thinking about it and I've decided thisthis whole Ross thing, it's just not a good idea.
Oh, why?
No, no, no, no, no, no pressure, no pressure!
Monica, nothing has even happened yet, and you're already so...
Okay, um, I... All right Phoebe look, I just wanted to say that I'm sorry. OK? I handled the situation horribly and I should not have lied to you.
Hey Phoebe, can I talk to you for a second?
Sure
So, what should you have done?
Well, I-I should've told you the truth.
Oops, sorry. Listen, we-we have to have a party tonight! Actually, we have to have one in five minutes, so everybody cancel your plans.
Then uh, what's-what's this?
You need that, you need that too 'cause obviously, a thief could just tear this up.
What are you talking about?
Yeah, what' going on?
Joey, the new chair will be here in an hour. Maybe we should actually move Rosita out of here. Y'know, start the heeling process?
Francette? What is she? A couch?
Poor thing. Cut down in her prime.
Well, I guess you're right. Maybe, maybe I'll take her down to the incinerator. It's gonna be so said, and kinda cool. She's heeled!
That's weird.
I'll tell ya who should be embarrassed! It's you guys! Come on! This is ridiculous! Thank you very much, but I do not need you to get me a date!
I... Am I the only one that this is embarrassing for?
I'm a little embarrassed.
Then why did she ask us to...
I am still talking!! And then you chase away the one guy that I actually liked! I mean, no offense to you guys. Really! I mean congratulations on all the cash, and-and y'know--Wow! You do have very soft hair! But I would much rather go to the ball all by myself than go through anymore of this! Good-bye! Now do you use some sort of special conditioner on that hair?!
He is, isn't he? I don't know, I don't know, I mean maybe it's just being here at the beach together or, I don't know. But it's like something...
Monica, please?
He's totally flirting with you too.
Hey!
Hey! Hi Bonnie!
Well, I don't know. I called all the people in Monica's phone book and these are the only ones who could show up on 24 hours notice.
Yeah?
Who the hell are all these people?
Hmm, y'know there's another word for people like that. Losers!
Hi! I'm Rachel. This is Phoebe. I'm the maid of honor. How do you know Monica?
Well, ever since I was humiliated and yelled at in front of my friends, I'm just, I don't know, not in a museum benefitty kind of mood.
I'm not gonna gooo, so I think that will accomplish the not going.
Um, you know, just out of curiosity...
Right. Right, okay, okay. I'm sorry. I'm sorry I yelled.
It's fine.
Yeah. Y'know umm, uh, umm, about that, umm, Ross I really appreciate your offer to let me move in and everything, but don't you think it's gonna be weird?
Oh wow.
Yeah but, on the bright side, we get to be roommates again.
Wh-why?! Why-why-why would it, why would it be weird?
Well, because of us! Because of our history.
I didn't! Even when I found out...umm, all right, well let's just say I found something out something about someone and let's just say she's gonna keep it.
What an interesting approach to guitar instruction. Y'know some might find it amusing, I myself find it regular.
Hey everybody, Rachel was so good today. She didn't gossip at all.
Hey, Pheebs! Check-check this out.
Ooh, you nailed the Old Lady!
Wh... Come on! Remember? We were on the sleeping porch! We couldn't stop giggling? And our coconuts kept knockin' together?
How can you not remember us kissing?!
I don't know. I don't remember a lot of things that never happened.
Oh, somewhere Joey's head is exploding.
Yeah-but come on-Listen, I'm sorry I don't want to make you uncomfortable, but I told Phoebe that it happened and she doesn't believe me.
Look you guys, I have to go, I'm the Maid-of-Honor. And besides you know what I just need to be in a room again with these people and feel good about myself.
Because I promised Mindy I would.
Yeah, well you promised Barry, you'd marry him.
Ooh-oh! Someone's wearing the same clothes they had on last night. Someone get a little action?
I may have.
Yeah, we could. Oh hey look! There's some Kappa Kappa Deltas! I was a Kappa. Hey sisters! Wow, we really are bitches.
Well, we're a little early, the lecture doesn't end for 15 minutes.
Yeah, but y'know we could sneak in and watch.
Right! So when Rigby got his samples back from the laboratory he made a startling discovery! What he believed to be igneous, was in fact sedimentary. Imagine his consternation when- Oh bloody hell.
What the hell are you doing?!
Wow that's uh, juicy. Umm, y'know what though Mon, I actually do have a lot of work to do so if-if-are you sure there's just not anything else?
Nothing! You go!
Well, I-I-there was this guy at the bank that I thought was cute umm, but I don't anymore.
Yes, I'm sure! Rachel is there something that you want to talk me about?
No! If there was I wouldn't tell you.
BACK OFF!!! Get up! Get up! Get up! God damn it! Get up, get up, get up, get up, get up!!
What the hell is that?!! What the hell is that? Is that you? Ohhhhhhh!
Boy, you are really not a morning person.
What is that noise?
You!
Well y'know, some people make deals with a friend, like if neither of them are married by the time they're 40, they marry each other.
Yeah, I'm pretty confident about that. That's what makes it so easy for me to be 80% happy for Monica and Chandler! It would be nice to have a little guarantee though.
What do you mean?
You mean a backup?
Exactly!
Okay, two things didn't happen. Remember I told you that someone made out with Ralph Lauren in the copy room? Well, it turns out that's not true.
Yeah, remember that thing I told you that happened yesterday? Well it didn't happen.
You didn't cancel the fabric order from Taiwan?
That's not true?
No.
You know what else I'm not gonna miss? "I'm Monica. I wash the toilet 17 times a day. Even if people are on it!"
Ben, say hi to Aunt Monica. Oh, I guess he doesn't feel like talking right now. He's smiling though! Okay, talk to you later.
Yeah, I think it was better when you guys were sad. Hey, uh, remember the roller blades?
"Hi I'm Rachel, is my sweater too tight? No? Oh, I'd better wash it and shrink it!"
"I'm Monica, I don't get phone messages from interesting people. Ever!"
Y'know if what I do is so lame, then why did you insist on coming with me this morning? Huh? Was it so I just wouldn't go with Mark?
Oh, that is so...
No-no-no, a bunch of out of control jackets take over an island.
No. I... I wanted to be with you. I don't know, I feel like lately, I feel like you're slipping away from me, y'know. With this new job, and all these new people, and you've got this whole other life going on. I-I-I know it's dumb, but I hate that I'm not a part of it.
It's not dumb. But, maybe it's okay that you're not a part of it. Y'know what I mean? I mean it's like, I-I-I like that you're not involved in that part of my life.
But, they're across the hall! I mean that's two doors away, it would take them a long time to peck their way back over here.
Okay. So, can I serve you a little of-What? What? What?
Nothing I uh, it's just that I know that they're still out there.
Okay, that's-that's not funny. Uhh.
Okay, y'know, would you feel better if we went someplace else? I mean we could pack all this stuff up and y'know go to your apartment.
Boy, you really can't stand to lose, can you? Your whole face is getting red... little veins popping out on your temple...
Let me see! Show them!
Y'know, I've had dates like this.
Plus that shirt doesn't really match those pants.
First of all, I'm not losing...
Hey, y'know what? You're the one who wants to make this big change and move in with Chandler! You should be the one to go! Why should I have to leave?!
I'm not moving! Is that picture straight?
It needs to go about 20 blocks to the left!
Because it's my apartment!
Well it's mine too! What else you got?!
Come on you guys! Listen, if Emily knew I was here having dinner you with you she would flip out and you know it. It's okay, I really... I don't mind.
Yeah, y'know I-I think I'm just gonna hang out in my room.
No! Why?
Wait! Wait! Wait! Y'know what? Just stay. Please? It uh... It would really mean a lot to me if you stayed.
Ross, I...
So, I still have boxes here. I still have boxes at Ross's, and I have nowhere to live! Wow. I could so easily freak out right now.
Yeah!
It's got 'em!
What about me? I just found out that Denise is leaving town for a while, I don't have a roommate.
Well, maybe-maybe I could be your roommate Pheebs.
All right, how about I go over there and I will walk into Chandler's bedroom and I will see that thing that I think that I know is actually the thing that I think that I know!
Okay, fine.
You don't know!
YOU KNOW!!!!
AND YOU KNOW!!!
Since when do take naps in that position. Oh God Monica, tell me you were waiting for a guy! Please tell me you were waiting for a guy!
Hi! I just wanna--Ahhh!!! Oh my God! Oh my God!
Okay, I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I-I-I was um, I was taking a nap.
Yes. Yes, I was. A guy. From work. I'm seeing a guy from work! Ha!
That cute waiter guy from your restaurant, the one that looks like a non-threatening Ray Liotta?
Okay. It's okay. We're gonna be okay. Y'know what? It's okay. I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna boil some water and just rip up some sheets!
Yeah, I thought I had one a couple of minutes ago, and now I know that was definitely one.
Wait, you can't have the baby here! I mean I haven't sterilised it since the guys moved out!
No. It's all right; it's probably false labour. They said that, that can happen near the end, just somebody get the book.
Rachel, get the book! The book!
No. I have got to get ready and go to a dinner at my bosses house. It's a very big deal, there's a lot of people there I have to meet.
Look, I'm fine. Watch. Look at that. Whoa-whoa!
Okay, okay. Look, you have got to go to a doctor! Okay?
And I'm sure you're gonna make a big impression. Hi! I'm Rachel Green. It's nice to meet you. Come on, you probably have a broken rib!
Well, I will go to the hospital tomorrow, it'll still be broken then.
Okay, whoa-whoa easy there Melissa! This ain't a locker room, okay? But, y'know I remember him saying that-that he had plans tonight.
Really?! Got a little crush on Tag there do ya?
Well, we've been flirting back and forth, but I was hoping that tonight it would turn into something a little more than that.
Oh no!
Oh yeah. All right, back to work.
I'm sorry. Oh God, I'm sorry, it's just that when you moved your hands down to my butt, it was like woah, Ross's hands are on my butt. Sorry.
Mon.
What, what.
And that's, that's funny why?
Well it's not, honey I'm sorry, I guess I'm just nervous. I mean, it's you, ya know, it's us. I mean, we're crossing that line, sort of a big thing.
When I was um, 7, I crashed my bike right out in front of his house and to stop me from crying he kissed me right here.
Ya know, Dr. Burke kissed me once.
When?
Oh you are so lucky.
I know.
Daddy... Daddy... Daddy, why whyyy would I sleep with Billy Dreskin? His father tried to put you out of business! ...dead!
Would you excuse me for a second?
Remember back in freshman year? Well, Billy Dreskin and I had sex on your bed.
Ross, he's got the remote again.
Good. Maybe he can switch it back.
No Mon that's not the point. I'm out a thousand dollars, I'm all scratched up, and I'm stuck with this stupid cat that looks like a hand!
Well, they said would but they would only give me store credit. I mean, what am I going to do, get a thousand regular cats?
Look, if you want you can keep it at our place until you find out what to do with it.
Oh my God, the cat's made my eyes water! Don't-don't throw it to me! My vision's been compromised!! Oh God! Okay. Okay. It's okay. Man, that was close.
Yeah, you almost overreacted to something.
Oh God Monica hi! I just went to your building and you weren't there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are, you are!
And I just want a million dollars!
Rachel?!
Okay, everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor. This is everybody, this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my brother Ross?
Hi, sure!
He plays for the Yankees. Seriously, ESPN! Just once and a while, have it on in the background. Ooh, this one was Pierce Brosnan!
This one is uh Paul O'Neil.
Who's that?
Pierce Brosnan?
Uh-huh.
Okay! "Hello Ross, this is Dr. McNeeley from the Fake Accent University, we'd like you to come on board with us full time!
Really? Really?!
Yes!
Hey!
Hey!
No, no, I mean, no, c'mon you guys, I mean, c'mon look it's only eleven thirty. Let's just talk, we never just hang out and talk anymore.
Well, listen, this has been great but I'm officially wiped.
Me too, we should get goin'.
Rachel, that's all we do.
Maybe that's all we do, what about Julie?
Oh that's right. You're the talker. Anyway uh, great idea! Umm, I gotta go to the store; I told him that I would buy him some more tissues.
What's the other one?
I don't know, I've never had to use the other one. I'm just saying y'know, if we're having sex, he's not gonna be talking.
Oh, we have some...
No you don't!
I don't know! He hasn't called me since that one time when we went out. I see him in the hallway, we flirt, I'm all ha-ha-ha-ha, and nothing.
Two pounds of Moca Java please.
Danny. Are you guys ever gonna go out again?
Hey!
Hi Danny! Wow! Thirsty huh?
Oh, be home, be home, be home, be home, be home, be home. Be home. Be home, be home, be home. Oh, you're not home.
Oh, no, no.
What? Are you married? 'Cause that's okay.
Still no smile?
Touchet, touchet, Miss Americccan pie. Ameri-ccan.
Yeah, there was. It was-there the corner of the library where-where all these dusty books that nobody ever read-Yes, there was.
Oh my God! Did you get to see anything good?
Let me ask you something, at your school was there a like uh a place on campus where students went to uh, fool around.
Great! Because people kept showing up, I think it's like uh-a thing!
Now hold on a second, fifth floor against that back wall?
Oh come on, what are you talking about? You've got three years painting houses. Two whole summers at T.G.I. Friday's, come on!
That's your whole name, okay of course it is! Okay, well let's-let's just have a look-see here.
I know I haven't worked in an office before, and I really don't have a lot of experience, but uh...
It's lame, I know. But I'm a goal-oriented person, very eager to learn...
Okay, hold on just a second. I'm sorry, it's for human resources, everybody has to do it. Could you just stand up please?
Well, you know, honey, I don't think everybody gets Smelly Cat. You know, I mean, if all you've ever actually had are healthy pets, then, whoosh!
Do you?
No. This whole like playing-for-money thing is so not good for me. You know, I don't know, when I sang "Su-Su-Suicide", I got a dollar seventy-five. But then, "Smelly Cat", I got 25 cents and a condom. So you know, now I just feel really bad for Smelly Cat.
It's not even that. I used to do my songs because it made me happy, but now it's like, it's just all about the money.
Well, people missed you in there. And in fact, there was actually a request for "Smelly Cat".
Anyway, Ralph just came in to tell me that he's so happy with my work that he wants me to be the new merchandising manager for polo retail.
It's the same story.
Wow, it's really long.
Still get a discount on wedding dresses?
Yeah!
Go Monana! Well, you ladies are not the only ones living the dream. I get to go pour coffee for people I don't know. Don't wait up.
So once they caught on to the fact that we're, y'know, short and have breasts...
...They threw us out! I was thrown out of a hotel! Me!
Oh, by the way, tomorrow we're auditioning for a Broadway show.
'Scuse me?
Chip! Hi, it's Rachel. Rachel Green. Yeah, umm, you left me a message. Yes you did, my roommate wrote it down. Monica Geller. Ohh.
Okay. Are you sure you wanna hear this?
Oh, I'm sure.
Oh, that's right! He called to ask out Monica! That-that's gotta be embarrassing!
...DUMB, DRUNKEN, BITCH!!! Thank you, thanks.
Okay, thank you. That'll be all. Wait! Wait! Did you see that? That mail guy had no idea there was something going on between us.
Hi. Tag, I have a conference call today is that correct?
Yes, at 4:00.
I'd better get back to my desk.
Okay, you hard worker! I'll remember to put that in your evaluation.
Okay. Happy birthday Grandma! It's better to be over the hill then buried under it. All our love Monica and Chandler. That's funny, yeah!
Now that you're a couple, we don't get two presents from you guys?
For my last birthday you gave me a hug! Okay, read the card! Read the card!
No-no-no-no! That was the joke!
No, I know! I get it! It's funny!
Well y'know if you, if you started smoking again you could've at least told me! Come on, give me one of those! What are we talking about?
Yeah. That didn't work out.
Rachel we tried to quit, but it was too hard!
No. No! You're doing great! Don't you give up! That's why we didn't tell you and we're not gonna drag you down with us.
Oh wait, no-no-no! Drag me down. Drag-drag me down.
Y'know, like the thing when you put the phone in your pants? Tag! I'm serious! This isn't funny! Those contracts absolutely had to go out today!
Okay please tell me that this is just one of your jokes that you do that I don't get.
Like what?
Rach, I'm sorry, but you didn't give me any contracts!
Yes I did! And I put a little Post-It on it that said, "Must go out today," and underlined today three times and, and then I put a little heart in the corner because I didn't want to seem to bossy.
Jo-Joey, look honey we-we need to talk okay? Umm, I kinda got the feeling from her today that uh, she's not lookin' for a serious relationship.
No-no-no-no-no! It's a surprise, but it's gonna be tricky thought because she said she was gonna be pretty busy at work for a while.
Oh no, yeah.
Where are you gettin' this?
Well, she told me. She said she's kinda a loner.
I hate this apartment! I hate the color of these walls! I hate the fact that this place still smells like bird! I hate that singing guy!
HEY!! Do you have to do that? It's Saturday!
Oh come on! Morning's here! Morning's here! The morning is here! Sunshine is here!
Are you kidding? I love that guy! Morning's here! Morning is here-
Stop it! I will kill you. I hate the fact that my room is so small.
Uh, thank you Phoebe. Umm, well, what struck me most when reading Jane Eyre was uh, how the book was so ahead of its time.
Umm, Rachel and I were just discussing it and she had some very interesting insights.
Well, go ahead Rachel.
If you're talking about feminism, I think you're right.
Yeah, well, feminism yes, but also the robots.
Well, I have to be, I don't really have a choice, I mean, you know, I could look at the bright side, I get two birthday parties and two birthday cakes.
That's who.
Look, are you gonna be ok?
Well, actually just one birthday flan.
What?
Yeah. Yeah, and y'know you-you deserve to win. And-and y'know I was thinking about it, if-if you're Monica's maid of honor that means I get to be yours.
Hi! I just want to apologize. I'm really sorry I was a baby.
That's ridiculous Rachel, we were all babies once. Oh, you mean today.
Oh yeah!
Yeah! Oh, umm when-when Monica and Chandler got engaged I started putting some stuff together, y'know just in case...
Y'know honey, umm, as uh, as flattered as I am that uh, you saw me first, uhh, I just, I-I don't think we should be cranking anything up.
What are you saying?
I'm saying maybe you and I crank it up a notch.
I'll treat you real nice.
Yeah, well, y'know umm... No honey, listen I think it's a great idea to become friends with someone before you date them, but I think the way you do it is y'know you meet someone, become their friend, build a foundation, then you ask them out on a date. Don't hit on your existing friends!
Well, it doesn't sound like it! I mean, it's pretty easy not to kiss someone, you just don't kiss them! See look at us, right now, not kissing!
Shhhh!!!
Look, I uh, I tried not to kiss her, okay?
Let me finish, okay? She started kissing me and-and I didn't stop it. I guess I-I just wasn't thinking...
Yeah that's right you weren't thinking! Y'know what? Let me give you something to think about!
All right, listen, smirky. If it wasn't for you and your stupid balloon, I would be on a plane watching a woman do this right now. But I'm not.
Why do you guys have so many keys in there anyway?
For an emergency just like this.
I swear you said you had the keys.
No, I didn't. I wouldn't say I had the keys unless I had the keys, and I obviously didn't have the keys.
I accidentally kissed him in the interview, and now he wants me back y'know of course, 'cause "Let's bring the girl back who kisses everybody!"
Yeah! No?
A kiss? What are you talking about?
Come on, Rach.
Oh my God! What if he thinks I'm the kind of girl that-that would just sleep with him?
Ugh! I cannot believe Chip dumped me for that slut Nancy Branson. I am never going out with him again. I don't care how much he begs!
Oh! No, not really.
Well, that's cool. So did...
I think his begging days are over now that he's going out with Nancy Branson.
Y'know what? I've just had it with high school boys! They are just silly. Silly, stupid boys! I'm going to start dating men!
Oh Ross, come on! This is not, this is not a marriage!! This is the world's worst hangover! Ross, listen, if you do not get this annulment, I will!
Oh b-b-but it is!
Oh, okay, y'know what this is? This is a difference of opinion. And when that happens in a marriage...
All right. All right, I'll do it.
Thank you. Hey-hey umm, uh, is there, is there any such thing as an annulment shower?
Okay. Okay. Okay. Umm, maybe you can start with, "Chandler, even though we were friends; there was a part of me that always knew I wanted more."
Hi, I'm Ross's little sister.
Okay.
All right, there's a nuclear holocaust, I'm the last man on Earth. Would you go out with me?
Ennnh.
Excuse me, sir. Hi, you come in here all time. I was just wondering, do you think there's a possibility that you could give me an advance on my tips?
Rachel, Rachel, sweetheart. You're a terrible, terrible waitress. Really, really awful.
Ok, I, I hear what you're sayin'. I'm with you. Um, but I, but I'm trying really hard. And I think I'm doing better. I really do. Does anybody need coffee? Oh, look at that.
Huh?
Ok, ok, that's fine. Fine. Hey, I'm sorry about that spill before. Only $98.50 to go.
Yes! He has a naked picture of Monica! He takes naked pictures of us! And then he eats chicken and looks at them!
Joey has got a secret peephole!
Oh no! No! No! No!
Look!
Dude! That's my sister!
Ok, Monica. I just have to know one thing. Did you go with her to Bloomingdale's? Oh! Ok, ok, ok, I just really, uh, I just really need to not be with you right now.
Oh, so you just sort of happened to leave it in here?
Did it ever occur to you that I might just be that stupid?
Hi, who's this? Hi, Joanne. Is Rachel working? It's Monica. Yes, I know I did a horrible thing. Joanne, it's not as simple as all that, ok? No, I don't care what Steve thinks. Hi, Steve.
Hey!
Oh god. Oh, am I being like a total laundry spaz? I mean, am I supposed to use like one machine for shirts and another machine for pants?
Uberveiss. It's new, it's German, it's extra-tough.
Rach, do you uh, are you gonna separate those?
Rach, have you never done this before?
Well, not myself, but I know other people that have. Ok, you caught me. I'm a laundry virgin.
No, I have to go downstairs and come back up as if I'm coming home from the regatta gala. Okay? So just go distract him. But don't be sexy.
Shoot, shoot, this is never gonna work! He's right there!
Just go over and say hi.
Hey, Danny!
Hey! What's going on?
Wait a minute! Wait a minute! I'm not saying that you shouldn't have a bag, I just-it's just there are other bags that are a little less umm, controversial.
...I just don't know if the world is ready for you and your bag.
I can't believe I'm hearing this!
Yeah umm, they're called wallets.
Oh hey, you guys, look! Ugly Naked Guy is putting stuff in boxes!
I know you did! I bought the same one! And if she sees your table she's gonna know that I lied to her. I told her ours was an original.
Ross! Phoebe's gonna be here any second, she cannot see this!
Well why not?! She'll-she'll love it! It's the real thing! I got it at Pottery Barn.
Why did you do that?
Because she hates Pottery Barn.
Oh, come on now, don't keep me waiting. Get those clothes off! But, I would keep that helmet on because you're in for a rough ride!
Yeah that's right! Come on Joey; sex me up!
Hey-hey, you're startin' to sound like the butcher's wife there in-in chapter seven.
I don't want to, I'm scared.
Hey, you guys!
Yes, and I know that you'd say no if he asked you, but I'm sorry; how great would you look walking down the aisle in this Donna Carin.
Hi! Okay, don't be mad at me, but I couldn't resist.
Brides magazines?
Oh, you so would! Oh, you should get that anyway. Like for clubbing.
It is so weird, I know what I said, but uh, this morning, I was lying in bed I was, I was imagining what it would be like to say yes. I know it's a little sudden, and it's a little rushed, and it's totally not like me to do something like this, but that doesn't mean I can't. Right? I mean I'm-I'm crazy about Pete, and I know that we want the same things, and when I thought about saying yes, it made me really happy.
Wow! Oh-okay, look pal, I am not in the mood to be hit on right now! But if you give me your number I will call you some other time.
Fine! I'm sorry for your loss!
So uh, you're not gonna be able to live here for a while, you ladies have a place to stay?
Yes, they can stay with us.
Have you figured out what started the fire Mr. Fireman?
Okay, your band is playing at Arnold's, collect three cool points. Which means, I have five, and that means I get Joey's boxers!
All right, relax. It's just a shoe.
Wooooo!!!!
Fine. Gang up on me! I got you all right where I want you.
Come on, take 'em off!!
No, no, no, now wait, wa, wa, waa-it a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. That actually, uh, that sounds interesting.
You could drink the fat.
Hi, welcome, to an adult conversation.
What?
I think you should drink the fat.
The nights are the hardest. But then the day comes! And that's every bit as hard as the night. And then the night comes again...
Yeah-No-but-but-but-but! We're just gonna go home and take a shower. Now, that's not scary right?
Depends on what you mean by we.
The days and nights are hard! I get it! Okay? Look umm, Rachel I'm sorry! I have to start getting ready! I'm getting married today!
I know. At dusk. That's such a hard time for me.
Mmm-hmmm. Oh, so typical. Ooo, I'm a man. Ooo, I have a penis. Ooo, I have to win money to exert my power over women.
That's alright, I'll take it. Bad things happen to me anyway. This way I can break 'em up with a movie.
Well, that just leaves the big Green poker machine, who owes fifteen...
You know what? This is not over. We will play you again, and we will win, and you will lose, and you will beg, and we will laugh, and we will take every last dime you have, and you will hate yourselves forever.
Hmm. Kinda stepped on my point there, Mon.
Oh my God. Oh my God Ross, no, hang up the phone, give me the phone Ross, give me the phone, give me the phone, give me the. . .
Oh yeah, go ahead.
Rach, I got a message from you. Who's Michael?
You're over me?
Ohhhhhhhh God.
Yes oh--Do I want sugar in my coffee? No, just some milk would be good Carol. Thanks. Okay, do you remember all that stuff I taught you yesterday?
I found him! Very funny, come here! That is exactly why I've come here to talk to you okay?
Rach, do you want some sugar in your coffee?
Remember all that stuff I taught you yesterday?
Don't do that.
Oh that's all right! Y'know, I ended up having a really good time. Y'know, the charity was a big success and they raised a lot of money and awareness.
Call me!
Rachel, we're sorry for pushing those guys on you.
So what was it for anyway?
I wanna say a disease.
Well, I was going to, but then I figured, you know... you're food is so delicious and perfect, you can never have too many of those pumpkin things.
Oh, right. Sorry. But Tag's not coming; his girlfriend came into town, so he's spending Thanksgiving with her.
Oh! Why didn't you tell me? I made him his own individual sweet potato stuffed pumpkin.
Now you think I wouldn't enjoy that, because it is so fake, but I still do.
Regular Celery! Oh, I already have that.
Come on Joey, I just bought you a new chair! The most expensive one in the store! Hey, y'know what I was thinking? We could name her Francette.
Well look, if you don't like this...
I don't know why you say that so soon.
Francette? What is she? A couch?
Poor thing. Cut down in her prime.
Ross! Your honor, rest assured relationship ended like two years ago! And could you strike "Consummated like bunnies" from the record?
Ugh!
Now if you were two involved in a serious relationship, that really creates a problem.
Is there, anything in this record that is actually true?
Well, yes, we got married in Vegas and uh, and the names I think.
Yes, okay, oh, by the way, I just gotta say, I think it's really nice of you that even after you've moved, you still keep storing that stuff for Joey!
Ha!
Make sure you put all that stuff back in the closet, okay?
Hey-hey dancer girl! Can I go to the bathroom? I just.. Here we go. Looking good Gellers!
We know!
Oh, I don't know, I guess, Chris O'Donnel, John F. Kennedy, Jr., Daniel Day Lewis, Sting, and Parker Stevenson.
First, I need a boyfriend, then I can have a list.
It's just a game Mon. Rach, how about you?
Spiderman?
Hardy Boy.
Alright, I feel that this is totally unjustified. She gave me the green light, I did nothing but-. Do you think I can't see you in the TV set?
Hello. Oh hi, are you on your way ove-. Oh. No, no, I, I understand, I mean a monkey's gotta work. No it, it's no big deal, it' not like I uh, had anything special planned. Yeah OK, OK. OK, OK, bye.
OK, Rachel, why don't you start talking first.
Alright Monica, if there is something that you would like to share...
Ya know, you had no right to go out with him.
Oh, oh, and hey-hey-hey, those little spelling tips will come in handy when you're at home on Saturday nights playing Scrabble with Monica!!
Y'know I can't believe I even thought about getting back together again! We are so over!!
FINE BY ME!!
Hey!!
Sorry!! I just feel bad about all that sleep you're gonna miss wishing you were with me!
No Joey, look. Trust me, all the men are wearing them in the spring catalog. Look. See look, men, carrying the bag.
It's not a purse! It's a shoulder bag.
It looks like a women's purse.
See look, women, carrying the bag. But it is odd how a women's purse looks good on me, a man.
Exactly! Unisex!
Yeah. I'm-I'm telling you he's really sweet and he's really funny and he's just ugh, got a good heart. And besides, I y'know, I think he really likes you.
I know, I know, but uh just, I'm telling you, once, once you get past that part, that where it-it just feels like you wanna die, he's-he's really a good person.
The guy with the gas?!
Really?!
Well y'know, we have 7 people and like 10 pizzas, what do you think?
Yeah... ....OK. Where were we? Oh, OK... five card draw, uh... jacks or better... nothing wild, everybody ante.
Sorry, Rach.
Y'know, there's gonna be lots of other stuff.
Look, Rachel, we don't have to do this.
Yes, we do.
Well it's not, honey I'm sorry, I guess I'm just nervous. I mean, it's you, ya know, it's us. I mean, we're crossing that line, sort of a big thing.
I'm sorry. Oh God, I'm sorry, it's just that when you moved your hands down to my butt, it was like woah, Ross's hands are on my butt. Sorry.
And that's, that's funny why?
I, I know it's big, I just didn't know it was uh, ha-ha big.
OK.
Wow! I mean, I just-I can't, I can't believe this. Y'know, I mean you think you know someone even, even Phoebe who's always been somewhat of a question mark.
Well down at the adult video place down on Bleaker.
And-and I, and I saw that Joey was about to go in, so I ran in ahead of him to-to surprise him and, and then I pretended I didn't know he was in there.
This is so bizarre. I guess it kinda makes sense though, y'know she had such a terrible childhood.
Hey, I had a terrible childhood and I don't do porn.
Well said. And a uh good example of the fun I was referring to uhh, but I just think I'm past the point where I think I can y'know, just have fun.
Ohh Tag, umm...you're such a great guy and we have sooo much fun together but I don't-I don't...
Wait! I think I see where you're going, but before you say anything else, can I just say one more thing?
Rachel, don't do this. This is just because you're turning thirty.
Yeah, it is! But you're just a kid! I mean you're 25!
But, what you and I have is so much better. Ok, we have tenderness, we have intimacy, we connect. Ya know, I swear, this is the best I have ever had.
Ok, Ross, try to hear me. Ok, I, hey, I'm not gonna lie to you. Ok, it was good with Paolo.
Knock-knock.
Until now.
Oh, hi.
Ross, Ross, please listen to me. Ross, you are so much better for me than Paolo ever was. I mean you care about me, you're loving, you make me laugh.
Wow. Oh wow. You know I love you too, right.
Now I do.
Oh, hey, if I make you laugh, here's an idea, why don't you invite Paulo over and have a little romp in the sack and I'll just stand in the corner and tell knock-knock jokes.
God, Ross, look, what you and I have is special, all Paolo and I ever had was...
Don't just say yes! This isn't a game, Joey you can really get hurt out here. Okay, so do you want to pay attention or do you want to die?!
Okay, you just go on and make your little jokey-jokes, but if you do not know what you are doing out at sea you will die at sea. Am I getting through to you sailor?!
Yes.
I want to make a ship to shore call to Chandler.
All right, I definitely taste nutmeg.
Oh, yeah. And uh, the best part though, when the uh, waiter spilled water down my back, I jumped up, and my boob popped out.
What's up with Gene?
So, you wore your nightie to dinner?
Oh my God!
Oh, no!
Yeah, but it was different with him today! And he wasn't, like, Orthodontist Guy, y'know? I mean, we had fun! Is there anything wrong with that?
Rachel, what's going on? I mean isn't this the same Barry who you left at the altar?
Duh, where've you been?
Yes!
Why?
Hmm. Look, Ross, if you want your neighbors to like you, why don't you just pay the hundred bucks? The party's gonna cost you way more than that.
...so then President Steve told everyone that I was a cheapskate, and now the whole building hates me! A little kid spit on my knee! Y'know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna throw a party. That's right. For everyone in the building, and I'm gonna sit them down and explain to them, I am not a bad guy. I am not a cheap guy! I'm just a guy who-who stands up for what he believes in. A man with principles.
Sounds like a fun party.
It doesn't matter! It's my principles! We're talking about my principles!
Okay, I thought it was about your neighbors liking you.
I don't know, I don't know, weren't you the guy that told me to quit my job when I had absolutely nothing else to do. Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!!
Hey-hey-hey that's funny! Your funny Chandler! Your a funny guy! You wanna know what else is really funny?!
Something else I might have said?
Sweetie, calm down, it's gonna be okay.
No, it's not gonna be okay Ross, tomorrow is my last day, and I don't have a lead. Okay, y'know what, I'm just gonna, I'm just gonna call Gunther and I'm gonna tell him, I'm not quitting.
Ok, I know this is gonna sound really stupid, but I feel that if I can do this, you know, if I can actually do my own laundry, there isn't anything I can't do.
Janice. Hi, Janice. Ok, here we go. I don't think we should go out anymore. Janice.
All right. Well, there you go. Stop it, stop it, stop it.
That does not sound stupid to me. You know, it's like the first time I had to make dinner for myself, after Carol left me? I'm sorry, that's all the time we have. Next on Ross... Uh-oh.
What uh-oh?
Ya know, I just, so weird. I mean I was in there just listening to them bitch about each other and all I kept thinking about was the fourth of July.
This is it, isn't it? I mean, this is what my life is gonna be like. My mom there, my dad there. Thanksgiving, Christmas. She gets the house, he's in some condo my sister's gonna decorate with wicker. Oh, Chandler how did you get through this?
Well, I relied on a carefully regimented program of denial and, and wetting the bed.
Becasue it reminded you of the way our forefathers used to bitch at each other?
It's just this thing. Every year we would go out on my dad's boat and watch the fireworks. Mom always hated it because the ocean air made her hair all big. My sister Jill would be throwing up over the side and my dad would be upset becasue nobody was helping and then when we did help he would scream at us for doing it wrong. But then when the fireworks started, everybody just shut up, you know, and it'd get really cold, and we would all just sort of smush under this one blanket. It never occured to anybody to bring another one. And now it's just...
Hey! You...can't...leave Joey! You agreed to buy that boat, all right?! That is a contract! And plus if you leave, my boss is gonna kill me!
That's good. Very good!
So uh listen, I think I'm gonna take off now.
Well, what am I gonna do Rach?! I don't have that kind of money!
I know. Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. All right, this is what we're gonna do, we are gonna go to the next highest bidder, and we are just gonna let them buy it, and then you're just gonna pay the difference.
Yeah, who's gonna eat all our food, and tie up our phone lines, and - is that my bra? What the hell you doin' with my bra?
I know you're just moving uptown but I'm really gonna miss you.
I know, how can you not be accross the hall anymore.
Oh no-no, it's uh, it's not what you think. We uh, we used it to, you know, fling water balloons off the roof. Remember that, those junior high kids couldn't even get theirs accross the street.
Yeah, I remember.
Oh, well, that shouldnt be so hard, now that youre dating. "Sweetheart, youre fired, but how bout a quickie before I go to work?"
Congratulations, I think youve found the worlds thinnest argument.
Im just trying to find the right moment, you know?
Hey.
Hey.
Huh. Well, y'know that's actually a really good idea, because that way they'll be closer to the mugs. Y'know what, you should have the other waitresses do that too.
Gunther, Gunther, please, I've worked here for two and a half years, I know the empty trays go over there.
What if you put them here.
They already do. That's why they call it the 'tray spot.'
Gee, I always heard them talk about that, I just always thought that it was a club they went to. Oh God, I'm, I'm sorry.
Right,.. well,.. we never actually got to that... Oh, it was just so nice to see him again, y'know? It was comfortable, it was familiar... it was just nice!
Then we took a walk down to Bendall's, and I told him not to, but he got me a little bottle of Chanel...
That's nice... now, was that before or after you told him to stop calling, stop sending you flowers and to generally leave you alone, hmm?
That's, that's nice twice!
Rachel, what's going on? I mean isn't this the same Barry who you left at the altar?
Wow. Is it, is it 'cause she's so cold in bed. Or, or is it 'cause she's like, kinda bossy, makes it feel like school?
Why? Who's not having. . . Are you and Julie not, are, are you and, are you and Julie not having sex?
Technically, huh, no.
No, no, she's great and it's not like we haven't done anything. I mean, uh, uh, we, we do plenty of other stuff, lot's of other stuff, like uhh. . .
No, no no no, don't need to know the details.
What do you think Monica mean when she said she didn't want to talk, especially with me? I mean, why not especially you and me? We were both out there kissing.
Hey.
Hey, I just realized we kinda let some stuff up in the air...
Still thinking about it huh?
Come on! Serious-ser-ser-seriously, what did she mean by that? Especially you!
Oh, please, Ross it was so obvious! It was like you were marking your territory. I mean you might have well have just come in and peed all around my desk!
You're hurt!
...can't, can't a guy send a barbershop quartet to his girlfriend's office anymorrrrre!!
I would never do that!
Look, I know what's going on here, okay, Mark explained it all to me. He said this is what you guys do.
I just can't believe this is happening. I mean, when I was little, everybody's parents were getting divorced. I just figured as a grownup I wouldn't have to worry about this.
In my day, divorce was not an option.
Hey, look who's up.
Is there any chance that you can look at this as flattering? I mean, she's doing it because she wants to be more like you.
Well, then, you know, couldn't she have just copied my haircut?
Yeah. Look Joey, it's enough all right?! You keep making these stupid jokes and this sleazy innuendoes and it's-I'm not-it's just not funny anymore!
Do you even know what a vicar is?
Like a goalie, right?
All right, I'm sorry. Rach I-Rach I'm sorry. Okay? I'm sorry! Maybe I can make up for it by, taking you roughly in the barn.
All right! Y'know what? That's it! You wanna do it?! Let's do it!
You have! Ross, you should give yourself credit. I mean my Mom never thought this would work out. It was all, "Once a cheater, always a cheater."
Ooh, I was soo nervous about that letter. But the way you owned up to everything, it just showed me how much you've grown. Y'know?
I suppose.
Umm-hmm.
Ooh, I just wish we hadn't lost those four months, but if time was what you needed just to gain a little perspective...
Uh, OK, I mean uh, what, how are you gonna handle it. I mean, are, are ya gonna, are ya gonna talk about it before hand, are you just gonna pounce?
Oh, well, are hey, are you nervous?
Um, no, I uh, I have done it before.
I uh, I don't know, I guess I'm just gonna see, see what happens.
OK, gook luck.
Yeah, I know, I know, I know he does. But I have to tell him how I feel! He deserves to have all the information and then he can make an informed decision.
Yeah, that didn't work.
I-Rachel, you can't go! Ross loves Emily!
That's not why you're going! You're going because you hope he's gonna say, "Yeah, I love you too, Rach. Forget that British chippy."
Ohh-Do you think he will?!
'Cause I am really happy about us. I think we are, I think we are so on the right track! Y'know? I mean, I think we are working, I think we are clicking. Y'know?
I'm more than okay, I am really, really happy! Wanna know why?
Do I?
Yeah, sure-sure, yeah, we're-we're-we're-we're-we're clicking.
Yeah-yeah, y'know if-if there was just like one little area where I-that I think we need-we would need to work on; I-I would think it was we're just not crazy enough!
No-n-n-n-no! I am finally thinking clearly. My lucky dress wasn't working out to well for me, but for four years, this baby never missed.
But, we can't go now. It looks like Rachel's gonna put on a skit.
Oh my God! Have you lost your mind?
Rachel-Rachel-Rachel I-I cannot, I can't let-, actually I kinda want to see what happens.
Hey!
Sorry. I'm so exited! I've been waiting for this for months! I got my hair coloured! I got new sheets! I'm making him a very fancy meal.
Hey, Mon, if you were hoping to sleep with Joshua the first time tonight, which one of these would you want to be wearing.
Y'know what? It really creeps me out choosing other people's sex clothes.
Um-hmm.
What am I making him by the way?
Look, I know you guys heard about the whole thing with me and Ross but y'know, I've been obsessing about it all day and I'd just love not to talk about it. All right?
Hey.
Hey.
I-I-I don't know if this falls under this category, but uh, Ross is right back there.
That's not Ross!
That was you?! We heard about you in Junior High! Did you really just shake your fist in the air and shout, "I will be revenged?!"
Or Carol! But they're funny to kids and who is it hurting?!
Uh, y'know what? I'll tell you who it hurts! It hurts the kid who has all his clothes stolen in gym class so he has to go to the principal's office wearing nothing but a catcher's mitt!
I will be! Listen, I don't want you teaching my son that stuff anymore. Okay?
Fine. Fine, but I'll have you know that once I taught him that stuff he called me Fun Aunt Rachel. And I loved being Fun Aunt Rachel but I'll go back to being Boring and Uncomfortable Aunt Rachel if that's what you want!
Oh, I forgot this was in here. Umm, this was the uh garter that I was saving for my wedding and I wanted it to be Monica's something borrowed and it's blue. Yeah...
And umm, vintage handkerchiefs y'know 'cause, people cry at weddings. I'm just gonna grab a couple of these.
This stuff is great!
Y'know Rach, I think that, I think you should be Monica's made of honor.
You do? Why?
Well, Joshua's coming in tomorrow and since I don't have the guts to ask him out, I'm going to sell him a coat and put this note in the pocket.
Oh, wait-wait! Maybe it's a pickle?!
What are you writing?
Oh yeah? Joshua, give me a call sometime, guys like you never go out of style-what did you throw away?
Hi guys!
Noo, I y'know I don't see why she has to play with you, that's all. I mean doesn't she have any y'know other stripper moms friends of her own?
Oh.
Are you jealous?
You are totally jealous.
I'm not jealous. All right this is about, umm, people feeling certain things y'know about strippers. And y'know, and um, I...
If anybody asks, I'm your sister, Joan. Listen. C'mon, you guys. Ross said my name up there that obviously means that he still loves me!
Ross said my name. Okay? My name.
How did you get in here?
Your sister Joan is crazy.
Y'know what? Fine, I don't care. Don't believe me, I know I'm right-do you guys want to go downstairs and get a drink?
Uh-huh! Nice try, but you don't get that chair anymore! All right? That is my chair now! You can sit on my lap! No I take that back!
No Joe, no miracle.
Oh no this is devastating! My faith is shaken. I'm so glad I have the new chair to get my through this difficult time in my life.
I think I should get the chair!
How do you figure?
Maybe it, maybe it doesn't have to be this tough. I mean, maybe you were on the right track with this whole, you know, spontaneous thing. I mean, women really like that.
I know, yeah, sorry.
What, it's not your fault.
Really?
Yeah, I mean, you know it, I mean, if it were me I, I, you know, I'd want you to, I don't know, like catch me off guard, you know, with like a really good kiss, you know really, sort of um, soft at first, then maybe um brush the hair away from my face, and look far into my eyes in a way that let's me know that something amazing is about to happen.
What are you talking about, Ross, you just said that you read it twice! Look, y'know what, either it does or it doesn't, and if you have to even think about it...
Does it?
Does it? Does it? Yeah, I wanted to give that whole 'Does it?' part just another glance.
No, Rach, no. I don't, I don't, I don't have to think about it, in fact, I've decided, I've decided that, that it.......does.
Are you sure?
Yeah, you got like 14 hours until she has to be at the airport, and you're sitting here in the hallway with a 28-year-old cheerleader with a fat lip.
Ross, that girl just spent the entire evening talking to your friends, asking to hear stories about you, looking through Monica's photo albums, I mean you don't do that if you're just in it for two weeks.
You think?
Hey, you're right.
Yeah.
No. No. Every thing's--they're fine. Great pizza. But it's uh, actually umm my friend Ross. He uh, just gets really nervous when he's flirting.
Hey! Hey! Hi! Hey-hey-hey, I'm Rachel! From upstairs? The ones with all the pizza?
Oh, is there a problem?
Oh my God! That was flirting?!
Yeah.
Well, I mean, do you think you can ever have both? Y'know? Someone who's like, who's like your best friend, but then also can make your toes curl?
Oh, I don't know. I guess it's not about no guys, it's about the right guy, y'know? I mean, with Barry, it was safe and it was easy, but there was no heat. With Paolo, that's all there was, was heat! And it was just this raw, animal, sexual...
Wait-wait. I, I got it. I was there.
Yes. Yes. Yes! Yes, I really do! In fact, it's funny, very often, someone who you wouldn't think could-could curl your toes, might just be the one who...
Hi.
Well, yeah, y'know how Ross and I were on again, off again, on again, off again? I guess I just figured that somewhere down the road, we would be on again.
And I-I am just trying to figure out why.
Any luck?
Again. Y'know what? I think we all did.
Hey!
I can see that. I... just one phone call, I'll be very quick, I'll even pay for it myself. OK, you're bein' a little weird about your phone.
Hi, I'm sorry, I need to borrow your phone for just one minute.
I'm talkin'!
Alright, fine. I'll call you back.
Thank you. OK. Machine. Just waiting for the beep.
Ross, didn't you ah, play soccer in High School? Oh no wait, that's right. You just organized their game schedules on your Commodore 64.
So, did you play in college? sweatshirt he's wearing.)
Oh, I still do. Next year, I hope to make varsity though.
Well, it's getting late, I've got to get to the game, so I'm gonna... head.
Okay. I'll miss you.
Did, did he just, did he, did he just say, he said bye. He said bye. You said, you said bye to me. You said bye to me.
Bye Ben.
Bye.
Suddenly I'm seeing him go off to college.
We've gotta go, we've got that cab waiting.
Would you like to go to a basketball game with me? You know, its funny, basketball, because I happen to have tickets too... Umm, who likes the Knicks-
Whoa-whoa, that-that was just a theory! There's a lot of theories that didn't pan out. The lone gunman. Communism. Geometry.
Oh my God!!
What do you think?
Oh! Well, as a single woman, who is available, I think you look great!
Oh no, my dad's a doctor and he would always tell me just horror stories......about ghosts and goblins who totally supported the princess's right to smoke.
I don't know which one, but I do know I need a cigarette. So what do you say we take a break, we go outside, and we'll figure this out when we come back?
Rachel? Do you smoke?
...and then they came back from smoking and they had made all of the decisions without me!
That doesn't seem fair.
Oh God Monica hi! Thank God! I just went to your building and you weren't there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are, you are!
And I just want a million dollars!
Rachel?!
Can I get you some coffee?
De-caff. Okay, everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor. This is everybody, this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my brother Ross?
No, I know, they're from me. Look you guys this is not good. I mean we have enough trouble with guys stealing our wind without taking it from each other.
Here are your cakes.
We didn't order cake.
You're right.
You know.
Oh wow. Why don't we just take me and put me with a Manhattan in my hand, talking to the cute bartender. These pins aren't for playing are they?
So that's two of my wives.
Okay so this is where the band is. And this is where the bar is. And all these pins have people's names on them. And Rach, here you are.
Okay, the red ones are my guests and the blue ones are yours.
This is so sad. I mean, I only have like ten pins.
You see, now, I would date this girl. She's cute, she's outdoorsy, you know, and she knows how to build a fire. I mean, that's got to come in handy
Oh, yeah. Aw, remember the days when you used to go out to the barn, lift up your shirt, and bend over?
Yeah.
Okay, I've got a question. If you had to pick one of us to date, who would it be?
I don't know.
All right listen umm, I just bought something I'm not sure she's gonna like it, and it's gonna seem a little crazy, but this is something that I wanted since I was a little girl.
Is Monica here?
No.
You bought Shawn Cassidy!
Noo! I wish! Okay, you ready?
Yeah, ohh! Why, damnit, why did I open my mouth? I have a crush on you; I am attracted to you. Gee, I-I know that I freaked him out
I hate America! When I finish this game, I swear I am moving.
Hey! Tag's still talking to the police.
If you said it like that, you probably did, yeah.
Hey, is Chandler here?
Pheebs, you go with Monica and try on her green dress. If that doesn't work, you can wear my gray silk one. Oh, gosh, what am I wearing?!
Oh, great. It's starting to rain, that will make it easy to get a cab.
It was Michelle. It was definitely Michelle.
You don't, you don't know what your wearing?
Well, hon-ey. I'm just trying to look nice for your big night.
Oh God! Y'know what I wish? I wish you were six years older. Well actually, if I'm wishin' for stuff, I actually wish I was six years younger.
Yeah, it is! But you're just a kid! I mean you're 25!
Twenty-four actually.
Me too.
Yeah, I'm sorry.
You had no right coming down to my office Ross. You do not bring a picnic basket to somebody's work! Unless maybe they were a park ranger!
I was gonna give you a chance to apologise to me.
For what? For letting you throw me out of your office?
Yeah, well excuse me for wanting to be with my girlfriend on our anniversary, boy what an ass am I.
But I told you, I didn't have the time!
No Ross!! Don't! You can't just kiss me and think you're gonna make it all go away, okay? It doesn't work that way. It doesn't just make it better. Okay?
That is neither here nor there.
Okay, well here we are. Now we're in a tough spot again, Rach. What do you want to do? How do you want to handle it? Huh? Do you wanna fight for us? Or, do you wanna bail? Look, I, I did a terrible, stupid, stupid thing. Okay? And I'm sorry, I wish I could take it back, but I can't. I just can't see us throwing away something we know is so damn good. Rachel, I love you so much.
Okay, okay, okay.
I think you should go.
Oh, Ross, you had to, I mean, he was humping everything in sight. I mean, I have a Malibu Barbi that will no longer be wearing white to her wedding.
And the fact that they're both monkeys.
Sometimes I wonder if I did the right thing, ya know, giving him away.
Remember when sometimes he'd borrow your hat, and, and when you got it back there'd be little monkey raisins in it.
Yeah, well sure, when he did it, it was funny. When I did it to my boss's hat. . . all of the sudden I have this big attitude problem.
Oh-ho, my God! That was so awesome! You totally got him back for calling you fat! He was just drooling all over you. That must've felt so great!
Dude!
Sorry.
Well it didn't!
What?!
Yeah, well Betty's kinda sad. Which is why I believe I can lure her away with these chocolates. Now, while I distract her, you get in the office.
Okay, I think we can get the evaluation back before they see it, but we're gonna have to get into Mr. Zelner's office. Now, he doesn't get in until 10, so he's no problem, but his assistant, Betty, she comes in early to eat her breakfast at her desk.
That's kinda sad.
Got it!
Let's roll!
Yeah, well, word of advice: Bring back the comedian. Otherwise next time you're gonna find yourself sitting at home, listening to that album alone.
Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket.
The problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter how great the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y'know? I mean, we're in the car, we're fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake.
....Are we still talking about sex?
No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem a little angry?
Okay, you're coming with me, and I also told them that if we're still here when they get off that we'll go down to the cafeteria and have some Jell-O with them.
What?
Harder than it sounds. Isn't it?
Yep! There's always room for Jell-O...
Joey, how do you make that dirty?
"...marenge, thank you honey, and do the cha-cha. And while she like to be a star, Tony always tended bar. At the, wait, wait, everybody.."
Ya, know what Barr, I'm not gonna leave. I probably should, but I'm not, see 'cause I promised myself that I would make it through at least *one* of your weddings . See now, tonight, all I really wanted was to make it though this evening with a little bit of grace and dignity. Well , I guess we can all agree that's not gonna happen. There's nothing really left to say except.... "Her name was Lola. She was a showgirl. With yellow feathers , feathers in her hair, and a dress cut down to there. She would..."
Marenge,
Everybody!
At the Copa, Copa Cabana The hottest spot north of Havana. At the Copa, Coo-pa Ca-ban-a, music and fashion were always the passion, at the Copa....
Okay, you know what? I don't have it, but I can tell you exactly where it is on my night stand, and...okay. But you know what? I have my drivers license and I have a twenty.
Ohh, okay, how about five. Ohh, thank you.
I'm just going to need to see your passport.

Look, face it, my father is not going to pay for the build-in barbecue and believe me you can kiss you gazebo goodbye. Now I might be able to get you the new lawn.
Just a touch. Mon, I don't understand. I mean, you've been dating this guy since like, what... his midterms? I mean, why all the sudden are you so... Oh.
Ooh.
Windows are clean, candels are lit. Uh, belt's to tight, gotta change the belt. Did I turn the fish? No, cause I made lasagne. Am I out of control?
What?
Could tonight be the Night?
You guys, I'm telling you, when she runs, she looks like a cross between Kermit The Frog and The Six Million Dollar Man.
Okay.
Okay. Come on! That's not running! Let's go!
Monica had such a crush on him. Yeah, she used to kiss his poster every night before she went to bed.
Oh! I used to do that too!
Okay! Y'know what? I realized it was stupid to get upset about not having a husband and kids. All I really needed was a plan. See I wanna have three kids...
Well, I feel fine, but I think you're bumming out the rest of the kids.
What?
Oh let me guess, and you wanna have them all at the same time and you wanna have them for your brother.
As I was saying... I should probably have the first of the three kids by the time I'm 35 which gives me five years. I love this plan! I wanna marry this plan!
I don't care! All right, y'know what I'm just upset that I'm getting nowhere with Joshua that-y'know what still, you do not meet someone and go flitting off to Vermont!
Okay, I'm going to go stand over there.
Why do you care so much anyway?
Well, when you first met Barry, you flitted off to Vail.
Oh, y'know, would you just for once, not remember every...little...thing!!
Y'know what, just give me a second and I'll be out of your hair. I'm just gonna grab a jacket. When I get back, I want every little detail. Maybe that's him.
That cute waiter guy from your restaurant, the one that looks like a non-threatening Ray Liotta?
Uh-huh, that one!
Okay, umm, okay, umm... It's just Joey and Ross.
Why aren't you guys at the movie?
I know, I mean, why can't parents just stay parents? Why do they have to become people? Why do they have... Why can't you stop staring at my breasts?
Of course, course one of 'em's Ma. What's the matter with you.
It's like if you woke up one day and found out your dad was leading this double life. He's like actually some spy, working for the C.I.A. That'd be cool.... This blows!
What? What?
Did you not get a good enough look the other day?
Are you, are you, are you sure it's ah, a new bump? I mean, no offense, I've always thought of Ben as a fairly bumpy headed child.
They have a kid together, y'know. They're like, they're like a family, and if, I don't know, there's chance they could make that work, I know I wouldn't want to be the guy who stood in the way of that. Are you okay? Do you wanna ah, come poke a nude guy?
Well, he's finally alseep. About that ah, bump on his head?
It's okay if he bumps his head, kids bump their heads all the time, y'know, it was your first time babysitting, I figured you did the best you could.
I did!
Oh. I'm sorry. I'm very sorry. Sorry. It's just, I'm ahh, I'm kinda excited. I'm, ahh, going to London to ahh, tell this guy that I love him and...
Yeah?
If you're planning on doing that throughout the entire flight. Please tell me now. So that I could that a sedative...or perhaps slip you one.
Well I've-I've never done that with you before.
Nope.
Ah that's great. No actually that's... That's great! That's really great! Y'know, I gotta tell ya writing, I mean writing, gets me uh, gets me kinda hot.
Hi. I'm back.
Hey! I have so much more to tell ya, I've written it all down!
Wait! Wait! Listen! Listen to this! Y'know what I wanted to be when I was that age?
A lover?
Okay, Ross, Phoebe is my girlfriend, okay, we tell each other everything. You know, I mean, come on, guys do the same thing, I mean, what about all that locker room stuff.
Okay, who are you talking to when you do that?
Look, that was supposed to be like a private, personal thing between us.
That's different, okay. That's like, uh 'Who dated a stripper?' or 'Who did it on the back of the Staton Island Ferry?'.
Were both of those Joey?
...see I can't decide whether it would go better next to the new wicker dining chair, the Sahara desk, or the Parker console table.
We didn't give you any money!
You don't think I know that!
Wow! I didn't know that there was a Pottery Barn up here.
I know, I know. I went a little crazy.
Umm, listen, I'm gonna need to take a rain check, my roommate is just really sick. Okay? Bye! Honey, listen, I know, I know things seem so bad right now.
Y'know what Ross? You're not going anywhere. You're gonna sit right here. I'm gonna make you a cup of tea and we're gonna talk this thing whole out. All right? Hey, Dave!
Yeah?
Rach? Can I talk to for just a minute? I-I dropped some socks.
Yeah.
Oh, y'know I'm not that much of a sweet tooth. I--Wow. My God, so creamy. Oh my God, this is the best cheesecake I have ever had. Where did you get this?
Hi.
Hey, you have got to try this cheesecake.
It was at the front door. When I got home. Somebody sent it to us.
Chandler, this is not addressed to you. This is addressed to Mrs. Braverman downstairs. Thief.
All right, okay, Laurie proposes to Jo, and she says no, even though she's still in love with him, and then he ends up marring Amy.
Joey! I can't believe you just did that!
I can't believe she cracked your code!
Hey! Mine was by accident! All right, the boiler explodes and destroys the hotel, and kills the dad.
Eh. Beth dies.
Well yeah, but then I remembered I started it and there was this pep rally and I was, I was on top of the pyramid but anyway-umm, what is this book about?
So Pheebs, what is the book about?
I thought you said you read it in high school.
Okay, umm, it's this tragic love story between Cathy and Heathcliff and umm, it takes place on like these really creepy mores in England. Which I think represents the wildness of Heathcliff's character. I totally get symbolism.
How would you characterize the theme of this book, uh let's see here , Rachel Green?
Okay, he's a, he's a black capuchian monkey with a white face... ...with, with Russian dressing and, and pickles on the side. Okay. Thanks.
Okay, thank you, Mr. Heckles.
You owe me a waffle.
Hey. How did, uh, how'd it go today?
Great! It went great. Really great. Hey, is that wine?
I'm great! I'm great. I've got a great job at Bloomingdale's, have wonderful friends, and eventhough I'm not seeing anyone right now, I've never felt better about myself.
Hello, Chip.
Hey, Rach! How ya doin'?
So ah, Monica ready yet?
She'll be out in a second. So, Chip, how's umm, Amy Welch?
You know what, it's feeling a lot better, thank you, um... Well, listen, why don't you two sit down and, and we'll get you some glasses... okay... STAT!
It's uh...
..well, why don't you tell them? After all it, is your ankle.
Okay, listen, I'm thinking, why don't we just tell them who we really are? I mean, it'll be fine, I really think it'll be fine.
It will not be fine. We'll get in trouble.
Oh but you could. You can. Absolutely! We can help each other out! We can get--what are those--those patches! We could be like the Patch Sisters!
It does sound appealing.
Oh, I never could do it.
Oh y'know, we really should quit. Okay, let's quit!
Yes! Great! Give me those cigs! Give it! Give it!
Oh..Go..Oh..and I told my boss that someone made out with Ralph Lauren. If she finds out that I lied to her, she is going to hate me even more. Phoebe!!
Oh My God, Phoebe, that's not Ralph Lauren. That's Kenny the copy guy.
What?
Why would the copy guy say he was Ralph Lauren?
To get you to make out with him!!!
Ohh, God! Look at him, he's so cute. I wanna go over there, grab him, and kiss him! How can I kiss him and not letting him know that I like him?
And lucky means, more cleavage?
Does for me.
Oh! I know how you can get him, take off your bra.
What?
Okay, no, that's not the right decision. That's not, that's not right, no Ross-Ross, come on! I mean, that woman made you miserable! Okay, Ross, do you really want to get back into that?
Okay. Thank you! Thank you! Because-I'm sorry, all right. Because y'know what? She didn't want me-not important. The point is, I was right. Your decision. Okay? I was right. Your decision.
Right. I guess, I guess I should call Emily.
Okay, look, yesterday I would've even considered calling her back, but my ex-wife calls on the same day I have a near death experience. I mean, that-that has got to mean something!
Ugh, Ross! That was not a near death experience! That was barely an experience!
Yes okay. Well now see this isn't telling us anything. Joe. Carlos. Peter. Ooh! Peter Luger! T hat's a steak house!
Okay no way, you cannot use that to get the cute guy and the last blueberry muffin.
Did I use that already today? I'm sorry.
Okay, a meat eater. Fine, that's one for you.
Oh, I win! He's got Barney's on his speed dial.
Alright, don't tell me, don't tell me! Decaf cappucino for Joey.. Coffee black.. Late.. And an iced tea. I'm getting pretty good at this!
That's ridiculous!
Can I use.. either thumb?
Yeah. Yeah, excellent.
Good for me!
Joey, just-just he-he's new in town and I know he doesn't have any guy friends. Just take him to like a ball game or something. I'll really appreciate it.
I'm not asking you to go on a date with him!
Really? 'Cause I could kinda use the money.
Yeah, okay.
Yeah?
The whole night was horrible, it was pouring down rain, and when I got there, there was no Rachel Green on the list, but there was a Rachel Greep.
What?
Why?
Ohh! So, did you get to meet her?
No, there is no Rachel Greep, but then this other girl overheard us and she was all, "I'm Rachel Greep! I'm Rachel Greep!" and he let her right in.
Oh God. No! Oh not again! This-this happened when my grandfather died. It's ugh! Sorry. Oh, okay, so I'm sorry, what-what were you-what did you want to tell me?
What?
You're nose is bleeding!
Umm...
Sorry. Sorry.
That is not a tattoo, that is a nothing. I finally got her back in the chair, bairly touched her with a needle, she jumped up screaming, and that was it.
What're we looking at? That blue freckle?
OK, that's my tattoo.
OK, hi. For your information this is exactly what I wanted. This is a tattoo of the earth as seen from a great distance. It's the way my mother sees me from heaven.
Oh, what a load of crap. That is a dot. Your mother is up in heaven going, 'Where the hell is my lily, you wuss?' OK, Phoebe, that is not a tattoo, this is a tattoo.
All right, look, here's the bottom line Ross, this is fixable, if we act fast, okay. So, I'll invite him to brunch tomorrow and you can make nice.
Um. yeah.
I am soo dead.
Look, honey, I have tried to make nice, it doesn't work.
Okay, look, Ross, I realise that my Father is difficult, but that's why you have got to be the bigger man here.
No. No, no, I'm not ready! How can I be ready? "Hey, Rach! You ready to jump out the airplane without your parachute?" Come on, I can't do this!
The word you're looking for is 'Anyway'...
All right, you ready?
You can, I know you can!
I don't think so.
Chandler! Chandler, please, I have to get you locked up back the way you were, I am sooo gonna lose my job, she's very private about her office. Now I know why.
All right, I'll go down there. But, I'm not gonna serve the lasagna. I'm gonna serve something I make.
Wow! My breasts are really strong.
Hey, look, you're in trouble either way! Okay? If she comes back and sees me locked to this instead of the chair, she's gonna know you were in here. So you might as well just let me go.
What if I clean your bathroom for a month?
It's not dumb. But, maybe it's okay that you're not a part of it. Y'know what I mean? I mean it's like, I-I-I like that you're not involved in that part of my life.
Y'know if what I do is so lame, then why did you insist on coming with me this morning? Huh? Was it so I just wouldn't go with Mark?
No. I... I wanted to be with you. I don't know, I feel like lately, I feel like you're slipping away from me, y'know. With this new job, and all these new people, and you've got this whole other life going on. I-I-I know it's dumb, but I hate that I'm not a part of it.
That's a little clearer.
Honey see, it doesn't mean that I don't love you. Because I do. I love you, I love you so much. But my work it's-it's for me y'know, I'm out there, on my own, and I'm doing it and it's scary but I love it, because it's mine. I, but, I mean is that okay?
Well, you've been here for two months now and your boss is required to hand in a performance evaluation. But y'know, there is one thing that I have yet to evaluate.
Okay, you hard worker! I'll remember to put that in your evaluation.
My what?
Are you serious?
No, I've just always wanted to do that. Can you help me clean this up?
I know. I always thought if you and I got married, it would be the one that stuck. And it wouldn't be a secret, and we wouldn't have our wedding dinner at Pizza Hut.
Yeah, don't push it though.
I've got to say; I know I divorce a lot of women, never thought I would be divorcing you.
Did I, did I even treat?
No, it was on the house, it was, it was a newlywed special.
Ross!! Are you crazy?! I am still your wife!! What, were you just never gonna tell me?!! What the hell is wrong with you?!!!! Ugh, I could just kill you!!!!
What's happening to your accent?
Come again? What's-what's this nonsense? All right, I'm-I'm not English. I'm from Long Island. I was really nervous and the accent just uh, just came out. I'm sorry. So, if we could just get back to the lecture. Umm, were there any questions? About paleontology. All right, look I was just trying to make a good first impression. Obviously, I screwed up. But what you guys think of me is really important because I'm-I'm hoping to get a permanent job here. So if you just give me another chance to make a good impression...
Well, hello Rachel!
Have you really done this before?
Hi! I love you on that show! I watch you everyday! I mean, when you took out your own kidney to save your ex-wife even though she tired to kill you...
Hi!
Hi!
Well, it's always nice to meet the fans.
Ah!
You went shopping?! What, and then you just came in here and paraded it right under Jill's nose when you know she's trying to quit. Wow, you guys are terrible!
No! They did!
Yeah, we went shopping!
Sorry Jill.
Sorry-sorry Jill.
Yeah, well that's that lo-cal, non dairy, soy milk junk. We sort of, we save the real stuff for those really terminal cases.
Welcome to our side of the tunnel.
This ice cream tastes like crap by the way.
You know, when you start get screwed over all the time, you gotta switch to low-fat.
Yeah, you do.
No, it's all right, you can just drop the act Tommy. I know what's going on here. Your Danny's wingman right? You guys are best buds. Frat bros!
Yeah, okay, at ease solider!
I'm sorry?
I'm gonna go talk to uh, a friend.
Yeah, yeah, you go talk to your friend. You tell him, "Nice try."
Terry, I, I, I know that I haven't worked here very long, but I was wondering, do you think it would be possible if I got a $100 advance in my salary?
Yup, and waaay out of your league.
Out of my league. I could get a Brian. If I wanted to get a Brian, I could get a Brian. Hey, Brian.
An advance?
It's so that I can spend Thanksgiving with my family. See, every year we go skiing in Vail, and normally my father pays for my ticket, but I sort of started the whole independence thing, you know, which is actually why I took this job.
Honey, that's very sweet, it just seems to me though, that if two people love each other and trust each other, like we do, there's no reason to be jealous.
Well, I was with Carol for like eight years and I lost her. And now if it's possible I think I love you even more. So, it's hard for me to believe that I'm not gonna, well that someone else is not going to take you away.
Let it be me! Let it be me!
I gotta get going. Bye Chandler.
Oh, okay Ross. Listen, this pen is kinda getting boring, so can you pick me up some porn?
Yeah, I'm pretty confident about that. That's what makes it so easy for me to be 80% happy for Monica and Chandler! It would be nice to have a little guarantee though.
We're gonna find love!
Definitely!
What do you mean?
Well y'know, some people make deals with a friend, like if neither of them are married by the time they're 40, they marry each other.
Okay, you just go on and make your little jokey-jokes, but if you do not know what you are doing out at sea you will die at sea. Am I getting through to you sailor?!
Time's up, now your dead.
And deaf!
Yes.
Don't just say yes! This isn't a game, Joey you can really get hurt out here. Okay, so do you want to pay attention or do you want to die?!
No well, no it's not that bad, y'know? I mean yeah, my tongue feels a little fuzzy and these fingers sort of smell, I actually feel like I can throw up.
I wish I had smoked for my career...
That's so gross!
Okay, but you gotta push past this because it is about to get so good!
Chandler! I have to tell you, you smell so smokey I have to get up. I'm not kidding.
Well of course I do! But y'know, favorite returning character is a tough category Joey. I mean you're up against the guy who survived his own cremation.
So you'll definitely get onstage, even if you don't win.
What you-you don't think I'm gonna win?
Yeah. No-no I-I know I might not win, but it's just...I've never even been nominated before! I want it so much.
Well Joey, you'll probably get it. But you should probably your-your gracious loser face. Y'know when like the cameras are on you and you wanna look disappointed but also that your colleague deserved to win. Y'know? So it's sorta like...
Guess what?! All that stuff about Nancy Branson being a slut was all a rumor so Chip dumped her and he wants to come over to my house tonight!
Oh yeah, it was great. You should be a chef.
Okay!
Oh that's so great!
I know!
Okay Joey honey, you're doing really good! All right, now I'm just gonna need you to step to the port side. Remember? Remember how we talked about the port side?
Are there anymore from the good batch? 'Cause we could just work off of those.
Yeah, ooh yeah, I think there is one from batch 17 left, uh... It's batch 16! 16 people! Get out of the way!
Ohh yeah.
Right?
Uh well, uh this is a silent auction. They lay out all the stuff here and then you write down your offer and then the highest bid gets it.
Oh! Thank you!
So now what's going on here?
No, I know what a silent is I meant, what's going on with your hair?
Uh, wh-why?
Nothing, I mean, um, it is your first time with her and, you know if the first time doesn't go well, well then that's, that's pretty darn hard to recover from.
OK, gook luck.
Wha, uhh, what?
OK, now I'm nervous.
Maybe you should put it off.
I am? Oh, look at that, yes I am. Enough about me, enough about me, Mr. Back from the Orient. Come on. I wanna hear everything! Everything.
What?
You're bleeding.
Well, where do I start? This is Julie. Julie, this is Rachel.
These are, these aren't for you. These are for you. Welcome to our country.
Anyway, speaking of drinking too much. I was uh, tellin' Phoebe about that one crazy night after the Sigma Chi luau where you and I uh, we made out.
Yeah! Y'know, we were really huge too, but then they had to shut us down when Regina Philange died of alcohol poisoning.
Oh, isn't a shame when one girl ruins it for the whole bunch?
What?
Remember?! We-come on both had the sarongs on, and we had the-the coconut bikini tops...
Okay. Now this is just the first chapter, and I want your absolute honest opinion. Oh, oh, and on page two, he's not 'reaching for her heaving beasts'.
Pretty good! I told her.
Well, see? So, maybe it wasn't such a bad idea, y'know, me kissing your mom, uh? Huh? But.. we don't have to go down that road.
What's a 'niffle'?
You usually find them on the 'heaving beasts'.
What do you mean, you fold? Hey, come on! What is this? I thought that 'once the cards were dealt, I'm not a nice guy.' I mean, what, were you just full of it?
: Loser?
No, I fold.
I'm in.
How many you want?
So now, these are all the tuxedos that we make and if there's anything that you like, we can make you a deal. Anything at all. But these are the three that Monica pre-approved.
Maybe you'll order a little sangria?
Oh, get out of here!
Well, thanks a lot for hookin' me up Rach. I want you to know that I want you to attend our wedding as my guest.
I'm Monica's maid of honor. Okay? Don't try to blue pin me!
He left work in the middle of the day to do a personal errand and left you in charge when you've been working here two days? That's not, that's not right.
How-how did you lose your job here?
Well, I had the audition but Gunther said I had to stay here and be in charge so he could go get his hair dyed. So, I went anyway, and then he fired me.
Yeah, what are ya gonna do?
Joey, you can't let him get away with that. Ya know what, I'm not going to let him get away with that. I'm going to say something to him-No, I really shouldn't say anything-No, I should say something to him. Gunther, I want you to give Joey his job back. That is really not fair that you have to fire him...
Well, well um, you know, these movies are offensive and uh, degrading to women and females. And uh, and the lighting's always unflattering. And, Monica help me out here.
Great, people having sex, that's just what I need to see.
What's wrong with people having sex?
Hell, I wanna see Joey.
So is there like a story or do they just stard doing it right. . . oh, never mind.
No we weren't! It was nothing! It was one night, senior year we went to a party, had a lot of sangria and y'know, ended up...kissing for a bit.
What?!
What?!
So that's two of my wives.
Okay so this is where the band is. And this is where the bar is. And all these pins have people's names on them. And Rach, here you are.
I know, I know, but uh just, I'm telling you, once, once you get past that part, that where it-it just feels like you wanna die, he's-he's really a good person.
Yeah.
Wow!
The guy with the gas?!
Yeah. I'm-I'm telling you he's really sweet and he's really funny and he's just ugh, got a good heart. And besides, I y'know, I think he really likes you.
Y'know what Ross? You're not going anywhere. You're gonna sit right here. I'm gonna make you a cup of tea and we're gonna talk this thing whole out. All right? Hey, Dave!
But, it's not raining.
I can't catch a break!
Yeah?
Umm, listen, I'm gonna need to take a rain check, my roommate is just really sick. Okay? Bye! Honey, listen, I know, I know things seem so bad right now.
Okay, hold on real quick, hold on a second let me just uh, get a little more comfortable here. Wait, now wait a second, this isn't too revealing is it?
Oh yeah surfer?
I wanted to be one with the waves, y'know?
No. What ever happened to that little dude. So full of dreams...
I don't care about the little dude! I can't! I cannot listen to anymore of this! Y'know, the only person who would want to listen to this is a mental health professional! And then it's only because they get paid $100 an hour! Do you know how much money I could've made listening to you? $2,000! And do you know when I figured that out? While you were talking!
Yeah. Thought I'd give it a shot. I'm still on the first chapter. Now, do you think his 'love stick can be liberated from its denim prison'?
Hey.
'A Woman Undone, by Rachel Karen Green'.
Yeah, I'd say so. And there's no 'j' in 'engorged'.
Hey Rach.
I don't know. I don't know... I thought about it all the way there, and I thought about it all the way back... and, uh, oh, you guys, y'know, it's Ross. Y'know what I mean? I mean, it's Ross.
I don't know, I-I guess I just had you pegged as one of those guys who're always 'me, me, me.' But you... you're a giver. You're like the most generous man I ever met. I mean... you're practically a woman.
Uh, so, uh, Rach, uh... do you wanna save this wrapping paper, I mean, it's only a little bit torn... so are you gonna go for it with Ross or should I just throw it out?
Sure.
I don't know, I mean, this is just my initial gut feeling... but I'm thinking... oh, I'm thinking it'd be really great.
Yeah but, you don't, you don't, you don't want to try to much too fast. Y'know? I mean, you do remember what happened to the little girl that tried to much too fast don't you?
Yeah but, he's not your type.
Yeah but maybe that's a good thing. Y'know I'm doing all these different sorts of things, and maybe I should try dating a geek too!
What?
She-she died Jill.
Ok, we can do this now, can't we Ben? Yes we can, yes we can. There. I did it. I did it. Look at that, oh, stays on and everything. Hi.
It's us.
Come on up. I'm gonna get the rest of his stuff together.
Hi.
I'm sorry, what did you just say? Did you just say hi? Oh my God, Ross, Ross, Ben just said 'Hi'.
No...oh, I feel so stupid! Oh, I think about the other day with you guys and I was all "Oh, Paolo, he's so great, he makes me feel so..." Oh, God, I'm so embarrassed!
I need some milk.
Ok, I've got milk Here you go... Oh! Better?
I'm so embarrassed, I'm the one he hit on!
Pheebs, if I had never met him this never would have happened!
Look he doesn't have any brothers or sisters, somebody's gonna have to teach him this stuff! And I haven't taught him anything that a normal 6-year-old doesn't know anyway!
Fine. Fine, but I'll have you know that once I taught him that stuff he called me Fun Aunt Rachel. And I loved being Fun Aunt Rachel but I'll go back to being Boring and Uncomfortable Aunt Rachel if that's what you want!
No that's not what I want. Uh, I'm glad you guys were bonding but I...
Crap!!
I gotta go!
All right, look. Why don't you just return the book, let Joey give her the clock pen, and you give her something worse than that. Like... a regular pen.
Any luck?
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I found this great place called "Invisible things for Kathy." Can you give me a hand with all this stuff?
She's really going to love this, you know? The bottom line is I want her to have it, even if I don't get to be the one who gives it to her.
Aw, honey, that's so sweet.
No, it's not gonna be okay Ross, tomorrow is my last day, and I don't have a lead. Okay, y'know what, I'm just gonna, I'm just gonna call Gunther and I'm gonna tell him, I'm not quitting.
I don't know, I don't know, weren't you the guy that told me to quit my job when I had absolutely nothing else to do. Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!!
Sweetie, calm down, it's gonna be okay.
You-you-you don't wanna give into the fear.
You and your stupid fear. I hate your fear. I would like to take you and your fear....
I don't know, you tell me. One minute I'm holding Ben like a football, the next thing I know, I've got two kids, I'm living in Scarsdale complaining about the taxes.
Ya know what, I think I'm gonna go to my room and read Cosmo, maybe there's something helpful in there. Know what, at least maybe I can learn how to do an at home bikini wax with leftover Cristmas candles.
Ok, what the hell happened back there?
Well I'm sorry, I think about stuff. Ya know, I mean, you're at work, you're assembling bones, your mind wanders.
Ross, you have planned out the next 20 years of our lives, we've been dating for six weeks.
Look, y'know I know my life's going pretty well, but I look around and I just see so many people who've accomplished so many other goals by the time they're thirty.
Rach, you're in a great place in your life. Come on, you've got a great job! Good friends...
Yeah, you're roommate is a soap opera star.
Yeah, but you shouldn't compare yourself to me.
Come on Phoebe! You can do it Phoebe! Come on!
Chandler, don't worry! This doesn't make you any less of a guy! That does! What am I sitting on? I hate to think what this woman was scratching when this broke off.
Chandler, there's a guy right over there.
That's a mailman! That's our mailman! Hi. How are ya?
Hey, you know who used to have nails like that?
Hmm.
No, there is no Rachel Greep, but then this other girl overheard us and she was all, "I'm Rachel Greep! I'm Rachel Greep!" and he let her right in.
The whole night was horrible, it was pouring down rain, and when I got there, there was no Rachel Green on the list, but there was a Rachel Greep.
Ohh! So, did you get to meet her?
So you hit her in the face?
No, she was already in, but then this big bitch behind me tried to steal my umbrella, so I clocked her. Ohhh! I can't believe this, all I wanted was a few hours outside of work to see Joshua, so he can go ahead and start falling in love with me.
All right, we were shaking hands and he kinda leaned toward me... Y'know maybe he was going to open the door, but I totally miss read him and I uhhh...
Ugh, it was horrible! And-and the interview part went so well, y'know? I even made him laugh. He said something about a boat and I was like, "Well, yeah! If you've got enough life jackets!" Trust me, it was actually, it was very funny. Anyway, so we were saying good-bye and ugh!
What happened?
You kissed him?!
Well, I didn't know what else to do!
Oh yes, absolutely! Y'know, it's weird uh, but I had a dream last night where I was stopped by a policeman. And then he uh...well I probably shouldn't tell you the rest.
Oh my God.
Can I see your license please?
Your license?
Yes. Here you go Officer uh, Handsome.
...And so then I realised. All this stuff I had been doing. proposing to Joshua, lying to Ross about why I couldn't come to the wedding. Was all just a way of...
Right!
So tell me about this girl?
Oh, oh oh!! I'm sorry, can I interrupt? You know I just want to say..That you are a horrible, horrible person.
Ehh, pardon me?
Yeah-yeah, y'know if-if there was just like one little area where I-that I think we need-we would need to work on; I-I would think it was we're just not crazy enough!
'Cause I am really happy about us. I think we are, I think we are so on the right track! Y'know? I mean, I think we are working, I think we are clicking. Y'know?
Yeah, sure-sure, yeah, we're-we're-we're-we're-we're clicking.
I-I gotta say, I-I-I-I'm not too sure I agree with that.
Well, yeah, right, y'know what? Yeah, you're right, I mean, we no, we have our fun. Yeah! But if ......I mean, I mean like craaaazy! Y'know? Okay, all right. This is gonna, this is gonna sound y'know, a little umm, hasty, but uh, just go with it. Umm. Ugh. What if we got married?
What?! She just called and said that she was gonna be working late! She keeps lying to me! That's it! Y'know what? I'm just gonna go over there and confront them right now!
Sure! Why?
Oh well, Chandler and Monica are over there and it's kinda hard to concentrate.
All right, so you're telling me that I have to tell racist jokes now?!
Sorry! I'm just-I'm not very good at this! I'm a terrible liar and I hate having to lie to Rachel!
Uh, yeah, well, see, he... Joey knows, that I'm-I'm very insecure about my back and, and...you're hugging me, so obviously you are not repulsed by it, yeah!
Street noise drowned any of that out? No, all right, I see you later, okay...
What did Joey say? I like you back?
Wait-wait a minute; that doesn't make any sense.
No? All right, here's the truth um, Joey said what he said, because um, I'm attracted to you.
Okay. Uhh, Ross, y'know what, there's something that I-that I have to talk to you about and everybody's saying that I shouldn't tell you, but I think they're wrong. I mean, and you know how people can be wrong.
Yeah, what's it about?
Events from around the globe.
Sure. Once, at work I-I thought carbon dating was fossilized...
Okay, Ross, I'm really trying to tell you something here.
Well, you have been in our lives for nearly two months now and we don't really know you. I mean, who is Julie? I mean, what do you like, what don't you like? We wanna hear everything.
Maybe that's all we do, what about Julie?
What about Julie?
Well, that could take a while.
So. I mean, who here does not have the time to get to know Julie?
Okay umm, Ross? I'm-I'm really warm, so I'm going to be taking off my sweater. Now, I'm just letting you know that this is not an invitation to the physical act of love.
What are you talking...
Hey-hey don't look at me! I just work here!
Yep! That's hilarious!
I'm sorry. I'm done. I'm done.
Now wait a minute that's not fair. He was married to me a hell of a lot longer than he was married to Emily, he just didn't tell me. Maybe I have to pee again.
I mean if you think about it, I mean Ross did learn something from each marriage.
How to make the next one even shorter?
Well, this is fun. So Ross, did you kill any of these wives?
Y'know what? I-I-I... I-I have had enough of this! Y'know, I-I-I care a great deal about your daughter and I have treated her with nothing but respect! So if-if you've got a problem with me, frankly...
What handsome is not your type? Smart? Kind? Good kisser? What those things aren't on your list? Ross is a great guy! You would be lucky to be with him!
No! No I, no Ross is not a geek!
Fine, then let's just say he's not my type.
Well okay, if it means that much to you, then I'll ask him out.
Oh no-no-no, no-no-no, that's not what I meant.
That is so sad. Your missing out on so much, Ross. I mean, the bonding and the sharing, you know. And-and knowing that someone else is going through the same thing you are.
Not even with your best friend.
Noo!
Hmph. So what you, you tell each other everything?
Pretty much.
Whoa!! Whoa, whoa, wait a minute. What time did your little friend leave? Oh my God. She was there? She was still there? She was in there, when I was in there?!
Yeah, never cheat on Rachel.
I'm sorry, okay, I'm sorry. I wa-I was disgusted with myself, and this morning I was so, I was so upset and then I got your message and I was so happy, and all I wanted was to get her out of my apartment as fast as possible.
Listen. Oh hey, hey, the important thing was that she meant, she meant nothing to me!
And yet she was worth jeopardising our relationship!!
Are any of you guys free tonight? My boss is hosting this charity event for underprivileged kids and the more people I bring, the better I look. So, Monica? Chandler?
Hey!
Hey Rach!
Well, Monica and Chandler can't go. We're going to dinner remember?!
Oh my God, I'm so sorry.
Oh, no, Michael, it's not you. I'm sorry, it's just, it's this thing. It's probably not as bad as it sounds but this friend of mine is, is getting a cat with his girlfriend.
Oh, right, clink.
Monica told you I was cuter that this, didn't she?
Oh, that does sound. . .Ahh.
I mean he just started going out with her.
Well Phoebe, we gotta do something! Well, y'know. I mean there's no way Joey's gonna make it in time. So I'm gonna through the hotel and see if there's any other weddings going on.
Oh fresh air!
Wait! Maybe, maybe you're overreacting! You do that y'know.
Okay. Oh but don't tell them Monica's pregnant because, they frown on that.
Okay.
Ohh please don't be from a real dinosaur! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Made in Mexico! Yes!! Ugh, who would buy this?!
Yeah.
Yeah, what's that like?
Rach! It's me! Pick up!
Hey! What's up?!
As I was saying... I should probably have the first of the three kids by the time I'm 35 which gives me five years. I love this plan! I wanna marry this plan!
Okay! Y'know what? I realized it was stupid to get upset about not having a husband and kids. All I really needed was a plan. See I wanna have three kids...
Oh let me guess, and you wanna have them all at the same time and you wanna have them for your brother.
If you could do that, I'd marry the hippity-hop.
So, if I wanna have my kid when I'm 35, I don't have to get pregnant until I'm 34. Which gives Prada four years to start making maternity clothes! Oh wait, but I do want to be married for a year before I get pregnant...
Well yeah, I do, but I decided to take a long lunch and spend some time with my friend Monica. Y'know I-I feel that we don't talk anymore. How are you? What is new with you?
What's up?!
What are you doing here? I thought you had to do inventory all day.
Uhh, not much. Uh, work's good.
Oh y'know what, we don't have to talk about work. We can talk about anything!
I'll be right there! Okay, Ross, please come on! I thought we have moved on! I thought we've gotten to a place where we could be happy for each other! I mean was that just me?
Ohh, she's looking down the hall. Oh! She looked right at me! Oh wait, you can't see people through that little hole, can you? Hello!
Hello!
All right, I'll do it.
Oh thank you! Thank you, thank you, thank you! Emily?
No. Joey, she knows! We were at Ugly Naked Guy's apartment and we saw them doing it through the window. Actually, we saw them doing it up against the window.
Phoebe just found out about Monica and Chandler.
You mean how they're friends and nothing more?
Okay, so now they know that you know and they don't know that Rachel knows?
Yes, but y'know what? It doesn't matter who knows what. Now, enough of us know that we can just tell them that we know! Then all the lying and the secrets would finally be over!
Mrs. Bing, I have to tell you, I've read everything you've ever written. No, I mean it! I mean, when I read Euphoria at Midnight, all I wanted to do was become a writer.
...But a man can change.
Anyone want me to appraise anything?
Oh, please, honey, listen, if I can do it, anybody can. You just start with half a dozen European cities, throw in thirty euphemisms for male genitalia, and bam! You have got yourself a book.
Myyy mother, ladies and gentlemen.
Ok, I, I hear what you're sayin'. I'm with you. Um, but I, but I'm trying really hard. And I think I'm doing better. I really do. Does anybody need coffee? Oh, look at that.
It's so that I can spend Thanksgiving with my family. See, every year we go skiing in Vail, and normally my father pays for my ticket, but I sort of started the whole independence thing, you know, which is actually why I took this job.
Rachel, Rachel, sweetheart. You're a terrible, terrible waitress. Really, really awful.
Excuse me, sir. Hi, you come in here all time. I was just wondering, do you think there's a possibility that you could give me an advance on my tips?
Huh?
Look! I cleaned! I did the windows, I did the floors... I even used all the attachments on the vacuum, except that little round one with the bristles, I don't know what that's for.
Tah-daaah!
Are we greeting each other this way now? 'Cause I like that.
Oh yeah, nobody knows. And we're not supposed to ask.
Well, whaddya think?
Hi, it's me. I've been trying to reach you all night. I feel awful. Please, Ross, you gotta know there is nothing between me and Mark. This whole break-up thing is just stupid.
No, no-no, it's okay, calm down. Mark and I talked, and I realised how much I love your stupid brother, and, yeah, we got our problems, but I really want to make it work.
Morning!
Yeah!!
Eh, I'm just so sorry I put you through it. And, I y'know, I don't want to get back together over a machine.
Why hasn't he called Rachel? Why? Why? I don't understand. Why? He said he'll call. Why? Why? Chandler I'm telling you she has flipped out, she's gone crazy!
Call her! Call her now!
Multiple, so many paper cuts.
Oh, well give me the phone then.
Come on, this isn't funny. She thinks it's my fault that you haven't called her. You have to call her!
Oh, I mean she's gonna be at the wedding waiting for him and people will be whispering, "Oh that poor girl." Y'know? Then she'll have to come back here and live all alone.
Oh God I just can not imagine what is gonna happen if Chandler doesn't show up!
Oh here's a whole bunch.
Oh my God!
What?
Oh, she wants to see me tomorrow...Oh, she sounded really weird, I gotta call Barry... Hi, it's me, I just.. Mindy!! Mindy! Hi! No, I figured that's where you'd be!
Hello? Mindy! Hi! Hey, how are you? Yes, yes, I've heard, congratulations, that is so great. Really? Oh. Okay. Okay, well I'm working tomorrow, but if you want you can, you can, you can come by and... Okay... Great... Great... All right, so I'll, so I'll see you tomorrow! Okay.. Okay... Bye. Oh God. Oh God. Oh God.
So how's Mindy?
Brrrrrrr!
Hell is filled with people like you.
So. I just thought the two of us should hang out for a bit. I mean, you know, we've never really talked. I guess you'd know that, being one of the two of us, though, right?
Sure.
So.
I know, I probably shouldn't even tell you this, but I'm pretty much totally intimidated by you.
Really? Me?
Go to the post office! I'm sure her picture's up! ...Okay, Monica, y'know what, honey, you're kinda losing it here! I mean, this is really becoming like a weird obsession thing.
What, what, so that you can dance with the woman that stole your credit card?
This woman's got my life, I should get to see who she is.
This is madness. It's madness, I tell you, for the love of God, Monica, don't do it!! ...Thank you.
What d'you think?
Oh well, hello. This is your lucky day Mr. Bowmont, the uh gentleman day sailer as just become available again and I believe that you made a bid of $18,000.
That's me.
Ahh, yes.
You-you have to pay that! It's not just a guess.
Okay. Okay.
Ok, ok, ok, moving on, moving on, next question. Ok number 29, have you ever betrayed another goddess for a lightning bearer? Ok, number 30.
Paul.
Oh.
Woah, woah, woah, let's go back to 29.
Not uh, not to my recollection.
Well, apparently she caught him cheating on her with someone else. Isn't that sad? God, could you imagine if I actually married him?! I mean how different would my life be?
Yeah, but that just means that he was falling asleep on top of her instead of me.
Why did they get divorced?
I know what you mean, I've always wondered how different my life would be if-if I'd never gotten divorced.
Which time?
I've never interviewed anyone before. I've actually never had anyone work for me before. Although when I was a kid, we did have a maid, but this is-this isn't the same thing.
Okay, well this is all very impressive Hilda, um I just have one last question for you. Uh, how did I do? Was this okay?
What?
No dear. It's not.
No. Yeah, and I know that. All right, well thank you so much for coming in it was nice to meet you.
It's just some things I've been thinking about. Some things about us, and before we can even think about the two of us getting back together, I just need to know how you feel about this stuff.
I wrote you a letter.
Ohh! Thank you! I like mail.
Okay. Wow, it's-it's 5:30 in the morning. So, I'd better get cracking on this baby.
Well, I'll be waiting for you, just come up when you're done.
No, no-no, it's okay, calm down. Mark and I talked, and I realised how much I love your stupid brother, and, yeah, we got our problems, but I really want to make it work.
No.
Rachel, you and Mark?!
Morning!
Hi, it's me. I've been trying to reach you all night. I feel awful. Please, Ross, you gotta know there is nothing between me and Mark. This whole break-up thing is just stupid.
Oh, I don't know. Well maybe it's just the idea of Barry for the rest of my life. I don't know I think I feel like I need to have one last fling, y'know, just to sorta get it out of my system.
Yeah, I know.
What?
Rachel stop!
You're so bad!
I know, isn't he great? It's so nice to finally be in a fun relationship, y'know? There's nothing boring about him, and ah, I bet he's never set foot in a museum.
Wow, cute one!
Very!
Well maybe he'll get to go soon, like on a class trip or something.
Y'know what else is really great about him, oh, what is the word for the adult that doesn't have dinosaur toys in their bedroom?
Y'know what? I am going to do something today. I'm not just gonna sit around like some old lady. I'm gonna get something pierced. Like my uh, like my nose or my tongue or something.
Damnit!
Okay, who's next?
Really?! 'Cause y'know that hurts.
So what?! Y'know what? The way I see it--Ow! Son of a bitch!!
Handling it? What do you mean, handling it? There's nothing to handle. Now, maybe I would have a problem with this if it wasn't for me and Joshua. Y'know, they're not gonna get married anyway!
Hey, I hear that you and Joshua are going out to dinner with Ross and Emily, and I think that's, I think that's really cool.
Yeah, Rach, I think you're handling that really well.
What?
Come on! They rushed into this thing so fast it's ridiculous! I mean, they're gonna be engaged for like what? A year? And somewhere along the way, one of them is gonna realise what they've done and they're call the whole thing off. I'm telling ya, you're gonna be dancing at my wedding before you're dancing at there's.
When I saw him get off that plane with her, I really thought I hit rock bottom. But today, it's like there's rock bottom, 50 feet of crap, then me.
What?
Look, I can sense when women are depressed and vulnerable. It's one of my gifts.
You gotta tell Ross how you feel.
Come on. How can I just tell him? What about Julie?
Yes!! I mean sex does not have to be a big deal! There shouldn't be all this rules and restrictions! Y'know, people should be able to sleep with who ever they want, whenever...
Oh my God!! Do it!! Honey, you've waited long enough!!
Y'know what? You are right?!
Rachel! I'm never gonna think it's okay for you to cheat on your husband!
Oh what do you know? Virgin!
Oh yeah, c'mon, I'm movin' on. He can press her up against that window as much as he wants. For all I care, he can throw her through the damn thing.
Oh what, my whole insane jealousy thing? Well, y'know, as much fun as that was, I've decided to opt for sanity.
So you really OK about all this?
Hi guys.
Hey.
Okay, first of all, if you keep calling it that, no one's gonna ever take it. Then, second of all you're not actually gonna have sex with him! You're just gonna make him think that you are.
Well guys tend to get naked before they're gonna have sex.
What?! I mean, I didn't work this hard and-and-and lose all this weight so that I can give my flower to someone like him!
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, it was senior year in college. It was after the Sigma Chi luau and Melissa and I got very drunk! And we ended up kissing! For several minutes!
Sure!
Hey. It happened!
Which means she had a couple spritzers and a quick peck on the cheek.
Why are you taking this away from me?
Okay. Thank you! Thank you! Because-I'm sorry, all right. Because y'know what? She didn't want me-not important. The point is, I was right. Your decision. Okay? I was right. Your decision.
Now, that-that was a good thing that I told you, right?
Huh? Yeah! Yes, of course!
Right. I guess, I guess I should call Emily.
Okay, no, that's not the right decision. That's not, that's not right, no Ross-Ross, come on! I mean, that woman made you miserable! Okay, Ross, do you really want to get back into that?
Ross, hi, it's Rachel. I'm just calling to say that um, everything's fine and I'm really happy for you and your cat......I am over you. I am over you and that, my friend, is what they call closure.
She didn't hang up either...
Ok, no, no, you hang up. You, you, y-
Rach, I got a message from you.
Oh my God. Oh my God Ross, no, hang up the phone, give me the phone Ross, give me the phone, give me the phone, give me the. . .
Huh-Wait so Joey if you get this, you're gonna be like the star of your own TV show! I mean you'll be like the Big Cheese! Or the Big Mac-Hey! You love those!
That's the title! Yeah! Y'know they really lucked out that the initials spell cheese.
That is lucky.
Well, don't get your hopes up, because probably not gonna happen.
Now-now, why would you say that Joseph?
You should find out what his hobbies are and then use that to bond with him. Yeah! Like if I would strike up a conversation about say umm, sandwiches. Or uh, or my underwear.
Y'know what you should do?
Huh?
I'm listening.
See?
And the chicken pooped in her lap. Oh, I'm so sorry. I just gave away the ending, didn't I? Oh! It's just, I just heard this story in the cab, and it is all I can think about.
200 at least.
...and this guy...
This is amazing. I mean, how, how did this happen?
Well, Ross and I were in grad school together.
No, listen to me. I fell for you and I get clobbered. You then fall for me and I again, somehow, get clobbered. I'm tired of being clobbered, ya know, it's, it's just not worth it.
Ross, there is no us, OK.
No, but. . .
Well, but, but. . .
NO but Ross. We are never gonna happen, OK. Accept that.
Noooo... look, all I know is that I cannot wait a week until I see him. I mean, this is just too big. Y'know, I just, I've just gotta talk to him. I... I gotta... OK, I'll see you later.
I don't know. Maybe I'll know when I see him.
Here, look, alright, does this help?
Rachel, I love you! Deal with me first!

I mean, we are way past the fling thing, I mean, I am feeling things that I've only read about in Danielle Steele books, you know? I mean, when I'm with him, I'm totally, totally...
Ah, it's just a weekend, big deal!
Wasn't this supposed to be just a fling, huh? Shouldn't it be... flung by now?
...nauseous, I'm physically nauseous. What am I supposed to do, huh? Call immigration? I could call immigration!
I love babies, with their little baby shoes, and their little baby toes, and their little baby hands...
All right! Let's get this over with! Ugh! Ohhh! No! Look what I did! Oh, I mean, look at this mess! I mean, we're probably gonna have to clean this up! Y'know? We're gonna have to reschedule!
Thank you.
Hey Rach, come on! We're gonna be late for the eye doctor appointment!
No. If you thought this mess is going to bother me, you are wrong! All right, let's go Blinky! Chandler!!!!
Oh hey Joey! What's up?
Oh please. That Paolo thing was barely a relationship. All it really was was just, ya know, meaningless animal sex. Ok, ya know, that sounded soooo much better in my head.
Oh honey, are you jealous of Paolo? Oh, c'mon, I'm so much happier with you than I ever was with him.
Really?
Eddie, I didn't sleep with your ex-girlfriend.
That's very interesting, ya know, 'cause that's exactly what someone who slept with her would say.
Well, first of all, Paulo and I are not back together. It was just a stupid thing I did, and if I could go back in time and do it again, well, I wouldn't. Um, second of all , what?
That's ok.
What's goin' on?
Ok. Well, before I say anything, I just need to know, is this one of those things where you break up with a guy, and then I tell you what I think, and then the next day you get back together with the guy, and I look like a complete idiot?
No. No-no-no-no.
Like a little girl. I know. I know. I know. This is all my fault; I wanted him to open up. But God, I didn't know that I was gonna unleash this-this weepy, clingy, moist monster!
Oh my God! Oh my God!!
Still crying?
Y'know, I only know of two surefire ways to shut a man up. And one of them is sex.
What's the other one?
Okay. Okay. I think we can do this if we just get organized. All right? We have two days to plan this party. We just need to make fast decisions! Okay? All right, where are we gonna have it?
Phoebe, I already, I already did.
Oh okay. All right, then I need to calm down a little.
Uh, here. What time?
4 o'clock. Food?
You guys are gonna love meee! Okay, check it out, Thursday night, five tickets, Calvin Klein lingerie show, and you guys are coming with me. Okay, I said that out loud right?
Oh. Here's your moisturiser. Hi!
Hey!
Yes, yes, it's just that we ah, we kinda all ready, made plans with Ross.
Oh, well okay. Well, there you go.
I know. Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. All right, this is what we're gonna do, we are gonna go to the next highest bidder, and we are just gonna let them buy it, and then you're just gonna pay the difference.
Hey! You...can't...leave Joey! You agreed to buy that boat, all right?! That is a contract! And plus if you leave, my boss is gonna kill me!
Well, what am I gonna do Rach?! I don't have that kind of money!
Okay.
Okay.
Hello, Mark? Hi, it's Rachel Green. Oh no, don't you apologize. Yeah, I'll hold. He left my number at work, but he was helping his niece with her report on the pioneers.
Yeah, and you don't mind if I call, because you only want good things for me.
That's right good things, that-that is what I said.
That is so made up!
Yeah, oh my God, tomorrow! That, no, it's perfect. Oh God, thank you soo much. Great! Bye! I got the interview!
I'm fine! I'm fine! I'm just losing a tooth, it's no big deal. I have a dentist! Y'know. I'm gonna go put some ice on it. Excuse me. What do I do now? What do I do now?
What do you get? Emily!! Emil-Whoa!! Okay! So that's me as a cheerleader! Ta-dum!
Are you all right?
I think you're done.
Okay, time to take off the bra.
I know. Oh-oh, wait did you hear that-hear that? Listen, I'm gettin' something from your grandmother, she said that since you get to keep the one bedroom apartment you should give Rachel the purple chair?
Oh please, I hate packing, it's closer to work, and we do have fun. Although, I'm really gonna miss living with you.
Oh me too.
No, I do not hear that.
...and the miracle was that that little bit of oil that should've just lasted just one day, burned for...
I, I don't know, um, do you think you're cute? OK, we're kinda gettin' off the track here. Um, I was supposed to come here and tell you my friend thinks you're cute. So what should I tell her?
Um, this is gonna sound kinda goofy but uhhm, my friend over there, who cooks by the way, um, she thinks you're cute.
You don't think I'm cute?
You can tell her I think her friend is cute.
No, Stephen Hurs was the kid who would eat anything for money, David Stein was the guy who had no elbows.
Ross, that girl just spent the entire evening talking to your friends, asking to hear stories about you, looking through Monica's photo albums, I mean you don't do that if you're just in it for two weeks.
You seem to really like her.
Yeah, I really do. Yeah, but what am I gonna do, I mean we-we both agreed that it was gonna be a two-week thing, y'know no commitment.
You think?
Yeah, you got like 14 hours until she has to be at the airport, and you're sitting here in the hallway with a 28-year-old cheerleader with a fat lip.
Oh honey, come on, I'm sorry, I didn't.... I don't mind paying my dues, y'know, its just how much am I gonna learn about fashion by walking Mira, the arthritic seamstress, to the bathroom.
Oh, I wanna quit, but then I think I should stick it out, then I think why would such a person stay in such a demeaning job, just because it's remotely related to the field they're interested in.
Gee, I don't know Rach. Order up!! I got a Yentel soup, a James Beans, and a Howdy hold the Dowdy!
Hi! Is my misery amusing to you?
I'm sorry, I wa, I wa, I was just ah....
At the Copa, Copa Cabana The hottest spot north of Havana. At the Copa, Coo-pa Ca-ban-a, music and fashion were always the passion, at the Copa....
"...marenge, thank you honey, and do the cha-cha. And while she like to be a star, Tony always tended bar. At the, wait, wait, everybody.."
Everybody!
Okay, I'll do it.
You'll do what?
Oh, look at me, look at me. Oh, I'm on a date with a really great guy, all I can think about is Ross and his cat and his... Julie. I just want to get over him. gosh, why can't I do that?
Oh, you're not having fun, are you?
No, no, I am, but only because for the last hour and a half I've been playing the movie Diner in my head.
Oy. Look, I've been through a divorce, trust me you're gonna be fine. You just can't see it now because you haven't had any closure.
Yeah! Closure. That's what it is, that's what I need. God, you're brilliant! Why didn't I think of that? How do I get that?
Okay, well you are just gonna have too, okay. Because I already got a Mother and a Father who cannot stay in the same room together, okay, I don't wanna have to have a separate room for you too!!
Okay, well can't you just try it one more time Ross? For me? For me?
Rachel one brunch is not gonna solve anything. You gotta face it, okay we're never gonna get along.
Okay, okay, okay. I'll get the bagels.
What's this?
Yes, I know that. I know that. And I know that hiring him was probably not the smartest thing that I've ever done. But I'm telling you, from this moment on I swear this is strictly professional. Yes?
All right I know, I know how it looks Pheebs, but I'm telling you...
But-but you know you cannot get involved with your assistant.
Hey Rachel!
Hi!
Ross do you realise this is the first time in my life I'm doing something I actually care about. This is the first time in my life I'm doing something that I'm actually good at. I mean. if you don't get that...
Just a job!
Yes.
No, hey, I get that, okay, I get that big time. And I'm happy for ya, but I'm tired of having a relationship with your answering machine! Okay, I don't know what to do anymore.
Well neither do I!
Oh well, the woman I interviewed with was pretty tough, but y'know thank God Mark coached me, because once I started talking about the fall line, she got all happy and wouldn't shut up.
Hi.
How'd did it go?
I'm so proud of you.
Me too!
Oh, honey, please, no, I can't get started with all that Ross stuff again. I mean, he's gonna screwed up for a looong time. And besides y'know, I don't, I don't go for guys right after they get divorced.
How's Ross doing? Y'know since all the Emily stuff.
He's not great umm, but he's dealing with it. Oh wait a minute, you're not gonna try...
Right, you only go for them 5 minutes before they get married.
Two pounds of Moca Java please.
Oh, um, no, no, no, no excuse me, hello. Hi. My friend ordered an onion, not an olive, and uh I ordered a rum and Diet Coke, which I don't think this is.
Oh look, the pool table's free. Rack 'em up. I'll be back in just a minute. Get ready for me to whip your butt.
Okay, but after that, we're shootin' some pool.
I am so sorry.
That's all right. I mean hard is it to get a couple drinks right, huh?
Pheebs, I can't believe he hasn't kissed you yet. I mean God, by my sixth date with Paolo, I mean he had already named both my breasts! ...Ooh. Did I just share too much?
Hey, that guy's going home with more than a note!
Come here, Marcel. Sit here.
Just a smidge.
David's like, y'know, Scientist Guy. He's very methodical.
Barbara! Hi, how are you? Uh-huh. No, I understand. Yeah. Oh, oh, come on, no, I'm fine. Don't be silly. Yeah... oh, but you know, if-if anything else opens up, pleaHello? Hello?
Mee mee, mee-mee mee.
Excuse me. It's about the job.
Sorry, Rach.
Y'know, there's gonna be lots of other stuff.
Yeah. Yeah, I-I-I see the scare. Listen, Paul, I think this is really great that-that y'know, you shared your feelings. It's really, it's beautiful, but umm, what do you say we go share some food?
Oh!
And in fifth grade I got into a fight. Well, it wasn't really a fight. Richard Darinvel bit me on the nose and, and I feel down. I still have a little scare right here you can see it.
Oh, I couldn't eat now.
What?! Wait! What are you talking about?! You love their Kung Pao Chicken!
No, I-I just don't know how you decide who to hire. I mean I've got it narrowed down to two people. One of them has great references and a lot of experience and then there's this guy...
Chandler, you have an assistant right?
Did she call? You-you told her I was sick right? Always tell her I am sick!
What about him?
I love him. He's so pretty I wanna cry! I don't know what to do. Tell me what to do.
Ugh! Look you guys, I'm really excited about this! Okay? I don't care what you think! I'm gonna go set up a little litter box for Mrs. Whiskerson. Well, what am I gonna call her? Fluffy?!
Free cats do that too, y'know. {Which reminds me, if I might get a little political here, support your local animal shelter. Pet shops are not the place to buy dogs and cats from, you get a much better deal from the shelter, plus they probably won't die on you in a week and a half. If you want a leash, go to the pet shop. If you want the dog for that leash, go to the shelter and save it's life. Now back to regularly scheduled programming.}
It's not a cat!
Hey, you wanna get something to eat or uh, do you wanna see how long we can throw this ball back and forth? Huh?
Uhh, the ball thing.
Oh, I'm sorry. You know what? I cannot have this conversation with you. I mean, god, you just come in here, and drop this bomb on me, before you even tell Daddy. What? What do you want? Do you want my blessing?
I'm dicing, I'm dicing, I don't hear anything.
I mean, this is no offense to your dad, sweetie, but I was thinking there might be more.
No.
You want me to talk you out of it?
Oh, I know, I know, it's-it's so, it's so totally like, "Whoa! Can we do this?" Y'know, I mean, but I mean it just feels right! Don't you think? It does! I mean, it just feels right, don't you think?
Well, yeah, right, y'know what? Yeah, you're right, I mean, we no, we have our fun. Yeah! But if ......I mean, I mean like craaaazy! Y'know? Okay, all right. This is gonna, this is gonna sound y'know, a little umm, hasty, but uh, just go with it. Umm. Ugh. What if we got married?
What?!
Wow! Uhh, Rachel uhh, you're a real special lady, but my divorce isn't final yet and, and, and we've been on four days, so I'm thinking "No, but thanks."
YOU IDIOT!!!!!
Did you get all this stuff for Joey to try and drive me out of the apartment? Honey, if you wanted to do that, you might as well just gotten him a fish, you know how fish freaked me out!
Phoebe?
Hm?
Fish!
It wouldn't have mattered anyway, Phoebe, you and I are, are gonna live together, we're roommates; that's the deal.
Ross said my name. Okay? My name. Ross said my name up there that obviously means that he still loves me! Okay, don't believe me, I know I'm right-do you guys want to go downstairs and get a drink?
Oh my God, Rachel! Hi!
Oh, hello Rachel.
Yes, we do. But, we have to change first.
Yes, I want to change. And why-why don't you go down and get us a table?
I don't know, you thought 'See you Saturday' was funny. Look honey, Mark is in fashion okay, I like having a friend that I can share this stuff with. You guys would never want to go to a lecture with me.
Okay, well if I stop playing with Joey and Chandler, can I play with Mark?
Is that funny? Am I supposed to be laughing?
Pa-haa!! I would love to go with you.
Really!?
Ahh, hi! Hi! Melissa, what's up? I'm just uh, about to umm, go out to the store to get some stuff to put in my backpack. Y'know, like dried fruit and granola and stuff. What's up?
Oh, great could you make me four copies of those?
Hey Rachel!
Umm, is Tag here?
No. Why?
Joey! Come on! I don't wanna make any mistakes, alright? This is the only dessert and if I screw it up everybody's gonna be like "Oh, remember that Thanksgiving when Rachel screwed up the trifle?"
No, I did, but tell me again, because it's so romantic.
Well you're whippin' so slow! Can't you do it any faster?
So why don't you just let me worry about making the trifle and you just worry about eating it, alright?
Oh I am!
Okay, wait a minute. Wait a minute, I-I-I, I can't do this. Listen honey, this is, it's not Phoebe's fault. She lent me the earrings, and I lost it. I'm so sorry. Honey, I feel terrible too.
Look at you! Come here! Feel better?
Yeah! You're the best!
That is exactly why I do not lend you stuff!! Okay?! I mean, first it's my jewelry! And if it's not my jewelry, it's-it's my blue sweater! And if it's not my sweater, it's my sunglasses!
Your sunglasses?!
Yes. Monica, you don't get it. It's bad enough that she's stolen the guy who might actually be the person that I am supposed to be with, but now, she's actually , but now she's actually stealing you.
Yes.
It's that terrible?
Me? What are you talking about? Nobody could steal me from you. I mean, just because I'm friends with her doesn't make me any less friends with you. I mean, you're my...We're, we're...Oh, I love you.
I love you too.
Noo! Oh no! No! God no! He should not get back together with her. I know that! You know that! Even Ross knows that! But that still doesn't give us the right to erase his message!
What?! We can't do that!
We have too! I mean what if Ross's hears that and then calls her back and then they get back together? Is that what you want? Ross back with that controlling, neurotic, crazy Emily? The Emily that wouldn't let him see you?
I'm his sister, okay? I love him! I don't want to see him get hurt! Come on! Doesn't that give me the right to control him-help him?
I don't think he's the one who needs help.
Okay. Okay honey, he's fine, he's fine, let's just put him down. Come here, Ben. See that's a good boy. How could you do that to him!! Ross trusted me, what is he going to say?!
Here. Ben, do you wanna play the airplane game, do you wanna show Rachel? Come here. We're gonna do something fun. Okay. Weee!! Weee!!
Who's so brave, you're so brave, yes you are, you're so brave.
He's not gonna say anything, because we're not gonna tell him.
We're not?!
Ohh, it's Joshua invited me to this fancy club opening tonight. But, I already told Mr. Waltham that I would take his niece to this dumb old opera. So... What are you gonna do?
Hey, Monica!
Uh-oh, what's the matter?
I don't know sweetie.
No! Help me!
I know. And Mom, I realize you and Daddy were upset when I didn't marry Barry and get the big house in the suburbs with all the security and everything, but this is just so much better for me, you know?
Yeah, well just be glad he's not playing a smaller instrument.
You have some life here, sweetie.
I do. You didn't love Barry. And I've never seen you this happy. I look at you and I think, oh, this is what I want.
For...me.
Well sure, if you say you're gonna take care of everything I have no reason to doubt you. Give me those forms! All right, now I'm gonna do this my way and I don't want to hear a peep out of you!
Oh look who it is, my husband. The apple of my eye.
Okay, I got us a court date for tomorrow at 2:00 and I picked up all the forms. I'll take care of everything.
Okay Rach, but...
Op! You're peeping!
Hey! We were not on a-Okay. That's fine! Fine. Y'know what Ben? One day when you are a lot older I am going to tell you that entire story over a pitcher of real margaritas, okay?
No, I'm not.
'Cause you guys were on a break.
When's my daddy coming back?
Fifty-two minutes. So no-no brothers and sisters, huh? That must be nice. You don't have to share stuff.
Yes, so close. Mrs. Lynch, I know that this is an emotional and difficult time, for all of us. But by any chance did Joanna send any paperwork your way before... it happened.
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh God.
I didn't realize that she was so close.
No. Nothing. Imagine, if she had just stepped off that curb a few seconds later.
Yes-yes, just a few seconds and she'd still be with us-nothing about an assistant buyer?
Okay, Monica, can you just call it sex?! It really creeps me out when you call it that! Okay, and by the way, while we're at it, a guy's thing is not called his tenderness. Believe me! Hi!
Well, you know that my parents are out of town and Chip was going to come over...
Yeah, yeah, and you were going him y'know, your flower.
Hi Rachel!
Happy Thanksgiving!
Oh, okay. Is that what you want to do? You wanna go over and give a little shout out to the old, hot chickas? Okay, let's do that Sailor Joe. Quick question though, what's this called?
Okay, I'm just gonna go over the basic points just one more time, are you ready?
Come on Rach, not again. I got it! Okay? Let's start sailing, and I want to go over there where that boatload of girls is! Yo-ho-ho!
Uh, boat rope.
Wrong! How do you get the mainsail up?
Oh, what a load of crap. That is a dot. Your mother is up in heaven going, 'Where the hell is my lily, you wuss?' OK, Phoebe, that is not a tattoo, this is a tattoo.
That is not a tattoo, that is a nothing. I finally got her back in the chair, bairly touched her with a needle, she jumped up screaming, and that was it.
OK, hi. For your information this is exactly what I wanted. This is a tattoo of the earth as seen from a great distance. It's the way my mother sees me from heaven.
You got a tattoo?
Maybe. But just a little one. Phoebe got the whole world.
Oh my ... you think I'm a pushover. Well wait, watch this, you know what? You're not invited to lunch. What do you think of that? I think that's pretty strong, that's what I think. Come on, Monica, let's go to lunch.
What? Wait a minute. What are you saying, that I'm a pushover? I'm not a pushover.
Oh, okay, you're not a pushover.
You start working on that list.
I cannot believe her.
I forgot... I am supposed to pick up a friend at the airport. I am so sorry! I'm so... if you want to stay, and finish your drinks, please do.... I meanI'm sorry. I-I-I gotta go. I'm sorry.
You know what?
What?
But...
Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me, excuse me, sorry. Hi.
Y'know, it was, uh.. it was actually really great. He took me to lunch at the Russian Tea Room, and I had that chicken, where y'know you poke it and all the butter squirts out...
Hey Rach!
How'd it go?
Not a good day for birds...
Then we took a walk down to Bendall's, and I told him not to, but he got me a little bottle of Chanel...
Well, maybe sometimes I find out things or I hear something and I pass that information on y'know kinda like a public service, it doesn't mean I'm a gossip. I mean, would you call Ted Kopel a gossip?
Hey Rach, maybe your resolution should be to umm, gossip less.
I don't gossip!
Well if Ted Kopel talked about his coworkers botched boob jobs, I would.
What? They were like this!
What are you talking about? I love them! Yeah, I had a tarantula when I was a kid. But it-it died, because my cat ate it. And then, then my cat died. But Joey, isn't this cool?
Oh wait, before you tell me what it is! Okay, what is it?
It's a...tarantula! Oh! God! Rachel, look, I'm sorry. What was I thinking giving Joey this big, gross, scary spider in such a poorly constructed cage?
Is it on me? I feel, I feel like it's on me! I got, hey!
Oh, isn't that adorable? Joey is afraid of the tarantula.
God! Don't-We can't let her start getting ready! This is too awful! Oh God, but wait she'll be in the gown and then he won't show up and then she's gonna have to take off the gown...
Y'know she might not even notice he's gone.
I'm gonna start getting ready!
Shhh! Stop it! Stop it Rachel! You can't do this here!
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's just...It's just so sad!
Hey, Chandler, don't freak out! I'm telling you something you already know! Come on, she broke up with Richard because he didn't want to have babies. And she's a woman, and she's almost 30, and y'know it's Monica.
Well, because she loves you and because you love her.
Yeah, so, what's that supposed to mean?!
I don't see it that way. Okay? Because, I see two Monicas, the one that was my friend, who lived across the hall, and wanted to have a lot of babies and then the new Monica, who I just started to date. Now, who's to say what she wants?! I'm right. I'm right. Am I right?
No, you're right, you are absolutely right. I mean that makes, that makes everything different.
Phoebe, we can't, we just can't just let it happen! Okay, we have to do something! We have to break them up! Okay? Just go in there and like, shave her head! You owe me one bald girl!!
You said she was bald!!
What?! What-what-what-what-what?!!
Okay, first of all, breathe. Second of all, I don't get it. Aren't you the one that decided that you didn't want to be with Ross?
Yes.
Oh, I wanna quit, but then I think I should stick it out, then I think why would such a person stay in such a demeaning job, just because it's remotely related to the field they're interested in.
Oh God, I hate my job, I hate it, I hate my job, I hate it.
I know honey, I'm sorry.
Gee, I don't know Rach. Order up!! I got a Yentel soup, a James Beans, and a Howdy hold the Dowdy!
Oh honey, come on, I'm sorry, I didn't.... I don't mind paying my dues, y'know, its just how much am I gonna learn about fashion by walking Mira, the arthritic seamstress, to the bathroom.
Look Monica, getting cold feet is very common. Y'know, it's-it's just because of all the anticipation and you just have to remember that you love Chandler. And also, I ran out on a wedding. You don't get to keep the gifts.
...it's gonna be okay!
No, one man for the rest of my life? I don't know if I can do it! This means I'll never get to sleep with Joey!
Very good! Drawing on your own experience, I like that!
Thanks!
I can't! It's too late! Terry already hired that girl over there. Look at her, she's even got waitress experience. Last night she was teaching everybody how to make napkin.... swans.
This is the worst Christmas ever.
Y'know what Rach, maybe you should just, y'know stay here at the coffee house.
That word was swans.
Well seeing that drunk Santa wet himself, really perked up my Christmas.
No! No! No! No it's not! No it's not! Come on! Phoebe, ours is totally different! I mean we don't have the... We don't have the...that lamp! And-and that screen is y'know, on the other side.
Ugh, those bastards! Let's go.
That fan kinda looks like ours. And the birdcage and the...wait a sec! This is our exact living room!
Oh my God. This is where you got all our stuff, Pottery Barn! Oh my God!
Okay! Okay-okay look-no I did, I just wanted this stuff and I know how you feel about Pottery Barn. Just... Come on don't be mad.
No! It didn't! That's what I want to talk to you about. Now, just to brief you... I may cry, but they are not tears of sadness or of anger, but just of me having this discussion with you.
Umm, Joanna? I wanna talk about that interview.
I thought it went very well.
Rachel, please, don't make a scene.
There's nobody here!
That's also the smaller piece. Okay, there you go. Enjoy your half my friend, but that is it. No sharing. No switching, and don't come crying to me if you eat your piece to fast. Oh!!!!
Oh for God sake just pick a piece!
All right, I'll pick that one.
Ohhh!
Okay, you gotta give me some of your piece.
What? What are you talking about?! You-you're the one who's been telling me to get over Ross and move on. I'm moving on, and you're moving on with me. Come on, give me one good reason why you don't wanna go.
Anyway, they want to take us out Saturday night! What do you say?
Umm. Umm. Umm. I don't think so.
Umm, why don't you give me something that would be a good reason and-and then I'll tell you if it's true.
What?
All right, would-would you mind just not going out with him again? Okay, just the idea of you and he and all these women, it's just-And I know he's my assistant and I can't date him-but it just bothers me, all right?!
Hey well, you can't teach someone to be good with women. Y'know, that's why I never had any luck with Chandler.
I'm right here!
Hey! No-no-no-no, you can't take him away from me! I got a great partner to pick up girls with! Finally!!
I'm still right here!
Well, I mean, are you sure you want to go out with her? I mean that ain't a pretty picture in the morning, y'know what I mean. That wig all in disarray, and boobs flung over the night stand, y'know.
Aww, the only reason you want to go out with me because my blond wig, and the big boobs, and the fact that I serve you food.
Well, if that were true, I'd dating my Aunt Ruth. And the two times we went out were just plain awkward. Come on, you think she should go out with me, don't you?
I mean really, think about it.
Ho-ho, I will.
Well y'know, it's you guys. You-you do this kind of stuff! Y'know? I mean, you-you were gonna get married in Vegas and then you backed out! I guess I'm not upset because I don't see you guys going through with it. I'm sorry.
All right, fine, but don't get mad at me. It's-it's just a little hard to believe.
What's hard to believe?
Rachel, it's going to happen. Chandler is gonna move in here.
But I...
Oh, yeah, sure. I mean, like in the case of this young woman, she has lost her clothes, so she rides naked on the horse, she's crying out, 'Where are they, where are they?'
Oh, I want to look too! . Yikes!
So do you think that these pictures-Are, are they trying to tell a story?
Well, she's not going to find them lying in the grass like that.
Oh, yeah. Aw, remember the days when you used to go out to the barn, lift up your shirt, and bend over?
I-I don't want your job. I-I don't. Ohh this is such a mistake. I did not make out with him. Nobody made out with him. I did not use my keycard yesterday. I don't even know how to use my keycard.
Oh no, no, no. Oh God, you think I made out with him.
Listen to me. If you think sleeping with Ralph is going to get you my job. You are sadly mistaken.
Hi Ralph.
Hi Kim.
Oh yeah, I don't care how much she tells you she wants it, I don't care if begs, she pleads, she tells you she, she's gonna have sex with, with another man. That just means it's working.
Yes, absolutely. I would wait and wait. . . then I'd wait some more.
Really?
Women really want this?
More than jewelry.
Hey-hey, y'know what? I don't care! I'm not ashamed of my book. There's nothing with a woman enjoying a little...erotica. It's just a healthy expression of female sexuality, which by the way, you will never understand.
Joey, what-what are you doing going into my bedroom?!
Okay, look I'm sorry, I went in there to take a nap and I know I shouldn't have, but you got porn!
You got porn!
Hello.
Except it didn't. It happened to me. Oh, god, I'm gonna look like a big marshmallow peep. What am I doing? What am I doing? My father's right. I can't live on my own! I can't even do laundry!
Oh, everything's pink.
Yeah, uh, except for the red sock, which is still red. I'm sorry, please don't be upset, it could happen to anyone.
Something went wrong with Underdog, and they couldn't get his head to inflate. So anyway, um, his head is like flopping down Broadway, right, and I'm just thinking... how inappropriate this is. Um, I've got something in my eye, uh, Joey, could we check it in the light, please?
Oh my god.
Okay, here we go. I'm Jabba's prisoner, and you have a really weird look on your face. What? Honey, what is it? Did I get it wrong? Did I get the hair wrong? What? Did you just picture it differently? What? What?
I think so.
Honey, relationships are hard. Like with your Mom and me. You know after we graduated college we broke up for a while. It seems her Father, your Grandfather, wanted her to travel around Europe, like he did. Of course, he got to do it on Uncle Sam's nickel, because he was also strafing German troop trains at the time. However,
No, no it's, um, it's not you, um, it's um, it's
Well what is it? Come on sweetie, your like, freaking me out here.
You're right! I mean you're right! It wasn't just the Weebles, but it was the Weeble Play Palace, and and the Weebles' Cruise Ship. Oh, which had this little lifeboat for the Weebles to wobble in.
Y'know, all these years, I thought you were on my side. But maybe what you were doing was sucking up to Mom and Dad so they'd keep liking you better!
Hey, I married a lesbian to make you look good!
That's tough. Tough stuff. C'mon, Pheebs, we're gonna catch that movie, we gotta get going.
Oh, okay. Feel better, Rachel, 'kay?
But, Pheebs, you can still use the copy machine where I actually work. But, just come by at lunch so my boss doesn't see you. Cause Kim will just freak out and she already doesn't like me very much.
Yeah. A year ago..
You've lasted a whole year. Good for you.
That's weird. I don't think my boss likes me either.
I don't think mine likes me either.
Oh my God! I bet that's him. My digital fairy tale is about to begin. I wonder how I should be? Should I be uh Hello? Or should I be Hi! It's Rach... Would you stop doing that?!
Oh is it?! Uhh, hello? Yes hi, is Rachel there? Yes she is, just one moment please. It's for me!
That is damning evidence.
Hello? Yes, I'm the one who found your phone.
Phoebe! You can't do th...
Okay fine! I'll-I'll just tell her it's an antique apothecary table, she doesn't have to know where it came from. Oh! Look at this little drawers! Oh look-look it says that it holds 300 CDs.
Yeah! I made it of this fruit bowl I found in the garbage.
I'm telling-If you put that in her apartment you'll never hear the end of it.
Ahh, just like the apothecary tables of yore...
...so then the farmer says, "That's not a cow and you're not milking it."
What? Uhh, Phoebe, honey, honey, I know you're quirky and I get a big kick out of it, we all do actually, but if you destroy a coat like this that is like a crime against nature! Not nature, fashion!
Oh my God! Oh my God, look at these pelts!
Don't get too attached, she's having it cremated.
This is fashion?! Okay, so to you, death is fashion?! That's really funny. Here's Phoebe umm, sporting uh, y'know, cutting edge hairy carcass from y'know, the steal traps of wintry Russia. I mean, you really thing this looks good? 'Cause I do.
I know I miss you too. I can't wait to see you. I love you. Bye.
Yes! I will! Absolutely! Hello, Rachel. Hi, Joshua. I left my wallet here on purpose. Really? Yes, I just wanted to see you again. Oh, I'm glad. Rachel, I'd like to say something to you. Yes? How you doin'?
Really?
Will you call him?
So now, what is this now?
Guggly worm.
Joey no, this is wrong! You have to take it back, okay? You don't want to win an award this way. You're very talented. And someday you're gonna win one of these for real and that one is gonna mean something.
Joey is says Best Supporting Actress!
I can scratch that right off.
All right!
All right? Thank you.
Oh, what are you going to do?! Are you gonna go run tell Monica?! Are you gonna tell Joey?! No! Because then you will have to tell them what we did! We are desert stealers! We are living outside the law!
Mm-mmm.
I will give you a hundred dollars to whistle right now. How can you eat the cheesecake without me?!
Y'know what? I don't trust you with this cake anymore! And I got it first, and I'm takin' it back!
What?! What?!
Yeah, maybe, but I don't think I even care. I don't think he's the one I'm sad about. Y'know, I know that I said that I am totally okay with Ross getting married, but as it turns out, I don't think I'm handling it all that well.
Well uh, his answering machine was very understanding. Ugh. I feel blue.
Ohh, sweetie! Hey, I bet you anything that he's gonna call you again.
Yeah, maybe.
And I-I am just trying to figure out why.
See? Yeah, you told me the story. He and Monica dated when they broke up they couldn't even be in the same room together and you all promised that you would stay his friend and what happened? He got phased out!
Kip, my old roommate, y'know we all used to hang out together.
Oh, that poor bastard.
You're not gonna be phased out!
Well, of course I am! It's not gonna happen to Ross! He's your brother. He's your old college roommate. Ugh, it was just a matter of time before someone had to leave the group. I just always assumed Phoebe would be the one to go.
It was like months ago. We were walking by this antique store, and I saw this pin in the window, and I told him it was just like one my grandmother had when I was a little girl. Oh! I can't believe he remembered!
Oh... ... Oh my God. He remembered.
Remembered what?
Well, sure, but can you play it on a plane?
Oh, it's so pretty. This must have cost him a fortune.
Oh, I thought you guys meant marijuana cigarettes, y'know? Y'know what I mean, like dubbies? And I actually, I thought to myself, "Wow, those guys are crazy!" But no, I actually smoke the regular ones all, all the time.
Excuse me, can I, can I bum one of those? Y'know what, actually... Okay, okay, okay, what's so funny over here?
I thought you didn't smoke.
We get high.
Oh, me too.
Ya know, I mean this is supposed to be a joyous occasion. My sister's graduating from college, nobody thought she would. It's a true testament to what a girl from long island would do for a Celica.
Agh, it was the graduation from hell.
Ya know, my cousin went to hell on a football scholarship.
So what happened?
My parents happened. All they had to do was sit in the same stadium, smile proudly, and not talk about the divorce. But nooo, they got into a huge fight in the middle of the commencement address. Bishop Tutu actually had to stop and shush them. But you know what, you know what the good news is? I get to serve coffee for the next 8 hours.
But y'know what, if you think it's gonna be okay we'll just work out a system. Y'know, it'll be like college, I'll hang a hanger on the door and put a sign, "Come back later, I'm gettin' lucky."
Yeah! I'm gonna have a boyfriend, you're gonna have a girlfriend...
Ohh! That would be great.
Yeah, I didn't think of that.
So are you sure about this whole moving in thing?! I mean it's a really big step! And-and what's the rush?!
It was like months ago. We were walking by this antique store, and I saw this pin in the window, and I told him that it was just like one my grandmother had when I was a little girl. Oh! I can't believe he remembered!
Oh... Oh my God. He remembered.
Remembered what?
Oh, it's so pretty. This must have cost him a fortune.
I can't believe he did this.
I know, I know, I know, I know. I was just thinking about when they were there the last time, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. OK, OK, look, woah, I promise, I'm good, I'm not gonna laugh anymore. OK put your hands back there.
OK.
OK, my hands were no where near your butt.
No see now, now I can't because uh, I'm feeling too self conscious.
Just one cheek.
Yes I did! And I put a little Post-It on it that said, "Must go out today," and underlined today three times and, and then I put a little heart in the corner because I didn't want to seem to bossy.
Y'know, like the thing when you put the phone in your pants? Tag! I'm serious! This isn't funny! Those contracts absolutely had to go out today!
Rach, I'm sorry, but you didn't give me any contracts!
I'm telling you, you never gave them to me.
Y'know what Tag, if we went down to the office you would see those contracts sitting on your desk.
This is a very critical time right now. If you feel yourself reaching for that phone, then you go shoe shopping, you get your butt in a bubble bath. You want her back you have to start acting aloof.
Okay, okay. So, should I call her?
Nooo!
She has to know that your not ready.
Right. So, what you have to do is, you have to accidentally run into her on purpose. And then act aloof.
And then, I don't know, I mean you'd pull me really close to you so that, so that I'd be pressed up, you know, right against you. And, um, it would get kind of sweaty and uh, and blurry, and then it's just happening.
Yeah, I mean, you know it, I mean, if it were me I, I, you know, I'd want you to, I don't know, like catch me off guard, you know, with like a really good kiss, you know really, sort of um, soft at first, then maybe um brush the hair away from my face, and look far into my eyes in a way that let's me know that something amazing is about to happen.
Uh-huh.
Ohh. . . Thanks Rach, goodnight.
Ohh, God.
Well, I just checked our messages and Joshua didn't call. I mean you'd think he'd be worried about me not showing up at his club. Ugh, you know what makes it so much worse, Ross is all happy in Vermont!
Very good, so good.
I really, really enjoyed it. Very exotic.
Come on! Look where you are!!
When you get a sec, another round of daiquiris.
I know! I know, she says it's all mass-produced, nothing is authentic, and everyone winds up having the same stuff. So come on, she's gonna be here any second! Can we please just cover this up with something?! Please?
Because she hates Pottery Barn.
She hates Pottery Barn?!!
What? No! No! I am not gonna hide it from Phoebe-Ooh, although I did get some great Pottery Barn sheets!
Ooo! Oh, I forgot they made sheets!
Oh my god. Ok you guys, there's Danny. Watch. Just watch this. See?! Still pretending he's not interested. Ohh, he's coming over. Just pretend like we don't know him. We've forgotten who he is.
So Pheebs, where are you doing all, your bell ringing?
Ohh, they gave me a great spot. Right by Macys. Yeah, they hardly ever give such a good spot to a rookie, but I'm the only one who can sing "Merry Christmas" in 25 languages. I lied.
Hey guys.
Hey Danny.
Please. I haven't heard from her in seven months, and now she calls me? I mean, what else is it about? Oh! She was my best friend, you guys! We went to camp together... she taught me how to kiss..
Thanks, but I gotta go to work and get my eyes scratched out by Mindy.
Relax. Y'know, she may not even know.
Yeah?
And now, y'know, I'm like... I'm like the other woman! I feel so..
Yeah, I know. I had the greatest day though, I got to sit in on the meeting with the reps from Calvin Klien. I told my boss I liked this line of lingerie, she ordered a ton of it. How was your day?
Do you have any ice?
Check the freezer. If there's none in there, then we're probably out. Are you just getting in from work? It's late.
I discovered I'm able to count all of my teeth using just my tongue.
Hmm. Umm, why do you have a copy of The Shining in your freezer?
No, really. Really, Pheebs, you're not gonna be the one worrying about saving for college, or yelling at them when they're bad, y'know, or deciding to put them on Ritalin when they just won't calm down. Y'know?
Aww, sweetie, but it's not like you're not gonna have anything. You're gonna have nieces and nephews, and some ways that's even better.
Yeah, okay.
I mean, you're the one they're gonna come to when they wanna run away from home, and the one they talk to about sex.
And you just get to be cool Aunt Phoebe!
Ross, I said I'm sorry like a million times. What do you want me to do? You want me to break my foot too? Okay, I'm gonna break my foot, right here. Ow!! Oh! Oh my God, oh my God! There, are you happy now?!
Ross, you don't know that.
Oh come on. It's cold, it's dark, he doesn't know the Village. And now I have a broken foot. I have no monkey, and a broken foot! Thank you very much.
Yeah, yeah. Y'know, now that you kicked the sign, hey! I don't miss Marcel any more!
Y'know, it is not like I did this on purpose.
Well y'know, we would umm, repeat everything the other said, or uh, we'd jump out of closets to scare each other, or switch the sugar for the salt so they'd put salt on their cereal.
Oh, you're one of those. But y'know what? I have two sisters of my own and we just-just tortured each other.
Really? Like how?
That's a good one.
Yeah? You like that one?
In the afternoon. Mr. Zelner came into my office after lunch. He put them on my desk, and then I put a Post-It on it that said, "Must go out today." So you just keep looking in there! All right?
Okay, very cute braces. Anyway y'know what, the point is Tag, start looking because you are going to find those contracts on your desk.
So when do you imagine you gave them to me? In the morning or in the afternoon?
It's not here.
Puzzler. A bit of a puzzle. Why don't you um, check the copy room, maybe you left the contracts in there?
It was cheesecake. It was fine. It had a buttery, crumbly, graham cracker crust, with a very rich yet light, cream cheese filling... Wow! My whole mouth just filled with saliva!
Are you serious?! Chandler, we ate an entire cheesecake two days ago and you want more?
Well I've forgotten what it tastes like okay?!
Y'know what? Forget it! We are just hungry! We have not had lunch! We are just light-headed! So let us go out and have lunch and forget about the cheesecake.
Yeah and we'll drop it off downstairs so that we're not tempted.
No, y'know what? It's gonna be okay. I mean you don't have to have this rustic Italian feast. Y'know? And-and you don't need, you don't need this custom-made, empire waisted, duchess, satin gown; you can wear off the rack.
Honey, it's gonna be okay.
No! No it's not! It's not gonna be okay! It sucks! No swing band! No lilies!
Look, it really is gonna be okay. The important thing is that we love each other and that we're gonna get married.
Do you even understand what off the rack means?!
Yeah I know. She ran into him at my office and they just...made out. And the craziest thing is, now my boss likes me because I told her about it and she said it was the best gossip she'd heard all year.
What???
Oh my god.
I am proud of all my friends today.
My God, Rachel, I can't believe Phoebe made out with Ralph Lauren. Ohh, I'm so jealous.
Let me uh, let me ask you something, do wedding vows mean squat to you people?! And why is it that the second we tell you we're going out of town, bamn there you are in bed with the neighbor's dog walker?!
Sit down!
Okay.
We're sorry.
No seriously! Seriously! What has happened to the sanctity of marriage?
Yeah, I went to a wedding once where they had swing music and uh, two months later the couple got divorced. And now I'm not saying that there's any connection here y'know, but they did tell me that's why they got divorced.
What are you guys talking about?
Well umm, we were just talking about the y'know, the Swing Kings and just wondering whether y'know, they were the right way to go.
But I love swing music!
Yeah but the Swing Kings? Y'know they suck so much that people actually die at their concerts-They just stop living.
Oh, I wish he was a doll, then I could get a Rachel doll and bump them together and make kissy noises. Oh! And he has the most beautiful name, I never realised it, Joshua! Josh-u-a! Joshua! Josh.
I have the best job in the entire world! The most adorable guy came over today, and I got to dress him up all day!
Rachel has a new doll.
Uh, hello!
Hi-e!!
God, isn't this exciting? I earned this. I wiped tables for it, I steamed milk for it, and it was totally not worth it. Who's FICA? Why's he getting all my money? I mean, what- Chandler, look at that.
Wow, you worked in a mine?
I worked in a Dairy Queen, why?
Oh, this is not that bad.
Oh, you're fine, yeah, for a first job.
Oh, and then, we got into this big, stupid fight. I just, it was awful. I told him he treats me like a park ranger, or something, oh and then I told him I wanted to take a break, I don't want to take a break.
Why? What happened to him?
Nothing, he's just really believes in that.
Wow. I'm sorry. Eggroll?
No. And then I called him, and he wasn't there.
Well, of course I am! It's not gonna happen to Ross! He's your brother. He's your old college roommate. Ugh, it was just a matter of time before someone had to leave the group. I just always assumed Phoebe would be the one to go.
See? Yeah, you told me the story. He and Monica dated when they broke up they couldn't even be in the same room together and you all promised that you would stay his friend and what happened? He got phased out!
You're not gonna be phased out!
Ehh!!
Honey, come on! You live far away! You're not related. You lift right out.
Yeah, and also we need more umm, drinks. Hold on a second. Whup, okay. Hello! Vegas? Yeah, we would like some more alcohol, and y'know what else? We would like some more beers. Hello? Ohh, I forgot to dial!
Hit me. Hit me. Hit me. Hit me. Hit me. Hit me. Hit me.
We need more cards.
That must be our alcohol and beers!
Hey!
Ok, you know what, lemme, let me just see what else I can do. All right, look, look. Why don't you just let her go on after Stephanie whatever-her-name-is. I mean, you won't even be here. You don't pay her. It's not gonna cost you anything.
Terry is a jerk, ok? That's why we're always saying "Terry's a jerk!" That's where that came from.
Yeah, ok. You probably did everything you could.
I, I don't know.
Come on, Terry, I'll even clean the cappuccino machine.
Come on Phoebe, look at that! They are not breaking up, look at them. Okay that's, you know what that is? That is a, that is a second date, that's what that is! Look at that, she just put her hand on his thigh...
Phoebe!
Right, oh yeah. Wow, oh, it looks like Ross is breaking up with her. Uff, I hope he lets her down easy. Let's go.
Oh no! That really is nothing, she is very sexually aggressive.
Ohh! Phoebe, this is all your fault! Now he loves her, he's gonna marry her, and this is all your fault.
I don't care! I don't care! You are going to have to take her out again and end it, and end it in way that she knows it's actually ended. And, I don't care how hard it is for you, do not tell her that you will call her again!
Well then you're going to have to take her out again.
Nooo!! She's really dull! And she gets this gross mascara goop thing in the corner of her eye!
All right! Fine! But it's just a lunch date, no more than an hour! And from now on I get my own dates, I don't want you setting me up with anybody ever again!
That's fine!
Well of course we will help you decide! We will do anything we can to help you! Now, I would like to make a toast, to the future Mrs. Chandler Bing , my best friend, and truly one of the nicest people that...
Wh-why is that the best part?
Because then I don't have to!
I'm really not deciding!
Fine!
No! None! I mean, my first night in the city, he mentioned something about asking me out, but nothing ever happened, so I just... : W-well, what else did he say? I mean, does he, like, want to go out with me?
OK, is there a mute button on this woman?
I think this is so great! I mean, you and Ross! D-did you have any idea?
Well, given that he's desperately in love with you, he probably wouldn't mind getting a cup of coffee or something.
Ross? All this time? Well, I've got to talk to him.
What?! Wait a minute! No wait a minute! Okay? Look, that night was the one wild thing I have ever done in my entire life, and I'm not gonna let you take that away from me! Okay, so if you don't remember that, maybe you will remember this!
It happened! I am telling you it happened!
Okay. Well, it was great meeting you. And uh Rachel, I-I don't think I'll be calling you because umm, y'know you've gotten weird. Take care you guys.
My God! You love me!
What?
Yeah, when I was in the bathroom I saw the window that I crawled out of at my wedding, and God, I just started thinking that I shouldn't be here, you know I shouldn't, people are going to be looking at me and judging me and, and thinking about the last time.
Hi.
Are you all right?
Sweetie, it's be gonna okay, all right. It's a wedding, generally people focus on the bride.
God I know, you're right.
Yeah that's great Paul, but y'know I wanna know what--Wow, those are really great! I just wanna know what, what is behind this-this strong, silent exterior. Y'know they say that still waters run deep and I wanna swim in yours.
Okay. Hey, what are you thinking? What are you thinking right now?
I'm thinking that you are looking really fine it that dress.
Are you talking about having sex?
No Paul, I don't know anything about you! Y'know, like-like your childhood! Tell me about your childhood!
That's right! 'Cause that would give him the control! So now he's all ooh, coming up with this whole I've got a party thing y'know, trying to get me to hint around for an invitation. Blew up in his face, didn't it?
Okay. All right, I see what he's doing! He's not asking me out, because he wants me to ask him out.
And you're not gonna do that.
So-so there is no party.
No, there's a party. There's a party. But the power, that is still up for grabs. You follow me?
Okay sir, um-mm, let see if I got this right. Ah, so this is a half-caf, double tall, easy hazel nut, non-fat, no foam, with whip, extra hot latte, right? Okay, great. You freak.
Yeah, y'know what I got a better idea. How-how 'bout it blocks none of mine door and a lot of yours?
Yeah, listen, before I forget that side is still wet.
Thank you.
Um, coffee to go, please.
Ok, ok, ok. How did this happen to me? How did this happen to me? A week ago, two weeks ago, I was fine. Ross was just Ross, just this guy. Now he's Rrrooossss, oh, this really great guy that I can't have.
Okay!
Hi? Sorry, we got disconnected...
Sweetie, I wanted you to have him too.
I know you did. I'm just gonna deal with it, I'm just gonna deal with it. I gotta get out of here.
Look Joey, I'm sorry if-if you thought that was mean, but I gotta tell ya something. That was not mean. Okay, my father is mean. He used to yell at me all the time on the boat, I mean it was horrible. I was just being a good teacher.
Excuse me, I wanted you to help, but you couldn't move your arms because you were wearing three life jackets.
You have to respect the sea!
Does a good teacher say, "Put down the beer pinhead!?"
Well, does a good student drink seven beers during his first lesson?
Ohh, gosh. You guys, come on, this is-I have to meet Joshua! This is my one chance for him to see the fun Rachel. Y'know the "Wouldn't it be great if she was my wife" Rachel. Ohh, all right! Are Joey and Chandler back?
Ugh!
Unless! She wants to spend the night holding my hair back for me.
No, Chandler's still in Phase One, and Joey's that thing you smell.
Ohh! Hi!
Well Joey, you'll probably get it. But you should probably your-your gracious loser face. Y'know when like the cameras are on you and you wanna look disappointed but also that your colleague deserved to win. Y'know? So it's sorta like...
Well of course I do! But y'know, favorite returning character is a tough category Joey. I mean you're up against the guy who survived his own cremation.
Yeah. No-no I-I know I might not win, but it's just...I've never even been nominated before! I want it so much.
Hey!
Y'know?
I mean, it's a cat, y'know, it's a cat. Why can't they get one of those bugs, y'know, one of those fruitflies, those things that live for like a day or something? What're they called, what're they called, what're they called?
Phoebs look, if you want to know what the deal is, you're just gonna have to ask him.
You're right, you're right. Ah, you are so yumm.
Fruitflies?
Yes! Thank you.
Ohhh well. Y'know what honey? The best thing to do to get over a guy is to start dating someone else. Oh! There is this great guy you will love at work named Bob! He's a real up-and-comer in Human Resources.
Hey!
You'll never believe what just happened, Ross just totally blew me off and he didn't even tell me why!
Y'know, thanks for trying to cheer me up, but I'm not gonna date some random guy from your work.
It's not random, it's Bob.
Hey-whoa-whoa-whoa!! Ho-ho-hold on a sec there, Mr. Kissey! Y'know, I've been meaning to talk to you about this whole, little, new European thing you got going on, and I just need to tell you that it makes me very uncomfortable and I just-y'know-stop it!
That sucks! That's not a trip! I just came from the park! What are we gonna high five about at the stupid Central Park? "Well, it's right by my house, all right!"
Well, I'm gonna go home and bask in the triumph of my Central Park idea.
I was just trying to bring a little culture to the group.
That's fine, just don't bring it in my mouth.
No, you don't, Ross. Imagine the worst things you think about yourself. Now, how would you feel if the one person that you trusted the most in the world not only thinks them too, but actually uses them as reasons not to be with you.
No, you guys, you really don't have to go, we're done talking.
Rach, come on, look, I know how you must feel.
No, but, but I wanna be with you in spite of all those things.
Oh, well, that's, that's mighty big of you, Ross. I said don't go!
Ohh, okay, I'm sorry. You're right. Y'know what? We absolutely can stay married, because I was under the impression that the boxes were far away from each other. All right, look, just please, take a moment here and think about what you're asking of me.
What-wh-what so we'll just stay married forever?!
Okay, look, how is this gonna affect you? Really? I mean you fill some form out once and a while and instead of checking the box that says Ms you check the box that says Mrs.! It's right next to it!
I'm asking you to do me a favor.
You are asking me to be your wife!
Hi! Uhh, do you guys have plans for the weekend? Because I have my sister on hold, and she said that we could use her cabin for the weekend and go skiing. Huh? I'm asking you first, right?!. I mean I'm playing by the rules.
Him? Him, Ross?
Nope, hymn 253, His Eyes Are On The Sparrow! When my parents got divorced is when I started using humour as a defence mechanism.
Absolutely, yeah!
Chandler! You're smoking? What are you doing?!
Op, look! Claire forgot her glasses! And she's gonna be really needing these to keep an eye on that boyfriend, who, I hear, needs to keep his stapler in his desk drawer, if you know what I'm talking about.
Well, I taught me and I love me.
Yeah that'd be great! Thanks Pheebs!
Hey Rach, maybe your resolution should be to umm, gossip less.
I don't gossip!
Yeah, but he waited until the last minute! So if I said yes, he would know I had nothing better to do than wait around for an invitation to his stupid party. I said, "No!" Which puts me right back in the driver seat.
Okay. Walked right into that one didn't he?
What one? You wanted him to invite you to the party and he did it!
Great. So the ball is in his court?
Ball? There is no ball.
Ok, doggie get the- aahhh. Ok go get the sandwich, get the sandwich doggie. Good doggie get the sandwich, get the...ok, Joey, the dog will lick himself but he will not touch your sandwich, what does that say?
Ok, here, I know what we can do.
Hey, hey, hey no.
Well if he's not gonna eat it, I will.
Are you crazy?
I believe you. So, it was right in the middle of a staff meeting so of course no one else wants to correct her so everyone else is calling me Raquel! By the end of the day, the mailroom guys were calling me Rocky!
Ugh, the worse day! Y'know, you think you're making progress at work and then your boss calls you Raquel.
Hey listen, for the first four years of my work everybody called me Sha-la-lap. Seriously.
Well, I-I still think you're very-very nice and very pretty...
What?
Okay, well then how about puberty! Come on, that's always a painful time! Y'know your friends invite you to a slumber party and then they stick your hand in warm water while you're sleeping so that you pee in your sleeping bag.
No Paul, I don't know anything about you! Y'know, like-like your childhood! Tell me about your childhood!
Normal.
Nope! That never happened to me!
Well, you're lucky you never met that bitch Sharon Majesky. Anyway, umm... The rest of you life, y'know? Any regrets?
Why didn't he call? He's gonna stay with Julie, isn't he? He's gonna stay with her and she's going to be all, "Hi, I'm Julie, Ross picked me, and we're gonna to get married, have a lot of kids and dig up stuff together."
Did uh, Ross call?
No, I'm sorry.
No offense, but that sounds nothing like her.
I don't know what to do. What am I gonna do? I mean, this, this is like a complete nightmare.
So, if I wanna have my kid when I'm 35, I don't have to get pregnant until I'm 34. Which gives Prada four years to start making maternity clothes! Oh wait, but I do want to be married for a year before I get pregnant...
As I was saying... I should probably have the first of the three kids by the time I'm 35 which gives me five years. I love this plan! I wanna marry this plan!
If you could do that, I'd marry the hippity-hop.
Really! That long?! Look all you want, it's happening!
No, so I don't have to get married until I'm 33! That's three years, that's three whole years-Oh, wait a minute though. I'll need a year and a half to plan the wedding, and I'd like to know the guy for a year, year and a half before we get engaged... Which means I need to meet the guy by the time I'm thirty.
Fine. Fine, but I'll have you know that once I taught him that stuff he called me Fun Aunt Rachel. And I loved being Fun Aunt Rachel but I'll go back to being Boring and Uncomfortable Aunt Rachel if that's what you want!
That was you?! We heard about you in Junior High! Did you really just shake your fist in the air and shout, "I will be revenged?!"
I will be! Listen, I don't want you teaching my son that stuff anymore. Okay?
No that's not what I want. Uh, I'm glad you guys were bonding but I...
Look he doesn't have any brothers or sisters, somebody's gonna have to teach him this stuff! And I haven't taught him anything that a normal 6-year-old doesn't know anyway!
Well okay, how about four hours in a freezing museum auditorium listening to Professor Pitstains and he's 'Hey everybody! Remember that thing that's been dead for a gazillion years. Well there's this little bone we didn't know it had!'
Nodded off!! Ross you were snoring. My father's boat didn't make that much noise when it hit rocks!
Come on! Forty-five minutes! Forty-five minutes the man talked about strappy backed dresses.
First of all it's Professor Pittain! And second of all, that little bone, proved that, that particular dinosaur had wings, but didn't fly.
Okay, see now, what I just heard, blah-blah-blah, blah-blah-blah-blah-blah, blah-blah-blah, blah, blah.
Yes, but I, I think about who's apartment we're gonna sleep at tomorrow night and, and where we're gonna have dinner next Saturday night. I do not think about what our childrens' names are gonna be. You know what our childrens names are gonna be.
Ross, you have planned out the next 20 years of our lives, we've been dating for six weeks.
C'mon, what, you never think about our future?
No, no, I mean, ya know, I, I read a book and there was a girl named Emily and I thought, I thought that might be good.
What was the book?
I just don't want him to meet anybody until I am over my crush-And I will get over it. It's-it's not like I love him, it's just physical! But-I mean I get crushes like this all the time! I mean hell, I had a crush on you when I first met ya!
All right, will you, will you at least tell him how hollow and unsatisfying this, dating tons of women thing is!
What?!
I know, Monica told me.
Did you have a crush on me, when you first met me?
No, no don't get mad because look-this is what happened. So I-I started packing, then I realized, "What am I doing? I am lousy at packing!" Right? But you love packing! So, as a gift to you, on our last night, ta-da!
Surprise!!
What?
I'll be coordinator! Oh my God! I'm so sorry, I didn't get you anything! Okay, look everybody has to help! Okay? You can help, can't you Phoebe?
I have plans.
Oh my God Phoebe, this is impossible! We can't do this by Friday! We have to find a place. We have to invite people! We have to get food! There's just too much to do! It's impossible! We can't do it! We cannot do it! We cannot do it!
Yesterday!
Well if we make it yesterday, woo-hoo! We're done!
Rachel, calm down!
Okay. I'm sorry. You're right, you're right.
Well. Woah, look at that! I gotta go, I gotta date. With a man. Um, OK, you guys have a really, uh, have a really good night and you two have a, uh, have a, uh, really good cat. OK, we're not supposed to take these when we leave.
Ohh, well, isn't that just lovely. That's something the two of you will be able to enjoy for a really, really, really, really, really long time.
Hopefully.
I don't know if Monica told you but this is the first date I've gone on since my divorce so, if I seem a little nervous, I am.
How long do cats live?
Fine! I judged you. I made a snap judgement. But you did it too! And you are worse because you are sticking to your stupid snap judgement! You can't even open up your mind for a second to see if you're wrong! What does that say about you?
And stop saying that! I hate that!
Okay!
The pizza-place across the street any good?
What?!
Honey see, it doesn't mean that I don't love you. Because I do. I love you, I love you so much. But my work it's-it's for me y'know, I'm out there, on my own, and I'm doing it and it's scary but I love it, because it's mine. I, but, I mean is that okay?
It's not dumb. But, maybe it's okay that you're not a part of it. Y'know what I mean? I mean it's like, I-I-I like that you're not involved in that part of my life.
That's a little clearer.
Sure, I-I-I...
Your thinking about my leg aren't you?
Oh, I don't know. I guess it's not about no guys, it's about the right guy, y'know? I mean, with Barry, it was safe and it was easy, but there was no heat. With Paolo, that's all there was, was heat! And it was just this raw, animal, sexual...
No. Oh, oh, I guess it would be different if I were- with somebody.
Whoah, uh, what happened to, uh, 'Forget relationships! I'm done with men!' The whole, uh, penis embargo?
Wait-wait. I, I got it. I was there.
Well, I mean, do you think you can ever have both? Y'know? Someone who's like, who's like your best friend, but then also can make your toes curl?
It's so that I can spend Thanksgiving with my family. See, every year we go skiing in Vail, and normally my father pays for my ticket, but I sort of started the whole independence thing, you know, which is actually why I took this job.
Terry, I, I, I know that I haven't worked here very long, but I was wondering, do you think it would be possible if I got a $100 advance in my salary?
An advance?
Rachel, Rachel, sweetheart. You're a terrible, terrible waitress. Really, really awful.
Ok, I, I hear what you're sayin'. I'm with you. Um, but I, but I'm trying really hard. And I think I'm doing better. I really do. Does anybody need coffee? Oh, look at that.
Now I'm mommy in this little play? Alright look, I refuse to get sucked into this like, weird little Geller dimension thing OK. So I'm gonna go and take a nice long hot bubble bath because you kids are driving me crazy.
Well, Monica keeps changin' the channel.
Oh that's great, why don't you tell mommy on me.
OK, what're we gonna do about this?
Well, I guess we could tape Entertainment Tonight.
Okay, well then how about a handshake? Oh God I'm sorry! Oh God, I'm sorry! I did not mean to touch that-I mean you there. There. Uhh, okay, so thank-thank you, I'm going to leave now thank you very much uh-huh, thank you so-Hey! I'll see you Monday!
Really? Oh thank you! Oh... Oh, would it be completely inappropriate to give you a hug?
Yes!
You tired Chandler?
You better believe he's tired, after the day we had! If you know what I mean. You know what I mean?
Oh how can you possibly know? Look at this mess, Tag! I mean, this is what I'm talking about! You have to be organized! You've got newspapers! You've got magazines! You got-Ohh! And who is this chippy? A little young for you Tag, but whatever.
Ohh! Ohhhh! Were you sleeping sweetie? I'm sorry. Here.
Okay! Feel free to look, but I'm telling you those contracts are not on this desk.
It's my sister.
Okay, very cute braces. Anyway y'know what, the point is Tag, start looking because you are going to find those contracts on your desk.
What if, um, if he calls his own cell phone to find out who found it and I answer and we start talking and we fell in love. I mean wouldn't that be a great story? Kind of like a fairy tale for the digital age.
Oh, well, we can hand it to Gunther and he'll put it in lost and found.
Or we could use it to call China. See how those guys are doing.
Yeah... That does sound great. I'm going to get the phone.
What? Wait! Why...why do you get the story?
Pheebs, this whole apartment thing is just a nightmare! Every place I can afford comes with a roommate who is a freak. I mean, look at this; "Wanted. Female roommate, non-smoker, non-ugly." It's just, there is nothing! The city's full!
This one?
It worked!
Wait, no, look at this! "Two bedroom, two bath, must be non-smoker, Satan worshipers okay..." Oh, yeah, but it's on the ground floor.
Hey!
Okay. Okay, we'll be here! Hating you! Did you see how he was sweating when he walked out of there? Listen honey, if I'm hogging the ball too much you just jump right in there and take a couple punches because I'm telling you, this feels great.
Dr. Farber, we've got a bit of an emergency here...Jason Costalano is choking on his retainer.
Oh God... I'll be right there, Bernice. Look, please, please don't go anywhere, okay? I'll be, I'll be right back.
Yeah... I'm pretty sure I'm still gonna marry him.
What are you talking about?! Mindy, the guy is the devil! He's Satan in a smock!
Okay, I have to tell you something that I have never admitted during our entire friendship! But, when we were in high school I made out with James Farrell even when I knew that you liked him! Wow, that feels so good to get off my chest! Okay, you go!
I am gonna see her again.
Damnit Phoebe!!
My turn? What-what are you talking about?
Ugh, Monica, I know about you and Chandler.
I overheard you guys on the phone the other day, and you said, "I'll just tell Rachel that I'm doing laundry for a couple of hours." And he said, "Laundry? Is that my new nickname?" And you said, "No! You know what your nickname is, Mr. Big."
Ugh, Monica, I know about you and Chandler.
What?!
Well. Sounds like you're writing yourself a little play there Rach. Wow! Let me know how that one turns out.
Well, I wouldn't know because I got so freaked out that I hung up the phone.
This is it, isn't it? I mean, this is what my life is gonna be like. My mom there, my dad there. Thanksgiving, Christmas. She gets the house, he's in some condo my sister's gonna decorate with wicker. Oh, Chandler how did you get through this?
...what the hell does she want with half a boat...
Ok, ok, you can be shirts and I'll be skins. I'll be skins. Hey, how you holdin' up there, tiger? Oh, sorry, when my parents were getting divorced I got a lot of tigers. Got a lot of champs, chiefs, sports, I even got a governor.
Well, I relied on a carefully regimented program of denial and, and wetting the bed.
Ya know, I just, so weird. I mean I was in there just listening to them bitch about each other and all I kept thinking about was the fourth of July.
Okay-okay-okay-okay-okay-okay-okay! I got it! I got it! I got it! I can't! I can't! I can't! I cannot go with you and my sister thing. Okay? I just can't. It's just too weird, all right? I imagine the two of you together and I freak out. It freaks me out. I can't do it! I can't do it.
She asked-asked you out again?
Yeah-uh-huh. Tomorrow night, Valentine's Day, the most romantic day of the year. Who knows what could happen? I might not be shutting my drapes to show her my slides, if you know what I mean.
Okay! Okay! Okay! It's okay. It's okay. Hey, it's too weird for you, I won't see her again.
Thank you. I...yeah.
Oh, see now I feel bad for the kid! I had a crush on a teacher once and it was so hard! Y'know you-I couldn't concentrate and I blushed every time he looked at me. I mean come on, you remember what's it's like to be 19 and in love.
Not right now.
It-it-The point is my natural charisma has made him fail his midterm.
Yeah. I guess I can cut him some slack.
Yeah.
Okay, y'know what?! I know-I know how to settle this! All right here, this is what we're gonna do! I'm gonna write Joey on one napkin and I'm gonna right Ross on the other napkin and we are going to pick one! And that person is going to be our backup! Okay?
I'm talking about massages.
Oh.
Okay that's fair.
All right.
No! No! No! I'm not yelling at you, I'm just yelling near you. Oh God Joey, ohh I'm my father. Oh my God, this is horrible! I've been trying so hard not to be my mother I did not see this comin'. Oh, Joey, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I just wanted you to learn.
Oh my God, wait did I-I just said Greens don't quit didn't I? Did I just say Greens don't quit?!
Yes! Yes! You did and you're still yelling at me!
Well, hey I did learn.
Really?
Okay, Pheebs, y'know what, let's look at this objectively all right? Ninth grade, right? The obsession starts. All right? The summer after ninth grade he sees me in a two-piece for the first time, his obsession begins to grow. So then...
Well, Ross said my name.
Yeah, I know, but I don't think that means anything.
Hey, listen, why don't we go change in my room?
But my clothes are-ohh!
Chandler, that's not enough. I mean what if she gets you a great present, two medium presents, and a bunch of little presents? And you've just gotten her one great present? I mean that's just gonna make her feel bad. Why would you do that to her Chandler? Why? Why?
No, I have a great idea for a present for her.
Oh, that's it? A great idea!
If I help, we can find 'em faster!
That's right!
Oh, yeah! Real fun. Y'know, this bra... Really, bothers me. Y'know, this used to be my bedroom. Yeah. A lot of memories in here, a lot of memories. If these walls could talk, y'know what they'd say? Wanna hear some memories?
Rachel is my girlfriend.
So, this was uh, really fun.
Need uh, need a little hand there.
Oh no-no-no! No, I got this all under control.
But I do not want to have everything decided for me. I spent my whole life like that. It's what I had with Barry, that was one of the reasons I left. I, I like not knowing right now and I'm sorry if that scares you but if you want to be with me you are gonna have to deal with that.
Ok, Ross, Ross, ok listen, what we have is amazing.
Yeah.
Ok fine.
Thank you.
We have to have a surprise Bon Voyage party for Emily. But it's actually for Joshua. Look, he said he's not ready to date, so I had to invite him to a party if I wanted to see him outside of work, and now I have the perfect opportunity to seduce him!
What are you talking about?
Yeah, what' going on?
Well, as much as I'd like to meet Josh and warn him, Emily and I aren't going to be here. All right? I mean, she's going to come by first to say good-bye, and then I've got a whole special evening planned. So I'm sorry, no party.
Awwww!
No! All right?! I did not see the bird! I did not see the fish! I did not see the piece of Styrofoam that was shaped like Mike Tyson! I did not, because I was trying to teach you how to sail a boat! Which obviously is an impossible thing to do!
Joey, come on! We just went over this!
Oh, y'know, when we did that was when that bird was flying overhead with the fish in his mouth. Did you see it? It was gross!
All right that's it! You're yelling and I don't see you taking your top off! I quit!
What do you mean you quit?! You can't quit!
I mean I think I'd say no to anybody right now. Oh, but it was so strange. I mean I'm standing there with this charming, cute guy, who's asking me to go out with him, which I'm allowed to do, and I felt guilty. Y'know, like I'd be cheating on Ross or something.
Well, I told him I would think about it, but I'm gonna tell him no.
Huh.
Wow. So, okay, maybe that means that, you're not over Ross yet and you have issues with your father.
I don't have any issues with my Father.
All right. Woo! Hey, look at that, the airport's moving. Hey, are we moving?! Are we moving? Why are we moving? They said they were gonna wait! Miss? Yeah, does the captain know that we're moving? Oh my... Ross, you better be under the wheels of this thing!!
And uh, he will have a white wine spritzer.
Okay, good. Thank you. I'll be back shortly, all right?
Hey!
Hey!
Well, yeah, right, y'know what? Yeah, you're right, I mean, we no, we have our fun. Yeah! But if ......I mean, I mean like craaaazy! Y'know? Okay, all right. This is gonna, this is gonna sound y'know, a little umm, hasty, but uh, just go with it. Umm. Ugh. What if we got married?
Yeah-yeah, y'know if-if there was just like one little area where I-that I think we need-we would need to work on; I-I would think it was we're just not crazy enough!
I-I gotta say, I-I-I-I'm not too sure I agree with that.
What?!
Oh, I know, I know, it's-it's so, it's so totally like, "Whoa! Can we do this?" Y'know, I mean, but I mean it just feels right! Don't you think? It does! I mean, it just feels right, don't you think?
Noooo... the interview! She loved me! She absolutely loved me. We talked for like two and a half hours, we have the same taste in clothes, andoh, I went to camp with her cousin... And, oh, the job is perfect. I can do this. I can do this well!
Guys! Guess what, guess what, guess what, guess what!
Um, ok... the... the fifth dentist caved and now they're all recommending Trident?
That's great! That's wonderful!
Oh God, oh, and then she told the funniest story...
Okay, okay, I checked. We have: Earl Grey, English Breakfast, Cinnamon Stick, Camomile, Mint Medley, Blackberry, and.. oh, wait, there's one more, um.. Lemon Soother. You're not the guy that asked for the tea, are you? Okay.
Yes!
That, you get? That, you get?
Mail call, Rachel Green, bunk seven.
Thank you. Oh, cool! Free sample of coffee!
No, she was already in, but then this big bitch behind me tried to steal my umbrella, so I clocked her. Ohhh! I can't believe this, all I wanted was a few hours outside of work to see Joshua, so he can go ahead and start falling in love with me.
No, there is no Rachel Greep, but then this other girl overheard us and she was all, "I'm Rachel Greep! I'm Rachel Greep!" and he let her right in.
So you hit her in the face?
Aww, Pheebs.
Honey, that's you're name.
OK, you're whiney, you are, you're obsessive, you are insecure, you're, you're gutless, you know, you don't ever, you don't just sort of seize the day, you know. You like me for what, a year, you didn't do anything about it. And, uh, oh, you wear too much of that gel in your hair.
Wha... forget it Ross, no, I am not gonna stand here and make a list of. . .
C'mon Rachel.
See there, you uhh, alright, ya, you did what I said.
Yeah, and you know what? You're right, I do feel better, thank you Ross.
I'm off my break now so uh, um here you take this and um, I am gonna go pour these very nice people some coffee. Ok. Oh look at that, I don't have a pot. I don't have a pot. Well, hey, maybe I've got one at home, or in Scarsdale. Hey is that a door?
Wow. Wow, that's great. Great. Ok, wow, you know what.
Huh?
Hey.
Hey Phoebs, what's happening?
Okay, I think we can get the evaluation back before they see it, but we're gonna have to get into Mr. Zelner's office. Now, he doesn't get in until 10, so he's no problem, but his assistant, Betty, she comes in early to eat her breakfast at her desk.
Great! Great! You're making the bike very happy.
Okay Ross! Please don't die!
That's kinda sad.
Yeah, well Betty's kinda sad. Which is why I believe I can lure her away with these chocolates. Now, while I distract her, you get in the office.
All right listen ball boys! My grandmother had one of these when I was a little girl and it was the sweetest thing! I mean it was so cute, it would sit in my lap and purr all day long, and I would drag a shoestring on the ground and he would chase it!
ON A CAT??!!!!
It's not a cat!
Free cats do that too, y'know. {Which reminds me, if I might get a little political here, support your local animal shelter. Pet shops are not the place to buy dogs and cats from, you get a much better deal from the shelter, plus they probably won't die on you in a week and a half. If you want a leash, go to the pet shop. If you want the dog for that leash, go to the shelter and save it's life. Now back to regularly scheduled programming.}
It's not a cat!
Okay, I'm not just waitressing. I'm.. I, um... I write the specials on the specials board, and, uh... and I, uh... I take the uh dead flowers out of the vase... Oh, and, um, sometimes Artelle lets me put the little chocolate blobbies on the cookies.
I'm not! This is what I'm doing now. I've got this job-
Waitressing?
Well. Your mom didn't tell us about the blobbies.
Hey, Rach. How was it with your friends? Okay! How would you like some Tiki Death Punch?
The beef? Yeah, that was weird to me, too. But then, y'know, I thought "well, there's mincemeat pie," I mean that's an English dessert, these people just put very strange things in their food, y'know. Oh! by the way, can I borrow some Rum from your place?
It's a truffle. It's got all of these layers. First there's a layer of ladyfingers, then a layer of jam, then custard, which I made from scratch, then raspberries, more ladyfingers, then beef sauteed with peas and onions, then a little more custard, and then bananas, and then I just put some whipped cream on top!
W-What was the one right before bananas?
Y-sure!
And while I'm gone don't you boys sneak a taste.
No. I can't, you're a totally different person to me now. I used to think of you as somebody that would never, ever hurt me, ever. God, and now I just can't stop picturing with her, I can't, it doesn't matter what you say, or what you do, Ross. It's just changed, everything. Forever.
Yeah, what the hell did I know!
Look, look, there's got to be a way we can work past this. Okay, I can't imagine, I can't imagine my life without you. Without, without these arms, and your face, and this heart. Your good heart Rach, and, and....
Yeah, but this can't be it, I mean.
Then how come it is?
Well then uh, we better make this night count. Oh wait, I forgot to turn off the cappucino machine. Anchors away. Oh no no, my purse, my purse, my purse, my purse, my purse, my pu rse. Oh, you know what. I forgot to turn off the bathroom light.
I'll say.
I'm shipping out tomorrow.
Alright you know, why don't I just meet you upstairs.
Hey Joey, how'd the audition go?
No, no, no, I'm looking at a purchase order right here and it clearly states that we ordered the Rivera bikini in a variety of sizes and colours. And.... What does it matter, what I'm wearing?! Can I please speak to your supervisor? Thank you. We're holding.
Yeah, I guess, but what's like heads and what's tails?
Well it you don't know that, then I don't want to do this with you.
Hi!
Oh!! My God, what are you doing here?
Ross look, look this is good for you. Okay? Let's face it, so far the guy's not lovin' ya! But I can turn that around! I got the inside track! We can all go out to dinner, y'know? And I can talk you up! Ross, the guy is a very, very successful lawyer!
What? Why?!
This is weird for me!
How is that important?
Oh it's important!
Yeah, I admit it. I have a crush on you, and uh, and, and I know that's crazy because we work together, and-and nothing could ever happen, and the last thing I want to do is-is to freak you out or make you feel uncomfortable. Which is why it would be really great if you said something right about now.
No? All right, here's the truth um, Joey said what he said, because um, I'm attracted to you.
Wow.
Oh my god! Those guys are stealing my car!
What?
Look, I am so...so happy for you guys, but you getting married just reminds me of the fact that I'm not. I'm not even close. And I don't know, maybe I just wanted to make myself feel better. And I know that that's dumb, but oh my God you were so depressed when Ross got married that you slept with Chandler!
Because! Because I was sad.
What do you mean?
I don't care, she slept with me.
Anyway sweetie, I am, I'm so sorry I ruined your night.
Joey, you can't let him get away with that. Ya know what, I'm not going to let him get away with that. I'm going to say something to him-No, I really shouldn't say anything-No, I should say something to him. Gunther, I want you to give Joey his job back. That is really not fair that you have to fire him...
He left work in the middle of the day to do a personal errand and left you in charge when you've been working here two days? That's not, that's not right.
Yeah, what are ya gonna do?
Okay.
What?
Yeah, well, y'know umm... No honey, listen I think it's a great idea to become friends with someone before you date them, but I think the way you do it is y'know you meet someone, become their friend, build a foundation, then you ask them out on a date. Don't hit on your existing friends!
Y'know honey, umm, as uh, as flattered as I am that uh, you saw me first, uhh, I just, I-I don't think we should be cranking anything up.
I'll treat you real nice.
Won't-won't that take longer?
Yeah. Yeah. Oh, but once you find it, ohh it's so worth the wait.
Well, well, well, hop back in bucko, cause I got four sixes! I won! I actually won! Oh my God! Y'know what? I think I'm gonna make a little Ross pile. I think that one was Ross's, and I thinkohthat one was Ross's. Yes! : Well, I have got your money, and you'll never see it...
Me too. Alright, whattaya got.
Well, you better hop outta the shower, cause... I gotta flush.
And your fly's still open...
Ha, I made you look....
But honey he calls everybody by a nickname! Okay, look, I know, all right, just one dinner, please, just one night for me, please. I just want him to love you like I do. All right, well not exactly like I do, but, but, if you do come to dinner, I'll love you like I do in that black thing that you like.
Ross, my father doesn't hate you.
Please, he refers to me as 'wethead'.
I'll go.
Fine.
Well of those things that you said in the interview, I mean if you believe any of them, I must not be a very good assistant. Y'know what? I am just gonna pack up my desk, and I will be gone by the end of the day! Well, I guess there's no use to me sticking around 'til the end of the day!
Do you want me to quit?
What?! What would make you think that?
Wait-wait-wait-wait! You can put your sad little muffin back in it's drawer. If you must know the truth, I didn't want to lose a perfectly good assistant.
What?
Hi! So I'm out having lunch at Monica's and this guy starts talking to me, and it turns out he works for a buyer at Bloomingdale's and there happens to be an opening in his department. So I gave him my phone number and he's gonna call me this weekend to see if he can get me an interview!
The most unbelievable thing happened to me today.
Hi!
Wow!
I know!
So what do you say we make a pact? If you and I are both single by the time we're 40, we get married. I mean, we know each other, we like each other, and we've-we've already slept together so y'know there'll be no surprises there! You know what I mean? No like, "What's that?!"
Yeah, love. It's a tricky business isn't it?
I guess so.
Right. Ohh! You-you want me to be your backup.
Exactly.
Ugh, it was horrible! And-and the interview part went so well, y'know? I even made him laugh. He said something about a boat and I was like, "Well, yeah! If you've got enough life jackets!" Trust me, it was actually, it was very funny. Anyway, so we were saying good-bye and ugh!
No!
So what happened?
What happened?
All right, we were shaking hands and he kinda leaned toward me... Y'know maybe he was going to open the door, but I totally miss read him and I uhhh...
Well, like anything can be sexy. Like umm, oh-oh, like this dishtowel! Ooh, ooh, this feels sooo good against my cheek! And-and if I feel a little hot, I can just dab myself with it. Or I can bring it down to my side and bring it through my fingers while I talk to him.
Okay, oh, here's what you do. Just act like everything around you turns you on.
What do you mean?
I can do that!
Yeah? Okay! Good, good, because he's coming. He's coming. Hey, what's up?
Ross, hi, it's Rachel. I'm just calling to say that um, everything's fine and I'm really happy for you and your cat who, by the way, I think you should name Michael. And, you know, ya see there I'm thinking of names so obviously, I am over you. I am over you and that, my friend, is what they call closure.
Thank you. OK. Machine. Just waiting for the beep.
Good.
No, no, no, no, no, no No. Monica, it's Sunday morning. I'm not running on a Sunday.
Why not?
No Phoebe! You cannot get the phone that way; that's not fair! Okay look, I have an idea. Why don't we, why don't we see what kind of number he has on his speed dial, and then from that we can tell who has more in common with him. And then whoever does gets the phone.
And if it were true, how dare you come to me ask me for tips about a character that I've been playing for 20 years-I'll give you a tip!
Ms. Monroe... Oh there you go.
Or, we can decide by whose ever name is closer to the word phone.
I don't think so.
Ahh, yes, I will have a glass of the Merlot and uh, he will have a white wine spritzer. Woo! Hey, look at that, the airport's moving. Hey, are we moving?! Are we moving? Why are we moving? Hey, time-out, umm, yeah, does the captain know that we're moving? Oh my God. Oh, my gosh.
Emily.
Oh no-no-no! Oh-no! No! No! Emily!
You look cute in bubbles.
Ehh, you're just liquored up.
Don't say that I have no sentiment! This is a movie stub from our first date! This is an eggshell from the first time you made me breakfast in bed! This is from the museum from the first time we... were together. Okay, maybe I exchange gifts sometimes, but I keep the things that matter!
Absolutely!
That sounds like another word to me! Are you gonna take this seriously? Okay.
I don't know what to say, I'm sorry. Though, you're not supposed to take these. It's like a million years old, we, we actually, we had people looking for that.
Ooh, this always happens.
Anastassakis/Papasifakis wedding, excellent! {It's a good thing Jennifer Aniston is Greek, because she had to pronounce those names. Luckily for me, they were written on a sign.} Congratulations. Mazel Tov! Hi! Oh, great hat. Listen umm, I need you to perform another wedding. Can you do that?
Okay.
Okay.
I don't know. Are they Greek Orthodox?
Yeah! Yeah. They're...they're-they're my friends, uh, Monica Stephanopolus and uh, and Chandler Acidofolus.
You guys this cat is nothing like my grandmother's cat. I mean, it's not sweet, it's not cute, I even dragged that little string on the ground, and it just flipped out and scratched the hell out of me. And I swear, I know this sounds crazy, but every time this cat hisses at me I know it's saying, "Rachel!"
Oh, don't worry, it's not a cat.
Yeah.
Doesn't sound as crazy as paying a thousand dollars for a cat.
What?! You paid a thousand dollars for a cat when you owe me 300!!
Oh yeah! Of course, I mean, she's gonna get over this, y'know? I mean, so you said my name! Y'know you just said it 'cause you saw me there, if you'd have seen a circus freak, you would've said, "I take thee circus freak." Y'know, it didn't mean anything, it's just a mistake. It didn't mean anything. Right?
Hi. Sorry, things aren't working out so well.
Oh no! It could be better, but it's gonna be okay, right?
No! No! Of course it didn't mean anything! I mean, uh well, I can understand why Emily would think it meant something, y'know, because-because it was you...
Right...
So, Spin The Bottle works like this I spin the bottle, it lands on Gunther, so I would have to kiss Gunther. (She crawls over to where Gunther is sitting and sees the look of anticipation on Gunther's face and decides not to kiss him.) All right. Who wants to go first?
No! You guys can't leave yet! You have to stay, we-we got the whole big thing planned!
What big thing?
I'll go.
Yay!
Oh, like I wasn't dreading tomorrow enough, having to give it back to him... 'Hi Barry! Remember me? I'm the girl in the veil who stomped on your heart in front of your entire family!' Oh God and now I'm gonna have to return the ring, without the ring, which makes it so much harder...
Oh God, oh God, oh God oh God oh God oh God....
No, look, don't touch that!
Easy Rach, we'll find it. Won't we!
Oh! Yeah!
Monica, I'm quitting! I just helped an 81 year old woman put on a thong and she didn't even buy it! I'm telling you I'm quitting! That's it! I'm talking to my boss right now! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Okay bye, call me when you get this message.
Aaaahhhhhhh.
I'm outa here.
Well, what happened?
Well, he came in for a massage and everything was fine until...
Well, it gets worse. When asked if you take initiative I wrote, "Yes, he was able to unhook my bra with minimal supervision," and under Problems with Performance I wrote, "Dear God, I hope not," and then uh, then I drew a little smiley face, and then a small pornographic sketch.
Umm, I said I thought you were a good kisser, and uh, and that I like your tiney-tiny touchie.
No, not my touchie.
Ross! That is so sweet of you to get Phoebe that bike! When I heard the story, I almost cried.
Almost cried huh? Hear that Chandler? Almost cried!
...the way you owned up to everything, it just showed me how much you've grown. Y'know? I mean my Mom never thought this would work out. It was all, "Once a cheater, always a cheater." Ooh, I just wish we hadn't lost those four months, but if time was what you needed just to gain a little perspective...
Nobody likes change.
What? Okay, okay, okay, okay.
WE WERE ON A BREAK!!!!!!!
You seem to really like her.
I mean what if this keeps happening? Y'know, they'll-they'll be outside smoking, making all the decisions and I'll just be up in my office breathing my stupid clean air, y'know? And then when the day comes when Kim wants to promote one of us, who do you think she's gonna pick? Me or Smokey Smokerson?
I know! It's like I'm being punished for not having this disgusting, poisoning habit!
Yeah, it is the best.
Rachel, you can go down there, you don't have to smoke. Just say you wanna get some fresh air.
Yeah, I can do that.
Ross? Look, whatever this relationship stuff that Emily wants, just give it to her. Come on, the bottom line here is that you love her. So just fix whatever she wants fixed. Just do it. I mean, you're gonna have to try. You'll just gonna hate yourself if you don't. Oh come on answer it! It's driving me crazy!
Well, I-I know you can do that too. I'm just, I'm just saying if you need somebody to talk to... Hi!
Thanks.
Hello. Hi sweetie. Good. Look umm, yes I've been thinking about that thing that you wanted me to do and, I can do it. So will you come to New York?
Never done that before.
Ah, I-I never should have said what I said. It-y'know what? It just doesn't matter how I feel. I mean we work together, so nothing could really ever happen between us, and what I would love is just to go to work on Monday, and-and never talk about this again, okay? Big day Monday lots to do. So, we're okay?
Look, um, I think we should talk about what happened on the terrace.
Okay.
Um, I'm not.
Oh, god, I know it, that I freaked you out.
Well, you know what? This is great. Finally, I have someone I can pass on my wisdom too. Let me tell you about a couple of things I learned while working at the coffeehouse. First of all, the customer is always right. A smile goes a long way. And if anyone is ever rude to you? Sneeze muffin.
See, now it's weird again.
I Think It's Great That You Work Here. You'Re Going To Make A Lot Of Money, And Here's Your First Tip. Don't eat yellow snow. . Ah ha ha, 2:15, coffeehouse.
Thanks, Rach. Look, you guys are just terrific. Y'know? Now, how about clearing out of here so I can get some new customers. It's all about turnover.
Joey, seriously, can I get my coffee?
No, so I don't have to get married until I'm 33! That's three years, that's three whole years-Oh, wait a minute though. I'll need a year and a half to plan the wedding, and I'd like to know the guy for a year, year and a half before we get engaged... Which means I need to meet the guy by the time I'm thirty.
So, if I wanna have my kid when I'm 35, I don't have to get pregnant until I'm 34. Which gives Prada four years to start making maternity clothes! Oh wait, but I do want to be married for a year before I get pregnant...
Really! That long?! Look all you want, it's happening!
Which is fine! Because you just turned--twenty-eight!
No! Ross, no! It is not fine! Eh-eh-according to my plan I should already be with the guy I wanna marry!
Hello? Mindy! Hi! Hey, how are you? Yes, yes, I've heard, congratulations, that is so great. Really? Oh. Okay. Okay, well I'm working tomorrow, but if you want you can, you can, you can come by and... Okay... Great... Great... All right, so I'll, so I'll see you tomorrow! Okay.. Okay... Bye. Oh God. Oh God. Oh God.
I just have to go, all right? Do I need a reason? Huh? I mean I have things to do with my life, I have a jam packed schedule, and I am late- for keeping up with it. Okay?
Hello? Hello?
So how's Mindy?
Oh, she wants to see me tomorrow...Oh, she sounded really weird, I gotta call Barry... Hi, it's me, I just.. Mindy!! Mindy! Hi! No, I figured that's where you'd be!
Come on! They rushed into this thing so fast it's ridiculous! I mean, they're gonna be engaged for like what? A year? And somewhere along the way, one of them is gonna realise what they've done and they're call the whole thing off. I'm telling ya, you're gonna be dancing at my wedding before you're dancing at there's.
Handling it? What do you mean, handling it? There's nothing to handle. Now, maybe I would have a problem with this if it wasn't for me and Joshua. Y'know, they're not gonna get married anyway!
What?
Yeah, well, I don't dance at weddings.
Why not?
Oh my God this is sooo humiliating. I think the only thing that tops that was, was, was when I was in the eight grade and I had to sing the Copa Cabana in front of the entire school. I think I got about two lines into it before I ran and freaked out. Oh my God, my entire life is flashing before my eyes.
Why the hell didn't you tell me!
I'm sorry. What was I supposed to do stand up and shout 'Hey, Rachel, your butt is showing!'
Rach, hey look, I remember that, it wasn't so bad.
Oh Ross, would you stop, you got me, I'm dating you.
Because , because, I just heard it. I heard it, and it's ridiculous! I mean, you're married. You're-you're married and it's just ridiculous, and it's like, it's like when said it, I sort of like, I floated up out of my body, y'know? And, and-and then I heard myself say it and then the floating Rachel was like, "You are such an idiot!"
I'm so dead serious. I'm totally serious.
Why are you laughing?
Well, well I am married. Even though I haven't spoken to my wife since the wedding.
I'm sorry, that's not funny.
Yeah, he dumped me. He said, "Rachel, I can't do this. Even though you are a very, very, very beautiful woman. I can't do this. I'm married and I'm sorry." And then I don't know why but he said, "and you will never get promoted. Especially not above Kim, who is an integral cog in the Ralph Lauren machine."
Okay..Okay.. Look. I'm sorry that I lied to you before. You were right. Ralph and I were an item but were not anymore.
Oh, really?
You expect me to believe.. Hi Ralph.
Hi Kim.
Obviously you know how to haggle, so I'm not gonna try and take you on. Okay? So $800 and I don't call the cops because you're robbing me blind! Blind! Just take cat, leave the money, and run away! Run away! Damnit! Cat, can't you at least smile or something?! Okay, did anybody just hear that? Anybody?
Well, I do, but you're just gonna have to actually look at this as more of an investment than a cat.
Okay, yeah, I just wanted a cat.
I'm starving!
Come on guys! Suck it up! We're closing in on ten hours! It's gut-check time!
Mon you definitely have to make it a theme wedding, and the theme could be, "Look how much money we've got!" Y'know, I mean you could put, you could put money in-in the invitations! You-you could have like little money place settings. And ah, you could start with a money salad! I mean it'll be dry, but people will like it.
Hello.
And that's Pete's Mom.
Would you stop? We've only been going out a couple of weeks, I mean we don't even know if he's gonna propose.
Yes, but this is Pete. Okay? He's not like other people, on your first date he took you to Rome. For most guys that's like a third or fourth date kinda thing.
Um, ok, uh, oh god, um, when you and uh Ross first started going out, it was really hard for me, um, for many reasons, which I'm not gonna bore you with now, but um, I just, I see how happy he is, you know, and how good you guys are together, and um, Monica's always saying how nice you are, and god I hate it when she's right.
Well, you're not totally paranoid.
Oy.
Thanks. Hey, listen, would you like to go to a movie sometime or something?
Yeah, that'd be great. I'd love it.
They wanna know if I'm okay. Okay.. they wanna know if I'm okay, okay, let's see. Well, let's see, the FICA guys took all my money, everyone I know is either getting married, or getting promoted, or getting pregnant, and I'm getting coffee! And it's not even for me! So if that sounds like I'm okay, okay, then you can tell them I'm okay, okay?
But I haven't used my card in weeks!
That is the unusual activity. Look, they just wanna see if you're okay.
Uh- Rachel has left the building, can you call back?
Alright, c'mon! Let's play Twister!
It's a truffle. It's got all of these layers. First there's a layer of ladyfingers, then a layer of jam, then custard, which I made from scratch, then raspberries, more ladyfingers, then beef sauteed with peas and onions, then a little more custard, and then bananas, and then I just put some whipped cream on top!
Look at it, isn't it beautiful?
Yeah, yeah, what is it?
W-What was the one right before bananas?
The beef? Yeah, that was weird to me, too. But then, y'know, I thought "well, there's mincemeat pie," I mean that's an English dessert, these people just put very strange things in their food, y'know. Oh! by the way, can I borrow some Rum from your place?
No! Put that box down! We are not going anywhere! This is my apartment and I like it! This is a girl's apartment! That is a boy's apartment, it's dirty and it smells. This is pretty. It's-it's so pretty! And look, and it's-it's purple! And I'm telling you, you with the steady hand, I am not moving, and now I have got the steady hand.
Yeah, all right. Meanwhile, I'm gonna do whatever I can to help this so, I'm just gonna y'know, lie it your chair, Y'know? Yeah, good, I'm let gravity y'know, do its jobs.
Hey, Rach, can you give me a hand with this box?
I'll take care of it.
That's right! You do what the hand says!
Um, excuse me, everyone. Ah, this is my last night working here, and I ah, just wanted say that I made some really good friends working here, and ah, it's just time to move on. Ah, and no offence to everybody who ah, still works here, you have no idea how good it feels to say that as of this moment I will never have to make coffee again.
Should I tell her I ordered tea?
No.
Now Mr. Kaplan Sr. likes his coffee strong, so your gonna use two bags instead of one, see. Now pay attention, 'cause this part's tricky, see some people use filters just once.
I'm, I'm sorry you didn't get to go to Spacecamp, and I'm hoping that maybe somehow, this may make up for it. Presenting Sarah Tuttle's Private Very Special Spacecamp!!
Okay, fine. Gunther, y'know what, I am a terrible waitress, do you know why I'm a terrible waitress? Because, I don't care. I don't care. I don't care which pot is regular and which pot is decaf, I don't care where the tray spot is, I just don't care, this is not what I want to do. So I don't think I should do it anymore. I'm gonna give you my weeks notice.
Can't I just look at the handles on them?
You would think.
What?!
Gunther, I quit.
Hi, Mr. Treeger. Hi, it's Rachel Green from upstairs. Yes, somebody, uh, broke our knob on the radiator and it's really hot in here. Yes, it's, it's hot enough to bake cookies. Well, do you think we could have a new one by 6? Wha t, no, no, Tuesday, we can't wait until Tuesday, we're having a party tonight.
Oh, oh that's right, I forgot about your ability to fuse metal.
Hey, it's Funny's cousin, Not Funny.
OK, tip the man.
No, if he doesn't like our cookies, too bad, I am not gonna be blackmailed. Look if worse comes to worse, it gets a little warm, we'll call it a theme party.
Thank you. Thank you very much. Umm, I've known them separately and I've known them together and-and to know them as a couple is to know that you are truly in the presence of love. So I would like to raise my glass to Monica and Chandler and the beautiful adventure they are about to embark upon together. I can think of no two people better prepared for the journey.
Okay! Okay! Umm, Webster's Dictionary defines marriage as... Okay!! Forget that! That sucks!! Okay, never mind! Forget it! Umm, umm, okay, uh... I met, I-I met, I met Monica when we were just a couple of six year olds and I became friends with Chandler when he was 25, although he seemed like a six year old.
Oh! That's nice.
Wow. Good speech.
Yeah, it really was!
I don't care about the little dude! I can't! I cannot listen to anymore of this! Y'know, the only person who would want to listen to this is a mental health professional! And then it's only because they get paid $100 an hour! Do you know how much money I could've made listening to you? $2,000! And do you know when I figured that out? While you were talking!
Okay, hold on real quick, hold on a second let me just uh, get a little more comfortable here. Wait, now wait a second, this isn't too revealing is it?
No. What ever happened to that little dude. So full of dreams...
What?! I can't believe you're trying to stifle me! When just 14 hours ago we figured out that that is exactly what my mother was trying to do to me!
Oh... I'm sorry. I... I-I don't mean-I didn't mean to stifle you. I... This is all just a little overwhelming.
Yeah, I mean, you know it, I mean, if it were me I, I, you know, I'd want you to, I don't know, like catch me off guard, you know, with like a really good kiss, you know really, sort of um, soft at first, then maybe um brush the hair away from my face, and look far into my eyes in a way that let's me know that something amazing is about to happen.
Maybe it, maybe it doesn't have to be this tough. I mean, maybe you were on the right track with this whole, you know, spontaneous thing. I mean, women really like that.
Really?
Uh-huh.
And then, I don't know, I mean you'd pull me really close to you so that, so that I'd be pressed up, you know, right against you. And, um, it would get kind of sweaty and uh, and blurry, and then it's just happening.
Okay! Okay! Umm, Webster's Dictionary defines marriage as... Okay!! Forget that! That sucks!! Okay, never mind! Forget it! Umm, umm, okay, uh... I met, I-I met, I met Monica when we were just a couple of six year olds and I became friends with Chandler when he was 25, although he seemed like a six year old.
Ohh, wait a minute, we haven't pre...
Go!
Oh! That's nice.
Thank you. Thank you very much. Umm, I've known them separately and I've known them together and-and to know them as a couple is to know that you are truly in the presence of love. So I would like to raise my glass to Monica and Chandler and the beautiful adventure they are about to embark upon together. I can think of no two people better prepared for the journey.
Okay look, let me paint you a little picture. All right, you are settin' sail up the Hudson! You've got the wind in your h--arms! You-you get all that peace and quiet that you've always wanted! You get back to nature! You can go fishin'! You can-ooh, you can get one of those little hats and have people call you captain, and then when you're old, Cappy.
Oooooh...
I don't think so dear.
What the hell, it's for a good cause! All right!
No way! It's mine!!
Yeah. It's just gonna be too hard. Y'know? I mean, it's Ross. How can I watch him get married? Y'know it's just, it's for the best, y'know it is, it's... Y'know, plus, somebody's got to stay here with Phoebe! Y'know she's gonna be pretty big by then, and she needs someone to help her tie her shoes; drive her to the hospital in case she goes into labour.
See, he's her lobster.
Nooooo. You're really not going?
You don't have a car. And your license expired.
I know. Yeah, see, there's so much to do and I have so little time to do it in.
Hey, y'know, at least you have somebody to miss that stuff with! I hate being alone this time of year! Next thing you know it'll be Valentine's Day, then my birthday, then bang!-before you know it, they're lighting that damn tree again. Ohh, I want somebody! Y'know, I want a man!! I mean, it doesn't even have to be a big relationship, y'know, just like a fling would be great.
Umm, that paper's two weeks old.
All right, who keeps leaving old newspapers in the trash?! I really wanted to take Kathy to this, I can't believe I missed it.
Really?! I didn't think girls ever just wanted a fling.
Well, believe me, it's been a long time since I've been flung.
Monica, I'm quitting! I just helped an 81 year old woman put on a thong and she didn't even buy it! I'm telling you I'm quitting! That's it! I'm talking to my boss right now! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Okay bye, call me when you get this message. Oh! Mr. Waltham, I ah really need to talk to you.
All right Pheebs, stick out your plate!
Oh.
In a moment, please, I'm in the middle of a task. And you have a customer.
Hi!
Alright. In high school I was the prom queen and I was the homecoming queen and the class president and you... were also there! But if you take this monkey, I will lose one of the most important people in my life. You can hate me if you want, but please do not punish him. C'mon, Luisa, you have a chance to be the bigger person here! Take it!
Sorry, prom queen.
You had to be a bitch in high school, you couldn't've been fat.
Nope.
Alright. Well then how about I call your supervisor, and I tell her that you shot my friend in the ass with a dart?
My parents happened. All they had to do was sit in the same stadium, smile proudly, and not talk about the divorce. But nooo, they got into a huge fight in the middle of the commencement address. Bishop Tutu actually had to stop and shush them. But you know what, you know what the good news is? I get to serve coffee for the next 8 hours.
Ya know, I mean this is supposed to be a joyous occasion. My sister's graduating from college, nobody thought she would. It's a true testament to what a girl from long island would do for a Celica.
So what happened?
Ok, so I guess we don't invite her parents.
Well, how bout just her mom?
What?! I didn't have a good time in Greece! Ross abandoned me! Okay, I couldn't get a plane out, so I had to stay in their honeymoon suite with people coming up to me all the time going, "Oh, Mrs. Geller, why are you crying?" I mean, it was sooo humiliating. I felt like such an idiot! I mean, it's all my fault! And you know why, because I make very bad decisions.
Oh, Ross, when you make out card; be sure to make it out to, EM-I-LY.
Rach, that's great! It's so good that you had a good time in Greece!
Oh that's not true.
Yes it is! It is true! I went, I went after Ross in stupid London.
Here is a book of poetry that I know Monica loves. And-and ohh God this is funny, look, this is a picture of one Halloween where she dressed up as a bride. And look, she made me carry her train, which was weird because I was Wonder Woman. Oh and here's a little purse that I found. Y'know I just thought that maybe they could hold the rings in there.
Yeah! Oh, umm when-when Monica and Chandler got engaged I started putting some stuff together, y'know just in case...
Oh that's so sweet thanks.
Ohh.
And umm, vintage handkerchiefs y'know 'cause, people cry at weddings. I'm just gonna grab a couple of these.
Wh-whoa! All right, okay-okay, I see, I see what's going on here! Now listen, look-look, I'm sorry if I gave you the wrong impression, but I am not some hussy who will just sleep around to get ahead! Now even though I , hey-hey-hey, even though I kissed you, that does not give you the right to demand sex from me. I do not want, this job that bad. Good day, sir.
Excuse me?
Here let me...
Ugh, you will not believe what that sleaze-ball from Ralph Lauren did too me!
Okay-okay that-that's amazing. How did you know that?
I am still talking!! And then you chase away the one guy that I actually liked! I mean, no offense to you guys. Really! I mean congratulations on all the cash, and-and y'know--Wow! You do have very soft hair! But I would much rather go to the ball all by myself than go through anymore of this! Good-bye! Now do you use some sort of special conditioner on that hair?!
I'll tell ya who should be embarrassed! It's you guys! Come on! This is ridiculous! Thank you very much, but I do not need you to get me a date!
Then why did she ask us to...
Yes, Papaya Extract.
Thank you!
Oh! Look what happened! {Don't get your hopes up guys, we only get to see her from the back or from the neck up. Its times like these I wish that the networks would broadcast some nudity other than Denis Franz's butt.} Huh, check me out! I'm in my kitchen...naked! I'm picking up an orange. I'm naked! Lighting the candles, naked, and carefully.
Great!
Okay, London 1...
Oh my God! That's Rachel naked! I can't look at that! I am looking at this. Okay, vivid colors, expressive brush strokes-Unless she wants me to be looking at that. She knows I'm home. She knows I can see her. What kind of game is she playing? I think maybe someone's lonely tonight. Oh-ho, Dr. Geller! Stop it! You're being silly! Or, am I?
Love to love ya baby! Ow! Love to love ya baby! Ow! Love to love ya, baby! Darnit! Ugh.
All right, it's okay. One little setback is okay, just don't let it happen again, all right? Now since daddy paid for all this stuff, I should take it all away. But I'm just gonna take the-the pajmena. And the uh, and the uh pants. Y'know what, I'm just gonna take it all away, 'cause that way you'll just really learn the lesson. Okay? All righty, I'm gonna run a couple of errands and I will see you at dinner.
Oh, come on! You think that's gonna work on me?! I invented that!
Right! But, I am sorry.
She took all my stuff.
Yeah. Everything but, the little blue one.
Jill, honey, I think this is the best thing that could've ever happened to you. I mean you needed to get out on your own anyway! And you know when I did it, I-I-I at first I was scared, and look at me now! I'm the only daughter dad is proud of! Okay, well this is, this is what you're gonna do. You're gonna get a job, you're gonna get an apartment, and then I'll help you and you can stay with us. Right Pheebs, she can stay with us?
Yeah but it wasn't for me, it was for a friend.
Boy did we make friends with the wrong sister!
Of course, yeah!
Oh, that's so great! Okay, I'm really gonna do this! I don't know how to thank you guys.
And uh, yeah, I didn't really, I didn't want to say anything, but it kinda it just, it kinda kept coming back to me, and umm, remember we were in the casino and for some reason thought it would be funny to eat a lot of grapes. And uh, and I thought it would be funnier if we got married. So as a, as a compromise we decided first to get married, and then to eat a lot of grapes. So umm, sorry I got us into this mess.
Well, remember how we were too drunk to remember anything the night we were married?
Yeah?
So then if-if-I mean if you think about it, this is all your fault.
Yeah, don't push it though.
C'mon Daddy, listen to me! It's like, it's like, all of my life, everyone has always told me, 'You're a shoe! You're a shoe, you're a shoe, you're a shoe!'. And today I just stopped and I said, 'What if I don't wanna be a shoe? What if I wanna be a- a purse, y'know? Or a- or a hat! No, I'm not saying I want you to buy me a hat, I'm saying I am a ha- It's a metaphor, Daddy!
I say push her down the stairs.
Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs!
You can see where he'd have trouble.
Look Daddy, it's my life. Well maybe I'll just stay here with Monica.
Hi, Mindy. Hi, it-it's Rachel. Yeah, I'm fine. I-I saw Barry today. Oh, yeah, yeah he-he told me. No, no, it's okay. I hope you two are very happy, I really do. Oh, oh, and Mind, y'know, if-if everything works out, and you guys end up getting married and having kids- and everything- I just hope they have his old hairline and your old nose. Okay, I know it was a cheap shot, but I feel so much better now.
You're gonna be an aunt.
Oh shut up!
Hi guys!
Hey, Pheebs! Hi!
What? This-this, no, oh no, no-no-no, this is not-that's-that's not what it is. See, see, okay, I work in fashion, see and-and, this is a real dress actually. It's-it's, they're-they're wearing it in Milan, so part of my job is too wear the clothes, and then I see how people respond, and then I report back to my superiors at Bloomingdale's, so... And obviously in uh, in-in this case, I am going to report back, "USA not ready."
Hello.
Hello. Well, Joshua, that $500 was for groceries.
Maybe in L.A?
Yes!
Barry, I'm sorry... I am so sorry... I know you probably think that this is all about what I said the other day about you making love with your socks on, but it isn't... it isn't, it's about me, and I ju- Hi, machine cut me off again... anyway...look, look, I know that some girl is going to be incredibly lucky to become Mrs. Barry Finkel, but it isn't me, it's not me. And not that I have any idea who me is right now, but you just have to give me a chance too...
Ooh, steer clear of you.
That's right.
I'm divorced! I'm only 26 and I'm divorced!
Shut up!
I'm funny? Oh thank God! Well hey, I've got a ton of these! Umm, oh hear-Do you want a good one? Here's a good one. Umm, you uh, you take a quarter, take a quarter and, and you blacken the edge. Right? And then you say to person, I bet you can't roll this quarter from your forehead to your chin without it leaving your face. And then when they do it, they're left with a big black pencil line right down the center of their face.
Yeah? You like that one?
Yeah, you're funny.
Can I do it to you?
Yeah, I-I-I-I'm funny Ben, but I'm not stupid. Okay?
Phoebe, I'm going to Ross's wedding because he is my ex-boyfriend and that would be really uncomfortable. Not because, I'm still in love with him! I mean, hey, y'know, I like Ross as much as the next guy, y'know? Clearly I have feelings for him, but feelings don't mean love! I mean, I still have loving feelings for Ross. Yeah! But, I have, I have continuing feelings of love, but that doesn't mean that-that I'm still in love with him. Y'know? I-I have sexual feelings for him, but I do love him-Ohh! Oh my God! Oh my-why didn't you tell me?!!
I'm not in love with Ross!
Oh. No. No. Good! Yeah, me neither.
We thought you knew!
We?!
Oh my God! I can not believe that! I mean I don't really like it when Ross goes out with anyone, but my sister isn't that like incest or something?! Oh my God, and they're gonna have sex! Oh! Oh no what if he marries her too?! Oh this is just terrible, this is just terrible. And I can't stop it! I can't-I don't own Ross! Y'know? And Jill, she should be able to do whatever it is that she wants to do! And oh my God, I can't believe Ross is marrying my little sister, this terrible. Oh my God, this is just the worst thing that could have ever happened to me.
Oh there is no way.
Okay then.
But great news about the apartment pants, huh?
That'll be $3.85.
Ya, know what Barr, I'm not gonna leave. I probably should, but I'm not, see 'cause I promised myself that I would make it through at least *one* of your weddings . See now, tonight, all I really wanted was to make it though this evening with a little bit of grace and dignity. Well , I guess we can all agree that's not gonna happen. There's nothing really left to say except.... "Her name was Lola. She was a showgirl. With yellow feathers , feathers in her hair, and a dress cut down to there. She would..."
No, Rach!
And once again she is out of here. Okay who had 9:45? Um?
Marenge,
"...marenge, thank you honey, and do the cha-cha. And while she like to be a star, Tony always tended bar. At the, wait, wait, everybody.."
You know what, I'm gonna do that, I'm gonna call him up, and I'm gonna ask him out. I can do that. Ask him out. How you doin'? Hi! Joshua? It's Rachel Green from Bloomingdale's. Yeah, umm, I was wondering if you umm, if you umm, left your wallet at the store today? Well, we found a wallet, and we- the license? Well, that is a good idea! Uh, well, let's see here this says this license belongs to a uh, uh, belongs to a mister uh, Pheebs, and umm, yeah, so sorry to bother you at home. I'll see you tomorrow. Bye. You've done that a thousand times?
Oh, please!
Hey, how you doin'?
I've never done that.
Ohh, God, I just got so nervous that he would say no.
No. Okay. I was at the airport, getting into a cab, when this woman- this blonde planet with a pocketbook- starts yelling at me. Something about how it was her cab first. And then the next thing I know she just starts- starts pulling me out by my hair! So I'm blowing my attack whistle thingy and three more cabs show up, and as I'm going to get into a cab she tackles me. And I hit my head on the kerb and cut my lip on my whistle...oh...everybody having fun at the party? Are people eating my dip?
Rome. Jerk missed his flight.
And then... your face is bloated?
Y'know, when I saw you at the store last week, it was probably the first time I ever mentally undressed an elf.
Wow, that's, uh, dirty.
It's just this thing. Every year we would go out on my dad's boat and watch the fireworks. Mom always hated it because the ocean air made her hair all big. My sister Jill would be throwing up over the side and my dad would be upset becasue nobody was helping and then when we did help he would scream at us for doing it wrong. But then when the fireworks started, everybody just shut up, you know, and it'd get really cold, and we would all just sort of smush under this one blanket. It never occured to anybody to bring another one. And now it's just...
Ya know, I just, so weird. I mean I was in there just listening to them bitch about each other and all I kept thinking about was the fourth of July.
Becasue it reminded you of the way our forefathers used to bitch at each other?
I, I know.
Ok, thanks for coming, I hope you guys had fun.
Now, now the one in the feather boa, that's Dr. Francis. Now, she used to be a man. Okay, now look, see, there's Raven. We hate her. We're glad she's dying. Okay- Wh- wh- Marcel, are you playing with Monica's shoes? You know you're not supposed to pl- whoah. Marcel, did you poo in the shoe? Marcel, bad monkey! Oh! Oh! Sorry, Barry. Little engagement gift. I'm sure you didn't register for that. Who died? Who died? Roll him over! Oh, c'mon, roll him over! Oh...! Well, we know it wasn't Dexter, right Marcel? Because- Marcel? Marc-
Anyway, I figured after work I'd go pick up a bottle of wine, go over there and, uh, try to woo her.
Hey, y'know what you should do? You should take her back to the 1890's, when that phrase was last used.
How could you lose him?
I don't know. We were watching TV, and then he pooped in Monica's shoe-
Mom, would you relax. That was 10 blocks from here and, the, the woman was walking alone at night, I would never do that. Mom, c'mon, stop worrying. This is a safe street, this is a safe building, there's nothing OH MY GOOOD, oh my God, oh I gotta go, I gotta go, I gotta go. OK, that's fine, you just read the paper, I'm gonna get a pot, it's not for you. OK, that's fine, read the Family Circus, enjoy the gentle comedy. Aaahh, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, aaaaahh. It's open you guys.
Oh, my major was totally useless. I mean, how often do you look in the classifieds and see "Philosopher wanted"?
Sure.
Hi.
Hi, hi can I help you?
Oh God... well, it started about a half hour before the wedding. I was in the room where we were keeping all the presents, and I was looking at this gravy boat. This really gorgeous Lamauge gravy boat. When all of a sudden- Sweet 'n' Lo?- I realized that I was more turned on by this gravy boat than by Barry! And then I got really freaked out, and that's when it hit me: how much Barry looks like Mr. Potato Head. Y'know, I mean, I always knew looked familiar, but... Anyway, I just had to get out of there, and I started wondering 'Why am I doing this, and who am I doing this for?'. So anyway I just didn't know where to go, and I know that you and I have kinda drifted apart, but you're the only person I knew who lived here in the city.
Hi.
So you wanna tell us now, or are we waiting for four wet bridesmaids?
Who wasn't invited to the wedding.
Ooh, I was kinda hoping that wouldn't be an issue...
Now you're probably going to hire one of the people who did not ah, who did, who did not umm, yell at you and storm out, and I think that's a big mistake and here's why. I made a huge fool of myself and I came back, that shows courage. When I thought you wanted sex in exchange for this job, I said no. That shows integrity. And, I was not afraid to stand up for myself and that shows courage. Okay umm, now I know I already said courage, but y'know you gotta have courage. And umm, and finally when I thought you were making sexual advances in the workplace, I said no and I was not litigious. {By the way, litigious means to want to litigate and litigate is to make a lawsuit against. So she didn't want to sue him. Don't worry, I had to look it up too.} So there you go, you got, you got courage, you got integrity, you got courage again, and not litigious. Look Mr...
Okay. Umm, well, first I would like to start by apologizing for kissing you and uh, for yelling at you.
Fair enough.
Zelner.
Zelner! Right! I knew that! I really, really want this job and I think, I think I would be really good at it.
