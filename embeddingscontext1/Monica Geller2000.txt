No it's umm, more like a wrap. Okay so uh, I'm gonna go guys.
Are you makin' him a sandwich?
I guess I set up the video camera to try and entice Joey.
Uhh, Monica?
There's still so much to do. Have you written your vows yet?
Do you realize you get louder each week?
You don't? Well, that's the difference between a professional and a layman.
You do?
Thank you. This is my friend Phoebe. She's gonna be helping me tonight.
Monica? My God you used to be so. . . I mean you, you, you, you must have lost like. . . You look great.
Hey Rach, remember that great song, Me, Myself, and I?
All right, fine.
Yes, a relationship. For your information I am crazy about this man.
Oh please, a relationship.
: then why were you watching them and giving YOURSELF a treat.
no they don't.
Ah, and I mean, he's going out with her? He can not persue this.
Oh my God.
Well, let's just say it's not the first time you've stolen my thunder.
No-no, seriously-seriously, what was the especially me part about?
Doesn't matter, I'll get 'em tomorrow. Or not. Whenever.
Really? Just casually strewn about in that reckless haphazard manner?
Okay, I will. Remember that thing that we just discussed that you wanted to do?
Well, then talk!
Umm, Chandler, if you want I can make you some macaroni and cheese for dinner.
Oh, well, I'm so glad you brought him here then.
I'm fine! I just, I'm thinking how much it's an end of era.
Are you okay? You're not blinking.
They love my candy? Oh man!!! I've gotta go make more!!
Yeah, and they've been coming by all day. They love it!
Oh, some idiot customer put a suggestion in the suggestion box.
So who's idea was it to put everybody in the diner on skates?
I can't believe my parents are actually pressuring me to find one of you people.
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Let her dangle.
Didn't it drive you crazy to have a switch and not know what it did?
Ohh, Nothing.
Oh! Did anybody see that-that documentary on the Korean War?
Well, we can talk about something else. What do you want to talk about? Vivisection? The Vasdeferens? The Vietnam War?
No! No. They're umm... They're just uh...ground beef smileys.
What you got over there? Tacos?
God, you are so lucky. I mean, I mean. . . you know what I mean.
My parents are dead.
Yeah, I asked you and Phoebe to pick up the pies. You did remember, right?
Dessert?
Hey, did you get the turkey bast-Oh my God! Oh my God! Who is that?
Well, of course it smells really bad. You have your head inside a turkey's ass!
Hey, did you get the turkey basted-Oh my God! Oh my God! Who is that?
Hey!
Well I'd probably be scared of a guy using a fake voice.
Okay, so we've established my name, and hit me. But theoretically y'know, I mean say we weren't friends, say it's a blind date. I show up at your door, and I'm like "Hey, nice to meet, ya. Hey, oh-hey."
How hammered are you? Huh? These, these are Joey's sisters.
Okay, how many of that girl are you seeing?
Toe the line. Thread the needle. Think outside the box!
What?
Come on! So she comes to the wedding! I mean it won't be so bad.
Lie!!! How hard is that?! The check's in the mail! Oh your baby is so cute! I can't wait to read your book Ross!!
Ugly Naked Guy's laying kitchen tile. Eww!
What?
Well, I mean what about friends of your grandmother's? Wouldn't they have the recipe?
That's what you think.
I know! I mean it's like me and your dad, that's a totally separate thing.
Y'know I-I thought it was gonna be weird, I mean I almost called and canceled, but it really isn't.
No, Chandler's still in Phase One, and Joey's that thing you smell.
Ohh, gosh. You guys, come on, this is-I have to meet Joshua! This is my one chance for him to see the fun Rachel. Y'know the "Wouldn't it be great if she was my wife" Rachel. Ohh, all right! Are Joey and Chandler back?
Honey, wait. We only did it once. It didn't mean anything to me.
Oh. Oh my God.
Hey! It's me. Mon-i-ca! Can I just tell you how proud I am of you.
Uh-oh.
She's the actress that was in Disclosure, Indecent Proposal, Ghost!
Oh my God! I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Which one's Demi Moore?
Just like you told her you did! ... Just pointing out the irony.
I turned it off. Mother of God, I turned it off!
So your first whole weekend without Ben, what're you guys gonna do?
Ok. He kept my dollar.
Oh, yes, umm, I'm here to pick up a dress that you have on hold.
May I help you ladies?
Hey, Rach, can I borrow your eyelash curler, I think I lost mine.
Yeah, I saw him waiting for an elevator.
Uh, huh. Or maybe to a galaxy far, far away.
Monica, do you want us to take you home?
Oh my God, she's not gonna like the chicken that night either is she?!
What do you think she's just gonna sit there quietly? You don't think she's gonna want to make a toast? You don't think she's gonna want to grab the microphone and sing Part-time Lover?!
Well, maybe the mailman liked the cookies, we just didn't give him enough.
Oh, by the way Mon, I don't think the mailman liked your cookies. Here are the ornaments your mom sent.
I think our lover's spat will start a little early this month.
But I got to act with a robot Pheebs, and-and I don't know anything about technology! I can't even use Chandler's computer except to find porn! And-and that's only 'cause it's right there when you turn it on!
I know, he's just so, so... Do you remember you and Tony DeMarco?
I can see that. You look like you slept with a hanger in your mouth.
We are going to Dick Clark's New Year's Rocking Eve!
It was a dry day.
Yep, we're gonna meet the lady who could be carrying our baby.
Oh, right! Your adoption interview!
No! Umm well, some people say that Oysters are an aphrodisiac.
They have parasites?
Oh it's umm, good! It's umm, it's good, just here watering the plants.
Hey Monica, how's it going.
Joey let me ask you a question. What does this light switch do?
OH...MY...GAWD!!
No-no, I-I really don't want to talk about it! I don't! Especially with you.
Honey, Monica, this is ridiculous! Look...
Dr. Miller? P E C F D.
Okay, just give me the damn drops!
Would you slap me? Would you slap me right here in the face?!
Certainly.
Joey, now that you're okay with the house, do you wanna go see your room?
That's not funny! You know I'm afraid of little girl ghosts!
Oh, I'm so glad you guys like it. Yay! All right I gotta go to work.
Oh yeah.
All right relax Mr. I've Had Sex Four Times!
With Roger? Not just with Roger?! Oh my God!
Hey, how did it go with Mike, is he gonna let you keep the painting?
Hi! Sorry, I'm late.
Do you umm, you really think the best reason to get married is because you're sorry?
I'm doing this because I'm sorry?
Hey Ross! So, I was checking out the uh, real estate section...
Sure, do whatever you want.
No I don't know Chandler! Not anymore! It's like it's like something's changed.
Well, you know Chandler.
Oh, we used to drive each other crazy playing the shadow game.
Ah!!
Why in the world would you take this tape and and why would you watch it?
Monica, look... I don't think you and I have any secrets anymore... Not ready to joke about it yet, okay, I see you later.
When I take a shower, she leaves me little notes on the mirror.
What else?
Ok, let me go check. Your mom want's to say goodbye.
I think I saw Rachel out in the hall.
Well, if we owe it? Oh my... When is Joey gonna be home?
Oh-aw my God! Now, I understand if you never want to sleep with me again, but that would be wrong. We're too good! We owe it, to sex!
All right! Come on Monica! Look alive! Come on, look alive!
Okay. Oh! Oh no.
Well, tonight, I actually went out with Chip Matthews in high school.
Um-hmm.
Dr. Burke? I don't think so. I mean, like, he's a grown up.
Oh, you are so much the smitten kitten. You should ask him out.
Rachel, you are packed though right, I mean please tell me that you're packed.
Well and clearly not a minute sooner.
Well what are you gonna do when he finds out he wasn't even asked?!
I don't even know the man. Okay? We're not the close. I haven't seen him in years.
No no, it's not working on me. Wow! I must be growing up!
Oh! What's the matter? Are you scared? You're afraid I'm a better singer? You're afraid I'm gonna beat you at singing?
Yeah, and we've paid for a room, that we're supposed to be in right now!
Wh.. what? No wait, you don't get to leave! I've got a massage client waiting outside my door any minute!
You guys! Do you realize that any minute now, Phoebe can be pregnant?
I know! Why don't you get drunk! That worked for a lot of girls in my high school.
Limited seating my ass. Let's see who made the cut. Hi!
Oh here, I think this is us. Yeah.
Not never. I mean, I'm gonna see him tomorrow at my eye appointment.
OK, so what, you're just never gonna see him again?
It was a mistake. Please don't take this to mean anything, because it doesn't.
Phoebe and Rachel! So the people that knew about our wedding before me were you, Phoebe and Rachel, Heldi, and apparently some band called Starlight Magic 7 who are available by the way!
Ok, which one of us do you think is gonna be the first one to get married?
All right look. Penis schmenis. We're all people.
Ping pong? Honey, they have ping pong! Let's play!
They have a game room downstairs! Ping pong and stuff.
No it's not! No! No! Now it's about you and Ross getting back together!
It is! It is!
I know, and she's always bragging about all the famous people she's met.
You know what Amanda said to me when she got me on the phone? "Oh, so sorry to catch you on your Mo-Bile!" If-if you don't wanna get me on my mo-Bile, don't call me on my mo-Bile!"
Oh, it was awful. I guess some people just don't appreciate really good food.
Hey, how was your chef thing?
Okay, please be careful with that. It was my grandmother's. Be careful.
Don't make jokes now.
Like I remember his office number! Speed dial 7.
Honey, you've got to go. What's his office number?
Hi. Uh, you... you don't know me, I'm Monica Geller... Ross's sister.
Hey, that coupon expires, you know.
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
I can do it, okay? Come on, let's go.
What these? Oh, these are, um, for.. cuts and scrapes.
I think you may have a drinking problem.
Ohh, I'm such an idiot. I can't believe I actually thought she could change.
This used to be your room? Wow! You must've been in really good shape as a kid.
Why don't you just stop doing stupid things? Then you wouldn't have to apologize.
As bad as that went I actually enjoyed myself. I think that I'm going to apologize for all of the stupid things I do.
Oh, you really want to talk about getting people to like you huh, funny man?
Is that why you became a chef? So that people would like you?
What are you talking about? If you get married in Vegas you're married everywhere.
Yeah, if you get married in Vegas, you're only married in Vegas.
God, this is so hard. I can't decide between lamb or duck.
I think it went into me.
You're still gonna pay me, right? Or something a little less selfish.
What?
Yeah, ah, but Pheebs don't you think he's a little young to get married?
Yeah, isn't it fantastic?
A little tight? I could see double-oh and seven in those pants.
I would but mine doesn't fit. The pants are a little tight.
Hey! Okay, so I thought we'd start with my make up and then do my hair.
Thanks.
Okay, it's baby time. Pants off Bing. Didn't see you there Geller.
Good-bye.
'S'going pretty good, y'know? It's nice, and, we're having fun.
This Alan again? How's it goin'?
I didn't even tell him to say that. . All right you're off my list.
I'm sorry. You're not easy-going, but you're passionate, and that's good. And when you get upset about the little things, I think that I'm pretty good about making you feel better about that. And that's good too. So, they can say that you're high maintenance, but it's okay, because I like ... maintaining you.
Anyway erm, are you going to get a handyman to install this stuff?
Oh...baby-proofing... Why is this such a big deal now? Y'know, when I was a kid it was like.. "Whoops! Joey fell down the stairs!" or er.. "Whoops! Joey electrocuted himself again!" Huh!
Okay, I feel like I'm talking to Lassie. All right, Phoebe would you just tell me!
I don't know!
Yeah, he used to have this recurring nightmare, just really freaked him out.
He saw a therapist?
Yeah sure, nature called, she wanted to see who else did.
You just thought of that in there?
Ok, but if something gets broken, and then the Queen comes over..
What is the point of having them if we never use them?
Hey Rach, the tampons here are only a penny. Let's stock up.
I ate a bug.
Look look! It's Rachel and Barry. No, don't everybody look at once!
Oh, no-no-no-no. Last time I left a spontaneous message I ended up using the phrase "Yes indeedy-o."
Guys, rules are good! Rules help control the fun! Ohhh!
I think I'm gonna take-off.
Forget it. Not after your cousin who could belch the alphabet.
Monica, I'm tellin' you, this guy is perfect for you.
Wait, what about the time I hit you in the face with the Silvian's pumpkin?
Oh.
We ripped that couple apart, and kept the pieces for ourselves.
Excellent.
Oh, it's so beautiful. Ohh! Y'know, I-I don't know if I feel right about this.
Well, Ross and Emily aren't gonna use it.
Sweetie, you know I have no sense of humor when it comes to the wedding.
I figured I'd buy those. Pat, I'd like to buy a vow.
Rach? Can I talk to for just a minute? I-I dropped some socks.
Umm, listen, I'm gonna need to take a rain check, my roommate is just really sick. Okay? Bye! Honey, listen, I know, I know things seem so bad right now.
No, but she likes me. You abandoned her on a plane to Greece.
Oh, so-so you talked to her. Did she, did she sound mad?
Well, this must've brought back some really bad memories for you, Ross.
Okay.
And then he told me he would run away with me, and he didn't.
Yes, yes it is true. And I know this because, because he pretended to be Drake to, to sleep with me.
Did you also have his album, It's Not Easy Being Green?
Oh! I used to do that too!
I'm guessing your new girlfriend wouldn't urinate on my coffee table.
'That thing'? This is how you greet guests at a party? Let me ask you something, if I showed up here with my new girlfriend, she wouldn't be welcome in your home?
Ooh! I'm sorry! I think, I THINK, that may have missed the table!
AAAHHHH!
Y'know, I-I... I have to figure...some st-Y'know, some stuff before I can...
I know.
Yes, I will start with the carpaccio, and then I'll have the grilled prawns.
Do I dare ask?
I need two. I'm bringing Pete. My boyfriend. I have a boyfriend now!
I had one.
Oh Ross, sometimes grown-ups have commitments they just can't get out of!
Yeah, I was but uh, she was a little busy with a water balloon fight.
Wait a minute, wait a minute. Yes he is. You are totally different.
She's right. She's right. You are no different than the rest of them.
Say it louder, I don't think the guy all the way in the back heard you!
Oh my God! You're a 30 year old virgin!
I can't belive it, I'm gonna be an aunt. I'm gonna have like a nephew.
Monica, come on now. Let's go, baby coming.
Michelle! Of course, it was Michelle! Did it sound like Michelle?
Maybe it was his sister's. You know, maybe it was his daughter's.
Well, next time your massaging him, you should try and distract yourself.
No, I know! I-I'm sorry, but the moment I touch him, I just wanna throw out my old oath and take a new, dirty one.
Ok, you're being wierd. Do you want sex or did you do something bad?
Oh no..don't thank me. Thank you. You know there's not one thing I would change about you? Not one single thing! And definitely not... two... single things.
Excuse me, Mrs. Burkart? Well, we're all cleaned up in the kitchen.
Oh, all right. Oh! Look what we almost took!
Ugh, they sent me home. They said I can't work if I'm sick.
Hey, what are you doing here? Shouldn't you be at work?
Oh Rachel don't, don't you dare, don't, don't. Tell him I cook.
OK, I'm doin' it for ya.
Hey, we would still be living here if hadn't gotten the question wrong!
That is not true. She did! She forced me!
Carol called me to thank me for the lasagna, I asked, she told me.
Wha, heh, how could you know, I don't even know!
Look what I found in the drawer... And you said I'd never wear this...
Okay.
Oh! It was our pleasure. We are so much enjoying getting to know you.
Thanks so much for showing me around.
What I said was, was that I understood. Joey's the one who agreed with you!
That's what you said last night.
Oh, I asked one of the waitresses at work if she'd help me out.
Ten dollars an hour for what?
Which we are, and-and we already paid for it. It's My Giant!
Well, I suppose I'd have to say you!! But, what if we're watching a movie in here?
Wendy, we had a deal! Yeah, you promised! Wendy! Wendy! Wendy!
Last time I do that, I promise.
Where's Benny? There he is! Where's Benny, there he is.
Well, I think you should seriously consider the marriage thing, give Rachel another chance to dress up like Princess Bubble Yum.
Cute PJ's! You're really livin' it up here in London huh?
Hey!
No, but... I saw the previews. They played it right before Jackass.
You saw that?
No! You don't know the system! There'll be nobody messing with the system!
Need some help?
Do you think things would have been better if you'd just told her the truth?
I'm not sure I know what you're getting at.
Dr. Greene. Oh my God it's Rachel's dad. What're you doing here?
Oh that's nice. Happy birthday Rachel, here's some goo.
Yes, I want to change. And why-why don't you go down and get us a table?
Yes, we do. But, we have to change first.
Were not doing anything. Were just sitting around talking, quietly.
Youre doing it again.
Oh that's so sweet! Look Chandler I don't care if you can't cry, I love you.
Yeah I know, but I figured a shot y'know? Maybe one of those stories would make me cry and then you wouldn't think I was y'know, all dead inside.
We're gonna pick up the wedding dress then we're gonna have lunch with mom.
Oh, where are you guys going?
I know! I know! And he totally freaked out and I can't find him anywhere!
Well for the regular guy, it's bad, but Chandler, Oh dear God!
You'll be fine. Nah, you won't, but I'll be back in two minutes.
It's just that we've never spent any time, you know, alone together.
Op, can I just tell you something? Very flattered but umm, I'm engaged.
Hi!
You are so sweet to notice! Yes, I lost three and a half pounds!
Ohh, so do you! Did you lose weight?
Frannie was the one who found your Playboys and showed them to mom.
Now wait a minute, you be nice! All right? I didn't bring you here so you can ambush her.
This is so great! This is exactly how we set the plates at the restaurant.
Okay, I'm a rookie. I should not be in the end zone.
'Cause I ran into him at the bank, he is still soo cute.
The guy who took Rachel to the prom? Why is he calling you?
Oh, honey, I forgot. I promised Treeger that we'd leave our keys.
Do you realise we almost made it ten years without that coming up?
well no offense honey, but your taste is a little feminine for me.
Why?
Phoebe! Come on! Let's go! Come on! Why aren't you dressed yet?!
I did it anyway.
What if my own baby hates me? Huh? What am I gonna do then?
Come on, don't do this.
Oh no, she's still at work, but she told me to tell you to call her.
What is ah, Rach in her room?
Ah, come on, sneakers are easy. You wear sneakers all the time.
What am I supposed to do with these?
I just thought that if I could follow the wire I could find out what it did.
I don't care! The wires have come loose in your head!
Wow. My brother never even told me when he lost his virginity.
You know what else? He's unbelievable in bed.
Oh, hang on, hang on. Does Aunt Monica get a say in this?
That's right, you're gonna spend tomorrow at Aunt Rachel's, aren't you.
I got one. "Socks. Because your family's feet deserve the best."
I mean, I can write slogans. I mean, how hard can it be, right? "Cheese. It's milk that you chew." "Crackers. Because your cheese needs a buddy." "A grape. Because who can get a water melon in your mouth?"
I don't know. Hey, Rachel, you want the big plate? I want you to have the big plate.
What the hell is that?
'Cause, Gary and Phoebe think they're a hotter couple than we are!
Why?
Oh... Yes, I'm sure. Oh honey, let's go. Okay bye everyone.
Ooh! Are you sure?
STOP IT!! ...Oh my God. It's true! Who am I?
Someone's left a glass on the coffee table. There's no coaster. It's a cold drink, it's a hot day. Little beads of condensation are inching their way closer and closer to the surface of the wood...
Have a seat. Okay, listen umm, Chandler and I are going to live together, here.
All yours babe.
I'm telling you, she went to the airport, and she's gonna go for it with Ross!
No way!
Okay, the red ones are my guests and the blue ones are yours.
Oh wow. Why don't we just take me and put me with a Manhattan in my hand, talking to the cute bartender. These pins aren't for playing are they?
Because they don't know we're dating. Do you think we should eat in the kitchen?
Why can't I tell them that we live together?
You should feel great about yourself! You're doing this amazing independence thing!
C'mon, sit. Just sit down, sit.
I know, but y'know, this time you're gonna definitely know whether or not you did it!
Oh totally, totally. Y'know it's not that big of deal, we already kinda did it once y'know.
Hey, you know I got a question for ya. Just a little thing, no pressure.
Awww! You know that's probably why babies learn to talk, so they can tell grown ups to cut it out.
Not the way they're doing it. What, what happened? How did she die?
It's okay. Actually y'know what, it's kinda cool. 'Cause it's like y'know, one life ends and another begins.
Because... I'm Monica Geller. It was my credit card you were using.
I'm not too bad. Fortunately, blue's my colour. How-how did you know I was here?
I don't know. I mean, I guess having sex in front of a baby isn't so...
Well, I can't say "hump" or "screw" in front of the B-A-B-Y.
Wow! All right well, I mean, what can you do? If you lost it you lost it.
Umm, I lost one of your earrings. I'm sorry! I am so, so sorry!
Who's so brave, you're so brave, yes you are, you're so brave.
Here. Ben, do you wanna play the airplane game, do you wanna show Rachel? Come here. We're gonna do something fun. Okay. Weee!! Weee!!
Yeah! But, he can't not exactly see Emily, I mean that's his wife.
Well, you can't just not see Rachel anymore, she's one of your best friends.
Uh, so anyway, we thought one of you could read something during the ceremony.
Monica said wedding.
Ohh, he's really shy. I-I don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet.
So Mon, when are we gonna meet this new secret waiter man?
Oh good, another dinosaur story. When are those gonna become extinct?
I love how he cares so much about stuff. If I squint I can pretend he's Alan Alda.
Now another way to organise your stuffed animals, is by size.
Some can sing, some can dance. I apparently can turn phallic cakes into woodland creatures.
What does he think? Does he think I'm just gonna wait around for nothing?
I don't know! I haven't totally decided how to talk on my boat yet.
Just a little but...it's just so scary! I don't even know what I would sing...
OK so isn't there a little part of you that wants to get up there?
Uhm, she has been showing us houses outside of the city.
Why do you have a realtor?
It worked! Ooh baby baby baby, ooh baby baby baby!
Have I gone deaf?
Yeah, it's just we don't think of you as really being so much "with the words".
Joey, we would've asked you, we just thought you wouldn't be interested.
Ok, alright, you guys, you'd better sit down, this is pretty big.
What's going on?
Two it is. Ok, time for bed, I'm gonna go brush my teeth.
Well, I mean what can I say? I, I was married to Barbara for 30 years. She was my high school sweetheart, now you, that's two.
Hey, thank you. Thank you so much. . You are SO going to Heaven!
Yeah, I did.
Now there you go! I wouldn't want my best guest to strain her eyes!
This is where I keep the pizza. And-Hey! Where did the napkin go?!
Okay. We have got to beat them! {Here we go yet again.}
Uh, yeah.
Okay, one more, please. Come on, I'm gonna get it in this time, I will.
Oh, yeah! Okay! Great! Go, man, go put on your shoes, and, and march out there and meet her! Oh, wait, no, no you have to take a shower, 'cause, eww. No, you know what you have to answer her, answer her first. No, no, you know what make some coffee 'cause its too much.
Well yeah, but, you know, uh, 27 is a dangerous eye age.
Didn't you like, just get your eyes checked?
Well, we... "bore false witness"... See I could be a reverend.
So you lied to me before?
Got it! Got it! Got it! Got it! Got it! Got it!
No its really okay... Monica!
Wow, Monica! What an amazing opportunity to influence... dozens of people.
Well, I'm gonna fill in for him as food critic for the Chelsea Reporter.
Aren't you afraid that Joey's going to figure all of this out? I heard it.
Hear me out woman. I'll go down the fire escape. Then, I'll wait for a while. Then, when I come up the stairs, it'll be just like I just got back from Tulsa. Then, Joey and I will come in and see that there's no guy in here.
No! no! Let's figure out a fair way to decide who's staying.
Well, oh, ok now... Only one of us has to stay with Emma. Ok, and as the person who realized that, I get to go!
Umm, listen I am sorry, but I'll put some out first thing in the morning.
I am sorry, but some of us have to get up early and go to work! He does not know that I am not some of us.
You want a job? Turn off "Oprah," and send out a resume!
Well, I think it's great that you're going on a date, you know? I mean, it sounds healthy. I mean, you have needs. Embrace your womanhood!
Thank you. It was so beautiful. I'm going to go to Joeys and get the pies.
It's all right. You can mourn.
It's harder for me! I have those four other women to compete with!
I do like that.
Probably some y'know, European good-bye thing he picked up in London.
See ya!! What the hell was that?!
Come on! Come on, I was kidding! It was such an obvious joke!
What?!!
Well, we thought we would all go to a picnic , in Central Park!
Ohh, that's so nice! How great! Well, where? Where's the trip?!
Hey Maureen! Gosh! Hey uh, Chandler? This is my cousin Maureen.
Hi! If you're calling before Saturday, you've reached Monica and Chandler. But if you're calling after Saturday, you've reached Mr. and Mrs. Bing! Please leave a message for the Bings!
Joey, we had a deal. That-that's why you're here! I've got to fire you!
I am so-so-so sorry. I was gonna do it! Really! But I was standing there with 327 dollars in one hand and 238 dollars in the other hand, and I was thinking, "Wow! It's been a long time since I had... 327 + 238 dollars!"
Well, he did manage to keep his identity secret for a long time.
Ross is Batman!
Joey, did you even interview this woman before you asked her to move in?
Oh, hey let me.
It's goin' great. Right on schedule. Got my little happy helpers.
How's it going?
So that marriage stuff that you were saying yesterday, you don't really believe that do you?
Wh-no, but y'know who did stop in here looking for ya, Tennille.
All right shut up for a second and let me just see something. Oh, wow!
I'm sorry things didn't work out...
I want you to meet someone really special. Phoebe, this is Erica. And this is the baby!
Hey.
Well, they're just gonna have to wait aren't they? I've only got two hands!!
Hey, there's uh, some people outside, askin' about candy.
There's something that we wanna tell you. We decided to name the girl-baby Erica.
We're going to take Erica to recovery now.
No way! You had your party, now I have mine! Is everything alright?
Hi. Thanks for the party, honey. Should I help you clean up?
Wait! Wait! Wait! You can't start today! Today's the rehearsal dinner!
Oh that's great!
You are going to make a joke about my special present! Why would you do that?!
Op, but the twelfth brings a lover's spat.
Okay, I'll rest. But y'know if I'm going to bed, then you're coming with me.
I know, let's rest and drink lots of fluids.
Well, with all these doctors and nurses, I'm gonna say, midget rodeo.
Where are we?
Oh that's cute! We really all enjoyed it. But y'know, it doesn't count.
The most popular Phoebe in tennis is called the overhand Phoebe. And if you win, you must slap your opponent on the Phoebe and say, "Hi, Phoebe!"
Hello? Oh yes, one minute please. It's for you. It's the fire inspector.
Okay.
Come on, okay, come on this is for all womankind. Let's kill 'um!
Oh my God! You dated someone with a glass eye too?!
Hey Rach, come on! We're gonna be late for the eye doctor appointment!
Thank you.
Oh, then you do know it. So um what kind of things do you write about?
Actually I ah, I am a poet.
Oh my God, he's gonna do it now. Please, I cannot watch this, let's go.
Uh, Phoebe, uh, I have... something I wanna say.
OK, great. You'll tell us and we'll laugh. Let's play poker.
Oh God, oh, and then she told the funniest story...
What does the red X next to Bob Greenmore's name mean?
Oh!
Come on, that was back in high school! How could that still bother you?
Monica! I couldn't find him for two hours! He was having sex with Amy Welch!
Hey, hold on there, tiger. How's it going? How you holding up?
Oh, no, no, no. Presents first. Food later.
I-I am serious, I mean, we're, we're all over each other all the time.
Come on, seriously! When did it end?
Well, do you think he was waiting 'til after you left, so he could cry?
No.
Alright, here we go. We've got salmon roulettes and assorted crudites.
Oh, you're...
Oh no no no no... this is dangerous territory. Keep it clean!
Thanks, you look good too.
Oh, is that why you did it the secret hallway where nobody ever goes?!
I swear, I never wanted any part of your night!
No, he didn't! He pretended to be a Quaker to get out of Korea.
Hey, hey, hey, hey! I'm not gonna mess with Jack, he's a great man, he fought for our country.
Look, I-I'm never gonna let you up so you may as well just go away.
Why? So you could hang up on me?
I'm telling-If you put that in her apartment you'll never hear the end of it.
Yeah! I made it of this fruit bowl I found in the garbage.
Ross! She's giving us her baby. She can eat you if she wants.
Erica, those things aren't free. In fact they have one of the highest mark-ups of any consumer product...
: I saw what you were doing in Tulsa. angry sharks turn you on!
let ME be a part of this!
Vomit tux? Who vomited on-y'know what, what you up to Joe?
Don't worry, I had it dry-cleaned.
Phoebe, it's okay that you don't want me to be your girlfriend because I have the best boyfriend.
I'm off the list.
No I didn't, I said kiwi lime. That's what makes it so special.
Kiwi? Kiwi? I thought it was a key lime pie.
Oh, that's because I had lunch with Rich-Me neither! Okay, what do I want now?
Yes!! I love you! I can't even remember what we were fighting about!
All right, that's it. You know what? Just get out of my way and stop moping.
I don't know. It's just not the same without Mom in the kitchen.
Y'see, this is where you'd use that 'hello' word we talked about.
She answered.
No-no-no that was good, it was, that was uh, that was a goood kiss...
No-no really, was-was that not okay?
Oh no! My parents have never seen me drunk! That they know of.
Yes!!
It's gonna be weird to watch some actor pretending to be Ben's dad.
All right, I gotta take off. I'm picking up Ben then we're off to the big audition.
No, my eye doctor is Richard! I can't go to him when I don't have a boyfriend!
Honey, maybe we should take you to a doctor.
I'm gonna leave some cards here. Please think of us for you next event.
Good.
Y'know when I said to you earlier that I was at work umm, I'm at my new work.
Oh! What a great way to earn some extra pocket money.
No, no really. I.. I wouldn't feel right about it. Just some water.
If... if you want to drink, it's OK with me, I've got to get used to it.
Oh! And don't let me leave without getting the name of that carpet guy.
Remember, a virgin for me please.
Okay, but wouldn't it be easier if you had to tell me something that you could tell me.
But I can't tell you.
Sure! It doesn't mean anything! Just like I know it doesn't mean anything with you!
So umm, you-you flirt with guys all the time?
But what if it is better than ours? Should we at least look?
We close escrow tomorrow, so seeing another house can only confuse us, and we're easily confused. We're not very bright.
Ah, thank you. This building does have a wholesome family feel to it.
Your place is just lovely.
We don't have much time. Once the egg descended the oviduct ...
Do, do you gonna do it now?
: sweetie it's ok, I still love you, let me be a part of this.
What's going on?
Yeah, and I wanted her to get to know the doctors and get settled into the hotel.
Hey, well, in a couple of weeks I won't be able to travel.
Oh that's my doodle of a ladybug, with a top hat. She's fancy.
What's that on the bottom?
Oh my God! Joey, what did you do after you threw her leg on the fire?
I wish. See, I guess another thing I probably should've told you about Ginger is that she kinda has a ah, artificial leg.
Oh that's okay. Don't worry about it, you can give it to me when we get back.
How do you feel about the, "I really did forgot the present, please forgive me" not fake out?
When you were reading the dirty magazines without taking off the plastic!
I was with you the whole time we were in Connecticut, when did you even get those?
Oh my God! No wonder I get such great service at Cafe Maurice.
Well, you just asked if I wanted to go to bed with you tonight.
Wait wait wait. I was at home the whole time. How did I missed that?
Yeah. It was after the party, we were on the balcony and...
All right, well why don't I go out with an ex-boyfriend and do Joey a favor?!
Not once!
I can't believe we are at a real college party! I have to pee so bad!
Remember that big party? Freshman year? A week before Christmas vacation? I do. You had some visitors.
Mira, Ross, Marcel se llevo el control remoto.
Hola, amigos!
Oh, you came to tell him you love him! I knew it! I was right! I'm right, right?
I was going to call him, but...
I'm glad you're here, we have a couple of things to ask you about the wedding ceremony.
No.
Uh, listen, I need that broiling pan that Joey borrowed the other day.
Hey!
This is so unfair! She's got everything I want, and she doesn't have my mother.
Nooo...
You have to help me! I'm supposed to be writing my vows and all I have is this!
What is the emergency?!
Oh, Nancy Thompson from Phoebe's old massage place is getting fired.
No, he visited a little town south of throw up. So what was Phoebe's secret?
Joey, this is sick, it's disgusting, it's, it'snot really true, is it?
Oh, like you've never gotten a little rambunctious with Ross.
You know what? This has been kind of a girlie day. You're right, I'm sorry.
Yes, but I feel like I've really gotten in touch with my feminine side enough today. You know. In fact I think we're two sachets away from becoming a lesbian couple.
You know what probably happened? Someone musta stolen my credit card.
Mon, if uh you were at lunch alone, how come it cost you uh 53 dollars?
Rose Marie really belongs on a smaller screen, doesn't she?
Woah!
Ohhh! No! This is my friend Rachel, we went to High School together.
I know, here-here!!
Uhm, we just wanna give you a heads-up. Bill and Colleen hate us.
Hey.
Okay! There's only one left, three letter word, not dog but...
Aww, me too. Now let's finish this and go to bed.
Hey guys! Do you wanna look at the song list for the wedding? Guys?
Okay!
Well, you don't have to decide right now, but if you could just look at our file...
Giving you my baby? You think I'd give you my child after this?
Wow! Play that message for Emily and this whole problem goes away!
Hey Ross! It's you! I just want you to remember this feeling. You are lucky to be alive! So live everyday to the fullest. Love yourself, okay? Okay. Oh, and also get stamps. Bye!
All right, hand me that other box of photos; that's the very last one.
Great! Thanks!
Oh my God! Did you hear that? She hired me because she thinks I'm good.
Oh, well Richard raved about the food at his party, of course you were sleeping with him. Then I heard the food at that lesbian wedding was very nice, I assume you weren't sleeping with anybody there. Though, at least that would be something.
I have no idea, but X-rays alone could be a couple hundred dollars.
Why, how much is this gonna cost?
"Oh my God, I love Ross! I hate Ross! I love Ross! I hate Ross!"
Hey! I call her!
So, I'm, I'm probably still ovulating. Do you want to give it another try?
Mhum.
I'm just having one of those days where you realize you're in a dead-end relationship!
Whoa-whoa, what's the matter?! Talk to the captain!
Ohh, I've always wanted to go to this culinary fair that they have in Jersey!
Yeah, I can say that I have a conference and you can say you have a chef thing.
...They threw us out! I was thrown out of a hotel! Me!
So once they caught on to the fact that we're, y'know, short and have breasts...
Yes! All right, y'know what? Why don't we start with a practice run? Okay?
Really?!
Ross's apartment is nice! How come we don't hang out here more often?
It's just my knitting that's all! Yes! I knit this. I'm very good.
Ice, ice, ice squares anyone? Take a napkin. Alright.
It's hard to tell because I'm sweating, but I use exactly what the gel bottle says, an amount about the size of a pea. How, how can that be too much?
Now you think I wouldn't enjoy that, because it is so fake, but I still do.
Well, I was going to, but then I figured, you know... you're food is so delicious and perfect, you can never have too many of those pumpkin things.
Listen...I need to know that what I'm about to ask you, will never get back to Chandler.
Hey!
They've elected me to talk to you about the baby talk - it's not so good.
Bye.
Oh, Aunt Liddy's coming? That means we get five dollars each!
She went to pick up Aunt Liddy.
I gotcha. Sorry. So, did you ever make him throw up a whole anything?
No, not us... Us!
This dinner is gonna be so great! In your face, last year "me"!
Can't wait!
Yeah, I do think it's better this way. Yeah, we're being smart. Yes, I'm sure.
So, how'd the lasagne go over? Really?! Good. So you owe me three pretty things. Yeah, I've been thinking a lot about you too. I know. It's hard this whole platonic thing. It's a word!
Well, he told me he was going out with the guys, I just didn't know that you were the guys.
Yeah, didn't he tell ya?
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Phoebe. It's just a little shorter than what we had discussed.
Yeah, but this isn't the face of a person who trusts a person. Ok, this is the face of a person who, you know, doesn't trust a person.
Come on...I just need it for some rent and..and some other bills.
And I think he would tell you it was a mistake.
Ross used to stay up every Saturday night to watch Golden Girls!
Once Monica was sent to her room without dinner, so she ate the macaroni off a jewelry box she'd made.
Chandler, listen to me sweetie, I know you can do this. Okay? You have a beautiful smile.
No, I am.
It wasn't funny at all! Why would you do that? Why didn't you pick me?
I guess it was kinda funny.
Do you want me to cry? Is that what you want? Do you wanna see me cry?
Monica, how did this happen? I thought you had this all planned out.
Wow, that is a surprise. Just one little question, uh, why not Ross's room?
Well sweetie, we have a surprise for you. We're turning your room into a gym.
So you wanna tell us now, or are we waiting for four wet bridesmaids?
Hi.
Chandler! I have to tell you, you smell so smokey I have to get up. I'm not kidding.
Okay, but you gotta push past this because it is about to get so good!
It's my new perfume. Why don't you come closer where you can really appreciate it?
I'm doing just fine! God, Tiffany, you smell so great!
Oh, what a great gift! Is The Way You Look Tonight on it?!
But I made you a tape of what I think are all romantic songs.
Well, now's a good time. I'm on my way to have my ears cut off.
Hey. I need to tell you something.
Now are drawers will smell nice and we didn't waste these pantyhose.
Hello. Oh good. Ross could you put up some of these flyers for me? OH!! Demon!! Demon!!
Look, I don't wanna do this test either, but I really do think it's a good idea!
I cannot believe Ross told you that! And in my defense, it was a Wendy's!
I'm sick of the signs! It's too fast, I'm happy the way things are!
All right, should we just, should we just get married? Y'know? I mean should we just do it? All the signs are telling us to do it.
Hey, honey, my test is down the hall, are you sure you're going to be ok?
Deposit my specimen? You know, usually I have to call a 900 number for that kind of talk. Thanks, got it.
You were the next caller five hours ago. You must be going crazy.
Thank you for your patience, you're the next caller.
Hi Honey! We're all here; we just want to wish you a Merry Christmas.
Ah. Chandler Bing.
I got it! How about, if we win, they have to get rid of the rooster?
Okay, so let's play for some pepper! Stop spending my money!
The basket is totally empty! My God, the neighbors ate all the candy!
No, I've just always wanted to do that. Can you help me clean this up?
Oh, you can't show Phoebe this! She hates those corporate massage chains.
Oh, it's a gift certificate to this new SPA in SOHO.
Why, it's dinner for six. 5 steaks, and an eggplant for Phoebe.
Oh, it's like a skit.
Hey. So um, I was thinking that maybe we should start dividing up our stuff.
Hey!
They wouldn't have put it there if it didn't do something! How can you not care?
I know what it did! Nothing.
Danny? You know Rachel? She's nice. She's not bad to look at, right?
Hey Danny.
Do you remember that jacket that you love so much, that you thought was too expensive?
Yeah!
Let me put it this way. We're having sex whether you're here or not.
I don't feel like having sex. Maybe we can watch a movie or something.
Good, so do it Saturday night because we're going to dinner with her and Clark.
Yes!!!
Oh God! He's gonna come by and borrow some candles for his big date!
Oh, I wish there was a job where I could wear this all the time. Maybe someday, there will be.
Since we've been going out, I think I've mentioned his name twice!
Oh, Richard. That's all I ever hear, Richard, Richard, Richard!
Maybe Joey doesn't have to give you the money, TV stars have assistants right?
Ehh.
I know this is embarrassing, but nobody cares! No one here even knows you!
Yeah, I guess!
Y'know what? It really creeps me out choosing other people's sex clothes.
Hey, Mon, if you were hoping to sleep with Joshua the first time tonight, which one of these would you want to be wearing.
Okay. I'm gonna be the mom that makes the world's best chocolate chip cookies.
Break my heart-Oh, all right.
I understand, but you're wishing for what we think you're wishing for, aren't you?
Can't really say!
Hey Rach, a guy from Ralph Lauren called, you got a second interview!
Thanks Chandler.
Come on! Come on! Hurry! We're running out of time! Huddle up!
Okay, okay, so we get to take that stupid troll thing home!
What?! Why? Why is this crazy? So this isn't the ideal way to something....
Crazy.
No. I think we learned that from the sugarlips incident. I'm gonna get some tea.
Yeah, see, I can't pull of baby-doll can I?
Rachel, I need to borrow-You're not packed!!!! You're not packed even a little bit!
Well, what you're wearing is fine for that.
Oh! I hate that guy! I mean come on kid! Pull up your pants!
Sense the tone! No that kid Nate got it.
You're wrong! The centerpieces are fine! Do you ever get scared at all?
Okay. Well, I think the centerpieces are too big
Really? Wow! It looks like I had some trouble staying inside the lines.
Yeah. Yeah, oh you loved that thing. You always had it with you. You never went anywhere without-without that coloring book.
Well, it doesn't really matter ... you're both wishing for the same thing, right?
I hope I win!
And what if I was still fat? Well, you wouldn't be dating me, that's for sure.
Maybe the problem was you were pronouncing it kara-tay.
Uh, ah. Unless you wanna stay over? I mean, I'm going to, so...
What?
Bye! Ten bucks says, I never see that woman again in my life.
Bye!
I'm telling you, something's wrong! My brother does not stay out all night.
Okay y'know what, because you said that, I'm not putting out tonight.
Maybe I can try at intermission? Phoebe, come on... you know what? Let's just go!
You didn't get the money, did you?
'Cause if you do that means you'd be cancelling it for me, and we're just friends.
Okay.
The second sister dies in Archie and Jughead Double Digest?
No. No, I-I was, I was talking about the book I was reading.
So umm, when I was in the shower I was thinking about our first night in London...
Happy Anniversary, 10 months!
Oh no-no-no, stay, stay, stay, just keep talking. I'm always the hostess.
Look, Mon, do you want us to uh, come back later?
Yeah, come on, eat, whatever you want. Dr. Roger got beeped again.
Okay to come in?
So you can't lose, it's there in the title. Wonderfullness is baked right in.
It's a Wonderful Life. Yes I've heard of this.
I know there'll be other houses, but it's just so... I love that one so much.
And about this Nancy thing... If you're not sleeping with her, should I?
Oh, great! Just what you want for a new house with infants. Bird feces.
Really? You got us a chick and a duck?
Chandler, this is not our problem. We've got each other. That's all that matters.
Oh, yeah, well, poor Richard. Y'... I can grow a moustache!
So what if he wants to sleep with her? I mean, she's single and he's cute.
We ran into him on the street today and he said he might have a job for her. But I know he just wants to get into her pants.
Oh, you're so sweet. Oh, but wait, what about our, what about the future and stuff?
Yeah, I'm putting my foot down. Yeah look, when I proposed I told you that I would do anything to make you happy, and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy then, then that's what we're gonna do.
I'm gonna go put my make up on, we have to be at the hotel in an hour!
I know. At dusk. That's such a hard time for me.
I guess with you doing the internship, we're just spending more than we're bringing in.
I'm not sure what they did, but I'm inclined to blame Enron.
Hi. We checked the third and fourth floor, no-one's seen Marcel.
Cat! What'm I saying? Cat!
You're not gonna go anywhere, you said you were gonna eat here, and you're gonna eat here!
Dude, we were good!
Because that's where the party is you goon. See this is just the staging area.
Uhh, yes, absdolutely, um. Why again?
How about you go put on your 007 tuxedo and I'll make you a nice martini.
Batman has Robin! We get ESPN right?
Hey, maybe I'll drive you up there! I'd like to buy some tickets myself!
Yeah Connecticut...Not West Virginia.
They all came from the list you handed out to us two weeks ago.
Good ones?
But what kind of a sick bastard wants to do it in front of a deer?
You guess I'm right? When we stayed at that bed and breakfast, you wouldn't have sex with me because you thought a deer was staring through the window.
You had sex in his chair?!... I said that a little too loudly, didn't I?
We ended up having sex in his chair.
All right look, if I take Chandler out of the running will you be able to focus?
It's hard, y'know, his huddle is closer to Dutch girl.
All right. We're gonna go. It's not for another six hours. We're gonna go then.
Fine.
Wait a minute, I think Phoebe's right. You know I hear someone else in there with him.
He could be alone. This morning I heard him do push-ups, and then talk to his triceps.
What are you talking about? She just invited him to the biggest party of the millennium!
I don't think so.
OK, I'll go. OK, senior year of college... on a pool table.
Alright, somebody.
Well fine! I want to meet this chicken expert! Send the Colonel in!
She says it's to dry now and she wants to come back here and explain to you exactly how she wants it.
Ohh, Please?! I'm a single mom, with a thirty year old son!!
Ahh, you know what? That is....Who wouldn't want you?
You! It's not like it's a big deal! You-you don't still do it or anything!
Okay, okay, I'll tell 'em it wasn't Chandler who got high. Now who should I say it was?
Well, y'know how I always wanted to go out with Chip Matthews in high school?
So, how was your date?
Chandler could you at least send some women to my party? Alright that's Ross.
Alright you guys are off to party number one and you, you are off to party number two Alright fellas, let's keep it movin', let' keep it movin.
I would get a room with this cake. I think I could show this cake a good time!
My God, get a room!
I don't know! Time to kiss a guy maybe?! What are you laughing at Pampers?
Quick! What time is it?!
But we were hoping that since we told you the truth that you still might consider...
I can't believe this.
Baddest. Otherwise the song would be Fat Fat Leroy Brown.
Monica... Hey Mon, I have a question. Is Leroy the baddest man in the whole damn town or the fattest man in the whole damn town?
See what happens when you give people advice? I hope you told him not to?
David is going to propose to Phoebe tonight!
Okay, I'd like to know how much the room was because I'd like to pay my half.
Monica.
Pheebs, you remember how we talked about saying things quietly to yourself first?
Oh my God. You'd put that poor little creature in jail?
Couldn't you just stay like this forever? Chandler! Couldn't you just stay here forever?
Hmm.
Went down to the docks. Bet ya didn't know you could get it wholesale.
Where'd you get fruit at four in the morning?
I mean, I realize that his feelings may never completely go away, but you can.
Feelings, such strong feelings.
Oh! You assume because I was heavy that's the only way I could win something?
Pie eating contest?
Well, y'know I-I-I think I'm gonna respect the privacy of my new secret boyfriend.
Chandler! Is he?
In the beginning where y'know it's all sex and talking and sex and talking and...
Yes. Right where?
Probably the only time I'll ever say this, but did you see the ass on her?
I know!
ooohh... hey! Wanna stick around and I'll whip you up some dinner?
I'm sorry too...
Rachel, what are you doing? Its freezing out here. Would you come back inside?
Yeah, um, may we help you?
What? We took a walk, nothing happened. I can back with nothing all over me.
All right, that's it, you guys! What happened out there?
Oh. So nice of her to pull my hair, 'till I dropped the key!
Hey Mon, that was really nice of you to loan Rachel your car so she could go and get the cake.
You know, when you start get screwed over all the time, you gotta switch to low-fat.
Yeah, well that's that lo-cal, non dairy, soy milk junk. We sort of, we save the real stuff for those really terminal cases.
Do NOT let me sit in one of those. We'll be here for days.
Oh.
Ok, everybody, there's food and drinks on the table. Go across the hall.
All right.
It meant nothing! Okay? After all this time, how can you not trust me?
No! Her boyfriend Richard!
Yeah! Okay, this one is a mushroom cap. Umm, this one is made of bologna.
Wow! This looks great!
OK, we done with the chit-chat? Are we ready to play some serious poker?
Ooooh, that's fine. We'll see who has the last laugh there, monkey boy.
They're all in there! Even these five that I hid in my bra ...
Hey Monica, what about your extra tickets?
You wanna go right now? 'Cause I'll take you right now, buddy! You wanna go?
Yeah.
What?! You paid a thousand dollars for a cat when you owe me 300!!
Doesn't sound as crazy as paying a thousand dollars for a cat.
All right, he's keys are in the drawer. Y'know what? I also need some cash.
No honey, it's okay! Listen, I'll got to Ross's and get the blender, you get all the margarita stuff ready.
Alright, I'll give you the ear thing but don't you think the ending was pretty wonderful?
Oh yeah. You know, I don't know if I was happier when um George Bailey destroyed the family business or um, Donna Reid cried, or when the mean pharmacist made his ear bleed.
I'm gonna go into the bathroom so I can look at it in the mirror, as I eat it.
I'll help you dial.
Okay. Man, I have not made this many cookies since I was in the ninth grade.
Let's give it a shot.
Mhm, helpful brother - creepy loner at teen movie.
Mhm, packing - sexy cheerleader comedy.
Hello Dan! I'm really looking forward to Saturday night! Really, really!
Nice to meet you.
Hello! Were we at the same table? It's like... cocktails in Appalachia.
What?
Rachel-Rachel-Rachel I-I cannot, I can't let-, actually I kinda want to see what happens.
No-n-n-n-no! I am finally thinking clearly. My lucky dress wasn't working out to well for me, but for four years, this baby never missed.
Al-alright, l-look you guys, this is the best relationship I've been in. . .
She's not a twinkie.
Honey, you've been really strong about this, I know how badly you wanted that job.
Oh yeah, it's a good idea!
: OK... Dear Ms. Green... yeah... yeah... yeah... No.
: We have apple cinnamon...
Yeah, a-a-and clean. Not just health department clean... Monica clean.
Oh, that's great.
What the... Yes you're too late! Where was all this three years ago?!
I know this is crazy but am I too late?
Ok..You know the old classics you know,You look nice? They're still ok.
No no! I just love the way you look, I am warm, for your form.
Phoebe, he's a friend of my parents. He's like 20 years older than me.
So. You two are totally into each other.
I don't understand, I mean am I so hard to live, is this why I don't have a boyfriend?
Right.
No, no, wait. His flight doesn't leave for another forty-five more minutes.
The country.
Okay, but there is a wire back there! I mean that switch is connected to something!
Oh my God! Look at this!
Oh, we were playing "peek-a-boo." She just - she loves it when I'm dramatic.
What? What do you mean, "there you are"? Where was she?
You obviously haven't screwed over a lot of your friends. Which we all appreciate.
No. Is there anyway, anyway you think he'll understand this?
Chandler! Okay, let me get this straight, it's okay for you to flirt, but not for me.
See, I'm finding out all this stuff about you today, like you like the Law & Order and that you flirted with every guy in the Tri-State area!
Well, maybe she thought that with all of your history it could be, you know, implicit.
Unbelievable. She says goodbye to everyone but me.
First of all um, I love you both so much and you're both so important to me...
Me too!
Sandra, I am so sorry, I thought you were Rachel and we just weren't ready for you yet.
Well, my goodness, what was that?
Well, doing nothing on your thirtieth is better than doing something stupid, like Ross.
Nothing. I don't want to do anything.
I think his begging days are over now that he's going out with Nancy Branson.
Ugh! I cannot believe Chip dumped me for that slut Nancy Branson. I am never going out with him again. I don't care how much he begs!
That's a good idea! I bet they have one of those wind machines! Y'know...
Hey, why don't you guys go, get portraits done by a professional photographer.
I just-I can't believe that you think that you and Chandler know me and Rachel better than we know you.
I can check that for ya.
You're not dressed yet?! We're supposed to start having fun in 15 minutes!
Pheebs, I was wondering...
C'mon. Keeps his fingers to himself and he's always minty fresh.
I don't know.
I still say that if we had called your dad we coulda gotten better seats.
You're straight. I get it.
Nooo! No, that's not true. No, best time ever! Yeah, you rocked me world!
No. We were in the middle of sex...and you fell asleep.
Chinadolor Bong, come on, we steal that TV Guide every week!
What?!
Oh, wow, so you're gonna be one of those "healthy, healthy, healthy guys"?
You know those posters for the city free clinic?
Just go up to her and ask her out. Oh, what's the worst thing that could happen?
Ohh, she's pretty. Pretty ahh, pretty girl, the pretty--she's pretty.
They're in the kitchen getting something to eat. Can you believe how nice they are?
Where are Bill and Colleen?
This was fun! But I've got an invasive vaginal exam to get to!
What!?
So I don't have to sing and I can just sit there and pass judgments on others?
OK fine! Please come and support Mike. You don't have to sing.
I... I'm sorry, did you say something? I can't hear through all this damned hair!
He... he's gonna propose?
Mrs. Bing? Here, these are my parents umm, Judy and Jack Geller.
Oh honey! This is so exciting! I thought we screwed you up so bad this day would never come. Oh and just think. Soon there'll be lots of little Bings.
Oh, Rachel, sweetie, look, here's a really cute picture of Joey and you at the reception.
Pheebs! Always a pleasure.
Sorry. But I kind of have this feeling that we may have made a baby last night.
Here's an idea. You walk into a room...take a quick scan!
Oh my god! Did you hear that? She said Monica! Oooh, I can't leave her!
Yeah, okay.
Really? Cause I'd need like $500 for all the food and the supplies and stuff.
There you go, that's the spirit! Okay! Now, if you need money, I will lend you money, but just get moving!
Now see, this way you protect the plate.. and lets face it you have fun.
Hey. Amy. You've got to stop doing that. Monica about to have a heart attack: Okay, listen I know you're having a little bit of a family crisis, but you don't have to take it out on the plates. I mean, I mean in fact I think that everyone should cut their food like this.
See there you go. Woo! We're out of the woods. Okay, I'll get dressed now.
Definitely.
Well, I'm gonna fill in for him as food critic for the Chelsea Reporter.
Oh sure, Cilantro Larry.
Well, she was shocked when I told her, but then again so were most people.
Did she freak out?
Well, it was the first time. Y'know, there's not always a lot of agreement the first time.
It was fine, y'know? But she didn't agree with me as strongly as she agreed with Joey. She was more like, "I see you point, I'm all right with it."
Okay fine! Fine! Then you know what, I'll just write about Phyllis! Hmm!
Marcia and Chester.
Oh he's nice. He's nice! Y'know, you always stick up for the people we fog!
Dan just moved in downstairs. Yeah, he just got back from like this four-month trek in the Andes. Nice fella.
All right, y'know what? We really are late! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!!
This is my wedding.
Wait, no-no-no, I can go really fast! Dad, give me the keys to your Porsche!
Without my toe?! I need my toe!
Just breathe, breathe.. that's it. Just try to think of nice calm things...
Well, maybe that's my decision. Well, maybe I don't need your money. Wait!! Wait, I said maybe!!
Yeah, I've just been fiddling around in here making delicious treats for everyone.
Oh, yumm!
Okay, good, 'cause umm, well maybe we could have a little workout of our own...
Yeah.
All right. Tell me if this is too cute. Lesbian wedding, chicken breasts.
I'm uh, considering leaving your father.
What?! I didn't take care of everything, there's-there's plenty of things for you to do!
So wow, it looks like you took care of everything. Thanks a lot, co-host.
Oh yes, it is. I'm sorry I borrowed it, I was cold. I hope its okay?
Hey. That uh, that my sweatshirt?
Honey, you made the bed again. I told you, you don't have to do that. This isn't camp.
Well, I've never had it, I feel so left out. Oh look!
What? You freak! You wouldn't even have known about this place if it wasn't for me!
And now you'll see me buying it.
So look umm, while we're st-still in London, I mean, we can keep doing it right?
Bad London!
You, and you, you're supposed to be at my party. And Gunther! What are you doing here?
Could you guys please try to keep it down, we're trying to start a Boggle tournament.
I can't believe she's gonna say yes to David. She's clearly in love with Mike.
Ok, good night!
Yeah, and in the long version, I dump him for telling people the short version.
Well ah, the short version is, I ah pursued her for a couple of months, then I gave her a check for 20,000 dollars, and she was mine.
Oh hey Joey! We've been watching all day, when are you gonna be on TV?
Hey Mon!
Yeah with Chandler not getting paid, we could really use 300 million dollars.
Uh!
Yeah. All right, I'm gonna go tell Dan that it's not gonna happen. Don't do the dance.
Y'know, I sensed that I should stop. So we're okay?
Ok worse case scenario is...we borrow some money from my parents.
You know what? You know what? I think we're making too big a deal out of this. ok? So we pay our bills a little late this month and maybe next month we cut back on a few things. And maybe we start eating out of Joey's refrigerator for a change. You're chef... what can you make out of backing soda and beer?
Oh wait, just one more thing! One more minute! Umm, you're a stupid bitch.
Okay.
Okay, umm-umm, I'll just--I'll be right back, I just gotta go ah, go ah...
I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name. Paul, was it?
Phoebe knows and she's just trying to freak us out! That's the only explanation for it!
Are you serious?
Hi, come in! Paul, this is.. ... everybody, everybody, this is Paul.
What does that mean? Does he sell it, drink it, or just complain a lot?
Look, if you want you can keep it at our place until you find out what to do with it.
Well, they said would but they would only give me store credit. I mean, what am I going to do, get a thousand regular cats?
That's Mindy? Wow, she is pretty. Lucky. To have had a friend like you.
Mindy, my maid of. Oh!
We are the hottest! Huh? No one is hotter than we are! You're the best.
That was amazing.
I know being spit on is probably not what you need right now. Um... how long?
It's okay...
But Phoebe, you can go out with a creepy guy any night of the year. I know I do.
'Cause he was creepy, and mean, and a little frightening... alright, still, it's nice to have a date on Valentine's Day!
Yeah. I mean it was kinda fun for a while, but didn't you start feeling silly?
I hate my regular clothes now! Y'know? I look down and-and I know that this isn't gonna be the most special day of my life.
Olivia? I thought she was marrying Connor! Oh right, real life more important.
Olivia.
Yeah that, plus his mom used to put sour cream on everything!
Is that why in junior high you were the only one that hung out with that Ukrainian kid?
Really? Okay, so why don't you tell me what happened to Ross Junior year at Disneyland?
No I'm serious, we should tell each other everything. I do not have any secrets from you.
Don't worry Joe, I won't come next year! Joey: What have you got there?
Monica!
All right fine, your guy may have a great body, but our guy is really funny.
I know.
What Phoebe meant to say was umm, how come you're having a party and we're not invited?
Hormones!
It was okay. She's still kind of depressed because she broke up with her boyfriend.
Hey, how was your breakfast with Hillary?
Chandler there's nothing wrong with crying! I mean you don't have to be so macho all the time.
Yes it was very sad when the guy stopped drawing the deer!
No, Phoebe, I'll tell you what, if you get ready now I'll let you play it at the wedding.
I'm sorry, but I just wrote the best dance song for your wedding. Check this out.
No I'm not sure that it's the best way to hear everything. Someone get me a glass!
Yeah, you're right. This is none of our business.
Yeah I can! And don't think I don't, because I do! I mean all the time, you betcha!
Oh, it's so easy for you I mean, you're not married, you get to have sex with who ever you want!
Okay, we have a lot of options here, a number of prototypes for you to try on.
Yes! And please tell her to bring a cake!
No Chandler no! No unscheduled stops. You can go when we stop for gas.
Please!
I can't believe we've never done this before! It's sooo good! So good for Monica!
And, I want you to remember that I gave you twenty seven dollars. No strings attached. Now, if you can't remember that, I think we should write it down-let's write it down!
This is me in The Sound of Music. See the von Trapp kids?
We have got to start locking that door!
Rachel, say that I'm friends with her, we spend some time together. Is that so terrible?
Oh, I'm sorry, did my back hurt your knife?
Doesn't it ever just freak you out that-that you're never gonna be with anybody new again?
Kinda. They're really big.
Oh, honey!I can't. I was just telling these guys that things are crazy at the restaurant!
So, what do you say? Can you get out of work?
Okay, now that everything's wrapped up here, I think I'm, I'm gonna go do my laundry.
Maybe I should get another pair! Ooh, y'know, they-they had some with fringe all down the sides. I'm gonna go kiss Ben goodnight. I can't believe he thinks I'm a cowboy. I would make a good cowboy.
Guys! Guys! I just saw two people having sex in a car right outside.
Yeah, her first day on a new spiritual plane and she's gonna come to the coffeehouse!
That's okay, this is more important than fruit on my ceiling! You broke up?!
God, Monica it's on the ceiling.
Yeah, you really shouldn't. By the way, how was that year-long dig in Cairo?
Joey, you shouldn't lie on your resume.
Is it like for dinosaur emergencies. 'Help, come quick, they're still extinct.'
What the hell does a paleontologist need a beeper for?
Oh gosh, listen if you and Chip do it tonight, promise me you'll tell me everything.
I know!
I don't know how museums work in England but, here, you're not supposed to take stuff.
They were so ornate and beautiful, I mean look at that!
You can't fire me. I make your decisions and I say, "I'm not fired!" Ha!
Well, y'know what, no, you do not make my decisions because y'know what, you're fired.
Yes, because all good plans start with, "I'll go down the fire escape."
All right. I've got a plan. I'll go down the fire escape.
No, of course not. It's not even an issue. Cause I told him I was 22.
Whoa! And this manchild has no problem with how old you are?
He's got something plastic lodged in his throat, we've got to go to the hospital.
But you-you can't leave me with them! We-we're a team! We're playing a zone! They're gonna triple team me!
Oh, absolutely. Yeah, you know I'm not even thinking about that thing that we're not supposed to think about.
Oh, that's why you never see pigeons at sushi bars. See, we're having fun.
Yeah. I bet you can't guess what color my tonsils are? I'll bet the apartment!
What?
Remember that guy from cooking school I told you about that put cilantro with everything?
Oh yeah, I definitely know her.
Hey. Ross, did you know Mom and Dad are going to Puerto Rico for Thanksgiving?
Ok, ok, that's fine. Fine. Hey, I'm sorry about that spill before. Only $98.50 to go.
Jean-Claude Van Damme. I didn't know he was in this movie, he is so hot.
What what what what?
Well maybe we can make a, a, a 'B' out of one of those roses.
"Happy Birthday Peehe."
Yeah you will! The right guy is just around the corner! Okay, are we done with that?
Umm... I'm never gonna getting married!
Ok who thinks the food is delicious and a little pretention never hurt anyone?
Ok, well, who identified the tone of this restaurant as pretentious comma garlicky?
Ross let me ask you a question. All jokes aside, where is this relationship going?
I'm sorry, it's just one of my last nights together before she leaves for camp-to be a counselor!
Oh. I guess you can. Okay but; I-I have to return it, so you can't like it.
Well then why can't I see it?
It's supposed to be that small. It's a pre-appetizer. The French call it an amouz-bouche.
Ooh, you know, I had a grape about five hours ago, so I'd better split this with you.
Well, I-I-there was this guy at the bank that I thought was cute umm, but I don't anymore.
Nothing! You go!
That would be a terrible punishment. But, I'm serious, I've never seen these before.
Oh yeah, right! Good luck getting another scarf dance from me!
Wow! That Mike thing was interesting! I don't know what's gonna happen with Phoebe and David.
I wasn't gonna swim, I was gonna dig a hole!
A salad? Really I, I could do something a little more complicated if you like.
Alright, lets see if you're as good in person as you are on paper. Make me a salad.
Oh, really? So why was I busting my ass to make this delicious Thanksgiving dinner?
Hey, we all had better plans. This was nobody's first choice.
Look, I know that I should've told them. I know I shouldn't care what they think. I'm sorry.
Is this why they don't like me or why you don't like me?
Wow! That's great! Dad must really like you, he doesn't ask just anyone to play.
My dad wanted to know if you wanted to play racquetball with us.
This is crazy! I mean, it's such a stupid argument. I don't even wanna see Richard again.
Y'know Monica you had a minor setback in your relationship with Chandler. Big deal! It's only Chandler. I am so sorry.
Wait a minute. Are you honestly telling me that-that you may never want to get married?
If marriage worked, I'd be all for it. But do you know what the divorce rate in this country is? 97%.
What do you want me to do? Just sit here silently while you three have a conversation?
Yeah but, Mischa is so interested in you, that Sergei and I haven't been able to say two words to each other.
Well, you broke up with Julie Grath! How much weight could she have gained?
What?!
I think so. Se, he-he's not inviting you to his party because he likes you.
No, there's a party. There's a party. But the power, that is still up for grabs. You follow me?
Hold it! Are you talking about Dick Clark's New Year's Rocking Eve?
I just got a call to be a dancer on a television special for New Year's Eve. It's called some sort of Dick'n Rock'n Dickie Eve.
Because, you were mean to me and you, you teased me and you always, always got your way.
Why did you hate me?
Cowboy boots? I've never worn cowboy boots in my whole life!
Yeah, oh, but I just keep picturing you rolling around with him with your cowboy boots in the air...
Chandler, umm, I want you to take just a minute and I want you to think about how ridiculous this sounds.
No, the best reason to get married is pregnancy. Sorry is pretty much fourth y'know, behind being ready and actually wanting to get married. Will you be my wife?
He had to go, there's a deer just outside eating fruit from the orchard.
I've gotta go, there's a deer just outside eating fruit from the orchard!
I know. I just wish that once, I'd bring a guy home that they actually liked.
Listen. As someone who's seen more than her fair share of bad beef, I'll tell you: that is not such a terrible thing. I mean, they're your friends, they're just looking out after you.
I love you. Oh, wait, wait, wait! No hugs. The dresses... Oh what the hell.
Oh, thank you.
You know, I knew a girl in high school who did that. She was very popular.
Yeah, yeah, I'm going to be out there spreading joy to the people. I mean, last year, I spread a little joy but not really enough. So this year, I'm going to do the whole city.
The babies are asleep, I'm sure you'll be okay on your own for a while!
What?! No, you can't, you can't leave me here with them! We're baby-sitting!
But still, it's a big change. The end of an era, you might say!
Mon, honey you're not dying. I'm just moving out. Y'know, I mean we're gonna see each other all the time.
Yeah. Hey, that was nice of you guys to back off and let Joey get the girl for once.
Looks like Joey is doing allright with her.
Wait. Rachel, no, he's married. Married! If you don't realize that, I can't help you.
Whoa, wait, listen, I think I'm just gonna talk to Ross about what he think it meant.
Chandler, please! Do you know how unbelievably glad I am that Joey was not there that night?!
I don't believe it. The most romantic night of my life and I'm runner up.
No-no, I-I just, I liked them so much that I went out and bought some for myself.
Did-did you take these back?
Okay, ooh, alright. Name, address... Okay, in case of emergency, call?
Ow ow ow. Ow ow ow. Ow ow ow.
Honey, having a heart attack is nature's way of telling you to slow it down.
Most people don't like their jobs, I love my job! I have not been working for three hours and I'm already going crazy. I miss Joan.
Daddy! I don't think we need to hear about the specific positions you and mom had sex.
This one time I had my knee up on the sink and your mother, she was.
Yeah, but we haven't heard a thing from the adoption agency and it has been weeks!
Somebody is gonna pick us.
Well uh, you and I are just goofing around, I thought, why not goof around with him.
So, are you really gonna go out with that nurse man?
I'm not sick!! I don't get sick! Getting sick is for weaklings and for pansies!
I'm so sorry you're sick.
Ok, I don't wanna be negative so I'll say that most of the signs you bought are good.
This isn't the right room, sorry folks.
I said we are not going to do it, okay? Sometimes you can be such a, a big baby.
Willya relax? Look around. No pagan altars, no piles of bones in the corners, they're fine. Go like this.
Hey Gunther. Hi. I mean you're going out on a date with the noisy guy upstairs?
Hey guys.
I can't believe Joey's having lunch with his stalker. What i-, what is she like.
I know.
: maybe I will go yea will have a second honeymoon at the Tulsa romana.
oh why don't you fly out there and surprise him.
Yeah, sure... uhm, I'm devastated, obviously... Did you think the neighborhood was homey?
Monica, you understand what we are saying, right?
What is it with you people! I mean, the minute you start to feel something, you have to run away?
Men are unbelievable.
Wait a minute, are you doing Joey's "Audition didn't go so well. Yeah it did?"
Not so good.
Wow, you seem to be doing so much better. That's great. So how-how are things going?
Anyway, I just wanted to say thank you, it was just, it was so sweet.
Of course I have! What do you think, I'm some 30 year old virgin?
Monica. You've, you've done it right?
All right, you just make sure that Chandler catches the ball, I'll take care of the rest.
What are you gonna do?
Wow, really? One time he just looked at my bra and it popped open.
Well, it wasn't just me, alright? He freaked out too! He couldn't even undo my bra!
Oh because it doesn't...really fit. Oh by the way, I-I booked the Swing Kings.
Yeah, that's like the most ugliest dress I've ever seen. Wh-why do you to return it?
Oh, Chandler, that's sweet. But you don't have to do everything Doctor Phil tells you to do.
You know, you always cook this meal all by yourself. Let me help this year.
I'm sorry, okay? It just-tonight was supposed to be y'know, it was supposed to be a big deal.
Okay.
No you're not. You're, you're allergic to lobster and peanuts and--oh my god.
And that's what's gonna kill me. I'm allergic to kiwi.
Well that's it. People never say `We need to talk' unless it's something bad.
And?
Joey, I left my watch on the counter last night. It was right here, where is it?
Hi!
Phoebe, you got Joey drums to annoy Rachel, so she wouldn't wanna live there anymore?
Yes, thank you. You see, this is how normal people are supposed to react to drums.
Honey. Uh, not to sound too Florence Henderson but, dinner's on the table.
Nice moustache by the way. When puberty hits that thing's really gonna kick in.
I don't know! Why don't you just explain? What do they want? Find out what they want!
Oh god, waddawe do, waddawe do, waddawe do?
Then you'd be going back and forth all the time, I mean it doesn't make any sense.
Well, what if all my stuff was here?
That's right. My Mom doesn't have any faith in me! Oh, that's hilarious! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.
Oh honey, come on, have a sense of humour, you've never been able to laugh at yourself.
Ha,ha, ha, oh my life is just so amusing. Could we drop it now?
Oh, yeah.
You're so pathetic! Why can't you just accept it, we're winning because I'm better than you.
It's no surprise that your winning, 'cause you got to pick first, so you got the better team.
No! But, I'm throwing this shirt away! I think there was a little misunderstanding before.
Are you pregnant?!
Thank you! 2nd Customer: It was. The duck in particular was superb.
Everything was delicious!
Yeah, I'll be fine. You know, maybe I'll stay here and practice the art of seduction.
Really? You're gonna be okay?
Some people have been saying its y'know little drops of heaven, but whatever.
I told 'em your candy is absolutely indescribable!
Ooh! But the band and the photographer are coming all the way in from New Jersey!
The blizzard. I just saw on the news, it's like the worst snow storm in 20 years! They already closed all the bridges and tunnels.
Ah, it's an honest mistake. It could happen to anyone. All right, see ya.
Yeah, right Monica. I'm so sorry.
That is so sweet. I know that I was acting a little crazy but umm, I feel the same way.
Yeah! I've never been in a relationship that's lasted this long before. Y'know to get past the beginning and still be around each other all the time, I think that's pretty incredible. And the fact that this is happening all with you, yeah I think that's pretty exciting.
It's just that he doesn't have that much free time, ya know, and I don't know, what do I do?
Sure.
Wait, you can't have the baby here! I mean I haven't sterilised it since the guys moved out!
Yeah, I thought I had one a couple of minutes ago, and now I know that was definitely one.
Does it have to do with-with Chandler and that sock that he keeps by his bed?
No.
Wait, was this a-a small mediterranean guy with curiously intelligent good looks?
Yeah. This one goes across the street, I must have given him yours. Oh, bonehead, bonehead!
Hey, guess what I'm doing this weekend! I'm going to this culinary fair in New Jersey.
Wait! What about Joey?
Rachel, what's going on? I mean isn't this the same Barry who you left at the altar?
That's, that's nice twice!
Thank you so much for seeing us. Phoebe has told us such great things about you guys.
What?! You can't separate them! That's terrible. Which one?
What? So you guys don't mind going out with someone else who's going out with someone else?
No, of course not! ...Yeah, yeah, it is.
Phoebe! But I could take one of those little feet and put it in a pita pocket.
She's just so cute! I just wanna bite her ear off and use it and a sucking candy.
I'm so sorry that you had to find out this way. I'm sorry, but it's true, I love him too.
Look, we're not just messing around! I love her. Okay, I'm in love with her.
Wait. Rachel, no, he's married. Married! If you don't realise that, I can't help you.
Whoa, wait, listen, I think I'm just gonna talk to Ross about what he think it meant.
Thank you. So what does this Bob guy look like? Is he tall? Short?
There you go.
...And then we throw your body in the water... Gee, that does sound fun.
C'mon, you'll make a day of it! You'll rent a boat, pack a lunch...
Y'know what, I think we should play a game. I mean come on, it's been twelve years.
Anyway. That's when our Mom said we were not to play football ever again.
Oh my God, can you believe we are surrounded by all this? I can barely control myself.
Hey!
You heard the woman. Peel, chop, devil! I can't believe I lost 2 minutes.
We're back on.
Alright, I tell you what, I'll give this to you now if you can tell me where we keep the dustpan.
Ok, ok, ok, I will, I will, I, hey, I will clean the apartment for two months.
Well, no, not at all, you're not terminal, you just, you just need some damage control.
So, you don't think I'm terminal?
So do you guys gonna come over tomorrow? I'll make that pasta thing I was telling you about.
And Chandler I can't believe I let you pay for this one. Thanks man.
Hey, look at me. I'm making jam, been at it since 4 o'clock this morning.
See Joe, that's why your parents told you not to jump on the bed.
With a wok? I thought you were going to read my boring book to put you asleep.
Shhhhhhhhh!!! I'm sorry, I thought maybe I'd make some warm milk and it would help me sleep.
Why would I care where Chandler is? You know uhh...You know sometimes I don't even like Chandler.
Pisst, Monica. Alright, we really need to start looking out for Rachel. I'll cover the front door. You watch that big hole at the back of the building and I got Chandler covering Ross.
So! So we've got to go upstairs and have a lot of sex to prove them wrong!
Ohh, so?
Okay. That's okay. I-I know that you're very upset right now. I know, I know that wasn't about me.
Oh my God!
Here's your key. All right, you have to christen it! Now, go out and come back in!
Oh thanks.
Are you insane? I mean Joey, is going to kill you, he's actually going to kill you dead.
You see what men do! Don't tell me men are not nice! This is men!!
Well, because every time we do, you make jokes about swinging and scare them away.
Yeah, I don't know why we hang out with married couples more often.
Oh, the way you crushed Mike at ping pong was such a turn-on.You wanna...?
What? Homo ergaster: Some scientists classify some African erectus specimens as belonging to a separate species, Homo ergaster, which differs from the Asian H. erectus fossils in some details of the skull .
He's not great umm, but he's dealing with it. Oh wait a minute, you're not gonna try...
How's Ross doing? Y'know since all the Emily stuff.
What's the big deal with her? Maybe she's attractive in an obvious kind of way.
I wasn't staring. I was leering.
He wanted to tell me he's gonna compete is some ultimate fighting competition thingy.
Well then definately don't take his name.
My God, Rachel, I can't believe Phoebe made out with Ralph Lauren. Ohh, I'm so jealous.
I am proud of all my friends today.
Really? I'm perfectly comfortable. Hey, hey, hey, get in line buddy, I was next.
Monica, Monica, your guest are turning into jerky, OK.
I can't get married until I get something old, something new, something borrowed, and something blue.
Right!
Oh, I'm glad. Listen, I want to apologize about Chandler, though. I just did not see this coming.
Thanks so much for taking me to all those places. I had a great time.
Oh yeah? Well when you learned how to dance did you forget how to put on underpants?
We learned how to dance.
All right people listen, I've got exactly twenty-eight minutes before I have to baste again.
Okay. All right. So let's see, let's play from the trash can, to the lightpost. Right. Two hand touch, we'll kick off.
Yeah, I talked to you on the phone, I'm the lady that got stuck with the racecar bed.
Uh, may I help you?
Well uh, I'm trying to make something for Joey. Do you mind if I raid your fridge?
Hey! What's up Mon?
Ok, um so, I still have to invite Dillon and Emma and Shannon Cooper.
I talked to Rachel's sisters, neither of them can come.
Oh, I've got it! I have got it! Pictures from your childhood. This will get you going good!
Cry?! I just found a talking puppy, I'm rich!
I would love too, but I can't! I mean I just can't, you know that I'm not good at confrontation.
Well, wait a minute, you're the boss! Why don't you just yell at them? Or, fire them?
We were, we were just in the storage area and we saw this really creepy man!
You guys! You guys!
Well, honey, it is pretty competitive. I mean I've got an actual rocket scientist here.
Noooo, that's what I was wearing when I donated. I'm kinda surprised there's any of my boys left.
Whatever Ross! Just replace the bulbs in the brake lights after you're done.
It's a car Monica! Not a rocket ship!
That's what it says here. Flight 421, leaves at 8:40, Newark airport.
Yes, that's what I have. It's not on the board.
Y'know, I don't have an appointment, but I sure could use a physical. Are you sure you're okay?
I bet he can.
Joey is having a secret Days Of Our Lives party up on the roof!
Wh-what's going on?
Y'know what, this is obviously some kind of twisted joke she's trying to play on him.
Ugh!
Joey, what are you doing? You promised Phoebe you wouldn't eat meat until she has the babies!
The next tour of the wine cellar will plan in two in-in minutes...
Yeah, but the important thing to know about us, is how much we would care for this little baby.
Well, our names really are Monica and Chandler. We're from New York.
Oh man! If I had known I was coming to this party I never would have gotten married!
Ok actually Mon, Matthew was just giving me his phone number.
Wow, come in, have a seat. You must be exhausted coming all the way from...Texas.
Santa was unavailable so close to Christmas.
Alright, before I tell you, uh, why don't you tell me how many women you've been with.
Night Richard. Good luck Mon.
Well, are you asleep right now, Joe? 'Cause I don't think you have to wear it unless you are!
Oh, they gave it to me at the sleep clinic, and it's gonna help me not to snore.
Yeah, y'know I-I made a commitment to you. Y'know what, it'd be, it'd be fun.
Really?! Are you sure?
My brother, the PhD would like to know if there's any way to treat this orally.
Did you tell him about my thquirt gun idea?
See? Ben doesn't think you're a loser, he thinks you're a cowboy! Now that's something.
Oh, be-because of the leather pants.
I know what you need, you need a bodyguard. Hey Ross, what is Ben doing after preschool?
Hey, it's a lot harder than it looks! Okay? She-she-she's hurting me.
No. Big deal, so you have a side of the bed, everybody has a side of the bed.
Or so I would have you believe.
Well uh, you and I are just goofing around, I thought, why not just goof around with him.
So, are you really gonna go out with that nurse man?
How about if I dance around all covered in sauce? Huh? You think it's funny now?
No.
Y'know if it's any consolation, he really did sound like he was having more fun with you.
Honey, I'm sorry.
Did you like her? And I'm just asking as a friend, because I am totally fine with this.
Oh, that was the blind date that I told you about, she called and switched it to today.
Okay. I'm guessing that if you don't want to deliver, you probably don't want to pick stuff up either.
No.
I-It's just so insulting! Big spring for a new blank tape, Doctor!
Is that a problem?
Oh Joey, look, we know you're having a hard time with this, but we really, we love it here.
Maybe. Well, I just think you guys can do better than this house, you know? Or any other house for that matter.
I know, but now we have this second one and it just, it feels like it's snowballing, y'know?
But we've only had one job.
No, I know. But y'know what? It would make me feel better if Lewis apologized to me.
What? Are you kidding? That was like 16 years ago.
Ugh, y'know, umm we gotta get up early and catch that plane for New York.
Actually, do you guys mind staying here for a while?
This is a garden view room, and we paid for an ocean view room.
What? Why?
Oh no it's not, no it's not. It's a first date. I'm sure that nothing is gonna...
Oh, this is just terrible.
Phoebe! I have to have those earrings, we're going to leave as soon as the show is over.
Doesn't know, "Hello." But she knows Capricorn One.
Can I ask you guys a question? D'you ever think that Alan is maybe.. sometimes..
Yep, we sure showed those Hassidic jewellers a thing or two about softball..
Okay, so it doesn't involve Ross or Rachel or Chandler or Joey. But, what about Pete?
No.
Well, if you had kept listening, you-you would have heard me call him Mr. Big......ot.
Well, I wouldn't know because I got so freaked out that I hung up the phone.
Because, honey, I mean this in the sweetest way possible, nobody is gonna wanna watch that.
I have a weird feeling about this place. How do I know that they are not gonna secretly videotape me and put it all over the internet.
Wait-wait, guys! If-if we follow the rules, it's still fun and it means something!
Fun's over!
Well you let me know if you can, because y'know I can bake a pie to cover it.
What the smell from Joey's? No, I can hardly smell it over here.
Man, man that is sharp. It must have cost you quite a few debloons.
No no, no no, it's not flashy, not for a Goodfella.
Well, I did one time, and-and I want to start doing it more. See that's what this is about.
Not really.
Oh, that's Nana, right there in the middle. 'Me and the gang at Java Joe's'.
Got me.
Um, you guys, you know when I said before, "thank you, but I don't really need your help"?
No, that was his costume. See, he's actually an orthodontist, but he came as a regular dentist.
Listen, we don't have to make that a guest room, we can think of something to do with the room together.
Ohh.
All right ah, Ross, this is the extent of my knowledge on the subject. Call Rachel.
Oh what?! Is she gonna cancel on me again?! How can she do this? Doesn't she know it's our anniversary?
Okay, listen, there's still some of Chandler's medicine under the sink in the bathroom. Bye!
Look, uh, just come later, we'll get everything squared away and you can come back later.
Ross, come sign this birthday card for dad. Rich is gonna be here any minute.
No, sorry I don't. Tell me why would anyone pay someone to scar their body for life? What if it doesn't come out right Phoebe? Then it's like, I don't know, havin' a bad hair cut all the time. Why's everyone staring at me?
I'm on top of the world, looking down on creation and the only explanation I can find...
What? Ow!
: what's the big deal, you forgot, she forgot, maybe you were having an off night.
and who's fault is that.
If someone wants to give us a present, we don't want to deprive them of that joy.
That's okay Pheebs, we're not having a party or anything, so you don't have to get us...
Yeah... ..see, I was supposed to get married, but, um, I left the guy at the altar.
Thanks! I've been here about six years, and Rachel moved in a few months ago.
I know, I've been looking at those doors, they look pretty sound proof, don't you think?
We have to leave for New York in an hour.
I can't do it. I'm sorry, I wish I could, but umm, see you have these feelings for me....
Oh no, not the thing. I hate the thing. What's the thing?
I don't know, maybe. I mean I'm dating a man who's pool I once peed in.
Yeah. Are we nuts here?
Hey! Oh, I'm so glad you're home, I thought tonight we could finally organize these photos!
Hey!
No, there is no way! It can not be Ross! Unbelievable! Why is your family Scottish?!
Yes!!
You know, that's true. You'd be a great person to have around the day after an emergency.
My diary! My diary, that's brilliant. I should have told her it was my diary, she never would have made me read her my diary.
Could you guys please try to keep it down, we're trying to start a Boggle tournament.
Everything you've heard is true.
No, I want you to have a job that you love. Not statistical analysis and data reconfiguration.
Yeah, me too. Look, I'll just get my old job back.
Ok, let's see... uhm, okay, the turkey is in the oven, the stuffing is ready...
"The Firm"?
No. Um, I know you like this, and I want you to have it. I think it'll look good in our apartment.
What you got there? Something else that's not yours that you can break?
My Sweet Sixteen! Remember, you went to third base with my cousin Charlie.
Monica, what are you talking about?
Oh-ho! But not in here! Can't eat 'em in bed, remember? No crumbies!
Okay.
Well that's because you always sleep to noon, silly! This is what 9 looks like.
But it's dark out.
Hey, don't say that! You got just as good a chance as anybody else of getting that job!
Well no, Charlie's gonna get that.
Oh, I'm sorry. Of course I mean that. Interesting idea, umm, talk about it, but no.
Okay so you mean no as in, "Gee Chandler, what an interesting idea. Let's discuss it before we reject it completely."
Hey Ross, maybe if your skin was lighter. Your teeth wouldn't look so bright.
I don't know what I'm going to do. That date starts in like an hour.
We got out pictures back from London. Here's all of us at the Tower of London.
Hey, Pheebs!
But the minute we start to lie to each other... And by 'we' I mean society.
Well, maybe he just didn't want to hurt your feelings.
I don't, I just, I just like the smell of them. So, uh, what are you really doing here Dad?
Well, it's your mother's bridge night so I thought that I would come into the city for a little Monicuddle. Since when did you start smoking cigars?
Oh my God! Ross, you wouldn't believe the cute little noises the twins are making. Listen.
What? Hey, hey, listen..
Let's just do it right now. Okay? It won't be hard. Just say what's in your heart.
Do you happen to know what I'm going to say?
So you're a little older. Try to look at the positive: You have all this life experience.
I am so much older than these other interns. I can't compete with them.
Oh my God! We love that show! I mean Ross and I have been watching it since I can remember!
Yeah, that's what I said.
Okay, fine I admit it! I feel terrible! Would you please rub this on my chest?
Really? Struck down in the pribe of libe!
Oh, that's great! I mean I'm-I'm sorry, but I'm so happy for you. And now I can work for you!
Her name's Ann, she's a journalist. Ahh, we met on the plane. She asked me if she could finish off my peanuts, I thought she said something else, we had a big laugh. Yeah, I just, I mean I got, I got tired of waiting.
So how does this work, you going to balance the plates on these little guys' heads?
I know!
Mom and dad just sent me in here to find out if you were trying to get Ross stoned!
I don't know, I-I was all high.
Wait a minute. That wasn't a hard eight! Last night I rolled a hard eight.
That was so unlikely. Well, let's get married! I guess.
No! Wait! If anybody gets to go.. it's us We've been complaining the longest!
Well, if you're leaving, I'm definitely gonna go.
It's almost 8 o'clock, it's almost past his bedtime. Where-where is he?
Because, because I've got Ben.
Get all freaked out because everybody was talking and just joking around about marriage and stuff.
What?!
Oh. Thank you. Ohhh, thank you very much. Oh, thank you for coming. Uh, just a second!
Does she use the cups? Yes! I believe she does. Does she use the plates? Yes! I believe she does.
My brother's going through that right now, he's such a mess. How did you get through it?
I know, I know, I'm such an idiot. I guess I should have caught on when she started going to the dentist four and five times a week. I mean, how clean can teeth get?
Guys, could you please just stop throwing the ball for one minute and just help me find it!
How do you know? You don't have a watch.
So how you doing today? Did you sleep okay? Talk to Barry? I can't stop smiling.
You should both know, that he's a dead man. Oh, Chandler?
They love each other, and they wanna celebrate that love with the people that are close with them.
I am really not going. I don't get it. They already live together, why do they need to get married?
Maybe because it's you hung your head out of the window like a dog the whole ride here.
Okay. Then I guess I have dry eyes and a scratchy throat for no reason.
Okay, he's a lawyer, who teaches sculpting on the side. And- he can dance!
Yeah, but did you see the dents in his knuckles? That means he's artistic.
Well, an-anyway, I just-that night meant a lot to me, I guess I'm just trying to say thanks.
Right.
Okay, I've got a question. If you had to pick one of us to date, who would it be?
You see, now, I would date this girl. She's cute, she's outdoorsy, you know, and she knows how to build a fire. I mean, that's got to come in handy
I cant believe you. You still havent told that girl she doesnt have a job yet?
Yeah.
Wasn't it a lot more exciting when we were y'know all over each other all the time?
Oh wow! Is that what this all have been about?
Nope, sound like me. Pheebs, it's going great. Look at Chandler with little baby girl Chandler.
I'm doing okay. I think it's going well. Do you think they're having fun? Am I talking to fast?
It's a stupid game and I wasn't playing against other people, so technically I didn't lose.
Now, that's a lot harder than it sounds. You always forget at least one, or in some cases... fourteen .
Yeah-Oh that's right. You, you always wanted me too. Hey, I see you got your mustache back.
You too, you let uh, your hair grow long.
And say what? "You owe me a goodbye", I mean, he's got more pride than that.
Ross, if you're this upset, you should go and talk to her.
Is-is-is that message old or new? Old or new?! Old or new?!
"Monica, it's Richard. Call me."
This is for the scratchy twins out there. I taped oven mits to their hands.
Ooh, duct tape. Was I supposed to bring something too?
So big deal, so Joey's had a lot of girlfriends, it doesn't mean he's great in bed.
Yes, and I was saying the actual words.
Well, this is the last box of your clothes. I'm just gonna label it, "What were you thinking?"
Hey, I didn't make up the rules. Now, after you receive the doubling bonus, you get uh, one card. Now that one card could be worth $100 bringing your total to 1,500. Don't get to excited because that's not gonna happen unless you get-No way!
Do I go horseback riding in the park? Do I take classes at the New School?
Oh, it's so late for 'Shall we'...
The woman that got married a bunch of times and killed herself when you were 13?
Yes!
I can't wait to be with you! I'll just tell Rachel I'm gonna be doing laundry for a couple of hours.
All right! Man, this is unbelievable!
Well, if I had them taken out, then I wouldn't be able to do this. You like that, right?
So if you want people to see them, then by definition you're not having them taken out... say, at the break of dawn?
Am I doing here? Why? Surprised to see me? Ross brought me. How do you like that?!
Monica! What...
Hello! Organic substances recently discovered in the depths of the rain forest!
God. Do think it really doesn't hurt? 'Cause how can they do that?
That's weird. I've had the same number of beers as you and I don't feel anything at all.
I am sooo drunk.
I think it's a great idea. Yeah, we could have a dinner party and just invite her close friends.
Yeah but if we throw her a party on her birthday, then it's not a surprise.
Wow, for a guy who's recently lost his job, you're in an awfully good mood.
Fine, make fun. I think it's jaunty.
Okay. Okay, I got one. Do you remember that vegetarian pate that I made that you loved so much?
Whoah, boy, hockey was a big mistake! There was a whole bunch of stuff we could've done tonight!
Well Ross, you be careful now. You don't want to get a reputation as y'know Professor McNailshisstudents.
Well, not really. I mean technically it's-it's not against the rules or anything, but it is frowned upon. Especially by that professor we ran into last night, Judgey von Holierthanthou.
You're supposed to find your passion in life. You can be whatever you wanna be now. It's exciting.
I mean, what am I supposed to do with myself?
You do know that was me who just said that right? Hey. As long as we're both up...
Yeah! You?
Remember back in freshman year? Well, Billy Dreskin and I had sex on your bed.
Would you excuse me for a second?
Well, I'm sorry, but Chandler and I could really use a weekend away. You know, to reconnect... emotionally.
C'mon you guys, this is really important to us.
Alright, well, maybe I should let you and the second prettiest girl in Oklahoma get back to work.
Well, she... she didn't win...
Yes. Yes, I was. A guy. From work. I'm seeing a guy from work! Ha!
Since when do take naps in that position. Oh God Monica, tell me you were waiting for a guy! Please tell me you were waiting for a guy!
Hold on a second, just put a little club soda on it and it should umm, be.....
Yeah.
What you guys don't understand is, for us, kissing is as important as any part of it.
Okay, so, I'm in Las Vegas... I'm Liza Minelli-
Oh, you can have an accent and I can't?! Top 'O the morning to ya laddies!
Right, will you excuse us for one moment? What are you doing?
Yeah, well I might be if I had the supplies! I mean, I could do all this stuff. Only I don't.
You're not an artist.
Yeah but it was because I-I had an eye exam and I don't like my new eye doctor.
Oh really?
Look, I don't even know how I feel about him yet. Just give me a chance to figure that out.
What are you talking about? We love Schhteve! Schhteve was schhexy!.. Sorry.
Especially the after taste, you know, I'll tell ya, that'll last ya till Christmas.
Really?
Yeah, tacos! Ever since you told me that story I've had such a craving for them.
Oh yeah?
No! Everything's cold. The turkey's dried out and the... the stuffing is all soggy.
Alright, come on... Alright, you guys. We're so sorry we're late. Please let us in, so we can have dinner together.
Oh, he's sober alright. Just turns out that Fun Bobby was fun for a reason.
What, isn't he sober?
Um, okay, here it goes. I'm not 22. I'm, I'm 25... and thirteen months.
Oh.
Rachel, I have not missed one question the whole game. I own this game! Look at my hand.
Monica, betting the apartment, I don't know about this.
Y'know, in my defense, umm there was no glitter on the macaroni and very little glue.
I'm back baby! Ha-ha-ha!
Come on Chandler, come on, I can handle Ross. Hold on! Hey Ross. What's up bro?
Oh, I'm going on the lamb.
Sounds like you need to think about what you want, talk to Gavin, and you definitely should talk to Ross.
I don't know. It's so complicated. I work with this guy, you know, I have the baby, and I have Ross, and I just...I don'tknow what to do and I have to be at the office and see Gavin in ten minutes.
I just tell her, I have to get it over with. I told Ross and Phoebe and she's the only one left!
What gave me away?
Oh, I guess we could try that, but... it seems so harsh! Have you ever done that?
Cut her out of our lives! Just ignore her calls and dodge her 'till she gets the point!
Well, I was dancing around, and singing "No Woman, No Cry" and I got stuck.
Really? What happened?
Umm, when I said that uh, that Chandler and I wanted to umm, live together we meant alone together.
Um-hmm.
Okay, just wait, please. I promise we'll come up with something. Just give us a little more time.
Well, get ready to come out of the non-gay closet!
Why not! This is her wedding day, this is way more important than some stupid kids!
I don't think you can do that!
No, I don't even know how serious he is about me. Until I do, I'm not telling them anything.
No, I think you should tell them.
And for our two-week anniversary, he's gonna take me to his cousin's cabin for the weekend.
Half full of looooovvvvve.
I was just saying that because I was ovulating and you said you wouldn't have sex with me while we're fighting.
Leave it.
Come on. Hello? I'm sorry you have the wrong number. Okay, I'll call you later dad. I love you.
If that is your father calling to tell this story then the marriage is off!
Mom's here? I wanted to have lunch with her today, she told me she was out of town.
N-no, Emma dropped her sock.
Oh my God. You guys! You gotta come see this! There's some creep out there with a telescope!
I don't know, you don't wanna mess with corn nuts. They're craaazy.
Look, guys, you can't do this, it's just going to make getting over each other, that much harder.
Oh! Sorry, I guess I was thrown off by the mention of my name!
When I fall asleep on the couch after reading, she covers me over with a blanket.
That's nice. I like having things to read in the bathroom.
Come on Rach, come on. Let's see what's it like to be on a winning team for a change.
I can not believe your trading me!!
Rachel, you can go down there, you don't have to smoke. Just say you wanna get some fresh air.
I mean what if this keeps happening? Y'know, they'll-they'll be outside smoking, making all the decisions and I'll just be up in my office breathing my stupid clean air, y'know? And then when the day comes when Kim wants to promote one of us, who do you think she's gonna pick? Me or Smokey Smokerson?
Okay, those people just left, come on! Quick! Give him the money and get their table!
Mustached bastard...
Well, the turkey's burnt. Potatoes are ruined, potatoes are ruined, potatoes are ruined.
Ok, Monica, only dogs can hear you now, so, look, the door's open. Here we go.
I'm so sorry that you had to find out this way. I'm sorry, but iit-t's true, I love him too.
Look, we're not just messing around! I love her. Okay, I'm in love with her.
Honey, thanks for trying to figure out a way, but if you're going to Tulsa, I wanna go with you.
That's fast math! We could use you in Tulsa.
Well...honestly ever since we got engaged I have been waiting for something to, to flip you out.
What?
Yeah, but her plane got delayed in Athens. But actually, she should be here by now.
Isn't Rachel supposed to be back by now?
Phoebe and Rachel saw you with Nancy today and... em... they think you're having an affair.
Is it me, or have the greetings gone downhill around here?
Perhaps, you would like me to turn like this, so that you can bunny bump against my back.
Well, let's go to a bad one and make out.
We should get over there and see if she's okay. Just one...second! Score! Game! Come on.
I think she took it pretty well. You know Paolo's over there right now, so...
I can't believe it! She's asleep! I got her to go to sleep! I have actual magical powers!
You must be a fireball in bed.
Phoebe! You're sick, you shouldn't play. You should just go home, get in bed, and stay there.
Hey!
Yes it is. You see I've always found the men's bathroom very sexual. Haven't you?
Monica! This is the Men's room! Isn't it?
Chandler, you don't wanna miss this. This is the birth of your child! It's the miracle of life!
I'm okay.
Chandler, wait. It goes: Old job, new job, you. This is just something I have to do.
Okay, bye-bye! Good trip!
That's crazy! . I am sorry. I just can't imagine giving up my one wedding day like that!
No, no, no, we're not having a big reception, we took the money we were gonna spend on a wedding and we donate them to the children charity.
Hello...? Oh hi... Oh my God...! Really...? I can't wait to tell Chandler... Ok, goodbye.
No!
Because your all gonna make up fake specials and make me cook them like you did the other night?
Because we can remember them.
Oh, um, that was my bathing suit from high school. I was uh, a little bigger then.
Hey, Mon, what is this?
Well, at least you're not hearing it for the first time at your fifth grade Halloween party.
What a sweet story.
Ok! When I go places with high humidity, it gets a little extra body, ok?!
Alright, I don't wanna alarm anybody, but Monica's hair is twice as big as it was when we landed!
Okay, but all right you're a guy, does it not freak you that you're never gonna sleep with anybody else?
No. No, see when I first meet somebody it's uh it's mostly panic, anxiety, and a great deal of sweating.
Umm, why don't you give me something that would be a good reason and-and then I'll tell you if it's true.
What? What are you talking about?! You-you're the one who's been telling me to get over Ross and move on. I'm moving on, and you're moving on with me. Come on, give me one good reason why you don't wanna go.
Unless... Maybe we do it here. I mean, how much can she even be aware of at this age?
Sorry.
Oh come on, it's only fair, you paid for the flight. Now is, is that enough lire?
You're, hey, you're not paying for the pizza!
Oh, hi, Ross. Yeah. There's someone I want you to say hi to. He just happened to call.
This is so fun. This is like a reunion in the hall.
Hi sweetie, look before I forget, did I leave my diaphram at your place? Hi mom.
OK.
Y'know what we should do? We should all get dressed up and go to have champagne at The Plaza.
Yeah, you're on your own.
You're right. I mean I'm sorry. Yeah, I shouldn't be laughing. I should be laying down papers for you!
Look, okay-okay I had food poisoning! It's not like I choose to do it! It's not like-It's not like I said, "Umm, what would make this ride more fun?!"
Oh, I love this street. The trees, the big front yards, the actual picket fences.
Ross, you know what? Okay, let's talk about it later, there comes security.
Oh my God, that place has the creamiest frosting! I use to hitchhike there when I was a kid.
Oh, you're gonna love this cake. I got it from a bakery in New Jersey, Corino's.
Wow! Wow! And it's definitely all gone? There's nothing there to work with? What were you thinking?
That's right.
Honey, as we get closer to the wedding, is there anything that you would like to talk about or share?
Y-y-yeah! Yeah you do.
And Dad, y'know that mailman that you got fired? He didn't steal your Playboys! Ross did!
It was you?
So, do you guys wanna come and eat dinner at the restaurant sometime in the next few weeks?
Hi!
Now, most guys will hit uh, 1-2-3 and then go to 7 and set up camp.
Well, y'know, sometimes that helps.
: Is this not the good part? Do you want me to fast forward to something a little toothier.
Honey why am I watching a bunch of sharks swimming around.
Yeah but see I have nothing to compare it too. So even if you're horrible, how would I know?
Yeah! If-if-if we did do this there would be a lot of pressure on me, y'know? Because you've been waiting a very long time and I wouldn't want to disappoint you.
So I hide in the shower and the next thing you know they're going at it right on the bathroom floor.
And-and then I sneak out and before Monica can her parents come in.
How she drove you crazy, picking on every little detail, like your hair... for example.
Tell her what?
It was Laura... She gave us a great report and we are officially on the waiting list.
Wrong number?
Y'know what shoes would look great with this ring? Diamond shoes! You're not getting dressed.
I was afraid of that.
All right. But umm, I-I-I'll pay you back all the money you invested, and you can keep the van.
You're the cook! With out you it's just me driving up to people's houses with empty trays and asking for money!
No you didn't. Oh and honey just so you know, now that you're marrying me, you don't get to win anymore.
Y'know we already went over this and I won!
Hey, waitwait, aren't you the guy that plays the butt in the new Al Pacino movie?
Hey!
In one year?! My God what did she eat? Her-her family! That's not the point.
A hundred and forty-five pounds.
Wait a minute, you got Ross Gellar and guest?! I wasn't invited and you got "and guest?!"
Yeah, Joan Tedeski my date. She's an assistant professor in the Linguistics department. Tall, very beautiful, and despite what some people say, not broad backed!
They can't all be bad. Find the one where you make your bedroom eyes. Ohh, there it is.
I like this one. It seems to say, "I love you and that's why I have to kill you."
Ok. Great. I am so glad that you are here. We're really excited about getting this process started.
Oh, water would be fine.
It was, it was really nice. We started talking and I-I ended up having lunch with him.
Oh! Okay, that actually makes more sense. So how was it?
Thank you! You haven't said anything... 3rd Customer: Actually I do have one small complaint.
Thank you! 2nd Customer: It was. The duck in particular was superb.
I will! But not tonight. For dinner music, I thought we could listen to that tape you made me.
Look, you have done enough! Okay? You have to stop this now.
Oh my God. Wait a minute, I had them put... Oh my God! It's in the quiche! Oh My God!
Oh, no, I meant that it's weird that you only have nine now.
Oh umm, how about your mom dying, or having to live on the streets when you were 14?
So, I need to write some depressing stuff to go along with my new floozy voice, but nothing that sad has ever really happened to me.
We think if you saw it, you'd understand. I mean you guys were there. It is beautiful, isn't it?
You know that's not the reason Joe.
Yeah, well he's my brother! And plus he drives so slow he could never hurt it.
Wait a minute! You let Ross drive the Porsche and when I ask you, you say you're the only one who's allowed to drive it.
David, can you help me?! I'm trying to explain to Chandler how a plane stays in the air.
You don't own a TV? What's all your furniture pointed at??
Okay, I'll be back in just a minute. Oh, Phoebe I'm sorry that I left lipstick marks on the phone.
Cute naked guy is really starting to put on weight.
Ok, I'll tell you what. How about I cook dinner at my place? I'll make it just like Mom's.
Well, you were right. How can they do this to us, huh? It's Thanksgiving.
So uh, Joey and Chanlder, I, I think it's time that you take Dr. Greene over to your place.
Ok, now that your coat is safely in the bedr-, oh, ok we can come back out in the living room.
I can't believe you're dressing up for him. I mean, you're just, you're setting yourself up all over again.
No, no the gravel capades. Yeah, the turns aren't as fast but when Snoopy falls. . . funny.
All right! Let's go! Let's go Team Monica! All right, we can work out the name later.
I am!
They baked it. I can't take this anymore. I'm gonna call a meeting tonight, I'm gonna fire you tonight.
Hey, what happened to your fancy chef's jacket?
Okay, guys! The candy is coming; I just need another 15 minutes for the chocolate to cool!
Get in here! Hey, and you can not smoke in here! Merry Christmas.
We're supposed to uh, be spending a romantic weekend together, it-it, what is the matter with you?
Do not speak ill of the dead.
Wow, so you guys are, you're never gonna be in the same room together? How is that even gonna work?
Well look, I'm just trying to focus on the "I get to see my wife," part, all right? And not the part that makes me do this.
I don't believe this! When someone asks you in for lemonade, and to you that means they wanna have sex?
Oh right, right.
Oh, it was great! The widow wouldn't pay, so Phoebe yelled at her 'til she did.
Thank you! Hey, how'd the catering go?
2 minutes, 12 pies and a part of one tin! Okay, I see you guys at 4.
Did you at least win the contest?
So what! As long as he's not wearing a white dress and a veil I don't care.
Trust me, you don't want him there either. Okay? Nobody is gonna be staring at the bride when the father of the groom is wearing a back-less dress.
I hope you're hungry, we're starting with oysters. And y'know what they say about oysters, don't you?
Yeah, it sure is!
: Honey look we can do something else, do you want me to get into the tub and thrash.
does what always have to be sharks.
A Magic Eight ball?! You can't be serious, you can't make this decision with a toy!
Okay, that's it. I cannot make this decision! It is too difficult, so I'm just gonna leave it entirely to the gods of fate.
I think he is fine! It's just that we don't know anything real about him... we should get more information.
You don't like him.
Come on guys! Suck it up! We're closing in on ten hours! It's gut-check time!
I'm starving!
You know, they're not actually supposed to have... I'll work on the lumps. Joey, you're going home, right?
Will you make the mashed potatoes with the lumps?
Are you kidding?! I get a Porsche and the barca lounger's gone?! This is the best day ever!
Oh yeah, Joey broke it. Had to get rid of it.
Oh, what about that guy over there? Remember? That is the guy you flirted with at the counter that time.
Yeah, I guess Gunther is kinda...
Now I'm guessing that he bought her the big pipe organ, and she's really not happy about it.
Ooh, I was kinda hoping that wouldn't be an issue...
Oh absolutely. I like it even more on you than I did on Colonel Sanders. Ross! Ross! I'm kidding!
You like it right?
Umhmm, umhmm, about the time you told me about New Year's Eve. Where is everybody else?
It is. Did I... not tell you about her?
That was not an incident! I-I was gesturing, a-and the plate slipped out of my hand.
Oh, I beg to differ. The Pictionary incident?
Okay, look, I-I have enough stuff for one more sandwich, I mean I was going to eat it myself, but
Just a sandwich? Look, I am 30 years old, I'm about to be divorced twice and I just got evicted! That sandwich was the only good thing going on in my life! Someone ate the only good thing going on in my life!
Hi, good morning lover. I gotta say after last night, I'm a little weak in the knees.
Oh, yeah. But you have to give it back if I get a job. Of course, by that time in the future ties will be obsolete and we'll all be wearing silver jump suits.
Yeah. I think you have to draw him out. And then- when you do- he's a preppy animal.
Yeah?
No, it was Ginger. I remember, because when he told me, I said, 'the movie star.'
Nooo. No, no, ah, are you sure it wasn't something that sounded like Ginger, like ah, Gingeer?
She's just upset because she, uh, she buttered a spider into her toast this morning.
I, OK....
So, Mr. Rastatter, what exactly does this job entail? The ad wasn't too clear.
This is a nice resume. Nice, nice, nice. Muy impressivo.
Oh my God! That's great! Oh wow! You're a published writer! I wish I had a present for you!
Who sold a story to Archie Comics?!
What about all the guys that you've got the phone numbers from? Why don't you just kiss one of them?
Well hello !
Hey, Rach. How was it with your friends? Okay! How would you like some Tiki Death Punch?
Well. Your mom didn't tell us about the blobbies.
Wow, this is so weird. I just realized this might be the last time we'll all be hanging out together.
Oh God, I really missed that fat bastard!
Um, I straightened out your shower curtain so you won't get mildew. What? To me that's nice.
Yes, I was going to incorporate that. Oh good, here's Monica, she'll have something nice to say.
If it makes anybody feel better, then we can just forget the thing, and we'll just do the gift.
Basically, there's the thing, and then there's the stuff after the thing.
You know what would be real weird? Is if you weren't there. Just say you'll think about it, okay?
This isn't one of those uh, y'know "If she doesn't come, we-we don't, we don't come?" Right? Because I already bought my ticket...
Just out. Had some lunch, just me, little quality time with me. Thanks for your jacket.
They took Ben to the park. Where've you been?
I just checked my messages, and he said that when he gets back from Atlanta, we need to talk.
What?!
All right!! All right. I got stung. Stung bad. I couldn't stand. I-I couldn't walk.
Well, we have to say something! We have to get it out! It's eating me alive!! Monica got stung by a jellyfish.
Oh, I'm sorry honey, you know, but when she said "sex" I wasn't thinking about "sex with you"!
Seriously, answer faster!
Sweetie, with you it's gonna be different. The sex is gonna be great, 'cause you-you guys are in love.
We share a wall! So either he's great in bed, or she just likes to agree with him a lot.
Oh yeah, I got soap and sponges and rags and Carnuba wax and polishing compound.
The ones that got me the Porsche! Will you keep up! But I figured, if-if people keep seeing me just standing there, they're gonna start to think that I don't own it. So I figured I'll wash it. Right? Monica, you got a bucket and some soap I can borrow?
Can we turn the TV off? Okay? Do we really want to spend the entire weekend like this?
Nothing! It's over! Dammit! This is regularly scheduled programming!
Hey, it is unreasonable to expect a child to wait for a light bulb to cook brownies!
Yeah, not as much as you used to love to play uncooked batter eater.
Rach, you're in a great place in your life. Come on, you've got a great job! Good friends...
And now Chandler! We're all gettin' so old! Why are you doing this to us?!
Look at us all dressed up for the big office party! By the way, what are we celebrating?
Anybody gonna eat that?
Limited seating! Oh, that is such a lame excuse! That's not the reason she's not inviting me!
Well yeah, but she doesn't know that. I mean, the last time she saw you-you would've turned one of those little wedding chairs into kindling.
Well if Ted Kopel talked about his coworkers botched boob jobs, I would.
Well, maybe sometimes I find out things or I hear something and I pass that information on y'know kinda like a public service, it doesn't mean I'm a gossip. I mean, would you call Ted Kopel a gossip?
So I made snacks. Please, just hang out okay? I'm just gonna rest my eyes just a little bit.
Oh yeah!
Yeah, they were just slowing me down. Alright, I have to get back to the babies. I'll see you girls later.
Yeah, you didn't even use the tools for most of it!
Oh y'know what? If you're gonna be acting like this all night, I really, I don't even want to be around you.
That's so funny, because I think I just did!
Come on! Tests make us all better learners! Oh yeah! We should have essay questions!!
A test?!!
Joey! This is not like learning to ride a horse! This is like learning to...grow a turtleneck!
I don't know! I really want this part! And they tell you no matter what you get asked at an audition you say yes. Like if-if they want you to ride a horse, you tell 'em you can! And just figure out how to do it later.
So if everyone liked it, and you liked it, that would make this a success. Which would make you...
I thought it was... quite tasty.
All right. I know you're not happy about us moving, but you're the only one who hasn't seen the house.
No, thank you.
Alright. If you guys don't want it to be special, fine. You can throw any kind of party you want.
Yeah, I agree. Ya know, I think fancy parties are only fun if you're fancy on the inside and I'm just not sure we are.
Whoa! Whoa!! Tackled by a girl! Bet ya don't see that everyday, do ya?
Hi.
Of course there's another guy!! This is even more perfect! Now you have to prove your love!
Well...
I couldn't eat it! I had five friends who couldn't eat it, and one of them eats books.
I want a retraction! Our food is not inedible swill!
You bet that I'd screw up?! So all that stuff about hiring me because I was good was...
Um-hmm.
All right then, when I'm done with this place, it's gonna be ten times better than that place!
Yeah, that's true.
Alright, you know, we got it, we got it. Let's play for real. High stakes... big bucks...
OK, so at this point, the dealer...
Well, she corned me! She asked if the wedding was in town! I mean, what was I supposed to do?!
You said no right?!
No, it's okay, not only did I get to go out with Chip Matthews, I got to dump Chip Matthews.
Oh honey, I'm sorry.
Here, I got it. I'll will play my message for you guys, and you can tell me if it's breezy enough.
Well, how could it not be breezy, no, 'cause, you're, you're in such a breezy place.
You guys haven't gotten your presents yet? Tomorrow's Christmas Eve, what're ya gonna do?
Yeah, what're you guys doin' here, aren't you supposed to be Christmas shopping?
I am going... I'm going--Turn it over! I'm... I am going to get these drops in your eyes.
What are you? Monica!! Stop it!! Oh my God! Stop it!
Alright, but I'm very excited about this OK, so you gotta promise you won't get all big-brothery and judgmental.
Come on, tell me.
Really. Well, at least 'big girls' don't pee in their pants in seventh grade!
Hello? Like he was really gonna send you one? She was a big girl.
Didn't you listen to the story? I mean, this is twisted! How could you get involved with a woman like this?
What 'not work out'? I'm seeing her again on Thursday. Didn't you listen to the story?
Okay, if Joey does the ceremony, then we have to find someone else to walk Phoebe down the isle.
I had to read the Bible pretty carefully, but... yeah we do.
You know it's funny, the last time Paulo was here, my hair was so much shorter and cuter.
Are you sure he's gonna be able to crack that code?
Okay. I gotta call Michelle. I gotta see if that was her voice or not. I'm sorry, I just have to.
Thank you!
I'm so sorry, I can't believe I did this, but I couldn't stop laughing at your Norman Mailer story.
Yeah. I'm thinking, if we put our heads together, between the two of us, we can break them up.
: yea well the weird part is... he was getting off to a shark attack show!
Oh that couldn't have been pretty. but you know guys do that.
Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- -I'd want yours.
Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done.
Yeah... Yeah, I know it's pretty selfish, but haha, hey, that's me. Why don't you try the hummus?
Really?
Look, all we're trying to say is, don't let what happened with Carol ruin what you got with Emily.
This is not fun!
Ugh, we're screwed, aren't we? You know what? Just tell me on the way to the bird store.
Hello, this is Chandler Bing. Somebody just dropped off a handwritten recommendation letter, and.. Uh-huh... Uh-huh... okay... thank you. Good-bye. .
And he came at us with an axe, so Rachel had to use a bug bomb on him!
It was like this crazy-eyed, hairy beast man! He was like a, like a bigfoot or a yeti or something!
Y'know, I only know of two surefire ways to shut a man up. And one of them is sex.
Like a little girl. I know. I know. I know. This is all my fault; I wanted him to open up. But God, I didn't know that I was gonna unleash this-this weepy, clingy, moist monster!
Well, I was thinking, that you gave the guys such great haircuts, I thought, maybe you'd like to do mine?
All right, so what were you thinking?
You know what? It seems like you've been making an awful lot of stuff Irish lately.
Yeah, we're gonna... we're gonna get some cake.
Mmm, looking good. Ok, cider's mulling, turkey's turking, yams are yamming. What?
Tonight, on a very special Blossom.
It will be my pleasure. My guy has diplomatic coupons. Your guy can't even say coupons.
I have just resigned my post. Would you care to accompany me to the Rainbow Room? I have diplomatic coupons.
Oh, I wish there was a job where I could wear this all the time. Maybe someday, there will be.
Y'know, I gotta tell ya, this really does put in a better mood.
All right, I'll go down there. But, I'm not gonna serve the lasagna. I'm gonna serve something I make.
Okay, umm, if a kid gets straight A's, his parents would say, "Yeah, he pulled a Monica." Y'know? Or a fireman saves a baby, and they go, "Yeah I know, he pulled a Monica." Or someone hits a homerun and the announcer says, "Yeah, that one's outta here." Though some things don't change.
Because it would totally freak him out and tomorrow's our anniversary. I just don't want anything to spoil that.
Ooh! So now why can't we tell Chandler?
All right... you're right. We're sorry. Now let's wake up Emma and get the fun time started!
Look, I know that you guys really want to get to Vermont and this isn't a really big deal to you, but it really is to us, ok? Emma will never have a first birthday again.
Hello? It's Joey. I'm so glad you called! Chandler told me what happened. Y'know he's really upset about it.
Ooh that is definitely Chandler, Joey, or Ross. Or-or Rachel!
No! No it's not! It's not gonna be okay! It sucks! No swing band! No lilies!
Honey, it's gonna be okay.
Okay, I've had it with the hair jokes. Tomorrow morning, before we leave, I'm going to the salon.
That's not true. I came with Monica and I'm leaving with Weird Al.
I have no moves. Okay, whatcha doin' there?! Oh y'know what? I'm sorry, this is just too weird.
I have some moves.
Ohh, this is soo amazing! I can't believe my brother's getting married! And in London! It's so romantic!
Yeah.
Pheebs, you've been up for 24 hours! Go to sleep, honey. Th-this isn't healthy.
Please stay on the line. You're call is very important to us.
And then Chandler was, was really sweet and he consoled me. And well we drank too much...
Oh.
Hey, hey, look. Look Ross, Ben drew a picture of you! Huh? You're-you're a cowboy!
Look at me!
Oh, well, I bought Chandler a five hundred dollar watch and he wrote me a rap song.
I doubt that! Tell her about us last year.
All right, there's some pizza at my place, we can all eat with one hand right? Are you with me?
I'm still hungry!
Please? Please?! We just don't want to deal with telling everyone, okay? Just promise you won't tell.
No-no-no-no-no! You can't!
No. It was painful. Oh my God , they should call it Pain-zine, now with a little wax.
Was it not pain-free?
No, to get a table! Places like are always shakin' you down. Everybody wants to be paid off.
Give him money? It was a joke!
What are you talking about? She obviously lives on the second floor, seventh apartment from the left!
Because it's impossible to find her apartment! She lives in some like of hot girl parallel universe, or something.
Okay, now Thanksgiving's over, let's get ready for Christmas. Who wants to go get a Christmas tree?!
No, it wasn't. It was actually the...
Oh, then bring it on! Oh, unless of course your afraid you might lose to a bunch of girls.
What?! The guys against the girls? See, that's ridiculous Monica, because I'm only down by three touchdowns.
How many perfectly fine women are you gonna reject over the most superficial insignificant things?
I'm tellin' you, she leaned back, I could see her brain.
That's right. That's right. And that is why you can't stay here tonight. And probably why you shouldn't come to the wedding.
Say again?
Nothin', nothin', hey you're a cheapasaurus. I'm kidding, I'm kidding, thank you, I'm very greatful.
Yeah, yeah I mean, you get your money and you learn a little something, what's wrong with that?
Look, doctor! Look, before we sign anything we really have to talk... We're not who you think we are.
Yeah. It's a sonogram they took of the baby last week. I thought you might want to see it.
Bouncy baby, Bouncy baby, Ooh baby baby, Ooh baby baby, Ooh baby baby.
I have to go scream into a pillow.
: Here why don't you sit down, get yourself comfortable because I. have a little surprise for you.
oh it was great.
Okay. But wait, we can't. My Cousin Cassie is in the guest room, we're supposed to have lunch.
That's me! Come on!
Well, uh y'know, our guy works with Chandler and he's really nice and smart and he's a great dresser!
A chin dimple!
What we did was wrong. Oh god, I just had sex with somebody that wasn't alive during the Bicentennial.
Ok...ay.
Ok, let's see... Oh, the cranberry sauce, it is easy to make and no-one really cares about it.
I'm serious, let me do something, just not the turkey or the stuffing, nothing "high profile".
-but that wouldn't be fair to me, it wouldn't be fair to Alan- It wouldn't be fair to you!
Okay!
But getting over was the hardest thing that I've ever had to do. And I never let myself think about you.
Ahh.
Oh, you mean like that guy thing where you act mean and distant until you get us to break up with you.
I know, that, that's why I don't want to go tonight, I'm afraid I'm going to say something stupid.
Can you believe it? ...Y'know what? I just don't feel the thing. I mean, they feel the thing, I don't feel the thing.
Waitwait.. we talking about the coyotes here? All right, a cow got through!
Hello, this is Monica... Yeah??? Oh... Okay, yes, we'll be right, we'll be right down. Thank you.
Okay no, you do it.
And then we're gonna have a little Middle Eastern cous-cous. Something we can eat, with our hands.
So oysters, huh?
Chandler, I'm unemployed and in dire need of a project. Ya wanna work out? I can remake you.
No, not wieght... y'know, more like insulation.
Look , I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have.
She's already fluffed that pillow... Monica, you know, you've already fluffed that- -but, it's fine!
Y'know when girls sleep with guys with weird things on their body, they tell their friends about it.
Thank you, but I want to remove it Pheebs. I don't want to make it savory.
Rachel, if you want the little round waffles, you gotta have to wait until I find the little waffle iron.
Ohh, whoa God! Storage rooms give me the creeps! Monica, come on please hurry up honey! Please?
Oh, I don't know. Maybe, um, "That was nice?" Admit something to me? "I'll call you?"
Well, what do you want me to say?
Really? Wow, well then come on, I wanna show you how to fold the toilet paper into a point.
Actually, if it's possible, I love you more.
Okay, I'm gonna go check on something across the hall. You start by washing these Not with soap!!
Tell me more.
Oops! Y'know, your birthday is in a month-and-a-half, what do you say I forget to get you a present for that too?
Wow! You are way to young to have seen that!
Ohhh! What are you doing to me?! Oh look, I-I... I'm sorry but umm, this-this-this-this is not going to happen.
Working with blind kids.
She picked Rachel. I mean, she tried to back out of it, but it was obvious. She picked Rachel.
Maybe I could be a waiter. Could I use the phone?
All right, so I haven't cleared the budget with my parents yet, but tell me how this is for music.
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm so rude. Does anyone want to come to the movies?
Yeah.. uh, but for future reference, that thing in your hand can also be used as a phone.
Can I use your phone?
You better believe he's tired, after the day we had! If you know what I mean. You know what I mean?
You tired Chandler?
It's beautiful! It's like the first bathroom floor there ever was. Whoa! Are you going in there for?
Yeah! Hey, do Monica and Rachel work there?
Oh! Why didn't you tell me? I made him his own individual sweet potato stuffed pumpkin.
Oh, right. Sorry. But Tag's not coming; his girlfriend came into town, so he's spending Thanksgiving with her.
Ok listen, you go down to the pool and reserve the chairs, and I'll get the magazines and the lotion.
Hey! Remember when I had corneas?
All right everybody! Everybody guess what? I just convinced Paul to give us a test next week!
I don't know! I didn't come with her!
No no. See, in my bedroom I set my clock six minutes fast. You wanna know why?
Well, I'm confused. I thought we shared time.
The muscles from Brussels, wham bam Van Damme, did you see Time Cop?
Ya think?
Really well. Yeah. Surprisingly well. Yeah, she didn't cry. She wasn't angry or sad.
Oh yeah? Well, how'd she take it?
Umm, so how long have you been working with your dad? Come on, one of us had to mention him.
If that helps you.
Well, umm, Walker was looking for this big bus load of kids.... All right, I get your point.
Monica, last Saturday night, what happened on Walker Texas Ranger?
Oh my God! You own an Italian restaurant and you think that tastes good?! Where are you even from?
Hey! I'm proud of that sauce, it's delicious.
Ross! That is so sweet of you to get Phoebe that bike! When I heard the story, I almost cried.
Well, it gets worse. When asked if you take initiative I wrote, "Yes, he was able to unhook my bra with minimal supervision," and under Problems with Performance I wrote, "Dear God, I hope not," and then uh, then I drew a little smiley face, and then a small pornographic sketch.
Phoebe! Rachel! It's Monica! I wonder what you could possibly need me for on such short notice! Oh.
Say something clever! Okay, doesn't have to be clever, it just has to be words. Say some words. Any words will do. Oh my God! This is the longest that anyone has not talked ever! There is nothing you can say to make this worse!! So just say something!! I-I, I uh haven't had sex in a very long time. Yeah, you really shouldn't have said anything.
Oh my God. Okay, go into the bathroom, use whatever you want, just don't ever tell me what you did in there.
Whaddya think? Today's the big day!
Phoebe, relax none of that stuff ever happens! They just put it on there for legal reasons!
Oh my God! Dizziness, nervousness, drowsiness, facial swelling, nausea, headache-Headache. Vomiting, stomach bleeding, liver damage! Now okay, I don't recall any of this coming up when you gave me these little death capsules! Oh I'm sorry, extra strength death capsules!
Doctor, can I see you for just a minute please? My brother has a slight phobia about needles.
Hello, there. I'm Dr. Carlin. I see someone's having an allergic reaction.
Okay, how about the fact that he's engaged to another woman, who just happens to be your ex-best friend?
I have my reasons.
Hi. We're buying the house next door, and we were wondering if we could just take a look around.
Yeeeah!
You have nothing! You're not even going out! You're her baby sitter! You have a 12-year-old girl's job!
You see Amanda and I have a very special...
No-no-no, that's a video-phone. But hey guys you're not supposed to be here, so please, do not touch anything.
Whoa! For a rich guy he's got, that's a pretty small TV.
Drunk enough that I know I wanna do this. Not so drunk that you should feel guilty about taking advantage.
How drunk are you?
Behind my brother's back? ... is exactly the kind of crazy thing you won't be hearing from me.
C'mon up.
No. No you can't go. No this is fun. Come on we're just getting started. Here, here's your marker.
I um, was sorta thinking about maybe...
Okay, come on, I can't get married until I get something old, something new, something borrowed, and something blue.
Oh, okay.
Would you look at them. Am I ever gonna find a boyfriend again? I gonna die an old maid.
Hey, Bonnie had sex there!
Wait a minute...Joey. Joey you can't ask her out, she's your roommate. It-it'll be way too complicated.
Ugh, I cannot wait to ask her out!
Oh, I know. I know. Hey, you know, you can take it if you want! The lease is still in Nana's name.
Oh man, I can't believe you guys are leaving this place.
You gotta go home and get the earrings that you borrowed from me okay? Chandler wants me to wear them tonight.
But I like it here!
No honey. You have to sleep on this side of the bed because I have to sleep on this side of the bed.
Yeah. I have to sleep, have to, on this side of the bed.
Okay. Umm, y'know, I don't think, I don't think I told you this, but umm, I just got out of a really serious relationship.
Just tell me the truth.
Come on! Surprise her! Show up at her doorstep! Don't let her go without a fight!
Really?
Okay, so, uh, we're in France, we're making the toast. Do you see a little bassinet in the corner?
Well, uh, sometimes I think about selling my practice, we could move to France, make French toast.
Wow, all you need now is The Killing Fields and some guacamole and you've got yourself a part-ay.
Ok, Love Story, Brian's Song, and Terms of Endearment.
Wow! You might just get the first Nobel prize in rubbing. So what country is this guy from?
Oh!! That's my new thing. I figure bodies at peace, make peace.
Phoebe, it's not what you wear. It's sort of your songs... I just don't think you should play at the restaurant anymore.
Right, yeah, ok, I'll ask the butler to fetch my diamonds out of the vault.
I'm gonna hang this basket on the door and when the neighbors walk by they can all take a piece.
I'm sorry, who?
That's Paul's watch. You just put it back where you found it. Oh boy. Alright. Goodnight, everybody.
Hey Mon, look what I just found on the floor. What?
Y'know, I-I-I don't think that I can. So if you don't mind, maybe this will be it for me on the work things.
Oh, you get used to it.
But either way... You're gonna get married, you're gonna be happy, my mom's gonna like you better than me.
I suppose it wouldn't be the end of the world... Oh, thank you!
Really! All right? Let's forget about this going home stuff and celebrate our anniversary. Okay, this is empty.
Really?!
uh huh.. I mean these things happen. Its' just a plate. Its not like somebody died.
Are you okay Mon?
Hand me those tomatoes, I'm gonna show you what it should taste like! Come on, hand me them.
Lebanon.
Alright, I'll tell you what. I'll come get you in 5 minutes with some sort of um, kabob emergency.
See.
Really, Rachel, I was thinking of you the whole time. Look, I'm sorry, all right. I never meant for you to find out!
Yeah, right. Sure!
Oh really, you want to talk about quality? Have you heard of a key? It's what some people sing in.
Well...it's not about quality.
Phoebe is going to say "Yes" to David. See, that's what happens when you meddle in people's lives!
Oooh! I hope you're happy too, honey!
No. It disappears back there behind that baseboard. For a minute there, I thought it went downstairs.
And did you?!
Oh, Phoebe, she couldn't stop crying! With those thick glasses, her tears looked giant.
But Mon, you have to get our money!
Oh, no! I mean, obviously we want to see you take your clothes off! You big piece of eye candy!
Are you talking about me?
What if I have babies, okay? I mean I'm gonna look different. I'm okay with that, but I'm not sure that you are!
You were not supposed to hear that! I said that behind you back!
What am I gonna do?! That is the dress! That is the dress! Wh...Chandler wants the band. What do I do?
Does that mean Carcass is available?
Ya know, Roy saw Star Wars 317 times. His name was in the paper.
Oh my God, look there's Roy Gublik.
Joey, put that down! Oh my God! It's Pete. Okay, get out!! How the hell do you answer a video-phone!
Look at this! A millionaire's checkbook.
"Take me to the mansion in the sky-y". I am sorry, the song is over. Did you see me out there?
Oh, not with my combination of ice cubes, aloe Vera and my gentle self-loathing touch.
Now Joey, you go down there and you suck up to him. I mean you suck like you've never sucked before!
That's not true!
You know that's nice, y'know we could put it back there after the surgeons remove it from your colon!
Eh! There you go.
Come on Chandler, come on! It'll give us great practice for when--people with babies come to visit.
Yeah, I'm gonna pass. 'Cause I was kinda iffy when it was puppies.
It is in the living room where there is also a light! And no one will kick you in the shin.
Sorry, I just...can't sleep. Ooh! Where is that book that you are reading with the two women who were ice-skating and wearing, wearing those hats with the flowers on it? Because every time I look at that cover I'm like...
Oh! Ohhhhh! Oh! Phoebe, come here. Aw, this is my new bed. You gotta feel this bad boy.
Hi. Y'know in England this car would be on the other side of the store. Woo!
That's mine!! Now, would you both please start acting like adults? And get me my cough drops!
Hey, so he stole a couple bucks from me! At least he bought me something with it!
Drunk enough to know that I want to do this. Not so drunk that you should feel guilty about taking advantage.
How drunk are you?
Look at me! My big concern is what's real?! Oh my God. We're really sad, aren't we?
I'm not gonna right to you! That's not real!
Hey, I just whipped us up some Easy Bake treats, they should be ready in about three days.
Hey.
I gotta make up the guest bedroom. Hey, Cousin Cassie is coming to stay with us a few days.
Sure.
Well, it's the thought. Hey, doesn't Ross's flight get in in a couple hours? At gate 27-B?
From you. I exchanged the blouse you got me.
Look what I got! Look what I got! Look what I got! Can you believe they make these for little people?
Oh, I chose not to hear that.
Hey, you better hope that we're pregnant, because one way or another, we're giving a baby back to Rachel.
Okay.
I'll get it. Hello. Hi Emily! Yeah, uh you-you tracked him down. Hold on one second.
It's almost as if he knew.
Oh now that-that-that's funny, it seems like Chandler's conference could've been in Connecticut or Vermont.
Oh weird, Chandler just told us he's got a conference there!
Okay, is this like 'I have an early class tomorrow' or 'I'm secretly married to a goat?'
Uuh, before we get into any staying-over-stuff, there is something you should know.
Ok, the first person's most embarassing memory is, 'Monica, your party sucks.' Very funny.
All righty roo. What a great moment to say that for the first time.
I am not 'so'! OK, I was a teensy bit weird at first, but... I'll be good. I promise.
Monica, nothing has even happened yet, and you're already so...
All right, look, I hate this as much as you, but if it makes you feel better, it's all your fault.
Noooo.
I know. But umm, one time there was this really dirty car in front of the building, so I washed it.
You don't even have a car!
You know, on the way over here, I saw this drunk guy throw up. And then a pigeon ate it!
I've missed you too.
Um, well, I was going to, I-I-I really was. But um, then somewhere, just out of nowhere, I didn't.
Why haven't you told them?!
: Hey Rach its me ok I just got the Chandler's room and I caught him molesting himself.
Hello.
But I figured, you know, that shouldn't change anything. I mean, what the hell does it matter how old we are.
Huh!
Nice work everybody! So much for the y'know, "You can drive it, but don't tell Rachel" plan!
I've never driven it! Okay? Not once! Okay once. Okay, I drive it all the time.
Now we just have to wait for a call and... and someone tells us there's a baby waiting for us. Oh...
That's great!
For your information, ass munch, I've lost four pounds. Maybe even five with all the dancing.
Soo... you girls having fun?
No, no! We should divide them up and I should get extra because we used my card to buy them!
Oh, you guys! We've got to keep all the tickets together.
Well, maybe you should send him something. So that when he gets to Las Vegas he'll know that you're sorry.
Y'know, he won't even talk to me. How am I going to apologize to him if he won't even talk to me?
No Joey! Chandler could be your assistant! See, he could answer all of your fan mail and stuff!
That's an idea! Hey, if I hired an assistant, would-would you take money from her?
No, it doesn't, does it? But you wanted lumps, Ross? Well, here you go, buddy, ya got one.
Here we come, walkin' down thethis doesn't smell like Mom's.
Alright, for the bizillionth time, yes I see other women in shower at the gym, and no I don't look.
Oh, hey, Monica, we've got a question.
Well I think the length of teasing is directly related to how insane you were so, a long time.
Okay, how long is this going to go on.
Come here. I'll make you feel like one of the guys. You know for a really cool guy, you suck at foosball.
Yeah, just, I feel like I'm about a hundred. I thought I was just one of the guys.
All right, fine. Tonight's potatoes will be both mashed with lumps, and in the form of tots.
But my mom always makes them. It's like a tradition. You get a little piece of turkey on your fork, a little cranberry sauce, and a tot! It's bad enough I can't be with my family because of my disease.
No! Wait! I think I can figure out the recipe from this cookie! I do stuff like this at work all the time.
'Cause it's gross.
Alright, well, this does not change anything. Okay, we need to get something to grease the sides of his face.
Alright, hurry up, you gotta do something.
What?! You can't shed a tear for your dead wife!! Now, I left you a note from the beyond!
What?!
My god, if I had a nickel for every guy I wish I hadn't..., but this is about your horrible mistake.
People do stupid things when they're upset.
What is the matter with you?! Do you want to fall into the trap? Do you want to fall into the trap?!
Yeah.
So the wedding caterer sent me this list of twelve appetizers and I have to narrow it down to six.
Oh, it's like huge weight has been lifted! 'Cause look, no hair loss, not a rash, no hives, I'm just so happy! Because no shortness of breath, no temporary euphoria-Oh.
This is so bizarre. I guess it kinda makes sense though, y'know she had such a terrible childhood.
Wow! I mean, I just-I can't, I can't believe this. Y'know, I mean you think you know someone even, even Phoebe who's always been somewhat of a question mark.
Yeah! All right, maybe you don't have to smile. Let's try something else. Let's try umm, try looking sexy.
I do?
Oh my God, sit down! Sit down! How long as it been since we've seen each other?
Hi!
Oh! Oh my God! That is the most beautiful top of a head I have ever seen! Chandler, you have to see this!
The baby's head is crowning.
Ow! Oh, that sounds nice! I am just there for jury duty. They really spruce that place up!
City Hall.
Well, spring vacation is doing nice things with your grandparents. Spring break you're doing frat guys.
What's-what's the difference?
Oh, just some pictures I made and hung up. I thought they'd brighten up the place. They do don't you think?
What-what are-what are these?
MEG was good for me but I dumped her. Ya know, my motto is get out before they go down.
What happened to uh, MEG.?
Ugh, I can not believe this! I mean, who is she to judge us? We could not have been nicer to her!
So she was just pretending to have a good time last night? She was lying to our faces?!
Oh sure, now you're Mister Sensitivity. But when you wanted to have sex right after my uncle's funeral.
Look, I can't do this. I can't make luv to you while we're fighting this way.
Well, every, every Thanksgiving um, we used to have a touch football game called the 'Geller Bowl.'
Yeah.
Because! She's my cousin. I mean, we grew up together! We're family y'know? Well that's important to me.
Bec-Did you not hear me?! She's an assistant professor in the Linguistics department, okay? They're wild! Why do you want to come anyway?
Oh, you must be freezing. You know what you need? How about a nice steaming cup of hot Mockolate?
I am, uh, I am...
So Nancy told me about this job at this great restaurant, Javo . It's just a little outside of Tulsa.
What?
Well sure! I'm just wearing sweats! But that's good that you're not in love with me, because you just want a girlfriend!
Well there you have it!
It says "Do it!". And behold she did adopt onto them a baby. And it was good.
Reverend, can I ask? Does the bible say anything about adoption?
We were on the platform, ready to dance the world into the new Millennium, and the guy yelled 'CUT!'
Uh, yeah, okay. Except I sorta felt like I needed a couple of seconds to get ready.
Wow, isn't it ironic that David would show up on the same day that you and Mike exchange keys?
I know! Evil! And... and... and... I like Mike so much, you know. It's just going really well. Oh my God!
I'm sorry, okay. It's just that Chandler has somebody, and Phoebe has somebody- I thought I'd ask Fun Bobby.
So tell me something. What does the phrase 'no date pact' mean to you?
We're going to Las Vegas to see your dad. It's time you two talked, and I want to get to know my father-in-law.
Are you serious?! I mean like eloping?! No more stupid wedding stuff?! No more these flowers or these flowers or these flowers-Think of the money we'll save!! We're not eloping. I love the flowers. Can our wedding be bigger please?
Yeah, you're my husband. I'm not gonna live in a different state than you for 208 days out of the year.
Really?
It is nothing like the Hobbit. It's like reading about every relationship I've ever had, except for Richard.
Well that sounds kinda cool, kinda like The Hobbit.
Ross, but me down for another box of the mint treasures, okay. Where, where are the mint treasures?
I spelled out boobies.
Did you just hung up on me? All right, look, I need you at the rehearsal dinner tonight at 1800 hours.
Well, I don't care, so you pick!
Believe me, Chandler and I have not seen each other in over a week. We'll probably be the first ones there.
Ohh. Oh wait! you guys won't be late for my dinner, will you?
No. If you thought this mess is going to bother me, you are wrong! All right, let's go Blinky! Chandler!!!!
All right! Let's get this over with! Ugh! Ohhh! No! Look what I did! Oh, I mean, look at this mess! I mean, we're probably gonna have to clean this up! Y'know? We're gonna have to reschedule!
God! Look at all these tickets! It's so exciting! You know I haven't won anything since the sixth grade.
What's that now? Opening credits.
Okay, just stay there a couple more hours and if she doesn't show up by then, then just come on home.
About four hours.
Oh, well don't take it to the same place you took the stereo, 'cause they've had that thing for over a week.
I'm just taking it to be re-wired.
Damnit! Y'know this whole time we were concentrating on watching the babies and, and no one was watching Chandler!
Well, I was trying to prove that I was right. Y'know? And it turns out I was wrong. And now it's lodged in my throat.
You're the most incredible woman I've ever met. How can I lose you? Now, I don't actually have a ring...
Alright, but after this I want to see you outside. If the rain stops.
Well, that's different. My lie didn't make one of us a felon in 48 states. What were you thinking?
Well, you never told me how old you were.
All right, it'll be great! You just make her think you wanna have sex with her! It'll totally freak her out!
And Joey, get me a bottle of wine and glasses?
Two guys in one night? Wow, I thought she became a slut after she got her nose fixed.
You kissed her that night too?
Yeah and you better watch the flirting too, cause you know, in such close quarters, it could be trouble.
Oh, Oh, you're right! I don't want that. I can't date her!
Alright, lets say that it is him, would we not want the baby? No! Would we treat him any differently?
Honey, it's us. Of course it's the shovel-killer.
Sorry! I'm just-I'm not very good at this! I'm a terrible liar and I hate having to lie to Rachel!
All right, so you're telling me that I have to tell racist jokes now?!
Have you lost your mind? Chandler, this isn't about me! This is about you and all your weird relationship commitment crap!
Oh please, you are obsessed with babies and-and marriage and everything that's related to babies and-and marriage! I've got an idea, why don't we turn down the heat on this pressure cooker?!
Well, my financially challenged friends, I split my money and I bought some shares of CHP and ZXY.
How did you make $17.
Rachel would be Phoebe's, I would be Rachel's, that way we all get to do it once and no one would get upset.
Uh-hmm.
No, it just remind me of something this guy did today at work. I told you about that funny guy, Geoffrey, right?
What's with the word y'all? You know, just... two words just... pushed together... Are we all allowed to do that, because if so, I say why stop there? You know, your new poodle could be your noodle. And fried chicken? Could be fricken.Waiter, waiter excuse me, I'll have the fricken? See, that's... that's funny with the fricken, right?
Y'know what, don't tell us. We'll just wait until Chandler gets home, because it'll be more fun that way.
What, oh, oh, oh, no, no, I can't, I can't tell you that, it's like the most awful, horrible thing I've ever done my whole life.
Y'know, it is so strange seeing Ross here this time of day, 'cause usually he's got the children's hospital.
Okay umm, why don't we all take a seat, y'know? And uh, and I'll get us all some uh some coffees--Yeah, why don't you. Uh and you guys can talk about whatever, whatever you want. Y'know? Whatever pops into your head.
I mean, you're the one they're gonna come to when they wanna run away from home, and the one they talk to about sex.
No, really. Really, Pheebs, you're not gonna be the one worrying about saving for college, or yelling at them when they're bad, y'know, or deciding to put them on Ritalin when they just won't calm down. Y'know?
I'm sorry it's just, Phoebe just always thought you were, you were charming in a, in a sexless kind of way.
Ow!
Because... We may not be who she thinks we are but no-one will ever love that baby more than us.
But we are not the one she chose! How can you feel okay about this?
I am so glad you guys got together, Chandler and I are always looking for a couple to go out with and now we have one!
...so then the farmer says, "That's not a cow and you're not milking it."
Please, when he left town you stayed in your pajamas for a month and I saw you eat a cheeseburger.
OK, I wasn't in love with him and I was just helping out a friend.
So, if you're parents hadn't got divorced, you'd be able to answer a question like a normal person?
Oh I do! Op, no, wait a minute, I took it out of my shirt when I put it on this morning.
You guys, I ordered some chocolate pies from that bakery on Bleecker. Could you pick them up for me?
Oh, yeah, happy needless-turkey-murder day.
Having a perfectly decorated tree is not what Christmas is about. It's about being with the people that you love.
Wow, Monica's letting other people help decorate her tree! Did someone get her drunk again or?
Ok, you see, the tag shouldn't be at the top left corner, it should be at the bottom right corner.
You're pretty much running that risk either way.
You're going to talk to him! Y'know what? We made a deal, I make your decisions and I say you're going to talk to him.
Oh, I don't know. I don't know.
Okay, Rachel, do you have any idea how painful it is to tell someone that you love them and not have them say it back?
Well, y'know what, that doesn't matter.
"Hi I'm Rachel, is my sweater too tight? No? Oh, I'd better wash it and shrink it!"
You know what else I'm not gonna miss? "I'm Monica. I wash the toilet 17 times a day. Even if people are on it!"
Okay, Okay, All right. What if we got both houses? Huh? We can turn this house into a guest house.
The only way that that is going to happen, is if the other couple are the Hitlers.
Ah no, you see, someone was supposed to take them down around New Years... but obviously someone forgot.
So tell me something, is leaving the Christmas lights up part of your plan to keep us merry all year long?
Okay, everybody relax. This is not even a date. It's just two people going out to dinner and- not having sex.
Just, 'cause, I don't want her to go through what I went through with Carl- oh!
Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet!
Jeez!
Tonight you're supposed to waitress for me, my catering thing, any of those words trigger anything for you?
Hi.
Did anybody else feel they just wanted to peel the skin off their body, to have something else to do?
God. I feel violated.
It's okay. I suppose it could happen to anyone, not anyone I know, but... By the way I can still see it.
Well usually...yeah! Well, not just lemonade, iced tea, sometimes juice. Well, sorry, I just, I thought you liked me. I'm such a jerk.
Look at it! Ohhh! Wallpaper's a little faded, that's okay. Carpet's a little loose. Hardwood floors!!
I know that.
Wow! You're a lot sturdier that Chandler. He crumpled like a piece of paper. So how was you're trip?
Wow! Skates!
Oh, he is. And he is so dreamy. I mean, y'know what, when he left I actually used the phrase, 'Hummina-hummina-hummina.'
Oh yeah! So ah, kinda pretty, pretty good. He sounds like a nice, good guy.
Oh please! Yesterday on the subway? You couldn't stop staring at that woman with the big breasts the whole time.
Excuse me?
Maybe we could call the phone company. Maybe they could change the message. Maybe they can change his number.
Okay, okay, okay, I've got two cabs and no people. Go! Go! Go!
Oh! Let's see, well...if this is the wedding hall then umm you're parents will be at home in Queens.
Hey, so where are my parents gonna be?
I can't believe you married Duncan. I mean how could you not tell me? We lived together, we told each other everything.
Well, I mean, I'm not married married, ya know, he's just a friend and he's gay and he's just from Canada and he just needed a green card.
Maybe. Joey: Wait. Your 'not a real date' tonight is with Paul the Wine Guy?
Paul the Wine Guy, Paul?
Yeah. But of course we had to update it a little bit. Hey, by the way, great thinking about catching me!
Uh, wait, so you guys are telling me you actually did the routine from eighth grade?
Do you realize that four weeks from today we're getting married? Four weeks baby!! Four weeks!!!
Diane Keeton.
Oh..please!I-I welcome criticism. 3rd Customer: The musician right outside the restaurant...it's kind of a mood-killer!
Thank you! You haven't said anything... 3rd Customer: Actually I do have one small complaint.
Do you realize this is probably the last time we'll all be here in the coffee house as six single people?
Oh, let me get this. These are for you.
Okay, we'll start with the building. You guys take the first and second floor, Phoebe and I'll take third and fourth.
Oh, my, God, c'mon, you guys! He's gonna be home any minute! He's gonna kill me!
Oh, I know! Umm, is it because he's always correcting people's grammar? Whom! Whom! Sometimes it's who!
No that made me feel precious.
She's only a couple of months pregnant. She liked our application but who knows if she's gonna like us.
And so incorrect!
Yeah. Go over to Joey's. Go over to Joey's and drink some beer and hammer up some drywall.
Nah, Nah, it's okay. I feel like I need to be in guy place. You know, do kind of like a man thing.
Would you stop? We've only been going out a couple of weeks, I mean we don't even know if he's gonna propose.
Mon you definitely have to make it a theme wedding, and the theme could be, "Look how much money we've got!" Y'know, I mean you could put, you could put money in-in the invitations! You-you could have like little money place settings. And ah, you could start with a money salad! I mean it'll be dry, but people will like it.
Ok, my husband just gave your boyfriend some very bad advice. Look, David is going to propose to you tonight.
Are you leaving "The Supremes"?
How do I tell Chandler that it's too soon. It's gonna break his heart, he's not gonna think that I don't love him anymore.
Girls say it to me all the time! And believe me, if she's anything like me, she's just gonna be relieved.
Am I on fire today or what?! Those birds are browned, basted, and ready to be carved!
We're, we're just gonna get a little sip of water.
See? This is exactly why I'm making this candy. We can learn their names and get to know our neighbors.
I do. There's uh, let's see, Guy With a Mustache, Smokes-A-Lot Lady, Some Kids I've Seen, and A Red-haired Guy Who Does Not Like To Be Called Rusty.
Chandler, this is crazy! What did you even say to him! "Come up, meet my wife! Give us your sperm"!
Well, we're talking about sperm donors and Zack may be the guy! I mean, look, he's intelligent, he's healthy, he's athletic, I mean, he is "spermtastic"!
Does she use the cups? Yes! I believe she does. Does she use the plates? Yes! I believe she does.
All right buddy, time to roll over. No-no! No, no-n-n-n-no!! You are going to a clinic! You're going to a clinic, and a pyjama store!
Chandler, if that dog's been here that long, and you haven't had a reaction, maybe you're not allergic to this dog?
Really?
All right, I'm gonna show you something a lot of guys don't know. Rach, give me that pad, please? All right. Now...
Look, you have to help me! Okay? I mean, I know what to do with a woman, y'know, I know where everything goes, it's always nice. But I need to know what makes it go from nice to, "My God! Somebody's killing her in there!"
Oh, I so can't believe this! My uterus is an inhospitable environment? I was trying so hard to be a good hostess!
Wow! Fortunately she has a very pretty face!
So I'm not supposed to share my doubts and fears with the guy I'm gonna spend the rest of my life with?
All right, I've never been engaged and I've never really been married, but I can only tell you what my mother told me. Whenever you have doubts or fears or anxieties about a relationship, do not communicate them to your husband.
Well, I guess we should go back in. When you gave me another chance, I guess we should do the same for Amanda.
I won't know what I would do without you.
: do you know how many times I've seen him jump up like that, believe me I know what he was doing.
well watching sharks? Are you sure that's what he was doing?
Okay listen, y'know when you move in Rachel's room is gonna be empty, you wanna talk about what we want to do with it?
I don't know! How about, "Thanks for taking the message." Jeez!
Okay, looks like Ross and I are captains. Okay, so um, I bunnied first so that means I get to pick first. Joey.
Bunny!
How great are you, you little saver?! I mean, the-the amount you have is exactly the budget of my dream wedding!
Ohh! Really?!
No that is not what happened with us. Well, I was umm, I was really sad that night because this guy that I was Ross's mom.
Yeah!! I call that London style.
Yeah, ours pretty much sucked, oh, but, I did run into little Stevie Fisher. Remember him?
Oh, well, it pretty much sucked. How was yours?
Let's take a walk. Y'know maybe you should consider writing for Talking Out of Your Ass magazine!
I always thought having a heart attack was nature's way of telling you to die! But you're not gonna die. I mean, you are going to die, but you're not gonna die today. I wish I was dead.
What? what? He obviously thinks that's a nice way to be proposed to, plus he'd never suspect it!
Uuuh!! How about at a Footlocker?
Oh my god, Emma. Oh, sweetie, I forgot you were here. Oh, you're right, we can't do this. We can't leave her alone.
Because of Emma.
My mother's driving me crazy, but Ross is getting married. I'm happy. I'm not going to let anything spoil that.
So how are you doing?
Come on Phoebe, let's go! Come on, it's time to get serious, huddle up. Joey, keep your head in the game.
All right, so are we not having dinner at all?
Oh no-no-no, it's only one night a week, and plus I get to take all of you out for a lot of free dinners.
How could you say yes, what about our catering business?
Okay. It's zero hour. All teams execute on my count. Let's get this bad boy on the road.
I love you.
Yeah, well kinda cute, like really kinda cute, or kinda cute like your friend Spackel Back Larry?
Anyway, I'm going out with Sergei again tonight, and um, could you come and be the translator's date? So that when we, it's time for our alone time, you two could split off. Y'know, he's really, he's kinda cute.
'Cause I just keeping thinking about all these things that I'm not gonna have and it's freaking me out. I don't know what to do about it.
No. Why?
Hey that reminds me, I thought we could use some extra luck so I brought a wishbone home from work.
Hey you guys! Ok, you're not going to believe this! I just saw my psychic and she said I was definitely gonna win the lottery tonight!
Isn't it? Then what about the amazing wainscotting and the crown molding and the dormer windows in the attic?
It's perfect. It's everything we've been looking for.
I'm sorry. But not that sorry, 'cause you don't have to live with it. Um, we have a reservation under the name Chandler Bing.
Hi, could we get two burritos to go, please?
'Cause they took our apartment, I wanted to punish them. But I'm-I'm done now. They've suffered enough.
Well, why did you make like a whole big thing out of y'know, everyone has to hang out in the big apartment?
Ok, I'm sensing that this is some kind of word play, because you are pink with barely controlled glee.
I do! Want a hint? huh? "I do" "I do".
No, honey, its. thats a special plate. See its a game, whoever gets that plate wins.
Hey! How come my plate's less fancy then everyone else's? Do you not trust me with a fancy plate?
No, I think we should save our china for something really special. Like if the Queen of England comes over.
Yeah. Hey, here's an idea, why don't we use our wedding china today?
You are so cute! No. No, it was a fight. You deal with it and move on! It's nothing to freak out about.
So, this isn't over?
You see that guy? He's in classics now, but y'know as soon as we leave he's going straight to the porn.
It's good to see you too.
All right, let me see. Will Chandler have sex tonight? Don't count on it. Seems like it works to me.
Well, I don't know what else to do. I mean, I either keep my wife and lose one of my-my-my best friends or I keep my friend and get divorced the second time before I'm 30! So-so if anyone has-has a better suggestion, let's hear it! 'Cause I-I got nothing! All right, don't be shy, any suggestion will do. Okay then. Here we go. Magic 8 Ball, should I never see Rachel again? Ask again later. Later is not good enough. Ask again later. What the hell! This is broken! It-it is broken!
I missed this apartment! Now, this is a grown-up's apartment! Y'know, I-I should be with a grown-up, do you know what I mean?!
Oh. Whew!
He just told me at the counter. He made me promise not to tell, but I couldn't hold it in any longer!
What?! Really?!
Phoebe, your face is fine! Come on, none of this stuff is going to happen to you! Stop being such a baby!
I feel like my face is swelling. Is my face swelling?
Hi, Ben. Hi. I'm your Aunt Monica. Yes I am. I'm your Aunt Monica. I...I will always have gum.
The head, the head. You gotta...
Uh, no. Loosely translated 'We should do this again' means 'You will never see me naked'.
What? He said 'we should do it again', that's good, right?
Hey. Okay, so umm, since that video camera thing didn't work out uh, I thought that I would give you just a little preview.
Hey.
How could you mess this up? It's so easy? You go into the booth, you count to five and you turn around!!
Oh My God! You can do a duet of Ebony and Ivory all by yourself!
Hey Rach, the adoption agency needs letters of recommendation and we were wondering if you would write one for us.
No! No... and, for the record, I've also never given her a frosting from a can!
Oh my God. That was so amazing! When did you Hold on! I almost forgot loser! When did you stop sucking?
And that's... how... it's done!
Hey, it's Phoebe and Rachel. Um, why don't you tell them what you were telling me earlier about me not being high maintenance?
Hi, oh hi.
Yeah, we switched meat suppliers at work, and the new guys gave me the steaks as sort of a thank-you.
Cool.
Absolutely! Yes, you say to him "I'm sorry Mike I can't live without her, she means too much to me!"
Really? You think?
Ok first of all...It would be great. But that's not what I'm here to talk to you about. I need to borrow some money.
I'd be lying if I said I haven't thought about it myself. Chandler is my best friend, it would be wrong. Good......But wrong.
Abso... ...lutely. See, I love creating new recipes. I love Thanksgiving. And, well, now, I love Mockolate.
Well, anyhoo, um, we are looking for a couple of chefs who can create some Thanksgiving-themed recipes. You think you might be interested?
It's gonna be ok. Ryan's been under water. He's just gonna be so glad that you don't have barnicles on your butt.
I, I, I'm hideous.
I don't know. I mean, you saw him do a love scene, so maybe you don't have a thing for Joey, maybe you have a thing for Drake.
So do you think that my dream means anything?
Huh. So you're saying like umm, if there was an award for the best bad massage, well who would get that?
Okay, hear me out. Okay? You give the best bad massages. If anybody was looking for the best bad massage and they were thinking to themselves, "Who's the best of that?" They'd have to go to you.
Because I need the money, and I thought that it'd be a great way to get rid of that last little schmidgen of self-respect.
How come?
You wanna finish this right now? All right, we get a deck of cards, high card wins. What do you say?
What? Shut up! We're winning!
Oh, she was a cruel, cranky, old bitch! And I'm sorry she died. Did Dad say I get the dollhouse?
Well ah, Aunt Silvia was, well not a nice person.
And it could be soon. I mean, think about it: right now, somewhere out there our baby could be being conceived.
We are gonna be great parents.
Deep Impact was the one with Robert Duval, Armageddon is what's going to happen to you if you wake me up.
I know, just quick-quick question, quick question. Which one was Deep Impact and which one was Armageddon?
Oh wait, wait, unless you happened to catch the Reruns' production of Pinocchio, at the little theater in the park.
I doubt it. Mostly regional work.
I made her. Steel drums don't really say "elegant wedding". Nor does Marjorie's overwhelming scent.
She did? Why?
Dad, dad this is a good thing for me. Ya know, and you even said yourself, you've never seen Richard happier.
Am I supposed to stand here and listen to this on my birthday?
So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks?
...And I read about these women trying to have it all, and I thank God 'Our Little Harmonica' doesn't seem to have that problem.
Sex! This is the last day I'm ovulating, and when we don't do it now, we'll have to wait till next month.
Fine. What!?
Well, at least you have one thing to be happy about. That jerk Gavin from your office didn't show up .
Yeah, I just get a little bummed when my birthday's over.
The strange part was, he was really nice, umm and he looks great, but I didn't feel anything at all!
But again, Simmons. Go on.
Isn't that sad? I mean, can you see how pathetic that is? You shouldn't be jealous. You should feel bad for him.
This is about you and Richard. He's clearly not over you. He keeps a tape so he can... look at it whenever he wants.
I think this is so cool because none of our friends are here and we can be a real couple. We don't have to hide.
Oh, we had a lot of liquor left over from the Christmas party.
Okay, you stay here, and just wait by the phone. Spray Lysol in my shoe, and wait for Ross to kill you.
Well, what'm I gonna do? What'm I gonna do?
All right, hold on okay? First thing's first. Okay, now did Ross sit anywhere while he was naked?
Oh well you're the best. You come here to me.
I don't know, my hand feels weird. I guess it's because, I'm engaged! How long before it starts getting annoying?
What's the matter honey?
Listen, um honey, I appreciate this but you don't have to keep hanging out with them for me, I mean, they have each other.
It's the basketball playoffs.
Y'know in a weird way, you have too much power. Look, you're gonna have to help me out here, 'cause I only have three.
Eight o'clock is the cut-off and, aww, it's 8:02.
I need a few more things to make the margaritas. Uhh, I need some salt, some margarita mix, and tequila.
Hey! What's up?!
Oh it's so cute. I wonder what age it is when you stop being able to put both legs over your head.
Oh, look at little Leslie stretching in her sleep.
No, he's not. And if I can't get pregnant with you, then I don't want to get pregnant by... him or anyone else.
Yeah, he's better!
This is so wild. Ya know, I gotta admit, I was kinda surprised that you agreed to go on a blind date.
Sure.
It is so great to meet a guy who is smart and funny, and has an emotional age beyond, like eight.
Yeah, isn't he?
Is there any chance that you can look at this as flattering? I mean, she's doing it because she wants to be more like you.
I just can't believe this is happening. I mean, when I was little, everybody's parents were getting divorced. I just figured as a grownup I wouldn't have to worry about this.
Well. Sounds like you're writing yourself a little play there Rach. Wow! Let me know how that one turns out.
I overheard you guys on the phone the other day, and you said, "I'll just tell Rachel that I'm doing laundry for a couple of hours." And he said, "Laundry? Is that my new nickname?" And you said, "No! You know what your nickname is, Mr. Big."
What?! I mean, I didn't work this hard and-and-and lose all this weight so that I can give my flower to someone like him!
Well guys tend to get naked before they're gonna have sex.
Come on, get into bed! I want to prove to you that I'm not sick! I wanna make you feel, as good as I feel.
I was asleep. Oh no! No-no honey! Y'know what's sexy? Layers. Layers are sexy. And blankets are sexy. And oh! Hot water bottles are sexy.
And Nancy said that it's really under price, because the guy lost his job and has to move in with his parents!
And the fireplace in the bedroom.
All right, I'm gonna go steam my wedding dress okay? Who wants the responsibility of making sure nothing happens to it?
To the Bings!
Well that's a little crazy. Although I am y'know glad to hear that you're branching out on what you look at on the Internet.
Yeah, Big Brother.
It's 2101 and I am not amused. . Ok, the bride and groom have a few words they'd like to say.
Is that what you say to Chandler?
Wow! Look At This! I Can'T Believe I Even Fit Into This Shirt! Oh, this is yours.
Oh, yeah you loved that glove! You took it every place you went. You never went any place without that glove.
No, no, not a party. Just a surprise gathering of some people Rachel knows. Um, this is Phoebe and Chandler and Joey.
Ohhh, you're having a parteee.
Oh, I know, I never wear fake ones. I just did it so my Mom wouldn't give me grief about me biting them.
Your nails.
Oh man, they think they are so slick messing with us! But see they don't know that we know that they know! So...
No! Not unless! Look this must end now!
Oh my God! Oh, this is incredible! Ohh! All right, y'know what? I'm just gonna roll right into that office and-and quit!
I guess you can.
Good! Now, take those salads to table 4, And you! Get the swordfish! And you! Get a haircut!
No, it's really good.
Thanks. I'll call you tomorrow. Okay. Okay, let's let the Alan-bashing begin. Who's gonna take the first shot, hmm?
I've heard schho much about all you guyschh!
I don't know, I've never had to use the other one. I'm just saying y'know, if we're having sex, he's not gonna be talking.
What's the other one?
No way, with one pound to go, c'mon. We're workin', we're movin', we're in the zone we're groovin'.
Monica, it's 6:30 in the morning. We're not working out, it's over.
Look Rach, we have to move. I mean if they had lost, we would've made them get rid of the birds. Right?
You can't just ignore the bet! It's a bet! You bet and you bet and if you lose, you lose the bet!
That's right. You're making a commitment and that's the same, whether you do that at the Plaza or, where are you gonna do it?
We, you know, we're different! We don't care about having a huge party. This is really nice for you, but, oh, please, I put this on? And, ow, I look , why, well, radiant. All right, well, who cares, I don't need a pretty veil and a fancy dress.
I'm making a list of all the things that are most likely to go wrong at the wedding. Now, that way I can be prepared.
What 'cha doing Mon?
Y'know what? Y'know when I said that I want you to deal with this relationship stuff all on your own? Well, you're not ready for that.
Yeah, but still, cheap shot!
You're right, you're right I shouldn't freak out. 'Cause this is what will happen when you and I have babies! When will that be?!
Is not as important as the fact that Phoebe took care of the babies all by herself.
Look, maybe this is none of my business, or maybe it is, I don't know... but, uh, I'm kind of worried about you.
Yeah, OK.
Oh my god, where's my purse? No, you know what? I can replace everything in there. Get that binder, and let's go!
I didn't get to the bathroom. I bumped into Owen on the way, and he didn't know he was adopted. And there's a slight chance I may have told him.
Oh no-no-no, not Dr. Burke. Dr. Burke is out of town. The-the on-call doctor will see me now.
Dr. Burke will see you know.
It's not a date, okay. I'm just gonna teach him how to make lasagne for some pot luck dinner he has.
Well, she spent the last six months getting over him, and now she's celebrating that by going on a date with him.
Okay, the realtor said another couple made an offer. Maybe the Janice's won't get it! Maybe the other couple will.
This can not be happening!
I know!! Chip? Hi! It's Monica. 'Kay. 'Kay. Okay. Okay, good-bye. Oh my God, we just had the best conversation!!
Monica, you're so lucky! He's like the most popular guy in school!!
It's easy! Just keep it casual! Give him a kind word, shake his hand and give him the money!
Yes! Santa's coming!
: what means if he gets like a disease or kills someone. not if he gets his jollys to jaws!
man sharks. I always knew there was something weird about that dude. But you promised to love him no matter what.
Are you crazy?! We own those two! I mean look at 'um, he can't breath and she's popping pills.
Let them win one.
Here, let me show you. Okay, the towels are hanging next to the sink, and umm, you can use the fancy soap.
Where can I wash up?
Oh, no. He doesn't have time for that. But if you want, you can go help him and Joey pack up the guest room.
Hey, is Chandler here? We talked about catching a movie.
I've not seen her since high school graduation. Oh my God, that night she got so dru. . . motional.
Yep.
You call eight hours alone with my label maker wasted time? Ooh, now I get to use my shredder!
I don't think I have to hear the rest. Advertising makes perfect sense. Sorry you had to waste all this time, though.
Because I don't have the money or the equipment to handle something that big on such short notice. I mean there's no way.
So, uh, why did you have to turn it down?
Ok, right about now the turkey should be crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside. Why are we standing here?
Yeah, but did they have to shoot him down? I mean, that was just mean.
Listen, I'm sure that dad doesn't care. He probably thought this was funny; he'll be telling this story for years!
Now, I know you wanted to bond with my dad, but did you really have to bond to that part?
Is that why he's acting so weird...? He's jealous...? Oh my God, that is crazy. It's not like I'm attracted to Geoffrey...
Really? Do you not know Chandler?
Well no wait a minute that's not true! No, what did, that was really sweet. And it kinda works out for the best.
Ugh...
I gotta go water Pete's plants. Y'know what, if he's gonna break up with me, maybe I won't water his plants.
He's good with rear things, bring him in too.
Honey, that's okay. I actually know this woman, Nancy, who's a restaurant biz head-hunter. Maybe she'll know of something.
'So Cheesy' also has an opening.
Well, the end table is wrong, The couch looks bizarre and don't even get me started on the refrigerator magnets.
No, I don't see anything different other than the fact that the room got so much brighter when you came into it.
Soon! I-I just couldn't before. You saw how upset Joey got! I couldn't do that to her, she's my best friend!
Okay, when are we gonna tell Rachel what is actually gonna happen?
Well, CHP because I used to have a crush on Eric Estrada. And ZXY becuase I think it sounds zexy.
How come those?
Oh my God! It's true!! Oh my God you are so amazing! Oh my God, can I just ask you to do me oh, just one favor?
Sure. Yep.
No no no, if I couldn't pay you back right away then I'd feel guilty and tense every time I saw you.
Monica, if you want, I can lend you some money.
All right Rachel, you sweep behind, I'll pitch it to you, you throw it down field to Phoebe. All right. Break.
Come on Mon, let her throw the ball.
I had to go all the way to the basement because some idiot keeps stuffing the trash chute with pizza boxes!
Hey, being you is finally gonna pay off!
You are! Hey, here's twenty bucks. -- Why don't you go buy yourself something pretty while I'm at work tomorrow?
Actuary... no. Book-keeper... no. Topless dancer... Hey, d'you know what I just realized? You are the sole wage earner. *You* are the head of the household. I don't do anything - I'm a kept man!
Well umm, we were just talking about the y'know, the Swing Kings and just wondering whether y'know, they were the right way to go.
What are you guys talking about?
No, last time you said it like Dracula, and it scared her! Can I get you anything? You want some more ice chips?
Next time, can I say breathe?
Yes. Uh, yes, I did. That was my friend, Eddie Moskowitz. Yeah, he likes it. Reaffirms his faith.
Did you just say Hi, Jew?
It's so weird, how did Joey end up kissing Charlie last night? I thought you'd end up kissing Charlie.
Can't believe you guys bought that, enjoy your slow death .
Okay, just so you know, I'm gonna be ovulating from tomorrow until the sixth, so don't touch yourself in the next 48 hours.
No, no, no, no! No, no, no, no! It's okay, it's okay. I didn't go. Don't cry, it's just a bit! I'm your uncle Chandler; funny is all I have!
I have like five times, but the guy is so charming, that I go up there to yell and then I end up apologizing to him.
Why don't you go up there and ask him to 'step lightly, please?'
Look, these clowns are trying to take us for a ride and I'm not gonna let 'em! And we're not a couple of suckers!
Yeah.
All right, come on guys, let's go! Tie score, and we're runnin' out of time. Forty-two!! Thirty-eight!! Hike!
Hey! Well, I've been preparing for that my entire life! Or something about you that's mean!
Well it wasn't that many guys. I mean, if you consider how many guys there actually are, it's a very small percentage.
Er, uh, I'm just gonna go. Sorry.
Well, I'm never gonna listen to you again, that's for sure! "Y'know, harm can it do if you go and put your name down?"
What are you gonna do?
Oh, I haven't had that feeling since I first started going out with Chandler. Wow, I'm never gonna have that feeling again am I?
I just like him so much that I just feel like I've had 10 drinks today and I've only had six.
I love you. Hey listen umm, when, when you were talkin' about our future you said cat, but you meant dog right.
I love you so much.
Honey, we were at this beautiful place, and I-I-I just put our names down for fun! I mean, what's the harm in that?
I'm not freaking out. Why would I be freaking out? A woman named Heldi called and said we were getting married, but that happens everyday.
Good? Didn't you hear them...I was great! Thank you so much for making me do this. That's is the best gift ever.
Mon', not that you didn't sound good, but...
Chandler! It happens to lots of guys! You-you-you were probably tired, you had a lot of champagne, don't worry about it!
Let's do it!
Well, I said 'no' to her coming over now! I couldn't say 'no' twice! I get this uncontrollable need to please people!
Why, why, why didn't you just say no!
Well, I don't know... I-It's... just the way you say it... I mean, you're funny... You have that funny thing. You're a funny guy!
What is so funny about that?
He used to lock himself in the basement for hours. No one was every allowed to hear, "The Sound."
Yeah.
And the musicians, look, they can go over here , okay? And the chairs can face this way , and... You go.
Okay? But-but imagine a lot more lights, okay? And-and y'know fewer bricks, and-and-and flowers, and candles...
Honey, uh, this is a picture of the frame guy posing in front of a bright blue screen with a collie.
OK, look, see, this is him. My mother gave me this picture before she died, same guy.
Wait a minute. What about that summer during college that you lived with grandma, and you tried to make it as a dancer?
Uh, I haven't.
Ugh, I guess it got sent to the billing address as opposed to the shipping address. Uh! What a pickle.
Oh my God, what's it doing here?
Yeah and if I had seven, maybe I would've said something like this, "Wow! My boyfriend's such a wise ass-seven!"
The only way that I said six would be if the seven's, let meet at seven, not at six.
Yes there is! He's black and white and shaggy and he's sitting next to Rachel and licking Rachel's hand.
No, there's no dog here?
Not that, this, US. Oh my God, Ross, you-re, you're, it's jus-, you-, ever sin- you been here.
Well, I guess we could tape Entertainment Tonight.
Aww, sweetie, but it's not like you're not gonna have anything. You're gonna have nieces and nephews, and some ways that's even better.
Okay that's even sadder. Look, I know, I know what I got myself into, it's just that now that they're in me it's like, it's like I know them y'know, I mean-I mean, it's just not gonna be easy when these little babies have to go away.
Yeah, she hates all mass produced stuff. She thinks her furniture should have a history, a story behind it.
Phoebe hates Pottery Barn?!
This isn't mine. Hey, this isn't, this isn't my stuff! Ugh, Ross! These are your boxes! Where are my boxes?
Oh, I don't know how that got in there.
Well for your information he happens to be one of the brightest, most sophisticated, sexiest men I've ever been with.
Who's Richard Burke? Doc, Doctor Burke? You have a date with Doctor Burke? Why, why, why should that bother me? I, I love that man, he's like a uh, brother to dad.
Aw, my little nephew. Come here, little one. There's my little baby Ben. Hey, my little boy. Hey, he's not crying.
They, uh, were infected. He wouldn't have made it.
This is not, what I'm wearing. I'm ovulating and Chandler's gonna be home any minute, so I thought we would try before dinner.
Wow, so glad I changed. Almost wore my ??? outfit that can't contain my breasts.
Come on Rach, when a guy says he's going to call, it doesn't mean he's going to call. Hasn't it ever happened to you?
To her face? Look it's the end of the date, I'm standing there, I know all she's waiting for is for me to say 'I'll call her' and it's just y'know, comes out. I can't help it, it's a compulsion.
Used to work with her. Used to! I'm a relative and I didn't get invited! A blood relative! Blood!!
Oh, I used to work with Frannie.
Hey, Rach! I made a pile of your stuff over on this side of the room. If you could just......throw your purses at it.
Well, it's just that maternity clothes are so expensive.
Huuh, alright, Danny Arshak, ninth grade. Oh, c'mon Rach, you know the bottle was totally pointing at me.
Not uh, not to my recollection.
Ours is so much better! This living room is smaller, the dining room looks like a cave! What a hole!
It feels like we're cheating on our house. And if we're gonna cheat, shouldn't it be with like a hot, younger house, that does stuff that our house won't do?
Umm, excuse me, we switched apartments. You can't eat are food anymore, that-that gravy train had ended.
Hey!
Don't get too cocky! Remember I won the last one! Oh, by the way, how did that feel, losing to a girl?
Game, point!
Okay. All right, turkey. Eh, that won't work. Cheese? That won't work. Olive loaf? I hope that won't work.
Have at it.
Ok, these were unbelievably expensive, and I know he's gonna grow out of them in like, 20 minutes, but I couldn't resist.
You're welcome.
Noo!! The point is that is was you that was there that night! It is you that I am marrying! It is you that I feel in love with!
Oh, it's not important? It's not important?! If it wasn't for a bride's maid you'd be marrying him not me!
Why?! To celebrate your relationship! To solidify your commitment! To declare your love for one another to the world!
Yeah, well... Y'know, it just got me thinking though, why would anybody ever want to get married huh?
Oh my god. We're trying to get pregnant so he's probably starting to freak out about the fact that my body is going to change.
I don't know! I mean, what brought that on?
She has a better chance of sprouting wings and flying up your nose than you do of not making fun of us.
Maybe your resolution is to not make fun of your friends, especially the ones who may soon be flying you to Europe for free on their own plane.
What are you being such a weenie for? So he has a Barbi, big deal. You used to dress up like a woman.
Look, G. I. Joe's in, Barbi's out. And if you guys can't deal with it, that's your 'too bad.'
Oh, hey handsome! Oh, I'm gonna love you so much that no woman is ever gonna be good enough for you! Oh, we are so lucky!
Well, that's spongy.
Alright, wait a second, why would Ross tell everyone in your class that you are as... "gay as the day is long"?
There you go sweetie... This isn't over.
Oh, I'll have an espresso. Oh acutally, I'll get it. If I ask you to, you'll probably end up drinking it yourself.
Does anybody need anything?
All right Rach, for what it's worth, I think that you're doing great. I mean y'know let's face it, no one handles this well.
Get out, get out of my apartment.
No sweetie, you've got to win over the guy that controls C.H.E.E.S.E.! You've got to kiss some serious robot ass!
Thanks, but I kinda have a problem to deal with here.
No, a doctor of meat. Of course he's a real doctor. And he's handsome, and he's sweet, and know you'd like him.
A real doctor?
Hi. Hi, uh, yes, this is Monica Geller. Um, I believe I'm taking some classes with you and I was wondering what they were.
Hey.
Ok, so I think I'm just about done here, unless you have any bad stuff hidden somewhere, like... porn or cigarettes?
Celebrity.
I don't need an actual man, just a couple of his best swimmers. And there, there are places you can go to get that stuff.
That, that's what's stupid.
So, maybe I am a little high maintenance. And maybe Rachel is a little bit of a pushover. But you know what we decided you are?
Okay.
We left Joey alone with the food! Yep! Yep, I knew it! There he is... feeding stuffing to a dog!
What?
I cannot believe that I just spent the last two days trying to figure out the recipe and it was in my cupboard the whole time!
Yes!! Ohh.
Mom says it's all of Manhattan, parts of Brooklyn and Queens, and they have no idea when it's coming back on.
Wow, this is so cool, you guys. The entire city is blacked out!
Joey, what's it like on a movie set, huh? Do you have a dressing room? Do you have a chair with your name on it?
Aw, come on! It'll be years before I forget you!
Oh, um, around 8:02. We ah, talked for a little while, and then um, we went out for an innocent burger.
When did this happen?
No, Ross, we do not hate Emily. We-we just, we just think that you're having to sacrifice a whole lot to make her happy.
Nooo!!
Chandler that's crazy! If you give up every time you'd have a fight with someone you'd never be with anyone longer than-Ohhh!
Because of the weekend, we had a fight.
Okay, look, this is probably for the best, y'know? Independence. Taking control of your life. The whole, 'hat' thing.
I helped!
I know, he's too charming, but if you two start going out, then it's just gonna make it so much harder for me to hate him.
Well, he's very charming.
Dad, please don't pick your teeth out here! Alright, and if you're gonna put your feet up, why don't you sit on the-
Alright, alright, now-now who should I say tricked me into doing it?
You know what? I don't care. I like it like this, and I'm gonna keep it. You're just jealous because your hair can't do this... OUCH!
Again, let's journey back... As I recall what Rachel said, was she had never notice the shape of your skull before. And Joey... Well, Joey didn't realise that there was anything different.
Look! You knew this about me when you married me! You agreed to take me in sickness and in health. Well, this is my sickness!
But...
All right, I've got a whole bunch of uh-uh, stuff in this area, but umm, I'm getting the feeling that you don't want to deliver.
Monica!
Thats not how you see me, is it? Phoebe while cutting a sweet potatoe in the air: No you're all about the fun.
Yeah and we'd want to make sure Emma has someone like Monica who is more uh. uh discliplinarin.. someone who can be firm and strict.
Okay, Ben, I won't tell your daddy that you had ice cream for dinner, if you don't tell about our little bonking incident.
Okay. If you're alive you answer your phone!
I don't know, how about the idiot who thought he could drive from Albany to Canada on a half a tank of gas!
Oh, who should I blame? The nice bell man who had to drag out luggage to 10 different rooms?
Y'know, no point in dragging it out. Dragging out the long process of you moving out and us not living together anymore.
Okay!
Yeah, once again, I am sorry. Thank you. Bye. I just had to turn down a job catering a funeral for sixty people.
It's gotta be better than that book. Oo! Like a crossbow!
Well... That's not the only time this was an issue. You remember when umm, you spent Thanksgiving with us? You called me fat.
Look I know it was a stupid reason to break up with somebody, but I was 15!
Oh, well. Now that I'm here I might as well help you with the cleaning and organizing! Just happen to have my label maker!
Yeah.
Umm, I'd love too! Ooh, I love macaroni and cheese. I love-I love the way this box feels against my cheek.
Monica, I was wondering if you can make me some of that righteous mac and cheese like last year.
This is where I thought the barca lounger could go! You see you could see the TV and it's still walking distance to the kitchen.
Oh my God! Someone's killed Square Man!
Hello? Chandler, what's wrong? Oh my God, are you alright? Yeah, I'll be right there. I'm so sorry, but Chandler was in a car accident.
Yeah well, in America you're just an "ass".
Ohhh! Let me see! Oh God, I can't believe this! They're an hour late and they're just staying out there, talking!
They're out there!
Sounds smart and healthy to me. So um, just out of curiosity, um, do you currently have any other racquetball buddies?
Absolutely, this will just be something we do, like racquetball.
You know, I know that things could still go wrong but if they don't? If this works out, we're gonna have a baby Chandler, a baby!
So we're standing firm on the 'not getting our hopes up'?
I just don't think arcade games go in the beautiful guest room. The beautiful guest room is gonna be filled with antiques.
So, that's it?
: Joey I am not going to objectify woman with you but if her face is as nice as her ass woah mamma.
Hey, this girl won't turn around and I can't tell whether she's hot or not, what do you think?
Listen, uh, you told me something that was really difficult for you. And I, I-I figured if you could be honest, then I can to.
You know, you read about it, you see it in the movies. Even when you practice it at home, man oh man, it is nothing like that.
Joey, you know, maybe your just not used to kissing men, maybe you just tensed up a little, maybe that's what you need to work on.
Then I don't know what it is. What's the problem?
Okay, I think that's it. The seating chart is done. This is our wedding. They all look like they're having fun don't they?
Stop picturing it!!
That tape was never meant to be seen by... Joey I would feel more comfortable if I was having this conversation in private.
Whoho ho... Listen to the judgement from the porn star!
Ahh, Pete, the other day when you said you needed to talk, umm, just so I know, is it good news or bad news.
Hi, how ya doing?
Okay, if you need the vacuum, it's in my closet on the left-hand side. Ah, the garbage bags are next to the refrigerator...
There it is.
Hi Amanda! Actually now... it's... is not a good time. Dinner tomorrow night? Ok, Phoebe and I will see you then!
I get pedicures!
I give good massages! I used to give them to Rachel all the time before she got allergic! And-and-and Chandler loves them! Watch!
As a masseuse and a human, I'm begging you, never do that to anyone!
Naaaa... He still kills me. Last night he had me laughing so hard, I swear... a little pee came out.
Did that guy really make that joke?
Y'know what? I am really tired of your bellyaching! Okay, I-I worked really hard at making this a nice place for us to live!
Monica, you don't even have a bed, you sleep in a ball on the floor!
It's just... It's hard enough not seeing you during the week, but for Christmas... alright, if this is what you have to do, I understand.
I'm sorry, I won't be here.
Nononononono. Think who you're dealing with here. I mean, I'm not like you. I-I can't even stand in front of a tap class.
There's an open call for Cats. I'm thinking we go down there, sing Memories and make complete fools of ourselves. Whaddya say?
Okay? Over here we have pink suede, which is nice. But umm, if it gets wet then you know it's gonna shrink.
Ah.
Rachel if you, if you want to go out with him, you can. Sound like a big jerk to me but if that's what you want to do...
He just kept asking, and asking, and asking, and asking, and asking, and asking.
Honey! Do you know that none of that stuff came from me?! I mean I never said I wanted to have babies and get married right now!
Yeah, I'm kinda wishing everyone wasn't here right now.
Ohh, of course we are! We left it up to fate. If we were supposed to get married there would be a clear-cut sign.
Yeah. We're doing the right thing, right?
Look honey, I wanted you to hook up with Ross as much as you did. But he's with her now and you're just gonna have to get over it.
Ooh, Julie's so smart, Julie's so special.
Money is so impersonal. Cookies says someone really cares. . . Alright, we're broke, but cookies do say that.
You gave him cookies?
Yeah, well I don't think it really counts if you have to read them off the back of your hand after you fall asleep on the couch.
You get your messages!
You may be okay about getting hurt, but I am not okay with being the one who hurts you. That's why I can't take this job.
Look, the only who stands to get hurt is me. And I'm okay with that.
Oh yeah, I remember mine! Ohh, it was my sixth birthday, my dad took me to the park, I got it, and...it bent.
His first big kid's bike, this is so exciting!
Ya know, I was thinking. Ya know how we always stay at your apartment? Well, I thought maybe tonight we'd stay at my place.
Um, we should go too, I got patients at 8 in the moring.
Why don't you just weigh out the good stuff about the relationship against the bad stuff. I mean that's what I did when I first weighing stuff.
Y'know, maybe she is too young for me. Y'know, when I was over there and she was running around with her friends, I felt like I was a baby-sitter. I finally started to see what you guys were talking about. I don't know what to do.
Mom already called this morning to remind me not to wear my hair up. Did you know my ears are not my best feature?
How we doing, you guys ready?
Who da wenny-Benny boy? You the Wenny-wenny-Benny-Benny boy, yes. Don't cry. Don't cry. Why is he still crying?
Hi, it's me. Listen, Bob. I'm probably way out of line here. I mean, It has been 3 years, and you're probably seeing someone else now, but if we could just have one night together, just for old time's sake, one hot, steamy, wild night...
He cannot play at our wedding! I mean everyone will leave! I mean come on, that is just noise! It's not even a song!
Why is your family Ross?!
Okay, I have to get that. Now when I get back, I want you and your friends to be gone. Thanksgiving is over. The Vein has spoken.
Nice!
Well he is! Yeah, I mean marriage is all he talks about! My goodness, in fact, I'm the one that's making him wait!
Okay that's fine, I'll walk away. And I'll never bother you again, but only if you tell me Chandler's willing to give you everything I am.
Now everybody knows the basic erogenous zones. You got one, two three, four , five, six, and seven!
Look, you don't have to draw an actual wo-whoa! She's hot!
He's great! I mean we have such a good time together! He's so funny, and sooo sweet, and I'm not attracted to him at all!!
Mr. Millionaire, new from Snooty Playthings! Third wife sold separately.
I'm not really here. Just thought I'd drop these off...on the way.. my way... Do you come here a lot? Without me?
Nothing, I just thought I'd stop by.. y'know, after the uh... that I.. y'know, so what are you doing here?
I mean I-I thought you were nuts at first, but you-you did it. And now you can just look back at this thing with no regrets.
It would be nice after hearing 20,000 people chant "You suck!"
Well, I just think the baby would keep falling off the dog. Do you, uh, do you , do you not see kids in our future.
You really need the bassinet?
Okay, all right, I think you're great, I think you're sweet, and you're smart, and I love you. But you will always be the guy who peed on me.
Okay. All right.
I wanna buy 5 shares of SGJ and I wanna buy them now. C'mon time is money my friend. Thank you. Wooo.
Uhh, I'm guessing the threshold's clear now.
How can you smoke in this day of age? Do you not seen that ad with a little kid walks to grandpa, it's chilling.
One really does have a stick up one's ass. Doesn't one?
Chandler! Everyone--no one's eating my Tuscan finger food 'cause they're all filling up on Phoebe's snow cones!
Awesome!
Honey, you can relax. Last night at work, Geoffrey told this really sexist joke. After that, not so funny anymore.
Well, I'm off to Tulsa, so if your Maitre D. friend has any funny Oklahoma jokes, tell him to e-mail me at www.hahanotsomuch.com.
I am really an idiot. you see, I was filling out my friend's form, and instead of putting her information, I put mine.
Why?
Is that that couple on the first floor? Because we should get a baby before them. Yeah! That guy tried to sell me drugs.
You know, I... I feel like I've been here before. Are any other couples in the building adopting?
I'd rather hang out with a sniveling work weasel guy when I can be hanging out with my boyfriend who I actually respect.
So I laugh at my boss's jokes, what's the big deal?
Aww, the only reason you want to go out with me because my blond wig, and the big boobs, and the fact that I serve you food.
Hmm, come on, you just said to her that you....
Oh, I still can't believe my dad saw us having sex! He didn't make it to one of piano recitals, but this he sees!
Look, we can't stay in here forever.
Y'know what? He will forgive you. And I like to bring a pad with me when I go answer the phone just in case... Okay...
Already? That's pretty bad what you did.
Well, after 15 years of mom and dad keeping it as a shrine to you, it's time the velvet ropes came down.
I can't believe we have to say goodbye to the house we grew up in. Man, some-some stranger's gonna be living in my room.
Okay. Okay, I can't wait! This is going to be the best Valentine's Day ever! I can't believe it! Make the presents! Make the presents!
Of course, of course not. I just have to uh, go over to the place where I-I made it and pick-pick it up.
So why-why wasn't Ross's stuff ruined? And if you say the words medical marvel I'm going to Easy Bake your head!
I'm afraid so.
Look, there's Chandler. You knew, that stupid friend of Ross'. Said I'm fat. You know I've already lost 4 pounds!
I know. But if some guy who looks like Corey Haim wants to kiss me tonight, I'm sooo gonna let them!
Yeah. But a part of me also can't wait 'til it's over. Chandler and I have this pact not to have sex again until the wedding.
Hey the wedding is so close! Are you getting nervous?
I'm gonna miss this hand! Okay I know it's a lot to ask, but oh my God Chandler, this is a once in a lifetime opportunity.
And you're thinking of taking it? So before you said being me with me was more important than any job, but I guess now it's old job, me, new job.
It's not ok to do it in a doctor's office but it is ok to do it in a parked car behind a Taco Bell?
It's weird! In a doctor's office?
Well, because you signed it baby kangaroo Tribbiani . Hey, why don't you stop worrying about sounding smart and just be yourself!
Why not?
Yeah, and y'know, if you could not mention to them that we live together, that would be great! , I was thinking we would eat around four.
Oh! That's great, they haven't seen the place since I moved in!
Good! Now I need you to be careful and efficient. And remember, if I am harsh with you, it is only because you are doing it wrong.
Yeah.
Oh, sure it does! In high school, you weren't jealous at all even though all your girlfriends were cheating on you!
It does not!
Oh it's not big, not at all, you know, kinda the same lines as, say, oh I don't know, having a third nipple.
I didn't know it was a big secret.
When Mom and Dad drove you to the hospital to get your nose fixed, I swam into the lake and fished it out.
Okay, where in the hell did you get that?!
Guys can fake it? Unbelievable. The one thing that's ours! Besides, why would you fake it when we're trying to have a baby?
Oh yes you can. You just make the faces and the noises.
We're moving in a couple of days and we've got a lot of packing to do. It would be great if you guys could pitch in.
I thought I was going home to go to bed, but I'm sensing there's something less fun for me to do here.
An era is defined as a significant period of time. Now, it was significant to me, maybe it wasn't significant to you!
Oh, all right. But y'know I gotta say, I don't, I don't think six years counts as an era.
I don't know it! I want to have a kid with you because I think you're going to be an amazing dad... at the fun parts and the hard parts.
Yeah, but its not who I am. Everything they said was exaclty why I was worried about having a kid. And its true. And look everybody knows it.
Oh my God, I can't believe what I'm getting ready to say. I wanna have a baby, but I don't wanna have one with someone who doesn't really wanna have one.
But you're not.
What if it's new? I mean, we agreed not to talk again, unless we had something really important to say. Shouldn't I call him back?
It's old, it's definitely old. Didn't you hear the, the double beep?
Okay, I got it. Phoebe? All right, you pull. I'm gonna spread the legs as wide as I can. Joey? Now is not the time!
All right, hold on! Okay, let's just all think.
Yes! Carol and Susan's caterer had a mountain bike accident this weekend, and she's in a full body cast.
It really hit me last night. I'm gonna be on Days of our Lives. And then I started thinkin' about all of u, and how these are the days of our lives..
Forget the bubblewrap! There isn't time! Rachel starts messing up Amy's hair: Frizzy frizzy frizzy frizzy!!
Alright. Thats it!
Chandler, we have talked about this. You are not supposed to give people advice! Now couldn't you just have made some sort of inappropriate joke?
Be-cause, we were talking about ways that he could beat Mike and I told him that Phoebe wanted to get married.
White House adviser? Clinton's campaign guy? The one with the great hair, sexy smile, really cute butt?
Hello? Who are we spying on?
Ohh... Oh, that's okay I hate when people come back to complement the chef. Like I have nothing better to do! So what's up?
Actually, I'm not here to complement the chef.
Oh wow! Okay. Don't scare me like that okay? I mean for a minute there I was like, "Oh my God! The worst has happened!"
Oh!
No! To take more pictures of all of us together. I mean I really think it's the best resolution because everyone will enjoy the pictures.
What, to blind my child?
And when he's naked I can throw him out in the front yard and lock the door and all the neighbors will just humiliate him!
Yeah.
I'm fine now, but it was really scary there for a while. I mean, someone slipped a-a threatening note under the door.
No! Smokes-A-Lot Lady blew smoke directly into my mouth. Eh-uh-are you okay?
And it has to go perfectly, because if she doesn't like something about us she can keep us off every adoption list in the state.
Kind of. She's coming by to interview us and see where we live.
Hey! Continuing the countdown of your favorite meals. Tonight, No. 3, macaroni and cheese with cut up hot dogs.
Oh my good God.
The days and nights are hard! I get it! Okay? Look umm, Rachel I'm sorry! I have to start getting ready! I'm getting married today!
The nights are the hardest. But then the day comes! And that's every bit as hard as the night. And then the night comes again...
Sure! If you're just gonna hang out as friends, then maybe I'll join ya. You know, I'm your friend and Mike's friend .
Not if nothing happens. Why can't... why can't we just hang out as friends?
I'm not going to be a part of this! You can't just bring some random guy at home and expect him to be our sperm donor!
I'm telling you, he's great! I mean, even if my sperm worked fine, I'd think he'd be the way to go!
No, those first two windows, that's the lobby. And y'know the other one over there, that's the stairway. You've been counting wrong.
No. No. No. She lives on the third floor, eighth apartment from the left.
Oh, and I can also speak a little French. Voulez-vous coucher avec moi ce soir? Why? What did I say?
Yeah, little change in plans. Ahh, we're gonna break-up instead.
Gee, I don't know Rach. Order up!! I got a Yentel soup, a James Beans, and a Howdy hold the Dowdy!
Oh, I wanna quit, but then I think I should stick it out, then I think why would such a person stay in such a demeaning job, just because it's remotely related to the field they're interested in.
All right, I'm out of oven space. I'm gonna turn on Joey's. Please, watch him! Do not let Joey eat any of the food!
46. Wow! Who's well educated now, Mr. I-forgot-ten-states?
Y'know, I think if I were going to be with a woman. It'd, it'd be with someone like Michelle, she was so oh, she was so petite.
Yeah.
Oh wait, you know what, I got it, I got it, pretend like you just woke up, okay, that will throw her off. Be sleepy.
Hello!
I'll be coordinator! Oh my God! I'm so sorry, I didn't get you anything! Okay, look everybody has to help! Okay? You can help, can't you Phoebe?
No, no don't get mad because look-this is what happened. So I-I started packing, then I realized, "What am I doing? I am lousy at packing!" Right? But you love packing! So, as a gift to you, on our last night, ta-da!
You sat back and let him have her, you didn't fight at all. Am I right? Do you want the same thing to happen with Emily?
I made fun of his accent.
Thanks. Like, check out my new catering stuff. Look at this! I'm an omelet station! Omelet? Made to order!
Mon! I'm so happy for you!
Hey Rach, what about this? Huh? Who-who gets this? See, I don't know if I want it because it might be y'know, too many memories!
Okay.
Oh, my mom called, they're gonna run our engagement announcement in the local paper, so we're looking for a good picture of us.
What are you guys doing?
All right, all right. Maybe I can fit them in if I just do some rearranging. But uh, Rachel may actually have to sit at the bar!
Well this is just sad!
Ok, all right. It was an accident, I swear, all right. I was putting on my jacket, and the thing, and the lamp, and it broke.
I am. Let me just get my coat.
But, you see, it's just... this night has to go just perfect, you know? And, well, Wendy's more of a... professional waitress.
But, but?
I figured out I need to charge seventeen bucks a jar just to break even. So, I've got a new plan now. Babies.
Well, what happened to your jam plan?
Rachel you have to read this book. It's called Be Your Own Windkeeper. It's about how women need to become more empowered.
Woah, woah, woah, what book is this?
Oh...Phoebe? Maybe I wasn't clear before. I really love listening to your music here, but my restaurant is sort of an upscale place.
Here, Monica, look what I got to wear when I play at the restaurant uh, huh wait! Right? I mean, this might even class up the ballad of the uncircumcised man.
That's what we used to call your ah, your motorcycle in high school. Y'know how a motorcycle is a Chopper, and you're Chip. Nevermind.
The what?
It's weird, but you know what I don't wanna throw this away. I mean this is like all I have left of him, gross, drain hair. Ooh!
Getting it away from me would be job one.
I'm on top of the world, looking down on creation and the only explanation I can find, is the wonders I've found ever since...
What? Ow!
I know! Now look, there's only one problem though. There's only room for one, so I guess one of you will have to stay at Joey's.
Oh my God! It sure didn't look this way when I lived here.
Okay! It's time for dinner. Everyone we're using our fancy china.. um and its very expensive so please be careful.
This guy? Seriously? Later in the day.
And, well, don't you have a lot of wild oats to sew? Or is that what you're doing with me? Oh my God, am I an oat?
Right, and...
Ha, ha, very funny, very funny. But I think we'd like to give poker another try. Shall we, ladies?
Oh yes, yes, we could play some other game... like, uh, I don't know... Pictionary?
Well, if you think about it, I am kind of like a Reverend. I mean, as a chef, I serve God, by feeing the hungry and poor.
She likes Doctor Chandler and Reverend Monica.
All right, Chandler can make boxes, Ross can wrap, and Joey can lift things. Now Phoebe, go tell the guys they have to help out!
That's right.
When we found out that we're gonna get this baby, Chandler and I started talking and we decided that we didn't want to raise a kid in the city.
Are you serious?
Wait a minute, why don't you just call Mark. I mean, who says you have to sit here and wait for him, you've got to make stuff happen.
No, I'm genuinely sorry the Mark thing didn't work out. Look, Rach, I want only good things for you.
Great! Well Rachel, the reason why I won't let you drive the Porsche is because you're a terrible driver. There! That wasn't about the wedding.
Okay, I can fix this! Okay Monica, Rachel thinks all you can talk about is the wedding.
That's a good question. Look umm, last night we let the dice decide. Maybe we should leave it up to fate again. I love you!
So where are we on the whole going back to the place where they have all the marriages thing? I love you.
Alright, let me ask you this question: How many of you thought the music was fine, but not in keeping with the tone of the restaurant? .
Ok, ok, how many of you enjoyed the music outside? Ha!
When girls hang out, we don't have pillow fights in our underwear. I'm sorry. We do. We do. I don't know why I said that.
You know when guys hang out they don't just drink some beer and hammer up drywall?
You're just new at this, it'll get better, think about your first day at work. I mean, that couldn't have been easy but you figured that out.
Oh god what am I gonna do you guys, I can't even comfort my own baby! I'm the worst mother ever!
All right people, we're in trouble here. We've only got 12 hours and 36 minutes left. Move, move, move!
Oh.
Yeah, I'm sure your ex-wife will be more than happy to move to another country so you can patch things up with your new wife.
I bet if I talk to Carol and Susan I can convince them to move to London with Ben.
Well, I don't care! That-that turkey has to feed 20 people at my parent's house and they're not gonna eat it off your head!
I can't! It-it's stuck!
I know, I know. I'm just so tired of-of missing him. I'm tired of wondering why hasn't he called. Why hasn't he called!
Monica, you broke up with him for a reason.
That's good, have a seat. Um, the doctor says it's gotta be a needle. You're just gonna have to be brave, ok? Can you do that for me?
Ohhh.
He didn't die. I saw his daughter last week. Said he was fine. Her on the other hand, botched Botox.
Ross said he died.
Hey, see that snippy guy over there? He's the one who decides who gets up on the platform. We should go dance by him.
We know!
Okay, we've been out here for two hours and we haven't seen any stupid comets. Can we go now? I mean, Chandler's getting chilly.
Check out the rack on this chick!
You would not. I can't believe this. I hate this, you're too normal. I can't believe my boyfriend doesn't have a thing. My boyfriend doesn't have a thing.
Boy I would just uh, I would freak out.
Okay, okay, I'm sure that Rachel came home early and picked up Emma. You go look across the hall, and I'll call her cell.
Don't ask me, I was in there canoodling you!
Okay, the reason why I asked you guys out to brunch today is because I have been doing some thinking about who should be my maid of honor.
We'll just see.
That's because their nerves are probably deadened from being so stupid. But hey, y'know if you don't believe me, please, by my guest.
Huh, well, the girls in the satin nighties on the commercial don't seem to think it's that bad.
Great! Umm, well what-what I was doing in Chandler's room is that umm, I was cleaning it! In fact, he pays me to clean it!
Yeah!
Look at these authentic fake medals. I tell ya, mom's gonna be voted best dressed at the make-believe military academy.
Yeah?
Y'know I used to go out with this guy that was a really light sleeper, and whenever I started to snore, he would just roll me over...
Yeah, they do! Quit being a baby and leave me alone! There, you've just had your first class!
Yeah, well, I'm using noise. Okay. All right! So, is everybody ready? Here we go. I hear something! I hear something! Where is it?
Y'know, you-you also could've used uh, lamps and then followed the light.
Is it me? Is it like I have some sort of beacon that only dogs and men with severe emotional problems can hear?
Oh no, don't hate, you don't want to put that out into the universe.
I mean I have not been picked on this much since kindergarten and they had to bring in someone from junior high to do the see-saw with me.
Hey, honey! What's the matter? Fine, I was just trying to be nice! Whoa!
What's to know? Buy sell, high low, bears bulls... Yes Manhattan...yeah telephone number of the stock...selling store.
Monica, what are you talking about? You don't know the first thing about the stock market.
Why don't you phase it out? Yeah, fade the accent out and people will think you're, y'know, that you're adjusting to life in America.
Well...
Paolo, I really hate you for what you did to Rachel, but I still have five of these, so heat it at 375 until the cheese bubbles.
Oh, ok bye-bye.
Oh my god. Today's the sixth?! I may be done ovulating! I may have also served some very questionable meat at the restaurant.
Yes, it's also 2003.
Or, it could mean that-that you saw Chandler and me together and we y'know were being close and stuff and then you just want to have that with someone too.
That kinda sounds like your dream dude.
I wish we at least knew his name... Look at that face. I mean, even sleeping, he looks smart. I bet he's a lawyer.
Maybe nobody's tried this.
Come on! Come on, if we have sex again it'll double our chances of getting pregnant. Do you think that closet's still available?
Honey, we've been over this. I need to be facing the other way.
Noo!! It's driving me crazy. I mean every other way he's like the perfect guy, he has everything. Plus! He actually has everything.
Still?!
A jazz trio for cocktails. The Bay City Rollers for dancing. Wait, that was from my sixth grade wedding.
Aw.
I don't know. Look he's a great guy and I love being with him but... you know. Things happen, and they happen. You don't plan these things.
Could tonight be the Night?
You actually broke her watch? Wow! The worst thing I ever did was, I-I shredded by boyfriend's favorite bath towel.
That's one way! Me, I- I went for the watch.
Okay, everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor. This is everybody, this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my brother Ross?
Oh God Monica hi! I just went to your building and you weren't there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are, you are!
I'll get everybody else , finally we can start celebrating my- I'm sorry, uh apparently I've opened the door to the past.
Okay.
Joey they're not real. I start miles beneath the surface of these things, ok, they're fake. See honk honk.
Alright. If you guys don't want it to be special, fine. You can throw any kind of party you want.
Well, um, look I-I don't want this to come our wrong, but ah, you seem awfully confident for a guy I just told I wasn't attracted too.
I know I'm no John Bon Jovi, or someone who find attractive, I'm just, I think, y'know, that you might end up feeling differently.
Alright here's something, it says to try holding the baby close to your body and then swing her rapidly from side to side.
Well, alright, we already tried feeding her, changing her, burping her, oh try this one! Go back in time and listen to Phoebe!
Sit down. All right? Please, just listen to me. You are terrible at this! Okay? You are the worst ultimate fighter ever! Ever!!
I can't until I'm the ultimate fighter. I will do it. I'm telling you, the day will come when children will argue over who will win a fight, me or Superman. Now, I'm not saying I could beat Superman, but y'know, kids are stupid.
I mean, who knows how long it's gonna take for someone else to give us a baby? What if, what if no one ever picks us?
I know..
No! No you should! A lot of major actors do nude scenes! I mean the chance to star in a movie? Come on!
You're right. Maybe I shouldn't even go on the call back.
Oh God! Orange juice just came out of my nose, but it was totally worth it. Oh my God, I completely forgot about your sound.
Yeah, just a little in high school, but then I really got into it in college. I mean that's-that's when I really found my sound.
Yeah, but he wants to talk to you before anything really happens with her. And as his friend, I mean, don't you think he deserves the same from you?
Well, he's with Charlie now.
Yeah. Anyway, he told me about your apartment. And, um, I couldn't sleep, thinking about it. So, uh, would it be okay if I cleaned it?
Oh, yeah. Oh, you know, that's too bad that didn't work out.
Terrible. If-if I want something done right, I have to do it myself. Other people just wreck stuff. I really think I might kill someone tonight.
Hey Mon, how's it going?
Well, she actually has a boyfriend y'know herself, named Clark. Uh, she also kinda invited herself to our wedding. Clark too.
Right.
I'm making cookies for Erica. And oh, by the way, we have to leave for the airport soon, her plane comes in about an hour.
Why are you wearing my apron?
Oh yeah! I saw her walkin' it down the street the other day. She had uh, these flowers in the basket. It was so cute.
Phoebe really likes the bike huh?
We're not gonna have sex! Okay, nothing's changed here. He still doesn't want children and I still do, so that's why we're just gonna be friends.
Well, you might wanna make a little extra, y'know you'll probably be hungry after the sex.
I'm his sister, okay? I love him! I don't want to see him get hurt! Come on! Doesn't that give me the right to control him-help him?
Noo! Oh no! No! God no! He should not get back together with her. I know that! You know that! Even Ross knows that! But that still doesn't give us the right to erase his message!
If we wanna get on camera, I think we have to get up on one of those platforms. They've been taping those people up there all day.
Why do they keep doing that?
Of course I wouldn't approve, I mean, you were totally in love with this guy who, hello, was gay. I mean, what the hell were you thinking?
I'm sorry Monica but I knew if I told you, you'd get really, like, judgemental and you would not approve.
Uh-huh, but I'm sure you can handle this. I mean, I have won awards for my organizational skills, but, uh, I'm sure you'll do fine.
Wow, this is a lot!
Good morning, Tiger! I'm making you a nice big breakfast so you can keep up your strength for tonight. You're gonna get me good and pregnant.
Hey!
Really Phoebs? Because, you know, you'd have to be an actual waitress. This can't be like your 'I can be a bear cub' thing.
Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. See Phoebe, Phoebe.
So what, he's a little older, big deal, I mean he's important to me. Ya know if you ask him, he might take you on his Jag.
I don't know, Richard's really nice and everything, uh, it's just that we don't know him really well, ya know, and plus he's, ya know, old -er than some people, but, uh, younger than some buildings.
I'm getting married today!!! I think I just cracked a rib. But I don't care because today's my wedding day! My day is finally here!!
Okay. Well there's one down.
Really? But tomorrow night is the only night I get off from the restaurant. If you go to the game, we won't have a night together for another week.
Joey just called. He's got courtside Knicks tickets for him and me tomorrow night.
Okay, just to be clear comedy with the plates will not be well recieved. Ross makes some sort of sound to let us know it hurt.
Woah. Woah... Woah.
Groomsman, groomsman, why are you just standing there, where is your bridesmaid? We've got a broken arrow. Bridesmaid down! Oh, that's me.
It's the dog.
"Tonight's the night we're gonna make it happen, tonight we'll put all other things aside. Give in thistime and show me some affection..."
All right, watch!
Well I'm not sure yet, but umm of the top of my head I'm thinking double sided tape and some sort of luncheon meat.
Like what?
No!! Why didn't you make a copy and-and keep it in a fireproof box and keep it at least a hundred yards from the original?!!
I just went to my old apartment to get you the-the cookie recipe and the stupid fire burned it up!
Hey. It's three in the morning. They don't know that I've come home yet. You notice how neither one of them are wondering where I am.
Whoa-ho-ho! Yeah, okay.
That is a wonder. So tell me something, Mom. If you had to do it all over again, I mean, if she was here right now, would you tell her?
I'm telling you, it's a wonder your mother turned out to be the positive, life-affirming person that she is.
Oh look, the pool table's free. Rack 'em up. I'll be back in just a minute. Get ready for me to whip your butt.
Oh yes, and that's what I want a roommate that I can walk around with and be referred to as the funny one.
Here. Ben, do you wanna play the airplane game, do you wanna show Rachel? Come here. We're gonna do something fun. Okay. Weee!! Weee!!
Look Benny, spoon. Spoon. Come on! All right, y'know what I think he's bored.
Okay! The movers will be here in 11 hours. Rachel has not packed. Now, everybody has to help! Chandler, we're gonna start with...
Hurry! Monica's gonna make you pack! She's got jobs for everyone! Now, it's too late for me, but save your selves!
No, no, no. They say it's the same as the distance from the tip of a guy's thumb to the tip of his index finger.
Nah, not so much. Alright, now we smoke. Oh.. my.. God.
Oh, it's a great party! Great food. Y'know, most parties it's all chips and salsa, chips and salsa. So umm, what's this?
Hey! What's going on?
Ohh, she's looking down the hall. Oh! She looked right at me! Oh wait, you can't see people through that little hole, can you? Hello!
You want me to take some girl I've never met to the opera so you can go to a club and flirt with some guy, hmm, that-that is a toughie.
Ohh! Umm, Phoebe, I kinda need to talk to you about that. Umm, well I-I-I think it might be time for me to take a step back from catering.
Okay, is this the day of good news or what? I got us a job! The wedding reception.
Fine! Don't be my friends! I'll buy new friends! Yeah, and then I'll pay for their plastic surgery so they'd look just like you!
All right, believe me.If you win the lottery, it's the last you're gonna hear from us!
Oh yeah, she didn't hire me out of pity, it wasn't so she could pick on me in front of her friends, she actually thinks I'm good.
Okay, I didn't hear that.
Well then, y'know what? I care about you to much to watch you hurt yourself like this. So if you have to do this, then you're gonna have to do it without me.
Y'know I have a torn rotator cuff, a hairline fracture in my right forearm, and a severely bruised Adam's Apple, but that really hurt.
It's so sweet. It really is. It has this big yard that leads down to this stream and then there's these old maple trees...
You put an offer on a house?
Ok, so that's what we're doing. You know, when I'm in the coffee house bopping along to one of your songs, I'm wearing ear plugs.
Well at least all my songs don't taste like garlic. Yeah, there are other ingredients Monica.
Oh, yeah, right! And after I took a shower this morning I just threw my towel on the floor! Oh God, it hurts to even joke about it.
It's all done!
No, no, no. Honey, I'm ok. Shake it off! Oh, no! No shaking, no shaking! Ooh! Ooh! Oh my God! I can't play!
You ok?
Oh no no, this is not for him, this is for me. That way he's still sober but I find his stories about shoelaces much more amusing.
What's going on, is... uh, Bobby drinking again?
YOU BET YOUR ASS I AM! I just had the best first day ever! The kitchen: twice as big as Allessandro's.
Honey, you're screaming.
The second that Ross walks in that door, I want you take him back to your bedroom and do whatever it is that you do that makes him go, rweee!!
Okay.
Of course it was! Trust me, when it comes to psychology I know what I'm talking about. I took two psych classes in college.
Ah! Well it was Joey reading Drake's lines in the dream...
All right then, go fight for her! Go to London! I mean, that could be you and Emily! That, but-but nicer. Just, go to London!
No.
Okay, fine. Let's talk about snow. -- Do you think it's snowing in Tulsa, where my husband is having sex on a copying machine?
Aren't we done with that?
So wait, Ross's stuff is fine, but I have no memories because you wanted to keep the bottom two inches of your car away from water!!!
Well, I used your boxes to divert water away from the Porsche.
Well, he did this bit... You probably had to be there, but it was Liza Minelli locked in our freezer, eating a raw chicken.
Yeah, he came up...
It's gotta be one of a kind. Y'know like umm, y'know uh, what's that God awful ceramic fruit bowl she has on her counter?
Well this has story behind it! I mean they had to ship it all the way from the White Plains store.
No! Y'know, the fantasy! Meet someone from a strange land, fall in madly love, and spend the rest of your lives together.
You had fantasies about Emily?
Oh, well... um, that's all there are of these. But in about eight and a half minutes, we'll be serving some delicious onion tartlets.
Like 'em? I could eat a hundred of them!
C'mon Chandler, I think we have been given an opportunity. I mean, the mistake has already been made. They are writing up the paper right now.
Your Veal Chop is $34,95!
Well, so far I have uh, my bride's maids dresses won't get picked up, my veil gets lost, or I don't have my something blue.
What are they?
Y'know, I really have to tell Rachel, but I... We just have to get it over with! Y'know, the next time we see them we're just gonna tell them. Okay? That's it.
No, no, I keep trying, y'know? I can get out, "Joey, I have too..." but then I lose my nerve and I always finish with, "...go to the bathroom." He may think I'm sick.
Hey guys! You found the presents? Chandler, you let them find the presents? Great! Do you know how long it took me to find you that water purifier?
Fine!
We're Aunt Monica and uncle Chandler, by the way. You may not recognize us, because we haven't spoken to your parents in seventeen years!
Hi Emma! It's the year 2020. Are you still enjoying your nap?
Oh, Rach! Rach! Umm hey, could you do me a favor and would talk to Chandler's dad and try to keep him away from Chandler's mom?
Thanks you guys.
Okay! Very funny! Somebody let me out please?! Come on, I'm cold! And covered in marinara sauce! Come on! Let me out!
Fine!
Myself. Y'know for remembering to pack a thing. Yeah, you do a good thing, you get a check! My mom does it, I never realised it was weird.
Who are you saying "check" too?
I thought I was making headway, everyone was smiling at me all day, I get off work and I find out that they wrote this on my chef's hat.
Oh.
Nooo! Never! I mean, we're living in the moment. God, it is so nice for once to not have to get all hung up on 'Where is this going?'
Come on, like you never talk that.
That is completely untrue. You think I'm high maintenance? Okay, prove it. I want you to make a list and we're going to go through it point by point!
Fine. The reason that I was leaning a little bit more toward Rachel than you is just that you're ... just ... kinda high maintenance-Okay let's go to lunch!
This baby has got everything. Take y'know, locations for instance. First, organized alphabetically, then geographically, then by square footage.
Oh my God, the wedding book?! I haven't seen that since the forth grade!
If you have the big apartment you have to deal with people coming over all the time. That fridge has got to be stocked, okay, that's your department now.
There's gravy?
Uh, look, Larry honey, umm, I wrote the book on Section 5 and I know that you don't have to wear your hat unless you're in the kitchen.
A 98. I deducted 2 points because you are not wearing your chef's hat, and that is a Section 5 violation.
Let me think. Oh, when I was younger I used to dream that I got married to Mayor McCheese, and on our wedding night I ate his head.
Have you ever had any weird romantic dreams?
Well, we're trying to find someone to perform our wedding and they're all either boring or annoying or y'know, can't stop staring at the ladies.
With what?
Hello? Oh, Hi, Ju Hi, Jew! Uh huh? Uh huh? Ok. Um, sure, that'd be great. See ya then. Bye.
My mommies love me. That's clever.
Oh, please, stop! Look, we're supposed to be honest with each other. I-I just wish you could tell me-just say, "I don't like your massages."
Listen, I just wanted to apologize about this afternoon and the whole massage thing. Y'know? I-I really like 'em.
It's worse. The only thing that's getting me through is knowing that I'm gonna be seeing you soon. I think I may even try to get out of here early.
Oh come on, come on, it can't be that bad.
It's not like I want to get married tomorrow! It's just that I-I'd like to believe that I'm in a relationship that's actually going somewhere, that I'm not just wasting my time!
Chandler giving you a hard time huh?
Yeah. In fact, I like her so much you tell her I want my cookies early this year! Y'know, a box of Thin Mints and some Tag-a-Longs.
Well thanks!
Oh, what a great argument, exhaling! All right, y'know what, I'll prove it to you, okay. I'll trade you Joey for Rachel, and I'll still win the game.
You're so pathetic! Why can't you just accept it, we're winning because I'm better than you.
Well, you're... you're different funny... I mean, you're... you're more sarcastic a-a-and... well, he does... bits... and impressions... and... and limericks...
Oh yeah? Is he funnier than me?
Well now, I get to spend my shower with the only people I really love! I mean, I get all those presents without having to talk to people I don't even like!
What do you, what do you mean?
Hey, the point is that he was at everyone of your swim meets and he was there cheering you on! Okay? That's a, that's a pretty great dad.
No-no all kids are embarrassed by their parents, you'd have to come up with a whole new word for what I went through. When I was in High School, he used to come to all of my swim meets dressed as a different Hollywood starlet. Y'know it's hard enough to be fourteen. You're skinny. You're wearing speedoes-That your mom promised that you would grow into! And you look up into the stands and there's your dad cheering you on dressed as Carmen Miranda. We was wearing a headdress with real fruit that he will later hand out to your friends as a healthy snack!
When two people finally realise their feelings for each other, and-and they talk for hours, and they-they learn all about the other person!
What?
Nothing, I'm just trying to recreate some of the fun that we had at my place the other day. Remember, when you picked Rachel over me? That was funny.
Monica, what are you doing?
De-caff. Okay, everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor. This is everybody, this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my brother Ross?
Can I get you some coffee?
Umm, actually I was about to tell you that I was, I was going to get out of it, but hey, if we're just goofing around then uh, maybe I will go out with him.
Oh, is this about you-you dating the nurse? Yeah, Joey already told me, and I am so-so fine. I mean, you and I we're just, y'know, we're nothing, we're goofin' around.
Um, yeah, so uh, uhh, listen, I'm sorry I didn't tell you this before but umm, I, I'm no longer at my job, I, I had to leave it.
C'mon Monica, do it. Hey, you guys, um, Monica has some news.
Could you please tell me what this is in reference to? Yes, hold on. Um, they say there's been some unusual activity on your account.
Oh, God, ask them what they want.
Oh umm, that's because I just wanted to y'know walk in on me and Chandler while we were, y'know, doing it all night. Will you excuse me for just a second?
You're not? Then why did you ask us if we wanted to go?
All right, eight we get married, but 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12 we don't get married.
Yes, we don't get married unless there's a sign! Okay, so say uh, say you roll another eight then there's a definite sign that we should get married.
All right, Rachel's party is in a couple of hours and there's a lot to do. Now, Ross, you got Geller blood, you're in charge of these yahoos!
Jumping on the bed?
Well, you guys have been friends forever. Remember the first time that you kissed Ross? How weird that was? You couldn't stop laughing? You got through that.
I do not know what's wrong with us, I mean, we have kissed before and that's been great! But this time it was leading somewhere and I was very aware of the fact that it was Joey touching me.
Man, this sucks! Y'know if Mom and Dad don't see us on TV after we made them so jealous, I mean, who's gonna be the losers then?
Hey, now you're the one who wet his pants.
Y'know what, I've got to walk out of here right now, 'cause getting over you is the hardest thing that I have ever had to do. I don't think I could do it again.
Okay, okay, one thing's changed. But we still want different things and we know how this is gonna end.
Well, my breasts are going to get bigger weather you like it or not! And you know what? It's not just my breasts. My ass is going to get bigger too.
Argh. fascist.
Honey, we've been trying to have a baby for over a year. I think it's a good idea to find out if everything's ok. Just a few routine tests.
We really need to take those tests?
Look. I'm sure there's some friendly way to reconcile this! Um, have a seat. First of all, we haven't been introduced, I'm Monica Geller.
Yes, but there isn't always time!
You would not believe my day! I had to work two shifts, and then to top it off, I lost one of my fake boobs, in a grill fire.
Sorry. I'm sorry.
What don't you just calm down Phoebe! All right?! Why don't you just get all your facts before you run around telling everybody that you're the only hot couple!!
Okay, you know where you are better than I do. I was just curious.
Why did I 'woo-hoo'? I mean, what was I hoping would happen? That-that he'd turn round and say 'I love that sound, I must have you now'?
I can't believe you did that!
I know! It's just that...ever since high school Rachel was the one person I told everything too. Y'know? I miss that so much now. She's my best friend.
But we're not ready to tell yet!
I think it's totally insane, I mean, they work for the hospital. It's like returning to the scene of the crime. You know, I say we blow off the dates.
Not stupid. The very cute, cute, cute doctors asked us out for tomorrow night, and I said "yes."
Oh, what'd ya bring me?! Awww, hotel toiletries from Japan. Oh, these are gonna go in my permanent collection. You want some coffee?
Well...
Okay. Oh but Joey, come over later because I'm going to teach you to make a bird feeder out of just a pine cone and some peanut butter.
Monica, could you excuse us for a second? I need to talk to the girl with the flowers.
No I totally disagree. No I think it's fine for a guy to do something like that. Such you an actor. Not that you need to,your eyebrows are...
On how far along he's in the sex change process!
Wait a minute! Unless, we give her all gifts she can use after she's done being pregnant. Like-like umm, regular coffee, Tequila.
Oh my God! We are throwing the most depressing baby shower ever!
Exactly. Oh, I love that I can be totally neurotic around you now. Tell me the truth. Don't you like it better now that everything on your desk is perpendicular?
You know, I like the way you have efficiently folded this tab under. See in a tape emergency you could shave valuable seconds off your time.
Ohh, I'm so glad. Thank you so much for staying so calm during this. I mean it's really, it's made me stay calm. I coulda been worse!
Yeah. Y'know I keep thinking that something stupid is gonna come up and I'll go all...Chandler. But nothing has.
Listen umm, I've been thinking, it's not fair for me to ask you to spend all of your money on our wedding. I mean, you work, you work really hard for that.
Hey.
Hello? Oh, hi Wendy! Yeah, eight o'clock. What did we say? Ten dollars an hour?... OK, great. All right, I'll see you then. Bye.
Well.... it is amouz-ing...
This wasn't addressed to Days of Our Lives, this is, this came to your apartment. There's no stamp on it, this woman was in our building.
Ya know, in crazy world, that means you're married.
Y'know what? After you're with this woman for like ten minutes, you forget all that. I mean, she is this astounding person, with this, with this amazing spirit.
What?! Are you insane? This woman stole from you. She stole. She's a stealer.
It's so good, that I feel really selfish about being the only one who's eating it, that I think we should have everyone taste how good it is. Especially Ross.
Really? How good?
All right uh, the important thing is to take your time, you want to hit 'em all, and you mix 'em up. You gotta keep them on their toes.
Well you might if it were anything like 7!
Ya know, my party is fun. I mean, maybe it's a little quieter, less obvious sorta fun but, you know, if people would just give it a chance...
Alright, I'm sorry but these people needed me. They work hard all week, it's Saturday night, they deserve to have a little fun. Go.
What?! Are you crazy? You just had Ross's baby! It's-it's so inappropriate. No, it's worse than that. It's wrong. It's... It is bigger than mine!
Well, I-I said yes.
Anyway, we're really excited about our wedding plans, and well I guess pretty soon we'll be making a big withdrawal from the Monica wedding fund. What?
What?! They wanted a scary story!
Wow, that's a big cable bill! Huh, you don't have a job, but you have no problem ordering porn... on a Saturday afternoon?! I was in the house!
Wa-wa-wa-wait! Congratulations! You did it! You did it! You can relax now. Yeah.
Okay, I gotta go find Rachel but umm, if you guys see her could you please try to give her some really bad news so that mine doesn't seem so bad?
Wow! Big day huh? People moving in, people getting annulled...
Oh, friends first, drunk in London, you know the story. I've got a better question for you: Do you or any of your blood relatives have diabetes?
Okaaay... so eh... so tell me, how did you guys meet.
Okay, here's batch 22. Ohh, maybe these'll taste a little like your grandmother's. This has a little bit of orange peel, but no nutmeg.
Do you want me to learn?!
Well you know it's just like living with a girl. Only they don't steal your makeup. Unless they're playing "This is what my sister would look like"
I know it's so exciting! You know I've never lived with a guy before.
They want me to do it, which is really cool, seeing as I've never catered before, and I really need the money, and this isn't a problem for you, is it?
Yes!
OH GOD NO! Nope, no, no, no. No! No, no. Nope! No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. NO! No!
So you're not friends with him?
Because I know that you think the lottery is "boohaki" but we're all here and gonna watch the numbers and have fun. And you're my brother, and I want you to be a part of this.
Why?
Okay so this is where the band is. And this is where the bar is. And all these pins have people's names on them. And Rach, here you are.
So that's two of my wives.
Ok. Hold on. Geller here! No! I said it has to be there by 4 o'clock. Goodbye. Oh, how hard it is to make an ice sculpture?
Ok.
That was that girl Megan! She booked the Swing Kings on the day of our wedding and said that I couldn't have them back unless I gave her the dress!
What?!
All right, we still have a minute and a half to go, and we're down by two points. Two points.... Phoebe you do a button-hook again. Rachel, you go long.
All right, no, well I want to kill them to, but their boys, y'know how are we gonna beat three boys?
The woman from the museum called and said that there was a cancellation and that we could move up our wedding and Chandler heard! I know! How bad is this?!
No! Why?
No no, the father can, but um, since I am the roommate I can tell you that she's not here and I'll pass along the message, ok. So bye-bye.
What? The father can't drop by to see the daughter on her birthday?
Why? It's just that I've waited seven years for an opportunity like this, and you can't even wait four and a half minutes for a stupid onion tartlet?
Why?
Sure. Oh, um, Chandler? Y'know, the-the old Monica would-would remind you to scrub that Teflon pan with a plastic brush...But I'm not gonna do that.
No, no resentment, believe me, it's worth it. 'Kay? Y'know in a relationship you have these key moments that you know you'll remember for the rest of your life? Well, every- single- second is like that with Aurora.. and I've just wasted about thirty-five of them talking to you people, so, uh.. Monica, can you help me with the door?
"Hi, uh, Richard it's Monica, um, listen I did something kind of crazy tonight, um, maybe I'm getting my period or something, I don't know." Nooo!!
Outgoing! Did that say outgoing?! Not, outgoing!!!
Yes. I hated you. I mean I, I, loved you in a 'you're my brother so I have to' kind of way, but basically, yeah, I hated your guts.
You hated me when we were kids?
Okay, the owner of Allesandro's came over to yell at me, but instead I made him some sauce, and he offered me the job as head chef!!
Hey Mon, little question for ya! How do you think this suit will look on an assistant buyer?
Whoa-whoa-whoa, Phoebe you gotta take her! Y'know I-I-I said some really bad stuff about her, but y'know Rachel has some good qualities that make her a good roommate.
Well, Phoebe that's fine because I'm not moving.
Okay, forget the specials for a minute. Umm, all right here's the thing, for the last two weeks I have umm, tried really hard to create a positive atmosphere...
Well, sure, that too.
Phoebe, it's okay. You don't have to tip toe around me. I-I've been thinking about it and umm, y'know what? I'm okay about not having that new relationship feeling...
Bye! We said good-bye at the door so as not to flaunt our new love.
Okay, guys, listen, don't forget that tomorrow is the day that Emily gets married again, so whatever we do, just try to really keep Ross's mind off of it.
Hm-mmm.
Be that as it may, d'you think you could just help us out here on that monkey thing? Y'know, just for old times' sake? Go Bobcats?
What?!
Okay ah, please don't freak out. Umm, but ah, there's a blue fingernail in one of the quiche cups, and there's no way to know which one.
Honey, don't bite your nails.
We're waiting for the adoption lady, but, hey, I'm glad you're here. I was cleaning this morning and I found this . I don't know if you wanna use it, but...
Hello, is this the creepy residence?
Okay. It's-it's about Alan. There's something that you should know. I mean, there's really no easy way to say this.. uh.. I've decided to break up with Alan.
There it is!
Chandler is supposed to find out if he's getting an assistent job at his ad agency. But out of the 15 interns, they are only hiring three.
What's going on?
So, I'll get candles and my mom's lace tablecloth, and since it's Rachel's birthday, I mean, we want it to be special, I thought I'd poach a salmon.
Excellent.
No. No, just, just, just a couple more boxes. It-it-it's no big deal, all right, I'm-I'm cool. You gotta help me out with a couple more boxes!
Monica, I'm cutting you off.
Oh, about five minutes. Right now they're interviewing his opponent. Apparently he trains by going to Iran and pulling the arms off thieves.
Hey! How long until Pete's fight?
I've got a plan. I've got a plan. I'm going to ram this platter really hard into your ribs. You're gonna scream out and that'll wake her up!
I know, what are we gonna do?
Y'know, all these years, I thought you were on my side. But maybe what you were doing was sucking up to Mom and Dad so they'd keep liking you better!
Nonono, thatthat's not what I was saying...
I can't wait to be with you! I'll sneak over as soon as Ross picks up Ben. I'll just tell Rachel I'm gonna be doing laundry for a couple of hours.
Oh, fine! Take his side!
You're the most wonderful man. And if you hadn't of said 'if I have to' like seventeen times, then I'd be saying 'okay, let's do it.'
Yeah, if I have to. Monica, I don't wanna lose you, so if I have to do it all over again, then I will.
Ok, how about this: We got wind up toys for Emma for her birthday. We can make them race, and whoever comes in last, stays!
Right.
Well, if you're gonna be totally rational about this, I can't argue with you! All right? Fine, if you wanna tell him, tell him. I just don't want to be a part of it.
Yeah well unless we tell him.
Hey, have you guys eaten, because uh, Richard and I just finished and we've got leftovers... Chicken and potatoes... What am I wearing?...Actually, nothing but rubber gloves.
What, what's about to happen? I've never seen this part before. Hey, Travis, watcha doin' with that gun? Oh no, no no Travis, put down the gun. No no no no, he he's your buddy, he's your Yeller, no, no no, the end, THE END.
You can't say that!! You-you don't know!! I mean I thought I was gonna pass out from the pain! Anyway I-I tried, but I-I couldn't...bend that way. So...
Ewwww!!
I know...God. I haven't seen my savings take a hit like this since I was a kid and they came up with double-stuffed Oreos. What happened to all our money?
Did you see our bank statement? Can this be right?
Oh, But you're finally doing something that you love! I can't ask you to give that up. Though it'd be nice if the thing that you love was y'know... finding gold.
Maybe I should quit and get a job that pays.
How do you think I am?! You've wrecked all my childhood memories. You love Ross more than me. And I just rubbed a dead mouse on my face!
How are you honey?
Ok, for my next song I think I'll sing something a little more upbeat. All right? Oh, how about the PointerSisters "I am so excited". And make it bouncy!
Comb my eyelashes.
Lewis Posin! He was my best friend in fifth grade, and-and then one day I asked him to be my boyfriend and he said no. Do you know why?
Who?
I-I'm not gonna be able to make it into work today, I don't feel very good. Yes!! Wow! Uh, for a second there I thought I was really better, but I'm not.
Really?!
Chandler... In all my life... I never thought I would be so lucky. As to...fall in love with my best...my best... There's a reason why girls don't do this!
Oh my God.
Hi, Dad. No, no, it's me. li-listen, Dad, I can't talk right now, um, but there's something, um... there's something that I've been meaning to tell you...
Monica and Rachel's apartment. Err yeh, aayah, yeh, just one second... ..ah, Rachel, it's your dad.
Wait a minute, Phoebe! We should be partners. We should be catering partners. I mean, think about it! You're not working right now, and we have such a great time together!
Yeah. Hard Ass and Wuss. We could fight crime!
Are you trying to tell me that we're moving to Oklahoma, or that you're gay? All right, not that this matters, but did they at least offer you a huge raise?
Really? Oh What A Beautiful Morning! Surrey With A Fringe On Top.
Hey, Joey, I don't think that you should leave Chandler alone. I mean it's only been two days since he broke up with Kathy. Maybe you can go fishing next week?
You don't have to stop having fun just because I'm here. Kathy didn't cheat on all of you. Well, except you.
Okay Ben, why don't you come open some more presents, and Santa, the Armadillo, and I have a little talk in the kitchen? There's a sentence, I never thought I'd say.
You bet I did, Ben, put it there! Well, it would have worked this time, if his hands weren't so damn small! Ho, ho, ho!
You invite my brother, you invite my whole family, and not me?! Why?! What-Why wouldn't you want me at your wedding? What could I have possibly done?! Stuart!
Hi Frannie, congratulations.
But I'm gonna be there... for the rest of my life. I mean, I can't break up with him. I'm the one who made him quit drinking. He's dull because of me.
Maybe it was just the kind of story where you have to be there.
OK, look. That is Aunt Iris. This woman has been playing poker since she was five. You gotta listen to every word she says. Hi!
Assistant buyer. Oh! I would be shopping... for a living!
If you would stop thinking about Ross for one minute you would notice that there are great guys everywhere! I mean, look! Look, Gunther! I mean, he's nice, he's cute.
I bet it was about her a little.
Anyway, Ross and I were always captains, and um, it got kind've competitive and one year, Geller Bowl VI, I accidentally broke Ross's nose.
No, no, no, you say that proudly.
But I need it. Otherwords I'm gonna have to take that horrible diner job. You know, with the dancing and the costumes. I don't wanna have to wear flame retardant boobs.
I, I don't have it.
I mean they're trying to do everything they can to make me quit, and if there were any other job, I would. But this is something I've been waiting for my whole life.
Ohhh!
: Oh well this is the only one they had at our video store, but they did have something called crocodile killers. Or does it always have to be sharks?
no I'm not quite sure you got the right movie that's all.
Yeah, well, I'll take a little crying any day over Howard-the-"I-win"-guy. "I win! I win!" I went out with the guy for two monthsI didn't get to win once.
Pete the Weeper? Remember that guy who used to cry every time we had sex. "Was it good for you?"
Ok, Mike, enough is enough, now you love Phoebe and she loves you, so you need to get over your whole "I never want to get married" thing and step up!
Hello?
Chandler, here you go, got your traditional Thanksgiving feast, you got your tomato soup, your grilled cheese fixin's, and your family size bag of Funyuns.
Thank you. Thank you so much!
No. No. Not it. Not it. Not it. Don't crowd me! This is it! This is the dress! Oh my God, it's perfect! I'm sorry, this one's taken! Whoa!
Hey! Rachel! Come on!!!!
No, thank you! You have given me so much! I mean, if it wasn't for you, I would never have gotten to sing Memories on the stage at the Wintergarden Theater!
Oh. Thanks.
We'll try to be more careful okay? It's just that, we don't want everyone to know because this is going really well, and maybe the reason it's going really well is because it's a secret.
Well, yeah actually.
Man, I would be great in a war! I mean, I really, I think I would make a fantastic military leader. I mean I know I would make General way before any of you guys.
I wonder how I would react under fire, y'know? And not backfire but-but heavy fire, like I was in a war or something.
Oh, you know, my flock is good, I mean, yeah, my flock pretty much takes care of themselves at this point. Good flock. Flock, flock, flock.
I was wondering you both have such serious jobs. Would you have time to take care of a baby and your flock?
All right then, then nothing changes! Everything is great! Everything stays the same! And you go unpack because it's been three days and it's driving me insane!
No!
Well, instead of being sad that tonight is my last night together with Rachel we thought we'd go out to dinner and celebrate the fact that Rachel is moving in with Phoebe.
Okay! So, what do you girls have planned for tonight?
Oh, why does this bother me so much? I mean I don't wanna be one of those people who tells their boyfriend they wanna spend 24 hours a day with them.
Ok.
Okay Ben, why don't you come open some more presents, and Santa, the Armadillo and I have a little talk in the kitchen? There's a sentence I'd never thought I'd say.
What?
Chandler, you're not fourteen anymore. Okay? Maybe it's time that you let that stuff go. If your father's not at your wedding...you're gonna regret it for the rest of your life.
Does it matter?!
Oh my God, the cat's made my eyes water! Don't-don't throw it to me! My vision's been compromised!! Oh God! Okay. Okay. It's okay. Man, that was close.
No Mon that's not the point. I'm out a thousand dollars, I'm all scratched up, and I'm stuck with this stupid cat that looks like a hand!
Ok people, we are back in business! Oh God, we've missed you soo much! Ok, go and get your hair and make-up done, and I'll take care of everything.
More than I wanna get married.
Please... honey, leave the details to me. Now I wanna make this day as special for you as I can. Now, ok, I was thinking that the harpist should wear white.
Ice sculpture? That sounds really fancy! I told you I just want a simple wedding.
Who? I mean have you seen a car come by here in the last hour and a half? I think we should call Ross, maybe he can get a car and come pick us up.
Ugh, okay, well somebody will come and save us.
I just can't believe you're in here. I mean, what am I gonna do without you? Who's gonna crash the embassy parties with me? Who's gonna take me to the Big Apple Circus?
Well, actually, you only got to sing 'Memo-'.
That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong. Y'see, he's the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born.
Yeah, calm down. You don't see Ross getting all chaotic and twirly every time they come.
Hmm, no. I mean how can I accept a restaurant from him? I-I-I-I can't. I couldn't even accept a necklace from Stu Vincent in the seventh grade.
And you're still not attracted to him at all?
Ok, so there's not a magazine under the couch, or a pack of cigarettes taped to the back of the toilet tank, or a filthy video in the VCR?
I don't, and I'm offended by the insinuation!
Oh my God. Phoebe. Don't look now, but behind us is a guy who has the potential to break our hearts and plunge us into a pit of depression.
Just wanna check my horoscope, see if it was right.
I actually know someone in advertising. I grew up with this guy who is a vice president at a big agency. Maybe I can get him to meet you? Give me the phone.
Honey? Leave it to the pros.
Okay, sperm donor number 03815, come on down! Okay, he's 6'2", 170 pounds, and he describes himself as a male Geena Davis.
No, that's all right. I just had a jar of mustard.
I know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish, but, were you planning on bringing up the whole baby/lesbian thing? Because I think it might take some of the heat off me.
Oh, we're having spaghetti! That's.... easy.
No, no, no, I don't make chocolate pies. When I was younger I-I enter in this pie-eating contest. I ate so many that just the thought of them made me sick.
You're not making the pies yourself?
Ross, Rachel promised it would be over by now. We seriously have to go, if we want to get to Vermont. I called them and the last train leaves in a half hour.
We used to be married, but then we missed a weekend away together and things kind of unraveled. Because of you! Happy Birthday.
Yeah hey, a weird thing happened today whey I was at brunch. This woman overheard that I was marrying you and-and then she...she wished me good luck.
No touch! No touch!
Any time you want. Y'know, when I was younger, all I wanted to do was to play with this dollhouse, but no!! It was to be looked at, but never played with.
Really?! Really?!
: he has to work, there's some rush on the big ah damn it one of these days I'm really gonna have to start listening when he talks about his job.
how come?
Oh good. Good, look I'm so sorry, for screwing up that cutting-her-out plan. But I have a new plan. Chandler agreed to call here in a few minutes with an emergency.
No.
Umm, I just wanna say, uh that with a pinch of exictement, a dash of hard work, a dollup of cooperation, we can have the recipe... Are you gonna kill me?
I'm so excited about having Monica come on board with us. Although I do feel bad about having fired chef Emillio, it's like losing a member of the family. Of course, that literally is the case for several of you. Tony, Carlos, Marie, please, tell your father how much we're gonna miss him. Now, I know that Monica has a lot of great ideas for this place, well, you all read the review. So without much further ado, I present to you our new head chef.
You know what? I take back what I said before. You keep playing at the restaurant, because with your music driving people inside, my bar sales are going up like crazy.
Ear plugs, or cloves of garlic?
Oh my God, it's gonna WORK! We're gonna make it work! I'm gonna be a mummy and you're gonna be a daddy! All right, I'll see you suckers. I'm gonna get me... A BABY!
Yes, but...
You say 'Thank you very much,' and then you buy me something pretty. Come on, we're gonna put are hands in this bowl, and we're gonna start squishing the tomatoes.
So when people complement me on my cooking should I, what do I say?
So, I went down to the post office, and it turns out it was those videos that I ordered for Richard about the Civil War. He loved the Civil War.
Yeah, I know, I sleep in the next room.
You know, Rachel, when you ran out of your wedding, I was there for you. I put a roof over your head, and if that means nothing to you... twenty dollars an hour.
Mon. I wish I could, but I've made plans to walk around.
Well, of course I do. What's not to like! I'll take her in a minute! But, you know, I think that you're giving up too easy, honey. I think that you need to fight for her!
Why, you don't like her?
For this weekend! Oh gosh, it would be perfect, we get to see Joey plus we get to start our anniversary celebration on the plane. We can call it out plane-aversary.
Wow!
It's great! How? Chandler. Well my boss and I worked out a deal where I only have to be in Tulsa four days a week, so the other three I can be here with you.
Okay, I have news. You don't have to move to Tulsa. You can stay here and keep your job.
So, I read this article in the paper the other day that says you're not supposed to throw rice at weddings, because when pigeons eat rice it kills them.
Aw, man I'm sorry . This must be very tough for ya, huh .
Lips moving, still talking. I mean it may not be ideal, but I'm so ready. No, I-I-I see the way Ben looks at you. It makes me ache, you know?
Oh, it's not the ideal way...
So I did tell you. Okay, y'know, that really isn't the thing. Umm, the thing is that, right now I'm just in a place in my life where I need to focus on me. Y'know what I mean?
Oh, yeah. Wasn't that like a year ago?
Tell him that you haven't seen your wife in a long time. Tell him that having a long-distance relationship is really difficult. Tell him that what little time we have is precious.
I know. You're right. I want to see you too. I've just got to figure out a way to tell Joey, you know? He's really looking forward to this.
Then you two can, can sneak into the cockpit, and things will start to heat up, and then a stewardess comes in... I've been watching too much porn.
I am a good kisser.
Look, I'm not happy about this either, but y'know if-if Ross says he's happy then we're just gonna have to keep our feelings about Emily to ourselves. Are you cool with that?
Yeah I know, we're losing Ross, Joey said hence...
Y'know what? You're right, I'm sorry. Actually you were a big help tonight. Yeah, and thanks for putting my grandmother in the cab and making sure she got to the hotel safely.
Monica! I'm not gonna screw it up!
This is Monica! I'm Phoebe's friend. Listen, Phoebe is back with David and he's going to propose to her, and she is going to say "yes" but I know she really wants to be with you!
Who is this?
Really? Weird. Anyway, see, I planned everything really well. I planned and I planned and I planned. It just turns out, I don't think I planned enough time to actually do it.
Actually, what I think you said was, "don't touch that, and get the hell out of my kitchen."
My God, I can't believe this! I mean I knew that mom and dad were invited, but I thought that was it! I mean from the ages 7 to 9 Frannie and I were inseparable!
No.
Oh no sweetie, no! This is my fault, I wasn't clear! I'm really sorry. And listen, you take as much time as you need to move out okay? There's absolutely no rush.
Oh my God! Oh, that's funny, I can't believe I did that.
What is the matter with you?!! Why aren't you more upset?! Aren't you gonna be sad that we're not gonna be living together anymore?! I mean aren't you gonna miss me at all?!
What is the matter with you?!
Maybe because you used to be aloof, or that you're really sarcastic, or that, y'know, you joke around all the time. Or that you take off your clothes and throw them on the couch.
What? What? Why?!
Are you still crying about your damn baby? Pheebs, you gotta keep the line moving, remember, 20 seconds per person. Your see these clowns all the time!
Oh, Monica made me send her to my mother's. Apparently babies and weddings don't mix.
I know that switch does something, okay? So-so I went down to city hall and got these. All I had to do was pay $25 and wait in line for three hours.
Okay, okay, okay should I be scared?
Hey! Joey said no autographs! But if she's gettting one, then I want one too: To Monica. And none of this "best wishes" crap. I want "love".
Where the hell is everybody? Bitter lady: Why don't you like me?! Chapter One: My first period.
Pants and a sweater? Why, mom? Who am I gonna meet in a blackout? Power company guys? Eligible looters? Could we talk about this later? OK.
Wow, you guys, this is big.
Great! It's so amazing! I mean, last time Dr. Roger came over, I was so nervous, but then after being with you I'm all like, "Can the doctor see me now?"
Yeah! Totally! Totally, and you?
Look, when it started I was just trying to be nice to her because she was my brother's girlfriend. And then, one thing led to another and, before I knew it, we were...shopping.
You were with Julie?
Anyway um, when he left he forgot to take the poem with him. Now, I am like totally dense about poetry, but I think it's pretty good all right. Check it out.
Well sure, you name a kid that, what do you expect them to grow up to be?
No, c'mon, we can't stop, c'mon, we've got three more pounds to go. I am the energy train and you are on board. Woo-woo, woo-woo, woo-woo Woo.
OK, stop.
Honey, you know I think you're hilarious! Come on, you know that joke you told me last week? The one about Jerry Lewis and the girl with the lazy eye...? That slayed me.
I do limericks... uhm... There once was a man named Chandler, whose wife made him die inside.
That's because I-I was just grabbing some things out of the dryer, and it's static cling. Or maybe it's just that God knew I'd be running into you and saw an opportunity.
You've got panties stuck to your leg.
So great! He showed me where the restaurant's going to be. It's this, it's this cute little place on 10th Street. Not too big, not too small. Just right.
The meeting with the guy went great?
You just told me that he hates marriage! That-that he's a-a complex fellow who's unlikely to take a wife! That-that he's against marriage and always will be!
Chandler loves marriage!!
Hi. Uh, my friend here was taking down our Christmas lights, and and she fell off the balcony and may have broken her foot or or ankle or something.
Ow ow ow. Ow ow ow ow. Ow ow ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow.
Please... Chandler is the love of my life... ... oooh leather pants! Have Mercy! Ross: So, eh... it's probably gonna be hard for you to leave Boston, huh?
Yeah, well, I guess I have forgotten about Joey and clearly you've forgotten about Chandler!
As a joke, this customer at work who has a crush on me gave me a $20,000 tip. His number is on the check, he just did so I'd call him.
What check thing?
Well umm, I was thinking that maybe we could come up with a system where we trade of being maid of honor for each other. Like hypothetically, if Phoebe were mine...
Okay, bla-bla-bla-bla!! Who is it?!
I'm a good person. And I'm a good chef, and I don't deserve to have marinara sauce all over me! Y'know what, if you want me to quit this bad, then all you have to do is...
Well that's not true.
We thought since Phoebe was staying over tonight we'd have kinda like a slumber party thing. We got some trashy magazines, we got cookie dough, we got Twister...
Okay.
Oh no, it is okay, I mean as long as you know that Chandler and I are also very hot and fiery, just as hot as you! I mean our flame, whew, is on fire!
God, I woke the beast. Sorry. I was wrong obviously, I just-I misspoke. It's okay.
Ross and Rachel don't know what they're talking about. I mean its not like their so responsible. Emma is a product of a bottle of Merlot and a five year old condom.
Oh? Did somebody miss me? Is there a child to raise poorly?
Oh, and the people are so nice. There's this one guy, Geoffrey, he's the Maitre D., Chandler, you will love him. He is without a doubt, the funniest guy I have ever met.
Awesome.
It was so wild. We told them we were the Gunnersens in room six fifteen. Only to find out the Boston Celtics had taken over the entire sixth floor!
Monana was very brave.
No, that's not it. It's just that when we were asking him all those questions before, I just... I just realized I don't care if he's the most perfect guy in the world... he's not you.
Why not, just because his great-grandmother was obese, our kids are gonna get that from you anyway!
Hi! I'm Monica and I'm gonna be singing "Delta Dawn""Delta Dawn, what's that flower you have on? Could it be a faded rose from days gone by? ..."
Just pretend they're not even here! It's OK Monica, when that spotlight hits you it so bright you won't see anyoneanyway.
And when I told her that I was gonna be moving in with Chandler, she was really supportive. You were so great. You made it so easy. And now you have to leave. And I have to live with a boy!!
Well y'know, I don't want you to be cold.
Do you wanna live outside?! Because it's gettin' cold! She gets tons of catalogs and umm, she'll fold down the pages of the things she thinks that I'd like.
Yeah and you stretch 'em out with your big old clown feet.
God, this adoption stuff is so overwhelming. There's inter-country adoption, dependency adoption.. There are so many ways to go, and this is like the biggest decision of our lives.
I do like fajitas.
Well, you're making him a frieze salad with goat cheese and pine nuts, wild nuts, wild rice, roast asparagus, and salmon au croup.
What am I making him by the way?
You guys are always hanging out in my apartment! Come on, I'll only use my left hand, huh? Come on, wussies! All right, ok, I gotta go. I'm going, and I'm gone.
Yeah, get out!
No, honey, in a wonderful way. You know what you want now. Most guys don't even have a clue. You are ready to take risks, you are ready to be vulnerable, and intimate with someone.
In a bad way?
Okay, I have looked through a bunch of career guides, photocopied and highlighted key passages and put them into alphabetical folders so you can make an informed decision.
I think she's gonna be the hit of the office, huh? She's gonna be hotter than peasant blouses and A-line skirts. Can I get a blue bow?
I know! And four ninety-nine for a pillow top queen set, who cares about the divorce, those babies will sell themselves. And I'm appalled for you by the way.
Oh, I cannot believe he's using our divorce to sell mattresses.
All right guys stop it. Rachel, we're very sorry that is a very insensitive thing for us to do. And y'know what? Let us make it up to you, we have two really great guys for you.
Yeah, y'know what I noticed Rachel? He scares easy. Is that the kind of guy you'd like to take to a ball? "Hey Sebastian, would you like to dance?" "Uhh, okay-I gotta go!"
No-no, wait! Just let me finish, okay? This isn't something that we just, we just impulsively decided in-in Vegas, this is something we both really want. And it is going to happen.
But I...
No, if he doesn't like our cookies, too bad, I am not gonna be blackmailed. Look if worse comes to worse, it gets a little warm, we'll call it a theme party.
OK, tip the man.
I think we are getting a little ahead of selves here. Okay. Okay. I am just going to get up, go to work and not think about him all day. Or else I'm just gonna get up and go to work.
Want a wedding dress? Hardly used.
Please ... if I win the lottery, you guys are not gonna leave me. Someone gave me a basket of mini-muffins last week and I couldn't get rid of you for 3 days!
Ok, well Monica, suppose one of your "special" tickets win? How are you gonna feel when you win the lottery and you lose all your friends?
Nooo! Okay. Whoa! Okay. See I was, I was a little nervous about turning thirty. So the bus boys took me out for some drinks. I wanna puke on you later!
Hey-hey are you drunk?
Oh really, so that hysterical phone call I got from a woman at sobbing 3:00 A.M., "I'll never have grandchildren, I'll never have grandchildren." was what? A wrong number?
I told mom and dad last night, they seemed to take it pretty well.
No! No-no they're not. They're still very angry! But y'know Chandler is also half-Swedish. You know what the Swedish people are famous for? Sitting down and being quiet.
Oh well, it sounds to me like your family is ready to uh, rediscover its Scottish roots.
Phoebe, you get the bear, uhm, Joey, you get the robot, and Chandler and I get the dog. Ok, and the race is going to go from here to here. Now the one who comes in last, stays!
I'm too excited!
Not until you said it. Somebody switch! Wait a minute... Ross and Charlie, Joey and Rachel, Phoebe and Mike! We're the only people leaving with the same person we came with.
You do realise that's your brother?
This would be a beautiful place to get married, yeah, but I wouldn't put the aisle there and I would never have the ceremony there! I mean you'd have the ceremony under this big beautiful arch.
I didn't know you could get married here.
Look, not that I enjoy talking about people who I went to high school with, 'cause I do, but umm, maybe we could talk about something else? Like you, I don't even know where you work?
...and then Zana, just let one rip!!
Ok, this is pumpkin pie with mockolate cookie crumb crust. This is mockolate cranberry cake, and these are mockolate chip cookies. Just like the Indians served.
She's not Rachel.
So what, you're not the only one. I mean, half the time we don't know where we're going. You've just gotta figure at some point it's all gonna come together, and it's just gonna be... un-floopy.
Yeah.
Look Ross, the only question you need to ask is, "Do you see a future?" I mean like do you see yourself marrying her? Oh my God! You did it already! You married her, didn't you?!
Okay, good stuff. Umm, well she's-she's sweet and pretty and...
Just, I love you so much. Just...It's just sometimes it bothers me that I'm never gonna have that feeling. Y'know when you meet someone for the first time and it's new and exciting? Y'know that rush?
What?
Uh, so, uh, Rach, uh... do you wanna save this wrapping paper, I mean, it's only a little bit torn... so are you gonna go for it with Ross or should I just throw it out?
I don't know, I-I guess I just had you pegged as one of those guys who're always 'me, me, me.' But you... you're a giver. You're like the most generous man I ever met. I mean... you're practically a woman.
That's Great. You know we don't need to talk about this now. Really, I mean this is, is so way, way, way, in the future, I'm talkin' hovercrafts and apes taking over the planet.
Look I want you, now.
All right. Op, here it is! Right underneath the can of-of bug bomb. I wonder if the best place to put something that cooks food is underneath the can of poison?
I want the little round waffles.
Me? What are you talking about? Nobody could steal me from you. I mean, just because I'm friends with her doesn't make me any less friends with you. I mean, you're my...We're, we're...Oh, I love you.
Yes. Monica, you don't get it. It's bad enough that she's stolen the guy who might actually be the person that I am supposed to be with, but now, she's actually , but now she's actually stealing you.
Okay, maybe this will make your teeth look less white. Nope. Okay, colors that don't work are blue, yellow, green, red, black, white, orange, and purple.
Ohhh.
You bet your ass I'm gonna fire you! Get out of my kitchen! Get out!! All right! Anybody else got a problem? How 'bout you Chuckles? You think this is funny now?
What are you gonna do? You're gonna fire me?
Well, I'll tell you what we're gonna do: We are already late for Phoebe's birthday dinner, so you point out put out that cigarette, we're gonna put this fight on hold and go have sex.
Then, I might as well ... do this . Not really sure what to do now.
Oh, he just doesn't want us to go through any trouble. Think of how excited he'll be when we go out and surprise him! Plus we get to have our own, ani-Vegas-ary! A-Nevadaversary!
Okay this is great, but Joey said he didn't want any of us out there.
Uh, Michelle. Yeah, that was me, I-I dialed your number by mistake. Oh, you're so sweet. Yeah, we were a great couple. I know I really miss him. Well, you know how it is, it's that....
I'll get it, okay. Hi, Monica and Rachel's. Yeah, just a second, can I ask who's calling. Oh, ew, it's Michelle! Ew! She, she must have that Caller Id thing. You should get that.
Okay, this is the den. All right, check this out. Lights! Whoa! All right. Less lights! Bad lights! Lights go away! Oh, see you just need to find the right command.
Whoa.
Yeah, I think we're ready for our first course. OK, um, these are rot-shrimp ravioli, and celantro pondou sauce... ... with just a touch of mints... and... ... ginger.
Let me, let me get you some wine!
Okay, Phoebe, y'know what? That-that's it, that's it, all right? No dinosaurs, no ghosts, no giant dogs, okay? They're not the right size, they're not Victorian, and they just don't go.
Okay, dinosaur attack!! Quick, everybody into the house!! Ahh-ahh! Roof! Rrroof-roof-roof!
It's okay. It's okay. Just pretend that it didn't happen! Okay? No one needs to know! I mean, Phoebe's not an official ballplayer! I mean, only official ballplayers can drop the ball!
Nah, I don't feel like playing.
I'm with you Chandler! I mean I can't have sex with a sick person either, that's disgusting! But I'm not sick! Let me prove it to you. We are two healthy people in the pribe of libe.
Don't take this personally okay? It's just that I just can't have sex with a sick person.
OK LET'S GET THESE CHAIRS OUT HERE! Gunther, hit the Christmas lights. Okay, who left the ice sculpture ON THE STEAM GRATE?
AFFIRMATIVE!
Well, because we want to get to know her better and she's never been to New York so she wants to see all the tourists' spots... you know, Statue of Liberty, Empire State Building...
So, why is Erica coming to visit?
Alright you two, I'm gonna go to the bathroom. Now I don't want anything going on while I'm gone. Here's a few things you can discuss: mucus, fungus and the idea of me and Ross doing it.
How do you think I got him in the first place?
See, this is why I told you never get involved with your assistant! And here is no such thing as keeping secrets when it comes to affairs. Did you hear that Chandler? No such thing!
Okay. See?
No! But because he thought I was to faaaaa.... And every time I think about it, it makes me feel as bad as I did in fifth grade! Y'know, I-I really think that you should apologize to Julie.
Because you kept talking to him while he was trying to go to the bathroom?!
Okay, y'know what, I'm not fine, I'm not. I mean how can I be fine, hearing you come in with her, she wants to see your bedroom.... Y'know what, what if we're friends who don't see other people?
Well, you seem fine.
I also, did a little something in fur. But umm, that's really just for me. Okay. So, why don't you go into your room and try these on and we'll see-get a better idea of what's gonna work.
Well maybe we just take that one away.
Maybe he's bothering you so much because he likes you. It's like in first grade when Skippy Langwild always pushed me on the playground because he secretly had a crush on me?
What?
I've been doing a lot of thinking. A lot! And umm, well, I came up with a whole bunch of businesses you can do with your van. Okay umm, you could be flower delivery person.
Okay, I'm hearing.
Oh my God! YOU FORGOT THE PIES? Well, I cannot believe this. You force me to make dinner, then you're an hour late and you forget the one little thing that I asked you to do.
Congratulatioooons!
I just wanted to say that I hope you do have sex tonight and I hope that you guys get back together, but I must warn you, the night that you announce your engagement I'm going to announce that I'm pregnant!
Yeah, you like that baby? May we help you?
You're supposed to double the tax. Not double the tax of Romania. I mean, what's-what's the deal? Are you, are you trying to buy me? Is this the way you get girls to go out with you?
Well, y'know, I never know how much to tip.
Oh, this terrible! Everything is destroyed! Look at this. It obviously meant enough for me to save it, and I don't even know what it is! Ohh, it's still soft. What do you think this is?
Yeah.
Level 1 alert. I repeat, level 1. This is not a drill. Okay we've got a situation. The minister just called. He's snowed in. He can't make it.
Well, I guess I'm in the wedding then. Ha haaa... He stinks!
All right, Rachel, I know-I know you think I'm crazy, please, before you tell him you love him, just-just try to find one person who thinks this is a good idea. Because I bet you, you can't.
I'm gonna do it.
Windows are clean, candels are lit. Uh, belt's to tight, gotta change the belt. Did I turn the fish? No, cause I made lasagne. Am I out of control?
Ooh.
Hey, wait a second. I can help you with this. You just need to be organized. We can make a list of your qualifications, and categorize jobs by industry. There could be folders and files!
But it's all so overwhelming. I don't know where to start.
Really? I'm really tired of being your relationship tutor. You're gonna have to figure this one for yourself. All right? Y'know what? If you're too afraid to be in a real relationship, then don't be in one.
Well, that's what we do. Y'know, I-I mess up and then you tell me how to fix it and then I do and then y'know you think I'm all cute again.
We have to do this. We are playing for women everywhere. Okay, just think about every lousy date that you ever had, okay, every guy who kept on the TV while you're making out...
Are we playing football or what? Come on you hairy-backed Marries.
Ok, trying to turn me on by making a mess? Know your audience! Besides, tomorrow we're doing those fertility tests and until then you need to keep your tadpoles in the tank.
Oh, well... Maybe we could...
Hey, umm, so listen umm, my friends were telling me a little about this ah, ultimate fighting thing and it, well it sounds really dangerous. I-I don't want you to get hurt, 'cause I kinda like you.
All right, on the table.
Hey Phoebe. Hey, tell me what you think. All right. The house next door to the one that we're buying in Westchester? Just went on the market. I wanna take a look at it, but Chandler doesn't.
I didn't say we were brothers.
And, and, and they wear those little water wings, you know. And they're, they're running around on the deck. Then Hoyt wraps this big towel around all three of them.
Yeah!
Chandler look, I don't want to be one of those wives who says, "You can't go to the game. You have to spend time with me." So, if you could just realize it on your own . . .
But hey, it's courtside. The cheerleaders are going to be right in fr. . . That's not the way to convince you.
Alright, you see these little flower blossoms? They should be facing up, not down, because, well, the head of the bed is where the sun would be. You don't love me any more do you.
Oh, alright.
Hi! If you're calling before Saturday, you've reached Monica and Chandler. But if you're calling after Saturday, you've reached Mr. and Mrs. Bing! Please leave a message for the Bings!
Okay. I'll be right there.
You don't know everything. Did you know that I'm going out with Rachel tonight instead of you? Hmm? And did you know that the only baby around here is you?! And did you know that I can't even look at you right now?!
Nah-uh! I know you! Okay? I know the thoughts that you have in the head--in your head!
Well,fall out of it. You know, you shouldn't even be here, it's a school night. Oh god, oh god. I'm like those women that you see with shiny guys named Chad. I'm Joan Collins.
Sorry.
Oh, stop beating yourself up! People make mistakes! These things happen! There aren't any message you've forgotten to give me are there? Apparently you're not very good at it! I...
I can't believe I did this! What an idiot!
It's not just the drum noise. Every five minutes, Joey throws his sticks in the air, and I have to hear, "Oh my eye! Oh god, my eye!" I mean, it is so annoying.
If you wanna give Joey a Christmas present that disrupts the entire building, why not get him something a little bit more subtle, like a wrecking ball, or a vile of small pox to release in the hallway?
I don't know! I don't-maybe you're feeling a little resentful. Maybe ah, maybe you thought you'd get married first! Maybe you can't stand the fact that your formally fat friend is getting married before you!
Monica, why? Why would I ever want to take away from your night?
Oh please! Dad turned my room into a gym 20 minutes after I moved out! I gotta say, a tanning bed and a stack of Victoria's Secret catalogues, not a gym!
They kept your room for a while.
Oh my God, me too! Oh! Oh, we'd be like friends-in-law! Y'know what the best part is? The best part is that you already know everything about him! I mean, it's like starting on the fifteenth date!
I don't know, I mean, this is just my initial gut feeling... but I'm thinking... oh, I'm thinking it'd be really great.
Well, Rachel wants to take swing dance lessons. Which I think is a really stupid idea! It's dangerous, she's never gonna get what she wants, and who knows who she might end up hurting.
What thing?
Excuse us! Alright here's a question: Who was so worried about her restaurant being fancy that she made a big deal about her friend playing her music and feels really bad about it now?
Ok, well, alright, who thinks the food is fine, the music was fine, but your evening was ruined by this incessant poll taking? .
Ok. Oh boy. You are doin' so good. You wanna squeeze my hand? All right, Ross, don't squeeze it so hard. Honey, really, don't squeeze it so hard! Oh, Ross! Let go of my hand!
Ok.
And when I told her that I was gonna be moving in with Chandler, she was really supportive. You were so great. You made it so easy. And now you have to leave. And I have to live with a boy!! TIME LAPSE.
Well y'know, I don't want you to be cold.
Aunt Syl, stop yelling! All I'm saying is that if you had told me vegetarian lasagna, I would have made vegetarian lasagna. Well, the meat's only every third layer, maybe you could scrape.
No-no-no-no, we're done.
Well, we just happen to go to alot of places where you might drink. I mean, how do you go to a wine tasting without having a drink? Or... or to a club, or to the... zoo.
Monica, have you ever been with him when he wasn't drinking?
And y'know what, I just realised, in the last year I've only gone out with two guys, Richard and Julio. You gotta help me out here, you gotta set me up, you gotta get me back in the game.
You are falling fast asleep. Deeper. Deeper. Deeper. You are now completely asleep. You don't need to smoke. Cigarettes don't control you. You are a strong, confident woman, who does not need to smoke. A strong, confident woman.
I can't believe I did this. I can't believe I'm singing for the people, and they liked me! Hey, did you hear thatone shouting "look at those tips"! I mean, did I really help you get a lot of tips?
Every little bit of you!
So, how'd the lasagne go over? Really?! Good. So you owe me three pretty things. Yeah, I've been thinking a lot about you too. I know. It's hard this whole platonic thing. It's a word!
Sure.
Yes. Well I got his machine and I left a message. But it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, because you know it was like a casual, breezy message. It was breezy! Oh God, what if it wasn't breezy?
Nooo.
OK, wait, wait, wait, wait. You know what? Ross, let's - let's switch places. You get in the middle. No un-, ya know, unless this looks like we're trying to cover something up.
Alright, shall we?
That is exactly why I do not lend you stuff!! Okay?! I mean, first it's my jewelry! And if it's not my jewelry, it's-it's my blue sweater! And if it's not my sweater, it's my sunglasses!
Okay, wait a minute. Wait a minute, I-I-I, I can't do this. Listen honey, this is, it's not Phoebe's fault. She lent me the earrings, and I lost it. I'm so sorry. Honey, I feel terrible too.
Aunt Syl, I did this as a favor, I am not a caterer. What do you want me to do with a dozen lasagnas? Nice talk, Aunt Syl. You kiss Uncle Freddie with that mouth?
Sorry.
All right. The super couldn't figure out what it did. A $200 an hour electrician couldn't figure out what it did. I've had seven pretty serious shocks. I officially give up.
Well, I then guess I'm going to Yemen! I'm going to Yemen! When we get to Yemen, can I stay with you?
What? Wait! Why? Chandler! Chandler! Wait! I'm sorry, I was just playing for one second! I was trying to find you to tell you that, look if you don't want me to see Richard again, I won't! He means nothing to me!
What does it look like? I'm going home.
It took me 28 years to find one man that I wanna spend my life with, if I have to wait another 28 years then, I'll be 56 before I can have a baby, and that's just stupid.
Well, aren't you forgetin' something? What, what, what is uh, what is that guy's name? Dad!
Well, I've tried everything. I give up. I guess I'm not gonna be the mom who makes the world's best chocolate cookies. I do make the best duck confit with broccoli rabe. Kids love that right.
Oh yeah-No, she was really nice to me, but she's in hell for sure.
Hi. About last night... I know you are under a lot of stress and even though the things you said hurt me a little bit... My point is, uh, well, I'm willing to take my job back.
Oh, man! I wouldn't have had breakfast if I knew there was going to be corsages!
I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! Hi, Tim.
Credit.
What?! Ross y'know this isn't even about you! I mean this is about Rachel and something wonderful happening for her. I mean you know even if you're right, what if he wants to sleep with her, does it mean he gets too?
Am I! Am I! Am I out of my mind! Am I losing my senses!! This dreamy guy is taking my girlfriend out for a meal.
Oh my God, oh my God, that letter is gonna go in our file! We're never gonna get a kid. No, we're gonna be one of those old couples that collects orchids or has a lot of birds!
Yeah, and don't worry. I didn't try to sound smart at all! See ya later!
Oh honey, we're close now but you-you wouldn't believe the years of-of nugies, and wedgies, and flying wedgies, and atomic wedgies, and.... That's where the waistband actually goes over your head.
So far, it kinda blows. I don't know, I just thought y'know that he'd feel more like a brother y'know, like you and Ross, just like close and connected and....
I can't believe this, just like 2 weeks ago I was watching Sudden Death, now I'm on a date with Jean-Claude Van Damme. Can you beat up that guy? Can you beat up that guy?
Alright, I hope you realize you're not getting these underpants back.
Oh, is that so? Ok. If that's really what you want, then here... I give you the headset. Well, I don't really want to give you the headset. Well I guess if you're taking over, you should probably return these messages.
Oh, well that's ok. I think you and I will do much better if you're just... here as a bridesmaid.
Hello? No, he's not here. Yeah, this is his wife. Yeah, well, it came as quite a shock to me too. I guess I should have known. Yeah, I mean, he just kept making me watch Moulin Rouge.
Would you get that please? People have been calling to congratulate me all day.
"Hi, it's Monica. I'm just checking in 'cause I got this message from you and I didn't know if it was old or new or what. So, I'm just checkin'. So let me know, or don't, whatever. I'm breezy."
Wow, what a cool job. 'You have two new messages.' 'Please, pass the pie.'
Fortunately, it is me. And, they made me head of purchasing, thank you very much. Anyway, I just ran into Ross and Chandler downstairs, and they think we should go out and celebrate. You know, someplace nice.
If it's not you, this is a horrible story.
Yeah. The great thing about the jam plan was, I was taking control of my life. So I asked myself, what is the most important thing to me in the world and that's when I came up with the baby plan.
Are you serious?
All right that's it, I give up! Whatever you want you can have it! You wanna sing a song? You wanna do a dance? You want your mom stand at the Alter and scream racial slurs? I don't care!
Hey! Uh, Monica? Chandler? Can I talk to you guys for a second?
You don't tell me what to do! I tell you what to do! Just call her. She's at the Paradise Hotel in Barbados. And while I've got you, you've got curly hair. What do you do in humidity? Damnit!
Look, if Phoebe wants to marry David, she should, I'm not gonna stand in the way of that and neither should you.
Come here! Come here! Sweetie you don't have to worry. No, besides y'know what? I'm gonna have a lot of new things with you. The first time we buy a house. Our first kid. Our first grandkid...
Well yeah! But now that I know that you're having these thoughts, I'm back to panic, anxiety, and uh I'm definitely gonna need some kind of sports drink.
I mean, why should I let them meet him? I mean, I bring a guy home, and within five minutes they're all over him. I mean, they're like- coyotes, picking off the weak members of the herd.
Nope. Schhorry.
You heard him! "No bigger!" "You're perfect!" "Just don't get any bigger!" Oh my god he sounded just like my high school wrestling coach. You know what? I'm going to have to talk to Chandler.
No you really think that's what it is?
No, I can't afford this either. No. I-I-I'm, I'm just to figure out which one I want then I'm gonna get it at Kleinman's, this discount place in Brooklyn, day after tomorrow they are having a huge sale.
Oh no, these dresses are all so amazing but there is no way I could afford one.
You went to one where you were popular, and you got to ride off Chip's motorcycle, and wear his letterman jacket. I went to one where I wore a band uniform they had to have specially made.
Okay, that doesn't help me, because we went to the same high school.
It was soo amazing, he is so sexy, and smart, which makes him even sexier. Oh gosh, I gotta so you this. Last night, we were fooling around and he stops to write a poem.
Oh, how was last night with Julio, senorita?
You know what, maybe I don't need to have children. You know maybe I just think I do because that is what society, and by that I mean my mom, has always convinced me that I... I do, I have to have children, I'm sorry, I just do.
Okay, last chance. Again, I'm sorry.
So Rach! You're the first guest at Hotel Monica! Umm, you'll just have to tell me how you like your eggs in the morning. And I thought I would bring them to you, y'know, in bed. Oh, you have been through so much.
Okay!
I don't believe this! Wow, look at this refrigerator! It's gigantic! I mean I could live in this thing! I'd be cold, but I'm always cold. Oh my God, look at these spider burners! I love spider burners.
Ohhh-hoo, funny story!
Okay, I umm, I ran into Richard yesterday and he asked me if I wanted to go for a bite and I did. The only reason I didn't tell you is because I knew you'd get mad and I didn't want to spoil our anniversary.
Simmons! Go with Simmons!
Please, don't listen to Joey, okay. Would you look at him? He-he's obviously depressed. He's away from his family; he's spending Thanksgiving with strangers. What he needs right now is for you to be his friend.
Have I been living with him for too long, or did that all just make sense?
Listen you guys, I don't mean to be a pain about this but, um, I've noticed that some of you are just placing them on. You wanna push the caps until you hear them click. Gunther, where're you going?
I'm sorry. See that's the good thing about my job. All the dinosaurs on my table are already dead.
I'm the hostess! Not those guys! I'm always the hostess! I mean, I was always the hostess, I mean even when I was little, I mean the girls brought their dollies to my tea party, I-I served the best air.
Why? Honey, what is the big deal?
All right, that I'll retract. But I stand by my review, I know food and that wasn't it. You're marinara sauce tasted like tomato juice! You should serve it with vodka and a piece of celery.
Well, you said that we except the Discover Card, which we do not!
I just ran into Dave and he told me that you blew him off! I mean, you listen to me! Now, I'm calling the shots! I say you leave Ross alone and go get Dave! What the hell were you trying to do?
Ohh! You did not drop any socks!
Okay. Could the waiters gather around to hear tonight's specials? Okay, first there is a Chilean Sea Bass prepared with a Mango relish on a bag-Why is nobody writing these down?
Yeah, people get pretty generous around the holidays. And it never hurts to wear tight trousers.
Okay, we're gonna start in the kitchen. Plates get put into plate protectors and stacked ten to a box. The silverware gets bundled in rubber bands and then bubble wrapped. Got it?
You couldn't be cool.
This is so typical. Y'know, we give, and we give, and we give. And then- we just get nothing back! And then one day, y'know, it's just, you wake up, and "See you around!" Let's go, Phoebe.
I don't think you mean that.
No! No, no... wait! We didn't lose. The rules clearly stated that the last one to cross the finish line was the loser. Well, our dog never crossed the finish line, so technically...
Yeah, see you later!
Right. Umm, listen since we're-we-re on that subject, umm, I just wanted to tell you that uh, well, I-I was going through a really hard time in London, what with my brother getting married and that guy thinking I was Ross's mother...
Yes! Good thing we have that, 'Not in New York' rule.
This isn't easy for me either. I wish things were different, I... If you were a few years older, or if I was a few years younger, or if we lived in biblical times, I would really...
Icky? You're actually gonna throw this away because it's icky?
Oh my God, it was the best funeral ever! I mean, everyone loved the food, and guess what? I even got another funeral for tomorrow-the dead-guy-from-today's best friend. I mean, it is like I am the official caterer for that accident!
Hey, how'd it go?
'Dear Dr. Remore, know that I love you and would do anything to have you.' Gosh. 'Your not-so-secretive admirer, Erica Ford.' Ooh wait, 'PS enclosed please find 14 of my eyelashes.'
Alright!
Let's see. Congress is debating a new deficit reduction bill... the mayor wants to raise subway fares again... the high today was forty-five... and- oh, teams played sports.
...And then he burst into flames.
Ugh, she's upstairs not doing the dishes! And I tell ya something! I'm not doing them this time! I don't care if those dishes sit in the sink until they're all covered with-I'll do them when I get home!
Oh. Thanks. Uh, has anyone seen Rach?
Yeah, yeah, it's interesting.. but y'know what? Just for fun, let's see what it looked like in the old spot. Alright, just to compare. Let's see. Well, it looks good there too. Let's just leave it there for a while.
I dunno.. I-I thought it looked better there. And I- and also, it's an extra seat around the coffee table.
No, you're right. Mnya, we shouldn't do it like this. Huch. For what it's worth, I'm, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have come down on you so hard about the smoking. So you had a few cigarettes, not the end of the world.
That was a celebration of life. Alright, look, I'm not gonna do this. Alright, is this really the way you want a baby to be conceived?
Honey, umm I-I love you, but umm, if you call our wedding a party one more time, you may not get invited. Okay? Listen, we could always earn more money, okay? But uh, we're only gonna get married once.
No, I realize that honey, but I'm not gonna spend all of the money on one party.
No, it is me! Y'know, I'm not just the person who needs to fluff the pillows and pay the bills as soon as they come in! Y'know, when I'm with her, I am so much more than that. I'm- I'm Monana!
Okay Monica, what are you doing? You're gonna lose your job! This is not you!
Yeah! I mean it was really funny, I-I just don't think you got it. You see Kara's coffee is-is-is weak tasting, okay? But-but what Doug was-was imply that it was weak physically. You get it now honey?
Really?
Hi, who's this? Hi, Joanne. Is Rachel working? It's Monica. Yes, I know I did a horrible thing. Joanne, it's not as simple as all that, ok? No, I don't care what Steve thinks. Hi, Steve.
Ok, Monica. I just have to know one thing. Did you go with her to Bloomingdale's? Oh! Ok, ok, ok, I just really, uh, I just really need to not be with you right now.
All right. Umm, you could uh start out with a little 1, a 2, a 1-2-3, 3, 5, a 4, a 3-2, 2, a 2-4-6, 2-4-6, 4, 2, 2, 4-7, 5-7, 6-7, 7 ...7.....7...7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7...!
Well, y'know, sometimes that helps.
All right. Umm, you could uh start out with a little 1, a 2, a 1-2-3, 3, 5, a 4, a 3-2, 2, a 2-4-6, 2-4-6, 4, 2, 2, 4-7, 5-7, 6-7, 7, ...7.....7...7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7...!
Oo, toes!! Well, for some people.
Okay, fine but please don't be upset! Okay? I was really depressed okay? And really drunk! I just wanted something stupid and meaningless. I just wanted...just sex. So, when I...went to your room that night...I was actually looking...for Joey.
Who did you originally want to hook up with?
Fine! Judge all you want to but, married a lesbian, left a man at the altar, fell in love with a gay ice dancer, threw a girl's wooden leg in a fire, livin' in a box!!
Hey, y'know, Mon, if things wrong out between you and Richard's son, you'd be able to tell your kids, that you slept with their grandfather.
Of course not. I mean gosh, Chandler what you did, it's, it's a wonderful thing and I really appreciate it. I know I have this weird thing where I want everything to be in the perfect place, but I'd never expect you to worry about that.
Do you want me to be afraid of you?
I'm going into business people. I'm sick and tired of being depressed about Richard. I needed a plan, a plan to get over my man. What's the opposite of man? Jam. Oh Joey don't! It's way to hot.
Because the kids need new shoes.
All right, I'll take one box of the mint treasures, just one, and that's it. I-I started gaining weight after I joined the Brown Birds. Remember, how Dad bought all my boxes and I ate them all?
Mon?
It's not like, I haven't any opportunities. I mean, y'know, I'm just waiting for the perfect guy. I'm seeing this guy Roger, all right? He's not perfect, but umm, I think maybe I should just get it over with. Y'know, give him my flower.
Yeah, I heard it.
You know what? This is not over. We will play you again, and we will win, and you will lose, and you will beg, and we will laugh, and we will take every last dime you have, and you will hate yourselves forever.
Mmm-hmmm. Oh, so typical. Ooo, I'm a man. Ooo, I have a penis. Ooo, I have to win money to exert my power over women.
No! No, she doesn't. Uh Phoebe, what she makes-that's uh-they're sock rabbits. They are completely different-Okay! Okay! Okay! I didn't make it! I'm sorry! I totally forgot about tonight and the fact that we're supposed to make the presents!
I see. Y'know umm, Phoebe makes sock bunnies.
Um, okay. You just called a little while ago about needing a signature on the admissions form. Well, it turns out we need a whole new one because uh, you see, I-I, I put the wrong name again. 'cause um...
Mmm hmmm.
My stock, MEG, it went up 2 points. Hey guys, do you realize that if I had invested my $127 in myself yesterday that I'd like have...a lot more than that today. Ya know what, I'm gonna do it.
What?
Yeah, well you call her and tell her that y'know when we were kids her precious little Frannie tried to undress me several times, okay? And if I hadn't have stopped her, there probably wouldn't even be a wedding to go too.
Well l-look okay, it's probably just a mistake. Let me call Aunt Sheryl okay? Maybe you are invited and the invitation just got lost in the mail.
Ya know what, I think I'm gonna go to my room and read Cosmo, maybe there's something helpful in there. Know what, at least maybe I can learn how to do an at home bikini wax with leftover Cristmas candles.
Yeah well, Ross just made plans for the whole century.
We have too! I mean what if Ross's hears that and then calls her back and then they get back together? Is that what you want? Ross back with that controlling, neurotic, crazy Emily? The Emily that wouldn't let him see you?
What?! We can't do that!
Well, if you hadn't meddled to start with, I wouldn't have had to go in there and meddle myself. Now, no matter how much we meddle, we will never be able to un-meddle the thing that you meddled up - in the first place!
Oooooooh! Meddler! Meddler!
So anyway, I'm cooking dinner for him Monday night. You know, kind of like an audition. And Phoebe, he really wants you to be here, which will be great for me because then you can 'ooh' and 'ahh' and make yummy noises.
Was it formerly owned by a blonde woman and some bears?
No, they gave us glasses with lipstick on them! I mean, if they didn't change the glasses, who knows what else they didn't change. Come on sweetie, I just want this weekend to be perfect, I mean we can change rooms, can't we?
Oh dear God, they gave us glasses!
She's this girl who used to live in the building before you did. Then she moved to England and she picked up this fake British accent. On the machine this is her message. "Monica, darling! It's Amanda calling!"
Who's Amanda?
Ok people, I want you to take a piece of paper, here you go, and write down your most embarassing memory. Oh, and I do ask that when you're not using the markers, you put the caps back on them because they will dry out.
Uhh, let's just stay clear of 'I'm the guy that's doing you daughter' and you should be ok.
Yeah, you were, but you decided to make salmon because you had some left over at the restaurant. And then you realised if you bitched about it, then you would stop cooking, and you would have to make your famous baked potato and Diet Coke.
I thought I was making him filet mignon?
I can't believe that this whole time we thought he hated us. I mean, isn't it amazing how much you can touch someone's life, without even knowing it?...Would you look at this dump? He hated us. This is his final revenge!
All right, there was none. Let's talk signing. You be noisy girl number one, you be noisy girl number two.
Yeah-yeah, y'know what? Yeah, that's it-that's it, everything will be mine! Nothing will be yours! That's-that's what I said! Oh come on, Chandler! I'm talking about the barca lounger! It just, it doesn't match! Where is it gonna go?!
Okay, I get it. So, I get nothing! Nothing here is mine! Everything here is yours! I'll get up in the morning put on your clothes, and head off to work!
Don't stare. Now she just finished throwing his clothes off the balcony, now there's just a lot of gesturing and arm-waving, , Ok, that is either, "How could you?" or, "Enormous breasts!" Here he comes!
How's it going?
See, I've been waiting my whole life to be engaged, and unlike some people I'm only planning on doing this once. So, uh y'know, maybe this is selfish and I'm sorry about it, but I was kinda hoping tonight could just be about that.
What?
Besides tampons and salt? Ooh! My God! Maple candy! That's so sweet of you. That's weird...it's empty! Ross: Hi you guys! what's going on, you... you guys wanna hang out...or...? do you...do you guys hear a buzzing?
I got you something from Vermont!
Okay, all right, how's this? 27. Italian-American guy. He's an actor, born in Queens. Wow, big family, seven sisters, and he's the only....boy. Oh my God, under personal comments 'New York Knicks, rule!'
Check it out!! Jam crackers!
Guys, hurry up! The flight leaves in four hours! It could take time to get a taxi! There could be traffic! The plane could leave early! When we get to London, there could be a line at customs! Come on!!
Total wuss!
Joey, I think you should consider something a little less risky. I mean, I think in this market, real estate is your best investment.The Fed. just lowered the rates and the interest on your mortgage is totally deductible. That's right, I know some stuff!
Yeah! Right! People eat birds... Bird meat... Now do they just fly into your mouth or you go to... you go to a restaurant and you say: "Excuse me, I'll have a bucket of fried bird." Or... or maybe just a wing or...
'Cause I was going by it the other day and I saw that there was a stock with my initials, MEG, on it and, well, sometimes I have to watch for two or three hours before it comes up again but when it does, it's pretty exciting.
Hey Monica, why are we watchin' the business channel?
A positive atmosphere! But I-I-I have had it up to here. From now on, it is gonna be my way, or the highway! All right? Does anybody have a problem with that?!! Hey new guy! I said, does anybody have a problem with that?!
Can't hear you!
Yeah, y'know, but something like salmon which would be so much more elegant than the chicken. And, you wouldn't have to worry about the salmonella. But of course with salmon you'd have to worry about the chickenella... So, I can't wait to see this place you're getting married!
Um-hmm! Doesn't that sound delicious at the last minute?
Oh, isn't he? Oh, you know, I really think this time it may work with him. I mean, he just makes me feel so good and I've been feeling so lousy this last couple of months, no job, no boyfriend. Well, at least my cup is half full.
Fun Bobby is so great.
No! Listen, I'm not gonna go through this with you again, okay. Just once I wanna beat when you can't blame it on the broken nose, the buzzer, or the fact that you thought you were getting mono. Let's just call this, tie score and it's halftime.
Woo-yay!!
Okay! Wait-wait-wait! Shhh! Okay, umm, I just wanna say that...I love you guys so-so much and-and thank you for being here on my special night. Our special night. I mean it just wouldn't be my-our-our night, if you all weren't here to celebrate with me-us-Damnit!
Okay, you get her in here. You bolt the door. I'll be in the closet.
They've only been going out for a few weeks and Phoebe is completely hung up on Mike! She'll say "No", David's heart will be broken, it will be too hard for them to recover from and then Phoebe will end up alone again.
I did! A penis one! Look, just so I know, what was so wrong about what I said?
Oh God, stop with the plan! So what, so what you saw him with a girl? Who cares?! That doesn't mean anything! Now look, you're going to go out on a date with Danny and you're going to be so charming he's gonna forget all about that stupid subway girl.
No, but I was doing my thing and everything was going according to the plan!
Why not?! I mean this has been the most amazing week. Would it be so terrible? Even if we were friends who lived together. Or, maybe someday friends who stood up in front of their other friends, and vowed to be friends forever.
You mean like exclusive friends?
Back then, I thought that I would never, ever get the chance to go out with a Chip Matthews, and now he's-he's called me up and asked me out. And the fat girl inside of me really wants to go. I-I owe her this. I never let her eat.
Oh my God, they told us that was for the mascot!
Y'know, let's face it, I'm not a kid anymore! I-I need to be with someone who-who wants the same things that I do! I mean coming to my place of work and telling me that you love me, I want that! Talking about pig sex over lunch, I don't want that!
Yeah! You're saying, you need to be with someone more mature. Maybe someone with, a license to practice medicine. Or a mustache.
This place is really my Grandmother's. I got it from her when she moved to Florida, otherwise I could never afford a place like this. So if the landlord ever asks, I'm 87 year old woman, who's afraid of her VCR. So are you thirsty?
Gotcha.
Okay, all right don't judge me to much. Okay? Um, but I saw this info-mercial, and um, I swear to you I have never-ever bought anything on TV before, except for this mop. But there was this stuff on leg waxing, it just, it looked so amazing....
Now what is Fabutec?
Oh how nice. Maybe later we can all go blow our noses on my wedding dress. Ross comes out of the guest bedroom with the diaper bag and the car seat carrying thingy.. yeah.. thats the techinal term.. He goes to Chandler.
Yeah we thought it would be nice to use the fancy china for dessert too.
I'm at work, ordinary day, you know, chop chop chop, sauti, sauti, sauti. All of a sudden, Leon, the manager, calls me into his office. It turns out they fired the head lunch chef, and guess who got the job.
What?
It bit. It was a 50's theme restraunt. I have to cook in a costume and dance on the counter. I mean I was a chef at Cafe des Artistes. I mean how could I take a job where I have to make something called Laverne and Curly Fries?
Hey, how'd the interview go?
You had a bathroom break at 2030. Pee on your own time, Mike! . Now, in regard to the toast, okay, you wanna keep them short, nothing kills a rehearsal dinner like long speeches. Okay. You just get in, do your thing and get out!
Do I have a minute to go to the bathroom?
Your boyfriend has been in there for over an hour. I can't believe it, it's like I'm living with him again. He's here when I go to sleep, he's here when I wake up, he's here when I want to use the shower, ughh. It's like I'm sixteen all over again .
What's goin' on?
Leon, Leon. Shhh! Guys. Wait, I don't understand. Those steaks were just a gift from the meat vendor. That was not a kick back. I'll just replace them and we can forget the whole thing. What corporate policy? No. Yeah. All right. I just got fired.
No.
That doesn't matter! We have waited so long for this. I don't care if it's two babies. I don't care if it's three babies! I don't care if the entire cast of "Eight is Enough" comes out of there! We are taking them home, because they are our children!
Monica, we are not ready to have two babies!
Oh. Well, I didn't realize that you needed it back right away. I mean, you told me to go and be a caterer. So I went. I beed. I mean, I... I used it to buy all this stuff. But look-I've got another job tomorrow, so I'll pay you back with the money I make from that.
I'll have one, please. Plus my money.
You're gonna find a place. But even if - God forbid - you didn't.. So you postpone the wedding. Is that really so bad? I mean, think about it. You could take all the time you needed to get everything that you want. You could have tulips, you could have salmon.... Mmmmm... Salmon!!
We can't find another place. Then we can't have the wedding! I've ordered chicken and salad and-and cake for 150. What should be the most wonderful day of my life is rapidly turning into just Sunday with a spectacular amount of food!
Hey. Oh good-good you're here! All right, I figured it out. I'm gonna take two tables of eight, I'm gonna add your parents, and I'm gonna turn them into three tables of six. Okay? And I called the caterer; I added two extra meals, we are good to go!
Hey.
Whoa-whoa-whoa, Phoebe you gotta take her! Y'know, I-I-I said some really bad stuff about her, but y'know Rachel has some good qualities that make her a good roommate. She gets tons of catalogs and umm, she'll fold down the pages of the things she thinks that I'd like.
Well, Phoebe that's fine because I'm not moving.
If it bothers you that much, just go out and get the shoes. No. Don't do this. This is stupid! I don't have to prove anything, I'm gonna go get them...But then everyone will know. Unless I get them, and then wake up really early and put them back! ...I need help!
She is a kook.
It is not over because she is going to call you and tell you she loves you. And the reason why she couldn't, is because her feelings were so strong, it scared her. Now you go home and wait for her call, she could be calling you from the plane! Come on now go! Go!
Okay. Good one.
I'm getting married!!!! I'm gonna be a bride!!!! No, I will not shut up because I'm engaged! Ohh, big talk! Huh, why don't you come over here and say that to me?! Huh, buddy?! Yeah, my fiancee will kick your ass! Come on, apartment 20! Apartment 20!
Oh no, let her stay out there. It's sweet.
Yeah! And if, and if we have a baby one-day, and the doctor hands it to you in the delivery room and you don't cry, so what! And-and-and, and if we take him to college and come home and see his empty room for the first time, and you got nothing, it won't matter to me.
Yeah?
Okay, but if we don't get this house, she's stil gonna show up wherever we go! I mean, at least if she's here, it eliminates the element of suprise. I mean, never again will you have to hear the three words that make your balls jump back up inside your body.
Will we love it so much with her next door? And she's gonna be louder out here too. Just the crickets and "Oh My God"!
You used to tell girls you were a Kennedy. Ooh, uh, thanks. Wow, little tight, isn't it? How d'you get a bigger table? You-you had a big table, but they made you move. Huh-huh, shut up Monica. Whoo, I suppose that Chandler will have the smoked duck.
I would never lie to get someone into bed.
Oh, gosh, this is so weird. I mean, his whole life was in this apartment, and now it's gone. You know, I think it would be nice if we just took a few moments, for Mr. Heckles. I mean, he was kind of a pain, he was, but, he was a person. You're all going to hell.
Yeah, yeah. Some people said some nice things about him. I think somebody should have it.
It's just, I think, there's never gonna be a right time to have a baby. I mean, now you're unemployed and in a little while you'll find a new job that'll keep you really busy. There's always gonna be a reason not to do this, but I think once the baby comes, forget about all those reasons.
I quit and you learn what I do?
Now, in some of these recipes, the quantities may seem just a little unusual, uh, like these coconut mockolate holiday nut bars. I've indicated four cups of coconut, and four cups of crushed nut, and only, uh, one tablespoon of mockolate.
I never know how long you're supposed to wait in this type of a situation before you can talk again, you know? Maybe a little longer.
Well, I thought this would be a great opportunity to use up all the food that I don't want to move to the new house with me! So, enjoy: smoke oyster casserole with a breakfast cereal crust, kidney beans in their own juices, and for dessert, a questionable orange.
Rock on! Phoebe : Wow, this is quite a spread! What is all this stuff?
With good news? Of course it is not good news, you just said "Doctor Connelly just called". If it was good news you would have said "Doctor Connelly just called! " But so what is it? Is there a problem, uh? Is there a problem with me or with you?
Doctor Connelly just called.
Excuse me, excuse me, hi, I'm Monica Geller..I'm the head chef here.. .. Ok, I was actually expecting a little applause there, but whatever! Ok, quick question: by a show of hands, how many of you were bothered by this woman's singing outside?
Get your garlic-peelers off me!
Okay, I've broken them down into categories. Okay, we have uh, we got holidays, birthdays, candids, y'know... And then what I've done is I've cross-referenced them by subject. Right? So if you're looking up, oh let's say birthdays and dogs, you get Photo 152. See?
Ohh, thank God! Finally!
Something went wrong with Underdog, and they couldn't get his head to inflate. So anyway, um, his head is like flopping down Broadway, right, and I'm just thinking... how inappropriate this is. Um, I've got something in my eye, uh, Joey, could we check it in the light, please?
Except it didn't. It happened to me. Oh, god, I'm gonna look like a big marshmallow peep. What am I doing? What am I doing? My father's right. I can't live on my own! I can't even do laundry!
No, a guy would be saying, "I'm never gonna get to sleep with anyone else." Oh my God! I'm never gonna get to sleep with anyone else! I've been so busy planning the wedding that I forgot about all the things that I'd be giving up! I mean, I...I'm never gonna have a first kiss again.
You sound like a guy.
All right, look, Ross. I realize that you have issues with Carol and Susan, and I feel for you, I do. But if you don't help me cook, I'm gonna take a bunch of those little hot dogs, and I'm gonna create a new appetizer called "pigs in Ross". All right, ball the melon.
No. Look, I told you I am not a part of this thing.
And-and-and if I die, from a long illness. And you're writing out my eulogy and you open a desk drawer and you find a note from me that says, "I will always be with you," and you still can't shed one tiny tear, I know you'll be crying a river inside.
Okay, well I won't uh, worry about this anymore then.
All right, that's a little sketch of the cake, umm some sample menus, umm y'know what I thought we would start out with Tuscan style finger food, and for music, here's an alphabetized list of all my CDs! I've highlighted the ones that would go really good with the food.
Oh, look at that.
She's living my life, and she's doing it better than me! Look at this, look. She buys tickets for plays that I wanna see. She, she buys clothes from stores that I'm intimidated by the sales people. She spent three hundred dollars on art supplies.
What?
Look, I know that you're in a place right now where you really need to hate Julie's guts, but she didn't do anything wrong. I mean, she was just a girl who met a guy, and now they go out. I really think that if you gave her a chance, you'd like her. Would you just give that a chance, for me?
You guys, um I know that this really doesn't have anything to do with me, but um I love you guys too. Oh, I really needed that.
I mean this has been like my dream since I got my first Easy Bake Oven and opened Easy Monica's Bakery. I mean I would kill for this job. I mean I can totally do this job, and God knows I paid my dues. But Pete's just doing this because he has a crush on me.
What a jerk! You want me to kick his ass?
Michelle, I only beeped in so I could hear my message. I mean that's allowed. Yeah-huh! I mean look, yeah, you know what I would really appreciate it if you didn't tell your Dad about. What do you mean, you're not comfortable with this? Come on we're friends!! That bitch always hated me. I'm calling her back.
You know what's weird. Donald Duck never wore pants. But whenever he's getting out of the shower, he always put a towel around his waist. I mean, what is that about?
Yeah, I mean yeah, I look great. Yeah, I feel great and yeah, my heart is not in trouble anymore! Blah, blah, blah! Y'know I still don't feel like I got him back, y'know? I just want to humiliate him. I wanna, I want him to be like naked and then I'm going to point at him and laugh!
What?!
Boy, I love carrots! Oh! Sometimes I like to put them between my fingers like this and-and hold them down here while I talk to you. Umm, and-and-and y'know if I get really hot umm, I-I like to pick up this knife and-and umm, I-I put the cold steal against umm, my body.
Okay.
Now, Mom, everything's going fine, really. Yeah, Ross is great. He's uh, he's in a whole other place. No, he's gone. No no, you don't have to fly back, really. What do you mean this might be your only chance? Would you stop? I'm only 26, I'm not even thinking about babies yet.
Help!
It's this dumb thing that Ross made up `cause he was trying to fool our parents. It's a way of giving the finger, without actually having to give it. I remember I cried the night you made it up, `cause it was the first time that I realized that I was actually cooler than my older brother.
Monica knows.
Y'know what really bothers me? Is-it's how-how different you act around them! I mean y'know the throwing the tennis games, the fake laugh, the "I'll see you around, Bing!" "Not if I see you first, Doug!" I gotta tell you, I don't like Work Chandler. Okay? The guy's a suck-up.
If we hadn't lost the game they never would've invented us to dinner tomorrow night.
Fair? Please don't even talk to me about fair! Fair would've been you wanting to marry me back then! Or fair would've been Chandler wanting to marry me now! Believe me, nothing about this is fair! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing!
I think that's fair.
All right, Chandler get the coats. Erica let's go. Phoebe and Joey, keep packing! Oh my God we're gonna have a baby. All right. We're gonna have a baby! OH MY GOD, WE'RE GONNA HAVE A BABY! Oh God, oh God, I got to sit down, I got to sit down. Ooh!
Yeah, you got to get to the hospital.
No-no, it's not okay! It's not! I mean you were just... You're so incredible! You went through all this time and effort to make this tape for me! Y'know I'm just gonna-I, I am gonna make this up to you! I will! I-I am going to cook anything you want in here , and I am going to do anything you want in there!
Oh, it's okay. I don't...
You are both idiots. The joke is not funny, and it's offensive to women, and doctors, and monkeys! You shouldn't be arguing over who gets credit, you should be arguing over who gets blamed for inflicting this horrible joke upon the world! Now let it go! The joke sucks!
All right, I've heard enough. I've made my decision.
I mean, all I'm asking for is just a little emotion! Is that too much to ask after six years?! I mean what? Are-are-are Rachel and I not as close as you guys?! I mean do we not have as much fun?! Don't I deserve a few tears?!! I mean we-we told Joey, he cried his eyes out!
And you're upset because you didn't make your best friend cry?
Ohh, wow! That's great! Oh wow! We really have to start planning! I have, I have a lot of really specific ideas! We should probably get together like four times per week. You can come over to my place; we'll get together before work! What do you say, 6:30, my place? I'm so excited!
Well, we just decided that Rachel is gonna be your maid of honor.
All right, listen up. There is usually only one dress in each size so when they open those doors, fan out. Now, this is what you're looking for! Memorize it! When you locate the dress, blow on these. All right? Three short blasts, when you hear it. Come running.
So this is Brooklyn.
Oh-ho-ho, sweetie, sweetie, you gotta stop saying that, now. It's no big deal, it's not even worth mentioning, you see we all do it all the time. See watch this, Ben, Ben, Ben. Ow, Monica bang! Everybody bang. Ben bang. Rachel bang. Bang, Rachel bang! Oh, isn't that fun?
Monica bang!
Okay, while we're waiting for these pills to kick in, I'm gonna sit you down on the couch. Come on. Get some nice soft pillows under your head, I'm gonna turn the TV on and you can watch whatever you want. And I'm-Sit down--gonna make you some tea. And then, I'm gonna rub your feet.
Oh no, I don't believe in Western medicine. No, if you just apply pressure to these points right here. Then your hand starts to hurt and you still have a headache, so thanks.
I swear, I promise. I promise. Oh my God, I'm so excited! {And I just can't hide it! I'm about to lose control and I think I like it! Sorry, just couldn't resist it.} All right, listen let me tell you, do not get her flowers. Okay? Because y'know, she cries when they die, and there's the whole funeral...
Tonight, but don't say anything. Okay?
Well, if you really think about it, I mean four days is not that long. I mean, I see you Monday before you go to work, and I see you Thursday when you get back, and I always work late on Tuesdays, so really if you think about it, it's really just one day. And well, if we can't make it one day, we've got real problems my friend.
What happened to 'you can't live without me four days a week'?
See? That's what I mean. I mean that, that's great! But I wouldn't trade in what I have for that. I mean I'm gonna be with Chandler for the rest of my life, and that's what makes me happy. Hey sweetie, come here! Come sit down. Hey Phoebe and I were just talking about how our relationship is deep and meaningful. It really is don't you think?
I miss you too!!!!
Okay, I was thinking we should have a beautiful guest room, right? With a mahogany sleigh bed and bedside tables with flowers on them all the time! And we could have a roll top desk with comment cards on them so people could say how much they loved staying here!! Okay, whatever, I really haven't thought about it that much.
Sure!
Ok, here we go. We need to sort out the tickets as quickly as possible to see if we've won. So does anybody have any ideas how to organize this? Ok, how about this: we divide them into 6 groups of 40, and the remaining 10 can be read by whoever finishes their pile first.
Ooh, you guys, it starts in like 20 minutes.
Ohhh, I knew you loved her! Then you need to go to the airport and tell her. You're probably just gonna catch her just as she's about to go to the gate. You're gonna call out her name and say, "I love you!" And she's gonna say, "I love you, too!" And you guys are going to have the most amazing kiss, everyone at the gate will applaud.
What-what is love really?
I know. Let's try a look...of far off...wonderment. Okay, we'll-we'll gaze into our future and we'll think about our marriage and the days to come. Chandler! What is the matter with your face?! I mean this picture is supposed to say "Geller and Bing to be married," not "Local woman saves drowning moron!" Hey! Don't laugh at him! He's my drowning moron!
Okay.
This switch thing has been driving me crazy. So I turned it off and checked every outlet. Now, four of them don't work. Which means, one of them has to be controlled by the switch. So, I plugged in things in all four of the outlets that-that make noise, so that way, when I turn it on I just follow the noise and find out which one it is.
Hey! What's up?
Hi, Nancy. Hi, it's Monica Geller. I'm good. Listen, I'm looking for a job in Tulsa. Well yeah, my husband has been relocated...Because I love him! No, I don't want a job in New York. Javo is looking? Oh my God! He asked for me personally? Oh my God! Oh, wow, this is really flattering, but I'm moving to Tulsa. Yeah, so if you would tell Javo 'I'll take it!'
Can I just say how much I appreciate you coming with me. When we get to Tulsa I'm taking you for a great dinner at 'Slim Pickings'. 'So Cheesy'? 'Whole Hog'? It's going to be tough to keep Kosher in Tulsa.
No, look, she's obviously unstable, okay? I mean she's thinking about running out on her wedding day. Okay, fine! But I mean, look at the position she's putting him in! What's he gonna do? Ross is gonna run over there on the wedding day and break up the marriage?! I mean, who would do that?! Okay, fine, all right, but that's y'know, it's different! Although it did involve a lot of the same people.
I don't think he's the one who needs help.
Hi, uh, Richard it's Monica, um, listen I did something kind of crazy tonight, um, maybe I'm getting my period or something, I don't know. Um, anyway, I, I, I beeped into your machine and I heard a message that, that freaked me out, and um, you know what Michelle will tell you the rest. I, I, um, I'm sorry, okay, I, I hope that we can forget the whole thing. Okay, bye.
Message erased. To record a message begin speaking at the tone.
How hard is it? No shoes on the furniture. Back to Monica and Chandler's apartment. Amy is sitting on a chair by the bay window looking mad. Joey groans and gets off the phone: The producer from Days left a message on my machine asking why I wasn't at the parade. They said everybody's pissed off at me.. And they all got to meet Santa!
You said that to me last week.
It is so weird, I know what I said, but uh, this morning, I was lying in bed I was, I was imagining what it would be like to say yes. I know it's a little sudden, and it's a little rushed, and it's totally not like me to do something like this, but that doesn't mean I can't. Right? I mean I'm-I'm crazy about Pete, and I know that we want the same things, and when I thought about saying yes, it made me really happy.
Oh, you so would! Oh, you should get that anyway. Like for clubbing.
I really like to say that I'm-um... Y'know what I'd really like to say? I'm drunk!! That's right mom and dad your little Harmonica is hammered!! And guess what! I've been drunk before! And I've smoked a cigarette! And I got a box of Ding-Dongs hidden in my underwear drawer! It's all okay. It's okay because I turned thirty today. And, and I can do anything I want! Because I am a grown up.
Wooo!! Hoo!!
It's gonna be really scary. I mean, god. When we have a baby, there's gonna be so much that we're not able to control. I mean, the apartment's gonna be a mess, I won't have time to clean it. What if the baby gets into the ribbon drawer? Messes up all the ribbons?! What if there's no room for a ribbon drawer, because the baby's stuff takes up all the space!? Where will all the ribbons go!?!
I guess. It's always gonna be scary when we have a baby.
Hello? Yeah, hi! Mrs. Tribbiani? Hi, this is Monica Geller. Yeah I'm just calling to say that Chandler and I uh, really hope you can make it to the wedding. Yeah, apparently a bunch of invitations that we sent weren't delivered. Umm, I guess there was some screw up at the damn post office! T-Tell me about it! Yeah, yeah, the US Post Office? No, more like US lost office! What are they Irish?!
I don't know. Just uh, just tell 'em it was a mix-up with the invitations, or-No-no-no! Blame it on the post office. They hate the post office. And the Irish! But I don't think you can blame it on them so...
Emily has probably been planning it since she was five! Ever since the first time she took a pillowcase and hung it off the back of her head. That's what we did! We dreamed about the perfect wedding, and the perfect place, with the perfect four-tiered wedding cake , with the little people on top. Thanks. But the most important part is that we had the perfect guy who understood just how important all that other stuff was.
I don't know. A month?
Chandler, for so long I...I wondered if I would ever find my prince, my soul mate. Then three years ago, at another wedding I turned to a friend for comfort. And in stead, I found everything that I'd ever been looking for my whole life. And now...here we are...with our future before us...and I only want to spend it with you, my prince, my soul mate, my friend. Unless you don't want to. You go!
Go on! Go on.
Absolutely! Now get out of here you!! Okay, I'm running out of places I can touch him! Look, is there something wrong with me? I mean why am I only attracted to guys where there's no future? Either they're too old, or they're too young, and then there's Pete who's-who's crazy about me, and who's absolutely perfect for me, and there's like zip going on! I mean, seriously, does it sound like something's wrong with me?!
So ah, we on for tomorrow?
Why? Because everything is my responsibility? Isn't it enough that I'm making Thanksgiving dinner for everyone? You know, everyone wants a different kind of potatoes, so I'm making different kinds of potatoes. Does anybody care what kind of potatoes I want? Nooooo, no, no! Just as long as Phoebe gets her peas and onions, and Mario gets his tots, and it's my first Thanksgiving, and it's all burned, and, and I... I...
Because!
Y'know, so I don't read as many important books as you do, and I don't write trick poems that seem to be about one thing but are actually about something else. And y'know what, I get excited about stupid stuff, like when I my People magazine comes on Saturday, and the new Hold Everything catalog. Y'know but that does not mean that I'm empty, I care about things. I care about my friends and family. You have no right to make that kind of judgment about me.
What?
Phoebe, that's how it starts. I don't need to eat the cake, I'll just smell the icing... why don't I just eat a little sliver, or, okay, just a slice or two. And next thing you know, you're 210 pounds and you get wedged in going down the tunnel slide. Phoebe, honey, I know this is hard. Look, if you talk to him, you're going to wanna see him. And if you see him, you're going to want to get back together with him. I know that's not what you want. Give me your phone.
I gotta call him. Just to talk to him, there's no harm in that.
