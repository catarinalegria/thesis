Well no, but um.
And it's not as if you have a boyfriend's shoulder to cry on.
You didn't know that already?
Let me tell you a story. When I set out to create Moss 865, do you think it just happened overnight? No. There was Moss 1, that burnt down my Dad's garage, there was Moss 2 that would only schedule appointments in January, and 862 others that I learned from, just like I learned from this fight, never to let a guy stand on my neck.
Why is everything different?
Uh-huh
Well, uh, he's a doctor.
So, who's the mystery man?
Alright, alright, alright...
You're right, you're right, it is...So you gonna invite us all to the big opening?
You're kidding?! That's great!
Ohhhhh!
Oh no no no no!
That's your new job, day and night, she starts crying I need you here.
What? It's still going on.
So-so how long did that last for you and Chandler?
Why do I have to decide?
Okay, okay. You have to help us decide whose joke this is.
No, I just talked to them.
You're wrong.
These are for Erica!
Hey!
I'm not your best friend?
Well, Joey's my best friend.
Guys, what's going on?
Sort of...
So, how'd it go?
Hey, Joey. Hey, buddy.
Okay, here's your penis!
Oh, you bet I am!
Here, let me try.
I'll call the super.
Why don't you just call her?
Hey, we haven't been on a second date, she needs to hear me pee?
I'm getting married next!!
Okay.
But my clothes are-ohh!
Hey, listen, why don't we go change in my room?
Just waiting for you sweetie.
What're you doing?
Well, it matters to me!
Oh, it's my wedding planner. She's driving me crazy! Hello... Hey, ok, stop screaming! Ok? So, halibut. All right, so salmon, either way. I don't-I don't... it doesn't matter to me!
How are you still single?!
Oh, I can still do that.
But we can go, right?
Yeah, I think we should see other people.
Is it a good play?
Oh my god, that is great! That is *** for a play on broadway... and in a real theatre, not that little one underneath the dally like last time.
Hey! How's it goin'?
Well, the heart wants what it wants. I'll see you later.
So I'm kissing everyone?
I can't kiss anyone.
I'm gonna miss you so much.
I'm sorry Pheebs, I guess I'm just really said that I'm leaving.
Well what did you send?
No.
What's so bad about that?
There're these two professors who are joining my department and I have to meet them here and show them around campus.
This doesn't feel weird!
What?
That's insurance fraud.
well, now, wait a second, who did I just put as my "In case of emergency" person?
What the hell are you doing?!
Right! So when Rigby got his samples back from the laboratory he made a startling discovery! What he believed to be igneous, was in fact sedimentary. Imagine his consternation when- Oh bloody hell.
What does she do there?
I don't think of her that way, you know, she's a, she's a colleague.
I mean really, think about it.
Well, I mean, are you sure you want to go out with her? I mean that ain't a pretty picture in the morning, y'know what I mean. That wig all in disarray, and boobs flung over the night stand, y'know.
Happy New Year.
Happy New Year!
So what'd he say?
No one was around to hear that?
We won't. 300?
Monica, I don't want to lose 200 dollars.
We're switching rooms.
Oh yes! Monica, get in here! There's a high-speed car chase on!
Oh, here's a great one.
I don't know what it is, I just can't take a good picture.
Sure! Okay, you go first.
Hey! Hi! You uh, ready to exchange gifts?
Ooh, this always happens.
I don't know what to say, I'm sorry. Though, you're not supposed to take these. It's like a million years old, we, we actually, we had people looking for that.
Shut up, I'm happy.
My baby sister, ladies and gentlemen.
Okay, umm, you're a loon.
Come on, you gotta admit that our relationship is ah, is hitting a new level now. 'Cause you used to be like the chef, and I was the customer, and now we're like this-this couple that fights.
Just subtract twelve.
Why, I must have been in missile training the day they taught that.
Who are you talking too?
Uhh, because I'm shooting a scene right now. Yeah, I uh, I play a gladiator. Uh, y'know what? Hold-hold on a second. Can we cut? Yeah, my-my friends are here, I'm gonna take a little break.
Did you just flick me?
Would you let me talk.
What are you guys doing here?
Oh...
Ah, the other Jack.
No, Jack and the Beanstalk.
What is the worse part?
Ah, I fooled around with Joey's sister. Well, that's not the worst part.
I thought she just had one.
Ya know, she's having another baby.
What are you trying on now?
Yeah.
Oh, well, I can move...
You can't move at all?
You're a really good kisser.
I know.
You have dinosaur checks?
Here you go, you can pay me back whenever you like.
So do them for free.
Oh, my first massage today is this incredibly gorgeous guy, and every time I see him I just want to do things to him that I'm not allowed to charge for.
The thing we never do.
Oh God! What was it? The thing that we hardly ever do or the thing we never do?
Oh, god help us.
Come on. This guy's great. His name's Bob. He's Angela's... brother. He's smart, he's sophisticated, and he has a real job. Me, I go on three auditions a month and call myself an actor, but Bob is...
Well, apparently she does.
Yeah. Yeah, but it was a really, really long time ago! Does she still feel bad?
Well, bye for me too.
Goodbye.
Hey, it's good to see you!
Hey-hey, hey! I don't know why I did that!
Thank you. They're yours.
Those earrings look really lovely on you.
Aww, honey I'm sorry.
I-I can't find anything that I want to eat! Everything I eat makes me nauseous! I'm telling you, being pregnant is no piece of cake-ooh! Cake! No.
Well you should be embarrassed.
Wow! Uh, this is kind of embarrassing. I was actually coming over to talk to your friend.
Oh my God it's old!
It's an old key!
Rachel locked the door.
Havin' some trouble?
Phoebe! Phoebe, open up!
Yeah that dog left!
How who wears it?
Would you relax? I know what I am doing. This is how he wears it.
Everybody get your toys!
That sounds more fun than the thing we were going to do in Vermont!
Wow! You are really fast!
Okay!
Alright, I'll be right back.
No, I'm okay.
That sounds like Nana.
No, I'd be hearing about 'Why didn't I get the honey-glazed ham?', I didn't spend enough on flowers, and if I spent more she'd be saying 'Why are you wasting your money? I don't need flowers, I'm dead'.
Rachel, how did this happen?
Ok, Paulo, why don't you just go get dressed, and then you be on your way, ok, bye-bye.
Fine! Happy Anniversary!
Fine with me!
Okay. Ow!!!!! Ow-oh-oh!
Grasp one of the linen strips by its 'easy grab tab' and pull it off in one quick pain free motion.
Hey! Did you find them?
Well, I can't do it either.
No. See you don't understand.
No come on. Come on tell me.
No. I hate this part.
Yes. Did you settle the bill?
Rachel, there's nothing in it.
See your twenty-five...and...uh, Monica, get my purse.
He took my snack!
Well you did pull his hair.
Hey, let me tell them!
Hey guys!
I mean don't you trust her?
No.
Oh no! What's the matter?
Hey.
Not at these prices.
Ugh! I don't know Monica. It feels funny just being here. I mean if you buy a bed from Janice's ex-husband, that's like betraying Chandler.
Oh, an old glove?
Nu-uh!
What happened to your teeth.
You know...Oh My God.
We all chipped in.
Oh my god, oh, you guys are great.
Do you wanna go hunting?
Ah, why, now I can't get a massage? There are so many things that she disapproves of! I can't eat veal, I can't wear fur, I can't go hunting...
Joey's bare ass!
Rachel... with handcuffs! Interesting!
Well, maybe you don't need them.
I don't know, I don't have my jammies.
: is everything all right?
DO NOT DISTURB DO NOT DISTURB! Monica:
Yeah. Don't do the dance.
Y'know, I sensed that I should stop. So we're okay?
Hey! Good, you're home!
Hey.
It's so good, isn't it?
Ah! Ahh!! Ahh!!
It's a diaper commercial.
Oh boy, I just can't watch. It's too scary!
Clearly we were wrong.
Whoo-weh hey weh-hey whoo hey!!
How do you know a mugger?
Yah, because Phoebe knew the mugger!
Put your head back.
All right.
I'm changing out of this.
Well, at least you didn't rent yours from a store called, "It's Not Too Late."
Oh no-no-no, it's still me.
Oh, it's good news. No, it's definitely good news. Hold on a second, I have another call. Hey, how's it going?
But we love our house.
Alright alright, we still have three hours till escrow closes on our house. We can still get out.
Pheebs, how's it going?
Ugh!
OK, um. Goodbye.
You too.
No that's, that's okay.
Uh, no! No! That's...art! If it bothers you I can put my art out.
Regular or decaf?
Yeah, sure, that'd be great.
I'm so glad you liked it.
Good.
Yeah, that's a big step.
Woo-hoo, first weekend away together!
I'm gonna start getting ready!
Y'know she might not even notice he's gone.
They've arrested Monica.
What?
The best man? Wow!
We met with him. Did he show you the photos of the nude wedding he did?
There were only twelve.
This is impossible Monica, why don't you just pick all 15?
Y'know what, I like Kathy.
Well, I think it's great that the medical community is finally trying to help sick hamsters.
Bye sweetie, I love you.
Bye, Richard.
This is all of your things.
Oh, umm, I'm just getting rid of a couple of things.
Come on, no peeking!
Okay!
Oh my God, that's Charlie!
God, you're amazing... I didn't even have to ask you to call me that.
Hey! I sold that to Joey.
GET THAT LEGLESS WITCH OUT OF HERE!
Then why are you laughing?
I'm not freaking out.
I am, aren't I?
You're the most beautiful bride I've ever seen.
Rach, here's your mail.
No, not even close. Forget Vail, forget seeing my family, forget shoop, shoop, shoop.
Huh, and no cuddling.
Right, fine, I'll do it, but no talking.
Everyone. Erica, baby!
Hi.
Chandler, sense the tone!!
Honey, there are like 20 tickets on the nightstand!
Oh.... my... God.
Bye..... ridiculously dull Bobby.
Oh my God! That's wild!
Nineteen Eighty Seven. The weekend you guys visited me at school.
...What did I ask?
Uhhhh.... he's not even wearing a jockstrap!
You didn't hear the speech!
Oh yeah yeah, thank God you were here to oversee all the kissing!
No really, they're OK.
You sure they haven't gone bad? You're sure they're not very, very bad?
Well, what about his family?
All right, kids. Here's the deal. According to my client's will, he wants to leave all his earthly possessions to "the noisy girls in the apartment above mine".
All right, check me out.
Oh, believe me, to survive this party, you're gonna have to come up with one too.
I don't feel good right now.
You're right, you're right. This is about your positions. Now, what I saw in the closet is not the optimum position for conceiving a child, although it might feel good.
So, are you ready to go?
Nice to meet you too.
Why did you hire me?
Hmm.
You did a minute ago!
I don't speak English.
One Two Three...
How do you count to five?
Chandler! What are you doing here?
Hey!
Phoebe, it's not about quantity.
Yeah well, "excuse me, I ordered the smoked salmon appetizer, but I can't see it, I can't see it"!
Y'know what? You are right?!
Oh my God!! Do it!! Honey, you've waited long enough!!
That can't be your father.
Gay!
Well, I was having a conversation.
Monica, can I talk to you behind my menu, please. What are you doing?
Can I ask you a question?
No problem roomie.
I thought that was a good thing.
One of the babies is kicking.
In...in two weeks.
Really?! Congratulations. When's the big day?
And he's a great brother!
So uh, Monica is Ross's sister.
Hi, nice to meet you!
I asked myself that very question, sir. Uh, this is Monica. This is my boss, Doug. Doug this is Monica.
Hey! You're wearing pants!
That's short for Phoebe?! I thought that was just what we called each other!
Or incredibly offensive.
Oh my God, I can't believe this is a real $20,000 check, oh this is just so exciting.
Ross, thats my jacket.
No, no. I mean, it mighta been at first, but by now I, I think I'm pretty comfortable with the whole situation.
Barry who you almost...?
Country club newsletter. My mother sends me the engagement notices for 'inspiration.' Oh my God! Oh my God, it's Barry and Mindy!
Well, thanks, we like him.
I just want to say that Ross is a wonderful young man.
Why, how much is that?
Ahh, I'd throw another thousand on that.
I'm engaged!!!!!! I'm engaged!!!!
Where is she?
What's fish hooking?
Yeah, anything goes, except ah, eye gouging and fish hooking.
Hello. Oh, hey Ross!
They got a breakfast buffet.
What!? You faked it?
That thing that I have to do to make a baby. I faked it.
It's Chandler! Are you OK?
Hey, it's me.
When were we not friends?
Oh! Gosh! This is brilliant. Gosh, it's just like old times. I'm so happy you two are friends again!
Yeah, but without the costumes.
Oh?!
Well, I hope you're happy!
You don't tell me what to do! I tell you what to do! Just call her. She's at the Paradise Hotel in Barbados. And while I've got you, you've got curly hair. What do you do in humidity? Damnit!
Yes! Have you seen it?
Waxine!!
What's wrong with PBS?
Ugh, PBS!
Phoebe, you don't eat animals.
Hey you guys wait! Guys! This place is so much better than London! Okay? This lady dressed like Cleopatra gave me a coupon, 99 cent steak and lobster dinner. Huh!
Worked like a charm.
Okay!
We only ordered one!
The next baby should be along in a minute.
Who the hell are you?!
Hey Mon! Hey Chann! Just gettin' a soda!
Was it really that good?
Hey, when the snippy guy sees the routine, he'll wanna build us our own platform!
Well you did a little bit.
Really! What is with that guy? I mean you'd forgive me if I fogged you.
Gotta keep squishing.
Okay.
Wh-wh-what are you doing here?
Hey! Hi!
Honey! Dinner's ready!
I'm really glad you guys are okay but, I just keep thinking what would happen if-if you two actually had hooked up.
Um, Pennsylvania Dutch.
You're kidding! I-I spent three years in Amsterdam.
What's with all this sand?
Oy!!
I am not high maintenance!
That's great. Good for you guys.
And that's Pete's Mom.
Hello.
Okay, what's going on with you?
Hey! Y'know what? Let's talk about relationships!
I can't believe you didn't tell me.
I might have.
Now, open your eyes.
Okay.
Let's get the show on it!
Hey!
Let's get you out of here!!
She does?
Alright, 5 more minutes.
You guys, just please.. a little bit longer. I promise, Rachel will be back with the cake any minute. Monica, remember.. the frosting? huh?
We're with you. We got it.
Okay. Okay, let's say I bought a really great pair of shoes. Do you know what I'd hear, with every step I took? 'Not-mine. Not-mine. Not-mine.' And even if I was happy, okay, and, and skipping- 'Not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not-mine'...
Alright, you wanna feel better?
With the web, the spider she dies, she does. She has babies and dies. It's like ya know, hey welcome home from the hospital, thud.
And Rachel. And that's Chandler.
Hey.
I'm not gonna go out with him.
Oh my God, Monica's gonna go out with a millionaire.
I wanna wear this everyday.
Oh my God Monica!
It's Monica, open up!
Who is it?
Oh, wait a minute honey.
It's not a blue screen... it's just, maybe it was just really clear that day. OK, I have to talk to my grandmother.
Deal! TIME LAPSE.
Oooooh!
Phoebe, you are a bad ass!
Whoa! Ohh!!
I would love to do it together!
Okay, great so do you want to do it together?
No-no, don't-don't-don't do it!
Monica...
Chandler, why are you doing this?
Ohhhh, I cannot look at it!
Thunder being stolen!!
You guys kissed!!!!! What does this mean?!! Are you, are you getting back together?! Can I sing at your wedding?
Oh, none for me. Thanks.
So how do you kids like your coffee?
Who, who are they?
Ok, off the top of my head... Don and Janet.
Oh my God, you're a freak.
Ok, I have to sleep on the west side because I grew up in California and otherwise the ocean would be on the wrong side.
Oh yeah, what's the plan?
Come on, it's not a big deal! We stayed up all night coming up with a plan so that us dating will not be a problem.
Phoebe, where's your purse?
Yes, it reminds me of a simpler time.
I got you the foot massager.
Well, actually it's just from me.
I can't believe it! I lost!
Mike wins?
Y'know maybe a little bit!
Absolutely not.
That doesn't seem fair.
...and then they came back from smoking and they had made all of the decisions without me!
Come on Rach, let's go.
Okay! Ooh-ahh, I'm gonna go pack. I'm gonna go pack my ass off!
Yeah, I'm sorry. I really am.
Are you really that busy?
What else did you think about?
Uh, four, a boy, twin girls and another boy.
It's hard for some people!
Monica couldn't tell time 'til she was 13!
Then why are you smoking?
I have the lung capacity of a two year old.
Ross, we can handle this.
What's all this about you guys fighting?! Is this really over a room?! I mean, that is so silly!
Well, you're not working either.
Okay! It's worth it, if it will get you moving. You haven't worked in months.
God, what is wrong with me.
Ooh. Oh. It looks like, like a tiny little person drowning in your cereal.
Look at you with all the guys!
Ok Monica: We will!!
Hell, I wanna see Joey.
Well, well um, you know, these movies are offensive and uh, degrading to women and females. And uh, and the lighting's always unflattering. And, Monica help me out here.
Ugh, I thought you were Rachel!
Hey!
Hey, Rach, how was work?
Hey!
So you had fun, huh?
Yeah. But Sergei said it took the Germans six weeks to get all the way across it.
Never done that before.
Hello. Hi sweetie. Good. Look umm, yes I've been thinking about that thing that you wanted me to do and, I can do it. So will you come to New York?
Wow! You made a profit!
Yeah, 15 hundred dollars.
It's almost our anniversary!
Hey!
Where do you want to start?
Yeah.
Does anybody want these?
Awwwwwwww.
Ow. Ow. Ow.
OK, now I'm gonna kick some ass.
Awww. But still no.
Secret? Married people aren't supposed to have secrets between one another. We have too much love and respect for one another.
How about Mockolate mousse?
Especially the after taste, you know, I'll tell ya, that'll last ya till Christmas.
I'll pick it up for you!
Yeah, but it didn't fit. Well, luckily there's a store here that has one left in her size, but I'm the groom, I'm not supposed to see the dress...
Oh, I'm- I'm so sorry!
Well, maybe that's because you spent four years ignoring me. I mean, would it have been so hard to say 'Morning, Luisa'? Or 'Nice overalls'?
Well, I-I-I-I... I don't know...
Yeah. I really hate to give her up. Oh, I know!! Oh, you should take her!
Hey, you've got a boyfriend!
This is so awesome! College guys are so cute!
I never stop thinking about it.
Is that what you're thinking about right now?
No, just a Friday night.
Oh, what was that for? Like a bake sale?
How was your first day?
Hey!
Hi, glad you could come.
Ok, ok! I'm gonna go hide! Oh, this is so exciting, my first mourner!
Well, she saw the ring.
OH...MY...GAWD! I am so sorry sweetie, are you okay? You didn't tell her we were getting married, did you?
You want some help with that?
Oh, don't thank me, thank the jerk that never showed up. Okay, I gotta get to get to work.
Rachel said everything was okay.
Nothing, nothing.
There's the man I married!!
Let me finish ... however, it doesn't look like I'm gonna get this job so I can't afford to have principles, so screw you, the tickets are ours!!
Y'know, just be there for her.
What do you mean?
So how does it look?
You're an excellent patient!
Look at you. All jealous.
Well, that's pretty much all I'm looking for from these people.
Here, let me help you.
What? Maybe I put it in here . Oh, oh, it's not in there! Oh, no! I must have packed it in one of these boxes!
Oh, now you want a pad.
Get the woman a pad! Get the woman a pad! A pad! A pad!
Yes, you're having a boy!
Wha-I'm having, I'm having a boy! Huh, am I having a boy?
You don't know military time?
Uh-uh. Ok. What time is that.
I highly doubt that.
Nothing. It's just old and dingy, that's all.
Joey, we have something to tell you.
Hey man, you feeling any better?
Hey Phoebe! Guess what?
Hey!
What is wrong with you?!!!
Aww, I love you so...
Is it the Italian guy?
You betcha!
So, did I hear Poconos?
Mma, Mma, Mmaah
See he's nice. Right?
Fancy soap? I thought we were savin' that for the Pope!
I know. Closing credits.
Well, we're gonna... we're gonna figure this out.
No Phoebe I am mad!
Okay, you guys. You guys I think I know what's going on here. Okay, you guys... STOP!! I know that, I know that you're acting mad because you think that it'll make it easier to leave. But deep down you're still really sad. Deep-deep down.
It's for their own good.
You're strict.
Well, what am I going to say?
Is it her fault that some of them didn't make it to you?
It's very interesting, Phoebe.
Oh, okay, it's the slide instead of stairs. Watch this.
Yes, he is. Me.
Oh, actually I barely knew him. Yeah, I came because I heard Chandler's news. D'you know if he's seeing anyone?
Oh my God. Richard? Hi!
I can help with that.
I do not have baby fever!
Yes! You want babies! You have baby fever!
I so wanna be attracted to you.
Oh, yeah. I know that.
Yeah! She's right in there!
Hey! Is uh, is she gonna be all right?
Hi Pheebs, what's up?
It's Paris, who knows we're here!
What are you doing with those?!
Sure.
He is right, isn't he?
I hate when Ross is right!
And who pays for that?
Uh, credit card.
Alright, here you go, sweetie.
Ohhh, OK.
Now calm down Joey.
What is he doing? What, Emily, thinks Ross's furniture has got Rachel coodies?
Well actually, Ross doesn't.
All right! So that's it! It's over! Everybody knows!
Because then I don't have to!
Wh-why is that the best part?
Oh well, it's not so bad.
Coming through! Oh! Coming through! Oh! Hello! Hi! No! Right! Coming through!
This is my favorite part.
Yeah do it now, call right now.
His dancing partner?!
That's not, prison lingo, is it?
Two thousand dollars?
Oh...how much?
His indian name?
And they were serving franks which is his first name minus the s at the end. And there was a rotisserie with spinning chicken.
NOOOOOOOOO!!!!! TIME LAPSE.
That's not even a word!
That was gonna be my opener.
Hey.
All right? What's going on?
I thought you were gonna be gone all day.
Yes that would be lovely.
Monica-Monica-Monica-Monica, listen-listen, listen, listen, would-would it make you feel better if we all stop talking about Ross and Rachel.
That's what you say about porn.
I don't know! It's not like it's porn! This is a serious, legitimate movie. Y'know? And the nudity is really important to the story.
Sure, I love this part!
Hey Monica, there's a customer who wants to complement the chef, should I let him in?
Why? Because of the government.
Why?
Yeah. That-that was the problem.
Oh, one other thing. Hoshi thinks that you being ringside may have affected my concentration.
You really think that'll work?
Y'know, it'll be okay. It'll be okay. Because when they come over, I will be all charming, I will make them fall in love with me, and then we'll tell 'em.
Ok, um, I'll go with you.
I can't, I have to take my grandmother to the vet.
If you want, I'll do it.
Oh my God, you guys, what am I doing? What am I doing? This is so un-me!
How'd the lecture go?
Hey!
Oh... what does that mean?
Apparently my sperm have low motility and you have an inhospitable environment.
Best out of three?
Okay-dokay, you've each won a game and I've lost what's felt like a year of my life. So everybody goes home a winner.
Is Amanda here yet?
Hey!
Joey?! Oh my God, Rachel!
I know! It's just that...ever since high school Rachel was the one person I told everything too. Y'know? I miss that so much now. She's my best friend.
Oh yeah, I totally agree.
...I'm telling you it's totally unconstituional.
You realize what you are don't you?
Drop off my dry cleaning. Pick up my vitamins. Teach me how to spell vitamins. Wear in my new jeans.
What are you smiling at?
You would not believe my day! I had to work two shifts, and then to top it off, I lost one of my fake boobs, in a grill fire.
Yeah, he's gonna work on that.
Rach...
Okay, it's ready. Come on.
He didn't turn me down! He's at the game isn't he? I got the date, I'm just not on it!
I'm sorry, my friend Phoebe...
The Empty Vase is not about you. My baby, you make me so sad that you would think this.
'I drink tea.'
Okay.
So, you're ready to do this?
Oh, okay. Hi new dad.
You can, I know you can!
No. No, no, I'm not ready! How can I be ready? "Hey, Rach! You ready to jump out the airplane without your parachute?" Come on, I can't do this!
Well, we certainly are alone.
Oh right, maybe I'll just go home.
Are you serious? Oh my God.
Isabella Rosselini.
Here's your tea Phoebe.
Oh, that sounds like fun, but we've got a ring to find!!
Hey, aren't you up next?
Thank you guys-guys-guys...
Oh man! I did it again!
You-you're not wearing a jacket.
Oh, did you catch him?!
Hey you guys, check it out. Check it out. It's like it's coming right at me.
He's gonna eat the cake!
What?
Really, is he a swimmer?
It's a name, yeah. I saw you, you know, in this great house with a big pool.
Let me ask you a question.
Ahh, that's what your Grandmother's hands looked like when we found her.
Rach, wait, I can cancel...
Ooh, this is a Dear Diary moment.
And what else is it not?
A place to entertain my lady friends.
This totally makes sense!
She's totally right! When we were together, you got all freaked out about Mark and there was nothing going on.
Just uh, do the right thing.
Monica, what should I do?
She will be after tonight.
No, no no no. You'll be fine. Hillary's bind, right?
He's retiling my floor.
What's going on?
Yeah! I bet I can do it.
Really?!
You look cute in bubbles.
Ahh, yes, I will have a glass of the Merlot and uh, he will have a white wine spritzer. Woo! Hey, look at that, the airport's moving. Hey, are we moving?! Are we moving? Why are we moving? Hey, time-out, umm, yeah, does the captain know that we're moving? Oh my God. Oh, my gosh.
What the hell are you cooking!
All right, all right, you're right, I won't do anything with Joey, I just thought that we Ok so that would be two cups of tarragon, one pound of baking soda and one red onion?
Then why did you move?!
Well, well, you said it was practice!
Hi, Chandler. There you are.
Is not.
Well, don't 'cha wanna?
You think you know me so well.
This isn't even my dress.
Yeah, I think we are.
Not as each other!
Definitely!
Oh, there's banana on it.
Hey, why are you mopping your ceiling?
We are not going to whistle.
We should do something. Whistle.
So, what are you saying now?
OK, look, this isn't the first time somebody's said something to me about this, but, I don't know... I always made excuses about it, like... uhhh... 'I'm just a social drinker,' or, 'C'mon, it's Flag Day.'
How desperate am I?
Could we be more white trash?
All right, so what do you say?
Ooh, I like that.
There's more beer, right?
I know I am. That's why I can't wear a digital watch.
Really? The scientist guy?
Yeah! I mean, I don't know. I was just , I was looking, I was looking in his eyes and I was just thinking: Oh my God! It's David. David's here. He's just, he's so irresistible.
Why don't you just get a roommate?
Yeah. I mean, it's been kinda quiet since Carol left, so...
I can't believe you're getting married!
Yeah! Yeah!
You stole them from me!
No! They are mine!
Oh my God, it was incredible.
Oooh, so so so, did you read the book?
You're plans were with us.
I have plans.
From here to the airport?
What about the time difference?
How about, you're moving!!
Well it's mine too! What else you got?!
Wait, he's not here yet.
Yeah.
That I was going to eat him.
Why? What was it?
What? Why, why would...
Please, please, please, don't be mad at me.
Well then get it, get it!
Wait, wait, we have a copy of your key.
That's a good call. Right.
Ohh. Um-hmm. But y'know, she choose to find me. I mean, I have to respect her decision. Right?
That is sooo not true!
Good luck. And I'm still right!
In case it happens.
Why?
Wait Chandler, what are you doing?!
See you later Mon.
Stick out your tongue.
Oh, somebody's feeling better.
Yes! Okay! Okay! Wait-wait-wait!
Okay!!!!!
So have you called her yet?
I am telling you, years from now, schoolchildren will study it as one of the greatest first dates of all time. It was unbelievable! We could totally be ourselves, we didn't have to play any games...
Why did they get divorced?
Yeah, but that just means that he was falling asleep on top of her instead of me.
You wanted it to be a surprise.
I am so sorry man.
Okay. Let's bring it in.
But wait a minute though, how are we gonna get there, though, because my Mom won't let me cross the street.
We'll be waiting for you...
Ohh! This is so exciting! Oh God... Come and knock on my door...
So um, who was she?
Oh shoot! Maybe next time. Thanks for a lovely evening.
I'm still all those things!
It was right after we were living together and you were driving me crazy, okay? You were really controlling and compulsive and shrill.
Excuse me Mr. Mexico.
Uhh, those are tacos.
Phoebe, it's been two days.
So long, Vic!
Did she leave a number?
Oh I-, Oh wait, Tony can you hang on? That's the other line. Hello. Oh yeah she's here but uh, can she call you back? OK thanks. Call Joanna. Hi.
I don't know what else to say.
All right. Now go see Miss Kitty and she'll fix you up with a nice hooker.
Chandler, where are your tools?
Interesting...
How'd you pay for them?
They're my new 'I don't need a job, I don't need my parents, I've got great boots' boots!
Alright, who wants to do it?
A psychic AND a wishbone? Guys! Give someone else a chance!
That's what it sounded like.
Did he just say, he loves Fonzie?
Okay. Don't you want a cookie?
Okay.
Well, we had a little fight.
Wher-where have you been?
Well, I just lost my erection.
I've got nowhere to go this morning. I'm unemployed! I don't know what I'm gonna do with my life.
Please, I'm not going for anything.
All right, I just got changed in thirty seconds so you can be alone with him. You'd better go for it.
Who wants it? Anybody?
I'll do it.
Yep, we wanna get married!
Hello! One marriage please!
I'm not a baby, you're the baby.
Well, she'll call back, don't be such a baby.
Oh well, where is he?!
Really?!
Scary pigeon's back?
I'm just going to wait for a little while.
Still smoking cigars?
...on the rocks with a twist? I remember.
Oh, So you can move them!
I didn't nail the boxes to the floor.
Would you like something to drink?
Thank you!
Oh, is everything in the car?
Okay, um, don't take this the wrong way, but your place kinda has a weird smell.
Just the matter of ...payment?
Dear?
Hi.. how was the game?
Yeah...
Oh. Can I have a tissue?
And the vet said it was time. And so from half a world away, while my Mother held the phone to his ear, I said good bye to my dog,. In seven languages.
But ehm...what is it not?
Alright!
That was the adoption agency...
What's going on?
Well, it just seems that...
Look, I don't wanna talk about it. Okay?
Yep! You got the tickets?
Hey! Are you ready yet?
Hey, did you stop by here?
Look, you know what, I'm sorry, but did you really think that this was going well? What's up?
Really? I don't really feel like it.
I think you know.
Oh yeah, what are you reading?
Ah actually, that is mine.
What are you barking at?
Come on robot!
And slept with the professor.
Hey, I think Elizabeth is a little more serious than, "Spring break!" All right? I mean she's taken my class!
Does it involve clogs?
Noo!
Does it involve travel?
I'm sorry, I just can't go to the hospital lookin' like this.
What were you doing in Africa?
Well I know I was an idiot! And I tried to forget you, I really did! Y'know after we had lunch last year I spent six months in Africa trying to get you out of my head!
Did you break up with her?
Julie Grath, my camp girlfriend.
You're so efficient. I love you!
Okay, all right, all right, all right! Okay! Okay, here's something, here's something blue and new.
I don't know, clean places?
Pheebs, if this guy keeps closing down all of our favorite places, where are we gonna eat?!
It's a... It's a boy!
Start pushing. Here we go. Here come the shoulders...
Maybe this wasn't your shot.
Y'know, I've done nothing but crappy plays for six years. And I finally get my shot, and I blow it!
Well...I'd better get going.
Yes...Yes..Uh-huh, You? We did you.
The baby shower for Phoebe!
Well umm...
So'd you guys have fun?
Yeah right after we stole his lunch money and gave him a wedgie. What's the matter with you, he's parking the car.
They're still in my coat.
Y'know, I-I gotta tell ya, those eye drops are a miracle. My eye is a 100% better.
Crematorium Chris? Sure!
So listen, you know my friend Chris who owns the crematorium?
But you told them you weren't?
Yep.
Ow, what are the chances!
Tails!
You just carry that around?
Hey!
It's 9:30 in the morning!
That's right! Where are the guys? I'm ready to get drunk and see some strippers.
Hey, did you pick a roommate?
Can I get a beer.
Some moms do that.
I know. It's just y'know usually when you're, when you're done with the pregnant thing, y'know, then you get to do the mom thing. I'm gonna be y'know, sitting around in my leather pants, drinking Tequila.
Chandler, this actually bothers you?
True story!
Oh wait.. What are you doing?
Arg... Alright, I'll take care of it. Monica and Chandler come through the front door.
That is so sweet. I love you.
Thank God, because I don't wanna do this either. You know, I was just doing because I thought that was what you wanted to do. You know, I'm the husband, I'm supposed to... bring the sperm.
We're okay. I'm still ovulating.
No!
How-how are you, Mom?
The doctor says it's a matter of hours.
I feel terrible, I really do.
Well that works out good, because I'm not listening.
So, did you two have fun?
Yeah, I saw the article on your coffee table and I memorized the title to freak you out!
I'm so glad you liked them!
Well, smack my ass and call me Judy! These are fantastic!
So-so there is no party.
That's right! 'Cause that would give him the control! So now he's all ooh, coming up with this whole I've got a party thing y'know, trying to get me to hint around for an invitation. Blew up in his face, didn't it?
THAT'S NOT ME!
Oh, good, good. Play more, 'cause I wanna see how it ends.
Wafer thin ice!
Umm, so this Aunt Marilyn is-is-is-is she coming to the wedding?
Let me get you some coffee.
Ohh.
Does it have to do with Joey?
No.
Ross, I thought you were over this.
Who's the bitterest man in the living room, the bitterest man in the living room? Hi, neighbor.
I was the pile of coats!
You were under the pile of coats?
Okay I'll take her, here.
Yeah I don't think dressing provocatively is going to help me here! Oh my god just please take her.
Hey, Rach, how's it going?
Oh, sorry, it's my phone. Hello?
Oh my God! Let me see.
Well, I was cleaning out the closet and I found some pictures of them... being used.
Yeah, we're trying to get pregnant.
What?
That was a terrible throw!!
Okay.
Too strong for me?
Yeah, not since I got too strong for you.
Makes me wanna puke!
That's fine, just don't bring it in my mouth.
What uh-What did you-What?!
No! I came here to tell you something else. I came here to tell you I still love you.
We are! Help us!
I know it sounds really weird, but we're just so bad at relationships.
Wow! Don't you look nice?!
Hey!
When did I sign for it?
I'm sorry, okay, I-I wasn't looking, and the store says that they won't take it back because you signed for it...
I know. I need more pie.
Oh my God.
I can't believe we're living here!
I don't know! But maybe if we keep that drawer shut, it'll die.
Oh, you are so great! Thank you!
Would it matter?
You painting his toenails?
What?!
I used to wet my bed.
And by the way, have I mentioned that back in high school, I was a cow?
Are you sure you wanna do this?
Okay! This is it! We're gonna get married!
You become friends after?
Friends first? That's interesting.
This doesn't concern you!!
Look, if I wanna see Phoebe and she wants to see...
You need to give him money.
Is this because of the burrito thing?
Ross's parents are my parents!
Well, I'm sorry. I thought parents were coming! Y'know? Your parents are comin'! Chandler's parents are comin'! Ross's parents are comin'!
We have got to wash that!
You are totally and completely 100% forgiven.
Joey look it's really sweet...
No-no-no! Look, I've been thinking about it. I'm an actor right? So I won't get nervous talking in front of people.
Ooh, are you gonna do magic?
All right all ready.
Why else would we be here?
Yes! Well that-yes.
That's not really how it works.
Ooh, babies! Oh, this one is so cute, get this one!
Yeah, but I don't think we have time.
Know what I mean?
Okay, now you're even cuter!!
Well, my Grandfather was Swedish and my Grandmother was actually a tiny little bunny.
Just some stuff for the party.
So whaddya got there Monica?
We haven't eaten yet!
Well, I'm gonna take a nap, turkey makes me sleepy.
Okay Marjorie, hit it.
Oh yeah!
Well, uh, I ate some.
Yeah, well, anyhoo, here is your check. Thank you for all the trouble you went through. Um, listen, you didn't eat a lot of it while you were cooking, did you?
Really? Your work laugh?
Oh, that was my work laugh.
Let her finish, doctor.
I don't think that's exactly...
Well, who's voice was that?
Monica, you don't know that.
What are you doing with the lamp?
Hey, you're early.
Oh, why? Why? What happened?
Not for me. Chip and I broke up!
NO, NO, NOOO!
You know, you should really look in a mirror before you call yourself that.
So! He'll understand!
Well, I have plans with Joey tonight.
Viva Las Gaygas!
Ooh. What is the name of Chandler's father's Las Vegas all-male burlesque?
So, where do you want to go?
Just one drink?!
What have you heard me sing?
But you would have so much fun and you have a really nice voice.
That noise you just made?
What?
How 'bout just a boom?
No! No boom-boom before big fight!
Wait what-wh-wh-what are you doing?!
Okay, I've been doing a lot of thinking about us, y'know a lot of uhh, us thinking. And uh, well I guess there's only one-one way to do this.
Um, I'm not actually Amish.
Yes necessarily! I mean, I dunno what it is, maybe it's the Amish thing.
Kiss him, you fool!!
It can't be any harder than this... I mean, If I had known the last time I saw you would be the last time, I... I would have stopped to memorize your face, the way you move, everything about you. If I had known the last time I kissed you would have been the last time... I never would have stopped.
No, I just, I fell down.
We just have to really, really, really, not let stuff like money get--is that a hickey?
Oh, let's not tell this story.
I know Monica's worst Thanksgiving.
Okay, I freaked out a little.
Yes you did! Admit it! You freaked out!
Your mother told you this?
That is correct! Yes, you're supposed to take all of that stuff and put it in a little box in your mind and then lock it up tight.
Two girls and a boy?
Sure you do, it was a gift from me. Oh! And you have these three great kids.
Or Spin the Bottle?
It's not Christmas!
I was in too much pain.
We were two miles from the house. Scared and alone. We didn't think we could make it.
You're not gonna mess it up.
So, if-if I mess this up, there's nothing else for dessert?
No, no! Give it to me!
Phoebe, where's your purse?
Why don't you just take it with you?
Okay, I'm gonna go to the bathroom. Will you watch my phone?
Sometimes I have bad dreams.
Okay, well it this bed isn't new, how come there is plastic on the mattress?
Ohh my God, I'm so sorry.
Uhh, Pheebs' Grandmother just died.
Does seem pretty perfect.
I think we've found our sperm!
The green dress? Really?
Yeah, my neighbor... Yeah, the brunette... She says you looked very pretty the other day in the green dress.
You really want me to come back?
Please?
Oh. Why didn't you take her?
So uh, Emily just went to the airport.
Chandler is such an idiot!
Oh, okay. Well, I'll just leave the door open and go sit on the couch.
We can't split them up!
Uh-huh! Join me, won't you?! Okay, what do you say we keep one, and then just like have an option on the other one?
Men are such idiots.
Good night.
Score! Now can we go?
Ok, just one more point.
We didn't order cake.
Here are your cakes.
You know, a party, or--
On someone's lips? Where'd you get the hickey?
Hi, I'm Ross's little sister.
Oh, this is Monica.
Oh, dad, turn it off.
Everybody smile.
IT'S THE HUMIDITY!
Hi David. Chandler. Monica... Oh!
Yeah, well they suck too.
What're you talkin' about, I was killin' 'em.
Okay, I think I get how to do this.
Pretty well. Except for the stapler thing. Little tip: if youre ever in a similar situation, never ever leave your hand... ..on the desk.
Nooooo. You're really not going?
See, he's her lobster.
Wow, you worked in a mine?
I remember the day I got my first pay check. There was a cave in in one of the mines, and eight people were killed.
Which one is which again?
Oh, my goodness, they've all gotten so big!
...and head to Canada!
There's no-one around. Why don't we just take this one?
Score!! 7 to nothing!
Go! Go! Go!
Hey guys! Dinner's ready!
Uh! That's a tough one. Oh! Wait a minute, this happened to me before! Yeah, I was auditioning for a play and the producer fell asleep and... no wait a minute... it was me who fell asleep... Yeah I mean hey, Shakespeare, how about a chase scene once in a while!?
So you didn't leave the bank?
Yes, I will tell her.
No-no-no, no! It's sensual!
Y'know, it's funny, but when we were studying communicable diseases...
How, how did that happen?
Cleveland.
Wait! Did you say 'G.Stephanopoulos?'
Wait, you're not 'G.Stephanopoulos?' Man, my dad's gonna kill me!
It's "Bolero" from "10".
What are you singing?
Okay well that's good to know.
Eh...
That's it! Dinner is over!
Well then you can't have any. Bear overboard! I think he's drowning. Hey fellows! Grab on a Sugar-O... save yourself! "Help! I'm drowning! Help!"
We checked. A lot.
Nono, she's gone.
Okay, we're gonna need a distraction.
I cannot push it in!
How? I don't have any money.
Look, why don't you just pay for it yourself?
Pete's breaking up with me.
Yeah, that'd be cool!
Hey, guess what I'm doing tonight.
Hey!
You're not just saying that are you?
Worse than when he broke up with Barbara.
I thought there wasn't a ball?
Yeah, sure. All right, whose court is the ball in now?
No you can't. She's yours!
Yes I can!
'Cause you invited your assistant.
How come we have one extra place setting?
Come here. Okay, be right back.
Oh, you should live with Joey, Roll-os everywhere.
She's in her room, why?
Where's Rach?
Why isn't it working out?
Well, I mean, then what happens if it doesn't work out?
Try feeding her again.
Good, good yeah, maybe while we're there, they can check your reflexes. "Oops."
Ten dollars an hour.
Oh... that's too bad. Bye bye.
Hey. It's him. Who is it?
What bank is this?
And well, what did she say?
I did.
Oh, so you like her too Chandler?
Unbelievable
But, I just cleaned the bathroom.
Well, I was kinda hoping we could do this without him. Oh no-no-no, leave the gloves on.
No it's not, it's second.
Uh, hello, it's third down.
It doesn't make any sense.
Some of the words are a little too sophisticated for ya?
Oh, no no no no no.
Perhaps, uh, the three of us, just could. . .
Wow, what's the bad news!
No, he really hates it. But he's gonna let me keep my box of human hair! So you got to pick your battles. But the good news is, Gladys is yours!
I can't tell you. It's a secret.
Hi sweetie. So, what was with all the whispering?
Pheebes, you know what I'm thinking?
Ironically, these are the guys who were picked last in gym.
You did it! You got ordained?!
Hey!
Could not be more terrified.
Afraid to ask him?
So, did you know Ross well?
I don't remember him, but then again I touched so many lives.
You know what? You can have mine.
It's not all mine. We all get 50 cents.
You know what? Let's not talk.
Uhh. You are welcome.
Yeah but I'm not keeping it.
Oh you got a wedding dress? That's great!
Dammit, dammit, dammit!
OK, alright, last minute lesson, last minute lesson. Joey... three... eight. Eight... three. Alright babe, deal the cards.
Lucky bastard! Janice.
OH...MY...GAWD!!!!
Thirty-two! Seventy-one! Hike!
Thank you! Break!
I'm a cool, fun aunt!
Hey you know what, this kid needs me, okay? She needs to have a cool fun aunt!
That's right Patrick, bye-bye!
Y'know what Phoebe? This isn't really worth the free massage.
Oh-ho-ho, we've got company.
Would you stop?! What is the matter with you?!
I'm gonna set them to my time.
You're gonna do what to my clocks.
That's that weird voice again.
Hi there.
You still work at the multiplex?
The movie theatre, you used to come in all the time.
Okay fine, now Ross...
Yes, but for the last time.
Oh, I'm gonna kill those guys.
Pizza delivery.
Nothing. I'm gonna take a shower.
What happened?
No, that is what the game is.
I don't have time for this.
Something to remember me by!
Wow! Mon, thanks! I love this plate!
Phoebe, stop writing about us!
"You wish."
007 gets all the ladies.
Batman has the Batmobile!
Because the winner gets this!
Oh really! Why is that?
Love is the best medicine.
Well, we are fond of the silliness, but we also have a soft spot for the love.
Pass the cheese, please.
All right, hang on!
Hi! Hey look who's here!
Oh, I'm sorry. I meant no.
Okay-okay, I got it. I got it.
I'm a lady Monica, I don't kiss and tell. But this hickey speaks for itself.
And I would have to say pah-huh.
Ok, question number 28, have you ever allowed a lighning bearer to take your wind? I would have to say no.
No, sweetie, I-I trust you.
Nothing?
Phoebe, what, what happened here?!
I know, the babies are asleep.
Did you just smell my hair?
Oh, you're welcome.
About a half an hour.
How long have we been home?
What are you the memory woman?
Maybe, because you told him not to.
I know, that's why I said again!
I already fed her.
Call us when you get there.
I love you.
I knew you didn't get a 1400!
Uh, he took the SAT's for me.
Yes? ..yes, she is.
Okay, errrr, Monica?
We're never gonna find anybody.
No, but Horny for Monica Minister called, wanting to know if we were still together.
Oh, wait, and I got a beeper!
Uh, lunch chef, purchasing, own little desk when Roland's not there. Here's to my little sister--
Well, I guess now we can't go.
Why did you look at me when you said that?
Oh, I ordered mine first.
Ok, Chandler, Mon, there's only one bananna nut muffin left.
So, should I call him back?
Maybe he's calling to say your obsessive and crazy.
Really? Who's number two?
Uh, yeah, I ah, I also need two.
Guys, we bought the tickets.
Me too.
And I'm going to go get drunk.
Ooh, Jack.... Sometimes I forget how powerful you can be.
What about your massage client?
Oh good, I didn't miss the party.
See? It's no big deal.
I don't like your massages.
I told you not to go down there!
What?! You got us evicted!!
Wasn't there a little song?
I've literally never been this happy.
Chip, is Chip Matthews.
Good runnin' into you at the bank today, so ah, here's my number, 555-9323. Give me a call. Later.
Oh great! Did you get a movie?
No.
Put all my money in me.
Do what?
Who? Is that your sister?
Oh, he brought her back to his apartment.
Not a basset, a bassinet.
Like a hound?
Phoebe, you'll catch pneumonia.
Okay, I wanna be sexy again so I'm trying to catch a cold. It should be easy, supposedly they're pretty common.
Then I've gotta go. Bye.
Well if you're asking me to quit, then you're asking me to be someone I'm not. I've got to do this.
Rach, did you check the machine?
I don't know, you might be the first one.
What?! You slept with Jason?
Oh! Oh! Oh! Okay, fine, fine. Now I don't feel so bad about sleeping with Jason Hurley.
All right, I guess we should go.
Hi.
All right, what's goin' on?
Not for you.
Joey! You didn't even know her!
Ohhhh!
Oh, he's catching up to her!
Oh, he sees her!
She lets you borrow them.
Oh yeah, good start Mon.
Please, guys, we have to talk.
Oh! That was Lambchop!
Nana liked it rough!
Monica's grandmother.
Soakin' up all the culture.
Umm.
You al-you already had it?
And then for forgetting to invite you to it.
He might still show up.
Oh. Oh I just cannot believe Clark stood me up!
Excuse me, where are you going?
Hey you guys, look, the one-eyed jack follows me wherever I go. Right, OK, serious poker.
You're right. Maybe I shouldn't go.
Honey, we're leaving tomorrow you've still got a lot of packing to do.
But Chandler lent you money!
Aww, I don't know Monica y'know... erm... lending friends money is always a mistake.
I used to love to play restaurant.
Well, I don't know what's in the boxes down here, but I do know there are six or seven Easy Bake Ovens in the attic.
Oh my god, what were you thinking?
Well, who's to say what's true? I mean...
Do you want me to pick you?!
Can I finish my story?!
You guys, I am not that bad!
Thank God you didn't try to fan out the magazines. I mean, she'll scratch your eyes right out.
All right, everybody open them!
You'll see.
Joey, you know you don't actually have one.
Oh, I've been there. Yeah, I am gonna go drive my Porsche.
Wow! She is pretty, huh?
Yeah, I-I-I'm down with that. Okay, here goes. How you a-doin'? It worked! She's waving me over. Okay, I-I-I'll be right over. Let's see, she's on the third floor...
Then I won't have to kill you.
I can do that.
Do you know anything about women?
Y'know what else I can't believe? I had to kiss Phoebe and Rachel every time I left a room, I mean it's too bad they didn't see us having sex.
Oh wait I forgot my wrap.
All right, what are we havin'?
See if he has ice.
So all we have is ice?
It might be kinda cool.
Y'know, we haven't found anybody else.
Yes, but we have to be fast.
Ooh, she's asleep, that means we can...
Okay, you come up with an idea.
That is a great idea! And by the way, I don't mean to sound distasteful, but when did you start crapping money!?
Bye... bye... BIRDIE.
Oh, time's up.
Hugh! Hugh Grant!
I meant female nudity. Alright? I don't need to see Lou Grant frolicking.
One-Mississippi. Two-Mississippi. Three-Mississippi.
Hike!
W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-...
Ooh! I found it!
You owe me 20 bucks.
We did?
Did you make brownies today?
When I was you! Y'know what, it's all Joey's fault, 'cause he left his nose open!
Just go get some! Go!
At this?!
Then why would he say it?
The guy was hammered, okay? There's no way, you look like Ross's mother.
Did you go home and change?
Hey. Ooh, look at you, dressy-dress.
I thought you could use the help.
I think I do! Thank you, Monica.
I-Is... Is that a picture?
So, these are the preliminary forms for an open adoption. There's a lot to go over, but I'll explain everything as we go through it.
... everybody we know? Yeah.
I see. You didn't happen to tell.
This is your current cellphone?
Yes.
Uch, you see, I'm ovulating.
Well, what is going on with you two?
You're kidding! Where? Where?
Oooooh. : Oh! I got an interview! I got an interview!
Is that a bit you guys do?
Yes dear.
Are you saying I smell bad?
No-no! No! I mean it's gonna be all smelling like Monica!
Aw, it's soo unfair.
I love you too.
That's right. Did you hear something?
Picking Rachel.
Hey Chandler, wanna do it with me?
Oh.
Okay, can we please go eat?
Yeah, I know, for a really great stew you just y'know, stick your head in between 'em.
Yeah I do rock that one.
Yeah you're always singing "Yummy yummy yummy, I've got love in my tummy"
Rachel! Let me in! Rachel!
I'll kick that door in if you give me a little sugar.
Why are so mad at him?
I'm trying, but man that guy can push my buttons!
Why don't you just go out with her!
Great job with the cups, Pheebs!
Maybe, do you need a tissue?
Sure? Thanks.
All right, I'll try not to.
Well, okay, fine, use my happy place. Okay, I'm just gonna, I have to ask that you don't move anything.
Ooh... she backed out.
What harpist? My friend Marjorie is playing the steel drums.
You wanna get out of my face?
Look, you wanna get off my back?
I'll get it! Happy Thanksgiving!
Monica! I think Rachel's here!
I'm talking about me having a baby.
What are you talking about?
Wh?! What about my allergies?!
Yeah okay, I was just talking to the guys. Just look at them I mean, is it okay if they come visit?
Ahhh! You are on my list.
You're a little high maintenance.
Hon, you gotta talk to Joey.
Youre not gonna lose him.
Oh, I can't pass for 22?
What?
I can't find garbage bags!
Oh!
Relax! It's Phoebe! Not you!
Right, because it's fast. Because, it's so fast. It's fast!
No, no, no, that's Dina.
Dark, big hair, with the airplane earrings.
Was your cabin pressurised?
So... Oklahoma is a crazy place. You know, they call it the Sooner state. Frankly I'd sooner be in any other state. And what's with Oklahoma having a pan handle? Can all states have stuff like that? Hey yeah, I'm from the waistband, Wyoming. But when I was seven, we headed over to the crotch.
Yeah, it's just something I picked up.
Wow! The new Playboy!
Honey, sweetie, by the edges.
Ohh, he's married! Ross is married. I can't-I still can't believe it.
Twelve dollars an hour.
No.
"Marriage. It's not for everybody."
"The phone. Bringing you closer to people...who have phones."
Hi, how are you doing Kelly?
Okay, it's a typical New York City apartment. Two girls are just hanging out.
You just wanna each take one?
Gimme them!
Hey, I thought you already had one.
And! They like me more just because I was with ya! I think you repaired a lot of the damage from when they met Joey. And Doug wants us to play tennis with them. He's never even talked to me outside of work. Except for that time when we bumped into each other at that strip club. Strip church. Anyway, I'm gonna go try and find a racquet.
Wow. Joey, how do you do it?
Wow.
I wasn't. Let's get going!
I was kidding.
The second sister dies?!
Okay, so how bummed were you when the second sister died huh?
Ok, you have to stop playing now.
You'd better get back in that kitchen Monica, the garlic is not gonna overuse itself.
Okay, you ready to open yours?
Okay!
Haven't we made this decision?
No-no, it's okay. But are we sure we don't want the waterbed?
What did I tell you about the hall?!
Yeah! Yeah! That would be very helpful! Yeah.
Hey, are we still on for tonight?
I promise.
Hey Pheebs, how's it going?
Okay.
It's too late for apologies.
Don't make me come up there!
We'll put buckles on it.
What makes it pilgrim?
Who wasn't invited to the wedding.
Oh God... well, it started about a half hour before the wedding. I was in the room where we were keeping all the presents, and I was looking at this gravy boat. This really gorgeous Lamauge gravy boat. When all of a sudden- Sweet 'n' Lo?- I realized that I was more turned on by this gravy boat than by Barry! And then I got really freaked out, and that's when it hit me: how much Barry looks like Mr. Potato Head. Y'know, I mean, I always knew looked familiar, but... Anyway, I just had to get out of there, and I started wondering 'Why am I doing this, and who am I doing this for?'. So anyway I just didn't know where to go, and I know that you and I have kinda drifted apart, but you're the only person I knew who lived here in the city.
So, what are we gonna do today?
Well, on the bright side, now you won't have to see all these paleontologists with their shirts off. Not you guys. You got it going on!
Oh, we're not seeing a movie!
Well, same thing we did all day, hang out at Gary's apartment. He is so amazing, we never left the bedroom. But have fun at the movie.
That's probably what they'll say.
Everyone thinks they know me. Everyone says 'Jack Geller, so predictable'. Maybe after I'm gone, they'll say 'Buried at sea! Huh!'.
Does that smell bother you?
Thanks Monica!
Well, you're not gonna get going are you?
What, look back?
Yep! And lot's of it!
Ho-ho-ho, fried stuff with cheese!
Why the hell did you take her?
Oh, we were playing "peek-a-boo." She just - she loves it when I'm dramatic.
We didn't give you any money!
That's right! I helped you guys out a lot in the start of your relationship. Huh? I helped you guys sneak around for like six months, and I looked like an idiot! And I was humiliated. And I only made 200 dollars!
Sweety, what are you talking about?
I found a dried up seashores.
Oh, we're not doing that. Okay...
What happened to the intimate dinner party?
Yeah, okay, give that a try!
Okay, okay, but Rachel's gonna be here too, can't I just ask her this stuff?
Oh my God, we're gonna be parents!
Yeah.
Yeah, I think you should keep looking!
Well, you couldn't have looked everywhere or else you would've found her!
Hey Joey, sweetie, taste this.
Yeah, I didn't know you guys were going to be here.
This woman's living my life.
Oh, Monica. You are not still going over that thing.
Uh, where do you think you're going?
All right, I think I'm gonna head out.
Okay, if you really wanna have sex...
Well that was before all the vaporizing action.
Yes, they can stay with us.
Wow! Oh-okay, look pal, I am not in the mood to be hit on right now! But if you give me your number I will call you some other time.
Ooh...hey honey, are you all right?
Ohhhh
Hey, what did you guys do today?
Hi!
Sure, what do you have in mind?
Now that I untangled you, how 'bout you doing a little something for me?
Well, that's it. Everything's packed.
I'm sorry.
Wh-what are we gonna tell him?
That was one of the worse things ever. And not just on TV.
Is he gonna introduce us?
Oh, no, it's no big deal, I mean, if I weren't doing this I'd just, you know, be at the gym working out.
We're switching rooms again.
Half a tank? We still got a lot of high-speed chasing to do!
I can't believe you let them win!
Long!
I can't believe this. Rachel and Joey?
What? Ross and Charlie? Wow! She's really making her way through the group, huh? Ah, who am I to talk?
Really? If that's what you want...
Unless... Maybe it's too crazy about this... Alright so... you know, there is no future... but that doesn't mean we still can't have fun. You know what? Forget what I said.
Oh! So you think I'm a failure!
That that's ridiculous! I don't feel guilty for her failures!
Oh my God! Are-are you crying?
You're welcome.
So she's a woman! So what?
Yeah, is Sidney there? Oh, this is? Sidney's a woman.
I'll get back to my new job.
Okay.
So-so you would've just lied?
No! That was a lie! See how easy that was?
What is it?! What about Pete?
No!
Oh my God, what are you gonna do?!
I kn-I know! I know! Okay? And apparently tomorrow when I go in to meet the director I have to take off my clothes so that they can see what my body looks like.
Hey, you got me, put it in.
Hey Monica, what's on this video tape?
Well, you tell a lot of jokes!
Seriously?
Okay! All right! Let's do it!
Okay, then y'know what? Help me! I need help! I can't do this!
Oh my God! Kyle Lowder!
Hey! Hey alright! Hey, glad you could make it Thanks for coming.
But you live here! You know that.
She wants me to move to London.
Serve the ball, chump!
Should I use my invisibility to fight crime or for evil?
That was a half an hour?
Oh! Look at that, time's up! My turn!
Dr. Burke, it, it's me.
Ah, that's OK, come on in. Um, I'm sorry, is Monica Geller coming? I was told she was.
You're not gonna be phased out!
See? Yeah, you told me the story. He and Monica dated when they broke up they couldn't even be in the same room together and you all promised that you would stay his friend and what happened? He got phased out!
You start working on that list.
Oh my ... you think I'm a pushover. Well wait, watch this, you know what? You're not invited to lunch. What do you think of that? I think that's pretty strong, that's what I think. Come on, Monica, let's go to lunch.
Hey Ross. What's up bro?
Wow! Listen, we had a good run. You know, what was it? Four? Five months? I mean, that's more than most people have in a lifetime! So, good-bye, take care, bye-bye then!
Just go over and say hi.
Shoot, shoot, this is never gonna work! He's right there!
Phoebe, we lost half of them.
What a beautiful night to be running around the street, looking for tickets. And the wind sure made it fun.
Yeah, just like the one in the poem.
Yeah, it's a vase.
Hey, you wanna go to see a movie?
Hey!
What kind of karate is that?
Oh, excellent.
I've gotta get back in the game.
For what?
Oh my God, I was thinking four.
Four.
No one wanted seconds, right?
Ooh, Italian!
Yeah, but maybe we're just over-reacting.
I dunno, aren't there tests for these things, right?
We need to talk to you about something.
Hey!
Oh, look, he's waking up!
Hey, come on, you came through, you did what you had to do. That is very dad.
What, he doesn't like Josh?
It's Joshua.
Okay. Umm, Phoebe, you suck too.
Oh my God, he's not even appreciated in his own time. I would give anything to not be appreciated in my own time!
It's actually going to be just family.
Well actually uh, there was something we wanted to tell you about the wedding. Um, it's going to be a small ceremony. Uh, tiny! We're not even sure why we're having it.
You what? You said you liked them.
It's "Ride of the Valkyries" from "Apocalypse Now"... See, Here's The Thing The corn rose were really a solution to your frizzy hair problem. And now that we're home, we don't have that problem anymore, so if you think about it... I hate them!
Cause I already invited her.
Why her mom?
Yeah, it takes two incomes.
No, no. This will always be your place. It would be too sad. Plus, how much a month does it cost to feed Joey?
That's-that's not Phase Three.
I am totally picturing you with all those women!
I miss Rachel. No, my parents.
Sydney Portier? Hehheh.
And this goes for all guys?
Again true.
Hi, that's what I'm doing for Phoebe!
My friend Manny. I asked him to keep me away from you.
Phoebe, your liver is right here.
I have liver damage. Ow! Oh!
This is not the bed I ordered!
Isn't it cool! Varoom! Varoom!
Feeling a little better sweetie?
Tell him it's for you.
God bless you Chandler Bing!
You still want that baby?
No, I'm wearing a wedding dress.
Y'know it's funny I started it but, now it's scary me. So could you come out here please?
Hey, how did the audition go?
Excuse me, Ross, old friends catching up.
Yeah! Roses or Lilies?
Centerpieces!
OK. Just for a little while.
Because, you know, you don't have to. If you want, you could just take a nap right here.
What if I turn out the lights?
Yeah, let's just forget it.
Oh, you got the whole night, huh?
Oh, that would be Monica. Hey, listen, I wanna borrow a coupla things, Aurora spent the night, I really wanna make her breakfast.
It was a really beautiful service.
Well, don't we look nice all dressed up?...It's stuff like that, isn't it?
The wedding starts at six.
Ah. Yeah. Well look, the thing is it's the same day as my niece's christening and I really want my parents to be there in time to see me. 'Cause my part's just in the beginning I'm not even in the rest of the show-Wedding!
You gave her food poisoning!?
All right!! Okay, it was like four years ago. Okay, Ginger and I had gone out a few times, and then this one weekend, we went up to her Dad's cabin. Just me, her, and her annoying little dog Pepper. Well that night, I cooked this really romantic dinner....
Why do you want to see my hand?
Ohh, let me see it! Let me see your hand!
Don't you love the huge yard?
And the wiggle wharms and the zip zorps? What were the things you said?
Promise me you'll be careful.
Oh, believe me, I don't want to get hurt either. I'm being smart about this. See these guys? They're the best trainers in the world, and Hoshi here used to be a paid assassin. A house painter! He used to be a house painter.
I didn't take a pregnancy test.
Phoebe found your pregnancy test in the trash.
My parents will be so happy.
Yeah. Monica, I want you there in the front row when I win. I want you close enough to smell the blood. What do you think?
Ross, he's got the remote again.
Daddy... Daddy... Daddy, why whyyy would I sleep with Billy Dreskin? His father tried to put you out of business! ...dead!
Do you think he knew I was here?
Ahh, whoo-hoo!!
Stop it Chandler. I'm sorry too.
Hi, listen, I'm sorry about before. I don't need to have a game room. I mean when I was a kid I only played those games because I couldn't get girls, and now I can 'em-Now, I have you. Not-not that I think that I have you or think of you as property in any sort of way, I see women...
That thing is not coming in here.
Par-tay!
I'm sorry, idea time is over.
Ooh, I have another idea!
We just want you to think it through.
Yeah.
Shoot! We're out of soda.
Umm, where's my purse?
Third door on the left.
Well, I thought you liked doing it.
Anything larger back there?
There you go. So she dips into her savings, that's what it's there for. She's gonna be fine, and if you need a little extra, you know where to find it.
What a minute, what did he say?
Well uh, I went down there and told him that no one treats my friends like that and that he'd better come up here and apologize. I'll see you later.
Yeah, but at least I'm doing it!
You in the back, you're getting it all wrong!
Pete, can I get you something else?
Well, that shouldn't be a problem. I mean I work in fashion and all I meet are eligible straight men.
Yeah, come on, we can be guys!
Well, look, why don't you just, why don't you do your Phase Two strip club thing with us.
What? I-I said you had a-
I can't believe what I'm hearing here...
Rachel, the cute doctors are here.
Eat your fish.
Thank you Joey, thank you so much!
That's it! I'm tired of covering for you two! This has got to stop! Ahh! And tighty-whiteys! What are you, 8?
No. He's not a horrible guy.
Well good, good for you. You really think that Roger is the perfect guy?
He's totally flirting with you too.
Monica, please?
Name one of his books.
I'm telling ya! It's gonna happen. Next year it's gonna be you, me and the little Hemingway Bing. What, he's my favourite author!
Okay, throw it straight this time.
Me too.
I clunked your heads together!
... and...?
So, what do you think we should do?
Yes you do! This is your third divorce! You love divorce so much you're probably gonna marry it! Then it won't work out and you're gonna have to divorce it, divorcing guy. I'm so drunk.
Breaks your heart doesn't it.
Oh I'm sorry mummy's so sorry go back to sleep go back to sleep. Shh. Shhh! Go back to sleep.
Yes. But all the other ones.
No, 'cause he's yummy.
Rachel, what're you gonna say to him?
Yes! You're never gonna make it!
Oh, they-they sent me home.
Why aren't you at work?
Oh, I'm sorry. Can I get you something?
Oh, I have a headache. A horrible headache!
It's coming from the living room.
Maybe it's the sound of Ross climbing into my brain and stealing my thoughts.
All right, we should call somebody.
I'm tellin' ya, he hasn't moved since this morning.
Phoebe, you're gonna be with your grandma?
Yes, every single one of them.
Well then we still have a problem.
Sorry, I just don't like the idea of when I say, "I do," he's thinking, "Yeah, I'd do her too!"
I have to be up in seven minutes.
Hm-hmm, I told you! I can't believe that I've only got two hours before I call in sick for work.
I don't have her number, butt-munch.
Did you see me write one down?
I knew you were not okay with that.
No-no, that's okay, apparently there's a new policy where we don't have to share everything with everybody.
okay, Pheebs, theyre gone.
Alright, so, can we turn this off? Can we just make it... make them go away? Because I cant, I cant watch.
Sit down! We're winning!
Maybe I should go!
Would you stop staring at her?
Sure.
It's my New Year's resolution!
What are you, what are you doing?
Umm, can we see you ride it?
Of course!
Ross, I can't believe you'd do that!
Your parents caught Ross smoking pot in college and he blamed it on me!
Oh, thank you! What's going on?
You are beautiful.
So I got it when I was 13...
Did somebody sign your bra?
So you hit her in the face?
No, there is no Rachel Greep, but then this other girl overheard us and she was all, "I'm Rachel Greep! I'm Rachel Greep!" and he let her right in.
That's because I'm in front of them.
Nope.
Really? My God, he's really cute.
Oh my God! That guy at the counter is totally checking you out!
It was hard! Phoebe: Hey!
You took the same class twice.
Yeah, you have to go fight for her!
What?
Y'know which one was she again?
Yeah.
They won't take you to the vet.
Monica.
That's Phoebe! Where did you get that?
Oh my God!
Wow! That guy is so rude!
O-kay!
Weeeell, it's rum, and-
What's that?
I think I hear curtains closing...
Anything?
No, that landed in your food!
Girls, girls, stop, ok? We'll flip a coin. Heads, she's Rachel's, tails she's Monica's. . Tails! Monica, she's yours!
It is not over! You're over!
All right look, forget it, forget it. You told her you love her, it's over.
Mmh... this cake is amazing!
JOEY DOESN'T SHARE FOOD! end.
Okay, here comes another camera.
Because that's where Joey gave me some stuff to store that I've never seen before in my life! Okay, that did not just happen!
I do, but Rachel borrowed them.
Oh, I left them on my bulldozer... I don't have tools!
Rach, come see who's out here!
Ok, well, this was very special.
Okay! Oh my God, thank you!!
Okay.
Well, at least you scared someone.
Well, but aren't you pissed at him?! I mean this guy abandoned you! I gotta tell you if this were me, this guy would be in some serious physical danger! I mean I-I-I'd walk in there and I'd be like, "Yo, dad! You and me outside right now!" I kinda scared myself.
It's kind of an important one!
That's one?
Sweetie, I wanted you to have him too.
Ok, ok, ok. How did this happen to me? How did this happen to me? A week ago, two weeks ago, I was fine. Ross was just Ross, just this guy. Now he's Rrrooossss, oh, this really great guy that I can't have.
Friday's perfect...She can't wait.
Absolutely! Is Friday okay?
Oh my God! It's like one mind.
Definitely roses. Well, I just think they're a little more weddingy. But Lilies are the clear choice.
Yes, but you are dead inside.
Hey, I had a terrible childhood and I don't do porn.
What do you do with your money now?
Well, I'm starting to make good money on the show and I'm thinking... I should probably do something with it.
How's the big anniversary dinner?
Hey.
Hell no, we'll pay!
You know what, you guys? It's their first time, why don't we just forget about the money, alright?
Here, take a couple of these.
Oh my God, you've got to stop chattering!
Tell me about yourself, Zack!
Thanks! Do you have a coaster? I don't wanna make a ring.
They thought Joey was a child?
They thought it was very smart of us to have a child write the recommendation letter.
All right, I'll see you guys later.
A cool phone number, and a possible name for the kid.
Oh. Maybe they're- napping.
Yeah.
Chandler, you're not gonna die alone.
Ok, you win.
Electrical plans for the building.
What are these?
Chandler, I'm gonna die a virgin!
Hey that's what I tell girls about me.
Rach, he's a friend of ours.
Oh my God! Joey Tribbiani from Days of Our Lives, just walked in here!
Oh, but it's made her so happy.
Yes, we have to tell her!
Okay, he's a senior in college.
When we were?
Oh, I'm sorry, mrs Hannigan.
Oh, not anymore. I changed it today.
Yeah, he's just gotta get a shot.
Is he gonna be ok?
You were going to cut me out?
No I distinctly remember you were dodging her calls and trying to avoid seeing her.
Wait, did you know it was twins?
Well, gosh. That makes me feel so special and good.
I have no idea what you just said.
I'm trppd... in an ATM vstbl... wth Jll Gdcr!
About a week and a half.
Oh my God! How long has she been crying?
Oh, look at these little bunnies!
Have fun at church-camp!
Come here, I'll make you a drink.
No, no, no. It's ok. I'm gonna be fine.
"I'm a little bit country"...
Oh God, that's right. I blocked that out.
Really, you want to wait a year?
Or a year?
Joey's gonna be *so* upset.
Yeah, she was just an agent.
They have racquets don't they?!
You're not even giving them a chance!
Ross, cough drops, please?
I mean y'know, I'm thinking. You could bring her, and you guys could go up to your old room, and not make out.
As much as they love you?
Come on, you know they love you.
Phoebe, can I talk to you for a second?
Uh no, I have to go in a few hours. I have to be on the red-eye. Well listen, y'know, next time you're in Minsk umm...
All right, I...I have to ask.
I would really love it if could do both.
That's so sweet. Find anything?
Looking for restaurant jobs for you in Tulsa.
I'm sorry, I'll give it back to you.
Well uh, it's just that uh, y'know if-if you're gonna be wearing someone's sweatshirt shouldn't it be your boyfriends--and I'm not him.
Oop, your cake is ready!
No you don't-get it in black, not brown.
Whoa!!! Are you kidding me?!
Well, close to...
I wanna watch Entertainment Tonight.
Well what's the difference? Your eggs aren't here anymore, are they? You took your eggs and you left. You really expect me to never find new eggs?
Okay that does sound like fun.
Hey, y'know what we can do? Y'know, now that we are up? We can just like talk to each other all night long, y'know like we did when we were first going out. It'd be fun!
Hey honey! I missed you today!
But I am going hunting!!
Really? I only had two glasses.
We went through a lot of wine tonight, you guys.
I can't be fair. You're my boyfriend.
Yeah.
Yes!! Yes! Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Monica, uh Dad called this morning and ah, Aunt Silvia passed away.
Who are they killing off?
It's winter, they are fewer people on the street.
Oh my God. He threw up?
So, Ross and I are going to Disneyland and we stop at this restaurant for tacos. And when I say restaurant, I mean a guy, a hibachi, and the trunk of his car. So Ross has about 10 tacos. And anyway, we're on Space Mountain and Ross starts to feel a little iffy.
Yeah, what, do you think we're stupid?
Oh, come on! We know what these are worth.
No, you are not. We tell you stuff.
This is so typical. I'm always the last one to know everything.
Rachel, get the book! The book!
No. It's all right; it's probably false labour. They said that, that can happen near the end, just somebody get the book.
I am so glad you said cooks.
Have you kissed her yet? It's awesome! I could do it forever! Y'know what? She-she kisses better than my mom cooks!
It's nice to meet you. Janine...?
Yeah, she's gonna live with me!
Nobody cares about the Dakotas.
What? You forgot fourteen states?
Hey, Rach, did you make your money?
I'd just like to say that I'm totally behind this experiment. In fact, I'd very much like to butter your head.
I thought you were going out with Elizabeth.
Oh you knew that. Good!
What if they get mixed up?
Ok. Ahh. One of my things is, I always separate my sweat socks from my dress socks.
You wanna fool around with Joey?
In the hall.
I'll meet you there in two minutes.
Y'know, I saw a wine cellar downstairs...
Well there's not much we can do.
Wel-wel-well what are we gonna do?
No, it's more like a good luck.
That's sweet.
Ahh, Phoebe, I'm gonna miss you!
Hey. Guess what! My landlord just called and my apartment is gonna get ready soon, so I guess I'll be moving out.
I know, I just thought it would be fun.
But we don't do that.
Y'know...go! Go! Right there!
There are snow cones! Snow cones! Yuck!
So how's it going with you guys?
No kind. He just makes it up.
Yes! And that would be a shut-down!
I'm having a son. Um...
Come on! It wasn't that bad!
You mean the spitter?
Yes, I did! And you are welcome!
Hi. I understand you had a little talk with Emily.
Oh, I love it! Thank you so much!
Maybe we'll have to listen and see!
Pulling what? It's second down.
It just amazes me that your still pulling stuff like this.
Your a poet and don't know it.
I thought I would, but the translation's no good.
Okay, Phoebe you know what you're doing right?
Okay, so what do you guys really think of Chandler?
It's gonna be a problem, isn't it?
Monica what're you doin'? You can't go shopping with her? What about Rachel?
We are on a roll, people!!
Oh, we have one too!!
That's sweet. Drink your hair.
You know, it's funny. Every time you say "triplets," I immediately think of three hot blonde 19-year olds.
You're mother killed herself!
Well, ok, I wasn't rich like you guys, ok, I didn't eat gold and have a flying pony... I had a hard life, my mother was killed by a drug dealer.
In 1981 you were 13!
Sure! I was there! Spring Break '81! Woo-hoo!
Hi, Dad, what are you doing here?
Oh yeah, I always picture your Mom when I'm having sex.
I'm just trying to spice it up!
Monica?!
Oh that's sweet. Don't touch me.
These-these are beads of joy.
Well, why would she lie to you?
Yeah!
So, is Joey gonna stop snoring?
Hey!
I just thought he was nice, y'know?
All right, c'mere, gimme your feet.
Isn't he an architect now?
Not so good, Simmons and I gave him a wedgie.
Come on! I really need your help!
No-no-no-no-no-no-no, you are not getting me this way.
Why would they think they're invited?
What they're not invited?! Oh no, that's terrible! They're gonna be crushed!
I make the decisions, and I say no.
Why? Why not?! People love to hear that!
So, are you sorry that I told them?
Woah, woah, woah, woah. Which sister?
Yeah, that'd be great! Thank you!
Yes, but I'm doing this.
Maybe he didn't give you a chance.
I'm... I'm just... I'm the worst person ever. How can I not tell David that I'm seeing Mike?
Damn it! Rookie mistake!
That was a test and you just failed.
All right, let's go say good-bye.
Okay.
No, you were right. I don't have a plan.
I'm so sorry, you guys. I didn't mean to bring you down.
No-no-no! We need something old!
Let's go!
Do you know what's a bad idea?
Yeah!
Then all your stuff would be here.
Y'know I was thinking, what if I uh, unpack here?
Did I squeeze it too hard?
Okay. Oh my God! What did I ever do to you?!
Would it really have been that easy?
Yes!!
That's it big girl! Come on!
Or I'll hear you.
007 has a fancy car!
Batman has a utility belt!
I just wanted to see how it's going.
Hey!
I know.. it's gonna be really hard.
Honey.. you should always feel the thing. Listen, if that's how you feel about the guy, Monica, dump him!
No! Rachel is meeting us here.
We are. He's meeting us here.
Rach! It's me! Pick up!
Ohh please don't be from a real dinosaur! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Made in Mexico! Yes!! Ugh, who would buy this?!
Have you found your dress yet?
I'm Megan Bailey.
What do you think brought than on?
Oh yeah! I mean, that was pretty intense.
What are you talking about? What wedding?
I think my boyfriend ever so dreamy, I wonder what our wedding's gonna be like.
Oh, but wait I do have a globe.
Oh.
All right, what about the third guy?
Easy for you to say; you'll be wearing a veil.
Oh, I was hoping you wouldn't remember.
Oh my God, oh- is today the twentieth, October twentieth?
Oh, and the newspaper delivery guy.
Uhh, the mailman, the super.
We are not friends with Phoebe anymore.
Soldier down!
Rachel used to live in that room.
Really? Then what are they doing in our guestroom?
Well, no. You're Chandler. Y'know, Chandler!
Ha-ha-ha. A little to hard. What am I not ah, boyfriend material?
Oh-ho, look what I got Julio.
What are you wrapping?
Well, you could actually go to the gym.
We're doomed. Okay, they're gonna take 50 bucks out of our accounts for the rest of our lives. What are we gonna do?
So what did you do today Pete?
So ask me what I did today.
Oh, you're breaking up with Tony?
Tony?
Yeah. What d'you wanna do tonight?
Oh, yeah?
You know what, everything's gonna be okay.
Yeah, it is.
So you watched the movies huh?
Oh, ok, murder, cancer, soccer teams eating each other in the Andes.
Hey! How'd the audition go?!
Hi.
It's kind of a package deal!
They...do that?
Oh sweetie, I'm so proud of you!
Oh my God, congratulations!
Guys, you got your hair cut.
Yes.
Wait! Oh my God! I can't get out!
Okay, a little problem. The key broke in the lock and I can't get in!
There. Here's their card.
So, do you get colours or just French tips?
Oh good, I think so too. Pheebs?
To yourself. Hey-hey-hey, y'know what that's pretty good.
I have some pretty exciting news!
No, why?
Please tell me it's his mother.
Ooh, wait.. wait, I see a woman.
Maybe I do! I'm pretty feisty!
Look, you don't want to fight me.
Our guy's a great dancer!
Oh, Chandler funny?
I gave you a key for emergencies!
Hi! Hello!
Never call me from that phone.
Yeah.
: Hi, how was your flight?
Hi honey I'm home!
Phoebe! Put that cigarette out!
Oh yeah, the doctor said that could be one of the side effects.
Seriously, what is this supposed to mean?
Hang on a second. I'll-I'll talk to you in the morning. I'm sorry what?
Did they just kill off Joey?
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.
Why is this car in my bedroom?
Phoebe!
Oh my God Chandler! I can't believe it!
Have a seat son. Hey!!
Oh my God, are you out of a job?
Bloomingdale's eliminated my department.
Stop it!! That's not funny!!
Well, I could make it seem like he's here. "Here's some little known facts about cous-cous. They didn't add the second cous until 1979."
She's leaving for three months.
Hmm.
I don't need a tissue! I'm fine-d!
I'm gonna grab you some tissue.
Well, why don't we just bunny up.
Okay, so how do we decide that?
Hey Rach, somebody got you shoes!
Oh ... Happy birth ... oh, see you later.
I don't get older. I just get better!
Why come all the way from Kansas to do that?
You were my first kiss ever?
You were my first kiss with Rachel?
Phoebe, you have to lift it and point.
Monica your remote doesn't work.
Chandler? Can you give me a hand?
Pshhshhh!
Which one was Pete Carney?
Ok, ok, Roger was creepy, but he was nothing compared to Pete Carney.
I was just waiting for the perfect guy.
Nine.
Why do you care so much anyway?
Okay, I'm going to go stand over there.
Ross, I'm gonna use yours, okay?
But the drawer full of take-out menus is okay, right?
That's it. That's my worse Thanksgiving.
Yeah that's the same.
Hey, you touch that and you will be sorry.
Oh yeah!
Actually, I was gonna do them jullienne.
You gonna slice them up real nice?
What happened in Atlantic City?!
Du-ude!
I need to borrow a hundred bucks.
Well, couldn't we just lose our virginities again? Ya know, because I think actually mine's growing back.
What?! You're going out with her again!
Hey, relax I just need more time. We're going to dinner tonight.
So to get this part you can't be?
Barmifsaed?
No, I just I think that it's too soon.
Oh. Look, just friends, I won't grope you. I promise.
God, I feel so guilty about Ross.
I think he's right. You guys hang out at the coffeehouse way too much.
Oh my God! You're water broke!
Uh, Pheebs, you're leaking?
I swear you said you had the keys.
All right, listen, smirky. If it wasn't for you and your stupid balloon, I would be on a plane watching a woman do this right now. But I'm not.
Why? What did you do in the bathroom?
We have to leave!!
Oh my God! You still have the Chipper!
Here, we are.
You still have feelings for me don't you?
What?
That bastard taped over me!
What...? That's not you! Life is good again! Ride 'em cowgirl!
Chicken Soup for the Soul?
Hey!
So you're free Thursday, then.
Yes, and her boyfriend. But we're celebrating Thanksgiving in December 'cause he is lunar.
She has to know that your not ready.
This is a very critical time right now. If you feel yourself reaching for that phone, then you go shoe shopping, you get your butt in a bubble bath. You want her back you have to start acting aloof.
I hope Ross isn't too upset.
Oh no, maybe it's me, I'm just not giving you enough credit. Uh, I mean it is difficult to say goodbye to five people. Uh, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, good... IT'S PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE. You know what? After all we've been through, I can't believe this is how you want to leave things between us. Have a, have a good time in Paris.
Phoebe, you were supposed to take that back!
...so this guy was all And I'm all, Buffay, Homicide. It was just so cool!
We're gonna see each other naked.
It bodes well for me that speed impresses you.
Oh, did you do a picture of Emma?
Well, anyway, they make these great novelty cakes, in all different shapes, and if you give them a photo, they'll copy it in icing!
Hey! How did it go with Elizabeth?
Hey!
This doesn't mean anything, does it?
Well, I told you not to walk. Here. There. Okay.
I'm sure they'll be here soon.
Where are they?
You don't want to know what tonight was.
What was tonight?
No-no! Don't do it! Don't!
All right, let me in.
Here you go. You can wear this.
Oh! Worm medicine for the duck.
I just, I can't believe that we made it!
Wait a minute! I have a date tomorrow night.
Oh God, I am so sorry honey...
"Listen, oh... it turns I got the last spot. I'm really sorry man, it was a lot of fun working with you. Give me a call if you want."
C'mon guys, it'll be fun!
Yeah... I think we do... ... about what?
Ok, well, what kind of ritual?
Yeah. So, we can do it tomorrow night, you guys. It's Valentine's Day. It's perfect.
I know! Hey, how's Chandler doin'?
Oh my God! Monica!
OK, try this salmon mousse.
Alright...
Okay, well, stop staring at them.
No, no, I knew .
What? Something happened with the plates?
Oh, you told her you broke all the plates, huh?
I'm sorry, but that's my happy place.
All right. No, no, no, not a Richard thing, just put down the glass. And get out!
Well, how bout just her mom?
Ok, so I guess we don't invite her parents.
Okay, good! Okay, what do I want now?
Noo!
What does she mean by 'involved'?
She is so great! I miss her.
Why don't you go see Dr. Gettleman?
We've got to find a new pediatrician. Ross was getting sick last night, and I think Emma may have caught it.
Chicken? I could eat some chicken.
Are you okay? I'm so sorry, he wouldn't leave. He kept asking me about chicken.
Yeah, but that's pigs not people!
Sure I do. In fact, I think the whole concept of marriage is unnatural. I mean look at pigs. Let's take a second here and look at pigs. Okay pigs don't mate for life. I mean a pig can have like a hundred sexual partners in a lifetime, and that's just an ordinary pig not even a pig that's good at sports!
You're gonna do some feet flirtin'!
Because that's the only part of you he can see when he's on the table!
I sure do! And you don't get one!
Very good Monica! You know where they are.
Well, are you just hanging out with Ross?
No! No-no-no-no-no-no. It sounds like they really need you down there.
Haven't you and I covered that topic?
Yeah, a slice of cheesecake and-and a date if you're given' 'em out.
Oh my God, I wrecked your baby!!
Oh, and also, he's, he's walkin' kind of funny, his left leg is moving a lot faster than his right leg, and he's in there just sort of y'know...
WE'RE GETTING A BABY!
And?
I was probably waiting for it to open.
Last time I saw you, it was the morning I left for college. And you were just standing outside The Dairy Queen.
Does he not make enough money?
No!
Aww, thank you. Uh Rach?
And a nice hot cider for Monica.
And you know what? We want a rematch.
OK, Monica? I had another answer all ready.
What?! I-I-I don't, I don't do that!
What?!
I'm sorry that I borrowed your gloves
Well, I'm sorry I went out with him when I knew you liked him.
I hate men! I hate men!
I assume we're looking for an answer more sophisticated than 'to get you into bed'.
Y'know, the possible side affects.
Say what?
We don't, we don't wrestle now.
Yeah, they were very y'know...wrestley. But, I guess that's normal?
Y'know what? I'll think you'll play.
Okay, first of all, I don't play with cheaters, and second of all, you know I had swollen glands!!
I wish all guys could be like him.
Oh! And, he's the kinda guy who, when you're talking, he's listening, y'know, and not saying 'Yeah, I understand' but really wondering what you look like naked.
You got it from Pottery Barn?!
Monica look! Look-look-look! Here is that table that I ordered.
That you're not funny or sexy?
I knew all I had to do was let the material speak for itself. Everyone's all, "Ross you have to be funny and sexy." Well, I proved them wrong! And now, I'm gonna pass the news onto Joey and Chandler.
I was trying to help out a squirrel.
Then how did you get caught in the barbed wire?
Ready for your birthday lunch?
Hi!
Hey, Joey's ass! What are you doing?
Oh yes, somebody just said, "Can you hear anything?"
You can't be a lawyer. You're eight.
Good, good, I'm a lawyer now.
Seriously, where did you get the hat?
What a minute, I know that hat! I was taken aboard that hat! They did experiments on me! I can't have children!!
So, Chandler, who's on your list?
Ah, the heart of every healthy relationship. Honesty, respect, and sex with celebrities.
I think you're better than you think you are.
Y'know, I don't know if you've ever looked up the term goofing around in the dictionary... Well, I have, and the technical definition is, two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just wanna spend more time together. But if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me, then we have to, y'know, get you my original dictionary. I am so bad at this.
5 6 7 8!
Okay, let's do it. Mom and Dad are gonna be so faced!
OK, what're we gonna do about this?
Now I'm mommy in this little play? Alright look, I refuse to get sucked into this like, weird little Geller dimension thing OK. So I'm gonna go and take a nice long hot bubble bath because you kids are driving me crazy.
Ohhh, Chandler, sorry! Hey, Janice.
Oh, Chandler, sorry.
I wanna say good-bye at the car!
Bye-bye!
Oh dad, really you don't need to...
Oh, I don't think I ever heard that story.
Well, the club lost it's power.
Haha! Looks like you're not going to be in the wedding either. So sorry Pheebs.
Phyllis sees what I'm doing.
I see what you're doing!
You've got to be smooth about it.
Right, calm down, O'Mally. I'll slip him some money.
Ohh. And I don't even have a date.
Well then we'll get wet.
So, Phoebe runs weird huh?
Aw, Mon...
Come here, I want to show you something!
Scared me out of ever wanting to live with him.
I am good. I finished my book.
So, how are you?
You are not a freak. You're a guy.
Chandler, you have just described virtually every man that we have ever gone out with.
Heads! No, Tails! He-he-heads!
Monica, you call it.
Oh. I'm sorry it didn't work out.
...Hm.
Joey!! What the hell were you doing?!
Clear the tracks for the boobie payback express. Next stop: Rachel Green.
You were just being so nice to him!
Why did you invite him?? I can't stand that guy!
I won't know what I would do without you.
Yeah, you are. And I'm so glad that you fought your way back in, because I don't know what I would do without you.
Chandler? Do you promise to be good?
Yeah! We promise! We'll be good!
Helloooo? Yeah. Oh my God. Thanks.
Hello? Yes, she is, hold on a second, please. Monana, it's for you, the credit card people.
I had to go with the odds Rach.
Hey! Those are all the things I'm responsible for!
Uh, you left out the stupid part.
..so, he said it was just a sprain, and that was it.
Really? Let's get past the moment.
Uh, ah, Monica's pregnant?!
Chasing him all around the room?
Oh, come on!
Okay, now we just need something borrowed!
I don't think so.
Joey we know you steal our food.
Whoa, I didn't know we could date your sister!
Oh my God!!! What are you doing?!!
Okay, here's your penis!
We're kidding. C'mon, tell us!
Fine. Fine, alright, now you'll never know.
DON'T...be too long with the phone.
Ok. Listen, just don't say anything about me, ok.
Well, it's like that. With feelings.
Oh, yeah.
Do you not remember the puppet guy?
What?
So? What do you think of the house?
Well, at least the perfume is not mine, be thankful for that!
Umm, she Rach, not it, she.
Oh oh no just stopped to throw up a little bit. Oh come on, what am I gonna do, its been hours and it won't stop crying.
I know, but you have to open it today!
Oh, but it's not 'til tomorrow!
Ahh! Aren't you dressed yet?
Oh come on guys, it's not like I moved to Europe! I just moved across the hall! And we would have you over all the time if it weren't for Monica's allergies. You're right, I could never lie to you. She hates you. Should I get that? Hello? Uh no, Joey's not here right now. Can I take a message? Yeah, okay so the audition has been moved from 5:00 to 2:30? Okay great. Bye.
But, I put some honey in it.
What the hell is this, herbal tea? I hate herbal tea!
What kinda things have you been saying?
And I gotta pay rent! Look, how-how about this? You don't fire me, instead I stay here, I gain their trust, and they'll start listening to all the nice things I've been saying about you.
And some of us really have to pee.
We're worried about you.
Hey, Joey, could you pass the cheese?
Oh, between you telling him that I wanted to have a fling and me putting out on the first date-oh, he's so gonna get the wrong idea.
No he went out to get pizza.
Is Ross here?
Okay, you're-you're really freaking me out.
Okay. All right. Honey listen. When I tell you what I'm about to tell you, I need you to remember that we are all here for you and that we love you.
Shrill?! The wedding is back on!
Well get rid of her, obsessive and shrill.
Ooooh! And-and-and what-what's this?
Salad.
Wow Joey, this is, uhh...
No.
It's in the kitchen, I'll go get it.
And where is your hat?
Alright, well I'm tearing the lettuce.
Now, I want you to tell me what you're doing while you're doing it.
No, we're not! We're not leaving!
We are switching back, right now!
Stop it, stop it, stop it!
You call that delicious?
That would be the work of a Blowfish.
Who gave you that hickey?
He didn't ask me to marry him.
No-no-no oh, keep your name, don't take his name.
Is your tongue swelling up?
Ugh. It's definitely getting worse.
Wait! Wait! This isn't take-out!
Oh, whatever.
All right, I definitely taste nutmeg.
I want to make a ship to shore call to Chandler.
Alright, well tell me one of yours.
Yeah.
You got a callback too didn't you?
Yeah, I had to teach Ross my bit because I actually didn't get a callback.
Please tell me you're stopping now.
It's okay, it's not as bad as it looks, it's a precaution. Ah, I'm not supposed to move my spine.
Is he not cute enough for you?
I don't know... sometimes it doesn't.
Y'know what?! I gotta go! Ugh!
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What is all this pressure?! Is this some new kind of strategy? Why don't you put down your copy of 'The Rules' huh mantrap?!
OK, I'll see you later babe.
OK, now before I go, does anybody else need to be picked up? I'm still gonna go.
That's all the turkey you're gonna get.
I had a dream once about a fax machine that did that.
Oh, just until the glue dries.
And-and-and-and-and the toothpicks?
You're a pig. And you can't do this.
Monica...would you please tell Joey that he is a pig?
What?! You can't-what did you tell her?
Why?
No-no. Nothing wrong about that.
Oh god, don't tell me, I did it wrong.
So you talked to your dad, huh.
Actually it's, it's quite, y'know, typical behaviour when you have this kind of dysfunctional group dynamic. Y'know, this kind of co-dependant, emotionally stunted, sitting in your stupid coffee house with your stupid big cups which, I'm sorry, might as well have nipples on them, and you're like all 'Oh, define me! Define me! Love me, I need love!'.
How would I know? I-I wasn't here.
No. No! No! ...So, um, do you think he's doing any better than he was this morning?
Okay! My turn! My turn!
Thank you!
There you go, enjoy your coffee.
Ok, you can have it.
Oh my God. She's gonna pick us!
But just think, ok? What if everything goes right? What if this woman does pick you guys?
Yeah well, I ran into Richard.
Somebody got in late last night.
I know. Where do you wanna go eat?
I cannot believe her.
Well, I just caught the live show.
Yeah.
I'll help you fix your sweater.
Yes that's right. But still, I-, look at your purse, look at your sweater, look at yourselves.
I guess you have forgotten all about Joey?
Yeah!
Alright, what was this sentence originally?
Yep!
Hey, how long are you in the city?
Hey! Hey, Mr. Trib!
This is a boy, and that's a girl.
Oh, they're so cute! Now, what, what kinds are they?
Ethan, it's um... it's icky.
Then, what's the problem?
Phyllis is sitting in a chair.
Hmm.
That really was some of your best work.
Oww!! My ankle! I really hurt my ankle! I think I twisted it when I-Ooh, a quarter!
So the going for help went well?
Oh good, oh Joey and Chandler are back.
That's not true, you don't have a moustache.
Wow. Y'know we're back where we were. Honey, I would love to do all that, but nothing's changed.
You broke a little girl's leg?!!
All right here. Watch me execute the three 'P's of championship play. Power. Precision. and penache.
Hey! My first review is out!
With them, under them, what's the difference? Eh, Rach?
There it is. Joey, what are you doing?
I love that movie.
No, you said the baby creeps you out.
Hey honey, you got the kind with the little girl, you said we were gonna to get the kind with the baby.
Do you always have to bring him here?
Okay, look, he's not gonna hurt them, right?
Yeah. Which one do you like more?
So Pheebs, pick one of them.
Y'know all my friends think this is weird.
You-you have a very beautiful... eye.
Yes it has! I made cookies!
Well, not much has changed in the last five minutes.
Alright. My job here is done.
Yeah, okay.
Oh! Do you need me to go with you?
Ooh, I gotta go. I found a guy that who could fix up the van for catering.
So? Do you think we should get it?
This is bringing out a lovely color in you!
Ugh! Well, y'know, we were away...
Seven times!
Yes! You are so smart! I love you.
Cat.
Honey, we have been through this before!
Listen, do you guys think I have a chance with Janine?
Oh God, you fell off the wagon.
This is really hard for me to say.
It's just, I'm not good at singing.
But everybody sings. It's so much fun! Last time this adorable old man got out there, forgot all of the words, flipped outand everyone booed him off the stage. So funny.
Ooh, Ugly Naked Dancing!
I've gotta see this. All right Ugly Naked Guy!
Strip Happy Days Game?
OH YES!!!!!
Wouldn't you love to do it just once?!
Oh!
Nah... not-not special enough.
What about Glen? He could be a Glen.
Oh my God, Mike was gonna propose?
Well, that's what I said, but it turns out, Mike was planning on proposing to me that same way last night!
I can't believe Emma is still asleep!
Which one are you?
OK, here you go. Good luck.
OK, then get me your purse.
Why can't you use the phone in here?
Well, I'm not sure. I mean, I guess until she y'know, gets used to the fact that there's y'know, a new mom. Y'know, I think she's worried that y'know, she's gonna, she's gonna be replaced. Well, that's not gonna happen is it? Noo. Okay, I have to return a call in the other room.
Whatever you decide, whatever you do.
Look, we were way out of line, we totally support you.
Uh, would you stop it with that already?!
Are you sure?! Because our guy smells incredible!
No! Chandler and I are moving in together!
You're pregnant!
Ohh, you're about to get a little luckier.
You look amazing. I'm the luckiest man in the world.
I guess. Why? Who's she with?
She's still at dinner?
Hey, the man's dog just died.
Excuse me, but umm, isn't he paying for your dinner?
It doesn't go with any of my stuff.
What? Come on, it's not like I'm asking for this girly clock or anything, which, by the way, I also think is very cool.
Oh good, I hate it when you do that.
And no kissing your neck.
God, look what I found in the drain.
I'm not breaking up with her!
Thank God! I can't watch him anymore!
I cannot believe Ross is buying this!
Hi. Do you know what time it is?
Hi!
Hey everybody! It's Fun Bobby!
Kill me. Kill me now.
Joey... we always know what you mean.
Yeah, well, I still got a week left to go in the program, and according to the rules, if I want to get the money I'm not allowed to conduct any... ersonal experiments, if you know what I mean.
You can spill. In the sink.
Okay, this is what I'm talking about, this. I-I need to live in a land where people can spill.
What? You are way off, lady!
Sure. It's just as well... I mean, last year wasn't very good. I think she's losing her touch.
You gotta help me out here Pheebs.
Because you're marrying him!
Please.. please, we are so close.
oh, honey..
Five more and I'll flash you.
No.
This is kind of a classy place.
But what?
Ah, so glad you decided to come.
Take as long as you want. Just let me know when you're through.
Joey, where are the Jell-o shots?
Well, you're just gonna have to try.
Wait, now, what am I doing again?
Oh, that's fine! Go with your instincts, go with your instincts.
Son of a gun, it is!
Oh my God, that's just like my name!
You had no right to go out with him.
I KNEW IT!!!!
Weren't you asked to leave sonny?
Why? What you'd do?
Nah, he doesn't do anything for me.
I think you should definitely go out with this guy.
Hey Phoebe, will you give me a hand?
A no sex pact huh? I actually have one of those going on with every woman in America.
Did you know I was allergic to shellfish?
Monica, let it go.
Come in. I've been waiting for you.
Works on you.
You're jealous of Princess Caroline?
...I am jealous of her?! I mean who does she think she is?! Princess Caroline?!
Wait! Joey! Joey! Are you okay?!
Wow! Well, uh... Hey! I'm really happy for you guys! Congratulations! See you later.
Oh my God! Oh my God! You have to go!
Okay, I'm going to need a comforter, but did you have a hypoallergenic one because otherwise I get very nasal. Do you have a cat? 'Cause it's already happening. Do you hear that?
You look fabulous honey, you really do.
Oh, this lipstick looks just great on you.
I know!!! My erection is back!
Hey! This is where your hyper-organized-pain-in-the-ass stuff pays off!
So it's okay to date a student.
We had such a great time! She's-she's incredible! I thought the-the age difference might be a problem, but it wasn't. It wasn't at all. Elizabeth is very mature for her age. A concept lost on some people!
Can you go any faster with that?
Nope, not that one.
Ok. Hey, why don't you ask Richard?
Yeah, Ross can't go so it's between my friend Eric Prower who has breath issues and Dan with the poking. 'Did you see that play? Do you want some more beer? Is that Spike Lee?'
Okay. Oh! A coloring book!
Well, these. These are yours right here.
I don't want things to change! Do you?
Me too!
Fine, I'll rub it on myself.
No-no-no-no-no!
You're the best friend I ever had.
I wouldn't know what I'm gonna do without you...
I'm checking out the restaurant with Pete.
What?
Gunther, can I get a coffee to go?
Uh-oh, shht! The Misses.
I don't think mine likes me either.
That's weird. I don't think my boss likes me either.
God! If you're gonna cry about it!
Okay, I'm sorry.
Oh, yay. Ok about that two.
Oh honey, I'm fine.
Why, do you write him a lot?
I couldn't tell him no. He got so sad. Maybe it'll be all right. I do really like him a lot and probably do it eventually anyway and plus, think of all the money I'll save on stamps.
What, that little thing at the prom?
Nooo! It's not okay! I can't believe you would want to after what he did to me!
Oh, Candy! She was so spunky!
Yeah, I really liked that fighter pilot one.
And Mindy, your maid of...?
Barry who I almost.
You didn't even take off your pants.
I saw you checking me out during the game last night.
I don't know who I'm happiest for...
Guess what? I finally got that seed out of my teeth.
Oh God! What did I just step on?
Alright.
Just waiting for it to stop bubbling.
Aren't you going to swallow that?
No, I called him. It's not gonna happen.
And there's not chance that will work?
The Luisa from home room!
Luisa? Oh my God! Monica! It's Luisa!
Well, you used to like playing the guitar.
I know! But if I didn't work there, what else would I do?
Sure, what? Ok, ok. Music?
Look, can, can you do something for me?
'Slim Pickings'...That is so cheesy.
No, 'Slim Pickings', it's a barbecue restaurant. They're looking for a cook. Actually 'cook' may be a bit of a stretch. They're looking for someone to shovel mesquite.
Oh yeah, picked a guy, 37135.
So you're really doing this, huh?
What-what was it you were gonna tell us?
Yeah, come here!
Ok everybody, it's time for flan.
Thank you.
Where you can make out with your assistant.
Well, why shouldn't I be? I have great friends! I have a wonderful job!
Honey, you're not pathetic, you're sad.
Oh God, I know I'm a pathetic loser.
Promise to call me when you land.
Oh man.
Rachel! That was a library card!
Y'know what? I think we can just leave it at that. It's kinda like a symbolic gesture...
Did you like learn about her family?
You-you think?
Oh. Big family dinner tonight?
I moved back here a couple of months ago.
Seriously, you don't think we should tell him?
Well, we cannot tell Joey about this. He's already flipping out about everything that's changing. This will push him over the edge.
"Willing to adopt triplets?" No!
Oh, that's Frank Jr. Jr. pulling the tampons out of the lady's purse. And that's Chandler climbing on Chandler, and that's Leslie throwing bagels at him.
I know, but look at me all tan.
Yeah, I'm not in that.
You kissed a guy?!! Oh my God.
And this girl is making eyes at Chandler, okay? So after awhile he-he goes over to her and uh, after a minute or two, I see them kissing. Now, I know what you're thinking, Chandler's not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out with girls, and you're right, Chandler's not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out with...girls.
Right there! That was so fake!
Hey, Mr Philips, nice suit!
Hi. I'll be ready in just a second.
Oh God, even his knock is boring.
Oh, right! I completely forgot about that.
So ah, there was this thing I wanted to talk to you about.
What are you doing here? You can't be here!
Are we in London?
Careful. Careful. CAREFUL! Sorry.
No, I'm not talking about you. It was your fat friends brother with that bad afro, do you remember? Ross starts talking over her 'do you remember' line: Amy. I'm going to save you some time, ok. All me. Monica and Chandler's Apartment.
Yeah, she's here. Hold on a second.
Let's just say there's a well-dressed pack of dogs in Ohio. Hey Monica listen is-is Phoebe there? I gotta ask her something about the car.
I don't know, Chandler. Let's take a look.
Gee, Monica, what's in the bag?
Do you want our guy to be your guy?
Our guy smells incredible.
We'll discuss it, in the morning!
Open up! Open up! Open up!
Okay, just get a lot better. Fast.
Look, I'm gonna get better. Okay? I promise you.
Phoebe, I thought you said you know what you're doing?
What's block?
What are peanut butter fingers?!
Oh yeah, I added three.
They just gonna love you, just be yourself.
Really? That hadn't occurred to me.
Kinda like your Barca lounger.
No-no-no-no, if we let her stay, she will stay forever!
Demi Moore is not a he.
Demi Moore.
Oh stop it. Joey already told me.
What surprise party?
Thank you. Just make yourself comfortable.
Like you wouldn't believe. Wow! This is a great place.
Really? I'd say 3 to 4.
Oh, I'd say about a month.
Rach, why won't they take it back?
Maybe that's because she's a minion of the anti-Christ.
Joey, Chandler knows I borrowed the money.
Because she is!
You went out with Wallis Pincer?
Yeah, totally! You are in such good hands. And I'm so good with meeting parents. With the father, you know, you want to flirt a little bit, but not in a gross way. Just kind of like: "Oh mr. Pincer, I can see where Wallis gets his good looks..."
Wow. That is not a happy hi.
.....Hi.
That's ok. I'm sorry I poisoned you.
I just wanna thank you for being there for me today. And I'm sorry I,I almost broke your hand.
No, I don't think it ever works. Why?
Do you think it's possible for two friends to fool around and... and not have it be a big deal?
It's the heat. And-and the humidity.
Whew! Stood up to fast, got a little head rush.
What about when I started dating Chandler?
We started saving again when you were dating Richard and then that went to hell, so we redid the kitchen.
Oh, then it must've been you. Bye.
You didn't leave lipstick marks on the phone.
No, don't say it! Don't even think it!
Huh, that's funny. You look like you're gonna be the...
Don't you want to look through the rest?
Wait. Advertising! That's a great idea!
Well, actually, I'm already seeing someone.
That - that's an idea.
Are you gonna dress up as Santa?
Ohh! That's great!
I can't believe Phoebe's gonna have her babies!
Wait, wait, remember when my water broke?
Why? Do you have a report due?
Hey. I need an atlas! I need an atlas!
Chandler, wh-why don't we sit down?
Richard! No one supposed to know about us! See I, did it again.
Umm, you've got some on your pants.
What?
Anyway, how did it go with Kate?
I'm so, so, so sorry, Joey. I definitely am gonna see you're play. I swear you're play is very important to us, thank you for your patience. You're play is the next play is the next play I'm gonna see.
Do you wanna come in for some lemonade?
That's a uh, that's a tough combination.
Oh my God! You don't know me at all!
It's okay, you don't have to be the best at everything.
Rachel, things can get incredibly complicated.
I don't know, what were the names I just said?
But no. Maybe if I were baking.
Impressive.
Have you guys picked a date yet?
Oh, the Olympics.
Have you even had a girl up here?
You're bachelor pad?!
I'll put a pillowcase over my head.
You know, I'd love to, but I'm a little tired.
Yeah, I know. He can get really competitive.
Can you believe what a jerk Ross was being?
Heyyy!! You got the door open!!
Okay, everybody stay here. I will find out what's going on.
We were just waxing our legs.
We're all right.
A kiss? What are you talking about?
Yeah! No?
Honey why don't you go lie down.
Yea yea.
Is there? Is there someone else?
Wha...
We, we just wanna see the end.
I'm sorry I'm late, what happened?
All you had to do was buy the card!
No I know, because to be a grandmother you have to be married and have children and I don't have any of those things. That's why it's so funny.
About that? Erm...I'm going to change.
Yeah?
Ehm, we were friends in 1992.
Well, it was 1992, and I remember because that was the year I had sex with Evil Knievel .
Okay well I think...that's your answer.
No! No! I...didn't do that. It's just... Okay, honestly no. I don't, I don't see a big future with her.
Come on, we can't let them win!
No. And if I did, I don't think we'd be going out. Monica, this is getting ridiculous!
Wow! A lipper from Chipper.
No, I think it's cute.
Rachel!! Come on! Let me in!
Well...
Great, now he's waving back.
Oh my God! Go away! Stop looking in here!
We do not have one of those signs.
You guys have one of those signs that says 'We don't swim in your toilet, so don't pee in our pool.', you know.
So, I'll get-get back to my friend.
Yeah.
Not everybody's happy. Hey Bobby!
Everybody looks so happy. I hate that.
So ah, Phoebe, how was your date?
Congratu!! -lations-lations.
Hey, look at you! Where have you been?
Hi!
Y'know what, I'm gonna hold her head.
1...2...
Well, Ross was mugged as a kid.
Why?
Rach, are you really gonna let him do this?
Okay.
Hey Joey, I don't think we can use this.
Yeah, yeah and hey, I really mean it, dude.
GET OUT YOU DUFUS!!
Well, you're not sixteen, you're both adults now.
Yeah! So-so when are you getting married?
Oh, thanks for the tip.
Oh my God! Have you lost your mind?
But, we can't go now. It looks like Rachel's gonna put on a skit.
A love scene? With who?
I don't know! I mean, maybe that's something to do with the fact that I saw him do a love scene yesterday.
I mean, that's a typical guy response.
Really.
I guess they're back from their date.
Oh. Oh my God, is that Phoebe?
Do you wanna do it at the same time?
Yep!
I thought you said you were going to do nothing.
Oh nope, I-I have plans with Joey.
I'm sorry, I think that you just misunderstood her.
Oh, y'know I-I can't hear that enough.
Me going out with Richard's son.
What's twisted?
It's.. It's just so pretty and white.
You want me to wash my hands first, don't you?
It's just a little bit more, honey.
Uh-huh. I know. It was just, it was just the perfect way to say goodbye.
It's enough for wedding scenario eight.
Well what?! How-how much is it?!
Uh-huh, what exactly did you ask her?
Of course I did.
We're-we're really sorry we fogged you.
Hi! You might not remember us, but we are the girls that fogged you.
That's different! I was drunk and stupid!
Please, what about you and Chandler?
Shoot, I think I got mayonaise on you.
What?
Why won't I be married when I'm 40?
All right. I'll tell you what. When we're 40, if neither one of us are married, what do you say you and I get together and have one?
Okay, okay... Chandler you... you stop it!
If I'd known you guys were coming over, I would have brought more pizza.
I'm just so glad you got to see the babies.
Oh, you guys, I can't believe this. But I'll leave now, or I'm gonna miss my plane.
You still want to move in together right?
Fine! It's your life! I just don't want to see you guys break up! Which you will do if you move in together, but that's what you want, there's nothing I can do. DON'T DO IT!!!!!
Okay. Can you give me a little push?
All right.
I can't believe he's that upset about this...
...No...
What?!! You cannot tell him that!!
Well, ultimately, I was trying y'know, I-I wanted...tell him y'know, that I'm still in love with him.
Who? Two divorces and Joey?!
Yeah I know, but I was really confused and then I talked to these guys.
Okay, come on, do it one more time!
Yes!
You know, I would give her up, for you.
Well, I mean, sure, of course. But... you already gave that to Monica, so...
Hang on a second I just got in.
That's, that's funny. Change!
Like only if the queen comes?
Nope... Hey... so I'm gonna... put the plates back. You know, I think you were right, I don't think we should use these plates again for a looong time.
Because Chandler still has feelings for you!
Why?
Hello, people who do not live here.
All right then. Bye.
Well, we appreciate anything you can tell us.
I mean, you have a lovely home.
Well we... we kinda broke up.
What happened?
Shut up!! It just got interesting!
Roll-roll!!
Hello? Hold on. It's your boss.
Just double checking ...no, no, no... No!
God works in mysterious ways.
It's wrong. They made a mistake. They think we're somebody else.
Okay, so Ross will be doing the reading.
It'll be a short one.
Did he just say 'Monica bang'?
Okay, I heard that.
So this is it, we're really gonna adopt?
Me too. I wanna find a baby that needs a home and I wanna raise it with you. And I wanna mess it up in our own specific way.
Okay. So, which boxes are mine?
Yeah! Yeah! Oh, this will make a great memory.
Hey, check me out, I'm a slut!
Let me tell you about this chick I scored with last night! Oh no wait a minute that was you!
Sorry. So how's it going with Joey?
Yeah! Or too, you could be two stockbrokers and you're-you're-you're rolling around naked on the trading floor and everybody's watching! It never happened.
Okay everybody, let's go! Let's go!
Oh, 19! We thought you said 90!
And they weren't looking at you before?!
All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring. Now I don't know what to do, everybody starts looking at me.
Oh, I love my life, I love my life!
Ah, the lesser-known "I don't have a dream" speech.
So, wait, you really did like my cookies?
No, the place is not open 'till Tuesday. Am I not saying it right.
Plus, everyone's gonna see your thing.
Well that's true. And I am only naked in one scene. Plus it sounds really great. My character's catholic and he falls in love with this Jewish girl. Who run away together and they get caught in this big rainstorm. So we go into this barn and undress each other and hold each other. It's really sweet and-and tender.
Wendy bailed. I have no waitress.
Who was that?
Okay, knock yourself out, Larry.
I'll check the kitchen floors.
No, you messed it up. You're stupid.
Well, you-you know what I meant.
Ross they're really, really, really white.
Come on, seriously.
Rach, does this have nonfat milk?
Well, we just happen to go to alot of places where you might drink. I mean, how do you go to a wine tasting without having a drink? Or... or to a club, or to the... zoo.
Eh, we weren't that close anyway!
Well I think it's safe to say that our friendship is effectively ruined.
He said he's really gonna miss you guys.
Did he mention us?
Yeah! And I got it on sale, too.
No, I mean it, this feels really good. Is it a hundred percent cotton?
Rachel, he like, totally changed time.
No, was he any good in it?
How bad you wanna smoke, right now.
I know.
I'm sorry, I don't understand what you just said.
Okay, easy Martina. I think we should let them win the next game.
Welcome to our side of the tunnel.
Oh God.
Wow, you're really crazy about her, huh?
Yeah! Oh my God! Is this what it's like to be you?
Okay, I just don't get why you like it so much.
This is what I want to do.
How do you know she's gonna start talking?
Yeah so get ready to hear alot of ehm...boohaki, goshdarnit and brotherpucker.
And lucky means, more cleavage?
Yeah, I did. I needed my lucky dress.
And yet, we're still poking him.
He's alive! He's a-live!!!
Have you ever taken out the trash?
Oh yeah, I know, but the garbage was full.
Rach, Phoebe hates Pottery Barn.
A pharmacist.
Wait, now so you joined the gym?
No, I almost did, couldn't leave Ross there without a spotter!
If I tell you, you'll think I'm crazy.
Then, you're redoing it because...
Who do you wanna fool around with?
Yeah.
Is it okay for me to come in now?
Gone! I mean its amazing Pheebs. I feel so free and so graceful. Hey! Look out for the horse! Sorry!
Uh, good hands. Healing hands.
Plus I thought the baby would be in good hands with a doctor!
All right everybody, this turkey is ready!

Thanks. So, I guess I better be going.
Drops. Here, they're free.
I know. How could we have let this happen?
Oh wow, I hope you don't take this the wrong way but, I know we had plans to meet up tonight and, ugh, I'm just kinda worried about what it might do to our friendship.
There are no tickets on the nightstand!
What about the ones you have on the nightstand?
Rach, you're gonna come though aren't you?
Yeah.
Yeah, there's one right under the cabinet.
Do you guys have like a big bowl I can borrow?
Because we won our apartment back!
Why are you screaming and hugging?
Oh, thank you. Would you like a tour?
It's a lovely apartment.
But I thought if you left, you get fired.
I never want to leave you again!
Janice, what umm, what are you doing here?
Did she see us yet? Did she see us?
And yet, here we are doing it again.
Monica, your Sweet Sixteen was like a million years ago.
Yeah, let-let-let's pretend that's not true.
That's so funny to think if you'd just done that right after the last contest, no one would have had to move at all.
: I'm gonna go freshen up ok.
everything's great, just watching some regular television there, what a pleasant surprise.
You can let some of them go by!
I just hope...
So you're moving in with him. What happened?
All right.
Breathe, breathe, breathe... Good.
I know!
I'm sorry that I made you stop seeing him.
I'll help you throw out your purse.
Are you saying that you don't wanna get with this?
That would be impossible to resist if you weren't all drippy here.
What makes you think that I might not be okay?
Well, I just wanted to make sure you were okay.
Oh, gosh, you got some on your shirt.
Op.
Nothing, I just heard something nice about you.
What?
"Wendy" is a fat girl name.
Wow, it really is!
Yeah, we had a great time, thank you!
Oh, we're just... we're sad to go so we're just saying goodbye to the hotel. I love you... Paradise Hotel, Golf resort and Spa...
Please, just a little bit off the back.
You know, I think I was sixteen.
Yes but my mom got me this job.
God, oh God Monica, I forgot. This is our first date.
No forget it, I'm not gonna tell you now.
Because it's in a slightly different time zone than the kitchen.
What did you do to his sweater vests?
Not as upset as he's gonna be when he finds out what I did with his sweater vests!
Aw, sometimes. Always, actually.
Good that's a good one. Okay, Monica, anything? Y'know? Does Rachel move the phone pen?
Ross, I hated you when we were kids.
Yeah, c'mon I mean I though, you know, I thought we're just foolin' around. Like when, uh, when we were kids.
Okay, okay... Okay, I feel a little better.
You can do this. Just breathe.
Boy, you are really not a morning person.
What the hell is that?!! What the hell is that? Is that you? Ohhhhhhh!
Oh, how do you play the shadow game?
Oh, how do you play the shadow game?
Oh, that's what I would do, forget mine.
Orrr, you could follow him and see where he goes.
No-no-no, wait! We need something old!
Let's go!
Oh my God! Rachel!! You look terrific!
Mon, look who I ran into!
Ross, she's 25 years old.
Wow, I haven't seen her for like forever. I wonder if she still carries that Barbie everywhere she goes.
Oh God, you are about to get sooo lucky.
Honey, you are in it.
Can you just hold on for one minute?
Yeah!
I thought I was something that we both wanted!
God why why would you want to do that to yourself!?
So Chandler, I guess I'll see you at dinner.
Oh mom! Okay, umm, her name is Carol. And she's really pretty. And smart. And uh, she's-she's on the lacrosse team and the golf team. Can you believe it? She plays for both teams!
That's a little more than I wanted to see.
Relax. Here hold this . This old stuff just comes right off.
Come in! Come in! We're engaged!!!
Can we come it yet?! We're dying out here!
Okay. Chandler? Can I see you for a second?
Yeah!
And the way she slaps all the time!
She is so good at throwing drinks in people's faces, I mean I don't think I've ever seen her finish a beverage.
Umm, do you have any uhh, moves?
Okay!
Y'know you're really not supposed to be back here!
I still love you. And I know I probably shouldn't even be here telling you this, I mean you're with Chandler a guy I really like, and if you say he's straight I'll believe you! After seeing ya the other night I knew if I didn't tell ya I'd regret it for the rest of my life. Letting you go was the stupidest thing I ever did.
Say good-bye to sore muscles!
It's so good I don't know what I've done to deserve it!
I guess Joey was right, it does nothing.
Thank God.
What the hell is that dog doing here?!
Sure!
So, I guess you're next. You're ready?
I'm sor... Just go. Just go. I can't, I can't.
Looks like he's playin' baseball.
Yeah.
She sent the chicken back again?!
You didn't bring me here to do that, did you?
You're right. I'm sorry. I should've told you.
When you go lunching with hunky moustache men and don't tell me about it!
Are you freaking kidding me, Green?
No really, she didn't sleep well last night, so we can't wake her up.
We'll just...we'll just let her stay.
Okay!
You've never met Bob, have you?
Which what?
They really were pretty, weren't they?
Look, forget it. We tried, but Phase Three is a lost cause, Okay? Those strippers were insanely hot, and I couldn't picture myself with any of them.
You seriously changed your name to that?
Uh! Princess Consuela.
Good. What made you change your mind?
All right. I thought about it and maybe you're right. Maybe Krog is not a safe toy.
We were shopping, and we had lunch.
What?
That is so funny. Let me see that.
Goo, goo, goo, waaah!
Did you eat all the neighbor candy?!
Yeah?
Oh good, I'm glad that's catching on.
Well, who cares what your Mom thinks? So you pulled a Monica.
Hey, come on, Phoebe, you understand don't you?
Because it's Richard's son! It's like inviting Greek tragedy over for dinner!
And so, we're hiding in the bathroom.
Not great.
Richard buzzed. He's waiting downstairs.
Get away from me I said no!
You got out of the whole Tulsa thing?
I've got good news!
Home is Home Star stew.
Ah, yeah, umm. Home is never far away..
We weren't picking up, it's Amanda!
Hang on, she's right here. Someone's on the phone, for ya.
That, you get? That, you get?
Yes!
Oh my God yes! Who is she?
Well, let's see... Okay uh, is that her?
Are you funny? Tell us a joke!
What are you guys doing?
I'm so sorry. Please, stop freaking out.
Ross, let me show you where the guest room is.
That cold makes you sound so great.
Way to go, Phoebe!
There was just one woman, wasn't there?
I know you probably don't want to go out with me, y'know because I make too many jokes and I've never been in a serious relationship and I guess I'm not technically a "doctor..."
Does anybody wanna split this with me?
I don't even wanna know about the dark cheese.
Joey, what are you gonna do when you have a baby?
Do we have to know about that?
People! People say it! Come here!
What people?
Y'know what, you can play with my dollhouse.
No, just a barrel.
Please! I made this game what it is.
I don't know who made you the boss? All right? We invented this game!
Did someone drop the baton again?
Yeah!
Phoebe, she sounded pretty upset to me.
Well, it seems like there weren't any tears 'til you showed her the bill.
So, you wore your nightie to dinner?
What's up with Gene?
And the fact that they're both monkeys.
I can see that, 'cause they both have those big brown eyes and, ya know, the little pouty chin.
Oh, god, I am so spoiled... That's it!
God bless the chickpea.
Cassie needs to stay at your place.
I'll be right with you.
Carol moved her stuff out today.
Cookie?
Well good, here let me help you out.
Well, it's going okay.
Honey? Is that something you're making up?
No! I'm up for a Soapie!
Chandler, please, come on. Look at him.
Hi, I'm Chandler. Your live-in boy
You bet! No TV or anything!
Does that mean I get the good loving tonight?
Good, they feel good, in my head.
Yeah, that's my job. Alright, look up. . . look down, now open your eyes, now look down. That's right, look into the light. Now look at me. . . OK. Your eyes look good. Those are good eyes.
Shut up! This place is a hole!
See, this is a great apartment.
Oh that's an eye removal machine.
Oh my God! What does that thing do?
It-it's so great to see you both here.
Charles.
That's right baby! Okay, what do I want now?
Yes! I've-I've never seen a roll like this in my life!
Fair enough, now go get ready!
Really?! Oh that's so exciting! Thank you! Thanks Mon! Oh but Mon, if you touch my guitar again I'll have to pound on you for a little bit.
Yeah! Joey has the best boyfriend ever!
Hey Chandler! Saw the new furniture. Very nice.
Ok fine. I'll handle this. Phoebe?
That would be advice!!
No, although now that's what I'm thinking.
Oh, ok. How, it's been so long since you've had sex, you're wondering if they've changed it?
Okay, d'y'see anybody you think could be me?
I think she means 'You dance a dance class'. Oh, c'mon, c'mon.
Wait-wait, go back to that sibling thing.
I don't know. Maybe maybe low self-esteem, maybe maybe to compensate for overshadowing a sibling, maybe you...
God, I'm sorry! I'll go back and get it!
Oh my God! There's a toe in my kitchen.
Oh! They're late and they're sloppy!
Ross' shirt is torn.
Just be yourself. But, not too much.
All right, I'm gonna do it! I'm gonna get shot down. Any advice?
Again. Y'know what? I think we all did.
Well, yeah, y'know how Ross and I were on again, off again, on again, off again? I guess I just figured that somewhere down the road, we would be on again.
He- he pooped in my shoe.
Oh no, how?
Freemont. West-Westmont, ah Westburg?
Yeah, what town are we near?
Grand Supreme Little Darling?
Pies, oh, we thought you said priiiize . Here! .
You mean you know Paul like I know Paul?
Paul the Wine Guy? Oh yeah, I know Paul.
Damn it, I did not think this through!
Ok, I'll fight for her. Ok! Oh, wait, oh I just realized... if I do that, that means you don't get her.
You made a joke right? So I laughed.
Why is that so funny?
Maybe we should just tell your parents first.
Yeah, I know. I hate it too. Look, maybe we should just tell them.
Y'know those are a delicacy in India.
Oh.
Because she's not gonna get to keep the babies.
Huh. Except, Phoebe's not gonna be the one that gets to dress them.
He is the man in the black dress.
Yeah! But I don't know what he looks like!
It's umm, it has something to do with transponding.
10 seconds, you need this or you lose the game.
You said you loved me! I can't believe this!
Nothing! I said, I said "You're so great" and then I just, I just stopped talking!
Joey, that paper's like a year old!
Awww! Mel Torme died.
You want a problem? I'll give you a problem!
Yeah, lady, I do! I got a problem with that!
Wait a minute, y'know, you're bringing me!
Not broad backed!
But then how do we know who wins?
All right, all right... I'll play if we don't keep score!
Look, I- I could go on pretending-
You know.. you let your guard down, you start to really care about someone, and I just- I-
What do you mean "what do we do"?
What do we do?
Well umm, Chandler and I are moving in together.
What's up?
What if he reads it in the paper?
Well, not for a little while. Let's just give him a few days to get used to everything else.
Fun? Fun, you think this is fun?
Why, why, why can't you stand me being here? I don't, I, we're just, ya know, we're just havin' fun.
Okay! Oh God, y'know what? It's really bad.
I'm not getting into this again!
Did the girl ever let you ride it?
Ohh.
I put three lasagnas in your freezer.
Yeah. Uh, does this mean there's nothing to eat?
Hey. Call me when you get there. Okay?
I will be okay! Look Chandler, you gotta get it out of your head that I can't take care of myself. Okay? Look, I'm not gonna miss you helping me out with money. The only thing that I'm gonna miss...is you. And now the dog.
My God! Is this a gym card?
All right that's it, school is in session!
Well, what made you make the exception for me?
Normally, I would not do it.
Yeah, like you're gonna be pregnant. I mean pregnant.
Honey, this really is an incredible thing to do for them, but there are things to think about.
So, we're just four losers... SUPER!
Nobody wins!
Y'know what, let's do the catering business.
No.
Stop sending food to our apartment.
Naa, she's lyin'.
These aren't for you! Are you upset?
Hey-hey!
I know. It's just such reckless spending.
Monica, would you calm down? The credit card people said that you only have to pay for the stuff that you bought.
How many kids were we gonna have?
Yeah.
Just figured, 'cause you and Ross are...
Why? What's the big deal?
Umm, listen there's something I think you should know.
Oh-hey-hey-hey! There you are!
And a lot could still get in our way.
Uhm, thank you, but we're really trying not to get our hopes up.
Hey-hey-hey. You wanna hear something that sucks.
Hey, Mon.
No, only because that's the graduation song.
Oh, that's The Wedding March. Does, does that freak you out?
Is it the same thing that Chandler had?
Yeah-yeah I uh, I have a uh, a guy problem.
So maybe we should just. . .
So.
All I say is, she better get the job.
OK, now wait a minute. That is the craziest typing test I've ever seen.
So Joey, why didn't you grow a moustache?
Just tryin' somethin' here, ya know.
Newark airport. Why, where are you?
What?
If Phoebe were my maid of honor...
Still.
But I thought you wanted to live by yourself.
See, this is the brilliance of the show. I say always keep them running. All the time, running. Run. Run Yasmine, run like the wind.
Yes Rachel, why do you care so much?
Why do you care so much?
Yeah huh!! Cover yourself up!
Whoa, ah!! We're you just gonna give me some lemonade?
Call them mom and dad you loser!
Umm, I'm sorry Judy, I couldn't find that bowl that you and Jack were looking for.
Oh my God! He's gonna rat me out!
Uh-huh.
No. Not after what happened with Steve.
Oh, come on! Come on!
I can't believe you're not gonna be here for Christmas.
Say goodbye elves, I'm off to Tulsa.
Let go! I'm a tiny little woman!!
Let go! Let go!
Come on, she'll be here any minute.
Yeah, yeah. I got a lemon schmush.
All right, all right, at least I'm prepared.
You just said... Of course you're my best friend. Would you please tell Rachel though?
Then get over yourself! Grow up!
Well, yeah!
Ohh, welcome to an adult relationship!
Really? Okay. Great!
Yeah-yeah, you remember how I call you bunny?
It's a sock bunny.
Umm, I-I really don't want to tell this story.
Which one?
All right, look at my on the back page.
Ohh! Oh, the Chelsea Reporter, ohh, this used to keep me so warm.
Because they'll know we've been listening.
Why not?! I'm hungry.
My boyfriend really does have good taste!
They look great! Does your boyfriend have the best taste or what?
Wow! Uh what, did he uh, say?
No-no-no, that's great! I'll be there Monday. And thank you again! Okay. Umm, that was the head of the Paleontology department at N uh, Y, uh U!
Oh, um, I don't know if that's a good idea.
So, you wanna get a hamburger or something?
Hey, you just got in 5 minutes ago!
I can't believe this, I thought we were all in this together!
Have you seen Rachel? Or a mirror?
Hey Monica!
If the school finds out you're fired.
Okay umm, bad stuff. Well, I'm-I'm 12 years older than she is.
Awww, come on-wait-stop it. Okay, to Monica.
It's okay, I want this to be your night too. To Monica.
Wow! It's like Rachel in High School.
Oh yes! Just had me a little nubbin-ectomy. Yep! Two nipples, no waiting.
I just can't stand you being here all the time.
Ow, ow, OK. Alright, alright, Mon, Mon, you've gone ultrasonic again, alright.
Hey, great skirt! Birthday present?
I know! Neither did I!
All right, we'll call you when we get back.
Thank you.
yeah oh my god, I'm so moved.
I can't believe you'd want us to raise Emma.
Umm. Umm. Umm. I don't think so.
Anyway, they want to take us out Saturday night! What do you say?
We heard about your pants, I'm so sorry.
Oh my God!
You know the words! You are so into this!
No, I'm not! And it wasn't a hop it was a pademarie.
Oh, so there is gonna be a fifth date?
No, it's, it's more of a fifth date kinda revelation.
Yeah you're right. I don't know what I was thinking.
I'm not macho.
Is-is-is there a-a Mrs. Stevens?
You're Elizabeth's father, huh? I can see now where she gets her rugged handsomeness.
Noo! I'll stay. He's my brother.
Uh, Pheebs we kinda need you to drive us all up there in your grandmother's cab, but y'know what, I'll stay.
Oh my God! Where the hell have you been?!!
There he is!
I mean I-I don't I think I have enough quarters.
Okay great, hold on a sec! Oh, here you go! You don't mind do ya? That would really help me out a lot! Thanks!
Who is also in charge of purchasing.
Ok, ok, here is to my sister, the newly-appointed head lunch chef--
She is unbelievable, our mother is...
Oh, maybe that's it.
You got the job?! Why didn't you tell me?
Yes!!!
Alright, we're gonna have to unscrew the chain.
It isn't working.
Harder than it sounds. Isn't it?
What?
Yeah, they do seem to feel pretty bad.
The floating heads do make a good point.
Why would the little girl creep you out?
Why would the baby creep me out?
Oh my god, I am losing my mind.
Yeah, I'm not so sure.
She's my favorite character on DOOL.
Noo!!
Oh my God, ice just got in my eye!
God, what happened?!
I knew you were likely to take a wife!
Yes.
Not one that can pee on the roof.
That's a dog, every house should have a dog.
So then, are you going to dump Jason?
Yeah, well he'd prefer water colors, but y'know, he has easy access to a lot of charcoal.
I proposed to Chandler! Alright, moving on...
Oh, I don't know, I don't know, isn't that a little desperate?
Only if you say his full name.
Oh, Monica, I figured I'd come by tomorrow morning and pick up Fluffy's old cat toy, OK?
How crazy that we'd run into you!
Ross!
You were my Midnight Mystery Kisser?
OH MY GOD!
So what? Don't you have any will power?
I messed up, it was a meeting, everybody was smoking.
So we can be friends who sleep together.
I'll call you back.
: But you don't remember sleeping with her.
well that's not even the weird part. I don't think she remembered sleeping with me.
I know you do. Me too. So what now?
God. I love you.
Relax. Y'know, she may not even know.
Thanks, but I gotta go to work and get my eyes scratched out by Mindy.
And she wants to go hunting, too!!
No, you can't go there! You know how I feel about these "big massage places"! They're putting people like me out of business!
I LOVE MY NEW JOB!
Hello? Hello?
This is just Bactine. It won't hurt.
I'm on top of the world, looking down on creation and the only explanation I can find, is the wonders I've found ever since...
: how do you know I have one of those?
oh and you know what you should bring the black see-through teddy with the attached garters.
Yeah, uh, it's actually not that big a deal.
So, uh, Jules tells me you guys are going shopping tomorrow?
Nothing. I don't kn-Umm. I don't know. Umm...
It's okay! Shh! Hey. Hey. Shhhh.
Yeah, apparently, they're pretty good seats.
Yeah, my mom got my dad's season tickets in the divorce, so she just gave them to me.
Y'know what, champ? I think I'll pass.
Well I just, thought maybe you'd wanna book some time with the best you'd ever had.
It's no big deal, I do it all the time.
Really?!
Shut up, and put my table back.
That wasn't a real date?! What the hell do you do on a real date?
Okay Phoebe, we should probably go back now.
Wait, we still have time to talk and they're-they're not even in the car yet! Oh look, there they go, okay.
Have you ever been to one of my weddings?
Right. Right. The wedding, gotcha. But I mean, it's gonna start a little late right? I mean, weddings start late. Right?
What? You bet I'd lose a nail?
It's nothing, it's just that now your Father owes me five dollars.
I'm sorry! It wasn't your whole toe!
That's why for an entire year people called me Sir Limps-A-Lot?!
Alright. Just keep him away from me.
Okay. He was more embarrassed about that than anyone. Okay? And for him to have the courage to walk back in here like nothing happened...
I might've said that. Why is that funny?
Really?! That's what you heard? You said that?
Are, are you kidding? This is packing?
Try it, I can't feel a thing!
Here you go! What do you think about centerpieces?
Okay.
Honey, I just don't think that you understood the joke.
Well, I just...
Oh yeah! What was his superpower again?
I know! And-and the worst part was they took my backpack which had all the original artwork I had done for my own comic book: "Science Boy"
So, um, how-how did you guys meet?
Yeah, I'm a big surprise.
Oh, hey! Oh good, you brought food!
Hey!
Please! I am not as bad as Ross.
Oh, hello, kettle? This is Monica. You're black.
Ok will do. So glad you came.
Alright, Monica dear, I'm gonna hit the road. Now I've left my 10 verbs on the table. And you be sure and send me that finished poem.
Oh my God! What were you doing in a library?
OK... my weirdest place would have to be... the women's room on the second floor of the New York CIty public library.
Still, I was quick as a cat.
Uh, you weighted 200 pounds.
Sure, we have no money, go ahead.
Yeah, well, we'll see about that. Can I use your phone? I just wanna call everyone I know.
I'm parked in a garage on Morton!
They're towing your car, they're towing your car!!
Can we just start throwing things in?
Ok, Pheebs, you know what, if we had that, we wouldn't be doing the ritual in the first place.
I don't know. Maybe we're some kinda magnets.
How did we end up with these jerks? We're good people!
Oh, George, baby, drop the towel!
He is so cute!
Hi Dad! I can still call you that right?
This is okay. We're all adults here; there's nothing to be ashamed of. Now, let's put our underwear in our pockets and walk out the door.
Ok, how about pilgrim Mockolate mousse?
It's not, it's not very Thanksgiving-y.
Oh, well... That had been your window.
He said: Are you seeing someone? And I said no...
Hey! How'd your date go with Jake?
Oh hey!
See ya.... Waitwait, what's with you?
Goodnight.
What about these? These look the same?
I am definitely gonna watch that!
So basically, this is a getting-rid-of-everything-Rachel-ever-used sale.
Yes, yes it is! No, but it's good it's-Emily thinks we should get all new stuff. Stuff that's just ours, together. Y'know brand new.
: Ok This is how much I love you.
well, well, well it must be five in Tulsa because it's six o clock IN NY.C!
Would you ever be a surrogate for anyone?
Oh!
She looks exactly like Aunt Marilyn.
Fine, she can stay at my place. By the way, what-what does Cassie even look like now.
My turn? What-what are you talking about?
Okay, I have to tell you something that I have never admitted during our entire friendship! But, when we were in high school I made out with James Farrell even when I knew that you liked him! Wow, that feels so good to get off my chest! Okay, you go!
Uhh, not much. Uh, work's good.
Well yeah, I do, but I decided to take a long lunch and spend some time with my friend Monica. Y'know I-I feel that we don't talk anymore. How are you? What is new with you?
Can you hear me say "You're grounded"?
Oh yeah, well can you picture me saying "Go to your room! You're grounded"?
When, when did-how, how did you...
Umm, no.
Rachel is not going to pick your stupid guy.
'Cause that's just your taste.
Oh, thank god! Emma, there you are!
Oh my god, then...
Thank you. My hair is very amused.
I like it. I do, I think it's a Ten.
Well I didn't want everyone to think I was stupid.
Out loud?
Rach, try holding her a different way.
Well alright, looks like you guys have got it under control so I'm just gonna go. No! Really? Misery really does love company. All right!
Yes... What is the end of that sentence?
...a what? A what? What's the end of that sentence?
No, too late. You can't give it back!
Well, why I told him it's haunted. Two can play at this game.
Okay, look, this could be a really long game.
The woman who cuts my hair!
How are we gonna do that? There's no way.
Well, we have gotta find out if he's alive.
You have scratches all over you, what happened?
Yeah?
Actually, I'm gonna go check on the twins.
Oh, don't worry, we'll find them.
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.
Yes, back then I, uh, used humor as a defense mechanism. Thank God I don't do that anymore.
We are talking about Rachel here. You and Rachel.
You got all that from saline solution?
Hey! What did you decide to do about the movie?
Oh my God! We have to throw her a shower?!
So umm, how was your date with Ginger?
Oh, I hate that. I once had a thing of half and half, stole my car.
It was Michelle. It was definitely Michelle.
Oh, great. It's starting to rain, that will make it easy to get a cab.
What about the part where he has rabies?
Yu-huh. That's when my mother would shut off the TV and say 'The end'.
Only if I don't have to get up and sing.
Oh before I forget, are you coming to Mike's piano bar tonight?
Yeah, a lot. A lot, a lot!
Oh Mon, listen I have to ask! Okay, Joey Tribbiani invited me back to his apartment, now does he do this with a lot of girls?
Do you really want to pull at that thread?
Oh my God! Those are my bedroom eyes?! Why did you ever sleep with me?
At least you took me down with you!
Let's get you out of here!!
I've gotta tell you, Bob is terrific.
Yeah, but it's not gonna last. She's too much for me in bed. Sexually.
Yeah, you miss alot, when you're moo-ing.
Yeah, I've been to these places before, but I've never really seen them, you know.
Why? 'Cause otherwise you'd go for it?
Damn! I can't believe I took her off my list.
Oh my God, the adoption lady is early!
Oh, yeah, that's the same, I am sure there are thirty different species of poisonous swings!
Oh my God, he's beautiful. Thank you so much.
Okay.
What happened to Santa, Holiday Armadillo?
I'm the holiday armadillo! I'm a friend of Santa's and he sent me here to wish you a Merry Christmas!
Do you mind telling us what it is?
Yeah, I kind of uh, have something else planned for you guys.
But you've only slept with two people.
Honey, you are not an oat. I, I mean I don't know, I, I guess I'm just not an oat guy. I've only slept with women I've been in love with.
Wha... How the hell is that gonna help?
What are you barking at?
Okay. Does it have to do with Ross and Rachel?
Well, sure in a perfect world. But, no, I promised I wouldn't tell, and I swore to like all my gods.
It's okay. I don't care. It's uh, it's fine.
Thank you for that! I was not flirting.
Hey Rach, aren't these candlesticks mine?
Uh-oh, saved by the bell. Hello?
Well, I think I shouldn't look directly at them.
Yeah. What do you think.
No because it-it didn't seem important.
So you came to the room looking for Joey? Did you ever in-intend on telling me about this?
I can't believe you guys are actually getting tattoos.
Okey-doke.
Oh, my fiancee wants the Swing Kings.
I know! I almost called off my wedding. Oh, who's your band?!
Are you gonna be ok, officer, uhm,...
Ooh, boy. You should warn people there's no elevator! I should not have had that Mexican food for lunch.
I'm dicing, I'm dicing, I don't hear anything.
The only man I've ever been with is your father.
Heads up Ross! Score! You suck!
Who cares, we'll eat at the sink! Come on, let's play!
People are supposed to wanna hang out here!
Yeah, I don't need it.
Well, that's it You gonna crash on the couch?
Welcome to the real world! It sucks. You're gonna love it!
How much did ever really win before?
So I really never get to win anymore?
Oh good, Lenny and Squigy are here.
Listen, while you're on a roll, if you feel like you gotta make like a Western omelet or something... Although actually I'm really not that hungry...
There is no alley behind Macy's.
Check it out man, I tore it off some mannaquin in the alley behind Macy's.
Ross, if you don't tell them, then I will!
Oh I am!
How did it go with Frank and Alice?
Hey!
Wow, those pills really worked, huh?
I feel great. I feel- great, I fleel great.
I'm sorry I almost made you sleep with Ross.
Anyway sweetie, I am, I'm so sorry I ruined your night.
Ross, you've got to do something about the humping.
Oh no, not in my room! I'll get him.
Well, I thought that I would cut up the tomatos.
So, uh, what are you going to do next?
Hi. Richard just told me he loves me.
Oh, hi.
Is that some kind of boat talk?
Chandler is a complex fellow, one who is unlikely to take a wife.
Yeah, I saw him waiting for an elevator.
Oh hey, Monica, I heard you saw Donald Trump at your convention.
Chandler! Chandler! I just figured out who you are!
Warm milk and Excedrin P.M.
So, you think you'll do it on his couch?
I know, I know. So sweet... and so complicated. And for a shrink, he's not too shrinky, y'know?
I guess I wanted to keep it as a souvenir.
Ahh-oy! That was the underwear I was wearing that night in London. Right Monica?
Hey, Rachel, Can-can I see you for a sec?
Oh, hi! I would check your hand but... I'm sure you don't want to get my chicken disease!
No Joey, I think he's just watchin' TV.
I ended up at Ross's place. Oh, I musta missed counted or something. Damn! She's not there anymore. Oh, l-l-look, Ross is doing his 'Watching TV' bit.
A monkey. Have you seen a monkey?
I wasn't ready for it.
So this is what a stroke feels like.
Ahhhh , you brought rats to my birthday party?
Because I don't work at the Szechwan Dragon.
Why?
Gotcha. When do we tell them about this?
I don't know what you mean, giant talking cigarette! Oh, by the way, Phoebe called just as I was getting into Nancy's car, so if she asks you, I was at work all day.
Noooo! I'm lying. I am so drunk.
Are you drunk?!
Hey, you think, you can keep it another night?
Fine, I'll give the suit back.
All the time. In fact, I was undefeated.
Oh-oh, yeah.
Well, high school was not my favourite time.
Eh. I thought that was an alp.
You gave my father a lap dance!
I know.
I don't remember. Do you wanna take a walk?
Oh yeah, what's it about?
Look at you, you won't even look at him.
Tell me what?
Yes Phoebe, but this is all I have. Okay?
Just get your nails done?
Hey! You smell like perfume and cigarettes.
Hi!
Joey just hired Chandler to be his assistant!
What?
yep, that's me, I am that stupid .
You are an idiot. .
Got the keys? or Got the keys!
Almost never.
Chandler stole a twenty from my purse!
What are you guys woofing about?
No. I can't be away from you for that long.
I'm sorry, are you just used to saying that?
It's so unfair, you don't even like your job!
Yeah, we have all this paperwork that needs to be filed by the end of the year. If I don't get it done, I'll be fired.
Or! A bakery delivery person.
What?!
Well, not... worried, just... wondering.
Monica, I started my day by peeing in front of twenty-five other women, and you're worried about who's gonna take you to the Big Apple Circus?
I'm sorry, Joey. I'm gonna go to bed, guys.
Yeah? That's so nice!
How many fingers am I holding up?
Okay, they are.
I can do it, okay? Come on, let's go.
I don't know, I mean you were a lot bigger, I mean, stronger back then.
Awww, just like you always wanted. Congratulations
Yes, his name is Barry, he's a doctor, thank you very much.
Oh, no thanks, we're just here to observe.
May I help you?
And! We also have speaker phone.
Yeah.
No. But I remember people telling me about it.
Oh, man. Oh, remember when I stuck that broom in your bike spokes, and you flipped over and hit your head on the curb?
Oh, y'know what, I can't, it really kills.
Open it up, let me see.
Has somebody been drinking my fat?
Look, our table is down in front, okay, my boss is gonna be there, everyone will see if we arrive after it starts.
Listen, I... I don't think this is the best time.
Is that him again? Tell him I'd come to the phone, but my ankles are weighin' me down.
Richard's living room, drinking wine.
Relax every muscle in your body. Listen to the plinky-plunky music. Okay, now close you eyes, and think of a happy place. Okay, tell me your happy place.
Let's see, today's Monday... Never.
So when do we get to meet the guy?
All I have is, is oregano and a Fresca.
Ok, so now we need, um sage branches and the sacramental wine.
Or "Win, Lose or Draw".
Except for "Match game"...
Chandler, you have to tell Joey that you're not in Tulsa.
Yeah, but, ah, ah, nothing has to happen. We're just having fun. You know, not everything had to go as far as "eye-contact."
..I dunno, a little too Alan?
What?
No, we haven't seen her since this morning.
You guys know where Rachel is?
Yeah, I tried to gnaw myself free.
Some of these look a little frayed.
You can not play bagpipes at the wedding!!
Well yeah-yeah the Scottish history is so much more...
Hey, Joey, what would you do if you were omnipotent?
Hey Joey. Hi. Hey, buddy.
Oh God, maybe he won't see us. Richard!
What?! I'm Chandler! Oh, that's Richard!
Making holiday candy for the neighbors.
Hey.
I hear ya. Excuse me for just a second!
Uh-huh.
Shhh! We just got her to go to sleep.
Hey!
Right now, Joey and Chandler's, go now.
What?
So, do you want me to watch Ben for you?
Well, they painted over the word 'Sapien' for one thing, then they rearranged the figures, let's just leave it at that.
That's right, because I forbid you to smoke again.
'kay, look: Can we just drop this? I'm not gonna smoke again.
Could've played Monopoly, but nooooo.
Okay, Monica: Right foot red.
Oh yes! I have it right here, on ice!
Did you bring the toe?
Is he crazy?! You just had Ross's baby!
Joey proposed to me.
Oh look, and he did my crossword puzzle.
Ooh, goooosh, ooh, these are cookies smashed in the sports section.
No! But I know exactly what I'm going to say.
Right. So uh, have you written yours yet?
Well at least, I'm going to mute it.
Imagine a protective porn bubble if you will, okay?
I'm really getting tired of sneaking around.
I guess I'll get washed up then. Watch that sunrise.
Yes it is! You saw me wearing it!
No!
Joey, this is for you. It's blackberry curin.
Hey Mon.
Hey, don't blame me for wigging tonight!
Oh, I'm sorry, am I getting in the way of all the room switching fun?
I promise you, he would definitely want you back.
You really think he'd take me? I mean, we had a pretty good talk last night but, when I moved out, I hurt him bad.
Oh please, you just want more blue pins.
Y'know I think we should invite them.
Hey, Rachel, isn't that stuff almost pure...
And here we have the last of Paulo's grappa.
Well, go over to her! She's not with anyone.
She's amazing! She makes the women that I dream about look like short, fat, bald men!
Dad, Chandler was just laughing at your joke.
Ok, I have dandruff. There's no need to laugh and point.
Was he falsely accused of something?
No, he's in prison.
Yeah! Yeah! His name is Chandler and...
It's so nice to see you! Both of you! Look at me. Look how young I look! Oh gosh! We have so much to catch up on! But first things first: touch my abs I don't exercise at all! Oh gosh, so Monica, you're married!
Oh, it is sooo perfect. Thank you so much.
So you like it?
Yes you did. You absolutely sold me...
I did not sell you out.
Uh, look, officer... uhm Sir...
Oh, you're mean!
Do you want to go out on a date with her?
Well, of course.
Oh my God! Fog him! Fog him!
Arghhhh!!!!!!
A hat! Yes! We need a hat.
Or. We could put a hat on his head.
Why, what's wrong with my bathroom floor?
Oh Monica, listen, I ah, I saw down at the hardware store, they got those designer tiles on sale. If you ever want to redo the bathroom floor.
Oh, sweetie. Oh, look at you. You're shivering.
What?!
How about a Youhoo with a funny straw?
Actually, I don't like martinis.
You faked it? You couldn't have faked it!
Yeah, you can fire her, but I would call security, she won't go easy.
Oh gosh, Phoebe, I think I caught your cold.
I don't know. I can't--I just, I can't get her out of my head. Y'know? I mean, I'm a very bad person. I'm a very, very bad person. I'm a horrible person. No you're not Chandler! We still love you Chandler!
Well, can't you just have the party when we get back?
We're having a party.
Yes, I would like something. No, no thank you.
Can I get you something from the bar?
Okay, look at this one. This is my favourite.
Little village people.
That'll teach you to lick my muffin.
So wait, this guy goes down for like two years at a time?
Uh, Rach, it's the Visa card people.
Ooh! Ooh! And I brought Operation! But, um, I lost the tweezers, so we can't operate. But we can prep the guy!
I'm sick of Japanese. We're not going there.
Oh, oh, I love that Japanese place.
Oh. Well did you get it? Let me see.
Oh.
Blow drying what, you have no hair.
Calm down, I'm blow drying.
I have not been sick in over three years!
Honey, no one thinks you're a pansy, but we do think you need a tissue.
Yes you did! You did like a little hop.
No I didn't.
What are you talking about? These aren't mine.
Oh, yes. I decided to leave these out for you in case Richard stops by and you wanna engage on a little light bondage and moustache play!
I know the code to his answering machine.
Monica, how are you gonna do that?
There's an ad for a naked chef?
Wait, here's one. Uh, would you be willing to cook naked?
But, we pick again! We pick again!
Yeah baby!
Okay, don't miss that flight. You know I love you.
Really...? See... that's the thing: you gotta keep it smart, people!
So you gave in and decided to call someone?
Hi!
Can you believe he just offered me a restaurant?
What?! Oh.
Oh, are the drapes still closed hon?
I'm good.
I'm just so excited to make the presents! Shoot!
What?
Ross! He's playing with my spatulas again!
Aah, y'killing me!
Oh, please, that is such a lame excuse!
Oh, yeah, right.
I knew that! Rachel! Use you're head!
I'm afraid the TV Guide comes to Chinandolor Bong.
Phoebe, why is there a dog in our apartment?
Hi Geller-Bing residence. How can I help?
And I'm a wuss. And we should be partners.
Yeah. I'm a hard ass.
: Eww are you talking about my bother.
Ah! You know what honey guys are just different, they like things that we can't understand, you know I once dated this guy who wanted to pretend he was an archeologist and I was a naughty cave woman that he unfroze from a block of ice.
OK, if you say stop, then we stop.
Because it's Sunday. It's God's day.
Hi. It is so, so nice to meet you.
Monica, Chandler. I'd like you to meet Erica.
Damnit Phoebe! How did you even call him?
I'm sorry, I broke down... I wanted to see him.
When it's your assistant, I would say never.
Interesting.
Great. So the ball is in his court?
Yeah, but he waited until the last minute! So if I said yes, he would know I had nothing better to do than wait around for an invitation to his stupid party. I said, "No!" Which puts me right back in the driver seat.
No, I'll do it. You just stick to your job.
Do you want me to call?
Ethan, focus. How could you not tell me?
I just had sex.
Wow, do you mean like kiss him-kiss him?
Ok, well this is like that...in no way. I had a...I had a dream last night that I wanted to kiss Joey.
Oh my God! I have nothing left to teach you!
Oh, well. Everything that I need is in here and my travel documents are on the counter organized in the order that I will be needing them.
Still get a discount on wedding dresses?
Anyway, Ralph just came in to tell me that he's so happy with my work that he wants me to be the new merchandising manager for polo retail.
Didn't your dad used to call you Pumpkin?
All good, thanks. Do you maybe have a nickname have like a nickname that's easier to rhyme?
Oh, would you let it go already?! You're fine!
Yeah, right, he almost danced me right down that...garbage chute.
Look, you and I went to different high schools...
I mean why, of all people would you want to go out with Chip?!
Oh, you're totally welcome! What'd she say?
Thank you.
Rach, there's something uh, important I have to tell you.
Okay, bye!
You're not gonna believe this. Okay, so I go over...
Tell us!
Hey, we're probably fertile, let's go home!
Ah ahahahhahaa! How great is this!
Do you really see this as a long-term thing?
Wait a minute, all jokes aside? I didn't agree to that!
How about at a game, on the big screen?
Ok, ok, so how should I do it?
Oh Soap Opera Digest award!
No-no.
Well, we're still talking about it, aren't we?
And; people thinking it's huge has led Monica to believe that we are stealing her thunder. Which we are not!
Okay. Well, it's good news. It's good news.
I love you, love you.
Sure, every time, you're such a princess...
I am not a baby! You know what? I swear to god, just because you get so uptight every time we...
Are you serious? You still see Dr. Gettleman?
I know. Ross still sees his pediatrician!!! I don't care!
Very good! What do you need it for anyway?
A place to eat spaghetti.
Yeah, hi, it's Monica. I just got a page.
And we don't work hard?
Hey, we can take her back with you if you want.
I'm sorry, sweetie.
Check your numbers! Make me rich!
Mum, please!I know you love your new lips, but I can barely understand you! Would you, please, just let me say goodnight to my daughter? TV: "And number 29! Here we go! The Powerball is 7"
I don't know, I lost it all ok. I lost it.
Why, when did you get out of the game?
Hey Chandler! Did you like the macaroni and cheese?
Monica!
My boyfriend said he didn't like my massages.
What?
You know, the guys are probably having a great time.
Yeah, I mean, it would be rude to them for us to leave now.
When Rachel was with Paulo, what did you do?
Oh yeah, sure, that makes sense. Yeah. 'Cause you already told her you love her and she didn't say it back, then she called you and told you that there's another guy, so yeah, go to London that'll scare her!
Ross, when's this comet thing start?
Why?! Why on the lips?!
Well, the giraffe's okay. And so is the pirate.
All right. Did everyone get out okay?
Y'know, I try to stay positive. . .
I mean, if it were me, I think I'd have difficulty just getting out of bed at all.
Well y'know Joey, you're a pretty charming guy.
Apparently, there's like a million guys out there that can play Mac, and there's only this one robot and this one guy who controls it! I didn't know he could get me fired! What am I going to do?
Ohh, everybody at the restaurant still hates me.
What's wrong Mon?
I'm still not done not wanting to talk to you.
Monica.
I'm sorry, why is this girl going to call me?
Aw, Mom...
Wait a minute. I thought last night was great.
That, that is funny. That is painfully funny. No, wait. Wait, yeah, that's just painful
Phoebe, you have a, a twig in your hair.
Oh yeah, it's so cool. Now I gotta go, Officer Bing has gotta, 10-100. That's pee-pee.
I've been great, just great. How have you been?
Hi Phoebe, nice to meet you. So, how ya been?
You know, that guy she met at the coffeehouse.
Oh. Hey, who's Carl?
Nice to meet you! My God you're great!
You are so beautiful.
I haven't really settled on a spot yet!
Wow! Oh, she's so nice and big! Oh, Monica, where are you going to display Gladys oh so proudly?
Then, I'd steer clear of Phoebe.
Okay, if you'll excuse me, I-I'm gonna go hang out with some people who don't know the Space Mountain story.
Okay. Okay, I'm ready. Come on big fella!
I was giving you some of my best moves, and you missed it. So please wake up so we can do it right!
How do you know exactly what she's going through?
Yeah, I know exactly what she's goin' through.
What do you have against the beautiful guest room?
Which is why Asteroids is perfect! It's the oldest game!
If you're not going then I don't want to go either.
I can't go to my own prom without a date, I can't, it's too late.
What, what are you doing? You can't go out there.
Y'know what, I don't think we should listen to this anymore.
Oh, right, right. How was your date, 'Chand-lrr'?
Well, I can't believe I've been here almost seven seconds and you haven't asked me how my date went.
Well, it just seems like a really small number.
What? Alright, what about my two?
She and Phoebe took the stripper to the hospital.
Hey, where's Rachel?
Chandler, would you like some more orange juice?
Okay, one more time.
Have I read it? No, are you enjoying it?
Flowers of Evil, by Beaudalire. Have you read it?
Hey, at least I knew where my guy was.
What's with the kissing?
You are insane! You-you gotta give this up!
I'm fine! I'd fight tonight, if they'd let me. See this circle I'm marking off here? This is my zone of terror.
Phoebe, he's gotta be in the room for that to work.
Yeah, swing music is so out.
What?! I just touched him and he went over.
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What's with the tackling?
This is harder than I thought it would be.
Yeah. I guess so.
Man, I feel like I'm coming down with something.
Sure I can, standard shotgun rules, I'm sight of the room and I called it.
Well, tonight was-was going to be my first time.
Okay. What was tonight?
He was so good in that movie of MacBeth.
Yeah, yeah, and directing.
You-you're gonna have to put your foot down?
Look, I understand, but I have to put my foot down. Okay? The answer is no.
Yeah. I hope she can kick his ass.
I hope Ben has a little sister.
Hey, this afternoon you said you'd be supportive...
What? No, no, no! No, no... no... no, no... No, too much is changing, okay? First, Phoebe getting married Congratulations! ... and then these two move into a stupid house in the stupid suburbs...
All right. Honey, that's-that's a sleeve. Okay?
What?! Monica, I'm scared!!
The park huh? A public place.
We did! We violated Section 12 Paragraph 7 of the criminal code!
OK, how does everybody like their burgers?
Ooooh.
Thank you. I think I just had a tiny orgasm.
Everything is broken down into categories, and then cross-referenced, and then colour-coded to correspond with the forms in the back.
Oh my god, honey, I'm so so so so so sorry.
Oh, Very funny... Joey. Chandler: So, how did you enjoy the play?
All right, Phoebe get open. Rachel, go long.
Okay. Oooh! Oh, this is our last huddle, yeah.
Hey, it's Funny's cousin, Not Funny.
Oh, oh that's right, I forgot about your ability to fuse metal.
Phoebe, we are so proud of you! You're amazing!
So, here you are. It seems like yesterday I was talking to you in that little petri dish. Everyone said labor was the hardest thing I'd ever have to do, but they were wrong this is. Oh, I had the most fun with you guys! I wish I could take you home and see you everyday. Okay, I'll settle for being your favorite Aunt. I know Alice's sister has a pool, but you lived in me. Okay, so we're cool. Yeah, we're gonna be great. Little high fives! Ahh! Ahh! Ahh! Well, if you're gonna cry.
We're really glad you decided to meet our guy.
Hi!
Okay, let's go!! Let's hit the road!!
It's never taken you more than a shower to get over a relationship.
Okay, stop it Phoebe, you're getting me all tingly.
Oh, great! We couldn't keep our eyes off each other all night and then every once and a while y'know, he'd kinda lean over and stroke my hair and touch my neck.
You wanna be in charge of the food committee?
Question. Why do we always have to have parties where you poach things?
Thank you for letting us see the house again.
Oh... Little heads-up would have been nice.
Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't do this.
Oh, come on, now you know you want 'em.
I don't want him to think that I'm having an affair.
Don't you think it's better for him to think that you're cheating on me, than for him to think that I'm cheating on him? I heard it.
Great. It's gym class all over again.
Okay. And, my, dead, mother, says, you, are, it. I'm with Rachel.
Sure, we'll do that. What are you up to?
I was just asking 'cause I need someone to watch Emma tonight.
Four, please. I'm really nervous. Thank you.
Hot dog?
Ooh, chocolates on the pillows! I love that!
I can't believe it! We're here!
How does that laugh not give you a headache?
Well, maybe I'll bring it out and have Monica stick her finger in it. That oughta sweeten it up, huh?
Chandler one time wore my underwear to work!
Of course it is. Wow-whoa!
So! I'm just an empty vase, huh?
Remember how you said you were really dense about poetry? Oh.
What are you guys doing? Oh my God, is that Richard?
You don't wanna see what I just saw!
Yeah, but y'know we could sneak in and watch.
Well, we're a little early, the lecture doesn't end for 15 minutes.
Oh, thanks! We'll try to stop by.
Hey guys, I just uh, wanted to invite you to the party tomorrow night.
Other wall, people! Other wall!
Thanks! Thank you!
It's a traditional Mexican custard dessert.
Excuse me?
Is it better than the other salmon mousse?
Mmmm. Good.
Ross! The neighbors ate all my candy!!
Hey Mon, you might wanna make some more lasagna too, because something might've happened to a huge chunk of it.
You know what? Then, Joey, we want you to do it.
I gotta a lot of nice stuff to say about you guys, ok? And I know how much you wanna have a baby, you know, and I would love to help you get one.
Roger wants to take her out tomorrow night.
Do what, do what?
Monica and I just crashed an embassy party.
Where the hell've you been?
Huh. What's doofus spelled backwards?
That's 'help' spelled backwards so that the helicopters can read it from the air!
Ooh, candy bars, crossword puzzles...
Well, remember when they got in that big fight and broke up and we were all stuck in her with no food or anything? Well, when Ross said Rachel at the wedding, I figured it was gonna happen again, so I hid this in here.
How 'bout one last game of racquetball?
I know I couldn't. So....
You're not gonna be here New Year's Eve??
Thanks. I'll see you New Year's Day.
Look at you! Come here! Feel better?
No.
Oh my God, Joey, that is such a great tip.
So what's really neat. If you sear the stems of the flowers first in a frying pan, your arrangement will look fresh much longer.
Pick a number! That is your only job!
Okay, ah umm, ah, a 8. Ah, a 6?
Oh, oh, okay umm, so I'll see you soon.
Ah, no it's not. I've got picture-in-picture here. Yeah. Yeah, okay. I'm gonna have to call you back later. Monica? You. I'm gonna have to call you back.
Hi Chandler. It's really nice to see you NOT.
Hi Monica.
If you tell me, I'll tell you what Phoebe said.
Oh no-no, I can't do that.
Because! You could get to live out my fantasy!
And why do you care so much?
Ok, it is definitely less than a ballpark.
Woah, woah, no wait a minute now. C'mon it's your turn. Oh c'mon. Ya know, I don't need the actual number, just a ballpark.
I think somebody needs another lap dance.
Ohhh!!
Ross, your little creatures got the remote again.
It doesnt matter. You dont dip your pen in the company ink.
Hey, it was very moving! You're just heartless!
I've heard the speech: "if he knew it was gonna be the last time he saw her... "
Now I love you. And not just 'cause I have to.
I can't believe you hated me.
I didn't say your songs were not good enough.
Ok, we're still on that.
Who cares? He works in a museum!
Op, y'know what though, it's kind've a girlie briefcase.
I wanted it so bad! Wanna go pack?
That's right! It was the wrong kind of eight, no wedding! Damnit!
Phoebe, there's a dog sitting on my couch!
I'm sorry, who's this?
That's right, she came back all by herself.
Clunkers?! Oh my god!
Hey! Maybe the monkey will be at the audition!
I know. When the monkey hits him in the face with that giant rubber phone.
Michael Flatley, Lord of the Dance!
According to Chandler, what phenomenon scares the bejeezus out of him?
: you don't think sharks are sexy do you?
What?
Would you look at her? She is so peaceful.
I cannot sleep in a public place.
Ok, three kinds of potatoes coming up.
Well, 'cause then they'd be like my mom used to make them, you know, before she died.
Well, then, I'm okay with being high maintenance.
Yeah, totally.
Chandler, I don't even wanna see the musical Oklahoma!
The Sooner State, whatever that is.
I don't know. I don't know. It's just going to be so great!
And Monica, what are you going to make?
Oh yeah...So how did you end up kissing?
It was the end of the party, you were probably ironing wrapping paper.
I-I already told him everything! You shush!!
Oh, is that funny?! Oh, you-you find that funny?! Well maybe Chandler should know some of your secrets too!
Is this the one that I threw out last year?
Well look no further, this one's yours! Ahhh.
It will not be fine. We'll get in trouble.
Okay, listen, I'm thinking, why don't we just tell them who we really are? I mean, it'll be fine, I really think it'll be fine.
Uhh, y'know actually I was gonna do some laundry.
Hey Mon, what are you doing now? Wanna come see a movie with us?
Yeah, I think I have some around here somewhere. Why?
Oh, hey, Mon, do you still have your like old blouses and dresses from high school?
All right, come on, I'm-I'm late for work!
I don't know.
The wedding is off, sloppy and immature!
Technically we could have sex again. What do you think, bossy and domineering?!
We don't do that! Tell her we don't do that!
Uh huh...we're playing you two.
She doesn't have a stomach-ache. She's in labor!
Relax! We'll just get her some antacids.
Oh, wait, wait, wait! Here they go again.
That's alright. Listen, listen.
Change! Okay, sit down. Two seconds.
A wandering?
Oh, Janine, the really hot dancer girl?
Oh, oh, we did say we'd stop by this little thing Joey's roommate is having.
Of course! Joey wouldn't let you have one?
Y'know when we move in together, can I get a gumball machine?
I can cook and you can take care of the money.
Okay!
Well, what kind of food is he looking for?
Yeah, yeah!
Yeah, two hours, a lifetime that's the same.
I don't know why I was so nervous about this. And I don't know why Frank and Alice are always complaining. This is so easy.
Wow! I can't believe I actually rolled an eight.
Eight! Easy eight.
Yeah! And the winner gets a hundred bucks.
Yeah, and none of these stupid grocery questions, real personal questions.
All weekend? That's a whole lotta naked.
I know, me too. Hey! Y'know what if we went away for a whole weekend? Y'know we'd have no interruptions and we could be naked the entire time.
No, I want everything you just said. I want a marriage.
Sure you do.
Rachel, it's a world where Joey is a neuro-surgeon.
Well how can that be, you were just kissing Sabrina?
Oh, that was our favourite game show ever!
Things you find in the ocean, You're gonna be on "Pyramid"!!
Guys. I thought you were taking Ross to the game?
Okay, may I see the comics?
Danny. Are you guys ever gonna go out again?
Two pounds of Moca Java please.
No I didn't. I asked, "got the ke-eys?"
Yes, you do. When we left, you said, "got the keys."
No, not if their room has two beds!
Uh, don't you think that would be a little weird? I mean, two guys in a romantic inn...
Well I'm Monica Geller, ball like a baby.
Wow you look so beautiful! If I knew you, I'd cry.
Hello? Hold on please. Joey, it's your mom.
So, what did you guys think?
Whose little ball of paper is this?!
Yeah, sorry, the swallowing slowed me down.
That's also like the tenth time you told us.
That's like the tenth time I've peed since I've been here!
Okay, umm, okay, umm... It's just Joey and Ross.
Y'know what, just give me a second and I'll be out of your hair. I'm just gonna grab a jacket. When I get back, I want every little detail. Maybe that's him.
This Thanksgiving kicks last Thanksgiving's ass!
I'm so happy for you!
I mean think about all the money that you're gonna make!
Yeah.
What is wrong with this freezer?! Ow! Ow!!
Thanks.
I don't think you'll ever get my parents that drunk!
Hey, I can be pretty charming, babe, I won YOU over, didn't I?
Any woman would be lucky to have ya.
No Monica! I'm serious! Oh, maybe I should just forget about it. Become a lesbian or something.
Base Unit! Think Monica! Think!
There is a speakerphone on the base unit...
Ross, how long have you been planning this wedding?
Excuse me?
Yeah you will! And, are you kiddin' me?!
And I will cook anything you want in here , and do anything in there!
Stop with the broom, we're not making noise.
"Oh, Chandler, now, now, that's it. There, faster!"
He hates me. My nephew hates me.
Cool.
Oh no! You and Phoebe are gonna help me in here.
Oh, yeah, yeah, good idea.
My parents spent the money for our wedding!
Well what happened at dinner?
It's a globe and, a pencil sharpener.
What is this?
Oh God, is it 6:30? Buzz him in!
It's, uh, it's Paul.
No! Joey, we swore we'd never tell!
All right.
Oh, wait, is he the guy I met at Christmas?
Okay, I thought of the joke two months ago at lunch with Steve.
So what. So he drank a lot tonight.
Ooooooh.
Where are we gonna find a tiny little hat?
We need a hat..
Fantastic! I have one question: How is that possible?
WE WON!! Thank you! Yes!
I hadn't! Photo 152 was a prototype.
Oops. Sorry! Well, good thing you number all of them, huh?
Oh, I'm sorry. Shoot, they were doing it before.
Monica? Monica, Monica, Monica, Monica..?
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god!
Ross kissed me.
Oh wait, Joey, you can't go like that! You stink!
Oh my God! I overslept! I was supposed to be on the set a half an hour ago! I gotta get out of here!
Boy, that was-that was, umm... terrific.
Oh my God! Play!
Why? Do you think he's still mad at us?
Hey, does anybody else feel bad about Ross?
I'm sorry, I'm just excited about being an aunt!
Waitohheyhuh, oh great now he knows, and I don't know!
Ross, you did not come up with "got milk?"
You know, if I didn't already have a job, I think, I would have been really good in advertising.
Fresh cookies! Hot from the oven!
I don't know, it smells good.
Oh my god, where's Emma? Where's Emma?
Where's Emma?
Gary's gonna ask you to move in with him!!
So, what movie should we see?
No-no, Rachel, don't get it! He can't see us!
Oh, okay!
It's all everybody at the party could talk about!
Ahh, third base.
I think that is so great! When are you gonna ask her?
What do you, what do you think?
Oh, my mother's right. I'm never going to get married.
Because he's crazy. Okay? He came up to me earlier and thanked me for my very moving performance in Titanic.
Oh really? When? Do you wanna do it with me?
No you are not! You are sweet and wonderful and this is gonna happen for you.
We'd be eating our soup right now.
Richard used to do it, didn't he?
I think I'll help her out. What is going on here?
Okay.
Oh my God! How cute is the on-call doctor?
I'll be right with you. Okay? Thanks, Wendy.
Well, her father pays you for baby-sitting right?
Why? What?
Well, unless goose is a vegetable...ha haaaah!
Uh-huh.
Okay. So what do you.... you think she's faking?
Pay the caterer! Look, I've had a lot of jobs, okay, and there are some people who just always try to get out of paying. It's either, you know, "that massage wasn't long enough, or, "I don't recognize any of those songs," or, you know, "these sombreros aren't big enough. Bad little white girl!"
Ya know, you had no right to go out with him.
Alright Monica, if there is something that you would like to share...
Well, I guess we won't be warming his house.
Okay, see ya.
I cannot believe you broke up with her just like that.
Pretty much, yeah.
Oh no, she's out having drinks with Carl.
Hey, is Rachel here? Um, I wanted to wish her a happy birthday before I left.
He's in the bathroom. I don't think you wanna go in there!
Where's Joey? His mom's on the phone.
Awww, look at Aunt Monica's little boy!
And here's little Ben nodding off...
That's it! Take it! Take it! Take it!
Aww!
Oh no, two days, you must be bummed.
Oh yeah, she's-she's amazing. And-and she's so much fun. And! Y'know what? When I'm with her, I'm fun! I even signed up for helicopter classes. She's leaving in two days, I don't have to do it.
All right, get your coat, we're going to the hospital.
Either that or my mouth is getting smaller.
I mean, my feelings for Richard are certainly gone.
Yeah.
Wow, the boyfriend's parents! That's a big step.
Listen! You have to help me pick a dress 'cause I'm meeting Mike's parents tonight!
Sush!! I cannot believe she is still up there.
Oh, well then, if anybody should have a party it should be him.
Yo, Bing. Racquetball in 15 minutes.
No, I felt it on my hip. You could tell.
Alright. I'm gonna go change, I've got a date.
Oh, no! I- I can't drink this now!
Phoebe, why is smoke coming out of the bathroom?!
Oh what do you know? Virgin!
You know that? You don't want to spoil your appetite.
Ah, cool! Taco shells! You know, these are... they're like a little corn envelope.
Oh. Monica! ...Hi. I'm Mo- ...nana.
Hi. I'm Monica.
I know you're planning my surprise bridal shower.
What?!
Yeah, yeah, and you were going him y'know, your flower.
Well, you know that my parents are out of town and Chip was going to come over...
Ross you know that tonight is your date with Hillary?
A-A day.
...horribly attractive. I'll be shutting up now.
Hey, Joey.
Mm-mh. I printed them out on my computer.
You won awards?
What if something gets broken, they're so expensive.
Honey, she keeps canceling on us, take the hint.
So you stole that tape from Richard's apartment?
So...? What do you think?
All right boys, last chance for the tickets!
That's too hard. Too hard!
You mean the guy who kept calling you Ron?
I don't know. I could talk to her boss. Yeah! I met him at that Christmas party. We really hit it off.
You know what. Tomorrow I'm gonna do your clocks.
Thank you.
Nothing, um, it's just, um... It's Roger.
So what's going on?
I hope you cleaned your hair out of the drain.
All yours.
Let's see, 1939... yeah, 24, 25?
Wow, Monica, you look just like your grandmother. How old was she there?
O-kay, so you wanna play it that way, do you?
No thanks, I'm good.
Look. Joey, do you know we can see you from here?
Yeah.
You'd better hope I don't see you in the hallway!!
Y'know I think you can take her.
So guys, listen, I go over there, and umm...
Keep on scooching.
Sounds like she's got the ah, whole package.
Great. It was great. She's ah, she's great, great looking, great personality, she's greatness.
Oh, I was thinking about having people over for the game.
Oh yeah!
Yeah, I don't hear Chandler's and he doesn't hear mine.
Oh, can we read them?
Hey! Didn't you have that outfit on last night?
Hey!
Those are my eyes! Those are my breasts.
Yeah, except your breasts look kinda small.
My God, you can't even look at me! Can you?
Pass the cheese, please.
Besides, it takes the focus off the hat.
Right.
Yeah you're right, we can't-we shouldn't watch this.
We can't watch that! I mean that's Phoebe!
I want you to know, it wasn't me who turned you in.
That I was not expecting.
I wanna wake up early and go get it for you!
You have done enough!
You should go to the game. It's okay. I want you to.
What?
Wait a minute! My last Kit-Kat bar!
Aww.
This is the most special day of our lives.
Wow! Hello, Mr. Chandler.
Hey, I've come to terms with it, you have to too.
Oh no.
Well if you want a problem? I'll give you a problem!
You bet I do! I just ah, wasn't listening then, that's all.
Remember it? What do you think this is, a freckle?
Yeah. Hey, remember the time I jammed that pencil into your hand?
Yes, they are. The Blymens invited them.
No, they're not.
Well, if you wanna get a drink later we can.
Anyway, I should go, one of the lifeguards was just about to dismantle a nuclear device.
Hey Rach, could you get me some cough drops?
Well where's Amanda?
Wait a minute, I can get ice at the restaurant...
Cups and ice? Ooh, I get to be in charge of cups and ice? All right. Fine, okay, I will be in charge of cups and ice!
No... Either of you girls got a quarter?
To see who goes first, you got a quarter?
Oh damn the jellyfish. Damn all the jellyfish!
Yeah, and I'm a little tired from digging the hole.
It's okay. Chandler, are you afraid of me or something?
Okay look, don't...don't be mad okay? But after I unpacked the boxes I wanted to do something nice for you, so, I-I-I cleaned the apartment. So I moved everything around and then I forgot where it, where it went back and I'm sorry, I'm very sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Don't worry about it Phoebe, we'll absolutely do it.
Please! Please! Please! Please! Oh please! Please! Please! Frank and Alice asked me to baby sit the triplets and I'm nervous 'cause I've never done that before by myself!
Damnit Ross, get your butt out of the bathroom.
I'm sorry, my pie was, was in your hood. Now I just have to get the coffee out of that guy's pants and I'll be back in the hospital by 7.
...I think he deserves a Nobel Prize.
Oh yeah, I totally agree.
That's my favourite kind! Okay, we are doing this!
Am I? Really? Am I? Well, why don't you cook Thanksgiving dinner and prove me wrong! Well, think about it, think about it, you'll be trying to top than you did last year. You'd be in competition... with yourself.
Get up. Come on. Let's get some coffee.
Mmmm. Not tonight, honey. I got an early day tomorrow.
Ooh, are we allowed to lie in the vows?!
Ennnh.
It's your suitcase. We're going to Las Vegas.
What's this?
: I cannot tell you how happy that makes me!
yeah just some good old fashion girl on girl American action.
Rache, I think we have enough regular lamps.
Monica, Monica, look at this lamp. Is this tacky or what? We have to have this.
"To take you to his mansion in the sky-y?"
Like an X-Ray. Bad day not to wear a bra.
No, Rachel never pees in public restrooms.
No. Thank you.
You jerk! You know how much I love that kid!
I hope it's still funny when you're in hell.
What-what are you doing? Is this supposed to be funny?
It's Joey.
Joey, I thought you were gonna try to be friends first!
Uhh, well, she's...really good in bed.
You've got to get back out there, it's your party.
I'll cancel the sodas.
Alright, Cincinnati, no blinds, everybody ante.
That's fine. I'll just have a Tic-Tac to hold me over.
No! We're gonna have fun. We can make fudge!
What a pity stay?
Wow! I'm-I'm-I'm glad you smashed her watch!
Two years.
Hey. There you are. You disappeared after dinner.
There's your movie! Later on. Monica opens her front door. Chandler is sitting in the hallway.
Ohhh, ooohhh... you are on a roll, mister!
You know, I don't mind a... male nanny, but I do draw the line at a male wetnurse.
No. You know, sometimes just things doesn't work out.
Are you not seeing him anymore?
We're supposed to meet my parents in 15 minutes.
Am I naked again?!
Y'know what? You're right Phoebe. You're right. Thank you!
So go fix it! Go find Chandler! He's probably up in your room! Tell him that you're sorry and that you love him.
You know what? I'm not gonna be able to enjoy this.
Well there really wasn't much time to get used to it, you know what I mean?
Oooh! They are in for a world of pain!
Everything is so distorted! Looks like Joey has a giant hand! Which says "Rangers" on it. They went to the game!
Well forget it! It doesn't hurt that baaad!!!!
Y'know what, he's right. There's something like uh, ammonia in that, that like kills the pain.
You bought the beach house when I was 23!
We're sorry honey, but we just assumed if you got married after you turned 30 you'd pay for it yourself.
Here you go, maybe this'll cheer you up.
Oh Chandler, I know, I know... oh, hey! You can see your nipples through this shirt!
Okay. Let us start with the A's. Advertising.
How long was I in there?
No! We only mess around at his place!
Why? Do you another boyfriend in there or something?
I'm Monica Geller. I've been taking care of you.
I'm Phoebe Buffay.
: Yes! Chandler Watches Shark Porn!
Nooooooooo!
Oh, what are we gonna do! I don't wanna see her!!
Oh, I know! "Oh...I slept with Billy Joel". All right, who hasn't?
That place in Vermont? You can take a hint!
Honey, I got us that room at the Woodford Inn this weekend.
You know, it still smells like monkey in there.
Why couldn't you have just figured this out six years ago?
Pete! Pete!! That guy's pretty huge!
And his opponent, from Hunnington Beach, California! He's a 300 pound street fighter, Tank Abbottttttt!!!!
Oh that's great, why don't you tell mommy on me.
Well, Monica keeps changin' the channel.
All right, then show me some manly moves.
Hey-hey, hold on, this isn't some kind of like girly dance. All right, it's like a sport, it's manly!
Then why the hell are you dumping my brother?!?
No! There is.. there is noone else!
That's the nicest anyone has ever said to me!
Yeah. I know it must be important to you when you start chattering like a monkey.
Why are you talking about volcanoes all of the sudden?
Oh yeah, lava spewing, hot ash, of course some are dormant.
Because Armadillos also wandered in the desert?
You are? Me, too!
Chandler, that's like your fourth cup of coffee!
Oh, okay, thanks.
I know what you mean. You're like a sister to me too.
Mon... Okay... I've gotta... just say what it is I'm gonna say... None of the amazing things that have happened to me in the last ten years, would have happened if it wasn't for you. No-one has been more like a sister to me...
Y'know, Joey, I think it's time to give up the bag.
Y'know what? It was a stupid play anyway!
Did he give you that whole "You're-not-up-to-this" thing again?
Ooh, I hate when my father calls me that.
No, I want everything that you just said. I want a marriage.
Sure you do.
Wow, he's really not letting this go, is he?
Thanks.
Chinese menu guy. Forgot the menus.
Hi Monica.
Oh I can't. Dr. Roger is coming over again.
So you uh, want to do something tonight?
Yes I did, I'm Monica, Super Aunt.
Oh my God! You got her to stop crying!
Y'know she has 147,000 pairs of boots...
Oh really? Like what Monica?
Well there's some people who do want to marry me.
Monica face it, Chandler is against marriage. And-and always will be!
Sweetie, we heard you crying. Please don't cry.
Oh God, it says he was hit by an ice cream truck and dragged for nine--teen blocks. Oh. Oh my God.
What are you talking about? We're all together right now.
Alright, okay, so we can all go now. That is fun. Hey, you know what? We all haven't been together the six of us in such a long time.
Un, no you didn't! You must be mistaken!
Yes there are, I just saw them a few minutes ago.
That's not true, there are great pictures of us!
Oooh, I'm afraid that does not exist.
Yes! Why, did you-you forget to make yours?
Do we have to make the entire thing?
Joey! He's working! You would look good in that.
Excuse me?
I love the "I forgot the present" fake out!
Okay! Oh man! Don't tell me I did this!
Not a lot, Phoebe's kidding, Phoebe's crazy.
Hear that? She likes me best, and apparently there've been a lot.
Oh yeah, like I'm going to let you talk to the queen.
I will explain it to her.
The truth is, Dad, we're-we're trying.
Oh, I don't think that. Before today I never thought of you two having sex at all. It was a simpler time.
It just makes more sense as an ensemble.
I'm not wrong! I wish I was. I'm sorry. Bet that barium enema doesn't sound so bad now, huh?
Quick, Phoebe, tell us before he can swallow.
Hey you guys, you will never guess who's coming to New York.
Did you ever, uh, like, think about the future?
Okay.
I told you! I am not coming to a naked wedding!
Awe, this is so sweet of you! But you know what? I won't be needing a veil, I actually won't be wearing a dress at all!
I feel really sad that we're not...really there anymore.
So?
Chandler, do you think we talk about our relationship enough?
Okay, I got a good one. Okay, umm, what is she? Like 12?
Hey, did you guys know, that your oven doesn't work?
All right. Don't look at my list, Ross, 'cause there's a lot on there that you don't have.
Yeah, Chandler... you've been there for five years.
Why? This was supposed to be a temp job!
Yeah. You're just gonna have to stop pissing me off.
Really?
Ross and I always wanted to be Donny and Marie.
Yeah-uh!
Oh yeah, of course. I'm fine it's just that-
Are you all right?
Because Phoebe and Gary are in that-can't-keep-their-hands-off-each-other-doing-it-in-the-park phase!
Ugh, we have already proved that we are hot! Okay? So why-why are you getting so obsessed about this thing?!
Okay! There you go! It's two tickets to Vegas!
Okay.
Y'know what? I-I don't want a big, fancy wedding.
Well, stuff like where'd we live, y'know? Like a small place outside the city, where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff. Y'know, we could have a cat that had a bell on it's collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door. Of course, we'd have an apartment over the garage where Joey could grow old.
Would you let it go? It's not that big a deal.
Ohhh... I'm fine.
Okay. Right. Oh my God that is gonna be so hard.
We don't. Not until it's a hundred percent. I mean, why upset everybody over nothing.
Six? I just had it for one night. It's three.
Six dollars, please.
I know! I'll tell you something, we are gonna do that again!
Oh my God!
Yeah, well you promised Barry, you'd marry him.
Because I promised Mindy I would.
How can I not do it? I have $127 in the bank.
So don't do it.
Yeah! That's why I'm sleeping with him on the side.
So do you think uh, Joey's more charming than me?
I just told Rachel that Roy touched my boob.
He'll be here OK, take a chill pill.
Hold on a second! What is that on her ankle?
Actually, I was kinda hoping it would be the other way around.
So, why don't you just take it back to where you got it?
Baking it didn't help, huh?
Not that bad? Did you hear the hammer story?
It's not that bad.
Y'know, I love doing crossword puzzles with you honey!
Okay.
Oh, just so you know, you-you have to let him win.
Or you can sit with him on the front porch and make sure no one steals the trash cans. He does that every week too.
All right, that's it, we're going to the emergency room.
Ahh, I think it just moved. It's really poking me.
Dad, it is not. What's with the red light?
It is off.
Yeah. Rach, are you thinking you're gonna make it to Vail?
Yeah. Oh, can I come?
No, no. It felt nice to acknowledge this.
Hey Mon? Was it weird changing your name to Geller-Bing?
You don't have a car. And your license expired.
Yeah. It's just gonna be too hard. Y'know? I mean, it's Ross. How can I watch him get married? Y'know it's just, it's for the best, y'know it is, it's... Y'know, plus, somebody's got to stay here with Phoebe! Y'know she's gonna be pretty big by then, and she needs someone to help her tie her shoes; drive her to the hospital in case she goes into labour.
Fine, so you don't like them. Everybody else does.
Did I? Let's refresh. I believe what I said was that I could see your scalp.
They could be our neighbors, what are they like?
Well, we already have one offer on it, and I think the lady upstairs is goning to make another one.
Okay, so you were trying to play bad this whole time.
I played bad on purpose guys.
I promise you, next time I will absolutely tell you.
I love Vegas!
I can't believe her, y'know it's just-it's so typical.
No!
Wow. Oh wow. You know I love you too, right.
Right.
Oh, that is so sweet. Oh gosh, love you. Insurance?
Yeah.
Yeah, I couldn't be mad at him for too long.
Ohh! You made up!
See yeah umm, you kinda stole my thunder!
What?!
Guys, you're a few steps ahead of us.
Sure, if you cared enough to call it first.
Joey, why don't you put them in the lost and found?
Na-uh! Hey did anybody lose their keys?
Look Julio, someone left their book here.
Adios.
You go girl. I can't pull that off can I?
No, see this isn't about the movie theatre, this is about you stealing my wind.
I meant, why don't you take Richard to the game? What?
Glad to be of help. Matches.
Here, let me make the milk, I'm up anyway.
It got interesting! Damn you Oprah!
You broke up with a girl because she was fat?!
I did not say fat! I said, "Fa-aa-aw-ow..."
Guys, please, I'm just gonna have dinner with him. Okay?
Oh my God!
You know, it's a really funny story how this happened.
A piece of something: boxer shorts, greeting cards, and what looks like a half-charred pictureWow, that guy's hairier than the Chief!
Yeah, because I hear the king is looking to adopt.
What if they're not? What if it's adopted by a king?
Oh my God, what would have done if I said yes?
I didn't think I was!
No, I think that this is what you wanna do, I think it's great!
I know, I, I should have talked to you first about it.
Ditch you? Phoebe, you were pregnant with the triplets!
Oh please, you are not gonna ditch again like you did with London.
Oh that's a great idea. You're really good on the phone.
Hey, y'know if you want to pick up some extra cash? Some friends of mine made good money doing telemarketing.
Ohh! Fish, seaweed, a sunken ship.
Really? Which one?
Oh that's too bad. It's true, but too bad.
Somehow they got the idea that you only invited them because of me. They...feel a little unwanted.
Well, it's a set and they should probably stay together.
Is that a problem?
Hey Frannie, welcome back! How was Florida?
Hey, Monica!
Don't get too attached, she's having it cremated.
Oh my God! Oh my God, look at these pelts!
Doing great, the quiches are coming along.
How's the hired help?
No you learn these things. You grow into it.
Yeah but they're right. I mean, I'm not a strong father figure and I never will be.
Y'know, there's a Starbucks about three blocks down.
Electrifying. Emphatic time-time-time...
Oh-oh, no no don't worry, I'm gonna wash it.
Uh-huh. Is it dirty?
Well... of course I thought of you! But... but...
Uh-oh.
Ohh, I'm sorry I couldn't think of anymore for Ross!
Hey!!!
Yeah, we named the boy Jack after dad.
Yeah. It's a shame you two didn't get to spend more time together.
Are, are you okay? I mean, do you want me to stay?
Please, no, go, that'd be fine!
How about we play for more money, say 150?
Well, I'm so confused as to what we've been doing so far...
Oh my God. You're even dumber than I am!
I don't know, I told her it was stupid to put off the wedding just because the hall was gone and she liked flipped out.
It's okay! It's good! It's good. It's a disease!
What?!! No I'm not!!
Rachel, you say you're sorry or your sweater gets it.
No.
And what are you laughing at, Miss `My-keg-sucking-boyfriend-is-stealing-from-me!'
Ohh, that is soo sad.
Look, I am not high maintenance. I am not. Chandler!
I'm out of words. Should I just say the whole thing again?
Was he wearing a stunning blue suit?
Yeah, that sounds about right.
Who's Gladys? Oh! What a tragic loss!
A bunch of stuff. And the worst one... he wants me to get rid of Gladys.
But more importantly to full well-rounded lives.
But also knowing it means a lot.
Oh, they're brochures from different adoption agencies.
Hey, what's all this stuff?
Oh my God Rach. Bean bag chairs.
O-kay. I'll see if I can find Ross.
No! Rachel, you didn't find anyone so you can't tell him.
Yeah, y'know what? I'm-I'm gonna meet you upstairs in a minute.
Why does my cinamon stick have an eraser?
Yeah?
Y'know, maybe it's best that we never got to do it again.
You spend half your life in the bathroom, why don't you ever go out the bloody window!
I can't believe mom and dad are selling the house!
What? What happened to the window in the attic?!
No! You are not gonna run out and leave her here!
I know, I know! What am I going to do? Ooh!
...Oh! I-I see you moved the green ottoman.
Very clean! It looks great! Terrific!
All right! You and me! Let's go! Right now!
Y'know, I know you're talking, but all I hear is, "Blah. Blah. Blah-blah-blah."
I've never loved anybody as much as I love you.
Yes! I love you! I've never loved anybody as much as I love you.
It's some of Richard's hair! What do I do with this?
What?!
I don't know exactly. It's-it's sorta like wrestling.
Why?! What is it?
Chris says they're closing down the bar.
Do I ever.
Ok, then, why are you... all dressed up??
What? Yes, I am!
See, now this is why I keep notepads everywhere.
Yep, that's my audition.
Rachel, it's going to happen. Chandler is gonna move in here.
Well y'know, it's you guys. You-you do this kind of stuff! Y'know? I mean, you-you were gonna get married in Vegas and then you backed out! I guess I'm not upset because I don't see you guys going through with it. I'm sorry.
Y'know they say a watched pot never beeps.
What should I wear, now I'm all nervous.
So are you thinking of starting up something with this guy?
You know honey, there is a thin line between love and hate, and it turns out that line...is a scarf!
No, actually, we're buying the house next door.
Don't, don't!
So, uh, have you ever thought about being there for her?
Then you do. Heh, heh.
'Cause I don't want to encourage this kind of behaviour.
Why not?
They tore it down a few days early.
What? What?
He's in a different room! He's really that loud?
Well, I am drinking lots of cups of coffee because I'm exhausted! Because Joey started snoring!
Alright, you know what? That's it. You've had your chance.
Oh yeah, about telling Mom and Dad, I was thinking about maybe writing a letter.
Oh, my goodness, they've all gotten so big!
Hi, how you doin'?
I gotta tell ya, I think it's okay to be that guy.
Well, I didn't do anything. I didn't want to be the guy who has a problem with his boss slapping his bottom.
Limited seating?! I am just one tiny person!
So I finally heard back from Aunt Sheryl and apparently it wasn't a mistake. Ahh, there's-there's limited seating in the hall.
I don't want her to get a boob job! That's crazy!
Boob job.
Chandler! He's your father; he should be at the wedding.
Oh! Right. Umm, maybe that's because I didn't send him an invitation.
He probably wants you back because you're right for the job.
Oh my God! What if he thinks I'm the kind of girl that-that would just sleep with him?
You don't mind me touching your belly, do you?
I know.
So, we did okay at the strip club, right?
Yeah. Oh, yeah.
I have you scheduled for nudity at 2300 hours.
Is it okay that I want you to wear that head set in bed tonight?
: Im very, very drunk right now.
You are an amazing wife. No really you're amazing you were actually gonna do this for me, I mean where do you find the strength and understanding over something like that.
You are so cute! How did you get to be so cute?
I think it's just y'know that I haven't been with a guy in so long and how sometimes you're looking for something and you just don't even see that it's right there in front of you sipping coffee-Oh no, have I said to much? Well it's just something to think about. I know I will.
C'mon give me five more. Five more.
And we're changing.
I know, how can you not be accross the hall anymore.
I know you're just moving uptown but I'm really gonna miss you.
No, no, don't get it. Let the machine pick up.
Uh, was that good for you?
Ah-ah-ah, now you started this, you will finish it.
Yo!! Spackel boy! Get up!
I don't know. I guess the other people just don't care enough.
How come it's always us left in the field holding the ball?
Wow! Imagine what our kids would look like!
Okay.
Oh my God, what a fun day! That sounds great!
Oh, good, good, you guys are here! Listen, how would like to spend tomorrow taking care of three incredibly cute little puppies?!
I know! Phoebe is gonna love dressing them in these!
Oh, that is so sweet!
BECAUSE OF OUR MEDDLING! Alright?
Yes!
Eh... Heart Disease, Alzheimers, gout?
No...
Sweetie! Edges! Fingers! Smudgey! Pictures!
...I mean it's my fault.
She was like 30, dark hair, attractive.
So uh, what did this woman look like?
The game's over! Take off your robe!
What party?
All right then, your bra would still be big.
What, no, no, no, mine are deceptively small I mean, I-I-I actually sometimes, st-stuff my bra.
Not just the phone pen. I never get my messages.
Okay, good. There you go. Doesn't anyone feel better?
You remember that video I found of mom and dad?
Mon, Mon, are you OK?
Well, no. But, um, I bet she probably does.
You're sure? You're absolutely sure?
Shut up, the camera adds ten pounds.
Some girl ate Monica.
I can't believe they called, and we're actually getting a baby.
I know. Have you considered pageanting?
Oh yeah? Ok, let's settle this, come on!
Why? The only person my playing is bothering is you!
Well, if you want, you can stay with Rachel and me tonight.
My grandmother has this new boyfriend, and they're both kind of insecure in bed. Oh, and deaf. So they're constantly, like, having to reassure each other that they're having a good time. You have no idea how loud they are!
But why?! Did he get in touch with Emily?
He's talking to London!
Rachel! Rachel! You haven't touched Eldad's hair!
No-no-no-no! Have a seat! Have a seat!
Joey, take your time with that. That's my last batch.
Put your hands together.
All right, just trying to start an interesting discussion.
I had a wedding.
Hey, Rach, can you give me a hand with this box?
Yeah, all right. Meanwhile, I'm gonna do whatever I can to help this so, I'm just gonna y'know, lie it your chair, Y'know? Yeah, good, I'm let gravity y'know, do its jobs.
Easy Rach, we'll find it. Won't we!
Oh, like I wasn't dreading tomorrow enough, having to give it back to him... 'Hi Barry! Remember me? I'm the girl in the veil who stomped on your heart in front of your entire family!' Oh God and now I'm gonna have to return the ring, without the ring, which makes it so much harder...
Hey, cheer up! You're gonna see her again, right?
Nah.
We forgot to sign one of the admissions forms.
What?
It's unbelievable! I-I can't believe that sign didn't work!
Thank you.
Uch. I am still so mad at you for smoking.
What?
Where is everybody? They're forty-five minutes late!
Okay.
What? I-I bought groceries, I was gonna make you dinner!
See you later.
Oh, I can't. We're throwing Phoebe a bachelorette party.
Would you guys want to come down tomorrow and watch me tape the show?
All right, I've heard enough. I've made my decision.
I'm not arguing with that.
Well, you-you coulda just turned the cushion over.
That was supposed to be a good thing, I forget why. Just listen, Monica, I, do you know, okay, do you know, I couldn't sleep for like a month because I got like a dot of ink on one of the sofa cushions.
There's nothing we can do. You erased the message!
No, Monica! Monica! We have to fix this!
Rach, I know her pretty well, can I go? That's fine.
I got time.
All right, biggest suite in the place. Come on!
Thank you, Mister Drunken Gambler! Okay, you get this and uh, we get the biggest suite in the place! Wait-wait-wait-wait! We get the biggest suite in the place.
He's seeing someone. I can't believe he's seeing someone.
Now she sounded breezy.
Joey, please come. It would mean so much to us.
But no, it's not close. You said it was in escrow? I couldn't even find it on the map.
Phoebe and Gary are so gonna hear about this at dinner.
That was amazing!
Well, that was weird. You were loud, and I was fast.
This is unbelievable. I - I have never been so insulted in my life. Now, if you'll wrap up my free crab cakes, I'll be on my way.
Oh good! 'Cause where else would we get any?
Thank you. Oh, cool! Free sample of coffee!
Whoa whoa whoa! Where're you goin'?
See ya!
Oh, and you know who's selling a great apartment? Richard!
Real estate, huh? Hmmm...
Chandler, stop! It is not going to pop open!
No need!! Problem solved, we are powering through .
Ross hasn't worked at the museum for a year!
Yeah, well, Hurricane Gloria didn't break the porch swing, Monica did!
No, but he told me, he thinks your a fox.
Does anyone else think David Copperfield is cute?
I have no idea. But look how much they spent!
How could someone get a hold of your credit card number?
Nothing. I just think it's nice when we're all here together.
What's going on?
Hey Phoebe... how you doin'? You feelin' better?
Hi.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, where are we on the hundred bucks?
Ok. Look uhh, Mon I'm, I'm really sorry.
First, I need a boyfriend, then I can have a list.
Hey, Monica, who would yours be?
Oh, so you finally took it out of the marina huh?
Great! I'm finally getting into this sailing stuff.
Yes, but you cannot tell anyone! No one knows!
You?! And-and you?!
All right umm, a string quartet for the procession.
Okay.
Bobby and I are going away for the weekend, remember?
Where ya goin'?
Yeah. And y'know, if you wanna cry, that's okay too.
Yeah, come on! What's going in on in there?
No Mom, I don't have a restaurant, I work in a restaurant.
Oh, she just graduated, and she wants to be something in cooking, or food, or.... I don't know. Anyway, I told her you had a restaurant-
Yeah, you can hear everything through these stupid walls.
Is that Ross?
Ross, we're kind of in the middle of diner here.
Hey, you guys... I have great news.
It sounds like it's coming from across the street.
I think it's the dying cat parade.
Relax, Ross. She's not made of ice cream!
Hey! What's she doing back here?
Yeah, we used to perform for our family and friends.
You guys just keep getting cooler and cooler!
Okay! But you can't rip it. Well, maybe a little.
Oh that's great! Great! Thanks! But that dress I mean it's like yuck! It's terrible! It makes me wanna just rip it right off of you!
I kind of have to don't I? Because of this stupid thing.
Do you have to go?
So? How did it go with Joshua last night?
Hey-whoa, slow down. No, keep moving. Wow!
When you get a sec, another round of daiquiris.
Come on! Look where you are!!
Relax, she-she's gonna give in way before you do!
Okay, listen, how far am I gonna have to go with her?
Okay, here's your milk. What do you want to talk about?
Okay. So, this wire is connected to this wire which plugs into here. Okay so, to get the beeping to stop all I have to do... Well done, Pheebs. What do you want from me?!!!!!!!
Why don't I just take off my clothes and have a nightmare.
Well that's all right, you can come up to the front and dance with me.
I can not see him? I mean, you can't tell me what to do!
There's not gonna be a next time! You can not ever see him again!
You cried yesterday at the six o'clock news.
Oh, you're definately not. I haven't cried like that in years.
Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please?
Well, they don't have to know that...
Wait Chandler come on, let's-it's not a big deal!
Okay, it's just weird! Okay? I don't want to be standing their saying my vows and then having the mental image of you and Monica! I-I-I need...I don't know what I need. I need a walk.
Ok, it's 2100 hours. Time for your toast.
I'll do it!
I know... it's just... I thought this was, you know... it.
Yeah!
It needs to go about 20 blocks to the left!
I'm not moving! Is that picture straight?
Hey, where is this guy, it's been over an hour!
AND ON MY TURF?
That kid really kicked me hard on the plane.
And as my wife I think you should grant me this favor.
To score the winning touchdown, by the way.
It was soo not an accident. She saw I was about to tag her, so she threw her big fat grandma arm elbow right into my face. And just keep running.
No Phoebe, those are like the side affects and stuff.
Oh, I love you Hexadrin! Oh look! It comes with a story!
I can't believe this! This is like the worst night ever!
Thanks.
Now, these are-are more realistic, but perishable.
Thank God!
Oh, Joey, please tell me you're only donating your time.
... It's a fertility study.
This is what happens when you don't register for gifts!
An old cookie?
That's a good idea! Wait, do you know how to waiter?
Hey, Mon! I'm not doing anything, why don't you fire me?
Hey, where are all my ovulation-sticks? There's only one here.
Tough crib.
Yeah, but if it's good news, you should tell him now.
He's right, cause if you're just gonna, like, break his heart, that's the kind of thing that can wait.
Yeah. Umm, Chandler can I talk to you outside for a second?
Hey, you're back too!
No, it's not a sign! It's a very old key!
This is not a sign!
Wow, she must have hurt you pretty bad, huh?
Yeah, that was Leslie calling again to see if we can get back together. That's the twentieth time today! And good luck Leslie!
Alright that's great, then just go. Go Knicks.
Oh, no, honey, I mean, don't worry, I like hanging out with those guys. It's fun for me. They're different than my other friends, they don't start sentences with, 'You know who just died shoveling snow?'
Believe me, that is not why we won't be doing that!
Fine, but if we end up not doing this Maxim thing because of this party...
Thank you. Rachel, can I talk to you outside for a sec?
Rachel! Let me in! Rachel!
One hour? You are such a leaf blower.
Well not when they find out you slept with Jason Hurley an hour after he broke up with Monica.
Hey Hon, could you help me get the plates down?
Rachel please! That is so inappropriate!
I don't know what to say. We shouldn't have lied to you.
Yeah?
Just double checking ...no, no, no... No!
I'm still looking through mine...
Thank you. Come meet my friends. This is uh, Phoebe.
Hi.
How can you not remember? You made us call you...Bea.
Okay, you are totally making this up.
Ok, Mr. Heckles, we'll try to keep it down.
I could have birds.
Oh really? Okay, let's compare, shall we.
Oh, Monica, c'mon, you do cool things.
Listen Rachel, I feel really bad about-What are you doing?
I know, I took it hard too.
Do you think they recognize each other from in there?
I'm not getting you a muffin!
Well, sure, what with it being her funeral and all.
Your grandmother would have hated this.
Ok, hypothetically, why won't I be married when I'm 40?
Oh, no, no. I just meant hypothetically.
Honey, the question is...do you really want to marry Joey?
Yeah, I mean whatever.
Oh. Well then way to go you big movie star!
Oh no, I'll be done by then.
I'm also thinking about opening up my own restaurant.
Eh, he said, thank you very much, he thinks you look very pretty tonight, your hair, golden like the sun. So you're a chef?
Oh she misunderstood, she thought she was moving to Tulsa.
What is wrong with Emma?
He's not gonna say anything, because we're not gonna tell him.
Okay. Okay honey, he's fine, he's fine, let's just put him down. Come here, Ben. See that's a good boy. How could you do that to him!! Ross trusted me, what is he going to say?!
Uh, Chandler did! What does he want you to give up?
Oh, it's so hard to get rid of stuff! Did you and Chandler have to make compromises when you first moved in together?
Uh, Aunt Iris? This is Phoebe, and that's Rachel...
Girls, sit down.
Ah, well then there are gonna be a few surprises!
I don't have a fax machine.
No! Steady as a rock! Now, are you with me.
Why? Do you have the answers written on there?
I'm quitting!! Woo-hoo! I'm okay!! I'm all right!!
Yeah, sure. Good luck!
No honey, I'm sorry, but the weekend's not over yet.
Did he call? Did Mark call?
Wow! Your lip went bald. Hey, thanks.
Hi!
Oh my God! My God! We've got the house !?
I just didn't want to tell you in front of them.
Oh Joey, Melanie called, said she's gonna be late.
Ewww!
Who did we fight in World War I?
You're gonna be late! Go! Go!
Oh! Enough! A monkey could have made 'em!
The cranberries...?
Okay, Joey's gonna catch it, and you and I are gonna block.
Yeah.
Where are you guys going? Come on, one more game!
Shut-out!!
I can't believe you're gonna have sex on my engagement night!!
Oh wow. That-y'know what? That is so unfair. Y'know what? Now I want to steal your thunder! Come on Ross, let's go have sex!
'....Won't you, won't you, won't you.... '
Okay, that's, that's enough.
Hey-hey, how goes the dancing? Gay yet?
Yeah!
Close? She's got her tongue in his ear.
Come on, they're close.
I got offered the head chef job at Allesandro's.
Yeah! What are you saying?
Oh that's right, that's what I'd sound like if I exploded.
Monica bang!
Do not start without me. Do not start without me.
Oh.
Hey, guys. I'm here to pick out my Christmas tree.
Pheebs, you gotta stop this, I working on commission here.
No, he's picking up dinner, why, what's up?
Hey, is uhm... is Chandler here?
Phoebe why don't you just call her? You obviously want to.
It's just y'know, been a couple of hours, and she hasn't called. Not that I even care, y'know.
This is amazing. I mean, how, how did this happen?
And the chicken pooped in her lap. Oh, I'm so sorry. I just gave away the ending, didn't I? Oh! It's just, I just heard this story in the cab, and it is all I can think about.
So maybe they could umm, call the award the Monica?
Oh, it would be you! You! Monica! And you'd get all the votes!
Hi! Hey, Pete you're back! Hey, check this out.
Hi!
Chandler! You don't have to ask for my permission. You can go.
All right, great, road trip baby! This okay with you?
Okay, count to three. 1. 2. 3!
Sorry! Sorry.
Pheebs, spit that out, that has pork in it.
Thank you.
Ok, there's enthusiastic and there's just plain gay!!
So what do you think? I want that guys genes for my kid! Those eyes, those cheeckbones!
Count in our heads as-as good Madlibs.
Count for what?
Are you gonna break up with me if I get fat again?
What?
I can't believe it's raining again! Oh, it's so unfair!!!
Look, I took it too far!
Why? It's not like I'm putting little nipples on them.
Oh god. I think I'm gonna be sick.
So is it horrible? Is everybody working really hard?
Ahh, Merry Christmas; I miss you guys!
And I suppose you used a ring designer for that.
Okay, my trainer, Ho Chi, is teaching me a combination of Gee Koon Doe and Brazilian street fighting, I've even had my own octagon training ring designed.
I'd like a scotch on the rocks with a twist.
So the light went out in my refrigerator...
What are you doing?! Chandler! You can't just go back a phase!
Y'know, I knew something like this was going to happen.
Hi, I am Monica and this is Chandler. Please come in.
Hi, I am Laura, I am here for your adoption interview.
Joey! Why is Janine not coming over for dinner?!
Uh, y'know, starve a fever, go to a play for a cold.
You don't have to stick up for her. She can't here you.
Come on, I think this is a good thing. I don't think Mom would've hired you if she didn't think you were good at what you do.
Wow! So, now you're going on a date with this girl?
Ah-ha!
You're from Yonkers! Your last name is Buffo-Martisis!
Hello Monica. It's Amanda calling again. I am in the neighborhood hoping I can pop by your flat!
Don't worry. You'll find some place to get married.
Man, you are Westminster Crabby.
You bet your ass, I'm gonna fire you! Thank you.
Oh, what are you gonna do? You're gonna fire me?
Wow! I Had no idea you had this much pride.
Because we don't do that. We are Bings! And if there's one thing my father taught me was... well to always knock before going into the pool house... but the other thing was never borrow money.
Why would someone do that?! ...One might wonder.
Okay, uh, you let me go grocery shopping, and I buy laundry detergent, but it's not the one with the easy-pour spout.
Well, we-we had to go back because I forget my jacket.
Hey, what took you guys so long? Your cab left when ours did!
That's sounds great, but how are you going to afford it?
Ooh-Ooh! I did it! I did it! I figured out a way to make money! I'm gonna open up my own massage place and Frank's gonna help me! And! We can work it around his schedule so he doesn't have to quit school!
My dad told me. They play golf together.
Oh, and you know whose knowledge of her ex-boyfriend is shocking? Monica!
No it's not! You want it, you're gonna have to win it!
That cup is mine!
Oh God, oh God, I am sorry... I am so sorry...
Well, ever-ev-... ever since she left me, um, I haven't been able to, uh, perform. ...Sexually.
Awww, y'know what your nickname is, Mr. Big...
Laundry. Huh. Is that my new nickname?
And about an hour ago, we made an offer.
What?
Can I ask you just a little question, huh? Why tonight?
Okay, Monica. Mon, uh what-what you just saw...
Nobody wants to do it? All right, I'll do it myself.
I said I'll do it!
Okay, Joey's doing the ceremony and Chandler's giving you away.
Okay, Mike and Joey, get in position. Chandler, come with me.
We're really sorry, but um, she did ask us first.
So, for the whole weekend?
Is he doing his shark attack bit yet?
That's right Ross, I can see you in your new apartment! And you can see me! Same as yesterday, same as the day before.
All right, half the people. I mean, just try it and see.
What??
Calling Dr. Big, Dr. Big to the bed.
Oh what is it honey, you need some tea? Some soup? Oh-ohhhh!
Well, I love it. I only hope my wedding looks this good.
I know, it's horrible isn't it?
It's Chandler's way of pretending he didn't take mime.
What's a Movement class?
Hey, Rach, you're leaving tomorrow, shouldn't you be packing?
Oh, that sounds good!
You're-you're-you're gonna bring the Barca Lounger over here?
Yeah, I mean we're gonna have to move around some furniture to make room for my chair.
A small puff of air, now come on!
What?!
Wait a minute, they're making you take time off work?
Uh-huh. Well, when the psychiatrist told me I had to take a leave of absence because I yelled at my boss I started to get worked up again, so he offered me a tranquilizer. And I thought was a good idea so, I took it.
If you really want to watch that Serengetti thing, you can.
What?
Come on, was it somebody maybe you dated in college?
Well, is there any chance you were looking into a bright, shiny thing called a mirror?
No, but that's probably 'cause I haven't asked them yet.
Emotional hell. So, did they lend you the money yet?
That could be a four or a five. It's your call.
Here it is! Here it is!
But it didn't. Say hello to Mrs. Chatracus.
No. It disappears back there behind that baseboard. For a minute there, I thought it went downstairs.
Oh my God, oh my God. Call me on the phone!
I want to talk to you about your review.
Hey, we could have used that kind of thinkin' earlier.
Really, hey, you mind if I turn the heat down?
Do you guys know what happened to Chandler's barca lounger?
Hey!
Oh my God, this man is gonna get naked in my apartment!
How old is your phonebook?
Yeah. We-we had sex and then we fell asleep.
Do you know what just happened?
Ross, is he gonna live with you, like, in your apartment?
Hey, that monkey's got a Ross on its ass!
Uhm the... the ministry... of names... bureau...
Where did you go to do it?
So you're gonna be gone four days a week? No.
It's great! How? Chandler. Well my boss and I worked out a deal where I only have to be in Tulsa four days a week, so the other three I can be here with you.
Why are you reading this? You hate this kind of stuff.
There's no back to this couch!
Oh, god... She's told you that already, didn't she?!
But either way... You're gonna get married, you're gonna be happy, my mom's gonna like you better than me.
I'll pick you up at eleven. So glad you're coming.
Okay!
Okay, I-I d'know, you-you just- you have a quality.
WHAT IS IT?!
Hey dad, what's up? Oh God. Ross, it's Nana.
Monica, your dad just beeped in, but can you make it quick? Talking to Rome. I'm talking to Rome.
Dad, dad. We got it!! We Got It!!!
Ohh, I thought that you....
This is it. Yeah, this is the one. I can't believe I found it!
Thank you Rachel but, look at Monica!
Oh, when you get over this breakup we need to go shopping.
Those are my shoes.
So, how about you huh? How do you know the happy couple?
Stop saying, "Blood" to strangers.
Outgoing! Did that say outgoing?! Not, outgoing!!!
Your outgoing message has now been changed.
Ok, thanks for coming, I hope you guys had fun.
I, I know.
Well, I want he baby to come out all cute and fat!
What? She's gonna eat all those cookies?
Please. Half the guys out there have makeup on.
But, won't she notice I have makeup on?
Why do you guys have so many keys in there anyway?
Hey, I got one keyhole and about a zillion keys. You do the math.
Well that's the best part. Umm, you guys get to decide!
Yeah, I'll do that. So who gets to be yours?
Oh my God, I love how thin these walls are!
Wow!
I... I'm sorry, who should be along in a what now?
Well, you don't have that much time to relax. The other one will be along in a minute.
Oh, of course, it's so nice to see you again, Zack!
Hey! Look I brought a friend for dinner, this is Zack, from work!
I didn't mean to cut it off. It was an accident.
That's why I lost my toe?! Because I called you fat?!
Man, I knew it! I knew you were going to do this!!
I'm just hanging out. Y'know, having fun. Y'know with the girl that I'm seeing casually.
The waiter carried the breadsticks in his pants!
Well our service is not grossly incompetent.
All right. When is, when is the next flight out?
No, because she hasn't come home yet. And she hasn't been home all night! She's obviously staying with that other guy, and I'm the stupid moron who spent the whole night outside her apartment!
That's not even a word! I can get this! I can get this!
Oh-oh-oh, he's a transponce-transpondster!
Oh, can I borrow this? My milk's gone bad.
Hey.
Are you sure he didn't break it because it really hurts.
Stop the bus! Wait! Wait! Wait!
Now come on. Well, I'm glad we worked things out.
Great.
Even if I shrink down to two inches tall?
So you can balloon up or you can shrink down and I will still love you.
Oh, wow, can you believe you're like three weeks away?
At what point did it stop being funny that I took her passport? OPENING SEQUENCE.
You've been lying to me? I can't believe you'd do that.
I'm sorry but, ow-owww-owww!
I can't just walk away! I've put in four hours!
Monica, that was also true an hour ago! I mean, please, look at you! Your hand is blistered, you can barely stand, your hair is inexplicable! Ok, you've already proven you are just as good as he is, now we've missed our dinner reservations, so now let's just go upstairs, order room service, take a shower and shave your head!
I tried to reach you at work. There's....been a fire.
Hey!
I know! Hey, you haven't been practising the routine, have you?
Can you believe this? We're gonna be on the platform for the Millennium moment!
Well if-if that's what it is, then it's-it's crazy.
Yes, but this is Pete. Okay? He's not like other people, on your first date he took you to Rome. For most guys that's like a third or fourth date kinda thing.
He would just roll me over and I would stop snoring.
Ohhh, yeah!
Oh God... Why don't they put chairs back here?!
Well yeah, I'm sorry. I know this is the wrong time and the wrong place but I had to tell ya! I wanna spend my life with you. I wanna marry you. I wanna have kids with you.
Well, I'd like to but, I'm not sure we have time to go.
Look, come on you guys, you said you were gonna try! All right look, I came over here to invite you guys to a movie with me and Janine.
What kind of social situation are you comfortable with?
This is exactly the kind of social situation that I am not comfortable with!
He's coming. Be cool, be cool, be cool.
Where? Ooh, come to Momma.
Honey, listen... You have nothing to worry about with Geoffrey.
So those were pity laughs? PITY LAUGHS?
Wendy? -- That sounds like a girl's name.
Ah, well no, it's just uh, me and Wendy.
No, I have just to have two more points to beat him!
Ok, look! Enough is enough!
She doesn't have a stomach ache, she's in labor.
Relax! We just get her some antacids.
What happened? You still have the Monica wedding fund don't you?
You tell her Jack, I can't do it.
What's the matter, officer? Has someone been bad?
That's right, it's officer Goodbody.
What?..... What, you wanna spell it out with noodles?
Ever since she walked out on me, I, uh...
Joey, stop hitting on her! It's her wedding day!
And hey, you need anything, you can always come to Joey. Me and Chandler live across the hall. And he's away a lot.
Oh!! You guys knew about this and you didn't tell us?!
Yeah, well, I guess they had a fight, and he got drunk....
'Fraid so. Brown hair, green eyes...
Sounds nice.
No, umm, he met some girl at the coffee house.
Is ah, is Chandler around?
I won't give you anything, but you'll owe me 2.95.
Hey, how much will you give me to eat this whole jar of olives?
Okay, Mike and Joey, get in position. Chandler, come with me.
Na ha ha... Ne he he... Ah ah...
Do you really think marrying someone else is the right answer?
Oh, ok, you want me to marry Mike? Alright, well, let's just gag him and handcuff him and force him down the aisle. I can just see it: "Mike, do you take Phoebe..." You know, it's every girl's dream!
I don't know. Rachel I'm-I'm sorry that I hurt your ankles.
Why? Why would you do that?
C'mon, you can't live off your parents your whole life.
Oh God, come on you guys, is this really necessary? I mean, I can stop charging anytime I want.
Mom! Dad! Ross smoked pot in college!
Wha-what?
Ohh, you are such a good boss! Is she pretty?
I sent them home.
Oh please! Why else would you have made out with Ross?!
Ugh, Monica I don't want to steal your stupid thunder!
Rachel! What is your cat doing in one of my bowls!
All right! Let's go! Let's go Team Monica! All right, we can work out the name later.
Please, it's a relief is what it is, is what it is.
Somebody seems to be missing being the hostess.
Ah no, the other Phoebe, the one you went to go see.
I'm kind, caring, and sweet. What's Monica like?
Ok, thank you. Uh, well this is it. Are you OK?
Please, make yourself comfortable and I will back in a moment with Erica.
Oh, we weren't talking about you. No, no way to recover.
Yeah, hey.
I just told my Mom I'd cater a party for her.
Oh! Good thing Chandler's not here, he always wins at this game.
Phoebe? Oh, Phoebe, I'm so sorry. Have you been here long?
Monica! I'm sorry I'm late! Monica?
Mail call, Rachel Green, bunk seven.
Okay, okay, I checked. We have: Earl Grey, English Breakfast, Cinnamon Stick, Camomile, Mint Medley, Blackberry, and.. oh, wait, there's one more, um.. Lemon Soother. You're not the guy that asked for the tea, are you? Okay.
Dad! There's Ross , why don't you go talk to him?
What?! I've never seen one before!
Do you think breaking up with him was a huge mistake?
Okay, all right, so, your in a meadow, millions of stars in the sky....
Honey, you're just in time, I'm about to sing another song!
I am sorry I am late. You'll understand when you'll see Joey.
Wait a minute, who told you? You are dead meat.
What!
Okay, Rachel, you wanna put the marshmallows in concentric circles.
We will.
Okay, Rachel, you wanna put the marshmellows in concentric circles.
We will.
Ohh! Did you do what I said? Did-did-did you tell her?
They don't really talk to us about that kind of stuff. I can get you some free white out though.
Oh hi! Hi! Y'know, we were just talking about bacon.
Hi.
Joey, what's going on. What didn't you tell us you work here?
Yeah?
What is it? Is there something fundamentally unmarriable about me?
No, no, no.
The ones we had right after you almost threw up.
Which one was that?
Okay, wait, you gotta hang up 'cause we're gonna be late.
Please, stay on the line. Your call is important to us.
I'm sorry, I can't help you. See? Rules are rules.
Hi! I'm sorry, I know it's after hours but I really need candy.
Wait. He pooped in my shoe? Which one?
I don't know. We were watching TV, and then he pooped in Monica's shoe-
Oh please, he didn't hear it! He didn't hear it!!
I want to let her know that there was a cancellation and if she's still interested in having the Bing-Geller wedding at our facility, it is available...
Rach! We weren't gonna miss our friends getting married!
Uh-huh! Ross invited us all to watch.
So, did you play in college? sweatshirt he's wearing.)
Dudes.
Go on, teach me something about men and women.
Oh, I'm so glad we cleared that up. Look, I'm sorry, some things are different for men and for women.
So, why wait 'til Saturday, are you free tomorrow?
Sure. And listen, thanks for doing that for us, by the way.
Well, um, because mainly, um, they don't like you. I'm sorry.
Why wouldn't they be happy?
Look, here's a picture of Scotty Jared naked.
Ok, and I have the, uh receipt for my dinner with Nokululu Oon Ah Ah.
He took up the carpet, and now you can hear everything.
Noo, that's our unbelievably loud upstairs neighbor.
Okay, so how do I make him think I wanna have sex with him?
Then, you will definitely get him back!
What's going on here? You go out with tons of girls.
Eww! Look, I'm asking a favor here. If I do this for her brother, maybe Angela will come back to me.
Phoebe, do you want to go see a movie after dinner tonight?
Yeah, I'm gonna say no.
OK, we got the cole slaw, we got the buns...
Wow, ooh, you're gonna be making money hand over fist!
All right, umm, we're not gonna really keep it this way though.
I think I know that girl.
The big hat, the pearls, the little pick handbag.
What are you talking about?
Oh, actually this year we just made him homemade cookies.
Yeah, we were gonna give fifty, but if you guys gave more, we don't wanna look bad.
Oh my God! Ohh! Look at this one! It's so beautiful!
No, just singing.
Yeah, I changed them. I-I sent you a fax about it!
Oh! I though the pot stickers were supposed to be vegetarian!
Hey Joey, Chandler sold a story to Archie Comics!
Aww, thanks man.
I'm sorry. It's just the idea of being an official Bing.
YOU NEVER DID IT!
Come on guys! Let's go! Come on, it's second down.
Mar-haaaan.
Chandler, we said we would meet at the coffeehouse at six.
Oh! Whoops! I'm sorry, you were talking about Emily!
Why?! Why? Why, why would anybody do something like that?
Of course it was a line!
Can we have our drinks please?! Waiter-Uh, tress!
Oh look, a standing ovation already! So early in the show. Oh turn around honey; let me see your pretty face.
You just put an empty carton back in the fridge!
What?
Yes smokie, that is what it was. I just can't get enough.
Oh yeah, that's what she says. But maybe you're not ovulating at all, maybe it's just a clever ruse to get me into bed.
Is all this about you not being able to grow a moustache?
Because that's who I am, okay? I'm sure a mature man like Richard could see a tape like that and it wouldn't bother him. Just'd be another saucy anecdote for him to share at his men's club over brandy and moustaches.
If it is a new message, what is he calling to say?
Monica, Monica, you know what gets out hummus.
I can't believe it! That there is no money for my wedding?!
Clearly I did not start drinking enough at the start of the meal.
Oh my God! Well push it in! Push it in!
So we're okay, we're okay, we're okay, aren't we? No, we're not okay, we're not okay, there's a bump, there's a bump.
Hey, I made $17 before breakfast, what have you done?
Yeah, you missed, 'Takes money to make money,' and uh, 'Don't make me come down there and kick your wall street butt.'
Oh my God, you can't even see where the Titanic hit it.
Monica! Look! Hi! What do ya think?
Oh yeah that's what you want - my inhibitions lowered.
Hey, that's why I didn't invite you. you have to calm down, alright... go, go get yourself a drink or something...
Woah, woah, woah, let's go back to 29.
Ok, ok, ok, moving on, moving on, next question. Ok number 29, have you ever betrayed another goddess for a lightning bearer? Ok, number 30.
Ooh, what'cha gonna do, fat boy, huh? What?
OK, I don't, I don't mind the last pound. OK, in fact I kind of like the last pound. OK, so don't make me do anything that I'll regret.
Y'know dad, Chandler is one of Ross's very best friends!
I dunno. Y'know to me he'll always be "Jack Geller, walks in while you're changing."
Hmm, well you're around me all the time and you don't flirt.
Well, that's gonna be tough Mon. I mean it's hard for me to be around an attractive woman and not flirt.
He is so cute. So, where did you guys grow up?
Uh, that, that, that would be a judgment call.
Hey, guys, what-what should I wear to a Knicks game?
I don't know! How are the-the-the-the, y'know-You're clothes aren't funny.
I can't believe he has a new roommate. Who is this guy?
Yeah, yeah he is.
Now, are you glad we didn't start with the bikini strips?
Ow-ow-ow-ow! Oh my God!!!
See, didn't I tell you?! You're getting over Ross already!
Well, y'know, a little of this, a little of that. Got myself a date tomorrow night.
Well that is great. And seriously, she seems very nice.
Well, actually it's been great. She's 20 so she's not looking for anything too serious, which is perfect for me right now.
Well, I was going for wrong, but we can use your word.
A bitch?
Okay, so from now on we have to call you Princess Consuela?
Uh-huh!
I wish I could say the same. I'm a little shook up!
Oh, and I promise, I will not fake it this time.
Joey, you're this guy's teacher. I mean how could you do this?
You totally screwed him over.
Hard 8?! We should call it easy 8!
Another hard 8.
Hi. Alan, this is everybody. Everybody, this is Alan.
Okay, please be good, please. Just remember how much you all like me.
You were staring about eight inches south of there.
I was not staring at her. Okay? I was just listening intently. It's called being a good conversationalist. Watch. Say something.
I need more swordfish. Can you get me some more swordfish?
Ross? Ross! Wake up! Ross! Ross! Ross!! Ross!!! Ross!!!!
Wow, being dumped by you obviously agrees with her.
My god, Angela.
I'll bet he's totally over me, I'll bet he's fine.
All right, there are no questions in the happy place. Okay, just, the warm breeze, and the moonlight flowing through the trees....
Live together? There have been no signs for that.
Okay. What if we lived together and you understand what I'm saying?
There are no jobs. There are no jobs for me.
Games and stuff.
Oh my god, little Stevie Fisher? How've you been?
You used to be my babysitter.
Ooh, umm, oh Kathy! Kathy, I love you! Oh!
All right.
I don't care. Oh my god. I've lost the will to scold.
Actually its not pies, its just pie.
: yeah he has to stay in Tulsa this weekend.
Alright thanks, Oh hey have you talked to Chandler?
Those cute little black ones I wear all the time.
Which one?
Chandler, look I-I know that your dad embarrassed you. I know...
Look forget it okay? I don't want to go. I don't want to see him. I don't wanna.
Wow! It took you all night to come up with that plan?!
We... We are not... ...going to let it... be a problem.
Well, y'know it's none of my business, but aren't you married?
Ohh! And I'm one of them!! Wow! Oh, I just cannot believe this! I mean, Joey Tribbiani!
You can also find him under umm, dog and dead.
Ohh, it's me and La Poo! Wow! I miss that dog.
Did it ever occur to you that I might just be that stupid?
Oh, so you just sort of happened to leave it in here?
So it looks like it's going really well for you two, huh?
Nope.
Oh my God! He just said my name! Did you hear that?
Monica.
Well, we don't really have to decide anything right now, do we?
Yeah, it sure does.
Thanks, I'm set. Do you still live with your parents?
Oh, like I'd give up that job! Free popcorn and candy, anytime I want. I can get you free posters for your room.
Really! That long?! Look all you want, it's happening!
So, if I wanna have my kid when I'm 35, I don't have to get pregnant until I'm 34. Which gives Prada four years to start making maternity clothes! Oh wait, but I do want to be married for a year before I get pregnant...
Hi, welcome home. I need to borrow a hundred bucks.
What?
I can't believe you tried to cut me out. Why Phoebe, why?
Well, aren't you a treat.
Well, it's done about two minutes before it looks like that.
Wow, Monica, I love that, you really have faith in me. Thank you. Technical question, how do you know when uh, the butter's done?
So Phoebe, why are there men's shoes by the door.
You know, it's a lot less surprising to do that after I've buzzed you into the building.
Huh? What'd ya say Joe? I'll be right there.
That's so sweet. I'm gonna get some coffee.
Well, that's okay dad, we-we can wait until later.
Oh my God! This is so exciting! Well, get back in there! I'll guard the door!
Oh, I wish I didn't have to wait to take a pregnancy test.
I think we may have really done it this time.
Hey, I have all the space I need. Just do what I did.
Stop it! I will kill you. I hate the fact that my room is so small.
So I, I told Rachel it was just gonna be the two of us.
Hi.
Upstairs in the bathroom right before you felt up mom.
When did I say that?
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I-I should probably leave you girls alone.
All right? What's going on?
That's a great idea! I was saving them for something special.
Hey, why don't you wear those earrings I gave you?
Of course we will, come on we gotta make dinner.
Come on you guys, come on please-please just give her another chance, huh? She'll come around I promise.
Joey is gonna be a celebrity guest on a game show!
Sure.
Because he'll know what to do? Oh my God, you're a genius!
Oh, oh, oh, I'll get 'Rainy Day Bear'!!
All right, sweetie that's fine. You didn't do it on purpose.
I will replace it, I promise. I feel so terrible.
What do I smell? I smell smoke. Huh-did you smoke?
Alright, the truth is, I soiled myself during some turbulences.
Alright, I'm gonna go pick up a few things for the trip.
Yeah, that's the same as "it has something to do with wind".
That is an excellent excellent question. That is excellent.
And sorta just put the receipt back in your pocket?
In that cute, little, sweet way she just did?
She keeps punching me.
Yeah? What does she think of your little science project?
I don't know, she's, uh.... she's pretty great.
Joey, she was listing the countries she's done it in.
Yeah, sure. Well y'know, earlier she was talking about geography.
Don't worry, after a while he'll tune it out.
Oh, DAMN IT!
You have got to get over this. You're not gonna end up alone.
If I'm gonna be an old, lonely man, I'm gonna need a thing, you know, a hook, like that guy on the subway who eats his own face. So I figure I'll be Crazy Man with a Snake, yknow. Crazy Snake Man. And I'll get more snakes, call them my babies, kids will walk past my place, they will run. "Run away from Crazy Snake Man," they'll shout!
Wait, we're supposed to organize the wrapping paper drawer.
Yes, God forbid we throw out old underwear. You-you know what? I'm going to go over to Joey's.
Look look! He's doing it again, the guy with the telescope!
Oh, uh.. I want her to think I might be in a restaurant.. y'know? I might have some kind of life, like I haven't been sitting around here honing for the past few hours.
You guys, Joey just saw Janice kissing her ex-husband.
No, no he's not.
Okay if Mike were here what would the two of you be doing?
God, I wish Mike were here.
So I wouldn't need any, right? Cause I have a straight.
OK, so now we draw cards.
Okay, have you considered using a girl with huge knockers?
Well, first of all, they're not called "sneakers" anymore. Apparently, they're called "kicks" or "skids" and I think I heard somebody say "slorps". And here, look: they've got these wheels to pop out from the bottom so you can roll around 'cause, apparently, walking is too much exercise. Kids, kids, roll your way to childhood obesity! Would you help me try to sell these?
You just wanna stay home so you can make a move on Joey!
When you're sick, you do whatever you can to make yourself feel better!
I hope you're not full, 'cause dinner's almost ready.
That yeti is one smooth talker.
Ha ha, a joke that's funny in all countries.
We know how expensive weddings can be, besides this may be the only wedding we get to throw .
I'm gonna go to the bathroom, maybe I'll see you there in a bit?
Yeah, it kinda makes that-that one night special. Y'know, technically we still are over international waters.
Uh- Rachel has left the building, can you call back?
They wanna know if I'm okay. Okay.. they wanna know if I'm okay, okay, let's see. Well, let's see, the FICA guys took all my money, everyone I know is either getting married, or getting promoted, or getting pregnant, and I'm getting coffee! And it's not even for me! So if that sounds like I'm okay, okay, then you can tell them I'm okay, okay?
Why don't you just be straight with her? Tell her the truth.
Yeah, yeah and you know what, I know she's gonna wanna run again, I just don't know how to get out of it, I mean, I live with her.
Well, you used to dress up in Mom's clothes all the time.
What?
Oh god, waddawe do, waddawe do, waddawe do?
It's the woman from the hospital admissions office. She says there's a problem with the form. Oh, god, oh god...
Okay, well, why don't we all meet upstairs in an hour?
Which, is the new plan!
And make sure our room isn't next to theirs .
Oh! David, get one for us too! Oh, oh, and see if they have a heart-shaped one! And with mirrors on the ceiling!
Oh, that's there on the bottom, see the manager, Chandler Bing.
And if I want to call for a reference on your last job?
Alright, I've got a leg, three breasts and a wing.
Ya know, one of these times you're gonna really be naked and we're not gonna come over.
Yeah, we all have jobs. See, that's how we buy stuff.
So, like, you guys all have jobs?
Ohhh, oh my God! Oh my God! She knows about us!
Okay, so now do you believe that she's attracted to me?
Well, he's my parents' best friend, he has to be there.
Oooh, Rich is goin' to the party too, huh?
Congratulations! Wow! I can't believe you're nominated for an Emmy!
Good for you!
Yeah... yeah, I think there is. -What were you gonna say?
Isn't there?
Did you ever go out with a guy your friends all really like?
Ohh-ho-hooohhh. The hair comes out, and the gloves come on.
It's not Richard! Okay? It's this new guy and he's really good.
Okay, so Richard, Richard!
If only there were a smaller one to clean this one!
Oh, look at her, so happy!
Wait wait! I can't sing in front of all these people.
All right, that was Kenneth with his much too literal rendition of "I touch myself". Coming up next we've got Monicasinging "Delta Dawn".
That didn't work on mom, it's not going to work on us.
Yeah, they print jokes, interviews, hard-hitting journalism. It's not just about the pictures.
Ross, we haven't done the routine since middle school.
The routine!
I'll take it down to 95% but that's the best I can do.
Oh yes, sir! Put me out of my misery. Are you sure you never played pro? Please let them win!
No, wait, please don't go! I've got porn for you too!
Well, I hate to eat and run, but...
Oh my God, I went to high school with her. Rachel! Hi!
And now I've picked it up again.
No it's not, b'cause she's still in love with Mike!
Phoebe is going to say "yes"? That's, that's great!
No, you can't! Friends hooking up is a bad idea.
I just wanted to let you know I've changed my mind: I'm gonna do it, I'm gonna kiss Joey.
I just thought it would be nice if I could have just this one night!
All right, easy mimey, the moment has passed, it ain't gonna happen!
Okay, you can not tell Chandler. Okay? That I ran into Richard.
It's okay. What the hell took you so long?
I'll meet somone else. There'll be other Alans.
I just can't believe this! I mean, with the holidays coming up- I wanted him to meet my family-
No, no, no, no, no, no pressure, no pressure!
Because, I feel like I wouldn't just be going out with him. I would be going out with all of you. Oh, and there would just be all this pressure, and I don't wanna...
No, nononono.. it's just.. things change. People change.
Is there somebody else?
I arranged some pillows on the bed to look like a guy.
What is he doing?
He's not boring! He's just-he's just low key.
So Monica, still going out with Dr. Boring huh?
William Sonoma, fall catalog, Page 27.
Oh that was yours? Uh, yeah, we used it when the duck was throwing up caterpillars.
Does Ralph mumble when you're not paying attention?
I don't know, something either trees or disease-Ralph mumbles a lot.
Oh, not at all. I have no morals and I need the cash.
Hi, thanks for coming in again.
Wow! For just a week you guys are really close, huh?
Oh I just miss him so much!
I know, but what are we gonna do? She really needs this job.
Well, Rachel moving to another country? Not being able to see her every day. How can I be okay with this?
How would that go? Well, it didn't rhyme, but I liked it.
I can write an epic poem about this lip.
Thanks, that would be great. Hey, honey, wouldn't that be great?
Well, if you're having a hard time, you should talk to my friends, Bill and Colleen. They adopted a kid. I'm sure they'd help you.
Wait a minute, she isn't... She's not the one who you...
She's actually very sweet and we used to be very close.
Oh yeah, well there's the possibility that I won't make rent.
So, do you have any other possibilities?
Spend more time with the tie. That'll make a baby.
Finally you guys made it. Pheebs, who the hell-uhuhh!
Why don't you come over tonight? And I'll make you favorite dinner.
Yes! Exactly! And that's why...
Twenty bucks says they're married within the month.
Oh, ha, I wrote that in one minute.
Ohmygod! Rat baby! Rat baby! Rat baby!
Oh, uh, well, I haven't seem it but if I do I'll let you know.
I'm Monica Gellar. Who do you know the bride and groom?
Hi!
Well, if it annoys you so much, then why do you do it?
Oh, those places! There's always so many people, their being corralled like cattle, and... you know, there's always some idiot who goes "Mooooo"!
And that's why, I'm not inviting you in for a drink. Bye.
Hey, how much cash do you got in your pocket right now?
Ross married Rachel in Vegas! And got divorced! Again!!!!
Monica and Chandler are living together!
Now? Is it okay if I go out with Chip Matthews?
Umm, when were you gonna tell me that you're going out with Chip Matthews?
There's a pregnant woman in Ohio, and she picked us!
Are you serious?
There's nothing to tell! He's just some guy I work with!

Oh God bless my dad sound proofing the basement!
Wow! Thanks, you guys. That's uh-ohhh, I wanna, I wanna play you another piece! Umm! Uh-oh! I left my uh, helicopter sounds on another disk. I'll be right back! Okay? This is so nice, I'm-I am so...
Because you're on my team! And my team always wins!
How do you know?!
Oh honey, is that 'cause your Mom died around Christmas?
All right y'know what, nevermind! Everyone wants to have a green one! I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to get so emotional, I guess it's just the holidays, it's hard.
Because there are so many terrible sights in this world.
Why not?
You know what this is, this is us getting ready for the prom.
OK, I was wrong, that's what they used to cover Connecticut.
That's right! You lose sucker!! Please still marry me.
That's it?! I gave up my Disneyland story for that?
Are you nuts?! We've got George Stephanopoulos' pizza!
So you guys want me to take this back?
Nope. Going to the Big Apple Circus today.
Yes, yes, it does. Okay, look, the restaurant called, they wanna know if you're gonna be showing up for work?
What are you talking about?! 007 has all those gadgets!
Rachel got Ross the tuxedo that Val Kilmer wore in Batman. Okay Batman is so much cooler than James Bond!
Hey, Rache. You know what we haven't played in a while?
And what? Missed the expression on your face? Janice likes to have her fun.
No, please don't. Please, Joey. She will kill us!
No, no, no.
Wait, what that place, that pub he took us too?
Oh. Ha-ha-ha. All right, anyway...
No. You don't have any of these cute little obsessive things.
Come on.
It's on us, all right, so don't worry. It's our treat.
Why, it's six tickets to Hootie and the Blowfish! The Blowfish!
Okay, great! Bye. So guess who's coming to Thanksgiving dinner?
Okay.
Oh my god, Joey, for all we know this guy could be horribly...
No, but he's...
That does not mean you know us better, I-I want a rematch.
All right! Ten buck! Fork it over! Cough it up! Pay the piper! Gimme it.
Okay, let's do it. Mom and Dad are gonna be so faced!
We got honourable mention in the brother/sister dance category! Look, it's almost fake midnight, do we really have any other choice?
I wanted it for years! I was gonna make cookies for my children.
Dying people say the craziest things.
I'm fine, just a little tired, I'm okay. How's Richard doing?
So, how are you doing?
How could I be asleep knowing that you were in the next room.
Oh Jeez honey, I thought, I thought you were asleep.
Hey, have you figured out a way to tell him you're moving out?
No. When it comes to sweets, he's surprisingly strict.
Okay, let's start with the free messages outside the UN.
I have a date with this diplomat I met while I was giving free massages outside the UN and, I don't know where his country is.
Matt Guire, Mark Lynn, Ben Wire...
Oh Monica come on, y'know I don't sleep with guys on the first date!
Gosh, doesn't it seem like a million years ago?
Yeah, well I went to boarding school with four hundred boys. Any sex I had would've involved a major lifestyle choice.
As a thank you, Rachel and I will kiss for one minute.
Let us keep the apartment and...
This is so cool, maybe this is something you can do every week.
No, I-I thought it would be more fun this way.
He's with Emily at a Bed and Breakfast in Vermont!
Shhh!! Please! What's he saying?
Chandler, we still haven't gotten an RSVP from your dad.
Alimony.
Excuse me, umm, can I talk to you over here for just a second?
Our last ocean view room was unacceptable to you.
Even Mary Tyler Moore would've been better.
What? That's not? Oh my God.
But that's clearly a joke. This could easily be true.
Because I told everyone he slept with dinosaurs.
Chandler, you're an only child, right? You don't have any of this.
All right, you guys, I kinda gotta clean up now.
Nothing, just never seen you in little stretchy pants before.
OK, let's do it. What?
Okay! Okay! We can take a hint! What are you doing here?!
There you go! There you are!
Oh wait! You didn't just sit on my Kit-Kats did you?!!
No-no!! No!!
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You know what, the way you did it was just fine.
Are you remaking the bed?
What are you, animals? It's 4 o'clock in the afternoon!
Okay if Mike were here what would the two of you be doing?
And well, we probably shouldn't see each other anymore. I'm sorry.
What?
I know, after you left the store, I chose different ones.
I'll tell you what, for the rest of our lives, I'll be careful until told otherwise. hey wait a minute this isn't the china we picked out..
Oh, I can't wait for everyone at work to see these... Ow!
Enchante.
Hello? Oh, hi Ross! See? Other people call me!
See? Now, that's why only the little fake men are supposed to do all the kicking.
Can you believe it? I finally get to run my own kitchen!
Oh my God!! You just ruined the thing I was practicing the whole way home, but I'm soo happy!
Well, I guess we've established who's staying here with Monica...
Look Daddy, it's my life. Well maybe I'll just stay here with Monica.
Honey, that's a great idea nailing the boxes to the floor!
Hey!
Who? Who do you know that are friends that just fool around?
Yeah! You know, ever since I had that dream about him, and can't get it out of my head! And what's the big deal, people do it all the time!
Here's Frannie. Hmm, won't she be happy to see me?
Yes, yes it is. It's uh... Every time on the lips! Why?! Why on lips?!
Yeah. Run ten blocks, that'll help the smell.
Look, I know I feel asleep before I could shower and now I don't have time! They're just ten blocks away, if I run, I can make it.
Wow. Then I would definitely not recommend Mrs. Doubtfire.
I thought that movie was so incredibly... boring. I mean, that thing at the end where the kid kills himself because he can't be in the play? What was that?! It's like, kid, wait a year, leave home, do some community theatre. I walked out of there and I thought, 'Now, that's two hours of my life that I'm never getting back.' And that thought scared me more than all the other crap I was afraid to do.
You promised Dr. Weinburg, you'd never use that phrase.
No-no-no, that was all true. This was just in case you pulled a Monica.
Well actually, I-I didn't eat mine. It's still in the bathroom.
You guys! It was bananas, cream, and beef! I-I just cannot believe that you ate that so that I wouldn't feel bad!
What are you doing here? I thought you had to do inventory all day.
What's up?!
By the way, Ross dropped by a box of your stuff.
Oh, great. Although I did sit down where there wasn't a chair.
Alright, great. Thanks a lot. I'm going to tap class.
What are you doing?
I think, that if you really like this guy, you should just trust him.
What are you saying I should do?
No, he'll be fine. It's the other five I'm worried about.
Well, he's a big boy, he'll get over it.
Wow! It's really red! You should go see my eye doctor.
Uhhh, mine too! Yeah.
Run, Marcel, run! Run, Marcel! Are you okay?
Just a small tranquiliser.
... that she was the huge guy that mugged you? Yah.
Hey, uhm, Phoebe didn't by any chance mention that.
Oh Rachel, I know the best coffee house and it's sooo close.
Okay, let me just get a cup of coffee.
Wait a minute! We're talking about someone that I'm going out with?
Loved him! Yeah! He's great!
I'm sorry, I didn't know to look for Chinese food on the floor.
You stepped on my egg roll?
I know, what about Rachel? I mean how are we even gonna ask her?
Guys, do you think we should ask Ross to come along?
I've got a question. Richard made plans again with the guys.
Me too.
Phoebe, they didn't make you pay for those knives, did they?
Pregnant Woman Slays Four?
Hey, guys, guys, did you see my new, china cabinet?!
I would!
Do you want to go to the bathroom, or do you wanna play poker?
Uh... to the bathroom.
Yes you are! That's the only way to explain all this stuff!
No! No! I am not a sex addict!
Phoebe, do you think that your favorite animal says much about you?
Wow! Well, my folks really liked it! So what-what did you guys think? It wasn't that good.
Mr. Bigot. He tells the most racist jokes.
What?!
Yeah, I think that fifth shower actually got the interview off me.
Hey, you feelin' better?
No fair. I don't even have one. How come they get two?
Oh, look, twins. Hi, guys. Oh, cute, cute.
Okay, okay. You two go get the dessert. And I'll let you in.
So bad.
Oh my God! Then-then-then what are we even doing?! What is this?!
Well, never say never but y'know probably uh yeah, never.
Oh, is it that pinball machine with the big bow on it?
No-no, I got the edge. I know it's not exactly ethical but I sent him a little bribe to
Welcome to the real world! It sucks. You're gonna love it!
Y'know, if you listen closely, you can hear a thousand retailers scream.
It's only been a couple of hours, so just give it some time.
Nope, not knocked up yet.
You know what, I think it's cute, you trying to be more like Richard.
Well for starters, you may want to light it and lose the spatula.
Wow! And around the ankles, y'know that is a tough spot.
Oh hey, no, you're not welcome. Okay, look, I hate this! You guys keep embarrassing me! Yesterday, Rachel found your razor in our bathroom and I didn't know what to say, so I said it was mine and-and that I was playing a woman in a play. And one thing led to another and
All right baby, come on! Yes! Yes! I am on fire!
Okay. Well, if that's how you feel about it, fine! None of you get to live with me in my great big hand-shaped mansion! Except uh, you Pheebs. You can live in the thumb.
These tiny, little non-breasts?! Please, it's gotta be Rachel.
Okay, Monica's are the biggest.
Aw, I'm sorry sweetie that she doesn't feel the same way.
I like her so much!
This isn't how it's supposed to go, there can't be another guy.
She doesn't know which one of us she wants, me or this Colin guy.
So, did you come by to watch us win the big bucks?
Oh yeah! The casserole lady.
Phoebe, don't worry about it. I'm sure she wants to live with you.
No! No, she didn't say that. I-I-I think you should talk to Monica now.
Honey, it's not pushy, he gave her his home number.
But, you, you don't want to seem too pushy.
Well, maybe you're right-She made fun of my phone pen!
Well, one of you has to take the first step! And it should be you, because she's the one who's leaving. It's harder for her!
Get in there man! Flirt back, mix it up!
Very funny Ross! Very life-like and funny. Okay. Oh no-no-no, I wasn't waving at you lady. Whoa, maybe I was! Hey, Monica, this totally hot girl in Ross's building is flirting with me.
Ohh, sweetie! Hey, I bet you anything that he's gonna call you again.
Well uh, his answering machine was very understanding. Ugh. I feel blue.
You know how much I love listening to your music, you know, but...
Yeah.
What-what's the matter? Is there, is there something on my dress?
Oh my God!
Forty-two to twenty-one! Like the turkey, Ross is done!
I went really long.
I'm sorry honey, but we're gonna take you shopping. It's gonna be fine.
Oh God, neither!
Okay.. Well, I'm going out with a guy my friends all really like.
No.
If-if-if we ever did what you did a man would never call.
Shhh...I don't know what to do, this is totally unprecedented.
Pretty much. So, what do you, what do you think of the floor?
Oh did you-what did you-did you work for two days straight?
I'm sure everything's fine. Has her water broke yet?
She's not here yet. She's not here. She's having my baby and she's not here.
Wait, you're giving me your Porsche, you're kidding me right?!
I've been thinking about getting rid of it. I was driving it the other day and saw my reflection in a store window. Your mother's right, I do look like an ass.
I eat by myself in the alley because everybody hates me.
It's like that everywhere, Joey! Okay, Mon, back me up here. Where you work the uh, waiters eat with the waiters, right? And the chefs eat with the other chefs, right?
Ok, so you've done some good work! What about your carry-ons?
I know... Honey, seriously, I did it all. The luggage that I'm taking is in the bedroom, this is Emma's Paris stuff, these are the boxes that I'm having shipped, and that's the sandwich that I made for the plane...
Oh, you're welcome for the party. I'm glad you're having a good time.
I still can't believe you invited Gavin. Allright, he is the last person I want to see.
I won't care, because I know you will be feeling it all in here.
No, I mean, come on, seriously think about it, we get married, we're up at the altar and I'm like this.
Alright . I think it's a big mistake but it's your decision.
I could, I could but I don't want to! I want to kiss Joey!
Did you ever feel like sometimes you are just so unbelievably uncoordinated?
I'm totally getting it!
I can't believe you thought I was cheating. You own me an apology.
I guess not.
Hah, no no no no no no no no no no.
Um... unless, unless I use yours.
See now-now you're taking them away from their home.
Oh, that's cool. Then I'll just bring them both over.
All right, I'll do it just this once! But you can't tell anybody!
Maybe, isn't she the woman who lives below you and has sex really loud?
Honey, if you know it through a wall, you know it too well!
And she's... turning on the TV... and watching... Miss Congeniality!
For the sixteenth time, no... I do not think you're obsessive.
C'mon, just tell me, please, please.
Oh wait, Chandler, come here is there anything I can do? Anything?
Yeah, well, sorry doesn't bring back the little piggy that cried all the way home! I hate this stupid day! And everything about it! I'll see you later.
Hey, they don't pay me a penny a word to make friends.
Oh, okay! "Would I go back to Allesandro's? Sure, but I'd have to order two meals, one for me and one for the guy pointing the gun to my head." Wow! You really laid into this place.
Oh, good to see you too. Did you come down here to tell me that?
Well, it was great seeing you the other night.
Oh my God! Ross, are you in England? Was Emily surprised?
Hey.
Maybe she will. Uh! Why couldn't I have been a Reverend?
So, we'll tell the truth and who knows, maybe she'll like us for us.
Two? TWO? How is that possible? I mean, have you seen you?
Two.
I said that you had a nice butt, it's just not a great butt.
Yes!
Okay, what if the person who adopts the other one is horrible?
Why not? We could give each of them half a medallion, and then years later, they'll find each other and be reunited. I mean, that's a great day for everybody.
Or if you want to kiss him, umm, you could use mistletoe.
What? Were you like in the movie, or... Anyway, she takes off her bra under her shirt and pulls it out the sleeve. Very sexy, and classy.
I gotta go to work. Has anybody seen my left boob?
Ross, you are so pathetic. Why can't your son just play with his doll?
You guys are dead, I am so good at lighting rounds.
Thirty seconds, all the questions you can answer.
I knew it!! Y'know, you're not so quiet yourself, missy!
We have got to move!
I know why do you think he was so worried about me getting bigger?
Just when you thought that dude couldn't get any wierder.
Is he really coming? Because I can see right into your apartment!
He's at a dinner party.
We know how tough those parent/teacher conferences can be.
Thanks!
Phoebe, you do seem a little tense. Here, let me help you.
Y'know it's funny, you'd think I'd be angry. I mean, you'd think I'd wanna rip his tiny little head off. Fortunately, I'm past it.
How can you tell? You can only see the back of his head!
I think it's going okay. Looks like he's smiling.
Hey! Where 'ya headin' in those pants? 1982?
Fine!
That's what you've been working on for the past two hours?!
Oh, Danielle! I wasn't expecting the machine... Give me a call when you get a chance. Bye-bye. Oh God!
What?! Are you crazy?! I'm not getting married! I'm not even engaged.
Monica, you should totally put your name down on the list
Who has her own little desk when Roland's not there.
Newly appointed head lunch chef who is also in charge of purchasing--
Yeah, I'd say so. And there's no 'j' in 'engorged'.
Yeah. Thought I'd give it a shot. I'm still on the first chapter. Now, do you think his 'love stick can be liberated from its denim prison'?
That was some hot love you gave me! I'm gonna go get ready.
The one that doesn't.
Is anyone thankful for anything else besides a thong?
Are you aware that you're still talking?
My God! Chandler, we said be 'aloof' not 'a doof'.
....And then I just, you know, threw the bag of barley at her, and ran out of the store.
Well, if you don't have anything to copy, why are you going down there?
Okay listen, just give me anything I can make two of.
It's okay, 'cause y'know what? You don't really need me for the business.
What?
You guys do that? Chandler won't even have sex in our bathroom!
Hey, you know what, I've never had a one-year anniversary before, so no matter where we go, I'm wearing something fancy pants, and... I'm gonna put on my finest jewelry and we're gonna have sex in a public rest room.
Oooh, I wish she could stay here, but Chandler is allergic!
Well, I'm watching it for some friends who went out of town. Wait. Hello, my name is Clunkers. May I please stay with you nice people?
Well thank God you were here! I mean, we have to erase that!
I know!
You go back out there and you seduce her till she cracks!
It's not my first time.
It's wrong. You know what else is wrong? Phoebe picking Rachel.
He took my joke, he took it.
I don't believe you spent my wedding fund on the beach house!
We have it. Only now, we call it the beach house.
On three, 1...2...3! Now my pillow's all wet!
Okay.
I'm gonna go tell Joey that that you're back. I was really worried about you.
Okay.
Well you can't! We're booked solid for the next month!
I'd love to!
Hey, don't mix those up, you could really ruin that lollipop.
Umm, it's a lollipop and a uh, a home pregnancy test.
Welcome home. I've missed you. join me in the bedroom?
Okay, something to cover the smell ... Oven cleaner! Unscented!
Quick, take off your dress, he won't notice the bed.
Knock, knock.
This woman's got my life, I should get to see who she is.
What, what, so that you can dance with the woman that stole your credit card?
Look umm, of all people, you do not want me to tell this story!
Oh, come on Monica, reliving past pain and getting depressed is what Thanksgiving is all about. Y'know, for me anyway. And of course, the Indians.
It's never taken you more than a shower to get over a relationship.
Yeah, I mean it's never taken me a week to get over a relationship.
Stop it. Stop! Okay let's go. We can be strong.
Please don't leave me, I'll be lonely.
No, the one who looked at you once because you got in her way.
The one that always stares at me when I come in?
You are so handsome! I wanna make love to you right here, right now!
How are you feeling?
Oh please! Did you hear that? Little drops of heaven.
It's candy time! My roommate says that they taste like little drops of heaven.
I swear I've seen birds do this on Wild Kingdom.
Oh my God!
Is that the one that speaks English or the one that doesn't?
Uhh, Joey's grandmother is right there.
Yeah, good for you. Y'know you're tough, you lived on the streets.
Well, yeah! But I'm not gonna take anymore crap. Okay? No more Mrs. Nice Bucket!
No kidding, out of towners huh? What did you tell 'em?
Please! I have people coming from out of town today! And, I told them all about your candy!
Are you kidding me?! Is this; is this turning you on?
It's nice.
Ohh... that wouldn't by any chance be... Joey Tribbiani?
Oh, it's nothing. I went on a date with a guy who lived in this building and it didn't end very well.
Tell them I'm a chef in a big New York restaurant!
Oh, that's ok.I'll just try and reschedule. "Hi, this is Chandler Bing. I made a reservation there and I need to change it Oh, what do you mean it's not refundable? Can I just come some other time? Oh, can't you make an exception?"
With that moustache doesn't Chandler remind you of Aunt Sylvia?
We're the guys.
Maybe a Hello Kitty doll, the ability to walk...
Well, I'm gonna go see her. I want to bring her something, what do you think she'll like?
No, you don't want this. I want to have your grandmother's cookie recipe.
What we want honey.
We'll be right there! Can't you just say it starts later?
Don't let him in! I'm supposed to be at a regatta gala.
No-no-no, don't-don't do the accent. You've got to see her again.
Well I, that's the thing, I don't know! I mean, whenever I brought it up with her she said, "This is so fantastic! Why do we have to talk about the future? Let's just enjoy..."
Phoebe, we're getting married, married; not sixth grade married.
Oo! You should have one of us do it!
Well, I know that would make Joey happy, so, I would like that too.
I was just coming over here to apologize for my behavior! I'd really like it if we could be friends.
Yes, I'm sure! Rachel is there something that you want to talk me about?
Wow that's uh, juicy. Umm, y'know what though Mon, I actually do have a lot of work to do so if-if-are you sure there's just not anything else?
That guy stood on your neck until you passed out!
Well I'm not gonna stop until I'm the Ultimate Fighting Champion.
Y'know what? I-I think that umm, I don't feel like going to The Plaza.
Okay, so The Plaza! Okay, we'll get us some Mai Thai's, maybe no more for you though.
'A Woman Undone, by Rachel Karen Green'.
Hey.
Pleased to meet you. So you're coming to Rachel's party tonight?
Pleased to meet you.
Ohh! Ohhhh! Were you sleeping sweetie? I'm sorry. Here.
What? What? What?
Joe... Emus are birds. You raise them for meat.
Uh, yeah... This guy at work got me excited about going in on an emu farm. That'd be kinda cool huh? Pitchin' in on the weekends, helping to plant the emus...
Oh, okay. Alright, it's flight 421. Leaves at 8:40.
That is precious! Listen! I need Rachel's flight information.
All right, were you guys smoking something in the back of our van?
Woooo!!!
Hello? What?! You what?! Hey you listen here missy! Wh-
You're out of Diet Coke.
The fuzzy little mints at the bottom of her purse.
Oh God!
I can't live like this! What are we gonna do? What are we gonna do?
Oh yeah. If you ah, move your hamper, you see what color the tile used to be. Yeah.
It was a project for one of the Home Ec classes.
They had to have that specially made?!
All right, just give it back to me when your done. See you guys.
Whoa, I'm not done.
Bye bye Mike!/Cya mike!/Bye mike!/Bye bye now!
Ok... so... Goodbye.
Joey, please don't do that. I think it's best that we just forget about it.
I'm gonna go down there and teach that guy a lesson.
Besides, if anybody's gonna get free stuff, it's gonna be me.
Unwilling to steal from work, interesting.
Chandler, relax it's not a contest. Certainly not a close one.
This is so sad. I mean, I only have like ten pins.
Right! .. but we "know" what you're wishing for!
I can't tell you what I'm wishing for! Else...you know...won't come true!
You must feel horrible. Hey! The guys have free porn!
Eh, her-her uncle already had planned on doing it. And y'know, we-we said our good-byes this morning, so...
Nobody move! Okay, you look that way; I'll look this way!
It went under the table.
Alright, we don't know that it's him. I mean, it could be the football guy.
Of course I'm awake. Assume from now on that I'm always awake!
You know, if you just wait another... six and a half minutes...
Hey! Sugar-O's!
Well, maybe you could give to somebody else. Ooh, like Ross Geller.
Ohh.
Hello? Hello? Oh! Rachel, it's Paolo calling from Rome.
Oh, oh, a quality, good, because I was worried you guys were gonna be vague about this.
Do you want some shortbread? Eh that's Scottish like you are.
Well, I feel like a snack!
Hey, do you realize that at this time tomorrow we'll be getting married?
Yes, include more people in this.
Oh. So you made her walk the plank? Aye, matie?
She-she wasn't ready for a serious commitment.
Mom, uh, Chandler was just saying how beautiful your sweater is.
Okay, look at him. Look at those strong hands. Oh what I wouldn't give to be that can of condensed milk.
Okay, I've got some Ones, you wanna put them in her panties?
Interesting.
Okay, so what do you, what do you want to do? Let's do something crazy!
Okay-okay, why don't I sit here and you'll both stop it!
Okay! Okay, let's race! First one there wins! Ha-ha!
Yeah!
I love how it crumbles. Now see, your chocolate doesn't do that.
Yeah?
Well, she's not going to find them lying in the grass like that.
Oh, yeah, sure. I mean, like in the case of this young woman, she has lost her clothes, so she rides naked on the horse, she's crying out, 'Where are they, where are they?'
What, Phoebe, did you whip the potatoes? Ross needs lumps!
Ok, all done.
I know that there's no hole there, I just really liked that picture.
No-no-no, no!
Absolutely! It would just be one friend helping out another friend.
Well, if it helps there were only three. So it would just be for tonight, right?
Oh my gosh! Rachel, honey.. are you okay? Where-where's Paolo?
Thank you. C'mon, Marcel, whaddya say you and I do a little mingling? Alright, I'll, uh... catch up with you later.
Oh wow wow wow!! Make room for your friend!
Sit down.
Y'know, I don't like to brag about it, but I give the best massages!
It's your timer.
Rach, that's great! It's so good that you had a good time in Greece!
Oh, Ross, when you make out card; be sure to make it out to, EM-I-LY.
Yeah, apparently they're turning it into some kinda coffee place.
No way!
Umm, if ah, it might be okay if Ross came skiing?
Ask me what?
Dad , Mom . Look! Look who it is it's Chandler!
Hi!
Oh, don't you guys look cute. You guys make such a cute couple.
Hey.
Where were you? We were supposed to meet in the wine cellar?
Yeah.
So do you think that these pictures-Are, are they trying to tell a story?
Oh, I want to look too! . Yikes!
Well, when you first met Barry, you flitted off to Vail.
I don't care! All right, y'know what I'm just upset that I'm getting nowhere with Joshua that-y'know what still, you do not meet someone and go flitting off to Vermont!
All right, I'm gonna go to work. Does anybody have a problem with that?
No! No, the robots just work for them.
Hey guys check it out! My mom sent me the paper!
Potato, Potaato.
Phoebe! Come on I'm serious! I just got to talk to him about all this.
Okay, don't sweat it. Chandler is nowhere around so go ahead get it out of your system. That guy's cute.
How can that be?! Oh wait! Wait! Are you, are you serious?!
We can't find Chandler...-'s vest. We can't find Chandler's vest.
So. Welcome. Is this your first time you're seeing Emma?
Hey you.
I missed you-you ugly, flat faced old freak!
Yeah.
What happened to your rule about never sleeping with sick people?
Oh come on you big faker!
Rach, get the heat. Ross, could you turn the heat down please?
Oh, gosh, it's hot in here.
Okay, does it involve something to do with Pete's computer company?
I, but you're so close! No!
Why don't you just have a seat here? OK... give me the Gummi-bears.
Oh, OK. Oh, sorry.
You know what, Ross? I'm gonna throw in 50 bucks for you.
Well you wouldn't, but we own the paper, we can print whatever we want.
You touch people's eyeballs every day and this feels weird.
Ew, this feels very weird.
Wait, Joey! Joey! That doesn't mean that-that you're in love with me!
Well, okay. You were my girlfriend and we were doing the crossword puzzle. Y'know like you guys were doing last night. So, that's it. I'm in love with Monica and I'll be moving out.
Chandler, please don't think I was trying to pressure you. Phoebe and Rachel...
Right here!
That's Dudley Moore. I said I wanted it like Demi Moore.
Well, he was a he in Arthur, and in Ten.
I don't have anything like that, but let me go see if Rachel does.
Okay. Here's a question you never have to ask. My dad just called and wanted to know if he could borrow one of your pearl necklaces.
I guess you can get back to deciding on what to get me for a present!
Okay.
Ok, we're not having birthday cake, we're having birthday flan.
Ok, here are the birthday candles. Where's the birthday cake?
Oh, honey, can you make sure we get a King size bed!
Come on, I'll show you guys where to check in.
I-I-I wanna thank you all for coming. My family and my friends...
I think it's necessary.
But you should eat them now because they're hot from the oven.
Oh that's all right. I'm still full from your homemade potato chips.
Okay, can we change the topic? Because it's really doing nothing for me.
That's what that was?! 'Cause that other thing? I thought you were on to something, but it did nothing for me.
All right, we'll stay. We can just drive up after the party.
And I mean, you know, you guys... This is a big deal. I mean, how can we have her first birthday party without her aunt and her uncle!
Uh yeah, I-I actually I thought about you a couple months ago.
So Monica let me ask you a question. Y'know, since we broke up do you ever, think about me?
A new pair of shoes for the Chan-Chan man! Yes!
You're right!
Well, what do you think of Mike and Chandler being in a car accident?
Oh! Well, what kind of emergency that gets us both out of here?
: Honey why don't you just let it go and ask her out again.
HEY! I never have an off night ok although sometimes when I'm a little bloated I don't feel very sexy BUT EVEN THEN I'M BETTER THEN MOST!
Nope, she doesn't have to, I found out who the father is.
O-okay. So, is she gonna take the test?
Congratulations, I think youve found the worlds thinnest argument.
Well, you still havent taken down the Christmas lights.
Of course you can look at it! Yeah, I want your opinion too!
Now, do I get to look at this book or is it just for people who are actually involved in the wedding?
Chandler, what are you doing? That thing can put someone's eye out!
Check it out! Check it out! When the babies wake up, they can meet Krog!
I can't believe it! What is it? Is it the rubbing or the smell?
Yes!
Okay, I talked to the guy with the shovel and I found out what happened.
Uh-huh, I see that.
Phoebe, listen. You were with me, and we were shopping all day.
You were saying?
And that's great for you guys, but we want a lawn and a swingset...
What is wrong with raising a kid in the city? I'm doing it, Ross is doing it, Sarah Jessica Parker is doing it!
It's not gonna happen. They're doing it tonight, we can do it tomorrow.
Shall we?
A wuss? Excuse me for living in the real world, okay?
Oh, Monica! Would you stop being such a wuss?
Ok, fine!! I bought 20 extra tickets for me and Chandler.
Well, well, well, look what mommy found!!
Ross this is the only thing left that has a shot at working.
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. We're not 13 anymore.
I'm not crying about that! I'm crying about something that happened at work.
Okay, but now see you're crying!
What about the second minister we meet with? I kinda liked him.
Water it is.
Two in a row! You've got to use your tongues now!
Welcome to America.
Ross, you were right before, it was just a stupid fight about a room.
No, I-I-I'm serious, okay? I mean, think about it. You move in, you start fighting over stupid game rooms, next thing y'know you break up!
Chandler? I was just in our bedroom and I found these on my pillow.
I'm gonna throw this away, but thank you so much for the gesture!
No, it's not bad. It's not bad at all. It's-it's really nice.
Okay, I love you. Is that so bad?
Okay! Okay! Okay! We'll see you in about 3 to 4 hours.
What?!! Stop it! Stop it! Oh my God!
See? They're as different as night and... later that night.
Periodontist.
Hi, um, I'm gonna need a new set of these forms .
Thank you. Thank you. I love you.
What one? You wanted him to invite you to the party and he did it!
Okay. Walked right into that one didn't he?
And I don't know if you've noticed but she's a HOTTY!! HI!
Oh my God, she's great! I mean, we-we have so much in common and she's just cool, and funny...
Yeah. It's my dad's birthday, I decided to give him a stroke.
Oh, is today the day you're gonna tell them about you two?
Chandler come on. We have to hem the new dust ruffle.
Hmm.
The Way You Look Tonight is on here! Dance with me?
Oh, the mixed tape.
Our kids are gonna call her Aunt Janice aren't they?
Well umm, I thought I was going to go back to my apartment but then I just felt I couldn't really be alone tonight. I was wondering if I could maybe stay here with you, just I really feel that I need to be with family.
Wow! And you got a petticure. Your feet are all dressed up.
Oh Pheebs, is that a new ankle bracelet?
Nah, while you're at Ross's if you see any lying around...
Okay, you want me to stop at the ATM?
Put the plates in the boxes!! Put the plates in the boxes!
Bring it on!
So on this road trip, did you guys win any money?
Oh sweet Moses.
Okay, this isn't working. I'm still awake and now I have to pee.
All right, betting and wagering of any kind, are, I'm sure, not permitted in the happy place. Okay. Just-just, you know, the-the lovely waterfalls, and the, the trickling fountains. And the-the calming sounds of the babbling brook....
Yeah, the best you got in high school was Wet Pants Geller.
Phoebe! You're note, amazing! Not only did no one touch my sandwich, but people at work are actually afraid of me. Yeah, a guy called me mental! Mental Geller, yeah, I always wanted a cool nickname like that.
Ross, just forget about it. This guy's got you totally wedged in.
Okay, forward. Forward-Stop! Okay, back-Stop! Okay, forward-Stop! Stop! Stop!
Umm. Well, there's Rachel, and umm, I think that's it. How bout you?
So you still in touch with anyone from high school?
All right, look, nobody's smoking pot around all this food.
God!
Oh my God, this is great! This is so great! . Did you hear that?
Yeah, when I read about you two, I was pretty sure I wanted you, but I just thought we should meet face to face. . I've made my decision. I choose them.
Joey, what are you doing?! It's never gonna happen, she's seeing somebody.
And I ah, borrowed some of your cologne. I hope she likes it.
I'm Monica. I'm disgusting. I stalk guys and keep their underpants.
Unbelievable! I mean you really kept Joey's underwear?! Why? Why would you do that?!
Come on. I know you're not eighteen anymore, but give it a minute.
I - I don't think I can.
Hi. Uh, we'll be right there, we're just trying to decide something.
Monica.
Hey Rach, maybe your resolution should be to umm, gossip less.
Op, look! Claire forgot her glasses! And she's gonna be really needing these to keep an eye on that boyfriend, who, I hear, needs to keep his stapler in his desk drawer, if you know what I'm talking about.
Relax! You'll be fine. Oh much better. You're invisible now.
He's coming into the audience. He's coming into the audience.
So! Dinner in the kitchen around four! I'll see you then.
Why haven't you told them?! Wouldn't they be happy?!
Hey Joey! Aww, you remembered even though you're a big star!
Hey Monica, it's Joey!
Finger cramp. Oh God, sorry. Here, let me get that mom.
Oh. Speaking of whom, I hear he's got some 20-year-old twinkie in the city.
If that falls off the truck, it wouldn't be the worst thing.
Okay, please be careful with that. It was my grandmother's. Be careful.
Oh, maybe he was getting him confused with his childhood therapist.
Oh, great! Well, then I'm gonna take Emma to see him. I wonder why Ross said that he died.
No it's not. We had an inspection and they didn't find anything.
Fungus! Yeah. Place is full of it.
Okay, please be good, please. Just remember how much you all like me.
Chandler! He's here!
Yeah. I'm okay. I'm actually-I'm a little cold, can I have your jacket?
Yes! Yes! I'm good! Are you good? Are you good? Is everything-are you-are you perrr-perfect?!
I'm fine-d. I'm fine-d! Y'know, it's a really hard word to say.
When you put a 'D' at the end of 'Fine' you're not fine.
Oh, well sure. This gotta be so hard. I'll do it. Gimme!
We have to bust it open, but neither of us can do it!
Ross, I think we should stick to the routine, we don't wanna look stupid!
Hey, when the music starts up again, I was thinking of maybe goind into the robot, y'know?
What are you serious? You wanna marry him? Wha... What about Mike?
Wow? Really? That's fantastic!
You're gonna like him so much. So umm, when do you want to meet him?
Oh...
Ahhh, hey honey? Don't you have to be at your interview now?
I needed to buy a hammer the other night, and I'm out walkin' around the neighborhood but apparently there are no hardware stores open past midnight in the Village.
Don't joke with me, okay? I'm very, very upset right now.
You know, I flew a long way t see my loving wife? Is she here by the way?
Chandler, nobody likes breaking up with someone. You just gotta do it.
Oh, right, right, shut up.
Oh my God! Oh my God that's awful! What did you think of the house?
They went in together. So sorry.
Hey Joey! Isn't that the girl that waved at you the other day?
Hey guys! What 'cha been doin'?
Ross , foot on the floor or come over no more!
Two. This photographer, who seemed really dull. And this actor guy, who I'm not sure about, because when he called and I answered the phone 'Chandler Bing,' he said 'Whoa-whoa, short message.'
Didn't you hear that speech? If you don't kiss him then I will!
What?
Look it is not my fault that your chairs are incredibly ugly!
In the game room!
Oh my God! That's Pete! But why is Bill huggin' Pete?
Who's he huggin'?
Keep on roaming Bert! We don't want any crazy today!
Guys!?
Because Purvry Perverson over here can't stop staring at her.
What-why?
Wouldn't kick her out of bed. No more Vodka for me!
Oh, ok, thank you. Do you see what all the guys see in her?
Oh, who cares, they still love me! "I am so excited..."
I gotta stop this.
So you can like, bite, and pull people's hair and stuff?
Yeah, it's two guys in a ring, and the rules are "There are no rules."
Okay, I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I-I-I was um, I was taking a nap.
Hi! I just wanna--Ahhh!!! Oh my God! Oh my God!
I'm just saying, if we put just a little bit of makeup on you.
Oh great. So all I need to do is get some new skin. Thank you.
Are we playing football or what? Come on you hairy-backed Marries.
This sucks, I was just up by that much!
Phoebe, y'know why don't we just go upstairs and have some birthday cake?
Like okay I-I-I, I haven't met any Portuguese people! I, I haven't had the perfect kiss! And I haven't been to sniper's school!
You're right, I'm sorry. It's not like you're y'know, going out with an ex-girlfriend.
Honey, it is not a date! I haven't talked to her in ten years! You can't just call up somebody you haven't talked to in ten years and ask them for a favor. There are rules, y'know? You gotta, you got to put in some time.
This is so great! Now we can enter into doubles tournaments!
I don't know.
Oh, that's okay. By the way, I was just checking the shower massager.
Sorry I ah, I scared you in there.
A quin pidio el pollo General Tso?
Aqui est.
God, Ross is on a date with your sister! How weird is that?!
Ugh, she is a slut!
There's no man in here. How dare you accuse me of that.
Joey said that you're in here with another man.
Jellyfish sting! Oh, it hurts! It hurts!! It hurts!!
What?! What?!! What is it?!
I think this is so great! I mean, you and Ross! D-did you have any idea?
OK, is there a mute button on this woman?
I know, Amanda! Ah! She called me too! She's the worst!
Oh, you won't believe who moved back to town.
I can't believe this. Do you think that your parents could help pay for it?
Okay! Now, I'm going to touch you. Ohh, that's soft.
No! Ace is low! Ace, two, three, four!
What? Ace is high! Jack, queen, king, ace!
The dinner will be ready in twenty minutes. This is so exciting.
Hi!
Um, and, well there's the.. the the small matter of...
Oh, good. Thank you.
Inside of telling us you decided to write in your stupid book!
That's right.
Now, this is last minute so I want to apologize for the mess. Okay?
Refill?
Ohh, here you are. Y'know, I'm-I'm glad you decided to hear me out.
We're 29, we're not women.
Umm, going to the beach. When it stays light real late.
What's your favourite thing about summertime?
Hey. Where is he, where's Richard? Did you ditch him?
Hey.
Oh come on! You're making it sound worse than it actually was.
Okay.
Noo! My ex-boyfriend Richard! Y'know the tall guy, moustache?
Richard Simmons?! Oh my God!
Mr. Heckles, our friend lost a monkey. Have you seen it?
Whaddyou want?
I think I feel ok about it. Actually I think I feel really good about it.
How do you feel about that?
I can't leave it! You gouged a hole in my dingy floor.
Aw! Look at that, every inch of this stuff is glued down. It'd take forever to pry this up. You should ah, you should just leave it.
Oh, that's okay, I can't wait to see everything again! All of the memories...
I'm sorry we can't store your childhood things anymore.
Oh, you two must have been so cute running around on a barge.
Well, yeah. Y'know, we were best friends, ever since we were little, our Moms worked on the barge together.
..well, why don't you tell them? After all it, is your ankle.
It's uh...
Excuse me, sir, would it help if I weren't wearing underpants?
Next on the platforms are... ...you two! And... ...You two!
That is the unusual activity. Look, they just wanna see if you're okay.
But I haven't used my card in weeks!
And I assume, Chandler, you are still boycotting all the pilgrim holidays.
Yeah.
Wait, wait, he came up with that himself. Tell them, Chandler.
Really? I've heard better.
Well, I mean I guess there is no harm in putting my name down.
Yeah hon, it can't hurt to put your name down! I mean in if two years if you're not engaged you just don't use it.
Y'know what, that's fine, maybe you haven't grown up, but I have.
Oh my God!
Yeah, but Janice? That-that was like the worst breakup in history!
I snapped, okay? I couldn't handle the pressure and I snapped.
Right, you only go for them 5 minutes before they get married.
Oh, honey, please, no, I can't get started with all that Ross stuff again. I mean, he's gonna screwed up for a looong time. And besides y'know, I don't, I don't go for guys right after they get divorced.
Maybe you don't need him to propose to you, maybe you can propose to him!
She's right! If I were a guy and... Did I just say if I were a guy..?
Rachel! I'm never gonna think it's okay for you to cheat on your husband!
Yes!! I mean sex does not have to be a big deal! There shouldn't be all this rules and restrictions! Y'know, people should be able to sleep with who ever they want, whenever...
Uh, I don't know, butter, eggs, flour, lime, kiwi--
I don't know. What's in this pie?
Passport, check! Camera, check! Traveller's cheques, check!
Don't read my condoms!
Sweetie, I think the glasses look great. They make you look really sexy.
No!
Uh, Rach... how come you have dental floss in your hair?
Pretty well, actually...
Okay, so I'm responsible, I'm organised. But hey, I can be a kook.
Oh c'mon! When we were kids, yours was the only Raggedy Ann doll that wasn't raggedy!
Okay! You get the vacuum cleaner and I'll get the furniture polish!
Do you wanna?
Because we're moving in a couple of days and it just didn't make sense.
Hotel? Why isn't she staying with you guys?
We're not really gonna buy these people steak dinners are we?
Yay!!
Right. Till I bought a blow dryer, then I was shunned.
Well, you're Pennsylvania Dutch, right?
Well, this may sound crazy, but there maybe something we could fashion.
Unless what?
And people will think you own a Porsche because you're wearing the clothes?
No. No, I just uh, I just loved the way it feels when everybody thinks I own a Porsche.
Hey, stay out of this, Chandler! This is between me... and ME!
Don't let yourself get manipulated this way!
Yes! We found you a really cute and funny guy from Chandler's work!
You found me a guy?
That really means a lot. Oh, and Mom, don't bite your nails.
And the next time you cater for me, there will be nothing but ice in the freezer.
We're just two people who find each other very attractive. Right?
Oh, I totally agree.
No it's umm, more like a wrap. Okay so uh, I'm gonna go guys.
Are you makin' him a sandwich?
I guess I set up the video camera to try and entice Joey.
Uhh, Monica?
There's still so much to do. Have you written your vows yet?
Do you realize you get louder each week?
You don't? Well, that's the difference between a professional and a layman.
You do?
Thank you. This is my friend Phoebe. She's gonna be helping me tonight.
Monica? My God you used to be so. . . I mean you, you, you, you must have lost like. . . You look great.
Hey Rach, remember that great song, Me, Myself, and I?
All right, fine.
Yes, a relationship. For your information I am crazy about this man.
Oh please, a relationship.
: then why were you watching them and giving YOURSELF a treat.
no they don't.
Ah, and I mean, he's going out with her? He can not persue this.
Oh my God.
Well, let's just say it's not the first time you've stolen my thunder.
No-no, seriously-seriously, what was the especially me part about?
Doesn't matter, I'll get 'em tomorrow. Or not. Whenever.
Really? Just casually strewn about in that reckless haphazard manner?
Okay, I will. Remember that thing that we just discussed that you wanted to do?
Well, then talk!
Umm, Chandler, if you want I can make you some macaroni and cheese for dinner.
Oh, well, I'm so glad you brought him here then.
I'm fine! I just, I'm thinking how much it's an end of era.
Are you okay? You're not blinking.
They love my candy? Oh man!!! I've gotta go make more!!
Yeah, and they've been coming by all day. They love it!
Oh, some idiot customer put a suggestion in the suggestion box.
So who's idea was it to put everybody in the diner on skates?
I can't believe my parents are actually pressuring me to find one of you people.
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Let her dangle.
Didn't it drive you crazy to have a switch and not know what it did?
Ohh, Nothing.
Oh! Did anybody see that-that documentary on the Korean War?
Well, we can talk about something else. What do you want to talk about? Vivisection? The Vasdeferens? The Vietnam War?
No! No. They're umm... They're just uh...ground beef smileys.
What you got over there? Tacos?
God, you are so lucky. I mean, I mean. . . you know what I mean.
My parents are dead.
Yeah, I asked you and Phoebe to pick up the pies. You did remember, right?
Dessert?
Hey, did you get the turkey bast-Oh my God! Oh my God! Who is that?
Well, of course it smells really bad. You have your head inside a turkey's ass!
Hey, did you get the turkey basted-Oh my God! Oh my God! Who is that?
Hey!
Well I'd probably be scared of a guy using a fake voice.
Okay, so we've established my name, and hit me. But theoretically y'know, I mean say we weren't friends, say it's a blind date. I show up at your door, and I'm like "Hey, nice to meet, ya. Hey, oh-hey."
How hammered are you? Huh? These, these are Joey's sisters.
Okay, how many of that girl are you seeing?
Toe the line. Thread the needle. Think outside the box!
What?
Come on! So she comes to the wedding! I mean it won't be so bad.
Lie!!! How hard is that?! The check's in the mail! Oh your baby is so cute! I can't wait to read your book Ross!!
Ugly Naked Guy's laying kitchen tile. Eww!
What?
Well, I mean what about friends of your grandmother's? Wouldn't they have the recipe?
That's what you think.
I know! I mean it's like me and your dad, that's a totally separate thing.
Y'know I-I thought it was gonna be weird, I mean I almost called and canceled, but it really isn't.
No, Chandler's still in Phase One, and Joey's that thing you smell.
Ohh, gosh. You guys, come on, this is-I have to meet Joshua! This is my one chance for him to see the fun Rachel. Y'know the "Wouldn't it be great if she was my wife" Rachel. Ohh, all right! Are Joey and Chandler back?
Honey, wait. We only did it once. It didn't mean anything to me.
Oh. Oh my God.
Hey! It's me. Mon-i-ca! Can I just tell you how proud I am of you.
Uh-oh.
She's the actress that was in Disclosure, Indecent Proposal, Ghost!
Oh my God! I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Which one's Demi Moore?
Just like you told her you did! ... Just pointing out the irony.
I turned it off. Mother of God, I turned it off!
So your first whole weekend without Ben, what're you guys gonna do?
Ok. He kept my dollar.
Oh, yes, umm, I'm here to pick up a dress that you have on hold.
May I help you ladies?
Hey, Rach, can I borrow your eyelash curler, I think I lost mine.
Yeah, I saw him waiting for an elevator.
Uh, huh. Or maybe to a galaxy far, far away.
Monica, do you want us to take you home?
Oh my God, she's not gonna like the chicken that night either is she?!
What do you think she's just gonna sit there quietly? You don't think she's gonna want to make a toast? You don't think she's gonna want to grab the microphone and sing Part-time Lover?!
Well, maybe the mailman liked the cookies, we just didn't give him enough.
Oh, by the way Mon, I don't think the mailman liked your cookies. Here are the ornaments your mom sent.
I think our lover's spat will start a little early this month.
But I got to act with a robot Pheebs, and-and I don't know anything about technology! I can't even use Chandler's computer except to find porn! And-and that's only 'cause it's right there when you turn it on!
I know, he's just so, so... Do you remember you and Tony DeMarco?
I can see that. You look like you slept with a hanger in your mouth.
We are going to Dick Clark's New Year's Rocking Eve!
It was a dry day.
Yep, we're gonna meet the lady who could be carrying our baby.
Oh, right! Your adoption interview!
No! Umm well, some people say that Oysters are an aphrodisiac.
They have parasites?
Oh it's umm, good! It's umm, it's good, just here watering the plants.
Hey Monica, how's it going.
Joey let me ask you a question. What does this light switch do?
OH...MY...GAWD!!
No-no, I-I really don't want to talk about it! I don't! Especially with you.
Honey, Monica, this is ridiculous! Look...
Dr. Miller? P E C F D.
Okay, just give me the damn drops!
Would you slap me? Would you slap me right here in the face?!
Certainly.
Joey, now that you're okay with the house, do you wanna go see your room?
That's not funny! You know I'm afraid of little girl ghosts!
Oh, I'm so glad you guys like it. Yay! All right I gotta go to work.
Oh yeah.
All right relax Mr. I've Had Sex Four Times!
With Roger? Not just with Roger?! Oh my God!
Hey, how did it go with Mike, is he gonna let you keep the painting?
Hi! Sorry, I'm late.
Do you umm, you really think the best reason to get married is because you're sorry?
I'm doing this because I'm sorry?
Hey Ross! So, I was checking out the uh, real estate section...
Sure, do whatever you want.
No I don't know Chandler! Not anymore! It's like it's like something's changed.
Well, you know Chandler.
Oh, we used to drive each other crazy playing the shadow game.
Ah!!
Why in the world would you take this tape and and why would you watch it?
Monica, look... I don't think you and I have any secrets anymore... Not ready to joke about it yet, okay, I see you later.
When I take a shower, she leaves me little notes on the mirror.
What else?
Ok, let me go check. Your mom want's to say goodbye.
I think I saw Rachel out in the hall.
Well, if we owe it? Oh my... When is Joey gonna be home?
Oh-aw my God! Now, I understand if you never want to sleep with me again, but that would be wrong. We're too good! We owe it, to sex!
All right! Come on Monica! Look alive! Come on, look alive!
Okay. Oh! Oh no.
Well, tonight, I actually went out with Chip Matthews in high school.
Um-hmm.
Dr. Burke? I don't think so. I mean, like, he's a grown up.
Oh, you are so much the smitten kitten. You should ask him out.
Rachel, you are packed though right, I mean please tell me that you're packed.
Well and clearly not a minute sooner.
Well what are you gonna do when he finds out he wasn't even asked?!
I don't even know the man. Okay? We're not the close. I haven't seen him in years.
No no, it's not working on me. Wow! I must be growing up!
Oh! What's the matter? Are you scared? You're afraid I'm a better singer? You're afraid I'm gonna beat you at singing?
Yeah, and we've paid for a room, that we're supposed to be in right now!
Wh.. what? No wait, you don't get to leave! I've got a massage client waiting outside my door any minute!
You guys! Do you realize that any minute now, Phoebe can be pregnant?
I know! Why don't you get drunk! That worked for a lot of girls in my high school.
Limited seating my ass. Let's see who made the cut. Hi!
Oh here, I think this is us. Yeah.
Not never. I mean, I'm gonna see him tomorrow at my eye appointment.
OK, so what, you're just never gonna see him again?
It was a mistake. Please don't take this to mean anything, because it doesn't.
Phoebe and Rachel! So the people that knew about our wedding before me were you, Phoebe and Rachel, Heldi, and apparently some band called Starlight Magic 7 who are available by the way!
Ok, which one of us do you think is gonna be the first one to get married?
All right look. Penis schmenis. We're all people.
Ping pong? Honey, they have ping pong! Let's play!
They have a game room downstairs! Ping pong and stuff.
No it's not! No! No! Now it's about you and Ross getting back together!
It is! It is!
I know, and she's always bragging about all the famous people she's met.
You know what Amanda said to me when she got me on the phone? "Oh, so sorry to catch you on your Mo-Bile!" If-if you don't wanna get me on my mo-Bile, don't call me on my mo-Bile!"
Oh, it was awful. I guess some people just don't appreciate really good food.
Hey, how was your chef thing?
Okay, please be careful with that. It was my grandmother's. Be careful.
Don't make jokes now.
Like I remember his office number! Speed dial 7.
Honey, you've got to go. What's his office number?
Hi. Uh, you... you don't know me, I'm Monica Geller... Ross's sister.
Hey, that coupon expires, you know.
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
I can do it, okay? Come on, let's go.
What these? Oh, these are, um, for.. cuts and scrapes.
I think you may have a drinking problem.
Ohh, I'm such an idiot. I can't believe I actually thought she could change.
This used to be your room? Wow! You must've been in really good shape as a kid.
Why don't you just stop doing stupid things? Then you wouldn't have to apologize.
As bad as that went I actually enjoyed myself. I think that I'm going to apologize for all of the stupid things I do.
Oh, you really want to talk about getting people to like you huh, funny man?
Is that why you became a chef? So that people would like you?
What are you talking about? If you get married in Vegas you're married everywhere.
Yeah, if you get married in Vegas, you're only married in Vegas.
God, this is so hard. I can't decide between lamb or duck.
I think it went into me.
You're still gonna pay me, right? Or something a little less selfish.
What?
Yeah, ah, but Pheebs don't you think he's a little young to get married?
Yeah, isn't it fantastic?
A little tight? I could see double-oh and seven in those pants.
I would but mine doesn't fit. The pants are a little tight.
Hey! Okay, so I thought we'd start with my make up and then do my hair.
Thanks.
Okay, it's baby time. Pants off Bing. Didn't see you there Geller.
Good-bye.
'S'going pretty good, y'know? It's nice, and, we're having fun.
This Alan again? How's it goin'?
I didn't even tell him to say that. . All right you're off my list.
I'm sorry. You're not easy-going, but you're passionate, and that's good. And when you get upset about the little things, I think that I'm pretty good about making you feel better about that. And that's good too. So, they can say that you're high maintenance, but it's okay, because I like ... maintaining you.
Anyway erm, are you going to get a handyman to install this stuff?
Oh...baby-proofing... Why is this such a big deal now? Y'know, when I was a kid it was like.. "Whoops! Joey fell down the stairs!" or er.. "Whoops! Joey electrocuted himself again!" Huh!
Okay, I feel like I'm talking to Lassie. All right, Phoebe would you just tell me!
I don't know!
Yeah, he used to have this recurring nightmare, just really freaked him out.
He saw a therapist?
Yeah sure, nature called, she wanted to see who else did.
You just thought of that in there?
Ok, but if something gets broken, and then the Queen comes over..
What is the point of having them if we never use them?
Hey Rach, the tampons here are only a penny. Let's stock up.
I ate a bug.
Look look! It's Rachel and Barry. No, don't everybody look at once!
Oh, no-no-no-no. Last time I left a spontaneous message I ended up using the phrase "Yes indeedy-o."
Guys, rules are good! Rules help control the fun! Ohhh!
I think I'm gonna take-off.
Forget it. Not after your cousin who could belch the alphabet.
Monica, I'm tellin' you, this guy is perfect for you.
Wait, what about the time I hit you in the face with the Silvian's pumpkin?
Oh.
We ripped that couple apart, and kept the pieces for ourselves.
Excellent.
Oh, it's so beautiful. Ohh! Y'know, I-I don't know if I feel right about this.
Well, Ross and Emily aren't gonna use it.
Sweetie, you know I have no sense of humor when it comes to the wedding.
I figured I'd buy those. Pat, I'd like to buy a vow.
Rach? Can I talk to for just a minute? I-I dropped some socks.
Umm, listen, I'm gonna need to take a rain check, my roommate is just really sick. Okay? Bye! Honey, listen, I know, I know things seem so bad right now.
No, but she likes me. You abandoned her on a plane to Greece.
Oh, so-so you talked to her. Did she, did she sound mad?
Well, this must've brought back some really bad memories for you, Ross.
Okay.
And then he told me he would run away with me, and he didn't.
Yes, yes it is true. And I know this because, because he pretended to be Drake to, to sleep with me.
Did you also have his album, It's Not Easy Being Green?
Oh! I used to do that too!
I'm guessing your new girlfriend wouldn't urinate on my coffee table.
'That thing'? This is how you greet guests at a party? Let me ask you something, if I showed up here with my new girlfriend, she wouldn't be welcome in your home?
Ooh! I'm sorry! I think, I THINK, that may have missed the table!
AAAHHHH!
Y'know, I-I... I have to figure...some st-Y'know, some stuff before I can...
I know.
Yes, I will start with the carpaccio, and then I'll have the grilled prawns.
Do I dare ask?
I need two. I'm bringing Pete. My boyfriend. I have a boyfriend now!
I had one.
Oh Ross, sometimes grown-ups have commitments they just can't get out of!
Yeah, I was but uh, she was a little busy with a water balloon fight.
Wait a minute, wait a minute. Yes he is. You are totally different.
She's right. She's right. You are no different than the rest of them.
Say it louder, I don't think the guy all the way in the back heard you!
Oh my God! You're a 30 year old virgin!
I can't belive it, I'm gonna be an aunt. I'm gonna have like a nephew.
Monica, come on now. Let's go, baby coming.
Michelle! Of course, it was Michelle! Did it sound like Michelle?
Maybe it was his sister's. You know, maybe it was his daughter's.
Well, next time your massaging him, you should try and distract yourself.
No, I know! I-I'm sorry, but the moment I touch him, I just wanna throw out my old oath and take a new, dirty one.
Ok, you're being wierd. Do you want sex or did you do something bad?
Oh no..don't thank me. Thank you. You know there's not one thing I would change about you? Not one single thing! And definitely not... two... single things.
Excuse me, Mrs. Burkart? Well, we're all cleaned up in the kitchen.
Oh, all right. Oh! Look what we almost took!
Ugh, they sent me home. They said I can't work if I'm sick.
Hey, what are you doing here? Shouldn't you be at work?
Oh Rachel don't, don't you dare, don't, don't. Tell him I cook.
OK, I'm doin' it for ya.
Hey, we would still be living here if hadn't gotten the question wrong!
That is not true. She did! She forced me!
Carol called me to thank me for the lasagna, I asked, she told me.
Wha, heh, how could you know, I don't even know!
Look what I found in the drawer... And you said I'd never wear this...
Okay.
Oh! It was our pleasure. We are so much enjoying getting to know you.
Thanks so much for showing me around.
What I said was, was that I understood. Joey's the one who agreed with you!
That's what you said last night.
Oh, I asked one of the waitresses at work if she'd help me out.
Ten dollars an hour for what?
Which we are, and-and we already paid for it. It's My Giant!
Well, I suppose I'd have to say you!! But, what if we're watching a movie in here?
Wendy, we had a deal! Yeah, you promised! Wendy! Wendy! Wendy!
Last time I do that, I promise.
Where's Benny? There he is! Where's Benny, there he is.
Well, I think you should seriously consider the marriage thing, give Rachel another chance to dress up like Princess Bubble Yum.
Cute PJ's! You're really livin' it up here in London huh?
Hey!
No, but... I saw the previews. They played it right before Jackass.
You saw that?
No! You don't know the system! There'll be nobody messing with the system!
Need some help?
Do you think things would have been better if you'd just told her the truth?
I'm not sure I know what you're getting at.
Dr. Greene. Oh my God it's Rachel's dad. What're you doing here?
Oh that's nice. Happy birthday Rachel, here's some goo.
Yes, I want to change. And why-why don't you go down and get us a table?
Yes, we do. But, we have to change first.
Were not doing anything. Were just sitting around talking, quietly.
Youre doing it again.
Oh that's so sweet! Look Chandler I don't care if you can't cry, I love you.
Yeah I know, but I figured a shot y'know? Maybe one of those stories would make me cry and then you wouldn't think I was y'know, all dead inside.
We're gonna pick up the wedding dress then we're gonna have lunch with mom.
Oh, where are you guys going?
I know! I know! And he totally freaked out and I can't find him anywhere!
Well for the regular guy, it's bad, but Chandler, Oh dear God!
You'll be fine. Nah, you won't, but I'll be back in two minutes.
It's just that we've never spent any time, you know, alone together.
Op, can I just tell you something? Very flattered but umm, I'm engaged.
Hi!
You are so sweet to notice! Yes, I lost three and a half pounds!
Ohh, so do you! Did you lose weight?
Frannie was the one who found your Playboys and showed them to mom.
Now wait a minute, you be nice! All right? I didn't bring you here so you can ambush her.
This is so great! This is exactly how we set the plates at the restaurant.
Okay, I'm a rookie. I should not be in the end zone.
'Cause I ran into him at the bank, he is still soo cute.
The guy who took Rachel to the prom? Why is he calling you?
Oh, honey, I forgot. I promised Treeger that we'd leave our keys.
Do you realise we almost made it ten years without that coming up?
well no offense honey, but your taste is a little feminine for me.
Why?
Phoebe! Come on! Let's go! Come on! Why aren't you dressed yet?!
I did it anyway.
What if my own baby hates me? Huh? What am I gonna do then?
Come on, don't do this.
Oh no, she's still at work, but she told me to tell you to call her.
What is ah, Rach in her room?
Ah, come on, sneakers are easy. You wear sneakers all the time.
What am I supposed to do with these?
I just thought that if I could follow the wire I could find out what it did.
I don't care! The wires have come loose in your head!
Wow. My brother never even told me when he lost his virginity.
You know what else? He's unbelievable in bed.
Oh, hang on, hang on. Does Aunt Monica get a say in this?
That's right, you're gonna spend tomorrow at Aunt Rachel's, aren't you.
I got one. "Socks. Because your family's feet deserve the best."
I mean, I can write slogans. I mean, how hard can it be, right? "Cheese. It's milk that you chew." "Crackers. Because your cheese needs a buddy." "A grape. Because who can get a water melon in your mouth?"
I don't know. Hey, Rachel, you want the big plate? I want you to have the big plate.
What the hell is that?
'Cause, Gary and Phoebe think they're a hotter couple than we are!
Why?
Oh... Yes, I'm sure. Oh honey, let's go. Okay bye everyone.
Ooh! Are you sure?
STOP IT!! ...Oh my God. It's true! Who am I?
Someone's left a glass on the coffee table. There's no coaster. It's a cold drink, it's a hot day. Little beads of condensation are inching their way closer and closer to the surface of the wood...
Have a seat. Okay, listen umm, Chandler and I are going to live together, here.
All yours babe.
I'm telling you, she went to the airport, and she's gonna go for it with Ross!
No way!
Okay, the red ones are my guests and the blue ones are yours.
Oh wow. Why don't we just take me and put me with a Manhattan in my hand, talking to the cute bartender. These pins aren't for playing are they?
Because they don't know we're dating. Do you think we should eat in the kitchen?
Why can't I tell them that we live together?
You should feel great about yourself! You're doing this amazing independence thing!
C'mon, sit. Just sit down, sit.
I know, but y'know, this time you're gonna definitely know whether or not you did it!
Oh totally, totally. Y'know it's not that big of deal, we already kinda did it once y'know.
Hey, you know I got a question for ya. Just a little thing, no pressure.
Awww! You know that's probably why babies learn to talk, so they can tell grown ups to cut it out.
Not the way they're doing it. What, what happened? How did she die?
It's okay. Actually y'know what, it's kinda cool. 'Cause it's like y'know, one life ends and another begins.
Because... I'm Monica Geller. It was my credit card you were using.
I'm not too bad. Fortunately, blue's my colour. How-how did you know I was here?
I don't know. I mean, I guess having sex in front of a baby isn't so...
Well, I can't say "hump" or "screw" in front of the B-A-B-Y.
Wow! All right well, I mean, what can you do? If you lost it you lost it.
Umm, I lost one of your earrings. I'm sorry! I am so, so sorry!
Who's so brave, you're so brave, yes you are, you're so brave.
Here. Ben, do you wanna play the airplane game, do you wanna show Rachel? Come here. We're gonna do something fun. Okay. Weee!! Weee!!
Yeah! But, he can't not exactly see Emily, I mean that's his wife.
Well, you can't just not see Rachel anymore, she's one of your best friends.
Uh, so anyway, we thought one of you could read something during the ceremony.
Monica said wedding.
Ohh, he's really shy. I-I don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet.
So Mon, when are we gonna meet this new secret waiter man?
Oh good, another dinosaur story. When are those gonna become extinct?
I love how he cares so much about stuff. If I squint I can pretend he's Alan Alda.
Now another way to organise your stuffed animals, is by size.
Some can sing, some can dance. I apparently can turn phallic cakes into woodland creatures.
What does he think? Does he think I'm just gonna wait around for nothing?
I don't know! I haven't totally decided how to talk on my boat yet.
Just a little but...it's just so scary! I don't even know what I would sing...
OK so isn't there a little part of you that wants to get up there?
Uhm, she has been showing us houses outside of the city.
Why do you have a realtor?
It worked! Ooh baby baby baby, ooh baby baby baby!
Have I gone deaf?
Yeah, it's just we don't think of you as really being so much "with the words".
Joey, we would've asked you, we just thought you wouldn't be interested.
Ok, alright, you guys, you'd better sit down, this is pretty big.
What's going on?
Two it is. Ok, time for bed, I'm gonna go brush my teeth.
Well, I mean what can I say? I, I was married to Barbara for 30 years. She was my high school sweetheart, now you, that's two.
Hey, thank you. Thank you so much. . You are SO going to Heaven!
Yeah, I did.
Now there you go! I wouldn't want my best guest to strain her eyes!
This is where I keep the pizza. And-Hey! Where did the napkin go?!
Okay. We have got to beat them! {Here we go yet again.}
Uh, yeah.
Okay, one more, please. Come on, I'm gonna get it in this time, I will.
Oh, yeah! Okay! Great! Go, man, go put on your shoes, and, and march out there and meet her! Oh, wait, no, no you have to take a shower, 'cause, eww. No, you know what you have to answer her, answer her first. No, no, you know what make some coffee 'cause its too much.
Well yeah, but, you know, uh, 27 is a dangerous eye age.
Didn't you like, just get your eyes checked?
Well, we... "bore false witness"... See I could be a reverend.
So you lied to me before?
Got it! Got it! Got it! Got it! Got it! Got it!
No its really okay... Monica!
Wow, Monica! What an amazing opportunity to influence... dozens of people.
Well, I'm gonna fill in for him as food critic for the Chelsea Reporter.
Aren't you afraid that Joey's going to figure all of this out? I heard it.
Hear me out woman. I'll go down the fire escape. Then, I'll wait for a while. Then, when I come up the stairs, it'll be just like I just got back from Tulsa. Then, Joey and I will come in and see that there's no guy in here.
No! no! Let's figure out a fair way to decide who's staying.
Well, oh, ok now... Only one of us has to stay with Emma. Ok, and as the person who realized that, I get to go!
Umm, listen I am sorry, but I'll put some out first thing in the morning.
I am sorry, but some of us have to get up early and go to work! He does not know that I am not some of us.
You want a job? Turn off "Oprah," and send out a resume!
Well, I think it's great that you're going on a date, you know? I mean, it sounds healthy. I mean, you have needs. Embrace your womanhood!
Thank you. It was so beautiful. I'm going to go to Joeys and get the pies.
It's all right. You can mourn.
It's harder for me! I have those four other women to compete with!
I do like that.
Probably some y'know, European good-bye thing he picked up in London.
See ya!! What the hell was that?!
Come on! Come on, I was kidding! It was such an obvious joke!
What?!!
Well, we thought we would all go to a picnic , in Central Park!
Ohh, that's so nice! How great! Well, where? Where's the trip?!
Hey Maureen! Gosh! Hey uh, Chandler? This is my cousin Maureen.
Hi! If you're calling before Saturday, you've reached Monica and Chandler. But if you're calling after Saturday, you've reached Mr. and Mrs. Bing! Please leave a message for the Bings!
Joey, we had a deal. That-that's why you're here! I've got to fire you!
I am so-so-so sorry. I was gonna do it! Really! But I was standing there with 327 dollars in one hand and 238 dollars in the other hand, and I was thinking, "Wow! It's been a long time since I had... 327 + 238 dollars!"
Well, he did manage to keep his identity secret for a long time.
Ross is Batman!
Joey, did you even interview this woman before you asked her to move in?
Oh, hey let me.
It's goin' great. Right on schedule. Got my little happy helpers.
How's it going?
So that marriage stuff that you were saying yesterday, you don't really believe that do you?
Wh-no, but y'know who did stop in here looking for ya, Tennille.
All right shut up for a second and let me just see something. Oh, wow!
I'm sorry things didn't work out...
I want you to meet someone really special. Phoebe, this is Erica. And this is the baby!
Hey.
Well, they're just gonna have to wait aren't they? I've only got two hands!!
Hey, there's uh, some people outside, askin' about candy.
There's something that we wanna tell you. We decided to name the girl-baby Erica.
We're going to take Erica to recovery now.
No way! You had your party, now I have mine! Is everything alright?
Hi. Thanks for the party, honey. Should I help you clean up?
Wait! Wait! Wait! You can't start today! Today's the rehearsal dinner!
Oh that's great!
You are going to make a joke about my special present! Why would you do that?!
Op, but the twelfth brings a lover's spat.
Okay, I'll rest. But y'know if I'm going to bed, then you're coming with me.
I know, let's rest and drink lots of fluids.
Well, with all these doctors and nurses, I'm gonna say, midget rodeo.
Where are we?
Oh that's cute! We really all enjoyed it. But y'know, it doesn't count.
The most popular Phoebe in tennis is called the overhand Phoebe. And if you win, you must slap your opponent on the Phoebe and say, "Hi, Phoebe!"
Hello? Oh yes, one minute please. It's for you. It's the fire inspector.
Okay.
Come on, okay, come on this is for all womankind. Let's kill 'um!
Oh my God! You dated someone with a glass eye too?!
Hey Rach, come on! We're gonna be late for the eye doctor appointment!
Thank you.
Oh, then you do know it. So um what kind of things do you write about?
Actually I ah, I am a poet.
Oh my God, he's gonna do it now. Please, I cannot watch this, let's go.
Uh, Phoebe, uh, I have... something I wanna say.
OK, great. You'll tell us and we'll laugh. Let's play poker.
Oh God, oh, and then she told the funniest story...
What does the red X next to Bob Greenmore's name mean?
Oh!
Come on, that was back in high school! How could that still bother you?
Monica! I couldn't find him for two hours! He was having sex with Amy Welch!
Hey, hold on there, tiger. How's it going? How you holding up?
Oh, no, no, no. Presents first. Food later.
I-I am serious, I mean, we're, we're all over each other all the time.
Come on, seriously! When did it end?
Well, do you think he was waiting 'til after you left, so he could cry?
No.
Alright, here we go. We've got salmon roulettes and assorted crudites.
Oh, you're...
Oh no no no no... this is dangerous territory. Keep it clean!
Thanks, you look good too.
Oh, is that why you did it the secret hallway where nobody ever goes?!
I swear, I never wanted any part of your night!
No, he didn't! He pretended to be a Quaker to get out of Korea.
Hey, hey, hey, hey! I'm not gonna mess with Jack, he's a great man, he fought for our country.
Look, I-I'm never gonna let you up so you may as well just go away.
Why? So you could hang up on me?
I'm telling-If you put that in her apartment you'll never hear the end of it.
Yeah! I made it of this fruit bowl I found in the garbage.
Ross! She's giving us her baby. She can eat you if she wants.
Erica, those things aren't free. In fact they have one of the highest mark-ups of any consumer product...
: I saw what you were doing in Tulsa. angry sharks turn you on!
let ME be a part of this!
Vomit tux? Who vomited on-y'know what, what you up to Joe?
Don't worry, I had it dry-cleaned.
Phoebe, it's okay that you don't want me to be your girlfriend because I have the best boyfriend.
I'm off the list.
No I didn't, I said kiwi lime. That's what makes it so special.
Kiwi? Kiwi? I thought it was a key lime pie.
Oh, that's because I had lunch with Rich-Me neither! Okay, what do I want now?
Yes!! I love you! I can't even remember what we were fighting about!
All right, that's it. You know what? Just get out of my way and stop moping.
I don't know. It's just not the same without Mom in the kitchen.
Y'see, this is where you'd use that 'hello' word we talked about.
She answered.
No-no-no that was good, it was, that was uh, that was a goood kiss...
No-no really, was-was that not okay?
Oh no! My parents have never seen me drunk! That they know of.
Yes!!
It's gonna be weird to watch some actor pretending to be Ben's dad.
All right, I gotta take off. I'm picking up Ben then we're off to the big audition.
No, my eye doctor is Richard! I can't go to him when I don't have a boyfriend!
Honey, maybe we should take you to a doctor.
I'm gonna leave some cards here. Please think of us for you next event.
Good.
Y'know when I said to you earlier that I was at work umm, I'm at my new work.
Oh! What a great way to earn some extra pocket money.
No, no really. I.. I wouldn't feel right about it. Just some water.
If... if you want to drink, it's OK with me, I've got to get used to it.
Oh! And don't let me leave without getting the name of that carpet guy.
Remember, a virgin for me please.
Okay, but wouldn't it be easier if you had to tell me something that you could tell me.
But I can't tell you.
Sure! It doesn't mean anything! Just like I know it doesn't mean anything with you!
So umm, you-you flirt with guys all the time?
But what if it is better than ours? Should we at least look?
We close escrow tomorrow, so seeing another house can only confuse us, and we're easily confused. We're not very bright.
Ah, thank you. This building does have a wholesome family feel to it.
Your place is just lovely.
We don't have much time. Once the egg descended the oviduct ...
Do, do you gonna do it now?
: sweetie it's ok, I still love you, let me be a part of this.
What's going on?
Yeah, and I wanted her to get to know the doctors and get settled into the hotel.
Hey, well, in a couple of weeks I won't be able to travel.
Oh that's my doodle of a ladybug, with a top hat. She's fancy.
What's that on the bottom?
Oh my God! Joey, what did you do after you threw her leg on the fire?
I wish. See, I guess another thing I probably should've told you about Ginger is that she kinda has a ah, artificial leg.
Oh that's okay. Don't worry about it, you can give it to me when we get back.
How do you feel about the, "I really did forgot the present, please forgive me" not fake out?
When you were reading the dirty magazines without taking off the plastic!
I was with you the whole time we were in Connecticut, when did you even get those?
Oh my God! No wonder I get such great service at Cafe Maurice.
Well, you just asked if I wanted to go to bed with you tonight.
Wait wait wait. I was at home the whole time. How did I missed that?
Yeah. It was after the party, we were on the balcony and...
All right, well why don't I go out with an ex-boyfriend and do Joey a favor?!
Not once!
I can't believe we are at a real college party! I have to pee so bad!
Remember that big party? Freshman year? A week before Christmas vacation? I do. You had some visitors.
Mira, Ross, Marcel se llevo el control remoto.
Hola, amigos!
Oh, you came to tell him you love him! I knew it! I was right! I'm right, right?
I was going to call him, but...
I'm glad you're here, we have a couple of things to ask you about the wedding ceremony.
No.
Uh, listen, I need that broiling pan that Joey borrowed the other day.
Hey!
This is so unfair! She's got everything I want, and she doesn't have my mother.
Nooo...
You have to help me! I'm supposed to be writing my vows and all I have is this!
What is the emergency?!
Oh, Nancy Thompson from Phoebe's old massage place is getting fired.
No, he visited a little town south of throw up. So what was Phoebe's secret?
Joey, this is sick, it's disgusting, it's, it'snot really true, is it?
Oh, like you've never gotten a little rambunctious with Ross.
You know what? This has been kind of a girlie day. You're right, I'm sorry.
Yes, but I feel like I've really gotten in touch with my feminine side enough today. You know. In fact I think we're two sachets away from becoming a lesbian couple.
You know what probably happened? Someone musta stolen my credit card.
Mon, if uh you were at lunch alone, how come it cost you uh 53 dollars?
Rose Marie really belongs on a smaller screen, doesn't she?
Woah!
Ohhh! No! This is my friend Rachel, we went to High School together.
I know, here-here!!
Uhm, we just wanna give you a heads-up. Bill and Colleen hate us.
Hey.
Okay! There's only one left, three letter word, not dog but...
Aww, me too. Now let's finish this and go to bed.
Hey guys! Do you wanna look at the song list for the wedding? Guys?
Okay!
Well, you don't have to decide right now, but if you could just look at our file...
Giving you my baby? You think I'd give you my child after this?
Wow! Play that message for Emily and this whole problem goes away!
Hey Ross! It's you! I just want you to remember this feeling. You are lucky to be alive! So live everyday to the fullest. Love yourself, okay? Okay. Oh, and also get stamps. Bye!
All right, hand me that other box of photos; that's the very last one.
Great! Thanks!
Oh my God! Did you hear that? She hired me because she thinks I'm good.
Oh, well Richard raved about the food at his party, of course you were sleeping with him. Then I heard the food at that lesbian wedding was very nice, I assume you weren't sleeping with anybody there. Though, at least that would be something.
I have no idea, but X-rays alone could be a couple hundred dollars.
Why, how much is this gonna cost?
"Oh my God, I love Ross! I hate Ross! I love Ross! I hate Ross!"
Hey! I call her!
So, I'm, I'm probably still ovulating. Do you want to give it another try?
Mhum.
I'm just having one of those days where you realize you're in a dead-end relationship!
Whoa-whoa, what's the matter?! Talk to the captain!
Ohh, I've always wanted to go to this culinary fair that they have in Jersey!
Yeah, I can say that I have a conference and you can say you have a chef thing.
...They threw us out! I was thrown out of a hotel! Me!
So once they caught on to the fact that we're, y'know, short and have breasts...
Yes! All right, y'know what? Why don't we start with a practice run? Okay?
Really?!
Ross's apartment is nice! How come we don't hang out here more often?
It's just my knitting that's all! Yes! I knit this. I'm very good.
Ice, ice, ice squares anyone? Take a napkin. Alright.
It's hard to tell because I'm sweating, but I use exactly what the gel bottle says, an amount about the size of a pea. How, how can that be too much?
Now you think I wouldn't enjoy that, because it is so fake, but I still do.
Well, I was going to, but then I figured, you know... you're food is so delicious and perfect, you can never have too many of those pumpkin things.
Listen...I need to know that what I'm about to ask you, will never get back to Chandler.
Hey!
They've elected me to talk to you about the baby talk - it's not so good.
Bye.
Oh, Aunt Liddy's coming? That means we get five dollars each!
She went to pick up Aunt Liddy.
I gotcha. Sorry. So, did you ever make him throw up a whole anything?
No, not us... Us!
This dinner is gonna be so great! In your face, last year "me"!
Can't wait!
Yeah, I do think it's better this way. Yeah, we're being smart. Yes, I'm sure.
So, how'd the lasagne go over? Really?! Good. So you owe me three pretty things. Yeah, I've been thinking a lot about you too. I know. It's hard this whole platonic thing. It's a word!
Well, he told me he was going out with the guys, I just didn't know that you were the guys.
Yeah, didn't he tell ya?
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Phoebe. It's just a little shorter than what we had discussed.
Yeah, but this isn't the face of a person who trusts a person. Ok, this is the face of a person who, you know, doesn't trust a person.
Come on...I just need it for some rent and..and some other bills.
And I think he would tell you it was a mistake.
Ross used to stay up every Saturday night to watch Golden Girls!
Once Monica was sent to her room without dinner, so she ate the macaroni off a jewelry box she'd made.
Chandler, listen to me sweetie, I know you can do this. Okay? You have a beautiful smile.
No, I am.
It wasn't funny at all! Why would you do that? Why didn't you pick me?
I guess it was kinda funny.
Do you want me to cry? Is that what you want? Do you wanna see me cry?
Monica, how did this happen? I thought you had this all planned out.
Wow, that is a surprise. Just one little question, uh, why not Ross's room?
Well sweetie, we have a surprise for you. We're turning your room into a gym.
So you wanna tell us now, or are we waiting for four wet bridesmaids?
Hi.
Chandler! I have to tell you, you smell so smokey I have to get up. I'm not kidding.
Okay, but you gotta push past this because it is about to get so good!
It's my new perfume. Why don't you come closer where you can really appreciate it?
I'm doing just fine! God, Tiffany, you smell so great!
Oh, what a great gift! Is The Way You Look Tonight on it?!
But I made you a tape of what I think are all romantic songs.
Well, now's a good time. I'm on my way to have my ears cut off.
Hey. I need to tell you something.
Now are drawers will smell nice and we didn't waste these pantyhose.
Hello. Oh good. Ross could you put up some of these flyers for me? OH!! Demon!! Demon!!
Look, I don't wanna do this test either, but I really do think it's a good idea!
I cannot believe Ross told you that! And in my defense, it was a Wendy's!
I'm sick of the signs! It's too fast, I'm happy the way things are!
All right, should we just, should we just get married? Y'know? I mean should we just do it? All the signs are telling us to do it.
Hey, honey, my test is down the hall, are you sure you're going to be ok?
Deposit my specimen? You know, usually I have to call a 900 number for that kind of talk. Thanks, got it.
You were the next caller five hours ago. You must be going crazy.
Thank you for your patience, you're the next caller.
Hi Honey! We're all here; we just want to wish you a Merry Christmas.
Ah. Chandler Bing.
I got it! How about, if we win, they have to get rid of the rooster?
Okay, so let's play for some pepper! Stop spending my money!
The basket is totally empty! My God, the neighbors ate all the candy!
No, I've just always wanted to do that. Can you help me clean this up?
Oh, you can't show Phoebe this! She hates those corporate massage chains.
Oh, it's a gift certificate to this new SPA in SOHO.
Why, it's dinner for six. 5 steaks, and an eggplant for Phoebe.
Oh, it's like a skit.
Hey. So um, I was thinking that maybe we should start dividing up our stuff.
Hey!
They wouldn't have put it there if it didn't do something! How can you not care?
I know what it did! Nothing.
Danny? You know Rachel? She's nice. She's not bad to look at, right?
Hey Danny.
Do you remember that jacket that you love so much, that you thought was too expensive?
Yeah!
Let me put it this way. We're having sex whether you're here or not.
I don't feel like having sex. Maybe we can watch a movie or something.
Good, so do it Saturday night because we're going to dinner with her and Clark.
Yes!!!
Oh God! He's gonna come by and borrow some candles for his big date!
Oh, I wish there was a job where I could wear this all the time. Maybe someday, there will be.
Since we've been going out, I think I've mentioned his name twice!
Oh, Richard. That's all I ever hear, Richard, Richard, Richard!
Maybe Joey doesn't have to give you the money, TV stars have assistants right?
Ehh.
I know this is embarrassing, but nobody cares! No one here even knows you!
Yeah, I guess!
Y'know what? It really creeps me out choosing other people's sex clothes.
Hey, Mon, if you were hoping to sleep with Joshua the first time tonight, which one of these would you want to be wearing.
Okay. I'm gonna be the mom that makes the world's best chocolate chip cookies.
Break my heart-Oh, all right.
I understand, but you're wishing for what we think you're wishing for, aren't you?
Can't really say!
Hey Rach, a guy from Ralph Lauren called, you got a second interview!
Thanks Chandler.
Come on! Come on! Hurry! We're running out of time! Huddle up!
Okay, okay, so we get to take that stupid troll thing home!
What?! Why? Why is this crazy? So this isn't the ideal way to something....
Crazy.
No. I think we learned that from the sugarlips incident. I'm gonna get some tea.
Yeah, see, I can't pull of baby-doll can I?
Rachel, I need to borrow-You're not packed!!!! You're not packed even a little bit!
Well, what you're wearing is fine for that.
Oh! I hate that guy! I mean come on kid! Pull up your pants!
Sense the tone! No that kid Nate got it.
You're wrong! The centerpieces are fine! Do you ever get scared at all?
Okay. Well, I think the centerpieces are too big
Really? Wow! It looks like I had some trouble staying inside the lines.
Yeah. Yeah, oh you loved that thing. You always had it with you. You never went anywhere without-without that coloring book.
Well, it doesn't really matter ... you're both wishing for the same thing, right?
I hope I win!
And what if I was still fat? Well, you wouldn't be dating me, that's for sure.
Maybe the problem was you were pronouncing it kara-tay.
Uh, ah. Unless you wanna stay over? I mean, I'm going to, so...
What?
Bye! Ten bucks says, I never see that woman again in my life.
Bye!
I'm telling you, something's wrong! My brother does not stay out all night.
Okay y'know what, because you said that, I'm not putting out tonight.
Maybe I can try at intermission? Phoebe, come on... you know what? Let's just go!
You didn't get the money, did you?
'Cause if you do that means you'd be cancelling it for me, and we're just friends.
Okay.
The second sister dies in Archie and Jughead Double Digest?
No. No, I-I was, I was talking about the book I was reading.
So umm, when I was in the shower I was thinking about our first night in London...
Happy Anniversary, 10 months!
Oh no-no-no, stay, stay, stay, just keep talking. I'm always the hostess.
Look, Mon, do you want us to uh, come back later?
Yeah, come on, eat, whatever you want. Dr. Roger got beeped again.
Okay to come in?
So you can't lose, it's there in the title. Wonderfullness is baked right in.
It's a Wonderful Life. Yes I've heard of this.
I know there'll be other houses, but it's just so... I love that one so much.
And about this Nancy thing... If you're not sleeping with her, should I?
Oh, great! Just what you want for a new house with infants. Bird feces.
Really? You got us a chick and a duck?
Chandler, this is not our problem. We've got each other. That's all that matters.
Oh, yeah, well, poor Richard. Y'... I can grow a moustache!
So what if he wants to sleep with her? I mean, she's single and he's cute.
We ran into him on the street today and he said he might have a job for her. But I know he just wants to get into her pants.
Oh, you're so sweet. Oh, but wait, what about our, what about the future and stuff?
Yeah, I'm putting my foot down. Yeah look, when I proposed I told you that I would do anything to make you happy, and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy then, then that's what we're gonna do.
I'm gonna go put my make up on, we have to be at the hotel in an hour!
I know. At dusk. That's such a hard time for me.
I guess with you doing the internship, we're just spending more than we're bringing in.
I'm not sure what they did, but I'm inclined to blame Enron.
Hi. We checked the third and fourth floor, no-one's seen Marcel.
Cat! What'm I saying? Cat!
You're not gonna go anywhere, you said you were gonna eat here, and you're gonna eat here!
Dude, we were good!
Because that's where the party is you goon. See this is just the staging area.
Uhh, yes, absdolutely, um. Why again?
How about you go put on your 007 tuxedo and I'll make you a nice martini.
Batman has Robin! We get ESPN right?
Hey, maybe I'll drive you up there! I'd like to buy some tickets myself!
Yeah Connecticut...Not West Virginia.
They all came from the list you handed out to us two weeks ago.
Good ones?
But what kind of a sick bastard wants to do it in front of a deer?
You guess I'm right? When we stayed at that bed and breakfast, you wouldn't have sex with me because you thought a deer was staring through the window.
You had sex in his chair?!... I said that a little too loudly, didn't I?
We ended up having sex in his chair.
All right look, if I take Chandler out of the running will you be able to focus?
It's hard, y'know, his huddle is closer to Dutch girl.
All right. We're gonna go. It's not for another six hours. We're gonna go then.
Fine.
Wait a minute, I think Phoebe's right. You know I hear someone else in there with him.
He could be alone. This morning I heard him do push-ups, and then talk to his triceps.
What are you talking about? She just invited him to the biggest party of the millennium!
I don't think so.
OK, I'll go. OK, senior year of college... on a pool table.
Alright, somebody.
Well fine! I want to meet this chicken expert! Send the Colonel in!
She says it's to dry now and she wants to come back here and explain to you exactly how she wants it.
Ohh, Please?! I'm a single mom, with a thirty year old son!!
Ahh, you know what? That is....Who wouldn't want you?
You! It's not like it's a big deal! You-you don't still do it or anything!
Okay, okay, I'll tell 'em it wasn't Chandler who got high. Now who should I say it was?
Well, y'know how I always wanted to go out with Chip Matthews in high school?
So, how was your date?
Chandler could you at least send some women to my party? Alright that's Ross.
Alright you guys are off to party number one and you, you are off to party number two Alright fellas, let's keep it movin', let' keep it movin.
I would get a room with this cake. I think I could show this cake a good time!
My God, get a room!
I don't know! Time to kiss a guy maybe?! What are you laughing at Pampers?
Quick! What time is it?!
But we were hoping that since we told you the truth that you still might consider...
I can't believe this.
Baddest. Otherwise the song would be Fat Fat Leroy Brown.
Monica... Hey Mon, I have a question. Is Leroy the baddest man in the whole damn town or the fattest man in the whole damn town?
See what happens when you give people advice? I hope you told him not to?
David is going to propose to Phoebe tonight!
Okay, I'd like to know how much the room was because I'd like to pay my half.
Monica.
Pheebs, you remember how we talked about saying things quietly to yourself first?
Oh my God. You'd put that poor little creature in jail?
Couldn't you just stay like this forever? Chandler! Couldn't you just stay here forever?
Hmm.
Went down to the docks. Bet ya didn't know you could get it wholesale.
Where'd you get fruit at four in the morning?
I mean, I realize that his feelings may never completely go away, but you can.
Feelings, such strong feelings.
Oh! You assume because I was heavy that's the only way I could win something?
Pie eating contest?
Well, y'know I-I-I think I'm gonna respect the privacy of my new secret boyfriend.
Chandler! Is he?
In the beginning where y'know it's all sex and talking and sex and talking and...
Yes. Right where?
Probably the only time I'll ever say this, but did you see the ass on her?
I know!
ooohh... hey! Wanna stick around and I'll whip you up some dinner?
I'm sorry too...
Rachel, what are you doing? Its freezing out here. Would you come back inside?
Yeah, um, may we help you?
What? We took a walk, nothing happened. I can back with nothing all over me.
All right, that's it, you guys! What happened out there?
Oh. So nice of her to pull my hair, 'till I dropped the key!
Hey Mon, that was really nice of you to loan Rachel your car so she could go and get the cake.
You know, when you start get screwed over all the time, you gotta switch to low-fat.
Yeah, well that's that lo-cal, non dairy, soy milk junk. We sort of, we save the real stuff for those really terminal cases.
Do NOT let me sit in one of those. We'll be here for days.
Oh.
Ok, everybody, there's food and drinks on the table. Go across the hall.
All right.
It meant nothing! Okay? After all this time, how can you not trust me?
No! Her boyfriend Richard!
Yeah! Okay, this one is a mushroom cap. Umm, this one is made of bologna.
Wow! This looks great!
OK, we done with the chit-chat? Are we ready to play some serious poker?
Ooooh, that's fine. We'll see who has the last laugh there, monkey boy.
They're all in there! Even these five that I hid in my bra ...
Hey Monica, what about your extra tickets?
You wanna go right now? 'Cause I'll take you right now, buddy! You wanna go?
Yeah.
What?! You paid a thousand dollars for a cat when you owe me 300!!
Doesn't sound as crazy as paying a thousand dollars for a cat.
All right, he's keys are in the drawer. Y'know what? I also need some cash.
No honey, it's okay! Listen, I'll got to Ross's and get the blender, you get all the margarita stuff ready.
Alright, I'll give you the ear thing but don't you think the ending was pretty wonderful?
Oh yeah. You know, I don't know if I was happier when um George Bailey destroyed the family business or um, Donna Reid cried, or when the mean pharmacist made his ear bleed.
I'm gonna go into the bathroom so I can look at it in the mirror, as I eat it.
I'll help you dial.
Okay. Man, I have not made this many cookies since I was in the ninth grade.
Let's give it a shot.
Mhm, helpful brother - creepy loner at teen movie.
Mhm, packing - sexy cheerleader comedy.
Hello Dan! I'm really looking forward to Saturday night! Really, really!
Nice to meet you.
Hello! Were we at the same table? It's like... cocktails in Appalachia.
What?
Rachel-Rachel-Rachel I-I cannot, I can't let-, actually I kinda want to see what happens.
No-n-n-n-no! I am finally thinking clearly. My lucky dress wasn't working out to well for me, but for four years, this baby never missed.
Al-alright, l-look you guys, this is the best relationship I've been in. . .
She's not a twinkie.
Honey, you've been really strong about this, I know how badly you wanted that job.
Oh yeah, it's a good idea!
: OK... Dear Ms. Green... yeah... yeah... yeah... No.
: We have apple cinnamon...
Yeah, a-a-and clean. Not just health department clean... Monica clean.
Oh, that's great.
What the... Yes you're too late! Where was all this three years ago?!
I know this is crazy but am I too late?
Ok..You know the old classics you know,You look nice? They're still ok.
No no! I just love the way you look, I am warm, for your form.
Phoebe, he's a friend of my parents. He's like 20 years older than me.
So. You two are totally into each other.
I don't understand, I mean am I so hard to live, is this why I don't have a boyfriend?
Right.
No, no, wait. His flight doesn't leave for another forty-five more minutes.
The country.
Okay, but there is a wire back there! I mean that switch is connected to something!
Oh my God! Look at this!
Oh, we were playing "peek-a-boo." She just - she loves it when I'm dramatic.
What? What do you mean, "there you are"? Where was she?
You obviously haven't screwed over a lot of your friends. Which we all appreciate.
No. Is there anyway, anyway you think he'll understand this?
Chandler! Okay, let me get this straight, it's okay for you to flirt, but not for me.
See, I'm finding out all this stuff about you today, like you like the Law & Order and that you flirted with every guy in the Tri-State area!
Well, maybe she thought that with all of your history it could be, you know, implicit.
Unbelievable. She says goodbye to everyone but me.
First of all um, I love you both so much and you're both so important to me...
Me too!
Sandra, I am so sorry, I thought you were Rachel and we just weren't ready for you yet.
Well, my goodness, what was that?
Well, doing nothing on your thirtieth is better than doing something stupid, like Ross.
Nothing. I don't want to do anything.
I think his begging days are over now that he's going out with Nancy Branson.
Ugh! I cannot believe Chip dumped me for that slut Nancy Branson. I am never going out with him again. I don't care how much he begs!
That's a good idea! I bet they have one of those wind machines! Y'know...
Hey, why don't you guys go, get portraits done by a professional photographer.
I just-I can't believe that you think that you and Chandler know me and Rachel better than we know you.
I can check that for ya.
You're not dressed yet?! We're supposed to start having fun in 15 minutes!
Pheebs, I was wondering...
C'mon. Keeps his fingers to himself and he's always minty fresh.
I don't know.
I still say that if we had called your dad we coulda gotten better seats.
You're straight. I get it.
Nooo! No, that's not true. No, best time ever! Yeah, you rocked me world!
No. We were in the middle of sex...and you fell asleep.
Chinadolor Bong, come on, we steal that TV Guide every week!
What?!
Oh, wow, so you're gonna be one of those "healthy, healthy, healthy guys"?
You know those posters for the city free clinic?
Just go up to her and ask her out. Oh, what's the worst thing that could happen?
Ohh, she's pretty. Pretty ahh, pretty girl, the pretty--she's pretty.
They're in the kitchen getting something to eat. Can you believe how nice they are?
Where are Bill and Colleen?
This was fun! But I've got an invasive vaginal exam to get to!
What!?
So I don't have to sing and I can just sit there and pass judgments on others?
OK fine! Please come and support Mike. You don't have to sing.
I... I'm sorry, did you say something? I can't hear through all this damned hair!
He... he's gonna propose?
Mrs. Bing? Here, these are my parents umm, Judy and Jack Geller.
Oh honey! This is so exciting! I thought we screwed you up so bad this day would never come. Oh and just think. Soon there'll be lots of little Bings.
Oh, Rachel, sweetie, look, here's a really cute picture of Joey and you at the reception.
Pheebs! Always a pleasure.
Sorry. But I kind of have this feeling that we may have made a baby last night.
Here's an idea. You walk into a room...take a quick scan!
Oh my god! Did you hear that? She said Monica! Oooh, I can't leave her!
Yeah, okay.
Really? Cause I'd need like $500 for all the food and the supplies and stuff.
There you go, that's the spirit! Okay! Now, if you need money, I will lend you money, but just get moving!
Now see, this way you protect the plate.. and lets face it you have fun.
Hey. Amy. You've got to stop doing that. Monica about to have a heart attack: Okay, listen I know you're having a little bit of a family crisis, but you don't have to take it out on the plates. I mean, I mean in fact I think that everyone should cut their food like this.
See there you go. Woo! We're out of the woods. Okay, I'll get dressed now.
Definitely.
Well, I'm gonna fill in for him as food critic for the Chelsea Reporter.
Oh sure, Cilantro Larry.
Well, she was shocked when I told her, but then again so were most people.
Did she freak out?
Well, it was the first time. Y'know, there's not always a lot of agreement the first time.
It was fine, y'know? But she didn't agree with me as strongly as she agreed with Joey. She was more like, "I see you point, I'm all right with it."
Okay fine! Fine! Then you know what, I'll just write about Phyllis! Hmm!
Marcia and Chester.
Oh he's nice. He's nice! Y'know, you always stick up for the people we fog!
Dan just moved in downstairs. Yeah, he just got back from like this four-month trek in the Andes. Nice fella.
All right, y'know what? We really are late! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!!
This is my wedding.
Wait, no-no-no, I can go really fast! Dad, give me the keys to your Porsche!
Without my toe?! I need my toe!
Just breathe, breathe.. that's it. Just try to think of nice calm things...
Well, maybe that's my decision. Well, maybe I don't need your money. Wait!! Wait, I said maybe!!
Yeah, I've just been fiddling around in here making delicious treats for everyone.
Oh, yumm!
Okay, good, 'cause umm, well maybe we could have a little workout of our own...
Yeah.
All right. Tell me if this is too cute. Lesbian wedding, chicken breasts.
I'm uh, considering leaving your father.
What?! I didn't take care of everything, there's-there's plenty of things for you to do!
So wow, it looks like you took care of everything. Thanks a lot, co-host.
Oh yes, it is. I'm sorry I borrowed it, I was cold. I hope its okay?
Hey. That uh, that my sweatshirt?
Honey, you made the bed again. I told you, you don't have to do that. This isn't camp.
Well, I've never had it, I feel so left out. Oh look!
What? You freak! You wouldn't even have known about this place if it wasn't for me!
And now you'll see me buying it.
So look umm, while we're st-still in London, I mean, we can keep doing it right?
Bad London!
You, and you, you're supposed to be at my party. And Gunther! What are you doing here?
Could you guys please try to keep it down, we're trying to start a Boggle tournament.
I can't believe she's gonna say yes to David. She's clearly in love with Mike.
Ok, good night!
Yeah, and in the long version, I dump him for telling people the short version.
Well ah, the short version is, I ah pursued her for a couple of months, then I gave her a check for 20,000 dollars, and she was mine.
Oh hey Joey! We've been watching all day, when are you gonna be on TV?
Hey Mon!
Yeah with Chandler not getting paid, we could really use 300 million dollars.
Uh!
Yeah. All right, I'm gonna go tell Dan that it's not gonna happen. Don't do the dance.
Y'know, I sensed that I should stop. So we're okay?
Ok worse case scenario is...we borrow some money from my parents.
You know what? You know what? I think we're making too big a deal out of this. ok? So we pay our bills a little late this month and maybe next month we cut back on a few things. And maybe we start eating out of Joey's refrigerator for a change. You're chef... what can you make out of backing soda and beer?
Oh wait, just one more thing! One more minute! Umm, you're a stupid bitch.
Okay.
Okay, umm-umm, I'll just--I'll be right back, I just gotta go ah, go ah...
I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name. Paul, was it?
Phoebe knows and she's just trying to freak us out! That's the only explanation for it!
Are you serious?
Hi, come in! Paul, this is.. ... everybody, everybody, this is Paul.
What does that mean? Does he sell it, drink it, or just complain a lot?
Look, if you want you can keep it at our place until you find out what to do with it.
Well, they said would but they would only give me store credit. I mean, what am I going to do, get a thousand regular cats?
That's Mindy? Wow, she is pretty. Lucky. To have had a friend like you.
Mindy, my maid of. Oh!
We are the hottest! Huh? No one is hotter than we are! You're the best.
That was amazing.
I know being spit on is probably not what you need right now. Um... how long?
It's okay...
But Phoebe, you can go out with a creepy guy any night of the year. I know I do.
'Cause he was creepy, and mean, and a little frightening... alright, still, it's nice to have a date on Valentine's Day!
Yeah. I mean it was kinda fun for a while, but didn't you start feeling silly?
I hate my regular clothes now! Y'know? I look down and-and I know that this isn't gonna be the most special day of my life.
Olivia? I thought she was marrying Connor! Oh right, real life more important.
Olivia.
Yeah that, plus his mom used to put sour cream on everything!
Is that why in junior high you were the only one that hung out with that Ukrainian kid?
Really? Okay, so why don't you tell me what happened to Ross Junior year at Disneyland?
No I'm serious, we should tell each other everything. I do not have any secrets from you.
Don't worry Joe, I won't come next year! Joey: What have you got there?
Monica!
All right fine, your guy may have a great body, but our guy is really funny.
I know.
What Phoebe meant to say was umm, how come you're having a party and we're not invited?
Hormones!
It was okay. She's still kind of depressed because she broke up with her boyfriend.
Hey, how was your breakfast with Hillary?
Chandler there's nothing wrong with crying! I mean you don't have to be so macho all the time.
Yes it was very sad when the guy stopped drawing the deer!
No, Phoebe, I'll tell you what, if you get ready now I'll let you play it at the wedding.
I'm sorry, but I just wrote the best dance song for your wedding. Check this out.
No I'm not sure that it's the best way to hear everything. Someone get me a glass!
Yeah, you're right. This is none of our business.
Yeah I can! And don't think I don't, because I do! I mean all the time, you betcha!
Oh, it's so easy for you I mean, you're not married, you get to have sex with who ever you want!
Okay, we have a lot of options here, a number of prototypes for you to try on.
Yes! And please tell her to bring a cake!
No Chandler no! No unscheduled stops. You can go when we stop for gas.
Please!
I can't believe we've never done this before! It's sooo good! So good for Monica!
And, I want you to remember that I gave you twenty seven dollars. No strings attached. Now, if you can't remember that, I think we should write it down-let's write it down!
This is me in The Sound of Music. See the von Trapp kids?
We have got to start locking that door!
Rachel, say that I'm friends with her, we spend some time together. Is that so terrible?
Oh, I'm sorry, did my back hurt your knife?
Doesn't it ever just freak you out that-that you're never gonna be with anybody new again?
Kinda. They're really big.
Oh, honey!I can't. I was just telling these guys that things are crazy at the restaurant!
So, what do you say? Can you get out of work?
Okay, now that everything's wrapped up here, I think I'm, I'm gonna go do my laundry.
Maybe I should get another pair! Ooh, y'know, they-they had some with fringe all down the sides. I'm gonna go kiss Ben goodnight. I can't believe he thinks I'm a cowboy. I would make a good cowboy.
Guys! Guys! I just saw two people having sex in a car right outside.
Yeah, her first day on a new spiritual plane and she's gonna come to the coffeehouse!
That's okay, this is more important than fruit on my ceiling! You broke up?!
God, Monica it's on the ceiling.
Yeah, you really shouldn't. By the way, how was that year-long dig in Cairo?
Joey, you shouldn't lie on your resume.
Is it like for dinosaur emergencies. 'Help, come quick, they're still extinct.'
What the hell does a paleontologist need a beeper for?
Oh gosh, listen if you and Chip do it tonight, promise me you'll tell me everything.
I know!
I don't know how museums work in England but, here, you're not supposed to take stuff.
They were so ornate and beautiful, I mean look at that!
You can't fire me. I make your decisions and I say, "I'm not fired!" Ha!
Well, y'know what, no, you do not make my decisions because y'know what, you're fired.
Yes, because all good plans start with, "I'll go down the fire escape."
All right. I've got a plan. I'll go down the fire escape.
No, of course not. It's not even an issue. Cause I told him I was 22.
Whoa! And this manchild has no problem with how old you are?
He's got something plastic lodged in his throat, we've got to go to the hospital.
But you-you can't leave me with them! We-we're a team! We're playing a zone! They're gonna triple team me!
Oh, absolutely. Yeah, you know I'm not even thinking about that thing that we're not supposed to think about.
Oh, that's why you never see pigeons at sushi bars. See, we're having fun.
Yeah. I bet you can't guess what color my tonsils are? I'll bet the apartment!
What?
Remember that guy from cooking school I told you about that put cilantro with everything?
Oh yeah, I definitely know her.
Hey. Ross, did you know Mom and Dad are going to Puerto Rico for Thanksgiving?
Ok, ok, that's fine. Fine. Hey, I'm sorry about that spill before. Only $98.50 to go.
Jean-Claude Van Damme. I didn't know he was in this movie, he is so hot.
What what what what?
Well maybe we can make a, a, a 'B' out of one of those roses.
"Happy Birthday Peehe."
Yeah you will! The right guy is just around the corner! Okay, are we done with that?
Umm... I'm never gonna getting married!
Ok who thinks the food is delicious and a little pretention never hurt anyone?
Ok, well, who identified the tone of this restaurant as pretentious comma garlicky?
Ross let me ask you a question. All jokes aside, where is this relationship going?
I'm sorry, it's just one of my last nights together before she leaves for camp-to be a counselor!
Oh. I guess you can. Okay but; I-I have to return it, so you can't like it.
Well then why can't I see it?
It's supposed to be that small. It's a pre-appetizer. The French call it an amouz-bouche.
Ooh, you know, I had a grape about five hours ago, so I'd better split this with you.
Well, I-I-there was this guy at the bank that I thought was cute umm, but I don't anymore.
Nothing! You go!
That would be a terrible punishment. But, I'm serious, I've never seen these before.
Oh yeah, right! Good luck getting another scarf dance from me!
Wow! That Mike thing was interesting! I don't know what's gonna happen with Phoebe and David.
I wasn't gonna swim, I was gonna dig a hole!
A salad? Really I, I could do something a little more complicated if you like.
Alright, lets see if you're as good in person as you are on paper. Make me a salad.
Oh, really? So why was I busting my ass to make this delicious Thanksgiving dinner?
Hey, we all had better plans. This was nobody's first choice.
Look, I know that I should've told them. I know I shouldn't care what they think. I'm sorry.
Is this why they don't like me or why you don't like me?
Wow! That's great! Dad must really like you, he doesn't ask just anyone to play.
My dad wanted to know if you wanted to play racquetball with us.
This is crazy! I mean, it's such a stupid argument. I don't even wanna see Richard again.
Y'know Monica you had a minor setback in your relationship with Chandler. Big deal! It's only Chandler. I am so sorry.
Wait a minute. Are you honestly telling me that-that you may never want to get married?
If marriage worked, I'd be all for it. But do you know what the divorce rate in this country is? 97%.
What do you want me to do? Just sit here silently while you three have a conversation?
Yeah but, Mischa is so interested in you, that Sergei and I haven't been able to say two words to each other.
Well, you broke up with Julie Grath! How much weight could she have gained?
What?!
I think so. Se, he-he's not inviting you to his party because he likes you.
No, there's a party. There's a party. But the power, that is still up for grabs. You follow me?
Hold it! Are you talking about Dick Clark's New Year's Rocking Eve?
I just got a call to be a dancer on a television special for New Year's Eve. It's called some sort of Dick'n Rock'n Dickie Eve.
Because, you were mean to me and you, you teased me and you always, always got your way.
Why did you hate me?
Cowboy boots? I've never worn cowboy boots in my whole life!
Yeah, oh, but I just keep picturing you rolling around with him with your cowboy boots in the air...
Chandler, umm, I want you to take just a minute and I want you to think about how ridiculous this sounds.
No, the best reason to get married is pregnancy. Sorry is pretty much fourth y'know, behind being ready and actually wanting to get married. Will you be my wife?
He had to go, there's a deer just outside eating fruit from the orchard.
I've gotta go, there's a deer just outside eating fruit from the orchard!
I know. I just wish that once, I'd bring a guy home that they actually liked.
Listen. As someone who's seen more than her fair share of bad beef, I'll tell you: that is not such a terrible thing. I mean, they're your friends, they're just looking out after you.
I love you. Oh, wait, wait, wait! No hugs. The dresses... Oh what the hell.
Oh, thank you.
You know, I knew a girl in high school who did that. She was very popular.
Yeah, yeah, I'm going to be out there spreading joy to the people. I mean, last year, I spread a little joy but not really enough. So this year, I'm going to do the whole city.
The babies are asleep, I'm sure you'll be okay on your own for a while!
What?! No, you can't, you can't leave me here with them! We're baby-sitting!
But still, it's a big change. The end of an era, you might say!
Mon, honey you're not dying. I'm just moving out. Y'know, I mean we're gonna see each other all the time.
Yeah. Hey, that was nice of you guys to back off and let Joey get the girl for once.
Looks like Joey is doing allright with her.
Wait. Rachel, no, he's married. Married! If you don't realize that, I can't help you.
Whoa, wait, listen, I think I'm just gonna talk to Ross about what he think it meant.
Chandler, please! Do you know how unbelievably glad I am that Joey was not there that night?!
I don't believe it. The most romantic night of my life and I'm runner up.
No-no, I-I just, I liked them so much that I went out and bought some for myself.
Did-did you take these back?
Okay, ooh, alright. Name, address... Okay, in case of emergency, call?
Ow ow ow. Ow ow ow. Ow ow ow.
Honey, having a heart attack is nature's way of telling you to slow it down.
Most people don't like their jobs, I love my job! I have not been working for three hours and I'm already going crazy. I miss Joan.
Daddy! I don't think we need to hear about the specific positions you and mom had sex.
This one time I had my knee up on the sink and your mother, she was.
Yeah, but we haven't heard a thing from the adoption agency and it has been weeks!
Somebody is gonna pick us.
Well uh, you and I are just goofing around, I thought, why not goof around with him.
So, are you really gonna go out with that nurse man?
I'm not sick!! I don't get sick! Getting sick is for weaklings and for pansies!
I'm so sorry you're sick.
Ok, I don't wanna be negative so I'll say that most of the signs you bought are good.
This isn't the right room, sorry folks.
I said we are not going to do it, okay? Sometimes you can be such a, a big baby.
Willya relax? Look around. No pagan altars, no piles of bones in the corners, they're fine. Go like this.
Hey Gunther. Hi. I mean you're going out on a date with the noisy guy upstairs?
Hey guys.
I can't believe Joey's having lunch with his stalker. What i-, what is she like.
I know.
: maybe I will go yea will have a second honeymoon at the Tulsa romana.
oh why don't you fly out there and surprise him.
Yeah, sure... uhm, I'm devastated, obviously... Did you think the neighborhood was homey?
Monica, you understand what we are saying, right?
What is it with you people! I mean, the minute you start to feel something, you have to run away?
Men are unbelievable.
Wait a minute, are you doing Joey's "Audition didn't go so well. Yeah it did?"
Not so good.
Wow, you seem to be doing so much better. That's great. So how-how are things going?
Anyway, I just wanted to say thank you, it was just, it was so sweet.
Of course I have! What do you think, I'm some 30 year old virgin?
Monica. You've, you've done it right?
All right, you just make sure that Chandler catches the ball, I'll take care of the rest.
What are you gonna do?
Wow, really? One time he just looked at my bra and it popped open.
Well, it wasn't just me, alright? He freaked out too! He couldn't even undo my bra!
Oh because it doesn't...really fit. Oh by the way, I-I booked the Swing Kings.
Yeah, that's like the most ugliest dress I've ever seen. Wh-why do you to return it?
Oh, Chandler, that's sweet. But you don't have to do everything Doctor Phil tells you to do.
You know, you always cook this meal all by yourself. Let me help this year.
I'm sorry, okay? It just-tonight was supposed to be y'know, it was supposed to be a big deal.
Okay.
No you're not. You're, you're allergic to lobster and peanuts and--oh my god.
And that's what's gonna kill me. I'm allergic to kiwi.
Well that's it. People never say `We need to talk' unless it's something bad.
And?
Joey, I left my watch on the counter last night. It was right here, where is it?
Hi!
Phoebe, you got Joey drums to annoy Rachel, so she wouldn't wanna live there anymore?
Yes, thank you. You see, this is how normal people are supposed to react to drums.
Honey. Uh, not to sound too Florence Henderson but, dinner's on the table.
Nice moustache by the way. When puberty hits that thing's really gonna kick in.
I don't know! Why don't you just explain? What do they want? Find out what they want!
Oh god, waddawe do, waddawe do, waddawe do?
Then you'd be going back and forth all the time, I mean it doesn't make any sense.
Well, what if all my stuff was here?
That's right. My Mom doesn't have any faith in me! Oh, that's hilarious! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.
Oh honey, come on, have a sense of humour, you've never been able to laugh at yourself.
Ha,ha, ha, oh my life is just so amusing. Could we drop it now?
Oh, yeah.
You're so pathetic! Why can't you just accept it, we're winning because I'm better than you.
It's no surprise that your winning, 'cause you got to pick first, so you got the better team.
No! But, I'm throwing this shirt away! I think there was a little misunderstanding before.
Are you pregnant?!
Thank you! 2nd Customer: It was. The duck in particular was superb.
Everything was delicious!
Yeah, I'll be fine. You know, maybe I'll stay here and practice the art of seduction.
Really? You're gonna be okay?
Some people have been saying its y'know little drops of heaven, but whatever.
I told 'em your candy is absolutely indescribable!
Ooh! But the band and the photographer are coming all the way in from New Jersey!
The blizzard. I just saw on the news, it's like the worst snow storm in 20 years! They already closed all the bridges and tunnels.
Ah, it's an honest mistake. It could happen to anyone. All right, see ya.
Yeah, right Monica. I'm so sorry.
That is so sweet. I know that I was acting a little crazy but umm, I feel the same way.
Yeah! I've never been in a relationship that's lasted this long before. Y'know to get past the beginning and still be around each other all the time, I think that's pretty incredible. And the fact that this is happening all with you, yeah I think that's pretty exciting.
It's just that he doesn't have that much free time, ya know, and I don't know, what do I do?
Sure.
Wait, you can't have the baby here! I mean I haven't sterilised it since the guys moved out!
Yeah, I thought I had one a couple of minutes ago, and now I know that was definitely one.
Does it have to do with-with Chandler and that sock that he keeps by his bed?
No.
Wait, was this a-a small mediterranean guy with curiously intelligent good looks?
Yeah. This one goes across the street, I must have given him yours. Oh, bonehead, bonehead!
Hey, guess what I'm doing this weekend! I'm going to this culinary fair in New Jersey.
Wait! What about Joey?
Rachel, what's going on? I mean isn't this the same Barry who you left at the altar?
That's, that's nice twice!
Thank you so much for seeing us. Phoebe has told us such great things about you guys.
What?! You can't separate them! That's terrible. Which one?
What? So you guys don't mind going out with someone else who's going out with someone else?
No, of course not! ...Yeah, yeah, it is.
Phoebe! But I could take one of those little feet and put it in a pita pocket.
She's just so cute! I just wanna bite her ear off and use it and a sucking candy.
I'm so sorry that you had to find out this way. I'm sorry, but it's true, I love him too.
Look, we're not just messing around! I love her. Okay, I'm in love with her.
Wait. Rachel, no, he's married. Married! If you don't realise that, I can't help you.
Whoa, wait, listen, I think I'm just gonna talk to Ross about what he think it meant.
Thank you. So what does this Bob guy look like? Is he tall? Short?
There you go.
...And then we throw your body in the water... Gee, that does sound fun.
C'mon, you'll make a day of it! You'll rent a boat, pack a lunch...
Y'know what, I think we should play a game. I mean come on, it's been twelve years.
Anyway. That's when our Mom said we were not to play football ever again.
Oh my God, can you believe we are surrounded by all this? I can barely control myself.
Hey!
You heard the woman. Peel, chop, devil! I can't believe I lost 2 minutes.
We're back on.
Alright, I tell you what, I'll give this to you now if you can tell me where we keep the dustpan.
Ok, ok, ok, I will, I will, I, hey, I will clean the apartment for two months.
Well, no, not at all, you're not terminal, you just, you just need some damage control.
So, you don't think I'm terminal?
So do you guys gonna come over tomorrow? I'll make that pasta thing I was telling you about.
And Chandler I can't believe I let you pay for this one. Thanks man.
Hey, look at me. I'm making jam, been at it since 4 o'clock this morning.
See Joe, that's why your parents told you not to jump on the bed.
With a wok? I thought you were going to read my boring book to put you asleep.
Shhhhhhhhh!!! I'm sorry, I thought maybe I'd make some warm milk and it would help me sleep.
Why would I care where Chandler is? You know uhh...You know sometimes I don't even like Chandler.
Pisst, Monica. Alright, we really need to start looking out for Rachel. I'll cover the front door. You watch that big hole at the back of the building and I got Chandler covering Ross.
So! So we've got to go upstairs and have a lot of sex to prove them wrong!
Ohh, so?
Okay. That's okay. I-I know that you're very upset right now. I know, I know that wasn't about me.
Oh my God!
Here's your key. All right, you have to christen it! Now, go out and come back in!
Oh thanks.
Are you insane? I mean Joey, is going to kill you, he's actually going to kill you dead.
You see what men do! Don't tell me men are not nice! This is men!!
Well, because every time we do, you make jokes about swinging and scare them away.
Yeah, I don't know why we hang out with married couples more often.
Oh, the way you crushed Mike at ping pong was such a turn-on.You wanna...?
What? Homo ergaster: Some scientists classify some African erectus specimens as belonging to a separate species, Homo ergaster, which differs from the Asian H. erectus fossils in some details of the skull .
He's not great umm, but he's dealing with it. Oh wait a minute, you're not gonna try...
How's Ross doing? Y'know since all the Emily stuff.
What's the big deal with her? Maybe she's attractive in an obvious kind of way.
I wasn't staring. I was leering.
He wanted to tell me he's gonna compete is some ultimate fighting competition thingy.
Well then definately don't take his name.
My God, Rachel, I can't believe Phoebe made out with Ralph Lauren. Ohh, I'm so jealous.
I am proud of all my friends today.
Really? I'm perfectly comfortable. Hey, hey, hey, get in line buddy, I was next.
Monica, Monica, your guest are turning into jerky, OK.
I can't get married until I get something old, something new, something borrowed, and something blue.
Right!
Oh, I'm glad. Listen, I want to apologize about Chandler, though. I just did not see this coming.
Thanks so much for taking me to all those places. I had a great time.
Oh yeah? Well when you learned how to dance did you forget how to put on underpants?
We learned how to dance.
All right people listen, I've got exactly twenty-eight minutes before I have to baste again.
Okay. All right. So let's see, let's play from the trash can, to the lightpost. Right. Two hand touch, we'll kick off.
Yeah, I talked to you on the phone, I'm the lady that got stuck with the racecar bed.
Uh, may I help you?
Well uh, I'm trying to make something for Joey. Do you mind if I raid your fridge?
Hey! What's up Mon?
Ok, um so, I still have to invite Dillon and Emma and Shannon Cooper.
I talked to Rachel's sisters, neither of them can come.
Oh, I've got it! I have got it! Pictures from your childhood. This will get you going good!
Cry?! I just found a talking puppy, I'm rich!
I would love too, but I can't! I mean I just can't, you know that I'm not good at confrontation.
Well, wait a minute, you're the boss! Why don't you just yell at them? Or, fire them?
We were, we were just in the storage area and we saw this really creepy man!
You guys! You guys!
Well, honey, it is pretty competitive. I mean I've got an actual rocket scientist here.
Noooo, that's what I was wearing when I donated. I'm kinda surprised there's any of my boys left.
Whatever Ross! Just replace the bulbs in the brake lights after you're done.
It's a car Monica! Not a rocket ship!
That's what it says here. Flight 421, leaves at 8:40, Newark airport.
Yes, that's what I have. It's not on the board.
Y'know, I don't have an appointment, but I sure could use a physical. Are you sure you're okay?
I bet he can.
Joey is having a secret Days Of Our Lives party up on the roof!
Wh-what's going on?
Y'know what, this is obviously some kind of twisted joke she's trying to play on him.
Ugh!
Joey, what are you doing? You promised Phoebe you wouldn't eat meat until she has the babies!
The next tour of the wine cellar will plan in two in-in minutes...
Yeah, but the important thing to know about us, is how much we would care for this little baby.
Well, our names really are Monica and Chandler. We're from New York.
Oh man! If I had known I was coming to this party I never would have gotten married!
Ok actually Mon, Matthew was just giving me his phone number.
Wow, come in, have a seat. You must be exhausted coming all the way from...Texas.
Santa was unavailable so close to Christmas.
Alright, before I tell you, uh, why don't you tell me how many women you've been with.
Night Richard. Good luck Mon.
Well, are you asleep right now, Joe? 'Cause I don't think you have to wear it unless you are!
Oh, they gave it to me at the sleep clinic, and it's gonna help me not to snore.
Yeah, y'know I-I made a commitment to you. Y'know what, it'd be, it'd be fun.
Really?! Are you sure?
My brother, the PhD would like to know if there's any way to treat this orally.
Did you tell him about my thquirt gun idea?
See? Ben doesn't think you're a loser, he thinks you're a cowboy! Now that's something.
Oh, be-because of the leather pants.
I know what you need, you need a bodyguard. Hey Ross, what is Ben doing after preschool?
Hey, it's a lot harder than it looks! Okay? She-she-she's hurting me.
No. Big deal, so you have a side of the bed, everybody has a side of the bed.
Or so I would have you believe.
Well uh, you and I are just goofing around, I thought, why not just goof around with him.
So, are you really gonna go out with that nurse man?
How about if I dance around all covered in sauce? Huh? You think it's funny now?
No.
Y'know if it's any consolation, he really did sound like he was having more fun with you.
Honey, I'm sorry.
Did you like her? And I'm just asking as a friend, because I am totally fine with this.
Oh, that was the blind date that I told you about, she called and switched it to today.
Okay. I'm guessing that if you don't want to deliver, you probably don't want to pick stuff up either.
No.
I-It's just so insulting! Big spring for a new blank tape, Doctor!
Is that a problem?
Oh Joey, look, we know you're having a hard time with this, but we really, we love it here.
Maybe. Well, I just think you guys can do better than this house, you know? Or any other house for that matter.
I know, but now we have this second one and it just, it feels like it's snowballing, y'know?
But we've only had one job.
No, I know. But y'know what? It would make me feel better if Lewis apologized to me.
What? Are you kidding? That was like 16 years ago.
Ugh, y'know, umm we gotta get up early and catch that plane for New York.
Actually, do you guys mind staying here for a while?
This is a garden view room, and we paid for an ocean view room.
What? Why?
Oh no it's not, no it's not. It's a first date. I'm sure that nothing is gonna...
Oh, this is just terrible.
Phoebe! I have to have those earrings, we're going to leave as soon as the show is over.
Doesn't know, "Hello." But she knows Capricorn One.
Can I ask you guys a question? D'you ever think that Alan is maybe.. sometimes..
Yep, we sure showed those Hassidic jewellers a thing or two about softball..
Okay, so it doesn't involve Ross or Rachel or Chandler or Joey. But, what about Pete?
No.
Well, if you had kept listening, you-you would have heard me call him Mr. Big......ot.
Well, I wouldn't know because I got so freaked out that I hung up the phone.
Because, honey, I mean this in the sweetest way possible, nobody is gonna wanna watch that.
I have a weird feeling about this place. How do I know that they are not gonna secretly videotape me and put it all over the internet.
Wait-wait, guys! If-if we follow the rules, it's still fun and it means something!
Fun's over!
Well you let me know if you can, because y'know I can bake a pie to cover it.
What the smell from Joey's? No, I can hardly smell it over here.
Man, man that is sharp. It must have cost you quite a few debloons.
No no, no no, it's not flashy, not for a Goodfella.
Well, I did one time, and-and I want to start doing it more. See that's what this is about.
Not really.
Oh, that's Nana, right there in the middle. 'Me and the gang at Java Joe's'.
Got me.
Um, you guys, you know when I said before, "thank you, but I don't really need your help"?
No, that was his costume. See, he's actually an orthodontist, but he came as a regular dentist.
Listen, we don't have to make that a guest room, we can think of something to do with the room together.
Ohh.
All right ah, Ross, this is the extent of my knowledge on the subject. Call Rachel.
Oh what?! Is she gonna cancel on me again?! How can she do this? Doesn't she know it's our anniversary?
Okay, listen, there's still some of Chandler's medicine under the sink in the bathroom. Bye!
Look, uh, just come later, we'll get everything squared away and you can come back later.
Ross, come sign this birthday card for dad. Rich is gonna be here any minute.
No, sorry I don't. Tell me why would anyone pay someone to scar their body for life? What if it doesn't come out right Phoebe? Then it's like, I don't know, havin' a bad hair cut all the time. Why's everyone staring at me?
I'm on top of the world, looking down on creation and the only explanation I can find...
What? Ow!
: what's the big deal, you forgot, she forgot, maybe you were having an off night.
and who's fault is that.
If someone wants to give us a present, we don't want to deprive them of that joy.
That's okay Pheebs, we're not having a party or anything, so you don't have to get us...
Yeah... ..see, I was supposed to get married, but, um, I left the guy at the altar.
Thanks! I've been here about six years, and Rachel moved in a few months ago.
I know, I've been looking at those doors, they look pretty sound proof, don't you think?
We have to leave for New York in an hour.
I can't do it. I'm sorry, I wish I could, but umm, see you have these feelings for me....
Oh no, not the thing. I hate the thing. What's the thing?
I don't know, maybe. I mean I'm dating a man who's pool I once peed in.
Yeah. Are we nuts here?
Hey! Oh, I'm so glad you're home, I thought tonight we could finally organize these photos!
Hey!
No, there is no way! It can not be Ross! Unbelievable! Why is your family Scottish?!
Yes!!
You know, that's true. You'd be a great person to have around the day after an emergency.
My diary! My diary, that's brilliant. I should have told her it was my diary, she never would have made me read her my diary.
Could you guys please try to keep it down, we're trying to start a Boggle tournament.
Everything you've heard is true.
No, I want you to have a job that you love. Not statistical analysis and data reconfiguration.
Yeah, me too. Look, I'll just get my old job back.
Ok, let's see... uhm, okay, the turkey is in the oven, the stuffing is ready...
"The Firm"?
No. Um, I know you like this, and I want you to have it. I think it'll look good in our apartment.
What you got there? Something else that's not yours that you can break?
My Sweet Sixteen! Remember, you went to third base with my cousin Charlie.
Monica, what are you talking about?
Oh-ho! But not in here! Can't eat 'em in bed, remember? No crumbies!
Okay.
Well that's because you always sleep to noon, silly! This is what 9 looks like.
But it's dark out.
Hey, don't say that! You got just as good a chance as anybody else of getting that job!
Well no, Charlie's gonna get that.
Oh, I'm sorry. Of course I mean that. Interesting idea, umm, talk about it, but no.
Okay so you mean no as in, "Gee Chandler, what an interesting idea. Let's discuss it before we reject it completely."
Hey Ross, maybe if your skin was lighter. Your teeth wouldn't look so bright.
I don't know what I'm going to do. That date starts in like an hour.
We got out pictures back from London. Here's all of us at the Tower of London.
Hey, Pheebs!
But the minute we start to lie to each other... And by 'we' I mean society.
Well, maybe he just didn't want to hurt your feelings.
I don't, I just, I just like the smell of them. So, uh, what are you really doing here Dad?
Well, it's your mother's bridge night so I thought that I would come into the city for a little Monicuddle. Since when did you start smoking cigars?
Oh my God! Ross, you wouldn't believe the cute little noises the twins are making. Listen.
What? Hey, hey, listen..
Let's just do it right now. Okay? It won't be hard. Just say what's in your heart.
Do you happen to know what I'm going to say?
So you're a little older. Try to look at the positive: You have all this life experience.
I am so much older than these other interns. I can't compete with them.
Oh my God! We love that show! I mean Ross and I have been watching it since I can remember!
Yeah, that's what I said.
Okay, fine I admit it! I feel terrible! Would you please rub this on my chest?
Really? Struck down in the pribe of libe!
Oh, that's great! I mean I'm-I'm sorry, but I'm so happy for you. And now I can work for you!
Her name's Ann, she's a journalist. Ahh, we met on the plane. She asked me if she could finish off my peanuts, I thought she said something else, we had a big laugh. Yeah, I just, I mean I got, I got tired of waiting.
So how does this work, you going to balance the plates on these little guys' heads?
I know!
Mom and dad just sent me in here to find out if you were trying to get Ross stoned!
I don't know, I-I was all high.
Wait a minute. That wasn't a hard eight! Last night I rolled a hard eight.
That was so unlikely. Well, let's get married! I guess.
No! Wait! If anybody gets to go.. it's us We've been complaining the longest!
Well, if you're leaving, I'm definitely gonna go.
It's almost 8 o'clock, it's almost past his bedtime. Where-where is he?
Because, because I've got Ben.
Get all freaked out because everybody was talking and just joking around about marriage and stuff.
What?!
Oh. Thank you. Ohhh, thank you very much. Oh, thank you for coming. Uh, just a second!
Does she use the cups? Yes! I believe she does. Does she use the plates? Yes! I believe she does.
My brother's going through that right now, he's such a mess. How did you get through it?
I know, I know, I'm such an idiot. I guess I should have caught on when she started going to the dentist four and five times a week. I mean, how clean can teeth get?
Guys, could you please just stop throwing the ball for one minute and just help me find it!
How do you know? You don't have a watch.
So how you doing today? Did you sleep okay? Talk to Barry? I can't stop smiling.
You should both know, that he's a dead man. Oh, Chandler?
They love each other, and they wanna celebrate that love with the people that are close with them.
I am really not going. I don't get it. They already live together, why do they need to get married?
Maybe because it's you hung your head out of the window like a dog the whole ride here.
Okay. Then I guess I have dry eyes and a scratchy throat for no reason.
Okay, he's a lawyer, who teaches sculpting on the side. And- he can dance!
Yeah, but did you see the dents in his knuckles? That means he's artistic.
Well, an-anyway, I just-that night meant a lot to me, I guess I'm just trying to say thanks.
Right.
Okay, I've got a question. If you had to pick one of us to date, who would it be?
You see, now, I would date this girl. She's cute, she's outdoorsy, you know, and she knows how to build a fire. I mean, that's got to come in handy
I cant believe you. You still havent told that girl she doesnt have a job yet?
Yeah.
Wasn't it a lot more exciting when we were y'know all over each other all the time?
Oh wow! Is that what this all have been about?
Nope, sound like me. Pheebs, it's going great. Look at Chandler with little baby girl Chandler.
I'm doing okay. I think it's going well. Do you think they're having fun? Am I talking to fast?
It's a stupid game and I wasn't playing against other people, so technically I didn't lose.
Now, that's a lot harder than it sounds. You always forget at least one, or in some cases... fourteen .
Yeah-Oh that's right. You, you always wanted me too. Hey, I see you got your mustache back.
You too, you let uh, your hair grow long.
And say what? "You owe me a goodbye", I mean, he's got more pride than that.
Ross, if you're this upset, you should go and talk to her.
Is-is-is that message old or new? Old or new?! Old or new?!
"Monica, it's Richard. Call me."
This is for the scratchy twins out there. I taped oven mits to their hands.
Ooh, duct tape. Was I supposed to bring something too?
So big deal, so Joey's had a lot of girlfriends, it doesn't mean he's great in bed.
Yes, and I was saying the actual words.
Well, this is the last box of your clothes. I'm just gonna label it, "What were you thinking?"
Hey, I didn't make up the rules. Now, after you receive the doubling bonus, you get uh, one card. Now that one card could be worth $100 bringing your total to 1,500. Don't get to excited because that's not gonna happen unless you get-No way!
Do I go horseback riding in the park? Do I take classes at the New School?
Oh, it's so late for 'Shall we'...
The woman that got married a bunch of times and killed herself when you were 13?
Yes!
I can't wait to be with you! I'll just tell Rachel I'm gonna be doing laundry for a couple of hours.
All right! Man, this is unbelievable!
Well, if I had them taken out, then I wouldn't be able to do this. You like that, right?
So if you want people to see them, then by definition you're not having them taken out... say, at the break of dawn?
Am I doing here? Why? Surprised to see me? Ross brought me. How do you like that?!
Monica! What...
Hello! Organic substances recently discovered in the depths of the rain forest!
God. Do think it really doesn't hurt? 'Cause how can they do that?
That's weird. I've had the same number of beers as you and I don't feel anything at all.
I am sooo drunk.
I think it's a great idea. Yeah, we could have a dinner party and just invite her close friends.
Yeah but if we throw her a party on her birthday, then it's not a surprise.
Wow, for a guy who's recently lost his job, you're in an awfully good mood.
Fine, make fun. I think it's jaunty.
Okay. Okay, I got one. Do you remember that vegetarian pate that I made that you loved so much?
Whoah, boy, hockey was a big mistake! There was a whole bunch of stuff we could've done tonight!
Well Ross, you be careful now. You don't want to get a reputation as y'know Professor McNailshisstudents.
Well, not really. I mean technically it's-it's not against the rules or anything, but it is frowned upon. Especially by that professor we ran into last night, Judgey von Holierthanthou.
You're supposed to find your passion in life. You can be whatever you wanna be now. It's exciting.
I mean, what am I supposed to do with myself?
You do know that was me who just said that right? Hey. As long as we're both up...
Yeah! You?
Remember back in freshman year? Well, Billy Dreskin and I had sex on your bed.
Would you excuse me for a second?
Well, I'm sorry, but Chandler and I could really use a weekend away. You know, to reconnect... emotionally.
C'mon you guys, this is really important to us.
Alright, well, maybe I should let you and the second prettiest girl in Oklahoma get back to work.
Well, she... she didn't win...
Yes. Yes, I was. A guy. From work. I'm seeing a guy from work! Ha!
Since when do take naps in that position. Oh God Monica, tell me you were waiting for a guy! Please tell me you were waiting for a guy!
Hold on a second, just put a little club soda on it and it should umm, be.....
Yeah.
What you guys don't understand is, for us, kissing is as important as any part of it.
Okay, so, I'm in Las Vegas... I'm Liza Minelli-
Oh, you can have an accent and I can't?! Top 'O the morning to ya laddies!
Right, will you excuse us for one moment? What are you doing?
Yeah, well I might be if I had the supplies! I mean, I could do all this stuff. Only I don't.
You're not an artist.
Yeah but it was because I-I had an eye exam and I don't like my new eye doctor.
Oh really?
Look, I don't even know how I feel about him yet. Just give me a chance to figure that out.
What are you talking about? We love Schhteve! Schhteve was schhexy!.. Sorry.
Especially the after taste, you know, I'll tell ya, that'll last ya till Christmas.
Really?
Yeah, tacos! Ever since you told me that story I've had such a craving for them.
Oh yeah?
No! Everything's cold. The turkey's dried out and the... the stuffing is all soggy.
Alright, come on... Alright, you guys. We're so sorry we're late. Please let us in, so we can have dinner together.
Oh, he's sober alright. Just turns out that Fun Bobby was fun for a reason.
What, isn't he sober?
Um, okay, here it goes. I'm not 22. I'm, I'm 25... and thirteen months.
Oh.
Rachel, I have not missed one question the whole game. I own this game! Look at my hand.
Monica, betting the apartment, I don't know about this.
Y'know, in my defense, umm there was no glitter on the macaroni and very little glue.
I'm back baby! Ha-ha-ha!
Come on Chandler, come on, I can handle Ross. Hold on! Hey Ross. What's up bro?
Oh, I'm going on the lamb.
Sounds like you need to think about what you want, talk to Gavin, and you definitely should talk to Ross.
I don't know. It's so complicated. I work with this guy, you know, I have the baby, and I have Ross, and I just...I don'tknow what to do and I have to be at the office and see Gavin in ten minutes.
I just tell her, I have to get it over with. I told Ross and Phoebe and she's the only one left!
What gave me away?
Oh, I guess we could try that, but... it seems so harsh! Have you ever done that?
Cut her out of our lives! Just ignore her calls and dodge her 'till she gets the point!
Well, I was dancing around, and singing "No Woman, No Cry" and I got stuck.
Really? What happened?
Umm, when I said that uh, that Chandler and I wanted to umm, live together we meant alone together.
Um-hmm.
Okay, just wait, please. I promise we'll come up with something. Just give us a little more time.
Well, get ready to come out of the non-gay closet!
Why not! This is her wedding day, this is way more important than some stupid kids!
I don't think you can do that!
No, I don't even know how serious he is about me. Until I do, I'm not telling them anything.
No, I think you should tell them.
And for our two-week anniversary, he's gonna take me to his cousin's cabin for the weekend.
Half full of looooovvvvve.
I was just saying that because I was ovulating and you said you wouldn't have sex with me while we're fighting.
Leave it.
Come on. Hello? I'm sorry you have the wrong number. Okay, I'll call you later dad. I love you.
If that is your father calling to tell this story then the marriage is off!
Mom's here? I wanted to have lunch with her today, she told me she was out of town.
N-no, Emma dropped her sock.
Oh my God. You guys! You gotta come see this! There's some creep out there with a telescope!
I don't know, you don't wanna mess with corn nuts. They're craaazy.
Look, guys, you can't do this, it's just going to make getting over each other, that much harder.
Oh! Sorry, I guess I was thrown off by the mention of my name!
When I fall asleep on the couch after reading, she covers me over with a blanket.
That's nice. I like having things to read in the bathroom.
Come on Rach, come on. Let's see what's it like to be on a winning team for a change.
I can not believe your trading me!!
Rachel, you can go down there, you don't have to smoke. Just say you wanna get some fresh air.
I mean what if this keeps happening? Y'know, they'll-they'll be outside smoking, making all the decisions and I'll just be up in my office breathing my stupid clean air, y'know? And then when the day comes when Kim wants to promote one of us, who do you think she's gonna pick? Me or Smokey Smokerson?
Okay, those people just left, come on! Quick! Give him the money and get their table!
Mustached bastard...
Well, the turkey's burnt. Potatoes are ruined, potatoes are ruined, potatoes are ruined.
Ok, Monica, only dogs can hear you now, so, look, the door's open. Here we go.
I'm so sorry that you had to find out this way. I'm sorry, but iit-t's true, I love him too.
Look, we're not just messing around! I love her. Okay, I'm in love with her.
Honey, thanks for trying to figure out a way, but if you're going to Tulsa, I wanna go with you.
That's fast math! We could use you in Tulsa.
Well...honestly ever since we got engaged I have been waiting for something to, to flip you out.
What?
Yeah, but her plane got delayed in Athens. But actually, she should be here by now.
Isn't Rachel supposed to be back by now?
Phoebe and Rachel saw you with Nancy today and... em... they think you're having an affair.
Is it me, or have the greetings gone downhill around here?
Perhaps, you would like me to turn like this, so that you can bunny bump against my back.
Well, let's go to a bad one and make out.
We should get over there and see if she's okay. Just one...second! Score! Game! Come on.
I think she took it pretty well. You know Paolo's over there right now, so...
I can't believe it! She's asleep! I got her to go to sleep! I have actual magical powers!
You must be a fireball in bed.
Phoebe! You're sick, you shouldn't play. You should just go home, get in bed, and stay there.
Hey!
Yes it is. You see I've always found the men's bathroom very sexual. Haven't you?
Monica! This is the Men's room! Isn't it?
Chandler, you don't wanna miss this. This is the birth of your child! It's the miracle of life!
I'm okay.
Chandler, wait. It goes: Old job, new job, you. This is just something I have to do.
Okay, bye-bye! Good trip!
That's crazy! . I am sorry. I just can't imagine giving up my one wedding day like that!
No, no, no, we're not having a big reception, we took the money we were gonna spend on a wedding and we donate them to the children charity.
Hello...? Oh hi... Oh my God...! Really...? I can't wait to tell Chandler... Ok, goodbye.
No!
Because your all gonna make up fake specials and make me cook them like you did the other night?
Because we can remember them.
Oh, um, that was my bathing suit from high school. I was uh, a little bigger then.
Hey, Mon, what is this?
Well, at least you're not hearing it for the first time at your fifth grade Halloween party.
What a sweet story.
Ok! When I go places with high humidity, it gets a little extra body, ok?!
Alright, I don't wanna alarm anybody, but Monica's hair is twice as big as it was when we landed!
Okay, but all right you're a guy, does it not freak you that you're never gonna sleep with anybody else?
No. No, see when I first meet somebody it's uh it's mostly panic, anxiety, and a great deal of sweating.
Umm, why don't you give me something that would be a good reason and-and then I'll tell you if it's true.
What? What are you talking about?! You-you're the one who's been telling me to get over Ross and move on. I'm moving on, and you're moving on with me. Come on, give me one good reason why you don't wanna go.
Unless... Maybe we do it here. I mean, how much can she even be aware of at this age?
Sorry.
Oh come on, it's only fair, you paid for the flight. Now is, is that enough lire?
You're, hey, you're not paying for the pizza!
Oh, hi, Ross. Yeah. There's someone I want you to say hi to. He just happened to call.
This is so fun. This is like a reunion in the hall.
Hi sweetie, look before I forget, did I leave my diaphram at your place? Hi mom.
OK.
Y'know what we should do? We should all get dressed up and go to have champagne at The Plaza.
Yeah, you're on your own.
You're right. I mean I'm sorry. Yeah, I shouldn't be laughing. I should be laying down papers for you!
Look, okay-okay I had food poisoning! It's not like I choose to do it! It's not like-It's not like I said, "Umm, what would make this ride more fun?!"
Oh, I love this street. The trees, the big front yards, the actual picket fences.
Ross, you know what? Okay, let's talk about it later, there comes security.
Oh my God, that place has the creamiest frosting! I use to hitchhike there when I was a kid.
Oh, you're gonna love this cake. I got it from a bakery in New Jersey, Corino's.
Wow! Wow! And it's definitely all gone? There's nothing there to work with? What were you thinking?
That's right.
Honey, as we get closer to the wedding, is there anything that you would like to talk about or share?
Y-y-yeah! Yeah you do.
And Dad, y'know that mailman that you got fired? He didn't steal your Playboys! Ross did!
It was you?
So, do you guys wanna come and eat dinner at the restaurant sometime in the next few weeks?
Hi!
Now, most guys will hit uh, 1-2-3 and then go to 7 and set up camp.
Well, y'know, sometimes that helps.
: Is this not the good part? Do you want me to fast forward to something a little toothier.
Honey why am I watching a bunch of sharks swimming around.
Yeah but see I have nothing to compare it too. So even if you're horrible, how would I know?
Yeah! If-if-if we did do this there would be a lot of pressure on me, y'know? Because you've been waiting a very long time and I wouldn't want to disappoint you.
So I hide in the shower and the next thing you know they're going at it right on the bathroom floor.
And-and then I sneak out and before Monica can her parents come in.
How she drove you crazy, picking on every little detail, like your hair... for example.
Tell her what?
It was Laura... She gave us a great report and we are officially on the waiting list.
Wrong number?
Y'know what shoes would look great with this ring? Diamond shoes! You're not getting dressed.
I was afraid of that.
All right. But umm, I-I-I'll pay you back all the money you invested, and you can keep the van.
You're the cook! With out you it's just me driving up to people's houses with empty trays and asking for money!
No you didn't. Oh and honey just so you know, now that you're marrying me, you don't get to win anymore.
Y'know we already went over this and I won!
Hey, waitwait, aren't you the guy that plays the butt in the new Al Pacino movie?
Hey!
In one year?! My God what did she eat? Her-her family! That's not the point.
A hundred and forty-five pounds.
Wait a minute, you got Ross Gellar and guest?! I wasn't invited and you got "and guest?!"
Yeah, Joan Tedeski my date. She's an assistant professor in the Linguistics department. Tall, very beautiful, and despite what some people say, not broad backed!
They can't all be bad. Find the one where you make your bedroom eyes. Ohh, there it is.
I like this one. It seems to say, "I love you and that's why I have to kill you."
Ok. Great. I am so glad that you are here. We're really excited about getting this process started.
Oh, water would be fine.
It was, it was really nice. We started talking and I-I ended up having lunch with him.
Oh! Okay, that actually makes more sense. So how was it?
Thank you! You haven't said anything... 3rd Customer: Actually I do have one small complaint.
Thank you! 2nd Customer: It was. The duck in particular was superb.
I will! But not tonight. For dinner music, I thought we could listen to that tape you made me.
Look, you have done enough! Okay? You have to stop this now.
Oh my God. Wait a minute, I had them put... Oh my God! It's in the quiche! Oh My God!
Oh, no, I meant that it's weird that you only have nine now.
Oh umm, how about your mom dying, or having to live on the streets when you were 14?
So, I need to write some depressing stuff to go along with my new floozy voice, but nothing that sad has ever really happened to me.
We think if you saw it, you'd understand. I mean you guys were there. It is beautiful, isn't it?
You know that's not the reason Joe.
Yeah, well he's my brother! And plus he drives so slow he could never hurt it.
Wait a minute! You let Ross drive the Porsche and when I ask you, you say you're the only one who's allowed to drive it.
David, can you help me?! I'm trying to explain to Chandler how a plane stays in the air.
You don't own a TV? What's all your furniture pointed at??
Okay, I'll be back in just a minute. Oh, Phoebe I'm sorry that I left lipstick marks on the phone.
Cute naked guy is really starting to put on weight.
Ok, I'll tell you what. How about I cook dinner at my place? I'll make it just like Mom's.
Well, you were right. How can they do this to us, huh? It's Thanksgiving.
So uh, Joey and Chanlder, I, I think it's time that you take Dr. Greene over to your place.
Ok, now that your coat is safely in the bedr-, oh, ok we can come back out in the living room.
I can't believe you're dressing up for him. I mean, you're just, you're setting yourself up all over again.
No, no the gravel capades. Yeah, the turns aren't as fast but when Snoopy falls. . . funny.
All right! Let's go! Let's go Team Monica! All right, we can work out the name later.
I am!
They baked it. I can't take this anymore. I'm gonna call a meeting tonight, I'm gonna fire you tonight.
Hey, what happened to your fancy chef's jacket?
Okay, guys! The candy is coming; I just need another 15 minutes for the chocolate to cool!
Get in here! Hey, and you can not smoke in here! Merry Christmas.
We're supposed to uh, be spending a romantic weekend together, it-it, what is the matter with you?
Do not speak ill of the dead.
Wow, so you guys are, you're never gonna be in the same room together? How is that even gonna work?
Well look, I'm just trying to focus on the "I get to see my wife," part, all right? And not the part that makes me do this.
I don't believe this! When someone asks you in for lemonade, and to you that means they wanna have sex?
Oh right, right.
Oh, it was great! The widow wouldn't pay, so Phoebe yelled at her 'til she did.
Thank you! Hey, how'd the catering go?
2 minutes, 12 pies and a part of one tin! Okay, I see you guys at 4.
Did you at least win the contest?
So what! As long as he's not wearing a white dress and a veil I don't care.
Trust me, you don't want him there either. Okay? Nobody is gonna be staring at the bride when the father of the groom is wearing a back-less dress.
I hope you're hungry, we're starting with oysters. And y'know what they say about oysters, don't you?
Yeah, it sure is!
: Honey look we can do something else, do you want me to get into the tub and thrash.
does what always have to be sharks.
A Magic Eight ball?! You can't be serious, you can't make this decision with a toy!
Okay, that's it. I cannot make this decision! It is too difficult, so I'm just gonna leave it entirely to the gods of fate.
I think he is fine! It's just that we don't know anything real about him... we should get more information.
You don't like him.
Come on guys! Suck it up! We're closing in on ten hours! It's gut-check time!
I'm starving!
You know, they're not actually supposed to have... I'll work on the lumps. Joey, you're going home, right?
Will you make the mashed potatoes with the lumps?
Are you kidding?! I get a Porsche and the barca lounger's gone?! This is the best day ever!
Oh yeah, Joey broke it. Had to get rid of it.
Oh, what about that guy over there? Remember? That is the guy you flirted with at the counter that time.
Yeah, I guess Gunther is kinda...
Now I'm guessing that he bought her the big pipe organ, and she's really not happy about it.
Ooh, I was kinda hoping that wouldn't be an issue...
Oh absolutely. I like it even more on you than I did on Colonel Sanders. Ross! Ross! I'm kidding!
You like it right?
Umhmm, umhmm, about the time you told me about New Year's Eve. Where is everybody else?
It is. Did I... not tell you about her?
That was not an incident! I-I was gesturing, a-and the plate slipped out of my hand.
Oh, I beg to differ. The Pictionary incident?
Okay, look, I-I have enough stuff for one more sandwich, I mean I was going to eat it myself, but
Just a sandwich? Look, I am 30 years old, I'm about to be divorced twice and I just got evicted! That sandwich was the only good thing going on in my life! Someone ate the only good thing going on in my life!
Hi, good morning lover. I gotta say after last night, I'm a little weak in the knees.
Oh, yeah. But you have to give it back if I get a job. Of course, by that time in the future ties will be obsolete and we'll all be wearing silver jump suits.
Yeah. I think you have to draw him out. And then- when you do- he's a preppy animal.
Yeah?
No, it was Ginger. I remember, because when he told me, I said, 'the movie star.'
Nooo. No, no, ah, are you sure it wasn't something that sounded like Ginger, like ah, Gingeer?
She's just upset because she, uh, she buttered a spider into her toast this morning.
I, OK....
So, Mr. Rastatter, what exactly does this job entail? The ad wasn't too clear.
This is a nice resume. Nice, nice, nice. Muy impressivo.
Oh my God! That's great! Oh wow! You're a published writer! I wish I had a present for you!
Who sold a story to Archie Comics?!
What about all the guys that you've got the phone numbers from? Why don't you just kiss one of them?
Well hello !
Hey, Rach. How was it with your friends? Okay! How would you like some Tiki Death Punch?
Well. Your mom didn't tell us about the blobbies.
Wow, this is so weird. I just realized this might be the last time we'll all be hanging out together.
Oh God, I really missed that fat bastard!
Um, I straightened out your shower curtain so you won't get mildew. What? To me that's nice.
Yes, I was going to incorporate that. Oh good, here's Monica, she'll have something nice to say.
If it makes anybody feel better, then we can just forget the thing, and we'll just do the gift.
Basically, there's the thing, and then there's the stuff after the thing.
You know what would be real weird? Is if you weren't there. Just say you'll think about it, okay?
This isn't one of those uh, y'know "If she doesn't come, we-we don't, we don't come?" Right? Because I already bought my ticket...
Just out. Had some lunch, just me, little quality time with me. Thanks for your jacket.
They took Ben to the park. Where've you been?
I just checked my messages, and he said that when he gets back from Atlanta, we need to talk.
What?!
All right!! All right. I got stung. Stung bad. I couldn't stand. I-I couldn't walk.
Well, we have to say something! We have to get it out! It's eating me alive!! Monica got stung by a jellyfish.
Oh, I'm sorry honey, you know, but when she said "sex" I wasn't thinking about "sex with you"!
Seriously, answer faster!
Sweetie, with you it's gonna be different. The sex is gonna be great, 'cause you-you guys are in love.
We share a wall! So either he's great in bed, or she just likes to agree with him a lot.
Oh yeah, I got soap and sponges and rags and Carnuba wax and polishing compound.
The ones that got me the Porsche! Will you keep up! But I figured, if-if people keep seeing me just standing there, they're gonna start to think that I don't own it. So I figured I'll wash it. Right? Monica, you got a bucket and some soap I can borrow?
Can we turn the TV off? Okay? Do we really want to spend the entire weekend like this?
Nothing! It's over! Dammit! This is regularly scheduled programming!
Hey, it is unreasonable to expect a child to wait for a light bulb to cook brownies!
Yeah, not as much as you used to love to play uncooked batter eater.
Rach, you're in a great place in your life. Come on, you've got a great job! Good friends...
And now Chandler! We're all gettin' so old! Why are you doing this to us?!
Look at us all dressed up for the big office party! By the way, what are we celebrating?
Anybody gonna eat that?
Limited seating! Oh, that is such a lame excuse! That's not the reason she's not inviting me!
Well yeah, but she doesn't know that. I mean, the last time she saw you-you would've turned one of those little wedding chairs into kindling.
Well if Ted Kopel talked about his coworkers botched boob jobs, I would.
Well, maybe sometimes I find out things or I hear something and I pass that information on y'know kinda like a public service, it doesn't mean I'm a gossip. I mean, would you call Ted Kopel a gossip?
So I made snacks. Please, just hang out okay? I'm just gonna rest my eyes just a little bit.
Oh yeah!
Yeah, they were just slowing me down. Alright, I have to get back to the babies. I'll see you girls later.
Yeah, you didn't even use the tools for most of it!
Oh y'know what? If you're gonna be acting like this all night, I really, I don't even want to be around you.
That's so funny, because I think I just did!
Come on! Tests make us all better learners! Oh yeah! We should have essay questions!!
A test?!!
Joey! This is not like learning to ride a horse! This is like learning to...grow a turtleneck!
I don't know! I really want this part! And they tell you no matter what you get asked at an audition you say yes. Like if-if they want you to ride a horse, you tell 'em you can! And just figure out how to do it later.
So if everyone liked it, and you liked it, that would make this a success. Which would make you...
I thought it was... quite tasty.
All right. I know you're not happy about us moving, but you're the only one who hasn't seen the house.
No, thank you.
Alright. If you guys don't want it to be special, fine. You can throw any kind of party you want.
Yeah, I agree. Ya know, I think fancy parties are only fun if you're fancy on the inside and I'm just not sure we are.
Whoa! Whoa!! Tackled by a girl! Bet ya don't see that everyday, do ya?
Hi.
Of course there's another guy!! This is even more perfect! Now you have to prove your love!
Well...
I couldn't eat it! I had five friends who couldn't eat it, and one of them eats books.
I want a retraction! Our food is not inedible swill!
You bet that I'd screw up?! So all that stuff about hiring me because I was good was...
Um-hmm.
All right then, when I'm done with this place, it's gonna be ten times better than that place!
Yeah, that's true.
Alright, you know, we got it, we got it. Let's play for real. High stakes... big bucks...
OK, so at this point, the dealer...
Well, she corned me! She asked if the wedding was in town! I mean, what was I supposed to do?!
You said no right?!
No, it's okay, not only did I get to go out with Chip Matthews, I got to dump Chip Matthews.
Oh honey, I'm sorry.
Here, I got it. I'll will play my message for you guys, and you can tell me if it's breezy enough.
Well, how could it not be breezy, no, 'cause, you're, you're in such a breezy place.
You guys haven't gotten your presents yet? Tomorrow's Christmas Eve, what're ya gonna do?
Yeah, what're you guys doin' here, aren't you supposed to be Christmas shopping?
I am going... I'm going--Turn it over! I'm... I am going to get these drops in your eyes.
What are you? Monica!! Stop it!! Oh my God! Stop it!
Alright, but I'm very excited about this OK, so you gotta promise you won't get all big-brothery and judgmental.
Come on, tell me.
Really. Well, at least 'big girls' don't pee in their pants in seventh grade!
Hello? Like he was really gonna send you one? She was a big girl.
Didn't you listen to the story? I mean, this is twisted! How could you get involved with a woman like this?
What 'not work out'? I'm seeing her again on Thursday. Didn't you listen to the story?
Okay, if Joey does the ceremony, then we have to find someone else to walk Phoebe down the isle.
I had to read the Bible pretty carefully, but... yeah we do.
You know it's funny, the last time Paulo was here, my hair was so much shorter and cuter.
Are you sure he's gonna be able to crack that code?
Okay. I gotta call Michelle. I gotta see if that was her voice or not. I'm sorry, I just have to.
Thank you!
I'm so sorry, I can't believe I did this, but I couldn't stop laughing at your Norman Mailer story.
Yeah. I'm thinking, if we put our heads together, between the two of us, we can break them up.
: yea well the weird part is... he was getting off to a shark attack show!
Oh that couldn't have been pretty. but you know guys do that.
Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- -I'd want yours.
Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done.
Yeah... Yeah, I know it's pretty selfish, but haha, hey, that's me. Why don't you try the hummus?
Really?
Look, all we're trying to say is, don't let what happened with Carol ruin what you got with Emily.
This is not fun!
Ugh, we're screwed, aren't we? You know what? Just tell me on the way to the bird store.
Hello, this is Chandler Bing. Somebody just dropped off a handwritten recommendation letter, and.. Uh-huh... Uh-huh... okay... thank you. Good-bye. .
And he came at us with an axe, so Rachel had to use a bug bomb on him!
It was like this crazy-eyed, hairy beast man! He was like a, like a bigfoot or a yeti or something!
Y'know, I only know of two surefire ways to shut a man up. And one of them is sex.
Like a little girl. I know. I know. I know. This is all my fault; I wanted him to open up. But God, I didn't know that I was gonna unleash this-this weepy, clingy, moist monster!
Well, I was thinking, that you gave the guys such great haircuts, I thought, maybe you'd like to do mine?
All right, so what were you thinking?
You know what? It seems like you've been making an awful lot of stuff Irish lately.
Yeah, we're gonna... we're gonna get some cake.
Mmm, looking good. Ok, cider's mulling, turkey's turking, yams are yamming. What?
Tonight, on a very special Blossom.
It will be my pleasure. My guy has diplomatic coupons. Your guy can't even say coupons.
I have just resigned my post. Would you care to accompany me to the Rainbow Room? I have diplomatic coupons.
Oh, I wish there was a job where I could wear this all the time. Maybe someday, there will be.
Y'know, I gotta tell ya, this really does put in a better mood.
All right, I'll go down there. But, I'm not gonna serve the lasagna. I'm gonna serve something I make.
Okay, umm, if a kid gets straight A's, his parents would say, "Yeah, he pulled a Monica." Y'know? Or a fireman saves a baby, and they go, "Yeah I know, he pulled a Monica." Or someone hits a homerun and the announcer says, "Yeah, that one's outta here." Though some things don't change.
Because it would totally freak him out and tomorrow's our anniversary. I just don't want anything to spoil that.
Ooh! So now why can't we tell Chandler?
All right... you're right. We're sorry. Now let's wake up Emma and get the fun time started!
Look, I know that you guys really want to get to Vermont and this isn't a really big deal to you, but it really is to us, ok? Emma will never have a first birthday again.
Hello? It's Joey. I'm so glad you called! Chandler told me what happened. Y'know he's really upset about it.
Ooh that is definitely Chandler, Joey, or Ross. Or-or Rachel!
No! No it's not! It's not gonna be okay! It sucks! No swing band! No lilies!
Honey, it's gonna be okay.
Okay, I've had it with the hair jokes. Tomorrow morning, before we leave, I'm going to the salon.
That's not true. I came with Monica and I'm leaving with Weird Al.
I have no moves. Okay, whatcha doin' there?! Oh y'know what? I'm sorry, this is just too weird.
I have some moves.
Ohh, this is soo amazing! I can't believe my brother's getting married! And in London! It's so romantic!
Yeah.
Pheebs, you've been up for 24 hours! Go to sleep, honey. Th-this isn't healthy.
Please stay on the line. You're call is very important to us.
And then Chandler was, was really sweet and he consoled me. And well we drank too much...
Oh.
Hey, hey, look. Look Ross, Ben drew a picture of you! Huh? You're-you're a cowboy!
Look at me!
Oh, well, I bought Chandler a five hundred dollar watch and he wrote me a rap song.
I doubt that! Tell her about us last year.
All right, there's some pizza at my place, we can all eat with one hand right? Are you with me?
I'm still hungry!
Please? Please?! We just don't want to deal with telling everyone, okay? Just promise you won't tell.
No-no-no-no-no! You can't!
No. It was painful. Oh my God , they should call it Pain-zine, now with a little wax.
Was it not pain-free?
No, to get a table! Places like are always shakin' you down. Everybody wants to be paid off.
Give him money? It was a joke!
What are you talking about? She obviously lives on the second floor, seventh apartment from the left!
Because it's impossible to find her apartment! She lives in some like of hot girl parallel universe, or something.
Okay, now Thanksgiving's over, let's get ready for Christmas. Who wants to go get a Christmas tree?!
No, it wasn't. It was actually the...
Oh, then bring it on! Oh, unless of course your afraid you might lose to a bunch of girls.
What?! The guys against the girls? See, that's ridiculous Monica, because I'm only down by three touchdowns.
How many perfectly fine women are you gonna reject over the most superficial insignificant things?
I'm tellin' you, she leaned back, I could see her brain.
That's right. That's right. And that is why you can't stay here tonight. And probably why you shouldn't come to the wedding.
Say again?
Nothin', nothin', hey you're a cheapasaurus. I'm kidding, I'm kidding, thank you, I'm very greatful.
Yeah, yeah I mean, you get your money and you learn a little something, what's wrong with that?
Look, doctor! Look, before we sign anything we really have to talk... We're not who you think we are.
Yeah. It's a sonogram they took of the baby last week. I thought you might want to see it.
Bouncy baby, Bouncy baby, Ooh baby baby, Ooh baby baby, Ooh baby baby.
I have to go scream into a pillow.
: Here why don't you sit down, get yourself comfortable because I. have a little surprise for you.
oh it was great.
Okay. But wait, we can't. My Cousin Cassie is in the guest room, we're supposed to have lunch.
That's me! Come on!
Well, uh y'know, our guy works with Chandler and he's really nice and smart and he's a great dresser!
A chin dimple!
What we did was wrong. Oh god, I just had sex with somebody that wasn't alive during the Bicentennial.
Ok...ay.
Ok, let's see... Oh, the cranberry sauce, it is easy to make and no-one really cares about it.
I'm serious, let me do something, just not the turkey or the stuffing, nothing "high profile".
-but that wouldn't be fair to me, it wouldn't be fair to Alan- It wouldn't be fair to you!
Okay!
But getting over was the hardest thing that I've ever had to do. And I never let myself think about you.
Ahh.
Oh, you mean like that guy thing where you act mean and distant until you get us to break up with you.
I know, that, that's why I don't want to go tonight, I'm afraid I'm going to say something stupid.
Can you believe it? ...Y'know what? I just don't feel the thing. I mean, they feel the thing, I don't feel the thing.
Waitwait.. we talking about the coyotes here? All right, a cow got through!
Hello, this is Monica... Yeah??? Oh... Okay, yes, we'll be right, we'll be right down. Thank you.
Okay no, you do it.
And then we're gonna have a little Middle Eastern cous-cous. Something we can eat, with our hands.
So oysters, huh?
Chandler, I'm unemployed and in dire need of a project. Ya wanna work out? I can remake you.
No, not wieght... y'know, more like insulation.
Look , I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have.
She's already fluffed that pillow... Monica, you know, you've already fluffed that- -but, it's fine!
Y'know when girls sleep with guys with weird things on their body, they tell their friends about it.
Thank you, but I want to remove it Pheebs. I don't want to make it savory.
Rachel, if you want the little round waffles, you gotta have to wait until I find the little waffle iron.
Ohh, whoa God! Storage rooms give me the creeps! Monica, come on please hurry up honey! Please?
Oh, I don't know. Maybe, um, "That was nice?" Admit something to me? "I'll call you?"
Well, what do you want me to say?
Really? Wow, well then come on, I wanna show you how to fold the toilet paper into a point.
Actually, if it's possible, I love you more.
Okay, I'm gonna go check on something across the hall. You start by washing these Not with soap!!
Tell me more.
Oops! Y'know, your birthday is in a month-and-a-half, what do you say I forget to get you a present for that too?
Wow! You are way to young to have seen that!
Ohhh! What are you doing to me?! Oh look, I-I... I'm sorry but umm, this-this-this-this is not going to happen.
Working with blind kids.
She picked Rachel. I mean, she tried to back out of it, but it was obvious. She picked Rachel.
Maybe I could be a waiter. Could I use the phone?
All right, so I haven't cleared the budget with my parents yet, but tell me how this is for music.
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm so rude. Does anyone want to come to the movies?
Yeah.. uh, but for future reference, that thing in your hand can also be used as a phone.
Can I use your phone?
You better believe he's tired, after the day we had! If you know what I mean. You know what I mean?
You tired Chandler?
It's beautiful! It's like the first bathroom floor there ever was. Whoa! Are you going in there for?
Yeah! Hey, do Monica and Rachel work there?
Oh! Why didn't you tell me? I made him his own individual sweet potato stuffed pumpkin.
Oh, right. Sorry. But Tag's not coming; his girlfriend came into town, so he's spending Thanksgiving with her.
Ok listen, you go down to the pool and reserve the chairs, and I'll get the magazines and the lotion.
Hey! Remember when I had corneas?
All right everybody! Everybody guess what? I just convinced Paul to give us a test next week!
I don't know! I didn't come with her!
No no. See, in my bedroom I set my clock six minutes fast. You wanna know why?
Well, I'm confused. I thought we shared time.
The muscles from Brussels, wham bam Van Damme, did you see Time Cop?
Ya think?
Really well. Yeah. Surprisingly well. Yeah, she didn't cry. She wasn't angry or sad.
Oh yeah? Well, how'd she take it?
Umm, so how long have you been working with your dad? Come on, one of us had to mention him.
If that helps you.
Well, umm, Walker was looking for this big bus load of kids.... All right, I get your point.
Monica, last Saturday night, what happened on Walker Texas Ranger?
Oh my God! You own an Italian restaurant and you think that tastes good?! Where are you even from?
Hey! I'm proud of that sauce, it's delicious.
Ross! That is so sweet of you to get Phoebe that bike! When I heard the story, I almost cried.
Well, it gets worse. When asked if you take initiative I wrote, "Yes, he was able to unhook my bra with minimal supervision," and under Problems with Performance I wrote, "Dear God, I hope not," and then uh, then I drew a little smiley face, and then a small pornographic sketch.
Phoebe! Rachel! It's Monica! I wonder what you could possibly need me for on such short notice! Oh.
Say something clever! Okay, doesn't have to be clever, it just has to be words. Say some words. Any words will do. Oh my God! This is the longest that anyone has not talked ever! There is nothing you can say to make this worse!! So just say something!! I-I, I uh haven't had sex in a very long time. Yeah, you really shouldn't have said anything.
Oh my God. Okay, go into the bathroom, use whatever you want, just don't ever tell me what you did in there.
Whaddya think? Today's the big day!
Phoebe, relax none of that stuff ever happens! They just put it on there for legal reasons!
Oh my God! Dizziness, nervousness, drowsiness, facial swelling, nausea, headache-Headache. Vomiting, stomach bleeding, liver damage! Now okay, I don't recall any of this coming up when you gave me these little death capsules! Oh I'm sorry, extra strength death capsules!
Doctor, can I see you for just a minute please? My brother has a slight phobia about needles.
Hello, there. I'm Dr. Carlin. I see someone's having an allergic reaction.
Okay, how about the fact that he's engaged to another woman, who just happens to be your ex-best friend?
I have my reasons.
Hi. We're buying the house next door, and we were wondering if we could just take a look around.
Yeeeah!
You have nothing! You're not even going out! You're her baby sitter! You have a 12-year-old girl's job!
You see Amanda and I have a very special...
No-no-no, that's a video-phone. But hey guys you're not supposed to be here, so please, do not touch anything.
Whoa! For a rich guy he's got, that's a pretty small TV.
Drunk enough that I know I wanna do this. Not so drunk that you should feel guilty about taking advantage.
How drunk are you?
Behind my brother's back? ... is exactly the kind of crazy thing you won't be hearing from me.
C'mon up.
No. No you can't go. No this is fun. Come on we're just getting started. Here, here's your marker.
I um, was sorta thinking about maybe...
Okay, come on, I can't get married until I get something old, something new, something borrowed, and something blue.
Oh, okay.
Would you look at them. Am I ever gonna find a boyfriend again? I gonna die an old maid.
Hey, Bonnie had sex there!
Wait a minute...Joey. Joey you can't ask her out, she's your roommate. It-it'll be way too complicated.
Ugh, I cannot wait to ask her out!
Oh, I know. I know. Hey, you know, you can take it if you want! The lease is still in Nana's name.
Oh man, I can't believe you guys are leaving this place.
You gotta go home and get the earrings that you borrowed from me okay? Chandler wants me to wear them tonight.
But I like it here!
No honey. You have to sleep on this side of the bed because I have to sleep on this side of the bed.
Yeah. I have to sleep, have to, on this side of the bed.
Okay. Umm, y'know, I don't think, I don't think I told you this, but umm, I just got out of a really serious relationship.
Just tell me the truth.
Come on! Surprise her! Show up at her doorstep! Don't let her go without a fight!
Really?
Okay, so, uh, we're in France, we're making the toast. Do you see a little bassinet in the corner?
Well, uh, sometimes I think about selling my practice, we could move to France, make French toast.
Wow, all you need now is The Killing Fields and some guacamole and you've got yourself a part-ay.
Ok, Love Story, Brian's Song, and Terms of Endearment.
Wow! You might just get the first Nobel prize in rubbing. So what country is this guy from?
Oh!! That's my new thing. I figure bodies at peace, make peace.
Phoebe, it's not what you wear. It's sort of your songs... I just don't think you should play at the restaurant anymore.
Right, yeah, ok, I'll ask the butler to fetch my diamonds out of the vault.
I'm gonna hang this basket on the door and when the neighbors walk by they can all take a piece.
I'm sorry, who?
That's Paul's watch. You just put it back where you found it. Oh boy. Alright. Goodnight, everybody.
Hey Mon, look what I just found on the floor. What?
Y'know, I-I-I don't think that I can. So if you don't mind, maybe this will be it for me on the work things.
Oh, you get used to it.
But either way... You're gonna get married, you're gonna be happy, my mom's gonna like you better than me.
I suppose it wouldn't be the end of the world... Oh, thank you!
Really! All right? Let's forget about this going home stuff and celebrate our anniversary. Okay, this is empty.
Really?!
uh huh.. I mean these things happen. Its' just a plate. Its not like somebody died.
Are you okay Mon?
Hand me those tomatoes, I'm gonna show you what it should taste like! Come on, hand me them.
Lebanon.
Alright, I'll tell you what. I'll come get you in 5 minutes with some sort of um, kabob emergency.
See.
Really, Rachel, I was thinking of you the whole time. Look, I'm sorry, all right. I never meant for you to find out!
Yeah, right. Sure!
Oh really, you want to talk about quality? Have you heard of a key? It's what some people sing in.
Well...it's not about quality.
Phoebe is going to say "Yes" to David. See, that's what happens when you meddle in people's lives!
Oooh! I hope you're happy too, honey!
No. It disappears back there behind that baseboard. For a minute there, I thought it went downstairs.
And did you?!
Oh, Phoebe, she couldn't stop crying! With those thick glasses, her tears looked giant.
But Mon, you have to get our money!
Oh, no! I mean, obviously we want to see you take your clothes off! You big piece of eye candy!
Are you talking about me?
What if I have babies, okay? I mean I'm gonna look different. I'm okay with that, but I'm not sure that you are!
You were not supposed to hear that! I said that behind you back!
What am I gonna do?! That is the dress! That is the dress! Wh...Chandler wants the band. What do I do?
Does that mean Carcass is available?
Ya know, Roy saw Star Wars 317 times. His name was in the paper.
Oh my God, look there's Roy Gublik.
Joey, put that down! Oh my God! It's Pete. Okay, get out!! How the hell do you answer a video-phone!
Look at this! A millionaire's checkbook.
"Take me to the mansion in the sky-y". I am sorry, the song is over. Did you see me out there?
Oh, not with my combination of ice cubes, aloe Vera and my gentle self-loathing touch.
Now Joey, you go down there and you suck up to him. I mean you suck like you've never sucked before!
That's not true!
You know that's nice, y'know we could put it back there after the surgeons remove it from your colon!
Eh! There you go.
Come on Chandler, come on! It'll give us great practice for when--people with babies come to visit.
Yeah, I'm gonna pass. 'Cause I was kinda iffy when it was puppies.
It is in the living room where there is also a light! And no one will kick you in the shin.
Sorry, I just...can't sleep. Ooh! Where is that book that you are reading with the two women who were ice-skating and wearing, wearing those hats with the flowers on it? Because every time I look at that cover I'm like...
Oh! Ohhhhh! Oh! Phoebe, come here. Aw, this is my new bed. You gotta feel this bad boy.
Hi. Y'know in England this car would be on the other side of the store. Woo!
That's mine!! Now, would you both please start acting like adults? And get me my cough drops!
Hey, so he stole a couple bucks from me! At least he bought me something with it!
Drunk enough to know that I want to do this. Not so drunk that you should feel guilty about taking advantage.
How drunk are you?
Look at me! My big concern is what's real?! Oh my God. We're really sad, aren't we?
I'm not gonna right to you! That's not real!
Hey, I just whipped us up some Easy Bake treats, they should be ready in about three days.
Hey.
I gotta make up the guest bedroom. Hey, Cousin Cassie is coming to stay with us a few days.
Sure.
Well, it's the thought. Hey, doesn't Ross's flight get in in a couple hours? At gate 27-B?
From you. I exchanged the blouse you got me.
Look what I got! Look what I got! Look what I got! Can you believe they make these for little people?
Oh, I chose not to hear that.
Hey, you better hope that we're pregnant, because one way or another, we're giving a baby back to Rachel.
Okay.
I'll get it. Hello. Hi Emily! Yeah, uh you-you tracked him down. Hold on one second.
It's almost as if he knew.
Oh now that-that-that's funny, it seems like Chandler's conference could've been in Connecticut or Vermont.
Oh weird, Chandler just told us he's got a conference there!
Okay, is this like 'I have an early class tomorrow' or 'I'm secretly married to a goat?'
Uuh, before we get into any staying-over-stuff, there is something you should know.
Ok, the first person's most embarassing memory is, 'Monica, your party sucks.' Very funny.
All righty roo. What a great moment to say that for the first time.
I am not 'so'! OK, I was a teensy bit weird at first, but... I'll be good. I promise.
Monica, nothing has even happened yet, and you're already so...
All right, look, I hate this as much as you, but if it makes you feel better, it's all your fault.
Noooo.
I know. But umm, one time there was this really dirty car in front of the building, so I washed it.
You don't even have a car!
You know, on the way over here, I saw this drunk guy throw up. And then a pigeon ate it!
I've missed you too.
Um, well, I was going to, I-I-I really was. But um, then somewhere, just out of nowhere, I didn't.
Why haven't you told them?!
: Hey Rach its me ok I just got the Chandler's room and I caught him molesting himself.
Hello.
But I figured, you know, that shouldn't change anything. I mean, what the hell does it matter how old we are.
Huh!
Nice work everybody! So much for the y'know, "You can drive it, but don't tell Rachel" plan!
I've never driven it! Okay? Not once! Okay once. Okay, I drive it all the time.
Now we just have to wait for a call and... and someone tells us there's a baby waiting for us. Oh...
That's great!
For your information, ass munch, I've lost four pounds. Maybe even five with all the dancing.
Soo... you girls having fun?
No, no! We should divide them up and I should get extra because we used my card to buy them!
Oh, you guys! We've got to keep all the tickets together.
Well, maybe you should send him something. So that when he gets to Las Vegas he'll know that you're sorry.
Y'know, he won't even talk to me. How am I going to apologize to him if he won't even talk to me?
No Joey! Chandler could be your assistant! See, he could answer all of your fan mail and stuff!
That's an idea! Hey, if I hired an assistant, would-would you take money from her?
No, it doesn't, does it? But you wanted lumps, Ross? Well, here you go, buddy, ya got one.
Here we come, walkin' down thethis doesn't smell like Mom's.
Alright, for the bizillionth time, yes I see other women in shower at the gym, and no I don't look.
Oh, hey, Monica, we've got a question.
Well I think the length of teasing is directly related to how insane you were so, a long time.
Okay, how long is this going to go on.
Come here. I'll make you feel like one of the guys. You know for a really cool guy, you suck at foosball.
Yeah, just, I feel like I'm about a hundred. I thought I was just one of the guys.
All right, fine. Tonight's potatoes will be both mashed with lumps, and in the form of tots.
But my mom always makes them. It's like a tradition. You get a little piece of turkey on your fork, a little cranberry sauce, and a tot! It's bad enough I can't be with my family because of my disease.
No! Wait! I think I can figure out the recipe from this cookie! I do stuff like this at work all the time.
'Cause it's gross.
Alright, well, this does not change anything. Okay, we need to get something to grease the sides of his face.
Alright, hurry up, you gotta do something.
What?! You can't shed a tear for your dead wife!! Now, I left you a note from the beyond!
What?!
My god, if I had a nickel for every guy I wish I hadn't..., but this is about your horrible mistake.
People do stupid things when they're upset.
What is the matter with you?! Do you want to fall into the trap? Do you want to fall into the trap?!
Yeah.
So the wedding caterer sent me this list of twelve appetizers and I have to narrow it down to six.
Oh, it's like huge weight has been lifted! 'Cause look, no hair loss, not a rash, no hives, I'm just so happy! Because no shortness of breath, no temporary euphoria-Oh.
This is so bizarre. I guess it kinda makes sense though, y'know she had such a terrible childhood.
Wow! I mean, I just-I can't, I can't believe this. Y'know, I mean you think you know someone even, even Phoebe who's always been somewhat of a question mark.
Yeah! All right, maybe you don't have to smile. Let's try something else. Let's try umm, try looking sexy.
I do?
Oh my God, sit down! Sit down! How long as it been since we've seen each other?
Hi!
Oh! Oh my God! That is the most beautiful top of a head I have ever seen! Chandler, you have to see this!
The baby's head is crowning.
Ow! Oh, that sounds nice! I am just there for jury duty. They really spruce that place up!
City Hall.
Well, spring vacation is doing nice things with your grandparents. Spring break you're doing frat guys.
What's-what's the difference?
Oh, just some pictures I made and hung up. I thought they'd brighten up the place. They do don't you think?
What-what are-what are these?
MEG was good for me but I dumped her. Ya know, my motto is get out before they go down.
What happened to uh, MEG.?
Ugh, I can not believe this! I mean, who is she to judge us? We could not have been nicer to her!
So she was just pretending to have a good time last night? She was lying to our faces?!
Oh sure, now you're Mister Sensitivity. But when you wanted to have sex right after my uncle's funeral.
Look, I can't do this. I can't make luv to you while we're fighting this way.
Well, every, every Thanksgiving um, we used to have a touch football game called the 'Geller Bowl.'
Yeah.
Because! She's my cousin. I mean, we grew up together! We're family y'know? Well that's important to me.
Bec-Did you not hear me?! She's an assistant professor in the Linguistics department, okay? They're wild! Why do you want to come anyway?
Oh, you must be freezing. You know what you need? How about a nice steaming cup of hot Mockolate?
I am, uh, I am...
So Nancy told me about this job at this great restaurant, Javo . It's just a little outside of Tulsa.
What?
Well sure! I'm just wearing sweats! But that's good that you're not in love with me, because you just want a girlfriend!
Well there you have it!
It says "Do it!". And behold she did adopt onto them a baby. And it was good.
Reverend, can I ask? Does the bible say anything about adoption?
We were on the platform, ready to dance the world into the new Millennium, and the guy yelled 'CUT!'
Uh, yeah, okay. Except I sorta felt like I needed a couple of seconds to get ready.
Wow, isn't it ironic that David would show up on the same day that you and Mike exchange keys?
I know! Evil! And... and... and... I like Mike so much, you know. It's just going really well. Oh my God!
I'm sorry, okay. It's just that Chandler has somebody, and Phoebe has somebody- I thought I'd ask Fun Bobby.
So tell me something. What does the phrase 'no date pact' mean to you?
We're going to Las Vegas to see your dad. It's time you two talked, and I want to get to know my father-in-law.
Are you serious?! I mean like eloping?! No more stupid wedding stuff?! No more these flowers or these flowers or these flowers-Think of the money we'll save!! We're not eloping. I love the flowers. Can our wedding be bigger please?
Yeah, you're my husband. I'm not gonna live in a different state than you for 208 days out of the year.
Really?
It is nothing like the Hobbit. It's like reading about every relationship I've ever had, except for Richard.
Well that sounds kinda cool, kinda like The Hobbit.
Ross, but me down for another box of the mint treasures, okay. Where, where are the mint treasures?
I spelled out boobies.
Did you just hung up on me? All right, look, I need you at the rehearsal dinner tonight at 1800 hours.
Well, I don't care, so you pick!
Believe me, Chandler and I have not seen each other in over a week. We'll probably be the first ones there.
Ohh. Oh wait! you guys won't be late for my dinner, will you?
No. If you thought this mess is going to bother me, you are wrong! All right, let's go Blinky! Chandler!!!!
All right! Let's get this over with! Ugh! Ohhh! No! Look what I did! Oh, I mean, look at this mess! I mean, we're probably gonna have to clean this up! Y'know? We're gonna have to reschedule!
God! Look at all these tickets! It's so exciting! You know I haven't won anything since the sixth grade.
What's that now? Opening credits.
Okay, just stay there a couple more hours and if she doesn't show up by then, then just come on home.
About four hours.
Oh, well don't take it to the same place you took the stereo, 'cause they've had that thing for over a week.
I'm just taking it to be re-wired.
Damnit! Y'know this whole time we were concentrating on watching the babies and, and no one was watching Chandler!
Well, I was trying to prove that I was right. Y'know? And it turns out I was wrong. And now it's lodged in my throat.
You're the most incredible woman I've ever met. How can I lose you? Now, I don't actually have a ring...
Alright, but after this I want to see you outside. If the rain stops.
Well, that's different. My lie didn't make one of us a felon in 48 states. What were you thinking?
Well, you never told me how old you were.
All right, it'll be great! You just make her think you wanna have sex with her! It'll totally freak her out!
And Joey, get me a bottle of wine and glasses?
Two guys in one night? Wow, I thought she became a slut after she got her nose fixed.
You kissed her that night too?
Yeah and you better watch the flirting too, cause you know, in such close quarters, it could be trouble.
Oh, Oh, you're right! I don't want that. I can't date her!
Alright, lets say that it is him, would we not want the baby? No! Would we treat him any differently?
Honey, it's us. Of course it's the shovel-killer.
Sorry! I'm just-I'm not very good at this! I'm a terrible liar and I hate having to lie to Rachel!
All right, so you're telling me that I have to tell racist jokes now?!
Have you lost your mind? Chandler, this isn't about me! This is about you and all your weird relationship commitment crap!
Oh please, you are obsessed with babies and-and marriage and everything that's related to babies and-and marriage! I've got an idea, why don't we turn down the heat on this pressure cooker?!
Well, my financially challenged friends, I split my money and I bought some shares of CHP and ZXY.
How did you make $17.
Rachel would be Phoebe's, I would be Rachel's, that way we all get to do it once and no one would get upset.
Uh-hmm.
No, it just remind me of something this guy did today at work. I told you about that funny guy, Geoffrey, right?
What's with the word y'all? You know, just... two words just... pushed together... Are we all allowed to do that, because if so, I say why stop there? You know, your new poodle could be your noodle. And fried chicken? Could be fricken.Waiter, waiter excuse me, I'll have the fricken? See, that's... that's funny with the fricken, right?
Y'know what, don't tell us. We'll just wait until Chandler gets home, because it'll be more fun that way.
What, oh, oh, oh, no, no, I can't, I can't tell you that, it's like the most awful, horrible thing I've ever done my whole life.
Y'know, it is so strange seeing Ross here this time of day, 'cause usually he's got the children's hospital.
Okay umm, why don't we all take a seat, y'know? And uh, and I'll get us all some uh some coffees--Yeah, why don't you. Uh and you guys can talk about whatever, whatever you want. Y'know? Whatever pops into your head.
I mean, you're the one they're gonna come to when they wanna run away from home, and the one they talk to about sex.
No, really. Really, Pheebs, you're not gonna be the one worrying about saving for college, or yelling at them when they're bad, y'know, or deciding to put them on Ritalin when they just won't calm down. Y'know?
I'm sorry it's just, Phoebe just always thought you were, you were charming in a, in a sexless kind of way.
Ow!
Because... We may not be who she thinks we are but no-one will ever love that baby more than us.
But we are not the one she chose! How can you feel okay about this?
I am so glad you guys got together, Chandler and I are always looking for a couple to go out with and now we have one!
...so then the farmer says, "That's not a cow and you're not milking it."
Please, when he left town you stayed in your pajamas for a month and I saw you eat a cheeseburger.
OK, I wasn't in love with him and I was just helping out a friend.
So, if you're parents hadn't got divorced, you'd be able to answer a question like a normal person?
Oh I do! Op, no, wait a minute, I took it out of my shirt when I put it on this morning.
You guys, I ordered some chocolate pies from that bakery on Bleecker. Could you pick them up for me?
Oh, yeah, happy needless-turkey-murder day.
Having a perfectly decorated tree is not what Christmas is about. It's about being with the people that you love.
Wow, Monica's letting other people help decorate her tree! Did someone get her drunk again or?
Ok, you see, the tag shouldn't be at the top left corner, it should be at the bottom right corner.
You're pretty much running that risk either way.
You're going to talk to him! Y'know what? We made a deal, I make your decisions and I say you're going to talk to him.
Oh, I don't know. I don't know.
Okay, Rachel, do you have any idea how painful it is to tell someone that you love them and not have them say it back?
Well, y'know what, that doesn't matter.
"Hi I'm Rachel, is my sweater too tight? No? Oh, I'd better wash it and shrink it!"
You know what else I'm not gonna miss? "I'm Monica. I wash the toilet 17 times a day. Even if people are on it!"
Okay, Okay, All right. What if we got both houses? Huh? We can turn this house into a guest house.
The only way that that is going to happen, is if the other couple are the Hitlers.
Ah no, you see, someone was supposed to take them down around New Years... but obviously someone forgot.
So tell me something, is leaving the Christmas lights up part of your plan to keep us merry all year long?
Okay, everybody relax. This is not even a date. It's just two people going out to dinner and- not having sex.
Just, 'cause, I don't want her to go through what I went through with Carl- oh!
Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet!
Jeez!
Tonight you're supposed to waitress for me, my catering thing, any of those words trigger anything for you?
Hi.
Did anybody else feel they just wanted to peel the skin off their body, to have something else to do?
God. I feel violated.
It's okay. I suppose it could happen to anyone, not anyone I know, but... By the way I can still see it.
Well usually...yeah! Well, not just lemonade, iced tea, sometimes juice. Well, sorry, I just, I thought you liked me. I'm such a jerk.
Look at it! Ohhh! Wallpaper's a little faded, that's okay. Carpet's a little loose. Hardwood floors!!
I know that.
Wow! You're a lot sturdier that Chandler. He crumpled like a piece of paper. So how was you're trip?
Wow! Skates!
Oh, he is. And he is so dreamy. I mean, y'know what, when he left I actually used the phrase, 'Hummina-hummina-hummina.'
Oh yeah! So ah, kinda pretty, pretty good. He sounds like a nice, good guy.
Oh please! Yesterday on the subway? You couldn't stop staring at that woman with the big breasts the whole time.
Excuse me?
Maybe we could call the phone company. Maybe they could change the message. Maybe they can change his number.
Okay, okay, okay, I've got two cabs and no people. Go! Go! Go!
Oh! Let's see, well...if this is the wedding hall then umm you're parents will be at home in Queens.
Hey, so where are my parents gonna be?
I can't believe you married Duncan. I mean how could you not tell me? We lived together, we told each other everything.
Well, I mean, I'm not married married, ya know, he's just a friend and he's gay and he's just from Canada and he just needed a green card.
Maybe. Joey: Wait. Your 'not a real date' tonight is with Paul the Wine Guy?
Paul the Wine Guy, Paul?
Yeah. But of course we had to update it a little bit. Hey, by the way, great thinking about catching me!
Uh, wait, so you guys are telling me you actually did the routine from eighth grade?
Do you realize that four weeks from today we're getting married? Four weeks baby!! Four weeks!!!
Diane Keeton.
Oh..please!I-I welcome criticism. 3rd Customer: The musician right outside the restaurant...it's kind of a mood-killer!
Thank you! You haven't said anything... 3rd Customer: Actually I do have one small complaint.
Do you realize this is probably the last time we'll all be here in the coffee house as six single people?
Oh, let me get this. These are for you.
Okay, we'll start with the building. You guys take the first and second floor, Phoebe and I'll take third and fourth.
Oh, my, God, c'mon, you guys! He's gonna be home any minute! He's gonna kill me!
Oh, I know! Umm, is it because he's always correcting people's grammar? Whom! Whom! Sometimes it's who!
No that made me feel precious.
She's only a couple of months pregnant. She liked our application but who knows if she's gonna like us.
And so incorrect!
Yeah. Go over to Joey's. Go over to Joey's and drink some beer and hammer up some drywall.
Nah, Nah, it's okay. I feel like I need to be in guy place. You know, do kind of like a man thing.
Would you stop? We've only been going out a couple of weeks, I mean we don't even know if he's gonna propose.
Mon you definitely have to make it a theme wedding, and the theme could be, "Look how much money we've got!" Y'know, I mean you could put, you could put money in-in the invitations! You-you could have like little money place settings. And ah, you could start with a money salad! I mean it'll be dry, but people will like it.
Ok, my husband just gave your boyfriend some very bad advice. Look, David is going to propose to you tonight.
Are you leaving "The Supremes"?
How do I tell Chandler that it's too soon. It's gonna break his heart, he's not gonna think that I don't love him anymore.
Girls say it to me all the time! And believe me, if she's anything like me, she's just gonna be relieved.
Am I on fire today or what?! Those birds are browned, basted, and ready to be carved!
We're, we're just gonna get a little sip of water.
See? This is exactly why I'm making this candy. We can learn their names and get to know our neighbors.
I do. There's uh, let's see, Guy With a Mustache, Smokes-A-Lot Lady, Some Kids I've Seen, and A Red-haired Guy Who Does Not Like To Be Called Rusty.
Chandler, this is crazy! What did you even say to him! "Come up, meet my wife! Give us your sperm"!
Well, we're talking about sperm donors and Zack may be the guy! I mean, look, he's intelligent, he's healthy, he's athletic, I mean, he is "spermtastic"!
Does she use the cups? Yes! I believe she does. Does she use the plates? Yes! I believe she does.
All right buddy, time to roll over. No-no! No, no-n-n-n-no!! You are going to a clinic! You're going to a clinic, and a pyjama store!
Chandler, if that dog's been here that long, and you haven't had a reaction, maybe you're not allergic to this dog?
Really?
All right, I'm gonna show you something a lot of guys don't know. Rach, give me that pad, please? All right. Now...
Look, you have to help me! Okay? I mean, I know what to do with a woman, y'know, I know where everything goes, it's always nice. But I need to know what makes it go from nice to, "My God! Somebody's killing her in there!"
Oh, I so can't believe this! My uterus is an inhospitable environment? I was trying so hard to be a good hostess!
Wow! Fortunately she has a very pretty face!
So I'm not supposed to share my doubts and fears with the guy I'm gonna spend the rest of my life with?
All right, I've never been engaged and I've never really been married, but I can only tell you what my mother told me. Whenever you have doubts or fears or anxieties about a relationship, do not communicate them to your husband.
Well, I guess we should go back in. When you gave me another chance, I guess we should do the same for Amanda.
I won't know what I would do without you.
: do you know how many times I've seen him jump up like that, believe me I know what he was doing.
well watching sharks? Are you sure that's what he was doing?
Okay listen, y'know when you move in Rachel's room is gonna be empty, you wanna talk about what we want to do with it?
I don't know! How about, "Thanks for taking the message." Jeez!
Okay, looks like Ross and I are captains. Okay, so um, I bunnied first so that means I get to pick first. Joey.
Bunny!
How great are you, you little saver?! I mean, the-the amount you have is exactly the budget of my dream wedding!
Ohh! Really?!
No that is not what happened with us. Well, I was umm, I was really sad that night because this guy that I was Ross's mom.
Yeah!! I call that London style.
Yeah, ours pretty much sucked, oh, but, I did run into little Stevie Fisher. Remember him?
Oh, well, it pretty much sucked. How was yours?
Let's take a walk. Y'know maybe you should consider writing for Talking Out of Your Ass magazine!
I always thought having a heart attack was nature's way of telling you to die! But you're not gonna die. I mean, you are going to die, but you're not gonna die today. I wish I was dead.
What? what? He obviously thinks that's a nice way to be proposed to, plus he'd never suspect it!
Uuuh!! How about at a Footlocker?
Oh my god, Emma. Oh, sweetie, I forgot you were here. Oh, you're right, we can't do this. We can't leave her alone.
Because of Emma.
My mother's driving me crazy, but Ross is getting married. I'm happy. I'm not going to let anything spoil that.
So how are you doing?
Come on Phoebe, let's go! Come on, it's time to get serious, huddle up. Joey, keep your head in the game.
All right, so are we not having dinner at all?
Oh no-no-no, it's only one night a week, and plus I get to take all of you out for a lot of free dinners.
How could you say yes, what about our catering business?
Okay. It's zero hour. All teams execute on my count. Let's get this bad boy on the road.
I love you.
Yeah, well kinda cute, like really kinda cute, or kinda cute like your friend Spackel Back Larry?
Anyway, I'm going out with Sergei again tonight, and um, could you come and be the translator's date? So that when we, it's time for our alone time, you two could split off. Y'know, he's really, he's kinda cute.
'Cause I just keeping thinking about all these things that I'm not gonna have and it's freaking me out. I don't know what to do about it.
No. Why?
Hey that reminds me, I thought we could use some extra luck so I brought a wishbone home from work.
Hey you guys! Ok, you're not going to believe this! I just saw my psychic and she said I was definitely gonna win the lottery tonight!
Isn't it? Then what about the amazing wainscotting and the crown molding and the dormer windows in the attic?
It's perfect. It's everything we've been looking for.
I'm sorry. But not that sorry, 'cause you don't have to live with it. Um, we have a reservation under the name Chandler Bing.
Hi, could we get two burritos to go, please?
'Cause they took our apartment, I wanted to punish them. But I'm-I'm done now. They've suffered enough.
Well, why did you make like a whole big thing out of y'know, everyone has to hang out in the big apartment?
Ok, I'm sensing that this is some kind of word play, because you are pink with barely controlled glee.
I do! Want a hint? huh? "I do" "I do".
No, honey, its. thats a special plate. See its a game, whoever gets that plate wins.
Hey! How come my plate's less fancy then everyone else's? Do you not trust me with a fancy plate?
No, I think we should save our china for something really special. Like if the Queen of England comes over.
Yeah. Hey, here's an idea, why don't we use our wedding china today?
You are so cute! No. No, it was a fight. You deal with it and move on! It's nothing to freak out about.
So, this isn't over?
You see that guy? He's in classics now, but y'know as soon as we leave he's going straight to the porn.
It's good to see you too.
All right, let me see. Will Chandler have sex tonight? Don't count on it. Seems like it works to me.
Well, I don't know what else to do. I mean, I either keep my wife and lose one of my-my-my best friends or I keep my friend and get divorced the second time before I'm 30! So-so if anyone has-has a better suggestion, let's hear it! 'Cause I-I got nothing! All right, don't be shy, any suggestion will do. Okay then. Here we go. Magic 8 Ball, should I never see Rachel again? Ask again later. Later is not good enough. Ask again later. What the hell! This is broken! It-it is broken!
I missed this apartment! Now, this is a grown-up's apartment! Y'know, I-I should be with a grown-up, do you know what I mean?!
Oh. Whew!
He just told me at the counter. He made me promise not to tell, but I couldn't hold it in any longer!
What?! Really?!
Phoebe, your face is fine! Come on, none of this stuff is going to happen to you! Stop being such a baby!
I feel like my face is swelling. Is my face swelling?
Hi, Ben. Hi. I'm your Aunt Monica. Yes I am. I'm your Aunt Monica. I...I will always have gum.
The head, the head. You gotta...
Uh, no. Loosely translated 'We should do this again' means 'You will never see me naked'.
What? He said 'we should do it again', that's good, right?
Hey. Okay, so umm, since that video camera thing didn't work out uh, I thought that I would give you just a little preview.
Hey.
How could you mess this up? It's so easy? You go into the booth, you count to five and you turn around!!
Oh My God! You can do a duet of Ebony and Ivory all by yourself!
Hey Rach, the adoption agency needs letters of recommendation and we were wondering if you would write one for us.
No! No... and, for the record, I've also never given her a frosting from a can!
Oh my God. That was so amazing! When did you Hold on! I almost forgot loser! When did you stop sucking?
And that's... how... it's done!
Hey, it's Phoebe and Rachel. Um, why don't you tell them what you were telling me earlier about me not being high maintenance?
Hi, oh hi.
Yeah, we switched meat suppliers at work, and the new guys gave me the steaks as sort of a thank-you.
Cool.
Absolutely! Yes, you say to him "I'm sorry Mike I can't live without her, she means too much to me!"
Really? You think?
Ok first of all...It would be great. But that's not what I'm here to talk to you about. I need to borrow some money.
I'd be lying if I said I haven't thought about it myself. Chandler is my best friend, it would be wrong. Good......But wrong.
Abso... ...lutely. See, I love creating new recipes. I love Thanksgiving. And, well, now, I love Mockolate.
Well, anyhoo, um, we are looking for a couple of chefs who can create some Thanksgiving-themed recipes. You think you might be interested?
It's gonna be ok. Ryan's been under water. He's just gonna be so glad that you don't have barnicles on your butt.
I, I, I'm hideous.
I don't know. I mean, you saw him do a love scene, so maybe you don't have a thing for Joey, maybe you have a thing for Drake.
So do you think that my dream means anything?
Huh. So you're saying like umm, if there was an award for the best bad massage, well who would get that?
Okay, hear me out. Okay? You give the best bad massages. If anybody was looking for the best bad massage and they were thinking to themselves, "Who's the best of that?" They'd have to go to you.
Because I need the money, and I thought that it'd be a great way to get rid of that last little schmidgen of self-respect.
How come?
You wanna finish this right now? All right, we get a deck of cards, high card wins. What do you say?
What? Shut up! We're winning!
Oh, she was a cruel, cranky, old bitch! And I'm sorry she died. Did Dad say I get the dollhouse?
Well ah, Aunt Silvia was, well not a nice person.
And it could be soon. I mean, think about it: right now, somewhere out there our baby could be being conceived.
We are gonna be great parents.
Deep Impact was the one with Robert Duval, Armageddon is what's going to happen to you if you wake me up.
I know, just quick-quick question, quick question. Which one was Deep Impact and which one was Armageddon?
Oh wait, wait, unless you happened to catch the Reruns' production of Pinocchio, at the little theater in the park.
I doubt it. Mostly regional work.
I made her. Steel drums don't really say "elegant wedding". Nor does Marjorie's overwhelming scent.
She did? Why?
Dad, dad this is a good thing for me. Ya know, and you even said yourself, you've never seen Richard happier.
Am I supposed to stand here and listen to this on my birthday?
So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks?
...And I read about these women trying to have it all, and I thank God 'Our Little Harmonica' doesn't seem to have that problem.
Sex! This is the last day I'm ovulating, and when we don't do it now, we'll have to wait till next month.
Fine. What!?
Well, at least you have one thing to be happy about. That jerk Gavin from your office didn't show up .
Yeah, I just get a little bummed when my birthday's over.
The strange part was, he was really nice, umm and he looks great, but I didn't feel anything at all!
But again, Simmons. Go on.
Isn't that sad? I mean, can you see how pathetic that is? You shouldn't be jealous. You should feel bad for him.
This is about you and Richard. He's clearly not over you. He keeps a tape so he can... look at it whenever he wants.
I think this is so cool because none of our friends are here and we can be a real couple. We don't have to hide.
Oh, we had a lot of liquor left over from the Christmas party.
Okay, you stay here, and just wait by the phone. Spray Lysol in my shoe, and wait for Ross to kill you.
Well, what'm I gonna do? What'm I gonna do?
All right, hold on okay? First thing's first. Okay, now did Ross sit anywhere while he was naked?
Oh well you're the best. You come here to me.
I don't know, my hand feels weird. I guess it's because, I'm engaged! How long before it starts getting annoying?
What's the matter honey?
Listen, um honey, I appreciate this but you don't have to keep hanging out with them for me, I mean, they have each other.
It's the basketball playoffs.
Y'know in a weird way, you have too much power. Look, you're gonna have to help me out here, 'cause I only have three.
Eight o'clock is the cut-off and, aww, it's 8:02.
I need a few more things to make the margaritas. Uhh, I need some salt, some margarita mix, and tequila.
Hey! What's up?!
Oh it's so cute. I wonder what age it is when you stop being able to put both legs over your head.
Oh, look at little Leslie stretching in her sleep.
No, he's not. And if I can't get pregnant with you, then I don't want to get pregnant by... him or anyone else.
Yeah, he's better!
This is so wild. Ya know, I gotta admit, I was kinda surprised that you agreed to go on a blind date.
Sure.
It is so great to meet a guy who is smart and funny, and has an emotional age beyond, like eight.
Yeah, isn't he?
Is there any chance that you can look at this as flattering? I mean, she's doing it because she wants to be more like you.
I just can't believe this is happening. I mean, when I was little, everybody's parents were getting divorced. I just figured as a grownup I wouldn't have to worry about this.
Well. Sounds like you're writing yourself a little play there Rach. Wow! Let me know how that one turns out.
I overheard you guys on the phone the other day, and you said, "I'll just tell Rachel that I'm doing laundry for a couple of hours." And he said, "Laundry? Is that my new nickname?" And you said, "No! You know what your nickname is, Mr. Big."
What?! I mean, I didn't work this hard and-and-and lose all this weight so that I can give my flower to someone like him!
Well guys tend to get naked before they're gonna have sex.
Come on, get into bed! I want to prove to you that I'm not sick! I wanna make you feel, as good as I feel.
I was asleep. Oh no! No-no honey! Y'know what's sexy? Layers. Layers are sexy. And blankets are sexy. And oh! Hot water bottles are sexy.
And Nancy said that it's really under price, because the guy lost his job and has to move in with his parents!
And the fireplace in the bedroom.
All right, I'm gonna go steam my wedding dress okay? Who wants the responsibility of making sure nothing happens to it?
To the Bings!
Well that's a little crazy. Although I am y'know glad to hear that you're branching out on what you look at on the Internet.
Yeah, Big Brother.
It's 2101 and I am not amused. . Ok, the bride and groom have a few words they'd like to say.
Is that what you say to Chandler?
Wow! Look At This! I Can'T Believe I Even Fit Into This Shirt! Oh, this is yours.
Oh, yeah you loved that glove! You took it every place you went. You never went any place without that glove.
No, no, not a party. Just a surprise gathering of some people Rachel knows. Um, this is Phoebe and Chandler and Joey.
Ohhh, you're having a parteee.
Oh, I know, I never wear fake ones. I just did it so my Mom wouldn't give me grief about me biting them.
Your nails.
Oh man, they think they are so slick messing with us! But see they don't know that we know that they know! So...
No! Not unless! Look this must end now!
Oh my God! Oh, this is incredible! Ohh! All right, y'know what? I'm just gonna roll right into that office and-and quit!
I guess you can.
Good! Now, take those salads to table 4, And you! Get the swordfish! And you! Get a haircut!
No, it's really good.
Thanks. I'll call you tomorrow. Okay. Okay, let's let the Alan-bashing begin. Who's gonna take the first shot, hmm?
I've heard schho much about all you guyschh!
I don't know, I've never had to use the other one. I'm just saying y'know, if we're having sex, he's not gonna be talking.
What's the other one?
No way, with one pound to go, c'mon. We're workin', we're movin', we're in the zone we're groovin'.
Monica, it's 6:30 in the morning. We're not working out, it's over.
Look Rach, we have to move. I mean if they had lost, we would've made them get rid of the birds. Right?
You can't just ignore the bet! It's a bet! You bet and you bet and if you lose, you lose the bet!
That's right. You're making a commitment and that's the same, whether you do that at the Plaza or, where are you gonna do it?
We, you know, we're different! We don't care about having a huge party. This is really nice for you, but, oh, please, I put this on? And, ow, I look , why, well, radiant. All right, well, who cares, I don't need a pretty veil and a fancy dress.
I'm making a list of all the things that are most likely to go wrong at the wedding. Now, that way I can be prepared.
What 'cha doing Mon?
Y'know what? Y'know when I said that I want you to deal with this relationship stuff all on your own? Well, you're not ready for that.
Yeah, but still, cheap shot!
You're right, you're right I shouldn't freak out. 'Cause this is what will happen when you and I have babies! When will that be?!
Is not as important as the fact that Phoebe took care of the babies all by herself.
Look, maybe this is none of my business, or maybe it is, I don't know... but, uh, I'm kind of worried about you.
Yeah, OK.
Oh my god, where's my purse? No, you know what? I can replace everything in there. Get that binder, and let's go!
I didn't get to the bathroom. I bumped into Owen on the way, and he didn't know he was adopted. And there's a slight chance I may have told him.
Oh no-no-no, not Dr. Burke. Dr. Burke is out of town. The-the on-call doctor will see me now.
Dr. Burke will see you know.
It's not a date, okay. I'm just gonna teach him how to make lasagne for some pot luck dinner he has.
Well, she spent the last six months getting over him, and now she's celebrating that by going on a date with him.
Okay, the realtor said another couple made an offer. Maybe the Janice's won't get it! Maybe the other couple will.
This can not be happening!
I know!! Chip? Hi! It's Monica. 'Kay. 'Kay. Okay. Okay, good-bye. Oh my God, we just had the best conversation!!
Monica, you're so lucky! He's like the most popular guy in school!!
It's easy! Just keep it casual! Give him a kind word, shake his hand and give him the money!
Yes! Santa's coming!
: what means if he gets like a disease or kills someone. not if he gets his jollys to jaws!
man sharks. I always knew there was something weird about that dude. But you promised to love him no matter what.
Are you crazy?! We own those two! I mean look at 'um, he can't breath and she's popping pills.
Let them win one.
Here, let me show you. Okay, the towels are hanging next to the sink, and umm, you can use the fancy soap.
Where can I wash up?
Oh, no. He doesn't have time for that. But if you want, you can go help him and Joey pack up the guest room.
Hey, is Chandler here? We talked about catching a movie.
I've not seen her since high school graduation. Oh my God, that night she got so dru. . . motional.
Yep.
You call eight hours alone with my label maker wasted time? Ooh, now I get to use my shredder!
I don't think I have to hear the rest. Advertising makes perfect sense. Sorry you had to waste all this time, though.
Because I don't have the money or the equipment to handle something that big on such short notice. I mean there's no way.
So, uh, why did you have to turn it down?
Ok, right about now the turkey should be crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside. Why are we standing here?
Yeah, but did they have to shoot him down? I mean, that was just mean.
Listen, I'm sure that dad doesn't care. He probably thought this was funny; he'll be telling this story for years!
Now, I know you wanted to bond with my dad, but did you really have to bond to that part?
Is that why he's acting so weird...? He's jealous...? Oh my God, that is crazy. It's not like I'm attracted to Geoffrey...
Really? Do you not know Chandler?
Well no wait a minute that's not true! No, what did, that was really sweet. And it kinda works out for the best.
Ugh...
I gotta go water Pete's plants. Y'know what, if he's gonna break up with me, maybe I won't water his plants.
He's good with rear things, bring him in too.
Honey, that's okay. I actually know this woman, Nancy, who's a restaurant biz head-hunter. Maybe she'll know of something.
'So Cheesy' also has an opening.
Well, the end table is wrong, The couch looks bizarre and don't even get me started on the refrigerator magnets.
No, I don't see anything different other than the fact that the room got so much brighter when you came into it.
Soon! I-I just couldn't before. You saw how upset Joey got! I couldn't do that to her, she's my best friend!
Okay, when are we gonna tell Rachel what is actually gonna happen?
Well, CHP because I used to have a crush on Eric Estrada. And ZXY becuase I think it sounds zexy.
How come those?
Oh my God! It's true!! Oh my God you are so amazing! Oh my God, can I just ask you to do me oh, just one favor?
Sure. Yep.
No no no, if I couldn't pay you back right away then I'd feel guilty and tense every time I saw you.
Monica, if you want, I can lend you some money.
All right Rachel, you sweep behind, I'll pitch it to you, you throw it down field to Phoebe. All right. Break.
Come on Mon, let her throw the ball.
I had to go all the way to the basement because some idiot keeps stuffing the trash chute with pizza boxes!
Hey, being you is finally gonna pay off!
You are! Hey, here's twenty bucks. -- Why don't you go buy yourself something pretty while I'm at work tomorrow?
Actuary... no. Book-keeper... no. Topless dancer... Hey, d'you know what I just realized? You are the sole wage earner. *You* are the head of the household. I don't do anything - I'm a kept man!
Well umm, we were just talking about the y'know, the Swing Kings and just wondering whether y'know, they were the right way to go.
What are you guys talking about?
No, last time you said it like Dracula, and it scared her! Can I get you anything? You want some more ice chips?
Next time, can I say breathe?
Yes. Uh, yes, I did. That was my friend, Eddie Moskowitz. Yeah, he likes it. Reaffirms his faith.
Did you just say Hi, Jew?
It's so weird, how did Joey end up kissing Charlie last night? I thought you'd end up kissing Charlie.
Can't believe you guys bought that, enjoy your slow death .
Okay, just so you know, I'm gonna be ovulating from tomorrow until the sixth, so don't touch yourself in the next 48 hours.
No, no, no, no! No, no, no, no! It's okay, it's okay. I didn't go. Don't cry, it's just a bit! I'm your uncle Chandler; funny is all I have!
I have like five times, but the guy is so charming, that I go up there to yell and then I end up apologizing to him.
Why don't you go up there and ask him to 'step lightly, please?'
Look, these clowns are trying to take us for a ride and I'm not gonna let 'em! And we're not a couple of suckers!
Yeah.
All right, come on guys, let's go! Tie score, and we're runnin' out of time. Forty-two!! Thirty-eight!! Hike!
Hey! Well, I've been preparing for that my entire life! Or something about you that's mean!
Well it wasn't that many guys. I mean, if you consider how many guys there actually are, it's a very small percentage.
Er, uh, I'm just gonna go. Sorry.
Well, I'm never gonna listen to you again, that's for sure! "Y'know, harm can it do if you go and put your name down?"
What are you gonna do?
Oh, I haven't had that feeling since I first started going out with Chandler. Wow, I'm never gonna have that feeling again am I?
I just like him so much that I just feel like I've had 10 drinks today and I've only had six.
I love you. Hey listen umm, when, when you were talkin' about our future you said cat, but you meant dog right.
I love you so much.
Honey, we were at this beautiful place, and I-I-I just put our names down for fun! I mean, what's the harm in that?
I'm not freaking out. Why would I be freaking out? A woman named Heldi called and said we were getting married, but that happens everyday.
Good? Didn't you hear them...I was great! Thank you so much for making me do this. That's is the best gift ever.
Mon', not that you didn't sound good, but...
Chandler! It happens to lots of guys! You-you-you were probably tired, you had a lot of champagne, don't worry about it!
Let's do it!
Well, I said 'no' to her coming over now! I couldn't say 'no' twice! I get this uncontrollable need to please people!
Why, why, why didn't you just say no!
Well, I don't know... I-It's... just the way you say it... I mean, you're funny... You have that funny thing. You're a funny guy!
What is so funny about that?
He used to lock himself in the basement for hours. No one was every allowed to hear, "The Sound."
Yeah.
And the musicians, look, they can go over here , okay? And the chairs can face this way , and... You go.
Okay? But-but imagine a lot more lights, okay? And-and y'know fewer bricks, and-and-and flowers, and candles...
Honey, uh, this is a picture of the frame guy posing in front of a bright blue screen with a collie.
OK, look, see, this is him. My mother gave me this picture before she died, same guy.
Wait a minute. What about that summer during college that you lived with grandma, and you tried to make it as a dancer?
Uh, I haven't.
Ugh, I guess it got sent to the billing address as opposed to the shipping address. Uh! What a pickle.
Oh my God, what's it doing here?
Yeah and if I had seven, maybe I would've said something like this, "Wow! My boyfriend's such a wise ass-seven!"
The only way that I said six would be if the seven's, let meet at seven, not at six.
Yes there is! He's black and white and shaggy and he's sitting next to Rachel and licking Rachel's hand.
No, there's no dog here?
Not that, this, US. Oh my God, Ross, you-re, you're, it's jus-, you-, ever sin- you been here.
Well, I guess we could tape Entertainment Tonight.
Aww, sweetie, but it's not like you're not gonna have anything. You're gonna have nieces and nephews, and some ways that's even better.
Okay that's even sadder. Look, I know, I know what I got myself into, it's just that now that they're in me it's like, it's like I know them y'know, I mean-I mean, it's just not gonna be easy when these little babies have to go away.
Yeah, she hates all mass produced stuff. She thinks her furniture should have a history, a story behind it.
Phoebe hates Pottery Barn?!
This isn't mine. Hey, this isn't, this isn't my stuff! Ugh, Ross! These are your boxes! Where are my boxes?
Oh, I don't know how that got in there.
Well for your information he happens to be one of the brightest, most sophisticated, sexiest men I've ever been with.
Who's Richard Burke? Doc, Doctor Burke? You have a date with Doctor Burke? Why, why, why should that bother me? I, I love that man, he's like a uh, brother to dad.
Aw, my little nephew. Come here, little one. There's my little baby Ben. Hey, my little boy. Hey, he's not crying.
They, uh, were infected. He wouldn't have made it.
This is not, what I'm wearing. I'm ovulating and Chandler's gonna be home any minute, so I thought we would try before dinner.
Wow, so glad I changed. Almost wore my ??? outfit that can't contain my breasts.
Come on Rach, when a guy says he's going to call, it doesn't mean he's going to call. Hasn't it ever happened to you?
To her face? Look it's the end of the date, I'm standing there, I know all she's waiting for is for me to say 'I'll call her' and it's just y'know, comes out. I can't help it, it's a compulsion.
Used to work with her. Used to! I'm a relative and I didn't get invited! A blood relative! Blood!!
Oh, I used to work with Frannie.
Hey, Rach! I made a pile of your stuff over on this side of the room. If you could just......throw your purses at it.
Well, it's just that maternity clothes are so expensive.
Huuh, alright, Danny Arshak, ninth grade. Oh, c'mon Rach, you know the bottle was totally pointing at me.
Not uh, not to my recollection.
Ours is so much better! This living room is smaller, the dining room looks like a cave! What a hole!
It feels like we're cheating on our house. And if we're gonna cheat, shouldn't it be with like a hot, younger house, that does stuff that our house won't do?
Umm, excuse me, we switched apartments. You can't eat are food anymore, that-that gravy train had ended.
Hey!
Don't get too cocky! Remember I won the last one! Oh, by the way, how did that feel, losing to a girl?
Game, point!
Okay. All right, turkey. Eh, that won't work. Cheese? That won't work. Olive loaf? I hope that won't work.
Have at it.
Ok, these were unbelievably expensive, and I know he's gonna grow out of them in like, 20 minutes, but I couldn't resist.
You're welcome.
Noo!! The point is that is was you that was there that night! It is you that I am marrying! It is you that I feel in love with!
Oh, it's not important? It's not important?! If it wasn't for a bride's maid you'd be marrying him not me!
Why?! To celebrate your relationship! To solidify your commitment! To declare your love for one another to the world!
Yeah, well... Y'know, it just got me thinking though, why would anybody ever want to get married huh?
Oh my god. We're trying to get pregnant so he's probably starting to freak out about the fact that my body is going to change.
I don't know! I mean, what brought that on?
She has a better chance of sprouting wings and flying up your nose than you do of not making fun of us.
Maybe your resolution is to not make fun of your friends, especially the ones who may soon be flying you to Europe for free on their own plane.
What are you being such a weenie for? So he has a Barbi, big deal. You used to dress up like a woman.
Look, G. I. Joe's in, Barbi's out. And if you guys can't deal with it, that's your 'too bad.'
Oh, hey handsome! Oh, I'm gonna love you so much that no woman is ever gonna be good enough for you! Oh, we are so lucky!
Well, that's spongy.
Alright, wait a second, why would Ross tell everyone in your class that you are as... "gay as the day is long"?
There you go sweetie... This isn't over.
Oh, I'll have an espresso. Oh acutally, I'll get it. If I ask you to, you'll probably end up drinking it yourself.
Does anybody need anything?
All right Rach, for what it's worth, I think that you're doing great. I mean y'know let's face it, no one handles this well.
Get out, get out of my apartment.
No sweetie, you've got to win over the guy that controls C.H.E.E.S.E.! You've got to kiss some serious robot ass!
Thanks, but I kinda have a problem to deal with here.
No, a doctor of meat. Of course he's a real doctor. And he's handsome, and he's sweet, and know you'd like him.
A real doctor?
Hi. Hi, uh, yes, this is Monica Geller. Um, I believe I'm taking some classes with you and I was wondering what they were.
Hey.
Ok, so I think I'm just about done here, unless you have any bad stuff hidden somewhere, like... porn or cigarettes?
Celebrity.
I don't need an actual man, just a couple of his best swimmers. And there, there are places you can go to get that stuff.
That, that's what's stupid.
So, maybe I am a little high maintenance. And maybe Rachel is a little bit of a pushover. But you know what we decided you are?
Okay.
We left Joey alone with the food! Yep! Yep, I knew it! There he is... feeding stuffing to a dog!
What?
I cannot believe that I just spent the last two days trying to figure out the recipe and it was in my cupboard the whole time!
Yes!! Ohh.
Mom says it's all of Manhattan, parts of Brooklyn and Queens, and they have no idea when it's coming back on.
Wow, this is so cool, you guys. The entire city is blacked out!
Joey, what's it like on a movie set, huh? Do you have a dressing room? Do you have a chair with your name on it?
Aw, come on! It'll be years before I forget you!
Oh, um, around 8:02. We ah, talked for a little while, and then um, we went out for an innocent burger.
When did this happen?
No, Ross, we do not hate Emily. We-we just, we just think that you're having to sacrifice a whole lot to make her happy.
Nooo!!
Chandler that's crazy! If you give up every time you'd have a fight with someone you'd never be with anyone longer than-Ohhh!
Because of the weekend, we had a fight.
Okay, look, this is probably for the best, y'know? Independence. Taking control of your life. The whole, 'hat' thing.
I helped!
I know, he's too charming, but if you two start going out, then it's just gonna make it so much harder for me to hate him.
Well, he's very charming.
Dad, please don't pick your teeth out here! Alright, and if you're gonna put your feet up, why don't you sit on the-
Alright, alright, now-now who should I say tricked me into doing it?
You know what? I don't care. I like it like this, and I'm gonna keep it. You're just jealous because your hair can't do this... OUCH!
Again, let's journey back... As I recall what Rachel said, was she had never notice the shape of your skull before. And Joey... Well, Joey didn't realise that there was anything different.
Look! You knew this about me when you married me! You agreed to take me in sickness and in health. Well, this is my sickness!
But...
All right, I've got a whole bunch of uh-uh, stuff in this area, but umm, I'm getting the feeling that you don't want to deliver.
Monica!
Thats not how you see me, is it? Phoebe while cutting a sweet potatoe in the air: No you're all about the fun.
Yeah and we'd want to make sure Emma has someone like Monica who is more uh. uh discliplinarin.. someone who can be firm and strict.
Okay, Ben, I won't tell your daddy that you had ice cream for dinner, if you don't tell about our little bonking incident.
Okay. If you're alive you answer your phone!
I don't know, how about the idiot who thought he could drive from Albany to Canada on a half a tank of gas!
Oh, who should I blame? The nice bell man who had to drag out luggage to 10 different rooms?
Y'know, no point in dragging it out. Dragging out the long process of you moving out and us not living together anymore.
Okay!
Yeah, once again, I am sorry. Thank you. Bye. I just had to turn down a job catering a funeral for sixty people.
It's gotta be better than that book. Oo! Like a crossbow!
Well... That's not the only time this was an issue. You remember when umm, you spent Thanksgiving with us? You called me fat.
Look I know it was a stupid reason to break up with somebody, but I was 15!
Oh, well. Now that I'm here I might as well help you with the cleaning and organizing! Just happen to have my label maker!
Yeah.
Umm, I'd love too! Ooh, I love macaroni and cheese. I love-I love the way this box feels against my cheek.
Monica, I was wondering if you can make me some of that righteous mac and cheese like last year.
This is where I thought the barca lounger could go! You see you could see the TV and it's still walking distance to the kitchen.
Oh my God! Someone's killed Square Man!
Hello? Chandler, what's wrong? Oh my God, are you alright? Yeah, I'll be right there. I'm so sorry, but Chandler was in a car accident.
Yeah well, in America you're just an "ass".
Ohhh! Let me see! Oh God, I can't believe this! They're an hour late and they're just staying out there, talking!
They're out there!
Sounds smart and healthy to me. So um, just out of curiosity, um, do you currently have any other racquetball buddies?
Absolutely, this will just be something we do, like racquetball.
You know, I know that things could still go wrong but if they don't? If this works out, we're gonna have a baby Chandler, a baby!
So we're standing firm on the 'not getting our hopes up'?
I just don't think arcade games go in the beautiful guest room. The beautiful guest room is gonna be filled with antiques.
So, that's it?
: Joey I am not going to objectify woman with you but if her face is as nice as her ass woah mamma.
Hey, this girl won't turn around and I can't tell whether she's hot or not, what do you think?
Listen, uh, you told me something that was really difficult for you. And I, I-I figured if you could be honest, then I can to.
You know, you read about it, you see it in the movies. Even when you practice it at home, man oh man, it is nothing like that.
Joey, you know, maybe your just not used to kissing men, maybe you just tensed up a little, maybe that's what you need to work on.
Then I don't know what it is. What's the problem?
Okay, I think that's it. The seating chart is done. This is our wedding. They all look like they're having fun don't they?
Stop picturing it!!
That tape was never meant to be seen by... Joey I would feel more comfortable if I was having this conversation in private.
Whoho ho... Listen to the judgement from the porn star!
Ahh, Pete, the other day when you said you needed to talk, umm, just so I know, is it good news or bad news.
Hi, how ya doing?
Okay, if you need the vacuum, it's in my closet on the left-hand side. Ah, the garbage bags are next to the refrigerator...
There it is.
Hi Amanda! Actually now... it's... is not a good time. Dinner tomorrow night? Ok, Phoebe and I will see you then!
I get pedicures!
I give good massages! I used to give them to Rachel all the time before she got allergic! And-and-and Chandler loves them! Watch!
As a masseuse and a human, I'm begging you, never do that to anyone!
Naaaa... He still kills me. Last night he had me laughing so hard, I swear... a little pee came out.
Did that guy really make that joke?
Y'know what? I am really tired of your bellyaching! Okay, I-I worked really hard at making this a nice place for us to live!
Monica, you don't even have a bed, you sleep in a ball on the floor!
It's just... It's hard enough not seeing you during the week, but for Christmas... alright, if this is what you have to do, I understand.
I'm sorry, I won't be here.
Nononononono. Think who you're dealing with here. I mean, I'm not like you. I-I can't even stand in front of a tap class.
There's an open call for Cats. I'm thinking we go down there, sing Memories and make complete fools of ourselves. Whaddya say?
Okay? Over here we have pink suede, which is nice. But umm, if it gets wet then you know it's gonna shrink.
Ah.
Rachel if you, if you want to go out with him, you can. Sound like a big jerk to me but if that's what you want to do...
He just kept asking, and asking, and asking, and asking, and asking, and asking.
Honey! Do you know that none of that stuff came from me?! I mean I never said I wanted to have babies and get married right now!
Yeah, I'm kinda wishing everyone wasn't here right now.
Ohh, of course we are! We left it up to fate. If we were supposed to get married there would be a clear-cut sign.
Yeah. We're doing the right thing, right?
Look honey, I wanted you to hook up with Ross as much as you did. But he's with her now and you're just gonna have to get over it.
Ooh, Julie's so smart, Julie's so special.
Money is so impersonal. Cookies says someone really cares. . . Alright, we're broke, but cookies do say that.
You gave him cookies?
Yeah, well I don't think it really counts if you have to read them off the back of your hand after you fall asleep on the couch.
You get your messages!
You may be okay about getting hurt, but I am not okay with being the one who hurts you. That's why I can't take this job.
Look, the only who stands to get hurt is me. And I'm okay with that.
Oh yeah, I remember mine! Ohh, it was my sixth birthday, my dad took me to the park, I got it, and...it bent.
His first big kid's bike, this is so exciting!
Ya know, I was thinking. Ya know how we always stay at your apartment? Well, I thought maybe tonight we'd stay at my place.
Um, we should go too, I got patients at 8 in the moring.
Why don't you just weigh out the good stuff about the relationship against the bad stuff. I mean that's what I did when I first weighing stuff.
Y'know, maybe she is too young for me. Y'know, when I was over there and she was running around with her friends, I felt like I was a baby-sitter. I finally started to see what you guys were talking about. I don't know what to do.
Mom already called this morning to remind me not to wear my hair up. Did you know my ears are not my best feature?
How we doing, you guys ready?
Who da wenny-Benny boy? You the Wenny-wenny-Benny-Benny boy, yes. Don't cry. Don't cry. Why is he still crying?
Hi, it's me. Listen, Bob. I'm probably way out of line here. I mean, It has been 3 years, and you're probably seeing someone else now, but if we could just have one night together, just for old time's sake, one hot, steamy, wild night...
He cannot play at our wedding! I mean everyone will leave! I mean come on, that is just noise! It's not even a song!
Why is your family Ross?!
Okay, I have to get that. Now when I get back, I want you and your friends to be gone. Thanksgiving is over. The Vein has spoken.
Nice!
Well he is! Yeah, I mean marriage is all he talks about! My goodness, in fact, I'm the one that's making him wait!
Okay that's fine, I'll walk away. And I'll never bother you again, but only if you tell me Chandler's willing to give you everything I am.
Now everybody knows the basic erogenous zones. You got one, two three, four , five, six, and seven!
Look, you don't have to draw an actual wo-whoa! She's hot!
He's great! I mean we have such a good time together! He's so funny, and sooo sweet, and I'm not attracted to him at all!!
Mr. Millionaire, new from Snooty Playthings! Third wife sold separately.
I'm not really here. Just thought I'd drop these off...on the way.. my way... Do you come here a lot? Without me?
Nothing, I just thought I'd stop by.. y'know, after the uh... that I.. y'know, so what are you doing here?
I mean I-I thought you were nuts at first, but you-you did it. And now you can just look back at this thing with no regrets.
It would be nice after hearing 20,000 people chant "You suck!"
Well, I just think the baby would keep falling off the dog. Do you, uh, do you , do you not see kids in our future.
You really need the bassinet?
Okay, all right, I think you're great, I think you're sweet, and you're smart, and I love you. But you will always be the guy who peed on me.
Okay. All right.
I wanna buy 5 shares of SGJ and I wanna buy them now. C'mon time is money my friend. Thank you. Wooo.
Uhh, I'm guessing the threshold's clear now.
How can you smoke in this day of age? Do you not seen that ad with a little kid walks to grandpa, it's chilling.
One really does have a stick up one's ass. Doesn't one?
Chandler! Everyone--no one's eating my Tuscan finger food 'cause they're all filling up on Phoebe's snow cones!
Awesome!
Honey, you can relax. Last night at work, Geoffrey told this really sexist joke. After that, not so funny anymore.
Well, I'm off to Tulsa, so if your Maitre D. friend has any funny Oklahoma jokes, tell him to e-mail me at www.hahanotsomuch.com.
I am really an idiot. you see, I was filling out my friend's form, and instead of putting her information, I put mine.
Why?
Is that that couple on the first floor? Because we should get a baby before them. Yeah! That guy tried to sell me drugs.
You know, I... I feel like I've been here before. Are any other couples in the building adopting?
I'd rather hang out with a sniveling work weasel guy when I can be hanging out with my boyfriend who I actually respect.
So I laugh at my boss's jokes, what's the big deal?
Aww, the only reason you want to go out with me because my blond wig, and the big boobs, and the fact that I serve you food.
Hmm, come on, you just said to her that you....
Oh, I still can't believe my dad saw us having sex! He didn't make it to one of piano recitals, but this he sees!
Look, we can't stay in here forever.
Y'know what? He will forgive you. And I like to bring a pad with me when I go answer the phone just in case... Okay...
Already? That's pretty bad what you did.
Well, after 15 years of mom and dad keeping it as a shrine to you, it's time the velvet ropes came down.
I can't believe we have to say goodbye to the house we grew up in. Man, some-some stranger's gonna be living in my room.
Okay. Okay, I can't wait! This is going to be the best Valentine's Day ever! I can't believe it! Make the presents! Make the presents!
Of course, of course not. I just have to uh, go over to the place where I-I made it and pick-pick it up.
So why-why wasn't Ross's stuff ruined? And if you say the words medical marvel I'm going to Easy Bake your head!
I'm afraid so.
Look, there's Chandler. You knew, that stupid friend of Ross'. Said I'm fat. You know I've already lost 4 pounds!
I know. But if some guy who looks like Corey Haim wants to kiss me tonight, I'm sooo gonna let them!
Yeah. But a part of me also can't wait 'til it's over. Chandler and I have this pact not to have sex again until the wedding.
Hey the wedding is so close! Are you getting nervous?
I'm gonna miss this hand! Okay I know it's a lot to ask, but oh my God Chandler, this is a once in a lifetime opportunity.
And you're thinking of taking it? So before you said being me with me was more important than any job, but I guess now it's old job, me, new job.
It's not ok to do it in a doctor's office but it is ok to do it in a parked car behind a Taco Bell?
It's weird! In a doctor's office?
Well, because you signed it baby kangaroo Tribbiani . Hey, why don't you stop worrying about sounding smart and just be yourself!
Why not?
Yeah, and y'know, if you could not mention to them that we live together, that would be great! , I was thinking we would eat around four.
Oh! That's great, they haven't seen the place since I moved in!
Good! Now I need you to be careful and efficient. And remember, if I am harsh with you, it is only because you are doing it wrong.
Yeah.
Oh, sure it does! In high school, you weren't jealous at all even though all your girlfriends were cheating on you!
It does not!
Oh it's not big, not at all, you know, kinda the same lines as, say, oh I don't know, having a third nipple.
I didn't know it was a big secret.
When Mom and Dad drove you to the hospital to get your nose fixed, I swam into the lake and fished it out.
Okay, where in the hell did you get that?!
Guys can fake it? Unbelievable. The one thing that's ours! Besides, why would you fake it when we're trying to have a baby?
Oh yes you can. You just make the faces and the noises.
We're moving in a couple of days and we've got a lot of packing to do. It would be great if you guys could pitch in.
I thought I was going home to go to bed, but I'm sensing there's something less fun for me to do here.
An era is defined as a significant period of time. Now, it was significant to me, maybe it wasn't significant to you!
Oh, all right. But y'know I gotta say, I don't, I don't think six years counts as an era.
I don't know it! I want to have a kid with you because I think you're going to be an amazing dad... at the fun parts and the hard parts.
Yeah, but its not who I am. Everything they said was exaclty why I was worried about having a kid. And its true. And look everybody knows it.
Oh my God, I can't believe what I'm getting ready to say. I wanna have a baby, but I don't wanna have one with someone who doesn't really wanna have one.
But you're not.
What if it's new? I mean, we agreed not to talk again, unless we had something really important to say. Shouldn't I call him back?
It's old, it's definitely old. Didn't you hear the, the double beep?
Okay, I got it. Phoebe? All right, you pull. I'm gonna spread the legs as wide as I can. Joey? Now is not the time!
All right, hold on! Okay, let's just all think.
Yes! Carol and Susan's caterer had a mountain bike accident this weekend, and she's in a full body cast.
It really hit me last night. I'm gonna be on Days of our Lives. And then I started thinkin' about all of u, and how these are the days of our lives..
Forget the bubblewrap! There isn't time! Rachel starts messing up Amy's hair: Frizzy frizzy frizzy frizzy!!
Alright. Thats it!
Chandler, we have talked about this. You are not supposed to give people advice! Now couldn't you just have made some sort of inappropriate joke?
Be-cause, we were talking about ways that he could beat Mike and I told him that Phoebe wanted to get married.
White House adviser? Clinton's campaign guy? The one with the great hair, sexy smile, really cute butt?
Hello? Who are we spying on?
Ohh... Oh, that's okay I hate when people come back to complement the chef. Like I have nothing better to do! So what's up?
Actually, I'm not here to complement the chef.
Oh wow! Okay. Don't scare me like that okay? I mean for a minute there I was like, "Oh my God! The worst has happened!"
Oh!
No! To take more pictures of all of us together. I mean I really think it's the best resolution because everyone will enjoy the pictures.
What, to blind my child?
And when he's naked I can throw him out in the front yard and lock the door and all the neighbors will just humiliate him!
Yeah.
I'm fine now, but it was really scary there for a while. I mean, someone slipped a-a threatening note under the door.
No! Smokes-A-Lot Lady blew smoke directly into my mouth. Eh-uh-are you okay?
And it has to go perfectly, because if she doesn't like something about us she can keep us off every adoption list in the state.
Kind of. She's coming by to interview us and see where we live.
Hey! Continuing the countdown of your favorite meals. Tonight, No. 3, macaroni and cheese with cut up hot dogs.
Oh my good God.
The days and nights are hard! I get it! Okay? Look umm, Rachel I'm sorry! I have to start getting ready! I'm getting married today!
The nights are the hardest. But then the day comes! And that's every bit as hard as the night. And then the night comes again...
Sure! If you're just gonna hang out as friends, then maybe I'll join ya. You know, I'm your friend and Mike's friend .
Not if nothing happens. Why can't... why can't we just hang out as friends?
I'm not going to be a part of this! You can't just bring some random guy at home and expect him to be our sperm donor!
I'm telling you, he's great! I mean, even if my sperm worked fine, I'd think he'd be the way to go!
No, those first two windows, that's the lobby. And y'know the other one over there, that's the stairway. You've been counting wrong.
No. No. No. She lives on the third floor, eighth apartment from the left.
Oh, and I can also speak a little French. Voulez-vous coucher avec moi ce soir? Why? What did I say?
Yeah, little change in plans. Ahh, we're gonna break-up instead.
Gee, I don't know Rach. Order up!! I got a Yentel soup, a James Beans, and a Howdy hold the Dowdy!
Oh, I wanna quit, but then I think I should stick it out, then I think why would such a person stay in such a demeaning job, just because it's remotely related to the field they're interested in.
All right, I'm out of oven space. I'm gonna turn on Joey's. Please, watch him! Do not let Joey eat any of the food!
46. Wow! Who's well educated now, Mr. I-forgot-ten-states?
Y'know, I think if I were going to be with a woman. It'd, it'd be with someone like Michelle, she was so oh, she was so petite.
Yeah.
Oh wait, you know what, I got it, I got it, pretend like you just woke up, okay, that will throw her off. Be sleepy.
Hello!
I'll be coordinator! Oh my God! I'm so sorry, I didn't get you anything! Okay, look everybody has to help! Okay? You can help, can't you Phoebe?
No, no don't get mad because look-this is what happened. So I-I started packing, then I realized, "What am I doing? I am lousy at packing!" Right? But you love packing! So, as a gift to you, on our last night, ta-da!
You sat back and let him have her, you didn't fight at all. Am I right? Do you want the same thing to happen with Emily?
I made fun of his accent.
Thanks. Like, check out my new catering stuff. Look at this! I'm an omelet station! Omelet? Made to order!
Mon! I'm so happy for you!
Hey Rach, what about this? Huh? Who-who gets this? See, I don't know if I want it because it might be y'know, too many memories!
Okay.
Oh, my mom called, they're gonna run our engagement announcement in the local paper, so we're looking for a good picture of us.
What are you guys doing?
All right, all right. Maybe I can fit them in if I just do some rearranging. But uh, Rachel may actually have to sit at the bar!
Well this is just sad!
Ok, all right. It was an accident, I swear, all right. I was putting on my jacket, and the thing, and the lamp, and it broke.
I am. Let me just get my coat.
But, you see, it's just... this night has to go just perfect, you know? And, well, Wendy's more of a... professional waitress.
But, but?
I figured out I need to charge seventeen bucks a jar just to break even. So, I've got a new plan now. Babies.
Well, what happened to your jam plan?
Rachel you have to read this book. It's called Be Your Own Windkeeper. It's about how women need to become more empowered.
Woah, woah, woah, what book is this?
Oh...Phoebe? Maybe I wasn't clear before. I really love listening to your music here, but my restaurant is sort of an upscale place.
Here, Monica, look what I got to wear when I play at the restaurant uh, huh wait! Right? I mean, this might even class up the ballad of the uncircumcised man.
That's what we used to call your ah, your motorcycle in high school. Y'know how a motorcycle is a Chopper, and you're Chip. Nevermind.
The what?
It's weird, but you know what I don't wanna throw this away. I mean this is like all I have left of him, gross, drain hair. Ooh!
Getting it away from me would be job one.
I'm on top of the world, looking down on creation and the only explanation I can find, is the wonders I've found ever since...
What? Ow!
I know! Now look, there's only one problem though. There's only room for one, so I guess one of you will have to stay at Joey's.
Oh my God! It sure didn't look this way when I lived here.
Okay! It's time for dinner. Everyone we're using our fancy china.. um and its very expensive so please be careful.
This guy? Seriously? Later in the day.
And, well, don't you have a lot of wild oats to sew? Or is that what you're doing with me? Oh my God, am I an oat?
Right, and...
Ha, ha, very funny, very funny. But I think we'd like to give poker another try. Shall we, ladies?
Oh yes, yes, we could play some other game... like, uh, I don't know... Pictionary?
Well, if you think about it, I am kind of like a Reverend. I mean, as a chef, I serve God, by feeing the hungry and poor.
She likes Doctor Chandler and Reverend Monica.
All right, Chandler can make boxes, Ross can wrap, and Joey can lift things. Now Phoebe, go tell the guys they have to help out!
That's right.
When we found out that we're gonna get this baby, Chandler and I started talking and we decided that we didn't want to raise a kid in the city.
Are you serious?
Wait a minute, why don't you just call Mark. I mean, who says you have to sit here and wait for him, you've got to make stuff happen.
No, I'm genuinely sorry the Mark thing didn't work out. Look, Rach, I want only good things for you.
Great! Well Rachel, the reason why I won't let you drive the Porsche is because you're a terrible driver. There! That wasn't about the wedding.
Okay, I can fix this! Okay Monica, Rachel thinks all you can talk about is the wedding.
That's a good question. Look umm, last night we let the dice decide. Maybe we should leave it up to fate again. I love you!
So where are we on the whole going back to the place where they have all the marriages thing? I love you.
Alright, let me ask you this question: How many of you thought the music was fine, but not in keeping with the tone of the restaurant? .
Ok, ok, how many of you enjoyed the music outside? Ha!
When girls hang out, we don't have pillow fights in our underwear. I'm sorry. We do. We do. I don't know why I said that.
You know when guys hang out they don't just drink some beer and hammer up drywall?
You're just new at this, it'll get better, think about your first day at work. I mean, that couldn't have been easy but you figured that out.
Oh god what am I gonna do you guys, I can't even comfort my own baby! I'm the worst mother ever!
All right people, we're in trouble here. We've only got 12 hours and 36 minutes left. Move, move, move!
Oh.
Yeah, I'm sure your ex-wife will be more than happy to move to another country so you can patch things up with your new wife.
I bet if I talk to Carol and Susan I can convince them to move to London with Ben.
Well, I don't care! That-that turkey has to feed 20 people at my parent's house and they're not gonna eat it off your head!
I can't! It-it's stuck!
I know, I know. I'm just so tired of-of missing him. I'm tired of wondering why hasn't he called. Why hasn't he called!
Monica, you broke up with him for a reason.
That's good, have a seat. Um, the doctor says it's gotta be a needle. You're just gonna have to be brave, ok? Can you do that for me?
Ohhh.
He didn't die. I saw his daughter last week. Said he was fine. Her on the other hand, botched Botox.
Ross said he died.
Hey, see that snippy guy over there? He's the one who decides who gets up on the platform. We should go dance by him.
We know!
Okay, we've been out here for two hours and we haven't seen any stupid comets. Can we go now? I mean, Chandler's getting chilly.
Check out the rack on this chick!
You would not. I can't believe this. I hate this, you're too normal. I can't believe my boyfriend doesn't have a thing. My boyfriend doesn't have a thing.
Boy I would just uh, I would freak out.
Okay, okay, I'm sure that Rachel came home early and picked up Emma. You go look across the hall, and I'll call her cell.
Don't ask me, I was in there canoodling you!
Okay, the reason why I asked you guys out to brunch today is because I have been doing some thinking about who should be my maid of honor.
We'll just see.
That's because their nerves are probably deadened from being so stupid. But hey, y'know if you don't believe me, please, by my guest.
Huh, well, the girls in the satin nighties on the commercial don't seem to think it's that bad.
Great! Umm, well what-what I was doing in Chandler's room is that umm, I was cleaning it! In fact, he pays me to clean it!
Yeah!
Look at these authentic fake medals. I tell ya, mom's gonna be voted best dressed at the make-believe military academy.
Yeah?
Y'know I used to go out with this guy that was a really light sleeper, and whenever I started to snore, he would just roll me over...
Yeah, they do! Quit being a baby and leave me alone! There, you've just had your first class!
Yeah, well, I'm using noise. Okay. All right! So, is everybody ready? Here we go. I hear something! I hear something! Where is it?
Y'know, you-you also could've used uh, lamps and then followed the light.
Is it me? Is it like I have some sort of beacon that only dogs and men with severe emotional problems can hear?
Oh no, don't hate, you don't want to put that out into the universe.
I mean I have not been picked on this much since kindergarten and they had to bring in someone from junior high to do the see-saw with me.
Hey, honey! What's the matter? Fine, I was just trying to be nice! Whoa!
What's to know? Buy sell, high low, bears bulls... Yes Manhattan...yeah telephone number of the stock...selling store.
Monica, what are you talking about? You don't know the first thing about the stock market.
Why don't you phase it out? Yeah, fade the accent out and people will think you're, y'know, that you're adjusting to life in America.
Well...
Paolo, I really hate you for what you did to Rachel, but I still have five of these, so heat it at 375 until the cheese bubbles.
Oh, ok bye-bye.
Oh my god. Today's the sixth?! I may be done ovulating! I may have also served some very questionable meat at the restaurant.
Yes, it's also 2003.
Or, it could mean that-that you saw Chandler and me together and we y'know were being close and stuff and then you just want to have that with someone too.
That kinda sounds like your dream dude.
I wish we at least knew his name... Look at that face. I mean, even sleeping, he looks smart. I bet he's a lawyer.
Maybe nobody's tried this.
Come on! Come on, if we have sex again it'll double our chances of getting pregnant. Do you think that closet's still available?
Honey, we've been over this. I need to be facing the other way.
Noo!! It's driving me crazy. I mean every other way he's like the perfect guy, he has everything. Plus! He actually has everything.
Still?!
A jazz trio for cocktails. The Bay City Rollers for dancing. Wait, that was from my sixth grade wedding.
Aw.
I don't know. Look he's a great guy and I love being with him but... you know. Things happen, and they happen. You don't plan these things.
Could tonight be the Night?
You actually broke her watch? Wow! The worst thing I ever did was, I-I shredded by boyfriend's favorite bath towel.
That's one way! Me, I- I went for the watch.
Okay, everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor. This is everybody, this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my brother Ross?
Oh God Monica hi! I just went to your building and you weren't there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are, you are!
I'll get everybody else , finally we can start celebrating my- I'm sorry, uh apparently I've opened the door to the past.
Okay.
Joey they're not real. I start miles beneath the surface of these things, ok, they're fake. See honk honk.
Alright. If you guys don't want it to be special, fine. You can throw any kind of party you want.
Well, um, look I-I don't want this to come our wrong, but ah, you seem awfully confident for a guy I just told I wasn't attracted too.
I know I'm no John Bon Jovi, or someone who find attractive, I'm just, I think, y'know, that you might end up feeling differently.
Alright here's something, it says to try holding the baby close to your body and then swing her rapidly from side to side.
Well, alright, we already tried feeding her, changing her, burping her, oh try this one! Go back in time and listen to Phoebe!
Sit down. All right? Please, just listen to me. You are terrible at this! Okay? You are the worst ultimate fighter ever! Ever!!
I can't until I'm the ultimate fighter. I will do it. I'm telling you, the day will come when children will argue over who will win a fight, me or Superman. Now, I'm not saying I could beat Superman, but y'know, kids are stupid.
I mean, who knows how long it's gonna take for someone else to give us a baby? What if, what if no one ever picks us?
I know..
No! No you should! A lot of major actors do nude scenes! I mean the chance to star in a movie? Come on!
You're right. Maybe I shouldn't even go on the call back.
Oh God! Orange juice just came out of my nose, but it was totally worth it. Oh my God, I completely forgot about your sound.
Yeah, just a little in high school, but then I really got into it in college. I mean that's-that's when I really found my sound.
Yeah, but he wants to talk to you before anything really happens with her. And as his friend, I mean, don't you think he deserves the same from you?
Well, he's with Charlie now.
Yeah. Anyway, he told me about your apartment. And, um, I couldn't sleep, thinking about it. So, uh, would it be okay if I cleaned it?
Oh, yeah. Oh, you know, that's too bad that didn't work out.
Terrible. If-if I want something done right, I have to do it myself. Other people just wreck stuff. I really think I might kill someone tonight.
Hey Mon, how's it going?
Well, she actually has a boyfriend y'know herself, named Clark. Uh, she also kinda invited herself to our wedding. Clark too.
Right.
I'm making cookies for Erica. And oh, by the way, we have to leave for the airport soon, her plane comes in about an hour.
Why are you wearing my apron?
Oh yeah! I saw her walkin' it down the street the other day. She had uh, these flowers in the basket. It was so cute.
Phoebe really likes the bike huh?
We're not gonna have sex! Okay, nothing's changed here. He still doesn't want children and I still do, so that's why we're just gonna be friends.
Well, you might wanna make a little extra, y'know you'll probably be hungry after the sex.
I'm his sister, okay? I love him! I don't want to see him get hurt! Come on! Doesn't that give me the right to control him-help him?
Noo! Oh no! No! God no! He should not get back together with her. I know that! You know that! Even Ross knows that! But that still doesn't give us the right to erase his message!
If we wanna get on camera, I think we have to get up on one of those platforms. They've been taping those people up there all day.
Why do they keep doing that?
Of course I wouldn't approve, I mean, you were totally in love with this guy who, hello, was gay. I mean, what the hell were you thinking?
I'm sorry Monica but I knew if I told you, you'd get really, like, judgemental and you would not approve.
Uh-huh, but I'm sure you can handle this. I mean, I have won awards for my organizational skills, but, uh, I'm sure you'll do fine.
Wow, this is a lot!
Good morning, Tiger! I'm making you a nice big breakfast so you can keep up your strength for tonight. You're gonna get me good and pregnant.
Hey!
Really Phoebs? Because, you know, you'd have to be an actual waitress. This can't be like your 'I can be a bear cub' thing.
Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. See Phoebe, Phoebe.
So what, he's a little older, big deal, I mean he's important to me. Ya know if you ask him, he might take you on his Jag.
I don't know, Richard's really nice and everything, uh, it's just that we don't know him really well, ya know, and plus he's, ya know, old -er than some people, but, uh, younger than some buildings.
I'm getting married today!!! I think I just cracked a rib. But I don't care because today's my wedding day! My day is finally here!!
Okay. Well there's one down.
Really? But tomorrow night is the only night I get off from the restaurant. If you go to the game, we won't have a night together for another week.
Joey just called. He's got courtside Knicks tickets for him and me tomorrow night.
Okay, just to be clear comedy with the plates will not be well recieved. Ross makes some sort of sound to let us know it hurt.
Woah. Woah... Woah.
Groomsman, groomsman, why are you just standing there, where is your bridesmaid? We've got a broken arrow. Bridesmaid down! Oh, that's me.
It's the dog.
"Tonight's the night we're gonna make it happen, tonight we'll put all other things aside. Give in thistime and show me some affection..."
All right, watch!
Well I'm not sure yet, but umm of the top of my head I'm thinking double sided tape and some sort of luncheon meat.
Like what?
No!! Why didn't you make a copy and-and keep it in a fireproof box and keep it at least a hundred yards from the original?!!
I just went to my old apartment to get you the-the cookie recipe and the stupid fire burned it up!
Hey. It's three in the morning. They don't know that I've come home yet. You notice how neither one of them are wondering where I am.
Whoa-ho-ho! Yeah, okay.
That is a wonder. So tell me something, Mom. If you had to do it all over again, I mean, if she was here right now, would you tell her?
I'm telling you, it's a wonder your mother turned out to be the positive, life-affirming person that she is.
Oh look, the pool table's free. Rack 'em up. I'll be back in just a minute. Get ready for me to whip your butt.
Oh yes, and that's what I want a roommate that I can walk around with and be referred to as the funny one.
Here. Ben, do you wanna play the airplane game, do you wanna show Rachel? Come here. We're gonna do something fun. Okay. Weee!! Weee!!
Look Benny, spoon. Spoon. Come on! All right, y'know what I think he's bored.
Okay! The movers will be here in 11 hours. Rachel has not packed. Now, everybody has to help! Chandler, we're gonna start with...
Hurry! Monica's gonna make you pack! She's got jobs for everyone! Now, it's too late for me, but save your selves!
No, no, no. They say it's the same as the distance from the tip of a guy's thumb to the tip of his index finger.
Nah, not so much. Alright, now we smoke. Oh.. my.. God.
Oh, it's a great party! Great food. Y'know, most parties it's all chips and salsa, chips and salsa. So umm, what's this?
Hey! What's going on?
Ohh, she's looking down the hall. Oh! She looked right at me! Oh wait, you can't see people through that little hole, can you? Hello!
You want me to take some girl I've never met to the opera so you can go to a club and flirt with some guy, hmm, that-that is a toughie.
Ohh! Umm, Phoebe, I kinda need to talk to you about that. Umm, well I-I-I think it might be time for me to take a step back from catering.
Okay, is this the day of good news or what? I got us a job! The wedding reception.
Fine! Don't be my friends! I'll buy new friends! Yeah, and then I'll pay for their plastic surgery so they'd look just like you!
All right, believe me.If you win the lottery, it's the last you're gonna hear from us!
Oh yeah, she didn't hire me out of pity, it wasn't so she could pick on me in front of her friends, she actually thinks I'm good.
Okay, I didn't hear that.
Well then, y'know what? I care about you to much to watch you hurt yourself like this. So if you have to do this, then you're gonna have to do it without me.
Y'know I have a torn rotator cuff, a hairline fracture in my right forearm, and a severely bruised Adam's Apple, but that really hurt.
It's so sweet. It really is. It has this big yard that leads down to this stream and then there's these old maple trees...
You put an offer on a house?
Ok, so that's what we're doing. You know, when I'm in the coffee house bopping along to one of your songs, I'm wearing ear plugs.
Well at least all my songs don't taste like garlic. Yeah, there are other ingredients Monica.
Oh, yeah, right! And after I took a shower this morning I just threw my towel on the floor! Oh God, it hurts to even joke about it.
It's all done!
No, no, no. Honey, I'm ok. Shake it off! Oh, no! No shaking, no shaking! Ooh! Ooh! Oh my God! I can't play!
You ok?
Oh no no, this is not for him, this is for me. That way he's still sober but I find his stories about shoelaces much more amusing.
What's going on, is... uh, Bobby drinking again?
YOU BET YOUR ASS I AM! I just had the best first day ever! The kitchen: twice as big as Allessandro's.
Honey, you're screaming.
The second that Ross walks in that door, I want you take him back to your bedroom and do whatever it is that you do that makes him go, rweee!!
Okay.
Of course it was! Trust me, when it comes to psychology I know what I'm talking about. I took two psych classes in college.
Ah! Well it was Joey reading Drake's lines in the dream...
All right then, go fight for her! Go to London! I mean, that could be you and Emily! That, but-but nicer. Just, go to London!
No.
Okay, fine. Let's talk about snow. -- Do you think it's snowing in Tulsa, where my husband is having sex on a copying machine?
Aren't we done with that?
So wait, Ross's stuff is fine, but I have no memories because you wanted to keep the bottom two inches of your car away from water!!!
Well, I used your boxes to divert water away from the Porsche.
Well, he did this bit... You probably had to be there, but it was Liza Minelli locked in our freezer, eating a raw chicken.
Yeah, he came up...
It's gotta be one of a kind. Y'know like umm, y'know uh, what's that God awful ceramic fruit bowl she has on her counter?
Well this has story behind it! I mean they had to ship it all the way from the White Plains store.
No! Y'know, the fantasy! Meet someone from a strange land, fall in madly love, and spend the rest of your lives together.
You had fantasies about Emily?
Oh, well... um, that's all there are of these. But in about eight and a half minutes, we'll be serving some delicious onion tartlets.
Like 'em? I could eat a hundred of them!
C'mon Chandler, I think we have been given an opportunity. I mean, the mistake has already been made. They are writing up the paper right now.
Your Veal Chop is $34,95!
Well, so far I have uh, my bride's maids dresses won't get picked up, my veil gets lost, or I don't have my something blue.
What are they?
Y'know, I really have to tell Rachel, but I... We just have to get it over with! Y'know, the next time we see them we're just gonna tell them. Okay? That's it.
No, no, I keep trying, y'know? I can get out, "Joey, I have too..." but then I lose my nerve and I always finish with, "...go to the bathroom." He may think I'm sick.
Hey guys! You found the presents? Chandler, you let them find the presents? Great! Do you know how long it took me to find you that water purifier?
Fine!
We're Aunt Monica and uncle Chandler, by the way. You may not recognize us, because we haven't spoken to your parents in seventeen years!
Hi Emma! It's the year 2020. Are you still enjoying your nap?
Oh, Rach! Rach! Umm hey, could you do me a favor and would talk to Chandler's dad and try to keep him away from Chandler's mom?
Thanks you guys.
Okay! Very funny! Somebody let me out please?! Come on, I'm cold! And covered in marinara sauce! Come on! Let me out!
Fine!
Myself. Y'know for remembering to pack a thing. Yeah, you do a good thing, you get a check! My mom does it, I never realised it was weird.
Who are you saying "check" too?
I thought I was making headway, everyone was smiling at me all day, I get off work and I find out that they wrote this on my chef's hat.
Oh.
Nooo! Never! I mean, we're living in the moment. God, it is so nice for once to not have to get all hung up on 'Where is this going?'
Come on, like you never talk that.
That is completely untrue. You think I'm high maintenance? Okay, prove it. I want you to make a list and we're going to go through it point by point!
Fine. The reason that I was leaning a little bit more toward Rachel than you is just that you're ... just ... kinda high maintenance-Okay let's go to lunch!
This baby has got everything. Take y'know, locations for instance. First, organized alphabetically, then geographically, then by square footage.
Oh my God, the wedding book?! I haven't seen that since the forth grade!
If you have the big apartment you have to deal with people coming over all the time. That fridge has got to be stocked, okay, that's your department now.
There's gravy?
Uh, look, Larry honey, umm, I wrote the book on Section 5 and I know that you don't have to wear your hat unless you're in the kitchen.
A 98. I deducted 2 points because you are not wearing your chef's hat, and that is a Section 5 violation.
Let me think. Oh, when I was younger I used to dream that I got married to Mayor McCheese, and on our wedding night I ate his head.
Have you ever had any weird romantic dreams?
Well, we're trying to find someone to perform our wedding and they're all either boring or annoying or y'know, can't stop staring at the ladies.
With what?
Hello? Oh, Hi, Ju Hi, Jew! Uh huh? Uh huh? Ok. Um, sure, that'd be great. See ya then. Bye.
My mommies love me. That's clever.
Oh, please, stop! Look, we're supposed to be honest with each other. I-I just wish you could tell me-just say, "I don't like your massages."
Listen, I just wanted to apologize about this afternoon and the whole massage thing. Y'know? I-I really like 'em.
It's worse. The only thing that's getting me through is knowing that I'm gonna be seeing you soon. I think I may even try to get out of here early.
Oh come on, come on, it can't be that bad.
It's not like I want to get married tomorrow! It's just that I-I'd like to believe that I'm in a relationship that's actually going somewhere, that I'm not just wasting my time!
Chandler giving you a hard time huh?
Yeah. In fact, I like her so much you tell her I want my cookies early this year! Y'know, a box of Thin Mints and some Tag-a-Longs.
Well thanks!
Oh, what a great argument, exhaling! All right, y'know what, I'll prove it to you, okay. I'll trade you Joey for Rachel, and I'll still win the game.
You're so pathetic! Why can't you just accept it, we're winning because I'm better than you.
Well, you're... you're different funny... I mean, you're... you're more sarcastic a-a-and... well, he does... bits... and impressions... and... and limericks...
Oh yeah? Is he funnier than me?
Well now, I get to spend my shower with the only people I really love! I mean, I get all those presents without having to talk to people I don't even like!
What do you, what do you mean?
Hey, the point is that he was at everyone of your swim meets and he was there cheering you on! Okay? That's a, that's a pretty great dad.
No-no all kids are embarrassed by their parents, you'd have to come up with a whole new word for what I went through. When I was in High School, he used to come to all of my swim meets dressed as a different Hollywood starlet. Y'know it's hard enough to be fourteen. You're skinny. You're wearing speedoes-That your mom promised that you would grow into! And you look up into the stands and there's your dad cheering you on dressed as Carmen Miranda. We was wearing a headdress with real fruit that he will later hand out to your friends as a healthy snack!
When two people finally realise their feelings for each other, and-and they talk for hours, and they-they learn all about the other person!
What?
Nothing, I'm just trying to recreate some of the fun that we had at my place the other day. Remember, when you picked Rachel over me? That was funny.
Monica, what are you doing?
De-caff. Okay, everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor. This is everybody, this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my brother Ross?
Can I get you some coffee?
Umm, actually I was about to tell you that I was, I was going to get out of it, but hey, if we're just goofing around then uh, maybe I will go out with him.
Oh, is this about you-you dating the nurse? Yeah, Joey already told me, and I am so-so fine. I mean, you and I we're just, y'know, we're nothing, we're goofin' around.
Um, yeah, so uh, uhh, listen, I'm sorry I didn't tell you this before but umm, I, I'm no longer at my job, I, I had to leave it.
C'mon Monica, do it. Hey, you guys, um, Monica has some news.
Could you please tell me what this is in reference to? Yes, hold on. Um, they say there's been some unusual activity on your account.
Oh, God, ask them what they want.
Oh umm, that's because I just wanted to y'know walk in on me and Chandler while we were, y'know, doing it all night. Will you excuse me for just a second?
You're not? Then why did you ask us if we wanted to go?
All right, eight we get married, but 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12 we don't get married.
Yes, we don't get married unless there's a sign! Okay, so say uh, say you roll another eight then there's a definite sign that we should get married.
All right, Rachel's party is in a couple of hours and there's a lot to do. Now, Ross, you got Geller blood, you're in charge of these yahoos!
Jumping on the bed?
Well, you guys have been friends forever. Remember the first time that you kissed Ross? How weird that was? You couldn't stop laughing? You got through that.
I do not know what's wrong with us, I mean, we have kissed before and that's been great! But this time it was leading somewhere and I was very aware of the fact that it was Joey touching me.
Man, this sucks! Y'know if Mom and Dad don't see us on TV after we made them so jealous, I mean, who's gonna be the losers then?
Hey, now you're the one who wet his pants.
Y'know what, I've got to walk out of here right now, 'cause getting over you is the hardest thing that I have ever had to do. I don't think I could do it again.
Okay, okay, one thing's changed. But we still want different things and we know how this is gonna end.
Well, my breasts are going to get bigger weather you like it or not! And you know what? It's not just my breasts. My ass is going to get bigger too.
Argh. fascist.
Honey, we've been trying to have a baby for over a year. I think it's a good idea to find out if everything's ok. Just a few routine tests.
We really need to take those tests?
Look. I'm sure there's some friendly way to reconcile this! Um, have a seat. First of all, we haven't been introduced, I'm Monica Geller.
Yes, but there isn't always time!
You would not believe my day! I had to work two shifts, and then to top it off, I lost one of my fake boobs, in a grill fire.
Sorry. I'm sorry.
What don't you just calm down Phoebe! All right?! Why don't you just get all your facts before you run around telling everybody that you're the only hot couple!!
Okay, you know where you are better than I do. I was just curious.
Why did I 'woo-hoo'? I mean, what was I hoping would happen? That-that he'd turn round and say 'I love that sound, I must have you now'?
I can't believe you did that!
I know! It's just that...ever since high school Rachel was the one person I told everything too. Y'know? I miss that so much now. She's my best friend.
But we're not ready to tell yet!
I think it's totally insane, I mean, they work for the hospital. It's like returning to the scene of the crime. You know, I say we blow off the dates.
Not stupid. The very cute, cute, cute doctors asked us out for tomorrow night, and I said "yes."
Oh, what'd ya bring me?! Awww, hotel toiletries from Japan. Oh, these are gonna go in my permanent collection. You want some coffee?
Well...
Okay. Oh but Joey, come over later because I'm going to teach you to make a bird feeder out of just a pine cone and some peanut butter.
Monica, could you excuse us for a second? I need to talk to the girl with the flowers.
No I totally disagree. No I think it's fine for a guy to do something like that. Such you an actor. Not that you need to,your eyebrows are...
On how far along he's in the sex change process!
Wait a minute! Unless, we give her all gifts she can use after she's done being pregnant. Like-like umm, regular coffee, Tequila.
Oh my God! We are throwing the most depressing baby shower ever!
Exactly. Oh, I love that I can be totally neurotic around you now. Tell me the truth. Don't you like it better now that everything on your desk is perpendicular?
You know, I like the way you have efficiently folded this tab under. See in a tape emergency you could shave valuable seconds off your time.
Ohh, I'm so glad. Thank you so much for staying so calm during this. I mean it's really, it's made me stay calm. I coulda been worse!
Yeah. Y'know I keep thinking that something stupid is gonna come up and I'll go all...Chandler. But nothing has.
Listen umm, I've been thinking, it's not fair for me to ask you to spend all of your money on our wedding. I mean, you work, you work really hard for that.
Hey.
Hello? Oh, hi Wendy! Yeah, eight o'clock. What did we say? Ten dollars an hour?... OK, great. All right, I'll see you then. Bye.
Well.... it is amouz-ing...
This wasn't addressed to Days of Our Lives, this is, this came to your apartment. There's no stamp on it, this woman was in our building.
Ya know, in crazy world, that means you're married.
Y'know what? After you're with this woman for like ten minutes, you forget all that. I mean, she is this astounding person, with this, with this amazing spirit.
What?! Are you insane? This woman stole from you. She stole. She's a stealer.
It's so good, that I feel really selfish about being the only one who's eating it, that I think we should have everyone taste how good it is. Especially Ross.
Really? How good?
All right uh, the important thing is to take your time, you want to hit 'em all, and you mix 'em up. You gotta keep them on their toes.
Well you might if it were anything like 7!
Ya know, my party is fun. I mean, maybe it's a little quieter, less obvious sorta fun but, you know, if people would just give it a chance...
Alright, I'm sorry but these people needed me. They work hard all week, it's Saturday night, they deserve to have a little fun. Go.
What?! Are you crazy? You just had Ross's baby! It's-it's so inappropriate. No, it's worse than that. It's wrong. It's... It is bigger than mine!
Well, I-I said yes.
Anyway, we're really excited about our wedding plans, and well I guess pretty soon we'll be making a big withdrawal from the Monica wedding fund. What?
What?! They wanted a scary story!
Wow, that's a big cable bill! Huh, you don't have a job, but you have no problem ordering porn... on a Saturday afternoon?! I was in the house!
Wa-wa-wa-wait! Congratulations! You did it! You did it! You can relax now. Yeah.
Okay, I gotta go find Rachel but umm, if you guys see her could you please try to give her some really bad news so that mine doesn't seem so bad?
Wow! Big day huh? People moving in, people getting annulled...
Oh, friends first, drunk in London, you know the story. I've got a better question for you: Do you or any of your blood relatives have diabetes?
Okaaay... so eh... so tell me, how did you guys meet.
Okay, here's batch 22. Ohh, maybe these'll taste a little like your grandmother's. This has a little bit of orange peel, but no nutmeg.
Do you want me to learn?!
Well you know it's just like living with a girl. Only they don't steal your makeup. Unless they're playing "This is what my sister would look like"
I know it's so exciting! You know I've never lived with a guy before.
They want me to do it, which is really cool, seeing as I've never catered before, and I really need the money, and this isn't a problem for you, is it?
Yes!
OH GOD NO! Nope, no, no, no. No! No, no. Nope! No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. NO! No!
So you're not friends with him?
Because I know that you think the lottery is "boohaki" but we're all here and gonna watch the numbers and have fun. And you're my brother, and I want you to be a part of this.
Why?
Okay so this is where the band is. And this is where the bar is. And all these pins have people's names on them. And Rach, here you are.
So that's two of my wives.
Ok. Hold on. Geller here! No! I said it has to be there by 4 o'clock. Goodbye. Oh, how hard it is to make an ice sculpture?
Ok.
That was that girl Megan! She booked the Swing Kings on the day of our wedding and said that I couldn't have them back unless I gave her the dress!
What?!
All right, we still have a minute and a half to go, and we're down by two points. Two points.... Phoebe you do a button-hook again. Rachel, you go long.
All right, no, well I want to kill them to, but their boys, y'know how are we gonna beat three boys?
The woman from the museum called and said that there was a cancellation and that we could move up our wedding and Chandler heard! I know! How bad is this?!
No! Why?
No no, the father can, but um, since I am the roommate I can tell you that she's not here and I'll pass along the message, ok. So bye-bye.
What? The father can't drop by to see the daughter on her birthday?
Why? It's just that I've waited seven years for an opportunity like this, and you can't even wait four and a half minutes for a stupid onion tartlet?
Why?
Sure. Oh, um, Chandler? Y'know, the-the old Monica would-would remind you to scrub that Teflon pan with a plastic brush...But I'm not gonna do that.
No, no resentment, believe me, it's worth it. 'Kay? Y'know in a relationship you have these key moments that you know you'll remember for the rest of your life? Well, every- single- second is like that with Aurora.. and I've just wasted about thirty-five of them talking to you people, so, uh.. Monica, can you help me with the door?
"Hi, uh, Richard it's Monica, um, listen I did something kind of crazy tonight, um, maybe I'm getting my period or something, I don't know." Nooo!!
Outgoing! Did that say outgoing?! Not, outgoing!!!
Yes. I hated you. I mean I, I, loved you in a 'you're my brother so I have to' kind of way, but basically, yeah, I hated your guts.
You hated me when we were kids?
Okay, the owner of Allesandro's came over to yell at me, but instead I made him some sauce, and he offered me the job as head chef!!
Hey Mon, little question for ya! How do you think this suit will look on an assistant buyer?
Whoa-whoa-whoa, Phoebe you gotta take her! Y'know I-I-I said some really bad stuff about her, but y'know Rachel has some good qualities that make her a good roommate.
Well, Phoebe that's fine because I'm not moving.
Okay, forget the specials for a minute. Umm, all right here's the thing, for the last two weeks I have umm, tried really hard to create a positive atmosphere...
Well, sure, that too.
Phoebe, it's okay. You don't have to tip toe around me. I-I've been thinking about it and umm, y'know what? I'm okay about not having that new relationship feeling...
Bye! We said good-bye at the door so as not to flaunt our new love.
Okay, guys, listen, don't forget that tomorrow is the day that Emily gets married again, so whatever we do, just try to really keep Ross's mind off of it.
Hm-mmm.
Be that as it may, d'you think you could just help us out here on that monkey thing? Y'know, just for old times' sake? Go Bobcats?
What?!
Okay ah, please don't freak out. Umm, but ah, there's a blue fingernail in one of the quiche cups, and there's no way to know which one.
Honey, don't bite your nails.
We're waiting for the adoption lady, but, hey, I'm glad you're here. I was cleaning this morning and I found this . I don't know if you wanna use it, but...
Hello, is this the creepy residence?
Okay. It's-it's about Alan. There's something that you should know. I mean, there's really no easy way to say this.. uh.. I've decided to break up with Alan.
There it is!
Chandler is supposed to find out if he's getting an assistent job at his ad agency. But out of the 15 interns, they are only hiring three.
What's going on?
So, I'll get candles and my mom's lace tablecloth, and since it's Rachel's birthday, I mean, we want it to be special, I thought I'd poach a salmon.
Excellent.
No. No, just, just, just a couple more boxes. It-it-it's no big deal, all right, I'm-I'm cool. You gotta help me out with a couple more boxes!
Monica, I'm cutting you off.
Oh, about five minutes. Right now they're interviewing his opponent. Apparently he trains by going to Iran and pulling the arms off thieves.
Hey! How long until Pete's fight?
I've got a plan. I've got a plan. I'm going to ram this platter really hard into your ribs. You're gonna scream out and that'll wake her up!
I know, what are we gonna do?
Y'know, all these years, I thought you were on my side. But maybe what you were doing was sucking up to Mom and Dad so they'd keep liking you better!
Nonono, thatthat's not what I was saying...
I can't wait to be with you! I'll sneak over as soon as Ross picks up Ben. I'll just tell Rachel I'm gonna be doing laundry for a couple of hours.
Oh, fine! Take his side!
You're the most wonderful man. And if you hadn't of said 'if I have to' like seventeen times, then I'd be saying 'okay, let's do it.'
Yeah, if I have to. Monica, I don't wanna lose you, so if I have to do it all over again, then I will.
Ok, how about this: We got wind up toys for Emma for her birthday. We can make them race, and whoever comes in last, stays!
Right.
Well, if you're gonna be totally rational about this, I can't argue with you! All right? Fine, if you wanna tell him, tell him. I just don't want to be a part of it.
Yeah well unless we tell him.
Hey, have you guys eaten, because uh, Richard and I just finished and we've got leftovers... Chicken and potatoes... What am I wearing?...Actually, nothing but rubber gloves.
What, what's about to happen? I've never seen this part before. Hey, Travis, watcha doin' with that gun? Oh no, no no Travis, put down the gun. No no no no, he he's your buddy, he's your Yeller, no, no no, the end, THE END.
You can't say that!! You-you don't know!! I mean I thought I was gonna pass out from the pain! Anyway I-I tried, but I-I couldn't...bend that way. So...
Ewwww!!
I know...God. I haven't seen my savings take a hit like this since I was a kid and they came up with double-stuffed Oreos. What happened to all our money?
Did you see our bank statement? Can this be right?
Oh, But you're finally doing something that you love! I can't ask you to give that up. Though it'd be nice if the thing that you love was y'know... finding gold.
Maybe I should quit and get a job that pays.
How do you think I am?! You've wrecked all my childhood memories. You love Ross more than me. And I just rubbed a dead mouse on my face!
How are you honey?
Ok, for my next song I think I'll sing something a little more upbeat. All right? Oh, how about the PointerSisters "I am so excited". And make it bouncy!
Comb my eyelashes.
Lewis Posin! He was my best friend in fifth grade, and-and then one day I asked him to be my boyfriend and he said no. Do you know why?
Who?
I-I'm not gonna be able to make it into work today, I don't feel very good. Yes!! Wow! Uh, for a second there I thought I was really better, but I'm not.
Really?!
Chandler... In all my life... I never thought I would be so lucky. As to...fall in love with my best...my best... There's a reason why girls don't do this!
Oh my God.
Hi, Dad. No, no, it's me. li-listen, Dad, I can't talk right now, um, but there's something, um... there's something that I've been meaning to tell you...
Monica and Rachel's apartment. Err yeh, aayah, yeh, just one second... ..ah, Rachel, it's your dad.
Wait a minute, Phoebe! We should be partners. We should be catering partners. I mean, think about it! You're not working right now, and we have such a great time together!
Yeah. Hard Ass and Wuss. We could fight crime!
Are you trying to tell me that we're moving to Oklahoma, or that you're gay? All right, not that this matters, but did they at least offer you a huge raise?
Really? Oh What A Beautiful Morning! Surrey With A Fringe On Top.
Hey, Joey, I don't think that you should leave Chandler alone. I mean it's only been two days since he broke up with Kathy. Maybe you can go fishing next week?
You don't have to stop having fun just because I'm here. Kathy didn't cheat on all of you. Well, except you.
Okay Ben, why don't you come open some more presents, and Santa, the Armadillo, and I have a little talk in the kitchen? There's a sentence, I never thought I'd say.
You bet I did, Ben, put it there! Well, it would have worked this time, if his hands weren't so damn small! Ho, ho, ho!
You invite my brother, you invite my whole family, and not me?! Why?! What-Why wouldn't you want me at your wedding? What could I have possibly done?! Stuart!
Hi Frannie, congratulations.
But I'm gonna be there... for the rest of my life. I mean, I can't break up with him. I'm the one who made him quit drinking. He's dull because of me.
Maybe it was just the kind of story where you have to be there.
OK, look. That is Aunt Iris. This woman has been playing poker since she was five. You gotta listen to every word she says. Hi!
Assistant buyer. Oh! I would be shopping... for a living!
If you would stop thinking about Ross for one minute you would notice that there are great guys everywhere! I mean, look! Look, Gunther! I mean, he's nice, he's cute.
I bet it was about her a little.
Anyway, Ross and I were always captains, and um, it got kind've competitive and one year, Geller Bowl VI, I accidentally broke Ross's nose.
No, no, no, you say that proudly.
But I need it. Otherwords I'm gonna have to take that horrible diner job. You know, with the dancing and the costumes. I don't wanna have to wear flame retardant boobs.
I, I don't have it.
I mean they're trying to do everything they can to make me quit, and if there were any other job, I would. But this is something I've been waiting for my whole life.
Ohhh!
: Oh well this is the only one they had at our video store, but they did have something called crocodile killers. Or does it always have to be sharks?
no I'm not quite sure you got the right movie that's all.
Yeah, well, I'll take a little crying any day over Howard-the-"I-win"-guy. "I win! I win!" I went out with the guy for two monthsI didn't get to win once.
Pete the Weeper? Remember that guy who used to cry every time we had sex. "Was it good for you?"
Ok, Mike, enough is enough, now you love Phoebe and she loves you, so you need to get over your whole "I never want to get married" thing and step up!
Hello?
Chandler, here you go, got your traditional Thanksgiving feast, you got your tomato soup, your grilled cheese fixin's, and your family size bag of Funyuns.
Thank you. Thank you so much!
No. No. Not it. Not it. Not it. Don't crowd me! This is it! This is the dress! Oh my God, it's perfect! I'm sorry, this one's taken! Whoa!
Hey! Rachel! Come on!!!!
No, thank you! You have given me so much! I mean, if it wasn't for you, I would never have gotten to sing Memories on the stage at the Wintergarden Theater!
Oh. Thanks.
We'll try to be more careful okay? It's just that, we don't want everyone to know because this is going really well, and maybe the reason it's going really well is because it's a secret.
Well, yeah actually.
Man, I would be great in a war! I mean, I really, I think I would make a fantastic military leader. I mean I know I would make General way before any of you guys.
I wonder how I would react under fire, y'know? And not backfire but-but heavy fire, like I was in a war or something.
Oh, you know, my flock is good, I mean, yeah, my flock pretty much takes care of themselves at this point. Good flock. Flock, flock, flock.
I was wondering you both have such serious jobs. Would you have time to take care of a baby and your flock?
All right then, then nothing changes! Everything is great! Everything stays the same! And you go unpack because it's been three days and it's driving me insane!
No!
Well, instead of being sad that tonight is my last night together with Rachel we thought we'd go out to dinner and celebrate the fact that Rachel is moving in with Phoebe.
Okay! So, what do you girls have planned for tonight?
Oh, why does this bother me so much? I mean I don't wanna be one of those people who tells their boyfriend they wanna spend 24 hours a day with them.
Ok.
Okay Ben, why don't you come open some more presents, and Santa, the Armadillo and I have a little talk in the kitchen? There's a sentence I'd never thought I'd say.
What?
Chandler, you're not fourteen anymore. Okay? Maybe it's time that you let that stuff go. If your father's not at your wedding...you're gonna regret it for the rest of your life.
Does it matter?!
Oh my God, the cat's made my eyes water! Don't-don't throw it to me! My vision's been compromised!! Oh God! Okay. Okay. It's okay. Man, that was close.
No Mon that's not the point. I'm out a thousand dollars, I'm all scratched up, and I'm stuck with this stupid cat that looks like a hand!
Ok people, we are back in business! Oh God, we've missed you soo much! Ok, go and get your hair and make-up done, and I'll take care of everything.
More than I wanna get married.
Please... honey, leave the details to me. Now I wanna make this day as special for you as I can. Now, ok, I was thinking that the harpist should wear white.
Ice sculpture? That sounds really fancy! I told you I just want a simple wedding.
Who? I mean have you seen a car come by here in the last hour and a half? I think we should call Ross, maybe he can get a car and come pick us up.
Ugh, okay, well somebody will come and save us.
I just can't believe you're in here. I mean, what am I gonna do without you? Who's gonna crash the embassy parties with me? Who's gonna take me to the Big Apple Circus?
Well, actually, you only got to sing 'Memo-'.
That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong. Y'see, he's the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born.
Yeah, calm down. You don't see Ross getting all chaotic and twirly every time they come.
Hmm, no. I mean how can I accept a restaurant from him? I-I-I-I can't. I couldn't even accept a necklace from Stu Vincent in the seventh grade.
And you're still not attracted to him at all?
Ok, so there's not a magazine under the couch, or a pack of cigarettes taped to the back of the toilet tank, or a filthy video in the VCR?
I don't, and I'm offended by the insinuation!
Oh my God. Phoebe. Don't look now, but behind us is a guy who has the potential to break our hearts and plunge us into a pit of depression.
Just wanna check my horoscope, see if it was right.
I actually know someone in advertising. I grew up with this guy who is a vice president at a big agency. Maybe I can get him to meet you? Give me the phone.
Honey? Leave it to the pros.
Okay, sperm donor number 03815, come on down! Okay, he's 6'2", 170 pounds, and he describes himself as a male Geena Davis.
No, that's all right. I just had a jar of mustard.
I know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish, but, were you planning on bringing up the whole baby/lesbian thing? Because I think it might take some of the heat off me.
Oh, we're having spaghetti! That's.... easy.
No, no, no, I don't make chocolate pies. When I was younger I-I enter in this pie-eating contest. I ate so many that just the thought of them made me sick.
You're not making the pies yourself?
Ross, Rachel promised it would be over by now. We seriously have to go, if we want to get to Vermont. I called them and the last train leaves in a half hour.
We used to be married, but then we missed a weekend away together and things kind of unraveled. Because of you! Happy Birthday.
Yeah hey, a weird thing happened today whey I was at brunch. This woman overheard that I was marrying you and-and then she...she wished me good luck.
No touch! No touch!
Any time you want. Y'know, when I was younger, all I wanted to do was to play with this dollhouse, but no!! It was to be looked at, but never played with.
Really?! Really?!
: he has to work, there's some rush on the big ah damn it one of these days I'm really gonna have to start listening when he talks about his job.
how come?
Oh good. Good, look I'm so sorry, for screwing up that cutting-her-out plan. But I have a new plan. Chandler agreed to call here in a few minutes with an emergency.
No.
Umm, I just wanna say, uh that with a pinch of exictement, a dash of hard work, a dollup of cooperation, we can have the recipe... Are you gonna kill me?
I'm so excited about having Monica come on board with us. Although I do feel bad about having fired chef Emillio, it's like losing a member of the family. Of course, that literally is the case for several of you. Tony, Carlos, Marie, please, tell your father how much we're gonna miss him. Now, I know that Monica has a lot of great ideas for this place, well, you all read the review. So without much further ado, I present to you our new head chef.
You know what? I take back what I said before. You keep playing at the restaurant, because with your music driving people inside, my bar sales are going up like crazy.
Ear plugs, or cloves of garlic?
Oh my God, it's gonna WORK! We're gonna make it work! I'm gonna be a mummy and you're gonna be a daddy! All right, I'll see you suckers. I'm gonna get me... A BABY!
Yes, but...
You say 'Thank you very much,' and then you buy me something pretty. Come on, we're gonna put are hands in this bowl, and we're gonna start squishing the tomatoes.
So when people complement me on my cooking should I, what do I say?
So, I went down to the post office, and it turns out it was those videos that I ordered for Richard about the Civil War. He loved the Civil War.
Yeah, I know, I sleep in the next room.
You know, Rachel, when you ran out of your wedding, I was there for you. I put a roof over your head, and if that means nothing to you... twenty dollars an hour.
Mon. I wish I could, but I've made plans to walk around.
Well, of course I do. What's not to like! I'll take her in a minute! But, you know, I think that you're giving up too easy, honey. I think that you need to fight for her!
Why, you don't like her?
For this weekend! Oh gosh, it would be perfect, we get to see Joey plus we get to start our anniversary celebration on the plane. We can call it out plane-aversary.
Wow!
It's great! How? Chandler. Well my boss and I worked out a deal where I only have to be in Tulsa four days a week, so the other three I can be here with you.
Okay, I have news. You don't have to move to Tulsa. You can stay here and keep your job.
So, I read this article in the paper the other day that says you're not supposed to throw rice at weddings, because when pigeons eat rice it kills them.
Aw, man I'm sorry . This must be very tough for ya, huh .
Lips moving, still talking. I mean it may not be ideal, but I'm so ready. No, I-I-I see the way Ben looks at you. It makes me ache, you know?
Oh, it's not the ideal way...
So I did tell you. Okay, y'know, that really isn't the thing. Umm, the thing is that, right now I'm just in a place in my life where I need to focus on me. Y'know what I mean?
Oh, yeah. Wasn't that like a year ago?
Tell him that you haven't seen your wife in a long time. Tell him that having a long-distance relationship is really difficult. Tell him that what little time we have is precious.
I know. You're right. I want to see you too. I've just got to figure out a way to tell Joey, you know? He's really looking forward to this.
Then you two can, can sneak into the cockpit, and things will start to heat up, and then a stewardess comes in... I've been watching too much porn.
I am a good kisser.
Look, I'm not happy about this either, but y'know if-if Ross says he's happy then we're just gonna have to keep our feelings about Emily to ourselves. Are you cool with that?
Yeah I know, we're losing Ross, Joey said hence...
Y'know what? You're right, I'm sorry. Actually you were a big help tonight. Yeah, and thanks for putting my grandmother in the cab and making sure she got to the hotel safely.
Monica! I'm not gonna screw it up!
This is Monica! I'm Phoebe's friend. Listen, Phoebe is back with David and he's going to propose to her, and she is going to say "yes" but I know she really wants to be with you!
Who is this?
Really? Weird. Anyway, see, I planned everything really well. I planned and I planned and I planned. It just turns out, I don't think I planned enough time to actually do it.
Actually, what I think you said was, "don't touch that, and get the hell out of my kitchen."
My God, I can't believe this! I mean I knew that mom and dad were invited, but I thought that was it! I mean from the ages 7 to 9 Frannie and I were inseparable!
No.
Oh no sweetie, no! This is my fault, I wasn't clear! I'm really sorry. And listen, you take as much time as you need to move out okay? There's absolutely no rush.
Oh my God! Oh, that's funny, I can't believe I did that.
What is the matter with you?!! Why aren't you more upset?! Aren't you gonna be sad that we're not gonna be living together anymore?! I mean aren't you gonna miss me at all?!
What is the matter with you?!
Maybe because you used to be aloof, or that you're really sarcastic, or that, y'know, you joke around all the time. Or that you take off your clothes and throw them on the couch.
What? What? Why?!
Are you still crying about your damn baby? Pheebs, you gotta keep the line moving, remember, 20 seconds per person. Your see these clowns all the time!
Oh, Monica made me send her to my mother's. Apparently babies and weddings don't mix.
I know that switch does something, okay? So-so I went down to city hall and got these. All I had to do was pay $25 and wait in line for three hours.
Okay, okay, okay should I be scared?
Hey! Joey said no autographs! But if she's gettting one, then I want one too: To Monica. And none of this "best wishes" crap. I want "love".
Where the hell is everybody? Bitter lady: Why don't you like me?! Chapter One: My first period.
Pants and a sweater? Why, mom? Who am I gonna meet in a blackout? Power company guys? Eligible looters? Could we talk about this later? OK.
Wow, you guys, this is big.
Great! It's so amazing! I mean, last time Dr. Roger came over, I was so nervous, but then after being with you I'm all like, "Can the doctor see me now?"
Yeah! Totally! Totally, and you?
Look, when it started I was just trying to be nice to her because she was my brother's girlfriend. And then, one thing led to another and, before I knew it, we were...shopping.
You were with Julie?
Anyway um, when he left he forgot to take the poem with him. Now, I am like totally dense about poetry, but I think it's pretty good all right. Check it out.
Well sure, you name a kid that, what do you expect them to grow up to be?
No, c'mon, we can't stop, c'mon, we've got three more pounds to go. I am the energy train and you are on board. Woo-woo, woo-woo, woo-woo Woo.
OK, stop.
Honey, you know I think you're hilarious! Come on, you know that joke you told me last week? The one about Jerry Lewis and the girl with the lazy eye...? That slayed me.
I do limericks... uhm... There once was a man named Chandler, whose wife made him die inside.
That's because I-I was just grabbing some things out of the dryer, and it's static cling. Or maybe it's just that God knew I'd be running into you and saw an opportunity.
You've got panties stuck to your leg.
So great! He showed me where the restaurant's going to be. It's this, it's this cute little place on 10th Street. Not too big, not too small. Just right.
The meeting with the guy went great?
You just told me that he hates marriage! That-that he's a-a complex fellow who's unlikely to take a wife! That-that he's against marriage and always will be!
Chandler loves marriage!!
Hi. Uh, my friend here was taking down our Christmas lights, and and she fell off the balcony and may have broken her foot or or ankle or something.
Ow ow ow. Ow ow ow ow. Ow ow ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow.
Please... Chandler is the love of my life... ... oooh leather pants! Have Mercy! Ross: So, eh... it's probably gonna be hard for you to leave Boston, huh?
Yeah, well, I guess I have forgotten about Joey and clearly you've forgotten about Chandler!
As a joke, this customer at work who has a crush on me gave me a $20,000 tip. His number is on the check, he just did so I'd call him.
What check thing?
Well umm, I was thinking that maybe we could come up with a system where we trade of being maid of honor for each other. Like hypothetically, if Phoebe were mine...
Okay, bla-bla-bla-bla!! Who is it?!
I'm a good person. And I'm a good chef, and I don't deserve to have marinara sauce all over me! Y'know what, if you want me to quit this bad, then all you have to do is...
Well that's not true.
We thought since Phoebe was staying over tonight we'd have kinda like a slumber party thing. We got some trashy magazines, we got cookie dough, we got Twister...
Okay.
Oh no, it is okay, I mean as long as you know that Chandler and I are also very hot and fiery, just as hot as you! I mean our flame, whew, is on fire!
God, I woke the beast. Sorry. I was wrong obviously, I just-I misspoke. It's okay.
Ross and Rachel don't know what they're talking about. I mean its not like their so responsible. Emma is a product of a bottle of Merlot and a five year old condom.
Oh? Did somebody miss me? Is there a child to raise poorly?
Oh, and the people are so nice. There's this one guy, Geoffrey, he's the Maitre D., Chandler, you will love him. He is without a doubt, the funniest guy I have ever met.
Awesome.
It was so wild. We told them we were the Gunnersens in room six fifteen. Only to find out the Boston Celtics had taken over the entire sixth floor!
Monana was very brave.
No, that's not it. It's just that when we were asking him all those questions before, I just... I just realized I don't care if he's the most perfect guy in the world... he's not you.
Why not, just because his great-grandmother was obese, our kids are gonna get that from you anyway!
Hi! I'm Monica and I'm gonna be singing "Delta Dawn""Delta Dawn, what's that flower you have on? Could it be a faded rose from days gone by? ..."
Just pretend they're not even here! It's OK Monica, when that spotlight hits you it so bright you won't see anyoneanyway.
And when I told her that I was gonna be moving in with Chandler, she was really supportive. You were so great. You made it so easy. And now you have to leave. And I have to live with a boy!!
Well y'know, I don't want you to be cold.
Do you wanna live outside?! Because it's gettin' cold! She gets tons of catalogs and umm, she'll fold down the pages of the things she thinks that I'd like.
Yeah and you stretch 'em out with your big old clown feet.
God, this adoption stuff is so overwhelming. There's inter-country adoption, dependency adoption.. There are so many ways to go, and this is like the biggest decision of our lives.
I do like fajitas.
Well, you're making him a frieze salad with goat cheese and pine nuts, wild nuts, wild rice, roast asparagus, and salmon au croup.
What am I making him by the way?
You guys are always hanging out in my apartment! Come on, I'll only use my left hand, huh? Come on, wussies! All right, ok, I gotta go. I'm going, and I'm gone.
Yeah, get out!
No, honey, in a wonderful way. You know what you want now. Most guys don't even have a clue. You are ready to take risks, you are ready to be vulnerable, and intimate with someone.
In a bad way?
Okay, I have looked through a bunch of career guides, photocopied and highlighted key passages and put them into alphabetical folders so you can make an informed decision.
I think she's gonna be the hit of the office, huh? She's gonna be hotter than peasant blouses and A-line skirts. Can I get a blue bow?
I know! And four ninety-nine for a pillow top queen set, who cares about the divorce, those babies will sell themselves. And I'm appalled for you by the way.
Oh, I cannot believe he's using our divorce to sell mattresses.
All right guys stop it. Rachel, we're very sorry that is a very insensitive thing for us to do. And y'know what? Let us make it up to you, we have two really great guys for you.
Yeah, y'know what I noticed Rachel? He scares easy. Is that the kind of guy you'd like to take to a ball? "Hey Sebastian, would you like to dance?" "Uhh, okay-I gotta go!"
No-no, wait! Just let me finish, okay? This isn't something that we just, we just impulsively decided in-in Vegas, this is something we both really want. And it is going to happen.
But I...
No, if he doesn't like our cookies, too bad, I am not gonna be blackmailed. Look if worse comes to worse, it gets a little warm, we'll call it a theme party.
OK, tip the man.
I think we are getting a little ahead of selves here. Okay. Okay. I am just going to get up, go to work and not think about him all day. Or else I'm just gonna get up and go to work.
Want a wedding dress? Hardly used.
Please ... if I win the lottery, you guys are not gonna leave me. Someone gave me a basket of mini-muffins last week and I couldn't get rid of you for 3 days!
Ok, well Monica, suppose one of your "special" tickets win? How are you gonna feel when you win the lottery and you lose all your friends?
Nooo! Okay. Whoa! Okay. See I was, I was a little nervous about turning thirty. So the bus boys took me out for some drinks. I wanna puke on you later!
Hey-hey are you drunk?
Oh really, so that hysterical phone call I got from a woman at sobbing 3:00 A.M., "I'll never have grandchildren, I'll never have grandchildren." was what? A wrong number?
I told mom and dad last night, they seemed to take it pretty well.
No! No-no they're not. They're still very angry! But y'know Chandler is also half-Swedish. You know what the Swedish people are famous for? Sitting down and being quiet.
Oh well, it sounds to me like your family is ready to uh, rediscover its Scottish roots.
Phoebe, you get the bear, uhm, Joey, you get the robot, and Chandler and I get the dog. Ok, and the race is going to go from here to here. Now the one who comes in last, stays!
I'm too excited!
Not until you said it. Somebody switch! Wait a minute... Ross and Charlie, Joey and Rachel, Phoebe and Mike! We're the only people leaving with the same person we came with.
You do realise that's your brother?
This would be a beautiful place to get married, yeah, but I wouldn't put the aisle there and I would never have the ceremony there! I mean you'd have the ceremony under this big beautiful arch.
I didn't know you could get married here.
Look, not that I enjoy talking about people who I went to high school with, 'cause I do, but umm, maybe we could talk about something else? Like you, I don't even know where you work?
...and then Zana, just let one rip!!
Ok, this is pumpkin pie with mockolate cookie crumb crust. This is mockolate cranberry cake, and these are mockolate chip cookies. Just like the Indians served.
She's not Rachel.
So what, you're not the only one. I mean, half the time we don't know where we're going. You've just gotta figure at some point it's all gonna come together, and it's just gonna be... un-floopy.
Yeah.
Look Ross, the only question you need to ask is, "Do you see a future?" I mean like do you see yourself marrying her? Oh my God! You did it already! You married her, didn't you?!
Okay, good stuff. Umm, well she's-she's sweet and pretty and...
Just, I love you so much. Just...It's just sometimes it bothers me that I'm never gonna have that feeling. Y'know when you meet someone for the first time and it's new and exciting? Y'know that rush?
What?
Uh, so, uh, Rach, uh... do you wanna save this wrapping paper, I mean, it's only a little bit torn... so are you gonna go for it with Ross or should I just throw it out?
I don't know, I-I guess I just had you pegged as one of those guys who're always 'me, me, me.' But you... you're a giver. You're like the most generous man I ever met. I mean... you're practically a woman.
That's Great. You know we don't need to talk about this now. Really, I mean this is, is so way, way, way, in the future, I'm talkin' hovercrafts and apes taking over the planet.
Look I want you, now.
All right. Op, here it is! Right underneath the can of-of bug bomb. I wonder if the best place to put something that cooks food is underneath the can of poison?
I want the little round waffles.
Me? What are you talking about? Nobody could steal me from you. I mean, just because I'm friends with her doesn't make me any less friends with you. I mean, you're my...We're, we're...Oh, I love you.
Yes. Monica, you don't get it. It's bad enough that she's stolen the guy who might actually be the person that I am supposed to be with, but now, she's actually , but now she's actually stealing you.
Okay, maybe this will make your teeth look less white. Nope. Okay, colors that don't work are blue, yellow, green, red, black, white, orange, and purple.
Ohhh.
You bet your ass I'm gonna fire you! Get out of my kitchen! Get out!! All right! Anybody else got a problem? How 'bout you Chuckles? You think this is funny now?
What are you gonna do? You're gonna fire me?
Well, I'll tell you what we're gonna do: We are already late for Phoebe's birthday dinner, so you point out put out that cigarette, we're gonna put this fight on hold and go have sex.
Then, I might as well ... do this . Not really sure what to do now.
Oh, he just doesn't want us to go through any trouble. Think of how excited he'll be when we go out and surprise him! Plus we get to have our own, ani-Vegas-ary! A-Nevadaversary!
Okay this is great, but Joey said he didn't want any of us out there.
Uh, Michelle. Yeah, that was me, I-I dialed your number by mistake. Oh, you're so sweet. Yeah, we were a great couple. I know I really miss him. Well, you know how it is, it's that....
I'll get it, okay. Hi, Monica and Rachel's. Yeah, just a second, can I ask who's calling. Oh, ew, it's Michelle! Ew! She, she must have that Caller Id thing. You should get that.
Okay, this is the den. All right, check this out. Lights! Whoa! All right. Less lights! Bad lights! Lights go away! Oh, see you just need to find the right command.
Whoa.
Yeah, I think we're ready for our first course. OK, um, these are rot-shrimp ravioli, and celantro pondou sauce... ... with just a touch of mints... and... ... ginger.
Let me, let me get you some wine!
Okay, Phoebe, y'know what? That-that's it, that's it, all right? No dinosaurs, no ghosts, no giant dogs, okay? They're not the right size, they're not Victorian, and they just don't go.
Okay, dinosaur attack!! Quick, everybody into the house!! Ahh-ahh! Roof! Rrroof-roof-roof!
It's okay. It's okay. Just pretend that it didn't happen! Okay? No one needs to know! I mean, Phoebe's not an official ballplayer! I mean, only official ballplayers can drop the ball!
Nah, I don't feel like playing.
I'm with you Chandler! I mean I can't have sex with a sick person either, that's disgusting! But I'm not sick! Let me prove it to you. We are two healthy people in the pribe of libe.
Don't take this personally okay? It's just that I just can't have sex with a sick person.
OK LET'S GET THESE CHAIRS OUT HERE! Gunther, hit the Christmas lights. Okay, who left the ice sculpture ON THE STEAM GRATE?
AFFIRMATIVE!
Well, because we want to get to know her better and she's never been to New York so she wants to see all the tourists' spots... you know, Statue of Liberty, Empire State Building...
So, why is Erica coming to visit?
Alright you two, I'm gonna go to the bathroom. Now I don't want anything going on while I'm gone. Here's a few things you can discuss: mucus, fungus and the idea of me and Ross doing it.
How do you think I got him in the first place?
See, this is why I told you never get involved with your assistant! And here is no such thing as keeping secrets when it comes to affairs. Did you hear that Chandler? No such thing!
Okay. See?
No! But because he thought I was to faaaaa.... And every time I think about it, it makes me feel as bad as I did in fifth grade! Y'know, I-I really think that you should apologize to Julie.
Because you kept talking to him while he was trying to go to the bathroom?!
Okay, y'know what, I'm not fine, I'm not. I mean how can I be fine, hearing you come in with her, she wants to see your bedroom.... Y'know what, what if we're friends who don't see other people?
Well, you seem fine.
I also, did a little something in fur. But umm, that's really just for me. Okay. So, why don't you go into your room and try these on and we'll see-get a better idea of what's gonna work.
Well maybe we just take that one away.
Maybe he's bothering you so much because he likes you. It's like in first grade when Skippy Langwild always pushed me on the playground because he secretly had a crush on me?
What?
I've been doing a lot of thinking. A lot! And umm, well, I came up with a whole bunch of businesses you can do with your van. Okay umm, you could be flower delivery person.
Okay, I'm hearing.
Oh my God! YOU FORGOT THE PIES? Well, I cannot believe this. You force me to make dinner, then you're an hour late and you forget the one little thing that I asked you to do.
Congratulatioooons!
I just wanted to say that I hope you do have sex tonight and I hope that you guys get back together, but I must warn you, the night that you announce your engagement I'm going to announce that I'm pregnant!
Yeah, you like that baby? May we help you?
You're supposed to double the tax. Not double the tax of Romania. I mean, what's-what's the deal? Are you, are you trying to buy me? Is this the way you get girls to go out with you?
Well, y'know, I never know how much to tip.
Oh, this terrible! Everything is destroyed! Look at this. It obviously meant enough for me to save it, and I don't even know what it is! Ohh, it's still soft. What do you think this is?
Yeah.
Level 1 alert. I repeat, level 1. This is not a drill. Okay we've got a situation. The minister just called. He's snowed in. He can't make it.
Well, I guess I'm in the wedding then. Ha haaa... He stinks!
All right, Rachel, I know-I know you think I'm crazy, please, before you tell him you love him, just-just try to find one person who thinks this is a good idea. Because I bet you, you can't.
I'm gonna do it.
Windows are clean, candels are lit. Uh, belt's to tight, gotta change the belt. Did I turn the fish? No, cause I made lasagne. Am I out of control?
Ooh.
Hey, wait a second. I can help you with this. You just need to be organized. We can make a list of your qualifications, and categorize jobs by industry. There could be folders and files!
But it's all so overwhelming. I don't know where to start.
Really? I'm really tired of being your relationship tutor. You're gonna have to figure this one for yourself. All right? Y'know what? If you're too afraid to be in a real relationship, then don't be in one.
Well, that's what we do. Y'know, I-I mess up and then you tell me how to fix it and then I do and then y'know you think I'm all cute again.
We have to do this. We are playing for women everywhere. Okay, just think about every lousy date that you ever had, okay, every guy who kept on the TV while you're making out...
Are we playing football or what? Come on you hairy-backed Marries.
Ok, trying to turn me on by making a mess? Know your audience! Besides, tomorrow we're doing those fertility tests and until then you need to keep your tadpoles in the tank.
Oh, well... Maybe we could...
Hey, umm, so listen umm, my friends were telling me a little about this ah, ultimate fighting thing and it, well it sounds really dangerous. I-I don't want you to get hurt, 'cause I kinda like you.
All right, on the table.
Hey Phoebe. Hey, tell me what you think. All right. The house next door to the one that we're buying in Westchester? Just went on the market. I wanna take a look at it, but Chandler doesn't.
I didn't say we were brothers.
And, and, and they wear those little water wings, you know. And they're, they're running around on the deck. Then Hoyt wraps this big towel around all three of them.
Yeah!
Chandler look, I don't want to be one of those wives who says, "You can't go to the game. You have to spend time with me." So, if you could just realize it on your own . . .
But hey, it's courtside. The cheerleaders are going to be right in fr. . . That's not the way to convince you.
Alright, you see these little flower blossoms? They should be facing up, not down, because, well, the head of the bed is where the sun would be. You don't love me any more do you.
Oh, alright.
Hi! If you're calling before Saturday, you've reached Monica and Chandler. But if you're calling after Saturday, you've reached Mr. and Mrs. Bing! Please leave a message for the Bings!
Okay. I'll be right there.
You don't know everything. Did you know that I'm going out with Rachel tonight instead of you? Hmm? And did you know that the only baby around here is you?! And did you know that I can't even look at you right now?!
Nah-uh! I know you! Okay? I know the thoughts that you have in the head--in your head!
Well,fall out of it. You know, you shouldn't even be here, it's a school night. Oh god, oh god. I'm like those women that you see with shiny guys named Chad. I'm Joan Collins.
Sorry.
Oh, stop beating yourself up! People make mistakes! These things happen! There aren't any message you've forgotten to give me are there? Apparently you're not very good at it! I...
I can't believe I did this! What an idiot!
It's not just the drum noise. Every five minutes, Joey throws his sticks in the air, and I have to hear, "Oh my eye! Oh god, my eye!" I mean, it is so annoying.
If you wanna give Joey a Christmas present that disrupts the entire building, why not get him something a little bit more subtle, like a wrecking ball, or a vile of small pox to release in the hallway?
I don't know! I don't-maybe you're feeling a little resentful. Maybe ah, maybe you thought you'd get married first! Maybe you can't stand the fact that your formally fat friend is getting married before you!
Monica, why? Why would I ever want to take away from your night?
Oh please! Dad turned my room into a gym 20 minutes after I moved out! I gotta say, a tanning bed and a stack of Victoria's Secret catalogues, not a gym!
They kept your room for a while.
Oh my God, me too! Oh! Oh, we'd be like friends-in-law! Y'know what the best part is? The best part is that you already know everything about him! I mean, it's like starting on the fifteenth date!
I don't know, I mean, this is just my initial gut feeling... but I'm thinking... oh, I'm thinking it'd be really great.
Well, Rachel wants to take swing dance lessons. Which I think is a really stupid idea! It's dangerous, she's never gonna get what she wants, and who knows who she might end up hurting.
What thing?
Excuse us! Alright here's a question: Who was so worried about her restaurant being fancy that she made a big deal about her friend playing her music and feels really bad about it now?
Ok, well, alright, who thinks the food is fine, the music was fine, but your evening was ruined by this incessant poll taking? .
Ok. Oh boy. You are doin' so good. You wanna squeeze my hand? All right, Ross, don't squeeze it so hard. Honey, really, don't squeeze it so hard! Oh, Ross! Let go of my hand!
Ok.
And when I told her that I was gonna be moving in with Chandler, she was really supportive. You were so great. You made it so easy. And now you have to leave. And I have to live with a boy!! TIME LAPSE.
Well y'know, I don't want you to be cold.
Aunt Syl, stop yelling! All I'm saying is that if you had told me vegetarian lasagna, I would have made vegetarian lasagna. Well, the meat's only every third layer, maybe you could scrape.
No-no-no-no, we're done.
Well, we just happen to go to alot of places where you might drink. I mean, how do you go to a wine tasting without having a drink? Or... or to a club, or to the... zoo.
Monica, have you ever been with him when he wasn't drinking?
And y'know what, I just realised, in the last year I've only gone out with two guys, Richard and Julio. You gotta help me out here, you gotta set me up, you gotta get me back in the game.
You are falling fast asleep. Deeper. Deeper. Deeper. You are now completely asleep. You don't need to smoke. Cigarettes don't control you. You are a strong, confident woman, who does not need to smoke. A strong, confident woman.
I can't believe I did this. I can't believe I'm singing for the people, and they liked me! Hey, did you hear thatone shouting "look at those tips"! I mean, did I really help you get a lot of tips?
Every little bit of you!
So, how'd the lasagne go over? Really?! Good. So you owe me three pretty things. Yeah, I've been thinking a lot about you too. I know. It's hard this whole platonic thing. It's a word!
Sure.
Yes. Well I got his machine and I left a message. But it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, because you know it was like a casual, breezy message. It was breezy! Oh God, what if it wasn't breezy?
Nooo.
OK, wait, wait, wait, wait. You know what? Ross, let's - let's switch places. You get in the middle. No un-, ya know, unless this looks like we're trying to cover something up.
Alright, shall we?
That is exactly why I do not lend you stuff!! Okay?! I mean, first it's my jewelry! And if it's not my jewelry, it's-it's my blue sweater! And if it's not my sweater, it's my sunglasses!
Okay, wait a minute. Wait a minute, I-I-I, I can't do this. Listen honey, this is, it's not Phoebe's fault. She lent me the earrings, and I lost it. I'm so sorry. Honey, I feel terrible too.
Aunt Syl, I did this as a favor, I am not a caterer. What do you want me to do with a dozen lasagnas? Nice talk, Aunt Syl. You kiss Uncle Freddie with that mouth?
Sorry.
All right. The super couldn't figure out what it did. A $200 an hour electrician couldn't figure out what it did. I've had seven pretty serious shocks. I officially give up.
Well, I then guess I'm going to Yemen! I'm going to Yemen! When we get to Yemen, can I stay with you?
What? Wait! Why? Chandler! Chandler! Wait! I'm sorry, I was just playing for one second! I was trying to find you to tell you that, look if you don't want me to see Richard again, I won't! He means nothing to me!
What does it look like? I'm going home.
It took me 28 years to find one man that I wanna spend my life with, if I have to wait another 28 years then, I'll be 56 before I can have a baby, and that's just stupid.
Well, aren't you forgetin' something? What, what, what is uh, what is that guy's name? Dad!
Well, I've tried everything. I give up. I guess I'm not gonna be the mom who makes the world's best chocolate cookies. I do make the best duck confit with broccoli rabe. Kids love that right.
Oh yeah-No, she was really nice to me, but she's in hell for sure.
Hi. About last night... I know you are under a lot of stress and even though the things you said hurt me a little bit... My point is, uh, well, I'm willing to take my job back.
Oh, man! I wouldn't have had breakfast if I knew there was going to be corsages!
I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! Hi, Tim.
Credit.
What?! Ross y'know this isn't even about you! I mean this is about Rachel and something wonderful happening for her. I mean you know even if you're right, what if he wants to sleep with her, does it mean he gets too?
Am I! Am I! Am I out of my mind! Am I losing my senses!! This dreamy guy is taking my girlfriend out for a meal.
Oh my God, oh my God, that letter is gonna go in our file! We're never gonna get a kid. No, we're gonna be one of those old couples that collects orchids or has a lot of birds!
Yeah, and don't worry. I didn't try to sound smart at all! See ya later!
Oh honey, we're close now but you-you wouldn't believe the years of-of nugies, and wedgies, and flying wedgies, and atomic wedgies, and.... That's where the waistband actually goes over your head.
So far, it kinda blows. I don't know, I just thought y'know that he'd feel more like a brother y'know, like you and Ross, just like close and connected and....
I can't believe this, just like 2 weeks ago I was watching Sudden Death, now I'm on a date with Jean-Claude Van Damme. Can you beat up that guy? Can you beat up that guy?
Alright, I hope you realize you're not getting these underpants back.
Oh, is that so? Ok. If that's really what you want, then here... I give you the headset. Well, I don't really want to give you the headset. Well I guess if you're taking over, you should probably return these messages.
Oh, well that's ok. I think you and I will do much better if you're just... here as a bridesmaid.
Hello? No, he's not here. Yeah, this is his wife. Yeah, well, it came as quite a shock to me too. I guess I should have known. Yeah, I mean, he just kept making me watch Moulin Rouge.
Would you get that please? People have been calling to congratulate me all day.
"Hi, it's Monica. I'm just checking in 'cause I got this message from you and I didn't know if it was old or new or what. So, I'm just checkin'. So let me know, or don't, whatever. I'm breezy."
Wow, what a cool job. 'You have two new messages.' 'Please, pass the pie.'
Fortunately, it is me. And, they made me head of purchasing, thank you very much. Anyway, I just ran into Ross and Chandler downstairs, and they think we should go out and celebrate. You know, someplace nice.
If it's not you, this is a horrible story.
Yeah. The great thing about the jam plan was, I was taking control of my life. So I asked myself, what is the most important thing to me in the world and that's when I came up with the baby plan.
Are you serious?
All right that's it, I give up! Whatever you want you can have it! You wanna sing a song? You wanna do a dance? You want your mom stand at the Alter and scream racial slurs? I don't care!
Hey! Uh, Monica? Chandler? Can I talk to you guys for a second?
You don't tell me what to do! I tell you what to do! Just call her. She's at the Paradise Hotel in Barbados. And while I've got you, you've got curly hair. What do you do in humidity? Damnit!
Look, if Phoebe wants to marry David, she should, I'm not gonna stand in the way of that and neither should you.
Come here! Come here! Sweetie you don't have to worry. No, besides y'know what? I'm gonna have a lot of new things with you. The first time we buy a house. Our first kid. Our first grandkid...
Well yeah! But now that I know that you're having these thoughts, I'm back to panic, anxiety, and uh I'm definitely gonna need some kind of sports drink.
I mean, why should I let them meet him? I mean, I bring a guy home, and within five minutes they're all over him. I mean, they're like- coyotes, picking off the weak members of the herd.
Nope. Schhorry.
You heard him! "No bigger!" "You're perfect!" "Just don't get any bigger!" Oh my god he sounded just like my high school wrestling coach. You know what? I'm going to have to talk to Chandler.
No you really think that's what it is?
No, I can't afford this either. No. I-I-I'm, I'm just to figure out which one I want then I'm gonna get it at Kleinman's, this discount place in Brooklyn, day after tomorrow they are having a huge sale.
Oh no, these dresses are all so amazing but there is no way I could afford one.
You went to one where you were popular, and you got to ride off Chip's motorcycle, and wear his letterman jacket. I went to one where I wore a band uniform they had to have specially made.
Okay, that doesn't help me, because we went to the same high school.
It was soo amazing, he is so sexy, and smart, which makes him even sexier. Oh gosh, I gotta so you this. Last night, we were fooling around and he stops to write a poem.
Oh, how was last night with Julio, senorita?
You know what, maybe I don't need to have children. You know maybe I just think I do because that is what society, and by that I mean my mom, has always convinced me that I... I do, I have to have children, I'm sorry, I just do.
Okay, last chance. Again, I'm sorry.
So Rach! You're the first guest at Hotel Monica! Umm, you'll just have to tell me how you like your eggs in the morning. And I thought I would bring them to you, y'know, in bed. Oh, you have been through so much.
Okay!
I don't believe this! Wow, look at this refrigerator! It's gigantic! I mean I could live in this thing! I'd be cold, but I'm always cold. Oh my God, look at these spider burners! I love spider burners.
Ohhh-hoo, funny story!
Okay, I umm, I ran into Richard yesterday and he asked me if I wanted to go for a bite and I did. The only reason I didn't tell you is because I knew you'd get mad and I didn't want to spoil our anniversary.
Simmons! Go with Simmons!
Please, don't listen to Joey, okay. Would you look at him? He-he's obviously depressed. He's away from his family; he's spending Thanksgiving with strangers. What he needs right now is for you to be his friend.
Have I been living with him for too long, or did that all just make sense?
Listen you guys, I don't mean to be a pain about this but, um, I've noticed that some of you are just placing them on. You wanna push the caps until you hear them click. Gunther, where're you going?
I'm sorry. See that's the good thing about my job. All the dinosaurs on my table are already dead.
I'm the hostess! Not those guys! I'm always the hostess! I mean, I was always the hostess, I mean even when I was little, I mean the girls brought their dollies to my tea party, I-I served the best air.
Why? Honey, what is the big deal?
All right, that I'll retract. But I stand by my review, I know food and that wasn't it. You're marinara sauce tasted like tomato juice! You should serve it with vodka and a piece of celery.
Well, you said that we except the Discover Card, which we do not!
I just ran into Dave and he told me that you blew him off! I mean, you listen to me! Now, I'm calling the shots! I say you leave Ross alone and go get Dave! What the hell were you trying to do?
Ohh! You did not drop any socks!
Okay. Could the waiters gather around to hear tonight's specials? Okay, first there is a Chilean Sea Bass prepared with a Mango relish on a bag-Why is nobody writing these down?
Yeah, people get pretty generous around the holidays. And it never hurts to wear tight trousers.
Okay, we're gonna start in the kitchen. Plates get put into plate protectors and stacked ten to a box. The silverware gets bundled in rubber bands and then bubble wrapped. Got it?
You couldn't be cool.
This is so typical. Y'know, we give, and we give, and we give. And then- we just get nothing back! And then one day, y'know, it's just, you wake up, and "See you around!" Let's go, Phoebe.
I don't think you mean that.
No! No, no... wait! We didn't lose. The rules clearly stated that the last one to cross the finish line was the loser. Well, our dog never crossed the finish line, so technically...
Yeah, see you later!
Right. Umm, listen since we're-we-re on that subject, umm, I just wanted to tell you that uh, well, I-I was going through a really hard time in London, what with my brother getting married and that guy thinking I was Ross's mother...
Yes! Good thing we have that, 'Not in New York' rule.
This isn't easy for me either. I wish things were different, I... If you were a few years older, or if I was a few years younger, or if we lived in biblical times, I would really...
Icky? You're actually gonna throw this away because it's icky?
Oh my God, it was the best funeral ever! I mean, everyone loved the food, and guess what? I even got another funeral for tomorrow-the dead-guy-from-today's best friend. I mean, it is like I am the official caterer for that accident!
Hey, how'd it go?
'Dear Dr. Remore, know that I love you and would do anything to have you.' Gosh. 'Your not-so-secretive admirer, Erica Ford.' Ooh wait, 'PS enclosed please find 14 of my eyelashes.'
Alright!
Let's see. Congress is debating a new deficit reduction bill... the mayor wants to raise subway fares again... the high today was forty-five... and- oh, teams played sports.
...And then he burst into flames.
Ugh, she's upstairs not doing the dishes! And I tell ya something! I'm not doing them this time! I don't care if those dishes sit in the sink until they're all covered with-I'll do them when I get home!
Oh. Thanks. Uh, has anyone seen Rach?
Yeah, yeah, it's interesting.. but y'know what? Just for fun, let's see what it looked like in the old spot. Alright, just to compare. Let's see. Well, it looks good there too. Let's just leave it there for a while.
I dunno.. I-I thought it looked better there. And I- and also, it's an extra seat around the coffee table.
No, you're right. Mnya, we shouldn't do it like this. Huch. For what it's worth, I'm, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have come down on you so hard about the smoking. So you had a few cigarettes, not the end of the world.
That was a celebration of life. Alright, look, I'm not gonna do this. Alright, is this really the way you want a baby to be conceived?
Honey, umm I-I love you, but umm, if you call our wedding a party one more time, you may not get invited. Okay? Listen, we could always earn more money, okay? But uh, we're only gonna get married once.
No, I realize that honey, but I'm not gonna spend all of the money on one party.
No, it is me! Y'know, I'm not just the person who needs to fluff the pillows and pay the bills as soon as they come in! Y'know, when I'm with her, I am so much more than that. I'm- I'm Monana!
Okay Monica, what are you doing? You're gonna lose your job! This is not you!
Yeah! I mean it was really funny, I-I just don't think you got it. You see Kara's coffee is-is-is weak tasting, okay? But-but what Doug was-was imply that it was weak physically. You get it now honey?
Really?
Hi, who's this? Hi, Joanne. Is Rachel working? It's Monica. Yes, I know I did a horrible thing. Joanne, it's not as simple as all that, ok? No, I don't care what Steve thinks. Hi, Steve.
Ok, Monica. I just have to know one thing. Did you go with her to Bloomingdale's? Oh! Ok, ok, ok, I just really, uh, I just really need to not be with you right now.
All right. Umm, you could uh start out with a little 1, a 2, a 1-2-3, 3, 5, a 4, a 3-2, 2, a 2-4-6, 2-4-6, 4, 2, 2, 4-7, 5-7, 6-7, 7 ...7.....7...7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7...!
Well, y'know, sometimes that helps.
All right. Umm, you could uh start out with a little 1, a 2, a 1-2-3, 3, 5, a 4, a 3-2, 2, a 2-4-6, 2-4-6, 4, 2, 2, 4-7, 5-7, 6-7, 7, ...7.....7...7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7...!
Oo, toes!! Well, for some people.
Okay, fine but please don't be upset! Okay? I was really depressed okay? And really drunk! I just wanted something stupid and meaningless. I just wanted...just sex. So, when I...went to your room that night...I was actually looking...for Joey.
Who did you originally want to hook up with?
Fine! Judge all you want to but, married a lesbian, left a man at the altar, fell in love with a gay ice dancer, threw a girl's wooden leg in a fire, livin' in a box!!
Hey, y'know, Mon, if things wrong out between you and Richard's son, you'd be able to tell your kids, that you slept with their grandfather.
Of course not. I mean gosh, Chandler what you did, it's, it's a wonderful thing and I really appreciate it. I know I have this weird thing where I want everything to be in the perfect place, but I'd never expect you to worry about that.
Do you want me to be afraid of you?
I'm going into business people. I'm sick and tired of being depressed about Richard. I needed a plan, a plan to get over my man. What's the opposite of man? Jam. Oh Joey don't! It's way to hot.
Because the kids need new shoes.
All right, I'll take one box of the mint treasures, just one, and that's it. I-I started gaining weight after I joined the Brown Birds. Remember, how Dad bought all my boxes and I ate them all?
Mon?
It's not like, I haven't any opportunities. I mean, y'know, I'm just waiting for the perfect guy. I'm seeing this guy Roger, all right? He's not perfect, but umm, I think maybe I should just get it over with. Y'know, give him my flower.
Yeah, I heard it.
You know what? This is not over. We will play you again, and we will win, and you will lose, and you will beg, and we will laugh, and we will take every last dime you have, and you will hate yourselves forever.
Mmm-hmmm. Oh, so typical. Ooo, I'm a man. Ooo, I have a penis. Ooo, I have to win money to exert my power over women.
No! No, she doesn't. Uh Phoebe, what she makes-that's uh-they're sock rabbits. They are completely different-Okay! Okay! Okay! I didn't make it! I'm sorry! I totally forgot about tonight and the fact that we're supposed to make the presents!
I see. Y'know umm, Phoebe makes sock bunnies.
Um, okay. You just called a little while ago about needing a signature on the admissions form. Well, it turns out we need a whole new one because uh, you see, I-I, I put the wrong name again. 'cause um...
Mmm hmmm.
My stock, MEG, it went up 2 points. Hey guys, do you realize that if I had invested my $127 in myself yesterday that I'd like have...a lot more than that today. Ya know what, I'm gonna do it.
What?
Yeah, well you call her and tell her that y'know when we were kids her precious little Frannie tried to undress me several times, okay? And if I hadn't have stopped her, there probably wouldn't even be a wedding to go too.
Well l-look okay, it's probably just a mistake. Let me call Aunt Sheryl okay? Maybe you are invited and the invitation just got lost in the mail.
Ya know what, I think I'm gonna go to my room and read Cosmo, maybe there's something helpful in there. Know what, at least maybe I can learn how to do an at home bikini wax with leftover Cristmas candles.
Yeah well, Ross just made plans for the whole century.
We have too! I mean what if Ross's hears that and then calls her back and then they get back together? Is that what you want? Ross back with that controlling, neurotic, crazy Emily? The Emily that wouldn't let him see you?
What?! We can't do that!
Well, if you hadn't meddled to start with, I wouldn't have had to go in there and meddle myself. Now, no matter how much we meddle, we will never be able to un-meddle the thing that you meddled up - in the first place!
Oooooooh! Meddler! Meddler!
So anyway, I'm cooking dinner for him Monday night. You know, kind of like an audition. And Phoebe, he really wants you to be here, which will be great for me because then you can 'ooh' and 'ahh' and make yummy noises.
Was it formerly owned by a blonde woman and some bears?
No, they gave us glasses with lipstick on them! I mean, if they didn't change the glasses, who knows what else they didn't change. Come on sweetie, I just want this weekend to be perfect, I mean we can change rooms, can't we?
Oh dear God, they gave us glasses!
She's this girl who used to live in the building before you did. Then she moved to England and she picked up this fake British accent. On the machine this is her message. "Monica, darling! It's Amanda calling!"
Who's Amanda?
Ok people, I want you to take a piece of paper, here you go, and write down your most embarassing memory. Oh, and I do ask that when you're not using the markers, you put the caps back on them because they will dry out.
Uhh, let's just stay clear of 'I'm the guy that's doing you daughter' and you should be ok.
Yeah, you were, but you decided to make salmon because you had some left over at the restaurant. And then you realised if you bitched about it, then you would stop cooking, and you would have to make your famous baked potato and Diet Coke.
I thought I was making him filet mignon?
I can't believe that this whole time we thought he hated us. I mean, isn't it amazing how much you can touch someone's life, without even knowing it?...Would you look at this dump? He hated us. This is his final revenge!
All right, there was none. Let's talk signing. You be noisy girl number one, you be noisy girl number two.
Yeah-yeah, y'know what? Yeah, that's it-that's it, everything will be mine! Nothing will be yours! That's-that's what I said! Oh come on, Chandler! I'm talking about the barca lounger! It just, it doesn't match! Where is it gonna go?!
Okay, I get it. So, I get nothing! Nothing here is mine! Everything here is yours! I'll get up in the morning put on your clothes, and head off to work!
Don't stare. Now she just finished throwing his clothes off the balcony, now there's just a lot of gesturing and arm-waving, , Ok, that is either, "How could you?" or, "Enormous breasts!" Here he comes!
How's it going?
See, I've been waiting my whole life to be engaged, and unlike some people I'm only planning on doing this once. So, uh y'know, maybe this is selfish and I'm sorry about it, but I was kinda hoping tonight could just be about that.
What?
Besides tampons and salt? Ooh! My God! Maple candy! That's so sweet of you. That's weird...it's empty! Ross: Hi you guys! what's going on, you... you guys wanna hang out...or...? do you...do you guys hear a buzzing?
I got you something from Vermont!
Okay, all right, how's this? 27. Italian-American guy. He's an actor, born in Queens. Wow, big family, seven sisters, and he's the only....boy. Oh my God, under personal comments 'New York Knicks, rule!'
Check it out!! Jam crackers!
Guys, hurry up! The flight leaves in four hours! It could take time to get a taxi! There could be traffic! The plane could leave early! When we get to London, there could be a line at customs! Come on!!
Total wuss!
Joey, I think you should consider something a little less risky. I mean, I think in this market, real estate is your best investment.The Fed. just lowered the rates and the interest on your mortgage is totally deductible. That's right, I know some stuff!
Yeah! Right! People eat birds... Bird meat... Now do they just fly into your mouth or you go to... you go to a restaurant and you say: "Excuse me, I'll have a bucket of fried bird." Or... or maybe just a wing or...
'Cause I was going by it the other day and I saw that there was a stock with my initials, MEG, on it and, well, sometimes I have to watch for two or three hours before it comes up again but when it does, it's pretty exciting.
Hey Monica, why are we watchin' the business channel?
A positive atmosphere! But I-I-I have had it up to here. From now on, it is gonna be my way, or the highway! All right? Does anybody have a problem with that?!! Hey new guy! I said, does anybody have a problem with that?!
Can't hear you!
Yeah, y'know, but something like salmon which would be so much more elegant than the chicken. And, you wouldn't have to worry about the salmonella. But of course with salmon you'd have to worry about the chickenella... So, I can't wait to see this place you're getting married!
Um-hmm! Doesn't that sound delicious at the last minute?
Oh, isn't he? Oh, you know, I really think this time it may work with him. I mean, he just makes me feel so good and I've been feeling so lousy this last couple of months, no job, no boyfriend. Well, at least my cup is half full.
Fun Bobby is so great.
No! Listen, I'm not gonna go through this with you again, okay. Just once I wanna beat when you can't blame it on the broken nose, the buzzer, or the fact that you thought you were getting mono. Let's just call this, tie score and it's halftime.
Woo-yay!!
Okay! Wait-wait-wait! Shhh! Okay, umm, I just wanna say that...I love you guys so-so much and-and thank you for being here on my special night. Our special night. I mean it just wouldn't be my-our-our night, if you all weren't here to celebrate with me-us-Damnit!
Okay, you get her in here. You bolt the door. I'll be in the closet.
They've only been going out for a few weeks and Phoebe is completely hung up on Mike! She'll say "No", David's heart will be broken, it will be too hard for them to recover from and then Phoebe will end up alone again.
I did! A penis one! Look, just so I know, what was so wrong about what I said?
Oh God, stop with the plan! So what, so what you saw him with a girl? Who cares?! That doesn't mean anything! Now look, you're going to go out on a date with Danny and you're going to be so charming he's gonna forget all about that stupid subway girl.
No, but I was doing my thing and everything was going according to the plan!
Why not?! I mean this has been the most amazing week. Would it be so terrible? Even if we were friends who lived together. Or, maybe someday friends who stood up in front of their other friends, and vowed to be friends forever.
You mean like exclusive friends?
Back then, I thought that I would never, ever get the chance to go out with a Chip Matthews, and now he's-he's called me up and asked me out. And the fat girl inside of me really wants to go. I-I owe her this. I never let her eat.
Oh my God, they told us that was for the mascot!
Y'know, let's face it, I'm not a kid anymore! I-I need to be with someone who-who wants the same things that I do! I mean coming to my place of work and telling me that you love me, I want that! Talking about pig sex over lunch, I don't want that!
Yeah! You're saying, you need to be with someone more mature. Maybe someone with, a license to practice medicine. Or a mustache.
This place is really my Grandmother's. I got it from her when she moved to Florida, otherwise I could never afford a place like this. So if the landlord ever asks, I'm 87 year old woman, who's afraid of her VCR. So are you thirsty?
Gotcha.
Okay, all right don't judge me to much. Okay? Um, but I saw this info-mercial, and um, I swear to you I have never-ever bought anything on TV before, except for this mop. But there was this stuff on leg waxing, it just, it looked so amazing....
Now what is Fabutec?
Oh how nice. Maybe later we can all go blow our noses on my wedding dress. Ross comes out of the guest bedroom with the diaper bag and the car seat carrying thingy.. yeah.. thats the techinal term.. He goes to Chandler.
Yeah we thought it would be nice to use the fancy china for dessert too.
I'm at work, ordinary day, you know, chop chop chop, sauti, sauti, sauti. All of a sudden, Leon, the manager, calls me into his office. It turns out they fired the head lunch chef, and guess who got the job.
What?
It bit. It was a 50's theme restraunt. I have to cook in a costume and dance on the counter. I mean I was a chef at Cafe des Artistes. I mean how could I take a job where I have to make something called Laverne and Curly Fries?
Hey, how'd the interview go?
You had a bathroom break at 2030. Pee on your own time, Mike! . Now, in regard to the toast, okay, you wanna keep them short, nothing kills a rehearsal dinner like long speeches. Okay. You just get in, do your thing and get out!
Do I have a minute to go to the bathroom?
Your boyfriend has been in there for over an hour. I can't believe it, it's like I'm living with him again. He's here when I go to sleep, he's here when I wake up, he's here when I want to use the shower, ughh. It's like I'm sixteen all over again .
What's goin' on?
Leon, Leon. Shhh! Guys. Wait, I don't understand. Those steaks were just a gift from the meat vendor. That was not a kick back. I'll just replace them and we can forget the whole thing. What corporate policy? No. Yeah. All right. I just got fired.
No.
That doesn't matter! We have waited so long for this. I don't care if it's two babies. I don't care if it's three babies! I don't care if the entire cast of "Eight is Enough" comes out of there! We are taking them home, because they are our children!
Monica, we are not ready to have two babies!
Oh. Well, I didn't realize that you needed it back right away. I mean, you told me to go and be a caterer. So I went. I beed. I mean, I... I used it to buy all this stuff. But look-I've got another job tomorrow, so I'll pay you back with the money I make from that.
I'll have one, please. Plus my money.
You're gonna find a place. But even if - God forbid - you didn't.. So you postpone the wedding. Is that really so bad? I mean, think about it. You could take all the time you needed to get everything that you want. You could have tulips, you could have salmon.... Mmmmm... Salmon!!
We can't find another place. Then we can't have the wedding! I've ordered chicken and salad and-and cake for 150. What should be the most wonderful day of my life is rapidly turning into just Sunday with a spectacular amount of food!
Hey. Oh good-good you're here! All right, I figured it out. I'm gonna take two tables of eight, I'm gonna add your parents, and I'm gonna turn them into three tables of six. Okay? And I called the caterer; I added two extra meals, we are good to go!
Hey.
Whoa-whoa-whoa, Phoebe you gotta take her! Y'know, I-I-I said some really bad stuff about her, but y'know Rachel has some good qualities that make her a good roommate. She gets tons of catalogs and umm, she'll fold down the pages of the things she thinks that I'd like.
Well, Phoebe that's fine because I'm not moving.
If it bothers you that much, just go out and get the shoes. No. Don't do this. This is stupid! I don't have to prove anything, I'm gonna go get them...But then everyone will know. Unless I get them, and then wake up really early and put them back! ...I need help!
She is a kook.
It is not over because she is going to call you and tell you she loves you. And the reason why she couldn't, is because her feelings were so strong, it scared her. Now you go home and wait for her call, she could be calling you from the plane! Come on now go! Go!
Okay. Good one.
I'm getting married!!!! I'm gonna be a bride!!!! No, I will not shut up because I'm engaged! Ohh, big talk! Huh, why don't you come over here and say that to me?! Huh, buddy?! Yeah, my fiancee will kick your ass! Come on, apartment 20! Apartment 20!
Oh no, let her stay out there. It's sweet.
Yeah! And if, and if we have a baby one-day, and the doctor hands it to you in the delivery room and you don't cry, so what! And-and-and, and if we take him to college and come home and see his empty room for the first time, and you got nothing, it won't matter to me.
Yeah?
Okay, but if we don't get this house, she's stil gonna show up wherever we go! I mean, at least if she's here, it eliminates the element of suprise. I mean, never again will you have to hear the three words that make your balls jump back up inside your body.
Will we love it so much with her next door? And she's gonna be louder out here too. Just the crickets and "Oh My God"!
You used to tell girls you were a Kennedy. Ooh, uh, thanks. Wow, little tight, isn't it? How d'you get a bigger table? You-you had a big table, but they made you move. Huh-huh, shut up Monica. Whoo, I suppose that Chandler will have the smoked duck.
I would never lie to get someone into bed.
Oh, gosh, this is so weird. I mean, his whole life was in this apartment, and now it's gone. You know, I think it would be nice if we just took a few moments, for Mr. Heckles. I mean, he was kind of a pain, he was, but, he was a person. You're all going to hell.
Yeah, yeah. Some people said some nice things about him. I think somebody should have it.
It's just, I think, there's never gonna be a right time to have a baby. I mean, now you're unemployed and in a little while you'll find a new job that'll keep you really busy. There's always gonna be a reason not to do this, but I think once the baby comes, forget about all those reasons.
I quit and you learn what I do?
Now, in some of these recipes, the quantities may seem just a little unusual, uh, like these coconut mockolate holiday nut bars. I've indicated four cups of coconut, and four cups of crushed nut, and only, uh, one tablespoon of mockolate.
I never know how long you're supposed to wait in this type of a situation before you can talk again, you know? Maybe a little longer.
Well, I thought this would be a great opportunity to use up all the food that I don't want to move to the new house with me! So, enjoy: smoke oyster casserole with a breakfast cereal crust, kidney beans in their own juices, and for dessert, a questionable orange.
Rock on! Phoebe : Wow, this is quite a spread! What is all this stuff?
With good news? Of course it is not good news, you just said "Doctor Connelly just called". If it was good news you would have said "Doctor Connelly just called! " But so what is it? Is there a problem, uh? Is there a problem with me or with you?
Doctor Connelly just called.
Excuse me, excuse me, hi, I'm Monica Geller..I'm the head chef here.. .. Ok, I was actually expecting a little applause there, but whatever! Ok, quick question: by a show of hands, how many of you were bothered by this woman's singing outside?
Get your garlic-peelers off me!
Okay, I've broken them down into categories. Okay, we have uh, we got holidays, birthdays, candids, y'know... And then what I've done is I've cross-referenced them by subject. Right? So if you're looking up, oh let's say birthdays and dogs, you get Photo 152. See?
Ohh, thank God! Finally!
Something went wrong with Underdog, and they couldn't get his head to inflate. So anyway, um, his head is like flopping down Broadway, right, and I'm just thinking... how inappropriate this is. Um, I've got something in my eye, uh, Joey, could we check it in the light, please?
Except it didn't. It happened to me. Oh, god, I'm gonna look like a big marshmallow peep. What am I doing? What am I doing? My father's right. I can't live on my own! I can't even do laundry!
No, a guy would be saying, "I'm never gonna get to sleep with anyone else." Oh my God! I'm never gonna get to sleep with anyone else! I've been so busy planning the wedding that I forgot about all the things that I'd be giving up! I mean, I...I'm never gonna have a first kiss again.
You sound like a guy.
All right, look, Ross. I realize that you have issues with Carol and Susan, and I feel for you, I do. But if you don't help me cook, I'm gonna take a bunch of those little hot dogs, and I'm gonna create a new appetizer called "pigs in Ross". All right, ball the melon.
No. Look, I told you I am not a part of this thing.
And-and-and if I die, from a long illness. And you're writing out my eulogy and you open a desk drawer and you find a note from me that says, "I will always be with you," and you still can't shed one tiny tear, I know you'll be crying a river inside.
Okay, well I won't uh, worry about this anymore then.
All right, that's a little sketch of the cake, umm some sample menus, umm y'know what I thought we would start out with Tuscan style finger food, and for music, here's an alphabetized list of all my CDs! I've highlighted the ones that would go really good with the food.
Oh, look at that.
She's living my life, and she's doing it better than me! Look at this, look. She buys tickets for plays that I wanna see. She, she buys clothes from stores that I'm intimidated by the sales people. She spent three hundred dollars on art supplies.
What?
Look, I know that you're in a place right now where you really need to hate Julie's guts, but she didn't do anything wrong. I mean, she was just a girl who met a guy, and now they go out. I really think that if you gave her a chance, you'd like her. Would you just give that a chance, for me?
You guys, um I know that this really doesn't have anything to do with me, but um I love you guys too. Oh, I really needed that.
I mean this has been like my dream since I got my first Easy Bake Oven and opened Easy Monica's Bakery. I mean I would kill for this job. I mean I can totally do this job, and God knows I paid my dues. But Pete's just doing this because he has a crush on me.
What a jerk! You want me to kick his ass?
Michelle, I only beeped in so I could hear my message. I mean that's allowed. Yeah-huh! I mean look, yeah, you know what I would really appreciate it if you didn't tell your Dad about. What do you mean, you're not comfortable with this? Come on we're friends!! That bitch always hated me. I'm calling her back.
You know what's weird. Donald Duck never wore pants. But whenever he's getting out of the shower, he always put a towel around his waist. I mean, what is that about?
Yeah, I mean yeah, I look great. Yeah, I feel great and yeah, my heart is not in trouble anymore! Blah, blah, blah! Y'know I still don't feel like I got him back, y'know? I just want to humiliate him. I wanna, I want him to be like naked and then I'm going to point at him and laugh!
What?!
Boy, I love carrots! Oh! Sometimes I like to put them between my fingers like this and-and hold them down here while I talk to you. Umm, and-and-and y'know if I get really hot umm, I-I like to pick up this knife and-and umm, I-I put the cold steal against umm, my body.
Okay.
Now, Mom, everything's going fine, really. Yeah, Ross is great. He's uh, he's in a whole other place. No, he's gone. No no, you don't have to fly back, really. What do you mean this might be your only chance? Would you stop? I'm only 26, I'm not even thinking about babies yet.
Help!
It's this dumb thing that Ross made up `cause he was trying to fool our parents. It's a way of giving the finger, without actually having to give it. I remember I cried the night you made it up, `cause it was the first time that I realized that I was actually cooler than my older brother.
Monica knows.
Y'know what really bothers me? Is-it's how-how different you act around them! I mean y'know the throwing the tennis games, the fake laugh, the "I'll see you around, Bing!" "Not if I see you first, Doug!" I gotta tell you, I don't like Work Chandler. Okay? The guy's a suck-up.
If we hadn't lost the game they never would've invented us to dinner tomorrow night.
Fair? Please don't even talk to me about fair! Fair would've been you wanting to marry me back then! Or fair would've been Chandler wanting to marry me now! Believe me, nothing about this is fair! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing!
I think that's fair.
All right, Chandler get the coats. Erica let's go. Phoebe and Joey, keep packing! Oh my God we're gonna have a baby. All right. We're gonna have a baby! OH MY GOD, WE'RE GONNA HAVE A BABY! Oh God, oh God, I got to sit down, I got to sit down. Ooh!
Yeah, you got to get to the hospital.
No-no, it's not okay! It's not! I mean you were just... You're so incredible! You went through all this time and effort to make this tape for me! Y'know I'm just gonna-I, I am gonna make this up to you! I will! I-I am going to cook anything you want in here , and I am going to do anything you want in there!
Oh, it's okay. I don't...
You are both idiots. The joke is not funny, and it's offensive to women, and doctors, and monkeys! You shouldn't be arguing over who gets credit, you should be arguing over who gets blamed for inflicting this horrible joke upon the world! Now let it go! The joke sucks!
All right, I've heard enough. I've made my decision.
I mean, all I'm asking for is just a little emotion! Is that too much to ask after six years?! I mean what? Are-are-are Rachel and I not as close as you guys?! I mean do we not have as much fun?! Don't I deserve a few tears?!! I mean we-we told Joey, he cried his eyes out!
And you're upset because you didn't make your best friend cry?
Ohh, wow! That's great! Oh wow! We really have to start planning! I have, I have a lot of really specific ideas! We should probably get together like four times per week. You can come over to my place; we'll get together before work! What do you say, 6:30, my place? I'm so excited!
Well, we just decided that Rachel is gonna be your maid of honor.
All right, listen up. There is usually only one dress in each size so when they open those doors, fan out. Now, this is what you're looking for! Memorize it! When you locate the dress, blow on these. All right? Three short blasts, when you hear it. Come running.
So this is Brooklyn.
Oh-ho-ho, sweetie, sweetie, you gotta stop saying that, now. It's no big deal, it's not even worth mentioning, you see we all do it all the time. See watch this, Ben, Ben, Ben. Ow, Monica bang! Everybody bang. Ben bang. Rachel bang. Bang, Rachel bang! Oh, isn't that fun?
Monica bang!
Okay, while we're waiting for these pills to kick in, I'm gonna sit you down on the couch. Come on. Get some nice soft pillows under your head, I'm gonna turn the TV on and you can watch whatever you want. And I'm-Sit down--gonna make you some tea. And then, I'm gonna rub your feet.
Oh no, I don't believe in Western medicine. No, if you just apply pressure to these points right here. Then your hand starts to hurt and you still have a headache, so thanks.
I swear, I promise. I promise. Oh my God, I'm so excited! {And I just can't hide it! I'm about to lose control and I think I like it! Sorry, just couldn't resist it.} All right, listen let me tell you, do not get her flowers. Okay? Because y'know, she cries when they die, and there's the whole funeral...
Tonight, but don't say anything. Okay?
Well, if you really think about it, I mean four days is not that long. I mean, I see you Monday before you go to work, and I see you Thursday when you get back, and I always work late on Tuesdays, so really if you think about it, it's really just one day. And well, if we can't make it one day, we've got real problems my friend.
What happened to 'you can't live without me four days a week'?
See? That's what I mean. I mean that, that's great! But I wouldn't trade in what I have for that. I mean I'm gonna be with Chandler for the rest of my life, and that's what makes me happy. Hey sweetie, come here! Come sit down. Hey Phoebe and I were just talking about how our relationship is deep and meaningful. It really is don't you think?
I miss you too!!!!
Okay, I was thinking we should have a beautiful guest room, right? With a mahogany sleigh bed and bedside tables with flowers on them all the time! And we could have a roll top desk with comment cards on them so people could say how much they loved staying here!! Okay, whatever, I really haven't thought about it that much.
Sure!
Ok, here we go. We need to sort out the tickets as quickly as possible to see if we've won. So does anybody have any ideas how to organize this? Ok, how about this: we divide them into 6 groups of 40, and the remaining 10 can be read by whoever finishes their pile first.
Ooh, you guys, it starts in like 20 minutes.
Ohhh, I knew you loved her! Then you need to go to the airport and tell her. You're probably just gonna catch her just as she's about to go to the gate. You're gonna call out her name and say, "I love you!" And she's gonna say, "I love you, too!" And you guys are going to have the most amazing kiss, everyone at the gate will applaud.
What-what is love really?
I know. Let's try a look...of far off...wonderment. Okay, we'll-we'll gaze into our future and we'll think about our marriage and the days to come. Chandler! What is the matter with your face?! I mean this picture is supposed to say "Geller and Bing to be married," not "Local woman saves drowning moron!" Hey! Don't laugh at him! He's my drowning moron!
Okay.
This switch thing has been driving me crazy. So I turned it off and checked every outlet. Now, four of them don't work. Which means, one of them has to be controlled by the switch. So, I plugged in things in all four of the outlets that-that make noise, so that way, when I turn it on I just follow the noise and find out which one it is.
Hey! What's up?
Hi, Nancy. Hi, it's Monica Geller. I'm good. Listen, I'm looking for a job in Tulsa. Well yeah, my husband has been relocated...Because I love him! No, I don't want a job in New York. Javo is looking? Oh my God! He asked for me personally? Oh my God! Oh, wow, this is really flattering, but I'm moving to Tulsa. Yeah, so if you would tell Javo 'I'll take it!'
Can I just say how much I appreciate you coming with me. When we get to Tulsa I'm taking you for a great dinner at 'Slim Pickings'. 'So Cheesy'? 'Whole Hog'? It's going to be tough to keep Kosher in Tulsa.
No, look, she's obviously unstable, okay? I mean she's thinking about running out on her wedding day. Okay, fine! But I mean, look at the position she's putting him in! What's he gonna do? Ross is gonna run over there on the wedding day and break up the marriage?! I mean, who would do that?! Okay, fine, all right, but that's y'know, it's different! Although it did involve a lot of the same people.
I don't think he's the one who needs help.
Hi, uh, Richard it's Monica, um, listen I did something kind of crazy tonight, um, maybe I'm getting my period or something, I don't know. Um, anyway, I, I, I beeped into your machine and I heard a message that, that freaked me out, and um, you know what Michelle will tell you the rest. I, I, um, I'm sorry, okay, I, I hope that we can forget the whole thing. Okay, bye.
Message erased. To record a message begin speaking at the tone.
How hard is it? No shoes on the furniture. Back to Monica and Chandler's apartment. Amy is sitting on a chair by the bay window looking mad. Joey groans and gets off the phone: The producer from Days left a message on my machine asking why I wasn't at the parade. They said everybody's pissed off at me.. And they all got to meet Santa!
You said that to me last week.
It is so weird, I know what I said, but uh, this morning, I was lying in bed I was, I was imagining what it would be like to say yes. I know it's a little sudden, and it's a little rushed, and it's totally not like me to do something like this, but that doesn't mean I can't. Right? I mean I'm-I'm crazy about Pete, and I know that we want the same things, and when I thought about saying yes, it made me really happy.
Oh, you so would! Oh, you should get that anyway. Like for clubbing.
I really like to say that I'm-um... Y'know what I'd really like to say? I'm drunk!! That's right mom and dad your little Harmonica is hammered!! And guess what! I've been drunk before! And I've smoked a cigarette! And I got a box of Ding-Dongs hidden in my underwear drawer! It's all okay. It's okay because I turned thirty today. And, and I can do anything I want! Because I am a grown up.
Wooo!! Hoo!!
It's gonna be really scary. I mean, god. When we have a baby, there's gonna be so much that we're not able to control. I mean, the apartment's gonna be a mess, I won't have time to clean it. What if the baby gets into the ribbon drawer? Messes up all the ribbons?! What if there's no room for a ribbon drawer, because the baby's stuff takes up all the space!? Where will all the ribbons go!?!
I guess. It's always gonna be scary when we have a baby.
Hello? Yeah, hi! Mrs. Tribbiani? Hi, this is Monica Geller. Yeah I'm just calling to say that Chandler and I uh, really hope you can make it to the wedding. Yeah, apparently a bunch of invitations that we sent weren't delivered. Umm, I guess there was some screw up at the damn post office! T-Tell me about it! Yeah, yeah, the US Post Office? No, more like US lost office! What are they Irish?!
I don't know. Just uh, just tell 'em it was a mix-up with the invitations, or-No-no-no! Blame it on the post office. They hate the post office. And the Irish! But I don't think you can blame it on them so...
Emily has probably been planning it since she was five! Ever since the first time she took a pillowcase and hung it off the back of her head. That's what we did! We dreamed about the perfect wedding, and the perfect place, with the perfect four-tiered wedding cake , with the little people on top. Thanks. But the most important part is that we had the perfect guy who understood just how important all that other stuff was.
I don't know. A month?
Chandler, for so long I...I wondered if I would ever find my prince, my soul mate. Then three years ago, at another wedding I turned to a friend for comfort. And in stead, I found everything that I'd ever been looking for my whole life. And now...here we are...with our future before us...and I only want to spend it with you, my prince, my soul mate, my friend. Unless you don't want to. You go!
Go on! Go on.
Absolutely! Now get out of here you!! Okay, I'm running out of places I can touch him! Look, is there something wrong with me? I mean why am I only attracted to guys where there's no future? Either they're too old, or they're too young, and then there's Pete who's-who's crazy about me, and who's absolutely perfect for me, and there's like zip going on! I mean, seriously, does it sound like something's wrong with me?!
So ah, we on for tomorrow?
Why? Because everything is my responsibility? Isn't it enough that I'm making Thanksgiving dinner for everyone? You know, everyone wants a different kind of potatoes, so I'm making different kinds of potatoes. Does anybody care what kind of potatoes I want? Nooooo, no, no! Just as long as Phoebe gets her peas and onions, and Mario gets his tots, and it's my first Thanksgiving, and it's all burned, and, and I... I...
Because!
Y'know, so I don't read as many important books as you do, and I don't write trick poems that seem to be about one thing but are actually about something else. And y'know what, I get excited about stupid stuff, like when I my People magazine comes on Saturday, and the new Hold Everything catalog. Y'know but that does not mean that I'm empty, I care about things. I care about my friends and family. You have no right to make that kind of judgment about me.
What?
Phoebe, that's how it starts. I don't need to eat the cake, I'll just smell the icing... why don't I just eat a little sliver, or, okay, just a slice or two. And next thing you know, you're 210 pounds and you get wedged in going down the tunnel slide. Phoebe, honey, I know this is hard. Look, if you talk to him, you're going to wanna see him. And if you see him, you're going to want to get back together with him. I know that's not what you want. Give me your phone.
I gotta call him. Just to talk to him, there's no harm in that.
