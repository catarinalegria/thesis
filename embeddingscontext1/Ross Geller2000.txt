She barely knows me. We just live in the same building.
Oh! ...Hello, dear.
I'm tellin' you Ross, she wants you.
Any contact?
She lent me an egg once.
Kiwi? Kiwi? I thought it was a key lime pie.
I don't know. What's in this pie?
Uh, I don't know, butter, eggs, flour, lime, kiwi--
No I didn't, I said kiwi lime. That's what makes it so special.
And that's what's gonna kill me. I'm allergic to kiwi.
Well, the doctor says he's gonna be fine, he's just sleeping now.
Yeah. The doctor got the 'K' out. He also found an 'M' and an 'O'.
We think he was trying to spell out 'MONKEY.'
So, you feel like a dad yet?
No, why?
Well, I was going to, but after I talked to you, I talked to Joey.
I just, I wanted to thank you for our uh, our little talk before.
Oh, God, no problem. So you're gonna go with the uh, waiting thing?
What did, what did he say?
Basically he told me to get over myself and just do it, ya know. So I though about what you said and I though about what he said and, well, his way I get to have sex tonight so. . .
Well I had a great time! Umm, Chancy on the other hand...
Hey.
Hey! How was it?
I will tell the story! It was going great. I let him win. We were bonding. He even said I could call him dad.
And what did he ask you not to call him?
Your mother's right. Take her, you can wear my tux.
Doubtful.
Jack, give me that. Talk to your son.
Dad, she won't want to go with me.
Of course she would, you're a college man.
You bet. In the U.S., China, Africa, all over.
Pheebs, I have studied evolution my entire adult life. Ok, I can tell you, we have collected fossils from all over the world that actually show the evolution of different species, ok? You can literally see them evolving through time.
Really? You can actually see it?
See, I didn't know that.
Well, there you go.
Ok, bye. Well, Monica's not coming, it's just gonna be me and Rachel.
What's going on here? You go out with tons of girls.
I know, but, I made a huge mistake. I never should have broken up with her. Will you help me? Please?
Oh. Well, hold on camper, are you sure you've thought this thing through?
It's laundry. The thinking through is minimal.
I got it. So hi, I'm uh, I'm Ross and this is my friend Chandler.
Uh yeah! Let me, let me get that for you.
It-it's really heavy.
I-I am Kristen.
Kristen, hi. Are you uh, new to the area, 'cause if you are...I'd love to show you around sometime.
Exactly. So you didn't, didn't mention anything to Issac right?
Just you keep it, listen did you, did you tell anyone about us?
Oh no. I feel it isn't really anybody's business, y'know.
Oh, well I tell Issac everything.
You tell, of course you do. Issac. Issac. Hey, Issac. Issac, hi! Y'know we haven't actually met...
Oh well, since I have that whole history with Rachel, I guess Phoebe.
That's a good point.
Yeah.
Okay, great!
All right.
Are you angry at me because I said your handwriting is childlike?
Okay, are you mad at me because my hair gel smells?
No.
No that made me feel precious.
Oh, I know! Umm, is it because he's always correcting people's grammar? Whom! Whom! Sometimes it's who!
Hey Chandler, there's a party tomorrow, you'll feel better then.
Yes, but you ended up having sex with both of them that afternoon.
Sorry, I just, any excuse to tell that story y'know....
Oh, y'know what, I'm gonna be okay, you don't have to throw a party for me.
It's Joey's birthday.
Yeah, if you're really hungry. It was a joke, I made a joke.
There never was a library. I mean there are libraries, its just that I ah, I never worked at one.
You know what's really good here, the lobster. What do you say shall I just order three.
Yeah, actually Daddy Ross is allergic to lobster.
What kind of person is allergic to lobster? I guess the kind of person that works at a library.
Sorry. 'Cause umm, I think this will make you a little more sophisticated.
Well I, close your eyes, I just think you're gonna like this a little better, 'cause, close-close...
Blow it.
Sophisticated like a hooker?
Hey!
Oh my-Come here! Come here! It's okay. Everything's gonna be okay.
Ohh, what's wrong?!
Monica and Chandler are really moving in here and I have to move out and everything is changing.
Thank you.
Of course.
Wait a minute, she was walking the bike? Both times?
Oh yeah! I saw her walkin' it down the street the other day. She had uh, these flowers in the basket. It was so cute.
Yeah, I saw her this morning walkin' it by the park.
Hey Pheebs?
Oh hi!
Oh, 's'funny, really? Um, I don't remember you making any sperm.
Well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title?
It's my baby too.
Yeah, and we all know what a challenge that is!
All right, you two, stop it!
Ross has the blender! Ugh, everything's just falling apart!
I hadn't! Photo 152 was a prototype.
Ohhhh. Honey, honey, honey, it's okay, it's okay honey. I'm gonna fix you a drink, huh? Maybe a margarita?
No honey, it's okay! Listen, I'll got to Ross's and get the blender, you get all the margarita stuff ready.
All right, he's keys are in the drawer. Y'know what? I also need some cash.
Well, excuse her for knowing what she wants to do with her life!
I think he can be.
Well, maybe he wouldn't be she didn't bring the office home every night!
Yeah well, she certainly knew what she was doing New Year's Eve 1997.
I knew you were gonna throw that in my face!! That was three years ago! She apologized and she apologized! What more do you want?!!
Well, we didn't have freedom here until 1776, either so...
What's ah, what's so funny about that?
Well I mean, you're American to start with. You don't even have rugby here.
So good then! We'll see you at Riverside Park at 2:00! Cheers!
Cheers!
So what's a matter, you need a dentist? I've got a good one.
No, no, it's just my tooth.
All right I'll have one.
No thanks, I have a good one too. I just, I, I can't see him.
See that is the problem with invisible dentists.
I wanna get out of the room! Y'know, I...I really miss downstairs.
Nope! Something else.
Oops! All right, so what do you want to do now?
Okay, y'know what? There's only one way I'm leaving this hotel room.
Well hello! I'm Ross!
No, no, we will. We just won't tell her she messed up.
Oh My God, she-she made half a English Trifle, and half a...Sheperd's Pie!
Oh man! Now she's gonna start all over! We're never gonna get to introduce the hot girls to the new world!
Just let her serve the beef-custard thing?
Yeah, it'll be like a funny Thanksgiving story!
No, but, but I wanna be with you in spite of all those things.
Rach, come on, look, I know how you must feel.
No, you don't, Ross. Imagine the worst things you think about yourself. Now, how would you feel if the one person that you trusted the most in the world not only thinks them too, but actually uses them as reasons not to be with you.
Oh, well, that's, that's mighty big of you, Ross. I said don't go!
You know what? You know what? If, things were the other way around, there's nothing you could put on a list that would ever make me not want to be with you.
Oh, guys, you should've seen him. 'Read 'em and weep.'
We were playing poker, alright...
There was chocolate on the three. It looked like an eight, alright?
And then he did.
Well, now, how come you guys have never played poker with us?
My dad wanted to know if you wanted to play racquetball with us.
No, why?
Then free as a bird. What's up?
Wow! That's great! Dad must really like you, he doesn't ask just anyone to play.
Yeah and he didn't really ask for you, he asked for Chancy, I assumed he meant you.
No, no, no, no, no, no, not out of that, not out of clothes.
That won't go with this dress though.
No, you're right. Well, we'll find something. Let's just get you out of that. Come on.
Monica, can Phoebe borrow your green dress?
I called him.
C'mon, you know everyone I've been with. All, both of them.
Tell me about it. So what, what's your magic number?
Uhhhooo.
Well, there's you.
Better not be doin' these in order.
Okay, I'll see you soon buddy. Be back in an hour.
I wasn't talking to you.
I'll be okay.
Bye dad.
Bye. Ahhh... So this is fun, huh?
Yeah, it's his, uh, innate Alan-ness that-that-that we adore.
..I dunno, a little too Alan?
Well, no. That's impossible. You can never be too Alan.
I personally could have a gallon of Alan.
Hey, Lizzie.
So, uh, Jules tells me you guys are going shopping tomorrow?
But I'm...
Monica, she will kill you. She will kill you like a dog in the street.
Yeah, uh, it's actually not that big a deal.
It's a big deal to me. This is great, Monica. I really appreciate this.
Apparently Phoebe's mother also goes by the name Julio.
Good for you!!
You guys, you're never gonna believe what I just found tacked up on a telephone pole! Look kinda familiar?
You guys, there's a little girl in Soho looking for this cat. I mean, you know what that means?!
Yeah-eah! 200 dollar reward, split five ways!!
You were worried about me? You didn't know how I was going to react?
What? What? What?! You guys knew? You all knew and you didn't tell me?!!
Well, Ross, we were worried about you. We didn't know how you were going to react.
Okay, all right, whew! What do you say we all clear out of here and let these two lovebirds get back down to business? Hey-hey-hey, I-I-I'm just talking here, he-he's the one doing your sister.
Hey, you know what I just realized? If you guys ever have kids...
All right, let's uh, let's bring it back down and-and try again.
Okay, I don't think it's going to pivot anymore.
You think?!
Okay, yeah, I think it's really stuck now.
I can't believe that didn't work!
Yay! And that takes what? Just six or seven minutes.
No. So, um, let's see your pretty close, huh. Make-up's on, hair's done.
Yeah, I just have to get dressed.
Yeah! Once, I figure out what I'm wearing.
Glass of fat?
Uhh, okay, it's uh, Emily and I, we decided to uh, to get married.
What-what's going on?
Ross has some big thing to tell everyone.
What? Oh, are you pregnant too?!
Umm, no.
Oh, no, no, no, it's-it's not the lecture ah, I mind, umm....
Hmmm. Oh, no, no, I just thinking about something funny I heard today. Umm, Mark, Mark saying 'I'll see you Saturday.'
Yeah, at the lecture, I told you that last week, you said you didn't mind.
Oh, please tell me it's not because I'm going with Mark.
Oh, well...
Okay Phoebe, I guess you're next although I really don't see the point.
Yeah, it really was!
Aw, thanks!
Yeah.
Okay, I can't believe that Monica and Chandler are getting married. I remember talking about this day with Rachel while we were showering together, naked.
No-no, one daddy, two mommies. All right, it's all yours.
Okay, let me just straighten out your helmet there.
Thanks daddy.
Okay. Okay.
Yes! Yes! Yes!!
There's this kid in my class who said he's in love with me.
Can I ask you something? Have you ever had a guy have a crush on you?
Is that why you wanted to tie my tie?
Whoa!
Whoa what?
Yeah. I mean, it's been kinda quiet since Carol left, so...
Hey, that monkey's got a Ross on its ass!
Ross, is he gonna live with you, like, in your apartment?
Why don't you just get a roommate?
Nah, I dunno... I think you reach a certain age, having a roommate is kinda pathe- ....sorry, that's, that's 'pathet', which is Sanskrit for 'really cool way to live'.
Coffee sounds great. Wait, so, so you live in Montreal?
Are we really in Montreal?!
Yes we are. So, coffee?
Oh, no. But it's just a two hour ferry ride to Nova Scotia.
Well I guess I should've thought about my wife and kids before I talked back to chef Geller!
I'm having a baby in here! Ok, everyone stand back. Ow.
Ok, who wants to hear something ironic?
Help!
Are they here yet?
No, honey, they're not, but don't worry, because we are going to find them, and until we do, we are all here for you, ok?
Look, we're just friends now! Okay? Why would I do anything stupid?
Look, I do not re-love her.
I can't believe you won't just admit it! Okay, just promise me that you won't do anything stupid.
Ugh!!! Well, the apartment is already subletted! I mean, this is just hopeless. I'm never gonna find anything.
You can live with me.
Yeah, I'm gonna go to a doctor who went to school in a mini-mall.
Four percent. Okay. I tip more than that when there's a bug in my food.
Ross, tonight was about the two of you getting along. Oh, would you just see my chiropractor, already.
Hey Pheebs, what are you doing?
I'm, I'm freaking out! Monica kinda trusted me with something and she shouldn't have! All right, I haven't lived here in a while, so I have to ask you something. Does Monica still turn on the lights in her bedroom?
Yeah, I'm-I'm sure. Yeah, get out of here before I change my mind.
Sure! Here.
Thank you. Now are you sure? Because once I make a copy, there's no turning back.
Umm, listen, Ross do you really think this moving in with Rachel is a good idea?
I've been back and forth.
Okay! All right! Now, Chandler you-you wanna live with Monica, right?
Why do you do it?
I don't know.
Yeah, I do.
And Mon, you wanna live with Chandler, don't ya?
Come here, come here. Uh, ow! Emily, will you marry me?
Yes!
We're getting married!
Yes.
Ohh, it's a bit small.
I-They would not let us get married when we were that drunk!
We-we-we-I remember being in a chapel.
Oh my God.
No!
They let you get married when you're drunk! Most people who get married in Vegas are drunk!
Oh well. It probably would've been the most constructive solution.
What?
Stupid balls are in the way.
You have chalk on your face.
Huh?
To be fair, he doesn't seem to be impersonating Fonzie...
It's not that weird, is it?
It's very weird! I don't want some guy down there telling me, I'm y'know, dilatedamundo!
What are you doing?!! Why are you defending him?! Just get me another doctor! One who is not crazy and who is not Fonzie!
Again, it's not that he...
Look, do you love her? And you don't have to be too emphatic about this.
I uh can't believe I'm gonna say this, but I think Susan's right.
You do?
Of course I do.
Well then that's it. And if George and Adelaide can't accept that, then the hell with them. Look, if my parents didn't want me to marry you, no way that would have stopped me. Look, this is your wedding. Do it.
And she's just so sexy and funny and has the cutest little...
Well, I-I was watching her the other day at the pizza place.
Hm-mmm.
Okay, y'know what? We don't need her measurements.
Okay pepperoni, pepperoni, pepperoni, okay Ross, I know she's pretty and you love her, but is she stupid?! She forgot my vegetarian!
Yeah. Hey, remember the time I jammed that pencil into your hand?
I just wanna thank you for being there for me today. And I'm sorry I,I almost broke your hand.
That's ok. I'm sorry I poisoned you.
Remember it? What do you think this is, a freckle?
Oh.
I said 'share' not 'scare'. Go sit over there! .
Your Mom, your telling me, your telling me, about your Mom, what is the matter with you?
You said...
We're baack!
Hey!
Okay. Umm, for a while now, I've been wanting to, um....
Hey, I have a question. Well, actually, it's not so much a question as.. more of a general wondering... ment.
Okay.
Ohhh!!!!
Yes, yes, that's right...
Hey guys, does anybody know a good date place in the neighborhood?
I don't know. I don't know. It's just going to be so great!
Ooh! I know what you could make! I know! Oh, you should definitely make that thing... you know, with the stuff? You know, that thing... with the stuff...? OK, I don't know.
How about Tony's? If you can finish a 32-ounce steak, it's free.
OK, ahem, hey, does anybody know a good place if you're not dating a puma?
Oh really? Well I-I guess Monica should know about Atlantic City.
How could you tell her?!
I had too okay?! We're getting married! Married couples can't keep secrets from one another!
Du-ude!
What happened in Atlantic City?!
All right, you know that one was coming, but that doesn't mean you have unagi.
You mean in case someone is trying to steal your bamboo sleeping mat or your kettle of fish?
All I'm saying is, it's one thing being prepared for an attack against like each other; whole another story being prepared for an attack, I don't know, like a surprise!!
Ooh! Y'know what? If we made reservations, we could have unagi in about a half-hour.
Y'know what...
No, hey, well, I-I completely understand. You were, you were stressed.
Hey.
Hi. Look um, about what happened earlier...
I was gonna give you a chance to apologise to me.
For what? For letting you throw me out of your office?
Joey, you are gonna love this guy. Gandolf is like the party wizard!
All right, were you guys smoking something in the back of our van?
Really. And what do you mean you never have fun anymore? You have fun with me, remember that time we saw those strippers and you paid me 50 bucks to eat that book?
Well, why do you call him Gandolf?
Gandolf the wizard. Hello! Didn't you read Lord of the Rings in high school?
Okay, it's second down. Take all the second downs you need.
It just amazes me that your still pulling stuff like this.
Pulling what? It's second down.
I heard that!
Well, I said it loud.
That's right, and that's why we celebrate Hanukkah today. The end.
...and the miracle was that that little bit of oil that should've just lasted just one day, burned for...
Eight whole days.
Awesome!
Yeah?
Yes, yes it is. In prison! Whatsa matter with you?
Cupping.
That's how they do pants! First they go up one side, they move it over, then they go up the other side, they move it back, and then they do the rear. What? Ross, Ross, would you tell him? Isn't that how they measure pants?
What? That's not? Oh my God.
Even Mary Tyler Moore would've been better.
All right, it's cool you can stay here. My parents won't mind.
Listen, Roland Chang, if things go well, I'm gonna be out with her all night.
Dude, don't do that too me!
No, it's not that, I just don't want to be stuck here all night with your fat sister.
Hey!
So then if-if-I mean if you think about it, this is all your fault.
Yeah?
And uh, yeah, I didn't really, I didn't want to say anything, but it kinda it just, it kinda kept coming back to me, and umm, remember we were in the casino and for some reason thought it would be funny to eat a lot of grapes. And uh, and I thought it would be funnier if we got married. So as a, as a compromise we decided first to get married, and then to eat a lot of grapes. So umm, sorry I got us into this mess.
Yeah, don't push it though.
I've got to say; I know I divorce a lot of women, never thought I would be divorcing you.
Hey, uh, I'm really, really sorry about what happened in the cafeteria today.
That's okay, I'm cool over here. I'll catch up with you later, Joey.
Op, this is saved. Gift shop.
It's no big deal. Hey, y'know, you do what you gotta do. Right?
But hey, it's not just me, I mean the scientists and the tour guides never sit together.
Oh God, this is so nerve wracking! How-how do you do this?
I'm kidding.
Oh, me too.
Well, unfortunately, I don't get many callbacks so...
Is it a good sign that they asked us to hang around after the audition?
It doesn't matter! It's my principles! We're talking about my principles!
Sounds like a fun party.
Hmm. Look, Ross, if you want your neighbors to like you, why don't you just pay the hundred bucks? The party's gonna cost you way more than that.
Okay, I thought it was about your neighbors liking you.
Oh, they'll like me. Once they come to my awesome PAR-TAY! Okay, I gotta run. I gotta go get some nametags.
Just you keep it, listen did you, did you tell anyone about us?
You took my watch?
I'm sorry, I do that.
Oh no. I feel it isn't really anybody's business, y'know.
Exactly. So you didn't, didn't mention anything to Issac right?
No. No-no uh, he just, he just really freaked me out before.
Ehh, I was just, I was just thinking about your father.
Well, whatever works for ya...
Oh. Well, so we have to hide our relationship from one more person. Big deal. Besides, it's kinda fun hiding.
Yeah.
I know. He's like a new man. It's like a scene from Cocoon.
Honey. Honey, have you seen my Harmon Kilerbrew bat? Bob doesn't believe I have one.
I have no idea. Did you know Richard has a twinkie in the city?
I just never would have pictured Richard with a bimbo.
Apparently, he told Johnny Shapiro that she's quite a girl. In fact, he told Johnny that he thinks he's falling in love with her.
There was just an explosion, okay? My hearing would be impaired.
That'll be a neat trick, when you're, when you're dead!
Ross, you don't have to yell.
I thought you were excellent! In fact for a minute there I was like, "Ooh, where'd Ross go?"
Thank you! And I have to say that first scene when you meet Mac...
What? I'm kidding. You know I'd never let him touch the Porsche.
Tell you what, maybe one of these weekends you can borrow the car and I cou. . .
Dad, I beg you not to finish that sentence.
OK Rach, which, which lily? This lily or that lily?
Well I. . .
That's a good point. So uh, how long are you gonna punish him?
Listen, Joey, I know what he did was wrong but don't you think you could at least hear the guy out?
Back when you and Rachel were together, if Chandler had kissed her, would you hear him out?
Five years.
You've sentenced him?!
That'll be a neat trick, when you're, when you're dead!
I can't! My circuits are fried! They're fried I tell you!!
Wow! Well then I'll just have to carry you.
Ross, you don't have to yell.
There was just an explosion, okay? My hearing would be impaired.
Open with a joke? It's a university, not a comedy club!
Ohh! Okay! Okay. "There are three primary theories concerning sediment flow rate. Each of these theories can be further subcategorized into..."
Why don't you open with a joke?
Wait a minute, hold the phone! You're not talking about Chuckles University?!
Okay!
Well, what-what would you do? Rach, if you were me, what-what would you do?
No, no, it's okay. Really. They're plenty of people who just see their sisters at Thanksgiving and just see their college roommates at reunions and just see Joey at Burger King. So is, is that better?
No, it's not better. I still don't get to see you.
Well, for starters I would've said the right name at my wedding!
I can't believe this is happening.
I don't, I don't understand. I mean, you, it's like we can't win with you guys.
Ross, you have to understand that your nice thing makes us feel this big.
Actually, it makes us feel that big.
If you guys feel this big, maybe that's not our fault. Maybe that's just how you feel.
Oh, now you're tellin' us how you feel.
Why don't we just put 'poor little Tooty' out in the hall?
Sorry, that was wax.
Oh, poor little Tooty is scared to death. We should find his owner.
During a blackout? He'd get trampled!
Yeah?
Hey, if mommy can have a wife, daddy can have a bra.
You think about it.
I left a bra drying on the shower rod, you don't think your son will think it's yours and be horribly traumatised?
Ohh, it's time to go.
Oh, no-no-no, see, that-that clock's a little fast, uh, we have 17 minutes. Huh, what can we do in 17 minutes? Twice?
Hey look, Phoebe. I, uh, I laid out the states geographically...
Hey! What's she doing back here?
Relax, Ross. She's not made of ice cream!
No, no, we don't really have time for this right now. Okay, we have to keep Chandler away from my bedroom.
Yeah, but, but look what I'm...
Oh my God. But the zoo told me that my monkey was dead.
Buddy, my monkey?
Oh, yeah, right. There was a break-in, few months back, inside job. Your monkey was taken.
The zoo! Do you believe everything the zoo tells ya?
That, that's the only thing the zoo's ever told me.
He said he liked that!! Oh you're right, you're right. I'm sorry.
Hey, y'know what? This is your fault! You're the one that didn't move his-his appointment.
Oh, it's my fault?! You didn't have to massage him! You could've sent him away! You could've not rolled Tonka trucks up and down his back!
Dude, what are you massaging an old man for?
His daughter was hot.
I, I know it's big, I just didn't know it was uh, ha-ha big.
And that's, that's funny why?
Well it's not, honey I'm sorry, I guess I'm just nervous. I mean, it's you, ya know, it's us. I mean, we're crossing that line, sort of a big thing.
OK.
OK, my hands were no where near your butt.
Ah y'know, this building is on my paper route so I...
Hi!
What are you doing here?
Oh.
Hi.
What? Oh yeah, yeah I think so. Why am I invited to this again?
Oh.
Hey, so can you make it on Friday?
Well apparently Albert has no friends. He's very excited about the bachelor party though. I think actually the only reason he's getting married is so he can see a stripper.
A stripper at a bachelor party, that is so clich. Why don't you get a magician?!
We know you took so just-just save yourself the time and confess!
Wait, you guys think I stole some ring?
Yeah!
Okay, who are you? The Hardy boys? Look, I don't need to steal some stupid ring, all right? I make $1,600 a week doing what I do; any of you guys make that?
Marry me.
Okay, so on our no-date evening, three of you now have dates.
Ooh ooh ooh ooh, there's no room for milk!
There. Now there is.
Uh, four.
Four.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I got to get to the museum. So um, I'll see you tonight.
Really? Mine too.
Hey cool, mine too.
OK.
Bye guys.
Umm, okay, yeah, sure. But wh-what's wrong with Monica and Chandler?
Oh my God! Of course, of course. Umm, would you please excuse me for a moment? Umm, do you know each other's hometowns? Why don't you... Wh-what's going on?
Well, umm, not much. But, I was just thinking that since those guys just got engaged that maybe it would be nice if they had some privacy, y'know? So, could I just move in with you for a couple days?
Nothing-Why?!
Phoebe, you said it was urgent!
Yeah, little change in plans. Ahh, we're gonna break-up instead.
Oh!
So, what are you doing here? I thought tonight was your big anniversary dinner.
Oh, and I can also speak a little French. Voulez-vous coucher avec moi ce soir? Why? What did I say?
Well, you just asked if I wanted to go to bed with you tonight.
Yeah, none of us have to deal with pressure at our jobs.
Look, don't worry. Okay? You're gonna be fine.
There's just so much pressure. I mean no offense, but what you guys do is very different. I don't know if you'd understand.
Yes, Fran. I know what time it is, but I'm looking at the WENUS and I'm not happy!
Alright, well I'm tearing the lettuce.
You don't want to believe me, I'm Mr. Funny to you. Mr. Funny...
We're kidding!
Ross, don't. Ross!
Whoa!!
Whoa, sorry Tommy.
Look, that was supposed to be like a private, personal thing between us.
Oh, she didn't think it would be that big of deal.
Okay, who are you talking to when you do that?
Okay, Ross, Phoebe is my girlfriend, okay, we tell each other everything. You know, I mean, come on, guys do the same thing, I mean, what about all that locker room stuff.
That's different, okay. That's like, uh 'Who dated a stripper?' or 'Who did it on the back of the Staton Island Ferry?'.
And for the record, it took two people to break up this relationship!!
Coffee house?
You bet.
Yeah! You and that girl from that copy place, which yesterday you took full responsibility for!!
I didn't know what I was taking full responsibility for! Okay?! I didn't finish the whole letter!
Oh I'm, I'm making this too hard. Okay, what do you want me to do.
Okay, it's not, it's not.
Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight over and over again, Ross, no, you're, you're, you're making this too hard.
I don't know, I don't know. Urrrgh! Look, maybe we should take a break.
Okay, okay, fine, you're right. Let's ah, let's take a break, let's cool off, okay, let's get some frozen yogart, or something..
Yeah but, on the bright side, we get to be roommates again.
You're never gonna believe it uh, Monica and Chandler are moving in again. That's great news right-I mean for them. Right?
Oh wow.
Yeah. Y'know umm, uh, umm, about that, umm, Ross I really appreciate your offer to let me move in and everything, but don't you think it's gonna be weird?
Wh-why?! Why-why-why would it, why would it be weird?
Hey. So I uh, I didn't get that apartment. Some problem with my application.
Hey!
Hey!
You're kidding!
You're kidding, no!
That's right, you're gonna spend tomorrow at Aunt Rachel's, aren't you.
They're still just friends, right?
And I will see you tomorrow!
Oh, hang on, hang on. Does Aunt Monica get a say in this?
'Pwease, Aunt Monica, pwease?' Oh, unclench. You're not even gonna be there.
??? Thro up a thro thro--a thro thro!
Ok, well, if you do take him out for his walk, you might wanna bring his hat, and there's extra milk in the fridge, and there's extra diapers in the bag.
Hat, milk, got it.
Consider it done.
You understood that?
No! Pick me! I don't want to end up an old maid!
Phoebe you can't have both of them! You have to pick one!
Pick me!!
All right well let's see, Ross is a good father, but Joey has a boat-This is hard!
This is crazy! Hey look, I wanna switch to Rachel!
Okay, well, if she always behaves like this, why don't you say something?
Chandler, can I just say something? I-I know you're still mad at me, I just wanna say that there were two people there that night. Okay? Two sets of lips.
Yes, well, I expect this from her. Okay? She's always been a Freudian nightmare.
Because it's complicated, it's complex- Hey, you kissed my mom!
We're rehearsing a Greek play.
Yeah but after you said it was okay, I figured, "Why not?!"
Oh wow! I mean, wow! I mean, I-I-I think she's cute but I-I would never have thought of going out with her, never!
Really?!
Oh so-so not really never.
I have to say you are a much bigger person than I am. I mean after all we've been through, I just-y'know I wish I had a brother to reciprocate. Hey, if you ever want to go out with Monica, you have my blessing.
Okay, I'm gonna get your coat and then I'll-I'll put you in a cab.
Okay.
I really do.
Okay. Oh wait, wait-wait, you're not gonna come with me?
Of course I am. I just have to make a call.
I've no idea, could be. Listen, I'm sorry I had to work tonight.
Well uh, you see that, that little cluster of stars next to the big one? That is Ursa Major.
Really?
Oh it's OK. You were worth the wait, and I don't just mean tonight.
You're not laughing.
Dollars? You spent $1200 dollars on a plastic bird?
Hey hold on, hold on. How much for the uh, how much to save the bird?
1200.
Uhhh, I was an impulse buyer, near the register.
Go ahead, go ahead with the bird. Ok, do you have anything for around 200?
No Phoebe, don't look! You don't want to see what's under there!!
Well, the giraffe's okay. And so is the pirate.
Ohh. What is this?
Ohh, the-the Foster puppets!
It's not a big deal. It's, just it's right here, and it's all the time.
Oh, you know, I'm just gonna, I'm gonna hang out, work on my music.
You look pretty tonight.
Oh, thanks. So, uh, what are you gonna do this summer?
Is my hook unhooked? These things keep falling down, I can't. . .
Uh, hold, let me see, I don't know. So what're you gonna do. . .
Alright. There's a theory, put forth by Richard Leakey-
We're kidding. C'mon, tell us!
Yeah! C'mon!
Tah-daaah!
Are we greeting each other this way now? 'Cause I like that.
Well, you were right. How can they do this to us, huh? It's Thanksgiving.
Good luck, man. I hope you get it.
Thanks.
Ok, I'll tell you what. How about I cook dinner at my place? I'll make it just like Mom's.
Will you make the mashed potatoes with the lumps?
There's no 'or' in mind. What is wrong with these pants?!!
No. I'm saying it's now.
Or?
It's not the pants. It's you that is backwards. And if, and if you don't understand how important this is to me, well then, perhaps we shouldn't get married at all!
No, wait! Emily! No, wait, stop! Emily, please-
Monica's crying. She's very upset about this whole Clunkers thing.
Um, in Phoebe's room. You can't go in there.
Why not?
Well, I, I should go in there.
No. No, no. She doesn't want to see you right now.
Y'know of-officer I uh...I had the weirdest dream last night...
I mean you're not gonna give me a-a ticket for driving too slow are ya?
That's right.
Oh my God!
Your license please.
You're gonna be a party person! Those guys rock the most!
Ah, you're still just a little fat girl inside aren't you?
Well I'm gonna be on it this year. I'm gonna be one of the party people.
Well they said I should bring someone. Do you wanna be my dance partner?
Totally! I would love to spend New Year's with you.
C'mon Monica, do it. Hey, you guys, um, Monica has some news.
Emotional hell. So, did they lend you the money yet?
No, but that's probably 'cause I haven't asked them yet.
Um, yeah, so uh, uhh, listen, I'm sorry I didn't tell you this before but umm, I, I'm no longer at my job, I, I had to leave it.
Why?
I told Emily to come. And I just need to y'know, talk to Rachel about it.
Damn!
What's going on?
Wait a minute! So when Emily comes you're just, you're not gonna see Rachel anymore?
Well look, I'm just trying to focus on the "I get to see my wife," part, all right? And not the part that makes me do this.
Years and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees...
Yeah!
Come on Ben.
Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas!
Santa!
You're fast and irresponsible. That adds up to a bad driver.
Only way to fly.
Come on Ross give me the keys! Monica does not know what she's talking about! I am an excellent driver!
Well in High School, that added up to head cheerleader.
Did you see the look that girl just gave me? Huh? She must've seen me cruising in the bad boy.
Oh my god! I'm so sorry, Cheryl. I must have freaked out.
Oh, Ross!
Wait! No! No! It's my hamster! It's Mitzi!
Oh, thank god, it's not Mitzi. It's just a rat.
I did it! Oh! I finished it! I did it all by myself! And there's nobody to hug!
Listen, I'm- I'm sorry I was so hard on you before, it's just I...
It'll be nice to get this off finally, won't it? Yes it will. Or we can leave it on for now, that's fine.
Y'know, with the right pair of pumps, that would be a great little outfit.
Oh, Ross, c'mon. It's my fault, I almost lost your...
Yeah, but you were the one who got him back, y'know? You, you were great. ...Hey, we uh, we still have that, uh, that bottle of wine. You in the mood for, uh, something grape?
No, I missed and hit the door. But, it opened really hard!
I'm not proving anything. Okay, I'm done listening to you. If I hadn't let you talk me into going to the airport in the first place, I never would've put my fist through the wall!
You put your fist through the wall?
You have to go to London!
What?
Oh y'know what, girls don't like it when I start talking about science.
Yeah, well what about you? You weren't you know, so hot in college either. After everything he said, he'd go "ba dum bum chessh"
Yeah, Monica doesn't like that either, Maybe I should stop doing that.
That's not specific to girls.
This is great, this is great, what else, what else?
Well uh, it's cause he had a thing with, wi-, with the thing.
Yeah, well me too, yeah. I think that's the challenge.
Hey, how come, uhh, Chandler didn't come?
Right, I go-, I got it.
So why don't ya show us the rest of your casa?
Thanks? But I have plans; Elizabeth and I are going out of town.
Hey!
Hey Ross listen Chandler got you out of going to the lesbian sandwich museum this weekend!
Oh that's great!
Yeah.
Well for starters, you may want to light it and lose the spatula.
Look. Joey, do you know we can see you from here?
How come Richard looks so much cooler with one of these than me?
You know what, I think it's cute, you trying to be more like Richard.
Not like him, per-se, just not un-like him.
That, that is funny... .... and Rachel keeps touching him.
No, I mean tonight, in the building. Suddenly. Into our lives.
Well, the cat... the cat turned out to be Paolo's cat!
Alright. I looked all over the building and I couldn't find the kitty anywhere.
Oh, I found him. He was Paolo's cat.
So the first time you ask a guy out, he-he turns you down?
Okay, for next time, what do you say?
I have an extra ticket. An extra ticket. Not, two tickets, I have an extra ticket.
He didn't turn me down! He's at the game isn't he? I got the date, I'm just not on it!
Okay, it's ready. Come on.
Well how much time before she absolutely has to start getting ready?
Well, can't you at least stall her a little? I'll-I'll go back to some of the places I went last night.
All right, well how much time do you need?
One hour.
Give me two.
The game, Rachel, the game. You owe us money for the game.
Settle what?
The... Jamestown colony of Virginia. You see, King George is giving us the land, so...
Oh. Right.
You know what, you guys? It's their first time, why don't we just forget about the money, alright?
When you put a 'D' at the end of 'Fine' you're not fine.
I'm gonna grab you some tissue.
I don't need a tissue! I'm fine-d!
I'm fine-d. I'm fine-d! Y'know, it's a really hard word to say.
Yes?
Yeah, so if you haven't already had it, chances are you're gonna get it.
Well, I just spoke to Carol. Ben's got the chicken pox.
Oh no.
Well I've had it.
Yeah, I've had it.
Look, we do not repel women OK? That is completely untrue.
Hey, I've been married 3 times
No-no-no I've seen it happen, you-you get a rapport going with a woman but somehow you manage to kill it. What's your secret?
Oh no, yes we do my man. Remember when we were back in college and we went to that spring dance and you walked right up to that girl you liked and you could not stop talking about the Irish potato famine?
Yeah, well what about you? You weren't you know, so hot in college either. After everything he said, he'd go "ba dum bum chessh"
We met at Phoebe's birthday party, I'm, I'm Ross Geller.
Jasmine?
Uh-huh.
You did a bad thing!
Yes, I did.
I know, but ahhhhhh!! I really wanna go up there and finish that kiss!
That's not true! Her, she doesn't even know what she wants! Rachel's still mad about the whole thing.
Okay, then you gotta back away, all right? You don't need that kind've hurt. Take it from a guy who's never had a long term relationship......
Hey!
Ahhhh!
Oh wait-wait-wait! The message is blinking. Maybe you didn't erase it.
Hey, thanks Rach.
Ohh, honey no problem. Okay.
Oh?
"Hey Ross, it's you!" Oh yeah, no that's-that's an old message, nobody needs to hear that.
Yeah. Yeah, actually um, I wanted to talk to you about that whole annulment thing?
Hey!
Hey, hubby!
Uh-huh.
I'm not going to do that.
I don't know! Just-just talk to him-entertain him and keep him alive.
Rach, he's not an ex-con.
Okay. Okay. Okay. Uh, what do I, what do I do with him?
Okay.
Okay. Ben? Come here. All right, I'm gonna leave you here with Aunt Rachel for about an hour. Okay? Are you gonna be okay?
Yes, yes, fine, that is my penis. Can we be grown-ups now?
That little naked guy would be me.
Aww, look at the little thing.
Who are those people?
Got me.
You're sure? Nobody uh, handed out uh, mints or anything?
Was there...uh, huh, huh, huh... andybody, anybody else there.
No.
No, it was just the three of us.
Huh!
"Hi Rach, are you there? It's me, pick up. Rachel. Rach!"
Oh my, would you look at that!
"Hi, it's me, I'm coming over now. Hey, what if I'm already there when your playing this message?" Is that too spooky?
What?!
Nevermind.
Shielding your face and shrieking like a girl... is not a backhand.
Just admit it Chandler, you have no backhand.
Excuse me little one, I have a very solid backhand.
I was shrieking... like a Marine.
All right here. Watch me execute the three 'P's of championship play. Power. Precision. and penache.
Oh great. So all I need to do is get some new skin. Thank you.
I don't know what I'm going to do. That date starts in like an hour.
Hey Ross, maybe if your skin was lighter. Your teeth wouldn't look so bright.
I'm just saying, if we put just a little bit of makeup on you.
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. We're not 13 anymore.
Well, you know, I'd feel a whole lot better if you got dressed now.
No, four minutes ago you had a half hour, we have to be out the door at twenty to eight.
Relax Ross, we'll be ready. It only takes us two minutes to get dressed.
Okay.
Hey-hey! Oh, look at you, all sexy.
How come it's always us left in the field holding the ball?
No! You let go!
No!
I don't know. I guess the other people just don't care enough.
Hey! It's starting to snow.
What? No! Of course, of course I do! Are-are they gone?
Nothing, I'm-I'm just, I'm so comfortable with you!
Do you not want to be seen with me?
Uh no, they're still here but I think I'm about to leave.
What?! No! No! Wait! You're right, this is stupid. Who cares what people think? I mean, I mean we like each other right? There's nothing wrong with that. Come on. Burt? Lydia? Mel? This is Elizabeth.
No, I mean tonight, in the building. Suddenly. Into our lives.
So, um... where did Paolo come from?
Oh... Italy, I think.
Well, the cat... the cat turned out to be Paolo's cat!
That, that is funny... .... and Rachel keeps touching him.
Uh, actually mom, I think Monica thanked him for the both of us.
Happy birthday.
Well, you kids thank Dr. Burke for the ride?
Well, you kids take the train in?
No, Richard Burke gave them a ride.
So, do we really have to ask who's going up on the platform next?
Okay, let's do it. Mom and Dad are gonna be so faced!
5 6 7 8!
Oh no! You get up there and do that again exactly like that!
Yes!
Joey, had an imaginary childhood friend. His name was?
No, 19.
Thanks man.
Maurice.
Correct, his profession was?
Come on that's not fair! I mean you haven't even heard me play!
Why not?
Because we hate them.
We have heard you play.
No, you've heard my practice. Okay? Just-just give me a chance to perform for you and then decide whatever you want. And I'm not going to tell you what song I'm gonna play either. But uh, let's just say when it's over I'll bet there will be a we bit o' celebration.
So um...Thanksgiving. The holiday season is upon us, hm?
Okay...
What's up, Ross?
Yeah!
And um...You look nice today.
Way to go guys. Y'know, you-you were really good at the stuff too.
Yeah?
Uh-huh.
Oh, I know. Hey, y'know what we never did? Oh no, not that. We uh, we never had bonus night!
A what?
Well, ya know, they're a little behind the times in Colonial Williamsburg.
Uh, we're going down to Colonial Williamsburg.
Yeah, a woman I went to college with just became the first female blacksmith down there.
Think I better go before mommy starts weeping.
Buy mommy.
Ah no. I don't, but it could not have been more than sixty.
Good evening officer.
Do you know how fast you were traveling back there?
You're right. It was 37.
I mean you're not gonna give me a-a ticket for driving too slow are ya?
I don't know what I'm going to do. That date starts in like an hour.
Ohhh.
Okay, maybe this will make your teeth look less white. Nope. Okay, colors that don't work are blue, yellow, green, red, black, white, orange, and purple.
Hey Ross, maybe if your skin was lighter. Your teeth wouldn't look so bright.
Oh great. So all I need to do is get some new skin. Thank you.
Well I am that. And that whole rage thing is definitely behind me.
A new place for a new Ross. I'm gonna have you and all the guys from work over once it's y'know, furnished.
I must say it's nice to see you back on your feet.
I wonder if its time for you to rejoin our team at the museum?
Oh Donald that-that would be great. I am totally ready to come back to work. I-What? No! Wh... What are you doing?!! GET OFF MY SISTER!!!!!!!!!!!!!
You're welcome, Ben. Merry Christmas, ooh, and Happy Hanukkah!
That's right, Ben. I'm Santa's representative for all the southern states. And Mexico! But, Santa sent me here to give you these presents, Ben. Maybe the Lady will help me with these presents.
Wow! Thanks!
Are you for Hanukkah, too? Because I'm part-Jewish.
You are? Me, too!
Okay, this play, I want you to do a down and out to the right. Okay. Break!
I almost caught that one!
Great! Now, the score is 7 to almost 7.
Wait, what am I gonna do?
You, you go long.
Oh my God, oh- is today the twentieth, October twentieth?
So, I'm guessing you had an extra ticket and couldn't decide which one of you got to bring a date?
Well, aren't we Mr. "The glass is half empty."
Oh, I was hoping you wouldn't remember.
Ohhh.
Yeah the dad and Ben eat soup and pretend to enjoy it.
Weirder than watching his two moms make out?
Whoa-whoa dad? There's a dad in the commercial?
Whoa, hey, maybe I'll go down there with ya and see if I can get an audition to play the dad. I mean who better to play Ben's father than his godfather.
You're not his godfather.
God, I don't believe this. She could be giving birth in the cab.
I'm gonna be in the waitin' room, handing out cigars.
Yes, Joey's made arrangements to have his baby in a movie from the 50's.
Oh, Ross, relax. It's probably like two dollars for the first contraction, and then fifty cents for each additional contraction.
What, it's ok when Chandler does it?
I don't know, I'm one sorry polentologist. All right Joey, we get it. I'm sorry.
Maybe it was both of us, but we had our best friend's interest... But we had our best friend's interest at heart.
Could I be more sorry.
I'm sorry too.
Oh no! No-no, keep reading! The good part's coming up. Keep going.
Nothing, ah there was this thing at the museum. Come on. Easy.
Oh, it was, nah, well....
What thing? What thing?
Okay, now when you come back I hope you remember that, that chick is not a toy!
What thing? What is this thing?
Yeah, he's a little sensitive right now, `cause he's so in love.
Come on, Pheebs lay off him.
Thank you, Ross.
All right.
Ohh!
Thank you! And I have to say that first scene when you meet Mac...
There was just an explosion, okay? My hearing would be impaired.
I thought you were excellent! In fact for a minute there I was like, "Ooh, where'd Ross go?"
Yeah?
Oh my God. I mean...
No, we-we're gonna be like best friends, that's why it's gonna be weird.
Yeah, it is.
Yeah. It's gonna be weird.
Oh, oh, I thought we were just talking.
Hey!
I don't know, I mean you were a lot bigger, I mean, stronger back then.
'Cos I was gonna say there's no way you could've done the end the way you guys did it back then!
What? We could do it!
I can do it, okay? Come on, let's go.
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
Wow, this cologne really is every bit as good as Georgio.
Okay. Okay fine, y'know what? We will let Ross and Joey decide. Hiiiii, Ross! Sweetie.
Hey there, you handsome thing.
Hi.
Just uh, brought back your videos.
Hop in. Get ready for the smoothest ride of your life.
Really! God Ross, what were you thinking? I know it's really shallow, but a part of me wants him again.
Oh, well get in line missy. So, can I have a ride stud?
Damnit!
Okay, who's next?
Well, what is she goes down and-and sleeps with a bunch of guys?
Then what am I supposed to do?
Nothing, you just have to be cool with it.
Well, maybe you don't marry this one.
I'm so glad you're going on this trip!
Hey, can I, can I get in on that? Because I'm kinda hungry myself.
No, not the used wax.
Because that would be crazy?
Fine. Hi! Yes, I'd like to order a large pizza.
No anchovies.
'Cause I know what you're trying to pull here. Okay? It's not gonna work.
Uh-hmm, yeah-yeah do you like it? Do-do you looove it? I just want you to know that I'm changing your grade back.
What?! Why?
I'm not trying to pull anything. Look I love you dude.
Y'know what? I-I'm not even gonna talk about this. Okay? This little thing is over. I know you have a girlfriend! Okay--Yeah! And I know about the other professors! How do you think that makes me feel Ned?! You used me! You don't love me and you never did! Ah Professor Winston, Professor Fredrickson, I'll be right with you. Don't make this worse and I'll give you a C. Shall we?
Yes, yes I am, one of the many things I'm feeling. Well....
Yeah!
You must be so happy!
Good luck, with your girlfriend.
Oh, thank you. Hey, hey. Rachel!!!!
Okay, that-that's enough! Y'know, let's, let's let someone else play.
Yay! Emily!
What are the odds? What are the odds?
If you didn't want to play, why did you come to the party?
Okay, my turn!!
Listen, I got to tell you I've-I've never been to a guru before, so...
Hi.
I am Guru Saj.
Well, relax. If it makes you feel better, I've attended some of the finest medical schools in Central America. Well then, let's take a look at this skin abnormality of yours. Come on, have a seat. Eeh, huh. As I suspected, it's a koondis!
What's a koondis?
Oh, oh that's right, I forgot about your ability to fuse metal.
I'll call the super.
Here, let me try.
Hey, it's Funny's cousin, Not Funny.
Hi, Mr. Treeger. Hi, it's Rachel Green from upstairs. Yes, somebody, uh, broke our knob on the radiator and it's really hot in here. Yes, it's, it's hot enough to bake cookies. Well, do you think we could have a new one by 6? Wha t, no, no, Tuesday, we can't wait until Tuesday, we're having a party tonight.
Question two. Why do we always have to have parties with committees?
Question. Why do we always have to have parties where you poach things?
You wanna be in charge of the food committee?
Really. Why can't we just get some pizzas and get some beers and have fun?
Yeah.
And while that was good advice, you should know that what-what she wants...
Okay, y'know how you told me I should do whatever it takes to fix my marriage?
Yeah, I told you to give Emily whatever she wants.
Yeah?
...is for me not to see you anymore.
This is so exciting, I haven't seen my monkey in almost a year.
She's here.
Sometimes men love women, sometimes men love men, and then there are bisexuals, though some just say they're kidding themselves. la la-la-la la-la-la-la-la-la-la...
What, you never look down in the shower? Oh please. I'm not allowed to make one joke in the monkey-is-penis genre?
C'mon people, back up please, back up, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon.
Yeah. Yeah. Yes, this place is beautiful. Emily's parents got married here.
Um-hmm! Doesn't that sound delicious at the last minute?
Yeah, y'know, but something like salmon which would be so much more elegant than the chicken. And, you wouldn't have to worry about the salmonella. But of course with salmon you'd have to worry about the chickenella... So, I can't wait to see this place you're getting married!
I still can't believe they're tearing it down. It really is the most lovely building you'll ever see. I mean it's over... Oh my God!
It's nice.
Sure! Hey, I just found out, I get Ben for the holidays this year.
Hey!
Licorice?
Ohh! That's great!
Are you gonna dress up as Santa?
Wha, OK, I'm sorry, let's uh, why don't we find someplace else.
I'm done.
Yeah well, you know what, so is uh, Sorentino's.
No, you know what, it's late, everything's gonna be closed. Why don't we just do it another night?
No, no, we won't.
Look, Carol never threw me out of a room before you came along.
Please. This is so your fault.
How, how is this my fault?
Yeah? Well, there's a lot of things Carol never did before I came along.
You tryin' to be clever? A funny lady?
Sometimes, you should come over sometime! I'll play you one of my other...
1987, the day after Christmas, at Sean McMahon's party. I played you one of my songs, y'know Interplanetary Courtship Ritual.
Oh yeah. Right. So now, are-do you, do you still do music?
Oh my God! Joey Tribbiani from Days of Our Lives, just walked in here!
Rach, he's a friend of ours.
I don't know, you don't wanna mess with corn nuts. They're craaazy.
I can't believe you would actually say that. I would much rather be Mr. Peanut than Mr. Salty.
No way! Mr.Salty is a sailor, all right, he's got to be, like, thetoughest snack there is.
Oh my God. You guys! You gotta come see this! There's some creep out there with a telescope!
I can't believe it! He's looking right at us!
Not for tonight. Not for tonight! Wh-what, what, what, are you doing?
Oh, it's perfect! But not for tonight.
Well, of course not for tonight. Yeah, hi!
No honey, we're sorry, we didn't mean it. I love you. I love you.
We used them as pillows when we went camping.
According to Chandler, what phenomenon scares the bejeezus out of him?
That's correct. Ladies?
Same category?
Michael Flatley, Lord of the Dance!
That is correct.
Probably. But you know, I'll tell you something. Passion is way overrated.
And you didn't marry him because...?
I mean, do you think there are people who go through life never having that kind of...
Yeah right.
It is. Eventually, it kind of... burns out. But hopefully, what you're left with is trust, and security, and... well, in the case of my ex-wife, lesbianism. So, you know, for all of those people who miss out on that passion... thing, there's all that other good stuff.
The guy who took Rachel to the prom? Why is he calling you?
Good runnin' into you at the bank today, so ah, here's my number, 555-9323. Give me a call. Later.
Chip, is Chip Matthews.
'Cause I ran into him at the bank, he is still soo cute.
Monica, you're so lucky! He's like the most popular guy in school!!
Can I have everyone's attention please? I'm uh; I'm Ross Geller.
I'm Amanda.
Oh I get it! A...man...duh!
Doctor Ross Geller.
Dad...dad, please! As I was saying umm, I'm Dr. Ross Geller. Uhh, and I'm the best man. And uh, this marriage is doubly special for me umm, because not only is the groom my best friend but uh, the bride is my little sister. And, she's the greatest sister a guy could ask for. So if you'd all please join me in raising a glass to the, the couple we're here to celebrate. To the Bings.
Oh wait-hold it! But then I started thinking and I stopped the kissing.
Let me finish, okay? She started kissing me and-and I didn't stop it. I guess I-I just wasn't thinking...
Yeah that's right you weren't thinking! Y'know what? Let me give you something to think about!
Oh, well thank you for taking your tongue out of my sister's mouth long enough to tell me that.
Look I-I realize if anything were to happen with me and Jill then nothing could ever happen with us!
Hey! Hey! If he's moving, maybe I should try to get his place!
Ohh, I'm gonna miss that big old squishy butt.
And we're done with the chicken fried rice.
Good idea! Yes!
It would be so cool to live across from you guys!
Hey! Hey! Hey! I get to choose my best man, and I want both you guys.
No, you should.
Now, don't argue with me...
Really?
Really?
Alright, alright, now-now who should I say tricked me into doing it?
Okay, okay, I'll tell 'em it wasn't Chandler who got high. Now who should I say it was?
You! It's not like it's a big deal! You-you don't still do it or anything!
Dad, please don't pick your teeth out here! Alright, and if you're gonna put your feet up, why don't you sit on the-
Monica, leave him alone!
Monica! Stop throwing it so hard! We're on the same team!
Really?!
Uh-huh! I'm so...happy.
Four hours? You guys have been doing this for four hours?
That's right baby.
So they said our table will be ready in just a few minutes.
Well it's just while Monica and I were dancing to them it was...the first time I knew that...you were the woman I wanted to dance all my dances with.
Oh crap!
Oh great!
Yeah.
Oh, so-so you talked to her. Did she, did she sound mad?
Isn't Rachel supposed to be back by now?
Yeah, but her plane got delayed in Athens. But actually, she should be here by now.
No, but she likes me. You abandoned her on a plane to Greece.
Okay, I did not abandon Rachel! Okay? Emily showed up at the airport! I had to go after her! I mean, I-I did what I had to do! She's my wife! Rachel is my wife! Y'know-Emily! Emily, is my wife! Man, what is that?
It's a big deal to me. This is great, Monica. I really appreciate this.
So, uh, Jules tells me you guys are going shopping tomorrow?
Yeah, uh, it's actually not that big a deal.
You're welcome.
Woof, woof.
Uh, aside from that, the whole evening was pretty much a bust.
Oh yeah. I used to babysit him. Hey, how's his dad?
Uh, good.
Yeah, we really missed you guys.
Yeah, look, we were just saying, this whole thing is really stupid.
That's okay, I'm cool over here. I'll catch up with you later, Joey.
Maybe it's crazy in a perfect world, a world without lab coats and blazers, but you not in a perfect world, you in a museum now. See that scientist in the classes, he and I used to play together all the time in grade school, but now... Peter! Hey, Peter! It's me Rhonda! From PS-129! I shared my puddin' which you man! I gave you my Snack Pack! See, he pretend he don't even here me!
I-I think everybody's pretending they don't hear you. Anyway, look, I don't know about you and your jackets and your separate tables, but Ross is one of my best friends, and if I save him a seat, I'm telling you, he will sit in it! Ross! Ross! Over here, man! I-I saved you seat.
Op, this is saved. Gift shop.
Hey, uh, I'm really, really sorry about what happened in the cafeteria today.
For your information, it's a card sharp, not a card shark.
OK, noone is named Sleeve.
Phoebe, what the hell are you talking about? Other than their names being similar, I'm sorry, I do not see what you're seeing.
You could not be more wrong. You could try... but you would not be successful.
OK, I'm gonna get some more coffee before the pinching and eye-poking begins.
Beef in a dessert?! I- no no no, there is no way!
And while I'm gone don't you boys sneak a taste.
Okay.
I know, and only one layer of jam?! What is up with that?
Oh my God, the pages are stuck together!
Wow. Umm... Huh... I'm-I'm not sure what to do with that right now.
Go ahead.
Umm, okay, I think I'm-I'm just gonna-just gonna say it. Just gonna say it. Uhh, I'm still in love with you Ross.
What? What? Was that a joke? 'Cause it's mean.
I'm so dead serious. I'm totally serious.
That's it. I'm in my apartment, you're not there, we're not having this conversation.
OK. I'm in my apartment...
....yeah... what else?
Alright, look, I'll start, OK?
Joey, please.
Sure. Once, at work I-I thought carbon dating was fossilized...
Events from around the globe.
Okay. Uhh, Ross, y'know what, there's something that I-that I have to talk to you about and everybody's saying that I shouldn't tell you, but I think they're wrong. I mean, and you know how people can be wrong.
Okay, Ross, I'm really trying to tell you something here.
Yeah.
Wha-I'm having, I'm having a boy! Huh, am I having a boy?
I-I'm, I'm having a boy?
Uh...no. No, no, in fact, you're not having a boy.
Yes, you're having a boy!
I'm having a boy! Oh, I'm having a boy!
Maybe I'll take her to that new French restaurant down the street...
No Joey! Look why don't, why don't we just let her decide? Okay? Hey-hey, we'll each go out with her one more time. And-and we'll see who she likes best.
That sounds fair.
Ah yeah-wait a second now! Look we're gonna have to set a spending limit on the date. I don't have the money to take her to a fancy place like that.
Well sorry, that's what I do on dates.
I can't believe it. Can I tell you something? I'm a little mad at him now.
What?!
I know!
Can I tell you something? Me too.
Y'know what? He didn't want to talk to us about being angry, well maybe we don't talk to him at all!
Well umm, oh! I might be teaching another class this semester!
You want me to call her right now?
Oh no! No! No-no-no-no! No, I mean come on that's-that's crazy-I mean that's crazy. So what's-what's going on with you? What is going on with you?
Yeah do it now, call right now.
This is my favorite part.
No! No! No! The "Come here to me" is y'know for the ladies.
Yeah, I still don't know. I'm sorry I just wanna make sure that I bought the right couch. I need a couch that says, "Kids welcome here." But that also says, "Come here to me!"
What?! You say that to kids?!!
Ross, honey, it's a nice couch. It's not a magic couch.
You picked a great couch.
Does that mean the same thing in England as it does in America?
No, no, that-that, that's all right. Umm, I'm just glad you called.
Ross umm, there's something that I've got to tell you, there's-there's someone else.
She doesn't know which one of us she wants, me or this Colin guy.
This isn't how it's supposed to go, there can't be another guy.
Oh, I believe I had the half-drunk cappuccino with the lipstick on the rim.
Well, of course, lambs are scarier. Otherwise the movie would've been called Silence of the Ducks.
Ok, who ordered what?
Yes, and this with the cigarette butt in it, is that decaf?
Oh god.
Hmm-Hmm-Hmm. Me, neither. I've had a really good time too, you know.
Mmm.
You know, I rarely connect with someone this much on the first date.
Are you going to eat that bread?
Ohh, I just like the smell. Mmmm.
Don't yell at me okay, this is the most I've seen you all week.
What? Sophie, does she have ten minutes?
Hey, Ross!!! I told you I don't!
Look, I cannot do this right now, okay, I've got a deadline, would you just go home, I'll talk to you later.
Yeah, but wait...
Look, I'm not being any of those things, ok, I'm just being realistic.
Toilet paper?
Yeah.
Well knock it off, you're supposed to be my friend.
I am your friend.
Chandler?! You brought Chandler?! The next best thing would be Monica!
Well, I brought the next best thing.
Hey!
Y'know, I would be offended, but Monica is freakishly strong, so...
Look, I-I drew a sketch about how we're gonna do it. Okay Rach, that's you. That's the couch.
So Rachel called. Wants to see me. Going over in a minute.
Hello.
Hey!
Wow, what-what do you think she wants?
Well, maybe the crazy fog has lifted and she realises that life without me.... a-sucks.
Yes! That's where we realized we were both super cool people!
Okay. I did divert her and we ended up having a great time! Okay?
Watching ballroom dancing?
Well look-look, okay Ross, Kyle just told me some really bad stuff about her.
Like what?
Well this, this is too much, I feel like I should get you another sweater.
You got me a cola drink?
And, a lemon lime.
And last but not least.
They're ribbed for your pleasure.
I hate America! When I finish this game, I swear I am moving.
From you? Yes, please!
First of all, Utah? Dude, you can't just make stuff up!
Hey! Tag's still talking to the police.
Yeah, ohh! Why, damnit, why did I open my mouth? I have a crush on you; I am attracted to you. Gee, I-I know that I freaked him out
Yeah, y'know for dating, general merriment, taking back to your windmill...
What are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing?
Which do I like?
Well, if I had to chose right now, which by the way I find really weird, I would have to say, Chandler.
Yes!!
Wow, did not know that! May I say how lovely you look today?
Oh, what's at 8:00?
Oh, I have dinner plans with Joey. We get together about once a month to discuss the rest of you guys.
Duly noted.
Thanks. Oh! So for tomorrow, do you want to rent a car and drive down together or what?
Know what-If somebody doesn't tell me what's going on right now...
What?! What?! Talking about what?!
You don't know?
What? You'll hi-ya?
Monica's pregnant.
Well now let's-let's look at this objectively, I think I should date her...
Well obviously only one of us can keep dating her.
Obviously! So, how do we decide?
Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Or, or I'm the one who dates her.
That's interesting, but check this out. I date her...
You're taking the word of a guy who has night vision goggles?
Pheebs, this guy has been obsessed with your sister, for God knows how long, okay, you don't just give up something like that.
Look, he gave me his night vision goggles and everything.
What, he's not still following her. Do you think he is still following her?
Pheebs, wake up and smell the restraining order.
Look both, Joey and Monica feel the same way that I do. No-no-no-no.
Obviously not to Joey.
What?
Guys, guys, guess who I am?!
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!! Hey!!! Look what you're doing to Chandler!! Yeah, look, we know this is really, really hard for you guys. Okay? You don't, all right you don't have to love each other, okay? You don't, you don't even have to like each other much right now. But please, you have to figure out a way to be around each other.
OK, turn around. I just don't want you staring at me when I'm doing this.
Sure.
Well if you can't talk dirty to me, how're you going to talk dirty to her? Now tell me you want to caress my butt!
Alright, alright. I'm around. Go ahead.
Ahem... I want.... OK, I want to... feel your... hot, soft skin with my lips.
Well I'm, I'm a little slow. Just as our children would be.
Uh-huh! Uh-huh! And-and-and I'll always remember that summer because that's when I realized that we are related.
It took you that long to figure it out, huh?
Hi!
Hi!
You can't just call Godfather. Don't you think her brother should be Godfather?
Whoa-whoa-whoa! We're having kids?!
I call Godfather!
Sure, if you cared enough to call it first.
Guys, you're a few steps ahead of us.
Woah. Huh. You know about my, I mean, you know I had... you know?
You've had feelings for me?
Yeah, what, so? You had feelings for me first.
Chandler told me.
Chandler. When did he... when did he... when did he?
Are you sure? Great. Carol? Wanna come over and join us?
Now that is funny. Hey, do you think...would it be too weird if I invited Carol over to join us? 'Cause she's, she's alone now, and pregnant, and, and sad.
I guess.
Oh, no no no. I'm fine. I'm fine.
Come on. These people'll scooch down. You guys'll scooch, won't you? Let's try scooching! Come on. Come on. Uh, Kristen Riggs, this is Carol Willick. Carol, Kristin. Uh, Carol teaches sixth grade. And, Kristin, Kristin... ...does something that, funnily enough, wasn't even her major!
Well, you better hop outta the shower, cause... I gotta flush.
Me too.
Me too. Alright, whattaya got.
Well, well, well, hop back in bucko, cause I got four sixes! I won! I actually won! Oh my God! Y'know what? I think I'm gonna make a little Ross pile. I think that one was Ross's, and I thinkohthat one was Ross's. Yes! : Well, I have got your money, and you'll never see it...
And your fly's still open...
Flip me for it? No, no, no... heads, heads, heads!
I see. So what do you propose to do?
I will flip you for it.
On your back... Mom.
Alright, Mommies, take a nice deep cleansing breath.
Oh, you have to call the police! That's what I did to the kids in my building!
What's-what's going on?
The guys across the hall are throwing water balloons at us.
No, it's a water balloon fight! We started it!
Oh! Listen umm, I, I just stopped by to see if you wanted to see this play tonight. Umm, it's supposed to be excellent. The director is the same...
You had to be a bitch in high school, you couldn't've been fat.
Oh, c'mon, Luisa!
Sorry, prom queen.
Alright. In high school I was the prom queen and I was the homecoming queen and the class president and you... were also there! But if you take this monkey, I will lose one of the most important people in my life. You can hate me if you want, but please do not punish him. C'mon, Luisa, you have a chance to be the bigger person here! Take it!
Nope.
Like uh y'know like this! This! She-she could've made this!
Well, not right now. Okay look, Monica came here for some memories and damnit, we're gonna give her some! Okay, grab...grab some empty boxes. Okay? We'll-we'll take stuff from mine and whatever we can pass off as hers we'll-we'll put 'em in their.
Great!
Sure!
Right? And this! She-she could've won this!
So! Poetry? Susan's gay! They're being gay together!
So, I just picked up a message from Emily, she and Susan are going to a poetry reading together!
So?
Emily's straight.
Oh, wake up!
But now! I'm there! I'm totally there! I'm-I'm finally where you are!
Joshua...guy at that club, dancing and having a good time, the thought of it kinda...y'know.
Yeah, I...
Oh, thank goodness!
Yeah, and-and thank you for Emily.
No! And somehow, we ended up with a joint checking account.
Yes, I will tell her.
So you didn't leave the bank?
What are you ever gonna use that for?!
To pay for the gym.
What's a matter with me? You've got a black light. It's 1999!
I-I, did that for you.
What's a matter with you?
Kim, hi.
Hi Rachel. Ohh, I've been meaning to ask you. Have you seen the new Ralph Lauren sheets? Ohh, what am I thinking. Of course you have.
I don't care! I am not quitting! I insist on finishing this game!
What? No! No, I'm not stopping. I'm Red Ross!
Dude, if you go back out there, you're gonna be Dead Ross!
All right, all right, if you insist on doing this, at least let me help you.
No, God no! That is no place for a woman. Those guys will grab anything.
Okay, but just the jacket. Double-oh and seven are not gettin' in there.
What are you kidding? It's Batman's tux!!
Let me try it on!
Okay. Holy double-vented comfort Batman! What's this?
What?
Phoebe, 800 is toll free, 801 is-is Utah.
Phoebe, it's been two days.
Yeah, I know. Oh, good thing it's one of those 801 numbers. Right?
No, no, no, oh no-no-no, it's has to be 800. 'Cause all those big companies have 800 numbers, every one. Yeah, every big Utah-based company has one.
Phoe-be!!
I had a dream last night where I was playing football with my kid.
You are an idiot. .
yep, that's me, I am that stupid .
That's nice.
No, no, with him. I'm on this field, and they, they hike me the baby... and I, I know I've gotta do something 'cause the Tampa Bay defence is comin' right at me.
What can I do, she doesn't listen to me about renter's insurance either.
So, why do you let her go to a chiropractor for?
I'm sorry, let her?
Wait a minute, you don't have renter's insurance?!
No.
Okay. I did divert her and we ended up having a great time! Okay?
Hi! I'm sorry, but can you give me a second while I talk to this woman, who by the way did not spend the night.
Sure.
Watching ballroom dancing?
Yes! That's where we realized we were both super cool people!
Oh, and she's pregnant with my baby. I always forget that part. Helloo!
Wow, uh, anything else I should know?
Nope, nope, that's it.
Ok, so now we need, um sage branches and the sacramental wine.
All I have is, is oregano and a Fresca.
Oh my God, he just said your name, that's great! Good job Ben.
What'd you do, take him whaling?
Monica.
Monica bang!
Oh that's right, that's what I'd sound like if I exploded.
Are you saying your kid eats soup better than my kid?
And why wouldn't he get it?
Oh, come on! Have you seen what my kid can do?! Huh?! I mean he dials phones! He-he-he eats tortilla chips! He-he plays soccer with the cartoon tiger!
You just give him a spoon baby!
Oh yeah? I guess we'll just see!
Yeah, I'm gonna stay and read my book. I just wanna be alone right now.
Uh actually, I think I'm gonna skip it.
Really?
Oh. Are you sure you don't want to come? Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan, they get mail and stuff.
That's okay, Joe.
So you guys having any luck getting rid of the entertainment center?
Yeah. Just, if it's possible, could you leave him somewhere and go have sex with another guy?
I'll try.
Well, there were a couple of calls last night, but ah, I don't think any of them are gonna work out.
Yes, Joey has a very careful screening process. Apparently, not everyone is qualified to own wood and nails.
OK.... um, a weird thing happened to me on the train this morning...
You know, I don't mean to brag, but I waited tables at Innsbruck in '76. Amouz-bouche?
Talk to me.
No no no. Talk... dirty.
Wha... what, here?
You know what, I think we've had all the bad luck we're going to have.
It was...This disagreement over... My god. You...you look beautiful.
Ohh... Oh! You were not meant to see me before the wedding. It's bad luck.
My God. Rachel! Your here. I can't believe it. What happen? Why are you here?
Well I just came... I just needed to tell you... Congratulations.
Uh, no, no, see, because not...not all guys are going to be a Paolo.
See, Rach, uh, see, I don't think that swearing off guys altogether is the answer. I really don't. I think that what you need is to develop a more sophisticated screening process.
No. I just need to be by myself for a while, you know? I just got to figure out what I want
No, I know, I know, and I'm sure your little boy is not going to grow up to be one.
What?
Look, I am totally, totally over her, OK, I just... : Hiiii!
Who?
Dee, the sarcastic sister from Whats Happening.
Hi! How are you?
We're fine, we're fine.
What does this mean? What do you, I mean do you wanna, get back together?
You still love me?
Noo.
Noo! Maybe! I, I don't know.
What?!
All right, show's over. Nothing to see here. Ok, let's do laundry.
Hey, hey, hey, her stuff wasn't in it.
Hey, hey, hey, that's not the rule and you know it.
That was amazing. I can't even send back soup.
Well, that's because you're such a sweet, gentle, uh...Do you, uh, do you...Oh, hey, uh you must need detergent.
What do you mean, they're not moving in? They-they're still moving in right?
Hey! Oh listen, I was just clearing some space for your stuff.
Oh thanks, but listen, I was just at Monica's and she and Chandler had a big fight and they're not moving in.
No-no, they just had a big blowout over what to do with my room.
What?! Over a stupid room!
You know, Barracuda was the first song I learned to play on the keyboard.
You forget how many great songs Heart had.
Yeah.
So, you heard it, you repeated it, so that must mean you wrote it.
Oh, you guys, with this joke. I gotta say, I know I cracked up, but I'm not even sure I got it.
Disneyland, 1989, 'It's a Small World After All.'
Oh... Milwaukee.
Um... Ross?
No way!
The ride broke down. So, Carol and I went behind a couple of those mechanical Dutch children... then they fixed the ride, and we were asked never to return to the Magic Kingdom.
Oh. Wow! Huh. Boy! Well, someone's been doing their homework.
So honey this uh, this threesome thing umm, I mean how-how are you gonna start to find...
Ooh, actually I've been making a list of all the women I know who might be into doing this!
Yeah. Ooh, and I know Gail Rosten is in there twice, but she is so...
Oh, I know. Y'know, just-just talking about it is getting me kinda...
Whoa-whoa-whoa, hey! Now remember what we talked about, you gotta be strong.
Go!!
All right, all right, all right. I mean I'll have to check with him first, but I'll think he'll be cool with it.
Yes. Yes!
One more time, "Hey, don't you want a washboard stomach and rock hard pecs?"
Mike "Gandolf" Ganderson, only like the funest guy in the world.
Dude, we are sooo gonna party!
Wow! Okay, dude alert! And who is this guy?
I'm gonna call and get off work tomorrow!
I'm gonna call after you!
Okay. Wow! This is going so well. Did you see us? Did you see?
Hey, would you ah, would you like some juice?
I'd love some juice. Thanks.
Yeah honey, I'm standing right there! Why didn't you just tell him about the mole I haven't got checked yet.
Excellent!
Uh, if you guys don't mind, I'd like to take a moment, just me and him.
That was good.
Marcel, this is for you. It's, uh, just, y'know, something to, um, do on the plane.
Oh, sure. Sure, absolutely.
Marcel, c'mere, c'mere. Well buddy, this is it. There's just a coupla things I want to say. I'm really gonna miss you, and I'm never gonna forget about you. You've been more than just a pet to me, you've been more like a be- Okay, Marcel, please, could you leave my leg alone? Could you just stop humping me for two seconds?! Marcel, would- okay, just take him away. Just take him.
Did you see me? I was pretty good, huh? That is one fun game!
No offence but, y'know sometimes it's hard to understand you, y'know with the accent, so...
That's just halftime, there's more of this.
Right.
Hey, could you do me a favour? Could you just grab me a bottle of water?
As in, "I now pronounce you wife and wife" married?
Ok.
We're uh, we're getting married.
Anyway, we'd like you to come, but we totally understand if you don't want to.
Why wouldn't I want to come? I had fun at the first wedding.
Thank you, but I want to remove it Pheebs. I don't want to make it savory.
Wait-wait-wait! Wait!!
I'm telling you, if you want to take care of that thing, you should go to my herbal guy.
Y'know when girls sleep with guys with weird things on their body, they tell their friends about it.
Gimme this.
No, it's my joke, it's mine. You can call them, they'll tell you.
Hey guys.
Hey, Joey, Playboy printed my joke.
It's my joke.
It's my joke.
What? What? What?! You guys knew? You all knew and you didn't tell me?!!
My best friend and my sister! I cannot believe this. You guys probably wanna get some hugs in too, huh? Big news!
Awww, no, it's okay, we've actually known for a while.
Well, Ross, we were worried about you. We didn't know how you were going to react.
You were worried about me? You didn't know how I was going to react?
You didn't want to share your tomatoes, tomatoes are very important to you.
And that's bad because..., you hate chicken piccata?
Noo.
No, it's like all of the sudden, we were this couple. And this alarm started going off in my head 'Run for your life! Get out of the building!'
Men are unbelievable.
Well that's different! Okay? Because he, he was actually in love with me!
No!
Well why not you changed Ned's grade!
No he's not! He's totally yanking your chain! He's done this with three other teachers!
What?
Right. So is it gonna be like 'I'm abandoning you while your upset.'
Okay. You know that I-I have to go.
Um, hum.
No.
No, because your not upset.
Yeah, the phone was facing the other way. And that goes back up there.
Well, are you just hanging out with Ross?
It's, all good! Okay bye-bye Mon! She's-she's gonna kill me.
We should start with the big stuff. Y'know? That'll be the easiest. Uh, let's start with the couch. I got it.
Yeah that-that, doesn't look right.
Check it out! Almost 3 hours without droppin' it!
Hey Rach!
Hey.
Oh, wow! Congratulations, that's quite a waste of time.
Rach?
Ok, ok, here is to my sister, the newly-appointed head lunch chef--
Thanks.
No, you keep the pack. I'm all cried out today.
Who is also in charge of purchasing.
Newly appointed head lunch chef who is also in charge of purchasing--
Well, he said there's definitely nothing to worry about, it's totally benign.
Well?!
Okay, how'd it go at the doctor's?
Well what is it?!
He couldn't even tell me! He said it was just some sort of skin... abnormality. And the worst thing is he-he-he said, he said, without being able to identify it, he was reluctant to remove it.
Yeah, definitely, I'm sure you'll feel totally different when it's our baby.
It's alright, it's no big deal.
Really?
What?
What?
All right, that's it! Come-you-no! You are in big trouble young man!
Oh I...
What did we just finish talking about Ben?!
No! Wait! Come on!
Wait! No! Ben, come here! I am not kidding!
Look at you two, bonding, making us late for the airport so...
Oh, there's tonnes of terrific stuff-I'll go with you!
Ahh!
Are you all right?
Oh, he's fine. He's fine. It's just that us getting along is difficult for him, because he doesn't like me.
I have no idea. I mean... But-but I assure you I will figure it out.
Well look, I'm just trying to focus on the "I get to see my wife," part, all right? And not the part that makes me do this.
Wow, so you guys are, you're never gonna be in the same room together? How is that even gonna work?
Doesn't seem like it's going to work, I mean...
Hi, guys!
Well, he's finally alseep. About that ah, bump on his head?
What? What are you, what are you talking about?
They have a kid together, y'know. They're like, they're like a family, and if, I don't know, there's chance they could make that work, I know I wouldn't want to be the guy who stood in the way of that. Are you okay? Do you wanna ah, come poke a nude guy?
Are you, are you, are you sure it's ah, a new bump? I mean, no offense, I've always thought of Ben as a fairly bumpy headed child.
It's okay if he bumps his head, kids bump their heads all the time, y'know, it was your first time babysitting, I figured you did the best you could.
I'm sorry you lost your money, but I won it fair and square.
Chandler, what kind of an idiot do you take me for?
It's not a real game! I made it up!
At a fake game!!
Now, if you wanna try to make some of it back, I'd be glad to play you for it. But I should warn you, I am very good at Cups.
Joey, I did not break this! Okay? That has been broken for a while.
Joey, I saw you push him!
You pushed him!
All right. Chandler, do you remember how I told you about our fridge?
Uh-huh.
Yeah, what're you guys doin' here, aren't you supposed to be Christmas shopping?
So whaddya got there Monica?
Just some stuff for the party.
You guys haven't gotten your presents yet? Tomorrow's Christmas Eve, what're ya gonna do?
Don't you have to be Claymation to say stuff like that?
Let me hold him for a sec. There. Huh? There we are.
Hi, it's me. Listen, Bob. I'm probably way out of line here. I mean, It has been 3 years, and you're probably seeing someone else now, but if we could just have one night together, just for old time's sake, one hot, steamy, wild night...
Who da wenny-Benny boy? You the Wenny-wenny-Benny-Benny boy, yes. Don't cry. Don't cry. Why is he still crying?
Maye it's me.
Don't be silly. Ben loves you. He's just being Mr. Crankypants.
We were drunk! I would've married uh, Joey with that amount of alcohol!
This is crazy! I mean, yes-yes Rachel is my good friend and I-I have loved her in the past, but now, she is just my wife! Phoebe, will you-will you help me out here?
Well, I thought you loved her when you-when you married her.
Hey! You could do a lot worse than Joey Tribbiani!!
Look, I'm sorry, but you guys are wrong. I just don't want to be divorced three times.
That's the day you're gonna die? See-darnit, I've got shuffleboard that day.
Aww, Pheeb, come on isn't there any relative that would have the recipe? What about, what about your sister?
Oh no-no, no, I made a promise to myself that the next time I would talk to Ursula would be over my dead body. And that's not happening 'til October 15th, 2032.
That's what you think.
Well, I mean what about friends of your grandmother's? Wouldn't they have the recipe?
Oh come on! Here we go! Stand by for mission countdown!
I'm, I'm sorry you didn't get to go to Spacecamp, and I'm hoping that maybe somehow, this may make up for it. Presenting Sarah Tuttle's Private Very Special Spacecamp!!
Really Mr. Geller, you don't have to do this.
Ten, ten.., nine, nine, nine...., eight, eight, eight... Okay, Blast off!
I'm an alien. I'm an alien.
Okay, forward. Forward-Stop! Okay, back-Stop! Okay, forward-Stop! Stop! Stop!
Okay.
Surprise!!!
Ross, just forget about it. This guy's got you totally wedged in.
Is this yours?
Here we come, walkin' down thethis doesn't smell like Mom's.
Ok, Monica, only dogs can hear you now, so, look, the door's open. Here we go.
Well, the turkey's burnt. Potatoes are ruined, potatoes are ruined, potatoes are ruined.
No, it doesn't, does it? But you wanted lumps, Ross? Well, here you go, buddy, ya got one.
Oh, god, this is great! The plane is gone, so it looks like I'm stuck here with you guys.
717? Where's 717? Hey, you've have more of these for Susan right?
....right? Right? I mean it's pretty unbelievable y'know, I mean they just took off, took off without even looking back. Y'know I don't, I don't need them, huh, I've got you guys now as friends, you and Susan.
Ah, Susan will be so pleased.
No. But it's okay, I'll just put out pickles or something.
Ross, thank God.
C'mon, you're going out with the guy! There's gotta be something wrong with him!

There's nothing to tell! He's just some guy I work with!
All right Joey, be nice. So does he have a hump? A hump and a hairpiece?
Wait, does he eat chalk?
Paolo, I-I just want to tell you and I think I speak for everyone when I say...
Paolo, I really hate you for what you did to Rachel, but I still have five of these, so heat it at 375 until the cheese bubbles.
Grazie.
Oh, just look at her...
Oh you guys, I-I really think just one of us should go out there so she's not overwhelmed...
Pheebs, we had the most incredible night! Okay, so, we're in the car...
John Glenn is here?!
No, Joey!
Wait! Hold on! Hi!
Hi!
Look, I don't know what you're talking about, I am not a crazy, jealous person.
Excuse me?
Yeah, she turned you into this-this-this untrusting, crazy, jealous, sycophant. All right, so I don't know what sycophant means, but the rest is right.
Huh.
What?
When Monica was a little girl, I remember that--Ooh!! Ow! Very good!
Yes! Your honor?
We're now in the ceremony, Monica is about to say, "I do" when her drunk uncle starts yelling. What do you do? Go!
Oh!
Yes! Excellent! Perfect score!
I uh, went to a bar. And then I just uh, just walked around for a while.
Ohh, out, oh God, I don't know why we didn't think to check there!
What were you doing?
You walked around all night in the city by yourself?
He hooked up! He hooked up with someone.
No, it's really not that bad. I mean, I-I for one, feel perfectly safe.
Yeah, try sticking it in the freezer for 20 minutes. I'm tellin' ya!
I can't believe you really walk alone here! I mean, you hear such stories about New York.
Help! Help!! Help! Help!!
No, no, no Ross! Ross, these are friends of mine from home. Liam, Devon, this is Ross.
Okay, umm. Did you ever see, um, Return Of The Jedi?
What?
...if you tell me, I might do it.
Yeah.
Do you remember the scene with, um, Jabba the Hut? Well Jabba had as, as his prisoner, um, Princess Leia.
We are never gonna find him! He's one guy in a huge city!
Yes you are!
All right.
Oh my God! Is that him?
That is an old, Chinese woman!
Oh, Pheebs, I'm sorry, Ive got to go. Ive got Lamaze class.
Um, Pheebs, so, you guys just dont get along?
Its mostly just dumb sister stuff, you know, I mean, like, everyone always thought of her as the pretty one, you know... Oh, oh, she was the first one to start walking, even though I did it... later that same day. But, to my parents, by then it was like "yeah, right, well what else is new?"
Oh, and Ive got Earth Science, but I'll catch you in Gym.
So, is this just gonna be you and Carol?
Okay, Mon, I really don't think this is the... Okay, you're dialing, you are dialing.
Monica, how are you gonna do that?
I know the code to his answering machine.
"Hi, this is Richard. Please, leave a message at the tone."
"You have two new messages."
Marcel? Marcel? Okay, where is he? Where is he? Marcel? Marcel?
Then what's with all the bananas?
Potassium.
Marcel! What've you done to him?
That's my monkey. That's Patti, Patti the monkey.
To London! Come to London. Please? It'll mean so much to me.
So-so come! Why don't you come?
What?!
Yeah, well, I gotta work, I'm sorry.
Why-why can't you take a couple of days off?
No that's not what I want. Uh, I'm glad you guys were bonding but I...
I will be! Listen, I don't want you teaching my son that stuff anymore. Okay?
Fine. Fine, but I'll have you know that once I taught him that stuff he called me Fun Aunt Rachel. And I loved being Fun Aunt Rachel but I'll go back to being Boring and Uncomfortable Aunt Rachel if that's what you want!
Look he doesn't have any brothers or sisters, somebody's gonna have to teach him this stuff! And I haven't taught him anything that a normal 6-year-old doesn't know anyway!
Crap!!
No! Okay! Okay! Okay, look, can I, can I just-just talk to you for a second?
Nobody! We put them in here!
You want some?!
Yeah, sure.
Uh, so this play umm, what do you think? It's-it's gotten great reviews! Y'know the uh...
OH MY GOD!! I didn't really believe it until you just said it!!
Uh-huh, Carol, so were we. All right, just-just imagine for a moment, Susan meets someone and-and they really hit it off. Y'know? Say-say they're coming back from the theatre, and they-they stop at a pub for a couple of drinks, they're laughing, y'know, someone innocently touches someone else... There's electricity, it's new. It's exciting. Are you telling me there isn't even the slightest possibility of something happening?
Maybe.
...and even though none of the other kids believed me, I swear to God, that duck pushed me!
Wow! This place is fabulous!
Don't be silly. Ben loves you. He's just being Mr. Crankypants.
Let me hold him for a sec. There. Huh? There we are.
Maye it's me.
You know, I once dated a Miss Crankypants. Lovely girl, kinda moody.
There we go. All better.
Monica, you're so lucky! He's like the most popular guy in school!!
The guy who took Rachel to the prom? Why is he calling you?
'Cause I ran into him at the bank, he is still soo cute.
I know!! Chip? Hi! It's Monica. 'Kay. 'Kay. Okay. Okay, good-bye. Oh my God, we just had the best conversation!!
I was just leaving.
I was kinda, supposed to be on TV tonight for The Discovery Channel.
Okay, now when you come back I hope you remember that, that chick is not a toy!
What thing? What is this thing?
Oh my God!
Yeah.
You're right. Yours is worse. You are the king of bad Thanksgivings.
Now Chandler dear, just because your father and I are getting a divorce it doesn't mean we don't love you. It just means he would rather sleep with the house-boy than me.
More turkey Mr. Chandler?
I don't know about that. I've got one that's worse.
Really? Worse than, "More turkey Mr. Chandler?"
All righty roo. What a great moment to say that for the first time.
No, um, see 'cause that, that is, that is the staging area. If you go in there, it'll ruin the whole illusion of the party. Yeah, I think you take your scotch back in there and I will get your cigarettes for you sir.
Get my glasses too.
Ok, the first person's most embarassing memory is, 'Monica, your party sucks.' Very funny.
Oh no, ooh, ooh, did somebody forget to use a coaster?
How do you know? I mean we thought Carol was straight before I married her!
No, but I'm gonna!
Hi! Hi! You're crazy! Okay? This is Emily. Emily is straight.
Yeah, I definitely. I don't like the name Ross.
What a weird way to kick me when I'm down.
No, you guys, I mean my keyboards are all the way up in-No, yeah, okay.
Come on, play that funky music white boy.
Yeah!
Okay, guys.
All right! Bring it on, you...
No, look, hey, it's my birthday, and the important thing is that we all be together.
Hootie and the--oh my. I, I can catch them on the radio.
No, now I feel bad. You wanna go to the concert.
All of us.
Together.
I've never walked down the aisle knowing it can't end in divorce.
Huh. This is nice.
What?
Oh I wish you're grandmother had lived to see this.
She's right there.
I.....got.....dressed. Really, really quickly. Okay, okay. There we go, there we go.
Yeah, see Mon, listen, listen. When Carol and I broke up, I went through the same thing. And you know what I did?
Huh?
You know what, okay, fine. Don't get up, you just sit right there. I just hope, you don't mind, you know, my hand right here. Op, not touching, can't get mad! Not touching can't get mad! Not touching can't get mad!
Ah! Oh my God! You r-r-rotten boys!
So Joey umm, you look familiar. Are uh, are you on TV or something?
Yeah. So...
Sure! I would love to wait with you guys! Thanks!
Well Joey doesn't like to talk about it but, he's one of the stars of Days Of Our Lives.
That's right! That's right, don't you play a woman?
Oh, nothin' much. Just trying to figure out what I'm gonna do for dinner.
Hey! What's up?
Ross!
Huh.
Hey-Ooh! What's-what's that, dinner stuff? You making dinner?
I will, I will. See, I'm waiting for the right moment. What? What, now?
I'm taking my time, alright? I'm laying the groundwork. Yeah. I mean, every day I get just a little bit closer to...
Priesthood! Look Ross, I'm telling you, she has no idea what you're thinking. If you don't ask her out soon you're going to end up stuck in the zone forever.
Yeeeeaaaahhh! What's messing you up? The wine? The candles? The moonlight? You've just got to go up to her and say, 'Rachel, I think that...'
Shhhh!
Hey, you gotta get Mom on the phone. Call Mom! Call Mom!
Oh my.
Monica's gonna marry a millionaire!!!
Hello.
And that's Pete's Mom.
Are you sure? Hold on. I'm sorry you guys, that was a coffee and a....
What?!
The man is showing brain.
Coffee.
Okay.
What? That's great. That is great. What did we just finish talking about Ben?!
What?
I can't let him go out that way, he's got a meeting. You've got something here on your back.
Oh I...
What did we just finish talking about Ben?!
Do you remember the Ludwins? The big one had a thing for you, didn't she?
Mmmm!
I- I think they're great! I, I really do.
They all had a thing for him.
Aw, Mom...
Everybody put their balloons down!!! Now this is a nice suit!!
You put your balloons down!!
You put your balloons down!!
Our next item is the romantic trip to Paris. It goes to Emil Alexander high a high bid of 2,300.
Ugh! So close!
No suds? Excuse me, hold on a second. That's my friend's machine.
So?
Well, you know, no suds, no save.
Hey, hey, hey, her stuff wasn't in it.
Hey, hey, hey, that's not the rule and you know it.
Well hello! She's cute! Should we uh, go try to talk to her?
What are peanut butter fingers?!
Oh yeah...
Sure! That's one of the great things about being engaged. I'm not nervous talking to pretty girls anymore.
Could you guys help me?
No see now, now I can't because uh, I'm feeling too self conscious.
OK, my hands were no where near your butt.
I know, I know, I know, I know. I was just thinking about when they were there the last time, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. OK, OK, look, woah, I promise, I'm good, I'm not gonna laugh anymore. OK put your hands back there.
Just one cheek.
Nuh, uh, the moment's gone.
I'll be fine, alright? Really, everyone. I hope she'll be very happy.
No, no don't! Stop cleansing my aura! No, just leave my aura alone, okay?
Fine! Be murky!
No you don't.
No I don't, to hell with her, she left me!
I dunno, it's weird. I mean, I know she's gone, but I just don't feel, uh...
Oh, that sucks!
You guys okay?
Maybe that's 'cause she's not really gone.
Nono, she's gone.
Look, I didn't think there was a relationship to jeopardise. I thought we were broken up.
Listen. Oh hey, hey, the important thing was that she meant, she meant nothing to me!
And yet she was worth jeopardising our relationship!!
We were on a break!
That, for all I knew would, could last forever. That to me is a break-up.
Yeah, I was but uh, she was a little busy with a water balloon fight.
Oh you knew that. Good!
I thought you were going out with Elizabeth.
Oh Ross, sometimes grown-ups have commitments they just can't get out of!
Y'know, maybe she is too young for me. Y'know, when I was over there and she was running around with her friends, I felt like I was a baby-sitter. I finally started to see what you guys were talking about. I don't know what to do.
Hootie and the--oh my. I, I can catch them on the radio.
G-gift? The thing's not the gift?
No, the thing was, we were gonna go see Hootie and the Blowfish.
No, now I feel bad. You wanna go to the concert.
No, look, hey, it's my birthday, and the important thing is that we all be together.
Can you believe this? We're gonna be on the platform for the Millennium moment!
What's the matter with you? Get out of here!
Yeah, take a hike wetpants!
I know! Hey, you haven't been practising the routine, have you?
No!
You're right, you're right, it is...So you gonna invite us all to the big opening?
Oh no, it's terrific, it's... it's... y'know, you deserve this, after all your years of struggling, you've finally been able to crack your way into showbusiness.
Okay, okay, fine! Make jokes, I don't care! This is a big break for me!
Alright, alright, alright...
Here. I need to borrow some moisturizer.
Sometimes I wonder if I did the right thing, ya know, giving him away.
I can see that, 'cause they both have those big brown eyes and, ya know, the little pouty chin.
And the fact that they're both monkeys.
Oh, Ross, you had to, I mean, he was humping everything in sight. I mean, I have a Malibu Barbi that will no longer be wearing white to her wedding.
Remember when sometimes he'd borrow your hat, and, and when you got it back there'd be little monkey raisins in it.
Now that's a little spoiled. He was supposed to type "little", the idiot.
Ok, just, just remember how crazy I am about you, ok?
Kind of ditzy? Too into her looks? Spoiled?
Just a waitress?
No, that, that was, I mean, as opposed to uh, the uh, ok. Is this over yet Rach?
Question. Why do we always have to have parties where you poach things?
Ohhh.
What?
You wanna be in charge of the food committee?
Question two. Why do we always have to have parties with committees?
What? Of course I did! You uh, you sat next to Sleepy Sleeperson.
I know!
Oh please! It was such a big class! You never even noticed me!
Who?
Oh uh, I had trouble remembering everyone's name, so I-I kinda came up with nicknames. Like the guy on the other side of you was Smelly von Brownshirt.
No! No! Wh... What are you doing?!! GET OFF MY SISTER!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Well actually, Ross doesn't.
Yes, and we'd appreciate it if no one told him yet.
Y'know, you're friend's getting married, it's gotta change things.
You really think it would be that different?
So he's calling from Rome. I could do that. Just gotta go to Rome.
Hello? Hello? Oh! Rachel, it's Paolo calling from Rome.
Oh my God! Calling from Rome! Bon giorno, caro mio.
Monica, your dad just beeped in, but can you make it quick? Talking to Rome. I'm talking to Rome.
Hey dad, what's up? Oh God. Ross, it's Nana.
Maybe it's uh Sergeant Sagittarius coming back to flirt some more!
What?! What does he want?! I wasn't doing anything!
Well maybe he saw your hand slip briefly from the ten and two o'clock position.
It's a different guy!
Good evening officer.
What? So what are you going to do? I mean how, how are you going to tell Chandler?
No, no he's not.
You guys, Joey just saw Janice kissing her ex-husband.
Well, I was thinking about that and I, I think the best way would be, to not.
Joey, you can't keep this to yourself, if you know about this, you have to tell him.
I don't want to be single, okay? I just... I just- I just wanna be married again!
Alright Ross, look. You're feeling a lot of pain right now. You're angry. You're hurting. Can I tell you what the answer is?
Strip joint! C'mon, you're single! Have some hormones!
And I just want a million dollars!
Rachel?!
Yeah? I can use that, trick hip, no cup, okay! Okay!
All right, bad ankle, got it!
And that big bloke with the beard, he has got a trick hip. Yeah. And uh, and David over there, I heard he doesn't wear a cup.
And uh, Liam, Liam's got bad knees. You hit him right and he'll go down like a lamp.
But-but, Liam's on my team.
I don't know. I mean, all right, I guess you can say she's a little spoiled sometimes.
No, Amish boy.
Ok, let's start with the cons, 'cause they're more fun. All right, Rachel first.
You could say that.
And I guess, you know, sometimes, she's a little ditzy, you know. And I've seen her be a little too into her looks. Oh, and Julie and I, we have a lot in common 'cause we're both paleontologists, but Rachel's just a waitress.
Uh-ha, what about someone who looks like Rachel? I will think about the therapy.
Ooh! There's no way to do this without her? 'Cause I kinda all ready told her uh, it was, it was already taken care of.
Of course you did. Look Ross, you can't get an annulment unless you and Rachel are both there.
Hey!
Hey. So um, I was thinking that maybe we should start dividing up our stuff.
Anyway.. um.. So, you- uh- you nervous about Barry tomorrow?
D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help?
Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks!
Oh.. a little..
Mm-hmm..
I can't, I can't even believe her! No, y'know what, I am, I am gonna go!
I could, yeah, I can do that.
Yeah.
Good!
I know, why not?
Look, this is my home and I want to be able to come and go whenever I want!
And they knew about it?
Okay, well Ross, what is this really about?
Okay, I will find someplace else to do the rest of my appointments. I just don't know what the big deal is!
The big deal is I don't want naked, greasy strangers in my apartment when I want to kick back with a puzzle-beer! Cold beer.
I'm telling you, she said she's looking for a relationship with someone exactly like me.
I agree. I'm, like, in disbelief.
I mean, don't you think if things were gonna happen with Rachel, they would've happened already?
She really said that?
Well, I added the 'exactly like me' part... But she said she's looking for someone, and someone is gonna be there tonight.
Okay, so, do you make the pizzas in one of those uh, wood-burning ovens?
Hey! Oh, we-we can't keep eating like this.
It's uh, $12.50.
No actually umm, I think that they're umm, gas.
Gas? Wow! Intense.
No! The reason I'm asking is that... I sorta had one last night.
Hey Joe did... Did you ever have a threesome?
Well uh, look Ross I uh, I think Carol's great and I'm sure you're a very attractive man, but I....
You?
Yeah!
I go back there with lawn ornaments, he's going to laugh in my face.
Look, face it, my father is not going to pay for the build-in barbecue and believe me you can kiss you gazebo goodbye. Now I might be able to get you the new lawn.
Ahh, then you have to give us the lawn ornaments.
This is ridiculous. I mean we had an agreement. Will you say something, Steven?! Please!!!
Don't take that tone with me. All-all right you can.
OK. OK, this is a picture frame from Ben to my parents, huh.
Um, just some presents.
C'mon show us what you bought. . . You know you want to.
Cute.
I got some, uh, hers and hers towels for Susan and Carol. And, uh, I got this blouse for mom.
Hey, 30 is not that old! Do you know how old the Earth is?
Why God?!! Why?!! We had a deal!! Let the others grow old! Not me!!
Y'know, I'm still 29 in Guam.
Late thirties? Oh come on you guys! Is it just me? Am I overreacting to this?
No Rach, it's not just you. My thirtieth birthday certainly wasn't that much fun.
Thanks guys! I really appreciate this, y'know, but you don't have to rub my butt.
That's cool.
But, we'll stay here with you.
We have to leave for New York in an hour.
I know, I've been looking at those doors, they look pretty sound proof, don't you think?
Look, I don't think so Pheebs. All right, I'll do it. But just because you're a friend.
What?! No!
Well okay but I have two tickets to the ballroom dance finals.
Hi Ginger.
All right! I want my key back!
I will be! Listen, I don't want you teaching my son that stuff anymore. Okay?
Uh, y'know what? I'll tell you who it hurts! It hurts the kid who has all his clothes stolen in gym class so he has to go to the principal's office wearing nothing but a catcher's mitt!
That was you?! We heard about you in Junior High! Did you really just shake your fist in the air and shout, "I will be revenged?!"
Fine. Fine, but I'll have you know that once I taught him that stuff he called me Fun Aunt Rachel. And I loved being Fun Aunt Rachel but I'll go back to being Boring and Uncomfortable Aunt Rachel if that's what you want!
No that's not what I want. Uh, I'm glad you guys were bonding but I...
Can I ask you something? Have you ever had a guy have a crush on you?
No, a guy would be saying, "I'm never gonna get to sleep with anyone else." Oh my God! I'm never gonna get to sleep with anyone else! I've been so busy planning the wedding that I forgot about all the things that I'd be giving up! I mean, I...I'm never gonna have a first kiss again.
You'll have a last kiss.
Is that why you wanted to tie my tie?
There's this kid in my class who said he's in love with me.
You have no idea what a nightmare this has been. This is so hard.
It's awful I know, I mean, I feel terrible but I have to do this if I want my marriage to work. And I do, I have to make this marriage work. I have too. But the good thing is we can still see each other until she gets here.
Ohh! Lucky me! Oh my God! That is good news, Ross! I think that's the best news I've heard since Le Poo died!
Oh yeah, really? Is it Ross? Yeah? Okay, well let me make this a just a little bit easier for you.
What are you doing?
You go get 'em. What did I do to you? Did I hurt you in some way?
High collar and baggy pants say I'm a pro.
Yeah! Right! Okay, I'll see you guys later. Woo hoo!
What?
'Why don't you call him?!' Well, thank you very much! Y'know now he is going to prep her, y'know prep her, as in what you do when you surgically remove the boyfriend!
Oh so-so you weren't trying to entice me just now with your-your nakedness?
The physical act of love.
What?! Are you crazy?
Oh God, you saw me?! Oh!
You weren't trying to entice me with your nakedness.
Well I guess you can start by drivin a cab on Another World.
What, woah, woah, $3500 at porcelain safari?
My animals. Hey the guy said they suited me, he spoke with an accent, I was all confused. I don't know what I'm gonna do.
What?
That audition.
Okay, come on! All right, I gotta go! So good luck at the party. Okay?
Yep?
Sure, I'll just sit next to the trans-sexual from purchasing.
Oh wait, Ross, would you just stay and help me get dressed?
Sure, okay.
No-no-no, a bunch of out of control jackets take over an island.
Y'know what, 100 million people went to see a movie about what I do, I wonder how many people would go see a movie called, Jurassic Parka.
Oh, that is so...
Y'know if what I do is so lame, then why did you insist on coming with me this morning? Huh? Was it so I just wouldn't go with Mark?
No. I... I wanted to be with you. I don't know, I feel like lately, I feel like you're slipping away from me, y'know. With this new job, and all these new people, and you've got this whole other life going on. I-I-I know it's dumb, but I hate that I'm not a part of it.
Sure! Oh, and Joey's got the mashed potatoes if you want to exchange them.
Okay, okay, you got it!
Ross, can you pass me the yams?
Would you stop?! What is the matter with you?!
Oh-ho-ho, we've got company.
Yeah-oh! Hey listen umm, Emily found this wedding dress in London...
Oh. Thanks. Uh, has anyone seen Rach?
Ugh, she's upstairs not doing the dishes! And I tell ya something! I'm not doing them this time! I don't care if those dishes sit in the sink until they're all covered with-I'll do them when I get home!
Already?!
Yeah, but it didn't fit. Well, luckily there's a store here that has one left in her size, but I'm the groom, I'm not supposed to see the dress...
I told mom and dad last night, they seemed to take it pretty well.
No!! Okay?! Why does everyone keep fixating on that? She didn't know, how should I know?
Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian... Did I say that out loud?
Oh really, so that hysterical phone call I got from a woman at sobbing 3:00 A.M., "I'll never have grandchildren, I'll never have grandchildren." was what? A wrong number?
Sorry.
No! Oh, no-no-no. Hey, you weren't bad, you've been very good, Ben.
Well, how about this year, instead of Santa, we have fun celebrating Hanukkah?
No Santa? Was I bad?
Santa's mad at me.
No, hey-hey, come on, Ben, Santa is not mad at you, okay? Hey, you're-you're his favorite little guy!
Well then a small one!! Listen, let's, we kinda have to get going!
Umm, oh, hey, I don't know. How about a big one?
But my apartment is so...
Wait! Where's my shoes?
You, you sure you need shoes? Okay.
She's not here yet. She's not here. She's having my baby and she's not here.
Here we go, here we go.
Rossy, Rossy.
I'm sure everything's fine. Has her water broke yet?
I don't know, but when I spoke to her, she said she had already passed the mucus plug.
I'm agreeing with you. Did you, listen, did you happen to tell Phoebe yet?
Very bad.
Very, very bad.
No.
Okay, Jasmine, please, please don't. I love my girlfriend very much, and I want more than anything to just work it out with her. Okay?
It was...This disagreement over... My god. You...you look beautiful.
Sorry old boy, sorry. Sorry. Sorry. I could kill you with my thumb, you know.
What was all that about?
Ohh... Oh! You were not meant to see me before the wedding. It's bad luck.
You know what, I think we've had all the bad luck we're going to have.
Yeah, y'know what? I'll take it myself, thank you! All right Rach, let's go!
Oh, sure. Whoa-whoa, what's this? The delivery charge is almost as much as the couch!
Wait! No, that's ridiculous. Come on, he lives three blocks away!
Yeah! Are you kiddin'?
Oh, come on it's only three blocks! And-and, it's not very heavy, try it! Come on! Come on!
That's all right, we-we don't need you. In fact, hey I'm over it already.
It makes him miss the bowl, but whatever.
We're so sorry.
Yeah, and y'know what? I don't give a tiny rat's ass.
Yeah, we're gonna go.
Hey Pheebs, what-what was the deal with you and Chandler blowing us off before?
Good. Bye!
Okay! You take care!
Yeah! That was so weird, huh?
Phoebe, why'd you do it?
Listen to me! When my time comes, I wanna be buried at sea.
I was just thinking. When my time comes-
Dad!
You what?
I wanna be buried at sea, it looks like fun.
Absolutely. So, twins... hah! Thats like two births. Ouch.
A little.
But were fine.
And to you too, Helen.
Nina Bookbinder is here to see you.
Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now.
Ooh! I found it!
W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-...
Kinda puts that whole pillow thing in perspective, huh, Mon?
Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing?
You weren't there! Okay, maybe this is something that I-I'm supposed to seize! Y'know?
Okay, look, yesterday I would've even considered calling her back, but my ex-wife calls on the same day I have a near death experience. I mean, that-that has got to mean something!
Ugh, Ross! That was not a near death experience! That was barely an experience!
Okay, y'know what? Maybe, this is not about seizing stuff. Maybe this is about escaping stuff.
Huh.
Hey, Joey. Are men ever nice to strange women for no reason?
Well, I'm just saying, I mean why else would he just, y'know, swoop in out of nowhere for no reason.
To be nice.
No, only for sex.
Thank you. So did you ah, did you tell Mark Something about me?
Sweetie, you gotta relax. Everything's gonna be great, okay? Come on. Come on.
No! No! That's-that's time-out!
Sorry.
Chicken Kiev?
Um-hmm! Doesn't that sound delicious at the last minute?
Great! Because people kept showing up, I think it's like uh-a thing!
Let me ask you something, at your school was there a like uh a place on campus where students went to uh, fool around.
Yeah, there was. It was-there the corner of the library where-where all these dusty books that nobody ever read-Yes, there was.
Now hold on a second, fifth floor against that back wall?
Oh for cryin' out loud!
Well, everyone's gotta kiss someone. You can't kiss Ross you got the history.
Rach! Rach! Listen, I'm gonna kiss you at midnight.
What?!
So?
So? Who would you rather have kiss you, me or Chandler?
Correct. Chandler was how old when he first touched a girl's breast?
30 seconds on the clock. 5 questions wins the game. The lightning round begins...now! What is Joey's favorite food?
Sandwiches!
14?
No, 19.
Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow.
What does she mean by 'involved'?
I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done.
So what are you gonna do?
I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father.
I was their first born! They thought she was barren! It's not my fault.
Come on, you know they love you.
As much as they love you?
Hey.
Hey.
Ok. Wow, you guys sure have a lot of books about bein' a lesbian.
Kinda like a big face without skin.
Yes, I'm familiar with the concept. We can just look for it.
Well, you know, you have to take a course. Otherwise, they don't let you do it.
Hey, hey, Yertle the Turtle. A classic.
Oh, that's not true! I've got her lots of stuff she never took back.
Yeah, well maybe Phoebe will switch with me.
Oh no-no-no, you don't want to do that, then you're gonna get stuck with Rachel and she exchanges every gift she ever gets.
Like?
Like uh, that gold necklace I got her last year.
OK, you guys, ya know, I think we've seen enough, let's turn it off.
OK. Hold my board.
Atta boy.
No, no, no.
OK, fine, well I'm not gonna watch, alright.
No. No. You-you can't help. I mean, I kinda have to do this without your help.
Just stuff. Y'know kinda what Emily wants.
Well, why don't you talk to me about it, maybe I can help.
Well, I-I know you can do that too. I'm just, I'm just saying if you need somebody to talk to... Hi!
Thanks.
So I asked Emily if she would come to New York, and she said yes.
Oh that is so great! That's...
As long as you don't see Rachel anymore.
Yes!
Ooh-ohh!
Blah blah blah, blah blah blah... blah blaaaaaah....
Perfection?

Wha-What did he say that was so funny?
I have absolutely no idea.
Look, I'm sorry, but you guys are wrong. I just don't want to be divorced three times.
We were drunk! I would've married uh, Joey with that amount of alcohol!
Hey! You could do a lot worse than Joey Tribbiani!!
Yes, and now he's using this three divorces reason because he wants to stay married to her because he loves her. I must say, "Well done!" Bravo Meg.
Okay! Fine! Fine! If-if this is what you think, forget about the whole three divorce thing! Okay, I-I'll go to my lawyer's office right now and get this marriage annulled! Okay?! Because she means nothing to me! Noth--Nothing!!
I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father.
Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow.
So what are you gonna do?
.....Well, this is still ruined, right?
Oh, Martha Ludwin's daughter is gonna call you. Mmm! What's that curry taste?
No, no, I was turnin' the knob and, and. . . here it is.
Fine, OK! Heat, heat, heat, and I'm the obsessive one. OK, this way is on, so this is. . . off.
Did you just break the radiator?
Well put it back.
It uhh, it won't go back.
Y'know what? I'm gonna go out on a limb and say no divorces in '99!
Happy New Year, Joey!
So did that do anything for ya?
But your divorce isn't even final yet.
Just the one divorce in '99! Y'know what, I am gonna be happy this year. I am gonna make myself happy.
No, come on, he doesnt know this stuff. If he knew how you felt.
Hon, you gotta talk to Joey.
Yeah. Okay.
But hes falling in love with her.
Oh please, theyve been going out a week. They havent even slept together yet, I mean, thats not serious.
That's it? That's all you wrote? You're the worst writer in the whole world.
Hey, uh, why don't you read it to her?
Alright. "It was summer, and it was hot. Rachel was there. A lonely gray couch. 'Oh, look,' cried Ned, and then the kingdom was his forever. The end."
All right, you know what? This isn't funny anymore. There's something about me on that piece of paper and I want to see it.
No, you don't.
'Pwease, Aunt Monica, pwease?' Oh, unclench. You're not even gonna be there.
That's right, you're gonna spend tomorrow at Aunt Rachel's, aren't you.
Oh, hang on, hang on. Does Aunt Monica get a say in this?
I can't believe we are even having this discussion.
I agree. I'm, like, in disbelief.
Oh, that's right! He called to ask out Monica! That-that's gotta be embarrassing!
Oh, I'm sure.
Chip! Hi, it's Rachel. Rachel Green. Yeah, umm, you left me a message. Yes you did, my roommate wrote it down. Monica Geller. Ohh.
...DUMB, DRUNKEN, BITCH!!! Thank you, thanks.
Hey, here's a question; where did you guys get the finest oak East of the Mississippi?
Hey, could you do me a favour? Could you just grab me a bottle of water?
Did you see me? I was pretty good, huh? That is one fun game!
Right.
Okay.
Thanks. I-I think I'm dying. I really do.
No, no, no just do it. Go in there and pick something out so we can go.
Yeah, pants, what, what an idea. Or better yet, um, how 'bout you go without any pants. Look, I don't know what you're trying to do to me, but just get your butt in there and pick out any shoes that fit your feet, okay. No, no I don't care if they match. I don't care if they make your ankles or your knees or your earlobes look fat. Okay.
But I...
All right.
Thank you!
Okay, so I'm gonna be the only one standing there alone when the ball drops?
Sorry. Paolo's catching an earlier flight.
Yeah, and I met this really hot single mom at the store. What's an elf to do?
Oh, c'mon. We'll have, we'll have a big party, and no-one'll know who's with who.
Hey, y'know, this is so not what I needed right now.
That's right, I.. 'cause I didn't expect you were gonna invite them to the apartment!
Marcel is an illegal exotic animal. I'm not allowed to have him in the city. If they find him, they'll take him away from me.
O-okay, now see, you never ever ever told us that...
Hi, thanks for coming.
Somebody called about a monkey?
Ok, ok look, see, the thing is we're, we're not gonna fight you guys.
You had to ask.
Yeah.
Well then here's the deal, you won't have to so long as never ever show your faces in this coffee house ever again.
I think you played the Gunther card too soon.
Yeah, anything goes, except ah, eye gouging and fish hooking.
Yeah, it's two guys in a ring, and the rules are "There are no rules."
So you can like, bite, and pull people's hair and stuff?
What's fish hooking?
Huh, what's fish hooking... Thanks man, that would have been really hard to describe. What is that taste?
No, you, ya know there's no need to make it u. . . how?
Listen can you guys uh, speak up, it's harder for us to hear you when you lower your voice.
OK, listen, I'm sorry about last night and I really want to make it up to you.
Well, I was thinking maybe a um, a romantic dinner with um, candles and wine and then uh, maybe going back to my place for um, dessert.
Humm, that sounds, I don't, perfect.
Ahh, I-I did leave the gel on a little longer then it said to.
Ross they're really, really, really white.
Yeah, what was wrong with your old...human teeth.
How much longer?
A-A day.
No! Okay, you mean, you're not gonna talk to her, you're not gonna tell her how you feel?
We're rehearsing a Greek play.
That's very funny. We done now?
That would be no. Look, just because you played tonsil tennis with my mom doesn't mean you know her. Alright? Trust me, you can't talk to her.
Okay, 'you' can't, or you can't? Okay, that's my finger. That's, that's my knee. Still doing the play. Aaah!
Look, I'm not trying to get out of anything, okay. I thought our relationship was dead!
That, for all I knew would, could last forever. That to me is a break-up.
You think you're gonna get out of this on a technicality?
Well, you sure had a hell of a time at the wake!
Y'know what, I don't think we should listen to this anymore.
Joey, I figured you'd understand. I mean, I-I've known him a lot longer.
I sort've already asked Chandler.
What?! He got to do it at your first wedding!
Come on Ross! Look, I-I don't have any brothers; I'll never get to be a best man!
You can be the best man when I get married.
Because you're a kook! Instead you wait until they send you a notice.
Alright, you madcap gal. Try to imagine this. The phone bill arrives, but you don't pay it right away.
Why not?
I could do that.
Okay, uh, you let me go grocery shopping, and I buy laundry detergent, but it's not the one with the easy-pour spout.
I'll be right there. Hello! Hello! Hey. Uhh, Emily, this is Carol and Susan.
Uhh, believe me when he's older, he'll understand.
Ross!
Hey, it's so nice to finally meet you!
Me too!
Well, uh, uh, I don't know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with the baby's name?
So, um- so how's this, uh, how's this gonna work? Y'know, with us? Y'know, when, like, important decisions have to be made?
Give me a 'for instance'.
Marlon-
Marlon?!
Hi. Uh, I have been in the bathroom. Stay clear of the salmon mousse.
I know.
Oh hello Ross, where have you been?
Oh, scotch neat. Ya know, that's Rachel's father's drink.
Oh, mine too. Isn't that neat, scotch neat. Would you excuse me? Hey, hey, where you uh, sneakin off to mister?
Uh, hold, let me see, I don't know. So what're you gonna do. . .
Oh, you know, I'm just gonna, I'm gonna hang out, work on my music.
Is my hook unhooked? These things keep falling down, I can't. . .
Oh, the guys are here.
this summer?
Doesn't sound as crazy as paying a thousand dollars for a cat.
Yeah.
You guys this cat is nothing like my grandmother's cat. I mean, it's not sweet, it's not cute, I even dragged that little string on the ground, and it just flipped out and scratched the hell out of me. And I swear, I know this sounds crazy, but every time this cat hisses at me I know it's saying, "Rachel!"
What?! You paid a thousand dollars for a cat when you owe me 300!!
Well, I was gonna let you play with it.
Hey Joe, while you're over there how about another beer for the Ross-A-Tron?
Okay, can I-can I make it up to you? Huh? I'm sorry. How about uh, dinner tomorrow night?! I'll pay for myself!
Okay, you wore me down.
The Ross-Is that back?!!
Hi!
I loved this place! To tell you the truth, I wish I didn't have to move.
I'm really gonna miss this apartment. Y'know, Ben-Ben took his first steps right over there.
Ohh. Hey, remember when I ran into this thing and it kinda knocked me out a little?
Uhh, are you saying that you're not entirely happy about this?
Well, I mean if uh, if Emily gave me a choice...
Four hundred, huh? Well, that sounds do-able. How much are the boxes?
Yeah.
So far, I've sold seventy-five.
Five dollars a box.
And what is second prize?
Was there...uh, huh, huh, huh... andybody, anybody else there.
All right, fine. Um, you were not the only one there. Joey was there too.
All right.
No.
You're sure? Nobody uh, handed out uh, mints or anything?
Hi Dr. Greene. So, uh, how's everything in the uh, vascular surgery....game?
Uhh, let's just stay clear of 'I'm the guy that's doing you daughter' and you should be ok.
Ok people, I want you to take a piece of paper, here you go, and write down your most embarassing memory. Oh, and I do ask that when you're not using the markers, you put the caps back on them because they will dry out.
It's not a game Ross, a woman died on my table today.
I'm sorry. See that's the good thing about my job. All the dinosaurs on my table are already dead.
Yes. I lived with you guys for a while and then I found this place. I'm Ross.
I gotta check out this hot girl! There she is!
Damnit!! Did you move?!
Yes?
Uhh do you happen to have a hot girl in there?
Well maybe he'll get to go soon, like on a class trip or something.
Very!
I know, isn't he great? It's so nice to finally be in a fun relationship, y'know? There's nothing boring about him, and ah, I bet he's never set foot in a museum.
Y'know what else is really great about him, oh, what is the word for the adult that doesn't have dinosaur toys in their bedroom?
Oh!
Oh, I've got to go pick up Ben, we've got a play date this afternoon.
Oh, okay Ross. Listen, this pen is kinda getting boring, so can you pick me up some porn?
Where ya going?
Ohh, with who?
Oh, just this woman that I met last night at the party.
Oh, no-no-no don't you worry about me falling asleep. I still have your letter!!!
Hey!!
Sorry!! I just feel bad about all that sleep you're gonna miss wishing you were with me!
And hey! Just so you know, it's not that common! It doesn't happen to every guy! And it is a big deal!!
I KNEW IT!!!!
By the way, the week before your wedding you may not see a lot of me.
Need some help?
No! You don't know the system! There'll be nobody messing with the system!
Oh, hello liar.
Look, I-I'm really sorry I let go of the bike.
Wow! We are pretty good at this! Hey! We totally forgot about lunch!
Are you serious?!
Yeah. I realized it about a half-hour ago but I didn't want to say anything 'cause I didn't want to jinx it.
Oh, I-I, I think that's the first time I ever missed a meal! Yeah, my pants are a little loose!
Hey, you guys...
Uh, just a sec dad. OK, be cool, just be cool. OK dad.
Ahh, are you hadsome.
Let's show 'em.
Rachel, ready or not, here comes your knight in shining. . . oh no.
Bye.
Yeah, not as much as you used to love to play uncooked batter eater.
Well, I don't know what's in the boxes down here, but I do know there are six or seven Easy Bake Ovens in the attic.
I used to love to play restaurant.
Hey, it is unreasonable to expect a child to wait for a light bulb to cook brownies!
So, I think you're boxes are over here.
Okay, y'know how you told me I should do whatever it takes to fix my marriage?
Hey. Rachel, I-I-I've been wanting to tell you something for a while now and I really, I just have to get it out.
Okay, what's up?
Yeah, I told you to give Emily whatever she wants.
And while that was good advice, you should know that what-what she wants...
Yeah, it's-it's tough being single. That's why I'm so glad I found Amanda.
Just go up to her and ask her out. Oh, what's the worst thing that could happen?
I could die.
Ross, you guys went out once. You took your kids to Chucky Cheese, and you didn't even kiss her.
I tell people secrets. It makes them like me.
You know how you throw your jacket on a chair at the end of the day?
...emblem of the land I love. The home of....
So, you just left? Her place was really that bad?
Yeah.
Well, like that, only instead of a chair, it's a pile of garbage. And instead of a jacket, it's a pile of garbage. And instead of the end of the day, it's the end of time, and garbage is all that has survived! Here.
It's her first day at this new job. Your not supposed to start with her!
Oh yeah, but don't worry. I don't think anybody's gonna focus on that as long as your wearing that towel dress.
Tell him.
All right, I suppose I can wait a day. Hey, what are you doing Friday?
Why?
You know what it's fine. If you're okay with the Barbi thing, so am I.
So he's got a doll? So what? Unless you're afraid he's gonna grow up and be in show business.
This doesn't have anything to do with the fact that he is being raised by two women, does it?
Give daddy the Barbi! Ben, give, give me the Barbi. Okay, how 'bout, don't you want to play with the monster truck? No. Okay, oh, oh, how about a Dino-soilder?
Ross, you are so pathetic. Why can't your son just play with his doll?
At least they knew what yours was. Y'know, yours had a name.
He couldn't even tell me! He said it was just some sort of skin... abnormality. And the worst thing is he-he-he said, he said, without being able to identify it, he was reluctant to remove it.
Y'know what? You should go to my guy, because when I went in there with my third nipple. He just lopped it right off. Y'know? So I guess I'm lucky. I mean not as lucky as people who were born with two nipples.
Oh! Maybe they'll name yours after you! Y'know, they'll call it, The Ross. And then people would be like, "Awww, he's got a Ross."
Yeah, that'd be cool!
No, that's, no, as long as you're okay. So I'll ah, I'll see you tomorrow.
So, I'll umm...
Oh, I'm sorry I spoiled you're evening.
Um-hmm, yeah.
See ya.
Well, we just wanted to say a quick hi, and then we're gonna go see the baby.
Julie! Julie, isn't that great? I mean, isn't that just kick-you-in-the-crotch, spit-on-your-neck fantastic?
It's an expression.
And then we've gotta get some sleep.
Yeah, it's really 6:00 tomorrow night our time.
Yeah, well, Hurricane Gloria didn't break the porch swing, Monica did!
It was you?
And Dad, y'know that mailman that you got fired? He didn't steal your Playboys! Ross did!
Ross hasn't worked at the museum for a year!
Monica and Chandler are living together!
I've been thinking, this is crazy, I mean don't, don't you think we can work on this?
No. A break from us.
Then, we had this big, stupid fight, and I said I wanted to take a break, I don't want to take a break.
Hey, what do you want to drink?
Who's that?
Oh my God, the wedding book?! I haven't seen that since the forth grade!
Okay!
What in God's name is that?!
This baby has got everything. Take y'know, locations for instance. First, organized alphabetically, then geographically, then by square footage.
That is so smart! Break it off. Break it off now.
There you go. You put on a tuxedo! Now that wasn't so scary, was it?
Ugh! Joey, I have to go.
Hey! Don't you hang up on me! I'll marry you and me right now! I have the power!
No.
I'm telling you, just a little bit at a time.
Okay. Uh, huh. Excuse me, I'm sorry, I-I think you may be in our seats.
Oh! Yeah.
Yeah.
Umm, no, I don't think so.
Can-can we take a look at your ticket?
Uh Joey, that's just the minumum amount due, that's your total due.
Woah.
Look at this, how did I spend so much money?
Ahh.
What, woah, woah, $3500 at porcelain safari?
That, for all I knew would, could last forever. That to me is a break-up.
Look, I didn't think there was a relationship to jeopardise. I thought we were broken up.
We were on a break!
You think you're gonna get out of this on a technicality?
Look, I'm not trying to get out of anything, okay. I thought our relationship was dead!
Joey! This is like the last commercial. You've got like ten minutes left!
All guys that are awake. Then we go to sleep and then all the guys from the other end of the world wake up and behave the exact same way.
All right, it's another commercial; I still haven't told her!
I know, I know! What am I going to do? Ooh!
No! You are not gonna run out and leave her here!
What did you want to show us? Because all I can see is this bitchin' van!
Our eyes are closed and we're about to cross the street. Very good.
Okayyyyy, open up!
Yeah, it's for our catering business!
I think I know that girl.
No, no I don't, because it's being restrung, somebody was supposed to bring me one.
Uh.. uh.. Well, Joey and I had discussed getting in an early morning racquetball game. But, um, apparently, somebody overslept.
Yeah, well, you don't have your racket.
Yeah, well you didn't call and leave your grip size.
Okay, you guys spend waaaay too much time together.
Why does Joanna need two assistants, how, how lazy is she?
Ohhhhh yeah, that's, that's funny. Why ah, why isn't he goofing around in his own office?
Oh honey, this is his office too. I told you we're Joanna's two assistants.
Oh! Oh my God! What did I just do?
What?
Y'know, if, if this is too weird for you, we can still back out at...
We're really gonna do this, huh?
Looks like it.
I got it!
Okay.
Yeah well, if I know Mark, and I think I do, I'd expect nothing less.
He even offered to meet me for lunch tomorrow to prep me for it.
Oh, that is amazing!
I got to figure out what I'm going to wear.
High collar and baggy pants say I'm a pro.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Come on, come on, what. You took his underwear?
Hey, what you do on your own time...
Where's my underwear?!
He took my essence!
Okay, now hold on. Joey, why, why can't you just wear the underwear you're wearing now?
Oh, great. It's starting to rain, that will make it easy to get a cab.
Maybe it was his sister's. You know, maybe it was his daughter's.
Michelle! Of course, it was Michelle! Did it sound like Michelle?
It was Michelle. It was definitely Michelle.
Pheebs, you go with Monica and try on her green dress. If that doesn't work, you can wear my gray silk one. Oh, gosh, what am I wearing?!
Can I come over tomorrow and pick up Fluffy Meowington's cat toy.
Oh, Monica, I figured I'd come by tomorrow morning and pick up Fluffy's old cat toy, OK?
Only if you say his full name.
Alright.
You're getting a cat?
You did so. I swear, I swear How long has she been in the bathroom?
Call me!
It's not true. I never called your mother a wolverine.
Uh, I don't think she's in the bathroom. Her coat is gone.
Well maybe it's cold in there. Or maybe I screwed up the first date I had in 9 years.
Okay, I'll be up in, 18 pages. Front and back. Very exciting.
Okay. Wow, it's-it's 5:30 in the morning. So, I'd better get cracking on this baby.
Well, I'll be waiting for you, just come up when you're done.
Oh. Oh-oh.
Hey! What happened to you? Why didn't you come up?
I dunno, maybe it's because you're really sarcastic. Or maybe it's cause you uh-
Yeah, they don't like you.
Do you know why?
Well if people don't know they shouldn't just guess!
This is great, another Thanksgiving with nothing to give thanks for.
I guess when you don't have so many distractions, it's easier for you to focus. Huh?
Great! Now, we can go to the Ranger game! Last night!
No dude, Ross tore up the tickets!
Yeah or also when you don't have somebody breathing down your neck ALL THE LIVE LONG DAY!!
Yeah, well, that's fine, but the important thing is that I finished it. And uh, I think it's really good, but y'know it'd really help me is if I could hear it. So would you guys read it for me?
Oh, we went to see a collection of Victorian doorknobs and the Cupert-Hewitt museum.
Hey!
Hey, what have you guys been up too?
Without me?!
My uncle dragged us there. But, it actually it turned out to be really interesting.
And listen, man, if you wanna be gay, be gay. Doesn't matter to me.
...Chandler!
Hey.
You were right.
Rachel. Rachel Rachel. I love you the most.
Well, how about this year, instead of Santa, we have fun celebrating Hanukkah?
Okay, it's not a contest.
When is Santa coming?
No Santa? Was I bad?
No! Oh, no-no-no. Hey, you weren't bad, you've been very good, Ben.
Oh you know, pretty much the usual, uh, sun shining, birds chirping.
Woah, hey, yo.
So, uh, how was your day?
Really? Mine too.
Hey cool, mine too.
No Rach! Come on! No-no! Yeah, I'm sure we won't get arrested for this.
Yeah, I'll get right on that.
Oh come on Ross!!
Hi officer, was I going a little too fast?
Oh my God.
Thanks. Yeah, Carol borrowed it for a class, and I have to get it back to the museum.
No, she's at a faculty meeting.
Oh, I uh, just came by to pick up my skull. Well, not mine, but...Susan: Come in.
What's it look like?
Kinda like a big face without skin.
Unbelievable! I mean you really kept Joey's underwear?! Why? Why would you do that?!
I guess I set up the video camera to try and entice Joey.
But sadly I could not be enticed.
I'm Monica. I'm disgusting. I stalk guys and keep their underpants.
Well, I think we've all learned something about who's disgusting and who's not. Eh? All right, now, I'm going to get back to my bucket. I'm only eating the skin, so the chicken's up for grabs.
Hi. It's nice to meet you. I used to have a friend named Joey. I don't anymore.
Well uh, Ross? This is Joey. Joey? Ross.
Hi!
Our table will be ready in a couple minutes.
Yeah. So...
Chandler, I want you to run a post pattern to the left, okay. And sweetie..
Well I don't like to say it out loud, but, yeah! Don't feel bad man, we all have our strengths. You're better with numbers and stuff.
Math!! You're giving me math! All right, look y'know what, forget about it, you go for the girl, we'll see who gets her.
Yeah, I know, go long. Y'know, it's like all I'm doing is running back and forth from the huddle.
Well ah, you wanna just stay out there?
Yeah, but I'm your brother. We're family. That's the most important thing in the world.
Yeah.
I can't be fair. You're my boyfriend.
Don't try to sway her. I'm your only chance to have a baby. Okay, let's go.
We'll each tell you how we came up with the joke and then you decide which one of us is telling the truth-me.
She doesn't know which one of us she wants, me or this Colin guy.
Ross umm, there's something that I've got to tell you, there's-there's someone else.
Does that mean the same thing in England as it does in America?
This isn't how it's supposed to go, there can't be another guy.
Well...
Wow! This is so amazing. I uh, I really thought I'd have to talk you into this more.
Yes, exactly!
And I will make everyone call me Mrs. Geller!
Okay, see now I'm scared because I don't actually think you're kidding.
I'm-I'm not kidding. Look I-I, I can't have three failed marriages. I can't. Okay? I-I am not gonna be that guy!
Oh yeah, about telling Mom and Dad, I was thinking about maybe writing a letter.
Five minutes ago, a line like that would've floored me. Now nothing. Well, not nothing, I am still a woman.
Ross? Let's go.
Alright, you know what? That's it. You've had your chance.
Wha-what?
Hey Pheebs, could you please not put your feet up on my new......old sheet?
Aww!
That's funny.
Oh sure! Noo!
Ohh!!
Enough with geography for the insane, okay? Let's play some ball, guys.
Nice try. See the Netherlands is this make believe place where Peter Pan and Tinker Bell come from.
Oh, my.
Whoa, whoa, no, no, I-I'm not playing with this guy, now.
Fine with me.
Okay umm, bad stuff. Well, I'm-I'm 12 years older than she is.
Y'know, maybe she is too young for me. Y'know, when I was over there and she was running around with her friends, I felt like I was a baby-sitter. I finally started to see what you guys were talking about. I don't know what to do.
Why don't you just weigh out the good stuff about the relationship against the bad stuff. I mean that's what I did when I first weighing stuff.
If the school finds out you're fired.
Hmm.
Well if it doesn't matter to her, it doesn't matter to me! Still not yelling!
Y'know what daddy? If you don't like Ross, that's fine. It doesn't matter to me, I'm gonna go out with him anyway.
Really?!
Wow. What can I say? This doesn't make me like you any better!
That's okay, I'm not so crazy about myself right now either.
-she, of course, she- uh- familiar with our.. special situation?
..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he-
She.
Yes, and she's very supportive.
Okay, that's great. No, I'm- Oh.
Okay, I know what I have to do. I've got to go Red Ross. Y'know, Red Ross!
Hi.
Whoa! I kinda liked it.
I totally don't know what you're talking about.
Come on! The time we were all waiting in line for Dances With Wolves and that one guy cut in line in front of us and I just lost it?! Screamed at him! Turned all red! Red Ross!!
What? A-ohh! Ohh. Oh that's right that's right. That's Richard's favorite place too.
Who?
Richard!
Oh you knew that. Good!
I thought you were going out with Elizabeth.
Not even if Carol's breast had a picture of a missing child on it.
No!
Not even if you just pretend that it's milk?
Hey, where is everybody?
They took Ben to the park. Where've you been?
Hey, do you guys think that if all those things happened, we'd still hang out?
Well why didn't you take the job?
Because at that time you see, I thought everything that rhymed was true. So I thought y'know that if I'd work with stocks, I'd have to live in a box, and only eat lox, and have a pet fox.
Oh my God! Rachel Green?
Rob Tillman!
You're drunk! Mom and dad are gonna be maaaaadd! Maybe I'm a little drunk.
Will you quit hoggin' it!
I'm telling you it's like watching Bambi learn how to walk.
Oh that's great! Right there! Can we get some of that over here please? There we go.
Hey! Are those crab cakes? Did I not tell ya to come straight to me when more crab cakes were ready?
Y'know if we ever go to war and you're captured, you're in for a big surprise.
No?
I just walked in the bathroom and saw Kathy naked! It was like torture!
It just keeps getting worse and worse! Y'know? I mean it's bad enough that I'm in love with my roommates girlfriend-which by the way, I think she knows. Because every time we're in the room together there's this weird like energy between us. And call me crazy, but I think she likes me too. And now I have seen her naked. I mean at least when I've seen her with clothes on, I could imagine her body was like covered in boles or something. But there are no boles, she's smooth! Smooth!
Wow! Could everyone totally see up his robe?
God, that was, that was amazing, that was incredible. You guys, you guys kicked butt.
Hey.
Hey.
Us, what about you guys? Man you really, bing, gave it to old Mr. Clean back there. He was a big guy.
Yeah he was wasn't he.
Hey Pheebs, what 'cha reading? Pheebs? Hello? Phoebe? Phoe-Phoebe! Come on!
See ya!
Well, wait a minute! The puss is good! It means it's healing!
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't see you there.
Phoebe, are you, are you mad at me, or something? 'Cause if are please, tell me what it is I did!
Hey, does anybody want to get some lunch? All those in favor say I?
Hey Rach, remember that great song, Me, Myself, and I?
Monica! Come on!
Ross! Stop it! Come on!
How much did I love The King and I?
Well, that just leaves the big Green poker machine, who owes fifteen...
Oh, I cursed it. So now bad things will happen to he who spends it.
That's alright, I'll take it. Bad things happen to me anyway. This way I can break 'em up with a movie.
Mmm-hmmm. Oh, so typical. Ooo, I'm a man. Ooo, I have a penis. Ooo, I have to win money to exert my power over women.
You know what? This is not over. We will play you again, and we will win, and you will lose, and you will beg, and we will laugh, and we will take every last dime you have, and you will hate yourselves forever.
Hey, is Rachel here? Um, I wanted to wish her a happy birthday before I left.
Yeah.
Hi, Ben. I'm your father. I am... the head. Aaaaaahhhh.... Alright, this barbecue is gonna be very fun.
Oh no, she's out having drinks with Carl.
Oh. Hey, who's Carl?
She says as time goes on, he's gonna start getting agressive and violent.
She says Marcel's humping thing's not a phase. Apparently he's reached sexual maturity.
Hey! He beat ya.
So what does this mean?
I'm gonna have to give him up.
Uh, before we do uh, are any of Joey's special romance magazines in there?
Hi, we have a little bathroom emergency.
Oh, yeah go ahead.
No. No.
Okay! All clear!
Actually she's a paleontology doctoral candidate, specializing in the centazoic era.
Where did you, when did you, how did you... How did you get a girl like that?
Yeah, so what is she, like a... like a spokesmodel, or an aerobics instructor, what?
Okay, but that's, like, the easiest era.
I've seen her at work, but I always figured, ah-huh? But, uh, I made her dinner. We had a great time. And we're going out again tomorrow.
My God. Rachel! Your here. I can't believe it. What happen? Why are you here?
Ohh... Oh! You were not meant to see me before the wedding. It's bad luck.
You know what, I think we've had all the bad luck we're going to have.
Well I just came... I just needed to tell you... Congratulations.
Hello, Waltham Interiors.
...run it all over your body until you're... trembling with... with...
....and....
Say it... say it!
....with??
Funny story!
Anyway. That's when our Mom said we were not to play football ever again.
Yes, it was the trophy you got if you won the game. But our Dad said, 'nobody won that game, ' and he was sick of our fighting, so he took the trophy and.... threw it in the lake.
And was the curse lifted?
Y'know what, I think we should play a game. I mean come on, it's been twelve years.
Can I see you for a second?
Phoebe, you can't get out of this! Okay? You have to learn how to ride a bike!
Okay, now just remember everything I taught you and you'll be fine. Okay? Here we go. Ready...Set...
Wait! This seat is really uncomfortable! Yeah, maybe before we start we should just get another one. Perhaps, like an airplane seat-or a beanbag chair!
Why? Why do I have to learn?
Well...In-in case of emergency.
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
I don't know, I mean you were a lot bigger, I mean, stronger back then.
I can do it, okay? Come on, let's go.
I can't do it!
Now you do that, you're on TV.
Okay, okay, okay, I've got two cabs and no people. Go! Go! Go!
Good-bye.
Noooo!!!!
Maybe we could call the phone company. Maybe they could change the message. Maybe they can change his number.
Yeah, after this, I think he'll be doing that himself.
Uhh, yeah. I mean, actually I kinda think that we'll have, we'll have two babies.
What?
You think about stuff like that?
Two, two babies?
Yeah. Ya know, a boy and a girl. Hopefully the girl will come first so Ben here won't feel too competitive.
Well, I'm gonna go see her. I want to bring her something, what do you think she'll like?
I know. I feel horrible. Okay.
Says here that a muppet got whacked on Seasame Street last night. Where exactly were around ten-ish?
Maybe a Hello Kitty doll, the ability to walk...
I'm gonna get back to retraining.
Oh, darnit, we're all out of milk. Hey Chandler, would you fill me up here?
I can't believe you're dressing up for him. I mean, you're just, you're setting yourself up all over again.
OK, no. For your information I'm going to see him so I can put all those feeling behind me. OK, and the reason I'm dressed like this is because I think it's nice to look nice for your gay husband.
Oh I see, I see, because of the third nipple thing. Ha ha ha ha. . .
OK sweetie, I'll see you later.
It's old, it's definitely old. Didn't you hear the, the double beep?
"Monica, it's Richard. Call me."
Is-is-is that message old or new? Old or new?! Old or new?!
What if it's new? I mean, we agreed not to talk again, unless we had something really important to say. Shouldn't I call him back?
Honey, you did call him back. 'Cause, it's, it's really old.
I'm giving this lecture on erosion theories tomorrow night, I think you should come.
Y'know what would cheer you up?
What?
You're right! That did cheer me up!
Hey, you're not going to believe this. I made up a joke and sent it in to Playboy. They printed it!
How can I not get this? I'm a college professor; I got 1450 on my S.A.T.s.
It hurts my teeth.
And I don't wanna say this, I don't you guys to hate me, but uh, I don't think, I can be around that dog anymore. Okay, so either the dog goes, or I go. Oh my god!!
1250.
Damn, I forgot you were here.
Tell my son that I love him. Excellent! Well, okay, I gotta have some more fun!
Thanks. I-I think I'm dying. I really do.
Oh, poor baby.
Ross, they are killing you out there!
That's not true!
Oh yeah! Batch 17 was good. I did not like batch 16. I'm okay.
Which one was that?
The ones we had right after you almost threw up.
Are there anymore from the good batch? 'Cause we could just work off of those.
Yeah, ooh yeah, I think there is one from batch 17 left, uh... It's batch 16! 16 people! Get out of the way!
Okay the sleeping thing. Very tricky business, but there is something you can do.
Bye sweetie.
Bye hon.
Well, I thought you guys were cuddlily sleepers.
Noo! No, not cuddlily, not me, just her. I'm like you, I need the room. Okay, come here. Okay, you're in bed...
Yeah, it's, it's, it's cute. Why, why, why does he have it, again?
He picked it out of the toy store himself, he loves it.
He carries it everywhere, it's like a security blanket, but with ski boots and a kicky beret.
So he's got a doll? So what? Unless you're afraid he's gonna grow up and be in show business.
This doesn't have anything to do with the fact that he is being raised by two women, does it?
Well I told you it was Chandler who was smoking the pot but it was me. I'm sorry.
You are such a tattletale! Mom, Dad, you remember that-that time you walked in my room and smelled marijuana?
Yes.
It was you?
And Dad, y'know that mailman that you got fired? He didn't steal your Playboys! Ross did!
Still I could tell. She was into me. Well, why don't you set us up?
The one that always stares at me when I come in?
No, the one who looked at you once because you got in her way.
Ohh, are you setting Ross up with someone? Does she have a wedding dress?
Hey.
OK. Here goes. For a while now, I've been wanting to, um....
OK, I have a question. Well, actually, it's not so much a question as.. more of a general wondering... ment.
OK.
Ohhh!!!!
Yes, yes, that's right...
Hey, what took you guys so long? Your cab left when ours did!
Okay, uh Pheebs, quick. Look! This is for the babies to look at someday, so is-is there anything you want to say? Y'know before it all starts?
Oh, okay, umm, hi kids! Um, it's me, Aunt Phoebe. I can't wait to see you. Please don't hurt me!
Well, we-we had to go back because I forget my jacket.
That's right.
Oh my God! Those weren't albino kids, that was computer camp! Rach!
Thanks. What photo album was it?
I don't know, it was you and a bunch of albino kids.
Hey.
Hey.
I'm having... I'm having a baby. I'm having a... Where's the phone? The phone?
Ooh, Ooh.
What?
I don't know where the phone is.
Ross?
Ah, well, it means that I can sell cookies, but I'm not invited to sleep-overs.
No, hi, I'm, I'm an honorary Brown Bird
What does that mean?
I can dial 9-1-1 at the touch of a button, y'know. Now, go away!
No, please, please, um, it's for a poor little girl who wants to go to Spacecamp more than anything in the world.
Should we all expect Christmas gifts that can be stolen from your office?
They couldn't be worse. I spent eight hours calling him last night, just trying to get him to talk to me.
Oh wow, eight hours? So you could probably really use one of those plug-in telephone headsets huh?
You shouldn't.
Speaking of Christmas, umm since Monica and I are starting a new business and have like no money, umm, this year maybe we could do secret Santa, and then we each only buy one gift. And-and there's the added mystery of who gets who.
Oh hey! Hey uh, you remember the necklace I gave you last year? Can I see it?
Chandler?
The meaning of the box is three fold. One , it gives me the time to think about what I did. Two , it proves how much I care about my friendship with Joey. And three , it hurts!
Why?
I just wanna check something.
Yes, I suppose I am a dog. But Issac, see I-I happen to have a girlfriend.
You tell, of course you do. Issac. Issac. Hey, Issac. Issac, hi! Y'know we haven't actually met...
You dog!
Oh right, that Rachel chick from the coffee place.
Yeah, that's the one. Listen, I don't want to hurt her.
So what're you saying here? I should shave again, pick up some wine, what?
Nuh-uh.
Yuh-huh.
Well, you may wanna rethink the dirty underwear. This is basically the first time she's gonna see your underwearyou want it to be dirty?
No.
I always knew I was havin a baby, I just never realised the baby was having me.
Im gonna be a father.
This is just occurring to you?
Oh, youre gonna be great!
Aw, how can you say that? I cant even get Marcel to stop eating the bath mat. How am I gonna raise a kid?
Monica, uh Dad called this morning and ah, Aunt Silvia passed away.
Hey!
Hey!
Yes!! Yes! Yeah, yeah, yeah!
We were all pretty shaken up about it.
Listen, Roland Chang, if things go well, I'm gonna be out with her all night.
Yeah.
Right on! Oh! Uh, but, don't take to long okay? 'Cause uh, we're gonna test out our fake ID's tonight, right Clifford Alverez.
Dude, don't do that too me!
All right, it's cool you can stay here. My parents won't mind.
Hey hold on, hold on. How much for the uh, how much to save the bird?
What?
I can't watch this.
1200.
Dollars? You spent $1200 dollars on a plastic bird?
Oh, on a date. Yeah, I met this girl on the train going to a museum upstate.
15? Your personal best!
Where were you?
Oh, yeah! How did you meet her?
Oh, which museum?
Marcel! Marcel! Marcel, no! Good boy. See, how can nobody want him?
Oh God. We didn't get into Scranton. That was like our safety zoo. They take like dogs and cows. See? I don't know who this is harder on, me or him.
I'd say that chair's taking the brunt.
Oh, somebody will.
You know there already is a Joseph Stalin?
Yeah. So um, I-I heard about this ah, Mark guy that ah, Rachel met today.
Hi.
Hi.
Isn't that great?
Oh yeah! So ah, kinda pretty, pretty good. He sounds like a nice, good guy.
Good, so everybody's here. Everybody's good. So, were you gonna play something, Phoebe?
Hi, Julie. Hi, Julie. Julie, um, how are you?
Good.
Oh, well, actually.
Play it.
Look Ben, it's a toy that protects U.S. oil interests overseas!
G.I. Joe? Do you really think he's gonna fall for that?
G. I. Joe! Cool! Can I play?
Go Joe!!!
Helloo! Oh!
Fine, y'know what, that's it. From now on, Joey, I want you to be my best man.
Hey, how can it not be me?!HeyHey!
I'm not even... I'm not even...
Yes! Shame about you man.
Stop it!
Oh, you could just go uh, "greatest of ease... BAH-bah-bha-bhannn." Then go right into it.
Who's Elaine?
"Little, tiny Tarzan, swinging on a nose hair. Swinging with the greatest of ease..." Darn it! Now, I don't know who to get to the next verse.
Yeah, ooh, I like that! Yeah. Wait! How do you know about 'bah-bah-bha-bhan?'
Well umm, y'know, I used to play.
You know, I might have expected this of you Phoebe, but Ryan, you're a military man.
Now do me, do my back. Oh come on, harder.
Oh, stop that, stop that right now.
You and Milton have to join us on the boat. Karen'll pack a lunch, you'll bring the kids, we'll make a day of it.
Oh, that sounds lovely. We're gonna have to set that up. Oh, I better get back. Hope the baby feels better.
You don't have a valid driver's license-Okay that is it! Pull over right now!
You've seen my huge stack of porn right?
God. I forgot how much I love driving. I have got to get my license renewed.
Oh Ross you're so tense! You just gotta relax okay? Just need to relax all right? Just need to relax...
What-what are you doing?! Are you-Okay that's not funny! Just stop horsing around!
No! Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah! You can have this back when the five pages are done! Ahh!
And shame on you! You should know better, Joey needs to work. Now come on!
Hey!
I had a really nice time tonight.
So did I. I'm really glad Monica asked us out.
You can see the moonlight bouncing off her head! What the hell were you thinking?!!
Okay, have fun! Wooo!!
Come on see, she doesn't look that bad.
I don't know.
You don't know?! Rach, you balded my girlfriend!
Oh-ho, whoa! Sorry, Tommy. I almost spilled this hot coffee on you.
Oh, I...
Why don't you use ours across the hall, 'cause she...has...problems.
Yeah, but you didn't.
No, but it's-it's-it's hot!
I don't know what to do. What am I gonna do? I mean, this, this is like a complete nightmare.
Why didn't he call? He's gonna stay with Julie, isn't he? He's gonna stay with her and she's going to be all, "Hi, I'm Julie, Ross picked me, and we're gonna to get married, have a lot of kids and dig up stuff together."
No offense, but that sounds nothing like her.
Oh, I know. This must be so hard. Oh, no. Two women love me. They're both gorgeous and sexy. My wallet's too small for my fifties, and my diamond shoes are too tight.
Hey, here's a thought, Ross.
Okay, stay calm. Nothing is going to happen to you, you are not in that much trouble.
I am not horsing around okay? I am Porsching around.
Uh-oh.
Really? You think so?
I was talking to myself! You're going down!
Ehh, I don't, I don't think so. She's already talked about y'know, dating other guys.
I've been back and forth.
Yeah well, maybe you should go back! Okay? Rachel moves in, and before you know it you're right where you don't want to be! Back together!
That's not gonna work out! Then she's gonna come home all weepy and you'll be tellin' her, "Oh that's okay. You'll find someone." And then, bamn! She finds you!
Yeah, well, m-maybe you're right.
That's great! Are you happy now? Look what you did with your funny, funny form!
Well, yes, we got married in Vegas and uh, and the names I think.
Well, based on what I heard, you two certainly don't qualify for an annulment. If you two don't want to be together you'll have to file for divorce.
What?! Me?! What about you and your consummated like bunnies nonsense!
And what--What are you typing that for? Did you hear what she said? We don't get the annulment. Don't type that! What?! Stop typing! Hey! Stop typing! Stop typing! Stop typing!!
Well, I guess I'm gonna call the beer company and try to find out where he is.
Check it out, he actually is the MonkeyShine monkey.
Well, so what're you gonna do?
That's what I did when I lost my Clydesdales.
OK, hi again.
Yeah, but not very well, unless 14-across, 'Gershwin musical' actually is bitemebitemebitemebiteme.
Ooh, goooosh, ooh, these are cookies smashed in the sports section.
Oh look, and he did my crossword puzzle.
I can't believe it's Christmas already. Ya know, I mean, one day your eatin' turkey, the next thing ya know, your lords are a-leapin' and you geese are a-layin'.
Which is why geese are so relaxed this time of year.
That's, that's, that's a big candy bar. I had the most amazing time with you.
I just, I had to see you one more time before you took-off.
You are so sweet.
Me too.
This is the final boarding call for Flight 009.
So don't, I don't see why we have to go to this thing anyway, it's your ex-fiancee's wedding.
Oh my God, you look so good!
I can not believe I have to walk down the aisle in front of 200 people looking like something you drink when your nauseous.
Because I promised Mindy I would.
Yeah, well you promised Barry, you'd marry him.
Hey! Okay! I got my passport, fresh socks, and a snake bite kit!
Really?!
Oh yeah, it's beautiful country up there.
It's not gonna be exactly like last time.
All right, I'll see you guys.
Oh, mom. Mom. Chandler hates Thanksgiving and doesn't eat any Thanksgiving food.
Okay.
I'm so glad you could come Chandler, we've got plenty of food so I hope you're hungry.
Oh, well, I'm so glad you brought him here then.
Umm, Chandler, if you want I can make you some macaroni and cheese for dinner.
It went great! And I didn't need any jokes or naked chicks either!
Hey!
How'd the lecture go?
Wow, that's great Ross, I'm sorry we weren't more supportive before.
I knew all I had to do was let the material speak for itself. Everyone's all, "Ross you have to be funny and sexy." Well, I proved them wrong! And now, I'm gonna pass the news onto Joey and Chandler.
Y'know, I think they have those at that British pub near the trade center.
Ohh...
Y'know, I'd walk back to London for another frosty one of those bad boys.
Later!
Isn't Rachel supposed to be back by now?
I prefer not to answer that right now, I'm still carrying a little holiday weight.
All right.
Oh my... How much do you weigh Ross?!
Y'know, when we talked about face to face, I don't think we thought it all the way through.
So what do you want me to do?
Um, that is because my doctor says that I have a very serious.... nuget.... diffency.
Hi there!
Hi. And batting for Sarah, Ross Geller, 872. Although, it looks like you bought an awful lot of cookies yourself.
Tell us what happened, Brown Bird Ross.
Well, I lost. Some little girl loaned her uniform to her nineteen year old sister, who went down to the U.S.S. Nimitz, and sold over 2,000 boxes.
Because, I'm finally getting him excited about Hanukkah, and, and you're-you're wrecking it.
Thank you, but, but you gotta leave.
Why?
But I didn't get to shape my belly like a bowl full of jelly.
I'm sorry, Chandler but this, this is really important to me.
Right, they are scary. Ahh, she just ate a treat out of my hand!!!
Told ya.
They are needy, they are jumpy, and you can't tell what they are thinking, and that scares me a little bit.
Wait a minute. Do you not like all dogs? I mean, not even puppies?
Is there a puppy here?
Oh. Oh, that's right. So-so you did see me that day because it seemed like you didn't.
Hey!
It's been so long! Last time I saw you, you were setting up your tent in line to see Return of the Jedi.
Ah yeah, sorry about that.
It's okay. Come, come on in.
Ah! Well uh-uh, t-take it downstairs, y'know give it a test ride.
Ahh.
Not that way! But the bike brought you a lot closer!
Okay! Oh my God! My first bike! Thank you for the best present I've ever gotten.
You're welcome.
I know, I wasn't finished. But don't worry! We're gonna go down the fire escape!!
Yeah, I guess we don't have a choice. Help us! Please help us! We're stuck up on the roof and we can't get down!!!
Ross. I was thinking we could just go down the fire escape.
Shhhhhhhhh!!! I'm sorry, I thought maybe I'd make some warm milk and it would help me sleep.
With a wok? I thought you were going to read my boring book to put you asleep.
It would really help when I'm kissing you if you didn't shout out my sister's name.
I know, I just didn't want to wear my glasses on my first date.
Monica.
Honey, I'm just checking.
Oh.
So tell me something. What does the phrase 'no date pact' mean to you?
Okay, what the hell, what the hell. You want me to actually throw you or you-you wanna just hop?
I can hop.
I'm sorry, okay. It's just that Chandler has somebody, and Phoebe has somebody- I thought I'd ask Fun Bobby.
Fun Bobby? Your ex-boyfriend Fun Bobby?
Wooooooo, hehehe. Hey, ahh, you don't feel like you're gonna throw up, do ya?
How did it go?
Had the money in the wrong hand.
No.
Well, I do, so let's... So, Ben, you uh, you know what holiday is coming up, don't ya?
Good, good, good. So, is uh, was your moustache, did, used to be different?
Rachel. Hey.
Hey. They're just trying to decide somehting.
No.
Oh. How do you uh, ya know, keep it so neat?
Sorry! Sorry! Oh, there! Hey Gary, who am I? Phone home!
Yeah, no problem.
Ross!
Look at Officer Ross riding back here with the visitors.
Yeah, what's up with that Serpico?
Hello? No she can't come to the phone right now. Oh, right no problem. Okay, bye-bye.
I got it!
Give it!
Was it my work? Were they mad? Was it Jack? Did he yell?!
J-j-just relax, nobody yelled. Jack just was calling to make sure that you were getting better.
I like it, and Emily likes it, and that's what counts. So uh, how are you guys doing?
Oh yeah, Emily convinced me to do it.
You do know that Wham broke up?
Oh-no, don't try and talk all normal with that thing in your ear.
Where is Emily?
I've gotta go, there's a deer just outside eating fruit from the orchard!
When we first met her, she was soaking, her feet were wet! Who wouldn't be miserable? I'm telling you when I got her into a dry pair of shoes, she was a totally different person.
Ross! Come quickly! There's a deer just outside eating fruit from the orchard!
He had to go, there's a deer just outside eating fruit from the orchard.
I don't get this! She was horrible!
Wow Monica! Hey, just so you know I had my uh, older brother chat with Chandler.
Hi! Oh you guys look so beautiful!
Mr. and Mrs. Bing!
What is that?
Well I...I told him that if he ever hurt you I would hunt him down and kick his ass! What?! What?! What is the matter with everybody?! I am serious! I would kick his ass!
We're shushing... because... we're trying to hear something. Listen. Don't you hear that?
Shhhh!
What are you shushing?
Ahhhh!
See?
Well, I'm gonna go get ready, for my date tonight, so ah, I'll just_ head.
Monica knows.
It's this dumb thing that Ross made up `cause he was trying to fool our parents. It's a way of giving the finger, without actually having to give it. I remember I cried the night you made it up, `cause it was the first time that I realized that I was actually cooler than my older brother.
Yeah, I should go to, `cause I'm playing in one hour. Hey, you guys should come hear me, ooh hear me. Ooh, My sticky shoes--eww! Eww! I lost my sexy phlegm!
Hi!
Oh you guys, I-I really think just one of us should go out there so she's not overwhelmed...
Paolo, I-I just want to tell you and I think I speak for everyone when I say...
Oh, just look at her...
Oh, you're right.
...and I really think it should be me.
Who-who wants fair? Y'know, I just want things back. Y'know, the way they were.
Okay!
-but that wouldn't be fair to me, it wouldn't be fair to Alan- It wouldn't be fair to you!
I'm sorry..
Oh, she's sorry! I feel better!
No! The guy is mean. I mean really mean. I think you should stay away from him.
Look. Look, I wasn't going to say anything to you, but... All right, I don't think you should be seeing Tommy anymore.
You don't?!
Umm, or, maybe, I should stay away from all men.
No, it's not just 'cause I'm jealous. I mean I'm not, I'm not, I'm not jealous, okay? It's... Look, the guy, he screamed, he actually screamed at this couple sitting in our seats.
That's right, he's not Drake, he's Hans Remore, Drake's evil twin.
Drake, what're you getting at?
I'm not Drake.
Is this true?
Yes, yes it is true. And I know this because, because he pretended to be Drake to, to sleep with me.
Yeah, yeah, everybody's here. Hey, everybody, say hi to Julie in New Mexico.
Oh my god. You are pure evil.
Ok, pure evil, horny and alone. I've done this.
Hi, Julie!
Hi, Julie.
Yeah, yeah I mean, you get your money and you learn a little something, what's wrong with that?
Here you go, you can pay me back whenever you like.
You have dinosaur checks?
Nothin', nothin', hey you're a cheapasaurus. I'm kidding, I'm kidding, thank you, I'm very greatful.
Hey, Mon, what is this?
But I don't know it. What I do know is that you owe $2300 at Isn't it Chromantic.
I am your friend.
Well then tell me things like, 'Joey you'll be fine,' and, 'Hang in there,' and, and, 'Somethin' big's fonna come along, I know it.'
Hey Ross, I'm aware of what I owe.
Ok, well then get some sense. I mean it took you what, 10 years to get that job, who knows how long it's gonna be till you get another.
Yeah, yeah man don't do it. I mean if you date her, then-then-then I can't date her.
Ugh, I cannot wait to ask her out!
Wait a minute...Joey. Joey you can't ask her out, she's your roommate. It-it'll be way too complicated.
All right, think about it. Now remember when you were going out with that girl Donna and you guys broke up. Remember how horrible it was when you guys bumped into each other at the supermarket?
Oh God, yeah.
It doesnt matter. You dont dip your pen in the company ink.
Oh, Net Usage Statistics, right. Gotcha, gotcha. Wont happen again. I wouldnt want to do anything to hurt your... "wenus."
Its not just that shes cute, okay. Its just that... shes really really cute.
Ross, your little creatures got the remote again.
Marcel, Marcel, give Rossie the remote. Marcel. Marcel, you give Rossie the remote right now... Marce... you give Rossie the remote...
Exactly, it'll be illegal for him to drink at his own bachelor party.
Yeah, ah, but Pheebs don't you think he's a little young to get married?
What, he's 18.
Yeah, or-or to get a hooker.
Always illegal Joe.
Hey! Look who's back! It's the birthday girl! How's the birthday girl feeling?
No I know, because to be a grandmother you have to be married and have children and I don't have any of those things. That's why it's so funny.
All you had to do was buy the card!
Well, I feel fine, but I think you're bumming out the rest of the kids.
What?
And tell them what? The naked guy we stare at all the time isn't moving.
I'm tellin' ya, he hasn't moved since this morning.
All right, we should call somebody.
Well, we have gotta find out if he's alive.
How are we gonna do that? There's no way.
Yeah, well you never have the time. I mean, I don't feel like I even have a girlfriend anymore, Rachel.
Yeah, well excuse me for wanting to be with my girlfriend on our anniversary, boy what an ass am I.
But I told you, I didn't have the time!
Wh, Ross what do you want from me? You want me, you want me to quit my job so you can feel like you have a girlfriend?
No, but it'd be nice if you realised, it's just a job!
I think you would have to clean a whole lot of apartments to go all the way to India.
Wow, you ah, you really like all this space stuff, huh?
Yeah. My Dad says if I spend as much time helping him clean apartments, as I do daydreaming about outer space, he'd be able to afford a trip to the Taj Mahal.
No. The one in Atlantic City, Dad loves the slots. He says he's gonna double the college money my Grandma left me.
Huh. Well, good luck to Dad. Say, how many more boxes would you have to sell in order to win?
Look, would you guys grow up? That is the most natural beautiful thing in the world.
What are you guys doing?
We're just hanging out by the spoons. Ladle?
Yeah, we know, but there's a baby suckin' on it.
This is my son having lunch, ok? It's gonna happen a lot, so you'd better get used to it. Now if you have any problem with it, if you're uncomfortable, just ask questions. Carol's fine with it, now come on.
Nono, me neither. Although, uh, y'know, back in college, Susan Sallidor did.
Yeah, I think so, yeah.
Not me.
You're kidding! Did you tell her I wasn't?
No. No, it's just 'cause, uh, I kinda wanted to go out with her too, so I told her, actually, you were seeing Bernie Spellman... who also liked her, so...
Soon he'll be able to call you, that lady he knew who got fired.
Rach, if you have a crush on this guy, why would you hire him? I mean y'know you can't date him right?
Oh no, I know that. I know that. Although, we made a joke that we spend so much time together he should call me his work wife.
I am not gonna get fired, because I'm not gonna act on it.
So you wouldn't mind if he was dating someone else?
I-I-I don't care if I said some other girl's name you prissy, old twit!
But why?! Did he get in touch with Emily?
Well no, not yet. He's calling everyone on her side of the family hoping that someone will help him get in touch with her.
Ross! Way to suck up to the family.
Ha-ha-ha--enh-enh. I'm so glad you guys are all here! My office finally got wrinkle free fax paper!
Oh come on, we just had this huge fight, all right, don't I have to wait a while?
What can I do? One person wants to break-up, you break-up.
Hey, no way! Come on, this is you guys, call her and work it out.
Hey, this isn't like swimming after you eat, pick up the phone!!
Y'know that whole swimming thing is a myth.
Yeah, no, you're right, I know, you're right, I'm not, I'm not gonna do it. All right, thanks guys.
I don't want to do that.
No! You don't want to wreck it, you don't want to go to fast!
Okay, no problem, just remember to wake us up before you go-go.
That's too hard. Too hard!
Uh, everyone, this is Chandler! My roommate and lead singer of our band!
Hey!
Oh my!
Ross!
Oh, this is Monica.
He-he was with me umm, we're playing a little game, y'know? Hide and seek.
Hi! Hi! Hi. Has umm, anyone seen Chandler?
I thought he was with you.
You can't ask us son, that's cheating.
You're right, thanks for keeping me honest dad.
Yeah well if, if, if Mark said that, than Mark's an idiot.
I would never do that!
Look, I know what's going on here, okay, Mark explained it all to me. He said this is what you guys do.
Mark's a genius!
Why?! How?! How is he a genius?
Hey-hey have you ever locked yourself in a TV cabinet VD boy?!
Hey you leave Marcel out of this!
Fine! Have you ever got stuck in a pair of your own leather pants?!
Monkey lover!
When do you think we lost her?
Good! A verbal contract is binding in the state of New York!
And Mon, you wanna live with Chandler, don't ya?
Yes.
So I understand you're looking for a place.
No-no, I'm staying put.
What, he gave you his home number? As in like, to, to his home?
But, you, you don't want to seem too pushy.
Honey, it's not pushy, he gave her his home number.
Yeah, and you don't mind if I call, because you only want good things for me.
That's right good things, that-that is what I said.
No, it's okay. Some-some kid asked me to pick it up for him, but I don't...
Come on!
Oh wait, don't you have to pay for your, Busty Ladies?
Oh yeah? Okay.
Okay.
Look you're my wife. We're-we're married. Y'know? I-I love you. I-I really miss you.
No wait! Look, wait! Okay, you can hang up, but I'm gonna keep calling! I'm gonna, I'm gonna call everyone in England if that's what it takes to get you to talk to me!
Really? About what?
I miss you to. Well, at least I think I do.
She's talking.
Can we please focus here, a naked man's life hangs in the balance!
Rachel has those in burgendy.
All right now remember, something this big and long is going to be difficult to manuver, fortunately I have a lot of experience in that area.
I'm telling you he's dead. What we are about to have here is a dead fat guy on a stick.
All right, ladies and gentlemen, let's poke. Steady. Steady. Okay, a little higher. Careful of the angle. Okay, okay, we're approaching the window Thread the needle. Thread the needle.
You did! Oh.... I always figured you just thought I was Monica's geeky older brother.
Okay. You know you probably didn't know this, but back in high school, I had a, um, major crush on you.
I knew.
I did.
Oh. Listen, do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerability become any kind of a factor here- but do you think it would be okay if I asked you out? Sometime? Maybe?
Hey, y'know what? This is your fault! You're the one that didn't move his-his appointment.
Okay, so it wasn't uh, a traditional massage. But I did give him accu-pressure with a pair of chopsticks. And, and I gently exfoliated him with, with a mop.
Well, he's never coming back! Okay? You just cost me eight dollars a week!
Oh, it's my fault?! You didn't have to massage him! You could've sent him away! You could've not rolled Tonka trucks up and down his back!
He said he liked that!! Oh you're right, you're right. I'm sorry.
Oh, actually I haven't even been home yet. Do you mind if I check my messages?
No, I stayed at Julie's last night.
Huh.
Oh yeah, go ahead.
Rach, I got a message from you. Who's Michael?
Joshua...guy at that club, dancing and having a good time, the thought of it kinda...y'know.
I mean, I, I-I admit I-I wasn't quite there. Y'know, I mean the thought of you and that-that Josh guy...
Joshua.
Yeah, I...
But now! I'm there! I'm totally there! I'm-I'm finally where you are!
O-okay, Rach calm-calm down, okay? She-she's really upset we're just talking.
Hello?
What is my sister doing there?! And why are the drapes shut?!
Ross! I think she is trying to make something happen with you to get back at me!
So that's the only reason she could be here huh? It couldn't have anything to do with the fact that-that maybe I'm a good listener and I uh I put on a great slide show!
Monica, Monica, you could come in straddling him, they still wouldn't believe it. We're here.
Alright, shall we?
OK, wait, wait, wait, wait. You know what? Ross, let's - let's switch places. You get in the middle. No un-, ya know, unless this looks like we're trying to cover something up.
Oh hi kids. Hi darling.
Happy birthday dad.
Okay, Fonzy gives you two thumbs up, collect two cool points. Yeah.
Strip Happy Days Game?
Yeah, well, I couldn't find any cards, so it was either this or Strip Bag Of Old Knitting Stuff.
Monica, if you get five cool points, you get to make somebody take off one item of clothing. It hasn't happened yet, but we're all very excited.
Okay, come on! Daddy needs a new pair of electromagnetic microscopes for the Prehistoric Forensics Department! Okay. Take Pinky Tuscadero up to Inspiration Point, collect three cool points!! Yeah! Which gives me five, and let's see who is gonna lose their clothes. Ummmm, I think I pick our strip poker sponsor Mr. Joey Tribianni.
Sure. By the way, there's a difference between being obsessive and. . .
Oh, gosh, it's hot in here.
Rach, get the heat. Ross, could you turn the heat down please?
Ross, the heat!
Fine, OK! Heat, heat, heat, and I'm the obsessive one. OK, this way is on, so this is. . . off.
Oh yeah? Have you ever dated anyone who has been divorced three times?
No! No, I won't! I'll be at the bottom of the dating barrel now. The only guys below me will be Four Divorce Guy uh, Murderer Guy, and-and, Geologists.
Ross, you're being ridiculous! Okay? You are cute and smart and sweet and that is much more important than three stupid divorces!
Y'know that's really fair. Y'know? Most guys who have been divorced three times are like 60. Ross, nobody cares about this except you! This-this embarrassment thing is all in your head! Here, I'll show you! Come here.
What?! Why?
Anyway, if she, if she wasn't in to me, why-why would she ask me out again?
Something could've happened. All right? She-she really dug my slides. And-and she was definitely giving me the vibe.
Right. Was it the, "Please don't show me another picture of a trilobite vibe?"
She asked-asked you out again?
Yeah-uh-huh. Tomorrow night, Valentine's Day, the most romantic day of the year. Who knows what could happen? I might not be shutting my drapes to show her my slides, if you know what I mean.
Yeah! We'd meet, we'd meet total strangers, and hang out with them!
So what if he didn't come! We can still go out and party ourselves!
Oh-no, y'know with Gandolf we'd be out all night!
Well, we could do that!
There's other stuff too.
Really? I've been thinking, this is crazy, I mean don't, don't you think we can work on this?
Hi! It's me.
Hi! Oh, I'm so glad you called.
Hey, what do you want to drink?
Who's that?
Hello, Susan. Good shake. Good shake. So, uh, we're just waiting for...?
How could I forget?
Ross.
Dr. Oberman.
..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he-
Four percent. Okay. I tip more than that when there's a bug in my food.
Oh it's great, it's a role on All My Children, Nick the boxer.
You had to do it, didn't you? You couldn't just leave it alone.
Ross, tonight was about the two of you getting along. Oh, would you just see my chiropractor, already.
Yeah, I'm gonna go to a doctor who went to school in a mini-mall.
You're great. And I-I know someday this will happen for you too. You just hang in there.
All right, I just wanted to check.
Oh, that's sweet.
Uhh, hang in there?
Oh, no, I didn't mean, uh...
Yeah, they print jokes, interviews, hard-hitting journalism. It's not just about the pictures.
Hey, you're not going to believe this. I made up a joke and sent it in to Playboy. They printed it!
I didn't know Playboy prints jokes.
That didn't work on mom, it's not going to work on us.
Here, check it out. It's the first one, too.
The first time! No seriously, imagine if Carol hadn't realized she was a lesbian.
I know what you mean, I've always wondered how different my life would be if-if I'd never gotten divorced.
Which time?
I can't. I keep seeing it the good way.
I'd bet I'd still be doing my kara-tay. Towards the end of our marriage I was doing a lot of kara-tay as a way of releasing the tension from y'know, not doing anything else physical.
He's in! Oh, did you hear that, Marcel? San Diego. San Diego!
We, we come back from our walk and the- the phone was ringing...
...He's in.
You're making a big mistake here. I mean, San Diego's all well and good, but if you give him to me, I'll start him off against a blind rabbit and give you twenty percent of the gains.
Yo- hooo!
You see what men do! Don't tell me men are not nice! This is men!!
What is the worse part?
I can't remember which sister.
Are you insane? I mean Joey, is going to kill you, he's actually going to kill you dead.
Okay! You don't think I thought of that?
Eh, either way I'll pass. I still can't eat those. What's so funny?!
Uhh, those are tacos.
Excuse me Mr. Mexico.
I'm not laughing.
You told her!
Yeah-No-but-but-but-but! We're just gonna go home and take a shower. Now, that's not scary right?
Y'know, okay. You're right. It is huge. So why don't we take it just a little bit at a time? Okay? Umm, forget getting married for a sec; just forget about it. Can you just come home and take a shower?
Well yeah, but then...
Depends on what you mean by we.
The nights are the hardest. But then the day comes! And that's every bit as hard as the night. And then the night comes again...
She is not... She's gay. Oh my God. She is so gay! I can't believe this.
Men. I guy I know.
Well, you might want to tell him it sounds like his wife is gay.
Good day for married people huh?
I'm sorry your husband cheated on you.
I was barefoot. Now tell me, the toilet thing is the only thing you taught him right?
Yeah that! You know I hate practical jokes! They're mean and they're stupid and-and I don't want my son learning them!
Oh, come on! Saran Wrap on the toilet seat, you don't think that's just a little funny?!
Yes.
It's amazing! My headache is completely gone! What are those pills called?
Here she comes. Don't say a word, okay? Just be cool, don't be...y'know you.
All right, let's not jump to any conclusions. All right? There was some sexual chemistry between them.
Come on, it was like cousins having sex up there!
Hey you guys!
Hey!
So, guys, am I crazy, or does Phoebe's mom remind anyone of a cat?
Why can't you use the phone in here?
Well, I'm returning a call from a certain mom at the B-E-A-C-H. I just spelled the wrong word.
Ross, don't start.
Come on, you-you can't tell me you actually believe that-that there's a woman inside that cat!
Come on, you-you can't tell me you actually believe that-that there's a woman inside that cat!
So, guys, am I crazy, or does Phoebe's mom remind anyone of a cat?
Ross, don't start.
I believe it.
No you don't.
This screen is amazing, I mean Dick Van Dyke is practically life-size.
I can't believe two cows made the ultimate sacrifice so you guys could watch TV with your feet up.
Well they were chair-shaped cows. They never would have survived in the wild.
Woah!
Rose Marie really belongs on a smaller screen, doesn't she?
Well, y'know, monogamy can be a, uh, tricky concept. I mean, anthropologically speaking-
Good for you, Joey.
When I'm with a woman, I need to know that I'm going out with more people than she is.
Fine. Fine, alright, now you'll never know.
We're kidding. C'mon, tell us!
Newly appointed head lunch chef who is also in charge of purchasing--
Ok, ok, here is to my sister, the newly-appointed head lunch chef--
Who is also in charge of purchasing.
Who has her own little desk when Roland's not there.
Uh, lunch chef, purchasing, own little desk when Roland's not there. Here's to my little sister--
Well I'm jumping! I have a son! Okay? He won't have a father if-if I die!
Okay. Well, you be careful.
What? No! No Ross! No-no! Stop! I'm not jumping! Okay, look I have an audition tomorrow and I can't go if I break my leg.
Well all right so, it looks like we're even!
Okay. So, this wire is connected to this wire which plugs into here. Okay so, to get the beeping to stop all I have to do... Well done, Pheebs. What do you want from me?!!!!!!!
That's right, Ryder. Wynona Ryder for six. Thank you. Yeah, we have the reservations.
Oh it's Bing, sir. I'm sorry , I was just ah...
No-no, I heard what you said, funny. I like funny. This team is about hard work, but it's also about having fun. Good to have you aboard Bing!
Yes!!
All right buddy, way to go!
Listen. Oh hey, hey, the important thing was that she meant, she meant nothing to me!
I'm sorry, okay, I'm sorry. I wa-I was disgusted with myself, and this morning I was so, I was so upset and then I got your message and I was so happy, and all I wanted was to get her out of my apartment as fast as possible.
Whoa!! Whoa, whoa, wait a minute. What time did your little friend leave? Oh my God. She was there? She was still there? She was in there, when I was in there?!
And yet she was worth jeopardising our relationship!!
Look, I didn't think there was a relationship to jeopardise. I thought we were broken up.
So they ah, they all took off, it was pretty hard watching them go, y'know?
Okay.
Okay, bye!!
Yeah, okay, bye.
So I'm gonna take off then!
OK, ahem, hey, does anybody know a good place if you're not dating a puma?
Hey guys, does anybody know a good date place in the neighborhood?
How about Tony's? If you can finish a 32-ounce steak, it's free.
Who are you going out with?
Oh, is this the bug lady?
I mean you're not gonna give me a-a ticket for driving too slow are ya?
Ah no. I don't, but it could not have been more than sixty.
You're right. It was 37.
That's right.
Y'know of-officer I uh...I had the weirdest dream last night...
I'm not freaking out, I'm just saying, if somebody had come to me with the idea andndash;
I tell you one thing, I wouldn't mind having a piece of this sun-dried tomato business. Five years ago, if somebody had said to me, here's a tomato that looks like a prune, I'd say "get out of my office!"
Dad, before I was born, did you freak out at all?
Dad, dad, dad, I'm talkin' about the whole uh, baby thing. Did you uh, ever get this sort of... panicky, "Oh my god I'm gonna be a father" kind of a thing?
No. Your mother really did the work. I was busy with the business. I wasn't around that much. Is that what this is about?
Yeah, laugh all you want but in ten minutes we're gonna have younger looking skin!
All right? What's going on?
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I-I should probably leave you girls alone.
Yeah! Y'know, she could use a little... Oh nice shot!!!
Hey! You guys! You're not gonna believe this! I just got off the phone with my agent...
My nana used to do it. That's how she paid for all my dance-karate lessons.
Uh-hmm.
How do you know about this?
Dance karate?
Yes, it's a deadly but beautiful sport.
And shame on you! You should know better, Joey needs to work. Now come on!
This is helping your career?! Huh? I thought you wanted to be an actor not the creator of crazy lawsuit game!
You're right, you're right, I'll get back to work.
Hey!
No! Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah! You can have this back when the five pages are done! Ahh!
Oh, oh, we did say we'd stop by this little thing Joey's roommate is having.
See ya!
Whoa whoa whoa! Where're you goin'?
Oh, Janine, the really hot dancer girl?
Some would say she's attractive, yes.
Actually it's the movie theatre that has the time schedule. So you don't miss the beginning.
No?
No, why do we always have to do everything according to your time table?
No, see this isn't about the movie theatre, this is about you stealing my wind.
You go girl. I can't pull that off can I?
It-it-The point is my natural charisma has made him fail his midterm.
Yeah! I don't know. I mean, last year Elizabeth now-now this kid. What-what-what-what is it?! Am I giving out some kind of...sexy professor vibe?
Not right now.
Oh, see now I feel bad for the kid! I had a crush on a teacher once and it was so hard! Y'know you-I couldn't concentrate and I blushed every time he looked at me. I mean come on, you remember what's it's like to be 19 and in love.
Yeah. I guess I can cut him some slack.
Well, well I am married. Even though I haven't spoken to my wife since the wedding.
Why are you laughing?
Because , because, I just heard it. I heard it, and it's ridiculous! I mean, you're married. You're-you're married and it's just ridiculous, and it's like, it's like when said it, I sort of like, I floated up out of my body, y'know? And, and-and then I heard myself say it and then the floating Rachel was like, "You are such an idiot!"
I'm sorry, that's not funny.
Actually, it kinda is. My wife won't return my calls. I don't know where my wife is. "Hey Ross, where's the Mrs.?" Don't know!
All right, I gotta take off. I'm picking up Ben then we're off to the big audition.
Dude! That's my girlfriend!
What, so I gotta shut it down now?
It's gonna be weird to watch some actor pretending to be Ben's dad.
Yeah.
Okay, maybe it wasn't my best decision. But I just couldn't face another failed marriage.
Oh my God!!
Ross!
Okay, let me just jump in and ask, at what point did you think this was a successful marriage?
Rach, come on, if you think about it, it's actually kinda funny. Okay, maybe it's best not to think about it.
Go ahead, go ahead with the bird. Ok, do you have anything for around 200?
Dollars? You spent $1200 dollars on a plastic bird?
Uhhh, I was an impulse buyer, near the register.
Uh, the dog.
Huh.
You know, that Steffi Graf has quite a tush. I'm just saying, it's right there.
You know what the. . .
I am here, on my knees, holding up these couch cushions as a symbol of my sorrow and regret, much like they did in biblical times. Though you may haveth anger now. . .
Hey guys.
Hi, darling. Where's my grandson, you didn't bring him?
No, no, wait, ok, ok, look at the other side. Look at Julie's column.
No, that, that was, I mean, as opposed to uh, the uh, ok. Is this over yet Rach?
Oh! I do not have chubby ankles!
She is not Rachem. What the hell's a Rachem? Is that some stupid paleontology word that I wouldn't know because I'm just a waitress.
No, Rach, come on. Rach! Rach, no, no! She's not Rachel, she is, she is not, Ra--Rachel?
Okay, we'll be right in. So ah, did your boss try to slap you again today?
Ahh, the one next to my foot. Sorry.
Hey, the fight's starting!
Nine times! Okay, I had to put on lotion! But, it's gonna be okay, because as of tomorrow I'm conducting an experiment, and if all goes as planned, my butt will be smack free.
Fight's over!
Ooh. What is the name of Chandler's father's Las Vegas all-male burlesque?
You don't have to shout everything.
I'm sorry!
Viva Las Gaygas!
Unfortunately that is correct.
Well, Kathy gets half-naked and simulates sex with a real good lookin' guy.
Hey!
Ooh! How was Kathy's play?
Yeah, it's like someone literally wrote down my worst nightmare and then charged me $32 to see it!
That's a good idea for a business!
What?! Are you insane? This woman stole from you. She stole. She's a stealer.
Nope. We took her to lunch.
Ah. Your own brand of vigilante justice.
Y'know what? After you're with this woman for like ten minutes, you forget all that. I mean, she is this astounding person, with this, with this amazing spirit.
Yeah, which she probably stole from some cheerleader.
You're right. That's very different. So let's, let's just sign the papers. All right? What?
Hey! Wait a minute! That was different! I did those things because I was in love with you!
Yeah! Right!
Nothing.
Okay, can we just sign please?
Look, I don't have to answer your questions! Okay? I'm a big boy, I can do whatever I want!
You walked around all night in the city by yourself?
He hooked up! He hooked up with someone.
He hooked up!! Tell us about her!
Ross you left you scarf in... Hey you guys.
I like this one. It seems to say, "I love you and that's why I have to kill you."
Aww!
That's it! Take it! Take it! Take it!
They can't all be bad. Find the one where you make your bedroom eyes. Ohh, there it is.
Oh my God! Those are my bedroom eyes?! Why did you ever sleep with me?
Uh, so this play umm, what do you think? It's-it's gotten great reviews! Y'know the uh...
No! Okay! Okay! Okay, look, can I, can I just-just talk to you for a second?
Yeah, sure.
Attack!
Put your balloons down!
Okay! Okay! Ooh-hey-hey-hey! Okay! Okay! Okay! I'll-I'll tell her tonight I can't see her anymore.
I mean after tomorrow night.
No-no-no! No-no-no! Please Ross, I can't! I can't do it! It's just gonna freak me out!!!
Ross thanks.
You want me to call her right now?
Um-hmm. I have a condition, apparently, that I require two different sets of focals.
Mine.
You wear bi-focals?
Did you know my husband has glasses just like that?
Well those are very popular frames.
Plus tip, divided by six. Ok, everyone owes 28 bucks.
Anything else?
Yes, how 'bout a verse of Killing Me Softly. You're gonna sneeze on my fish, aren't you?
Um, everyone?
Oh, you're right, I'm sorry.
Yeah... I guess. I don'tI don't know. Alright, just... just give her this for me, OK?
He's right, man. Please. Move on. Go to China. Eat Chinese food.
Course there, they just call it food.
Listen, buddy, we're just looking out for you.
I know.
Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs!
Ooh, she should not be wearing those pants.
I say push her down the stairs.
C'mon Daddy, listen to me! It's like, it's like, all of my life, everyone has always told me, 'You're a shoe! You're a shoe, you're a shoe, you're a shoe!'. And today I just stopped and I said, 'What if I don't wanna be a shoe? What if I wanna be a- a purse, y'know? Or a- or a hat! No, I'm not saying I want you to buy me a hat, I'm saying I am a ha- It's a metaphor, Daddy!
You can see where he'd have trouble.
Susan wanted a Chunky. We're having a baby, ok, a baby, you don't stop for Chunkys.
We stopped at the gift shop.
I was looking at stuffed animals, and Susan wanted a Chunky.
I used to have that bumper sticker.
You see what I mean.
At least I know she's not going out with me to get into R rated movies.
I mean y'know, I'm thinking. You could bring her, and you guys could go up to your old room, and not make out.
Ross, cough drops, please?
Why don't you just marry her? Oh no, wait a minute you can't, I'm sorry I forgot, she's not a lesbian.
You see Amanda and I have a very special...
Pheebs, if you don't tell him, soon he's gonna be married, and then you're gonna hate yourself.
Well, have-have you told him how you feel?
Yes. Not out loud.
Yeah, but if I do tell him, then he's gonna hate myself. I mean look at him and his Mom, I can't. But, you guys can, please you gotta talk him out of it.
No-no-no-no-no.
Hey, y'know while we're on that, when are you gonna tell my sister that you don't live here anymore.
Oh, then it must've been you. Bye.
Bye-bye! That's why I moved out.
I think on some levels she already knows.
Phoebe, she doesn't know that you sneak out every night, she doesn't know that you sneak back every morning, and she doesn't know that you've been living with your Grandmother's for a week now.
No. So, um, let's see your pretty close, huh. Make-up's on, hair's done.
'Cause, I'm a stupid, stupid man.
Hey, Ross, want some cider?
Yeah, I just have to get dressed.
Yay! And that takes what? Just six or seven minutes.
Okay. Wow, it's-it's 5:30 in the morning. So, I'd better get cracking on this baby.
Ohh! Thank you! I like mail.
It's just some things I've been thinking about. Some things about us, and before we can even think about the two of us getting back together, I just need to know how you feel about this stuff.
Well, I'll be waiting for you, just come up when you're done.
Okay, I'll be up in, 18 pages. Front and back. Very exciting.
Oh, you uh, you wanna hear a freaky coincidence? Guess who's doing laundry there too?
So, uh, Rachel, what are you, uh, what're you doing tonight?
Oh, big glamour night. Me and Monica at Laundorama.
Who?
Me. Was that not clear? Hey, why don't, um, why don't I just join you both, here?
Of course I was mad! I told you I-I hate this stuff! Okay? It-it's not funny!
Wh-wh-what line? The line that prompted a student in my last class of the day to say uh, "Dude, don't you ever was your face?"
All right, I'm sorry. I'm sorry I didn't tell you but you were so mad already!
Hey Ross!
Hi.
Yeah, yeah. Y'know, now that you kicked the sign, hey! I don't miss Marcel any more!
Oh come on. It's cold, it's dark, he doesn't know the Village. And now I have a broken foot. I have no monkey, and a broken foot! Thank you very much.
Ross, I said I'm sorry like a million times. What do you want me to do? You want me to break my foot too? Okay, I'm gonna break my foot, right here. Ow!! Oh! Oh my God, oh my God! There, are you happy now?!
Y'know, it is not like I did this on purpose.
Oh, no no no. Nono, this is just vintage Rachel. I mean, things just sort of happen around you. I mean, you're off in Rachel-land, doing your Rachel-thing, totally oblivious to people's monkeys, or to people's feelings...
Oh, wait! Wait! Don't you have an audition today? Yeah! Maybe you'll get that job!
Well isn't there something you can do to earn a little extra money? I mean, can't-can't you pick up, I don't know, an extra shift here?
Or, y'know, I used to beg for money. Of course it helps if you've got y'know a little of this goin' on. Wow! I still have it!
Oh, ha-ha-ha! Ooh! Wait a minute, I used to get medical experiments down on me all the time!
Ah, finally an explanation.
I bet if I talk to Carol and Susan I can convince them to move to London with Ben.
But you live here! You know that.
What-what-what are you gonna do?
Yeah, I'm sure your ex-wife will be more than happy to move to another country so you can patch things up with your new wife.
It could happen.
...can't, can't a guy send a barbershop quartet to his girlfriend's office anymorrrrre!!
I mean my God...
You're hurt!
Oh, please, Ross it was so obvious! It was like you were marking your territory. I mean you might have well have just come in and peed all around my desk!
I would never do that!
Oh, I uh, just came by to pick up my skull. Well, not mine, but...Susan: Come in.
Hi, is uh, is Carol here?
No, she's at a faculty meeting.
Thanks. Yeah, Carol borrowed it for a class, and I have to get it back to the museum.
What's it look like?
Okay! Ho-ho! We did not steal your thunder because we are not getting back together!
What?!
See yeah umm, you kinda stole my thunder!
Yeah. No. And you know what? Nobody even saw!
Yeah!
Y'know what? It sounds so weird to say this but, I just had a great day with Janice!
Hey!
Yeah!
What?!
Are you serious?!
Oh, great. Great. There was a projectile, uh, throwing up incident, but he started it.
Ok. Here's his diaper bag, and his uh, Mr. Winky, and uh...oh, him. Hi!
So how did everything go?
Well, we've gotta go.
Ok.
No, God no! That is no place for a woman. Those guys will grab anything.
I don't care! I am not quitting! I insist on finishing this game!
All right, all right, if you insist on doing this, at least let me help you.
No. That's not what I'm saying. I just may know a few things that might help you inflict some pain.
I like that.
Ok, and then you take the poopie diaper and you put it in the poopie diaper pail.
What're you talkin' about, I was killin' 'em.
Yeah, well they suck too.
Ok Ross, just so you know, calling it a poopie diaper doesn't make this process any cuter.
Hello.
Uh-huh. Hey, here you go buddy. Sorry, no porn for you. Okay, let's go see Monica!
Okay.
But! Don't you have to give him his money back?
So Monica, still going out with Dr. Boring huh?
He's not boring! He's just-he's just low key.
The gas is odorless, but they add the smell so you know when there's a leak.
They put that in.
What?!
Well okay!
A lot of other gas smells...
Yeah. Tell ya what, let's not invite any of the anthropologists, only the dinosaur dudes!
I'll be there.
All right-oh! Listen, I know this is your party, but I'd really like to the number of museum geeks that are gonna be there.
Okay! We'll need a six-pack of Zima.
Hey guys, what are you doing?
So honey this uh, this threesome thing umm, I mean how-how are you gonna start to find...
Oh Drake.
Okay! Here we go! Okay! Hi, Joey! It's Rachel! Umm, I am free tomorrow night. Yeah, sure, sure I can bring some sandwiches.
Ooh, actually I've been making a list of all the women I know who might be into doing this!
Oh. Wow! Huh. Boy! Well, someone's been doing their homework.
Umm, I'm sorry Judy, I couldn't find that bowl that you and Jack were looking for.
I think his begging days are over now that he's going out with Nancy Branson.
Y'know what? I've just had it with high school boys! They are just silly. Silly, stupid boys! I'm going to start dating men!
Call them mom and dad you loser!
Monica!
Oh, oh. Oh, oh. Oh this is it. Oh my god it's baby time. Baby time.
A-ha!
Would you let it go Ross. It was just a dream. It doesn't mean...
All right, relax, relax. Just relax, just relax. Be cool, be cool.
Yeah, hi, I was just beeped. No, Andr is not here. Third time today. Yes, I'm sure... No, sir. I don't perform those kind of services.
Monica's right. We're talking about getting married here. Okay? She-she can't just rush into this.
Yes, but this is Pete. Okay? He's not like other people, on your first date he took you to Rome. For most guys that's like a third or fourth date kinda thing.
Well if-if that's what it is, then it's-it's crazy.
Oh please, what do you know! You married a lesbian!
All right. I gotta go. I have break up with Vince.
Look, were down to just one point. Could we please, maybe just settle it after the wedding.
My god!! You must have been a teenage when you had him.
There's no way in hell, I'm paying for it.
All-right fine, but I just want to say, I'm not paying for your wine cellar. You thieving, would be speaking German if it weren't for us, cheap little man.
The guy was hammered, okay? There's no way, you look like Ross's mother.
I know where Joey would be. He would be down in the foxhole protecting all of us.
Man, I would be great in a war! I mean, I really, I think I would make a fantastic military leader. I mean I know I would make General way before any of you guys.
Before or after you were shot by your own troops?
Yes, if the foxhole was lined with sandwiches.
Yeah, hero sandwiches.
C'mon, you'll make a day of it! You'll rent a boat, pack a lunch...
I wanna be buried at sea, it looks like fun.
Define fun.
...And then we throw your body in the water... Gee, that does sound fun.
Everyone thinks they know me. Everyone says 'Jack Geller, so predictable'. Maybe after I'm gone, they'll say 'Buried at sea! Huh!'.
Now, I know you wanted to bond with my dad, but did you really have to bond to that part?
Come on, it's not that big a deal!
Not that big a deal? There...there was touching of things.
Listen, I'm sure that dad doesn't care. He probably thought this was funny; he'll be telling this story for years!
I don't want him to tell this story for years.
I know. I know. But, can we please try it again? Huh? I mean, you were so close Phoebe!
Look, I-I'm really sorry I let go of the bike.
I could've been killed I hope you know!
Well, I would love to but...the bike got stolen and the police have no suspects.
Phoebe.
Well, aren't you forgetin' something? What, what, what is uh, what is that guy's name? Dad!
Are you serious?
Yeah. The great thing about the jam plan was, I was taking control of my life. So I asked myself, what is the most important thing to me in the world and that's when I came up with the baby plan.
It took me 28 years to find one man that I wanna spend my life with, if I have to wait another 28 years then, I'll be 56 before I can have a baby, and that's just stupid.
That, that's what's stupid.
Your Mom, your telling me, your telling me, about your Mom, what is the matter with you?
With the belly-button ring? Oh, muhawa!
I know, And then all of the sudden your Mom pops into your head. And your like 'Mom, get outta here!' You know, but of course, like, after that you can't possibly think of anything else, and you can't, you know, stop what your doing. So it's kinda like, you're, you know. You know.... You don't know!
You said...
I said 'share' not 'scare'. Go sit over there! .
Yeah, well it came to about $112, but what the hell, just call it an even 110?
Oh, great! Listen, oh I had to get you a whole new battery. I got you the best one I could, 'cause that's not where you want to skimp.
You're a genius, Ross.
Okay, I'll pay you tomorrow.
Okay.
I'll do it. Hey, whatever you need me to do, I'm your man. Whoa-oh-whoa! Are you, are you okay?
Hey!
Look-look-look you guys, I need some help! Okay? Someone is going to have to convince my hand twin to cooperate!
Yeah! I'm fine! Thanks! Hey Rach, how you doin'?
I'm doin' good, baby. How you doin'?
Then don't. Stay here. Just don't go so soon to London, just one more day.
Yeah?
I wish I didn't have to go.
Ohh, Ross, please!
One more day, seriously/
Oh yeah! So ah, kinda pretty, pretty good. He sounds like a nice, good guy.
Yeah. So um, I-I heard about this ah, Mark guy that ah, Rachel met today.
Isn't that great?
Oh, he is. And he is so dreamy. I mean, y'know what, when he left I actually used the phrase, 'Hummina-hummina-hummina.'
That's excellent.
Well, I do, so let's... So, Ben, you uh, you know what holiday is coming up, don't ya?
Wooooooo, hehehe. Hey, ahh, you don't feel like you're gonna throw up, do ya?
No.
Christmas.
Yep, and you know what other holiday is coming up?
Believe me, it seems like less because they hid it from us for so long.
I can't believe they've been together for three years.
Has it been that long?!
Hey, it's me! I'm comin' in!
I've had a very long, hard day.
So honey, this morning was fun, huh? Me hopping in on you in the shower there.
Okay look, Chandler, if this you have got to listen! You're gonna throw that juice at me, aren't ya?
It's not all juice!
Yeah! And maybe someday we could get a place with two bathrooms.
Look Carol umm, I was, I was thinking maybe uh, maybe we can spice things up a little.
Okay, now just remember everything I taught you and you'll be fine. Okay? Here we go. Ready...Set...
Is that why you became a chef? So that people would like you?
Oh, you really want to talk about getting people to like you huh, funny man?
Wait! This seat is really uncomfortable! Yeah, maybe before we start we should just get another one. Perhaps, like an airplane seat-or a beanbag chair!
Phoebe, you can't get out of this! Okay? You have to learn how to ride a bike!
Well that stinks. I was looking forward to us wearing our celebrity tuxes together.
I would but mine doesn't fit. The pants are a little tight.
A little tight? I could see double-oh and seven in those pants.
Well, does that mean that you're not going to wearing yours?
What are you kidding? It's Batman's tux!!
The uh, the baby that hasn't been born yet? Wouldn't that mean you're... crazy?
Hey, hey, Yertle the Turtle. A classic.
Actually, I'm reading it to the baby.
What, you don't think they can hear sounds in there?
You're not serious, I mean, you really... you really talk to it?
OK, what's the longest you've been in the relationship before ha, have, having the sex?
Naa.
What? C'mon, talk to me.
Why? Who's not having. . . Are you and Julie not, are, are you and, are you and Julie not having sex?
Technically, huh, no.
What-what are you doing?! Are you-Okay that's not funny! Just stop horsing around!
You don't have a valid driver's license-Okay that is it! Pull over right now!
Oh Ross you're so tense! You just gotta relax okay? Just need to relax all right? Just need to relax...
I am not horsing around okay? I am Porsching around.
Uh-oh.
Hold on a second, alright? Just think about what you went through the last time you quit.
Oh, I can't believe you! You've been so good, for three years!
And this- is my reward!
Okay, so this time I won't quit!
Ohhh! Put it out!
Oh no, you-you don't understand. Ugh, this is so silly. Umm, this is all because of a sandwich.
Yeah.
We want you to speak to a psychiatrist.
A sandwich?
Yeah. You see my-my sister makes these amazing turkey sandwiches. Her secret is, she puts a, an extra slice of gravy soaked bread in the middle; I call it the Moist Maker. Anyway, I-I put my sandwich in the fridge over here...
Ah, the heart of every healthy relationship. Honesty, respect, and sex with celebrities.
Her what?
Well, we have a deal, where we each get to pick five celebrities that we can sleep with, and the other one can't get mad.
So, Chandler, who's on your list?
Ah, Kim Basinger, Cindy Crawford, Halle Berry, Yasmine Bleeth, and ah, Jessica Rabbit.
I'm really gonna miss this apartment. Y'know, Ben-Ben took his first steps right over there.
No-no, this is my collection of fossil samples.
So, rocks.
Ohh. Hey, remember when I ran into this thing and it kinda knocked me out a little?
I loved this place! To tell you the truth, I wish I didn't have to move.
I'm Ross Geller. Wha, I'm, God in your add you said you were pretty but wow.
Look at that, look at that, see how she's pushing him away and he won't budge. Alright, I'm gonna do something. Excuse me, are you Rachel?
What?
What are you, what are you doin'?
Oh, oh my God, is this the wrong day? I don't believe it, uh, well, hey, I guess if it works out we'll, we'll have something to tell the grandkids.
Look, you can't do this Mon. All right, if you do this, I'm, I'm gonna, I'm, I'm gonna.....
Okay, sperm donor number 03815, come on down! Okay, he's 6'2", 170 pounds, and he describes himself as a male Geena Davis.
You mean there's more than one of us.
You're gonna what?
I'm gonna tell Mom.
Okay, now hold on. Joey, why, why can't you just wear the underwear you're wearing now?
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Come on, come on, what. You took his underwear?
He took my essence!
Because, I'm not wearing any underwear now.
Okay, then why do you have to wear underwear tonight?
Well, we won't wanna raise kids in the city so we'll probably move to uh, Scarsdale.
Yeah. Ya know, a boy and a girl. Hopefully the girl will come first so Ben here won't feel too competitive.
Then what's gonna happen?
Uh-huh.
Yeah, that way I figure, ya know, we'll be far enough away from our parents that we don't have to see them all the time but close enough that they can come over and babysit whenever we want. And yes, I know, the taxes are a little higher than, let's say, Nassau county but the school system's supposedly great.
Well I, close your eyes, I just think you're gonna like this a little better, 'cause, close-close...
No. No, y'know you don't, you don't wear enough of this. What?
Since when, since when do you think I don't wear enough of this?
Blow it.
Sorry. 'Cause umm, I think this will make you a little more sophisticated.
Y'know what? Actually I'm kinda glad they're leaving 'cause uh, I need to talk to you about something.
Ah. Joey you're-you're having lunch with my mom?
No, I-I just heard lunch. But yeah, I can go. Sure!
What's up?
Well this uh, this may be a little awkward.
All right Emily, as much as I love you, I'm sorry, I can't move to London without Ben.
Well, y'know I-I-I think I'm gonna respect the privacy of my new secret boyfriend.
Why?! I mean if this guy was me and it was me who had learned that it was me who was the best you'd ever had, I'd be going like this.
I understand that would be difficult.
Yeah, would you please consider moving here? I mean you were gonna move here anyway, why can't you just do that?
Not at all! I love this guy. Hey, I was so psyched to hear you're back with my sister!
Hey, Fun Bobby!
Hey. Whoa, hey, you've been working out, huh?
You and me both.
Hey, so what'd I miss, what'd I miss, c'mon?
Y'know how-how the nurse said that-that Nana had passed? Well, she's not, quite..
Ross!
What is going on?!
What?
She's not- past, she's present, she's back.
Sweetie, it's be gonna okay, all right. It's a wedding, generally people focus on the bride.
Are you all right?
Yeah, when I was in the bathroom I saw the window that I crawled out of at my wedding, and God, I just started thinking that I shouldn't be here, you know I shouldn't, people are going to be looking at me and judging me and, and thinking about the last time.
God I know, you're right.
All rightie, everybody look at me. Good. All right, its time. Bridesmaids and ushers let's see two lines, thank you.
Yes. Yes. Don't worry. Everything's fine. We'll uh, we'll see you tomorrow at the wedding.
Oh damn!
He's getting married tomorrow right?
I wasn't invited.
Well then we'll-we'll see you the day after tomorrow. Mom?! Dad?! What-what...what you guys doing here?!
Wha? No no! Ah! All gone! So good! Maybe Chandler has some left.
I'm gonna go into the bathroom so I can look at it in the mirror, as I eat it.
Okay, now what was that all about? Is it-does it not taste good? Let me try it.
It tastes like feet!
I like it.
What's all this about you guys fighting?! Is this really over a room?! I mean, that is so silly!
Yeah, I feel kinda bad for them, but I'm also really psyched 'cause I don't have to move in here!
Oh no, yeah no, that part's great!
Ross, we can handle this.
Well, apparently not, and I can't just stand by and watch two people I care about very much be hurt over something that is so silly. I mean, enough of the silliness!
I didn't know what I was taking full responsibility for! Okay?! I didn't finish the whole letter!
And for the record, it took two people to break up this relationship!!
Yeah! You and that girl from that copy place, which yesterday you took full responsibility for!!
What?!!
I fell asleep!
Rach. OK, forget, forget the lobsters OK. We're, let's talk, what about us?
No no, you're uh, you're my lobster. See um, lobsters, uhh, in the tank when, when they're old, uhh, they get with, uhh, they walk around holding the claws. In the tank, ya know, with, with the holding and. . . Uhh, Phoebs you wanna help me out with the, the whole lobster thing?
Do the claws again.
Ross, there is no us, OK.
No, but. . .
Wow! I'm honored! And y'know what I'm gonna do as my first act as your best friend?
Oh, who? Me?
Yeah!
What?
I'm gonna get you to talk to Chandler.
'I am Bea. I drink tea. Won't you dance around with....' Ohhh!
Won't you dance around with me.
A-ha!!!
Ross!!!
Hey!
No... No... No. I think I should stay, I think we should both know whats going on.
Hi. Sorry Im late. Wheres, wheres Carol?
Stuck at school. Some parent-teacher thing. You can go. I'll get the information.
Oh, good. Thisll be fun.
Alrighty. Were gonna start with some basic third stage breathing exercises, so Mummies, why dont you get on your back? And... coaches, you should be supporting Mummys head.
But hey, it's not just me, I mean the scientists and the tour guides never sit together.
Hey, uh, I'm really, really sorry about what happened in the cafeteria today.
It's no big deal. Hey, y'know, you do what you gotta do. Right?
Whatever.
It's like that everywhere, Joey! Okay, Mon, back me up here. Where you work the uh, waiters eat with the waiters, right? And the chefs eat with the other chefs, right?
What, so he was a little analytical. That's what he does, y'know? C'mon, he's not that bad.
Yeah.
Oh, it's nothing, it's a little thing... I hate that guy.
Y'see, that's where you're wrong. Why would I marry her if I thought on any level thatthat she was a lesbian?
I dunno. Maybe you wanted your marriage to fail.
Okay! Okay! Okay! It's okay. It's okay. Hey, it's too weird for you, I won't see her again.
Yeah-uh-huh. Tomorrow night, Valentine's Day, the most romantic day of the year. Who knows what could happen? I might not be shutting my drapes to show her my slides, if you know what I mean.
Okay-okay-okay-okay-okay-okay-okay! I got it! I got it! I got it! I can't! I can't! I can't! I cannot go with you and my sister thing. Okay? I just can't. It's just too weird, all right? I imagine the two of you together and I freak out. It freaks me out. I can't do it! I can't do it.
Thank you. I...yeah.
I mean after tomorrow night.
Well, I am going to, uh... get a beverage. It was nice, nice... uh... meeting you.
Periodontist.
See? They're as different as night and... later that night.
Ditto.
I, uh, well... I... I met Russ.
Mon, speaking of which, dad says he knows someone you can call for an interview.
'Cause I was going by it the other day and I saw that there was a stock with my initials, MEG, on it and, well, sometimes I have to watch for two or three hours before it comes up again but when it does, it's pretty exciting.
Ok honey, you really need a job.
Really.
Ok, right there. That, that's the third sign today. Right there.
Yeah and he didn't really ask for you, he asked for Chancy, I assumed he meant you.
My dad wanted to know if you wanted to play racquetball with us.
Wow! That's great! Dad must really like you, he doesn't ask just anyone to play.
Well, did-did you correct him?
No, I-I thought it would be more fun this way.
Emily? Emily! Oh my God! Oh my God, it's Emily! It's Emily everyone! Shush-shush-shhst! Hi!
Hello.
Hello, Ross?
Ross, I'm only ringing to say stop harassing my relatives. Good-bye!
No wait! Look, wait! Okay, you can hang up, but I'm gonna keep calling! I'm gonna, I'm gonna call everyone in England if that's what it takes to get you to talk to me!
Oh my God. Ohh, my little sister and my best friend...shaking up. Oh, that's great. That's great.
What's up?
Well umm, Chandler and I are moving in together.
Guys, I'm happy too.
Okay, come here!
Look Carol umm, I was, I was thinking maybe uh, maybe we can spice things up a little.
So honey, this morning was fun, huh? Me hopping in on you in the shower there.
Yeah! And maybe someday we could get a place with two bathrooms.
What do you mean?
Carol our sex life is-it's just not working...
Oh, uh, can it wait a second Joey? I have to tell my parents something. No it can't? Okay.
Okay, fine!
Ross! Can I talk to you for a second?
Okay, look, I think we have to tell Rachel she messed up her dessert.
What?! What is with everybody? It's Thanksgiving, not...Truth-Day!
I love you too! I'm, I'm gonna call you right now from the phone booth! You can't hear me.
I uh, I've been to his apartment and he wasn't there, and uh. I need to talk to him, so do you have any idea where he is?
Ross, are you there? Ross, I don't know if you can hear this but... I'm gonna talk anyway, uh, I'm in the States with you sister and your friends and it's all over with Colin. I came here to tell you that, and to tell you-Yes, Joey you can have all the chocolate you want, just take it! Uh, I came here to tell you that I love you.
I wish I could know if you'd heard any of that. I suppose I've either just told you I love you or given my neighbours a good laugh. Mrs. Newman if you're listening, bugger off this in none of your business. I suppose there's not much chance you did heard that, and there's the call waiting so, I should go. Oh well. Hello.
Hi.
Mine stole my newspaper! It's like a crime wave!! Pheebs, you uh, you got a second.
Hey Mon, you might wanna make some more lasagna too, because something might've happened to a huge chunk of it.
Ross! The neighbors ate all my candy!!
Sure!
Yeah, ever since you uh, told me that story about that bike I-I couldn't stop thinking about it. I mean, everyone should have a-a first bike, so...
Anyway it-it kinda-it all boils down to this, the last time I talked to Emily...
You don't know how long we're gonna be in here! We may have to repopulate the Earth.
And condoms are the way to do that?
Oh my God! My dog died!
What?!
Okay, okay, yes, it is. How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age.
No. No.
Yes, it is. Carol! Hi!
Hi.
So.
You see this, this is a person who is ready to go. Phoebe you, oh, you are my star.
Wow, hello! You look great!
Thank you! I know, though.
Ohh, well, you're my lucky penny.
All right, I took the quiz, and it turns out, I do put career before men. Get up.
No. Rachel hooked me up with a tux! But not just any tux, Batman's tux!
Hey! Guess what I got for your wedding!
A freakish thin date with a hanger for her head?
What?
That's right! Made expressly for Val Kilmer and worn by him in the hit film...that Batman film he was in.
That, that is funny. That is painfully funny. No, wait. Wait, yeah, that's just painful
Hi.
Hey, oh, so, um...how'd you make out last night?
Wait a minute. I thought last night was great.
Yeah, it was, but...I get home, ok, and I see Julie's saline solution on my night table. And I'm thinking to myself, oh my god, what the hell am I doing? I mean, here I am, I am with Julie, this incredible, great woman, who I care about and who cares about me, and I'm like, what, am I just gonna throw all that away?
That's okay, I mean it was just two-week thing anyway, I just didn't want it to end this way, y'know?
Yeah, have a seat.
I'm so sorry.
Well, maybe you didn't want it to end?
What do you mean?
Yes, yes it is. It's uh... Every time on the lips! Why?! Why on lips?!
Oh, hey Aunt Millie.
Isn't it a beautiful wedding?!
Here's Frannie. Hmm, won't she be happy to see me?
Now wait a minute, you be nice! All right? I didn't bring you here so you can ambush her.
Where's my ring? My dead grandmother's wedding ring? Where is it? Where is it?
You be cool.
Okay, which one of you guys is Gunther Central-Perk? Hey, Joey?
Way to be cool, man.
What's he talking about?
Yeah, it kinda grows on you. Actually, I wanted to finish talking to you about uh, spring vacation.
Oo-oo!
Doorknob?
Oh good.
Look, I... Look, I'm having a great time with you and I just don't want us to move to fast or put to much pressure on us. So, I'm sorry I just don't think we should go away together yet. It's-it's too soon.
No-no, I got the edge. I know it's not exactly ethical but I sent him a little bribe to
Well, I called over there and it turns out Ugly Naked Guy is subletting it himself and he's already had like a hundred applicants.
Oh.
Oh, is it that pinball machine with the big bow on it?
No.
No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem a little angry?
Yeah, well, word of advice: Bring back the comedian. Otherwise next time you're gonna find yourself sitting at home, listening to that album alone.
....Are we still talking about sex?
Well, she has issues.
Does she.
I know, I know I really like you too. But we-we can't date. It's against the rules. It's forbidden.
Wow! It actually is in the handbook. I can't date you or have a hot plate in my office. I can't believe we have to stop seeing each other.
For what it's worth I did appreciate you standing up for me. It felt really nice. It kinda made me like you even more.
Wow!
What?
Well, I don't think we are gonna have that problem, but maybe that's just because I am not emotionally unavailable!
Listen, you are hearing one side of the story, okay-and F.Y.I she must've shown Kyle over 30 paint samples before she painted that room! And his response to each one was, "I don't give a tiny rat's ass."
Yeah well, maybe she should've spent a little less time decorating and a little more time in the bedroom.
You think he's emotionally unavailable?
I think he can be.
Monica and I have a grandmother who died, you both went to her funeral, name that grandmother!
Gentlemen, you're pick.
It's All Relative.
Nana?
She has a real name.
I remember the moonlight coming through the window- and her face had the most incredible glow.
Yeah?
Yeah. I think you have to draw him out. And then- when you do- he's a preppy animal.
Yes, the moon, the glow, the magical feeling, you did this part- Could I get some painkillers over here, please?
He's right, enough, already. What is the big deal about today? So you slept with her for the first time, so what? You slept with her for seven years after that.
Shut up! It was nice. I just... I don't think I'm the dirty-talking kind of guy, you know?
Alright, I panicked, alright? She took me by surprise. You know, but it wasn't a total loss. I mean, we ended up cuddling.
Whoaa!! You cuddled? How many times??
What's the big deal? You just say what you want to do to her. Or what you want her to do to you. Or what you think other people might be doing to each other. I'll tell you what. Just try something on me.
Please be kidding.
Wasn't this supposed to be just a fling, huh? Shouldn't it be... flung by now?
I know...
Ah, it's just a weekend, big deal!
I mean, we are way past the fling thing, I mean, I am feeling things that I've only read about in Danielle Steele books, you know? I mean, when I'm with him, I'm totally, totally...
...nauseous, I'm physically nauseous. What am I supposed to do, huh? Call immigration? I could call immigration!
Wait-wait, so, you get to be my best man twice and I never get to be yours at all?
You can be the best man when I get married.
I'll never get to be a best man!
Oh no-no-no, you-yeah, of course you get to be my best man.
What about me?! You-you just said I could!
I've got to say; I know I divorce a lot of women, never thought I would be divorcing you.
So then if-if-I mean if you think about it, this is all your fault.
Yeah, don't push it though.
I know. I always thought if you and I got married, it would be the one that stuck. And it wouldn't be a secret, and we wouldn't have our wedding dinner at Pizza Hut.
Did I, did I even treat?
No, no don't! Stop cleansing my aura! No, just leave my aura alone, okay?
Thanks.
Ooh! Oh!
Fine! Be murky!
I'll be fine, alright? Really, everyone. I hope she'll be very happy.
Well, hey. You're an actor, I say you just suck it up and do it. Or you just do it.
'Cause he was just so darn cute.
No, as part of the audition. See, I'm up for this part of this guy, who the main guy kisses.
I did do it, I'm a professional.
Then what's the problem?
No, that, that was, I mean, as opposed to uh, the uh, ok. Is this over yet Rach?
Now that's a little spoiled. He was supposed to type "little", the idiot.
Just a waitress?
Oh! I do not have chubby ankles!
No, no, wait, ok, ok, look at the other side. Look at Julie's column.
You should've seen the look on her face. I don't want Rachel to hate me! I don't know what to do.
Chandler stole a twenty from my purse!
Nooooo!!! Y'know what? Now that I think about it, I constantly find myself without twenties and you always have lots!
You want my advice?
Yes! Please!
Rachel, ready or not, here comes your knight in shining. . . oh no.
Let's show 'em.
Uh, just a sec dad. OK, be cool, just be cool. OK dad.
Bye.
Oh, dear. Jack, how do I turn this off?
Rachel says sharing's great and supposedly, you know, we outta be doing it. Do you wanna?
No Chandler, everything! Like stuff you like, stuff she likes, technique, stamina, girth....
Girth? Why, why, why, wh-why, why, why, why would they do this?
We're not gonna talk about girth are we?
Nooo!
Well, I guess I can check out those apartment listings, even though there's never anything in here.
All right. Uhh, international.
Oh that's mine too! I'm Italian!
Not even on page 7?
Oh yeah! You're-hey, you're right! Here's an affordable place, two bedroom, close to work, ooh, it's available in five weeks!
It's no surprise that your winning, 'cause you got to pick first, so you got the better team.
I went really long.
Forty-two to twenty-one! Like the turkey, Ross is done!
You're so pathetic! Why can't you just accept it, we're winning because I'm better than you.
Oh, what a great argument, exhaling! All right, y'know what, I'll prove it to you, okay. I'll trade you Joey for Rachel, and I'll still win the game.
Oh, oh, I'm, I'm, I'm sorry sweetie, I was just trying to ah, I'm dialing another number.
Okay, bye-bye.
Ow! Ross!!
All right, I just got changed in thirty seconds so you can be alone with him. You'd better go for it.
Please, I'm not going for anything.
But, Elizabeth and I are-are both adults and so I don't think there's really anything you can do about it.
All right look, I-I realize it upsets you.
Yes it does.
I'll call the university and tell them about your relationship and have you fired.
Ohh! A man with a plan!
Hey, here's a question; where did you guys get the finest oak East of the Mississippi?
Oh, that's right! He called to ask out Monica! That-that's gotta be embarrassing!
...DUMB, DRUNKEN, BITCH!!! Thank you, thanks.
Uh-huh, first you tell us where you got the prettiest lace in all the land.
I'm reading your ad.
Oh no. Dad! Dad! What... Oh God...everything's ruined! Dad, she's gonna be crushed!
How are you ever going to sell this place?
I think I accidentally used Monica's boxes to keep the water away from the Porsche.
You don't secretly smoke do you?
No!
Noo, nnnnn. What does this mean? What do you, I mean do you wanna, get back together?
You still love me.
Oh, y-yeah, so, you-you love me!
Noo! Maybe! I, I don't know. Ross, I still can't forgive you for what you did, I can't, I just, but sometimes when I'm with you I just, I feel so...
What?!
Yeah-yeah, help me out here, when you come out of the "brain transplant," you are going to be her?
Cecilia Monroe man, what a great actress.
Oh, tell me about it. And she's been on the show forever, it's gonna be really hard to fill her shoes.
Yes, but in Drake Remoray's body. Why is this so hard for you to get? I thought you were a scientist!
Rach, so, that guy there. Straight or gay?
I don't think charging new clothes too your dad qualifies as making it on your own.
Jill, how did you pay for all this? I thought your dad took away your credit card.
Oh please, I memorized those numbers when I was 15. But look at all the cool make-it-on-my-own stuff I got! This is my "Please, hire me" sweater. And these are my, "Don't you want to rent me this apartment?" pants.
Oh, Mr. Scientist has to get all technical!
Seriously, I don't Rachel's gonna think it's a good idea.
Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work. There was this big dinosaur.. thing.. anyway.
Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here..
Me either...
Hi.
Ross, you remember Susan.
And so what if I like to go home, throw on some Kenny G, and take a bath!
Yeah! And I like to hang out in a quiet place where I can talk to my friends.
Yeah!
We're 29, we're not women.
Ohh, here you are. Y'know, I'm-I'm glad you decided to hear me out.
Whoa-whoa-whoa, Knicks season opener tonight. I thought maybe you guys would come over and watch it.
Hey! So you guys have anything planned for the big last night?
Well, instead of just hanging out, we figure we'd do nothing.
I don't know Ross, not if you're gonna talk about how you gave up a career in basketball to become a paleontologist.
I did give up a career in basketball to become a paleontologist!
Now wait a minute, you be nice! All right? I didn't bring you here so you can ambush her.
Yes, yes it is. It's uh... Every time on the lips! Why?! Why on lips?!
Here's Frannie. Hmm, won't she be happy to see me?
Frannie was the one who found your Playboys and showed them to mom.
That bitch!
Whoa, whoa, but then the back of the couch won't line up with he back of the carpet.
Yeah that-that, doesn't look right.
What are you talking about? The couch is perfectly in line with the carpet. And then I can just walk over here and casually just put my feet right up on the... OK, OK, here's what we do, we just uh, move the couch closer to the coffee table.
OK well here, we'll just move the coffee table closer to the couch.
Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, but then the coffee table won't be centered in the seating area.
One more time, "Hey, don't you want a washboard stomach and rock hard pecs?"
Whoa-whoa-whoa, hey! Now remember what we talked about, you gotta be strong.
Yes. Yes!
No! I want a flabby gut and saggy man breasts!
Good! That's good!
Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, but then the coffee table won't be centered in the seating area.
Whoa, whoa, but then the back of the couch won't line up with he back of the carpet.
OK well here, we'll just move the coffee table closer to the couch.
Yes, but the coffee table doesn't match the...blahebdmsdlkhdyslkd;btyds...Rooosss!!!!
Look, what am I gonna do? I'm not flirting but still, I'm drawing her to me like - like a moth to a flame! What the hell's going on over here?!?!? Monica's gonna kill you! Look I need your help, I have to do something to-to repel this woman! Wait a minute, wait a minute, you guys repel women all the time.
I don't know, but when I spoke to her, she said she had already passed the mucus plug.
She's not here yet. She's not here. She's having my baby and she's not here.
I'm sure everything's fine. Has her water broke yet?
Do we have to know about that?
Joey, what are you gonna do when you have a baby?
Princess Leia, was wearing this, um, gold bikini thing. It was pretty cool.
Do you remember the scene with, um, Jabba the Hut? Well Jabba had as, as his prisoner, um, Princess Leia.
Oooh!
Yeah, oh, Princess Leia and the gold bikini, every guy our age loved that.
Really!
Laugh all you want but uh, she actually left me a message saying she'd like to go out again.
NOW!!!!!!!!
So Ross, how was your date the other night? Did you tell her about the magical ride that starts with the flush of every toilet?
Huh.
Yeah in fact, I'm gonna go call her right now. And I'll make sure to tell her my friend Chandler says...
Just-just so you know I was a freshman and she was a senior. So it wasn't as bad as-as...
Wow! I definitely did not see that one backfiring! I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
Yeah, take your time.
Ross, look, I know I've been giving you a lot of jabs and it's partly because I'm very protective of Lizzie, and partly because well, they just keep coming to me. But I have to admit that after all the wonderful things that Lizzie has told me and the many, many, many stories that Rachel has told me that, well you're not all bad.
Not all bad.
Oh My God, she-she made half a English Trifle, and half a...Sheperd's Pie!
Oh my God, the pages are stuck together!
Chandler!
Oh man! Now she's gonna start all over! We're never gonna get to introduce the hot girls to the new world!
No, no, we will. We just won't tell her she messed up.
Oh well that's great, so I guess this is ah, this is good bye then. Huh? Good bye.
But work comes first! Oh hey, but that's sad about you though, what happened? Burn out? Burn all out, did ya?
Nooo, he's leaving for a better job.
Okay, then.
Okay.
I think on some level, you-you sabotaged your own audition so that Ben would get the part.
I think, sub-consciously...
Wait-whoa-whoa, you lost me.
Well, you're way sounds a lot better than mine. Yeah. Yeah! It's not that I'm a bad actor...
No!
Okay here we are Paul, Elizabeth. So I hope you guys were finding something to talk about.
But uh Ross, Ross is a great guy! I was roommates with him in college. Uh, funny story... You're roommate in college died didn't he?
A part of him did yes.
Yes, we were just...
Hi, I'm sorry I'm late but I am ready, ready to talk you up! When does Liz's father get here?
I assume we're looking for an answer more sophisticated than 'to get you into bed'.
Of course it was a line!
Why?! Why? Why, why would anybody do something like that?
I hate men! I hate men!
Oh no, don't hate, you don't want to put that out into the universe.
Tell you what, maybe one of these weekends you can borrow the car and I cou. . .
Look, I know what you're going through. When I turned 50 I got the Porsche. You... you got your own little speedster.
Guys. Seriously, it is not like that.
Dad, I beg you not to finish that sentence.
What? I'm kidding. You know I'd never let him touch the Porsche.
Gandolf the wizard. Hello! Didn't you read Lord of the Rings in high school?
Joey, you are gonna love this guy. Gandolf is like the party wizard!
Well, why do you call him Gandolf?
No, I had sex in high school.
Oh, uh, Joanna I was wondering if I could ask you something. There's an opening for an assistant buyer in Junior Miss...
Hey, you guys! What do you, what do you think about making that beach trip an annual thing?
No. I'm-I'm to depressed to talk.
I'll give you a thousand dollars to talk to us.
NO!!!
All right, that's it, you guys! What happened out there?
And! We should keep all the stuff uh, we told each other secret from everybody else.
Yeah that was stupid. Let's not do that.
Ohh, absolutely.
Yeah, definitely!
Okay, if you'll excuse me, I-I'm gonna go hang out with some people who don't know the Space Mountain story.
Good morning. Hey pal, look who I brought. It's your old friend Harry Elefante.
Uh, excuse me folks this is a uhh...
Closed set. We know but we're friends with the monkey.
Woah, dude, burn.
I don't get it, he seemed so happy to see me yesterday.
No! No! It would be weird if we were still in that place, I mean are you still in that place?
No!
No?
No! Not at all!
Good! Me neither! So it's not a problem. We're just two friends who happen to be roommates.
Look, I-I drew a sketch about how we're gonna do it. Okay Rach, that's you. That's the couch.
Chandler?! You brought Chandler?! The next best thing would be Monica!
Y'know, I would be offended, but Monica is freakishly strong, so...
Whoa-oh, what's-what's that?
Oh, that's me.
No!! Okay?! Why does everyone keep fixating on that? She didn't know, how should I know?
No I don't, to hell with her, she left me!
And you never knew she was a lesbian...
Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian... Did I say that out loud?
I told mom and dad last night, they seemed to take it pretty well.
Listen, Joey, I know what he did was wrong but don't you think you could at least hear the guy out?
Everything? Even the TV?
No! I'm putting that in my room.
Back when you and Rachel were together, if Chandler had kissed her, would you hear him out?
That's a good point. So uh, how long are you gonna punish him?
Oh. Uh, by the way, if it makes you feel any better. I happen to like 8-year-old boys.
Hi!
One uh, vegetarian pizza. That's $12.15.
What?!
The uh, your hair, before, your hair, you said you thought your looks like an 8-year-old's, and I'm just saying I like it. The hair.
That was just the pants on the couch. Umm, hey, do you, do you mind if I use your bathroom?
No.
Okay, it must just be me then.
No, go ahead.
Thanks.
Yeah. The doctor got the 'K' out. He also found an 'M' and an 'O'.
We just got the message.
Is he alright?
We think he was trying to spell out 'MONKEY.'
Well, the doctor says he's gonna be fine, he's just sleeping now.
A big idiot. Just you have to realize is, this whole Mark thing is kinda hard for me.
I'm sorry, I was an idiot.
A big idiot.
Honey, why is it hard, I mean we've been together for almost a year now?
Well, I was with Carol for like eight years and I lost her. And now if it's possible I think I love you even more. So, it's hard for me to believe that I'm not gonna, well that someone else is not going to take you away.
Well, you can't know where I am all the time. Look, this marriage is never gonna work if you don't trust me.
Emily that's ridiculous. Look, I'm-I'm moving for you, I'm cutting friends out of my life for you. Please, just get on the plane and come to New York. Okay, you'll see you're the only person I want to be with.
I'll feel better when I'm there, and I can know where you are all the time.
You're right.
So, can you trust me?
I may not know any of your flash dances but I'm no slouch on the dance floor.
Mom, I'm hungry.
Dance with your father.
Alright.
Oh, Jack.
Hey-hey, it's valid okay? And I'm not the only one who thinks so, Monica agrees with me.
We were on a break!
Y'know Ross why don't you put that on your answering machine!
What?!
I don't know.
No, no, no I don't want to know, don't want to know. Ok, you know, I should probably, I should probably just go.
Ok, what, what...ok, what did we think it was going to be?
It's a...
Well, thanks for the books.
No problem, ok, mmmwa oh, mmmwa Susan...
Oh yeah it's fine. I guess the more muscles you have the more they can spasim out of control.
Yeah.
Is your back feeling better?
Kristen?
Joey!
Yeah, well, does he look upset? Does he look like he was just told to shove anything?
Okay, okay, what's going on?
Okay, they're just talking...
No, no actually, he's smiling.. and... Oh my God, don't do that!!
What? What? What?!
Ok, Pheebs! How 'bout we'll each just pay for what we had. It's no big deal.
Whoa, whoa, prom night flashback.
I'm sorry, Monica, I'm really happy you got promoted, but cold cucumber mush for thirty-something bucks? No! Rachel just had that, that, that salad, and, and Joey with his like teeny pizza! It's just...
Not for you.
All right, what's goin' on?
She said, "Thank you." I said, "I love you." And she said, "Thank you."
Thank you.
Oh, you're totally welcome! What'd she say?
Whoa-whoa, wait a minute, did you say, you love her?
Yeah, what were you trying to get her to do?!
No, I mean it's okay, I mean, they're-they're my friends. In fact, I-I-I was married to one of them.
I tired attacking two women, did not work.
What?!
Let me get this straight man, you attacked your ex-wife?!
Oh, no! No-no! No, I tired! But I couldn't. That's why I'm here. Maybe we could attack them together? That-that's a no.
Ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect... So what's new? Still, uh...
You look great. I, uh... I hate that.
Sorry. You look good too.
A lesbian?
Well... you never know. How's, um.. how's the family?
Oh. Listen, have you ever been uh, you know, foolin' around with a girl and uh, she started laughin'?
That was 14 hours ago.
So how'd it go?
Yeah, but uh, it was 1982 and my flock of seagulls haircut was tickling her chin.
She laughed at you?
Alright, now, you sure? Phoebe just threw away two jacks because they didn't look happy...
OK, so at this point, the dealer...
Alright, you know, we got it, we got it. Let's play for real. High stakes... big bucks...
But... I'm ready, so, just deal.
OK, alright, last minute lesson, last minute lesson. Joey... three... eight. Eight... three. Alright babe, deal the cards.
There's nothing the matter with me. See, I'm not completely devoid of sentiment, see I have feelings.
Would you stop?! What is the matter with you?!
Oh-ho-ho, we've got company.
Okay, fine.
You can't tell, but I'm trying to break the tension by mooning you guys!
Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket.
Absolutely.
Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out.
The problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter how great the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y'know? I mean, we're in the car, we're fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake.
Yeah, well, word of advice: Bring back the comedian. Otherwise next time you're gonna find yourself sitting at home, listening to that album alone.
All right! All right! Chandler entered a Vanilla Ice look-a-like contest and won!
Why would they do that?! It was a good show right?!
You wanna tell secrets?! Okay! Okay! In college, Ross used to wear leg warmers!
Ross came in forth and cried!
Oh my God!
Uh... Oh hey, do you, uh ...do you have any, um, Cinnamon Fruit Toasties?
Mitzi is.....
My hamster. I hope she's okay, I haven't seen her in a while. Have a seat.
What?
Well, I do! Why don't we go back to my place, light a couple of candles, break open a box of Cinnamon Fruit Toasties, uh...
Oh umm, there's also a book here by a woman named Wendy Bagina. What is that?
Okay, okay, I was typing names into the library computer earlier, y'know-y'know for fun, and I typed mine in and guess what came up? My doctoral dissertation! It's here! Yeah, it's right-it's right down here! In the biggest library in the university!
Wow that's actually pretty cool.
Sounds like two people are really enjoying the Dewey decimal system.
I'm so sorry!
Take from me, as the groom all you have to do is show up and try to say the right name.
Oh, I got some thoughts on that.
Oh wait Chandler, too many cooks...
Okay!
What in God's name is that?!
Ok. Here's his diaper bag, and his uh, Mr. Winky, and uh...oh, him. Hi!
Hey, Julie! Hey, how are you doing?
Um, oh, I don't know. I mean, it's definitely weird not being with Ross, but I guess I'm doing OK. Actually I've got some of his stuff that he, um....
So how did everything go?
Oh, great. Great. There was a projectile, uh, throwing up incident, but he started it.
Me. Was that not clear? Hey, why don't, um, why don't I just join you both, here?
Oh, you uh, you wanna hear a freaky coincidence? Guess who's doing laundry there too?
Who?
Don't you have a laundry room in your building?
Yes, I do have a laundry room in my building, um, but there's a.... rat problem. Apparently they're attracted to the dryer sheets, and they're goin' in fine, but they're comin' out all.... fluffy. Anyway, say, sevenish?
Well why not?! She'll-she'll love it! It's the real thing! I got it at Pottery Barn.
It's my new apothecary table!
Ross! Phoebe's gonna be here any second, she cannot see this!
I know you did! I bought the same one! And if she sees your table she's gonna know that I lied to her. I told her ours was an original.
Why did you do that?
Okay, okay. Uh, well uh, Rachel is going to need to yell sweet nothings in his ear.
No, no, that's funny. But maybe it's time to move on, let it go, y'know? Stop it! Besides, Rachel is going out with Elizabeth's father, so ah, he's much older than she is. Looks like I'm not the only one interested in fossils, huh?
I mean Ross all that does is remind us that you are interested in fossils.
Ross.
Oh, come on you guys; that's funny! Y'know? Because he's need-he's got like a hearing aide y'know, 'cause-'cause y'know, 'cause he's all old, and...
Hey! That was a practical purchase! I needed that car for transportation! Okay? I-I have a child!
Nothing. I don't want to do anything.
Well, doing nothing on your thirtieth is better than doing something stupid, like Ross.
How hot do I look in this, huh?!
Ross, a sports car? Wouldn't it have been cheaper to just stuff a sock down there?
No Chandler, everything! Like stuff you like, stuff she likes, technique, stamina, girth....
Women tell each other everything. Did you know that?
Umm, yeah.
Girth? Why, why, why, wh-why, why, why, why would they do this?
Rachel says sharing's great and supposedly, you know, we outta be doing it. Do you wanna?
All right, I see what you guys are saying. I'll uh, I'll go downstairs and fill out an application.
How about you?
It's a kitchen slash bathroom.
We are bad people.
He knew we were trying to get rid of him. He knew! You think we could get a bathtub in our kitchen?
I know when I'm 90 she'll be like 80 and it won't seem like such a big difference.
Besides, there's a big age difference.
Oh, well think of it like this, when you're 90...
No that's not what I was going to say at all. No, what I was going to say is when you're 90 you'll still have the memory of what it was like to be with a 20-year-old.
Hey Chandler! Y'know that girl you went to college with who-who became a movie director?
Did you talk about the night of five times? Do you tell people about the night of five times?
Hmph. So what you, you tell each other everything?
Pretty much.
Uh, honey, yeah that was with Carol.
I know, but it's still worth mentioning, I think.
Okay, okay, I'll tell 'em it wasn't Chandler who got high. Now who should I say it was?
Ross, I can't believe you'd do that!
The reason we haven't told them we're together is because they hate me, okay? So will you fix this?
You! It's not like it's a big deal! You-you don't still do it or anything!
Alright, alright, now-now who should I say tricked me into doing it?
Well, you should've seen the guy that she used to go out with. I mean, he's like Joe Rugby.
Ross! They're gonna kill you!
Well, why are you doing this anyway?
You're kidding! And he plays rugby?! That's so funny. Ohh! I see how you did that. All right.
Anyway, she thought the very idea of me playing rugby with him was like hilarious. So I'm gonna show her how tough I really am!
J-j-just relax, nobody yelled. Jack just was calling to make sure that you were getting better.
Hello? No she can't come to the phone right now. Oh, right no problem. Okay, bye-bye.
Was it my work? Were they mad? Was it Jack? Did he yell?!
Thank God.
Yeah, she's fired.
It's called the Bapstein-King comet, okay? Hey! Hey! Bapstein was a very well respected astronomer!
Joey!
What?! All right-Hey! Don't look at me! You're the one who wanted to come up and look for some stupid Burger King comet!
Oh no! No! No!
Monica!
This was Carol's favorite beer. She always drank it out of the can, I should have known.
Done with the bookcase!
All finished!
Hey-hey-hey-hey, if you're gonna start with that stuff we're outta here.
Yes, please don't spoil all this fun.
Oh, sure. Whoa-whoa, what's this? The delivery charge is almost as much as the couch!
Yeah?
Yeah. Could you just sign right here please?
Wait! No, that's ridiculous. Come on, he lives three blocks away!
Yeah, y'know what? I'll take it myself, thank you! All right Rach, let's go!
Oohh, 23. Which is what we play to at this casino! You win 10 dollars!
All right. Y'know what? We don't have to go downstairs! We can bring Vegas up to us! All right, come on, come on, we'll play some blackjack. Here we go. 13.
Hit me!
I bet 20.
You're right!
Umm, say you're gonna be starving after all this moving. What do you say I take you to dinner tonight?
Smooth.
Excuse me?
Oh I'd like that.
Yeah?
I know, I know, it's, it's almost... What do you say we go take a walk, just us, not them?
Ohhh.
Oh, oh, this is good, this is really good.
Let me get my coat.
Ok. No, hey, whoa, whoa, I'll get your coat.
Rach, come on, if you think about it, it's actually kinda funny. Okay, maybe it's best not to think about it.
Okay, maybe it wasn't my best decision. But I just couldn't face another failed marriage.
Okay, let me just jump in and ask, at what point did you think this was a successful marriage?
Okay, this is inexcusable. I am shocked to my very core!
Phoebe, I told her you already knew.
Is that why in junior high you were the only one that hung out with that Ukrainian kid?
You had fantasies about Emily?
No! Y'know, the fantasy! Meet someone from a strange land, fall in madly love, and spend the rest of your lives together.
Yeah that, plus his mom used to put sour cream on everything!
Ahh.
Hey, when the music starts up again, I was thinking of maybe goind into the robot, y'know?
No!
Me too!
Ross, I think we should stick to the routine, we don't wanna look stupid!
Alright we're back! Ten seconds left here we go! Ten! Nine! Eight! Seven!
Thanks. Oh! So for tomorrow, do you want to rent a car and drive down together or what?
Wow, did not know that! May I say how lovely you look today?
Duly noted.
What are you talking about?
Cousin Frannie's wedding, its tomorrow night.
Well it's really. . . sexy. I wouldn't have thought it would be but. . . wow.
Lemme see.
Well?
Really?
Yeah, so uh, is it sore or can you do stuff?
I had no idea. And that-that pillowcase thing, I thought you guys were just doing the flying nun.
I don't know. A month?
Emily has probably been planning it since she was five! Ever since the first time she took a pillowcase and hung it off the back of her head. That's what we did! We dreamed about the perfect wedding, and the perfect place, with the perfect four-tiered wedding cake , with the little people on top. Thanks. But the most important part is that we had the perfect guy who understood just how important all that other stuff was.
Sometimes we were.
Come on. You gotta help me figure out what to do. Okay?
Really?! So what would you say Pheebs? Stuff like uh, "Keep your mitts off my grub?"
I'm surprised you didn't go home wearing your lunch.
Okay, look you wanna hold onto your food? You gotta scare people off. I learned that living on the street.
Say Ross, when you picture Phoebe living on the street, is she surrounded by the entire cast of Annie?
Okay, this will keep them away from your stuff.
No, no way. You've got it totally the other way around my friend. John Voit was...
Fine, go have sex.
No. You have got it completely wrong. John Savage was deerhunter, no legs, John Voit was coming home, couldn't feel his legs.
Honey.
What, what oh....
Okay, okay. This morning you said there was nothing so big that we couldn't work past it together...
What?
I really think you need to go now.
Yeah, what the hell did I know!
Look, look, there's got to be a way we can work past this. Okay, I can't imagine, I can't imagine my life without you. Without, without these arms, and your face, and this heart. Your good heart Rach, and, and....
That's so Janine, you-you-you know what, do you know we're doing right now? You and I, we're interfacing.
So it said that by the year 2030, there'll be computers that can carry out the same number of functions as an actual human brain. So theoretically we could download our thoughts and our memories into this computer...
...and live forever as a machine!
Yeah, I gotta go.
Ba dum bumb cheshhh!
Oh great! We're going out again Saturday. But I just found she's also seeing some other guy.
Hey.
Hi! How'd it go?
Really?! Joe? What would you do if you were in Ross's situation?
Well, I sorta am. I mean yeah, I'm dating this girl who's also seeing another guy. But, I don't know, I'm not to worried about it.
I'm sorry. What was I supposed to do stand up and shout 'Hey, Rachel, your butt is showing!'
Thank you, Okay, Okay.
Why the hell didn't you tell me!
Oh my God this is sooo humiliating. I think the only thing that tops that was, was, was when I was in the eight grade and I had to sing the Copa Cabana in front of the entire school. I think I got about two lines into it before I ran and freaked out. Oh my God, my entire life is flashing before my eyes.
Rach, hey look, I remember that, it wasn't so bad.
Uh, what you said, about us being in a place where we could finally be happy for each other.
Hey! You were so right!
What?
Oh, hmm.
I mean, I, I-I admit I-I wasn't quite there. Y'know, I mean the thought of you and that-that Josh guy...
Yeah, kinda. It's this woman from work. I hope that won't be too weird. Will it, Rach?
Uh, no, it's-it's just this person.
Like a date type person?
No. No, not at all, not at all. I actually was gonna bring someone myself, so...
But you said one.
Lo que sucedio es que no le gusta la tele!
Hola, amigos!
Mira, Ross, Marcel se llevo el control remoto.
Hey, guys.
Hey.
How about we settle this right now! There! Now, no one's going to the game. Ha-ha-ha!
If it does? Then you're an amazing friend of mine.
Hey-hey guys, hey! How about we settle this over a friendly game of Fireball? Huh? I'll go unhook the smoke detectors!
I paid for those tickets!
No you didn't. You said you would, but you never did!
Yeah. Look, you don't, you don't talk about like, you know, your girlfriend and the intimate stuff you, you do with her.
That's different, okay. That's like, uh 'Who dated a stripper?' or 'Who did it on the back of the Staton Island Ferry?'.
Were both of those Joey?
Not even with your best friend.
Noo!
Honey. Honey, have you seen my Harmon Kilerbrew bat? Bob doesn't believe I have one.
Judy, going to the bathroom, good for you.
Thank you Richard, I appreciate the support.
I have no idea. Did you know Richard has a twinkie in the city?
I know. He's like a new man. It's like a scene from Cocoon.
It's a girl! Anyway, it wou-it wouldn't matter. Okay? Because I'm a teacher and she's a student.
A hot girl's at stake and all of the sudden he's Rain Man.
Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, why are we so sure that this is a girl?
Oh, is that against the rules?
No, but it is frowned upon.
Oh-oh really? Did you confuse it with your own turkey sandwich with a Moist Maker?
You ate my sandwich?
It was a simple mistake. It could happen to anyone.
No.
Do you perhaps seeing a note on top of it?
Well, I'd love to! Here, you wait right here and I'll go get the projector and my notes!
Wow! Really?!
Totally, I love them! And, maybe you could finish telling me about all the different kinds of sand.
Oh great! Thanks Ross, you're such a good friend!
Ohh!
No, I'm genuinely sorry the Mark thing didn't work out. Look, Rach, I want only good things for you.
Bummer.
Yeah, right. Look at you, you're practically giddy.
Wait a minute, why don't you just call Mark. I mean, who says you have to sit here and wait for him, you've got to make stuff happen.
But, you, you don't want to seem too pushy.
Yes, but also Hanukkah! See, you're part Jewish, and-and Hanukkah is a Jewish holiday.
Yep, and you know what other holiday is coming up?
Christmas eve.
Santa has reindeers that can fly!
Right, um, but, on Hanukkah, Hanukkah is a celebration of a miracle. See, years and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees.
Hey, I've been doin' it since the ninth grade, I've gotten pretty damn good at it.
The point is I... I don't need this right now, OK. It, it's too late, I'm with somebody else, I'm happy. This ship has sailed.
Yeah, what're you saying, you just sort of put away feelings or whatever the hell it was you felt for me?
Alright, fine, you go ahead and you do that, alright Ross.
Fine.
No, Rach, come on. Rach! Rach, no, no! She's not Rachel, she is, she is not, Ra--Rachel?
No, no, wait, ok, ok, look at the other side. Look at Julie's column.
She is not Rachem. What the hell's a Rachem? Is that some stupid paleontology word that I wouldn't know because I'm just a waitress.
My diary! My diary, that's brilliant. I should have told her it was my diary, she never would have made me read her my diary.
You know, that's true. You'd be a great person to have around the day after an emergency.
I am really not going. I don't get it. They already live together, why do they need to get married?
Oh, you are so great! Thank you!
Are you really not going?
They love each other, and they wanna celebrate that love with the people that are close with them.
If you wanna call that a reason.
Ow, ow, OK. Alright, alright, Mon, Mon, you've gone ultrasonic again, alright.
Well, I guess we could tape Entertainment Tonight.
Not that, this, US. Oh my God, Ross, you-re, you're, it's jus-, you-, ever sin- you been here.
I just can't stand you being here all the time.
Why, why, why can't you stand me being here? I don't, I, we're just, ya know, we're just havin' fun.
Okay, first of all, I don't play with cheaters, and second of all, you know I had swollen glands!!
Woo-yay!!
No! Listen, I'm not gonna go through this with you again, okay. Just once I wanna beat when you can't blame it on the broken nose, the buzzer, or the fact that you thought you were getting mono. Let's just call this, tie score and it's halftime.
Y'know what? I'll think you'll play.
Oh really! Why is that?
No, no, don't, don't, rub it! Don't! What gets out hummus?! What gets out hummus?!
I'm so sorry.
What am I gonna do?
Monica, Monica, you know what gets out hummus.
If it is a new message, what is he calling to say?
A no sex pact huh? I actually have one of those going on with every woman in America.
Hey the wedding is so close! Are you getting nervous?
Yeah. But a part of me also can't wait 'til it's over. Chandler and I have this pact not to have sex again until the wedding.
Hey Phoebe, will you give me a hand?
Sure.
The flirting! Aren't you supposed to be going out with, I don't know hmm, let's say my sister?!
What the hell was that?!
What?
I was not flirting.
It was totally flirting. "Somebody got a haircut "
Okay, Phoebe just-just get-get on the bike and-Hey! I'll hold you up and-and push you. Okay?
Well let there-what if a man comes along and puts a gun to your head and says, "You ride this bike or I'll sh...I'll shoot you."
Okay, I would ring the bell to distract him and then I would knock the gun out of his hand with a Chinese throwing star.
You won't let go?
No!
Look who I found standing outside of the Szechwan Dragon staring at a parking meter.
Hey!
Hi you guys!
Mon. Hi!
Hi.
Wow, cool poster. Or should I say groovy poster? So, ahh, where were we?
How about all the way.
Okay.
Are those your teeth??
Ohh, you can see them, huh?
Jill, how did you pay for all this? I thought your dad took away your credit card.
Sorry!
I just had the hardest day. Those bags are so heavy.
Oh please, I memorized those numbers when I was 15. But look at all the cool make-it-on-my-own stuff I got! This is my "Please, hire me" sweater. And these are my, "Don't you want to rent me this apartment?" pants.
I don't think charging new clothes too your dad qualifies as making it on your own.
The blond woman is my ex-wife, and the woman touching her is her... close, personal friend.
I'm just sayin' if dogs do experience jet lag, then, because of the whole um, seven dog years to one human year thing, then, when a dog flies from New York to Los Angeles, he doesn't just lose three hours, he loses like a week and a half.
That's funny. Who are they?
You mean they're lovers.
If you wanna put a label on it.
So, I just picked up a message from Emily, she and Susan are going to a poetry reading together!
Oh, no!
No, it's all right. I got nice boobs.
So?
So! Poetry? Susan's gay! They're being gay together!
Y'know, it-it doesn't matter. The important thing is that you're here. You're my friend, and you're here. Oh!
Rach, what uh, what are you doing here?
Hey! Y'know what? You are in our apartment all the time! Okay? This is, this is just a drop in the bucket mister!
Okay, just a little scared. What's going on Ross?
The most amazing thing happened tonight. I thought my number was up. I had an actual near death experience!
Look, check this out. Is it a coffee table, is it a panther? There's no need to decide.
Art.
Art it is.
Hey, nice pillow. So now tell me, is this genuine Muppet skin?
Hey, excellent, excellent water-table thing.
Oh well, it sounds to me like your family is ready to uh, rediscover its Scottish roots.
What?!
Well it's just my entire family was run out of Scotland by...Vikings. Anyway, lots of bad memories.
No! No-no they're not. They're still very angry! But y'know Chandler is also half-Swedish. You know what the Swedish people are famous for? Sitting down and being quiet.
Well yeah-yeah the Scottish history is so much more...
Y'know what? I can easily get out of this, but there is a chance you can get very, very hurt!
It's not something you are! It's something you have!
Say it!
All right Carl, we're next. Now remember, what is not gonna be?
Another Minute Maid fiasco.
Oww!! My ankle! I really hurt my ankle! I think I twisted it when I-Ooh, a quarter!
Do not rush me!!
Ross, you should know that my pants are startin' to come down and I'm not wearing any underwear!
That really was some of your best work.
Hm-hmm, I told you! I can't believe that I've only got two hours before I call in sick for work.
She says Marcel's humping thing's not a phase. Apparently he's reached sexual maturity.
At the vet.
She's not gonna make you wear one of those big plastic cones, is she?
Hey! He beat ya.
She says as time goes on, he's gonna start getting agressive and violent.
This-this is crazy! I can do this! All right, uhh, I bet I can get all 50 before dinner.
No, just give me another minute.
Look Ross, if you don't know them by now, you will never know them, okay? That is the beauty of this game. It makes you want to kill yourself.
Okay, but if you can't...no dinner!
You're on!
I- I- I ca- I can't believe this. I mean, all I asked you to do was keep him in the apartment.
...Yeah?
Well, I kind of... I kind of lost him.
I know, I know, I'm sorry-
No, y'know what, I guess it's partially my fault. Y'know, I shouldn't've, uh, asked you to start off with a monkey. I should've started you off with like a pen or a pencil.
Listen. Um, listen. Something you should... know... um, Rachel and I... we're kind of a thing.
Paolo. Hi.
Ross!
Thing?
Thing, yes. Thing.
Oh, Liam. So uh, what, were you guys playing soccer or something-or should I call it football?
Well, actually the last time you and I saw each other was that morning.
Oh, Liam.
We were playing rugby.
In fact we're playing a game at the park tomorrow. You're welcome to play too if you want.
Damn, this coffee's cold! Hey Rach, do you mind if I heat this up on your loins?
Hey, what are you guys, what are you guys talking about?
Nothing!
Y'know, I can not believe you told him, Joey!
So I guess you bought that book after we broke up huh?
Listen, I'm ah, I'm sorry I've been so crazy and jealous and, it's just that I like you a lot, so...
I'm so proud of you.
Me too!
I know.
Yeah.
11, unbelievable 11 is correct. All right, that's 4 for the guys. Ladies, you're up.
Two seconds...
Uhh, 11!
All right!
Come on!
Getting married. Okay. Okay. You can, you can do that too! Just like you've done everything else!
I'm telling you, just a little bit at a time.
Yeah okay. Well, what's the next little bit?
Yeah. You're right. Hey I-I can do that.
Yeah.
I'm sorry, it's just one of my last nights together before she leaves for camp-to be a counselor!
Oh no, I have plans with Elizabeth.
Oh, so you're already doing your part for the kids.
Ross let me ask you a question. All jokes aside, where is this relationship going?
Wait a minute, all jokes aside? I didn't agree to that!
Oh, okay, y'know what this is? This is a difference of opinion. And when that happens in a marriage...
I don't know if it's true.
Oh b-b-but it is!
Oh Ross, come on! This is not, this is not a marriage!! This is the world's worst hangover! Ross, listen, if you do not get this annulment, I will!
All right. All right, I'll do it.
Correct. In what part of her body did Monica get a pencil stuck at age 14?
Correct. Her actual favorite movie is...
Weekend at Bernie's.
Oh!
Eww! No!! Her ear! All right, Monica categorizes her towels. How many categories are there?
That's not what this is about okay? I-I am a sports car enthusiast. I have always been into cars.
How hot do I look in this, huh?!
Ross, a sports car? Wouldn't it have been cheaper to just stuff a sock down there?
Hey, what's the horsepower on this thing?
I don't know, but-but look how shiny!
Huh, I don't know what to pick. Am I more thankful for my divorce or my eviction? Hmm.
Are you aware that you're still talking?
Is anyone thankful for anything else besides a thong?
Wow! See, and I didn't think you'd be able to come up with anything.
I'm sorry. It's just that this is the worse Thanksgiving ever.
Hey. When you guys were kids and you played Happy Days, who were you? I was always Richie.
What does Rachel see in this guy? I love Rachel. I wish she was my wife.
Who's singing?
I was always Joanne.
Question. Was ah, 'Egg the Gellers!' the war cry of your neighbourhood?
Look, if I can just do what Emily wants and get her to New York, I'm sure everything will be fine.
I'll take it all.
Hey, Ross, you're okay with that?
Okay, but don't you think this is a little extreme?
After what I did? Can you blame her?
Rach, come on, open up. Rach, come on, come on, Rach. You got to give me another chance.
I am, uh, I am...
Oh, you must be freezing. You know what you need? How about a nice steaming cup of hot Mockolate?
No.
No?
There never was a library. I mean there are libraries, its just that I ah, I never worked at one.
Ugh, museum.
What happened to the library?
You know what's really good here, the lobster. What do you say shall I just order three.
Yeah, if you're really hungry. It was a joke, I made a joke.
You're not getting away this time mister! Unless you want that ass kicking we talked about!
What?
Hey! Oh!
Ross!
Hiiii-Ya!! I'm serious! You're not walking out on my sister!
Scotch. Alright, I'll be back in 10 seconds with your scotch on the rocks in a glass.
Oh, here, I, I'll get it for ya. Whad'ya want?
Scotch.
Neat.
Cool.
Good! Me neither! So it's not a problem. We're just two friends who happen to be roommates.
No! No! It would be weird if we were still in that place, I mean are you still in that place?
No! Not at all!
Okay, but Ross, eventually you and I are gonna be dating.
Really?! We are?
I just wanna thank you for being there for me today. And I'm sorry I,I almost broke your hand.
Yeah. Here you go.
Thanks a lot. Hey Christine, I got it!
That's ok. I'm sorry I poisoned you.
Yeah. Hey, remember the time I jammed that pencil into your hand?
Well maybe she wouldn't have to be selfish in bed if someone else knew where everything was!
My God!
Oh, I'm sorry. Is that annoying? And speaking about being selfish in bed, how's Whitney?
Oh he knows! For the most part.
Oh hey! Good, you're both here.
Are you sure she's in the cat, or have you been taking your grandma's glycoma medicine again?
You mean the mom you met in Montauk. She was a cat?!
No, no-no, she was a human lady. This is the spirit of my Mom Lily, the one who killed herself.
No Dr. Skeptismo! I'm sure. First of all, okay, there's the feeling. Okay, and for another, how about the fact that she went into my guitar case which is lined with orange felt. My Mother's favourite fish is Orange Roughy... Cats....like....fish! Hi, Mommy. Oh, I haven't seen this smile in 17 years!
Dude, Phoebe's mom has got a huge peni...
Come on! Forty-five minutes! Forty-five minutes the man talked about strappy backed dresses.
So I nodded off a little.
Nodded off!! Ross you were snoring. My father's boat didn't make that much noise when it hit rocks!
Well okay, how about four hours in a freezing museum auditorium listening to Professor Pitstains and he's 'Hey everybody! Remember that thing that's been dead for a gazillion years. Well there's this little bone we didn't know it had!'
First of all it's Professor Pittain! And second of all, that little bone, proved that, that particular dinosaur had wings, but didn't fly.
Well, okay so, I don't have it all worked out quite yet. Just don't say anything to Rachel, please?
Look, all I know is I-I can't have another failed marriage!
So okay what? You're gonna be married to a girl who doesn't even know about it?!-Op, woman! Sorry.
Rachel is one of my closest friends. Although, being the only one who knows anything about this does makes me feel special. Okay!
Okay, stop-stop! Phoebe?!
Well, maybe the crazy fog has lifted and she realises that life without me.... a-sucks.
So Rachel called. Wants to see me. Going over in a minute.
Wow, what-what do you think she wants?
It's possible. You are very loveable, I'd miss you if I broke up with you. I was just trying to be supportive.
Then be supportive like a guy.
Look, no-no, hey, hey, don't worry about it! In nine years, she and I will be right there.
I-I-I found it interesting.
I'm sorry.
Okay, well, I'm gonna clear out some of these boxes.
Ross?
No, no, Carol. There's nothing wrong with it. I just, I just don't think breast milk is for adults.
My breast milk is gross?
This should be fun.
Of course the packaging does appeal to grown-ups and kids alike.
Ross, you're being silly. I've tried it, it's no big deal. Just taste it.
Okay, we could still make dinner if we skipped the appetisers and asked for our check right away.
Joey, I can't believe you would do that for me.
Absolutely! I could be a vegetarian. There's no meat in beer, right?
But, we can't go now. It looks like Rachel's gonna put on a skit.
Oh my God! Have you lost your mind?
No-no-no. I don't have a son named Jordie. We all agreed, my son's name is Jamie.
Who the hell is Jordie?
Your son.
Well, Jamie was the name of Susan's first girlfriend, so we went back to Jordie.
What? Whoa, whoa whoa whoa, what do you mean, back to Jordie? We never landed on Jordie. We just passed by it during the whole Jessy, Cody, Dylan fiasco.
This couch, is cut in half! I would like to exchange it for one that is not cut in half!
That's what I'm telling you.
Did you cut this couch in half?
You're telling me this couch was delivered to you like this?!
Look, I am a reasonable man. I will accept store credit.
You know, you know, actually it's getting better. It is. It is. Let's not go. Anyone for Thcrabble?
Is he gonna be ok?
Yeah, he's just gotta get a shot.
Jacket now.
What about Ben? We can't bring a baby to a hospital.
Oh, I thought it was just a kid yelling, "I'm gay! I'm gay!" Can I bring her in?
I'm engaged!!!!!! I'm engaged!!!!
Yeah, she's been out there for twenty minutes, I'm surprised you didn't hear her on the way over.
Oh no, let her stay out there. It's sweet.
I'm getting married!!!! I'm gonna be a bride!!!! No, I will not shut up because I'm engaged! Ohh, big talk! Huh, why don't you come over here and say that to me?! Huh, buddy?! Yeah, my fiancee will kick your ass! Come on, apartment 20! Apartment 20!
Yeah. But, the good news is that Phoebe said that I could stay at her place for a while. So...
You're kidding!
You're kidding, no!
But you can't stay with Phoebe, Ross! We're-we're roomies!
Look, you guys don't need me here taking up your space.
I'm sorry. See that's the good thing about my job. All the dinosaurs on my table are already dead.
Hi Dr. Greene. So, uh, how's everything in the uh, vascular surgery....game?
It's not a game Ross, a woman died on my table today.
Listen you guys, I don't mean to be a pain about this but, um, I've noticed that some of you are just placing them on. You wanna push the caps until you hear them click. Gunther, where're you going?
I um, was sorta thinking about maybe...
Um.... no. See, I might've had feelings for her at one timenot any more. I justI...
You are way off, pal.
No, I don't think so, see Ross, because I think you love her.
Marcel! Where are you going with that disc?
You are not putting that on again! Marcel, OKif you press that button, you are in very, very big trouble.
I know, I know. Everybody, there's someone I'd like you to meet. Yeah. This is Ben. Ben, this is everybody.
Hey.
Can we come in?
Susan, he looks just like you.
Thanks.
Hey, when the snippy guy sees the routine, he'll wanna build us our own platform!
The routine!
Ross, we haven't done the routine since middle school.
Was it really that good?
We got honourable mention in the brother/sister dance category! Look, it's almost fake midnight, do we really have any other choice?
Yeah Pheebs, come on, you two have completely different styles. Y'know, she's more.. y'know, and you're more
Well, that's pretty much all I'm looking for from these people.
Look at you. All jealous.
beside meeeee-eeee-ee. .
Okay, see, see, everyone else is happy she's done.
There is no way I am letting you drive this car! So why don't you just hand over the keys?
What do you think you're doing?!
Just washing the windshield.
Oh.
No ah-ah-ah! Do not start this car! Okay! Okay! I will give you twenty bucks if you get out of this car right now!
Mr. Morse I need to talk to you about your mid-term exam, I'm afraid I-I had to fail you.
Well we-we don't know for sure. But in my head it-it sounded something like this. Of course, this is just conjecture. Okay, that's uh, that's all for today. Uh Mr. Morse, can I see you for a moment?
Yes sir.
Why?!
Well you need 60% to pass...
So, he's just a nice guy. You really think this Mark doesn't want anything in exchange for helping him?
Oh, he is. And he is so dreamy. I mean, y'know what, when he left I actually used the phrase, 'Hummina-hummina-hummina.'
That's excellent.
Well, I assume I'll have to take showers with him, but y'know, that's true of any job.
How ya feelin'?
Yeah, would you please consider moving here? I mean you were gonna move here anyway, why can't you just do that?
All right Emily, as much as I love you, I'm sorry, I can't move to London without Ben.
I understand that would be difficult.
I don't know, it's just...
Oh-oh-okay, but-but I know, that even though I've been a-a complete idiot up 'til now, I mean, I mean you-you-you have to come here. You have to come here so we can work this out.
Oh, I thought you guys had just been on like four dates, I didn't realise that had become anything, yet.
Oh, no, I didn't mean, uh...
I mean maybe you didn't hear about a serious relationship called me and Joshua?
Oh, no-no-no, no-no-no, it has become, it has-yeah. Oh no, those were four great dates.
Oh. Yeah?
Like 'em, like 'em? Or, I'd like to get store credit for that amount like 'em?
You kissed my girlfriend!
Ooh, I like those sunglasses.

All right everybody, this turkey is ready!
Chandler, have you ever put on a black cocktail dress and asked me up to your hotel room?
What's wrong with being the Bings?
The Bings have horrible marriages! They yell. They fight. And they use the pool boy as a pawn in their sexual games!
No.
Then you are neither of your parents!
Oh, but I've got tickets to the Van Gogh exhibit! I've been waiting like a year for this.
Of course you can take a couple days off work because this trip includes me!
Oh no, wait a minute, wait, I've got a presentation tomorrow. I can't miss that.
Art lover!
What'd you say?
Alright, that's it. I've had enough of this, alright. Gunther, these guys are trying to take our seat.
Alright, I'll tell you what, you call the couch and then, and then we'll call the couch, and we'll see who it comes to.
You know what I keep wondering? Why you two are still sitting here.
Fellas, these guys were here first.
Oh, sorry, I didn't realize.
Fine, she can stay at my place. By the way, what-what does Cassie even look like now.
I was not staring at her. Okay? I was just listening intently. It's called being a good conversationalist. Watch. Say something.
You were staring about eight inches south of there.
She looks exactly like Aunt Marilyn.
Umm, so this Aunt Marilyn is-is-is-is she coming to the wedding?
Oh no-no-no, we're just two people who happen to run into each other here at the coffee house.
Y'know, this is probably none of my business, but weren't you guys supposed to not be seen in public together?
Oh, we're not together.
Oh, sly.
Well, I really wanted to meet you guys, but I have to run. I'll see you later?
Oh my God! I love this apartment! Isn't it perfect?! I can't believe I never realized how great it is!
Hey, yeah! Then we could do that telephone thing! Y'know, you have a can, we have a can and it's connected by a string!
Or we can do the actual telephone thing.
Well that is because your eye immediately goes to the big naked man.
It's amazing! You better hurry up and fill out an application or I'm gonna beat you to it.
No. No. Nothing happened. I shut the drapes to uh, show her slides of my favorite fossils.
I guess so.
So uh, so did anything happen? Because rumor has it you guys shut the drapes!
Oh, slides. So really nothing happened.
Something could've happened. All right? She-she really dug my slides. And-and she was definitely giving me the vibe.
No. You're just gonna have to accept the fact that you're just friends now, OK, you're not... rommmates anymore.
Look, Chandler, he has moved on, OK, you have to too.
But...
OK Phoebe, you ready to try one?
OK. Smelly cat, smell-ly cat, what are they feeding you? Smelly cat Oh woah, oh my God. I mean like, who was that?
Wait a minute, are you doing that thing where you pretend it didn't go well but it really did go well?
Hey! How'd the audition go?
Terrible! I messed up every line! I shouldn't even be an actor!
Yeah, did I fool ya?
Totally!
Hi! Listen uhh, this cat belongs to a little girl. There are flyers all over the place.
You didn't tell her?! Okay, fine! Pheebs?
Yeah? Hi!
I'm sorry, sweetie.
Hey, we can take her back with you if you want.
I mean-no, it's just 'cause, it's just 'cause you and I were like a nightmare. No, but there was some good times.
Oh good, you scared me for a minute.
Shake it off.
No, absolutely. Y'know like it was umm...
Surely you can think of something good.
Well then we'll-we'll see you the day after tomorrow. Mom?! Dad?! What-what...what you guys doing here?!
Yes. Yes. Don't worry. Everything's fine. We'll uh, we'll see you tomorrow at the wedding.
I wasn't invited.
Well you kids talk about this place so much, we thought we'd see what all the fuss is about.
I certainly see what the girls like coming here.
Phoebe, are you, are you mad at me, or something? 'Cause if are please, tell me what it is I did!
Hey Pheebs, what 'cha reading? Pheebs? Hello? Phoebe? Phoe-Phoebe! Come on!
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't see you there.
Well, if you don't know I can't help you.
Well, I don't know.
That's right! That's right! Saran Wrap on the toilet seat so the pee goes everywhere!
Yes! Ben learned a little trick.
Oh yeah? Did he pull the old...
Oh that.
Yeah that! You know I hate practical jokes! They're mean and they're stupid and-and I don't want my son learning them!
Still, you- you say Minnie, you hear Mouse. Um, how about, um.. how about Julia?
...As in Mouse?
As in my grandmother.
Julia..
We agreed on Minnie.
Does it? Does it? Yeah, I wanted to give that whole 'Does it?' part just another glance.
I'm sorry.
Does it?
What are you talking about, Ross, you just said that you read it twice! Look, y'know what, either it does or it doesn't, and if you have to even think about it...
No, Rach, no. I don't, I don't, I don't have to think about it, in fact, I've decided, I've decided that, that it.......does.
Hey. Rachel, I-I-I've been wanting to tell you something for a while now and I really, I just have to get it out.
I said, "Geez, relax Monnnnn."
Hi!
Okay, what's up?
Okay, y'know how you told me I should do whatever it takes to fix my marriage?
Oh, well, when you don't have the cards, you don't have the cards, you know. But, uh... look how happy she is.
: Ahhh, that's alright. Y'know, that's a tough hand to beat.
: I thought we had them!
Airplane! Airport! Airport '75! Airport '77! Airport '79!
Oh, time's up.
Her name is Celia. She's not a bug lady. She's curator of insects at the museum.
Oh, is this the bug lady?
Bzzzz.... I love you, Ross.
So what are you guys going to do?
Oh, I just thought we could go out to dinner, and then maybe bring her back to my place and I'd introduce her to my monkey.
They're still, they're still not coming on man and the lotion and the powder have made a paste!
Hold on.
Ross? You okay?
Really?! Uhh, what color is it?
What difference does that make?!
The only thing I understand is; postponing it is not an option. This is when we're getting married.
I can't ask people to do that? Would you ask people to do that?
Don't you point your pants at me! We have no choice! Anywhere that's half-decent would've be booked months ago, Ross don't you understand? This is our wedding I'm talking about.
So what are you saying? It's now or never?
No. I'm saying it's now.
And if I remember correctly, Ray Ban was the official sponsor of World War I!
Nice shades.
Thanks. Yeah, I figure if I wear these in my scenes at least I won't get spit in the eyes, y'know?
Great! All right. I'll see you later.
Hey, where's Chandler?
Well maybe it's cold in there. Or maybe I screwed up the first date I had in 9 years.
You did so. I swear, I swear How long has she been in the bathroom?
Uh, I don't think she's in the bathroom. Her coat is gone.
That could be it.
Oh, god. You know, this is still pretty hot.
Uh, I'm sorry, you don't understand, I'm, I'm, I'm a friend of his. We uh, we used to live together.
Uh, excuse me, uh, where can we find the monkey?
I'm sorry guys, closed set.
Yeah, and I have a time share in the Pocanos with Flipper.
Ross, there he is.
'Cause Carol's a lesbian. And, and I'm not one. And apparently it's not a mix and match situation.
My marriage, I think my marriage is um, is kinda over.
Oh no! Why?
Oh my God! I don't believe it! Oh, you poor bunny.
I'm an idiot. I mean shoulda seen it, I mean Carol and I'd be out and she'd, she'd see some beautiful woman, and, and she'd be Ross y'know look at her, and I'd think, God, my wife is cool!
Hey lady! I don't care how much you want it! Okay?! I am not gonna to have sex with you in the bathroom!
Is that so?
Yeah.
Hey, y'know in Roman times this was more than just a hat.
Really?
Okay, y'know what, let's just cut to the chase here. Okay? Heidi, which of my boys do you like?
Whoa, whoa, no, no, I-I'm not playing with this guy, now.
Fine with me.
What are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing?
Which do I like?
Look let's not make a big deal out of this! It was a one time thing. It doesn't even matter!
Thunder being stolen!!
Okay come on Phoebe, it's nothing! Monica, come on!
Oh my God! I cannot believe you guys are talking about this! The problems in the bedroom are between the man and the woman!!! All right?!! Now Chandler is doing the best he can!!
I don't think that's what they were talking about Joe!!
We were on a break!!! Okay!! We were, we were..., yeah. Where are you? I'll find you.
Yeah, you're right.
Phoebe hang on a second Ross wants to say something. What? You slept with someone else?!
You slept with another woman?
Oh, you-you're-you're one to talk.
Oh, you guys call him Cute Coffeehouse Guy, we call him Hums While He Pees.
And those guys were this close to lettin' us play this time too.
Hey look-look, Phoebe's talking to uh, Cute Coffeehouse Guy.
Yes, and we call Ross Lingers In The Bathroom.
Hey you guys, Hums While He Pees just asked me out!
So I'm thinking about asking Rachel out tonight. Y'know maybe play her that song we wrote last week.
I know, but y'know, this time you're gonna definitely know whether or not you did it!
I know, I know. And oh, and this time Chip promised that-that this time it will last at least for an entire song!
Emotional Knapsack?
Yeah.
When, when were you... under me? Rach. Rachel do you, I mean, were you, uh. . . What?
Wha... you're uh, you're, you're over me?
Ohh, ohh.
Ohh, OK, OK, OK, well, basically, lately, I've uh, I've uh, sort of had feelings for you.
You've had feelings for me?
Of course it is. Yeah, come on in. Ooh-ooh, go by the window you can pretend to be surfing.
Hey Joey! Great stuff huh?
This is your place?
But I counted, you're not supposed to live here! Oh man!
Ugh!!
I'm gonna get a new band-aid. Hey, how 'bout the time I cut the legs off your Malibu Ken?
I hope Ben has a little sister.
Yeah. I hope she can kick his ass.
That was you?
They, uh, were infected. He wouldn't have made it.
Oh, yeah I know, I know, it's a lot of boxes, but again I really appreciate you guys letting me stay here.
Hey roomies!
Love what you've done with the place.
Not a problem. And listen, hey! Since you're gonna be here for a while, why don't-I was thinking we uh, put your name on the answering machine.
Oh yeah!
Uhh, hey look, I don't really enjoy being with other men that way. But, um, zoo dollars?
Well, yes, yes, the best doctor in all of Salem, Dr. Drake Remore.
Meet me in the nocturnal house in 15 minutes.
It's about your monkey. It's alive.
I don't understand, why didn't you help that man?
Thank you, thanks. Yeah, I lost it. Y'know, I'm not gonna play anymore, would you, can you finish my set?
What?
Phoebe, his music could not get any worse. There are rats in the basement that are hanging themselves.
After that? Yeah! No, I mean if I can help.
Yeah, like I could lose it.
I'm the holiday armadillo! I'm a friend of Santa's and he sent me here to wish you a Merry Christmas!
Two days before Christmas? Sorry, man.
Okay look, do-do, you have anything Christmassy? I promised my son, and I really don't want to disappoint him, um, come on, I...uh, you gotta have something.
What happened to Santa, Holiday Armadillo?
Santa was unavailable so close to Christmas.
Oh, is that funny?! Oh, you-you find that funny?! Well maybe Chandler should know some of your secrets too!
Ross came in forth and cried!
Oh my God!
I-I already told him everything! You shush!!
Once Monica was sent to her room without dinner, so she ate the macaroni off a jewelry box she'd made.
Oh yeah, yeah? Well uh, when we were going out, I read tons of porno magazines! 'Sup?
So I guess you bought that book after we broke up huh?
Uh-huh, yeah I did, because I wore out my first copy when I was with you.
Ross! How could you do that to an old man?!
Excuse me ladies. I'm sorry?
I'm the Holiday Armadillo, your part-Jewish friend. You sent me here to give Ben some presents. Remember?
What are you doing here, Santa?
Well, I'm here to see my old buddy Ben. What are you doing here, weird...turtle-man?
What?
Did you bring me any presents, Santa?
All right, we have a tie. Luckily, I have prepared for such an event. The Lightning Round!
Unfortunately that is correct.
Yes!!
Ohhhh.
Thirty seconds, all the questions you can answer.
Hmm, a lot of this stuff is from Colonial times. Hey, what are some other time periods Rachel?
Oh it does, it does! It is a room separating apparatus from Colonial times.
Ah!
Well there's yore. And uh, y'know, yesteryear.
Yeah no, I'm telling you Rachel has such a great eye for this stuff. Ross, y'know if you ever decide you need to redecorate-And I think that you should. You should, you should ask Rachel to help.
Oh, mine! Mine! Mine! Okay, here goes. Prepare yourselves for some Class A flirting.
Oh, right!
Pizza!
Okay, hold on. Okay.
Honey, you have nothing to prove. And if you really like this girl, I don't flirting is the right thing to...
No! No! I...didn't do that. It's just... Okay, honestly no. I don't, I don't see a big future with her.
Okay, good stuff. Umm, well she's-she's sweet and pretty and...
Look Ross, the only question you need to ask is, "Do you see a future?" I mean like do you see yourself marrying her? Oh my God! You did it already! You married her, didn't you?!
Okay well I think...that's your answer.
I've got to talk to her. Ugh, I hate this part.
Marcel, stop humping the lamp! Stop humping! Now Marcel, come back- come here, Marcel-
That's me.
Oh! The yuk! Ross, he's doing it again!
Oh no, not in my room! I'll get him.
Ross, you've got to do something about the humping.
That's not true! Her, she doesn't even know what she wants! Rachel's still mad about the whole thing.
Y'know I wanted to tell you yesterday, but I just, I kinda felt all floopy, and...
I'm telling ya, you guys are totally getting back together!
Okay, then you gotta back away, all right? You don't need that kind've hurt. Take it from a guy who's never had a long term relationship......
I know, but ahhhhhh!! I really wanna go up there and finish that kiss!
Well, I'm just saying, I mean why else would he just, y'know, swoop in out of nowhere for no reason.
Huh. Sounds like Mark Something wants to have some sex.
What!?
To be nice.
Hey, Joey. Are men ever nice to strange women for no reason?
Well, yeah. I can't-I can't stay here all night, and if I go in there she's-she's gonna wanna... do stuff.
Well, I-I gotta go break up with Bonnie.
Here?! Now?!
Well, can't you tell her that you are not in the mood?
No, she likes that. Yeah. Faking sleep doesn't work either, I can't tell you how many mornings I woke up with her...
Hey, you're not going to believe this. I made up a joke and sent it in to Playboy. They printed it!
I'm giving this lecture on erosion theories tomorrow night, I think you should come.
You're right! That did cheer me up!
I didn't know Playboy prints jokes.
Yeah, they print jokes, interviews, hard-hitting journalism. It's not just about the pictures.
I know what you mean, I've always wondered how different my life would be if-if I'd never gotten divorced.
Why did they get divorced?
Well, apparently she caught him cheating on her with someone else. Isn't that sad? God, could you imagine if I actually married him?! I mean how different would my life be?
Which time?
The first time! No seriously, imagine if Carol hadn't realized she was a lesbian.
Kristen, hi. Are you uh, new to the area, 'cause if you are...I'd love to show you around sometime.
I got it. So hi, I'm uh, I'm Ross and this is my friend Chandler.
I-I am Kristen.
I...I uh, actually just moved from four blocks over.
Ah.
Pity food? Y'know what that's okay, all right, I don't need any of you to stay, okay nobody stays.
What a pity stay?
No! We're gonna have fun. We can make fudge!
Well, then, I might as well offer to stay.
Hey, does anybody else feel bad about Ross?
You know you probably didn't know this, but back in high school, I had a, um, major crush on you.
Hi, sure!
Hi.
I knew.
You did! Oh.... I always figured you just thought I was Monica's geeky older brother.
So, I got us some reservations for Sunday night, okay? How about, Ernie's at 9 o'clock?
Hey!
Hey!
Yeah, well, you uh, better make it for three.
Oh, see I-I don't know if we're gonna be hungry at three.
Y'know what? He didn't want to talk to us about being angry, well maybe we don't talk to him at all!
I can't believe it. Can I tell you something? I'm a little mad at him now.
Can I tell you something? Me too.
Ooooh! Freeze him out.
That's right!
I mean, I, I-I admit I-I wasn't quite there. Y'know, I mean the thought of you and that-that Josh guy...
Uh, what you said, about us being in a place where we could finally be happy for each other.
Oh, hmm.
Joshua.
Joshua...guy at that club, dancing and having a good time, the thought of it kinda...y'know.
Ahem... I want.... OK, I want to... feel your... hot, soft skin with my lips.
OK, turn around. I just don't want you staring at me when I'm doing this.
Alright, alright. I'm around. Go ahead.
There you go! Keep going. Keep going!
I, er...
Look I-I realize if anything were to happen with me and Jill then nothing could ever happen with us!
Oh wait-hold it! But then I started thinking and I stopped the kissing.
Oh, well thank you for taking your tongue out of my sister's mouth long enough to tell me that.
What?!
No, I mean, look I don't know if anything is going to happen with us, again. Ever. But I don't want to know that it-it never could. So I stopped it and she got mad and broke my projector.
OK, got the music, got the dinner. Oh and check it out, I made Marcel's favorite dish, banannacake.
Could ya?
Well, if I was wearing your underwear then, uh, what would you be wearing?. . . You're swell.
Oooh.
With mealworms.
Uh-huh! Uh-huh! And-and-and I'll always remember that summer because that's when I realized that we are related.
Oh right. Right. Ooh, remember the time I uh, I pinned you down and tickled you 'til you cried? We're probably too old to do that now.
I'll always remember that summer, because it's when I got all of these freckles.
It took you that long to figure it out, huh?
Well I'm, I'm a little slow. Just as our children would be.
Ohhhhh yeah, that's, that's funny. Why ah, why isn't he goofing around in his own office?
Hi! What's ah, what's Mark doing answering your phone?
Oh, he's just goofing around.
Oh honey, this is his office too. I told you we're Joanna's two assistants.
Why does Joanna need two assistants, how, how lazy is she?
So, I'm guessing you had an extra ticket and couldn't decide which one of you got to bring a date?
Funny, my birthday was seven months ago.
So?
Well, aren't we Mr. "The glass is half empty."
Oh my God, oh- is today the twentieth, October twentieth?
Look at him. I'm not saying he has to spend the whole evening with me, but at least check in.
Yeah.
Hey, kids...
There you are! Haaah, you got away from me!
But you found me!
She's fine. She doesn't know you're gone. And she doesn't have to know, okay? Now come on, we're going home.
What the hell are you doing?!
Panicking! And using the Internet to try to prove that I'm related to Monica. How is she?
No! No! No! I can't do that!
Why not?!
I'm not gonna tell you what they spent on that wedding... but forty thousand dollars is a lot of money!
I know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish, but, were you planning on bringing up the whole baby/lesbian thing? Because I think it might take some of the heat off me.
What that Rachel did to her life.... We ran into her parents at the club, they were not playing very well.
Well, at least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar...
What's that supposed to mean?
Oh yeah? Well, I'm rubber, you're glue, whatever can't do it. Listen, uh- gimme back my puck.
I found it. Finders keepers, losers weepers.
You gotta do it, man.
No.
'Yes', how about. C'mere. Gimme!
I do-I do not have a boyfriend. There's a guy in one of my classes who-who has a crush on me.
Whoa what?
Ross has a boyfriend.
Really?
Yeah! I don't know. I mean, last year Elizabeth now-now this kid. What-what-what-what is it?! Am I giving out some kind of...sexy professor vibe?
Ohh! Ohh! In college, Chandler got drunk and slept with the lady who cleaned our dorm!
Hey!!!
Ohh, I'm sorry I couldn't think of anymore for Ross!
That was you!
Whatever dude, you kissed a guy.
Well, if he's angry, he really shouldn't just cover it up. I-I wish he would just tell me the truth.
I guess it could.
Well then I think that's it.
Oh, if that's what you want you then you really should run his head under hot water and bang his head against a table.
Honey I made a reservation at China Garden, is that okay?
Man, look at all those stars! Infinite space. It really, really makes you wonder, doesn't it?
What?
Oh I don't-I don't know.
Y'know what else makes you wonder?
Huh?
I thought you were my best friend, this is my sister! My best friend and my sister! I-I cannot believe this!
Well, I think, I think Ross knows about me and Monica.
Dude! He's right there!
Look, we're not just messing around! I love her. Okay, I'm in love with her.
I'm so sorry that you had to find out this way. I'm sorry, but it's true, I love him too.
Look, if she's talking to it, I just think that I should get some belly time too. Not that I believe any of this.
Really?
But um, we just refer to you as Bobo the Sperm Guy.
Oh, I believe it. I think the baby can totally hear everything. I can show you. Look, this will seem a little weird, but you put your head inside this turkey, and then we'll all talk, and you'll hear everything we say.
I'd just like to say that I'm totally behind this experiment. In fact, I'd very much like to butter your head.
Rachel one brunch is not gonna solve anything. You gotta face it, okay we're never gonna get along.
Look sweetie, I could be the bigger man, I could be the biggest man, I could be a big, huge, giant man, and it still wouldn't make any difference, except that I could pick your Father up and say 'Like me! Like me tiny doctor!'
Okay, well can't you just try it one more time Ross? For me? For me?
Okay, well you are just gonna have too, okay. Because I already got a Mother and a Father who cannot stay in the same room together, okay, I don't wanna have to have a separate room for you too!!
Okay, okay, okay. I'll get the bagels.
All right, let's not jump to any conclusions. All right? There was some sexual chemistry between them.
It's this way? Sorry.
I'm right! Right? There was like no chemistry between them. Before they had heat, and now there's no heat! Now you know what this means, Joey told us what this means!
Come on, it was like cousins having sex up there!
Here she comes. Don't say a word, okay? Just be cool, don't be...y'know you.
...nauseous, I'm physically nauseous. What am I supposed to do, huh? Call immigration? I could call immigration!
Wasn't this supposed to be just a fling, huh? Shouldn't it be... flung by now?
I mean, we are way past the fling thing, I mean, I am feeling things that I've only read about in Danielle Steele books, you know? I mean, when I'm with him, I'm totally, totally...
I love babies, with their little baby shoes, and their little baby toes, and their little baby hands...
Ok, you're going to have to stop that, forever!
Oh, but he will. He still tells the story how Monica tried to escape from fat camp.
Listen, I'm sure that dad doesn't care. He probably thought this was funny; he'll be telling this story for years!
I don't want him to tell this story for years.
I wasn't escaping.
Then how did you get caught in the barbed wire?
Well uh, you see that, that little cluster of stars next to the big one? That is Ursa Major.
Sorry.
Ah, so what are we looking at?
Really?
I've no idea, could be. Listen, I'm sorry I had to work tonight.
Or! Or, we could go to the bank, close our accounts and cut them off at the source.
We're doomed. Okay, they're gonna take 50 bucks out of our accounts for the rest of our lives. What are we gonna do?
Well, you could actually go to the gym.
You're a genius!
Aww, man, now we won't be bank buddies!
What?! The guys against the girls? See, that's ridiculous Monica, because I'm only down by three touchdowns.
You're so pathetic! Why can't you just accept it, we're winning because I'm better than you.
Oh, what a great argument, exhaling! All right, y'know what, I'll prove it to you, okay. I'll trade you Joey for Rachel, and I'll still win the game.
Oh, then bring it on! Oh, unless of course your afraid you might lose to a bunch of girls.
Fine, fine, Rachel your with Monica, Joey you're with me.
Oh c'mon! When we were kids, yours was the only Raggedy Ann doll that wasn't raggedy!
Yeah, you are, Monica. Remember when I lived with you? You were like, a little, y'know, Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree!
That is so unfair!
Okay, so I'm responsible, I'm organised. But hey, I can be a kook.
Alright, you madcap gal. Try to imagine this. The phone bill arrives, but you don't pay it right away.
Hey, hello! mmwa! I brought all the books, and Monica sends her love, along with this lasagna.
You think?
Hey hey, come on in!
Oh great! Is it vegetarian, 'cause Susan doesn't eat meat.
I'm pretty sure that it is...
Marc- oh, this is ridiculous! We've been all over the neighbourhood. He's gone, he's-he's just gone.
Marcel?
Marcel?
Ross, you don't know that.
Oh come on. It's cold, it's dark, he doesn't know the Village. And now I have a broken foot. I have no monkey, and a broken foot! Thank you very much.
Come on, man! Just-just take the sweats off. Okay? Just take 'em off and we'll have some fun.
Oh yay!
Y'know, I can't believe Kathy did this too me. I really, thought that she was the one. I tell you what, from now on I'm never getting out of this chair, ever! Okay? From now on, this chair is the one! You wanna what else is the one? My sweat pants!
Hey-hey!
Hi!
Oh, better, actually. Y'know I-I-I think I finally figured out why we were having so much trouble lately.
I have to go. Yeah, Carol should be home by now, soo...
Umm, how's it going with you guys?
Oh, really?
Yeah, y'know how I have you guys, well she doesn't really have any close friends that are just hers, but last week she meet this woman at the gym, Susan something, and they really hit it off, and I-I-I think it's gonna make a difference
Hey, I have a question. Well, actually, it's not so much a question as.. more of a general wondering... ment.
Oh Ross, you're so great.
It's never gonna happen.
Okay.
Okay. Umm, for a while now, I've been wanting to, um....
Come on out, honey! I'm telling you look good! Tell her she looks good, tell her she looks good.
Over my dead body!
And I'll be using his dead body as a shield.
Oh my God, you look so good!
I can not believe I have to walk down the aisle in front of 200 people looking like something you drink when your nauseous.
Honey, just relax, it's gonna be fine. Hey, umm,. why don't I come down there and I'll take you out to lunch?
Your welcome, oh please not the one with the turtles.
No, no, no, no turtles scare me. I don't need that today.
Oh honey, thank you, but Mark's taking me out.
Mark is that ah, the same Mark that helped you get the job?
No, hey-hey, come on, Ben, Santa is not mad at you, okay? Hey, you're-you're his favorite little guy!
No! Oh, no-no-no. Hey, you weren't bad, you've been very good, Ben.
Santa's mad at me.
So Santa's coming?
Yes! Santa's coming!
Did you see the look that girl just gave me? Huh? She must've seen me cruising in the bad boy.
You're fast and irresponsible. That adds up to a bad driver.
Well in High School, that added up to head cheerleader.
I think she's checking out your beehive Ross.
What?! Give-give me a brush.
Y'know what, I don't know how comfortable I am going to see how hot the sex is between some guy and your girlfriend.
Noooo!!
So uh, man, are you gonna go to the play with me tonight?
Yeah, I know but...
Oh no-no-no, I'm there.
Uh, Pheebs, while we're hovering around the subject. I just have to say dinosaurs, they-they don't go, rrroof!
Okay, Phoebe, y'know what? That-that's it, that's it, all right? No dinosaurs, no ghosts, no giant dogs, okay? They're not the right size, they're not Victorian, and they just don't go.
Okay, fine. Come dinosaur, we're not welcome in the house of no imagination.
The little ones do.
Hey, Kate!
He won't? He won't! Because, isn't that, isn't that the, the short story you were writing?
Hey, someone order a coat?
Ross, Chandler wrote something about me on his computer and he won't let me see.
Yes, yes it is, short story, that I was writing.
And I'm in it? Then let me read it.
I don't know, God, I... well, it's not like she's a regular mom, y'know? She's, she's sexy, she's...
Okay, I'm scum, I'm scum.
Ross, how could you let this happen?
You don't think my mom's sexy?
Well... not in the same way...
So, Phoebs owes $7.50, Monica, you owe $10, and Rachel, you owe fifteen big ones.
Alright.
Alright...
But hey, thanks for teachin' us Cross-Eyed Mary. You guys, we gotta play that at our regular game.
Alright, here's my $7.50. But I think you should know that this money is cursed.
Hey, hey, woah, you want some of this, huh? You want a piece of this, huh? I'm standin here, huh.
Ok, so let me just get this straight. So we're uh, strictly talking about the middle?
C'MON!
Hey, hey, those guys are takin our stuff!
Hey.
Oh, it's not so bad. Monica's gonna make potpourri! I think I'm gonna go wander out in the rain for a while.
It came in the mail today, it's uh, 72 long-stemmed red roses, one for each day that I've known and loved Emily, cut up into mulch!
Oh, honey that's awful.
But, it's not raining.
I can't catch a break!
No wait, look. Look! I'm sorry, it's just I've never even met Howard. I-I mean I don't know Howard.
Yes, but I've lived here for 25 minutes.
Oh, okay, I get it.
Howard's the handy man!
Yes but too me he's just, man.
Oh, come on it's only three blocks! And-and, it's not very heavy, try it! Come on! Come on!
Yeah, y'know what? I'll take it myself, thank you! All right Rach, let's go!
Yeah! Are you kiddin'?
Oh. Oh! I can do it!
Yeah!
Look, I really need some help, okay? Why? Why did I have to speak in a British accent?! What do I do?
You just wanna each take one?
Yeah that seems fair. We never use them.
Well...
Why don't you phase it out? Yeah, fade the accent out and people will think you're, y'know, that you're adjusting to life in America.
So are you sure about this whole moving in thing?! I mean it's a really big step! And-and what's the rush?!
But y'know what, if you think it's gonna be okay we'll just work out a system. Y'know, it'll be like college, I'll hang a hanger on the door and put a sign, "Come back later, I'm gettin' lucky."
Yeah, I didn't think of that.
That's very funny!
He's being silly, because he knows that we enjoy the silliness!
Yeah in fact, I'm gonna go call her right now. And I'll make sure to tell her my friend Chandler says...
Laugh all you want but uh, she actually left me a message saying she'd like to go out again.
Huh.
Hey Chandler!
Hey!
"Hey Ross, it's you!" Oh yeah, no that's-that's an old message, nobody needs to hear that.
Oh wait-wait-wait! The message is blinking. Maybe you didn't erase it.
Oh?
No.
Hey umm, was-was Monica here?
Oh, hey hey hey, ho ho ho, hello, guy who doesn't want to know, standing right here!
Oh, that's so... It really is...do we know...?
Yes, we certainly do, it's going to be...
Oh, well, is it what we thought it would be?
Mm-hmmm
Come on! Like I wanted him to tell you, I ran all over the place trying to make sure that didn't happen!
Because they'll know we've been listening.
God! And to have to hear about it from Gunther!!
Oh, that is so sweet. I think I'm falling in love with you all over again.
Y'know what, I think we can go out there. I mean they have more important things to worry about.
Well, I'm sorry, but ah, look if you're not working with him anymore, why do you have to still do stuff with him?
Oh, well...
Oh my God!!! Ross!!
Because, he's my friend.
Okay, but do you really need another friend? I mean...
No, four minutes ago you had a half hour, we have to be out the door at twenty to eight.
Why aren't you guys dressed?
We have a half hour.
Relax Ross, we'll be ready. It only takes us two minutes to get dressed.
Well, you know, I'd feel a whole lot better if you got dressed now.
No no, this big pile of dishes in my mom's breakfront. Do you guys know who Carl is?
....I have to go to China.
The country?
Uh, let's see... Alvin... Simon... Theodore.... no.
Well, Rachel's having drinks with him tonight.
Just the one divorce in '99! Y'know what, I am gonna be happy this year. I am gonna make myself happy.
Y'know what? I'm gonna go out on a limb and say no divorces in '99!
But your divorce isn't even final yet.
Do you want us to leave the room, or?
Everyday I am gonna do one thing that I haven't done before. That my friends is my New Year's resolution.
Okay, Andr should be there in like 45 minutes. All rightie, bye bye. Just easier that way.
Well,fall out of it. You know, you shouldn't even be here, it's a school night. Oh god, oh god. I'm like those women that you see with shiny guys named Chad. I'm Joan Collins.
Who?
Oh, come on. You told me about the last dream.
No, forget it.
A new place for a new Ross. I'm gonna have you and all the guys from work over once it's y'know, furnished.
Well actually, Ross doesn't.
Yes, and we'd appreciate it if no one told him yet.
I must say it's nice to see you back on your feet.
Well I am that. And that whole rage thing is definitely behind me.
Okay, I have nothing in an evening shoe in the burgundy. I can show you something in a silver that may work.
And where she's going everyone else'll be dressier?
Could we see something in a slimmer heel?
No, it really should be burgundy.
Mm. Unless we go with a different dress?
Wait a minute, is it because Joey and I didn't invite him to that Knicks game a couple of weeks ago?
I can't think of anything.
Come on Ross, you're a paleontologist, dig a little deeper.
Do you think that's something that he'd be mad at you for?
I guess it could.
Let me finish, okay? She started kissing me and-and I didn't stop it. I guess I-I just wasn't thinking...
Look, I uh, I tried not to kiss her, okay?
Well, it doesn't sound like it! I mean, it's pretty easy not to kiss someone, you just don't kiss them! See look at us, right now, not kissing!
Yeah that's right you weren't thinking! Y'know what? Let me give you something to think about!
Oh wait-hold it! But then I started thinking and I stopped the kissing.
Well remember that paper I had published last year on sediment flow rate, huh? They loved it.
No-no-no, that's great! I'll be there Monday. And thank you again! Okay. Umm, that was the head of the Paleontology department at N uh, Y, uh U!
Wow! Uh what, did he uh, say?
Well, who wouldn't?!
I know! Anyway, they asked me to be a guest lecturer! I mean it's temporary, but uh, if they like me it could lead to a full time job. How great would that look great on a mailbox, huh? "Professor Geller."
Wha--? Whoa, hey, I don't want my birthday to be the source of any kind of negative--there's gonna be a hoopla?
So um, how come you guys haven't talked about this before?
'Cause it's always somethin', you know, like Monica's new job, or the whole Ross's birthday hoopla.
Basically, there's the thing, and then there's the stuff after the thing.
If it makes anybody feel better, then we can just forget the thing, and we'll just do the gift.
Okay, I've got to go pick up Ben but I-I will figure something out. Hey, didn't he used to have a cat?
Yeah, he broke those too.
So he likes to break stuff.
I wouldn't bring that up, it would probably just bum him out.
Yeah, poor cat, never saw that big butt coming.
The carbon, it's messy, I mean it gets on your fingers and causes, the, the ah, night blindness.
Oh, ah, you don't need that.
Why not?
What is this? Who put a twenty down here? Huh?
Oh, yeah, that would be me, um, I have, I have a problem I-I tip way too much, way, way, too much, it's a sickness really.
No! I talked to Joey on the set, he hasn't heard from him. I-I-I talked to Chandler's parents again!
Just for the future, this is hardly a commercial for it.
Anything?
You told them he was missing?
No! I made it seem like I was just calling to chat. Pretty sure, they both think I'm interested in them.
Oh, thanks. Yeah, I really thought we'd be able to make it work, but uh, I guess it just wasn't meant to be.
Hey, come on in.
Oh thank you. Hey y'know, I'm so sorry to hear about you and Elizabeth.
Yeah, love. It's a tricky business isn't it?
I guess so.
Look. Look, I wasn't going to say anything to you, but... All right, I don't think you should be seeing Tommy anymore.
7:15. Watch doesn't work.
Tommy's supposed to be here soon, we're going to lunch.
You don't?!
No! The guy is mean. I mean really mean. I think you should stay away from him.
OK, I have a question. Well, actually, it's not so much a question as.. more of a general wondering... ment.
Yuh-huh! I was the last one to know when Chandler got bitten by the peacock at the zoo. I was the last one to know when you had a crush on Joey when he was moving in. Looks like I was second to last.
Hmmm... this is so nice.
OK.
OK. Here goes. For a while now, I've been wanting to, um....
Hey uh, well, today's my first lecture and I kinda wanted to try it out on you guys, do you, do you mind?
Hey everyone!
Oh hi!
Oh that'd be great. Sure!
"There are three primary theories concerning sediment flow rate. Each of these theories can be further subcategorized into two distinct..."
Just one uh, one additional relationship thought. Probably something your already familiar with, uh, women talk!
Hey. Uh, Chan, can I uh, can I talk to you for a second?
Sure. What's up?
Welcome everybody, welcome to Amazing Discoveries!
Oh, oh! It's on again!
Huh, what's fish hooking... Thanks man, that would have been really hard to describe. What is that taste?
Yeah, anything goes, except ah, eye gouging and fish hooking.
What's fish hooking?
What? My hands are totally clean, I just gave the duck a bath.
So thanks for the warm welcome. It's good to have you guys on my team, and I come to play. I hope you do too. Now, let's go out there and get 'em! Huh? And remember, there is no 'I' in team.
...So I think Alan will become the yardstick against which all future boyfriends will be measured.
...What shoe?
From the nursery rhyme. 'There was a crooked man, Who had a crooked smile, Who lived in a shoe, For a... while...'
What future boyfriends? Nono, I th- I think this could be, y'know, it.
Really!
Oh, Monica, I figured I'd come by tomorrow morning and pick up Fluffy's old cat toy, OK?
Hi guys.
Hey.
Only if you say his full name.
Can I come over tomorrow and pick up Fluffy Meowington's cat toy.
I don't know. It's going to be weird not having a job for a while, but I, I definitely don't care about my sandwich.
Wait a minute, they're making you take time off work?
And you're okay with that?
Ugh, that was so embarrassing! I can't believe you let me go on and on like that!
I'm sorry. It was just so funny when you started comparing Jane Eyre to Robocop.
I think when someone steals your credit card, they've kind of already thrown caution to the wind.
Monica, would you calm down? The credit card people said that you only have to pay for the stuff that you bought.
I know. It's just such reckless spending.
Wow, what a geek. They spent $69.95 on a Wonder Mop.
That's me.
Hey, Rach, you know what? I think, I think I know what'll make you feel better. How 'bout you make a list about me.
Well, maybe the mailman liked the cookies, we just didn't give him enough.
Monica, pigeons learn faster that you.
Wha... forget it Ross, no, I am not gonna stand here and make a list of. . .
C'mon Rachel.
Gunther! Gunther. Gunther, please tell me you didn't say anything to Rachel about me and the girl from the Xerox place.
But you should probably talk to my roommate, because I told him and he knows Phoebe too.
Who's your roommate?
I'm sorry. Was I not supposed to?
Ow!
That's true, thanks dad. People should be dancing! Huh? Hey, this is a party! Come on! Joey, dance!!
And, I love you!!
Boy, bad time to say the wrong name, huh Ross?
Yes, Waltham interiors.
Uh, hello, this is Ross Geller's personal physician, Dr. Philange.
HEY, SHE'S FAST!! OKAY?!! Oh! You-you think you can be beat me? Let's go! Outside!!
No, not since I lost her at the airport.
I can't believe she can out run you man!
Hi!
Hey!
Okay. You know you probably didn't know this, but back in high school, I had a, um, major crush on you.
Split it?
Okay.
I knew.
You did! Oh.... I always figured you just thought I was Monica's geeky older brother.
How 'bout from now on we just call it the 'unfortunate incident'? Hey Gunther, you got stairs in your place?
Hey Rach. I, uh, got you a little present. . . I'll open it. It's a Slinky! Remember, huh. Walks down stairs, alone or in pairs, everyone knows it's. . . just a big spring. Alright, you still mad at me becuase of the whole. . .
Horrible and degrading list of reasons not to be with me?
Yeah.
Here, go nuts.
You are such a tattletale! Mom, Dad, you remember that-that time you walked in my room and smelled marijuana?
Mom! Dad! Ross smoked pot in college!
What?!
Yes.
Well I told you it was Chandler who was smoking the pot but it was me. I'm sorry.
Yes, professor Feesen-sen-stenlger... I'll be with you in one moment. So, I will take one box of the Thin Mints.
Yeah, we have time off and a lot of people are going on trips...
Professor Geller!
You don't understand! Elizabeth was about to ask me to go on a trip with her! Is that taking it slow?! No, I'm not ready for this! Okay? What-what do I tell her?
Just tell her the truth! Tell her you're not ready.
Look Rachel, I wanted to tell you, I thought I should, I-I did, and then Chandler and Joey convinced me not to.
Y'know what, I think we can go out there. I mean they have more important things to worry about.
Yeah, we'll be fine.
Wax the door shut, we're never leaving, ever.
Hi, it's Phoebe. Listen someone's gonna have to take my 9:00 with Mr. Rehack, 'cause it's like 9:15 now, and I'm not there.
So what, Joey? Wh-wh-what? What are you telling me? That there's nothing we can do? Well, how could this happen?!
Okay, well, we'll call the company that sent her!
I did that too! They wouldn't give me her real name or her number. They said, "If I bothered them again they'd call the police." I said, "If you talk to the police, you tell them I'm missing a ring!"
Look Ross, I am so-so sorry. I-I-I...
Well, what if we just ah, called her, used a fake name, and had her come to my office?
Well, can't you at least stall her a little? I'll-I'll go back to some of the places I went last night.
No! Hey! Hey! We can't!
Ross, she's gonna start getting ready soon!
All right, well how much time do you need?
Well how much time before she absolutely has to start getting ready?
Noo! No, not cuddlily, not me, just her. I'm like you, I need the room. Okay, come here. Okay, you're in bed...
Okay the sleeping thing. Very tricky business, but there is something you can do.
Well, I thought you guys were cuddlily sleepers.
Yeah.
I'm gonna use the cushion.
Everyday I am gonna do one thing that I haven't done before. That my friends is my New Year's resolution.
Just the one divorce in '99! Y'know what, I am gonna be happy this year. I am gonna make myself happy.
Do you want us to leave the room, or?
Ooh! That's a good one! Mine is to pilot a commercial jet.
That's good one too, Pheebs. Now all you have to do is find a planeload of people who's resolution is to plummet to their deaths.
Uh, lunch chef, purchasing, own little desk when Roland's not there. Here's to my little sister--
Newly appointed head lunch chef who is also in charge of purchasing--
Who has her own little desk when Roland's not there.
Oh, wait, and I got a beeper!
Cool.
No, Susans gonna be there too. Weve got dads, weve got lesbians, the whole parenting team.
Oh, and Ive got Earth Science, but I'll catch you in Gym.
So, is this just gonna be you and Carol?
Well, isnt, isnt that gonna be weird?
No, no. I mean, it mighta been at first, but by now I, I think I'm pretty comfortable with the whole situation.
Yeah. Op! Uh-oh! I think your Dad must've added wrong. He only tipped like four percent.
Okay!
Aw honey stop! It's not that bad.
Yeah. That's Daddy.
That's Daddy?! But doesn't it bother you? You're a waitress.
I am so over Janine. I mean, yeah, at first I thought she was hot, but now she's like OLD NEWS!
I know. And she's so sweet. I just wanna feed her grapes and brush her hair.
You are aware that she's not a monkey, right?
Hey guys!
Hi Janine!
Excuse me. Hi, I'm a professor here. Do you know the Paleontology section, fifth floor, stack 437?
Wait a minute! Why don't you guys do something?!
Yeah, look how that worked out.
Well, yes! Just give me five minutes, I just have to find someone to cover my shift.
No! No!! No! Can I speak to someone in charge please?!
Ahh, sorry, nothing you can do about it. It's one of my ah, rights as the ex-boyfriend. Oop, oh yeah!
Ah, I'm sorry.
Come on! I don't want you thinking of me like that any more!
Stop it! Cut it out! Cut it out!
Okay, okay, I'm sorry, it will never happen... Uh-oh! Wait a minute! Wait-wait, now there are a hundred of you and I'm the king.
Why?! Are there like bears or something?! Ohh. Oh, protection. Yeah-no, yeah-no, that-that-that I forgot.
Yeah.
Hey umm, you brought protection right?
I'll just run to the store and get some.
Oh no! Hey-hey, I'm the guy! I'll get it.
Yeah, I uh, totally forgot about that. You mind if I take a rain check? I'm waiting for a call from Emily.
For what?
For Stella! Remember? She's gettin' her grove back in like 20 minutes.
Sure. I guess. Hey, I hear you don't have to go to London. Yay!
It's not that easy, there's still a lot of relationship stuff.
Eww! No!! Her ear! All right, Monica categorizes her towels. How many categories are there?
Correct. In what part of her body did Monica get a pencil stuck at age 14?
Oh!
Everyday use.
Fancy.
Because I am bored...Out of my mind. I've already been to the bank, post office, and the dry cleaners.
I...Reorganized The Fridge. See, Bottom Shelf: Meats And Dairy. And Top Shelf expired products.
Why are you doing this?
Dude, you just described seven days worth of stuff. You've got to spread it out a little, you know. Haven't you ever been unemployed?
Hey, I am not unemployed. I'm on sabbatical!
That-that-that's all right, no honey, you take your time sweetie. I'll be right out here. She's just fixing her makeup.
You've spoiled everything! It's like a nightmare! My friends and family are out there! How can I face them?! How can you do this to me?!
Hey, no matter what happens with Ross and Emily, we still get cake right?
I hate you!!
And, I love you!!
It wasn't so much a party as...a gathering of people, with food, and music, and, and the band.
You know, a party, or--
What party?
You partied with Hootie and the Blowfish?
Yes, apparently Stevie and the band are like this.
: Could you take it to Carol's every now and then, and show it to Ben, just so he doesn't forget me?
Yeah, i-it's for the museum. Someone found a bone, we want the bone, but they don't want us to have the bone, so I'm going over there to try to persuade them to give us the boit'sit's a whole big bone thing. Anyway, I'm gonna be gone for like, uh... like a week, so, uh, if you wanna reach me, y-you can't. So here's my itinerary . Um... here's a picture of me...
Oh, let me see!
Yeah.
Hi, Ben. I'm your father. I am... the head. Aaaaaahhhh.... Alright, this barbecue is gonna be very fun.
Wow, couples who live together do start to look alike. So, Mondler...uh, what uh, what 'cha doin?
Please Rachel, I am not an idiot.
No, wait Phoebe.
What does it look like I'm doing? I am cleaning!
Did you get Monica's authorization to move all of her stuff?
Fun? Where was the fun? Tell me specifically, which part was the fun part? Where's my puck?
Oh, that's attractive.
Oh, I thought you were great in Silence of the Lambs. Oh come on, admit it! All things considered, you had fun tonight.
Oh, ah- the kid has it.
The kid...? Excuse me, uh, that's, that's my puck.
Yeah, well excuse me for wanting to be with my girlfriend on our anniversary, boy what an ass am I.
For what? For letting you throw me out of your office?
You had no right coming down to my office Ross. You do not bring a picnic basket to somebody's work! Unless maybe they were a park ranger!
But I told you, I didn't have the time!
Yeah, well you never have the time. I mean, I don't feel like I even have a girlfriend anymore, Rachel.
...and these come in the shapes of your favourite Christmas characters, Santa, Rudolph, and Baby Jesus.
Why, do I have a feeling that's not as happy as it sounds? No! Nooooo!!!
Hey! Hey!!
All right, I'll take a box of the cream filled Jesus's.
Wait a minute, one box! Come on, I'm trying to send a little girl to Spacecamp, I'm putting you down for five boxes. Chandler, what about you?
Aww, Pheeb, come on isn't there any relative that would have the recipe? What about, what about your sister?
Oh yeah-No, she was really nice to me, but she's in hell for sure.
Well, I've tried everything. I give up. I guess I'm not gonna be the mom who makes the world's best chocolate cookies. I do make the best duck confit with broccoli rabe. Kids love that right.
Oh no-no, no, I made a promise to myself that the next time I would talk to Ursula would be over my dead body. And that's not happening 'til October 15th, 2032.
That's the day you're gonna die? See-darnit, I've got shuffleboard that day.
No, no you don't understand the animal hospital is way across town he's choking I don't know what else to do.
You've got to help me my monkey swallowed a 'K'!
You go get that animal outta here.
What's goin' on?
Marcel swallowed a Scrabble tile.
Oh, Emily that is, that is so great. It's gonna be so great! We're gonna be like-like-like two idiots in love!
All right, did you just say all right?
I did. Now I'm the idiot.
Ross, there's one thing that really scares me still.
Yes, tell me.
It's just, my part seemed to be over pretty quickly and then, and then there was a lot of waiting around.
Huh. But still Ross, you're worst day with two women, pretty much better than any other day! Y'know what I mean?
Oh-oh, absolutely!
But you got to be with both of them, right?
Not-not really. Th-th-there was just Carol.
No! But we-we didn't have...sex-uh, did we? I mean, I don't remember much about last night, it was such a blur.
Yeah.
Really?!
Oh! I remember laughing! I laughed a lot.
And we didn't have sex.
Joey's asking if you've just ruined the first book he's ever loved that didn't star Jack Nicholson?
No, Beth doesn't die, she doesn't die. Does she Rachel?
What?!
No. She doesn't die.
Then why would you say that?!
Alright, alright, maybe it'll take my mind off it. Do you promise to buy me a big thumb finger?
I have no idea.
C'mon, Ross!
You got it.
Look-look-look-look-look, my first pay check! Look at the window, there's my name! Hi, me!
Well I'm sorry, I think about stuff. Ya know, I mean, you're at work, you're assembling bones, your mind wanders.
Ok, what the hell happened back there?
I don't know, you tell me. One minute I'm holding Ben like a football, the next thing I know, I've got two kids, I'm living in Scarsdale complaining about the taxes.
Ross, you have planned out the next 20 years of our lives, we've been dating for six weeks.
C'mon, what, you never think about our future?
No! I made it seem like I was just calling to chat. Pretty sure, they both think I'm interested in them.
No! I talked to Joey on the set, he hasn't heard from him. I-I-I talked to Chandler's parents again!
You told them he was missing?
All right, we've got to tell her he's gone.
No! Hey! Hey! We can't!
Okay. I can, I can see that. Umm, but I think if you give me umm, one chance I can, I can change your mind.
That's funny. Umm.... It's not funny.
I don't like you going out with my daughter Ross.
Okay.
What?
All right, it's time for the story of Hanukkah. Years and years ago, there were these people called the Maccabees.
Well, I'll stay, but only because I wanna hear about Hanukkah. Ben, will you sit here with Santa and learn about Hanukkah?
Okay, Santa!
Merry Christmas!
Oh wow! Look at this place!
Yeah, c'mon I mean I though, you know, I thought we're just foolin' around. Like when, uh, when we were kids.
Why, why, why can't you stand me being here? I don't, I, we're just, ya know, we're just havin' fun.
Fun? Fun, you think this is fun?
Ross, I hated you when we were kids.
You hated me when we were kids?
Really? No. I mean, nah, I haven't played in so long, and-and, well it's-it's really personal stuff, y'know?
He used to lock himself in the basement for hours. No one was every allowed to hear, "The Sound."
I wanna hear "The Sound."
Come on, play that funky music white boy.
Yeah!
That does make sense. Because I do wanna seize some opportunity, but I-I really don't wanna see or talk to her.
Huh.
I mean, look-look today you escaped death, y'know? And maybe this is a chance for you to escape getting back together with Emily?
Well, there you go!
Yeah. Maybe today is just, close call day.
The Armadillo was actually not so thrilled about that part! Okay Ben, it's time to light the Hanukkah candles!
Yeah?
My favorite part was when Superman flew all the Jews out of Egypt.
Hey!
Oh.
Come on sweetie! You've had to work late every night for the past two weeks, what is it this time?
What?
I can get a quick bite to eat, but then I have to come back up here.
Actually, it's kinda my fault. I-I quit today.
But work comes first! Oh hey, but that's sad about you though, what happened? Burn out? Burn all out, did ya?
Oh hey, don't thank me, thank yourself. You're the one who faced her fears and ultimately overcame them.
Oh yeah, sorry about that. Mob mentality or whatever, I don't know...
I can't believe it! I did it! I rode a bike! I never thought I'd be able to do that! Thank you Ross.
Don't be so corny Ross, it's not an after-school special.
Buh-bye. I just got us reservations at Michelle's and tickets to the Musicman to celebrate our first holiday season as a betroughed couple.
Well, why don't you just start with something simple. Like umm, Monica from the moment I met you, I knew I loved you.
Those are my eyes! Those are my breasts.
Oh! Yeah!
Yeah, I'm not sure I can do that.
...everyone, this is Chandler!
Gunther. Hey-hey! Why don't we put them on? Y'know get a picture of Batman and James Bond together.
Yes. I find it to be something of a conversation piece.
Between you and...
I would but mine doesn't fit. The pants are a little tight.
A little tight? I could see double-oh and seven in those pants.
Uh, Rachel, I've been thinking. I don't think us getting together tonight is such a good idea. I'm calling it off.
I swear, I never wanted any part of your night!
Oh, is that why you did it the secret hallway where nobody ever goes?!
Why to save your dignity my man.
Monica, why? Why would I ever want to take away from your night?
Wow, I haven't seen her for like forever. I wonder if she still carries that Barbie everywhere she goes.
Cassie?
Uh-hmm.
Ross, she's 25 years old.
So what! I still have-No you're probably right.
Why, why, why can't you stand me being here? I don't, I, we're just, ya know, we're just havin' fun.
Ow, ow, OK. Alright, alright, Mon, Mon, you've gone ultrasonic again, alright.
I just can't stand you being here all the time.
Fun? Fun, you think this is fun?
Yeah, c'mon I mean I though, you know, I thought we're just foolin' around. Like when, uh, when we were kids.
Look, I don't wanna make any trouble, okay, but I'm in a lot of pain here, alright? My face is dented.
Listen, it's kind of an emergency. Well, I guess you know that, or we'd be in the predicament room.
Hold on. Fill these out, sit over there.
Well, you'll have to wait your turn.
Well, how long do you think it'll be?
Hi! Yeah! Tommy's in line for the bathroom and someone just cut in front of him, I think he's gonna snap.
Could I borrow it?
Hi! Remember me?
Ross, I'm gonna go.
Go? Why?
You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now.
Yeah. Yeah. A little.
Well, I was just wondering about the mother-to-be, but.. thanks for sharing. Uh, lie back..
Oh my God.
Look at that.
Oh, but-but it is, uh, it's just like the first Thanksgiving, when the Indians and the Pilgrims uh, sat down to dinner.
You're not gonna go anywhere, you said you were gonna eat here, and you're gonna eat here!
Yeah, and-and leaving us to go see hot dancer girls is not very Thanksgivingy.
Yeah, yeah, and the Indians taught the Pilgrims what it meant to be hot in the new world!
Hello everybody!
The most amazing thing happened tonight. I thought my number was up. I had an actual near death experience!
Y'know, it-it doesn't matter. The important thing is that you're here. You're my friend, and you're here. Oh!
Okay, just a little scared. What's going on Ross?
What?! What? What happened?!
Okay, okay, we were on the ride along with Gary, right?
Well, I uh, I can't seem to find the monkey I donated last year. He's a capuchan, answers to the name Marcel.
Erica.
Hi, Dean Lipson, zoo administrator. I was told you had a question.
Ahh, I'm afraid I have some bad news. Marcel has passed on.
Oh my God, what happened?
So uh, Rach? Does it, does it feel weird around here now? Y'know since I've been away at college.
Well, as long as the pilgrims didn't eat it, I'm in.
dammit!
Oh! No, not really.
Well, that's cool. So did...
There's my boy! Here's my boy! And here's his Barbi What's ah, what's my boy doing with a Barbi?
Oh, now you want a pad.
Hey!!
He picked it out of the toy store himself, he loves it.
He carries it everywhere, it's like a security blanket, but with ski boots and a kicky beret.
Wow, Monica's letting other people help decorate her tree! Did someone get her drunk again or?
Hey
Hey
Having a perfectly decorated tree is not what Christmas is about. It's about being with the people that you love.
That is nice and we're done. TADA!
Nope. I mean, I know Susan does every year, but I think I wanna take this year to teach him all about Hanukkah.
Ohh! That's great!
Are you gonna dress up as Santa?
And maybe I could teach Ben about the Christmas skull and how people die.
You may need to use this year to teach Ben about Phoebe.
All right here. Watch me execute the three 'P's of championship play. Power. Precision. and penache.
Shielding your face and shrieking like a girl... is not a backhand.
I was shrieking... like a Marine.
You broke a little girl's leg?!!
I know. I feel horrible. Okay.
You are not putting that on again! Marcel, OKif you press that button, you are in very, very big trouble.
Um.... no. See, I might've had feelings for her at one timenot any more. I justI...
Marcel! Where are you going with that disc?
Can you believe what a jerk Ross was being?
Yeah, I know. He can get really competitive.
That may be the most depressing thing I've heard in my life. I should probably get these to my lawyer's office.
Did I, did I even treat?
No, it was on the house, it was, it was a newlywed special.
Hey, thanks Ross, for taking care of all of this.
Eh, no problem.
I got some, uh, hers and hers towels for Susan and Carol. And, uh, I got this blouse for mom.
OK. OK, this is a picture frame from Ben to my parents, huh.
Cute.
Ross, that is gorgeous!
Yeah?
Look, it's just did, did you ever go to a party and think, "Would really anyone miss me if I weren't here?"
It was, it was okay.
Just okay-Did you do it right?!
Huh. But still Ross, you're worst day with two women, pretty much better than any other day! Y'know what I mean?
Oh-oh, absolutely!
Oh what?! Is she gonna cancel on me again?! How can she do this? Doesn't she know it's our anniversary?
What is ah, Rach in her room?
Oh no, she's still at work, but she told me to tell you to call her.
All right ah, Ross, this is the extent of my knowledge on the subject. Call Rachel.
What's that on the bottom?
Get him! GET HIM! Get him! Get- YESSS! Not laughing now, are ya pal!
Oh, well... 'cause.... you just... I don't like this question.
Okay, see, see, you guys, what if we don't get magic beans? I mean, what if all we've got are.. beans?
See buddy, that's all you need, a bunch of toothless guys hitting each other with sticks.
Pass it! Pass it!
Hey! Yeah-yeah, we're just having dinner. Uh, yeah, sure uh hold on. She wants to say hi. Hold on.
It's almost as if he knew.
I'll get it. Hello. Hi Emily! Yeah, uh you-you tracked him down. Hold on one second.
Hi Emily!
Hi!
Okay, if you'll excuse me, I-I'm gonna go hang out with some people who don't know the Space Mountain story.
And! We should keep all the stuff uh, we told each other secret from everybody else.
Yeah, definitely!
Then, I'd steer clear of Phoebe.
Man!
No, no. I mean, it mighta been at first, but by now I, I think I'm pretty comfortable with the whole situation.
No, Susans gonna be there too. Weve got dads, weve got lesbians, the whole parenting team.
Well, isnt, isnt that gonna be weird?
Ross, thats my jacket.
I know.
Oh God, thank you! Umm, uh, Mr. Stevens I'd like you to meet my friends uh, this is Phoebe, Monica, and Chandler.
Ross!
How crazy that we'd run into you!
You're Elizabeth's father, huh? I can see now where she gets her rugged handsomeness.
Is-is-is there a-a Mrs. Stevens?
Well we did it, we're here. We are standing our ground. How long does a cup of coffee take?
Yeah hey, you know if you want I can take you around back and show you where he hit his head on the rain gutter.
Ok.
Would you come on! Come on! Thank you.
Ah, there we go.
Uh-hmm, yeah-yeah do you like it? Do-do you looove it? I just want you to know that I'm changing your grade back.
Uh Mr. Morse, can I speak to you for a moment?
That was a great lecture today. Did you get a little hair cut?
What?! Why?
'Cause I know what you're trying to pull here. Okay? It's not gonna work.
Well with Carol, I promised never to love another woman until the day I die. She made no such promise.
Monica, there are no words... There are no words! This should not be this hard!
All right, uh... Oh hey, you've done this before Ross, well what did you say when you made up your vows?
I'm so pathetic! Monica knows what she wants to say! You should've seen her. Writing, writing, writing!
Monica what?
What? No! No! I am not gonna hide it from Phoebe-Ooh, although I did get some great Pottery Barn sheets!
She hates Pottery Barn?!!
I know! I know, she says it's all mass-produced, nothing is authentic, and everyone winds up having the same stuff. So come on, she's gonna be here any second! Can we please just cover this up with something?! Please?
Ooo! Oh, I forgot they made sheets!
Uh, yeah! I still can't believe she hates Pottery Barn!
Thank you. C'mon, Marcel, whaddya say you and I do a little mingling? Alright, I'll, uh... catch up with you later.
Okay. He was more embarrassed about that than anyone. Okay? And for him to have the courage to walk back in here like nothing happened...
Alright. Just keep him away from me.
Oh my gosh! Rachel, honey.. are you okay? Where-where's Paolo?
Rome. Jerk missed his flight.
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la! Okay, okay, yeah, I would have been devastated but, I would still want to be with you. Because it's, I mean it's you.
Yes.
You knew that our hot, sweaty, writhing bodies were....
Ohhhhh!
What? Come on Rach, tell me what you're thinking?
Well, I think it's perfect. Y'know, it's just gonna be the two of us, she spent all day taking care of my monkey...
Well, I added the 'exactly like me' part... But she said she's looking for someone, and someone is gonna be there tonight.
'Tonight' tonight?
I can't remember the last time I got a girl to take care of my monkey.
Anyway, I figured after work I'd go pick up a bottle of wine, go over there and, uh, try to woo her.
I'm-I'm not kidding. Look I-I, I can't have three failed marriages. I can't. Okay? I-I am not gonna be that guy!
Wow! This is so amazing. I uh, I really thought I'd have to talk you into this more.
Okay, see now I'm scared because I don't actually think you're kidding.
What-wh-what so we'll just stay married forever?!
Okay, look, how is this gonna affect you? Really? I mean you fill some form out once and a while and instead of checking the box that says Ms you check the box that says Mrs.! It's right next to it!
This is fun. Hey Rach, remember that whole "We were on a break thing?" Well, I'm sorry, will you marry me?
Okay, how long is this going to go on.
Well I think the length of teasing is directly related to how insane you were so, a long time.
That's not funny.
That's not funny at all!
Yes, it was horrible. She cried. I cried. She threw things, they hit me. Anyway, I did the right thing.
I'm telling you this thing won't print. Yes, I pressed that button like 100 times. You know, for a hot line you are not so hot. What? What is that in the background? Are you watching Star Trek?
Hey, so how'd it go with Julie? Did you, did you break her heart?
So, Spock actually hugs his father?
Hey, do you guys have... ...hi.
'Kay, wait a minute, are you sure she didn't say "When are you gonna grow up and realise I am your mom?"
Wow!
Then she came back with "The question is, when are you gonna grow up and realise I have a bomb?"
That makes more sense.
So, what's going on now?
You tell, of course you do. Issac. Issac. Hey, Issac. Issac, hi! Y'know we haven't actually met...
Exactly. So you didn't, didn't mention anything to Issac right?
Oh, well I tell Issac everything.
You dog!
Yes, I suppose I am a dog. But Issac, see I-I happen to have a girlfriend.
No, Rach, no. I don't, I don't, I don't have to think about it, in fact, I've decided, I've decided that, that it.......does.
Does it? Does it? Yeah, I wanted to give that whole 'Does it?' part just another glance.
What are you talking about, Ross, you just said that you read it twice! Look, y'know what, either it does or it doesn't, and if you have to even think about it...
Are you sure?
Oh, sure! I'm sure.
Hi! I'm sorry, but can you give me a second while I talk to this woman, who by the way did not spend the night.
Yep. Okay.
Kyle's ex-wife? You were supposed to divert her not date her!
Sure.
Okay. I did divert her and we ended up having a great time! Okay?
Thanks Aunt Pheebs. Hey, you didn't microwave that, did you, because it's breast milk, and you're not supposed to do that.
Yes. Uh, yes, I did. That was my friend, Eddie Moskowitz. Yeah, he likes it. Reaffirms his faith.
Ben, dinner!
Duh, I think I know how to heat breast milk. Ok.
What did you just do?
Alright, alright, here's the chance. Monica give him cash, Rachel give him your earrings. Something, now, anything.
Oh, yeah, well hey, welcome to our sauna.
Ahh, is it hot? My body always stays cool, probably 'cause I have so much skin. Hey, cheese!
No, I will not cave.
Yeah, I'm with Mon.
Yeah, I mean... I think when it's your shot, y'know, you-you know it's your shot. Did it... feel like your shot..?
Y'know, I've done nothing but crappy plays for six years. And I finally get my shot, and I blow it!
Maybe this wasn't your shot.
Hard to tell, I was naked.
No, I don't think this was your shot. I mean, I don't even think you just get one shot. I really believe big things are gonna happen for you, I do! You've gotta just keep thinking about the day that some kid is gonna run up to his friends and go 'I got the part! I got the part! I'm gonna be Joey Tribbiani's ass!'.
Hey, I think Elizabeth is a little more serious than, "Spring break!" All right? I mean she's taken my class!
I went to Egypt with my dad.
I can see it now, "Look dad, it's the Sphinx!"
And slept with the professor.
I'm gonna call her.
Yeeeeeep... Yep-yep-yep-yep-yep. I remember when she took out on her dad's boat she wouldn't let me help at all.
What? I was just trying to teach you.
Well, lesson learned! Rachel is mean!
Excuse me, I wanted you to help, but you couldn't move your arms because you were wearing three life jackets.
You have to respect the sea!
Oh! Oh-oh, the band's ready! Well, I-I-we gotta do what the band says-I don't care about the stupid band!!
But it absolutely didn't. It didn't!! It didn't!!
Ross, hey, the band's ready outside for your first dance with Emily, so...
You spit on me man!
Look, I'm sorry.
You're never gonna believe it uh, Monica and Chandler are moving in again. That's great news right-I mean for them. Right?
Hey Rach!
Hi!
Oh wow.
Yeah but, on the bright side, we get to be roommates again.
Let me see, I gotta see, I gotta see. Oh, a head. Oh, it's, it's huge. Carol, how are you doing this?
Out!
All right, he's crowning. Here he comes.
Not.... helping!
You're doing great, you're doing fine.
Yeah, he-he's right, he's right. This is your time y'know, yeah, you're young, you're-you're weird, chicks dig that.
What, you don't think I know that?
Look, the point is, there's a lot of women out there you haven't even had sex with yet!
Okay, but isn't sex better when it's with one person that you really, really care about.
Yeah, in a poem maybe.
Yeah, hey I-I have clothes, I even pick them out. I mean for, for all you know I could be a fashion..... monger.
Pa-haa!! I would love to go with you.
Really!?
Okay. Honey, I would love for you to go with me. What?
What should I wear, now I'm all nervous.
I found a note on my door, "Come to Monica's quick, bring champagne and a Three Musketeers bar."
Hey, what's going on?
Hey.
Yeah I'll take that.
What's up?
We'll each tell you how we came up with the joke and then you decide which one of us is telling the truth-me.
Yeah, but I'm your brother. We're family. That's the most important thing in the world.
Don't try to sway her. I'm your only chance to have a baby. Okay, let's go.
Okay, Chandler, you go first.
Okay, I thought of the joke two months ago at lunch with Steve.
Are you sure? Because I can stay out as late as you want. I told you how I'm on sabbatical from work, right?
Thanks!
Actually, I should get going.
Yes! Yes! You did!
Oh...
But we haven't seen each other since then. Well I land in China, guess who's in charge of the dig.
This is amazing. I mean, how, how did this happen?
Well, Ross and I were in grad school together.
Julie! Julie, isn't that great? I mean, isn't that just kick-you-in-the-crotch, spit-on-your-neck fantastic?
It's an expression.
Well, this was fun. Uh, we should really do it again sometime, wha'dya say? Ok. Alright so I've got him.
Ok, this could go on for a while.
We've got a cab waiting downstairs.
Tuesday.
Tuesday right. Ok, bye you guys.
Hey Pheebs, maybe this whole heart attack thing is a sign, that-that you should start think about getting a different job.
What are you two girls whispering about over there?!
But I think we should tell her.
Okay, what is this? A stupid contest? Because we got a winner here!
Listen Phoebe, he's right. People are not supposed to have heart attacks at 31.
Ok, ok, ok, ok, here goes. You know, I, you know, can't do this. Uh, this is too weird. I feel stupid.
Ok, ok, here we go. Ok, where am I talking to, here? I mean, uh, well, there is one way that seems to offer a certain acoustical advantage, but...
Just aim for the bump.
So don't do it, it's fine. You don't have to do it just because Susan does it.
Hello, baby. Hello, hello.
Bye Marcel. See ya on the big screen. You keep people drinkin' that beer, OK. I miss you buddy.
But no. Maybe if I were baking.
Bye-bye.
You know, I think I want to write a song about all this.
Oh yeah.
Phoebe! I can't believe you gave them money! I thought you agreed it was totally unreasonable that they asked me for that money!
You chipped in?!
Yeah, uh-huh, a 100 dollars.
Yeah, but they didn't ask me! Y'know? This way I'm just y'know, the exotic, generous stranger. That's always fun to be.
Yeah, but you're making me look bad!
Little louder, okay, I think there's a man on the twelfth floor in a coma that didn't quite hear you...
Look, it's just a little more complicated...
Well, what? What? What is it? That she left you? That she likes women? That she left you for another woman that likes women?
Then what?
My first time with Carol was...
...and the miracle was that that little bit of oil that should've just lasted just one day, burned for...
I know. Oh-oh, wait did you hear that-hear that? Listen, I'm gettin' something from your grandmother, she said that since you get to keep the one bedroom apartment you should give Rachel the purple chair?
No, I do not hear that.
Eight whole days.
That's right, and that's why we celebrate Hanukkah today. The end.
No-no-no, it's just a bit sudden. No, it's great. Okay? I'm totally on board. I love you too, all righty. Bye.
Ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah! Enh? All right, what do you think?
You're on in 5 Ms. Minnelli.
What's the matter Ross?
Nothing. Oh, actually, great news! I just got off the phone with Emily and it looks like I'm moving to a new apartment. Woo-hoo!
Then, uh, then we got dressed, and I-I... I walked her to the- -the bus stop... I'm fine.
Actually, nectarines, but basically...
Could've been a peach.
Hey, that woman's got an ass like Carol's! What? Thought we were trying to find stuff.
So c'mon, you guys, tell me all the dirt!
All right, all right, it's just that you left a red sock in with all your whites, and now, everything's kinda pink.
Nothing, nothing. Lee-lo, the laundry's done.
Come on, show me.
Oh, everything's pink.
Yeah, uh, except for the red sock, which is still red. I'm sorry, please don't be upset, it could happen to anyone.
Okay when you're playing a machine and it hasn't paid out, a lurker waits for you to give up and then...
What? No-no, a lurker.
Oh. What's a lurker?
Kills you?
No. They swoop in and steal your jackpot.
Come on, I think this is a good thing. I don't think Mom would've hired you if she didn't think you were good at what you do.
How come?
Because I need the money, and I thought that it'd be a great way to get rid of that last little schmidgen of self-respect.
You don't have to stick up for her. She can't here you.
Hey! Umm, do you guys have any juice?
Fine! Y'know what? It doesn't matter, because, if I remember correctly, there is a comb on the floor of the bathroom.
No way!
Well no brush!
Alimony.
Chandler, we still haven't gotten an RSVP from your dad.
Hey, you wanna get something to eat or uh, do you wanna see how long we can throw this ball back and forth? Huh?
It's not a cat!
Ugh! Look you guys, I'm really excited about this! Okay? I don't care what you think! I'm gonna go set up a little litter box for Mrs. Whiskerson. Well, what am I gonna call her? Fluffy?!
Uhh, the ball thing.
Yeah?
Huh. Well, good luck to Dad. Say, how many more boxes would you have to sell in order to win?
I think you would have to clean a whole lot of apartments to go all the way to India.
No. The one in Atlantic City, Dad loves the slots. He says he's gonna double the college money my Grandma left me.
The girl who won last year sold four hundred and seventy-five.
Yeah.
Of course not, it smells like wine, which you spilled! And thanks for wrecking my sheet by the way.
Oh yes.
Well this doesn't even smell like opium.
Oh Ross, calm down, I'll give you the 80 cents.
Okay, one more time.
Look, I know what you're going through. When I turned 50 I got the Porsche. You... you got your own little speedster.
Ahh, what's a little mid-life crisis between friends?
Jack, would you let it go?
Guys. Seriously, it is not like that.
Tell you what, maybe one of these weekends you can borrow the car and I cou. . .
Okay. Ben? Come here. All right, I'm gonna leave you here with Aunt Rachel for about an hour. Okay? Are you gonna be okay?
I don't know! Just-just talk to him-entertain him and keep him alive.
Okay.
Yeah I think so.
I wasn't talking to you.
Hey, both you guys should be up there with me. I mean, you two are-are my... I mean, I'm lucky to have just one good...
Really?
Really?
Thanks man.
I gotta go check something over here.
Y'see, that's where you're wrong. Why would I marry her if I thought on any level thatthat she was a lesbian?
Oh, it's nothing, it's a little thing... I hate that guy.
What, so he was a little analytical. That's what he does, y'know? C'mon, he's not that bad.
I dunno. Maybe you wanted your marriage to fail.
Why? Why would I why? Why? Why? Why?
And then, like three days in a row he got to the newspaper before I did, and peed all over the crossword.
I dont know whether hes testing me, or just acting out, but my monkey is out of control. But, he keeps erasing the messages on my machine, "supposedly" by accident.
No, yeah, Ive done that.
Ive never done that.
All right, now look at her and tell me she doesnt look exactly like her sister.
Um. I know it says black tie optional, but, um this may be pushing it a little, um.
They got a phone in there, right?
Okay, we're on it. We're on it.
I'm not gonna gooo.
You're not going to go.
Thanks, Dad, really, I ju... you know, I just, I just needed to know, um... when did you start to feel like a father?
No, no, Dad, I was just wondering.
'Cause there's time to make up for that. We can do stuff together. You always wanted to go to that Colonial Williamsburg. How 'bout we do that?
Oh, well, I, I guess it musta been the day after you were born. We were in the hospital room, your mother was asleep, and they brought you in and gave you to me. You were this ugly little red thing, and all of a sudden you grabbed my finger with your whole fist. And you squeezed it, so tight. And that's when I knew.
So you don't wanna go to Williamsburg?
And the reason I'm doing this is because I am Joey's friend. And if you were a good friend, you'd be doing the same thing.
I am not unemployed. I'm on sabbatical!
Come on look guys, don't fight.
Oh, so being a good friend means acting like a total jerk?
If it does? Then you're an amazing friend of mine.
I picked up the divorce papers. Uh, I've already signed everything and I put little 'X's where you need to sign.
Phoebe, would you take a look at this mess!!!!
Oh honey thank God you're home, I was getting worried.
Oh, little 'X's! Great! That makes up for everything!
Y'know, I-I-you've done a lot of stupid stuff too! Okay?
Yeah, which, which we have to leave for in exactly twelve minutes. All right, come on, I'll just pick something out for you.
You don't, you don't know what your wearing?
Well, hon-ey. I'm just trying to look nice for your big night.
All right, you will notice that I am fully dressed. I, in turn, have noticed that you are not. So in the words of A. A. Milne, "Get out of my chair, dillhole!"
Okay.
No. No. No, I'm-I'm glad you did. Look, if nothing else, it's-it's always great when someone tells you they love you.
That is what the thing is.
Ross, things aren't gonna be weird between us, right? I mean was that just the stupidest thing, me telling you that?
That's what I said! Thank you for being so nice.
No thank you for... Thank you.
Okay? But-but imagine a lot more lights, okay? And-and y'know fewer bricks, and-and-and flowers, and candles...
I tell you, this wedding is not going to happen.
Oh God.
And the musicians, look, they can go over here , okay? And the chairs can face this way , and... You go.
But-but, if you don't love this, we'll do it in any other place at any other time. Really, it's fine, whatever you want.
Can you please not do that feet first? You know where his injury is! Severed toe, you just said it!
What do we got here?
Twenty year old has got a severed toe on his right foot.
It says here that the knife went right through your shoe.
Of course it did. They're made of wicker.
And that should conclusively prove that I had the idea for Jurassic Park first! Now let's take a look at...
This baby has got everything. Take y'know, locations for instance. First, organized alphabetically, then geographically, then by square footage.
That is so smart! Break it off. Break it off now.
Hey! Ross!
Phoebe, oh my God! Wh-wh-what are you doing here?
Oh, they'll like me. Once they come to my awesome PAR-TAY! Okay, I gotta run. I gotta go get some nametags.
It doesn't matter! It's my principles! We're talking about my principles!
Okay, I thought it was about your neighbors liking you.
And that crazy party animal will be your brother-in-law.
Very, very funny, but don't say things like that in front of Monica. I don't want you putting any ideas in her head.
Well, that's because you're such a sweet, gentle, uh...Do you, uh, do you...Oh, hey, uh you must need detergent.
All right, show's over. Nothing to see here. Ok, let's do laundry.
That was amazing. I can't even send back soup.
What's that?
Uberveiss. It's new, it's German, it's extra-tough.
Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done.
And you knew about this?!
Your folks are really that bad, huh?
Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- -I'd want yours.
Must pee.
No. Your mother really did the work. I was busy with the business. I wasn't around that much. Is that what this is about?
I'm not freaking out, I'm just saying, if somebody had come to me with the idea andndash;
Dad, dad, dad, I'm talkin' about the whole uh, baby thing. Did you uh, ever get this sort of... panicky, "Oh my god I'm gonna be a father" kind of a thing?
No, no, Dad, I was just wondering.
'Cause there's time to make up for that. We can do stuff together. You always wanted to go to that Colonial Williamsburg. How 'bout we do that?
Yeah, just a little in high school, but then I really got into it in college. I mean that's-that's when I really found my sound.
Well umm, y'know, I used to play.
Oh yeah, that's right, the keyboards, huh?
Oh God! Orange juice just came out of my nose, but it was totally worth it. Oh my God, I completely forgot about your sound.
Yeah.
Okay, that's right, yes, but on Hanukkah, uh, we sing, uh Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, I made you out of clay.
Right, um, but, on Hanukkah, Hanukkah is a celebration of a miracle. See, years and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees.
Jingle bells, jingle bells...
Rudolph, the red-nosed reindeer...
Okay, it's not a contest.
ALL RIGHT!! Phoebe now come on! Will you please tell me what it is I did that mad you so mad at me!
All right. I'll uh, I'll see you later, okay?
Bye, fat ass.
I don't know! I don't remember!
Well if you can't remember, can't we just forget about this?
This is helping your career?! Huh? I thought you wanted to be an actor not the creator of crazy lawsuit game!
Yeah, that's the uh, game we were playing.
Oh yeah, it's great! See you take a tennis ball, a bowl, and some lighter fluid-Op! Op!
You're right, you're right, I'll get back to work.
And shame on you! You should know better, Joey needs to work. Now come on!
Look I've already looked at like a thousand apartments this month and none of them even compares to that one!
Oh Ross, honey you gotta stop torturing yourself!
Yeah, why don't you just find another apartment?
Y'know what you should do?
Huh?
Yeah. Yeah, oh you loved that thing. You always had it with you. You never went anywhere without-without that coloring book.
Well, these. These are yours right here.
Okay. Oh! A coloring book!
Really? Wow! It looks like I had some trouble staying inside the lines.
Nu-uh!
Hey, y'know if you want to pick up some extra cash? Some friends of mine made good money doing telemarketing.
That was me and Ross.
Oh that's right!
Oh that's a great idea. You're really good on the phone.
Yeah and yeah, and it would probably be better than the last telephone job I had. Y'know, I probably wouldn't have to say spank as much.
Yeah, see Mon, listen, listen. When Carol and I broke up, I went through the same thing. And you know what I did?
What if it's new? I mean, we agreed not to talk again, unless we had something really important to say. Shouldn't I call him back?
Honey, you did call him back. 'Cause, it's, it's really old.
Huh?
I.....got.....dressed. Really, really quickly. Okay, okay. There we go, there we go.
That's funny, that, no, because, uh, our parents actually did, uh, send our dog off to live on a farm.
Yeah. Cushions the blow.
Yeah, it's like when you're a kid, and your parents put your dog to sleep, and they tell you it went off to live on some farm.
Uh, Ross.
What? Wh- hello? The Millners' farm in Connecticut? The Millners, they had this unbelievable farm, they had horses, and, and rabbits that he could chase and it was- it w- .....Oh my God, Chi Chi!
Oh great! That means I'm stuck with, "So, we were watching you in there and you were sittin' right here! Whoa!"
Ohh no you don't! You got lighting last time, lighting is mine!
And I have costumes.
What are you gonna do Pheebs?
I don't know. I don't know. I can't lie to him again. Oh no I-no! I'm just gonna press my breasts up against him.
Wait! Wait! Wait! Y'know what? Just stay. Please? It uh... It would really mean a lot to me if you stayed.
No! Why?
Come on you guys! Listen, if Emily knew I was here having dinner you with you she would flip out and you know it. It's okay, I really... I don't mind.
Ross, I...
RACHEL PLEASE!!! JUST HAVE DINNER WITH US!!!
I know. I know. I mean, one day, he's this little thing, and before you know it, he's this little thing I can't get off my leg.
I can't believe it, Ross. This sucks!
I don't get it, I mean, you just got him. How can he be an adult already?
Isn't there any way you can keep him?
No, no. The vet says unless he's in a place where he has regular access to some... monkey lovin,' he's just gonna get vicious. I've just gotta get him into a zoo.
Monica had such a crush on him. Yeah, she used to kiss his poster every night before she went to bed.
Okay. Come on! That's not running! Let's go!
You guys, I'm telling you, when she runs, she looks like a cross between Kermit The Frog and The Six Million Dollar Man.
Oh! I used to do that too!
Did you also have his album, It's Not Easy Being Green?
Oh, I just thought we could go out to dinner, and then maybe bring her back to my place and I'd introduce her to my monkey.
Her name is Celia. She's not a bug lady. She's curator of insects at the museum.
So what are you guys going to do?
And he's not speaking metaphorically.
So.... back to your place...you thinking, maybe... huh-huh?
Laugh it up, but the joke's on you. Because we don't need to get divorced, okay? We we're just gonna get an annulment.
Well, I guess we just find a divorce lawyer?
Well, I think, I think, Ross already has one. Now, this one's free, right? Because you paid for the first two, so the third one's free.
An annulment? Ross! I don't think surgery's the answer here.
Oh-oh, that's your thing.
Oh wow! I mean, wow! I mean, I-I-I think she's cute but I-I would never have thought of going out with her, never!
Did you tell your sister to ask me out?
Well yeah...
Really?!
Yeah but after you said it was okay, I figured, "Why not?!"
Hey! I just spoke to your dad, and you know what? He seems to think we'll be able to find a new place for the wedding.
How you doin'? Joey Tribbiani, America.
Hello?
We don't have to.
Whoa-whoa-what? You found a place?
No, please, please, um, it's for a poor little girl who wants to go to Spacecamp more than anything in the world.
Ah, well, it means that I can sell cookies, but I'm not invited to sleep-overs.
I can dial 9-1-1 at the touch of a button, y'know. Now, go away!
I'm pressing, a policeman is on his way.
Okay, okay! I'm going. I'm going.
I'm taking my time, alright? I'm laying the groundwork. Yeah. I mean, every day I get just a little bit closer to...
No, no, no. I'm not in the zone.
Ross, you're mayor of the zone.
Priesthood! Look Ross, I'm telling you, she has no idea what you're thinking. If you don't ask her out soon you're going to end up stuck in the zone forever.
I will, I will. See, I'm waiting for the right moment. What? What, now?
Okay, I got us a court date for tomorrow at 2:00 and I picked up all the forms. I'll take care of everything.
December 26th, huh maybe she's Santa Clause.
Oh look who it is, my husband. The apple of my eye.
Well sure, if you say you're gonna take care of everything I have no reason to doubt you. Give me those forms! All right, now I'm gonna do this my way and I don't want to hear a peep out of you!
Okay Rach, but...
Eh, her-her uncle already had planned on doing it. And y'know, we-we said our good-byes this morning, so...
So uh, Emily just went to the airport.
Oh. Why didn't you take her?
You must feel horrible. Hey! The guys have free porn!
Nah.
Every week, the TV Guide comes to Chandler and Joey's apartment. What name appears on the address label?
Nice shooting!
We'll take Literature!!
Chandler gets it! It's Chandler Bing!
No!!
Something could've happened. All right? She-she really dug my slides. And-and she was definitely giving me the vibe.
No. No. Nothing happened. I shut the drapes to uh, show her slides of my favorite fossils.
Oh, slides. So really nothing happened.
Right. Was it the, "Please don't show me another picture of a trilobite vibe?"
Anyway, if she, if she wasn't in to me, why-why would she ask me out again?
Yeah well, he's not gonna get this one. Ben is way cuter than that kid. I mean look at him, look at you,
Hey, that kid looks familiar.
Oh yeah, yeah! He's done tons of commercials. I've seen him in like Sugar Smacks, Playstation, and that one for the phone company. In fact he was so good in that one, he actually convinced me to switch phone companies. Chandler was mad....
That's great. Listen, wouldn't it be great though if I got to play Ben's dad?
Joey, you look nothing like Ben.
Oh, it's-it's Marcel. He keeps shutting me out, y'know? He's walking around all the time dragging his hands...
Hey, y'know, this is so not what I needed right now.
What's the matter?
That's so weird, I had such a blast with him the other night.
Really.
Come on Pheebs, it's not that bad! Y'know most people would be excited if they didn't have to work for a couple of weeks.
Then yes that is what I'm having.
Oh my God!
Most people don't like their jobs, I love my job! I have not been working for three hours and I'm already going crazy. I miss Joan.
Honey, having a heart attack is nature's way of telling you to slow it down.
All right, y'know what? If you are not going to learn how to ride this bike then I'm sorry, I'm just gonna have to take it back.
Phoebe.
What?! What the hell?!
What?! Why?!
Because! Because, it-it-it's... It'd be like you having this guitar and-and never playing it. Okay, this guitar wants to be played! And-and this bike wants to be ridden and-and if you don't ride it you-you're-you're killing its spirit! The bike is dying.
Alright, you madcap gal. Try to imagine this. The phone bill arrives, but you don't pay it right away.
Oh c'mon! When we were kids, yours was the only Raggedy Ann doll that wasn't raggedy!
Okay, so I'm responsible, I'm organised. But hey, I can be a kook.
Why not?
Because you're a kook! Instead you wait until they send you a notice.
Well, I was going to stick it in the ATM, but now I think I'll show the sexy teller that I am a published writer.
Your joke? Well, I think 'the Hef' would disagree, which is why he sent me a check for one hundred ah-dollars.
So, you stole my joke, and you stole my money.
Well, she is going to know that you stole the joke.
Oh, what are you going to do, follow me down there?
Listen, I-I need a favor. Umm, I was in the shower, and as I was cleansing myself, I ah, I-I, well I felt something.
Hey.
Hey.
Was it like a sneeze only better?
No, no, I mean, I mean a thing on my body.
Jen, I know this may sound a little... But uh, would you maybe wanna grab a cup of coffee sometime, or...
I had just moved in. Thank you! Listen umm...
Jen.
Sure! That would be nice.
Umm?
Ooh, ooh. Because she's my ex-wife, and will probably want to bring her, ooh, ooh, lesbian life partner.
Well, I'm off to Carol's.
Ooh, ooh! Why don't we invite her?
Hi, is uh, is Carol here?
No, she's at a faculty meeting.
But-but, if you don't love this, we'll do it in any other place at any other time. Really, it's fine, whatever you want.
Okay? But-but imagine a lot more lights, okay? And-and y'know fewer bricks, and-and-and flowers, and candles...
And the musicians, look, they can go over here , okay? And the chairs can face this way , and... You go.
It's perfect.
And, I don't know, if it starts to rain...
Well, they painted over the word 'Sapien' for one thing, then they rearranged the figures, let's just leave it at that.
Okay, I have a problem I have to go into work for a few hours, some kids messed up the Homo Sapien display.
What did they do?
So, do you want me to watch Ben for you?
Yes, that's what I was going to ask, thank you.
Yeah, it's the Ultimate Fighting Combo. Yeah, I saved thirty cents, plus I get to keep the cup. Yay!!
Hey!
God Ross, what is that?
From New York City, New York! Appearing in his Ultimate Fighting Championship debut! He's known for his confrontational business style. Ladies and Gentlemen, introducing Pete Beck-errrr!!
I love you, Pete!!!
Whoah, uh, what happened to, uh, 'Forget relationships! I'm done with men!' The whole, uh, penis embargo?
Really.
No. Oh, oh, I guess it would be different if I were- with somebody.
Oh, I don't know. I guess it's not about no guys, it's about the right guy, y'know? I mean, with Barry, it was safe and it was easy, but there was no heat. With Paolo, that's all there was, was heat! And it was just this raw, animal, sexual...
Wait-wait. I, I got it. I was there.
I don't know, I told her it was stupid to put off the wedding just because the hall was gone and she liked flipped out.
Yeah.
Why?!
Oh my God. You're even dumber than I am!
Excuse me?
And; people thinking it's huge has led Monica to believe that we are stealing her thunder. Which we are not!
Oh no!
No-no, it's really not huge.
Well, we're still talking about it, aren't we?
Well yeah, that and Chandler's problem.
Yeah. Ya know, a boy and a girl. Hopefully the girl will come first so Ben here won't feel too competitive.
Uhh, yeah. I mean, actually I kinda think that we'll have, we'll have two babies.
Two, two babies?
Then what's gonna happen?
Well, we won't wanna raise kids in the city so we'll probably move to uh, Scarsdale.
Anyway, I figured after work I'd go pick up a bottle of wine, go over there and, uh, try to woo her.
Well, I think it's perfect. Y'know, it's just gonna be the two of us, she spent all day taking care of my monkey...
I can't remember the last time I got a girl to take care of my monkey.
Hey, y'know what you should do? You should take her back to the 1890's, when that phrase was last used.
Now, now the one in the feather boa, that's Dr. Francis. Now, she used to be a man. Okay, now look, see, there's Raven. We hate her. We're glad she's dying. Okay- Wh- wh- Marcel, are you playing with Monica's shoes? You know you're not supposed to pl- whoah. Marcel, did you poo in the shoe? Marcel, bad monkey! Oh! Oh! Sorry, Barry. Little engagement gift. I'm sure you didn't register for that. Who died? Who died? Roll him over! Oh, c'mon, roll him over! Oh...! Well, we know it wasn't Dexter, right Marcel? Because- Marcel? Marc-
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm really sorry. Sorry. Sorry! Hey! Hey! I got my s's back! Which we can celebrate later. Celebrate.
Are you sure he didn't break it because it really hurts.
No, it's just a good bone bruise. And, right here is the puncture wound from your ring.
... with the double double double-jointed boy. Hey. So um, are you the professional guitar player?
Yeah. I'm Stephanie.
Okay, how about you flew to London to stop my wedding! Ah, how about you told me you loved me after I was already married!
Y'know, I-I-you've done a lot of stupid stuff too! Okay?
Oh, name one stupid thing that is as stupid as this one!
Hey! Wait a minute! That was different! I did those things because I was in love with you!
Yeah! Right!
Okay, Phoebe, this Dr. Oberman. He has no strong feelings about Fonzie or any of the Happy Days gang.
Fine! Maybe I will too!
Hey, you guys! Look what I found in the giiiiiiift shop. Get up! Get up! Get up!
Hi! And you're going into what grade?
Umm, I'm actually a first year resident, but I get that a lot, you see, I-I graduated early...
Well, actually it's been great. She's 20 so she's not looking for anything too serious, which is perfect for me right now.
Yeah. In fact, I like her so much you tell her I want my cookies early this year! Y'know, a box of Thin Mints and some Tag-a-Longs.
Hey-hey come on you guys, give him a break. Ross, seriously, how's it going with her?
Well that is great. And seriously, she seems very nice.
Thanks. I know you guys like to give me a hard time and all, but it really means a lot to me that you like her. Just knowing that you guys are...
Okay, I have a problem I have to go into work for a few hours, some kids messed up the Homo Sapien display.
Ewww! Ugly Naked Guy is using his new hammock. It's like a Play-Doo Fat Factory.
Well, I'm going to the dentist, so listen, okay, just be on the look out for anything that, that, that you can fall into, or, or that can fall on you, or... All right, just look out! Okay, And um, I also just wanna, I just wanna tell you all that um......
What did they do?
Well, they painted over the word 'Sapien' for one thing, then they rearranged the figures, let's just leave it at that.
Oh man! I want that place so much!! I was so sure that was gonna work! There's twelve bucks I'll never see again!
Well yeah! Someone sent us a basket at work once and people went crazy over those little muffins. It was the best day.
Your work makes me sad.
All right honey, we'd better go if we wanna catch that movie.
Bye!
Okay, 'you' can't, or you can't? Okay, that's my finger. That's, that's my knee. Still doing the play. Aaah!
No! Okay, you mean, you're not gonna talk to her, you're not gonna tell her how you feel?
That would be no. Look, just because you played tonsil tennis with my mom doesn't mean you know her. Alright? Trust me, you can't talk to her.
Alright, whadyou do with him?
Oh! You're awake!
I think this will be fine. Okay, vanilla milkshake, just a vanilla milkshake, with chicken bits floating in it. Cheers.
Okay, okay. If that is what it takes to show you how much you mean to me, and how much I want you there. Then that's what I'll do.
Oh, wait, let me get you another glass. That's been sitting out.
No, no, no, wait! Okay, okay. Don't! I'll go, I'll go!
You will?!
Y'know what I didn't wear this suit for a year because you hated it. Well, guess what? You're not my girlfriend anymore so...
Hey, you guys! Guess what?
Got a job on a river boat?
Oh I see, so this suit is making a point.
Right.
Anytime anything comes close to touching her eye or anyone else's she like freaks out. Watch! Watch!
Oh God, here we go!
What?
Ross! Come on! That's all right! Fine--Okay, I have a weird thing about my eye. Can we not talk about it please?
All right, fine.
I told her I'd have to think about it. I mean, how the hell am I supposed to make this kind of a decision? I'm actually asking you!
Why?
What?! You can't-what did you tell her?
Well, you can't just not see Rachel anymore, she's one of your best friends.
Yeah! But, he can't not exactly see Emily, I mean that's his wife.
Ben, you ready? All right, gimme your foot. Ok, on three, Ben. One, two, three. Ok, That's it, Ben.
Ok, got the vent open.
Hi, I'm Ben. I'm hospital worker Ben. It's Ben... to the rescue!
What do you see?
Well, Susan, I see what appears to be a dark vent. Wait. Yes, it is in fact a dark vent.
As my lawfully wedded wife, in sickness and in health, until death parts us. Really, I do. Emily.
As my lawfully wedded wife, in sickness and in health, till death parts us.
Looks like that might come any minute.
May I have the rings? Emily, place this ring on Ross's finger as a symbol of your bond everlasting. Ross, place this ring in Emily's hand as a symbol of the love that encircles you forever.
Happy to.
Well, I added the 'exactly like me' part... But she said she's looking for someone, and someone is gonna be there tonight.
I'm telling you, she said she's looking for a relationship with someone exactly like me.
She really said that?
'Tonight' tonight?
Well, I think it's perfect. Y'know, it's just gonna be the two of us, she spent all day taking care of my monkey...
Yeah, see, I don't think it's gonna that difficult considering this one won't be taking place in the basement of a Pizza Hut.
Oh, just planning my bachelor party with my best man.
Yeah, well, good luck trying to top the last one.
Oh, I'm Ross. I'm Ross. I'm too good for the Hut; I'm too good for the Hut.
Look, I gotta go pick up Ben. Everything so far sounds great Joey, just remember to keep it on the mellow side, okay? Just a couple of guys hanging out playing poker, no-no strippers or anything okay?
No, I can't. I would, I really would, but my son is here; I can't leave him. Isn't-you don't think there's any way?
Well, so, you-you'll get a job here! I mean, I'm always hearing about uh, them foreigners coming in here and stealing American jobs; that could be you!
Yeah, but it-it-it's my whole life-you come to England.
Ohh, I don't think so. I mean it would be different if it was way into the future &#150;and-and-and we were getting married or something.
What?
So, you gals wanna hand over your money now? That way, we don't have to go through the formality of actually playing.
You know what? This is not over. We will play you again, and we will win, and you will lose, and you will beg, and we will laugh, and we will take every last dime you have, and you will hate yourselves forever.
Hmm. Kinda stepped on my point there, Mon.
Ooooh, that's fine. We'll see who has the last laugh there, monkey boy.
OK, we done with the chit-chat? Are we ready to play some serious poker?
I'll help you. Yeah, I'll make up a schedule and make sure you stick to it. And plus, it'll give me something to do.
Or that.
I can't write! Y'know I mean I-I-I'm an actor, I don't have the discipline that takes, y'know? I can't do it.
Really? You'd-you'd do that for me?!
Yeah!
Yeah that! You know I hate practical jokes! They're mean and they're stupid and-and I don't want my son learning them!
That's right! That's right! Saran Wrap on the toilet seat so the pee goes everywhere!
Oh that.
Oh, come on! Saran Wrap on the toilet seat, you don't think that's just a little funny?!
I was barefoot. Now tell me, the toilet thing is the only thing you taught him right?
Look guys, when I'm with her it's-it's-it's like she brings this-this-this great side out of me. I mean I-I-I love her, y'know?
I mean, why not! I mean, I mean why not?!
Because you've only known her for six weeks! Okay, I've got a carton of milk in my fridge I've had a longer relationship with!
And I love the milk! But, I'm not gonna some British girl to move in with me! Joey, you say things now.
All right look, Ross, he's right. Emily's great, she's great! But this way too soon, you're only gonna scare her!
Oh, that is so sweet. No, no, ok, you hang up. Ok, ok, one, two, three. Well you didn't hang up either.
But we haven't seen each other since then. Well I land in China, guess who's in charge of the dig.
Julie! Julie, isn't that great? I mean, isn't that just kick- you-in-the-crotch, spit-on-your-neck fantastic?
She didn't hang up either...
Ok, no, no, you hang up. You, you, y-
Don't you realise none of this would've ever happened if I didn't think at that same moment you weren't having sex with Mark?
Wax the door shut, we're never leaving, ever.
Hi, it's Phoebe. Listen someone's gonna have to take my 9:00 with Mr. Rehack, 'cause it's like 9:15 now, and I'm not there.
All right. Let's say I had slept with Mark. Would you have been able to forgive me?
Yes I would.
All right so, Chandler, from now on, don't give your boss a chance to get you. Y'know just ah, don't turn your back to him.
Yeah. What are we getting?
Anything but stew.
Yeah, or you can teach him a lesson. Y'know? What you could do is you could rub something that really smells on your butt, all right? Then, when he goes to smack ya, his hand will smell. Now what could you rub on your butt that would smell bad?
What if Joey were president?
Y'know what? She'd-she'd love this. Uh, it's an exact replica of Apollo 8. I made it in the sixth grade.
Oh, why don't you make her one of your little jokes.
I'm going crazy! Okay? Do you have any thing around here that looks homemade?
Yeah, I guess I could use that. I could say that your love sends me to the moon.
Yeah-yeah, except Apollo 8 didn't actually land on the moon. But you-you-you could write that umm, your love lets me orbit the moon twice and return safely.
Well you shouldn't be. Believe me I wouldn't want to be the guy who's up against you. I mean that doofus is going to lose!
Really?! Joe? What would you do if you were in Ross's situation?
Well, I sorta am. I mean yeah, I'm dating this girl who's also seeing another guy. But, I don't know, I'm not to worried about it.
So this is nice! I wish I didn't have to go, believe me! But unfortunately I have to. Oh uh, by the way, what's the name the girl you're dating?
Kristen Lang.
Look, G. I. Joe's in, Barbi's out. And if you guys can't deal with it, that's your 'too bad.'
Hey, I don't know what to tell you guys that's the doll he chose.
What'd you do, dip it in sugar?
What are you being such a weenie for? So he has a Barbi, big deal. You used to dress up like a woman.
What?
Well w-w-w-w-wait, w-wait, wait, wait a minute! I mean a couple of stupid boxes get wet and she gets a Porsche?!
I've been thinking about getting rid of it. I was driving it the other day and saw my reflection in a store window. Your mother's right, I do look like an ass.
Wait, you're giving me your Porsche, you're kidding me right?!
Why don't we take it for a spin?
All right!
How was I supposed to know we'd end up being friends after college, let alone you-you would be living with my sister?
I don't know, aheh, your's was the first name that-that popped into my head, I'm I'm sorry. I-I didn't think it would matter.
How could it not matter?!
What about all that "friends forever" stuff?
I don't know, I-I was all high.
Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, that glacier's getting kinda close.' See?
Does she.
He's out banging other women over the head with a club, while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet!
Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife?
No. No.
No, no, I mean, ya know, I, I read a book and there was a girl named Emily and I thought, I thought that might be good.
C'mon, what, you never think about our future?
Yes, but I, I think about who's apartment we're gonna sleep at tomorrow night and, and where we're gonna have dinner next Saturday night. I do not think about what our childrens' names are gonna be. You know what our childrens names are gonna be.
What was the book?
The big book of childrens' names.
Nothing. Oh, actually, great news! I just got off the phone with Emily and it looks like I'm moving to a new apartment. Woo-hoo!
No-no-no, it's just a bit sudden. No, it's great. Okay? I'm totally on board. I love you too, all righty. Bye.
What's the matter Ross?
Why?
Well, her thought is, and I agree, fresh new furniture, why not a fresh new apartment? Her cousin has this great place to sublet, it's got a view of the river on one side and Columbia on the other.
Okay, okay. If that is what it takes to show you how much you mean to me, and how much I want you there. Then that's what I'll do.
I think you should drink the fat.
Yaaaay!
Oh, wait, let me get you another glass. That's been sitting out.
I think this will be fine. Okay, vanilla milkshake, just a vanilla milkshake, with chicken bits floating in it. Cheers.
Ah, so then his plane didn't explode in a big ball of fire?... Just a dream I had- but, phew.
When did Rigatoni get back from Rome?
Last night.
Hey hey hey! She's on!
Ah! Nora Bing!
Remember when sometimes he'd borrow your hat, and, and when you got it back there'd be little monkey raisins in it.
Sometimes I wonder if I did the right thing, ya know, giving him away.
Oh, Ross, you had to, I mean, he was humping everything in sight. I mean, I have a Malibu Barbi that will no longer be wearing white to her wedding.
Yeah, well sure, when he did it, it was funny. When I did it to my boss's hat. . . all of the sudden I have this big attitude problem.
Hey, hey, check it out, guess what I got.
Uh, huh. Yeah, right after I thank everyone for giving money to the museum, I sing a song about the wonder that is Joey.
No! Do you wanna hear it?
Am I in it?
Hello.
Hey!
Elizabeth! Okay. Okay. I'm gonna go out this window. I'll meet you at the front door. Just tell them you're going home, okay?
Yeah.
Ross? Ross?
Okay!
Oh wait-wait-wait!! No! Don't go in there! Don't go in there! I need another soda!
Fine! Thank you for warning me. At breakfast I'll be on full alert for room painting and sex weapons.
Okay.
And! She uses sex as a weapon!
You're still gonna go out with her?!
Yeah!
Y'know, here's the thing. Even if I could get it together enough to- to ask a woman out,... who am I gonna ask?
Angela's the screamer, Andrea has cats.
Right. Thanks. It's June. I'm outta here.
Isn't this amazing? I mean, I have never made coffee before in my entire life.
That is amazing.
Look, you guys, you guys should go. No, I'm, you, you planned this all out, and I don't want to ruin it, so you guys should just go.
Okay. Good, all right, let's get back in the car, 'cause it's freezing, and my chest is unsupported.
Oh what, wait, wait a second, I mean, what are we doing? Who's going with who?
Come on man, you drove all the way up here.
No, no, really, I've got to take the car back anyway, I'm spending all day tomorrow with Ben, It's fine, no guilt I promise.
Yeah but Pottery Barn! Y'know what I think? It's just she-she's weird. Y'know it's because she's a twin. Twins are weird.
Uh, yeah! I still can't believe she hates Pottery Barn!
Ross, get over it! It's not like she hates you.
Ross, she's not weird, she just wants her stuff to be one of a kind.
Huh. Y'know what's not one of a kind? A twin!
It'll be nice to get this off finally, won't it? Yes it will. Or we can leave it on for now, that's fine.
Nope.
Alright. Well then how about I call your supervisor, and I tell her that you shot my friend in the ass with a dart?
Y'know, with the right pair of pumps, that would be a great little outfit.
Listen, I'm- I'm sorry I was so hard on you before, it's just I...
I don't know, aheh, your's was the first name that-that popped into my head, I'm I'm sorry. I-I didn't think it would matter.
Okay, remember, we were young. Hey, Spring break, sophomore year, I got high in my bedroom and my parents walked in and smelled it and so I told them that you had gotten stoned and jumped out the window.
What?! Why did you do that?
How could it not matter?!
How was I supposed to know we'd end up being friends after college, let alone you-you would be living with my sister?
Yeah, uh, except for the red sock, which is still red. I'm sorry, please don't be upset, it could happen to anyone.
All right, all right, it's just that you left a red sock in with all your whites, and now, everything's kinda pink.
Oh, everything's pink.
Except it didn't. It happened to me. Oh, god, I'm gonna look like a big marshmallow peep. What am I doing? What am I doing? My father's right. I can't live on my own! I can't even do laundry!
Something went wrong with Underdog, and they couldn't get his head to inflate. So anyway, um, his head is like flopping down Broadway, right, and I'm just thinking... how inappropriate this is. Um, I've got something in my eye, uh, Joey, could we check it in the light, please?
Come on guys, I-I really want this guy to like me. It-it would really help me out if you guys were here to make me look good.
I just found out that Elizabeth's dad wants to meet me.
Wait a minute, hold the phone! You're not Elizabeth's dad?!
Of course we'll help! Yeah! We'll be here!
Thanks!
Oh sure, "Ross will do it!" It's not like he has a job, or a child, or a life of his own.
No! All right, who-who makes up the questions?
Ross will do it.
Fine! We'll ask Phoebe.
No-no-no, I-I wanna play.
I...Reorganized The Fridge. See, Bottom Shelf: Meats And Dairy. And Top Shelf expired products.
Come on! Tests make us all better learners! Oh yeah! We should have essay questions!!
What are you doing?
Why are you doing this?
Because I am bored...Out of my mind. I've already been to the bank, post office, and the dry cleaners.
Okay. Well, apparently Chandler's angry at us for not getting him a ticket to that Knicks game a couple of weeks ago.
Remember? You-you were eating pizza.
Yeah.
Oh, we're supposed to just get him a ticket?! That guy is always mooching off of us!
Yeah! Anyway, I-I still think we should try to patch things up, y'know? Like uh, maybe we could get him to get tickets to another Knicks game and invite him.
All right, we'll start off slow. The only thing you have to do tonight is come up with the name of your main character.
Yeah!
Thanks!
Done!
And it can't be Joey.
Hmmm. Oh, no, no, I just thinking about something funny I heard today. Umm, Mark, Mark saying 'I'll see you Saturday.'
Some day, maybe.
Funny book?
Yeah, at the lecture, I told you that last week, you said you didn't mind.
Oh, no, no, no, it's-it's not the lecture ah, I mind, umm....
Yeah, I know. I mean, no, you're right. Yeah I guess I'll let it go. But you-you understand how-how hard it is to forget about this.
No?
Look, Ross, you have what you want, you're back with Rachel. If you bring this up now you're gonna wreck the best thing that even happened to you.
Sure, it's hard to forget! But that doesn't mean you have to talk about it! A lot of things happened on that trip that we should never, ever talk about.
What the hell happened on that beach?!
Fine, you're right. Let's ah, let's take a break, let's cool off, okay, let's get some frozen yoghurt, or something..
Okay, it's not, it's not.
Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight with you Ross! Look, urrgh, maybe we should take a break.
No. A break from us.
Then, we had this big, stupid fight, and I said I wanted to take a break, I don't want to take a break.
That ring? When my grandmother first came to this country, that ring and the clothes on her back were all she had with her.
Yeah, right!
I was uh, I was thinking I might want to pick one of those babies up for myself, I might want to get one of those...
So you might say, the ring is irreplaceable?
Oh absolutely! It has been in my family for generations, and every bride who has worn it has had a long and happy life.
You wanna wander in the hall? Ooh, hey Ben, what if the Holiday Armadillo told you all about the festival of lights?
You are? Me, too!
Because Armadillos also wandered in the desert?
Cool!
Yeah!
No no, no, that, that's your Christmas tip, alright. Oh, hey, do you think there's a chance you could fix that radiator now?
Alright, alright, you know how you say I never seize the day? Well, alright, even though he's your super, I'm seizing. Mr. Treeger, here is 50 bucks, merry Christmas.
Oh wow, I didn't get you anything. Here's five back.
No can do, like I told the girl, I can't get a new knob until Thursday.
Ross.
What can I say, you missed your chance. From now on the only person who's going to enjoy these bad boys is me.
And uh, Rachel.
Yeah.
"We thought Phoebe would leave, but she just stayed and stayed. That's right, I'm here all night, and Chandler will never get l..."
Hey! Here's a dollar, consider it a deposit. Please sing at our wedding.
Yes! No-no! I know, I know what the list is! Mom! Look if you see Chandler, could you just let him know I'm looking for him?
What? Your-your list?
Yeah, the list that-of people we're allowed to sleep...
And if you see Rita Moreno, let her know I'm looking for her.
Action!
Oh, we were helping Chandler write his vows, but he kicked us out because Joey kept making inappropriate suggestions.
Hey!
Hey, what have you guys been up to?
How is "Monica, I love your sweet ass," inappropriate?
How's Monica coming along with her vows?
Okay, okay, I'm sorry, it will never happen... Uh-oh! Wait a minute! Wait-wait, now there are a hundred of you and I'm the king.
Ahh, sorry, nothing you can do about it. It's one of my ah, rights as the ex-boyfriend. Oop, oh yeah!
Stop it! Cut it out! Cut it out!
Rosss...
Come on, would you grow up? It's no big deal.
Perhaps. Now I'm curious, at what point during those girlish screams would you have begun to kick my ass?
A lesson in the importance of unagi.
Ohh, you're a freak!!
All right, so we weren't prepared!
I'm sorry I had to take such drastic measures to make my point, but I-look, I just want you guys to be safe. DANGER!!!!! Ahhh, huh? Unagi.
Well I'm thinking that Chandler's our friend and Janice makes him happy, so I say we just all be adult about it and accept her.
Yes, Joey, I remember, she's annoying, but you know what she's-she's his girlfriend now. I mean what can we do?
There you go! That's the spirit I'm looking for! What can we do? Huh? All right who's first? Huh? Ross?
Yeah, we'll call that Plan B. All right?
Honey, I was wondering....
Okay, that's it. I cannot make this decision! It is too difficult, so I'm just gonna leave it entirely to the gods of fate.
We're on in 3, 2,
Welcome back to our fall telethon. Now if you've been enjoying the performance of Cirque Du Soleil, and you'd like to see more of the same kind of programming, it's very simple. All you have to do is call in your pledge and at that time tell the operator, one of our volunteers, what kind of programming you'd like to...
A Magic Eight ball?! You can't be serious, you can't make this decision with a toy!
Ooh, it's not a toy.
Oh, no! No-no! No, I tired! But I couldn't. That's why I'm here. Maybe we could attack them together? That-that's a no.
No, I mean it's okay, I mean, they're-they're my friends. In fact, I-I-I was married to one of them.
Let me get this straight man, you attacked your ex-wife?!
I am so, so, so, so sorry!
Uh-huh.
The judge wouldn't let us get an annulment! Now we gotta get a divorce!! Did a Porsch throw up on you?
Hi! How are the Gellers?
Don't call us that!
Hey! It's Porsche!!
Me taking care of you is no problem, huh? You guys feel safe. Right? Okay, I'm gonna take that spit bubble as, "Yeah, I do!" Okay, after I get rid of this dirty diaper Leslie, I'll set you up with a clean one. Okay, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you. I just have to clean that up. Okay? 'Cause let's face it, we're at Monica's. I broke it. All right. Well, that's just the way that goes. Okay, good. Why are there only two of you? Where is Leslie? Well, you can't answer. Leslie? Where are you Leslie? Leslie, now would be a good time for your first words! Well, look at you! Hey! You are a little bit mischievous! My gosh! Oh, you're a lot mischievous! Well, it'll dry. Okay, you sit with your brother and sister now-who aren't there!
Yeah, I really do. Yeah, but what am I gonna do, I mean we-we both agreed that it was gonna be a two-week thing, y'know no commitment.
What do you mean?
You seem to really like her.
Ross, that girl just spent the entire evening talking to your friends, asking to hear stories about you, looking through Monica's photo albums, I mean you don't do that if you're just in it for two weeks.
You think?
I-I-I don't even know why I bother to talk to you guys about it. Y'know what? I'm just gonna do it on my own with no naked chicks.
Please don't say naked chicks.
Why not?!
That's the way I did it 'til I was 19.
Hey.
That's all right, Rach, we got the bags. Hi, hello. Julie, this is my sister Monica. This is Chandler. Phoebe. Joey, what up?
Ok, I think she's trying to tell us something. Quick, get the verbs.
You, you, you said he liked me. You, you slowpokes!
What up?!
Everyone, this is Julie.
Oh, thanks, thanks. So Monica tells me that uh, you don't want to play anymore because me and y'know my talent. Is that true?
Hey!
Hey! You were really great! You were really, really great!
Well, kinda. Yeah. Yeah.
Pheebs...
Fine, OK! Heat, heat, heat, and I'm the obsessive one. OK, this way is on, so this is. . . off.
Sure. By the way, there's a difference between being obsessive and. . .
Ross, the heat!
Did you just break the radiator?
No, no, I was turnin' the knob and, and. . . here it is.
Okay, relax, relax. We are gonna be here for a while, it looks like, and we still have boyfriends and your career to cover.
Oh, maybe that's it.
She is unbelievable, our mother is...
Oh God!
The fuzzy little mints at the bottom of her purse.
The uh, your hair, before, your hair, you said you thought your looks like an 8-year-old's, and I'm just saying I like it. The hair.
Oh. Uh, by the way, if it makes you feel any better. I happen to like 8-year-old boys.
What?!
Oh. Thanks.
You understand I don't actually like 8-year-old boys.
This isn't what I ordered! Man! Can anything go right in my life?! First my marriage falls apart and then...
Oh...
What is wrong now?!
I know! I know! And then you lose your apartment! And then you lose your job! And then your ex-wife gets married so fast! And now the coffee-ahh!! Ross, we need to talk.
Okay. Sometimes I feel...
Oh, I uh, hope you don't mind, I kinda uh, jazzed it up a little. Check this out. We will, we will, call you back!
Not a problem. And listen, hey! Since you're gonna be here for a while, why don't-I was thinking we uh, put your name on the answering machine.
Oh yeah!
Hey, all right!
Pretty cool, huh?
My best friend and my sister! I cannot believe this. You guys probably wanna get some hugs in too, huh? Big news!
Look, we're not just messing around! I love her. Okay, I'm in love with her.
I'm so sorry that you had to find out this way. I'm sorry, but it's true, I love him too.
Awww, no, it's okay, we've actually known for a while.
What? What? What?! You guys knew? You all knew and you didn't tell me?!!
Hey Joey I have to cancel racketball for tonight, that was Marcel's trainer. He's gonna let me have him for a couple of hours.
That is so unfair.
I know. Oh, like you would drink her coffee after what you did to her with Van Damme.
You're blowin' me off for a monkey?
Hey, we can rescedule for Saturday.
Your joke? Well, I think 'the Hef' would disagree, which is why he sent me a check for one hundred ah-dollars.
And monkeys can't write out prescriptions.
You are not allowed to laugh at my joke.
So, you stole my joke, and you stole my money.
Well, I was going to stick it in the ATM, but now I think I'll show the sexy teller that I am a published writer.
If the place you are referring too is being in love, then she is in the same place as me because I am not in that place!
I was hugging her as a friend. It's not my fault her-her hair got in my face, she's got a lot of it and it smells all-all uh...coconutty. What?! Oh, that doesn't mean I have feelings for Rachel! Maybe it means I have feelings for coconuts!
Okay, whatever you say. But just be careful, all right? Rachel's not in the same place you are.
Okay, I didn't understand that, but y'know, maybe that's 'cause you were speaking the secret language of love!
Hey! Dude, some guy just called for you.
Hey Pheebs! How's that uh, vegetarian pizza working out for ya? You and those vegetables have a real thing going on, huh?
Wait a minute. Chandler has a jewelry box?
Okay, we have like ten minutes. Do you want me to get into that now?!
Why are you being weird?
Do you like it?
Mom, there are so many people in my life. Some of them are seeing people and some of them aren't. Is that crystal?
Ohh.
She never tells us anything. Ross, did you know Monica's seeing someone?
So, who's the mystery man?
Well, uh, he's a doctor.
Oh, Carol and I have a new system. If she punches in 911, it means she's having a baby, otherwise I just ignore it.
Uh uh.
Aren't you gonna...
What about Andre?
Oh, well this morning he got a call from who I think was our cousin Nathan, and frankly, it was a little more than I needed to know.
No, but ah, there's coconut in the Hanukkah Menoreoes. I tell you what, I'll put you down for eight boxes, one for each night.
Wait a minute, one box! Come on, I'm trying to send a little girl to Spacecamp, I'm putting you down for five boxes. Chandler, what about you?
Ahh, do you have any coconut flavoured deities?
Mon?
All right, I'll take one box of the mint treasures, just one, and that's it. I-I started gaining weight after I joined the Brown Birds. Remember, how Dad bought all my boxes and I ate them all?
Okay, Jasmine, please, please don't. I love my girlfriend very much, and I want more than anything to just work it out with her. Okay?
I'm agreeing with you. Did you, listen, did you happen to tell Phoebe yet?
No.
All right.
Thank you, thank you.
I have been down in your store for twenty minutes trying to get a tie! What do I have to do to get some service?! Hi Rach.
What's going on?! That's what's going on!!
Ross!
Ah Joey. Joey Tribbiani. Listen Joey, I got a problem, I just got a call from my dance captain, he's having a relationship crisis and can't get out of Long Island.
So, does that mean the audition is off?
Oh, man. Oh, remember when I stuck that broom in your bike spokes, and you flipped over and hit your head on the curb?
Oh.
Wait, what about the time I hit you in the face with the Silvian's pumpkin?
No. But I remember people telling me about it.
I hope Ben has a little sister.
Carol, we've been through this before, ok? We have a good time. We laugh, we play. It's like we're father and son.
Hey, it's not the first time I lost a girl to a cowboy spraying cologne. Bijan for men? Bijan for men?!
Ok, and this is Funny Clown. Funny Clown is only for after his naps, not before his naps or he won't sleep.
Honey, relax. Ross is great with him. Don't look so surprised. I'm a lovely person.
Oh, this is so cute.
No ah-ah-ah! Do not start this car! Okay! Okay! I will give you twenty bucks if you get out of this car right now!
There is no way I am letting you drive this car! So why don't you just hand over the keys?
Oh.
Look Ross, if you're so freaked out, just get in the car!
With you?! Yeah right!
Look, our table is down in front, okay, my boss is gonna be there, everyone will see if we arrive after it starts.
Look, I don't care it starts at eight, we can't be late.
We could not, would not want to wait.
Has somebody been drinking my fat?
You guys, does this look like something the girlfriend of a paleontologist would wear?
So listen ah, I picked Monica for secret Santa, but I'm already getting her something for Chanukah, I was wondering if you wanna switch.
All right! Okay! I think I am making some progress with Joey, when I went into the apartment he went straight into his bedroom but he only slammed the door once! I mean yeah, he gave me the finger while doing it.
All right I... I gotta call my mom and ask her a left handed cooking question.
Oh y'know what, I was already trying to trade for ah, well, you.
Really?! Wow! That's-that's so nice, what are you gonna get me?
No, she likes that. Yeah. Faking sleep doesn't work either, I can't tell you how many mornings I woke up with her...
Well, yeah. I can't-I can't stay here all night, and if I go in there she's-she's gonna wanna... do stuff.
Well, can't you tell her that you are not in the mood?
Whoa-ho.
Whoa-oh, okay! Yeah, why am I telling you that?
Once Monica was sent to her room without dinner, so she ate the macaroni off a jewelry box she'd made.
Oh, is that funny?! Oh, you-you find that funny?! Well maybe Chandler should know some of your secrets too!
I-I already told him everything! You shush!!
Ross used to stay up every Saturday night to watch Golden Girls!
Monica couldn't tell time 'til she was 13!
Yeah, but we-we have to be at the Four Seasons for drinks in 15 minutes and then y'know, then The Plaza for dinner.
So we should probably get going soon.
Oh, but the party's only just getting started!
So why did you plan a party at the same time?
No-no-no, no, umm, actually American surprise parties are-are-are very short. It's usually, "Surprise!" And then, "Oh my God, I'm so surprised-good-bye!"
Yeah, she finally stopped crying yesterday, but then she found one of Richard's cigar butts out on the terrace, so.
Nope.
No, it's been three nights in a row.
Oh, okay that explains it. I got a call at two in the morning, but all I could hear was, like, this high squeaky sound, so I thought okay its like a mouse or a opossum. But then I realized where would a mouse or a opossum get the money to make the phone call.
Morning.
Pheebs come on! I mean, consider the source! Of course her ex-husband's gonna say that stuff. Now, if you'll excuse me...
Yeah!
Well, didn't you just hear what I said?!
No listen to me! She is crazy!
Uh, your door isn't sound proof.
Ok, sweetheart, I'll call you later tonight. Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, hey, hey, you're not really gonna go through with this, are you?
All right.
I'll see you guys later, I gotta go...do a thing.
You know, I think I might just.
So uh, what are you guys doing for dinner tonight?
Oh, great! Listen, oh I had to get you a whole new battery. I got you the best one I could, 'cause that's not where you want to skimp.
Hi! Sorry I'm late. Were you sleeping?
Ahh, nooo!!
You're a genius, Ross.
Yeah, well it came to about $112, but what the hell, just call it an even 110?
The sex? Um, I'm having enough trouble with the image of you and Susan together, when you throw in Tanya , yaw...
Of course it's your friend Tanya.
Don't you want to know about the sex?
The sex of the baby, Ross.
Oh, you know the sex of the baby? Oh, oh-oh-oh!
I can't believe we have to say goodbye to the house we grew up in. Man, some-some stranger's gonna be living in my room.
Okay? You ready?
Yeah, I... I don't want Stevie to see her like this.
Well, after 15 years of mom and dad keeping it as a shrine to you, it's time the velvet ropes came down.
They kept your room for a while.
Hey, hey, you're my baby, and I can't wait to meet you. When you come out I'll buy you a bagel, and then we'll go to the zoo.
No, no that was the first.
Keep singing! Keep singing!
I felt it!
Hey, hey, I'm your daddy. I'm the one without any breasts.
Well, there's this, uh, paleontology conference in L.A. so I figured I'd go and then drive down to the zoo and surprise Marcel.
Hey.
Ooh, where are you off to, Travelin' Jake?
You know I think he will be surprised, 'till he realizes he's a monkey, and uh, you know, isn't capable of that emotion.
Oh, Phoebe, that really cute guy is here again.
Yeah, that's okay, I mean if you guys all have to go away for the first weekend I'm alone by myself, y'know then I totally, totally understand.
So, for the whole weekend?
We're really sorry, but um, she did ask us first.
Y'know what, I can stay, I'm gonna stay. 'Cause the last time I went skiing I was to afraid to jump off the chair lift, I just went around and around.
Uh, Pheebs we kinda need you to drive us all up there in your grandmother's cab, but y'know what, I'll stay.
Celia, don't worry! Don't scream! He's not going to hurt you! Soothing tones, Celia. Soothing tones! Marcel...
Well, I don't know.... huh-huh.... but I'm hoping huh-huh.
I'm telling you, that monkey is a chick magnet! She's going to take one look at his furry, cute little face and it'll seal the deal.
I can't stand this! He's got his claws in my...
Alright...
Anyway, she thought the very idea of me playing rugby with him was like hilarious. So I'm gonna show her how tough I really am!
Well, you should've seen the guy that she used to go out with. I mean, he's like Joe Rugby.
You're kidding! And he plays rugby?! That's so funny. Ohh! I see how you did that. All right.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You're right, you are a tough guy. You're the toughest palaeontologist I know.
All right, come on look, Ross can take care of himself! It's not like he's...Chandler!
That-that would be incredible. Thank you so much. I-I still can't believe someone ate it!! I mean, look, I left a note and everything.
Just a sandwich? Look, I am 30 years old, I'm about to be divorced twice and I just got evicted! That sandwich was the only good thing going on in my life! Someone ate the only good thing going on in my life!
Okay, look, I-I have enough stuff for one more sandwich, I mean I was going to eat it myself, but
Knock-knock. Who's there? Ross Geller's lunch. Ross Geller's lunch, who? Ross Geller's lunch, please don't take me. Okay?
I'm surprised you didn't go home wearing your lunch.
Oh, yeah, last week you had a wonderful, nutty, chocolatey kind of a cakey pie thing. Nothing, just, just, I'm fine.
Yeah, I know, he's sweet, but it's just not fun anymore, you know? I don't know if it's me, or his hunger strike, or, I don't know.
Does anybody want anything else?
What's the matter? Why so scrunchy?
It's my father. He wants to give me a Mercedes convertible.
Look Rach if-if you want to go for a ride in the Porsche I'll be glad to take you for a quick spin around the block.
Okay, I can fix this! Okay Monica, Rachel thinks all you can talk about is the wedding.
Great! Well Rachel, the reason why I won't let you drive the Porsche is because you're a terrible driver. There! That wasn't about the wedding.
Yeah, you got a couple hours?
Whew! That was a brisk ride!
My-my ring? My-my wedding ring? The-the stripper stole my wedding ring?! H-how?! How could this all happen?!
So you might say, it's a magic ring.
Yeah, the stripper stole it.
Well, I think it all started when you said, "Hey Joey, why don't you be my best man."
All right-all right, fine! I-I'm gonna call the cops!
I don't know, but I ah, I have the feeling that my being there will do it. I'll go over and I will borrow something. Juice!! I need juice!!
Okay, I have to do something. I mean, I have, I have to stop it!
Stop what?!
No!! You can't!!
Look, they must be stopped!
That's okay. She's still in there enjoying her fake party and uh, it's too late to do any of the things I had planned, so...
Okay.
Ohh, here you are. I was looking for you before. Joshua's gone so you and Emily are free to go.
Oh, Ross, I'm sorry. I completely ruined your evening.
Yeah.
How do you think it's gonna look when you get her something incredibly meaningful and expensive and her boyfriend Joey gives her an orange?
Yeah, and what a great way to say, "I secretly love you, roommate's girlfriend!"
It doesn't say that. Does it?
Okay, all right, I'll just uh, make sure that uh, Joey gets her something really great.
It's gotta be better than that book. Oo! Like a crossbow!
Yeah, I guess we don't have a choice. Help us! Please help us! We're stuck up on the roof and we can't get down!!!
I can't believe this!!
All right well, y'know...I guess we know what we have to do to get down.
Ross. I was thinking we could just go down the fire escape.
I know, I wasn't finished. But don't worry! We're gonna go down the fire escape!!
Oh, come here sweetie, listen, you're gonna go on like a thousand interviews before you get a job. That's not how that was supposed to come out.
Hey! How'd the interview go?
Oh, I blew it. I wouldn't of even hired me.
This is the worst Christmas ever.
Y'know what Rach, maybe you should just, y'know stay here at the coffee house.
Oh really, really great! Yeah! A-actually she's right down the street, umm, do-do you know what? You should stop bye and say hi.
Is-isn't it the best?
Oh, it's the best! So, umm how's Monica?
Ohh, I would love too.
Yeah? Oh-oh, she'd be so excited!
Well look, I'm just trying to focus on the "I get to see my wife," part, all right? And not the part that makes me do this.
I told Emily to come. And I just need to y'know, talk to Rachel about it.
Wait a minute! So when Emily comes you're just, you're not gonna see Rachel anymore?
Wow, so you guys are, you're never gonna be in the same room together? How is that even gonna work?
I have no idea. I mean... But-but I assure you I will figure it out.
Yay! Seriously, our sex life... I was thinking, maybe I don't know, we could try some-some new things. Y'know? For fun?
Hey there little fella! Hey, uh-hey, why don't we get some shoes on ya, huh? Hey, why don't you show dad how you can put your shoes on, in your room! Yay!!
Yay!
Like what?
Well I don't know umm, what if we were too tie each other up? Umm, some people eat stuff off one another. Nah! Umm, y'know we-we could try dirty talk? Umm, we could, we could have a threesome.
But work comes first! Oh hey, but that's sad about you though, what happened? Burn out? Burn all out, did ya?
Come on sweetie! You've had to work late every night for the past two weeks, what is it this time?
Actually, it's kinda my fault. I-I quit today.
Nooo, he's leaving for a better job.
Oh well that's great, so I guess this is ah, this is good bye then. Huh? Good bye.
Alright, I panicked, alright? She took me by surprise. You know, but it wasn't a total loss. I mean, we ended up cuddling.
Um... uh.... vulva.
Vulva?
Whoaa!! You cuddled? How many times??
Shut up! It was nice. I just... I don't think I'm the dirty-talking kind of guy, you know?
Well I-I-I, that kind of thing requires some serious thought. First, I'll divide my perspective canidates into catergories....
Thank you.
What about you honey, who would be on your list?
What a geek!
Everbody this is Frank! This is my half-brother Frank.
I'm telling you, this guy Rachel is with is crazy! Okay? He viscously screamed at total strangers! I think he's baaad news!
So that's the girl you like.
Yeah.
Wait a minute, wait a minute, you don't like the guy Rachel's dating? Well, that's odd.
Oh, hey, Lauren. Uh, you guys this is, this is Kate's understudy, Lauren.
Eh, 'cause I knew that if I told you, you'd make me go, and I knew you needed someone to be with you tonight. Come on. Come on.
Yeah.
Ross, why didn't you tell me that?
I cannot believe you.
What?
So I finally heard back from Aunt Sheryl and apparently it wasn't a mistake. Ahh, there's-there's limited seating in the hall.
Hey.
Hey.
Limited seating?! I am just one tiny person!
Well yeah, but she doesn't know that. I mean, the last time she saw you-you would've turned one of those little wedding chairs into kindling.
Maybe it was both of us, but we had our best friend's interest... But we had our best friend's interest at heart.
About yesterday, I was really wrong. I am sorry.
No, it was me. I'm sorry. I over reacted.
Could I be more sorry.
I don't know, I'm one sorry polentologist. All right Joey, we get it. I'm sorry.
How weird is that? Y'know? You're moving in with me and have the one thing I don't have. It's like uh, in a way you-you complete me kitchen.
And it's a magnet!
Look at that!
What?!
You complete me kitchen, matey!
Well, you need something to make this day special? Hello! You-you-you have the most special thing of all! You are marrying the woman you love.
So?
So-If you wear that you'll make mine less special.
Please, don't take away my cool thing. Please?! Pretty please?!
Pretty please? Not very uh, 007.
Let me ask you something, at your school was there a like uh a place on campus where students went to uh, fool around.
My doctoral dissertation is in the library at school, I went to see it, and there were students makin' babies right in the middle of the Paleontology section!
Oh my God! Did you get to see anything good?
Yeah, there was. It was-there the corner of the library where-where all these dusty books that nobody ever read-Yes, there was.
Great! Because people kept showing up, I think it's like uh-a thing!
Yeah but, you know, now that I think about it, I don't think I've ever seen Fun Bobby without a... a drink in his hand.
Ooooooh.
So what. So he drank a lot tonight.
Yeah. Oh, OOOH, yeah, you know, did you notice how he always starts his stories with, um, OK, 'I was soooo wasted,' or, 'Oh, we were soooo bombed,' or, ummm, ooh, ooh, 'So I wake up, and I'm in this dumpster in Connecticut.'
Monica, have you ever been with him when he wasn't drinking?
No, it's for when Carol goes into labor. She can get me wherever I am. I mean, all she has to do is to dial 55-JIMBO.
What the hell does a paleontologist need a beeper for?
Is it like for dinosaur emergencies. 'Help, come quick, they're still extinct.'
A cool phone number, and a possible name for the kid.
All right, I'll see you guys later.
Emily is...incredible. I mean there-there are no words to describe it, I mean the whole weekend was like a dream. Oh! And you! Rach!
Hey!
Hey-ooh so, how was Vermont?
Oh, hey!
Hey! You were so right!
This year was supposed to be great! But, it's only the second day and I'm a loser with stupid leather pants that don't even fit!
Oh my God!
We heard about your pants, I'm so sorry.
No. No, you're not a loser.
Look at me!
No, no, really, I've got to take the car back anyway, I'm spending all day tomorrow with Ben, It's fine, no guilt I promise.
Look, you guys, you guys should go. No, I'm, you, you planned this all out, and I don't want to ruin it, so you guys should just go.
Come on man, you drove all the way up here.
Thank you.
All right, we'll call you when we get back.
Because It's The Highest. Situation No.1 You're with Monica, the wedding is about to start when Monica gets cold feet. Go!
No, 10 is the highest.
Why is 10 the highest?
I don't want to marry Chandler!
Okay, uh...
Oh, hey y'know, they-they really overcharge you for that stuff. But who cares?! Because it's all on me! That is, one big drink!
Okay, there was some staring and pointing.
Okay, I need a, I need a drink!
Macadamia nut?
Umm... Wow! That's-that's some pricey nut!
Uh, hello dad! Monica and I just saw the house in the paper! Yes we're surprised! Who did you leave a message with?
I can't believe they-they didn't even tell us!
I can't believe I still don't know what happened to the window in the attic!
Sorry!
Joey, Joey I am so sorry.
Okay, okay, fine, you're right. Let's ah, let's take a break, let's cool off, okay, let's get some frozen yogart, or something..
Oh I'm, I'm making this too hard. Okay, what do you want me to do.
I don't know, I don't know. Urrrgh! Look, maybe we should take a break.
No. A break from us.
And the advances in collating in the past five years, I mean we just got in an X-5000, y'know. The X-5000 makes the X-50 look like a T-71.
Oh, mine too. Isn't that neat, scotch neat. Would you excuse me? Hey, hey, where you uh, sneakin off to mister?
Hi. Uh, I have been in the bathroom. Stay clear of the salmon mousse.
Oh, scotch neat. Ya know, that's Rachel's father's drink.
I'm getting my cigarettes out of my jacket.
No. no.
Okay. He was more embarrassed about that than anyone. Okay? And for him to have the courage to walk back in here like nothing happened...
'That thing'? This is how you greet guests at a party? Let me ask you something, if I showed up here with my new girlfriend, she wouldn't be welcome in your home?
I'm guessing your new girlfriend wouldn't urinate on my coffee table.
Alright. Just keep him away from me.
Thank you. C'mon, Marcel, whaddya say you and I do a little mingling? Alright, I'll, uh... catch up with you later.
Well, this is ironic. Of your last two boyfriends, Richard didn't want to have kids, and from the looks of it, now Pete can't.
Oh! Oh!
Wait, if that's his favourite area, why is he being so mean to it?
Ohh!!
So ah, your first sexual experience was with a woman?!
Alright, I've gotta go. C'mon, Marcel! C'mon! We're gonna go take a bath. Yes we are, aren't we? Yes, we are.
I meant female nudity. Alright? I don't need to see Lou Grant frolicking.
Hugh! Hugh Grant!
They're still just friends, right?
And I will see you tomorrow!
Nothing! There's nothing to do! I mean, she lives there, I live here. I mean, she-she'd have to uh, move here. She should move here!
I just, I hate this so much! I mean, every time I go pick her up at the airport, it's-it's so great. But at the same time I'm thinking, "Well, I'm gonna be right back there in a couple of days, dropping her off."
So what are you going to do?
What?
I could ask her to live with me!
Okay Pheebs, I know how we're going to figure this out. Okay, clear your mind and answer the first thing that comes into your head. Okay?
Really?
Y'know what you should send him? A cartoon of cigarettes. 'Cause that why he could trade it for protection. No. That's prison.
Uh-hmm.
What do you like better flora or fauna?
Excuse me, I'm seizing. Mr. Treeger, here's another 50, happy Hanukkah. Will uh, will this help with the knob getting?
Whatever.
What'cha gonna' do?
No, the place is not open 'till Tuesday. Am I not saying it right.
So, wait, you really did like my cookies?
So, uh, the other night Rachel and I are in bed talking about fantasies, and I happened to describe a particular Star Wars thing....
Okay, okay, I'll go first.
Okay.
Princess Leia in the gold bikini.
Yes!
Chandler!!! Chandler!!! Chandler, I saw what you were doing through the window! Chandler, I saw what you were doing to my sister! Now get out here!
I wonder if its time for you to rejoin our team at the museum?
Oh Donald that-that would be great. I am totally ready to come back to work. I-What? No! Wh... What are you doing?!! GET OFF MY SISTER!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Wow! Listen, we had a good run. What was it? Four? Five months? I mean, that's more than most people have in a lifetime! So, good-bye, take care, bye-bye then!
What are you doing?!
Aw, how can you say that? I cant even get Marcel to stop eating the bath mat. How am I gonna raise a kid?
I always knew I was havin a baby, I just never realised the baby was having me.
Oh, youre gonna be great!
You know, Ross, some scientists are now saying that, that monkeys and babies are actually different.
Wherere you going?
Look-Okay, I'm just gonna-I'm gonna have to go find him and bring him back! Okay? You-you make sure Monica does not find out, okay?
Don't be so negative! Good God! Isn't it possible that Sorry is sitting in there right now?!
Okay. Phoebe, I-I think Ross is right. What are we gonna do?
Okay.
Okay but if you don't find him and bring him back, I am gonna hunt you down and kick your ass!
Right, but, it is just me and the baby, so I'm thinkin' they can take us. And so I uh, hah-hah, I just heave it down field.
No, no, with him. I'm on this field, and they, they hike me the baby... and I, I know I've gotta do something 'cause the Tampa Bay defence is comin' right at me.
Tampa Bay's got a terrible team.
What are you crazy? That's a baby!
He should take the sack?
And I'm sure you're gonna make a big impression. Hi! I'm Rachel Green. It's nice to meet you. Come on, you probably have a broken rib!
Okay, okay. Look, you have got to go to a doctor! Okay?
No. I have got to get ready and go to a dinner at my bosses house. It's a very big deal, there's a lot of people there I have to meet.
Well, I will go to the hospital tomorrow, it'll still be broken then.
Rach...
Ohh, big smoker. Big big smoker. In fact I'm gonna go ou into the hallway and fire up this bad boy.
Rachel, you didn't tell me your boyfriend smoked.
Yeah, like a chimney.
Are you wearing my glasses?
Yes. I was just warming up the earpieces for you.
Ah... Ah...Get out of here! Uh, meeting someone? Or-or are you just here to brush up on Marion's views on evolution?
Oh-oh, you're-you're fellow scholars. What exactly were you looking for, hmm? Perhaps, perhaps Dr. Chester Stock's musings on the Smiledon Californicus?
Uhh....
Uh, actually I find Marion's views far to progressionist.
I find Marion's views far to progressionist.
Tag? Y-You're going? Uh we didn't, uh we didn't get the chance to talk. Uh, so, where did you say you're from again?
Oh.
Thanks for having me over, you guys.
Colorado.
Ah, what good are you.
I wonder how I would react under fire, y'know? And not backfire but-but heavy fire, like I was in a war or something.
Hey Pheebs, has Gary ever been shot at for real?
Yes. Once. Yeah, a little. He kinda did it to himself. It's not really a good story.
Man, I would be great in a war! I mean, I really, I think I would make a fantastic military leader. I mean I know I would make General way before any of you guys.
Before or after you were shot by your own troops?
Yeah. And you should hold out for something bigger. I can't tell you how much respect I have for you not going to that stupid cab driver audition.
No look I wasn''t right, that's what I came here to tell you. I was totally hung up on, on my own stuff. Listen, I'm someone who needs the whole security thing, ya know. To know exactly where my next paycheck is coming from buy you, you don't need that and that's amazing to me. I could never do what you do Joey.
Thanks Ross.
I went.
Great, how did it go?
Well, y'know how I'm trying to work things out with Emily. Well, there's this one thing... Okay, here goes. I made a promise that--Oh hey!
Hey, so uh, y'know how there's something I wanted to talk to you about?
Oh yeah!
What?
You're nose is bleeding!
I was up all night writing this really nasty letter to Emily! It was perfect and now it's all covered in-in... Actually, thanks!
No! No! No!
What?!
All right! Everybody ready to go to the movies?
Uh actually, I think I'm gonna skip it.
Look, I didn't lose my mind! Okay, Janice and I have a lot in common! We've-we've both been divorced. We-we both have kids.
Ross! Janice?!
All right, hold on! Hold on. Hold on. This is Ross, okay? He's our friend. He obviously went crazy. He obviously lost his mind.
So are you actually gonna see her again?
Phoebe! Don't put ideas in his head!
Ben, say hi to Aunt Monica. Oh, I guess he doesn't feel like talking right now. He's smiling though! Okay, talk to you later.
Oh, I'm just over here with Ben. I thought we'd say hi.
Oh, put him on!
Yeah, I think it was better when you guys were sad. Hey, uh, remember the roller blades?
You know what else I'm not gonna miss? "I'm Monica. I wash the toilet 17 times a day. Even if people are on it!"
I knew you were gonna throw that in my face!! That was three years ago! She apologized and she apologized! What more do you want?!!
Well, excuse her for knowing what she wants to do with her life!
Yeah well, she certainly knew what she was doing New Year's Eve 1997.
We want the last six years back!!
So do we!! So do we!! I'm sorry you had to see that.
No, no it's not interesting. OK, it's very, very not interesting. In fact it's actually 100 percent completely opposite of interesting.
I didn't get a cat.
Oh, that's um, interesting.
Alright, I got it Ross.
You had no right to tell me you ever had feelings for me.
Well, I called over there and it turns out Ugly Naked Guy is subletting it himself and he's already had like a hundred applicants.
Hey!
Hey Ross! Any word on the apartment yet?
Oh.
No-no, I got the edge. I know it's not exactly ethical but I sent him a little bribe to
Oh, no-no-no, see, that-that clock's a little fast, uh, we have 17 minutes. Huh, what can we do in 17 minutes? Twice?
Hey, if mommy can have a wife, daddy can have a bra.
Ohh, it's time to go.
Well that's ambitious.
Hey, uh, you can ignore that.
Oh, well this morning he got a call from who I think was our cousin Nathan, and frankly, it was a little more than I needed to know.
Oh, Carol and I have a new system. If she punches in 911, it means she's having a baby, otherwise I just ignore it.
What about Andre?
Hey.
That was gonna be my opener.
I just wanna say good-bye to you guys and to see if you guys will place a little bet for me, huh? Twenty bucks on black 15.
Hey!
Hey!
You got it!
All right!
...I'll go. Let's start with the way he kept picking at- no, I'm sorry, I can't do this, can't do this. We loved him.
Thanks. I'll call you tomorrow. Okay. Okay, let's let the Alan-bashing begin. Who's gonna take the first shot, hmm?
C'mon!
Loved him! Yeah! He's great!
Wait a minute! We're talking about someone that I'm going out with?
All right, fine! Fine! Have me fired! But uh, I want you to know that you and I are not all that different. I mean, I too am a neat guy.
Okay, please-please Paul, just let me explain...
No, let me explain! Fired!!
What?
And I too am just a love machine.
Well, yeah, of-of course I'm okay! What? I'm just being supportive. Supportive of you and this whole trip, and-and what-what is uh, what's this?
Are you into crafts at all?
Ross, are you okay?
It's a bathing suit?
To wear in front of people?
We got honourable mention in the brother/sister dance category! Look, it's almost fake midnight, do we really have any other choice?
Hey, when the snippy guy sees the routine, he'll wanna build us our own platform!
Was it really that good?
Okay, let's do it. Mom and Dad are gonna be so faced!
5 6 7 8!
That's right! Made expressly for Val Kilmer and worn by him in the hit film...that Batman film he was in.
No. Rachel hooked me up with a tux! But not just any tux, Batman's tux!
What?
You can't wear that! I'm wearing the famous tux! James Bond's tux!
So?
1987, the day after Christmas, at Sean McMahon's party. I played you one of my songs, y'know Interplanetary Courtship Ritual.
Hi!
Oh my God, sit down! Sit down! How long as it been since we've seen each other?
Oh yeah. Right. So now, are-do you, do you still do music?
Sometimes, you should come over sometime! I'll play you one of my other...
Oh no, no, no, wait, wait, Isabella. Don't, don't just dismiss this so fast. I mean this is a once in a lifetime opportunity...
Well, yeah, kinda. Um, but that's okay, see we have an understanding, um, see we each have this list of five famous people, so I'm allowed to sleep with you. No, no, no, it's flattery.
I'm sorry.
Yeah, for you. Is that the list?
Um, yeah.
Oh right. Right. Ooh, remember the time I uh, I pinned you down and tickled you 'til you cried? We're probably too old to do that now.
Thank God.
I guess the last time we really hung out was when our parents rented that beach house together.
I'll always remember that summer, because it's when I got all of these freckles.
Uh-huh! Uh-huh! And-and-and I'll always remember that summer because that's when I realized that we are related.
...And I read about these women trying to have it all, and I thank God 'Our Little Harmonica' doesn't seem to have that problem.
Don't listen to your mother. You're independent, and you always have been! Even when you were a kid... and you were chubby, and you had no friends, you were just fine! And you would read alone in your room, and your puzzles...
Look, there are people like Ross who need to shoot for the stars, with his museum, and his papers getting published. Other people are satisfied with staying where they are- I'm telling you, these are the people who never get cancer.
So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks?
Okay! Okay. Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby.
The big deal is I don't want naked, greasy strangers in my apartment when I want to kick back with a puzzle-beer! Cold beer.
Look, this is my home and I want to be able to come and go whenever I want!
Okay, I will find someplace else to do the rest of my appointments. I just don't know what the big deal is!
Hey Joey, what 'cha doing?
Sweepin'. Why? Turn you on?
So, um- so how's this, uh, how's this gonna work? Y'know, with us? Y'know, when, like, important decisions have to be made?
I dumped him.
Okay.
Give me a 'for instance'.
Well, uh, uh, I don't know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with the baby's name?
Of course he is! What, do you think I'd just use my son as-as an excuse? What kind of father do you think I am?
He's at a dinner party.
Is he really coming? Because I can see right into your apartment!
All right, sorry.
I gotta go make a fake Ben.
I'm sorry. But ah, hey, oh, somebody's off the phone, how 'bout a glass of wine by the fire, I could get it going again.
Okay, that's a fire. Oh yeah. Oh yeah.
Excuse me, I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to call you back, I've got a Schemp in my office. What are you doing?
Ross you're not listening to me, I don't have time to stop.
Come on Rach, you don't have what, ten minutes?
Do you remember the scene with, um, Jabba the Hut? Well Jabba had as, as his prisoner, um, Princess Leia.
Okay, umm. Did you ever see, um, Return Of The Jedi?
Yeah.
Oooh!
Princess Leia, was wearing this, um, gold bikini thing. It was pretty cool.
'Cause there's time to make up for that. We can do stuff together. You always wanted to go to that Colonial Williamsburg. How 'bout we do that?
No. Your mother really did the work. I was busy with the business. I wasn't around that much. Is that what this is about?
No, no, Dad, I was just wondering.
Thanks, Dad, really, I ju... you know, I just, I just needed to know, um... when did you start to feel like a father?
Oh, well, I, I guess it musta been the day after you were born. We were in the hospital room, your mother was asleep, and they brought you in and gave you to me. You were this ugly little red thing, and all of a sudden you grabbed my finger with your whole fist. And you squeezed it, so tight. And that's when I knew.
Oh-oh, okay, okay! If you don't mind I'm gonna the rest of my stuff, and relax, in my favourite shirt. You have a pleasant evening.
Oh, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah...
yeah-yeah-yeah!!
So, you're like a zillionaire?
And you're our age. You're our age.
I have shown you everything we have. Unless you want your mother to spend eternity in a lemon yellow pant-suit, go with the burgundy.
This one?
No.
You know, whatever we pick, she would've told us it's the wrong one.
You're right. We'll go with the burgundy.
Oh absolutely! It has been in my family for generations, and every bride who has worn it has had a long and happy life.
That ring? When my grandmother first came to this country, that ring and the clothes on her back were all she had with her.
So you might say, the ring is irreplaceable?
So you might say, it's a magic ring.
Yeah, the stripper stole it.
30 seconds on the clock. 5 questions wins the game. The lightning round begins...now! What is Joey's favorite food?
All right!
Come on!
Sandwiches!
Correct. Chandler was how old when he first touched a girl's breast?
I talked to Monica, look, I'm the one who made the choice. I'm the one who's making things change, so I should be the one to y'know, step back.
Hi.
Hi. What are you doing here? Isn't this against the rules?
Oh, Ross...
No, no, it's okay. Really. They're plenty of people who just see their sisters at Thanksgiving and just see their college roommates at reunions and just see Joey at Burger King. So is, is that better?
Uh.. uh.. Well, Joey and I had discussed getting in an early morning racquetball game. But, um, apparently, somebody overslept.
You don't kiss your friend's mom! Sisters are okay, maybe a hot-lookin' aunt... but not a mom, never a mom!
What are you guys doing out here?
Yeah, well, you don't have your racket.
No, no I don't, because it's being restrung, somebody was supposed to bring me one.
Wh-wh-what line? The line that prompted a student in my last class of the day to say uh, "Dude, don't you ever was your face?"
Nice. And by the way that uh, that line down my face?
What line?
All right, I'm sorry. I'm sorry I didn't tell you but you were so mad already!
Of course I was mad! I told you I-I hate this stuff! Okay? It-it's not funny!
What?! Look, we're trying to rebuild a relationship here, right. How am I supposed to do that here, without being totally honest with each other?
You think?! God, I, ah, I'm in hell. I mean what, what am I gonna do? Rachel's all like, 'I love you and, and let's work on this.' And all I can think about is, 'What is she gonna do? What is she gonna say?' when I tell her what I did.
Well, before we answer that, I think we should address the more important question. How dumb are you?
Look, Ross look, I'm on board about this totally honesty thing, I am, just not about stuff that's gonna get you in trouble.
He's right. Nobody's gonna benefit, and you're just gonna hurt her.
All right, the score is nine to eight in favor of the guys. Ladies if you miss this the game is theirs, pick your category.
Ready?
Uh-huh. Good luck.
It's All Relative!!
You don't have to shout everything.
Y'know, y'know I'm lookin' and I don't think anyone's home here. I say we just break the window, crawl through, and-and y'know explain later.
Yeah? I hope you're not thinking about cleaning the living room.
Man, I'm starving! What the hell was I thinking at dinner?! "Do you want soup or salad?" Both! Always order both!
Yeah? Really? No one's home?
I don't think so. Hello? When you get in there...
Hey-hey, since you're the 'fix-it' lady, here's a pickle, what do you do when the bride says she doesn't want to have the wedding at all?
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
Wait up!
She said that?!
Yeah.
Ooh! There's no way to do this without her? 'Cause I kinda all ready told her uh, it was, it was already taken care of.
No problem.
And we'll need you and Rachel to testify before a judge.
Of course you did. Look Ross, you can't get an annulment unless you and Rachel are both there.
Uh-ha, what about someone who looks like Rachel? I will think about the therapy.
I'm just glad I brought that extra pair of socks, y'know? I used them as mittens, I didn't want to touch a thing in that last place.
Actually, can I get some hot water with a little lemon? I think I strained my voice screaming in there. Does it have to be so loud?
I can't hear a word you're saying, my ears are ringing so bad.
How sad are we?
Yeah, I know.
Yeah! Oh yeah, you'll be fine! It-it'll be uh, just like bungy jumping. Y'know? But instead of bouncing back up you-you won't.
Ugh. Well, we're just gonna have to jump. Yeah. Now, we're gonna have to make sure to land to the right of that patch of ice, okay? Not hit the dumpster on the other side and uh, and try to avoid that-that weird brownish red stuff in the middle. So, when you get down there...you go up to the roof and you let me in.
Oh whoa-whoa wait a minute! I have to do it?!
What if I smack my head on the concrete?
Well, I'm gonna lie to you Joey, it's a possibility.
Well yeah! Someone sent us a basket at work once and people went crazy over those little muffins. It was the best day.
The small one.
What?! You-you actually thought that basket was gonna get you the apartment?
Your work makes me sad.
Oh man! I want that place so much!! I was so sure that was gonna work! There's twelve bucks I'll never see again!
Well yes, yes I have. In fact umm, just the other day Kristen and I were talking about how I've been married and how I have a son.
Much better.
So y'know Ross it's funny 'cause, you look familiar to me too. Have you ever been married?
Yeah, little Eric.
That's right! Wait no, Ben.
Okay, there are no stupid fights!! This isn't about the room, this is about what the room...represents! And unfortunately, this room could destroy you!!
No, I-I-I'm serious, okay? I mean, think about it. You move in, you start fighting over stupid game rooms, next thing y'know you break up!
Ross, you were right before, it was just a stupid fight about a room.
Yeah, I'm not so worried.
Yeah, no, me neither.
Ok, ok, you know what? I think you're very funny. Kudos on that hat joke. But, come on guy just, just give him back the hat.
No?
No.
Why should we?
Because it's a special hat. See he bought it 'cause he was feeling really down one day so he got the hat to cheer himself up, ya know. Now Chandler...
Okay. All right. So let's see, let's play from the trash can, to the lightpost. Right. Two hand touch, we'll kick off.
Sweetie, now I pick you.
You don't pick me! You're stuck with me!
All right people listen, I've got exactly twenty-eight minutes before I have to baste again.
Wow! Just like in the pros.
Well isn't there something you can do to earn a little extra money? I mean, can't-can't you pick up, I don't know, an extra shift here?
What's up with the greed Joe?
All right, look I'm sorry you guys, but it's just that I gotta get these new head shots made. And they're really expensive, y'know? I'm down to like three! Well, actually two 'cause one of 'em I kinda blackened in some teeth-Why did I do that?!
Or, y'know, I used to beg for money. Of course it helps if you've got y'know a little of this goin' on. Wow! I still have it!
Oh, wait! Wait! Don't you have an audition today? Yeah! Maybe you'll get that job!
Ohhh. Big boy, riding the bus--Hey, I have a question. How come it says Property of Human Services on his butt?
I'm here. How's my little boy? Want Daddy to change your diaper? So, did you have fun with Uncle Joey and Uncle Chandler today?
Oh, yeah, he rode the bus today.
You, you are gonna love this.
Will you hold Ben for a sec? Come here. Come here.
Well, pretty incredible according to the message she left you on my machine. Hey, Chandler, why is this woman leaving a message for you on my machine?
What are these, like famous chickens?
Hey, sorry I'm late. Congratulations, Mon. I'm not sorry I'm late. How incredible was my afternoon with Jade?
Oh, see, I had to tell her that my number was your number, because I couldn't tell her that my number was my number because she thinks that my number is Bob's number.
Hey, tell me again, what do I do when Mr. Roper calls?
Wait a minute, the house was built on radioactive waste, and an ancient Indian burial ground? That would never happen.
I don't want a ghost.
Well, nobody wants a ghost. But you've got one, because the house is sitting on an ancient Indian burial ground.
Okay, obviously you don't know much about the U.S. government.
Hey!
It's, it's, it's, uh, a totally diferent situation! It's, it's apples and oranges, it's, it's orthodontists and lesbi- I gotta go.
Please. If she said to you, "Ross, I want you on this couch, right here, right now," what would you say?
If it helps, I could slide over.
Where are you going?
I just have to go, all right? Do I need a reason? Huh? I mean I have things to do with my life, I have a jam packed schedule, and I am late- for keeping up with it. Okay?
Bec-Did you not hear me?! She's an assistant professor in the Linguistics department, okay? They're wild! Why do you want to come anyway?
What? I can't cancel on Joan!
Why not?!
Because! She's my cousin. I mean, we grew up together! We're family y'know? Well that's important to me.
Okay, all right, I'll take you. I'll go call Joan.
Marcel, Marcel, give Rossie the remote. Marcel. Marcel, you give Rossie the remote right now... Marce... you give Rossie the remote...
It doesnt matter. You dont dip your pen in the company ink.
Ross, your little creatures got the remote again.
Great.
Relax, I'll fix it.
I'm sorry. Ugh, Pheebs, you were, you were right about her. Y'know, she did try to use sex as a weapon! Yeah, I hurt my back a little.
Yeah, and y'know what? I don't give a tiny rat's ass.
Yeah, we're gonna go.
Oh. Y'know, he hums while he does other stuff to.
Yeah, were better off without them.
Yeah y'know what? Maybe-maybe you didn't mess up your audition because you suck, maybe you messed up because you care more about uh, your godson.
No really, I-I am! I feel bad!
Yeah? Well look Ross, you don't have to. Okay? It's not your fault I suck. I mean what kind of an actor can't even say, "Hmm, noodle soup."
What you do mean?
I think, sub-consciously...
Look, that has nothing to do with this, ok? She's my ex-wife. If she were marrying a guy, none of you'd expect me to be there.
Who's the bitterest man in the living room, the bitterest man in the living room? Hi, neighbor.
Ross, I thought you were over this.
Hey, if she were marrying a guy, she'd be like the worst lesbian ever.
Did I miss it? Did I miss it?
Oh okay, lift it straight up over your head! Straight up over your head! You can do it! You can do it! Okay. You got it?
Okay, go left. Left! Left!
Okay, y'know what? There is no more left, left!
Yeah.
Good-good-good.
Hey, y'know, Mon, if things wrong out between you and Richard's son, you'd be able to tell your kids, that you slept with their grandfather.
Is he okay in there?
He's fine!
Fine! Judge all you want to but, married a lesbian, left a man at the altar, fell in love with a gay ice dancer, threw a girl's wooden leg in a fire, livin' in a box!!
So now, what exactly is the point of the box?
Yeah, yeah, it'll be great! You can, you can lay on the beach and I can cry over my failed marriage. See-see how I make jokes?
Why don't you come, I mean, I-I have two tickets, why not?
Well-well, I don't know Ross-really?
Uh-huh.
No really, I mean, I mean, God, I could use a friend.
I know, uh, the air, the-the trees... even though Nana's gone there's, there's something almost, uh- I dunno, almost life-aff-
Oh, I hope they're not ruined.
God, what a great day. ...What? Weather-wise!
God! Ross!
I'm fine. Just-just... having my worst fear realised...
Don't be scared, I-I know it sounds crazy and-and people will say it's too soon, but just-just think, think how great it will be.
Move in with me.
What?!
Ohh, no. Ugh. Oh, leaving London, my whole family lives there.
I know.
That's different, okay. That's like, uh 'Who dated a stripper?' or 'Who did it on the back of the Staton Island Ferry?'.
Look, that was supposed to be like a private, personal thing between us.
Okay, Ross, Phoebe is my girlfriend, okay, we tell each other everything. You know, I mean, come on, guys do the same thing, I mean, what about all that locker room stuff.
Were both of those Joey?
Yeah. Look, you don't, you don't talk about like, you know, your girlfriend and the intimate stuff you, you do with her.
Well yeah, but she doesn't know that. I mean, the last time she saw you-you would've turned one of those little wedding chairs into kindling.
So I finally heard back from Aunt Sheryl and apparently it wasn't a mistake. Ahh, there's-there's limited seating in the hall.
Limited seating?! I am just one tiny person!
Limited seating! Oh, that is such a lame excuse! That's not the reason she's not inviting me!
Oh what's the big deal?! I wasn't even invited to the ceremony, just the reception. And-and y'know what? If it makes you feel any better, Joan and I will just make an appearance and then, and then we'll-we'll leave early as a sign of protest.
So listen uh, I know you and I haven't really had a chance to talk since uh, Emily and I decided to get married, and uh, I was just wondering how you were.
Hey, do uh, do you have a minute?
Yeah, yeah, I was just about to take a break anyways, so...
Oh.
I know if you were getting married I'd feel, kinda..... y'know.
Look, I know you don't want to hear this right now but, we've seen him in his new place, alright. And he's happy, he's, he's decorated.
I'm telling you, there's no way he's moving back.
But we had one of the greatest talks we ever had last night. I mean it was, it was like when we first started living together.
Look, Chandler, he has moved on, OK, you have to too.
But...
I made a man twice my size cry. I mean, I haven't done that since I was four and I washed my dad's Porsche with rocks.
Oh, I kinda was, wasn't I?
Oh my God!
You really enjoyed yourself didn't you?
Please! Are you kidding? I-I hurt three huge men, I gave a guy a bloody nose-I mean I-I'm not proud of it but, I really am. And it's all because of you, wonderful, amazing you.
Save the breakthroughs for therapy, okay. The clock is ticking. We have no time, and we are losing, we are losing to girls.
Nice going. You just saved yourself a couple months of sex.
Y'know what, it doesn't matter, 'cause she picked me. Me! From now on I get the dates and you have to stay home on Saturday nights watching Ready, Set, Cook!
We're not gonna lose to girls.
Hey! It's 42-21!
She's going in. Wait! He's going in! He's going in!! The door's closed! I, I can't see anything but the door closed!!
Here they come, here they come. Oh-ho, if she kisses him goodnight, I'm gonna kill myself, I swear. I can't, I can't watch this. Come on, date over! Date over! Uh-oh, here we go, she's going in.
Okay.
And the inventor of the door rests happily in his grave.
Okay, I have to do something. I mean, I have, I have to stop it!
Thanks. I know you guys like to give me a hard time and all, but it really means a lot to me that you like her. Just knowing that you guys are...
Well, actually it's been great. She's 20 so she's not looking for anything too serious, which is perfect for me right now.
Well that is great. And seriously, she seems very nice.
Okay, I got a good one. Okay, umm, what is she? Like 12?
Chandler, do you think we talk about our relationship enough?
Yeah, y'know the ah, the girlfriend I told you about last night? Well it turns out she ah, she wants to get back together with me. Oh, I found it!!
You, you sure you need shoes? Okay.
Do I know why we're rushing?
That's so great for you guys!
Yeah!
Maybe this would've happened if I'd been more nurturing, or I'd paid more attention, or I... had a uterus. I can't believe this!
Oh yeah, that sounds great. Oh, and listen, it's, it's gonna be....
I know. Thanks.
I know no, no, y'know you don't deserve this, you don't Ross. You're, you're really, you're so good.
Thanks.
Well, there's no way I'm gonna get a shot. Maybe they can take the needle and thquirt it into my mouth, you know, like a thquirt gun.
Well, but Pheebs.
No, huh uh, I'm sorry, no. No, I'm not some like sloppy second, charity band. You know what, there are thousands of places in this city where people would be happy to pay to hear me play. When I play, I play for me, I don't need your charity. Thank you! La la la la la la la....
Hello, there. I'm Dr. Carlin. I see someone's having an allergic reaction.
Doctor, can I see you for just a minute please? My brother has a slight phobia about needles.
That's right Lydia, Elizabeth here is a student and uh, we're dating. And you may frown upon that, but we're not gonna hide it anymore.
Hi!
Aren't you in my Popular Culture class?
You are so fired.
What?
Oh, yeah, that would be me, um, I have, I have a problem I-I tip way too much, way, way, too much, it's a sickness really.
The carbon, it's messy, I mean it gets on your fingers and causes, the, the ah, night blindness.
What is this? Who put a twenty down here? Huh?
Yeah it is, it is. We really, really have to do something about that.
I know.
Well, I don't know, it's-it's kinda in a place that's not... It's not visually accessible to me, and I was hoping maybe you guys could-could help me out.
No, no, I mean, I mean a thing on my body.
What was it?
Whoa!!!
No!!
Wait uh, listen. I-I, I have to tell you something. Umm, I've been thinking, I'm just gonna come out and say it. Okay? I-I-I ah, I-I think I love you.
This is the final boarding call for Flight 009.
Well, that' me. Here, have this. I'm only allowed one piece of carryon anyway.
Oh. Thank you.
That's no problem.
Listen, I know you wanted to talk to me, but I have an idea that may make you want to stay married. We register, and you get to keep all the presents!
Hey!
Hey!
No! Ross, come on! No! Listen, look I thought a lot about how to tell you this and the bottom line, Ross, is we can not stay married.
I don't know if it's true.
Oh yeah! You're-hey, you're right! Here's an affordable place, two bedroom, close to work, ooh, it's available in five weeks!
Well, I guess I can check out those apartment listings, even though there's never anything in here.
Not even on page 7?
What about that circled one?
Oh, I-I don't know, it's kind of expensive for a studio.
Wrong! Now you're single. It's actually secret option number three, you meet her at the gate. That way she knows you love her.
Okay, for instance. Let's say, Janice is coming back from a trip and she gives you two options. Option number 1 she'll take a cab home from the airport. Option 2 is you can meet her at baggage claim. Which do you do?
That's easy, baggage claim.
Okay, this is good, this is good. All right listen, I have one. Janice likes to cuddle, at night, which, you know I'm all for. But, uh, you know when you want to go to sleep, you want some space. So, uh, how do I tell her that without, you know, accidentally calling her fat or something.
Oh honey, I'm sorry we can't help you there, 'cause we're cuddlily sleepers. Okay, I'm late for work.
Look at that, look at that, see how she's pushing him away and he won't budge. Alright, I'm gonna do something. Excuse me, are you Rachel?
Would you look at that guy, I mean how long has he been talking to her. It's like, back off buddy she's a waitress not a geisha.
I think she's OK.
What?
I'm Ross Geller. Wha, I'm, God in your add you said you were pretty but wow.
A little? Your place looks like page 72 of the catalogue. Oh look at that! The ornamental bird cage! Large!
Wow! I didn't know that there was a Pottery Barn up here.
I know, I know. I went a little crazy.
Hey!
Hey.
Umm, he said he thought I was funny. So... Okay, look-look umm, let's just go downstairs, we'll have some fun, and you will forget all about it.
Yes, hello. I have a question. Umm, I used your pen to draw on my friend's face. A beard and a moustache. Thank you. No, she didn't think so. I know it's like anyway, umm well make-up didn't cover it and we've tried everything to get it off and nothing's worked. What-what do we do? Yeah. Uh-huh. Yeah. Oh! Okay. Okay, thank you! Yeah, it's not coming off.
What?! What else did he say?
Ross, no! There is no way I am leaving this room looking like this!
Oh, come on! Rach, it's-it's not that bad.
No! No! I'm not! It's-it's-it's perfect! I mean it's better than you just-just moving here, 'cause it's us together forever, and that's-that's what I want.
Get married.
You are mad!
We've only known each other for six weeks!
Yeah, I know, so what? I mean, who's-who's to say? Does that me we-we can't do it? Look, huh, I was with Carol for four years before we got married and I wound up divorced from a pregnant lesbian. I mean, this, this makes sense for us. Come on! I mean, on our first date we ended up spending the whole weekend in Vermont! I mean, last night I got my ear pierced! Me! This feels right. Doesn't it?
Why should Ben step aside? It was his audition in the first place! You-you just tagged along! You're like the uh, tag-a-long dad.
What? Chandler! Tell 'em!
Well I mean, let me get the door first. Oh, hi! No one.
At least I care about his feelings!
What?!
Would you look at that guy, I mean how long has he been talking to her. It's like, back off buddy she's a waitress not a geisha.
Chandler, Chandler.
I pity the fool who puts on my jewelry, I do, I do. I pity the fool that. . . Hi. Hey man, we were just doin' some uhh, impressions over here. Do your Marcel Marceau. That's actually good.
I think she's OK.
Look at that, look at that, see how she's pushing him away and he won't budge. Alright, I'm gonna do something. Excuse me, are you Rachel?
You have 30 seconds. And the lightning round begins-stop it -now. What was Monica's nickname when she was a field hockey goalie?
Okay.
Okay.
Big fat goalie.
Correct. Rachel claims this is her favorite movie...
Don't sweat it, I've got this section covered. Yeah, in fact I've got this little baby to shine in people's eye--Okay, see you later.
I mean, I realize that his feelings may never completely go away, but you can.
Oh...my Gawd, I-I understand. I-I am so sorry, I'll go. Good-bye Monica , I wish you a lifetime of happiness with him. Chandler, you call me when this goes in the pooper.
I just wanted to show Monica your book.
Hey everybody! Happy Thanksgiving!
Pheebs, come on, you didn't kill anybody, these people just happened to die when you went to the dentist. It's, it's, it's just ah, a coincidence.
And all these people actually died?
Yes, while I was in the chair! That's why I take such good care of my teeth now, y'know, it's not about oral hygiene, I floss to save lives!
Well tell that to them. Oh! You can't, their dead.
Thanks, Gunther. Hey! Umm, can I get a napkin too?
Now, if you wanna try to make some of it back, I'd be glad to play you for it. But I should warn you, I am very good at Cups.
I'm sorry you lost your money, but I won it fair and square.
At a fake game!!
Okay! Now I assume the Saucer card came up when you played last.
No.
I'm hurt! I'm actually hurt, that you would think that I would send you any of those things out of any thing other than love. Hurt! Hurt!
It's nice to have a boyfriend.
Your loyal loving boyfriend Ross..... Ross!
All right Ross!! I get it!!
I mean my God...
Oh, just hold on a second. I'm watching this rugby thing on ESPN. I don't know what the big deal is. I'm man enough to play this sport.
Oh my God, that's so freaky! Turn him off!!
Ooh, hey, could we put on the news? I think it might be raining.
Dude, you're not even man enough to order the channel that carries the sport.
Hey there Ross!
No, no, that's not where I was going. Er, if you get in the... way, of us becoming a thing, then I would be, well, very sad.
No, no, no. Technically the... sex is not... being had, but that's... see, that's not the point. See, um, the point is that... Rachel and I should be, er, together. You know, and if you get in the.... um...
Bed?
Oh!
Yeah! Se vice?
Seven years. I mean we've been together seven years, she's the only woman who's ever loved me, and the only woman I've-I've ever....
Well, now I do!!
I'm sorry.
Aw, God Ross. Oh.
Umm, this is nice.
Well, when you're subletting an apartment from your wife's cousin and then you get a divorce, sometimes the cousin suddenly wants his apartment back.
What?!
Why?
How can he do that? Didn't you sign a lease?
Who needs a lease when it's family!
I don't know, I could maybe go out for a couple of beers, but there's this thing about bumblebees on The Discovery Channel that I was planning to watch.
Oh.
Hey, you guys! Hey, Ross, quick question for ya. Are you ready to party?
No-no, I don't think you heard me. Are you ready to party?!
Nooo!! Gandolf?! Gandolf is coming to town?
Look, you guys I just wanna say, I really, really appreciate you spending this time with me. It's been a pretty hard time right now, so I just wanna say thanks.
Hey, can you close that window Chandler? My nipples can cut glass over here!
Wait. Really?! 'Cause mine get me out of tickets.
Can somebody else hug him? I have to stay by the window.
Oh hey, hey, huh, how about this weekend we have a laser disc marathon okay, and maybe a tournament on my new dart board? Huh, huh, what do you think? Two days of darts, it'll be great!
I just, I don't understand, I mean, how-how can she do this? Y'know, what, am I, am I like a complete idiot for thinking that she'd actually show up?
Pretty soon I guess.
Yeah. I'm sorry.
No, you're not an idiot, Ross. You're a guy very much in love.
Same difference.
Yeah! They're putting together this panel to talk about these fossils they just found in Peru and The Discovery Channel's gonna film it!
I'm gonna be on TV!!
No way!
Oh my God! Who's gonna watch that?!
Thanks. You ready to go?
Yeah, ooh yeah, I think there is one from batch 17 left, uh... It's batch 16! 16 people! Get out of the way!
Oh yeah! Batch 17 was good. I did not like batch 16. I'm okay.
Are there anymore from the good batch? 'Cause we could just work off of those.
Okay Joey honey, you're doing really good! All right, now I'm just gonna need you to step to the port side. Remember? Remember how we talked about the port side?
Ohh yeah.
Well, I do! Why don't we go back to my place, light a couple of candles, break open a box of Cinnamon Fruit Toasties, uh...
Uh... Oh hey, do you, uh ...do you have any, um, Cinnamon Fruit Toasties?
What?
I'd rather not.
Oh, yeah, why not?
No real-, honey, really it's fine, just g-go with Susan. Really, I, no, I think girls night out is a great idea. Okay, okay, bye
Bye!
Bye! Ten bucks says, I never see that woman again in my life.
So what are they doing?
I don't know, something girlie.
Or you can sit with him on the front porch and make sure no one steals the trash cans. He does that every week too.
No, I-I thought it would be more fun this way.
This is so cool, maybe this is something you can do every week.
Oh, just so you know, you-you have to let him win.
Yeah.
Wow! It actually is in the handbook. I can't date you or have a hot plate in my office. I can't believe we have to stop seeing each other.
Yeah.
God, what a mess.
For what it's worth I did appreciate you standing up for me. It felt really nice. It kinda made me like you even more.
I know, I know I really like you too. But we-we can't date. It's against the rules. It's forbidden.
Right, um, but, on Hanukkah, Hanukkah is a celebration of a miracle. See, years and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees.
Yes, but also Hanukkah! See, you're part Jewish, and-and Hanukkah is a Jewish holiday.
Santa has reindeers that can fly!
Jingle bells, jingle bells...
Okay, that's right, yes, but on Hanukkah, uh, we sing, uh Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, I made you out of clay.
Yup! You could plunk me down in the middle of any woman's uterus, no compass, and I can find my way out of there like that!
Aunt Syl, stop yelling! All I'm saying is that if you had told me vegetarian lasagna, I would have made vegetarian lasagna. Well, the meat's only every third layer, maybe you could scrape.
Ross, did you really read all these baby books?
Ooh, this is cool...it says in some parts of the world, people actually eat the placenta.
And, we're done with the yogurt.
Yeah, ever since you uh, told me that story about that bike I-I couldn't stop thinking about it. I mean, everyone should have a-a first bike, so...
Mine stole my newspaper! It's like a crime wave!! Pheebs, you uh, you got a second.
Sure!
Oh my God Ross!!
You like it?
Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me.
Kinda puts that whole pillow thing in perspective, huh, Mon?
Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing?
She is so great! I miss her.
What does she mean by 'involved'?
Could ya just, could ya just lay off, please? All right? My life is an embarrassment! I should go live under somebody's stairs!
Bye.
Hmm, something bad to tell Rachel... Bad news for Rachel, what could that be?!
Ross, it's not that big a deal! So you'll been divorced three times, you'll still have a life, you'll go on dates...
No! No, I won't! I'll be at the bottom of the dating barrel now. The only guys below me will be Four Divorce Guy uh, Murderer Guy, and-and, Geologists.
No! No! Of course it didn't mean anything! I mean, uh well, I can understand why Emily would think it meant something, y'know, because-because it was you...
Oh no! It could be better, but it's gonna be okay, right?
Oh yeah! Of course, I mean, she's gonna get over this, y'know? I mean, so you said my name! Y'know you just said it 'cause you saw me there, if you'd have seen a circus freak, you would've said, "I take thee circus freak." Y'know, it didn't mean anything, it's just a mistake. It didn't mean anything. Right?
Right...
But it absolutely didn't. It didn't!! It didn't!!
Pheebs, you're talking about putting your body through an awful lot, I mean morning sickness, uhh, labour, and it's all for somebody else!
Yeah, like you're gonna be pregnant. I mean pregnant.
I know!
Yeah, what's your point?
Well, the stuff I just mentioned.
Uh, excuse me. Evolution is not for you to buy, Phoebe. Evolution is scientific fact, like, like, like the air we breathe, like gravity.
Too easy? Too...The process of every living thing on this planet evolving over millions of years from single-celled organisms, too easy?
Yeah, I just don't buy it.
Ok, don't get me started on gravity.
You uh, you don't believe in gravity?
I'm here. How's my little boy? Want Daddy to change your diaper? So, did you have fun with Uncle Joey and Uncle Chandler today?
Hey, he's not crying.
Yes! There's still pie.
Oh, yeah, he rode the bus today.
Ohhh. Big boy, riding the bus--Hey, I have a question. How come it says Property of Human Services on his butt?
That's impossible! I mean we have had a deal for years! We-we-we shook on it, although believe me she wanted to do a lot more than that.
Ohh, I don't think so.
Ross! I just had a conversation with her, and she said that she and Joey made a deal!
Where the hell have you been?!
I was making a coconut phone with the professor.
The point is I... I don't need this right now, OK. It, it's too late, I'm with somebody else, I'm happy. This ship has sailed.
Not, not, not every night. You know, and... and it's not like I didn't try, Rachel, but things got in the way, y'know? Like, like Italian guys or ex-fiances or, or, or Italian guys.
Hey, there was one Italian guy, OK, and do you even have a point?
Yeah, what're you saying, you just sort of put away feelings or whatever the hell it was you felt for me?
Hey, I've been doin' it since the ninth grade, I've gotten pretty damn good at it.
Wait, did you get to the part about his 'huge throbbing pens'? Tell ya, you don't wanna be around when he starts writing with those!
You usually find them on the 'heaving beasts'.
Alright, alright, so I'm not a great typist...
Alright, that's it! Give it back! That's it!
Nooo!
You guys, you know what, you know what, it doesn't matter, because you both have to go get dressed before the big vain in my head pops. So..
The big deal is I was sitting there last, so, that's my seat.
Well, actually the last place you were sitting was in there . Soo...
All right, Ross, I just have to do one thing, really quickly, it's not a big deal. GET UP!!
Hi.
Okay. Now-now-now should I climb down your front so we're face to face or-or should I climb down your back so we're-we're butt to face.
Okay, I'm going to start climb down you now.
All right! Just hurry up!
I think face to face.
I would say that.
Okay, okay. Enough, enough with the lunging. No! I'm sick of this. Okay. I've had it up to here with you two! Neither you can come to the party!
Oooo-ooh!
Yeah. Whew, it's hot with all of this stuff on. I ah, I better not do any, I don't know, lunges.
Jeez, what a baby.
Yeah, Ross, way to ruin it. I was just going to get dressed.
Not the first two, but the second two- woooo! ...I love you guys. You guys are the greatest. I love my sister , I love Pheebs...
I feel great. I feel- great, I fleel great.
Wow, those pills really worked, huh?
Ooh! That's so nice...
...Chandler!
Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh, by the by, did it uh, did it ever occur to you that, I don't know, maybe they might be having a little too much fun?
So umm, any word from Susan?
Ooh, yeah! She said she's having sooo much fun with Emily.
What's too much fun?
Y'know, the kind of fun, you and Susan had when we were married.
No, its...Its not that. Umm, now what I'm going to say to you, I'm not saying as your friend. Okay? I'm-I'm saying as it as Monica's older brother.
Well this uh, this may be a little awkward.
Listen, if you want to borrow money, its kind of a bad time. I'm buying dinner for 128 people tomorrow night.
But you're still my friend?
Not for the next few minutes.
Wait a minute, one box! Come on, I'm trying to send a little girl to Spacecamp, I'm putting you down for five boxes. Chandler, what about you?
...and these come in the shapes of your favourite Christmas characters, Santa, Rudolph, and Baby Jesus.
All right, I'll take a box of the cream filled Jesus's.
Ahh, do you have any coconut flavoured deities?
No, but ah, there's coconut in the Hanukkah Menoreoes. I tell you what, I'll put you down for eight boxes, one for each night.
Oh, that'd be great! Okay, but if you do, make sure it seems like you're there to see him, okay, and you're not like doing it as a favour to me.
I didn't wanna leave him alone. Alright? We- we had our first fight this morning. I think it has to do with my working late. I said some things that I didn't mean, and he- he threw some faeces...
Y'know, if you're gonna work late, I could look in on him for you.
Okay, but if he asks, I'm not going to lie.
...But, you can't actually test this theory, because today's particle accelerators are nowhere near powerful enough to simulate these conditions.
Yeah! I don't know. I mean, last year Elizabeth now-now this kid. What-what-what-what is it?! Am I giving out some kind of...sexy professor vibe?
I do-I do not have a boyfriend. There's a guy in one of my classes who-who has a crush on me.
Really?
Not right now.
It-it-The point is my natural charisma has made him fail his midterm.
Uh actually, I sent the flowers before the actual date. So techincally, technically I didn't break any rules. Thanks for stopping by though.
That's right.
You spent a hundred dollars. That's the limit. You're screwed!
Oh-oh! So that's the way it's gonna be huh? Yeah I can break the rules too y'know!
Oh yeah? What are you gonna do?
Oh! Listen umm, I, I just stopped by to see if you wanted to see this play tonight. Umm, it's supposed to be excellent. The director is the same...
Oh, you have to call the police! That's what I did to the kids in my building!
No, it's a water balloon fight! We started it!
Who drank all the Kamikazes?
Nobody! We put them in here!
Turns out them Emily is just crazy about Susan. Yeah, they're going to the theatre together! They're going to dinner! They're going horseback riding!
So uh, Emily called last night...
And now you're giving me the message!
God, Susan is so fun!
Look, this is just a little too familiar, okay? For like, for Like six months before Carol and I spilt up, all I heard was "My friend Susan is so smart. My friend Susan is so funny. My friend Susan is so great."
Look, don't worry about me. Okay? I'll just stay real energetic and stay away from the ball. I'll uh, I'll be that guy right out of the circle.
All right, come on look, Ross can take care of himself! It's not like he's...Chandler!
Thanks!
Oh!
Oh, well maybe there was a dog lookin' at him.
That's nice... now, was that before or after you told him to stop calling, stop sending you flowers and to generally leave you alone, hmm?
Not a good day for birds...
Then we took a walk down to Bendall's, and I told him not to, but he got me a little bottle of Chanel...
Right,.. well,.. we never actually got to that... Oh, it was just so nice to see him again, y'know? It was comfortable, it was familiar... it was just nice!
That's, that's nice twice!
Shh! Here we come, walkin' down the street, get the funniest looks from, everyone we meet. Hey, hey! Hey, uh, did you just feel that?
Oh, please. I am not singing to your stomach, ok?
Hi, how's it goin?
I did.
Does it always, uh--?
What? Oh! I gotta tell you, I-I wasn't expecting to like her at all, I mean I actually wasn't expecting to like anyone right now, but she's really terrific.
Four, please. I'm really nervous. Thank you.
So Ross, how umm, how did it go with Bonnie?
Ohh, that's too bad!
No, I-I'm saying I liked her.
Okay look, do-do, you have anything Christmassy? I promised my son, and I really don't want to disappoint him, um, come on, I...uh, you gotta have something.
Well, uh, do you have a Santa-outfit left?
Two days before Christmas? Sorry, man.
I'm the holiday armadillo! I'm a friend of Santa's and he sent me here to wish you a Merry Christmas!
What happened to Santa, Holiday Armadillo?
You? You! Want to watch Ben? Yes! That'd be great, no, I just wanted to ask Monica, because I know how empty her life is.
Yes, that's what I was going to ask, thank you.
Whoa! Wait! Hello! What about me?
Hey-hey, Ross?
Yeah.
First of all it's Professor Pittain! And second of all, that little bone, proved that, that particular dinosaur had wings, but didn't fly.
Come on! Forty-five minutes! Forty-five minutes the man talked about strappy backed dresses.
Well okay, how about four hours in a freezing museum auditorium listening to Professor Pitstains and he's 'Hey everybody! Remember that thing that's been dead for a gazillion years. Well there's this little bone we didn't know it had!'
Okay, see now, what I just heard, blah-blah-blah, blah-blah-blah-blah-blah, blah-blah-blah, blah, blah.
Y'know what, 100 million people went to see a movie about what I do, I wonder how many people would go see a movie called, Jurassic Parka.
Hey uh Mon, I saw the Porsche parked out front, can I get the keys? Thought I'd take that bad boy out for a little spin.
Hey!
Hey!
Wait a minute! You let Ross drive the Porsche and when I ask you, you say you're the only one who's allowed to drive it.
Yeah, well he's my brother! And plus he drives so slow he could never hurt it.
I've seen her at work, but I always figured, ah-huh? But, uh, I made her dinner. We had a great time. And we're going out again tomorrow.
Actually she's a paleontology doctoral candidate, specializing in the centazoic era.
Okay, but that's, like, the easiest era.
Well maybe she and her friends are just having a contest to see who can bring home the biggest geek.
Fine by me; hope she wins.
Marcel is an illegal exotic animal. I'm not allowed to have him in the city. If they find him, they'll take him away from me.
You called Animal Control?
Uh-huh... why... do you not like them?
O-okay, now see, you never ever ever told us that...
That's right, I.. 'cause I didn't expect you were gonna invite them to the apartment!
Ok, Pheebs. See how I'm making these little toys move? Opposable thumbs. Without evolution, how do you explain opposable thumbs?
Mmmmm.
Ok, while you "mmm" on it for awhile, I'm gonna go find a place for my new lamp.
Maybe the overlords needed them to steer their spacecrafts.
Please tell me you're joking.
Oh, oh my God, is this the wrong day? I don't believe it, uh, well, hey, I guess if it works out we'll, we'll have something to tell the grandkids.
I'm Ross Geller. Wha, I'm, God in your add you said you were pretty but wow.
What are you, what are you doin'?
Sure will. I've uh, gotta go. Take care.
OK, see ya later, nice meeting you. You're welcome.
Even though you do do a good Bob impression, I'm thinkin' when she sees you tomorow, she's probably gonna realize, "hey, you're not Bob."
Great, I'll see you then.
Ok. Ok. Having a phone has finally paid off.
I'm hoping that when Bob doesn't show up, she will seek comfort in the open arms of the wry stranger at the next table.
Oh my god. You are pure evil.
I just feel like someone reached down my throat, grabbed my small intestine, pulled it out of my mouth and tied it around my neck...
This guy says hello, I wanna kill myself.
Are you okay, sweetie?
Cookie?
Carol moved her stuff out today.
No! For all I know, she's trying to find me but couldn't because I kept moving around. No, from now on, I'm staying in one place. Right here.
Or 45.
Wow, in 45 minutes you can find her twice.
Well, it's getting late.
Yeah, we're gonna go.
Wait a minute! I saw that! On The Discovery Channel, yeah! About jellyfish and how if you... Ewwww!! You peed on yourself?!
And then Joey remembered something.
I'd seen this thing on The Discovery Channel...
Ewwww!!
You can't say that!! You-you don't know!! I mean I thought I was gonna pass out from the pain! Anyway I-I tried, but I-I couldn't...bend that way. So...
Well, ahem... you know, by the time we'd finished with all the dirty talk, it was kinda late... and we were both kind of exhausted, so uh...
I was the James Michener of dirty talk. It was the most elaborate filth you have ever heard. I mean, there were characters, plot lines, themes, a motif... at one point there were villagers.
Whoa! And the... huh-huh?
You cuddled.
Yeah, which was nice.
Sure. Sure. Look I don't, I don't know if your plans are finalized yet, but umm, hey I-I know another great way to blow off steam.
I'm so glad you're going on this trip!
Yeah! I've been working so hard this semester. I really need to go crazy y'know, blow off some steam.
What?
Are you into crafts at all?
Actually, it kinda is. My wife won't return my calls. I don't know where my wife is. "Hey Ross, where's the Mrs.?" Don't know!
Well, well I am married. Even though I haven't spoken to my wife since the wedding.
I'm sorry, that's not funny.
Oh God, ohh, okay, y'know what, do you think ah, do you think that you just forget that I told you this?
Well, I kinda half to. I mean, because the thing is...
Oh yeah it will! Come on, up! Up-up-up! Up! Yes! Here we go! Pivot! Pivot! Piv-ot! Piv-et!! Piv-ett!!! Piv-et!
Okay, I don't think we can turn anymore!
Ross, I don't, I just don't think it's going to fit.
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!!
Okay, I don't think it's going to pivot anymore.
Come here. Listen, you deserve so much better than him...you know, I mean, you, you, you should be with a guy who knows what he has when he has you.
You all right?
Ooh, I've been better...
Oh, Ross...
What?
Hey, if they have a ball maybe you can stick razor blades in it and teach them a new game, Gonna Need Stitches Ball.
Yeah, okay, I'll see you later.
Oh hey! There's some kids playing in the street, you wanna go down there and give them a project, ruin their day?
Hey guys! I was at the library all morning and I already finished my five pages for today!
Yay!
Ow! Ow! Okay, okay, fine, fine! All right, you wanna win by cheating, go ahead, all right. Phoebe the touchdown does count, you win.
Oh-ho, okay.
Dead leg!!
Woo-yay!!
No! Listen, I'm not gonna go through this with you again, okay. Just once I wanna beat when you can't blame it on the broken nose, the buzzer, or the fact that you thought you were getting mono. Let's just call this, tie score and it's halftime.
Yes, yes it is! No, but it's good it's-Emily thinks we should get all new stuff. Stuff that's just ours, together. Y'know brand new.
Oh, umm, I'm just getting rid of a couple of things.
This is all of your things.
So basically, this is a getting-rid-of-everything-Rachel-ever-used sale.
Touched. Used. Sat on. Sleep on.
No, I-I-I'm serious, okay? I mean, think about it. You move in, you start fighting over stupid game rooms, next thing y'know you break up!
That's very funny!
He's being silly, because he knows that we enjoy the silliness!
Ross, you were right before, it was just a stupid fight about a room.
Okay, there are no stupid fights!! This isn't about the room, this is about what the room...represents! And unfortunately, this room could destroy you!!
Apparently, he told Johnny Shapiro that she's quite a girl. In fact, he told Johnny that he thinks he's falling in love with her.
I know. He's like a new man. It's like a scene from Cocoon.
I just never would have pictured Richard with a bimbo.
Really.
I tell you, I've never seen him this happy.
Well l-look okay, it's probably just a mistake. Let me call Aunt Sheryl okay? Maybe you are invited and the invitation just got lost in the mail.
My God, I can't believe this! I mean I knew that mom and dad were invited, but I thought that was it! I mean from the ages 7 to 9 Frannie and I were inseparable!
Well, maybe since the age of 9, Frannie's made some new friends.
Yeah, well you call her and tell her that y'know when we were kids her precious little Frannie tried to undress me several times, okay? And if I hadn't have stopped her, there probably wouldn't even be a wedding to go too.
Y'know, she tried to undress me too.
Thanks you guys, I really appreciate this. All right, I'm gonna get packing again. Man, I've been moving around so much I'm beginning to feel like a nomad.
You got it.
Okay.
What?
He thought you said gonad.
No-no-no, no, umm, actually American surprise parties are-are-are very short. It's usually, "Surprise!" And then, "Oh my God, I'm so surprised-good-bye!"
Yeah, but we-we have to be at the Four Seasons for drinks in 15 minutes and then y'know, then The Plaza for dinner.
So why did you plan a party at the same time?
But Ross, I'm such having a great time! Your sister has just been telling me that you used to dress up like little, old ladies and hold make-believe tea parties.
Monica said that did she?
You want me to take some girl I've never met to the opera so you can go to a club and flirt with some guy, hmm, that-that is a toughie.
I think she's here.
No! Wait! Wait-wait! Ross, please!
Ohh, she's looking down the hall. Oh! She looked right at me! Oh wait, you can't see people through that little hole, can you? Hello!
Hello!
Yeah, hi, I was just beeped. No, Andr is not here. Third time today. Yes, I'm sure... No, sir. I don't perform those kind of services.
Oh, oh. Oh, oh. Oh this is it. Oh my god it's baby time. Baby time.
All right, relax, relax. Just relax, just relax. Be cool, be cool.
Services? Oh, services.
Yeah, you want 55-JUMBO. Yeah, that's right. That's right, JUMBO with a U, sir. No, belive me, you don't want me. Judging by his number, I'd be a huge disappointment. All rightie, bye bye.
I'm sorry I had to take such drastic measures to make my point, but I-look, I just want you guys to be safe. DANGER!!!!! Ahhh, huh? Unagi.
Perhaps. Now I'm curious, at what point during those girlish screams would you have begun to kick my ass?
All right, so we weren't prepared!
2,000 bucks is a lot of money. Oh, I wish I had a twin. Where could I find someone who looks exactly like me?
Hey.
Oh, come on you guys; that's funny! Y'know? Because he's need-he's got like a hearing aide y'know, 'cause-'cause y'know, 'cause he's all old, and...
Okay, okay. Uh, well uh, Rachel is going to need to yell sweet nothings in his ear.
Ross.
Okay look, Ross, just so you know that since Lizzie likes you so much, I've decided to accept the fact that you're going out with her.
Really? That okay, that's great.
Yeah, but it didn't fit. Well, luckily there's a store here that has one left in her size, but I'm the groom, I'm not supposed to see the dress...
Yeah-oh! Hey listen umm, Emily found this wedding dress in London...
Already?!
I'll pick it up for you!
Thank you.
Ok, well then get some sense. I mean it took you what, 10 years to get that job, who knows how long it's gonna be till you get another.
But I don't know it. What I do know is that you owe $2300 at Isn't it Chromantic.
Hey Ross, I'm aware of what I owe.
Look, I don't wanna hear this right now.
Huh, I'm just saying...
Well, see? So, maybe it wasn't such a bad idea, y'know, me kissing your mom, uh? Huh? But.. we don't have to go down that road.
Well, howdya feel?
Pretty good! I told her.
Okay. Now this is just the first chapter, and I want your absolute honest opinion. Oh, oh, and on page two, he's not 'reaching for her heaving beasts'.
What's a 'niffle'?
"There are three primary theories concerning sediment flow rate. Each of these theories can be further subcategorized into two distinct..."
Hey uh, well, today's my first lecture and I kinda wanted to try it out on you guys, do you, do you mind?
Oh that'd be great. Sure!
Oh, this is it. This what's gonna kill me.
"...subcategories. The first of these subcategories is..."
You have to tell her! You have to tell her! It's your moral obligation, as a friend, as a woman, I think it's a feminist issue! Guys? Guys?
Thanks Rach.
So what are you gonna do?
Oh, yeah, you have to tell her.
Feminist issue. That's where I went!
Well, I wanted to be thorough. I mean this-this is clearly very, very important to you, to us! And so I wanted to read every word carefully, twice!
Done!
You just finished?
So umm, does it?
I'm sorry.
No, actually I was just saying it looks like we're not sitting together. But now you mention it, there was ice there that night... It was the first frost...
Sorry, sorry... Uh-oh.
What? There was ice there that night with Carol? Plastic seats? Four thousand angry Pittsburgh fans?
C'mon, sit. Just sit down, sit.
You should feel great about yourself! You're doing this amazing independence thing!
I'm sorry, my pie was, was in your hood. Now I just have to get the coffee out of that guy's pants and I'll be back in the hospital by 7.
Pie in the hood, pie in the hood. Go.
What're you doing?
Damnit Ross, get your butt out of the bathroom.
Calm down, I'm blow drying.
The photo album! There were millions of pictures of the apartment in the photo album. We just go through it and match everything to the pictures.
Dude, what'd you have?
Look, we have no time okay? We must focus. We gotta get everything back into its original place.
That's perfect! That's brilliant!
So really, what'd ya have?
Chandler, can I just say something? I-I know you're still mad at me, I just wanna say that there were two people there that night. Okay? Two sets of lips.
Yeah, I believe I was talking to Joey, alright there, Mother-Kisser?
Mother-Kisser... I'll shut up.
Yes, well, I expect this from her. Okay? She's always been a Freudian nightmare.
Okay, well, if she always behaves like this, why don't you say something?
Look I-I don't know what's going on with you and your husband and what is hopefully an adult dog walker, look can I just say not all men are like that.
Didn't you spend last night at Joey's?
Aw what are you?! A detective?
Oh.
Hey! There are some men who will do whatever it takes to make their marriage work! Okay? There are some men who will stand by and-and watch as their wives engage in-in what only can be described as a twosome with some-some woman she barely knows from the gym!
Look, Chandler, it's my joke. But, hey, if it makes you feel any better they don't print the name, so it doesn't really matter who gets credit, right?
Seriously?
Well, you tell a lot of jokes!
Yeah, I guess.
Hey guys.
Well, OK, I uh, I have to. I can't deal with this right now. I mean, I've uh, y'know, I've got a cab, I've got a girlfriend, I'm... I'm gonna go get a cat.
I'll be right down.
Wait, so, you're going?
OK, OK.
Cat.
Grab a spoon. Do you know how long it's been since I've grabbed a spoon? Do the words 'Billy, don't be a hero' mean anything to you?
We are gathered here today to join Joanne Louise Cunningham and Charles, Chachi-Chachi-Chachi, Arcola in the bound of holy matrimony.
Oh...see... but Joanne loved Chachi! That's the difference!
Great story! But, I uh, I gotta go, I got a date with Andrea--Angela--Andrea... Oh man,
Angela's the screamer, Andrea has cats.
No, it turns out that the one from uptown was making a joke. But it was a different joke than I thought-it wasn't that funny. So I'm still torn.
The one with the cat. I gotta go, I've got another date.
So, did you pick one yet?
Well look, you don't really like the one from uptown and you're too exhausted from dating the one up in Poughkeepsie, so I say you just end them both. Okay? You take a train up to Poughkeepsie and break up with her, and on your way back you break up with uptown. And then by the time you get home tonight, you're done!
Y'know, you're right. Thank you.
You know what? You know what? If, things were the other way around, there's nothing you could put on a list that would ever make me not want to be with you.
No, but, but I wanna be with you in spite of all those things.
Oh, well, that's, that's mighty big of you, Ross. I said don't go!
Well, then, I guess that's the difference between us. See, I'd never make a list.
I never know how long you're supposed to wait in this type of a situation before you can talk again, you know? Maybe a little longer.
I don't know what to say, I'm sorry. Though, you're not supposed to take these. It's like a million years old, we, we actually, we had people looking for that.
That sounds like another word to me! Are you gonna take this seriously? Okay.
Don't say that I have no sentiment! This is a movie stub from our first date! This is an eggshell from the first time you made me breakfast in bed! This is from the museum from the first time we... were together. Okay, maybe I exchange gifts sometimes, but I keep the things that matter!
Ooh, this always happens.
Here, let me help.
Well, so, you-you'll get a job here! I mean, I'm always hearing about uh, them foreigners coming in here and stealing American jobs; that could be you!
I know.
My job!
Yeah, but it-it-it's my whole life-you come to England.
No, I can't. I would, I really would, but my son is here; I can't leave him. Isn't-you don't think there's any way?
No the-the sad thing is, if you had told him how you felt before you kissed her, knowing Joey, he probably just would've just stepped aside.
No. Is there anyway, anyway you think he'll understand this?
You obviously haven't screwed over a lot of your friends. Which we all appreciate.
Oh, don't say that! Don't say that. That's not true. Is it?
I think maybe, yeah.
There you go. So she dips into her savings, that's what it's there for. She's gonna be fine, and if you need a little extra, you know where to find it.
Judy, Judy, relax, this is our little harmonica we're talking about. We taught her well. Ten percent of your paycheck, where does it go?
In the bank.
Anything larger back there?
I can't believe it.
No, it's not just that. It's justI want someone who... who does something for me, y'know? Who gets my heart pounding, who... who makes me, uh...
I don't know.
Is this still about her whole 'The Flintstones could've really happened' thing?
...little playthings with yarn?
What?
No! No! Not-I don't mean I-I see her as a twelve-year-old girl! I mean I-I have a son, who's umm six and I still think of him as a baby.
Yeah. You know what? I know what you mean; I do that too.
I beg your pardon?
You have a son?
Yeah, well my-my ex-wife and I share custody of Ben and umm, uh, and just so you know, Carol and I are on excellent terms as I'm sure you are with your wife! Oh, I'm sorry! It's unbelievable!
Yeah, well what about you? You weren't you know, so hot in college either. After everything he said, he'd go "ba dum bum chessh"
Look, we do not repel women OK? That is completely untrue.
Oh no, yes we do my man. Remember when we were back in college and we went to that spring dance and you walked right up to that girl you liked and you could not stop talking about the Irish potato famine?
Yeah, Monica doesn't like that either, Maybe I should stop doing that.
Oh y'know what, girls don't like it when I start talking about science.
Uh-oh, uh-oh, the laundry's done. It's, uh, it's a song. The laundry song that we sing. Uh-oh the laundry's done, uh-oh, uh-oh.
That does not sound stupid to me. You know, it's like the first time I had to make dinner for myself, after Carol left me? I'm sorry, that's all the time we have. Next on Ross... Uh-oh.
What uh-oh?
Ross, what's the matter?
Nothing, nothing. Lee-lo, the laundry's done.
Y'know what, 100 million people went to see a movie about what I do, I wonder how many people would go see a movie called, Jurassic Parka.
First of all it's Professor Pittain! And second of all, that little bone, proved that, that particular dinosaur had wings, but didn't fly.
Okay, see now, what I just heard, blah-blah-blah, blah-blah-blah-blah-blah, blah-blah-blah, blah, blah.
Oh, that is so...
No-no-no, a bunch of out of control jackets take over an island.
Hello. Hi sweetie. Good. Look umm, yes I've been thinking about that thing that you wanted me to do and, I can do it. So will you come to New York?
Thanks.
Ross? Look, whatever this relationship stuff that Emily wants, just give it to her. Come on, the bottom line here is that you love her. So just fix whatever she wants fixed. Just do it. I mean, you're gonna have to try. You'll just gonna hate yourself if you don't. Oh come on answer it! It's driving me crazy!
Never done that before.
Nope.
In fact, I'll bet you 50 bucks that you can't go the whole year without making fun of us. Eh, y'know what, better yet? A week.
Maybe your resolution is to not make fun of your friends, especially the ones who may soon be flying you to Europe for free on their own plane.
She has a better chance of sprouting wings and flying up your nose than you do of not making fun of us.
I'll take that bet my friend. And you know what, paying me the 50 bucks could be the "new thing you do that day!" And it starts right now!
All right, my New Year's resolution is to learn how to play the guitar.
Everyone thinks they know me. Everyone says 'Jack Geller, so predictable'. Maybe after I'm gone, they'll say 'Buried at sea! Huh!'.
C'mon, you'll make a day of it! You'll rent a boat, pack a lunch...
...And then we throw your body in the water... Gee, that does sound fun.
That's probably what they'll say.
I'd like that.
Yes! Yes! I mean it's-it's kinda far from work, but uh, y'know, I'll get so much done on the commute. I-I've been given the gift of time!
That's way uptown! That's like three trains away! Which is great! I love to ride that rail!
So you're really okay with this?
Now that's so funny, because last Christmas I got the gift of space. We should get them together and make a continuum.
Now he's movin'? Man, what is Emily doing to him? Ow!! He's not even here!!!
Am I! Am I! Am I out of my mind! Am I losing my senses!! This dreamy guy is taking my girlfriend out for a meal.
'Why don't you call him?!' Well, thank you very much! Y'know now he is going to prep her, y'know prep her, as in what you do when you surgically remove the boyfriend!
Are you crazy?!
What?! Ross y'know this isn't even about you! I mean this is about Rachel and something wonderful happening for her. I mean you know even if you're right, what if he wants to sleep with her, does it mean he gets too?
No.
Well, I can't say any of us were surprised. Your parents have been unhappy ever since we've known them. Especially after that incident in Hawaii.
Oh, we were so sorry to hear about your parents splitting up, dear.
Oh, well, you know, they're just separated so, you know, never know, we'll see.
What, what incident?
Uhh, naa, no no no, I, I must be thinking of someone else, uh, maybe me. Don't you have some folding to do? Go fold dear. Fold. You fold.
Well I'm sorry but you were! Okay? And besides if anyone should be hitting on her it's the guy who's single, the guy that who-who-who can do something about it.
Chandler was hitting on the hot delivery girl!
I was not and oh God, shh!
Sounds like somebody wants to be Mr. Pizza Delivery Girl.
Well...
Y'know what? I think I can take care of myself, I'll talk to you later. Good-bye. Whoa! Uh, that was your sister actually. She-she thinks that you're just using me.
So that's the only reason she could be here huh? It couldn't have anything to do with the fact that-that maybe I'm a good listener and I uh I put on a great slide show!
Ross, I am telling you that she is using you to get back at me!
So?
Hey!
Gosh, we talked about that but your brother has so many science trophies and plaques and merit badges, well we didn't want to disturb them.
Well sweetie, we have a surprise for you. We're turning your room into a gym.
Wow, that is a surprise. Just one little question, uh, why not Ross's room?
Oh, God forbid.
Oh, hi Rachel.
Oh shoot, tomorrow's not so good, I'm supposed to um, fall off the Empire State building and land on a bicycle with no seat. Sorry.
We?
Are ah, having dinner with my Dad tomorrow night, I hope that's okay.
Ross, my father doesn't hate you.
Please, he refers to me as 'wethead'.
I know, I know I was, but there was always this little voice inside that kept saying it's never gonna happen, move on. You know whose voice that was?
Then, no.
So what the hell happened to you in China? I mean, when last we left you, you were totally in love with, you know.
God?
It was you, pal.
This is perfect! She'll have to come back here with your pizza, and when she does, I'll turn on the Charm-O-Ross. Oh I'm so glad you don't eat meat.
Okay, y'know what? We don't need her measurements.
Okay pepperoni, pepperoni, pepperoni, okay Ross, I know she's pretty and you love her, but is she stupid?! She forgot my vegetarian!
See? Vegetarianism benefits everyone.
Hey everybody, look who's here! You remember my grandmother!
Look at it this way: you dumped her. Right? I mean, this woman was unbelievably sexy, and beautiful, intelligent, unattainable... Tell me why you did this again?
Well, call me if you change your mind.
Sorry, the first guy runs the lips.
Hey!
Hey, waitwait, aren't you the guy that plays the butt in the new Al Pacino movie?
Oh Donald that-that would be great. I am totally ready to come back to work. I-What? No! Wh... What are you doing?!! GET OFF MY SISTER!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Well I am that. And that whole rage thing is definitely behind me.
I wonder if its time for you to rejoin our team at the museum?
Chandler!!! Chandler!!! Chandler, I saw what you were doing through the window! Chandler, I saw what you were doing to my sister! Now get out here!
Wow! Listen, we had a good run. What was it? Four? Five months? I mean, that's more than most people have in a lifetime! So, good-bye, take care, bye-bye then!
Too easy? Too...The process of every living thing on this planet evolving over millions of years from single-celled organisms, too easy?
You don't believe in evolution?
I don't know, it's just, you know...monkeys, Darwin, you know, it's a, it's a nice story, I just think it's a little too easy.
Yeah, I just don't buy it.
Uh, excuse me. Evolution is not for you to buy, Phoebe. Evolution is scientific fact, like, like, like the air we breathe, like gravity.
Well, apparently not, and I can't just stand by and watch two people I care about very much be hurt over something that is so silly. I mean, enough of the silliness!
What's all this about you guys fighting?! Is this really over a room?! I mean, that is so silly!
Ross, we can handle this.
Well, why don't you tell her to stop being silly!
Okay-okay! Two very good points, look I've known you both a long time, and I've never seen either of you one/millionth as happy as you've been since you've got together. Do you really want to throw that all away over a room? That is so silly. Now wh-what is more important, love or silliness?
Ohh! Okay! Okay. "There are three primary theories concerning sediment flow rate. Each of these theories can be further subcategorized into..."
No! Why?
Well, I've just never seen a guy stare so hard at a piece of paper that didn't have naked chicks on it.
Why don't you open with a joke?
Open with a joke? It's a university, not a comedy club!
Oh! ...Yeah, they were gross. Oh, you know what I loved? Her Sweet 'n' Los. How she was always stealing them from- from restaurants.
Oh God!
The fuzzy little mints at the bottom of her purse.
Not just restaurants, from our house.
Mrs. Geller?
'S'funny, um, uh, we agreed we'd spend the rest of our lives together. Things change, roll with the punches. I believe Julia's on the table..?
Julia..
We agreed on Minnie.
Sorry about that. So. What have you been up to?
Oh, not much. I-I got a job.
Okay, okay, we'll just get everyone to act like they like it. That-that way noone makes fun of her and we still get to go to Sweet Potatoe Pie!
What?! What is with everybody? It's Thanksgiving, not...Truth-Day!
Look, when everyone eats that...that...Banana-Meat thing, they're all gonna' make fun of her, do you want that?
Dude, they're not objects.
Just kiddin,' I'll talk to them, you distract Rach.
Rachel, I've seen you naked a million times. I ate hot fudge off you naked. Remember, I-I sucked that mini-marshmallow out of your belly button?
What?
I don't want you to see me naked!
Yeah, but that was different. Y'know? I mean, we were, we were going out then, now I think it's weird.
Rach, y'know I can see you naked any time I want.
No no no, I mean, hey, why shouldn't I be happy for you? What would it say about me if I couldn't revel in your joy? I'm revelling baby, believe me!
Why wouldn't I want to come? I had fun at the first wedding.
Look I just thought that...
Is your finger caught in that chair?
Mmm hmmm.
I just wanted to tell you something before you heard it from someone else and I hope this isn't too weird, but uh, I had uh, a thing with Janice. What you're-you're not mad?
Dude, we got to talk.
Okay.
Why would I be mad?
Well, because y'know there are certain rules about this kind of stuff. You don't uh, you don't fool around with your uh, friend's ex-girlfriends or possible girlfriends or girls they're related to.
No-no-no, that's great! I'll be there Monday. And thank you again! Okay. Umm, that was the head of the Paleontology department at N uh, Y, uh U!
Yeah.
That you're a liar.
Wow! Uh what, did he uh, say?
Well remember that paper I had published last year on sediment flow rate, huh? They loved it.
Hey, you're a doctor of gums. That's the smallest body part you can major in. It's like day one, floss. Day two, here's your diploma.
Of... of what?
You're jealous because I'm a real doctor.
Hey, you listen.
No, no, let me finish.
Judy, Judy, relax, this is our little harmonica we're talking about. We taught her well. Ten percent of your paycheck, where does it go?
Because they made me.
You were fired? What're you gonna do?
In the bank.
There you go. So she dips into her savings, that's what it's there for. She's gonna be fine, and if you need a little extra, you know where to find it.
Wow! The only thing I got from my Grandmother was her eyes. I mean not-not her actual eyeballs, but, but people say that my eyes-Do-do you want to make out?
This place is really beautiful!
Yeah, I've been coming here since I was a kid. This used to be my Grandma's.
Sure!
Are you okay? What's wrong?
Unagi is a state of total awareness. Okay? Only by achieving true unagi can you be prepared for any danger that may befall you!
Y'know what? Fine! Get attacked! I don't even care!
Come on Ross. We're sorry. Please tell us what it is.
You mean in case someone is trying to steal your bamboo sleeping mat or your kettle of fish?
All I'm saying is, it's one thing being prepared for an attack against like each other; whole another story being prepared for an attack, I don't know, like a surprise!!
Th-th-that's all it is, a third nipple. Y'know? Just your run-of-the-mill third nipple. Y'know? You can take it off. Just slice that baby right off!
W-w-w-wait! Why?!
Well look, if I wanted to see a fireman, I would date one. Okay?
Take your shirt off, and let's see what we're dealing with here. What are you doing?
Just showing you my run-of-the-mill-slice-it-right-off third nipple.
Woah, woah, woah australopithicus isn't supposed to be in that display. No. No. No, n, homo-habilus was erect, australopithicus was never fully erect.
Oh you are so lucky.
I know.
Well maybe he was nervous.
Oh look, I can't believe this. Look, homo-habilus hasn't even learned how to use tools yet and they've got him here wi, with clay pots. Why don't, why don't they just give him a microwave? I'm sorry, I'm sorry this is taking so long, ya know, I, I, it's just it's longer than I expected, we will have dinner.
Look, okay-okay I had food poisoning! It's not like I choose to do it! It's not like-It's not like I said, "Umm, what would make this ride more fun?!"
You told her!
Nancy Thompson's getting fired!
You're right. I mean I'm sorry. Yeah, I shouldn't be laughing. I should be laying down papers for you!
How could you tell her?!
My doctoral dissertation is in the library at school, I went to see it, and there were students makin' babies right in the middle of the Paleontology section!
People are doing it in front of my book!
I'm sorry?
Oh my God! Did you get to see anything good?
Let me ask you something, at your school was there a like uh a place on campus where students went to uh, fool around.
No, I'm getting back down 'cause she lives in Poughkeepsie. She seems really great, but she's like totally great, but she lives two and a half hours away.
Okay, it was just me and her at the back of the train, and I sat near the door, so she'd have to pass by me if she wanted to switch cars. She was totally at my mercy.
Were you so late because you were burring this woman?
How can she be great if she's from Poughkeepsie? That joke would've killed in Albany.
Done! I did it! Heh, who's stupid now?
No, hey, I get that, okay, I get that big time. And I'm happy for ya, but I'm tired of having a relationship with your answering machine! Okay, I don't know what to do anymore.
Yes.
Ross do you realise this is the first time in my life I'm doing something I actually care about. This is the first time in my life I'm doing something that I'm actually good at. I mean. if you don't get that...
Well neither do I!
Is this about Mark?
Ahh, oh that's OK, I mean, he's probably got, you know, parties to go to and stuff. But, ya know, he's moved on. Hey, that, that's the way it goes right.
What happened?
One of the virus victims called in sick, so Cathy recommended me and boom, I'm dying on the gurney. Oh Ross, Marcel just finished his last scene if you want to go down there and say goodbye.
Oh my God.
What?
Okay, this is getting a little crazy. I mean, I'm-I'm sure it would be amazing but I...gotta say I really-really don't think it would be a good idea. Y'know? I really, really...don't.
Yeah-yeah, we never had that,
No.
'Sup? 'Sup dude?
Take whatever you want, just please don't hurt me.
Hmm -you know, actually this'll work out well. Cause when you have to move back in with Joey, Joey's hot new roommate can come and live with me.
Whoa, hello, did you just meet Monica?
She is gonna recognize that I did a nice thing and-and, appreciate it.
I see, I see, y-y-you're trying to freak me out.
Look Chandler, Monica is really weird about this kind stuff all right. Believe me, I lived with her for 16 years. She is going to freak...out. Oh my God, she's going to sit on you.
Oh uh, I had trouble remembering everyone's name, so I-I kinda came up with nicknames. Like the guy on the other side of you was Smelly von Brownshirt.
What? Of course I did! You uh, you sat next to Sleepy Sleeperson.
Who?
Oh yeah. So umm, did you have a nickname for me?
Umm, no. No.
Ok, ok, here we go. Ok, where am I talking to, here? I mean, uh, well, there is one way that seems to offer a certain acoustical advantage, but...
Ok.
Anytime you're ready.
Just aim for the bump.
Ok, ok, ok, ok, here goes. You know, I, you know, can't do this. Uh, this is too weird. I feel stupid.
You don't understand! Elizabeth was about to ask me to go on a trip with her! Is that taking it slow?! No, I'm not ready for this! Okay? What-what do I tell her?
Professor Geller!
Yes, professor Feesen-sen-stenlger... I'll be with you in one moment. So, I will take one box of the Thin Mints.
Just tell her the truth! Tell her you're not ready.
I can do that. Oh-oh, what if she gets upset?
Hey, they're going to the gym together! Two women! Stretching! Y'know they-they take a steam together! Things get a little playful-didn't you see Personal Best?
Look, this is just a little too familiar, okay? For like, for Like six months before Carol and I spilt up, all I heard was "My friend Susan is so smart. My friend Susan is so funny. My friend Susan is so great."
You actually think that something can happen between Emily and Susan?
No, but I'm gonna!
Hi! Hi! You're crazy! Okay? This is Emily. Emily is straight.
No. No, it's just 'cause, uh, I kinda wanted to go out with her too, so I told her, actually, you were seeing Bernie Spellman... who also liked her, so...
Nono, me neither. Although, uh, y'know, back in college, Susan Sallidor did.
You're kidding! Did you tell her I wasn't?
Well, this is fascinating. So, uh, what is it about me?
I dunno, 'cause you're smart, you're funny...
Are you kidding? Okay, look. I-I studied evolution. Remember, evolution? Monkey into man? Plus, I'm a doctor, and I had a monkey. I'm Doctor Monkey!
Continue.
So Steve said he had to go to the doctor. And Steve's doctor's name is Doctor Muppy. So I said, 'Doctor Monkey?' And that is how the whole Doctor Monkey thing came up.
I'm not arguing with that.
All right, I've heard enough. I've made my decision.
It was ridiculous. Ya know, these guys, they were bullies, actual bullies, ya know. We're grown ups, this kinda stuff isn't supposed to happen anymore.
Noo.
You're kiddin'.
Oohhh.
Hi.
You know what, this is ridiculous, ok. This is your birthday, this is your party. I say we just put 'em all together and if they can't deal with it, who cares.
Well, we could count again.
I can't believe this is happening.
I do.
That's who.
Alright, alright. We're all adults here, there's only one way to resolve this. Since you saw her boobies, I think, uh, you're gonna have to show her your peepee.
What? What?
Did you not get a good enough look the other day?
Y'know, I don't see that happening?
C'mon, he's right. Tit for tat.
I knew it! I knew it! I always knew she liked him! Y'know, she'd say no, but here we are! Right? We just broke up, first thing she does!
Is there any chance you didn't see that?
Ross! You gotta stop! Okay?! You can't just stare through the peep hole for three hours! You're gonna get peep eye!
You didn't just break up.
Hey, it's been like three weeks!
Hey listen can you do me a big favor? The dean's office just called and said there was an urgent meeting. Can you watch Ben for like an hour?
Don't talk to me now!
Awww, just like his daddy.
What-what about Monica?
Oh, she isn't home.
Okay, so it wasn't uh, a traditional massage. But I did give him accu-pressure with a pair of chopsticks. And, and I gently exfoliated him with, with a mop.
I gave him an extremely professional massage!
He said you poked at him with wooden spoons.
Well, he's never coming back! Okay? You just cost me eight dollars a week!
Hey, y'know what? This is your fault! You're the one that didn't move his-his appointment.
Huh? Oh-oh, it was fine. Uh, it was just a misunderstanding. She didn't want me to go with her. She just wanted to let me know that she's going to Florida for spring vacation.
Hey!
Hey! How did it go with Elizabeth?
Wait a minute, is she going for spring vacation or is she going for spring break?
What's-what's the difference?
Okay! Okay! Fine, I'll stop! No teaching, okay? We'll just watch the pretty light streaking across the sky. Okay? Who's official name is Bapstein-King.
Well, technically it seven billion years ago...
Oh no! Oh no!
Okay! Okay!
There it is! Oh, look at that! Isn't Mother Nature amazing?
Lady, he is people. He has a name, okay? He watches Jeopardy! He he touches himself when nobody's watching. Please, please have a heart!
Oh.
Excuse me... This hospital is for people!
I'll take a look at him.
Oh, thank you.
Oh my God! Of course, of course. Umm, would you please excuse me for a moment? Umm, do you know each other's hometowns? Why don't you... Wh-what's going on?
Phoebe, oh my God! Wh-wh-what are you doing here?
I need to talk to you, it's pretty urgent. It's about Monica and Chandler.
Well, umm, not much. But, I was just thinking that since those guys just got engaged that maybe it would be nice if they had some privacy, y'know? So, could I just move in with you for a couple days?
Umm, okay, yeah, sure. But wh-what's wrong with Monica and Chandler?
No, y'know what, I guess it's partially my fault. Y'know, I shouldn't've, uh, asked you to start off with a monkey. I should've started you off with like a pen or a pencil.
I- I- I ca- I can't believe this. I mean, all I asked you to do was keep him in the apartment.
I know, I know, I'm sorry-
Ross, I'm doing everything that I can, I've got everybody looking for him, and I- Oh! Who is it?
Animal Control.
Oh-oh, you're-you're fellow scholars. What exactly were you looking for, hmm? Perhaps, perhaps Dr. Chester Stock's musings on the Smiledon Californicus?
Yes? Yes?! How can I help you?
Yeah, we were...we were just looking around.
Uhh....
Ah... Ah...Get out of here! Uh, meeting someone? Or-or are you just here to brush up on Marion's views on evolution?
It's okay if he bumps his head, kids bump their heads all the time, y'know, it was your first time babysitting, I figured you did the best you could.
Well, he's finally alseep. About that ah, bump on his head?
Are you, are you, are you sure it's ah, a new bump? I mean, no offense, I've always thought of Ben as a fairly bumpy headed child.
I did!
I know! I'm saying you have to watch them all the time.
Actually that-that's not true, in The Incredible Hulk uh, No. 72, Dr. Bruce Banner found... Y'know, ugh, nevermind, my girlfriend's a lesbian.
Oh. What's wrong with Ross?
Well, it's just y'know that something like this would never to like The Hulk, y'know...
So, I decided I'm definitely going to go with either Joey or Chandler.
Oh! Oh-oh, you gotta pick Joey! I mean, name one famous person named Chandler.
How 'bout instead you, go get changed! You, give him back his underwear! I'm gonna go get a cab, and I want everyone down stairs in two minutes! Monica!
You were gonna drink the fat.
Let's see what else he'll do!
Stop it. Stop it!
Ross, went to get a cab so we can all... No, wh-what are you doing! No, Monica, no!
Yeah, she's got to go back to London. But you know what? I've been prepared for this from the start. We both knew we had two weeks together, and that's it. Y'know.
Oh yeah, she's-she's amazing. And-and she's so much fun. And! Y'know what? When I'm with her, I'm fun! I even signed up for helicopter classes. She's leaving in two days, I don't have to do it.
Oh no, two days, you must be bummed.
Hey that's what all my relationships are like.
Yes, but in Ross's case, they both know in two weeks that's it.
Oh come on. It's cold, it's dark, he doesn't know the Village. And now I have a broken foot. I have no monkey, and a broken foot! Thank you very much.
Marc- oh, this is ridiculous! We've been all over the neighbourhood. He's gone, he's-he's just gone.
Ross, you don't know that.
Ross, I said I'm sorry like a million times. What do you want me to do? You want me to break my foot too? Okay, I'm gonna break my foot, right here. Ow!! Oh! Oh my God, oh my God! There, are you happy now?!
Yeah, yeah. Y'know, now that you kicked the sign, hey! I don't miss Marcel any more!
Yeah! Anyway, I-I still think we should try to patch things up, y'know? Like uh, maybe we could get him to get tickets to another Knicks game and invite him.
Okay. Well, apparently Chandler's angry at us for not getting him a ticket to that Knicks game a couple of weeks ago.
Oh, we're supposed to just get him a ticket?! That guy is always mooching off of us!
Oh wow that's a great idea! And I still have his credit card.
Here you go.
See, Rach, uh, see, I don't think that swearing off guys altogether is the answer. I really don't. I think that what you need is to develop a more sophisticated screening process.
...medium...hmm...any cookies left?
Yep!
No. I just need to be by myself for a while, you know? I just got to figure out what I want
Uh, no, no, see, because not...not all guys are going to be a Paolo.
No, no, no, no, no, I don't want to know, absolutely not. I think, you know, I think you should know until you look down there, and say, oop, there it is! Or isn't...
Oh, you know the sex of the baby? Oh, oh-oh-oh!
Do you want to know?
Oh, hello Ross!
Susan...
Okay, okay, so we're in the car. Right? And bang! A shot was fired. And Joey with no regard for his own safety throws himself on me!
Hi!
Okay, go ahead.
My God, Joey!
It was a car backfire!
Okay, there's this guy, Warren, from the museum and he's going on a dig for like two years and he's got this great place he needs to sublet. So uh, you interested?
Rach, uh, you still looking for a place?
Yeah! Why?
That sounds great! I'd love to live at Warren's!! I love Warren! Thank you!
Don't thank me! If you wanna thank something, thank the volcano that erupted thousands of years ago, killing but perfectly preserving an entire civilization. Here's Warren's number.
It came in the mail today, it's uh, 72 long-stemmed red roses, one for each day that I've known and loved Emily, cut up into mulch!
She's doing her laundry.
What's that?
Oh, honey that's awful.
Oh, it's not so bad. Monica's gonna make potpourri! I think I'm gonna go wander out in the rain for a while.
Well let there-what if a man comes along and puts a gun to your head and says, "You ride this bike or I'll sh...I'll shoot you."
Well...In-in case of emergency.
What kind of an emergency?
Okay, I would ring the bell to distract him and then I would knock the gun out of his hand with a Chinese throwing star.
Okay, Phoebe just-just get-get on the bike and-Hey! I'll hold you up and-and push you. Okay?
Well, then, I think, I think the guy is scum. I hate him. I mean I actuallyI-I physically hate him. I always have. You are way too good to be with a guy like that.
Ok. Well, before I say anything, I just need to know, is this one of those things where you break up with a guy, and then I tell you what I think, and then the next day you get back together with the guy, and I look like a complete idiot?
No. No-no-no-no.
Really?
You deserve to be with someone who appreciates you, and who gets how funny and sweet and amazing, and adorable, and sexy you are, you know? Someone who wakes up every morning thinking "Oh my god, I'm with Rachel". You know, someone who makes you feel good, the way I am with Julie. Was there a second of all?
And-and I, and I saw that Joey was about to go in, so I ran in ahead of him to-to surprise him and, and then I pretended I didn't know he was in there.
That's Phoebe! Where did you get that?
Well down at the adult video place down on Bleaker.
Wow! I mean, I just-I can't, I can't believe this. Y'know, I mean you think you know someone even, even Phoebe who's always been somewhat of a question mark.
This is so bizarre. I guess it kinda makes sense though, y'know she had such a terrible childhood.
No, no, she's great and it's not like we haven't done anything. I mean, uh, uh, we, we do plenty of other stuff, lot's of other stuff, like uhh. . .
Technically, huh, no.
Wow. Is it, is it 'cause she's so cold in bed. Or, or is it 'cause she's like, kinda bossy, makes it feel like school?
No, no no no, don't need to know the details.
It's just, it's, it's me. You, you know I've only been with one woman my whole life and she turned out to be a lesbian. So now I've got myself all psyched out, you know, and it's become, like this, this thing and I. . . Well, you just must think I'm weird.
Well, if what's in the bottle is actually 30. I mean sometimes you get 30, sometimes it's-it's get 4, and I swear to God more often than not it's just milk.
It was pretty funny when I, when I hid it for a while, huh? Anyway, umm, I-I am worried about that bathing suit, not because it's revealing which I'm fine with, no I'm concerned about your health, sun exposure.
Oh, don't worry I have plenty of sun block, it's SPF-30.
Ross, it's going to be okay. I'm not going down there to hook up with a bunch of guys. I really like you. I like how things are going between us.
Really?
Wow! I have never had such a healthy break-up! She was such a grown-up about it! She didn't seem too immature for me! Did I just make a huge mistake?
Hey! Oh my God you're here, let me see your hand!!
No, you're too late!!! She already took out the trash!!!
Ross! Wait!
Elizabeth, thank God! I was just thinking about...
I don't know, I don't think mom and dad would mind. Remember when you were 9 and Richard was 30, how dad used to say, 'God I hope they get together.'
No, I think you should tell them.
No, I don't even know how serious he is about me. Until I do, I'm not telling them anything.
Alright, shall we?
OK, wait, wait, wait, wait. You know what? Ross, let's - let's switch places. You get in the middle. No un-, ya know, unless this looks like we're trying to cover something up.
No wait! Look, wait! Okay, you can hang up, but I'm gonna keep calling! I'm gonna, I'm gonna call everyone in England if that's what it takes to get you to talk to me!
Emily? Emily! Oh my God! Oh my God, it's Emily! It's Emily everyone! Shush-shush-shhst! Hi!
Ross, I'm only ringing to say stop harassing my relatives. Good-bye!
Really? About what?
Look you're my wife. We're-we're married. Y'know? I-I love you. I-I really miss you.
Let-let me make sure I'm hearing this right, you're ending this with me because I'm too whiney? So you're saying, I've become so whiney that I annoy you, Janice.
Huh?
You're a very sweet person Ross, umm, unfortunately I don't think I can take another second of you whining!!
Well yeah!!
OH...MY...GOD!!
Yes. Yes. Yes! Yes, I really do! In fact, it's funny, very often, someone who you wouldn't think could-could curl your toes, might just be the one who...
Wait-wait. I, I got it. I was there.
Well, I mean, do you think you can ever have both? Y'know? Someone who's like, who's like your best friend, but then also can make your toes curl?
Hi.
...Gets interrupted. Hi!
Oh, it looks like mom and dad's house. Oh, it even has a tree with a broken limb out front and the uh, the window in the attic is...Oh my God!!
Yeah?
Look at this.
What? What happened to the window in the attic?!
I can't believe mom and dad are selling the house!
Now that is funny. Hey, do you think...would it be too weird if I invited Carol over to join us? 'Cause she's, she's alone now, and pregnant, and, and sad.
Oh no. I thought you said they could shoot the spot without you.
I thought they could...I'll try to get back as soon as I can. I'm sorry.
I guess.
Are you sure? Great. Carol? Wanna come over and join us?
It's like that everywhere, Joey! Okay, Mon, back me up here. Where you work the uh, waiters eat with the waiters, right? And the chefs eat with the other chefs, right?
But hey, it's not just me, I mean the scientists and the tour guides never sit together.
Whatever.
I eat by myself in the alley because everybody hates me.
Look, Ross, really it's-it's no big deal. Y'know you wear a white coat, I wear a blue blazer, if that means we can't be friends at work, then so be it. Y'know, hey I understand. Y'know? Hey, when I'm in a play and you're in the audience, I don't talk to you, right? So it's y'know, it's uh, it's cool. I'll see you tomorrow.
Hi, we're visitiing. It's Ben and his da-da. Da-da. Can you say da-da? Look, I'm gonna tell your momies you said it anyway so you might as well try.
With that moustache doesn't Chandler remind you of Aunt Sylvia?
Thank you.
No luck huh?
Naa. A while ago I got a sah out of him, which I thought, ya know, might turn into sah-condary caregiver but... Hey, would you uh, would you hold him for a sec, 'cause I, I gotta take this off.
Aw, y'know...Y'know, maybe we're-we're just approaching this all wrong. If you're Chandler and-and you wanna hide, where is the last place on Earth people would think you'd go?
That is an old, Chinese woman!
He could be in disguise, y'know.
So this is your office?
How did you guys find me? I knew I should've hid at the gym!
Well, oh just ah, I was just wondering, when you and I split up, did you get the tape that was half the last episode of M*A*S*H and half the hostages coming home?
Hey.
Hey, what are you doing here?
Ah yeah, but now it's Susan and me in Mexico and the hostages coming home.
Where's Ben?
No Joey! Look why don't, why don't we just let her decide? Okay? Hey-hey, we'll each go out with her one more time. And-and we'll see who she likes best.
Okay, okay. This can go on for a while.
Yeah well we should order some food then.
That sounds fair.
Maybe I'll take her to that new French restaurant down the street...
This is crazy! I mean, yes-yes Rachel is my good friend and I-I have loved her in the past, but now, she is just my wife! Phoebe, will you-will you help me out here?
What?!
She said, "He's obviously still in love with this Rachel girl."
Well, I thought you loved her when you-when you married her.
We were drunk! I would've married uh, Joey with that amount of alcohol!
Yeah, Joan Tedeski my date. She's an assistant professor in the Linguistics department. Tall, very beautiful, and despite what some people say, not broad backed!
Oh what's the big deal?! I wasn't even invited to the ceremony, just the reception. And-and y'know what? If it makes you feel any better, Joan and I will just make an appearance and then, and then we'll-we'll leave early as a sign of protest.
Joan?
Wait a minute, you got Ross Gellar and guest?! I wasn't invited and you got "and guest?!"
Uh-uh, excuse me, I do have to interrupt on Ross's behalf. I-I think the rule applies here y'know, since she has a chance to get on broad back...
Thank you, Dr. Phillips, but I'm having my lunch at this table, here in the middle. I'm having lunch right here, with my good friend Joey, if he'll sit with me.
All right. Umm, you could uh start out with a little 1, a 2, a 1-2-3, 3, 5, a 4, a 3-2, 2, a 2-4-6, 2-4-6, 4, 2, 2, 4-7, 5-7, 6-7, 7, ...7.....7...7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7...!
Dr. Geller, there's a seat over here.
I will sit with you Dr. Geller.
Y'know, we work in a museum of natural history, and yet there is something unnatural about the way we eat lunch. Now, I look around this cafeteria, and y'know what I see, I see-I see division. Division, between people in white coats and people in blue blazers, and I ask myself, "My God why?!" Now, I say we shed these-these coats that separate us, and we get to know the people underneath. I'm Ross! I'm divorced, and I have a kid!
Wow, well uh, uh, actually, Julie's downstairs getting a cab, I just need the cat toy, did Monica say. . . What? Why, why are you looking at me like that?
Oh. And how was the date?
Umm, I think there was a restaurant... I know there was wine. . .
I don't know, I, I feel like I had a dream about you last night but I, I don't remember.
OK. Oh, oh, oh.
Ohh, God, nobody likes him, and he's so cheap, he'd never fly to London in a million years. Yeah, invite him? Hey, did I do these neat enough?
Yeah we are!
So what did he decide? Does your Uncle Nathan get an invite or not?
Yeah, they're fine.
Yeah?
It's hard to tell because I'm sweating, but I use exactly what the gel bottle says, an amount about the size of a pea. How, how can that be too much?
OK, here I go. . . here I go. . . I'm goin'.
Hi, welcome to our tropical Christmas party. You can put your coats and sweaters and pants and shirts in the bedroom.
Ice, ice, ice squares anyone? Take a napkin. Alright.
Monica, Monica, your guest are turning into jerky, OK.
Ok, well, if you do take him out for his walk, you might wanna bring his hat, and there's extra milk in the fridge, and there's extra diapers in the bag.
What? I have seven Catholic sisters. I've taken care of hundreds of kids. Come on, we wanna do it, don't we?
I was looking forward to playing basketball, but I guess that's out the window.
Hat, milk, got it.
??? Thro up a thro thro--a thro thro!
Yeah! I opened up to her about all the terrible stuff that's been happening to me. I mean I talked for hours. It is amazing to have someone give you such-such focused attention.
What?!
Are you serious?!
You don't need Janice for that, you've got us. We...
And the duck gets the Nutter-Butter!
Well, fine. Fine! If-if I'm the only person with any appreciation of the sanctity of the written word, I'll go up there and defend it myself! And don't you follow me!
Hi, I was wondering if it is possible to increase security in the Paleontology section? See I-I wrote a book up there and instead of reading it people are-are-are well, rolling around in front of it.
We are aware of the problem you are referring too. But as far as increasing security, I'm afraid the library is very understaffed. I, I can't help you.
Hey.
Hey!
Carol was wearing boots just like those the night that we- we first- y'know. Fact, she, uh- she never took'em off, 'cause we-we- Sorry. Sorry.
Leetch spots Messier in the crease- there's the pass!
We'll take a brief time out while Messier stops to look at some women's shoes.
What?
Peach pit.
Y'know what, y'know what, I'm-I'm not the one that wanted that, that break, okay. You're the one that bailed on us. You're the one that, that ran when things got just a little rough!
Hey. It's three in the morning. They don't know that I've come home yet. You notice how neither one of them are wondering where I am.
Yeah, y'know, people can be so self-involved.
That's....
That's what?!
So that's the only reason she could be here huh? It couldn't have anything to do with the fact that-that maybe I'm a good listener and I uh I put on a great slide show!
O-okay, Rach calm-calm down, okay? She-she's really upset we're just talking.
Ross! I think she is trying to make something happen with you to get back at me!
Ross, I am telling you that she is using you to get back at me!
Y'know what? I think I can take care of myself, I'll talk to you later. Good-bye. Whoa! Uh, that was your sister actually. She-she thinks that you're just using me.
Well I, that's the thing, I don't know! I mean, whenever I brought it up with her she said, "This is so fantastic! Why do we have to talk about the future? Let's just enjoy..."
Nah.
Hey, cheer up! You're gonna see her again, right?
No-no-no, don't-don't do the accent. You've got to see her again.
And why do you care so much?
Cool! Dad! My report cards! Hey, check this out dad, Math, A. Science, A. History, A. Gym... Oooh, my rock polisher!
Wow! Great! Wait, dad who-who's cigarettes are these?
I don't know. They-they must be your mother's, but please, please don't ask her. I'll throw these away.
Oh look, look there's your old makeup kit!
It's a clown kit! Clown kit!
Okay! Umm, I uh, I'm your teacher. I'm sorry, you're-you're a student and I-and I like women. In spite of what may be written on the backs of some of these chairs.
Well that brings me in the loop a little.
You see, that's why I did so bad on this test. I'm having a hard time concentrating. When you're up there and you're teaching and your face gets all serious...you look so good. You wear that tight little turtleneck sweater...
Oh my God! That guy at the counter is totally checking you out!
Really? My God, he's really cute.
Smooth man. Yeah, you got some chilie on your neck. Well, I just want to say, thanks everyone, this-this was great. And hey! See you guys Monday morning. Thanks Joey.
Okay, okay, a little announcement, I just want everyone to know that the position of my best man is still open! And uh, so is the position of the bride.
Great!
Oh, hey, don't forget your shirt.
Oh, thanks!
Hey there little fella! Hey, uh-hey, why don't we get some shoes on ya, huh? Hey, why don't you show dad how you can put your shoes on, in your room! Yay!!
Carol our sex life is-it's just not working...
Dad!!
Yay!
Yay! Seriously, our sex life... I was thinking, maybe I don't know, we could try some-some new things. Y'know? For fun?
No. But... it only has to happen once. Look, you and I both know we are perfect for each other, right? I mean... so, the only question is... are you attracted to me?
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What makes you think we're gonna break up?
Well, have you been involved with someone where you haven't broken up?
I don't know... I mean, I've never looked at you that way before.
Well, start looking.
I'm, I'm sorry you didn't get to go to Spacecamp, and I'm hoping that maybe somehow, this may make up for it. Presenting Sarah Tuttle's Private Very Special Spacecamp!!
Um, excuse me, everyone. Ah, this is my last night working here, and I ah, just wanted say that I made some really good friends working here, and ah, it's just time to move on. Ah, and no offence to everybody who ah, still works here, you have no idea how good it feels to say that as of this moment I will never have to make coffee again.
Now Mr. Kaplan Sr. likes his coffee strong, so your gonna use two bags instead of one, see. Now pay attention, 'cause this part's tricky, see some people use filters just once.
Really Mr. Geller, you don't have to do this.
Oh come on! Here we go! Stand by for mission countdown!
Because it's a special hat. See he bought it 'cause he was feeling really down one day so he got the hat to cheer himself up, ya know. Now Chandler...
Ok, ok, you know what? I think you're very funny. Kudos on that hat joke. But, come on guy just, just give him back the hat.
Why should we?
Stop talking, stop talking now. Let me just get this straight. You're actually stealing my hat?
You got a problem with that?
Look, face it, my father is not going to pay for the build-in barbecue and believe me you can kiss you gazebo goodbye. Now I might be able to get you the new lawn.
Okay, you know what? I don't have it, but I can tell you exactly where it is on my night stand, and...okay. But you know what? I have my drivers license and I have a twenty.

Ahh, then you have to give us the lawn ornaments.
I go back there with lawn ornaments, he's going to laugh in my face.
That doesn't matter. She wanted to call Bob. Hey, for all we know, Bob is who she was meant to be with. You may be destroying two people's chance for happiness.
I'm tellin' you. You can't do this.
Oh, come on. I can never get a girl like that with conventional methods.
We don't know Bob, ok? We know me. We like me. Please let me be happy.
Go over there and tell that woman the truth.
All right. Y'know what? We don't have to go downstairs! We can bring Vegas up to us! All right, come on, come on, we'll play some blackjack. Here we go. 13.
But you haven't even heard the chorus!
Oh my God, I'm starting to look like my great aunt, Muriel.
Hit me!
Oohh, 23. Which is what we play to at this casino! You win 10 dollars!
All I'm saying is, it's one thing being prepared for an attack against like each other; whole another story being prepared for an attack, I don't know, like a surprise!!
Unagi is a state of total awareness. Okay? Only by achieving true unagi can you be prepared for any danger that may befall you!
You mean in case someone is trying to steal your bamboo sleeping mat or your kettle of fish?
All right, you know that one was coming, but that doesn't mean you have unagi.
Ooh! Y'know what? If we made reservations, we could have unagi in about a half-hour.
Wait hold on Tony, hold on. Hello. Hi, yeah no, she's right here. Um hold on. Hi Tony, can I call you back? That's uh, that's my sister's boyfriend.
Look, you wanna get off my back?
You wanna get out of my face?
Give me that.
OK.
Uhh, naa, no no no, I, I must be thinking of someone else, uh, maybe me. Don't you have some folding to do? Go fold dear. Fold. You fold.
Well, I can't say any of us were surprised. Your parents have been unhappy ever since we've known them. Especially after that incident in Hawaii.
What, what incident?
Do you want a refill?
No, I'm alright, thanks.
Oh God. We didn't get into Scranton. That was like our safety zoo. They take like dogs and cows. See? I don't know who this is harder on, me or him.
I thought that movie was so incredibly... boring. I mean, that thing at the end where the kid kills himself because he can't be in the play? What was that?! It's like, kid, wait a year, leave home, do some community theatre. I walked out of there and I thought, 'Now, that's two hours of my life that I'm never getting back.' And that thought scared me more than all the other crap I was afraid to do.
Wow. Then I would definitely not recommend Mrs. Doubtfire.
I'd say that chair's taking the brunt.
Marcel! Marcel! Marcel, no! Good boy. See, how can nobody want him?
Give daddy the Barbi! Ben, give, give me the Barbi. Okay, how 'bout, don't you want to play with the monster truck? No. Okay, oh, oh, how about a Dino-soilder?
This doesn't have anything to do with the fact that he is being raised by two women, does it?
You know what it's fine. If you're okay with the Barbi thing, so am I.
Ross, you are so pathetic. Why can't your son just play with his doll?
I gotta go to work. Has anybody seen my left boob?
Oh, and also, he's, he's walkin' kind of funny, his left leg is moving a lot faster than his right leg, and he's in there just sort of y'know...
Well, I was just playing with him, and y'know we were doing the alphabet song, which he used to be really good at, but suddenly he's leaving out 'e' and 'f.' It's like they just ah, I don't know, fell out of his head.
Really?!
Oh my God, I wrecked your baby!!
I hope it's still funny when you're in hell.
Alright, alright, you know how you say I never seize the day? Well, alright, even though he's your super, I'm seizing. Mr. Treeger, here is 50 bucks, merry Christmas.
No, I will not cave.
Yeah, I'm with Mon.
Oh wow, I didn't get you anything. Here's five back.
No no, no, that, that's your Christmas tip, alright. Oh, hey, do you think there's a chance you could fix that radiator now?
'Why don't you call him?!' Well, thank you very much! Y'know now he is going to prep her, y'know prep her, as in what you do when you surgically remove the boyfriend!
You go get 'em. What did I do to you? Did I hurt you in some way?
What?
Are you crazy?!
Am I! Am I! Am I out of my mind! Am I losing my senses!! This dreamy guy is taking my girlfriend out for a meal.
Well, I lost. Some little girl loaned her uniform to her nineteen year old sister, who went down to the U.S.S. Nimitz, and sold over 2,000 boxes.
Um, that is because my doctor says that I have a very serious.... nuget.... diffency.
Tell us what happened, Brown Bird Ross.
Hey! How'd the interview go?
Oh, I blew it. I wouldn't of even hired me.
Guess who's here. It's the toughest guy in toy land, Ben. 'A real American hero. I'm G.I. Joe!' Drop the Barbi, drop the Barbi.
I said, 'So I'm not gonna lose her?'
Oh.
G.I. Joe? Do you really think he's gonna fall for that?
G. I. Joe! Cool! Can I play?
I, I don't know, it's got all this stuff about wind and trees and there's some kind of sacred pool in it. I mean, I don't really get it but she's, she's pretty upset about it.
You're right, I don't have to apologize. Sorry. Damnit!
What is it?
See, this is why I don't date women who read. Uh-oh.
What, what's that?
All right I've been feeling incredibly guilty about this, because I wanna be a good friend, and dammit I am a good friend. So just, just shut up and close your eyes .
OH.....MY.....GAWD!!
OH.....MY.....GOD!!
Wow, you are a good friend, 'course the audition was this morning, and I didn't get it. But that was a hell of a kiss. Rachel is a very lucky girl.
I'm tellin' ya that girl totally winked at me.
Ohhh, hey! All right, listen, I-I have that TV thing in like two hours, and I need your help, okay? What do you think? This blue suit, or this brown one?
Hey!
Hey!
Well, the brown one brings out your eyes, but your butt looks great in the blue one.
Really?
Okay, is everybody clear? We're gonna pick it up...and move it. Now all we need is teamwork, okay? We're gonna lift the car...and slide it out. Lift and slide!
Oh, and plus I'm 1/16th Portuguese.
Oh!
Ross, I really don't think...
Lift!! And slide!
Phoebe, she doesn't know that you sneak out every night, she doesn't know that you sneak back every morning, and she doesn't know that you've been living with your Grandmother's for a week now.
Hey, y'know while we're on that, when are you gonna tell my sister that you don't live here anymore.
I think on some levels she already knows.
Okay, well maybe not on those levels.
Hey.
Yeah, um, okay see, you were, you were on the list but my friend, Chandler brought up the very good point that you are international, so I bumped you for Wynona Rider, local.
Um, see, but that's not the final draft.
It's laminated!
Y'know it's ironic...
What?
My God! These pants are burning up! Oh come on, she wants to snuggle now! What is she trying to kill me? It's like a volcano in here! Are you hot?
No! To take more pictures of all of us together. I mean I really think it's the best resolution because everyone will enjoy the pictures.
Well, everyone will enjoy my music as well.
No.
Okay, it must just be me then.
Oh-oh-okay, but-but I know, that even though I've been a-a complete idiot up 'til now, I mean, I mean you-you-you have to come here. You have to come here so we can work this out.
Yeah, would you please consider moving here? I mean you were gonna move here anyway, why can't you just do that?
I don't know, it's just...
All right.
All right, did you just say all right?
Oh-oh-ooh, hey guys, I was wondering if you guys would uh, maybe chip in on some new air filters for the air purifier? I mean after all, we all are using it.
Okay!
There we go!
Let's go quicker.
Yeah!
So, this must be kinda neat for ya, huh? I mean, your Dad tells me that you get a couple of days off school, and you, you ah, don't have to sell those cookies anymore.
Gee, I always heard them talk about that, I just always thought that it was a club they went to. Oh God, I'm, I'm sorry.
It's all right. Sweetheart.
Well, I kinda wanted to sell the cookies. The girl who sells the most wins a trip to Spacecamp, and gets to sit in a real space shuttle.
Wow, you ah, you really like all this space stuff, huh?
Okay, look, we have nineteen minutes. Okay, Chandler, I want you to go and change! Okay. And then, when you come back, Joey will go change, and he'll have vacated the chair. Okay. Okay.
Me too. In fact, I think I might be a little too comfortable.
All right!
All right! Fine! I'm going. But when I get back it's chair sitting, and I'm the guy who's....sitting in a chair!
Is this a little too... Pheebs, what happened?
Oh I-, Oh wait, Tony can you hang on? That's the other line. Hello. Oh yeah she's here but uh, can she call you back? OK thanks. Call Joanna. Hi.
No, there is no way he was a velociraptor. No Tony, look at the cranial ridge, OK. If Dino was a velociraptor, he would have eaten the Flintstones. Yeah, yeah. Oh, were you takin' a nap?
I was.
Did she leave a number?
Did you see me write one down?
Yeah, but you were the one who got him back, y'know? You, you were great. ...Hey, we uh, we still have that, uh, that bottle of wine. You in the mood for, uh, something grape?
Listen, I'm- I'm sorry I was so hard on you before, it's just I...
Oh, Ross, c'mon. It's my fault, I almost lost your...
That'd be good.
Alright. The, uh, the neighbours must be vacuuming. Well, so long as we're here and, uh, not on the subject, I was thinking about, uh, how mad we got at each other before, and, um, I was thinking maybe it was partially because of how we, um...
Ohh, Geller's got one hooked! Ohh! Looks like a big one! Yeah, ohh! Ohh! It's the classic struggle between man and- Someone knocked over a lamp.
Hey umm, what's this?
Ohh, a hunk of sandwich from last year.
That's all right. Hey you guys, you know what's going to be great about the fishing trip this year? When my dad gets me out in the middle of the lake and gives me that, "Joey, what are you doing with your life?" stuff. I can say, "Well, I'm doing a movie with Charlton Heston dad. What are you doing with your life?"
Great!
I just have to go, all right? Do I need a reason? Huh? I mean I have things to do with my life, I have a jam packed schedule, and I am late- for keeping up with it. Okay?
It's, it's, it's, uh, a totally diferent situation! It's, it's apples and oranges, it's, it's orthodontists and lesbi- I gotta go.
Where are you going?
Hello? Hello?
Hello? Mindy! Hi! Hey, how are you? Yes, yes, I've heard, congratulations, that is so great. Really? Oh. Okay. Okay, well I'm working tomorrow, but if you want you can, you can, you can come by and... Okay... Great... Great... All right, so I'll, so I'll see you tomorrow! Okay.. Okay... Bye. Oh God. Oh God. Oh God.
Yeah, um, I don't know if you noticed, but he had a lot to drink, and you know how he gets when he's drun..uh... I can't do this, I did it, it was me, I'm sorry, I kissed your mom.
You're my friend. I-I had to tell you.
I can't believe it. Paolo kissed my mom?
What?
I was really upset about Rachel and Paolo, and I think I had too much tequila, and Nora- um, Mrs. Mom- your Bing- was just being nice, y'know, and- But nothing happened, nothing- Ask Joey, Joey, uh, came in-
Dad, dad, dad, I'm talkin' about the whole uh, baby thing. Did you uh, ever get this sort of... panicky, "Oh my god I'm gonna be a father" kind of a thing?
Dad, before I was born, did you freak out at all?
I'm not freaking out, I'm just saying, if somebody had come to me with the idea andndash;
No. Your mother really did the work. I was busy with the business. I wasn't around that much. Is that what this is about?
No, no, Dad, I was just wondering.
Umm, candles, champagne, yeah anniversaries are great. 'Cause you know love lasts forever, y'know. Nothing like it in this lifetime, money in the bank, so Rachel and I broke up.
Ah! Oh.
Sooo!! Anyway...
Oh God, Ross I am so sorry.
Yeah, well.
Ok, ok, sweetheart, I'll see you later. Ok, bye. What? Oh, that is so sweet. No, no, ok, you hang up. Ok, ok, one, two, three. Well you didn't hang up either.
Why don't you go see Frankie? My family's been goin' to him forever. He did my first suit when I was 15. No wait, 16. No, 'scuse me, 15. All right, when was 1990?
Okay. You have to stop the Q-tip when there's resistance!
She didn't hang up either!
Ok, no, no, you hang up. You, you, y...
No, no, with him. I'm on this field, and they, they hike me the baby... and I, I know I've gotta do something 'cause the Tampa Bay defence is comin' right at me.
I had a dream last night where I was playing football with my kid.
That's nice.
Tampa Bay's got a terrible team.
Right, but, it is just me and the baby, so I'm thinkin' they can take us. And so I uh, hah-hah, I just heave it down field.
Well, oh, I'm sorry your car broke down Pheebs, but I'm a little too busy with some of my real friends right now, but please call to let me know you got home safely okay?
Oh, now you want a favour?
Yes, please.
Phoebe, hang on a second. Here, take my car, go pick up your friends.
No, I'm not gonna pick them up.
No, it's not just 'cause I'm jealous. I mean I'm not, I'm not, I'm not jealous, okay? It's... Look, the guy, he screamed, he actually screamed at this couple sitting in our seats.
No! The guy is mean. I mean really mean. I think you should stay away from him.
Umm, or, maybe, I should stay away from all men.
Yeah, and at the end of the play, he, he got up y'know, and he just started like, banging his hands together!
Okay, fine, fine. You don't want to believe me? No, that's fine.
Look Chandler, Monica is really weird about this kind stuff all right. Believe me, I lived with her for 16 years. She is going to freak...out. Oh my God, she's going to sit on you.
Hmm -you know, actually this'll work out well. Cause when you have to move back in with Joey, Joey's hot new roommate can come and live with me.
I see, I see, y-y-you're trying to freak me out.
No, she's not okay? And I'll prove it to you. I'm gonna call her right now. Phone's done ehh.
Hi!
So I told Carl, 'Nobody, no matter how famous their parents are, nobody is allowed to climb on the dinosaur.' But of course this went in one ear and out.....
Um, Barry.
Awwww!!
I love how he cares so much about stuff. If I squint I can pretend he's Alan Alda.
Oh good, another dinosaur story. When are those gonna become extinct?
Yes. And another time after that. Boy I'm getting hungry! Hey Joey, have you ever been so hungry on a date that when a girl goes to the bathroom you eat some of her food?
Well umm...
You've been married twice?
You said the waiter ate my crab cake.
Yeah. So uh Ross, well now-why did that first marriage breakup? Was it because the woman was straight or she was a lesbian?
Ooh, I, I'm so sick of missing stuff. Ya know, I want him for more than, than a day, I want him for a whole weekend. No listen , I mean, I feel like-
I don't believe this. I miss, I miss the first time of everything. I missed, what, the first time he rolled over, the first time he crawled. What else did I miss? Has he spoken yet, is he driving, does he have a favorite liquour?
Actually, he is getting closer on the talking thing. He can't quite say mama yet, but once he said yumen.
Great. That would be fine.
Really? I mean, I, I had a whole speach prepared.
No! No, I won't! I'll be at the bottom of the dating barrel now. The only guys below me will be Four Divorce Guy uh, Murderer Guy, and-and, Geologists.
Could ya just, could ya just lay off, please? All right? My life is an embarrassment! I should go live under somebody's stairs!
Ross, it's not that big a deal! So you'll been divorced three times, you'll still have a life, you'll go on dates...
Ross, you're being ridiculous! Okay? You are cute and smart and sweet and that is much more important than three stupid divorces!
Oh yeah? Have you ever dated anyone who has been divorced three times?
Yeah, yeah, I was watching. Umm, hey, a couple of questions though. Umm, about that-that-that last move where the woman tripped you and then pinned you to the floor, what-what-what-what would you do next?
It's a great class.
Thanks.
Well, she would take her keys and try to jam them...
No. No-no. No. What would you do next?
Yeah-yeah, except Apollo 8 didn't actually land on the moon. But you-you-you could write that umm, your love lets me orbit the moon twice and return safely.
Y'know what? She'd-she'd love this. Uh, it's an exact replica of Apollo 8. I made it in the sixth grade.
Yeah, I guess I could use that. I could say that your love sends me to the moon.
Wait a minute, I can't give this to her.
Why not?
Oh. Listen, do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerability become any kind of a factor here-but do you think it would be okay if I asked you out? Sometime? Maybe?
You did! Oh.... I always figured you just thought I was Monica's geeky older brother.
I did.
Yeah, maybe...
Okay... okay, maybe I will...
I'm not proving anything. Okay, I'm done listening to you. If I hadn't let you talk me into going to the airport in the first place, I never would've put my fist through the wall!
Well...
Of course there's another guy!! This is even more perfect! Now you have to prove your love!
You put your fist through the wall?
No, I missed and hit the door. But, it opened really hard!
Monica's right, swing dancing can be tricky. I'm gonna use the phone. I gotta cancel those five giant teddy bears I sent to Emily. My God, think of the massacre.
What thing?
Well, Rachel wants to take swing dance lessons. Which I think is a really stupid idea! It's dangerous, she's never gonna get what she wants, and who knows who she might end up hurting.
I'm gonna do it.
All right, Rachel, I know-I know you think I'm crazy, please, before you tell him you love him, just-just try to find one person who thinks this is a good idea. Because I bet you, you can't.
I... I do, I do not love Rachel. I'm gonna tell her right now about the whole thing so we can get this marriage annulled as fast as possible. Okay? Would I do that if I loved her?
It's not that. Okay? Annulments are more complicated than I...
Yeah, complicated 'cause of the love.
I've never been more convinced of your love for her.
I do not have feelings for Rachel! Okay?!
Oh, hey, if I make you laugh, here's an idea, why don't you invite Paulo over and have a little romp in the sack and I'll just stand in the corner and tell knock-knock jokes.
Now I do.
Ross, Ross, please listen to me. Ross, you are so much better for me than Paolo ever was. I mean you care about me, you're loving, you make me laugh.
God, Ross, look, what you and I have is special, all Paolo and I ever had was...
Animal sex, animal sex? So what're you saying, I mean, you're saying that like, there's nothing between us animal at all. I mean there's not even like, uhm, a little animal, not even, not even like, like chipmunk sex?
Okay, it was just me and her at the back of the train, and I sat near the door, so she'd have to pass by me if she wanted to switch cars. She was totally at my mercy.
Oh, which museum?
No, answer his.
Were you so late because you were burring this woman?
No, I'm getting back down 'cause she lives in Poughkeepsie. She seems really great, but she's like totally great, but she lives two and a half hours away.
...now when they found the remains of the Mesozoic Mastodon they discovered what appeared to be the remains of a Paleozoic Amphibian in its jaws! How did it get there?!
No, it's too soon for you guys.
Yeah, you're right about that.
Maybe this should be more of a quiet game.
Hey guys!
Okay, look, yesterday I would've even considered calling her back, but my ex-wife calls on the same day I have a near death experience. I mean, that-that has got to mean something!
Right. I guess, I guess I should call Emily.
Okay, no, that's not the right decision. That's not, that's not right, no Ross-Ross, come on! I mean, that woman made you miserable! Okay, Ross, do you really want to get back into that?
Ugh, Ross! That was not a near death experience! That was barely an experience!
You weren't there! Okay, maybe this is something that I-I'm supposed to seize! Y'know?
Fine! It's your life! I just don't want to see you guys break up! Which you will do if you move in together, but that's what you want, there's nothing I can do. DON'T DO IT!!!!!
Yeah, I'm not so worried.
Yeah, no, me neither.
You still want to move in together right?
Of course!
No, I mean, look I don't know if anything is going to happen with us, again. Ever. But I don't want to know that it-it never could. So I stopped it and she got mad and broke my projector.
Look I-I realize if anything were to happen with me and Jill then nothing could ever happen with us!
What?!
Wow. I, I don't even know what to say. Thank you.
You're welcome.
It was 5:30 in the morning, and you had rambled on for 18 pages. Front and back!! Oh-oh-oh, and by the way, Y-O-U-apostrophe-R-E means 'you are,' Y-O-U-R means 'your!'
I fell asleep!
You fell asleep?!
Y'know I can't believe I even thought about getting back together again! We are so over!!
FINE BY ME!!
Oh look, did, did you just see that? Did you see? He just waved, he just waved, he's never waved before, you've never waved before. Yes he has. Very good.
Really? I mean, I, I had a whole speach prepared.
Oh shout, that would have been fun.
Hey.
Hey Phoebs, whatcha got there?
'That thing'? This is how you greet guests at a party? Let me ask you something, if I showed up here with my new girlfriend, she wouldn't be welcome in your home?
Par-tay!
That thing is not coming in here.
I'm guessing your new girlfriend wouldn't urinate on my coffee table.
Okay. He was more embarrassed about that than anyone. Okay? And for him to have the courage to walk back in here like nothing happened...
If like the four of us could all y'know, hang out together. Uh, in fact Emily's coming into town this weekend, why don't you say we all have dinner? Say, Sunday night?
Hey, y'know, y'know what would make me really happy?
Oh yeah, no, what's that?
That would be great!
Yeah, all right, it's a date.
Okay, maybe this is so hard, because there aren't 50 states. Let me tell you something, I have 49 states, and there are no more! I-I think, I should be able to eat something.
It is so good to see you!
Yeah, she came all the way back from Ross' building. Oh, the things she must have seen! And then she climbed up the fire escape and she tapped on the window with her teeny little paw and then we ran to let her in... I went to far, didn't I? When should I have stopped?
It's up to you.
Oh, hi! How are you doing?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, ho, ho, ho, you did not win the game, the touchdown didn't count, because of the spectacularly illegal, oh and by the way savage nose breaking.
It was soo not an accident. She saw I was about to tag her, so she threw her big fat grandma arm elbow right into my face. And just keep running.
To score the winning touchdown, by the way.
I won the game.
Oh yeah! Then how come you didn't get the Geller Cup?
Nah, I dunno... I think you reach a certain age, having a roommate is kinda pathe- ....sorry, that's, that's 'pathet', which is Sanskrit for 'really cool way to live'.
Yeah. I mean, it's been kinda quiet since Carol left, so...
Why don't you just get a roommate?
So you guys, I'm doing all new material tonight. I have twelve new songs about my mother's suicide, and one about a snowman.
Might wanna open with the snowman.
No, no, no... why, because it might get weird for everyone else? Who cares about them. This is about us. Look, I-I've been in love with you since, like, the ninth grade.
Rachel, come on. Give us a chance.
Ross, it's too hard.
Ross, you're like my best friend.
I know.
Oh. Listen, do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerability become any kind of a factor here- but do you think it would be okay if I asked you out? Sometime? Maybe?
You did! Oh.... I always figured you just thought I was Monica's geeky older brother.
I did.
Yeah, maybe...
Okay... okay, maybe I will...
Well I...I told him that if he ever hurt you I would hunt him down and kick his ass! What?! What?! What is the matter with everybody?! I am serious! I would kick his ass!
Wow Monica! Hey, just so you know I had my uh, older brother chat with Chandler.
What is that?
Ross, please! My make-up!
Hi.
Dad, dad, please. Look I don't want anything to upset Emily tonight. Alright, she's had a hard enough couple of days as it is. Now here, here, let me go talk to him, okay?
How could it be so much? The receptions at their house.
Flowers, liquor, recarpet first floor. New guest bath, landscaping. I'm paying to remodel this guys house. I'm going to give that son on a bitch, a piece of my mind.
And you tell him no one takes advantage of the Gellers.
Ooh, Jack.... Sometimes I forget how powerful you can be.
Well, I tracked down Marcel and get this, he's healthy, he's happy, and he's right here in New York filming Outbreak II - The Virus Takes Manhattan.
I'm not saying you have to be Barney.
Who's Barney.
You're kidding.
This is amazing.
Okay, uh, about last night, um, Chandler.. you didn't tell... Okay, 'cause I'm thinking- we don't need to tell Chandler, I mean, it was just a kiss, right? One kiss? No big deal? Right?
Hey, is Chandler here?
Yeah.
Right. No big deal.
Okay.
It was soo not an accident. She saw I was about to tag her, so she threw her big fat grandma arm elbow right into my face. And just keep running.
No, no, no, you say that proudly.
Anyway, Ross and I were always captains, and um, it got kind've competitive and one year, Geller Bowl VI, I accidentally broke Ross's nose.
To score the winning touchdown, by the way.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, ho, ho, ho, you did not win the game, the touchdown didn't count, because of the spectacularly illegal, oh and by the way savage nose breaking.
Yeah, I still don't know. I'm sorry I just wanna make sure that I bought the right couch. I need a couch that says, "Kids welcome here." But that also says, "Come here to me!"
Oh, y'know what? The last time Joey went to a meadow, his mother was shot by a hunter.
Ugh!
What?! You say that to kids?!!
No! No! No! The "Come here to me" is y'know for the ladies.
What? Whoa, whoa whoa whoa, what do you mean, back to Jordie? We never landed on Jordie. We just passed by it during the whole Jessy, Cody, Dylan fiasco.
No-no-no. I don't have a son named Jordie. We all agreed, my son's name is Jamie.
Well, Jamie was the name of Susan's first girlfriend, so we went back to Jordie.
Ow, ow, ow, ow, leg cramp, leg cramp, leg cramp.
I got it.
Hey, hey buddy, Marcel. Marcel. In the jungle, the mighty jungle the lion sleeps tonight. In the jungle, the mighty jungle the lion sleeps tonight. a-weema-way, a-weema-way.....
Yeah, and I have a time share in the Pocanos with Flipper.
Ross, there he is.
Uh, excuse me folks this is a uhh...
Closed set. We know but we're friends with the monkey.
He is saving your butt, ah, unless of course I'm stepping on some toes here, in which case I can just mosey on, I've got plenty of people to help on the Interstate.
Hi!
What is he doing here?!
No! Come on!
All right!! Fine! Fine.
Look, I was nervous! You guys had me all worried I was going to be boring! I got up there and they were all like staring at me. I opened my mouth and this British accent just came out.
Right! So when Rigby got his samples back from the laboratory he made a startling discovery! What he believed to be igneous, was in fact sedimentary. Imagine his consternation when- Oh bloody hell.
What the hell are you doing?!
Yeah, and not a very good one.
Will you-will you please?
Who's Richard Burke? Doc, Doctor Burke? You have a date with Doctor Burke? Why, why, why should that bother me? I, I love that man, he's like a uh, brother to dad.
Oh, I promise, what.
It's Richard Burke.
Well for your information he happens to be one of the brightest, most sophisticated, sexiest men I've ever been with.
Doctor Burke is sexy?
Hey Ross! It's you! I just want you to remember this feeling. You are lucky to be alive! So live everyday to the fullest. Love yourself, okay? Okay. Oh, and also get stamps. Bye!
Well, if you're gonna be totally rational about this, I can't argue with you! All right? Fine, if you wanna tell him, tell him. I just don't want to be a part of it.
Oh, maybe that's Emily calling back to leave the exact same message.
Wow! Play that message for Emily and this whole problem goes away!
Right?
No, no. The vet says unless he's in a place where he has regular access to some... monkey lovin,' he's just gonna get vicious. I've just gotta get him into a zoo.
I know. I know. I mean, one day, he's this little thing, and before you know it, he's this little thing I can't get off my leg.
Isn't there any way you can keep him?
How do you get a monkey into a zoo?
I know that one! ...No, that's Popes into a Volkswagen.
Well, not really. I mean technically it's-it's not against the rules or anything, but it is frowned upon. Especially by that professor we ran into last night, Judgey von Holierthanthou.
We had such a great time! She's-she's incredible! I thought the-the age difference might be a problem, but it wasn't. It wasn't at all. Elizabeth is very mature for her age. A concept lost on some people!
So it's okay to date a student.
Well Ross, you be careful now. You don't want to get a reputation as y'know Professor McNailshisstudents.
Yeah. What-what should I do?
Well, because y'know there are certain rules about this kind of stuff. You don't uh, you don't fool around with your uh, friend's ex-girlfriends or possible girlfriends or girls they're related to.
I just wanted to tell you something before you heard it from someone else and I hope this isn't too weird, but uh, I had uh, a thing with Janice. What you're-you're not mad?
Why would I be mad?
I am mad! But you know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna forgive you! Because that's what friends do! They forgive their friends when they do everything you just said, all on the list there. Well, but I want you to remember that I forgave you.
Okay.
Hello? Hey Mon, how's the packing going? Ben? He's fine. Yeah, he's right-Oh my God! Get your head of your shirt there son! What? Yeah, it's a pumpkin. I'll come pack.
Oh that's right. You're still set on that?
Kinda. Oh my God!
Hey!
What's wrong?
Don't thank me! If you wanna thank something, thank the volcano that erupted thousands of years ago, killing but perfectly preserving an entire civilization. Here's Warren's number.
Okay, there's this guy, Warren, from the museum and he's going on a dig for like two years and he's got this great place he needs to sublet. So uh, you interested?
That sounds great! I'd love to live at Warren's!! I love Warren! Thank you!
Oh, this is great! I am gonna call him right now! Oh, thank you!
Okay, you go grab it!
Ok, Phoebe, this is it. In this briefcase I carry actual scientific facts. A briefcase of facts, if you will. Some of these fossils are over 200 million years old.
Well, then, you'll just have to eat the other lamps.
Uh-oh. It's Scary Scientist Man.
Ok, look, before you even start, I'm not denying evolution, ok, I'm just saying that it's one of the possibilities.
It's the only possibility, Phoebe.
That does not sound stupid to me. You know, it's like the first time I had to make dinner for myself, after Carol left me? I'm sorry, that's all the time we have. Next on Ross... Uh-oh.
All right. Well, there you go. Stop it, stop it, stop it.
Ok, I know this is gonna sound really stupid, but I feel that if I can do this, you know, if I can actually do my own laundry, there isn't anything I can't do.
What uh-oh?
Uh-oh, uh-oh, the laundry's done. It's, uh, it's a song. The laundry song that we sing. Uh-oh the laundry's done, uh-oh, uh-oh.
Well, yeah, kinda. Um, but that's okay, see we have an understanding, um, see we each have this list of five famous people, so I'm allowed to sleep with you. No, no, no, it's flattery.
Hi! Hi, I'm Ross, you don't know me, but I'm a big, big fan of yours. I mean, Blue Velvet, woo-oo hoo! Um, I was wondering if I could um, maybe buy you a cup of coffee? Or maybe reimburse you for that one?
Aren't you with that girl over there?
I'm sorry.
Oh no, no, no, wait, wait, Isabella. Don't, don't just dismiss this so fast. I mean this is a once in a lifetime opportunity...
Believe me, I've been dreaming about me and Rachel for ten years now. But now, I'm with Julie, so it's like me and Julie, me and Rachel, me and Julie, me and... ... Rachel. Rachel, Rachel.
You got all that from saline solution?
We are talking about Rachel here. You and Rachel.
Hey, you.
How are you?
Okay, I'm sorry, this is insane! I-I-I'm not addicted to heroin, I'm not gay, and there is no problem with my ability to consummate anything! Look, I'll consummate this marriage right here, right now!
Ross, please, I found the magazines!
And finally that you were unable to consummate the marriage. Well, that makes sense since you're gay and addicted to heroin.
That won't be necessary.
And when we were dating we consummated like bunnies!
...and it was Ernst Muhlbrat who first hypothesized that the Velociraptor would expand it's collar and emit a high pitched noise to frighten it's predator. Yes Mr. Lewis?
Okay, I'll go!
No!! You are getting married! This is all I have.
What kinda noise?
Just a high pitched intimidating noise.
See but, Pheebs that-that is the exact opposite intent of my music. Y'know my music is-is meant to inspire, and if it bothers you this much, then I... I won't play anymore.
Pheebs...
Yeah, I-I can't-I mean y'know I was trying to be really y'know okay and upbeat about it, I just-I feel so dwarfed by your musical gift. I...
Oh no. No-no-no, don't do that! How could I live with myself if I knew I was depriving the world of your music.
Yeah, okay.
Joey come-I can't believe-I bring you here to see the Bapstein-King comet, one of nature's most spectacular phenomenon, and all you care about are bugs stuck in tar and-and some woman!
What? Is it the comet?
No! No-no. Look, there's a bug stuck in tar right here.
Y'know, there's two women dude.
Show me where?
Ok, ok, now what is wrong with my Snuggles? What, it says I'm a sensitive, warm kinda guy, you know, like a warm, fuzzy bear. Ok, I can pick something else up on the way.
No.
Oh, and uh, the fabric softener?
There you go.
Thank you. So what does this Bob guy look like? Is he tall? Short?
Yeah, well my-my ex-wife and I share custody of Ben and umm, uh, and just so you know, Carol and I are on excellent terms as I'm sure you are with your wife! Oh, I'm sorry! It's unbelievable!
No! No! Not-I don't mean I-I see her as a twelve-year-old girl! I mean I-I have a son, who's umm six and I still think of him as a baby.
You have a son?
Don't worry about it, I just didn't realize you were married.
Oh we were, but that was just a , I mean that was just a big drunken mistake.
I dont know whether hes testing me, or just acting out, but my monkey is out of control. But, he keeps erasing the messages on my machine, "supposedly" by accident.
Yeah. Okay great. Im gonna be over here.
No, no, no!
No, yeah, Ive done that.
And then, like three days in a row he got to the newspaper before I did, and peed all over the crossword.
Basically he told me to get over myself and just do it, ya know. So I though about what you said and I though about what he said and, well, his way I get to have sex tonight so. . .
Well, I was going to, but after I talked to you, I talked to Joey.
What did, what did he say?
What's this in my pocket? Why it's Joey's porno movie.
Pop it in.
She's having lunch with him. She's having lunch with him. And you should of seen the hug she gave him when she got the job. And, and, and, he's really good looking. What am I gonna do?
A stripper at a bachelor party, that is so clich. Why don't you get a magician?!
Well, if the magician can open my beer with his but cheeks, then all right.
Don't do anything. Keep it inside. Learn how to hide your feelings! Don't cry outloud.
Yes! Guess who's in an audition for a Broadway musical?
No. So what. So what if we get beaten up, maybe that's just something every man has to go through once in his life. Ya know, like a, like a right of passage or somethin'.
Yeah, sure.
By someone besides Monica?
Well, couldn't we just lose our virginities again? Ya know, because I think actually mine's growing back.
I need to borrow a hundred bucks.
I'd bet I'd still be doing my kara-tay. Towards the end of our marriage I was doing a lot of kara-tay as a way of releasing the tension from y'know, not doing anything else physical.
The first time! No seriously, imagine if Carol hadn't realized she was a lesbian.
I can't. I keep seeing it the good way.
Maybe the problem was you were pronouncing it kara-tay.
And what if I was still fat? Well, you wouldn't be dating me, that's for sure.
Well, it was loong. I didn't even realise how late it was, until I noticed the 5 o'clock shadow on her head. Anyway, she didn't want to stay. I called a cab; she just left.
It's over.
Oh, was it awful?
I wrote you a letter.
Ohh! Thank you! I like mail.
Well, I tried! But when I got to my lawyer's office all I could hear was, "Three divorces. Three divorces!" Look, I just don't want my tombstone to read, Ross Gellar, Three Divorces.
I know.
Ross?!
Don't be worried about that! Your tombstone can say whatever you want it to say! It could say, Ross Geller, Good at Marriage! Y'know? Mine's gonna say Phoebe Buffay, Buried Alive.
Look, all I know is I-I can't have another failed marriage!
And what--What are you typing that for? Did you hear what she said? We don't get the annulment. Don't type that! What?! Stop typing! Hey! Stop typing! Stop typing! Stop typing!!
That's great! Are you happy now? Look what you did with your funny, funny form!
What?! Me?! What about you and your consummated like bunnies nonsense!
Okay, do you see, do you see what you're keeping me married too?!
You need to get out of my chambers.
I'm sorry, man. Hey, y'know what you should do? You should make something happen for yourself. Y'know, like-like write a play. Write a movie! Huh? I mean, what about those Good Will Hunting guys?
Oh, I'm going to give him something else besides joy, just...
That part was perfect for me! I can't believe I didn't get it!
Come on Ross be realistic, y'know? If I did write something, what are the chances I could get those guys to star in it?
Wait a second, I could star in it!
He was unbelievable. He was like that-that-that Bugs Bunny cartoon where Bugs is playing all the positions, right, but instead of Bugs it was first base-Alan, second base-Alan, third base-...
Fantastic! I have one question: How is that possible?
Alan.
I mean, it-it was like, it was like he made us into a team.
Yep, we sure showed those Hassidic jewellers a thing or two about softball..
Hey-yeah. Hey Gunther, can I have a scone please? Wanna hear some good news? Someone I know is getting married! Yeah! And weddings are happy occasions! Oh, by-the-by it's my ex-wife Emily!
Hey Ross!
Hey!
What? Oh!
Sorry man.
That is a great idea! And! I know Ugly Naked Guy because we've been watching him for like five years so that gives me back my edge! Oh, let's see now he had the trampoline.
I'm listening.
See?
He broke that.
Well, he had gravity boots.
Oh OK. Well then why don't you, uhh, why don't you borrow it from mom and dad? You feel guilty and tense around them already. You might as well make some money off of them.
Monica, if you want, I can lend you some money.
No no no, if I couldn't pay you back right away then I'd feel guilty and tense every time I saw you.
Ya know, the man's got a point.
What is that sparkly thing?
Well we-we don't know for sure. But in my head it-it sounded something like this. Of course, this is just conjecture. Okay, that's uh, that's all for today. Uh Mr. Morse, can I see you for a moment?
Just a high pitched intimidating noise.
But like how?
Yes sir.
Mr. Morse I need to talk to you about your mid-term exam, I'm afraid I-I had to fail you.
The ride broke down. So, Carol and I went behind a couple of those mechanical Dutch children... then they fixed the ride, and we were asked never to return to the Magic Kingdom.
Disneyland, 1989, 'It's a Small World After All.'
No way!
Oh, Rachel.
Oh come on, I already went.
Hey! So, uhh, Amanda just-just dropped me off. Yeah, that's one of the things I love about her, she's...uh, she's old enough to drive. So uhh, I guess you're not going to mom and dad's tonight?
Okay, what do you saw I go over there and say how much I like her? No-no it'll be good, I can tell her much I've been thinking about her. That I haven't stopped thinking about her since the moment I met her. That I'm so fantastically, over-the-top, wanna-slit-my-own-throat in love with her, that for every minute of every hour of every day I can't believe my own damn bad luck that you met her first!!
Well, that's pretty good. But you might wanna tone it down a little.
No, sorry.
Well where's Amanda?
Little girl misses her cat. Crazy lady thinks her mother is in a cat. Okay, y'know what, I have to go have dinner with my son, can I trust that when you see Phoebe, you will tell her.
Yes, we have to tell her!
Oh, but it's made her so happy.
Yeah.
Thank you.
That's right, Ben. I'm Santa's representative for all the southern states. And Mexico! But, Santa sent me here to give you these presents, Ben. Maybe the Lady will help me with these presents.
Wow, come in, have a seat. You must be exhausted coming all the way from...Texas.
Texas?
Wow! Thanks!
You're welcome, Ben. Merry Christmas, ooh, and Happy Hanukkah!
See what? I don't know what she sees in... innn that goober. And it takes him, what? Like... like... I don't know, uhh... uhhh, hello.... a... week, to get out a sentence.
What do you mean?
Do you not see it?
Yeah, it's annoying, isn't it?
....................Yeah.
I am not in love with her. She was very upset about having to move out so I eh, didn't tell her we were still married because she would only get more upset. I-I just comforted her, as a friend.
No.
Of course not, because you're in love with her.
What do you mean, comforted her?
It's nothing, I just gave her a hug.
When we first met her, she was soaking, her feet were wet! Who wouldn't be miserable? I'm telling you when I got her into a dry pair of shoes, she was a totally different person.
How-how did end up in Vermont with that awful witch?!
Maybe, she doesn't hit him all the time.
Ross! Come quickly! There's a deer just outside eating fruit from the orchard!
I've gotta go, there's a deer just outside eating fruit from the orchard!
Please! Are you kidding? I-I hurt three huge men, I gave a guy a bloody nose-I mean I-I'm not proud of it but, I really am. And it's all because of you, wonderful, amazing you.
I made a man twice my size cry. I mean, I haven't done that since I was four and I washed my dad's Porsche with rocks.
You really enjoyed yourself didn't you?
I think you've got concussion.
No, no, I'm serious. Thank you.
She wants me to take responsibility for everything that went wrong in our relationship. I mean she goes on for five pages about, about how I was unfaithful to her! WE WERE ON A BREAK!!!!!
It does. It really and truly does.
It so does not!!!
Oh my God! If you say that one more time, I'm gonna break up with you!
Fine! Fine! But this break-up was not all my fault, and she, she says here, "If you accept full responsibility..." Full responsibility! "...I can begin to trust you again. Does that seem like something you can do. Does it?!!"
Y'know what? I-I-I... I-I have had enough of this! Y'know, I-I-I care a great deal about your daughter and I have treated her with nothing but respect! So if-if you've got a problem with me, frankly...
Now wait a minute that's not fair. He was married to me a hell of a lot longer than he was married to Emily, he just didn't tell me. Maybe I have to pee again.
Well, this is fun. So Ross, did you kill any of these wives?
Are you yelling at me?!
God no!
No, because she hasn't come home yet. And she hasn't been home all night! She's obviously staying with that other guy, and I'm the stupid moron who spent the whole night outside her apartment!
Hey.
Oh my God! Ross, are you in England? Was Emily surprised?
All right. When is, when is the next flight out?
About four hours.
Maybe I should get another pair! Ooh, y'know, they-they had some with fringe all down the sides. I'm gonna go kiss Ben goodnight. I can't believe he thinks I'm a cowboy. I would make a good cowboy.
That really is something; that's really cool.
Howdy partner!
Okay, now that everything's wrapped up here, I think I'm, I'm gonna go do my laundry.
Oh yeah, me too. Y'know if this shirt is dirty. Yep.
Ah, yeah, yeah. Umm, we started talking after she y'know, did her thing. And it turns out she's got a boy about Ben's age, so we're taking them to a gym-boree class. Why, is that okay?
You have a play date with a stripper?!
Man, I gotta get a kid.
Sure, is she married?
Ahh, no.
You know what the scariest part is? What if there's only one woman for everybody, y'know? I mean what if you get one woman- and that's it? Unfortunately in my case, there was only one woman- for her...
That only took me an hour.
Look, Ross, you gotta understand, between us we haven't had a relationship that has lasted longer than a Mento. You, however have had the love of a woman for four years. Four years of closeness and sharing at the end of which she ripped your heart out, and that is why we don't do it! I don't think that was my point!
What are you talking about? 'One woman'? That's like saying there's only one flavor of ice cream for you. Lemme tell you something, Ross. There's lots of flavors out there. There's Rocky Road, and Cookie Dough, and Bing! Cherry Vanilla. You could get 'em with Jimmies, or nuts, or whipped cream! This is the best thing that ever happened to you! You got married, you were, like, what, eight? Welcome back to the world! Grab a spoon!
I honestly don't know if I'm hungry or horny.
....right? Right? I mean it's pretty unbelievable y'know, I mean they just took off, took off without even looking back. Y'know I don't, I don't need them, huh, I've got you guys now as friends, you and Susan.
Then why are you smoking?
Well it's very unsettling.
Ah, Susan will be so pleased.
717? Where's 717? Hey, you've have more of these for Susan right?
Whoa, whoa, whoa. You looked at her. You never look. You just answer, it's just a reflex. Do I look fat? Nooo! Is she prettier than I am? Noo! Does size matter?
Okay, walk us through it, honey, walk us through it.
Okay, well. Janice said 'Hi, do I look fat today?' And I, I looked at her....
Nooo!
And it works both ways.
I have to say you are a much bigger person than I am. I mean after all we've been through, I just-y'know I wish I had a brother to reciprocate. Hey, if you ever want to go out with Monica, you have my blessing.
Yeah but after you said it was okay, I figured, "Why not?!"
Oh so-so not really never.
Oh-ho, and mine!
Chandler, I think I'm sick.
Oh mom! Okay, umm, her name is Carol. And she's really pretty. And smart. And uh, she's-she's on the lacrosse team and the golf team. Can you believe it? She plays for both teams!
Sorry!
Yes, yes Monica is thin. It's wonderful. But what we really want to hear about is Ross's new girlfriend.
So Chandler, I guess I'll see you at dinner.
Dude!
Oh yeah, she's-she's amazing. And-and she's so much fun. And! Y'know what? When I'm with her, I'm fun! I even signed up for helicopter classes. She's leaving in two days, I don't have to do it.
Right, I've got to be off, I'll see ya. Buh-bye then.
Wow! You guys seem to be having a good time.
Oh no, two days, you must be bummed.
Yeah, she's got to go back to London. But you know what? I've been prepared for this from the start. We both knew we had two weeks together, and that's it. Y'know.
Yeah, you want 55-JUMBO. Yeah, that's right. That's right, JUMBO with a U, sir. No, belive me, you don't want me. Judging by his number, I'd be a huge disappointment. All rightie, bye bye.
Yeah, hi, I was just beeped. No, Andr is not here. Third time today. Yes, I'm sure... No, sir. I don't perform those kind of services.
Services? Oh, services.
Hey, hey. How was the first day?
Oh, exellent. Everyone was so, so nice.
Well, I asked him if he wanted to eat, he said, "No." I asked him if he wanted to sleep, he said, "No." I asked him what he wanted to do, he said, "No." So, he's sweeping.
Hey!
Hey! How's Ben?
Hey, Ben! Hey!
So umm, any word from Susan?
Not, not, not every night. You know, and... and it's not like I didn't try, Rachel, but things got in the way, y'know? Like, like Italian guys or ex-fiances or, or, or Italian guys.
There was never a good time.
Right, you, you only had a year. We only hung out every night.
Hey, there was one Italian guy, OK, and do you even have a point?
The point is I... I don't need this right now, OK. It, it's too late, I'm with somebody else, I'm happy. This ship has sailed.
Oh see, I-I needed a new thing for today and there's this leather store that always smells so good and I thought to myself, "Wow, I never really owned a good smelling pair of pants before."
I like them a lot.
That's not what I had in mind! See, people like Ross don't generally wear these types of pants. You see, they're very tight. Maybe there's something in that area.
Oh come on!!
Okay, seriously, what do you think?
Emily that's ridiculous. Look, I'm-I'm moving for you, I'm cutting friends out of my life for you. Please, just get on the plane and come to New York. Okay, you'll see you're the only person I want to be with.
Look Emily, I'm just having dinner with my friends, okay?
You obviously can't keep away from her.
I'll feel better when I'm there, and I can know where you are all the time.
Well, you can't know where I am all the time. Look, this marriage is never gonna work if you don't trust me.
Yeah-uh-huh. Tomorrow night, Valentine's Day, the most romantic day of the year. Who knows what could happen? I might not be shutting my drapes to show her my slides, if you know what I mean.
Anyway, if she, if she wasn't in to me, why-why would she ask me out again?
She asked-asked you out again?
Okay-okay-okay-okay-okay-okay-okay! I got it! I got it! I got it! I can't! I can't! I can't! I cannot go with you and my sister thing. Okay? I just can't. It's just too weird, all right? I imagine the two of you together and I freak out. It freaks me out. I can't do it! I can't do it.
Okay! Okay! Okay! It's okay. It's okay. Hey, it's too weird for you, I won't see her again.
Y'know, okay. You're right. It is huge. So why don't we take it just a little bit at a time? Okay? Umm, forget getting married for a sec; just forget about it. Can you just come home and take a shower?
But look Chandler, right now, no one has a lower opinion of you than I do. But I totally believe you can do this.
I want to. I love her so much, but I'm afr...It's too huge.
Well yeah, but then...
Yeah-No-but-but-but-but! We're just gonna go home and take a shower. Now, that's not scary right?
No, there is no way he was a velociraptor. No Tony, look at the cranial ridge, OK. If Dino was a velociraptor, he would have eaten the Flintstones. Yeah, yeah. Oh, were you takin' a nap?
Honey, uh we, we can talk about this. It's just that it's costing about a hundred dollars a minute to be in here.
Oh OK. So, um, the cat stinks but you love it, let's go.
I was.
Oh I-, Oh wait, Tony can you hang on? That's the other line. Hello. Oh yeah she's here but uh, can she call you back? OK thanks. Call Joanna. Hi.
I didn't wanna leave him alone. Alright? We- we had our first fight this morning. I think it has to do with my working late. I said some things that I didn't mean, and he- he threw some faeces...
Okay, look, he's not gonna hurt them, right?
Do you always have to bring him here?
Y'know, if you're gonna work late, I could look in on him for you.
Oh, that'd be great! Okay, but if you do, make sure it seems like you're there to see him, okay, and you're not like doing it as a favour to me.
Hi, I was wondering if it is possible to increase security in the Paleontology section? See I-I wrote a book up there and instead of reading it people are-are-are well, rolling around in front of it.
No! No!! No! Can I speak to someone in charge please?!
How can I help you?
We are aware of the problem you are referring too. But as far as increasing security, I'm afraid the library is very understaffed. I, I can't help you.
Well, fine. Fine! If-if I'm the only person with any appreciation of the sanctity of the written word, I'll go up there and defend it myself! And don't you follow me!
Yeah. I don't know, I've been wanting this since like ninth grade typing, ya know. And I just want it to be perfect and right and. . . why isn't that laser beam cutting through the paint?
Yeah, but uh, it was 1982 and my flock of seagulls haircut was tickling her chin.
She laughed at you?
It's the Miracle Wax.
It certainly is a miracle.
What?! No! No! Wait! You're right, this is stupid. Who cares what people think? I mean, I mean we like each other right? There's nothing wrong with that. Come on. Burt? Lydia? Mel? This is Elizabeth.
What? No! Of course, of course I do! Are-are they gone?
Uh no, they're still here but I think I'm about to leave.
Hi!
Aren't you in my Popular Culture class?
Look, I... Look, I'm having a great time with you and I just don't want us to move to fast or put to much pressure on us. So, I'm sorry I just don't think we should go away together yet. It's-it's too soon.
Yeah, it kinda grows on you. Actually, I wanted to finish talking to you about uh, spring vacation.
Oh good.
Ross, I think you misunderstood what I was saying. I just wanted to tell you that I'm going to Florida for a couple weeks.
No. I think you misunderstood what I was saying. What I meant was...
Oh, well you see how it works is, the part with Dick Clark in Times Square is actually live, but they tape some of the party stuff ahead of time. Yeah, not a lot of people know that.
Totally! I would love to spend New Year's with you.
Well actually they're taping tomorrow. I don't really understand why.
Yeah well, do you guys wanna come too?
Are you serious?
I'm supposed to attach a brackety thing to the side things, using a bunch of these little worm guys. I have no brackety thing, I see no whim guys whatsoever and- I cannot feel my legs.
Oh, I wish I could, but I don't want to.
Love is sweet as summer showers, love is a wondrous work of art, but your love oh your love, your love...is like a giant pigeon...crapping on my heart. La-la-la-la-la- Thank you. La-la-la-la...ohhh!
I'm thinking we've got a bookcase here.
It's a beautiful thing.
Well then that's it. And if George and Adelaide can't accept that, then the hell with them. Look, if my parents didn't want me to marry you, no way that would have stopped me. Look, this is your wedding. Do it.
Look, do you love her? And you don't have to be too emphatic about this.
Of course I do.
You're right. Of course you're right.
So we're back on?
Well, I was with Carol for like eight years and I lost her. And now if it's possible I think I love you even more. So, it's hard for me to believe that I'm not gonna, well that someone else is not going to take you away.
A big idiot. Just you have to realize is, this whole Mark thing is kinda hard for me.
Honey, why is it hard, I mean we've been together for almost a year now?
Let it be me! Let it be me!
Honey, that's very sweet, it just seems to me though, that if two people love each other and trust each other, like we do, there's no reason to be jealous.
I was the James Michener of dirty talk. It was the most elaborate filth you have ever heard. I mean, there were characters, plot lines, themes, a motif... at one point there were villagers.
Oh, I was unbelievable.
All right, Ross!
Whoa! And the... huh-huh?
Well, ahem... you know, by the time we'd finished with all the dirty talk, it was kinda late... and we were both kind of exhausted, so uh...
Y-ello. No, Rachel's not here right now, can I take a message? Alright, and how do we spell Casey, is it like at the bat or and the Sunshine Band? OK, bye-bye. Hey, who's this uh, this Casey?
Aaaahhhhhhh.
I'm outa here.
Oh, some guy she met at the movies.
Oh really? What uh, what does he want with her?
Oh, I know. Y'know what, I never would've gotten this if it weren't for you. No really, when I'm with you I'm-I'm like this whole other guy, I love that guy! I mean, I love you too, a lot, but that guy! I-I love that guy!
Uh, I don't know, whatever.
I think it makes you look really dangerous.
I love both of you!
Yeah?
Y'know, maybe she is too young for me. Y'know, when I was over there and she was running around with her friends, I felt like I was a baby-sitter. I finally started to see what you guys were talking about. I don't know what to do.
Yeah, I was but uh, she was a little busy with a water balloon fight.
Oh Ross, sometimes grown-ups have commitments they just can't get out of!
Why don't you just weigh out the good stuff about the relationship against the bad stuff. I mean that's what I did when I first weighing stuff.
Okay umm, bad stuff. Well, I'm-I'm 12 years older than she is.
No, no, it's okay. Really. They're plenty of people who just see their sisters at Thanksgiving and just see their college roommates at reunions and just see Joey at Burger King. So is, is that better?
I talked to Monica, look, I'm the one who made the choice. I'm the one who's making things change, so I should be the one to y'know, step back.
Oh, Ross...
No, it's not better. I still don't get to see you.
Well, what-what would you do? Rach, if you were me, what-what would you do?
He couldn't even tell me! He said it was just some sort of skin... abnormality. And the worst thing is he-he-he said, he said, without being able to identify it, he was reluctant to remove it.
Well, he said there's definitely nothing to worry about, it's totally benign.
Well what is it?!
Y'know what? You should go to my guy, because when I went in there with my third nipple. He just lopped it right off. Y'know? So I guess I'm lucky. I mean not as lucky as people who were born with two nipples.
At least they knew what yours was. Y'know, yours had a name.
Hey I'm sorry to do this to you again but uh, is there any way you can look after Ben for a little bit? I-I've got this meeting at school. And-and he-he asked for his uh, 'Fun Aunt' Rachel, so...
Hey!
Hey!
Ohhh! Well of course I will watch him! We have fun, don't we Ben?
Okay, I'll see you later pal.
I'm an idiot. I mean shoulda seen it, I mean Carol and I'd be out and she'd, she'd see some beautiful woman, and, and she'd be Ross y'know look at her, and I'd think, God, my wife is cool!
'Cause Carol's a lesbian. And, and I'm not one. And apparently it's not a mix and match situation.
Oh my God! I don't believe it! Oh, you poor bunny.
Aw! Hey, do you think that Susan person is her lover?
Well, now I do!!
Oh, no no no. Nono, this is just vintage Rachel. I mean, things just sort of happen around you. I mean, you're off in Rachel-land, doing your Rachel-thing, totally oblivious to people's monkeys, or to people's feelings...
Yeah, yeah. Y'know, now that you kicked the sign, hey! I don't miss Marcel any more!
Y'know, it is not like I did this on purpose.
Ross.
I don't even wanna hear it, you're just...
Hey, y'know what's weird? After you guys get married, when you introduce me to people you're gonna have to say, "This is my brother-in-law Ross." Not, "My friend Ross," "brother-in-law Ross." That's weird isn't it?
Is there a problem?
No! Oh what does he know! Come on Rosita, us chichas got to stick together! You bitch!
Couldn't I just say, "This is Ross?"
Sure, do whatever you want.
Uh, y'know what? I'll tell you who it hurts! It hurts the kid who has all his clothes stolen in gym class so he has to go to the principal's office wearing nothing but a catcher's mitt!
Oh my God!
Or Carol! But they're funny to kids and who is it hurting?!
That was you?! We heard about you in Junior High! Did you really just shake your fist in the air and shout, "I will be revenged?!"
I will be! Listen, I don't want you teaching my son that stuff anymore. Okay?
Okay! Okay! That's it!! Parents!! Parents!! Back away!! All right, this is our wedding day! From now on everyone gets along, and if I hear one more word. NO GRANDCHILDREN! That's right!!
Nothing, nothing. Everything's under control.
You want a piece of me, sir? Is that what your saying? You want a piece of me?
Okay, okay.
Sorry old boy, sorry. Sorry. Sorry. I could kill you with my thumb, you know.
I was having a little chat with ah, Bonnie, and ah, guess what, she-she happened to bring up y'know, who was behind the um, whole head shaving idea, and now, who was it? Oh, that's right, that's right, it was you!
Hi.
Hi!
That was her idea, I just gave her a nudge.
She said you gave her the razor!
It's awful I know, I mean, I feel terrible but I have to do this if I want my marriage to work. And I do, I have to make this marriage work. I have too. But the good thing is we can still see each other until she gets here.
...is for me not to see you anymore.
That's crazy! You can't do that! What are you going to tell her? Oh God. Ohh, you already agreed to this, haven't you?
Ohh! Lucky me! Oh my God! That is good news, Ross! I think that's the best news I've heard since Le Poo died!
You have no idea what a nightmare this has been. This is so hard.
Today's the day Carol and I first.. consummated our physical relationship. Sex. ..You know what, I-I'd better pass on the game. I think I'm just gonna go home and think about my ex-wife and her lesbian lover.
What's wrong with the twentieth?
Eleven days before Halloween.. all the good costumes are gone?
The hell with hockey, let's all do that!
C'mon, Ross! You, me, Joey, ice, guys' night out, c'mon, whaddya say, big guy, Huh? Huh? Huh?
No, um, see 'cause that, that is, that is the staging area. If you go in there, it'll ruin the whole illusion of the party. Yeah, I think you take your scotch back in there and I will get your cigarettes for you sir.
No. no.
Whad'ya mean no?
Get my glasses too.
All righty roo. What a great moment to say that for the first time.
Don't listen to your mother. You're independent, and you always have been! Even when you were a kid... and you were chubby, and you had no friends, you were just fine! And you would read alone in your room, and your puzzles...
Nothing! It's an expression.
No it's not.
Look, there are people like Ross who need to shoot for the stars, with his museum, and his papers getting published. Other people are satisfied with staying where they are- I'm telling you, these are the people who never get cancer.
...And I read about these women trying to have it all, and I thank God 'Our Little Harmonica' doesn't seem to have that problem.
Listen, I gotta tell ya, I-I'm having a great time! Y'know how before you said it might be weird, the whole student teacher thing, and to be frank I thought it would be too, but it's not. I mean it's not at all.
Umm, it's Cutie McPretty.
Ohh that's so sweet!
Dr. Geller!
Burt!
Great, actually. I'm thinking tonight, maybe the night. Yeah, I mean ah, the kids are gonna play together and then when they're asleep, I'm thinking Amanda and I break open a bottle of wine, and do a little "playing" ourselves.
Oh.
How's it going with her?
Hi guys! This is Josh. Josh, these are my friends, and that's Ross.
Hi, Josh.
Just a sandwich? Look, I am 30 years old, I'm about to be divorced twice and I just got evicted! That sandwich was the only good thing going on in my life! Someone ate the only good thing going on in my life!
My Thanksgiving leftover sandwich. I can't believe someone ate it!
Ross, it's just a sandwich!
Okay, look, I-I have enough stuff for one more sandwich, I mean I was going to eat it myself, but
That-that would be incredible. Thank you so much. I-I still can't believe someone ate it!! I mean, look, I left a note and everything.
I knew all I had to do was let the material speak for itself. Everyone's all, "Ross you have to be funny and sexy." Well, I proved them wrong! And now, I'm gonna pass the news onto Joey and Chandler.
It went great! And I didn't need any jokes or naked chicks either!
Wow, that's great Ross, I'm sorry we weren't more supportive before.
That you're not funny or sexy?
That's right!
Okay, remember, we were young. Hey, Spring break, sophomore year, I got high in my bedroom and my parents walked in and smelled it and so I told them that you had gotten stoned and jumped out the window.
Okay, I think I might know why my parents don't like you.
You do? Why?
What?! Why did you do that?
I don't know, aheh, your's was the first name that-that popped into my head, I'm I'm sorry. I-I didn't think it would matter.
Hey! I just got uh, my teacher evaluations! Check out what this one student wrote, "I loved Dr. Geller's class. Mind blowing lectures! Dr. Geller, you are definitely the hottie of the paleontology department!"
We should help him!
I... Well, I don't think they need any help.
Ahh, Hotties of the Paleontology Department, there's a big selling calendar, eh?
Who wrote it?
Ok, then you're gonna have to understand that you're with a guy who's not gonna stop planning his future with you because he knows that we're gonna end up together and if that scares you, tough, 'cause you're gonna have to deal with that.
We're not done.
I didn't know that.
Fine, I will.
Good, 'cause I love you.
I know! Anyway, they asked me to be a guest lecturer! I mean it's temporary, but uh, if they like me it could lead to a full time job. How great would that look great on a mailbox, huh? "Professor Geller."
Well remember that paper I had published last year on sediment flow rate, huh? They loved it.
Well, who wouldn't?!
Yeah, Professor and Mrs.
And Mrs.?!
I'm sorry, okay, I'm sorry. I wa-I was disgusted with myself, and this morning I was so, I was so upset and then I got your message and I was so happy, and all I wanted was to get her out of my apartment as fast as possible.
Should we do something?
Yeah, never cheat on Rachel.
Whoa!! Whoa, whoa, wait a minute. What time did your little friend leave? Oh my God. She was there? She was still there? She was in there, when I was in there?!
Listen. Oh hey, hey, the important thing was that she meant, she meant nothing to me!
I wanted this to work so much. I mean I'm still in there, changing his diapers, pickin' his fleas... but he's just phoning it in. Just so hard to accept the fact that something you love so much doesn't love you back.
Alright, somebody kiss me. Somebody kiss me, it's midnight! Somebody kiss me!
Alrightalrightalright. There.
...I think that bitch cracked my tooth.
Do you think they have yesterday's daily news?
Oh no! That-that'll just bring me down! This was great! I mean I-I-I was great! This is a great day! Y'know what? I'm buying everyone coffee. All right? If someone would just grab my wallet, it's in my pocket.
Hello, Mrs. Chatracus.
Now, are you sure you don't want to go see a doctor?
Yeah, sure.
No, not you.
Dad that won't matter to her. Look, all my stuff is safe and dry and all her is-is, is growing new stuff! See, this is exactly the kind of thing that makes her think you guys love me more than you love her.
Get your non-believer ass outta my chair!
Well, she'll understand right? It's not like I did it on purpose.
Oh my God, does she really thinks that?
Well, can you blame her?
Wow! Thanks, you guys. That's uh-ohhh, I wanna, I wanna play you another piece! Umm! Uh-oh! I left my uh, helicopter sounds on another disk. I'll be right back! Okay? This is so nice, I'm-I am so...
Really?! I mean, really?!!
Yeah, I mean, you should play in public!
Oh God bless my dad sound proofing the basement!
Oh, I can't believe I ever let him touch me with those fingers.
Look, I gotta go pick up Ben. Everything so far sounds great Joey, just remember to keep it on the mellow side, okay? Just a couple of guys hanging out playing poker, no-no strippers or anything okay?
Yeah, see, I don't think it's gonna that difficult considering this one won't be taking place in the basement of a Pizza Hut.
Oh, I'm Ross. I'm Ross. I'm too good for the Hut; I'm too good for the Hut.
You got it.
Okay, see ya later.
Look, you were right. She looks at me and sees a friend, that's all. But then I met Julie, and I don't know, we're havin' a great time. And I have to say, I never would've gone for it with her if it hadn't been for you.
It was you, pal.
Well, maybe it was God, doing me.
Well, you owe me one, big guy.
Here's your lemonade.
Really?! Hey, y'know what? Since you have such a great sense of what I need, uh ooh, here's-here's 60 bucks, why don't you take Phoebe down to that Colonial flea market of yours and get me some stuff.
Oh honey he doesn't need my help.
Oh, come on! I think he's ready to get rid of, what did you call it? The cheap knock-offs and dinosaur junk.
Y'know what? I don't, I don't think Phoebe really wants to come.
No! I do want to!
Okay, look, how is this gonna affect you? Really? I mean you fill some form out once and a while and instead of checking the box that says Ms you check the box that says Mrs.! It's right next to it!
I'm-I'm not kidding. Look I-I, I can't have three failed marriages. I can't. Okay? I-I am not gonna be that guy!
What-wh-what so we'll just stay married forever?!
Ohh, okay, I'm sorry. You're right. Y'know what? We absolutely can stay married, because I was under the impression that the boxes were far away from each other. All right, look, just please, take a moment here and think about what you're asking of me.
I'm asking you to do me a favor.
Okay umm, why don't we all take a seat, y'know? And uh, and I'll get us all some uh some coffees--Yeah, why don't you. Uh and you guys can talk about whatever, whatever you want. Y'know? Whatever pops into your head.
Ohh!
I get that a lot.
Y'know, it is so strange seeing Ross here this time of day, 'cause usually he's got the children's hospital.
Yeah. Not looking for dates.
Yes, it was the trophy you got if you won the game. But our Dad said, 'nobody won that game, ' and he was sick of our fighting, so he took the trophy and.... threw it in the lake.
Oh yeah! Then how come you didn't get the Geller Cup?
Um, there was a Geller Cup?
And was the curse lifted?
Anyway. That's when our Mom said we were not to play football ever again.
Oh hey, hey, huh, how about this weekend we have a laser disc marathon okay, and maybe a tournament on my new dart board? Huh, huh, what do you think? Two days of darts, it'll be great!
Look, you guys I just wanna say, I really, really appreciate you spending this time with me. It's been a pretty hard time right now, so I just wanna say thanks.
Can somebody else hug him? I have to stay by the window.
It'll be great for next weekend.
No, no, no, this weekend guys!
Ok. Well, before I say anything, I just need to know, is this one of those things where you break up with a guy, and then I tell you what I think, and then the next day you get back together with the guy, and I look like a complete idiot?
What's goin' on?
Well, first of all, Paulo and I are not back together. It was just a stupid thing I did, and if I could go back in time and do it again, well, I wouldn't. Um, second of all , what?
No. No-no-no-no.
Well, then, I think, I think the guy is scum. I hate him. I mean I actuallyI-I physically hate him. I always have. You are way too good to be with a guy like that.
Yeah, see, we-we-we have to stop across the hall, because it's my sister. But, uh, uh y'know actually, growing up with a sister was nice because it really helped me understand women. Yeah, you-you should tell your friends that.
No, but you should go to Chandler's. Because none of us knows how to cook, we'll probably just end up drinking all day.
Ye-ye, we go to yours!
Okay.
How you got three women to marry you, I'll never know.
Well I don't know umm, what if we were too tie each other up? Umm, some people eat stuff off one another. Nah! Umm, y'know we-we could try dirty talk? Umm, we could, we could have a threesome.
Yay! Seriously, our sex life... I was thinking, maybe I don't know, we could try some-some new things. Y'know? For fun?
Like what?
I love that idea!
Who sold a story to Archie Comics?!
Okay! Fine! Fine! If-if this is what you think, forget about the whole three divorce thing! Okay, I-I'll go to my lawyer's office right now and get this marriage annulled! Okay?! Because she means nothing to me! Noth--Nothing!!
Look, I'm sorry, but you guys are wrong. I just don't want to be divorced three times.
Yes, and now he's using this three divorces reason because he wants to stay married to her because he loves her. I must say, "Well done!" Bravo Meg.
Okay now I wouldn't date you because you seem a little creepy.
I am so attracted to him right now.
This is my son having lunch, ok? It's gonna happen a lot, so you'd better get used to it. Now if you have any problem with it, if you're uncomfortable, just ask questions. Carol's fine with it, now come on.
Look, would you guys grow up? That is the most natural beautiful thing in the world.
Yeah, we know, but there's a baby suckin' on it.
Carol?
Carol? I was just wondering if Joey could ask you a question about breast-feeding?
Well, of course you can defend yourself from an attack you know is coming, that's not enough. Look, I studying kara-tay for a long time, and there's a concept you should really be familiar with. It's what the Japanese call unagi.
After one class? I don't think so.
What? You wanna see me self-defend myself?! Go over there and pretend you're a sexual predator! Go on! I dare ya!!
Isn't that a kind of sushi?
No, it's a concept!
Right! So when Rigby got his samples back from the laboratory he made a startling discovery! What he believed to be igneous, was in fact sedimentary. Imagine his consternation when- Oh bloody hell.
Yeah, but y'know we could sneak in and watch.
Yeah, we could. Oh hey look! There's some Kappa Kappa Deltas! I was a Kappa. Hey sisters! Wow, we really are bitches.
What the hell are you doing?!
Look, I was nervous! You guys had me all worried I was going to be boring! I got up there and they were all like staring at me. I opened my mouth and this British accent just came out.
Naa. A while ago I got a sah out of him, which I thought, ya know, might turn into sah-condary caregiver but... Hey, would you uh, would you hold him for a sec, 'cause I, I gotta take this off.
Hi, we're visitiing. It's Ben and his da-da. Da-da. Can you say da-da? Look, I'm gonna tell your momies you said it anyway so you might as well try.
No luck huh?
Oh, yeah sure, Ok.
What're you doing?
Uh-huh. Well, when the psychiatrist told me I had to take a leave of absence because I yelled at my boss I started to get worked up again, so he offered me a tranquilizer. And I thought was a good idea so, I took it.
He gave me a pill for it.
A pill?
Wait a minute, they're making you take time off work?
And you're okay with that?
My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I'm not, I can't do-
Of course not, I'm... suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch.
Oh, no, nonononono, you see what he's doing? He knows no-one's gonna say all those names, so they'll wind up calling her Geller, then he gets his way!
Knock knock!How are we today? Any nausea?
Yeah. Yeah. A little.
No, I-I got really hot in my leather pants so I took them off but they must have shrunk from the-the sweat or-or-or my legs expanded from the heat. Look, I-I can't put them back on. I can't!
Listen, I'm in Elizabeth's bathroom...
Nice!
Oh. That is quite a situation. Uh, do you see any like, powder?
Powder! Yeah! Yeah, I have powder!
And I guess, you know, sometimes, she's a little ditzy, you know. And I've seen her be a little too into her looks. Oh, and Julie and I, we have a lot in common 'cause we're both paleontologists, but Rachel's just a waitress.
I don't know. I mean, all right, I guess you can say she's a little spoiled sometimes.
You could say that.
Waitress. Got it. You guys wanna play Doom? Or we could keep doing this. What else?
I don't know.
I just, I hate this so much! I mean, every time I go pick her up at the airport, it's-it's so great. But at the same time I'm thinking, "Well, I'm gonna be right back there in a couple of days, dropping her off."
Yeah!! Yeah!
Easy tiger.
So what are you going to do?
Nothing! There's nothing to do! I mean, she lives there, I live here. I mean, she-she'd have to uh, move here. She should move here!
Look, look, there's got to be a way we can work past this. Okay, I can't imagine, I can't imagine my life without you. Without, without these arms, and your face, and this heart. Your good heart Rach, and, and....
Okay, okay. This morning you said there was nothing so big that we couldn't work past it together...
Yeah, what the hell did I know!
No. I can't, you're a totally different person to me now. I used to think of you as somebody that would never, ever hurt me, ever. God, and now I just can't stop picturing with her, I can't, it doesn't matter what you say, or what you do, Ross. It's just changed, everything. Forever.
Yeah, but this can't be it, I mean.
Okay, I did not abandon Rachel! Okay? Emily showed up at the airport! I had to go after her! I mean, I-I did what I had to do! She's my wife! Rachel is my wife! Y'know-Emily! Emily, is my wife! Man, what is that?
Oh, so-so you talked to her. Did she, did she sound mad?
No, but she likes me. You abandoned her on a plane to Greece.
So you still hadn't heard from Emily?
No, not since I lost her at the airport.
Come here, here, come here, come here, Mrs. Buffay. Sorry, about what I said, umm, it was, it was insensitive of me to say that you were just a cat. When clearly you are also the reincarnated spirit, of my friend's mother.
You could.... say you're sorry to her mom.
I think she would like that.
Thank you. We both forgive you.
So honey, what are you gonna do about the little girl?
Well, her thought is, and I agree, fresh new furniture, why not a fresh new apartment? Her cousin has this great place to sublet, it's got a view of the river on one side and Columbia on the other.
Nothing. Oh, actually, great news! I just got off the phone with Emily and it looks like I'm moving to a new apartment. Woo-hoo!
Why?
That's way uptown! That's like three trains away! Which is great! I love to ride that rail!
So you're really okay with this?
Phoebe! You're note, amazing! Not only did no one touch my sandwich, but people at work are actually afraid of me. Yeah, a guy called me mental! Mental Geller, yeah, I always wanted a cool nickname like that.
Phoebe!
Yeah?
Yeah, the best you got in high school was Wet Pants Geller.
That was the water fountain! Okay?! Anyway, people are writing reports for me, uh pushing back deadlines to meet my schedule, I'm telling you, you get tough with people you can get anything you want. Hey Tribbiani, give me that coffee! Now!
No, no, no. Technically the... sex is not... being had, but that's... see, that's not the point. See, um, the point is that... Rachel and I should be, er, together. You know, and if you get in the.... um...
Thing, yes. Thing.
Ah, you... have the sex?
Bed?
No, no, that's not where I was going. Er, if you get in the... way, of us becoming a thing, then I would be, well, very sad.
Yeah, y'know how I have you guys, well she doesn't really have any close friends that are just hers, but last week she meet this woman at the gym, Susan something, and they really hit it off, and I-I-I think it's gonna make a difference
Oh, better, actually. Y'know I-I-I think I finally figured out why we were having so much trouble lately.
Oh, really?
Soo, ah, Eric, what kind of photography do ya do?
Oh, mostly fashion, so there may be models here from time to time, I hope that's cool.
No no no, believe me. No one has been waiting for this as much as I have, ok? And you know what the funny thing is? When this day is over, you get to go home with the baby, ok? Where does that leave me?
Come on, come on. Damnit, damnit, damnit, damnit. This is all your fault. This is supposed to be, like, the greatest day of my life, y'know? My son is being born, and I should be in there, you know, instead of stuck in a closet with you.
The woman I love is having a baby today. I've been waiting for this just as much as you have.
You get to be the baby's father. Everyone knows who you are. Who am I? There's Mother's Day, there's Father's Day, there's no... Lesbian Lover Day.
Every day is Lesbian Lover Day.
I tell you one thing, I wouldn't mind having a piece of this sun-dried tomato business. Five years ago, if somebody had said to me, here's a tomato that looks like a prune, I'd say "get out of my office!"
oh, oh, oh! This is so great! Oh my god! This was not at all scary. Hi everybody. Hi Betty! Betty, Hi! You found Betty! Oh my god! This is great. Everybody I love is in the same room, Where's Joey?
Did you see Betty?
Dad, before I was born, did you freak out at all?
I'm not freaking out, I'm just saying, if somebody had come to me with the idea andndash;
Come on! The time we were all waiting in line for Dances With Wolves and that one guy cut in line in front of us and I just lost it?! Screamed at him! Turned all red! Red Ross!!
Okay, I know what I have to do. I've got to go Red Ross. Y'know, Red Ross!
I totally don't know what you're talking about.
No.
You'll see.
Ben, I want you to know that there may be some times when I may not be around, like this. But I'll still always come back, like this. And sometimes I may be away longer, like this. But I'll still always come back, like this.
The head, the head. You gotta...
Hi, Ben. Hi. I'm your Aunt Monica. Yes I am. I'm your Aunt Monica. I...I will always have gum.
And sometimes, I'll want you to steal third, and I'll go like this.
He is so amazing.
Well, it turns out that she is going to Daytona for spring break woo-hoo. That means, that means wet T-shirt contests, guys doing shots off of girl's bodies, waking up next to people you don't even know...
Okay.
Well, there you are! So what did Elizabeth say?
Man, she is going to have a great time! Is she staying at the Hotel Corona?
You know the hotels?
No! No! Look-Hey, enough is enough! Look, I am sorry that you feel guilty or whatever about spending time with your new mom, but this is not your old mom. This is a cat! Okay, Julio the cat! Not mom! Cat!
Ohh. Um-hmm. But y'know, she choose to find me. I mean, I have to respect her decision. Right?
That's a good call. Right.
Ross, how many parents have you lost?
None.
I just wanted to thank you again for last night, what a great party! And the guys from work had a blast. Y'know, one of them had never been to a bachelor party before. Yeah! And-and another one had never been to a party before, so...
Hey!
Hey...
So uh, hey, that uh, that wedding ring, huh? Man, that's nice!
Yeah, right!
Well, like that, only instead of a chair, it's a pile of garbage. And instead of a jacket, it's a pile of garbage. And instead of the end of the day, it's the end of time, and garbage is all that has survived! Here.
You know how you throw your jacket on a chair at the end of the day?
Yeah.
Wow. Thanks. So, uh, what happened?
What do you mean? Nothing happened! I had to get out of there.
We had such a great time! She's-she's incredible! I thought the-the age difference might be a problem, but it wasn't. It wasn't at all. Elizabeth is very mature for her age. A concept lost on some people!
Oh! Hello? Yeah this is Phoebe. Really?!
Yeah, so it turns out that it wasn't the hair straightener that started the fire. No-no, it was the candles. It's very not good leaving candles unattended. In fact, one of the first things they teach you in fire school is... Uhh... Uhh... Okay. Well, I have to go now.
So it's okay to date a student.
Well, not really. I mean technically it's-it's not against the rules or anything, but it is frowned upon. Especially by that professor we ran into last night, Judgey von Holierthanthou.
Well, I was just playing with him, and y'know we were doing the alphabet song, which he used to be really good at, but suddenly he's leaving out 'e' and 'f.' It's like they just ah, I don't know, fell out of his head.
Umm, did you notice anything wierd about Ben today?
No. Why?
Really?!
Oh, and also, he's, he's walkin' kind of funny, his left leg is moving a lot faster than his right leg, and he's in there just sort of y'know...
Yeah, yeah, just a tough day at work. A stegosaurus fell over and trapped a kid. Whoa, whoa, I know this jacket, this is, th--Fun Bobby's jacket! Where is he, what. He, he's here, isn't he?
Hiiiiii.
Are... are you OK?
Maybe.
Don't toy with me.
It was pretty funny when I, when I hid it for a while, huh? Anyway, umm, I-I am worried about that bathing suit, not because it's revealing which I'm fine with, no I'm concerned about your health, sun exposure.
Yeah. And did you, did you pack that bathing suit?
Yeah.
Oh, don't worry I have plenty of sun block, it's SPF-30.
Well, if what's in the bottle is actually 30. I mean sometimes you get 30, sometimes it's-it's get 4, and I swear to God more often than not it's just milk.
Here they come, here they come. Oh-ho, if she kisses him goodnight, I'm gonna kill myself, I swear. I can't, I can't watch this. Come on, date over! Date over! Uh-oh, here we go, she's going in.
Hey, it's been like three weeks!
You slept with somebody three hours after you thought you broke up. I mean bullets have left guns slower!
Okay.
She's going in. Wait! He's going in! He's going in!! The door's closed! I, I can't see anything but the door closed!!
So it said that by the year 2030, there'll be computers that can carry out the same number of functions as an actual human brain. So theoretically we could download our thoughts and our memories into this computer...
Oh well you're the best. You come here to me.
All right, hold on okay? First thing's first. Okay, now did Ross sit anywhere while he was naked?
...and live forever as a machine!
That's so Janine, you-you-you know what, do you know we're doing right now? You and I, we're interfacing.
I was really upset about Rachel and Paolo, and I think I had too much tequila, and Nora- um, Mrs. Mom- your Bing- was just being nice, y'know, and- But nothing happened, nothing- Ask Joey, Joey, uh, came in-
Yeah, um, I don't know if you noticed, but he had a lot to drink, and you know how he gets when he's drun..uh... I can't do this, I did it, it was me, I'm sorry, I kissed your mom.
What?
You knew about this?
Uh... y'know, knowledge is a tricky thing.
Ah, no Mon, Dad had to buy everyone of your boxes because you ate them all. But ah, y'know I'm sure that's not gonna happen this time, why don't I put you down for three of the mint treasures and just a couple of the Rudolph's.
Mon?
All right, I'll take one box of the mint treasures, just one, and that's it. I-I started gaining weight after I joined the Brown Birds. Remember, how Dad bought all my boxes and I ate them all?
No.
Oh, come on, now you know you want 'em.
Hello. Oh hi, are you on your way ove-. Oh. No, no, I, I understand, I mean a monkey's gotta work. No it, it's no big deal, it' not like I uh, had anything special planned. Yeah OK, OK. OK, OK, bye.
With mealworms.
Yaaahhh. Ahhh, candles. What'dya thinks gonna happen here tonight?
OK, Rachel, why don't you start talking first.
Alright, I feel that this is totally unjustified. She gave me the green light, I did nothing but-. Do you think I can't see you in the TV set?
Yes, I do have a laundry room in my building, um, but there's a.... rat problem. Apparently they're attracted to the dryer sheets, and they're goin' in fine, but they're comin' out all.... fluffy. Anyway, say, sevenish?
Me. Was that not clear? Hey, why don't, um, why don't I just join you both, here?
Don't you have a laundry room in your building?
Sure.
Forget it Joey. I'm with Bob now.
Animal sex, animal sex? So what're you saying, I mean, you're saying that like, there's nothing between us animal at all. I mean there's not even like, uhm, a little animal, not even, not even like, like chipmunk sex?
Oh, hey, if I make you laugh, here's an idea, why don't you invite Paulo over and have a little romp in the sack and I'll just stand in the corner and tell knock-knock jokes.
God, Ross, look, what you and I have is special, all Paolo and I ever had was...
Ok, Ross, try to hear me. Ok, I, hey, I'm not gonna lie to you. Ok, it was good with Paolo.
Knock-knock.
No!! Y'know-y'know don't do me any favours. In fact, where, where's the rest of my stuff?! Huh? Like-like my umm, Hey, this book is mine!! And-and-and, and that T-shirt you sleep in? I'd like that back too. Yes, I do.
It's still a gift! I got it from the gift shop!
Okay, all right, give me the mug! I'll keep the mug.
You know how much I love that T-shirt! You never even where that T-shirt!
I'm just trying to help you, move on.
Look, there are people like Ross who need to shoot for the stars, with his museum, and his papers getting published. Other people are satisfied with staying where they are- I'm telling you, these are the people who never get cancer.
No it's not.
Don't listen to your mother. You're independent, and you always have been! Even when you were a kid... and you were chubby, and you had no friends, you were just fine! And you would read alone in your room, and your puzzles...
...And I read about these women trying to have it all, and I thank God 'Our Little Harmonica' doesn't seem to have that problem.
So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks?
Ok, we were sitting over there playing on the floor and he grabs the table and he pulls himself up. He pulled himself up. Standing man. I'm sorry you guys missed it but I did tape it so it you guys want to see it.
What?
What?
Uhh, we know, he already did it last week.
You can watch our tape if you want.
Well, as much as I'd like to meet Josh and warn him, Emily and I aren't going to be here. All right? I mean, she's going to come by first to say good-bye, and then I've got a whole special evening planned. So I'm sorry, no party.
Yeah, what' going on?
We have to have a surprise Bon Voyage party for Emily. But it's actually for Joshua. Look, he said he's not ready to date, so I had to invite him to a party if I wanted to see him outside of work, and now I have the perfect opportunity to seduce him!
Awwww!
Hello?
And everyone's telling me, you gotta pick a major, you gotta pick a major. So, on a dare, I picked paleontology. And you have no idea what I'm saying, because, let's face it, you're a fetus. You're just happy you don't have gills anymore.
Joey!
That one will.
Look, you don't have to talk to it. You can sing to it if you want.
Oh, please. I am not singing to your stomach, ok?
Uh, okay, yeah, we could do that, but before we head off to the murder capital of the North-East, I was, uh, kinda wanting to run something by you. Y'know how we were, uh, y'know, talking before about, uh, relationships and stuff? Well-
Yeah. You, uh, you want some?
Oh, I would love some. But y'know what? Y'know what? Let's not drink it here. I'm feeling kinda crazy. You wanna go to Newark?
Oh God, Ross, I cannot do this.
Okay, quick and painful.
Pheebs, I have studied evolution my entire adult life. Ok, I can tell you, we have collected fossils from all over the world that actually show the evolution of different species, ok? You can literally see them evolving through time.
How can you not believe in evolution?
Just don't. Look at this funky shirt!
Really? You can actually see it?
You bet. In the U.S., China, Africa, all over.
Okay! Okay! But if she doesn't call, it is definitely over! No, wait. Wait. Unless, eventually, I call her, y'know just to she what's going on, and, and she says she'll call me back, but then she doesn't. Then it's over.
Okay. Good one.
It is not over because she is going to call you and tell you she loves you. And the reason why she couldn't, is because her feelings were so strong, it scared her. Now you go home and wait for her call, she could be calling you from the plane! Come on now go! Go!
Way to be strong, man!
Hey!
So do I. Okay Rach, before anything happens I just want to lay down a couple of ground rules. This is just about tonight. I don't to go through with this if it's going to raise the question of "Us." Okay? I just want this to be about what it is!
Do you want me too?
Yeah, sure?
And um, what-what is that Ross?
The physical act of love.
I was hugging her as a friend. It's not my fault her-her hair got in my face, she's got a lot of it and it smells all-all uh...coconutty. What?! Oh, that doesn't mean I have feelings for Rachel! Maybe it means I have feelings for coconuts!
S-s-smell her hair? What if I did?
Ninety percent of a women's pheromones come out the top of her head! That's why, that's why women are shorter. So that men will fall in love when they hug them! Oh come on Ross, you're a scientist.
Okay, whatever you say. But just be careful, all right? Rachel's not in the same place you are.
If the place you are referring too is being in love, then she is in the same place as me because I am not in that place!
All right, all right. You-you-you know what I'm going to do? I am going to order another pizza and when Caitlin gets here, you-you--I will show how well I flirt. Yeah! I will, I will get her phone number! And not the one on the menu!
What? What-what, what are talking about? It-it worked with you.
Oh! Y'know what? You're right! We meet, you flirted and then bamn nine years later you had me!
I found it!
Ohh! Thank God! Where was it?
What? Wh- hello? The Millners' farm in Connecticut? The Millners, they had this unbelievable farm, they had horses, and, and rabbits that he could chase and it was- it w- .....Oh my God, Chi Chi!
That's funny, that, no, because, uh, our parents actually did, uh, send our dog off to live on a farm.
Uh, Ross.
"So how does it feel knowing you're about to die?"
"Warden, in five minutes my pain will be over. But you'll have to live with the knowledge that you sent an honest man to die."
No, no, I don't wanna put it off, I just, God I just, I spent last year being so unbelievably miserable, ya know, and now, now I'm actually happy. You know, I mean, really happy. I just, I just don't wanna, I don't wanna mess it up, ya know.
OK, now I'm nervous.
Maybe you should put it off.
I know, yeah, sorry.
What, it's not your fault.
Look, this is just a little too familiar, okay? For like, for Like six months before Carol and I spilt up, all I heard was "My friend Susan is so smart. My friend Susan is so funny. My friend Susan is so great."
Turns out them Emily is just crazy about Susan. Yeah, they're going to the theatre together! They're going to dinner! They're going horseback riding!
God, Susan is so fun!
You actually think that something can happen between Emily and Susan?
Hey, they're going to the gym together! Two women! Stretching! Y'know they-they take a steam together! Things get a little playful-didn't you see Personal Best?
Hi! Hi, I'm Ross, you don't know me, but I'm a big, big fan of yours. I mean, Blue Velvet, woo-oo hoo! Um, I was wondering if I could um, maybe buy you a cup of coffee? Or maybe reimburse you for that one?
Rach, are you really gonna let him do this?
Honey, he's about to go hit on Isabella Rosselini. I'm just sorry we don't got popcorn.
Aren't you with that girl over there?
Well, yeah, kinda. Um, but that's okay, see we have an understanding, um, see we each have this list of five famous people, so I'm allowed to sleep with you. No, no, no, it's flattery.
That was the water fountain! Okay?! Anyway, people are writing reports for me, uh pushing back deadlines to meet my schedule, I'm telling you, you get tough with people you can get anything you want. Hey Tribbiani, give me that coffee! Now!
Phoebe! You're note, amazing! Not only did no one touch my sandwich, but people at work are actually afraid of me. Yeah, a guy called me mental! Mental Geller, yeah, I always wanted a cool nickname like that.
Yeah, the best you got in high school was Wet Pants Geller.
God, this was really fun! I've been wondering if you were going to ask me out.
So you uh, still wondering?
No, no, that's funny. But maybe it's time to move on, let it go, y'know? Stop it! Besides, Rachel is going out with Elizabeth's father, so ah, he's much older than she is. Looks like I'm not the only one interested in fossils, huh?
Why? What?
Well, her father pays you for baby-sitting right?
I mean Ross all that does is remind us that you are interested in fossils.
Okay, okay. Uh, well uh, Rachel is going to need to yell sweet nothings in his ear.
Hi, um, Im err, Im Ross Geller, and err ah... ..thats, thats my boy in there, and uh, this is Carol Willick, and this... is Susan Bunch. Susan is um Carols, just, com... ..whos next?
Hi, were the Rostins. Err, Im J.C., and hes Michael, and were having a boy, and a girl.
Good for you. Alrighty, next?
Im sorry, I didnt get... Susan is?
Susan is Carols, Carols, Carols, friend...
No. Man I don't wanna have to have Joey with me every time I wanna descent cup of coffee. Ya know, and I don't wanna spend the rest of my life drinking cappucino with a 'K'. I say you and I go back down there and stand up to those guys.
No.
No?
Alright, hang on a second there Custer.
Yeah really, Ross, have you ever been beaten up before?
Fine! Fine! But this break-up was not all my fault, and she, she says here, "If you accept full responsibility..." Full responsibility! "...I can begin to trust you again. Does that seem like something you can do. Does it?!!"
She wants me to take responsibility for everything that went wrong in our relationship. I mean she goes on for five pages about, about how I was unfaithful to her! WE WERE ON A BREAK!!!!!
Oh my God! If you say that one more time, I'm gonna break up with you!
No?
Look, Ross, you have what you want, you're back with Rachel. If you bring this up now you're gonna wreck the best thing that even happened to you.
So I'm a pimp huh? It's okay! Look, I know that sometimes I can be a pain in the ass, but you just have to talk to me. Tell me if something is bothering you. Okay? And for my part I will do everything I can to keep my annoying habits just .
All right!
All right, buddy!
Well, I see you've had a very productive day. Don't you think the cowboy hat is a little much?
Come on, it's fun!
Dear Mary-Angela. Hi. How's it going. This is the hardest letter I've ever had to write. What the hell's a matter with you? How do you think Joey's going to react when he finds out that you blew off his sister with a letter?
I don't remember. Do you wanna take a walk?
Yeah, I do.
Well, that's the part where you tell him that I moved to France. When actually I'll be in Cuba.
All right, look, look, you've got to do this yourself, okay in person. At least you know her name. You just go to the house and you ask for Mary-Angela, okay, when which ever one she is comes to the door, you take her for a walk, you let her down easy.
Well, it's not for sure but umm, we met this guy in the park who thought Ben was really cute--y'know, which he is--so umm anyhoo, he uh, he gave us his card and told us to bring him down for this commercial he's auditioning.
Guess what? Ben is going to be in a TV commercial!
What are you talking about?!
Whoa! This guy is like the biggest commercial casting director in town! Ben takes one lousy walk in the park and gets an audition!! I mean, way to go Ben! Man! I've been in that park a million times and no one offered me an audition.
I know, it's crazy! We were just pushing Ben on the swings...
You know, I hate to lecture you guys, but it's kinda disgraceful, that a group of well-educated adults and Joey can't name all the states. Did you ever see a map, or one of those round, colorful things called "a globe?" Hmm?
Done! With time a-to-spare.
Oooh that may be a New World's record
Uh, Magellan? You got 46 states.
What? That's impossible.
All right. A room. A man enters, he looks suspicious. That's it? Joey, you're supposed to have five pages done by now! Including an exciting incident! And what is, and what is all this?! The official rulebook of Fireball.
Now, that's trash. Young lady, you can't... Hey! Stop that young lady, she donated trash!
Hey!! The charity's on fire! Help! Oh good! Thank you, I need that. Whoa! What is that?! It's nine o'clock in the morning!
Yeah, that's the uh, game we were playing.
Oh yeah, it's great! See you take a tennis ball, a bowl, and some lighter fluid-Op! Op!
Julie. Julie. That. Oh God. Julie, right. OK, I need to lie down. No, ya know, I'm gonna stand. I'm gonna stand, I'm gonna walk, I'm walkin' and I am standing. OK so you uh, and now wha... and now, now, now you're over me?
China.
Meeting Julie.
Are you over me?
That's, that's Julie. Ju... Julie, Julie. Hi Julie.
Of course! It all adds up! I mean you you're obsessed with her. It's always, "Ross, what are you gonna do about Rachel?" "Ross, why-why are you moving in with Rachel?" "When are you gonna confess your secret marriage to Rachel?" You want her!
Oh...my...God! I-I see what this is! You are in love with Rachel!
What?!!
No!
Uh-oh, saved by the bell. Hello?
Okay, you're in bed. She's over on your side, cuddling. Now you wait for her to drift off, and then you hug her and roll her back over to her side of the bed. And then you rollll a-way. Hug for her! Roll for you.
I'm gonna use the cushion.
Yeah.
Okay, the old hug and roll.
Yep.
Y'know actually it does have a very interesting history. Uh, this street is the first street in the city to have an underground sewer system. Before that sewage and waste would just flow right down the street. Yeah, sometimes ankle deep!
Ah.
But-but this block is like a whole other world.
Smooth.
Excuse me?
Oh what's the big deal?! I wasn't even invited to the ceremony, just the reception. And-and y'know what? If it makes you feel any better, Joan and I will just make an appearance and then, and then we'll-we'll leave early as a sign of protest.
Well yeah, but she doesn't know that. I mean, the last time she saw you-you would've turned one of those little wedding chairs into kindling.
Limited seating! Oh, that is such a lame excuse! That's not the reason she's not inviting me!
Joan?
Yeah, Joan Tedeski my date. She's an assistant professor in the Linguistics department. Tall, very beautiful, and despite what some people say, not broad backed!
Here we go. Y'know, I've-I've never played my stuff for anyone before, so it's important that-that you understand it's about communicating very private emotions. Y'know, umm, you should-you should think of umm, my work as wordless sound poems. That's what I'm...
Okay, guys.
All right! Bring it on, you...
Oh my God! Play!
Boy, that was-that was, umm... terrific.
No, sorry I don't. Tell me why would anyone pay someone to scar their body for life? What if it doesn't come out right Phoebe? Then it's like, I don't know, havin' a bad hair cut all the time. Why's everyone staring at me?
A tattoo? Why, why would you want to do that? Hi.
Hi. Well hey, you don't - you don't think they're kind of cool?
Ross, come sign this birthday card for dad. Rich is gonna be here any minute.
Oooh, Rich is goin' to the party too, huh?
Hmm-Hmm-Hmm. Okay. I, uh, am from Long Island. I-I came to the city for college. Um, I, um, have a 5 year old son and in my spare time I like to read spy novels. But, but, let's talk more about you. Hmm.
Mmm-Unmm.
Come on. I want to know.
So what's really neat. If you sear the stems of the flowers first in a frying pan, your arrangement will look fresh much longer.
Oh my God, Joey, that is such a great tip.
Not that big a deal? It's amazing. Ok, you just reach in there, there's one little maneuver, and bam, a bra right out the sleeve. All right, as far as I'm concerned, there is nothing a guy can do that even comes close. Am I right?
Ohhh... I'm fine.
Would you let it go? It's not that big a deal.
Come on! You guys can pee standing up.
We can? All right, I'm tryin' that.
Yeah! Yeah, Emily always wanted to get married in this beautiful place that her parents got married, but it's going to be torn down, so... I mean, I-I know it's crazy, but everything up 'til now has been so crazy, and I don't know, this just feels right. Y'know?
Yeah.
Well, that's great.
Hey! That's the day after I stop menstruating! This isn't mine.
Hey, Rachel.
I don't believe this. I miss, I miss the first time of everything. I missed, what, the first time he rolled over, the first time he crawled. What else did I miss? Has he spoken yet, is he driving, does he have a favorite liquour?
Uhh, we know, he already did it last week.
You can watch our tape if you want.
Actually, he is getting closer on the talking thing. He can't quite say mama yet, but once he said yumen.
Ooh, I, I'm so sick of missing stuff. Ya know, I want him for more than, than a day, I want him for a whole weekend. No listen , I mean, I feel like-
You damn kids! You ring my bell one more time, I swear to... Ohh, uh Jill. Umm, that-that's just a little game I play with the kids down the hall. Umm, they've really taken a liking to me. Uhh what's-what's-what's the matter?
So you didn't mean any of that?!
No you robot!!
Rachel and I had a really big fight, can I come in? I-I mean I know we're not supposed to see each other anymore and I'm okay with that, it's just that I don't know anybody in the city and I really need somebody to talk to about it.
Of course, what happened?
Look sweetie, I could be the bigger man, I could be the biggest man, I could be a big, huge, giant man, and it still wouldn't make any difference, except that I could pick your Father up and say 'Like me! Like me tiny doctor!'
Look, honey, I have tried to make nice, it doesn't work.
Okay, look, Ross, I realise that my Father is difficult, but that's why you have got to be the bigger man here.
Okay, well can't you just try it one more time Ross? For me? For me?
Rachel one brunch is not gonna solve anything. You gotta face it, okay we're never gonna get along.
Listen, you are hearing one side of the story, okay-and F.Y.I she must've shown Kyle over 30 paint samples before she painted that room! And his response to each one was, "I don't give a tiny rat's ass."
Hi.
So, how are things going with crazy? Has she cooked your rabbit yet?
Yeah well, maybe she should've spent a little less time decorating and a little more time in the bedroom.
Well, I don't think we are gonna have that problem, but maybe that's just because I am not emotionally unavailable!
Okay, okay, I was typing names into the library computer earlier, y'know-y'know for fun, and I typed mine in and guess what came up? My doctoral dissertation! It's here! Yeah, it's right-it's right down here! In the biggest library in the university!
Okay, okay take a guess.
The hot chicks?
Wow that's actually pretty cool.
Oh umm, there's also a book here by a woman named Wendy Bagina. What is that?
Alright. The, uh, the neighbours must be vacuuming. Well, so long as we're here and, uh, not on the subject, I was thinking about, uh, how mad we got at each other before, and, um, I was thinking maybe it was partially because of how we, um...
Yeah, but you were the one who got him back, y'know? You, you were great. ...Hey, we uh, we still have that, uh, that bottle of wine. You in the mood for, uh, something grape?
That'd be good.
Rachel.
Barry?!
Look, Rachel, this is poker. I play to win, alright? In order for me to win, other people have to lose. So if you're gonna play poker with me, don't expect me to be a 'nice guy,' OK? Cause once those cards are dealt...
...Yeah.
Yes, and I get my ya-yas from Ikea. You have to put them together yourself, but they cost a little less.
...Yeah?
I'm not a nice guy.
You think?! God, I, ah, I'm in hell. I mean what, what am I gonna do? Rachel's all like, 'I love you and, and let's work on this.' And all I can think about is, 'What is she gonna do? What is she gonna say?' when I tell her what I did.
Oh my God! Oh my God!
Yeah. We figured when we couldn't find you, you'd gone home to make up with Rachel. Which is probably what you shoulda done. Huh?
Well, before we answer that, I think we should address the more important question. How dumb are you?
What?! Look, we're trying to rebuild a relationship here, right. How am I supposed to do that here, without being totally honest with each other?
Come on, come on. Damnit, damnit, damnit, damnit. This is all your fault. This is supposed to be, like, the greatest day of my life, y'know? My son is being born, and I should be in there, you know, instead of stuck in a closet with you.
Yeah, the Knicks by 10. They suck.
Yeah, they're not so bad.
The woman I love is having a baby today. I've been waiting for this just as much as you have.
No no no, believe me. No one has been waiting for this as much as I have, ok? And you know what the funny thing is? When this day is over, you get to go home with the baby, ok? Where does that leave me?
All right, look, look, you've got to do this yourself, okay in person. At least you know her name. You just go to the house and you ask for Mary-Angela, okay, when which ever one she is comes to the door, you take her for a walk, you let her down easy.
Dear Mary-Angela. Hi. How's it going. This is the hardest letter I've ever had to write. What the hell's a matter with you? How do you think Joey's going to react when he finds out that you blew off his sister with a letter?
Well, that's the part where you tell him that I moved to France. When actually I'll be in Cuba.
What if Mary-Angela comes to the door and I ask for Mary-Angela?
Where in Cuba?
Because! Because, it-it-it's... It'd be like you having this guitar and-and never playing it. Okay, this guitar wants to be played! And-and this bike wants to be ridden and-and if you don't ride it you-you're-you're killing its spirit! The bike is dying.
All right, y'know what? If you are not going to learn how to ride this bike then I'm sorry, I'm just gonna have to take it back.
What?! Why?!
All right. If you care enough to make up that load of crap, okay.
Great! Great! You're making the bike very happy.
Okay, for instance. Let's say, Janice is coming back from a trip and she gives you two options. Option number 1 she'll take a cab home from the airport. Option 2 is you can meet her at baggage claim. Which do you do?
Okay, so you both just know this stuff?
Well you know, after about thirty or forty fights, you kinda catch on.
That's easy, baggage claim.
Wrong! Now you're single. It's actually secret option number three, you meet her at the gate. That way she knows you love her.
Uh, well, don't worry, I'll use the gentle cycle. Ok, um, basically you wanna use one machine for all your whites, a whole nother machine for colors, and a third for your uh, your uh, delicates, and that would be your bras and your under-panty things.
Rach, have you never done this before?
Well, not myself, but I know other people that have. Ok, you caught me. I'm a laundry virgin.
Ok, Well, what about these are white cotton panties. Would they go with whites or delicates?
Uh, that, that, that would be a judgment call.
Postpone it? Emily, do you think Monica realises how much our parents spent on this wedding? Do you my sister's teeny-tiny little brain comprehends that people took time out of their lives to fly thousands of miles to be here, huh? This isn't right.
She said what?
She said, "If I'm not gonna be happy getting married somewhere that we find in a day, well then we should just postpone it."
I realise that people are going to be disappointed. But, I'm sure they'll come back when we can do it right.
I can't ask people to do that? Would you ask people to do that?
It's just, it's, it's me. You, you know I've only been with one woman my whole life and she turned out to be a lesbian. So now I've got myself all psyched out, you know, and it's become, like this, this thing and I. . . Well, you just must think I'm weird.
No, no, she's great and it's not like we haven't done anything. I mean, uh, uh, we, we do plenty of other stuff, lot's of other stuff, like uhh. . .
No, no no no, don't need to know the details.
No, no, no, no I don't think it's weird, I think, I think umm, in fact, in fact you know what I think?
What?
We got a head, we got shoulders, we got arms, we got, oh, look at the little fingers, oh, and a chest, and a stomach. It's a boy, definitely a boy! All right! Ok, legs, knees, and feet. Oh, oh. He's here. He's a person.
Hello! Oh, sorry.
What do you see? What do you see?
Oh, look at that.
What does he look like?
Right, you're not even getting your honeymoon, God.. No, no, although, Aruba, this time of year... talk about your- -big lizards... Anyway, if you don't feel like being alone tonight, Joey and Chandler are coming over to help me put together my new furniture.
So Rachel, what're you, uh... what're you up to tonight?
Well, I was kinda supposed to be headed for Aruba on my honeymoon, so nothing!
Yes, and we're very excited about it.
Well actually thanks, but I think I'm just gonna hang out here tonight. It's been kinda a long day.
No, you've heard my practice. Okay? Just-just give me a chance to perform for you and then decide whatever you want. And I'm not going to tell you what song I'm gonna play either. But uh, let's just say when it's over I'll bet there will be a we bit o' celebration.
Come on that's not fair! I mean you haven't even heard me play!
We have heard you play.
So, the essence of the character is rooted in her confidence. So, when Jessica enters a room for instance, she owns everything and every person in that room. You try.
Okay! All right!
Okay, hey, that's okay with me. Two down and I have exactly twelve minutes.... Wha, my watch stopped. My watch. Okay, see, the, the dinosaur tail isn't going around any more. What time is it? It's 7:33, I have seven minutes. I have seven minutes!!
What are you supporting?
Duh!! Christmas!
Okay, Pheebs, quick, what shoes should I wear? The black or the purple?
Just, just, just pick one!
Anyway, suddenly I'm down field, and I realise that I'm the one who's supposed to catch him, right? Only I know there is no way I'm gonna get there in time, so I am running, and running, and that, that is when I woke up. See I, I am so not ready to be a father.
What are you crazy? That's a baby!
He should take the sack?
Hey, you're gonna be fine. You're one of the most caring, most responsible men in North America. You're gonna make a great dad.
Yeah, Ross. You and the baby just need better blocking.
Well, not right now. Okay look, Monica came here for some memories and damnit, we're gonna give her some! Okay, grab...grab some empty boxes. Okay? We'll-we'll take stuff from mine and whatever we can pass off as hers we'll-we'll put 'em in their.
Dad, dad I don't want to hear about it.
Really?
Great!
Like uh y'know like this! This! She-she could've made this!
Okay! Okay. Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby.
...And I read about these women trying to have it all, and I thank God 'Our Little Harmonica' doesn't seem to have that problem.
So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks?
And you knew about this?!
Your folks are really that bad, huh?
It is. Eventually, it kind of... burns out. But hopefully, what you're left with is trust, and security, and... well, in the case of my ex-wife, lesbianism. So, you know, for all of those people who miss out on that passion... thing, there's all that other good stuff.
Probably. But you know, I'll tell you something. Passion is way overrated.
Yeah right.
OK.
But, um... I don't think that's going to be you.
No. I... I wanted to be with you. I don't know, I feel like lately, I feel like you're slipping away from me, y'know. With this new job, and all these new people, and you've got this whole other life going on. I-I-I know it's dumb, but I hate that I'm not a part of it.
No-no-no, a bunch of out of control jackets take over an island.
Y'know if what I do is so lame, then why did you insist on coming with me this morning? Huh? Was it so I just wouldn't go with Mark?
It's not dumb. But, maybe it's okay that you're not a part of it. Y'know what I mean? I mean it's like, I-I-I like that you're not involved in that part of my life.
That's a little clearer.
Yeah. You see my-my sister makes these amazing turkey sandwiches. Her secret is, she puts a, an extra slice of gravy soaked bread in the middle; I call it the Moist Maker. Anyway, I-I put my sandwich in the fridge over here...
Oh no, you-you don't understand. Ugh, this is so silly. Umm, this is all because of a sandwich.
A sandwich?
Oh, you know what?
What?
Hey Rach. I, uh, got you a little present. . . I'll open it. It's a Slinky! Remember, huh. Walks down stairs, alone or in pairs, everyone knows it's. . . just a big spring. Alright, you still mad at me becuase of the whole. . .
Hey guys.
Hey.
Horrible and degrading list of reasons not to be with me?
How 'bout from now on we just call it the 'unfortunate incident'? Hey Gunther, you got stairs in your place?
All right, keep going. We are phasing the accent out, phasing it out. So without out re-testing the results in the laboratory the team would never have identified the initial errors in their carbon dating analysis . Were there any questions at this point? Yes.
Yes, this Russell, Ross's divorce lawyer, just tell him that since I haven't heard from him, I assume he's decided to give the marriage a try.
Ross got married again-Nooooooo!!!!!!!!!
What's happening to your accent?
Come again? What's-what's this nonsense? All right, I'm-I'm not English. I'm from Long Island. I was really nervous and the accent just uh, just came out. I'm sorry. So, if we could just get back to the lecture. Umm, were there any questions? About paleontology. All right, look I was just trying to make a good first impression. Obviously, I screwed up. But what you guys think of me is really important because I'm-I'm hoping to get a permanent job here. So if you just give me another chance to make a good impression...
No, a car backfired, but I thought somebody was taking a shot at me. And Rach, I...I survived! And I was filled with this-this great respect for life. Y'know? I-I want to experience every moment. I want to seize every opportunity. I-I am seeing everything so-so clearly now.
And somebody took a shot at me!
Really?!
Because a car backfired?
Okay, why are you here?
Ohh, I gotta go to the flower store! Check it out, no one will tell me where Emily is, so I'm gonna send 72 long-stem, red roses to Emily's parent's house, one for each day that I've known and loved her. That oughta get her talking to me again.
Oh, thanks. Oh, you're the best.
Oh no, you're the best.
Oh, Ross, when you make out card; be sure to make it out to, EM-I-LY.
Rach, that's great! It's so good that you had a good time in Greece!
Well, but aren't you pissed at him?! I mean this guy abandoned you! I gotta tell you if this were me, this guy would be in some serious physical danger! I mean I-I-I'd walk in there and I'd be like, "Yo, dad! You and me outside right now!" I kinda scared myself.
Ooh, Pheebs, what are you gonna say? Are you gonna tell him who you are?
Umm, no, not at first 'cause I-I don't want to freak him out
Well, at least you scared someone.
Y'know it's funny, you'd think I'd be angry. I mean, you'd think I'd wanna rip his tiny little head off. Fortunately, I'm past it.
What, now you're not even taking to me? Look Rachel, I-I'm sorry, okay, I'm sorry, I was out of my mind. I thought I'd lost you, I didn't know what to do. Come on! Come on, how insane must I have been to do something like this? Huh? I-I don't cheat right, I, that's not me, I'm not Joey!
Well y'know, I've been walking the same way since high school. Y'know, y'know how some guys they walk into a room and everybody takes notice. I think I need a 'take notice' walk.
Are you actually saying these words?
Whoa-ho-ho! Yeah, okay.
Hey. It's three in the morning. They don't know that I've come home yet. You notice how neither one of them are wondering where I am.
So, I just finished this fascinating book. By the year 2030, there'll be computers that can carry out the same amount of functions as an actual human brain. So theoretically you could download your thoughts and memories into this computer and-and-and live forever as a machine.
Now wait a minute. You just took all the words!
Uh-huh. You've met your match Rachel Green.
And I just realized I can sleep with my eyes open.
Hey!
Marcel. Bring me the rice, c'mon. Bring me the rice, c'mon. Good boy. Good boy. C'mere, gimme the rice. Thank you, good boy. Well, I see he's finally mastered the difference between 'bring me the' and 'pee in the'. 'Bring me the' and- Rach?
Mindy, my maid of. Oh!
That's Mindy? Wow, she is pretty. Lucky. To have had a friend like you.
What?
Hi.
Well, I-I want to give her another chance, y'know? She lives so close. And, at the end of the date, the other time, she-she said something that was-if she was kidding was very funny. On the other hand, if she wasn't kidding, she's not fun, she's stupid, and kind of a racist.
Not her. Yeah, this is someone else I meet, and I-I can't decide between the two of them. Y'know the one from Poughkeepsie, even though she's a two hour train ride away, is really pretty, really smart, and-and a lot of fun. But this other girl, well, she lives right uptown. Y'know she's, well she's-she's just as pretty, I guess she's smart, she's not fun.
If she's no fun, why do you want to date her at all?
Hey!
Hey!
I'm just sayin' if dogs do experience jet lag, then, because of the whole um, seven dog years to one human year thing, then, when a dog flies from New York to Los Angeles, he doesn't just lose three hours, he loses like a week and a half.
Oh, hi, Ross. Yeah. There's someone I want you to say hi to. He just happened to call.
Hi, Ross. Yes, it's me. How did you know?
That's funny. Who are they?
The blond woman is my ex-wife, and the woman touching her is her... close, personal friend.
Well, uh, for your information, there's a woman at the museum, who's curator of moths and other... uh... winged things... who's, uh, let it be known that she is drawn to me much like a... well, you know. But so far I've been keeping her at bay, but, uh, if this is the deal...
Hey, I didn't know we were, uh, seeing other people.
Well, we're not seeing each other, so....
Well, yeah, this is the deal.
OK, well, um, have a nice evening.
Hey! There are some men who will do whatever it takes to make their marriage work! Okay? There are some men who will stand by and-and watch as their wives engage in-in what only can be described as a twosome with some-some woman she barely knows from the gym!
Look I-I don't know what's going on with you and your husband and what is hopefully an adult dog walker, look can I just say not all men are like that.
Oh.
Who are these men?
Men. I guy I know.
Okay, each team will answer ten questions. The first team that answers the most questions wins. Okay, the categories are, Fears and Pet Peeves, Ancient History, Literature, and It's All Relative. Now, the coin toss to see who goes first. Okay, somebody call it this time.
The test is ready.
Yeah! Yes!
Oh yeah!
Tails!
... and that's the story of the dreidle. Now, some people trace the Christmas tree back to the Egyptians, who used to bring green palm branches into their huts on the shortest day of the year, symbolising life's triumph over death. And that was like 4000 years ago.
Oh, here.
See now it feels like Christmas!
So, pretty much around the same time that you started telling this story.
Hey you guys.
Ok, ok, number one: The way you cry at game shows. Number two: how much you love your friends. Number three: the way you play with your hair when you're nervous. Number four: how brave you are for starting your life over. Number five: how great you are with Ben.
I just wanna read something. It's your pro list.
Not interested.
Number six: the way you smell.
Hey, Ross! What are you doin'?
Well, we're applying to a lot of them. Naturally our first choice would be one of the bigger state zoos, y'know, like, uh, San Diego... right? But that might just be a pipe dream, because, y'know, he's out of state. Uh, my vet, uh, knows someone at Miami, so that's a possibility.
How do you get a monkey into a zoo?
I know that one! ...No, that's Popes into a Volkswagen.
Yeah, but that's like two blocks away from the beach. I mean, it's a total party zoo.
Hey. We found her, we found the girl.
Okay-okay! Two very good points, look I've known you both a long time, and I've never seen either of you one/millionth as happy as you've been since you've got together. Do you really want to throw that all away over a room? That is so silly. Now wh-what is more important, love or silliness?
Well, apparently not, and I can't just stand by and watch two people I care about very much be hurt over something that is so silly. I mean, enough of the silliness!
Well, why don't you tell her to stop being silly!
Well, we are fond of the silliness, but we also have a soft spot for the love.
Love is the best medicine.
You know what I don't care. The only person I cared about getting dressed, is the one person that says she's not even gonna go. Look Rach, I'm sorry. Okay. Look, I-I wa, I was a jerk. I'm sorry I yelled. I want you there, I need you there. Look, what, what can I do that can show you how much, how much I want you to be there.
Jeez, what a baby.
Yeah, Ross, way to ruin it. I was just going to get dressed.
You could drink the fat.
Hi, welcome, to an adult conversation.
No look I wasn''t right, that's what I came here to tell you. I was totally hung up on, on my own stuff. Listen, I'm someone who needs the whole security thing, ya know. To know exactly where my next paycheck is coming from buy you, you don't need that and that's amazing to me. I could never do what you do Joey.
Oh my God, what's goin' on?
They're takin all my stuff back. I guess you were right.
Thanks Ross.
Yeah. And you should hold out for something bigger. I can't tell you how much respect I have for you not going to that stupid cab driver audition.
...once you know the stories, it's not that bad. First marriage, wife's hidden sexuality, not my fault. Second marriage, said the wrong name at the altar, a little my fault. Third marriage, well they really shouldn't allow you to get married when you're that drunk and have writing all over your face, Nevada's fault.
Ohh! This is so exciting! Oh God... Come and knock on my door...
We'll be waiting for you...
Okay, so what do you think ladies? Who wouldn't be interested? Who wouldn't want to date him?
Well the divorces don't bother me, I'd date him. But, not while he's still married.
Good evening, sir. My name is Ross Geller. I'm one of the people who applied for the apartment. And I-I realize that the competition is fierce but-I'm sorry. I, I can't help but notice you're naked and I applaud you. Man, I wish I was naked. I mean, this-this looks so great. That is how God intended it.
God, they thought they can mess with us! They're trying to mess with us?! They don't know that we know they know we know! Joey, you can't say anything!
I couldn't even if I wanted too.
All right. All right! If he wants a date? He's gonna get a date. All right, I'm gonna go in.
All right. Be sexy.
Look, just because some idiot drew on your face doesn't mean you shouldn't have any fun! Okay? And besides, hey-hey-hey no one is even gonna look at you. Okay? This is Vegas! Hello! There are tons of other freaks here! There are tons...of...freaks here. No other. No. Come on! No one will notice, I swear!
Oh, come on! Rach, it's-it's not that bad.
Ross, I am a human doodle!!
Okay, there was some staring and pointing.
Okay, I need a, I need a drink!
Uh-uh-Wow! Uh, I thought you guys were just like making jokes, I had no idea. What you know what? You guys are wrong. Uh yes, there is a chronological age difference but I never notice it. You know why? Because she is very mature. Besides, it doesn't really matter to me what you guys think. I mean, I'm the one dating Elizabeth, not you!
Wait a minute, does-does everyone feel this way?
Yeah! Yeah, sort of. I'm sorry.
That's not what she said last night.
See? Now, he could date her.
No no, you're uh, you're my lobster. See um, lobsters, uhh, in the tank when, when they're old, uhh, they get with, uhh, they walk around holding the claws. In the tank, ya know, with, with the holding and. . . Uhh, Phoebs you wanna help me out with the, the whole lobster thing?
Uh, uh, well you're, umm, you're my lobster.
OK, you know what, are, are you being like, the blind date guy again?
Do the claws again.
Rach. OK, forget, forget the lobsters OK. We're, let's talk, what about us?
You deserve to be with someone who appreciates you, and who gets how funny and sweet and amazing, and adorable, and sexy you are, you know? Someone who wakes up every morning thinking "Oh my god, I'm with Rachel". You know, someone who makes you feel good, the way I am with Julie. Was there a second of all?
Well, then, I think, I think the guy is scum. I hate him. I mean I actuallyI-I physically hate him. I always have. You are way too good to be with a guy like that.
Really?
No, I think that was the whole all.
Okay. Okay. Okay.
Yeah, that way I figure, ya know, we'll be far enough away from our parents that we don't have to see them all the time but close enough that they can come over and babysit whenever we want. And yes, I know, the taxes are a little higher than, let's say, Nassau county but the school system's supposedly great.
Well, we won't wanna raise kids in the city so we'll probably move to uh, Scarsdale.
Uh-huh.
Wow. Wow, that's great. Great. Ok, wow, you know what.
Huh?
Come on. These people'll scooch down. You guys'll scooch, won't you? Let's try scooching! Come on. Come on. Uh, Kristen Riggs, this is Carol Willick. Carol, Kristin. Uh, Carol teaches sixth grade. And, Kristin, Kristin... ...does something that, funnily enough, wasn't even her major!
Are you sure? Great. Carol? Wanna come over and join us?
Oh, no no no. I'm fine. I'm fine.
What do we got there?
A piece of something: boxer shorts, greeting cards, and what looks like a half-charred pictureWow, that guy's hairier than the Chief!
Ugh. Well, we're just gonna have to jump. Yeah. Now, we're gonna have to make sure to land to the right of that patch of ice, okay? Not hit the dumpster on the other side and uh, and try to avoid that-that weird brownish red stuff in the middle. So, when you get down there...you go up to the roof and you let me in.
Okay get your coat! Oh! When did you unhook this? Nice work!
All right, it won't go down any further. It's stuck.
Oh whoa-whoa wait a minute! I have to do it?!
Yeah! Oh yeah, you'll be fine! It-it'll be uh, just like bungy jumping. Y'know? But instead of bouncing back up you-you won't.
Oh, is it? Is it? Look, when Monica and I were kids, we had a dog named Rover. And, uh, one day, my dad decides, he doesn't like dogs. So Monica and her friend...Phyllis...take away the dog. And that was the last time we ever saw him. Don't you see? This is just like that. Only with a few details changed.
Because you sent away the dog!
This is ridiculous.
Okay, I'm in my sweat pants. Bring on the food! What's the matter?
Monica's all upset, because I sent Clunkers away.
Oh look, I can't believe this. Look, homo-habilus hasn't even learned how to use tools yet and they've got him here wi, with clay pots. Why don't, why don't they just give him a microwave? I'm sorry, I'm sorry this is taking so long, ya know, I, I, it's just it's longer than I expected, we will have dinner.
Woah, woah, woah australopithicus isn't supposed to be in that display. No. No. No, n, homo-habilus was erect, australopithicus was never fully erect.
Well maybe he was nervous.
It's OK, it's fine.
KARL!
Yeah, it was, but...I get home, ok, and I see Julie's saline solution on my night table. And I'm thinking to myself, oh my god, what the hell am I doing? I mean, here I am, I am with Julie, this incredible, great woman, who I care about and who cares about me, and I'm like, what, am I just gonna throw all that away?
That, that is funny. That is painfully funny. No, wait. Wait, yeah, that's just painful
Wait a minute. I thought last night was great.
You got all that from saline solution?
We are talking about Rachel here. You and Rachel.
Oh, well, I, I guess it musta been the day after you were born. We were in the hospital room, your mother was asleep, and they brought you in and gave you to me. You were this ugly little red thing, and all of a sudden you grabbed my finger with your whole fist. And you squeezed it, so tight. And that's when I knew.
'Cause there's time to make up for that. We can do stuff together. You always wanted to go to that Colonial Williamsburg. How 'bout we do that?
Thanks, Dad, really, I ju... you know, I just, I just needed to know, um... when did you start to feel like a father?
So you don't wanna go to Williamsburg?
No, we can go to Williamsburg.
Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN...
Mm.
So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped?
Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated?
Got me.
Hello! What's this? Oh right its that girl's phone number. Yeah-yeah, there it is, just a phone number a really hot girl gave me. It's no big deal, I mean it is her home phone number, but... Whoa! Whoa-whoops, I almost lost this baby! Yeah, the lovely Amanda gives me her number and I-I go and drop it.
Okay, we'll give a call if anything comes up.
Great! Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Rachel?
And this girl is making eyes at Chandler, okay? So after awhile he-he goes over to her and uh, after a minute or two, I see them kissing. Now, I know what you're thinking, Chandler's not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out with girls, and you're right, Chandler's not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out with...girls.
Well, Chandler and I are in a bar...
Did you not hear me say, "Du-ude?!"
You kissed a guy?!! Oh my God.
In my defense, it was dark and he was a very pretty guy.
Say something clever! Okay, doesn't have to be clever, it just has to be words. Say some words. Any words will do. Oh my God! This is the longest that anyone has not talked ever! There is nothing you can say to make this worse!! So just say something!! I-I, I uh haven't had sex in a very long time. Yeah, you really shouldn't have said anything.
She's your cousin. She's your cousin! If she knew what was going on in your head she'd think you were sick! Or would she? Let's back up a second. She was the one who suggested opening a bottle of wine. She was the one who turned down the lights. She was the one that wanted to rent Logan's Run, the sexiest movie ever. Oh, I know that look. Forget it. I want it. She wants it. I'm going in.
Hey! What the hell are you doing?!
Phoebe! Rachel! It's Monica! I wonder what you could possibly need me for on such short notice! Oh.
Oh Monica, we are so sorry.
Okay, the other night I was leaving the museum just as 'Laser Floyd' was letting out of the planetarium, without even trying I sold 50 boxes! That's when it occurred to me, the key to my success, 'The Munchies.' So I ah, started hitting the new dorms around midnight. I am selling cookies by the case. They call me 'Cookie Dude!'
Check this out. Five hundred and seventeen boxes!
Oh my God, how did you do that?
Okay, stop what you're doing, I need envelope stuffers, I need stamp lickers.....
Well hey, who did these resumes for ya?
Ross, uh and uh, I'd just like to say that it did take a lot of courage for Rachel to come here tonight. And, uh, for the record she did not run out on Barry because she had syphilis. What are you doing I'm serious. Uh, the reason she walked out on, on Barry is simply that she didn't love him, which incidentally worked out pretty well for me Cheers.
Most of you don't know me, I'm Rachel's boyfriend.
Oh dear God.
She you in the parking lot.
No, Rach!
Okay, come on! Daddy needs a new pair of electromagnetic microscopes for the Prehistoric Forensics Department! Okay. Take Pinky Tuscadero up to Inspiration Point, collect three cool points!! Yeah! Which gives me five, and let's see who is gonna lose their clothes. Ummmm, I think I pick our strip poker sponsor Mr. Joey Tribianni.
Okay, Fonzy gives you two thumbs up, collect two cool points. Yeah.
Monica, if you get five cool points, you get to make somebody take off one item of clothing. It hasn't happened yet, but we're all very excited.
Woo-hooooo!!!!
All right, relax. It's just a shoe.
Yes, hello. I have a question. Umm, I used your pen to draw on my friend's face. A beard and a moustache. Thank you. No, she didn't think so. I know it's like anyway, umm well make-up didn't cover it and we've tried everything to get it off and nothing's worked. What-what do we do? Yeah. Uh-huh. Yeah. Oh! Okay. Okay, thank you! Yeah, it's not coming off.
Very busy.
Right! Okay.
What?! What else did he say?
Umm, he said he thought I was funny. So... Okay, look-look umm, let's just go downstairs, we'll have some fun, and you will forget all about it.
Y'know what? I-I'm not even gonna talk about this. Okay? This little thing is over. I know you have a girlfriend! Okay--Yeah! And I know about the other professors! How do you think that makes me feel Ned?! You used me! You don't love me and you never did! Ah Professor Winston, Professor Fredrickson, I'll be right with you. Don't make this worse and I'll give you a C. Shall we?
'Cause I know what you're trying to pull here. Okay? It's not gonna work.
I'm not trying to pull anything. Look I love you dude.
Rach?
I'll be out in a second.
Yeah, pants, what, what an idea. Or better yet, um, how 'bout you go without any pants. Look, I don't know what you're trying to do to me, but just get your butt in there and pick out any shoes that fit your feet, okay. No, no I don't care if they match. I don't care if they make your ankles or your knees or your earlobes look fat. Okay.
Okay, okay, okay, the black. But, oh, do you have black, with the little strappys?
Yeahh, but, but those really go better with pants. Maybe I should wear pants?
But I...
No, no, no just do it. Go in there and pick something out so we can go.
Hey, it'll grow back, right? And she-she's really fun, and she's cool, and-and I'm finally moving on. Y'know? I mean getting over Rachel was so , y'know? Y'know, and I'm finally feeling sane again. And now if I go up there, and-and I kiss her, and, Gooood I wanna kiss her, and-and-and it doesn't work out, right? Do I really wanna put myself through that again?
Okey-dokey!
There is not one hair on that head.
So let me get this straight. If you go with Bonnie tonight, you're doing the smart, healthy thing and moving on.
Yeah.
Unreasonable? How about we have this conversation when one of you guys gets married! You have no idea what it takes to make a marriage work! All right, it's about compromise! Do you always like it? No! Do you do it? Yes! Because it's not all laughing, happy, candy in the sky, drinking coffee at Central Perk all the time! It's real life, okay? It's what grown-ups do!
Look, we just think that maybe she's being a little unreasonable.
Yes! Yes! Unreasonable!
I think he's right. You guys hang out at the coffeehouse way too much.
God, I feel so guilty about Ross.
Okay! You guys are getting married tomorrow and-and I couldn't be more thrilled for both of you, but as Monica's older brother I-I have to tell you this. If you ever hurt my little sister, if you ever cause her any unhappiness of any kind, I will hunt you down, and kick your ass! What? I'm-I'm-I'm serious! Come-Hey! Dude! Stop it! Okay? I'm-I'm not kidding here!
Nope.
Do I still call you Ross?
Hey, I hear what your saying, okay? And, thanks for the warning.
No problem.
Not her. Yeah, this is someone else I meet, and I-I can't decide between the two of them. Y'know the one from Poughkeepsie, even though she's a two hour train ride away, is really pretty, really smart, and-and a lot of fun. But this other girl, well, she lives right uptown. Y'know she's, well she's-she's just as pretty, I guess she's smart, she's not fun.
You know that girl I told you about who lives up in Poughkeepsie?
Yeah.
If she's no fun, why do you want to date her at all?
Well, I-I want to give her another chance, y'know? She lives so close. And, at the end of the date, the other time, she-she said something that was-if she was kidding was very funny. On the other hand, if she wasn't kidding, she's not fun, she's stupid, and kind of a racist.
Oh my God! That's Rachel naked! I can't look at that! I am looking at this. Okay, vivid colors, expressive brush strokes-Unless she wants me to be looking at that. She knows I'm home. She knows I can see her. What kind of game is she playing? I think maybe someone's lonely tonight. Oh-ho, Dr. Geller! Stop it! You're being silly! Or, am I?
Okay, London 1...
Oh! Look what happened! {Don't get your hopes up guys, we only get to see her from the back or from the neck up. Its times like these I wish that the networks would broadcast some nudity other than Denis Franz's butt.} Huh, check me out! I'm in my kitchen...naked! I'm picking up an orange. I'm naked! Lighting the candles, naked, and carefully.
Love to love ya baby! Ow! Love to love ya baby! Ow! Love to love ya, baby! Darnit! Ugh.
Hey.
Okay, umm I want you to know that I have never done anything like this before. I mean, I mean I've been in um, relationships in general, uh but I have never done it with a student-I mean I not-not it! I mean, I mean I don't-We haven't done it. Uh, I mean, I mean, we've-we've-we've done stuff. Okay, okay, a joke, a joke-lighten the mood. Umm, two guys go into a bar. One of them is Irish.
This is-you-
1 minute 50 seconds.
I'm Irish.
And the Irish guy wins the joke!
I don't know, I don't get, I don't get it, I mean, wh, wh, two months ago Rachel and I were like, this close. Right now, what, I'm takin messages from guys she, she meets at the movies? I mean this, this Casey should be takin' down my messages, ya know, or, or, Rachel and I should be together and, and we should get some kind of me, message service.
Oh really? What uh, what does he want with her?
Well, I'm guessing he wants to do a little dance. . . ya know, make a little love. . . well pretty much get down tonight.
Hang in there, it's gonna happen.
Wha, OK, now how do you know that?
Yeah, i-it's for the museum. Someone found a bone, we want the bone, but they don't want us to have the bone, so I'm going over there to try to persuade them to give us the boit'sit's a whole big bone thing. Anyway, I'm gonna be gone for like, uh... like a week, so, uh, if you wanna reach me, y-you can't. So here's my itinerary . Um... here's a picture of me...
Jeez, you say one thing, and...
You're going to China?
Oh, let me see!
: Could you take it to Carol's every now and then, and show it to Ben, just so he doesn't forget me?
Marcel, c'mere, c'mere. Well buddy, this is it. There's just a coupla things I want to say. I'm really gonna miss you, and I'm never gonna forget about you. You've been more than just a pet to me, you've been more like a be- Okay, Marcel, please, could you leave my leg alone? Could you just stop humping me for two seconds?! Marcel, would- okay, just take him away. Just take him.
Uh, if you guys don't mind, I'd like to take a moment, just me and him.
Oh, sure. Sure, absolutely.
Oh, that I were a glove upon that hand, that I might... touch thy cheek...
That's fine, thank you.
Okay, well here we are. Now we're in a tough spot again, Rach. What do you want to do? How do you want to handle it? Huh? Do you wanna fight for us? Or, do you wanna bail? Look, I, I did a terrible, stupid, stupid thing. Okay? And I'm sorry, I wish I could take it back, but I can't. I just can't see us throwing away something we know is so damn good. Rachel, I love you so much.
That's what?!
That is neither here nor there.
No Ross!! Don't! You can't just kiss me and think you're gonna make it all go away, okay? It doesn't work that way. It doesn't just make it better. Okay?
Okay, okay, okay.
Dad...dad, please! As I was saying umm, I'm Dr. Ross Geller. Uhh, and I'm the best man. And uh, this marriage is doubly special for me umm, because not only is the groom my best friend but uh, the bride is my little sister. And, she's the greatest sister a guy could ask for. So if you'd all please join me in raising a glass to the, the couple we're here to celebrate. To the Bings.
Can I have everyone's attention please? I'm uh; I'm Ross Geller.
Doctor Ross Geller.
To the Bings!
All right, I'm gonna go steam my wedding dress okay? Who wants the responsibility of making sure nothing happens to it?
Yeah, I know, so what? I mean, who's-who's to say? Does that me we-we can't do it? Look, huh, I was with Carol for four years before we got married and I wound up divorced from a pregnant lesbian. I mean, this, this makes sense for us. Come on! I mean, on our first date we ended up spending the whole weekend in Vermont! I mean, last night I got my ear pierced! Me! This feels right. Doesn't it?
No! No! I'm not! It's-it's-it's perfect! I mean it's better than you just-just moving here, 'cause it's us together forever, and that's-that's what I want.
We've only known each other for six weeks!
My parents are going to be really mad.
Is that-are you saying yes? Is that yes?
Uh-huh, Carol, so were we. All right, just-just imagine for a moment, Susan meets someone and-and they really hit it off. Y'know? Say-say they're coming back from the theatre, and they-they stop at a pub for a couple of drinks, they're laughing, y'know, someone innocently touches someone else... There's electricity, it's new. It's exciting. Are you telling me there isn't even the slightest possibility of something happening?
Am I?!
I can't speak for Emily, but Susan is in a loving, committed relationship.
Maybe.
OH MY GOD!! I didn't really believe it until you just said it!!
She's your cousin. She's your cousin! If she knew what was going on in your head she'd think you were sick! Or would she? Let's back up a second. She was the one who suggested opening a bottle of wine. She was the one who turned down the lights. She was the one that wanted to rent Logan's Run, the sexiest movie ever. Oh, I know that look. Forget it. I want it. She wants it. I'm going in.
What?! Which one?!
The Silly Putty! It's not so silly anymore!
Hey! What the hell are you doing?!
Say something clever! Okay, doesn't have to be clever, it just has to be words. Say some words. Any words will do. Oh my God! This is the longest that anyone has not talked ever! There is nothing you can say to make this worse!! So just say something!! I-I, I uh haven't had sex in a very long time. Yeah, you really shouldn't have said anything.
...so then President Steve told everyone that I was a cheapskate, and now the whole building hates me! A little kid spit on my knee! Y'know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna throw a party. That's right. For everyone in the building, and I'm gonna sit them down and explain to them, I am not a bad guy. I am not a cheap guy! I'm just a guy who-who stands up for what he believes in. A man with principles.
Ugh, can you believe that guy!
Yeah. I really like his glasses.
Sounds like a fun party.
Hmm. Look, Ross, if you want your neighbors to like you, why don't you just pay the hundred bucks? The party's gonna cost you way more than that.
Now, hold on! Hold on! Look, look, your daughter and I are supposed to leave tonight for our honeymoon, now-now you-you tell her that I'm gonna be at that airport and I hope that she'll be there too! Oh yeah, I said Rachel's name, but it didn't mean anything, Okay? She's-she's just a friend and that's all! That's all! Now just tell Emily that I love her and that I can't imagine spending my life with anyone else. Please, promise me that you'll tell her that.
Hey-hey, you guys oh hurry up, get some, there's a whole cart outside...
Goodbye Geller.
All right, I'll tell her. Come on bugger face!
Call me.
Y'know, we work in a museum of natural history, and yet there is something unnatural about the way we eat lunch. Now, I look around this cafeteria, and y'know what I see, I see-I see division. Division, between people in white coats and people in blue blazers, and I ask myself, "My God why?!" Now, I say we shed these-these coats that separate us, and we get to know the people underneath. I'm Ross! I'm divorced, and I have a kid!
Thank you, Dr. Phillips, but I'm having my lunch at this table, here in the middle. I'm having lunch right here, with my good friend Joey, if he'll sit with me.
I will sit with you Dr. Geller.
I'm Joey! I'm an actor! I don't know squat about dinosaurs!
I'm Ted, and I just moved here a month ago, and New York really scares me.
Come again? What's-what's this nonsense? All right, I'm-I'm not English. I'm from Long Island. I was really nervous and the accent just uh, just came out. I'm sorry. So, if we could just get back to the lecture. Umm, were there any questions? About paleontology. All right, look I was just trying to make a good first impression. Obviously, I screwed up. But what you guys think of me is really important because I'm-I'm hoping to get a permanent job here. So if you just give me another chance to make a good impression...
All right, keep going. We are phasing the accent out, phasing it out. So without out re-testing the results in the laboratory the team would never have identified the initial errors in their carbon dating analysis . Were there any questions at this point? Yes.
What's happening to your accent?
Ross!! Are you crazy?! I am still your wife!! What, were you just never gonna tell me?!! What the hell is wrong with you?!!!! Ugh, I could just kill you!!!!
Well, hello Rachel!
Free cats do that too, y'know. {Which reminds me, if I might get a little political here, support your local animal shelter. Pet shops are not the place to buy dogs and cats from, you get a much better deal from the shelter, plus they probably won't die on you in a week and a half. If you want a leash, go to the pet shop. If you want the dog for that leash, go to the shelter and save it's life. Now back to regularly scheduled programming.}
It's not a cat!
All right listen ball boys! My grandmother had one of these when I was a little girl and it was the sweetest thing! I mean it was so cute, it would sit in my lap and purr all day long, and I would drag a shoestring on the ground and he would chase it!
It's not a cat!
Ugh! Look you guys, I'm really excited about this! Okay? I don't care what you think! I'm gonna go set up a little litter box for Mrs. Whiskerson. Well, what am I gonna call her? Fluffy?!
Well, I don't know what else to do. I mean, I either keep my wife and lose one of my-my-my best friends or I keep my friend and get divorced the second time before I'm 30! So-so if anyone has-has a better suggestion, let's hear it! 'Cause I-I got nothing! All right, don't be shy, any suggestion will do. Okay then. Here we go. Magic 8 Ball, should I never see Rachel again? Ask again later. Later is not good enough. Ask again later. What the hell! This is broken! It-it is broken!
A Magic Eight ball?! You can't be serious, you can't make this decision with a toy!
Ooh, it's not a toy.
All right, let me see. Will Chandler have sex tonight? Don't count on it. Seems like it works to me.
PBS Telethon.
No, it's just...you know the whole "getting on with your life" thing. Well, do I have to? I mean, I'm sitting here with this cute woman, and, and, and she's perfectly nice, and, but that there's, that's it. And um, and then I'm here talkin' to you, and, and it's easy, and it's fun, and, and I don't, I don't have to...You know, here's a wacky thought. Um, what's say you and I give it another shot? No no no, I know what you're gonna say, you're a lesbian. But what do you say we just put that aside for now you know? Let's just stick a pin in it, ok? Because, we're great together, you know. You can't deny it. Besides, you're carrying my baby. I mean, how perfect is that? But see, you know, you keep sayin' that, but there's somethin' right here. I love you.
Oh, god. You know, this is still pretty hot.
Mushroom. Smile. They won't all be like this. Some women might even stay through dinner. Sorry, that's not funny
Oh, I love you too. But...
No but, no but.
